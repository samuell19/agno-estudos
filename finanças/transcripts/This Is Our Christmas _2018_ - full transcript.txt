(dramatic music) ("Jingle Bells") (horn honking) (screaming) (crashing) (light dramatic music) - Angelina Foxworth, what can I do for you? - Well, I'm tired of being in limbo, and I wanna go home back to Earth for the holiday. I miss my family. - Hm, interesting. How about some caviar, some oysters, some champagne, maybe a yacht thrown into that list too, huh? How would that be? - Actually, that sounds pretty good. - Apparently you're not really qualified for much of anything right now, least of all another Earth visit. I heard somewhere that you violated several major rules last time, hm? Based on that I can't really help you, I'm sorry. - Oh, God. - [God] Who used my name in vain? - Angelina Foxworth, 9021080-- - [God] You may never use my name in vain again. - Yes, sir. - [God] Place her on probation and do the right thing. - Probation? - Look on the bright side. At least you get to go back to Earth and see your family for the holidays, but you must make a very significant change in your family, but please remember what I'm about to tell you now. This is your last opportunity to leave limbo. Please don't disregard it. If you do you will go back into limbo and you will never have a chance to see your family every again. Are we clear on all these points that I brought up? Are we clear? - Hell yes. - Excuse me? - Heck yes. - That's better. You have yourself a very merry Christmas. - Thank you. You too. - Don't forget to keep that scarf on you. - [Angelina] I won't. (festive music) (muffled chatter) - This tree is so beautiful. We've only been here for six months and it already feels like home. - Yes, but the mansion was way bigger. I mean, I can't even fit my usual size Douglas fir here. - Honey, it's the holidays. Be happy. Lucille, Raven. - Leave it, James. She'd just be sitting here on her phone anyways. - Give her a break, she's 16. - Here, I found some more old ornaments. - Thank you, Lucille. - Aunt Maggie? - She has a bakery on the east side. - I remember you telling me about her. - I heard she's not doing that well though. - Too much sugar will do that to you. - I think we should pay her a visit. - You and Raven should pay her a visit. - [Raven] Dad? - We're in here. Raven, do you remember your Aunt Maggie? - You mean Auntie Coocoo? Yeah, she's been sending me Christmas books every Christmas since I was nine. - If you don't want them, I'll take them. - Your dad thinks he should go visit her. - Well, nevermind about that. Why are you both out of breath? - There was a major pipe break across the street from the soup kitchen. - Was there any damages? - No, not on the inside, but the city said it could take up to two weeks to repair the pipe. - And meanwhile, the soup kitchen's closed. - Well that's too bad with Christmas right around the corner. - Deacon Scott is hopeless. Dad, you have to do something. - I'm sorry honey, but pushing the water department to fix a leak during the holidays is a little bit out of the realm of what I can do. - Dad, really? You know the mayor. - I know the mayor, but he's a very busy gentleman. - I bet if Mom was here she could certainly do something about it. - Raven dear, your father's right. Something like this unfortunately is out of his hands. - Raven, I was thinking, how do you feel about helping your Great Aunt Maggie? - What? No, go to the mountains? - She doesn't live in the mountains. We just visited the one Christmas in Big Bear. She has a bakery on the east side. - No, I'm not going there. - Excuse us, you're going. - I am not going anywhere. - Raven. - I am made as hell and I'm not gonna take this anymore. Come on, Jerry. - What was that? I mean, are you okay with that? 'Cause I'm not. - Don't worry, darling. It's a classic quote from the movie network. - So, if I get married and start dancing in the fountain that's okay, because I'm just quoting Fellini's la dolce vita scene in the Trevi Fountain, right? - I think that would be kinda funny. - I think we should find her something else to do for the holidays. - I agree with you. - I just don't want the neighbors to hear all that screaming. - They won't hear us, just live a little. - Enough of this nonsense. - Listen, I organized a reunion with Aunt Maggie, don't worry, I have a plan set. - You better. - Oh my, look what time it is. I have an appointment at the Chamber of Commerce. Okay, sweetheart, love you. - [Molly] Love you. - Molly's really starting to get on my nerves. - She's just trying to be your mom. - No she's not, she's just trying to get rid of me. - You think? - I don't wanna talk about her. - So, why don't you tell me more about Aunt Cookie? - Aunt Maggie. I don't know, her and my mom were best friends, then all of a sudden they just didn't talk anymore. - Well, you know I haven't seen snow in quite some time, I could turn it into a little vacation for you and I. - Nope. Bunny, do you wanna go see Aunt Maggie? Don't bark if you wanna go see Aunt Maggie. - Looks like he wants us to go see Aunt Maggie. - Do you wanna stay here and play instead? - At least somebody agrees with me. (light music) - Yeah, I agree, we should look at the easements on both those properties. - Well, we'll have the opportunity of presenting our plans at next week's city commission meeting. - I'm not sure the city of Beverly Hills needs more mixed-used development. - Wait, what? I can't believe you'd be opposed to this, James. - [James] It's not that I'm opposed it it-- - Then what is it? I mean, it's the wave of the future. - I live for days just like this, fellas. That's why we got into the business. - That's right. - Did you see the expression on her face? - The expression of I just lost seven figures to these guys. Woo! - I'll be dreaming about it tonight. - Dreaming, that's my queue. - What? - Yeah, I'm tired. And you guys are celebrating and talking business and I want you to be able to do that and I feel like-- - It's the biggest deal in the firms history. One last cheers before you go? - Yeah. - One cheers. To you guys. No, you guys deserve it, honestly, congrats. Okay, my Uber's here. - Okay. - Love you forever. - Love you forever. - Okay guys, have fun. - Thank you. - Don't be too naughty. - Lucille will see you to the door. Nathan, you're one lucky guy. - You are lucky. You're lucky and we're rich, fellas. What a great day. What a great day, ready to go again? - [James] Let's review the other proposals first. - Oh, I agree with James. - Welcome back to Earth, Nate. - Perry, can you get me Betford file? - Sure, I'll get right on that. Nate, do you have a minute? - Yeah. - [James] What's up, buddy? - Oh, look I'm sorry I just, I just haven't been in the game, I guess. - It's about Laura, right? - Yeah, I should've been driving that night. - Nate, it's not your fault. None of this is your fault. She would want you to be happy. - I just wish I could see her again. - I know the feeling. It's been several years since I lost my first wife, and not a day goes by that I don't wish she was with me. - I see her in the light. I miss her smile, I miss her laugh. (dramatic music) (blinker clicking) (horn honking) (crashing) - [James] Look, let's go look at the plans. (chiming) - Hey, hey-- - What the heck. - Have you seen my reindeer? - No. - I can't find them and Santa doesn't like it when I'm late. - How can you see me? - I'm an elf, duh. I can see you. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - [Molly] How does Nathan feel? - Not so good, he feels guilty. - Enough with the pity party, he needs to move on already. - [James] Aren't you being a bit harsh? He lot his wife. - Mrs. Foxworth. - Yes? Lucille? (chiming) - I'm sorry, I think I heard your cell phone ringing in the other room, Mrs. Foxworth. - Okay, let me go check. - Lucille can you remind me of my schedule tomorrow with the Chamber of Commerce in Beverly Hills and my medical appointment and also do I have that meeting over at BucksBees? - And since when I was promoted to a secretary? I thought I was just a housekeeper here? (light dramatic music) - [Yvonne] Yvonne is here. - Ding dong the witch is here. - Ding dong the witch is here. - I heard you, Uncle James. - I wasn't trying to whisper. - [Yvonne] That's nice. - So, give me the bad news first. - No bad news, I just came by to take Aunt Molly Christmas shopping. - So then I should block all my credit cards? Once again, how did you get that new Bentley outside? - I got it at a charity auction. - A charity auction. - Yvonne. - Hey, how's my favorite cousin? Busy? - Yeah, I'm just trying to buy something on Net-a-Porter, but it won't let me, my credit card number won't work. - You mean my credit card number? So, what are you buying now, Raven? A new FREDDY yacht for your trip to South Beach? (laughing) - Just doing some early holiday shopping. Christmas is in a few days. Let me guess, you haven't even started Christmas shopping yet? - Ah, James. - And what's wrong with that? - Every year you spend panicking up and down Rodeo just to buy Molly another useless piece of jewelry. Surprise her. Send her to a retreat in Mexico. - I beg your pardon, Raven? - Duh. - Raven, I always buy everyone's gifts first. - Lies. - Pardon me? (dramatic music) - What is it? - Hi, Aunt Molly. - Thanks for coming. How's your boyfriend. - Ugh, I got rid of him. - Oh, I'm sorry to hear. - I'm not. - So, what's everybody talking about? - Nothing that concerns you. - About life. - Yeah, life sucks and then you die. - Raven, please behave. - I really don't know what to get my nieces and nephews. - Maybe because you never see them. - Maybe because I work hard everyday. - Saint Molly. - Raven, since we have you here, we decided that you're gonna visit your Aunt Maggie for the holiday. - I'm what? - You're going to visit with your Aunt. - For my entire break? - Lucille will be packing your bag. - I can pack my own case. Is this a joke? - No joke? - What about Jerry? - They'll appreciate another set of hands. Get ready, you're leaving in one hour. - No. - [Yvonne] She okay? - Oh, she'll live. The girl needs a kick in the butt. Come on, Yvonne, let's go. (sighs) (light music) (chiming) * Smiling through these tears * * Facing my worst fears * * Don't you know-- * - Mom, why'd you have to leave me so early? I hate it here. I miss you so much. - Love, life is beautiful. I want you to go see my sister. She's a lovely lady. * To carry on * - And I was wrong about her. * Without you by my side * - She needs your help. * But I'm smiling * - Give me a sign if you want me to go see Aunt Maggie. Make Bunny nod. * I'm smiling to a tear * - Bunny, nod. Come on, Bunny. (chiming) - Really? Mom? (dramatic music) - [Maggie] That is absolutely beautiful. - Yeah, they are. - Look at these. Aren't they pretty? They turned out really well. - They did. - Maggie. - Oh, not Kevin, I told you last week that I will call you when I am ready to pay. (chuckling) - I'm afraid it's a bit more complicated than that, Maggie. - But, look Kevin, I have been in this shop for 30 years. I am an institution in this town. - Well, I guess the collectors don't like your sugar cookies anymore, Maggie. - What? - I have a bitter one for you. You have one week left, which means your deadline's the day after Christmas. So you better start collecting your money or you can start selling cookies off a van in Griffith Park for all I care. - How dare you. - The day after Christmas, Maggie. - Don't you dare walk out-- (gasping) - Maggie? Maggie, are you okay? - Oh, I'm fine. - You don't look fine. - Oh, I'm fine, I'm fine. Um, I tell ya what, Doll, go outside to see who's there, why don't you? - Oh, okay. - Okay. (somber music) (sighs) - Right this way. (light music) - Aunt Maggie. - Well, this is a great surprise. Just look at y'all. Oh, my goodness James, it's just giving me the chills to see y'all here. - It's been a very long time. How have you been? - I couldn't be better. I couldn't be better. Oh, my goodness, I would know this child anywhere. There's a very big family resemblance. - Hi, Aunt Maggie. - Hi. So, to what do I owe this pleasant surprise? - First, we'd like to place a family order. - What are y'all gonna have? Whoa, all this, huh? - You know how the Foxworths love to entertain. - I am thankin' the Lord for that. This is gonna keep me mighty busy. - Not to worry, I brought you some help. - Oh, really? - Ready for duty. - Well, that would be great. We have an event up in Crows Roost and to have some extra help would really be great. - Crows Roost? Like in the Big Bear Mountains? - Yes, that's the one. It's lovely up there. - Raven, it's gonna be fine. Aunt Maggie, thank you for taking care of her. - Well, it is my pleasure to do so. Well, come on in, y'all. Come on in to the shop and take a look at the place. Come on in. - Hey. - Hey, do you mind if I sit. - [Nina] Oh, not at all. What's your name? - Raven, what's yours? - Nice to meet you, Raven. I'm Nina. - [Raven] So how long have you been baking? - Uh, I've been baking for a few years now. Yeah, it's been really great working for Maggie. - Yeah, she's pretty cool. - Yeah. Do you have any interest in baking? - Yeah, my Mom loved baking. - Oh, does your mom still bake? - No, she died. - Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. - [Raven] It's okay. - I could teach you how to bake. - Really? - Yeah. - That'd be great, sure. - All right, let's go for it. Let's five. (slapping) Do you wanna start with pies or cookies. - [Raven] Cookies, they're my favorite. - Yeah, they're so much more fun. (laughing) (light music) - Thanks for helping with this, Yvonne. I can't believe how hard it is to shop for James. - Have you tried Stefano Ricci?. - I did, but then I realized I needed him there with me. - Oh, what is Raven getting him? - Who knows, the girl doesn't think about anybody but herself. Do you think I'm being too harsh with her? - Yeah, I think you are. That girl has been through a lot, she just lost her mom. - You're right, I need to bond with her more. I just wanted to spend more times with James. - What about if you guys planned a trip together somewhere? - That's a great idea. We haven't traveled for a while. Maybe Dubai or Paris. Maybe something simple like a road trip up the coast. - That's good. - Oh, no, that's not a good idea because that gets me one step closer to sleeping under the stars in a sleeping bag. (laughing) Can you imagine us cooking chow under the fire? - No, I cannot. What about if you drive up to Joshua Tree and camp? - Camping? No, you've lost your mind. (light music) (gasping) - Wow. We're here. Welcome to the mountain, city girl. - It's freezing. - Oh, see I'm glad it's not just me. Okay kids, I tell you what, why don't you all help unload the car? There you go, see that'll warm you right up. - Great. - This way. (giggling) Here we are. Careful. Whoops, here we go. Ah. Kids, I tell you what, why don't you leave your boxes out here and we can just get them later, okay? - Okay. - All right. - Perfect. Oh, my goodness. Well kids, welcome to Apples. Isn't it beautiful? I love it, it's so Christmasy. I tell you what, y'all sit down, you rest, I'm gonna go check in and I'm gonna get y'all some hot chocolate, okay? - Okay, Aunt Maggie. - Okay. - Hey, so thanks for coming with me and always being there for me. - Yeah, of course. I mean, you know I like you, so I'd do anything for ya. - This might sound a little weird, but you know how when you died and came back? - Mm hm. (dramatic music) - Recharging. - Recharging, charged. - Jerry, don't you give up on me. One more time, Jerry. Come on, come on, clear. - I feel like my mom came back with you or in you. - Well, I mean I guess souls don't really have a gender. But, I get what you mean. - I love you. - I love me, too. (laughing) I do love you, though. Just so you know. (light music) (muffled chatter) - [Boy] Come on, whoa! (light music) - [Raven] I think he's cuter that you. - I mean, honestly, our scarves are pretty much the same. - Take it off this for me. - Okay. - Just take it. - Get, ah no, it's caught in the back. Oh, it's stapled in the back. Crap, go, go. (light music) - [Man] Face first, is a whole lot easier. About that height, it just goes a little bit longer. You get to show them, right? - Keep warm. Did you see that? The old 97s are comin' to town. - We should go see them. - Maybe. We should go see The Bad Seeds. That would be a good one, right? Look at what I got you. - It's so-- - No, that's for Christmas, though. - No. - No, no, no, no, no, no. It's for, look I'll let you look at it, but it's for Christmas, all right? - It's so cute. - I know. That's why I got it. (birds chirping) (light music) - [Maggie] Aren't those beautiful, honey? - Yes. - [Maggie] I know, I made that apple crumble just for you, 'cause I know it is your favorite. - It's gonna be so good. - I know, I love it, I love it, too. Well hey there, Lenoir, how you doin' this morning? - [Lenoir] I'm just okay, it's 'cause of the arthritis. - [Maggie] Oh no. - All the baking I've been doing, but I see you made fruit tarts today. - You know, I sure did. There was a beautiful crop of apples I had to take advantage of it. Well, I tell you what, try yourself a sample. - All right? - All right. You just go right ahead, go ahead. What do you think? - Mm, what's in your crust? - Oh, a little bit of this, a little bit of that. - Mm hm. - I tell you what, why don't I give you a copy of the recipe. - [Lenoir] That would be fabulous. - Absolutely, you know what, I've got it right here. Here you go. - Thank you very much. - Oh, you are so welcome and you make sure to tell me how those turn out when you make 'em. - I will. - Okay. - Thanks. - Your welcome, bye. I am good. Jerry, sweetheart, could you lay off the snowballs for a little bit? Just leave us some snow. - All right. (light music) (birds chirping) This is great, isn't it? This place it kinda reminds me of Aspen a bit. - When were you in Aspen? - Never, but I mean you don't have to go to Aspen to know what it's like. - It's freezing. - Are you okay? You seem a little strange. - I'm okay, it's just cold. - Gotcha. Well, you wanna know my trick? I pretend that I'm in Miami-- - Wait, when were you in Miami? - Never, but I mean you don't have go-- - To go to Miami to know what it's like. - Bingo, you got it. - Right, got it. - Come on, let's go. (chiming) (sighs) - See, I made this one for you. Got cream coconut 'cause I know it's your favorite, you were in my head. Oh hey, there you are. - Thanks. - Hey. - Good to see that you didn't get lost in this booming metropolis. - Oh no, not at all. This one here, she is smart and pretty. Just like her mother. - Her mother? - Angelina. - Oh, we were good friends with your mom. Herb Bessa. - Raven Foxworth. - So why haven't we met before? - My parents are probably too busy with their own careers. - Oh, you know in an avalanche, each unique and beautiful snowflake pleads not guilty and I'll accept that answer. My oldest son lives three blocks from here and I haven't seen him in two months. - Well that's a darn shame. - Yeah, but I get to see pictures from Hawaii, right? And the grandkids, they send me sporting events on Facebook. - You're on Facebook? - To tell you the truth, Raven, these wrinkles on my face, this is a mask I'm wearing. I'm only 55. (laughing) - Aunt Maggie, you should join Facebook. - Oh, honey, what on Earth for? I don't even have a computer. - You have one at the bakery and to keep in touch. - You give me a call or you stop by, that is how you stay in touch. - Hey you guys, you know what, I'm gonna go unload the last load, all right? - Well thank you, sir. - Yeah, you know, on that note I'm gonna go home and raise my cholesterol levels. - [Maggie] All right. - Bye sweetie. - By Uncle Herb. - I like this girl. - I do too. And I'll see you next week, Herb. - Next week? Honey, I'll see you in my dreams, love. - Aw, thank you. - [Herb] Bye sweetie. - Bye Herb, drive safe. - Bye. - Bye. That man was really almost your uncle. - Really? - Oh yeah, he wanted to put buns in my oven and I only wanted to bake pies. You know what, I'll tell you what, it's lovely out here. I want you to go find your sweetie and I want you to go take a walk. - Seriously? - Yes, really. I can take of this, I got this. You go, you go have a good time. - Okay. - Okay. (light music) - [Boy] Dad! (children yelling) - Are you all right, are you all right? - Actually I think I've fallen for you quite literally in this way. - Don't hurt yourself. - All right. Thanks for the advice. (light music) Do you even know how to throw snowballs? (bell ringing) - [Maggie] Oh, hey. - Hi, Aunt Maggie. - You're back, how was it? - Awesome. Thanks for bringing us here. - Oh honey, you are more than welcome. - Are you busy? - Oh, just writing down a recipe. - Do you ever give away your recipes. - Well, I may leave out an ingredient or two. - No way. - Karma? - Oh, karma nothing. Somebody's gonna take this thing, they are gonna make it and then they are gonna claim it for their own. - Mm hm. - Mm hm. - So, you do this every Christmas? - I do. I know, it's pretty exhausting, but I love it up here. And I love seeing my friends. - Why don't you just live up here? - (laughing) Are you trying to get rid of me already? - No, no. - Oh, honey, honey, honey, I know what you mean. Why haven't I sold the farm? Or in this case, the bakery. And the truth is I really haven't put together the whole nest egg I need to retire. Unfortunately I'm missin' the yolk. But that's okay. That's okay, you know what, I tell you what, let's pack up the car. Let's do that because those roads out there they get very dangerous when it starts snowin'. - All right, yeah. We're on it. Yeah, we're on it. - Okay perfect. Here sweetheart, could you hold that? And could you take this one as well? Wonderful, terrific, and I will get our santa. - [Jerry] Awesome. (light music) - [Nina] All right, here you go. - Wow, these look absolutely spectacular. - Aw, thank you. - Thank you, so much. - Sure thing, Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas to you too. You know, there's an awful lot of cookies here. I was wondering if you wouldn't mind helping me eat these later on tonight. I could come by around 7:00, pick you up for dinner, we already have dessert. The cookies are no doubt as delicious as they look given, not to mention you would know. What do you say? - I am very, very flattered, but I have a boyfriend. - He's a very lucky guy, thank you so much for the cookies. Merry Christmas to you. - Merry Christmas to you. - [Man] Take care. - Mr. Foxworth, hi. - Hello, Nina, what a lovely Christmas tree. - Oh, thank you. - Have you seen Raven around? - Um, she's not back yet. Maybe there's something I could help you with, though? - Oh, no, no, I'm fine. Have you been busy? - Um, not really. Maggie hasn't been doing very well financially. So, you know, it's been hard. Yeah. Is there anything I can get for you though, while you're here? - Would you have any ideas on what I could get my wife for Christmas? - Cookies. - Cookies? - Cookies. - Cookies it is, then. - [Nina] All right, I'm gettin' some. There you go. - These are great and how much-- - Oh, they're on the house. - Thank you, Nina. - Yeah, no problem. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas to you. - Take care. - Drive safe. (festive music) (light music) * Come December * * Where all your dreams come true * * Come December * - [Maggie] Hey there, we're back. - [Nina] Hey, you're back sooner than I thought. - That's right. - Raven, your dad just left. - Oh. - So, tell me how was business today? - Well, it wasn't very busy, but I did just power clean everything. - Well, that's fantastic. It's fantastic. Oh dear. - Hm, yeah. - I see the dreaded mail carrier dared to show his face here again today. Oh my. - Yeah. - See y'all, I was really hoping that that coupon in the West Side Penny Saver was gonna bring some people in. - Isn't that the free paper that everybody gets tossed in their driveway? - [Maggie] It sure is. - And then the gardener runs it over? - Well, I guess that could happen. - Actually, it's usually the sprinkler systems that soak it. - Well, if you're a big water waster, then all right then. - Aw, so, how was the Crows Roost? - It was awesome. - Thrilling. - [Nina] Cool. - There you see, it was awesome. All right, I'm gonna go make up the supply order. Oh, put a ad in the Penny Saver, Maggie. There's a big circulation, yeah. - You know this place could use a few finishing touches. - Well then, I think you're the perfect person for the job. - Great idea. - But I must forewarn you ladies, I'm the Duke of Decorations. - Oh. - Okay, I mean I'm the master of crate paper. In fact, streamer, it's my middle name. - Aw, let's get you a ladder. - Yeah, why not. - Yeah. - [Maggie] Oh! (thudding) - Aunt Maggie. (chiming) - Oh, oh kids. Oh sweetie, I'm so sorry, this is so embarrassing. - Aunt Maggie, you need to take it slow. - Yeah, no, no, Aunt Maggie, why don't you just go home, get some rest, okay? We'll look after the bakery, don't worry. - You know, honey, I probably should. - Should I call a cab? - No, honey, darling, no. I'll call Herb to come pick me up. It's fine. Here, okay, here we go. Up. - Okay. - Oh, my goodness. - Here we go. There we go. - Okay. - All right. - Kids, could y'all make sure that everything's locked up here? - Of course. - Thank you, sweetheart. - All right, it's okay. Do you wanna rest on my shoulder. - Oh, honey, I don't wanna hurt you. - I'll do all right, just go slow. - Okay, whoa. - Just put one foot in front of the other, you got this. - Thank you, darling. - We should go home. - I'll get the lights. - All right. (light music) (chiming) (birds chirping) (light music) - So, are you ready to get started? - Get started? - Yeah, I mean, I don't know about you, but I really need this job. Also, I'm sure that your Aunt Maggie doesn't wanna lose the customers that she does have-- - To the cupcake people? - Exactly. - If my Mom was still here, she coulda taught me how to make Aunt Maggie's pies. (bell ringing) May I help you? - Yeah, I just came by to order a pie. No eviction notice this time. - A what? - A pie. This is a bakery, right? It's for my daughter. It's her birthday tomorrow. - Are you serious. - Raven, let me handle this. What kinda pie would you like? - A crumble pie. - A crumble pie, yeah, she'd love that. - That's great. - Good, so, tomorrow, same time? - Yeah. - I'll pick it up. - Sounds perfect. - Great, ladies. - So, why did he say eviction notice. - You should talk to your Aunt about that. Pretty tree though, huh? - Nathan. I'm gonna surprise them and have the pipes fixed. Ah, you sweetheart, how are you? Thank you, I very much appreciate that. I would love for you to be there. How are you? Nathan, before you answer, I want you to spend Christmas with our family, so come over around 6:00 p.m.. (light music) - [Nina] Oh, Mrs. Foxworth. - Well, hello. - Hi, what can I get for you? - Well, I'm here to order Maggie's famous apple crust pie. - Oh, unfortunately, we don't have any of those ready just yet, but I do have some chocolate cream. - Oh, I don't really like that. - Oh. - You know, I always order Maggie's famous apple crust pie. Well, she knows I always order it once a week when my boys come home for dinner. Is she here? - She's not in today. - Oh, I'm really out of luck. - But the pies should be out soon. - How soon? - Maybe five minutes? - Oh, I don't know. - I'll tell you what. Why don't you have a seat over there and I'll give you a cookie on the house while you wait. - What kind of a cookie? - Macadamia nut? - With that, you have a deal. - All right, I had a feeling. - Oh, and two. Thank you so much. - Absolutely. - You know, the bakery looks just beautiful. - Aw. - So Christmasy. - Aw, thank you. - I'll really enjoy this, thank you, again. - Please do. I'll let you know when the pies are up. - Oh, I'll let you know how it is. (sighs) Mm, delicious. Certainly worth the wait. (sighs) - This is so why I quit spin class. (light music) Grandma? - Raven. What are you doing here? What a surprise. - I work here. - Well, I didn't know that. Raven, I don't see enough of you. You have to come over more often. - Yes, Grandma. Do you need anything else? - No, I'm just waiting for my apple crust pies. Now you go ahead, I don't wanna make you late. - Okay. - Today we're taking up a collection for the children's hospital and Santa knows you'll give generously, because it's Christmas right here. Right here. Oh. - Do you work here? Can we get cake? - Excuse me? - Are you deaf? - I, I'm. - Oh, you know what, I'm happy to help you. What can we got for you? - Cake, we want cake. - Okay, cool, what kind of cake would you like? - Our cake? - Okay, and what kind of cake would you like your cake to be? (speaking foreign language) - Where is our cake? - Ah, you know what, I have your cake right here, it's a German Chocolate. - Was it so difficult? - Thank you. - Enjoy. (speaking foreign language) Oh, all right. Let me go check on my pies. (giggling) (light dramatic music) - Merry Christmas. (chuckling) Merry Christmas. (chuckling) Merry Christmas. (chuckling) Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas. (light music) - So, are they always so charming? - They're regulars, so we tend to overlook their more eccentric qualities. - Qualities? - In the most exaggerated definition of the word. - When my dad stopped by earlier, did he ask you for any suggestions for Christmas? - Yeah, it was lame. Like I have any idea what rich people get for each other. Also, since he did ask, I told him about our financial troubles. I thought maybe he could help. - What did he say? - He didn't say anything. (dinging) That's my cookies. Good job. - Those look and smell amazing, Nina. - Thank you. All right. Comin' out. - You know, keeping the displays filled isn't gonna bring in new customers. - You're absolutely right. You know what, I'm on it. - [Raven] Where are you going with that? - Uh, to captivate an audience. - That is a great idea. - [Raven] Bring some flyers with you. - Way ahead of ya. - Thanks, Jerry. (dinging) I've got it. (light dramatic music) Not again. - Is my pie ready? - Not yet. - Where's Maggie? - Not here at the moment. - This space right here, you'd say it's what, 12 by 20? It's a lot of really good space. - What an opportunist. - I stink at math. - Uh huh, but you can read, right? You tell Maggie, that this needs to be taken care of right away or I'll be forced to take another course of action. Soon. I'll be back later to pick up my pie. (chiming) - Go ahead, open it. - Ouch. - Ouch is right. (light music) - Oh look, it's Jerry. - Aw, you workin', Jerry? - Yes, I am, what gave it away? - Are these samples? - Yeah, they're for potential customers. - Are they low carb? Gluten free? - No, they're from a bakery. Raven's working at the bakery. - Raven? Raven Foxworth? Where's this bakery? - I don't see why that's important. - You know what, we'll find it ourselves, moron. - Where did that come... So rude. Steppin' all over Jerry. Whatever. (dinging) - Oh, hi. - Hi. Hey girls, you guys should enter this contest. I'm one of the judges and you could win $10,000. - The Out of the Box Holiday Bake Off? - Yes, I hear your pies are great. Anyway, I hope to see you there. Merry Christmas. - Bye. - Merry Christmas. - What's this about anyways? - Oh, it's a contest they do once a year in Crows Roost. - $10,000 is sure a lot of money. - Yeah, it would be really great right now because my dad's been out of work. - Oh, right. - Yeah. But speaking of baking desserts, I think that pie is gotta come out of the oven. (sighs) - It's my understanding that your interest lies in a much bigger project than just repossessing the bakery. - And where'd you get that information from? - I have my sources. - What do you want, Mr. Foxworth? - Well, I think I can help you. I'll be able to implement a plan that is far more profitable for you. - Like where? - Like here. Beverly Hills is one of the most desirable places to be in the entire world. - Is that why you brought me here? - Yes, indeed it is. Wouldn't you rather build your resort here than up in the woods? - Well, is it a guaranteed deal? - Let's just say it's a sure thing. Look, I could pay rent and you'll never hear from us again-- - [Turner] Why would you do that? - Do what? - Waste money? That bakery has been at a loss for the past two years. - Because I'm a benefactor and Maggie, she's family. - Doesn't sound like a business man I'm talking to. - Mr. Turner, it's not always about money. - Is that right? - My recommendation is for you to review these plans and reconsider. - Well, you've certainly spiked my interest, Mr. Foxworth, but I can't guarantee anything. But I will look at these prints. - Very good. - Wonderful. - Join me for lunch. We have a wonderful restaurant that's not too far from here. - Raven, we have a problem. - Oh, no. - I'll get the mop. - It's not you, it's the same leak that keeps happening over and over again. - This place needs a renovation. - Maggie just used to wrap the pipe in duck tape until she had time for the plumber to come. - We could always call the plumber from the soup kitchen. What was his name? Anthony, he works for cheap. - It's worth a shot. (light music) - How about you guys go get me a coffee instead of staring? Hey, I'm workin' here. Would you guys please get outa here? - So are we plum? - We are not plum. - Great. - Oh yeah, that's a good flavor, too. Plum? No one, Bueller? Tough crowd. - Gonna need a few more pieces to fix this. - Really? - Should only take a piece of drywall and some mud. - Right. Why don't you give it a try? - Since when do you know anything about drywall? - I watch the home improvement channel. - So who's gonna pay for this? - I guess we can put I on the bakery's account. - I'm gonna have to get full payment for that while I'm here today. - I'll get my card. - I'll need cash, please. - This has been a nightmare. (dramatic music) - Hi, Mrs. Hawkins. What can I do for you? - Well, I'm here to pickup my pecan pies. - Oh, well we're actually having a bit of a plumbing issue right now, so unfortunately we don't have any pies. - What kind of plumbing problem. Maybe I can help? - Help? I'm afraid you can't, but that's really nice of you to offer. - I was really hoping to have those today. I have a big family dinner. - Well, what about some of Maggie's cookies? They're delicious. - No, my nephews love their pecan pies. - When would you need them by? - Well, tonight, I guess. - Great, we'll see you then. - Well, that sounds marvelous. I'll stop by later then. - Why did you promise her pies? Our kitchen is down. - Look, Maggie's having some financial troubles. - Yeah, well, 10 pecan pies is not gonna change that. - We have to start somewhere. I know where we can bake in the meantime. - [Nina] Where? - The soup kitchen. - Well, who's gonna look after the shop, then? - Jerry. - [Nina] All right, I'll go look for the recipe. Excuse me. - Jerry, what? - You have to stay here. We're gonna go bake some pies. - Oh, where at? - The soup kitchen. - All right, I got it. Let's go. - Awesome. - We'll be back. - Hey, guys, for how long? Wait, guys? - Hey buddy, so who's gonna pay me? (sighs) - Oh. - I think it's ready. - You think? - Oh, I hope this works. Sorry I brought the wrong recipe. Can you get that? Thanks. - If it sucks we can just start over. - I like that attitude. - Now we just have to wait until it's not the temperature of liquid lava anymore. - A while, I guess? - Mm hm. You know, I think my mom had a copy of Maggie's pumpkin pecan pie recipe. What? - I know how Aunt Maggie shares her recipes. - Oh, the missing ingredient thing? Yeah, well, she never leaves out anything that's important. - Like pumpkin pecans. - Right, like pumpkins and pecans. I don't know, I feel like it doesn't' smell right. (sighs) - Oh mom, what would you do? (chiming) Hey Nina, is this the wrong recipe you took? - Yeah, that's the one. - Apple crumble? - Mm hm. - My mom used to make this all the time. I remember her saying it was Aunt Maggie's best recipe. - Oh, but so what? - It's the best pie I've ever had. How would you feel about joining forces and making Aunt Maggie's apple crumble for the contest? We can split the prize money. - I really wanted the prize money to give to my family. - I'll give my half to Aunt Maggie so she can keep open her shop and you can keep your job. - All right, it's a deal. High five. (slapping) Yes, all right. - I'll be right back. - Okay. What are we gonna do with you? Ow. I forgot the cinnamon. (light music) - [Scott] It's been a very different Christmas. Usually at this time of the year we're all very excited with the Christmas dinner preparation. - [James] No, I understand. - My main concern are the children. They won't have a place to celebrate Christmas if we don't find a solution very soon. - Well, Deacon Scott, as I told you, I called the mayors office and he's going to do everything today to fix it. His office will be calling you shortly. - Sounds marvelous, and I'll add some prayers. (sighs) So, what exactly is bothering you, Mr. Foxworth? - My daughter, Raven, she's been difficult to deal with lately. - Well, she's at that age. I wouldn't worry your mind too much about it. - Has she been visiting you? - Yes, she's actually at the soup kitchen in the church right now. - Really? I thought it was closed. - Well, I had them open the kitchen for her. She said something about she had to make some pies for her Aunt's bakery. Apparently they're having a plumbing problem as well. What's wrong now? - Nothing. I think I'm gonna pay a little visit to the soup kitchen and speak to her. - Well, Amen. I can be there if need be. - That's great. * Amen, Amen * - Is there anything else that I can do for the church? - Oh, Mr. Foxworth, you've done quite enough for the church. - It's my pleasure. - By the way, Dad, what are you doing here? - Well, I decided to place an order for the soup kitchen. - Dad, really? - I gave a lot of thought to what you said to me, Raven, and I pulled a few strings at City Hall, and Christmas dinner is on. - Great. More baking. - What's wrong, Raven, you look concerned? - It's just Aunt Maggie, she's not doing so well. - Hm. Well... We're all in God's hands. (light music) - [James] Nathan. Nathan. - So, once you have it rolled you wanna kinda use the rolling pin to fill in all the cracks. It's really important to keep the pie, hey. - [Raven] Ingredients for two pies, did you get it? - Yup, got one bag of flour right here. - Awesome. - It's on. - And you know your assistant is ready, willing and able. (slapping) - Bam, let's do this. - Let's do it. - All right. - All right. - Let's do it. - Let's do it. - Have you ever used a peeler? I think I'm gonna put you on apple duty so grab that knife. - All right. - I'm gonna give the cutting board in just a second. And you've got this. Ready. - There we go. (shrieking) - Step one. Looks good. (humming) See how much fun this is? Don't forget this bowl, too. (laughing) - What? - Bakin' a pie. - We did it. - Phew. - Well, we did it. We made a pie. - Hey, so, any word on Aunt Maggie? - She feels much better. She'll be at the shop tomorrow. - Good, and this pie smells amazing. - I just hope that it tastes as good as it smells. - Yeah. - Try some. - Yeah, yeah? - [Raven] Try a bite. - Okay. That's amazing. - Is it? - Mm hm, try it. - No, I'll just. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Okay. - Like, how good? - Like, really, really good. Raven, try some. - [Nina] It is so good. - I told you. - Oh, my gosh. We made that. - [Jerry] We did. - We're a pretty good team. - [Jerry] I'm pretty proud of us, yeah? - I think we're gonna win. - Yeah, that's amazing. - Oh, it's so (moaning). Well, don't eat it all. This is a winning pie. - Well, don't eat all of it. - I know, don't. Save some for the rest of us. - I mean, come on. Yeah, exactly. - Oh, my gosh, it's so good. That's amazing. (giggling) (dinging) - Morning. - Oh. - Morning. - Morning. - Morning. Here you go, sweetheart. - Oh, Aunt Maggie has a rule about there being no pets in the shop. - I told you I have to go to work today. - Well, he can't stay here. - Well, you have to keep him. I can't take him and I can't leave him in the car. Gotta go, bye sweetheart. - Bye Uncle Steve. - It's all right, Raven, we'll work it out. - Okay. - He's really cute. - Bunny, stay here. - All right, let's go check on those pies. - Raven, I don't think this is a very good idea. Bunny. Don't even think about it, Bunny. No. Bunny, no! Bunny! Ugh, Bunny! Bunny, stop! No, Bunny, Bunny, stop! Bunny, stop! What's happening to my powers. Oh, no. Bunny, stop! Bunny, you're ruining everything there. Please, God, help. Help, God. God, help. Raven. - Oh, my gosh, Bunny! (gasps) - My pie. Oh, no, my pie! What are we gonna do? - I don't think he looks right. - Of course, he doesn't look right. He just ate an entire pie that is bigger than him. - Somebody call 911. Somebody call 911, Jerry please. - You don't call 911 for a dog. - Quick, please, call the vet. - You call the vet. Get him out of here. He's a little monster. (chiming) - Oh, God. - It's gonna be all right. It's gonna be all right. (crying) (light somber music) (chiming) - [Maggie] Hey there. - Hey Aunt Maggie. - Hey Aunt Maggie. - Morning. - Morning. - Mornin'. - So, how is Bunny? - He's okay. The vet said he was pooping nonstop. - Oh, that's great to hear. Oh, my goodness. I am gonna miss this place. - I'm sorry, Aunt Maggie. - No, sweetheart, no. What you two girls tried to do for me was so nice. But saving this bakery is something you couldn't have done anyway. It's been a longtime coming. - I guess I'm gonna have to find a new job. - [Maggie] Oh, honey, no. - Only a miracle could save us. - God, can you please help them? (light music) - Hey there, good morning. - [Martin] Morning. - [Maggie] How are you doin' this morning? - Wonderful, thank you. - Lovely, well, how may we help you this morning? - Last week a young man was passing out samples from your bakery. - Oh. - That was Jerry. - Jerry, yes. - Well, I have found I have not been able to get the thought of that delicious crumble out of my mind ever since. - Oh. - It had a tangy cherry filling with a buttery, crunchy oatmeal topping. It was delicious. - Oh. - Pardon my distraction. - [Raven] No worries. - Oh, well thank you. That's lovely. And how may we help you today, Mr.-- - Thomas. Martin Thomas. (chiming) And I'm here to buy your recipe. - What? The Rich and Flour Company? - Really? - Young lady, there's two things I never joke about: money and baked goods. And in this case, your baked goods are money. - How much money? - Well, I can't really discuss exact figures at the moment. - Ballpark? - Well, let's just say it's a very, very nice ballpark. - Oh. (light music) Sweetheart, why don't you give your father a quick call. - You got it. - And, Mr. Thomas, why don't we bring out some lemon filled cookies for you to enjoy until he gets here. - Sounds lovely. - Oh absolutely, you just go have a seat and we'll be them right on out. - Thank you very much. - Of course. - I'm right on it. - There you go and girls. Just one moment. (light music) - They sure have been talking for a long time. - Yeah, and no one's smiling. - Poker faces. - It's freezing out there. - Well, at least you have that elf cap to keep you warm. - And it's Southern California. - Yes, it's a good deal. Do it. - So, what do you think? - You got yourself a deal. - A tentative deal. Of course, until Maggie's lawyer reviews the proposal. - Why, of course. - This is exactly what I wished for for Christmas. A true miracle. - We aim to please. - It really is one, isn't it? - Well, it was very nice meeting you, but I've got another appointment tonight. - Oh, you're gonna buy yourself a few more recipes tonight, are ya? - No, actually I'm playing Santa Claus again this year at the Children's Hospital. - Aw. - That is wonderful. - I love the kids, I do it every year. - Well, look at you. - I'll be in touch. - Yes, absolutely. - Take care of yourself, Martin. - Bye now. - Goodbye and thank you. (light music) Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Was that too obvious? - So, do we have a deal? - Well, darlin', it sure looks like it. (laughing) - Oh, look at the time. I have to get to the jewelry store before they close. - What? - Just kidding. - Oh. - Oh, that's cute. - Aunt Maggie. - Yes? - This year instead of buying gifts, Molly and I decided to give you this. - What is this? Oh, my goodness. Oh, my. Thank you, thank you all so much. You all have been so kind to me. You've been so kind. Thank you, James. - You're welcome. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Nina, darlin', we gotta go finish those pies. - Pie. - I'll come with you guys. - I love you, Dad. - I love you too, Raven. Your mom would be so proud of you. I'll see you tonight. - Thanks for the baking lesson, Mom. - You're welcome, sweetheart. - Mom? - I love you. (chiming) (light music) * Silent night * * Holy night * * All is calm, all is bright * * Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child * * Holy infant so tender and mild * * Sleep in heavenly peace * * Sleep in heavenly peace * (glass clinking) - Hello, everyone and Merry Christmas. - [All] Merry Christmas. - The holidays are such a very special time for everyone, and for me it is so dear. I get to reunite with family and friends and to celebrate each and every one of you, for you have played such an important part in my life. I'm so blessed for Molly and for the joy you've brought in my life. And I'm also very blessed for my first wife, Angelina. For as without her I would not have blessed with such a beautiful daughter, Raven. She would've been so proud of the young lady you've developed into. - Uh, James, if you don't mind I'd like to say something. - Yes, Maggie. - Well, oh my. It isn't everyday that you go from the edge of bankruptcy, on your way to becoming a household brand. Oh, city mouse. I know I haven't seen you since you were four, but I'm sure glad you reentered my life when you did. Thank you, honey. Thank you, sweetheart. - And Merry Christmas again. - [All] Merry Christmas. (light music) - So, are you having fun? - Yes, it's a beautiful party. Lucille. - Yes? - Thank you so much for taking care of me all these years. - Oh, honey, it's my pleasure. You know you can always count on me. You're like a daughter to me. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Hey. - I don't even know, yeah. - Kevin. - Hey, Maggie. - I am really glad that we could work things out. Thank you so much for your patience. - Well, thank you and thank you for paying in full. (laughing) You know, thank you for this invitation. It's just so lovely. - So, Aunt Maggie wanted me to give you this for the soup kitchen. - This is an awfully nice donation. It's very generous. - We gave Aunt Maggie the money and she wanted you to have it. - Oh, well, are you sure she doesn't need it? I mean, I know she's been having some troubles. - No, she's fine now. - Oh, well thank you. - Merry Christmas, Herb. - Merry Christmas to you too, sweetheart. - You look good. - Thank you. - You're welcome. This is, it's nice, a nice party. Everything's decorated really, really nice. (light music) (chiming) - Laura? - Nathan. You can see me? Merry Christmas, my love. - I think about you every day. - I know. But our spirits must separate. - Don't. - I've gotta go. Love you forever. - I love you forever. (chiming) Mrs. Foxworth I... - Are you all right? You look like you've seen a ghost. - I guess you could say I have. - Now everything comes to the man who waits. Ever since I lost my husband I've always believed in guardian angels. So I'm certain that one, maybe even two, might be watching over our family right now. - Yeah. It's gettin' chilly out here, come on. - You know, I made a wonderful souffle. A surprise-- - You did? - Oh, I haven't done it in years, 'cause you know how private I am. - Right. - I never go out much, but I thought it would be a wonderful Christmas surprise to all of you. - Okay, well I can't wait to try it. - This is lovely. - It's gorgeous, but I tell you what, I need the name of your tailor. (chuckling) - That's Louis Bion, he's out in Milan. - Okay, okay, I like it. - By the way, have you seen Nathan? - Yeah, I think he walked outside for some fresh air. - Thank you. - Yeah. (doorbell ringing) (light music) - It's all right Lucille. I'll handle this. Nice to see unusual visitors here. May I help you? - Yes, I'm missing my pet Rudolph, and my old friend here believes he may be in your back garden. - Oh, really? - Do you mind if we go take a look? - No, I suppose not. - Aw, thank you ma'am. - Lucille will show you the way. Lucille, Lucille we have very special guests. It's Santa. Now you be nice to Santa. Hurry up, we don't have all day Santa. (chuckling) - Who's that at the door, grandma? - Well, it was Santa and his elf. - That's a bit odd. - Well, you see, he thinks he lost one of his pets in our backyard. - Really, and what is his pet's name? - Well, Rudolph of course. - And you let him in? - Well, they seem legit, and they were so nice. You should've seen his elf shoes. They were fabulous. I'd love to own a pair. - Well-- - You know, I have decided that I'm not gonna be so private in the new year. Do you think he bought those shoes at the North Pole? - I'm not sure. Let's go find out. - This is so exciting to have Santa in our backyard. (light music) (chiming) - Now, do you see what I see? - If you do, then I do. (jingling) (light music) - Hey, you made it back. Just in time I might add. - I didn't think I had a choice. - You don't. But apparently you were very successful in your mission. - Does that mean I don't have to go back to limbo? - Only a pardons. - Thank you. Say, do you ever take time to go down there? - Me? No, not anymore. Everyone I love is here. - I can't wait till that day comes. Wait a minute, I can wait. - You get there by taking one step at a time. - Thank you. - You're welcome. (light music) (crickets chirping) (light festive music)
