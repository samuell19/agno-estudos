Hollywood is a village, and once you upset the villagers, they talk and they gossip and they rumor and they have blood on their hands. And I hope they wash them with very hot water because the way they treated brittany murphy when she was alive was terrible. hi. My name is brittany murphy, and I go to herbert hoover middle school. Narrator: She was a unique talent with unlimited potential. Garcia: You could just tell that she was going to be a star. Narrator: But at the age of 30, brittany murphy mysteriously perishes. 32-year-old women just don't drop dead at home. This sort of makes everybody go, "what?" narrator: In this special report, we reveal the troubling dynamics... Ebner: He cut her off from the outside world, controlled her mind. Narrator:In the relationship that came to define her... The more this man talked, the more suspicious he became how about stories that you are a svengali? Svengali? Yeah. I should be so lucky. narrator:Speak exclusively with members of her family... She's my daughter. She was everything to me. It was terrible, unbelievably terrible. Narrator:And reveal the explosive accusation that casts everything in doubt. Garcia: He suspected that his daughter had indeed been poisoned. What was going on inside that house? sharon: Brittany, please come back! Garcia: It's 8:00 a.M. On a Sunday, December 20, 2009. And this frantic call comes into 911 from a house in the hollywood hills. Very calmly and professionally, the 911 operator is asking questions relevant to the situation. But the woman is absolutely beside herself and frantic. Garcia: It's clearly an urgent matter. It is clearly an emergency. So the 911 operator tells the mom to check if anything is blocking her daughter's mouth. The husband of the woman who's not breathing on the floor, he's entered the picture. He gets down on his knees, and he starts administering cpr. narrator: Within minutes, paramedics arrive at the site of the emergency, a mansion in the hollywood hills. Ebner: They are met by sharon, the mother of the woman on the bathroom floor and her son in law, a man named simon monjack. He's a 40-year-old heavyset englishman. They go inside. The bathroom the bathroom is cluttered. It's full of cosmetics and hair products. And they see a famous hollywood actress, 115-pound brittany murphy. Narrator: The struggling woman is a hollywood superstar whose story begins three decades earlier. Dimond: Brittany murphy was born on November 10, 1977. Her parents were sharon murphy and angelo bertolotti. They had an interesting connection, and they met under sort of unusual circumstances. Ebner: Angelo bertolotti, he's new york city born and bred and wound up in florida, where he owned night clubs. Angelo had a shady background. He was from the mob. He met sharon, and he hired her to work in one of his clubs. She was kind of attracted to that lifestyle, the fountains of cash that ran through that business. Narrator: The couple soon weds. But angelo's flashy ways quickly lose their luster. Angelo was in and out of jail quite a bit, and so the marriage didn't last. They divorced when brittany was just 2 years old. Bertolotti: My name is angelo j. Bertolotti, and my daughter is brittany murphy. Well, yeah, I was involved in my business and little with the marriage. Sharon knew I was involved in organized crime. I did nine years in prison. I got in a lot of trouble. So in 1980, fed up, sharon took brittany and moved to edison, new jersey. To support her and her daughter, sharon is working in advertising. Narrator: As they settle in to suburban life, young brittany starts to show a penchant for entertaining. Man: Brittany, how are you doing today, brittany? Great. How are you? Very good. You want a job hosting a television show? Sure. By the time she's 9 years old, she's pointing at the television and saying, "look, mommy, I want to be there, I want to be on tv." give us your name and what school you go to. hi. My name is brittany murphy, and I go to herbert hoover middle school. Bertolotti: She was very talented, yeah. Extremely talented. A very precocious child. I'll tell you what. I'm gonna give you a shot, and you get to interview. I'll have you interview people over here. Okay, sure. Hi. Do you like the fair here today? Yeah. What's your name? Carissa. Where are you from? Edison. Here's a young brittany, who is just shining on this video. You could just tell that she was going to be a star. Narrator: Soon enough, brittany sights are set far beyond new jersey. She heads to hollywood with her mother by her side. Hammond: Sharon was pretty much brittany's pillar. They were more of a friendship as opposed to mother and daughter. Ebner: If it wasn't for the age difference, you would almost mistake them for sisters. In fact, they considered each other soul mates. Hammond: As brittany murphy got her first job, she started subsidizing her and her mother's living. The relationship turned more daughter-mother. So brittany ended to looking after her mother as opposed to the opposite way around. Narrator: In 1995, brittany's fortune changes dramatically. Garcia: "clueless" was a blockbuster of a movie. It was basically about young girls in los angeles, and brittany played a girl who was picked on and she has this metamorphosis in the movie. In fact, so many people thought that brittany murphy upstaged the star, alicia silverstone. Hammond: "clueless" was a huge moment for brittany murphy in her career. But she was still typecast as the fat, plump brunette. So over a period of time, she got thin and went blonde, and people took notice and she started getting bigger roles. Other offers come fast and furious... "8 mile", "sin city." she could play dumb. She could play smart, inquisitive, comedy. Narrator: As the star's career evolves, so does her love life. She had a tendency to date her leading men. When she was on "8 mile", she dated eminem. She did a movie with ashton kutcher, and she ended up dating ashton, too. There was a really wonderful friendship that bloomed on the set of a film. We were not a pair until I would say 10 months or 11 months after the making of the film. But the relationships really don't go anywhere. She dates them for just a few months, and she doesn't really find love. Narrator: But in 2006, she encounters a man who will change her life forever. Ebner: Brittany reads a script based on the novel "the white hotel." she loves what she reads, and she makes it her mission to meet the screenwriter, simon monjack. Monjack: I'm linda monjack. I am the mother of simon monjack. When he was about 10 or 11, we went to disney, and he said, "I'm gonna live here one day." and I'm going to be in the movies. Simon was a writer and a filmmaker and a cameraman. He could find the soul in someone through the camera lens. That was one of his amazing attributes. Ebner: Simon made a name for himself as a creative force behind george hickenlooper's "factory girl." it was a movie that was loosely based on the life of andy warhol's muse edie sedgwick. Garcia: Simon and brittany, they'd already known each other casually. They really had no firm connection, though, until that 2006 movie project. That's when things seemed to click. Ebner: Brittany and simon, they met, they discuss business, but it was not just business. He's an english gentleman. Eight years her senior, big, burly, protective, dignified, well-spoken englishman. Brittany is smitten. She's met the man of her dreams. Monjack: And he phoned me the very day. He said, "I've met this crazy girl, mom. She's a crazy, crazy girl, but I think I'm a bit in love with her." I said, "oh, simon, you've only just met her." he said, "she is an amazing woman, and I'm falling for her now." narrator: Simon and brittany start dating. And within a year, they get married. It was done very quickly. I didn't know until after the marriage, but I know simon was very impulsive, and I accepted that. This was simon's third marriage and his first marriage that he was really in love. Ebner: Right off the bat, sharon moves in with them. Their home in the hills is a $3.9 million home. It used to be owned by brittany spears. Brittany and simon were going to start a new life. Narrator: Two years later, brittany murphy is unconscious on her bathroom floor. When the paramedics arrive at brittany's home, they immediately take control of the situation. They check her vital signs, and it doesn't look very good. In fact, it looks pretty grim. But then suddenly, they detect a very weak pulse. They rush her to the ambulance. Brittany murphy's life is hanging by a thread. Narrator: 32 year old actress brittany murphy is fighting for her life. While brittany's in the ambulance, the paramedics are working so hard to keep her alive until they can get her to the hospital. Behind the ambulance in a car is simon and sharon. It must have seemed like the longest ride of their lives. They hightail it right to cedars-sinai hospital. Inside, they're trying to do everything to revive this woman. Doctors are trying to get her heart started. Modern medicine is working overtime. And yet, it's hopeless, it's too late. And at 10:05 a.M. At cedars-sinai hospital, brittany murphy is declared dead. Garcia: And the doctor said that he was sorry but there was nothing he could do. Sharon is hit hard by the news and just falls apart. She has just lost her only daughter. Simon phoned me and just said, "brittany has died." he was totally and utterly devastated. And I just felt so ill. I couldn't breathe. It was the most awful moment that this beautiful, wonderful, talented, amazing individual could die. Bertolotti: I was in shock. I got a phone call. I was living in florida at the time. Really knocked me out. I couldn't believe it, really. It was my daughter. She was everything to me. As soon as brittany's passing leaks out to the media, they swarm. Hollywood has been stunned today by the death of a rising young star. Kiedis: We did a little thing together one day for the mtv awards, and I was stricken by her presence and her beauty and her charm, and now she's gone. She was such a talent. I really loved her. Very sad, a lot of questions, obviously, swirling around what happened. Yeah, well, we'll find out. Narrator: As the public mourns the loss of a rising star, los angeles authorities are in search of answers. Winter: My name is ed winter. I was the assistant chief for the I.A. County coroner's office during the brittany murphy investigation. I oversee all the high profile celebrity death investigations in the county, including michael jackson, whitney houston. We got a copy of the medical records and the admissions blood and then responded to brittany's residence. The media was all outside the house. They were asking cause of death. Was there any trauma to her body? Was there any foul play? And I advised them that we would be doing a autopsy and come out with the findings as soon as possible. We interviewed simon within a couple hours of brittany's death. He told me she was sick, she had flu symptoms. He was a little strange in his mannerisms. He appeared to be under the influence of something. He wouldn't sit down. He just kept pacing back and forth and was kind of stoic and kind of rambling. People will react in many different ways, from crying or just being silent. But he appeared confused. Narrator: Then simon takes issue with winter's plan of action. Winter: He had said that he did not want an autopsy, which I explained to him, "we do autopsies any time there's a death unless they can provide a religious objection or a court order," which they never did. Dimond: Why was simon so dead set against the autopsy. She's a 32-year-old woman who should be very healthy. 32-year-old women just don't drop dead at home. Narrator: Winter and police soon canvass the house for evidence. Winter: When we searched the bedroom, we found approximately 90 different prescription pill bottles in simon's name on his side. And we recovered some more prescription bottles from brittany's nightstand. There was a large quantity of prescription pills. There were so many different kinds of heavy duty drugs, things for anxiety or depression and very habit forming pain killers. These were serious drugs, not to be taken lightly. Narrator: In the wake of these discoveries, reports emerge that run counter to brittany's good girl persona. Now the media starts reporting about strange occurrences that were happening with brittany in her professional life. For instance, appearing high on the set, not remembering her lines. Things that were totally out of character and had affected her career. A friend of mine who wrote the movie "spun", which brittany murphy starred in, said, "you know, she wasn't using drugs on the set, but I know for a fact she was smoking crack with simon monjack after the fact." hammond: Her career was literally drying up by the moment. As her career declined, she's still thought she could demand the same things as she could when she was at her peak during "8 mile" days. But people were actually closing doors on her because they couldn't work with her anymore. Ebner: Her manager and her agency dumped her, and all of a sudden, the phone stopped ringing. Brittany's career was in the her career had tanked. She was only getting offers for very small, low budget b-movies... thrillers, horror films, stuff that she never dreamed she would see herself doing. Narrator: Many connect brittany's diminished career to a major change in her life. Ebner: It was no small coincidence that people started to notice her erratic behavior at the very time that she got with simon monjack. Dimond: Her friends were saying that he would control who she talked to. There were certain managers and agents he didn't allow her to speak to. He was telling her what roles to take. If you wanted to get to brittany murphy, you had to go through simon monjack. Another professional in hollywood put it more bluntly. She called him satan. Narrator: The swirling rumors soon cast brittany's death in new light. People actually started to suspect that simon monjack might have had something to do with brittany's death. Narrator: As the suspicion mounts about simon monjack's role in brittany murphy's death, his past draws new scrutiny. So while everyone's waiting for the autopsy results, people are starting to come forward with many dark truths about simon monjack. One of the people was british tv presenter simone bienne. Simone bienne was simon jack's first wife. They met in 2001. They got married in vegas. To win his first wife, simon actually told her that he owned several damien hirst paintings and he was an heir to a steel mill. He literally didn't have any of those. As soon as they got married, he moved into her property, he became a slob literally overnight. And then within a few weeks, they separated. Monjack: My family were extremely wealthy, but he didn't actually have that money. He fell in love with her. Very quickly realized that she was not for him. And I can't say it was a good thing, but it was him. Ebner: So they got a divorce, and they come to a settlement. Simon was ordered to pay $50,000 to simone. Did he pay up? No. Narrator: Skepticism surrounds even simon's most prominent credit. Simon sued the production of the movie "factory girl", claiming that they'd stolen his script to make the movie. Rather than fight him in court, they just gave him a screenwriting credit to make him go away. Simon had built his whole persona around that particular credit for "factory girl", but it's just completely bogus. He was able to create a story based on small bits of fact and then sell it further. Throughout his career, he made a lot of enemies, and people just really generally didn't like him. Monjack: I really do think that they got simon wrong. He was such an amazing story teller that he would tell the most outlandish and ludicrous stories. He was using people to write his next script. That was one of his drawbacks, is that he sometimes did actually mistake fantasy for real life. Ebner: Simon monjack was a charlatan, a con man, and an extortionist. He cut her off from the outside world. He kept her cloistered in that home. Plied her with drugs, controlled her mind. He's bad news. People actually started to suspect that he might have had something to do with brittany's death. Hammond: Simon monjack wanted a get rich quick scheme. He was a sociopath. It could be that he saw the dollar signs with brittany, and that's all he needed. Narrator: Two months after her death, brittany's toxicology report is completed. The conclusion is unexpected. The final results of brittany's autopsy was she died of pneumonia. She was anemic and had an overdose of over the counter medications. Narrator: According to winter, all three of these conditions contributed to her death. Winter: Brittany had gotten sick with flu-like symptoms for approximately a week to 10 days. A 32-year-old can die if they are sick and are just fed over-the-counter medications. And I think that's exactly what happened to brittany. Narrator: Anemia, a fairly common blood condition, further compromised to remove system. Ebner: Where did this anemia come from? It was attributed by the coroner to brittany having some unusually heavy periods. The anemia kind of blew away all her defenses and made her a risk for pneumonia. Narrator: Despite reports of prescription and illicit drug abuse, many are surprised that neither played a prominent role in brittany's demise. Winter: Brittany's death could have been prevented, in my opinion, had they taken her to the doctor or a hospital instead of just feeding her cough medicine and different non-prescription medications. The medications I think masked what the real problem was and enough that simon or sharon either didn't recognize it or just brushed it off. Why didn't he get help if she was sick? Why didn't he take her to a doctor? Brittany would be alive today. There's no question about it. Narrator: Simon's lack of decisive action invites even more media scrutiny. In an attempt to defend himself, he appears in a nationally televised interview alongside sharon murphy. He begins with his account of brittany's death. What happened that day was brittany had laryngitis. I have no idea what to do with laryngitis. I'm a rabbi, not a doctor. So I pray instead of prescribe. Dimond: Everyone is wondering why he didn't take her to a doctor. Now he's referring to himself as a rabbi. Come on. Narrator: Then host larry king raises the issue of brittany's autopsy. King: You didn't want an autopsy at first. No, I didn't. To us, it was such a shock. This pristine body that is curvy in all the right places... it's not like she was in a car accident. The skin like silk. And how could I say in front of her mother, "cut her up." I mean, it was just unfathomable. I mean, what kind of insanity is that? Dimond: You know, it's hard to think about your loved one dead, someone cutting into their body, but the way that simon described brittany's body... "her pristine body, her curvy body," it was just kind of creepy. The press seems to think we should be androids. The press seems to think that we shouldn't feel. The press doesn't understand loss. How about stories that you are a svengali, a controlling factor? A svengali? Yeah. I should be so lucky. the more this man talked, the more bizarre his personality became, the more suspicious he became. And sharon murphy strikes people as a little odd. What was going on inside that house? Narrator: Monjack's botched prime time interview fails to quell the public's doubt. Ebner: People were still wondering what the heck was up with this simon monjack character. He decided to try and head it off at the pass, and he actually invited radar magazine to come in and tour "the death house." simon is still living there. Yeah, you're the first people to ever see the infamous bathroom. You can see my wife had a penchant for cosmetics. Well, most of the cosmetics are mine 'cause I ended up having to buy them over the years for the hair and makeup. He showed the "death room," which was quite tragic and a bit terrible. This is the little doggie couch where she actually fell. She found clara's chaise lounge. And she was put her on side right here next to the chaise lounge. He's smoking a cigar while they have him on video. It smacked of this nightmare episode of "lifestyles of the rich and dead." lots of louis vuitton and lots of chanel, gucci. She had some really nice leather jackets. I never saw her wear that. Isn't that cute? It's not just disturbing. It's sick. We just had so much fun. It was just crazy. Playing the piano, and she'd be lying on the floor falling asleep. It was all that stuff. Every holiday was a balloon festival. I mean, it was just crazy. Hammond: It was a complete and utter car crash. It was in total poor taste. Monjack: It seems bizarre, doesn't it? Why did he do that? I don't know. Narrator: Suspicions surrounding simon's role in his wife's death continue to fester. But soon, his fortunes suddenly shift. Narrator: Almost five months to the day after brittany murphy perished, her mother sharon yet again dials 911. Simon is still living with his mother in law. And we find sharon trying to resuscitate him. Simon's on the bed. He's unresponsive. He's a bloated 300 pounds. She tries to attempt compressions, but it ain't working. So within 10 minutes, the paramedics arrive. The house is in complete disarray. They move him to the floor. They continue the cpr. But they can't find a pulse. At 9:45 p.M., simon monjack is pronounced dead. A mere short five months after the death of his wife. I had this awful premonition something was going to happen. I got a phone call from sharon. She said he had died. It was the most devastating moment of my life. The son that I loved, cared for, brought up... ...Grew inside of me... ...Had... was no more. Winter: We got a report that simon passed away. I responded and found it strange to be in the same house five months later. Narrator: As winter gathers information, he discovers a strange set of circumstances. Winter: We recovered some more prescription bottles from the bedroom in his name and additional names. Ebner: Some of the prescriptions were made out to some guy named trevor williams. And the others were made out to... get this... sharon monjack. Winter: During the time I was there, I interviewed sharon, and she kept saying that he died of a broken heart. And when I asked why was her prescriptions in that bedroom, she advised me that they shared the bed because they were comforting each other for the loss of brittany. They comforted each other by sleeping in the same bed. Narrator: In subsequent media appearances, sharon denies the sharon monjack bottles exist or that she ever slept in the same bed as her former son in law. Hammond: I think simon and sharon murphy were definitely sharing a bed. Why would you move your belongings from your own bedroom, which you had for many years into brittany's husband's bedroom. I believe that simon and sharon was definitely doing the dirty. Monjack: I can absolutely, 100% refute that because I was speaking to him daily, and it wasn't like that. He loved beautiful women, young and beautiful women. And every woman he'd been with was young and beautiful. So I rest my case. Narrator: On July 22, 2010, the coroner announces his findings. Simon's health was not the best. He probably abused his body too much. Ebner: The coroner concludes that the cause of death was acute pneumonia and anemia, just like brittany. How is it that these two individuals, husband and wife, one is 300 pounds, the other is 115 pounds, how is it that they both succumbed to the exact same ailments? The media is scratching their heads. Woman: Very eerie because the circumstances are so similar. A surprising death. Everyone is shocked about this. So you have two people in one house who die five months apart, exactly the same causes. I mean, how much more weird could this be? Narrator: The bizarre series of deaths fuels the skepticism of one man in particular. Angelo bertolotti has refused to accept the cause of brittany's death being accidental. He suspects foul play. Narrator: To help him find the truth, angelo seeks the help of a renowned expert. Wecht: I'm dr. Cyril h. Wecht. I'm a forensic pathologist and medical and legal consultant. The official results in brittany murphy's case would be quite legitimate causes of death, although rather rare for somebody of that age, especially someone who is affluent and not living in a tent in the middle of a park somewhere. It's absolutely unfathomable how this happened to a hollywood star. Mr. Bertolotti had a lot of questions which he felt were not being properly addressed by the los angeles county medical examiner's office. Angelo gets some extensive research done on the cause of brittany's death, pneumonia, but especially anemia, and he discovered that some people who died of acute anemia, one of the causes of brittany's death, were actually found to have died of arsenic poisoning. That's a pretty important fact to keep in mind for a medical examiner while they perform an autopsy. Angelo also discovers that the I.A. Coroner's office never tested brittany's hair for toxic substances. So he petitions to get a sample of her hair so he can send it to an independent lab. There's a lot of legal squabbling back and forth, but he finally gets it. Wecht: He submitted it to a laboratory in colorado, and he obtained the results. He sent that to me for my perusal and analysis. Narrator: And what dr. Wecht discovers is nothing short of stunning. Wecht: The results from the colorado toxicology laboratory were very surprising... off the chart. Narrator: After the mysterious death of brittany murphy, her father, angelo bertolotti, commissions an independent examination. He believes his daughter fell victim to foul play. Wecht: Mr. Bertolotti obtained a strand of brittany's hair. He submitted it to a laboratory in colorado, and he obtained the results. He sent that to me for my perusal and analysis. The results were very surprising, and they speak for themselves. They show 10 heavy metals at significant levels, that several instances are well beyond the levels permissible by the world health organization. I have never seen anything like this and never seen it reported in any other case. Ebner: The effects of heavy metals are dizziness, sweating, cramps, coughing, lethargy, all of which brittany had suffered from leading up to her death. Narrator: The results leave wecht with vexing questions. Wecht: We do not know if these compounds made their way into her system. You're looking for things which have been ingested and which have then grown out in the hair. They were not reported in the blood by the los angeles county medical examiner's office. Garcia: These findings raise a lot of questions. What exactly was going on in that house? He suspected that his daughter had indeed been poisoned. Wecht: People had been poisoned, usually with arsenic, and you can find other cases involving heavy metals such as lead and bismuth and cadmium and so on. Narrator: Dr. Wecht and angelo attempt to commission further tests on brittany's remains, but they run into a problem. Wecht: Mr. Bertolotti did seek to have the body exhumed, but the legal authority was in the hands of brittany murphy's mother, and when she was asked about it, she denied the right to have it done. Dimond: Sharon murphy says, "absolutely not" to exhuming her daughter's body, and this strikes some people as awfully odd. Why wouldn't a mother want to know the exact cause of her daughter's death? Narrator: Angelo believes there's a simple explanation for sharon's obfuscation. I'm quite sure brittany was poisoned, yeah. Poisoned by her own mother, yes. That's what I think. So angelo actually believes that sharon poisoned her daughter and then in turn poisoned simon in order to cover her tracks. Hammond: Sharon's a cancer survivor. The person more prone to actually getting pneumonia and kicking her clogs would be sharon, but she's still alive. Why didn't sharon catch it? Narrator: Angelo points to brittany and simon's plans for the future as a possible motive. Monjack: Simon loved new york. From what simon was saying to me, he wanted to move there. But sharon was the third person in the marriage, and he wanted to move without sharon. Ebner: Brittany and simon were going to start a new life, perhaps have a child. Sharon is about to be discarded. Angelo became suspicious because sharon is not the type of person that would take that lying down. Narrator: But the matriarch strenuously pushes back. Ebner: Sharon denies all claims that she may have had anything to do with her daughter's death. Instead, she turns it on angelo and says, "listen, this guy's just after his daughter's money, and that's it." narrator: Sharon even pens an open letter attacking the hair testing as woefully inadequate and dismissing her ex-husband's claims as fraudulent. Years later, after exploring several avenues, angelo finds he can no longer persist. By 2017, angelo bertolotti, "a", his own health is failing him and, "b", sharon's refusing to cooperate. And he just decides to back off. Narrator: Despite angelo's retreat, to many, brittany's death is still an open question. Wecht: I believe that brittany murphy's death remains a significant mystery, and I regret very much that it's not going to be clarified in any meaningful way in the years ahead. It's just too late now to deal with the body. It's undergone extensive decomposition and contamination from soil, et cetera. But I have seen the autopsy on simon monjack, and there's no question that, in my opinion, he died from natural diseases. Narrator: Los angeles county, however, rejects the notion brittany was poisoned and stands by its final report. Winter: During the autopsy, we did do tissue and blood and urine. We felt that was sufficient. We didn't find any metals in her system at all. I'm 100% sure that she wasn't murdered. From the information that we have received, the case is closed. Ebner: The question remains, what really happened? The death, in my mind, may have been accidental, but it sure as hell could have been prevented. And for that, I personally hold simon monjack accountable. But the fact is we have lost a wonderful, wonderful talent in brittany murphy. May she rest in peace. Monjack: She has an ability and a grace that only the very best of actresses manage to bring forth. She knew how to please an audience. She knew how to be somebody else. She had the abilities to be one of the greats.
