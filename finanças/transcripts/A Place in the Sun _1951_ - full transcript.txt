You want a ride? Is this the place? Yeah. - Yes? - T'd like to see Mr. Charles eastman. So would I. I expect to if I work another five years. Could you tell me how to get to his office? Go to go to the administration building. Just a moment. - Mr. eastman? - Yes. I'm sorry. Our Mr. eastman is at home today. He won't be coming in. He won't? - Tell me, are you a relative? - He's my uncle. I'm sure he'll want to see you. Let me give him a ring. Yes, one moment, please. Paris can dictate to women what to wear at a cocktail party or to bed. The bridge game. Paris is not going to tell American women what bathing suits to wear. - Miss ottinger. - Hello. Who? Yes, of course. All right, margarette, let me have a word with the young man. - Thank you. - It's on number two. - Hello. - Hello, my boy. - I hope you remember, sir. - Of course I remember. How are you? You certainly got here fast. Well, I wanted to. But I certainly didn't want to bother you at home, sir. Tell you what you do, you drop by to the house, about seven o'clock. - Yes, sir. - See you then. Thank you very much, sir. What's the matter, dad? My tie on crooked? No, it's just that I was thinking... - George eastman's dropping in tonight. - George eastman? You mean Asa's son? That's right. I ran into him in Chicago. Is he going to lead us in a prayer? He's not at all like Asa or his wife. He's very quiet and pleasant. Not much education, but ambitious. And he looks amazingly like Earl. - What's he do? - He's a bellhop in my hotel. Oh, fine. I always wanted to look like a bellhop. Charles, why do yo have to bring him on here? There's always a place for a boy like that. - What do we do about him socially? - That's easy, we can all leave town. You don't have to take him up socially. He just wants to work, get ahead, that's all. - A young man, by the name eastman. - Show him in, William. Charles, sometimes I think you're in your second childhood. - Good evening, sir. - Hi, George. This is my wife. My daughter, marcia. My son, Earl. George eastman. Sit down, George. - Like a cocktail, a drink? - No, thank you. My husband says he met you in Chicago that you were working at a hotel there. - Yes, that's right. - You must have left very suddenly. Well... you see, I quit my job. Mr. eastman was good enough to say that if I came through here, perhaps he might be able to find some place for me at the mill. I think we can work something out along that line. - What do you think, Earl? - Have you ever done any bookkeeping? - Typewriting? Stenography? - No. You see Earl at the plant in the morning. Thank you, sir. That's very kind of you. And your mother? I trust she's well. We've never met, you know, but I've heard her mentioned from time to time. She wrote Charles a moving letter at the time of your father's death. Is she still active in her religious work? - Yes, ma am, she is. - Church work? Not exactly. It's more like social work. It's a mission. Like the salvation army? No, it's not like the salvation army. - It's more... - More intimate, maybe? Did I hear you say intimate, darling? - You're late, vickers. - Of course, I'm always late. It's part of my charm. Good evening, Mr. eastman, Mrs. eastman. You know Tom tipton, don't you? - Hello. - Don't drink. We haven't got time. - Thanks. - Well, I'm ready. - I'm ready too. - Men are so disgustingly prompt. They do it to put us women in a bad light, don't you think so? I hear your place at the lake is coming along fine. Oh, did Marsha tell you? It's a dream palace. I'm gonna end my days there. - Will it be ready for summer? - Even if I have to whip everyone. All right, Simone legree. Let's go. - Goodnight, eastman. - Good night. - Bye-bye! - Bye. Have you made any arrangements to stay in town? If you haven't, I can recommend a quiet little rooming house. - My former secretary used to stay there. - Thanks. I found a place this afternoon. Well, that was fortunate, wasn't it? I'm sorry we aren't going to be home for dinner, but some other time perhaps. Yes, my boy. You see Earl in the morning. Good night. - Good night, sir. Good night. - Good night. Charles eastman! You've got to be aware, whatever your job is, that you're an eastman. And youre expected to act accordingly. - I understand that. - I hope so. We'll go through here. Oh, another thing as you probably noticed, nine out of ten eastman employees are women. There's a company rule against us mixing socially with the girls who work here. My father asked me to particularly call this to your attention. That is a must. Mrs. Harper, this is George eastman. Take George along to Mr. whiting, please. Yes, sir. Mrs kovak, this is George eastman. - He's gonna work here for a while. - Okay. This is it. Now you're in business. - Oh, Angela. - Hello. Hi, Angela. This room could be your study. There's even an old cupboard for your books. Whatever else is in it, it isn't books! - Who lived here? - Probably a pirate in search of his soul. You think he found it? Don't believe I know. - Vicky... - What? Could we be happy here, never seeing anyone again? - Small world. - That's what you think. Put your arms around me. Imagine the sea at night. Who's your friend? Our faces close together. Hold me, ray. When I feel you close, all our lies come true. Nothing can ever spoil them again. You know what the girls would say if they saw me walking along like this with you? They'd say I was making up to the boss's nephew. That's silly. I'm in the same boat as the rest of you. If you're an eastman you're not in the same boat with anyone. - I work along with you, don't I? - Oh, sure. Pretty soon they'll move you to a better job, and you'll find yourself in the front office. That's the last we'll see of Mr. George eastman. Who says that? Everybody. Everybody knows they put you in with us to learn the business. I wouldn't be too sure of that. Lord's divine command, when you find a brother struggling, lend a willing, helping hand. Bear ye one another's burdens - You lonely all the time? - Not on weekdays. How come? Well, remember I put swimsuits in boxes six days a week? Yeah. What about Sundays? Maybe then you put yourself in a swimsuit. Not me. Why? You don't look good in a swimsuit? - Sure I do. I can't swim. - You're kidding. I never learned. I was even scared of the duck pond when I was a kid. We lived on a farm, a small one. How come you came here? We were poor. We needed the money. I came down here and got a job. - I'm glad. - Me, too. This is it, where I live. - It's 443372, elm Avenue. - I'll walk you to the door. I can manage from here. I have my own private entrance. Good night. My landlady is fierce. I've wanted to do that for so long. I did, too. Will we see each other again, like this? - If you want. - When? It's up to you. You gotta be careful. I'd better go in now. Don't go. Please don't go. Good night. - I was looking over at you today. - I was looking over at you. Not as much as usually. - I was thinking about my plan. - Don't we work fast enough as it is? - Hi, beautiful. - Hello, Angela. George, I'm glad you're still in the packaging room. Not just for my sake, honest. It's better for you than running around with those eastman and their bunch and all those rich girls with nothing to do. Listen, I've only been out to their house once since I got here. It's funny, I used to think you went there every night. Don't be silly, honey. George, remember when I said if you're an eastman, you're not in the same boat with anybody?" Yean. I take it back. Come on, let's find a quieter place. You don't know any other place we can go, do you? Well, there's a soda fountain on the edge of town where all the high school kids go. They re noisy. I don't care as long as I'm with you. - What are you doing here? - Talking. Look here, boy, they've invented the house it's a very good place to talk in. You'd better get back to yours. Come on. Come on. - Good night. - Come on. Gee, I wish I could ask you in, but Mrs. Roberts is so strict. I don't want to make things difficult for you. Gee, I wish I could ask you in, but we'd have to keep the music awful low. This is nice. Mrs. Roberts is right next door. This is the way it should have been. This is the way... Oh, George. George. - Good morning. - Good morning. Who's that? Is that George? - Yeah, that's George. - What have you got him doing here? It was the only place to put him without firing somebody. This is no place for the boy. - How's he getting along, gladay? - Fine. Don't think it'd hurt to give that boy a little position well, George. I suppose you thought I'd forgotten all about you. No, sir. You may not know it, but I've been keeping an eye on you. - That's very good of you, sir. - Getting along all right? - I know the work pretty well now, sir. - Yes, I suppose you do. Do you know it well enough to take on responsibility? - Yes, sir. - Good. I'm going to move you up. Thank you, sir. I appreciate it. You've earned it. Sir, I was wondering, did... Have you by any chance seen the production report I submitted? I'll tell you what, George, Mrs. eastman is having a party at the house on the 15th of next month. And we'd like to have you drop in. - Thank you, sir. I'd love to come. - Good. Then you and I can have a nice little talk. Next month on the 15th? That's your birthday. I was planning on our little party. Sure, honey. I'll just be over at the old man's for a little while, pay my respects. Then I'll be over. You better be! - Hello, darling! - Nice to see you again. Hello, there. Later. - Hello. - Hello. - I see you had a misspent youth. - Yes, it was. Why all alone? Being exclusive? Being dramatic? Being blue? I'm just fooling around. Maybe you'd like to play. No, I'll just watch you. Go ahead. Do I make you nervous? Yes. You look like an eastman. Are you one of them? Mm-hmm. I'm a nephew. My name's George. - I'm Angela. - Vickers. - I saw you here last spring. - I don't remember seeing you before. No. You've been away, haven't you? You took a trip with your parents. - How did you know? - I read about you in the papers. - What else do you do? - The usual things. You look unusual. That's the first time anybody ever said that. You keep pretty much to yourself, don't you? Yes, sometimes. Blue... or exclusive? - Neither, right now. - Here you are, George. Well, Angela. I was thinking how's your mother, how is she? Fine, last time I heara. Have you written to her about your promotion? I kicked him up a notch the other day. Smart boy. No, sir, I was gonna write her in a day or two. Never neglect your mother, my boy. You're gonna telephone to her right away. Tell her the good news. You can use the phone over here, at the bar. Ong distance? What's the number, George? Just a minute. I don't know. Hello. I want to place a call to the bethel independent mission in Kansas City. - The bethel mission. - Hello, mama. George! God bless you, my son. Are you sick? No, mama, I'm not sick. Are you're coming home? Listen, mama. 1 got a promotion. Yeah, I can send you money every month now. Happy birthday. Today's your birthday and I've prayed for you. I've been praying you'll come home soon and carry on your father's work. I'm keeping your room for you, George, just as you left it, like I always do. I'm getting on pretty well here, mama. I'm happy here, too. - Who's there with you, George? - It's me, mama! - Who was that? - Just a girl, mama. No, mama. I don't... mama, I just met her! Yes, mama. I will, mama. I know you'll be a good son. I promise. - Goodbye, my son. - Goodbye, mama. Did you promise to be a good boy? Not to waste your time on girls? - I don't waste my time. - Will she let you go out tonight? Will she let you go dancing? Come on. I'll take you dancing... On your birthday, blue boy. Gee, al, isnt it the limit? The party just broke up a few minutes ago. I'm sorry, honey. I couldn't get away for three hours. Four hours. You must have paid him an awful lot of respects. I think he's really gonna do things for me, honey. He said, "I got my eye on you." I think he really means it, too. That's fine. But you could have phoned me. - Yeah, I know, I could have phoned. - Never mind. Presents waiting for you on your plate. - Happy birthday. - Thanks. Hey, that's wonderful. Boy, I can sure use that on my new job, huh? Were there many young people there tonight? - A few. Why? - Oh, it's melted. Was your cousin marcia there? All those other pretty girls you read about in the papers? Some of them were, yes. They're not all pretty. - Was Angela vickers? - What? Pretty. Did you like her very much? I liked her some. Sure, she's a pretty girl. - She wears nice clothes. - Why shouldn't she, with all that money? Honey, why do you have to keep needling me all the time? I can't help it. I still don't see why couldn't tell them you had an appointment? You know I can't tell them about you. You understand the fix we're in. Yeah, I know. If my family ever found out about us, we'd both be out of a job. George, maybe you don't want to see me so much any more. Is that it? Or maybe you don't wanna see me at all. - Now you're head of the department. - You know I didn't say that. Honey, don't cry. Look, you dance just as pretty as anybody. You look just as pretty. S50, come on, stop crying, will you? George, it's awful. I can't tell you. - What is it? - I'm so afraid. Honey, what's the matter? George... we're in trouble. Real trouble, I think. How do you mean? Remember the first night... You came here? I'm so worried. Hello, al. It's me. How do you feel? Just the same, hun? No, I haven't found the name of any doctor yet. Yes, I will. Don't you worry. Everything's gonna turn out all right. Yean. Yeah, first thing. Good night. Hello? Speaking. Who? Oh, hello. Yes, of course I remember you. I just didn't recognize your voice at first. Friday night? Yeah. I think I can. No, I'd like to. Yes. Where? All right. I'll meet you there. Yeah. Goodbye, miss vickers. Huh? Goodbye, Angela. - A penny. - For what? For your thoughts. Highest prices paid. I was just wondering why you invited me tonight. Because of my reasons. - Good evening, miss vickers. - Good evening. Good evening, mr eastman. Good evening. - Angela, darling, hello. - Hello, marcia. - Hello, George. Having fun? - I just got here. Well, come on in and join the party. It's going to be such a wonderful summer. - Do you ride? - I'm just taking it up. Hello, mother, dad. We keep several horses. There'll be lots of parties and dances and things like that. And who, may I ask, is he? If she weren't my daughter, I should feel inclined to ask her the same question. Aren't you happy with me? Happy? The trouble is I'm too happy tonight. You seem so strange, so deep and far away. As though you were holding something back. - I am. - Don't. I'd better. This is nice. I don't want to spoil it. You'd better tell me. I love you. I've loved you since the first moment I saw you. I guess maybe I even loved you before I saw you. And youre the fellow that wondered why I invited you here tonight. [ Tell you why. I love... Are they watching us? I love you, too! It scares me. - But it is a wonderful feeling. - It's wonderful when you're here. I can hold you, I can see you. I can hold you next to me. But what's it going to be like next week? All summer long? I'll still be as much in love with you. You'll be gone. It's so beautiful there. You must come. I know my parents will be a problem. But you can come the weekends when the kids from school are there. You don't have to work weekends, that's the best time. If you don't come, I'll drive down here to see you. I'll pick you up outside the factory. You'll be my pick-up. We'll arrange it somehow. Whatever way we can. We'll have such wonderful times together, just the two of us. - I'd be the happiest person in the world. - The second happiest. Angela, if I could only tell you how much I love you. - If I could only tell you all. - Tell mama. Tell mama all. - Your age, Mrs. Hamilton? - Twenty-two. How long married? Three months. Well, now... sit down. What seems to be the trouble, Mrs. Hamilton? You heedn't be afraid to tell me. That's my business, listening to other people's troubles. Well... It's like this. My husband hasn't much money. I have to work to help pay the expenses. Yes? When I found out I was going to have a baby... We didn't see... We didn't know any doctors. What business is your husband in, Mrs. Hamilton? Electrician. Well now, that's not such a bad business. At least they charge enough! We can't afford to... “There are free hospitals, you know? I know. Free hospitals don't solve everything. Tell me... how did you happen to come to me, anyhow? I heard people say you were a good doctor. I see, Mrs. Hamilton, when you went to the altar three months ago, you must have realized you might have to face a situation like this. Well now, once you make up your mind to face this bravely, you'll find all these problems have a way of sorting themselves out. Medical bills, clothes. I know. I know my wife and I worried at first. - But now we can look back... - It's not like that! I'm not married. I haven't got a husband. All right, that won't do any good. - Where's the young man? - He deserted me. What'll I do? Somebody's gotta help me. Miss Hamilton, my advice is go home and see your parents and tell them. It'll be much better that way, I assure you. So if you'll come to place yourself under my care during your pregnancy, I'll do everything to ensure vour health and that of your child. On the other hand, if you've just come for free advice on... material and financial problems... With which I can't help you... No, I can not help you. What did he say? He said he thought I ought to make a very healthy mother. Gee, al. George, that's all you've been saying to me for weeks. I'm trying to think. You just gotta marry me. Family or no family. This future of yours or no future. Just looking at it that way settles everything. But we haven't got any money. This thing comes out, I'm through. I won't even have the job I got now. - You re just stalling. - I'm not. I'm trying to think of... I want to figure out some way, maybe. I was thinking maybe when I get my vacation, first week of September. All right, that's when we'll do it. When you get your vacation, we'll go someplace way out of town and get married. - You understand? - Yeah, I understand. And now back again to the news. Well, it seems the fine weather we've been having here has been just a little too fine in other parts of the country. In New York City, seven persons are reported as having succumbed over the weekend from the high temperature still prevailing. Meanwhile, nearer home, fine weather had its darker aspects, too. State highway patrol reports fatalities from traffic and weekend accidents exceeded by four the figure for the corresponding weekend last summer. Some 14 persons lost their lives. Among these, at least five were drowned. Several others received emergency first aid at crowded lake resorts. So be careful. Remember it may be your turn next or the turn of those nearest and dearest to you. Drive carefully, and if you aren't a good swimmer don't swim from unpatrolled beaches. Make your holiday death's holigay, too. George. Hello, you. - I've missed you so! - Me, too. I can't tell you how much. I've the most wonderful news. So wonderful I had to drive all the way down to tell you. Mother and dad want you to spend your vacation with us up at the lake. - You'll come, won't you? - I don't think I can. George, no. Look, this is my one chance to show you off to mother and dad. Take my word for it, I've got to. I promised my uncle I'd spend some time with him during my vacation. That's perfect your aunt and uncle are both coming up on 3rd September. That's when you're coming. Darling, I love you so much, so very much. Just think of it. We'll go swimming together, lie in the sun together, go horseback riding through the pine woods. I'll make breakfast for you every morning, and you can sleep late. I'll bring it in to you in your room. - And you love me. - Yes. Hello? Listen, al, I've gotta ask you a favor. Now look, don't get angry at me. I've gotta ask you for an extra week. - I don't have to give you anything. - You just got to, al. See the thing is, I just talked to my uncle he wants me to come up there, up to the brides lake and spend the first week of my vacation up there with them. - It's important to both of us. - Why is it important to us? I figure from the way he's been talking that if I go up there he's gonna give me a bonus. Might be a lot of money, I don't know, two-three hundred dollars. We could sure use that. All right, you go up there for a week. I'll wait here. I want to talk to you about that, Ann. I'm not sure I approve of young Mr. eastman. I certainly don't know what he's doing here. I do, Tony. He's here because I invited him. Would you mind telling me why do you encourage this? Tony, you can be very unperceptive at times. Opposition only makes a boy of that type appear more attractive. I invited him, because I wanted to see him sit down 24 hours a day among people Angela really knows. She'll see whether he belongs or not. Come on! It's freezing in here! It's just like ice! Hurry up! I've never been so cold in my life! - Aren't you going in? - Sure. George, put me down! It happens every time, every single time what does? I freeze to death. It's the coldest I've ever known. - What did you go in for, then? - 'Cause it's my lake. - Yours? - Uh-huh. I found this trail when I was 14. Nobody lives here, you know? At least not on this part of it. It's in two parts with a little channel in between. There's a crumbly old lodge down at the end of the other part and some crumbly old boats. Come closer. - What do they call this lake? - Loon lake. It's nice now. But sometimes it's weirq, especially at sundown. I've never been able to feel the same about it since the drowning. - What drowning? - A man and a girl last summer. Nobody knows exactly what happened. I guess their boat capsized. It was five days before they found the girls body. - And the man? - They never found him. - What was that? - A loon. George, what are you thinking about? Nothing. Nothing at all. And I used to think I was complicated. - Are you worried about my family? - I suppose I am. Don't. I've known them intimately for several years, and they're quite nice. Perhaps they are a little unused to you, but that'll come in time. Suppose it doesn't? I'd go anywhere with you. You really mean that? You'd marry me? Haven't I told you? I intend to. Every time I've had a millstone named eastman round my neck. - I know just how you feel, Tony. - Speak for yourself. What's golf got that a 20 mile hike hasn't? Dad says it's a spirit of competition. I've hardly exchanged five words with your elusive nephew of yours. Pity, I'm told he can be very charming. Anyway I put him on my right tonight so he won't run away. My boy, I want you to know I'm proud of the way you've been getting on. I've wanted to justify your confidence in me. A man who can meet people, that's an asset we can use upfront. I've been thinking about a place for you, up there with us. Administration perhaps. Where I can keep an eye on you myself. Lony? Yes? Maybe we ought to take George along with us tomorrow. - There are few people I'd like him... - Oh, no, you don't. There's the labor day ski race tomorrow and George is my pilot. - Well, which Mr. eastman? - Mr. George eastman. - Call for you, George. - For me? You'd better bend an ear, Angela, it's a woman. Hello? - Yes. - I'm here at the bus station. You lied to me, George, for the last time. Now I want you to come and get me. - It's not gonna be too easy right now. - Now! - I'll do it tomorrow morning? - I said now! If you're not here in half an hour, I'll come where you are. I'll tell them everything, George. I mean it. Yes. I'll leave right away. Let's not go to floriaa this winter. Let's stay right here. It was a friend of my mother's. She's not well. - I hope it's not serious. - T don't know. I ought to get home. I ought to try and get a plane tonight if I can. If it's not serious, do come back. We'll be expecting you. I will, thank you. - If you'll excuse me, I'll go pack. - Certainly. Goodbye, George. Goodbye, George. George, how long will you be gone? I don't know, darling. I just don't know. You will come back to me, won't you? As soon as you can? - As soon as 1 can. - You promise? I promise. Are you crazy, coming up here? Phoning me like that with my whole family listening in? You weren't even staying with your family. You were staying with Angela vickers. George, I'm through waiting for you. You're gonna marry me tomorrow, or I'll telephone the newspapers and tell 'em everything, then I'll kill myself! Don't talk like that. You make me talk like that. We'll go to Warsaw in the morning and get married. Let's get out of here. I won't get out of here until you say you will. That you're gonna do it! All right. Come on. Labor day. It's a holiday. Al? Look, al. Look, al, it's not my fault. Besides, one day more is not gonna make any difference. There's a wonderful lake near here, loon lake, just the kind of place you've always wanted to go for a honeymoon. We could go up there. Hey, there's a lodge on it, too. If you like, we could spend the day there, and tomorrow we can come back here. - Al, are you listening? - Yeah, I'm listening. Tell you what, let's make a holiday of it. Everybody else is. Why don't we get some sandwiches and lets have a picnic on the lake? - How's that? - That sounds pretty good. Look, al, let's not quarrel any more. Let's try and make the best of it, huh? All right, let's make the best of it. I should have stopped at that last station. Yep, bone dry. - Stupid! - Is the lodge very far from here? No, it's only just around the bend. Tell you what, why don't we take our lunch and go down to the landing? We can rent a boat and have our picnic now. I can pick up the gas later and come back for the car. - How does it sound? - It sounds wonderful! It is beautiful! Yeah. - How much to rent a boat? - 25 cents an hour, $2 all day. Are there many people out on the lake today? Got it all to yourself. - Are you people at the lodge? - Yeah. That is, we will be tonight. - Probably spend a couple of days there. - You'll have to sign for it. Sure. Thanks a lot, - that's funny. - What? I know another guy named Gilbert Edwards. Lives over at westbrook. Pretty common name. Only two times I ever heard. - This boat doesn't leak, does it? - I don't rent leaky boats. Don't worry, my husband's a very good swimmer. It's so lonely here. It's like we were the only two people left in the whole world. Maybe we are. Maybe when we get back to shore, everybody will have disappeared. I'd like that, wouldn't you? Then we could go anywhere we wanted. We could live in the biggest house in the world. Only I'd like to live in a little house, just big enough for the two of us. Only there's gonna be more than two of us, isn't there? What's the matter, George? You 100k sick. Nothing. Well, I'm out of breath. I'm not used to rowing. Rest for a while, dear. We can just drift. After all, we're not going anywhere. Look behind you. "Star light, star bright, first star I see tonight "wish me luck, wish me light, make my wish come true tonight." Did you make a wish? What did you wish? Nothing. Afraid it won't come true if you tell? Al, I'm sorry that I've been so... hasty to you. I didn't mean it. It's just things happen, and you just don't stay the same. I will make it up to you. I'll stick by you. I do love you, George. We ought to get back. It's getting dark. That old man ll think we drowned. But let's drift for a while, huh? I'm not afraid of the dark. It's so nice. I'll tell you what I wished. I wished that you loved me again. You'll see, we'll make a go of it if we give ourselves the chance. We'll go to another town where nobody knows us. And we'll get jobs, maybe together. We'll do things together and go out together just like any other old married couple. George, you'll see. After a while, you'll settle down and you'll be happy and content with what you've got, instead of working yourself up all the time over things you can't have. After all, it's the little things in life that count. Sure, maybe we'll have to scrimp and save, but we'll have each other. - I'm not afraid of being poor. - Stop it, al! - Why? What's the matter? - Just stop it! George? What did you think of when you saw the star? You wished that you weren't here with me, didn't you? You wished I was some place else where you'd never have to see me again. Maybe you wished that I was dead. Is that it? Do you wish that I was dead? No, I didn't! Just leave me alone. Poor George. I know it isn't easy for you. I shouldn't have said that. Stay where you are. Who's there? I'm trying to find the road. I was hiking, got lost. You know where the road is? Yeah, it's down the trail about a quarter of a mile. Quiet, boy, quiet. Now stay there. - Good morning, Mr. marlowe. - Good morning, mack. It's for you. The coroner. Yes, doctor? On? Just wait a minute, will you? Bob, get these facts. All right now. Yes. Young couple drowned. Give me all the facts. - Miss vickers around? - No, she isn't. I think she's out playing tennis. Thank you. Mr. eastman? - Do you feel well? - Yeah, fine. Hello, George. It's been centuries. - Maid said you were out playing tennis. - No, I was watching them. I haven't eaten anything since you've been away. Well, hardly anything. Don't go away again, George. Here, come and sit with me. How is your mother? She's much better. It wasn't as serious as they thought. I'm glad of that. You look very tired. I didn't get much sleep. I was even a little airsick on the plane. Poor George. Anyway, I've got good news. Mother and dad are beginning to melt. You're winning them over with your boyish charm. Maybe they'll let us make our announcement when I come home from school at Christmas. At Christmas? Let's run away. - Run away? - Run away now. - Right now. - But, darling, we don't have to. Not the way things are going now. Mother will want a big wedding. I've always dreamed of having one too. As long as I can remember. All girls do. Here now, don't start getting moody again. Come on, you change and I'll meet you on the terrace. - Find any identification on the girl? - Yeah, this employment card. From the eastman industries. Alice Tripp or something. You said the man gave his name as Gilbert Edwards? Yean. You can drag that lake until you're blue in the face, you won't find him. - How do you figure that, bear bait? - Well, I figure he left here in an auto. When I went up to my cabin last night, around supper time, there was a little old coupe parked in the woods up there a peace. At about nine o'clock, somebody started up that auto and drove off awfully fast. - Hello, George. - Well, hello. - Hi, George. - Hello. Hey, George, where you been? Got another woman stashed around someplace? - You've been gone so long. - Can't we be alone somewhere? - We could take the speedboat. - Yeah, come on. So they wanna be alone. Well, we can't have that. Come on, Joan, come on you lazy bones. Go! Hey, Angela, how about some company? Come on, everybody, get in! - What about us? - There's no room for you. We'll fix that. District attorney frank marlowe's officers to investigate further. Less than an hour ago, the coroner informed the press that although the girl's death was caused by drowning, bruises would indicate that a struggle took place. The district attorney meanwhile is believed to have evidence that the girl's male companion may still be alive. Three boy scouts have reported that a young man, visibly upset... You look tired, George. - That's what I told him. - Why don't you go inside and take a rest. Maybe that's a good idea. Excuse me, won't you? Earl, any more news on the drowning over at loon? Looks like the papers are trying make it into a murder case. The fellows still alive, he's drowned her. Frances, you read too many mysteries. She was probably a chatterbox, like Frances and he picked her up and threw her overboard! I've been looking for you, sir. Mr. vickers would like to see you alone. He's in the living room, sir. Sit down, will you? I thought that you and I might have a little chat before dinner. Care for a drink? I'm gonna make it a double. I'm gonna be a little bit personal. It's about you and Angela and this talk about your getting married. Right now I don't know whether I'm for you or against you. I don't know you well enough. I know how you feel, Mr. vickers. Who am I to think of marrying Angela? Angela has everything. Talk of marriage aside, fact is we know almost nothing about your background. There's not much to know. What there is, I've wanted to tell you myself. My family is... We were very poor people. My family devoted their lives to a kind of religious work. Conducting sidewalk services... Street singing. I was part of all that, until the law came along and said I ought to go to school. I only went to school till I was 13 years old. We didn't ever have any money for anything, so I left home. I was gonna do something about it. I took any kind of job I could get. Busboy, elevator operator, caddie. I had no training, no education. Then I came here, went to work for my uncle. That's my background, Mr. vickers. There's nothing very much there to recommend any approval. But I love Angela more than anything in the world. I'd do anything to make her happy. Even if it's right that I shouldn't see her any more. Easy, boy. Forthrightness is a prime virtue. Let me tell you, I admire your frankness. I should apologies for eavesdropping, but I'm glad I listened. Well, dad, does that answer all your questions? All I ask is that you two don't do anything hasty. - Let"s get out somewhere. - We'll go for a drive. I just wanna be alone with you. That's all I want. Let's go. I just can't believe it. That this horrible thing could happen to Alice. - She was such a sweet, quiet girl. - Ever meet any of her boyfriends? There was a young man who took her out once in a while dut he hasn't been around in a few weeks. And who was he? It's a small town, Mr. Kelly and any scandal would hurt my business something awful. Lady, there will be a scandal if you don't cooperate. Well, I never met him, mind you, but the girls said he was an eastman. But it couldn't be. Not one of the eastman's. Hello, give me the district attorney's office in Warsaw. Here we go. Look, he's gaining. Safe. Safe and sound. Calling car 41. Calling car 41. Man believed in your vicinity... - The third time this summer, Ms. vickers. - I can't understand it. Height 5°10", hair dark, complexion fair, build light. - What's your name? - George eastman. Look, Ms. vickers, I'd hate to some day be picking up the pieces of a pretty girl like you. - Lets take it easy, will you? - Anything you say. I just love that officer. He's so blood-curdling. And he writes such a nice hand. Darling, what is it? I'm tired. Very tired. Yes, you must be. Darling, let's never leave this place. Let's just stay here alone. Don't let father upset you. I'm the one who counts. You're the only one. The only one. People are gonna say things, I know. Things about me. About me, I know. - It's gonna make you stop loving me. - Hush. Don't talk like that. - I was asleep. - You were dreaming. You were talking. You said, "not my fault.” Then you said something I couldn't make out. Then you said, "Angela, don't hate me." That was a bad dream, George, a false dream, because I'll always love you. We'd better go now. Mother's liable to send out a posse for us. You go in. I'll be along in a minute. Every time you leave me for a minute, it's like goodbye. I like to believe it means you can't live without me. Is your name George eastman? Yes. - You re under arrest. - Why? What for? Start walking back down the road there, bub, and you'll find out. Go on, get going. And no monkey business, either. That's him all right. Mr. marlowe, here's your baby. Youre George eastman? I suppose you know what you're charged with? No. I suppose you don't know anything about the murder of Alice Tripp? - I'm not guilty. - Come on, son, we've evidence. - You're not going to deny it, are you? - Yes, I deny it. In that case we'll take you to the vickers' house and see what your friends have to say about you. Please don't take me back there. I'll tell you all I can. Don't take me back there. I didn't intend to, son. I just wanted to see what you'd have to say. Take him to Warsaw, boys, and lock him up. We'll go to the vickers place and see what they have to say about him. Say he's a relative, came to the house once. Got that? Once. And have Hollister take his name off. You had no inkling of his relations with that girl? No. And none of you knew this boy was leading a double life? No. Mr. marlowe, if youve no further questions for my daughter and me... Will you excuse us? Of course. Mr. vickers, I have no desire to harass an innocent person. I'd like to keep your daughter name free of scandal, put if the papers get hold of her... I'll keep her name out of the papers. You keep her out of the trial. That may not be possible. The defense would have to agree to it. The defense will agree to it. I'll see to that. I'll engage the boy's lawyers. If it appears he's innocent, I'll spend $100,000 to defend him. - And if he's guilty? - If he is guilty... I won't spend a single cent to save him from the electric chair. Thank you, mother. Thank you, Lulu. The boy's tired. I think that's enough for today. I guess youre right. Mr. bellows... Has there been any word from... From miss vickers? No, George. You see when Mr. eastman engaged us to defend you, we made an agreement with the district attorney not to drag miss vickers into the case unnecessarily. Her appearance on the stand would be irrelevant. I feel it might be damaging for you, too. We'll be back. "After I got her on the lake, I couldn't go through with it. Then the boat turned over." You know, art, he sold me. I believe his story. No more newspapers, Lulu. Remember, I told you. The people of this state charge that the crime of murder in the first degree has been committed by the prisoner at the bar, George eastman. They charge that this same George eastman willfully, and with malice and cruelty and deception, murdered, then sought to conceal from knowledge and justice of the world the boay of Alice Tripp. It will be for you, ladies and gentlemen, to decide what shall be done with this man, who has flouted every moral law, broken every commandment... Who has crowned his infamy with murder. What were Alice's feelings for this defendant? She was in love with him, everybody knew that. What was this rule exactly, Mr. whitting? It was to keep the foreman and members of the staff from fooling around with the girls working there. One night last August, I called Alice to the telephone. It was him calling. Doctor, you never saw this young man? No, but after she left my office, she sat talking with a man in a coupé. - Objection! - Sustained. Along about nine o'clock, he stumbled into my camp. He was wet, and he looked scared and shaky. Well, this man was at the bus station with this girl. They were quarreling, and... She said she wouldn't leave the depo unless he promised. Coroner, did you conclude that violence had been done to Ms. Tripp prior to her death by drowning? Apparently the young woman had been struck by a dull instrument with sufficient force to stun her. I told him there wasn't nobody else on the lake. Then he took the pencil and signed the name of Gilbert Edwards. In short, having signed a false name isn't it a fact that he then proceeded to make sure whatever took place would be observed by no one? No one except the unfortunate person who'd be unable to testify, the girl he drowned? - The prosecution must not... - I withdraw the question. The people rest. This boy is on trial for the act of murder, not for the thought of murder. Between the idea and deed there's a world difference. If you find this boy guilty in desire but not guilty in deed... Then he must walk out of this courtroom as free as you or I. However, since the prosecutor lacked evidence, he's given you prejudice. Lacking facts, he's given you fantasy. Of all the witnesses he's paraded before you, not one actually saw what happened. I will now call to the stand an eyewitness, the only eyewitness. The only one who knows the truth, the whole truth. George eastman, please take the stand. And when we got to the lake, I suggested we go rowing before it got dark. Tell me, George, why did you give a false name to the boat keeper? We were going to stay at the lodge, and we weren't married, so I thought it would be better if we didn't give our right names. Why at this time did you engage the boat to row the girl out onto the lake? In the back of my mind was the thought of drowning her. But I didn't want to think such things! I couldn't help myself, I couldn't! So what happened after you rowed out onto the lake? I knew then that I couldn't do it. Couldn't go through with it. - Then you had a change of heart. - I object. He's leading the witness. Objection sustained. Counsel will refrain from leading the witness. Yes, your honor. What happened then, George? That was when we decided we ought to get back to the lodge. She started talking about getting married and what our life together would be like. What was your reaction to that? To her talking that way? She just looked at me. She knew it was hopeless. She accused me of wishing her dead. Did you, George? Did you wish she were dead? No, I didn't! I wasn't thinking of that any more. What were you thinking of at that moment? I was thinking of somebody else. Another girl. You were thinking that this other girl and her world were lost to you forever. What did you say to Alice's accusation? I told her it wasn't true, I didn't want her to die. Wasn't she alarmed or frightened? - She even said, "poor George.” - Go on. Then she started toward me from the back of the boat. I told her not to, to stay where she was, but she didn't. She kept coming toward me, then she stumbled and started to fall. I started to get up. Then everything turned over. In a second, we were in the water. I was stunned. Something must have hit me as I fell in. It all happened so fast, I didn't know what I was doing. George, was Alice conscious when she fell into the water? Yes, I could heard her scream but couldn't see her, 'cause she was on the other side. So I swam around to the other side. She was... when I got there... She'd gone down. I never saw her again. Do you solemnly swear, before god, that you did not strike Alice Tripp? I do. I swear it! - You did not throw her into that lake? - T did not! That it was an accident undesired by you? I do. I do. I do. That's all, your honor. Fastman... Hat night when you left the party at the house at bride's lake to meet Alice Tripp in the bus station... Do you remember leaving anything behind you? No, I don't. I don't remember leaving anything. I'm referring to your heart, eastman. Did you leave that behind you? Did you, eastman? Out there on that terrace in the moonlight? You left behind, didn't you, the girl you loved, and with her your hopes, your ambitions, your dreams. Didn't you, eastman? You left behind everything you wanted, including the girl you loved. But you planned to return to it, didn't you, eastman? Ansswer me. Yes. Fastman, when you told them all that night you were going to visit your mother, you were lying, weren't you? Yes. When you gave the boat keeper a false name you were lying again, weren't you? Yes. When you drove up to loon lake, what reason did you give Alice Tripp for parking so far away from the lodge? - Because we were out of gas. - Weren't you lying again? - Yes. - Lies! Isn't it a fact that every move you made was built on lies. When you re facing death in the electric chair, you're telling the truth - that's what you want them to believe? - All the same, it's true. I didn't kill her. I want you to step down into the boat and show the jury exactly what happened when the boat overturned. Take the same position you had at the time of the drowning. Eastman, when the girl Rose in the boat to come towards you, did she stumble about there? - Speak up. - Yes. And then? Then she fell sideways into the water. So did 1. - And then what happened? - The boat turned over on top of us. - What happened then? - I couldn't see very clearly. Very likely! After this accidental blow, how far apart were you when you came up? - I don't know exactly. - Oh, you don't know? You couldn't have been more than a yard apart, could you? - It was further than that. - Well, how far? From there to the jury box or halfway or what? About as far as from here to the jury box. Not really. You fell into the water to get her when you and she came up, you're nearly 20 feet apart! That's how I remember it. Why couldn't you swim toward her, instead of away? I don't know. Step over here. Was the boat as far as from here to the bailiff? I guess so, I don't know. You mean to tell me you couldn't swim this distance to this weak girl and buoy her up till you could reach this boat, just 15 feet away? I'll tell you, you know you're lying. She was drowning, and you just let her! She was defenseless in the boat, you picked up this oar like this and you crashed it on that poor girls head! You pushed that poor girl into the lake. You watched her drown. - Isn't that the truth? - No. That's all, your honor. By the premature adoption of an extreme belief and creed, it is well to understand this in looking to the duties of adult life, in particular, the married state, when you will emerges from a sheltered life into a world of grown-up problems for the first time. Only then will he or she view the enthusiasms of youth... Man jury out verdict expected momentarily problems which are the frequent products of a sheltered immaturity. It is at this time, when the sometimes hastily adopted beliefs of youth are found insufficient... - Has the jury reached a verdict? - We have, your honor. The defendant will rise. The clerk will read the verdict. We, the jury, find the defendant, George eastman, guilty of murder in the first degree. Order in the court! - Hello, Mrs. eastman. - Mama. - My boy. - Did you see the governor? It's no use. The governor couldn't be moved. Your mother's done everything a mother could do, George. That I know. Death is a little thing, George, you mustn't be afraid of it. You must fear now only for your immortal soul. If that sin is on your soul, my son, you must make your peace with god. I don't believe I'm guilty of all this. They don't know. I wish I knew. If you are guilty, then I too am guilty. I must share your guilt. Mama, don't blame yourself. You know, they say only god and ourselves know what our sins and sorrows are. Perhaps in this case, only god knows. George, perhaps you ve hidden the full truth of this, even from yourself. I don't wanna hide anything. I wanna know. George, there's one thing you've never told anyone, even yourself. There's one point in your story that holds the answer you're looking for. Yes. When you were on the lake with that poor girl, and the boat capsized and there was a moment when you might have saved her. I wanted to save her. But I just couldn't. But whom were you thinking of? Who were you thinking of, just at that moment? Were you thinking of Alice? Were you thinking of the other girl? Then, in your heart was murder, George. God bless you, my boy. God forgive me if I've failed you. I came to see you. I've thought lots about you, George. All the time. I went away to school... to learn. I don't think I learned very much. I guess there's nothing more to say. I know something now that I didn't know before. I am guilty of a lot of things, most of what they say of me. All the same, I'll go on loving you... For as long as I live. Love me for the time I have left, then forget me. Goodbye, George. It seems like we always spend the best part of our time just saying goodbye. "In my father's house of many mansions, I go to prepare a place for you. I will receive you unto myself that where I am ye may be also.” You'll have to go now, son. "I am the resurrection and the life. He who believeth in me..." Come on, son. "And whosoever liveth and believeth in me... shall never die." So long, kid. You're going to a better world than this. Goodbye, George. I'll be seein' you.
