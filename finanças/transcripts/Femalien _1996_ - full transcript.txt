[MUSIC PLAYING] WOMAN: Collective 3879, personal log. I have been dispatched to the Terran world known as Earth. I've been assigned the task of retrieving data concerning human to human interpersonal relationships, specifically, the compelling need the species has for physical intimacy. I've been given a form that by all indications will prove to be beneficial to this mission. Welcome to Earth, collector. Greetings, Dak. I trust your journey was uneventful. Completely. How do I begin with my collections? Observation and interaction. If you, at any time, feel overwhelmed, please disengage the activity and return to your starship. I can handle myself. I've been in more compelling worlds than this. I shall remind you of that statement at the end of your mission. I'm ready to begin. The advanced scouts team who has prepared this domicile has pre-selected a sample of human environments for you to experience. You may follow their recommendations, or embark on your own course. Do you have your transportation device? I'm ready. You may wish to cover your form. There is wardrobe to the cubicle on your left. A human couple. I'll make this my first observation. I'm out of here. Why don't you call in sick? I can't do that. Yes, you can. You're the boss. And so I should set a good example. Fine. Then leave me here all alone with nothing to do. I'll call you later. Well, can you at least do me a favor? I can't get oil on this suit. Come on, just a little. Nobody does it like you do. Real quick, and no funny business. This is how we always get into trouble, you know. I just don't want to burn. Honest. [MUSIC PLAYING] [BREATHING] Come here. Right here. Oh. Right here. I-- I got to go. That's-- I got to go. Be good. That's no fun. That seems rather abrupt. I was led to believe that these intimate sessions lasted longer. DAK: Do not be so hasty with your conclusions. But it's obvious that the male was disinterested. DAK: Observe. You're nothing but trouble. Come here, you. [MUSIC PLAYING] Does all it take is a touch between two humans to initiate intimacy? DAK: Given the right circumstances and the right combination, apparently so. I ought to be careful who I touch. DAK: Indeed. But first, you need to nourish this body with food. Food? Oh, yes. I remember that in the research. I should like to try some of that. DAK: Proceed. Food. Hey, I didn't hear you come in. Good morning. So far it is. I would like some food. Oh, then you've come to the right place. Just give me a minute to get things going, here. Grab a stool. Do you find this book on aliens interesting? I've always had this fantasy that I'd be the first one on the planet to meet an alien from outer space. And instead of freaking out, I'd kind of go, hey, do you want something to eat? That would be appropriate. So what's your pleasure? Are you hungry, or thirsty, or both? I believe I'm both. How about a monster chicken sandwich or a killer cub salad? I want to try everything. I guess you are hungry. This all looks so pleasing. Well, take a good look around, because this time tomorrow, it'll all be a memory. Memories are good. Maybe. But you can't pay the rent on a memory. Those make inhaling so captivating. Captivating? I've heard my cookies called many things before, but captivating? That's a first. Here. Try one. Exquisite. It's always nice to find a fan of my work. You're new here, aren't you? Very new. If you like my cookies, you're going to go crazy over my chocolate cafe mocha. Very well. Let me go crazy. All right. When you're done, master chef, you can whip her up a chicken sandwich with a cub salad. Huh. I like a woman with a healthy appetite. Oh, is that what you like in your women? Look, don't pay any attention to her. Mm. I don't think we've been properly introduced. I'm Drew. And, uh, this is Sun. I know, I know. What can I say? But both my parents were hippies. I've got a sister named Star and a brother named Moon. Very astral. I think that is wonderful. My name's Kara. Nice to meet you, Kara. Enjoy yourself. Listen, oh, master chef, I have a feeling that we're going to be swamped with everyone coming in for the last hurrah. We're going to need some more of your creations. Yeah, you're the boss. Uh, say, Kara. You're not going anywhere, are you? Should I? No. You kn-- I mean, you know, if-- if you were going to stick around, um-- What Romeo's trying to say is he doesn't want to let you out of his sights. Well, that is one way of putting it. Get cooking. Good morning. Get out of here, you vulture. Now, is that any way to greet a friendly neighbor? You don't take over this place until tomorrow. And until then, we have the right to refuse service to anyone. I've told you, Sun, you're more than welcome to join my organization. I mean, someone of your beauty would be a definite asset. Thanks, but you can stuff it, unless, of course, you've changed your mind, decided to sell me back the cafe. No, that wouldn't be right. Not after all the trouble I had buying your mortgage back from the bank. You mean stealing it. Oh, you call it stealing. I call it an acquisition. The real question is, how would a row of hot tubs look along this wall? Watch closely and see what it's like to be completely ignored. I'm mortally wounded. You know, this would be perfect for a towel counter. You are not friendly with Sun or Drew. Sun has a problem with commerce. That's why she can't keep this place going. She gives away more food than she sells. I mean, can I help it if I'm so successful that I have to tear down these walls to add to my operations? Can you? The name's MJ. I own the Rubdown. Total body workout next door. You really should visit. It's a great experience. Really? A great experience? Ask anyone who's been there. Be my pleasure to give you the VIP treatment. Don't let this bloodsucker rope you in. I'm sorry, uh, weren't you supposed to be ignoring me? Scram. Suit yourself. But please consider my invitation, miss-- Kara. That's a beautiful name. I'm going. But I'll be back. That bastard. You are upset. Damn straight. Do you want another cup of coffee? Damn, that's hot. Kara, can you grab me that rag? I can't believe what a klutz I am. Thanks. Allow me. [MUSIC PLAYING] I guess it didn't burn after all. It sure felt like it. I want some exceptional experiences while I'm here. Oh, well, I guess that's what vacations are for. What did you have in mind? Whatever's the most stimulating. Hm, good call. Let me think. How out of this world did you want to go? Well, I can go pretty far out of this world. Well, I know this photographer, Harry. He's just up the block. And he does some very unique things. I've even modeled for him a couple times. I think he's shooting this morning. You should go check him out. - He won't mind? - Are you kidding? He loves an audience. Listen, he's three doors down. I'll give him a holler and tell him you're on your way. It'll be a great way to spend a few hours. And this will be a good experience? Oh, yeah. Thank you. No problem. Just come back and tell me how it went. I will. What is it with you two today? I need passion. May I suggest something? Oh, please. [MUSIC PLAYING] Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I have never seen anything so-- oh, intense before. I can't wait to get those developed. I need more experience now. Can I help you? Please say yes. So many choices. This is fascinating. So, you looking for something to spice up the old boudoir? Or is there someone special in your life? Is that important? Oh, no. Not if you don't want it to be. Do you have someone special in your life? Honey, I have so many special someones in my life, I can't keep track. I guess you can say I like a little variety. Variety? I feel the same way. I would like to observe variety. Ooh, then you have definitely come to the right place. I didn't catch your name. Kara. I'm Angel and this is Gina. We're going to give you a very special showing. [MUSIC PLAYING] That was very enlightening. We'd like you to have this as a gift. Thank you. If you'd really like to see something interesting, a friend of mine is giving a little party tonight. It's a performance art piece. We provided all the wardrobe. It's kind of weird, kind of kinky. Kinky? Real kinky. Kinky. Hey, nice outfit. I thought you'd vanished. - No. My collections won't be complete until a total rotation of the planet. I like the way you look at things. Oh, and Harry called. He said you were a great inspiration to him. It was a very enlightening experience. Thank you for the recommendation. We have got to stop meeting like this. Why? Is it bad? No, uh, it was just a little joke. See, Drew? I told you you're not funny. Drew. Have you ever been kinky? Um, given the right occasion, sure. What exactly is kinky? I guess it depends on your own personal tastes. I mean, some people can get pretty wild in bed. I believe I'm ready for interaction now. What do you mean? Come here, you. [MUSIC PLAYING] Can we be intimate? Well, I mean-- whoa. Oh, yes. The hesitancy. It's part of the interplay. Go on. Resist some more. I think it's pleasurable. W-- wait a minute. You're trying to say you want to hook up with me? Right here, right now? Hook up? We are talking about the same thing, aren't we? [MUSIC PLAYING] We are. Perhaps we should do it in a more comfortable environment. Would you like to return to my domicile? Your place? Uh, let me think about it. Uh, yeah. Listen. I got something in the oven. Let me go yank that out, and then I'm all yours. Don't you move. Hey, where's the fire? What got into him? I asked him back to my place. You don't waste any time, do you? I like that. Have you experienced Drew? You mean slept with him? Yeah, a couple of times. But we found out we work out a lot better as friends. Is he a typical male? Typical? No. But great in the sack. Have fun. Just bring him back in one piece. Uh, by the way, Sun. I'm going to go ahead and take my break now. Wait. Um, first, grab me those coffee bags off the top shelf in the store room. But Sun, I was just going to go get together with-- Keep talking and I'll make you do the dishes. I'm doing it. Oh, this will only take a sec. Oh, listen. My car's in the shop. Do you have any transportation? - Sleep. Domicile. The male form is quite different than the female. DAK: Did you terminate this human for collection? You know we haven't done that in centuries. He's sleeping. I think I want to interact with him. DAK: Seems like a worthy candidate. Where are we? My place. The hell? Did I pass out? What's going on? If I'm dreaming, don't wake me. Would you prefer my garments off? Absolutely. Did I break you? I think you did. But I'll recover. Wow. You are simply not human. Does it show? Let's just say I've never met anyone like you before. I'm glad I could be of service. I forgot about this experience. Would you like to go with me? Oh, Sun is going to kill me if I don't get back to the cafe. As you wish. Sleep. You were a great experience. My life is about expression. What is the perfect medium for my message? The human body. So perfect. So unique. There's no telling where your innocence can carry you. [MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] Hello again. I think I need some more food. This body just can't keep up with all that energy I'm expelling. I'll get you something. I can't stop thinking about you. Did we really leave here? And did we really do everything I think we did? I'm in such a fog. Of course, some would say that's my normal state of mind. Would you like to hook up and get kinky again? Hold on a second. I need a little time to recharge. Oh, I completely understand. Sun doesn't appear to be very happy. Yeah, I know. I caught her crying twice today already. That damn MJ. I'd like to go next door and just strangle the deed to this place right out of him. Would that make her happy? Probably not. She hates violence. But the deed would put a smile on her face. Here we are. And MJ will be right with you. Enjoy your massage. - Thank you. I was about ready to leave for the day. Glad you decided to take me up on my offer. Usually, I don't handle the clientele, but, uh, in your case, I will definitely make an exception. I would like to experience everything you have to offer. You got it. Why don't you slip out of what you're wearing and, uh-- we'll get started. Very nice. Would you like a towel? Do I need one? Well, only if you, uh-- no. Not at all. Here. Hop up on the table and, uh, I'll dive right in. [MUSIC PLAYING] You have really skilled hands. Years of experience. Do you really need to knock down the wall? Huh? Didn't you say you were going to knock down the wall into Sun's cafe? Right, yes. The wall. I do not see why you cannot give Sun the-- what was it? Oh, yeah. The deed. Yeah, the deed. That is it. Why can't you give her the deed? It's not that simple. If you have this deed now, you can give it to her. Sounds simple to me. Simple, yes. Whatever you say. Are you happy? God, yes. Let me do something for you. [MUSIC PLAYING] Am I doing this with sufficient skill? Yes. You are a good teacher. Can I show you something? Please. God. Oh. [BREATHING] What was that? I have been collecting energy patterns for our archives. I can access them any time I want and share them. That was incredible. Where did you learn that trick? I've been doing it for years. Wouldn't it be great if everyone could feel that good? Yes. Sun would if you give her the deed. Yes. Can she have it? Oh, of course. That is very nice of you. Where is it? It's the briefcase. Thank you. Hey, you're back. Where's Sun? She's meditating. I have something for her. Well, she's just up the block at the astral projections. Wait. Will you be back? Perhaps. She's driving me crazy. [MUSIC PLAYING] Welcome to astral projections. How may I assist you? I'm looking for Sun. She's in the meditation chamber. Am I disturbing you? Kara. No. What are you doing here? I've come to make you happy. What's this? Your deed. Where did you get this? From MJ. He wants you to be happy. We all do. I don't get this. Did you pay him? I gave him something more valuable than money. There's nothing more valuable than money to MJ. I think there is. Look. [MUSIC PLAYING] I knew this stuff was relaxing, but this is ridiculous. Shh. Observe. There's the woman who stole the deed. Arrest her. What the hell are you doing? God. Shit. Did you see what they were doing to that policeman? I think he was enjoying himself. Yeah, you could say that again. Are you happy with your deed? You know I can't keep this. Why not? You saw the look on MJ's face. Soon as those guys get their act together, they're going to be right over here. You know, maybe it's better that I just walk away from this place. If MJ wants it so bad, let him have it. Are you sure? I've been thinking. Maybe it's good to give your life a major shakeup every now and then. Keeps things interesting. There's something I would like to share with you. OK. Domicile. What the hell was that? Simple transportation. No, a cab ride is simple transportation. That was something alien. You said you wanted to meet an alien from outer space. You mean to tell me that you're from-- this is all too weird. All my life I've dreamed of this moment. But I never thought the first alien I would meet would be so-- so beautiful. You're not what I imagined. I was waiting for little green men. Different star system. So what are you doing here? We've been visiting your earth for centuries. Collecting data, cataloging human sensory experiences. Our species have evolved beyond a solid physical state to a level of nearly pure energy. So this isn't your real body? On my planet, we're all linked telepathically. It can be comforting, but something similar to human intimacy, it's not possible for us. You don't know what you're missing. The point is now I do. Wow. An alien from outer space wants to make love to me? Fuck it. Let's go for it. [MUSIC PLAYING] Mm, I've never felt like this. Neither have I. WOMAN: I can handle myself. I've been in more compelling worlds than this. DAK: Mm-hm. Dak. DAK: It's merely a reminder. Do you have to go back to your world? I'm a collector. It's all I know. Well, I'm starting a new life. Why can't you? DAK: Yes, why can't you? Even Dak thinks so. DAK: There is no reason why you can't continue to collect data and stay here to experience Sun. Sounds like a plan to me. Oh, but what about Drew? Drew. Drew. I know I'm not dreaming now. Just go with the flow, baby. [MUSIC PLAYING]
