Nobody is going to pick me up here on the side of the road. You know something.. Money only lasts for so long, but music... Music lasts forever. You want my guitar? Nah, the gold... And the guitar. My old man gave me this guitar. A wise man once said... Please no more riddles ok? I tell you what... You throw in the saddle and you got a deal. Woahhh. Look, you want to make a deal or not?

Lock up your wives and daughters, Eden Jackson is back in town. You believe the nerve of this guy. Showing his face around here again. Can I help you officers? It's Mr. Officer to you scumbag. Yes sir. Well, nice car you got here. Not quite the hot stuff you used to be huh? No sir. Shut up. What are you doing back here? Come back to pay the ex wife a little visit? You know, I don't think her new husband is going to appreciate that much. What do you think Baker? Now what makes you think she's going to want a loser like you anyway? Come on get out of the car. I said get out of the car. On what grounds? Grounds of loitering. I'm sitting in my car! Right, loitering. Now get your convict butt out of the car. I'm not going to ask you again. Get outta here. Just how stupid are you showing your face around here again? It's a free country. I'll show you a free country. Alright that’s enough. I said that’s enough. Well, you just can't keep your mouth shut can you? Lets go. Watch yourself Jackson. [Police Sirens] -Music- Morning Mom. Morning son. What time is it? 10 am. I knew the smell would wake you. Oh my Gosh. Oh. What happened to you? I don't want to talk about it, I'm fine ok? You went into town, didn't you? You got to know people are not going to be happy to see you around. You got to prepare yourself for that. Mom, please I said don't worry about it ok? Here you uh, enjoy this. I made you eggs the way you like them with a little milk. Thank you. Yea. Mmmm. I forgot how good food can taste. I, I can't believe you're back. I mean you're actually here Eden. Happened so fast I can't believe it myself. Right before my very eyes I... I just wish... Momma. Nothin son. Thinking about Daddy right? It's just too bad he couldn't be here when you came home. Did he suffer much before he died? Well, it wasn't easy for him, but he did the best he could. He had a lot of regrets. Things he.. He couldn't change. Was he disappointed in me? Oh, No. He was more worried that he wasn't a good Father. Well, it wasn't his fault. I know son. Just you know he... He came from a long line of well... Troubled people. Looks like I'm following him right along huh? Don't you dare say that. This is your chance. To do something different. It's up to you son. Not sure where to start. Well... You just have to take some time, and uh.. Just keep moving. That's what I did when your daddy died. I just kept living. One day at a time. Some nights I would... I'd pull out empty boxes and... Id start to pack all of his stuff. And other nights I'd just drink my self to sleep. Well I'm sorry Mom. You don't ever have to be sorry. You just have to be ok. Not a bad looking horse. Got some age on him, but still looks pretty good. Where'd you get him? Traded some old boy my guitar. Is that right? Yea, he was either going to turn him loose or turn him into dog food, and I couldn't let that happen. No sir. Hm. I am downright ashamed the way I let this place go. It's not so bad. Hm. Well I hope you'd do me a favor and help me put it back in order. Yea, well I'd be happy to Mom. It'll keep me busy while I'm figuring some things out. Also I got something for you. Oh, hey Mom I'm fine, I'm getting money in a few weeks. Well you're going to need some until then, so don't argue with me just take it. And uh.. I got something else for you. Keys to your Daddy's truck. It may need a battery, but I bet you it still runs pretty good. I bet your Daddy's going to look down and get a big chuckle. Cause you were always so embarrassed when he drove it. Remember that? Serves me right I guess, huh? Yea it does. Thank you Mom. -Music- [Engine revving] What'd the other guy look like? Excuse me? Oh yeah, yeah. I stepped on a rake. Thought that only happened on TV. You'd be surprised. How can I help you? Well I uh.. I need ten bales of alfalfa. I think we can manage that. Anything else? Yea I don't know what kind of horse feed you have, but I need something that would be good for an old horse. Well we have a lot of products with glucose amine, it's good for older horses. Glucosa what? Glucose amine. It's a feed supplement. Ok. Have you been living in a cave? Well as a matter of fact I have. I'm sorry I didn't mean anything... No, Ill take the best darn bag of glucose amine you got. -Music- [Cheering] Woo, woo! Yeaaaa!!! What was that? Oh, come on Christopher pull your head out of your... Stop! What? -Music- Yea! That’s more like it Christopher. That’s the way to woop their butts! You boys are going down! Would you sit down already. Don't fool yourself, it's a kids baseball game for God's sake. Well anyway I ain’t watching the game. There... What are you looking at? Who are you pointing at? Right there behind the dugout. Oh my Gosh, its Eden. Yea. What the hecks is he doing out of prison. I don't know, He never told me. Well it don't matter anyway cause there he is, and apparently he is a free man. Games over. Yea. I'm going to go talk to him. No, you're not. I mean it. Ok. I'm going to get Chris. Ok. [Cheering] What the heck is the matter with you? What the heck is the matter with me? What the heck is the matter with you? You son of a gun. Hey... You've been home for how long and you don't come see me? I just got back in town man. Oh man, I had to come hunt you down. I can't believe they let you out. You must have been a good boy. Well I tried my best. Man it's good to see you. It's good to see you. You are still ugly as ever. What'd you expect. Well maybe you'd get a little pretty. No, no chance of that. You ain’t changed a bit man. I don't know about that. Where you been? Who've you seen? Who'd you upset? You know, I did go down by the baseball field. I saw Pam down there. She with that idiot husband of hers? Oh yeah. Son of a gun. Don't even think about it man. She moved on. I’m not thinking about nothing. Ok. Cause there plenty of ladies around here trust me. I know you got to be itching for that. So you're the one who hasn't changed. You know I'm not going to change. I do know that. Listen, I appreciate you come by to see me man. Alright, I got to take off. Don't make me come and hunt you down next time. Alright? Alright. I better see your face at the store, soon. I got it. You think you might consider joining back up with the band? You know, that just always seemed to get me in trouble, ya know? Yea I understand that. It's a tricky deal. Alright. Hey, if you change your mind about playing some music... It's a standing offer. Alright. I'll catch you later. It's good to see you brother. I know he's in town, I seen him myself. I thought he was in for ten years? Well, good behavior and prison overcrowding. Psh, that's a load of crap. When you murder two people. It wasn't murder Larry, it was vehicular homicide. What are you defending him? No. I'm just saying... Trust me, I don't think its right. Him walking around a free man after what he did. Well what are we going to do about it? I don't think I know what you mean. See you guys. See you boys in church Sunday. Alright. I'm not a big fan of Eden Jackson ok? But if he don't do nothing wrong.. We can keep bothering him. Ahem. Let me ask you a question Gerry. I mean correct me if I'm wrong but.. Didn't I have something to do with you becoming Sheriff? You know you did. Yea. Well I need a little help here, ya see? I don't need this Eden Jackson, this ex con, in my life. You hear what I'm saying? Can I get you boys anything else? I'll tell you what sweetheart. How about... A slice of that delicious apple pie, and a cup of coffee. Sure thing Mr. Hannigan. Oh you call me Larry, ok? Ok. Ok. You understand what I'm saying here? Whats the matter Larry, you think that pretty young wife of yours is just going to pack up and leave? You watch your mouth, Baker. I'm sorry I'm just trying... No, you're just nothing. I don't need this son of a gun marching in here, and screwing up my life. It's not going to happen, understand? It's not going to happen. I'm sure between the three of us we can figure something out. Here you go Larry. Wow. Why thank you Violet. Almost as pretty as you. What are you looking at a bird, Dog? You wouldn't know what to do with that. Hey buddy, good morning. How are you? Big fella... Alright. Hello Eden. Hmm, your uh... You're Momma told me you picked up a horse on your way back from prison. Yea, I guess you can say that. What brings you out here? Just wanted to see you. Could of seen me plenty over the last 8 years, why now? Curious I guess. Curious. Curious about what? Maybe curious to see how you made it through. Couldn't have been easy. Nope. So you mad at me? Mad at you for what? Come on Eden you know what I'm talking about. You moved on, what can I say? I had no choice. If you say so. I was devastated Eden, you have no idea what I went through. The sheets weren't even cold before Larry Hannigan moved in my bed. What do you expect me to do after what happened? It was an accident Pam. Oh right, cheating on me was no accident. I didn't come here to argue with you. Yea, well why did you come? I came to tell you something. Well than say it. You got something to say, say it!! You want to tell me what a no good piece of garbage I am, and how I deserve all of this? I know that’s what you're thinking. Never mind, it's no use talking to you. You know what... I feel sorry for you Eden, I really do. You had everything. You pushed it away. -Music- Can I get you something? Uh, soda please. Sure. Hello. Hello Dad. How you doing? Bout the same. I brought you something. Huh? They gave me permission. You can keep it. It's a classic 1962 Martin. Your pal Jake helped me pick it out. Sounds pretty good. It is beautiful Dad. [Guitar strumming] He said to say hello. [Sigh] Sent you a license plate with his name on it. That rotten son of a gun. Well I thought it would help the time pass here. I don't know what to say. Oh you don't have to say nothin, just write some pretty music, so I can tap my foot to it. Alright. Ok I will. Hi. Hello. Hi. I thought that was you over here. I hope I'm not bothering. No, not at all. I just came by to listen to my old buddy play some music. They're really good. Yea, yea they are. Why don't you have a seat. Sure. I'll sit down for a sec. I um... I really just wanted to apologize for what I said the other day. I had no idea. No worries, it is what it is ya know? I'm Eden Jackson by the way. Shelly. Nice to meet you Shelly. Likewise. So uh.. How long have you worked down at the feed store. Well actually, I bought it about three years ago. Really? Good for you. Yea, I enjoy it. I’ve always had a thing for taking care of animals. Is that right? Yea. I thought Id be a vet, but it didn't really work out. You know what they say it's never too late. Well, I don't want to intrude. I just want to apologize. Tell your friend I think he's really good. Yea, I'll tell him. I'm sure I'll see you around, sometime. And you know, if you need anything for your horse, whatever... You know where I am. I do. Um... Look Eden, I don't want to... Put my foot in my mouth again but... I heard that you might be looking for work, and I could actually use a lot of help down at the feed store. Well that's very kind of you Shelly, but I will find something somewhere. Well I'm not asking to be kind. I could really use the help. So, think about it. I will. Ok. What the hell are you doing seeing him? How did you know? It's a small town Pam, haven't you noticed. News travels fast. You know not only is he an ex con, but he's your ex husband. I mean what did you think you'd accomplish by seeing him? I don't know. You don't know? What kind of answer is that? You still have feelings for him, is that what this is? How dare you say that to me. Well why'd you go see him? You know why I saw him. Well, why didn't you tell me? I saw him for Christopher. I'm Christopher's father, you don't talk to anyone about my son unless I know. Do you really think that this is something we could keep from Eden? Scratch Eden, I was a father to that kid for 8 years. I know, I'm not denying that. But you and I both know you've always wanted something back. I mean he doesn't even call you Dad for heavens sake, is that a little boys fault? You hardly touch him, you never tell him that you love him. I understand that he didn't come from you... Ok. You made your point. I got it... I got it. There’s no sense in making a big deal out of this. You know, I doubt Eden will want anything to do with him anyway. Well, what if he does? How are we going to include Eden into our lives? I don't know. I mean how is that going to work? I don't know, I thought we would just figure it out! Oh we'd just figure it out? You think the world works like that? I don't want you to see him anymore. Christopher doesn't need this type of garbage in his life. You don't know what's best for Christopher. No. Don't do this Pam. I'm warning you. You're going to be sorry. Don't you dare threaten me. Hey, look who finally made it. Yea finally. What brings you into town? Looking to stir up some trouble? Maybe. Good, I'm into that. That's what I hear. Ya know, I was down at Joe's the other night. I heard you guys playing, you sounded good. Well shoot man, I didn't even see you. Who you hiding from anyway? I'm not hiding, just keeping a low profile. Alright. Hey you uh.. You got a decent acoustic in here? You can give me for a good price. Yea I got something for ya. What happened to the uh.. The Martin your old man got ya? Oh it's a long story. Alright. Well check this out. It's used, comes from Vietnam or some freakin' place but uh... Sounds pretty nice. [Guitar Strumming] Good, I'll take it. Good, take it then. No, I'm not going to take it. Either I pay for it or it stays here. You stubborn son of a gun, 100 bucks. Alright. And I'll throw in this beautiful case. Ok, you got it. Thank you. Here you go. You know Jake there is one more thing I wanted to ask you if you don't mind. Shoot. Well these are some, some songs I wrote while I was locked up. I was wondering if you would just take a look at them, and let me know what you think. Alright man. Cant be worse than the crap I write. Alright, well I appreciate it. Alright. Ok, Thank you. It was good to see you. Good to see you man. Don't be a stranger. I won't, I won't. Bring lunch next time huh. You got it. [Guitar strumming] It's nice to have music in the house again. You think I made a mistake coming back here? I don't think so. Where else were you going to go? This is home. Yea I know, but I was just thinking it might have been easier to start over somewhere else. Ya know? That's up to you. Running away is never the answer. I'm not running, I just want a fair shake. Oh no. What in the world is he doing here? I don't know, but I will take care of it. No... I said go in the house. I'll handle it. Can I do something for you Larry? Ahem, I think you've done enough, haven't ya? I don't know what you're talking about. Well sure you do Eden. What do you want? Don't play dumb with me Jackson. I want you to stay out of my business, understand? All do respect Larry, but I don't know what the heck you're talking about, and I suggest you get a little more clear, or get the heck off my property. Oh really? Or what? Get out of my face. Come on Eden, take swing right here. Come on big shot. [Laughter] I knew you wouldn't do it. Stay the heck away from my family, you understand? Get back in the truck, and you go on your way. I mean it Larry. Wow, that's a pretty heavy shotgun you got there Beth. Oh I get it now, Momma fights your battles for ya. That makes sense. Go on now get, I mean it. Yes ma'am, obviously you're the one wearing the pants around here. You know I raised that kid for 8 years. Doesn't matter who's blood he is, he belongs to me understand? You stay away from my family. You've been warned. I wasn't going to say anything but I... I had a pretty good idea. I saw that boy once in town and... I knew he had to belong to you. You should've said something to me. It wasn't my place Eden. I figured if it was meant to be... You would find out sooner or later. So... What are you going to do? Nothing. How they treating ya? It's not so bad. Plenty of books to read. Guitar helps keep me sane. Well that’s good. It's pretty lonely. How did it get to this? Seems like you've been here so long. Well I'll be out before you know it. It just ain’t right. Kid makes a mistake and they lock him up like an animal. I don't know why this happened but it did. And I'm not going to spend more time trying to answer that question. But I would like you to promise me one thing... Whats that? Whatever you do, when you get out of here, and you will... You do your best to leave it behind ya. Cause if you don't its going to eat you up, and you ain’t going to be no good for nobody. Remember that time I took you hunting, you were in high school, and we went up to hells canyon? Yea. You shot a buck, and I went on ahead to find that deer I wounded. I told you to follow that ridge all the way back and you'd get to the camp. You remember that? Yea, how could I forget. Well you knew better, you went off down through that canyon darn near killed ya. Found you the next day scared, beat silly. I figured if getting lost didn't kill me than you surely would. Yea. Well I ain’t one to pray, but I did that night. You did? I did. Well, I'm going to tell you now what I told you then. You get on top of that ridge and you follow it right out of here. And you try real hard to find something real good in all this mess, and more importantly... the good in yourself. I couldn't do that myself. What do you mean, you did fine. I didn't do fine. I wasted a lot of precious time. I lost sight in what was important in life. Huh. But the time has passed now and I don't have time to think about that. Anymore. But you can... Dad, you're talking like you're not going to see me when I get out of here. Eden my health hasn't been so good lately. Doctors think I should go down to Salt Lake for more testing, but it don't look good. What? What are you talking about? No. No. You'll be fine, Dad you are as strong as an ox. This old ox is on its last legs. No don't say that you are a fighter, you got to fight this. Visiting hours are over, wrap it up. -Music- Hey. Don't you have people to do that? You'd be surprised how hard it is to find good help these days. Is that right? If you know anybody with a strong back who likes long hours and hard work let me know. Well you know what, I might know just the guy. -Music- Hey Shelly. Hey. How was your day? It was good. Feels good to work, ya know? Listen I uh.. I want to thank you for giving me this job. Like I said I really needed the help. I know, but not everyone in this town would give me that chance. I never really was too concerned about what other people think. You know you might take some heat for it. Ill deal with it. Ok. So how did you end up in this one horse town anyway? Well, that’s kind of a long story. You really want to know? I was living in Salt Lake. And... I decided that I needed to make a change, and I took off one morning to visit a friend in Boise and I made a wrong turn, and I ended up here. I thought you said it was a long story? Well... I gave you the short version. I see. But it um.. It just felt right. Ya know? And hey with a name like Soda Springs I thought... It must be a pretty good place to live. Hm, so much for your woman's intuition. It's not that bad. You know I've actually grown to love it here. Well, what made you want to leave Salt Lake? Typical story. My husband decided that he needed the younger version. I won't bore you with those details. I'm sorry about that. Ok. It was difficult for a while, but I'm getting there. That's good. What about you? Whats it like being back home? It's different. I bet. You know why I went away don't you? It's a small town. Yea. And you're ok with it? I gave you a job didn't I? Yes you did, and I appreciate it. Well it was my pleasure. See you tomorrow. Yea. And you know for what it's worth, your ex husband... He should have his head examined. Goodnight. Goodnight. Alright is that going to do it? That'll do it. Ok. I think you're going to be happy with this one. That is $31.79. 32... Ok out of 32. Alright Kirk, 21 cents is your change. You take care. Thank you, say hi to your mother too. I'll do that. Hi Eden, how are you? I'm ok. You? I'm good. Heard you were working here. Yea. Got to pay the bills. These your kids? Yea these are them. I’ve got my hands full. They are cute kids. Thanks. Uh... That's um.. That's $16.95 please. 20? 5 makes 17, 18, 19 and 20. It's good to see you. Good to see you. Take care. I will. Hello? Hello there. How are you ladies today? Ok is that going to be it? Eden Jackson, working for a living. Got to admit, looks pretty good on you. Well thank you. Listen Eden... I just want you to know that when I came by your house the other day... I had every intention telling you about your son. Look I know this is a whole lot for you to take right now but... I was wondering if maybe you'd want to meet Christopher? Why don't you just come over and say hi? He's here now? I don't know Pam. Look Eden I'm not trying to put you on the spot, but Larry is at work and it could be a good time for you to at least meet him. What do I say? I'm sure you'll figure it out. Come on. Hey Chris honey... I want you to meet somebody. Hi Mr. Eden. Hi Chris, It's nice to meet you. It's nice to meet you too. Is that your truck. Yea that's my truck. It could use a coat a paint couldn't it? I like it. Well thank you. You know I saw you play in a baseball game the other day. Really? Yea. You are really good. I've hit 6 home runs so far. 6 home runs? That is incredible. Do you play baseball? You know I used to. A long time ago. You know, I was a falcon just like you. Really? Yea. Had a hat just like yours. You did? Yea. Only mine, it was all worn out cause I never took it off. My mom thought it was permanently attached to my head. I slept with mine on once. Did you go to my school? Yea. Valleyview Elementary right? Yea. Do you still live here? You know I just moved back. We got to get going ok. Why don't you say goodbye and meet mommy in the car ok? Goodbye Mr. Eden. Goodbye Chris. Nice to meet you Chris. Nice to meet you too. You ok? Yea. I just really wanted you to meet him. Thank you. You did good Eden. Look what I found. -Music- Knock Knock Hey Eden. Hey. How was the day? Not bad. That's good. So um, was there something you wanted to ask me? Why would you think that? I don't know because you're acting strange. Well you know... I was wondering uh, I know you like to ride, and I just thought... You know, I know some good places just outside of town. Maybe we can take off one of these days and ride. I would like that. Very much. Great. Uhh, how about Sunday? Sunday would be perfect. Alright, great. Goodnight. Goodnight. -Music- I like this. What's that? Being here... with you. I agree. -Music- Larry. What do you want? I'd just like to talk to you for a minute. I ain’t got nothing to say to you. I thought we might be able to work this out man to man. Listen. There ain’t nothing to work out here. I told you to stay away from my family. That’s all you need to know. I don't want to get in the way of you and your family, I'd just... I'd like a chance to come and see Chris once in a while and maybe... Take him to a game or... You just don't get it do you, you know what... Call the cops and tell them to come down here. Yea. What? What? Well that's right get back in that fancy truck of yours. Run back to mommy, she'll protect you. Didn't go so well? What's it matter anyway, I'm not cut out to be a Dad. Who says? I say. Eden... Shelly look.. I appreciate everything I really do, but what do I have to offer this kid huh? He's better off right where he is. Come on you really think that? Yea. I probably just screw him up anyway, and then he'd just be another one in a long line of screw ups. So why don't you be the one to change things? Look Eden I don't know what you're afraid of. But I really think that Christopher would be a lucky boy to have you a part of his life. -Music- You think this is a good idea? Probably not. Larry at work? Yea. He's going to have to come to terms with it somehow right. Chris knows your his dad. Did you tell him? He just figured it out on his own. Kids just pick up on things. How does he feel about it? He hasn't said anything, but... I know my kid. He's thrilled. I just don't know why you didn't say something to me before... Eden, it would have only made things worse for you. I honestly thought that I was doing the right thing by not telling you. Larry's not going to like this one bit. I know. Of all the people you could've gotten involved with... Eden, just stop. Don't start. He was there for us when you weren't, like it or not. How does he treat Chris? He's fine. He tried, ya know? He's never been mean to him or anything but... There was just something missing. It's hard to explain. As a mom, it kind of breaks your heart sometimes. What about you? Are you happy? Depends what you define as being happy. For the most part yea. I guess I'm happy. But there is always that one part of me that will wonder what things would of been like, ya know? Yea. Hey Mr. Eden, can you come hit us some ground balls please?

Buenes noche senorita. I know the truth. [Kncok Knock] Hi Sonya. Look, I'm really sorry to bother you this late, but I really need to talk to you about something. Go ahead Sonya, tell them what you told me. Well, we... We were both at the bar that night, and I guess one thing led to another. Eden didn't want to leave, but I told him I was ok to drive. And uh... So we were heading to the motel and he tried to get in the drivers seat, but I pushed him back and I got in front of the wheel, and we started heading out. Peter Still was there tonight. Remember Peter Still, he tried to get up on stage with you that one time, remember, and he was there tonight again. And he was so drunk he threw up, so they had to kick him out. Where the hell are we? Where we going? Eden, are you listening to me? Eden? Eden... Woah. Are you passed out? No, I'm fine, I'm good don't worry. Just drive. Eden... Fell asleep, and I was trying to wake him up. As soon as I looked away I looked back at the road... [Cars Crashing] Are you ok Eden? Oh my god, this can't happen. I can't... Eden I have babies at home I can't go to jail, I have babies at home. This is an accident, We'll be fine. I'm drunk, it's drunk driving. Oh my God, Eden we can't stay here. We have to go Eden, we can't be here when the police get's here. No, no. Oh my God Eden, they're dead. They're not dead, listen! Listen to me. There’s a road, there’s a road just take it and run. Run! Run! Sonya... I want you to get up from that chair, I want you get out of this office, and I never want you to breathe a word of this to another living soul you understand? What about... Don't worry, Ill... Fix it. Got enough damage done already. I'll go get Eden. Thank you. I'll uh... Leave you two alone. Eden. I'm sorry. Really. What's going on? Doesn't matter. Everything is ok.

We have a very special guest musician tonight. Eden Jackson everybody, come on! Wish me luck. Good luck. And.. That's for you. Where'd you get this? Some old man came in to the store and said it belonged to you. You’re amazing. Well Jay, thank you very much for letting me up here tonight I really appreciate it. It's been a long time. This is a song called "Starting with You'", and it's written for a very special friend of mine. Her name is Shelly, and she's sitting right over there. [Song Lyrics] Turn my life around. Help me get my feet back on the ground. Took me for what I am. Haven't always felt like much of a man. Know I’ve done some things I'm not proud of, but you've given me another chance with your loveeee. Starting with you, I’m going to make you this promise. I will always be faithful and honest. Take me out of the dark, straight to your heart, and there ain’t nothing I can't do. Cause I'm starting with you. Never asked about my past. You just smiled and said now don't look back. You held me in your arms. It's the first time I felt safe and warm. I believe now things are now only gonna get better. I got a brand new way of looking at life, I can see foreverrrrrr. Starting with you, I’m going to make you this promise. I will always be faithful and honest. Take me out of the dark, straight to your heart, and there ain’t nothing I can't do. Cause I'm starting with you. Starting with you. I'm starting with you. [Cheers] Welcome home brother. -Music-
