Ticket, please. - You want to try the special Christmas lottery? A million-dollar winner each week from Thanksgiving till Christmas Eve. - Yeah, why not?

She, she... needed something to put her jewellery in. Definitely burn. - You know, burning all the stuff you gave her is not gonna take the sting out of getting dumped, pal. - Hey, she didn't dump me, OK? She threw me out of the house; told me never to come back. So I broke up with her. Melt. - Why don't you just ask her to take you back? - She doesn't want me back. What am I supposed to do?

I guess that's what I get for coming home. - Look at the bright side: we get to hang together, like the old days. - Yes, that is bright. But, uh, I really do think it's time to get your own place. - I'm working on it, Mikey. I'm in mourning right now. I'm sensitive. - Love: it always burns. - Hey, this might melt.

Nice work, college boy. Dad would be so proud. You idiot! You burned off your eyelashes. [Coughing] - [Boy]: This the Green Flash's brother, the Green Bean. And look, he's bald!

How'd it go? - Oh, the interview for the waitress job went great; the hostess job, not so great. Um, but I've got another lead. - I hate to see your talent wasted serving someone else's food. - Oh, speaking of which, I found the most perfect apartment over on College Avenue. It's right on the second floor above an empty commercial space. I was thinking it would be so amazing to have my café downstairs, and Max and I living upstairs. - Christmas is the time for dreaming. - I guess it is a dream, isn't it? - I didn't mean it like that. - Mmm... Hello. You, go get ready for your sleepover. - These cookies are great. - Oh, good. - You and Max can stay here as long as you need. - Thank you, Tony, but here I am cooking for you because I can't pay the rent. What kind of role model is that for Max? - You're showing him life doesn't always work out exactly as you want, but you don't stop trying to make it better. - I don't know what we'd do without the two of you. How about some Sicilian soup with four-cheese focaccia for dinner? - You don't have to cook tonight. I'll cook. - I'm not sure I can handle that. I'll cook. - I'll cook. A deal's a deal. Besides, I've got a great new dessert recipe that'll put you right in the Christmas spirit. - Is something wrong? - Nothing at all. Other than the fact that Max evidently told his Scout leader that his dad would take him to the Christmas Eve Pinewood Derby. - I thought his father hadn't been in touch for years. - Exactly. ♪ Hey. - Hey, Mom. This is my derby car. - I like it. I like it. - This is what it's gonna look like. - Oh, cool! But, um... but listen, I want to just ask you what... what is this? "Dear Mr. Ceroni, we're happy you and Max are entering the Pinewood Derby on Christmas Eve." Why did you say that your dad would be coming? - It's a dads-and-sons derby. I can't go unless he comes. - What made you think that he was gonna show up now? - Because maybe he will. Maybe he'll come back for Christmas. - I'm so sorry, honey, but that's just... that's not gonna happen. I just think maybe he's just really, really busy. - You don't know that. Maybe we'll get lucky. - Max... Um, did you finish packing for Ben's? What's wrong? - Last time I went to Ben's, his dad asked me what my dad did. - And what did you say? - That he's an astronaut. [She laughs] - OK, I like that. Or, the next time someone asks you what your dad does, you could say he's a magician...he's got a great disappearing act. - That's a good one. - Right? All right, let's go. You're gonna have fun tonight. OK? All right, I'll help you pack. [Man coughing] [Coughing] - One little fire, and the insurance company ups our premiums by 50 grand? - We're lucky they didn't cancel us. And they want it up front. You got 50 grand? I don't. We might have had it if you didn't burn down the house. - I'm sorry. - Dad didn't hand me the company so I could run it to the ground. What am I gonna tell him? - Look, why don't you just let me try and bring him some outside business? - Oh, please. Don't give me that green crap right now... - It's not crap, Bob! It's the future. It's a pre-fab modular kit will all recycled materials. - We build houses out of wood and nails. That's what we've always done. It was good enough for Dad and Gramps. It's good enough for us. - I'm just saying, people are looking for other options. - People are looking for someone to build their homes, not burn them down! [Coughing] - Are you catching a cold? - I think so. - Try these. It's homeopathic. Just put a few under your tongue and let them dissolve. - I should fire you and your dufus friend. But I need the manpower, so I'm just gonna fire Joe. - You can't fire Joe! Come on. You know he's going through a rough time. - When isn't he? - Fine, I'll take care of Joe, all right? And we'll get the house back on track by Christmas. - And the 50 grand? - I don't know, Bob! I don't know. I'll think of something. - And don't break your neck, 'cause the insurance won't cover it. - Don't worry! I'll be sure to break my neck off-site! - Shut the door! [Music playing inside] - Oh...

Who needs 'em? - Don't forget can't afford 'em. Max is the only guy in my life I need. - OK, I got it: no man. - No, I'm just saying, right now I need to just get my life back on track. I need to stay focused, and men just complicate things. Oh, you know what I got today? - No, what? - A "Mr. Ceroni" letter. - Well, that must have made you feel feminine. - It was from the Boy Scouts. Some sensitive jerk decided to have a father-son Christmas party. What about the boys who don't have a father? - You didn't show it to Max, did you? - Oh, Max was the one who told them his dad would love to come. That's why they sent the letter. - What have you told him? - About his dad? - Yeah. - That he moved when he was a baby; he had an important job far away. - Well, he's old enough now to hear the whole story so he doesn't romanticize it. - What am I supposed to say? "Your dad was a liar and a thief, and cleaned out our bank account, took the car, split, never to be heard from again"? - OK, maybe not in those words. Well, if it'll cheer you up, I think you got the hostess job at Marzano. They're calling you tomorrow! - Seriously? - Yes! [Laughing] - You're the best. I... I don't know what I'd do without you. - Hey, let's grab a table. - OK. - [Joe]: Who knew pillows would explode? - [Mike]: Yeah, I've never seen Bob so angry. - You should have let him fire me. - Yeah, well, if we don't get the house back on track by Christmas, he'll fire us both. - You should call your dad. Isn't he still the Big Kahuna? - No, he's retired. Plus, he hasn't returned my calls in six months. Otherwise, it's a great idea. - What? - Come on, eat your fries and let's get out of here. - I'm all over it. [Coughing] - Hi, Mike. - Hey. - This always helps me when I have a cold.

I get one percent of the payout. - It's possible someone else is playing those numbers. - OK, but what are the chances that someone else kisses the front of every ticket? - And wears Romantic Rose lipstick? It's not even a remotely attractive colour. I don't even know why I wear it. - No, no, I like it on you. - You do? - I'm sorry, but without the ticket you can't collect. - But what am I supposed to do? - Find the ticket.

Holly's car was stolen last night outside Bo Ding's Bar and Grill, but the thieves got more than they bargained for, because there's a winning lottery ticket inside the car... a ticket worth $1 million. - The ticket was bought at Vijay's Mini-Mart on Winston Street. - You must be devastated. - Devastated?

We've already burnt down a house and stolen a car. All right, why not add robbery and fraud to the list of charges? At this rate, we're gonna be on death row by the end of next week. - Come on, Mikey! We're talking about $1 million here. - But it's not ours.

Offer a reward, right? - She didn't lose it; we stole it. - OK, well, just, just put that aside for a sec. Hey, she got her car back, didn't she? And she'll get her ticket back. All she's gotta do is put up a small reward...say, 60 grand...just enough to cover the insurance and a few... electronic necessities? - Yeah, and who's gonna convince her to offer this "reward"?

I haven't really had that much time for dreaming. - How come? - Well, I went away to grad school instead of staying in the family business. I always wanted to be an architect. So I got my degree, moved to Chicago to start my own business, but, before I could get it off the ground, My father had some health problems, and he had to retire last year, so my brother needed some backup. I came home to help out. - Ah. The good son. - Mmm... I'm not so sure my brother would agree with you.

It's creating new houses with all all-green strategies. - Oh, that sounds great. - Yeah. - So, why not use your ideas in the family business? - Well, my brother believes in doing everything the old-fashioned way.

I mean, Dad didn't even return any of my calls. - He felt rejected when you left the business for grad school. - And why are you telling me this now? - So you understand.
