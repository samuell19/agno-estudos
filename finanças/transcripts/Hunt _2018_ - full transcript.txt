HUNT -- Subs OCR'ed and corrected by darthfrede -- What are you listening to? Come on, let's go for a walk. What do you think you're doing? You won't get rid of us. Take off your clothes. Fucking homos. Get him! Okay, we'll undress. Come on! Do you think I have all day? Come on! All of it. Get closer. Closer! Kiss. Are you fucking deaf? Come on! Damn. Gays! Oh, yeah... Disgusting. Do it again. You think I'm fucking with you? French kiss! With tongue! Get your tongue out, for fuck sake! What the hell? Hey. Hey! Are you okay? I should have made the dog chase them! You're the son of Magnhild and Jostein, aren't you? - And you're the son of Solveig? - Yes. This is Ronja. - Do you like animals? - Yes, but it depends on the animal. When will you be back? On Sunday! Get in here if you have something to tell me. I can't stand the yelling. I'll be back on Sunday. But I'm going back to Kjell on Monday after school. Okay. Yes, and I will be helping out with the lambing... - Hello! - Hi! - Put this on and come inside the barn. - What? Put this on! Hurry up! Look. - Should I remove the mucus? - Yes, watch me. Do you think she was in pain? Yes, maybe. You can turn the light off at 8:00 PM. Hopefully there will be no lambing in the middle of the night. And you have to check every two hours that everything is fine. And I'll call you if one of the sheep begins to cry. Bleats. Well, look who's here. Flirting with the girls, eh? Thought you were gay? - Take off his pants. - No, please! Shut up! Here are your boyfriend's pants. Get in. - Idiot. - What? Are you going to sleep now? Open your eyes. Can you see better now? Just curious about something. Did you move? I asked you a question. Show me some respect! - Did you move in with your farmer friend? - No. - Isn't he too old for you? - He is fucking old. Do you know what I think? I think you guys are perfect for each other. What are you doing? - I'm getting off the bus. - No, you are not. - I'm getting off! - Shut up. - Stop the bus, please! - Where do you think you are going? - Take your queer bag and piss off! - To your sixty-year-old boyfriend. - Are you going to ?sgrend? - Yes... - Why isn't Kjell driving you? - It's not necessary. - Get in the car. - No it's fine, my bus is coming soon. Get in. I'm going the same direction anyway. Put on your seat-belt. Aren't you Solveig's son? What was your name again? Asgaut... - My name is Svein. - Yeah. I live on the innermost farm in ?sgrend. - Do you like Kjell? - Yes, it is nice to work with Kjell. I've known Kjell since he was just a little boy. He is a good guy. Hi, Kjell! Hi! There's a sheep giving birth right now! Put your hand inside and see if you can feel two legs and one mouth. Come on. You're doing fine. I can feel a mouth! Oh, my arm slipped out. Yes! What's the deal with the green hair? What's the deal with the red beard? - Don't you like it? - Sure. Just not quite my style. The tap doesn't work. Oh, damn water pump. - God damn it's cold. - Ooh, so cold. Come on then! Three... Two... One! - How is the water? - Yeah right! Come on! Hi, Kjell! Hi, Asgaut! - That looks really cold. - No, it's not that cold. Are you taking a break from work? Yes. - I saw your mother at the store today. - Yes... It was nice to see her up and about. And you Asgaut? Are you doing alright? Yes. Well, that's good to hear. So... We better move on... Say hello to your mother. Sure. - Good bye! - Bye! Yep. I can do both. Get back in the car. Get in. Now I get why your hair is so green. - Are you going to Kjell? - Yes. Get in! Seat-belt, please. Are we not going to Kjell? Well, I just need to do some errands first. What is it? You know what very well. You can either sit still... and do this quietly... or I will make you. Relax, don't worry. It's nothing to be scared of. Just relax. Don't be scared. Look at me. Don't be scared. It's nothing to worry about. Asgaut... Listen. If you tell anyone... everyone will know... what a little whore you are. Just so you know. Why aren't you in the barn? What's going on? Is it the kids from school? Can't you tell me what happened? Fine. Can you please tell me what happened? It will be between you and me. No, it will be between you, me... and everyone else. Then everyone will know... what a little whore I am. Fuck... Svein. That fucking Svein. Oh, damn... You... You can't stay here anymore. You and me being friends in this village... People talk. They talk! - Leave. - You can't make me. - Leave now. - No! No! No! No! I'm not leaving! No! I'm sorry! Let me in! Let me in!
