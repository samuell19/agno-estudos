You've had children with four different women. Why her? Why did it absolutely have to be her that you beat up on? I never touched her, I swear. It's been six years... But you sent texts: "You're mine. You're so and so." Texts, yeah. But hitting her... In six years, I've never touched her. She never cheated on me, I never wanted... I never wanted to because... I never raised a hand to her. - I swear. - It would be unworthy of you. - Honestly... - I would be very disappointed. I'd never do that to a woman. I wouldn't. Not your style? I have children with other women... But stabbing her, I bet you could do that. No. Honestly. Look, we know each other. I trust you. But don't take advantage. No. I know. - You swear? - Yes. No more texts... Try to control yourself. I want nothing to do with her. You're too old for this, if you want my opinion... I'm trying. My wife said so, too. She said: "Come home. We have the kids, the restaurant, it's OK." I get it that you still want to put some notches in your belt. Men rarely give up on the idea of putting a few more notches in their belts. You don't contest that I can issue an arrest warrant? Counsel has nothing to add either. OK, then, we agree. Am I...? You're free to go. I thought you understood. No... - You didn't understand? - I'm sorry. That's very nice, ma'am. I don't shake hands with scoundrels! Come on. We're like family... What if I sent you back to jail. Would you shake my hand? Why not? If I was guilty. That's over with. It's nice when satisfied customers come back. When they feel at home. Did you send many to prison? Hardly. First I had... Mr. Muklija. A long-time customer who was back for something new. And you let him go? Yep. - Oh, come on! - Yes, I let him go. What'd he do? He harassed, and threatened, and annoyed the missus a bit. Pretty much run of the mill from an Albanian. So, you'll have to raid him tonight. - Pardon me? - You'll have to raid him. - Why? - He's gonna kill her. No, he's not the type. He promised he wouldn't go near her. Oh, how sweet! And I believe him. He won't touch her. He'll pay someone else to! He didn't lie. He won't hurt her! - Not personally! - Nope, not him. There you go. And stop trembling! SO HELP ME GOD Hold on a minute. What? I've got your files. - Is that all? - There were only two boxes. - What? - Only two files. Are those the two? Because he said... Wait a minute. - Right. I thought there wasn't much. - No, just two files. - You're sure this is it? - Certain. - Very sure? - Absolutely. OK, thank you. Perfect. You can have a candy. - Thanks. - They're over there. Seriously, you can really take one. Thank you. Have a good day. Great. Have a good day, and a good weekend. Maybe there's a picture of me from 20 years ago. Here's the autopsy... But she was stabbed, not strangled. Both blondes, you'll notice. She's a little more red than blonde. One minute, one minute... Was she raped? Good question. With a streetwalker, how do you know if she was raped? - Her too? - Of course. Actually, it was on this case that I learned you can have - brace yourself - an "accommodating anus". It's the same for hymens: an "accommodating hymen". A hymen or an anus that allows an erect penis to pass without deflowering, in the case of a hymen, or without tearing, in the case of an anus. I learned all that back then. I didn't know... Both of them toothless. Useful for giving velveteen rubs. It's horrible, I'm disgusting. A velveteen rub is a blow job with a toothless mouth. Quite logically. She was completely naked. And there was a used condom. Maybe that's the one we should re-examine. I don't know, I'll have to see. Used condom, because it's perfectly... Hold on. Right! What she did was try... She did this to try to keep from being strangled, and the guy was on her back strangling her. She's curled up in the fetal position. She's dead. Being dead never looks very nice. But she wasn't unattractive. She was a sweet girl. We won't find anything under there. Crap, there's always a ton. Damn! At least I can pull these weeds. And these, and these. Surprise, here you are! Look at that! So, what do we have here? We have... Nicole Nart, age 50. Yolanda Stahl, age 50. They know each other. They both walk the streets in the Avenue Louise neighborhood. Both apartments are painted pink and blue, if I'm not mistaken. One minute... It starts with Yolanda being attacked. Then Nicole is killed. Then Yolanda is killed. All that in a lapse of... a month and a half or two months. These cases have never stopped upsetting me. These two ladies both receive clients in their homes but hustle in the streets. They probably have some johns in common. That seems obvious. My personal principle: having already worked cold cases, the murderer is in the file. - You'll give them back, right? - I'll treasure them. A person gets fond of them. Careful, they're not tied up. We do get attached. It's stupid, isn't it. But I agree. We have to read them separately... Yeah, we've got to read them. Read every word. - When she was working... - She didn't wear panties. She has knife wounds on her legs, too. And the comb is also bloody, the big comb next to her, with broken teeth. The friend, Frédéric Dierckx... You know how much he paid per trick? 5,000 francs? I saw one in the... From 25,000 to 100,000 Belgian francs per trick. - Per trick? - Per trick! What did she do for 25,000? The guy was broke. - 25,000 per trick? - He had no money left to see her. He couldn't pay her anymore. He went to the other one, too. She was much nicer. Only 3,000. There's another prostitute who knew Yolanda Stahl. She said: "That guy actually gave her 300,000 francs." He said 100,000 but it was 300,000. - Right... in total. - No, in one lump sum. Because Yolanda, the victim, told him: "If you want to prove you love me, give me 300,000." He showed up with it the next day. In the end he said, after fighting with the victim: "I'll get it back one way or another." I don't get why we didn't check him out more. When a guy says that, it means... It's true he was a policeman. Think how it was 20 years ago... He's dead. Shit. Unbelievable that he died two weeks ago! Then one day he told that other woman, the one he saw for 5,000 a trick: "He told me he put his gun to Yolanda's head "and said he'd get her sooner or later." The evidence is serious, which means I have proof that you've committed at least 5 attacks on women at ATMs. What can we possibly do with you? It's not like I want to get you killed. You'll kill yourself if you don't straighten up. It's not my goal for you to die like a dog, and it's a bad deal for society, too. I've done the math: Prison costs 150 euros a day. So 150 times 20 times 365. It's a fortune. If you get out in ten years, for example, and it all goes south, well, you'll end up dead. No big deal. There'll be an autopsy, which costs about 1,000 euros. You know what an autopsy is, right? 1,000 isn't much, so that's OK. But if you keep living after prison, that costs a fortune, obviously. Because you'll be on welfare, right? Because when you're 50, and you get out after 15 years, you'll pretty much be a wreck. Am I right? You know what you were like when you got out. So, a wife and kids, forget it. You won't even be capable of having kids, if you get my meaning. It's not that easy. It's cheapest if you die right away. But that's not the point. We agree on that. I wouldn't have killed... exhausted myself writing this all up for you to die right away. If you plan to die right away, I'd prefer you tell me. At least that way I won't wear myself out for you. So the problem is having a guy who scares me. Because I can't control you. So if tomorrow I let you go, and you attack another old lady, it's my face you'll see in the papers. "This Stupid Bitch Let a Dangerous Guy Go" You'll have proven you should be locked up for life. This is what I wrote: "The examining magistrate is concerned "about your chances of rehabilitation "after so much recidivism." So I said: "The branches of this tree..." which is you, and that will flower in spring... Like the cherry trees in Japan, the pink flowers, you know? No, but I... Anyway, you know trees in spring, with new leaves, they turn green and smell good, etc. So I said, and this is you: "Your dream is for that tree "to be able to take another tree by the hand "and make little trees." - Yes or no? - Yes. If I was convinced that we can't do anything with you... I've got other customers. You'll meet them in Forest prison. I can help other people. But I chose you. But if you slip up, if you betray me, I swear that the wrath of Allah is nothing compared to mine. Because mine's not when you're dead. It's right away. - You stop for a red light? - Not necessarily, ma'am. - You don't have a little siren, do you? - I do. So?... No? Of course. Hello, it's us! Just a little, or else we'll... I hate being bored stiff. I understand perfectly! And the little privileges... I find we don't have... We don't get enough of the little extras of the job. True, isn't it? - Shall I grant you two minutes? - Oh, no. - Oh, yes! - I can't do that. What do you mean? We can do anything we want! Napoleon said the examining magistrate had the most powerful role in the Empire. Let's give them a demonstration. "Move aside, groveling masses! Here we come!" I love it. Move over, idiot. A woman. Good store, Hayoit. Excellent reputation. I had a dead body there. If we had to list all the bodies... I experience Brussels by inventorying the dead. I had serious damage by a tenant there. When I was on the bench. There was... a pet store there where I saw a cobra devour a mouse. It was awful. Really. I have very good or very bad news, ma'am. - The infamous Dierckx... - He's dead! - He died two weeks ago, ma'am. - The bastard! He did it on purpose. You said it! He probably did it on purpose. - The revolting creep, dead. Fredo... - That's the truth. Nuts, isn't it? I love it. It's hot down here. I've never looked so hard for a condom. Let's take them upstairs, otherwise we'll... We can look here, but dropping something would be stupid, since we're looking for DNA. We'll take them upstairs. Up we go. And I can show you the priest's hand. Have you seen it? It's upstairs. It's the mascot. Horrible. The story... The mascot of the Clerk's office. The priest died, and on his hand they found a license plate number. To preserve the number, they cut off the priest's hand. It lived - if I dare say - for God knows how long in the fridge. When you opened the freezer, which any bumpkin could do, the priest's hand was there. Not even wrapped? The priest's hand. In public view, frozen in the freezer. A bit like a pig's trotter. We're lucky he wrote it on his hand! - It's a nice-looking paw... - When was it? 1994. 20 years ago. The same year as Nart and Stahl. Practically the same age. Let's unwrap our presents. Drum roll. Drum roll. - Shit, already. Do you see why? - It's a plastic bag. - It was a nice start... - What is it? A ruffle from a skirt. - You can open it. - Do you want a knife? The gentleman will bring one. Here you are. No funny stuff, OK? No spitting on it, alright? Do we have another bag to put it in? We'll put it in the envelope. Show me. - That's it. - It's the one. This is from Stahl's place? This is the Stahl case, kids. Look, the comb. That's interesting. - The comb from the Stahl scene. - Maybe she defended herself with it. - She may have touched her... - Her attacker? Everything is wrapped in plastic. - That sucks, we all agree. - Well, at the time... The good news is the scarf. The scarf is very good news. And the comb, we agree. The perpetrators left behind at the scene a ski mask and a gym bag containing, among other things, some gloves, a mask, zip ties, tape, and firearm parts. Someone that I imagine you know recognized you in those pictures, which is why we requested a DNA sample. It was asked of you on the 5th of February by these gentlemen from the police, and you refused. - Anything's possible these days. - It's your right. I have mine. Anything can happen nowadays, Your Honor. People can have your DNA and use it in another case. It's possible. So the DNA is yours? No, I'm innocent. I'm completely innocent, and I don't want to give the DNA. Except if... If it's the law that I have to give my DNA, then I'll give it. If you show me the law, Your Honor, I give it, no problem. May I ask a question, please? The DNA, do I have to give it? Or is it my right not to? You can say no, of course, and then I order that it be taken. If we have to hold you down, we will. You'll come after me for it? I'll tackle you and take it. End of story. Is that a threat? Absolutely not. It's just the terms of the law. However, with regard to you, I find you're becoming a bit rude. - No, Your Honor, not at all. - It's no big deal! It's an obligation to give the DNA? It's not an obligation. - I am allowed not to give it today? - If you refuse, we'll hold you down and open your mouth. Right away. Of course! Who will hold me down? There are enough of these gentlemen to handle it. It won't be me, OK? - OK, Your Honor. - But I will watch. And allow me to tell you, Mr. Moammadih, that I may not look it, but I've trained in self-defense and I'm perfectly capable of throwing you down myself. - If you want a demonstration... - You're a woman, Your Honor. - I can't... - But first you'll be knocked out. Because first I'll knock you out, then I'll hold you down. - It's very simple. - You're right, Your Honor. - You do sport? - I won't say how, but take my word. What sports do you do? If I can ask. Yoga. This is your statement. Sign each page, next to my signature. - Of course. - You'll have your own copy soon. It's a lovely name, Anne. Madame Anne. A very nice name. So, I examined the skirt first. I examined it under white light and under Polilight. I was looking not only for traces of blood from a possible struggle, but especially traces of semen. But I obtained no usable genetic profile. I then examined the comb and the tooth. I also undertook tests for blood. All negative. So for the two cases, with the two different victims, we obtain from the used condom found in the home of Yolanda Stahl the genetic profile of Man 3. We find it again from two condoms removed - from the home of Nicole Nart. - So they had one john in common. Which makes sense since they had the same profile. So, who knew both victims? Gérard Lambot. Alvarez is also possible, because his schedule... It's José Alvarez, I think. The timing of his whereabouts was... He said: "No, since my wife..." He was married at the time and had just had a child. "Since my wife gave birth," or "Since I got married, no, never." But that's not true. And then there's the third one, "MacGregor". - What? - Carmaron? Gordon Carmaron? He's a nice guy, too, since he always maintained that he didn't know Yolanda Stahl, which is not true! I think those are the three we should start with. Though of course we could have a fourth, if we have it, Freddy the cop. So I'll look at the samples and send you a draft brief. If they no longer have the samples you'll have to find these people to take new samples. Well, indeed! There isn't one, there are two! They're spoiling us. Great, there are two. It's horrible... How long do they keep them? Disgusting... They probably don't have fridges. - Are you holding up? - Yes. - You've never seen that? - No. - This is a picture. I've seen it live. - How awful. Nothing that is human can disgust me, sayeth the Lord. Well... Gustave... Helped by Kamal. He'll see how much Gustave withdraws. Kamal... He takes Gustave's money, shoves Gustave. The woman intervenes. Kamal shoves Gustave. Leaves, threatening her. But it so happens that the fine Gustave is currently in the hospital. So, what's of interest to us now is perhaps the story of this aged gentleman, 84 years old. Can I see those pictures? I explained it to my lawyer. - I do not remember that thing. - Is it you or not? It's me in the picture, but I'm not grabbing. I have an account there, too. I'm not grabbing anything. I haven't seen the witness statements. - Hold on... - Don't fuck around! In these pictures we see someone. It's me. I have an ATM card, too. Who is obviously grabbing the gentleman's money and shoving him. If I grabbed it, it can only be me. It's what the gentleman says, and the lady with her headscarf. Then it's me. That's it. Do you have a good reason not to remember? - Valium and methadone. - Pardon me? And I won't deny I sometimes smoke hash. It doesn't make a good mix. Tell me, how much hash do you consume each day? Hash? I smoke two joints. Maybe 3 or 4 joints a day. It calms me down. - "I used to smoke." - Sorry? "I used to smoke, not anymore." At least I presume. The gentleman still smokes, Counsel. - He told me: "I used to smoke." - I used to smoke. Rarely now. Since I started community service, I started to stop. - How long were you in prison? - 24 years, Your Honor. - In prison. - All together, yes. - 24 years. In how many times? - 14 years, in several parts. And in one go, first the three months, then 10 years, 3 months, and 10 days. - A morals charge here in Brussels. - Morals? - How many years did you get? - Eight. Eight years. - It's what I said, ten years in one go. - What did you do? I didn't realize. I broke in and robbed him. Unfortunately, he was in a wheelchair. It was spineless of me. We broke in, and I locked him in the bathroom. I stole his jewelry, I took his Mistercash card to the bank. I left him locked up. I withdrew 500 euros. Less than 500, to go buy cocaine. I was really hooked. I came back and untied him, I took him with me to Saint-Gilles, since my sister lived near Saint-Gilles. And I let him go. That's all. Then he told some passerby: "That man robbed me." Everyone thought he was crazy, but he wasn't. It was true, I did it. Did you rape him, too? - He added sodomy four months later! - It's what he said. Several months after the fact. I defended him, but he got eight years. I've stopped messing up. I've done nothing since. Please, Your Honor. I beg you, don't send me to jail. You shoved an 84-year-old guy who may end up dying. I cannot! Then he'll plead his case in court. What does Counsel have to say? This'll be pretty. I'll take respon... I say: "And if Gustave dies?" And Counsel says? I say that the events were 8 months ago, and the gentleman seems, as of today, not to be suffering too many after-effects. But I don't have any reports here. - "And the gentleman seems..." - Still alive. - "Still alive." - Well, yes. The question is: I don't know what else you've done. - Nothing else. - I'm waiting to see. If you put me in jail, I lose my apartment. The housing office helped me find it. Please, don't ruin everything for me. I just got 15 months of work, a good job. If I go to jail, I lose everything. Please, Your Honor. I beg you. I promise you'll never hear another word about me. Please. Please. I'm asking, not Ms. Toussaint. It's me. I know I disappointed Ms. Toussaint. She chewed me out. I accept that. But I won't get out of line again, I promise. We have to weigh the pros and cons. The facts are terrible. But they occurred back on April 6th. April 15th. This is a turning point, the apartment. You have to understand me, too... Shut up! Eat and drink. Actually, I agree with you. The problem for me is... - Don't pay attention to me. - Eat! My problem is that I'm not Saint Rita, Patroness of Impossible Causes. - Why is this coming out now? - What? The pictures are very recognizable. Everybody knows him, he's easy to find. He's at the probation office with Ms. Maerschout all the time. I know. What I don't know... You shut up! What I don't know is if there are other crimes. It'll hit him then, as new elements... You can arrest him then. Stop swearing already. Just eat! - And shut up! - OK. He's done half of his community service already. 600 hours, you know? Delivered by the court of appeal. We've got to give it a try. - Where he's come from? - Please, Your Honor. It's not like he'll do anything in the next three days. If he does anything, he'll throw himself under a train. - Shut your face for two minutes! - I'm sorry. I can have my money, I hope? It won't help you in Forest prison. If you have another stupid question... I'm going to Forest now? - Hold on while we decide. - Wait outside the door! You give them an inch... I understand that it's a package. Can you get a parole form? I've put up with him for ten years... Ten years? He spent them in jail! I wouldn't be proud if I were you. I did my best with what I had. Are you OK, my little pet? Not easy, is it? Tell me if it's too much. You're such a nice little car. Nice. Very good. Just think about these girls. First, they're in the streets whatever the weather. And then, pardon me, but I don't know if you can imagine, the guys aren't always that clean. No, I mean I admire these girls who fuck and suck things that don't always smell that nice. I think they're very courageous. I think they have a lot of courage. And they really deserve the money they earn. What we did was to ask Crime Analysis to re-read the whole file. In the Nicole Nart half, he fingered Gérard Lambot, who is someone who's... - The gay friend? - He's the gay friend. He was quite rightly interviewed at the time as the guy who discovered the body, the friend. - He got money out of her? - She did support him a little. - Exactly. - Which is bizarre, since he's... He's gay, but they had a relationship... - They were together sometimes. - At his request, apparently. But the relationship was peculiar. According to other prostitutes who were interviewed, he once had a fight with Nicole Nart that was quite violent. It doesn't make him the perfect suspect. But he remains a potential suspect we have to look into. He's still alive. - Lambot's in limbo! - I didn't want to say it... I did it for you! We won't have much trouble getting his DNA. Take his dentures. Lambot's whole dentures. Lambot? Does he have dentures? - I bet my bucks he does. - Really? You wanna bet? You usually win... We can take something else! Well, anyway... It's just to get... Or his drawers! Right. - Nice and fresh. - Lots of fun. It'd be more discreet. How many days How many nights How long has it been Since you took flight You told me this time It's the final traverse For our tattered hearts It's the final collapse In spring you will see I'll be back from afar Spring is so lovely For talking of love We'll go see together The flowers in bloom And stroll arm in arm Through Paris streets soon It was a great moment. I show up and see the director, a tiny woman... She wasn't very receptive: "Well, he's very sick, "he doesn't remember anything. "Perhaps a doctor should accompany you?" I told her it's just a DNA sample. He only needs to understand and sign... "Can I see the warrant?" Really suspicious. So she looked, and said: "You won't be able to talk to him. "He doesn't remember what he had for lunch." - He's a goner. - Apparently. He's not old, but he has no memory at all. I told him: "I'm here about an old case, "an event that dates to the early 90s, "involving Nicole Nart." He said: "Yes, my friend who died. "I found her. She had a sheet over her, and I removed it." The guy remembered every detail. The woman from the home was slack-jawed. - He grasped the situation? - Yes, he did. He asked why we're investigating now. So I explained... - He understands... - He understands everything. He said her death really affected him, that she was a close friend. He knows there was another death. - Another prostitute. - He remembers that. Less well. But for Nart, he recalled every detail. That her teeth were broken... Everything. - A present from Santa Claus. - Thanks. - Did you label the DNA? - I did. - Suspect, thanks. - And this if you need it. It's useless. - So, andiamo? - Andiamo la musica. Was the burglary you or not? Nothing to do with me. Me rob a house all alone? I don't know. No, not that. To look at you, I wouldn't necessarily know that you're a bondage and S&M specialist. We agree, right? We're not always dressed in latex. Is it an age thing? - Sorry? - Is it because of age? What age? I just know that ladies start with normal prostitution and when they reach a certain age, they move on to more specialized practices to be able to continue. - Exactly. - OK. That's how it works. Also because I make more money without really having sex with the clients, basically. BDSM is like that. Not everyone wants intercourse. What do they want? Fetishism, nursing, prostate massage. Prostate massage? You learned where it is, and how to touch it? For that, I'm grateful to a 50-year-old Belgian lady. She taught me how it works. To get out of the actual sex, basically. - Out of what? - Sex, you could say. - Before, it was just fucking. - Yes. Now it's manipulation, you beat someone, touch his prostate, stuff like that... - Because they ask, and pay for it. - Claro hombre, it's magic. How much does a prostate massage cost? It depends. 150 an hour. But that's from... He might take 2, 3, 4, 5 hours. A submissive man doesn't want just an hour. - Daily would be 900. - What do you do for that price? - Stuff! - A little of everything? Sometimes they just like to be locked up in a place. So we lock him up in like a cage or a box, you lock him up somewhere, and let him freeze. They like that. Or we slap them around. They like that. Do you clean house at the same time? That's what I'd do. Some submissives like cleaning house, and stuff. - The dishes? - Yes, when I had my apartment. They pay you to do your dishes? - That's very interesting. - Yes, ma'am. - But they're naked, or with an apron. - Like a housemaid. Yes, I know the type. I can imagine. I'm happy with 3 or 4 clients a week. How many different kinds in all? Me, in a day, I can have a dozen different clients. There's sometimes bondage, but only when the police put the handcuffs on. - It's not bondage, just handcuffs. - But they like that! - What? - Some come with their own handcuffs. - I'm not surprised. - And who come with a product, with suppositories. Glycerin? For going to the bathroom, you mean? Or Tylenol suppositories. There are submissives who like us to insert them. I give them the whole box. A whole box of suppositories? My pet, did you know people do things like that? Not at all. Nope. Me neither. You give them a whole box of suppositories? Hold on. But... OK, we understand. I have an idea... They're little suppositories. There's some sadistic stuff. Yeah, sadistic stuff. - For example when you... - What? You take a man's penis. And you tie it, do bondage on his penis. Until it gets all red, and you take a pin. And you prick all over his penis. Especially the tip. The foreskin, it's called. - Sorry? - The foreskin. Sorry, my French isn't perfect. Not a problem. You don't prick so that they scream with pain. You prick so that it hurts, but good, and there's a little blood, just a tiny bit. - Then you take alcohol, and pour it on. - Alcohol? Rubbing alcohol, from the pharmacy, for injuries. And "Aaaaahhhh." They like it. Stuff like that, or... Hold on. "Ah", they like it. It's pain that feels good. How I would know, I don't have the wherewithal to do that. - Me neither. - So they like it, fine. - And then they ejaculate? - Yeah, it makes them ejaculate. It just comes out. I don't have to do anything, not even my... Nothing. It's fantastic. I didn't know all that. Instead of being a judge, you should have been a mistress! Instead of a judge, you should have been a mistress. Well... I'm not sure... You'd see stuff worse than that, ma'am. - Eating their... - Coprophagia! But eating, not just spread all over. - Yummy. - Not yummy. Not at all! - Thank you, Your Honor. - Do you have your phone? I've got everything. Thank you very much. Good-bye. She's a nice girl. Don't you think? I think she's a good girl. I liked her. She's pretty healthy. I'd say she's quite well-balanced. It's funny! We learn stuff. The thing with the pin... You use it like a toothbrush on your gums and you rub your gums with the little piece of cotton. - Is this enough? - It's perfect, Mr. Alvarez. Nicole Nart and Yolanda Stahl: do you remember them? No, sir. I said I did at the time. I won't say otherwise. It was the milieu I spent time in back then. - Yes. - It's in my record. You had contact with one of the prostitutes, Nicole Nart, I believe. But not regularly. You probably saw her several times, but afterwards, you set a mailbox in the building on fire, and it was hers. So we reasonably presume that... Indeed. - ...there's a connection. - Vengeance or something. Not at all, I never had problems with that person, or those persons, in relationship to me. Frankly, it's pure coincidence. - It's not a fluke that you set fire... - It was her, the fire? - Exactly. - Ah, OK. At the two crime scenes, there were condoms. In the condoms that were found, there is a possibility that your DNA was found. So the judge asked us, since the techniques have evolved since then, to get a new DNA sample from you in order to check again, and confirm or eliminate that it was your DNA. What do you think? Honestly? The problem is... He regrets something, I think. He did set fire to a prostitute's mailbox. - There were several charges. - Exactly. Indecent assault, rape, arson... Six in all. All of them against prostitutes. But his alibi at the time... OK, he was at the hospital for the birth. No one ever stays at the maternity ward... It doesn't change a thing! His alibi for those hours doesn't mean he wasn't elsewhere later. I can have you arrested. I can send you to prison immediately for having hit the mother of your child yesterday. - I didn't hit her. - Pardon? You say you didn't hit her, but that's not very credible. You said two things to the police that struck me. First: "I'm Turkish, and that's how we are. "I want to know what she does and who she has contact with." I'd like to understand. Because I don't understand. I just said that, in our culture, we can... - Where were you born, sir? - In Belgium. - Are you Belgian or Turkish? - I'm Belgian. - So what is your culture? - Belgian-Turkish. - I live on both sides, Your Honor. - You live on both sides, sir, except that you've chosen one. What you call your culture is not compatible with the way of life you're in now, meaning in Belgium. - Do you understand that? - Yes. So I don't need to hear about your culture, or your claims to it. What kind of thinking is that? If I understand, it's racism? - Your Honor, I don't... - Don't "Your Honor" me. I'm saying: "Yes, it's racism." What kind of thinking is it, to say: "In our culture, we keep a watch on women." - What does that mean? - I didn't say that. It's written here: "I watch her." - Maybe it was... - Counsel, I did not ask you to speak. The illnesses, AIDS... She should know... Please, that's inappropriate. If you want a private conversation with your client, please leave. But not in my office. I find it particularly impolite. Now I'm listening. What did you want to say about your mentality? Your Honor, I just wanted to say... If you're in a couple with someone, she shouldn't still have a private life, hiding with her cell phone so I can't go see what she's doing. Of course. By what right do you go looking through her phone? - By what right? - It's a long story, Your Honor... It's not a long story, it's by what right? So, let's hear it. Hold on, I'll close the door, in case there's someone listening. Hi, how's it going? I'll ask the questions, OK? One: Have we found anyone? We obtained two samples. I also compared the results obtained from both files. And I obtained no correspondence. - Neither one nor the other. - No. So it's not Alvarez or Lambot. In any case, I find no traces in either of the files. Of the four suspects you indicated, these two samples were easiest to get. Still alive and in Belgium. The problem is that Dierckx is dead, and Carmaron... is who knows where. Exactly. Shit. So we take the next steps. The next step... is to exhume Dierckx. It's the easiest. If he didn't have children and his parents are... But he hasn't been dead long. - Getting a bone is no problem. - What? Digging up part of the skeleton, a bone... Or a kidney? Kidneys are often in good condition. I had a guy exhumed after ten years and the kidneys were impeccable. - A kidney would be good. - It would. Kidneys, how tasty. Do you think a guy who kills two women, practically one after the other... ...doesn't commit any other crimes? We're missing the third one. Pardon me? I'm no investigator or criminologist, but I... No, it's the first one that's hard. It's the first death that's hard. It's true. And here I am without... Well, yeah. We moved forward, we hoped, and the hope was in vain. So it bums me out, on top of the crummy weather. If it's just about the weather! Inspector Slavic here. It's Anne Gruwez here. Am I disturbing you? - No, Your Honor. How are you? - Fine. No, actually, not fine. It's neither one nor the other. Not Lambot, not Alvarez. That is bad news, then. Very bad. I was really hopeful. And then this. We all were. Except for Alvarez, it's what I thought: a guy who forgets, and comes right away to say: "I forgot everything from back then." - That's not a guy... - Yeah, it's bizarre. That's not a guy who's killed. Certainly not a guy who's killed twice. Where are you? - At the canal. We caught a floater. - Sorry? - A body in the canal. - Gimme the details. It's a man who was probably depressed and who took the big dive. We're waiting on Mr. de Sauvage. - And where is it at the canal? - Quai des Péniches. I know it. I should be a taxi driver in my next life. I know it. - Is he fresh or up from the bottom? - Oh, no. Not fresh. There are shrimps all over. That's disgusting! - No, he's not fresh. - Don't touch it. I did five years for drugs. Breaking into cars and all that. This isn't gonna take long. You have the hammer, take my prints, and that's it. If my prints are on it, I'll shut my trap, and take me back to jail. OK? We do like that? I wanted to get out of Belgium. You won't see my ugly mug in front of you. In Belgium here. How's that? Start picking us up for no reason... I asked if you confirm the declaration to the police. You said: "You talk about this guy, but I don't know him." Mr. Abdellah. "In Ghent they ordered me to leave the country. "I found some perfume and a Walkman, that's all. "I never saw this Mr. Abdellah, or the car that was broken into. "The police found me far away. "I was going to leave Belgium by train. "I already lost five years from 2007 to 2012. "And a cop beat me up, shouting: 'Fuck your mother.'" Can you see this? - I'm looking at my computer. - Look at this. - You have a bump. - There. I can see! Keep quiet so I can type. It is quite sizeable. I want to leave. They won't see me here again. I'm charging you with robbery and forced entry, as perpetrator or accomplice and with illegal residence. That means I think you were with Mr. Abdellah, and that you broke into the truck and the cars on Rue Fossé aux Loups. Your Honor, I don't know that man. - Well, I think the opposite. - I don't know him, you're... Do you have anything to say... You are sending an innocent man to jail for nothing. Do you have anything to say about the fact that I can send you to prison? Your Honor, I want to leave. Please let me go. Don't ruin my life, please, not even for a franc, for nothing. - So, you've told me... - Let me leave, take the train - and leave, please. - Counsel, do you have any objections to the fact that I can issue a warrant for your client's arrest? No objections. Would you take a green tissue, Counsel, from the shelf and give it to your client, please? Sign here, sir. At the bottom of each page. I went to prison at the age of 22. I got out at age 30. And you still want to ruin my life? I can't take it. Be reasonable. It's not me ruining your life. My family's waiting for me in Spain... It's that you're giving me every element required for you to ruin your own life. What elements? You can wait outside. The gentleman can wait at the door. Put the handcuffs back on. Wait by the door. The suspect is under arrest. He will be transferred to Forest prison, and will go before an interim court on Friday. Your Honor! You can send me, but I'll get out and go to Syria. Things'll really get bad now. I'll go to Syria. It's the truth. I give you my word. You're sending me back for nothing. I'll go to jail for nothing! I've got a family waiting for me. I swear before God. When I get out, I'll go to Syria. I'm not depriving anyone, I hope. I haven't had time to eat mine yet. He wasn't bad looking, either. I didn't think his mug was that ugly. It's true, he wasn't bad looking... You also thought he had an ugly mug? He said it. I shared his opinion. - I saw it, and I didn't agree. - Really? He has good features. Pretty handsome. We forgot the flowers. - Doctor, we can get started! - Let's go. - This will protect your delicate skin. - I'll get dressed first. - Mr. Slavic. How are you? - Fine, and you? This doesn't correspond to your apostille. Path 5, lawn 6. - Don't look at the path. - And look here... Here he is, Frédéric Dierckx. He's enormous. Look. But he was tall, if I remember. That thing's taller than 1m85! - They're going to pull him? - By hand. They just pull the shroud. And there's our man. He is dead, Mr. Derumier. Don't be too sentimental. They just flipped him over. - There's not much left, is there. - Nope, not much. - He looks shorter like that. - I agree. Skinnier, too. He is pretty tall, though. - Do you have your gear? - Everything I need, right here. Perfect. He's not that tall after all. He died at the hospital. Wow, we can still see... his knees. He's in good shape. - What? - He still looks good. I think so, too. Looks good... For the picture I'll reposition his teeth. For the DNA I'll take some teeth and some bone. I follow your lead. Can you take more to go with drinks, Doctor? No problem. For the appetizers. For the rest, I'll take the cover off. - Are you done with the teeth? - Yes, I took two teeth. It wasn't actually... - It smelled bad, huh? - No. - The nice little breeze was perfect. - The wind was favorable. - I was really amazed... - He was fresh. - It's like he'd been there a week. - You're exaggerating a bit. - But he looked good. - Absolutely. He was fresh. I had a client who lived there. He was nice as could be. He killed his wife, that he did. It happens, but she was a real pain in the neck. Since Carmaron shows up everywhere, and especially, you suspected him at the time. You thought it was worthwhile to go question him in the US. - In the FBI office. - What's the Chicago FBI like? Like all the Americans. They've got resources. If they work better or not, that remains to be seen. They had their car to drive us from the airport to the hotel, but it broke down. They weren't too... We had the guy come in. He looked like a little old man, a drunk. - An alcoholic. - Yes. You looked him in the eyes and what did you think? - "You, old pal..." - That he wasn't honest. We kept asking the same question: "Did you know Ms. Stahl?" He denied everything. Yolanda, when she talked to her friend Josiane, who was also a prostitute, she said: "I know the guy. I take his money." But then, after the murder, he denied knowing the victim. - Denied ever seeing her. - Exactly. So something's wrong. So, let's imagine that Carmaron murdered Yolanda, OK? But why would he have killed Nicole? First, because he was a client. He saw several girls. Though he denied during questioning having sex with some of them. He knew them. His explanation that he gave them money to help them out... I don't think he was a philanthropist. So, he went to the girls, and he got quite aggressive when he was drunk. And there's the witness who said that he got drunk and said he'd done it. That he'd killed Stahl. He's also the one who had a reason to do it. The victim was going to move to Spain. And? Without him. There was also the business that he lent her money. She'd taken a million Belgian francs from him. If she wanted to go to Spain without him, but with her previous pimp... I'm guessing that hurts. Is that his new address in the US? - The old devil's living it up! - If it's him. Having a fine old time. A Jaguar. That is a Jag, isn't it? Nice little Jaguar. An Englishman in the US has to have a Jaguar. We have his DNA? No. The sample that was supposed to be frozen thawed out. So the blood was in less than optimum condition. And to get it again... You're not gonna get it. Tricky. I'd like to hear what you have to say about the situation with Ahmed. If I understand, there was yet another altercation with the neighbor. - Yes, the same day. - Clash with the neighbors. Ahmed felt his tension rising... When he blows a fuse, he gets some air at the door, smokes a cigarette. He doesn't do anything bad. Then he drove away at top speed. - And then he... - Blowing a fuse, we say. He blew a fuse. He didn't know what he was doing. The problem was that he hit some police. If he hadn't had the car it wouldn't have happened. - Ahmed has a problem that's... - Psychological. Psychological, exactly. My first question is for you, ma'am: - How are you related to Ahmed's father? - He's her husband. Yes, I'm aware of that, thank you. I'd like to know if he's also her cousin. If the grandparents are brothers? That's exactly right. Because... How can I explain? So that's it. Have you been told that's why Ahmed is the way he is? - No, they haven't told her. - Really? Her mother, who's my grandmother, and the grandfather of my father are sister and brother. Your father's father? My father's father... My father and my husband's mother are brother and sister. That's it. Do you know that causes problems for the children? We didn't know. I only heard of it not long ago, when they showed it on TV. Something new every day! Yes, but let's try to avoid having it happen to you. - They're off to a bad start. - Don't marry your cousins. - She did it. - It'll be a disaster. - Yassine married his cousin, no? - What? - My other brother married his cousin. - Your sister's daughter? - Her brother's daughter. - Your... brother's daughter? Yes, my brother married her brother's daughter. - Did they have children? - Five. That makes... Can you imagine? The consanguinity? They thought it was good. They're both from good families... It's been known forever. We've known it for centuries. See, it's not good... - But it's normal there. - And it goes on and on. It's normal for them. They're over there... They reserve! I've seen it over there. A girl is 15, and they reserve her already. And your brother's children, how are they doing? They're a little behind in school, and they have vision problems. His daughter has... Not problems, but... She stays apart from other kids. Right. They even talked about a special school, but he didn't agree. Hold on a minute. You've got to talk about this with your family. Do you realize what a disaster it is? You have to tell everyone. It can't continue. Look at my uncle. His wife is infertile, she can't have babies. - Is she his cousin? - Not at all. - Is she a second cousin? - No. He got lucky, she can't have children. I kind of agree, but you really can't say so. Everyone has to deal with something. Like me, when my ex-wife left, the children consoled me a little, but then I got a dog to... Replace your wife? - Well, yeah. I'm alone every day. - Of course. - And it's less expensive. - I can agree. No restaurants... No movies..., No: "Let's go to H&M." No fancy clothes. We agree. But it does have a fur coat! Do you have a job? - Had a job. - So for the time being? I'm on disability since the attempted murder. At my front door. I got stabbed three times. Over a parking space. It was in the papers. How long have you been on disability? Over two years now. I'm getting psychological treatment, since I was traumatized. And what is your situation? I worked in cleaning. An office cleaner. I had a workplace accident in 2007. - What happened? - I fell while scrubbing the floor. I slipped and broke three ribs. I have tendinitis in the foot and the left hand. The wrist. And I hit my head on the wall. And since then you've been on disability? I learned this year I'm diabetic, a hereditary health problem from my parents. - What does your father do? - He was a baker. He's retired, but he has every illness in the book. Bronchitis, pneumonitis, asthma... He gets out of the hospital to go into another hospital. He has diabetes, heart problems, varicose veins, high blood pressure... - The works. - He's got everything. - And you, ma'am? - My mother? The works, too. - Heart, asthma... - She has diabetes. But diabetes is... a lack of exercise. And you're younger than me. Talk about it with other people. It's a question of keeping fit. Go to the gym, lift a few weights... Ride a bike. Play tennis, badminton... At her age? It's no excuse. The mother... she started talking very quickly and said: "I'll show you where I buried the kid." An 8-year-old kid, that she carried... In a suitcase, all the way here. She took him out, buried him, and went home with the suitcase. We haven't been to her home yet. It's a jihadi milieu. The father is in Syria. And we have a big problem on our side. Our services intervened Friday, late afternoon, at the address. A neighbor said the mother was breaking things. There was contact on site with the grandmother who said... The grandmother... The woman's mother. "My daughter has psychiatric problems. She won't talk to me." The patrol wrote it up, saying they saw nothing abnormal. "No sign of struggle. Mother normal. Children in good health." The intervention ended there, and that night, unfortunately... Is the victim an adult? A child? As for the rest, I'm an examining magistrate, so I have nothing to say, especially not to the media. Wait for Ms. Van Wymersch from the prosecutor's office. I got had. Obviously I got had. - How was she behaving? - She got all... - Aggressive. - With you? With everyone? With everyone, I think. At first I thought she was very nice. She was good with her kids. A good mother. She starts breaking things. You call the police. - Did you call? - We called her mom. Her mother never came. You informed her mother, who informed the police, but she didn't come. We've found the child. He was buried according to custom. They buried him as a Muslim. Yes. That's exactly right. With a shroud and everything? They respected everything... which is already some consolation. - He was very clean and didn't suffer. - If he's dead, ma'am, he suffered. Not for certain. No. He needs your prayers. - Is Dr. Schmit also inside? - They're working, Your Honor. I told the gentleman and his son upstairs that they mustn't let anyone in. It's confirmed, the father is in Syria. For how long? A few years. At least two years. She's been here two years and no one's seen him. "I got up at night, - "at about 4 a.m." Is that right? - Yes. And then? I could already see my son had changed a lot. "I saw a big change in my son." Is that it? - Yes? - In his expression. And his behavior. - What? - His behavior. Yes? I'm done. And I had some dreams, actually. And in one of my dreams I saw that I was being raped in a satanic ritual. In Antwerp. - Because I used to live in Antwerp. - I saw that. It was organized by Mrs. Annabelle Lebs... who is the mother of the father of my children. And? And because of the rape I got pregnant, since I had his son. I couldn't let him live... or he would spread even more evil in the world. A voice was telling me I absolutely had to kill him. That he was Iblis. - So I did my ablutions. - What? - You did your ablutions? - Yes. I prayed. And I strangled him. Since he was very difficult, and I could see he had a nature a little different from a normal human, he turned into a bizarre creature when I strangled him. And since he wasn't easy to kill, I dragged him into the kitchen. - Yes. And then? - And I got a big knife. And I stuck it in his jugular vein. That's all. And then? I took out the knife, to see the color of his blood. It was all black. Then I knew I really had killed Satan. The son of Satan, sorry. Then... I put him in my suitcase. I took him to the foot of the tree. Like magic, there was already a shovel at my door. I started digging Ibrahim's grave. At the same time I was seeing another me, who is divided in 2 or 3. One was furious, there was a voice in me that kept saying: "Why did you kill my child? You should be ashamed." So every time I struck the shovel, my left side said I should feel guilty. And my right side said I'd done something good for humanity. Were there other signs as you dug the grave? Yes, I had a lot of dreams. - While you were digging the grave? - No. Dreams I had over a long time. What were they? I saw the moon three times, split in two. When was that? In 2005. In 2005, you saw the moon three times? Not three times. In 2005, I saw it for the first time, and it split in two and fell. OK. Where did it go? It fell, and that's when I woke up. OK. - His face was weird, like a dinosaur. - What? - He looked like a lizard. - Really? - Yeah. - How, exactly? When I was tightening my scarf around his neck, he took on an appearance like... Even his legs spread out, like some kind of... lizard, or frog. But he didn't change color. No, but his blood was really black. So that proves he wasn't really a human being. And then... Hold on. And then? Then his face started to turn back into Ibrahim, the child I raised. Innocence. But really, he let out a scream that was quite... terrifying. Killing that child was an honor for me. And I'll go to prison if necessary. There's a good chance of that. That's how the law is. I don't know what I said. Someone influences me through my head. - Are we done? - That's all, Your Honor. I presume Mr. Colin has no additional questions. - No, Your Honor. Thank you. - Come over here and we'll check it. Leave her your chair and sit over there, alright? I'll show the thing to you, OK? "The son of Satan," I'll say. - "That child of Satan." - Once I saw Jesus in my dream, Judge. - Jesus? - Yes. What is he doing in all this? Hold on a minute, or else I can't follow. "I had dreams that the child of Satan wasn't a normal human but the devil." And you saw Jesus? I saw him in 2005. Or 2006. 2005, when the moon fell? Or 2006? - After the moon fell. - "After the moon had fallen." I saw the prophet Muhammad twice in my dream. - My head is about to... - Explode? - Exactly. - I understand. "I knew it..." And we'll stop. Because otherwise... - There's a bizarre force in the room... - Or you'll go crazy. - We'll be careful. Some water? - Yes, please. - Some water. Sparkling or flat? - Sparkling. Calm down, take a deep breath. Go on. - Nice and deep. Can I touch you or not? - Yes, you can. I'm touching you. Can you tell it's me? Yes. - Are you a little better? - Yeah. Let's finish up quickly, OK? - Hello! - Ladies! - Please go ahead. - It's a question of life or death. I have to eat enough sugar, because I'm exhausted, I had another murder. I'll just finish up quickly. Can we sit down? There are candies by the door. They're for sharing. - Perfect. - Are there any left? Yes, I left some. It wasn't to know if you left any but if you got any! - It's great. Perfect. - Wonderful. So tell me about Dierckx. So, we had... removed and examined the two nails, the teeth, and a piece of femur. We were able to obtain a full genetic profile, to compare to the five men in the file. Including Man 3 who matched both. We find no correspondence between the genetic profile of the exhumed man and the five men in our file. So it's a "no match". No match. Even just seeing the guy, I thought he wouldn't. He didn't have the profile, if I dare say. He was too tall. I can't explain. Sometimes there are profiles for... sexual things like that, violent ones. He didn't fit it. So, you've got news about Carmaron? We finally have a little something. We have no DNA yet, but we have located... Let's declare war on the US. Yes, we declare war. It's our only solution. - It's a recent address... - Show me? Are those the reports? This is one report. This is the second. In the end, they located him. And the guy is known in the US now. He has a police record. Hold on. These guys have the DNA. The FBI re-opened a case, yes. So he was convicted in 2002. - Shit, why? - Drunk driving. He spent ten days in jail. I asked if they took his DNA, since it's possible they'd still have it. Or at any rate the numbers. The alleles, to match up with ours. If they didn't keep the DNA, we have to ask them to take it again. But we already took Carmaron's DNA when you were there 20 years ago. If that's how it is, I'm not sure they'll reauthorize us to take a DNA sample when we explain that the one we have is spoiled. With a little luck, they'll have his allele chart. Right. And we'll get an answer from the liaison officer. And you can't say if it's one, two, or six months. No, no... - How long? - One or two weeks. - So by the end of January... - We should have an answer. - In theory we'll have an answer. - Yes. But only to say: "Yes, we have the DNA." Or: "No, we don't have the DNA." Which would then take us another year to get his DNA. More or less... We can't work miracles. Subtitles: Jennifer Gay & Harold Manning Subtitling: TITRAFILM
