No, I, uh, don't live in a fancy place like this. I do have a one-room flat. But... but at least it's clean. [door slams] I'm going to call the police. That's not the answer, Jean.

Oh, I'm sorry, Patty. I didn't mean to jump on you. It's just that-- I feel like I'm in a daze. Can I talk or should I keep my big mouth shut? Don't be silly. We'll sit over here, so when Steve comes we can see him. You should have talked to me before you got yourself in such a mess. It's not a mess, Patty. It's just not being what Steve thinks a good wife should be. Well, 17 is no age to get married at. Who needs those responsibilities anyway? You sound like my folks. It's true. From where I sit, marriage is a full-time job. I don't think a girl should even think about it until she's at least 20. Well, I'm not 20 and I'm married. Oh, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I'm happy. I guess I'm just scared. So what happens now? What do you mean? Are you going to continue to go to school and live at his apartment? Well, yes, he's my husband. Aren't you going to quit and get a job? My parents want me to finish school, and so does Steve. I think you're nuts. You know what I'd do? Since I went this far, even though it might have been a mistake, I'd go all the way. I'd quit school and get a job. So in case something happens, you'd have the money to get your own apartment. What do you mean, a mistake? I didn't say it was a mistake! And nothing's going to happen. We get along fine. You'll see. Well, you can't go to school and be a good wife at the same time. You're not playing House, you know. Patty, will you leave me alone, please? [Steve] Honey! I'll see you tomorrow. How about a kiss, huh? Not here. Where are we going? To pick up your clothes at your mother's. Do we have to? Today? We have to, today. I'm sorry you decided to do it this way, Steve. I decided it, Dad. Judy, I've decided not to do anything to break it up. So I-- well, I just hope you're doing the right thing. I'm not going to try to tell you how to run your life. It's a little late for that. However, I do insist that you finish high school and then go on to college. And if you should need any help, financial or otherwise, I'll do what I can. I'm not going to pretend that I'm overjoyed about all this or, or even that I approve. I'm only interested in what will make Judy happy. It's nothing personal, Steve. Can you understand? Yes, sir. I understand. I'll put these things in the car, Judy. Thank you, Daddy. [door closes] I don't understand you. Again you let her go out that door without lifting a finger. If you'd just listened to me, this whole thing would have been annulled and she'd be home where she belongs. I can't picture her married. She's a baby! Will you please stop? I know what I'm doing. I won't force her. The responsibility of being a housewife will send her home soon enough. She'll wind up realizing just how easy it was here.

Well, come on in. Well, I think I better-- Now, he said he had to do a few things around the coffee joint, but he'll be here. Come on in. Would you like to sit down? Now, how about a drink? No, thanks. I think I'll have one myself. What time did Steve say he'd come? Don't worry, he'll show. I'll even pour him a drink. See that picture on the wall there? That's a publicity painting from "The Screaming Skull." My old man made more money on that picture than on any of them. You look real sharp tonight. If this couch could only talk, it'd be a real gas.
