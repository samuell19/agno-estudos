I'm single right now, but I've actually been texting with a guy recently and he texted me the other day that he's getting a new library card. So things are getting pretty hot and heavy. Looking forward to that. I have depression and in addition to meds and working out I also like to do self-help things and I recently started listening to an audio book version of Eckhart Tolle's "The Power of Now". Are there any Tolle heads out there? (GLASS CLANGS) Okay. And I'm enjoying it, but I'm having a bit of a hard time grasping the concepts. This wasn't helped by the fact that I was listening to it on shuffle, for three hours. I was going through a bit of a rough patch the other day, and I was talking to my mom about it and she thought maybe it was due to lack of vitamin D. So she looked at me very seriously in my eyes and said, "Honey, every day you've got to get that D." She was talking about vitamin D, but I imagined it as in D as in dick. So I've been trying. It's been kind of hard. (CARS WHOOSH) (FOOTSTEPS CLANG) (DOG BARKS) (PHONE RINGS) (DOOR SLAMS) MALE CALL INTERCEPTOR: Hello. No one is available to take your call.

I had a show it went really, really awesome. It was so cool. There was a lot of people there, which was so awesome. I even tried that new bit that I was telling you about. (SOBS) I'm sorry.

So I'm doing really good, things are okay. I work as a server and I was at work the other day, and I went up to a table to take their order and this man just put his hand right in my face. Although I didn't appreciate the gesture, it did let me know that he wasn't ready to order. It also let me know that I could go fuck myself, which I did just right afterwards. Something else that I did at work the other day when I was serving, I'm always kind of surprised at the stuff that will come out of my mouth, and I just very confidently went up to a table, I put my hands on my hips and I said, "Are you guys ready to rock?" That was my way of asking if they were ready to order. And they were, and then they ordered. Yeah, you guys have been a blast. I've had a blast. Thanks.

His name was Saul Cohen. He was from New York and he said, "Arnold, I brought you a salami wrapped in tin foil. "It's from New York. "I brought this for you, it's a salami." And my dad's sitting there and he's thinking, who is this guy? You put this in your luggage and you bring this all the way from New York? Salami wrapped in tin foil? We have salami in Winnipeg. And anyways, my grandfather he gets Saul to hook up my dad with a job. And so they're in the warehouse, it's this warehouse filled with a bunch of junk, absolute garbage, but he's a businessman. He could sell a water to a well, he's that kind of guy. And so he says, okay Yale, this is how you do business. And he picks up the phone, they're in the factory, nobody's there, he says they got a bunch of garbage. And he's talking on the phone and he says, "We got a bunch of shit here. "You better come on down. "Everything's on sale." And then he puts down the phone and nobody's there in the warehouse, and he says, "No, it's already sold, it's already sold." And then he picks up the phone, you better hurry here 'cause everything's going quick. And then he hangs up the phone and then he says, "That's how you do business Yale." And yeah, now he's a millionaire. (AIRPLANE WHOOSHES) You think that plane's going to Las Vegas? I like Vegas. I've never been.
