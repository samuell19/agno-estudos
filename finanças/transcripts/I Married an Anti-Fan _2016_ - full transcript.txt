Come on. Look at here. Good. Oh, ling ling ling We are tourists. (Korean) Hello. (Japanese) Hello. (Japanese) Hello. (Korean) Hello. You are paparazzi. No. We are journalists. Hand the photos over to me. It is my right to take... take photos. You can't stop me. Keep away from me, or else I...I will sue you for indecent assault. Right? Ridiculous! Give the photos back to me. Hey, don't fight. Hey, let me go. The camera is pricy. A man as you are, you should not rob a woman. Right. You are shameless. They have escaped. Give the photos back to me. No way. Sorry. Anyway the reports can't be published. Can't? Why? How dare you ask me why. I have compensated the man with the photos. Old trick again. Trick? I order you not go anywhere from now on. You just sit here and work as a proofreader. Don't interview others anymore. Just for the incident? Although no credit, I did make efforts. I spelled a life to do the paparazzi tasks. Let's commend on your report. What? Star Liu suspected of sterility after marrying. She got pregnant soon after the report. She was suspected of gender reassignment surgery. Can you figure out, how much money we lose when sued? 88% of your reports were false. And you even didn't write a retraction. You must be insane then. Just shut up. Do proofreading. Don't interview others. How about my position in the column section? Ah? Column section? Your performance is terrible. How dare you? Save it. Ah! Excuse me! Qi Fei, hurry up! What do you think of the awarding ceremony? Did you hear me? What do you... do you think of today's award ceremony? What do you think? Hey, I am asking you. Do you hear me? Gao Xiang, Gao Xiang. Gao Xiang, what do you think of today's awarding ceremony? Very harmonious. He is handsome. Ah! That is Hou Zhun. It is him. Zhunï¼Œare you tired of this? Don't. She is the most disgusting of journalists. Hey, I say, are your deaf? Didn't you hear me? Why don't you answer me? Is there wax in your ear? It seems as if I'm destined to proofreading for life. (Korean) Zhun. (Korean) You care about only yourself. Do you know you really are pain in the butt? I didn't see anything. I...I am blind. I say, is the grocery here? Is this a grocery? Is it? You...you. Give it to me. What do you mean? Give the cell phone to me. Sir, I am a journalist from Women Sense. Journalist, you know. Hey, what are you doing? Hey, what are you doing? Password. Do you know this is illegal? Password? I would tell you if I was enchanted. Give it back to me! Give it back to me! Give it back to me! Give it back to me! Ah! What is the matter? You should apologize. It is you who should apologize. Apologize! Calm down. Stop! You wretch! Stop there! Stop! Let me go! Get the hell out of here! Next month, we and Hou Zhun's company will develop a strategic partnership. You ought to understand what I mean. Hey, what's the matter? You look unhappy. Alas! You must be fired. Wait a minute. Thank you, madam. You are welcome. 20 yuan in total. Wow, I don't want it now. Paparazzi don't have the necessary dignity. It makes sense to quit. It was not easy for me to humbly persist. What do you think? To have a chance to be a novelist, first you have to write for the column section. Don't you need that? Anyhow the job pays. And the rent is due next week. If you two guys don't want to be supportive. Don't add insult to injury. How can I feel ok with this? Ok, let's calm down first. Hey. Maybe you could apply for reinstatement. How can I do that? Alas, you should think it over. Isn't it Hou Zhun who got you fired? Just apologize to him. Trash! Even if I was homeless and starving, I would not apologize to the wretch. Never! Mr. Hou Zhun, you had a long day. This is a cup of coffee for you. No. Who knows what's inside this weird stuff? How can there be? I intended to apologize. Begin. You can begin to apologize. Well, well, well... I am sorry that I offended you that day. Stand straight. I think... there was a misunderstanding between us. Would you please forgive me? Old Chinese saying: Better to make friends than enemies. You always say something I don't understand. I mean... if you can cease your resentment, in your heart, Maybe we can have better communication. It is helpful. Please fold your palms first. Mr. Hou Zhun, Brother Hou Zhun, I am sorry. I have troubled and offended you. I do apologize. Ok, I accept that. Really? I get it. I don't have to resign now. I will be transferred to the column section and write novels shortly. Well, that is unlikely to happen. Apology and unemployment are different. Now you know some people you should never offend. What did you say? Now you know some people you should never offend. Let me tell you about the media age. Anti-fan, that is right. I am now your anti-fan. I will spare no effort to stigmatize you. In forums, Wechat, Microblog, let me overwhelm you with my posts. Delete my posts. How dare you delete? Can't write them again? Who is the girl? What did she write? Is she insane? Excuse me! Who are you? Me? Come on, the director is looking for you. Come on, come on, quickly. The director is looking for you. Come on. The director is looking for you. Don't delay. Hurry up. What is that? Who is there? Who is this guy? Stop! Hello, everyone. As a woman, You can fight with others every now and then. That's really a rather unique state of mind. Do you really want to duke it out with him? Of course! I want to defeat him. I will have him on his knees. Bad news! Bad news! Bad, bad news! Is this your home? You came in without knocking. Watch TV, watch TV, hurry up. Have you heard of the word â€œanti-fanâ€? Korean pop star Hou Zhun and his anti-fan have become a popular topic. Efforts to hurt the pop star, by one that dislikes him, using all possible means. This behavior and those of his fans' are very different. And so also becomes a hot topic. Don't beat me. I am the broker of Hou Zhun. Please listen to me first. Please listen to me. The public has placed great attention on Mr. Hou Zhun's anti-fan. What do you want to say? The anti-fan alsoâ€¦â€¦also focuses on me. I think she ought to be tolerated. I also have many fans opposed to one anti-fan, so I don't care. What are you doing? Why don't you go out? Yes. Now you should dance in an extremely crazy manner. This way, you will calm down. Just entertain yourselves. What? It is odd. Miao Miao, I actually wanted to tell you . But being fired recently, I didn't think it was the right time. Have you fallen in love with me? I wanted to tell you that I'm moving in with Qi Fei. That is OK. It is so expensive to rent houses in Shanghai. The three of us will live together. Ah, Qi Fei, we should make an agreement first. We should bathe at different times. And your bathroom time will be limited. By the way, you are not allowed to use my bath cream. Do you understand? Ok, it is agreed! Come on, let's toast. I meant the two of us would live together. Hey! Hey! Hello. Is there Miss Miao Miao speaking? Who is that? A pop star and his anti-fan living together. Living together. Shot three times per week. During the process, act as both his broker and friend. You will gradually open up to the pop star. Get to understand each other. A new concept in reality shows. You described it with great exhilaration. I won't accept that. I will attend an advertising meeting first. Then I will go directly for a planning meeting. All has been scheduled by Manager Wang. What is the ad about? Just for crisps. It is previously endorsed by Gao. It is previously endorsed by Gao Xiang. We can live without doing the ad, can't we? Better with it. Manager Wang. Now this thing with the anti-fan, if you make use of the opportunity and exhibit tolerance for the anti-fan, you will gain a better profile. And always be in the spotlight. Wait, Ms. Fang, Ms. Fang. Please. Please do me a favor by listening to me. Does this make sense? Hou Zhun, do you know what he did to me? I have been fired and beaten by atrocious fans. I have lost my job, and my roommate. I will be homeless and out in the streets. Are you happy to learn that? It is really embarrassing to live such a life at my age. It is all Hou Zhun's fault. Actually I don't think Hou Zhun is at fault. You know nothing! Anyway, don't mention Hou Zhun in front of me. Oh the name, I get physiological reactions. I became deadly aggressive. Want to know specifics and pay? 300 thousand yuan. The program will be broadcasted for four months. The broadcasting span will be extended if it gains fair popularity. I think it will be the best choice for you until you find a new job. It is your fault to have talk about money. I, Fang Miao Miao don't care about money. Of course not. Buddy, I think we should think twice . We should discuss prudently about how to lash Hou Zhun. The organization of the program is creative, because its essence is reality. For the show, he will be in charge of the show, and I, the reality. No no no no, I will probably act differently . I don't think I will laugh and monkey about Ah, Iâ€¦â€¦who I talked about was Hou Zhun. You pretend to love and forgive him. Go ahead, haha. I am sorry I am too honest to pretend. Hopefully the audience will learn about our true personalities, even if just a little, through my stay with Hou Zhun. CUT. Perfect, very natural. You have all the qualities of a journalist. Are you in a good mood today? I feel as usual. Let's go. Please put them down gently. Careful, careful. Make sure the tripod doesn't rub the table corner. Hey, the wall, and your box. The box. You knocked the wall with the box. Be careful. Ah, why didn't you change your shoes? Are you all prepared? Hello, Mr. Director. I guess a lot of money is being spent. It was Hou Zhun who offered it to us. It is his private residence. Pop stars are wealthy as we expected. Come on, let's work efficiently. Shoot the sofa first. And then, Ms. Fang, make her up first. How about it? A small change. Is that OK? Perfect. That is a great change. I didn't expect she could be my type. What, do you want to get beaten up? Everyone get ready. Let's begin. It is rather tidy. I mean unworldly. Any human being can get it. But I don't think you can. There is an idiom in China: The more one tries to hide, more is exposed. You must have tidy up the room, in an attempt to hide the gloomy side of you. Unrestrained as I am, I can't have mysophobia. Must a normal person have mysophobia? Of course not. But you act as different people. Multiple personality. You act in different ways. Do you think you are normal? You are no better than me. Have you ever broken the law? My guess is that you have been arrested. What do you mean? You have slapped Chi Xiang twice. Both because of your temper. You ought to have been arrested. I haven't yet. But maybe in the future. Ohï¼Ÿ Maybe I will soon be arrested for murdering a renowned Korean star. It appears that I am not the one. Mental disorder caused by lack of love? Have you ever been in love with someone? Call the police. I want to kill him. I will visit you in prison. I will kill you then if everything goes well. Mind your safety, Zhun. Mind your safety. Don't touch me! Get away! I want to kill him. Don't be rude! Don't do it! Listen to me! Get away! I gonna kill him. This writes itself. Ah! What a pain! Wow, you are fragile! Miao Miao never complains about pain. No sense to compare me with her. Speaking of Miao Miao, I was thinking... In your opinion, when shall I move in? Taking Miao Miao's situation into consideration, I feel bad asking her to move. Yes. It seems that pain is merely transient happiness. Set out. What is this? Car key. You are my broker. You should drive the car. Car? What car? Are you from the past? Don't know cars? It is a requisite for brokers to drive. Can't you drive? You are kidding. When I got my driving license, you were nothing then. Don't laugh. Zhun, Zhun, open the door. (Korean) Damn it. Bad luck. I will get off. How to drive? How to start the car? How should we use it? Are you OK, Zhun? What are you doing? Aren't you going to get out? Incredible. Amazing. Let me help you. Oh, sorry, sorry. Are you OK? Don't laugh. Well, actually I feel guilty. Have you gotten hurt? Did you do that on purpose? You were trying to kill me, weren't you? I did not intend to do that. Anyway, you can't retaliate. I really had enough. You were scared. It is a snap. I'm not a little girl. Why did you react in that way? Keep away from me, OK? Well, I know I frightened you. Sorry. I said I was not sacred. Wow, wow, wow, I know. Anyway I made my apology. It's up to you to accept it or not. Except the apology, you had better not expect more. What do you think I am expecting? I would say that we are now working as commercial partners. Who do you mean? It's the scenes people expect. An awkward, inexperienced broker who makes mistakes and quarrels with me. So you act well and more professionally than me. You mean I was pretentious. You are an insidious guy. Damn. I will reckon with you. I have apologized to you. You are reaching out for a yard after taking an inch. I didn't know you are leading the ad. Is it your hobby to deprive others of their jobs? You are not the only one in the world who can do that. Is she the new partner? Much-anticipated. Miao Miao, Miao Miao, Miao Miao! What is the matter? We will be late for the script meeting. So? So, as my broker, shouldn't you urge them to put an end to the scene? Time to go. Brother, brother, don't drag me. brother, brother Hey, hey, you, come on. It is time for the script meeting. Do you want me to simply turn around and go? I can't say that. It's time to leave. Are you talking to yourself? It is time to leave! (Japanese) One more photo. Don't leave. Yes, Hou Zhun, one more photo, Please. Please, Miss. Broker. Time is up. Go home. Don't take photos. Stop. Go home immediately. I won't. Go home, quickly. All of you, stop. No sense. Go home now. That's ok. Anyway. Those fans came here from Japan. Ah, what is wrong with Zhun? So abrupt. He is rude if he simply leaves. What? That is OK. Please one by one. Hurry up! Hou Zhun, Hou Zhun, Hou Zhun, Time is up! Thanks. It's about time. Thanks. Wretch, wretch! (Korean) So pretentious. What did you say? Dare you say it in Chinese? Calm down, he said you worked hard. Really? Yes. Do you understand Korean? Certainly. I am Zhun's broker. I don't believe that. Ask him to come back. I will ask him. He has gone home to rest. Doesn't he live here? Zhun generally lives in the studio. He also has his own dormitory. This residence is normally idle. Idle? Ah, are you ok... Miao Miao, Miao Miao? Nothing, nothing. Mindâ€¦mind your hands, mind your hands! It is not painful, not, not, notâ€¦ Hello, hello, hello? I knew they knew each other/ Surprisingly, the silly-looking guy is able to compose music. Ai Lin turns up again. Wow, wow. Wow, this is life. A journalist, writer, an exhibitionist? I didn't expect you here. It is me who am supposed to say that. A journalist as you are, you surprised us by your articles. Who said you could read them? Did I allow you to enter my home? Ok, ok, I am going. Don't call the police. What is your novel about? You novel, I was unable to understand it. Nothing. I have only written a preface. Why did I answer your question just now? You could go if you don't want to. Actually, I want to write a novel about a desert inn. Gunner Mateo came in. Mateo? Does it happen in South America? China. Better to make it happen in Korea. Gunner Mateo came in and ordered a cup of whiskey. When the music suddenly stopped, they looked at the stage. Tango dancer Susan turns up. The man is named Mateo, but the girl is named Susan of China. Don't you want to listen to the story? That's it? I said I had only written a preface. I dream of being a writer. Er, dream. Why do you work as a journalist? To make a living. A hero may be embarrassed if he is penniless. As I am a girl from a small town, you will never understand the difficulties here. Because of a mindless word, I may get fired While you enjoy a powerful and luxurious life. I am leaving. Make preparations... And make sure your clothes are neat. I can live here. Only for today. It depends on my mood. Mr. Hou Zhun, help yourself to some water. The topic of today's program is: Miss. Fang shows Mr. Hou Zhun around Shanghai as a tour guide for a whole day. Tour guide? You good at torturing others. In front of us is the national flag of China. (Korean) You scared me! The building dates back more than a century ago. Look. Eat. No. Eat. No. Eat. Eat it. Eat one. No. Eat one. No. - Eat one. - No. No. No. No. No. Taste it. Hey! What are you doing? How can our international star eat smelly tofu? Rub your face with the tofu. Damn your eating. That will destroy your profile. (Korean) Sorry. Sorry, sorry. So many stage properties. Yes. They use lots of this at times. We took all of them here this time. Cute. It is disgusting for you to sleep without taking a bath. You are smelly. What are you doing? What? Why did you open eyes suddenly? Is that temporary vitality before death? Were you expecting my death? What is this? It is so childish. Hurry up and remove it. Oh, the stuff must be unlocked by a key. And? I can't remember. Hey! Are all of them sleeping? No one answers calls at midnight. What should we do? Alas, no. I was just teasing you. Ah! Driving me crazy! (Korean) I have apologized to you several times. I intended to play a small prank on you. I didn't expect it to end this way. Don't be angry. You know nothing. It is not like what you think. Then what is it like? I woke up because I needed to go to the bathroom. Close your eyes and relax. Fancy the universe in your mind. The vast and beautiful universe. In fact we are mere a tiny thing in the universe. Shut up. Hey, what are you doing? Hey, hey, hey, hey. Calm down. Hey, Hou Zhun. Calm down, hey. Ah, are you insane? Close your eyes. Yoâ€¦ Don't splash it on me. Do you hear that? Ah, you'll get me stained. Hey, wretch, your splash it on me. Ah, you'll get me stained. Let's call the police. Dial 110. You are crazy. Or we can turn to a locksmith. No. It is daybreak now. What should we do? Let's go. Thank you. This week we have some adjustments fro filming. What adjustment? Our shooting schedule conflicts with Mr. Hou Zhun's schedule in Korea. So I can take off. No, you can't. But you take a trip to Korea. So I can take off. Korea, great. Wow, it is warm. Slippers with dolls on them. Ah! Hot, hot, hotâ€¦Very hot, hot, hot. Can I go shopping in the duty-free stores? No, you have to go to Mingdong. Exo's poster is available in the flagship store. It is troublesome. You are annoying. Got it. Ai Lin. After all this time, you're still fond of taking photos secretly? Please delete them on your own. Oh! And it makes no sense for you to follow me. Most importantly, You will get nothing. Her and I are over. We will be late if it stays like this. What is the matter? It's an interview for Zhun. We should have set out earlier! Sorry, it was my fault. Why did you throw yourself into a fury? Mr. Miao Miao, that is OK, OK. Where are the deliveries? (In Korean) Yang Jea Dong first then Su Seo Dong. Anything interesting about shooting? (In Korean) Scenes of my fighting my fellow actors. Mainly because it's my first time with action scenes. It was kind of embarrassing. Have you caught up with them? No problem. You have a long day. (In Korean) Thank you for sparing some time. Your partner in the Chinese program. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. (In Korean) What do you think of Zhun? Kind of professional. He is more talented than I imagined. A promising talent. Quite amazing. What is that? When they asked about me, I was worried that you might say something bad. You meant that... Well, one should be flexible to survive. I live in your house now. Those accolades serve as rent. Offer me a bottle of wine, please. No, no, no, two bottles. Have you expected the public's reaction? Would you please answer the questions? I don't know if it was the resentment that worked. Is the audience rating good? Not a problem until the end of the second season. Is the ambience good in the Korean part? Yes, yes. Are you crying, Miao Miao? You're kidding. I am Fang Miao Miao. Yes. I am glad you are ok. Can you not be so frightening when crying? Why are you here? Hey, what are you doing? What are you doing? I won't hurt you. Thanks. How do you feel? About what? Being a popular public figure. Are you satirizing or caring for me? It depends on you. It is not so satisfactory. I agree. It is terrible to be famous. Bottoms up. Wine. She didn't answer her phone. Oh, here she comes. Alas, why didn't you pick up the phone? Thank goodness you are alive. Yes, I saw the news. You are awesome. Do you envy me? I have risen to fame. Will you do the program again? It is amazing you didn't do anything evil while staying with slick man Hou Zhun. What do you mean by slick? Mei Zi is my roommate, and Qi Fei is my colleague. I invited them to join a club. And they fell in love with each other. Fate is marvelous, isn't it? Don't you regard the roommate that betrayed you as an enemy? Not at all. You have a rigid outlook. It's unexpectedly good to see two of my best friends make a match. I didn't know that you were so kind. Ok. Silly. Ok, ladies and folks. Then let's invite the star of future, to take the stage! Miao Miao! Old trick! I haven't danced for a long time. I can't. Calm down. Just dance for fun. Miao Miao, Miao Miao. Miao Miao, Miao Miao, Miao Miao. It is my mother. Er? The prototype of the leading role is my mother. My mother was a dancer in our small town. And my father... Is he really a gunner? My father is a worker. My mother performed in my father's factory And he was soon fascinated by her dancing. From then on, he made use of all kinds of opportunities to watch my mother dance. He also waited for my mother. It seems that my father did make it big. Compared with your weird western novel, this story is more moving and real. You know nothing. A terrific story adds to the attraction of its profound moral. Just like you. You are high-profile star only when splendidly decorated. Unnecessary to be a star. You take all your good luck for granted. You have many enjoyment in life. Take myself for example. I came to Shanghai alone after college. I strived to be more outstanding. But I made little progress despite a lot of effort. It is strange that I've told you so much. Merciless as you are, you won't understand mankind's sentiments. I used to live in a village which could only be illuminated by moonlight rather than street lamps. At seventeen, I worked as a probationer in Seoul. Even the time for me to sleep was precious. Is it possible? In my eyes, you were born with a silver spoon in your mouth. Have you suffered? Did you learn to play piano at that time? You play quite well, which surprised me somewhat. I am kind of a musician. Yes. I have seen the music score, composed by Ai Lin. Alas, I wouldn't mention if not for what I've seen. But I've seen you and her several times. I saw you once in the bar. And I also saw you in Seoul. I really have seen you several times. We were all probationers, including Ai Lin and Gao Xiang. When we were about to form a team, I happened to act in a TV series in a supporting role, and drew attention from the public. Later Manager Wang canceled the plan and featured me alone. Well, how about Ai Lin? I used to love her, but Gao Xiang took her away. And Ai Lin didn't prefer me. As you do with your roommate, I give my blessing to them. I don't understand. If she didn't prefer you, why does she keep trying to meet you? Men are naturally tolerant to his first girl. No sense. You won't understand. Tango is stimulating. Ten, Fifteen. Fifteen. Come, come, come. Fifteen, Ten, Men are naturally tolerant to his first girl. What am I doing? - Brother. - Er? Was Miao Miao fired because of me? I think so. Her company is a strategic partner of our company. They are inevitably upset about your situation. Oh, are you OK? Why do you care for her? Nothing. She is pitiful. She looks poor. I've met her. Oh, yes, a brand name costume launch party next week. The booklet is there for you to read. Welcome. Why did you bring me here? Didn't you know? Mr. Zhun made the arrangement. It seems that Ms. Miao Miao is not invited to today's party. Do you get what I wanted prepared? Yes. It is in the car. It is a new best seller this year. Ms. Miao Miao is coming. She looks quite different. It is for you. For me? Really? You're going to be accompanying me in a bit. I don't want to lose face because of you. I know. Mr. Hou Zhun, would you please introduce the pretty lady to us? Don't you recognize her? She is my anti-fan. Journalist Miao Miao. Hello, everyone. It was embarrassing. I was stunned. I couldn't laugh. What was wrong with you? The courage of beating Brother Chi Xiang? Am I Miss Thirteen of Hongxing? I don't beat everyone. Nice to see you again. You have not dated a girl for a long time. Isn't this Ms. Anti-fan? Stay with Hou Zhun for a while. She has gotten impolite. But clothes will boosted anyone's appearance Ms. Fang is pretty today. Yes. Especially the necklace. Let me go. Why do you want to go all of a sudden? I know I am an appendage of pop star industrial chain. It's ok if you make use of me. But to make use of my emotions? Have you signed an agreement with me or given me money? You should do that with appropriate manners. What are you talking about? Don't be angry. You deal with love just like children. Can't you deal with it on your own rather than involve me in it? Please let me explain. You misunderstand me. Let me go. Are you quarreling? You pop stars are all simple-minded. Miss Fang is funny. She is of poor taste. It is surprising you should court her. Shut up. Courting Ai Lin and Miss Fang shows that your taste is poor too. This is the end of my tending you. What on earth? Sorry, Manager Wang. It is my fault. I am fully responsible for that. Cease all filming. Oh, but some is already scheduled. Try to put it off. I understand. I will do that right now. Yes. Magazine office. Chief Editor. Welcome back. What should I call you? Miao Miao, the new director of the column section. Anyway, congratulations for your glorious return and promotion. Oh, yes, Hou Zhun's broker company temporarily ceased his cooperation. Actually we have appointed you as the new director based on our new partner's suggestion. I would like to tell you that he is actually a very handsome guy. Here, this is him. Didn't you declare to disclose the gloomy side of Hou Zhun's personality? As the new partner of your magazine office, I will fully support you. And with your engagement in the reality show, your reports will be more convincing. Isn't it a godsend? Hey. Now? Ok. Sorry, I have to take care of some businesses. Does she think she really is famous? She is so complacent. I've forgotten about last night. You know, I tend to forget all the enmity overnight. It was me who bought the necklace. Zhun asked me to buy a necklace. Broker Chi Xiang. I didn't expect I should meet Ai Lin there. Ai Lin. I think she wore the same on purpose. Oh. In fact I talked with Zhun before I bought the necklace. I asked him if he got along well with Miao. Yes. Really? She said she strived to make a living. He knew you had been fired because of him. Actually Zhun felt guilty. But he was not the decision-maker anyway. When playing piano in the club that day, he was really handsome. Just like your father. A gentle man who plays piano. Isn't he your Mr. Right? My folks, I and you, Mei Zi We belong to the same class. But he belongs to another. It is awesome of you to recover it such a short time. Hey! Hey, Miao Miao, did you write this article? What is the matter? Hurry up to see it online, be quick! Even if it's just a little, hopefully the audience will know the truth of your so-called model. Journalist Miao, is that Journalist Miao? Journalist Miao Miao, Journalist Miao Miao. When you agreed to be in the program, was it to write this article? What is the motivation behind it? Is the article true? From the beginning, Couldn't you figure out this crazy woman's motive? Zhun, go back to Korea and stay there. Why? Did I make a mistake? What do you think? The report is true. What are you worried about, me or the profile of the company? Are you powerful enough to be so complacent? Get out! Quickly! Oh, it is Miao Miao. You finally write a stimulating article. Sit. I will treat you to supper to celebrate. You read the stuff in my computer. And you restored what I had deleted. You were stealing. You go too far to describe that as stealing. You wanted to publish it when you first wrote it. Didn't you? You hoped others would discuss it, and view you as a victim. You are damned despicable. Pretend to be a victim? I am a real victim. It was true that Zhun betrayed me and Ai Lin to make his debut. Why are you hostile towards me? We ought to be partners, oughtn't we? Do you know why I was fired by the company? Er? Miao Miao. You are despicable. A despicable villain. Calm down. I have to say, retract the article right now. If you don't, I will burn the damned magazine office. Calm down. Let me go. Zhun, Zhun. Start the car. What do you mean? Are you leaving? Don't do that. You still have us, even if you are unemployed. Alas, what she needs now is not us at all. She doesn't need us. Does she need justice ? It is Hou Zhun. Justice has been destroyed. I don't have to make calmly any more. You can explain to him. Can you stand the insult on your character? You are still sleeping. Are you surprised to find me here? Don't you know about Zhun and me? Is it natural to be surprised? Sorry, I have to go. I intended to make a formal apology to you. I am sorry. Get up. You have to eat. You caught a headache this morning? What do you prefer for breakfast? Something light may be better. Why are you here? Is it not more appropiate for me to be here than her? Get out. Zhun! Get out! As a journalist, it is largely my fault. I get used to writing articles based on my own mood. My reports were based on imagination instead of facts. I tended to write articles in an exaggerated way. As a journalist, I admit that I was a failure. And for my partnership with Zhun in the reality show, I indeed had ill intentions at the beginning. But he was not like the person I had imagined. He seemed to live a more strenuous life than most other people. I am not entitled to libel him with a journalist's pen, which can manipulate the public's opinion. Whether as recovery of conscience, or as payment to Hou Zhun's care during the filming, I thus delayed publishing this faulty articles. Speaking of the negative influence of the disclosure on Mr. Hou Zhun, I have to make an impartial statement. I confirm that I have fabricated the news of the love triangle. This fabrication was my way to hurt Hou Zhun. An incompetent journalist of his anti-fan. I hereby express my regret and apology. I am willing to take all legal responsibilities of the negative impact of the article. I've also decided to quit my job. That is all what I can do. My sincerest apologies. Thank you. This is a piece of entertainment news. The scandal of the love triangle involved, Hou Zhun and Gao Xiang 's troubles, have been proved to be a false report, from Journalist Miao Miao, an anti-fan of Hou Zhun. And according to Women Sense, the incident had been Miao's personal action and had nothing to do with them. She is indeed out. Ok. Wish you a pleasant journey! Thanks. First class. Oh, has someone made a mistake? This is first-class cabin. Yes, your seat has been upgraded. Is it a sales promotion of the airline? I purchased a economic-class cabin ticket. Ah, I am sorry. Now we can't find the reason. Ah. Sorry. It doesn't matter. Why are you... you here? Don't speak to me in this way. You have spoiled my scene of departure. But I am too kind to scold you. I really intend not to see you anymore. It is intention rather than will. Were you following me? I also go to Harbin to scout locations for filming. I'm going invest and make a film. It is about a village dancer and a factory worker's love story. Without any flashy elements, the film will be simple and pure. Would you please write the script for me? No! Er. I have something to tell you. Brother Chi Xiang bought the necklace. No. That day I and Ai Lin... No. So we make a deal for the script. You are not my boss, let me see the agreement first. Do you want to earn money from me? Even reckoning makes long friends. Understand? Hou Zhun, Hou Zhun, Hou Zhun Hello. We only tailor make one ring per customer. Means his is a true lifetime love.
