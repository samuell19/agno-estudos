In an age of kings and princes, power was in the hands of a few, and then a man came who challenged an empire with little more than an idea. His story would involve millions, and it would inspire generations in the search for the truth. His name, Martin Luther. Every word Luther says in this movie is textual of his writings and talks. I can not and do not want to retract. A fearless monk named Martin Luther he had just infuriated the most powerful leader in Europe, Emperor Carlos V. And Charles wanted Luther dead. Luther did not have an army to protect him. However, it had a different kind of protection, popular support. Thanks to the recent invention of the written press, Luther's protest against the church, It had made him the first European celebrity. It was the first theologian he had to the media with him. The burning of Luther's writings would not stop the inevitable confrontation between the old and the new. The medieval versus the modern. His bad reputation made him someone you couldn't dismiss, nor from whom you could get rid. Get rid of Martin Luther it would be the concern of the most powerful people in the world for decades. The way was prepared for one of the millennium battles, that of a bustling monk with media knowledge against the emperor, the Pope, and even Henry VIII. Daily life in 15th century Europe was not easy. Half of the children would not become adults. Diseases were increasing and food was often scarce. There were no guarantees for the poor and desperate, beyond the occasional gifts of those more fortunate. Life was a little better in the city of Mansfeld, thanks to the thriving copper industry, where a manager named Hans Luther was rising in rank. Hans realized that he would need a solution. to the constant legal debates that decreased their operations. In early 1490, He found the answer in his son, Martin. I was preparing him for a college education, with an eye to a career as a lawyer. There were frequent conflicts between miners and smelters. DOCTOR - PROFESSOR SEMINAR CONCORDIA And Luther's father believed َ that it would be useful to have a lawyer in the family to help solve some of those problems. At his early twenties, Martin Luther had met his father's expectations, and earned a bachelor's and master's degree in record time. But when he started studying law, something was wrong. Father. Luther left the studies suddenly, halfway through the year, and returned home to see his father. Hans' wishes for a lawyer in the family would vanish. ?Who do you want to be? Martin wanted to please his father, but his law courses seemed banal to him. - Please... - What is it? Answer my question. Especially in light of serious concerns and Martin's fears that they were about to reach a breaking point. Get out. Father... Like most of the people of that time, Luther saw acts of nature as acts of God. For Luther, the intensity of this storm brought back his conscience. Luther made a promise that night. If his life was spared, he would become a monk. The man must first shout that he sees no hope. In this riot, Salvation will begin. When man thinks he is lost, the light appears. In a few days, Luther arrived at an Augustinian monastery, leaving behind the right and all the expectations of his father. Hans thought his son was wasting his life. Furthermore, an oath of celibacy meant having no grandchildren. DOCTOR - PROFESSOR PAC ح FICO LUTHERAN SEMINAR His father was not happy with his decision entering the monastery and let him know. The decision to become a monk should not have been an impulse. Martin Luther's heart was already sad and fearful of an almighty God with impossibly high standards. DOCTOR - WESTMINSTER TEOL س GICO TEACHER SEMINAR For Luther, his feelings of guilt were accompanied by feelings of fear. DOCTOR - AUTHOR "MART ح N LUTERO AND THE LASTING WORD OF GOD" I was afraid of a vengeful God. Luther hoped that he would punish himself for his sins satisfy God. It was hitting, I fasted for days, I slept outside, in the cold. But those extreme measures did not seem to work. Luther still felt guilt for his sins. I myself, more than once, I fell into the abyss of despair, to the point where I never wished I had been created. ؟ Love God? ,I hated it! DOCTOR - CARDINAL ARCHBISHOP OF NEW YORK He was a motivated monk, who couldn't sleep because I thought: "؟ I'm doing everything what the church expects of me? ؟ Am I obeying the rules of my religious order, Augustine? Did I say the correct sentence? I better do it right or I'll go to hell. " Luther's supervisor and friend, Johann von Staupitz, understood that the rite of confession of the church it was designed to bring relief to those burdened with guilt. Forgiveness for each type of sin. Luther confessed but did not find much relief. While some monks confessed in just a few minutes, Luther could be hours and hours. I was afraid that just one unspoken sin could be his downfall. He went to confession, he repented, he atoned for himself, but I still thought: "I still don't feel saved, I do not feel happy, I'm not at peace I'm still in agony. I can't win and receive God's love, his compassion and his salvation. " That was his concern. Despite his internal struggles, Luther was a good student and earned the respect of his peers. He was incredibly hard-working. DOCTOR - AUTHOR "MART ح N LUTERO: ONE LIFE" Because of that and his innate intellect, and because of his passion, He advanced very fast in the monastery community. After two years of preparation, Luther was ordered, and celebrated his first mass in 1507. For Martin, that was a moment of complete panic, since he felt the full weight of his lack of merit before God. Once again, Luther's conscience condemned him. As a priest, Luther believed that he had reached his highest calling. Luther's father was not so sure. He wondered if Luther's call to the monastery came from God. or the devil. Luther's anguish grew. Staupitz was sure that the way to alleviate it was to keep him busy. He had already persuaded Luther to do a doctorate in theology. Now, a new challenge. Staupitz landed a job for Luther at the faculty of the new university in Wittenberg. Luther's mission continued. "He was guiding me through calm waters. He restores my soul. " AND... You, back there. ?What does this mean? ?Not? ?Someone? ?Not? The city of Wittenberg was something of a branch. And the university was not known. But that started to change in 1517, when a traveling friar named Johann Tetzel he created his controversial fundraiser nearby. Tetzel told the citizens that the documents he sold, called "indulgences", they could erase the consequences of their sins. The attraction was irresistible. Many were misled by Tetzel's statements. A practice that seemed... DOCTOR - AUTHOR "CHANGING THE CHURCHES" ... many times like... Something like the sale of salvation. ?What is this? ، It's extortion! A conspiracy opposed to religion. He only wants to make money from men without principles. Corruption was not just a local problem. The tentacles stretched all the way to Rome. ROMA SACRO EMPIRE ROMANO One of the external reasons and one of the contributing factors to the success of the Protestant Reformation, Everybody knows, was the corruption of that time in the Catholic church, which cannot be denied. St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, in 1517, it had not yet been built. There were plans, but the work had been stopped because Pope Leo X I didn't have enough funds. I was committed to trying... DOCTOR - AUTHOR "EARLY MODERN EUROPE" ... update the buildings in the city of Rome, to transform it into a nice place to live, for which he needed money. Funds were raised with the sale of indulgences. And no one sold them more aggressively than Johann Tetzel. No one could compete with such a blatant seller. He told the peasants that their dead relatives they screamed in pain in purgatory, who asked for relief, which could grant a simple coin. Tetzel promoted himself from start to finish. I mean, this guy was... It was a fake wherever you saw it. From Luther's perspective, selling indulgences alienated people from God. Soon, all the churches, the palaces, the walls and bridges of Rome will be built with our money. ؟ Why does the pope not build San Pedro with his own money? He is richer than Crassus. It would be better if he sold the basilica and give the money to the poor, who are being plucked by these indulgence sellers. To take care of the problem, organized an academic debate on the subject. He began to write 95 topics for debate or thesis. Then, at the most iconic moment of the time, Luther nailed his 95 theses to the door of the church in Witternberg. Those who believe that through these letters of indulgence they make sure they are saved, they will be eternally doomed, along with their teachers. The result was indifference. No one wanted to debate with Luther. All the reform could have stopped there If not for a new invention that had recently arrived in Wittenberg. A revolutionary technology called the written press. Before the written press, the process of making books was excruciating. Every word had to be meticulously handwritten. It could take years to create a single copy of a book. In the middle of the XV century, Johannes Gutenberg perfected a type of mobile written press. One that could generate in seconds what formally took months. But the printers still had a problem, the content. They needed material to go viral, to create controversy, and increase sales. Nothing accomplished the task until they found the 95 theses of Martin Luther. It was perfect. Without Luther knowing, the printers began to issue thousands of copies. It was a match that was lit in 1517, a campfire, whose flames are still burning. They spread like wildfire. In ten days he was already in Spain. It is incredible. DOCTOR - AUTHOR "ENCOUNTERS WITH LUTHER" He was very surprised that everything he said suddenly he was exposed. Although the 95 theses were written for academics, and not for peasants, there was something that was clear to everyone. The document denounced the sale of indulgences. Luther had touched a sensitive point, and aroused the perception that the Pope had too much power and that he wanted too much money from the Germans. - This is mine. - ?Seriously? Where did you get it? It is everywhere. At first Luther did not know that his ideas were spreading. They were printed. Yes. He soon realized that he was like a celebrity. The accidental author of a best seller. A job that boldly announced corruption to everyone. Avoid those who seek your soul in a purse. In his sermons and his writings, Luther continued to criticize what he saw as repairable errors of the church. Suppose they say: "I will never buy an indulgence again." I would say: "Good". My will, my desire, my supplication and my advice is that no one buys an indulgence. Let lazy Christians buy indulgences. You stay away from them. Some want to call me a heretic. I don't care much about that gossip. Especially when those who do this they have dark minds and they have never even smelled a bible. Soon, the heretic label became permanent. Church leaders tried to contain Luther. Luther would be interrogated in the city of Augsburg. Now I must die. I will be a disgrace to my parents. Luther's interrogator was Cardinal Cayetano, one of the most experienced theologians of that time. For Luther, Cayetano had the authority and power of the pope himself. And once described him as some kind of bad cop trying to break it. MAG ح STER IN DIVINITY - PROFESSOR COLEGIO MART ح N LUTERO I wanted them to bring the questioned, for the interrogator to enter and try to break Luther, if possible. But when Cayetano asked Luther to retract his statements on indulgences, Martin did not. Luther based his position on an even more egregious statement. His Holiness abuses the Bible. I deny that he is above Holy Scripture. Cayetano was outraged by Luther's lack of papal authority, and for their lack of respect. Cayetano does not think clearly as a Christian. You are so qualified to deal with this situation like a donkey to play the harp. And certainly some of Luther's friends they were concerned about their disrespect towards such important characters. Luther's friends believed that his scandalous statements they put him in grave danger. They persuaded them to escape from the city. Sneaking through the guards, and fleeing to the known security of Wittenberg. A more careful man would have kept a low profile, but Luther did the opposite when he agreed to hold a very public debate in the city of Leipzig. Luther's opponent, Johann Eck, earned points as the controversialist, but his performance did not captivate the audience. People don't understand me. So let me be clear in my own language. I only say that a simple layman armed with Holy Scripture, one can believe more than the pope or that a tip without it. As for the pope's decree on indulgences, I say that neither the church nor the pope they can establish articles of faith. Those must come out of Holy Scripture. God once spoke through a donkey. I will tell you what I think bluntly. I am a Christian theologian. Want to believe freely and not be a slave to anyone's authority, either from a council, from a university or from the pope. One thing was clear. Luther had rejected the pope and the church as the highest sources of authority. Instead, it depended entirely on the Bible. LE س N X Pope Leo was not happy with Luther's statements, but he measured his response. As part of the arrangement, Luther agreed to remain silent. I tried it. But when the opposition ridiculed his ideas, Luther began to write again in 1520 and produced some of the most significant work of his career. Sales successes that made Europe speak. The first, to the Christian nobility of the German nation, He unveiled Luther's ideas on the reform of the church. For a long time, the church considered that priests, monks, and nuns they had a higher calling than that of the rest of the Christians. For Luther, that was wrong. He watched the Bible level the playing field. DOCTOR IN THEOLOGY ح A - EDITOR "LUTERO COMENTADO" So, a maid who cleaned a room not just cleaning a room, I was doing God's work. DOCTOR - TEACHER OF THE LIGHT SCHOOL OF THEOLOGY OF CHICAGO I think Luther gave value to vocations, who believed that all the things that people do they have value. AUTHOR "MART ح N LUTERO AND THE LIFE OF VOCATION س N" And so Luther's view on the subject was radical. Revolution َ to society. Suddenly, the commoners demanded more of their princes, and many monasteries emptied, since its purposes were no longer clear. It was the kind of message that the public wanted to hear. And Luther, the writer, knew just how to get his attention. The printers sold all the copies of the treaties that they could print. Luther's fame grew. Luther fed the controversy with particularly intense language. He was almost incapable of being moderate. He saw himself engaged in an epic battle for souls. A battle that required strong words, not civilized chatter. You are murderers, traitors, liars, the worst trash of the worst people on the planet. They are full of the worst demons in hell. ، So full, they can't do more than throw up and cast out demons! It was very common from all sides of the reform debates make personal attacks on your opponents and say absolutely horrible things about them and their mothers and all their relatives. He is a pig, a donkey, a dung heap, the spawn of a viper, a lying jester, an idiot with a foamy mouth and a prostitute's face. DOCTOR - AUTHOR "THE SCANDALOUS DOG" I had fits of anger that they made him sometimes express himself in somewhat crude language. I ask you to blow your nose, to lighten your head and clear your brain. I was still talking like a farmer or a miner, so their language was colorful, excessive and fun. We are allowed to laugh, have fun and hug our wives, whether they are naked or clothed. Yeah, it was fun reading Luther in part because it was expressed in a way, how to say it? very earthy. Sometimes in a way that we call eschatological. I mean, sometimes it was raw. At this point, Luther's understanding of the relationship between God and people he was beginning to be their focus. The central question that Luther was trying to answer it is one that almost everyone does. "؟ What makes me a good person, a person of good in the eyes of God? " What is normal for religious rhetoric that is, "Well, God does this, but you must do this." Luther was punished for a long time for not feeling worthy, he was tormented by the guilt of his failures, and even his devotion as a monk could not help him. ، The honest person lives only on faith! ، The honest person lives only on faith! Your Highness, please sit down. Please sit down. Luther's advances were triggered by a passage from Epistola to the Romans, that made him believe that God's favor could not be earned, not even partially, doing good deeds. Instead, he saw justice as an award that God gave to those who had faith in Jesus. For him, this was good news, and it was not the news they had been receiving. Now he has what he considers good news for his people, instead of bothering them with more and more things to do and more and more standards they have to meet. Christ's suffering, death, and resurrection accomplished it all. Your good works will not save you, in the least. Not. Grace is a gift that God gives you. Luther's ideas faced obvious follow-up. If God sets people free from the need to do good deeds to earn heaven, So what should a Christian do with that freedom? Again Luther saw the answer clearly. This is the true Christian life. When a man is dedicated with happiness and love to serve others voluntarily and for nothing, doing only something that helps, beneficial, and honest for our neighbor. Since by faith we are already linked to all the good things of Christ. So, when you didn't have to worry about your future, you were free to worry about the future of others. If you met all the time, as Luther said, focused on yourself, and life revolves around you and what you... All of that. What a miserable life when you don't have eyes to see others, others whom you could love. So now you can live as you really are, a loving person, you can love your neighbor. That's what reform was about. Completely, since everything is anchored to that. In all the good things in Christ... Leon tried to control Luther by issuing a papal bull a formal document that required Luther you will deny his writings. Peace. The time for silence is over. It is time to speak. The delivery of the papal bull unleashed unease among Luther's followers. Luther took his riskiest step thus far, burn the bull. If they excommunicated me for the sacrilege of heresy, I will excommunicate them in the name of God's sacred truth. Christ will judge which excommunication will be upheld. Amen. You could no longer go back. MAXIMILIANO CARLOS When Emperor Maximilian died in 1519, her grandson, Carlos, was chosen to replace him. I was only 19 years old. He was raised to be a king, But I was still 19 years old. The needs of the Germans were not important to Carlos, But he did want to keep his empire together. And he believed that the key to cohesion was a unified religion. A policy that made Martin Luther an unnecessary nuisance on his side. But Carlos had to be careful. Luther's public support was enormous. So, in an attempt to appear disinterested, Carlos agreed to have a formal hearing in German territory, in the city of Worms in 1521. Since people knew that Luther was going to be there, he was already a media star, many people participated in the event. There was anticipation for this confrontation between the mighty emperor and the humble but popular monk. AUTHOR "THE PROTEST OF LUTHER" And when I finally got to the gates of Worms, the crowd went wild. Tell your masters that if there were so many demons in Worms like tiles on the roofs, I would enter. ، I'll have a debate! I must do it. As he approached the audience, he began to understand the seriousness of the situation. Many assumed that Luther would be burned at the stake before the day ended. Burning someone at the stake was violence, terrorism, exercised by the state to maintain social control. And it is very powerful, very disturbing. In the middle of the room there was a collection of books written by Luther. He was asked to deny all his writings, to publicly retract his statements, and thus he would be saved. This could be your end. So, I was very nervous about what could happen. Since they want a simple answer, I will give them to you without horns or teeth. I do not accept the authority of the popes or the councils, since they contradict each other. Unless I am convinced by Holy Scripture or some clear reason, my conscience is captive to the word of God. I do not want and I can not retract anything since it is not safe or correct to go against one's conscience. God help me. He had the opportunity to save his life. But then he had the opportunity to test his commitment, and: "Is this what I really believe in?" I was willing to die for it. And he never changed his mind. The media went wild. It was April, late at night, it was dark there were torches that gave the only illumination, and suddenly ، paf! Since he was kind of the drama master, sneaked out of the place and disappeared for a while. Charles signed a decree condemning Luther, ordering him to receive a punishment for his high treason. Carlos realized that he would not be wise arrest Luther in the midst of his followers, so he honored his prior agreement to grant Luther safe conduct. Some precious days of leave before the sentence was executed. Luther took the opportunity to return home, but it never came. Martin Luther was dead. That is what the Germans assumed when they heard about their kidnapping. But Luther's story was not yet over. In fact, he was about to enter a new chapter. Luther's hiding place was a secret room in Wartburg Castle. He let his beard grow to camouflage himself. His code name was "Caballero Jorge". Martin Luther did not like the solitude of the castle, but that did not diminish his work. Here, he embarked on one of the most significant projects of his life. Translate the New Testament into the language of the people. Luther finished his translation in just 11 weeks. I used َ words that people in the fields could understand and relate to. José speaks to Mar ي a in the most beautiful German you can imagine. Luther's exile at Wartburg Castle lasted for َ months. He began to hear stories of how the movement it had begun to stray... Seriously. In Wittenberg, the anti-Catholic crowd broke windows in churches and destroyed works of art. The supposed prophets proclaimed that they could replace the Bible. MAG ح STER IN DIVINITY - SPEAKER MINISTRIES TIME OF GRACE It hurt Luther to see that those people he loved and trusted, they would forget his influence while he was gone. As if the reactor control lines had been removed. To calm the agitation, in March 1522, Luther ended his exile and returned to Wittenberg. We must give each other what God gave us through faith. I predicted respect, patience and non-violence. The order came back for a while. When he returned to Wittenberg, he was completely alone. I think if I couldn't have made a good impression on him to people at that time, it would all be over. So it was an extraordinary moment. In early 1523, Martin Luther received a secret letter of nine nuns who hoped to escape the convent. In most of the German territory, that would be simple, but these nuns lived on unconditionally Catholic land of Duke George. Whoever helped them escape would face the death penalty. Luther devised a covert operation. A local vendor would take your usual pickle order to the cloister of the nuns. But when he left, the empty cart would not be empty at all. The plan worked perfectly. But then Luther had a new problem. ؟ What to do with a cart full of women that they had no way to support themselves? In time, I would find them suitable homes, or husbands to all but one, Catalina de Bora. She did not like the arrangements that Luther proposed, and came to reject various marriage proposals. But she was ready to marry Luther. At that time, Luther was 41 years old and his friends pressured him to find a wife. Luther's friends said, "What do you think of her?" And he replied َ: "Okay". And they convinced him that she would be a good person to be his wife. Finally, Martín agreed to marry Catalina, Although it wasn't because I had romantic feelings, at least not at first. Luther explained that the reason why he married it was to please his father and to annoy the pope. In time, Marti came to love her very much. She was smart, resourceful, and skilled with finances in ways that Luther was not. We remember her as Catalina de Bora and not like Mrs. Martin Luther for a reason. She was left alone, she didn't belong to anyone. To marry someone as tough and bold as Luther was, she must have been with him. Catalina ran orchards, brewed beer, slaughtered pigs, and gave birth to six children. At one point, the home of the Luther, a former monastery, It accommodated more than a dozen guests. Catalina handled it skillfully. He would approach her and say: "By the way, honey, forty more people will come to dinner. Find something for them to eat. " In a time when it was illegal for a man to inherit his wife, Luther did it anyway. So great was his respect for Catherine. He was not a feminist, but his vision of humanity it was as exclusive as you could expect from a 16th century man. In 1527, Luther fell ill. The disease was not something strange. In the past, I had had kidney stones, gout, insomnia, dizziness and ringing in the ears. But that year the most challenging of all hit him. A reappearance of his deep bouts of depression. At times, he would lock himself in his room for days. There was a specific word that I used to say. It is amphechtung. MAG ح STER IN DIVINITY TEACHER - LCMS That is an attack. Some people translate it as anxiety or something similar. It is a spiritual attack. In this, his most severe attack, Luther felt totally abandoned, full of doubt, only in the universe, as if God had died. In the late summer of 1527, it seemed that God had died. Doctors covered in grotesque masks arrived in Wittenberg to try to stop an outbreak of the plague. The need for others was enough to get Luther out of his discomfort and serve as minister to the sick and comfort the dying. Many evacuated the city, but Martín and Catalina stayed despite the fact that Catalina was several months pregnant. Her daughter Elizabeth would die a few months after her birth. Suffering, which was something that was feared, and that it was to be avoided in Christian spirituality, had become an opportunity for Luther to love your neighbor. Luther's counsel in difficult times, was for those difficult moments to be reinterpreted like opportunities for beauty, opportunities for love. In those extreme times of death and abandonment, Luther wrote his most powerful hymn. "Strong Castle". Strong castle is our God Defense and good shield The title might suggest a hymn about the battle, but for Luther it was about comfort and hope in times of trial. Martin Luther did not age well. Already in his 50s, his body seemed decades older, since the diseases had wreaked havoc. Luther faced the most devastating emotional blow of his entire life when her 13-year-old daughter, Magdalena, fell ill. When you love your child and something breaks... It's like you can see how broken his heart was. Raising children taught Luther about patience, love, and now about pain. Magdalena died with her father by her side. I ask God that I and all of us let's not have such a death, neither... such a life. His brilliant presence. His eyes full of confidence, coming from our love. And that event, if you read the letters that came later, when he comforted people who had lost a loved one or a son or his wife, he said over and over: "I know what you're going through, I still think of Magdalena, I still think about it and I still miss it. " Magdalene's death triggered a dark period in Martin Luther. In a few weeks, he would write his most infamous and disturbing work. A surprise attack on the Jews. He read the Bible through the eyes of Christ and he was never able to commit to any other kind of reading, which is a problem if you are talking to a jew. The document promulgated burning synagogues and expels the Jewish people. Modern Lutherans and their churches have officially disowned Luther's anti-Semitic writings, but books are still a black stain on his legacy. We must also take into account that Luther's willingness to get involved in that matter it came from a context of a society that was not tolerant. There was no modern notion of tolerance. Twenty years before, Luther had written about the Jews in positive terms. In 1523, he wrote a piece titled, Jesus Christ Was Born Jewish, in which he argued that it is duty of Christians to be kind to the Jews who lived in their cities, in order to make Christ want them so I can take them to church. He assumed that when his new view on the Bible were explained to the Jewish people, they would be converted. DOCTOR - AUTHOR "HISTORY, LAWS AND CHRISTIANITY" Of course that was terribly innocent. They were the product of centuries of medieval persecution and all that. And they would not convert to Christianity. And that was something that Luther could not understand. Towards the end of his life, he became more and more angry and thought: "Come on, Jews. They had 1500 years to think about it, the time is up. " Probably because he believed his time was up. At that time, Luther's texts did not lead to violence against Jews. But 400 years later, Adolf Hitler's regime would unearth Luther's sayings and he would use them to justify his campaign against the Jewish people. The Nazis took phrases from Luther to reinforce their opinions. You could use Luther phrases to reinforce anything. He said all kinds of things. HITLER THREATENS WITH RETALIATION AGAINST THE JUD ح OS Ironically, in the same decade when Hitler was beginning to use Luther to justify his oppression, An American visiting Germany used Luther to the contrary. BAPTIST WORLD CONGRESS 1934 - BERL ح N, GERMANY The American was so captivated with the story of Martin Luther's fight against oppression, who changed his name from Michael King to Martin Luther King Sr. MAG ح STER IN DIVINITY DIRECTOR OF THE AFRICAN AMERICAN CLERGY When he arrived from Germany, he said to his son: "We will change our names to Martin Luther and we will be Martin Luther King, and Martin Luther King Sr. and Martin Luther King Jr. " And that resonated a lot in the black community. He saw something there, regarding Martin Luther, who caught him and said, "This is who we are." LUTHER'S LEGACY LASTS ON NON-VIOLENT PROTESTS The fact that Luther could deploy a massive change no need to use weapons it continues to give hope to the oppressed around the world. HOPE WE WILL OVERCOME IT I think Luther became a model of how to defend himself, based on faith, against institutions and individuals that hurt other people. On February 18, 1546, Martin Luther affirmed his beliefs one last time Before die. In the mid and late 16th century the many strands of reform would join together to create a rope strong enough to establish Protestant churches across most of Europe, after the Americas and the world. PROTESTANTS No Protestant school subscribes to all that Luther said and wrote. But his ideas have left an indelible mark in the lives of nearly a billion Protestants. METHODIST - LUTHERAN - BAPTIST - EPISCOPAL - PENTECOSTAL - PRESBYTERIAN And so we will vindicate Luther and we will affirm what Luther has to say and teach, At the same time we will disagree with Luther. I would say that Luther is important because, agree with him or not, he asked some of the most basic questions about human existence. Luther's lasting influence extends beyond the church. He unleashed new ways of thinking that continue to deeply shape the secular world. ...Christian life. For example, as an advocate for children's education, Luther helped create the path of the current public school system. He saw me teach people to read and write it was good for society. Faith and love. Luther included the need to educate women at a time when no prominent figure believed that. In the context of the sixteenth century, enact women to receive basic education he was revolutionary. Like an impoverished stranger who faced kings and popes, Luther continues to inspire belief that individuals can make a change without violence. From the Civil Rights movement to countless protests, Martin Luther still nurtures an ideology of hope. He spoke bravely. He said the words that had to be said. And I think that is what resonates the most in the Third World. It is freedom and the ability to say a word it could not have been said otherwise. Ideas do matter. And perhaps ideas are more powerful than armies. Luther probably would not have supported the American revolution. CONGRESS, JULY 4, 1776. A STATEMENT BY THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES OF NORTH AMERICA IN A GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE CONGRESS. But, without realizing it, he started a cultural movement that led to democracy in the United States and in Europe. I let the genie out of the bottle, so to speak, on issues that, ultimately, will bear fruit on democracy. We can't even see, I think, the democratic revolution 18th century without taking into account the contribution that Martin Luther had. Luther created the way for western democracy otherwise important. He was the first to demonstrate the power of the media, in amplifying the market for ideas, in serving as a government review. Despite its impact, Martin Luther did not want to get involved in politics or secular life. Luther always focused on finding the right relationship between God and the people. And how to show love to other people in need. I simply spoke, prayed, and wrote the words of God. If I didn't do that, I didn't do anything. And while I drank beer with my friends, the words so weakened the papacy that no prince or emperor it could inflict losses on them. But I... I did not do anything. The word did it all. He speaks to the universal hunger we have to find our reason for being and find an orientation that helps us explain why we are here and what we do here. And all of that has an impact on how we live in this world. Very few have played such an important role in shaping the world.
