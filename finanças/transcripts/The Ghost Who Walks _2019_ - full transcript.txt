No. Let me out the back. Lock the door, Ameen. - Go, go, go, go. - What is wrong, my friend? I need you to let me out the back. - Lock the door behind me and buy me some time. - Okay, follow me. These guys are no joke, Fazil. Don't get in their way. Just buy me some time. Just like the old days, my friend. Yeah. What can I do for you, my friend? The guy that came in here. Where the fuck did he go? I don't know what you're talking about, my friend. No man came in here. No man came in here! Only you. There is only you. Nobody came. Open it! Son of a bitch is gonna make this hard. Let's get out of here. Pops, it's me! I ain't blind yet. - Get the fuck out of here! - I ain't got nowhere else to go. Goddammit. Pops, come here. You is a stupid fucking kid coming back here. Do you know that? I ain't got much of a choice. Course you do. Fucking rat. You ain't got no friends left? Where's Lena, Pops? Ask your boss. Donnie? Nah, fucking Mother Mary. You messing with me, Pops? So Lena's with Donnie? Fucking-- the man's got respect for you. Didn't want you knowing. More respect than you deserve, I'd say. Fucking rat. Don't call me that. Fucking rat! I raised you better than that. Not like you give a damn about what happens to me right now. I'm trying to get my family back. You're gonna help or not? Family? What family? Your girl fucking the man that wants you dead and your child probably don't even know you exist. Shit. You ain't got no family. I got a little girl out there who deserves to know who her real father is. I think that should count for something. You ain't no father. That makes two of us. Nolan. She gave me this. Wanted me to get it to you. Donnie's got her set up in some fucking jewelry store or something over on Jefferson somewhere. They run cash through there. That's where you'll find her. If I was you, kid, I'd run like hell. Run 'til you forget your own name and nobody can find you no more. That's what I'd do. You're a coward, Pops. That was always your problem. Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas! Spare a dime for the Tots of America Incorporated. Miss, Miss? You look like a very nice girl. Spare a dime? Come on, I'm an old man. You sir, you look like a nice fellow. If you could just spare a dime for the Future Tots of America Incorporated. Hey. What the fuck? Hey! Hey buddy. Hey, how you doing? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Cool it, cool it, cool it, cool it, cool it, man. It's me, it's me. Look, look. Stitch? Cool it, man. You're freaking everybody out, okay? It's all right, people. We're playing around over here in the alley. Merry Christmas. Why the hell you all dressed up like this? What are you doing? What the fuck you think I'm doing? I'm fucking Santa Claus. Get your dirty hands off my suit. You're gonna mess it up. This part of your job or something? Yeah, I've been doing it a couple years now. I figured it'd be good to take advantage of the giving nature of the season. You know what I mean? Makes all these assholes feel real good about themselves and makes me a lot of fucking money, you know. I'm telling you. Nobody's got a corner on this shit but me, man. Nobody. I got this fucking shit nailed down. Nobody trying to cut you up over this? Nobody except you, you fucking psycho. You're like third world or some shit carrying around a fucking dinner knife. Yeah, sorry about that. Yeah, you should be, sick piece of shit. Hey, put your beard on, man. There's kids everywhere. Hey lady, that's a pretty big fucking kid. He shouldn't believe in Santa no more anyway. - Hey, fuck you. - Fuck me? Fuck me? Yeah, keep walking. Your mom's a liar, kid. - Santa don't exist. - Fuck you. - Hey man, what's wrong with you, man? - What? This is the shit I gotta fucking deal with all the time. What are you fucking talking about? That-- that woman was a fucking bitch. I mean, pardon my expression but she was a fucking bitch. All right. You know what? Fuck it. Let's get the hell out of here. Between you acting like some crazy kind of fucking butcher and that fucking broad, we just blew this corner. Hope you're fucking happy. Here, help me with my shit. We'll go meet Della Reese. Hey! Come on! Ah, there she is. Nolan, I want you to meet Della Reese. Ain't she a beaut? Yeah, she's something. Damn right she's something. One of these days I'm gonna get enough to get a license plate that says Blue Bitch on it. Damn, Stitch. Yeah, I gotta find a Coinstar to cash this shit in it. Here. Put this shit in the back seat. God, just look at you, man. Just fucking look at you. You know, I look at you, you know what I see? You know what I see? I see a motherfucking Christmas miracle. That's what I fucking see. I mean I don't see you for what five, fucking six years? And all of a sudden out of blue here you fucking are. Don't go telling everybody. Are you kidding? Who the fuck I got to tell? I mean, come on. Really, I got to hand it to you, man. You got some fucking balls doing what you did and coming back to town like this. I mean, shit. I mean, I couldn't do that. I came back for my family. Is that why you did the thing? What thing is that, Stitch? Oh, it ain't nothing. It's just people talking a lot of shit is all. That's all. I mean, it's nothing. I didn't believe a word of it, Nolan. I did what they're saying. You ratted? Got a problem with that, Stitch? - I'm sure you had your reasons. - I do. Look, I'm not in town for long, but I can use a friend. Can I count on you? Shit, man. You know, I'm insulted you even asked me that. I mean, of course. You're the only guy that ever treated me nice and I don't forget that sort of thing, okay? You just tell me what you need, all right. Tell me what you need and you got it. For starters I could use a ride. Now that I can do. Hop in. ¶ Jing a ling a ring Jing a ling a ring ¶ ¶ Jing a ling a ring ¶ ¶ Ding dong ding ¶ ¶ Jing a ling a ring Jing a ling a ring ¶ ¶ Jing a ling a ring Ding dong ding ¶ ¶ Ding dong Ding ding Ding dong Ding ding ¶ ¶ Ding dong Ding ding ¶ Hi, can I help you? I'm here to see Lena. Lena? Hi. Hi. - When did you-- - Today. You look great. Thanks. You look just like you did the day you left. That good, huh? Can we talk? You need to go. Now. Are you gonna come with me? I don't know. It's all right. I know about Donnie. Then why did you come here? I came to take you out of here. How? I got a plan. I really can't do this. Then don't. No, you have to go now. I have a client coming soon. You have to go out the back door. We'll talk about it later. When? I'll meet you in an hour. There's a parking garage across the street. Second floor. Promise me you'll be there. I will. I love you. You have to go. There she is. What are you doing? I was just taking out the trash. We pay people to do that. I don't want you doing that. Why didn't you tell me you were making the drop? I like to surprise you. I would've freshened up. I like you the way you are. Come here. No. What's your problem? I don't want Hannah hearing us. We'll be quiet. If I'm going to run this place, they have to see me as your business partner. You're my wife. At home. Here we're partners. You're right. We're partners. Listen, I... I wanted to come and tell you this myself. They let Nolan out today. What? I'm taking care of it. What does that mean? Don't pretend you don't know what happens next. If he tries to reach out to you, I just don't want you to forget what a good thing you got going for yourself here. He's created a real problem for me. I have to deal with it now. You love me? Say it. I love you. Good. Don't forget that. Christ, it's fucking cold. How long we gotta fucking wait out here? As long as it takes. Jesus Christ. As long as it takes. What are we, some sort of stake out? Hey, you got a cell phone? Man, what do I look like? I'm a fucking business man. Course I got a fucking phone. People got to get a hold of me. Well let me get your number. What for? In case I need to get a hold of you. Man. You know, if the wrong people find you with my number, they're gonna know that I was helping you out, okay? I mean, you're my friend and all, but don't go thinking I'm gonna get myself killed on your account. They won't find it. - Oh yeah? - Let me get it. Let me get it. Fuck. Fine, you know what? Whatever here. There's a fucking pen around here somewhere. Just don't go spreading this shit around, you understand? Getting to be a real high-maintenance favor asker. You know that? Lucky you're such a great friend, right? Goddamn right. Goddamn fucking right. What the fuck? Hey, who the fuck is that? That's Lena. Lena? Fuck me. We can't do this. We missed our chance. No, no, we didn't. This is our chance. I got it all figured out. Let me take you to Iceland. You and Amy. Iceland? You're fucking crazy. No, this-- this is real. See that? You see that house? I found that house. I'm gonna get it for us. We can go there and start over. You wanna buy a farmhouse in Iceland? Yeah. You can raise chickens and shit and Amy can play outside in the fresh air. Amy doesn't know who you are. Let me tell her. Nolan, I'm sorry, but you were supposed to be gone for 10 more years. I had to make decisions and you can't just show up and expect me to drop all of that. We talked about this. I've never said a thing about Iceland. No, no. Not about Iceland. But about getting us out of the city. Getting out of here. You haven't changed at all. Not when it comes to you and me. But I have. You didn't leave me any choice. Is that it? That's the plan? You just cut me out. Is that it? How did you get out? Don't worry 'bout it. You can't tell me not to be worried about it. Donnie checked up on me at work tonight and he never does that. Now you're not supposed to be here. What did you do? I didn't tell them everything. Just enough to get to the door. Oh god. Now you know Donnie and he's not gonna let this go. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That-- that's the man you wanted to father to our child right there? You and that girl are the only people in this world I care about. She's the best thing I've ever done in my life. You don't even know her. Well, I want to. I deserve that, so does she. She has a choir concert tomorrow night. You can come and stand in the back and watch her sing, but that's the best I can do right now. And what about Donnie? He won't be there. He's no more of a father to her than you are right now. Am I supposed to just trust that? If you wanna see her, yeah. Okay, tomorrow then. In case you need to reach me. You were right though, you know. She is the best thing you've ever done and there's nothing wrong with her except us. And I'm just trying really hard to keep it that way. Come on, lover boy. What are you fucking doing? Hey. What the fuck was that? Just gotta lay low for tonight, then I'm out of here. All right, all right. Where to now then? To my place, I guess. No, Dunya's. That's laying low? She owes me a favor. Dunya don't owe people favors, Nolan. She does for me. Fuck me. I-- I don't even wanna imagine what you had to do to get that. You think I can get in on that favor though? Just think about it. Listen to that. Della Reese, you fucking pussycat! Yeah, woo! Let's go to Dunya's! Pussy awaits! Here we are. Smell that? Tell you what. There're a lot of girls on Santa's naughty list. Lot of fucking girls. Here we go! ¶¶¶ ¶ Get up Boy you gotta get up ¶ Well, I know what I came for. I'll be in the back. Don't take too long. Never do. Ha, ha! What will it be? Is Dunya in? She isn't seeing anyone tonight. She's gonna wanna see me. Please. What do you want? I need help. A scarce resource, I'm sure. I came to collect on that favor. You have no favors here. You betrayed us. What I did has got nothing to do with you. It's a social contract. Directed at me or not, you break the contract, it affects the world. All I need is one more day, then I can leave. You always thought you could get away with what others couldn't. I ended a man's life because you asked me to. I didn't ask anything else in return but I'm asking now. Ain't got nowhere else to go. When I was a little girl, my mother told me a story about a man from her village. He had everything. Friends, family, wife, child. Everything a man could want, but it wasn't enough. One day the chance came for him to leave the village and he thought maybe if I left I could find something better. Everyone warned him, leave your home and you lose yourself. But he didn't listen. He left. Years went by and the village didn't hear anything. His wife and child grew old. And finally one day the word came. The man had died in some faraway land. To his wife and child this was a tragedy. Their hearts were broken. But for the man it was a fate far worse than that of a lonely death. What they didn't know was he had tried a long time to get back home. So in death, he rose up, and his ghost made the long journey back to the village. His heart was filled with joy. He went to the house where his wife and child were and he knocked. Tat, tat, tat. Tat. But they didn't answer. So he went around to the window where his wife and child slept and again he knocked tat, tat, tat. Tat. Still no answer. Sad but still hopeful, he went to his mother's house. And he knocked. Tat, tat, tat. Tat. She didn't answer. In desperation, he went to every house in the village. All through the night up and down the street knocking at every door but no one heard his knocking. He had turned his back on his home, on the life that he had. And now here you are. Tat, tat, tat. Tat. On my door. But I can't hear you. You are a ghost. They're gonna kill me. Yes. The choice to die, that is the only favor I will grant you. Tell me. Why did you come back here? For my daughter. This is why I sell love. There's no price too high for those afflicted. How they know I'm here? I don't know. I'll talk to them, but you've gotta get out the back. I don't want this fight in my house. What room is this? Second floor, end of the hall. Who is that? My ride. Oh my God. What the fuck? Get the fuck out of here, man. ¶¶¶ - We gotta go. - Fuck, man. What the fuck, Nolan? I had to pop a fucking stiffy pill. Just started getting good. - Monty and Bull. We got to go now. - Fuck. All right ladies, you're both coming with me, all right. I paid for the night and this stiffy here ain't gonna fix itself, okay? - Now. - What? Just cool it, man. Let 'em get their shit, all right. - Put it on. - Fuck. All right, fuck. You heard the man, chop chop. - This bitch is crazy. - Come on, ladies. Let's be quick about it here. We're taking this little party off campus. - Mitzie, grab your fucking shit. - We're going. Move. Get your fucking hands off me. Keep it moving. Come on, keep it moving. - Come on. Come on. - Move. Come on. If we go out the back, can we get to the front parking lot? I think through the alley. Do you think or do you know? I do. You can get out that way. Show me. Nolan, where'd you get the fucking gun? Where'd you get the piece? Nolan. Move. At least it's an upgrade from your fucking dinner knife. - Nolan, I swear to god this better be fucking good. - Come on. Nolan, I paid good money for this fucking shit. You had to fucking interrupt-- I'm not going on some wild ride. I don't know what you guys are into. Shut up! You're gonna fucking love it. - I don't love anything for free. - Fuck, fine, whatever. I'll throw in some extra scratch. Come on. - Come on. - Come on. Got the keys? - Keys! - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fuck, I think I left it upstairs or something. - Merry Christmas, Santa. - Thank you. - We got 'em, I got 'em. - Come on. I'm fucking rock hard right now! Fuck! Start the car. - There's nowhere to sit. - Fuck. Fuck. Why is there a Christmas tree? 'Cause it's fucking Christmas. Get in. Come on, come on, come on, get in. What the fuck, Nolan? Get in. Move, move. What the fuck? - Go, go, go. - Let's get the fuck out of here. Goddamn, your elbow's fucking hitting me in my fucking side. Yahoo, motherfuckers! Fuck, man. I knew we were going fucking rodeo and shit, Nolan. You still got it, man. You still fucking got it. Geez, what did I say? I told you we're gonna have some fun, right ladies? Fuck. Yeah, where we going, Stitch? Fuck, man, I don't know. Fuck away. I don't got no fucking plan. I thought you were leading this fucking rodeo. We gotta get off the street. All right, well let's fucking go to my place then. Is it safe? Yeah sure, why wouldn't it be? It's my place. Monty and Bull, do they know where you live? I doubt it. It's a yes or no, Stitch. No. What kind of trouble are you in? If you were worried about that, you shouldn't have got in the car. Fine, pull over. - Tanya, baby, come on. - No, no, no. - You just got into the car. - We're having a good time-- I don't know what the fuck you got me into, but he's not being very nice - and I don't think I wanna stay. - You're staying. Pull over. No. Let 'em out. - No, I'm not gonna fucking pull over. - You better fucking pull over. Oh yeah? Or fucking what? I'm gonna fucking freak the fuck out. - Pull over the goddamn car. - Hey, hey, hey shut the fuck up. All of you, shut up. Now I'm fucking driving. I'm gonna do whatever the fuck I want. Now you're killing the fucking mood. Now ladies, I paid for a fucking night. Right? And I should get my fucking night. Right? And where I get it, I don't give a shit. All you need to know about this guy right here that he's a bad ass motherfucker. He just got out of fucking prison. He's got a couple guys that wanna talk to him, but we're going to my place and they ain't gonna be there, so just chill the fuck out. Who the fuck is this? - Fuck, man. - Pull over. Dude, we just went over this fucking shit. - Come on-- - Pull the damn car over. All right, all right, fuck, fuck. Fine, I'm pulling over. Jesus Christ, fuck. Jesus fucking Christ. Hey! Lena? I can't talk long. Are you all right? I wanna go with you. Nolan? I'm here. Tomorrow night after the choir concert, okay? We'll be ready. Okay, so you changed your mind? I like your plan. Though I wish you'd picked some place warmer. You like the cold. Since when? Something I know about you. I have to get off the phone. Okay. Tomorrow then. Tomorrow night. I love you. I love you, too. All right, all right. The fuck was that, man? What the fuck? - Go, go, go. - Jesus fucking Christ. I swear to god, Nolan. Fucking swear to God you keep dragging us down with this shit. I mean, the ad said a real fixer upper, right. I mean, but-- I mean, who cares about that? I don't give a fuck about that. I mean, it's all about character, right? I mean, it's fucking amazing. Look all around. You know what I see? You know what I see? That's fucking character is what that fucking is. It's just like fucking Della Reese, right? Because of all the-- Hey, watch that banister now. You're gonna fucking hit the banister. This is fucking antique. That shit don't come cheap. Now I'm gonna have to repair this shit. I just fucking moved in the place. You're not even paying us for this. You're right. You know what? I'm not paying you for this. I'm paying to get my fucking dick wet, but I lost my fucking stiffy due to your attitude on the ride over here. - Come on. - Get with it. This thing's poking me. Damn tree's getting what I paid for. Here, see? Home sweet you know what. You live here? Where are we supposed to fuck? Oh, shit. Here, check this out. Look at this, huh. Will you look at this? Presto change-o. It's a pull out. You get the idea. You can fuck anywhere. How long you lived here? Not too long, you know. Just still trying to make place feel like home, you know. Yeah, I can see that. Hey relax. Come on. We got booze. We got girls over here. I mean, we-- we got everything we need to throw ourselves one hell of a little Christmas party, huh? Am I right? ¶ It's Christmas ¶ ¶ I can hear sleigh bells In the snow ¶ ¶ We're walking hand in hand ¶ ¶ Holding each other close ¶ What's your craziest jail story? Man, he doesn't wanna talk about jail. He just got out of the motherfucker. What's your craziest jail story? - You're rude. You know that? - You know what? I don't gotta be a gentleman 'cause I'm paying you. That's the whole fucking point. What's the worst thing that happened to you in lady prison 'cause I know you were locked up? Can we talk about something different? What do you think a five-year-old girl would want for Christmas? You're asking whores? Fuck you. They know more than you do. Hey, Santa don't have to ask. He fucking knows. You have a little girl? Yeah. ¶ Love is in the air ¶ ¶ Feeling special Knowing that you're there ¶ She's beautiful. I'm gonna meet her for the first time tomorrow. A girl needs her daddy. I didn't have a dad and I turned out just fine. Yeah, you sure did, sweetie except, for the whoring. Ah, Christ. You know what? Fuck all this shit. You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking I gotta brainstorm. I'm thinking we try picking up from where we left off earlier. What do you say? I can be ready in two seconds. Two shakes of a fucking lamb's tail. I can be up like... P-p-p. Just like that. What do you guys think? Can one of you take care of my friend Nolan over here? I mean, it's Christmas after all, right. No, thanks. I'll get out of your way. - Prison turn you into a homo or something? - Hey, watch your fucking mouth. This guy's just got a lot on his mind is all. What you fucking waiting for? Go keep him company. ¶ I thank you, thank you, thank You Christmastime is here ¶ I'm sorry about what I said, okay? You mind? Knock yourself out. Took me awhile to get used to pissing in front of somebody when I was locked up. Yeah well, I got guys who pay me for it, so I got over that pretty quick. Got another one of those cigarettes? Out in my purse. You mind? Thanks. How you like working for Dunya? It's okay. She's good to us. Yeah, even when she ain't, she one of the better ones, right? I heard that about you, too. What you know about me? I know that the guys you're running from are the kind of guys who will kill you and chop you up into little pieces. Stuff like that. Why'd you come with? Something different. Plus everyone knows we're Dunya's girls, so no one messes with us. Yeah, before I went in, I used to be one of the guys that helped make sure of that, right. I remember. You don't look old enough to remember. I wasn't working then like I am now, but I was around. Plus I had a dad who wasn't around much, so my mom worked. You turned out okay. Bet you wouldn't want your daughter to grow up like me. Is that how-- how come you came back? She the only good thing I ever done in my life. I told myself if I had the chance, I'd give her the life I never had, even if it's the last thing I do. I hope it isn't. Yeah, me too. You wanna? No. Why don't you take the night off? Good morning. Hey. Are they still out there? Yeah, sleeping. It fucking stinks in here. Let's get out of here. No, I'm trying to stay off the street. Come on. No one you know will be up right now. You should enjoy your freedom. I'll get my clothes. I've seen a lot of weird guys, but that guy's seriously one of the weirdest. All the girls talk about him when he comes in. Give the poor guy a break, okay. I mean, you ladies are the closest thing he'll ever come to finding love. Why is he all cut up like that? Stitch is a survivor. When he was younger, he made a few mistakes. People just cut him up, teach him a lesson. After while he became a joke. I've seen people cut him up just for fun. - That's fucked up. - Yeah. He's all right. Like a cockroach. Motherfucker would survive Armageddon. Just be nice to him, all right? You think this is what normal people do? Like get up and go get coffee? Yeah, see what you missing out on? I don't know. Seems kind of nice. What? Being normal. Having a job. Having a family. Living in the real world. This is the real world. Isn't that what you're looking for? Something like that. - Got any more of them cigarettes? - Hm. You can keep the pack. I get an unlimited supply at Dunya's. One of the perks of the job. Yeah, read the fine print better next time. When are you meeting your daughter? Tonight. Her mother invited me to her choir concert. Do you know what you're gonna get her? I can help you pick something out. No. No, I'd-- I'd like to. I wish my dad would've done something like that for me when I was a kid. It'll be fun. Let's go. Can you believe how much people pay for this shit? A thirty-dollar animal costs fifty cents to make. She's gonna love it. It's from her dad. Now we need to find you something to wear. What's wrong with what I'm wearing? We only get one first impression. You should wear something nice like a tie or something. Yeah, well I spent all my money on this little shit. So? So? I'm trying to do this right. I don't wanna go stealing clothes to meet my daughter in. Then I'll do it. What size are you? This is-- - I'll be right back. - Happening. Okay. Okay. Wow. Okay. What'd you get me? You have to try it on. Make sure it fits. Oh yeah? Think I like it. Very good, okay. This one. And last but not least. Nope, nope, not wearing it. That is a fucking noose. Come on. It's gonna look so nice. You're gonna look like a college teacher or something. Come on. Since you went through the trouble, I'll do it. Alrighty, alrighty, let's see. It's been a while since I did this. - Right? - Yup, and then that goes through. There. Let me see that picture of your family again. See? Now you look like you can be in there with them. You're gonna be so happy. You got a way of making a guy forget about his troubles. You know that? Well, that's what they pay me for. - This the part where you bill me? - No. This one's on me. You're trying to be a good guy. I don't see a lot of that. But maybe you'd wanna come and see me before you go. Another place, another time maybe. Yeah. I gotta go. I hope you find what you're looking for tonight. I'd be really happy if you were my dad. Take care of yourself. Jesus Christ. Hey, man. What happened? It's that fucking whore Tanya. She went fucking crazy on me after you left. She pulled a fucking razor on me. Why? Ow. Fuck. She was-- she was fucking pissed 'cause I tried to pay in change. I told her. I tried to say, hey man, you know it all spends the same. You know? She fucking came after me. I guess I've seen worse, huh? Let me take a look at that, all right? I'm getting really sick of this shit. You know that's one of the reasons I always liked you. No matter how mad I made you, you never cut me once and I know everybody's always trying to cut me up all the time and I know-- I know I've done a lot of things to try to piss you off, Nolan, but you never did and that's-- that's why I think you're such a nice guy. Let's get you cleaned up, all right? It's the same man, all right. Come over here. Hold your head over the sink. Come on. All right. This is gon' burn. I know. - Just fucking do it. - All right.
