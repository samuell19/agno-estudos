Now that your husband has passed away and you being pregnant, what do you take me for? What a good child. Come. Please move a little. I have a pair of golden earrings. You can take them as collateral for the debt. -If anyone dares to harass or bully you, -The hawker inspectors are here. tell me. I will stand up for you. Okay? There's tension between the races now. Stop talking nonsense. I was treated like a pig. Now that I'm out, you want me to raise pigs? It's fine if you don't want to do it. It doesn't cost you anything to be kind. You can take over then. After the flood, Mom took over the farming permit from Grandpa and ended her soymilk business. The family worked hard in front of our lawn and built a pigsty. Even though we used only old wood, after we were done, it became a new pigsty. I just blinked and they're almost done. Dad and Ah Xi helped, so it gets done faster. What are the three rascals doing? Others are working, so why are they such busybodies? - Get them back here. - It is fine. They have nothing to do back at home. What are you three doing? I don't want you to raise pigs when you grow up, yet you are there meddling. Come back home. I told you not to help. Go and do your homework. Mom. Will we be able to feed our family just by raising pigs? Why not? We don't even have pigs in our pigsty. Tomorrow, I will go visit my ninth aunt to get money. When we have money, we can buy piglets. Then they will grow up to sow. After that, the sows will give birth to piglets, then we can sell the piglets. We'll work harder and do more odd jobs. We can earn at least a few hundred dollars a month. We won't starve. I'm more concerned about the situation if we have to move out. We can't farm, raise pigs, or poultry. When that time comes, we'll really starve. We're comfortable living here, Mom. Why do we need to move into apartments? The government is developing to improve our country. It'll be great if we live in apartments too. We don't have to be scared of fire. The Ho Swee Hill fire a few years back was horrifying. All the straw and wooden stilt houses were razed to the grounds. Everybody wept their eyes out. It was too pitiful. Zhao Di. There is a hole in the roof. Aren't you going to repair it? Are you waiting for it to become a pool before you fix it? - I have to persuade and beg. - Coming. I'll fix it right now. Mom, Uncle stays in the same house too, why can't he fix it himself? We are a family. We should help one another. We must not be calculative. Do you understand me? Also, we don't need to be scared of leaks when we live in apartments. Xihe All my money got conned out by her. That's right. She's always so well-dressed. It turns out that it's only for show. She ran away with my life savings. Mine too. - What happened? - The Chairman is missing. He ran away? - What about the money? - What money? It's all gone. She tricked us all. Zhao Di. Ah Long. I just got out of jail. This is my mom. You were cheated of your money too? You too? I thought with the accumulated funds, I could get piglets. My plans are ruined now. Me too. I haven't been able to get a job since I just got out of jail. My mom wanted to get some money for me to start a business and raise some funds. I didn't expect we would be conned instead. She'd better not let me find her. This is my retribution. Goddess Guanyin, my pigsty is done, but the Chairman has run away. I have no more money to buy pigs. Goddess Guanyin, if you are efficacious, please help me by granting me a few pigs. Help my family. Pigs! - The Goddess made her presence. - No. It's Ah Long. Yes, the Goddess answered. If not, where would the pigs come from? Ah Long. Ah Long? The pigs... Did you buy them? No. Our family's sow just gave birth to a dozen of piglets. As for these four... How could I accept them? I am just placing them under your care. When they give birth to piglets, just return four pigs to me. Will that be okay? We won't be owing each other then. Thank you, Ah Long. Do you want some sugarcane? There's another packet here. A treat for your children. Thank Ah Long for those. - Thank you. - Good. Is it your first time raising pigs? Are you still in 706? I left the gang. With the government's sweeping operation, everyone ran away. That's great. Be an honest man. What are your future plans? I didn't study and I'm illiterate. I can only do unskilled labor. I am working at a coal factory now. Coal factory? Do they hire females? - They do. Are you interested? - Yes. - It is very dirty. - No problem. How can raising pigs be enough? - Let me arrange it. - Okay. Thank you. Zhao Di, it rained last night. Our roof started to leak again. Ah Kun asked you to fix it. - All right, I'll be right over. - Sorry for the trouble. Fragrant flowers of spring The sun is shining warmly Unto my tattered clothes Busying down the streets Have to work all day for a living One still needs to eat, though poor A place to stay Even if the Madam were to give a strange look White Phoenix Pill Essence of Chicken Poverty doesn't befall for no reason Iron gets refined to steel with perseverance As long as we put in the effort Even the unscalable high mountains are not to be feared I met a fair lady A dear lady An innocent lady There is no need to be sorrowful Life is just like a battlefield With health and strength We strive to do our best With health and strength Let us strive For the best The year 1972 - Bakkwa. - There's no time. I still need to get the New Year groceries. Hurry up, Shun Fa. Mom, bakkwa. Ma'am, it's New Year. Have some bakkwa. Okay. Give me a catty. Ah Cheng, one catty of bakkwa. Thank you, sir. Let's go. This place is not for you to sing. Ma'am. - You are... - Ahmad. Ahmad? It has been so long. Your hair is longer now. This is the latest trend. Trend? Why are you here? I'm waiting for a friend to get a haircut. Is your dad not happy with it? Ahmad. Coming. My friend is calling. Rooster One box of soda water. I heard that the year-end bonus at the coal factory is generous. So, buy even more. Mom, I want some firecrackers to light during the New Year. No, it's expensive and dangerous. - I don't have much cash. - I want it! Don't be naughty. Bakkwa and firecrackers. Do you think I print money? I still have to give red packets to Si Shu and Aunt and all the children. After the New Year, I still have to buy pigs to raise. Money spent on firecrackers will be gone once they are lit. It's a waste of money. You're not allowed to buy it. Come. Ah Hee. Let me tell you, Aunt won't buy it. She's stingy. Don't even think about it. You're here to get firecrackers too? We don't need to buy. Firecrackers will fall from the sky for us. During New Year, could you share them with me? Why should we? We don't even have enough for ourselves. That's right. Let's go fly kites. - Catching spiders is more interesting. - Let's go. Hassan. - What happened to you? - Circumcision. - Circumcision? - It got cut. It got cut? Your "little bird" got cut? So you're a girl now? No, I didn't cut it. I only cut the skin. Now, I'm a big boy. - You don't look so happy. - Yes. Chinese New Year is coming, but my mom won't buy me firecrackers. Firecrackers? Don't worry. Follow me. Hurry. It's on top. Get it yourself. Hassan, why do you have so many firecrackers? My cousin gave them to me. Hassan, time for prayers. Come. My dad is calling. Just take some and go. Hurry up. You're limping away. I can't. It hurts. You're in pain? Stop pretending. Your dad here did it twice. The first time, I didn't do a clean job, so I did it again. - I didn't cry then. - Enough. Just a small matter and you're complaining? It'll be New Year soon. Hurry and help with the cleaning. Clean here. And here too. Silly girl, you can't sweep outwards. I've said it so many times. This is good fortune. You have to sweep them in. Grandma, this is clearly rubbish. This is not rubbish. During Chinese New Year, they're symbols of good fortune. You can only sweep inwards, not outwards. Got it? I've repeated myself countless times. All right, I'll sweep them inwards. - Where is Ahmad? - I don't know. You don't know? Doesn't he know that it's prayer time? He always disappears when it is time for prayers. I haven't seen him in a long time. "I seek refuge in Allah from the outcast Shaitan." Ali, please begin. Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar! Ali, from the beginning. Fatimah, what is that? I don't know. Prayers are starting. Who is that? Your child? I don't know. Ahmad, is that you? I really don't know. Ahmad! Devil's child. Ahmad! Dear. Dear, calm down. Don't be rash. You, shut up! Don't blame me for being harsh. Oh God, please forgive me! What is this? Where is Ahmad? How long has it been since I last saw you? Why is your hair like a nest? - This is fashion. - You called this fashion? How can you play this evil instrument? Do you want to be controlled by the devil? I love singing. We're forming a band. Is that wrong? You still dare to talk back? Welcoming the return of spring The flowers are blooming brightly The grasslands are like a green carpet The swallows return to their nests And whisper their love to each other The earth renews its look The butterflies fluttering gracefully The bees busily collecting pollen Couples enjoying the warm breeze What a moving spring scene Let's set firecrackers to kickstart a prosperous new year. The stream flows with clear water Spring comes round Showcasing The classic scenic beauty The birds chirping continuously Everything looks afresh Welcoming the return of spring The butterflies fluttering gracefully The bees busily collecting pollen Couples enjoying the warm breeze What a moving spring scene Why is there bakkwa? Ah Kun, you bought the bakkwa? Bakkwa? Yes, I bought it. Without you driving the taxi, we won't be able to savor this. If you were still selling vegetables, we would only have dried bean curds. Now you understand the hardships of being a taxi driver. - Don't. - Pass them around. - It's New Year, a happy occasion. - Pass the scissors. Congratulations on the new year It's the new year, year after year The sound of firecrackers reminds us of the past Congratulations on the new year It's the new year, year after year Time flies in the blink of an eye Think of the past... Ah Xi, what are you doing? Are you praying on the first day of Lunar New Year? I am praying to the deities, so that I'll win the lottery. Then we can move into a bungalow. Did you pick up gambling habits from Ah Kun? No, he gave me a lottery ticket. He gave you a lottery ticket as a red packet? What? Can't I do that? I'm doing a good deed. Money is needed for the government to build our National Stadium, so I bought 50 tickets and placed them in red packets. Whoever gets my red packet and wins 400 thousand dollars, will definitely be able to get the prize money. My red packet, Lim Ah Kun's red packet, will be the biggest red packet in Singapore. Ah Xi, when will you be giving out red packets? No one wants me. Do you have any recommendations? No one? How about this? I will help you to arrange it. Aunt, let me tell you. The next village has girls who are looking for a husband. - Is that so? - I saw them. There are two of them with huge bottoms. - Really? - Yes. It's good. They will definitely give birth to many children. - Yes. - Huge bottom. We like that. - Okay. - That's not okay. Aunt Cai Gan, why don't you let me find my own wife? Those with big bottoms are bound to be plump or a bit slow. Ah Xi, listen to me. The fortune-teller said that I have bad luck this year. My health isn't like what it used to be. I hope for some happy occasions at home to lighten the mood so I can get better. - Did you hear that? - Mom, I don't want that. Dad. Mom. Since he doesn't want it, let me. Ah Xi is my younger brother. If he doesn't want to, let your eldest son have it. I will get a second wife. Dear, what are you talking about? I am the eldest son, right? I might get five or six more grandchildren for Dad to counter his bad luck. Getting a second wife? Why don't I do it myself? I can recover and enjoy at the same time. - I'm not dead yet. - I'm just joking. It's not funny. Get Shun Fa to greet the guests. - May you be prosperous. - May you be prosperous. Shun Fa, what are you doing? We're fighting. Move away. Quick. Let them know my prowess. You cannot play like this. Ah Hai, stop it. It's dangerous. Look. It went into our house. Did you ruin my bonsai? Uncle, it's not Shun Fa. It's Ah Hai and the rest... You still dare to talk back? Why did you hit my children? How could you? The children know nothing. Really? They used rockets to damage my bonsai. Those were given to me by the British soldiers. Even if you have money, you can't replace it. It really wasn't Shun Fa! Ah Hai was hiding in the pigsty, launching the rockets. Pigsty? Ah Hai, you get out here! - Get out here! Out now! - We are here. Can you see that? They came out of the house. That's not true! You were clearly over there just now. - No. - Stop accusing us. Where were the three of you just now? We were playing at the back of the kitchen. Did you hear that? They were at the back of the kitchen playing. Are their firecrackers that great? Just release them from the backyard, and they can find their way to the front to blow up my bonsai? This is a rocket, not radio waves. You cannot just fire them as you wish. Zhao Di, why did you buy such dangerous things for the kids? I didn't buy these. I did. I thought it would make them happy for the New Year. I didn't know that they would take my... But I didn't buy these. The ones I bought are bigger. These are different. Who gave you this? - Hassan gave it to me. - I knew it. The rockets I buy fire towards the sky. Hassan's rockets shot towards our house. Listen to me. Excuse me. Allow me to say a few words. What are you doing here? Let me say a few words in fairness. What "few words in fairness"? When I was passing by, I saw these three rascals playing with firecrackers there. Be a man and own up to what you did. Be a man? I'll be a woman then. I'm just being fair. - Ah Long, is what you said the truth? - Yes, every word of it. Did you hear that? It's your children. Don't simply accuse mine. You three, why didn't you own up to your mistake? Shun Fa got slapped by your dad for no reason. - It wasn't us. - It wasn't us. Stop scolding my children in front of relatives on the first day of the Lunar New Year. I'm warning you. Didn't you also slap my child just now? We are now... Let's not talk about your child first. I'm talking about you scolding my children today. You... Ah Kun, it's the first day of the Lunar New Year. Stop bickering. Did you hit her son? I said let's not talk about her child. Let's settle the problem of her scolding my children first. She is my older sister. Do you know how to act like one? Look. Before she moved back in, we never had any problems setting off firecrackers. Now that she's back, our house almost got blown up. Do you know how to be an older sister? You said it. It's the first day of the Lunar New Year. Our relatives and neighbors are all here. With you making a scene, it's embarrassing. Stop talking. Pack up and leave. - Uncle, that's not true. - Stop. Shut up! Return to your room now. Go! Kids, back to your rooms. Don't come out. Hurry! Were you not looking after your brother? If not, he wouldn't be slapped by your uncle. Mom, I wasn't playing. I did look out for him. You're still talking back? If you were watching out for him, would he get hit then? Uncle slapped me too. You deserve it! What kind of older sister are you? What kind of older sister are you? Mom. Mom, let me ask you. Mom. Am I your biological child? Or was I picked up from the dump? Why must my life as an older sister be so tough? This is your life as an older sister. Malaysia's Traditional Herbal Medicated Oil Mom, it hurts. Su Ting. All right, get over there. Su Ting, come here. Bear with it. When I'm not around, take care of your brother. He's the only guy in our family. Mom, I need to go to the toilet. Take him to the toilet. No need. I've grown up. I'll go on my own. If you have, all my efforts would have paid off. Okay, you can go. I'll go do the laundry. Be careful, all right? Bakkwa? For you. To cure your pain. Cure my pain? I need to go to the toilet. Wait, you're going alone? I've grown up. I'm not scared. All right. Be careful. Come. Hurry. Oh no, is there a ghost? Open the door. Stop playing! Open the door! Su Ting, help me! The door's stuck. Su Ting, help me open the door! - Help, Su Ting. Hurry up! - I'm coming. - Su Ting! - What happened? Su Ting, open the door. I'm scared. Don't panic. Use your strength. Put in all your might. Su Ting, help me. A ghost is pulling the door. - Su Ting, I'm scared. - It's not a ghost. The door's stuck. All right, stop crying. I'm coming over. Gosh, I stepped on poop. I'm coming in now. Don't be afraid. Why don't you sing to be brave? - Ghost! The ghost is climbing up! - It's not a ghost. It's me. Don't cry. It's all right now. I'll open the door for you. Be good. Su Ting, you're very smelly. Thank you. Zhao Di. I applied to be a ticket collector and I succeeded. Look. The letter is here. That is great. With CPF, I'll have no worries when I apply for a apartment. That's great. If only I had CPF, I would be able to get an apartment and move out since Ah Kun and Si Shu can't stand me. I'm useless. I didn't study and I'm illiterate. Don't bother about them. They have to ask me before they can get you to leave. He's too much. Our parents and I are still here. I have a share in this house too. Ah Xi, any good movies recently? There is. Bruce Lee's The Big Boss. It's very good. He can do three kicks in the air. He is known as "Lee Three Kicks." Why do you ask that? You want to watch a movie? Help me get five tickets. Bring Ah Hai, Shun Fa, and the rest to watch it. Buy three more for my daughters to go as well. Mom, I don't want to watch it. I'll watch it when it plays in our village. Each ticket will cost 20 cents then. It doesn't matter. Go and watch it together. If you were to do this, Ah Kun would despise you more. Zhao Di, are you fine? I'm okay. I'm just feeling a bit dizzy. We live together, so it's not good to argue all the time. I was wrong to lecture his children too. He slapped Su Ting and Shun Fa first. You didn't even scold him. You only lectured him. You didn't blame him, but he complained first. We must not be calculative. What matters most is that our family is happy, safe, and healthy. Do you understand? You guys are such a disgrace. We are a family, but you only know how to bully the weak. Aren't you ashamed? You're his older cousins. Little Rascals Shun Fa. I apologize for what happened that day. - It's okay. - Let me treat you to a soda drink. - You still have them? - Of course. Don't let Aunt see it. - Drink this at the back of the house. - Let's go. You think it's even just by buying three movie tickets? Zhao Di. Why don't you move out? Otherwise, in the future, if we fall out, wouldn't it be worse? You'd better move. Ah Kun, we've been staying here for so long. Where do you want my family to move to? You are capable and healthy. How would I know? Why are you asking me? Don't be so harsh. She already bought movie tickets. Let's call it even. Call it even? She scolded my sons in front of the relatives on New Year. I was humiliated. "Call it even"? You slapped Shun Fa. It's not a slap. It is a wipe. Do you understand what that is? You hit Su Ting too. That's right. You slapped me too. That's not true. What do a girl like you know? That is a rub. Do you get the meaning of "rub"? I don't care about any movie tickets. That is Bruce Lee's The Big Boss. It's difficult to get tickets. Children love to watch that. Haven't you heard of Bruce Lee losing and becoming Bum Lee? My children will like that? Do you know what my children like? They like the television. Buy a television set or else, there's nothing to talk about. Move. A television? Where would I get the money? Your coal factory boss told the whole village you received a two-month year-end bonus. Isn't that money? Cut the crap. A television set. If not, you move. Okay. It's okay now. Done. Tune it. It isn't clear. Still unclear? Tune it further. - Okay, now? - Not yet. Tune it further. What kind of television is this? It's never clear. Tune it, just a bit more. More? My hands are aching from tuning this. Are we done? It's still not clear. A bit more. - Is it clear now? - Yes. - Are you sure? - Yes. Wang Sha. Ye Feng. - It's starting. - Everyone says I look like Wang Sha. Crazy. How is it possible in eight words? - Listen up. - Okay. Who is? It's me. Do what? Drink wine. We thank the comedic duo for their wonderful skit. Next, we go into the Q&A. - Wheel of Fortune. - This one is funny. 100 catties of cotton and 100 catties of metal, which is heavier? He's asking such a silly question. What was the question? 100 catties of metal and 100 catties of cotton, which is heavier? Do you need to ask? It's obviously metal, right? It's obvious. Metal is heavier than cotton. The correct answer is they are of the same weight. - That doesn't make sense. - That doesn't make sense. Metal is obviously heavier. They're ridiculous. Let me be the host. I'll definitely be better than you. Uncle. You really look like Zhang Wei. You really do. I think when Zhang Wei ages, he'll look like you. How is that possible? If someone like Zhang Wei were to be my age, he wouldn't be as handsome as me. There are tons of fashionable girls outside asking me to go dancing with them. - Is that even possible? - What do you know? He looked like this when he was younger. No, they say I resemble him more. His looks are totally out of this world. Did you think the wall would keep you safe? Mortien. Mom, I am hungry. How much longer must we wait? It's the first time Ah Xi's bringing his girlfriend home. Just wait a little longer. Dear, I did not expect the usually quiet Ah Xi to have a girlfriend, and he is afraid we'll find out. Youngsters these days. If the girlfriend that he brings back is to our liking, we'll send out the wedding invitations immediately. We'll need to have at least 30 to 40 tables. Let's make it 100 tables. Those around our neighborhood, acquaintances or not, we'll invite them all. There is nothing to lose. - Are you sure? - Of course. Won't we be inviting too many people? - No. - That fast? Father, getting a daughter-in-law is different from selling pigs. If I wait any longer, I won't be able to see my grandchildren. I am already in my seventies. Don't talk inauspiciously. Do you remember? When Ah Kun got married, our guests lined up all the way to the village entrance. It was stylish and cheap. Right? When we move to the apartments, everything will become expensive. Youngsters these days. Youngsters want to get married Without a wife, life would be miserable Getting a wife without preparation... Ah Kun. An Indian wife... Dad. Mom. This is my girlfriend. Sit down first. Let's eat. My parents. The one I love, the one I hold dear Where are you, just where are you? Sir, hello. This is for you. Ah Xi, you have learned to dress like the others. Bruce Lee is all the rage now. Bruce Lee? He lost the fight and became Bum Lee. He lost and went crazy. Is the sun in our house so bright that you need shades? Youngsters now have to hold hands even during a meal. Are you afraid she'll run off? Ah Xi, your girlfriend looks familiar. I think I've met her before. I remember it now. She's the female staff at the Ministry's Office. She took us to the officer and helped with Ah Kun's early release. You have a good memory. That is her. That was already a few years ago. You have been together for some time? After that session with the officer, we met a few times outside. It was fate. So I took the opportunity to ask her out. It was like that... And we fell in love. I was the matchmaker then. Luckily, I got caught by the police. If not for that, you wouldn't have met each other. I am telling you, if you get married, don't expect a gift from me. You'll have to give me a red packet. Thank you, Ah Kun. I'll give you a big red packet. - Do as promised, okay? - Yes. Eat. What are we waiting for? Let's chat while we eat. Ah Xi, how do you say eat in English? - "Eat." - One? Won't "swallow" be "two" then? What about "pui"? It's "spit." Pui is "pui." What "spit"? - Let's "one." - One. - You haven't introduced us. - That's right. She is Rani. - He is my dad. - Hi, sir. - My mom. - Hi, ma'am. - He's my brother. - Hi, sir. - My sister. - Hi, ma'am. - And my sister-in-law. - Hi, ma'am. Ah Xi, I don't understand English but it's so strange. Why does she address your brother and me as "sir," and your mom, sister, and sister-in-law as "ma'am"? I think she has no respect for us. This has nothing to do with her. English works this way. No difference in seniority. Now, we say it's how English works. Should something crop up in the future, will you say that it's the way of Indians? Won't things become complicated? We have a problem. If she marries into our family, we can't communicate. We won't understand what she says. When her parents speak, we won't understand either. - Won't there be chaos? - Yes. - Don't bother. Let's eat. - What did they say? Tell me the truth. Rani! You wanted me to tell you the truth. I told you the truth and now you're unhappy. I'm not unhappy because of you. It's because of your father and brother. No. They like to talk rubbish. The whole village talks like this. They don't mean it. Come on. You forgot something. I understand a bit of Hokkien. Ah Xi! Your girlfriend forgot her handbag. Your handbag. Ah Xi, tell her not to be angry. Si Shu and Ah Kun like to talk nonsense. They don't mean it. I just told her and she... She doesn't believe me. You tell her not to take it to heart. - Tell her now... - Ma'am. I can understand some Hokkien. Are you okay? I'm not okay. You don't understand how I feel. How can you say that? Yes. How would you feel if my parents treat you the same way your father and your brother did? I think you should experience it. I think you should meet my parents. Okay. Let's go. I'm ready anytime. - So Rani, this is your house? - Yes. Where is your father? I think he's behind, cutting grass. Do you think he will treat me like how my dad and brother treated you? Why? Now you're scared? - I'm not. What is there to fear? - Come. - I'll call my mother. - Okay. - Are these your family photos? - Yes The hawker inspectors are here. -Rani -Yes? Come. Faster. - This is your father? - Yes. - Shamugen? - Yes. You know him? - That inspector? - He was. Why so unlucky? Dad, he's the friend I spoke of. This is him. Rani, close the door. Why? What for? I said close the door. You're dating my daughter? Because you want to take revenge on me? No, I truly love your daughter. I didn't know she was your daughter, and you were her father. What is going on, Dad? Do you know it? This was the idiot who beat me up - and I ended up in hospital for two weeks. - Catch us if you can. When he was beating me up, he shouted the slogan of other gangs. So the police arrested the other gangs but not him. He's such a bad person. He beat me up until I lost two of my teeth. Look. - It's still there. - I fixed them back. Okay, sir. I'm sorry. I admit when I was younger, I really did hate you. But that's because you always disturbed us and the other hawkers at the market. But, after I punched you at the market, - I've already forgiven you. - Forgive? Let me beat you now and then forgive you. Dad, don't do anything to him. Let me tell you something, Rani. You better break up with this idiot. And take him out of this house immediately. Before I kill him! Okay. Go. Why are you so angry all the time? Can you shut up and go to the kitchen? Is that all you can say? I think your father is a bigger problem than mine. What about my stomach? I don't think we have a choice. Let's go. Pregnant again? Didn't you do what I taught? When you do wrestling at night... Wrestling? You know, wrestling. Did you use the balloon at all? If you used the balloon, you wouldn't get pregnant. If you got pregnant, did you not teach him? Whatever you've taught me, I've told him. It's simple. Just like this. You slip it on. I don't put it on my middle finger. I put it on my thumb after I slipped it on. Then we wrestled. Goodness, gracious. Is that wrong? Faster. Faster. Miss. Fill out the form. Abortion, right? Is it dangerous? Abortions are safe these days. - Don't be so loud. - Keep it down. There's nothing to fear. They are government doctors. Ah Xi? Osman? Zhao Di? Please talk over there. We need to work here. Your girlfriend is pregnant? You also slipped the balloon on your finger? - Balloon? - Stop your nonsense, dear. Why didn't you tell me she was pregnant? I couldn't bring myself to. You? Why are you here? I'm getting medicine for Shun Fa. No. You saw the doctor too. Kids shouldn't speak carelessly. - Are you unwell? - No, he is speaking gibberish. She is pregnant now, Ah Xi. If Si Shu, Aunt, and her parents knew maybe we can still negotiate. Negotiate? Impossible. We listened to you and went to meet her dad. - Do you know who he is? - Who? - Shamugen, the inspector. - My goodness. - Shamugen? - The inspector? - Shamugen is your dad? - Shamugen is your dad? Since when did he become your dad? Since I was born. Dear, you are talking gibberish again. Such a small world. Let me give you some advice, Rani. Do you understand Hokkien? Yes, I can. I used to have a daughter called Ah Fang. Due to our selfishness and superstitious beliefs, I had to give Ah Fang away. The child is innocent. Don't go for an abortion. You will regret it in the future. We are adults. We can't be so selfish. Zhao Di, you are so right. We, as parents, think of ourselves in most situations. As a result, our kids become the victims. Just like my child, Ahmad. I thought of his guitar as a devil. I destroyed it. But actually, I destroyed our relationship. I broke his heart and forced him to go astray. He took drugs got caught by the police and is locked up now. Your dad is here to visit you. I don't want to see him, sir. - Are you sure? - Yes, sir. While in jail, he said, "Dad, I don't want to see you." I love him dearly. But he... Osman. Fatimah. Don't be sad. Someday, Ahmad will return to your side. Just the other day, I slapped Su Ting because her brother got beaten. She asked if she was my biological daughter. They are both my children. Why can't I dote on her like how I dote on Shun Fa? That's right. We faced the same problems. The elders are selfish to stop our marriage. Rani's stomach is getting bigger. What can we do? I don't know either. How do we face my parents? We all know your dad. I'm sure he cares about you. That time, when there were talks of riots, he went to every household to help us. We can see that he's very kind-hearted. He is very sincere. He promotes racial harmony. I know how to persuade him. Si Shu has always been superstitious. I know what to tell him. Rest assured. You must marry her, no matter what. Pregnant? What great news. For the wedding feast, are we going to get Chinese or Indian cuisine? Shark's fin or curry fish head for the guests? Things didn't start on the right track back then. Now that she is marrying in the family, more trouble will brew. Just keep quiet. The child is Ah Xi's. Ah Xi is a guy. He's not at a disadvantage. The child is a Lim. He is our grandchild. What is done cannot be undone. If they don't get married, our neighbors will ridicule us. They will point fingers and say that we're irresponsible. Si Shu. The Indian girl is a girl too. You'd have heard from the older generations that breaking a marriage would result in seven lifetimes of poverty. Do you remember back then you drew a bad lot from the Goddess Guanyin? You wanted me to give Ah Fang away for others to raise so that our home would be peaceful. I did as you said, and our life wasn't bad. Now that Ah Xi is marrying an Indian wife, I went to the same temple to pray for a lot. I couldn't believe it, so I prayed for another lot. Look. I actually got two of the best lots. - Two of the same ones? - Yes. I had goosebumps all over at that time. Si Shu, you have to listen to me. During Lunar New Year, you read the Almanac. It stated that a festive occasion is needed to counteract your bad luck for you to live to a ripe old age. Goddess Guanyin has arranged Ah Xi's marriage to help you. Yet you aren't willing? Aren't you scared? These are not from me but from Goddess Guanyin. Zhao Di didn't say this. These are words from Goddess Guanyin. What are you thinking about? You're always so stubborn. Father, the Goddess said this. We better not joke with it. Dad, it's an Indian daughter-in-law. You are looking at the Chinese Almanac, will it work? How about... going to Little India to buy an Indian version? - Dad, thank you. - Sir, thank you. Pregnant? - You raped my daughter? - No. Dad, it's not his fault. I'm in the wrong too. - I love him. - Shut up! You slept with this guy. Aren't you ashamed? - You're a disgrace to our family. - Dear, please be patient. Let's listen to what they have to say. Please sit down. You, shut up. Your work is in the kitchen. You don't open your mouth here. Understand? Rascal. You got my daughter pregnant because you wanted revenge? - No. - Because you want to embarrass me? Now, let me tell you something. I know many police officers at the station. Just a phone call and you'll go straight to prison. Shamugen, stop scolding them. Don't be so agitated. Ah Xi was in the wrong when he hurt you. I'm sorry. I apologize. The past is in the past. Now that Rani's pregnant and they're in love, please let them get married. No, not to this Chinese. You're being racist. No, I'm not a racist. I object to this marriage not because this gangster is Chinese. But because this Chinese man is a gangster. Even if this Chinese isn't a gangster, I cannot allow this marriage to go on because our culture is different, and the future will be difficult. Dad, we can learn about each other's culture. Yes, Father. Don't call me that. I will slap you. - Dad... - What? No, not "Dad." I mean... That's ridiculous. Don't blow things up. Why behave like this? Sit and discuss. Shamugen. You're right, but do you recall? When there were conflicts between the races, you came to our village to help us. After you came, we were relieved. You are an upright person. Despite having our stall confiscated, we were convinced. Just as you said, the most important thing is racial harmony. Let them get married. No, I cannot allow this marriage to go on. - Shamugen. - What? - Have you forgotten? - Forgot what? We, the citizens of Singapore, pledge ourselves as one united people... Regardless of race, language, or religion. Look. I got fooled by you. We'd discuss the marriage between Rani and Ah Xi. I'm the elder brother. I... - How do you say "represent" in English? - Represent... "Represent." I'm representing my parents at this meeting. Okay? I know that when Indians marry the bride's side will give the groom's side the dowry. Do you get dowry? - What is it in English? - Buttocks? - No. - What buttocks? - Even the buttocks are out. - How would I know? How did dowry become buttocks? I think it is "dowry." Yes, that's right. I mean "dowry." You give us the "dairy"? - We give you "dairy"? - Yes. That doesn't make sense. I'm so confused. What is this man talking about? What an idiot. We are giving our daughter to them, they should be the ones to give us dowry. Yes, what you are saying is correct. How about this? You speak. I listen. Now, I speak. You listen. My daughter's getting married to your brother. My daughter's getting married into your Chinese family. So we're going to follow and respect your Chinese customs. So you give us dowry and not the other way round. Right? - What is he saying? - What is he saying? Why are you nodding if you don't understand? He is saying since we are on the groom's side, they'll follow our customs. We'll be the ones giving them the dowry. No way! We can't do it that way. This is complicated. What did he mean? He wants to follow our customs. Of course, we're on the groom's side. They'll definitely have to follow our customs. No. If they follow our customs, we'll have to give them money. If we follow theirs, they'll have to give us money. - If that's the case, let's follow theirs. - That's of course. Okay, my father said to follow your customs. No. We'll follow your customs. No, we'll follow your customs. - No, according to your customs. - No, according to your customs. Everyone, wait. I will be the judge. Rani is getting married to Ah Xi. You must respect his custom. - So he'll pay to you. - Yes. Wise Osman. Good fellow. But Ah Xi is marrying Rani. He must respect your custom. You'll pay to him. That's right. You got a screw loose? Isn't that the same? - Yes. - That's right. Isn't it the same? Giving to each other. We are just respecting each other's customs. - Isn't that right? - Right. Ah Xi likes Rani. Rani likes Ah Xi. After marriage, you will all be a big family. That's right. Forget it. Isn't it the same to pass it around? She is bearing our Lim's family grandchild and is our future daughter-in-law. That is cause for celebration. What matters is that we are happy. As you wish. As long as you are happy. Yes. That's right. Be happy. - They're here. - They're here. Come on in. The one I love, the one I hold dear Where are you, just where are you? The one I love, the one I hold dear Where are you, just where are you? The past sweet times have transformed Into memories in my dreams The one I love, the one I hold dear Where are you, just where are you? The one I love, the one I hold dear Where are you, just where are you? I recall and I sigh Ah, I waited eagerly Ah, I am anxious Those joyous times aren't returning The one I love, just where are you? The one I love, the one I hold dear Where are you, just where are you? The one I love, the one I hold dear Where are you, just where are you? Even Zhao Tian Hao can't defeat me. - Draw the swords. - Si Ma Bu Ping. - Draw your sword. - Draw your sword. - Ou Yang Wu Di, draw your sword. - Draw your sword. - You draw first! - I'll let you draw it first! - You first! - I ask you to draw it first! - You draw! - You draw! It has been three months and he still hasn't drawn his sword. I'm so angry, I think I'll vomit blood. Dad, you really vomited blood? Mom, Dad watched Bodyguard and vomited blood. Dear, don't be so serious about dramas. That's right. Why are you coughing so badly? I'll take you to Singapore General Hospital tomorrow. Where is Ah Kun? He's sending a regular customer to the airport. Don't you need to work today? I applied for leave today. You can apply for leave. Ah Kun is self-employed. Why can't he take leave? He's afraid of offending his regulars. He's afraid of offending his regulars but not afraid of offending his dad? Don't say that. Isn't it the same if I brought you to the hospital? Looks like... I don't think I'll live to see the silly actors of Bodyguards draw their swords now. No. You'll see them draw their swords. You'll get to see them fighting, Si Shu. You'll live till a ripe old age. Don't worry. Zhao Di. I have a request. What is it? Can you stop calling me "Si Shu"? Call me "Dad." Haven't you always wanted me to address you as "Si Shu"? If I call you "Dad" there will be a clash of fortunes. I've already lived till this age. If it clashes, let it be. I always thought that sons would be filial. I didn't know that daughters would be more filial. Dad. Dad. Dad. Dad. Dad. Dad. Dad. Dad. I already said I can't call you "Dad." Dad. Zhao Di. I'm not dead yet. I'm just short of breath. Let me rest first. I will take you to the hospital now. You rest. Place the mourning cloths into the plate. Ah Xi. It's been two months since I gave birth and your father passed away. Would your family think I brought him bad luck? No. Humans just went to space. Who will care about all this? But will your family force me to give my baby away? - No, don't think too much. - Ah Xi. I know what she is saying. Tell her not to worry. We will not make her give away her child. Zhao Di, thank you. Ah Xi. Why are you thanking her? It's like this. Your daughter-in-law is worried as Dad passed away soon after she gave birth. She is worried you are superstitious too. No worries. Your dad is already in the coffin. His olden-day thinking was buried together with him. You gave birth to a boy. The boy is a Lim. You can't give him away. Is that so? All right. Let me tell you, luckily, he's a boy. There's no problem. What? I can't believe this. Both Indians and Chinese have this boy culture. Boy. Why? What's wrong with girls? There's nothing wrong. How do you say Birth Characters in English? Looks like you don't know. Birth Characters... Eight words, a clash means a clash. Forever clash. You can go to the moon, but it'll still clash. Look, she said her English was good. I spoke in English, and she couldn't understand. - I understand. - Stop talking nonsense. His joke is not funny. You keep quiet. I have something to tell Dad. Dad, after you left your thinking died with you too. I don't understand the youngster's thinking. Also, the plate number of your funeral car, I placed heavy bets on it. Please bless me that I'll win big. Once I win, I won't bother with how youngsters think. - Thank you. - Ah Kun. Don't gamble too much. Save the money. We siblings should pool our money to expand the pigsty. Dad. Before you died, I already said I won't raise pigs. After you left, some still insist I do. Please bless this person not to speak incoherently. So that I will have a peaceful life. Thank you. Ah Kun. Lim Ah Si's memorial tablet The year 1977 The southern breeze gently blows Brushing against the lush green grass In 1977, the government requisite several villages to build HDB apartments. Many were unwilling to leave their villages for a new life. People could shop and watch movies without going to town. There were many changes in their lives. Uncle Ah Xi and Aunt Rani did a joint application for their first place. So this is the HDB apartment? Looks like a pigeon cage. Not bad. It's built perfectly straight. It's not slanted. Some said that other places look like boxes of matches. Ah Kun, you're here. Was it difficult getting here? No. I drive the taxi around. There is no road I am unfamiliar with. You are lucky to get it after two years of application. I thought so too. That's right. You're lucky to get picked immediately. Some wait for three to five years. Three to five years for an apartment? A durian tree would have grown by then. - Which floor are you staying at? - Upstairs. Obviously. Can you stay downstairs? Fifth floor. Mom has weak legs. You're making her climb stairs? There is a lift over there. Lift? Mom, let's take the lift. - Let's go. - Okay. - There is a lift. - Not bad. Mom, look. The lift is right here. This is the lift? Yes. Press this button. The door will open on its own and we can walk in. How many people can it hold? Seven to eight shouldn't be a problem. - That's splendid. - Indeed. It's moving up. It's quite steady. The five of us are so heavy yet it can lift us. - The door's open. - Wait. Press the eighth floor. Let's try it again. This is our first time. It's so fun. Hurry. - Eighth floor? - Eighth floor. It can still bring us up. It's getting higher. Can you feel it? Do you feel that we are getting further from the ground? It shakes so much. - Won't we fall? - We won't. - Can we go to the fifth floor now? - Wait. Press the first floor. Let's ride it once more. Back to the first floor? It's our first time. We must make full use of it. First floor. Why do they call it taking the lift? There are no seats for us to take. We are all standing. There should at least be seats for us. It's shaking violently again. Will we drop? No, don't talk rubbish. Why don't you press the first floor again? That will be the fifth time. - The fifth time already? - Yes. With it going up and down non-stop, will it break? No, Zhao Di. Ah Xi, you need to take the lift so many times just to get to your place? No, Ah Kun was having fun with it. - I think that's enough. - All right, enough. Aunt and I already have a headache. - Fine. - I'll press the fifth floor then. Wait. You've been hogging the button. - Let me do it once. - You press it then. This is fun. Yes, we took so many trips on the lift. - Will the government charge us? - No, they won't. How can that be? The government charges us for everything but not for the lift? They're saying no to easy money? At least they have a conscience. Mom, this corridor is narrow and long. - Yes. - Which one is yours? There. Follow me. There. It's this high up? You can still grow crops. Yes, then we can plant some papayas, pandan leaves, and pomegranates. That's right. All your neighbors have locked their doors. - How do you get to know each other? - No idea. Once we moved in, it has been like this. - I've no idea why either. - Watch out. Locks. Locked metal gates. Behind the gate lies another wooden door. -If we were in a rush for the toilet, -Take a look. we'll still have to unlock the lock, the gate, and the door. By then, it'll be too late. The government should have a space for children to play. Or have some spiders for them to catch. We are here. Rani, Mom is here. Open the door. What's that on the floor? The water meter. It's proof for the government to collect money from them. They'll collect money for every single drop you use. What a shrewd government. I heard that every time you flush in your apartment, it costs ten cents. If you have more poop or it's denser, flushing twice is equivalent to flushing away a cheap meal. Does it cost that much just to use the toilet? So the three of you should plan beforehand to poop, then just flush the toilet once. Mom, how can we control our bowel movements? Just control it. You can do it. The village is better. Kerosene lamps were free. The well water was free. You're staying in an apartment, remember to save water. Do you understand? Yes, the television has been broadcasting it too. Don't waste water It has been so long. What's Rani doing? Rani, Mom is here. Faster. - Rani. - Coming. Sorry, I was feeding the baby. - Come in. - Come on in. - It's very neat. - So pretty. - Not bad. It looks quite nice. - It's so beautiful. - This is your room? - Yes. - This is your kid's? - Yes. - The kid is sleeping. - Sorry. Not bad. They used cement and bricks. Very sturdy. But only two steps, and you are against the wall. Two more steps, another wall. From what I see, this entire house is smaller than our kitchen. You can't compare this way, Mom. Our kitchen will catch fire. But not here, you see. The roof won't leak either. This is the fifth floor. Even if it leaks, it will start with the tenth floor, right? That's true. Staying here is good. If it rains, the roof won't leak. If it floods, it won't reach us. If it reaches us, then Singapore's doomed. That's true. - Is that the kitchen? - Yes. - I'll show it to you. - Let's go and see. Soon after Uncle Ah Xi's move to the HDB apartment, Mr. Osman moved too. The villages in Singapore started disappearing. After they moved, he invited us to visit his new house. Have we reached it yet? We've been searching for a while. This is the one. This one? There is a papaya tree. Osman is quite a character. Ah Xi, you need to do better. Plant a durian or rambutan tree to outdo him. - Osman. - Osman. Osman. They are here. Welcome. Come in. It's been a while. - Have some pastries. - Thank you. Fatimah made all this. Which is better, the apartment or the village? There are good and bad. The good thing is I can use the toilet at home. In the village, I'd walk outside to use the toilet. I might even meet a ghost at night. What about the cons, Osman? The con would be that all the doors are shut tight. We don't know each other. It's different from the village. We've been here a whole year, yet we remain strangers. Yes, it's the same for me. How much were you compensated? Not much. My house was rented. I was only given a few thousand dollars. A few thousand? You are rich. It's fine. Zhao Di is different. She has a farm and a farming permit. The compensation should be good. I have a friend who had a farm and a farming permit. He was compensated 11,800 dollars. A farming permit gets you 11,800 dollars? Yes, 11,800 dollars. Since Ah Xi is back and we're all here, I have something to discuss with everybody. I heard from Osman. His house was huge, yet he only received 3,000 dollars. The government is really mean. If we got the same amount and divide it by four. One person will only get a few hundred. We are in trouble then. You're planning to divide the money by four? Of course. Although Zhao Di is considered an outsider, she has stayed for so many years, one portion should be hers, right? Everyone, let's eat. What are you waiting for? Zhao Di. You like to eat the wings, this is for you. Ah Kun, thank you. What are you saying? We're a family. No need to thank me. Let's eat. Osman also said that a farming permit gets you 11,800 dollars. When we divide it by four, how much would that be? Why is it divided by four? I'm already so generous with the house's profits. Zhao Di should share her farming permit's profits too. It doesn't make sense. For so many years, she has been working hard, raising chickens, ducks, and pigs. Those are her hard-earned money. We have no right to share it with her. Why not? The house and permit belong to Dad. We are his children. What's wrong with sharing? Back then, you were the first one Dad asked, and you rejected it. Dad asked you so many times, but you got mad. Have you forgotten? It has been so many years and Zhao Di had it tough. Transforming that barren land until she could rear animals on it. You didn't do anything, yet you have the cheek to ask for the profits? How dare you? Just because you can support yourself now, you're starting to speak disrespectfully. Haven't you heard? Eldest brother as a dad figure. The eldest son is just like the dad. Just do as you are told. Why are you questioning so much? Ah Kun, Ah Xi is just putting in a fair word. My word is final, not yours. Don't talk mumbo jumbo to me. Ah Kun. It's forgivable if you don't understand what Rani said. But you're Chinese, and we don't understand what you're saying. Ah Kun, I understand your language. But I can't understand you. When Dad asked me, I said I'll consider. I didn't say I didn't want it. I have yet to make up my mind and she took it. - Is that fair to me? - You considered it for so many years. The policemen have even changed their shorts to pants. Dear, Zhao Di has put in so much effort all these years. If it's not ours, we shouldn't ask for it. You shut up! Everyone is against me, and you stand with them? Are you full of crap or are your brains crap? Mom. Dad has passed away. You're the head of the family. You be the judge. Let me put in a fair word. If we were to follow our customs from Tang Shan, should the Dad pass, the son would inherit it all. Grandma, why are you so biased? I am biased? I treat all my children equally. What are you saying? Don't act like a know-it-all. How do you teach your kids? Don't think I dare not hit you because your mom is here. Su Ting. Behave yourself. Sit. Ah Kun. When Si Shu was around, the farming permit was for you or Ah Xi to inherit. But the two of you rejected it. He then passed it to me, his daughter. I raised the animals, not for the compensation. I only wanted to feed my family. Now that I am old, with no CPF or money. My children are still young. When the government comes to evict us, how will I have the means to get a house? Please tell me. Where do you want my family and me to move to? Zhao Di, listen to me. Don't be afraid of him. It's your name on the farming permit. The cheque from the government will have your name on it. Even if you don't give it to him, he can't do anything. No worries. Wonderful. Using the government to pressurize me. You kids, look at your mom. She's trying to pocket my money. You want to play games? Bring it on. It's fine. Eat. Aunt, eat. Eat. Zhao Di. - Ah Long? It has been so long. - Yes. I've been selling durians in Malaysia these days. So I'm seldom here. The driver is sick today, so I helped with the delivery. This is good. Here's a variety of durians for you. Thank you. What's up? No. Nothing. Something's wrong with you. I can tell. Let me know. I'll stand up for you. I'll make sure to teach that person. Are you still not afraid? No, I'm just kidding. Prison isn't for humans. Are you really fine? Yes. What could be the matter? It's good then. Zhao Di, I have three tickets here. Qingshan and Yao Surong's performance tickets. I want to invite you and Su Ting to watch it. Tomorrow night at 7:00 p.m. I'll pick you up. We've never been to such performances. So you should go experience it. I don't know if I'm free tomorrow. It doesn't matter. Tomorrow night at 7:00 p.m. I'll pick you up. Let's go together. After hearing my story, you should understand. I am the Lim family's eldest son. There's no reason I don't have a share. I'm a woman with four children. - I only have this... - She always says this. Making herself out to be so pitiable. Everyone, please be the judge. I'm not after her compensation money. I am afraid Zhao Di will take the compensation money for the farm and give it to her lover and do the Lim Family wrong. Zhao Di was chased out and forced to move back. I also don't know why suddenly she's like a sow during the mating season. She's always meeting that gangster, Ah Long, secretly. I bet her late husband knew of their affair and got so infuriated that he died. That's why she got chased out by the first wife. How can you say that I am coquettish? You're making such malicious accusations. Because of money, you slander me. These are not baseless accusations. Ah Long is always with you at the pigsty. Giggling and exchanging glances. Who knows what you're up to? Dear, don't talk rubbish. You shouldn't do this. She's your sister. I'm not lying. I saw it with my own eyes. Uncle. When he came to look for Mom, I was there too. How can you spew such nonsense? You think your mom is a Saint? She's always hitting and scolding you. She doesn't treat you like her own. She's worse than a stepmom, yet you're speaking up for her? No matter what she does to me, she's still my mom. What she does is for our own good. For us, she listened to you people and gave our sister away. Do you know how much it hurts us? - Don't go on. - No, Mom! - Enough. - I must say this! Yes. My mom often hits me. Because of that, I learned how to be a better person. Look at you. Being pampered since you were young. When you're in the wrong, Grandpa and Grandma didn't dare to and couldn't bear to hit you. Do you all know? At home, I clean my brother's mess after he uses the toilet. But every time Uncle gets into trouble, it's my mom who cleans up his mess. Little rascal. I'll kill you! - I'm Ah Long. - That is him. He is my sister's lover. Mind your words. What lover? I am Ah Kun's archenemy. What you told everyone... I overheard it from outside. Luckily, I'm here. So let's get things straight. I got to know Zhao Di as I was collecting protection fees from her then. I admire this woman. I was such a ruthless gangster, yet she wasn't fearful of me. To protect her younger brother, she put her life on the line. Even though she was battered with injuries, - she didn't even frown. - That's right. That day, if it wasn't for Zhao Di, I would have been beaten to death. Also, to prevent us from chopping up his legs, she didn't even hesitate... Look! She gave her own earrings to pay off your debts. Ah Kun, ask yourself. Where are you going to find such a good sister? I've kept this pair of earrings for so long. Because I was really touched by this incident. Now, I'll turn this pair of earrings to you. Mom, you saw that? Keeping the earrings for so long, who'd believe there's nothing between them? This is what we call an adulterous pair. Aunt. You talk rubbish every day, and I just let it go. But she's your biological sister. How can you say that about her? For money, you'll slander her. Are you human? I will kill you. - Mom. - Aunt, don't. Ah Kun. For the farming permit compensation, you'll stoop to anything. You're worse than a monster. Me? A monster? You're a brute. This is my family's problem. Stop bothering us. Get lost. Ah Kun, you want to talk about family matters? When Dad was dying, where were you? I wasn't free. You weren't free? You're brushing it off with just one sentence? You're not busy. You're just unfilial. - You! - Dear. Ah Kun! Be reasonable. Don't hanker after others' fortune. Your sister has done plenty for you, yet you are biting the hand that feeds you? What are you saying? Yes. Everyone's talking to you in Hokkien, and you can't seem to understand. So I'll speak Tamil and maybe you'll understand. You... Very well. The whole family against me? I'll remember this. Ah Kun, let me say something fair. If it doesn't belong to you, it's not yours. Don't play dirty. Ah Kun, your sister has worked so hard on the farm. There's no reason for her to split the money. I asked you here to judge, not to lecture me. You can all scram! Dear, where are you going? To get out of here! Dear, where are you going? Don't go, it's late. It's dangerous. Don't go. Come back. Stop the car. Dear, where are you going? Dear! Over here. Aunt, they're here to visit Ah Kun. Thank you. - Mrs. Lim. - Thank you. - Dad. - He is awake. - Ah Kun. - Dad. - Dad. - As long as you are awake, it's okay. - Retribution. - Don't talk rubbish. Yes, don't speak nonsense. Dear, it's all right now. Don't talk. Rest well. Where's my taxi? - Taxi... - What happened to my taxi? No worries. You need to discard the old to gain something new. Yes. What's important is you're fine. This is a mishap. To escape death, you'll have good fortune afterward. Goddess Guanyin must be looking after you. When you're well, let's thank her in the temple. The injuries... For full recovery, it'd take at least six months. Six months? No work for six months. How are we to survive? Don't worry, everyone. Look. I have a lottery ticket here. If I win, everything will be solved. You bought the lottery? You want to depend on it? No, it's just for fun. I know my limits. Ah Feng. I heard rumors that for resettlement, the compensation is good. You don't need to worry. You can use it to tide over first. - No problem. - Yes, I've heard of that too. - That's right. It's a hefty compensation. - Don't worry. You don't have to be so frustrated. Thank you. Ah Xi. I find you Chinese very funny. Before the government has surveyed your property, you're already talking about compensation as though it's guaranteed. Why listen to what others say? What about the Indians then? Dad, Indians are also the same. You also listen to what others say. Indians like that, Chinese like this. We Malays also believe in hearsay. - We're all the same. - Exactly. Father, based on your experience, do you know when they will survey our house? Maybe in the next two to three months? Let me remind you. The government may not give us any compensation if you do not meet their requirements. They may not give us compensation? Scary, right? - Who said that? - The government. How do they determine our compensation? They didn't talk about this. They won't and they can't. Shamugen. You work there and have a wide social circle. Teach us how to get a higher amount of compensation. Are there any tricks? I cannot say this. Hey, let me knock on your heart And ask if this feeling is true More than sweet nothings I'd rather have your true feelings Hey, let me get close to your heart Hear the answer the heart plays Don't want to hear anything else Just wanted to know if there is any warmth I pray that there is warmth in the world Human warmth is great It even allows a withered tree to bud And the frost to melt Warmth is noble Hey, let me get close to your heart Hear the answer the heart plays Don't want to hear anything else Just wanted to know if there is any warmth Hey, let me lie by your side quietly Hear you talk about your hopes I want to cherish this feeling Letting you know how warm the heart is I pray that there is warmth in the world Human warmth is noble It allows a withered tree to bud And even the frost to melt Zhao Di, is the assessment over? The compensation shouldn't be too measly. I'm heading out to sea. Take care. You be careful too. Ah Long. Thank you. Welcome. Mom, a letter from the government. The government's letter? - Rani, help me read it. - Let me see. Put it here. Good news. Ah Xi, look! The government is giving us the compensation. Compensation? How much? The house, the trees, and the others, a total of 6,000 dollars. Zhao Di, your farming permit is 11,800 dollars. That's a total of 17,800 dollars. The government is giving us 17,800 dollars. Isn't it strange? I wonder how they got these figures. How about I get my wife to write a letter to ask why we got this amount? No need. Are you asking for trouble? Yes, never trouble a trouble till the trouble troubles you. What if we end up without a single penny? We'll all have to stay in the pigsty. That's true. The deities blessed us with this cash. So don't go and ask. Right, we're able to get so much because of Zhao Di. No, that's not true. This money belongs to all of us. We worked hard to earn it. I decided to split it into four. Ah Kun, Ah Xi, Aunt, and I. We each get a share. I don't need it. I'm so old. If you really want to split it, give it to my eldest grandchild. The eldest grandchild is like a younger son. So it's my share? I'm the eldest grandchild. You are the eldest grandchild, not the eldest grandson. My grandson is Ah Hai. The grandson is here. Sorry, I just got back from school. What kept you so late? You couldn't catch the bus? Let's eat. Mom, Zhao Di has worked so hard. If you want to, give it to Shun Fa. - What about us? - What about us? You guys? You don't have a share. Go and eat. Mom, don't say that. Don't be too calculative with family. What was that saying... "We are a family." Right? What? Did I say something wrong? Or am I too handsome today? Yes, our family are all humans. It's "We are a family." - Eat. - Our fortune. Our fortune. Thank you for blessing us. For bestowing us the grant to move into the apartment. We now have a shelter and don't need to worry. We are all thankful. Our last two firecrackers. After we move, there'll be no more firecrackers. Let's go big. - Let's prosper. - Let's prosper. Zhao Di. Sorry, I am late. Come over, quick. Hurry. Osman, so many satays. How much are all these? This is my new business. I opened a new stall at Satay Club. Satay Club? On Connaught Drive? - Yes. - That's great. Yes. These satays are from me. From you? It's my treat. You're treating us? How will that do? Why not? Let's eat satay. My treat. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Hurry. Come. Those who want satay come over. It's freshly made. - Let me know if you need a drink. - Okay. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Eat. - This is delicious. - Thank you. - This drink is tasty. Mom, eat more. Ah Kun. Get Osman to eat. You take over. - Osman. - What? - Go eat. - It's okay, you eat. - You eat, I'll take over. - Go. - Thank you so much. Come. - Go now. - Let's go. I am hungry too. - Okay. - Osman, hurry. - I'm starving. I'm starving. Let's eat. Let's eat nasi lemak. Zhao Di, I'll only eat Fatimah's nasi lemak. After Ahmad left, it has been so long since I ate it. Dear, do try some. Try it. It's special. Okay. This taste... Did you make this? No. Who did then? Who? Look, see who's here. I made it. Whatever you have taught me, I kept in mind. Mom. Dad. Ahmad. When you were born into this world Your mom and dad saw a dream fulfilled A dream come true The answer to their prayers You were to them a special child Gave them joy every time you smiled Each time you cried They're at your side to care Child, you don't know You'll never know how far they'd go To give you all their love can give To see you through, and God it's true They'd die for you if they must To see you live - Zhao Di. - Mom. Miss, Lim Zhao Di. Zhao Di. We're here to see you. Zhao Di, why didn't you tell us you were so ill? It doesn't matter. This is predestined. Zhao Di. I don't want this money any more. Use it to get a doctor. No need. There's no cure for cancer. You keep the money well. You don't have any CPF just like me. When you move to the apartment in the future, you'll need it. Don't use it to gamble. Take care of Ah Feng and the kids, okay? Where's Su Ting? I'm here, Mom. Su Ting. Since you were young, I have been unfair to you. I forced you to take care of your siblings. I always beat and scold you. I know you're very obedient. You're a great sister. I'm scared that I won't have a chance to repay you. Don't blame me. Mom. I know you love us. I'm not unhappy. You will have a healthy and long life. You will live until 100. I don't need to live that long. I'm so happy today. Seeing my family united as one. I'm so touched. You'll be moving into the apartment after this. A place to shelter you from the weather. No need to fear fire hazards, floods, or leaking roofs that need mending. Mom. Don't worry. I'm the eldest daughter just like you. I'll take care of my siblings. Be rest assured. Out of us all, I'm the most useless. I went to the temple earlier to pray to the Goddess Guanyin. I prayed for you to live to 120. From today onwards, I will be a strict vegetarian. The Goddess Guanyin will bless you. Zhao Di, don't worry. Your sickness will be cured. That's right, Zhao Di. Doctors these days are brilliant. They'll have a way to save you. I'm already so old. You must be healthier than me. Mom, you will get well. I'll sing a song for you now. -Only Mom is the best in the world -Only Mom is the best in the world -Those with a mom are like treasures -Those with a mom are like treasures -Diving into Mom's hug -Diving into Mom's hug -There will be endless happiness -There will be endless happiness Xinchengji Xinchengji Uncle, can I hold this? Of course. Tell your mom to go to the apartment to stay with you guys. Now that Mom is gone, we realized that before she left, she had everything already arranged for us. We really miss her. At the same time, we can't bear to part with the house we grew up in and our village. Let me sing a song A very old song I will sing it softly And you harmonizing Do you still remember The past dream That was filled with hope The splendid days When we endure hardships For our ideals We cried And laughed together If only you would remember For a long time to come The glistening days We experienced it together When we endure hardships For our ideals We cried And laughed together If only you would remember For a long time to come The glistening days We experienced it together The glistening days We experienced it together We finally moved to the HDB apartment. Mom worked hard her whole life so that we can have a house to shelter us and have nothing to worry about. When we wanted to repay her for all her contributions, it was all too late. Some of our blessings are the silent sacrifices of others. Apart from being grateful, please treasure them. The founding of a nation is always precipitated by an age of promise. Our age of promise is "the move." The move, not just resettling from villages to apartments. The creation of a brave new world improved the quality of life. The rise of a new economy along with the eradication of the underworld. Because with "the move," settlements clustered by races become history. We become one. And together, we write our story.
