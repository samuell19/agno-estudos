In the late 1980s and early '90s, a new world order is established. As the Berlin Wall and Soviet Union fall, so does Cuba, into a dark abyss without sufficient gas or food, also known as the "Special Period". Havana, August 4, 1994. The North Coast sea conditions will go from calm to light winds and swells, potentially dangerous for small vessels. A mostly sunny day with isolated showers during the night. At 4 pm, a power outage is scheduled for El Cerro, Central Havana and Vedado. Give me a G minor. OK, are we ready? Hey! Look who's coming. Candela! We're waiting to rehearse. I wrote you a song. Listen up! Candela, my life, I been waiting for you, honey You leaving already? Listen to the rest. Pretty Candela... Isn't your husband coming today? You play this note... Candela, my life, Candela, come Candela, The one who lifts my heart... OK, are we ready? In my garden lie sleeping the white lilies, spikenards and roses. My soul, so sad and regretful, seeks to hide from the flowers its bitter pain. In my garden lie sleeping the white lilies, spikenards and roses. My soul, so sad and regretful, seeks to hide from the flowers its bitter pain. I don't want the flowers to know how life tortures me so. If they knew how I'm suffering they would add their tears to my pains Silence! The spikenards and the lilies lie sleeping. I don't want them to know how life tortures me so. For, if they saw my teary eyes, they would surely die. For, if they saw my teary eyes, they would surely die. My little chicks got all wet. What are you doing with my books? Instead of drying up puddles, you should have moved my chicks. Instead of leaving the door open, you should have closed it. You like that, right, Dos Gardenias? Sleepy, sleepy, close your eyes, you're so sleepy, just close your eyes... the special situation we are living amidst great economic hardships. The embargo... I'm coming! Is a fact I have a game on Friday. But it has never been a just concept. Which shoes do you plan to wear? With mine. They're mine, right? Despite our great poverty... to which... How did it go at the bar? Few tourists. Basilio sends his regards. As usual. Not one child without a school... or a teacher... I'll go. Take the light bulb. It's the only one left. And unplug the radio. Should we play until the light comes back? One day it'll come right down on our heads. And they'll write about it in the 'Granma': "Two malnourished seniors not killed by hunger, but crushed by a busted lamp." Good night, Candelaria. Good night, Victor Hugo. Victor Hugo. Your pants are ready. The day you eat your carrot, they won't fall. Hide them. The day the guard from CDR finds out, you'll regret it. They're so little. Eating them would be a waste. If you lose more weight than usual, - it's a sign that - How do we not lose weight if we're on a forced diet? Let's do this: When the results are out, come back to my office. Just a sec. Listen, the game is on the 6th, so be ready. LAW ON THE TRIBUTARY SYSTEM PASSED Come on. I'll give you a discount for this one. Candelita, have a look, that dress of yours won't take another patch. Hey, Fatty, are you so desperate you're selling your grandma's clothes now? Look who's talking! Oh, how gross. Know what I'm saying? All night long. She's bad... Scoring 4 runs in the ninth inning, Industriales beats Isla De la Juventud 8 to 5. Villa Clara went into overtime with Santiago De Cuba, ending in a tie. We've got to get out of here. Candelaria leave that, the streets are on fire... What's going on? Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Let's go now, here we go! Gotcha! Careful with that pitcher, he really got you! And you take care of that nasty cough of yours. Gather round, everyone! Return to your jobs. Return to your jobs. There was a riot in Havana. The game is suspended. Because it's suspended! It's for your own good. Come on... Silencio, daddy's coming. Say yes, pio pio so he won't eat you. I'm beat. I played but I didn't suffocate. They cancelled the game. The people took to the streets. It came out of nowhere at work. Just like that? Yes. Among a pile of dirty sheets in the basement. Take it back. We can sell it. Give it back to your boss. He would sell it too. Whatever. It's none of your business. So you can sell your tobacco but I can't do this. Take it back. And stop using my books for the chicks. Soon we'll be using them to wipe our asses. If you're hungry, the only thing we have is carrot cake. Some say we can have the embargo lifted... if we give up our political principles, if we give up socialism... - Hello!? - Come in... Be careful... Don't step on the chicks. - You have chickens? - Yes. Well, then I'll sue you for keeping, feeding, and rearing these minors against all Cuban food laws! Where's your wife? In the bathroom. Have a seat. Give me a minute. Hey you! Get fat fast and I'll have a little surprise for you. Business, business. Yes, sir. Here. It would be a little sad to eat those chicks... Candelaria wouldn't allow it. Would she notice one missing? That one for example is called Bayamesa. If one's missing, she'll notice immediately. Then how about "Guantanamera" instead? Hey, give me that! Show some respect... OK, OK... Hey, I like this... Should I take it to the carpenter for you? Who's that? The best known guy in Havana. Fences stuff, you know. No, but Candelaria didn't steal that. She found it at work. I already told her to take it back. You can sell your stolen cigars but she can't? Don't be such a jerk. C'mon, I want a statement! Do you plead guilty or not guilty? Speak to the camera... Hey Victor! You'd better cooperate... Let's see what's on this tape. Hold on... This goes here. Then... "play". Have a look... Look, someone's on it. Look this way, c'mon... Come on... Is El Negro gone already? Yes. How much did he pay you? Did he bring the chalk? What do we do? How can something like this happen in this hotel? How many maids had access to the room? We chose you because Cuba is a safe place to come for vacation. This can't happen. It's not just the theft, the footage is personal... Yeah, I know. So what are you going to do about it? We'll conduct an investigation. And we'll see what we get... A few days ago, a camera went missing. Are you saying we're thieves? You'll all be questioned. Everybody out, I don't have all day. Alright. Let's go, then... Alright. Bring it on! The rooms on the seventh are made between 11 am and noon. That's your shift in the basement. Is that so? The floor maids know nothing. But one... said the camera could have been tangled in the sheets. If that's the case, you must have seen it. Yes. I was at the protest. What were you doing there, Candelaria? Every employee who went has been suspended. No, no. I didn't take part in it. I was just curious. Well, "curiosity killed the cat". How long were you there? Half an hour maybe. Don't know... But when I came back, the laundry duct was empty. Victor Hugo, pass me the bright light. I have to melt this soap. There we go... I don't really know what I'm doing here, but... See? Look at my babies... Come here, kiddies, so daddy can see you... So cute! Where are the others? Do you like it? I liked the other one better. I don't quite get the concept of this one. Too artsy. Eat. No playing with that thing at the table! You'll break it and how are we going to give it back then? Eh? You're a very good actress. But you need a good director for guidance... Candelaria, how many times have I told you? You must keep your diet! Zero calories, zero meat, except for those chicks, of course. When those chicks grow up they'll be eaten anyway. I'm so sorry. It's just that, when was the last time you kissed me? You scared the shit out of me. Don't scratch, it'll only make it worse. Take a look. See anything? Hey! See what I mean? Let's go stand in line. Let's see the backpack... Keep it on. - OK. See you tomorrow. - See you. Victor Hugo... What's in that backpack? The newspapers. - Newspapers? - Yep. Let's have a look. What's going on? Why are you searching everyone? I told you to open it. Fine. You alright? Sure. Take that nasty cough to the doctor, will you? Go on, leave. Excuse me, sorry... Don't forget to see the doctor! Sometimes I want to fly like the wind. I feel that oh so cynical, indifferent youth fading away... The years come, sobbing with time And this body of mine acted its role of freedom, believing in ideas, and love, holding on to impossible dreams for but a smile... But today, it's tired... weak, sluggish, almost lifeless... In the midst of a society that applauded me, that played me, fooled me, and abandoned me to solitude... Maybe it's better this way. The soul can learn to laugh when it has accepted death. - Where were you? - I went to see you at the bar. I saw the looks Basilio and you exchanged. When you left, I confronted him. That's a lie. If you had, I would have seen you. There was nobody there. What happened to you? I fell off the bike. And the bike? It's outside. But it's not working. I goofed up. - Let me take care of those wounds. - Alright. Whoa, hold on... Don't... Just that. What are you doing? When did I stop looking at you? Wait a sec. Wait, wait. I'll take it off myself. I'll do it myself. The zipper gets stuck. No, no. Wait! Let me take it off. I'll do it, I'll do it. Wait... There, almost off... Better than nothing, eh? I'm fine, thanks... How are you? What happened to you? I had to teach one of Candelaria's suitors a lesson. What? I fell off my bike. You're just like this building. And this building is like the whole country. No one can fix it. But no one can bring it down either, though. Stop riding that bike, you're too old. You should rather buy my machine. Come with me. Come in, on you go... This product has been crafted by my studies and knowledge. It's nothing less than a miracle. Your eyes will pop out. And those of the whole world... Give it a minute. All it needs is, here... Once it's fixed, they're going to rip it out of my hands. The problem of Cuban ball players in the major league is the lack of meat. They should eat nothing but meat for two years before hitting their first ball. That's the problem. Shit, if there was no African blood in our veins, this island would be deserted. This way... It's a mess. Kids are getting smaller, not bigger... Reproductive functions are decreasing. It's bad, brother. Listen... What are they selling? PPG of course. What's it to you? Don't tell me you and Candelaria... Don't give me that look. It's good news. If I'm still doing it at your age, I'll be a national hero! Listen up. Be careful with that, OK? Because if the hard-on doesn't go away, we'll have to bury you upside down. Welcome to The Ant House. Better known as the Carpenter's Cave. You've got to go in alone. Just go, man. No worries. It's a done deal. I don't smoke. You should. You look tense. Nervous? If it's not back by the morning, it'll look like you stole it. Got it? What can I do for you? Oh, these times of crisis... Before the Wall came down, business was better. You could never have come by just to sell me a watch. Here... real business was done. Shall we go outside? How much do you want? It's old, but works perfectly. A treasure, indeed... Expensive, but only in hypothesis. And that's the only advantage of times of crisis. I'd say today this jewel is worth... ten dollars exactly. Or fifty. Ten, that's all. To die of nostalgia... or to die of hunger... Candelaria! Cande! Look who's here! Cande! What are you doing there? Where did you get that dress? And where did you get that bike? Come on, I'll take you. What did you do? Can't a man surprise his beautiful wife? Beautiful indeed. But surprises... on this island? Let's go. Or I'll eat yours too! Like that? From the bottle? Should I get a glass? Bon appetit, Negro. Bon appetit. It's cold... Took you too long! You're the only one in Cuba to complain with a piece of pork in the mouth. The only one. Dear Sir, I'm deeply grateful for this invitation to this restaurant of supreme elegance... You shouldn't have bothered. What I did for you, I'd have done for anybody. When I heard the screams, and I saw you trapped under the gigantic lamp, that useless thing, I had no choice but to rescue you, sir. But my lady, before you rescued me from under that lamp, you took all your clothes off. Why on Earth did you do that, my lady? Do you always do that with men in distress? It's just... I was afraid my dress would get all tangled up in the tears the gigantic lamp was shedding... You know how difficult it is to find a dress in this city. By the way... That dress you're wearing does look spectacular on you. Although I'd rather see you with no clothes at all. Like on that unforgettable day. If you like I'll take it off. I love eating naked. Do quite as you please, my lady. For this dinner is in your honor... Sir, will leave me naked while you are quite dressed? What will our other guests say about such ungentlemanly-like behavior? Where's your watch? I had to sell it, ma'am, to invite you to a place like this. And I don't regret it one bit. You won't go selling off all our clothes, will you? I should have! Why save things if we might be dead tomorrow? You're so right sir. You must excuse my silliness... Remember it was me who saved your life. Victor Hugo! Wake up! Hurry! It's late! One of your chicks. One of her chicks. Which one are you? Dos Gardenias? Two jasmines for you... Coming. Coming. CDR neighborhood watch. Some chicks are missing and we know you have them. Hey, Victor Hugo, open the door. It's me. - Come in. - Didn't you like the joke? It's funny! Hey! You didn't sell the camera... This is the last time I sell you cigars. They're on to us. I'm done with the engines, they're in pretty good shape. I'm taking the Caibarien route. It's closest to Callegueso. Nooo... Poor thing. And you? When are you leaving? When my brother gets back. Someone has to stay and take care of my mother. That can take weeks. Well, that gives me time... to say goodbye to Isabelita, Claudita... Lucia... Ingrid, Dani, Sandra... Don't I know it... Hold on. I want to give you something. This is a compass that never fails. It was my dad's. It's the same brand as the watch. Manuel. El Negro. Nooo... Strike one. Strike three. - Two. - Two. Strike out! Silencio isn't here. It seems like he got out. All because we removed your damn books. They're useless anyway. You still have four others. You killed him, didn't you? He must be around here somewhere. I'll look for him. But stop crying. It's just a chick, not a baby. Get out. Go sleep in the living room. I knew I'd see you again. Last time, I didn't ask your name. Victor Hugo. And what can I do for you today, Victor Hugo? All stolen goods end up here, right? Not all. Just the best quality. These breasts have never given milk. But that's not why they're perfect. But because they're an older woman's. It's been years since I've seen a treasure like what you brought me. I didn't bring you anything. You two are the perfect couple. What you need now are stage names. Although Victor Hugo is just perfect. Tell me one thing. Before stealing this camera, did you have sex with your wife? Just what I thought. We didn't steal it. And I don't want to steal your tapes either. That's why I'm going to pay you. I assure you. That we're gonna sell them at an excellent price. If there's one good thing about this crisis, it's the tourists and their strange tastes. I'll ask my wife. But I doubt she'll agree. You won't regret doing business with me. Candelaria... Forgive me for saying it was just chick. I know you loved it. We're going to find it. Silencio is not here. I'm sure he escaped. And if someone finds him, he'll be eaten. And what was it we had it for? Food again? Where do you get it from? I have to tell you something. Me too. They fired me. Because of the camera? No. That fatty accused me of stealing the dress. Are you under investigation? No. I gave it back and that was it. What were you going to tell me? Yesterday someone stole the camera from me. Today I went to get it back. A guy called The Carpenter had it. Same guy I sold the watch to. He liked our video. And he wants more. What for? To sell them. He says the tourists like strange stuff. I'm a decent woman, Negro. Come on, help me get all this back into shape... You're soaked... The power's been out since the afternoon. Where were you? Taking a walk. The videos were good. You said you were a decent woman. Yes, I know. What made you change your mind? Don't you mind if people see it? And if we get caught? And if the CDR inspector finds it? I don't think he's interested in sex by old people. Are you sure? No. I didn't know I could spread my legs like that. It's been so long! What if I don't get a hard-on? Don't you dare get soft on me... If you do this, it's for people to see you. No sheets. It's still an intimate moment. The first video was better. You need to relax. Forget you're on camera. You can go now. And the money? This video is useless. You asked for a video of me and my wife having sex and there it is. If we do business together, it's better we're friends. If we do business, it's better you don't rip me off. We've already sold some copies of the first video. We'll be famous in Havana within a few weeks. Let's say... These are royalties. So you can see I'm a man you can trust. Bring me a good porn movie. A real one. And it's payday for you every week. We are the only country in the world with so many doctors per capita. The embargo will never change that. But you won't let me sing at El Frente... With this revolution, started more than 35 years... they are trying to sell our country... And these crazies say everyone must do as they do... We cannot end the embargo as a political trade-off. It is a question of national sovereignty. We'll rather lose, than give that up. Cande! So? And we now ask Victor Hugo to sing with us... I want to sing with you! OK now... Let's sing together, Victor Hugo and Candelaria. I swear that I almost can't sleep... My life is an endless torture. I comfort myself by watching your portrait. I go back to sleep and I wake up again. I leave the bed and I look out the window, I gaze out the night, it's splendor, and let myself be surprised by the morning light, in my crazy wakefulness for your love. Wonderful. Big round of applause, everyone! What's wrong, Negro? Are you worried? You'll see how the results will come out just fine. We've been eating better, and have been happier... Come on. Give me a smile. The cancer has spread. I suggest we operate. And then chemotherapy. And when would you operate? What are the chances the chemo works? Depends on how the operation goes. But give me a percentage! Who is it? What's wrong with you? When are you leaving? Are you that sad? I promise as soon as I get to the stadium, I'll send a picture. What's wrong man? And now? Don't you worry. I've heard that kind of treatment can really cure the disease. Sometimes, maybe. But sometimes they just take the little happiness you have left. You could also die. Everyday rafters drown or are eaten by sharks. You've seen that engine of mine. Mine is no raft. It's a torpedo! Candelaria always wanted kids. And now, all that'll be left are those chicks. It's better this way. If we'd had children, we would be starving to death, or risking our lives to make it to Florida, like you. Don't say that, Victor Hugo. With children, it might have been different altogether. You saw it, the boys from El Malecon are the ones taking home the money. Who would've thought it's not hunger we would die from. No matter how much I want to blame it on this damn island! Hey, honey, don't act so lost! I'm right here. Come on up. Come on. How do you know where I live? Since the day I bought the watch from you I've known where you live. What can I do for you? You never came back. I was beginning to worry. So I wanted to make sure everything's okay. Yes. Everything's okay. OK. Can I come in? No. My wife is on her way. I don't want her to meet you. But I already know her. You might have to find a new couple. Your movie was selling very well. A partner of mine wants to sell it abroad. I advise you not to cut me off like that. Hold the door. Good afternoon. Candelaria. What a pleasure... Oh! You are the business man. Nice to meet you. The pleasure is all mine. And what can we do for you? I'm here to make you an offer. I want to pay you in advance and double the price for the next videos. Who would've thought? Now that we're old, we're getting famous. Thank you. We've decided not to share our intimacy with the world anymore. May I ask why? No Cuban in his right mind would reject this offer. We're an old couple and we're tired. Can you understand that? You still owe me the video I paid in advance. Thank you. Have a good day. And don't ever come back. We won't change our mind. Is he gone? He'll leave. Did you see how much he was offering? With that money we wouldn't have trouble paying for the treatment. Negro, I'm not undergoing the treatment. Why put myself through all of it if we can be just fine. We might starve to death on this island. The lamp could crush us tonight. If we tried to escape, our raft could capsize. Cuba is under a constant death threat. And I... I want to face mine head on. Candelita. Don't leave me. If you're still here, it's because our end is much bigger than life itself. I was gazing at the sky for a long time looking for a piece of my life. My stars aren't responding, nor shine the way to your laughter. I look for you, lost in dreams. I look for you, lost in dreams. Seek for you, flying in the sky. I was gazing at the sky for a long time looking for a piece of my life. My stars aren't responding, nor shine the way to your laughter. Waves dispersing before my eyes, to a legion of your memories. Robbing me of the shape of your face, leaving behind only the silent sand. I look for you, lost in dreams. The noise of the people wrapping me in a veil, I'm searching for you, flying in the sky. The wind has taken you like an old handkerchief. And all I can do is go on searching those familiar landscapes in places so mysterious. But I just can't find... you. As I look for you in every footstep, I draw your picture in the shadows - footsteps and shadows now lost. Luck was not my companion. I look for you, lost in dreams. The noise of the people wrapping me in a veil, I'm searching for you, flying in the sky. The wind has taken you like an old handkerchief. And all I can do is go on searching those familiar landscapes in places so mysterious. But I just can't find... you. I look for you, lost in dreams. The noise of the people wrapping me in a veil, I'm searching for you, flying in the sky. The wind has taken you like an old handkerchief. And all I can do is go on searching those familiar landscapes in places so mysterious. But I just can't find... you. And I search for you...
