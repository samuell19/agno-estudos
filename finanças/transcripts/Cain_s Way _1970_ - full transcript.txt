You smell worse than some boar hog. - You barrel-bellied bastard, you don't smell like no fresh jasmine yourself. - Don't like your name-calling-- (gun fires) - Settle down. Both of you.

(music box plays) - Turn that fool thing off, 'fore I take it from you! You put that gun away, before you shoot yourself. (gun fires) - Tucker, what the hell's going on down there? - Oh, nothing. Cawley just damn near shot his foot off, is all. Damn fool kid's been nothing but trouble ever since that Yankee prison. - Well, you better get him to shut up, or I'm coming down there to spill some guts! - Now what in the hell's wrong with you? - You ain't getting it. I'll kill you 'fore you get it. My mama give this to me, ain't nobody gonna take it away from me. - Oh, shut up, you crazy bastard. Don't try it, Billy. I'd hate to have to kill you. - Should not have said that. My mama was a lady. I had a daddy, too. You just better remember that. (laughs) - What's so funny to you? - You know, I'm sure gonna have a case of sorries for all them blue bellies down in Gold Creek when they don't have no spending money come Saturday night. (laughs) - Well don't count your chickens so fast, we aint' got that payroll yet. - Yeah, but we're gonna. - Yeah, we ain't gonna get the damn thing, neither, if you two keep jaw jacking, not tending to your business. Now both of you, shut up! - [Amison] Here they come! (suspenseful music) - Uh-uh, you ready? - Yeah! - Yeah. - Yeah! Whoa, whoa. - Whoa! Alright, alright, let's move it! - Hey, mother nature is a sergeant. - Yeah, well I'll tell you, I'd rather have mother nature anytime. - Alright, alright, let's move the log, we haven't got all damn day. - Keep your stripes on, Sarge. (gun fires) - Hold it right there, Yankee! Now step down real slow and drop them guns. (shouts battle cry) (guns fire) - I got you! (guns fire) - Get on back here! (guns fire) (soldiers shout) (groans) - Tucker! Tucker, how's Cawley? - He's still alive, but his guts look mighty sick. - You shouldn't have shot that boy, Sergeant. (gun fires) (gun fires) (gun fires) (laughs) (gun fires) - Great day in the morning! That sure was some dandy shooting over there! - I bet you could've kept him going another 15 yards before he hit dirt! (laughs) - Farrette, will you quit your funning and get the box out of the wagon. - You heard the boss, move! - Aye. - Be quick about it! - Come here, Yankee! (laughs) - Please don't kill me! I'll do anything, please! - That's more like it. Hey, what do you know? I got me a crying blue belly. (laughs) Hey! You got a key for this here thing? - No. No, they keep it at the fort. - The fort? - Hey Barry, this baby ain't got no key for it! Now what am I gonna do? - You know what the man said. Hurry up, and be quick about it. - Alright. Come here. Come here. - No! No. (cries) - Billy Joe, what are you doing? - I'm cutting the chain off! (laughs) - For God's sake. (cries) (laughs) - One strongbox, compliments of the Union Army. (soldier sobs) (laughs) - Why didn't you kill him, Billy Joe? (cries) - Farrette, let him go! He won't make a mile. (laughs) - Come on out of here. (laughs) - He can't ride. - Sure like to take this young one with me, Amison. - You know our law. - Yep. (coughs) - You... (coughs) You ain't gonna leave me like this. Please, please, Tuck. Take me with you. - I'm sorry, kid. There ain't no way. (gun fires) - Come on, let's get the hell out of here. (laughs) - Hey Sarge, what are we gonna do with these prisoners? - Well now, Crawford, you know we don't take any prisoners. (group hoots) (guns fire) (gun fires) (group whoops gleefully) - Hey, wait for me! - Settle down, settle down. - Tucker, let's go. Take that out, boy, Tucker.

Captain's the best commander I knew in the war. - Hey, I don't recollect you ever liking Cain so much. Just what you got on your mind, Amison? - Kind of a surprise. - (laughs) Captain Cain. Damn almighty, I remember how he used to lead us against them Yankees! (laughs) - Yeah, Billy Joe, that was a long time ago. Just you don't forget how he got out of that damn Yankee prison and we didn't. - Well, you can bet he had a good reason for that. - Yeah, he damn well did, lots of money! - That ain't right, Farrette, you talking about the captain like that. He's our leader. - Yeah, was our leader, is right. - Just wait, Farrette, the captain will ram them words down your throat! - Alright, come on, quit your gumming, let's get at it. Come on. - Alright, Cain, here we come, ready or not! - Pa, Pa! Pa! Ma wants you to bring some salt pork in from the shed. - Oh, does she now, huh? Well now, son. Have you burned off supper? - You bet, Ma's had me doing girl's work, washing clothes. - She has, now? Well, we're gonna have to talk to Ma about that. I can't have my boy doing girl's work, now can I? - No, sir. Ma says supper's almost ready. - Oh yeah? Listen, go on inside, tell your mom I'll be along directly. - Hi there, Captain. - Well, I'll be. Let's see now, last time I saw all you boys, you were in a Yankee prison. - Well, they finally even had to let us out. (laughs) This is a mighty fine place you got here, Captain. Not quite as fancy as what you had before, but you don't mind if we rest up a bit, do you? - No, not at all. Water's right over yonder for the horses. - Hey, Captain, you remember me? - Oh yes, yes, I remember you, Billy Joe, and Tucker there, and Garret, Crawford, Farrette, Brinson. - I'd reckon we'd be kinda hard to forget, wouldn't we, Captain? (group laughs) - Say, seems to me there's one of you fellows missing, the young fellow, what was his name? - Oh, you mean Cawley. - That's right, yes, Cawley. - Well, I reckon you might say he just had no guts for it. - You bloodsucking bastard, I wish it'd been you, instead of that young one. - I'm just gonna give you the chance! - Hey, hold it, Crawford, Crawford, Tucker. Come on, now, we're guests of the good captain here. We don't wanna insult him by having no shootout in the front yard. - Just why did you come here, Amison? - Well, right now I'd like to borrow some tools, see if I can get this box open. - Certainly, help yourself, tools right over yonder by the shed. - Thank you, Captain. - You're welcome. (horse whinnies) - [Farrette] Get up in here. - Who were those men? Couple of them look familiar. - Oh, it's nothing for you to worry your pretty little head about, honey, they're just some boys I knew a long time ago, during the war. - They gonna be here long? - Why? - Well, I thought I might cook some extra food, you know. - Well now, honey, you know we don't have that much-- - Hush now. You know we can't let anyone go away hungry. - Well, alright, you do whatever you wish, but you stay inside the cabin, you understand? - Anything you like. - Alright, dear. (laughs) - Crawford, you selfish bastard. (laughs) - Well, I never. - Well, I'll be a suck egg mule, I don't think I can count that high! - It sure will be fun trying, though. - Look at all them Yankee dollars. (laughs) - Well, my woman's sure gonna be glad to see me this time! - Woo, man! This is enough to start an army. - Yeah, a whole army. - You got something on your mind, Sarge? - We didn't ride no 30 miles out of our way for nothing, Crawford. - You mean the captain? - What about the captain? - Well, with this money and the captain leading us, we can show them damn Yankees we ain't licked yet. (group whoops gleefully) - [Billy] Here we go again! - Yeah, but just wait a minute, boys. I think you're kinda forgetting something. - What's that? - You know the captain didn't greet us with no open arms. - Yeah, I didn't see no loving kisses on his face. - Well, wait a minute, why you wanna go talking like that? You know the captain loves us. We his men! Why, shoot, he'd be proud to fight for the south again. - The south is dead, gentlemen. - The south will never die! - That's where you're wrong. The old south is dead, if you don't realize that by now, you're bigger fools than I thought you were. - I don't follow you, Captain. - How many men were killed when you stole that money? - Well, I don't know, three or four, maybe. - Only four, huh? - Well hell, Captain, they's just Yankees! - Alright. Go on, now, pick up that money and get on out of here. - Hey, hold on, Captain Cain. - I'm not a captain any longer. - We didn't ride 30 miles out here to open that box. - Why did you ride out here, Amison? - To ask you to join us. With that money and you leading us, why, we can build an army. Our army. - Yeah. Yeah, be just like old times, Captain, riding and shooting and everything! - I'm all through with violence, Billy Joe. I have a home here now, and my family. - Well, hell, Tucker's got a woman, too, don't you, Tuck? And your family can stay down Cripple Creek with Tucker's, and they could be company while we soldier. - That's not soldiering, Billy Joe, that's plundering. You're not talking about an army, you're talking about a band of outlaws. - I don't remember you minding it so much when we was called Cain's Cutthroats. - Ah, you just don't understand, do you? Now listen to me, men. You were all good soldiers once, yes, you were the best. We fought for a noble cause, we fought hard, but we lost, and that's that. And now there is no more Confederacy or cause. - The hell there ain't. They're gonna pay plenty for this. I've been waiting a long time, and now it's right. With that money, we can get even with those blue belly bastards. - That's just what I'm talking about, Amison. You don't want a cause, you want revenge. - That ain't no way to talk, Cain, after what we been through together. - Now listen to me, please, men. Why don't you just rest up here a while, feed your horses, and I'll have some wife rustle up some grub for you, and then you can be on your way. - So you won't lead us? - No. - Then you must be against us. - Hey, wait, Captain! Captain, with you leading us again... Hey, you remember how you took care of them blue bellies in Hayesville, huh? Rolled a whole barrel of powder down on them, and pow! Pieces of Yankee all over the place! - Yes, I remember, Billy Joe. - We get new uniforms and we make you a general. Yeah, a real, live general. - Look at yourself. Why, you haven't even washed the blood off yet. - I'm sorry, Captain, but it's the only way I could get the chain off his arm. Captain. - Take your hands off me, you simple little bastard! (suspenseful music) - Oh, now Captain, you should not have said that. I think the world of you, but you shouldn't be calling me no bastard. - He's called you that more than once, Billy Joe. You gonna let him get away with that? - I ain't no bastard. My mama was a lady. - Oh, Billy Joe, the high and mighty captain thinks you was. Yes, sir, you know, Billy? Captain thinks she was just like one of his field hens. - Justice, what's the matter? What do these men want? - Never mind, never mind, now you get on back in the house, hurry up. - Get back in the cabin, woman, we got business out here. - Now listen, men, this is my wife. - Well now, I'll be damned if that ain't Angie. Say, wasn't she your wife's house gal down on your pa's plantation? (laughs) - A nigger! Our high and mighty captain has married a nigger! Well now, I'll be! If that don't beat all I've ever seen. - Well, no wonder he was trying to hide her. - Yeah, he had to bring her way out here, so he could hide his hired yellow gal. - Hey Billy Joe, I think the captain owes us an explanation, especially since he called you a bastard. - Please, Amison, for God's sake, leave us in peace. I don't owe anybody any explanation. - The hell you don't. You called me a bastard. I would've died for you. I would've walked through the gates of Hell. All you had to do was ask me. And then you had to call me a bastard! (groans) - Get out of here, nigger! - Stand him up, stand him up! Stand him up! I wanna see why you won't go with us. Wanna make a stake for yourself, huh? Wanna be a pansy. Aw, what's wrong, nigger? - No! - Am I messing up your lover? (laughs) - Ah, get her up here. - You white trash! (groups laughs) (screams) - Get up, you nigger! Hey, look at that! - Yeah. - Tie the good captain to the hitching post. - Alright. - Yeah. - Tucker, take care of this nigger girl. (laughs) Oh, Billy Joe, no. - Get out of my way! - Please, please. - I'm gonna kill him! - Please listen to me, Billy Joe. - He said bad things about my mama. Now you heard him! - I know, I know. Why don't you get some water and throw it on him, so it'll cool him down and tighten him up at the same time. - Hey boy! - Mom! Mom! - Hold still, boy. - Mom! - Isn't that pretty? - [Tucker] (laughs) Yeah. - (laughs) Yeah! What you donna do, Sarge? - I'm gonna teach him a lesson. - You gonna take his gal? - No, we're all gonna get her. (group laughs) Hey, how you like that, nigger lover! - For God's sake, Amison! I'm begging you, please, leave her alone! - Would you listen to that? Our high and mighty captain is begging. - Mom, no! - [Amison] Bring him over here where she can see him. - Ah, there he is! (laughs) - Mom! - Not the boy! - Mom! - Well maybe if you see him, you won't fight so hard. - Mom! Mom! - You and the young one won't get killed, huh? - Mom! (group laughs) - Mom! Mom! - Yeah. Yeah, go, Sarge! - Mom! - Yeah. I like that. - I'm gonna kill every last one of you! I promise you, I'm gonna kill you! (group laughs) - Farrette, shut him up. - You dirty rat! (groans) (western music) - Oh, that's better, nigger. (group guffaws) - Stump her one for old Jefferson Davis. - [Farrette] Get her, Sarge. Get that rebel humper. - No! (group laughs) - [Farrette] Hold still, boy. - [Brinson] That's better than them old gals down in the corner! - [Amison] Give it to me, nigger. - No. Oh, no. - [Farrette] Get her, Sarge. You really got some style! (laughs) - [Tucker] Yeah, work out, Sarge. (Angie cries) - [Jodie] Mom, Mom! - [Farrette] Hold still, boy. (sobs) (group laughs) Get her, Sarge. Get her, come on, Sarge. - [Angie] No. - [Farrette] Hold still, boy. Go on, now! - Mom! - [Amison] Go on, Billy Joe. It's your turn. - You're dead, Amison, dead! I promise you, you're dead! - Ah, shut up, family man. - [Farrette] Yeah, nigger family! (laughs) - [Jodie] Mom! - Did he hurt you? I don't wanna hurt you. No! He didn't hurt you. You liked it from him. You liked it from him, but you don't like it from me. You don't want me. Tell me you don't want me. Tell me! (screams) You! (screams) Ow! - I'll see you in Hell, you little bastard. (gun fires) (gun fires) - My God, Billy Joe. - You're gonna kill him. - [Farrette] My God. Burn it! - [Amison] Brinson, get the kerosine. Farrette! - Get it. - Throw this way up in there, I'll get the horses! - Come on, boy, come on! Let's go. - [Amison] Hurry up, Brinson! That a boy, let's go. - Come on, get in there. - Come on! (group hoots) (gun fires) (gun fires) (gun fires) - For the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruption shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, death is swallowed up in victory. Oh death, where is thy sting? Oh grave, where is they victory? But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory, to our lord, Jesus Christ. (solemn music) Oh lord, we beseech thee, take into thy merciful care the souls of this woman and this child. To wait thy good times, until the raising of the dead on the last day. We therefore commit these bodies to the ground. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. In sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life. Whoa there, son. You'll start bleeding again. You know, if that ball had been a hair closer, you'd be a dead man. - Did you... - Yes, yes. I gave them a proper service from the book. - (sniffs) I want, I wanted... - No, no. Better you remember them the way they were, not that way. - So help me God, I'll kill them. I'll kill every last one of them! - Vengeance is mine, said the lord. He will seek out your enemies and smite them down. - Well the lord will have to get there before I do. - You're in no shape to move anywhere, son. - Oh, I gotta. (thunder rumbles) - [Preacher] Get up, get up, get up! (lightning cracks) Here you are, son. Now hold on, son, the body needs nourishment if it's gonna heal. - I don't need any food. Killing is the only thing that's gonna heal me. - Now it seems to me a man needs more than just a pair of legs to go on the trail. Oh, I looked all over your place yesterday, son. Appears to me that's all you got. - Well, let's get going. - Oh, no, I gotta follow me calling elsewhere. I can't deviate from the course plotted by the lord. - Not even to track down killers like Amison and that bunch? - I shall love thy neighbor as thy... Amison? Did you say Amison? Calder Amison? - Yeah. Amison, Tucker, Farrette, Crawford. - Hold on there, son, hold on. Oh, hey. Calder Amison, wanted for robbery, murder, and you name it. $1,500, dead or alive, yeah. Let's see, Walter Crawford, Billy Joe Mason, Cain's... - Who are you, anyway? - Oh, excuse me. I didn't introduce myself. Simms, Preacher Simms, servant of the lord. - A preacher, huh? With wanted posters? - Well, not ordained, exactly, but close to it. Sorta called to the cloth. - Why the posters? - Well, I sorta mix vocations, a shepherd of the flock, a hunter of men. - Oh, a bounty hunter, huh? - Well, for lack of a better word. Matter of fact, I've been tracking Amison and his gang for quite some time. Wish I could've been a mite sooner. - Good, we could track them down together. - We? Oh, I'm sorta spoiled for working alone. I appreciate the offer, though. - There are six of them, you know. - Six of them? The odds are kinda grim. - Now listen, they served under me during the war. I know them inside and out, how they think, how they move, everything. - Just what kind of a split did you have in mind? - Split? Oh, you mean money? You think I want money? - Well, the thought occurred. - Oh. I don't want money. All I want is to see every last one of them dead. - Well, I don't see any reason why we should hesitate any longer. That is, if you feel up to moving. - Don't you worry about me. You know, we've been on this trail a long while now, we haven't gotten any closer to them yet. - Patience, son, patience, the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong. Ecclesiastes, nine 11. - Alright, you can skip the sermon. - Liquor and tobacco, the stepchildren of Satan. Rejoice in the benevolence of God! We should be on them before nightfall. - How do you know? - Now who do you suppose threw away that cigar butt? Amison! You forget, I've been doing this quite a few years. Son, you got any ideas how an invalid and an old man like me is gonna take on six armed killers? - Sure, catch them with their britches down. - Amen. A life for a life, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, arm for an arm, a foot for a foot. Just one favor, brother Cain. - Yeah? - Don't mutilate the heads. - What do you mean? - Well, simple, how is poster money paid? - You just bring in a criminal or his body to the authorities, I reckon. - Uh-huh, long as it can be recognized. But experience has taught me it ain't necessary to bring in the whole body. Long as they recognize the face, I can collect the money. - You mean you just take in the heads? - Notice that barrel on the side of the wagon? - Yeah. - Salt brine, preserves things quite a while. - You mean you got some in there now? - Three of them. (chuckles) - Giddy up! - Say, did I ever tell you fellas about me and that marshal over in Coonskin? - Yeah, yeah. - Many times, Crawford. (giggles) - Well did I ever tell you what about the-- - We heard that one, too. - Ah, I know I didn't tell you one about me and that great big old washtub-sized whore down there in Macon. - Yes you did, Crawford. - [Crawford] Damn, I could've sworn I never told that one. - Hey Sarge! Where'd you get that liquor, you been holding out on us? - Hell no, I've been saving it. Here's to ex-Captain Cain, late of Greenfield Mansion in the best 2,000 acres of bottomland in Alabama. (group laughs) It's a celebration! Tomorrow, we're gonna go into Gold Creek and spend some of them Yankee dollars and have a good time. - Hot damn, I'm gonna see my woman! I'm so full I'm about to spill me all over! (laughs) - Say, you still got that whore hid out in that cabin of yours? - Listen, you keep your slimy, fat ass mouth shut about my woman, or I'm gonna cram my fist right down your throat! - I'm gonna bust your head wide open, you snake-eyed, fat-bellied-- (gun fires) - Now come on, this is no time for fighting, it's time for celebrating! Come on, pass that jug around! (laughs) - Boy, that sure is good liquor. Come on, man! (wolf howls) - Could be coyotes. Maybe Indians. But ain't nobody out here, except us. (group laughs) - Hey Brinson, where you going? - Going to take care of some private. - Don't wander too far. (plays harmonica) (coughs) - Crawford, you better go see what happened to Brinson. - Aw Sarge, why me? I ain't got no privates to take care of! Man, he's always got me doing something like this. (suspenseful music) (chokes) - You're mighty brave with women and children, aren't you, Brinson, huh? You can't scream, huh? Go ahead, go ahead, fight it. You'll just break quicker and easier. (neck snaps) - It's Cain! (horn blows) (gun fires) (gun fires) (man shouts) (gun fires) (gun fires) (gun fires) - Well, Brother Cain, so much for your highly technical military tactic. - Well, we got two of them, anyway. - A man's work is never done. - What'd you find out? - Pretty profitable night, Brother Cain. The lord taketh and the lord giveth. About 2,000 worth. What'd you say? - I said what'd you find out? - Oh, well it seems two of them on horse are headed southwest, and one to the south. That's in the direction of Gold Creek, the Sodom and Gomorrah of the west. - And what about the other one? - The other one's headed northwest, in the direction of Cripple Creek. - Cripple Creek. That must be Tucker. We'll pick him up and trail the others later. That suit you? - The lord goes before us by day, in a pillar of cloud to lead the way, and by night in a pillar of fire, to give us light. Exodus, 13. - Exodus, 13. (suspenseful music) (gun cocks) (gun fires) (screams) Shut up. - For God's sake, who are you? - Justice Cain. - The captain? (door closes) - Sorry, preacher, he went before he cameth. - Brother Cain, I distinctly asked you not to mutilate the head. Neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus, our lord. We therefore commit this body to the ground. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, in sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life. Amen. Care to participate, Brother? Not very Christian of you, Brother Cain. - Nor hypocritical. - It won't stay down. My dealing's with the evil in a man. Once the evil's removed, my duty is to commend his soul to the almighty. - You got room for a passenger? - You know, we're not touring the countryside for pleasure, Mrs. Tucker. - I'm not his missus. - Jezebel. All wickedness is but little to the wickedness of a woman, Ecclesiastes, 25 19. - [Rita] I can cook. - I ain't heard no complaints about mine. - I'm sure that there are other things I could do for you. (laughs) - Don't you realize what I've just done in there? - Sure, you blew Tucker's head off. - You don't have to remind me. - He had it coming. - Ah, sure, sure, I know, but there's so many other ways. - Well, do I go with you? - I can't see it, Brother Cain. I usually find women to be a hindrance. - I know where Amison is. - Where? - I know, that's enough for right now. - How do you know? - Tucker had a big mouth, and he was in a hurry to meet him. - Where is he? Where is he? - I learned a long time ago not to give things away. You wanna know where he is, you have to pay for it. - You mean you want a ride out of here, huh? - That's right. - 1,500's a lot, brother. Perhaps we were a bit hasty in deciding. - Come on. (melancholy western music) - Giddy up! - Ho, ho! - Well, what's the trouble? - [Cain] There's no trouble, we've just come to a fork in the road. Well, which way do we go? - [Simms] Well, where does that road lead? - To where you can find Amison. - You're not too free with your information, are you? - Insurance, Mr. Cain, insurance. If you knew exactly where to go, I might not be along for this ride. - It's not Mr. Cain. Call me Justice. - They call me Rita. - And one other thing. I'm sorry about the way I treated you earlier. - Like I said, you had your reasons. - Giddy up! (gun fires) - Damn! You crazy bastard! - Who'd you think it was? The boogie man or Captain Cain? (laughs) - You gonna get killed that way. - What you gonna do, look me to death? I got your rifle right here. Anyway, you wouldn't have know it, even if it would've been the captain. - A man's got a right to sleep. - Yeah, well, we wouldn't be in this fix if you'd have made sure about him! - I thought he was dead. - Yeah, he's the most livingest white man I ever seen. And you know he's out to get us, all of us. And he sure knows how to do it, too. Yes, sir, you know, I wonder what happened to old Crawford. It wasn't no shotgun got him. - Ah, shut up. - No, siree. You know the old captain, he kinda sneak around as quiet as a mouse. (laughs) - I won't tell you again, shut up! - Oh, evening, Captain. (gun fires) Drop the rifle, nice and easy like. - What the hell do you want? - I want my money. - I should've figured it. - Well now, ain't no need you carrying more than your share, now is it? - I reckon you can go take it all. - Ain't give it much thought before now. - Go ahead, go on and enjoy spending it. - What makes you think I'm gonna leave you here to come hunt me down? - Not me, it's Cain. Every time you spend a dollar, you're gonna have to look over your shoulder. - Got something on your mind, Amison? - Uh-huh. You brought me to my senses. Listen, I won't deny it, you scared me plenty. - Did sorta look that way. (guffaws) You said you had something on your mind. What is it? - You know, ever stop to figure that Captain Cain's so busy hunting us that he wouldn't notice us hunting him? - Well, you know he ain't by his self. Somebody got Brinson, too. - Maybe that's to our advantage. - Now how you figuring that? - Well, they're too confident. By the time they get to noticing us hunting them, we can be on top of them, and it's too late. - I don't know. Oh, well. Alright, when do we start? - Just as soon as you put that cannon away, there. (laughs) - Excuse me. - I'd like to-- - I better see if the preacher needs any help. - Whoa. - What's the problem? - No problem. Matilda here has been pulling more of a load than she's used to, she needs a rest. - Way out here? - Nope, I just give her her head, she'll find the right place. - There's some water right over there. (horse whinnies) - Now look what you did. You went and hurt Matilda's feelings! She would've found it on her own. (melancholy western music) (chuckles) I see you ain't dead, after all. - What are you talking about? You got a dirty mind for a preacher. - You're gonna preach, you gotta know the good from the evil. The lips of a strange woman are like a honeycomb, and their mouth is smoother than oil, but her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edge sword. Proverbs, five three. Course, I don't say you ain't got a right to your own thoughts. (laughs) - Well never mind my thoughts, you just tend that skillet. - Now what's the matter? - Look over yonder. It looks like you could've been right! - [Amison] Yeah. - You know, if that is the captain, and he was afraid of us hunting him down, sure would have no fire going, now would he? - Well, let's just go over there and see if it is him. - Come on, giddy up. - Hey, would you look at that? - And what do you know, there's Tucker's woman. You can bet one thing, old Tucker wasn't in no shape to argue when she left. (gun cocks) - Hey, wait a minute! Wait a minute, I got a better idea. - Where'd you get that? - I had it since the bank job at Four Corners. (gun fires) (bomb explodes) (yelps) (screams) - Get back! (gun fires) - What was that? - Sure wasn't anything God wrought. - Hey man, what'd you do that for? - Well, I didn't really seem fond of your plan. - We gotta get out of here. - I'll look and see if we can still get the wagon out. - No, no, don't, that's just what they want. - Who's they? - We'll sure as hell soon find out. (gun fires) (gun fires) (gun fires) Damn, I must be getting rusty, Yankee rifle, too. - One thing, we ain't surrounded. - The best way I can figure, there's two of them. - Well? - Well, what? - Well, seems to me we got ourselves between a rock and a hard place. - Any suggestions? - Well, you're the soldier. - Well, you're the bounty hunter. - True, true, but I ain't had much experience being hunted. (gun fires) - Well, you could make a suggestion. - Well I could, if I was up yonder and they was down here. - Alright, we'll have to wait here. - Well, Jezebel. Gird up now they loins, like a man. Job, 38 two. (gun fires) - (laughs) If that don't beat all. (laughs) (gun fires) (gun fires) - Your idea ain't working so good. - Well, we got them pinned down, don't we? - Yeah, but they got more food and water and everything than we got. (gun fires) - Well, it's not over yet, just stay ready. (gun fires) (gun fires) (gun fires) Captain! Hey, Captain, come out where we can see you! - I'll see you, Amison, dead! - Hey Captain, I see you got yourself another woman! I can tell you one thing for sure, she ain't as tender as your nigger gal is! (laughs) Hey, there he goes! (gun fires) - Damn! I missed him. He's luckier than any man I ever known. You know, Amison, wouldn't be such a bad idea to get the hell outta here about right along now. - Nah, just stay put. He's not gonna be so lucky next time. - Hey, hey, looky there. Ain't that Tucker's girl cutting out? - [Amison] Yeah. - Damn, she sure does run funny. (gun fires) (gun fires) (gun fires) (gun fires) God almighty! Where'd that come from? - It looks like we're caught in the crossfire. - What we gonna do? - Not much we can do. Just sit here and wait for them to pick us off. - Is that all you do is light that cigar? - My last one. - You know, it might work. - What's that? - Give me your coat and get that rifle. (gun fires) - What makes you think the captain's gonna fall for that? - 'Cause the captain is an officer and a gentleman, and he plays by the rules. Hey, Captain! Captain, I got a proposition for you! - What's on your mind, Amison? - We got Billy Joe over here, he's got a bullet in him! You want for him to bleed to death? He's the one that shot your young one. Okay, Farrette. - Man, you must think I'm crazy, I ain't going out there and get shot. (gun cocks) - You're gonna go, one way or the other. - What'd you say you want me to tell the man? - Just tell him we got Billy Joe over here. We'll trade him for a six hour start. And while you're jawing at him, I'll lay one into him, then we'll both take care of the old man. - Yeah, but what if he don't fall for it, Amison? - Then we're both dead. (groans) - Captain! Captain Cain! I'm coming out, don't shoot! (suspenseful music) - Farette, you're one of the best men I ever knew. (gun fires) (shouts) (gun fires) (gun fires) - Thank God you're safe. Farrette. You can't do that. Look, you can't leave him here. Help me get him into the wagon. - Here. (cries in pain) Come on, get up, get up. (groans) - I must apologize for my bad shooting. I was girding up my loins, and they caught me with my pants, with my skirt up. (laughs) - Girding up his loins. - Oh. Excuse me, Jezebel. (laughs) - Thank you. Where's the preacher? - Scouting for Amison. - Farrette? - I bandaged him, he needs a doctor. - So? - We gotta get him to Gold Creek now. - Why? - Because he'll die. - That's his damn problem. - What is this hellish grudge you've got for Amison and his men? - You heard what Amison said about me. Yeah, you heard him. Yeah, she was part nigger. She was my wife's servant. Just like one of the family. While I was away in the war, fighting, my wife died in childbirth. I come back, everything was gone. Burned. Just Angie, Angie and the boy. As far as the boy knew, Angie was his mother. So I married her. I headed west. I thought I could... I thought I could build a new life for that boy and woman. And then Amison came with that gang. They raped that poor woman. Killed her, burned my home down. They killed my son. - What happened? - He just told me what happened to his family. - Oh. - He'll be back. - I hope so. I lost Amison's track. He may still be around. (whimsical western music) (owl hoots) - I'm sorry that I lied to you about Amison. Tucker never said anything to me. He just came and took me, like he always did. Preacher was right, I'm a jezebel. He could see it. From saloon to saloon, from one man to another. - Come on, hey. - No, let me finish. Then Tucker came. He offered me a way out, and I took it. Then you came. You looked like a... So I'm sorry. - Oh, dear. - And the lord caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept, and he took one of his ribs, and closed up instead the flesh thereof. And of the rib which the lord God took from man, he made a woman. Bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh. - You haven't talked all day. - You murderer. - You mean him? - Men, you're worse than wolves. At least they kill to eat. - He fell off the wagon. Listen, he's lucky, he died in his sleep. - You're lying. You weren't lying last night, were you? You know, about us going to California? You and me? - No. But only after I'm finished. - Amison and Billy Joe. Killing them won't bring Angie and Jodie back. What's happened is done, it's finished. - Not yet. - Well, can't you let the law do it for you? - I'll do it my own way. - Aw, Justice! - And the lord set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him. And Cain went out from the presence of the lord, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden. (plays "Camptown Races") (laughs) - Oh, okay, Billy, how about buying ourselves another drink? - (laughs) Honey, I'll buy you the whole saloon. Woo! Give me a drink. - Oh, Billy! - Takes money to drink here, Reb. - Alright. I'll tell you what, Yankee, you do the pouring, and this here rebel will do the paying, alright? (laughs) - It's gonna cost you extra, alright? (moans) - Fire one! (laughs) - Billy! (screams) - Hey. - Hey! Billy. - Gin. Hey, wait. Hey, you take care of my money, Yankee! - Don't you worry about it, Reb. - [Zelda] Zelda likes. ("Camptown Races" plays) Do you like Zelda, huh? - Yes, ma'am. - Upsy-daisy. (laughs) Oh, Billy. (chuckles) - Don't touch that. - Okay. I was only kidding you. Don't get mad. Billy, don't get mad. (laughs) (moans) (moans) - Stop! Don't do that. - Oh. (laughs) Billy, come on. Make love to Zelda, be a good boy. - Mama? Mama. You like me, don't you, Mama? I won't tell nobody. (giggles) - What the... What's wrong with you? Don't you act like a man? - Mama, don't. Don't. Mama. - Get out. Get out of here, you bastard! (suspenseful music) - You don't like me. You never did like me. No girl ever did like me, even my mama didn't like me! She said I was a-- (screams) (shouts) (shrieks) (moans) (suspenseful music) (screams) - Billy Joe. - No. Justice, don't! - You can't stop him, woman. - But... - Thy will be done, on Earth, as it is in Heaven. - [Cain] Billy. Billy Joe. - Captain? Hey. Hey Captain. They're after me, Captain. Yankees all over the place, sir. Any orders? (gun fires) (woman screams) (gun fires) (cries in pain) (gun fires) (dog howls) (cries in pain) Captain Cain? Please, Captain. Why? Why you shoot me like this, Captain? It ain't right, Captain. It just ain't right. The others, Captain. We gotta get the rest of the men. The Yankees got Sarge! We gotta go get him. - We'll get them, we'll get them, Billy Joe. We'll get them together. You and me, together. (cries in pain) - Mama! Mama, it hurts me! - Amison, where is he? Where is he, Billy Joe? Where's Amison, where's Amison? - Yankees, they're gonna kill him, we don't hurry. - Hurry where, where? Where is he, where's Amison? Where is he? - Captain... It's all running out of me, Captain. It's all running-- (whimpers) - If you don't tell me, Billy Joe, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. Where is he? Amison, Amison. - Pa... (groans) (music box plays) - Why didn't you kill him like a man? - She's got a point, son. It ain't natural. The ways of the lord are strange. He works his miracles in wondrous ways. You seek the wind, you'll find the whirlwind. - What the hell are you talking about? - I mean, son, the point of your revenge is passed. Now it's lust. The lust for killing. - Lust for killing? Lust for killing? (scoffs) Well you got some right to talk. At least I don't go riding around with a barrel full of heads floating in salt brine! - It could be I'm wrong, son, but I have kept it clean. At least they died like men. May the lord be with you, Brother Cain, 'cause if he isn't, you'll ride alone. Giddy up! Come on, come on! - [Commander] Detail, forward, half right, ha! Detail, halt! - Take the patch off. Got a light, blue belly? - Pick a post. - Amison! - Well, if it isn't our high and mighty Captain Cain. The Yankees are about to deprive you of a particular pleasure. - That's right, Amison! - Well, it's a good captain. This is Captain Justice Cain of Cain's Cutthroats, in the late Confederate Army. He's a hell of a man in a scrap, but he married a nigger bitch, one his daddy used to hump back on the plantation. She wasn't such a bad hump, either, was she, Captain? - Damn you, Amison, shut up! (chuckles) - Well, you got all of them, Captain. All of them but me. I may be fixing to die, but I'll die knowing you didn't get me. (chuckles) - Detail! (drum rolls) (laughs) - Prepare to fire! Ready! Aim! Fire! (guns fire) - No, no! (gun fires) - Detail, recover, ha! Hut, ha! Break rank, ha!
