(murmuring) Newsman: After a brief interval, the PLO leader was assured that the size of the Jericho region was still under negotiation. He signed the document and added a few comments. Finally, with the briefest of handshakes, a deal was done, at the very last minute. (applause) ♪ ♪ (helicopters whirring) (crowds yelling) Ashrawi: On July 1st, 1994, Yasser Arafat returned to his home, and reclaimed his position as the Palestinian leader. It was an ambivalent return. He came back and had to govern Palestine, which was divided and driven apart. Or perhaps Israel brought him back in order to control him. What was the price we had to pay for his return home? Was this one of Oslo's minefields? Or was it the first step toward peace and the liberation of Palestine? ♪ ♪ Ala: As we made our way to Palestine, my heart pounded, and I was choked with the emotion of the moment. I wept as I had never wept before, kissing and hugging all my relatives and friends. (excited chatter) The last time I met my father in Jordan, I hinted that I might be coming home soon. He cried and raised his hand, swearing he will prepare a feast on my return. My sadness was that my father had passed away just four month earlier, after waiting to my return for so many years. Soon, I called Uri. I said I am finally back in my childhood home. He greeted me with the Arab words of welcome, Ahlan wa sahlan, and told me he was truly pleased to hear my voice. We have become neighbors at last. (indistinct chatter) Savir: One week after Abu Ala's return to Abu Dis, we met once again in Taba. This time, in order to negotiate the second stage of the Oslo process-- Israel's withdrawal from the West Bank. I spread out the maps we had kept secret until then. ♪ ♪ The Oslo Accord stated Israel will withdraw from most of the West Bank within a year, and the Palestinians were expecting to receive control over the land immediately. But Israel demanded a gradual withdrawal, and offered the Palestinians full control on only two percent of the land. The remaining 98 percent will be controlled by the Israeli Army. Arafat stared at the map silently, and then announced that it was an unbearable humiliation. "These are prison camps," he yelled. "You want to destroy me." With those words, Arafat left the room. (indistinct chatter) Ala: What you are suggesting deviates from the signed agreement, I shouted. You keep 98 percent of the land? We won't accept that. You can enforce this approach on Arafat and push him into a corner, but remember this, a one-sided agreement will not last. Savir: Abu Ala stood up without saying another word, and summoned his driver. We exchanged a polite and cold handshake, and we each went our separate ways. (indistinct chatter) ♪ ♪ As hours went by, we waited nervously in the hotel's lobby. Some Israeli reporters informed us that Arafat had issued a statement about the talks collapsing. We were all on edge, but refused to cave in. (speaking Hebrew) (playing, singing folk music) Savir: Later that evening, Arafat's personal assistant came rushing towards me. "Arafat asks that you come to Abu Ala's room immediately." She said, "He's collapsed." I rushed to Abu Ala's room, and found him lying in bed, pale as a ghost, trembling, nodding in and out of consciousness. ♪ ♪ Hold on my friend, I whispered. I need you to stay with me. The doctors found Abu Ala's collapse to be a result of extreme fatigue caused by the many hours of negotiations. (siren blaring) But I knew the truth. The map I presented to him had broken his heart. There was something very personal in peace-making. It wasn't a political... festival. It wasn't a political ambition. It was a very human ambition. ♪ ♪ There's a symbolic... picture, where people went to Israeli tanks in the streets and put olive branches. The tanks that destroyed your lives and your homes, the army that killed your kids and oppressed you. People went out and gave them flowers and gave them olive branches, and felt that this was it. This is the end of the conflict. This is the end of the occupation. ♪ ♪ It was a moment of hope... a moment of promise. But people's hopes were dashed and it didn't materialize into a reality. So, yes, of course, I feel... sad and responsible. ♪ ♪ (Peres speaking Hebrew) ♪ ♪ Beilin: I had a meeting with Yair and Ron. We all felt that the time was running out, and that we had to act fast. We agreed on deliberations that would lead to a permanent agreement, utilizing the same framework we used in Oslo. Quick, discreet talks, and no empty slogans. Mahmoud Abbas and I deliberated over the drafts for almost two years, behind the scenes, without the racket of the Taba Hotel. We touched on the most sensitive points of the process, for the very first time. At least, theoretically, we had a document in our hands, with a comprehensive solution. A withdrawal to the '67 borders, the establishment of a Palestinian state, of course, keeping the settlement blocks intact, and making Jerusalem the capital of both nations. My plan was to set up a meeting with Rabin. I told him that I would like to meet with him about the permanent solution. And he said, "As soon as possible," so I told him, let's do it when I return from the United States on Saturday, November 11th. No one could've guessed under what circumstances that meeting would take place. ♪ ♪ Savir: On September 5th, we reassembled in Taba. I must admit, after our last encounter, I wasn't looking forward to another round of this endless boxing match. We were stressed, exhausted, and most of all, fed up. It was not long before the negotiation, once again, deteriorated to an exchange of accusations. (indistinct conversation) Kurtzer: It was the nastiest meeting I've ever been in my life. We just wanted to be anywhere but in that room. As I was leaving the room, I turned around, and the Israeli and Palestinian delegations are talking to each other and having a cup of coffee. I think it underscores the point that part of what happens in negotiations is the... humanization of the other side. You no longer see just the, quote, unquote, "enemy," but you see a person. And you learn about that person's family and their ups and downs and their happy moments, and you get a sense of how committed they are to peace. And you never are able to translate that to the public. (praying in Hebrew) Savir: That evening, we improvised a Friday prayer service. We lit candles, and much to the astonishment of the Palestinians, Singer recited the Kiddush prayer. We opened with, "Everybody Loves Saturday Night," in three languages. Afterwards, Abu Ala and myself joked around by imitating the Peres and Arafat conversation, while Uri taught Asfour how to sing "My Yiddishe Momme." It was nice to kid around again. ♪ ♪ Later that night, I received a call from Jerusalem. A bus exploded in the center of the capital. (sirens blaring) (indistinct yelling) (speaking Hebrew) (TV playing indistinctly) Savi: We sat and watched the news silently. No one said a word. No one doubted our Palestinian friends opposed terror and that it was directed towards them as well. Two days later, Abu Ala called me up from his room, and asked me to watch the Arab evening news with him. We watched images of a seven-year-old boy's funeral, a boy who had been killed that day by the Israeli Army. ♪ ♪ Abu Ala was right when he said that neither side has dominion over suffering. ♪ ♪ That night, Abu Ala and I reached the final draft of the Oslo-B Agreement.

The sight you see was impossible, was unthinkable just two years ago. (applause) Only poets dreamt of it, and to our great pain, soldier and civilians went to their death to make this moment possible. Shaath: These were the years of hope, when the two peace camps felt that they were somehow... vindicated. That they are bringing to their people the fruits. (newsman speaking Hebrew) Newsman: Abu Ala, are you more optimistic now than you've been, let's say, one day after Oslo 1? (all laughing) Yes. Yes, I am optimistic. -Yes? -I believe that... the process we agreed together, it will continue, despite of all difficulties we face, but it will succeed later. We have, both, we have a good will to push this process forward. Newsman: Uri? I concur with what Abu Ala said, and we really have no choice. And there's some good common language around this table, as you can see. (newsman speaking Hebrew) What is a Jewish sport? And the saying is, speech-making. (laughter) I start to believe, Chairman Arafat, that you are close to be Jewish. (laughter, applause) (laughter) Abraham is my grandfather! Abraham is my grandfather! (laughter) (newsman speaking Hebrew) Our partner. Our cousin. (applause) Yitzhak Rabin. (clapping, cheering) (Netanyahu speaking Hebrew) (crowd jeering) (crowd cheering) Savir: Rabin and Arafat felt isolated in the hostile environment. The peace camp wasn't going out into the streets to protest. Instead, they chose to avoid confrontation. The peace objectors, Hamas on the Palestinian side, and the Greater Israel camp on our side, now own public opinion. The face-off wasn't between Israel and the Palestinians, but between those who supported peace and those that objected to it. (newsman speaking Hebrew) (indistinct chatter) Savir: In early October, John Friedman, a friend of Peres, convinced him to arrange a rally in support of the peace process. Peres urged Rabin to accept the initiative. But Rabin wondered, would people even leave their homes? Those days, Rabin was more pessimistic than ever. (crowd cheering) ♪ ♪ Newsman: If too much is heard in the Middle East from the few extremists, tonight the supporters of peace emerged in a huge rally in Tel Aviv. This is the young Israel, tired of army service, tired of chasing Palestinian stone-throwing children through refugee camps. All sides are mobilizing, for this is now becoming one of the most contentious moments in Israeli history. For the first time, perhaps, the surprise is fading, and there is a popular momentum for peace. ♪ ♪ (Peres speaking Hebrew) (crowd cheering) (singing in Hebrew) (Peres speaking Hebrew) (crowd cheering, applauding) (Rabin speaking Hebrew) (crowd cheering) (Peres speaking Hebrew) (gunshots echo) ♪ ♪ (speaking Hebrew) (sirens blaring) (Peres speaking Hebrew) ♪ ♪ (indistinct chatter) (crying) (indistinct yelling) (yelling in Hebrew) (Peres speaking Hebrew) (crowd murmuring) Erekat: You know, these people were fighting each other.

I was there every single meeting, and I saw how their relationships developed. After the day when Rabin was assassinated, Arafat told me, "They assassinated the peace process in Israel." And I disagreed with him. No, Israel is not about an individual. It's about an institution. It's about this, they... have replacements and so on.

He was already the prime minister, and on Saturday, I came to his home with all the maps and all the material. And I said to him, this is the agreement that we have with Abu Mazen. I think that we can go for it. You have the exact border, you have the solution for Jerusalem, with everything else, and... I think that now is the time. I mean, everybody's so confused, including ourselves, but still... there is a support for peace, even more than before, as a result of the assassination, and let us, "use it," for his memory and finish the job. And, he listened to me very carefully, for two hours... and then he said, "Not now. "Not now. I don't think that people are ready to leave the Jordan Valley," which was part of the map, so that Israel should withdraw from the Jordan Valley. (sniffles) And, uh... "I think that today to bring it to the people will... is immature." Well, it is always immature, but this is an opportunity. I was not... strong enough to tell him it is your biggest mistake. Reconsider it. I did not come again to him with this. And, uh... maybe it is in me. Maybe it is part of my weakness. Maybe it was just a mistake, I don't know.

I had, I had, apparently, to fight more for, for, uh... for the permanent agreement. ♪ ♪ Savir: On May 5th, 1996, I found myself back in the familiar surroundings of the Hilton Taba. I wondered about the three years that passed since I first met Abu Ala in Oslo. Since then, our lives had become a combination of promise and anguish. The process we started had withstood tremendous trials. Since the first day in Oslo, and up until this current exchange in May '96, 1,100 days of peace talks had passed. When we said our farewells that day, I never imagined that it would be my last and final meeting with Abu Ala in my official role as head of the Israeli negotiating team. If I had known it was all going to end, maybe I would have come up with something more intelligent to say to him. But all I said to Abu Ala was, see you soon, my friend. Newsman: Nearly 80 percent of Israel's four million voters streamed to polling stations. Everyone seemed to understand why this election was important. In suburban Tel Aviv, voters chose Peres. The peace process means hope, so that he won't be in a bloody army or in a bloody war. Newsman: In the West Bank city of Hebron, Jewish settlers voted for Netanyahu. Peres want to be, to give our land to the Arabs, so, of course, we are voting for Benjamin Netanyahu.
