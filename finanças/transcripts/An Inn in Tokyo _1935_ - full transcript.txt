An Inn in Tokyo Wait here, the two of you. Will you let me work here? I'm a good worker. No! I came all this way... I'm sorry! How was it? I wonder why you can't make it. Lots of factories around, but... Aren't you hungry? What about you? Got a stomachache? I'm really hungry! Dad, 40 sen! RABIES PREVENTION DAY Bring stray dogs, and earn 40 sen a dog. BANSEIKAN INN Brother, nice cap, isn't it? We'll get a dog and buy one. With dogs it means you can get a meal. How much have you got? 6 sen. 1 sen. Where shall we go tomorrow? What about the Sunamachi area? Tomorrow you'll make it. That gateman was awful. Dad should've knocked him out. Tomorrow we'll make it. That gateman was bad. Dad should've knocked him out. You wait here. I bought this. Dad'll be angry. The dog meant a meal. I'll let you wear it, too. It suits you. He bought it with the dog. That was very foolish. Get dogs so we can eat. Aren't you hungry? You all right? Don't cry. What do you want to eat now? A big rice cake. Something more expensive? Rice with chicken and eggs. Anything will do. What about Dad? I want to drink. Water? Sake. No chance for a talk. BANSEIKAN INN We sure walked a long way. Shall we look for dogs tomorrow? No use trying at the factories. Can we stay here this evening? I've got no money. I shouldn't have bought this. We'll make it tomorrow. You asked them so politely, but... Don't blame the gatemen. What do you feel like eating? You want to drink again? Let's drink. Nice sake, isn't it? Some dried cuttlefish. More sake. You're happiest when you're drinking. Dad, use a bigger one. There's more. Drink up. Don't spill the precious sake. I threw the money away. Let it go! I feel wonderful. Want some rice? Get him some rice. Good? Pour tea over the rice. Excuse me. How do we get to Sarue? Kimiko! Children become friends quickly. You stayed at that inn last night? You've got no home, either? Isn't there a good job for me? I'm looking for one myself. It's hard on you, with your girl. But she's the one who keeps me going. Children are lovely. Do your best. I wish you good luck. I'll try that place. Come after me later, you two. You carry it. You carry it. You were told to do it. Then I'll leave it here. It's not my business! Not mine, either! I don't care. Me neither! Dad'll get mad. It's not my fault. Dad'll really get mad. Shall we stay at an inn without eating? Or shall we sleep here after eating? Which do you prefer? We'll eat and stay at an inn! Which is better? Eating! Food! It's started raining. We can't stay in the field. Why didn't it start raining earlier? We could've gone to an inn before eating. How much? 30 sen. Not enough? Why did you lose the bundle? Mind the cold. It's pouring. Isn't that Kihachi! Tsune! Long time no see. How have you been? Drop in at my place. Is this where you live? We just ate here. Thank you! I shouldn't have paid. You've grown, haven't you? Remember me? (And you are five now!) You still look young. So do you! How is your wife? She's gone. What happened? I don't know myself. What about that these days? I quit. Me, too! What are you doing now? As you can see. What are you going to do? Isn't there a job for me? Can't you help me? Shall I look for one? I won't ask for much. You'll be late for school. Noisy! Go to the factory! Wake up! Please take care of them. You haven't found a job yet? Not a chance for me. Don't give up so easily. I was in real trouble, too! But things went more smoothly than I thought. I hope it's the same with me. Have you eaten? I'll buy you some food. Then. Why don't you come, too? Just come with us. Will you give this child some food? That woman, too! And charge it to me! I go to school. What grade? Grade 4, Class 3. I'm sorry for all the troubles! Do you know that woman? She's looking for a job. Shall we play again in the field after school? I'll come home as soon as possible. Did she say anything about me? No, she didn't. Kimiko has a mother. That's very nice. You have a father! Having a mother is nice, too. That's asking too much! We'll play with her again tomorrow. We promised to play together every day. Welcome back! Eat it, the three of you! About a job, I asked my friend. We'll have to find one quickly. Tigers are stronger. Lions are stronger than tigers. The strongest is King Kong. Childhood is the best time of life. This may sound silly but I wish I were a child. We'll both start over. Don't make light of your life. 10 days ago, I would have died for good sake. I'm happy I'm still alive. What you are laughing at? For a woman aged 27 or 28 is this neckpiece too plain for her? Nice, isn't it? Here to boast of your woman? It's nice to live along. He's a good man, isn't he? You like him, don't you? What's wrong? Have you got a headache? What happened to her? She should've come by now. I wonder what happened to her. She didn't come today, either. Maybe she isn't here anymore. She should've said goodbye to us. She was a stranger after all. It's good to live long. For you! You've got the wrong person. I changed my mind. Everybody changes his mind nothing wrong with that. You work at a place like this? Then you didn't have to strain that much. I thought you were the type who'd live properly. It's unbelievable, eh? My kids were always waiting for you. Stop crying! You want to live an easy life, too, eh? I need money. My child is suffering from dysentery. I need money to send her to hospital. (I got no money so I had to use my body... ) I thought I was lost. I felt as if the end had come. I even thought of dying with her. I couldn't do anything for her. I wanted to act like a mother should. I didn't care what happened to me. I couldn't think of anything but my child. You're wrong! That sort of money would never save her. Go back to your daughter. You'll get money some other way. Hold her hand tightly. Whatever happens, don't give up. Tsune! Will you lend me 30 yen? Stop joking. You're asking the wrong person. Back to your old habits again? You still owe me money. I'll forget that. But I won't lend you any more. I'm sorry! Will you do me a favor? Will you take this to Kimiko's mother? I've found Kimiko and her mother. They're at the hospital. Don't drop it. Be careful! I hope she won't hate you. Behave while you're there. Didn't a workman-like fellow come? What brings you here? Be quiet! You've done something bad? What have you done? Will you do me a favor? Take care of my kids for a while. What on earth did you do? What did you do? You stole something? Why did you do that? I wanted to help somebody. Who? That woman's child. Why must you take care of that child? You can't even look after your children. What a stupid thing to do! But I couldn't just sit and watch. Once, I even considered killing myself and the kids. She's a woman. I couldn't stand to see her suffer. If you had kids... you'd understand. You wanted money for that? Why didn't you tell me? If you'd told me, I could have managed something. Why didn't you tell me? Don't say anything more. I'm sorry for all the troubles I've caused you! But will you take care of my kids? I'm imploring you! It's awful to be poor. I thought luck was beginning to side with you. And then this happened. The 10 days since you got me the job... have been the happiest time of my life. I'll go before my kids get back. Where's the nearest police station? Thus has a soul been saved.
