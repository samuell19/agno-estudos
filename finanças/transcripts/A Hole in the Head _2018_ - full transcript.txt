There's a thin line between truth and fiction. The same can be said for art and madness. But being fair is not an art. Thank you for watching this movie from a legal source. Bartek Topa. What's your name? What is your name? Hey! Name, surname. I don't understand, sorry. I don't understand. Will you let me sing? Will you? I'm not proud. I'm Italian. Italian. Yeah, yeah. If you're Italian, you might as well piss in the wind. Can I smoke a cigarette? Just one cigarette. Why did the detainee speak to the officers in Italian? I don't know Italian. A bit of Russian, but not Italian. You've mistaken me for someone else. I'm an actor. Please approach. We request that the court not apply a preventive measure in the form of remand. The detainee's mother is gravely ill and needs to be taken care of. Here are two telegrams. It's an urgent matter. We've attached documents signed by his fellow actors vouching for him. Until the trial the detainee is to report to the police station at his mother's place of residence. Does the detainee understand? Do we know each other? I don't think so. Sorry, I didn't mean to... I'm sorry. Radio Racyja is on the air and here we start. Today we reflect on the passing year. They're cutting down old trees. It was different for each of us but-- What are those birdies? Adam -What? -Adam's birdie. Adam can imitate a birdie? -Yeah. -Well, well. Adam has a singing birdie. Did you say something? Who are you talking to? Are you talking to yourself or to us? Do you like walking in someone's footprints in the snow? You like walking in someone's footprints in the snow? -It's like following someone's life. -Yeah, I like it. -Right? -What? When you walk in someone's footprints in the snow, it's like you're following their life. Whose footprints? Fuck. -I don't know what you mean. -I mean... in the snow, when you're walking in someone's footprints... -You're asking if I like to do it? -Yeah. -I do. -How about you? Yeah, cause it covers my tracks. But why would I walk in someone's footprints? I don't get it. 'Cause sometimes... So they can't track you. How was the shortcut? Bumpy. Mr. Bogdan. What? Here? In this musty dump? I knew it would come to this. Distinguished fucking actor. I wouldn't even step foot in here to take a piss... and they expect me to perform here? It's as if you hadn't known we were coming today. Desolation. Complete lack of culture. Desolation. Once, I had an old turtle. It always crawled towards the lamp. A young actor and he can't even find his light. What is this? Should I fill this out? We need it for accounting. Lend me a pen. See you tomorrow. You must be joking. Well... it's the best we could arrange. Fuck this, I'm leaving. My toiletry bag. -You only wanted the nail file. -I'm to sleep in a broom closet? He's not there. You can sleep with me and Klara. Always the same. Always the same. He's a bit... I think I want to get out. -I want to get out. -Stay. We're on a field trip. The fun has just begun. And they expect me to perform here? Once more, hold on. And they expect me to perform here? Shit. What? Desolation. Shit. Careful or you'll burst a vein. The tunnel was tight. The walls pressed against my face. I couldn't turn around. They were rough, unhewn wood... and I thought: "What? Wooden walls? In Heaven?" Then I thought they'd buried me alive in a casket. I started screaming... and I realized I was dying. This is death, this is the end. I started... crawling. Down the tunnel towards the light. That light, that bright point, it was... pure radiance. I felt like that radiance knew my entire life. Then images appeared... or were they memories 'cause... they were from my life. The first from when I was three, walking with my dad to the meadows... where the hemp grew. We'd go into the bushes, and Father... would pick out the seeds. The goldfinches were jabbering. It was as if the person I was looking at... was someone else. Like in a cinema. But it was me. Pretentious bullshit. When I watched the images... I didn't see the radiance, but I felt its presence. When the images vanished... all this had lasted a second, maybe less... I opened my eyes. In the hole behind the sun gleamed a steel chain. At the end of which stood a dog. It was looking at me. A dog? I walked drunkenly into the doghouse. The dog stayed outside. I'm quitting smoking. It wasn't far from here, about 19 miles. Got a tissue? Mother's here. Mother is here. Mother is here. She's there. There, there. I don't see her. There's mother. There. Oh yes, you... -Wise guy. -Quiet. Excellent soup. Quite excellent... noodle soup. Do sit down, everybody. Sit down. Why are you standing there? What are you waiting for? Eat the soup, or he'll fuck you up. What? Is it too salty? The fact is there's nothing here, but slaughterhouses, churches, and fascists. Wherever we go there is envy... small-mindedness... xenophobia... hatred of art. Nowhere else is art received with the same obtuseness. Art, art. Fucking art! Here they do not even know what that is. A true artist is dragged down into the mire. Show them? They don't see it. Tell them? They don't hear it. Art, art. Ski jumping. -Like in Wisła. -Like Małysz. Wherever you go here, you end up in a shithole. Whoever you meet... they will always be a moron! What's going on? We underestimate their stupidity. We think that if we understand, they will too! But they don't, at all! Stop it. Art, art. Will you calm down? Say it to my face. You oaf. Or sit on your ass and shut your trap. I'm talking to you, oaf. You're the oaf. What did you say? What are you doing? This is supposed to be culture? This is a theatre! Get out. Hey! Leave the boy alone. Calm down. What are you smiling at? No... -You're smiling. -Are you mad? We're leaving. Stop it. Let's go. You turned the lights off? Turn them on! They turned off the lights, so I wouldn't act. Carrying out the fucking mission of art in firehouses and community centers, like whores without a school. In broom closets. This is it, no more. This is the last tour. You owe me for four shows, plus the two we won't perform. Acting like an oaf among bumpkins requires real skill. Go home, you cock, and get ahold of yourself before you deal with other people. Open up. Open the door. Hey. What the fu-- ...from the beginning of 1830 performed solo successfully in different Belarusian cities. He also gained popularity abroad. By count Tyszkiewicz invitation, he worked as a music teacher at Raudondvaris Castle. At the same time, he was a conductor of a symphony orchestra which became famous in Europe. In 1862 Miladovsky emigrated to France where he lived till his death. That's it for me. The last week overview was prepared by Uladzimir Hilmanovitsch. Stay with Belarusian Radio Racyja.

You didn't pick up the phone. Eleven years. No. -Really? -Yeah. Really. My darling. Can I speak with her? But she can only listen. Who is that? That's Andrew.

We just talked to the ambassador of Human Rights Centre Viasna. ...diplomatic words. Seems like it's high time for Belarusian policy to get some specific notion for diplomatic words. They mean something. He doesn't know what's happening. But you won't let him be. You'll... give him back, yeah? I won't stay here. He'll inherit the house. Didn't they teach you to knock? Maybe you can jingle. I'll make you wear a bell. How is your brother? -Brother? -Brother. The one who came back. Good. He said he will shoot all of you. He has the gun leftover from the war. And you won't do a damn thing about it. You made yourself a copy? Huh? That he's me? That I'm supposed to be him? You hear? You're pretending as usual. I caught you with your eyes open. You're pretending. Unconscious with her eyes open. You have to hear something. You hear? I wouldn't be here if I didn't have to. A second son? You found a moron clone? Dummy mother, dummy son. Now you've done it. Come on. Come here. I'll teach you. I'll wipe that smile off your face. Complete lack of culture. Desolation. What? Where'd you hear that? Smell that. You know what that is? A doe's foot. How do you know that line? How do you know that line?! I don't know. He's parodying me. The same movements. I don't know. Where'd it come from? The Bernhardt? The matchstick? He couldn't have known that. Let it go. I don't know. Maybe it's a coincidence. Or maybe he just repeats what he hears. He won't fool me. I know when someone's acting. Dammit. I think... your mother is done for. Don’t cry Oh my heart Will break When I go My way Good bye, my love. Good bye. I always will be true. So hold me in your dreams 'til I come back to you. Good bye-- What's going on? Get up. Get up! Left pant leg, wet in the same spot. How is that even possible? You're crazy. Sick. Are you not seeing this on purpose? This is ridiculous. Take off your pants. Take them off! Leave him be. -Leave him alone. -Let me go. Is there a water tube? Huh? How did you do it? Open. She's searching for air. Open, open. It's cold. You were sleeping. Oh my God. Hold her. Hold her down. I'm already-- Lay her down. I'm dying! Dying. Dying. Good old lightbulbs, prohibited in the European Union. Go to the UK for work. Go to Belarus for Freedom. There is no reason for you to come here anymore. But that bench will always be waiting for you. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Create all by the depth of wisdom! How did you find me? I'm dead. Give me a cigarette. He had not time to say "alack," before the bear was on his back. How are you feeling? How are you feeling? Is everything okay? It's not funny. Stop fooling around. Do you hear? You hear? Subtitle translation by Anna Piotrowska
