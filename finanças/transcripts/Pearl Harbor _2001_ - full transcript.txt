German bandits at two o'clock! Increase throttle! Power dive! Spell it right, Rafe. "Rudder" is spelled with two Ds. - Thanks, wingman. - Yeah, sure. Whoa, bandits! Crack shootin', Danny. Crack shootin', Rafe. - Land of the free. - Home of the brave. Great flyin',Dad! Come on. I'm gonna teach you how to fly. I get the front! No, you take the back. I'm bigger, and I should be in front. I'm older, and I'm teachin', so no. Wow. It's like we're really flying. Yeah, I did it lots of times. Come on, you man the guns. I'll give her some throttle. We gotta get those dirty German bandits. Oh, gosh! - Hang on! - Make it stop, Rafe! I've seen my dad do this lots of times. Don't worry! Rafe! Oh, my gosh! We're flying! We're flying! Whoa! Uhh! Wow. My dad's gonna kill me. Come on. Yes! Whoo-hoo! We flew! We flew! Yes! I'm a pilot! - I know! - Yeah! We flew. - You no-account boy! - Daddy- I done told you, you spend time playing... with this stupid boy can't read... you ain't never goin' to amount to nothin'! He ain't stupid, Daddy! Daddy! Ohh! Come on! Uhh! Get on back home. Now! Get on up. You got work to do. Come on! Come on, get on home! Uhh! You let him alone! Daddy, no! I will bust you open, you dirty German! What'd you call me? I fought the Germans in France. And I fought 'em in the trenches. And I pray to God no one ever has to see... the things that I saw. You're my bestfriend. Daddy, wait! Daddy, wait. Adolf Hitler... builds the German military machine... and drags all of Europe into war. But even while France falls to Hitler... America still refuses to join the fighting. - Where's McCawley and Walker? - Still training, sir. Alright, Danny. Now let's show 'em how to fly. We're gonna play chicken. You ready? This ain't the farm, and these ain't no cropdusters. I'm not playing chicken with you. Now don't be a baby. I'll tell you what- - I'm not doing it, Rafe. - Well, I'm coming right at you. You can turn, or you can hit me. It's up to you. What the- Oh, boy. Why you always bustin' my ass, Rafe? Which way you goin'? I guess I'll go right. No, uh, left. I'll go left. OK, we're goin' left, right? Ri-uh, right. Right? Right like we're goin' right, or right like we're goin' left? Well, now you got me all mixed up! I don't know. Make up your mind. God, Rafe, we're going right! Righty-tighty! Aah! - Whoo-hoo! - Whoo-hoo-hoo! Those are some smooth aces. Did you say something? 'Cause let me tell ya, those farm boys are grounded! Yes, sir, an entirely unacceptable use... of m-m-military aircraft, sir. - Get my hat. - Yes, sir. Get those hedge-hoppers in Doolittle's office. After two years of training... you believe that a $45,000 airplane... is there for your amusement? No, sir. I was just trying... to keep my edge, Major. And when you did the outside loop last week... what did you think that was? Honing your skills? That's not training, McCawley. That's a stunt. And I personally consider it to be reckless... and irresponsible. Major... How could that be, when you're famous... for being the first man in the world ever to do it? Don't get cute with me, son. No, sir, I don't mean to be disrespectful. I just think that- well, I- It is reckless and irresponsible... if you're just doing it to be a show-off. But I was doing it to try to inspire the men, sir... in the way that you've inspired me. I believe the French even have a word for that... when the men get together to honor their leaders. They call it an homage, sir. - A what? - An homage, sir. That's bullshit, McCawley! But it's very, very good bullshit. Thank you, sir. McCawley, you remind me of myself fifteen years ago. Which is why we need to discuss this. Have a seat, son. The British have accepted you into the Eagle Squadron. You're on your way to England tomorrow... if you still want to go. Huh. Wow. Just a few British pilots are all that stand... between Hitler and total victory in Europe. They're gonna need all the help they can get. Yes, sir. Well, I'm on my way. Just for the record... I'm supposed to ask you to reconsider. Sir? Sooner or later we're gonna be in this war... whether we like it or not. And I'm gonna need all of my best pilots. So it's my duty to ask you to stay. Major, what would you do? If it was me... I'd go. Get out. Am I going bald right back here? Ooh! Man, I am one good-lookin' son of a bitch. Don't you ever die. Die. That's exactly... the concept you gotta work tonight. You put a drop of this clove oil under your eyes... and you let 'em sting and well up. You get your nurse alone, take a breath... let her see your eyes glisten... and say, "Baby, they're training me for war... "and I don't know what'll happen... "but if I die tomorrow, I want to know... "that we lived all we could tonight. " Come on, guys! We got nurses waitin'. Come on, before the rest of his hair falls out. How could you do this? Well, Doolittle assigned me. He wanted me to get some real- real combat training in. Well, guess what? It's not training over there. It's war. Where the losers die, and there aren't any winners- just guys who turn into broken-down wrecks... like my father. Yeah, I understand that, Danny. But I feel like I got a duty to go. Don't preach to me about duty, damn it. I wear the same uniform you do. Now, if trouble wants me, I'm ready for it. But why go looking for it? God, Danny, come on. I'm gonna be twenty-five. I might as well be an old man. They're gonna have me bein' a flight instructor. I don't wanna teach loops and barrel rolls. I wanna be a combat fighter. Hey, come on! The nurses can't d- d-dance by themselves. Let's go. If the call of duty means seeing 150 men... in their underwear every day... we are here to serve. I can't believe it. Saturday night in New York City. Do you know what they're doing where I come from? Nothing. Cow-tipping. Well, that's why you joined the Navy, hon'. To get out of that dusty little town and see the world. May I remind you, Barbara, we're Navy nurses, not tourists. I joined to do my patriotic duty and... to meet guys. Me, too. Girls, we're gonna have so much fun tonight in the city. You've gotta tell them the story, Evelyn. What? Oh, come on. Tell us. Oh, it's such a long story. We got time. I saw it happen. Well, it was about four weeks ago... What do you think is b-b-better? All in the one cheek, or spreading them out? OK. Fusco, Anthony. You all right, buddy? Sweetie, do you really have to do this? I'm not gonna get yellow fever in my barracks. No? If you'd rather, she can do it. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Just gimme a minute. Honey, the government says stick 'em, we stick 'em. Uh! Hey, Red, you alright? Eye exam number four? Listen, Doc, I have passed a dozen medical checks. You write that, they won't let me fly. Sorry, son. I'm gonna fail. They're gonna take my wings away. No, they won't. Just relax. Read the bottom line, please. Just keep practicin' the bottom line. And don't worry. I'm right behind you. J- L-M-K-P-O- Next. Ma'am. J- L-M-K-P-O-E-T-X. Eyes like an eagle, ma'am. Slow down, flyboy. And, instead of the bottom, read the very top. Both eyes. Yeah. "C"- sorry, "J." Ahem. "C"... - "W." - "W." - "Q." - Uh, "Q." Uh, "'Q."' Read the bottom line again, please. But read it right to left and every other letter. "E." Heh. "'X."' - X-E. - X-E. X- E, ma'am. Ma'am, I know how this looks. I'm sorry, Lieutenant, I really am. But Army and Navy requires 20/20 vision. Oh, i-it's-it's not a problem with my eyes. I mean, I can see. I mean, I can hit a running rabbit with a $3.00 pistol. I got a problem with letters, that's all. Well, maybe after some schooling... you could come back and take the test again. No, I had schooling. I mean, I-the teachers just never knew... what to make of it. It's just letters. I mix 'em up sometimes. That's all. I mean, I just get 'em backward sometimes. L- look here. Uh, my-my math and-and spacial reasoning... and my verbal scores are all excellent. But you barely passed the written exam. Yeah, but he did pass it. So, is it my turn now? - No, you'll wait your turn. - Yes, ma'am. Ma'am, I-I'm never gonna be an English teacher. But I know why I'm here. To be a pilot. And you don't dogfight with manuals. You don't fly with gauges. I mean, it's all about feeling and speed... and lettin' that plane become like a part... of your body. And that manual... says that a guy who's a slow reader can't be a good pilot. That file says I'm the best pilot in this room. Ma'am, please, don't take my wings. Well, I felt so bad. Evelyn, rotate to station three. I had no choice. I passed him. - Good. - Uh-huh. So, then this cocky pilot comes back. - Say, fella, are you enlisted? - Yeah. "Yeah"? Boy, you're talking to an officer. Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. - Give me that file. - Yes, sir. - Parade rest. - Yes, sir. Ma'am, I didn't get a chance to thank you. Drop your skivvies. Ah, oh, OK. Just like this? That's fine. He did have a very cute butt. You know, I know you didn't have to pass me... and you did. And I just- I didn't think you'd understand, and you did. You know, you still haven't said thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. Why'd you do it? I mean, I'm just curious. You're like my hero now. Actually, my father was a pilot. And, um, I've seen first-hand what happens... when a pilot loses his wings. You know what? Your father's my hero, then, too. Infact, as an officer, I think it'd by my duty... to take my new hero's daughter out tonight... Just to-aah! Gosh, did I poke too deep? I think you hit the bone there. You are so mean. What? So is- is there any chance... that you might, kind of, sort of... you know, like me, or... Oh, how did you guess? They never taught us... how to deal with this... feeling. Wh-what feeling? Well, it's kind of like... this. Ow! Well, he was getting fresh, so I poked him again. All right, Romeo. I want to get this over with. Hold on a second. Miss... I really, really lick you. What did he mean? Like you. I didn't mean to say that. And I just, um... I just want to ask you, please, if I can donate dinner. He started to act very strange. Or, well, buy you dinner. This isn't your chart. Whoa. No. That's the, uh, this, uh, fellow over here's. I think he left. Have you already had this shot? Yeah, well, once... already. Well, I wanted- I mean, can I ask you out? No! And he just went wham! Unh! Oh! What'd you do to him? Poor guy. Hey! Oh, my God. Are you OK? Uh, yeah. I'm fine. I feel great. This is just standard precautionary... thing. Look, I got some, uh, genuine French champagne... from France. I thought, you know, maybe we could celebrate. Celebrate what? Oh, I don't know. Uh, well, you being my hero, for one. OK. Why not? So, uh, ahem... I wanted to thank you. And I just wanted to, uh... put your mind at ease about passing me... because I really do think you did this country a service. I mean, I'm- I am a great flier. And if you have a fault, which you obviously don't... it's modesty. No. If I have a fault, it's candor. You are just so- Uhh. Cork just got away from me. God, oh, it hurts. It hurts something fierce. I'm sorry. - Ohh... - Oh, it's bleeding. - God. - Oh! - Ohh! - Lay still. I ruined everything. - Lay still. - Oh, it hurts. - Ow! It's cold. - It'll stop the bleeding. Yeah. I can't breathe. Lay still. You are so beautiful it hurts. It's your nose that hurts. No. I think it's my heart. And then I kissed him. Oh, Evelyn. That's the most romantic story I ever heard. It's been the most romantic four weeks and two days of my life. Oh, I'm so jealous. Hello, Lieutenant. - It's good to see you. - You, too, Lieutenant. Pick a hand. It's beautiful. What's in your other hand? Mine. Well, it took me six hours to fold these. Oh! I want you to meet my friends. Rafe, this is Martha, Barbara, Sandra- - Hi. I'm Betty. - Hi. Would you happen to have any friends? Huh. Take your pick. Hi. Whoo! We ever get in this war and somethin' happens to me... I can't tell you how good it makes me feel to know... that someone as sweet as you will be there... to nurse me back to health. Good, but we're not in the war yet. - Ahem. - OK. That was a bad line. Hi. I'm-I'm Red. Red- S- s-s-s-strange. Heh heh. Your last name's Strange? Yeah. She's all yours, soldier. No. It-it's Winkle. Red is such a ladies' man. Do you always stutter? No. Only when I'm- She's totally buying it. - Nervous? - Yeah. Why can't I get something like that? Hello. Hi. Danny seems kind of shy around the girls. Tsk. It's not that he's shy. He's just, ahem... a little unsure of himself, you know. His old man used to run him down a lot. Get him in a plane, he's sure of himself. He's like my brother. He's like my best friend. He's my right hand. Which at the moment is a long way south of my waist. Oh, I'm sorry. I guess I lost a little altitude. Yeah, I guess you did. Excuse me. You and me, we got to talk. So, the rumor is the Navy's shipping us to Pearl Harbor. Well, won't be so bad. It's about as far from the fighting as you can get. You'll get a sun tan. So maybe the Army'll post you guys there, too. You... are a super special woman. And, and, well... Well, they're- they're training me... to be a big bad warrior, and, well... So, I mean, you never know what might happen tomorrow... or... or any day after that, you know? So... God, we need to make tonight super special. Why are you crying? I guess it's the thought... that I might not ever get to see you again. Dry your eyes, toots. Tonight, you're mine. I don't want to be with a crowd tonight. I just want to be alone with you. Well... How does New York Harbor by moonlight sound? Ohh! Heh heh! Are you gonna be a bad influence? Of course I'm a bad influence. Let's see if we can commandeer this vessel... 'cause we're, uh, officers of the U.S. Government. Not for long, we won't be. One day, we'll take a trip on a boat like that. Would you like that? We'll be dressing for cocktails and walk into the grandsalon. No one's talking about war. They're just dancing to Cole Porter. - I'll have to get a tux. - Yeah. Come on. There you go. All aboard. - You're out of your mind. - Oh, yeah. Careful now. Here, sit down. Now let's see here. Ah! There we go. See, this is as close as I could get you to your ship. So, at least I tried, right? Actually, you know what? This is better. Yeah, it is. God, you're pretty. What's gonna become of us all, Rafe? Well, the future's not exactly in our hands, is it? No. I guess you're right. - Aah! - Aah! Oh, my God! Are you all right? Yeah, are you? That was not part of the date. Watch your step. Oh, thank you. Evelyn! Guys, come up! Come on up! Come up! We're in 321. There's something I got to tell you. Well, you got no secrets from me, Lieutenant. I've seen your medical chart. Here we go. This can't be good, or it wouldn't be so hard to say. Yep. I got to go away. We're all going away. Yeah... but I'm going to the war... tomorrow. I'm flying with the Eagle Squadron. It's an outfit the British started for American pilots. I don't understand. You're in the U.S. Army. How could they order you to go? They didn't order me. I volunteered. Huh. But I passed you. I let you through. And now you volunteer... for the most dangerous place you could go? It's not your responsibility, not your choice. Flying's the only thing I ever wanted to do. I mean, everything in my life has led me up to this point. Meeting you. I love you. I love you so much. Let's go inside. All right. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just-I-I can't do this. This just-it's not right. I'm sorry. I just- See, I can't do this. I mean, I mean, I can. I- I want to. I'm not trying to be noble, you know. Or not saying I know what would happen... or just- I need to stop talking. I just-I just don't want- I just don't want it to be like everybody else. I don't want you to have anything about tonight... that you regret. I mean, it's been the most incredible night of my life... and I don't want to ruin that. Oh, you couldn't ruin it. If I had one more night to live, I'd want to spend it with you. See, that's what I want to come home to. That's what I want to have to think about and dream about. I want to know that the best part of my life... is still ahead of me. Look. Don't, um... could you... not come see me off? Because, uh... saying good-bye to you once is hard enough. Here. Take this. Why? You think it looks good on me? I will come back. I thought you said you told her not to come. Yeah, I did. Why you looking for her then? It's my test. If I tell her not to come, and she comes anyway... then I-I know she loves me. All aboard! Track 57! If, uh, anything happens to me... I want you to be the one to tell her. All right? You just make sure and come back for the both of us, all right? OK. See you when I get back. Yeah. Good hunting, Rafe. Evelyn! Evelyn! Evelyn! Evelyn! Evelyn. Hey! She loves me. The German Luftwaffe... relentlessly bombards downtown London... while Churchill's Royal Air Force... is in a deadly struggle... to maintain control of the British skies. This is a real mess. Lieutenant McCawley reporting for duty, sir. Good. We'll get you settled into your quarters. And then introduce you to the crate you'll be flying. If y'all are patching up bullet holes here... maybe we ought to skip housekeeping... and get me in an airplane. Two didn't come back, sir. We counted only eleven. Are all Yanks as anxious as you... to get themselves killed, Pilot Officer? Not anxious to die, sir. Just anxious to matter. This is yours. Good chap. Didn't die till he'd landed and shut down his engine. Please be seated, gentlemen. I'm afraid I'm in a bad mood. Churchill and Stalin are asking me what I'm asking you. How long is America going to pretend... the world is not at war? We've increased food and oil shipments, Mr. President... and as far as I know- What they really need are tanks, planes... bullets, bombs, and men to fight. But our people think Hitler and his Nazi thugs... are Europe's problem. We have to do more. Send the Brits and Russians more of our ships... and anti-aircraft weapons. And keep cannibalizing the Pacific Fleet? What choice do we have? We're building refrigerators while our enemies build bombs. This is so exciting. You know there's about one hundred ships on Pearl. How many sailors per ship? It depends. More on a battleship than a sub. But say, on average... 2,000? Then there's the flyers, the marines, base personnel. I'm still working on the sailors. Girls, I think the odds are in your favor. Yeah, like 4,000 to one. It's paradise. See you on the beach, boys! We're in Hawaii! Hey! You're not supposed to paint titties... on the side of my airplanes. And if you do, don't make 'em lopsided. They were lopsided, Earl. Look, it says right here. "Never ride waves amongst rocks or submerged pilings. " See, it says you shouldn't do that. How do you know they're submerged if they're submerged? Gooz, what in the hell are you doing? Just trying to fix this surfboard thing. He keeps taking chunks off his nose on the rocks. On my day off, I'm working on my new invention- the Gooz Cruise Fin. I'm gonna be a rich fella. Every surfboard in the nation's gonna need one. Yeah? Well, you're gonna need a broom. Check out these new recruits. Hi. Aloha. Y'all pilots? We're working on it. It's a lot of switches and stuff. Pride of the Pacific. Who are you? Terrors of the skies. Welcome, ladies. Hi. I have to deal with toasty sun burnt fanny... before I can show you around. Ow! Dear Evelyn. It's different than I thought it would be here. It's cold- so cold it goes deep into your bones. There is one place I can go to find warmth. That is to think of you. I just wish I could be back there with you. It's not easy making friends. Two days ago, I had a beer... with a couple of the RAF pilots. Yesterday, both of them got killed. Dear Rafe. I miss you so much. It's so strange to be half a world away from you. I'm right on his tail! Got one! Every night I look at the sunset... and try to draw the last ounce of heat from its long day... and send it from my heart to yours. Family? Girl, sir. The girl. A lot of people frown on the Yanks... for not being in this war yet. I'd just like to say... if there are many more back home like you... God help anyone who goes to war with America. Atten-hut! Attention on deck! Admiral Kimmel... Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Fleet, on deck. Sharp presentation, Captain. Thank you, Admiral Kimmel. For four months now Washington's been blowing pink smoke... about the threat from Japan. Could make us lose our fighting edge. I'm determined not to let that happen. With your permission, Captain. Admiral, urgent, from Washington. I'm supposed to keep this fleet... battle-ready to take on the Japanese... cover half the damn globe. Now they want me to transfer... another twelve destroyers to the Atlantic. Don't they know what we're facing out here? They feel Europe is the greater danger. I'm assuming these risk assessments include Hawaii? Pearl Harbor is too shallow for an aerial torpedo attack. We're surrounded by sub nets. All we need worry about is sabotage... so we bunched our planes together... to make them easier to protect. Distance is our ally, Admiral. You analysts got it all figured out, don't you? The smart enemy hits you... exactly where you think you're safe. Incoming! I fixed the hydraulics and electrics, sir... but the oil hoses still need attention. Just crank it, Ian! God speed you, sir. Red section, take the bombers. Blue section, look out for the fighters. Bombers dead ahead. Let's drop in and give 'em a reception. Red Two, follow my lead, high side. Go right at the lead bomber. Following you, Red One. Good hit! Good hit! Red One, coming around, reset for the kill. I have the middle bomber. Hammer down! We got him. Nice shot, Red Two. I got two M.E.s dead ahead. I'm on him. I'm on his tail. Hammer down. I got one of them! I got another one. Red One, you got fighters all over your tail! I'm under fire! I'm taking fire! Red One, get out of there. Pull up! Pull up! Argh! I got an oil leak. Can't see a damn thing! I can't bail! My canopy's stuck! I can't bail out! He's on my tail, Red Two. I'm hit! I'm hit! Mayday! Mayday! Oh, my God. I'm no good at church. What do you mean, sweetie? When I'm up there getting my slate wiped clean... I'm thinking how to dirty it up again. Wow, this from a virgin! I got to inventory supplies. Kill me now. Could you be any more boring? Don't bother. Sunday, she writes Rafe... ten pages instead of the usual five. Gosh, I wish I was in love. Hey, sweetheart. She hates me. Good to see you, Red. Good to see you, too, Betty. You wanna come for a ride? Come on. Yeah, I'll be your chauffeur. That-a-boy! Be a mad dog! You hit pretty hard... for a cook. All right, Walker, who you got? I'll take the cook. Why? You don't like money? Come on! Get out there now! - I'll put five on it. - Done. Against a mechanic? That guy craps rivets. How's it feel up from the engine room? Sunlight botherin' you? Ow. Man, he's getting all busted up! Move! Move! Come here, we gotta talk. Get down here. He can't hurt us. He can hurt us. - He cut us. We bleeding. - Bleeding? That's a scratch. See this? This is the hard-earned greenbacks... of every pot-scrubbin' chop in this fleet. Now if we don't win... Teeny here has to find another battleship! I'm not going back to the Arizona empty-handed. Don't worry about the money. I'll send that smug engine-fixin' snipe... back below decks where he belong. We the man! He slapped your mama! Be a son of a bitch! Look at this! All right, Dorie! That's enough. That's enough. - Oh! Where's my money? - Nah, fight's rigged. We're rich! Ha ha ha! How'd you get this? Boxing. Did you win? Yes, ma'am. What do you get for winning? Respect. So, why do you have to fight with your fists to get respect? I left my momma in Texas... and joined the Navy to see the world... become a man. They made me a cook. Not even that. I clean up after other sailors eat. Two years, they never even let me fire a weapon. Well, let's hope you never have to. Yes, ma'am. You take care, Petty Officer Miller. You, too, ma'am. You know, he taught me to fly. I always knew that no matter what trouble I got into... I'd never be in it alone. He'd be there with me. He was always pushing me to be better and faster. He told me you were a great flier. It was the same night he told me... he'd volunteered to go to England. Volunteered? He... he told me he'd been assigned. He was always trying to protect me. But you know what? I look at myself in the mirror in this uniform... and I still don't know who I am. I look like a hero... but I don't feel like it. Rafe... he always looked the part, didn't he? He couldn't wait to be one. To Rafe McCawley. The best pilot... and the best friend I ever knew... or ever will know. To Rafe. THUR Look at this. The Japanese... are flooding the Pacific with radio traffic. Everywhere from the Panama Canal to southeast Asia. There's no logical pattern, Captain. No. There's always logic. They know we read their mail. They're trying to make us think their fleet is moving south. I'm not buying it. Something, something's up. Otherwise, why would they take the trouble to bullshit me? Evelyn, I signed for these letters for you today. They're from England. They're from Rafe. I'm sorry, Ev. You know how long it takes mail to get here. Hurry up! Show time, boys! Come on! America still awaits Japan's response... to peace proposals. Ambassador Nomura arrives in Washington... in what could hopefully guarantee... continued peace in the Pacific. On the British front, Churchill declares... "Give us the tools, and we will finish the job. " The RAF has fought bravely against... Hitler's ambition to rule the skies over the Channel. Victory does not come without sacrifice. Evelyn! - Danny. - Hey. Some comedy, huh? Yeah. It's been a while. I've been logging a lot of flight hours. I kinda been avoiding you, too. Yeah. - Look- - Do you- Do you want to? Sure, yeah. I remember one time when I was... like, seven years old... I was always building gadgets and things. He wanted me to build him some wings... so he could fly like his daddy. I told him you can't fly without some kind of engine. But he wouldn't listen. "Danny, never mind that, just build 'em anyway. " So I did. And I'm up there... strapping these big ol' wings on his back... that we made from paper and glue... and these massive silk bloomers that we stole. He looked so stupid, and I told him... "You can't jump off the barn in these. " And bam! He busted his leg on a backhoe. God, I miss him. Yeah. But don't you think... that Rafe wasn't back up there next day. Cast and everything... telling me to make some adjustments on those wings. Check this out! Crossroads of the Pacific. Tahiti-1,700 miles! All right! Say, Betty... W- wou... - No, Betty! Get up! - What's going on, Red? - Stand up, please. - What do you mean? Just stand up. Stand... Oh! Ha! Betty... Red, come on! We got a dinner reservation. Can I get a minute? What's the matter, you sick? Can a guy propose?! Oh! Thank you! Am I talking too much? Sometimes I do that, I'm sorry. Hold up! Look at this. Hello! OK, let's get out of here. OK. I guess I should go. Don't let it be three months before I see you again. I had a good time. Yeah, me, too. Do you want me to walk you home? No, I'll be fine. No... of course. - Good night. - Good night. I was just wondering if maybe I could come by some time... get a cup of coffee or a piece of pie? What am I doing? OK. Oh! You were asleep. I'm sorry. Danny? Is something wrong? No! Nothing's wrong. No problem. Hi! It's just Danny. I... just... you... you forgot this. Oh... thanks. It was good of you to take the trouble... to drop it over... now. I... well, I thought you might need it. You know... maybe tomorrow morning. If... not that you wear this to work, but... No... it's a hankie. Right, right. Yeah. Listen, I was thinking maybe... I could come by some time... if I gave you a call, could I come by? Once, maybe... if you're not busy? Yeah, maybe. - Maybe? - Maybe. OK, all right. Thanks. Good-bye. Good night. You are such an idiot! Did you have fun last night? It wasn't how it looked. And if it was, it'd be all right. It's been months. It's time to move on. I am moving on. Ev, don't lie. All I know is, I hear you crying when you think I'm asleep. When my dad left... I was too much for my mom to handle... so she sent me to live with my aunt. I thought my life was over... But you don't know where it's all gonna lead. If I hadn't run away and lied about my age... and enlisted in the Navy... I wouldn't have met Red, and... now he's my fiance. Oh, God, I can't get used to that word. - It's only been twelve hours. - Oh, Betty! Little Betty beat us all to the post. And this is ward three. As you can see, no patients. Welcome to Hawaii. Come on, I'll show you the bar. Sandra, new recruits to torture. Come on. Excuse me, ladies? Hi! We're gonna wait two years until I'm nineteen... and Red can buy me a ring. Rafe sent his best friend to tell you... so you would be OK, so you can move on. You gotta go on living, Ev. Red! Whoo! Sorry! Bye, Rafe. The Japanese Fleet is missing. They're operating under radio silence. This footage was shot four days ago on October 28th. We're sending scout planes in wider vectors... all over the Pacific, but they get nothing. They could be anywhere in here. I don't understand how two whole carrier divisions... can just disappear. Clear! Aw, we're all over the page. We got one wall-eyed and one pigeon-toed. Anthony, tap in number six. All right. Gooz, tap in number three. All right. Hey. We got a visitor. Oh... that ain't no Navy issue uniform, eh? Danny, it's Evelyn. Jesus! You alright? Yeah. Yeah. No. I think I'm fallin' for her. Wow. You know, I saw this coming. I didn't want this to happen. It just kind of did. Can't help it. Well, Danny, she's gotta be with somebody. It might as well be you. You telling me if you were dead... and you saw your best buddy doin' your girl... you wouldn't come back and beat the living crap outta him? - Tony, back off. - I'd be back so fast. Danny's being a better friend taking care of her himself. I got a girlfriend. That's great. Come on, fellas. Let's split. Danny, whatever happens now is just about you and her. You gotta try and forget about Rafe. Be careful, alright? Ladies... cloud the mind. - Thanks, Gooz. - You're welcome. Hey, Danny. Where's everybody going? Just bein' discreet. Does it seem like everybody's acting a little strange? No. Nah. Right. Well, maybe-maybe a little. Yeah. Well, people in this outfit... have way too much time on their hands. Oh, yeah. I just hope they don't think there's been something... goin' on between us, that's all. Oh, no. I mean, no. That would be... embarrassing, right? Forgot my wrenches. That would definitely be embarrassing. Yeah. Ha. Forgot my wrenches. Hey. He really doesn't have to leave. No. I, uh, I'm just goin' out with the girls, so... I guess I'll see you later. - Yeah. - All right. Yeah, all right. I'll see you around. Shit. Evelyn. Have you ever seen Pearl Harbor at sunset? Of course. Well... from the air? You know, I could get kicked out of the military for this. - Really? - Yeah. Stay down. The Hawaiians called this harbor Wai Momi. It means "water of pearls. " It's so beautiful. My dad took me up a couple of times. Just don't do what he did. What do you call it when you flip over? A barrelroll? Yeah. I won't. Aah! - Oh! - Ha ha ha ha! - Oh, God. - What do you think? I like that. Hey! That plane was supposed to be back here an hour ago! Quick, hide in the parachute hangar. My heart is pounding. Danny, last night... No, that's terrible. Danny, we need to talk about this. Sir. Evelyn! - Danny. - Hey. Hi. Hi. I didn't sleep a wink last night. I had to see you. Last night was crazy, I know, but... I'm not sorry. Are you? I don't know. Danny, I had a wonderful time last night. I- It's just all too fast. Listen, Evelyn, I was just down at the beach this morning... and I watched the sun rise... and I knew that everything was gonna be different. That this was the start of something new. In this place, in this moment. And I don't care what anybody else says, you know? How can I not feel this way? I kinda like you. Oh, you do? You have your tie on crooked. Everything's gonna be all right, OK? Everything's gonna be all right. Do you have any airtours going through the valley of Oahu? You do? Aloha. This is KGMB in Honolulu... on another beautiful fall day here in paradise. We have enough information. We are returning home. Do you ever wonder... if this war's gonna catch up with us? Nota whole lot. Every moment we're not together, you're up there training for it. Yeah, well, I'm training for moments like these... 'cause I have no idea... how I'm gonna get this car out of the sand. Evelyn, can you please come out of the bathroom? You've been there for an hour. Evelyn! What are you trying to do, look like me? Are you OK? Yeah. What's the matter? No, you- D'oy. They call it the vacant sea. None of the major sea lanes go through it... and you can bury the entire land mass of Asia there... and nobody would know. From there, they could attack anywhere. Our last signals intercept... indicate that the Japanese taskforce is heading south... towards the Philippines or southeast Asia. But Captain Thurman of Naval intelligence here... has his own theory about the missing ships. Sir, I believe they'll try to hit us... where it'll hurt us the most- Pearl Harbor. It's over 4,000 nautical miles from Japan to Pearl. That's a long distance to steam a navy, Captain. Your theory is based on what? Well, it's what I would do. That's not exactly hard evidence, Captain Thurman. Well, Admiral, if I had hard evidence... we'd already be at war. Sir, we can read their diplomatic codes... faster than they can type them. But Captain Thurman's cryptology team... is still trying to crack the naval codes. The intercepts have missing words and garbled lines... so to explain the decrypts, we have to try to interpret... what we think they're trying to do. Interpret? You mean guess. They use their informed intuition, sir. We guess. It's like playing chess in the dark. Any rumor, troop movement, ship movement... spine-tingle, goose bump, we pay attention to it. When I was in the Asiatic Fleet... the locals used to try to get outside of a problem... to try to see the inside. Well, I see a strike on Pearl. It's the worst thing that could happen. A blow to Pearl would devastate... the Pacific Fleet's ability to make war. So, sir, you would have us mobilize the entire fleet... at the cost of millions of dollars... based on this spine-tingling feeling of yours? No, sir. My job is to gather and interpret material. Making difficult decisions... based on incomplete information... from my limited decoding ability... is your job, sir. Then break the damn naval code, Captain... so I can make a better decision. Aye, sir. We are trying. I wonder if we shouldn't put the Pacific Fleet on full alert. In case the optimism... of the "Honolulu Advertiser" proves unfounded, gentlemen... what are General Short and the Army... going to do about protecting my ships? Within a ten-mile radius of your harbor... we have fighterplanes here at Wheeler... bombers at Hickam, and a trainingstrip at Haleiwa. We've recently established a radar station here... that can detect planes 125 miles out. Which is a month old, Admiral, and untested. I've seen these new radar screens, Major. There's no way of telling whether they're ours, theirs... or a flock of damn birds. I'm intercepting a call from Tokyo... to somewhere close by Pearl. There's a call from Tokyo. They say they don't know you. Hello? Hai. It's a local dentist. He can see Pearl Harbor from his office. Are there many sailors around? Uh, the dentist says that the flatships... are not in port. They're talking about the weather. He doesn't seem to know who he's talking to. Hello? Hello? Moshi moshi. Hello? That was a strange call. Admiral, may I speak to you in private? Why would a spy use a phone? They know we tap all international lines. Our listeners feel it's probably not code talk. It sounds like someone in Japan is sneaking around... asking a local citizen the location of our carriers. Well, that makes me feel all warm inside. Get the FBI on it immediately. Have we found the goddamn Japanese Fleet yet? No, Admiral. The bases are looking all over the Pacific. So the entire fleet could be rounding Diamond Head... and we wouldn't know a thing about it. Get on it. I'm alive. This is the first I could get word out. Jepense qu'il est mort! ll estencore en vie. I told you I'd come back. Here, sit down. Sit down. Come here. It's OK. It's all right. You're real. Yeah. I wished for this every day. I know. Me, too. Every second. So did I. I thought you were dead. They said you were shot down in the sea. Yeah, I was. I was in the ocean. It was so cold. I missed you. I got picked up by a French fishing boat... and I was in occupied France, and I couldn't get word out. And I'm just-I'll tell you all about it, I promise. But I'm fine. I'm OK. And I'm here now. Evelyn... I just wanted to see you. You're so beautiful. I love you. Hey, it's OK. It's OK. Evelyn, Evelyn. I'm back. It's OK. I won't leave you again, I promise. Rafe, you died. And so did I. I know, but I'm-I'm- It's fine now. I'm back. We're together. I mean, we are together... right? I don't know where I am. Rafe. Rafe. Stay away. Rafe. This is Radio Honolulu... playing the sweetest music... on the sweetest island in the Pacific. It's a beautiful December 6th... with beautiful music... Raaaaafe! Oh, Goddamnit. There you go. A real live ace! Whoo! An ace is only five. I shot down six M.E.s. And I got two smokers, too. They don't count them. Of course, I got shot down myself before they could pin me. So you got back from behind enemy lines, huh? What's that combat like? Were you scared? Hey! One at a time. Well, them Luftwaffe boys can fly pretty good. It's not like, you know, training. They're, uh... Danny. You know, they're all about tactics is what it is. See, the Nazis, right, they're faster than you are... so they'll disappear and they get up in the soup... and they'll throw like a roll or a hammerhead... and they'll come around on your high side... shoot you from behind- like some Americans will. Hey... Gooz, you're lookin' at a real live ace. Well, let me give you the shirt off my back! Whoo! Aloha! There you go! I'll take it from you. I can see how y'all been spending your time out here. Hey, Rafe, we gotta talk, all right? I got nothin' to talk about with you. Here. Why don't you have a drink? I'll make a toast. To returning from the dead. Wasn't all I expected, but, well, that's life. To my best friend and loyal buddy Danny... for keepin' up the war effort back here at home. Ahh. You know, where I come from... somebody makes a toast to you and you don't drink... that's sayin' something. All right, Rafe. That's how it's gonna be. To you. Hey, you guys need to spend some time alone, I think. Aw, hell, no, Red. Come on. No, no, no. We're celebratin' here. Me over there fightin'... almost gettin' killed... my friend Danny back here... lookin' after my interests for me. Y'all know Danny was even good enough... to look out for my girl for me while I was gone? We thought you were dead, Rafe. And it gutted us both. And we were just tryin' to get on with our lives. Life is good, ain't it, Danny? You know, you're a rotten drunk. You always have been. Well, you're a lousy friend. That's a new development. You left her to fight somebody else's war... and you made damn sure that I didn't go with you... and we thought that you were dead- I almost did die, you little son of a bitch! And her face was the last thing that went through my mind... so don't stand there and tell me to act like it's all right! Yeah, Rafe, well, I stayed. I stayed, and you made sure of that... and some things changed. And I hope you can get used to that. Oh, I have to get used to it? All right. We'll see how I can get used to it. - Whoa! - Hey! Get used to that, boy! Hey, hey! And that's my left hand, too! Hey, hey, hey! Hey, come on! Melee at the Hula-la. Send M.P.s! - Aah! - Aah! - You called me a lousy friend? - Get your hands off! Aah! Ow! Shit! Come on, Danny! Let's go get 'em. Let's move out! Oh, no. They're gonna throw us in the brig. Let's get outta here. Oh, shit. Rafe... you're the only family I got. When you were gone... it was the loneliest I'd ever been. The same for her, too. Oh, boy, now you're really breakin' my heart. If you hadn't gone, none of this woulda happened. Oh, so it's my fault, I guess. Damn it, Rafe. I just know there's got to be some way... we can work things out so that... things could be right between me and you. I just don't see how it could ever be the same. Revered father... I go now to fulfill my mission and my destiny. I hope it is a destiny... that will bring honor to our family... and if it requires my life... I will sacrifice it gladly... to be a good servant of our nation. Hey... we got a large haze. That's too big to be planes, right? Is that what you wanna do? Knight to knight five? Boom! Wrong move. Lieutenant, radar's picking up... a large return moving in from the northeast. Hang on. Relax. It's a flight of B-17s coming in from the mainland. Nothing to worry about. A heck of a lot of B-17s. Good shot, Hop. This better be good, Commander. One of our destroyers reports having fired and sunk... enemy submarine attempting to enter Pearl Harbor at 0653. It's 7:20! We had decoder delays, Admiral. Relay this to Washington. Recall the staff. "Failure... "'Peace talks... "useless. " Thurman here. Tokyo transmitting... to their embassy in Washington- "Discontinue use of your decoding machine... "and dispose of immediately. "Special emphasis on destroying important parts. " Do you read that? Acknowledge. Admiral... Naval Intel intercepted a transmission from Tokyo... to the Japanese embassy in Washington... instructing them to break apart all decoder machines... and burn all secret documents. The Japanese are expecting a war. Should we? Warning of possible... Japanese aggressive movement in any direction. "Broken relationship. Hostilities imminent. " But where? Did you ever lose a fight, Miller? I been lucky so far, Captain. From what I hear, it ain't luck. Ship's proud of you, son. Ha ha ha. Yeah! Ha ha! Why the hell's the Navy... doing practice this early on a Sunday? - Aah! - Get down! Go, go, go, go! I'm with Navy newsreel, and I can tell you one thing- them ain't Navy planes! All hands, man your battle stations! We're being bombed! We're being bombed! Get up! Get up! Jesus Christ! Man your battle stations. Another dumb drill.

Holy cow! I hope there's still an airfield left. Hurry up! What in the world? Look! So many! Everybody to the hospital! Why's the Navy always buzzin' us? shut up, Red! - Oh, man, come on. - Red, it's too early. The Japs are here! What the hell? Let's go! Let's go! - Get corpsmen to the bridge. - Aye, Captain! Repair says third deck is flooding port side! Yaah! Uhh! Get up! Get up, you cowards! Get up there and fight! Move it! Take cover! I got you, Captain. You radio for air cover! Initiate damage control! Find my X.O. Tell him to assume command. And you make sure the gunners- Everyone's where they need to be, Captain. You trained us well. Captain... Aah! Go, go, go, go! Let's go! Let's go! Everybody move! Get the ammo for that fifty cal! Get that fifty cal! Let's go! We gotta get- Come on, man, we gotta get this thing loaded up! - Aah! - Aah! Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Let's go! Let's go! Danny, get me into a damn plane! Come on! Get some ammo up here! We need some men on these guns! Sir! The captain says you're in charge, sir! We need more ammo! Now! Send up ammunition for the five-inch guns! Medic! All of 'em, now! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Come on! Aah! Come on! Come on, you sum 'bitch! Aah! Aah ha! Oh, yeah! I need a doctor! Somebody help me! Get to the supply room! Get everything out! - Aah! - Planes incoming! Cut 'em down! Come on, come on! Get 'em away from the windows! The mattresses! Get 'em against the wall! Take cover! Is everybody all right? Can you stand? Can you stand? Hold your fire! Get to the gun! Hurry up! Get down, Danny! Aah! - Earl! - This is Walker! We need to get those planes fueled and loaded right now! What's going on out there? Huh? Danny, what the hell's that noise? You guys doin' target practice or something? I think World War II just started. Go, go, go! - Billy! - Run! - It's gonna blow! - It's a dud. It's a dud! Come on, get down! Danny! Danny, are you all right? I'm all right! Come on, let's go! Come on, let's go! Gooz, come on, man! We're sinking! We're sinking! Stay together! Close the hatches! - I can't swim! - Just hang on! Let's move it now! Joe! Go! Go! We're gettin' outta here! Get in the car! Get in! Get in! Come on, let's go! Go! Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Come on! Where's this place we're goin'? We got a small mechanic runway about ten minutes away. Hasn't been hit yet. We got Zeros on our six! Duck! Help us! Aah! We're trapped. Try it! Try the door! Aah! Oh, my God! I'm going under! It's sucking me back! The current's too strong! They're shootin' at us! I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die! This is it. Get us out of here now! How bad? It's still not over, sir. An entire fleet at anchor. My God, my God... Barbara, fill every syringe you can find with morphine! Fill up the kitchen! Are you listening to me? Fill up the kitchen! Over there! Over there! We got a bad neckwound here! Surgery! Move! Get him to surgery! Oh, God. In here! He's still bleeding! Another hemostat! Hurry! Give me a hemostat now! Damn it, hurry! Gimme another hemostat! Another suture! Hurry! Give me a- Oh, God, I'm so sorry! Doctor! Here! Aah! Am I gonna die? Nurse! Don't leave me! Doctor! Get over here! My fingers are plugging his artery! Doctor, what do you need? Focus, look at me. What do you need? - Hemostat. - Hemostat. Here. All right, look at me. You're going to be all right. You're going to be all right. I need more ammo! I need more ammo, ladies! I need more ammo! Earl! We good to go? - Mostly, but- - Get down! - Shit! Get cover! - Jesus! - Come on, you guys! - Earl, get in here! Sergeant! We need more than a shotgun! You got any other weapons for coverfire? Inside that ammo locker! - Come on! - Move it! - Go! Go! - Get the guns out! You said the planes are mostly ready, but... but what? She's down, she's broke, she's shit. I got four left. One's good, two need ammo, one needs fuel. Fall out and load up in the bunker! Let's go! Get down! - Move! - Get ready to roll this thing! Get down! Now!

Nobody fire! Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God. They don't know we're here. - Stay down. - Fire? No, God damn it, stay down, stay still. Don't fire. Oh, God. I don't see any ordnance. I think they're going home. No. They'll be back. We still got planes on the ground. Pilots, listen up. Get all the speed you can on the runway... don't get on the stick till the very end. In the air, stay low between the buildings. You see any Zero on your tail... wipe him off, don't freeze. Just keep moving. Try to separate 'em, take 'em out one by one. P-40s can't outrun Zeros, so don't try. We have to outfly 'em. We got high-level bombers! They'll bust this hangar wide open! Grab the fifties! Let's move! Move! Move! Go, go, go! Zeros! Take cover! Take cover! Take cover! Take cover! Aah! - Get down! Get down! - Let's go! In the box! Aah! Danny! Come on! Come on, buddy! Leave him, he's dead! He's dead! They're kicking our butt.

Turn! Oh, God! Aah! Oh, shit. What are you doing? Get going! Danny, start that thing up and get in the air. I'm not much good without a wing man. I need you! I got you! Let's do it! It's real tight, Rafe! Real tight! Hey, Rafe, I'm not sure we have enough runway! Get your airspeed up before you leave the dirt! Don't freeze. Don't freeze. I don't think I'm gonna make it over! Come on! Come on! We did it! I'm up! We got Zeros behind us! How many you see back there? We got five on our six! Take it down to the deck, now! We gotta split 'em up. You take left, I'll take right. Earl, get some guns in that goddamn tower! OK! Let's go! Into the truck! Danny, I got three on my six. Whoo! Stop! Stop! Let's go! Let's go! Move it! Move it, Red! - Let's go! - Gimme the fifty! Let's go! All right! I still got two behind me, Rafe. Yaah! Son of a bitch! Whoa! Earl, God damn it, get some guns in that tower! On the tower. Going ten stories up. It's a long son of a bitch. Rafe, they're all over me! I can't get them off me! Danny, I still got three on my tail! Keep jinking it! Don't let them get a handle! I can't shake 'em! God damn it. Danny, let's play chicken with these Jap suckers! I'm with you. Jesus! - I'm coming right at you! - Don't brake till I tell you. Not yet! Not yet! Come on! Go left! Now! - Whoo! We got 'em! - Ha ha ha! Set up over there! Come on, load it! We're on the tower. I got one on my tail. I'll bring him right by you. He's comin' around! Let's get this Jap sucker! Hold your fire. Here he comes. You better be cocked and locked when I come by! Hold your fire! Fire! Whoo! Good shootin', boys! Nice shot, Earl! Let's head over to battleship row! I'm with you! Let's go do some business. I'm going after 'em. Rafe! I got him! - P-40's! - Yeah! They're pulling into the clouds! We ain't gonna let these sons of bitches get home! How do you like someone shooting back at you? Oh, I'm on your ass now! Yeah! I got one! Come on! God, come on! Come on, stay in there! Whoa! I got you, you son of a bitch! Who taught you how to fly, Lieutenant? He did. I have to amputate here! I have to amputate! You're not gonna die! I got you. Hold onto this... Sandra, we're running out of morphine. Find some way to mark 'em... So we can keep track of who's got morphine already. Tell me about your ship. What ship are you from? It's not marking. Have you got a marker? Use my lipstick! Put "M" for morphine. - We need a tourniquet! - Tourniquet! Where are the clamps? There's nothing left! - Evelyn! - Here, use this. Go outside. There's too many to help. Sort them out. Only those that can be saved you bring in. I can't... No, please, I need you to do it! Go! Go! Aah! Don't look at anyone without a mark! I told you, stand back! Keep 'em outside! Come on! Let's go! Wait here. Don't touch me, you Jap! Get your hands off me! Get him into critical. - Get him off me. - Critical, frontward! How bad am I? You're gonna be just fine, sweetheart. - I don't wanna die. - You're not gonna die. I've got your hand. Do you have enough morphine to make him comfortable? He won't make it. Line the critical up! Get him morphine. Take him over there! Burn victims by the tree! I just found her! I don't think she's breathing. No, she's dead. Take her- Oh, God. Are you sure, Ev? Check her again. She's dead. Take her over there! But you've gotta be sure! She's dead! Go back to work, Sandra. I don't know what to do! Over here! Admiral? From Washington. "Attack by Japan considered imminent. " They're only an hour late. How can we help? We need blood. Come on. Remember, son, hold on to your faith. 1,500 cartons over there. "'Today you will be with me in paradise... "so fear not. " Fear not, my son. You are a man truly blessed. You will die in a state of grace. Remember, pain is temporary, but glory is forever. Hold on to your faith, my son. You'll be with God, the saints, and the angels soon. I absolve you of your sins... in the name of the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit. Innomine patris et fili, et spiritus sancti. Amen. Go with God, my son. We've got men trapped everywhere in the harbor. We need help from anybody who can move. There's somebody in here! Get somebody down here! They're cutting through! I hear somebody! Get some guys up here! Pull! Get us out! It's filling with water! Get an airline in here! We need the air hose! What can we do? It won't cut any faster! - Cut him out! - Aah! Yesterday... December 7, 1941... a date which will live in infamy... the United States of America... was suddenly and deliberately attacked... by naval and air forces of the empire of Japan. It is obvious... that planning the attack began many weeks ago. During the intervening time... the Japanese government... has deliberately sought to deceive the United States... by false statements... and expressions of hope for continued peace. The attack yesterday on the Hawaiian Islands... has caused severe damage to American military forces. I regret to tell you... that over 3,000 American lives have been lost. No matter how long it may take us... to overcome this premeditated invasion... the American people, in their righteous might... will win through to absolute victory. Because of this unprovoked, dastardly attack by Japan... I ask that the Congress declare a state of war. Is it true... men are still trapped alive inside the Arizona? We can hear tapping from inside the hull. We're doing everything we can to get to them... but they're forty feet below water. We've been trained to think that we're invincible. And now our proudest ships have been destroyed... by an enemy we considered inferior. We're on the ropes, gentlemen. That's exactly why we have to strike back now. We'll attack the Marshall and Gilbert Islands, sir. I mean hitting the heart of Japan the way they have hit us. Mr. President... Pearl Harbor caught us unawares because we didn't face facts. This isn't a time for ignoring them again. We have long-range bombers, but no place to launch them. Midway is too far, and Russia won't allow us... to launch a raid from there. Admiral? Navy's planes are small. They carry light loads and have a short range. We'd have to get them within a few hundred miles of Japan. We'd risk our carriers, and if we lose them... we'll have no shield against invasion. Does anyone in this room think victory is possible... without facing danger? We are at war. Of course there's a risk. But consider the risk, Mr. President. If the Japanese invade us right now... they would reach Chicago before we could stop them. Gentlemen... most of you did not know me when I had the use of my legs. I was strong and proud... and arrogant. Now I wonder, every hour of my life... why God put me into this chair. But when I see defeat in the eyes of my country men- in your eyes, right now- I start to think that maybe he brought me down... for times like these... when we all need to be reminded who we truly are- that we will not give up or give in. Mr. President, with all respect, sir... what you're asking can't be done. - Mr. President! - Get back, George! Get back. Do not tell me... it can't be done. Japan continues its military conquest... throughout the Pacific. But, back home... millions of American workers band together... bringing factories to life to avenge Pearl Harbor. Mr. President, we have an idea how to bomb the Japanese. Sir, it's risky... but it's bold. - Who are you? - I, sir? Captain Low, Mr. President. He's a submariner. He came up with this idea. I like sub commanders. They don't have time for bullshit, and neither do I. Fire away, gentlemen. And where is God in all this? Our enemies believe a divine wind protects them. But we see our friends laid out here before us. Hey, Captain. Lieutenants Rafe McCawley, Daniel Walker. Yes, Major? You're both going stateside. Fly out in two hours. What for, sir? Ask Colonel Doolittle. Yes, sir. You're packing. Orders. What kind of orders? The top-secret kind. The dangerous kind. I can't find Danny. Is that why you're here? Looking for Danny? Probably saying good-bye to his squadron. We've been assigned to Doolittle. I wasn't looking for Danny. I couldn't have you go away... without you understanding something. Yeah. You don't have to explain anything. I do, because you're acting like I didn't love you. Evelyn, loving you kept me alive. I should've died over there. When I was in that water, I made a deal with God. I told him I was sorry... that I knew I'd been a fool for leaving you... trying to go over there and be a hero... and I promised I'd never ask for anything again... if I could just see you one more time. And you know what? It was worth it. You kept me alive, Evelyn. You brought me home. So I'm gonna stand by my end of the deal. I'm gonna walk away. And I won't ask you for anything. But I just want to know why. Just tell me that, will you, please? Just tell me why. Rafe, I'm pregnant. Oh, my God. I didn't even know until the day you turned up alive. And then all this happened. I haven't told Danny. I don't want him to know. All he needs to think about... is how to do this mission and get back alive. Rafe, all I ever wanted... was for us to have a home, grow old together... but life never asked me what I wanted. Now, I'm gonna give Danny my whole heart... but I don't think I'll ever look at another sunset... without thinking of you. I'll love you my whole life. I'll see you on board. You know, the only thing that scares me... is that you might love him more than you love me. I love you, Danny. And I'll be here waiting for you when you come back. Follow me. Colonel. Congratulations on your promotion, sir. I heard what you did. We can explain that, sir. Explain what? Whatever it is you heard about us, sir. You mean the hula shirts you were flying in? Or the seven planes you shot down? You're both being awarded the Silver Star... and promoted to captain. Is that the good news, sir, or... You're just about the only pilots in the Army... with combat experience. I need you for a mission... I've been ordered to put together. You know what top secret is? Yes, sir. It's the kind of mission where you get medals. But they send 'em to your relatives. Top secret means you train for something... never done before in aviation history... and you go without knowing where you're going. You do it on that basis or not at all. I'll go, sir. I'll go, too, sir. By the way, the Brits sent over your personal effects. Thank you, sir. There's only one more thing. Leave your goddamn hula shirts at home. Dear Rafe... It's so strange to be this far from you... but you should know this- every night... I've been looking all over for you. Danny, this... this ain't no time to leave things unsaid. Now, we gotta face facts here. The fact is, we just both love the same woman. She's the first girl I ever felt this way about, Rafe. I couldn't help what happened any more than you could. This is different, though, Danny. Evelyn already lost the man she loved once. I just don't want it to see that happen to her again. Guys like us got no choice. This is war. She knows that. Danny, don't do this. Don't go on this mission. You got nothing to prove. You've been protecting me since we were kids. Yeah, well... you do tend to need it from time to time. The mission I'm asking you to volunteer for... is exceptionally dangerous. Take a look at the man beside you. It's a good bet that in the next six weeks... you or he... will be dead. Everyone brave enough to accept this... step forward. Your grandmother could take a B-25 off... on a mile-long runway. Well, I'm gonna train you to do it in 467 feet. Because at 468 feet... you're dead. And once you get it up... you'll learn to fly it like a fighter... thirty feet off the ground. I want you to say hello... to Lieutenant Jack Richards, Navy Aviation. He'll help us lighten these fat ladies. Dump that ash can. See that bomb sight? Get rid of it. Colonel, he's crazy! - The lady's fat! - Listen to him. She's fat. We want a skinny lady! Max power! Get up, get up! - Damn! - How the heck- Damn! They just keep rolling past that line. Maybe it's a bad idea. No, they're too heavy. We gotta get drastic. This armored plating goes. I'm sure, I'm sure. Lose it like a skirt, son. Release brakes! Come on, come on! - God! - Put every man on the line! Let's show these boys how this thing is done! Come on! Max power. Well, if he can do it... Well, gentlemen, now I can tell you... that we're going to Tokyo. And we're gonna bomb it. That comes as a special request... directly from President Roosevelt. The Navy'll sneak us about 400 miles off the coast... and we'll launch from the carrier there. Has that been done before? Taking Army bombers off Navy carriers? - No. - OK. Any other questions? Well, sir, is it even possible to land... a B-25 on an aircraft carrier deck? That won't matter. As soon as we're airborne, the carrier heads for Hawaii. But without them, where do we land? I have a phrase I want you to memorize. Wo shimeiguo ren. It means "I am an American". In Chinese. Ain't gonna be any easier. That's three feet shorter than our practice runway. - Fellas? - Sir. Sir. Secretary of the Navy gave me these. What are they? Friendship medals the Japanese gave us... when they were pretending to want peace. What'll you do with them? Wire them to the bombs and give them back. So what's going on? Well, sir, we only have sixteen planes. So? When the Japs hit us, they had more than 300. How much difference can we make? It's not that we're afraid, sir. But we might die, and we want to know what it's for. You know, at Pearl, they hit us with a sledgehammer. This raid, even if we make it through... it'll only be a pin prick... but it'll be straight through their hearts. Victory belongs to those that believe in it the most... and believe in it the longest. We're gonna believe. We're gonna make America believe, too. Colonel? I need a minute. - Excuse me, Major Jackson? - Yes? Do you remember me? Oh, sure I do. I'm sorry. I've been meaning to thank you. Well, maybe you can. When the news comes in about the Doolittle boys... I want to be in the command post. I'm sorry. I don't know what you're talking about. How the hell do you know about this mission? Let's call it an inadvertent disclosure. Some flyboy you're dating shot his mouth off. Actually, it's about two pilots. I know they're going into great danger. I just want to be there when the news tells us... if they've lived or died. Most officers would have thrown you in the brig. Most nurses wouldn't keep their fingers... plugged in your artery. I can't promise you anything. Hey, Red, you think they picked us... to do this 'cause we're young and dumb? Come on, Gooz, we're the tip of the sword. In honor of our trip to Japan... I got us some victory cigars! - Yeah! - There you go. Put that in your insidepocket, next to your heart. You know, Jack, we may lose this battle... but we're gonna win this war. - You know how I know? - No. Them. 'Cause they're rare. And at times like these, you see them... stepping forward. There's nothing stronger than the heart of a volunteer, Jack. My friends in the war department... don't want me to lead this raid... because they say I'm too valuable. They don't want me up in the air... flying with the men that I've chosen... that I've chewed out, cussed out, pushed to the limit... and that I've come to respect. They want me to stand on the flight deck... and wave you off. Well, I don't see it that way. So I'm going with you. We take off tomorrow afternoon... drop our fire, and head for China. Our mission is to hit military targets... aircraft and tank factories. Colonel, you've given us homing beacons... but you said China is overrun with Japanese troops. What if the beacons are switched off? Bring her down any way you can... and do your best to avoid capture. What if we have to bail out over Japan? Well, in that situation, I can't tell you what to do. What would you do, Colonel? I wasn't built to be a prisoner... so I would have my crew bail out. I'd find the sweetest military target I could... and drive my plane right smack into the middle of it... But that's just me. I'm forty-five years old. I'm an old man. You guys have your whole lives ahead of you... so what you do is up to you. The mission will launch in a couple of hours. You'll stay right in here. Here. Stay here. Don't talk to them. They won't talk to you. Pretend to type the information we pass you. That's it. This is Orphan Annie from Radio Tokyo. To all the lonely boys in the South Pacific... watch out- the enemy will get you. Maybe she's right. Japs transmitting! Captain, radar reports Japanese patrol boats. - Range 400 yards. - How many yards? 400 yards and closing, sir. Richards, Japs! 400 yards! Let's go! Admiral Halsey's ordering the cruisers to open fire! We gotta sink these Jap boats before they give us away. Go to general quarters! Go, go, go, go! Oh, my God. This can't be good! All hands, man your battle stations. Japs one mile away. They reported our position. Supposed to launch 400 miles away. How far are we? 624 miles. - Jesus! - What do you want to do? Colonel, I don't know if the planes... can carry enough fuel to make it to China. Now. We launch now! Army pilots! Man your planes! Man your planes! They're shooting at something. - Let's go! - It ain't a drill! Colonel! We're too far out to make it! They need more fuel, but they can't get too heavy! Strip everything out of this plane you don't need now! Start pre-flight! Let's go! Add ten cans of fuel for each plane! Every plane! Let's go! Move! Guys, get up there! Lose those suitcases now! - What's your favorite gun? - What? You want off this deck, give me a gun now! It's still too heavy! Go to the kitchen, get some broomsticks. Cut 'em down, paint 'em black, and bring them here. We'll put a broomstick where this gun was. What are you doing to my plane? Tell your crew to take a piss before they take off. We got broomsticks for tail guns. Yeah. Maybe it'll scare 'em. You take care of yourself up there. Yeah, I will. Danny, be careful, you hear me? I will. I'll see you, Rafe. Rafe! We're the tip of the sword! - Turning on one! - Turning on two! All right. You ready for this? - Superchargers low and latched! - Low and latched. We're full into the wind! More speed! More speed! Are you nervous? No-yes, sir. Yes. When did you find religion? When you assigned me to this mission, sir. Do me a favor. - What's that, Colonel? - Pray for both of us. Tell me when! Let's go! Max power! Oh, please. Come on! Come on! Yeah! Way to go! Jesus, that was short. Move 'em up! Full power, here we go! Pull back! Ha ha ha! Come on, here we go, here we go! We made it! From Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo... we have been described... as a nation of weaklings and playboys... who hire British, Russian, or Chinese soldiers... to do our fighting for us. Let them repeat that now. Let them tell that to General MacArthur and his men. Let them tell that to the soldiers who today... are fighting hard in the far waters of the Pacific. Let them tell that to the boys in the flying fortresses. Let them tell that to the Marines. That's Japan, fellas. Tighten up back there! Man your guns! We're in the enemy's backyard! Look alive back there. I see coastline. Heads up, boys! Heads up! Man your guns back there. I'm cocked and locked! Get ready, suckers! Approaching targets for bombing raid! Open bomb bay doors. Ripley, you gota target in sight? 37 degrees! Target in sight! All right, boys, let's knock their clocks off! - Drop your ordnance! - Bombs away! One away! - Bombs away! - Bombs away! Two away! Three away! Four away! We caught 'em by surprise! - Dropping ordnance! - Bombs away! ...factory. - Whoo! - We got it! We hit our targets! Good job, raiders! God! Jesus-what? Shit! We got flak everywhere! Go down there and get Gooz! I want everyone to separate! - Clean that up! - Yes, sir. Try and clean that up! They're shooting flak at us! We gotta get out of this shit, Gooz! - We got a fire! - Tail's hit! The electrics! We got a fire back here! I gotta short this out! Get into the clouds, Danny, right now! God damn! Red, go check that out! We're getting covered! Just hope they don't hit a prop! Unh! I'm hit! They're tearing this plane apart! Red, take it up, 800 feet. Aah! I think Theo's dead! Theo, wake up! Theo! Get into the clouds, Danny, right now! Get up in that soup! We're gonna pull out of this, Gooz! Thank you, George. What is it, General? Colonel Doolittle had to advance his execution order... by twelve hours, Mr. President. There will be no homing beacons. The plane carrying them crashed en route to China... and our bombers may lack the fuel... to reach the mainland, sir. So our boys are flying blind on empty tanks. God help them. We're still not getting a signal. All ocean and no land. Homing in on nothing. How many cans of fuel we got left? These are all empty! Is this all you got? That's all we got, Red. Rafe! You better pray for land! Break radio silence. I'm sorry, gentlemen. You're all brave souls. The bravest I've ever had the privilege of flying with. But we're on our own. This really was a suicide mission. Engine one's fluctuating. We'll lose it any minute. - Rafe, you gotta prime it. - I am. How about now? I see the coast. I see the coast! Copy that, Rafe. We're gonna make it. Danny, follow me. We can make this. I can see the coast now. We're only a few miles out. We gotta find a soft landing spot. I'm pushing up on two. Hold on for a hard landing! I see rice paddies. We'll bring it in right here. Oh, God, engine one's dead. We'll lose engine two any second. We can make it in. Easy. Pull it back, glide in on fumes. Japs! We got Jap patrols all over the place! Japs! Land somewhere else! Strap yourselves in! We're coming in hard! We're a deadstick. Get outta the nose! Hold on, boys! We're going down! Watch the trees! Everyone all right? I'm OK! I'm OK! Where's Ripley? He's dead. Watch for Japs! - Jap patrols! - Take cover! Who's got magazines? Got em! Gotta get up into those hills, find the Chinese! They got us pinned down! - Danny! - Rafe! Rafe, no! Danny! Rafe, you don't have a chance! God damn. Danny! Come on! Gooz? You OK, man? Danny? Aw, shit, Anthony. Gooz! Can you hear me? - Yeah. - Come on. Danny. Easy, easy, easy. I've had better landings. You saved us back there. I got something in my neck. - Let me pull this out. - Where's Gooz? He's fine. He's right over there. Rafe! Grenade! Danny. Danny! Danny! Oh! - Hold on! - Rafe! Hold on, now. I got you. You're all right. You're all right. I'm not gonna make it. Oh, yes, you are. Yes, you are. Now look at me. Rafe, I'm so cold. I'm so cold. You're all right. Hey. Hey, Rafe? Can you do me a favor? What? Can you have someone else write my name on the tombstone? You're not gonna die. Look at me, listen to me! You ain't gonna die, you hear me? Danny. Danny, you can't die. You can't die. You know why? 'Cause you're gonna be a father. You're gonna be a daddy. I wasn't supposed to tell you. You're gonna be a father. Please. No. You are. Danny. Danny? Please, please! Please. God. Please, Danny. Hold your fire! They're Chinese. When the action is over and we look back... we understand both more and less. This much is certain. Before the Doolittle raid... America knew nothing but defeat. After it, there was hope of victory. Japan realized for the first time that they could lose... and began to pull back. America realized that she would win... and surged forward. It was a war that changed America... ...and the world. Dorie Miller was the first black American... to be awarded the Navy Cross. But he would not be the last. He joined a brotherhood of heroes. That's for all the raiders. World War II for us began at Pearl Harbor... and 1,177 men still lie entombed... in the battleship Arizona. America suffered... but America grew stronger. It was not inevitable. The times tried our souls... and through the trial, we overcame. Hey, Danny... how'd you like to go flying? Come here. When I think back on these times And the dreams we left behind I'll be glad 'cause I was blessed To get to have you in my life When I look back on these days I'll look and see your face You were right there for me In my dreams I'll always see you Soar above the sky In my heart, there'll always be a place for you For all my life I'll keep a part of you with me And everywhere I am There you'll be And everywhere I am There you'll be Well, you showed me how it feels Feel the sky with in my reach And I always will remember All the strength you gave to me Your love made me make it through Oh, I owe so much to you You were right there for me In my dreams I'll always see you Soar above the sky In my heart, there'll always be A place for you For all my life I'll keep a part of you with me And everywhere I am There you'll be 'Cause I always saw in you my light My strength And I want to thank you now For all the ways You were right there for me You were right there for me For always In my dreams I'll always see you Soar above the sky In my heart, there'll always be A place for you For all my life I'll keep a part of you with me And everywhere I am There you'll be And everywhere I am There you'll be There you'll be
