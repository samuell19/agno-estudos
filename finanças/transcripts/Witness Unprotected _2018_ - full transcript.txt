[instrumental music] [music continues] Oh, come on. Mm. Oh! It's about time. So... we have three bathrooms. -Yeah. -Attached. And I cannot wait to show you the bedrooms. -Have they been broken in yet? -Not yet. Ooh, when the cat's away. Hmm. [cellphone buzzing] Oh. Hey, Laurie. What's up? Thought you were coming home early tonight. Yeah. Last minute assignment, honey, um... I couldn't pass it up. It shouldn't be that long. [Laurie] What is it this time? I really shouldn't talk about it. I'll bet. What a way to make a living. Sometimes I wonder how you manage to sleep at night. Uh, I manage to sleep at night just fine knowing that someone's college tuition is paid through spring. Alright, I take that back. -Thank you. -Have you eaten today? Yes. Yes, I have. Probably some sort of fast food garbage. No, not at all. And I'm not gonna be lectured by a 19-year-old. I think I know what's good for me. Do you really? Unfortunately for you wisdom is not a by-product of age. Ha-ha, so funny. Let me remind you that I'm the adult and you're the child. I think that's for you to remember. Oh, my God, you're hilarious. Whatever. Anyway, um, this won't be long and you don't have to wait up for me if you don't want to. I wouldn't dream of it. -Bye, honey. -Good night, mom. Hope they make this quick. [instrumental music] Hurry up. It's not polite to keep your date waiting. [music continues] [dramatic music] [instrumental music] Two go in and one comes out. [Joe] What do you got, Sam? Hey. Hey, Joe, so, uh yeah, our girl was here and, uh, she wasn't alone, just like you thought. Maybe there's something to our guy's story after all. Joe, I don't mind taking a picture of the, some faded movie star at the airport. I mean, I don't even mind interrupting their dinner at the Ivy Wine, but this whole sneaking around chasing bad guys, it's just not my bag. I mean, it just leaves a bad taste. If you got everything we need, you should wrap it up. But I got her going into the house, but... But what? Well, the boyfriend just drove off without her. Just get out of there. Joe, what if someone's hurt? I'll see you in the morning. [sighs] Okay, you're the boss. Probably gonna hate myself for this. Wow, nice house. Wonder what they want for it. [intense music] Oh, boy. Freeze! Hands in the air. Oh, yeah, I hate myself. Down on the floor now. [Matthew] You're in a very tight spot, Ms. Roberts. I already told you, I didn't do anything. That might be hard to prove. Hmm, that might be hard to disprove, too. Why were you in that house? As I told you, the man came out alone and sped off in the car. Call it curiosity, I just had to know. Couldn't help myself. [clears throat] Is this the woman you saw going into the house last night? Yeah, could be, it was dark but may be. Who is she? So you can't ID her? I am sorry, I'm trying to help you. I... Can I ask you a question? How on earth did your boys make it so fast to the scene? Neighbor reported someone prowling around. Wow, that's amazing response time like I am so impressed. -We try. -Ah! -And did you find her car? -About a half mile up. On the side of the road. So, is there anything else? I don't think so. -So, I can go. -For now. But we are gonna have to hold on to your memory card from your camera. Yeah, yeah, of course. Let me know if you, uh think of anything else. This is my private cell number. Private number? Wow. Yeah, I-I mean, I'm not at the building most of the time, so... Yeah, of course. Um, I will call you if I think of anything... Matthew. -Hey! -Mom. -Are you okay? -Yeah. I'm fine, thanks for coming. What else can you do when the cops pick up your mother? Ha-ha, I didn't do anything, alright. It was just a wrong place, wrong time kinda thing. I'm sure. Anyway, I picked up your car from the police impound. Oh, great, let's get out of here. Please sign here, Ms. Roberts. -My pleasure. -Thank you. Mom, can you tell me what this is all about? -I deserve to know. -I can, just not here. Of course, but... I'll tell you everything you wanna know. Just no lectures, alright? I wouldn't dream of it. [sighs] You have a lot of explaining to do. Oh, yeah, and if I can't you're gonna ground me for a week? This isn't funny. You could've gotten yourself killed. -You're overreacting. -And what is this? -This is a lifesaver. -Eww! Who's gonna mess with a half-eaten burrito, huh? You promised you'd start eating healthier. And I will, honey, starting tomorrow but right now, this really paid off. I switched out my camera card when they wanted me to get my license out of the car. So, can we go home? -Yes. -It's been a long night. Who are you? You know, you could get into a lot of trouble for not turning that card over to the police. I am gonna turn this over. I just need to make some hard copies that's what they pay me for. Mom, could you please tell me what's going on? And no more dodging. Okay. Alright, um... Here it is. A male client who must remain nameless was blackmailed by this Sheila Grant. And, uh, he seems to think that she had a partner someone who had an inside track on him. And he's paid us to try and find out who it is. -And did you? -I don't know. The man I saw could've been her partner but it also could've been one of her victims just pushed to his limit. You know, this might be dangerous. You don't wanna make me an orphan, do you? [chuckles] You're too old to be an orphan. Well, if something happens to you who will I have to look after? Aww. Nothing's gonna happen to me, honey. Don't worry, I'm just gonna... print this out, get them to Joe collect my pay, and then come clean with the cops. Oh! I'm sure they'll appreciate that. I'll come up with some story they'll believe in. Besides, I didn't do anything. [knocking on door] Oh, I got it. -Good afternoon, Ms. Roberts. -Detective. You making house calls now, or, uh... you here to arrest me again? No, I just wanted to, uh, return your SD card. Oh. Thanks. That's what I call public service. It was blank. Yeah, I told you it was really really dark, and I probably didn't have it seated in the camera properly. -I-- -Why don't I wanna believe you? -I have that kinda face. -Maybe. So, you've got nothing to add to all this? I'm trying, detective, I really am. Yeah, I appreciate that. As insincere as you may sound. And you, you came all the way out here just to return this? Why don't I wanna believe you? Well, let's just say I was, uh looking for an excuse to get out of the office for a while. -And I'm your alibi? -Sort of. Okay. You got it. However, I do need you to come down in a few days and look through our database to see if any of the faces jump out at you. Unless you'd, uh, care to come down now. Yeah, no, I've had enough of police hospitality for one day. I'll come by tomorrow, and, um... It was, you know, like I said. -It was very dark. -Yeah, it was dark. Here's her card, in case you think of anything. [Matthew] Thanks, I just might. Hey, mate. Ms. Roberts, this is my partner Detective Walker. Good afternoon, ladies. Detective. You guys, uh, know each other? No. No, I don't believe we do. Uh, no, of course not. Um... Maybe I saw you in the police station. Maybe. Hey, Matty, we're okay on that, uh, search warrant. Call me if you wanna talk about, you know, any of this. I will. He's handsome. And tall... Get in the house. Wow, what a grouch. You know, this is what happens when you don't eat right. Get in the house. Come on. You look spooked. No, I'm fine. It's... it's just a feeling. Hey, uh... We can, um, drop these off after lunch and go shopping, if you like. Shopping? Now you're talkin'. But first, let's eat. I'm starving... for, uh, something healthy. Oh, finally, someone around here listens to me. Oh, I listen to you. All the time. I just, you know, choose to ignore you. Now you're trying to give me a complex. So, it all boils down to this. Everything I shot right there. Good work. Now, you could be in contempt for holding back evidence. [Joe] These photographs are very likely of the guy that killed Sheila Grant. No kidding. What do you think I should do? Give me a day to finish up with the client turn the memory card over to the police. They got no real beef with you. I'm sure they'll forget about everything. And besides, I think that Detective Carlton likes you. -Laurie. -At least he's good-looking. He has a job, and no wedding ring. -Unlike some of your other-- -Laurie! Please. You got a little mother hen right there. She's her mother's keeper. [giggles] Oh, yeah, let's not forget. Oh... Thanks. Whoa. A little extra for good behavior. Well, I guess, uh, shopping's on me today. Finally, something we agree on. [indistinct chatter on radio] -Anything? -Whole lot of nothing. Huh. Take it to the back. Well, she surely lived well for a realtor. Yeah, but ask yourself... what do we really know about her? Real estate? Could be a front for something else. Drugs? Yup. Maybe. What we do know is that she was using her unsold properties to, uh, hook up. Yeah, but why? That we don't know. So, we should probably get search warrants for her other properties as well. Yeah. Never married. Four years at Clark State, nothing too scandalous. Well, but her fortune started to change around three years ago when she started buying some real estate. Look at that. She was developing some very, very expensive properties. Huh, and maybe some expensive habits. Mm-hmm. Don't you just hate a painting that won't hang straight? My wife absolutely hates a painting that doesn't hang straight. Huh. Oh, here's why. What is it? [Tom] Looks like photos. Very, very... naughty photos. Let me see. Whoa. This is quite the collection. Wonder if our guy's in here somewhere. Well, could be. [chuckles] Let me see. -Hard to digest but, uh... -And that one. ...something to start with, right? Yup. See definitely took yoga. Matt. Look what I found in the back of her closet. Blackmail? Well, could be, I mean, it's all cash and we do have about a dozen suspects here. Yeah, maybe more. She was a very busy woman. Very. Now, all we have to do is... identify these suspects. I think I may know someone who could help. Yeah? Here. Be back. -Make sure you log that down. -Yeah. So, when do you go back to campus? Carrie's picking me up at 3:30. Oh, my God, that's so soon. I was hoping you could stay longer. With everything you have going on here you really don't need me hanging around. -Who says? I like the company. -Really? I always imagined you couldn't shuffle me off to school fast enough. Excuse me, bite your tongue, lady. That was a very awkward time, okay? Your dad wanted a life without me and I was just chasing him around thinking that I could make things better. It was just sad. It was ugly. And you got caught in the middle, and I'm so sorry. But don't you ever think I don't want you around. I know, mom. It must be tough being alone. Especially at your age. [giggles] -Excuse me? -I'm just kidding. Look, you could change all that if you really wanted to. I can think of a few hot-looking guys who might go for a divorcee like you. Oh, thanks. No, thanks. I'm good. If I want a man, I'll, I'll find a man. -Uh-huh. -But forget about me. What about you? Anyone new and interesting in your world? Mom, no. College boys are way overrated. You can't trust any one of them out of your sight. Yeah, they're just like your dad. But let's face it. That's what keeps people like me in business. Speaking of which, I've been doing a lot of thinking lately and I've come to the conclusion that I think you need to investigate a new line of work. What? Why? Because this is dangerous. Sooner or later, you're gonna take a photograph of someone and it's gonna lead to a whole lot of trouble. What would you have me do? I don't know, maybe wedding photos or baby pictures. Baby pictures? It'll be a whole lot safer. [Samantha] They pay a whole lot less. You know, you're pretty expensive sometimes. [Laurie] That is so unfair. You know, I only have one more year of school left and after that, maybe you think about it. Okay, honey, I'll think about it, I promise but now, how 'bout a new dress? You don't have to twist my arm. Well, I'd like to... [cellphone buzzing] Yeah. Did you do what I asked you to? Good. [sighs] -Wish you didn't have to leave. -Gotta roll. You know what they say, "Time and taxes wait for no man." Well, you don't have to act so happy about it. Wow. You're starting to sound just like me. Hey, that's not fair. You're right. Mom, I'm sorry. You just seem so tensed lately like something's wrong. You're not holding out on me, are you? No. Of course not. Nothing's wrong. Nothing you wanna tell me about. Why? You can trust me, you know that. I know, it's just some things are better left out of the conversation. I'll work it out, honey, don't, don't worry. How can I not worry? You're the only child I have. One of these days, pow! Right to the moon. Oh, yeah? You and what army? [car horn honking] Oh, Carrie's here. Ugh, so soon? No, no, right on time. -Hi, Ms. Roberts. -Hi, Carrie. -Nice car. -Thanks. -My dad got it for me. -Oh. Let me get the trunk. [sighs] Hmm. There's not much room in here. I like to travel light. [sighs] Well, drive safely, and, um... don't pick up any strange boys. [giggles] Of course. I'll call you later. And if you wanna talk about what's bothering you please think of me. [chuckles] Okay, mom, I will. I will. Bye. Bye, guys. [car approaching] What, did you forget something? Not exactly. But I was hoping I could, uh, maybe talk to you. If you could spare the time. -Is this official? -Not yet. I just thought maybe you could help me with something. Sort of, off the record. How much off the record? This much. Alright, you wanna come inside, I guess. Nah, I was hoping we could go get a cup of coffee. I know this great little cafe down the road. Yeah, I know that place. Alright, well, I'll get my purse. Great. Mm. They make a damn fine cup of coffee here. Yeah, I hear they grind their own beans. So, how do you even know this place? 'Cause this is, um, a little out of your territory. Unless, what? They give freebies to cops or something? Mm, I wouldn't know. I'm strictly plain clothes, remember? Oh, that's right. You're a detective. That sounds so important. I guess it's better than wearing one of those uniforms all day. Never discount the value of the uniform of the officer, Ms. Roberts. They're the backbone of the entire force. My father wore a uniform. Oh! Is he retired? No. He didn't make it that far. Oh, I'm so sorry. It's okay. He lived the life that he wanted. Thank you. Mm, everybody knows the risks. Listen, since we're being all unofficial and everything call me Sam. Alright, Sam. Let me get right to this. You were staking out Sheila Grant for a reason. I wanna know what it was. Look, like I said-- No, I-I, please. You're a professional photographer, right. No picture, no pay. And I understand the whole concept of confidentiality but a woman was murdered. I need your help. Well, I don't wanna send you down the wrong path. So, you do have an idea of who she might have been with. Maybe. Look, these pictures are more than a little risque but... if you don't mind takin' a look. [Samantha] Wow. Wow, you're not kiddin'. Can you recognize anyone? Well, yeah, I recognize her. But none of the guys? No. Sorry. Your client was the only person that we can link directly to Sheila Grant. Look, it was a last-minute assignment. I don't... I wish I could help you. Ask my boss. He'll know. Hmm. I intend to. I guess I was just hoping for a faster solution. [clears throat] Well, you should have plied me with something stronger than coffee and donuts. I will. If there's a next time. I'd like that. What's this all about? I'm not sure. Why should I believe you? What's that supposed to mean? I don't know, but I plan to find out. -What's going on here? -Officer, what's this all about? What is going on? Why are you in my house? -Oh, Matt. -Tom? What are you doin' here? Search warrant. Signed by Judge Evans. What? This is ridiculous! On what grounds? Probable cause, ma'am. Assume a little, Matt. -Who pushed this through? -I did. We're gonna talk about this later. Oh, my God. Good cop, bad cop. -Is that it? Hmm? -What? You lure me away from my house, so your men can turn it upside down? God, I'm so stupid. "I know a nice cafe down the road." Wait, you don't think that I had anything to do with this. -Do you? -Please! You won't get away with this, I have my rights! [whispers] Excuse me. Sam, believe me, okay? I didn't know about this. God, I'm so glad my daughter isn't here to see this. Unless, maybe, you had her picked up on the way outta town? Trust me, I'm gonna get to the bottom of it. Matt. You should take a look at this. Does this belong to you? -No. -It's been fired three times. Th-th-it's, that's not my gun! We found this in the back of your dressing drawers, ma'am. That is crazy! I have never seen that gun in my life! Sheila Grant was shot three times with... a 38. I told you! It's not mine! Oh, my God. I don't believe this, you're tying to pin this on me. If this is the gun that killed Miss Grant we're gonna find out. [exhales] I told you it was not mine. But I know whose it is. Okay... Whose is it? It's his. [Samantha] He killed her. -Detective Walker? -Yeah. I wasn't sure at first, but I am now. He's the one I saw getting out of the car last night. I hope you know what you're saying. It's a very serious accusation, ma'am. All things considered. Consider this. Have your boys fire that up. He's wearing glasses in the photos but I know it's him. I thought you said you didn't get anything last night. So, I made a mistake. Look at it. I will. Are you guys all through here? [Tom] Yeah, I think so. Gents, let's wrap it up. We're gonna have to take her laptop as well. Yeah, understood. Look, I'm sorry, Sam, but, uh... I might have to take you in. What? I don't-I don't believe this. Mike, would you escort the lady out to your car? Yes, sir. Let's go, ma'am. -Oh! -Come with me. [exhales] I have a good lawyer! You're gonna need one. Hey. Everything in order? Oh, yeah. Yeah, you do great work. In fact, it's prefect. Right down to the last letter. Now, you mind telling me what the hell this is all about? I'm not sure what you mean. But you look angry. Oh, you think so? Since when does my own partner go around me for a search warrant? You don't even ask me about this before you act? Look, Matt... I'm sorry, but I tried to contact you you never got back to me, and you weren't here, alright? [Tom] I was concerned that there was a-a vital evidence that might be destroyed. So, we had to act fast. So... I made a decision. Vital evidence? Alright, wh-what put that thought in your head? Come on, we're cops, alright? The, uh, blank SD card that we found in her camera? She tricked us, alright? 'Cause no pro would have missed that. Now, why would she do that? If she didn't have something to hide? Okay, keep going. Well, do the math, what do you do when someone is tryin' to hide evidence from you? You get a search warrant, right? No, no, you call me and we talk about it. And then, if we both agree we go forward. Look, Matt... I'm sorry if you think that I was trying to go around your back. I didn't mean to, alright? I just felt that, that somebody had to act fast. Now, maybe, maybe I, uh, jumped to conclusions. But maybe not. Just don't go behind my back, period. Okay? I don't care what the circumstances are. Look, I apologize! Alright? I did try to contact ya. Couldn't locate you. I mean, where the hell were you anyway? Huh? I was followin' up on a hunch. A hunch? And you didn't share it with your partner. In the meantime, look what we did get, alright? [inhales] She did have another SD card despite what she said, and that gun... now, it might take a couple of days to confirm this but I bet you a dollar to a donut that that is the gun that killed Sheila Grant. Alright, maybe. But it still doesn't make sense. Why would a photographer get involved in a murder? A single mother? Her daughter home for the weekend? Just doesn't add up. And it doesn't add up that she accuses me of murder. But it happened. Alright? Face it, pal. The woman's grasping at straws here. I just don't think she could have done it. Hey. [Tom] Get real, Matt. Anybody, and I do mean anybody is capable of murder at any time, under the right circumstances and you, of all people, should know that. Yeah, you're right. Okay, but I'm still not convinced that Samantha... I just don't buy it. You hear yourself? Samantha? Huh. Listen to me. You're my partner. You're my best friend. And I love you like a brother. But remember this, and please do not take this the wrong way but we are cops first. Don't forget that. Yeah. You don't need to remind me. Where you goin'? I got somethin' important I need to take care of. [telephone ringing] West Coast. Joe, listen up, it's Sam. I'm in jail, and I have one phone call. What's the charge? They think I killed Sheila Grant. That's ridiculous, you couldn't kill anyone. It's gotta be that guy in the photographs. Yeah, I know, but they found this gun in my house and it does not look good for me but it's not my gun, I swear! You don't have to convince me, Sam. [Joe] Okay, what do you need me to do? I need you to call my lawyer, J.L. Jacobs and tell him to get down here as soon as he can. J.L. Jacobs. Okay. What about Laurie? No, no, I don't want to worry her until I know how this thing's gonna play out. Alright, anything else? Those photos I gave you, I'm gonna need the prints back. -What? -Yeah, I lost my memory card. And I have a pretty good idea it's gonna be wiped clean. Those prints might be the only proof of who really killed Sheila Grant. Sam, I don't have them anymore. I turned all the prints over to the client, Reynolds. That's our policy. And we don't keep copies. I know, I know, okay, I'm just gonna have to get it from him, I guess. Directly. You can try. He's at 555, Courtney Lane. Okay. Alright, thanks. Hey, Sam. Hang tough. You'll be outta there in no time. Joe Johnson? -Can I help you? -I'm Detective Tom Walker. Robbery Homicide. You have a minute? Sure, what can I do for you? We have a, uh, woman that we're holding and, uh, she said that she'd done some surveillance work for your agency recently. Name is, uh, Samantha Roberts. [Tom] You know her? -Samantha Roberts? -Mm-hmm. She does some, uh, freelance for us. Once in a while. Uh, recently? Recently, uh... maybe. Did she, by chance, drop off some photographs to you yesterday? Maybe. I would really love to look at those photographs. They could be very important for our case. Sorry, I don't have them anymore. I mean, sir, they-they-they might help prove her case and her innocence. I'm sure it would, but we sent the only copies to our client. And it's our policy not to keep any duplicates. Well... that is a very good policy to have, sir. Well, I'll tell you what. You just give me your client's name I'll contact him myself. No can do, if I compromise my client my business won't be worth a dime. Never have. Never will. You're saying you, you can't help me, sir? Let's just say I won't help you. Ha, and, uh... nothing I could say, or do, would change your mind? What do you think? [chuckles] I think you're... you're a tough guy, sir. Uh... One last question, if I might. Did you, by any chance, look at those photographs? I did. That is a shame. [gunshot] I'm very sorry you made me do that, sir. But that's the trouble with integrity. Comes at such a... high price. You don't have to answer these questions if you don't want to. They can't force you. That's alright, let's just get on with this. Thank you. Now, we already know that you have a concealed carry permit. And there's a 38 J-frame revolver registered to you. Yeah, a lot of people in my line of work have something like that. And that's not the gun that killed Sheila Grant. We know. We checked. What we found in your residence is what we call a throwdown. An unregistered weapon that you're supposed to throw down and walk away from, after you use it. That's true, and if I had done that you boys couldn't have planted it in my house. Yes. Yeah, you said it. And why do you have my underwear in there? They were wrapped around this. A thousand dollars in cash. Don't get excited, J, it's just my fee for staking out Sheila. A thousand dollars? Yeah, a thousand dollars, what, does that seem too... what? Little? Too much? Uh, that depends. On... oh, right. 'Cause you think I killed Sheila for a thousand dollars! Really, I'm not that cheap. I didn't say you were. Just take me to dinner sometime. You'll find out. And what about... this? Yeah, that's mine. Joe gave it to me to ID her. Because scoping out the wrong person would be counterproductive. And you still maintain that Detective Tom Walker is the man you saw with Sheila Grant last night? Yeah. At first, I wasn't sure. But now that I know he's planted all this stuff in my house to frame me yeah, he's your guy. Look, I've known Detective Walker for years. He has a spotless record. A family. I think I would know if he-- Oh, please, I'm sure every one of those sorry bastards in those photos that you found had a spotless record. That's what they wanna protect! I mean, anyone can find themselves in a tight spot especially if they have help. Don't say too much, Samantha. Just-just stick with a yes or a no answer. Why? So they can just fill in everything that I don't say? Look, Ms. Roberts, I want you to be innocent. Please believe me. You've a funny way of showing it. Help me help you. [sighs] Just... just look at the card, okay? Just look at the card, and tell me who is innocent. We already looked at it. -And? -It was blank. Just like the other card you gave us. Why did I know you were gonna say that? Don't you see? It's perfect. Walker was in my house before we got there. He just switched my card out with a blank one, and waited for me to make a fool of myself. Do you have a backup? No, I-I don't. I didn't get a chance. [exhales] Hey, can I keep those? I've a feeling that I'd be here for a while. Look, don't worry, Samantha. Someone arranged your bail. You can leave as soon as we're done here. Go on. I-I can't hold you. Better luck next time. [clears throat] Okay. Alright, well, thanks for the hospitality, guys. I'll, uh, come back when I can stay longer. Thank you, my dear. Keys, and phone is dead. You think you could've charged it, fellas. By the way, who posted my bail? I think you know Mr. Roberts. [sighs] Oh, no. Thought you'd be a little happier to see me under the circumstances. I could've taken care of my own bail. I do own a house. [scoffs] How could I forget? I paid for it. Ah, that's right. Well, if you'll excuse me I've gotta get back to the office. Run while you can. Call me later. He contacted me, and said you were in trouble. What would you expect me to do? Rescue me, that's what all the great ex-husbands do. [sighs] Can we not argue here? I covered your bail. I'm not looking for any thanks. Isn't that enough? Yeah. I'm sorry, Jim. I just... It's been very stressful. They think I killed someone last night. That's insane! Why would they think that? Because they found the murder weapon in my house. What? Are you serious? Yeah, someone planted it. -Does Laurie know? -No. I'll tell her when I know what's going on. Don't wait too long, this will find its way into the news sooner than later. Well, thanks for the advice. Are we done? Yeah, I guess so. Mr. Roberts, they're ready for you to sign off on the bail agreement. Alright. I hope you work this out. I will. Thanks. Thank you. No problem. Oh, God. Oh, my God. [clears throat] You need a ride? [Samantha] Uh... Y-y-yeah, I do. But... not from you. Wait, why not? Well... officially, you're enemy number one. And, uh, B, isn't that a conflict of interest? Not for me. I just recused myself from your case. You did? Why? Too much familiarity with the person of interest. -You mean me? -That's correct. Yeah, so, how about that ride? I mean, I was headed your way already, so... Whoa! That's convenient. And it's true. I'm pretty much done here. And, look at that. It's almost happy hour. And you know a great little place. Where have I heard that before? It's the best offer you're gonna get today. Yeah, no kidding. [inhales] [exhales] Okay. I could use a drink. You're buying. Mr. Roberts. -Yeah. -Phyllis, what do we have here? Uh, his paperwork. Here, let me see. Yeah, I'll take care of that, okay? Okay? -Oh, yes, sir. -Thank you. Alright. Here, why don't we get you to sign this right now? It's for your wife's release. -Ex-wife. -Ex-wife, oh. Well, then, she's very lucky to have you, uh, bail her out. [scoffs] Well, don't tell her that. She still hates me. [laughs] Exes, huh? Yeah, they're a lot like head colds. It's hard to shake 'em, but when you finally do they still kinda stick around. [laughs] Women are very complicated creatures, that is for sure. Like my father always said "Women, you can't live with 'em and you sure as hell can't shoot 'em." [laughter] -You said it. -Hey, you have a great day. -Alright? Alright. -Thanks. [cellphone ringing] Dad? What's wrong? What makes you think there's something wrong? You wouldn't be calling if there wasn't. Alright, you got me. Uh... Your mom was just released from City Jail. -City Jail? -She's fine. But she really needs you right now. Can you go home for a few days? I just left there, but yeah I could probably talk Carrie into dropping me off. Okay, good, I just don't think she should be alone right now. I can be there in an hour. Perfect. Yeah. She'll really appreciate it. Alright, better get movin'. You know, sometimes, it really does just pay to mind your own business, Matt. I should have left when Joe told me to. And I was about to, when your guys showed up. Hey, that part still puzzles me. What? How fast the officers arrived at the scene. You said that someone reported a prowler a... neighbor. No, I-I know, but checking it out there's no record of that actually happening. I'm not sure anybody did really report it. At least, not outside the department. That's what I've been saying. It's Walker. I-I... He probably phoned it in the minute he ditched her car. Yeah, but why? I mean, he didn't even know that you were there. Maybe he didn't maybe he did. I mean, that was perfect timing to set me up. There's just one catch. I didn't have any motive. I barely even knew who Grant was. Yeah, but hypothetically, you could have been paid by one of her blackmail targets, to get rid of her. Well, hypothetically. But if you believe that we wouldn't be sitting here, right now. Hypothetically, you're absolutely right. Here you go. Thank you, you wanna get a table? Yeah. [laughs] -Oh, my God. -That's... Look at me. Do I look like a hitman? [scoffs] -No. -Ha-ha-ha. Of course not. And I like you. I like you a lot. But I just... I'm having trouble wrapping my head around this whole Walker thing. [sighs] Matt. If you like me, look into this. Look into his alibi. Or better yet, look into his bank account. If he was a target, you're gonna see big chunks of money leaving that account. Unless, of course, he was a partner. -Wait, a partner? -Yeah. Who better than him to get the inside track on people's dirty laundry? Hell, in his position, he could create dirty laundry where there wasn't any. Uh, I don't follow. Okay, imagine a married guy, okay? Couple of kids, happily married. He gets set up with a fake prostitute. Sheila Grant. Walker busts him in the act. And then, decides, out of the goodness of his heart not to book 'em. But that hook has been set. And that guy's whole world is on the line. You do realize you're talking about one of our finest detectives here, right? Will you face it? Walker could have been a target. Then, he could have been forced to reel in the others. Yeah, and how are you you gonna prove that? I mean, it's your word against his since you don't have the photographs. Who says I don't? Well, well, you said. I didn't have a backup. But someone else might. Can we go? I need to get home. Yeah. [engine rumbling] The lights are on. [exhales] Oh, maybe the, uh, officers left them on. Yeah, maybe. Would you mind coming inside for a few minutes while I looked around? I'd be happy to. [sighs] Okay. Don't get any ideas. [door creaks] Do your guys usually leave the front door unlocked when they're done raiding a place? No, they don't. You want me to, uh check it out to make sure we're alone? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Be careful. [door creaks] [scoffs] Nice work, boys. Very neat, very tidy. Hope everyone had fun. [exhales] Oh. [Samantha exhales] -Well? -Ha. Well, it's a huge mess. But, you know, everything seems alright. [inhales] Good. [sighs] My daughter would say "Clean up your room," right about now. -Um... -Laurie. Right, you know. She seems like a very well-adjusted young lady. -Yes. -You must be very proud of her. Yes, I am. Yes, she is all I have. She's everything I wasn't. [inhales] It's amazing how she turned out as well as she did. It's a mystery. Well, she obviously had a very good teacher. Me? Yeah, hardly. I mean, yeah, maybe I taught by example. What not to be, I'm the one person you do not want your kids to be like. Oh, God, don't you think you're being a little too hard on yourself? Mm. You don't know me. Well, not, not well. Not yet, anyway. [laughs] Are, uh... all these yours? Yeah, these are, I put them up there just to remind myself that I used to have a vision. I used to think photography was, you know, an art form and... a way to express myself but now, it's just another tool. But it does, um, pay the bills and it puts Laurie through college, so... Well, they're very subtle. They leave you wanting more. I'll show you the rest another time. Not tonight, I got so much to clean up but I'm really tired. Yeah, of course. Yeah, well, you know. Call me if you need any-- I will. Hey, uh. Look into Walker. He's your man. Alright. But I'm still gonna need proof. I'll get you proof. And then you can do your thing. You got it. Well, goodnight. Good night. Thanks. -Lock this door. -I will. [sighs] Trouble, trouble. [instrumental music] [music continues] [sighs] [music continues] [gasps] What the... You just couldn't leave... well enough alone, could you? You... What do you want? You had... every opportunity every chance to just... walk away from this. I still can. If you let me. [laughs] How could I do that? Hmm? You're an eyewitness. You have to bring me down... in order to save yourself, and I... I-I can't let that happen. I don't have the photos. You do. And it's your word against mine. And my word is... so much better than yours, right? Yes, that's what I'm thinking. Yeah. Well, now that you've... thrown all this suspicion on me... Now that my... my best friend, my partner... is looking into my past digging... how long do you think it's gonna take? A day? A week? A month? Maybe even longer. But... he will eventually get there. Because he's that good. And... He likes you. No, Ms. Roberts. You have ruined me. You've ruined my career. [Tom] You've ruined my... marriage. And you've ruined my life. So now I've no choice but to... ruin you. You can't just kill me. No, I don't plan to. You're gonna commit suicide... tonight, with this. It's a tragedy, really. The two of you had such a promising future ahead of you. The photographs... There's another set out there. They'll finish you. If... they ever turn up. See, I'm thinking that whoever has them... is just so damn... glad to be out from under the hammer of blackmail... that they'll just never surface. They'll just... disappear. Mom? Mom? [gasps] Hey! [grunting] Argh! Ah! Ugh! [gunshot] Mom? [grunting] Ugh. Argh. [groans] [screams] Come here. [grunts] [screams] [crying] Get away from me! [whimpers] [groans] Laurie! [Matthew] This is Matt. Matt... Matt, come quick, please. -What's wrong? -Just hurry. [Matt] I'm on my way. Laurie! Are you sure you don't want to go to the hospital? Yeah, I'm alright. -Uh, you don't look alright. -I'm okay. -You got it? -Yeah, I got it. Oh, God, it was him. He was here waiting for me. [Matt] Look, are you positive that it was Walker? I mean, it was dark, could it have been anybody else? When are you gonna accept that your partner wants to kill me? I mean, we talked, he... he tried to shoot me. -And then Laurie came in. -Wait, Laurie? Yeah, I don't even know what she was doing here. Well, ha-have you talked to her? No. I haven't known what to say. Do you know where she is now? I hope she got away. Yeah, me too. Hey, get on the horn. And see if you can raise up Detective Walker. Let me know if you do. And don't say anything about this. Yes, sir. Hey, if he's out there... we're gonna find him. Do you think he got her? I don't know. You just keep trying her on her cell, alright? [Matt] Maybe she'll answer. Right now, I need to go follow up on some leads. Are you gonna be okay? Yeah. I'll leave an officer behind just in case he comes back. Matt... Yeah? Be careful, please. [sighs] [Matt] When's the last time you heard from Tom? Uh, it was the day before yesterday. [female #1] He called to tell me he was working late. [Matt] And what time was that? Seven-thirty. He seemed like he was in a hurry. What's going on, Matt? I'm not sure, exactly. Not yet, anyway. Has Tom been acting, uh... different lately? Different? Yeah, you know, uh, nervous, anxious? Uh, anything unusual? Anything... that you can't explain? Well, that's hard to say, Matt he hasn't been around much. He hasn't been coming home at night? He was on stake-out all last week. And then... He told me he was on an important assignment with you. I didn't think to question him, why would I? No reason. [Matt] We're trying to account for some lost time. It's been hard to confirm his whereabouts. You mean, you don't know where he is? We haven't seem or heard from Tom since early this morning. And... you haven't either? No... he hasn't called home at all. He usually does, this is not like him. There's a lot of things going on right now that don't seem like Tom. Is... he in trouble? I don't know. Hey, can you do something for me? If I can. Can you check your online bank account? Alright. What would I be looking for? I'll know when I see it. Please come to the den. [keys clacking] I usually leave all the banking to Tom. You know, we each have our own little duties to do around the house. Tom likes to handle the finances. I understand. Gosh, it's been forever since I've logged onto this account. I'd forget the password if it wasn't the date Tom and I got married. [female #1] Here it is. Anything jumping out at you? Not that I can see. What about the savings account? Do you have one of those? Yeah, I'd almost forgotten about that. The savings account is empty. How can that be? It's been drained. A large withdrawal every three weeks for the past... four months. Can you explain that? I'm sorry, but I just can't. What does this mean? [sighs] I can't say right now. Did-did Tom ever gamble? No. Drugs? Of course not, you know Tom, he's not the type. Yeah, of course. [phone buzzing] [clears throat] Excuse me. This is Matt. Okay. [sighs] Yeah, I got it. [Matt] I'm on my way. Margaret, please let me know right away if he calls you. I'd like to help him if I can. And please don't say that I was here. Can't you tell me anything? I'm sorry, but... I can't right now. [phone buzzing] [Samantha] Oh, my God. Laurie. Baby, where are you? Mama, please help me. I will, I will, just tell me where you are. She's right here with me... [Tom] Ms. Roberts. Safe and sound. Snug as a bug. What have you done to my daughter? Nothing... yet. Now, what happens next that's completely up to you. What do you want? Samantha, please. Do not act stupid. You know exactly what I want. [Tom] I want those photographs. Now... I am losing my patience here. I-I can get them, I just need a little time. That's just how much time your daughter has, very little. Don't hurt her, she has nothing to do with this. I know, I know, this is all very unfortunate. But I have faith that we can work all of this out. Now, you know what I want. How do we make this happen? I can get them, I'll get them first thing in the morning. Good, you do that, and once you do you call Laurie's phone and I 'll give you the next step. Okay, just don't hurt her. The only people that I ever hurt... are people that tried to hurt me. But in your daughter's case... I might make an exception. Now, are we good? Yeah, we're good. And Samantha... Don't involve Matt in this. I'd really hate to see something bad happen to him. Okay. Okay. [sighs] [Tom] Easy, Laurie, easy. There you go. This might be over... real soon. As long as your mom doesn't... do something stupid. You know... I really... I really don't wanna hurt you. I never wanted to hurt anybody. Let me show you this. You see her? That is my Margaret. Best damn woman any guy could ever want. And she's never given me any trouble. Waits on me hand and foot, gave me two beautiful kids... but... I wasn't satisfied. Guys never are. And... I screwed up... and... you make one more bad decision. One bad decision... after another. And down the rabbit hole you go. You know what I'm talking about? Yeah. I thought you might. You know... you remind me of my daughter... [chuckles] except she talks a lot more than you. [indistinct radio chatter] -Anything moved? -No. We haven't disturbed anything, except to check to see if the victim was still alive. He's not. You're a little out of your jurisdiction, aren't you, Matt? Consider me an interested party. Hm. -Anything missing? -Well, that's hard to say. This place is a mess. They could have taken something. They could have torn the whole place up. Who knows? How do you make it? Eh, single shot. If I had to guess, nine millimeter. Through the doorway. Yeah, a guy in his line of work probably makes a few enemies along the way. [man] There's not a lot to go on here, Matt. Do you mind? Don't get me in trouble now. [Matt] Doesn't feel like a robbery. -I wonder what the motive was. -I think I might know. -Can I help you? -Hi. Is, uh, Mr. Reynolds home? It's kind of early. Is he expecting you? Well, no, but it's kind of important. -Please. -Alright. Come on in. I'll let him know you're here. [sighs] -Can I help you? -My name is Sam Roberts. I'm with West Coast Confidential. What do you want? Uh, I'm the one who took those photos. I thought our business was finished. It was, now someone's been killed and I need the photos back. I paid a lot of money to get those photos. I can get you your money back, but I need the photos. No, I-I'm sorry, but I can't help you. Look, the woman who's been blackmailing you she is dead, okay? It's all over, it's ended but those photos show who killed her and so if I can't get it back I'm gonna have to tell the police where to come find 'em. Can you keep me out of this? Yeah. Wait here. -Yeah. -I have the photos. Good, good, I knew you could do it if you put your mind to it. Now what? I'll make it easy on you. 11:30 a.m. at the Promenade at Central Mall. Be there and we'll make the trade. -11:30? -Be alone. I will, but so help me, if you hurt my daughter-- Just be there. Ah, I'm probably gonna hate myself for this. -Good morning, detective. -Good morning. -Any word on Walker? -Nothing yet. -Did you try callin' his house? -We did. His wife says she hasn't heard from him. Hm. Alright. Keep a man posted out front and let me know if that APB turns up anything. -Yes, sir. -I need a lead. [cell phone buzzing] Come on. It's far enough. -Laurie, are you okay? -I'm okay. Do you have the photographs? Put 'em on that table and step away. Alright, step back. That's right. Come on. Yeah. That's right. That's your gun. That would be tragic, wouldn't it? [mumbles] [sighs] No copies, right? Hand her over. I will. Ah. -As soon as we get to Mexico. -Mexico? I'll let her go somewhere in the Rosarito Beach area. -She can call you from there. -What? It's about a four-hour drive with traffic. Just go home and you wait by the phone and you wait for it to ring. You bastard! You have no idea... no idea what I've had to go through... but I don't expect you to. Nobody should have to endure what I've had to endure. Sheila Grant... she got what was coming to her. She ruined a lot of lives. She was an evil woman and she needed to die... except there's just one teeny little problem. You came alone. Now... I have lost everything... my money, my career. I've lost my wife, my family. I got nothing left to lose. So, lady, please, don't make me kill you. [grunting] -Ah. -Come on. Move. [woman screaming] Police! Out of the way! Back out of the way, lady. Stand away! -Oh, my God. -Get out of the way. Stop right there, Tom. [panting] Matt. Drop the gun and put your hands behind your head. -Alright, alright, buddy. -Please. Alright, buddy, d-don't shoot. I'm gonna drop it. [gunshot] See what you made me do? [siren wailing] [chuckles] I guess Mexico's out of the question now. Now it's a shame. [gun clicks] [siren wailing] J-Frame has only five rounds. -Mom, are you okay? -Yes, yes, honey. Go get help. [Matt groaning] -Alright. Everybody alright? -Yes, yes, except for you. [chuckles] Uh, it's nothing two doctors can't patch up. -I've seen worse. -You have? Yeah, on TV. Late-night show. Shh, just be quiet. I'm gonna take you to a great little place I know. -Oh, yeah? Where's that? -The hospital. [laughs] Okay. Ha. [Matt groaning] Here's to a bright new career as the department's first female police photographer. Sounds so important. I hope I don't embarrass you. I don't think you could even if you tried. Don't challenge her, Matt. She can't resist a challenge. Quiet, you. Let's remember who saved whose life. Alright, stop bragging. Lunch is served. -Whoa. -Wow. Beef salad with goat cheese. Nice. What a starter. Yes, Laurie is trying to reinvent my entire diet. Can I get a smile? Eat all your vegetables and you'll get a smile. Would you rather duck out for a cheeseburger and some fries? I know a great little place. Yeah, I would but we can't because she worked so hard on this. -So I'll tell you what? -What? I'll take a rain check. ♪ ♪
