(grandiose musical movement) - Night, in a high vaulted, narrow, Gothic den, Faust, restless in his arm chair at the desk. Faust. I have alas, studied philosophy, jurisprudence, and medicine too, and worst all theology, with keen endeavor through and through, and here I am for all my lore, the retched fool I was before. Called master of arts and doctor to boot for 10 years almost I confute, and up and down, wherever it goes, I drag my students by the nose, and see that for all our science and art we can know nothing. It burns my heart. Of course I am smarter than all the shysters, the doctors, and teachers, and scribes, and Christers, and no scruple or doubt could make me ill. I am not afraid of the Devil or Hell. - Doctor Miles, do you believe that we can know nothing? - If I believed that, there would be no reason for this class. (class laughing) Okay, over the semester break pick up the novel. Sorry, I see I've already robbed you of five precious minutes of your vacation time. Well ladies and gentlemen, study hard over the break and I will see you next term.

I have to meet with Carl Kleinman. He wants to see me before I head home. - Oh Stephen, I hope it's not gonna be one of those long, drawn out political meetings. - June, he just wants to see me for a few minutes, okay? - Okay. - [Stephen] Goodbye. - Bye. Oh, Stephen wait. Could you pick up a few things for me at the market on your way home? - June, why can't you do this? - [June] Stephen, it's right on your way, and I've been busy all day trying to reach dad. (seismic rumbling) Stephen? Are you still there? - Yeah, yes, I'm still here. - [June] Listen, I'm gonna get off the phone right now. I wanna try to reach dad again. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. What do you want me to pick up? - Oh, I can't think now. - [Stephen] Look, June... - Um, okay okay wait. Do you have a pencil and paper? - June, I am at a pay phone. Just tell me what you want, I'll remember. - [June] Okay, milk, bread, eggs, flashlight batteries, caffeinated coffee, hamburger, flashlight batteries. - You said flashlight batteries. Look, I've really gotta run. - [June] Okay. - See you in a bit. - [June] Okay, please don't be too late. (door knocking) - Come in. Oh Steve, come on it. Sorry about the mess. - Well, are they finally moving you up to the penthouse? - [Carl] No, I'm moving out. - Out? - O.U.T. out. I've been axed. - What? I don't believe it. - They had to cut things to the bone. So I guess somebody's head had to roll. - Carl, I'm sorry. Is there anything I can do? Talk to the president? Oh, what a rotten thing to do. - Steve I'm alright, really. Can't say I'm overjoyed about it, but, well, the university has very little choice with the economic conditions being what they are. And that brings me to why I asked to see you. Here, sit down. Well the regions met, it's final. The coming term is canceled, lack of funders. - Well you can't cancel a university like this. - Oh they can, and they have. Now it's probably just for one term, but if I were you, I'd take the time to look around just in case. Though, chances are the money squeeze will soon be over and classes will resume. They may even move you into this office. - Carl, I could hardly fill your shoes. - You're a brilliant teacher and they know it. Not some old fuddy duddy like me caught up in esoteric research as the regions call it. No, they're not going to lightly throw away a talent like yours. - Well what are you going to do? - Oh I have my papers and my research. No one's depending on me and what I can't take care of, God can. Oh I know, you think I'm out of touch with reality, off in some religious never, never land. - No it's not that Carl. - No it's alright, I understand perfectly, but I also know what I know, and God is a reality. Some day you're going to agree with me on that point. You're just too honest a man not to. (laughing) Which reminds me, I too have a favor to ask of you if I might. It's not much, but it would mean a great deal to me. - Sure, whatever I can do to help. - Now I know this is not your cup of tea, but I need a sharp critical mind to examine this. Now feel free to make any suggestions. Your comments will be invaluable. - Well Carl, you're the expert on this kind of stuff. You know that I don't believe in a literal interpretation of the Bible. But I will look at it, and I assure you that I will be a very good critic. - Well, that's all I ask. That is all-- (seismic rumbling) - Boy that one really had some bite to it, you know-- Carl? Carl? Carl? Carl? Carl, you in there? Carl? Oh! - Oh, hello Doctor Miles. That was quite a shaker we had, huh? - Yeah, you haven't seen Doctor Kleinman have you? - No. No, I haven't, but he usually goes home about this time. - Well his car's still out in the lot. Look, if he shows up, would you tell him that I had to go on home. - No problem. I'd be glad to. (mysterious music) Good evening Doctor Miles. - Uh huh, good night. - Excuse me, have you seen a little girl with blonde hair and a blue coat? - No, sorry. - [Angry Woman] Leave your kid at home next time lady! - That's $20! - [Man] Hey, break it up, will ya? - [Angry Woman] I've gotta get home! (angry yelling and commotion) - Wait a minute. That's more than double the marked price. - Read the sign lady. Do you want the eggs or not? - Yeah I want the eggs. What a rip off. - I just work here. If you wanna cry rip off, yell at the government. - Come on, are we gonna fight or are we gonna check out groceries? - [Man] Let's keep it moving. - That'll be $189.65 with tax. - [Man] He was here first. Give me a break! - Thanks a lot. - [Man] This is the last time I'm coming in here. (angry crowd murmuring) (sad disparaging music) - Well, where have you been? - What does this look like, a bowling ball? - Oh very funny. - Yeah, not half as funny as being unemployed. - What? - Next term has been canceled. - Canceled? - That's what Kleinman wanted to see me about. He's been axed and I have been laid off, and I never wanna go into this supermarket again. - [June] Well what are we going to do? - Beats me. That last shock do any damage? - Yes. - [Stephen] Oh swell, what? - Me. Stephen, I can't handle these quakes anymore. - Honey... - I wanna go to dad's. - Oh no, I am no mood to be preached at. That is the last thing I need! Besides, I'm sure there's just as much quake activity at your dad's as there is here. - Well that's what I'm afraid of. - Call him on the phone again. - I've been calling him. I've been so concerned since that last shock. - Boy, Kleinman sure scooted out after that. - What? - He was there one minute, gone the next. - Stephen, you're not listening to me. - I am, I am. You said that, you couldn't reach your dad. - That's right, and I'm worried about him. The operator says the phone's working okay, but he's not answering. - June, honey, he's probably out in the barn, tinkering around with that old pickup. - Stephen please, there's nothing holding us here, and with the next term being canceled, I don't see why not-- - [Stephen] We are not going up to the farm. - Stephen, we have been telling daddy for the last few weeks, as soon as we had an opportunity to go-- - We are not going up to the farm. (laughing) - Hey bud, hey! (loud commotion and yelling) (horn honking) (car revving) (frantic music) (engine failure) - What's wrong? - How many times have I told you, when you use the gas can to fill it back up? - I forgot. - There isn't an open gas station within 10 miles of here. - Stephen, it was just a mistake. - I don't care what it was! - I'm sorry. - Sorry is not gonna get us to the farm. Hey! Hey, hey! - [June] Stephen, it's daddy. Daddy, it's me! We were just... Oh. You're not my father. - No, no I think I would've remembered that. - Well this is my dad's pickup. Where's my father? - This truck belongs to a guy named Don Goodwin. - I know that. - Hello. - [Man] How you doing? - Who are you? - My name is Gary Reed. I work for Don. - Oh, oh, I'm Stephen Miles. - [Gary] How do you do? - This is my wife June, Don's daughter. - Oh yeah, yeah he's mentioned you before. Hi. - Hi. - Gary? - [Gary] Yeah? - We were just on our way up to the farm and we ran out of gas. You wouldn't happen to have any extra, would you? - No, no but Don's got some back at the farm. Why don't you two hop in. I'll give you a ride. - Well, I'm a little concerned about leaving the car. - Oh just lock it up. We'll go get the gas and come right back. - Well, okay. I'll get the bags. - [Gary] Can I give you a hand? - No, no, no. - Hop in. The truck's not too clean, but it'll beat spending the night out here. - Daddy! - Can I grab those other bags? - Yeah. - Daddy? Daddy guess who? - [Radio Broadcaster] However there was no forecast. - Dad are you here? - [Radio Broadcaster] However late this afternoon. The latest reports are-- - Daddy where are you? - [Radio Broadcaster] Throughout the city. - Daddy, where are you? - [Radio Broadcaster] Unusual seismic activity. Unlike normal quake activity, this latest tremor had no detectable epicenter. - I'll go check out in the barn. - Okay. - [Radio Broadcaster] World wide. And having no apparent focal point. - Don? (dark foreboding music) (thunder clapping) Don? Don? (gasping) Hey, hey! (screaming) - No! Please, no! Please! (struggling) (thunder clapping) - [Radio Broadcaster] Reports continue to stream in of strange disappearance of people. There have been numerous related accidents. Both the law enforcement agencies are asking for cooperation and answering calls of incidents, asking that only emergencies dial the 9/11 exchange. Other reports are being handled as usual. - Stephen, I can't find-- (shushing) - [Radio Broadcaster] One late report is yet unconfirmed, takes an even more bizarre twist. Numerous graves are reported to have been disturbed, broken open, and now seem empty. Similar reports are now filtering in from across the national news wire. We'll have more on that later. - She was out in the barn. - Who is she? - She wouldn't say anything. - What's your name? What are you doing here? - Cindy, but I didn't do anything wrong. I was just looking for Mister Goodwin, but he's gone. They're all gone! - Who's gone? - Momma and daddy, and Mister Goodwin. They're gone. God took them away! - What do you mean God took them? - He took them. They were there and now they're gone. - Cindy, I'm sure there must be some rational explanation for this. - I saw it with my own eyes. They were there, and now they're gone. (crying softly) (mysterious music) - Kleinman... - Oh God. - Kleinman... June, June! - What's going on? Her mother. Her mother's grave!

(dark mysterious music) (police siren blaring) - Good morning officer. - Let's see your license. - Is there something wrong? - Half the country's in a panic, or haven't you noticed? Oh, out of state, huh? - Yeah. - What are you doing in Don Goodwin's pickup? - Oh, I've been working with Don for the last few weeks out on the farm. - And who are you? - I'm Don Goodwin's son in law, Stephen Miles. Officer, I had to leave my car out on the highway last night. We went to pick it up this morning. It was completely stripped and burned out. - Oh, you're the one who abandoned your car on the highway last night? - Well not exactly. I ran out of gas and Gary here gave us a lift on out to the farm and we just didn't get back last night. - Well you can't expect us to watch over it all night you know? Especially when you didn't report it. - Well that's what I'm doing. - It's a bit late, don't you think? Let's see your license. - Well McKifer, I see you found yourself some strangers. What'd they do? Failed to register when they came into town? (laughing) - Why don't you mind your own business, huh? - Hey, you must be the young man helping Don out at the farm. - Yeah, that's right. - Well, Don told me he was gonna get some help. Glad to see it. Needed it for some time now. - That's for sure. - What'd you catch him doing McKifer? (laughing) - I'll have a wrecker pick up your car and take it over to the dump. - You're all heart McKifer. (laughing) How you doing? - A lot better now, thanks. I'm Gary Reed. - Pete, just call me Pete. - Stephen Miles. - Oh yeah, Don's son in law. - Right. - Yeah, I think I recall seeing you a time or two. Of course, I know June from years back. Say listen, I'd watch yourself around Jackson McKifer. He's the law, but I'm afraid too often he's a law unto himself. Local folk call him pug. - Pug? - Pug? Well, we appreciate the warning. - Can we give you a lift somewhere? - Nope, thanks anyway. I have my own ways of getting around. Be sure and tell Don, Pete said hello. - Pete, just remember Pete. (laughing) - That's a curious fellow. - Maybe we should've said something about Don being missing. - What would we say? He was sitting at the kitchen table and, slid out of his clothes and was gone? - You've got a point. - Behold, I tell you a mystery. The moment, in a twinkling of an eye we shall be changed. - What's that? - It's a Bible verse. - Yeah? - It's in this manuscript a colleague of mine wrote. Current events in Biblical and prophetic literature. - I never studied the Bible much. On the news this morning, they said that it was probably a hoax. That the radicle Christians had dug up the bodies of their friends and gone into hiding. - Do you believe that? - The Christians dug up the bodies of their friends and went into hiding? No. But then, I don't believe anything. (dark foreboding music) (murmuring commotion) - Ladies and gentlemen, the Prime Minister! (audience applauds) - We're ready mister Prime Minister, we're ready. - Is that good? - [Production Director] This way please. Alright, you're on mister Prime Minister. - Yes, I'm ready. - [Production Director] Quiet please! Alright, stand by. Five, four, three... - Good evening. In the past few months the world community has witnessed unparalleled devastation. Earthquakes and volcanoes have produced staggering losses in life and property. Many are still missing. Starvation has reached enormous proportions. Vandalism is rampant. Chaos has swept through the world's economic system, and we stand on the brink of a nuclear nightmare. The irony is that never before in all of history has there been a more promising moment. In the midst of our weakness and despair, man has found the way. Men of great courage and vision are coming together in a newfound order. Separation and segmentation must yield to unity on every continent and in every country. The east and west, the Jew and the Arab, the black, white, yellow, all men everywhere must unselfishly capture the vision of a global destiny that will result in a stable, and secure, new world order. The United Nations of Europe is setting the example for global unity. Our cities shall be rebuilt, the starving will be fed. - Oh Cindy, the bread. - [Prime Minister] Our economy can and will be restored. And once again, law shall be the land. - You know, I can't even remember the last I smelled fresh baked bread. (laughing) - [Prime Minister] We will come together. - My mother used to bake bread every Friday when I was a little girl. I'd sit up on the counter, and I'd watch her fold the dough and kneed it, and sprinkle flour on it. I can't say I thought it was all that exciting then though. - Did you grow up on this farm? - Yes I did, but you know, I couldn't wait to head for big city, and that's where I met Stephen, and I thought all my dreams had come true. I guess you weren't raised in this area, were you? - Oh no, I grew up in Portland. My daddy worked on the docks. We always wanted to live on a farm, but we never could afford one until about three years ago, and that's when daddy finally bought one. It was right before I went into college. You know, they used to always talk about God and Jesus so much, I thought they were crazy. Oh, I guess they were right. - Well Stephen and Gary are gonna love this bread. (crickets chirping) - For then shall be great tribulation. Such as was not since the beginning of the world. Therefor rejoice, ye heavens in you to dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the Earth, and of the sea. For the Devil has come down unto you having great wrath, because he knowith that he hath but a short time. - Stephen, you've been studying that stuff for months. Will you come to bed? Your eyes are gonna fall out. Good night. (soft calm music) - [Radio Broadcaster] Within the European countries, the United Nations of Europe continue to be the world leader in sweeping social, and economic reform. According to the office of the Prime Minister the centralization of the world banking system should be completed-- - All done. - Thank you. - I love you Stephen. - [Radio Broadcaster] Should be brought to a stop and even reversed by the first of the year. The crackdown on anarchists and terrorist organization has won widespread approval. Public poles have indicated an overwhelming support for strong police action directed against subversive organizations as well as smaller ones. (hypnotic radio wave) Yesterday in Rome... Worldwide terrorist organization... (mysterious tense music) (frantic terrifying music) (screaming) - You look beat. - Anymore about Seattle come in? Thank you. - Yeah, they're now estimating about a 70% loss. - The world's gone nuts, you know that? There's a line of cars a mile long waiting to get into this town. I had to put Lonny on the main road block. We don't have enough supplies for our own people, let alone a bunch of refugees. - Oh, power company called. Most of the area's been restored here. - Oh good, at least we're in business again. - And there's a pile of messages on your desk. - Oh terrific. (groaning) - Have you eaten yet? - I don't think I've had a decent meal in days. - You wanna grab a bite? - What'd you have in mind? - How about my place? - Your place? - Yeah. - Yeah sure. - Yeah? Okay. Oh, well hey, you better take a look at this Jack. Just came off the teletype. - International executive order declaring a worldwide martial law. Fire arms are to be collected. Hoarding of food and supplies is a criminal act. Rewards of up to $1,000 will be issued for the capture of anarchists, Christians, and religious suppressives. Anyone caught looting or breaking curfew is to be shot. It's about time... - I don't like the sound of it. - If one obeys the law, there's nothing to worry about. It's the scum who break the law. They're the one that caused all this mess in the first place. - Where are you going? - I gotta get some more help. - Well what about dinner? - I'll be back. Stay close to the radio, and find out what Pete is up to, and feed the dogs. I'll call you. (dogs barking) - Feed yourselves. (whistling softly) (tense suspenseful music) - You can't believe how much stuff they have stashed here. - Let's see. Planning on having a big weekend huh? You know better than this. The hoarding of food and supplies carries a stiff penalty. This is gonna go hard. Put the cuffs on them and watch them. Alice, you there? Come on Alice, where are you? - Here, put these on them. (gunshot misfiring) (gunshot firing) - Lonny, don't! (gunshots firing) (dark malicious music) - [Alice] Go ahead Jack. Sorry, I was out back. Jack, are you there? - Alice, we've had a little trouble at the Dobb's place. Send a pickup out here. We found quite a cache of supplies. - Oh? - Stephen Miles, right? - Right, oh that's right, we met some months ago in town. - I haven't seen Don lately, is he here? - No. - Well accordance to martial law I'm here to collect fire arms and to check for any excess food. I trust you'll cooperate. - Well you trust wrong. You're not just walking in here and taking anything you wanna take. - I didn't come here to have any trouble. - We don't have any excess food! - Hey look you, shut up. Hey Lonny, bring some boxes in. Excuse me please. - Oh no, that's my bracelet. - You have very nice taste. - How can you do this? - June, please. - Hey Lonny come on, let's go! I think that's about it. - Sure you got everything? - Packing up for rough times? - Well well, just the man I've been looking for. - Is that right? Well I've been around. - Yeah, you've been around hoarding food and supplies, that's what you've been doing. - Looks like you're the one standing there with all the groceries. - You've been hoarding food and supplies for years now Pete. I wanna know where you got them stashed. I'm gonna find them, and when I do, I'm gonna fire you so far away that no one will know or care. - You just go out there and scratch around in the woods, but I'd be real careful. Lots of things can happen to a man back in the timber. Best keep your eyes peeled you at all times. Next time you come poking around leave your dog in the truck. - You shouldn't have done that. - What do you mean he shouldn't have done that. It's about time someone stood up to that guy. - Right, antagonize him, place every one of us in danger, which is exactly what both of you did. - Oh come on. - You think that man is going to let this drop? - Everyone thought old Pete was crazy, but I was right. He's the crazy one. - Well there's a better way to handle the man. - Yeah, well you tell me how! The man's out killing people. - What are you talking about? (dark foreboding music) - I swear to God, I'll kill him. - Pete, what's happened? Pete, Pete! - The Dobbs family. He killed them, right in front of my eyes. - What? - Who are the Dobbs? - They live on a farm about five miles from here. I can't believe it. - Pete... - [June] Where you going Pete? - I gotta warn some people. - Did you find anything on Pete yet? - No, no I haven't. - Well you find something. Now I don't care what it is, anything at all. - What in the world's the matter with you? - I'll be working with the dogs. (sighing) - Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him. I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. - [June] Stephen! - To him that overcometh will I-- - Stephen, Gary's gathering up his things. - What? - I guess he's leaving. - Why that's crazy! - Where are you gonna go? - I don't know. - Well don't you think it would be safer staying here with us? - I don't know. - I wish you'd stay Gary. I'm really scared for you. - What's the problem? - The problem? There's no problem. People are disappearing, fires falling out of the sky, families are being shot down in their front yards. Who's got problems? - Gary, they've slapped travel restrictions all over the place. - I don't need anyone's permission to travel. - Assuming you're not caught, where are you going to go? Here at least you've got food, shelter, us. - Look, I'm not gonna sit around here anymore and wait for someone to come in and... I'm tired of sitting, okay? - I don't think running's the answer. - What do you know about an answer? You sit around with your nose stuck in your Bible all day long! Well that's just fine, but you're not coming up with any answers! Yeah, tribulation and the rapture and the end of the world! Well that's great, but you give me an answer. Right now, give me an answer. No answers. You wonder why I don't believe in anything. The truck won't do you any good unless you get some parts for it. See you later. - Take good care of yourself Gary. - Stephen, I'm really getting scared. How do we know we won't be the next ones killed? (soft emotional music) - We haven't done anything. - I don't think that's going to matter. - I will come in to him. God... Jesus, Carl was right. You are a reality. Forgive me for ever doubting that. You say in the Bible, if you stand at the door and knock, and that any man hear your voice and open the door, you will come in to him. Jesus please, come in to me. I feel so helpless. June looks at me, like Gary said, I got no answers. Jesus, if it's not too late, forgive me for my wrongs... My sins. Help me. Help me to understand what to do. - No place to go. What are you doing here? - Looking for answers. - Find any? - I think so. I know two ladies that would be very glad to see you. - Yeah? - Come on. (soft emotional music) (crickets chirping) (dramatic tense music) - Who are they? - I don't know. He had a gun. It could be vigilantes. - Oh boy, let's get home. - Why don't you cut back by the road. I'm gonna follow them through the woods. - Okay. (wincing) - [Captors] What's your name? Why were you following us? - Stephen, Stephen Miles. - We found this on you. Are you a Christian? You're a Christian, aren't you? - Yes. - You just signed your death warrant. - You have one chance to renounce your faith, and to swear your allegiance to the Prime Minister. Swear. - I can't. I believe in Christ. - Welcome. We're Christians too. - Christians? - Yes, Christians. We believe that Jesus Christ is coming back soon, but we know very little. Bibles are becoming very scarce, and we're all new believers. - Me too. - Maybe they're the only kind of Christians there are now. Stephen? Would you want to join us? (laughing) - Yes, yes, yes! - Welcome, welcome Stephen Miles. - Welcome, welcome. - Sorry I had to hit you so hard. - Oh you're the... Yes, what a whack. - But we couldn't take any chances. When you fail to give the signal on the road, we had to stop you. - Signal? - We've got to be very careful. Perhaps you heard about the Dobbs'? - Yes I have. - The days of open worship are gone, and in order to meet we've become people of the night, and to protect ourselves we have a password, a signal. The word is life. - Life? - [Christian] Yes. - Life. - Yes, welcome. Welcome Stephen. - Life! (laughing) - Welcome. (laughing) - Praise the lord. There you go. - It's cold but it warms the heart. - Happy to receive Christ. By faith we are baptized in the name of the father, the son, and holy ghost. (dark foreboding music) - Prime Minister! (crowd commotion) - [Crowd] Prime Minister, tell us why-- (crowd commotion) - Mister Prime Minister, you've been in office for two years now. Is the most reverent Casa to be your new secretary of internal affairs? The most reverent Casa has been been my spiritual advisor for the past three and half years. (explosive gunshot) (screaming) - [Man] Somebody get an ambulance! - Behold says the prince of this world. Behold I send my messenger, (mysterious mystic music) and he shall prepare the way before my chosen one. I will curse him that curseth thee. Upon his throne and upon his kingdom shall my power be shown. Therefor will I divide, have a portion with the great, and he shall rule with the strong, because he hath poured out his blood and to death... (speaking foreign language) And he was numbered among men. His number shall be the number of men. For the prince of this world shall redeem his soul from the power of the grave. (speaking foreign language) By the power of the prince of this world, I say to you, (speaking foreign language) Come forth! (epic grandiose music) (crowd commotion) - [Announcer] Standing before this very crowd, his arms outstretched. People are cheering and praising the prince of this world. Medical experts are amazed, speechless at this miracle. There is no doubt he lives. The prince of the world lives. It is a miracle. People are chanting, who is like the prince? Who is like the prince? And indeed, who in all history is like the prince? - You hear something? - [Announcer] A new age has dawned. - Turn the radio off. - [Announcer] Praise he the prince! - Yes? - By order of the prince of the world, all people shall report for the universal census. There shall be no exceptions. In this area the census bureau will be set up at the county courthouse. And everyone living in this residence will be expected to report, and to be registered. At that time you will have the opportunity to pledge your allegiance to the prince, and receive the economic mark. And those that refuse to receive the mark will be considered outside the new world order, and an enemy of the state. Any questions? Oh and make sure that Pete's there too to register. - I can't guarantee that. - Well you tell him if he doesn't show I'll hold you fully responsible. - Look, Pete's just a friend. He doesn't live here. - Miles, don't ever take me for a fool. You'll let him know, huh? Is that clear? Good night. - Gary find Pete, tell him to call a meeting tonight. June, Cindy, let's get together all the supplies. (crowd commotion) - Wait a minute. Hold it folks, hold it. Stephen's got a point to make. - Thank you. And he causeth all both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads, and that no man might buy or sell, save that he had the mark for the name of the beast, or the number of his name. For an hour we have talked about economics, safety to the group... Wendell, I'm sure that you can simulate the mark so we can buy, and we can move with freedom. But the issue is, what the mark stands for. It's the mark of the beast. We're not talking about some economic system. We're talking about our worship. The pledging of our worship. The prince wants to be God and he wants us branded as his. - I don't feel this is a pledge of our worship. What matters is what we know in our hearts. You can take the mark and not believe in what it stands for. - If what the doctor says is true, then why take the chance with a counterfeit? Why not just get the real mark? - Because Revelation very clearly warns us about taking the mark of the beast. - Now that depends upon your interpretation. Now the Bible is full of symbols. How do we know for sure that God himself didn't raise up the prince to usher in the millennial age? (crowd commotion) - But you're assuming that. - You have to consider it. - Okay folks. I think we've all expressed how we feel and, it's getting late so, I think it's time to make a decision. Those of you who refuse to take the mark under any circumstances, will you come and stand with me? - Don't be foolish. They're condemning themselves to death. Don't make a mistake Pete. - I've been making one stupid mistake after another. I'm tired of it. - Hey wait a minute! (crowd uproar) - Hold it, you're not leaving. - Gary, we can't hold them. - We can't just let them walk out of here. They know where the supplies are, they know everything about us. - If we're going to follow Jesus, we have to try to live like him. Folks, it's too dangerous to meet anymore. We've gotta split up. I suggest you take what supplies you can carry. God will go with you. Each of you. ♪ Jesus loves me ♪ This I know ♪ For the Bible tells me so ♪ Little ones to him they come ♪ Lay there weak but he is strong (powerful emotional music) - Any ideas? - Yup. I got it all figured out. The place is guaranteed pug proof. - Alice, you there? - [Alice] Right here. - There's no one around the Goodwin place. Doesn't look like they've been here for several weeks now. Did Lonny come up with anything? - [Alice] No, he didn't. - Well that doesn't surprise me. Tell Lonny to work with the dogs this afternoon, and listen, I won't be in for a day or two. I'm gonna be checking around on a hunch I got. See you honey. (mysterious tense music) (explosive gunshot) - Hey, everybody okay up there? - [Both] Pete! - [All] Are you okay? - Yeah. See I told you this place was guaranteed pug proof. (laughing) - You were right. (laughing) - You know, he came within just a few feet of me? I could've killed him like that. - A couple months ago you would've. - That's right, you would have. - Yeah, I guess I would've. - Well you're a new man Pete. - Yeah, I guess I am! (laughing) - Pete, a new man. - Looks like the same old guy to me. - He is too a new man. (laughing) - Come on up. - Dinner! - What do you think, nothing? - Nope. - June it's Thanksgiving, pork and beans. - I used to hate pork and beans, but I thank God for them now. (dogs barking) - June... - Dogs! (urgent frantic music) - Let's go! Not much further. Are you okay? (screaming) - Cindy, we're gonna have to split up. - Okay. - You take the upper trail. I'm gonna go around the edge of the swamp. Okay, go on. No, go on! (laughing) - Let the dog go. - [Lonny] After them! (screaming) (dog attacking) (laughing) - Ah, there's nothing like an early morning hunt, eh Lonny? Especially when the bounty's so high. (laughing) Now why don't you save yourself some unpleasantness, and tell us where they are, eh? (laughing) We're gonna find them anyway, huh, huh, huh? You just might be saving their lives, eh? - Deliver me, oh God please! (miraculous music) - Get her up. - Come on, get... I think she's dead. - What do you? Get up! Take the dogs back to the truck. I'll be along in a bit. (screaming) - I'm sorry Cindy, what's happened? I heard dogs. - Pug. - Pug? - And dogs. - Where's June? - We split at the swamp. - The swamp! - Stephen no! - Head back to the distillery. (gun cocking) - Hello Christian. (explosive gunshot) (explosive gunshot) - Pete... June's dead. - Yeah, I know. - She's with Jesus. Easy now. Just take it easy. - Okay! (struggling) - Okay give me the meat. - Make sure you don't lick your fingers. - Thanks for the warning. I'll try to remember. You stay here and keep lookout. (breaks screeching) - Pete! Pete! (explosive gunshot) (dogs barking) (laughing) - Here, watch it. I'm going after the other one. Here! (crying) - God... No. (sad sorrowful music) - God, he shot you pretty bad Pete. - Get out of here. Get back to the distillery. - Not without you. - Try to get to the high country. Follow Christ. Don't give in to them. - We won't, come on. Pete... (dogs crying) (gun cocking) - No Alice. - I told you Pete is dead, now pack up your stuff! Cindy, we have got to get out of here. Pete said get up to the high country. - Stephen isn't getting any better. We've got to get him to a doctor. - It is suicide going back into that town. There is one doctor in the town and there's no way he is gonna treat him without the mark. - We can't let him die! - He's gonna die anyway. We're all gonna die. - Gary! Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer. Ye shall have tribulation. Be though faithful until death and I will give thee a crown of life. We've gotta be faithful to the end. (doorbell ringing) - Stephen Miles. At least he doesn't have the plague. Let's get him. He's hurt badly. Let's get him inside. (soft emotional music) - We don't need the money. They'll kill him. - We can't keep him here. They'll kill us. - Stephen, Stephen wake up! Something's gone to tell me that you have got to get out of here now. Stephen wake up. You've got to get out of here now. Stephen wake up! (mumbling) Don't say anything! Don't talk. There's medicine in your pocket, take it. You'll be alright. You've got to get out of here. - Take it easy. Come on. (mysterious music) - Oh Lord... - It's the plague. - Let's head for the trees. - The local pockets of resistance are really quite remote and fragmented. They pose no threat at all to your reign. Time will take care of them. As for the Chinese, they could pose a potential problem, but one that with care and if need be force, can be handled. - Rare, very rare. - We've been able to virtually starve them out. They have to make some accommodations. Accommodations? I've had my fill of Chinese and so called local resistance. I'll have no more of the pig Jews. I am their God. They will worship me or they'll burn. If they want war, I'll give them war. (dark foreboding music) (explosive blasts) (birds chirping) (dramatic tense music) - It was cold last night. - Fall's setting in. - Yeah, it is. I've been thinking about that. You know, we can't afford to get caught up here in an early snow. - I'd hate to leave the high country. - We don't have much choice. - No we don't, but he that endureth to the end, shall be saved. - [Cindy] Amen. - It's getting close you know? - Oh I know. - [Gary] You looking forward to seeing June? - And Pete! (laughing) It's gonna be a great reunion. - I bet he has everything organized up there. He'll be there to greet us. - And there shall be no death, nor sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be anymore pain. - And he shall reign forever and ever, king of kings, lord of lords. Praise God. ♪ We shall endure ♪ We shall endure ♪ He is lord forevermore ♪ We shall endure ♪ Jesus is king ♪ Jesus is king ♪ He is lord forevermore ♪ Jesus is king ♪ He's coming soon ♪ He's coming soon ♪ He is lord forevermore ♪ He's coming soon (dark foreboding music) - Listen. - I don't hear anything. - That's what I mean. Birds, they've stopped singing. (loud shining tone) (explosive gunshot) - Darn you! Darn you! (explosive gunshot) Darn you! Darn you! (screaming) (thunderous rumbling) (dark foreboding music) (magical whistling) (holy music)
