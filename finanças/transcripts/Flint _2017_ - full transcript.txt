You can taste a little of the chlorine, but it's safe to drink. I think it's more a matter of perception. My family and I, we drink and use it every day. - And the Governor is aware of Flint's water problems? - We've been in touch, of course, and his office has assured me that Flint's water system is producing water that meets all state and federal standards.

(Retches) - Oh Nayyirah... - Are you okay? Everything all right? - Yeah, just give me a sec. - Well, this is our lives now. We get up, have our breakfast, brush our teeth, listen to music, surf the internet and then dash to the bathroom to vomit our guts out. - This has got to stop... What-what is all of that? - Oh uh... Prednisone and Tylenol. Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide for the kidney damage. Metroprolol and Neurotnin for the seizures... And guess what? Side effects include muscle cramps, nausea, fatigue and dizziness. Claire: You all right? - Yeah. Where was I? Um... Okay. Okay. Basically, this is what I was saying. This country is sitting on like 7.3 million ancient lead service lines. If you run just any old water through them, without like protection, the water will take pretty much anything in those pipes right along for the ride... straight into our taps. - Okay. What's this "protection"? - Um, water treatment. It's called Corrosion Control. - And we have that? - Yeah... I mean, I don't know exactly what we're using or how much, but I do know that every city has to have it. - Sure. - So corrosion controls coats the inside of old pipes. So that when we have to pump disinfectants, like chlorine and ammonia, into the system to kill bacteria... Corrosion control stops those disinfectants from eating through the metal. It stops them from releasing lead and iron and copper, and all that, you know, stuff, into our water. - Then why do my kids have lead poisoning? - Well, remember when last year All: Yeah? - Boiling only concentrates the lead in the water more! Right? - Yeah. (Disbelieving exhales) - Okay. Okay. So, we either drink deadly bacteria or we drink brain-damaging lead? - It's ridiculous that anyone would think that that river would be okay to drink. The car industry and the plants have been dumping chemicals into that water for a century! And then there's the sewage, the road salt... - Yeah. They've even found a couple of bodies. - Yeah. Yeah, but that doesn't actually matter. That's what water treatment facilities are supposed to handle. They, they treat water at the beginning, at the source. - With this corrosion control? - Yes. - So then that should've been the end of it? - Yeah. - Then what's going on? - We gotta find out. (Big exhale) - I've been getting a lotta complaints about the water from my constituents. The smell, the taste, the color. It's come up in the council time and time again that using the River Water in the interim hasn't been of the kind of quality that we've had before. All: (In agreement) Yeah. Absolutely right. For sure. - Therefore the council has voted on the matter. - (Coughs) - It is the council's decision seven to one to return to Detroit Lake Huron as the city's main water source immediately. (Applause) - Yes! Thank you! (Applause) - Mr. Ambrose, will you review the council's decision? - I will. It's an incomprehensible decision. Going back on Detroit water will cost this already-broke city tens of millions of dollars that we don't have. - What do we do in the meantime? - What? - Look, I'm realistic. The city is on the verge of financial disaster ever since many of the car plants closed down. We need to make some aggressive and radical decisions about how to save money. - Right. Like making us drink poison? Is that what you're talking about? - You understand? To save Flint we have to save money. Detroit water is simply too expensive. As the appointed emergency manager I herewith overrule the council's decision. - (Upset murmuring) Oh my God! Hey! Hey! Hey listen! Of GM pull out of this, why can't we? - That's apples and oranges. - No! - Just because there have been a few isolated cases doesn't mean there's a city-wide problem. Melissa: Isolated cases?! Listen, my son has been diagnosed with lead poisoning! Our hair's falling out, we are sick and nauseous everyday! - Have you even looked at these? Or are you just trying to save money... - Wait a minute. It wasn't my decision to disconnect from Detroit water. That was a long-standing plan that's was meticulously budgeted out, approved by this council. - No. We never agreed to use Flint River Water! We agreed to the KWA Pipeline! - That's right. - (Applause) - And while we're building the KWA Pipeline, we switched to Flint River Water as a temporary cost-saving measure. Now look, we can't have a bunch of housewives taking on our experts! - Excuse me?! - And when someone wants to make a point, they dunk some tea bags... - What?! Come on! - Hey! Hey! Excuse me, sir! Did you just call me a liar and stupid? We're your experts? Nobody's dunking tea in the water, that's ridiculous! - Listen, we can't trek back and forth to the store for bottled water! - Everyday! Ambrose: Look! Look! You're broke! Your city is broke! There's nothing else I can do. - What do you expect it's a reelection year for the Mayor. - Can he do that? - He's not gonna side with us 'cuz we don't have a say. He just wants to play hooky with the Governor. - Look, they can all try to shut us up. But I know what I know. Look, I've been worried from the start. Since we switched to the river water. Just keep fightin', lady. Ladies... - We will. Thank you. (Doorbell rings) - Mrs. Walters? - Yeah. - Miguel Del Toral from the EPA. We spoke on the phone. - Yeah. Hey. You're our lead and copper expert! - In the flesh. Never seen anyone get so excited about seeing me before. - Well, you know what? I'm, I'm just glad that you actually made it out here. - Well, Chicago is right around the corner. This is my job. (Both chuckle) (Water runs) - So when the city came out to test, what was their procedure? - They told me not to keep the water stagnant for more than eight hours. - Huh. They capped it? - Yeah, they said otherwise it disqualified the result. And then they flushed it for 25 minutes before they took a sample. - Huh. - Oh, I, I have one of those test bottles. That's what they used. - Huh. - Okay. You keep saying that a lot. - It's a very small bottle opening. - Yeah? - If it's that small, you have to run the water really slowly. Now slow flow doesn't really capture a realistic situation. - What, what do you mean? - I like to call that a "loop hole". - For what? - For passing inspections. - Hey, can I ask you something? - Sure. - What sort of corrosion control is the city using? - Do you know what that is? - Yeah, it's coating on the inside of the pipes so that they don't leach copper and lead into the water. - You should be doing my job. - Well... - But yes, the MDEQ told me they had a program in place. - Is it effective? - I'm not sure. That's why I'm here doing a test. - You don't come to most people's homes, do you? - No. - So, why did you come to mine? - Those were some scary numbers. I kinda had to see it for myself. - Yeah.

(All laugh) - God, I really wanna punch something. - Don't look at me, Melissa. - Oh my God, I almost forgot. Thank God, I brought this. - Mmm. - Yeah. Great. (Big exhale) - Oh, no, no, no. I don't, I don't drink. - Why not? - I'm Muslim. - Muslim? - Yeah. - Cool. - Well, I'm not Muslin so... - This is perfect. - Fill me up. (They chuckle) - Thanks. (Wine pours) - You gotta like this potato salad. (All in agreement) Uh... LeeAnne: So um... we're moving. - What? Where? - Virginia. Dennis re-enlisted for active duty. And it's, it's just better for everybody. I... - Wow. Hmm... Well, what about, what about the house? - We're gonna keep it. I mean, it's not you can really sell a house in Flint right now. (Sighs) It's about that kids, you know. I want them to be able to wash their hands with something other than hand sanitizer so... - You know what, I don't blame you. If we could move we all would. - But we're stuck. - Yeah, I am. Great. Get your ass on out of here. Just ride off into the sunset. - That's not fair! I couldn't have done any of this without you. I know that. - Yeah, cool beans, whatever. - Melissa. - She just means she'll miss you. - Yeah. Yeah. I will miss her, too. Gonna miss you all. Thank you. (Footsteps thud) - Well, what did they say? - Dr. Eden Wells compared my analysis against that of the state epidemiologists. You know why they claimed the state results were inconsistent with mine? - Hit me. - The state's number included kids from outside Flint! - Okay. So what does that mean? - It's confirmed! The state's own data analysts now confirms all our numbers. - That's amazing. And terrible. - Genesee County is declaring a public health emergency. - So we did it. There's no way they can talk themselves out of this now. - Oh, I'm so relieved! - Thank you so much. Is it weird to be celebrating a public health emergency declaration? - Yeah. It's a little weird... - Okay. Well, it's gonna have to be weird. It's gonna have to be weird. (Low hum of chatter) Nayyirah: We'd already have been let down by the State, but now with the press behind us we knew we were being heard. The question on all our minds was whether the city could really ignore our outcries and a mountain of evidence... any longer. - Effective today, the City of Flint is reversing the decision of four emergency managers. We fought back to get us on Detroit water. The State's results confirmed that Flint's drinking water was contributing to high lead levels, it made me furious. This community was rightly outraged. A group of citizen-heroes made sure this testing was done well and done right. The city could not have funded a better study of our water. The City of Flint is reconnecting to Detroit's Department of Water and Sewerage as the sole water source at 5 p.m. today. - Woo! Yes! (Applause and cheering) Nayyirah: It was our first victory. And maybe in the scheme of things it was a small victory but... a victory all the same. (Applause and cheering) ♪ (Low hum of chatter) (Door shuts) - Miguel! You're late, but you're here! Oh hey! - What did I miss? - Flint's going back on Detroit water! - We did it! We freakin' did it! - It's about time! I thought they'd come up with another good excuse not to! - Yeah. - Thank you! (Laughing) - I-I've heard so much about you. - Hey. - You are all inspiring woman. A little stubborn... (Laughing) You know, you're like the women with the vote... - Suffragettes? - Tip of my tongue! - Well, listen at least we didn't have to starve ourselves, huh? - They might of got the vote, but I don't think this is over yet. - It's not gonna change overnight. - That's right. - A lot of damage has been done. - Yeah, who knows how long that's gonna take to fix that so... - It's a first step. But we're not gonna quit now. - That's right. - That's right (Celebratory laughter) ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (Chanting) No justice, no peace! No justice, no peace! No justice, no peace! Flint lives matter!
