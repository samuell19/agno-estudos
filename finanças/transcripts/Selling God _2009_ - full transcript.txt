Somewhere between the invention of the wheel and the discovery of electricity, Jesus Christ was born. He proclaimed to the world... I am the way. The truth of the life. No man comes to the father but by me. He told people he was the son of God. He beckoned them to follow him. Thus was sparked one of the most pervasive religions in the world, Christianity. Peter the Apostle spread the word of Jesus to the world through the Christian church. Unfortunately, inviting and differing interpretations of what Jesus Christ actually said, felt or believed, led to the creation of many different denominations. In In 1054, the Great Schism occurred as Pope Leo IX, the patriarch of Constantinople excommunicated each other at the same time. Because among other things, they disagreed about what day to celebrate Easter. This created two separate churches. The Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church. Each of whom thought they were the one holy Catholic and Apostolic church while the other had left the true church. In 1517, Martin Luther posted his 95 thesis questioning the power of the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church and thus was sparked the Protestant Reclamation. All across Europe and throughout the world, Protestant groups broke off into their own religions as different groups adopted differing interpretations of the Bible. When Pope Clement VII refused to let King Henry VIII get a divorce, Henry broke away from the Catholic church and created the Anglican Church. When it spread to America it became the Episcopal Church. The other Baptists broke off and eventually became the Amish, Mennonites, Quakers, and Baptists. John Knox created Presbyterianism. John Wesley had Methodism. And John Calvin had Reformed Christianity. There sure were a lot of Johns and a lot of churches. Despite the differences between the over 1500 Christian denominations, most of the modern incarnations of Christianity agree on seven basic tenets. People did not evolve from monkeys. Gay sex isn't natural. Life begins by conception. Guns are good. Hollywood is evil. And God is the determining factor in all wars, major sporting events and award shows. My whole family. Thank you, Jesus. But the most Important tenet across all of Christianity is to spread the good news. Evangelism is an integral part of most Christian denominations. Much like Amway, it's never enough just to believe, they must also get all their friends, family, and even strangers to believe as well. Even the kid from Growing Pains is in on it. The reason we as a church exist here on earth is to be a witness for Jesus Christ. And he said, go into all the world and preach the gospel with every creature. So if you're a Christian, learn to focus your attention on the most important reason the church exists on the earth. To seek and save the lost the way Jesus did. And commit yourself to the Lord and to the lost. And they can't just believe in Jesus as Lord and Savior, they have to believe in him exactly as does the person evangelizing. We often see evangelism as, let's make someone believe just like me, dogma and doctrine. I think modern evangelism should be making friends with God. Or teaching one how to be more tolerant, more loving. I think modern evangelism is not about dogma or doctrine, but about introducing... Qualities of life through a belief system. And if the belief system promoted does not improve ones approach to life, it's done nothing except change their dogma or doctrine. It's interesting to note how many people use the psychological concept of projection when relaying their understanding of what God said, felt, or believed. Oddly enough God generally shares the same view as the interpreter. For example, you'll never hear someone say, God is not on our side in this war but we're gonna give it our all anyway. Or you'll never hear someone say, God hates gay people, but I think they're snazzy dressers. When we ask will the real Jesus stand up, we all have the tendency to say, God is on our side. And we know what the real Jesus would be doing. Israeli extremists tell us that God gave them the land at the West bank as part of the promised land. Palestinian extremists tell us that God told them they could have the West bank. It's enough to make one question why God can't make up his or her mind. To this day, Jesus plays a very important role in the values and even he decision-making of modern Christians. Rhetorical questions are often used to determine his position on contemporary issues. Christians are apt to ask themselves and even others, what would Jesus do? What would Jesus drive? So if we love our neighbor and we cherish God's creation, maybe we should ask, what would Jesus drive? What would Jesus eat? Who would Jesus vote for? Or even, who would Jesus kill? You know I don't know about this doctrine of assassination but if he thinks we're trying to assassinate him, I think we really outta go ahead and do it. It's a whole lot cheaper than starting a war. And I don't think any oil shipments will stop. Once again, it's interesting to note how Jesus would always have done what the person answering the question would do. For example, it's unlikely to hear someone say, Jesus would drive a compact Japanese car but I prefer the styling of German sedans. Or, Jesus would probably have the Caesar salad with thousand island on the side, but I really do prefer a double cheeseburger with all the extras. After extensive Biblical research however, it turns out he would've driven a donkey and eaten a lot of fish. What everyone thinks Jesus said, felt, or believed, it's important to serve as a witness to the rest of the world. His witnesses take on a variety of forms. In a ritual act of allegiance, miniature replicas of torture devices may be worn around ones neck. In order to witness to other drivers sitting in traffic, the back of ones vehicle may be used to share sound bytes and symbols of faith. And for those feeling especially bold, one could even send orders to God him or herself. Regardless of how individuals within a church share their faith, it's just important that they actually do it. How effectively people are able to share their faith is the deciding factor in the battlefield of religion. The Jesus Christ action figure. Turn water into wine. Now with realistic walking action. Relive the exciting Sermon on the Mount. Natural selection dictates that churches with effective strategies for building and maintaining their followers will thrive. While those lacking these game plans will eventually disappear. The only way for a church to survive is to keep a constant and growing congregation. Some have done better than others. A prime example of a church that's doomed to failure from the beginning was that of the Shakers. Under the leadership of Mother Ann, the Shakers turned away from sexual intercourse. And their attempt to live pure lives elevated from the basis of human desires, the entire group became celibate. As to be expected, this rather important church doctrine prevented the Shaker movement from growing. There are currently only a handful of living Shakers, all of them elderly women. Although the Roman Catholic church does require a vow of celibacy from the clergy, they allow church members to engage in carnal pleasures. The particular brilliance of the Catholic doctrine is the prohibition of any form of birth control. This policy, in essence ensures that the church will keep growing and growing and growing. Unlike the Shakers, the Catholic church has grown to over one billion members. The Mormon churches former practice of polygamy did wonders to help it grow. By marrying many women of childbearing age, the founders were able to grow their church very quickly. Joseph Smith, the prophet of the Mormon church had at least 33 wives. And Brigham Young, the second prophet of the church had 52 wives and 56 children. Thanks in no small part to this brilliant doctrine for survival, the Mormon church grew by leaps and bounds. It's practice has long since been disavowed by the church but they replaced it with an equally effective policy for helping the church grow. All men between the ages of 19 and 26 are encouraged to spend two years doing missionary service. The Jehovah's Witnesses used the same method of door-to-door evangelism. All members of the church are encouraged to go from door-to-door, spreading the message of their faith by giving out copies of The Watchtower. And doing Bible study with anyone interested. This has helped the church grow, but has unfortunately been counteracted by the churches prohibition of vaccinations, blood transfusions, and organ transplants. Needless to say, this policy has stood in the way of helping the church really grow. As new members are brought in, others die. Following the lead of George Hensley, a group of charismatic Christians sprang up in the Appalachian Mountains. They took the Biblical verse found in Mark 16:18 literally. They shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them. They shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. Mark 16:18. In their church services, members are encouraged to handle copperheads and rattlesnakes, drink water that is laced with strychnine and arsenic and place their hands in fire. To date, 75 people, including the founder have died as a result of their faith. Needless to say, the charismatic movement is slowly disappearing. Perhaps the most effective group in building and maintaining their followers is the evangelical movement that is spreading across the country. Like many religious movements, they feel that their most important job is to sell God to the masses, spread the good news of the gospels, and bring more converts into the fold. This movement has made use of every form of marketing available; television, music, books, tee shirts, bumper stickers and every other conceivable of branding. There's even a Christian themed amusement park where you can walk through the streets of Jerusalem, shop at the Bible street market, and have your picture taken with Jesus. The selling of God is so pervasive that any threat to it is seen as a threat to Christianity itself. In what has been dubbed the war on Christmas, some Christian groups have declared boycotts against American retailers that don't use Christmas in their advertisements. The American Family Association boycotted Target stores for using the term, happy holidays instead of Merry Christmas in their fliers and commercials. Wal-mart quickly put Christmas back in their holiday advertisements when the Catholic league threatened to boycott. And the Committee to Save Merry Christmas targeted Sears and Macy's. It was clear that these retailers had better put Christ back in Christmas and Christmas back in consumerism. Heaven forbid things be bought and sold without invoking the name of Christ. Bill O'Reilly, of The O'Reilly Factor put it best. Every company in America should be on its knees thanking Jesus for being born. Without Christmas, most American businesses would be far less profitable. More than enough reason for business to be screaming, Merry Christmas. Yes, the members of reason for the season. Sales, because when Jesus saves, it's not just 20%. And besides, it's easier to put Christ back in Christmas than back in our foreign policy. Selling God is the essence of evangelism. It isn't good enough to believe, everyone else has to believe as well. To see how this evangelism actually works we'll need to start at the beginning with marketing theory 101. All modern marketing works the same way whether you're selling clothing or cars, soda or salvation. Selling God is no different. The first thing that must be done is to create a need. The second is to offer a product or service to fill that need. The third is to offer rewards for buying the product or service and threaten consequences for not buying. And the final step is to create urgency. There has to be a deadline to act or people will just keep putting it off. For children, one of the most well known figures that uses these concepts to adjust behavior is Santa Claus. Yes, jolly ol' Saint Nick. The omnipotent craftsman that lives up north has been used to control the habits of children for centuries. He keeps a list of who's naughty and who's nice, so you better be good and do what you're told or you'll get coal for Christmas instead of toys. Evangelism in any religious movement uses the same basic principles to spread their message throughout the world and adjust the behaviors of followers. First they must start by creating the need. If you're basically a good person, you don't need what they're offering. But if by just being born, you're a sinner, then you're definitely in need of salvation. You need to admit you're a sinner and call on the Lord and he'll save you tonight. Next, they offer Jesus Christ who, having already died for your sins is the perfect product to counteract your previously established sinful nature. And attending their church or watching their program is the perfect service to help you fill this new found void in your life. Guilt is an incredible motivator. Listen, if you want your sins forgiven, if you wanna know that when you die you'll go to Heaven. If you want that hole in your heart filled. If you wanna find the meaning and purpose of life you've been searching for. If you want your guilt taken away. If you wanna be ready for the return of Jesus Christ, I'm gonna ask ya wherever you're sitting to get up out of your seats, step into the nearest aisle and make your way down to the field. Then they offer rewards and consequences. A carrot and a stick. Heaven and Hell. No friend, you don't have to go to Hell. God wants you to join Him for all eternity in Heaven. You go to Heaven if you're good which means you obey us and if you don't obey us you'll go to Hell. And you're talking here about your eternal soul, either for reward or punishment, which appeals to normal greed for people. And at the same time it's a real winner as far as getting... Getting their business. Each religions conception of Heaven and Hell is different but historically Heaven represents everything good and Hell, everything that's to be feared. Don't put it off until tomorrow or next week or next month. Prepare to meet your God. You don't know when Christ is gonna come back. You don't know when life is gonna end. And finally, they create urgency by reminding people that life is fleeting or even that Armageddon is coming. The world is coming to an end and the rapture or the second coming of Christ is on the horizon. And as we see these signs increasing and getting closer and together Jesus says, you know my coming is near. Every time we turn around it's something new. It's a Tsunami, it's an earthquake, it's a new war, it's a new conflict, a new act of terrorism. Just when it calms down it heats up again. Folks, these are signs of the times and Jesus said, when you see these things begin to happen, look up for your redemption is drawing near. Jesus is coming back again. And the Bible predicted it. While being placed on hold and listening to Muzak, and then talking to a secretary of one of the evangelical operations, she told me that in South Korea, this particular evangelical operation had it's evangelistic technique so finally honed that she could save a soul for 47 cents. Well that was computed in the following way. It costs so many hundreds of thousands to rent a stadium and fill it with so many people. And then you get so many people to sign the card that they accept Jesus as their personal savior. And then you divide the number of people that signed the cards into the cost of renting the stadium, you now saved a soul for 47 cents. Well, I'd like to know what you save for 47 cents. There's a cottage industry of saving the lost and delivering their souls. In a world full of people walking blindly through life, who do you know who isn't saved? What are you going to do about it? 2% of Christians in America share their faith regularly with others. The reason we as a church exist here on earth is to be a witness for Jesus Christ. Remember 140,000 people die every 24 hours. We must keep the light of the gospel shining so that the unconverted will flee to the savior. The way of the master. 13 unique, fascinating and challenging half hour episodes teaching Christians how to share their faith simply, effectively, Biblically, the way Jesus did. In a very large measure, the Christian church still is a franchise and a business. They're in the business of feeding upon peoples weaknesses and guilt and I think that's shameful because certainly Jesus never envisioned that when he laid out the groundwork for spirituality. Over the years there have been repeated periods of religious revivalism, you know, great revivals I mean, fundamentalist beliefs swept, it wasn't called fundamentalists in those days. It's a more modern term but what we call fundamentalist beliefs spread over the country in a kind of hysteria. Here's the gospel in a nutshell, we've all sinned. We've all fallen short of God's standards. We've all deliberately crossed the line. There's nothing we can do to meet the righteous requirements of God. But God loved us so much, 2,000 years ago he sent his son, Jesus Christ, fully God and fully man to die on the cross for our sin. And he bodily rose again from the dead. Now we'll turn from our sin and put our faith in Christ, we can be forgiven and know that we will go to Heaven when we die and by the meaning and purpose we've been looking for. That's the gospel truth. Now you've heard it and you're responsible. So respond. So once again, you are a sinner. Jesus Christ is the salvation. If you believe, you'll go to Heaven. And if you don't, you go to Hell. Armageddon is upon us. Oh, and don't forget, Jesus loves you. Sin has been defined a number of ways, but the most expansive list is the seven deadly sins. Defined by Pope Gregory I, late in the 6th century, the seven deadly sins are: lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, envy, and pride. Since these are all common human attributes, this list of deadly sins makes humanity sinful by definition. If sin is defined this broadly, we are all sinners. If this isn't enough to make everyone a sinner, the concept of original sin states that we're all born sinners. Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned, Romans 5:12. Because we're all descendants of Adam and Eve, we're all implicated in their original sin of eating an apple. All that for an apple. Not a croissant. Not prime rib, but one stinking apple. We all, we're born into this world with a sinful nature. So everybody's sinful. This expansive concept of humans as inherently sinful is a wonderful way to create guilt and reliance on religion. We're not all born good, we're all born bad. We've inherited by genetics spiritual nature from our original parents, Adam and Eve, a fallen nature. And we choose to do wrong rather than right because we're sinners by nature and need a second birth, a spiritual birth, ever to meet God. Well, throughout history, guilt has been used within religion as a form of control. And if you think about many religions that are out there, especially within the Christian religions, one of the ways that they've been able to keep the churches alive is via using guilt. And guilt is something that, unfortunately, doesn't have to be a part of society, but it has been used for thousands of years. Paul struggled with the implications of this sinful nature in the Book of Romans. I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do. And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good. As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me. I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. For what I do is not the good I want to do; no, the evil I do not want to do, this I keep on doing. Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is not longer I who do it, but it is the sin living in me that does it. Romans 7:15 to 20. Paul was in such despair that he resorted to tongue twisters. He felt like a hopeless sinner because he felt he was born sinful. Many people even view the human body as being sinful. They turn to Adam and Eve's first sin and the shame they felt on realizing they were naked. Through every period of time in Judeo-Christian history, the body has been seen as taboo. Men, and especially women, were forced to cover their bodies and hide their sinful nature. One would think that we would pass this shame and discuss associated with the body, but the biggest story in 2004 in America was not the war in Iraq. It was not the Presidential election. It was Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction, or as some have dubbed it, Nipplegate. Parents were outraged. Congressional hearings were held. And $550,000 worth of fines were levied. All because one human breast was seen in public. Laughter could be heard from the topless beaches of Europe to the tribal villages of Africa. They laughed in unison. America was brought to a halt by a breast. Breastfeeding in public is even looked down on by many as being shameful. This has naturally led some to ask, what did Jesus drink? We were on a cruise one time, which was a European style cruise to where the women could go topless. Well, my wife at the time was topless and another passenger came up to her and says, well my gosh, how in the world could you at all be spiritual or religious if you're going topless because it says right in the Bible that thou shall dress in modesty. Well we paused for a moment and this gal that was talking to my wife at the time had a two piece bathing suit on and we thought, well if you wanna take the literal words of the Bible, when the Bible was written, that two piece bathing suit that you're wearing right now would get you stoned to death. So, what is dressing in modesty? So this is where you have to adjust your morals depending on where you live, in the world. Where you live in society. Whether you live in the mountains and you're a hermit or whether you're living downtown New York in a high rise. Or whether you have a Home Owner's association, you're gonna have to redefine your morals depend upon the lifestyle that you want to live in order to fit in. But this isn't just about Janet Jackson's breast or topless sunbathing. It's about viewing the entire body and bodily functions as sinful. To create reliance on religion, everything in the Judeo-Christian Bible has been defined as sinful. From masturbation to menstruation. Based on the ancient belief in animism that blood is the very source life, all loss of bodily fluids is considered sinful, even if it's natural. When a woman has her regular flow of blood, the impurity of her monthly period will last seven days, and anyone who touches her will be unclean until evening. Leviticus 15:19. During her period, an Israelite woman was not allowed to enter the temple because the sinful nature of her blood would defile the sanctuary. This is one of the reasons that it would have been impossible for a woman to serve as priests. For men, it was considered sinful to ever emit semen except for the purposes of procreation. When a man has an emission of semen, he must bathe his whole body with water, and he will be unclean till evening. Leviticus 15:16. Therefore every woman of childbearing age and every man of, any age, is a sinner and in need of salvation. These aren't just old superstitions that have long since been abandoned. In December of 1994, US Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was forced to resign for stating that masturbation is a part of human sexuality. She was obviously wrong and we're all obviously sinners. In addition, even in this day and age of equality, women are still not allowed to hold positions of religious authority in the Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church, and most Protestant denominations. It's not clear whether it's the presence of a menstrual cycle or the lack of a penis that makes women unqualified to serve as clerics. Needless to say however, they are sinful by nature and need salvation through the churches that reject them. Since the wages of sin is death and the mortality rate for humans is still at 100%, this would tend to support the conclusion that all humans are sinful. The question that remains is what happens after death? When I think about Heaven and Hell, Heaven can be a literal place as well as, in my worldview, a time past the current age that we live in. Meaning that there's no degradation, no death. There's good things. Hell on the other hand, often is viewed as fires and torture and things like that, but since I believe in a God that is not arbitrary, vengeful, or severe, I don't believe in hellfire that lasts forever, that tortures people. I think we have to explore more. And I'm still exploring what those things mean. The concept of Heaven pervades the Old Testament. But it was Jesus Christ who introduced the fiery brimstone of Hell to Christianity. Based on Gehenna, the trash dump of the day where trash and bodies were incinerated, Jesus painted a vivid picture of Hells fiery inferno. And Jesus said more about Hell, by the way, than he did about Heaven. He warned us over and over not to go there. If you go to Hell it's in spite of everything God could do to keep you out. His son, Jesus, died for you. In a piece of marketing genius, future generations developed eternal damnation in the fires of Hell as the consequences of not accepting him as Lord and Savior. Hell is like the worst torment you can ever imagine. You don't want to be there. Hmm, it's fiery and you know, what you would imagine Hell to be. It's just torment and misery and sorrow and everyone's crying and it's pretty bad. There are many visions of Hell. But they all boil down to a place full of everything you despise. For some, Hell will be a place where all they eat are brussel sprouts. And they will be forced to listen to Barry Manilow for all eternity. For others, liver will be on the menu and the only form of entertainment would be listening to their Uncle Bernie telling obnoxious lawyer jokes forever. Then of course, there is the devil with his pitchfork and horns. His pitchfork and horns. The dragon and serpents and of course, plenty of fire. This vision of eternal damnation in the torturing inferno of Hell's fire has been very useful with converting people to one faith or another. During the middle ages, the Catholic Church told the masses about the horrors of Hell in order to sell salvation. They sold indulgences or forgiveness in advance for sins yet to be committed. Families could even pay for their deceased members to get out of purgatory, sort of a Hell lite. All in all, church had the world's best business model. Now my good people. This is no ordinary indulgence. Full forgiveness for all sins. Absolution from all punishments. No confession necessary. Valid even for your loved ones in purgatory. For who would see his mother in flames when, with a piece of silver he can set her free. For as soon as the money clicks in the chest, a soul flies up to Heavenly rest. The churches motto has survived intact throughout the ages. Fear of Hell and damnation has served well as this models cornerstone, it's foundation, the ultimate selling point. Join us or got to Hell. In fact, in the information age, people are able to go online and find out if they're going to Heaven or Hell. Heaven and Hell, I believe, was designed as a form of keeping people in line, in a sense. Being able to help people realize that if they don't follow the rules, that they're going to go someplace which they called Hell which could be the same as, in our society, going to prison. And none of us want to go to prison so, therefore, we follow the rules. To this day, sadistic visions of Hell are one of the best marketing ploys to reach unaffected people. And let me ask you this question right now, if you die tonight, what would happen to you? Would you go to Heaven? Or would you go to Hell? Yeah, you heard me right, I used the H-word. There is a Hell. If you lead a sinful life, you will spend the rest of eternity in the fires of Hell. If you don't accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, you are doomed to eternal damnation. If you don't join our denomination, you'll suffer in the end. How long since you've heard a strong sermon on Hell? I mean a place where the fires are never quenched. Where conscious people spend a conscious eternity because they rejected Christ, suffering where there's no escape, no sleep, no way out. That is exactly what the Bible teaches about Hell and it outta be the fear of God that causes people to come running to the Savior. Fear not for there is salvation if you act before it's too late. Heaven is the antithesis to Hell. And the reward for all who accept Christ and choose the right denomination. Jesus is the ultimate Get Out of Hell Free card. The concept of Heaven was introduced by Zoroastrianism and imported into Judaism and later Christianity. But the popular vision of Heaven has taken on a life of its own. Heaven's a real place where real people spend a real eternity. And we outta be painting the picture of Heaven so real and so often that everybody would want to go there. Heaven is going to be, you can't even describe it. People can't describe it. It's, I don't know, the closest thing you can get is what it says in the scripture and that's just, amazing and beautiful and something we can't even really speak of. It's gonna be overlaid with gold and just all your dreams and more. There's going to be praising the Lord and worshiping him constantly. Heaven is going to be a wonderful place. I envision it like the Bible says. Golden streets, happy place. And peaceful. The popular vision of Heaven is strange in that it's filled with everything that people hate and is missing all that they love. People imagine and even look forward to a Heaven that they'll miserable in. As soon as the saved get to Heaven they will meet Saint Peter at the Pearly Gates and engage in some sort of witty banter with a hilarious punchline. And then they will be issued their uniform of wings, a halo and a harp. From this point on they'll spend the rest of eternity floating around lazily on white fluffy clouds, praying to the almighty, singing hymns and playing angelic melodies. Now, this may be all right for some, but how is the person who can't get on the airplane without two shots of vodka going to handle flying around and floating on a bank of clouds for all of eternity? Are people really going to enjoy this? After a couple of days of this bedlam, the average person will sell their soul to the devil for a little peace and quiet. And there's a reason that very few people play the harp on earth. It hurts your fingers. If people really wanted to prepare for Heaven, wouldn't they learn to read music, join the church choir, and take harp lessons? In Heaven all will be equal under God, with no class or rank, no racism, and no sexism. On earth however, everyone is racist. Whites are scared of blacks. Blacks don't trust Hispanics. And everyone hates the Jews. After all, the Jews killed Jesus. But even the most racist people think that when they get to Heaven, they will turn to one another and call them brother and sister. But then again, depending on whom you ask, there really won't be that many people there anyway. No one who doesn't accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior. So that knocks out the Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, Sikhs, Satanists, Atheists, Agnostics and a myriad of tribal religions. There won't be any gays. Anyone who's pro-choice. Anyone against prayer in school. Anyone who doesn't believe the world was made in six literal days. Democrats. Pedophiles. Women who don't obey their husbands, children who don't obey their parents. Or anyone who ever made a documentary critiquing Christianity. So in the end, Heaven will be a boring homogeneous group of straight, white Republican men. And this just goes to show that there will be much better company in Hell. On earth, men and women value sex above all else. They will risk life and reputation just for an opportunity to have sex. But in Heaven, there will be no sex. Horny men and women will lounge around on clouds day after day, eon after eon for the rest of eternity wishing they were in Hell where they could have a good shag. After all, isn't a Heaven without sex pretty close to Hell anyway? But this is the reward that awaits all who buy into the right religion. Accept Jesus today, repent your sins and you too can avoid the fires of Hell and live for all of eternity in a noisy, sexless, monotonous Heaven. Life is uncertain. And if you don't join the right religion before it's too late, you'll miss out on this once in a lifetime opportunity for eternal salvation. So act now, repent your sins and be born again. All evangelism is filled with a sense of urgency. It's important to save as many people as possible before the final deadline. Now think of those people you know who aren't saved. A coworker, your mother, your father, a spouse, your children. And think of their terrible fate. Now think of our neglect of duty. The most basic of deadlines is death. And since no one knows the hour of their demise, there's a constant cloud hanging over all our heads. New Catholic parents hurry to have their infants baptized before the unthinkable happens. And the elderly repent and return to the church of their youth before the inevitable happens. So you might ask, well Greg, that's all very interesting but what does that have to do with me? That means that life as you know it can come to an end. How? Well frankly we don't know what will happen next. Any one of us could be a victim of terrorism. Or a victim of violent crime. in these volatile times in which we live. I wish I could stand here today and say there'll never be another 9/11. There'll never be another Tsunami or another earthquake or another hurricane. I wish I could say to you, no one will ever die in a car accident or die of an illness again. But we live in a fallen world. And we know it will come to an end. Is the end of the world near? I don't know for certain. There are clearly signs of the times, but let me ask a different question. Is the end of your world near? There were people in this stadium last year that are not here tonight. Not because they didn't attend, but because they died. And next year, God willing if we're here again and the Lord has not returned, there'll be people here tonight that won't be here next year. We never know when life is going to end. As I often say, the statistics on death are pretty impressive. One out of every one persons will die. There are no exceptions. But even the youngest and healthiest among us have to face the apocalypse or end of times. Evangelists of all faiths share this dramatic deadline which is always close at hand. Peter said you remember back in the day of Pentecost, he said, this is that prophesied by the Prophet Joel. Well he had 3,000 people who accepted Jesus and 120 of them in the upper room got baptized in the holy spirit and he says, this is that. Well trust me, this is more that now than it was then. And if he was close to the end of the age then, we're a whole lot closer now than he was. This is that. We are seeing the end of the age. Believe in the prophetic end of times predates Christianity and has always been just around the corner. Jesus Christ told his disciples about the end times. Be careful that you are not led astray for many will come in my name saying, I am he. The antichrist is the embodiment of evil. Leader of the dark side and a sign of the apocalypse. Anyone can be the antichrist as long as they have a public profile, some degree of power, and are hated by enough people. Every Catholic Pope, every American President, and most major celebrities have been labeled the antichrist by those who hate them. But that's just the first part of the prophecy. And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be afraid. For this must first take place. But the end will not be at once. What will be the sign of the end, Lord? The end is not yet. For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom. There shall be great earthquakes and famines in many places. Since a close look at history reveals that almost every period of time has had wars, famine and earthquakes, the end of time has been at hand for close to two millennia. This has allowed every generation of evangelists to use the tragedies of the day to add urgency to their message. The world was ending during the crusades. The world was ending during both world wars. And the world is ending now. Are we living in the last days? With all that's happening in our world today, a lot of people are asking that question. Look at the recent earthquakes and the Tsunami along with the war in Iraq, the aggression of North Korea, the new nuclear capabilities that are being developed by Iran and now this war in Lebanon, and the continuing threat of global terrorism, not just from world nations like North Korea or Iran, but some terrorist group getting hold of one of these weapons and we can almost be certain they will try to use it. It's causing even the doubters to wonder, are these the end of times the Bible speaks of? Are we living in the last days? Is the end of the world near? Is Jesus Christ coming back again? I believe the end times are near. You know, things are happening on a daily basis. I believe those things that are happening, the floods, the earthquakes, the famine, the pestilence, all those types of things that are happening today are warnings from our Lord that the end times are near. They're trying to wake up people that don't know him that's saying, you need to get right with me because, you know, you may not have a chance if I come for my children. So, absolutely, these end times are definitely near. All the signs of end times are coming soon. Like the wars and nuclear things and terrorists and, I don't know, just crime's getting worse and we're definitely getting closer to end times. When will you return? A question that can push us toward future and Heaven and eternity. And the answer that's most often quoted, in my experience and in the experience of most of evangelical is the signs. That's really only part one of the answer to the question of the coming kingdom where there is apocalyptic doom viewed or blessed hope. The answer goes on as Matthew continues it, first, the kingdom will triumph in spite of wars, rumors of wars, pestilence and famines. Don't give up. Never lose hope. So these signs, in my judgment, are promises that the kingdom will triumph. Certainly not as predictors of when the kingdom will triumph. And many conservative Christians have it all charted out and exactly figured out. Everything is a sign of the apocalypse from the sexual revolution to September 11. From global turmoil to gay marriage. And from the microprocessor to Monica Lewinsky. Jerry Falwell was sure the world was going to end because of Y2K. In a Christian Guide to the Millennium Bug, he told his followers to stock up on food, gasoline, and ammunition. Because if there's one thing any good Christian needs, as they wait for the end times, it's a stockpile of weapons. It worked in Waco. There's even an online rapture index where the impatient can go to find out where the world ranks at the moment. The scores range from slow prophetic activity to fasten your seat belts. And rest assured, since both war and peace are listed as signs as well as common things like inflation, high oil prices and climate change, the end is always near. Let me give you what I think is the big picture of what's going to happen. I believe the next event on the prophetic calendar will most likely be the rapture of the church where all true believers will be called up to meet the Lord in the air. Some are waiting for a rapture where the righteous are beamed off the planet. Some are waiting for the second coming of Christ. And some are even waiting to be taken to Heaven in a UFO on the back of a comet. But no matter how one believes the end of times are coming, they are always sure they're gonna be saved. Well, almost always. In fact, for those who are sure they'll be saved and don't want their unsaved friends and family to worry, they can sign up at By putting in the names and email addresses of those you want to inform, a letter will automatically be sent out the first Friday after the rapture. This message has been sent to you by a friend or a relative who has recently disappeared along with millions and millions of people around the world. The reason they chose to send you this letter is because they cared about you and would like you to know the truth about where they went. This may come as a shock to you, but the one who sent you this has been taken up to Heaven... If you would like to give your life to Jesus Christ and be born again, it is not too late. And don't worry about your friends and family who are actually saved receiving this condescending letter. Based on sound Biblical prophecies, we know that they won't be able to check their email in Heaven. Whether one has a apocalyptic view, that is one of gloom and doom, or whether one has a kingdom view, of a kingdom to come in the future, either one can impact negatively in my judgment... How one fails to respond in the present. One of the most profound marketing tactics of all time is faith. Faith is the ultimate answer to the unanswerable. You have believed because you have seen me. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe. Imagine the brilliance of this response for religion, but one can hardly expect this to work on your average product. Yes, we have a caller from Riverside, California on the line, go ahead. How do I know this product is really what you say it is? Oh, you must have faith. Would you buy a product you'd never seen and don't know if it actually works just because someone tells you to? Probably not. But even the shrewdest consumers have been persuaded to have faith in a supernatural being and believe in the rewards and consequences of the afterlife without no proof. Faith without thought is superstition. A lot of people have faith. These people have followed Jim Jones down to South America. They had faith. Blind faith is, as I say, superstition. And we should question, we should look at and examine the things that we're supposed to believe. And if it doesn't work out, if we find out that those things aren't true, then we discount them, we get rid of them. We go the other direction. I believe the best thing for a professing Christian today is to use their brain. Otherwise, discerning people have come to believe that the Bible is literal, because it says so in the Bible, all through faith. The only reason I say Jesus Christ is the only way to the Father is because Jesus himself said it. How many of you brought your Bibles tonight, if you just grab it and hold it up, please. If you have a Bible, hold it up. Aw, that's a good sight. You hold in your hand, the most amazing book ever written. It's literally God's message to us. One striking fact about the United States, and it does differ from comperable societies in this respect, is the level of religious fundamentalism. I think about half the population, roughly, thinks the world was created 10,000 years ago, just as it is now with all the fossils and everything else. You don't get numbers like that anywhere else in comparable societies. The problem with fundamentalism is that it wants to take the Bible absolutely word for word almost as if Jesus spoke in the English language. Every word of the Bible is inspired, indeed, it is breathed by God himself. Second Timothy 3:16 says, all scriptures inspired by God... It actually means that every A, N, and V of the Bible is inspired. How can you believe that when we don't have a completed copy of the New Testament earlier than the 4th century? There isn't one there. And so there have been copies of them, and they have been changed through the years. One serious problem with the New Testament is that there are 5400 fragments of the 27 books in the New Testament. Except for small fragments, no two of them read the same. There are more than 300,000 variations in the text of the new testament. That's more words than there are in the New Testament. A translator sitting down with this, and every fragment he looks at says something different, the translator has to make an arbitrary judgment about which one is right. Now, that is not being an errant. That is being highly opinionated. I don't believe that everything in the Bible is true. The Bible believed that the world is flat. It talks about the four corners of the Earth. I don't believe that. Very few people do today. But I do believe in the inherent truth of the Bible in that it contains the word of God. I believe that it contains the truth of God. And I believe that Jesus was the son of God, but I don't necessarily believe that he became the son of God through the virgin birth. You see, this is based on the idea that, in the Book of Isaiah, it says a virgin will conceive. Well, the point about that is that the writer of the Book of Isaiah did not use the word virgin. He used the word young woman will conceive. And so, they took the idea of a virgin, and because every Roman emperor who was born professed to be born of a virgin. So, to reach the acceptability of that day back 2,000 years ago, that developed the concept of the virgin birth. The virgin birth is only found in Matthew and Luke. Mark is considered the earliest gospel to have been written. He doesn't mention it at all. Falty individuals wrote the Bible, and that is pretty apparent when you look at a lot of the contradictions that exist both in the old and the new Testament. Now, when you point that out to people who are true believers, they say, well, those aren't actually contradictions, they're only apparent contradictions. Or if you really press them, they say, well, that's not for us to know. God knows that, and it's not for us to know, so don't let that worry you. Well, of course, it worries everybody. Nevertheless, millions of people continue to believe that God said it, I believe it, that settles it. With this clever little logical fallacy, Christianity and other religions have been able to gloss over any logical inconsistencies. Faith is the one domain in which people are not called on to justify their beliefs through argument or debate. Personal faith that defies collective logic is even seen by many as a virtue. For more than two millennia, scholars have analyzed such profound topics as, how many angels can fit on the head of a pin, and did Jesus know the Earth was round? But questions such as, why do bad things happen to good people are sidestepped with the use of faith. So, everything else, from creation to salvation is important to understand, and a great deal of time is put into this effort. But fate is unexplainable. You must just have enough faith, and everything will be all right. And that's exactly what we're going to teach you how to do. How to share your faith effectively and Biblically to be able to reason with people, learn to circumnavigate or go around the person's intellect, the place of argument and speak directly to their conscience, to the place of the knowledge of right and wrong. That's what Jesus did, and it's incredibly powerful and effective. A perfect example of this is the modern faith healers. They claim to heal those who have enough faith in the name of Jesus. You shall be healed from this moment on, Kristi, what's God saying to you? There's a person out there, and you're having difficulty breathing, it's as though you can never get a full breath in your lungs. Well, the Lord is healing you from that right now. Somebody else has a fungus that has resisted any kind of medical treatment. At this moment, that fungus is just drying up and leaving your body. If they aren't healed, it's because they didn't have enough faith. You know what? That person who's having difficulty breathing, you're not receiving the healing that the Lord is giving you right now. You're sitting there and you're very skeptical, thinking that it's for someone else. Grab onto your healing and know that there is nothing impossible for the Lord, and that God is no respect as a person. So, as he speaks to you right now and says, you claim this healing, you claim it, you receive it and you believe it in the name of Jesus. Put your hand on your chest and just breathe as she says. In Jesus' name, may the blessing of the Lord attend you from this moment on. Amen. Amen. This faith healing isn't simply reserved for evangelists. You too can learn how to heal the sick. All you need is enough faith, and of course, a generous donation. Hello, this is Gordon Robertson of the 700 Club, welcoming you to the special teaching on how to heal the sick. For truly I say to you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, move hence to yonder place, and it will move. We know that faith can move mountains, but in all of recorded history, no one has ever moved a mountain with faith. So, apparently no one has enough faith. Once again, imagine faith working for any other market aside from religion. Yes? Yeah, this thing doesn't work. Apparently you didn't have enough faith. But faith isn't just something you have. It's who you are. There are men and women across America proclaiming that they are people of faith. But what does it mean to be of faith? Since very few people of faith tell us precisely what they mean, we're left to guess about this abstract concept. Faith is a very hot button word. Being highly abstract, it's difficult to define. I think a practical definition of faith is not what you say, but what you do. Unfortunately, when you try to build faith into a religion, and you tie that to certain kinds of performance, it becomes rather mechanical. And if you separate faith or confine it to language, per se, instead of action and what you choose to do, it becomes an absurdity. It's become a political force in recent years. It didn't used to be a political force. So, for example, nobody asked Nixon, let's say, whether he went to church every Sunday. Since Carter, every political candidate has had to at least pretend to be what they call a person of faith these days, meaning dedicated to some religion. That's new. And I think what happened is that, I don't think Carter intended it, but I think the Carter phenomenon convinced party managers that they could organize a big electoral block by just pretending to be religious extremists. And focusing on what are called values, the values, this means the particular concerns of the religious fundamentalist block. A big block in the United States, maybe a third of the population. So, by appealing to them, whether you believe it or not, you can mobilize a lot of votes. And therefore, you have things like this spectacle of Republican candidates trying to prove to evangelicals that, you know, my faith is a deeper part of my being, and his faith is, and so on and so forth. I mean, that doesn't happen in modern societies. But it does here. Based on the public statements by people proclaiming to be of faith, we can see that they're under attack. Even though 85% of the American public, every American president, supreme court justice, and member of congress, and most people throughout the world are people of faith, faith is under attack. The culture wars are raging. They are real. There are massive industries out there doing everything that they can to pollute our children and destroy our families. They're trying to destroy the moral fabric of our nation. Even evangelicals like to see themselves as a persecuted minority that has chosen to take the path less traveled. Even though they now have the power to help elect a president and to get their faith-based legislation passed, evangelicals like to see themselves as the underdog. So we are the primary tools that God will use to confront the negative influences in the culture war. Who would dare attack this overwhelming majority? Secularists, that's who. And since secularism is a lack of religion, this means religion is under attack from non-religion. Launched an all out assault on all the foundational principles of our nation. And we found our liberties on the strength of our religious belief. That's what the Declaration of Independence says, and the idea is, if you hate America, you will strip America of it's religious values. And those who are doing this, let's face it, this was a communist plan, some decades ago, to undermine America, break up families and break up religious belief, and then the country would be subject to Bolshevik or Marxist takeover. Well Marxism is in the ash bin of history but some of the Marxist followers in today's world are still carrying that agenda forward. The word secular is a very dirty word as far as fundamentalists are concerned in particular, because it's kind of like being in league with the devil. The fact that people could do something good on their own, to be intelligent, to be thoughtful, to be amoral without their eternal guidance, is very upsetting to them. And even more tragic than the moral denigration of our culture has been secularization. We, a nation under God with the help of the ACLU and federal courts and politicians and Hollywood and a national media that, in the main, has gone nuts, have been driven into secularization, becoming much like China and Russia and North Korea, a nation without God. And these liberal secularists have taken direct aim at sacred religious institutions. The media, except for Mel Gibson and Fox News, of course, are trying to pervert the next generation with sex, drugs, and secular music. Besides the Bible, you should be reading about what's going on, relevancy. One of the great, good things that's happened for the culture in recent years of America is Fox News Channel. It's not perfect by any means. Every now and then they bring some nut along, anything but the major three, four television networks, and CNN, if it's on there, I automatically don't believe it. The judges are trying to remove religion from public life through judicial activism also known as any ruling in favor of the ACLU. The scientists and professors from their ivory towers are trying to destroy the Garden of Eden by using science. Tearing down dignity, Judeo-Christian ethic and people send their kids to those schools and pay thousands of dollars every year for Godless professors to ruin 'em. I'll never understand it. I can tell you that fundamentalist religion frequently tells their students, don't take science because it will destroy your faith. In other words, the implication is, if you learn to think for yourself, you're in deep trouble, because we're gonna start looking bad. If you ever get to the point where you think that maybe the animals in the new world didn't swim across an ocean, to get aboard Noah's Ark so they wouldn't drowned in the flood, but that's a lot of nonsense, you know? Then you start questioning other things in your faith. So religion and science, dating clear back before Galileo has always been in contrast. The gays are trying to destroy marriage by, getting married. When you deal with people such as the gay-alternative lifestyle, individuals that don't quite fit into the same drumbeat as some of our standard churches, then even though they may be spiritual individuals, they have a hard time dealing with society. Simply because they feel like they're outcasts. And then all of a sudden you have the damage that can be done to these people when they try to have a relationship or raise a family or instill their beliefs on their children. All of a sudden there's a conflict between the church, their parents, their grandparents and their own spirituality. And so people pray. They pray to God so that their children might be saved and go to Heaven. They pray to confess their sins. They pray to ask for forgiveness. And they pray to ask for favors. Prayer is a kind of, 24/7 customer service line for those selling God. If you have any questions, comments, or requests you can reach God anytime. It is based on the idea that God has nothing better to do with his or her time than to listen to daily flattery from billions of people. In fact, with the entire universe to run, nothing makes God happier than sitting up there on his or her throne being praised. And if lucky, smelling the burnt meat from animal sacrifice. It is important to always thank God, even though humans do much of the work. People often thank God before they eat, but never offer their appreciation to the cook that prepared the food or the farmer that grew it. Although there are some selfless acts of prayer, most of the time the prayers appear to be for trivial, personal issues. Apparently when people can't find their car keys, they pray to God and ask for help. Or when they want to buy something they can't afford, they just ask God for it. Apparently, if you end any wish with amen, it's a prayer. For many people, it seems like God is a cross between a butler and a sugardaddy. If you listen to some, it appears that God is very populous in the answering of prayer. Apparently the more individuals praying for the same thing, the more likely it is to happen. America is the land of the free. Let's utilize our freedoms together, worship and pray by uniting with millions on our knees at noon Thursday, May 4th for The National Day of Prayer. In 2003, Pat Robertson attempted to lobby God with Operation Supreme Court Freedom. During this 21 day prayer offensive, Robertson and his television viewers asked God to remove Supreme Court Justices that were pro-choice and had struck down anti-sodomy laws. Two years later, Chief Justice William Rehnquist died while in office. Of course, since Rehnquist was one of the more conservative members of the court, this didn't change its direction. But that didn't stop Robertson from taking credit. It's important to note that this change in the courts composition was not a result of Rehnquist being an 80 year old man who had been battling cancer for several years, it was because of the prayer campaign. A cadre of evangelical stars joined together on one stage to hold Justice Sunday to help get the right judges on the bench. Our prayers and our involvement will shepherd well-qualified judges onto benches across this great land. Our children will best be served by judges who appreciate America's godly heritage. And can interpret the United States Constitution exactly as it is written. Our founding fathers, many of whom were great men of faith themselves, would expect nothing less. Welcome to Justice Sunday, a nationwide simulcast mobilizing people of faith for one of the most important challenges of our time. This movement is based on sound, Biblical principle. Blessed are those who get judges appointed to the bench that are pro-life and pro-death penalty; will protect marriage and protect guns; believe in intelligent design and don't believe in global warming; for they shall inherit the earth. Falwell 5:5. If one person prays for something, it isn't necessarily important. But if thousands of people pray for the same thing simultaneously, it must be worthwhile. So, pragmatically, if someone really wants a favor from God, it's in their best interest to do whatever it takes to get all of their family, friends and even total strangers to ask for it too. God is bound to listen to one of them. But what happens when God doesn't answer prayers no matter how many people petition him or her? The question remains, if it's God's will and God's will be done, then why do people need to pray in the first place? If their prayers aren't gonna have an impact on God's decision-making, then why not just sit back and wait for God's will to happen without prayer? For that matter, God gets the credit when good things happen that people never even prayed for. Through selective attribution, all good things are attributed to God and all bad things to the devil. No wonder people say that God is great and the devil is evil. They blame the devil for everything that goes wrong and praise God for everything that turns out great. God wants miracles for each person who's watching me right now. I believe miracles of finance, miracles in your family, miracles of protection against storms, miracles of healing. Introducing Pat Robertson's dynamic new book, Miracles Can Be Yours Today. I believe this book can transform your life and bring alive the faith that you say has grown cold. It'll rekindle your love of the Lord. Your miracle can happen now. Even acts of God aren't blamed on God. God doesn't cause these disasters but according to some, he or she does allow the devil to do his worst. Sometimes God can use tragedy and suffering to get our attention. God's always shaking us up. We always need it. We always need a good shaking up and you know, just 101 ways to do it, he's doing it. You know, whatever it takes to open your eyes and appreciate your life more, sooner. You know, bless him. Bless us. They believe that God let's these things happen to send us a message. Apparently prophets or email would be too subtle. You've got prophecies! When you're a deity, hyperbole is everything. After the terrorist attacks on September 11th, God's self-appointed spokesman, Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell blamed the ACLU, abortionists, feminists, and of course, gays. The ACLU's gotta take a lot of blame for this. Oh yes. I know I'll hear from them for this, but throwing God successfully with the help of the Federal Court System, throwing God out of the public square, out of the schools. The abortionists have got to bear some burden for this because God will not be mocked and when we destroy 40 million innocent little babies, we make God mad. I really believe that the pagan's and the abortionists and the feminists and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People for the American Way, all of them who tried to secularize America, I want point the finger in their face and say, you helped this happen. At least the Jews aren't blamed anymore. When Steve Lefemine of Columbia Christians For Life saw a satellite image of Hurricane Katrina, he saw an eight-week old fetus. It was clear to him that God was sending a message. I think Katrina's totally a sign from God. I think that it said we're going to have floods and fires and things are gonna happen that are gonna awaken us. I think those things are happening today. Absolutely. Reverend Bill Shanks of The New Covenant Fellowships in New Orleans summed up his theories for why God had allowed this to happen. New Orleans now is abortion free. New Orleans now is Mardi Gras free. New Orleans now is free of sodomites, the witchcraft workers, false religion. It's free of all of those things now. God simply, I believe, in his mercy, purged all of that stuff out of there and now we're gonna start over again. And Fred Phelps of the Westboro Baptist Church had a unique theory. He posted a very eloquent statement New Orleans sweltering in the sun without sodomites semen, putrid cesspool. Altogether appropriate that it be so because that's what New Orleans is and had been for decades. God couldn't be reached for comment but it's interesting to note that the French quarter where the Mardi Gras and Gay Pride Parade are held, was one of the few places that didn't flood. So apparently God doesn't hate the gays and hedonists in the French quarter, but does hate the poor black residents of the lower ninth ward. This disaster was in fact a message from God and that message is, don't live below sea level in a hurricane region. But people are bound to put their own spin on things. Was Hurricane Katrina caused by global warming or gays? Climate change or abortions? God always gets the credit or blame for everything from miracles to the mundane. God even got the credit for the grilled cheese sandwich that Diana Duyser made with a picture of the Virgin Mary on it. I would like to point out that there's not mold or disintegration. The item has not been preserved or anything. It has been kept in a plastic case, not a special one that seals out air or potential mold or bacteria, it is just like a miracle. It has just preserved itself which in itself I consider, a miracle. She put the divine sandwich on eBay and sold it to an online casino for $28,000 making her a role model in the art for selling God. Or at least, selling God's mother. Impact a group of people, call it the modern Christian Church who believe that God is not arbitrary, vengeful or severe, empowers one to love unconditionally, to be incredibly tolerant and accepting of divergent views, the impact those people can have, by expressing their faith through love, is world changing. It's not just social justice, that's the easy part to say. It includes social justice, but it's tolerance, openness, the willingness to admit that they could be wrong and yet will test everything to see some measure of truth in it. Clearly religion... And concomitantly spirituality calls the individual self to find meaning, to find purpose, to find identity, to find acceptance, and to experience hope. That anchors who we are. That helps us to make sense out of the universe. That helps to cover our nakedness. Something I call the cosmic, phew. People just feel alone, isolated, afraid. Well religious commitment gives you a way out of this. I think the essence of the role of the modern Christian Church is to make known the character nature of God. He's not the kind of character his enemies have made him out to be. He's not arbitrary, vengeful, or severe. And so that has to make itself known from the people who believe that by expressing that faith through love. Martin Luther King phrased it this way. Any religion that professes to be concerned about the souls of persons, but is not concerned about the slums that damn them, the economic conditions that strangle them, and the social conditions that limit them, is a dry as dust religion. Religion is ever personal but never private. So that then calls us to say okay beyond the individual, grounding and acceptance experience and meaning perceived, what am I called to do and be in this time and in this place? If it's meaningful for people, if it enriches their lives, if it gives them sense of community, gives them something to hope for or ways of identifying with others, it can be very helpful, even though irrational. On the other hand, it can be dangerous. If it becomes a force that's used against others, it can be extremely dangerous. Well I think the role of the church is to, you know, take the comfortable and comfort the irritated And to reflect the values of Jesus in the preaching. And in their living. I think the church has a tremendous responsibility today in enabling people to live life to its maximum. Societies rise and fall, not only on the battlefield but in the hearts and minds of people. The clash of cultures between Islam and Christianity, between Protestantism and Catholicism will not be solved in the hills of Afghanistan or the streets of Ireland. The clash of cultures and the battle of religions will be fought from the pulpits, over the airways, and on the doorsteps of people around the world. Every sermon delivered and every Bible study given is a shot fired in the battle for your devotion. It is a fight not just for your soul but for the survival of every church and denomination. Selling God is the only way for religion to survive. And having informed consumers is the only way for society to survive. Tonight's televangelist Pat Robertson is raising the eyebrows to some fitness experts with claims of his near superhuman strength. Robertson, on his Christian broadcasting network website claims to leg press 2000 pounds, a ton. The website attributes the feat of strength to his so-called age defying protein shake. Get one of those. But experts say lifting just a thousand pounds would be difficult for even the strongest athlete and almost impossible, if not impossible, for a man in his 70s. The video on the website appears to show him lifting a thousand pounds. The website says the video is from 2003 when Pat Robertson was 73 years old. You have to do the show tomorrow. I'm just gonna take it up to 900 pounds. I'm 74 years old, Kristi. That's only 900 pounds. And perfect. Look, there's no more room. No more room, this will be 1000 pounds.
