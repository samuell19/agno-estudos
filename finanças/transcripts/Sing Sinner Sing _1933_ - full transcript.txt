This way, folks, to the Queen of Joy where Lady Luck winks a wicked eye, and the glorious girl of the golden west will croon and sing on the happy ship with Kansas King. You know where to wait. Stay out of sight, and don't let Cecily see you. Hey, hey, taxi! Confound it! Why didn't you hold it? Sorry, sir, it's full. Yeah, well, so am I. Don't spill it. You wait here. Teddy will pay you. Hey! Hey! Teddy, yoohoo! Yoohoo, Teddy! Wait for me, Teddy. Here I am. I think it was hard of you to run way when you promised to take me to the Queen of Joy and let me gamble. I just love to gamble. My father's father was a gambler until he got shot in excitement after you brought them here. Yeah, but-- But you see gambling just runs in my blood. And because it's red, blood I mean, I always play the red. That's when I don't play the black. Listen-- Because my girlfriend Dorothy told me all about it. You stand on 16, never open the pot with less than a pair of aces, always play the middle column in the middle dozen. Or maybe it's the middle dozen in the middle column. Anyhow, Dorothy's boyfriend gave her $500 and she ran it up into a sable coat. So if you'll give me $500, I'll run it up into a sable coat and maybe a Rolls Royce too. Oh, will you please go home? I don't want to go home You promised me I could gamble. And it's not very nice of you to keep breaking your promises when you keep promising you'll keep your promises. Yeah but tonight, some other night, but not-- You said that every night for a week, Teddy. And then you run away and leave me, and the next day rave about how wonderful that court singer was. Yeah, but now if you'll go back to Hollywood I'll send you tomorrow-- I don't wanna go back to Hollywood. I wanna gamble like you promised me I could. So if you'll give me 500-- ahhhh! Fish nearly got her that time! Yeah, here's another sucker. Gotta catch that rhythm. Gotta catch that swing. Kiss me on the upbeat. Don't miss that thing. Oh, there's nothing harmful. Grab yourself an armful, and let that rhythm lead you home. Catch that rhythm. Catch that swing. Get right with them, don't do that thing. Oh! Get real playful. Make your stable Let that rhythm lead you home. Because there's nothing that's harmful. Grab yourself an armful. Let that rhythm lead you home. Don't forget to slow down, if you feel it slow down, moving up and down your play. Go out and get a drum to beat on. Turn a lot of heat on. Take your weary weariness away. Oh, catch that rhythm. Got to do that swing. Get right with them. Got to do that thing. Oh, it's nothing harmful. Grab yourself an armful. Let that rhythm lead you home. You don't have to tear me to pieces I'd love to. Darling, you were singing like a million tonight. I never sang worse in my life. Hey, what's the matter? Oh, I don't know. Just tired I guess. Oh we'll give ourselves a vacation one of these days. I've heard say that before. It won't be long now with money coming in like it is. Come on up. Here. Can I help it if business is good? Hey, don't you ever get tired. That's just my way of showing how much I love you. Now, that's better. Run along now, won't you, Phil. I want to rest before I go on again. I adore looking at you, darling. Sometimes I almost believe you. You have the sweetest way of calling me a liar. All right, sweet. We'll get away next week sure. Here's the wire I sent in when he left on a trip. Just keep on gaining momentum. But never your foot don't slip. We're wasting time here. Barbara is at the other game winning just oodles of money. I'm set with $500. And the first time I play, I'll bet 100. And if I lose, I'll bet 200. And then I'll play all that I've got plus another hundred. So that when I win, I'll win back all that I loss plus the extra hundred that I win. But of course I'll win, because last night, I saw the moon over my right shoulder, and that's a certain sign of good luck. Oh, not that I'm superstitious, but my uncle Peter once had a dream that he won. And the next day-- He shot himself in the excitement. Oh, Teddy, you're so funny. Hello, Maggie. How are the feet? They ache. Damn near strangled me. And did I try 'em tonight? Boy, did my pipes wobble like a circus calliope beep, beep, beep. Ooh, isn't that a rasp. Good, it's my voice full of razor blades and salt air. Poor darling, you're practically dying. It's only my professional pride keeps me going, Torchie. That's right, Maggie, the show must go on. The show is on. And I got something for you. A note. Here! Here! That's the note the Rendon millions gave me to give you this note. The eyes are going out on me just like the dogs. I'll have to get glasses for 'em. The dog? No the eyes. Well he's persistent. I'll say that for him. And not bad looking. Oh I don't know. Hey, a wax dummy with half his jaw would look like Clark Gable to me. You say no to the opportunity of a lifetime, and yes to guy like Phil Carida. I don't get you at all. I get myself. The way Phil dizzies around with every good looking flicker he sees gives me a pain. And it ain't my feet either. You know, if I had your face and figure, I wouldn't waste my time torching on a ship like this. And what would you do, Mr. Bones, if you had my face and figure? Grab myself a millionaire. Maybe I will. Just as I've always told you, dearie. You've got what the chiropodists call poise. I got bunions. But I don't want to play with those stupid little square blocks that has dots all over that you talk to like this. Baby needs a new pair of shoes. Oh it's the most fascinating game, and I know how-- Listen, where I'm going you can't go this evening, but when I come back. Ahh, but when I come back. Hello, Debbie. All right, hello. But am I burnt up. What's the trouble, honey. I get myself all set for a fat commission on that fool, and I can't even get him into a game. Give me a yard, and we'll call it square. If he plays you save 10%. Lasting with that guy all week isn't even worth it now. I asked you for a hundred. You only gave me 50. For that we can go to the chest. Oh yeah. Well, you just try riding in a car with that guy sometime. Why, do you know what happens-- OK. OK. You win. Hello Hey, you can't come in here. Ohhh, I-I-I am in here. I knocked first. Say Did-did-did you get my-- did you get my note? Yeah. The answer is still no. Oh. You know? You know, if-if-if I had you, I'd take you to Paris. Yes but you haven't got me. A Rendon never takes no for an answer. Yeah, so you said in your note. Aww come on. Let's get serious, huh. Let's-- Let's get off of this boat and go places and do things, huh. You know, big things, everything. Say I'll tell you what. I'll take you back to New York with me. It was Paris a minute ago. Oh, I mean it. I'm crazy about you. You're drunk. Sure I'm drunk. I'm always drunk. But I'm crazy about you just the same. Aww come on give us a little kiss, will ya? Just, just-- You better sit down before you fall down. Yeah. Yeah, that's a good idea Gee. Gee, but you're good to look at. Haven't you ever seen a blonde before? Millions. But n-n-never anybody like you. Oh come on, say yes. I-I-I got lot's of money. All the money in the world. And I could make you happy too. You could make me happy. I wonder what you'd be like sober. Say, I'll, I'll try it. I'll try anything for you. But would you say yes? Oh, now you're starting that again. Oh, come on. Give in-- No I believe you mean no. Yes I mean no. Yes you mean no? No! You mean yes. Aww, darling. Hey, Torchie, you're on. Oh, pardon me. Well, happy landing. Yeah I'll, I'll be waiting for you. Don't you be here when I get back. All right. Sure I'll go. Get out of here! Hey up there. Give us a hand here, will ya? What do ya got? Half a dozen sacks from the local OK, commandant. Where is-- Stand by. Hey, you fellas keep out of sight like I told you. As soon as we get the dough up to Phil's office, I'll tip you off. About 10 minutes later, you pull the stickup. Look, make it-- make it look tough for me because if Phil thought I was in on this, he'd kill me cold. That guy ain't bulletproof, is he? No, don't make any mistakes and take a crack at me. Just you do your stuff, Louis, and we'll do ours. Yeah, all right. He's as nervous as a June bride. Yeah, that dirty double-crosser. Rendon is here. Sky is the limit if you play. OK, boss. I'll pass the word. How are the figs, Spats? Oh about 7 or 8 Gs. Not bad for a Thursday night. Not bad for any night. Here comes Louis. It's about time. You'd think he owned this. Business interfering with pleasure again, Louis? Oh, don't ride me, Phil. I ought to drink a rotten gin. Stretch me out. Now help Spats to get this stuff up to my office or I'll stretch you out. I'll be around later to check up on you. Check up on me? On both of you. That's the third time you used that rotten gin excuse. What was she, a blonde or a brunette? A redhead. I'll be listening sweetheart. Who can figure out the ending? Who can say how this began. What's the use in life pretending? Here I am and he's my man. He isn't handsome or clever, but still he's mine. He'll keep me worried forever, but still he's mine. He likes to lie and cheat me I've found. He likes to try and boss me around. Till even I who love him am found to hate him. Hello Hello yourself, big man, and see how it feels. For getting with someone new. But find it isn't so easy a thing to do. I don't know how it happens or when, but soon we're back together again. I know he's worthless, but, just the same, he's mine. Let the encore. Phil! Phil! Honey! Hello sweetheart. I was just putting together a sketch for Sadie. You're a fast liar, Phil. Honest, Lela, he was just showing me a gig that's going in the new number. I saw the workout. Now you get out. Oh, now listen, honey. There is nothing to get all steamed up about. Well I'm fed up, sick of it all. You know you don't mean that. No, I'm quitting Saturday. No you're not quitting. We are going on our vacation Saturday. I'm through. No you just think you are. Keep your hands off me. You're jealous. I love it. I'll go on and ask Phil. You'll help me get this stuff up to the office. What do you think I am, a gray? All right Take that. Say, can't we tickle Louis' split and forget about thirds? Well, if he sort of slipped and fell overboard, we could do a fifty. Now that's an idea. Why split with a double-crosser. 100. 500. Who is it? Jerry Open it, quick! It's Jerry. What's a matter. Conley found the ship. We're doomed for a stickup. Go get Phil. We'll put the stuff away first. OK. Listen, you keep this door locked. If anybody tries to crash in, let him have it. All right. Turn around, rat. Drop it. Face the wall, and keep your hands up. I'm quitting, walking out on you. You're not through with me. And you're not walking out on me. Say, are you kidding me? I was never more serious. Then I want to tell you something. I'm not interested. Oh yes you are, sweetheart. No one can double-cross me and get away with it. You would say something like that. Yes I would. If you want to leave this floating joint, OK. But you're leaving with me. Here I am. Greetings. How did he get in there? Uh, excuse me. I-I-I must have fallen asleep. What was he doing here with you? Hey, what are you insinuating anyway? It's all right. It's all right. I'll fix him. Trying to put something over on me, weren't you? Well, I'll fix him. Don't, Phil, don't. He doesn't know what he's doing. He's drunk. Please Get out of here. Please go. All right. Who is it? It's me, Spats. Open the door. What do you want? Conley's on board. It looks like a stickup. They just got Jerry. Where's the money? It's in the safe. I'll be right up. OK. Now forget it, honey. I'm wrong. I just lost my head. I'll be back in a minute, and we'll have a heart-to-heart talk. Eh? Where is that guy, anyhow? A horse on us, and a hearse for him. -Who is it? -Spats. Open the door. Come on. Come on. I'll get it. Where's Jerry? Gone, I guess. He's still breathing. Maybe there's a doctor on board. I'll go and see. No you'll stay right here. What do you want to do, start a panic? But maybe the guy is dying. You seem to be in an awful sweat about it. I'll tip them off in the game room. The first guy-- What guy? Why, Conley, and whoever's with him. Oh. Spats. Yes sir? What did Jerry say? He just crashed and then said Conley was on board. Did he mention anybody else? No How did you know anybody was with Conley? Conley would never pull a stickup alone would he? Maybe not. Well, what are you riding me for? You seem to be kind of nervous. What kind of a crack is that? You aren't afraid of a little lead are you? Lead isn't funny. OK, Louis, forget it. I'm sorry. But listen boys. We are American citizens running a legitimate business. We are entitled to protect ourselves. Is this right Louis? Yeah that's right. Open the safe. Have you gone nuts? Conley is liable to be here any minute. You know a lot about Conley, don't you? It's gone. Say-- I'll do the talking. Well? I-- I. Where is it? Under that desk. Get it back. Put it in that safe. So you were playing with Conley, sold me out. Well, what are you going to do? Do? Geez, Phil, don't! Go ahead, whine. What do we do with them? Into the next cabin. Jerry too. Hello, hello, hello, hello. Get your stuff off this ship before something happens to you. -All right, all right. We'll leave together. Just come on. I got a boat waiting. Oh, you must be crazy. Sure I am. I'm Crazy about you. I'm in a hurry. Come on. Let's get married. Huh? Married? Sure, sure, why not? You don't know what you're talking about. Oh, so-- so you think I'm drunk. Don't you? But you don't know anything about me. I know all I want to know and that's enough. What about your family? My family's in Europe. Let's fool 'em, huh? Yes, I will. Swell. Come on. Lel, can I borrow some of your-- Oh, pardon me. Good bye, Maggie. Were are you going? To get married. And I'm going to be my own best man. Champagne. Hey, girls! Hey, girls! The Torch just grabbed herself a millionaire. What do you mean? Lela just walked out with the Rendon millions. Why don't you go Hollywood and grab yourself a bankroll. I don't see it's done you any good. I got everything she ever had. Yeah, I know a couple of guys who don't think so. I had my eye on that guy myself. Hey, Thompkins! I wonder where that guy is. Can't we use this boat? Oh, well-- well sure I guess so. Wait-- Wait a minute and I'll see. Hey, hey, you There's a drunk in there. You know some people never know enough to stop drinking. Ask your man to hurry, will you? Hey! Hey, Thompkins! Well hurry up, will you? Be there in a minute. He-- He'll be here in a minute. I'm telling you we're sitting on a load of dynamite. And when it goes off, it ain't gonna be funny. I suppose you mean Phil. Yeah I mean Phil! You mean Phil what? Ooh. Scram Where's Lela? I don't know. Was Rendon in here again? Rendon? Rendon?

Hurry up, Thompkins. Just in Come on. We're all set. Lela! Lela, wait! You can't double-cross me and get away with it. Keep your mouth shut. Just act like we're taking a little walk. Come on. Snap out of it. Anything you say, boys. There's nothing personal in this, Phil. Sure just a friendly little visit. Friendly if you don't get smart. You picked the wrong time. Nothing but pikers tonight. Yeah? Go ahead and open the safe. Nothing in it. I have to phone the gaming room if you're in a hurry. Who's in the cage? Louis and Spats Tell them to bring the dough up here. And take care what you say. All right. Spats. No. What? No, I want Spats, yes Spats. Whoopie! Ahh, Good, huh? Hello. Oh, Mrs. Rendon. I'll see if he's here. What? No, Mr. Rendon is not here. A Ms. Flannigan to see you, Madame. Flannigan? Ms. Margaret Flannigan. Oh! Maggie! Torchie! Oh! Gee, I'm glad to see you. Yep, you're a lady. I always said that torching on that rag wasn't up your alley. I can't help it, dearie. I walked out here from the station and my dogs are singing the holy bow wows. Should I dismiss the car, Madame? No. Send the car to the station for Ms. Flannigan's luggage? Uh, this is Ms. Flannigan, Robert, an old friend of mine. How do you do? And how's your grandmother? I beg your pardon? Skip it. I beg your pardon? Just plain old skip it. That will be all, Robert. Yes. Well, did you see the look he gave me? You should see some of the looks he gives me. Oh yeah? Yeah. I suppose everything you do is wrong. Practically everything. But I'm learning. For instance, one should not remove one's shoe in the reception hall. And, for instance, five a day on the subway circuit will make one not give a damn, for instance. So, that's what you've been doing. Yes, dearie. And how. Boy, what a life. Just colossal. Oh, this is so soft. Maggie when did you leave the ship? -The night you left. -Why? What happened? Well, yes and no. It seems there was a little shooting that busted up the show. Racket was all over. Spats closed the hatches and threw everybody out. He said Phil was giving up the ship. You didn't see Phil? Why should I want to see that tin horn? Then you don't know where he is. I don't care where he is. I wish I knew. Now why worry about him? Well, he said I couldn't get away with it. But you did. Haven't you? I wonder. Oh well, he's there and you're here. Now skip it and tell me the dirt. Where's moneybags? Meaning Ted? Now who else would I mean? He's out. Alcoholically speaking? Yes. He's drunk nearly all the time. How much are you going to nudge him for? A million? Well I haven't thought about it. Well, that's why you married him ain't it? Yeah, it would think that way wouldn't it? And what a way. Well, the longer you stick, the more you're entitled to. Well, dearie. Where do I park the I'll put you in the blue room. The blue room? I'd feel much more at home in the gold. The gold room, dearie. Get me? Sounds like Ted. The place is yours! We're going to party! Hi, Angel. I came especially to see you. Well, well, oh Horseface, hi, I'm glad to see you. Hello, sucker. -What's that? -Skip it. Just plain old skip it. Ted. Ted. Sure, sure, I've been drinking. It's our anniversary, don't your remember? Exactly six weeks today. Come old mush-mouth, let's have a drink, huh? I really must say no. My liver. Oh. Well, that's too bad. Yeah, well, I'll see you around. So long, gorgeous. No more tonight. Oh, no, no. You know me. Did I say a million, Torchie? Say, when I go on that witness stand, I'll paint a picture of mental cruelty that will get you two million and not a cent less. Through the key whole with I. Spy. What family of bluebloods is rushing homeward from the Riviera to rescue what Long Island Playboy, who hasn't been reformed by his marriage to what beautiful torch singer? And what beautiful torch singer-- and is she-- is earning every cent she'll get when the family turns its battery of legal lights on a hasty midnight marriage. Say, she's a smart girl. I'll bet she'll get plenty. Send the dice playing fellow $100. What again? Again. Boy, I bet he believes in Santa Clause. Did you get the time table? Yeah. What does it say? sends us Friday. Arrive in New York the fourth day Tuesday. Listen the doctor says-- Forget what the doctor said. We're getting out of here. With all the frills you can have, I'll be hanged if I see why you keep yourself steamed up about that torch. She ran out on me, Spats. And I have some business to settle with that husband of hers too. Where, where, where, where is she? In there. Oh, there you are, baby. What-- What's the matter. Old Horseface says you're hurt. I don't see where you're hurt. Ted, you promised me you wouldn't drink tonight. Oh, it's a promise between pals. Don't take any more, please. You know what it does to you. Listen, let's-- let's drink and be merry. It's our anniversary. And I'm going to get drunker and drunker. Sure that's an idea. We'll join you. What? In there? Sure. A drink's a drink ain't it, even in a bathroom? Oh that's old bathroom philosophy, old Horseface. Maggie, he'll be mad. Let me out of here! Let me out of here! Mad? He's furious. Let me out of here or I'll bust the door down. Let me out of here. You hear me? Let me out of here. Let me out of here. Let me out of here. Let me out of here, I tell you. All right. All right. What's the idea locking me in? I gotta have another drink. You can't have anymore tonight, Ted. -Oh, who said so? -I do. Listen, I'm going to drink all I want and nobody's going to stop me. You get out of my way or I'll break your neck. Listen to me. Please, Ted, you're killing yourself. All right I'll kill myself, and I'll kill you too. Come on Teddy boy. Who are you? Now don't tell me you've forgotten old Horseface. Oh, hello old Horseface. Yeah, you're a good old scout. You like me, huh? Sure, sure. You like me too? Just crazy about you. Let's play rough, huh? OK, baby. It's a lot of fun, huh? Sure. Whoopie. Take this to bed with you. Maggie! You're a cinch to marry a cinch. You can go to court right now. Oh the poor kid. Oh, yeah? Well I'm sorry for him. The least I can do is try to help him after all he's done for me. What has he done for you? Try to choke you. Oh, he didn't mean that. Let him make a jury believe he didn't. Did I say two million, dearie? You're in the bag for five. I'll light it you, dear. Thanks. You know, last night sticks with me just like a crazy nightmare. When I'm-- When I'm that way, I don't know what I'm doing. I'm sorry. On the level I am. I wouldn't hurt you. You know that. I know you wouldn't. I was just crazy out of my mind. Well then right now would be a good time to stop. You've proven you can twice. Think what it would mean, Ted. Oh I want to. I've tried to, but I-- I just can't. I know you can, and you must. You can't keep up the way your going. It will get you just one place, and that's the grave. I beg pardon. What is it Roberts? You're aunt and uncle are in the drawing, sir. Oh. Tell them I'll be down in a moment. Very good, sir. Better go in alone. Yeah. Listen. Nothing they say will make any difference as far as we're concerned. All this girl wants is your money. And to save you, you young fool, we're willing to buy her off. Oh, so you're willing to buy her off? She will doubtless consent to an annulment. And what makes you think that? They always do. You shut up. Listen to me, you young idiot. You married far beneath you, a torch singer from a gambling ship, a person unfit to carry on the Rendon tradition. Well it's perfectly obvious my boy, this girl wants only your money. Well she can have it. And anything else I've got too. Oh no, she can't. We control your money, and we'll never release Trusteeship so long as she's your wife. I suppose she told you who she was and what she was before you married her. I didn't ask her. She tried to and I would listen. And I don't want to hear anything now. Well you're going to. Give me that report. Did you hear of Phil Carida? I know all about that. You know that she lived with him before she married you? Without benefit of clergy. Do you want a woman of her character to besmirch the Rendon ancestry, a line that comes down through history? To a lot of drunken rotters. Look at me, I'm a Rendon. Am I anything to be proud of? No! Though I'm a drunkard. And my father was one, and your father was one. Ha! The Rendon ancestry! You don't know what you're talking about. Oh, don't I? Well let me tell you this, I don't care what my wife was. That's all over with. But I do know this much, she's the only one who ever really tried to make something out of me. Did you? No, you beat it off to Europe when I got to be too much for you. You ran out on me! Well she hasn't. She's stuck by me, and I'll stick by her! Oh, your mad. Don't I know it? I know the taint that runs through this family. Ha! My grandfather died in an insane asylum. Yeah and end there too. That's why I drink all the time, to forget it. That's all I can ever think about, going crazy. Now you get out. Get out! Get out of here! Do you hear me? Get out all of you! It's all that woman's fault. She put you up to it. Get out of my house! Through the keyhole into the intimate lives of the people you hear about, read about, and talk about. What local playboy resumed his endurance jag two days ago, when what irate uncle and aunt dug up what beautiful torch singer's past? And what radiant little blonde is helping to forget and forget and forget? You can see them any evening in certain-- and how he does. Go early ladies and gentlemen and avoid the crush. Where does it hurt you, dearie? Listen angel, you're letting a soft heart interfere with business. Oh, poor kid. Oh, skip it. You know he's left you flat like that guy in the movies tonight. And that spells desertion with capital dollar markets. Golden dollars. Gee, that would make a swell movie title w wouldn't it? Desertion, divorce, alimony. I can see the jury now, weeping as they look you sitting in the witness chair. Dressed all in black, plain black, Torchie with a touch of white for purity, and just enough color in your face to make you beautiful and tragic, like Camille. Gee, that's an idea. You can develop a cough. Hey! What's that? It sounds like a band. A band? Band in. Bent him. Ted Crock. Crock killer. Careless girl. Girl evidence. Evidence alimony. Gee, everything I think of ends in money. Money! Hotcha! Hey, Ted. Look who's here. Oh, hello, wife. Come on let's go up and play. Get up, Ted. Get up. Oh, don't cramp my party. Come on. Get up, Ted. I want to talk with you. All right. You don't have to yell about it. I've got a lot of things to talk with you about too. Go on and amuse yourself. I'll be back in a few. Aww, Teddy. Ahh, foo! I'll sue you, you little boudoir. Try and snap out of it, will you. Maggie, come on help me. It's all right, Horseface, I don't need your help going up stairs. Ted. Listen to me. Who does she think she is anyway, taking Ted away from me. I won't stand for it! Sure, she's only his wife. Right on the couch, Maggie. This is worse than I've ever seen him. There's nothing wrong with him a stomach pump won't cure. Find Roberts, and tell him to phone for a doctor. Oh let him sleep it off. Please do as I tell you, Maggie. All right, dearie. All right. All we need now is a police raid to make me feel right at home. You're taking an awful chance going in there with a party going on. I'm finishing my business here tonight. Here, have the motor running. Mr. Rendon is ill. I'll have to ask you to leave. Is that so? What's the matter with him He was all right when you took him upstairs. Yeah, well he's sick now. I don't believe it. Well, whether you believe it or not, you'll have to get out. Say, are you ordering us out of the house? Yes, that's just what I'm doing. Do you hear that? She's telling us to get out. Ted invited us here, and we're going to stay until he tells us to leave. Is that right gang? Yeah! Just you try and put us out! Robert. Yes, madame. I've asked these people to leave. See that they do so. Yes, Mrs. Rendon. You people uh, enjoying yourselves? Oh but that's nice. Ted! -Get away from me -Give me that gun. Get away from me I tell you. Give me that gun, please. I'm gonna do it. Please, Ted. And I'm gonna kill you too. Are we gonna let her ruin our party? No! We want Teddy. Let's go get him. We want Ted! We want Ted! We want Ted! We want Ted! We want Ted! We want Ted! We want Ted! We want Ted! We want Ted! We want Ted! We want Ted! We want Ted! We want Ted! We want Ted! We want Ted! WE want Ted! And you phoned for the doctor? I told Frozen-face to do it. And who might Franzen-face be? The Butler. You returned to the room immediately? No my dogs ached-- I'm not interested in your feet, Ms. Flannigan. Let it pass. Will you please answer my question. Sure, what was it? Did you return to the room immediately? No my dogs ached, and I stopped to rub 'em. They cramp when I get excited. Then you were excited. Why? Why not? I'll tell you why. You knew when she sent you out of the room, that she was going kill him. Was you there, Charlie? Charlie? -Ah, skip it. -What? Just plain old skip it. How much did Mrs. Rendon expect to get out of this marriage. It was worth at least five million buck in my opinion. I'm not asking your opinion. How much did she expect to get? What do you think Charlie? I'll see Mrs. Rendon. That will be all Mrs. Flarady. Flannigan! Ms. Margaret Flannigan to you, stooge. And to you too, you old futz. Don't tell them anything, dearie. Make 'em guess. Will you be seated, Mrs. Rendon. How long did you know Ted Rendon before you married him. A few weeks. Was he sober at the time? Well, he said he knew what he was doing. That isn't answering my question. He was not sober. You knew who he was. Well, yes. You knew that he would inherit many millions. Yes. And of course that's why you married him. Did your husband know of your, uh, relations with Phil Carida. Yes. You told him? I tried to tell him, but he said he knew all about him. Mr Rendon's guests state that you forced him to leave them and go to your room. Yes. For what purpose? Well he was drunk. I have affidavits which prove that he was sober. But they're not true. After getting your husband to your room, you sent that the Ms. Flannigan to phone for a doctor. Yes. And you locked the doors when she left the room. No. The guests say the doors were locked. They had to break in. How do you explain that? I can't. Then you did lock those doors. No, no I didn't. And brought to you through the courtesy of the Evening Star. We now return you to Countess Theodosia Androslovska who will resume her intimate glimpses of the Rendon murder trial. Hello everybody. Before I forget it, I simply must tell you about her hat. It was something like a turban, but yet not a turban. Now was it a beret? It was a-- now let me see, what would I call it? Dear, dear, there I go again. But one could see that the whole thing was thought up with the idea of impressing the jury. That's I'm telling you about it. But it didn't work this time. The evidence was so overwhelmingly against her that I don't see how any jury could do anything else, but find her guilty. Spats? Yeah, I'm here. It looks like the chair for her all right. Yeah, she'll burn. She saved you a lot of trouble by bumping him off. Yeah. I wonder why she did it. Women are funny that way. Want me to mix you one? What? Yeah, stiff one. COUNTESS THEODOSIA ON RADIO: One could easily see it was a French model, and very expensive one too, but seriously I must get on with the trial. The poor dear, she looked so worn and haggard. I felt so sorry for her. I could have cried right on the spot, in spite of the fact that she must be guilty. Have you reached a verdict, ladies and gentlemen of the jury? We have, your honor. The prisoner will rise. The jury will look upon the prisoner. The prisoner will look upon the jury. Proceed. We the jury find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree. I'm gonna kill her! I'm going to kill her like I killed your baby-faced husband. He took you away from me. Well, I took him away from you. I killed him in his own gutter, and I'm going to get to you some-- After all, dearie. You were his wife, and entitled to something. Maybe not five million. But with the right kind of a lawyer and me on the witness stand. A million would have been a setup, a cinch. And what do you do? Walk right out of the place with even a teaspoon! And they did have such lovely silverware. You know, Maggie, I have the strangest feeling. So have I, in my dogs. I don't believe Phil killed Ted. Ted committed suicide. I know he did. I had hardly closed the door before I heard the shot. And I came right out and saw him lying there. Well if Phil didn't do it, why did he put on that grand shooting act in the courtroom and try to kill you? He didn't try to kill me. That's just what it was, Maggie, an act. He did that so they'd believe what he said. Well, he sure made it stick. You're on, dearie. He isn't handsome or clever, but still he's mine. He'll keep me worried forever, but still, he's mine. He likes to lie and cheat me I've found. He likes to try and boss me around, til even I who love him am bound to hate him. Hmm. Mmm. I do my darndest for getting with someone new, but find it isn't So easy a thing to do. I'll carry on with his melody, because he's gone and now I can see that in his fashion he must have called it love.
