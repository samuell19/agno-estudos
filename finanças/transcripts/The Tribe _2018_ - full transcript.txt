I can do a whole floor in half a shift. You won't risk losing me, will you? Don't think you're so good. Coffee with stevia and a dab of cream. And sparkling water. I'm one of the 300 people you put on the fucking street. How does it feel to ruin someone's life? I had to send my family back to the village. Now, I'm living in a shitty boarding house. You can disguise yourself, but I know who you are. I served you coffee every morning! With stevia and a dab of cream! Sorry. -You're Fidel. -Yeah. Sorry, I'm Virginia. Your mother. -Your biological mother, I mean. -Right. -You're soaking wet. -I know. Shall we sit down? -No. -Why? I'm sorry, but coming here wasn't a good idea. We can go somewhere else. I proposed it because I work here. Lady, you and I have nothing to do with each other. -Okay? -You must want to hear why. Actually, I don't. Put yourself in my shoes. I was 16 years old, I was a kid. You know how life is. I thought about you every day, really. I've always regretted putting you up for adoption, but... Have you done well for yourself? When did you find out you were adopted? Are your adoptive parents nice people? -They died in an accident. -Oh, dear. Did you go to university? Yeah, I have two degrees. Wow, two degrees. -And a Master's. -And a Master's! That's something, for example, I don't know if I could have given you. Hey, please... Fidel! Listen! I know, and I understand, really I do. This is hard for me, too. We need to talk about it. I'm sorry, but I have something very important to do. We can't leave things like this. This is how they've always been. Then why did you want to meet me? Because my therapist has been bugging me about it for months. He says I need to face rejection. I didn't reject you! You didn't? Fidel! Fidel, are you okay? Please, call an ambulance! He jumped right in front of me! Oh, my God! What have you done? Are you okay? Fidel! Fidel! Are you okay? Call an ambulance! Fidel! Are you okay? No ice, with a lemon wedge. What? What's he saying? -Don't move. -No, I'm okay. -Are you? -Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm much better. I'm much, much... Call an ambulance! Fidel! Fidel, Fidel, Fidel. Fidel! Oh, my God! He's not breathing! Fidel. Good morning. -The kid is awake. -Great. Hi! How are you? Fidel, sweetie, how do you feel? Did you sleep okay? Let me see. Do you feel tired? Any pain? Look, I'm your nurse. And your mom and I go to dance class together. And my name is Belén. -Okay? -What's your name? Belén. No. Look, I'm Belén. Your name is Fidel. Fidel what? I don't know. Uh-oh. It's okay. It's okay. Listen. Listen to me. Do you remember getting hit by a bus yesterday? -I have water. Very water. -Thirsty? -Wait. -Drink some water. -I have water. -Here. -There. -That's it. Very good. Wow, he was thirsty! Is that better? Orinoco. -Orinoco? -Yes. Orinoco where? -In my country, Venezuela. -Orinoco. He wants to urinate. I don't know what's wrong with me. -It's okay, relax. -Yeah. I talk hard. -He's getting scared. Call the doctor. -It's okay, Fidel. Lie down. That's it. That's it, good. There. Just relax. What? Yabadaba. -See this dark area? -Yes. The impact caused a concussion in the neuron mass of his brain. Is that serious? He'll be okay, right? Don't worry. We just have to wait for his functions to go back to normal. How long does that take? Normally a few days. What about his memory? A typical case of transient global amnesia. It will come back to him in flashes. Take him home. Let him recognize his clothes, show him photos, tell him things. What things? From his childhood. Happy moments from his life. Moments from his life, right. You're his mother. You know everything about him, right? Did he have anything when the bus hit him? His wallet, -cell phone... -A backpack. -A backpack. -But it's gone. We don't know where it is. It might be at the hotel. I asked and nobody knows anything. The world is full of bastards. Bastard! But you have his number on your cell phone, right? -Sure. -We have his cell phone number. But I've called a thousand times and nobody answers. But nobody's answering. -Watch where you're going, asshole! -Keep it down. -What? -Yeah, bye. Cati says she'll check Missing Persons and to send her the number. If she finds anything, she'll call us. -Great. -What about you, kid? Are you getting any of this? We're the Mommies, your mother's friends. We go to dance class together. Do you like music? You're gonna flip. Gentlemen, we're here. Okay, get out. See you at class. -Thanks, Uge. See you soon. -No problem. Sure you don't want me to come up? I'm sure. I'll just get him settled in. -Okay. -Bye. -Call me if you need anything. -Okay. Let's go. It's this way. Look, the sooner you know, the better. Your name is Fidel. You're 35 years old and you're adopted. I'm your biological mother, but you don't remember anything because you have transient amnesia. From now on, we'll play it by ear. Lady, wait. -You're my mother? -Yes. I'm your mother, but I don't know you. I got pregnant when I was 16. I had no money, no job, and I gave you away. I never heard from you again until you called and said you wanted to meet me. Why? I don't know. I guess everybody wants to know where they came from. And I'm from... here? Yes. -I don't like it. -Too bad. It smells strong. Come in. Come in, come in. Go ahead. -How ugly. -Okay. Jump, dance, move your body. We want you to surprise us. Boys, this is your brother, Fidel. That's Maikel and that's Elton. THE TALENT SHOW What's up, man? You're the one who jumped in front of a bus? Really! -Why did you turn it off? -Because that's enough. -This place is a pigsty. -There was a meeting this morning. And we had to go to the unemployment office. You're not even going to give him a hug? Go on! No, I don't want one. What's wrong with him? Oops, I have fart. What's he saying? Dude, he's shitting himself. Not here. The bathroom is in there. Ass, ass, ass, ass... -Is he retarded? -No. But he doesn't remember anything. Right now, he's like a little boy. Will he be staying long? A couple of days, until his family comes for him. I'm going to class. Prepare the sofa for him to sleep on. -And give him clothes. -Our clothes? Yes. And towels. And take care of him until I get back. Please. We're going Pokémon hunting. You can go later. We need groceries. The fridge is empty. We're out of nachos, chicken nuggets and cup noodles. Fine, but take him along. You can't leave him alone. And I want change back. Fidel, sweetie. See you later. You're staying here with your brothers. Bye. It won't... It won't go away. It won't go away. It's doing this. It won't go... away. Oh, he means... Don't. Cross. Cross. Open. Work it. Open. Good. Up, up, side, side. Okay, one more time. Six, seven. -Eli. -I know, the fucking step. You're coming in late. You miss it and come in late. It's easy, let's try again. You're blocked. Relax, look. Maribel, excuse me. Can I step out for a second? -One second. -Thanks, sweetie. -Follow me, okay? -Okay. Lift your knee. -Well? -We did a raid on street vendors. -What's up? -I have information about your kid. Did you find his family? No, but I have a phone number. I'll give it to you after. I'm going to change. I traced his cell phone number and got his full name. Fidel García Ruiz. There must be thousands. Yeah, but I have his ID number and home phone. Let's see. Here. Are you calling? Put it on speaker phone. -Yeah? -Sure. -This thing... -Here. Mrs. Senillosa's residence. -"Residence." Sounds like money. -Quiet! Hello. May I please speak to the lady of the house? On whose behalf? Fidel's. One moment, please. Mrs. Senillosa must be his wife. I don't know. Fidel? Stop it, you hear me? I told you I never want to talk to you again. You're dead to me, you don't exist. I hate you, you disgust me. You have a restraining order. Contact me again and I'll call the police. What the... Does he ring a bell? No? They don't look familiar? No. You must recognize her. She's a famous singer. No. What about him? From around here? No, he's not from around here. Hi! I'm home! -Well? -It's no use, Mom. He's bonkers. His hard disc has been deleted. He barely talks, only gibberish. Has he had dinner? We got him a chocolate donut at the market. Damn! -Well, sweetie, was it good? -Disgusting. -You haven't made his bed. -Let him do it. Before I forget, where's my change for €50? -Bye, Mom. -Hey! It's okay, we'll be home early. -You should fire them. -What? They're rude, ignorant and constantly touching their getinals. Fire their asses. Here, give me a hand. Let's make your bed. Here. Grab that end. -This is horrible. -What is? Not knowing who I am. It's okay, don't get overwhelmed. Don't get overwhelmed. I don't know what "overwhelmed" means. Tomorrow, you might wake up and remember everything. -Yeah, that would be nice. -Sure. There must be somebody looking for me, right? Of course, son. Here, come on. Pull it tight. That's it. Good lord. Let's see. Fidel... García Ruiz. Images... Here he is. "STICKYMAN'S" FAMILY DISGRACED OMNICRON HR DIRECTOR FIRED ON THE SPOT What is this? Damn! Damn! That's my son. What do I do with you now? Hi, Mom. We'll be home early, huh? It's 7:00 in the morning. What will you do when unemployment runs out? We'll find work, Mom. Don't worry. -First, you have to look. -Stop nagging us all the time. Show your brother how the water heater works and make him breakfast. He'd better not go hungry. -Did you hear me? -Yes. Mom, Mom. One thing. He snuck into my bedroom. He didn't sneak in. I put him there, and he stays. -Who gave him permission? -The jackass who pays all the bills! What do we do, sleep together? Figure it out! It's a pull-out bed. I'll show him... Wake up, Sleeping Beauty. -Out of my bed! -What's happening? -Time for a walk, buddy. -What the... Wait, wait. -I have orinoco! -I think he wants to pee. Peeing outside is the best. Did the lady say I should go outside? Sure, to see the neighborhood. -What about a shower? -Another day. Wait... -What about my clothes? -What about them? -That's a classy look. -That's right. But I have no... toes. He's getting you some toes. There you go, a nice pair of toes. Go fetch. Bye. Hey, you! The ball! The ball. Do you know where... -the lady went? -What lady? She's this tall. And, like... Do you dance at the Tribe? I don't know. I have gymnasia. Transient gymnasia. What the... I think he's from the Tribe. -He must be looking for it. -It's that way. That way? Yeah, that way. Okay, thanks. Hey, the ball. The ball. Thanks. URBAN TRIBE DANCE SCHOOL Hi, what do you want? Me? Nothing. Where did you get that T-shirt? The lady gave it to me. You're not here to sign up? I don't know what "sign up" means. Most guys are too shy, but it'll be fine, you'll see. -Let me help you. -Oh, okay. Thanks. Leave it-- Do you know me? No, I don't. Me neither. What? I don't know who I am either. You're high, right? No. I wish. I have water. -I have water. -You want water. Yes, yes. -I'd love that. -I'll get you some. Look. Wait, I know them. -The Mommies? -Yes. This one with the crazy face, that's the lady. -Virginia? -Virginia the lady. Yes, the lady Virginia. Look, you have to loosen up. Like this. Which foot goes first? Cross your right over your left. And... -Yeah, but here... -No. When you get here, you open up and-- Hold on, I have a call. Mari? It's Maribel. What's up? Hi, Virgi. Do you have a sec? -Yeah, what's up? -Okay. There's a guy here who says he's your son, but I don't know him. Is his name Fidel? Is your name Fidel? You have a malicious virus. He's acting very strangely. Put him on. -Your mother. -May I? What are you doing? Firewall. -Is he a computer technician? -Look, I'll be right there. Just, please, make sure he doesn't escape. Please, it's very important. -What's wrong? -What's wrong? Those two are in deep shit, that's what! Bye, Maria. Hey, the guy who got hit by the bus the other day, -is it true he can't remember anything? -Why? You might not know this, but he's a real son of a bitch. Well, he's my son. Your son? Well, he's got people looking for him. And they're hot. You're confusing him with someone else. He signed 300 layoffs like he was giving away autographs. He didn't do anything. He'd better watch out. The people he fired want to lynch him. You're the one who should watch out. I've caught you more than once raiding the mini-bar. Sorry, sorry. -Where are you going? -My son. It's always the kids. Have you got kids? I have three and I'm all alone. -That's not the hotel's fault. -It's nobody's fault, it's just life. I'm serious, this is the last time. I promise, I have everything under control. Virginia. If you're looking for the weirdo, he's down there. Maribel said you were coming for him. He asked me for a Coca-Cola. I didn't give it to him because I thought he might be on medication. -Thanks. -You're welcome. You like it? The curly brunette. Very much. And the dance? Combinations of four and eight. It's mathematical, yeah. Why did you leave the apartment? The midget and fat guy kicked me out. Your brothers? Yeah, and I don't want to go back there. It's ugly, and dark and smells like feet. It's the only one we've got. Buy another one. Sure, I'll buy two. Come on, let's go. -You still don't know who I am? -No. Look, Fidel, I can't take care of you. I have to work. You have to understand. I can't be with you all day. But I can't leave you alone either. -No, you can't. -No, no, no. We'll have to find a solution. Wait here. Hi. Virginia, how are you? You see that kid over there? Who is he? We had a baby, remember? A baby you gave away without my permission. I didn't need your permission. I was the father. You were the sperm. And you were a year younger than me. That's him? -But I haven't told him about you. -Why not? Because it doesn't matter. He got hit by a bus, and he's like... -Well, he's lost his memory. -Oh, damn. It's better to only give him information a little at a time -until he recovers. -Yeah. He looks a bit like me, don't you think? He's nothing like you. But you're going to take care of him. Me? How? By giving him a job. -I can't pay him. -Just a tip or something. He won't remember anyway. -What can he do? -A lot of things. But he can't remember. -Fidel. -He can talk? Of course he can talk. Hello, sir. Hello, kid. My name is Luciano. -Does he stutter? -Talk to him normally. -Do you like it here? -Yes, but it's a mess. -A mess? -Everything is wrong. -What's wrong? -Everything. Shelves on three levels is better. Eyes, hands and feet. More expensive items at eye level so people buy more. Necessary items down below because people don't mind bending over. And items on sale at hand level. I want a freeze pop. Freeze pop. You look great in this one. Very modern. Yeah, but I'll pay you back. Sure, you'll be making a little money now. -You two! -We can't right now. We have a fired worker meeting, Mom. -You kicked him out. -You kicked me out of my room. Sleeping together like when we were kids. I asked you for one favor. Only one. You come home with some wacko who turns out to be your son... -Who we didn't even know about. -You make us babysit. -And give him our clothes. -And the best room. Is that normal? Is it normal to exploit your mother? -We exploit you? -Yes! You won't lift a finger to find work. -Not true, we signed up on InfoJobs. -Yes. But our profile is unmarketable. -Profile? What profile? -You have no profile! Shut up, fool. The lady is not your slave. She deserves respect. -You don't work either. -Yes, he does. -He starts Monday. -Selling freeze pops! You weren't like this before, Mom. What is this idiot doing to you? Don't be sad, lady. They're garbage. You're coming with me to dance class later. -No. -Yes. No, I don't want to dance. You're coming with me. It's just what you need. -Oh, yeah? How do you know? -Yes. How do I know? Oh, son, I was depressed and dancing cured me. Uge, the taxi driver, slit her wrists and almost died, and dancing saved her. Eli, my coworker, lived in constant fear of her husband, and dancing gave her the nerve to call the police. But I didn't slit my husband and I don't have wrists. -You wanted to kill yourself, Fidel. -When? When you knew who you were. But dancing cures everything, you'll see. Will the curly brunette be there? Yes. Okay, then. -Hi! -Hi! Hi! Finally, a man in the class! It's about time! And what a man! Lord have mercy! How are you feeling, Fidel? He looks just fine to me. Better than fine. You'll have a great time, you'll see. Just do what we do. Except Eli. She does her own thing. I have six toes. That holds me back. Just keep your eyes on me. No, stay as far away as you can from this one. What matters most is consistency. Be consistent no matter what. And most of all, never give up. Good, Eli. -Girls, let's get started. -Hi. Wow, a new student. Welcome. -Have you practiced? -Yes. -And stretched? -Of course. Okay, then. Let's take it from the end of the last time. One time through. Five, six, seven. Slowly. Open, close. Open and stop, three steps back. Eli. Eli, look. Remember, it's okay. Let's do it again. Look, when you crossed over... Cross over... -Girls, I'm explaining. -Sorry. Let's focus. Forget about him. Let's see a little pride. Pride! -Who are we? -The Mommies! What are we? Super hot! What will we do? Conquer the world! Okay, let's go! Music! Five, six, seven, go! Double! Open! One, two, double. One, two, double. Good! Let's go, and walk! And stop! Five, six! Hey... Very good, Fidel. Did you guys see? -Yes! -That was great! Show us again. The last part. Okay, with me. Seven... Open, close. Open and move. Did you guys see how good he is? What a bastard. You've danced before. I don't know. Your steps are right on. You were great, Fidel. Did you all bring your wardrobe? We're going straight to the disco. -Eli, let's go over that step again. -Okay, great. Bye, girls. Give 'em hell. Fidel, maybe you were a dancer before. -Or a homo. -Why a homo? Because they're great dancers. Or he's got rhythm in his blood, like me. Like black men. Where are you going? Yours is over there. Go on. Sorry, I thought nobody was here. -Normally, it's empty this late. -What is this? -What? -Look, look! Damn, cover yourself, you pig! What's wrong with me? You have an erection. Is that bad? No, it's not bad. It's normal. -Why does it do that? -Well... Because men... Never mind. It means you like women. Not women, you. Well, thanks. I guess. So, what happens now? Nothing. I leave, you get dressed and that's that. But this thing stays like this? It'll go back to normal. -I don't mind if it stays like this. -Not very comfortable for dancing. REINSTATE FIRED OMNICRON WORKERS Let's go. Why are they wearing those T-shirts? Because they got fired from their jobs. Like your brothers. Why? Well, you'll have to ask the person who fired them. Where is he? Hey. My husband says your son looks familiar. Yeah. Did you work on the packaging floor? No, he's not from around here. You see? That's what I said. He doesn't look familiar to you? No, you're confusing him with someone else. Maribel, come on, already! Let's go, son. Hey, you, wait. Solidarity. It's very... ugly, isn't it? Fidel, what are you doing here? -Come on, we saved you a spot. -What? Come and sit with us. -Here he comes. -Sit right there. What's up? -Hi. -Hi. Hey, where's your T-shirt? The T-shirt I gave you. Oh, the lady has it. -Apparently, she's my mother. -And what a mother. She's wonderful. And always in a good mood. Remember the thing with the gas? Her mom left the gas on and the place caught fire. But that didn't hold her back. And her breast cancer operation. Or when your brother got caught selling hash. -The same. -Selling hash! -She's strong. -Great story. Hello! Good evening, everyone, and thank you all for coming and contributing to the cause. I'd like to introduce the hippest Mommies in the whole world: Mari Ascen, Carol, Malole, Cristina, Mónica, Belén, Eli, Cati, Uge and Virginia! Gorgeous! They have a message for everyone. Hi, everyone. Well, there are ten of us. Life has been very hard on us, but we never give up because you have to keep fighting in life. Just like all of you have to. So, we're going to prove it to you. This is for you. Gorgeous! -Beautiful! -Beautiful, Mom! Well, how was your weekend? -Good. The lady made paella. -Great. It was disgusting. And we went to the movies and saw a film about men who can fly. Superheroes. Yeah, I don't know. It was all a lie. This is too small for me. -Mine, too. -What? No, mine too. Our backs are too wide. Yeah. I've always wanted a son. -Do you get what I'm saying? -Right. -How much are you going to pay me? -Five hundred euros. -A week? -No, a month. Oh, that sucks. -It's out of my pocket. -It still sucks. Anyway, when you're done, you can arrange these items on the shelf. Arranged well or arranged badly like they are now? However you want, son. You don't mind me calling you son, do you? If you call me son, pay me double. What a money freak. Don't give me that, I've had a shitty day. I saw an albino ventriloquist, a group of midget mariachis. Here you go. Listen, a guy who plays the national anthem with his armpits. Can you use that? Can you use that? Hold on, I've got a call. Just wait, please. Who is it now? Hi, Juanfran, darling. What's up? Don't worry, I'll send you today's latest freak show. I have to go. I'm going to be late to Asier's premiere. Okay, tomorrow's another day. Yeah, big kiss. Bye. Bingo. Listen, it wasn't a joke. I'm watching them right now. Who? The hip-hop housewives. Yeah, right in front of me. What an atrocity! The biggest thing since Gorillas in the Mist. I'm hanging up before I kill myself. Okay, big kiss. Bye. I'm sorry, you can't record in here. The hip-hop housewife class? There are no housewives here, only students. -I said you can't record in here. -Sure I can. I'm from TV. -TV? What TV? -The talent contest. -Nobody said anything. -My show is hot, hot, hot. You haven't seen the commercials? What planet do you live on? You're going to have to leave. Look, there they are! Look at the fat one move her ass! She looks like a blowfish! Shut up or I'll kick your ass. That's my mother. -Okay. -It's right, left, turn, stop, together. Here we go, finish. Eight, nine... Girls, this is a disaster. It's too hard. Okay. Girls, one second. Keep practicing. -Let's see. -It's too many steps. You're not getting it because you're skipping one. Seriously. From here, it's 16 steps and you're doing 15. Because after the four, the fifth has a double time. Where did you get that? Someone sent it to us. -It's them, right? -Yeah. It's one, two, three, four. And five, and six, and seven, and eight, nine, ten. Eleven, and twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen. Great! Very nice! -Is that a teacher? -No, he just started. He looks familiar. -Mathematics! -Hey! I know who you are. -Yeah? Who? -How could I be so blind? -Look who it is. -Who? Badalona's Billy Elliot. Okay, girls, please, we can't be outdone -by one damn step. -Right. -Let's see a little pride! -Pride! -Who are we? -The Mommies! -What are we? -Super hot! -What will we do? -Conquer the world! They're wonderful. We'll do the video next week. -What do you mean, next week? -To show my bosses. They'll love it. I have a younger group getting ready for the championship. -They're great, you'll love them. -Listen to me. People are good everywhere. We're looking for stories with heart. Like this. One week? Impossible. It isn't enough time. That's what I said, but it's up to all of you. We haven't got it down and that step kills me. -Exactly right. -Don't you want to be on TV? -Actually... -I do. I love showing off in front of everyone. -Hi! What's up? -Attagirl. The sexy taxi driver! It's good for Maribel, it's good for the business and it's good for your pride. But we have to nail it. That's your hole. -Goal, sweetie. -That's right. We need four things. One, effort. Two, dedication. Three, sacrifice. And four, I don't remember. But we have to work, work, work. And then there's the ugly thing. The what? What's the ugly thing? -All of you. -Us, ugly? Yeah. You are. Not you, but they are. They're ugly. They have to look beautiful. They're already beautiful. -Right, girls? -Sure. -On the inside. -What? Inside and out. Ugly? My snatch is a catch! Look, you want to see some beautiful ladies? You're going to shit in your pants. Girls, nobody get nervous. I want you all to be loose. And focused. Focused. And most of all, attitude. You have to sell it. -Lots of attitude. And count. -One moment, please. Is that a casual look or what? Yeah, why? No, because they all look so spectacular. -He's not performing. -No. They're the Mommies. Without him, it loses its flair. You're calling us dull? What's original is the combination. I'll record it, but they may not want it. There are 40 out there just like you ladies. If I have to dance, I'll dance. No, Fidel, you're not in the group. But maybe, it's good if he's on TV. Someone might recognize him and we'll finally know who he is. Very good idea. -But-- -Virginia, Cati's right. -After all, she's a police officer. -Sure, much better. -No, I just don't see it. -You don't mind? -No, let's do it. -Okay. -Ready? -Yeah. Okay, places everyone! Tighten it up back there. Come on. Hold on. Kid. -Stand in the center. -In the middle? Yes, please. Thank you. Here. What are you doing, lady? I was... Music. -Is this some kind of a joke? -A joke? Who is that? Someone famous? 23,200,000 clicks on the Internet. You don't believe me? -Stickyman! -Bingo! I saw him and thought, "I know him, but from where?" He looks different, but that look in his eye is still there. Look, Sofia. This guy was missing in action. People are going to flip. Chacho! Monumental. I'm in no mood for compliments. You never are for me. I just don't know what to do with him. Fidel? If you were Judas' father and Judas didn't know he's Judas, would you tell him he's Judas? Judas who? The one from the Gospel, the kiss, the one who betrayed Jesus for 30 silver coins. You're comparing my son to that bastard? He was head of Human Resources at Omnicron. The one who fired 20% of the staff in one shot. -The executioner? -Yes. And if he goes on TV, half of Badalona will see him. They'll recognize him. Although they won't take us because we danced like shit, especially me. Oh, you're here. I'll get changed and we'll go. Fidel. Fidel. Fidel. Take those off. Take off your headphones. It's just... Before we go in, I want... I want you to know something. I should have told you before, but I wanted to protect you and I kept quiet. -Are you going to cry? -No. I don't know. I don't want you to cry, Mom. What did you say? -I don't want you to cry. -No, the other part. -Mom. -Virgi, hurry up! -Virgi, hurry up! -What's going on? We made the cut, Virginia. -Yeah, Maribel just told us. -We're going on TV in eight days. Look. -Good lord! -That's great! -We're going on TV! -Me, too? Yeah, they want all of us! You too! How could they not want him with that tight ass of his? Virginia, aren't you happy? Well... I am, Mom! I'm totally psyched! He calls me Mom now. What do you expect him to call you? Bitch? Champagne. What enthusiasm. The bad news is we have to do a new choreography. -Another one? -Why? They want something more modern. Impossible. We can't do a new one. -Why is it impossible? -There isn't time. Okay, we just have to rehearse a lot. More than a lot. We all work. Where will we find the time? Anywhere we can. Early morning, at night, on Sunday. -And the housework? -Right. Let the husbands and kids do it. Yeah. What if they say no? Then fire them. Goodbye. Are we going to give up? You don't want an experience like this? Maribel, do you think we can pull this off? Sure. If we work hard, sure we can. -Sure we can! Pride! -Pride! -Who are we? -The Mommies! -What are we? -Super hot! -Let's go, my snatch is a catch! -Right on! Brothers, the potty's over. Party, Fidel. From now on you clean, cook and wash your clothes. -Why is that? -Because the mom has to rehearse. And so do I. We're going to be on TV. -You're going on TV? -On The Talent Show! I told you, man. What? We made the video at the disco and sent it in. Who gave you permission to send anything anywhere? -We're proud of our mother. -She's the Spanish cat's meow. The Spanish cat's meow is sick of you two. What is this freak talking about? Pride. Well, that I'm sick of how lazy you are, eating like pigs all day long. A whole year out of work, sitting around scratching your balls! I'm not giving you another euro until you get your act together. Mom! -You're microbes! -Parasites, son. Fire them, let them fend for themselves. You deserve better. I deserve better. How long have I worked at this hotel? Fifteen years? Isn't it time to give me a promotion? That supervisor position is opening up soon because Reme's retiring. And you know I deserve it. And don't give me that look. You know I'm right. And since I'm right, you'll think about it and realize that what I'm saying is the way it should be by law. Okay, I said it. It wasn't easy, but I said it. I can't give you that job, Virginia. Of course you can! I'm worthy of being a supervisor and you know it. I want that job and you're going to give it to me. Oh, and another thing. The next few days, she and I can only work half days, and no weekends because we have to rehearse. We're going to perform on television. Virginia, you give me a hard-on. Where's Luciano? What a drag. I think I'm going to stay. No, the two of us want to talk to you about something. -Am I getting a raise? -No. Then we'll talk another day. I'm going to shower up here. We have to load all the wardrobe on the bus. I can't leave Maribel alone. -Of course, son. -See you later. Damn you, Luciano. You always do this to me. Oh, sorry! No, I'm sorry. I thought you'd left. Yeah, I did, but I came back because I thought you might need help with... With? With... That thing is happening to me again. It doesn't happen to girls? Yeah, it does. Yeah? And how can you tell? Really? Son of a bitch! -I can't. -What? -I can't. -What? I can't. Something happened. Something happened when? -Before. -What happened? -I'm scared. -Scared of what? That I can't get out. -Out of what? -Of you, damn it! Of you! Of you. Damn. Damn it, damn it! Are you okay? It all suddenly came back to me. You got your memory back. Yeah. I know who I am now. It's okay, that's a good thing. No, it's not. It's not good at all, damn it. Dude! -What the... -Luciano. -Are you okay? -Yeah, get me out of here. What's wrong? Please, get me out of here. Tell me what's wrong. Please, just take me home. -To your mother's? -No, Barcelona. The high part. That's where I live. You got your memory back. Yeah, it's all here. It was like opening a faucet. Congratulations. That's great, right? No. I'm a monster, Luciano. A monster. -No, you're not. -Yes. I was a bastard. Everyone will hate me now. Your mother won't hate you, and neither will I. I've hurt a lot of people. The girls' husbands, my brothers-- That's enough, Fidel. It's okay. What do you mean, it's okay? I'm not Fidel. I'm fucking Stickyman! Fuck! There's something-- Please, I don't feel like talking. Leave me alone. You're not my father. I'll get out here. -No, I'll take you home. -Look. I'll probably never see you again, so thanks a lot for everything, boss. -Go ahead. -No, you. I never thought working in a supermarket could be so... fun, really. Careful they don't get wrinkled. Look, there's Virginia. -It's about time. -You're such a pain. These two... Hey, and where's Fidel? -Where's Fidel? -He's here, right? -No, he left. -He left? Where? Weren't you with him? Well, the thing is, he got his memory back. No. Isn't that good? -Why are you being so negative? -Yeah, why? Because when he knew who he was, he wanted to kill himself. -That might be him. -Answer it! It's Luciano. Luciano, I can't talk to you right now. What? I'm following him, wait. He stopped outside a building, he's about to go in. Okay, I'm going to park. There are some movers bringing out furniture. Yeah, he went inside. He's inside. 150, Santalo Street. 150, Santalo Street. I don't know which apartment. -2A, there you go. -Thanks, Mariano. -How's the Master's degree? -What? Your cousin said you were in Chicago doing a Master's. My cousin? Yeah. He said you were letting him stay to water the plants. I've never seen any plants, but since he had his own keys... Damn. Who are you? What are you doing here? You scared me, buddy. I'm not your buddy. And I'm calling the police. -Oh, yeah? -Yeah. Your cell phone's in there. Go ahead. -Call. -You stole my backpack? -You stole my job. -What? You're one of the 300. Jesus Christ. I served you coffee every morning, remember? With stevia and a dab of cream. You're the waiter who poured water on my head. Damn it, damn it. Damn it! Can I make you some coffee? -Or tea? -No. Have you eaten? -I'll heat one up for you. -Don't touch me. Don't touch me. Is that my underwear? Yeah. So is the shirt. Okay, I'll get my stuff and leave. Just so you know, I don't regret a thing. Can you drive a little faster, please? No, no, no! On the right! On the right! On the right! Shit. Stop where you see that gentleman over there. That man in the striped shirt. That's it, right here. -Is this it? -That building. Good lord, I hope we're not too late. No, please. Let me, I'm his mother. And I'm his father. Let's go. Where the hell is it? What are you looking for? Can I help? They were in here. -Looking for this? -Yes. My antidepressants. There's only one left! I've been going through a rough time, too. I got fired, had to find a new job, -take my family to the village-- -Okay, already! I got the picture! Well, excuse me. I'm leaving. I'm sorry. Wait, wait! What are you doing here? -Nothing, I was just leaving. -Where's my son? Inside. Fidel? No! Oh, no! He took them all! What have you done? Spit them out! Spit them out! Put your fingers down his throat! Make him vomit! There's only one. Why did you do that? Because I'm your mother. And I'm your father. What? Did he say "father"? Yes, he did. Your father. -Really? -Really. What are you doing here? Stopping you from doing something stupid. But... Look, forget about me. Please. Forget about you? I already did for too long. I can't anymore. He's really my father? Yes, he is. You have no idea. -I'm the one who fired the 300 workers. -I know. -Your sons. -I know. -I've been hiding for a year. -I know everything, Fidel. Since when? Since the beginning. Why didn't you say anything? I thought it would put you over the edge. You thought? You shouldn't have thought for me. What do you mean? I saw you jump in front of a bus! That gives you no right! -Don't talk to me about rights. -Why? Say it. Because I'm a bastard, right? No, you're not. They made you do what you did. I'm sure of it. You're wrong. I'm the one who decided how many to fire. -Because I loved firing people. -No! You think you did because they made you believe that. How do you know? How do I know? Because I know. When you were born, I didn't even take you in my arms. I closed my eyes and laid you off. Just like you laid off all those people. You see, we're not so different. Excuse me. We need to go. We're late. Yeah. Let's go. -He's really my... -Yes, he is, what can I do? -Let's go. -No, I'm not going. -What do you mean? -I'm not going. If you don't go, the Mommies won't dance. You can't ask me to exhibit myself publicly on TV. That's exactly what you need. It took me a while to realize, but that's it. What? To stop hiding, Fidel. Accept who you are. Everyone will laugh at me. I'm Stickyman. Who cares? Let them laugh. You'll have to live with that. I can't. Look. Look at all those women down there. Look how excited they are. You know why? They're here because of you. Because of you. You can't leave them hanging now, Fidel. Pride! Pride, Fidel. Pride! Pride, son! Pride. Good evening, good evening, good evening! Welcome to The Talent Show! I talked to her half an hour ago. They're on their way! Stop bullshitting me, Chacho. We can move up the tap dancers. I don't care what you do, just do it now. Move it! Everybody inside, quickly! We're late! Let's go, let's go! -I'm going to kill you bitches! -Sorry. -I almost had a heart attack. -And we almost had two. -It's a miracle we made it. -I was about to change the schedule! -Where is he? The guy who dances with you. -Look, here he comes. Okay. Are you ready? Yeah, we changed on the bus. Follow me, you're up next. -Next? -Yeah, after the cheerleaders. -Wait! -Come on, hurry up! Come on, the taller ones in the back. Everybody up there, please. Wait, don't let the camera see you yet. -Who are you? -His father. -Yeah. -Yeah, he's his father. Isn't he going on? Yes, but they're going to interview the girls first. -Okay. -Perfect, right there. -Here? -There. Girls, give it your all. I'll be watching in the booth. Go on, take them away. Who's going on? They know what to do, go on. -Chacho, I'm all alone. -Positive attitude! Girls, here we go! Let's do it! Yes? Okay. Ladies, get ready. Manel is on his way. Oh, God, Manel... Stay calm. Stay calm, don't get nervous. Good luck. -Are you feeling better? -Yeah. Let's go. You can't come. -Stay there. -I'm his father. I don't care. Congratulations to the cheerleading squad! Thanks, kids. A great performance, but as you know, you decide at home and the verdict is in your hands. From Navalcarnero, we move on to Badalona. We're talking about mommies, the best thing in life. But the mommies here with us tonight are no ordinary mommies. They've come to give us all an example of courage... This show sucks. We have to wait here for orders from upstairs. I'd make a run for it. Yeah, me too, but I can't. Maribel, here he comes. Here he comes! ...even adversity or problems in life. Nothing can come between them and their dream. Here they are. Very nervous, I imagine. Yes, we are. And now, even more so. Ten women from Badalona. They are: Mari Ascen, Belén, Carol, Cati, Cris, Eli, Malole, Mónica, Uge and Virginia. Let's give them a big applause. Gorgeous! These women are a symbol of courage and overcoming obstacles. They're here to say that you can dance at any age, right, girls? Any age, he says. Ask my kidneys. Why do you call yourselves the Mommies? We were taking our kids to dance class and we'd wait outside for them, until one day we said, "Why are we waiting outside instead of dancing, too?" But you don't dance to just anything. -No, we do urban dance. -Urban dance. But these wonderful women are not alone. There's a young man with them, Fidel, who I'm told is one of your sons. Yes, he's my son. But what really matters here is the group. Of course, what matters is the group, but also its leader. We'll talk about it all after this commercial break. After the break, Manel comes in, introduces a 45-second video and then you go on. All right? -By myself? -Yeah, that's what they told me. We're back at The Talent Show. You've met the Mommies, and these wonderful women have come with a man who was an Internet sensation only one year ago. Many of you probably remember him. Over the course of human history, there have been many cases of anthropomorphism. The Elephant Man, Spiderman, the Wolf Man and the Abominable Snowman. They have all filled pages and pages of the history of scientific literature. But none of them caused such a stir last year as the incredible Stickyman. His romantic attachment to an intern took social networks by storm. The song written in his honor was a global hit. And his incredibly unique case had all the doctors talking. -Who is that? -The Human Resources bastard! But suddenly, he vanished. He disappeared. Tonight, he reappears exclusively on our program. Everyone welcome Fidel García Ruiz, Stickyman! Good evening, Fidel. Welcome. -Good evening. -What a surprise! Yeah, actually it was a surprise for me as well. You went missing for a whole year! Well, yeah, I had to hide because I was ashamed of people knowing me because of this. And with the whole mess it caused, you can imagine. But anyway, I'm through hiding. I'm here, and I've come tonight to show my face. Even if I get punched out. Tell Manel to keep going. It's okay. Okay, Fidel. And why did you decide to do it tonight? -Well, I'm here to dance. -Yes. I might make a fool of myself again, but at least it's for a good cause. Tell me, if you could go back, even only once in your life, would you erase that chapter completely? The part I would erase is having fired those 300 people. That's what I would erase. And the other thing? -That could happen to anybody. -Well, anybody... Yeah, anybody. Well, anybody... -Can I say something, Manel? -Of course. Look, these women have changed my life. And not only because they made me dance, but because they made me realize that I... I've been a piece of shit my whole life. Yes, a piece of shit, Manel. A piece of shit capable of doing anything for money. It's disgusting, the things we do for money. But these ladies dance for the sheer pleasure of dancing. Because they like it, they're passionate about it. Not money, not fame, they dance because they don't give a... -Because they don't give a heck. -Yes. Not the other thing. And that's the biggest victory a person can have. Really. I wanted to be somebody and I was a nobody. And now I know who I want to be. I want to be and feel like just another mommy. I hope they feel the same way, and... that they accept me in the tribe. And now, without further delay, Fidel and the Mommies! There are only four! -There were ten! -Where are they? What the fuck is this? A talent show or a hippie grandma sit-in? -You want me to stop it? -Either way, you're fired! That's my son! My son. Yeah, he's got my eyes. I'm so proud of you, son. What a dancer! It's in my blood. We're going to have fun Don't you know it? Let's get sticky Go with it Here we go!
