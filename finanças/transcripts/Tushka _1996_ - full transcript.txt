- This morning at 4am, FBI, in association with Chicago Police, made a successful raid on the home of Black Panther Chairman Fred Hampton. As the FBI approached the apartment, they were met with an onslaught from the Panthers guarding the Hampton home. The first man standing guard in the living room here was Mark Clark. He fired on the FBI (guns firing) and was taken down immediately. As the FBI made their way in, a second Panther fired on the agents as well. He was shot and killed. Agent Harold Raines led the FBI through this main hallway to the bedroom, where Fred Hampton could be found. (gun firing) Hampton refused to cooperate and retaliated. Our agents did what they could, but Fred Hampton was shot and killed. Before I take any questions, I will state for the record that the FBI and Chicago Police showed remarkable restraint in halting another left-wing subversive. Hampton's body was officially found here at this doorstep by coroners and was pronounced dead at 5:02am. First question. (flute and drum music) (inaudible radio chatter) - [Man Over Radio] Agent Jack Raines, please be advised, Federal Bureau of Investigation report on recent Tushka activity in Oklahoma. Tushka chapter leader Marcus Beams last seen at a trailer park in the outskirts of Tahlequah. He is armed and accompanied by fellow Tushka radicals. Extreme caution is advised, over. (tribal chanting) - He's not here. - [Man Over Radio] Come again, Jack? - He's not here. (laughing) (speaking foreign language) (laughing) - You, shut up! (flute whistling) (guns firing) - [Man] Get the hell outta here! - I left something behind! - [Jack] How many? - It's just one. He's up ahead in that orange pickup. - That you, boy? (glass shattering) Relax. Just relax. Look, you don't wanna shoot anybody. - [Marcus] If I wanted to shoot somebody, you wouldn't be standing. - Exactly. We came to talk. - [Marcus] I'm listening. - Give me the gun first. - Get back! I'm getting nervous. - I got him, Tom. What do you say? (gun firing) - You took shots at us, boy. That's a federal offense. - So is murder. Any of you guys guilty of that? - (laughing) You still got a mouth on you, don't you, boy? - [Man] I think one of them got away. - Well, he only has one leg, so he couldn't have gotten too far. - Were you gonna shoot me, boy? - I hope he was worth it. He cost us eight Tushka subversives. I think that one's dead. (laughing) He came back for his friends. Some kinda hero? - Is that why you came back, boy? - Well done, sir. - That was brave. - Thanks. - Y'all just find that wounded Indian. - All comfy? - Yeah. - Yeah what? - I was gonna shoot you. - Well, they sure are impressed with you. (laughing) Just like Daddy. - Shut up. (tribal chanting) - You know the drill. Strip! - Billy. Can you tell me what this is? I know it's a medicine bag, but what's it for? (flute whistling) - It protects you. Things in this bag are those things that are closest to you. - Like what? Drugs? - No. Herbs. Holy objects. See, it's superstition. - [Jack] What do you have in yours? - I got rid of mine a long time ago. Besides, you're not supposed to tell. That takes away its power. See? Superstition. (grunting and straining) - [Douglas] It's a good thing he was shot. They sure are fast. - How fast would you run for your freedom, Douglas? Put him in back with Beams. (grunting and straining) (Southern rock music) - (laughing) That Indian was gonna kill you. - Yeah, I can't believe you just stood there. - Look, I'm not dead, all right? - (laughing) Just like Daddy. - You been sitting here all night. Wanna dance? - Yeah, make him have a good time. Can we have another round? - What'd you say to him? - Well, Harold Raines is his dad. - That's Harold's kid? I heard about him in training. - My god, who hasn't? How'd you like to have to live up to that? Come on, enough shop talk. Let's go get laid. Jack. Man, I'm sorry to hear about that rash. I mean, that's a tough thing to deal with, you know? (laughing) (tribal chanting) - [Jimmy] Go to sleep. They'll wanna question us in the morning. - I know. - Why did you come back? - I left something behind. - But you were free. They can't see you. - That's gonna change, Jimmy. (tribal chanting) (radio static humming) (flute whistling) - [Harold] Son, get up. I said get up! - Ow! - [Harold] You're gonna learn to be like me. - Ow! (car horn blaring) (flute whistling) (tribal chanting) Dammit! - [Woman] Marcus? - [Billy] Beams, wake up, boy! - Where's Jimmy? - They took him hours ago. - Philip's here and the ACLU from Kensler's office. - Marcus, you're gonna have to answer a few questions and I'll have you outta here in a few hours. - Mommy, Mommy! Where were you, Daddy? Mommy was worried. - She was? Were you worried about me? (imitating airplane engine) - Hi, Mama. - Is everything all right? - Yeah, Mama, why? - Mitchell Two-Hatchet was here, looking for Marcus. - [Tina] What'd he want? - He wouldn't say. He wants Marcus to come by after dinner. I don't like this, Tina. (imitating airplane engine) - [Tina] Mitchell was here. - I know. - He wants to talk to you after dinner. - What else did he say? - Nothing. What is going on here? (slow drum and flute music) (gun firing) (car horn honking) - Tina, I'm going now. - [Alex] How was it? - [Marcus] Real good. - You know, Mitchell was here. - [Marcus] I know, Alex, let's go. (tribal chanting) (speaking foreign language) - You been practicing your Choctaw. - Yeah, and the white man Choctaws cut off my hair last week. Yeah man, the goons came around last Wednesday with the feds. It's like a weekly thing with them now, man. They ain't never gonna let us rest. - Where's Mitchell? - In fact, we're about due for one. - Where's Two-Hatchet? - Huh? He's in the council house. Yeah, he said he wanted to see you guys. That can't be too good, the way things have been going. (tribal chanting) - Sit down, please. We all have to talk. The feds are hurting us more than ever now. - That's right, but we can't stop now. With the ACLU helping us, we'll be fine. - How long will that last? Those feds will murder us if they have to. - So, why give up now? If we don't stand a chance, why not keep fighting? - Because life is always better than death, Marcus. - This is not life! At least not the life of a Choctaw. - Remember, Marcus, the white man is not our friend. He isn't our enemy. He is a test. Do we want to live a white man or die a Choctaw? Now, Marcus, I've been wanting to see you. - I know, we have a problem. - What we have is not a problem. We passed problem about 500 years ago. (chuckling) This isn't the war anymore. It's about survival. There's no win or lose. We demand rights from him, now. - I am not at war. - What do you call this? - I'm surviving. - You young men have to understand, those FBis will kill you. - That doesn't matter. - That is selfish. You have families and they come first. Now, Marcus, we have other problems. - Raines has my medicine. - What would a white man do with a Choctaw's medicine? He will look at it with wonder, study it, or he can destroy it. (tribal chanting) (thunder rumbling) (light flute music) (tribal chanting) (horse hooves clopping) (water splashing) (thunder rumbling) (flames crackling) - [Amanda] Where are you wanting to go, Daddy? Mommy can protect us. Where are you wanting to go, Daddy? Mommy can protect us. (gun firing) (screaming) - What did you see, Marcus? - My family. - And where did you get that? - I don't know. - I predict the worst. But if you stay close to your family, they will be fine. - What's going to happen? - It's never good to assume the worst. But whenever it's this bad, I remember what my grandfather said on his deathbed. When the demons come for me, they are scared. They know that not all of them will return alive. Remember, Marcus, we have help on the inside as well. He knows your Choctaw name. Trust him when he tells you. (feet shuffling) - Drop 'em. (speaking foreign language) Drop 'em. (speaking foreign language) Turn around. Put your hands on your head. Here he is, Jack. - Didn't we just arrest you? All right, Marcus, this is it. Putting you back in and you're not getting out this time. - You stay away from my family, Jack. - Your family? - You heard me, Jack! - They don't have anything to do with this. - That's right, they don't! (gun firing) (dramatic percussion music) - He got away. - Ah, it's bound to happen. - Damn, Jack, I thought you were bullshitting when you brought us out here. - What's that? - How'd you know Beams would be here? - What the hell happened to my last cigarette? (flute whistling) - You're a good son. Someday, you'll be just like me. You'll see. You'll see. - [Jack] Dammit! - This time, they came a little earlier than 5:00 in the morning. - Damn ACLU. - And damn Kensler. - God, I can't believe this shit! - Washington isn't going to like this, Jack. - Sir, that won't be necessary. Well, I see, but it's not... I see, but it's not going to help. Who is it? Who? When? When? Yeah, right, no problem. 4:38 flight. No problem, yes sir. Yes sir. (glass shattering) (dramatic orchestral music) Williams. - Jack? There you go, now. Hear you're having quite a few problems out here. - No. - Well, I'm hear for a reason. Having problems with the hostiles, Jack? - Nothing that we can't handle. - Well, Washington feels you're doing a hell of a fine job out here, but the publicity'll kill us if we don't take care of it, Jack. - It's all well in hand, believe me. - Well, Washington calls the shots. I'm just the cleanup guy. - That's what I hear. - They can't keep on playing cowboys and Indians forever, Jack. You been out here long? - Eh, three years. - They've moved me around so much I'm already bored of this assignment. (laughing) This him? Marcus Beams? Looks like a problem. Family, huh? - Yep. - Wife and three kids. They're beautiful. - Where you coming from? - Chicago. - Chicago? Did you know Harold Raines? He was my old man. Worked in and outta there for 13, 14 years. - I knew him quite well, Jack. Hell of a field agent. He taught us all a thing or two. - Yeah, he was something else all right. - More than you'll even know, kid. Guess they wanted somebody close to the family to make you feel more comfortable. - Yeah, I guess so. - (laughing) That's funny he never mentioned a son. - This is their main trail. - [Paul] That's a trail? - Yep. Pretty sure they've got a secret one somewhere, we just haven't been able to find it yet. Our target's right up ahead. - Where? - Alex Littledove. Tom, go ahead and signal. Littledove has a house that he hides in about a mile up the trail. He knows where he is? - Will they give him up? - [Tom] Jack, we're ready over here. - What? - Will they give up Beams? Is this him? - [Tom] Yeah. - Will they give him up? - No doubt. Alex, I don't give a damn about that. You know, you could yourself a lotta grief by just telling us what we wanna know. What do you think we're here for today, Alex, a picnic? Now, I know you know where he is! - [Alex] I don't know and I don't care, man. - [Jack] You don't know? - [Alex] I don't know nothing. - [Jack] Well, you better find out and you better learn to care, because if we don't find out what we wanna know today, you gonna get hurt, Alex. - [Alex] I don't know nothing, man, leave me alone. - [Jack] You don't know nothing? You better find out, Alex, or you're gonna get hurt and you're gonna get hurt bad! Now, where he is?! - [Alex] I don't know! - You're like a damn broken record! Goddammit! - Hey, Jack, come on! - Anybody ever teach you how to interrogate a prisoner? - No. - Well, come on then. - [Jack] You get anything? - He cracked. - You did it? - No. - (sighing) Damn! - Jack, I don't know where this guy comes from. - They call it Robber's Cave. Do you know where that is? - [Jack] Yeah, I know where it is. - Littledove says they meet there at night. That'd give us a couple hours. - [Jack] Where's Douglas? - He's ill, but he'll be fine. You ready? - Yeah. Why don't you three take the other car? You ride with me. - You might wanna tell me who your inside man is. I wouldn't wanna shoot him. - What inside man? - You have no one on the inside? - No. - How do you operate? Where in the hell do you get your information? - I've been out here long enough to know their habits. - Well, in Chicago it's standard. - Well that may be. In case you haven't noticed, this isn't Chicago. - I know, it's a small town. It'll grow on you, boy. - Not good at all. - [Marcus] I know. - Let what happened to Leonard be a warning. This could happen to you if they try hard enough. What happened to Leonard is very sad, but it is a consequence he was aware of. - They're accusing him of murdering a federal agent. If they don't get the death penalty, it will be life. - Remember, Leonard knew this might happen, and all of you have to know the same. - They're transferring him to Washington, D.C. That's where they'll try him. - Then that's where we'll go. (dogs barking) (flute whistling) (guns firing) (tribal chanting) - You guys can't see shit. (grenade exploding) (dramatic percussion music) - [Jack] Paul! (crickets chirping) - Why in the hell wasn't we told about this? Get the goons and circle around to the other side. Get the goons and circle around to the other side! We ain't gonna find anybody. You know, it ain't gonna do a whole lotta good anyway. - You wouldn't know. - This ain't any good, Jack. These Indian boys shouldn't be such a problem. - What the hell are you talking about? - These Indians been dead for a long time now. There's only a couple million of 'em left in the entire world. That makes their membership possibilities real little. Look out there. This is 50% of their numbers right there, half of 'em so white they don't even care. In Chicago, we at least had to find a negro to infiltrate the Panthers. Here, they're standing in line to cooperate and they can even be white. - I've neutralized them. They've been quieted. - Take a look around, Jack. This is all they've got and it's nothing. Trees, bushes. - Look, the Panthers took your divisions years, so don't... - There are more black people in this world than there are white, Jack. The Panthers'd have their members one way or the other. And your dad, he understood that. Your dad understood how these subversives operate. - So, how did he do it? What? - Murder. He didn't take no shit, boy. (flute whistling) (suspenseful orchestral music) - Leonard is being sent to Washington as we speak. They're accusing him of killing those feds in Whitesboro. We all know he doesn't stand a chance. - We all know Leonard didn't do it, so it's up to us. He may never see his family again. - We are going to his trial. We are marching on Washington. - Like hell. Leonard Redstone's trial is the hot topic in Tushka right now. - They're going to get a good turnout, and not just because of the Indian element. There'll be a lotta left-wing whites there. - They can have enough people to fill an area from the White House to FBI Headquarters. That's home, fellas. - Right in front of them. We can't save Leonard, none of us can. I just want to let him know that it's still going on. The feds are gonna come down hard on us when they find out, so let's get hid and stay there. - Is this gonna help or are we asking for... - [Man] This puts us all in danger, Marcus, and it ain't gonna do any good! - You guys wanna stop 'em, we're gonna have to take 'em down. We're gonna have to get bloody. Did you hear what Jack said? They're gonna march on Washington. That means my ass and that's your ass. - We're talking about an embarrassment, our jobs, our reputations. Bottom line, they're not going to Washington. - [Paul] And if they do? - They're going to kill us, Marcus! And what good is another dead Indian? - That's right, they can kill us and it won't amount to anything. How long do you wanna go on like this? - But we've all got our families to think about, our kids and our elders. - Damn right, we do! If I can't raise my kids as Choctaws, I at least wanna raise them as human beings. And I'll be damned if I sit here and worry about myself. - No prisoners. - You want us to kill 'em? - If that's what... - You do not fire unless the situation deems that action or I say so. - How's our strategy change? - We need more information before they leave. Just bring 'em in, guys. We've gotta be way more aggressive with them from now on. We're not taking any more shit. - I want everybody to keep an eye out for Alex. Jimmy's in the hospital, but Alex hasn't turned up yet. And remember, we are all we've got. - Hey boy, remember, all I need is a name. Who's gonna care? They can't hurt you. All I need to know is who knows more than you do. It can get a hell of a lot worse, boy. Douglas, give me those cigars out of Jack's car. Mr. Littledove doesn't believe me. - [Douglas] You don't mean the Cubans. - Hell no, the cheap ones. Ain't no one smoking these cigars. They're strictly for burning. - No, wait. What, what? - [Paul] I think you know what. - Samson. - What was that? - Samson. (sobbing) (Southern rock music) - [Marcus] You know, Ms. Beams? - [Tina] Do I know what? - You're so beautiful. I just have to remember what you look like. - [Tina] Where are you going? - I'm going to Washington. - Marcus. - [Marcus] You know I can't let 'em... - Kensler can take care of Leonard. - This is what has to be done. - What is going on? - Nothing, nothing. - Dammit, Marcus, we can't keep doing this now. - What is going on? - [Tina] He's going to Washington. - [Marcus] Tina, somebody has to. - Marcus, you are just asking for trouble. (screaming) - [Goon] Look, all we want... - [Principal] I told you, I don't know! I'm just the principal! - Yeah, yeah, yeah, just the principal. What the hell's this?! Read that. - Tushka (speaking foreign language), red warrior. - See, we don't believe it. - This is not Tushka, this is a school! - [Man] Why was the principal out of his office. - [Man] Probably checking on the kids, or his kids. - We're not buying that. - All right, guys, I got him. Go ahead and step outside for a second. Thanks, guys. - Jack, this is Principal Samson. He claims Tushka does not work outta his school. - [Jack] Mr. Samson. - [Paul] Hey little girl, what's your name? - Lisa. (sobbing) - Don't you touch her! - Get outta the way. - Oh, don't tell me that. - It's true! We don't cooperate with him. - Listen, Redstone has had it. Beams' march is not gonna amount to shit! - This is a school, not Tushka! I don't know anything about Tushka or the things they do! - Come here, it's okay. It's okay. Come here little girl. It's okay, baby, come here. Come here. - No, no! (gun firing) (screaming) - Where is he?! Dammit boy, I said where is he?! Where?! - Jack! Jack! (groaning) - What's your name, little girl? - Lisa. - Lisa who? - Lisa Samson. - Are you a good little girl? - I have to find him, Tom. - Yeah, we will. I mean, that guy will kill every Indian in Oklahoma before he lets Beams get away. - Who, Williams? - Yeah. - Hello, Principal. Have someone who wants to see you. - [Principal] Lisa. - Oh, don't tell me you think he's some kind of a hero now. - He's no hero. He's crazy. Anything for God and country. - How did he get Littledove's confession? - Oh, he messed that boy up. I mean, he beat him 'til he was almost dead (groaning) and get in his face. - You will talk, boy. Do you hear me?! Huh?! You will talk! - So, Alex tried to tell him something, but I guess it wasn't what he wanted to hear. So, he picks up a crowbar, smashes him across the face. And it didn't matter. I mean, no matter what, he was able to revive him. - Okay man, okay. - He was ready to talk then. And you know me, Jack, I'm not opposed to coercion. But he is playing on an entirely different level. He's dangerous, Jack. I mean, that's all I'm saying. You know, whatever it takes. That's where he's different from us. - They've all split up, but Beams is still here. He's leaving tomorrow morning, Route 66. - [Jack] Who told you this? - [Agent] Samson. (sobbing) - Marcus, this is gonna get everybody in trouble. - It's his only chance. - Why can't we go with you? - I'm the cause of the trouble and it will follow me. When I leave, it should get quiet around here. - We wanna be with you. - It's the best thing. - You should listen to my daughter. Never split up your family, Marcus. - It's going to be violent, Tina. I let you come before, but now one of us has to stay behind and watch the kids. - Oh, is that so? So, why don't I go and you stay? - Because I'm not gonna let you be one of those that don't come back. - Why are you up? - Where are you wanting to go, Daddy? - Tell her, Marcus. - I'm going to see Leonard. - But I thought he was in Heaven. - No, he's fine, but they wanna hurt him, baby, so I have to go there. We're gonna try and get him. - That'll be dangerous, huh? - I don't think your girls should come. I want you to stay here and protect Mommy. Can you do that? I'll be back in a few days and Leonard'll be safe. Don't you think I need to go? - Yeah, safe, right. Amanda, this is dangerous. Your daddy could be hurt. - If you wanna help Leonard. - What about you, do you feel safe? - Mommy can protect us. - Come here. Oh, you're getting so big. Do you want Daddy to go? - I want Leonard back. - Fine. - This isn't the right choice. (speaking foreign language) - Alex. - Don't. Just leave me alone, man. Don't tell me anything. I'll just give up that information too. - But Alex, we need you. - I'm not going anywhere. It was that same white man that killed us before. He's not like Raines or the others. He said he knew everything: my ex-wife, my daughter, my mom. - [Marcus] What else did he say? - He didn't have to say anything else. He was gonna kill them. He wanted me to live. He said he knew everything, Marcus, and that he was gonna use it against us. I can't go to Washington with you. I won't go. Just leave me outta this. - Oh, come on man, we need you. - Marcus. (flute whistling) (tribal chanting) (dramatic orchestral music) - Well, lookie here. Looks like we got him! - Get them feds over here from 66. - Call the feds, Billy. - I told you. Bring him along. - Raines, this is Main Road. Do you copy, over? - [Billy] What in the hell are you doing? - I was just calling in. - Go over there and... - [Jack] This is Raines, over. - Go on, both of you. - [Jack] This is Raines at 66, over. - This is Billy, over. - [Jack] Go ahead. - Problem Raines, over. - [Jack] Go ahead, over. - The perpetrators have... Perpetrators have not been through here at all. Any luck? Over. - [Jack] No, none here. - Always needed help. (speaking foreign language) - That's right. - [Billy] Did I scare ya? - Hell no. - I was. (laughing) - [Jack] Now, keep the road blocked. (slow orchestral music) - Dammit! - What now? (rotary phone dialing) Who are you calling? You don't know what to do now. - So, tell me what to do, since you seem to think you have all the answers. - [Paul] You have to hurt him for real, Jack. - He's gone. - [Paul] That's right, so make him regret it. - What? - Jack, there's certain things you have to do out here to make these people understand. Your dad, your dad... - What did my dad do to the Panthers? - I remember old Harold had Chicago about wrapped up. But ol' Fred Hampton, we couldn't break him. But your dad gave that boy hell. He still wasn't gonna quit. Then we finally decided we needed somebody on the inside. Now, it ain't easy to get somebody on the inside. Took us a few months to get him deep, but we did it. We got somebody right next to him. Occupation was given to James O'Neil to be Fred Hampton's right-hand man. We pumped that boy every day for info, eventually got some good results. Got a map from O'Neil, an exact copy of memory. Your dad, he jumped on that chance. He not only had us gear up in riot armor, he had CPD beat us there. He also ordered O'Neil to drug Hampton. So the feds, we snuck through the back while CPD forced their way through the front. It wasn't pretty, Jack. We went in there shooting. There wasn't a nigger coming out alive. Your dad flew in, went straight to the back bedroom, ripped out his .38 with the holster still attached, kicked down the door, starting firing relentlessly. He shot that nigger in the head, just as we got there to see it, Jack. He shot him in the head. Went all the way on that one, Jack. Hampton wasn't gonna quit, regardless of what we did. Your dad knew the only way to end it was to kill him. This is strange. After he shot that boy in the head, he goes over to him, yanks him up outta that bed, drags him across the floor and drops him right there where we're at. He didn't take no shit, kiddo. He wanted it. So, look, this is the way it has to be done. Beams has to be treated with that kind of extreme prejudice. (dramatic orchestral music) Your dad really understood, kiddo. He didn't take any shit. (retching) This is how it has to be done. - What do you expect me to do? There are more than 80 roads from here to DC. I can't get that kinda support now. - I haven't even seen you close to him since I've been out here. - You're saying my investigation is not producing? - You don't even know where he keeps his family. Someone knows, but you don't even pursue that, Jack. We can get through to Beams with them. - Get through to him? - Jack, we've blown it. We have one choice now, and that's his family. - What are you saying? - You know exactly what I'm saying. - [Jack] No, I don't! - That's the way we play it, boy. - That's the way you play it. - And that's the way your dad played it. Your dad was legendary for a reason, Jack. Now you have to do the same. (flute whistling) You have a duty to neutralize these subversives and I'm gonna see that you do it. Family's just a weakness, Jack. You've got to exploit that. - All right, what is it you wanna do? - We find out where Beams stashes his family and we go there. I'm tired of messing with this guy, Jack. People are gonna suffer for this. - No, we are not going to do that, but you are going back to DC. - I ain't going nowhere. This is my assignment too. - You're not staying here, you son of a bitch. - We're going to do this thing, Jack. - Like hell. - We have really had it. - They have a file on me so large it has exceeded 15,000 pages. And what the hell have I done to fill a file that large? - Now you were saying? - We are at a standstill. (flute whistling) We've become strangers in our own land. We don't know an Indian from a white man. We've lost our identity, and I believe America has done the same. America's founding fathers created an identity it never intended to execute. We did something special here when it was his land and just us. My grandfather talked about the soldiers at Wounded Knee. He talked about the martyrs there. And now, my children will do the same for me. But now the martyr is Leonard. And they don't send soldiers, today they send the FBI. The FBI has hurt men, women, and children alike. That's the way it used to be and that's the way it is now. Today, they are still shooting at us like they used to, and today we are still fighting like we used to. We die a little more every day, and with us goes our culture. We have to do what we can to keep our ancestors alive within us. We have to see that this represents our enemy. This represents a genocide that has lasted for half a millennium. It represents the soldiers who killed my ancestors. It represents the feds who kill my brothers and sisters. That is why I say this. This is my statement to America. This is what I think of what they've done to our country. And we will fight 'em. We will fight 'em forever. - Now, what the hell you gonna do? He just ruined us, Jack, and he's gonna keep on going. Nothing like this in my career has ever happened. It's gotten completely crazy, Jack. He's burning a US flag on our home turf. Your father would want you to. (flames crackling) - Me and Paul got an errand to run. - He'll know this. He knew a lotta stuff, he just didn't wanna talk. Now I've had it with him. (branch cracking) (dramatic orchestral music) (flute whistling) (crowd applauding) (gun firing) (crowd applauding) - All right, time to come in. - Come on, Mom. - [Tina] Come on in. You too, Christy. (dramatic orchestral music) - What have we got back here? What's in the trunk, Jack? All right, no problem. Hey, you got something to do. - Yeah, so do you. Keep your hands off me. - We're here to teach that red nigger a lesson. - Well, this can't be it. - What's your problem now? - This isn't right! - Was you watching TV? How in the hell does that make you feel seeing your assignment do that? - [Jack] Just shut the hell up. - [Paul] What are you doing? - Look, I am not doing this! I'll get him one way or another. But this, no way! - What the hell you been doing out here for three years? He's more popular now than he was when you got here. You ain't done shit. - All right, all right. But what the hell is this gonna prove? - This'll kill that boy's desire for subversive behavior. You heard what he said, he loves his family. And once they're punished for his actions, he'll stop. - You can't be this sick. This is his family! - Casualties of war, Jack. - Is that what this is to you? - You're goddamn right. Things ain't changed, Jack. They haven't changed a bit. Every time we start winning, they run to the damn forest and we can't catch 'em. Their family's what keeps their medicine strong, Jack. And once we take that away, we got 'em. - They don't have anything to do with this! - [Paul] Yes they do. They have everything to do with this, Jack. - I suppose now you're gonna tell me my father woulda said the same thing. - Your dad would've had that little red nigger in a body bag by now, but he's not here. He's got to be taught a lesson, Jack. I remember your dad right before he kicked that door in. He looked at the squad and he said, "I've not lost an assignment. "Before that ever happens, I'll kill myself." Pulled out his .38. Think about it, kid. This is best. Don't you disgrace his memory. (sighs) I don't believe this. (dramatic orchestral music) (tribal chanting) (gasoline splashing) (flames crackling) - How you doing, brother? Everything good for you like that, okay brother? This is gonna mean something for Leonard. I think we've finally been noticed. - I hope so. - Oh my god, I think we found something. - Engine Four, fire department. - [Man] Go ahead. - Guys, we have a situation out here. You need to call the county coroner immediately. - [Man] Roger. - Engine Four, clear. - I know. Yes sir. Well it's taken so long... Williams. Well, I am embarrassed, sir, but... I have, yes. Yes sir, I have. He will be neutralized, sir. Well, yes sir, my father would've been proud. Yes sir. - [Paul] They found 'em. - It's over there. They brought 'em in this morning. The woman was really beautiful. Her name was (pausing) Tina, Tina Beams, age 27. She really went in a bad way. She was awake. - Thank you, doctor. - Would you like to see the rest? There's not much left of the others. - No, that'll be fine. - Jack, we have to see them all. - The remains of the others are on the slab. The children, there were three, a five-year-old girl, Amanda, a two-year-old girl, Christy, and an infant boy, Eli. Here we are. - Jack, come and see. All right, let's have a look. - [Doctor] Let's see. Oh yes, the grandmother. She was closest to the fire. Nothing is left of her. - Oh my, you're right, doc. Not a whole lot to speak of indeed. - [Doctor] The coroner said some pieces were broke off when they were salvaged. They just blow away when they're that charred. - Jack, you have to make a report, come and see. (somber orchestral music) Do you have any questions for the doctor? Jack? - No. No, none. - You're sweating. Thank you, doctor. We'll be on our way. Done a good job, Jack. I'll be sure to file my report honestly. - File? - Yeah, I'm leaving to Washington in a couple of hours. I'm being transferred again. - But, well what about Beams? - I think Washington knows what's gone on here. Beams'll be nothing you'll have to worry about now. Beams is past. Washington knows that now, Jack. Hey, relax, you did it. Beams has been neutralized. - Wait. What happened to his family. - Who's family? - Hampton. He had a wife and a kid. - Your dad ignored it, Jack. He didn't think it was necessary. I'll see you around, Jack. (somber orchestral music) - Hey, Dad! What's a matter, Dad? (sobbing) (wailing) (flute and drum music)
