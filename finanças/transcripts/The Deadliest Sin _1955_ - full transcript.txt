I got to be careful you know I'm known in this town Yeah,not only in this town,eh? Come on let's have it Sure I should have known It's the way you operate isn't it Mike? Carry your brains around in your hand Back over there out of the light,come on,come on! Mike The gun Help Leave him alone Leave him alone Mike what happened? Who is he? Is he dead? I didn't mean to kill him Mike,answer me, what's this all about? -Where are you're going? -I'm going to get the police Stop that take it easy -Nobody gets the police -But Mike I said take it easy -We all have to get out of here -I just killed a man I can't leave him lying there I can't run away Mike What the matter with you? You've gone nuts ,come on Come on There is no one coming around here anyway I was coming to pick you up I always take a shortcut through here You took a shortcut into a lot of trouble That,that's the man we met with at the bank this morning,wasn't it? Give me the gun Mike Mike,I don't know what you're mixed up in and I don't care All I know is I just shot a man The police are bound to find him Listen No one's going to the police You understand that? No one You won't getaway with it Mike I won't get away with it you're the one that shot him remember? Yes Self defence Well that's rather depends how I tell it doesn't it? God Here Drink it All right Now listen,you dropped Louise off at night school and you came straight back here you got here about 10 after 8,right? Then we went out had a drink some place and got back here about 9 Have you got that? Mike,I don't understand why all these lies Because Because there's a man lying dead in the street out there And you shot him that's why I did something wrong I'm prepared to pay for it But you're naked Besides if you go to the police they drag me into this thing I don't want that Only,I'm not just thinking of myself I'm thinking of Pop and sis You know they think I'm a great guy I don't want to change that What time were you supposed to pick up Louise? 9 30 You'd better get going And Alan Get hold of yourself ah? Darling how would you like to spend all Sunday up on the river? One of the girls invites us her parents have a big launch cause they're madly rich -It sounds fun doesn't it? -Yes,yes it does I must say you don't look very enthusiastic You know I think it's a great idea I thought we'd ask Mike to come along,shall we? Yes Yes,let's ask him Pop gone to bed? -Yes how did the lessons go? -Fine -Like some coffee? -Sure -Did you boys have your drink? -Sure did Where did you go? A little pub down the road The ?? -Wheatsheaf -Yes that's right What's that? I don't know it must be a fire somewhere It sounded more like an ambulance to me or maybe a police car Nothing as exciting as a fire ever happens here around here Alan where are you going? Bye Louise Alan -What's the matter with Alan this evening? - I don't know The constable here found him lying just by there,Sir -When? -9 33 exactly -Well,doc? -Shot in the spine -Just like that -I've just time to say thank you -Been here about an hour -Did you find any weapon?-No,Sir I'll give the old fellow a look over at the mortuary nothing else I can do here -Good night -Good night hang on Give me the label on his clothes Not an entire mark,Sir It started about 20 feet up the road stopped just here -Sutton -Yes sir -I want some pictures of these tire marks -Very good,Sir So that's what all the fuss was about last night An unknown man was found shot in Mill street late last night -Morning -Good morning Mike -Morning sis ,yes that's cute -Oh,Mike -Morning dad -Hello son What's all this about a murder? Here you can have the front page -Have it without the sugar -Thanks Mill street? That's way around here isn't it? Yes,we used to play around there when we were kids remember Mike? Yes how we did I see the council finally agreed to settle that land over at Warfield That should please young Alan Oh yes why is that? Alan's on the church committee he helped draw up the plans for the new church Since when does Alan get religion? Alan's always been a Catholic You should know that Oh yes So he has Bless me Father for I have sinned I have killed a man,Father Just try to tell me what happened? I didn't mean to do it The gun was in my hand I couldn't kill anybody Father,I couldn't Help me please help me Have you told the police about this thing? No I wanted to go to police but Mike wouldn't let me He said they'd hang me God Forgive me -What was that Father ? -In here quick -Bless me Father -Latin In nominee Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti Amen Come to his assistance so he sees his God Grant him Lord an perpetual light shine upon him May he rest in peace,Amen -Are you coming back? -No,I think I walk You take Mrs Pool home I'll see you later -May I speak to you for a moment? -Yes,yes of course Will you get into Inspector Kessler's car Believe me I am as anxious as you are that the person who did this terrible thing should be brought to justice and I would help you in any way I can but you must remember that the church has its laws too Father Neil a man has been murdered I hardly need to be reminded of that Inspector I know I sound very uncooperative but well this whole thing puts me in a very difficult position Hasn't it occurred to you Father that your life might be in danger? Hadn't really given it very much thought The murderer thinks you know something he may get the idea that it would be better if you were dead too Inspector When a man confesses to a priest he speaks not into the air of the priest but into the air of God What the priest hears in these circumstances is an inviolable secret Not even to save his own life may he divulge what he has heard to anyone Of course the Catholic would know that but does the murderer? Good day Father thank you Don't think that this is a conflict between the church and the state,Inspector We both have a duty to observe I respect and understand your position and I hope you understand mine Of course If there was anyway in which I could help you I would,willingly But,I could no more betray the sanctity of the confessional then a doctor can betray the confidence of his consulting room -I understand, Good day Father -Good day Now this is the bullet taken from the man found in Mill street And this one was was taken from the body of Alan Pool The rifling markings are identical in both cases Both fired from the same gun you say Yes,the point fit to automatic So whoever did the Mill street killing also killed Pool It looks that way There must be some connection We don't get one killing a year in this town And then two in two days Did you find anything on the Mill Street body? Not a thing only his clothes Even the makers names has been cut out of those That suit was not made in this country That's that's not English either There's a label here Yes but it didn't tell you anything Lurie's company shirt makers We've checked every shirt maker of that name in the country No luck -Where's the body now? -In the mortuary -Richards -Yes,Sir? Take the photographer down to the mortuary and grab a picture see what the archives can dig up We'd better send a copy to the immigration officers as well Right I've been to every garage in town,nothing These tires shouldn't be difficult to identify No,when we find them -Didn't Alan Pool have a car ? -Yes,Sir -Did you check it -Oh no,Sir I didn't think You certainly didn't I'll bee in my office if you want me Right,come on Mrs Pool,how was your son off financially was he in any difficulties over money ? I'm sure he wasn't He would have told me if he had been Did he go out very much drinking, gambling or anything? Good heavens no,he wasn't that sort of boy at all Did your son take out his car Monday evening Mrs Pool? Monday evening? I don't know Yes,yes I suppose,I think he did Where did he go to? He usually goes out and take Louise to her evening classes on the Monday That's Miss Nelson you know Yes I know Did he actually pick her up,you know? I don't know you better ask her -She lives just -Yes I know the address Well ,thank you very much Mrs Pool I'm sorry we had to ask you so many questions No,no it's all right we let ourselves out,Good Bye But I don't quite see why you're so interested in what Alan was doing on Monday night Surely that has nothing to do with it he was killed the next day Miss Nelson as you know a man was shot and killed not far from here on Monday evening You think that might have something to do with it No,but we can't afford to overlook the possibility After all in a small town like this two murders in two days You see it might help if you could tell us What happened to Alan on Monday evening -Mike, this is inspector -Kessler from Scotland Yard -My brother Mike -Hello -Sgt.. Williams -How do you do,Sir Scotland Yard Well I guess we'll be getting some results pretty quick then We'll do our best You must have some idea who killed Alan Or don't you have any suspects Everyone liked him there's a steady young man went to church never didn't drink didn't gamble So far didn't have an enemy in the world What about his priest,Father Neil have you talked to him? Yes we have but I take it he didn't talk to you about it? He wasn't very helpful Do you think you he know something? Yes I do That's fantastic you mean to say there's a man who might be able to tell you who killed Alan you can't do anything about it Oh can't you subpoena him or something It is what is known as a privileged witness Now Miss Nelson you were telling us what Alan was doing on Monday evening He called me about 8 o'clock to take me to my evening classes and then he and Mike went and had a drink -What time did he get here? -He got back at 10 past 8 -Did he leave straight away? -Yeah -in his car? -Yes Where did he go yo you remember? No I don't,some little pub somewhere The Wheatsheaf wasn't it? Yeah that's right The Wheatsheaf I understand Well,we had a couple of drinks and we came back here And then Alan went to pick up Louise What time would that be? About 9:30 So he was with you from 810 to 930? That's right Well that's about all I want to know really I'm afraid we may have to be back I'm sorry to bother you like that Not at all -Anything we can do to help -Thanks Shall we promise you quick result above we expect but May take a little time Goodbye.Thank you -You are an American Mr. Nelson? -No,I've lived there a few years though That would account for the accent Yes,sort of brushes off on you after a while Yes I've been to New York , it's quite a town Yes I was there a few months just before I came back here Oh were you? Well,good bye Oh Inspector You'll do what you can won't you? Alan was a nice kid I liked him Sister was pretty fond of him too We both like to see you get the guy who did it Yes of course -Good Bye -Good Bye -Take it easy, sis -Oh Mike I'm so glad you're here If anything like this had happened while you were away Sure I know How could Pool been at Mill Street on Monday evening? If he was with Mike Nelson all the time -Driver is there a library in this town? -Yes,Sir,we are very proud of it -Let's have a look at it shall we -Thank you,Sir We got five telephone books for New York -Which is it that you want? -Classified directory? -Here it is -Good -Here you are -Thank you Shirts,shirt maker Lurie and & Shirt makers Oh God whom it belongs always to show mercy unto spirit we humbly beseech thee for the soul of thy servant Alan Pool who has called out of this world -Hello Jack -It's just arrived from Washington Pretty quick these FBI boys You were quite right the dead man was an American -Nick Corey -Yeah,criminal records as long as your arm You know another man got away with 250000 $ I can read Sgt.. They haven't got the other man yet No Do you think that Nelson's carrying around two hundred and fifty thousands $ in cash? That's right -How did it get through the customs? -Has been done before -Where have you been? -Having a drink with the landlord -of a pleasant pub called Wheatsheaf -And? Alan Pool hasn't been in the place since victory night The last time he saw Mike Nelson was five years ago That's something that's still not enough You know sometimes a clever move is worth a thousands facts Question is which way do we move Thank you,Sir -Hello -Good Morning -Good Morning,Sir -Good Morning -How's it going? -Now we are beginning somewhere -Really? -Yes I've been brushing up my criminal law Pound notes,Sir Given that criminal law isn't always the strong point in the policeman -Thank you ,Sir -Thank you There's apparently a fact of witness even a priest is libel to attachment to contempt in the High Court Which means that in the event of a trial we could subpoena father Neil as a material witness for the Crown Of course there isn't likely to be a trial until you make an arrest No,but we're expecting to make an arrest pretty soon now Oh,who? I'm afraid I can't tell you that No,of course not I'll promise you will be the first to know Now Good Bye Seems you're the key to the whole situation Father Neil As far as I can figure out the police don't have enough evidence to convict anyone without your testimony That's why I came here to ask you if you can please tell them what you know I've already made my position quite clear to the police A priest does not discuss what he has heard heard in confession I'm not asking for myself it's for my sister I can't tell you what she's been going through not knowing who killed Alan why he was killed What he was mixed up in There's a lot of nasty rumours going around,Father gossip can be harmful and malicious sometimes more harmful than the truth Mr Nelson,the law both of the church and the state is quite specific on this point -But they could subpoena you -They can of course subpoena me but they cannot force me to give evidence You mean you'd refuse? I have no choice Now you excuse me I have some things to attend to Good night Mr.Nelson Hello there can I give you a lift? Oh it's you I thought it was the other kind of prowler car Good -Were you just passing? -Not exactly I'd rather want to have a talk with you Oh well let's go back to the house then No I really meant to have a talk with you alone So? You had dinner? No Is it possible to persuade you to come and have dinner with me? -That would be very charming of you -Good Roadhouse somewhere here down near the bypass do you know what's that like? Pretty expensive is this dinner going to be on you or the government? -All work with me -Then you better let me suggest someone -Right -Turn left just here This whole thing must be pretty upsetting for you Yes it has been really Not because I was in love with Alan or anything like that Oh,I thought you nearly married It's funny we never even talked about getting married I don't know quite what I would have done if he ever asked me You see,dad and he'd be pretty lost by himself Well,maybe things would be different now your brother is there Well much as I'd like Mike to stay I've got a feeling he's just getting ready to move somewhere else He's got the wanderlust pretty badly,Mike -Coffee for Madam -Yes,please But what did Mike do in America? As far as I can gather everything except run for president -And you Sir? -Yes,black please What do you suppose made him come back home? I don't know The same sort of impulse that made him leave in the first place Mike's a very restless kind of person Like someone who's looking for something and never quite finds it What would your father say when Mike left? Dad didn't say anything it's a sure sign he's angry when he doesn't say anything You see mother had just died and I think he felt that Mike was walking out on us It was quite ridiculous really because I could manage quite well And Mike sent his money from America Was Mike in any trouble over there? Trouble? What do you mean? -With the police for instance -No What makes you think that Has he ever mentioned anyone called Corey? No.Why? We have reason to believe that he was involved in a robbery in America With a man called Corey We also believe that he brought the proceeds of that robbery back here to England several thousand dollars I don't believe it Miss Nelson,you remember that your brother said that he was drinking in the Wheatsheaf on Monday night with Alan Yes We've checked neither he nor Alan were in the pub that night Just what are you getting at Inspector Simply this During the time that your brother said that he was drinking in the pub with Alan A man was killed in Mill Street -but -a man with the name of Corey Good night Inspector Thank you for dinner Next time you want to find out something about Mike ask him yourself instead of pumping me Good Night,Madame Your bill Hi,Sis -You missed supper -I know -Pop gone to bed? -Yeah Good night Mike Good night Looking for something ? Yes,my shoes I wanted to take them to be repaired in the morning They don't seem to be here It doesn't really matter What were you really looking for,Louise? Mike Why did you tell the police you and Alan we're at The Wheatsheaf on Monday evening? What do you mean ? You weren't there at all were you? Who have you been talking to? I met inspector Kessler And what else did inspector Kessler have to tell you Nothing else Yes you,you were right Louise I did lie to the police I didn't want to have to tell you but Alan didn't get back here just after eight just like I said He came back about 9:00 He was in pretty bad shape Clothes were all messed up He was crying He kept saying something about having just killed a man I didn't believe him I thought he was drunk Then he showed me the gun and I know he wasn't kidding So I helped him clean up and then we got rid of the gun Then I thought if the police should get on with it He'd have to have an alibi So I thought up that story about the pub You saw how he was when he brought you back here Remember how he went home with hardly even saying good night And the first thing he did the next day was going to the priest If Alan killed that man,who killed Alan? Hey Mr Do we have to have the same record over and over Yes we do Hey boy -How much? -8 20,Sir Thanks You know there's something about a man who drinks soothing down -What will it be,miss? -Bourbon is fine Men will always have it their own way -Do we? -Don't you? Just because you take a girl out to dinner and buy her a drink you think you own her -There you are,Miss -Thank you You don't have to drink it I need it All your troubles are little ones What are your troubles? Doesn't your wife understand you? Or does she understand you only too well Look I bought you a drink,drink it Who knocked the chip off your shoulder Don't give me that Bogart routine I know your type All tough on the outside but all soft on the inside You know what happens to guys like you? They wind up all alone and nobody cares Oh Well you didn't want to catch fire did you Oh you Oh you Taxi Look I'm sorry about the dress I mean I'd be glad to pay that Have it fixed or Just tell me one thing What did you do it for? I don't know I don't know Come in take your coat off -Would you like a drink? -No thanks Do you think it'll be all right? It'll clean Not to worry You know I don't expect you to believe me I'm not in the habit of picking up stray men in bars Grab me here then Fix yourself a drink I won't be a minute A fashion designer or something? Oh,I'm supposed to be I sold two sketches in the last month Who's the handsome hero? Why didn't you pull yourself a drink You see my landlady's been cleaning out the liquor again Nice looking guy That's my husband -Your husband -He's dead Korea Ah that's too bad Just a minute I think there's some wine in the kitchen What do you like? Beer or wine? Well you haven't any choice but don't bother about that Hey you know something I don't even know your name That's not much help is it? Tells us that Nelson had a criminal record We could arrest every man if had just a criminal record The jails will bulge No,as if I see it The American Nelson gets involved with a man called Corey Together they do a robbery Nelson skips off with the money Corey follows him by plane Meet Nelson the hunch is to cut the money So Nelson kills him Somehow or other Alan Poole gets involved We don't know just how but we know he was there at the time Next day this full confession with Father Neil Nelson suspects this might happen So he follows him and kills him too Hmm,sounds sense to me It sounds sense to me but I doubt it would for the public prosecutor Oh,let's face it we just haven't got a case A good counsel could tear it to shreds in five minutes It all comes back to this priest You really think he knows anything? Of course he knows something I could feel it when I talked to him I could see it in his face It'd be taking a big chance to arrest Nelson And hope that this priest gave evidence in court No court could make him you know I know All right maybe he can't tell us something But he can still help us I shall be over at the church if anything turns up Right This is a Spanish Sauternes it's not quite the same as French Sauternes but -It's very pleasant -Thank you What do you think of it? Very good Well Father what do you say? Well,Inspector I said I'd help you if I possibly could Obviously I couldn't go ahead with the idea Without first thing how you felt about it You realized that even if I knew who killed Alan Poole I could in no way reveal him to you Rather hoping that he's going to reveal himself All we ask you to do is to go about your business in the normal way And leave the rest to us I am going to be something of a sitting target,aren't I? We can't even promise you adequate police protection If the murder spots a uniform within a mile of this church He won't come here We may not even get him before he gets you You know on second thoughts then I'm not so sure that this it is a bit too sweet for my taste I prefer a dryer wine really You'll do it will you? Yes Well,cheers Inspector Your health,Sir Yes,well isn't it an earlier plane? Tomorrow afternoon What time does that get into Cape Town? Friday morning All right Nelson M Nelson I'll send you a money order It'll be there this afternoon All right Leaving? Well,you know me,Sis I don't know I thought I did Well I gotta get down to the post office Why are you taking off like this Mike? Why Cape-town? That's the other side of the world Well that's what I like about it You know new faces new places but who knows I might buy a little farm settle down So long Sis Well you haven't changed much still the same nosy little sister You killed Alan didn't you? Whatever gave you a crazy idea like that It all fits It's the only explanation that makes sense Is it? You killed that man on Mill Street too, didn't you Corey wasn't that his name Corey I don't know what you're talking about You knew him in America didn't you? You were in a robbery together I told you Alan killed him Nice quiet holy little Alan Alan couldn't do a thing like that Couldn't he? Huh that's funny He shot him all right Because I was right there when he did it Well he couldn't keep his mouth shut He had to go blabbing to the priest All right so I shot your boyfriend What does it matter he would have hanged anyway What are you going to do go to the police? Do you want to see your brother hanged? What do you think about pop? Can you imagine that'll happen to him if he finds out? It'll probably kill him When are you leaving Mike? Tomorrow afternoon What's the idea? I'm leaving this house - until you're out of it You're staying here I said you're staying here I don't want anything to happen to my favourite sister You needn't worry,Mike I'm not proud of the fact that my brother is a murderer Kessler I wonder what he wants You stay here Did you get your man inspector? Not yet,Sir Do you think you will? Yes I think we will Good afternoon Mr Nelson good news I think Is your sister about? I'd think she'd like to hear it Well no, she's not she just ran down to the library -Oh -Sit down,Inspector Thanks -Drink? -No thanks What's all this good news? Well I think we finally got somewhere with Father Neil I had a long talk with him last night He agreed to go and see his bishop To ask if in the circumstances he could obtain special permission to reveal Alan Pool's confession Oh I don't know much about the Catholic religion,Inspector But I would have thought he'd have to go to Rome for that sort of permission Apparently not as a matter of fact he telephoned me from London only a few minutes ago He's likely be back here in Tunbridge Tomorrow morning first thing he'll be at the police station to make a full statement Well,it is good news Good afternoon Louise what are you doing here? I thought you were at the library? Goodbye pop I'll ask Mrs. West to keep an eye on you Where are you off to? I'm going to spend the night with Aunt Miriam That's rather a sudden decision to make it,isn't it Louise ? But I don't think you've seen Aunt Miriam since Christmas I know Does she know you're coming? No Don't you think you better let her know first? Goodbye Pop Louise how you going to get there? There's only one train a day to Peter hill and that left two hours ago I'll get there somehow I'll be glad to drive you there I have a car outside It's a very long distance,Inspector It's all right Nothing much to do till tomorrow morning Thank you Good Bye Mr Nelson Good Bye,Inspector You know why she went off like that son? You know what women are like pop They never know which way they're gonna jump Hey Pop Do you believe all that stuff about the priest gonna make a statement We should know in the morning whether it's true or not shouldn't we son? Yeah I'm gonna make myself a cup of tea Hmm OK Hello yes Is Father Neal there please No father Neal is in London on business We don't expect him back until tonight What time tonight? Well if he catches a 6:30 train He ought to be back by 8 o'clock Yes,I see,good night Very grateful to you Inspector Grateful to me for what? For not asking what all this is about A policeman should know not to ask questions Peter Hill 15 miles You're sure I'm not taking you out of your way? No, so long as I'm back in Tunbridge by 8 Won't you try something to eat if I asked you? Excellent but I really have to get back You make it sound very important It is What was it you came to see Mike about yourself? You still suspect him don't you? I'm afraid he's got further than that You mean you're going to arrest him? You are going to arrest him aren't you,tonight That's why you have to get back isn't it?
