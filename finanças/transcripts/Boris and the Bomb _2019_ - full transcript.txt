- Everyone seems to be in hurry for world to end. Have you noticed? Let me tell you a story. Is good one, I promise. Once upon a time, there was a good man with a bad bomb. Story of burden and sacrifice, of love gone terribly wrong and wonderfully right, a quest for nobility, a story of second chances, enormous mistakes. Is complicated story, but is mine and yours. And there you are. And here I am. And now we begin. Okay. Here we are, my bombastic friend, together again, like two atoms fused. I keep hoping I can get rid of you or ignore you. But here we are, once again, on the run. Boris has plan, this time. Oh, you don't believe me? Ha, you never believe me. It's true, I have plan. It's good plan. Plan that may end things without you ending things for us all. Trouble, trouble. - You just beeped. You just beeped. That is not so good. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Ah! Come on. No. Okay, stop it, stop. No, no, no, no, stop, stop, stop it. Boris Ivanov. Nyet. - Boris Eliot Ivanov! Nyet. Come on! You're not listening to me. You never listen to me. Nyet, nyet. - Now, now I must walk faster towards solution. I had plan, but plan will require car. Now very fast car! Now I, ah, this is not good. This is so not good! This not good. This is so not good. Dude! - Only two? I am offended. Still, only four. - Is that it? Get it! - I just got hit with a shovel. You get it. Boris Ivanov. - Hello, Rafael. - You escaped. - You made it possible. Boris' escape brought to you by Rafael. Is that it? Led us right to it. Thank you. That's, seriously, Boris, thank you very much. Right, Dwight? - Super. It's for you. - He's here with us. Take a look for yourself. - Open the bag. - Why don't you open the bag? Oh, that's right, you cannot. You are not here. - Open the bag. - You are like selfie stick for Wallace. - Just show him what's in the bag. - Is it heavy holding a video of man with such big ego? - You think just because you're going to beat up Rafael's men and make them feel weak and pitiful, and then beatin' them within a microsecond of their lives, that I won't get what I want. You might beat these men, but you'll never beat The Group. - Did he just say we were gonna lose? - Hey, you answer to me, not to Wallace! Get the bag! - I'm not supposed to kill you, but I, I really want to. I really do. - Are you okay? I'm so proud of you. You did not go boom. Thank you. Boris! - Get in! - Go, go, go, go! Go, go, go, go. I do not think we are being followed. You can drive more carefully. Ah! God, I took care of it. They are not following. God! - I know it's hard to believe, but not everything is about you. Stay here. Lilly, what has gotten into you? No kid of mine comes home from a dance all covered in blood. - At least it wasn't mine. Delilah had it coming. - You broke her nose. - She picks on kids all the time. And she spread rumors. She spread a rumor about you. - What'd she say? - She said that since you're a yoga teacher, that you probably sell drugs. - Huh? Little shit. Is that why her mother asked me about an eighth? I thought she was talking about eighth grade. - See, even you want to punch her now. I just, I just wanted to remind Delilah why it would be a bad idea to keep pickin' on people, you know, consequences. - Violence only causes more problems. - Right, that's what running away is for. - Mother is right. What? I had a good mother, hm. She would say same thing. I wish I had listened. - Who are you? - Lilly, headphones. What is going on? And why did you call me from Rafael's phone? And what's in the bag? - Uh, I am not sure which question to answer first. To sum up, I may have used your relationship with Rafael to taunt Wallace while escaping torture. - What did you tell Wallace? - I brought him with news of you and Rafael, old news. I did not think you would mind. He was torturing me. - Sorry, brother dear, but I am done paying for your fuck-ups. - He's no use to us dead. Sonia! Your methods aren't working, and we're runnin' out of time. - I hate you. - The feeling is entirely mutual. - Where is the bomb? Maya. - No! You know Maya? What about Maya? Oh, boy, he, uh, he's just trying to turn us against each other. He'll say anything. - What do know, old man? - Rafael and Maya, they were a couple, for several years, secretly, before and after you, probably during as well. They were in love. You were an assignment. Rafael and Maya sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G. - No! Don't even! - He was torturing me. I promise, this is all part of plan. I will-- God! Maya! Maya. - I owed you, Uncle Boris. When my parents died, you were my only family. But you have completely blown up my life with this plan. Get out! Do not call me again. Debt paid in full. - Maya, I-- I am going. I am sorry. I never meant to hurt you. You look more like your mother, every day. - She's dead, and I'm not her. Get out! Who was that? - No one that matters, anymore. - You know, it felt good hitting Delilah. Do you get that, like at all? You've probably never hit anyone. - When we get home, I need you to pack. We're moving tonight. - No, no, no, no, please, Mom. I will take whatever punishment. Do not make me move again, please. - Baby, it's not a punishment. It's just what has to happen. Go pack. We're leaving in 20 minutes. - I never finished unpacking from the last time, not that you would notice or care! Thank you so much for your wonderful job. - I am really messing up that kid. - I am not taking you any further. You're a rude passenger. Now exit the car now. - I'm not getting out of this car. - Section B, paragraph 2 of the Yuber user agreement says, I do not have to take rowdy passengers any further. Please get out of my car. I've asked you nicely, twice. Now please get out. - I don't give a shit. You want me to give you a bad review? I'll give you a bad, I'll call Yuber or Youber or Uber, or whatever the hell you call it. - That's Yuber with a Y. - I don't give a shit. You're gonna drive me to a play. That's what you're gonna do. - I need you to leave the car now, or I'll call the police. - Beautiful, beautiful, fuckin' beautiful, you're a goddamn fuckin' saint. You just saved the whole world by making me late, ya piece of shit. Fuckin' asshole. - No, fuck you! You, you fuckin' arrogant prick! - Come on, Jimmy, only three more months. Money to Life with Stan Jenkins, tired of your boring, one-road life? Fuck yeah. Get on the right path with Stan. That's right, me and you, Stan, me and you. Financial adventure? I just need some financial security. Los Angeles County Mental Hospital. - What the? Who are you, and what are you doin' in my car? - You are Uber driver, no? - No, Yuber, with a Y, and that's not even how Uber or Yuber works. - You pick people up from one place. You drop them off at another, da? - Well, yeah. - Los Angeles County Mental Hospital. - No, no, no, no, no, no. Look, I'm not losin' my job, okay? I got three more months till I can take a vacation in Florida. - Florida? Why would you go to Florida? They have beaches here. I was just at beach. It was very nice, very wet, very sandy. - Florida is as far away as I can get from my ex. Oh, will you look, look at all this sand? We, do you know how hard it is to get sand out of the back seat, huh? Will ya just please leave? - Silly Boris, you forget most important part. Motivation. - Don't, don't shoot, don't shoot, okay? I'll take you wherever you want to go. Just, just, just please don't shoot me. - Okay. I could, but I prefer to try this instead. Is enough? - Uh, yeah. - Okay, Los Angeles County Mental Hospital, please. - Yeah, I'm startin' to think that's exactly where I need to go. - Hey! Hey! - Sorry! But I have to chase the bad guys! A'ron, Scotts, pick up in the backyard. - Come on, we got a cleanup. Wake up, you idiot! Oh! You are an asshole! - Sorry, instinct. Hurry up, hurry up. - Wait. - He's bleeding out. Will you get my hand? - Just... - Thank you. - Woo! - Oh good. - Oh, what the hell's goin' on? Hey, let's hurry up, and relax. - Howdy, boys! It's all right. They got an FBI bitch on my ass, okay? Jimmy-Ray, Ralf, it's kind of a shoot-on-sight sort of deal. So kill her, please, a lot, several times, if necessary. - You want me to shoot her in the eye, Taylor, that's gonna be pretty hard, if she's moving. - No, I, no, shoot on sight. That means, like, when you see her, shoot her. And that's it. - We'll shoot her in the ass! - Thank you, Ralf. - How am I gonna shoot her in the ass if I'm in front of her? Do you want me to go around? - You are dumber than a bucket of wet hair, Jimmy-Ray. - Look, just shoot her when ya, oh! Well, well, whatever did I do to deserve this, Special Agent Holmes? - You stole an experimental stealth drone, Taylor. - Well, I like to look at it as occupyin' a experimental stealth drone. Oh. Ah, Special Agent Holmes. - Senator Duckwall. - How's the FBI treating you since I left. - Uh, what do you want? I'm a little busy. - Hold on. - Oh shit. - Oh shit. - Another heart attack dinner there, for you, Kale. - I'm on a stakeout. I don't recall managing my diet being part of our divorce papers. - Kids, I hate your personal history, okay. It's gross. I'm on the Senate Arms Services Committee, and I'm on some other committees. I need you to find your old friend Boris Ivanov and bring him in. - What'd Boris do now? - He has a nuclear bomb. - Okay, I find that hard to believe. - Hard to believe or not, it's true. Okay? So bring him in alive, or mostly. Be discreet. - Why us? - Because you worked with him for four years. You know how he thinks. You know where he might hide out if he's in a pinch. - Ooh, what does, what does Boris want to do with a bomb? - We don't know. We'd rather not take the risk. - And what's your source? - A mole inside The Group. - The group, which one? - The really old secret terrorist-type, mafia-type group that calls themselves The Group. - Yeah, that's a confusing name. - Very confusing. Hey, is that beer? - You two, get Boris and the bomb, working together, starting now. The fate of the world might be at stake. Oh, I, I, I got to take this call. - But, sir, I, I, I, I have a drone on autopilot shooting at me. I need help. - Pete, Peter, it's Kale. - Oh. Hey, Kale, I'm retired. - Yeah, I know. Have you heard from Boris? - Tell whoever that is, if they wake Zooey, I will cut them. - Is that Amy? You guys have kids? - Uh, yeah, I've got one. Yeah, we got to be quiet. If we wake her up, she's gonna want to play house. So what's Boris gotten into now? - I can't tell you. It's classified, and you are retired. - Retired. Yeah, I know. I get it. Call me if you hear anything. - Yeah, sure. - I see Dada, you! I'm awake! - So how was your honeymoon, huh? - Um, it was-- - Is, how is our honeymoon? You interrupted us, right in the middle-- - Right. - Of playing-- Poker? - I'm surprised you two answered the phone. - Well, we are dedicated to our unit. - Gross. - It's unsettling seeing you two together. - Aw, are you jealous? - Yeah, Pete, we all know you had a crush on me. - No, I didn't. - Yes, you did. - No, no, I didn't. - You're totally crushing on her, and now you're all Mr. Brooding-Unrequited. - Emily's not the person I have a crush on, okay. - Then who? Oh. - All right, we are here. Who are we fighting, again, tonight? - Uh, I think Yakuza, Yakuza? Yeah, Yakuza. Great. - Let's roll. - Okay. Why is it in the middle? - About here? - I got this one. - Heck of a cut you got there. - Ah, it keeps opening up. Very frustrating. - How'd it happen? - Cut myself shaving. - You cut yourself shaving? Why don't I believe you? - You'd be surprised at who might believe that. Great. I'm gonna die. - How's our prisoner? Where is it, Boris? - Nowhere. - Where's our little bomb, nearby? Did you move it, huh, 'cause we looked at the last place you buried it? We found traces of radiation, but we didn't find the bomb, like the last 50 fucking times. Where is the bomb? - Gone poof. Duckwall, I always knew you were part of Group. - Did not. - I did. You're terrible at being double agent. - Okay, I've been in The Group my whole life, and now, I'm a U.S. senator, so I think I got a pretty good grip on it. - If you say so. - You know what, you are full of shit, okay. If you knew it, you would've done something about it. Why haven't you? - Timing. Whoa, whoa! Get him! - So you like to hit? - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. - You should have got stronger gang. - I knew you'd beat them. I'm going to get the bomb. - I know. I'm counting on it. How much longer to mental hospital? - This is Los Angeles. It's gonna be a while. - I'm like, what the fuck is that? And then it happens again. And I try to ignore it, and finally, I'm like, all right, honey, look, that better be a queef, or I'm gonna need my 30 bucks back. You know what I mean? This is not-- - Let me guess, queeving, it sounds like a clown making a balloon animal, followed by something about the F to VE rules. - The fuck you doin' here, Nick? - You stole my queef joke. - I didn't fuckin' steal, oh, really? You stole my You made it a fuckin' cat phrase. You say it at every show. And you put it on a fuckin' T-shirt. - I offered to go halfsies on the T-shirts. - No, you didn't! No, you didn't, eat shit! You never did. Now so fuck you! - Stick my finger up your butt! I have your butt, dude. Hey, hey, I got my finger in your ass, 'cause your jeans are cheap! - Get your finger out of my ass! - I feel your balls, right now! - Get your fuckin' finger-- - I want my queef joke. - Yeah, where's my fuck, I want my hashtag. - Peter. - Hey, Keena. - You'd better get out to the club. - Hey, are you the one who pays us? - Hurry up. Hey, two questions. - Hon! - Hm? - There's trouble out back at the club. - So what's in your sack? - That is very personal question. - Okay, what's your name? - That is also personal question. - Mine's Jimmy. - Boris. - So where you from, Boris? You know, you sound German or Russian, or I don't know. I sometimes get those mixed up. - Jimmy, my new friend, I will pay you $1,000 if you run this red light when I tell you to. - No, no, I'm not breaking laws for you. - 2,000. You don't, $2,000, that's a lot. Uh, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, no, no. - When the people following us catch us, take my sack and kill you, I will let them know you do not like to break laws. - What? Go! - Oh my God, oh, I hate this. I hate this, I hate this! - Okay, turn right, here. Okay, turn left into alley. All right, pull to the right. Cut engine, turn off lights. - Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. - Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. - Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. - Shh, shh, shh, shh. - This is not worth $2,000. 3,000. - Oh shit. - Okay, not that one. I am waiting for the people that I do not want following us to pass. - There's people you do want following you? Sometimes. - Are they gone? - Not likely. Okay, start car, start car, start car, start car. - Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. - Go. Go now! - Why won't the car start? Come on, car. Okay. - Turn! - I'm pretty sure car chases violates some sort of Yuber user agreement. Did they just shoot my car? A little. - A little? - A stronger deterrent. - Gun, gun, you have a gun! Shit, that's a big gun! - Ah, you Americans, so concerned about size. Hold car steady. - Oh my God! Will you hit him or something? You try to do it. You want to trade places? - No, I'll drive. Cops, fuckin' pigs. - It's over. Hi, officer. Keep going, keep going. Yeah, yeah. - Is that it? - No, no. Oh man. - I thought you had them. - You're the one that was driving like a turtle. - Okay. The tail is gone. - But, but what's in the bag? I, I don't want to be part of some drug deal or gang thing. - It's, it's, it's not, it's not gang thing. Oh, actually, it might be gang thing. But, uh, no, it, I am not gang, and it is not drugs. - Is it illegal? Did you kill someone or somethin'? Oh my God, there's, there's not someone's head in that sack, is there? No, of course not. This is just, uh, who I was once upon a time. I was different man when I was younger. I needed less, expected more, easily swayed by honor, by promise. Hey, hey, Boris. - Sorry. Lost in thought. - You know, if I had messed up as many times as you, I would've been sold into slavery by now. - Sonia, shut up. - Ah, look, I'm tracking the bomb. It's leaving a trace of radioactivity, which is increasing, by the way, so we might want to hurry, or it might go off, on its own. Oh. Oh, it's Dante. Did you want the message, or should I just, I should just back off. Just be glad that he's texting me and not you, since Boris has your phone. Goddammit! God, ah,. Nyet. - There, no bag, no one follows us. You get to the loony bin. I get paid and go home and take a sleeping pill chased by a scotch, and we act like this never happened, da? - You threw my sack! - Yeah, I threw your sack. - It is a bomb. Yeah, so it's a bomb, sure. - It is a bomb, a nuclear bomb. Sure, it's a nuclear bomb, right. Da. It's a nuclear bomb? - Da! - In my car, this whole time? What? - If they tamper with bomb, it goes poof. Everything goes poof! Do you want everything to go poof? - I don't want anything to go poof. Shit! - Get down. - Ah! Give up, Boris. This is the second time I've caught you in a matter of hours. It's becoming repetitive. Caught but not captured. There is difference. Yeah, but now, see, now you're not alone. You have a liability. - Have you shot gun before? - I play Call of Duty. - Cover me. Just like Call of Duty, no big deal, huh? - But no, but, Boris, but-- No but, but, but, but, Boris! - Shit! I suck at Call of Duty. - Dante, shoot the sidekick. Dwight, get the bomb. - What the, oh, oh shit! - Ha! - You are a tough little bomb. - So how's our friend back there? Is he ticking, still, or not ticking, or whatever it is you say when you don't want a nuclear bomb to go off in the backseat of your car? - Is safe. Is dented, but safe. Dwight's head very hard. - He got dented. Well, that's not good, right? Oh shit! - It's okay. Bomb is built to take a beating, just like Boris. Or, um, maybe-- - Maybe what, what? Oh, um, never mind. Ah! - Did I shoot you? Oh, great, I'm a murderer! - Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. Rafael shot me before I got into your car. Please, we must get to mental hospital. - Sure you don't need a normal hospital. - No, Los Angeles County Mental Hospital, please. - Oh, okay, we should stop. - No, we don't have time. - It's Boris. He says check the trunk. - Hey, careful, it could, hey, stop! It could be a bomb, stop. Yeah, I'm sure you felt the same way, 12 years ago. Behold, the brat. Hey, Aunt Sonia. - Lilly. - Hey, Dad. - I can't believe you gave up our spot in The Group for that. - Let's go, come on. Surprise. Let's get outta here, come on. - What happened to you? - Drive. You know what, I can't believe it. After everything, you're just gonna betray Boris and hand him over to Duckwall. - Boris may come off all cuddly, with his justice not revenge and all that, but more often than not, he's got his own agenda, and he doesn't care who gets hurt in the process. - 'Cause he's a spy. - Yeah, a rogue one with a nuclear bomb. And I'm gonna bring him in, with or without you. Oh, you find that amusing. - I would love to see you try to bring in Boris, just all by your lonesome. - Captain Corn Dog would go down, all right. - Have a heart attack, running after him, after that hamburger. - Oh yeah. Hey, you still alive? For a moment. - Los Angeles County Mental Hospital. - $6,000, if you wait and take me to next destination. - Eight. - Eight. Eight. - Mine! - Mine. Mine! - Stop stepping on my dreams. - Mine! - This is my mic. - Mine! - I've got five good minutes. - Mine, mine, mine! - I've got five minutes. I gotta do 'em. - Jonny, stop, I'm sorry about this, everybody. Sorry, folks. Sorry about this. Princess, I need you to give the microphone to Jonny. - Tiki Taka Kentucky, home of the surf and turf and veggie burger, how can I help you? - Peter Mulligan. - Peter? - Yeah. Okay, hey, yeah. - Give me my mic. - Mulligan. - Peter? - Boris? - Da. - I'm outta the game. - I know. I need your help. - Oh yeah, hold, hold on a second. Princess, I need you to give-- Honey, I need some help, please! Mine! - All right. - Microphone to Jonny, please. Okay, good girl, good girl, hey, good girl, good girl. - Let's start a comedy club in the backyard, he said. Work from home, he said. So much quality family time, he said. - All clear. - Hello. I need help. - Boris? - Amy! - Da. - Good news, everybody, I have a date Friday night. - Look, we're out of the game, but if you're ever in the area, hit us up. We're always good for a meal. - I look forward to it. I love Kentucky Gumbo. - Hey, what's Kentucky Gumbo? - I never really saw you as motherly type. I am good judge of character. It is why I had you committed. - I'll get that bullet out and sew you up, if you get this thing to shut up! - Aww. Really? Hmm. ♪ Go to sleep, go to sleep ♪ ♪ Go to sleep, little baby ♪ - I honestly never thought of that. Why, Boris, you're radiant. You've been exposed to a significant amount of radiation, low-level, but consistent. What's in the sack? - Nothing, just last meager possession of poor Boris. - Right, you know, I could just let you bleed out and find out for myself. - And I could, uh, I could wake the baby. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, Professor, oi! - Doing okay there, Boris? - I, I, I... What did... Pills. - Hmm, just a few sedatives, antipsychotics, and something I mixed up myself, 'cause I'm a genius chemist. - There are two of you. - You think you can trust anyone, ever? So naive. People do what they need to do for themselves. - Oh. - And they never forget. And they always come back. And they'll always steal your bomb. Professor, I need help. It can't be disarmed. So I can't help you, I can't help you, I can't help you. The big bomb will kill, big bomb will kill, big bomb will kill, big bomb will kill, big bomb will kill. - It might go off, go off. - It could. They'll never know. - Big bomb, big, big, big. Oh dear! - Can you help me? - Yes. Help me now. The big bomb will kill. The big bomb will kill. - Stop! Boris, stop! Gimme the bomb. - I know you. - Yes. - Sammi, Sammi Reddi. You look good, uh, older and bald, but good, particularly for figment of my mind. - We were good friends. - Once upon a time, until I, uh, killed you. - The bomb. - Professor just stole. - I saw. - I do not think I like this hallucination any longer. - Our friendship was real, if that means anything to you. I didn't even mind you falling in love with my wife. - I didn't. - Our marriage was just a cover. - I saved her, that day, and your daughter, the day I ran. I saved her and Maya. - Boris, stop! Gimme the bomb. - You know I cannot. I'm sorry. I never meant to hurt you, Aashirya or your daughter. That's why I'm running. Get down and stop, don't move. - You misunderstand. You did shoot me. That's true. - You are not here. - I am here to kill you and end this. Some things should remain buried. - But you are figment. And you need me to stop bomb. Is counting down. Bomb is broken. - What do you mean the bomb is broken? It was activated. - Bomb is old. Bomb is not so well. - Is it counting down? - Da, less than 48 hours then boom. - Then you must go catch it. Maxine Majors, nurses' station, Maxine Majors, nurses' station. - Stop. You aren't going to shoot me. You're the great morally conflicted Boris. Let me guess, you were supposed to set this sucker off but couldn't do it, the fatal flaw that makes you a tragic hero. Come on, hero. Murder me and save the world. Oh shoot! - It did not go off. Good. Where did I leave Jimmy? Ah! Jimmy, my friend, you did not leave me. - No, I did not. Blame my alimony bill. Boris. - Go away, figment, go away! Let us go. - So who's that bald guy you were yelling at? Is that who you came to meet? - You saw him, too? - Yeah. - Let us go. - You haven't told us where we're goin' yet. Ooh, let me guess, to find a homeless person who does excellent dental. No. That was funny. You're funny man, Jimmy. East, my friend. East is where our fate is met. Okay. Your bomb is outside the window, Boris. Oh. ♪ Skip on over, skip on in ♪ ♪ The search within ♪ - Pick up, dammit. Rafael, pick up. Maya! - Boris? Why do you have Rafael's phone? I took it when escaped. I needed phone. Why? - Lilly's missing. - So why'd you run? - She wants us to move, again. - Oh, it's Boris again. He says, "Call Maya." You know, you really need to get a new phone. - I had a phone. He took my phone. Boris and the bomb and my phone. - Please, Lilly, please. Come on, universe, make my preteen not act like a preteen and call me. Next, we'll talk money. Lilly! - Hey, Mom. - Little girl, do you have any idea-- - I'm okay. I'm with Dad, see? - Hi, she snuck in my trunk, again. - Lilly, headphones now! - I-- Now! - Rafael, what were you thinking? Boris has the bomb. What bomb? The bomb. - Boris had the bomb? If you help me, I can bring in the bomb, the bomb that The Group has been looking for, for 30 years. - Rafael. I can regain my status. - Oh God. - Bring me the bomb and we can all start over again. We can be a family. So how long exactly have you been carrying that bomb around? Uh,, uh, 30 years. Bomb was evidence, but I didn't know who to trust. So I buried the bomb, again and again. I walked around the world with my bomb, with my burden, like a fool. - Well, at least you traveled. - Do you hear that, little bomb? We traveled. What am I doing? Why am I here? Get the bag. Get the stroller. - Gettin' the stroller. Let's go! - Got it? - I got it. - Let's go. - Want me to get it? - No, no, I got it. Ah, ah, ah, ah! I got it, got it. Let's go! Let's go! - Get in there! Get! Get, get! Let's go. Who's ready to go to Dollywood? - Are you sure about this? Boris is-- - Yes, family. Family time always comes first. - Go, Daddy, go! - But what about Kentucky Gumbo? - Yeah, that's, uh, it's a little troubling, but we'll be back before. Okay. - Poop. - Go, go, Daddy! - Come on, guys, we're on a schedule. We've got a lot to-- And who are you supposed to be? - My dad told me not to move, so I'm not moving. - You're Maya's little chick, aren't you? How old are you, exactly? - I'm 12. Why? - No reason.

Pass him, and there's a tunnel. - I've been trying that for weeks. I was gonna delete the game. - Try it. Go on. Yeah? That's it. That's it. You did it. That's it! Thank you. What do I do at the tunnel? - You explore. - Tired, I need to stop. What do you say we find a B&B that takes same-day arrivals? There's this app. Bomb is okay. Sleep would be good, short sleep, very short. - And there it is. Ah, great. We're right next to a freeway. We're never gonna be able to sleep. No wonder it's so cheap. - Why is my neck bleeding? - Oh, you were sleep-fighting. And you lost. - I lost? - Oh good, perfect timing. We just had a couple cancel on us. Okay, I'm not gonna lie. They walked out, but it wasn't because of anything we did. - Oh, are these our heroes? Hi, I'm Dani. You have saved Francis and me. I swear it wasn't because of anything we did. - What's in your bag? - Uh, is, uh, just laundry, eh. - Oh, well, I'd be happy to wash it for you. We're full-service. Happy to wash it. - I'd rather not. - Oh no, really. - Really, no. - It's free. - It's okay. - No trouble. - It's okay. - Okay, let me-- - It's okay! Okay. Well, anyway, I think you'll really love the room. It's very big. It's very spacious. - Very spacious, very comfortable. - Sounds perfect. - We will not be staying long. Okay. Hey, are you okay? - Yeah, no, I'm sure I just cut myself shaving. - I have Neosporin. - Trouble sleeping? - It's mocking me. Look at it. It's smirking. - Is it better? - I guess. You know, I've never actually seen it. - The bomb? Do you want to see? - Yeah. No. Yeah, uh, no. Yeah, let me see it. Wait, no! No, the less I know the better, you know, when I get interviewed by Homeland Security and taken to a black site. - Are you sure? - Shit, just show me. Can I touch it? - You want to touch my bomb inside my sack? - Hey, come on. - Just teasing, go ahead. It's warm. - It's warm? - Is that bad? - No, it's fine. It is old. It's warm. - Uh-huh. - It's okay. - How did you get this? - That was not so okay. I was young, wanted to make impression, volunteer for special program, big Soviet honor in KGB. I was a fool. - So who's the girl? - Her name was Aashirya. And I was in love with her. And she was in love with my best friend, Sammi Reddi, as the story always goes. They had Maya. They were a family. I was to detonate bomb in London, set timer with my partner Nikolai, get out in time to stay alive. What is so funny? - I had a change of heart. Oh, my friend's daughter Maya told me joke, this morning. Here it is. Knock, knock. - Who's there? - Knock, knock. - Who's there? - Knock, knock. - Who's there? - It's your cousin Knock Knock, from next door. Subject, Nikolai. - And so I ran. And still run. Good. And I will tuck you in, too. Nighty-night, little bomb. - We tracked the bomb to Missouri, just outside Saint Louis. He used the B&B app we sent, group-friendly safehouses. - Right-o. Dwight, find this B&B he speaks of. It's called BGB&B, Bad Guys' B&B. - I don't care! Stop talking. You're boring me. Just book it. - It's clear night. To think each of those stars is filled with little bombs, like you, huh, exploding and exploding. Poof, poof, poof, poof. Is matter. Is not matter. One moment, is, one moment, is not. Or is that Hamlet? I may still be very high from professor's drugs. - Is that why you decided to destroy my life, Because I don't matter or I just don't matter enough? - Maya. - I know you killed my father. I know it was you that ran. God, all this time, I thought... I infiltrated The Group to find his killer! - It's not what you think. I ran to protect you and your mother. If I had not, you would both have died in the explosion. As long as I am alive and bomb is hidden, buried, The Group could not touch me or the people I care for. - I don't know if I believe you. - I wouldn't want to sleep in this site. It makes one soft. - I have my daughter with me, and I appreciate security over arcane ideas of manliness. - Yes. Anything for the daughter. We require lodging. - But first we're gonna discuss the rules. If there's going to be any killings, I'd prefer if you do them outside. For body disposal, we have plastic sheeting in the plastic sheeting room. There's also bleach in the bleach room. And I need all of your weapons to be stored outside in the provided cubbies because of the residue. You understand. This way, please. - What do you mean you don't have the bomb? - Not to worry, I can track bomb but only from so far. She's just ahead of us, leading us to final chapter. We must hurry, 'cause time is ticking. - I'm hurrying. I'm not even awake yet, but I'm hurrying. - No, I meant clock on bomb is ticking. We have less than 30 hours before poof. - I hate you. - Another one left. - We're not doin' somethin' right. - We? - You know what would really turn me on? - What? - The bomb, a big, fat nuclear bomb. - Oh Sonia. - Get me the bomb. ♪ You know where to find me ♪ ♪ I can't help what happens if you stay ♪ ♪ You're making me regret ♪ - Who slammed that door, hmm? And you, you can't have food outside of the dining room. I have a peanut allergy, ah! ♪ Take your best shot ♪ ♪ Give it all you got ♪ ♪ Watch me as I work so you could tell me if it's hot ♪ - Ah. Welcome home, little bird. - I brought you the bomb. Now let me take Lilly and go. ♪ It's what I do ♪ - Is it counting down? Yes. - We'd better hurry then. - Shit! - Peter! - Who's Peter? - He's my old partner. - He doesn't want to kill you, does he? - I hope not. Peter. You got my text. - Next time, not so many emojis. Almost went to Mexico. - Oh. - Mexico! - Ah! Are you ready for this? - I didn't just drive six hours to turn around and go home and get yelled at by Amy. She said, "Find the bomb, save the world, "it's on the couch, you." - If we don't get this thing, I don't think there's gonna be a couch left. He knows it's nuclear, right? - Yeah, I know. Who's this? - Oh, this is Jimmy, my Uber driver. - Well, Yuber with a Y, high-five! - So, did you get the help I asked for? - Yeah, they should be arriving at the Tiki Taka Kentucky now. They said they may have a solution. - Let's hope so. Now, let's go get the bomb back. - We're going to Kentucky? Da. - I am so miserable. I am just so happy. I'm not gonna lie. Can I take a swig off your drink? What is this? - Hello! - Oh! - 10 buck cover. Oh, um, did someone here call about a bomb? - A nuclear bomb, specifically. - We're closed. Everybody, out! - All right, fine, we will find Boris. We'll figure out what's going on, and then we'll decide what to do. - This time, let's keep 'em till breakfast. This is a bed and breakfast, not just a bed. Okay. Hello! - Hi. - Hello. - We heard about a room. We just got remarried, yeah. - Oh. - Yeah, do you have a room? - Yes, one just opened up. A Russian guy just took off with his boyfriend. - How long ago? - About an hour. - Russian guy. - Wait! You can't just come in like that. That's not how this works. - We're FBI. It's how we work. I'm sorry, you said he had a boyfriend, really? - I think they were just friends. Dani sees love everywhere. Oh, that's nice. - Really? - Yeah, it's cute sometimes. - Really? - Sometimes. - They said they left in a car that seemed to be an Uber or something. I don't know. Maybe we could track it. - Well, you know exactly where he'll head. Peter. - Peter. - Hey, we could, uh, crash here for a couple of hours, if you want. - Maybe. - Maybe. - Maybe. - Thank you for that. That was beautiful. You stole my child, Maya. Lilly, she is mine, isn't she? Isn't she? - Yes. - Jeez. - I see Maya brought the bomb, and not to you. - Dad, my phone's dead, and the weirdo host won't let me charge. I'm gonna go in the car. - It's okay, Lilly bug, do whatever you need. - She's Wallace's, isn't she? We can use this. We can leverage Lilly. - Maya, hold on, listen up! Rafael. - Finally, I have a good enough reason to end you. Bloody hell. - Dad! - Sorry. - Get away from my dad, now! - Lilly! I promise I'll explain later, but right now, I need you to put down the gun. - I'm okay, sweetie, I'm okay. I love you, put, put the gun down, come on. There you go. - Shh. It's all right. So since everyone's lost their minds, and I have the bomb, I'm taking control. Daddy! - Sonia, come on now, put the gun down. - Did you not notice the bomb ticking down? No more liabilities. Hah! You guys go ahead. I'll wait here. - Ah, ah! - Give me the gun! - No, let go, you stupid brat. You're trying to kill my mom! Yeah. Lilly! Well done, Lilly. That's my girl. - Ah! - Kale! - This-- - It's okay. - This is not good. - No, you're fine. You're fine, you're gonna be fine. It's fine, you're great. Okay, okay, baby, okay? - I missed this. - What, getting shot? - You. Don't die, don't die, don't die on me, don't die on me, Kale. Don't you fuckin' die on me. - I'm sorry. - Don't you fucking die. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. No! - For bomb that has yet to go off, so much destruction. I am sorry about your father. - I know. - We need to go. They're waiting on us. - Why did you kill him? - He shot. I reacted, reflexes. It's not the first time we shot each other. But I am not sure now what really happened. I may be very wrong. - What do you mean? - I must go. - Go, go, go. - Shh! Boris, wait for me! - I'm taking Lilly. I know. Drive as fast and as far as you can go. I'll be in touch if, when I can. - Oh, don't worry, she'll be safe with me. Hey, are you okay? - I wish I could tell you how not okay I am. Baby, hey. I love you. - Love you, too. And I like the British accent. - Yeah, you didn't have that before, did you? - Go, go. - Let's go. - Get to your feet. We know where they're going. - No, the FBI will not be cleaning your carpet. I don't care whose blood it is. - What? - I thought the blood actually accents the-- - So, well, what if it was your blood, huh? Would the FBI come and clean that up? - Yes, of course. - Don't help the psychopaths. - So what happened? - Larry wants his brother Barry to kill A'ron so the FBI will pay to clean up all the blood. - Right. - Yeah, remind me to never ever talk to you first again. - Yes, sir. - A'ron. - Looks like The Group was staying here. - Did you transport Kale's body from the other B&B? - Yes, but it was just him and the two women, no assailant. - Well, that's not good. Well, who died at this B&B? It wasn't Boris' blood, was it? - No, uh, Wallace and a woman, uh, a Sonia. - Well, I know where they're off to, then. Okay, take these two in, secure this site and meet me in the third act. I have a feeling there's gonna be a higher body count. - Oh, and apparently the bomb is ticking down! - Probably should've led with that. Now, turn around. - Barry, get him! - We're close. - You've made a mess. - She's not mine. - Not yours? You raised her. You were there at her birth, her first birthday, her first word. You seemed happy. - You knew. - I know everything about my granddaughter Lilly. When this is over, I'll make sure that you go and raise Lilly somewhere in peace, until she's ready to help with the cause. - And where are we going? Why don't we just have Boris deal with the bomb? - Boris' bomb is not the only bomb. Oh, goody, story time, just what we need. Can you step on it, please? - Seven bombs, seven continents, seven pairs of agents, reset the world, turn it off, turn it back on again, that was the plan. And we enter the chaos and run the world. Boris' bomb was the key bomb. When it went off, it would've triggered the other six. - And what happened? - Boris. He grew a conscience, in love with my wife. It was the '80s. It turns out we didn't need a nuclear solution. The Group was back to power with the most predictable of devices, politics. Right, Senator Duckwall? - And we can't have a nuclear war. We would never get reelected. - Why not help Boris disarm the bomb? - Because it is not his bomb. It's mine. Is that him? Is that Boris? - Yeah. - Run him off the road. Oh shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. Oh shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. - Where's Boris? - I don't know. - How's the bomb doing? - You may want to speed up. Did you miss it? - I'm semi-retired. I don't do fieldwork, but I dabble. Amy hates it when I dabble. You know, we surprisingly run a successful comedy club in suburban Kentucky. That and a three-year-old, I don't have a lot of free time. Ah. - Of course now I'm driving a dented, smoking, countdown nuclear bomb towards my family, which could all go boom, thanks to you. - I know, I know. - Look, I'm not trying to be an asshole. It's just I do have a wife and a kid. And that's a nuclear bomb. - You have a life. I will not let you down, just because I made different choice.

Don't worry. Ooh! - Gently. Come, Dr. Baker! Dr. Baker, let's go. Careful. - The gate, the gate! It's badly damaged, dented. - Did someone use this nuclear bomb as a weapon? - You should get the club. Amy needs you. - Oh, you mean she's mad at me. - Yes. Coming, sweetie! - Don't even think about it. - All right? - I am fine. - I'm taking you in. - First, I have to stop bomb. Then, if you must-- - I know that Duckwall is involved. I get that that bomb is a nuke and probably about to go off. I get all of that. What I don't understand is why did Kale have to die? - Kale is dead? - Yeah, Boris, Kale is dead, chasing you. Here we go. - We have six hours left. - Are you okay? - I'm okay? He asks me if I'm okay? No, no, I am not okay! You're supposed to be semi-retired, not bringing us closer to Armageddon. - I am semi-retired. - Dammit! Does, does that look semi-retired to me? - I knew you'd be angry! And those are your knives. - We're here. Um, you know, I'll just, um-- - Dwight, would you please take care of the driver? What are we waiting for? Boris is in there with the bomb. - So impulsive. If you're gonna lead The Group, you need to learn patience. Show that to me, today. - How? - Kill Maya. - Maya took Lilly and ran. I have no idea where they are. No, she didn't. - You never cared before. What changed? - I'm pregnant! Oops! - Oops? - You're pregnant? Again? - You just say oops? - Yes, first, congratulations on the baby. Second, the bomb, we have, um, we have 20 minutes now. - How exactly is it that you're being helpful? - I am sorry for Kale. He was my friend, too. - He was my husband. I don't give a shit what the fuck this is about anymore. I don't care about The Group or Wallace or Maya or your damned, stupid, fucking past! Kale is dead. - Emily. - It just went from six hours to 20 minutes, Boris. - When this is over, you're so fucking mine! - What happened to bomb? - Uh, we had a bit of an oops. - My family's about to die in a nuclear explosion, and all you can say is oops? - Well, there is some good news. - We may have neutralized the polarity with this device. - And? - Potentially no boom. - Or potentially bigger boom. - Or potentially small boom. - Well, you two are very reassuring. Okay, how far away can we get in the next 18 minutes? - Not far enough. - Ah, Boris, now would you grab the handle of the bomb? - I need my old partner Nikolai or the biometrics not work. - I can save your information into the limited memory of the computer, as old as it is, and that might get us halfway to disarming it. - Is true? - Couldn't hurt at this point. - Boris Ivanov. Oh sure. - Well, that's good, right? Okay. - We're all gonna die. - Sammi's alive. - I thought he was a bad guy. - Turns out no. Oh, it's Jimmy, my Uber driver. - Yuber with a Y. - He is with me. It was not a dream? - No, and he's here. You want to fill them in. - Make it count. - Oh, I will. Got him. - For once, I wish you'd fill us in on the whole plan. - Right? - Not that this isn't fascinating, but we do have a nuclear bomb here set to explode in, oh, 18 minutes. - Not one, seven. - This bomb is key bomb. If it goes off, bombs in countries all over the world go off. The Group used the KGB to try to start world war. They framed Russia, also USA. - Our latest intel shows that six bombs are still out there. - That's just fucking great! - Oh, and I'm CIA, so you might want to put your guns down. - Where's Lilly? - She's safe. - 17 minutes. - Incoming hostiles! Lots of incoming hostiles! - No, no, no, no, no guns, please. The bomb's in such a fragile state that one stray bullet could set this off. - Huh? - Take that! Peter! - Love you, baby. - Love you, baby. On your three! - Catch assist. You're pregnant? - Yeah. - Sweet. - Oh, Boris, oh. Oh, I can't look. - No, it can't be 3.5. It was 3.25. - It's not working. It's not working! - Come on, Dwight, come on! - Oh sure. - I'm in stasis! - Well, Dr. Baker, stasis is death. Armando! - Fuck that. - Sammi. - Hello, old friend. - No! - Get Boris. - Fuck this. - Maya, my sweet Maya. - You died. I was at your funeral. - My shift simply ended. I went home to my real family. - No. - I'm sorry, for what it's worth. It seems a waste but not entirely. We have Lilly. - What do you mean? - No! Let go of me! - Why are you doing this? I'm your daughter. - The legacy, The Group. - You keep Lilly out of this. - Too late. Given that her bloodline is filled with mine and Wallace's and raised by your boyfriend, or whatever you think he is. But he's loyal, and I like that. I can't have another anchor to my past. - Sammi! - Boris. - I killed you! - Not very well. - And now you want the bomb to go off! - A lot you know. I can't risk The Group losing power because of an old KGB washout and an ancient bomb! Pathetic! - This is more fun than I remember. I love watching you fight. Peter! Here, here, let me see. Ah, it's not too bad. - Yeah, yeah. - Stop fooling around and get the bomb! - I may have used all your data. - You ruined everything. - I saved your-- - They were not my family! They were job, just like you. Now I'm trying to save my real family, but you have to be so noble. I'll get that bomb and stop it or die trying. You have to die! - You do know how to drive, right? - It's time for the end, my little bomb friend. I had so hoped I could avoid you going boom. But I made mistake, many mistakes. I was arrogant.
