What are you doing? Hey, stop eating, the train's coming. If I miss my train I'll tell the station master. Hey, don't you know me? I'm no ordinary man, I'm a town councilor. Coming. What's this? You may be a town councilor but you can't stop the express. Yes, I campaigned so hard to have the express stop here, but I failed. Without the express it's definitely inconvenient. How much to Shiobara? If the express stopped here this town would certainly be more developed. 2-yen 29-sen. The population decreases every year, so for the railway it's not worth it. How can we be proud of our town when the express never stops? One adult, one child. Where to? Well, Osha... Oshamanbe. In Hokkaido. I see. Well, one adult, one child, isn't it? No, two children. No, no, one child. Isn't the small one going? He's going, but he's too small. How old? Under school age. I don't think so. What is your grade? - 3rd grade. - See? Two children. One for Hakoyama. 21-sen. Father. I don't want to. Fool. You can't even eat millet or wheat at home, this is much better for you. I can eat pumpkin, potato or whatever. I don't want to go. You'll see once you get there. You can eat white rice and wear colorful kimonos. That's really heaven. Father, he's lying. My schoolmate wrote to me, so I know the truth. She has to work early in the morning till late at night. Nothing is good, it's like a prison. She's lying. It's true. Now, I'll buy the tickets. Are you sick? I have some medicine. Well, 13:25... Will you tell me where the Seifukan inn is? If you know, please tell me. Seifukan? Sounds familiar, but... Excuse me, sir, where is Seifukan? Seifukan? Yes. I know a Seifukan, but it was bankrupted and is empty since last year. Oh, what's to be done? Do you now where the people from the inn have gone to? I don't know because they ran away in the night. You might find out if you go to the police. For Aomori. Could you help us, please? I can't leave this child alone. Please, sir. No kidding. Who would ask for the reduction on a train ticket? No. Please. Shimoyama one. If you are farming here, you'll never get a good marriage. But if you come with me and work for three years or so, then you can marry as you like with two or three chests full of kimonos. - No, let's go. - Will you wait? Who are you? - My school teacher. - Teacher? A teacher must have taught you to follow what father says. Let's go for father's sake. Harukichi-san and I have agreed on the girl's future. I don't know what you and Harukichi-san agreed, but Harukichi-san and I have an agreement in writing. Didn't we, Harukichi-san? Yeah. Isn't it possible, if I can't pay for a full child's ticket? Are you still there? Won't you listen to me? No, that's enough. My wife is dead. She was ill for six months. Things wouldn't be so bad, but I had to spend all my money on doctors and medicines. And now... I have nothing left. I think I can find work in Hokkaido so... I'm sorry, but if we give reductions or free rides the railway company can't make a profit. You should know that. Why does he keep interrupting? You must reconsider. You only got 60-70 yen and give her a long, tough working life. Teacher or not, don't be ridiculous. - I paid 250 yen for this girl. - I know. That's the face price. But you deducted various costs, which you claimed. After that the net income is 60-70 yen. Isn't it Harukichi-san? You accepted that, didn't you? Yes, I accepted with disgust. Then don't complain. Dad. Dad, the train is leaving. Impossible, sir? You win. You'll let me have the reduction? No money needed. Take this. Can I? Don't hesitate. Go, go. Thank you, thank you very much, sir. Let's go. Let's go. Wait. I'll keep this. What? Give this to him. I see, I see. Go. - What are you doing? - Let's conclude the business here. Cost for Oshamanbe, one child. OK. I can't help it. This is a good pumpkin. Can I borrow the phone? Please. Hello. I have nothing to say anymore. Just give back the money I gave you. You know I can't. That's ridiculous. Yes. Then I'll come immediately. Sorry as always. No, no. You have done our job. Why not quit teaching and become head against trafficking? Teacher Oogaki? He is devoting himself to his job. Quite admirable. There's budget left for it, I think. Discuss it with him and try to help. Yanagida-kun, show me the last report of the probity check. Danna-san, buy my apples, please. Apples are in season. How much? For you I'll make it 1-yen 18-sen. Oh, that's too much. We might arrest you for excessive profiteering. I know nothing about that. Just taste this. It looks just like a maiden's cheek. So red, see? This year's good. Yes, so good. Does this remind you of your wife's cheeks? That's no good. May I ask you something, sirs. I have something to ask you, sirs. What is it? It's a very complicated story. I don't know where to start. It's about something which happened a long time ago. You can come in and tell us. Thank you very much, sir. Come, come. Mum. You fool. My purse was stolen so we have to tell the police. Come on. Not you. I'll listen to the girl first. Take a seat. I'm sorry, sir. The chair is too much for me. Don't hesitate. Sit. - You're too good to me, sir. - Come on, sit down. No, sir. As you wish. What is it? I want you to search for my daughter. Did she run away from home? She was taken when she was 10 years old. How long ago? Well, I'm not sure. The year we had the big earthquake. Many people died. That year. That's an old story, twelve, thirteen years ago. That's year she was sold to a circus company which came for the festival. Did you sell her? No. The girl's mother. A bad woman called Sugi sold the girl. - Is the girl not your daughter? - No. Sugi didn't care for her own baby, so, I was childless, and badly wanted the child. I was given the new born babe and raised her for 10 years. What have you done with the baby's family registration? Well now, I can't read letters. She was registered, in Sugi's family without my knowledge. I complained a lot, then I found she'd been adopted by the boss of the circus. But you brought her up, nevertheless. I tried to think it was my fate, so I gave up. But, this spring a medicine peddler from Toyama, told me that, he met a girl working as a maid at an inn called Seifukan in this town. What's wrong? I've had a stomach ache since this morning. Rest a little. Hey, the thief is your daughter. What? She did it? I thought it was strange! You, shame on you! How much money was in the stolen purse? 2-yen 50-sen. It's untouched, still all there. Is it? Thank you, thank you, sir. Wait. You are family. What does it mean stealing or stolen between you? You should be ashamed! To do such thing! You are the problem. Don't drive out your daughter's husband anymore. Did you tell such a thing? But, mum. How many of your daughter's husbands did you kick out? Hey, what number was the last one? Tell. The fifth, sir. Fifth? Why did you drive off your daughter's husbands? If you are going to do it again, we can't free your daughter. Stealing from home isn't serious, but stealing somewhere else is a big problem. If she set a fire, for example, what would that be? You don't know the story of Yaoya Oshichi? You won't drive off her husband, OK? Hey, take her to jail. Mom! I see, I see, please, I won't do it again. Good. You want to live with the last man who was kicked out? Do you want him? - Will you call him back for her? - I will, sir. It shouldn't be an empty promise. I know you are a widow, but you shouldn't kick your daughter's husband out so often. Don't be jealous of young people. As you say, I'll call my daughter's husband. Yes, do it. No cheating. Good. She promised. Don't cry in front of people. You can go. Don't cry. Thank you, sir. Thank you, gentlemen. Say thank you. Behave yourselves. Why'd the daughter steal the purse? Stupid, really. She wanted to warn her mother that the house isn't safe without a man. You revealed the daughter's trick. As a result of your teaching the daughter can live with her husband again. All's well that ends well. If you are in pain you'd better lie down on a tatami mat. I'll listen to you later. Let her rest in the night duty room. Granny, let's go. I'm sorry. Hey there. Let her rest in here. I'm sorry, sir. Hey, the evidence of the theft has laid an egg. What shall we do? Laid an egg? Let me see. It's still warm. What shall we do? Wait for the next one. Is Ueda Aya here? An unlicensed midwife? Yes sir. We kept her waiting. Call her. Come out! Yajima. How is the self-styled priest at Toranokuzu doing? He's self-important and has started an extremely ridiculous treatment these days. We should arrest him, maybe tomorrow. It's the right time. We've gathered the evidence now. Have a seat there. Here, sir? Sit down there. May I ask what you want me for? How many births have you assisted in so far? Well, I haven't counted, sir. So many? I have many children, so know childbirth well. So the neighbourhood people keep asking me to help. Nowadays people say they can't do without me. I see. - What are you writing, sir? - Never mind. I'll wait here. No, you must come and be present. I don't want to. Why not, sir? I don't like the police. I don't care about five or ten yen anymore. That's my limit. You can pay back 50-yen, that's all. You must pay 50-yen at minimum. I see. Let's go. How much did they reward you for that? Most of all gave me no money at all. They say something like "I'll give you something after a good harvest, "or let me work for you”. If they give me a pack of miso or rice, that's the limit. It's not given. Rather I have to give some bleached cotton cloth or something. Do you? You must think again carefully. The teacher says he has found a good workplace for her. But selling her for indentured servitude? You should know if it's good or bad. Think again. I knew it's not good. However, my debts were piling up so high. In addition, my children are born like rabbits. At the end of last year my eighth child was born. How old are you? 37, sir. And with eight children? Is that true? It's true, he has eight, including twins. Starting with the girl there, I assisted in all of them. I can assure you. I see, twins. It was hard for me. - Sir, the birth of twins is... - Enough, don't interrupt. I'm sorry to put you to all that trouble without any reward. You're welcome. Sit down. It's said that you are acting as doctor as well as midwife. Not like a doctor, but I do a little. Yes, I see. Leave it as it is. Keep her. What you have spent is gone. 30-yen from the police support fund against human trafficking. 20-yen from the teacher. Settle with the 50-yen. Abandon these wrong ideas of selling your daughter. You see? Thank you very much for everything, sir. Thank him. Good, good for her. We'll leave before you. Thank you very much, sir. No, we thank you every time. Let's go. Where are we going? Wait in that room. Should I wait there again? I want to sit on the tatami mat. Don't you understand your situation? - What you are doing is a sin. - A sin? Yes, a crime. I helped people. How could it be a sin? That's no use. You've violated the Medical Practitioner's Law. - What? - Come on. That's so unreasonable! Alright, just come on. Is it true what you said at the police station? What? You embarrassed your parent. Who would do such a thing? What? You won't ask Nao-san to return? Who would ask? Where are you going? I'll go to the police again. No kidding, it was a lie. It was a lie. Then when will you call him back? You are using the police. I'll call him whenever you like. Is it true? Yes, it's true. - Mum. - What? I know. Granny. Does it still hurt? I still have a pain. That's too bad. To the people who always eat white rice, this might be rare. Please try to eat this millet ball. No, no. Why don't you try to eat this flatfish. No sir, it's too good for me. Granny. Why don't you continue your story? The Toyama medicine peddler told me that a maid working at Seifukan was looking for her foster parent. After hearing the peddler's story, I was convinced it was my girl. I was really moved, learning that she was looking for the likes of me. I wanted to come here immediately, but it's so far away and my health isn't so good. Seifukan was bankrupted. Yes, yes, it's empty now. Have you been there? Yes, sir. Maybe I can't expect her at my death bed. But I wanted to see her at least once before I die. Granny. What's wrong? Hurting again? Because of my age... I am easily moved to tears. I'll look for her. Tell me your address and the name of the girl. I asked someone to write it here. Kurozawa village, that's remote. How did you get here? By horse cart? - On foot, sir. - Did you really? Matsubaya Kin. Is that you? Yes, sir. The girl is Yoshie. What is her surname? I don't know. Since she was adopted by the circus, I don't know her surname anymore. I see, alright. Sir, please search for her when you have time. I'll start checking the whereabouts of Seifukan's owner. Please, sir. Why don't you stay at a cheap inn and go back tomorrow morning? An inn is too much for me. Then you can stay here for tonight. No. I've given you a lot of trouble already. I'll be punished if I give any more. No, no punishment at all. But coming to this town and having a free stay, I shouldn't accept it. I'll leave now, sir. I see. Thank you, sir. Granny. Take care. Triangular strategy of shogi (Japanese chess), very good. - Let's play. - Teach me. OK, I'll give you a kaku (bishop) advantage. Sit down. What is it? Stealing chickens again. Again? Sit down. Have a seat here. You've only arrested me, that's not fair. What? You had an accomplice? No, mate. I want you arrest the man who stole my wife. What? Your wife was stolen? Yes, sir. Your wife was stolen while you were stealing chickens. No, that's not it, sir. Whilst I was away from home for three months a construction worker came into my house and stayed. Where were you those three months? Here... there... Loitering. Here and there? Where? I avoided people and slept in the mountains or a temple hut. I went to Tsugaru where I worked on a construction site. Because you were scared of being arrested for stealing. Isn't that so? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. If you think you are wrong, you must confess honestly. Why did you start to steal? I wanted to cure my wife's disease, but, I had no money. I stole three chickens from someone. But no one noticed. I stole two from a house and three from another house. - Every day. - It became your business. - I'm sorry. - Continue. How many did you steal? 50? 100? Maybe more than 100 or 200. So many? I had sinned already so I made up my mind to continue until my wife was well again. So, your wife is cured. I thought she would be fine by now and came back secretly. I was thinking to run away with my wife. I entered my house. My wife said: I was away from home without telling her. She thought I abandoned her because I hated a sick woman. She misunderstood me so. So, she started to live with another man? So... The woman was written in your family register? I thought I'd register her into my family after having a child, but not yet, sir. I see. Where is the key? In the desk, sir. Anyway, your wife is an impatient, wanton woman. A bad woman. No, she's not such a woman. She is too good to me. If she was, she could have waited for years. But, she can't make a living. And she can't work due to her illness. That guy took advantage of her with sweet words. That woman isn't wrong. That workman is a thief too. Put him in jail as well. - We can't. - Why not? Because she wasn't written in your family register. It's not illegal. No way! Go in. What? This is a jail. Go in and calm down. This is better than sleeping on the mountain. No, no way! Why just me? In poor shogi play, hisha (rook) is valued more than the king. Oh, no. Wait, sir. A drunkard. You don't know me. I'm not that kind of shakuhachi player. Has he drunk unrefined sake or something? A hopeless case. I am a fine artist. He drank with the money for his baby's funeral. His baby died? Yes, someone pitied him and gave him a 10-yen note for the funeral. This guy hasn't seen a 10-yen note in years. He was so excited and started to drink. I was a good master once. Had 50 or 60 pupils. I can play one for you. OK, OK. Hey, give me a hand. Oh, God. Can I help you? No need. Go in. This is a chase and a half. Is there a person in charge of sanitation? What is it, sir? Infectious disease. Dysentery. Dysentery? Where, sir? At Toranokuzu, the place with the fake priest. That fake priest? We are planning on arresting him today. He gave the patients powder from a strange tree root. Disgusting. But the case I examined this morning was too tough for the fake priest. He knew it and didn't want the patient to die at his place, so he called me in, a real doctor, though he's never respected me. Where did the patient come from? They say the patient visited the police yesterday, after that she collapsed. What? Visited here? Yes, let me see... Well, oh yes, an old lady from Kurozawa village. Is it? What a shame. The old woman. I see now. She complained of stomach pains. Why don't you take one? Thanks. Doesn't have dysentery does it? No kidding. I heard sick people visited the fake priest, as many as 100 per day. One hundred? That's why business at my Yokota clinic is so slow. Those people would rather save money than save their lives. They go to the fake priest because they have no money. Yes, the poor people can afford neither doctors nor geishas. Hey, I might be a quack doctor, but don't confuse doctors with geishas. Will you buy a bird? What is it? A bird for eating? Or for singing? A nightingale, sir. A nightingale? Yes, this is a nightingale. Does it sing? I wouldn't sell a nightingale which doesn't sing. Hey, sing, sing. No, sir. You scared it. It's too scared to sing. Alright. If it won't sing, I'll wait till it does, little cuckoo, no, nightingale. Please buy. No, not at all. A nightingale which doesn't sing is nothing. Isn't it? Yes, that's right. Oh, what shall I do? I wish it would sing. You're late today. Yes, I visited the prefectural office yesterday and returned this morning. Call Ueda Yae. It's singing! It's in good voice. It is a nightingale. Please buy this. Give it me for 1-yen 50-sen. Is that all? This is a good bird. Give it me. When did you catch it? Yesterday, sir. - You caught it? - Yes, sir. - Yesterday? - Yes, sir. Let it out. What? I couldn't do such a stupid thing. I have to sell this to buy rice. My children are waiting with open mouths, just like swallows. But this is a forbidden bird. What? What does that mean? If you catch the bird you will be fined. Well I never. Kobayashi, free the bird. You came to the wrong place. Because there's no other place round here where the people have money. It's the law. Let it out. I didn't know. Singing again. Miyoshi, check the woman's living conditions. If the conditions are too bad, contact the expert. I see, sir. Can't you do something? No, we can't. Impossible? It sings so beautifully. Goodbye. Hey, your cage. I don't accept that I committed a crime. But it can't be helped. And you gave some medicines to the women in childbirth. I gave them some medicines before and after childbirth. Is this also a crime? Yes. That's ridiculous. I'll never assist anyone anymore, even if asked. How much did you get from it? As I told you yesterday. Tell me again. No reward, on the contrary, I use my own money. In the empty inn at Seifukan, this woman was suffering. Dysentery? No sir, labour pains. - What? Labour pains? - Do something please. No, I won't. Bring her to the holding room. Call Dr. Yokota back. Not a doctor, but a midwife, sir. - I must do it after all. - No, you mustn't. Hurry, please. Call the midwife who's designated by the prefecture. Hello, hello. We need a midwife. It's same as my wife's childbirth. What? She's out? Gone to the next village? Oh, God. Hello, can't you do something? You can't? What's to be done? No? Can't you do something? She's the only one, that's the problem. Hurry, hurry. She's in great pain. That's why we always say we need two. Call again. I can't sit and watch any more. Childbirth is a woman's job. Hey, you can't. Get out! This is not for men to watch. Call the drunken shakuhachi player. What are you doing? Boil some water. It's any time now. And buy bleached cotton and absorbent cotton. The police will provide the money. Hurry! Hey, tell me again. And bring oiled paper and an eye dropper from my home. Do you understand? What? Go to my house and get oiled paper and an eye dropper. - Do you understand? - Yes. In this kind of situation, men are totally useless. What's that. What a racket. Childbirth, sir. Childbirth? That's good. I can name the baby. Oiled paper and an eye dropper. ...and bleached cotton. Hey, take that out. What, sir? Oh, there you are. Catch it. Has the water boiled? Yes, here. A washtub! Stop drinking. Drinking has turned you into a beggar-like figure. You said that you were a good master once. You must know your own heart better than someone's preaching. Sake is your Poverty God. Think again and come back to your human-like life. Try to realise that this last drinking was caused by your dead baby. From now on you must definitely stop drinking. Yes, sir. Through that, your baby, which lost its funeral money through your drinking can rest in peace. Born! Was your baby a boy or a girl? I was wrong, sir. Boy or girl? What, sir? We've not been told yet, sir. All right. It's not urgent. My shakuhachi... Yes, my shakuhachi... We haven't seen it. You were drunk and forgot it somewhere. Don't come back here like this again. OK? Hey, your business tool. Thank you, sir. You made a fuss last night. You said you were a fine artist. If you want to apologize, play. Good. You've done it. You don't have any acquaintances in this town? I was working at a place, but I found it empty when I visited. Where is it? Seifukan. What is your name? Kinoshita Yoshie. Yoshie. Really? I know someone who is looking for you. It's not true. Who would care for me? The old woman who raised you. What? Mum? Don't move. You must lie down quietly. Don't frighten her. I see. The old lady I saw at the station... was it her? Where is she? Don't worry. She's in the charity hospital. Hospital? Then I can't see her. Will you take care of this woman? All right, all right. A fine shakuhachi. So good. Do you want me, sir? You are listening for free. This is the cost for all of you. Give this to the shakuhachi player. Where are you going, sir? To the charity hospital.
