Journal entry, February 19th. I'm Lieutenant Daniel McKay. The war between us and the Yankees has been going on for four years. We have engaged the enemy in battle at Pleasant Hill. Both sides have lost a lot of men. Though we have hoped for victory, we are realizing how futile this war has been. Everyone who dies is an American. General Quantrell ordered me and my squad of 12 men to go behind the Yankee lines to disrupt their supplies and seize a gold shipment. They hit us hard. We got the gold, but only me and Sergeant Hanson got away. - Freeze. - Hold it. Right there, little lady. - Well. - Damn, it's you. - Who is you? - English major. Becky. Becky Midnite. - So, Chris Cannon, I never thought I'd see you again. - Chris, you know this lady? - Know her? Hell, I trained her in the academy in Virginia four years ago. By the looks of it, I did a pretty good job. Becky Midnite, Mark Austin. - It's a pleasure. Didn't Chris ever tell you about me? I, uh, thought we were an item. - Chris, maybe I should leave you two alone. - No, no, look, that's enough reminiscing, all right. We've got business to take care of. - In your last report to headquarters, you said that things were getting pretty hot down here. The agency said they'd send you in some backup. - Yes, but I didn't know who or when. - Well, I guess you know now. - All right, as long as you're here, Mark and I were just about to go on a very important bust. Do you have your stuff? - Give me a couple of minutes, and I'll be dressed to kill. - Chris, who the hell is she? - Just an old friend, a terrific lady. She's obviously one hell of an agent. Speak in the microphone. - Did she just plant that on me? - Nice work, Becky. Becky, are you familiar with this crossbow? It's the latest in silent assault weapons technology. The tip of this arrow explodes three seconds after penetration. - Reminds me of an old boyfriend. - Look, this is serious business. This isn't some sort of training exercise. - Yes, sir. - I've got a plan. - Radio check. - I copy. - Let's move out. - Roger that. Slash, what the hell's wrong with you? - Get up, man, what's wrong? - You like that, huh? How about this, huh? You got a lot to learn. What about a knife? Oh, yeah. - We still got it, Rip. - All right, good job. - We got work to do. - Not bad. - You know that? - Let's do it. - Come on. - Okay. You get my gear. Kid, get me a beer. - Okay, I see them, and I'm going in. - Roger that. - Hey, lady, can't you read? No trespassing. - Sorry, boys. I was just out for a little drive and somehow I got lost. - Darling, this is private property. You ain't got no business being out here. - Awfully hot out here. - Why don't you go get the nice lady some ice water. - Oh, why you always telling me what to do? - Just go get the water. - You better be nice to me, or I'm gonna tell Uncle Jesse what you did to that chicken last night. - Go get the water now. Don't mind him. His parents is cousins. - Chris. - Yes. - Bingo. - Let's take 'em in. - Let's go. - What are y'all doing out here with those big guns? - Oh, just a little squirrel huntin'. - Squirrel huntin', huh? - Mm-hmm. - You boys are out of business. I'm Agent Cannon. I've got your cannon. - Becky, duck! Chris! - Nice shot, partner. Becky, you okay? I'm fine. There go the other two. - Come on, let's get 'em. - No, no, wait. - Dammit, they're gonna get away. - Gotta stop thinking of me as just another pretty face. - Let's go, Mark. Come on, get up! - On your stomach, on your stomach. - Get up. Put your hands behind your head. - Up, come on, get up, let's go, let's go. Get up. - Right there, right there. - Get up, get up, get outta here. Let's go, move it, move it. - Nice shot, Robin Hood. Let's go, move it. - All in a day's work. - Don't look now, but here comes to trouble. Get down, get down. Okay. - Just what in the hell is going on here? This place looks like a war zone. - Look, we're just trying to do our job. - There's nothing in the agency's regulation that says you can walk onto private property without a warrant and reenact Desert Storm. You're not supposed to make a move unless you check with me first. - We take our orders directly from Washington command. - We take our orders from Special Agent Noble. - I should have known the famous Agent Noble was behind this. You can bet that's gonna go into my report. What's the official body count? - Two dead. - By the way, just who in the hell are you? - Special Agent Becky Midnite from the Washington division, sir. - Well, Miss Midnite, are you familiar at all with the agency's regulation regarding reassignment? The reassigned agent must check in with the head of that particular division. And the head of that particular division just happens to be me. The two of you guys are through with this agency. I'm gonna show that Agent Noble just who runs the show down here. We'll take over from here. - Get up. - Have a real nice day. What a first day. - You said it. - That Dickson's a real son of a bitch. What's his story? - We've had to put up with his crap ever since he took over this division. - This used to be Agent Noble's beat. The bust today was a part of Noble's unfinished business. Dickson hates us because we really never recognized him as division head. - He ticks me off. - Our loyalty is still with Agent Noble. I guess we better check in with our real boss. - Agent Noble here. Ava, it's The Three Musketeers checking in. - I was just gonna call you. - I just wanted to let you know how things went this morning. - Don't bother, I already know. Dickson has filed a report with the chief of internal affairs. I've been called into headquarters to review the charges against you. - How does it look? - Not good. Dickson's really caused problems for us this time. I'll call you as soon as I'm out of the meeting. Okay. - Okay, that's enough for now. Go get cleaned up. I was wondering when you were gonna have the courage to show up here. Someone knocked over my watermelon stand this morning. I lost over a hundred kilos of the world's finest cocaine. I also lost four of my best men. Do you happen to know anything about this? - Sorry about that, couldn't be helped. - Couldn't be helped? - I didn't know about the bust until it was too late. - That shipment had a street value of over $20 million. I wonder what your street value is, Dickson. Right now, I wouldn't waste a bullet on you. - Why don't you quit your bitching. Things don't always go as planned. Just deal with it, man. - Deal with it, huh? You're a real tough talker, Dickson. I hope you don't forget who you're playing with. - Oh, I know exactly who I'm playing with. Some two-bit Bolivian drug dealer, thinks he's Al Capone. - Well, if it wasn't for this stupid Bolivian drug dealer, you wouldn't be where you are now. If you remember correctly, it was me who gave you the tips on my competition. Without me, you would have never made all those busts. And you would have never gotten all those nice agency promotions. Let's face it, I made you. - Maybe. Mm, but if it wasn't for my protection, you'd been busted long ago. You'd be rottin' in some federal prison. - Let me give you a piece of advice, Dickson. Never overestimate your importance to me and my organization, that would be foolish. - And you should never overestimate my tolerance of you. That would be bad for your health. I never grow tired of your witty repartee. - I'm working on gettin' your two man out of jail. - What about those three agents who were the cause of all this? - I filed a report against 'em with Washington. They won't bother for a while. The least they will get is a suspension. - The very least I want is them dead. - This is the best I can do for you now. This is a communication device used by the agency. It will allow you to monitor all the agents' conversations. At least you'll know what they're up to. - That's more than I have been able to say about you. - I'll keep in touch. - I hope things start going my way. Really hate that guy. Where are the girls? - They're in the shower, Santiago. - What's up? I am. - Well, all right. - All right. Yeah. - Agent Noble, I'm sorry, but after going over this initial report filed by Agent Dickson, I have no choice. I am approving the temporary suspension of your team. This goes into effect immediately. The suspension will remain in effect pending further investigation into this matter. Are there any questions? - No, sir. - Good, then I will leave it up to you to notify the three agents. Have a good day, Agent Noble. - Becky. You look great. - Ready to check out that Dallas nightlife I've heard so much about. - I know the perfect place. There's a small little restaurant right on the edge of town. Hello. - Chris, it's Ava. I'm afraid I've got some bad news. Dickson's done it. You three are on temporary suspension. - Damn. For how long, Ava? - Least until an investigation takes place. How long could that take? Anywhere from two weeks to two months. - That Dickson has really screwed us this time. - If I can talk to the right people, you could be back on as soon as next week. - So what do we do until then? - Well, I do think it's a good idea for you to stay outta Dickson's way for the time being. Why don't you take some sort of vacation. Go camping. - Camping? - You know, it has been a long time since we've gotten away from it all. - Could take dirt bikes and head out through Big Pines Forest. - Yeah, that sounds like a pretty good idea. - You can count me out. The woods are nice and all, but camping is not my cup of tea. - Call me tomorrow and let me know your plans. Okay, Ava, talk to you later. Let's get going. Good evening, how are you? - Becky, you'll love it. This will give you a chance to see the surrounding area. - I can't believe you two are trying to talk me into this camping expedition. It'll be fun. Chris and I used to do this when we were kids. - We would go in search of Quantrell's gold. - What is Quantrell's gold? - Quantrell was a Confederate general during the Civil War. Legend has it that some of his men buried a large amount of stolen gold in the woods not too far from here. - We would look for it every summer. - You two, a regular Torn Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. Well, did you ever find that treasure? - No, I'm convinced it was just a legend. There is no gold in those woods. - I know this sounds crazy, But I think they're playing our song. - Would you like to dance, Becky? I would love to. - Becky, you know when that light came on today and I saw that it was you, I had this sudden flood of emotions. - I know, I felt the same way. - I just hope we can put our emotions aside and concentrate on our mission. - We're both professionals, I think we can handle it. - I had a bad problem with the police. Look, I'm setting up a second shipment. Just tell your people they'll have their money in two weeks. - We better get our money back. - Yeah, I think so. - Where's Santiago? - He's upstairs. - We came as soon as we got outta jail. - Bandages? You weren't hurt too badly, were you? - I'm all right, I just sprained my wrist is all. - I had four well-armed men out there, and you could not stop three little agents. Hell, one of them was a woman. - They took us by surprise. They really knew what they were doing. Now that we're out, we'll make it up to you. We'll kill those three agents. - No. This is gonna call for an expert in such matters. I have an acquaintance out of Houston who will be arriving here tonight. You boys will be able to watch a real professional in action. - Hey, baby, baby, it's really crowded in there. Why don't you let me clear you off some place to sit, right here on my face. Come on. - Why, is your nose bigger than your dick? - Whoa. - Come in. Jewel Panther. You are as beautiful as you are deadly. - Santiago, it's been a long time. I've missed your charm. - Is that all you've missed? - Don't flatter yourself, you're not that good. I see you haven't lost your sense of humor. - I hope you didn't bring me all the way here just to hear my latest jokes. - Of course not. I have a problem with the law. There are these three agents who have disrupted my business. I don't want to be bothered by them ever again. Do you catch my meaning? - Loud and clear. I take a great deal of pride in my work, and those agents won't be a problem for you any longer. - Hail, hail, the gang's all here. My dear Dickson, mighty brave of you showing up here during business hours. - I came in the back way. Who's this? - Just an associate. She is here to advise us on our problem with your three little friends. - What do you mean by advise? She here to kill them? - Dickson, just what kind of people do you think we are? - Santiago, have you thought about what would happen if you killed three of the agency's men? This place'd be crawling with investigators. It would make life miserable for all of us. And trust me, you wouldn't want to make me miserable. - Again with the tough talk. I swear, I think you've been reading too many detective novels. - Listen, you grease ball, I'm more than prepared to back up my tough talk. I'm suffering from a bad case of PMS. I wouldn't try my patience if I were you. - You're the kind of woman my mother warned me about. - As far as the agents are concerned, you just leave it up to me. I'm looking out for everyone's interests. - Hm, with a face like that, how could I not trust you? - Any information you have on them would be very helpful. - I gave you the communication device. If you used it, the agents are bound to check in with Washington. You should know all their plans. - You are so helpful. - Well, I'd better go before someone sees me. Mm, I hope we meet again. I'll keep in touch. - Dickson, by the way, if you ever point a gun at me, I will take it from you and shove it up your ass sideways. That's a promise. - Bang, bang. - What's his story? - Just an agent on the payroll. He's beginning to outlive his usefulness. - I can see why. - Now let's talk business. - Becky, what the hell is this? - Just a little protection, you two brought guns. - Well, just a couple of small pistols in case we see a snake or something. - Well, what if we run into a bear or something? There are no bears in these woods. - Well, if there are, I intend to be ready for them. Okay, you guys strap down the bags. I better check in with Ava before we head out. This is Special Agent Chris Cannon. Can you put me through to Washington please? - This is Agent Noble. Ava, it's Chris. Where are you? - We're taking your advice. - Well, I'm glad to hear it. - Slash, go get Santiago, I think we've got 'em. - We're heading out through Big Pines Forest, and we'll probably follow the Red River until we get to Turner's Woods. - Sounds like a plan. - Okay, we'll keep in touch with the communicator. - I have a meeting with the chief later today. Hopefully I'll have some good news next time we talk. - Great, we'll contact you this afternoon. - Be careful. - Perfect, this is the perfect opportunity to take care of those meddling agents. They will be out in the middle of nowhere. - And when we find them, we can hunt them down like small animals, and no one will be able to hear their cries of pain and despair. This is gonna be fun. - I like your style. - You should. - I cannot believe how beautiful it is out here. - Didn't we tell ya? - It hasn't changed a bit. Looks just like it did when we were kids. - It's so peaceful. You know, after all the crime we face in our jobs, it's like nothing bad could ever happen to you out here. It's nice to get away. - Now, the plan is for you two to scout for them in the chopper. Jewel and I will take the back roads in the four wheel drive. - Yes, sir. - We will stay in touch with the radios. If you spot them, call me. Don't try to capture them yourselves. They will only kill you. All right? Let's go. - Party time. - I could really get used to the great outdoors. There's only one thing missing, though. - What's that? - Well, where's the ladies room? - Pick a bush, any bush. - Great, I'll be back. - Watch out for those bears. - Very funny. Careful back in the woods, Becky, you might run into a bear. - What? What's wrong? - I'm okay, I was just startled. - By what? - Under the log. - Well, that's enough to startle anyone. - What's this? Looks like there's something wrapped up in an oilcloth. Some sort of a diary. - Do you see any dates? - The last entry is dated February 20, 1865. - Can you make out anything else? - There's a little map drawn next to the last entered date. - What does the entry say? - Something about a robbery, burying something, and-- What, what does it say? You guys aren't gonna believe this, but I think we just found the treasure map to Quantrell's gold. - I don't know how much longer we can take this road. - From this map, looks like we'd make better time by river. We need a boat. - This is Santiago, come in. - Go ahead. - Any sign of them? - Nothing yet, just a lotta woods. - Well, keep looking. Also, keep your eyes out for a boat. This four-wheel drive is not cutting it. - Roger that. - When do we start searching for the treasure? - I don't know, it's gonna be dark soon. We need to find a place to camp. - If I remember correctly, there should be a hunter's lodge not too far from here. I don't know what kind of shape it's in, but it's worth a look. - Great, let's check it out. I'm gonna check in with Ava before we head out. Ava, it's Chris. - Yes, Chris. - Found the treasure map to Quantrell's gold. - Quantrell's gold. So the plot thickens. - We're gonna head out tomorrow and look for it. - Anyway, I'm gonna be heading down there later tonight. I'm gonna try to straighten out that mess with Dickson. Santiago, come in. Great, thanks-- - Go ahead. - We've found you a boat. This is turning out to be my day. There's only one problem. It belongs to a couple of park rangers. - I wonder if we could persuade them to let us borrow it. - You didn't bring me along for just my good looks. You wait right here. You can learn a lot from me. - Check this out. Howdy, ma'am. What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this? - I'm just out for a hike. - Don't look like no hiker we ever saw. - This is a nice boat. Thanks. I'll get the rest of the stuff. - Sure looks fast. - Yes, ma'am, this is the fastest boat on the river. - How 'bout that? Here let me give you a hand with that. - Thanks. - Jesus, lady, what's wrong with you? What are you crazy or something? What the hell do you want? - You certainly have a flare for this line of work. - Thank you. - Well, it's not the Ritz, but uh, least we have a roof over our head. - Yeah, this'll be perfect. - So is there any chance this place has a bathroom? - Sure does, even has a shower. - Aren't I the lucky girl. - Look! - Could that be them? - Look down at that clearing. It's got to be. We better radio Santiago. Santiago, come in. - Go ahead. - I think we found the agents. - Excellent, where are they? - They're in an old lodge about a mile into the woods where the river forks. - Perfect. Put the chopper down at the river. You and Slash make your way to the cabin and watch them for the night. In the morning, we'll meet at the chopper, and together the four of us will take care of those agents once and for all, you read me? - Roger that. - And then we will collect the gold. - It'll be like taking candy from a baby. - Let's take a closer look at this diary. - Why don't you start at the last entry? - Okay, February 20, 1865. "It has been two days since we raided the Yankee train "with the shipment of gold bullion "the brave army of Confederacy needs so desperately. "Sergeant Hanson took a mini ball in his stomach "during the raid. "He is slowing us down. "He is hurt real bad. "I don't think that he can make it much longer. "We took off all of the bullion our horses could carry. "Now the horses are plumb give out and getting lame. "It has been two days since the horses or us "have had any food. "We have camped in a Cottonwood thicket "about a day's ride north of the Red River. "We have seen signs of Indians at every turn. "We do not know what tribes or whether or not "they are hostile. "We may have to bury the gold and make a run for it." Wow, that's some story. - Now all we have to do is find the tree with a knife in it. - Well, we should get some sleep and head out first thing in the morning. - Yeah. - Hey, you know how we can get back in good standing with Santiago? - How's that? - When we meet up with him in the morning, if the agents are already dead, we can show him that we don't need some flashy bitch to come in and do our dirty work. - I don't know. I don't know if the two of us can handle those three. Don't worry, I have a plan. - You boys start on breakfast, I'm gonna go take a shower. - Robin Hood, you might need this. - Here's our chance. Where's she going? - Chris, let's go! - Cover yourself, we're going after him. - Okay - Damn, what a way to go. - What a freak thing for this branch to be here like that. - Yeah, this is some old tree. Look! Up in the tree. - That's the marking the diary was talking about. Quantrell's gold is right here. - Yeah, and this poor sap helped us find it. - You know, this guy looks familiar. - Hey, this is one of the guys from the drug bust the other day. - So what's he doing out here? - Wait a minute, he had a partner. - Becky, let's go. - Hello, agent lady. Remember me? I'm still here. Don't worry, I just need a minute to reload. Hell, this is gonna be fun. Almost as much fun as you trying to blow me away with that little crossbow. You remember that crossbow? - You mean this one? Yes. - Those idiots, they can never follow orders. - I knew those two would screw things up. We'd better get over there. - Are you okay? - What happened? - Finally ran into that bear. - Wait a minute, miss, you can't go in there, miss. - What the hell you doing here? - I'm here to find out why you're busting the chops of your fellow agents. I don't know what you're talkin' about. - You don't, huh? Well, what about having my three agents suspended for doing their job? - Those agents had it coming. They have a real problem with authority, and it seems you do as well. - This is Agent Noble. - Ava, this is Chris. A couple of thugs from the drug bust just tried to kill us. - What? You heard me. I think we've also stumbled upon the lost gold. - What gold? - Shh. You better get out here. - Where are you? - Well, we're about 15 miles into Turner's Woods, just north of where the Red River forks. - I'm on my way. - Agent Noble, what's going on? - My team may be in trouble, they need me. But don't worry, I'll be back to deal with you later. - When I get my hands on those two idiots of mine, if they're not already dead, I'll kill them myself. - Look what I found. - That's perfect. Let's go for the gold. - What are you doing here, Dickson? - This is my jurisdiction. - There's no way in hell you're coming with me. - If those agents are in trouble, it's my business. - This is no time for a pissing contest, just get in. - Look. Here are their dirt bike tracks. We follow these, they'll lead us right to the agents. - And possibly to the gold. This is going to be sweet. - Don't spend that gold yet. Evidently your two boys have already encountered the agents, and we've lost the element of surprise. - I don't need the element of surprise, I have you. - It's a real shame we only brought two shovels. - Yeah, that's it. - Well, this is it. - Go ahead, open it, the suspense is killing me. - This is all we dreamed of as kids! - Yes! There. - My, my, my, it's a regular party out here. - I wouldn't do that if I were you. - Trust me, boys, don't test her patience. And the other one? Some people just can't listen, oh, well. This is something else you three will have to pay for. - Who the hell are you? - I'm the owner of the watermelon stand you three busted up. Oh, you have caused me a lot of problems. Now you must pay with your lives. Mm, look at all that pretty gold. Some days, it doesn't pay to get up in the mornings. Luckily for me, this is not one of those days. What the hell kinda toy is that? - It's the latest in silent assault weapons technology. These arrows explode within three seconds of contact. - Uh-huh. - Oh, I've taken some off a few dead agents lately. - You kill federal agents often do you? - Eh, it's a living. - You get off on it or somethin'? - Enough of the small talk. We'll let the three of them carry the gold back to the boat. After that, you can take care of the business. - With pleasure. - If you will be so kind as to carry the gold. Move! - You, get the shovels. We're gonna need 'em. - Move! Let's go. I wonder who that belongs to. Maybe we should check it out. No. Why not? - You never know what we might be walking into. Let's take our boat down river and backtrack by land. - All right, I'll go along with that. - End of the line, boys. You can put it down for now. - Now for the fun part. - What do you think? Should we bury them or just throw their bodies in the river? - Well, that's a tough decision. I like to exercise my creativity when disposing of bodies. - Don't even think about it. I just love a good cat fight. Those martial arts skills very impressive, but let's not forget who has the gun. - And I suggest you drop that gun before I drop you. - Ava. - Not a moment too soon. - Who do we have here? Agents are coming out of the woodwork. - I said drop it. - Dickson, it was funny at first, but the joke is beginning to wear thin. - I'm afraid it's you who better drop it. - Dickson, you slime. - Well, this certainly explains a lot. - Yeah, old Dickson's been playing for the other team. - Yes, Dickson and I go way back. He's been a great help to my organization. - So, what do we do with them now? - Kill them, of course. - Would you like the honors? - Killing agents is not my style. - Don't have the stomach for it, huh? - I have no great love for those four. You do what you want with them, just don't involve me. - What brought you out here anyways? - I'm glad you asked that, mi amigo. I just happened to hear a little something about lost gold. Oh, you heard about the gold, did you? - You weren't thinking of keeping it a secret from me, were you? - Dickson, as good of friends as we are? Yeah, right. - I promise you'll get what you deserve. - I better. - Dickson, you're a real fool. The only thing he plans on giving you is a bullet in the head, think about it. - She's right, Dickson. To kill four of the agency's men and get away with it? There can be no loose ends. You're the one loose end they can't afford to have. - Besides, with you out of the way, there's more gold for him. - Shut up or I will kill all of you right now. - What about this, Santiago? You weren't planning to double cross me? - Dickson, don't you see what they're trying to do? You are not gonna fall for that old bit are you? - You know what'd happen if you tried to screw me? - Don't threaten me, Dickson, I won't put up with it. - I'll blow your stinkin' greasy head right off. - Don't push it. - Now that you have the Amazon with you, maybe you think you don't need me around anymore. - Well, now that you mention it, you have become quite a pain in the ass lately. - What are we doing? Santiago, we're old friends. We're acting crazy. - Yeah, we're acting crazy. - We just need to lighten up. Oh! Mark, catch. - Let's get out of here. - We gotta make it to the chopper. - Makin' a run for it. - Let's get 'em. - Get in, I'm taking off. Hurry up, get in! - Quick, land the chopper! Land the chopper! - All right, Ava. - Nice shot. - I'm impressed. - Not bad for an agency desk jockey, huh? Thanks for letting me use your shower. - It's the least I could do for the woman who saved my life today. Where are Chris and Becky? - They went out to pick up dinner. This gives you a chance to update me on any new agency procedures. - Well, I have been meaning to engage you in some special training. - So what's the agency going to do with all the gold? - Hopefully they'll give us a raise. Not likely. No, the commander was telling Ava they'll probably put in a Civil War museum. - Yes, I understand, thank you. Well, I just got word from headquarters. They've already assigned Dickson's replacement. - Great, it's probably another hard ass. - Yeah, a real ball breaker. - He'll probably make Dickson look like a saint. Yeah, so Ava, do we have any idea who this new stuffed shirt's gonna be? - As a matter of fact, I'm gonna be stuffing that shirt. And there's gonna be some big changes around here. You guys have become soft and weak. I mean, what you need is some special training from someone who really knows how to crack the whip. - I'll drink to that. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers.
