That was good. Thank you very much. Thank you. Good evening, Mr Yamamoto. How's your father? You two live under the same roof, right? Sometimes I wish I were a bowl of Ramen. At least that way, he'd show more interest in me. It's been hard on you all these years. You know what he's like. I'm used to it. Oh, yeah. Your Aunt Riko wants you over for dinner. Uncle, I'm no longer the same boy who used to live with you. It's rather embarrassing. Embarrassing? Riko treats you like her firstborn! We weren't even married yet when you first arrived in Japan. I remember the wedding. You were so nervous, weren't you? In a nutshell, I'm really a failure! I was always jealous of you. You were better at everything. When you left home to work at a Kaiseki restaurant, I was furious. How many Ramen cooks get to cook Kaiseki? Today's the anniversary of her death, isn't it? Miki's Gourmet Journey Exploring Singapore through its food If there is a dish I would recommend to any Japanese person visiting tropical and humid Singapore, it's Chilli Crab. This is a dish Singaporeans can truly claim as their own. It was created in the 1950s. Then in the 1960s, Hooi Kok Wai, one of the Four Heavenly Kings, modified the dish by adding sambal chilli and beaten eggs. The Heavenly Kings are the fathers of Cantonese cuisine in Singapore. The dish was traditionally eaten with baguette, but is now usually served with fried buns. When dipped into the sauce, the sweet, crispy dough complements the dish perfectly! I always order extra steam buns and mop up all the delicious sauce! Thanks for the spices, they just arrived! It is midnight in Takasaki and you just made my stomach growl. Morning. Eat before it gets cold. Thanks for the food. Masato! Hey, Uncle! Look, I made it again. What's this? It's soup. Another failed attempt at Chinese soup? I am confident this time. Try it, please! Brother. Once again, we're out of toothpicks. Please… Brother! Dad! Dad! Hey! It's all in Mandarin. My precious Masato, thank you for coming into my life. Dear Kazuo, I miss you. You okay? Give a kiss for me to Masato. Write to me. Okay? Wee I'm going to pour this. Yes, that's okay. Very good! Good? I should have taken better care of him. I probably gave him a hard time. I know it wasn't easy for you in school. Uncle. Did his heart become as hard as stone because of Mom? How could you even say that! Of course not! Your mother was like... a goddess to him. A goddess? If not for your mother, this Ramen shop may not have survived. Whenever they were back in Japan, he tried very hard to create a new flavour. Their creation brought more customers to our shop. He kept her memory alive with every bowl of Ramen. You get the bill. Right, let's go! Take care of yourself. All the best! Thanks Grandma. - Kota, you're in good hands! - Be good! See you later! Father, I don't want to go! Masato, wait! What can I get for you? Pork rib soup and dough fritters. You mean Yao Zha Guai? That's it, Yao Zha Guai. Pork rib soup and fried fritters. Are you Japanese? Yes. How are you? I'm fine. Can you speak Japanese? A little. I like the TV show, Oshin. Oshin? Do you like Japanese music? Yes! Do you like pork rib soup? Yes! I like pork rib soup. The soup is so good. The soup tastes just like Ramen broth. This is the best pork rib soup in Singapore! I'm glad you like it. Masato? Nice to meet you. I am Masato Yamamoto. It feels like we've known each other for a long time. I'm Miki. This is a small gift from Takasaki. Thank you. Don't mention it. Please. Okay. This is my favourite chicken rice stall. Even Gordon Ramsay came here to learn from them. Roast and steamed chicken. And a plate of beansprouts. Wow, you can speak Mandarin? I've lived here for many years. I see. Thank you. Thank you. Amazing! Right. These are the sauces for the chicken rice. They are made with fresh chilli, ginger, and garlic, and most importantly, calamansi juice. Calamansi? The good ones use freshly squeezed juice instead of rice vinegar. Oh, I see. You can tell just by smelling it. Wow, it smells amazing! Now smell the rice. Fragrant! Isn't it? You can tell the rice is cooked well because each grain is plump and unbroken. The smell comes from lemongrass, ginger, garlic and pandan leaves which is commonly used in Southeast Asia to give flavour and colour. Pandan leaves? Now, look at the chicken. The really good ones have a layer of jelly under the skin. Look at it. I see it. Right? You really know your chicken rice! Shall we eat? Let's eat! Delicious! Isn't it good? It's really delicious. I'm glad you like it. I've forgotten it tasted this good! I was born here, and I lived here for a while with my parents. Yes, you've mentioned it. For how long? Until I was ten. You haven't been back since? No. In fact, I came here to look for my uncle. My mother used to take me to his pork rib soup shop. I just can't forget it. It has been on my mind for the longest time. A bit spicy, isn't it? Very spicy! - But very tasty, ya? - It's really delicious. Yes! There's so much garlic! What brought you here to Singapore? I came here and got married. Your husband is Singaporean? Japanese. I mean, ex-husband. Sorry. It's alright. It's so good. This is good too. I should try it. Give it a try. Miki. Oh, Masato. I decided to drop by. This is my boss Hideki. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Welcome to Singapore. Have a seat. Excuse me. What a nice bar. Thank you. This is Mr Keisuke. He is a celebrity Ramen shop owner in Singapore. Oh! Thank you. This is Masato Yamamoto. His family runs a famous Ramen shop in Takasaki. I see. I am Masato Yamamoto. Nice to meet you, I'm Keisuke. Nice to meet you. Mr Keisuke has had an interesting journey. From being a Ramen champion in Tokyo to opening his chain of Ramen shops here. He even trained as a French chef! Amazing! Miki, it was a struggle in the beginning. Is that so? I hardly had any customers in the first year. I was worried that my business would close down. I thought I knew what Singaporeans liked but I was wrong. It was challenging but a great learning experience. My father was a chef here in the 80s. Cooking Ramen? No, Kaiseki. I see. He must have been one of the pioneer Japanese chefs. His boss sent him here during the economic boom and his customers were mostly Japanese. Welcome! Today is my day off. The restaurant is open only for you tonight. Take a seat. I'm not cooking Kaiseki tonight but many popular Japanese dishes for you. Thank you. Appetiser. Delicious! Here is the sashimi. Wasabi and soya sauce. Thank you for the dinner, it was delicious. You are welcome. Today is your day off? Why don't you spend it with your family? I have no family here. That's why on my days off, I go everywhere to eat pork rib soup. On your next day off, can I give you a treat? To thank you for this wonderful dinner. Barbeque pork buns. Barbeque pork buns. Prawn dumpling, pork dumpling. Prawn dumpling, pork dumpling. Pork dumpling. And Big Bun. Big Bun! Big Bun. So big! Big Bun. Try it. Let's eat. I wish I could read Japanese. Japanese comics. Okay. I will teach you. A balloon is … It's a balloon … coming through the window. … coming from the outside. The balloons. Let me teach you how to cut this. Yes … okay? I found this in my father's room. My mother's journal. Journal? It's written in Mandarin though … May I take a look? Please. Your mother took this journal with her on her first trip to Japan. She stopped but started writing again when she realised she was sick. The entries were her personal messages to you. This journal is like … a quilt of memories that she stitched together. Does it make sense? She also left you many recipes. Minced pork, steamed egg, chicken curry … and her soups! Mom always had soup for us. What else is in there? Your mother wanted to reconcile with your grandmother. What happened between them? She didn't go into detail. It was her hope that one day a real photo will replace this drawing. Please continue. Your father always talked about his home city of Takasaki. He said it was very beautiful. In Takasaki, there is a huge statue of the Goddess of Mercy. You can climb the statue and enjoy the view and greenery. In Singapore, I was looking for a place to give him comfort for a long time. It's beautiful. I know that you miss home. I have sacrificed a lot to get to where I am. Mei Lian. I know that I can make a lot of people happy with my food. But only one person's happiness matters … I can't imagine how much time and effort you spent researching these foods. Koki used to say it's like treasure hunting. Koki? My son. Not that I'm complaining, but he's the reason I work two jobs. He looks like you. You think so? I'd love to meet him one day. I always thought my blog was just a frivolous hobby. It never occurred to me that one day I could help someone because of it. If not for you, I wouldn't even know where to start. In that case, I should charge a fee for being your tour guide. Right? Please keep it affordable. Look. Labourers used to carry goods from the ships to the warehouses. It was hard labour, and they needed their strength. They couldn't afford meat. So they boiled pork bones in Chinese herbs for nourishment. I see. I know someone who may know the old pork rib soup sellers. Really? Hopefully they know where your uncle has moved to. The name of a World War 2 exhibition housed at the Former Ford Factory building has been changed after strong reaction from the public. Some Singaporean felt Syonan Gallery glorified a painful chapter in the country's history and caused a lot of hurt to those who suffered and lost family members during the Japanese Occupation. Syonan Gallery: War And Its Legacies will be renamed Surviving the Japanese Occupation: - War And Its Legacies. - Uncle Akio calling. All these shops are food related? Yes. Amazing, right? Indeed. Pastries! They're handmade. It's interesting. This is the place! Here? Yes. Though Bak Kut Teh literally means Pork Bone Tea, the tea is not actually in the bowl with the soup. I see. That's interesting. It was common practice then. After their meal of pork rib soup, customers would have tea and catch up with their friends So the meal not only helps fill your stomach, it also helps you bond with your friends. I see. He looks like Ah Wee from Heng Rong Pork Rib Soup. He was so young then! I heard he's opened his own place. What's it called? I can't remember. Wang, do you remember that cheeky boy Ah Wee? He used to make me laugh all the time. What's his new shop called? Reunion Pork Rib Soup Restaurant. Let's eat. Would you like some soup? And you? Yes. You? Thank you, enjoy yourselves. How can I help you? You want some more soup? And you? Yes. Thank you. Where did you get this picture? Masato? Uncle. Come in! We're back My nephew. Hello. My wife. Just call her Auntie. Come in. The two of you, come out of your room! Come and meet your cousin. Come on. Say hello. Hello! Hi! Sit, sit. Please take a seat. Thank you. Masato, this is a Singaporean home cooked dinner. It's very delicious, cooked by my wife. Thank you for cooking. Come on, let's start eating! Let's eat! Thank you. Masato, I think you should stay with us. I have an extra store room. I mean I have an extra room. A spare room. It's okay. Come on, your hotel room is so expensive. Don't feel bad. Just pay me half your hotel rate. I am just kidding. Come, try the fish. - This fish is very expensive. - Very delicious. Thank you. Don't worry about it. Have some soup. Give him some soup. My father was Teochew. He was a great cook. My mother is Cantonese. Also a great cook. Delicious, right? Masato, have you visited the Singapore Zoo? No. Jurong Bird Park? No. Then why are you here? Just to look for me? Uncle. Can you teach me how to cook pork rib soup? I want to take it back to Japan. You are not here for a holiday? Young man, pork rib soup is not an easy dish to cook. I always think of Mom's cooking, and your pork rib soup. Your father used to crave my pork rib soup. I would send it all the way to your home. But I didn't mind it! Because it made everybody happy. My parents are gone. I want to remember them by cooking pork rib soup. Uncle. Can I ask you something? You've come all the way from Japan. Of course you can ask. I found my mother's old diary. She wrote about Grandma. Why have I not met her? Come. Drink. Wow, what is this? Try it. Alright then. Let's eat. How is it? Incredible! Glad you like it! This is really good. What is this? This is called Fish Head Curry. It was created by an Indian man in Singapore. I suppose that the different races and cultures in Singapore are reasons for the variety found in Singaporean cuisine! Yes, you're absolutely right. Many Singapore hawkers started by selling food on pushcarts in the street. Pork rib soup and Ramen both started out as street food. They were cheap and mainly food for the labourers, but are now so popular they've become national dishes. Did you know that Ramen is a fairly new dish in Japan? It wasn't as popular in the past. Oh yes, it was called Chinese Noodles back then, right? And now Ramen is one of the most popular foods in Japan. Are you excited to finally learn how to make pork rib soup? That's the reason why I came to Singapore. You're hooked, aren't you? You are like Ramen, a blend of Chinese and Japanese cuisine. You think so? Yes. The good part of both cultures runs in your blood. I hope that is true … Yes Masato. Let's go. Wake up. The kitchen is over there. Okay, Masato. You have to choose the freshest ribs. The fresh ones are bloody. Blood, okay. Yes You have to chop them about 2 inches thick. 2 inches! 2 inches! 2 inches! Yes! Okay. All the ribs here are for making the soup. This is what you ate that day. These ribs are fresh. There are also traces of blood. And the meat must be tender See? Tender. Springy? Yes! Springy. We cook the soup first. Boil for at least 5 hours. 5 hours. Yes. The soup will then be very sweet. Sweet. And fresh! Fresh. After which you must add pepper. Pepper. From Sarawak in Malaysia. Sarawak, Malaysia. It's the best. Sarawak? Yes. Singapore is very humid. The pepper will help to expel wind from your body. Okay. And also, garlic. We have to use old garlic. Old is good. Like you. Next is salt? After it's been boiled for 5 hours. We add another kind of pork rib inside. On low fire, we cook it for another 5 hours. Low heat, 5 hours. Yes, 5 hours. Ribs for eating. Cook for 45 minutes. 45 minutes. Yes. After 45 minutes, the water comes to a boil. Turn down the heat. Cook it over low heat. Why do we call the dish Bak Kut Teh? It was customary to drink Chinese tea after eating pork ribs. Remember. When you pour the tea, you have to do it clockwise. Clockwise, like so. I see. That's it. Okay. Come. Try it. Thank you. Cheers. Blow on it before drinking. Blow. Blow. Drink. Delicious! Delicious. Delicious. Good? Good. Okay, come. Let's eat the pork ribs, and then drink the tea. Alright. Two more scoops? Yes, that's about right. Just a little more A little more? This much? Enough. Please go ahead. Perfect! Fantastic! How is it? My mouth is watering. Two more to go. Counting on you! You two are a fantastic team. Do you think so? Sometimes he doesn't even lift a finger. He's in a good mood today. Mom, that's because you are the best cook. You don't need my help. Oh thank you, but I need you. Of course, I need you. Tonight I can enjoy a nice home cooked meal! I'm done! Thank you for cooking! Thank you. I'm off to bed soon. Good night! He's very mature. Is that so? Are you two always like that? Like what? So frank and candid with one another? Not your typical Japanese? You could say that. I was always with my mother in the kitchen when she cooked. I used to cling to her apron. After she passed away, I couldn't fall asleep without her apron. It smelt of milk and flour and reminded me of her. And even though it was dirty, I wouldn't let anyone wash it. I treasured it. I still have it with me today. This is my favourite. Help yourself. Coconut flavour. It's delicious. Both of you do as I tell you. And for you, I have done my best. The rest depends on your luck. Please be nice to her, okay? Okay. Ma! You are all here. Come on in. Grandma! Come in! We brought ingredients to cook a delicious meal. Why bother to cook when you are so busy at the shop? We can eat out. It's alright. Who is this? One of your employees? What a handsome young man. You look just like a Korean idol. What's your name? Mom, his name is Masato. Ma … what? Mei Lian's son. Hello, Grandma. Mom! Mom! Mom, open the door! Come and meet your Grandson. Ridiculous! You want to marry that foreigner who comes to the shop every week? How well do you know him? He's so much older than you. For all you know, he already has a wife and kids in Japan. No, he doesn't. We've been together for a year and a half. A year and a half? And you're only telling me now? In your heart, is that man more important to you than your mother? I'm sorry, Mom. You two know why our family hates the Japanese. They killed your grandfather. And now you want to marry one of them? Mom, that happened so long ago! Isn't it good that Sis has found someone who loves her? Are you two ganging up on me? Sis. Are you really going to leave Kazuo? What choice do I have? You do have a choice. Just follow your heart. I can tell that Kazuo really cares for you. Marry him. But Mom said she would disown me. After a while, she will forgive you. You really think so? That's why she did it? Because of you? It was a mistake. I thought your grandmother was just trying to scare your mother. Then things got worse. Relatives started to talk behind her back. After she got married, Grandma stopped talking to her. Why is she so mean? Masato. I've taught you how to cook our family's pork rib soup. Can you promise me one thing? Just leave Grandma alone. I remember walking down New Bridge Road. And my father had gone ahead, and I was walking behind him, looking at all the people who are dead and dying. And the smell, you get the smell of dead, dying, rotten bodies and things like smoke, haze was still around. I came across a Chinese lady, she had a baby in her arms and the baby was crying. And I thought, oh, poor baby, it's hungry, I'll go and pick it up and take it. We had first aid posts all over the place by this time. I'll take the baby to them. Before I could get to her, a Japanese sentry came down, went to the woman, picked the baby up and I thought, oh, he's going to take the baby to the first aid. You know what he did? He threw the baby up in the air and let it fall on the point of his blade. And I could see the blood running down. I was horrified. I couldn't believe what I'd seen. I thought my mind was playing tricks, I thought it must be my imagination. When I first arrived in Takasaki, I was carrying so much pain and fear. But slowly, I was able to heal. The Goddess of Mercy earned the right to enter Nirvana but gave that up and remained on earth to ease human suffering. The Japanese believe that the Daruma doll can grant wishes. And when your wish is fulfilled, you dot the other eye. I learnt that when life's toils get too much, the beauty of nature is a good remedy. It soothes and shields us from life's ugly realities. Of course, we know that nothing lasts forever. Nature's frailty reminds us that life is delicate. Life is fleeting. We need to fight and protect what is precious. I took a bold step but I believe I made the right decision. Mom has always been strong willed. When Father died, she took care of the business. At that time, some customers said Without her Teochew husband, this Cantonese woman can't possibly make good pork rib soup. But she made it even better. Your mother must have been devastated. She wasn't just devastated. She was angry at the whole world. My sister died six months after falling ill. It's terrible for a parent to have to bury her child. She didn't even get to see Mei Lian one last time. Don't you think that's pitiful. Masato. I think you've had enough. Don't you think my grandmother is horrible? That Madam Lee … Why did my mother have to suffer? She didn't do anything bad. Give me another shot. You should stop. Another shot, please. How could you do that to your own daughter? I don't understand a word you're saying. You're being a nuisance. Leave! Wait, wait. Because of you, this is all I have left of her. Do you know what this is? Mom's journal. It is filled with sorrow. Did you enjoy torturing her? Just because Father was Japanese, it was his fault? Is that his fault? Doesn't matter where he's from, does it? Doesn't matter where he's from, does it? So what? Why am I here? Do I not exist to you? How dare you shout at me? What do you know? Because of you, my mother died in sorrow. I'm left with nothing. I'm left with nothing! They loved each other. See for yourself. Get lost! Miki: Did you get home safely last night? Hey. It's so late, what are you doing? This is for Grandma. She's so angry with you and you want to do this for her? She won't accept it. But I must try. It's also for my mother. Hey! Why are you putting chicken into the pot? I want to make a very special Ramen for Grandma. How is it special? Ramen mixed with Bak Kut Teh. Ramen Teh? Good idea! Maybe I can help you! Mr Keisuke. Welcome. What a nice restaurant. Shall we start? Okay! I prepared this for you. Thanks for your help. I know that you're busy. Not a problem at all. Oh yes, Mr Keisuke, I made a new one. Soup? Yes. What do you think? Very tasty! I'm relieved. For this broth, I think you should go with thin noodles. Straight, thin noodles. Should I add more water then? Besides the amount of water, you must also think about the type of flour we use, especially in Singapore's humid weather. I see. It's good. Glad to hear that. Mom, Masato wishes to apologise for the other night. He asked me to teach him how to make pork rib soup. He created a special Ramen dish for you and hopes you can forgive him. There is a void in my heart that I cannot fill. The past plays constantly in my mind. I dream of going back to the good old days. Mom and my little brother, I miss how we used to be. I am Masato. Very good. Can you teach me more Mandarin? Yes. I am crazy. I am crazy. … crazy? I am crazy. Hey, crazy. Someone is here to see you. I am crazy. I am crazy. I will teach you how to cook these dishes. Curry. Curry? Small pieces. That's correct. Same amount. Yes, yes! Stir it. Stir it? I see. Thank you, Thank you for the food. Let's eat. This taste… Let's eat Mom. I am sorry. Hi, table for two? This way please. Welcome. Let's eat. Tasty.
