You're moving in with your mother ? -Oh no. No way, no. Look at her. Look at how beautiful she is. Is she the kind of woman that you can leave ? And Emma who's conforting herself with a pizza. -Yeah, well that's all I have left. -I have to film that, it's a work of art. -Max, you're a drag. -Did he have an accent from the South ? I want to read it with an accent from the South. "Emma, "More than you, I am in love with your heart. "I love it, because it keeps my heart beating." You know what? He could have stopped here, but he goes on, this fucker. "At 100 km/h, "faster than the light reflecting in your eyes "when the sun shines." Heh seriously, you didn't lose much.

I am worthless. -Talk to the camera. -"Talk to the camera" You did you think you were ? Woody Allen ? -I thought I was your mother. Tell me what's wrong. -Nothin, I... I'm gonna fail my year that's all. It's so stupid to fail your third year when you haven't failed before that. -What are you going to do ? -I'm going to stop I think. I'm not made for this. -You're going to stop medical studies entirely ? But what are you going to do ? -I don't know, I... I want to see stuff, travel, go around the world. I want to go on doing photos. I am going to do that seriously. -So as someone who has seen your photos, if may give you and advice, continue your medical studies. Even if you are to become a podiatrist, but continue your medical studies. -Excuse me, but look who's talking ? Is it Max the actor or Max the pizza delivery boy ? No because it's not very clear. Come on, do an act. Do an act for me. So, what's the script of your next casting ? -No but... I no longer work with script. -What's that ? -Yes, without a scrip, you can convey more things, that's where you can really shine. -Then do something without a script. -But it won't turn out good. -Come on! -What do you want ? -I don't know, something you've already worked on. -Well right now... No it's stupid, but I worked on The beach, the weed field scene. -Go on, I can't remember. -You're not kidding with me ? It's when they arrive at the weed field. The two of them are walking and DiCaprio see a little monkey. At first he thinks it's cute, but when he starts looking down, he sees the guard sleeping with his gun. When the monkey sees him, he gets excited, so he make signs for the monkey to calm down. All this sequence. -Go on, OK. -Shush. Stop it, damn ! -But that's crap ! -You don't get it. -I understand why you're a delivery boy. -Are at the new rich's place ? -I'm really sick. -Close the door. -How to match money and bad taste ?

Calme down. -Mathias ! -Eh, come back. -Say something. -Mathias, talk to me damn ! -Today is... A man different from the rest left before us, when we still had so many things to live together. More than a friend, he was a brother, who one could rely on anywhere, anytime. Mathias was the guy who would take a bullet for you. Before saying goodbye my brother, since you're no longer with us and we could what we want with your body... Emma if you'd please. -What the fuck are you doing ? -Oh shit you're not dead ! -I'm not ready. -Oh la la ! Your stuff is ready, we can leave. -Where to ? -We're going to have lunch all of us together. -I can't stand the food here anymore, it's awful. -You order, I don't want to . -Yeah, OK. -Huh ? -Yeah. -I'm glad to see you like this. -Me too. -You look good. -Thanks. What ? -Nothing ! -What ? What ? -In case we don't make it out alive, do you have a last message ? Sir, any last will ? We don't know each other, but if I can be of some help. -The're getting someone to come. -Oh no. There's never anyone, so on a Sunday, imagine. -I have asthma on top of that. -Oh shit ! So you will die before us. -Indeed. -Since it's almost the end, can you give me a sincere answer ? I am worried, because this young woman is in love with a DJ. -Come on, stop it. That's not funny ! -He's a guy who plays discs and comes home drunk at 6AM. -He doens't drink. -What do you think about it ? You can tell me the truth. -I don't know this man. -You know what ? He's convinced he knows him and that I let myselft impressed by a DJ. -Oh no, not at all. It's just that at almost 25 years old, that's the age where we start to get married, and I am worried. -You can tell him to stop worrying, because he's very gentle, and very attentive and he'd make a good husband. -Are you kiddding ? What's he going to say, this guy, at the town hall? "M. Sébastien Royer, DJ, "will you take as wife Mrs Emma Valéro ?" -Yes. -Mrs Emma Valéro, will you take as husband M. Sébastien Royer ? -Yes. -In the name of the law, I declare Mlle Emma Valéro and M. Sébastien Royer bound by marriage. You may kiss the bride. -Well, well, well. I'm not thanking anyone, because if you're all here, it's thanks to me. It's me who introduce them to each other. They've been together for quite a while. It's me who set up your first gigs. You remember when you were a small who just arrived from his countryside town and who took 70 euros per evening ? Oh damn... Look at you now. Look at you now ! You're... You're a small DJ who just arrived from his countryside town and who takes 70 euros per evening. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that the parents understand, I dare to say all that because it's family. Take care of each other. Even if I think it's a bit weird that we finance your travel around the world and that you don't come back. But well enjoy it anyway. Seb, I hope your career will take off after this tour. And Emma, that you career in photography as well. We will come to squat in Hamburg once you're settled. In this honor, I raise my glass... of Badoit, because I'm a good boy now. Cheers. And I'd like to dedicate a message to Arnaud et Christelle who are behind.

So what are we going to do if you sister is to stay with us ? -Just one night. -It's just for one night, well there's plenty of hotels and I don't see why we'd let your sister stay at the hotel, when we were just saying, the other day that we lacked... of... of girls in the flat. -We're just going to wait for my lad Arnaud to calm down. -Stay in the instant intentions. When Chloe tells you that her sister is coming, you've just had an argument, there's not enough space, there's not enough matresses, and you're already anticipating her entrance. You can't anticipate such things, you're not part of the audience. -It's better if we hold hands. -Go ahead. -Euh... All day long, I'm waiting, I'm waiting for yours to be over. I can't breath otherwise. Do you understand ? It's not just words to sound nice. -No, Max. You see, I don't believe that. The script is good, I head you, but I don't believe it. He's saying that he can't stand suffering anymore, he can't breath without her anymore. It's pure suffering. And you, you're not suffering. It's too mild. Have you ever been in love ? -Euh yes. -So think about that and redo the scene with with that in mind. -There you go. -Yes, madame ? -Hello Sir.

Then suddently the supervisor... -Stop. You stop the story here and you tell me the rest after the surgery. -Hello. -I'll wait for you here, OK ? I want to know the rest of the story of how cheated at the BAC. I want to know the details. -Go on. -Do what you need to do and I want the rest of this story. -SURPRISE ! -I'm not cured yet. -We'll help you to cure. Come on, come on.

That it would become the final scene of your film. And... I know that this film, is all your life and that you want to make it your occupation, so wait. The camera shouldn't be on me, because it is your film. I think it's important that it should end on you. I want you to tell me something and... Oh no wait, take my place. -Yeah. Oh fuck, no ! Oh, the bitch ! I knew it ! Oh fuck ! -Fifteen years ! Fifteen years that I've been waiting for my revenge ! It feels so good !
