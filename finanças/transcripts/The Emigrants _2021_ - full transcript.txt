- Did you buy anything, then? - If I bought something? What would I buy for? You deserve better than this pile of stones. Nonsense. You deserve the whole world. What am I going to do with the whole world? Once we were one. Once I did not know where your body ended and mine began. Your blood in my veins. An uninterrupted unity of love and pain. How about moving? Just leave everything. America. Minnesota. - You mean it? - There is land there. The most fertile soil, and they give it away for free. If you just want to work hard, you have to be your own master there. And no one is starving. If we travel so far away... so we'll never come home again, will we? Or? Never see mother and father again. Siblings, neighbors, all of us care. Even though they are alive, they will be dead to us. How are you thinking? - In four years, Lill-Märta will have to work. - It's not certain! Marriage is just to forget. Then it's Anna's turn, and Harald's. And then there will be more children. A life of bondage, Kristina. Always in someone else's service. Has anyone written from America and said that Lill-Märta will be the mistress there? You have no idea what America is for. You know nothing. - We could just as easily move to the moon. - It's just because it's unknown. You were afraid to move here too. Don't you remember that? Should we condemn our children to a life of misery because we dare not think for ourselves? I do not understand. Are you asking me or are you forcing me? - We must trust that God holds... - God helps the one who helps himself. Karl Oskar... Do you really think I would force you? I'm getting firewood. Do you have some potatoes or some food? Take a break now. You did not come here just to work. - Astrakhan apples... - I gave some to my only daughter. - Can we also get? - You are welcome. - Can I have more? - Do not be greedy. Come on. Come on. Anna, come on! What is it, Kristina? Karl Oskar talks about traveling to America... - Is he completely out of his mind? - He thinks we get better there. Better? At the bottom of the sea. Ship sinks, Kristina. The sea is the grave of the wicked. Karl Oskar says that the ships are completely safe. Yes. Has he told you about the savages? About the Indians? - The Indians? - Yes, godless beings. With feathers all over the body, half human, half animal. That can not be true, can it? One should not sit up against nature. If the Lord wanted you to live in America, He would have made you Americans. - He just mentioned it. - Yes. He is proud, your husband Karl Oskar. Do you know that... in America, where we will ride on an iron road. It's called a railway. On it go carts of iron, without animals. All by themselves. You light big fires in them, and then they just go. Faster than a hundred horses. - What is Denmark? - A country, you fool! - You can be stupid yourself. - Do not play with food. Stupid, stupid, stupid! - Do not play with the food, I say! - It does not matter. We can not let a grain go to waste. It's just mold and rot all the way. - It's going to be a hell of a winter. - Sch! Do not talk like that! Be good and help! Do we get strangers? Is it the mortgage rate? Kristina! Mother, father! It is burning! - What happens? - It is burning! Marta... - Stay there, children. The harvest...! - Satan! - Mother! - Come on, Johan! More water! It's left in there. The wheat is still in there! It's burning up, damn it. It is too late... For it is the Lord himself who appears in the trial. Therefore, you should consider yourself happy for every misfortune he puts on your path. I know there are people in the parish talking about America. Spreads lies about rich land and free land. But do not listen to them. They're just looking for one thing. They're just looking for one thing. To mint coins from your misfortune. Trust in the Lord. Show humility before the trial, and you will be heard. Let's pray. Praise be to God, and glory forever. Dear God, thank you for holding your hand over us. Thanks for the kids. Thanks for Karl Oskar. I know you're trying us - -but it is difficult not to be able to put food on the table. Just help us through this winter. What? I needed to pee. Kristina. I've been thinking about you like that. - It's not much, but... - But dear, it's way too much. Look, Karl Oskar. - Bless you. - Here is some bread, and some meat. We have slaughtered this year, so we manage. - I do not know what to say... - Next time it's us. He must pay for himself. Disappear! Listen, you shit. You have to pay like decent people. I will not leave until I have received my money. Gladan is not welcome here. Harass a good Christian man. - But in your bed I'm welcome! - Now you leave good people in peace. I am happy to leave the sheriff alone. You do not even get it. You can all burn in hell! What are you looking at? Little Kristina from Duvemåla. Do you think that you are better than me? You also spread your legs to get food on the table. - Disappear! - Let me go! For God opposes the proud. But he humbles the humble. But no. Anna, stop! One must not. Wait. So. - What are you doing? - So. Share it. Do you want? You can take it. Take the little one. That's all I found. Three potatoes. That is all. It's not enough... whatever I do. - It's not enough. - Yes, of course it does. I'm not good enough for you. You... Of course you are. We are the best friends. Right? What is a home? A bed? A pot? A cracked cup? The soil you grow from? Or the soil you sow in? - Is that the sea? - It never ends. Yes, then. And we will cross it with a large ship with sails and five high masts. Just wait, you'll see. Maybe you can control too! It's called the captain. Captain Lill-Märta. - Nonsense! - Yes, sorry. Kristina, I mean. Captain Kristina. You probably never give up, you. But... there must be something wrong. Set down. - Is this ship Charlotta? - Yes. - But it should have five masts. - Are you coming? - What did you say? - Are you going or not? Do you have a contract? - Do you have a contract? - Yes, yes, yes. You have to hold on to mother. Hold on mom. So. Marta. Marta, give me that one. Did it go well? Quiet in the boat! Now we are sitting nicely here. Shall I help you? Here. - Come on, Johan. - Go backwards. Men in that direction, women down here. - But we travel together. - We are a family. - Nice, but everyone here is families. - Do we have problems here? We can do it, no problem. Me and the kids go this route. - You go down there. - And you go before. - It's fine. Thanks. - And the children there. - Did you hear that? - No, I'm taking it. - I take it. - There will be more space gradually. - Why? You with the baby, here! This one you take. - Here? - Yes. Good. Kristina herself from Duvemåla. Have you seen a ghost? Are you afraid of me? Va? - I have paid for a place on the ship. - I have not said anything. - I am as much right as anyone else. - Mother, please. Maybe you should find another place that pleases your wife. Shut up now. - In America, everyone is equal. - Easier to transport animals than old women... Shut up, old bastard! Now I think you should calm down a bit. Do not tell me what to do, priestess! I'll pray for you. Come on, Elin. It's a shame about her. God will punish her on the Day of Judgment. Are these your children? - My name is Judit Olausson. - Kristina Nilsson. - And what's your name? - Lill-Märta. - This is little Harald. - And so little Harald. How good you are at taking care of little brother. You're going too... Are you going to America too? Yes. I am the wife of Peter, who is a priest. - A priest? - Yes. It's nice that we have a priest with us on board. A priestess... Do not run too far. No rest, no peace. Does the wife have children? No. God has other plans for us. Yes. So it may be. Such fucking pigs. Pay half the farm to be treated like cattle. - This is Judit. - Mr Nilsson, I guess? - Judit is a priestess. - Peter, come on! - Hello. - A priest going to America. Peter has been called to a Swedish church in Wisconsin. - Follow! - Yes please! - Thanks, but we're going to Minnesota. - Yes. Mainsail! Two more moves! I'm with children again. Yes, that was inappropriate. I can not have children whenever it suits you either! Can you not just say that it will go well? Please... It will be fine. And then we sniff that fucking captain on a ticket too. Over there, Elin, they treat women like queens. What do you know about it? Everyone walks around with classy hats. And if you rape a lady, you get hung up. - Hanged? - Mm. - First hung, then shot. - Please, calm down. The children are trying to sleep. But what in the world... No... - What is it? - It's none of your business. Lice? Do you have lice? Sch! Silent! If you have lice, you can stay away from us. I've never had a lice on my body in my whole life. - It's you who have let us down! - Me? You heard what I said. - Well, do I have lice? - Yes, I think you have. She's accusing me. She's going to apologize. I would rather fall on my knees for the evil self. - Take that back! - Should I crawl for a whore? I'm not going to be ashamed. - We are not ashamed of anyone. - Ulrika... - Look, then! Do you see any lice? - You might want to take a look? - Cover yourself! - Calm down. - Do you see any lice, or? May God deliver us from this insidious disease. Help us... gentle Lord God. Amen. Bowl! Yes, yes, yes! In my hand I now hold the whole world. The pearl of the American language - everything you need. And as you can get. Half a daler. - Can we, please, buy it? - We have no money, my friend. If God Wants Us to Speak American - - he will make sure we know when we get ashore. So the priestess has hired the Lord herself as a teacher? Good luck with that, you. It's yours for a quarter of a dollar. It does not hurt to help Our Lord get started. But... But one should not read anything other than catechesis. - Do not listen, she's just talking shit. - Shut up. You're drunk, get out of here! Come on, let's dance! Be careful. I know a lovely pink o, white as a lily leaf When I think of her, my heart is made happy Its voice gives a heartfelt consolation like the gentle voice of the nightingale so beautiful and so sweet Anna! Anna, come on. Come and play. Anna. Anna, come on. Come on, let's play. Anna. No, Anna! The porridge must swell first. You will get a very bad stomach ache. Anna? Marta, have you moved on the porridge? No. Have you taken the porridge, Johan? Anna? - Anna! Have you eaten all the porridge? - I would just taste. What are you thinking, girl? What should we eat now? Sorry. Ouch! - What is it? - It hurts so much. - So. - Aj... Now we go in. She has eaten everything. - No... - Fucking doctor who's not coming. The groats have swelled in her stomach. This does not work, we have to try again. So, little friend. Little friend, try now. You must try to get... The groats must come out, otherwise the stomach will burst. Did something happen? - Come here. - Aj... - So. - No, it hurts too much. - We have to do something! - Let her go! She does not want more! Mother is here with you, mother takes care of you. - Spare her... - Mother takes care of you. I'm going to be more humble. Anna? Anna? So. Come with Grandma now. - But I want to be with mother. - No not now. I should have put the porridge higher up. - I should understand how hungry she was. - It's too much twig. Why did he take her? What does God want from us? It was not God, it was hunger. - It's my fault and no one else's. - No, Karl Oskar. Twig... It's too much fucking twig! We should have left. We should have left. I follow you. If you think it's best for us... then I will follow you. Kristina, here is mother's apple... mother's apple tree. - Should it be included? All the way? - It's done. - There are apples in America, right? - Not astrakhan! I wish I could write. But Karl Oskar can. He writes. Letter from America. Imagine, mother. I do not want your letters. It's for the sake of the children. Wait! The apple tree! The apple tree, well. Then it is probably best that you take care of it. If there was a bridge back... If I could take the kids and turn around... had I done it then? I've made a promise. I'm following him. We go out and get some air. Come on. It's locked. Hello! It's locked! Open! Hello! Let us out! A crow! America!! Come on. Do you see the country over there? Do you know what it is? It's America. What is a home? The country you come from? Or the place you give birth to your children? We have arrived! What is a home? - Now it is important that we stick together. - It's rocking. America is rocking! - Do you have it? - Yes. Can you take it? Johan, hold me on the other side here, so I can see you. Here you go. Lill-Märta, stay close now. Go close to father. Do we have everything now? Do we have everything? If you disappear here, we will never find you again. Hold on to us. Stay close now, Lill-Märta. Walk in front of me here. Go for Dad. Sweets, madam? Hold each other. Excuse me, are you going somewhere, sir? How... how to get to Minnesota? Sorry? Sorry, I do not understand. Minn... Minnesota. Wait. - We'll put this down. - Minnesota? - Yes, Minnesota! I can show the way. The train leaves from Albany Station. I can show, for a penny. Minnesota. - Minnesota... - Minnesota. - Maybe we should go back to the boat? - I'm solving this. No. Goodbye. We're going a little further. Hey! My Swedish friends. That book is completely useless. They do not understand a word. For five dollars I can show the way. Five dollars? Are you not wise, man? It costs a small penny. - But five dollars can not be... - We share it. - Are you going to Minnesota too? - Of course. Obvious. Listen, it's going to be perfect. Then we say six dollars. Three for you and three for you, then you share it. I'm not traveling with that woman. Only until we arrive, then we get rid of her. Three dollars was. Then you lead us all the way to Minnesota, to Taylor Falls. - And I speak English. - We are with. Three dollars. I like Johan. - Come around here to me, Johan. - He can take in my basket. - No, he's holding me. - Johan, you take my hand. - Then I'll lead you. Closer father. Much, much closer. Do they know where we are going? - Do you have the whole farm with you? - Yes, not enough. - Closer father. - Let us go, let us go. Fresh corn daily. - Nää... - Hold together now. Beware! Incoming trains! The newspaper! Now comes the train. Do you see? Latest news! - What the hell best! - Do you see? There's the train driver. - Do you have the tickets? - Yes, here. - Do you know where we're going? - Yes, follow me. - Come with me, you little one. - We can handle ourselves, thank you. A little more. Here. Put it down. Rise and shine. Elin, come on. Johan, come here. - Where's Lill-Märta? - Is not she with you? - You had her. - But I took the coffin. - Have you lost her? - Marta! Marta! Have you lost her ?! - Marta! Marta! Marta! Marta! - Can you hold him? Please. I will be there as fast as I can. Marta! Marta! Lill-Märta! Lill-Märta! Lill-Märta! Marta! Lill-Märta! Everyone on board! Last call! - We have lost our daughter! - I do not understand. The train departs according to schedule. Are you going or not? Everyone on board! Last call! - Is she here? Are you sure? - Marta! There she is! - Stop the train! - Little Marta! Stop the train! Stay! Stop, then! Stay! - Watch out for the train, lady. - We're coming! - What said? I do not understand. - Give me that, now! Give it here, then! Running! No! She forgot her fucking plant. Are you completely out of your mind, woman ?! Go down from there! You do not leave kids behind! You could have ironed! We can hold you accountable for that. I do not understand what the passenger is saying, but there were children on board! You do not leave kids behind, do you hear that ?! What are you people who leave women and children behind you? She looks like you. I just want to say thank you. For what you did for Lill-Märta. I had never made it. I just did what every sensible person would have done. I have not had the right to judge you. Uh, don 't think about it. I have not been fair. I want to ask your forgiveness for that. My forgiveness? Yes Yes. What are you going to do with it now? It is difficult to do right before God. When Karl Oskar wanted to travel, I refused. A mother should protect her children, right? But it was pride. Therefore... he took my Anna. So when Lill-Märta disappeared today, so... I understood that I have not learned anything. That was God's warning to me. Do you really believe that? That God would sacrifice your child to punish you? There must be a meaning. My... My first was six months old when they took him from me. Took him from you? Yes. I was fourteen. What did I have to say about? An orphaned vomit that was sold to the lowest bidding farmer in Ålarum. He was the father. I had no idea about that. My second got three days. He was so small, could not stand life. He just let go... like he did not want to be here. Tell me, what was it God punished me for then? Was that my pride? My fourteen-year-old orphan pride? Was that it? Sorry. I did not know. You do not know shit. Can you start again? Can you recreate yourself? Are we moving into this country? Or is it the country that is moving into us? - There, then. What does it say? - Farm. So, farmhouse. It's called a farm. It's called farm. Farm... farm... Kristina, wake up! What is this? Open! - Have you been out? - Open now. Have you conjured? - Look, we have milk too! - Where did you get this? At the previous station. Do not believe, Elin. - There's nothing left. - Yes. So you say thank you. - You are welcome. - Thanks. Why do they avoid us? It's like they saw hell themselves. It's because of the cholera. It comes with the boat. We're putting them down here. Yes, then we arrived. - Then we part. Thank you for the company. - Va...? That was the deal. Taylors Falls, Minnesota. We have arrived. Hope you are well. My journey continues on that boat. Aren't you also going to leave? You heard him, we're here now. We do not leave anyone on the street. Hello, ladies! Watch out for! Wait here. Mat... Mat... - Food, yes... - He wants food. How is it going? Newcomers? I'm Pastor Jackson. Pastor? If he's a priest there, I'm the virgin mother. You look like you need a meal. - Yes. - We want food. Food? Come on! - Thanks! - Follow. So... miss Ulrika. Missis. Well, there is a husband? MAN? Ma... man! Yes. MAN... death. But mother... I thought you might want to wash yourself... before dinner. Now the pastor wants to get the clothes off us too. Is it... Does anyone live there? Other people... live... - Here. - Very... indian... Yes. Indians. Bow and arrow. No. Here. Here, good. Norrut, no. Now our lice get to greet each other. Hu! Not so hot. Come on, Elin. You lied to the pastor. What then? Should I have said I'm Glad from Ljud instead? And you steal. You stole the money for the trip. I just took what he owed me. The pig did not want to pay for himself. Please. Dear, do not cry. Elin, I just wanted to give us another chance. I'm so scared for your soul's sake. You do not need to be that. God sees the difference between small and large sins. - What did you say? - He's not stupid. He probably sees a difference between you and an old scapegoat. Whoremonger? Whoremonger...! - Horbock! - Mother never said that, did she? Come on, Elin. Horbock, huh? Karl Oskar... The earth is barren. Do you see? Barely better than at home. You are so good with the earth. You can make it germinate anyway, right? - We have to move on. - We just came here. Stay here with the kids for a few days. I'll pick you up when I find a plot of land further north. - We can not separate. - Just a little while. We have not traveled this far just to be content with this. - There are savages out there. - I know what I'm doing. - Why do you never ask where I think? - Va? I do, right? You might think you do. Do not hang your head like that now. We are in America! Think, what luck we have. We have to start all over again. Karl Oskar will surely find a nice place. I just wish he didn 't have to go that far from people. How are we going to get out there, alone out in the wilderness? Men only think of themselves, you know. No... Karl Oskar thinks of us. He just does not want to be in debt to anyone, he wants to fend for himself. What about you? What do you want? - Me? - Yes. I ponder too much. He knows what's best. We have to have food on the table. Karl Oskar says... Karl Oskar, Karl Oskar, Karl Oskar. You have to stand up, woman. You make it sound so easy. Light and light. If there's one thing I know, one thing I learned - - it is that you can do more than you think. Every human being has powers in reserve. Believe me. Shouldn't he be back soon? Karl Oskar, Karl Oskar, Karl Oskar. Oh! You should have one like that. - Yes! - You should have one like that. - It is very nice in color. - I want one of those. Purple. There is something about the flowers too... Another time. My lovely ladies, are you coming here again? A beautiful hat for a beautiful lady. For a beautiful girl like you, we can certainly agree on something. Not true? Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Peter Abbot. - Me, Abbot... - No, come on, we're going. - You do not even know what he said. - I understand more than enough. Abbot. Abbot. - Ulrika Abbot. It's Karl Oskar! Tell! I've found it. - Have you made a lunch bag for us? - It's just some bread. - I wish you could come along. - What should I do out there? - Marry a coyote? - We will visit each other, right? No, save on order. People have left Gladan before. But we are friends. You're my best friend in America. - Friends? - Yes of course! See you soon. - Is it far from here? - No. Half a day march only. So. Hey! It seems far. Here? Ki-Chi-Saga Lake. Come on, my boy. Now we're home. This is where we'll be staying. Come on. Look, all this is ours. - All this? - All this. All you can see. - Is ours? This is ours! - It's only temporary... Yes! All this is ours! And then I thought that the house should be over here. - Where then? - Here. And then the barn next door. There is plenty of fish in the lake as well. I got two fat trout on the first try. - How nice. - Yes. - Johan! Johan! - Yes. Won't you come and help me unload? - Va? - Help me unload. Yes. - How long are we going to be here? - Forever. - No. - Yes! Forever. - Have we moved? - Yes, we have moved here. - No, we do not have it. - Yes! Do not you believe me? Home is gone. Gone is home. The two can never change places. I can never tie the two together. Dear God, take me back. If only you could stretch out your strong arm and take me back. Are you so sad? I... thought you were asleep. Sorry. Can't you talk to me? I'm back sometime tonight. I'm freezing. We just have to move a little. Lill-Märta, I know! We plant your tree! Shall we not do that? - We plant Lill-Märta's trees! - Yes! Come on, we'll get it. This is it. - It has traveled all the way. Look. - It is completely destroyed. No, it's really nice. It's a little sad, but it does not matter. - Look. - I'm also freezing a bit. Come on, this way. Here! Here I think. Right in front of the house that father is going to build. - Come on! Lill-Märta, come on. - Little Marta, come on! Lill-Märta, come after me. Here, absolutely. - I can guard Harald. - Oh, how kind you are. Do you remember Grandma's apples? Va? Astrakhan apples! - Do you think that something will grow on it? - It is clear that it will grow. Grandma's apples, the best in the whole world. It is clear that we will get such. - You can hope... - We can hope. Good, Johan. - Lill-Märta, come and pat here at the end. Good. Look. How good you were. Mother! Mother! Lill-Märta... stay. Stay there. Stay there! Lill-Märta, you have to run and get Dad. You have to pick up Dad. Hurry up. It's my child. Take what you want. Get out of here, please. Please, get out of here. Please, get out of here. Please... not the baby... It's my baby. Are you unharmed? Did they scare you? Are you unharmed? - So. Here. Get Ulrika. Get her. I need Ulrika. Get her! The baby is coming. Marta, take care of the little ones. I have to go to Taylor's Falls. It will be fine. It hurts a lot, but it will go well. The baby will be out soon. - Are you afraid? - No. Just a little confused. I understand that. Just sit there, it will be nice. Dad's probably coming soon. What's going on? Help me! Lill-Märta! What should I do? Mother? Mother! Wake! Wake! Father!! Here. Give me her. Kristina... Karl Oskar! Burn a knife, get some water. Water... Kristina, I... Little trick. So. Her name will be Ulrika. But what's the name? She should be called something American, right? - Grace is fine. - No. Ulrika. You... Mister Abbot is free. Mister Abbot? The merchant? Yes. He's not much to look at. He smells like a man, but... he can feed both me and Elin, so... - But you do not like him. - He's all right, I guess. Jaha... Lill-Märta! Johan! Now it's bedtime. The bread lasts for two days. Johan has eaten breakfast for three. Can not stay a few days? It does not have to be that long. Just a little while. You are welcome to stay for me. I'm sorry. I have to go back to the store. Mr Abbot does not like when I'm gone. No, of course. You... You are strong. Stronger than you think. We are the tree that stands alone on the plain. The tree that topples in the first storm. - Kristina... - Mm. We'll just make it through the winter, it's going to get better. You'll see when it's done. When we are done with the house, it will be different. Who knows, we might even buy an oil lamp. You... We're the best friends, aren 't we? The goast. He breaks ground. Chopping and digging. Chops and overturns. River up with root and tuber. Here he gets to be his own priest and his own commander. Can one be caught in another's freedom? Lill-Märta? You should take care of her. Lill-Märta! Little old lady, hey. Are you sitting here all by yourself? Lill-Märta? Mother! Mother! Harald poops. - Mother! Mother! There are people in the forest. - People? - They're coming here. - Where's Dad? Karl Oskar! Karl Oskar! Hide, hide! So. Sit here now. Still. Hello? Is anyone there? Hello? Hello? Do not come... Do not come closer, because then I will shoot! Kristina? Judith? Kristina! What are you doing... Judith! What are you doing here? What are you doing here, Judith? Kristina, good day. Nice to see you. - We've got neighbors. - And look at me, as I look. Kids! Come and say hello. Unfortunately, the Wisconsin Congregation was already in ruins. Corrupt? This country and the freedom to vote for whoever you want as president, that's one thing. But that they themselves should decide the way to bliss... We've heard of a Baptist in Taylor Falls. Many Swedes join him. Henry Jackson, a good man. This country is full of sectarians. They preach joy and love, but they are Satan's messengers. Jackson is said to have cheated on an old lady - - to bequeath his entire fortune to him. Is Pastor Jackson a sectarian? Yes, they can be seductive. You have to be careful. Really. - Rabbit meat? - No thank you, dear. We have five Swedish families with us. A small congregation. - Name, huh? - Yes. Karl Oskar, it will be like a little Sweden out here. Some compatriots live in Taylor Falls too, don't they? - Yes it does. - Anders Månsson, Fina-Kajsa's son. And Samuel Nöjd, his neighbor. A fur hunter. - And then Ulrika and Elin, of course. - Horan? She's a much better person now. Much better. You will like her. When was the last time you received communion? - That... - We have not had the opportunity. No. You have so much to stand for. I'll send some men, and they'll help you with the roof. - Thank you, but... - Of course. Of course we will help each other. Thanks. Imagine that we meet again. The Lord has been gracious to us. He has given us a second chance. Grace is also greater in America. Hey! How nice you have brought. - Judit! Hi. - Hello. - I can take her. - Now you can come to Judit. Now we deserve a break, gentlemen. - It's a little faster now. - It's going to be great. Hi. Be careful now. How fast it goes. He gets involved in everything. The world does not perish just because you receive some help. Next time, you will help them. Right? Come on! Here it will stand, in the name of Jesus Christ. Our Swedish Lutheran Church. We are far from home, but we will find our home. With God. It is only if we hold together in God that we can resist sin. Together we can build the new country. Churches, schools, shops - anything is possible. In the spirit of God and with the power of God. Amen. Hallelujah! Who will pay for all this? And who will build this church? - Fin predikan. - Thank you, Kristina. Lill-Märta. Let's see... - What do you have with you? - You will see. - So that she can cover her hair. - Men Judit... I hope it fits Lill-Märta. How beautiful it is. Thousand thanks. Thanks. Have a seat. - What wonderful kids. - Then you would see when they quarrel. Yes, you are truly blessed, dear little Kristina. Thank God for that. Is it you? Oh! Ulrika! - As I have missed you. - And I've missed you. - Far too long. - Too long ago. Surely he's nice? I rode here all by myself. - Good day, Judit. - God's peace. Are you going already, Judit? Wait... - Do you hang out with her? - She's been a good friend of mine. I'm not going to blame you, but you've been seduced. - That woman is ruined. - She's living another life now. She is to marry the merchant Abbot, a good Christian. - The American merchant? - Yes exactly. If it's not whore, then I do not know what. God wants mercy, right? As long as you are a good person, so... Kristina, we are Swedes, Lutherans. Shall we hang out with whores and sectarians? Shall we start tossing around with those skirts, hats - - just because we are in a new country? You're confused. Think of them back home. Think of your mother. What would she have said? Worst thing she got in a hurry. Maybe the rumor has reached here before me? What reputation? There will be a wedding in the spring. - So he was serious, Mr Abbot? - Yes, I'll tell you that. What can I say, Ulrika? He certainly wants to give you a good life, do not you think so? Mm. But... I said no. - Will there be no wedding? - Yes, I want to say that. But what do you mean? What happened? Va? Tell me! Tell! Pastor Henry Jackson. Look! He came into the store and bought candy sugar and turnips - - and he stole my heart, Kristina. That man can preach! You should have heard him. - Pastor Jackson? - Imagine, Gladan is going to be a priestess. But Ulrika... he's a Baptist. Yes. I will be too. - Are you not happy? - Jo... Yes I am. I am very happy. It's going to be a real American wedding, and I'll be wearing a white, long dress. - White? - Yes. And you should be the guest of honor. - Is it spring? - Mm. I do not know if I can in the spring. You know, I'm still breastfeeding. You always breastfeed. Bring the kid and Karl Oskar - the whole crowd. Everyone can come. Well... - Is it the priestess you are afraid of? - No I am not. Is it for her sake that you've wearing that awful black hat? He is a Baptist, Ulrika. Baptist. Do you know what it means? Olaussons intends to put Karl Oskar on the church council. Karl Oskar, he too, huh? I'm not sure you understand this. You're ashamed of me. Of course I'm not ashamed of you. After all we've been through together, so... are you sitting here lying to me right in the face. Have you told your Baptist who you are? Va? Did you tell him that? - Fy fan. - We do not swear in my house. I swear as much as I damn well please. May God forgive you. I do not need your fucking prayers. I do not need you. I do not need any of you. Ulrika... - I do not need anyone at all. - Ulrika... Year after year with bread on the table. Mile after mile of cultivated land. Same sun. Same heaven. A small Sweden in America. Are we here now? Are we home now? Good, Lill-Märta. Look, what nice carrots. Now comes the priest. What a stately school it will be. If you continue at this pace, the boys can start school already in the spring. - Just the boys? - Lill-Märta, we do not talk like that. The girls are welcome to read the catechesis with Judit. Everyone should learn to write, right? And English, they have to learn English, right? Everything has its time. And everything that happens under the sky has its moment. - What the hell is that supposed to mean? - Karl Oskar! The women of the church should be silent, for they have no right to speak - - and must submit, as the law says. And if they want to learn something, they ask their men. Amen. The women read the catechesis and take care of their children - - just as we have always done in Sweden at all times. Now we are not in Sweden anymore. The church council has decided that. With such strong opinions, you should have attended the meetings. Americans teach both their boys and girls. Nilsson might want to send his girls to common school, to become little American shoes? Sure, why not? My youngest daughter was born here. You oppose God's will, Karl Oskar Nilsson. God or the priest? I have been ordained a priest in the spirit of God. Do you question that? I put them in common school. - And you decide that? - Yep. I decide that. - Do you want to say something to yours? - You only get health. Do you have something to tell me? We have built on the barn and... we have put corn. It's been so long. Do not you think she wants to hear from you? You can write about the Queen of the Prairie. Write that we have been given a stove called the Queen of the Prairie. - Yes, you can, can you? - Mother does not care about a stove! Kristina... Fine. But write that we are hardly welcome in the church. That the neighbors shun us. That the children should start in common school. Write it, you! Then she will surely be happy. I just think it's wrong. We are Swedish. Stop now, damn it! Do you see this house? Do you see this house ?! I built it for you. The food in the cupboards in there, the winter storage in the barn - everything is for you! But you just whine and complain and nag about Sweden. Sweden was stone, Kristina. Did you forget that? Stone and starvation. Yes, but I was someone in Sweden. I was someone and we belonged. Oops! Kristina, stay. Stay. You're bleeding. - Va? - You're bleeding. The child... - Yes, now she had use for me. - Mr Nelson... Tell your wife that you immigrants must stop multiplying like rabbits. Thanks. Thousand thanks. You're devastated down there. Yes, that applies to you too. She can not bear to have children again. I do not understand... It is easy. You should leave her alone. The next cot will be her death. - Ulrika? - I find out for myself. I'll split it for you. You can keep the corner, you feel so good there. I have some good planks in the shed... Mi... s... Mist... er... Nel... son. - Mister Nelson? - Mm. You read better than a priest even before school starts. "Mister Nelson", who is it? It's father. Nelson? Do you let people call you that? Va? Mr Nelson. No, but sit there and keep quiet, then. That's all I get nowadays. Silence. Silence from Mr Nelson. The American from Korpamoen. Come to mother. Come on. Come on. Kristina... It destroyed my tree. - That beast destroyed my tree! - It's just a deer. You... It's a little exposed. Maybe we should plant it closer to the house. It's not just about replanting, do you not get it ?! You can not just dig up and dig down anyway! The roots can not stand it! Where are you, God? Why do you continue to punish me? If you exist, then why not show the way? I also want to go to school! - You are too small. - Or how, Dad? - Yes. I can help you in the team yard when we get home. Take something to eat. Well, you can say something. Please. All right. Marta, you can stay at home with mother. - I'm going to school. - No. - I'm coming! - I have changed my mind. Do as I say. - I'm going there! - Now you do as I say! Jump down! - You... - Do not talk to me. It's for your own good. Do you know what's best for me? Have you asked me? - You will understand when you get older. - You're just jealous. It's just because you can not write yourself. - In with you now. - No. - Now you do as I say! - I hate you! - What is it? - I can not find Märta. She ran out into the woods. Karl Oskar went away with the boys. Someone has to look. - Peter is at a meeting with the congregation. - You can help me. - I do not know when Karl Oskar will come... - She will come when she gets hungry. - Come, we go in and pray for her. - Be? It is God who teaches your Marta a lesson. She has been proud. - But she's just a child. - We all have to learn from our mistakes. I'll find her myself. Take care of Ulrika. - Kristina... - Take care of Ulrika! Kristina! Marta? Marta! Marta! Marta! Mother! Marta? - Marta! - Mother! Mother! - Marta... - Mother! Hello my friend. Are you stuck? I will help you. Pull the leg back. My friend... I carry you. Have we not been here before? Look. We need help. Stay there! Thanks. Do you think they live here? I do not know. Thanks. Are they? Father! - Are you unharmed? - Yes. - I've sprained my foot. - Oh, what a commotion. Thank you, Lord my God, who laid his hand on them. - What is she wearing? - We got help from the Indians. - Va? - My God, remove it. Take it away! It was a gift. You have been seduced. - Come, I'll help you. - She keeps it if she wants. - I will help you. Do you not hear what I say, Judith? Marta decides for herself. - She's a child. - Yes, and I'm the baby's mother. - She's lost. - Am I lost? We're all tired. Thank you, everyone. The devil has taken your soul. Peter, say something. It's the whore's fault. Gladan i Ljud. - Everyone knows she's running here. - Ulrika? Beware of this fallen woman. Have no desire for her beauty. She helped me when I needed it. And do you know why? She is my friend. - Ulrika is my friend. - Petrus... And these are my children. And they can dress and behave exactly as they wish - - as long as they have the goodness of God in their hearts. Do you all hear that? Do you hear that! - Can you silence your woman, Nilsson? - No, I do not think I can. This house is unclean. It must be purified! Orent? Is this my house you're talking about? Get away from here. Disappear! Yes, there they were told everything. I want to be your wife again. We can not. No, we can not. No, the doctor said we can not. The doctor is wrong. I am not afraid. - Then I must be afraid of you. - No you can not. God helps the one who helps himself. Is not that what you usually say? I want you. Is not that enough? Can I be of service? Ulrika. Mrs. Jackson. Just a moment. Wife? It's a lady looking for you. What do you want? You're the best thing that has ever happened to me in this country. Yet I betray you. I do not deserve anything. But if... you now mean that everyone deserves a second chance, then... I want to ask you that. I miss you. Maybe you need me too? Sorry. It was not meant to disturb. Sorry, Mrs Jackson. Oh really? Kristina from Duvemåla niger for Gladan. I have never looked at my husband! But come in, then! Welcome. You know, I have something for you. Follow. Come on. Come now. - This! - Are you mad? No. This one will be perfect. - Name... Karl Oskar is coming soon. - He has to wait. - Now you're going to a tea party. - It's way too much. No Please. I've missed you! You tell. How is school going? - It's fine. English is fun. - Mm. - But geography is most fun. - Geography? The doctrine of the world, you know. Continents and stuff. Continents, va. We do not care about them. Come on. Mom, are you okay? No... No... Cot fever. I was trying to warn you, sir. Her body is too fragile to carry more children. - There must be something you can do. - I'm sorry, madam. We can only hope and pray. Hi, dear... you... I thought... Do you think... that you can help me... to write a letter? To grandma, in Sweden? Mm. Now we'll write to Grandma, whether she wants to or not. What are we going to write, then? Dear mother... Dear mother. Once we were one. Once I did not know where I started and you stopped. So you do not regret, then? We're the best friends, right? Your apples have ripened. Is it true? I want to see. Karl Oskar, I want to see! It tastes like home. Forgive me, mother, but I do not regret it. Once I did not know where I started and you stopped. Now I know. Now I'm home. Can we continue? Mother? Mother? My mother, Kristina Nilsson, died on August 27, 1856. She never had time to finish writing this letter. It's me, Lill-Märta, who put the pen to the paper. I go to school and can read and write, both in Swedish and English. Mom really wanted to get a letter from you. She always said that we must not forget where we came from. Maybe you can send one to me? A letter from Sweden. I will never forget her. She's the bravest I know. Subtitles: Ulrika Jansson Båving Swedish Media Text
