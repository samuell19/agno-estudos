Ain't a pretty picture, is it, bitch? [ Birds chirping ] WOMAN: David? What? David! What, Susan? What?! This! These! I mean, it's bad enough working at the damn prison without you having to dig up all this stuff! Are you having another one of your nightmares? They're not my nightmares. They're your nightmares. You're having... my nightmare? Don't poke fun! Come here. I'm sorry. All right. Now. It's just... It's just research for the execution scene that I have got to write. Okay? It's a dream. It's a bad dream, and it'll go away. I bet I know what you've been dreaming about. I think we'd better do a little investigative reporting right now. - [ Alarm ringing ] -RADIO DJ: But before we get to that, let's check the traffic for ya. Oh, shoot! Why don't you write something funny? Write a love story. It's the '80s, Susan. Love isn't funny! [ Screaming ] [ Continues screaming ] Jesus Christ! Will you get off my ass? DIRECTOR: Cut! What do you think this is, the Olympics, huh? Sharon, darling, can you, in all honesty, call that running? Bobby, my smock was too tight. Yesterday, it was too loose. All right, once more, please! First positions! Rewire? Huh? Are you ready? Umm... Yeah. Okay, let's do it! NEWSCASTER: And in Washington, the White House flatly denies all allegations. WOMAN: Uh, give me a short stack and a side of bacon. Locally, the glamour and intrigue surrounding the arrival of a movie production company has given way to rumor and suspicion. WAITRESS: A couple of -- Hollywood's Greystone Productions is now filming in the abandoned state penitentiary. WAITRESS: Two sailors on a raft, Fingers. NEWSCASTER: ...which was destroyed in the riot 18 months ago. More coffee, sir? NEWSCASTER: However, the film's screenwriter, David Harris, claims his research for the movie's script has uncovered the real reasons for the inmate revolt. What caused the riot here was... ...brutality... ...inhuman conditions... ...corruption. DAVID: What went on at this prison was abominable. And I think the major ring leader of that is... is Warden Karsh. And he's someone that's going to have to pay for what happened here. NEWSCASTER: The riot was the worst in the nation's history, resulting in the deaths of 13 guards and 37 inmates. It began following the execution of serial killer, Ivan Moser. Moser was convicted of the torture-slaying of 23 people, including game show hostess Susan Starr. [ Cab engine starts ] Hey, bud! You going in there? I got a delivery. You want to sign, please? I've been waiting here a half an hour for someone to show. Why didn't you just take it in yourself? I wouldn't go into that place. That place ain't right. -It ain't been right since the riot. -What about the, uh, delivery? Harris. Oh, my God. Malone! [ Chuckles ] So, uh... Is it, uh, necrophilia when you do it with a dummy or somethin' else? In your case, David, sex with a dummy would be called masturbation. You're just... Ooh! Nice butt! You're just jealous, and you can just stay out here with your jealousy. -You just stay...! -Ooh! Nice butt! Hold this, will ya? You know, you two look a lot like the Hamilton sisters. The who? You know, Mary and Terry, the Siamese twins, joined at the hip since birth. They spent, umm... They spent two years over on death row. Siamese twins spent two years on death row? Yeah, it turns out, that, uh... Mary was the jealous type. Found out that her boyfriend was having an affair with another woman and slit his throat. As she should have. It's no joke, Malone. They gave her the death penalty. So, what about Terry? Was she innocent? Umm, not exactly. Turned out, she was the other woman. Get out of here! Kiss your dummy. There's your other woman. Uh-huh. What's the matter, Malone? You lost your sense of humor? David, nothing's funny after three weeks in this place. Eh! Come on! Come on! A couple more stunts, and you're a free woman. Other than the life sentence I'm serving with you. [ Malone chuckles ] 2ND ASSISTANT CAMERA: Scene 96. Take 5. Action! [ Gasping ] [ Guns click ] Cut! Rewire, you... ...you are just... testing my patience, aren't you? No, no, no. I got it! I got it! I got it. Umm. I got one here. And I got one... ...here. [ Squib fires ] Bobby! MAN: I'm gonna get your ass. [ Chuckles ] DAVID: Hey, Russell. Your girlfriend's here. Say... ...that thing looks just like Ms. Fox. This thing thinks just like... Ms. Fox. -Does it have, uh...? -MALONE: Does it have a what? You know, uh... ...tits and everything? And everything. KARSH: Russell! Come here, damn it! -Oh, shit! -KARSH: Russell! DAVID: Russ, you oughta get that gate fixed. Whoa. Easy jump, first up? I'm not sure. Call sheet? Tanning salon, Tommy? Just checking the toner. Sure you were, Tommy. It looks just like Fox. [ Grunting ] Russell saw her first. Well... So, does it have tits and everything? I'll leave you gentlemen to your own investigation. [ Crinkles paper ] -See you on the set? -Mm-hmm. Promise? Yeah, promise. Uh, this must be where the batteries go. KARSH: Dammit, Russell! Let me in! I'm the goddamn warden! Was the goddamn warden. I heard that! Listen, I could kick your ass, then. I can kick it now. Final review board can change that. You understand? I ain't got no quarrel with you. The only thing you ain't got is any sense. Jesus, I swore I'd never set foot in this place again. -Well, where are they? -Who? The movie people. Who'd ya think? Well, where are they? Up on D-Block. I cleaned it up. A little. -[ Doll squeaks ] -[ Malone gasps ] Funny, you guys. Very funny. Harris, I know you're behind this. Harris? [ Heavy breathing ] DISTORTED VOICE: Harris? [ Heavy breathing continues ] FOX: No! Asshole! ROBERT: Cut! You know, according to this, we are doing scene number 94 from Death House Dolls. I see no mention of the Marx Brothers or Larry, Moe, and Curly. Yeah, you should have got some guys that could kick ass, not squish it. It also says in here that I am the director, Ms. Fox! -Yeah, but these guys -- -What is it about this scene? The emotions too vague? The writing too complex? Not enough four-letter words in it for her? Oh, yeah? Well, this ain't easy! You try letting these squibs paw all over you! When was the last time you guys got laid? When was the last time you didn't? Prick! Brilliant! We should be getting this on film. Bobby! Bobby, I got bruises! My agent is gonna hear about this. I'm supposed to be working with actors, not sexual offenders. Oh, and you Harris. You pervert. How do you dream up this stuff anyway? You know, this wasn't a dream, Sharon. You should take a look around. - [ Pouring coffee ] - It was a nightmare. 1,400 inmates tried to burn this place to the ground. 1,400 animals. Warden, I'd like you to meet our star... Ms. Sharon Fox. Ms. Fox, your last movie was one of my favorites. -Oh... -Thank you, Warden. This movie just doesn't seem like... like your style. Well, it's not my style. But then, uh, style doesn't always pay the bills, so I'm forced to do crap... ...like this. Ah, but well-written crap, my dear. Harris... crap is crap. Mr. Harris... I hear you've been asking questions about the riot. HARRIS: Umm. Yes, I have. A little background for the script. Background? You talkin' about a movie, boy. What happened out here was real. What happened out here was never real clear. -Harris! -KARSH: Clear? Why, it was plain enough to those who lived through it. -Just who did live through it, Warden? -Harris. Special effects needs that dummy, now. Let me tell you something, boy. The state let you use my prison to make your little movie, but the riot that took place out here is none of your business. And I don't want anybody questioning my men about it, understand? We understand, Warden. Mr. Harris, do you understand? [ Sighs ] Yes, I understand. I don't want to have to come back out here. Better luck on your next picture, Ms. Fox. Now listen to me, Geraldo. We are here by permission of the state board, one of whose members happens to be Warden Karsh. Frankly, I could give a shit if the famous riot was his fault or the Pope's. We need these prison scenes, so stay out of his eyeline. Capiche? Capiche. And get the dummy down to Rewire. [ Crew chatting ] [ ''Kiss My Stinky White Ass'' by Boomer plays ] Hey, is that you, Barry Manilow? ♪ Kiss my stinky white ass ♪ ♪ Kiss my stinky white ass ♪ ♪ Kiss... my stinky white... ♪ Hey, you got the doll! Looks nice! It's got front and rear joystick ports. [ Electric buzzing ] - So, how's...? Oh, shit! Goddamnit! Hey, live feed, man. 2,000 volts! Do not touch! Rewire, do you have any idea what 2,000 volts will do to you? No, you got any pictures? All right, just imagine, uh, hooking a parakeet up to your car generator. I'd better turn it off. Good idea. [ Turns off power ] REWIRE: Hey, I got something for ya. I scraped it off the floor with a screwdriver. I can't wait. Belonged to the last guy that got fried here. Rewire, this is Ivan Moser's boot! Thought his ashes might be in there. Hey, you know, if we could find the other one... ...we'd have a pair. We might even find Ivan Moser. I doubt it. No, maybe he's like that guy in the Halloweens! He keeps getting killed, but Bobby Ewing's wife keeps waking up! So he doesn't know if he's dead or just dreamin'! Maybe he's like that? Umm... Malone's just about to make her jump. I'd better get back. Good talkin' to ya. [ ''Kiss My Stinky White Ass'' continues playing ] Forgot your boot! [ Water dripping ] [ Heavy breathing ] [ Humming ] [ Heavy breathing continues ] Whatcha doin', boy? Boy? Hey! Jesus Christ, get away! [ Yelling ] KARSH: Get away! Hey! [ Yelling continues ] Help! Not me! No! Help! Help! [ Screaming ] Okay. We'll use an 18 on this and shoot it at 48 frames. Fine. [ Crew catcalling ] Hush. Yes, a star is cloned. [ Chuckling ] All right. All right. That looks fine. 10 bucks says you miss the bag. Let's try to get this today, shall we? Leave! ROBERT: All right. Lamp! She's gonna break away from the guards, run over to the rail, jump off into the logging truck below. You're gonna pan with her to the rail. Okay? -CAMERAMAN: All the way. -How's it look? It looks too easy! Why don't we get Fox to come up here and do it? All right. Let's make this. FOX: Oh, I love the hair, Malone. It's much better than your own, don't you think? Now, all you need is some tits! [ Sizzling ] Okay, we'll do this! I'll call action, and Malone steps in for Fox. Sure you don't wanna jump? Oh, I don't have to jump. I get paid to act. Oh, that's what you call that? ROBERT: All right! Roll it! Jesus, not since Crawford and Davis in Baby Jane. Who? 2ND ASSISTANT CAMERA: Scene 101. Take 1. Action! Just you and me now. Freeze! Action! [ Crew lightly cheering ] [ Crew clapping ] [ Malone gasps ] Oh! [ Giggling ] That was great! Okay! Quick insert of hands on the rail, and then everybody over at the chair in 10 minutes. [ Crew murmuring ] [ Malone laughing ] -What a star! What a star! -Yeah! That was great, Malone. That was great! CREWMAN: Let's get ready for the next set up. The power companies wouldn't let public juice be used to fry inmates. So prisons have their own generators. Now, I tied the direct current... ...into the dummy. But we can't control it, so... the feed will surge or sag depending on the power available. Thank you. And in English, what does that mean? I don't know. We may get nothin' or totally fried. FOX AND HARRIS : Fried? FOX: No way, Bobby, we are not gonna kill her. Oh, no chance! The inline fuse will blow before anything happens to the doll. Hey! You get your hands out of there! All right. All right. Let's... Let's make this. Roll, please! Scene 131. Take 1. Some people dream things and say, ''Why not?'' I dream things and say, ''Whoa, where am I?'' Quiet, please, we're rolling. [ Electrical buzzing ] This is great stuff. Did you write this? [ Sizzling ] Stop! She's dying! [ Sizzling continues ] Let's save it! FOX: Bobby! -Save it! -FOX: Bobby! Bobby! Turn it off! FOX: Oh, Bobby, look at her! [ Electricity surges ] [ Fox screams ] ROBERT: Turn it off! FOX: Bobby! What happened? The tungsten element must have been bogus. What happened to the power? What I told you. The chair caused a power surge and blew the main circuits. You told me that? [ Harris clears his throat ] You guys seemed to be locked in. Well, so are you, man. The locking system automatically seals the prison during a power failure. Except it only works on two doors anymore. This one and the main entrance. So what are we gonna do now? Somebody's gotta go down to the boiler room and reset the auxiliary. I'll lead ya. Okay. Hello, do you hear me? REWIRE: Okay, just take the elevator all the way down. Isn't this thing electric? Hmm. -Uh, Rewire, isn't this thing electric? -[ Elevator turns on ] REWIRE: It runs on emergency power, man. Except for when the cable slips. Maybe you guys should take the stairs. [ Elevator hits bottom ] [ Harris grunts ] REWIRE: Okay. Welcome to the dungeon. Just take a left, follow the railing. What are these lights? Highway flashes. They used to make 'em. David, why are they still on? Rewire, these flashes are still on down here. REWIRE: Yeah, it's like being inside a pinball machine. Yeah, why are they on? REWIRE: Russell must be afraid of the dark. I thought they made license plates in prisons. You've been watching too much TV, Malone. Watch your step. REWIRE: Okay, dudes. Wait, yeah. Come back? REWIRE: Look for the power access. Uh, I don't see anything that even remotely resembles that. REWIRE: You must be lost, keep looking for the big storage banks. That's the... [ Metal clanking sound ] Who's there? Russell? Russell? Rewire, there's somebody else down here. Bobby! It's late! We're missing Dynasty! -Probably Malone... -I gotta pee. ...or a catwalk behind the storage tank. Take it over to a little rusted ladder. Head down, and you're there. Watch that drop off. [ Whistles ] Ladies first! Children first! Here, hold this. Ow! Shit! -Watch that thing. It's really sharp. -MALONE: Okay. Whoa! Harris? David, what happened? Oh, God! David, what happened? [ Water sloshing ] David! Oh, shit! -[ Rat screeches ] -DAVID: Malone! DAVID: There's rats down here! Hurry up! David, are you okay? Smells like a goddamn sewer in here! It is a goddamn sewer. [ Chuckles ] How ya doin', boy? Come on. Let's get him out of there. You mean, there's shit down here? [ Rats squeak ] Hurry up! DAVID: Get me out of this place! [ Rat squeaks ] Gah! [ Water sloshing ] [ Rats squeak ] All right. What the hell is this place? That... ...is Moser's hole. Solitary confinement. Warden Karsh had it built special... for Ivan. Uh, Ivan Moser. [ Generator revving up ] What do you mean, Karsh built it for Moser? Don't hit that cable. It's live. That'll warm you up real good. The warden's got a little explaining to do. You son of a bitch. You had it comin'! You're an asshole since the day you were born. I hope them rats eat your eyeballs, you filthy bastard.

I'm innocent! -FOX: Stop! -Cut! Listen, ladies. There is no Miss Congeniality Award here. This is a prison film, and you are alleged actresses. But... ...pretend... ...pretend that you've just broken a nail or that, uh.... that Playboy just discovered some porno films from earlier in your career. But, like, give it... something, okay? Oh, God. Okay. Once more please! Hmm. No. Yes. What are you doin'? I'm trying to get this stunt to work. MALONE: These handcuffs are supposed to come apart. Eh! Come on, Malone! You don't want to be a stunt woman. Marry me. Leave all that behind ya. Come on. I could... I could do it, right here. Right here, Malone. Right now. For eternity. Give me your hand. Does that mean ''yes''? We could live together first. We already do live together. Come on, I was just thinking about something more... ...more permanent. Something for life. You got it! Wait a min... Not this permanent! Malone! Come on. Malone! So, where are the extra prison guards? The agency won't send anyone else over until we've paid. Those rat-hearted bastards! I got you a real prison guard. -What's his name? -Russell. Russell! -ROBERT: He's perfect. -TOMMY: He hasn't acted before. Christ, there's nothing to acting, it's just following directions. Isn't that right? Officer? Can I help ya? Well... Look who we got here. New career, Russell? Uh, the film... Have you seen Warden Karsh out here today? Today? No, not today. He was here yesterday. Well, that's odd. Because I saw his convertible parked out back. Warden's car? You sure? Maybe he came back this morning. I bet, I know, where we can find him. Come on. ROBERT: Lift you chin. Up! Up! Up! Stop! Okay, let's make this. Hold on a second. I need a sound level. Say something. Will you hurry the fuck up, and where the hell is what's his name? I need him in the next shot!

He's down here. We'll be there in, you know... just a minute. Trust me. MALONE: Russell? Russell! Harris! I knew it! I knew you were responsible for this. Responsible for what? Responsible for what? Forget it. Malone, what are talkin' about? MALONE: I'm really tired of this, David. RUSSELL: I... I know he's got to be around here somewhere, Officer Callahan. And...

We had the chair already wired for the dummies. I let them shock me first. It was just a little shock. I knew it wouldn't hurt. But we had to... we had to surprise you for the effect. Oh, yeah! Well, I have a better surprise for you! I quit! And you can take Oscar... and shove him up your ass! You're all in on this, weren't ya? And you think it's real funny, don't ya?

Well, you've probably know her best for ''Killer Cabbie'' and... ''Motorcycle Sluts Go Logging.'' Oh, and that all-time classic, ''The 30-foot Bride of Satan''. Satan? Look here, Fingers. We got us a movie star. You know, OI' Fingers is a bit of a celebrity himself. And why's that? Mm-hmm. He threw the switch that fried Ivan Moser and started the whole damn riot. You know, these people been in the old prison goin' on three weeks, Fingers. WAITRESS: Nothing's happened to them. Yet. Hey, Bobby! Where are you guys? [ Garage door motor ] [ Scratching noise ] No!

Right. -Yeah, yeah. -I tried the hotel that you're in. All of Fox's stuff is still in her room. She hasn't checked out, but nobody's seen her. Bitch, I'll kill her for this.

[ Pulls lever ] MALONE: Rewire, I don't like this. If this is another prank, I've had enough. Okay, you got it. Come on up. Rewire? MOSER: Officer Callahan here. There seems to be a problem in the boiler room. [ Maniacal laughter ] It ain't easy to kill Ivan Moser. I tried. I put my fingers on that lever like I always do, and I pulled down. And he jumped back in his chair! He was a rocket, and he was hissin', only he was strapped down. So I gave him a little more juice 'cause I know he was still smilin'. And I could smell his flesh under that hood. And I know his eyes were popping out, but he was still smilin'. So I kicked in a little more. And the power died. So what you're telling me is... ...is that Moser is still alive? I'm tellin' you Ivan Moser is half-alive. [ Gasping ] MALONE: Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! [ Malone groans ] [ Retching ] [ Alarm sounding ] No! [ Huffs ] Okay, so what you're saying is we've got a, uh... a 6-foot 4, 300 pound, maniac serial killer with half his face burned off his head, walking around? -DAVID: Fingers, where does he go? - Where does he go? -DAVID: He can't go anywhere. - He can't go anywhere. -So you're saying that Moser is ali... -I'm saying Moser's alive...
