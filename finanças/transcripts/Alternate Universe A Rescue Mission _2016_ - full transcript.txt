[MUSIC PLAYING] -[MAN 1] UP, UP, UP. -[MAN 2] FACE HIM, SLATE, GO. [MAN 1] GOOD. [GIRL] YOU GET TO WORK WITH AMAZING PEOPLE AND DO AMAZING THINGS. [BOY] IT WAS THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE. [MUSIC PLAYING] [KEYBOARD CLACKING] [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] [PANTING] [LOUD BANG] OW. [SIGHS] [TEACHER] GO ON, MR. WHEELER. UM, WELL, ACTUALLY THE CAMERA OBSCURA'S AN OPTICAL DEVICE. SORT OF LIKE THE GRANDFATHER TO THE CAMERA. SEE, THERE'S A HOLE IN THIS SIDE. I PLACE A PICTURE DOWN... MY DOG. [ALL] AWW... [TEACHER] AND LET US SAVE THE &quot;AW'S&quot; FOR MR. WHEELER'S ACTUAL DEMONSTRATION. SO, LIGHT FROM AN EXTERNAL SOURCE PASSES THROUGH HITTING A MIRROR ON THE OTHER SIDE WHERE THE IMAGE IS REPRODUCED BUT UPSIDE DOWN. BUT THE COLOR AND PERSPECTIVE STAY THE SAME. CAN, CAN SOMEONE GET THE LIGHTS? THANKS. [ALL LAUGHING] WOW, UH, SORRY. CAN SOMEONE GET THE LIGHTS AGAIN? SO, BASICALLY THE POINT IS YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR SELFIE WITHOUT THE INVENTION OF THIS. BEAST. [TEACHER] YES, VERY BEAST AS USUAL, MR. WHEELER. TAKE A SEAT AS WE SHALL NOW SEE IF MISS MARTIN'S SYNAPSES HAVE ALLOWED FOR A NEW BIG BANG TO OCCUR. OR SIMPLY ANOTHER CATASTROPHIC AVALANCHE OF GREAT BRAINS. WOULD YOU CARE TO GRACE THE CLASS WITH YOUR PROJECT? OR WOULD YOU LIKE A PILLOW? [SNORTS AWAKE] I'M SORRY, UH... I'M SORRY. [INHALER HISSES] I HAVEN'T BEEN SLEEPING WELL. YOU SEEM TO BE SLEEPING JUST FINE IN MY CLASS. SORRY. [BOY GROANS, ELECTRIC BUZZING] [WOMAN] ALEXANDRA MARTIN! WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING? [BOY] I WANT MY MOM! COLORING SHLOMO'S DRAGON SCALES. THIS IS A CLEAR MISUSE OF TECHNOLOGY. HEY, HOW ABOUT TEACHERS REALLY LOVE TO GIVE US HIGH-FIVES AND FIST BUMPS? THIS IS AGAINST THE RULES. SOMEBODY VIDEO AND POST THIS! CALL MY LAWYER! [MUSIC PLAYING] I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT TRAVEL IN REGARD TO... GRAND, AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU JOURNEY TO A CONCLUSION. TRAVELING WITHOUT MOVING TO BE EXACT. IF YOU TAKE EISENBERG'S THEORY OF RELATIVES-- I BELIEVE YOU MEAN EINSTEIN'S THEORY OF RELATIVITY? RIGHT, THAT'S WHAT I SAID, UH... HIS THEORY STATES THAT TIMESPACE IS A FABRIC. [GIRL] OH, LIKE, SPANDEX. IF YOU WERE TO FOLD THAT FABRIC, BRING THE LIGHT FROM THERE TO HERE, IT COULD CREATE A WORMHOLE... [GIRL] EW, WORMS? WORMHOLES ARE PURELY THEORY. NOT PROVABLE PHYSICS. ALTHOUGH, I DO WISH YOU COULD TRAVEL THROUGH A WORMHOLE, MISS MARTIN AND BRING BACK A REAL PRESENTATION. BUT I HAVEN'T EVEN DISCUSSED COSMETOLOGY-- I MEAN, COSMOLOGY. TAKE YOUR SEAT, MISS MARTIN. YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO DO YOUR PROJECT ON SCIENTIFICALLY TESTABLE PHYSICS. NOT THEORIES. A &quot;C&quot;, MISS MARTIN. WHY? THIS IS BASED ON MY MOTHER'S THEORIES! AH, MAKE THAT A C-MINUS. OTHER STUDENTS ACTUALLY PUT EFFORT INTO THEIR PROJECTS TO SHOW HOW PHYSICS REALLY WORKS. JUST REGURGITATING WHAT YOU SEE ON &quot;STAR TREK&quot; DOESN'T CUT IT IN MY CLASS. YOU ARE A C-MINUS, MISS MARTIN. AVERAGE... MINUS. OOH, I'M GLAD WE BEAT THE RED COATS. MISS MARTIN. [ROOSTER CLUCKS] [VIDEO GAME SFX] GRAMS, I WORKED REALLY HARD ON MY PROJECT AND ALL HE DID WAS JUDGE. MR. FROTHINGHAM'S YOUR TEACHER. MY TAX MONEY PAYS HIM TO JUDGE. I CAN'T BELIEVE I HAVE YOU IN DETENTION AND YOU SUSPENDED? YOU KNOW HOW I COUNT ON YOU FOR THE AFTERNOON RUSH. THE TATTOOS WERE ONLY TEMPORARY. [MICKEY] FROTHINGHAM IS RIGHT ABOUT ONE THING. I'M JUST AVERAGE. I DON'T FIT IN ANYWHERE. I'M NOT PRETTY ENOUGH FOR THE POPULAR GIRLS. I'M NOT SMART ENOUGH TO BE WITH THE BRAINS. I CAN'T NAME THE CAST OF &quot;STAR TREK&quot; SO THE GEEKS DON'T WANT ME EITHER. I'M A C-MINUS, AVERAGE. -YES. -REALLY? LEAVE ME ALONE, ICKY. [GRAMS] ALEXANDRA, THIS IS NO TIME FOR VIDEO GAMES. [ALEXANDRA] BUT THIS IS TIGER TRAP. YOU HAVE TO LEAD A TIGER INTO A TRAP AND THEN BOOM, HE'S CAUGHT. PUT IT AWAY. AND MICKEY, YOU SOUND JUST LIKE YOUR MOTHER DID AT HER AGE. I'VE READ HER PAPERS, GRAMS, I'M NOTHING LIKE HER. TRUE 'DAT. SHUT IT, SLACKS. ANYTHING FOR YOU, ICKY. THE ONLY THING KEEPING YOU FROM REACHING YOUR MOTHER'S POTENTIAL, MICHELLE, IS YOU. BOTH YOU AND ALEXANDRA ARE FROM THEIR DNA. THEY WERE EXTRAORDINARY PHYSICISTS AND EVEN BETTER PARENTS! YOU KEEP TELLING US THAT, BUT HOW COME IF YOU SEARCH THEM, NOTHING EVER COMES UP? ALL WE HAVE ARE SOME PHOTOS AND SOME OF MOM'S OLD PAPERS. YOU TWO... ARE GROUNDED. GROUNDED? BUT IT'S THE WEEKEND. CAN WE TABLE THIS FOR, SAY, MONDAY MORNING BEFORE SCHOOL? [GRAMS] YOU DON'T WANNA BE TREATED LIKE A CHILD? STOP ACTING LIKE ONE. EVERYONE ELSE HAS PARENTS. AND I'M BEING RAISED BY A ROOSTER. I'M CALLING CHILD SERVICES RIGHT AFTER A SNACK. WORSE DAY EVER. WHEN YOU GET TO BE MY AGE, YOU'VE SEEN A LOT WORSE. HEY, I WANT YOUR MOTHER'S PAPERS BACK, TOO. -BUT YOU GAVE THEM TO ME. -IT WAS A MISTAKE. LEAVE THEM ON MY DRESSER. [SIGHS] SHE'S BECOMING MORE AND MORE LIKE YOU EVERY DAY. [VIDEO GAME SFX] MOW THE LAWN? WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LANDSCAPERS? I'M LOOKING AT THEM. WHY DON'T YOU JUST SEND US TO THE CHAIR? IT'S FASTER. [GRAMS] HERE'S A LITTLE SPOILER ALERT. IT WILL GET DONE MUCH FASTER IF YOU HELP EACH OTHER. ONE DAY, YOU WON'T HAVE ANYONE TO DEPEND ON BUT EACH OTHER. LETHAL INJECTION? BY THE TIME I GET HOME, GIRLS! PLEASE TELL ME THERE'S ANOTHER WORLD I CAN SEND YOU TO. [GRUNTS] [WHEELER] YOU OKAY? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE, WHEELS? YOU'RE PROBABLY BETTER OFF GOING FURTHER DOWN THE BLOCK. THAT'S WHERE ALL THE POPULAR GIRLS LIKE MARISSA LIVE. WHO? OH, RIGHT, SURE. WELL... DO YOU HAVE ANY SAND PAPER? ANYWAY, I'LL ASK AGAIN. WHY ARE YOU HERE? JUST WANTED TO TALK. WELL, AS YOU CAN SEE, I'M A LITTLE BUSY. [LAWN MOWER STARTS] SOMETIMES THEY RUST. MAKE YOU A DEAL. I'LL MOW YOUR LAWN. TALK AFTER? [MUSIC PLAYING] I GUESS A DEAL'S A DEAL. I WAS THINKING ABOUT YOUR CONCEPT. THE TWO M IDEA? TWO M, WHAT'S THAT? TRAVELING... W, WITH... O, OUT... M, MOVING. THE WORMHOLE? SORRY, RIGHT, C-MINUS IDEA. THERE'S NOTHING REMOTELY C-MINUS ABOUT YOU... YOUR IDEA. WHOA! [TICKING] WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT IT CAN PULL THE DISTANT LIGHT TO US BY, YOU KNOW, PULLING THE FABRIC OF SPACETIME, THEN WE COULD STEP INTO THAT LIGHT AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE? RIGHT, SOMETHING LIKE EINSTEIN'S GRAVITATIONAL LENSING. SORTA LIKE A TELESCOPE THAT YOU CAN TRAVEL THROUGH. A WORMHOLE. SORRY, I'M WASTING YOUR SATURDAY. I DON'T FEEL LIKE I'M WASTING MY SATURDAY. HOW, HOW'D YOU... THINK OF THIS? NOT MY IDEA, MY MOM'S. MY GRAMS SHOWED ME HER OLD COLLEGE THESIS. I THINK SHE WAS MY AGE WHEN SHE WROTE THIS. OUR AGE? SHE MUST'VE BEEN A GENIUS. GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE AT 17 FROM PLIMPTON. NEVER HEARD OF IT. REALLY? IT'S THIS HUGE SCIENCE SCHOOL. BETTER THAN M.I.T. OR HARVARD. WELL, WHERE IS IT? I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY. BUT I KNOW IT'S AMAZING. APPARENTLY, SHE BELIEVED TWO M IS POSSIBLE. I ALWAYS HAD THIS FANTASY THAT IF I COULD RECREATE HER PHYSICS THEN MAYBE I COULD FIND A WAY TO SAVE MY PARENTS. IT'S DUMB. NOT DUMB. UM, WHAT, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR PARENTS? THEY DIED IN A CAR ACCIDENT. -THEY WERE BOTH SCIENTISTS? -YUP. BOTH SCIENTISTS, BOTH PHDs, BOTH GONE. [CLEARS THROAT] UM... WELL, UM, SINCE I'M NOT GONE AND YOU'RE NOT, I WAS WONDERING-- -[DOOR SLAMS] -HEY! [MICKEY] WHERE DID YOU FIND THAT? STUCK TO THE BOTTOM OF GRAMS'S DRAWER. YOU WENT THROUGH HER THINGS? SHOULDN'T YOU BE ASKING WHY GRAMS HAS A CRAZY MAD FUTURISTIC BUNNY WATCH INSTEAD? PUT IT BACK. PUT IT BACK NOW! LEX! GIVE IT BACK, ICKY. GIVE IT BACK, ICKY! [SNAP] [BUZZING] A BUNNY. VERSTAG? [WHEELS] WHAT DO YOU THINK IT MEANS? IDK. BUT I THINK I KNOW WHO MIGHT. AREN'T YOU MISSING THE &quot;STAR TREK&quot; MARATHON THIS WEEKEND? PRINCIPAL SHEEHAN, I'M DOING PRECISELY WHAT TEACHERS DO ON THE WEEKEND... -GRADING PAPERS. -THE DISTRICT ANNOUNCED THE NOMINEES FOR THE DIAMOND TEACHER AWARDS. FROM YOUR DEMEANOR, I'LL ASSUME I AM NOT ONE OF THE ANOINTED. THERE'S NO DOUBT YOU'RE THE BEST TEACHER AT SOUTHVIEW. PHYSICS JUST ISN'T SEXY ENOUGH. PHYSICS IS PLENTY SEXY. BUT YOU DON'T WIN THE DIAMOND TEACHER AWARD SITTING IN A CLASSROOM. HAVE A NICE WEEKEND, FITZ. PRINCIPAL-- AH! UH, MR. FROTHINGHAM? DEAR GOD... AGAIN TO GET BACK... -WHOA-WHOA-WHOA-WHOA! -MR. FROTHINGHAM? OH! ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, MR. FROTHINGHAM? AND YOU, WHEELER, I ALWAYS GIVE THE NEW KIDS A MONTH OR SO BEFORE THEY FALL IN WITH THE DELINQUENTS. MR. FROTHINGHAM, I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT YESTERDAY. OH, THAT'S WHAT CHARLES MANSON SAID. [LEX] WHO? WE'RE WASTING TIME, SHOW HIM. OH, OH, MY LUMBAR, AH! MAYBE IT'S ALIEN. YOUR PARENTS WERE WORLD RENOWNED PHYSICISTS, YES? ANY CHANCE YOU WERE ADOPTED? THIS WILL TAKE CAREFUL ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION. TIME I DO NOT HAVE. HERE. WHY DID I EVEN THINK YOU WOULD HELP? VERSTAG? DOES IT MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU? WAIT. IT'S GRAVEST. WHAT? HAVEN'T ANY OF YOU EVER PLAYED WORDS WITH FRIENDS? BY EINSTEIN'S HAIR. IT LOOKS LIKE MOM'S HANDWRITING. MR. WHEELER... WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS? PHYSIC EQUATIONS. YES, YES, EQUATIONS, BUT, BUT DIAGRAMS, AS WELL. -WELL, I SHOULD JUST-- -HEY! IT'S OUR WATCH. YES, OF COURSE. THESE LOOK LIKE EQUATIONS TO BUILD TECHNOLOGY THAT PULLS THE QUANTUM INFORMATION FROM LIGHT CREATING A FOLD IN SPACETIME. LIKE A BLACK HOLE. DON'T BE A CHILD. NO, LIKE A WORMHOLE. EXACTLY. MISS MARTIN... LOOK AT THESE EQUATIONS. SOME ARE PROBLEMS THAT HAVE PUZZLED PHYSICISTS FOR DECADES. SO, DO YOU THINK THESE COULD BE PLANS FOR A LOCALIZED WORMHOLE? DISCOVERY LEADS TO EXPERIMENTATION. [BEEPS OFF] DOES EXPERIMENTATION LEAD TO A NEW GRADE ON MY PHYSICS PROJECT? IT IS NOT YOUR PROJECT. MY PROJECT WAS ON TRAVELING IN REGARDS TO A WORMHOLE. MR. FROTHINGHAM, PLEASE, GIVE ME A CHANCE. BUT IF YOU SO MUCH AS THROW A PIECE OF CHALK AT ME... I PROMISE, NO CHALK. WE BEGIN FIRST THING TOMORROW. WHO ARE YOU? HEY, DOESN'T GRAVEST MEAN SERIOUS OR DANGER? YEAH. WHAT IF IT'S A WARNING? WHAT IF IT DOESN'T WANT US TO BUILD THAT TECH? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? LOOKING FOR... UH, A CAN OPENER. THE CAN OPENER'S IN THE KITCHEN WHERE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN. TOLD YOU, THANKS, GRAMS. [TICKING] [MUSIC PLAYING] WE WILL MEET HERE EVERY DAY DURING DETENTION. BOOM! [MUSIC PLAYING] [CLINKING] [RATCHETING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [WHOOSHING] [CHUCKLING] -IT'S THEM! -MY GOD! -HEY, LEX! -HEY, HEY! THIS IS GREAT! OKAY, MICKEY, THROW IT! TRY AGAIN, TRY AGAIN. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [SNORES] [COMPUTER BEEPING] WAIT, YOU PUT IN THE COORDINATES FROM THE FOOTBALL FIELD, RIGHT? THE ONES YOU GAVE ME, YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. OKAY, BUT WHERE DID ALL THESE OTHER COORDINATES COME FROM? SIMPLEX? MULTIPLEX? [WHEELS] I DON'T, I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE LEX WAS MESSING WITH IT. [WATCH BEEPS] BUT THE ONE SET IS DEFINITELY FOR THE FOOTBALL FIELD. [TEXT ALERT] WE'RE READY. TURN IT ON. [PROJECTOR WHIRRING] MAKE THIS WORK, MISS MARTIN. BY EINSTEIN'S HAIR. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT WORKS. -I CAN'T EITHER. -YEAH. -HOW? -THAT WAS THE COOLEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN. -YEAH. -YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN THE LOOK ON FROTHINGHAM'S FACE. OH, MY... [LAUGHS] [WHEELS] I BET IT WAS A... CONGRATULATIONS, MISS MARTIN. DOES THIS MEAN AN A? AN A? A DIAMOND TEACHER AWARD. WHAT INSIGNIFICANT GOALS. YOU HAVE CRACKED THE HOLY GRAIL OF PHYSICS CREATING A MEANS TO CLOSE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO POINTS. THIS NEEDS TO BE PUBLISHED. WE'RE TALKING NOBEL LAUREATE. NASA MAY EVEN BE ABLE TO USE THIS TO TRAVEL TO OTHER WORLDS. YEAH, SPEAKING OF OTHER WORLDS, LEX, WHAT'S WITH ALL THESE COORDINATES? WOW, I DIDN'T DO THAT. THEY ALL LOOK SO SIMILAR. MULTIPLEX? LET'S TRY ONE. CAREFUL, WE NEED TO TEST THE NEW COORDINATES FIRST. THIS IS ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY. PROVE FIRST OR WE COULD OPEN PANDORA'S BOX. OOPS. [STRANGE SHIMMERING SOUND] THAT DOES NOT LOOK INVITING. DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT GOING IN THERE. GRAMS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? THAT THING YOU BUILT, IT'S A CURSE. MRS. MARTIN, YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER HAS BUILT A WORMHOLE, UNDER MY MENTORSHIP, OF COURSE. -GET OUT. -[MICKEY AND LEX] GRAMS! NO, IT'S NOT A CHICKEN POT PIE. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'VE DONE. THAT THING IS THE REASON WHY YOUR PARENTS ARE GONE. YOU SAID THEY DIED IN A CAR ACCIDENT. I... I'M NOT SURE. THEY BUILT THAT, WE WENT. AND, AND NOW I CAN'T SEE THEM AGAIN. ARE MOM AND DAD IN THERE? -MOM AND DAD ARE ALIVE? -I DON'T KNOW. ALL I KNOW IS THEY'RE GONE. AND NOTHING WILL EVER BE THE SAME. -WE COULD BRING THEM BACK. -DON'T GO NEAR-- [FROTHINGHAM] MISS MARTIN, IT HASN'T BEEN TESTED. DON'T GO NEAR THERE. -ALEXANDRA! -[MICKEY] LEX! I LOVE YOU, GRAMS. GIVE ME 30 MINUTES. LEX?! MICKEY? WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING? YOU HEARD GRAMS! THEY MIGHT BE ALIVE. YOU CAN'T FIND MOM AND DAD. -WHY? -BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST A KID! [LEX] SO ARE YOU! I'M A BIGGER AND OLDER KID! AND UGLIER, TOO. WE'RE MARCHING RIGHT BACK THROUGH THAT DOOR! IF MOM AND DAD ARE HERE, DON'T WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT REALLY HAPPENED TO THEM? COME ON! GOING THROUGH A WORMHOLE AND RESCUING YOUR LONG-LOST PARENTS WILL GIVE YOU STREET CRED. WHAT DOES YOUR POSTER SAY? MY POSTER SAYS A LOT OF THINGS. WELL, PICK SOMETHING. YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE? YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE, THERE YOU GO. WE GOTTA GO BACK. IT'S GONE. [ELECTRONIC VOICE] GRANTED FULL ACCESS UPDATE. I CAN'T BREATHE. [LEX] WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG? MICKEY! OKAY, WE'LL GO BACK! IT'S NOT WORKING. IT'S WORSE. GET HELP. WELL, THE DOOR'S GONE. CALL GRAMS. TAKE HER HERE. THERE'S NO SIGNAL. WHY ISN'T IT WORKING? FIND HELP! I SEE BUILDINGS. I'LL GET HELP, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. DON'T GO ANYWHERE. WHERE WOULD I GO? I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT, I KNOW-- OKAY, OKAY! [COUGHING] [FAINTLY] LEX? [GASPS] [WATCH TRILLING] LEX? [FROTHINGHAM] WELL, IT WAS IN THE NAME OF SCIENCE! SHE, SHE, SHE WANTED, SHE WANTED A BETTER GRADE. DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU JUST CREATED? THEY DIDN'T JUST GO TO A FOOTBALL FIELD. THEY WENT TO ANOTHER WORLD. MRS. MARTIN, I REALIZE THAT MANY WORLDS IS, IS VANILLA PHYSICS. -OH! -BUT, IT, IT'S, IT'S STILL ONLY A THEORY. IT'S NEVER BEEN PROVEN. PROVEN, MY FEATHERS. TELL THAT TO MY MISSING KIDS! THIS IS NOT GOING TO HELP. WELL, COME ON! SHE'S REALLY HURT. I'M COMING, KIDDO, HOLD YOUR HORSES. [MUSIC PLAYING] [FAINT CHATTER] I'M TELLING YOU, SHE WAS RIGHT HERE. MICKEY! STOP HIDING! [MAN] THERE'S NO ONE HERE. [LEX] KEEP LOOKING... SHE COULDN'T MOVE WHEN I LEFT HER. [MAN] WE NEED YOU BACK AT THE BASE. COPY THAT. I'M ON MY WAY. COME ON, KIDDO, LET'S HEAD BACK AND FIGURE OUT WHO YOU BELONG TO. HAVE FUN WITH THAT. I'M FINDING MICKEY. [WATCH TRILLING] LET'S GET YOUR FOLKS ON THE HORN. SOON YOU'LL BE BACK HOME SAFE AND SOUND.

EVERYONE CALLS HER MICKEY. I SAID I WAS LOOKING FOR MY SISTER WHICH IS WHAT I SHOULD BE DOING. HOLD YOUR HORSES, MISSY. MISSY? KIDDO? WHERE'D YOU GUYS LEARN TO TALK LIKE THAT? [WOMAN] ENOUGH OF THE BACK SASS, KID. A FEW MORE QUESTIONS AND THEN YOU CAN SKEDADDLE. WHAT ARE YOUR PARENTS' NAMES? VICTOR AND EVA MARTIN. [MAN] THAT'S A SICK JOKE, KID. DR. VICTOR AND DR. EVA MARTIN'S CHILDREN DIED IN A FATAL CAR CRASH YEARS AGO. [MUSIC PLAYING] A SILVER DISC? THIS IS LIKE SOME ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY. A GIANT DVD. [MUSIC PLAYING] [VERSTAG] HELLO! OUR NEW MODERN LAB WILL POWER MY PARTNERS, DR. VICTOR AND EVA MARTIN -IN OUR JOURNEY TO REVOLUTIONIZE... -MOM AND DAD? [WOMAN] SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. YOU ARE THE DECEASED CHILD OF DR. VICTOR AND EVA MARTIN? NO. BUT, BUT, YES. WELL, I'M NOT DEAD. AM I? BUT, YEAH, THEY ARE MY PARENTS. WELL, WHY DON'T I JUST PICK UP THE PHONE AND ASK YOUR PARENTS ABOUT THEIR GHOST CHILD? WAIT, MY PARENTS WORK HERE? WELL, YEAH, THEY'VE BEEN-- ON SABBATICAL. [PHONE RINGING] YEAH, COLLINGS HERE. UH-HUH. A BLIP? WE'VE HAD SUCCESS BEFORE, BUT THIS NEW INVENTION PUT US ON A WHOLE OTHER LEVEL. WE TRULY BELIEVE WE'RE ON THE PRECIPICE OF PROVING EVERETT'S MANY-WORLDS THEORY. THAT'S ME? BUT HOW COULD THAT BE ME? I CANNOT ASK FOR BETTER PARTNERS THAN MY WIFE, EVA AND MR. VERSTAG. MOM AND DAD WORK FOR THE GRAVEST VERSTAG GUY? WHERE AM I GONNA FIND THIS VERSTAG? WELL, I GUESS I'M IN THE RIGHT PLACE. LOOK, I APOLOGIZE FOR THE GHOST TALK. JUST SIT TIGHT, SWEETIE, WE'RE GONNA FIND YOUR SISTER. -MARTIN'S WATCH. -GRECCO SAID HOLD THE KID. FIRST STEP, WE'LL INDEX. -WHY DON'T YOU TELL US ABOUT-- -I HAVE TO PEE. [MUSIC PLAYING] YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE. WELL, THEN GET HER OUT OF THERE. I'M COMING IN TO CHECK ON YOU! OKAY, LEX, YOU'RE SUPER SMART, THINK. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD BUT WE'RE NOT. SHE SAID VERSTAG WHICH ALSO SPELLS GRAVEST AND CAN'T POSSIBLY BE A GOOD THING. AND MOM AND DAD ARE HERE. THEY HAVE TO HAVE AN OFFICE. THAT'S IT. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO FIND THAT? WHERE'S THAT DAMN KID? SHE'S HEADING FOR THE MARTIN'S OFFICE. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] OH. [VICTOR] YOU HAVE TO HURRY. [EVA] LOOK! LOOK, LOOK. [VICTOR] WE HAVE TO HURRY. ALL THE PLANS ARE DOWNLOADED ONTO THAT WATCH. [CHILDREN LAUGHING] WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER SCIO DEVICE? [VICTOR] GREAT, THIS IS IT, IT JUST NEEDS ENCRYPTION. IT'S ENCRYPTED WITH AN ANAGRAM. THEY'LL HAVE THE PLANS AFTER THE ACCIDENT. -WHAT IF VERSTAG-- -HE WON'T. THE CHILDREN WILL NEVER BE IN THAT TIME. GOTTA FIND LEX. THE GIRLS ARE IN ANOTHER WORLD. SO, THAT'S WHY MICKEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING ON HER PARENTS. AND THAT PLIMPTON UNIVERSITY... THAT'S IN THE OTHER WORLD. COOL. NOT COOL. DANGEROUS. WE NEED TO GET THEM BACK... NOW. AND YOU'RE COMING WITH ME. -ME? -YEAH. IT'S, UH, ME? WELL, MR. FROTHINGHAM, YOU DID ALWAYS WANNA GET OUT OF THE CLASSROOM. SHE CAN'T GET IN WITHOUT THE PASS. OOH!

I WISH MY PARENTS INVENTED A TIME MACHINE. [DOOR OPENING] [DOOR SQUEAKS] [LEX] MICKEY?! WHERE ARE YOU? I NEED YOU. -LEX? -[DOOR CLOSES] -[LOUD CRASH] -OW! OH, MY GOD, MICKEY?! ARE YOU DEAD? OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE DEAD! MAYBE THAT GUARD WAS RIGHT. THAT MEANS I'M DEAD, TOO. [MICKEY] LEX... MICKEY! I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD. -WHY? -BECAUSE THE SECURITY GUARDS CHASING ME SAID THAT WE'RE BOTH DEAD. YOU HAVE SECURITY GUARDS CHASING YOU? -WHAT DID YOU DO? -YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT AGAIN. SHOULDN'T YOU BE ASKING HOW WE DIED? HOW DID WE DIE? IN A CAR CRASH. GRAMS SAID MOM AND DAD DIED IN A CAR ACCIDENT. MICKEY, ALL THE GUARDS ARE WEARING WATCHES JUST LIKE GRAMS'S. I SAW MOM AND DAD. WHERE? ON A SILVER DISC. A SILVER DISC? IT'S A FLAT, TURNING SILVER DISC. [LEX] YOU SAW THEM ON A FLYING SAUCER? NO, NO, NO, ANYWAY, THEY'RE HERE IN A LAB. THAT'S WHAT THE FLYING SAUCER TOLD YOU? SEE? I SEE ALL RIGHT. HOW'D YOU GET THAT WATCH? MICKEY? HOW DOES HE KNOW YOUR NAME? I DON'T KNOW. RUN! THIS IS LIKE BEING IN SEVEN PERIODS OF GYM. GO! THEY'RE HEADING YOUR WAY. HERE, WE'RE DEAD, AND MOM AND DAD ARE ALIVE. WHEN WE FIND THEM, THEY'VE GOT A LOT OF EXPLAINING TO DO. [MUSIC PLAYING] THOSE ARE THE SECURITY GUARDS I TOLD YOU ABOUT. [MUSIC PLAYING] [WATCH TRILLING] DO YOU STILL HAVE A LOCK ON THEM? THEY SHOULD BE RIGHT THERE. [MICKEY] WE'RE IN OVER OUR HEADS. WE NEED HELP. WE DON'T NEED HELP, WE JUST NEED TO GET TO THE LAB. HOW DO WE FIND THEM WITHOUT GPS? A CAMPUS MAP, DUH. I DON'T SEE THEM. [MUSIC PLAYING] [WATCH BEEPS] [MAN] THEY'RE BEHIND YOU. ENOUGH OF THIS CAT AND MOUSE. COME ON, GIRLS, INDEXING DOESN'T HURT. I DON'T THINK THAT'S GONNA WORK WITH MY OUTFIT. WHAT IS THAT BRACELET THING? THEY CALL IT, UH, BEING INDEXED. I DON'T LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT. WE GOTTA GET MOM AND DAD AND GET OUT OF HERE.

WHAT DID HE MEAN, THE WATCH? THEY'RE TRACKING US. [BEEPING] [MUSIC PLAYING] WHEELS, YOU MAN THE THROTTLE WHILE MR. FROTHINGHAM AND I GO BRING BACK THE GIRLS. I'M... I'M NOT REALLY THE ACTION HERO TYPE. [MUSIC PLAYING] A $10 MILLION LAB? IN A BASEMENT? LOOKS LIKE A PRISON. [CLANKING] IT WORKED BEFORE. THIS COULD BE A THOUSAND DIFFERENT NUMBERS. WELL, WELL, JUST THINK. PEOPLE USE PERSONAL REFERENCES. PET NAMES, HOME ADDRESSES. THEIR COLLEGE. [ALARM BLARING] WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. [ALARM STOPS] MY BIRTHDAY? PARENTS ALWAYS USE THEIR KIDS' BIRTHDAYS. YOU REMEMBERED MY BIRTHDAY. OF COURSE. [ELECTRONIC VOICE] ACCESS GRANTED. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CLOCK TICKING] [MICKEY] WE CAME ALL THIS WAY. MICHELLE. EVA, I FOUND THE-- VICTOR. MOM! DAD! OH! OH! WE MISSED YOU. [EXCITED CROSSTALK] LOOK HOW GROWN YOU ARE. OH, MY GOD. OH, LOOK HOW GROWN YOU ARE. [MICKEY] WHY DID YOU LEAVE US?

THOSE RED BANDS. WHAT'S INDEXING? IT WAS A MISTAKE, NO TIME TO EXPLAIN. BY EINSTEIN'S HAIR. [GRAM] WOW. [LEX] GRAMS WILL BE SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU. WELL, WE... WOW, THAT WAS EASY. AH! EVA? MOM?! [RUMBLING] [MUSIC PLAYING] AH, THIS IS WHAT I LIKE. A LITTLE DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY REUNION. -[COLLINGS] INDEX THEM. -[VERSTAG] JA, INDEX THEM. THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL CONCEPT. YOU SEE, YOUR PARENTS' LITTLE INVENTION. THEY DID NOT TELL YOU?! GRAB THE WATCH! [MICKEY] STOP, NO! NO, STOP, NO! [MAN] DON'T STRUGGLE. [VERSTAG] NO-NO-NO, IT'S NICE, I LIKE IT. IT'S FEISTY. AH, MICHELLE, LOOK HOW BEAUTIFUL YOU ARE. SO GROWN UP, I'M SO PROUD OF YOU. YOU HAVE SUCCEEDED WHERE YOUR PARENTS HAVE FAILED. YOU BROUGHT THE &quot;THERE&quot; HERE. WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY BRING THE THERE HERE. MORE LIKE THE THERE... NO, NO... HONG KONG. I USED TO HAVE TO GO THERE. NOW I BRING HONG KONG TO ME. NO LONGER DO I GO TO MARS AND TAKE A YEAR. I CAN GO TO MARS AND BE HOME FOR DINNER. I WILL NEVER LET YOU HAVE IT. PREPARE TO BE DISAPPOINTED. [LEX] NO, MICKEY! [VERSTAG] YOU SEE... SO, YOU SEE, THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH SHORT-SIGHTED THINKING. YOU KNOW? THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS. NOW, LOOK, YOU'RE GOING TO BE INDEXED, YOU UNDERSTAND? I WANT SOMETHING. I WANT THE WORMHOLE, A NEW ONE IN 24 HOURS. YOU UNDERSTAND? -24 HOURS? -YEAH! WELL, YOU CAN TAKE OURS, JUST LEAVE 'EM ALONE. WELL, THEY CAN'T TAKE THE ONE WE BUILT THROUGH ITSELF. YOU SEE, QUANTUM MECHANICS-- NO, NO, NO... I'M TOTALLY... NOW, I HAVE BEEN PATIENT. YOU HAVE BEEN STALLING FOR TEN YEARS. WE'RE NOT STALLING. YOU NEED INCENTIVE? WE JUST DON'T WANNA GIVE IT TO YOU. -BYE, HAZEL. -GIVE IT TO YOU. -NO! -GRAMS? 24 HOURS. GRAMS? [VERSTAG] ENOUGH, ENOUGH. WHERE? NOW WHERE'S THE LITTLE ONE? FIND HER. YOU HAVE BECOME A MONSTER. NO! YOU SEE, I KNOW WHO I AM! IT IS YOU WHO DOES NOT KNOW WHO YOU ARE, PARTNER. NOW TAKE THE LITTLE OLD LADY AND PUT HER IN THE WORMHOLE AND DESTROY IT. 24 HOURS. INDEX THEM. I'LL SEE YOU IN 24 HOURS. YOUR HIS PARTNER? DON'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU HEAR. NO, NO, NO! 24 HOURS IS NOT A LONG TIME. OKAY? AND THEN EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE. I'M TRYING TO MAKE IT WORK, YOU SEE? [VICTOR] WE GOT IT. -GOOD. -24 HOURS. GOOD, NOW GO. YOU SEE? I'M NICE. WHEN I'M NICE, THINGS HAPPEN. GET RID OF IT, GET RID OF IT. GET RID OF THIS GARBAGE. LEX? AWESOME. WHERE'S EVERYBODY ELSE? [MUSIC PLAYING] WHAT WENT WRONG? EVERYTHING. WE KILLED GRAMS. YOU KILLED-- WAIT ON THE OTHER SIDE. I'LL SET THE EXPLOSIVE CHARGE. YOU CAN'T DESTROY IT, I WON'T LET YOU. UH, RIGHT, DITTO. YOU KNOW WHERE THE LAB IS? YOU PEOPLE NEED A PLAN. YOU CONTACT ME THROUGH THE LAB. TURN IT OFF WHEN I LEAVE. WHAT? WHAT'S THAT MEAN? IT'S DONE. AHH... GOOD. WHEN ONE DOOR CLOSES, THE OTHER ONE OPENS, JA? [LAUGHING] AND YOU SAW THE WRECKAGE FROM THE ACCIDENT, JA? -YES. -JA, GOOD, GOOD. IT'S THE SAME CHILDREN, THEY BUILT THE MACHINE, JA? -YES. -JA, JA, EXTRAORDINARY CHILDREN. NOW ONCE THE MARTINS FINISH MY WORMHOLE MACHINE, JA, JA? COME, COME CLOSER. I WANT YOU, BECAUSE YOU ARE MY RIGHT-HAND MAN. NOT YOU, DON'T TAKE OFFENSE. BUT YOU ARE MY RIGHT-HAND MAN. I WANT YOU TO DISPOSE OF THEM, RIGHT, RIGHT? PUT YOUR HAND UP, LET ME SEE, LET ME SEE. YEAH, RIGHT HAND, RIGHT-HAND MAN, THAT'S YOU. RIGHT-HAND MAN, LET'S GO, ONE MORE, FOR GOOD LUCK. RIGHT-HAND MAN.

OH, I ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE HOW THE OTHER HALF LIVED. WE CAME HERE TO FIND MY PARENTS. AND WHAT WE FOUND ARE TWO PEOPLE WHOSE INVENTIONS HAVE DONE NOTHING BUT BRING HORRIBLE THINGS. MY GRAMS... THESE BANDS. THEY'RE AS BAD AS VERSTAG. YOUR, YOUR PARENTS DIDN'T GIVE VERSTAG THE BIG INVENTION. WE DID. BUT IT WAS THEIR PLANS. WELL, YOU CAN'T BLAME THE TECHNOLOGY. A BICYCLE CANNOT GO WITHOUT A PERSON PEDALING. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A BIKE HERE. THEY DESIGNED IT. WE BUILT IT. AND NO MATTER HOW BENIGN, ALL TECHNOLOGY HAS ITS GOODS AND BADS. GRAMS, YOU WERE RIGHT. WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE BUILT THIS THING. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GRAMS] WHAT HAPPENED? ONE MINUTE I'M LISTENING TO THAT JERK VERSTAG, AND THEN I SEE YOUR GRANDFATHER ON THE GREEN HILL. AND NOW I SEE YOU. BUT YOU DIED. I SAW YOU DIE, THEY KILLED YOU. KILL ME? WHY WOULD THAT GUARD GRECCO KILL ME HE DIDN'T KILL ME THE FIRST TIME? NOBODY KILLS ME TWICE. WE GOTTA GET YOUR PARENTS BACK. VERSTAG IS GOING DOWN. [MUSIC PLAYING] WHO WOULD THINK THAT HELPING THEM WITH THEIR PHYSICS PROJECT WOULD GET ME TRAPPED IN THEIR PHYSICS PROJECT? OLIVIER, XAVIER. [SNAPS FINGERS] THIS IS SO BENEATH ME. I COULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT PHYSICIST. NOW I AM A MAIL BOY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? ACCOUNTING. EVER HEARD OF A COMPUTER? JUST GIVE ME MY MAIL. HOW ABOUT EMAIL? [ELECTRONIC WHOOSHING] SORRY. JUST GIVE HER HER MAIL. GOOD LUCK. INSTEAD OF MANUAL LABOR, WE'RE FORCED IN A LIFE SENTENCE OF MENIAL LABOR. YOU'VE BEEN INDEXED. [TYPEWRITER CLACKING] [FROTHINGHAM] PSST. [QUIETLY] WHY DON'T YOU PEOPLE REVOLT? AND LOSE MY BENEFIT PACKAGE? THAT'S GOTTA BE ONE, BLOODY GOOD BENEFIT PACKAGE. PLAN, PLAN? SO, WE'RE HERE AND YOUR PARENTS, MICKEY AND MR. FROTHINGHAM ARE THERE. IF WE COULD GET THEM TOGETHER... THEN WE COULD GET THEM OUT. THAT'S IT. OVER THERE, TWO M IS GOING TO WORK. SORRY, MY PROPS AREN'T IN SCALE. -IT'S THE BEST I COULD FIND AROUND HERE. -AND WHERE ARE YOUR PARENTS? -IN THE LAB. -ARE MICKEY AND MR. FROTHINGHAM AT THE LAB? NO. SO, YOUR PARENTS ARE AT THE LAB. CAN WE POINT THE PROJECTOR TOWARDS THE LAB? YEAH, UH, WITH THE WATCH. [LEX] NO GO. MOM AND DAD ARE WITH THE WATCH. TAKE THAT... AND THE BAD GUYS WILL KNOW FOR SURE OUR TWO M IS WORKING. [GRAMS] SO, WHAT DO WE DO? WE'LL HAVE TO GO THERE AND GET THE COORDINATES FROM YOUR PARENTS. NO. I'LL GO WITH HER. STAY TOGETHER. YOU GUIDE, AND YOU... BRING HER BACK. NOW YOUR PARENTS ARE OUT BUT WHAT ABOUT MICKEY AND MR. FROTHINGHAM? GRECCO... WILL BRING THEM. [LEX] JUST GO WITH IT. AND ONCE EVERYBODY'S IN THE LAB... [WHEELS] WE OPEN OUR TWO M... AND EVERYONE RUNS FOR THE OPEN PORTAL. EXIT STRATEGY. [MUSIC PLAYING] [WHEELS] WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. SO, WE'RE JUST GONNA WALK IN THERE AND GET THE COORDINATES? SHH... THIS IS A BAD PLAN. WE'RE GONNA GET CAUGHT. KEEP YOUR TIGER STRIPES ON. YOU'VE GOT THIS. [GASPS] GET DOWN. GET DOWN. SMALL ADJUSTMENT. LET'S GO WITH PLAN B. PLAN B? [EVA] WE DID WHAT WAS BEST, RIGHT? I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE. WE NEVER WANTED TO GIVE THIS TO VERSTAG. WHY ARE WE DOING IT NOW? IT'S THE BEST WAY TO GIVE THE KIDS A CHANCE. WHEN WE BUILD THIS... YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO DO THE RIGHT THING. [WOMAN] DR. MARTIN? JUST LEAVE THE CLIPBOARD. WE NEED BOTH YOUR SIGNATURES. WE'LL BE BACK TO PICK IT UP LATER. OH... [CHUCKLES] IT'S JUST OUR ORDER. THE KIDS HAVE A PLAN. [BEEPING] [FROTHINGHAM MUTTERING] [CLEARING THROAT] WHAT IS THIS NUMBER? [ROTARY PHONE CLACKING] 8-1-9 7-7-9 9-0. MY FINGER'S BURNING... HELLO. THIS IS VERSTAG INDUSTRIES HERE. IS THE MAN OF THE HOUSE... [DIAL TONE] HELLO? HELLO? I CAN'T DO THIS. I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY DO TO ME. I DON'T CARE. [PHONE RINGING IN THE DISTANCE] ACTUALLY, A CUP OF TEA WOULD HELP. [PHONE RINGING] HELLO, THIS IS VERSTAG INDUSTRIES. I COULD CARE LESS ABOUT DIRECTING YOUR CALL. [GRECCO] LET'S GO. [FROTHINGHAM GROANS] GO. GET IN THERE. [DISTANT TYPING, PHONE RINGING] DO IT, YOU COWARD! YOU ALREADY KILLED MY GRANDMOTHER. HAZEL'S ALIVE, MICKEY. -WHAT? -BE QUIET. SIT DOWN. -BUT WHAT ARE YOU-- -SIT DOWN! WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME. YOUR PARENTS WERE GOING TO TURN EVIDENCE AGAINST VERSTAG. HE FOUND OUT AND ORDERED ME TO KILL YOU AND YOUR SISTER. SO, WE STAGED THE ACCIDENT TO GET YOU TO SAFETY IN THE ULTIMATE SAFE HOUSE. YOUR PARENTS NEVER STOOD UP AGAIN FOR FEAR THAT HE MIGHT FIND YOU. THEY NEVER GAVE VERSTAG THE WORMHOLE TECHNOLOGY. THE PROJECTOR WAS DESTROYED. AT LEAST I THOUGHT IT WAS UNTIL YOU SHOWED UP. THAT'S WHY GRAMS DIDN'T WANT US TO HAVE THE WATCH. WELL, SHE OBVIOUSLY DROPPED THE BALL ON THAT ONE. SO, WE ARE FROM HERE? WHY ARE YOU TELLING US THIS NOW? I NEED YOU TO TRUST ME. YOU INDEXED US! YOU TURNED ME INTO A MAIL BOY. I NEED YOU TO GO WITH IT. STOP STAYING THAT. YOU SAID THAT BEFORE WE JUMPED OFF THE BUILDING. GO WITH IT! YOU SAID THAT TO MY PARENTS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT, DIDN'T YOU? I DID. NOW I NEED YOU TO GO WITH IT. THE OTHER PROJECTOR IS SET TO GET YOU AND YOUR FAMILY OUT OF HERE. AND ME... AND, UH, TOO, RIGHT? [GRECCO] OH, YEAH. I'LL BE BACK TO GET YOU TO THE LAB. WAIT! HOW ARE THEY GOING TO POINT THE PROJECTOR AT THE LAB? I HAVE NO IDEA. BE READY WHEN I GET BACK. [PROJECTOR BEEPING] HURRY, HURRY. YOU GOT 40 MINUTES. YES. MR. VERSTAG IS ANXIOUS ABOUT HIS INVESTMENT. [MUSIC PLAYING] WE'RE TRAPPED. WHAT? DID THEY SEE US? WHAT? NO, DON'T BEND. ACT CASUAL. CASUAL? PROGRESS IS STEADY. YEAH, UH, YOU KNOW, WE'D REALLY HATE TO MAKE A MISTAKE. [WHEELS] CASUAL. OKAY, FORGET CASUAL. RUN. RUN, OKAY. OH! YOU POOR THING, HERE, HERE, HERE, LET ME HELP YOU. OH! SHE HAS A FEVER. MAY SHE HAVE A BREAK? GO, GO. GO! 15 MINUTE BREAK. GO WITH IT. BINGO. GREAT JOB, LEX AND WHEELS. THIS COFFEE'S AS BAD AS WHAT THEY SERVE IN THE TEACHER'S LOUNGE. THAT'S WHY I DRINK TEA. WHY DID MY PARENTS NOT DESTROY THE WATCH? PERHAPS THEY HOPED IT COULD BE USED FOR GOOD. IT'S TIME. EVER HEARD OF AN ELECTRIC PENCIL SHARPENER? OLDER TECHNOLOGY IS EASIER TO CONTROL. RIGHT. WHEN I GET YOU TO THE LAB, YOU FRIENDS WILL OPEN THE PORTAL AND OUT YOU GO. WHAT ABOUT MY PARENT'S PROJECTOR? IT DOESN'T MATTER, YOU'LL BE SAFE. WE CAN'T RUN AND LEAVE VERSTAG WITH THAT KIND OF TECHNOLOGY. ACTUALLY, RUNNING SOUNDS GREAT. WE NEED TO GO. LEAVING VERSTAG HERE, ANYWHERE ELSE WITH THAT KIND OF POWER IS WRONG. HE'LL CONTROL EVERYTHING. SO HE CONTROLS EVERYTHING HERE. SO WHAT? AT LEAST HE'S NOT IN OUR WORLD. BUT HE COULD BE. WAIT, WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY? AT LEAST HE'S NOT IN OUR WORLD? MR. FROTHINGHAM, YOU'RE A GENIUS, THAT'S IT. TIGER TRAP. COME ON. IN. [FROTHINGHAM] DID YOU CALL ME A GENIUS? AH! [LAUGHING] PERFECT TIMING, AS USUAL. OKAY, TURN ON THE MACHINE. OUR 24 HOURS ISN'T UP.

I DON'T KNOW, WE'LL SEE. ALL RIGHT, TEN SECONDS. YOU READY, LEX? AS I'LL EVER BE. OKAY, FIVE, FOUR, THREE... PLEASE, IN, IN. YOU AREN'T USING THEM AS TEST SUBJECTS? THIS WASN'T PART OF THE DEAL. DEAL? [LAUGHING] DEAL? I REFUSE TO SEND MY DAUGHTER INTO THE UNKNOWN. OH, PLEASE, DO NOT GIVE ME THE CARING PARENT ROUTINE. TURN ON THE MACHINE. -I REFUSE. -NO. NO, OKAY? BOOM. STOP! DON'T HURT THEM. -WE'LL GO. -WE? NO, MICKEY, NO... MOM, DAD, I'VE DONE IT BEFORE, IT'S OKAY. WE'LL GO WITH IT. WE'LL GO WITH IT! YOU SEE, YOUR DAUGHTER SAYS WE'LL GO WITH IT! SO, MODERN, SHE'S SO BRAVE! NOW, LOOK, I'M GETTING KIND OF TIRED OF THIS. TURN ON THE MACHINE. [WHEELS] TWO, ONE. OOH... HOW ABOUT THIS? WHO DID THAT? OOH... [LAUGHING] YOU. OH! OOH... COME ON, LET'S GO, BEFORE VERSTAG GETS HERE. BUT... WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU. NOW STAND NEXT TO YOUR SISTER. OKAY, TWO MINUTES TO GO. COME ON, KIDS, WHERE ARE THEY? NO! NO-NO-NO-NO! SO, WHY IS THIS MACHINE STILL WORKING? YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO DESTROY THE OTHER MACHINE. [HAZEL] WHAT HAPPENED? THE BULB, IT BURNT OUT. ARE THEY STUCK? ARE THEY STUCK IN THAT OTHER WORLD? I, UM... THE SPARE BULB! THERE'S A SPARE BULB! YOUR DAYS OF PUTTING PROFIT OVER PEOPLE ARE OVER. ARE OVER? MY DAYS OF SACRIFICING PEOPLE FOR PROFIT ARE OVER? I DON'T... PLEASE, COULD WE HAVE A PRIVATE CONVERSATION IN ANOTHER-- MAYBE OVER HERE? IT'S OKAY IF WE GO OVER HERE FOR A PRIVATE CONVERSATION. YOU ARE BLAMING ME FOR OTHER PEOPLE'S PAIN. IT'S SIMPLE. I PROVIDE A SERVICE. YOU BUY THE SERVICE. YOU DON'T BUY THE SERVICE, I DISAPPEAR, POOF. BUT NOW, YOU DISAPPEAR, POOF. WHY? BECAUSE YOU ARE A TRAITOR. T-R-A-Y-T-E-R, TRAITOR. FINISH HIM! [ELECTRONIC VOICE] KILL MODE ENGAGE. [SCHOOL BELL RINGING] THERE YOU ARE. OH, NO YOU DON'T! [GIRLS] HEY, WHEELS! SLOW DOWN, YOUNG MAN. BUSY! THIS IS MY DAY! IN! -TIGER TRAP -RIGHT. AH! [GIRL] OH! WATCH! [GASPS] -OOH! -KILL IT! FLIP THE SWITCH, MAN. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WE HAVE NEW COORDINATES. OW! OH! ABOUT TIME. AH! YOU BROKE MY NOSE! EVEN A PHYSICS TEACHER CAN BE A ACTION HERO. WAIT, THIS IS NOT HONG KONG! OR SEATTLE WHERE ARE WE? ANOTHER WORLD. -OKAY, GOOD TO GO. -PUNCH IT! WE ARE STUCK IN A CRAZY 'NOTHER WORLD! NO, YOU'RE STUCK. OH! AWW... NO! I AM HARDLY STUCK! FINISH THEM! GLADLY. THAT WON'T WORK HERE. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GROANING] OW. [GROANING] I'M CANCELING MY SERVICE. BUT WHY! WHY! I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING! IT'S NOT FAIR! I'M A GOOD PERSON! I TRY! I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING, I DO THE RIGHT THING! AND SHE GIVES IT BACK! EVA! IT'S YOUR FAULT! [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] [CHEERING] TIGER TRAP, BRILLIANT. AND YOU DON'T EVEN PLAY THE GAME. MISS MARTIN, YOU WERE TRULY OUTSTANDING. MAKE THAT AN A-PLUS. THANKS, MR. FROTHINGHAM. OH! -COME ON IN HERE! -COME ON. [ALL CHUCKLING] BUT WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH IT NOW? WE CAN'T MAKE ANOTHER VERSTAG. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT TWO M IS USED FOR THE GOOD OF EVERYONE. BUT HOW? SHARE IT. OPEN SOURCE. BRILLIANT. SOUNDS LIKE A TEAM EFFORT. I'M IN. COUNT ME IN. [LAUGHING] [MUSIC PLAYING] LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIPS. YOU EVER FEEL LIKE YOU'RE FROM ANOTHER WORLD? YEAH. [MUSIC PLAYING] THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF CREATIVITY IS A WARM ATMOSPHERE. AND THE FILMMAKERS MAKE A WONDERFULLY WARM ATMOSPHERE HERE. IF YOU WANT TO STAY RELEVANT IN THIS BUSINESS, YOU'RE GOING TO NEED YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN TECHNOLOGY. WHO ARE ALSO, UH, FAMILIAR WITH THE TRADITIONS OF FILM. NO ONE HAS EVER FIGURED OUT HOW TO MAKE A WORMHOLE. IF YOU COULD, IT WOULD BE SPECTACULAR. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GIRL 1] I JUST LOVED IT, IT WAS AWESOME HERE. [GIRL 2] WE WENT ON A FOOD TRUCK BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE A SCENE WAS BEING TAPED. [GIRL 3] I'M SO HAPPY FOR MYSELF THAT I DID THIS. YOU GET TO WORK WITH AMAZING PEOPLE AND DO AMAZING THINGS. [BOY] TO BE ON AN ACTUAL SET. IT HELPS FUEL MY PASSION FOR FILMMAKING BECAUSE I PLAN ON BECOMING A DIRECTOR. [GIRL] MY FAVORITE SCENE TO SHOOT WAS THE FIGHT SCENE BECAUSE IT HAS A LOT OF EXTRAS. [BOY] FEELING LIKE I'M APART OF THE MOVIE. NOBODY I KNOW CAN SAY THAT. [BOY 2] SEEING ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT GO INTO LIGHTING, CAMERAS, SOUND... IT WAS A REALLY GOOD EXPERIENCE. [GIRL] ACTUALLY SEEING THE ACTORS. NORMALLY, YOU SEE 'EM ON THE BIG SCREEN. BUT NOW YOU ACTUALLY GET TO SEE 'EM THERE IN FRONT OF YOU. [GIRL 2] KIND OF COOL KNOWING THAT WHEN THIS COMES OUT, YOU'RE GONNA SEE THIS. [GIRL 3] THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT AN ORDINARY TEENAGER DOES. [GIRL 4] IT WAS, LIKE, ONE OF THE BEST DAYS OF MY LIFE. IT WAS HONESTLY SO, SO COOL. [BOY] I GOT TO DO THE BOOM. [GIRL] I GOT TO SHADOW THE DIRECTOR. [BOY] I'M ALSO EXCITED TO BE USING THE CAMERA. [BOY 2] I'M GLAD TO BE A PART OF THE FILM BECAUSE IT'S THE ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME EXPERIENCE. [BOY 3] I'M MOST EXCITED TO LEARN ABOUT VIDEO EDITING THIS WEEK. [BOY 4] IT WAS JUST A VERY FULFILLING DREAM JUST TO BE HERE. [MUSIC PLAYING]
