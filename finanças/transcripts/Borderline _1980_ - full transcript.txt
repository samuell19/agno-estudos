[anxious violin music] [anxious violin music] - [Border Guide] Andale, Andale! [speaking Spanish] Andale! Andale! - [Border Guard] You, follow me. - Hey Ski, where'd you put down they came in? - E-six, what time did you put? - Four p.m. sound right? - Yeah, it's good enough for government work. - Vamanos. - [Border Guard] Yes ma'am, yes ma'am. - Join the party Jeb, grab a Guatemalan or maybe you'd rather have an El Salvadorian. There's plenty to go around. - You catch 'em, you clean 'em. Willie, what do you got? - Two groups, the guides split with their money and left these poor bastards rambling around in the brush for two days with no food. - [Jeb] You think they're part of that Sand Canyon bunch? - [Willie] No way Jeb, they're too sloppy. [speaking Spanish] - [Border Guard] Occupation? - Hey pal, where can I find the senior officer? - That's me, who are you? - Fante sir, Jimmy Fante. I've been sent out here on detail from New York. - Oh hey, you're a day late. - I kept gettin' lost. - Ah well, where are the others? - Others, sir? - They didn't send anybody else with you? - Not as far as I know, sir. - Oh Jesus. I asked for a dozen extra hands and they send one. I guess they feel one grunt from New York is worth 12 men, that right Fonte? - I kinda doubt that, sir. - No more sir, just call me Jeb okay? - Right, Jeb. - Let me see now. Hey, where are you taking him? - Holding pen, this one's a pujero. - [Border Guide] Lemme get your name. - What's a pujero? - He's a guide. Son of a bitch, preys on these other poor people. Hey Willie, Willie. This is Jimmy Fante? - Fante. - Willie, show him around, fill him in. - Come on, this way. My name's Willie Lambert. Gimme that, put it over here. All right now then, you look at this map. You see this here is our sector. That's about 1200 square miles, maybe 1,000 canyons. Now 10 years ago we were lucky if we caught 100 aliens a month but right now we're in the middle of a damned invasion. They're running right over us. Last summer this little pulled in over 3,000 a month and for every one we caught, three of 'em slipped past us. [speaking Spanish] How's your Spanish? - Impeccable. - Impeccable, we could use a lot of impeccable around here. - Wait, maybe impeccable was too strong a word. - Whatever it is, you just sit down here next to Mr. Monroe and practice your Spanish. Charlie Monroe, this is Jimmy Fante. Okay, let me find you somebody here, let's see. You sir. Por favor. - Como se llama? - Miguel Fernando Jesus Gomez. [speaking Spanish] - Momento. Como se llama? - Miguel Fernando Jesus Gomez. - This funny? [laughs] - Go ahead. - [Border Guide] Rodriguez, Roberto. Gonzales, Ernesto. Arsante, Victor. Gonzales, Jose. [speaking Spanish] - I hope it doesn't rain. - It might rain. - What's the matter with you? Your ass is really dragging, you look down Scooter. - Oh, just a little tired of it. Chase these Mexicans all over these goddamn hills, you catch 'em one day and they're back the next. There's this young kid in there, I've caught him four times this month myself. - Just look at it this way, if they didn't keep running, you'd be out of a job. What's happening, kid? - I don't know. Is it always like this? I just processed an old man who sold his tailor shop and gave up his life savings to come here. Now he's got nothing, his whole life went down the drain and I watched it. - [Willie] You're gonna hear a lot of sad stories, so don't let it get to you. What's coming down, Chief? - We're supposed to assist Chula tonight, work old La Mesa. - With all the men they got up there, they want assistance? There ain't but four of us on duty tonight to cover this whole sector. - I know but the orders just came down, there's a bunch comin' through and we have to give 'em some help. Me, Willie and the kid, we'll take La Mesa. You can work sensor traffic. If you get a chance, drop down around Tecate. Have a look around down there, will you? - Sleep tight, America. Your tax dollars are hard at work. [anxious trumpet music] [speaking Spanish] - I'll give you a little field training. You know what a sensor is? - No. - Well I'll show you. [anxious trumpet, violin music] This is a seismic sensor, you step on it, anywhere near it, it sends a signal to La Migra telling them exactly where you are. By the time you hit the road, they're waiting for you with a Greyhound bus to take you back home. - How'd you know that was there? - One of my guides got busted coming through here last week. You see how those trails criss-cross? That's where I'd plant it if I was them. - You're pretty smart for a white guy. - Uncle Sam spent a lot of bread in 'Nam teaching me how to be. Okay, we split up here. You take your group up that trail, horse trail then we'll meet you on the road. [speaking Spanish] [helicopter whirring] [yelling in Spanish] - [Border Pilot] I spotted 'em, they're taking off down towards that sandbar. - [Willie] Push 'em down towards the sandbar, drive 'em! - [Border Pilot] I got some in the bushes for you. Andale hombres, okay boys, party's over. [yelling in Spanish] - Andale! [speaking Spanish] Pronto! You been waiting long? - No I just got here, wait. Why don't you ride up in front with me? It smells like a cattle truck back here. - Gringo, with you at this time of night, that'd be like waiting a red flat at La Migra. Son. - No, [speaking Spanish] no. - You speak English, you understand me? - Yes sir, yes. - Good boy. He's your son, ever had a son before Mirandez? - [Mirandez] For all I know, I am father to 30 little bastards in Tijuana. [speaking Spanish] - Vito, Vito Morales senor. Mexico. Si senor, [speaking Spanish]. [anxious violin music] [humming country music] - Tomates. I wonder if he's hauling anything besides tomates? I think his tomatoes are wet. [anxious ensemble music] [sirens blaring] 63B. Buenas Noches, senor. - Good evening. What's the problem officer, are my taillights out? - No. It's just a routine check. What are you fellas doin' up this time of night? - We have to deliver these tomatoes all the way up to L.A. That's my boy, I brought him along to help me. - That's all you're hauling back there, tomatoes? - What else? - Well I thought maybe you might have some of your cousins stuck in the back there. - My worthless cousins I would haul in the manure, not tomatoes, you misjudge me senor. - Well maybe, I'd still like to have a look just to make sure. Will you hand me the keys with your left hand, please? - As you say officer, andale. - Will you step out of the truck please, come here. You wanna open that door for me? Well what do you know? All right partner, let's get this other side open. [gunshot booms] - Close it up. [Vito moaning, speaking in Spanish] - What about the boy? - Por favor. [coughing] - Sorry. [gunshot booms] Gimme a hand. Get the boy. - [Mirandez] Do you think he phoned in the license? - No, he didn't have enough time. - [Mirandez] There are too many witnesses. - Who are they gonna talk to? Come on, let's go. - Hey Phil, can I check that list with you here? - [Phil] Yeah. - This belongs to him. - Is there gonna be an autopsy on this? - [Phil] Sure there's gonna be an autopsy, he got shot. - How long you been here? - [Phil] I just got here 45 minutes ago. - What's this about? - Herb, not yet, I'll tell ya when. - All right Jeb, just doing my job. - Let me do mine first, they're not gonna go anywhere. You're the kid and you're Scooter. You and you. You're mine. Willie, you see the tire tracks? - Yeah, looks like a pretty heavy truck. I'll get Herb to get us some pictures. You know those sons of bitches rifled Scooter's car, they took his star scope and I don't know what else. - You think these mean anything? - From the truck maybe. - What else you got here? - It's so awful. - So where'd you see 'em? - Over there. - Uh-oh, here come those Feebies. - [Jeb] Run those tomatoes over to the University. Ask for Doc Warnham in the lab and tell him I'll call him later. - Okay. - FBI. - Any idea on the kid? - No, but he's wet. - Shotgun, huh? - They were shot here, landed over here and were dragged down where you see them now. Sawed-off. - Drugs? - Yeah, that's what I figure. I'll check with San Ysidro customs, see what came in last night. - Hey now wait a minute. They could be aliens. - Nobody kills for wetbacks. This kid was probably a mule who'd gotten away. Your man return fire? - His gun was never drawn. - We're sorry about your man. We'll do what we can to get the guys that did it. [police radio chatter] - [Carl] You were late getting in last night, Hotchkiss. - They had the choppers on. I had to hold back up in the hills 'til they cleared. - Everything's okay though? - Piece of cake. - I heard a border patrolman got killed last night. Shotgun, it was on the news. By the description they gave, I thought it might've been near one of our pickup points. - No. No, it must have been somewhere else. - Might get hot around here for a few days. Maybe we should ship all the wets out and clean the place up. - Yeah. Already at work. - You know what time the funeral is? - [Border Guard] I think it's somewhere right around noon. - Fill 'em in? - Yeah. - I know that Willie's already talked to you but I still have a couple things. The FBI is officially conducting this investigation but we're not gonna wait for them. What we're looking for is an old paratroop boot with a gash in the left heel and the driver's wearing a heavy ripple. From now on every man here is on a 12 hour shift. No vacations, no sick pay, no time off and when you're out there, remember that every truck and van is a possible load vehicle. I don't want anybody comin' back here and givin' me all that crap about probably cause. Let's go. Jimmy, you come with me. [anxious violin music] These are the tracks all right. [anxious violin, trumpet music] Yeah, this is the place. Been a lot of foot traffic through here, wouldn't you say? - If you say so. - Let's go. [anxious ensemble music] - You mind telling me what we're doing? - Cuttin' the sign, tracking. That's what we've been doing for the last hour. - What are you gonna do next, hold your ear to the ground? - Come here. It's all right, come here, I'm just gonna mark your boot. Turn around. We always mark our own boots. I knew one little fart that didn't, though and one day when he was working a section, he got all confused and started to follow his own footprints. - What happened to him? - Well he followed himself right up his own ass. We never did see him again. See that print? They came from there right down this way. - How do you know it wasn't a cow? - A cow has a cloven hoof, it would've cut this grass. But a man pushes it down and sometimes bruises it. Although I did know a crazy bastard who tied cow's hooves to his feet. It didn't work though. - Because a cow's got four legs, right? - Right, now you're catching on. Some of these guys strap tin cans, rugs to the bottom of their feet, even walk backwards. - [Jimmy] They sure go to a lot of trouble. - [Jeb] The stakes are high. - They find these often? - It's only the third time I've ever seen it and all in the last couple months. Look at that. It's the same damn boot print. We're dealing with one damn smart pujero. [speaking Spanish] - Hey man, what's happening Loco? You're shaking like a junkie. - You didn't hear what happened last night on the road? - No, what? - One of La Migra was killed. - No shit? - We're cruising down Highway 94, this dude pulls us over. El Marino blew him away, just like that. One of the boys got in the way, [speaking Spanish] he blew him away too. - Does La Migra know? - Nobody knows except El Marino, me and the wets. Don't say anything, man. The crazy bastard will kill the both of us. - Loco, see I'm cool okay? - You got 'em all cleaned up? Didn't let 'em mix with the others? - I did just like you said. - Good. Load 'em up. Open the door. [speaking Spanish] - Hotchkiss, if the checkpoint is working at San Clemente, we're gonna have to take the long way around to L.A. - They're not going to L.A., that's too close. Arturo, take 'em across I-10 to Phoenix. Put them on planes to Chicago. - Chicago? - All the flight information is in here, they've all got reservations. There's a lot more money in here than you're gonna need. Tell them not to worry about anything. There'll be people waiting for them when they get off the planes. If you get a chance, give 'em a couple water breaks okay? - Okay. - Okay. Hey. Amigo. Esta todo bien, come on, put a smile on your face. There's nothing to worry about. Come on, we're gonna find a place to ditch this crate. You follow me. - Okay, I'll follow you. - [Carl] In November we delivered 4,690 units Mr. Lydell, which is 21% up from the previous month. - Good work Richards, very impressive. - It is, considering these are traditionally slow months. We've managed to overcome that, make it a solid year round business. 878 units came from countries other than Mexico. We're making up to $1500 extra on each one of them. - What's the bottom line? - Last month we grossed 2,270,000. Drivers were paid 156,000 and guides were paid 319,000 and Hotchkiss took 310,000. That leaves a net to Lydell Industries of $765,000. - That bastard gets as much out of this operation as I do. - I know, but he's the key to it. Without him, we'd be lucky to move 1,000 bodies a month. - By the way, do you know anything about this? - I heard about it. - We're not involved, are we? - No. But we plan a low profile for a week or so, just as a precaution. - We're supposed to ship 2,000 around Christmas. I wouldn't want something stupid like this to screw things up. - Don't worry. - Good. Starting the first of the year, I want an increase on deliveries to 7500 a month, of which at least 1,000 should be women. Can we do it? - I don't know. Winter is a slow time. - Push on Hotchkiss. New York will take 2,000 a month if we can send them. We also have calls for at least 1,000 each from Chicago, Boston and Philadelphia. - Tijuana is gonna get awfully crowded. - We'll do our best to ease their population explosion. Keep up the good work, Richards. You know, someday this may be legitimate and we'll be listed on the commodities exchange. - Yeah, trading in wetback futures. - A wetback doesn't have a future. [doorbell rings] - Yes? - I'm looking for an E. Morales. - Where did you get this address? Why are you looking for this person? - There was a kid killed down on the border last night. He was a Mexican kid and he had that in his pocket. - Come in, please. Do you mind waiting in here, please? - [Elena] Your elbow goes on the green. Get that hand over there, no it's your knee on the red and then your elbow-- - Elena, could I see you a minute? - Oh yeah. Don't move 'til I get back. - This man needs to see you. - Elena Morales? - Who are you? - My name is Jeb Maynard. Did you send this? [Elena screams] - [Homeowner] Are you sure he was her son? Couldn't there be some mistake? - [Jeb] No mistake. - How did this accident happen? - [Jeb] Well Ms. Morales, it wasn't an accident. Your son was murdered. Some of the authorities believe that he was mixed up with drugs. - Oh no never, never. - I don't believe it either. I think he was being smuggled across the border. I also think you expected him here. - You're La Migra? - Yes but I'm not here to harm you. But you will have to go down and identify the body. - No. - Please, nobody will bother you. I'll take you down myself. - Why, why do you do this? - I had a friend that was killed along with your son. [ship horn blares] [knocking] - All those reports. - Right, last night. [telephone ringing] Okay, we're gonna get back to you. [Elena gasps] [weeping] - Vito. If I hadn't sent him the money, he would still be alive today. I must take him home. - I don't think you'll be able to do that. Your son was murdered, so they won't release the body. - Never? - No, not never but not for awhile. Ms. Morales, is there anything you can tell me that might help me catch the killer? - No. - Is there anything you can tell me about the man that brought you across the border, where he took you, anything at all? - I'm sorry, I do not remember those things. Mr. Maynard, I would like to help you but... Will you find the man who did this? - Oh yes, we'll find him. It may take some time but we'll find him. [ship horn blares] [somber funerary trumpet music] [gunshots booming] - We commit his body to the ground, earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust in the sure and certain hope of the resurrection unto everlasting life through Jesus Christ our Lord, let us pray. Dear God, in sorrow of heart and in quietness and confidence, we gather for these last solemn and tender moments of faith and love. Lift us above the shadows and sadness of death to give each of us thy word of peace. - Two months from retirement, this happens. It doesn't seem fair. - Yeah. - It makes you wonder sometimes, huh? It's good to see you Jeb, despite the circumstances. - Good to see you too, Malcolm. What's happening in Washington? - Same old bullshit. Still trying to get a decent bill through Congress so you can have the manpower and equipment you need to stem the tide out here. - I mean what's happening on Scooter's case with the FBI? - It's still under investigation. - Which means they haven't a damn thing to go on, right? You know, why don't they realize it has nothing to do with drugs. It has to do with smuggling aliens. - Why would anyone kill for aliens? - Oh, come on Malcolm. For the money, times have changed. It's a big business now, hell, they're running us over coming across that border. - Jeb, Jeb, don't start huh? It's the FBI's department but they don't look for aliens. They look for killers and bank robbers, lay off. - [Dispatch] Field units, this is Sector, does anybody copy? - This is Echo Two, go ahead. - [Dispatch] The FBI found that truck we've been looking for on Highway 64. - Hold on, Jeb, the FBI found that truck we've been looking for on Highway 64. [police radio chatter] - [Officer] Go on through, gentlemen. - [FBI Agent] This is Miller Unit Seven out here on 64. - [Officer] Hold it. - [Officer] Units five, 11 and 17 are also out here. - [FBI Agent] Standard '68 Ford, it's stripped. No plates, no ID numbers. - [Jeb] This is the truck all right, the tire tracks match. - [FBI Agent] It's drugs, just like we thought. - [Jeb] How do you figure that? - [FBI Agent] They must've had three tons of marijuana stashed in the back of this thing. - [FBI Agent] We'll call Drug Enforcement on this one. I guess that blows your theory on wets, Maynard. We'll let you know if the lab comes up with anything. - What do you think? - He's one of them but not the one we want. - Hey Jeb, you by that drug stuff? - Someone went to the trouble of removing all identification but they leave a trace of marijuana like those bags? No, I don't buy it. - Come on. So, you satisfied? - About the drugs in there? - Yeah. - Nope. - Let the FBI take care of it. They know what they're doing, it's not our jurisdiction. It's theirs, don't worry about it okay? - Yeah sure, okay. [speaking Spanish] - [Man] Hey, you forgot your ticket stub hombre. Get a carwash, loco. [knocking] - [Jeb] Ms. Morales, I'd like to talk with you. - [Elena] I cannot talk now, please come back later. - [Jeb] It won't wait. - I'm working. - Please Ms. Morales, it's very important. Can we do this alone? [speaking Spanish] - How did you find me? - The lady you work for gave me this address. Your son Ms. Morales, he was not mixed up with the drugs. He was being smuggled across the border just like I said and the guy that was bringing him across killed him. - You find the man? - No. I'm having a lot of problems that way. As far as everybody else is concerned, the case is closed and you're the only one that can help me. That's why I'm here? - How? - You know the way that you came across the border into this country. Now if you and me went down into Mexico and came back the same way-- - Oh no, I couldn't. - Ms. Morales, it's not my way to threaten anybody but I'll have to send you back on a Border Patrol bus. But if you go over with me, you have a chance of coming back. - If I tell you where you can meet the arranger, isn't that enough? - I couldn't get away with it alone, my Spanish isn't good enough to pass as a Mexican. They'd spot me right away. [car horns honking] [woman screaming] - Stop, stop, grab her, get her! [steam hissing] You'll be all right, come on. - They will let the gringo woman go and next week she'll come to Tijuana again to get her new maid. [whistles blowing] [Spanish style violin music] [singing in Spanish] The bar over there, that's where we start. [jazzy ensemble music] We'll wait for the arranger. - Oh, here's comes trouble. - It's all right. [speaking Spanish] - Gracias. No, eh? [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] - You see that thing he's looking through? See if you can find out where he got it. - Senor. [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [anxious violin music] [shouting in Spanish] - [Bandit] Andale, Andale, Andale. - Hey look what I found, a puta. Come on you little whore, lemme show you-- [woman screaming] [anxious mid tempo violin music] - [Jeb] Follow the guide. - Hurry up! - [Elena] Senor! - Come on. [speaking Spanish] - Nombre? - Antonio. - What is this? - Glad to see you're hard at work, Willie. - What the hell are you doing out here? Who's side are you on, anyway? - It's a long story, I'll tell you about it later. Can we go? - Yeah, yeah. - What do you do now? - I don't know. - And me? - What about you? - When will you send your men here to pick me up? will I have time to pack my clothes or will you pick me up like the coyote do across the border? - Just a minute. Wait a minute, listen. After the holidays, why don't you get in touch with me and I'll try to help you get permanent resident status. - Will you do that? - Sure. You tried to help me, I'll try to help you. - Thank you. [knocking] - Jeb? It's me, Jimmy. [faint coughing] Hey Jeb, come on wake up. - Hi. - It's a beautiful day. - Yeah? Why don't you go out there and enjoy it, you know? I'll see you tomorrow. - They told me about your trip across the border. It sounded like fun. - I was pretty close to something but I blew it. - That's too bad. So what now? - Unless somebody gets a brilliant idea, I guess we're gonna have to do it the hard way and hope maybe we can find those boot prints someplace else sometime. - Maybe we can improve the odds a little. - How's that? - Remember those tomatoes I found near Scooter's body? That guy down at the University lab came up with something very interesting. They were sprayed with a pesticide called diazinon. Real deadly stuff, only the biggest commercial growers can get a permit. So I checked it out at the agricultural office. It seems nearly 1,000 people put in for pesticide permits last year but only 86 used diazinon. Hey, am I boring you or what? Yes but it's educating, go ahead. - Well I just wanted to tell you that out of the 86, only six grow tomatoes. - What? Six? - Yeah, six. - Hey, that's a damn fine piece of tracking. I'm proud of you, you did well. [speaking Spanish] - [Border Guard] I thought we were going home, now he wants us to stick around. - Boys, you all received your assignments. Do you know what you're looking for? - Yeah. - Right. - The guy we're looking for is Anglo, remember that. We'll work our way west from the Glen Allen ranch. Let's not waist daylight, okay? - [Border Guard] Immigration! Immigration! [speaking Spanish] - Echo One, this is Echo Four. We got a bunch near Piper's and we'll need a couple vans. - Any of them Anglos? - Negative. - Let 'em go. - Repeat? - I said let 'em go, we're only looking for Anglos. - Jeb says spring them. - What the hell for? - We're only looking for Anglos. - Then what the hell are we doing out in a field like this? - How the hell am I supposed to know? - I tell ya, this shit's turned old Jeb's head around. [speaking Spanish] - What do you got here, Willie? - I followed a group of workers through the fields down the road and this is where they led me. - How many of them are there? - 25 or 30. What do you wanna do, you wanna bust 'em? - No, I wanna check out the ranch house first. Hey Jimmy, if you want a closer look go ahead. - Oh no no, it's okay. - We have time, go ahead. [baby moaning] [speaking Spanish] - [Hotchkiss] We cut traffic in half, we're shipping in 2500. That's 2,000 less than what we were doing. - [Carl] We need 10,000 a month next year. - Carl, you're getting greedy. - La Migra is here. - You two stay outta sight. - What do you think they want? - It's just routine. - What about the stuff in the barn? - No, they won't even look okay? Take it easy, relax. - Hey look man, that guy in the mustache. He was in the group I brought over the other night. - You're crazy. - No man, I'm sure. - That's the head honcho of the La Mesa station. Get outta here. - [Jeb] Hi Carl, how you doing? - [Carl] Holding up, you come to bust my gardeners? - [Jeb] Well I did notice you have a whole new crew working the back property, maybe I will. - I don't know why you go to all this trouble after all these years. You know we can't get anyone else to do this work. - Not for the wages you pay. You have some more hidden around, maybe in the barns, the house? - No. - Mind if I take a look? - Yes. - Not very neighborly. - [Carl] I don't think it's very neighborly to go around busting people who are trying to better themselves. - When I take them off here, they better themselves. I don't supposed you'll let us have a drink of water? - Sure, you can use the hose like everyone else. - This guy Richards is a real sweetheart. He's got these people living in shit and he's got the balls to act as if he cares about them. - He doesn't care about them, it's the economics he cares about. Hey wait a minute. Look at this. Hey Willie. - Oh? - Come here. Look at that print, it belongs to the guy we're looking for. Jesus, spread the men out, see if they can spot him. - You bet. - Where the hell are they going? [speaking Spanish] - [Jeb] Never mind those two, check with Willie right over there. - All right. - What the hell's going on? - [Jeb] I wanna have a look in your house. - You don't get inside the house without a warrant. - What's the problem, Carl? Somebody turn in your cleaning lady? - [Carl] Some guys never outgrow the need to play cowboys and Indians. - Don't be too harsh on my buddy here, he needs all the help he can get. I'll see you tomorrow, Carl. - Take it easy. - Excuse me. - We can't afford to lay off right now. We've got 2,000 wets on order by the end of the month. Half the money is already in with another million due on delivery. We have got to maintain our credibility. - I think it's too risky. Maynard's on to something, I can just feel it. - You're overreacting. - He's like a bulldog, he gets something between his teeth, he doesn't let go. - How long would it take you to put 2,000 wets together? - Overnight but that's not the problem. It's getting them across the border-- - We're going to do it all in one day. - [Carl] That's impossible. - Nothing is impossible. We're gonna do it Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. La Mesa always runs a skeleton crew then. The day after Christmas, the ranch will be clean again. - I still don't think it can be done. - Richards, it will be done. - We're making one big run tomorrow night. We're bringing 2,000 wets across and we're moving 'em off this ranch in less than 12 hours. - That's impossible. - No, it isn't. For working Christmas Eve, you'll each receive a bonus of $1,000. Okay. We're all taking the Mother Grundy Truck Trail. - [Border Guide] What about La Migra's sensors? - Arturo and I tore out the sensors yesterday afternoon. Now we hit the trail at 30 minute intervals. Arturo's load goes first. I'll bring the last group through. It's imperative that each group hit the trail and the road at the time designated for it to do so. If you have any problems, if you cannot make it on time, ditch your group and leg it home. We've got no time for screw ups. Any questions? [anxious violin music] [faint speaking in Spanish] - Hi, remember me? Huh? We came across the border a couple nights ago, now you remember? [thud, groans] You remember me? Remember? You son of a bitch, I'm gonna make you remember. I'll freshen up your memory damn quick. [gurgling] Now do you remember? You killed a friend of mine and a little boy about a week ago. Yes, and now I'm gonna kill you, you son of a bitch. - I didn't kill 'em, it was Marino. - What's his real name? - Hotchkiss. - Hotchkiss huh, what's he look like? What's he look like? - He's a white guy. He's got blond hair, he killed La Migra. - Okay listen, there's something big coming down at that ranch. I want you to tell me about it. I want you to set up Hotchkiss for me, you hear? You hear? - If I tell you, I go free. - You go free if I nail him. - Okay. All right. - [Border Guard] It's Christmas and he's got the whole station here, wonder if something ain't happening tonight. - [Jimmy] Hey Denny, Denny. - [Border Guard] Yeah well, we're gonna have Christmas dinner a little late tonight. We gotta work tonight. - Something's going down. - What do you mean what time? Of course I know what time it is, I'm wearing a watch. - [Willie] I know it's Christmas Eve. [chattering, overlapping voices] You tell him Willie said that. He's on his way to church with his family. - [Jeb] All right. - [Border Guard] I can't talk any longer, I gotta go. - Boys. I wanna remind everybody not to be too anxious tonight and jump the gun. We want to hit 'em inside the ranch property, which is about right here. I also want to remind you to check your flashlights, Walkie-Talkies, scopes and especially your firearms. We might have use for them tonight. Any questions? Yeah Willie, let's move in. [anxious ensemble music] What's it look like over there? - My area is clean. - There's a light on in the barn. - Yeah, I thought I heard someone. - Dave, you better check that out. Jimmy, you go with him. - Right. - Willie, you and Matt position the men so that the entire area is covered. - Right. [anxious violin music] - [Carl] What the hell? - Come along, Carl. Ooh Carl, this is quite an operation you got here. Really classy. How many men were in here? - Just those two. - [Ab] Hey Jeb, this is Ab, I think the first truck just came on the property. - Okay, we're ready for them here but make sure you're not seen now. [speaking Spanish] - Hold it, sucker! [anxious piano, violin music] - Okay pal, inside. - [Border Guard] Not so fast amigo, come on. [anxious violin music] - [Border Guard] Get out here, get going, move it! - Come on folks, come on now. - Vamanos. Andale, Andale. Andale. [anxious trumpet music] Vamanos. Out this way. Vamanos. - [Jimmy] Where do you think Hotchkiss is? - [Jeb] He's supposed to be in the last truck. - [Border Guard] Lead 'em right through there. - Quickly, quickly, [speaking Spanish]. - Get in there, gettin' busy out there. Starting to run behind schedule. - [Border Guard] Andale, Andale. [anxious violin, piano music] [anxious trumpet music] - Okay Charlie, now this guy's dangerous, be careful. - Right. - [Hotchkiss] Stop at the house, get them in the barn. I gotta talk to Richards, we're running late. [yelling in Spanish] - Where is he? - In the house. - [Willie] Cuff him, get him inside. Jimmy, make sure nobody gets out. Get everybody in there, move, move. [machine gunfire booming] [tense ensemble music] [tense up tempo ensemble music] [birds chirping] [rustling] [bird cawing repeatedly] [wings flapping] - [Jeb] End of the road. [gunfire booming] [anxious violin music] [chattering] - [Reporter] One more. There's Lydell now. - Wait a second. - [Reporter] Rolling there, this way. One more, please. One more. - [Woman] Ooh, that's the man that was in the paper. - [Man] He's the guy. - [Woman] I know who he is. - [Man] It's Lydell. - Would you like to make a statement regarding the trial, Mr. Lydell? - I was never concerned because I knew the charges were groundless. You have to believe in the American system and I'll tell you something, the system works. - In a month, he'll be back in business. - It's okay kid, so will we. - [Photographer] Can we have one shot? - [Reporter] Charlie, gimme some more slack on that cable. Mr. Lydell sir, just one question. [chattering, overlapping voices] One question, sir. Mr. Lydell. [relaxed ensemble music] [relaxed ensemble music] [up tempo ensemble music]
