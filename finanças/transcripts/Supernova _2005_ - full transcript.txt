Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO REMAIN CALM. THE PRESIDENT HAS MOBILIZED THE 101st AIRBORNE DIVISION, TO ASSIST LOCAL CRISIS UNITS. THE SCOPE OF THE DEVASTATION IS STILL NOT COMPLETELY KNOWN. THESE WILDFIRES ARE THE WORST. WE THINK THEY'RE STILL GONNA HAVE WATER SHORTAGES. BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF TOURISTS AND VISITORS IN THIS AREA AT ANY GIVEN TIME, CASUALTIES ARE DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO ASSESS, AND IT MAY BE DAYS… YOU OK? OK, I GOT THE SHOT. I GOT THE SHOT. AS YOU CAN SEE, PETER, WE'RE STILL EXPERIENCING ISOLATED STRUCTURAL EXPLOSIONS AND FIRES. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAS INSTRUCTED THOSE PEOPLE IN THE HOT SPOT AREAS TO RELOCATE TO THE RED CROSS CENTERS. THOSE CENTERS ARE FILLING UP, AND IT MAY BE… - WELL, IT SEEMS AS THOUGH WE'VE LOST OUR REMOTE SIGNAL FROM THE CENTER OF THE MAIN DESTRUCTION. WE APOLOGIZE FOR THAT, BUT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE RESUMING OUR COVERAGE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. MOST OF THE COUNTRY HASN'T SEEN THAT MUCH. WE'VE BEGUN COLLECTING ESSENTIAL PERSONNEL FROM OUR LISTS, BUT WE SURE HAVE A WAYS TO GO. A PANICKED EXODUS OF THE GENERAL POPULATION BEFORE WE'VE REACHED TARGET NUMBERS WOULD BE A DISASTER. THE METEOR HIT IS A GOOD COVER FOR NOW, BUT WE HAVE GOT TO KEEP SHEPARD'S THEORIES OF A SUPERNOVA OUT OF THE MIX ANY WAY WE CAN. BECAUSE WE CANNOT TOLERATE ANY DELAYS IN THE TENANTING PROCESS. I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE ON THAT. THESE ARE DIFFICULT TIMES, PEOPLE. NONE OF US WANTED THIS TO HAPPEN. BUT THIS IS WHAT WE WERE TRAINED FOR. OUR JOB… IS TO FACE THE ARITHMETIC, AS ABRAHAM LINCOLN SAID. IF WE CAN DO THIS WITHOUT SENTIMENTALITY, WITHOUT NOSTALGIA, MANKIND HAS A CHANCE FOR A FUTURE. IF WE CAN'T, MANKIND CAN ONLY HAVE A PAST. DELGADO. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT KEEPING DR. RICHARDSON IN THE RESIDENCE PODS. - WHY IS THAT, SIR? - HE PANICKED. HE'LL EITHER SETTLE DOWN, OR HE WON'T. I'D FEEL BETTER IF YOU TRANSPORT HIM TO THE CONTAINMENT COMPOUND. FOR HIS OWN SAFETY. SIR. I WAS WONDERING IF YOU'D HEARD ANYTHING, SIR. I'M SORRY. THE RETRIEVAL TEAM WE SENT MADE IT VERY CLEAR TO YOUR FAMILY IT WOULD BE SAFER FOR THEM TO JOIN YOU HERE. I UNDERSTAND, SIR. SOME PEOPLE JUST AREN'T CONVINCED OF THE SEVERITY OF THIS SITUATION, OR THEY'D RATHER TAKE THEIR CHANCES WHERE THEY ARE. IF I COULD JUST SPEAK WITH THEM… WE CAN'T FORCE THEM TO COME IN, LISA. WE FORCED DR. RICHARDSON, SIR. HE'S AN ESSENTIAL. YOU'RE AN ESSENTIAL. SURFACE RECOVERY CREWS, STAND DOWN UNTIL 0900. SURFACE RECOVERY CREWS, STAND DOWN UNTIL 0900. REBREATHER ANALYSIS SCHEDULES ARE AVAILABLE FOR KEY LEADERS IN THE TECHNICAL POOL. REBREATHER ANALYSIS SCHEDULES ARE AVAILABLE FOR KEY LEADERS IN THE TECHNICAL POOL. THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN SECURED. THE JOINT CHIEFS ARE WITH HIM. THE CABINET HAS BEEN ROUNDED UP AND A GOOD NUMBER OF SENATORS AND REPRESENTATIVES ARE WITH MARSHALS OR STATE POLICE AT TEMPORARY SHELTERS. SO, WHAT DO WE KNOW? ST. LOUIS HAS BEEN DEVASTATED. IT SEEMS THE ATMOSPHERE PROVIDED US WITH SOME PROTECTION, BUT THE IMPACT AND THE RESULTING FIRES HAVE LAID WASTE TO THE ENTIRE METROPOLITAN AREA. HOUSTON, GRAND RAPIDS, AND SEVERAL MILLION ACRES OF NATIONAL PARKLANDS OUT WEST ARE UP IN FLAMES. THERE ARE FIRES ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF LOS ANGELES AND SAN DIEGO. THE EVACUATION IS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE THE FIRE ALMOST SURROUNDS THE METRO AREAS. - ANY WAY TO TELL IF WE HAVE MORE LIKE THAT HEADED OUR WAY? D.O.D., NATO, AND SEATO INFORMATION FIBER OPTIC INTRANET NETWORK IS STILL FUNCTIONING. WE DO HAVE LIMITED COMMUNICATIONS ABILITIES TO TAP INTO OBSERVATION RESOURCES WORLDWIDE. IT IS OUR BEST AND ONLY HOPE TO TRY TO CATCH NEW EVENTS AS THEY FORM. WHAT WE NEED IS SOMEONE WHO KNOWS SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON. - FINE SOMEONE. NOW. - YES, SIR. I CAN ONLY SPECULATE. BUT IT IS BECOMING CLEAR TO ME THAT THERE ARE EFFORTS UNDER WAY TO TRY TO MINIMIZE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PHENOMENA THAT THE WORLD HAS EXPERIENCED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS. BUT THESE INCIDENTS… THE AIRLINE CRASHES, THE ELECTRICAL STORMS, THE BLACKOUTS… WERE ALL ACCURATELY ANTICIPATED IN DR. SHEPARD'S RESEARCH, WHICH I OBTAINED FROM HIS OBSERVATORY JUST AFTER HE DISAPPEARED. THE BEGINNINGS OF WHAT YOU'D CALL A SUPERNOVA? YES. WHICH MEANS? IT MEANS THAT THE SUN IS GOING TO EXPAND… AND WILL EVENTUALLY CONSUME OUR ENTIRE SOLAR SYSTEM. I'M LAURIE STEPHENSON OF CHANNEL 7 NEWS. AND FOR THE RECORD, MY REPORTS ON DR. SHEPARD'S WORK AND HIS CURRENT DISAPPEARANCE HAVE NOT BEEN ALLOWED TO AIR. SO I'VE MADE THE DECISION TO DEFY MY SUPERIORS AND TO GET THIS INFORMATION OUT THE ONLY WAY I KNOW HOW. TO ALL OF YOU WHO SEE THIS, I CAN ONLY PROMISE TO CONTINUE REPORTING WHAT I LEARN UNTIL SUCH TIME AS I'M PREVENTED FROM DOING SO. YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU GUYS HAVE ME IN THE WRONG ROOM. THERE'S NO TELEPHONE, I GOT NO MINI BAR. WHAT IS UP WITH THAT? STAND UP. OH, COME ON. HANDS. COLONEL WILLIAMS WAS RIGHT ABOUT YOU. YEAH. HE'S A GREAT JUDGE OF CHARACTER. HE SHOULD DEFINITELY BE THE ONE GETTING TO CHOOSE WHO LIVES AND WHO DIES. LET'S GO. WHERE WE GOING? THE COLONEL BELIEVES YOU'D BE MORE COMFORTABLE AT ANOTHER LOCATION. DON'T MAKE THIS HARDER THAN IT HAS TO BE. PAPERS. LET'S GO, SOLDIER. IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE. YES, MA'AM. WHAT DID I MISS? CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS BREACHED THE ATMOSPHERE. SAINT LOUIS? NO ONE KNOWS HOW BAD, BUT IT'S BAD. SO, DELGADO, HOW'S THE FAMILY? GET OUT. GET UNDRESSED. MY MOTHER AND SISTER LIVE IN SAINT LOUIS. YOU LISTEN. HE'S FINE, I PROMISE. SO, I THINK HE'S OK. HE'S JUST CALLING TO LET YOU KNOW. HALEY! HALEY! I'M SORRY, MOM. I KNOCKED OVER MY GLASS. I GOT SCARED, I… ARE YOU OK? DID YOU CUT YOURSELF? NO. NO. I'LL CLEAN IT UP. DARLING, WHAT HAPPENED? I WAS ON THE INTERNET. IT'S STILL WORKING. I WAS SEEING MAYBE IF DADDY HAD E-MAILED OR SOMETHING. THINKING WHAT I'M THINKING? YEAH. EASY PICKIN'S THIS WILL BE. UNH! HEH HEH! FINE, MATE. THERE YOU GO. PUNCH IT. LET'S GO! I'LL TRY AND LET YOU KNOW HOW TO REACH US, BUT I'M NOT SURE I'LL GET THROUGH. DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME, MADAM. I'LL BE FINE. BUT I WILL WORRY, TERESA. AS SOON AS YOU MAKE THE ARRANGEMENTS, YOU LOCK UP THE HOUSE, AND YOU LEAVE. AND WHEN THIS IS OVER, I'LL COME FIND YOU. I KNOW YOU WILL, MADAM. LISTEN TO YOUR MOTHER. BYE, TERESA. I PROMISE I'LL SEE YOU AGAIN SOON. LET'S GO. TO ALL OF YOU WHO SEE THIS, I CAN ONLY PROMISE TO CONTINUE REPORTING WHAT I LEARN UNTIL SUCH TIME AS I'M PREVENTED FROM DOING SO. - ONE OF MY PEOPLE'S KIDS DOWNLOADED IT THIS AFTERNOON, E-MAILED IT TO HIS MOTHER. IT MUST BE EVERYWHERE BY NOW. I RECOGNIZE HER. WE KNOCKED HEADS A FEW TIMES IN BOSNIA OR OMAN… SOMEWHERE DOWN THE LINE. I HAD SOMEONE CHECK THE STATION. SHE HASN'T BEEN SEEN FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS. WE GOT TEAMS UNDERGROUND. WE'LL FIND HER. LISTEN, AT THE MOMENT, I GOT MORE PRESSING PROBLEMS. SIR, WE STILL NEED TO DISCUSS THE SITUATION HERE. TELL ME. SHE COMMANDEERED ONE OF THE VEHICLES, LEFT THE FACILITY ABOUT 2 HOURS AGO. RICHARDSON IS DEFINITELY WITH HER. SHE HAD PAPERS WITH YOUR SIGNATURE. CLEVER GIRL. I'M SORRY. LOOK, RICHARDSON, WE'VE GOT ANOTHER HOUR, MAYBE 2, BEFORE WILLIAMS FINDS OUT AND SENDS HIS DOGS. NOW, IF I WERE YOU, I'D BE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WITH MY NEWFOUND FREEDOM. GET TO MY WIFE, LITTLE GIRL. IF WE'RE LUCKY, I CAN GET YOU INTO THE CITY IN A COUPLE OF DAYS. THEN WHAT? THEN… YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN. YOU CAN'T MAKE IT TO SAINT LOUIS, DELGADO. IT'S HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD. WATCH ME. THERE'S A NOTEBOOK IN THE DUFFEL. YOU SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT IT. THESE ARE CHENISLAV'S NOTES. JUST TELL ME I HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO FIND MY MOTHER AND MY SISTER. IT'S SO PEACEFUL. HMM. - I NEVER THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE ANYTHING IN THIS WORLD I COULD BE SO AFRAID OF. COLE WON'T FIND YOU, BROOKE. NOT HERE. I JUST WISH I COULD GET A HOLD OF CHRIS. HEY. I THINK I GOT A PROBLEM IN THE FUEL LINE. SHE'S JERKIN' LIKE A MARE IN HEAT. CAN'T DO MUCH UNTIL TOMORROW. BUT MY WIFE'S GOT A LITTLE MOTEL OUT BACK. REASONABLE RATES. THANKS. MIND KEEPIN' HER INSIDE, THOUGH? THE SUN'S A KILLER ON HER FINISH. - SHE WON'T SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY TILL YOU'RE BACK. WHAT NOW? ANOTHER RIDE. HANG HERE. GET IN. WHEN YOU GO BAD, YOU REALLY GO BAD, DON'T YOU? SOME THINGS YOU JUST NEVER FORGET. WOW. THIS IS REALLY GOOD. I… I CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME I HAD A HOME-COOKED MEAL. YOU'RE VERY NICE TO DO THIS. WELL, IT'S MY PLEASURE. SOME FOR ME. AND TO US. CHEERS. DID YOU LEAVE ANYONE? BEHIND, I MEAN. NO. NO. NO ONE SPECIAL. I WAS MARRIED. GREAT GUY, ACTUALLY. SOMEHOW, I DON'T THINK SO. LIFE IS FULL OF SURPRISES, ISN'T IT? HOW IRONIC. IF I HADN'T SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE… LOOKING AT THE STARS… I MIGHT HAVE MISSED THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING ON EARTH I'VE EVER SEEN. WHY IS THAT WE FIND THE BEST THINGS… WHEN THERE'S SO LITTLE TIME TO ENJOY THEM? I WONDER IF ANYBODY KNOWS. MIGHT BE BETTER IF IT'S FAST. I'M NOT SURE HOW "CIVILIZATION" CAN HANDLE THE INEVITABILITY OF ITS OWN END. I WISH SHEPARD WASN'T SO FRIGGIN' SMART OR I WASN'T SO STUPID. THERE HAS TO BE AN ANOMALY… I JUST CAN'T SEE IT. - MAYBE IT ISN'T THERE. - CHENISLAV WAS SURE IT WAS. SOMETHING ABOUT SHEPARD'S ASSUMPTIONS BOTHERED HIM. ASSUMPTIONS? IF THE PREMISE IS WRONG, EVERYTHING AFTER THE PREMISE IS WRONG. CHENISLAV HAD A FEELING. - I GOT A FEELING. - WHAT? WE'RE IN TROUBLE. THIS GAS GAUGE READ FULL NEARLY TWO HOURS AGO. HOW FAR HAVE WE COME? FAR ENOUGH TO BE OUT OF GAS PRETTY SOON. DO YOU THINK ANYBODY'S SEEN IT YET? - WE POSTED IT ON EVERY NETWORK WE COULD ACCESS. THERE'S YOUR ANSWER. WE HAVE TO GET MORE INFORMATION, GET BACK ONLINE, KEEP PEOPLE INFORMED. WE'RE GOING TO S.P.L. YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS. - IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT SOLAR RESEARCH LAB IN THE WORLD. IF THERE'S ANY PLACE WE CAN FIND OUT WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON, IT'S THERE. OK, TRY IT AGAIN. AW, FORGET IT. FORGET IT. SHE'S DRY. GIVE ME THE KEYS. GRAB THE DUFFEL. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? LOOKING FOR THINGS TO SALVAGE. UHH. YOU NEVER KNOW. WILLIAMS? PLAYING MUSIC? HEY, GUYS! WHAT'S UP? OUT OF GAS. WELL, COME ON. GET IN. WE'RE GOING TO A PARTY! THEY GOT A PHONE THERE? WHO CARES? WHOO! MOTORCYCLE ENGINE REVVING] DELGADO! SORRY. OUR SUN HAS ENTERED THE EARLY PHASES… OUR SUN HAS ENTERED THE EARLY PHASES OF… OUR SUN HAS ENTERED THE EARLY PHASES OF… OUR SUN HAS ENTERED THE EARLY PHASES OF WHAT WILL ULTIMATELY RESULT IN A SUPERNOVA… WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS THE SOLAR EQUIVALENT OF THE PERFECT STORM, RECORDED ABOUT 3 HOURS AGO. THE PLASMA FLARES HAVE AN INTENSITY AND VELOCITY THAT FAR EXCEED ANYTHING EVER RECORDED. IS IT GONNA HIT US? NOT HIT…BURY. OUR SIMULATIONS PREDICT THAT THE MASS WILL DISPERSE ON ITS WAY HERE. IT'LL HIT US LIKE A SCATTERGUN LOADED WITH NUCLEAR BIRD SHOT. WHEN? TRAVELING AT OVER A MILLION MILES AN HOUR. THE SUN IS 93 MILLION AWAY. YOU DO THE MATH. DAMAGE ASSESSMENT. ST. LOUIS TIMES A THOUSAND. COLONEL, I THINK IT'S TIME FOR US TO MAKE THE EVACUATION. WILLIAMS. I'M AFRAID THAT'S NOT GONNA BE POSSIBLE NOW. WHAT? I'M AFRAID WE'RE SPREAD TOO THIN. OUR PRIORITIES HAVE DEFINITELY CHANGED. WE HAD AN AGREEMENT, COLONEL. I'M SORRY. YOU WANT SOME? NO. NO, THANKS. HOW OLD ARE YOU? AS OLD AS I'M GONNA GET, DAD. CHRISTOPHER. CHECK THIS OUT. ZERO TO 100 IN 6 SECONDS. LUXURY. AND KICK-ASS. THEY'VE ALL GOT THEIR KEYS IN THEM AND A FULL TANK OF GAS. WELL, TAKE YOUR PICK. I JUST WANNA GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. THAT GIRL BACK THERE WAS JUST A FEW YEARS OLDER THAN MY DAUGHTER. YEAH. KIDS ARE ALWAYS THE FIRST TO SUFFER. I SAW IT IN BOSNIA… IN IRAQ… TAKE AWAY THEIR HOPE FOR A FUTURE, THEY GET OLD REAL FAST. ARE YOU RELIGIOUS? NOT REALLY. ARE YOU? WENT TO SUNDAY SCHOOL WHEN I WAS YOUNG. "AND THE MOON BECAME AS BLOOD… "AND THE FIFTH ANGEL SAID, "'THE STARS IN THE HEAVEN FELL ONTO THE EARTH… LIKE FIGS FROM A FIG TREE… SHAKEN BY THE WIND." REVELATIONS. I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU WEREN'T RELIGIOUS. OUR SUN IS GOING OUT, TAKING OUR SOLAR SYSTEM AND EVERYTHING LIVING WITH IT. THE END OF THE WORLD. WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN? IT'S JUST A PROCESS, A NUCLEAR ELECTROMAGNETIC PHENOMENON. A PROCESS? IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS WE'RE PRETTY INSIGNIFICANT. THAT'S THE WAY YOU REALLY FEEL? ABOUT YOUR WIFE… YOUR DAUGHTER… INSIGNIFICANT? THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE. HANDEY HAS BEEN TRACKING THIS THING ALL ALONG. HE KNEW ABOUT DR. SHEPARD'S THEORIES BEFORE ANY OF US. AND HE'S BEEN PASSING THE INFORMATION ON TO SOME GUY NAMED HARLAN WILLIAMS. HARLAN WILLIAMS? THAT'S RIGHT. DO YOU KNOW HIM? HE WAS IN BOSNIA. HE'S N.I.O. OH. SO THAT'S HOW THEY GOT ON THIS. WELL, GINNY, I SEEM TO HAVE UNDERESTIMATED YOU. YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND, I HAD PEGGED. OK, WAIT A MINUTE. YOU'RE GONNA QUESTION HER ETHICS AFTER WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING? AND WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU THINK I HAVE BEEN DOING? SELLING US OUT. YOU'VE BEEN FEEDING DR. SHEPARD'S INFORMATION TO NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE FOR MONTHS. FOR YEARS. HOW DO YOU THINK WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO AFFORD ALL THE RESEARCH THAT BRILLIANT PEOPLE LIKE YOU WANT TO DO HERE? OH, I SUPPOSE THEY NEVER TAUGHT YOU THE PRINCIPLE OF QUID PRO QUO UP AT STANFORD, HUH? WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WE'RE GOING TO SCRUB EVERY SITE WE CAN ACCESS ON EVERY S.P.L. NETWORK, BACK UP EVERY PIECE OF DATA WE CAN TO THE SERVERS DOWN HERE. AND IF THERE'S ANY POSSIBILITY THAT SOMEONE, SOMEDAY, SURVIVES THIS CATACLYSM, I WANT THEM TO FIND WHAT WE DID HERE. I WANT THEM TO KNOW. MOM! AUNT LINDA! MOM! LOOK. OH, GOD. AUTHORITIES ARE WARNING THAT CONTINUED CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE WILL, IF NECESSARY, BE MET WITH DEADLY FORCE. INITIAL REPORTS HAVE STATED THAT THE SOURCE OF THE FIRE THAT RAINED DOWN ON ST. LOUIS WAS INDEED THE SUN. WHEN ASKED TO CONFIRM THESE REPORTS, SPOKESPERSONS FOR THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY AND THE WHITE HOUSE SAID THAT THE REPORT WAS ERRONEOUS AND MISLEADING. OFFICIALS FROM F.E.M.A. WERE ALSO TIGHT-LIPPED, BUT THE WHITE HOUSE PROMISED AN OFFICIAL STATEMENT WOULD BE MADE SHORTLY. DEMONSTRATIONS ABOUT THE LACK OF ACTION BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES HAS GRIPPED MOST MAJOR CITIES, WITH SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA HAVING THE MOST SERIOUS CLASHES BETWEEN CIVILIANS AND THE MILITARY. WILL YOU LOOK AT THAT? MAN. I WISH WE'D HAD MORE TIME. THERE'S SO MUCH MORE I WANT TO KNOW. THAT'S THE CITY. - AT THIS POINT, THE SUPERNOVA IS ALMOST ACADEMIC. THE FIRES AND THE SMOKE POSE A MUCH MORE IMMEDIATE DANGER, AND IF CONDITIONS DON'T IMPROVE… WE'RE IN FOR A VERY BAD TIME INDEED. - ARE YOU SAYING WE WON'T SURVIVE ANOTHER FIREBALL EVENT? WE MAY SURVIVE THE FIREBALLS, NOT THE FIRES. REMEMBER THE OIL FIRES AFTER DESERT STORM? REMEMBER THE INDONESIAN FOREST FIRES? WELL, AFTER A FEW DAYS, MOST OF OUR SUNLIGHT WON'T BE ABLE TO REACH GROUND LEVEL. NUCLEAR WINTER. AFTER A FEW WEEKS, WE MAY SEE TEMPERATURES STABILIZE AT 15 TO 20 DEGREES BELOW ZERO. AND THAT'S WORLDWIDE. AND THEY'LL STAY DOWN THERE FOR MONTHS, MAYBE EVEN YEARS. YES, BASICALLY, WE'RE LOOKING AT A MASS EXTINCTION EVENT. WE'LL BE JOINING THE DINOSAURS BEFORE THE SUPERNOVA EVER HAPPENS. THIS SORT OF EVENT OCCURS ONCE IN A STAR'S LIFE. THERE'S NO STOPPING IT. THE ONLY THING STRONG ENOUGH TO SAVE US… IS THE EARTH HERSELF. DAMN. SOLAR INTERFERENCE? YEAH, EITHER THAT, OR THE RELAY TOWERS ARE DOWN. EITHER WAY, IT'S NOT GOOD. LET'S NOT ASSUME THE WORST. WHAT'D YOU SAY? LET'S NOT ASSUME THE WORST. ASSUMPTIONS CAN BE WRONG. AUSTIN'S PREDICTIONS WERE BASED ON A STUDY THAT I DID SURROUNDING A GRAVITATIONAL FIELD… ASTEROID 460. IS IT NEAR THE SUN? MY NUMBERS RIGHT HERE. CHENISLAV WAS CONVINCED THAT MY ASSUMPTION WAS WRONG, THAT IS WHY HE HIGHLIGHTED IT. IF MY NUMBER IS WRONG, EVERYTHING THAT COMES AFTER IT IS ALSO WRONG. I HAVE TO GET TO S.P.L. CHRISTOPHER. THIS COUNTRY IS COUNTING ON US TO BE ON THE BALL, PEOPLE. NOW, I KNOW THIS ALL SEEMS INSURMOUNTABLE. BUT UNTIL WE ARE WIPED OUT, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO TRY TO CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN SOME SORT OF ORDER. THE PEOPLE IN THE FIELD… THOSE PEOPLE OUT THERE… NEED US TO ORGANIZE THINGS, AND THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT THERE IS ORDER AT THE TOP, OR THEY WILL FALL APART. IF THAT HAPPENS, ALL MAY BE LOST. NOW, LET'S GET BACK AT IT, OK? CAPTAIN. THAT ORDER I GAVE EARLIER… APPLIES TO PEOPLE TRYING TO LEAVE, AS WELL. NO ONE GETS IN. NO ONE GETS OUT. THESE PEOPLE HAVE FAMILIES OUT THERE. WE ALL HAVE FAMILIES OUT THERE, CAPTAIN. WE FALTER, AND EVERYONE WILL SUFFER. ARE WE CLEAR? ABSOLUTELY. GOOD. THAT'S TO THE WEST OF THE CITY. OH, MY GOD. THAT'S RIGHT WHERE MARSHALL'S HOSPITAL IS. I CAN'T STAY HERE. NOT NOW. GINNY… WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE. YOU MIGHTN'T GET WITHIN MILES OF THE AREA. IT COULD BE DANGEROUS. I REALLY HOPE I SEE YOU AGAIN. SOMEHOW. YOU DID GOOD, GINNY. WE BOTH DID. AND NOW IT'S YOUR TIME. GOOD LUCK. COME ON! GET ON. GET HIS BLEEDING STOPPED. HEY, COLE. LOOKY, LOOKY. BEAUTY, HUH? HEY, COLE. LOOK, UH… WE NEED TO TALK. COLE? HELLO? YOU GOTTA DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO, BUT I'VE GOT TO HAVE SOME FUN BEFORE I GET CALLED BACK HOME. ALL RIGHT, THEN. OOF! DR. LEWIS! MARY ANN! IT'S ME, GINNY McKILLIP. YEAH…I KNOW. - WHERE IS MARSHALL? - DON'T KNOW. DR. LEWIS, YOU'RE HURT. OKAY, UM, YOU'RE JUST GONNA SIT DOWN. DR. LEWIS. WE… WE NEED TO… LET'S GET YOU OFF YOUR FEET. MARSHALL! OH, MY GOD, MARSHALL! I WAS SO AFRAID. IT'S ALL RIGHT NOW. WE'RE BOTH GONNA BE ALL RIGHT. BUT IT'S SO TERRIBLE, MARSHALL. IT'S TERRIBLE… IT'S OKAY. WE'LL STAY HERE. OKAY, THEN. MY NAME'S GINNY. - WHAT'S YOURS? - CASSIDY. OKAY, CASSIDY. I'M SCARED TOO, BUT EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE JUST FINE. ALL SET. IT'S GONNA LINK UP TO ANY NEWS SITE OR BLOG OR WEB SITE STILL IN EXISTENCE. YOU WANT TO DO THE HONORS? ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HIT "SEND" RIGHT THERE. MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T. WHAT GOOD WILL IT DO? IT'LL LET PEOPLE KNOW THE TRUTH. WILL THAT HELP THEM? IT'S… IT'S NOT GOING TO HELP SAVE THEM, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN. THEN WHAT'S THE POINT? HMM? I'VE SPENT MY ENTIRE CAREER BELIEVING THAT PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW. NO MATTER HOW PAINFUL, THE TRUTH HAS TO COME OUT, AND I'D DO ANYTHING TO GET IT. ANYTHING. I'VE LOST FRIENDS, LOVERS. NOTHING ELSE MATTERED TO ME AS MUCH AS FINDING OUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED, WHO REALLY DID IT, WHAT WAS BEHIND IT ALL. AND LETTING AS MANY PEOPLE AS I COULD KNOW ABOUT IT. BUT NOW… I'VE COME FACE-TO-FACE WITH A DIFFERENT KIND OF TRUTH. WHAT GOOD DOES IT DO TO KNOW? WHAT CAN ANYONE DO ABOUT IT? IT'S A TRUTH THAT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER ANYMORE. ALL IT CAN DO IS MAKE MATTERS WORSE. MAYBE NOT. STEP AWAY, MALCOLM. YOU TOO, DAVE. SINGH. I KNOW WHO YOU WORK FOR, REMEMBER. SAME EMPLOYER YOU DO, AS I RECALL. EXCEPT I QUIT. GOOD FOR YOU. I JUST GOT FIRED. WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR, CHRIS? THE TRUTH. ONE THAT MIGHT MATTER A LOT. MR. MILLER. SIR… NATIONAL GUARD'S FIGHTING A LOSING BATTLE. EVERY POLICEMAN, FIREMAN, MARSHAL, DEPUTY AGENT WE HAVE ISN'T ENOUGH. RIOTS ARE SPIRALING OUT OF CONTROL. PULL ALL UNITS BACK TO COMMAND CENTERS. ORDER THE COMMANDERS TO EXPAND THEIR RESOURCES TO PROTECT FOOD DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, PUBLIC UTILITIES, AND ARMORIES. LET THEM HAVE THE LIQUOR STORES, SUPERMARKETS, MALLS, AND THE LIKE. IF WE LIVE THROUGH THIS, WE'LL NEED FOOD, WATER, DEFENSE STOCKPILES, AND POWER TO SETTLE THINGS. AT THIS TIME, WE ARE STRUGGLING TO REMAIN ON THE AIR. WE AREN'T EVEN SURE IF ANYONE IS SEEING THESE BROADCASTS, BUT THE STAFF HAS VOWED TO STAY ON THE AIR FOR AS LONG AS WE CAN. WITH ONLY SCATTERED REPORTS STILL COMING IN, WE CAN SAY WITH CERTAINTY, THE SCOPE OF THE DESTRUCTION HAS BEEN MASSIVE. FIRE AND RESCUE CREWS HAVE BEEN WORKING TIRELESSLY WITH THE HELP OF THE MILITARY WORLDWIDE TO NOT ONLY DEAL WITH THE DESTRUCTION, BUT THEY HAVE BEEN DESPERATELY TRYING TO MAINTAIN ORDER, TO LITTLE EFFECT. CASUALTY REPORTS HAVE TOPPED WELL OVER SEVERAL MILLION, AND THOSE ESTIMATES ARE HOURS OLD. SHEPARD ISN'T WRONG, CHRISTOPHER. THERE'S NO WAY HE'S WRONG. WE SHREDDED HIS FIGURES TILL THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT. YEAH, BUT YOU DIDN'T SHRED MINE. KEEP GOING. LET'S GO, CHRISTOPHER. TIME FOR YOU TO GO HOME. NO, IT'S…IT'S HERE. I KNOW IT'S HERE. I JUST HAVEN'T SEEN… CHRISTOPHER. YOUR WIFE, YOUR DAUGHTER. BUT WHAT IF I'M RIGHT? WHAT IF YOU'RE NOT? DISPERSE IMMEDIATELY AND RETURN TO YOUR HOMES. DISPERSE IMMEDIATELY! PREPARE YOURSELVES! DISPERSE IMMEDIATELY AND RETURN TO YOUR HOMES. DISPERSE IMMEDIATELY AND RETURN TO YOUR HOMES. I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT. I THINK WE SHOULD JUST LEAVE BAD ENOUGH ALONE. THAT'S A MISTAKE. THIS IS A PLUS SIGN RIGHT HERE. IT SHOULDN'T BE A PLUS. WAIT…PLUS X OVER 2 TIMES RHO. TELL ME THIS IS GOOD. THAT'S PE = H TO THE SECOND OVER 20 x Em N E OVER EmH x 3 OVER PI x EMH TO THE POWER OF 2/3 TIMES ONE PLUS X OVER 2 TIMES RHO… MINUS X OVER 2 x RHO. MINUS X, NOT PLUS X. WHOO! YOU ARE KIDDING ME. WHAT'S GOING ON? UH, A PLUS SIGN. A STUPID LITTLE PLUS SIGN. WHERE A MINUS SHOULD HAVE BEEN. THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT? TELL ME THAT'S GOOD? OH, YEAH. IT'S GOOD. I HAVE NEVER BEEN THIS HAPPY TO BE RIGHT ABOUT BEING WRONG. AUSTIN'S WHOLE THEORY WAS BASED ON RESEARCH HE ASKED ME TO DO. BUT MY PROJECTIONS WERE OFF, FRACTIONALLY. I PUT A PLUS SIGN WHERE A MINUS SIGN SHOULD HAVE BEEN. AUSTIN WAS WORKING FROM A FAILED PREMISE. I MEAN, IF MY CONCLUSIONS WERE WRONG, SO WERE HIS. THIS ALL BOILS DOWN TO A PLUS SIGN? SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW? NOW… YOU HAVE A TRUTH THAT'S WORTH REPORTING. AND I HAVE A WIFE AND A DAUGHTER THAT I HAVE TO GET BACK TO. SO I GUESS THIS IS WHERE WE PART COMPANY. I'LL GO WITH YOU. WE'VE COME THIS FAR. LET'S MAKE SURE AT LEAST ONE OF US GETS HOME. BOUND TO HAPPEN. WHEN YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT NOTHING TO LOSE… IS THERE ANOTHER WAY WE CAN GO? IT'S GONNA BE THE SAME ANYWHERE WE GO. WHOA! AHH! HA HA HA! GET EM' OUT! CHRISTOPHER! GET OFF! - CHRISTOPHER! - LET ME GO! OOF! UNH! OW! UNH! BACK OFF! BACK OFF! I SAID BACK OFF! GET IN. UNH! UGH! OH! I THINK YOU BETTER DRIVE. OHH! OH! IT'S FINE. I JUST NEED SOME AIR. - GOD! - I CAN'T BREATHE. OH! LOOK, I HAVE TO GO GET SOME HELP, OK? JUST STAY RIGHT HERE, AND I'LL BE BACK. NO! DON'T LEAVE ME. OH! I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO MEETING YOUR WIFE AND KID. OH, DON'T TALK LIKE THAT. YOU'RE GOING TO BE FINE, OK? I'M GOING TO GET YOU IN THE TRUCK. WE'RE GOING TO GET UP OUT OF HERE, OK? - LET'S GO. COME ON. - AAH! OH! YOU'RE A GOOD MAN, CHRISTOPHER. SCIENTISTS AT S.P.L. ARE NOW CONVINCED THERE WAS A FATAL ERROR IN THE ORIGINAL EQUATIONS THAT DR. SHEPARD USED TO COMPLETE HIS ANALYSIS OF THE AGE OF THE SUN. ACCORDING TO DR. MALCOLM HANDEY OF S.P.L., WHO'S HERE WITH ME NOW, THIS MEANS THAT EARLIER PREDICTIONS OF A SUPERNOVA EVENT OVER THE NEXT WEEKS OR MONTH HAVE BEEN BASED ON INCONSISTENT DATA. ACCORDING TO OUR LATEST ANALYSIS, THE RECENT DEVASTATING SOLAR ACTIVITY WILL ABATE OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS. BUT WE ARE NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET, AS WE STILL HAVE TO CONTAIN… YES, SIR, WE HAVE THE SAME TRANSMISSION. YES, ORIGINATION AT S.P.L. IS CONFIRMED. YES, SIR, BUT I STRONGLY ADVISE CONTINUATION OF PHOENIX'S OPERATIONAL STATUS UNTIL WE FIND HANDEY AND ANALYZE WHAT HE KNOWS. SIR, WE HAVE AN INVESTMENT HERE. I DON'T THINK IT'S PRUDENT TO CANCEL THE GAME BEFORE WE HAVE THE TEAMS ON THE FIELD, SIR. YES, SIR. I UNDERSTAND. YES, SIR. BROOKE? HALEY? LINDA'S COTTAGE. BROOKE? BROOKE! I WONDER HOW BAD WE GOT IT. I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT, UH, WHAT MANKIND DID TO ITSELF IN 2 WORLD WARS, THE SUN MANAGED TO DO IN A FEW DAYS. MILLIONS DEAD. CITIES IN RUINS. CIVIL ORDER DESTROYED. WELL, WE COULD HAVE GOTTEN OFF WORSE, I SUPPOSE. THIS IS MILLER AT N.C.C. I NEED TO SPEAK TO THE PRESIDENT. YES. OH, YES. I'LL HOLD. OH! WHOA! OH, MY GOD. - OH, CHRIS. OH, CHRIS. - LINDA? - I'M SORRY. - IT'S OK. I JUST SAW THE HEADLIGHTS… LIN, WHERE'S BROOKE? - DADDY! - OH! HALEY. OH, HONEY. I COULDN'T REACH YOU. I WAS SO SCARED. IT'S ALL RIGHT. EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? THAT'S…IT'S A LONG STORY. I'LL TELL YOU LATER. IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT, BROOKE. I TOLD HER TO LEAVE. I TOLD HER NOT TO STAY THERE. WE CAN'T TELL HER. NOT NOW. SHE LOVED TERESA. I KNOW. HE'S COMING, CHRIS. HE DOES NOT KNOW WHERE YOU ARE. SHE COULD HAVE TOLD HIM. HE COULD HAVE MADE HER TELL HIM. HE'LL KILL US ALL IF HE GETS THE CHANCE. THEN WE'RE NOT STAYING HERE. WE CAN'T GO HOME. THE CITY'S OUT OF CONTROL. YOU SAW WHAT IT'S LIKE. EVEN WHEN WORD GETS OUT ABOUT THE SUPERNOVA, IT COULD TAKE WEEKS FOR THINGS TO SETTLE DOWN. THEN WE'RE DEFINITELY BETTER OFF ON THE RUN. NO. WE'RE NOT GONNA RUN. WE'VE LOST SO MUCH TIME BECAUSE OF THAT BASTARD. HE'S STOLEN IT FROM US. HE'S STOLEN MY LIFE FROM ME, AND I CAN'T LET HIM HAVE ANYMORE. WHAT IF YOU'RE RIGHT? WHAT IF HE DID GET TO TERESA? HE'LL COME HERE. THEN LET HIM. LEAVE SOME SOAP FOR THE REST OF US! I WILL. AH, I MISSED YOU SO MUCH. I WAS SO STUPID. SHE'S IN THE BATH. I SAW HIM! HE'S HERE! I SAW HIM! WHO, HONEY? WHAT? THAT MAN! H-HE WAS STANDING AT THE WINDOW OUTSIDE THE BATHROOM, LOOKING AT ME! ARE YOU SURE, HONEY? THERE WAS SOMEONE THERE, DAD. IT WAS HIM. OH, DAMN THAT GENERATOR. ALWAYS DOES THIS. WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN THIS HAPPENS? WELL, YOU START IT LIKE A LAWNMOWER. WHERE IS IT? BY THE GAZEBO. NO, CHRIS. WE'RE VULNERABLE IN HERE WITH NO ELECTRICITY. YOU STAY HERE, WAIT TILL I COME BACK. YEAH, BUT WHAT IF HE'S REALLY OUT THERE? TAKE THE GUN. TAKE THE GUN, CHRIS. OOF! BROOKE. IT'S ME. UNH! UNH! AAH! OHH! OOF! AAH! UNH! WHERE'S THAT NICE, PRETTY LITTLE GIRL, BROOKE? WHERE IS HALEY? I'M GOING TO START WITH HER. ARGH! UGH! OH! AAH! UNH! GET BACK, HALEY! DON'T COME DOWN HERE! AAH! OH! MOM! OK, COLE. YOU WANT IT? YOU COME AND GET IT. ARE YOU MAN ENOUGH, COLE? UNH! OOF! AAH! OH! AAH! UGH! OHH. UNH! ARGH! AAH! IT'S OVER. IT'S OVER. NURSE? YOU'RE OKAY. YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE. THE DOCTOR'S GONNA BE WITH YOU SOON. YOU GOTTA SEE THIS. * IT'S RAINING, IT'S POURING * * THE OLD MAN IS SNORING * * HE WENT TO BED AND BUMPED HIS HEAD * * AND COULDN'T GET UP IN THE MORNING * OK. WELL DONE. MOM. DAD. DID HE HURT YOU? ARE YOU OK? IS HE GONE? IT APPEARS THAT THE RAIN IS A WORLDWIDE PHENOMENON, DOUSING THE FIRES THAT HAVE OVERWHELMED OUR EMERGENCY PERSONNEL, AS WELL AS MOST OF THE FOREST FIRES THAT WERE TOO REMOTE FOR ANYONE TO REACH. IN THE PAST THREE WEEKS, MAJOR RAINFALL ACROSS THE PLANET HAS CLEANSED THE AIR. THE EARTH IS HEALING ITSELF. ACRE BY ACRE, COUNTRY BY COUNTRY, CONTINENT BY CONTINENT, MOTHER EARTH HAS DONE FOR MANKIND WHAT IT COULDN'T POSSIBLY DO FOR ITSELF. OUR FIERCE AND TERRIFYING SUN HAS FINALLY CALMED ITSELF. LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE IN THIS VAST UNIVERSE, IT WILL DIE, BUT NOT NOW… NOT FOR A LONG TIME. ONLY 3 WEEKS AGO, WE STOOD ON THE BRINK OF EXTINCTION. WE WITNESSED THE DARK SIDE OF HUMAN NATURE. WE SAW RIOTS AND LOOTING. WE SAW SELFISHNESS AND DISREGARD FOR ONE ANOTHER. BUT, WORST OF ALL, WE LEARNED THAT THERE ARE THOSE WHO WOULD LEAVE THE REST OF US BEHIND. WITH THE TWISTED LOGIC OF SOCIAL DARWINISM, AN EXCLUSIONARY NOAH'S ARK ALMOST SET SAIL. THIS STORY HAS YET TO BE TOLD, BUT IT WILL BE. IN THE MEANTIME, LET'S NEVER FORGET THAT WE HAVE SUFFERED TREMENDOUS LOSS. BUT WE GO ON. WE HAVE LEARNED, PERHAPS MORE THAN EVER BEFORE, THAT WE ARE INDEED FRAGILE. THINK ANYONE'LL BELIEVE HER? WOULD YOU? RIGHT. JUST ANOTHER FANTASY FOR THE CONSPIRACY THEORISTS. WELL, TRANSPORT'S WAITING OUTSIDE. LOOK. COME ON. ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO. COME ON OVER, HALEY. IT'S TIME TO EAT. HALEY, COME SIT DOWN. COMING! Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
