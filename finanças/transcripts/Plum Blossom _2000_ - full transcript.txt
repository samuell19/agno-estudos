Do what? Eat, sleep, screw, and go to school The same as always. Should I go to the army like Wonjae? Do you wanna die? In the thick falling snow, the baby quails come with the voice It's all right. It's all right It's all right. In the endless snow, even the mountain, the blue mountain never bothers the saying... It's all right. It's all right... It's all right. Dear Teacher... I still miss my friend June who died when we were kids I realized being a grown-up is having your friends leave and then being alone Jayo is the only one left Okay, for ten minutes. Okay Jayo is confused all the time. Although, he always indulges in decadence he doesn't get close to others I'm... still the same Like you wanted, I'm trying hard to forget you Until I can forget, I'll keep sending letters to you But by the hundreth letter, maybe things will get better Teacher, what's wrong? Hey, Jayo! If you wanna hear this song, then listen to this one first In the beginning of his career, Don McLean entitled the song Vincent' after Vincent Van Gogh Then Roberta Flack heard it over the radio. It touched her soul so she made that other song What's wrong? I have class I've got to go now Wait When can we meet again? See you later Bad boy Why were you absent? Give me three good reasons From the psychological view First, I was bored Second, I wanted to have sex Third, as much as I can Okay? What about Madam Werther? From the psychological view. That's very logical and reasonable. And also practical. Excuse me! What? Do you mind taking my virginity? Seuin... Should I get angry? Or slap him on the cheek? But what should I do? I don't feel angry Open the door Open it...! Who let Jeannie out of her lamp? Kiss me... So then? How many times did you do it with her? That girl from your high school Did you do it like this? How was it? Was it good? It was okay... Thief! Then why did you break up with her? She's dead. Dead? How come? Take off your shirt first I can't wait. I'll do it. Don't rush! I can't help it. No, not there. You're not leaving? I'm off duty today. Why don't you ask anything about me? You're not curious? No Well, I am Like your dreams and thoughts during high school Well, except for that girl I know! It's cause you forget my number, right? Bad boy Did it hurt your pride? Wanna do it again? Is it all right having sex with me? I choose the guy myself. Men don't control me. So that's why you named your cafe Werther? Goethe's probably jealous. Because Werther is dead, and so is Goethe But... we're still alive It's all right... It's all right... Are you all right? I think so Seuin! Seuin! Seuin... Falling plum blossoms in the wind the full moon at early night the barley field turning yellow... She loved these things. I suddenly thought about her while having sex I was thinking of her Dear Teacher, I feel lost I can't move a step forward. Since Jayo is lost too, it makes matters worse If I stand here for a while, I feel like I'm flying through air and looking down on the world As if I'm even looking down on myself. I agree Wanna jump? Why not? Hey Seuin! Hey Jayo! How far do we have to go till Jayo and I find our way? I want to know. And most of all... I miss you What do you think? Don't you wanna see her? Seuin's in love with another woman Really? But why don't you ever talk about her? Is it some tragic love of some kind? It would be fun if we could double date When we're drunk, we could change partners You're nasty Seuin, he's beyond remedy. All he does is sleep and have sex Jayo's got a straw for sucking human blood Long ago, a girl was sucked by his straw and vanished I know that story. So don't fall in love If you don't then you won't get hurt, right? I agree! I'm not I'll fall in love, but I'll never get hurt I can do it. Did Jayo say that he loves you? Didn't he say that love is love, and sex is sex? Tell me three of your emotional states from the psychological view First, I'm horny Second, horny beyond remedy Third, everlastingly horny beyond remedy I don't love this guy yet. You're dirty Nothing but a walking disease You gonna keep avoiding the madam? Sex... It's compliated Whenever I do it with her, I keep seeing Junghae's face It's beyond remedy And you? Are you getting serious with Namok? I don't know She's comfortable to be with, but it's sometimes hard Yeah... sex... It's complicated. Son of a bitch! Let go of me! Stop it! What's wrong with you? Let go of me! Get off! Pull yourself together! Did you know? A person can't posess another. I know it well! Yeah! I know it well! Take me! Take all of me! Take me! It's me, Jayo. Can I come over? I don't wanna sleep alone. Seuin... he disappeared Your lunch set is ready. Thank you I did you a favor, and fries is how you repay me? What else do you want? Is Seuin back? - The biscuits are ready - Okay! Here's your double set, sir. Hey, why do you have to make money? I told you I'm on my own. Seuin used to helped me out. I can do the same Aren't you going home? You're upset, aren't you? When you get angry, it reminds me of my dead father Is that why you slept with me? Cause I look like your father? Maybe I orignally wanted to work in pediatrics and treat cute kids But I got stuck in urology. Having to stick shots in guys' butts It's unfair. Know what? Would you believe that I saw a lot of guys' things? You must have loved it. Do you masturbate like other guys? Doesn't everybody? After you met me too? - Two cokes, please - Yes mam! Yeah, maybe Like it? Don't you feel like loving me more and more? It's a present It hurts Are you also hurt by your past love like Seuin? Are you? That's why you're not interested in me? Of course not. I'm doing it with you now That's what I mean. Can't you do more than this? I've never thought about it. Don't press down. It hurts. You've never thought about it? Don't use this today. Give it to me. - No - Come on No. Just do without it I can bear three sons who look like you You're crazy But I won't tell them who their father is Not a bad deal I forgot today's my mom's birthday Did I tell you my mom and I live apart? Namok! Yeah, go ahead. Do you wanna stop meeting? I'd like to How about you? I'm really late Bye - Why - You guys go first Bye Seuin How... have you been? Are you all right now? I can't deal with it. I can't anymore. I can't stand it. I can't do anything without thinking about you I've been floating like a ghost When I think about you I can't even breathe I can't stand it any longer Don't write to me any more You're still too young Go back and start over again. What sidedish do you want? You're not drinking? Anything you can cook quickly If you want more, cook it yourself You're not leaving? Shit! How can I leave my drink here? You wanted to come here? Well, I don't understand why you have to drink Sometimes I don't feel like doing anything Not going to work, forgetting everything and have sex all the time Don't you think it's wonderful? Doesn't sound bad Do whatever you fuckin want! Get out of here! Let go of me! Get out of here! - Get out! - Let go of me! Do whatever! Get out of here! Get out! That woman is my mom. You said you wanted to break up? If that's what you want, then go ahead There's nothing I can do. I'll be all right. Were you okay? You bastard! Pick one of the three reasons why you came back First, because you had nowhere to go Second, for no special reason. Third... Because you missed me. It's probably... for no special reason How about a drink? - Now? - Right now. This instant That way we have more time to drink You're crazy. But it doesn't sound bad Are you all right? I'm all right. How about you? Yeah... I'm all right. Wanna run? Yeah! You're not running? It's all right! It's all right! Happy birthday to you! Wait a minute! Why aren't you tough like a man? A man should down the first shot, right? Asshole. I'm closed today Why are you so upset? I've got some money today Close the door! I've done nothing for Namok. She supported herself and became a nurse All I've done is fed her and gave her a place Was it a month ago? She left here to be on her own. Then she came back again. You slept with her, didn't you? Well, I... You're not just using her, right? If that's all, then take your hands off That's what a man should do You've misunderstood... Okay then. You can go now. Someone who gets hurt, always hurts another What are you waiting for? Didn't I tell you to go? She's drunk out of her mind. Women sure know how to drink if they want to From the psychological view, I think we're all garbage. You're at it again. She got into grad school. Had to congratulate her. Now it's all right. Everything's all right. The hardest thing to deal with was fighting myself I wanna get this fight over with. Even though I quit, I hope you keep fighting till the end Cause Jayo... you're my alter ego and my hope Junghae Yoon Bastard! Coward! You're only a walking sex disease... You thought I couldn't wait? Of course I can wait for you You're nothing, but a coward who can't love Bad boy... Where are you? I came to your place to start things over I told you, right? I don't wanna get hurt. I'm not stepping outside until you come back not one step From now on think about how you'll live Forget everything and live, okay? The confusion we went through at the threshold of our twenties It wasn't all about sex. Okay... I have to stop Now it's time to open my mind Jayo? It's Jayo, right? Jayo Jayo! Namok! I miss you. Namok! Namok, I... I'm coming to you... Namok, I'm coming back right now
