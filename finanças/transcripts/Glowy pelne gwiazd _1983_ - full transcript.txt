HEADS FULL OF STARS Hi. Remember me? I’m all grown up. Is the cinema closed? It’s open. Mother still runs it. The Boss? She does? Is that guy a friar, too? Dear God, no. I think I’m going to cry. Definitely. And whose hen is this? - Is this yours, young man? - Boss, ma'am… -Would you like to stay here? - What? They took all our men away, and now they keep coming here to watch movies. Movies? You don’t have lice, do you? That’s fine. Let’s kill the hen and cook a wonderful dinner. Don’t worry, we’ll surely die of fear. DIE DEUTSCHE WOCHENSCHAU (German newsreel) THE END I have ask… I have told… I have explain… and I have demand! Donnerwetter, noch einmal! (Again, Goddamnit) Anything fun? What movie is this? Tragedy, comedy, romance? It’s Kraut movies, Miss. Just Kraut. I’ll watch just for a while then. Here! Thank you. This tramp won’t miss a single screening. Why are there no real men around here? And I mean, real men! They would show her her place. They’d knock some sense into her! They’d avenge me! - Right? They’d just take a hot iron… - Come on! That’s right! She’s an insult to my honour! Ghost… Ghost, give us a sign. It moved! I didn’t touch it! It’s the ground that moved. Cannons! What are we going to do? A striped pullover. - That’s for your fiancée. - I don’t have one. You will. The future will be decided by the ones who show up here and take over. They’ll come here armed to the teeth, they’ll send their troops, and they’re done! Take this instead of the deposit. The Cumaean Sibyl says: „A lion in the West along with a rooster will lead a youngster to sit on a throne! The three sides of the world will place a crown on a Cracow’s misfits head!” I would spank that Sibyl on the bare bottom! 10 times! - If I could... - Quiet, you! The ghost is about to communicate! C-O… C-O… cock-a-doodle-doo? It’s the hen’s spirit! Missus Bekiesińska, it’s simply trying to tell us who will take power after the war. C-O... Who’s it going to be? CO-mmunists, of course! Stop squeaking! Me? - What have you got there? - A hat. - Should we knock? - Are you stupid? We’re on a mission! - What is this?! - Don’t move! For collaborating with the occupation forces… we sentence you… Gentlemen, for what? Gentlemen, please! - …you… you fascist pig… - Please, for what? …to being hit with a hose 10 times! You should’ve said so earlier. I wouldn’t humiliate myself like this. Here. Here! I can’t do it. - Your idea. - I can’t! I get to do it alone? Just great. It fell behind the couch. - Sorry... - I’ll get it. You’d scratch up my floor. Couldn’t your friend help me? It’s probably pretty painful, huh? - Don’t think so. - For sure. Try it. Not that much? That’s it, I’m done! I’m not an executioner! Your friend got upset. You must be hungry. Here. - Hey! - Oh, Jesus! It’s me, Włodek! You have been avenged! - Get lost! - Listen! We punished that woman that… you know. Get to the point! Say… You don’t like me much, do you. Tell me the truth. - Not here, not now. - Is that your last word on the matter? - Mean, vile man! - I take my leave, then! I hate you! - Ladies’ man, blabbermouth! - What are you doing?! Coming back from a mission! Vile, cruel creatures! Sleep! Ah, so you’re on her side! - Oh! - Why are you roaming around here? - I live here. - I don’t want anything from you. I brought you something. - What is this? - Lard. I couldn’t possibly accept this. - Oh, really. - Yes, really! - I don’t understand. - I don’t despise you. I swear. But this is a good of unknown origin… Unknown how? I got it from the Germans! Here, have a smoke. Doctor? Right... It starts with alcohol... Dancing... Then a date... A kiss with a stranger... …and so on and so forth. Yes, my dear sir. It’s syphilis! What movie is that? Why are you turning it off? They’re in love. With each other. - But it’s kind of tragic, really. - I’m not interested at all. I wanted to tell you… I just came to inform you that I am ashamed for you. Look at who’s with your lard-devouring friend. Goddamn vigilantes. Włodek… be careful. Take this and get me some new tapes. Make sure they give you extra good stuff! A lot of dancing, singing, and jokes. - Dancing? - Maybe a romance. - I understand. - Don’t take anything sad. They don’t make sad movies nowadays, anyway. Ladies and gentlemen! In 100 years, they’ll make a coloured movie about the terrible times we live in! Keep an eye on him. He could get hurt. Don’t you worry. Leave it to me. If they have some... you know… exotic revues... - They’re shooting. - Yeah, they sure are. So you want me to get the exotic stuff, too? What did you think, jackass? We have a name to uphold. Open up! Quiet! I hear you! Włodek, the Germans are escaping! Open up! In the name of the local population I demand to know what’s going on. Good morning. - We want an exchange. - What kind? - Trousers. - What kind? A suit. A shirt. Trousers. They want clothing! Pants! Get them some clothes, quick! Hands up! - Hands up! - Calm that idiot down. Come here, boy. One moment. Put your hands down. I’ve known you since you were a child. What you’re doing is honourable, but in this situation we have to go in tactically. Trousers, coat, suit. Now, "raus!" from our town! I better never see you around here again! Never again! Hitler kaput! I’m also happy that Hitler is kaput, but now you can leave. I never want to see you again. You can’t stay here. We have no food to feed you with. We surrender! The Geneva Convention! The Geneva Convention? You’re thinking of a different war! Go to Hell! Zum Teufel! To Hell! One moment! You hide us, we give you prima potato! I, a military Christian chaplain, started the war with a rabbi and a pope by my side, I don’t mind adding a Lutheran to that list. What about me? I’m just supposed to accept this? You guys take some Germans prisoner, and I’m supposed to cook for them?! Hey, clean it more thoroughly! Look, like so. Gut. We have to keep this place sparkling clean. Sara Lander! Annabella! Laura La Plante. Marlena. Ramón Novarro. Barrymore. - Girls! - Was? Girls! Metro Golden Meyer! Hollywood! Fred Astaire! Prima! Quiet, stop stomping! Barrymore. La Palma. What are you staring at? He thinks… You think, you worm, that I can’t… That I, in this situation, in these circumstances, that I’d be able to tap-dance?! Hitler kaput! Barrymore! La Palma… Wait, wait, one moment! Barrymore… Barrymore… People! More Germans! Run, people, run! Halt! Halt! - Quiet! - Why quiet, why? What are you doing? Pretending to be a hen? A hen! Dinner’s ready. Jacket potatoes. You and your “quiet”! Shut up, look! Hello! (speaking Hungarian) Magyar-friend! Home! Benzin! Baratok! (Friend.) What are you doing? Let me go! Quiet, quiet! Quiet! Are you happy? We have 8 people under us. Too bad it’s not 80. Listen, Włodek. I can’t do it… So could you bring us some of those potatoes? They’ll eat everything. Come, boy, drink with us! Nein. I’m responsible for everyone. Come down! Come on! Please! - Why is she so popular with them? - Who knows what it is. So purity is not important anymore? You know… It’s complicated. It’s like that sometimes. You know… Men… Real men… that is to say... degenerates! They really like rotten women like her. Stop standing around like that! Please, get down from there! You’re under arrest! Get down! What do you want?! Włodek! I’ve been looking for you. Is something the matter? Yes. No. I ran from there. I need to tell you something that will be of great interest to you. But not in here. You tore my armband. Take that off! - Heart-eater! - There’s someone up there! Shame on you! What did you want to tell me? Can you keep a secret? You’re asking me that? I don’t know… I can’t tell you… - I might die… - I know it’s difficult to confess. You really… wouldn’t tell anyone? - Because I... - Because you... - I wanted to ask you… - Yes, of course, sorry, I know, but you can always count on me. I wanted to ask you to… - play a movie. - A movie? Meine Liebe! (Ger.: My love.) A movie… That’s a wonderful thing. She loves him, he loves her. - But she doesn’t know that he... - No, no that movie! I know, another one! She loves him, but she loses her memories, and he makes a wonderful career during that time. No, not that one either. The one… I saw back then… - Doctor? - Right... It starts with alcohol… Dancing... Then a date... A kiss with a stranger… And so on, and so forth… Come here, come here! Look! Look, how romantic! There’s stars! - Stars? - Stars. (Russian) Good machine! I prayed, and I prayed, and God has finally sent you to us. (Rus.) A new offensive has begun. Without the help of the Poles it wouldn’t have made it far. (Rus.) We’ll come back to this later. The most important thing right now is to put an end to this war. Push it, boys! I started out on a horse. What are you? A soldier, too? (Rus.) Yes, a soldier. I started out on a horse, I remember it like it was yesterday, the enemy in front of me… That was a long time ago. Now I drive this. An Austrian circus before the war… But Russians and Hungarians on a German bike… - I’ve never seen that one before. - There were monkeys on a line! It’s all his fault! He pretends to be an adult. - He was born too late! - Or too early! I don’t know what’ll happen next. What’s going to happen, father? Who could tell, missus Bekiesińska. I’m not the all-knowing Holy Ghost! (Rus.) Any road that leads home is a good road. (Rus.) You’re really lucky. Me and him? Lucky? - This is for you. - Too bad about the bike. But thank you. You’re in charge now. Us? Who would believe that! Here’s your authorisation. Take one, too! Why didn’t you take the rifle? I’m not going back to the cinema. The men are back! We bring you freedom and democracy! Together we can change the world! Jury! Jurek! Wait! Wait! Think about this! LAND FOR FARMERS CINEMA “DAWN” Madam! Is there anything to do around-… You play movies around here? - Me? - Don’t you speak Polish? - I don’t have anything! - And you’re happy about that? Are you with or against us? I only work here in the cinema… I play whatever I get. Excuse me? I… only… All you need to say is “yes” or “no”. Yes or no? - Where are you going, boy? - I’m getting a movie. It’s a comedy. A Soviet comedy! For what?! Włodek! Are you okay? Włodek! What’s wrong? Stop playing. Let’s talk. Nothing to talk about. Okay, well… How is everyone? How do you think? I’m on a mission. Good for you. You’ll get it someday. Anders will come on his white horse and rip your legs off, just you wait… Don’t worry, Włodek. We lived through many things, we’ll live through this, too. Now, sit! Show me. You’ll be fine. I brought your payment. The last one. - Listen. What a beautiful sound. - Thank you. Don’t worry about this. They’ll nationalise cinema soon. They look wonderful, missus Bekiesińska. I’m never getting engaged. - Wanna dance? - Yes! Yes! My love, you should sing me songs for fun! My love, you should be growing in the sun! I love movies like these, ones with a happy ending! - They all end the same! - What?! - They all end… - How? The same. Worldly politics, and he still butts in… And that’s how it ends. - Why are you whispering? - Criminals, my dear! Quiet! Quiet! SPEAK ON HIS GRAVE AND BE KILLED
