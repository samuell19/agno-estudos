(Only the most popular stars are here today.) (Everything she does draws people's attention.) (It's every guy's dream girl, Seol Hyun.) He is being very careful about what he says. - That's good. - He's a good dancer. You have said that T.O.P is like your mentor. - Suho? - His real name is Jun Myeon. As for Byun Yo Han, I had no idea he would become successful. You need a scolding. - That made me feel good. - Is she a model? - It just happened that way. - Is that right? (These popular celebrities will show off their charms today.) Mister, mister. (Don't change the channel.) That was nice. (You're the Best Special starts now.) This week, we have invited celebrities... who are currently on top of the world. It's You're the Best Special. Jung Soo, why are you nodding? He must think we're talking about him. (He is preoccupied with taking a selfie with Seol Hyun.) Our first guest... gives people chills even when he is smiling. The antagonist from the drama, "Remember: War of the Son", Nam Kyu Man has visited us today on Radio Star. Namkoong Min is the best. He is a good actor, boyfriend and he's also good at getting angry. Namkoong Min is an actor who's good at everything. All right, Namkoong Min. This next guest has appeared in "Veteran", "The Beauty Inside"... - and "Tazza: The Hidden Card". - That's right. He was unfortunately overshadowed by Yoo Ah In, Park Seo Jun and T.O.P. However, everyone remembers his role as Park Nam Jung of Ssangmundong. He grabbed the viewers' attention with his acting... and shot 11 commercials. Even though he has movies to film, he has decided to... visit Radio Star first. He is the popular actor, Lee Dong Hwi. She is finally here. Her life-size cardboard cutout at telecommunications stores... around the country has made Korean men's hearts flutter. Seol Hyun is the best. She's been signed on to shoot 22 commercials. She is one of the most beautiful girls in the country... and her nickname is the "30,000,000-dollar-girl". It's Seol Hyun of AOA. Our next guest was overshadowed by Park Na Rae during his first visit. He then refused to visit us again... because he was afraid of being overshadowed. Everyone overshadows him. These days, he's often seen hanging around with Kim Sook... and has made a comeback. He has even shot a commercial as a couple with Kim Sook. He's a comedian who is famous for going bankrupt, it's Yoon Jung Soo. - Hello. - Hello. (Namkoong Min, Lee Dong Hwi, Seol Hyun and Yoon Jung Soo) It's good to have you all here. Min, please say hello to the viewers. Hello, everyone. I am Namkoong Min. - I will do my best today. - All right. This is your second time on Radio Star, right? - Yes. - He was here with Hong Jin Young. - That's right. - It was quite hectic then, right? Hong Jin Young came by earlier to cheer for you. - For me? - Yes. - Really? - I bet she was just passing by. She was here. I saw her in the hallway earlier. - I see. - Did she not say hello to you? Something's fishy. They played a married couple on a variety programme. - Have you two become estranged? - That's problematic. - Maybe she had to go somewhere. - I don't think so. I thought she was here to see you, but she didn't even say hello. That's problematic. - Maybe she didn't know I was here. - I don't think so. - That's problematic. - Did you and Jin Young fight? No, we didn't. - I heard that happens a lot. - Right. - Did you two fight? - We had an amicable relationship. Stop talking and open this bottle for me. - I can't use my arm. - My goodness. Am I your caregiver now? I can't use my arm. Let's divide the work. Bite the cap and I will turn the bottle for you. Thank you for helping me. I heard a rumour about "We Got Married". - I heard that an actress... - Go on. wanted to work with me on the show. She picked me as her partner. - Was she born in 1985? - I don't know. However, the production team refused... and that tells me she was trying to use me to garner more fame. That's what I think happened. You need to stop talking about yourself. (Stop talking about yourself.) Dong Hwi, please introduce yourself. Hello, my name is Lee Dong Hwi. I watch Radio Star all the time... because it helps me improve my acting. (Did I hear that right?) - How does the show help? - Maybe he studies how I act. - You don't act. - I act sometimes. Really? Are you an actor? How does the show help you with your acting? I focus on your tempo and timing. I am sure watching me helps him greatly. It really helps me prepare for my roles in movies. - So I want to thank the show. - All right. Are you trying to look like Dong Hwi? (They're wearing the same glasses.) I have been wearing these glasses for ages. (Laughing) I can't believe she is here. Seol Hyun. Hello, I am Seol Hyun of AOA. - I am nervous... - She is so pretty. so my voice is shaking right now. I took some herbal medicine before, but I still feel nervous. - Seol Hyun, is Seol your last name? - She's so pretty. No, Seol Hyun is my given name. My full name is Kim Seol Hyun. - Kim Seol Hyun. - Which clan do you belong to? - Kimnyeong Kim. - Kimnyeong Kim. Kim Hyeong Ja belongs to the same clan. All right. I am amazed by how much useless information Gu Ra possesses. (He is the master of useless information.) Jung Soo, it's your turn. I am a comedian who became successful in six months... and ended up shooting a commercial. I'm Yoon Jung Soo. It's nice to meet you. That introduction was used a lot in the 90s. (He is a man of the past.) It's the tone of his voice. - I did debut in April of 1992. - That's right. - I can't help it. - You have that tone of voice. I debuted in April of 1992, and Gu Ra debuted in April of 1993. - Both of you started at SBS. - Gu Ra. Gu Ra was in the second batch of recruits at SBS. - Jung Soo was in the first batch. - The very first batch. In the past, you couldn't even look me in the eye. - Jung Soo was popular back then. - I called him Senior Yoon. Senior Yoon. I was in a comedy sketch with him. It was the most ridiculous comedy sketch ever. (This is the ridiculous comedy sketch they were in.) (Jung Soo looked different back then.) (Dazed) (Gu Ra doesn't know where to look.) When people found out that Min would be appearing on Radio Star, the viewers said they wanted to see Min yelling at Gu Ra... in Nam Kyu Man's tone. A lot of people said they want to see this. - Can you do it? - Do it in Nam Kyu Man's voice. In the drama you yelled mostly at Lee Si Eon, right? Yes. I always apologised to Si Eon afterwards. So I apologise in advance. - Don't worry about it. - Say something to Gu Ra. - Don't be nervous. - We know you don't mean it. He is getting into the character. - I haven't started yet. - All right. Take your time. (His facial expression changes.) Look at his eyes. - Gu Ra. - That's scary. (Tsk tsk) You incorrigible fool. Are you hosting a lot of shows? - Yes, I am. - How much do you get paid? I can't disclose that information. Get on the floor. You need a scolding. I will give you a beating with this water bottle. I am sorry. He is good. That was satisfying. He was just acting. I know that. Tell us honestly. Are you seething inside? - You are, right? - His chin is sticking out. (His chin is sticking out.) He is an amazing actor. Gu Ra is angry. - He is angry. - Don't spill water. Wipe it. Wipe it right now. - Don't spill water. - Use your left hand. (He is a really good actor.) Min, your role in "Remember: War of the Son"... as Nam Kyu Man, a petty man with anger management issues... is the talk of the town. I heard there are unique facial expressions that Nam Kyu Man makes. Tell us more about this. I touched my face a lot when I was acting. I would touch my eyebrows before bursting out in anger... or stretch my neck like this. After hitting someone, I would... - push my tongue into my cheek. - You did that earlier. I didn't even realise I was doing these things. The character you play is an evil man. I think it would have been a good idea... - to remove your two front teeth... - Okay. like hip-hop musicians. Did you ever think about doing that? It'd be absurd for a character in a drama to have missing teeth. If you did that, we'd accept you as a comedian. It would be a nice transition. What a witty remark. (Gu Ra and Jong Shin have great teamwork.) Which one of us could play the role of Nam Kyu Man? - Jong Shin is the perfect choice. - Which one of us would it be? - I am too feeble. - No, you are not. - Jong Shin would do a good job. - I agree. I bet he is a bad man behind that smile. Yes, you're right. You judged him correctly. - You saw through him. - You're right. You judged Jong Shin's character correctly. He isn't a bad man, but he can be cold-hearted. Hey, Yoon Kyu Man. - He name is Yoon Kyu Man. - He can be cold-hearted. Do you want to look into my eyes? (He's glaring.) (He laughs like a child.) Dong Hwi, many people are looking forward to... seeing your humorous side. However, you said during the phone interview... that you wanted to be cautious because you are afraid. It's better to be safe than sorry. As I was leaving home today, my mother said... "Be careful with what you say." She said this to me 10 times. Are you opinionated? - I am when I am home alone. - What about with your friends? I don't express my opinions much when I am with my friends. - I see. - I try to make them laugh. - You should try to make us laugh. - Don't be afraid. - Make us laugh today. - Yes, please. - Okay. - Yes. You aren't tired, are you? I suffer from chronic fatigue. (He answers Jong Shin's questions with ease.) Why are you laughing so much? Everything that comes out of Dong Hwi's mouth is funny. (Dong Hwi is a peculiar man.) Dong Hwi, you said earlier that you are a big fan of Radio Star. You mentioned that you were moved by Gook Jin trying to blow out... - the candles with a bat. - I watched that part so many times. - You watched it 1,000 times. - Why would he do that? - Did he blow out the candles? - Did I read the script wrong? He broke the candles. - Why does he like it so much? - That was funny. I still found it funny even after I had seen it so many times. Is that so? You are not playing baseball. Swing it like this. I have blown out candles like this before. Gook Jin. I can do it. Here I go. I don't want to get hit by a bat. (Surprised) What have you done? (It's a great scene.) Do you really watch Radio Star that often? I watched the show religiously... even when there were different hosts. There are a lot of screenshots of the previous host on the internet. - That's right. - There are a lot of screenshots. There are no screenshots of Kyu Hyun. There are a lot of screenshots of the previous host and myself. There are no screenshots of Kyu Hyun. No one is interested in Kyu Hyun. There is nothing on him. The previous one is more popular. - Kyu Hyun is... - Are you done? Yes. Kyu Hyun is an essential part of Radio Star. - That's right. - That's how I see it. I can why Dong Hwi is one of the most popular actors right now. (You're an outstanding judge of character.) It was easy to invite the other guests thanks to Seol Hyun. Upon hearing that Seol Hyun would be on the show, these three men agreed to come on the show. Is this your first time meeting her? - Yes. - Yes. - This is my first time meeting her. - Seol Hyun? - We go to the same hair salon. - That's right. - I see. - They met at the hair salon. What's it like to see Seol Hyun at the hair salon? She looked different without her makeup. I heard that... Min and Dong Hwi continued to delay their visit to the show... and only agreed to come on when they heard Seol Hyun was coming. - Dong Hwi, is that true? - Min doesn't seem to agree. - That wasn't the case for me. - Dong Hwi, is that what you did? I have worked with Min before. - Seol Hyun... - Why did you decide on this week? It was fate. - It was just meant to be. - It was fate? - The universe chose the date. - So you visited the show... - with Seol Hyun by coincidence. - That's right. You knew Seol Hyun would be here, right? - Yes, I knew. - How did that make you feel? The people around me were really happy. - It's true. - Okay. I was happy but the people around me... - were even more excited. - She is very popular. People want to see her in person. Kim Hyeong Ja is a big fan of Seol Hyun, too. - They belong to the same clan. - Really? I responded without realising that it was a joke. - I am so annoyed with myself. - Jung Soo, you are very gullible. I know. I might pay for someone else's debts again. I might do it again. (He is gullible.) Seol Hyun was the most searched name on search engines in 2015. I heard that you still get surprised when you read a nice comment. I imagine there wouldn't be many malicious comments about you. The thing is, I am interested in what other people say about me. So I look myself up on search engines... - all the time. - Don't do that. - There are many malicious comments. - Don't do it. - Don't read the comments. - The nice comments... - make me happy. - What do the mean comments say? - People are just jealous. - Well... - That's the reason. - They don't bother me anymore. If you truly don't mind... - Let her talk. - Stop butting in. - You are so noisy. - Stop talking. - You are so loud. - I am an expert on these matters. If you truly don't mind, you should stop reading them. - Don't read the comments. - Let Seol Hyun speak. They bother me but the words don't hurt me anymore. - You have become stronger. - "The words don't hurt me anymore." It sounds like something Kim Sang Hyuk would say. Her condition... is referred to as "Burnout" in psychiatric circles. She has let go of everything. Excuse me. You are wrong. Stop seeing the worst in everything. That's not what burnout is. Burnout is characterised by exhaustion. You are wrong. Gu Ra. Stop using that tone with me. Your jokes are outdated. (Laughing) - You are nervous, aren't you? - What? - Are you nervous? - I have visited Radio Star before. Most of my parts were edited out. I was asked to visit the show again with Park Na Rae so I refused. You made the right call. I watched that episode. I would have been edited out again. I have nothing to do with those comedians. It's not like you have anything to do with these guests, either. We're all shooting a lot of commercials. - It's the same industry. - I see. They have all shot a lot of commercials. How many commercials did you shoot? I shot four commercials in a month. One of the commercials was for a financial institution. But you have declared bankruptcy in the past. - How did you get the offer? - It's a miracle. - He's right. - This is a miracle. (It's all thanks to me.) Min did his first job with me. - How did that happen? - It was a sitcom. - We were in a sitcom together. - It was an SBS sitcom. (The sitcom they starred in aired from 2002 to 2003.) What did you want to tell me? Why are you hesitating? I don't think the three of us should meet today. - What was Min like back then? - Tell us. - What was he like? - He was very nice. He was very nice. He said, "Thank you, Jung Soo. Thank you for the advice." He gave me his phone number, but I never called him. Back then, I only hung out with successful people. (Joking) The character, Nam Kyu Man broke 10,000 dollars worth of equipment. - That's right. - He broke a car, a golf club, six laptop computers, seven crystal cups and a nameplate. I didn't know he broke a car in the drama. Was it an expensive car? An inexperienced driver was driving a small car in the drama. That car cut in front of Kyu Man's car and at the time... he was in a foul mood, so he took out a golf club. - Did you really break the car? - Yes. (This is the scene.) The matter has been taken care of. (Golf club) (Terrifying) Hey, lady. Did you think I would let it slide because you're a novice driver? You shouldn't have driven so carelessly. You are so annoying! (He throws the golf club away.) Nam Kyu Man is a very bad man. - He is downright evil. - He really is. - He is bad. - He really is a bad man. I am guessing he threw the laptop. - As for the laptop, - Maybe he punched the laptop. - the character was using it. - Maybe he was typing furiously... when he got upset and ripped off the keypads. He breaks it by stomping on it. - Dong Hwi likes Gook Jin's jokes. - It's not that. - It wasn't funny. - I was laughing... at the expression you were making as you watched Gook Jin's skit. This is what you looked like. Why are you focusing on things like that? (Displeased) (They're looking exactly the same.) (He's an excellent observer.) Min, you played the villain in this drama. I heard you've developed... anger management issues like your character. Once when I parked my car in the car park, the security guard told me that... - I couldn't park there. - Okay. - Normally, I would apologise and... - That's right. move my car. But this happened right after... a scene where I lose my temper and I was so immersed in it. Without realising it, I said... "What is he saying?" After that I just walked away. - Really? - What did he say? He just went back inside. That's when I realised... I shouldn't always apologise... - all the time. - What? I realised people look down on me because I always... apologise first. - Being aggressive worked for you. - He just... went back to his office. I thought to myself, "Should I keep doing this?" Maybe he watched your show. I know why it's so quiet. My story wasn't funny. - It was funny. - It was a good story. - It's not that. - Not at all. - Your story was good. - Why are you trying to ruin it? - Don't say that. It was funny. - I just... - I watch your show a lot, so... - No. - I know how you're feeling. - No. Your story was really funny. - Should I say more? - No. You shouldn't. - Shall I? - You're going to ruin the story. - Don't do it. - I had an incident in the car park. - Is it a really funny story? - What happened? - I was passing by... - Is it a funny story? I got into my car and I was about to leave. I was about to leave when... a guy in his 50s approached me and said... "Gu Ra, hold on. Let me take a picture." I said yes, but... I thought he would come over and stand next to me for the photo. I was standing like this when he said, "Just one second!" And he took a photo of me. He said thank you and just left. (The fan just left.) - Is that it? - Yes. Wasn't it funny? This one wasn't that funny. - I don't think they'll cut it. - Min, yours was funny. - Gu Ra's story was okay. - It was funny. (He's a funny guy.) Min, you believe that your acting is better when your manager... drives you the wrong way to the shooting location. It's because I had a really hard time trying to... - immerse myself in this role. - I see. But whenever my manager drives the wrong way or... makes a mistake, I arrive at the set feeling angry. So my acting is better. - It's not a superstition. - Your manager is a great guy. (His manager tried to help him improve his acting.) My manager makes mistakes and it's hard for me to decide... whether I should get angry or not. I had to get to Han river park. - The shoot was under the bridge. - Okay. He parked on the bridge and said, "The map says we're here." "How do we go down there?" - The map confused him. - The map said we were there. - He's funny. - It felt like... he did it on purpose. - I thought he was joking. - His manager is funny. My manager is quite big and he was on a diet. So I had to eat by myself. I was a little irritated with him because he wouldn't eat with me. But he uses my credit card. One day, around midnight... (They're curious.) I received a text message for a McDonald's receipt. (You spent 16 dollars and 80 cents at McDonalds.) I asked him if he was with a friend. He said he was alone. - He had a party at McDonalds. - It's fine. Let him eat. - Talking about managers is fun. - It is. For me, I hate it when someone... doesn't turn off the lights. One day, I came out to the living room. It was summer but it was so cold. I wondered why. I felt a cold wind coming from somewhere. I was looking around and I opened my manager's room. I thought I was in the movie "Frozen". My manager went out in the morning. - He left the air conditioner on. - He didn't turn it off. That's not funny at all. What was that? It wasn't funny at all. Please cut this part out. (Kyu Hyun's story ruined the fun.) (He's sorry his story wasn't funny.) Dong Hwi, you don't seem like the type to lose your temper. - I had many funny moments. - Yes. My former manager now works for Yu Hae Jin. - He used to work with me. - You mean Yu Hae Jin? Yes. We're in the same company. When he first started working, I asked him to bring me the storyboard. "It's me, can you bring me the storyboard?" He said, "Do you mean the duck tape?" - Duck tape? - I couldn't understand him. - Duck tape? - I thought, "Why would someone need duck tape in the morning?" I was about to go act, so why would I need duck tape? I couldn't understand him. One day, our company's promoting team asked him to... tell them about my role in the show... so they could publish an article about me. He said, "Is Dong Hwi getting soaked in the rain?" (Do you have hearing problems?) - This happened all the time. - I see. - I see. - Yes, so... - I was worried about Hae Jin. - Okay. Hae Jin also had a hard time communicating with him. He would say, "Buy me three rolls of kimbap. Three rolls." - He repeats everything twice. - "Don't buy 30 rolls of kimbap." I could already predict what would happen next. He bought 30 rolls of kimbap. He bought 30 rolls of kimbap? But he told him three rolls. (I should just have a kimbap party.) (He makes it fun again.) - May I tell you one more story? - No, you may not. - Stop it. We have a lot to do. - Hold on. - Please give me a chance. - Why are you insisting on this? - Give me a chance. - We have a lot to do here. - His manager works really hard. - Please let me tell you. - It won't be funny. - Let me tell you one story. Let's hear him out. If it's not funny, you have to apologise. - Yes, I will apologise if it's not. - All right. - I just remembered this. - Is it the same manager? No. He's not my manager anymore. He was driving and... he made an illegal U-turn. A police car followed him. Suddenly, he started speeding on the opposite lane. He kept driving and crossed a bridge. Finally, the police car caught us. Then he turned and said, "Kyu Hyun, can you switch seats with me?" He asked me to switch seats with him. You should've told this story earlier. This is funny. I thought, "Isn't the manager..." "meant to be protecting me?" If I switch, I'd become a person who made an illegal U-turn and... - I might be on the newspaper. - That's right. I didn't know why he was asking me to do such thing. The police officer got so angry. He handcuffed my manager and was about to arrest him. He turned and said, "Kyu Hyun, if I get arrested, what happens to you?" He started to care about me... right after he got handcuffed. He said, "You can't do anything without me. Kyu Hyun." He was dragged away. You should have told this story first! - The first story was not funny. - I was left alone in the car. - I didn't know what to do. - This was funny. - He called out my name. - It was funny. It's fun to talk about managers. - We should make it a segment. - We should. (We're waiting for stories about your managers.) Dong Hwi, I heard you had a feeling that you got the part... when you auditioned for "Reply 1988". We should talk about the tarot card reading episode. - You're talking about that. - Yes, we are. I usually go get my fortune told when the new year begins. It was a few months before I auditioned for "Reply 1988". This episode happened in January. The cards said, "This year is going to be all about reply." - Wow. - The tarot cards said that? I didn't think it was going to be about "Reply 1988". I just thought I'd be rewarded because I've been working hard. - That's what I thought. - This is fascinating. I suddenly remembered the reading after the audition. Your ad-lib lines are famous. What were they? I don't mean to improvise but... - I have such a bad memory. - Okay. - It's hard to memorise the lines. - I see. But that doesn't give me an excuse to make mistakes. So even if I can't remember a line, I can't just say, "Sorry. I forgot." I couldn't do that. So the lines that I said to avoid those situations became... - famous for some reason. - People liked it. - It's interesting. - What are the lines? "Deok Seon, where are you? Can you hear me?" - It's not something special. - But it's funny. I need to look for her while saying it. "Deok Seon, where are you? Can you hear... Where are you?" (Inside a bus full of people) Where are we? Are we there yet? Should I get off now? We are not there yet. I wouldn't leave you on the bus. Deok Seon, where are you? Can you hear me? Answer me, Deok Seon. - "Where are you?" - He's a great actor. - "Where are you?" - In the movie, "The Beauty Inside", you make your lines sound like ad-libs. - Yes. - Is it like what Kim Soo Ro does? - No, they're different. - He has his own style. - Is he like Lim Hyeon Sik, then? - No, that's not it. - Is he like Park Chul Min, then? - Just watch his films. (Just watch his films.) (What a cutting remark!) Seol Hyun, you stood in front of many telecommunication stores. She's the best. - I heard people steal the cutouts. - They do? - They sell it for 100 dollars each. - Wow. (Her life-size cutout is worth 120 dollars.) - Did you know about this? - They were only worth 30 dollars. - Did it start from 30 dollars? - Yes. - It went up a lot. - You've been checking the price. - Yes, I have. - She is like Gu Ra. (She's the female version of Gu Ra.) Do you like your pose on the cutout? I didn't intend to pose that way. They told me that it will be placed in front of the stores. They asked me to pose as if I'm inviting people in. So that's what I did. People don't come in and steal the cutouts instead. Seol Hyun is famous for her cute gestures. We heard you can do them anytime. I'm not really the cute type. - I don't have a high-pitched voice. - Right. My fans were disappointed, so... I do it to cheer up... - my fans. - Right. - How do you do it? - Could you show us? I pronounce my name differently to act cute. - I see. - I see. Please show us. - Should I look at the camera? - Yes. Is Theol Hyun cute? (She makes their hearts flutter.) My heart is beating too fast. - It's beating too fast. - You mean it's bad? - You mean it's bad? - No, I don't mean it that way. No, but it's lethal. You can also do that with other people's names, right? Like Dung Soo, right? - Dung Soo? - Did you say dung? (Hello, I'm Dung Soo.) Dung Soo? I think Seol Hyun's fan base is quite broad. I was on soap operas and... weekend dramas. Which show were you on? "Seoyoung, My Daughter" and "Ugly Alert". - You were on "Ugly Alert"? - Yes. That was my first show before AOA became popular. I think that's why my fan base is broad. - That's right. - Old people adore her, too. You should star in a movie, too. I've been shooting one recently. Who plays the lead? - Seol Gyeong Gu and Kim Nam Gil. - Oh, I see. He is Theol Gyeong Gu. (Theol Gyeong Gu) Jung Soo, what do people say to you the most these days? "Hurry up and marry Kim Sook." I reply, "All right." I used to say, "Why should I marry her?" "I have an ideal type, too." "It's just a TV show." "Should couples on TV shows all get married?" But I realised that viewers could... become disappointed if I said that. What do you hate hearing the most? "Hurry up and marry Kim Sook." I heard your ratings have gone down a bit. - Yes, but I don't care. - Yes. - Your ratings have gone down. - He's obsessed with ratings. - He's sensitive about the ratings. - Exactly. - He knows when it drops. - You should keep telling people... you don't want to marry her. Then people will continue to... believe it's real and watch it. You need to keep hating Sook. (You should hate her more.) I heard there were times when your heart fluttered because of her. - Really? - Sometimes... she says, "Jung Soo, Jung Soo." "I want to take you somewhere." "Just get in the car." Then she touches me a little. It feels weird. - When she touches you? - Yes, it makes me wonder... whether she thinks of me as more than just a friend. - Sometimes it feels that way. - Jung soo... Is money that important to you? - She works a lot. - Let me ask the three of you. Do you want them to become a real couple? What do you think, Dong Hwi? I want you to be happy no matter what you decide. Happiness is the most important thing. Dong Hwi is really popular these days. He's shot 11 commercials since he starred in "Reply 1988". Both Jung Soo and you shot a commercial for a finance company. - Is that so? - Which commercial were you in? - K investment and securities. - I see. I'm in the commercial for H investment and securities. Let's have a fair game. - Advertisers will love that. - Let's have a fair game. Advertisers will love that. - The market is bad these days. - That's right. - We should all do well. - Yes, you should. Think of it as your own money. Seol Hyun is competing with Sook and Jung Soo for... shopping mall commercials. - Which shopping mall? - Is it S shopping mall? - No, it's G shopping mall. - Yes, that's right. - How about you, Jung Soo? - Oh, well... - I'm the face of 11 shopping mall. - All right. - Let's sell quality products. - Okay. (Min looks gloomy.) - How about you, Min? - To be honest... Jung Soo has shot more commercials than me. I've only shot one. - I see. - Which one? Well, it's not... Why are you sighing? - The advertisers... - Yes. saw my character doing drugs on the show. - They remember the scene. - There's nothing you can do. I also smashed a car in the drama. I heard I almost got a car commercial. The next day, I smashed a car with a golf club in the drama. - So you didn't get the commercial? - No, I didn't. (That was my car commercial.) Min is such a great son. I heard he bought a... - surprise gift for his father. - Really? - Yes. - What did you get him? Last year, I bought him an... - expensive car. - Really? - Was it a surprise gift? - Yes. I invited him to dinner in Gangnam. During dinner, he kept asking for alcohol. - He shouldn't drink, right? - He needs to drive the gift. - So, I tried to stop him. - He needs to drive the car. He got upset and said... "You invited me to dinner and I wanted to have a few drinks." "Why won't you let me have a few drinks?" - I stopped him. - You stopped him from drinking. I had prepared the car for him downstairs. I put a ribbon around it and had the windows tinted. I also installed a black box. I had everything ready. - Wow. That sounds amazing. - That would be a surprise. I asked him if he likes it. He said he did. I told him that it was his. He knows how to give a surprise gift. My father is really a humble man, but... after I gave him the car he started acting a little differently. - Did he start spending more money? - Yes. He started asking for more money. I thought to myself, "Maybe I shouldn't have bought him a car." (He's only joking.) I know this because I bought things for my parents, too. He will ask you to buy him sunglasses soon. Dong Hwi, is Big Bang's T.O.P like a mentor to you? Yes. He gives me great advice. I'd really want to thank him. When I shot "Tazza: The Hidden Card", I didn't have an agency. So he always gave me a ride. He always picked me up. - That's when you became close. - Yes. I was really grateful. - I heard you also shared a room. - Yes, when we were shooting, - he shared his room with me. - I see. He said his room was big enough for two people. - But... - But they gave me a big room, too. When I went to his room, I had to sleep on the couch. It was pretty uncomfortable. (They're close friends.) I can tell T.O.P is a great guy. The reason why I say that he's my mentor is because... he imitated the character in the movie, "Whiplash". "That was great!" He would encourage me. - He did it to cheer you up. - Yes. He'd say, "Dong Hwi, that was great!" or "That wasn't good." I hear that the Big Bang members are kind... and generous to everyone. I've heard many moving stories about them. - I met him yesterday. - Yes. He asked me to say this to Gu Ra. - He likes you a lot. - T.O.P said that? Gu Ra is a real hip-hop artist. - He asked me to tell you this. - I remember when he was on... the show, "Nothing is Impossible". He had just made his debut. We were eating ice cream at Je Dong's house. One of his teeth fell out... and he went home. (This was T.O.P 10 years ago.) - Have one. - Please have one. It's okay. Try one. (He happily picks an ice cream.) (He takes a bite.) (At that moment) An unexpected incident happened. T.O.P's tooth fell out while eating an ice cream. (His tooth fell out.) (He had to go to the dentist.) I still remember that. He likes you! Why are you telling us that? This is hip-hop. I don't care what people say about me. I'm going to do it my way. - Is that your swag? - Yes. (Jun Ha, let's have a rap battle.) That's hip-hop. - It must have been so hard. - The ice cream he had was BBBig. - I get why his tooth fell out. - That ice cream is hard as a rock. - They use red beans. - That's right. - It's so hard inside. - It's hard to bite. - We could use it as a hammer - Right. (My tooth fell out!) Seol Hyun, it's been five years since you debuted. But it's only been a year since you bought your mobile phone. I hadn't owned a mobile phone since I was a trainee. I didn't have one even when... we came in first place with "Miniskirt" and "Like a Cat". After we won, I thought the time was right to get a phone. - So I asked the director. - I see. I heard that the idols singers are not... allowed to have mobile phones these days. So they use... tablet PCs to contact people. - They use the Wi-Fi connection. - Yes, they use the Wi-Fi. We used to write e-mails. We missed our parents so badly. - Through a computer? - Yes. - We sent e-mails to our family. - That sounds bad. Where do your parents live? They live in Bucheon. - I'm from Bucheon. - Where in Bucheon? I know the area. Where in Bucheon? - It's Jak-dong. - Jak-dong! There are many restaurants that sell ducks, right? - That's right. - I see. (He's found something they have in common.) Do you change your phone number twice a month, Seol Hyun? I get many phone calls from unknown numbers and... I see many unfamiliar faces on my messenger. But even if I change my number, it keeps happening. - I once changed my phone number. - Yes. I got a text message right after I changed it. It said... "Kyu Hyun, you changed your number." You should be grateful for the extra attention. (You should be thankful!) Is there a rule on who you give your number to? I don't have many friends, so... - if they ask, I give it to them. - Right. Do you have Park Myung Soo's number? I had it before but I changed my phone and... - Right. - You didn't delete it, did you? No, I didn't delete his number. It's good that you did that. Myung Soo will ask you to sing in one of his songs soon. (HW will ask you to sing in his song.) You'd have to sing in an EDM song. Jung Soo, when Sook visited Radio Star, - Gu Ra told her that... - Yes. you used to play the tambourine in a karaoke bar. You do know how he became a comedian, right? - I don't know. - He used to work in a karaoke bar. (He played the tambourine in a karaoke bar.) - Yes. - Did you think it was unfair? You should've said that I was a student who had a part-time job... as a waiter in a karaoke bar. I didn't play the tambourine. Also, the income difference... between a waiter and a DJ was pretty big. We received 1,000 dollars a month and they got 3,000 dollars. They liked how funny I was, so they promoted me. I fell in love with money and quit college after six months. Bring the tambourine. Show us what you used to do. - It's... - You must be amazing. Do you play it like Kim Hyeo Nuk? - He is... - How does he play it? - He's flashy. - He does it like Latin dance moves. - Let's hear him sing later. - He tosses it up, too. There he goes. (He tosses the tambourine.) (Applauding) - What's your style? - Show us. - How do you do it? - Did he do this? That's just fooling around. We went... (Full-body massage) (It feels like the 90s karaoke.) Hey, bring us some beers. (We'll give you three beers for free.) - Let's sing! - That's great. You're like a cheerleader. Seol Hyun prepared something since it's her first appearance. - No one has seen what she can do. - This is a first. - I have high hopes. - I can make the kettle sound. - The water boiling sound? - That's hard. (Beeping) (She's an enchanted kettle.) Wasn't that a dolphin? - Kettles make that noise. - That's right. - They do. - Yes. - They make that noise. - Sorry. - That noise... - That was great. - We like it because it's Seol Hyun. - Do something else. - Do something else. - Yes. - Can you impersonate Ok Hee? - Okay. I'll imitate Ok Hee, one of Kim Tae Gyun's characters. Mister. (How will Seol Hyun impersonate him?) (Warming up) Mister, mister. (He's laughing a lot today.) - She just came up with that. - It's a bit like the kettle. Can you mimic Christina? - Yes. - Who is Christina? Hello, everyone. I'm Christina from Italy. - "I will kill you." - She says, "I'm Cristina." - "I'm from Italy." - "Step on it." - "What are you doing?" - "In Italy..." You ruined it for Seol Hyun. - "I will kill you." - She'll do much better than us. - "See you." - Go for it. - Just go for it. - Okay. Well... Hello, I'm Christina. I'm good at making hobakjeon. - I liked that very much. - She did pretty well. - Well done. - That was good. All of us were thinking, "I wish she does well." (Seol Hyun's followers pray with fervour.) (The goddess brought them laughter.) While talking to a writer, Dong Hwi said he'd show us something. I'll stay on the trend and imitate someone else. - He'll do another impression. - Okay. Let's continue with the impressions. There's a band called Y2K. - Y2K? - That's different. - They sang out of tune on a show. - Oh, that. (I'm sorry, I'm hiding in...) Sorry. (I'm sorry, I'm hiding in... Sorry.) That's what happened. (Another round of laughter) - He apologised right away. - He did. That's the ideal manner of apologising. Seol Hyun will show off her dance moves as well. - Really? - Dance? - Go on, then. - Seol Hyun. - Go, Seol Hyun! - Seol Hyun... She's from Bucheon. (Looks that would make any man fall in love.) (His limbs are too short.) (Her alluring gestures are captivating.) (One move makes your heart drop.) She's good. (Even Gu Ra is amazed by Seol Hyun.) (She does a body roll leaning on the table.) (He doesn't dare to look, but he claps.) Dong Hwi. He was clapping before he knew it. She has a beautiful figure. (She turns elegantly.) - She's great. - Is this club music? - She moves gracefully. - I'd like to watch this... - for an hour. - Me, too. She's so pretty. (She ends with her signature pose.) It's over already. That was amazing. I almost took off my cast. - Why? - To dance with her. Were you healed? - Were you? - Yes. - I was healed by Seol Hyun. - Really? - I almost got up. - She's just... (She works miracles.) Dong Hwi, you clapped during her performance. Yes. I found myself clapping before I even knew it. (Was he healed by her as well?) How about we make him dance? - Are you game? - Dong Hwi. Let's see how he does after Seol Hyun. Dong Hwi, just... - It's an old song. - My goodness. That's from the early 90s. (He starts moving his shoulders.) - He's good. - I'm liking this. He's good. Why does he remind me of Tak Jae Hoon? - You're right. - He's like Tak Jae Hoon. - That's right. - Please show us again. - Stand over here. - He dances like Jae Hoon. - He moves like Jae Hoon. - Exactly. - Yes, that's it. - Look at him. (Tak Jae Hoon's shoulder dance) (Let's compare his dance with Jae Hoon's.) Look. That's how Jae Hoon dances. Do you see it? He dances like Jae Hoon. That's how Jae Hoon dances when he sings. (Dong Hwi found his true identity.) Namkoong Min, can you dance to Justin Bieber's songs? - Can you dance? - No, that was... - Justin Bieber? - It was for "We Got Married". - I forgot the moves. - I heard you were good. I don't remember anything. A round of applause should help with his memory. Give it a go. - I can't remember the dance. - That's fine. Just be yourself. (He raises an arm, but then goes back to clapping.) You look like some guy from the neighbourhood. (He dances like a middle-aged man.) (It looks like he's exercising around a mineral spring.) I like this. (He wraps it up with his badminton move.) Look at that. You're oozing charm. (The naive guy did his best.) I did my best. I really can't dance. - He raised his arms. - You really can't dance. Min, you debuted as a film director. Yes. This was more like a dream of mine. I'd always wanted to direct a film ever since I was young. Watching films was a huge stress-reliever for me, and I think I was the happiest when I was watching a film. What's it called? - "Light My Fire". - "Light My Fire". Isn't it Jim Morrison's song? - That's right. - Is it from a song? Did directing make you realise acting is a piece of cake? (He's flustered.) Directors have more things to worry about. I didn't say that to mean that acting is a menial job. I just realised how hard it is to direct something. There are so many details to sort through. How much did you spend? Well... I paid for everything, you see. - Did you? - Did you spend 100,000 dollars? - I didn't spend that much. - Not that much? - It's a short film. - Isn't it too little? - A short film? - It runs for about 22 minutes. How much did you spend on it? - How much? - Yes. The production cost. - How much did you spend? - Do I have to... About 40,000 dollars including post-production cost. I see. Did you have to get that out of him? - Yes. - We make people tell us. - Transparency's the best policy. - I see. Did you submit it anywhere? - The Cannes Film Festival. - I see. My film will compete for Short Films. Dong Hwi did so well. How much did you pay the actors? It'd be almost nothing if he spent 40,000 dollars. I paid him the most out of all the actors. How much? We need the exact number. - How much? - I gave him 500 dollars. How much do you usually get for being in a short film? - It's too little. - I once got just 20 dollars. 500 dollars is a huge amount. I was in the much talked about "Rice Cake Piercer". - I appeared for free. - Who talked about it? - It was talked by a lot of people. - Who? It was mentioned all over the internet. - It didn't do as well as I thought. - "Rice Cake Piercer"? That's the director's fault. Not mine. - Are you blaming him? - Actors are nothing. (Actors are nothing!) Dong Hwi said he agreed to be in Min's film because of... the shooting schedule. Yes, it was a short project. - How short? Two days? - Yes. - I saw him in "A Dirty Carnival". - Right. His acting had left... a lasting impression on me. I was very honoured that he asked me to be in his first film. What I thought was funny was on the first day of the shoot, he showed up wearing a shirt and nice trousers. Most film directors focus on what they're filming, so they don't care what they're wearing. - They dress for comfort. - I thought, "Oh, he must be in the film." He even hired a photographer. Was there a red carpet? (I feel so thirsty.) The photographer took photos of him directing us. - What was it for? - That's funny. The photographer... wasn't there to take pictures of me. - He took photos of the set. - Behind-the-scene still shots? He was so well-dressed when we started the shoot, but when it got to the end, he didn't look nice at all. His clothes were dirty. - He worked hard. - Yes, his passion... - Until then... - You're messing with me. The butt area was very dirty. - It was a first and I was nervous. - Right. I dressed up the way I did because... I didn't want people to think less of me. - So you thought about it. - Right. I thought I'd pulled it off, but obviously I hadn't. Towards the end, his unbuttoned shirt and... - dirty trousers... - I set it all up. Forget it. (Dong Hwi's hilarious.) Min, how did you find Dong Hwi's acting? He's a great actor. Actually, I'm an actor who became a director, so I like to give the actors free rein... and let them do what they want. I'd tell them, "It's okay to mess up the lines." "You don't have to act the same way for every take." That's what I said. He worried too little. When it came to the editing stage, - Were you not able to edit? - the scenes didn't go together. - Oh dear. - This film... is all about Dong Hwi's individuality. (We'll get to see his acting spectrum.) He's a great actor, - but if we do three takes, - Are they all different? they're all different. - I don't do it on purpose. - It happens. - I have a terrible memory. - I thought that... his different takes look and feel more natural, - and that I could edit it later on. - But you couldn't. I've decided not to give the actors too much freedom. (No more freedom for you!) - Not any more. - No. Dong Hwi, why were you concerned about... the way Min directed his film? - Did his style worry you? - No, no. - Spill it now. - It's an industry-wide problem. It's a widespread problem. So much happened in just two days. (Are they gearing up to fight it out?) - What happened? - He trusted us and gave us... so much freedom that I felt the pressure. Did you want to film extra scenes? I wanted to... Yes, I wanted to film a bit more. I saw you almost put your tongue in your cheek. Did I see correctly? I wanted to... (He sighs then his cheek bulged.) Yes, I wanted to film a bit more. (Dong Hwi is knocked out.) - You submitted your film to Cannes. - Yes. - Do you think you'll win? - You could... No, I don't. - The likelihood of winning... - Because of the editing? - No, I... - They might consider that artistic. It all depends. Give the judges more credit. (Give the judges more credit.) If you watch it, you'll realise that... it's a high-quality film. It doesn't look like a low-budget one. - It looks like we spent a fortune. - It came out nicely. Whether it's a great film or not, I hope that... a lot of people watch it when it's released. I want people to criticise... or tell me what they liked about it. I want feedback. - We'll see how it does. - Okay. You met your current girlfriend while filming this movie. - You went public. - Yes. Is she a model? Yes. - Is she in your film? - You asked that so casually. - Why not? - Do you prefer discomfort? (Do you prefer discomfort?) - Is she in the film? - Yes. That's why you dressed up that day. (That's why you dressed up.) - You didn't like her then. - It was just business. He's always well-dressed. (Dong Hwi chimes in.) Did you already have an eye on her? I had to cast someone who'd stand out, so we called about five models... and had them audition for the role. All the other members of the crew... said they wanted someone else for the role, but I thought that she suited the character better. So I thought hard about... whether I should go with the majority or my choice. As the director, I wanted to make the call and take responsibility, so I cast her. - It was a girlfriend audition. - That's lovely. (A girlfriend audition) Is this your first going public with your relationship? Yes, it is. How did you feel when the media reported it? A reporter called up my girlfriend... and pretended to be my friend. - Really? - He asked questions. He asked her questions like a nosy friend would, - and caught her off-guard. - She fell for it. She said, "How did you know we're dating?" It was all over the news that day. (It went straight to press.) - You didn't intend it, then. - No. My girlfriend was very flustered. - She would be. - She didn't know what to do. I said, "It's okay, give it time." "Don't worry, just wait." - She didn't know what to do. - I'm not surprised. Because our agencies could release conflicting opinions, - I decided to go public. - That's not a bad thing. - Do you feel better now? - I feel so much better. No wonder. That's why earlier on today... - Hong Jin Young? - She just left. (He laughs awkwardly.) Hong Jin Young just left. - She was here. - Did you have to mention her? People who like to gossip string things together like this. (Gossipers string things together.) Your girlfriend is 11 years younger... and she is a model, so what did you like about her? The answer to that would be the reason... I started dating her. As soon as I finished shooting the film, I flew to China to film another one for two months. Because I wasn't in Korea, we talked on the phone a lot, and she was very mature and calm. That's what I liked about her. How did you ask her out? - Actually... - Your project was very short. - Nothing happened on set. - Right. I found out that one of my friends teaches acting to... aspiring actors in her agency. - It's Yang Zu Ho. - Yes. He played the matchmaker, and arranged for us to eat dinner together, - and exchange numbers. - Did you ask him to? Did you tell him to? - I don't think so. - He's very quick-witted. - He's friendly... - Zu Ho? - He's quick to notice things. - He noticed your interest. Even before I brought it up, he said, "Min, I'm teaching Ah Reum today." - "Are you free for dinner?" - What a great friend. Of course I said I'd like that. - He noticed it first. - He did. What's his name? - Zu Ho. - Yang Zu Ho. Yang Zu Ho? You'll get a call from me soon. (I'm coming for you.) - Are you looking for a matchmaker? - To act like a bridge. (A bridge) (Sook won't be pleased.) Min, for your girlfriend's birthday, you set up a surprise event. - An event? - What did you do? - You bought your father a car. - I just... - bought her a cake... - I see. - and a small gift. - How about this for an idea? - It's a Nam Kyu Man event. - Okay. Wrap your gift in plaster. Then smash it for her. (He's channelling the evil man, Nam Kyu Man.) - How about that? - Is there a jewel inside? It's a Nam Kyu Man event. Is it Nam or Cho? Don't get confused. - He knows too much. - Cho Kyu Man's a singer. Mix the two together, then. - Sing "I'll Give You Everything". - I will give you everything (It's a thriller-romance.) Seol Hyun, your ideal type hasn't changed since your debut. It's Song Joong Ki, the hottest man on the planet. I think the two of you could end up dating. - When were you born? - In 1995. - Joong Ki was born in... - 1985. You could become a couple. Suzy and Lee Min Ho dated. - You just have to work together. - That's right. I would love to work with him. - He's my ideal type, so... - In reality, - have you seen him in person? - We never crossed paths. I'd love to work with him. - Do you watch his current drama? - Yes. I'm a fan of "Descendants of the Sun". You never end up dating your ideal type, right? That's when one is way too good for the other. I apologise in advance, but if Park Na Rae says... her ideal type is Zo In Sung, they don't stand a chance. But do you think it's possible for them to date? - It's possible. - Not if they go public about it. - What if... - What do you say, Min? - Why are you asking me? - What do you think, Dong Hwi? I just want everyone to be happy. (I want everyone to be happy.) (He wants to spread happiness.) Seol Hyun, do you go to the toilet at a designated time? I had to keep a detailed journal when I was a trainee. We wrote a schedule and had to stick to it. I thought it was a waste of time to go to the toilet. Each morning, I wrote out my schedule for the day, and I could only fall asleep once I'd completed everything. - What if you feel the urge to go? - You don't have a choice, then. It couldn't be helped, so then I practised that much longer... - to make up for it. - You didn't waste any time. You're meticulous. No wonder she succeeded. - She's a bit like Seo Hyun. - Yes, she is. I think you'd get along well with Kang Ha Neul. He's nerdy like you. - He's a great guy. - He's famous for being kind. He's a nice guy. - Is Joong Ki the one for you? - Yes. Okay. (Thanks for that.) (She's sweet and honest.) - Jung Soo, you set fire to... - Yes? a petrol station while looking at a woman. - Sorry, you almost did. - Would he be here if he did? I was filling my car's petrol tank one day, and a woman came up claiming to be my fan and she was beautiful. I wanted to ask for her number, but that's too forward. The woman said, "I hope to see you again." I thought that was my cue. I yelled, "Just a moment!" Then she said, "What?" I said, "Park over there." That took a lot of courage. She slowed down and parked near the exit of the petrol station. I drove up to her, but I'd forgotten about the pump. (The pump was in his car.) I just drove straight on. I heard a thump and saw what looked like a fountain of oil. The machine had fallen over, and oil was spurting from the underground tank. - Really? - That was close. I helped the staff secure the tank, put the machine in place. I made all the other drivers wait, paid 2,000 dollars in damages and lost the woman. - She was a gold digger. - Why would she be a gold digger? - She's not a gold digger. - She's not. I'm just saying it out of anger. She just said she was your fan and pulled up her car. That's all. She should have waited for me. She's not a gold digger. She's gold. (He's lived such an eventful life.) Dong Hwi, you debuted kind of late. You debuted in 2013. It's been four years. You said it's because... you were in university for seven years. That's right. My father wondered if I was a medical student. A medical student? (His father must be witty.) You majored in acting. If you were going to be an actor anyway, why didn't you debut earlier? It's not that I wanted to wait, but I felt I wasn't ready. I thought I wasn't good enough. You stayed as a student for such a long time. Weren't your parents worried? They were very concerned. I didn't even have many conversations with them. When I was at home, my father wouldn't even turn on the television. He would just sit there twisting his hair. And then he would call me. "So what's your plan?" "I'll figure it out." - You said that? - Then... he would ask me the exact same question two days later. "So what's your plan?" "As I said two days ago, I'll figure it out." He would repeat it over and over again. I realised it's impossible to have a meaningful conversation with him. I guess he wanted to pressure you. Probably. But once, I understood why he was so worried. There was this game I loved to play. One day, I was completely immersed in the game. It was a critical moment. My comrades and I were in the final stage. We were a team. If we had died there, we would have lost all our weapons. Suddenly, my father came in. I knew he was looking at me... but the game was more important at that moment. You couldn't die. My father opened the door. He never opens the door completely. He just opened it slightly. (A deep sigh) He looked just like the king in the game I was fighting against. So I said, "Oh, Dad." I don't know why but I said, "It's not what you think it is." I don't even know what I was trying to say. No matter what that was supposed to mean, I said, "Dad, It's not what you think it is." - "Dad..." - You had to survive. "Dad, the thing is..." The game was over the moment I turned back. Everything was over. When I turned off my computer, I realised how silent it was in the house. That's when I came to think, if I had a son like me, It was then. I would be really worried. What was your mother like? My mother was more open-minded than my father. - She didn't nag you? - No. But shockingly, it was my mother who told me to quit. After remaining silent for years? I had thought she was on my side. One day, she took me to a nice restaurant. She ordered so much food for me. When I was gobbling down the food, she said, "Dong Hwi, why don't you quit now?" (Why don't you quit now?) (His mother surprised him.) There was nothing to do. I would just go out and stroll around. But I couldn't stay out too long. I was broke and I would get tired. So I decided to go out right before my father gets home... so that I would spend as little time as possible outside. - I see. - Did you want to avoid him? It's not that he wanted to go out. My father would come home at exactly the same time every day. He's a very punctual person. I could see him when I looked out the window. While keeping an eye on him, I would go out to the hallway... and hide in the emergency exit. When I hear the elevator arrive... and him walking to the door, I would go down... and walk around the park. - Were you trying to avoid him? - Yes. I usually practised lines from movies while walking. As people might find it strange, I would wear a mask... and practise my favourite lines. I see. My father used to tell me, instead of sitting still, I should move around while thinking. He said I shouldn't sit still while thinking. You should move around. It sounds like your father had a lot of influence on you. In the past, I didn't understand why my parents pushed me so much. One day, I was so stressed out and called Cho Jung Seok. He told me that... it would help me in the end... and I would appreciate it someday. He was right. You're a hard worker. You said you watched more than 1,000 movies. I think I watched a few hundred movies at least. You sent your profile to more than 250 producers, too. That's right. I'm sure it was a lot more than 250. Even so, I was only able to audition for less than 10 times for a year. - That's the way it is. - Most of them never called. When did your father recognise your efforts? The moment I was on television. - Which one was that? - I was in "Gunman in Joseon". It was that one. - He must have been relieved. - What did he say to you? I love shoes. When I buy a similar pair, my father would throw them away. He would say, "Why did you buy the same shoes again?" These days, even if I have 10 pairs of the same shoes... I'm talking about exactly the same shoes. He says, "They are all different in detail." - He's changed. - But they're exactly the same. He's been so happy ever since I was on TV for the first time. He never nags me any more. Even if I play games while watching a football match... and even if I make a mess... with my legs on my desk, he says, "He's such an artist." (He's such an artist.) (Wittiness runs in his family.) Dong Hwi says he's grateful to actor Park Seo Jun. We went to college together. He used to cheer me up when I didn't have a job. He also helped me be in the movie, "The Beauty Inside". - He did? - He received the scenario first... and thought the role would fit me better. - He recommended. - He suggested I read it... and get in touch with them. Dong Hwi is still keeping an old text message from Seo Jun... and we have it here. It's from 2013. "You're so talented. I'm sure you'll become successful." "I just wanted to tell you." It must have given you so much energy. I appreciated it. He already had a job back then. It was when I was trying to avoid my father. Was it when you said, "It's not what you think it is"? Exactly. I didn't even know what I was trying to say. (I didn't even know what I was trying to say.) Min, instead of an acting audition, you debuted by winning "VJ Competition". Even though I wanted to become an actor, as Dong Hwi said earlier, I didn't have many chances to audition. I wanted to do as many auditions as possible. That's why I entered "VJ competition"... and surprisingly, I won. When I had been working for three months, the producer told me I should look more stylish... and suggested that I dye my hair blue. - So I did. - Blue? It just didn't look right. Isn't the background screen for VJs usually blue? (He's still embarrassed.) - Your head... - Your head might become invisible. (VJ Namkoong Min) Dying techniques were not as advanced back then. My hair looked like it had been burnt. - I can imagine. - It was terrible. In addition to that, I wore glasses back then. The lenses were tinted as it was in trend. That was in fashion, in addition to tight t-shirts. I looked terrible with those tinted glasses and blue hair. - Everyone looked terrible. - In addition to that, my hair was too hard to comb through. Are you searching for "Namkoong Min in blue hair"? - You won't be able to find it. - Is it too old? You'll never find it. (Please report to Radio Star when you find the pictures.) Before the debut, Seol Hyun is said to have been very shy. You couldn't even order in food... or push the button in buses. - Were you that shy? - Is it because you were sorry? I didn't want to attract any attention. You couldn't stand people looking at you. Then what did you do when you had to get off the bus? I would miss the stop... or wait for others to push the button. Pushing through the crowd to press the button... felt overwhelming to me. - You thought too much. - Exactly. I was terrible at presentations in school as well. I tried my best not to attract any attention... when I was in school. I'd guess it was impossible for you to not attract attention. Many people assume that I was popular in school... but I was hardly noticeable. - Really? - Yes. Even though you were shy, in ninth grade, you won "School Uniform Modelling Competition". How is it possible if you were shy? I was a model for my school as I was close to my teachers. - While modelling for my school, - She stood out. my friend suggested we enter the competition. She couldn't even push the button in the bus. Look at the clothes she's wearing. She said she was shy. (It's attracting everyone's attention.) She bent every possible part of her body. (She bent every possible part of her body.) - Were you in middle school? - Yes, I was 16 years old. Did you win this competition? Yes, I did. (Those waves don't look so shy.) (In what sense were you shy?) Seol Hyun, you said you have secrets regarding your body. Is it true that you have a white spot on your belly? - Do you have a white spot? - I have two. I have one large spot right next to my belly button. Do you cover it when you have to expose it? I have the parts around it painted lighter. I used to have a white spot on my tooth as well. - On your tooth? - I had it removed, though. - I have a mole on my tongue, too. - Show us. Oh, it's on the tip of your tongue. It looks like a rash. - But it doesn't hurt? - No. - Can I have a closer look? - Well... People might think you have a white tongue. - Let me see. - Why would you do that? I need to. - Don't touch it. - Don't touch it. Where is it? (It's here.) I'm not sure. - I'm not so sure. - Did you see her? She said, "It's here." (This talented girl is so innocent.) Dong Hwi, do you have any interesting physical traits? I can whistle without moving my lips. - Do you mean like this? - No, that's not it. I don't think so. (His lips are not moving.) - He's like a ventriloquist. - I pulled a lot of pranks with it. - How? - They didn't know who it was? Even when the teacher was looking... (He secretly whistled right in front of the teacher.) - That's amazing. - Even when he was right there... (The teacher was standing right next to him.) (He's a good storyteller.) Seol Hyun has a secret sleeping habit. You have to rub your lips against something to fall asleep. - What is it? - I'm jealous. There's this blanket I've been using since I was little. - Do you still have it? - Yes. It's all worn out now. When I travel abroad or go to another city, - Do you carry it with you? - I heard about that. I carry it with me and rub my lips against it. It helps me relax no matter where I am. Is it a habit? You could say that. I feel like I won't be able to sleep without it. - Is it like a jinx? - No, that's not it. It's not a jinx. In English, it's called an obsession. - What? - An obsession. What's that? - An obsession. - What? - Obsession. - Obsession? What obsession? Jung Soo, you were in the special episode of "Real Men". It'll be aired soon. I heard you got in trouble because Lee Dong Jun... was funnier than you. Dong Jun volunteered to be the squad leader. He has a very special way of speaking. (He talks like this.) He does this all the time. "Order the squad to stand at attention." "Squad, stand at attention. Salute." - That's hilarious. - "Don't make that sound." "I understand." He talks like this all the time. He couldn't stop making that sound. "Don't make that sound. Understood?" "Yes, Sir." He couldn't stop doing it. We were punished the whole time because of him. He was so funny when he was on Radio Star, too. "March forward. Turn left." "One, two, three." What was it like to be in the army? I actually quite liked it. Yes, my mother was very sick... and I'm her only child. That's why I didn't go to army. Is she very unwell? She has hearing and speech impairments. Someone had to take care of her. I could've asked my relatives, but I thought it would be better if I looked after her. Then how do you communicate with her? As I've lived with her all my life, I know sign language. Even when I had huge debts and was stressed out, I never cried. I just complained a little. But recently, my mother's impairments have gotten worse. Once, she was sent to the intensive care unit. During that time, I cried a lot. - Are you her only child? - Yes. I'll become an orphan when she passes away. I couldn't stop thinking about that. Money didn't seem important. You can earn money. But you can't replace your family. He's a good son. - Everyone knows he's a good son. - He's such a good son. Shouldn't you get married as soon as possible? Does your mother know about Kim Sook? She's showing signs of Alzheimer's disease. It's hard for her to stay focused during the whole programme. When I had paid off the debts, I decided I needed to get married. But because of Sook, now it's become even harder. Is it because people think of you two as a couple? Yes. I could marry Sook... - but... - You're keeping your options open. Don't take it too seriously. - I'm just saying it could happen. - That'll be a happy ending. Actually, our producer's husband... is the producer of that programme. - It's her husband. - We're related. They got married because they loved each other. How can she do this to me? (Joking) You are watching the high-end music programme, Radio Star. As we have so many talented stars with us today, our next segment... - is called "Songs That Flatter Me". - "Songs that Flatter Me". Let's listen to the song Namkoong Min chose. (Embarrassed) - Girls love this song. - It suits you. Min does seem to be a hopeless romantic. His voice is so soft. You do admit it, right? - Why did you choose this song? - He's a romantic. I thought I should choose a ballad song... but I didn't want it to be too depressing. I'm going to sing one of Sung Si Kyung's songs as well. - Really? - Then, you can go first. Why don't you sing Davichi's "Two Lovers" instead? Or sing Toy's "Three People". Seol Hyun, we heard your older sister is a famous fashion editor. - That's right. - What does she do? She works for a fashion magazine. Oh, really? Seol Hyun likes the colour pink... and her sister said people who like pink are usually bad dressers. It's not because I like pink. I'm just not interested in clothes. I wear clothes I like no matter what other people think. My sister complains that I don't listen to her advice... and wear whatever I like. - People say I'm a terrible dresser. - Really? I don't think you'll look good in pink. Dong Hwi loves the colour pink as well. - We found these online. - Look at this. (Dong Hwi loves to wear pink.) - That's cute. - Pick your favourite. Which one do you like the most? I like the one on the top. - This one? - Yes. Watch where your pointing. - Do you mean this one? - Yes. I think they all look nice. He looks good in pink. I'm the same as Seol Hyun. No matter what other people think, - You wear what you like. - I wear what I like. - That's important. - Why do you like the colour pink? I have a feeling it'll become trendy soon. Your ring makes you look like a magician. My father worked in Yemen in the Middle East... when I was little. He worked hard in Yemen and bought this ring there. - It looks like a magician's ring. - A long time ago, Jung Soo... once criticised me for the way I dressed. - Did I? - Yes, you did. Why did I talk to such an unimportant person? Has your sister ever been exposed in the media? We had a photo shoot together once. - Let's look for it. - Let's find it. - Let's find it. - Her name is... - Kim Ju Hyun. - Kim Ju Hyun? (Wow) Let's all go over there and see it. Let's go. Let's take a look. - Let's go over there. - Look at her. - She's beautiful. - Hurry up. Look at this. - She's beautiful. - Let me see. (They're in love with Seol Hyun's sister.) She's beautiful. Everyone is doing the same gesture. Don't zoom in too much. - She's very pretty. - She's beautiful. (Seol Hyun's older sister) Show it to us, too. Look at Gook Jin. - She's really beautiful. - Yes, she is. Is this your sister, too? - That's me. - That's Seol Hyun. - You're impressed by everything. - It's my habit. I did the same thing when I first met Kim Sook. Dong Hwi, before you became an actor, you worked with rich kids. There was a huge English institute in Songpa-gu. The parents are enthusiastic about education. My job was to guide the kids from the 5th floor to the 1st floor... and put them in the car. The kids were very naughty. They would say, "There comes the blocker." I would stop them from running away. (He was called the blocker.) - Did they call you that? - Were they middle school students? - Elementary school students. - I see. I often walked them down to the parking lot. It was a good opportunity to practise my acting skills. Did you play an evil character in front of them? I pretended to be angry with them. After I did that, I got fired the next week. Let's listen to Min sing "It Would Be Good". You don't have to clap your hands. ("It Would Be Good" by Sung Si Kyung) (Lowering the key) Wouldn't that be too low? (It would be good) (I like it.) (The original key is...) (If I walked on this street) (No one would have noticed.) (If only you knew that you're my everything) (It would be good) (Woo) (You tell me about the guy you met the other day) (He's trying his best.) (You told me he called you) (You seem to be blushing) (He gained popularity due to his portrayal of a villain,) (but he still has an innocent voice.) (Namkoong Min has so many different charms.) (If you could comfort me) (It would be good) That's it. Thank you. You know, with the lowered key... I could sing it like that. I should sing it sometime. What a nice thing to know. I will add "It Would Be Good" to my repertoire. - Lower it by four keys. - Would that do the trick? I could sing it like that. Thank you for the performance. Let's listen to the song Dong Hwi has chosen. (Which song did Dong Hwi choose?) - It's another song by Si Kyung. - How nice. Many people sing this song at weddings. ("Two People" is a song from Sung Si Kyung's fourth album.) - Isn't it a difficult song to sing? - Dong Hwi. - Dong Hwi must be a good singer. - I don't know. I haven't sung it. Why did you choose this song? I wanted to sing a song that sets the mood. It looks like Min's singing skills will... - pale in comparison to Dong Hwi's. - I know. - He chose a great song. - Dong Hwi will finish Min off. I had no idea Min would choose a song by Sung Si Kyung. We should've chosen the same song. He showed you some mercy. He won't finish you off completely. (I understand now.) Apparently, Dong Hwi and his friend Byun Yo Han... - are obsessed with karaoke. - That's right. - You even sing the second verse. - That's right. It became a habit for both Yo Han and myself. - Will you do the same today? - I don't know when I'll stop. I wonder if we can skip the first verse. (That's an idea.) When we start to clap, - that's when you should stop. - Okay. That's the cue for you to stop singing. When I say, "That's amazing", what I really mean is, "Stop singing." "He is singing so passionately." (I got it.) Someone told us that you did... - a good deed, Jung Soo. - What was it? I did a good deed? - It was submitted by Park Ji Eun. - It's about time. It was submitted by Park Ji Eun. "It was towards the end of 2014..." "when I met Yoon Jung Soo at a cafe around Hongdae." "He took a picture with me and bought drinks..." "for me and my 10 friends." "Jung Soo told us to order something expensive." - "So my friends did that." - They did order expensive drinks. "I am sorry that we made you spend a lot of money." - They didn't know my situation. - "We didn't know of his hardship." "But since that day," "Jung Soo became our favourite comedian." "We like him more than Yu Jae Seok." "I hope people would hear about this good deed." Why did you buy them drinks? They came in to the cafe and the students... ordered only six drinks despite there being 10 of them. - They didn't have a lot of money. - You know, I had to buy them the drinks even though I was struggling myself. When I told them to order whatever they wanted, they ordered cakes and bread, too. I said, "Order what you want." - I felt bad for them. - You are really warm person. - Jung Soo is a nice man. - I know. I think your image on TV... is very important. - That's right. - I was on my way to a shoot... when I heard someone was waiting for me. A middle-aged woman approached me... with an envelope full of documents. She explained to me... that the documents contain information about real estate. She wanted me to talk about it on TV so that we can split the profit. (Does Gu Ra look like he needs money?) I didn't know what to do. (Gu Ra always has an interesting story.) - I was so taken aback. - Jung Soo, I am sorry... that Gu Ra keeps inserting his own story. It seems like he won't hear more about your heart-warming deed. (Gu Ra is the worst.) - Jung Soo. - I told her, "I can't do that." - I refused. - We're sorry. - Jung Soo is a nice man. - That's right. Let's hear a song. - Dong Hwi will... - I have no power. - Please don't ask me. - Gu Ra, come on. - We were talking about Jung Soo. - Gu Ra, you are my junior. - I have no power. - We got it. Stop. I don't understand why people keep coming to me. - Dong Hwi will sing "Two People". - Go to the broadcasting station. - I have no power. - Jung Soo and Gu Ra make two. What? (Dong Hwi will now sing.) ("Two People" by Lee Dong Hwi) (A tiring day has passed) (Two people stand under the moonlight) (And cast one shadow) (A peaceful atmosphere fills the studio.) (Dong Hwi stops joking around and shows us his charming side.) (Please remember) (The person who loves you with a bleeding heart) (Is by your side) (Shall I change the tempo?) (The road we are on) (Adding chorus) (May seem long) (Ad-libbing) (What is it?) (He is singing the chorus, too.) (Let's watch it again.) (He is singing the chorus.) (I did a good job.) (He returns to his serious self.) (But it is not easy to forget...) (the image of him singing the chorus.) (They have fallen for Dong Hwi's charms.) (Should I keep singing?) That was great. He can sing very well. If they make a movie about Tak Jae Hoon in the future, - Dong Hwi should star in it. - What kind of movie would that be? - What kind of movie would that be? - Jae Hoon would need to die first. No. He can convey emotions very well. - We enjoyed the performance. - Thank you. The reason why... these four guests could become the very best... is because they put 100 percent into everything they did. We hope they will continue to thrive. We will say good bye here. See you next week. - Please! - Please! (See you again next week!) (Next Week) Why are you laughing at my girlfriend? (The cry of a man) Is that really what happened? I had no idea. - That's what I thought. - What a story. I heard a lot about you from Ji Min. - You will always be mediocre. - How rude. Get your facts straight, Gu Ra. (They're badmouthing each other.) (This is the Serengeti of variety programmes.) - Think about the money. - If I get that much money... (He sheds crocodile tears for his friend.) - I am very happy. - The door is open. You need to watch your backs. (NAVI in the Ongdalsaem Special) This is funny. ("No Lullaby for Cowgirl" by W)
