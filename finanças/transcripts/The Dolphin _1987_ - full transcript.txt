"Garlic peel Pepper powder Help this woman See if she can take it Pepper powder Garlic peel If born boy Everts unlike Turn him into an animal That I take to the sea He is the son of a Dolphin He knows how to swim" It is to pass in these waters... I don't know. A spine cold. My God! A longing mystery. Three days we spent here, and they still remain. Go and come back, go and come back... I don't know. I think this story goes far. They must be going somewhere, and stopped here... to eat our mullets. Soon they will be leaving, you will see. That's what everyone says. But I saw, a long time ago, they stayed here for over a year. -They left no fish for anyone. -Not even fish... nor sad little woman, is it or not? Boy, no kidding. Not kidding about it. This is serious. -You're saying what everyone knows. -Then. Not everyone knows what he says, not everyone sees what he looks at. -Careful, huh? -Are you talking about Z? Amaro? -What do you think? -And what do you know? What I know? His wife disappeared because of the Dolphin. Nonsense. -And did he believe that? -I dont know... but there's a lot of Z? Amaro out there. There are people who think everything is fine at home, and one day, come home and sees a surprise belly. This was the Z? Amaro's case. Do you remember Tereza, the eldest daughter? One day the belly grew, the people left saying: "Thats the Dolphin, darn!". And I will say more: This story of Dolphin here is not from today, no. Smart Dolphin and woman with desire, it is the perfect union. I've heard stories told by the Indians who lived here, They called it "The Ibupiara Dolphin, the fish that became male and fished the female, you know? Wow! Thats the Dolphin! Well, but you?ll also see that it?s nothing like that. You will see that it is all an excuse for the lack of fish... in the belly of the girls, to explain the belly full of other things... I know this here from the time that manioc was planted, made flour mixed with fish stock and banana. And if you ate the best navy blue you could have. Today's gang doesn't want anything, blame others. Everyone is selling the skin to buy engine for the boat. Then he sells what he doesn't have to put gas in the engine. But see if you can! There is one that always takes advantage. It happened with Z? Amaro. Who took advantage was Rufino. In fact, everyone started to depend on Rufino. And he... getting rich. Just getting rich. -What happened now, Z? Amaro? -The sea is bad for fishing. And me? who pays? -I'm also at a loss. -I'll not continue paying this, no. The oil is too expensive and ice costs money. There are no more sardines out there. -They blow everything away. -Less beautiful woman. Now, there is a way to solve this business. Negotiating ownership of that land. This makes money. Makes a lot of money. How was it, father? The time has passed and Tereza did not get married. She became a silent girl, full of desires. Daydreaming. Wishing and waiting. Waiting and wishing. -There she goes. -All hopeful. -Look there. -Dolphin's woman. There she goes. Did you see? -And don't talk to anyone anymore. -And you think... will she catch a crab anyway? -Who is it? -It's me, Maria, your sister. Let me in, Z?. I need. Who is it, father? Aunt? Hey, aunt. Come in, aunt. We have nowhere to go. I thought Luciano could help your father with fishing. -Just for a while. -Stay there as long as you want. -Corina! -Hey, aunt, your blessing. -Get your cousin a place to sleep. -Anything for you... -eat, drink... -Don't need. Don't need. Will need. Rest there. Oh, Corina. God bless you. Everything is fine. Comes. Here's bad, uncle. It can break at any time It's like having nowhere to sleep. Luciano, they said that he was the son of a Dolphin. Yeah, the same is said of those who don't know their real father. So it was his story. And, as he was related to people... like Tereza, well, then, the fame of a Dolphin son spread. Quiet boy, good fisherman, by the way... after all the trouble, no more was heard of him. Look! How many of them, huh? I know a good place to fish. Stay in that direction. It's good to fish there. Come on. I myself came here full of bottles. Don't tell me that! -Dilson! -Just eat... flour with banana one day, banana with flour the next... It was so much, I even gave it to Z? Amaro, to Dona Zez?... For you too, wasn't it, Dudu? -Shrimp... -I was taking shrimp. The year was beginning. Here it was full of people.. D?lson! How many pounds did you take? 150. That was today, right? Last week it was double, remember? I need a guarantee, master. Put your finger there. Dad, what is that? I'll stick you a harpoon! -I will rip you! -Dad! Leave me! Get out, bitch! -Get out, bitch! -What do you want? Disgrace. -Father. Tereza! -Leave me! -Tereza! -Get out! Get out! I'm going to stick you a harpoon, Dolphin. -What it was? -Get out, bitch! -What are you doing? -Drop it! -Stop it! -Drop it! He's insane again. Watch his head, he's insane again. Dad... Go, leave. Go. Go. Z? Amaro was really sick, affected. He hadn't known what he was doing for a long time, lost in the curse of the Dolphin story. That's right. One day, the sun hadn't even appeared yet and he, alone, disappeared swimming into the sea. They said the disappearance was out of shame for his daughter. Really? They said so much... who was a bad fisherman, even lazy. And that went away to stretch elsewhere. Nothing like that! Nothing at all! He was the best in this place. Until his wife disappears. So, he was losing the will to live. He was inert. Always distant thinking. -There is no way to know, right? -He was crazy. Cut his drinks... Madness is a disease that we only see when it appears in others. Don't you think the same? -But, he didn't kill himself? -killed himself, didn't he? Nobody knows. Nobody saw. Well, the truth is, after about three days, the sea gave news of Z? Amaro. Underdog. Poor father, aunt. I was saving... Now we're going to be a problem, Tereza. Nothing at all. Where they eat two, they eat three, four. Hi. Sit down. Sit down. Hello? Hello? Darel speaking. Speak louder. Yes, heard on listening, speak. Speaks! Good Morning. I just want to know when the foreigners at the hotel will arrive. It's to accommodate them. It's not a big city here. I know, there's still something to see. There will be no problem, no. There will be no problem! Ok, see you next time. Hang up, huh? I'm sorry, Tereza. I'm really sorry. I'm here to pay my father's debt. I'll leave something up to you. Here. Your father left everything very well organized. There is no more debt. As well? It was a power of attorney that he passed on to me. I will negotiate for him. Did my father sell the possession? Practically. You also don't need to make that face. I am not your creditor, I want to be your friend. A friend you can trust. -I appreciate it, but... -Do not worry. I will pay this debt until the last penny, it's here, look. That's why I like you. Proud. -I'm not leaving my house. -Who said that? Do you need to leave? Stay there, calm. -Are you going to pilot your uncle's boat? -Yes. So I make a point of supplying. I like you very much, Tereza. So much. Give me a slice? Eat it all. Ah, Luciano, it's you! Stop it! Get down, get down! I knew it was you. I knew it. Come here, you shameless! Stop! -What is it? -Gift for you. Open it. Open it. I can't accept it, Mr. Rufino. The Amaro's daughter can surrender for love, -not for money. -You don't know me well... I have money, so what? But I have feelings, heart. There are a lot of women in this world, you don't need me. In fact, I don't need you. I want you, Tereza. I don't love you. In these things, money doesn't help. It doesn't matter, love will come with time... with the affection that I will give you, with the coexistence. -People talk about me, huh? -I know they talk, but I don't care. I think of both of us. Marry with me, Tereza, please. -Mr. Rufino... -You don't have to answer now. Look. Look how beautiful! Look. I want you with me, Tereza, at the St. John party. Tereza! Tereza, come! Come, aunt! Rufino, are we going home? What's the problem? Something happened? Let's stay. -So, stay with me. -Do you need to ask? Yead, but is in this type of party that the Dolphin takes the girls. It's a lie. This is an excuse of idle woman. No, it is not. He arrives at parties and hangs around, drinking. Yeah, he says he doesn't take his hat off for nothing, to hide the hole in his head. That one is not. One less. A Macaw! Julinho, play a Macaw! Let's see if there is a Dolphin here. Come on, Julinho, play a macaw! Let's go. Let's get him, guys! Let's take him! -Wait, boy! -Take it! Take it! Take off his hat! Don't let him get away. -Come on, Lourival. -Come on! -Excuse me! -Catch him! Catch him! Catch him! Catch the Dolphin! -What happened? -Catch him! Catch him! Catch him! Get the naughty Dolphin! Catch him! -Hit him, Lourival! -Please! It's the bald guy. Is not the Dolphin! And there's no hole in the head. That hole in his head was the one we made. Get this guy out of here! -Does anyone know him? -It's not from here. Then let's go. It's just a macaw. Ah, my balloon, my balloon Rises high, very high Tell her to give her heart -Girls, it's bath time. -Let's go. Did you see how beautiful? Come on, it's time to place the order. Come with me. Comes. Comes. Come, Tereza. They got the Dolphin. He was bald and had 7 children. Moonlight, moonlight, which brightens the Earth, which brightens the sea Make me dream who I'm going to marry Moonlight, moonlight, which brightens the Earth, which brightens the sea Make me dream who I'm going to marry Pequetita is waiting for you there in the square. It's noted that you are not from here. No man can spy on the girls on the night of St. John. I just arrived. Too bad, huh? I swear I didn't see anything. What's your name? Don't you have a name? -Yes, my name is Corina. -Ah, Corina. Close your eyes, Corina. I'll give you a gift. Tereza? -You are sleeping? -No. They say that, on a full moon night, he... he, the Dolphin, he comes out of the sea and becomes a boy... and come to earth to date. They say he... They say he is a handsome guy, very kind to the girls, they say that no girl can resist him, because he looks like a prince. I wish one day he would come to date me. -Shut up, Corina! -Hey, why? Shut up and sleep! Me, huh? My God! Oh, Corina. Can you bring me a drink? Go. Do you know my sister? I know her sister. It's me! But she pretends that she doesn't know me. Hadn't you asked me to come back? I went back. You look better. I came back to get you. Come with me. Comes. Come on, Corina. -Comes. -I'm not going. I'm not going. I do not want. I am not going. I am not going. I do not want. Do not. I do not want to go. -Corina! -I am not going! I am not going. I am not going. Don't catch fish, Okay. But don't take anything... I've seen everything. I want to see it in the warehouse. And what are you going to do? It's their fault. The Dolphin is a damned animal, you know that. -Excuse me for intruding... -Well, you can talk. But it reminds me of an old story... since caveman times. -Do you know how they caught the fish? -They killed the Dolphin. No. They went out to fishing at night. It's not when the Dolphin hunting the man's wife? Big idea. Are you from here? No, I travel a lot. Take another drink, the expense is mine. You can hit a lot. No fish will appear.... just Dolphins. They're coming. Surrounded the mullets, and now will appear here. Go over there, Manoel. Towards the channel. Yeah, over there. But why didn't they go fishing at night? The idea was a good one, and they never were. Hey, and that's not what they did, boy? Yes, but if they had thought, they wouldn't have gone. Oh, yes. It's a truth. These people are always deceived. It couldn't be different, could it? While they were fishing at night, the Dolphin fished on their bed. Nobody saw the Dolphin appear. What the hell, huh? Only women saw. Woman has an eye for fishing Dolphins. He arrived and the sad women they were happy. Wow! And husbands fishing in the dark and finding nothing. In fact, I don't even know who was fishing who, did you see? And the dolphin entered the story and in the women, and it's a fact. The women said to the men: "Go fishing, go." And the husbands went. -I'm afraid, aunt. -Fear of what? I'm afraid. Sometimes, I think I'm going crazy. I saw him all the time at the party. He who? -I saw the Dolphin. -The Dolphin? I saw it, I saw it, I swear. I saw it. Since you came back, I have the impression that he is close to me. -That is around, bothering me. -And he is. What are you saying? He asked me to come here. -He who? -Luciano. Luciano? Luciano is the son of a Dolphin. -What you want? -Mother... -"Mother"? -I want you. I am not your mother! I am not your mother! Get out of here! Get out of here! I am not your mother! Get out! Get out! Get out of here! Get out of here! Get out of here! Go! Go! Out of here! Get out of here! I am not your mother! Get out of here! Get out of here! Get out! Get out! Get out of here! Get out of here! I am not your mother! I am not your mother! Get out of here! Get out of here! Get out! Get out! Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! I am not your mother. -Long live the bride and groom! -Hurray! Hurray! Long live the bride and groom! Hurray! Are you happy? Come! Great Rufino! Today is the happiest day of my life! Just married and already rules over me. Wants to stay here. Let's enjoy the good things. And forget the bad things. Let's make a toast! -A toast! -A toast to the great friend! Let's celebrate, guys! Let's celebrate! One minute! Wait a minute, guys! The party is not over. Don't touch it! The party is not over! One minute! Don't leave, the party isn't over! The party is not over! Don't go away! It's just a high wind The party is not over! Don't go away. Don't go away. Don't go away, please, the party isn't over! Nobody could explain that high wind. Hey, high wind, it was just at the party. It was a passionate wind, and only Tereza understood. But she kept the secret inside her. -Who is it, Tereza? -Nothing. It's the wind again. I'm thinking of selling this for foreigners. I will transform the place in a hotel. Will be better for me, for you. What do you think? I'm talking to you, are you going deaf? Water. Water! And your father died poor. Idiot! Your mother was right. You are crazy like him! -Come here. -Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Protect Corina. Against what? -Against him. -Are you asking for your sister... or for you? What did you do, you bastard? Corina! Corina, talk to me! Corina, stop it. Stop, Corina. Corina. It's me, Corina. Corina! Corina! Corina! Corina! Corina! Corina. Now it's like this, I don't know how it will end. It doesn't surprise me, the girl was so beautiful. Do you remember her? And everyone liked her. Beautiful. When she disappeared, we've been looking for her for a long time. We searched for 2 days and not even the body appeared. Corina! Corina! I will stop. -Give me. -You have to adjust... the accounts with the Dolphin. You are the son of the Dolphin. A lot of people talk about cursing. It's very stupid. But it's a lot of coincidence, this is a fact. That's it, everyone is suffering for Tereza. Ah, everyone suffers, right? Even Rufino. Who told him to marry with the Dolphin's woman? He's fine, getting rich at our expense. selling everything, even using phone. -Only a blind cannot see. -He shouldn't have married Tereza. That's why things are this way. Stop being stupid! Rufino! Where do you know me from? Rufino! Now... Who sent you? Souza? "Hombre"... Didn't he tell you? -Is it to talk about business? -I called you... -You were from that group... -Sure! -Then come with me, please. -"Man!" Please, this way. Is what I want. This was what I looking for. It's perfect, perfect. That house... that house is perfect. That house is very good. We will destroy. Build something more modern, making a world-class hotel, with tiles, everything. -I want to make a deck. -Tereza! Come and meet the buyer of the house. -Yes, a deck. -Come here. How are you, my lady? Are not you cold, Rufino? Would you have... -something for us? -Do we have candy? No, not candy. You know, I'm sorry, but... -A drink! Pure. -Do you have a drink? -No, it was over last night. -Have on the speedboat. -I'll be back. -Please, don't bother. Don't you recognize the friends, Tereza? Yeah, and it happened! Rufino didn't realize that he put the devil into his house. -He did it himself. -Are you seeing? Is that the foreigner? Rufino is planning something. You can believe. There is something mysterious in the air. Thanks, huh? Tereza! Tereza, take the glasses. Oh, very good! Very good. There was no need to bother. A toast to the hotel. And what a hotel! Rufino, you will see. I want to do everything, everything. Sauna, swimming pool, bodybuilding... Everything, everything. A divine hotel. To the hotel and the Mrs. Tereza. Good, good. Rufino, Won't you show me the river? It is very close, I'll show you. Come on. Yes, let's go. Well, Mrs. Tereza, I'll see you later. I hope that soon. -Let's go? -Yes. Come on, Rufino. I won't be long, Tereza. Could you stop here, Rufino? Great! Thats beautiful, Rufino! Rufino, what a river! -You can swim here, can't you? -Of course! I really like to swim. Is it cold, Rufino? Hold on. These foreigners... Let's go, Cac?! Let's get out of here! Let's go! Tereza! Tereza! Tereza! You can take the gas, but I want you to catch the Dolphin. You've gone! You get out here. I want the Dolphin dead. Get closer. Tereza will be with him, I want her back! I want you to search everywhere. There's gas for everyone. They even made a procession to bless the sea. Everything to scare the dolphin. Many people, of course, took advantage. What to expect from a man in this type of situation? He thought he could end the Dolphin. -At least that's what he wanted. -And did he succeed? Look at them, around us, look over there. -Tereza! -Tereza! -Go away, shameless! -We don't want you here anymore, Dolphin's woman! Oh, Tereza, come here, we want to talk to you. -What do you want? -We want speak to Tereza. -Yeah, call Tereza. -Get out of here! You wretches! -Get out of here! -You like her, Rufino! -Kick her out! -Dolphin's woman! Take it! Take it! Don't let the Dolphin get away! -Catch him! -Get the Dolphin! -Catch him! -Don't let him get away! Get the Dolphin! Get the Dolphin! Come on, guys! Catch him! Catch him! Catch him! Where is he? Look for him! Go ahead. Get the Dolphin! Get the Dolphin! -Take it! Get the Dolphin! -Catch him! -Don't let him get away! -Catch him! Get the Dolphin! Catch him! -Catch him! -Catch him! -Catch him! -Come on! Where is he? Is he gone again? He disappeared, people! Where is he? -Look at him there! -Let's go! Get the Dolphin! Catch him! He went there! He went there! Go! Go! Go. Wait, but was it him? -Yes, it was him. -Yes. -It was him. -Come on, it was him! Let's run! Let's go! They say that only Dolphin's son can kill a Dolphin. Yes, but it is very risky, because the enchantment may to involve the one who kills and he can become a Dolphin too. But to really kill, they say it must be with Inaj?'s harpoon. -Bullshit! -Well, that's what people say. It can be any harpoon. But as he was the son of Dolphin, -it was three-pointed. -But it must be at the full moon. Ibupiara! Yeah, I think they are advancing out to sea. -They're really leaving. -Gosh! At last we will have fish again. Come here, my dear, come here! Look at how they smell fish. They're having a party. Come, you can come. Come on. There is fish for everyone. It's small price. Just choose. You can come! She has a full belly, she wants nothing more. Come on, let's go. Time to throw the fishing net into the sea.
