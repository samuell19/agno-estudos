At long last, it's summer vacation... We can finally go on a picnic by the river! My father already spoke with Mr. Kulas. You're getting circumcised as well? My grandmother also spoke with Mr. Kulas... - Let's do it together. - That will be great! Your mother will be proud of you for getting another medal in school. What do you think she will reward you with? She gave you a bicycle last time. I'm sure you're going to be a scholar in high school. You got good grades, unlike me. I hardly passed! I told you to copy my test answers during exams. I don't want to! My Grandma Ising told me that it's more rewarding when you work hard for something. Come on, let's race! Winner gets to be the passenger while the loser pedals the bicycle. Game? Game? Remember, the loser has to pedal! Adong. Help me! Sucker! This is my kingdom and I'm honored to have you as my guest. And as your king I order you to do everything that I want. Yes, your majesty! Get that! Imagine that Mr. Kulas is the tin can... I really can't do it! You give up too easily. Try to relax... take a deep breath... exhale... Good. Hold the slingshot tight... imagine hitting the tin can... Look at the tin can, not me! Can you hear the sound of the tin can falling to the ground? Take aim. Concentrate... release! You hit it! That was great! One more time! See? I told you. If you think it will happen then it will. There. Take another shot. Run! Jump into the river. Start chewing the guava leaves. Keep chewing. My goodness, is that thing erect? Take good care of that... it will be your main asset when the time comes. The penis is a man's most powerful weapon. It can make or break you! Hold your head up high. Chew! Like that! Run to the river. Hey Adong! Your rent is late again! When are you going to pay? When? Next week, Aling Urata! Business is slow these days... Slow? When are you going to pay? - I told you, next week. Do you want me to kick you out of my condo unit? If you can't pay me half the rent by next week, I'll throw all your belongings in the river. Remember that! Carry me. Hey, Mrs. Pining! When are you going to pay? Do you even intend to pay your rent? Look at your kid! Grandma, will you stop fanning yourself?! Let's go! - Lady, calm down! Mind your own business. Hey, addict! I'm going to tell your mother about your bad habit. Time to pay the rent! Do you have any intention of paying? Joan needs to take this medicine three times a day... I still have money here. Where did you get the money? Well, I did some work at the condo... take it, please! No. Take it, please take it. Coffee? Two please. Is it good? - Joanna! Your companion keeps getting younger! Too bad for you. I can't help it if I'm pretty! Excuse me. That's huge. Do you want it? Not here. Let's go upstairs. Rent is only 50 pesos. Sister! There are no more men downstairs... they're all upstairs. Why are you doing business in a place like this? You're good-looking. That face. That body. And more important, that dick of yours. You know you'd really sell in a gay bar. You'll get by just on tips. I don't know how to dance. Here. I organize shows at the bath house... Bath house? What happens there? Just call me... you'll find out when you get there. What's your name? Eh? ...Maynard. I don't kiss. Thanks for telling me that Grandma has been waiting for me. No problem. Hi Grandma! I have a surprise for you, Menardo. - Seriously? So that you'll be protected from the sun and from the rain. Menardo, understand that, at your age, you should learn to overcome life's challenges. Thank you, Grandma. Where is Lorenzo? He went out with Adong. The heck with that kid! He hasn't helped with the chores all summer. Let him be. Why should I? That's why he's growing up irresponsible. You're tolerating his laziness. Hey, hey! Tomorrow you'll chop firewood, pump water from the well and fill the container! Tomorrow is Sunday. He'll be serving as altar boy in church. Hey! Did you hear what I said? It's this... it's this fucking slingshot! That's all you've been thinking of! Give it to me. Dad, give it back! - When did you learn to talk back? Leave him alone. It's just a petty thing. You were a kid once too. Give it to me. Let go! - Leave him alone! When I was a kid, I as working in the field. Harvesting rice! Catching fish! Kadyo, give that back to the boy! Please, it's just a petty thing. Shut up! Hard-headed kid. Is that what you want? Please don't. Stop that! You were a kid once too! Adong! I feel sorry for Enzo. Me too. He's always sad. Is it nice? - Yes! Grandma gave it to me last night. Does it suit me? - It does! You're not kidding me, are you? - Nope. Really? So that means I look very handsome. Enzo! - Enzo! Is she awake? Not yet. She's still sleeping soundly. That's good. Give this to her when she wakes up. Where did you get this? I got it back at the condo. Nice. I'll be going somewhere tonight. Please look after her. I will. I'll be going. Okay. Oh, and please don't forget her medicine. I won't. I'm very busy, Gerry. I have a meeting later. Mama Froi, just give me some of your time. Please. The problem with you is, you've been bringing all the men you find in that third-class cinema here in my club! What do you think of my place? Cheap? Of course not! - My vision for this place is to be "world class" Try this one out. He has a huge dick. - Huh? Ah, OK. Let's have a look. Let's go in. I knew you'd be interested. Why are you dressed like that? It's still early. The bitches downstairs might see you. My God! You know you're not supposed to play with women before the show. Because you might have problems getting an erection later. Okay. - Mama Froi's very busy. Oh! You're there. Okay, strip. Let me see your body. He's the one I've been telling you about. I'm sure you'll be happy with what you see. Okay. - You'll be impressed. You're sure about that? Maynard, strip. Looks like he has an attitude problem. It's taking him too long. What's wrong with you, Maynard? Strip! All of it? What did I tell you? Mama... Later, I'm busy. Mama Froi... Mama Froi! So what? Think you can handle that? Just a souvenir. Okay, Mark! He will do. Give him a tour. It's his first time. Mark, take care of him. What's your name? - Mama Froi. Let's go. I'll show you around. What about my budget? Come on... - What? I've already invested a lot of money in you. In fairness... Do I really have to be in a towel? Towels are the dress-code here. Nothing more, nothing less. You're not allowed to charge money here. No matter what size or color. Everything is free. Even blowjobs. What's your problem? I'm not gay. Neither am I. If you want me, you'll have to pay for it. The food here is great and cheap. Is he gay? - Huh? No. He's married with kids. Adong, I'm scared. Don't be scared... I'm here with you. Wait! Not too fast. - Hurry! Come on, let's climb the tower. - I don't want to. It's too scary. No, don't worry. You go first and I'll help you. Enzo, wait for me! Enzo! Help me Enzo! - Hold on! Stop fixing that. Here, take this. - Thanks. So that you won't get wet when it rains. Thank you Grandma! I'll be going Grandma! Try to get some rest. Menardo, do you know the secret to a good weave? When weaving, the thread should not be too loose or else it will be easily torn. And it should not be too tight or else it will become brittle and will also get torn easily. I finally got back at you, Melay! This is fun! Here! Here! Enzo! Did you see the foreigner a while ago when we were at the procession? Son of a bitch, she's got big boobs! Keep up! Did you know that we got coverage on TV? Did you see that? Wait, wait. It was the... Give me a hand. Melay's nipples were incredible! It must really feel good to play with them. I'm getting excited! By the way, she's coming over in a while. She's coming? Why? We're now sweethearts. Since when? Earlier, when we were getting wet at the procession. She said yes! Just don't tell her dad. If her dad finds out about it... we're dead! Wait, I've got some candy here. You want some? Thanks. In the meantime, I need you to be our "look out". Look out? It's cold! Adong! Stop! Adong, it's Melay! Wait, Melay! We'll be getting out of the water! What are you guys doing? Huh? Wait! Just stay there! Bro, just remember, you're our "look out". Are you done? Almost. Faster! It's taking you so long. Why did you do that? You were peeking, weren't you? Of course not, why would I do that? I thought you were going to visit me in Manila. I'm still trying to save up for the fare. How can you save up for the fare when you're taking a vocational course? Maybe I'll just borrow some money from Enzo. But his mom just borrowed money from my dad for his tuition. Really? - So now what? Have you heard the news of Grandma Ising's death? When? Last month. My father never mentioned anything about it. And how are you getting along? Well... sometimes I work in the garage, sometimes in construction, sometimes in the restaurant. You should see how handsome I am there. - I didn't know you were so hard-working. Hey, come closer. How about a kiss? I don't want to. What do you think of me? Come on! Please? Only one! On the cheek. Let's go down there. Be careful of your legs. I'm okay! Adong! Melay! Someone's coming! Adong? Melay? Adong! Stop kidding me! I love you, Adong! - I love you! - Enzo, let's meet back in town! Adong! - Bye bye, Enzo. Tell your mother that she still owes me money. Brother! - What's up? How about letting me join you in your racket. What racket? You're too... Too young? I have erections and pubic hair. Asshole! Why do you insist on staying in a place like this? Life is good here. I never get busted. Go home, bro. Go back to the province. Hey! Your addict friends are hanging around here again. What if the cops raid this place? Huh? Huh? It's not like you don't have the money to bribe the cops. Asshole! Bro! - What? For Joanne. - What's this? No need for this. Come on, it's for Joanne. It's my turn. Thanks. - Sure thing, Bro. Careful! Adong! What? Cut! Did you say, "Lawrence"? I said no ...! Watch those breasts. I told you not speak. I just want to hear moans. Did I say something? Why you called this guy "Dong"? What is the name of the movie? "The scandal of Puerto Galera"! Haven't we already used that title? - It was "Puerto Princesa". I want you to take it gently and I just want to hear sighs. Not a single word. Ready? - Yes Boss! Be silent! Listen up! The producers are going to kill me. We are spending a lot of rolls. Come on! In position! Is the camera ready? Yes, I'll tell you. Ursula, on top! Lawrence make us feel it! Okay? All right. Go, Lawrence! Ursula, yes! Just like that. More passion! Like that! Let's go! Enzo! Happy birthday! Every year you get more annoying. That's just how things are. What do you have there? Cover it up1 What is it? We'll save this for later. After we eat. This is dessert! Let's take a bath first! Give me your clothes, quick! - I don't want to! Forget that. It's your birthday, let's take a dip! That's okay. Go ahead, this will just take a minute. You're really annoying. I'm itchy all over! You're itchy? - Yeah, I came from the garage. Give that to me. I'll wash those as well. You know, a foreigner's car broke down along the highway. Good thing he paid me in Euros! Oh? - He even gave me a tip! A tip? - Yeah! Give me the soap. - Here. Close your eyes, friend. Huh? - Close your eyes. Why? Just do it. I have a gift for you. It's your birthday but you're the one giving me a gift? Close your eyes. You're just full of surprises. What's taking you so long? It's almost there. What? - You can open your eyes now. Not yet, I'm still visualizing it. Up to you! Okay, I will. What is it? You know I'm not fond of jewelry. Wait. It looks antique. Does the pendant symbolize the two of us? Where did you get the money to buy this? It was given to me by grandpa Cosme. Now it's my turn to give you a gift. Wait for me to put this on. Here, let me help you. Looks good! - Does it suit me? Of course. Now it's time for me to give you your gift. Dessert is served. Wow, Bro. This is great! Son of a bitch! Look at the boobs on that one! I'm getting really horny! Oh, Melay! Adong! - Melay! Yes! I'm coming, Adong! Cut. What the hell did you say again? Did I say something? I heard you say something! My god! We've been working on that fucking moan for a month! Direk, I think he said Dong, or was it Atong? Or Akong? My god, Lawrence, please! We're doing this again! Ready! Maynard, wear this. You're still wearing jewelry? Take it off! Don't be nervous. Relax. Your partner is on his way. Who did you get? Maurice got sick. But we were able to find his replacement. Is he good? Maurice said this guy has done several video sex scandals. Hurry up! We'll arrive late! Faster! Get dressed! Take a shower! What are you waiting for? You smell like beer! Fasten it well! Faster! People are waiting! Where's the button? Enzo? - Adong... But... Good thing we're the same size. Where are you guys going? I'm going over to Melay's. What's the occasion? It's her father's birthday. I'm going with Melay. You're the only one invited in our town. All the guests will be from Manila. Mother, they're already sweethearts. Does Melay's father know about this? We're planning to tell him today. Aling Norma, I'll go now. Enzo, thanks a lot. I'll return this tomorrow. Okay, take care. Good afternoon, Mr. Kadyo! Let's go! Dad! Melay! Wait! Enzo, I need your bike! Why? Hey! Where are you taking that? Come back here! Adong! Enzo! Adong! Enzo, no! Enzo! Son! Carmela! Help me. I'm going to take Carmela away. We're leaving this place. Only you can go near her! You're the only one who can go to her house! Please, help me. Adong! Melay! Eh! Friend. Thank you. Take care of yourselves. Thank you. Keep it, it's yours! Norma! Where's the bread? Enzo, where are you going? To Manila. What will you do there? Look for work. Son, you'll go hungry in Manila. Stay here and finish your studies. Go back to school? When will that be, Mom? I'm supposed to be in third year by now. How many times did I stop because we don't have money for tuition? Mom, I'm sick of waiting! I'm tired of making sausages! Kadyo, please top Enzo. Why should I? He's a grown man! Let him go! When he gets hungry he'll be back. Do you really think you can find Adong? Well, you're wrong! The police are looking for Adong. In the Pasig river! I'm sure that's where you'll find him. I know. What's so funny, Kadyo? Oh... you of all people... You should have been first to find out, because you're a woman. Isn't that right, Lorenzo? Faggot! Faggot! Son, no. You want to fight? You want to fight? What kind of job will you get in Manila? Huh? A manicurist? Kadyo, stop that. Stop! Faggot! What? Both of you stop it! Whatever I am today, it's all because of you! Whatever I want to do is none of your business! You've no more obligations. Leave me in peace! Enzo. Enzo. Both of you hurry up! A lot of people are waiting! Where did my button go? Looks like you got your buttons in the wrong holes. Let me see. Since when have you been here in Manila? Since right after you and Melay eloped. How is she? We're through. Really. Has it already been five years? Seems like it was just yesterday. All along I was imagining you already had a child back home. I'm still single. Seriously? Baby butt! Let's go! Wait. - What? Have you been doing this a long time? - Of course. What am I supposed to do? - Just copy me. Imagine I'm Melay. Smart ass! What? Concentrate. Relax. It's easy. If you think it's real, it's real. Just imagine we're the only two people in the world. Inhale... exhale. Like that, very good. Don't worry. Perfect. You were great! Where did you learn to act like that? I took an acting workshop from a director. Really now? So you're an actor? Can I get your autograph? I've also appeared in a few videos. It's a good thing that you were my partner. Who would have guessed? Well, well, well. The stars of the night. Congratulations. Our patrons enjoyed the show. Good job. You were like old lovers reunited again after so many years. I'll be getting the both of you again to star in my other sex shows! Maynard, there's someone who would like to meet you. He's rich! If you're interested, he'll pick you up and bring you to a hotel. You interested? - Well, sure. I'm OK, friend! I can go three more rounds. Money is not a problem! Just name your price! I'll just call you when your service gets here. Okay? Sure... sure. I thought we were going to do some catching up after the show? Some other time, friend. I really need money. Your godchild got sick. My godchild? Yeah, Melay and I had a daughter. Maynard, your ride's here. Do a good job. Call me right away. Do you have a phone number? Don't have one. What's your address here in Manila? Don't have one either... but I have a condo unit. Here. Call me at that number. Okay. Looks like you're doing very well. I'll go. You don't know how happy I am to see you again! There's lots of things to talk about. The important thing is, you're alive. You're a great actor. I can't stand the drama! I've a racket to go to! Remember to call me! - Sure thing! Hello. Who? Yes? Maynard who? Adong! It's a good thing you called. Why don't you move in with me? The landlady is nice. Really? My apartment is separate from the main house. Really? Okay, I'm on my way. She looks exactly like Melay. Same white complexion. What's her name again? Joanne. She was born on June 24. Isn't that the day you and Melay became sweethearts at the fiesta? You still remember that day? I don't know why I have such a keen memory! When was the last time you were in the province? I haven't gone home since the day I left. I miss playing with water during our town fiesta. Do you still have money? How much more do you need? Just a little more. I can borrow money from someone I know. No. Thanks for offering, but... What's the matter with you? Swallow your pride. Joanne's my godchild. We're family. I don't have the money to pay you back. Who said anything about paying me back? Thanks, Enzo. Thanks. Melay and I had a civil wedding. We stayed at her friend's house. I got jobs at the pier, a garage, in construction. I did odd jobs. When she gave birth, we rented a room. Let's go there. I didn't know she was secretly meeting her dad. But her dad couldn't accept Joanne. Melay's father made her choose. The thing is... She chose her father. Being away from Melay is okay with me. Just as long as she took Joanne with her. The bad thing is, she left me with Joanne. You were right. She couldn't stand up for me. I told you. Wait, you have something. Maya and I were neighbors there at the railroad tracks. When she was orphaned I took her in. After that, she did chores around the house and she takes care of Joanne. We moved from one squat to another. Everywhere we went our house was demolished. We ended up here. You live here? So this is your condo unit. Why don't you move in with me? I have a spare room. I live alone anyway. - Thanks, bro. Thank you. Did you hear that? We finally have a place to live. With Enzo! What? I don't want to. I'd rather stay. I'd just be a nuisance to both of you. Maya! Don't disrespect me in front of my friend! Hey! Open the door! Hope you don't mind. - It's okay, friend. Anyway, I think it's the fad. You're going? Yeah, bro. I'm leaving this hell hole behind. Is he your boyfriend? Jerk! He's my childhood friend and Joanne's godfather. Bro, how about introducing me to some of your customers? - Customers? I've learned how to give blowjobs. You're really an asshole! We're going. Hey! You big jerk! You really think you can get away that easy? Let's go. - You still owe me two weeks' rent! Let's go! Arrogant asshole! Stupid jerk! That cellphone you snatched the other day... I'm going to buy it. I'll think about it. You better think about it. You son of a bitch! You're not going to pay me after cumming so fast! There! Eat your cum! Sister, you want to score? Thanks. I need money! I don't have money. Gerry, that's impossible. What did you mean? I know you've had lots of rackets. You know me? Yes. You were my first pimp. You've been deceiving a lot of people, you faggot! I've killed him. My baby is feeling better! Kiss daddy! Give your respects to godfather Enzo! You'll stay at my place, okay? I don't want to. I'm not coming. Are you disrespecting me? You'll join us whether you like it or not! I'll just be a nuisance there! Come back here! Maya! Wow! This awesome! This is way too much! Look baby, lots of balloons! You like this, darling? I want nothing but the best for my godchild. You might spoil her. That won't happen. Don't worry. I'll look for Maya so that we can all be together. She's getting heavy! Look at the toys. Do you like balloons? Do you want me to cook dinner now, dear. Who are you calling dear, you crazy jerk? You're so cute! Come back here! Thanks for always being there for me. It's nothing. You're really something! Where are you going? Escort service. Maybe you can refer me to one of your clients. If there's an opportunity, I will. Hello? Who? Maynard? It's for you. Hello? Who is this? Paul, how are you? It's been a long time! Tomorrow? Sure! You know I can't say no to you. You're taking me shopping? Okay. Sure! Okay! Yeah, sure! Let's meet tomorrow then. Goodnight. Bye! How do you turn this thing off? Who's Paul? Do you remember the first time we met at the club? Someone introduced me to him. You gave me your card, remember? He asked for my contact number, so I gave him yours. Is that okay? What can I do? You've already given him the number. Sorry. - Next time, ask permission first. I've got to go. - Don't I get a goodbye kiss? How about this instead? I was just kidding. How about you? What do you want? Eggs? Thank you. Here. What's this for? To buy groceries. Then, pay the water and electricity bills. Save up for Joanne's education. Keep it. Okay. Nice watch. It's blinding. You like it? Paul gave it to me. Where's the party? The party? - Yeah. I think it's going to be at his friend's house. He even paid me in advance. Just so I'll attend this party. One month's earnings. I'm okay even if I don't work for a month. Hello? Yes, Paul. I'm on my way. Yeah, sure. Yes. Okay. Bye. So you already have a phone. This is high-tech. What's your number? Save my number. Well, I don't know my number. And besides, Paul will get mad if I put in anybody else's number. Need to go. Bye. Paul! Who are you? Paul? It's not funny! Paul! Motherfucker! What is this? Paul! That's nonsense! You're scaring me! Paul! Stop! Fuck you! Look, they hit him. - Adong! Animals! Carefully. What happened to you? I have been treated like an animal. You know, if only you were a woman, then you'd be my wife. Really? Yeah! It's already like we're married. The only thing missing is sex. Didn't we already have sex? You're such a jerk. Give me that! Baby, can you open the door please? Bro, why don't you guys step out for a while? I already know what you're going to say. Your father's dead and you're finally free to do whatever you want. Yes, but... You remarried... but he's sterile... You don't want to adopt. You want someone who's your own blood. Adong. You're sorry for all the things you've done... Or you want us to be together again and start a new life? There's not much time left to live, and you want to be with your daughter before you die. I just want you to know that I'm going to America. I really don't care whatever you want to do with your life. Kill yourself for all I care! I don't give a damn! I just want to make a better life for our child. Let's start a new life. Is that possible Adong? Is that possible? You went away for a long time and now you have the nerve to say that? You know, anywhere you want to go... even if you were going to the moon! Why are you like that Adong? Please forgive me. We don't need you around here! Get out, okay? What are you waiting for? Never come back, okay? Let's drink. You came home pretty late. Where's Joanne? Sleeping. She fell asleep waiting for you. I think it's time to send her to kindergarten. She's growing up fast. The other day she asked me about our jobs. I told her that we both work in an office. Have you ever thought of starting a new life? Get a different job. And do what? Janitor? Waiter? Security guard? Or a stevedore in the wet market! Maybe that suits me. Is this really what you want to do for the rest of your life? Who ever said that? Who in his right mind would want to treat his body like shit? Sometimes, we need to get hurt, before we realize our mistakes. But whatever happens in life, we still have the power to change our fate. Have you thought about that? You can still change your fate if you wanted to. Bro, you make it sound so easy. Adong, it is really easy. Don't complicate things with your life. Have you given thought to Melay's offer of moving to America? Come on, bro, let's go inside the house. Okay. I'm drunk. Let's eat! Where are the two of you going? We're going to visit Melay. Looking great! Promise to behave, okay? Okay, give godfather a kiss. Bye bye. - Bye bye. Take good care of yourselves. We have a scheduled show tomorrow. Let's practice. Think you can do that? Of course I can! Do it to me, then. It's very easy. When you're in America... don't forget me, okay? Why would I forget you? Stop being paranoid. Am I doing the right thing with your nipple? Do it harder! Let's just practice tomorrow. I don't think you're in the mood. Can you feel anything? Huh? Where? Adong, it started when we were kids... What? Why is it that my father, who had a heart of stone, felt it? I really can't understand you! Son of a bitch! What's wrong with you? Can you feel anything? Enzo, you're not gay. You just think you're gay. I don't know what I am. Listen, All I know is... there's something in my heart that beats only for you! Adong? Adong! What? I would just like to ask if you wanted to join us moving to America. No, just go without me. Is that all? I also wanted to thank you. For what? For convincing Adong. Thank you. It's nothing. I have to go. They're waiting for me. Enzo, Adong loved you too. When we eloped, he kept talking about you. I never could have him completely... because you were always there between us. The friendship that you two had, that's what keeps him strong. Melay! Take care of Adong for me. Take good care of him. If you ever hurt him again... I will kill you. Remember that, Melay. If you hurt him again I will kill you! I swear! Never hurt him again. If you ever hurt him again... I'm going to kill you. Everything will be okay. - I'll kill you, you hear? Calm down! We'll be okay. - If you hurt him... Calm down. - I'll kill you. If you hurt him... Look. Are you okay? - Yes. Are you still hoping your son will come back? Just think of it this way: that Lorenzo went abroad, made a good life for himself, and has forgotten about you. I wonder whether he misses the local sausages here, or maybe he's already eating a different kind of sausage! Stop being sentimental, Norma! It's only natural for a daughter to leave the house once she's married. Who knows? Maybe he found Adong in Manila and they're living together. Maybe they adopted children. Isn't that your dream? To have grandchildren? Do we have any food to go with liquor? Norma! I'm going out! I'll come back later. You've been out all afternoon! Pig! - Son of a bitch! I dare you to come closer! Pig! Some time ago, my son left, and never came back because of you. I'm going to make sure that someone else will leave this house... But I guarantee you, it won't be me! - You bitch! I've been a corpse in this house for far too long. A very long time! But I won't have second thoughts of returning you, to your real wife and kids, a corpse! But... the mistake I made with my son Enzo will never happen again! I'm not asking you to love me, Kadyo. I don't need you to. Just respect me as a human being. And respect me if you want to stay in my house! What? Enzo! I found Maya. She's agreed to stay with me. Tomorrow I'll pick her up at the condo. That's good news. Do you have the tickets for the flight? If we're going to do this out of pity, or gratitude... then it's better to despise me for what I am, Rather than loving that person who is not the real me. We're doing this because we need each other... so we can live, and hope... and love. Kadyo, take care of the banderitas. You might as well give them to Rita or we might be late. Don't worry about it.
