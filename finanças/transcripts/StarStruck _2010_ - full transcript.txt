Alexis Bender arrived at her birthday party last night without her leading man. Although no one saw him arrive at the fabulous club Under 21, witnesses confirm that Christopher Wilde did indeed make a secret appearance to sing for the packed house of well-wishers. Partygoers say the pop star left the club immediately following his performance, only to magically reappear at his Beverly Hills mansion several hours later with a different girl. My sources tell me this mystery girl might be stealing the heart of our favorite pop star. STOP. I WANT TO SEE THAT. WHY? IT'S ALL LIES-- TECHNICALLY, SLANDER. WHY DO YOU CARE? YOU DON'T EVEN LIKE HIM. I CARE ABOUT THE TRUTH. AND I'M PRETTY SURE THAT'S NOT IT. GIRLS, KNOCK IT OFF. I KNOW WHAT-- IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY. HERE, TAKE THE KEYS TO MY CAR AND GO TO THE BEACH. REALLY?

WOULD YOU PUT SOME SUNSCREEN ON MY BACK? HOW DID YOU KNOW IT WAS ME? THE HAT. KINDA SMELLS LIKE FISH. NO, I'M PRETTY SURE THAT'S YOU. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? GO HOME. - I TRIED. - AND? YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND. OH, SO YOU THINK YOU'RE SO SPECIAL THAT A NOBODY LIKE ME COULDN'T POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND HOW HARD IT IS TO BE YOU? OKAY. ABOUT 10 PAPARAZZI ARE PARKED OUTSIDE MY HOUSE WITH THEIR CAMERAS. OH. YEAH, THAT IS TOUGH... NOT. SEE? YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. I JUST NEED TO GET HOME IN A CAR THE PAPARAZZI WON'T RECOGNIZE.

I'M SURE OF IT." - I WAS SURE OF IT. - YOU'RE SO SURE, YOU'RE SURE OF THINGS YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY BE SURE ABOUT. - I AM NOT. - AND YOU'RE DEFENSIVE. MOVE THE CAR. WE'RE NOT MOVING. GREAT. ( shrieks ) WE'LL HAVE TO GET OUT AND PUSH. WAIT WAIT. I'LL HELP YOU. - DON'T TOUCH ME. - WHY ARE YOU SO MAD? OH, I DON'T KNOW. THIS. - TURNING ONTO THIS ROAD WAS NOT MY IDEA. - YOU'RE BLAMING ME? - YOU'RE A TERRIBLE NAVIGATOR. - YOU'RE A TERRIBLE DRIVER. - I'M A GREAT DRIVER. - RIGHT. - JESS, WE'VE GOT TO JUMP. - I'M NOT JUMPING. - YOU GOT A BETTER IDEA? - USE THE BRANCH AS A BRIDGE. - IT DOES NOT LOOK STABLE. - IT LOOKS FINE. ALL RIGHT. HERE GOES. ALL RIGHT. IT'S SINKING. GO FASTER. THIS IS MY GRANDMA'S CAR. I UNDERSTAND THAT. GIVE ME YOUR HAND. ( screams ) GRAB THE BRANCH. GRAB THE BRANCH. EXCUSE YOU. YOU KILLED PETUNIA! MY BACKPACK! DON'T JUST STAND THERE. HELP ME. - GIVE ME YOUR HAND. GIVE ME YOUR HAND. - ( phone ringing ) I'M DEAD. I'M DEAD. I'M GONNA DIE. THAT'S WHAT GONNA HAPPEN 'CAUSE MY PARENTS ARE GONNA KILL ME. WHY DID I HAVE TO GET IN THE STUPID CAR WITH YOU? - ANSWER YOUR PHONE! - OKAY. SORRY. - DAD. - SON, CAN YOU HEAR ME? WE ARE A LITTLE WORRIED OVER HERE AND-- CAN YOU HEAR ME? DAD, THERE'S NO SIGNAL. CAN YOU HEAR ME? CHRISTOPHER, COME HOME, HONEY, OKAY? OR CALL US. HELLO? HELLO. LOOK AT THIS. WHEN WE GET OUT OF HERE, YOU'RE PAYING FOR A NEW ONE. OH, I'M PAYING FOR IT RIGHT NOW. JESS. - WHAT? - WHERE ARE YOU GOING? TO THE BEACH WHERE MY SISTER IS PROBABLY FREAKING OUT RIGHT NOW. - UM, JESS. - WHAT? THE BEACH IS THAT WAY. PLEASE. ( car lock chirps ) CHRISTOPHER JOHN WILDE? COME ON. AM I BEING PUNK'D? HOW ARE YOU DOING? YOU OKAY? NOW YOU'RE CONCERNED? I'VE ALWAYS BEEN CONCERNED. - MAYBE YOU SHOULD STOP. - WHY ARE YOU SO GRUMPY? I'M NOT GRUMPY OR CRANKY OR CRABBY. I JUST WANT TO GET HOME TO MY FAMILY, EXPLAIN WHY I DISAPPEARED AND SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES. YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT? I WANT TO HAVE FUN. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS, THERE'S NO REPORTERS, NO INTERVIEWS, NO CROWDS. I'M HAVING A GREAT TIME. I WANT YOU TO STOP COMPLAINING SO I CAN ENJOY IT. WOW, SO THAT'S WHAT IT'S LIKE WITH YOU? YOU DON'T GET WHAT YOU WANT SO YOU THROW A BIG OL' TANTRUM AND WALK AWAY? I'LL BET YOUR FRIENDS CHASE AFTER YOU WHEN YOU DO THAT. "OH, CHRISTOPHER, I'M SO SORRY I HURT YOUR DELICATE LITTLE FEELINGS. CHRISTOPHER, FORGIVE ME FOR NOT TREATING YOU LIKE THE BIG ENORMOUS STAR YOU THINK YOU ARE." WHAT A BRAT. I'M A BRAT? I'M A BRAT? - WHAT ABOUT YOU? - ME? FOR THE LAST TWO DAYS I'VE DONE NOTHING BUT THINK ABOUT YOU. REALLY? SO WHEN YOU HIT ME WITH A DOOR TWICE, HID ME IN YOUR HOUSE, WRECKED MY GRANDMA'S CAR AND DROPPED ME IN MUD, YOU WERE JUST BEING THOUGHTFUL? OH, I PITY YOUR FRIENDS. YOU WISH YOU WERE ONE. I'D RATHER GO DOWN WITH PETUNIA. - I'M CONFUSED ABOUT SOMETHING. - WHAT? WHEN WE WERE ON OUR LITTLE PHOTOGRAPHY TOUR, I THOUGHT YOU LIKED ME. - YOU THOUGHT WRONG. - BUT EVERYONE LIKES ME. WHY IS IT THAT YOU DON'T LIKE ME? MAYBE BECAUSE YOU THINK EVERYBODY LIKES YOU. - BECAUSE I'M LIKEABLE. - NO, BECAUSE YOU'RE A STAR. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? YOU DON'T EVEN SEE IT, DO YOU? YOUR LIFE ISN'T REAL. YOU PARK IN NO-PARKING ZONES. YOU NEVER HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE. YOU BUY ANYTHING YOU WANT ANYTIME. YOUR HOUSE IS LIKE A HOTEL. YOU HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE WORKING FOR YOU, I'LL BET YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THEIR NAMES. - DO TOO. - NAME ONE. BOB. YOU JUST MADE THAT UP. WELL, STUBBY KNOWS EVERYBODY. THAT'S HIS JOB. SEE? THAT'S NOT NORMAL. YOUR BEST FRIEND IS YOUR DRIVER. YOUR PARENTS ARE ON YOUR PAYROLL. AND YOUR GIRLFRIEND-- I MEAN, REAL PEOPLE DATE SOMEONE BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE WITH THEM. WHY ARE YOU WITH ALEXIS? THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING. WAIT WAIT WAIT. HOLD ON, HOLD ON. HOLD ON, WAIT. STOP. ARE YOU SAYING I'M NOT A REAL PERSON? BECAUSE I AM. I STAND CORRECTED. ALL RIGHT, WHAT IF I TOLD YOU SOMETHING ABOUT ME THAT NO ONE ELSE KNOWS? YOU COLLECT YOUR TOENAILS IN A PEANUT BUTTER JAR? - NO. - THEN WHAT? FROM THE FIRST DAY I MET YOU I JUST-- - WHOA. - CHRISTOPHER! ARGH! ( laughing ) ( screams ) - I CAN'T SWIM. - OH, NO. ( laughs ) GOTCHA. YOU'RE EVIL. YOU'RE SO EVIL. THIS IS NICE, ISN'T IT? OH, MAN. I WISH I COULD STAY HERE WHERE NO ONE CAN FIND ME. WHY? THEY ALL WANT SOMETHING FROM ME-- A PERFORMANCE, AN INTERVIEW, A PHOTOGRAPH. EVEN YOUR PARENTS? THAT'S COMPLICATED. SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE THEY ONLY CARE ABOUT THE BUSINESS OF CHRISTOPHER WILDE. - I'M SURE THAT'S NOT TRUE. - I DON'T KNOW. I FEEL LIKE ALL WE TALK ABOUT RIGHT NOW IS THIS MOVIE DEAL. THEY THINK IT'S MY NEXT BIG CAREER MOVE. WHAT DO YOU THINK? I THINK IF I GET THE OFFER, I HAVE TO TAKE IT. WHAT ABOUT YOUR TOUR? WHAT ABOUT IT? WELL, 30 COUNTRIES, 12 WEEKS, ONE MILLION SCREAMING FANS. I'M NOT AN EXPERT OR ANYTHING, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT-- THE TOUR AND THE MOVIE AT THE SAME TIME. I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE. EVERYONE HAS A CHOICE. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO? WELL, I KNOW WHAT I DON'T WANT TO DO. I DON'T WANT TO DISAPPOINT ANYBODY, ESPECIALLY MY FANS. I WOULDN'T BE WHERE I AM WITHOUT THEM, SO I JUST NEVER SAY NO TO ANYTHING. - MAYBE I DON'T UNDERSTAND. - WHAT? YOUR LIFE. I MEAN, IT'S SO DIFFERENT FROM MINE. EVERYTHING YOU DO AND SAY IS SO BIG AND PUBLIC. NOT EVERYTHING. RIGHT NOW I'M HERE WITH YOU AND I FEEL LIKE I CAN JUST BE MYSELF, NOT CHRISTOPHER WILDE, NOT FAMOUS, JUST ME. HOW DO YOU LIKE IT? I LIKE IT A LOT. ME TOO. TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT YOU. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW? EVERYTHING. THAT COULD TAKE A WHILE. I LIVE A VERY EXCITING LIFE. YOU'RE DOING IT AGAIN. DOING WHAT? THAT THING WITH YOUR EYES. YOU MEAN THIS? OKAY, SO COMEDY-- NOT YOUR NEXT BIG CAREER MOVE. WHAT? NO, I'M FUNNY. FUNNY-LOOKING. YOU LIKE ME. YOU WISH. WE SHOULD GO. YEAH. COME ON. ( rap music playing ) - STUBBY? - OH, WHOA. SARA? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? OH, THAT'S NOT GOOD. ( chuckles ) WE MADE IT. YEAH. LOOK, I HAD A REALLY GREAT TIME TODAY. ME TOO. YOU'RE SO DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER GIRL I'VE EVER KNOWN. DIFFERENT WEIRD, DIFFERENT ANNOYING? DIFFERENT SURPRISING, IN THE BEST WAY. I MEAN, YOU SAY THINGS TO ME EVERYONE ELSE IS AFRAID TO SAY. AND YOU MAKE ME SEE THINGS ABOUT MYSELF THAT I CAN'T SEE. YOU'RE PRETTY SURPRISING TOO. REALLY? HOW? WELL, FOR ONE THING, YOU'RE A TERRIBLE DRIVER, WHICH IS STRANGE FOR A GUY WITH SIX CARS. I'M WOUNDED. DO YOU REALLY THINK I'M BOSSY? NO. I THINK YOU'RE AMAZING. I THINK YOU'RE AMAZING TOO. ( men laughing ) WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHOO, THAT WAS CLOSE. OKAY, BACK TO THE REAL WORLD. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT, RIGHT? NO. THIS ENDS HERE. WHAT DOES? THIS. US. YOU CAN'T TELL ANYBODY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TODAY, NOT EVEN YOUR PARENTS. WHY? THEY'RE NOT GONNA POST IT ON THEIR BLOG OR ANYTHING. LOOK, IF WE GO DOWN THERE, IF WE GET PHOTOGRAPHED TOGETHER, IT WILL GET CRAZY AND I WON'T GET THIS MOVIE DEAL. WHY DOSE IT HAVE TO GET CRAZY? BECAUSE I'M CHRISTOPHER WILDE AND YOU'RE JUST AN ORDINARY GIRL. I HAVE TO GO NOW. WAIT, JESS, JESS. WAIT WAIT, HOLD ON. WHAT JUST HAPPENED? YOU TELL ME. ONE SECOND I'M AMAZING AND THE NEXT YOU'RE EMBARRASSED TO BE SEEN WITH ME? - JESS, I'M NOT EMBARRASSED. - OH, REALLY? IF I WAS ALEXIS BENDER, YOU'D RUSH RIGHT DOWN THERE AND MAKE SURE SOMEBODY TOOK OUR PICTURE. BUT, NO, I'M JUST AN ORDINARY GIRL. THAT IS NOT WHAT I MEANT. LOOK, I-- I MEANT YOU'RE NORMAL. AND I WANT YOU TO STAY THAT WAY. RIGHT. JUST LEAVE ME ALONE. JESS, STOP, PLEASE. WHAT? THE PICTURES YOU TOOK OF US-- I SHOULD PROBABLY KEEP THEM. YOU WANT MY CAMERA? JUST IN CASE. I WOULDN'T WANT THE PICTURES TO, YOU KNOW, GET OUT. FINE. YOU WANT MY PICTURES? HERE. THERE'S NOTHING I'D WANT TO REMEMBER ANYWAY. I NEED CAB FARE TO GET HOME. I'M GOING TO HOLLYWOOD, NOT HAWAII. JUST KEEP IT. I STILL OWE YOU FOR MY STAY AT GARAGE DE LA GRANDMA. JESS, WAIT. I DON'T WANT TO SAY GOODBYE LIKE THIS. OKAY, HOW ABOUT THIS? HOW ABOUT WE BOTH FORGET THIS WHOLE DAY EVER HAPPENED? YOU WON'T TALK ABOUT ME AND I PROMISE I WON'T TALK ABOUT YOU. GO AHEAD AND JUDGE ME, BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE. THE PAPARAZZI NEVER GO AWAY. ONCE THEY HAVE YOU IN THEIR SIGHTS, THEY WON'T QUIT UNTIL THEY GET WHAT THEY WANT. AND WHEN THEY FINALLY GET IT, THEY'LL TURN IT INTO SOMETHING UGLY. THEY'LL RUIN EVERYTHING. THEY DON'T HAVE TO. YOU ALREADY DID. * YEAH * YEAH YEAH * I'M NO SUPERMAN * I CAN'T TAKE YOUR HAND * * AND FLY YOU ANYWHERE * YOU WANT TO GO * YEAH * I CAN'T READ YOUR MIND * * LIKE A BILLBOARD SIGN * AND TELL YOU EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO HEAR * * BUT I'LL BE * YOUR HERO * 'CAUSE I * I CAN BE EVERYTHING YOU NEED * * IF YOU'RE THE ONE FOR ME * * LIKE GRAVITY I'LL BE UNSTOPPABLE * * I * YEAH, I BELIEVE IN DESTINY * * I MAY BE AN ORDINARY GUY * * WITH HEART AND SOUL * BUT IF YOU'RE THE ONE FOR ME * * THEN I'LL BE A HERO * COULD YOU BE THE ONE, COULD YOU BE THE ONE * * COULD YOU BE THE ONE FOR ME?

I'LL BE A HERO * * SO INCREDIBLE * SOME KIND OF MIRACLE * WHEN IT'S MEANT TO BE * I'LL BECOME * A HERO, OH * SO I WAIT WAIT WAIT * * WAIT FOR YOU * YEAH, I'LL BE A HERO * I * I COULD BE EVERYTHING YOU NEED * * IF YOU'RE THE ONE FOR ME * * LIKE GRAVITY I'LL BE UNSTOPPABLE * * I * YEAH, I BELIEVE IN DESTINY * * I MAY BE AN ORDINARY GUY * * WITH HEART AND SOUL * BUT IF YOU'RE THE ONE FOR ME * * THEN I'LL BE A HERO * COULD YOU BE THE ONE, COULD YOU BE THE ONE * * COULD YOU BE THE ONE FOR ME? THEN I'LL BE A HERO * * COULD YOU BE THE ONE, COULD YOU BE THE ONE * * COULD YOU BE THE ONE FOR ME? THEN I'LL BE A HERO. * Man: THAT WAS GREAT, CHRIS. TAKE FIVE. THANKS, GUYS. THAT WAS GREAT. - LET'S TAKE A BREAK. - ALL RIGHT, MAN. Stubby: GOOD JOB, GUYS. YO, YOU OKAY? YEAH. I JUST CAN'T GET HER OUT OF MY MIND. YEAH, ME NEITHER. SHE CACKED ALL OVER MY SHOES. SHE'S REAL, YOU KNOW? SHE'S ANNOYINGLY HONEST. SHE'S SMART. SHE'S COOL. SHE'S FUNNY. SHE'S BEAUTIFUL. AHEM. HELLO, BOYS. TALKING ABOUT ME? DUDE. LOOK, ALEXIS, I CAN EXPLAIN-- I DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHO SHE IS. IS SHE AN ACTRESS? IS SHE MORE FAMOUS THAN ME? NO, SHE'S NOT AN ACTRESS. SHE'S NOT FAMOUS AT ALL. - THEN I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WOULD PICK HER. - ( phone ringing ) I DIDN'T PICK HER. IT JUST HAPPENED. SILLY, THAT KIND OF STUFF ONLY HAPPENS IN THE MOVIES. THIS IS THE REAL WORLD. OH, I HAVE A DATE WITH ZACH. I HAVE TO GO. WAIT, ARE YOU BREAKING UP WITH ME? UH-HUH. OKAY. FRIENDS? SURE. BYE, GRANDMA. I LOVE YOU. GOODBYE, SARA. LOVE YOU MORE. YOU'RE SURE YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY, MOM? YES, BARBARA. AND YOU MUSTN'T BELIEVE WHAT YOU READ ABOUT OLD FOLKS. HOWARD AND I ARE GOING TO BE JUST FINE. I CAN SEE THAT. LOVE YOU. LOVE YOU. LOVE YOU. HOW ABOUT YOU, JESSIE? ARE YOU GONNA BE ALL RIGHT? OH, SWEETHEART. I KNOW IT HURTS RIGHT NOW, BUT THINGS ARE NOT ALWAYS WHAT THEY SEEM IN THE MOMENT. GIVEN SOME TIME, LIFE HAS A WAY OF WORKING ITSELF OUT FOR THE BETTER. - REALLY, GRANDMA? - YUP. I MEAN, LOOK AT ME. I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET RID OF THAT UGLY OLD CAR SINCE YOUR GRANDPA DIED. OH, HONEY. - I LOVE YOU, GRANDMA. - I LOVE YOU, SWEETHEART. - BYE, HOWARD. - TAKE CARE, SWEETHEART. YOU TOO. - BYE-BYE. - BYE. BYE, EVERYBODY. JESSICA OLSON-- SUCH A NICE NAME FOR A NICE GIRL. - WHERE DID YOU GET THAT? - WHERE DO YOU THINK I GOT IT, CHRISTOPHER? LIBBY LAM HAD A WHOLE FLEET OF PHOTOGRAPHERS ON YOU FOR THE PAST TWO DAYS. I KNOW. BUT I WAS SO CAREFUL. THIS IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF THING I WAS AFRAID OF WITH YOU, KID. YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY NOT SERIOUS ABOUT DOING THIS MOVIE. MAYBE YOU'RE JUST TOO YOUNG. NO, SIR. LOOK, I MADE A MISTAKE. COME ON, ALAN. GIVE US A CHANCE TO FIX THIS. ( sighs ) ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. MAKE THE STORY GO AWAY. - Daniel: HOW DO WE DO THAT? - YOU CALL LIBBY LAM. YOU OFFER HER AN EXCLUSIVE, SAY YOU DON'T KNOW THIS GIRL. YOU SAY SHE'S JUST SOME FAN WHO WAS FOLLOWING YOU AROUND ALL DAY. YOU WANT ME TO LIE? CHRISTOPHER, THIS IS THE TABLOID PRESS, DUDE, NOT THE SUPREME COURT. SAY WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO SAY BECAUSE, I PROMISE YOU, EITHER THIS GIRL GOES AWAY OR THE MOVIE DOES. OKAY? GOODBYE. Libby Lam: WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS GIRL-- JESSICA OLSON. YEAH, SHE LOOKS KIND OF FAMILIAR. COME ON, CHRISTOPHER. WE KNOW YOU WERE AT THE BEACH WITH HER. LOOK, LOTS OF FANS COME TO MALIBU TO WATCH ME SURF. I TRY TO SAY HI TO EVERYBODY THAT COMES UP TO ME. MAYBE I SIGNED AN AUTOGRAPH FOR HER OR SOMETHING. Dean: EXCUSE US. IT'S OKAY. Libby Lam: ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCES, SHE CAME ALL THE WAY FROM KALAMAZOO, MICHIGAN, JUST TO SEE YOU. WOW, REALLY? I'M SORRY I DIDN'T GET THE CHANCE TO MEET HER. YOU HAVE TO TALK TO US, JESS. WHAT HAPPENED OUT THERE IN CALIFORNIA? NOTHING BAD, I PROMISE. I CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT. PLEASE JUST TRUST ME. CHRISTOPHER WILDE'S TALKING ABOUT YOU ON "STARSTRUCK." So you're saying that you don't know this girl. Yeah. I mean, I don't know what she's saying about me, but I don't know anybody named Jessica Olson. Sorry, Libby. There's nothing more to tell. Okay. You heard it here first. I'm Libby Lam. This is "Starstruck News." I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'RE STILL OUT THERE. WHY DON'T THEY JUST DO HOME? BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T GOT WHAT THEY CAME FOR YET. YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD JUST GO TALK TO THEM. I MEAN, YOU'RE ALREADY ALL OVER THE INTERNET. I AM? YEAH. THERE'S LIKE A WHOLE WEB SITE DEVOTED TO WHAT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT "CHRISSICA." CHRISSICA? MM-HMM. ( keyboarding ) WOW. YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T READ ANY OF THESE. OH, HEY, WAIT. HERE'S A GOOD ONE. MM-HMM. "THAT JESSICA OLSON CHICK IS A REAL NUT, DUDE. "SHE JUST WANTS TO BE FAMOUS. SHE SHOULD GET A LIFE BECAUSE SHE--" GUYS, STOP. JUST STOP. MAYBE IT'S THE PHRASING OR THE TEMPO. SOMETHING'S... SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT. YO, WHAT'S UP WITH YOU, MAN? I DON'T KNOW. YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT I THINK? SURE YOU DO. I THINK YOU'RE STILL TORN UP ABOUT JESSICA. NO. NO, I'M GOOD. I'M OVER HER. * ALL MY LIFE, PEOPLE SAID WHO I MEET IS WHO I AM * * THEY DON'T WANT TO KNOW * THEY DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND * * TOO MANY PEOPLE * TRYIN' TO TELL ME TO BE PRACTICAL * * ONLY THINK THAT I AM ONE-DIMENSIONAL * * BUT I CAN FEEL IT * THERE'S A FIRE RAGING UNDERNEATH * * BURNING THROUGH THE PAGES, HERE I AM, COMING CLEAN * * I'M SICK OF LYING TO MYSELF, GOT TO LIVE IT TRUE * * NOW I GOT TO DO WHAT I GOT TO DO * * THIS IS WHERE I SHOULD BE * THERE AIN'T NO OTHER PLACE, YEAH * * WHERE MY SOUL REALLY SPEAKS * * THERE AIN'T NO OTHER WAY I CAN FEEL IT SAVE ME * * MOVE ME, SHAME ME * GOT TO GO WHERE THE MUSIC TAKES ME * * LET IT SET ME FREE * YOU GOT TO BELIEVE * IS IT A CRIME TO JUST BE WHO I WANT TO BE? * * I NEED SOME SPACE SO THAT I CAN CHASE ALL MY DREAMS * * 'CAUSE WHEN I HIT THE STAGE, ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE * * I GET LOST IN THE SONG, AND THAT IS MAGICAL * * SO CRANK IT UP, FEEL THE RUSH * * AND JUST TURN ME LOOSE * I WANT TO FEEL THE INSPIRATION * * THAT IS COMING THROUGH * AND THERE'S NO OTHER PLACE * WHERE I FEEL SO ALIVE * IS WHEN I START TO SING * YOU JUST CAN'T DENY * THIS IS WHERE I SHOULD BE * THERE AIN'T NO OTHER PLACE, YEAH * * WHERE MY SOUL REALLY SPEAKS * * THERE AIN'T NO OTHER WAY I CAN FEEL IT SAVE ME * * MOVE ME, SHAME ME * GOT TO GO WHERE THE MUSIC TAKES ME * * LET IT SET ME FREE * YOU GOT TO BELIEVE * WHEN EVERYBODY'S GONE * AND I'M HERE ALL ALONE * I DON'T GOT TO HIDE * I DON'T GOT TO CRY * YOU GOT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS WHO I AM * * AND IT'S WHERE I SHINE * AND IT'S WHERE I SHINE * I KNOW THIS IS WHERE I SHOULD BE * * THERE AIN'T NO OTHER PLACE, YEAH * * WHERE MY SOUL REALLY SPEAKS * * THERE AIN'T NO OTHER WAY I CAN FEEL IT SAVE ME * * MOVE ME, SHAME ME * GOT TO GO WHERE THE MUSIC TAKES ME * * LET IT SET ME FREE * YOU GOT TO BELIEVE * THIS IS WHERE I SHOULD BE * THERE AIN'T NO OTHER PLACE, YEAH * * WHERE MY SOUL REALLY SPEAKS * * THERE AIN'T NO OTHER WAY I CAN FEEL IT * * MOVE ME * GOT TO GO WHERE THE MUSIC TAKES ME * * LET IT SET ME FREE * LET IT SET ME FREE * LET IT SET ME FREE * YOU GOT TO BELIEVE ( applause ) YOU ARE DEFINITELY NOT OVER HER. ( sighs ) OKAY, THEY NEED TO GO NOW. I THOUGHT YOU LIKED BEING ON TV. YEAH, BUT I NEED TO BUY A DRESS FOR THE DANCE AND THEY'RE BLOCKING MY CAR. CHRISTOPHER SAID THIS WOULD HAPPEN. HE SAID IT WOULD GET CRAZY. CELEBRITIES MIGHT HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THIS, BUT I DON'T. JESSICA, JESSICA, TELL US ABOUT YOUR WEEKEND WITH CHRISTOPHER WILDE. WE ONLY WANT THE TRUTH. YOU DON'T WANT THE TRUTH. YOU WANT A STORY. YOU TAKE A GOOD, NORMAL PERSON AND TURN HIM INTO YOUR OWN LITTLE REALITY SHOW. YOU BUILD HIM UP INTO A BIG CELEBRITY JUST SO YOU CAN TEAR HIM DOWN IN PUBLIC, JUST SO YOU CAN SELL MAGAZINES AND TV SHOWS. THAT'S REALLY SICK. AND CHRISTOPHER WILDE IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE. HE'S TALENTED AND SUCCESSFUL. HE HAS ALL THE STUFF LOTS OF KIDS DREAM OF HAVING. BUT THANKS TO YOU, HE'S HAD TO GIVE UP SOME OF THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE-- FREEDOM, PRIVACY, HONESTY. SO CONGRATULATIONS. YOU'VE CREATED A CELEBRITY BUT YOU HAVE WRECKED THE HUMAN BEING INSIDE. YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES. DID YOU GET THAT? JESSICA, JESSICA, JUST ONE MORE QUESTION. IN YOUR OPINION, WHO IS CHRISTOPHER WILDE REALLY? WHO IS HE? I DON'T KNOW. THE CHRISTOPHER WILDE YOU'RE ALL SO OBSESSED WITH-- I promise you, I've never met him and I wouldn't want to. DIDN'T YOU SAY YOU LIKED HER BECAUSE SHE WAS SO HONEST? YEAH. WOW. CONGRATULATIONS, CHRIS. YOU DID IT. - YOU GOT HER TO LIE FOR YOU. - I DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE, OKAY? OH. ALL RIGHT. - WHERE ARE YOU GOING? - TO FIND MY BEST FRIEND, 'CAUSE HE'S NOT THE GUY SITTING HERE NOW. DUDE, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? "I DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE." LATELY THAT'S BEEN YOUR ANSWER TO EVERYTHING, MAN. REALLY? YEAH. YOUR LIFE-- YOUR CHOICE, MAN. WHAT DO YOU WANT? ( thunder crashing ) - Man: CUT! - ( bell rings ) GUYS, YOU NAILED IT. PERFECT, GUYS. THAT WAS THE ONE. THAT WAS PERFECT. LET'S GO ONE MORE TIME. SIR, A GREAT TAKE. CHRISTOPHER! BUDDY, GREAT NEWS-- YOU'RE IN. REHEARSALS START ON MONDAY. ACTUALLY, I'M NOT AVAILABLE. NOT A PROBLEM. WE'LL CHANGE THE DATE. NO, I CAME TO SAY THANKS FOR THE OFFER, BUT IF I HAVE TO LIE TO GET INTO YOUR LITTLE CLUB, I THINK I'LL PASS. WOW. THE KID'S GOT EDGE, FIRE. I LIKE THAT. - ( bell rings ) - AND CUE THE RAIN. HE HAS TWO WEEKS BETWEEN OSLO AND LONDON. WE COULD MAKE HIM AVAILABLE FOR THE MOVIE THEN. THAT'S TIGHT. HE NEEDS SOME DOWN TIME. OKAY. OOH OOH, ALL RIGHT. HOW ABOUT AFTER TOKYO BUT BEFORE MELBOURNE? WHAT'S GOING ON? - HI, HONEY. - HEY. WE'RE WORKING THE MOVIE INTO YOUR TOUR SCHEDULE. OH. I DON'T WANT TO DO THE MOVIE ANYMORE. SWEETIE, DON'T BE SILLY. OF COURSE YOU DO. WE'RE ABOUT TO MAKE THE DEAL, BUD. WELL, IT'S TOO LATE. I'VE ALREADY PASSED. HONEY, THAT'S NOT YOUR DECISION. YES, IT IS. I'M 17 YEARS OLD. I JUST WANT TO HAVE FUN AND MAKE MUSIC. OKAY OKAY. HEY, NO WORRIES. WE'LL HANDLE IT. NO. NO, IT'S TIME THAT I START MANAGING MY OWN LIFE. SO... YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE FIRED. I'D REALLY LIKE YOU TO JUST BE MY PARENTS FROM NOW ON. OKAY, COME HERE. TURN. IT'S JUST NOT GIRLIE ENOUGH. BUT IMAGINE IT ON ME. GIRLIER, RIGHT? HMM, MAYBE. WHY DON'T YOU JUST TRY IT ON YOURSELF? STOP WHINING. HERE, WE HAVE THREE HOURS BEFORE THE DANCE. GO CHANGE. KIDS. SO WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO HAVE REPORTERS ON YOUR LAWN? EXCITING, BUT I NEED MY PRIVACY TOO. WE ALL WATCHED YOUR SISTER ON TV. AND SHE LOOKED WACKO. REALLY? YEAH, IT WAS SO WEIRD THE WAY SHE MADE UP THAT STORY ABOUT MEETING CHRISTOPHER WILDE. SHE IS SO PATHETIC. OOPS. DO YOU THINK SHE HEARD THAT? A.J., YOU'RE AN IDIOT. - WHAT? - GET OUT. - BUT-- - GO. JESSICA. GO AWAY. NO, I ACTUALLY LIVE HERE. WHAT? GO WITH ME TO THE DANCE. I THOUGHT I WAS PATHETIC AND EMBARRASSING. ONLY IF YOU ACTUALLY DANCE. SO DON'T. COME ON. COME ON, LET'S MAKE YOU PRETTY ENOUGH TO BE MY SISTER. ( pop song playing ) YOU LOOK GOOD. DON'T SLOUCH. YOU KNOW, SARA, IN A WEIRD WAY, YOU'RE A GOOD SISTER. OH. PRETEND YOU DON'T KNOW ME. ( girls giggling ) LAME. ( music stops ) ( girls screaming ) JESSICA OLSON? THERE ARE SOME THINGS I FORGOT TO SAY TO YOU BACK IN CALIFORNIA. ( crowd oohs ) ( ballad playing ) * CAN'T BLAME YOU * FOR THINKING * THAT YOU NEVER REALLY KNEW ME AT ALL * * I TRIED TO * DENY YOU * BUT NOTHING EVER MADE ME FEEL SO WRONG * * I THOUGHT I WAS PROTECTING YOU * * FROM EVERYTHING THAT I GO THROUGH * * BUT I KNOW THAT WE GOT LOST * * ALONG THE WAY * HERE I AM * WITH ALL MY HEART * I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND * * I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND * I KNOW I LET YOU DOWN * * BUT I'M NEVER * GONNA MAKE THAT MISTAKE AGAIN * * YOU BROUGHT ME CLOSER * * TO WHO I REALLY AM * SO COME TAKE MY HAND * * I WANT THE WORLD TO SEE * * WHAT YOU MEAN TO ME * WHAT YOU MEAN TO ME. WHAT DID YOU THINK? THAT YOU COULD JUST COME HERE AND SING TO ME AND EVERYTHING WOULD BE FINE? UM, YES. NO? NO NO. WELL, WHICH IS IT? I JUST CAME TO TELL YOU I WAS WRONG ABOUT EVERYTHING, ESPECIALLY ABOUT YOU. DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE A LITTLE LATE? EVERYONE HERE THINKS I WAS LYING. I'M THE ONE WHO LIED. I LIED ABOUT KNOWING JESSICA OLSON. THE TRUTH IS I KNOW JESSICA OLSON. JESSICA OLSON IS A TERRIBLE NAVIGATOR AND A KNOW-IT-ALL, BUT SHE'S HONEST. WHEN SHE MAKES A PROMISE, SHE KEEPS IT. SHE UNDERSTANDS ME LIKE NO ONE ELSE DOES. AND I'M CRAZY ABOUT HER. JESSICA, I'M SO SORRY. I KNOW THAT I HURT YOU AND I'LL NEVER DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT AGAIN. JUST PLEASE FORGIVE ME. Crowd: AWW. ( applause ) - GO AWAY, NOW. - OH, OKAY. GET OUT OF HERE. MOVE IT. ( dance music playing ) ( clears throat ) CHRISTOPHER, THIS IS MY SISTER SARA. SARA, THIS IS CHRISTOPHER WILDE. SARA, YOU WANNA DANCE WITH ME? UH-HUH. I THINK I GOT THIS ONE, CHRISSY. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO COME ALL THE WAY TO MICHIGAN FOR THIS. YEAH, I DID. IT'S NOT COOL TO ASK A GIRL OUT ON THE PHONE. SO...
