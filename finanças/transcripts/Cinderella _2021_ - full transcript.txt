Once upon a time, there was an old-fashioned kingdom, bound by tradition. Here, everyone had a part to play, and they played it without question. Little did they know, their world was about to change. But until it did, y'all... this village of hardworking citizens moved to the same beat, day after day, generation after generation. Rhythm Rhythm Rhythm nation Rhythm Rhythm Rhythm nation People of the world today Are we looking for a better way of life? Sing. We are a part of the rhythm nation We are a part of the rhythm nation And over here is where our story begins, at the humble home of a practical woman named Vivian, who was alone again after the death of her second husband. Looking for a better way of life Vivian's daughters, the obnoxious Malvolia, and the self-absorbed Narissa. She cray. We are a part We are a part We are a part of the rhythm nation Sure. Yeah, they can be a lot. I'm winning. And down here, in this dingy basement, the stepdaughter, Ella. Or as her stepsisters call her, Cinderella, because her skin was often besmirched by cinders, and her stepsisters were not that clever. Right now she's dreaming of a world in which she can live her life any way she wants. Watch it now. You about to roll over on that... pin.

Imagine if you served such swill to your future husband. How long would it take for him to abandon you? To understand just how worthless you are? Learn from this and never do it again. - She was rather hard on her. - She could have gone harder. Quiet. Cinderella, now that you're an orphan, it's important for you to remember that only my love for your father, rest his soul, stands between you and a life on the street. Yes, of course. And that's why I'm so thankful... You could be so pretty, if you took even a second to comb that hair of yours. You're in. Good morning, Ella. Mr. Cecil. It's Mr. Cecil. I'm curious. Do you really need that cane? No, but chicks dig it. - Vivian. - Thomas. And all the girls. Lucky Thomas. There they go. Freshly picked from the farm. Parsnips, turnips, rutabagas. The fleshiest fruit of the earth. - Would you like to come in? - Yes. No. No, no, not today. I just wanted to check in on you. And make sure that your blossoming daughters are... managing. - Makes my skin crawl. - Mine too. - I'm into it. - All right. Now I've got this mental image to nourish me through the day, I'll be going. Fortune has smiled upon this house. My daughters have a suitor. This daughter has a suitor. The others have heartache and jealousy. Yeah, no, I am not a match for Thomas. Well, you must make yourself a match for someone. Yes. I understand, Stepmother. - Here comes our girl. - She's got heavy feet. I slept in that fabric. Here I go again I'm imagining a world outside Unlike the one I'm in Daydreaming again Of when I'll get a chance There's a world that understands Where you don't hear the whispers In the room you're walking in Daydreaming again All I need is a chance When I feel my fear staring at me I tell it, "Just wait and see" I know who I'm gonna be I know who I'm gonna be The world's half asleep It's gonna wake up and see Nice. If it's a million-to-one I'm gonna be that one And if it's a shot in the dark I'm gonna be the sun And I just can't afford to be wrong Even when I'm afraid You're gonna know my name Yeah, you're gonna know my name I can barely sleep 'Cause my heart is always racing Chasing Pacing 'round the room Living carefully Is something I don't wanna do When I feel my fear staring at me I tell it, "Just wait and see" I know who I'm gonna be I know who I'm gonna be The world's half asleep It's gonna wake up and see If it's a million-to-one I'm gonna be that one And if it's a shot in the dark I'm gonna be the sun And I just can't afford to be wrong Even when I'm afraid You're gonna know my name Yeah, you're gonna know my name And I can see her now and then The one I know that I could be Yeah I see her laughing 'Cause she knew all along in her head So when the light is hard to see She's telling me If it's a million-to-one I'm gonna be that one And if it's a shot in the dark I'm gonna be the sun - And I just can't afford to be wrong - No, no, no Even when I'm afraid Not even when I'm afraid You're gonna know my name You're gonna know my name You're gonna know my name You're gonna know my name Yeah You're gonna know my name You're gonna know my name God. That's disgusting. - Thank you for coming in... - Before your aide-de-camp loses a hand... This is called a world map. Now take a look at this blob here and here. If we marry, our blobs would join up, and we would control the world all the way to this huge sea monster. The sea monster. I really don't have time in my schedule to be controlling these far-off lands. I am just too busy. Doing what? You spent three whole days drinking and fox hunting. That was hard work. Try tracking a fox when drunk. It's impossible. No, it isn't. You didn't. Do not hit me, sweet prince. No, no, no. I promise, milord, you can keep gallivanting here with your merry bros, and I'll have other interests. We never have to be together, except for royal events, war-planning, and when we have to engage in the disgusting practice of making a son. Your offer is intriguing, but I have no intention on settling down any time soon. I see. He's not working with much upstairs and I'd be surprised if it was different elsewhere. She knows what I'm talking about. Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye Hey, hear ye I'm the new town crier Yeah, I took over from Barry I know we all miss him But he died of dysentery So now I'm here With the announcements of the day Got my band beside me I know you like the way they play Today we got news For you ladies and gents A changing of the guard ls soon gonna commence But this one is special Better than the shire fair 'Cause this time The whole royal family will be there Yeah King Rowan, of course And our Queen Beatrice In their fancy royal robes You don't wanna miss Prince Robert with the hair Princess Gwen, no doubt See the new guards come in And the old roll out Yeah Are they rosy yet? The pain is quite terrific. Ladies, are we ready? What in God's name are you doing? Bringing color to her cheeks. Good idea. - Where's Cinderella? - Still in that basement. Cinderella! I'm starting to think she doesn't like us. Cinderella. Girls, can you help me? Cinderella! - Cinderella! - Cinderella! Cinderella! Cinderella! You called? Yes, stepchild. Don't be dense. - I'm sorry, I was just... - About to make an excuse? I could truly care less. Grab your things, try not to make us late. The changing of the guard waits for no one. Cinderella? Yeah? Do you think I look pretty? I think you look so pretty. But, honestly, who cares what I think? Who cares what anyone thinks? What matters is how you feel when you look in the mirror. That's deep. How do I feel about myself? Yeah, I do. I feel pretty. Cool. You have dirt on your face. Please, girls, we're going to be late. What is that? It's a dress. I made it. - Why? - I don't know. I just thought since the whole kingdom will be there today, I could find someone who will maybe buy it. To think that any girl, let alone you, would have the audacity to engage in matters of business? It's insane. I will not have you embarrassing this household with your blasphemy. Don't ever let me catch you trying such nonsense again. Put the dress down. Yes, Stepmother. Good. Now... Shoulders back. No slouching. And smile. Every girl is worth more when she smiles. What are you doing? I am stewing in my own anger. Okay. You turned down the daughter of Lord Reginald? - I guess she wasn't the one. - She was. I would have control of all the territories up to the domain of the sea monster. Perhaps you should marry the sea monster, Robert. I'd have to have Grandmother's ring resized. You keep overlooking his behavior, and he'll never grow out of it. Stop. He will make a fine king. Is it me, or is your throne just a little bit taller than it was yesterday? It really looks... Don't be ridiculous. Even if it is, I have every right to make it taller. I'm king. Yes. And I am ridiculous. If you need me, I shall be in my chambers, brushing my hair, until it all falls out. So we good? Because I got a thing. You're bringing shame on this family, Robert. Have you seen this? "The Roundabout Players present The King's Idiot Son." Can we still get tickets? I'm becoming a laughingstock. You're overreacting. Ask the Roundabout Players if I'm overreacting. They are currently in a dark, windowless room under the castle. You can't leave actors alone in a basement without attention. They'll die. When you marry, you'll settle down. You'll stop behaving like my idiot son. The perception of the people will be that you take the crown seriously. You can't control me. That's exactly what I can do. That's the perk of being the king. I feel nothing for these women. It's crazy to think I'll fall in love with one. Kings marry for power, not for love. It's perfect, then, that Mother came with three castles and 100 horses, or I never would've been born. Silence! Don't talk about what you don't understand. Continue to defy me, and just out of spite, I'll give it all, the crown, the palace, everything, to your sister. Leave us, Gwen. Sorry. I would be embarrassed if I wasn't so bored with my life. But since I'm here, I'd love to stay and help sort out this whole crown issue. - You've been excused, Gwen. - Right. But is this a good time to mention how the kingdom could use the power of wind? - Instead of burning filthy coal? - Go. Father, you know how badly I want to be king. I do. Now, to make sure your nuptials are done properly and on my schedule, we shall hold a ball. - A ball? - No. Balls are fun Yes. We'll invite every woman of worth. You'll dance. You'll be charming. You shall find a bride. No, no, no. Dancing at these things is so mannered and formal. We look like fools. Of course, we do. But women love it. Good God, Robert. If a rich man ever lost a woman, it was to a man who could dance. Why do I have to explain everything to you? This is insane. I can't just pick some bride at a ball. Then what? We're supposed to grow old together? Into our 40s? I mean, what are we even gonna talk about? You will go to the ball. You will find someone. That's an order. Now go dress. I expect you to look sharp for the changing of the guard. Nothing? A ball was a good idea Don't be late. "Don't be late." Well, you heard the king. Can anybody Find me Somebody to... Love? Each morning I get up I die a little Can barely stand on my feet - Take a look at yourself in the mirror - Take a look in the mirror and cry - And cry - Lord, what you're doing to me Yeah I have spent all my years in believing you But I just can't get no relief Lord. - Somebody - Somebody - Somebody - Somebody Can anybody find me Somebody to love? - I work hard - He works hard Every day of my life I work till I ache in my bones But at the end of the day I'm all on my own I get down on my knees And I start to pray Till the tears run down from my eyes Lord - Somebody, somebody - Somebody, somebody Can anybody find me Somebody to love? - I work hard - He works hard - Every day of my life - Every day I try and I try and I try But everybody wants to put me down They say I'm going crazy They say I got a lot of water in my brain I got no common sense I got nobody left to believe Find me somebody to love Find me somebody to love - Find me somebody to love - Find me somebody - Find me somebody to love - Find me somebody - Find me somebody to love - Find me somebody - Find me somebody to love - Find me somebody - Find me somebody to love - Find me somebody Love, love Love, love - Somebody - Somebody - Somebody - Somebody - Somebody - Anyone - Dude. - Anybody Can anybody find me Somebody to...? Get off my dad. Good. Everyone's staring at me, just as I'd hoped. I'm sorry, Your Highness. It's just really hard to see in the back. Might I suggest you put some bleachers back there? Give us short peasants a chance? I hereby decree all short peasants shall be pardoned by the king. Get down now. He doesn't... He didn't think that was funny, did he? Bird poo. To love? Find me Find me Find me Somebody Excuse me, sorry. Find me Find me Find me Somebody Somebody Find me Find me Find me Someone to Find me Find me Find me Someone to Love I'll play your silly game, but only if every girl in the kingdom is invited to the ball, regardless of wealth or stature. Marrying a commoner is not at all what I meant. Father, please. Deep down, you need me to be king. What a black mark it'll be on your name if I don't continue the line. What option do you have? Too subtle? Not subtle enough? Fine. So it shall be. Don't even think about it, Gwen. You're literally not even going to let me have a seat at the table? I don't make up the rules. I'm just the king. Right. So you're going to wander about until you find her, wearing that ridiculous disguise? It works, Wilbur. - Nobody recognizes me. - Lucky for you. No, too much. - The makeup? - You look like a pirate. You look like a pirate. Unnecessary. I can't believe you're willing to sully the dignity of the royal family for some commoner. You sound old. - I'm just... - What? She's beautiful. She's witty. She's fearless. Did you see how she talked to my father? So mouthy. Glorious. I must know her. I'll walk the streets until I find her, reveal my true self, then personally invite her to the ball. Unless it turns out that she's got a couple bats in the old belfry, in which case I will realize that my feelings were incorrect, and... slowly back away. - It is your belfry that has bats. - I do not have a single bat in my belfry. - There are multiple bats in your belfry. - I am the prince. I say that your belfry is the one with the bats. I'm the prince's best friend. I say that yours is one with the bats. I'm your best friend, right? I have lots of friends. - Of course, you're my best friend. - Thought so. Beautiful human. Bats. Look at that. It's a good thing Stepmother never comes down here. She does not approve of pets, or charity, or kindness of any sort, really. She'd definitely stop you from doing whatever it is you're doing now, which is beautiful. And only a little bit gross. - A little bit? It's revolting. - She needs to throw that out. I don't mind it. All right, wish me luck... because life outside this basement... starts right now. Girls, it shouldn't be so hard. But it is. Work is always hard. Why are we doing Cinderella work? To see what you're in for if you don't marry a man of means, like Thomas. Thomas. He's quite the catch. Too bad he hasn't been back in days. If it's not Thomas, it will have to be some other man. Like him? No, no, no. Do not cast your eyes on some farm boy. In this life, you must marry rich. Get yourself a man who can pay for everything. Then you will never have to hang your wet undergarments again. - I'm gonna go see if he needs a wife. - No. Farm boy is off the table. No matter how toothsome he may be. And... toothsome he is. - What does that mean? - It's how old people say "popping." You must always think and act like this. Some boys kiss me Some boys hug me I think they're okay If they don't give me proper credit I just walk away They can beg And they can plead - But they can't see the light - That's right 'Cause the boy With the cold hard cash Is always Mr. Right 'Cause we are living In a material world And I am a material girl You know that we are living In a material world And I am a material girl But what about romance? Please. Listen up. Some boys romance Some boys slow dance That's all right with me If they can't raise my interest Then I have to let them be Some boys try and some boys lie But I don't let them play No way Only boys Who save their pennies Make my rainy day 'Cause they are living In a material world And I am a material girl - Get it? - Yes. We are living in a material world And I am a material girl 'Cause everybody's living In a material world And I am a material girl 'Cause we are living In a material world And I am a material girl - You know - Material I am a material girl Living in a material world - Material - Living in a material Living in a material world - Material - Living in a ma... Material world "And sons." "And sons." Lovely day for a stroll. I just adore your headpiece. It'd go beautifully with this dress I made. - I can give you a fair price. - Shame on you. Trying to sell me a dress you clearly stole from the lady you serve. I stitched this with my own two hands. I should alert the king's guard and have you arrested, you street urchin. Arrested? Okay. Ladies and gentlemen. For a mere five pieces of silver, who would like to purchase this one-of-a-kind, completely non-stolen dress? Here's a laugh. This girl fancies herself a businessman. Don't listen to him. This is a one-of-a-kind design. Stop while you're ahead. - Who on earth do you think you are? - Honestly. But... Sounds like you need to lower your price. Sir, please, don't pile on. Okay? Not today. I'm sorry. It's a beautiful dress. Right? I should be allowed to sell it. Sure, but women can't own shops. - And that's unfair. - Is it? Yes. Us ladies give birth. We run households. Surely we can run a business. Can't be that hard. Wouldn't it just be great if I could have my own shop? Right here. I could hang my garments on that side. And I'd say things like, "Thank you. Come again." Or, "Hot enough out there for you?" - What? - It's banter. It breaks the ice. What am I doing? I'm going home. Talking to a stranger. - I'll take it. - Take what? The dress. I'll buy it. Is this pity? Are you doing this because you feel sorry for me? That's really nice, but... No. I'm just trying to do my part to correct a flawed system. What's your price? The brooch alone... The brooch. That was my mother's. I never knew her, but I wanna believe she'd rather me have my dreams than her brooch. I'll pay triple what you're asking. You? Don't judge a book by its cover, milady. Hey Yeah Gather 'round Heed my call In two weeks hence There'll be a ball Not just any ball It could change your life See, it's time the prince Finally find his wife All the single ladies Should be getting excited Because every single one To the ball is invited So take a bath Do your hair Buy a fancy new dress Paint your nails You got a prince to impress Yes It's gonna be magic, yo So it'd be tragic, y'all If you were a sad chick, yo And thought yourself underqualified No So put on a gown, y'all For a shot at the crown, yo And prepare to get down, y'all As Prince Robert Chooses his bride Prince Robert needs a ball to find his bride? What is wrong with him? Maybe nothing's wrong with him. I heard he just wants to allow anyone the chance to fall in love with him. How conceited is that? Rumors must be true. What, pray tell, are the rumors? He serves no real function, other than to wreck things. That the real brains of the family is Princess Gwen, duh. And that he's a mama's boy who I heard from time to time still gets spanked on the tush-tush. - Not true at all, though. - Maybe. Sounds like a vicious lie. Does this mean you're not coming to the ball? No way. The whole thing is weird and antiquated. Not my thing. Nice to meet you. You know, we live in a very old-fashioned kingdom. But the ball, I mean, there'll be guests there from all over the world. Open-minded people with cash to spare. I know them. I can introduce you, if you like. Why would you do that? I mean, you just met me. Let's just say, I know what it feels like to not quite fit into the crate you were born into. And I believe in you. Then, yes. I'll go. Huzzah. What? I heard a proper person say that when he was excited. Look who's been around a proper person. Just once. I once shared an apple with a goat named King Rowan. I'm sure the prince will definitely pick you. I doubt it. I'm dirty. I smell like a basement. My friends are mice. It's a whole thing. I will just find you at the ball. Thank you for this. You're welcome. Hope the dress fits. - Gonna try it on as soon as I get home. - Okay. He's kind of cute. Give me your finest fabrics, please. Yes. This is it. This is my chance. Am I wrong For thinking out the box From where I stay? Am I wrong For saying that I'll choose another way? I ain't trying to do What everybody else doing Just 'cause everybody Doing what they all do If one thing I know How far would I grow? I'm walking down this road of mine This road that I call home So am I wrong For thinking that We could be something for real? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah - No, no, no, no, that's wrong Now, am I wrong For trying to reach The things that I can't see? - That's just how I feel - That's just how I feel That's just how I feel - That's just how I feel - That's just how I feel Trying to reach The things that I can't see Am I tripping? Am I? For having a vision? My prediction I'mma be on the top of the world - In your dreams. - In your face. Girls, please. I assure you, Robert will cease to be a distraction. Hope you Hope you don't look back Always do what you decide Don't let them control your life That's just how I feel Fight for yours And don't let go Don't let them compare you No Don't worry You're not alone That's just how I feel That's just how we feel That's just how I feel If you tell me I'm wrong Wrong I don't wanna be right Right If you tell me I'm wrong Wrong I don't wanna be right I don't wanna be right If you tell me I'm wrong Wrong If you tell me I'm wrong I don't wanna be right Right If you tell me I'm wrong Wrong I don't wanna be right Thomas. May I come in? Am I wrong? Am I wrong? For thinking that We could be something for real? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Now, am I wrong? Am I wrong? For trying to reach The things that I can't see? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah That's just how I feel How I feel How I feel, yeah That's just how I feel How I feel How I feel That's just how I feel Trying to reach The things that I can't see Am I wrong? For thinking that We could be something for real? Now, am I wrong? For trying to reach The things that I can't... See? Sorry, ma'am. I feel great about myself. All right, turn around. Let me see. My. After tonight, one of you may become a princess. - You really think so? - I do. After all the bad things that have happened in our lives, wouldn't it be nice if we had something good? It's over. I'm eating a muffin and going to bed. No. Did you make that dress? I suppose it's nice. It's tasteful. Thank you. I'm sorry, I should have said something earlier. But you don't need to go to the ball. What do you mean? Of course I do. No, it's for girls who are unbetrothed, and as of this morning, you are spoken for. That's impossible. I speak for me. No, Thomas has expressed his intentions to marry you. Thomas? But I don't wanna marry Thomas. I reject his intentions. Hush now. Women who are promised away do not go to balls. Take off that dress. Go back to your basement. No, but, please, Stepmother. I have to go. My future depends on it. I spent weeks making this dress, to show women from all over the world... Why would you...? You are to stay home and find a way to be that man's bride. Upset me further, and you will have no one in this life. Poor Ella. She was so looking forward to that ball. - It's a shame. - Absolutely devastating. Guys? Gosh, that's beautiful. What an improvement. - Adventure time. Let's follow it. - Right behind you. I really shouldn't run on a full stomach, but okay. When I feel my fear staring at me I tell it just wait and see I know who I'm gonna be I know who I'm gonna... The world's half asleep It's gonna wake up and see If it's a million-to-one I'm gonna be that one And if it's a shot in the dark I'm gonna be the sun And I just can't afford to be wrong Even when I'm afraid You're gonna know my name You're gonna know my name Yeah You're gonna know my name You're gonna know my... You did it. Well done, my friend. Work, yes. Now this is how you make an entrance. Allow me to introduce myself. I am your Fabulous Godmother. But why? Baby, you saved me. And so now I'm here to save you. By sending you to that ball. I'm not allowed at the ball. And I think you're a figment of my imagination. Let's not ruin this magical moment with reason. Do you wanna go to that ball, and meet rich people who will change your life? Yes, I was just crying and singing about it like two minutes ago. - Okay, so that would be an affirmative? - Yes. - I can't hear you. - Yes. - Like you mean it. - Yes. Then go you shall. When you wish upon a star Your dreams will take you very far yeah When you wish upon a dream Hey, hey. Life ain't always what it seems Shining star come into view Shine its watchful light on you You, you Give you strength to carry on Make your body big and strong - You can't wear that to the ball. - I know. Look at that. This is different. - I've never seen anything like this. - Okay, dang. You said you wanted to be a businesswoman. Think, Fab G, think. Did I miss...? Wait for it. No, no, that design is pure fantasy. - I don't even know if it's possible. - Hush. It's magic time. You know, the wind is really picking up. Maybe we should take this inside. Shining star for you to see What your life can truly be Shining star for you to see What your life can truly be What you can Truly Be This is gorgeous. Yes, future queen, yes. What's that, prince? You'd like to dance? Get in line, Your Highness. Hold on. Where am I going? They're beautiful. They're glass? - Can you make them more comfortable? - No. - But you're magic. - Women's shoes are as they are. Even magic has its limits. How am I gonna...? Feet don't work like this. Getting better. I'm doing it. You're a shining star No matter who you are Shining bright to see What you could truly be - You're a shining star - You know you're a shining star - No matter who you are - No matter who you are, now - Shining bright to see - Yeah What you could truly be Go on with your bad self. I don't suppose you could get me to the ball? - Ho... - ly... fudge. You need footmen. He sees us. Well, well, well. Look at you little disgusting creatures. You will do. - Do for what? - Yeah, do for what? - Do for what? - Do for what? Where's my tail? I can't balance without my tail. You're boys? I always assumed you were girls. Why would you assume that? Everyone knows, mice are girls, and rats are boys. How do you think rats have more rats? Moving away from that. The three of you will make sure that this beautiful young lady gets to the ball. We're going to the palace? We don't know where the palace is. We've not been past the front yard. Except one time we had to leave, because snakes got into the house. - The what? - Yeah. No, we were gonna tell you, but... Okay, focus, people. You are to make sure that she gets to the ball, and that is that. You're a shining star No matter who you are Shining bright to see What you could truly be - You're a shining star - Shining star - No matter who you are - Who you are, now - Shining bright to see - Tell them, Fab G.

Yep, yep, we should... What am I doing? My stepmother will disown me. She'd throw me out into the street. She told me she would. Don't worry. As long as you're in that gown, no one will recognize you. Actually, that's not good. I'm meeting a stranger there who's offered to help me. My, my. You are high-maintenance. Fine. He alone will be the exception. But when the magic wears off... Wait a second. That's possible? Nothing in life ever stays the same. Good or bad. Just remember: When the clock strikes midnight, run. You're a shining You're a shining Star Are we really gonna stay up here the whole night, like lifeless bunting? You know how much I love to dance. Tonight is not about you. It's about me. And keeping an eye on our son. Whether he shows up or not remains to be seen. Would this be a good time to bring up my comprehensive plan to reduce poverty in the urban row housing? - No, darling. Read the room. - Never. Ladies and gentlemen, your prince. Yeah Yeah Hey All right What a man What a man What a man What a mighty good man Gotta say it again now What a man What a man What a man What a mighty good man He's a mighty, mighty good man What a man What a man What a man What a mighty good man Yes, he is What a man What a man What a man What a mighty good man I want to take a minute or two And give much respect due To the man that's made A difference in my world And although most men are ho's He flows on the down-low 'Cause I never heard About him with another girl But I don't sweat it Because it's just pathetic to let it Get me involved In that he said/she said crowd I know that ain't nobody perfect I give props to those who deserve it And believe me, y'all He's worth it So here's to the future 'Cause we got through the past I finally found somebody That can make me laugh You so crazy I think I wanna have your baby What a man What a man What a man What a mighty good man Yes, he is What a man What a man What a man What a mighty good man He's a mighty, mighty good man What a man What a man What a man What a mighty good man Gotta say it again now What a man What a man What a man What a mighty good man Yes, he is, now I'm gonna fight 'em off A seven nation army Couldn't hold me back They're gonna rip it off Taking their time Right behind my back And I'm talking to myself at night Because I can't forget Back and forth through my mind Like a minuet And the message coming from my eyes Says "Leave it alone" And if I catch it coming back my way I'm gonna serve it to you What a man What a man What a mighty good man What a man What a man What a man What a mighty good man And that ain't what you want to hear But that's what I'll do What a man What a man What a mighty good man What a man What a man What a man What a mighty, mighty, mighty good man What a man What a man What a man What a man What a man What a man Did you see me? I lifted her up. - Yeah. - Yeah, I know, I know. Where is she? I'm so sorry. I don't know what I was thinking. No, please, forgive me. I'm not accustomed to being among nobility, Your Grace. Think nothing of it. Tonight we are all equals in the eye of the king. You're too kind. My, what lovely shoes. Yes. They're glass. I could walk in them easily after, like, four steps. Now, if you'll excuse me, I was making my way up to the balcony. Because the best view is always from on high. My God. Look at us. We're standing outside the palace. We're literally breathing the same air as the royal family. Whatever happens after tonight, I'm a changed mouse. Guys. I just relieved myself. You are not gonna believe how it happens. - Through your front tail. We know. - Yes. - Unbelievable, isn't it? - It's like... - You're making me wanna go again. - Go now. - I've not got the urge. - Could tonight be any better? Excuse me, my dear. May I ask you a question? Yes, Your Highness. "Your Highness" was the man whose blood I spilled to take this crown. Call me Tatiana. Queen Tatiana. Of course. Queen Tatiana. Where did you get that dress? It's so structured, and yet so delicate, and... And beautiful. Me... Me did. It's... It's what I... What I done. What I hope... I do... I was... I... I did it. I... I want to. I... Good evening, ladies. First I would like to thank each and every one of you for being here. You are all so beautiful, and have so much to offer. But if I'm being honest... there is only one who has captured my attention. Sadly, I have not cast my eyes on her tonight. Sorry. Words. I designed it. Then I am honored to be in the presence of such an artist. Would it be possible to see more of your work? - More than possible. - Good. I attend lavish events around the world, and I hate all my clothes. I'm looking for someone to travel with me, to enliven my wardrobe. Maybe that person is you. Me? We will meet tomorrow when the clock strikes 4. I have an hour before I catch my ship home. Yes, yes. I'll be at the south end of the market square. Don't be late. It's unlikely I'll return here. And I have no patience for those who misuse my time. - Of course. - After all, I am a fricking queen. This is why you save caterpillars. And then she suggested that I was a mama's boy who still gets a little spanking on the tush-tush. Now, now. Don't act like you haven't heard the rumors. Look, I'm not ashamed to admit that my mother is a wonderful, strong woman. We get along very well. But not that well. My father, on the other hand, well, he's not exactly getting any younger. I'm so sorry. My God. That didn't happen. Even if it did happen, I'm magic, so nobody can see me. Hi. - You look so different. - Me different? You're the one who looks different. All clean and... That's a nice jacket. Why would you let me speak so poorly of you to your face? I admit it was deceitful, but... It worked. Here you are. Yes, and I am leaving. I've seen the dresses, I drank the bubble drink, and now I actually have a chance to make my dreams come true. So I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go while I'm still ahead. - Thank you. - You haven't seen all of the dresses. Ladies and gentlemen, I'd be remiss if I didn't take a moment to acknowledge someone truly special. The people's princess, my little sister. Gwendolyn. That's my dress. That's my dress on the princess. You all right? I'm fine, I'm fine. I just... I need you to stop the room from spinning. Perhaps this will work. Maybe would you like to dance? Right now? I found a love For me Darling Just dive right in And follow my lead Well, I found a boy Beautiful and sweet I never knew you were the someone Waiting for me 'Cause we may be kids But we're so in love Fighting against all odds I know we'll be all right This time Darling Just hold my hand - Be my girl, I'll be your man - Be my man I see my future In your eyes Baby I'm dancing in the dark With you between my arms Barefoot on the grass Listening to our favorite song When I saw you in that dress Looking so beautiful I don't deserve this Darling You look perfect Baby I'm dancing in the dark With you between my arms Barefoot on the grass Listening to our favorite song I have faith in what I see Now I know I have met An angel in person You look perfect - I don't deserve this - I don't deserve this You look perfect Tonight Would you care to talk alone somewhere? Lead the way. What's it like being a crate? This has gotta be a step up, right? So this is the fountain. Do you have a fountain where you live? I don't. I just have streaming water sometimes. - Did you hear that? - What was that? - What? - This is bloody brilliant. What even is that? - We're just banging them together. - I know. Humans can be so loud. You make me nervous. Everything about tonight is insane, right? Blink once if you can understand me. - You all right? - Yeah. Thanks for the jacket. Yeah, no, it's not like I'm cold or anything. Here we are. It's beautiful. I should probably take my shoes off. No, you're fine. This floor is literally 2000 years old. So no? You're fine. Okay. My God. Are you gonna play something on the piano just for me? My God, you are. You're so full of hidden talents. So you might disagree with those who say I serve no real purpose, other than to wreck things? Just so you know, I don't actually think those things about you. Especially now. Well, you should. Well, why? I mean, you're in line to be our future king. It's a bad system. My only qualification being that my dad was one. It's not that I don't want to be king. When I was little, I remember watching my father go off to war, and thinking how brave he looked in his armor. And I wanted to be just like him. And then as I got older, and my life became more about traditions and customs, and people always watching me, and telling me what to do, and never asking... what I want, or how I feel... I know exactly what you mean. What? I just had no idea tonight would go like this. This is precisely how I hoped tonight would go. You're the one. I pick you to be my princess. What's wrong? I assure you, it doesn't matter to me that you're not of royal birth. No, that's not it. We'll get married. We'll get married, and you will live the rest of your life as royalty. Royalty? What about my work? My dresses... That would most likely be frowned upon. - Women have a prescribed role in court. - Prescribed role? I'd make sure that you were dressed by the finest dressmakers. - I'm a dressmaker. - I know. There's just no one else in this world I'd rather be with than you. Robert, stop. I don't want a life stuck waving from a royal box any more than a life confined to a basement. I have dreams that I have to chase. So if it's a choice... I choose me. I understand. Really, I... I do. I found a love I found a boy I'm sorry. What time is it? It's midnight. I have to go. Wait. I don't like this. Something's changed. Relax. We are fine. - You cleaned phantom whiskers. - I did not. You did too. Where are you off to, my dear? Am I to assume I've lost you to the prince? No, my queen. I'll meet you tomorrow, I promise. What's happening? My good people, your future queen. - Help. - This way. This way. Wilbur. You go. I'll take care of this. Thank you so much. I'll never forget this. Neither will I. - The magic's wearing off. - What are we gonna do? - What did the butterfly say? - He called us disgusting, that jerk. - What was said about the magic? - I don't know. I was singing. - Why didn't you pay attention? - Because I was singing. Dress your feet for comfort. Get in. Halt, I say. Come on. Quick. - Get in. - Quickly. - Hurry. - Come on. Look, she threw a glass shoe at me. I feel all tingly, like I'm gonna... Now I'm feeling tingly. I don't wanna go... Don't look at me. Don't look at me. I'm starting to feel a bit funny. - I feel tingly. - No. No. No. Are we going down? We're going down. Just be quiet as a mouse. Maybe we're not going... All the townspeople's tax dollars, wasted on a ball, and for what? For you to make a complete fool out of me? To teach me a lesson? I'm sorry, Father. You are singlehandedly destroying my legacy. I know you might not understand this, but the woman I chose didn't choose me. I'm sorry, darling. Have you lost your mind? You are the future king, and as king, it is all about you and your power. There are no other opinions. None. Is this a good time to ask why we are spending money on catapults when we have so many already? It really just benefits the catapult makers. Quiet, Gwen. I really think we just need to get some sleep. No one asked you, Beatrice. Your time is up, Robert. You will marry Princess Laura by week's end. I don't care if you don't love each other. So says the king. If the Crown demands it... Milord. Darling. What? Did you really just say you don't care if they love each other? Yeah. I want the sea monster. What? Beatrice, don't be... - Your Highness. - Yes? - Where'd you find that? - It's the girl's. She threw it at my head. I'm lucky to be alive. Look at our girl. Been up all night, working. She's betting on herself. I couldn't do it. I would've married the prince. You think the prince would've picked you? Cuddly, cute, good at waving. I mean, come on. I can hear you. I bet you're arguing about why I didn't just say yes to marrying Robert. Especially since I'm maybe in love with him. Love? It was one night. I never felt what I felt last night before. I mean, you guys, he's so handsome. - He is incredibly handsome. - Annoyingly handsome. - The cheekbones. - He likes me for me. - Sounds like true love to this mouse. - You're right, my friend. But... if saying yes to him means saying no to this... I can't do it. All right, guys? I have to try and make a life for myself. By myself. Because that is what I want. And Queen Tatiana is my chance. Right. - Who's Queen Tatiana? - Cinderella? Are you down there? - Stepmother? - Dear God, no. - She scares me. - Me too. Hello? I'm waiting for my tea. Cinderella? I'm coming down. I'm sick. You didn't miss much at the ball. The prince was fixated on some mystery girl. Then she ran away like a twit. So now he's to marry Princess Laura of Northphalia, the day after next. Malvolia and Narissa never stood a chance. And I was so foolish to believe differently. A mother just gets carried away. I know I've been hard on you. It's not fueled by spite. I've never shared this with anyone before, but... I used to play piano. Taught myself. And I was good. I was really good. Nothing made me happier. Then one day, I was given the opportunity to train at the finest school of music. And I took it. There I was, two children, a loving husband, and I had the audacity to want more. It was just a month. One month. And yet when I returned, my husband, well... he believed real wives didn't act so frivolously. You may think me cruel. But the real cruelty would be for me to allow you to think that you can be something you can't. This shoe. It was you. Cinderella, I don't know how you did what you did last night. But the prince chose you. He loves you. Marry him, and all of our problems will be solved. I can't. I told him I didn't wanna marry him. Tell him you were wrong. Tell him it's all you want. If not for yourself, then do it for us, for your family. I can help our family. I can provide for us. Don't be so stupid. Who taught you to think that way? Please, don't throw away this opportunity. Go back to him. It's too late. He's marrying someone else. It's over. Fine. Then I'm taking you to Thomas, and I'm giving you to him. Today. I would rather die. I don't care This is life It's not fair It's not right All that hope And that pride It's a waste It's a lie All you want is to breathe Little girls should run free But your corset's too tight And your heels are too high The treasure you found Bury it The only way out Marry it The shadow of doubt Carry it Carry it down to your grave, The world doesn't need another dream girl The world doesn't need another dream girl You're too dumb You're too young Full of heart So naive You're so blind You're so green You'll give up Just like me The wings are ornamental They have no intention of letting you fly Don't be sentimental Some legends are born in the wrong time - The treasure you found - Bury it - The only way out - Marry it - The shadow of doubt - Carry it Carry it down to your grave Bury it Marry it Carry it - Carry it down to your grave - Bury it - Your grave - Marry it - Your grave - Carry it - Bury it - Bury it - Marry it - Marry it - Carry it - Carry it, - No, no, no - Bury it, marry it, carry it - No, no - No - Bury it - Bury it - Marry it - Marry it - Carry it - Carry it Bury it Marry it Carry it Carry it Carry it down to your grave Your grave Your grave The world doesn't need Another dream girl Leave us. You haven't spoken to me since last night. You're mad because I yelled at you. I hate to break it to you, but kings yell. Please, say something. You're making me wildly uncomfortable. You ever wondered why Robert makes the process to marry so difficult? Because he's a spoiled child, who refuses to grow up. Simple. I believe it's because of the example set before him by us. A marriage without love, without respect. Bea, please, you know I love you. Saying love and showing love are two very different things, Rowan. Before you were king, I felt your love every day. You couldn't stand to be away from me, even for a moment. Remember you used to appear at my window, like a knight in shining armor, and you'd serenade me with your skull-splitting voice. We were young. Things... change. No, you changed. The crown changed you. You're so worried to look a fool. So obsessed with your reputation, with your legacy. It's only my life's work. It causes me a great deal of stress. Do you think you're the only person who feels stress? God, try being your bloody wife. It is utterly exhausting to sit next to you, and just smile, as if I were nothing more than a prop, my voice completely silenced. What I wouldn't give to say you're wrong, in front of the entire kingdom. Bea, you're being unreasonable now. Well, if you say so. After all, you're the king. Can't be any other opinions other than yours. You know, there's never a guarantee with a couple in our position. But we had love, Rowan. We had it. And now... Robert's wiser than both of us. Hello. I'm ready. You summoned me, Your Highness. We can't have a regular conversation like a normal father and son? No, no, to satisfy your power trip, you have to sit there in your slightly-too-tall throne. You belittle me in your king voice. Yes. All because you're so insecure with your legacy that you have to control my every move. I ask you, does that sound like a strong leader to you? Robert. I was wrong. I, King Rowan... Am I doing the king voice? A bit. You can't help yourself. Go find the owner of this glass slipper. And if she'll take you back, then marry her. Or don't. It's your life, son. Why the sudden change of heart? Well, definitely wasn't your mom. Go on, leave now. Be bold. Hear ye Hear ye Hear ye If you don't know yet You won't believe what I'm about to tell But our handsome young prince At the ball, well, he fell For a pretty young lady I hear quite the stunner Who then turned out to be Quite the runner See, at the end of the night This woman split so fast Left no name, no ID Just a shoe made of glass And now he's looking for the girl With the other glass slipper No buckles, no laces Not even a zipper The shoe, the shoe Does it look like this? That's a dirty old boot Swing and a miss It's hard for me to tell Could my foot be right? Your foot's the size of a canoe, ma'am Way too tight How unfortunate for me That I birthed ten sons That is too bad. But I like those vocal runs. Hey, hey, hey People, look, it ain't me Who needs convincing I ain't the one With the ring-a-ding-ding Go home, get your girls In the shoe that goes bling And don't show it to me Tell it to your future king Not her. Worth a try. No. Don't they know I'm looking for her? No. Nope, not her. Nope. Nope. Nope. No. Not interested. I mean, me neither. You don't say. We're not going to find her. We should just go home. I can't. I have to let her know it's possible between us. It's a beautiful thing, how much you love her. - You crying, Hench? - So what if I am? Would that we all have what Robert has. I mean, what is life if you're not with the person you love? Right? Otherwise, we might as well just close our eyes, and take the old mud nap, because... nothing else matters. So we find her, then. Robert, where did you see her the last time you went searching? I am the king's idiot son. Cinderella's been working on her recipes for you. Well, I should hope so. If it's a million-to-one - Two. - Three. For Ella! Remember me as a hero. If it's a million-to-one I wanna taste love and pain If it's a shot in the dark I wanna feel pride and shame - I don't wanna take my time - I just can't afford to be wrong - Don't wanna waste one life - Even when I'm afraid - Could have been me - You're gonna know my name - Don't wanna live as an untold story - You're gonna know my You're gonna know my name Rather go out in a blaze of glory You're gonna know my Whoa, my... - You all right? - Hey. What are you doing here? Are you hurt? - No, I'm fine. I just really have to... - Good. I've been looking for you. - Why? - I have something that I wanna say. You inspired me. Me? It never occurred to me that I could choose the course of my own life. See, I always felt that it was written for me. But watching you, I realized, anything is possible. That's so sweet. I'm really in a hurry. If we could talk about it... I realize now, I can have a life that is all mine. Great. This is gonna be a lengthy discussion. What I'm trying to say is that I choose me. God, this is not coming out how I wanted it to. I don't have to be king. It is not what I want anymore. You are. So, what I'm saying is, choosing me is choosing us. That is, as long as you feel the same way. Your silence is... That was the most romantic moment of my life. Same. - You rode up on a horse. - I did. - It was really cool. - You look so beautiful. - You look so handsome. - Thank you. Gotta go. Put me on that horse, and get me to the market square, please. - Okay. - What? - No. I can walk. It's faster. - I'm sorry. But thank you. That's really nice. Beatrice! Beatrice! What fresh hell is this? Beatrice. It is I, your knight in shining armor. You can't be serious. Darling, suspend what you know to be true. Just... Just go with it. No. He's gonna sing. This is me Showing you That I love you Like I used to You really don't have to do this. But I do, darling. This is exactly what you wanted. No, no. Not really. You are more important Than any sea monster to me Everybody. - We made babies together - We made babies together My God. I love you - That's enough. - Yes, thank you. Big finish. I'm so sorry I acted like a... Unbelievably Pigheaded Numbskull Numbskull - Numbskull - Numbskull Numbskull My love. - Can I come up? - Yes, if you can get your armor off. Shoot. Pack your bags. Huzzah! Yes. Mother? Father? In here, being immortalized. There's someone I would like you to meet. I'm Ella. How lovely. Yes. Yeah, I remember you. You're the statue girl. - That wasn't me. - Yes, it was. I'm good with faces. So do I have a wedding to prepare? No pressure. But there's an absurd amount of pastries left from that ball. No, no. We're not in a rush to get married. Instead, we're going to travel the world together. I'm sorry if my decision disrupts your plans for succession. That's all right. It just so happens I share blood with another who, one day, will be the greatest leader the realm has ever known. Hear that, Gwen? What's happening? Gwen, my darling girl, I hereby place you first in line to inherit the crown. Don't stab me in my sleep. I shall be king? Queen. I'll take it. Good. Just so we're clear, I'm going to rule the land? - Yes. - Okay. Everyone heard that? - We did. Yes. - Yeah. So many ideas. Like... I don't know where to begin. - Good. Can I take this crown off? - Yes. Shall we have some tea? It is my honor to guide this kingdom forward into a new era. And to pay my deepest respects to my brother, Prince Robert. And his new... - What are we calling you? - Well... I mean, we don't have to put a label on it. In love? I don't know. In love? Yeah. In love. And his new love, Ella. Ella, I believe this belongs to you. My mother's brooch. I thought it could inspire you on your voyage. Thank you. That's enough mirth. Celebration's over. Everyone, go home. Back to work. - Come on. Let's go. - No. You're wrong. Let's get loud Let's get loud Let's get loud Turn the music up Let's do it Come on, people Let's get loud Yes, let's get loud Turn the music up To hear that sound Let's get loud Let's get loud Let's get loud - Ain't nobody gotta tell ya - What you gotta do If you wanna live your life Live it all the way - And don't you waste it - Don't you waste it No, no, no Every feeling Every beat Can be so very sweet - You gotta taste it - You gotta taste it You gotta do it You gotta do it Gotta do it your way You gotta groove it Don't you let nobody lead you astray You gotta prove it You gotta prove it Gotta mean what you say Like...
