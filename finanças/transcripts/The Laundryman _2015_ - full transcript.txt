Lin. Yes. I'll wait till you come out of jail. Then I'll be with you for the rest of your life. But now I'm in this body. Do you mind? Mr. Liao? I'm Tu Hsiang-wen! You don't remember me? I've taught so many students. I can't remember you all... No... The student who could recite the longest poem in history! He didn't miss a single word! So good?! No? It was me! Tu Hsiang-wen! It's been more than ten years! Sir, you're still teaching, right? There were more than 200 students in the class. Is the business still going well? Well, not bad. If you're so good at Chinese, why are you doing this? I was hopeless at math. I couldn't understand anything you taught. You beat me every day, but I never got it. You must have got it wrong. I never beat my students. Ah? I don't beat my students. You don't beat your students? Right. Actually, I'm not Tu Hsiang-wen. Someone asks me to kill you. Who'd want to kill a cram school teacher? Take me with you next time! Your favorite. Cleaned it up? Yes. Thank you! No problem. Any problem? No. It's a piece of cake. Hey. We've got a new order. He likes big tall women. Oh? No! I'm a man! Please... No. Please... No. No. Please... No. No. Or you have any better idea? No. How about a kiss? Then forget it. Eh? No? What is it? Fuck! Shit! You're not Emily? I'm Vivian. Pervert! How about Together... It's okay. I'll do it myself. Sorry Hi. I'm scared... This is my place! But I don't mind. Bye bye! They're ghosts! Real ghosts! You've been doing this for years. Why now? When I hit the old couple, I banged my head. Then I saw them. Didn't I ask you to talk to Dr. Tsai? Did you talk to him? He's weird! What do you mean? He said I was too stressed. I'll be fine if I masturbate enough. I know an incredible medium. Let me see... You said Mr. Tsai is incredible. Well, she's hot. Really? Definitely not my type. She looks cheap. Go see her. I'll pay for it. Why so generous? Because... You're my best boy! I'm a man. Show me! Sorry. Sorry. Can you guys stop following me? I've given you my place. What else do you want? I'll sleep in the bathroom. Okay? I'll sleep in the bathroom. Okay? Leave me alone. I'm so tired. Let me sleep. Leave me alone. Why are you here? That's my question for you! It's my room! OK. Wimp! Are you Miss Lin, the hottest medium and exorcist? Yes. You look different from the ad. So you'll be nicely surprised when you meet me! How should we start? Please get your hand off my leg. You brought them with you? You've got too much bad karma! So you can see them? Of course! Can you get rid of them for me? I haven't slept well for half a year. See the dark circles under my eyes? Every time when I'm in the toilet, they... It's okay. I can help. But since you've got so much bad karma, it's not going to be easy... So... need a lot of “kids”. Kids? Ah, I see! Is a wad enough? Even a stack isn't enough! You'll have a sky-high column if you help me get rid of them! You're something! You love taking selfies with the ghosts? How long have they haunted you? You took so many pictures. Quite a while. Thereason they follow you is they either need your help or take revenge on you. Did you ask them why? They can't talk. So you... You can see them but can't hear them? Let me tell you a secret. Sometimes... You can probably touch them. And smell them. Smell them? Yup. Sir, you can't wait? Then we'll start with you. Lin. Is it done? Not so easy. There is something even more exiting. Wanna see it? Don't be afraid! What have I done wrong? Who on earth asked you to kill me? Who on earth asked you to kill me? Ouch, it hurts! Why are you lying under me? You climbed on top of me. Aha! It's not me. It doesn't count. Ah, why are my prayer beads scattered all over? What do you mean? Well... You tell me! A spirit can't touch you until he possesses someone's body. Why doesn't he possess me and make me kill myself? You need to be a psychic to be possessed. How are we going to solve it? Did I say anything? You asked me why I killed him. Who asked me to kill him... You killed him?! No wonder he's going after you! Sit down! I was just doing my job. Like what you're doing now. Will... you kill me too? I won't kill you. You have to find out who is behind the hit. You killed them all? But not the girl. You're so cruel! How could you kill such old people! I'm sorry. Er... Does a hitman... ...get paid a lot? Why don't you ask them? No, no, it's okay. I'm exhausted Every time I get possessed, I burn at least 6 kcal! See you soon. Lin! Your wig. I'll charge more next time. A-Gu. What? Who paid us to kill that guy in the motel? You know the rules. Why ask? The ghosts don't disappear. Lin says they've unfinished business in this world. I have to know who wanted to kill them. Or I can't do anything about it. I've told you there is no ghost in the world! It doesn't matter what she says. It's all in your head. It's all delusion! Did you stop taking medicine recently? I ran out of it. Tell me when it runs out. You can't stop taking it. I'll get the pills for you. (Missing person search on official database) Car loan, home loan and credit card debts... My mom is in the hospital. So many mouths to feed... It's so hard to be a gangster nowadays... Gangsters have to pay their bills too. Repay the money! Or you'll face the consequences! Lin. Let's go. Hey, who the hell are you? I'm talking! You want me to kill him? No, no! Don't kill him!

I didn't kill people. I didn't say you killed people. You said I killed people. I didn't say I killed people. You mentioned killing. I didn't. You kept saying I killed people, but I didn't. Why did you want to kill him? I don't know. Anyway, I didn't kill anyone. Why? I didn't say you killed. You said it. I don't know then... Why did you want to kill him? Anyway I didn't kill anyone! You mentioned killing first. I didn't kill anyone. I said a killer. I didn't say you killed someone. I'm not a killer. I didn't kill anyone. You're not a killer, but I am. I killed him, alright?

From that day onwards, I wanted to kill him. I went to the supermarket to get a knife. Then I met a very pretty woman. It doesn't suit you. Deep in your heart, you want to kill someone. Right? No, I don't. You're still young. You have a bright future ahead of you. Never do anything stupid. As for what you want to do... Leave it to us. We clean not only your clothes but the stain in your life. Write your wish down. The damned man will disappear. Sometimes, your wish will never be granted. But sometimes, a whimsical idea could be materialized with some help. I thought the woman was joking But I wanted to give it a try. And the guy really disappeared! Do you... ...want me to kill him? What? What are you doing? Well, if you want me to kill him, turn the light off. Can we not turn the light off? Don't turn the light off! Don't let him kill him! You're not going to kill him, right?

A fatal incident happened in an apartment in Taipei City. The deceased was shot in his head at home. The police say a gun is found in his hand. A suicide note is found so it might be the case. According to TVBS, the deceased was a model maker and lived alone. Here's our correspondent on the scene. Yes. From the crime scene, we can tell it is in a very quiet neighborhood. The police are still investigating. Men who fold the sheets too wide are careless. Who fold the long sides first are workaholic. Who fold the short sides first are scared of their wives. Who hold too tight... ...are cooking something up! No... What are you cooking up with Lin? Nothing... Nothing? I need to deal with the ghosts. I've told you it's just your illusion... I... I know... It's illusion. I got it. You're psychic! Chu! No one will pay you back if I died. Don't kill me! What are you talking about? Hey, please don't be like this... I beg you... Please don't kill me. I'm not going to kill you. I'm not going to kill you. I'm not going to kill you. I'm not going to kill you. You killed the guy. You come to silence me, don't you? What? I didn't kill him. I didn't. You liar! It's all over the news! If it wasn't you, who did it? I don't know. It wasn't him? Really? Then who did it? Who are you asking? None of your business. Go back to sleep. It doesn't matter if you're scared or not. You have to help me deal with them. It's gonna cost you extra. OK. Miser! You know murders are difficult to deal with! Which cases aren't difficult? Love affairs, family problems are fine. Murders are so disgusting! Fine, fine. As long as you help me sort out those three, I promise I won't bother you again. Three? You didn't kill her. Why should you deal with her? She's been following me! Please. Please. Please. How much further are you going? You keep swaying before me. I'm getting dizzy! It's such a difficult job! You kill, look for people and find the bodies. Now you want me to climb! How about getting a new job? See? You can drive up here! Why do we have to walk? Wait for me! I'll bring it to you. It'd be easier if you did it straightaway! Where is the rest? Where is the rest? It's gone. Then give me 8 million. You got your parents' insurance payout, eh? I don't have that much money! It was a lot of money, right? I spent it all! Only 6000 dollars left. I'll give it to you. 6000? No need to give it back... Really? What do you want? Nothing... Stop beating... Stop beating! If you kill him, he'll become a ghost to haunt you! Hey, don't be like this. It's a lovely day! Let's have a picnic! What the hell! What on earth do you want? Where did you get it from? I ran over your parents. I did it. Tell me why. Show some respect for privacy, okay? Okay? It's not me who wants to know. Who else wants to know? I loved them. Loved them? Then why did you want them dead? You underestimate love! For Christ's sake, love is sacred... My dad had always asked me to be the best. Best grades in the exams. First prize in any contest. Also the piano competition. I won the first place in the baby crawling contest! My dad always told me real life isn't like a competition. You don't get a silver for coming second. So your dad beat you? No! He was very nice to me. Every time when I didn't get good grades, he encouraged me to 'work harder!' Wasn't it nice? Nice? Was it nice? He encouraged me to "work harder!" But no other words. He encouraged me to work harder. But all I saw in his eyes was disappointment. Later I met a bunch of scums. I began to use drugs. I spent all my money on drugs. Once... When I was about to chop him with the cleaver... Work harder! I really didn't want to hear the phrase anymore. I let myself become an asshole. So he wouldn't have any expectation of me or say "work harder" to me anymore... So you killed them just because of this? I didn't want to... Later in a bar, I met a very pretty woman. In a bad mood? You look like you're about to kill someone. Yes, I'm tempted to kill. Who you wanna kill? Everyone. Life is short. Don't let anybody tell you what to do. Laundry? Are you kidding me? Think it over. Make a wish. It doesn't hurt even if it's not granted. (Hsinmei Laundry) How could I expect that you would really kill my parents?! You regretted it? I thought you enjoyed spending the money? Do you need me to do anything? Who are you talking to? Your parents. My parents? What? Bao... It's me. Come here You can't survive alone in this world. Come with us! Give it to me. Uncle, please! Let the young ones take it over. You are about to retire. Take it easy, okay? Uncle, you really want to look into it! I'm just looking around. Whatever. (Targets: Mr. & Mrs. Chen) (Expected way to die: by accident) The old couple died in a car accident. But the strangest thing is their son bought an insurance policy just two months before it happened. How dare he! (Company information: Ministry of Economic Affairs) (Hsinmei Laundry Ltd. Company Rep. Ou Jui-hua) (Ou Jui-hua) (Incited to kill by the psychiatrist? Dr. Ou: It's the patient's free will.) (Dr. Ou Jui-hua Mingen Sanatorium) Can I help you? Police. Excuse me. Do you know them? No, I don't. Can you think more carefully? I can't remember. You do origami? They look great. Thanks. Just something to entertain myself while waiting for the customers. So you know how to fold clothes, right? Sure. Every day I wash, iron and fold clothes... What I mean is... ...folding something like this. It's basic origami. I guess many people can do it. (Mingen Sanatorium) Dr. Ou is a genius. She got a double Ph.D. in Psychology and Sociology when she was only 23. She spent a long time studying the connection between the youth's mental problems and the area that controls the violent behavior in the brain. She found a group of teenagers who committed violent crimes for her research. The patients taking part in the project were put in this place. (No.6, Dongda Rd.) What does "Dongda Rd." mean? Dr. Ou didn't want the children to feel labeled. The blocks were named after the initials of the disorders. Here's for those with major depression. D for "depression" so it's called "Dongda Rd." There you see. It's the Criminal Section. As it begins with "C", it's called "Chingtian St." (No.1, Chingtian St.) What was she like? Dr. Ou? She was very nice. She treated the kids like her own. What got into you? You even killed our client? I didn't kill him. You didn't? Then who did it? The ghost killed him. What's wrong with you? I feel I don't know you anymore. Well, no... It's just... If I don't deal with it, these ghosts... You even left the body on the scene! I swear I didn't kill him! So why should I clean it up? The ghost possessed Lin and killed him. Then you must silence her. No. Thanks. You wanna get us into trouble? No, I won't do it. The suitcase, please. Long time no see, Miss Lin. I... you know... I'm just a fortune teller.

Forget it, thanks. Just accept it. Or it may be your last cigarette... Hello? Hello? Where are you? Lin! I'm in the hotel. So... You're going to help me? Is the female ghost with you? She isn't here. Ahhhhhh! There are so many other ghosts here! You stay there. Don't leave. Which hotel are you in? I'll come to you. It's Lin. Open the door! Open the door! It's not locked! Save me. Sing the ghost song to them! The ghost song! You never heard it when you were little? A ghost comes to me It has long hair and a gray face Hey, you. Who are you? Why don't you have eyes or a mouth?

I'm a ghost I want you to keep me company, talking to me Run! What the... I put a barrier spell on this room. Wow, cool! Can you put that barrier spell on me? Pay more! Then I'll think of something. Fine. But the female ghost isn't here. How can we start? She was standing outside your door when I arrived. Now she's already in here. You're awesome! Think about what you're going to ask her. I've decided! Let's start! Hello. I want you to take revenge on my behalf. On whom? My ex-husband! He's addicted to gambling. He lost all the money we had. And he often beat me. I couldn't bear so I divorced him. But after we got divorced, he kept harassing me. What's your ex-husband's name? He's name is Tang Wu-Hsiung. He thought I had a lover. So he knocked me out and drove me to the woods. He buried me alive! So... You want me to kill him? Are you alright? Lin. Mrs. Tang? I'm not feeling well. You do it yourself then! What? I'm not feeling well! I need to leave this body for a while. You can do it yourself. No! I never saw him before. Even if he's standing here, I won't recognize him! Is that him? Mrs. Tang? You sure you want him dead? Don't ask me! I told you I'm not feeling well... What a bloody driver! Really bloody! Did you hit him? Did you?! I didn't hit him! I didn't hit him! You didn't hit him? You didn't hit him? Why didn't you? I just couldn't bring myself to do it. You can stay with me, Mrs. Tang. You'll support me? Lin? Mrs. Tang is gone. How could it be possible? You miss her? Shall I ask her to come back? No. Will you be okay on your own? You can't call it killing. We're cleaning the stains in their lives. As for the police officer killed in the street, the injured officer died in the hospital. Detective Tang was at the CID in Taipei. Devoted to his job, Tang remained single all his life. His colleagues said Tang was a very nice man. As his head was deliberately run over twice, the perpetrator's intention to kill was clear. It's a cold-blooded murder. According to the CCTV, the police target a van and a motorcycle. The investigation continues. Who on earth was Tang Wu-Hsiung? The female ghost's ex-husband! Tell me. Who was Tang Wu-Hsiung? He was never married. How could he have an ex-wife? You... What do you want? I warn you... If you dare to kill me, I'll become a ghost to haunt you! I've always trusted you. I've always trusted you. Why did you lie to me? Your boss! She came to see me. And asked me to trick you into killing the policeman! Why? How could I know? A killer's boss asks me to do it, would I dare to say no? So you were acting all along? Yes. Weren't you wearing the prayer beads? They're fake. The real ones are in my bag. You're finished. You know that? Well, it can't be that bad... I have been through a lot... What happened just now? Someone wanted to kill me... I knew... I can't get away with it this time. Run away! The further you go, the better. How about you? Would you like to come with me? Bring me Uncle's stuff. I'll check inside. Ma'am. Be careful. I'm sorry. We're closed. Police. I've got a few questions for you. Why do you police love to come after business hour. Did he come here before? Yes. What did he ask? He showed me the pictures of four people. But I knew none of them. After Dr. Ou left, we moved the patients to the new building. What happened? There were few murders in the area. The police suspected Dr. Ou's patients were involved. Some claimed Dr. Ou incited them to kill. You can have the documents I keep. In the end, there wasn't enough evidence. But her license was revoked as a result of medical malpractice. (Mingen Sanatorium) Hello sir, we finished here. How is it going with you? Hello sir? Hello? Can you hear me? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Can I check inside? Dr. Ou? Dr. Ou. Didn't you work in a institute? I was tired of teaching and doing research. My father left this dry cleaning plant to me. To earn a living, I opened a laundry shop. You're the only one in such a big plant? The staff are off work. Why don't you get off the car? It's not where I'm going... But it's where I'm going. I think you had better not go in... I think... You had better run away. The further, the better. Don't come over! Don't come over! Well... you... You take care yourself. Don't worry. I'm just going to talk to her. Be careful. The machine is hot. A-Gu! Let her go. Put the weapon down. Fine, let's both put the weapon down, okay? Alright? Now you've turned against me! A-Gu. My Grand Supreme Lord, if you think I should go in, please give me your approval. Thank you so much! Since when you've become so sentimental? I'm not asking you properly? Please, my Lord... A-Gu, not everyone deserves to die. Now you've become God of Mercy? A-Gu. We're wrong! We're wrong! Even a useless man deserves to live. You're useless! Useless people should be destroyed. My Lord. I'm being truly sincere. Please, I beg of you. Please give me your approval. It's a matter of life and death. I beg of you, please... Please... Hi. Why did you come back? We've got one last ghost to sort out. Lin. What are you doing? No. 6 Dongda Rd... Do you still remember me? Stop it!! That's me! I've been following you. You don't recognize me? You look different. You haven't seen me since I was fourteen! That's right! Where have you been? Dr. Ou locked me up. Is that right? Dr. O-U... Why did you tell us she ran away? She did run away. But I caught her. And locked her up in the basement. She gave me a knife and asked me to stab you when you were asleep. But I stood before you for ages... For ages and ages... She did stand there for ages... But she just couldn't stab you. She even stole a kiss from you. You were watching?! Ugh. You're in love. No, I'm not! You're the one in love! What happened? She'd have survived had she killed. He was so cute. How could I do that? You were such a failure! I thought you were the most promising one. Yet you disappointed me today! You destroyed my career of a lifetime! A-Gu! I'm sorry... I'm sorry. Lin, you're still alive? I thought you had died... You bled... Hello? Lin? I thought you had died. You bled so much... Lin had died on that day. You missing her a lot? I'll wait till you come out of jail. I'll be with you for the rest of your life. But now I'm in this body. Do you mind? What? I'm joking! Oh, you! You're so annoying! Take care of yourself. I'll come see you when I'm free. Bye for now. Bye. Bye bye, my best boy.
