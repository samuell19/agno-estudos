Married couple. Soldiers. It's incredible. A whole colony of people posted down here in the widlerness to look after one life. Hang... hang on. Hold it... hold it. Oh, my God! Oh! - You alright? - Yeah. Like somebody's uh... somebody's build a tank trap! I'm never gonna get out of this thing! Isn't that the point? No sweat. We got the phone, we got food, we got water. Hey, hey, we got company. Umm, I think we may have taken a wrong turn. Uh, our map is out of date. If... if you can just help us get out, we... we can get back to the main drag. You are the ones, I think. You believe you know who I am? Yes? You want proof? No. No, no. No, we don't need proof. We trust you. Imperialists! All those sweet words! And then they kill you for a [---] Come. Come! Well... we found him. OK, we got 2 of us and 1 of him. You think you can get that rifle off him? Don't even think about it. Suvorin. Order of the Hero of the Soviet Union. What was that all about? He said his time is coming. What's that mean? It... it means we were expected. Well, looks like we're not the first people to have come here. These people came here? Yes. They say they're tourists. What are they looking for? Wolves? No. They were surprised. I have their confessions here. They denied it first. But admitted it all by then. These look like bloodstains. Think we have to make confessions? Capitalism is thievery. We protect ourselves from these capitalists, these stinking, crawling thieves of all mankind, only by ferocious vigilance. Tell me about the Chizhikov's, comrade. He brought you up like you were their child. He was a soldier and a hunter. When he drank, he beat me. Comrade, until I'm in blood. How did he die? He was so drunk, he fell into one of his own traps. [---] death. And his wife? She must have been like a mother to you. She was. When she was old, she couldn't work. It was a hard thing to do. But for the best. Would... would you like to see a picture of your real mother? I have one here. I have pictures of my father, that is all I need. My father used to make his comrades dance. Dance for me! Dance! Ah! Jesus! Ah! Hey! wake up! wake up! - Where is he? - I don't know. I don't know if he gonna make us breakfast or kill us. You know I'll be a lot happier if somebody in this world knew where we are. Guess we're not prisoners. We're meant to be here. Too many coincidences. Ah, what do you mean? You got a tip, a voice on the phone. That the Beria mansion has literally a door left wide open for me. The old man at Communist HQ, he dust off all his old files 'cause I give him some bullshit story about writing a book. Mamantov is behind this. OK, I've got a blinding hangover. What are you saying? His whole... platform is based upon a "Return to Stalinlism" And what do you think the dispossessed and disaffected is gonna do when he wheels out the New Messiah? No one is going to give a shit, the guy looks like Davy E. Crock... He's Stalin's son. That man's father is responsible for more deaths than Adolf Hitler, Pol Pot, and Genghis Khan combined. And that is a conservative estimate. 30 million Russians think that man's dad did a good job. Ah shit! There's just too many trees. This far north you gonna have the dish at really lower angle to send a signal. We need more space. You know, I think we gonna need an escape route. Maybe you want to... go down there and see if there's a boat, or a canoe of some kind. All right. Watch your step. He's got traps, remember? There you go, R.J. Alright, you should be getting the unedited material now. Then I'll do an actual intro, OK? I'll talk to you in 5. Here in the northern tundra of Russia, a story is unfolding which will shake the world. For 50 years, this forbidden wilderness has hidden a secret, known only to a handful of fanatical, hardlined communists faithful to the memory of Josef Stalin. What the hell are you doing? You can't put that out there. That's what they want. You heard what the old log chopper said, huh, "His time is coming!" Any minute he going to polish his boots and march into town. Turn that camera off. Now, look, look, this is my story, Doc. And your book. Well I not gonna write it. Nah, just, come on... Press! Press! You should have gotten on that plane, Professor. Where is he, the man you came to see? He was here when we left. Look, I.. I would just want to say that I am a acredited journalist, OK? And my bureau does know that I am here, alright? Then they'll wonder what happend to you. Run! Run! Run! - You OK? - No! My shin! my shin! Hello... Hello, can you... Da. I'm afraid he is. - Where is O'Brian? - He's dead. What? There were soldiers. Then how safe are we now? I don't have anybody left alive to report back. So that's just give us a couple of hours. Did Mamantov send them? No, the Kremlin. Mamantov wants me alive. - Is it him? - Yes. So what does it mean? It means that poor old O'Brian let the genie out of the bottle. Come on! Where is the rest? I got you out of jail. This is yours. Explain to me why did Mamantov want you to find this? This has no credibilty if it is suddenly produced by an old school hardliner like Mamantov. It stings of forgery and self interest. And me, I'm a Western academic. I'm a published author. And... and I... I'm an objective... expert on all things Stalin. And my father was a part of this? Yeah. So why did he die? He didn't... follow the script. When I told him how valuable this was, he... ...he only wanted to leave it to you. I tell you it's cursed. It's yours. It's ours. It's ours. When we get to Moscow, we go straight to the American Embassy, and we'll get out of Russia. We? Come with me, to New York. Nice fantasy. You awake? The only time I ever connected with my father was when he taught me how to use a gun. He hardly spoke to my brother and me. He could not touch us. Never hold us. He was brutalised. Many of us were. I was... too young to understand. My mama always did. Even his silences. Or his drunken rages. She'd always shown compassion. She understood what they've made him. Dr. Kelso, come please, and...uh, bring it. Come on, please! You... would destory this? You are historian. You have this burning urge to preserve every historical document. This for you, is the way back, better than your wildest dreams. Getting famous all over again. You go on television, lecture college campuses. Screw many girls. It's your way back! That's the problem. No. It is all mutual benefit, this whole plan. Good plan. I used KGB funds to buy Beria's mansion. I financed conferences you speak at. First class tickets, free vodka, how could you resist? Tortoruing and killing old man, was that part of the plan? And what about those psychopaths running around in the woods? A glitch. But everything turned out good for both of us, huh? Win, win. Yes? Well let's see. You got a mad man on the loose. And maybe suffering from a major congenital defect. You think you can control him? If he's his father's son, which I truly believe he is. You could be one of his first victims. Maybe he's right, comrade. Maybe I play gramophone, and make you dance. We're stopping at the next station. - Where are we? - Vologda. - They let you go? - Mamantov's on the train, with Josef. My God! Jesus Christ! It's already started. Listen, get off this train now. Pay someone to drive you to Moscow. Go to the airport and get on a plane. - To go where? - Anywhere. Huh, and where are you going? To do what they want. Hey, what's going on? Have you seen R.J.? - R.J. is dead. - What? - Can you put that on me? - Yeah. Film this guy. I am Professor Christopher Kelso. This... This whole spectacle has been contrived and stage managed by a man whose only goal is absolute power through torture and...
