Wait for the inspector. Hello, ma'am. I need to meet Thangaraj sir. You'll find him at the hotel. [SONG PLAYING ON RADIO] 'Is there a man without worries?' 'Is there a man without worries?' 'Is there a man without worries?' I served two cups at the station. So totally 12 cups of tea. Okay. Come get it in the evening. Don't come when the sub-inspector is around. - Okay, sir. Sir! You're Arivazhagan? - Yes, sir. Here. Want coffee, or tea? - No, sir. I don't have the habit. Fine. You didn't apply for the SI exam? - I will, sir. Yes, do that. You will make it. Thank you, sir. Welcome. Sir, tender coconut? No, I'm good. Here. Give it inside. Come. These are the old case files. - Okay, sir. These are completed cases. Sit down and read all of it. - Okay, sir. I'll let you know when someone comes to file a complaint. Observe the complaint registration process. Okay, sir. I'll teach you how to handle crime information. Follow up with the inspector regarding cases and FIRs. Okay, sir. The inspector is not here. Have you met the S.I? Not yet, sir.. - Sit down and read. Don't be so anxious to stand. It's just your first day. They'll never let you stand. Thangaraj sir? The S.I summoned you. Sir. Hello, brother. How many cases are pending? I'll get the list, sir. No need, brother. It's right here. Look at this list and tell me how many cases are still pending. Two snatching cases. A few gold chains. We can clear these. Okay, brother. Get it done. - Yes, sir. Change the crime ratio to 98 percent. - Sir! Kid... - Sir? Get me the files you were reading. The ones from this month. Sir? Sir, I've got them. Pull out complaints below 5 - 6 sovereigns of gold. Okay, sir. Have you pulled them out? - Yes, sir. Call them up and summon them. - Okay, sir. Ask two of them to come now, and the rest in the evening. Okay, sir. See if there's a TVS 50. - Okay, sir. There's a Champ. No TVS 50? - No, sir. See if it's whole. When does your service end, sir? Why? You want to occupy my seat? I was just making conversation. Are you going to give them this vehicle and make them withdraw the complaint? Yes, indeed. We are lowering the crime rate. We caught a thief. He stole from your house as well. He sold all the jewellery and blew up the cash. Only this was left. Is this yours? - Take a look, dear. Sir, this is not mine. That's what he said too. Yours was 6 sovereigns, right? - Yes, sir. This must be about 3 sovereigns? Take this if you want, and withdraw your complaint. You can take it home with you right away. Kid... - Sir? Draft a complaint withdrawal letter. Or I will surrender this at the court. If you tell them it's not yours, you will get nothing. But that's not my chain... - I'm the one giving it. Take it. Tell her, don't just sit there gawking. Or you'll not get anything. Gold prices have shot up. Just take it! As long as there won't be trouble. It will be fine. Take it and leave. Is it done? - Yes, sir. Get her signature. Sign there to withdraw your complaint. Get his signature as well. - Over here. You too. Yes, tell me. Get home soon. - Okay, okay. Have you signed? Talk to me when I'm on the line. - You may leave. Thank you, sir. - Keep it safe. Get money from the ATM to pay the school fees. Okay, I will get it. - Arivu. - Sir? The missing TVS 50 case? - Yes. He will come. Get a similar statement from him. Okay, sir. He will insist on a TVS50. Make him take the Champ and leave. Subha! - I'm coming. Don't keep honking. I'm coming. - Hurry up! Hop on. Let's go. Did you take the lunch? - Oh, no. Give me a moment. I'll wait up front. You come there. Why can't you just wait? What's the hurry? You said you needed something from the town, didn't you? I'm going to the court tomorrow. I can get it for you. Why would you wear that saree when we go out? I should buy you nicer sarees. Okay, fine. I didn't notice you running scared from your wife. Happy? Just ride. Don't pluck words from my mouth. Or you'll become a laughing-stock. Ugh. Wow! Suresh, the coach said we have a match tomorrow. - Mugilan! Mugilan! Mugilan, can't you hear me? Here. What's for lunch, Ma? - Lemon rice and potatoes. Fine. Give me money for snacks. Dear, give him some money. - Here. - Be careful. Mugilan, your grandfather is a cop too? Kid, that is his father. He is a sub-inspector, you know? Sorry, aunty. I'll wait over there. Why did you bring him? You could have come alone, Ma. What's your problem? So what if he's here? Tell them he's your father. What's the big deal? Get lost, Ma. - Mugilan, wait!

What's stopping you from looking like a young groom with dark hair? Yeah, sure. I go to the court everyday.

Not again! - Fine, let's go. Hurry. Greetings, sir. Madam... We've included the police union committee documents now, madam. Who is here on behalf of the opposition? Varadan sir, tell me. There have been quite a few adjournments. Will anybody come from your end, or not? We need time, madam. We are overloaded with work. Could you please set another date? Your people don't give in easily when it comes to the matter of unionising. As if everything will be fixed once there are unions. Madam, for our political system to function efficiently... ...the virtue of the leader is paramount. We can't pick a minor loophole in law and criticise the whole institution, right? Union is a basic need. It is a necessity. Administrative problems go away with personnel change, madam. Even IPS officers have their own union. It is unfair to delay approval for our union, madam. Am I the one delaying it? Note down the date. September 22nd. Varadan sir, submit a statement for missing this hearing. Okay, madam. Next case! D3 42/19. You're really brave, sir. You are actually fighting a case for police union. The very term "police union" is new to me. I've been fighting for it from 1979. This case has been in hearing only for a while now. They've ensured that dissent doesn't even cross our minds. You try asking for an union. As long as I'm alive, I will fight. Come. Sir, the judgement copy. Sir! Hey... Come here. Get the union case file. Sir? Brother, get the union case file. Go on. So you're the leader here? Looks like you encourage him? - No, sir. Answer me! Eight-hour work day... You're full of new ideas. Mandatory leave every eighth day! Is this what you get paid to do? Answer me. Summon everyone. Hey Kolanji, come here. Assemble everyone. Brother, come. Sister, we need to assemble. Shanmugam sir, hurry up. Which of you are in solidarity with him to form a union? Shut up and do your jobs, if you want to stay. Or get lost with this mongrel. Understand? Get me that file. Give me a matchbox. Just follow your higher officials' orders. Your job here is to be a policeman, not to start a bloody revolution. Open your mouth and speak up. Must I beg you to speak? Everybody, get out of here. Get out. Just shut your hole as long as you're in service. I'm sparing you because of your age. We don't need him here. I'll get an order ready. Have him leave tomorrow. Find any old remark against him. People like him should be slapped with cases and brought under control. Get out of my sight. Go! Are you glaring at me? Sir, please don't.. Sir... - You're glaring at me? Let go! He dares to glare at me. Get out! - I'll handle it, sir. Get out! Get out! Out! - Sir, please... I don't want to see him in this station ever again. Brother, please go. - He dares to glare at 'me'. I'll kill you. Any more rats in this station? Is it my job to pluck them out? This is a first and final warning. I don't want the likes of him around here. We just returned from court. Arivu... - Sir? Come. Sit. Take care, kid. You're on your own now. Why, sir? - Getting transferred. One last transfer. Old man, union or not, you're our leader. We will definitely have a union. You must believe that. Don't draw conclusions based on what happened in there. It's nothing I haven't faced already. Don't just run off to your new station. Throw us a party! - To celebrate the earful I got? No, sir. You're getting transferred. It's not like we can track you down. My liver's been on rest for a while. - I'll whack you. Arivu... Sir, put that away! Ganesh, set the terrace up. Where is Arivu? - Over there. Arivu, come here. - Sir? I'm on the phone, sir. - I can't hear. Come here. Sir, I was on the phone, so... Do you drink, or do you not have this habit either? No thanks, sir. I'm not in a good mood. Not in a good mood? What's wrong? What is it, kid? I'm thinking of quitting my job, sir. Fine. Talk to me. In school, we were all asked to state our ambition. Even back then, I said I wanted to become a policeman and serve my country. I lost half my soul before I completed training. I thought things would be better once I joined work. All we do is fabricate witnesses, make victims retract cases... I don't like this, sir. Arivu, a long, long time ago... the police force was formed to keep our people from standing up to the whites. And it remains unchanged till date. Even after they left our country... ...the police are eager to only serve those in power. You don't need to serve the country. Use whatever power you wield and serve the people. Turn your colleagues into people with basic compassion. In the police force, anybody who is not in power is but a henchman. I am a henchman. You're a new henchman. - Sir... I believe we can bring about some change if we have our own union. Be a guardian who loves the people. That's a noble act. I spew philosophy when I'm a few drinks down. Forgive me, kid. - Come on, sir. Come, have a drink with me. "I want to quit my job", he says. Please sit, sir. Sekar had called me. He's a bit of a pain, isn't he? Such a complicated guy. I never had a problem with him. I somehow got by. Writer, is the inspector here? Check in there. So where are you staying? I came straight here. I don't know anybody here. I need to look for a dorm. Sir... I've brought the boy. Go to Venkateswara wedding hall. I have informed them. Stay there till your replacement comes. Okay, sir. Here, sign this. Head Constable Manickam will be coming there. There's a power cut. I'll get the other photocopies when power is back. Sir... Isn't that 'Grave Crime' Raja? Yes, you know him? I know him well, sir. It was the year 2012, I think... ...we convicted him for about 200 gold sovereigns of gold. He just returned everything. We had arrested him under Section 399. He begged the judge and promised to give up stealing. Judge made him stay under our station's watch for 1.5 years and set him free. Signed? You can join tomorrow morning. - Okay, sir. He stays in our station and makes a living here. Can I take Raja with me? What for? I need to look for a dorm. I will send him back soon. Okay, take him with you. There are many dorms across the road. Send him back soon. - Yes, sir. See you, sir. Hey, Raja. Yes, sir? Don't remember me? From Thiruverumbur station? I remember, sir. Tell me. Why do you act like you don't recognise me? Don't book me in any of the old cases, sir. I am a changed man. - I'll whack you! I've been transferred here. So what is it? I am a busy guy. I don't get a moment's rest. I have informed them. They won't miss you. Come with me. I need to look for a room. Just a room? Or...? - Now you're into this profession too? I'm stuck with you people. What choice do I have? Just remain seated. How did a thief from Trichy end up here? Mine is a tale of misery, Chief. Tell me, I had a son, Chief. So I made a life decision and lifted some jewellery. Then I went into hiding. My son got jaundice. I carried him around from hospital to hospital. The police were looking for me for a crime I didn't commit. But I ran my mouth and got caught for everything. They took everything from me... ...and finally did this. But you always confess to your crimes. They tried to pin every unsolved case on me. Just my luck. My son died too. Eat, Chief. Eat some 'boti'. I paid for my sins by witnessing the ruin of everybody in my life... and live in pain forever. Till the end... ...I never got to see my son's face. Don't feel bad, Chief. Eat. I need to live the rest of my life in peace. So I pleaded with the judge and started running errands here. Go. Sir, he is Thangaraj. He just got transferred here from Trichy. Sir, the punishment case... they've dumped him on us. Sir... Sir! Where is Manickam? - On duty at the wedding hall, sir. Tell him to go to the wedding hall on para-duty. - Okay, sir. Sir! Sir, come, sir. Sir, there's one Head Constable Manickam. Relieve him and start your duty, sir. Sir, how could you send me on para-duty? We are short of men here. Please go, sir. Writer, you assigned me to para-duty to haul all the kickbacks for yourself? Manickam sir. - Set aside my share. Sir! Hello. Sir, I was asked to relieve you from your shift. Oh, you are Thangaraj? - Yes, sir. Sir... just follow everything here. - Okay, sir. If you need anything else... ...call the writer. - Okay, sir. He will instruct you. - Okay, sir. Yeah, Ramesh? Call me if you need anything. Take care of him. Give me your phone number? My number is 9-8-4-1-3 4-9-4-5-3 Noted it down? He's in this room. Call me if you need anything. Okay. - Okay, sir. Tell me. - Have you reported to duty? Yes, I'm here. How's the boy? - He's fine. Take care. He's at school. Have you eaten? I'll call back. Sir! Sir! Sir... Sir, let me go. - Manager... Sir, sir... - Manager, hurry up here. Sir, let me go. Catch him! Shut the gates downstairs. - Okay, sir. Sir, sir... Sir, let me go. What are you doing? Let me go! Sir, let me go! Sir... Sir, let me go. Let me go, sir. Sir, let me go! Don't run! Sir, let me go, sir. Please, sir. Sir, I didn't do anything. Please let me go. Please, sir. Why are you doing this to me? Sir, I have done nothing wrong. Please... Sir, let me go! Stop, boy. Manager, get him. Sir, Come on. Let me go man. Sir, catch him. Stop! Let me go, man. - Get down, boy. Rascal... trying to get away? Let me go, sir. Go on. Go. Go. Go. Go. In all my years in service, I've never hit anybody. Stay put. I'll shoot you down and say that you tried to escape. Rascal. Sir, I didn't do anything. Don't tell anybody. - Of course not, sir. Make sure nobody comes downstairs. - Okay, sir. Sir, what is that case? - Which one? The one I was assigned to... with the boy. The inspector is handling it. We'll know the details only when he comes. We were told not to hold him at the station. Why are you interrogating me? No reason. I just wanted to know... Don't worry about things that are not your concern. - Okay, sir. Carry on, sir. Hello? - Yeah... The boy's holidays have begun. I'm going to my mother's house. Okay, go. How many off days? Why do you sound low? Are you drunk? No, you witch. Stop asking me that all the time. Drink yourself to death. Your only son will become a homeless orphan. Isn't that your plan? Go ahead. - Oh, woman. I hit a boy. What? You hit a boy? 'You' hit him? Yes. I feel terrible. If Amudha had had a son, he'd be this boy's age. Now I get it. You're lonely and mulling over the past. I'm sure you played romantic music and wailed along! I'm getting another call. Hang up now. You always get a second call only while talking to me. Hang up now. Hello? Sir, it's Balan Lodge, under the flyover. I'll wait outside for you. Help! Somebody, help. So, boy... - Sir? Have you eaten? Sit. Sit. What's your father's name? Sir? What's your father's name? - Ubagaram, sir. How many members in your family? I live with my elder brother, sir. My brother, his wife, his son, and I. Four of us. Why have you brought me in, sir? I'll tell you, boy. Case number 319/20. Name - Devakumar. Father's name - Ubagaram. Local address... ...here. Take it. Take it, boy. Sign there. But... ...why do you need all these details? Sir, I won't sign unless I know why. I'm scared. Why should I sign, sir? I don't understand what you're saying. Just sign. I'll handle everything. Sir, I have nothing to do with this. You'll see for yourself when my family come. Or you can call and ask them, too. Look, I'm treating you with respect... - Sir, the deputy commissioner. Sir, I'm talking to him. Who's with you? - A local constable, sir. Where is the boy from? Sir, he's from out of town. He's not a local. It happened without his knowledge, sir. Is that so? Sir, he doesn't seem to know anything. Okay, we will handle it. Don't draw attention. Get his sign before things get complicated. Find out who the notary public is. We don't want issues in the future. Take him out quietly, just like you brought him in. Don't handle him like the other suspects you hold in lodges. [SPEAKING HINDI] I'll be there soon. Handle it until then. [SPEAKING HINDI] Okay? - Yes, sir. So, have you signed? I won't sign, sir. Didn't you hear what I said? Sign. I'm scared, sir. - Just sign, you punk. Manickam, don't. Get back. - Sir, I won't sign. He asked you a question! - Why are you hitting me, sir? Get back. So you won't sign? Oh, you will. There's a North Indian coming just to make you sign. Lock the door, man. Sir, please let me out. Why are you keeping me locked in? Sir, I didn't do anything. Sir, open up. Sir, I've done nothing wrong. Let me out. Come. I was just going to call you. Talk to Manickam. Stay in the lodge tonight. Not the wedding hall from yesterday, but Balan Lodge. I'll message you the address. No, sir. Assign me to some other duty... Think this is your old station, to do as you please? Do your job until retirement. Don't start slacking already. Wait for another two months. Sir, I'll go. - Go, sir. Sir, shall I take Raja with me? You're going to a lodge. Don't draw unwanted attention. I'll make sure nothing goes wrong. What, you've become buddies? I have 80 bucks. Give me 40 more, and I'll call it a day. The liquor store will shut soon. "Become buddies", he says. Go with him. Sir. Come, let's go. Come. There's work to be done. Sir. - You are late. I have a family too, you know. You don't need to do extra work. Stick to duty timings. Take this, sir. Chief, who's the boy? What's the case? Nobody would open their mouths. No idea what the hell it is. Inspector Perumal is holding him. He must be getting evidence ready. Here, leave it there. Did you interrogate? The young man is a runner. So I had to whack him. My whole service has been about pens, typewriters, and now computers. I have never raised my hand at anyone. But he made me hit him. Tell me. Oh, he could be a while. Sit, boy. Let's have a drink. It was Lakshan's birthday party. They gave me cake. She claimed I'd catch a cold, and ate all the cake. Oh, be quiet. So what? The cake was good so I ate it. He called you to complain about me! Fool. Cut the call. She snatches food from the child! Poured me a drink? - Here, Chief. Gulp this down and soar away. Give it to me! Kid, you want a drink? Hey, I'll slaughter you. Should he suffer like me? It's like they've queued up just to annoy me. Hello. - Thangaraj, how are you? I'm fine, sir. How are things at the new station? - Kid... Here. Just gulp it down. You don't know when you'll get out of here. Seize this opportunity. You'll have to weather a lot of beatings. Never keep a drink waiting. Fine. I won't pressure you. Brother... We can publish a four-page article. "Do We Need A Police Union? A Detailed Report." That's my suggested headline. Leave it to me. Got any other scoop for me? I'm looking for a headline. If you're looking for a headline, just do the union piece. Thangaraj, we'll cover that next week. Trust me. Don't get too drunk and throw up. What is it? Chain snatching? Did I tell you that? I'm a student. PhD from Madras University. You know? Fine, how did you get here? My girlfriend invited me for fish curry, so I came down here. You're getting on my nerves! I took pity on you because you seemed soft and naive, like me. Now you are being cocky with me? Enjoy the fish curry your buddies here serve you. Brother, please get me out of this. Help me, brother. - That's more like it. So, what's your story? Kid? Kid... Why are you crying? Tell me. I come from a village called Poondi near Thirukkattupalli. I am a student. I was visiting my hometown for the village festival. You kept me waiting for ages! I don't drive the bus. Fine, let's go. - Give me the keys, I'll drive. Dude, the river is brimming with water! Yeah, man. We had good rains this year. Alright! Why is the truck in such a sorry state? I don't have the money, man. What's going on with the vegetable seller? Her name is Maheshwari, right? She got married. What are you saying? But you were in a relationship! Let it go. How long are you in town? Oh, so you won't tell me? No problem. I'll ask the boys. Only omelette for you. - Take it! Lourdhu's son! Buddy! - Look, Deva is here. How are you guys? - Hello, Ubagaram's son! How are you? - Great! Hey Shorty, doing good? - Yeah, man. Welcome. Drinking so early in the day? There is a funeral in the postmaster's house. - Who? Didn't you hear? - That old man from Madha Koil Street? Yeah, nobody gave a damn about that guy.

I'll finish my breakfast. Let's go to Trichy and buy clothes. Oh, yes. We must. All my pants have holes. My mother mocks me, calling me "Knife-Bottom". She's right about that. Oh, shut up. Okay, I'll see you soon. Sure. Uncle, hold tight. Be careful, child. I'm going to buy clothes. Give me money. To Trichy? With whom? I'm going with Selvam. Oh, no. I don't have enough money. It's time to bury the postmaster. I'll head there. Come there and get money from me? Okay, see you there. Useless, good-for-nothing boy... Why does he need new clothes? Eat and then come. Would this happen to anybody else in this world? They just want to latch on to their brother and bide their time. Worthless boy. The wretched man spends all his time in the church. And these people keeping mooching off him... ...determined to bring me and my son out to the streets. Don't injure yourself, son. If you were to get hurt, no one will pay for your hospital bills. Why are you hitting the child? - He's my child, I will hit him. He was broke then. Now they want me and my son to be homeless again. Is my nuptial thread worth anything? These people will sell that to feed themselves, too. Some brothers! Brothers like no other. Those who feed off of my hard work shall rot to dirt. Look at him walk away. Get lost! How long will you feed off of your brother? Get lost. So we pray with faith... ...just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father. We were buried therefore with Him by Baptism into death. Amen. Uncle! Uncle! Uncle Xavier. Come here. What? Uncle, Deva is leaving. Yeah, he's going to the town. The town? He's leaving for Madras. What's with him? Auntie and him got into a big fight. She yelled at him for not having a job. What can he do? He's just a student. She yelled at him after I left? Let go, I'll sort out that witch! She can't yell at him, he's a student! Why are you getting worked up? Deva is important to you, and so is Auntie. Make peace between them. How can you shout? What have you ever done for her? Have you showered her with jewellery? So she'd yell at him? I'll kill that woman. Let me go. - Don't lose your temper. Why are you getting worked up? They're both important. Make peace, don't lose it. Don't worry, boy. It will all be fine. You tell him, Mom. Stop! So that brainless witch yelled, and you stormed out? She did raise you as well. Forget about it and move on. I don't want to ruin your family. He's elder to you. Is that how you talk to him? Auntie, you don't know what you're saying. Be quiet. - Come back home and leave after the festival. Your sister is coming tomorrow, too. - Yeah, just go home. We are your parents now. Knock some sense into him. - Hey, Xavier? Load the grains into Rayappan's truck. My brother took off. - Father, bless me. Okay, you go now. I'll handle it. Father, bless us. - Bless you. What's with you? It's not the first time she's fought with you. Brush it aside. No, I will take care of myself. I don't want to burden anybody. Didn't you hear the Father? Don't raise your voice at elders. Did he toil to give you an education so you can act frosty? Answer me. Though you are from the low-caste neighbourhood... ...your caste certificate is issued based on your religion. If not, you could have got a seat reserved for scheduled castes. How long can he support you? I will educate him as long as I am well and able. Yeah. Bullshit. Deva, look for a job while you study. If you need a little help, ask me. Don't ask him. Okay? No, Father. I am leaving. You heard him. Study for as long as you can. Has anyone from your family got an education? Studying may get you into the upper-caste neighbourhood, or not. But it will uplift you. Understand? Don't be a fool like your brother. Be smart. Father, tell him to stay for the festival. He took days off just for that. No, I'm leaving. - Don't keep saying that! Don't talk back. Just listen to them. Deva... ...stay for a few days. He's pleading with you. Come. I'll deal with the foolish witch. - Let go! I'm leaving. Don't go home. Stay at the church. Okay? No, Father. I have a lot of work there. What the hell? We're all telling you not to go. Let go. Should we fall at your feet? Fine, let it go. Let's not keep a student from his duties. Here. No, Father. - Take it. Put him in a bus. I am yet to receive money from the society for the harvest. I'll send it across once I get it. It's your sister. Hello? Prabhu had called me. I heard little brother is leaving? Yes, dear. He says he's got an important interview. The festival is in two days. Why would he leave now? The girls are eager to meet their Uncle. You wretch! He has important work, should I keep him from it? Let me talk to him. - Hold on. Your sister wants to talk to you. Don't tell her about the fight. Don't want her picking a quarrel during the festival. One moment. Sis, are you well? Are the girls well? Wait for two days and see for yourself? No. I must get back to work. Okay, boy. Brother said you were going for an interview. It is a good thing if you find a job. Poor brother is struggling to hold fort all by himself. It will be good if you go to work too. Okay, you be safe. Tell Brother I'll be coming in the evening bus. I'll tell him, sis. The bus has arrived, I'm off. Keep the girls safe. The bus is here. - I'll call you, sis. She will never hang up, the witch. Call her later. Sit over here. Boy... ...don't dwell on what happened. I'm here for you, no matter what. Study well, okay? Study well. Go straight home. Don't get drunk and fight with her. You witch! I'm going to the church. "Don't get drunk." Take care. Deva, leave water for the pigeons. Yes, brother. - Don't forget. Are you Devakumar? - Yes, sir. I'm Head Constable Manickam. Your native is Thirukattupalli? - Yes, sir. Who lives with you? Me... and another guy. He's gone to Coimbatore. - We need you for verification. Come to the station. Sir, give me my phone. I'm not going to steal your phone. I don't know why they've brought me down here. Help me out, brother. Please. Did they interrogate you? Yes, the inspector came. He asked me why I needed all those details. And asked me who I lived with. He's asking me to sign a petition. Why? Did you sign it? - No. I refused to sign. Brother, please help me out. Calm down, I'm there for you. Don't be scared. I'll handle it, don't worry. Okay, sir. - Okay, then. You're always on the phone! Here, drink this. Why have you left him alone? He won't go anywhere, he's a good lad. I spoke to him, Chief. Help the poor guy, he seems innocent. As if they'd listen to me. I have 35 years of service. But they're treating me like a rookie. They tell me to ask the inspector. Like I'm scared of him. The inspector is a pain. He treats me like a leper. What then? Should he give you an award? You are just a thief. Sure, I am a thief. I don't expect awards... ...just want to be treated like a human. Sure. Even thieves will win awards if only the police would let them reform. - Sure. Most of us turn into criminals only because of the police. Go to bed before I smack you. The truth is always bitter. Boy, I felt terrible. Because I hit you. It's okay, sir. Don't be afraid, you'll be remanded tomorrow. Okay? Don't feel bad. There are good people in the police force too. Any of them alive? Hire a good lawyer, and you'll be fine. They took my cell phone, sir. They've held me here rather than the station. That scares me. Would you be happier at the station? If you want, I'll take you to the station tomorrow, okay? Go to sleep. Another drink? I'm done. Son, hit the music. [OLD ROMANTIC MOVIE SONG] Move your leg. Hey, wake up. He's still not up? You wake up first. Go to the station, I'll be right there. Take your time. I'll take this drink. Get lost. Sir. Where's Perumal? - He's gone out. He'll be here shortly. I told him to be here. He had phoned me to say he'll be here shortly. Order a coffee. Manickam... He always comes late? Sir? I need to meet you, Your Highness. Give me an appointment? Sir, I'll be there in five minutes. - Hurry up. [SPEAKING HINDI] Bring me water. Raja, come here. What is it? - Hurry up! You know where Thangaraj stays? He lives close by. Tell him the DC is here and bring him down. It's just the DC. Tell him to wait. Hurry up and call him, man. DC or PC, who cares? All of you keep troubling me. Why won't the DC wait? What's all the fuss about? Here he comes. - Sir. - Where is the DC? Inside, sir. He is angry. Have you seen this? Or are you completely unaware? I've been getting calls all morning. You can't even hold a boy discreetly? Sorry, sir. I'm just seeing this. Do you even know your job? You don't even report to work on time. How will you handle this? [SPEAKING HINDI] Look, Perumal... ...file an FIR before the issue escalates. Prepare a solid witness and evidence. What's with all the shouting? I don't know, he's pissed. The inspector is coming. Manickam, stay with the boy till I tell you to. Okay, sir. Kathiresan, what's the number? 52? 153/2019, sir. - Write that down. Hurry up. Is it done? - Sir, it's done, sir. Perumal, what happened? Sir! - Sir! Is it done? - Almost, sir. Hurry up. - In a moment, sir. Got a cigarette? Sir! Have you got cigarettes? Sir... Aren't you from Trichy? - Yes, sir. Sit down. Sit and write. Isn't Periyaiah the AC there? - Yes, sir. Sir, sign please. He's from my batch. I've seen you around. Sir! I was at the Cantonment Station. I've heard, sir. Order a coffee for Thangaraj. Sir, no thank you. Cigarette? - Sir, I don't smoke. I think it was back in 2008... ...he used to call me and tell me about you. He spoke so highly of you that I still remember your name. He's a distant relative. Is that so, sir? Is it ready? - Sir! Not 374! Perumal, get a fresh one ready. Okay, sir. Get creative with the crime scene, man. Always the same bike chase, nabbing, country bomb. Get lost! Write something new. Thangaraj, weren't you the writer at that station? Yes, sir. I even worked with Sir in two cases. Read it and make corrections. Sir, excuse me... Shut up! Read it, man. The crime scene is bad. Write it afresh. But, sir.. Just do it. Why are you still standing here? Go. Sir! Sir, what's the case? Why the hell would he make me work just to give it to you? Here, read it and go tell him. Write it yourself, sir. I will help you, sir. No thank you, sir. Write it yourself. After all, you're pals with the DC. Raja, order a tea. Sir, you should write it. He just wants a crime scene. I'll look at old case-files and cook up a crime scene. Please don't be angry. Just write it, sir. Here. - Done already? Yes, give it to him. He might yell at me. You give it to him. Come on, sir. You give it to him. Sir, come with me. Really? - Yes, let's go together. Fine. If he yells, we'll face it together. What's the crime scene? - It's in the back, sir. What's the evidence? - We have a country-made gun, sir. We can get a new variant ready, sir. Get the pistol. It's good, man. - Sir. You've written well. - Thanks, sir. Get the phone. Go get Perumal. Sir, why is he angry? Read this. Sir, he appreciated your work. That guy? Like he'd ever appreciate me. It's front page news when he cracks a smile. I'm sure he wouldn't have appreciated me. Are you trying to placate me? No, he really did appreciate you. Get to work, sir. Manickam? - Send someone soon, Writer. Don't yell, man. The inspector is shouting. Hurry up. Okay, fine. Sir, go and relieve Manickam from his shift, sir. Para-duty again? Yes, especially today. Please go. Making you work is proving to be difficult. Ask the inspector for a transfer. Besides, you're close to the DC. I'll go, sir. Sir... Have you eaten? No, sir. He just sat and ate alone! That freeloader. Wait, I'll order food for you. I don't want food, sir. Just let me go. Wait, boy. Tell me, sir. Let the boy go, sir. Really, sir? There is no documentation, though. Shall I bring him to the station? Just let him go. There is plenty of work at the station. Okay, sir. Didn't I tell you there must have been a mix up? I think they caught the actual criminal. They've asked you to leave. Can I really leave, sir? - Scram! Go. Son, here you go. I don't want money, sir. Keep it. Eat on your way back. Stay out of trouble. Sir... - What? Thank you, sir. - Come on! Thanks a lot, sir. - Okay. Yes, Raja. - Tell me. Come to this address. You can't just summon me like a prostitute. I won't come. I'm not asking you, fool. That's an order. Come to MN Lodge now. Should have just gone to prison instead. Hang up, I'm coming. Sorry, sir. You dropped something. Pick it up. I said, pick it up. Pick it up. Sir, it's not mine. - It is yours. Pick it up. It's not mine! Wait... stop! Sir, I didn't do anything. Sir, that's not my gun. Sir, please let me go. I didn't do anything. Sir, I didn't do anything. Sir, I'm a student. I didn't do anything. Tell them, sir. Help me, sir. Thangaraj sir. Look at this! Help me, sir. - Shut up! Sir, I didn't do anything. It hurts, sir. I didn't do anything, sir. Sir, let me go... Thangaraj sir. Please tell them! Help me, sir. 'Police use lodge as police station' If you're looking for a headline, you could just do the union piece. We'll cover that next week. Don't worry, leave it to me. Have you got any scoop for me? A boy has been held under illegal custody for two days now. He is being held as a preventive suspect under a different name every day. I don't even know his name. We are holding him in a lodge near the station. Okay, Thangaraj. I'll take care of this. What was the boy's name? What was the name of the lodge? If I stay on line any longer, you'll extract a confession from me. Thangaraj, weren't you the writer at that station? Chief! We can do it here, in full public view. Sir, that is not my gun. Sir! It's good, man. - Sir. You've written well. - Thanks, sir. Chief... What happened? Let's go. Sit, Chief. Sit. Round up the eye-witnesses. Did you witness the incident yesterday? - Yes, sir. You know he had a gun? - Yes, sir. Will you testify in court? - I will, sir. What's that book? It's got a sickle and a hammer... These people are such a nuisance. This should be kept in seizure mahazar. You brought it here instead! When will you ever learn the job? You are calling from the press, is it? Yeah, come to the D1 station. D1. [MUFFLED] Sir, I'm scared... Don't make a sound. Sir, please let me go. Hello, sir. I'm from Nakkeeran Magazine. Junior Vikatan had a news piece on you. I need details on that, sir. It is a false report. Let me clarify. We have a proper FIR for this case. What more details do you want? There are people always looking to slander the police. This is one such news. Do they ever write anything positive about the police? If that's the case, let us know. It's our job to write about it. We will focus on it. A1... - Devakumar, sir. Yes, Devakumar. We have filed a case under UAPA. We've arrested him with weapons under Unlawful Activities. The basis for this operation was the Jan 2019 SBCID report on Naxal activities. Team, please assemble. The accused was staying in that lodge. We organized a special team. Manickam, head constable. Thangaraj, head constable. Perumal, inspector in charge. It was team work. Two days of surveillance, then attack. The interrogation is on-going. I can't disclose further details. Another important thing... ...publish authentic news. Please let us do our jobs. You do your job, and let us do ours. No further comments. Go and handle them. - Let us take a photo of the guy. Sir, give us some details about him. Sir, the judge asked you to meet him at his house. Go straight to his house. You know where it is? I do, madam. The DC is here. We've been waiting for a long time. He will yell at me. Can't you do something? Shall I tell the judge the DC is waiting? No thanks. I'll handle it. I'll see you, sir. Why can't he clear it here? [HINDI] This case is killing me. Okay, take him and leave. Let's not remand him. Ask him for at least three days to interrogate him. Keep me posted. Thangaraj, you are experienced. Keep an eye on him. Come on. I need to meet the judge. - Wait, I'll inform him. Sir! Suspect with arms, 1917. We've got the SB CID report. Clear case of Naxal influence, sir. I'll read it myself. Please wait. You can remand him. - Sir! What's your name? Devakumar, sir. Did they hit you? Did they threaten you? Open your mouth and speak up. Do you know your charges? No, I don't know, sir. What is this? - Sir, well... You just bring him here without any homework! You could have prepared him before bringing him here. I have to follow protocol, after all. The police say you underwent Naxal training. It's a lie, sir. Please run a background check, sir. I don't know anything. I'm a college student. They took me in and forced me to confess. You can't create a scene here. You can hire a lawyer if you want. If you need legal help, file a petition. You'll remain under remand for 15 days. - Please, sir. Sir, we need time to interrogate him. The investigation is not over. If you could grant five days... Five days? No way. You can interrogate him for 2 days. - I'm not a Naxal. Bring him back in the same condition. Present him at court after the interrogation. Sir, I don't know anything. Help me. Take this. - Please. Son, don't shout here. Take him away. Hello? - Sir... Tell me. - Good news, sir. The judge remanded him for 15 days. You moron. How is this good news? No, sir. That's what he initially said... ...but after I negotiated with him, he granted us 2 days. Fine, bring him to the station. I'll come there. Be careful. Try to identify the source of the news leak. - Okay, sir. Don't loiter around till the case is done. - Won't you shut up? Okay, sir. Have you no brains? Can't you see I was on the phone? Don't hit him outside the judge's house. Get him in. - Go on! Sir... Sir... Sir, I won't say anything. Thangaraj, over here. That really blew up, sir. Thanks to you, I can't sleep now even if I drink. The illegal custody? - Yes. Just say the word, I'll publish another article with the headline... "Police tyranny in Tamil Nadu Human Rights at peril." Shall I? - No thanks! If you hadn't published it, they might have let the guy go. Thangaraj, don't brood over the past. Have a drink. I'll do everything in my power to help you. I'm in a good mood now. Relax. Who is this new partner of yours? Sir, I am Raja Rajan. SI, SB-CID. Thangaraj was in a bad mood. So we decided to come out. Don't you drink? - Of course... I've got a drink here. Nevertheless, thank you. Cheers, sir. Sir, I am off. I can't take it. Thangaraj, I'm always here for you. We can even escalate it. Call me later. Relax now. Have a drink. No thanks. I am leaving. I'm leaving, sir. SI sir. Let's leave? Nice meeting you, sir. Hello? Hello... Hello, Amudha? These stupid speakers! Amudha, can you hear me? I can hear you. What is it? Amudha, are you doing well? How are you? Oh? You have the time to think about me? I deserve this and more, Amudha! Slap me if I interrupt you. My heart feels so heavy. Remember how I used to cry when I'd just joined duty? I even wanted to quit. Do you remember? I feel the exact same way today. My conscience is killing me. A boy of about 24 years... ...the police caught him. I am partly responsible. If we'd had a son, he'd be about the same age. Life has always been unkind to me when it comes to a child. Don't cry. Amudha... - I said, don't cry. You called me out of the blue. And now you're just lamenting my name. The child is asleep. You'll wake him up. Okay, I'll hang up. Don't drink too much. Go to bed. Let's talk later. Now that I've let it all out, I'll sleep peacefully now. Take good care of our son. Chief, play some music. I can't fall asleep. If I had a wife and son, I wouldn't need music to fall asleep. So you won't sleep unless there's music? Sir, the writer? Sir... - Sir, hello. We were summoned. We are from Thirukkattupalli. This is Devakumar's brother. - I'm Xavier, sir. Sit. I'll be back. Sir? Someone from the boy's family is here. Who is it? - His brother, sir. Ask him to come. - Okay, sir. Sir... What is your name? Xavier, sir. Who is he? - I'm Selvam, their relative. Sir, whatever crime he committed, big or small, please forgive him. He needs to complete his education to set an example to the other kids. We'll tell the children, "Study and be like your uncle." He is a good kid, sir. He will agree to all your conditions. Please let him go, sir. - He's been charged with serious offense. Actually, you need to be interrogated, to rule out your involvement. Please do, sir. Hold me here for two days and interrogate me. But he is a student. Please free him, sir. Don't you get what I'm saying? Thangaraj... Thangaraj! Take him away. - Greetings, sir. Give him the case details. Go. - Come. Listen to me. Is he your brother? Yes, sir. He is in big trouble. I'll give you a lawyer's number. Go and meet him. Here you go. Sir, we will pay you instead of hiring a lawyer. We can negotiate a price. This guy will land you in trouble. It is a serious offense. He needs to be surrendered in court in two days. Meet this lawyer and save your brother. You are scaring me. That horrible woman kept picking on the poor boy. If he had just stayed back, none of this would have happened. My brother's life is ruined. - Lift him up. Lift him up. - Get up! I won't leave without my brother. - Get up! Come on, Xavier. What are you doing? I beg you. Please help me out, sir. Get up. Xavier... - Look here. Go and meet the lawyer. It will be fine. Go on. Let me please see him once? They won't allow you. - I can't get him out of my mind. They will allow you to meet him only if you come with a lawyer. Take him. Go. Come on, Xavier. Don't cry. - Take care of him. Sir, he came here to study. - Let's go meet the lawyer. Who was that, Chief? Why is he crying so hard? Devakumar's brother. Thangaraj told me everything. We need to move for bail. Do you have his educational certificate? What does he study? - How would I know, sir? He said his name will be prefixed with "Doctor" once he completes this course. That is all I know. Medical college? - No, sir. You know the big college next to Anna Memorial? MGR and Kalaignar used the prefix "Doctor" before their names, right? He said it was that kind of a doctor. Just like them, he is destined to do great things. Madras University? That's the one. Sir, I can manage about 25 grand. Please get him out somehow. Money isn't the issue here. They've charged him for possession of a country-made gun... ...and undergoing Naxalite training. It's very difficult to obtain bail. Sir, don't say that or he'll start crying. When did you last see him? Sir, they didn't allow me to meet him. Sir, he is not the sort of boy who'd keep a gun. Yes, sir? What is this? They don't have proper details. Either, give me the FIR copy. Or give me the charge-sheet copy. Or I need to talk to the boy. Did you talk to him? - No, sir. He is under the DC's control. They won't allow me near him. Fine, we can talk to him through his brother. Sir, please try to get bail somehow. I'm caught in this terrible situation right before I'm about to retire. Okay, don't worry. I'll bring his brother along. Let's talk in person. Good morning, sir. - Good morning, sir. Here's my card. Give me the petition. Have a seat, sir. Sir, I am Devakumar's legal advisor. Sir, this is fine... ...he's been booked under National Security Act. UAPA. You know what that means. We can't allow it without the inspector's permission. Why don't you come after 6 o clock? Why can't we see him, sir? Fine, put that down in a written statement. I'll proceed legally. Sir, I can't give a statement. Come back and talk to the inspector. Sir, I can't just leave. Talk to the inspector right away. Or give me his number. I'll talk to him. Be reasonable, sir. - Go and talk to him. Wait here, sir. Give me that. A lawyer? - Yes, sir. A senior lawyer. The DC is being a pain. Couldn't he have taken him to some other station? I'll meet the DC and talk to him. Handle him till I get there. They insist on meeting him. Or they want it in writing. Kathiresan, handle them. On the one hand, there's the DC, on the other, you keep complaining. Fine, sir. I'll handle it. Handle them. I'll be there in an hour - Okay, sir. What? - Take this... I'll tell them, sir. Okay. Sir, I spoke to him. He said he'll be here in two hours. Please wait and meet him. He prefers that too. Sir, I don't care what he said, or when he is coming. It doesn't matter to us. We want to meet him. I'm getting suspicious now. How can you produce him at court without informing the guardian? Sir, his brother didn't cooperate during the interrogation. Let the court decide that. Sir, please try to understand. I can't overstep the inspector. If you talk to him directly, he'd say the same thing. Just two hours, sir. He is a good man. Catechist, he is a top quality lawyer. We will definitely get Deva out. I finally feel hopeful. True, Selvam. Your people are being very secretive. Yes, sir. They are being cautious since the news leaked. Let me know when the inspector arrives. I'll be waiting in my office. Okay? I'll hang up. Sir! Clear the cell. Get out. Give me that. Sign this. Don't overthink. It's just a formality. Sign here. Sir, why should I sign? Why did you arrest me? What was my crime? Give me all the case details, sir. Sir, don't... - Think you're a hotshot lawyer? I tell you to sign and you dare ask questions? Sir, don't hit me. - Your brother is outside. If you want to see him, sign here. I won't sign, sir. Sir, my brother is here. Please ask him. Sir, please fetch him. Why did you ask for those details? What do you intend to do? - What details, sir? Sir, I don't understand anything. What was the need to apply for an RTI? Who are your co-conspirators? Tell me. There is news about you in the press. A High Court lawyer has come to represent you. How does a boy from Thirukkattupalli have so much influence? I didn't apply for the RTI. Believe me, sir. Sign those papers, and I'll get you released after 15 days of remand. There will be no problems. - I won't. I didn't do anything. Fine, I filed for the RTI. What about it? Sir, you don't have the right to hit me. Perumal, get me cigarettes. Go get cigarettes. Also get some water. Clean it up. Sir, please hurry up. The boy is in trouble. The inspector and the DC are interrogating him. - I'm on my way. Give him water. Drink some water. Just do as they tell you. The lawyer can change the statement in the court. Your brother is here. Don't get beaten to death. Just co-operate. Drink some water. Just agree. I didn't do anything wrong. Please help me. Sir, help me. Just agree to it. Sir... Sir, please help me. Sir! Sir, call the inspector. I need to talk to him. I asked you to come after two hours! Sir, I know what's going on. The inspector is inside. Call him. Let me talk to him in person. Sir, please. Call him now. Sir, be seated. Sir, they are creating a ruckus. His brother, the lawyer, there is a whole party here. What do they want? - They insist on seeing the boy. Perumal, go and see them. Yes, sir? What do you want? Did you give them a copy of the FIR? - I will, sir. Then what? Then what's the problem, sir? We need to meet him, sir. We want to proceed legally. For which we must talk to him. No chance, sir. The investigation is still pending. Give them a copy of the FIR. I will, sir. - Take it from him. Get a permission letter from the court, and maybe you can see him. At least allow his brother to meet him. I don't think we need a court petition for that. Sir, let me see him just once. Manickam, take him in and interrogate him too. Get the formalities done. Sir, you can either wait, or leave. We will interrogate him, before taking him to meet Deva. Go on. Don't be afraid. Tell him to stay strong. Tell him not to fear the police. Take him away. - Go on. Hang in there. We will bail him out somehow. Leave it to me. You don't have to go through all this. Talk to your brother, and get him to confess. He can carry on with the group. But get him to work for the police. He just needs to give us information. I'll talk to the inspector and make sure he doesn't face any trouble. What do you say? Sir, what group? Cut the act. You don't know anything? I'm sure your entire family underwent Naxalite training. Sir, I swear on Poondi Madha, I don't know what you mean. Your brother is with this group, right? He underwent firearms training. Do I need to spell it out? He is working against the government. Let me say it again... ...tell him to turn informer. I'll get him released immediately. Go and see him. Deva, are you doing okay? Mate! The things they said... I don't understand anything. Oh, no! Selvam, look how badly they've beat up our innocent boy! Look what they've done to him. - Stop lamenting! Mate, we've got a lawyer. He will handle it. Just agree to everything for now. We can deny it at the court, okay? The court is filled with our people. Yes. You didn't do anything. It's okay. Everything is going to be fine. Let's go to Velankanni and pray to Mother Mary. Don't worry. I will do whatever it takes to get you out. I will get you out. I sent my brother to get an education, and look where they've made me meet him. Did you bring him here just to lament? Take him away. Take him away! You've never seen our father. You are just like him! I didn't raise you just to see you in such a state. Xavier, I thought you'd comfort him. But you are weeping like a kid. Look at my little brother! Did I send you to Madras to study to see you like this? Look how badly they've beaten him up. - Get up now! I won't leave him here. - Get up, Xavier. Look what they've done to him. - Come on. The lawyer will take care of it. - They thrashed my boy. Mother Mary, look what they've done to my boy. Don't create a scene here. Don't hit him, sir. He has low tolerance for pain. It's not like I want to! I'll buy him good biriyani. Give me money for that. Get him good food, sir. You've given me money. I'll take care of it. Please take care of him, sir. Leave now. - He is a student, sir. Sit. Why are you risking your neck? They've framed such a solid case. Your colleagues have come up with a fresh crime scene too. I wrote it with them. What? Yes. Everything is spiralling out of my control. I'd have washed my hands off this mess, and retired peacefully. But I got involved in his life for no good reason. Please save him before things go south. If we begin by arguing that he doesn't have prior records... ...there is a good chance we'll make bail. No, sir. They spoke to the manager at the petrol bunk. He will testify that the boy threatened him for money. They've fabricated three petty cases, too. - You were in on this all along. Do you take me for a fool? I only wrote the crime scene. "Only wrote the crime scene?" So you weren't able to find their motive? I don't know. I was a bit careless. They aren't letting me anywhere near him. Unless we talk to him, we won't find any clues. His brother is of no use. I will try. Please don't give up. For two years, they kept trying to find me. I gave them the slip. Have you seen Raja? I think I saw him back there. When I got out of prison, I'd pick a quarrel with someone. They'd book me under a petty case. And I'd lead a happy life in prison. Chief? - Come here. I'm coming. The boy is in there. Give him this phone while you serve food. No one will suspect you. No way! How about a laptop, Bluetooth speakers, or headphones? I can sneak those in too. I don't trust policemen. Get lost. Do as you are told. You are going overboard. - Don't be rude to me. Our people take such pride in the ability to cuss. You were asking for it. Just give him this phone. Tell him to call the lawyer. Go. Well, they will never suspect me. I'll put on a straight face. But you are new to this. What if we get caught? My life is good now. Just go! Manickam, I just made a small error in writing the crime scene. The DC... The shopkeeper wanted his old dues. At least settle his dues. I will. I'll serve food at the cell. - Leave it here. Why trouble yourself? I could do it. Don't annoy me. Just go. There's extra tamarind rice for him. Don't look at me like you've got the hots for me! You'll get me caught. This isn't working. Where did you get your training? Who gawks that way in a police station? Raja, someone threw up in the cell. Come and clean it up. Go on, I'll come. Go, give it to him. Eww! Is it vomit or diarrhoea? It stinks so bad. Watch my legs. Stand outside the gate. Don't want puke splashing over your head. The things they make me do! Get out, man. Must I tell you personally? I'm not putting on a show here. Go out. Get out, man. The bald oaf will be back any moment. Get up. It's me, Raja. Wake up! Thangaraj sent you this cell phone. It's got the lawyer's number. Talk to him. Hurry up! They might return. Hello? Devakumar? I am your lawyer. Tell me exactly what the police asked you. Who are you, sir? Why should I talk to you? It's me. It's your brother. He is our lawyer. Tell him exactly what happened there. Don't be scared. They asked me why I needed those details. They asked me who applied for the RTI. What did they ask you? Did you apply for an RTI? Sir, I don't even know what an RTI is. I am doing my PhD in the Sociology Department. I needed some details to complete my thesis. I'd consulted a lawyer called Anwar. Who is this lawyer? Do you have his number? No, sir. It's all in my phone. Where did you meet him? At the Saidapet Court. At Saidapet Court? - Yes, sir. Why did you meet Anwar? What's going on? - Give me details. Let me finish up here. Give me details about your PhD. Give me the phone. He is here. Hello? Hello, Devakumar? Sir, what happened? Devakumar? The call got cut. Sir, you had requestion information... ...regarding the article about your station? The news was leaked by someone who was on duty at the lodge. A senior reporter from Trichy had reported it. Someone from the station gave him the tip-off. Sir, this write-up was leaked from our station. It must have been whoever was on para-duty. Wasn't Thangaraj on para-duty? Where is he? Sir, he hasn't come yet. Go and fetch Raja. He will be here. Tell Raja to come. Sir, I've told him. Sir, Raja isn't here. What is it? It's nothing. Order some tea. Okay, sir. Sir! Yes, sir. He was assigned to para-duty at the lodge. You stupid idiots. The union strike that started in '79? It was Britto and him who initiated it. Sir, he's got major links to communist party people. The old commissioner had him transferred near Trichy. He was there for a long time. He's here on punishment transfer. You were aware of all this when you assigned him to para-duty? Sir, it was you.. Stop joking around! Sir, he knows all the details. It was him supporting the boy all along. All of us will get in trouble. - You're saying that now? [HINDI] You bloody clowns. What the hell are you doing out here? It took you so long to figure out that one of us was working against us? No sir, it isn't... - Shut up! Don't say a word, idiot. Get out. Get out! Sir, Thangaraj has started a WhatsApp group for the union. This is my friend Thangaraj from D1 Police Station. You know Anwar, the notary public? I need to meet him. Do you know Devakumar? A PhD scholar in Madras University? Devakumar? - Yes... Is there a problem, sir? Well, he is currently under police custody. Why? What happened? The police have filed a case against him for anti-national activities. Can I know what information he wanted? This is what he wanted. He requested certain statistics about the police department. He said he's researching mental health in the police work force. We requested the information under Right to Information Act. It's been about 15 days. By now the documents should have reached his residence. Why, is there a problem? Can I be of help? You've done enough. If I need help, I'll call you. I'll take this. - Okay, sir. Bye, see you. - Thanks. I'll study this paper and see if I can get any details at his university. Go to the station, okay? Call me if something comes up. Let's go. See you. He said, "Get me a job. I'm considering quitting PhD." I scolded him, and advised him against it. My brother is struggling back home. I want to earn money to support him. If money is the problem, I can arrange for it. You should study. What's the problem? You must continue, no matter what. Sir... You must study! Okay? - Okay, sir. I forced him to continue. I even arranged for a part-time job. He is a bright student. He is in deep trouble. I just got the full picture. We know that, sir. What is it? It's your fault this issue has blown up. This is the list of police personnel who committed suicide while in service. It's an ongoing issue. So Devakumar started doing his PhD on this subject. Vadivel Kumaran, Senthilvel, Saranya. This is a list of the dead. To be more specific, death by suicide. 'Tamil Nadu ranks 2nd in number of police suicides' 'Police lives matter' 'When will a police union be established?' 'Lady cop humiliated by colleague; Commits suicide by consuming poison' To get more information about the dead... ...Devakumar went to Anwar in Saidapet. This guy normally charges 500 rupees for an affidavit. He took 1,200 rupees from him and applied for an RTI. It wasn't such a big deal... ...because nobody cares about RTI. Meanwhile, many reforms were already implemented. Why did DC Trivedi Sharma get involved in this case? This is where it gets interesting. Saranya, who died last year... 'Saranya, a young policewoman dies by suicide' Sir, it's been two months since I applied. I've not been contacted yet. Did you apply? Yes, sir. What is your name? - Saranya. Saranya... How did you learn to ride a horse? We had horses, sir. So I learned to ride them. Oh, are you royalty then? Not at all, sir. My father had a horse carriage. I learned to ride horses in my childhood, sir. You said you owned horses, so I thought you might be royalty! Not at all, sir. - Fine. What did you say your name was? - Saranya, sir. Saranya... it's not on the list. Ganapathy sir, shall I leave? Wait, I'll come too. - Okay, sir. Your name is not on this list. The DC finalizes the riders' list. I'll hand over your form to him. Why don't you come and see me in two days? - Okay, sir. Sir! What are you doing here? I was looking at the riders' list, sir. I already shortlisted the names. Yes, sir. A girl called Saranya had submitted a request to join as a rider, sir. To ride with you? - No, sir. To join our horse unit. Tell her to apply. Sir, she has already applied. - Pull it out. This is her form, sir. You'll find two other applications there. Pull them out too. Sir! Reject all these forms. I already rejected them. Sir, she is a good rider. Oh, yeah? Then take her on a ride. Sorry, sir. Sir, want a horse ride? How about you, brother? The image of policewoman Saranya riding a horse at Marina Beach in her uniform... ...has gone viral and is trending. Many criticised the policewoman for neglecting her duty and going on a joy ride... ...as it will lead people to view the force with disrespect. Are you Saranya? - Yes, sir. You have no sense of discipline? You rode a horse at the beach in your uniform? Shall I sign you up for a circus? Did you think you joined the police or... Sir, I know horse riding. I'd even told him I wanted to sign up as a rider. So that's why you exhibited your skills to make it to the news? No, sir. I rode the horse because I knew how. Shut up, miss. Don't talk back. Sorry, sir. So you want to join here, eh? Yes, sir. Assign her to maintenance. Let her pick horse dung for six months. Pick all the dung you can, and get the hell out. Don't ever mention being a bloody rider again. What is with these broads? They are so keen to mount horses. Take her away. Until I say otherwise, maintaining these horses is your responsibility. Bathe them, feed them, and clean their dung. Get it? Sir, I'm a rider too. Why shouldn't I ride horses? He has rejected three people including you. The only common factor among the three of you... ...is the caste certificate. After he saw your certificate... ...he was determined to never to let you ride a horse. Either he should change... ...or you should give up your wish to ride horses. Take care. Go and pick dung now. Go on. Why are you doing this to yourself? The horse is an integral part of my life. When I saw that horse, I was reminded of my father. That's why I rode it. Fine, forget it. Give it a few days and try talking to the DC again. When his anger subsides, he'll change his mind. Why should I talk to him? I won't. Fool! Just because you can ride well, you think they'll take you in the squad? Why not? He rejected me on the basis of my caste. The inspector told me. That's how things have been since my father's time as a cop. Don't you know how the department functions? Don't act like this is new. To hell with the department. Fine, calm down. The DC's car is coming. Let's him pass, then we'll talk. You arrogant mongrel! Won't do the job assigned to you? [HINDI] You will never learn. Won't you do your job? - No, I won't. I won't do it. What can you do? You are dead, woman! [HINDI] You dare raise your hand at me? Picking dung is not a dirty job. But if you tell me that's my place, I will not do it. [HINDI] You will never learn. You will never learn. You people want horses for your weddings, do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? I won't even let men from your caste to ride horses. You are just a bloody woman, and you want to ride horses? You dare to ride horses? Finally, the girl committed suicide. At least that's how they closed the case. But the ghost returned in Devakumar's form... ...and they nabbed him. They'd have made him sign a statement and let him go... ...but since the news got leaked to the press... ...the DC panicked. A total of 372 RTI activists have died so far. You can add Devakumar to the list. Though he knows nothing. Sir, we must save him somehow. It's difficult to save him while he is held here. Let's get it cleared at the court with his certificates, residence, and other details. We can argue that it was a framed case. No, sir. It's not that easy. They held him unofficially, outside the station, right? Yes. Let's do the same thing. It's my fault he got caught. I will save him. Give me your phone. Arivu, it's me. Hello, sir. I was meaning to call you, I'm glad you called. How are you? - I am good. I need a small favour. Yes, sir? Does your family need money? No, Arivu. Listen to me carefully. Case no 37/2019... - Yes, sir. Checking. Yes, sir. 37/2019... I've got the file. It's an assault case, right? - Yes, sir. "Family dispute involving Mahendran and relatives." Does it say, "Unidentified assailant engaged in assault?" Yes, sir. Replace it with what I say, and include it in the file. Sir, what are you saying? Are you okay? I'm in a crisis situation. If you trust me, just do as I say. Do you trust me? - I trust you, sir. Tell me, sir. "Xavier, S/O Ubagaram, aged 49, resident of North Street, Thirukkaattupalli." "Devakumar, C/O Xavier, engaged in heavy drinking on the 27th..." "And committed assault in Burma Colony, Thiruverumbur." Include this in the case file. Get a car tonight and come to Chengalpet toll gate. I'll send a boy called Devakumar. Present him to the inspector and surrender him directly at the court. Please get him remanded tomorrow. I'll stand by you, okay? Sir, this sounds serious. I'm scared. Don't be scared. Just trust me. It's for a good cause. I'll do it, sir. Inform the station, get a car, and come to the toll gate. I'll send him with a man called Raja, okay? Okay, sir. - Please handle this. Okay, sir. I'll be there. You are blowing this up. May I say something? You are taking a huge risk. If my guess is right, they will try to kill him. We need to rescue him tomorrow. Manickam will be taking him to the court. I'll save him, sir. I will save him. I'll see you. Sir! You've been assigned to court duty. But I don't have a vehicle, sir. It's okay. Take the police jeep. Yes, dear? I just crossed Perambalur. Oh, okay. We know you had a deal with Thangaraj. Spit out the truth to the inspector. Sir, I'm just minding my business. I want to spend the rest of my days in peace. Let me be. I don't differentiate between you and Thangaraj. Policemen are all the same to me. Shall I get some tea? I have plenty of work to do. Sir, Thangaraj has been assigned to court duty. Okay. Let's go? Be seated. I'll get the ledger and be back. Don't run! Don't run. Listen to me. Don't run. Don't run. Let go of me. Let me go. Let go of me. Let go. Sir, let go of me. Where do you think you are going? Sir, let me go. I don't trust you. Where are you running away? - I don't trust you, sir. Sir, I paid dearly for trusting you. - Just come. Sir, please. I don't trust you. Let go of me. - Come! I don't trust any policeman. Please let me go. Look at me! Trust me. Trust me! You don't have a choice, do you? Listen to me. Come with me. Where is he? - Not over here. Let me go, sir. Climb up. Sit. Look at me. I know all about you. We are risking everything to save you. Stop running away, fool. Do you want me to die with you? I'm talking to you. I'm talking to you! Look at me. Do you even know what's happening around you? He said he is researching mental health in police work force. We requested for the information through Right To Information Act. Now do you understand why we are running? Look at me. Just go with my friend. Why do such things happen to me? You'll be fine. Stay strong. Stay strong. - I won't go, sir. Come, let's go. Come on, let's go. Where is he? - Don't know, sir. Come on. Auto... Here, take this. Go, go, go. Take this. Call Arivazhagan. Go, go, go. - Sir, come with me. Take this money. - Sir, please come along. Go! Go! FEW MONTHS LATER... What have you done? Look what you've done to not one, but two women. Why did you have to do this? Don't other policemen just mind their jobs? Why did you have to act like a hero? What will you say to him? Shut up. Let me be in peace at least in here. I am the one ruining your peace? I said, shut up. Go over there. Amudha, both of you should never come here. Go away. Don't ever bring the boy here. Until he is old enough to come and visit me by himself... ...no one comes here, okay? You should study well, son. Go. Take care, Amudha. Okay, get going. Be strong. I'll take care. Arivu... Sir! I've written a letter to Zakir at the tea shop outside. Read it. - Okay, sir. Are you doing well, sir? Take care, sir. - I will. Are you doing well? - Yes, sir. Raja... - Chief! For the first time, you're on the other side and I'm here. Get going. Arivu, right after I sent Devakumar to meet you... ...I was just about to call and inform you. Sit down. - I'm okay, sir. Any other injuries? No, sir. You finally managed to lose the boy. Are you happy now? Who has gone after him? - Manickam, sir. Did he trace him? - Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. I tried my best. Give me an excuse only when I ask for one, Thangaraj. Sorry, sir. Thangaraj, if a case is filed, you won't even get pension, right? Yes, sir. The kind of problems you face so close to retirement! Who assigned an old man like you to court duty? Perumal, was this your idea? - Sir... I'm sure it was you. Sir, there was no one else at the station. What about you? Even you are never at the station. Thangaraj, don't worry. I'll take care. Okay, sir. Thangaraj, come on. Come. It all happened so fast, eh? Sir, I have much to accomplish. I've just started living my life. Please, sir. I won't say anything. I'll just mind my own business. Please, sir. - No, boy... There are some who wish to save you. It will become a problem for me. I have no other choice. Thangaraj... see, he got caught. You will get your pension, PF... you are one lucky guy. You have Manickam to thank for that. Thagaraj, come closer. Thangaraj, what are you thinking? Come here. Please let me go, sir. Shoot him. Finish him off. I won't say anything, sir. Give him the pistol. - I won't say anything, sir. Sir, please don't do this. Sir, I haven't done anything... Sir, please don't do it. Spare me, sir. Sir, please don't... - Shoot him. No one gets such an opportunity just before retirement. Shoot him. - Sir, don't. Please spare me, I won't say anything. Please consider me your son and spare me, sir. Why shouldn't I live, sir? Please, sir. I'm human, too. Sir, don't... Please don't... Sir, I never did anything wrong. Why should I die? Sir, I can't do it. - Oh, come on. Shoot him! - Why should I die for no crime? Sir, for most of my service period, I've been a writer. It's been a long time. My hands are shaking. It's very easy. - Sir, I'm innocent. Look here. Sir, I haven't done anything. Take aim. Sir, please don't... Sir, please don't! - And...

Another generation of Xavier's family will remain uneducated. It distressed me to think that I played a part in it. While I still hadn't recovered from the guilt and depression... ...I was assigned the task of closing Devakumar's case. Did you talk to him? - No, sir. I was waiting for you. Look, Thangaraj... Let's close Devakumar's case. I want your co-operation. Yeah? The boy escaped, understand? His gang attacked you and he escaped. Perumal, isn't that what you wrote? - Yes, sir. Play along. I shot him. The boy died. He collapsed. Talk to him. Don't be so stupid! You'll get us all in trouble. You were the one who shot him. It's not like you don't know how to write cases! Come and close the case. I shot him. What is he blabbering? I will surrender at the court. Have you gone mad or what? Stop talking like a lunatic. I can't live with the guilt. So?

Everyone who fought for a police union was transferred to remote locations. They were silenced with menial jobs at the police station. Including me. Twenty years just flew by. After that, no one who joined the police thought they should demand for an union. With a few exceptions. There are associations for apartments with fifteen flats. They try to resolve their own problems. There are many organizations like ours without unions. If we unite, we will become a powerful voice for the people. That's the power of unions. To the public, police are the face of the government, and power centres. It's people like you and I who are in direct contact with the public. Those without authority. Murders like that of Devakumar and Saranya must not become a recurring story. We need policemen who want to fight it. The least we can do is become policemen who love people. You once asked me what I'd do after my retirement. I'd have volunteered to teach at the training academy. "New recruits like you are instruments of the government." "So if someone is deemed by the police system as an outsider..." "...take a moment to question if the system is targetting our people." That would have been my lesson to the recruits. It's your turn now I can't do it any more. You should make an effort. I believe you can bring change. The hearing for the union takes place tomorrow. Maruthamuthu has the details. Go.
