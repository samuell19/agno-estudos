Bedtime, girls. Julia Thistlewaite, Selina Dalton, that means you too. Be quiet! Come along now, young ladies. Do not dawdle. Now, it's right together. Left together. And repeat. Keeping your head in books all day will not create the marriageable mind. I have nothing materially to offer a husband anyway. And I have no loving father to make me a match. A right pair we make. Oh, Selina, I'm in agony over our parting. You must promise to write to me every week. I promise. Will you write to me every week as well? I will try, but I cannot guarantee a regular correspondence. Once I'm out in society, I will be far too busy. And you really think I can visit you in London one day? Of course. After I've fallen in love and made myself a proper match, then I shall find you a husband. We will always look out for one another, dear Selina. Candles out, girls! Oh, Selina, do not be such a namby-pamby. Good morning. Oh, Miss. Quite the beauty. Now, which headdress? Mmm... the feathers. The biggest catch of the season in the year of our Lord 1818 was the Honorable Jeremy Malcolm. 'Twas true he had no title of his own and was only a younger son of an earl, but his maternal aunt had left him the bulk of her sizable fortune and a large country estate in Kent. I heard he was out with Emilia James last. But tonight, I heard Julia Thistlewaite. Mr. Malcolm was searching for a bride. But not just any bride. And he wouldn't be seduced by fine eyes or a flirtatious smile. It's Mr. Malcolm. Twenty thousand a year. He had no interest in social climbers or fortune hunters. Mr. Malcolm was a kind man who possessed an outward reserve that concealed a warm heart, a heart he was eager to bestow upon the appropriate young lady. In fact, he had set upon a unique way of pursuing true love that was beginning to earn him quite the reputation. It's Julia Thistlewaite. ♪ La la lalera ♪ Julia Thistlewaite with Mr. Malcolm. It would be the match of the season. Hasn't she been out in society for, what, four seasons? It may be time to think about stepping aside and allowing the younger ladies have their chance. He gave up his seat for me once. I nearly swooned. ♪ La la la la la la A te fortuna, a te fortuna ♪ I do wonder why they make so many foreign operas. We are in England, after all. Do you not agree, Mr. Malcolm? Are you not a fan of Rossini, Miss Thistlewaite? Is he the short, stout man? No, no. He's the composer. Oh. How silly of me. You must think me quite ignorant. No, not at all. Perhaps you are better informed on other matters. Tell me, what opinion do you hold on the Corn Laws? -The Corn Laws? -Yes. Uh, let me think. The Corn Laws. Why, I am for them, of course. - Really? - Mmm. And why is that, if I may ask? Well, I-- I believe that, um... restraint in one's diet is bound to have a healthful effect. ♪ Sono il factotum della città ♪ It's a pity you're not able to speak on the parliamentary floor. Your... views could change the face of politics. Or its figure, at any rate. Do you see he is yawning? How embarrassing. Slow down! You have a caller. Again. But I am not accepting callers. Well, I know that. But try telling that to someone who thinks he knows more than the whole of England. Oh, Mama. Hmm. Ah. Mr. Woodbury. So kind of you to call. And so frequently, too. Miss Dalton. My father is out visiting the parish's sick, as he does every Tuesday. I do not believe it would be improper to dispense with his chaperonage this once, Miss Dalton. I was emboldened to approach you knowing that with the recent unfortunate demise of your employer, you have been cast into this world without fortune or prospects. I realize that I may be your senior by, well, a few years, but I have always felt that a woman would benefit from a more mature companion, one who can give her guidance in life. Like a father, you mean? You jest, Miss Dalton. Or, um... Selina, if I may be so bold. You must know how ardently I admire you and how... It is my fondest desire to have you-- as my wife. I am greatly honored by your offer, but I cannot accept. Oh. Oh. Do not be so hasty, Miss Dalton. 'Tis common knowledge your father is of modest means, and you are but one of his many offspring. I am prepared to assist them if you wed me. But if you refuse, well, your prospects will be very grim, indeed. Hmm. Well, it is true that my family situation weighs heavily on me, but I still must refuse your kind offer. I find such an attitude incomprehensible. I must warn you, this offer will not be extended a second time. Third actually. I understand and fully accept the consequences of my decision. And now, I must beg you to please excuse me. I... Goodbye, Mr. Woodbury. Out of my way, idiot geese. Morning, John! Oh. Have you heard Lord Christopher Jones has finally found a suitable match? Do you not want to know who he has chosen to marry? I doubt I have any choice in the matter. A Miss Marjorie Notcutt. Mmm. Fascinating. Is that from Selina, my dear? Yes. She writes so often I can barely keep up. Oh, dear. Mr. Woodbury has proposed again. I have noticed Mr. Malcolm doesn't appear to be calling. I do have more than one gentleman caller. You must not feel too bad you have failed to capture his notice. Some say he will never choose a wife. I feel perfectly fine. Mmm. There is something from Lady Burke. She's sent me one of those wicked caricatures that are all the rage. It appears to be of Mr. Malcolm. And I am in it as well. No. It can't be. Oh, Julia. Did you hear about Mr. Malcolm? - No. Well, he turned away Miss Thistlewaite. Come inside! Quickly! Never been inside here before. It's cozy. Is this all of them? - All the ones for sale. - They're here in the window. - I don't understand. - Miss Thistlewaite. -How embarrassing. -Oh, my! Do you have a pencil? How mortifying. Her reputation must be in tatters. Cassie, please discover what I did to incur this humiliation. Take this to my cousin. You will find him at his club. The Lord of Limbs. Immediately! I am ruined. She'll never find a husband, I think. Steady. Refreshment, sir? Thank you. Good evening, sir. Goodness. I shall come here more often. Good evening. Good to see you. - Did you hear... - Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen. Final bet, Cassidy? Yes. Final or nothing. Your turn, madam. Good sport as always, milord. You, you're a cheat. Absolute cheat. Cheers. Ooh, that's strong. Oh, God. Who else has seen this? Tell Miss Thistlewaite I will handle the matter. Mr. Malcolm. Excuse me. My dance card at the Millers' ball next week has a free space, if you would be so inclined. You will have to forgive me. A riding ailment does not permit me, Miss... Lady Gwyneth Amberton. Lady Amberton. Daughter of Earl and Countess Amberton. Of course. How strange. I do wonder how one encourages sentiment without dancing. Malcolm. Lord Cassidy, Lady Amberton. Hello. How do you do? How do you do? Now, excuse us. Uh, Malcolm, you are acquiring quite the reputation. Is that so? Yes, indeed. They are calling you a trifler... ...a breaker of hearts, a destroyer of young ladies' dreams. You're joking. No. What nonsense. Well, perhaps the gossips are correct. You paid very particular attention to my cousin Julia and now have not been to call. I escorted your cousin to the opera once. I did not pay her "very particular attentions." What actually occurred is besides the point. It's what people say that matters. And everyone is saying that there must be something wrong with Julia. I'm sorry that your cousin has become the target of gossips, but I do not plan to marry a woman merely because I took her to the opera. No, no one said you had to. That is what they want, isn't it? What are those dreams I am accused of destroying? Dreams of marrying the "catch of the season" purely for my fortune. I will not have it. Place your bets. Do you want in? No, no. I have spent all my money. Oh, excellent. Why not just choose some girl and just make an end of it? You know, propagation of the species and all that. Why do you think I am here tonight? I am very anxious to find a suitable bride. Then why not Julia? She's generally acknowledged as a handsome woman. Here you go, sir. Thank you. She's handsome enough, but she's not the one for me. - No. - Place your bets. Why not? I don't know. She-- She flutters her eyelashes far too much. Malcolm, that's blinking. That-- That is your reason? No, that's a pretty paltry reason. It was very distracting. Numerous times throughout the evening, I thought she was going to fall asleep. Don't look at me like that. Place your bets. It was not the only thing that turned me off Miss Thistlewaite. Here. Item four. "Converses in a sensible fashion." My tailor's conversation is far more scintillating than your cousin's. I tried to engage her in a discussion about the Corn Laws, and she thought it was a diet regimen. It's your turn, sir. What is this? Is this a list? Place your bets. Yes, it is. You have some sort of list of qualifications for a bride? Yes, I do. So? - Chance, sir. - You may roll again. That is damned arrogant of you. No wonder you cannot settle upon anyone. You want them to meet some catalog of requirements, like a... Very well done, sir. ...like a tandem horse you're purchasing for your curricle. Exactly. Exactly that! I have specific requirements when filling my stable. Why not even more stringent requirements when choosing a bride? A companion I will see morning... Shall we roll again, sir? ...noon and night. Next thing you know, you'll be putting her through her paces or checking her teeth. -Disaster. -I'll add that to the list. Bad luck, sir. One more? No, I'm not drinking. One more. She does not bite, you know. You have the manners of a Billingsgate fishwife! I would not know, as I do not keep the low society you do, Cousin. From my friend Selina. Evidently, the news has reached Sussex. Tomorrow the whole of England will know. Did you... speak to Mr. Malcolm? I did. What did he say about me? Well, he agreed that you are a handsome woman. Did he? That is good news. But he has this list, you see, and, um... Well, unfortunately, you did not meet the fourth qualification. I would have failed it myself as I have no interest in politics and have always found the Corn Laws particularly confusing. He has a list... of requirements for a bride? Yes. And I must say that I did not care for the idea at first myself, but then when he explained it to me, I could see his point. What if the girl has some odd kick in her gallop? Charming! Well, his brother, the Viscount, was lured into a terrible match and left miserable as a consequence. I don't believe it. The arrogance! I would like to see what is on this list. Cassie. Did you see it? No. Yes. But it would do you no good. No good at all. No one can live up to these expectations. I mean, even if you'd passed the Corn Laws test, your eyelashes, they irritated him to no end. My eyelashes? Is the man deranged? No, of course not. You just can't fool him with those tricks you pull. He despises flirtatious games. The unmitigated gall. What conceit! Is it rather warm in here? Somehow I will see to it that the Honorable Mr. Malcolm receives exactly what he deserves. He won't get away with this. Right. Right. Well, I'd best be off. And you're going to help me. No. Julia, absolutely not. Julia, no. Julia, what are you doing? Julia, stop. My dearest Selina... ...thank you for your kind correspondence in regards to that vile caricature. I've been thinking that it would cheer me up no end to see you after all this time. Will you come visit me in London for what is left of the season? I promise you will be well entertained. Apparently, she's from the country. Would you just be quiet for once, John? Posture. Steady. Whoa! Well. Selina! Julia! You made it! I did! How long has it been? My dear, how you've blossomed! You look well yourself! I'm so glad you're here. You must be parched. Come inside. Yes. John, put Selina's bags in her room immediately. My dear cousin, Lord Cassidy, is dying to meet you. So, tell us more about how you've been occupying your time in the charming countryside. It's such a different life from here in town. Yes. Well, as I mentioned in my letters, I had been in Bath serving as a companion to the elderly Lady Ossory in her final years. Yes, Lady Ossory. How dreary for you. No, no. It was not at all unpleasant, though I did long for some companions my own age. Bath has become quite the destination for septuagenarians. Oh, my dear, I understand completely. I find foreigners very tedious as well. Well, your letter came in the nick of time as I've yet to find another position. My dear Selina, if it is a position that you're looking for, I may have the very thing. Well, "position" may not be quite the right word. It's more of a project, a lark. You see, there is a gentleman, a Mr. Malcolm, who is widely known for his arrogance. Is he the one in that awful caricature? The very same. As you may know, he paid me very public, very pointed attentions and then humiliated me by withdrawing his suit. Julia, how dreadful for you. Mmm. Uh, I-- I am so sorry. It was very unpleasant, especially when I found out that he had a list that he judged me against and found me wanting. What sort of list? It is a list of the qualifications he is looking for in a bride. But he believes himself to be so superior that his qualifications are quite unreachable. I would love for Mr. Malcolm to receive the comeuppance he deserves, but I need your assistance. My assistance? Hmm? If we were to present you as the perfect woman that he is looking for, and then allow him to discover that you have a list, and he does not meet the requirements on your list, well, that would be a perfect sort of poetic justice. I don't know. It's-- It sounds rather... Mm-mmm. ...devious. My dear Selina! Do not be such a namby-pamby! I will not allow that man to ruin one more reputation. But if he is as arrogant and fastidious as you say, then how am I to attract his attention? If Mr. Malcolm was not captivated by you, then surely he will not even look in my direction. Oh, Selina. What an astute observation. However, even though your look is not fashionable in the classical sense, you are more informed than I or any other young lady before you. You know about the list. And with some tutelage from my cousin and me... Mmm. ...you have a very good chance of meeting the requirements. Your-- Your cousin is going to instruct me on how to attract a sophisticated gentleman of particular tastes? Mmm. Apparen-- Apparently, yes. I-I-I don't think I... My dear Selina. I do hope you'll agree to help me. After all, we've always looked out for each other, have we not? Plus, it could be rather fun. What is it exactly that you want me to do? Oh! Thank you. Item number one: "Handsome of countenance and figure." Oh. That's lovely, Molly. Lower across the bodice. Julia! Number two: "Graceful and well mannered." Look at me. Back arched just a little, Selina. We are having the gown cut low. We don't want him to miss the effect. Julia, that's outrageous! And we are... One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. Don't stop now. You will trip Cassie. One, two, three. One, two, three. And fly like a bird! Spin out. Pirouette. Number three: "Educates herself by extensive reading." Becoming a suitable bride is quite burdensome. I almost feel as if I'm being trained up to become a wife. I know. God forbid someone decided to enter a marriage based on love. What a wonderful thing to say. You must exude an elegance of mind, a knowledge of the world, while still retaining the naïveté that men find so charming. -Do you know anything about the Corn Laws? -Of course I do. It's very important that you do. I've brought you some tracts on the subject. Do not waste too much time on those tracts, Selina. A gentleman doesn't like a lady to be more intelligent than he is. A wife with a mind, God forbid. And thinking too deeply causes forehead furrows. It might be a good idea if you meditated on the ocean. I find when I think of the sea... I'm less apt to wrinkle my brow. Oh! I almost forgot. No blinking. I beg your pardon? Malcolm doesn't like flirtatious tricks. Well, Cassie, if you were paying the least bit of attention, you would have realized I already explained to Selina that there should be no artificiality in her behavior when she pretends an attraction to Mr. Malcolm. That doesn't sound anything at all like what I said. Well, excuse me for not using words of fewer syllables. Oh. Well, if you're so bloody smart, Miss Hoity-Toity, how come you couldn't pass Malcolm's little test? What is this now, your fourth season? Maybe if you'd warned me! I didn't want anything to do with this. I don't want anything to do with you! That's not-- Enough! I believe I have an idea of what Mr. Malcolm is looking for. Now, what plan do you have for us to meet? Selina, you are blending in. Now you must hide. A job masterfully done, I'd say. Julia, I'm a little nervous. Do not worry. Wait in here. Hmm? I shall return. I should have stayed in Sussex after all. I beg your pardon? Uh, I'm-- I am sorry to disturb you, sir. I thought this room to be unoccupied. 'Tis no matter. Um, hiding from the dancing? Uh, something like that. I was, um... reflecting on the futility of a dream. Is any dream futile? It gives us hope, and hope is a good thing. In your opinion. Others of us may believe, as the poet said, "'Tis hope is the most hopeless thing of all." What a sad conviction. I prefer to believe, as Johnson did, that hope is a "chief happiness which this world affords." But, perhaps, you hope for something unworthy, in which case you deserve to hope in vain. Confess, sir. You were hoping to win at the gaming tables and have lost, and are now indulging in a fit of pique. I would not confess to such childish conduct. Though had I played, I would have hoped to win. So you contend you hope for something worthy? I do, indeed. Then it is my hope that you obtain it. I am honored. Perhaps I am mistaken in thinking hope a useless thing. I-- I'm... Excuse me. I'm sorry. I disturbed you. I... I should go. No. No. I should be the one to leave. I have spent enough time in solitary reflection. I would be honored, once you return to the ballroom, to be properly introduced. Anyway, as my mother always said, I am a natural-born dancer. I really am. I mean, dancing runs in my fam-- Cassidy. Excuse me. Where have you been? I have a likely prospect for you. Young filly, deep-chested, long legs. I very much regret using this horse analogy. No, I think you'll like this one. She has quite the air of mystery about her. That sounds alarming. I tend to keep my distance from mysterious young ladies. Besides, I think I just found a likely prospect of my own. I just wonder how long she'll stay in the orangery. Sorry? Sorry, what's that? Did you meet-- Did you say you just met someone in the orangery? Yes. Though she's probably married or equally ineligible. Excuse me. I'll be right back. Lord Cassidy. Sorry. Oh. Where is he off to? Excuse me! Selina, did you-- did you just meet a gentleman in here? Yes. He was delightful. Excellent! I do not see what's excellent about it. Julia says I'm not to leave this room. She says she has to create an-- an "aura of mystery" about me. Forget what Julia told you. We're returning to the ballroom immediately. Why? Do you know the gentleman? I rather think I do. Come on. Quickly. Quickly. My dear girl, where have you been? I see your dance card is empty. Do not be so judicious. Hmm? Do you want a drink? No. Julia. What are you doing here? The beau monde is fascinated by the mysterious incognita. There has been an interesting development. Mr. Malcolm! There's someone I want to introduce you to. M-Mr. Malcolm? That is correct. Mr. Malcolm, how lovely to see you, and how well you look. Mrs. Thistlewaite. Miss Thistlewaite. Mr. Malcolm. I, however, have yet to learn your name. Mr. Jeremy Malcolm, may I present Miss Selina Dalton? Miss Dalton, I am very pleased to make your acquaintance, properly. Now, tell me, Mr. Malcolm. - Hmm? Will your delightful mother, Her Ladyship, be joining us this season? "Properly"? They stumbled upon each other moments ago in the orangery. How unpredictable! It's wonderful. I was hoping, Miss Dalton, perhaps you might join me for a tour of the Dulwich Picture Gallery tomorrow. Thank you. That would be nice. Tomorrow, then. Lord Cassidy. Y-Yes. Well done. Mr. Malcolm courting yet another one. Shh! I think he might hear you. Well, you most certainly have a reputation. As? A trifler? Well, yes. Breaker of hearts? I suppose one could say that. A destroyer of young ladies' dreams? That is an absurd exaggeration, but I have heard rumors along those lines. And you? Do you believe this description of me? I am not ready to pass judgment. Well, I am glad to hear you say that, Miss Dalton, for I do not believe I deserve this reputation I have acquired. Particularly in the case of Miss Thistlewaite, I find myself blameless. She told me you paid her very marked attentions. I escorted her to the opera once. I see. Was it an amusing opera? No. No, it wasn't. The soprano missed most of her notes, and Miss Thistlewaite wore this feather which brushed against my nose so frequently over the course of the evening, I found myself wanting to sneeze. Well, you and Miss Thistlewaite are the victims of a most egregious set of circumstances. Feathers and screeching sopranos are not conducive to romance. So you acquit me of trifling with Miss Thistlewaite's affections? I am-- I am afraid I cannot. You were too easily put off. A sincere gentleman would have tried a second time before casting a woman aside in the public eye. Invited her to a musical concert, perhaps. But I knew I was not interested in Miss Thistlewaite after the opera. Had I continued to pursue her, I would have deserved the reputation I have acquired. So what would you have me do in such circumstances? Jeremy? Excuse me. Jeremy Malcolm. Henry Ossory, as I live and breathe! What are you doing here? I thought you were stationed with your regiment in the north. I'm just in town for the memorial of Lieutenant Colonel Donoghue. But I am thinking of selling out and joining the ranks of you idle gentlemen wastrels. Are you sure you're up to it? It can be quite exhausting. Well... Excuse me, Miss Dalton. May I present Captain Henry Ossory? Miss Dalton? Captain Ossory? Miss Selina Dalton? Yes. I take it the two of you are familiar with each other. Yes. Miss Dalton was an excellent friend of my uncle's widow. I wanted to thank you for your kindness to my aunt. I see. But what a fortunate coincidence to come upon you so unexpectedly. How opportune. I am very pleased to meet you, Captain. I esteemed your aunt very highly and have long wished to express my condolences. Why, thank you. I served as a companion to Captain Ossory's aunt in Bath during her final years. How very kind. Well, I should let you resume your tour with Mr. Malcolm. But I would be pleased to call on you, if you would give me your direction. I am staying at the Thistlewaites' in Berkeley Square. Well, Mr. Malcolm. Ossory. Miss Dalton. Oh. Uh, do make sure you see the Venus and Adonis. Quite exquisite. Goodbye. What a fortuitous meeting. Quite. Look at Mr. Malcolm. Doesn't look pleased, does he? Good evening, Molly. Do not mind us! Uh, excuse me, Miss? Selina must be absolutely famished. Good evening, Molly. Just a little something. It's beautiful. So... what did he say about me? Um, merely that he escorted you to the opera. I must admit, Julia, that does not seem such a heinous crime. Did he tell you about my eyelashes? Your eyelashes? Just wait until he starts to weigh you up against that list of his. Then you'll see how unpleasant he can be. Oh, Selina. I need you to help me. There's no way I can touch him. He holds all of London society in his palm. But I'm just not sure he is the villain you paint him to be. I want him humiliated, as I was. More than anything, I-- I want my reputation restored. And my-- my prospects are dwindling. I truly understand, but maybe... I have known you nearly all my life. And you have known Malcolm for, what, less than a day? Ugh. He has this effect on all women. It's like he exercises some kind of power over them. He did not exercise any power over me. Are you sure? You did not find something mesmerizing about him? I cannot deny that I see a certain... attraction. I knew it. You're being blinded by his intelligent conversation and devastatingly handsome good looks. Well, take it from me, it leads to nowhere. Are you feeling well today, Julia? Yes, quite well. Captain Ossory. Oh. I'm not acquainted with a Captain Ossory. Are you, Julia? Captain Ossory is an acquaintance of mine. Oh. Send him in at once. May I present Captain Ossory to you, ma'am? Captain Ossory, Mrs. Thistlewaite and Miss Thistlewaite. Your servant, Mrs. Thistlewaite, Miss Thistlewaite. Please be seated, Captain. Thank you, ma'am, but actually I came to request the pleasure of a promenade with Miss Dalton. Another one! That would be lovely. Please excuse me while I collect my things. Of course. So, Captain Ossory? Yes. I was not aware that Selina had an acquaintance in town. Yes, Miss Dalton was a dear friend of my aunt's. It's very strange. She's never mentioned you. Pity. Are you situated in town or is this a flying visit? Newly situated, yes. I hope you don't mind the intrusion. A friend of Selina's is surely a friend of mine-- Ours. Thank you both. How kind. -Shall we go? -Yes. Mrs. Thistlewaite, Miss Thistlewaite, lovely to meet you both. Indeed. What? I'm not sure if you are aware, Miss Dalton, but my aunt mentioned you many times in her correspondence with me. Your aunt spoke of you quite often, as well. I am very pleased to have this opportunity to make your acquaintance. Yes, I feel likewise. I must admit, however, to yet another motive for seeking you out. I came to London to meet you because it's my belief that my aunt desired us to make a match. What gave you that impression? Well, her letter to me before her death, in it she wrote, "It is my desire that you and Miss Dalton make a match." I see. Then it appears you interpreted her meaning correctly. Yes, yes. Her words were rather plain. Unless, of course, she could have been speaking of cribbage. She could have meant we should engage in a cribbage match. Or chess. Could she not have been speaking of chess? I am afraid not. She knew me to be a very, very poor chess player. Ah. Um, good day, Henry. Miss Dalton. Jeremy. Good day, Mr. Malcolm. It appears I have interrupted a humorous discussion. Well... It was nothing of consequence. We were discussing a letter Captain Ossory received from his aunt. Lovely. Good. Well, I wondered if you were to attend Lady Hartley's ball week after next. -I believe I am. -Excellent. As it happens, I too am to attend Lady Hartley's ball. Perhaps I might be favored with a dance? Certainly. Excellent. Well, shall we? Mm-hmm. After you. Good day, sir. I've heard she's from Sussex! I must say, whatever is the matter, dear Selina? Where is Sussex? I, um-- I received correspondence from my mother. She's asked me to call on my cousin's widow, Mrs. Covington, while I'm in town. Whatever is wrong with her? When I met her last, she would not accept me at my word that I had no beau. She quizzed me on the subject for 20 minutes before offering to find me a husband. I hate to think how she'll react when she finds out I'm still unwed. She was married, widowed and married again by our age. How vulgar. Selina, whatever you do, do not mention to Mr. Malcolm that you have such a vulgar cousin. One of the requirements on his list is: "Has genteel relations from good society." I wouldn't call the Daltons "from good society." But, Selina, you're the daughter of a clergyman. That's at least fourth-class society, possibly even third. At best. Oh, and while we're speaking of it, at the dinner party, you will need to play the pianoforte. What? Musical talent is another requirement on Malcolm's list. Malcolm, he loves music. But I don't play the pianoforte. I am surprised Mr. Malcolm desires a wife when he could just as easily hire a performing bear. Do not worry, dear Selina. I have a plan. Mr. Banbury, how's your wife? So, tell me, Captain Ossory, how are you finding society life so far? I seem to be constantly thwarted in my endeavors. Hmm. What endeavors are those, may I ask? The art of courtship. Well, ladies? What do we think? - Tolerable enough? - Handsome enough to tempt? I find courting to be less an art than an avocation. You served in the Peninsular, did you not, Captain Ossory? Yes, in the 18th Regiment of Light Dragoons. Did you see any action, Captain? Yes, at Waterloo. I saw more death than a man should, but a great victory all round. How brave. Swapping a battlefield for a ballroom. How ironic. Perhaps. However, I still find myself surrounded by a multitude of sweaty men desperate for female company. Miss Dalton, tell me, how do you know Miss Thistlewaite? -You met at school, I believe? -Yes, we attended-- We, uh, both attended Mrs. Finch's Ladies Academy as girls. I attended on the kindness of a benefactor of my father's. I was bullied quite terribly, but Julia was kind to me. Mmm. Miss Dalton, I was curious, what is your opinion on the Church Building Act? What a weighty question to ask over soup. I believe it is in bad taste to discuss politics before the entrée is served. Perhaps you are correct. However, I am interested in Miss Dalton's opinion. Well, as the daughter of a clergyman, it is obviously important to me that there are houses of worship available to all. However, I feel that the million pounds set aside for this purpose is exorbitant. I believe our government intends by this measure to suppress the radicals and keep anarchy at bay, when they could use some of those funds to better the lot of the poor, thereby accomplishing the same purpose. They could just pay us better. Hear! Hear! Wonderful. I apologize for the lecture, but you did ask me for my opinion. I am sure your father himself could not preach a more eloquent sermon. And you, Mr. Malcolm, what's your opinion on the matter? Although I doubt you will be able to express your argument as well. It's very much the same, actually. Good shot, Miss Thistlewaite. Oh. I must be nearsighted! Selina, you're taking losing mighty well. How amiable and even-tempered of you. Take another shot, my dear. May I assist? Yes. So, keep your shoulders in line with the target. Ball between your feet. A little more. Hands steady. Deep breath in. Thank you. Brilliant. All right, Captain Ossory. It's your shot for the win. It's an easterly wind, so aim a little to the right. - Well done. - Marvelous! It would have been a shame to lose on such an easy shot. Can you pass me the shawl? Quite. My legs are cold. The wind was, uh, westerly. If I had listened to you, I would have. Oh, Captain. I'm pretty sure it's to the east. I'm surprised you lasted that long in the cavalry with such a dreadful sense of direction. Besides, I never lose. Neither do I. My lords and ladies, may I have your attention, please? Lot seven, an eight-year-old Irish draft mare. All of 16 hands. Well-schooled and hunted, she's sporting countryside. Have I an opening bid of 150... My mother used to always say, "Never, ever, ever go near a horse--" Enough about the horses! Tell us what Malcolm thinks of our girl. No, please, not this again. He told me that he was initially impressed by her wit and humor, um, but was concerned that she was not serious enough. But after the dinner party, that fear was laid to rest. "Not serious enough." He certainly makes rash judgments. It's as I've told you, Selina. There is no pleasing the man. No, no. Look, I may have quoted him incorrectly. He was very, very complimentary. He said you've nearly met all of the qualifications on his list, which is a good thing. Oh, dear. I know this is hard to hear, Selina, but it shall be over soon. - Julia, that's not what I'm saying. - Selina! Selina Dalton! How rude! As I live and breathe. Cousin Gertie! What a surprise! May I introduce my dear friend... Miss Thistlewaite. Miss Thistlewaite. That's a mouthful. Miss Thistlewaite. Say that one 20 times. Miss Thistlewaite. Miss Thistlewaite. Miss-- Say it, try, try! Miss Thistlewaite. Miss-- You can't do it! What you need, my girl, is a husband so you can change that ghastly tongue twister of a name. Mrs. Covington, may I introduce you to Lord Cassidy? - How do you do? - Oh, Lord. Hey, Malcolm. Malcolm! Is that the famous Mr. Malcolm? Do you know him? I saw the most hilarious caricature of him a few weeks past. I didn't know you were here. Mr. Malcolm. Captain Ossory. What a wonderful surprise. Nice to see you again, Miss Thistlewaite. Mrs. Covington, may I present the Honorable Mr. Malcolm and Captain Henry Ossory. I'm delighted to make your acquaintance, Mrs. Covington. Mrs. Covington. No, sir, it is I who am delighted. Well, I have never been in the same room with a captain, a lord and an honorable. Although, I am not quite exactly sure what it means to be an honorable. It's the next best thing to a lord, am I right? He is the younger son of an earl. Oh, oh, oh. Now, that's a real pity. Because you've got the look of a lord, much more than this young gentleman over here. You know, Mr. Malcolm has a more, um... dignified look about him. Cassie, I think Mrs. Covington would probably like a drive home... by a lord. I'm sure His Lordship has other plans for the rest of the afternoon. No. No, he doesn't have any plans. Julia, I do. No, you don't. I do. No, I-- No, I don't. Thank you. I would be honored. I am glad I dressed so sensibly today. Is this hat not ravishing on me? Quite. Quite. Shall we go then? Of course, of course. One thing I learned in my two trips to the altar is that the gentlemen don't like to be kept waiting. Oh, yes! They're never waiting. Oh, yes. Selina, Julia Thistlewaite-- I'll call sometime soon. Excuse me, sorry. Yes! And how are you acquainted with Mrs. Covington? She-- She is-- My cousin. -Your cousin? -Yes. -Right. -Seven times removed. Selina, my dear, if we're not buying, we'd better be going. Well, before you leave, I was wondering if Miss Dalton would join me for a ride tomorrow? Um, I-I-- She would be honored to ride with you, Mr. Malcolm. Now, that's settled. Us ladies should leave you gentlemen to your stallions. Good afternoon. Ladies. All done. At 84, the seller in front. At 84 guineas, last. Sold! My dear Selina, it is working. And now thanks to me, you will not fail item six. I thought that must be why you claimed her. Couldn't imagine you felt a sudden desire for her kinship. Ugh. No. Just do not reverse course on me. I will not, Julia. I promise to be everything he desires in a woman: witty, humorous, serious, genteel, musical, fashionable, only the best relations and all at the same time. Excellent. Selina! I thought you might like to wear this. Oh. It is-- It is magnificent. But I cannot. Nonsense. I must say, it looks ravishing on you. It is yours now. Thank you, Julia. It is nothing. See you tonight. See you tonight. Mmm. That is a very beautiful bonnet on you. You are very quiet this afternoon. Please don't feel the need to make conversation. I much prefer silence to those that rattle on with nothing to say, like that Mrs. Covington. She's quite the character, isn't she? I must say, I'm very glad I'm not courting Miss Thistlewaite. Beg your pardon? What do you mean? Well, I mean... Well, it's obvious, isn't it? That I would want my future companion's relations to have a modicum of gentility. And if they did not? I'm sorry I introduced the subject. 'Tis a moot point, after all. I'm not courting Miss Thistlewaite. I'm court-- Well... I think it's quite clear who it is I'm courting, isn't it? But if you were still courting Julia and you had met Mrs. Covington, would that affect your opinion of Julia? Well, it would have to, wouldn't it? There's a saying where my family is from. A man who marries a woman marries all her relatives. I'm sorry, I... I've said too much. I understand this is quite overwhelming. And what do you find overwhelming, Mr. Malcolm? The society balls. Gold-rimmed tea cups. The tying of silk cravats. All of this is very easy. You learn the rules. You follow the rules. If there is a moment where there is no rule, you make a rule, you follow that. I find everything else overwhelming. Why did you come to London, Miss Dalton? Because I was lonely. I was lonely, too, before you came. I... I am having a house party at my estate in Kent, and I would be pleased if you would come as my guest. I am honored by the invitation, but I am a guest of the Thistlewaites. I will invite them as well. And Cassie, of course. I'll even invite Ossory if you'd like. My mother is coming to act as hostess, and I thought perhaps your parents might like to come as well. Thank you. I shall write and ask them. I suppose we should be heading back. Miss Dalton, I am so sorry. I seem to have torn your dress. 'Tis no matter, Mr. Malcolm. It can easily be repaired. Please, call me Jeremy. Jeremy. Did Mr. Malcolm mention if Captain Ossory has been invited? Yes. He told me he's on the guest list. Ugh. What a bother that man has become. I shall have to distract him, of course. My dear, have you thought about Captain Ossory for yourself? Mummy, no! He's a perfectly good match, but far too low down in comparison to our own good standing. Mm-hmm. We're here. Well, that certainly looks impressive. A Mrs. Thistlewaite, Miss Thistlewaite and Miss Dalton, my lady. My darling Selina. Mama! I missed you so much! My little chickpea! You look so well! Welcome to Hadley Hall. Thank you. It is beautiful. A little smaller in real life. May I present my mother Elizabeth Malcolm, the Countess of Kilbourne. Lady Kilbourne will do just fine. Mrs. Howard will show you to your rooms. I thought you might like to refresh yourselves before joining us for tea. That would be lovely. How's Kitty? She was pining a little bit, but she'll be fine. Miss Dalton... I am very happy you're here. I am very happy to be here. The stables are in the East Wing. I could get used to the country. One day, I'll buy a house just like this. Not on your salary. My son tells me you were raised in Sussex, Miss Dalton. Yes, my lady. Which part of Sussex? Chailey. And, Mr. Dalton, I believe you still serve as vicar there? Yes, my lady, coming on nearly 20 years now. And, Mrs. Dalton, are your people from Sussex as well? My family's name is Kingswater. Kingswater. I'm afraid I do not know any Kingswaters. Mrs. Thistlewaite, we cannot thank you enough for taking care of our Selina. It's been no problem at all. Selina, I forgot to ask you how Mrs. Covington is. Did you call on her as I asked? Mrs. Covington is the widow of my cousin. She lives in town. I did run into Mrs. Covington. Good. I'm glad to hear it. Her husband was my second cousin only, but she is a widow. Mrs. Dalton and myself have always taught Selina to show compassion to those in less fortunate circumstances. Pray, excuse me as I take a turn about the room. He fell at Waterloo. He died a hero's death by all accounts. Cut down by cannon while defending Wellington's flank. There was nothing left of him to bury, so we were forced to conduct his funeral in absentia. Terribly sad. Miss Dalton. I do not care that Mrs. Covington is your cousin and I am sorry I gave that impression. It is I who must apologize. I think you were concerned for my good opinion and thought if you told the truth, you'd lose it. It is my fault. I sounded dreadfully arrogant and I have regretted it many times since. I've been wanting to tell you the truth, but I-- I believe you. Then let's forget all about this foolish incident. It does neither of us any good to harp on it. Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Dalton, perhaps you could write to your cousin and invite her to join us at next week's ball. That sounds like such a fun idea. Don't you agree, Mr. Dalton? Yes. Well, I am confident that the behavior that prevails at these occasions in town will not permit here. Mr. Malcolm seems a very trustworthy gentleman. Selina? May I come in? Selina, I... I think it is time. If you think it is time for bed, I can only agree. No. I think it is time to show Mr. Malcolm your list. Julia... I know Mr. Malcolm hurt your feelings and I am so sorry. What are you saying? I am saying that I do not think Mr. Malcolm is the man you think he is. I see. Now that you have seen Hadley Hall and seen how rich he is, you think you can get him to marry you, is that it? I wonder if you would like him as much if he was a poverty-stricken curate from Yorkshire. No, that is not it! I am not interested in Mr. Malcolm because of his possessions. He has been kind to me. You agreed to help me. We were in this together. I don't feel Mr. Malcolm deserves such treatment. And I? You think I deserve such treatment? I was humiliated in front of the whole of good society. Have you never offended anyone? It happens. Frequently! No one wants a person incapable of forgiveness for a friend. And I don't want a prosy preacher's daughter for a friend. This is mine! What was that? Probably that Miss Thistlewaite. She looks the door-slamming type to me. Thank you, Reeves. What surprises me is that she did not set her cap for you. She did, at first. It was short-lived. What happened? Well, I took her to the opera once and... did not call again. It died a natural death. Hmm. So you think. I doubt she'd forget that kind of rejection very quickly. She's not enjoying taking second place to your Miss Dalton. She's not my Miss Dalton. Not yet. Yes, I know. I do wish you would hurry the business. You know how much I detest entertaining. So, you approve? If I had my wits about me, I'd persuade you to marry some silly, ignorant girl against whom I would not suffer in comparison. Someone like your brother's wife. Mother, you would suffer no matter whom I married. And surely you must know by now, relations by marriage were designed to aid us in developing our character. Selina... Selina is a gift from God in that regard. And far be it for me to question the Almighty. Mr. Dalton would not approve. Checkmate. Yes, Mother. I know. Well done. Thank you, sir. Selina! Captain Ossory! I think it should be a masquerade. They're all the rage. Yeah, but I have to wear a mask though. It's not up to you. It's Mr. Malcolm's home. Of course it is, but... We were just discussing next week's ball. Right. Julia wants it to be a masquerade. What is your opinion? Well, I've never been to a masquerade before. See, Mr. Malcolm? It must be a masquerade. Selina has never been to one. Then it's decided. A masquerade it is. I do believe we have some costumes in the attic, sir. Excellent. Thank you, Reeves. Everyone feel free to help yourselves. Thank you. I should be able to find what I need at the dressmakers. Do you plan on going as a lady? Of course not. A Greek. Any particular Greek? Any Greek will do. Julius Caesar. Julius Caesar was Roman. Greek, Roman, it scarcely matters. I plan to wear a white robe and some leaves over my ears. I went to one of these blasted things as Henry VIII once. I almost suffocated. I remember. What are you wearing, Selina? Um... I have no idea. I was hoping to get some inspiration once I visited the attic. Why not go as your namesake? Who do you mean? Selene, goddess of the moon. Cassie has already taken my costume. I told you, I'm not going as a woman. I'll be one of those, um... philosophical fellows, like Plato or Socrates. My cousin going as one of the deepest thinkers in history. That does quite boggle the mind. So will you go as Selene? I have no objection masquerading as a goddess. Who is this Selene? Selene was the goddess of the moon, which she drove across the sky every night. The story goes that she fell in love with a mere mortal who was far beneath her, both literally and metaphorically. -Hmm. -Hmm. I had no idea military men had such an intimate understanding of mythology. Oh, I think there's quite a lot you don't know about military men. Selina, I would be happy to assist you with your costume. I could take some designs to my dressmaker when I head into town. Why, thank you, Julia. Mmm. Right. Miss Thistlewaite, let's shoot something. If we must. Gentlemen. Now, the trick is keep the stock tight to your chest and shoot where the bird will be rather than where it is. All right? Thank you, sir. Hmm. I think I've got it. I've never seen a woman do that before. I suppose that's a compliment. It most certainly is, yes. Mr. Dalton, is that really the best you could have done? Oh, Mr. Malcolm, what a pleasure to be invited to your very impressive home. You must be very thirsty, Mrs. Covington. Allow me to escort you to get some punch. How gracious, Mr. Malcolm. You, the host. I knew what they said about him couldn't be true. Shall we? Oh, yes. Mother. Oh. Cassie. Yes. I must speak with you. You know, Julia, I must say, I don't know why ladies complain about having to wear feminine attire. This is quite a bit more comfortable than knee breeches, I can tell you. When I walk, there's the most refreshing breeze. Cousin, I did not come here to discuss the benefits of wearing a dress. It's not a dress. I need to talk to you about Selina and Malcolm. Ah. I see. You've finally caught on to the fact that all your scheming was for nothing. Well, I knew that all along. I knew they were perfectly suited to each other. I imagine that must sting just a little bit. You thought to humiliate Malcolm, and you end up presenting him with the perfect wife on a silver platter. A pirate! You know, Julia, you and Malcolm... you're much more alike than you've considered. You really shouldn't be so damned picky, or you might miss your chance. Boop! I'm going to go. Well, I almost didn't recognize you there, Miss Thistlewaite. Captain Ossory, is that you? Your costume is very out of character. I'm not sure how to take that remark. Do you find me dull and spiritless, not manly enough for swashbuckling adventure? No. No, I find you quite manly. I'm not entirely sure how we strayed onto that topic. The fault is entirely mine, though I cannot regret the unintentional compliment you gave me. Ladies and gentlemen, prepare your wigs and hoist your dresses... Shall we? ...for the quadrille. Which is quite nice. It's just a bit of fabric really. Julia Thistlewaite dancing with a military man? Well, I never! By the way, it's me, John. Well, she's quite taken by him, isn't she? Finally. My daughter, dancing with the captain? That is joyous. Mother, have you seen Selina? Well, it's not the easiest of tasks this evening, dear. Ladies and gentlemen, the waltz. May I, a mere mortal, beg of the goddess Selene the honor of this dance? You may. Her mask, isn't that wonderful? - That's Selina Dalton. - Oh, my. She is quite beautiful. Mr. Malcolm is dancing. Is that Julia Thistlewaite's friend? She's a complete nonentity. Her father is a country vicar. Well, he told me he couldn't dance. Mr. Dalton, look. Oh! Well, hello, sir. Well, it appears there may be wedding bells soon. Thank you for the company, but I really must go. Wait, Ju-- Julia. Selina, I-- Miss Dalton! Miss Thistlewaite needs you immediately. Come. Mr. Malcolm, please excuse me. What is it? Molly, where are you taking me? She is just through here, Miss. Molly! Molly! For Mr. Malcolm. She's too good for you, you know. That I believe wholeheartedly. Thank you, Reeves. I have an appointment in my study with a certain lady. Wish me luck, old boy. Next time you see me, hopefully I'll be betrothed. I would wish you luck, but I don't think you'll need it. Well, you cast your eye. The night is young. Julia! This reminds me of our first meeting. Do you remember what you said to me? I said I thought hope a futile thing, and you disagreed with me. Yet you said you hoped I obtained what I was looking for. You had little idea the thing I was looking for was you. I wanted to wait, at least until the end of the house party. But I do not think I could be any more convinced than I am right now. Selina... would you do me the great honor of becoming my wife? What's this? "Qualifications for a husband. Does not make others feel as if they cannot live up to an impossible standard." No, Selina. Selina, wait! Selina! Julia! Selina, aren't you supposed to be in the study? What? With Malcolm. He said he was meeting you there. I made no appointment with Mr. Malcolm. Please excuse me. Uh... Is everything all right? I don't know. Julia! What-- What is the meaning of this? Selina, wait! Wh-What's this? I think you'd best explain yourself, Julia. Miss Thistlewaite? So it was you who refused my offer just now. Offer? Well? It's his own fault. You spurned me publicly. All because I didn't meet a qualification on that cruel list of yours. So yes, I decided to show you what it feels like to be judged and found wanting. Can you blame me for enlisting Selina in the-- Selina? Don't tell me you had a part to play in this? Julia mentioned it to me. But you cannot think I-- Please. The time for pretense is over. I never engaged in any pretense. So you did not lie to me and tell me Mrs. Covington was not your cousin? Ladies and gentlemen, the cotillion. Good God, what a fool I have been. I should have known from then. J-Jeremy. You will call me Mr. Malcolm. M-Mr. Malcolm, please hear me out before you condemn me. And how can I believe a word you say? It seems you have been deceiving me from the beginning. Malcolm, perhaps you should listen to what she has to say. I hardly think you're the appropriate person to counsel me. It's obvious they've beguiled you as well. If you will excuse me, I am in the middle of hosting a ball. A masquerade, ironically. Do you see? Do you see now how arrogant he is? How could you stand there and say nothing? Well, if you're wondering whether to lock me in my room, I can assure you, I do not intend on coming down again tonight. Selina-- Don't bother. Are you satisfied with your behavior, Julia? Course not. Oh, I feel like I'm going to be sick. I think it's best I return to the ballroom. Your shoulders down. Stop standing on my feet. You disappeared early last night. Did I? You know, Selina, though Mr. Malcolm, from what acquaintance I have made of him, appears true of heart, he is nevertheless from an altogether different sphere. This decision I have come to believe you are making, we want you to know that it's yours and yours alone. And even if you and Mr. Malcolm should decide not to make a match of it, well, it's been nice to have had a little holiday. Papa. I'll leave you to your thoughts. Though it pains me to admit it, I have to concede that you were right, and I was... not entirely right. That should do the trick, sir. Thank you. Oh, we must do something. I think that's how this whole debacle began. Captain Ossory, what if you were to pretend to woo Selina? I think Malcolm was jealous of you before. It might work again. I don't think so. I prefer to let them work out matters for themselves. Well, they don't appear to be doing a very good job of it. Malcolm has all but disappeared since last night. Cassie? Hmm? Would you give us a moment, please? Yes, of course. I really should check where Malcolm is anyway. Captain Ossory, it's all perfectly harmless. I just want to ensure that Malcolm values Selina as he should. Hmm. I think there have been enough silly schemes. Don't you think, Miss Thistlewaite? But you wouldn't even have to do anything. Although it might be a good idea if you did pay Selina a little extra attention. I refuse to pretend an attraction I do not feel and stand by and let you ignore the one that I do feel. But you came to London to make a match with Selina. So now I'm not even allowed to decide to whom I'm attracted? Does this feel as though I'm attracted to Miss Dalton? Well? I may not be a lord or an honorable, but I'm falling in love with you, Julia. And I plan on devoting the rest of my life to keeping those nasty habits of yours in check. In fact, I positively look forward to it. Oh, Henry. Shh. Jeremy, could we speak outside? You know I don't like horses. You have some nerve, after the trick you all played on me. I was helping you. If only you had the wit to see it. 'Tis true that Julia wanted to humiliate you. I, on the other hand, I knew Miss Dalton was perfect for you from the very beginning. Whether you thought you were helping me or not, Miss Dalton used information she obtained from you about what I was looking for in a wife to become that woman. I have absolutely no idea who she actually is! That is simply not true. She barely paid any attention to anything that we said. Well, except the-- the musical talent part. That she had to fake. My point is, if she had listened to us, she probably wouldn't have attracted your notice at all. So what you're saying is she's smarter than you and Julia? No, no, that's not what I'm saying. She is most likely smarter than Julia or I-- For Christ's sake, Cassie! Dash it, you're twisting my words. What I'm trying to say, Jeremy, is that if-- Selina Dalton is the right woman for you, and if you ruin this, you'll regret it for the rest of your life. If I ruin this? Well, Lord Cassidy, I appreciate your concern. However, nowhere on my now-infamous list does it specify deception, lying or scheming. I am no longer interested in Miss Dalton and can only regret that I fell foul of her little game. Now, if you will excuse me. I suppose I have you to thank for this? I beg your pardon? If you had thought to orchestrate a compromising situation, I must admit, I had thought you a great deal cleverer than this. I received an invitation to tour the gardens. I assumed it to be a group tour. I certainly did not plan on meeting you here alone. I suppose it's coincidence then that I too received a note, though mine spouted some nonsense about "a discussion that promises great future benefit." It's all very melodramatic, now I think on it. You are to be commended, Miss Dalton. I have avoided a great number of attempts to entrap me in matrimony, but never have I met someone whose methods are so obviously contrived as you. You insufferable, arrogant, conceited coxcomb. I would never be content to marry a man who holds such a low opinion of me. Well, this is a good thing there has been no such engagement. I now wish I had taken a more enthusiastic part in Julia's despicable scheme to humble you, although I realize now it would have never worked. She expected you to fall in love with me. I have since learned that you-- that you are incapable of love, sir. Though perhaps we're all better for it because you're not worthy of it, either. Goodbye, Mr. Malcolm. I wish you and your list all the happiness in the world. Miss Dalton! Selina. Go away. You have every right to despise me. I despise myself. -Good. -I deserve that. Selina, I don't know why I went through with it. Initially, I wanted revenge on Mr. Malcolm. I was so angry that one man could turn my entire life into a farce. But then I did want to ruin your chances with him as well. Selina. We both had the dream of marrying for love. And after all of my failed seasons, I... I gave up hope. You captured Malcolm's heart without even trying. And I was so jealous of you. I couldn't bear to see you succeeding where I had failed. It all seems so silly now. If I had just stopped, I would have seen that the only person I was failing is you. Selina, do you think that you can forgive me? Please, please don't go. We must reconcile you with Malcolm. I think you might have been more correct in your reading of Mr. Malcolm than I was. That is very noble of you, Selina. But is this what you really want? I will have John prepare my carriage for you. Thank you. Julia. Yes? I do want to thank you before I leave. Had it not been for your-- for your scheme, I would have never experienced what it feels like to fall in love... and that alone makes me very content. I'm happy for you. What do you mean? Henry. He's a good man. How did you know? Cassie, of course. I would have never expected to fall in love with someone like Henry. He's just so... nice. Now, Julia, do not be such a namby-pamby. Move on. You do not look like a man who has just become happily engaged. That's because I'm not happily engaged. Miss Dalton has left. You have ruined things, haven't you? And after all my efforts. What-- What did you just say? I am saying that I arranged for a tour of the rose garden at three o'clock. I assumed it would give the two of you enough time alone together to come to some sort of betrothal. Why did you-- Why did you not tell me this earlier? If I had known you were in such a great hurry to bungle things, you can be assured I would not have exercised such forbearance. What did you do to upset Miss Dalton so? Nothing so serious. I merely accused her of attempting to entrap me in marriage. I must say, Jeremiah, I am quite disappointed in you. Mother-- I am well aware that you have a list. When I first learned of it, I was concerned that you had become arrogant and judgmental. But then I came to realize your list is in the nature of a shield. So many women have pursued you for your fortune that you did not want to give your heart to a woman that might prove unworthy. But I have never met so sincere a lady as Miss Selina Dalton. It is difficult for you to let someone past that guard that you've placed around your heart. But unless you do, you're in danger of losing Miss Dalton's altogether. Love cannot be planned so carefully, my dear. It will stir things up a bit. That is part of its charm. I have to go after her. There's no need to look so apprehensive. She will not eat you. You've not seen her in a temper. She is a fearsome sight. And more beautiful than ever. It's the way that they look at me. This one reminds me of Great Uncle Vivian. Yeah, Julia, he was killed by a horse. Do you know where she's going? She's gone back to Sussex. Her parents follow tomorrow. Thank you. And thank you, Cassie. You were right. I was-- I was right? Of course I was right! Miss Thistlewaite. I am sorry. I'm sorry too. -Let's go. -Go, Malcolm. Go! Go! Go, Malcolm! Hyah! What on earth do you think you're doing? Are you trying to get us both killed? I realized I forgot to give you something before you left. What is it? Do not tell me that is your infamous list. No. It's a new list that I just composed. Please? I would like to offer an explanation for the deplorable way I've treated you since I found out Miss Thistlewaite's plot and then again this afternoon in the rose garden. Though it pains me to admit, I was relieved to find an excuse to discredit you. There is a certain feeling of... insecurity when you find yourself falling in love with someone. And I can only hope that you will forgive me for being a misguided fool. Miss Selina Dalton, I have loved you deeply from the moment I saw you in the moonlight of that orangery. You are everything... everything I could have ever hoped for. You are the "chief happiness this world affords," to misquote Johnson. And I would count myself the most fortunate and humble of men if you would be my wife. You have yet to give me an answer. Tell me, though... what opinion do you hold on the Corn Laws? Has every stupid thing I've ever said or done been announced to the entire world? Jeremy, of course I will marry you.
