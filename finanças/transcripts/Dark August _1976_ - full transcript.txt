I beseech thee, Obel and Onagrel. Let this talisman draw the watchful power of thy demon cohorts. I call with grim delight this victim I have chosen. O great brothers of the night, thou who makest thy place of comfort, who rideth out of the hot winds of hell, who dwelleth in the devil's pain, move and appear... Silent is the voiceless bird that feeds upon the brain pulp of him, who hath tormented me. 'Present yourselves to him 'who sustaineth the rottenest of mind 'that moves the gibbering mouth 'that mocks the just and strong. 'Rend that gaggling tongue and close his throat. 'O, Kali, pierce his lungs with the stings of scorpions.' Come on. Let's go. Let's go in. What color revisions? All right, yes. All right. Send it back. Yeah, I mean, God forbid I should have a couple of extra days. All right, yes. No, I won't blow the account, no. Hmm. Yeah. No, the airline's safe. Uh, yeah, it's going good. Yeah, I... I'll, uh... I'll send it to you. Don't worry. Yeah. It's all good. You're a worrywart. Yeah. Take care. All right. Uh, give my regards to your wife, huh? All right. Dammit, one of these days I'm gonna rip that thing out transistor by transistor. - Still hungry? - Hmm? Uh, oh, no, thanks. - Sure. - Yeah. OK. Mona... breakfast. Come on. Here you go. I thought you were gonna give those things up. - What? - The cigarettes. I thought you were gonna give 'em up. Uh, yeah. I am. I'm gonna give 'em up. - Listen, Jackie, uh... - Uh-huh? Sometime today I'm gonna go over see Theo, OK? - Sure. - Only gonna be there for a little while. It's no problem. You don't feel you have to come, do you? - No, I wanna come. - My brother and I can hang the show. No, I... No, I wanna come. - Sure? - Really. - OK. - OK. What say you and I go for a drive? - Uh, don't we have to go the gallery? - Yeah, later. Right now, I'd really like to go for a drive with you. OK with me. Jackie... This is really bad. - It is. - Then why do you hang it? Well, if, uh, someone wants to show their work, they should have a place. Then again if I only hung what I really liked, it would be all my own stuff. Gotcha. You know, Leonard must have a deal with the framers. Mmm-hmm. He does. Hmm. - You know... - What? When I was a kid, my father used to take us for drives in the country. To him, Jackson Heights was the country. When we used to take these drives, I always used to imagine a great white horse running alongside the car. This great stallion with its mane flowing would follow us wherever we went. Whether it was in tunnels, over bridges, on highways, that great white horse would be there. - You know what? - What? You're the only other person in the world that owns one. Oh! Can I be the, uh, butter in your pumpernickel bread? Anytime. Here. Send your kid brother to a movie. I'll take it. No, wait. Come back here. Are we gonna hang pictures today or not? Yeah, sure, but first I just got up and I really need some coffee. - OK. Start without me. - Mmm-hmm. - Jackie, wait a minute. - Yeah? - Got you a present. - Yeah? Ah. Is this breakfast? Isn't it a little early? 'Tara, I don't know if we're keeping records and receipts. 'That's your department.' The only thing that I know anything about is stone knocking. - But it's a business. - Mmm-hmm. But I didn't expect it to be such a success. All right. I'll take care of all this stuff, if I can. Oh, please. - I'll see you next Thursday. - All right. Oh, do me a favor and write out what I'm supposed to do in big bold letters. I'll write out your bill in big bold letters. 'Everything helps. 'Hey, wait a second.' - Your purse, ma'am. - Big help. Ah... I know this sounds weird, Theo, but... ...I'm still unable to describe what I'm going through. Have you seen a doctor? A psychiatrist? Come on. You gotta be kidding. I did that for three years. No, no. A regular doctor. An MD. Oh, oh. Yeah, yeah. I'm fine, I'm fine. Listen, there's more. Ahh... the thing that's got me freaked... ...is that... ...these attacks all started three days after the hearing. - Come on... - No, let me finish. Somehow I think McDermott has something to do with all this. Oh, Sal, you gotta be kidding. Oh, no, I'm not kidding. And he's everywhere I go. He's always looking at me and staring at me like I'm some sort of freak. What do you want him to do? When he looks at you, he sees you. So what? I think it's your own projection. Look, Sal, face the facts. You're responsible for killing his granddaughter. Oh, come on! That was an accident! I mean, everybody knows that I was cleared. I know that. Believe me. But that's not the point. We're talking about McDermott, not you. What do you want him to do? Shake your hand and say, "I know it wasn't your fault, Mr. Devito"? Sal, the granddaughter was all he had. He'll never forgive you. I realize that. What am I supposed to do now? Pack my bags and leave town? No, I paid too much dues to get here. - I know it's a tough thing to bear. - Oh, no, you don't. No, no. Sal, when I was doing my lawyer thing, I heard so much of this kind of paranoia that it started to get to me. - That's why I got out of the business. - You can't call it paranoia! - What can I call it, then? - Did you ever kill somebody? - Why? Do I have to? - That's exactly what you have to do. You have to kill somebody to know what I'm going through. Are you fighting again? Don't forget I'm going over to Harriet's tonight, so I might be late, OK? OK, honey. Take care. Oh, Sal, can Jackie come on Friday night? Oh, yeah, yeah. We'll be there. Terrific. Bye. You know who Jackie reminds me of? Uh... remember when we lived on 30th Street? That tall blonde chick you used to go with? What the hell was her name? Uh... I think she had a man's name. Remember? Oh, yeah, yeah. Bradley. Right. Bradley. You still go for the thin blonde type, don't you? Yeah. So how come I married Rose? Pfft. Don't be too hard on yourself. You're in a good place here and you've got some people who really love you. Come on! Give yourself some time. I hope you're right, Theo. Ahh... Look, I gotta get out of here. I gotta get back. - I'll talk to you. - Wait up. I'll walk with you. All right, then. Come on. - Hey... - What? You stay here. - Why? - Stay, stay, stay. - I'm staying, I'm staying. - Yeah, just stay. Oh, come on! This town ain't big enough for the both of us. Don't laugh at me, boy! - Don't laugh at me! - All you Italians,voi siete pazzi. Don't call me crazy, all right? - What? - Go for your gun! I ain't kidding! Ahh... 39-years-old and you're still acting like a kid. Yeah, but I can still beat you to the draw. Have a good day. - Hi, Sal. - How are you doing, Kim? All right. Will that be it? What do you have in mind? - Give me a packet of Vantage. - OK. - Will be 85. - 85? Mmm-hmm. OK. Are you OK? Sal, what's wrong? - Get him something to drink. - One sec, one sec. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Take it easy. - Help. - I'm sorry. - Are you sure you're OK? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what you get for smoking too much. OK. Thanks. You know... Maybe someday... ...I'll stop whining at the bar. Just... Hey, Sal. I thought you were gonna come back up and help. Oh. I'm sorry. I got all tied up. - Yeah? - Mmm. Um, well, it looks super. What are you doing? Oh, just, um, thinking and drinking. - Yeah? - Mmm. Want some company? Yeah. But not here. Let's go to my place. OK. Just give me a minute and I'll run upstairs and lock up the gallery, OK? - I'll meet you outside. - All right. It's on the bar, Franz. You know, people make a fuss over the sauce, but the true secret is in the linguine. - Really? - Yeah. I mean, the only way to cook linguine or any other kind of macaroni is al dente. - Al dente! - Al dente! - Do you know what that means? - Sure. - What? - Oh, let's see. Al dente. Dente is Latin for dentist. - Biting. - Teeth. It's gotta be chewy. Do you get it? Chewy. No. Uh... I mean... see... See, the only way to cook macaroni is not too soft or not too hard. It has to be cooked just right. Henceforth, al dente. - Ah-ha! - Ah-ha! But then what about people with no teeth? Oh, uh... Let them eat noodles, huh? You're definitely a bigot. How can you accept someone without first judging them? Uh... I try to see them, know them for what they are. Without judging. - Alright, take me for instance. - Uh-huh. Now, I'm going through so many changes. How do you know who I'm gonna be from day to day? - Ah, that's not important. - Hmm. I just think that the only thing that really matters is that you understand who you are. Hmm. Wow. Where were you 20 years ago? - Hey, you know who called me today? - No. - My mother. - Again? Yeah. Know the two things she asked me? Did you eat? And did you get your hair cut? Hmm. - That's her life. - I know. And to her that's important. When my mother calls me she asks me in her own subtle way... - Mmm-hmm. - ...when am I gonna get married again. Hmm. To her that's important. Mothers are never subtle. Hmm. - You know, it's funny. - Mmm. Just about a year ago I come home from work one night... - Shh. - ...and I get... What's the matter? Oh... I just flashed on the fact that... ...you know you've been up here for almost a whole year? - Wow. Hmm. - Go on. I'm sorry. Oh, where was I? Uh... a year ago. Oh, right, yeah. I-I was coming home from work. - Mmm-hmm. - A-And I came into the house. And, you know, I saw my oldest daughter Nancy. And, uh, and I looked at her... ...and all of a sudden, you know, I realized that she was no longer... she was no longer a little kid. She was... a grown woman. Looking pretty good, too And I can't tell you the feeling I got. It was like... - Wow. What's going on here? - Come on. Don't change the subject. You're more relaxed right now than you've been in the last couple of weeks. - Really? - Yeah. Really. Hmm. - Go on. - Oh, my God. - What is it? - I burnt all the marshmallows. Sal! - Let's take five. - Oh, yeah. OK. Ooh! - Want one? - No, thanks. - You don't smoke, huh? - Not that, no. Yeah. I shouldn't, either. I gave 'em up nearly ten times in my life. Always had to go back, huh? Whenever there was pressure I went right back. - Pressure? - You never lived in the city, did you? Yeah, I was there for a while once. About three days. Couldn't take it. Had to get out. You see, I... I hate the effect the city has on people. You know... when I first got out here, it was so peaceful I couldn't sleep. I'd become so accustomed to city noises. Thank God for the crickets, I finally got some sleep. - The crickets can make a lot of noise. - Yeah. Listen, uh, you wanna get back to work? Right back to the basics. - Right back to the basics. - Mmm. There you go. Tell me what to do. Tell me what to do! All right, all right. Jesus Christ! All right. All right, calm down. Just stay there. Look... I'm gonna take you to the hospital. - Ow! Ow! - Are you all right? - When I was in the army... - Yeah. ...no matter what happened to us, whether we got our knee cut or our arms broken, they used to give us the same thing. - What was that? - APCs. - What? - Aspirins. Aspirins, huh? - Wish I had a couple of aspirins for you. - So do I. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. ...that's because you own a health food shop. You can sample everything we've got before paying for it. Wait a minute. Somebody's gotta pay for it. Mmm. It looks good. Mmm. That is good. Listen, once you get passed what it looks like, you'll love it. Would you like some? Mmm, uh, yeah. But why don't you sit down? And I'll get it. - Delicious. - You have a big piece. - Sal? - Yeah. Would you mind if I tried something? I'd like to do your tarot cards. - Well, sure. - Are you sure you don't mind? - Not at all. - OK. Sit over there. Hmm. You know the last time I had my tarot cards read was? A little gypsy on 24th Street. - Well, that's another story. - OK. OK. Shuffle those seven times. - Seven times? - Yeah. - By the way, how's Paul doing? - Really good. The doctors say it'll take about a week, then he'll be as good as new. - Well, how's he taking it? - He's disappointed. - Oh, one more time. - Oh, I've lost count. He wishes it had happened during the winter time, so he could've told everybody that it was a skiing accident. - On Mount Mansfield. - I like it! Well, you see, the way I've set the cards up, each one of these sections represents a different area of your life. Uh, this is your home. The other people around you. Work. And you, yourself. This card here represents you. And, uh... around you there is suffering. It's, it's involuntary suffering. And sacrifices that have to be made. But there's a very good woman who's gonna help you through this. Do you know who she is? Well, she could be Jackie. She could be me. I... I don't know. - Hmm. - I don't know. Um... Down here in the home... you can't seem to trust people right now. That's an understatement. This card, the moon, represents Pisces. Um, the lunar influences, change. But in this case it's the brink of a very important change. - Sort of the dark before the dawn. - Mmm-hmm. Or maybe it's the troubles that you're going through right now. What about the...? Oh, oh, the Death card doesn't necessarily represent a physical death. It could mean, uh... a transformation or a change. You see, the four... Um... that card in the middle. Why is it turned over? Um... Well, this card represents the subconscious. And the reason it's turned over is because... ...the subconscious is always hidden. It's the magician. Reversed. He, uh... He represents... forces at work that are beyond your control. Forces that can't be dealt with by the five senses. Mmm. What about this card there? Um... Well, this is, uh... this is an older man... ...who cannot accept the reality of what's happened on a physical level. Um... he-he tends to be creating a lot of deception around you. And you're going to have to have these difficulties with this older man. What about the Page of Wands? Um... Well, as I, as I said before there is a good woman with a lot of vision, who'll help you out of these difficulties and you've got to listen to her. Mmm. How about the Page of Wands? Um... Uh... Well, t-t-the Page of Wands... ...is a child. A-A younger child who has a very close tie with this older man. What are you doing? - Sal... - Shh. - I-I'm sorry. - It's all right. Uh... Let's forget it, huh? I'm gonna get a little air. Excuse me. - Good night. - Good night, Jackie. - And you tell Mrs. Baineswaite. - OK. According to Lesley and her bubble-gum cards, I'm gonna need a priest. - Hey, come on. - Good night. Bye. Lesley... what was that all about? What? What? For Christ's sakes, the man has enough problems without you adding your forecast of gloom. I... I didn't interpret the cards. I just read what I saw. Why the hell did you do it? I had to warn him. Warn him? Warn him about what? Theo... I've been doing Sal's readings for the last three days now. And those cards you saw tonight have been coming up in almost the same pattern. Only they've never been this bad before. Look, y-y-you tell him about McDermott, you tell him about the kid. I mean, why the hell did you read his cards in the first place? Because I've been... I've been getting this pull about him. I-I-I just don't understand it. Well, if you don't understand it, why are you playing around with it? Listen, three days ago, he came to me. He told me the same things you read in the cards tonight. - He did? - Yes. I-I really think Sal's problems are starting to get to all of us. - Yeah, but something... - Please. Why don't you go up to bed? I'll clean up. What did he say? He said I'm all right. Just a little hyper. - Tranquilizers? - Just like my dog. It's all right. I'll be right back. You gotta a lot of work to do tonight. Excuse me, Mr. McDermott. Can I talk to you a minute? Excuse me. Excuse me. Can I talk to you a minute, Mr. McDermott? Look, all I want... Look, Mr. McDermott... All I wanna do is talk to you, just for a second. Will you just listen to me? Could you just listen a minute? Look... Mr. McDermott... What can I say? I'm sorry. How many times do you want me apologize about your granddaughter's death? Look, I'm warning you, McDermott. What do you want me to do? I want you to leave me alone. And I'm gonna tell you something else. That goes for your friend, too, hanging out at my house. Just have him stay away from me, or... Why don't you listen to him? Why don't you put your ears where your eyes are? Why didn't you listen to him? Why didn't somebody listen to him? What, am I talking to a wall? Yeah, you're right? Are you all right? Come on. Anyone got a problem? I wanna hear it now, if you do. OK, then. Party's over. Let's go home. - Can I go now? - Yes. Everybody can go. OK. You're all right, huh? Yeah. Mr. Devito, can I see you for a minute? You're causing a lot of concern for our town's people. You're causing a lot of... a lot of grief for the old man. - What about the grief he's causing me? - Such as? S... Ah, what's the point of all this? Well, I suggest take it easy and, uh... - You know, the man's getting very old. - Yeah. - You understand? - Yeah, I understand. I thought you would. Why don't you go on home? Yeah, OK. OK. I'll see you back later on. Uh, Paul said you wanted to see me. What's up? Uh, is-is Sal all right? I've been trying to call him. - Oh, he's fine. Why? - I heard about the fight. - It was strange. - What happened? I don't know. I mean, one minute I'm sitting next to him and the next minute he's fighting with McDermott. I don't understand it. 'He's yelling and screaming at the old man like some kind of a... maniac. 'And he turns around and he hits him.' 'Jackie, I've got to take Sal to see someone who can help him.' 'Who?' Adrianna Putnam. Hmm. You're not serious? I know, I know what you're thinking. She's got a reputation for being a witch. A nut. A maniac. But she isn't any of those things. She's a psychic. Lesley. Come on, please. No more mysticism. Adrianna really thinks that she can help him. Well, first of all, I don't think you're gonna get Sal to go see her. Do you have an explanation for what's going on? No, I don't, but I certainly can't buy witchcraft. 'Can't you see that something is happening 'that he has no control over?' No, no, no! No! No! Hello? Oh. Hello, Rose. How are you? Hmm. Yeah. OK. Yeah, everything's fine. Yeah. Listen, how are the kids? Uh, Ro, hmm, you may not believe this, but, uh, I really do still care. Yes. Ro, why do you do this to me? Every time you call we get into the exact same thing. Yeah, but... Rose... I know what my responsibilities are, Rose. I really do. I know you don't believe that. I mean, I-I-I feel stupid saying it. But I know! Yeah. Look, Rose, don't start with me already. Look. Look... Rose. Do what you want. All right? I-I... Do what you want, OK? If you want a divorce, get it. If you don't want it... It doesn't matter to me. Look, Rose, I know what my responsibilities are. Please don't hang that crap on me! I know! You've heard the word before! Yeah. All right. Yeah. I... Look, Rose... We've been over this. We tried. I know you tried hard. I tried, but... You don't understand that's... That kind of life is just not in me. I mean, I can't live that kind of... station-wagon existence. I just can't. Yeah, I know. Yeah, I know I never grew up. Yeah. I mean, don't remind me. I know in two years I'll be 40. And that's exactly the reason why I'm taking my shot. What do you want from me? Goddamn it! What do you want from me? It's so good to see you. This is Sal Devito. Oh, yes. The man you were telling me about. - How do you do? - And Jackie Currant. Nice to meet you Come in. Come in. Oh, and I brought you something that you really love. - Pumpkin seeds? - Uh-huh. Oh, bless you. Oh, would you like something to drink? How about some tea? - Not for me, thanks. - Oh, I'd like some. - Oh, I'll make it. - All right. It's, um, on the top shelf. I know exactly where it is. Jackie Currant? Ah, aren't you the young lady who owns the little gallery? - Mmm, yes. - Oh, I've been in there a few times. - It's lovely. - Oh, thank you. I wish I could afford some of your pictures. Come on. Come on. Sit down. I thought I'd given these to you. Oh, thank you. I have an absolute passion for pumpkin seeds. - Have some. - Thank you. - Would you like some? - Oh, no, thanks. - Mmm. - You have a very good friend in Lesley. She's told me what's been happening to you. Well, I don't know what you're gonna do. Well, maybe I can help you. You're surrounded by very powerful negative forces. I could feel them the minute you walked into the room. Look, I'm perspiring, but it's from your energies. Maybe I better explain a few things. There are four elements that go into making up our... our existence. There's fire, earth, air and water. Plus, a fifth one called the life force. - Excuse me. May I...? - Oh, yeah. Sure. - Careful. They stick in your throat. - I know. These five elements come together to form seven different levels. The first of these is called the lower astral plane. It's from that plane that someone who knows how can direct his power to let loose the forces of evil and disturb the balance. When that happens these forces have to be balanced out. Um... describe the figure you've been seeing. Uh... Uh... It's funny. I-I... I can't. Well try. Uh, was it, uh, tall, short? Uh... yeah. He was tall. Oh, it had the shape of a man. Well, of course it had the shape of a man. What else could he be? Look, you must understand, Mr. Devito that these forces can materialize in many different forms. - Excuse me... - No, wait, wait. Are you saying, then, that... ...what I'm seeing is a demon? Yes. Or what we call a thought form. Um... Adrianna, do you know Ned McDermott? Yes. Is he capable of doing that? Look, anyone can cast spells. But it's very dangerous. Can you remember where you saw the figure the very first time? Yeah. It was my house. No. Uh, no, it wasn't, no. It was, uh... my studio. Right. - Are you sure? - Yeah. All right. Take these. It'd help if you could memorize that. Stand near the place where you first saw the demon and say the incantation out loud. And take this in your right hand. And when the fire reaches its full height... ...throw the vial into it. What... what fire? In order to rid yourself of this haunt, you must burn your studio to the ground. Turn them off! Let it burn! Let it burn! Let it burn! - 4-11 to 4-10. - '4-10.' We have one suspect under arrest at the fire scene. Mr. Devito... you forgot your belongings. - It's just a misdemeanour. - OK. Alright. Thank you, officer. Um... Why don't you go ahead with Theo? Uh... there's something I gotta do first. Sure. See you, Jackie. Theo... can we sit for a minute? Sure, man. Whatever. Oh, the air smells sweet here. It's not like the city, is it? No. Nothing like the city. Sal, is there anything I can do? I mean, whatever you want me to do. Uh... Hello? Mr. McDermott? Anybody home? Help! Help! Help! No, no, no! No, no, no! No, no! What do I do now? You must bring your friend here. Tonight. I-I... I-I-I don't know if he'll come back here. And-and bring Lesley and Theo, too. I-I-I... I'm gonna need all of your energies to balance this thing out. I don't wanna frighten you, all right? I-I know you don't know what you're dealing with, but I'm just as much involved as you are. Look, I assumed responsibility for your friend the moment I agreed to see him. My intention when he came here was to let him protect himself. He wasn't ready to let me help him. Then why did you tell him to burn down his studio? What I told him to do was right. I just didn't think he was gonna do it. But he was thrown in jail because of what you told him to do. Look, you tell your friend what he tried to do was only the first step. The fact that he didn't succeed doesn't matter. What's important is that he tried. Now we must help him. I want to, but I can't... I-I... just can't go through the motions of something I don't understand. But can't you see the fact that this exists and that you brought it here to me means you need my help. Now follow your instincts, girl. They're good. Trust me. The only thing that's important right now is for you to bring him here. 'Our Father, who art in heaven 'Hallowed be thy name 'Thy kingdom come 'Thy will be done 'On earth as it is in heaven 'Give us this day our daily bread 'And forgive us our trespasses 'As we forgive those who trespass against us 'And lead us not into temptation 'But deliver us from evil 'For thine is the kingdom 'And the power 'And the glory 'For ever and ever 'Amen.' You must unite together with me in mind and emotion and your total being. So we must build the psychic power to transform the negative energy imprisoned in that wax image. All the power that ever was, all the power that ever will be is here right now. All the power that ever was, all the power that ever will be is here right now.
