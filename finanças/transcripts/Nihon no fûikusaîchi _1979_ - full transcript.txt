1979 Arts Festival Entry existing organizations is merely coincidental. Toei Movie Company LTD., Presents Banzai! New president of the People's Party Hirayama. Banzai. Thank you. Thank you. President. Yourfeelings on the miraculous come-from-behind win. The times demand it. The people must be tired of the same old bureaucratic politics. It's been 30 years since the war. Everyone wants to live a little. There's a rumor that you bought the Nishimoto factions' 20 votes for 2 million. That's defamation I'm outraged. That's defamation. I'm outraged. Politicians who spread malicious rumors are not worthy of their high offices. They're an embarrassment to our country. - President! - One more question. That's enough. Let's do the banzai again. His Excellency Eikichi Hirayama... Banzai! Thank you. Thank you. I'll do my best. Here's a cold towel. Oh, lots of presents. Sir, this is from Mr. Komei Yamaoka. That's a splendid sword. It probably qualifies as a national treasure since it's from Mr. Yamaoka. Congratulations for becoming the new president. Mr. Yamaoka, I've achieved a milestone, thanks to you. And this wonderful gift. I know exactly what you want to say. If I don't meet your expectations, I'll commit seppuku like a man, with this short sword. You now hold Japan and the fate of 100 million Japanese in your hands. But the extreme leftist faction is on the rise and Japan will be controlled by communists. The only one who can save Japan and clean up the corrupt conservative politics is a patriot like you. I'm counting on you. Don't forget that I'll continue to back you up. NIHON NO FIXER (The Fixer) Summer - Two Years Later Komei Yamaoka, commit seppuku. Yamaoka. Commit seppuku now. Not good. The prosecutor's office and tax agency are still searching the compound. Too many cops. The radical students are coming this way. Could we use that? Brother, the demonstration's approaching. What are you going to do? - Shall we go, too. - Idiot! His elite private army is protecting the garden. They'll eat us alive. We have to get Yamaoka with one shot. We can't fail. Master? Master Imaizumi? What's the matter? Oh no! This is Father's favorite. Did this happen today? I don't know. The government should pay for this. I don't care if they're the law. They barge in here. They're breaking the law. Violation of the Foreign Exchange Act and tax evasion. That's true. It was an ambush. Special Investigation Unit is impatient. Although Hirayama and Leader's name came up in the American investigation, there's no evidence in Japan. Maybe they thought he had a pile of money buried under the floor. Kaga. How's Leader's mood? The same as usual. That's good. So the next step is an interview downtown? - By the police? - No way. If they come after Leader, the sitting Prime Minister would be in trouble. He can use his authority to stop the prosecutor's investigation. It's not only politicians who have authority. Isn't that so, Captain? It's going to get worse. Be prepared. Thank you for your patience today. Not at all. You, too. And where is our leader? He's in the shrine room, so he won't come down. Then, we'll leave without saying good-bye. Thank you, everyone. Don't let your guard down. Attention. At ease. Count off. All is well. Yamaoka! And you are? Identify yourself. Die! Idiot! Let me go! He's our enemy. He ruined Japan. Wait. Don't kill him. - Sir! - Dear! Dear! Dear! Damn it. Sir! Sir! An ambulance went in from the service entrance. What happened? What's going on? Yamaoka was attacked. And? He wasn't killed. But it triggered a heart attack. All the big shots have been summoned. If an ambulance was called, they'll probably take him to Tokyo Hospital. The hospital director, Motoyama, is his doctor. This may be our chance. All right. We'll get him on the way. Stop. A person life is at stake. Let us through. Will the right wing boss hide in the hospital like a yakuza boss? Public opinion won't allow it. What's the matter? The ambulance hasn't come yet. The press and onlookers won't let it pass. They're broadcasting it live on TV. Stop it! Please stop. They'll kill my husband. Go back to the house. Please. Go back! Damn kid! Now tell us. Who ordered you to attack him? Kill me. Go ahead. That's enough. He's just a hoodlum. You must review your security. A better man should guard the leader. Someone. Come quick. Someone! Someone! Someone! Fool! Call a doctor! Takeo! Imaizumi thinks it's entirely his fault. I relayed yourwords so I don't think he'll do anything foolish. The wound is deep and penetrated his intestines. But he refuses to go to the hospital. He said he'd bite his tongue and die if he's taken outside the compound. I think he shouldn't be around you for a while. Chairman Oguri said he'd choose a new bodyguard foryou. That's not necessary. Takeo's fine. Yes, Sir. Dear? Do you know Heikichi Hamatani from Yamagata? He's come to see howyou are. He said he worked underyou during the war in China. He looks to be in his seventies. If he's one of my men from that time, I'd like to see him. Let him through. This way. He's upstairs. It's no wonder you don't remember such an insignificant man like me. You saved me when I was being attacked by thugs in Shanghai. Oh, did I? Please relax. Ever since then, you let me work on the periphery of your group allowing me to work for our country. Are you the one who sent me a letter and rice, saying you were returning to your home to become a farmer? Yes. Thank you. That rice was delicious. There was very little to eat then, it was greatly appreciated. Thank you for saying that. The letter you wrote me then has become our family heirloom and has a place of honor in our home. Sir? I heard on the news this morning that you collapsed, and I couldn't sit still. I did some checking on my own about this awful incident. Everything has been orchestrated by Ogouchi, head of the Kansai Kyoshin Rengo. It's an open secret that Ogouchi has been planning to expand into Kanto and is planning your overthrow. I hear it was also Ogouchi's idea to emphasize your involvement and make you look guilty at the American Senate hearing into the Randolph Corporation. Sir? Is there anything I can do to help? I will do anything you ask. Will you not retaliate? I appreciate your offer but times have changed. We can't do things the old way. Is that how you really feel? The way to accomplish what you believe in has always been to act without saying. What are the thousands of your disciples doing? No matter what public opinion says, everything is going as I planned. Hamatani. I won't lose. Osaka Sawai, what's going on? It's been two months since we sent them to Tokyo. They've done nothing but cost me money. I'm so sorry. As you know from the papers, if the ambulance hadn't been blocked by the press and had been able to proceed to the hospital... You're not aggressive enough. I hearyou're directing Mizumaki by wireless. You can't do a proper job like that. Why don't you volunteerfor Yamaoka's elite army unit and help them from the inside? I'll do better. I'll get results soon. Oh, Boss. The chairman is here. Morishima, how is Yamaoka doing? He's pretty bad. But even with one foot in the grave, as long as he's alive, he's dangerous. Are you going to do it? I've made arrangements. Make sure it doesn't come back to us. I know that. I'll make it look like dissention inside the right wing faction. That's fine. An interesting young man. He's saying he won't eat anything tainted by dirty American money? When I was his age, I didn't eat for three days in prison. Shouldn't we get rid of him? He won't tell us his name or his affiliation. I don't think he'll be useful to us. How is your injury? It's better now. You life is not yours alone. Don't forget that. Go see how he's doing. You. You. I hearyou've only taken water. You'll die. Do you want to die? You're going to kill me anyway. Will you let me escape? No. Run. The door's open. - Why are you letting me go? - Go quickly. - Stop! - Stop! He's beautiful. You used to look like that. You'd get mad because they said you were Father's boy toy. But he's very different from you. He tried to kill Father. What is Father going to do with him? What do you think? I don't know. Father. How is he? They gave him something to make him sleep. He must be dreaming. It must be a sad dream... Ikko. Remember, your name is Ikko. I give you that name. From now on, you're a different person. Understand? You're a man. You'll be fine soon. But you have to eat. You can't do battle if you don't eat. Takeo. You're in charge of Ikko. I'll talk to the disciples. But he might try again. I'll do it. Director Satake was a very responsible person. We feel he committed suicide because he felt responsible for the Randolph Corporation situation. It was so sudden so we're still not sure of the facts, but Vice President Asakura was Satake's direct superior. He will make a statement. As vice president in charge of machinery, I've been handling the import of aircraft for a very long time. Satake was in charge of all dealings with Randolph. Deputy director Muramoto will agree with me. Regarding the purchase of third generation FX aircraft, there have been reports in the press that I asked Homei Yamaoka to lobby the government and he received a large kickback for the success of the deal from Randolph. But I have never met Mr. Yamaoka to this day. Furthermore, about the 2 million in political contributions purported to have gone from Mr. Yamaoka to Prime Minister Hirayama, I had nothing to do with it. Welcome. This is the bag Director told us to hold for him. Here's the key. I haven't touched it. Too scary. Welcome. This is from VP Asakura. I'll take it. Though I don't feel good about it. Everyone's saying... that Directorwas killed by Mr. Asakura. That's nonsense. But Mr. Asakura profits most by his death. He can lay all the blame on the director. I'm going now. - Thank you. - Come again. Chief, get in. We'll give you a ride. I'll take a cab. I insist. What are you going to do with me? I want to exchange that bag with mine. I think you can retire comfortably with this. Who are you? East... or West? East and West? If you asked Right of Left, I could have replied. This is thorough. It lists the politicians' names and the amounts. Daiwa Trading and the political world's unsavory tie has been going on since the former Ito cabinet ten years ago. The money Hirayama received is just loose change. I wonder how Leader will use this. If the bomb is too powerful, we'll all go down. It's me, Sawai. I brought you some gyoza. My husband hasn't returned from Osaka. So this is all I have. How long do we have to stay here? Until we have information that Yamaoka is leaving the mansion. He said that Yamaoka's elite guards are extra cautious and checking all the cars that come near the house. I'm leaving. Everyone, please hang on. It won't be long. Hey. I hope Sawai hasn't changed his mind. - Has he gotten cold feet? - No. It's really dangerous. I hope you're right... No! Stop! Tell Sawai for me. I don't know about the right wing, but he shouldn't underestimate the yakuza. We're not afraid of death. We've staked our lives. I have children... Damn, you were followed. Is she Sawai's wife? Bring her. I hear you once worked for Morishima of Kyoshin Rengo? Yes, when I lived in Osaka. Was it money? I'm sorry. Do you want to make this right? Yes, I'll do anything. I don't knowwhat Morishima's planning, but if he contacts you, do what you've been doing but report everything to Miyaguchi. We'll keep you wife for a while. My wife... It's all up to you. I envy young people. Beautiful. Takeo. Let's go on a trip. A trip? I have a premonition. If you stay here any longer, my fatherwill kill you. I'm sure of it. Men in this house are all hothouse flowers and can live only under Father's light. It's fine for those who revere him like a god. But you don't. You can kill yourself, but you can't kill another for Father. Look at that child. Just one light. Understand? That's the name Father gave him. He's the mirror image of my father. Father saw that at once. Oh, Madam. My husband wants you to join him for tea. We'll be there right away, Mother. This is a good time. Why don't we tell Father about us? He'll get very angry. Why? Because I'm an orphan, parentage unknown. But we can't hide it forever. If Father gets angry, we can leave this house together. How's Ikko doing? I've urged him to mix with the disciples. He seems to be in a world of his own. But that child seems to like it here. There's no sign he wants to escape. Keep your eyes on him. Father? I have something to tell you. About Takeo and I. Are you pregnant? Dear? You knew. Well? What was that about? But I'm glad. I was worried about you two. But it's the same as he's given approval, so let's set a date soon. What's wrong, Masako? You know nothing about him. What do you mean? That look. Look? I can tell. There's something... Something. Please have a seat. Vice Secretary Tsunuma of the People's Party. Mr. Yamaoka, it's been a while. I heard you were unwell. Please sit. I apologize for disturbing you so late. But this is urgent. We heard the prosecutor's office and the special investigation division of the police will forcibly conduct a bedside interrogation. Associate prosecutor Suzumura, who's in charge of the investigation, is a feared prosecutor with an incredible conviction record. We tried many tactics to protect you but he can't be stopped. So unfortunately, we'd like you to issue your retirement statement. That's the only way to deflect the investigation. Of course, it would only be a temporary retirement. Perhaps if you leave this place and move to your villa in Hakone... The police would have made their point. We'll take care of the rest. If the past is anything to go on, these incidents are forgotten in less than a year. What do you think? You have a right to be angry. But the tide is against us and the situation is dire. Sir, please understand the position we're in. Special Investigations have declared their intent to arrest you. Mr. Tsunuma. Do you think I'll talk? Er, no. Of course not. Who do you think I am? I'm sorry. Prime Minister Hirayama is now standing on the edge of a cliff. Former Prime Minister Ito and the anti-Hirayama faction are colluding with the opposition party and plotting not only to have him resign, but to end his political career. I beg you to understand this dire situation. Hirayama and I are inextricably linked. I know that. If I retire, those blameless will be blamed. Hirayama knows this. I'll be his shield and stop all arrows aimed at Hirayama. Hirayama will stick by his conviction. There's no need for you underlings to play petty tricks. Please leave. Hamatani had no kin norfamily. Go to Osaka and claim his body and give him a respectable funeral. The police will ask questions especially now. I don't think your name should be mentioned. I don't care. Did Mr. Hamatani go to Osaka to kill Ogouchi of Kyoshin Rengo? We don't knowyet. What is Mr. Hamatani's background? The newspaper said he was a ultranationalist of the pre-war era. The pre-war patriotism movement called for individual action. and did not go in for group action like now. They did not do demonstrations or use propaganda trucks. - So it was all action? - You mean terrorism? Don't talk, don't shout, don't show. Just stab in silence. Just strike, just stab, just shoot. - Just kill one person. - Yes, kill one person. But our leader always says, in pre-war Japan, if you eliminated one bad powerful person, you could change the world. Now, even if you felled a thousand men, you can't destroy the roots of misgovernment. You mean terrorism has lost its meaning? Then what must we do to make the world better? What about the things we learned? All you have to do is to believe in Mr. Yamaoka. That's all. What are you doing? Newspaper clippings... I saw it a long time ago, an article about Father when he was in China. Don't you remember? We burned everything to do with Leader at Mr. Kaga's instruction. Burned? When the house was searched. Even that? How very cautious. Why are you searching for it? I wanted to check your identity. That article was about the end of the war. You know that when he returned from China he brought back just you and I. I know that. I asked Father many times about you. But he wouldn't tell me anything. Yet he knows everything about us. There must be a reason. Don't you want to know who you are? You! Come here. Can't you hear me? - Ikko has a bad leg. - So what? You. Don't you get it? The reason you're safe is all due to Leader's kindness. I'm going to beat your rotten ways out of you. Come. Here. You! - Ikko! - Ikko. Leave him alone. Coward. Hey, get back to practice. An ugly duckling. Will he really become a swan? Show me. Chairman. Is it true Daiwa Trading is holding their stockholder meeting in Osaka? Ever since the Randolph incident, Daiwa Trading wants to cut ties with Seizan Club. It's the joint effort of vice president Asakura and Morishima of Kyoshin Rengo. They disrespect us. We can't ignore it. If Kyoshin Rengo gets Daiwa, other industry groups will all lean towards Kansai. Chairman. Let me handle this. Even if I have to shed a lot of blood, I won't let Kansai have his way. Maybe we should ask Captain Dan for help. I'm Daiwa's chief executive secretary. I'll handle this alone. Kyoto Madam, beautiful as always. You're as glib as ever. Asakura. This Madam was the number one hostess in Gion until recently. But Ogouchi here put the moves on her and made her all his own. He's the kind who gets his own way, with woman or anything if he wants it. I've always heard stories about you. But I'm no longer as virile as I used to be. Recently, I'm getting closer and closer to joining the Buddha. If you're the Buddha, what are we? You are gods. You, Mr. Ito, are more god than elder statesman. They say go pray to Ito when you have a problem. That's an overstatement. Make yourself at home. Ogouchi, Yamaoka will be arrested. Oh, yes? For violating foreign exchange laws and for tart evasion. They'll arrest everyone in Seizan Club. What will happen to Prime Minister Hirayama? I'll have him resign. He's finished. We already picked a successor. I'm going to have to rely on you again. Leave all money matters to me. Is it all right to arrest Yamaoka? If he talks... There's no worry there. You may not understand, but the conviction that the man lives by is that even if cut off a limb, he will not talk. On the other hand, he doesn't mind shutting other people up. Ogouchi. You must make sure Asakura is safe. Yamaoka probably knows Asakura is here. - He can't possibly. - Don't worry. All right, Morishima? I am in your hands. In addition to Daiwa, about 120 associated companies would like to be affiliated with Mr. Ogouchi. You have nothing to worry about. You will not regret it. - How about another bar? - Oh, not tonight. Don't say that. Next time. - You first. - Thank you. Morishima! I'm fine. Don't let that punk escape. Prosecutor Suzumura We knowfrom the shooter's testimony it was you who gave the orders to attack Morishima. The police said so, too, but I have no knowledge of this. It's no use denying it. When Daiwa's stockholder meeting was held in Osaka, your demand to see Morishima was denied. You were heard yelling at your men to get Morishima. I was very drunk. No matter how hard you try to get out of it, you'll be charged with murder solicitation. When the antagonism between Yamaoka and Ogouchi incites petty yakuza wars, people will feel unsafe. The police want to throw the book at you. But I'm different. Punishing you won't stop the war between East and West. If you cooperate with us, I'm willing to look the other way about this incident. That's because we know very well that you are a victim. You were driven to this by Chairman Oguri and Yamaoka. The leadership of Seizan Club have worked hard to create funds for Yamaoka. We know you were laundering illicit money from trading companies. Hold on there, Prosecutor. I know what you're doing. You're trying to use me to corner Mr. Yamaoka. But it won't work. No matter how hard you try, you'll get nothing. So, take me back to the police. Don't say that. Take a look at this. I had them check the amount. You didn't pay taxes on the year before last. According to the tax agency, the interest and penalty alone will be more than a million dollars. One million! That's absurd. It can't be helped. Because more than 2 million passed through your account and disappeared. This is so stupid. All because you temporarily parked someone else's money. It's good to be loyal but you yourself will have to pay. I have nothing to do with this. I've never heard about this money. Prosecutor, tell the tax agency they can take whatever they want, even my life. Yamaoka should commit seppuku, apologize to the country. You mustn't... Sorry to keep you waiting. Here's my diagnosis. I think he's in grave danger. It's stress-related high blood pressure and a worsening heart disease. There's a good change he'll have a heart attack. You'll have to postpone your bedside interrogation. How long until his condition stabilizes? I have to keep him under observation. If it was up to me, I'd hospitalize him. I'll just pay my respects. He's under sedation. That's fine. I want to confirm that. Go ahead. This is his wife. Mr. Yamaoka. Mr. Yamaoka? Apologies for the intrusion. Take a look at this. You wrote this? Did you write this yourself? Well. Answer me. Yes. Don't your trust me? Dates, amounts... even my name. How mercenary! I didn't think our relationship was based on money. Who do you think I am? I am sorry. How did you get this? It must be Yamaoka. Kato, who sent this, is in the pocket of the Ittosha's Dan, a scandal journalist. Because Yamaoka has people like him in his pocket, he's dangerous. Asakura, I don't care howyou do it, you have to get the original back from Yamaoka. Yes, of course. But why did Yamaoka send this to you? He's trying to save Hirayama's political career. At this juncture, this throws a wrench into our plans. Because of you, Hirayama's doesn't look as guilty. Mr. Asakura. I got a call from Dan's representative. Regarding that memo, neitherYamaoka or Seizan Club has any knowledge of it. That's not possible. Muramoto, who worked for the deceased Director Satake, disappeared with that memo. He was found dead in Hong Kong. You must have read it in the papers. That was Yamaoka's doing. Mr. Asakura. We didn't think it was easy. Now that they've made the first move, they'll contact us again with their demands. So don't get impatient. We just have to wait. You guys know who's the real villains? They're politicians. Isn't that right? They get the perks without getting their hands dirty. Compared to them, Yamaoka is a prince. He, at least makes his position clear. I, too, am covered in dirt. I'm really pissed. Have a good rest, Vice President. Don't let anyone in. I'll come to wake you at nine tomorrow morning. All rights? What? You're leaving? Let's drink some more. Daiwa Trading's VP Asakura's death has been ruled a suicide. He's been depressed since Director Satake's suicide. But wild rumors are going around. Daiwa Trading and their associated companies are in shock. About a hundred of them had left Seizan Club and were allying with the west. We've received a second summons from the Diet's special committee investigating the Randolph Corporation. The date is the 18th of next month. This time, President Mori of Daiwa Trading and Prime Minister Hirayama are scheduled to testify. We'll decline with Doctor Motoyama's note. Hey, stop daydreaming. What are you doing here? My father is asking for you. Where is he? In the bath. His air of menace is astounding. It seems to take him like a sudden fever. Is he still planning to kill father? What did Leaderwant? He wanted Ikko to wash his back. Does that botheryou? Or are you jealous? Leader. Oh, a blackout. The whole neighborhood is out. Where's Yamaoka? Take me to him. Hurry. What's going on? Who are you? Leader, are you all right? Are you? Yes. Go purify yourself. Ikko. What's the matter? Go help Takeo. Pull yourself together. Masako. It's for Takeo. Take my formal kimono to him. Save him the embarrassment. Are you Mr. Sawai? This way. Kayoko. Kayoko... Are you her husband? This was in her purse. Was she murdered? We don't know. Judging from her wounds, it's likely a hit and run. She was buried to hide her body, but the rain... She was murdered. Murdered! They killed her. Killed her... Yourfavorite white porcelain by Nanso, it was broken. Takeo came to apologize. It was self defense, so he'll be back soon. I'll go to greet him. - No. - Why not? You must not leave this house. I don't care about public opinion. I'll go see Takeo, then we'll both go on a trip. I won't let you control Takeo. That's so like you, Father. You may think we're all your slaves, but not all of us will obey you. Takeo is my son... by a different woman. What? Takeo is your younger brother. No! You're lying. Takeo's mother was a Chinese. Before we came back to Japan, I killed her. If I didn't, we'd have all been beaten to death. There was only one seat on the plane back to Japan. Your mother put both you and Takeo in my arms and took my army sword. There are those who say as a coward, because I was the only one who survived. But only the dead know how I really feel. I was going to tell you one of these days... But you can't tell anyone, most of all Takeo. Why? Why were you silent all this time? Why didn't you tell me sooner? Before Takeo and I got involved. Look at this Jishu urn. Chinese artisans tried to produce a pure white color for hundreds of years and finally this was the result. The same can be said for human beings. My blood is tainted. So I'm resigned if I can't make Japan an ideal country in my lifetime. But one day, someone who is a better patriot than I will come along and save Japan. But that person must have my completely purified blood flowing through his veins. So you saw us as a tool to create a successor for you. You don't think we're human. The love between a man and woman only has meaning when they have a son. I'm not responsible for the feelings between you two. A life coming into this world must be celebrated. I'm glad I didn't have the child. What? Once, I was pregnant with Takeo's child. You... If I had that child, I couldn't forgive him. Shut up. I would have killed that child. Shut up! Kill me. I want to see with my own eyes, howyou killed Mother and the others. Masako! Answer me. Are you going to have Takeo's child? Will you bearTakeo's son? Father, you're mad. Leader. What? Mr. Hirayama is resigning. The Chief Cabinet Secretary announced that there'll be an important statement at 8 p.m. tonight. There was a discussion between the three elders.= Ito, Tokumitsu and Yasuda and they're pretty set on Foreign Minister Kunieda. Leader! Leader. I'm all right. Put a call through to Hirayama. Now. Keep calling until Hirayama answers the phone. I said keep calling. Hakone Regarding the matter agreed upon in the presence ofTokumitsu, Yasuda and Ogouchi, we swear that we will cooperate to make it happen. Ryosaku Ito, Eikichi Hirayama, Yoshio Kunieda, Takehiko Nishimoto. Will this do? That's fine. Then... Even if Kunieda and Nishimoto serve out their term, in six years, it will be your turn. You're still young. I'll learn as much as I can from behind the scenes, with Mr. Ogouchi as my mentor. You won't be bored. Real politics is done behind the scenes. Excuse me. I'm Sawai from Giretsusha. Please let me see Mr. Yamaoka. Not today. Come back another time. Please. Welcome home. I'm sorry I couldn't go to greet you. I had a cold. Leader. Leader. I'm sorry to have troubled you. Takeo. Please. Just for today, please do what I say. Please, make love to me. What's the matter? You're acting strangely. Takeo, you know. That you and I are brother and sister. That you are Homei Yamaoka's son. Well? For a while, sometime's I'd have this feeling... but I didn't know until today, when Leader embraced me. Is that what they call blood? But pity you. No matter howyou feel, Father has no fatherly love foryou. He was using us to bear him an heir as though we were breeding horses. Do you know what that means? You do, don't you? For us to become human again, we have to leave this house. I thought long and hard. But I can't forget you. Even if we are siblings, since we loved each other as a man and a women, even the gods can't tear us apart. Takeo? Let's take our chances out there. If I'm with you, I'm not afraid of anything. I can't leave this house. Why not? We're as good as husband and wife. The old Takeo Imaizumi is dead. The man in front of you is a different man who can't live without Leader's light. That's sophistry. Are you that afraid of Father? I want to serve Leader by his side. You, too, cast me aside when I'm no longer useful to you. Just like Father let our mothers die. What do you and Father think women are? Do you think that men are the only ones that count? Don't sneak up on me like a thief. Leader is calling. All right. Takeo? Must you go? I'm not going to let Homei Yamaoka win. I'll get you back. To Eikichi Hirayama Takeo. Please deliver this to Mr. Hirayama. You must get the answer from him personally. What is that? There's nothing written there. Yamaoka is telling me to die. No! This is a pronouncement of the death penalty. Are you Imaizumi? I'm a Yamaoka disciple Takeo Imaizumi. I did read the letter from Mr. Yamaoka. I want you to tell Mr. Yamaoka how I feel. Today, circumstances have arisen beyond my control that compel me to break my promise to Mr. Yamaoka. This is all in preparation for a comeback and I have not gone back on my fidelity to him. But I am returning this to him. Please leave. Chuck that in the sewer. Leader. May I have this sword? Imaizumi. Wait. What are you planning to do, Imaizumi? I was soft. I should have killed him right then and there. No. What would happen to Leader if you do? But... Hirayama betrayed and insulted Leader. This isn't like you. Please. Let me go. What's going on? It's like you want to die. Look. Your job is to protect Leader. As long as Leader is alive and well Yamaoka castle will neverfall. I'll keep this. Kaga. Go summon Oguri and the others. Thanks for coming. I'm going to testify in the Diet. Official Summons Homei Yamaoka I don't understand. What is Leader thinking? That committee is a kangaroo court. It's probably because of Hirayama's resignation. It's not for us to know what Leader's thinking. I'm opposed to this. As one of his disciples, I can't stand the idea that my honored teacher will be humiliated in public. What's more, he's deceiving the prosecutors using his health as an excuse. If things go badly, they'll take him straight to prison. I agree. If the executive committee votes "no," wouldn't Leader give up this plan? Chairman? Call for a vote. Leader's appearance in the Diet is already set. This meeting is to prepare and plan, not for deliberation. But we should deliberate. Even Leader is not always right. Ryuzaki! Say that again. I'll say it again and again. If this committee disregards my opinion, I'll... Ieave Seizan Club. Leader is most worried about internal unrest. With the regime change, criticism against the Yamaeka group is getting stronger. In fact, the Chairman and I have received summons from the police. We must all pull together and present a united front. That's the only way we can protect Leader. This isn't good. The order to stop Yamaoka form appearing in the Diet is a direct order from Ito and Hirayama. I was counting on you. I'm sorry. I opposed because I thought it would not serve Leader well. Oguri and the others are crazy. Never mind. Let's have a drink. You always get the short end of the stick, even being arrested for murder. Your guest is here. Please bring him here. Oh, sorry, sorry to be late. The stupid bullet train was late again. Oh, Ryuzaki, long time. Mr. Tsunuma. What's the meaning of this? I wanted you and Morishima to shake hands. I had him come all the way from Osaka. Let's go, Takemura. Stop. This is too much. Ryuzaki, the reason I had the prosecutor let you go as because of this. Why can't you listen to me for once? Ryuzaki. I'm going to be very frank, Kansai style. My research show that inside the Seizan Club, there's 16 associations you personally support, isn't that so? So as a fee for switching to Kyoshin Rengo, 100,000 dollars for each for the 16 groups... for a total of 1.6 million dollars. Please accept it. It's not a bad deal. I gatheryou're short on cash. Aren't you underestimating Oguri? You know it will be war. Yes, I suppose it will be. What's your objective? It's the split up of Seizan Club, of course. For good measure, when war comes... the cops... the police will move using public order as an excuse to stop Yamaoka's appearance in the Diet. Ryuzaki. The Yamaoka group is hanging by a thread. The sooner the better, to leave them. It's not just Ito. Even Hirayama is now Ougouchi's camp. Ryuzaki. I'll guarantee your safety. I've arranged for at least 500 men to come in as an advance team. I've shown you all my cards. You have to say yes. Who are you? Captain. No. This is their conspiracy. I haven't betrayed Leader. Believe me. Morishima. I'm Kotaro Dan, Ittousha. I'm going underground to protect Leader. Next time, I'm going to kill you. Kanto men are scary. Is that so? You're going to kill me, like this? Sure, sure. I won't forget. I've filed it right here. I'm Akira Sawai, Girestusha. I'm Imaizumi. I have something important to tell Mr. Yamaoka. Could you let me see him? I'm sorry, but he isn't seeing anyone. You can tell me. I see. So I can't see him?! Then please tell him this. Akira Sawai of Giretsusha had forgotten the the Yamaoka clan's iron rule that once you betray him, you will not be forgiven no matter how you atone for it. But you didn't have to do that to my wife. Although we are his disciples, not all of us are strong. When I was young... because I wanted to eat a bowl of curry rice, I was persuaded to man the propaganda truck and strayed into this path. Sir. I'm no good. I don't know what to say to my wife when I see her on the other side. So I wanted just one word, one word from Leader. Mr. Imaizumi. Please kill me before I leave this house. Otherwise, I won't be able to control myself. Please. Don't contaminate the sacred temple of our nation. Don't contaminate the sacred temple of our nation. No to his testimony in the Diet. No to his testimony in the Diet. To protect his name and interest, power hungry Yamaoka is trying to sell out our representative, former prime minister Hirayama. Dear? Are you determined to appear in the Diet? Why are you going out of your way? There's no value in taking on a world that has gone mad. Leader. Kaifu Mitamura of Jinkokai is here. Show him in. Yamaoka. Take a look at this. Commit Suicide I refuse. Yamaoka. Please die here like a man. I won't let you die alone. I'll go with you. Get Ikko. Bring him here. Don't you care what happens to the patriot movement in Japan? The only thing you can do for the country is to commit suicide. Showyour pure true spirit to your young followers. Can't you hear the angry voices of the citizens? Listen to them. They're your kind. Don't contaminate the sacred temple of our nation. Don't contaminate the sacred temple of our nation. I will continue to fight until Japan and the Japanese people are free from the fear of oppression from the wicked privileged class and their ultra-left revolutionary ideals. Are you going to fight against a hundred million people? Are you saying those voices are theirs? No. The hundred million are wrong. True, I've exposed myself to ridicule. I once regretted not committing suicide at the end of the war. I've brought him. Mitamura. This young man came to kill me. At that moment, I had a heart attack. He could have killed me easily then, but Ikko didn't kill me. I felt the hand of God then. Japan still needs me. That's an ugly self-delusion. You've been blinded by your lust for power. It's God's will. I lose. You're past worrying about life or death. But I don't understand. Why a man like you who's committed every evil act has achieved that state of mind. Are you a monster? Uekusa. Yoshimura. Tanabe. Kenmochi. Suga. Chiba. Takaoka. Urakawa. You'll go out into the world tomorrow to put into practice what I have taught you. I believe you've learned the basics in the last two years. From now on, you have to find your own destiny. No matter where you are, don't forget that my spirit runs through you in your blood. Ikko. You're still immature. I want you to concentrate on your studies with the new students who will be arriving. Just like you, I will go where the public will judge me. Since you are all my sons, I'll tell you why I'm appearing in the Diet. I'll probably have to confront former prime minister Hirayama. As you know, Hirayama was a prime minister that I created. But he betrayed me. He is now a menace to the country. One word from me and it would be easy to consign him to oblivion. However even if they tear me apart, I won't say a word. I'm going there to let the world know that remaining silent is my way of doing battle. Is Leader really all right? Of course he isn't. But what can we say? Leader is in a place we can reach. What's the schedule tomorrow? We'll have his car go out the front gate at 8 a.m., to draw the press and onlookers. At the same time, Leaderwill leave from the back gate. There's a danger of him being attacked en route, so we also have an alternate route. There's nothing more we can do. If something happens, we'll die with him. Why aren't you with the others? Because you alone were told to remain? It can't be helped. You're his favorite. What do your parents do? What did you do before you came here? Get out. What happened to your leg? Car accident? A fight? Or were you born like this? Poor thing. You must have had a really bad experience. Why did you try to kill Leader? I know. It's because of your leg. You think it was Leader's fault, that your precious leg was damaged. Aren't you going to try again? Is it because you've become weak? Weak little worm. Pick it up and toss it away. You're a man. If you intend to kill, use this. But killing me won't make the country better. Try to remember. About the day you came here. Who is the villain... All right? You got it? Orwill you kill me a woman? Ikko. Aren't you going to see Leader off? Mr. Imaizumi. Leader is leaving. Attention. Bow. No. To the Diet. Teacher. Teacher. I did receive money from Yamaoka. But I believed it was Yamaoka's political contribution pure and simple. That the leader of a country, even though a patriot, would change policy according to the will of a Yamaoka and to suggest that is to throw aspersions on the democratic principles... of Japan. Homei Yamaoka. - I cannot answer. - I don't like your attitude. Are you insulting the Diet? - Quiet! - Answer! Why did you come then? Quiet. Chairman! People. We just received urgent news. Former prime minister Hirayama was arrested on suspicion of bribery. Hirayama tried to sacrifice Homei Yamaoka to deny his guilt, but the god of justice exposed his deception and brought the sky down on him. Traitor Hirayama, beg forgiveness. Abolish Hirayama's corrupt politics of financial influence. Former prime minister Hirayama is the victim of factional infighting. What politician can say he is less guilty than Hirayama? The reason farmers are where we are today is all due to Mr. Hirayama. Let's believe in Hirayama and fight till the very end. Hang in there. We're behind you. Mr. Hirayama. Banzai. Banzai. Thank you. Ambulance. Call the ambulance. Kill him. Let's do it. Revenge for Mr. Hirayama. Kill him. Mr. Hirayama! Kill him. Avenge Mr. Hirayama. Die! For the country... THE END
