- I'm not finding any clues. - Oh, jeez! You scared me. God. - Okay, you go that way. - It's gotta be through here. - Oh, I got something. Yes. "There's only one way to go. "It's through the cubbyhole, but you'll need today's digits." - Today's digits. - The date today. - There's a keypad. Good one, ange. - All right, go for it. - Here we go. All right. - Oh, be careful. - It's a closet. There's gotta be a way to... It's a fake wall. - Oh. "You're almost safe. "The emeralds will be your salvation, but it will require teamwork." Emeralds. Where do we go from here? - Try touching the emerald-colored ones? - Maybe we hold them at the same time? - Okay. - We got it open. - Yay! - Wow. What do you think these are for? - I don't know. Assuming we'll find out. - We need a key. - Okay. - Maybe the totems have something to do with it? This one doesn't move. Maybe it's a lever. Oh, hey. Where's it going? - We're running out of time. - Ooh! - Whoa. - Oh, look, look, look. - Oh, hey. - Nice. - Let's hope this works. - Here's the exit. - We escaped! - Oh, my god, you did so good. - I did good? You were the one who cracked those codes. - Here you go. - Thank you. - We make a good team. - That we do. - Now if only a certain someone could set a date. - I'm trying, but it is really hard planning a wedding. - You're a wedding planner. That's what you do. - I know. I know. - Come on, woman, making an honest man out of me already. - It's a lot harder when it's your own wedding. There's so many options, so many ideas. And of course, it has to be perfect. - Well, I'm glad to hear you're keeping your expectations so reasonable. - One sec. - This message is for Angela Porter. I'm with the county sheriff's office. I'm calling in regards to your parents. - What is it? - Please call us back at 555-4344. - Mom and dad. - I'm so sorry for your loss. - Thank you. - Hey, ange. I'm so sorry. - Michael? Oh, my god, he actually came. - So that's your brother, huh? - Your brother? I didn't know you had a brother. - Well, I sorta didn't. He's been gone for years. No word, nothing. - Why? - I don't remember much about him, except he and my parents used to butt heads a lot. I was just a kid, but right after high school, they had this big blowout fight and he ended up cutting them out of his life. - Oh. - I guess I was just collateral damage. Will you guys just go make sure everybody gets seated and everything? - Of course. - Of course, yeah. - Okay. - Come on. - Hey, Angie. - I wasn't sure you'd come - it's... it's okay, right? - Of course. - I'm sorry, I-I meant to call and... - you know, everything's getting started, so we should probably just... - right. This is my fiancée, Olivia. - I am so sorry to be meeting under these circumstances. - Yeah, thank you. Well, I should... okay. - I feel bad for him. - For him? - Yeah, all that time he missed out on his parents, and now it's too late. - Yeah, it is too late. - Angie, I know you're really upset right now. I can't even imagine, but go easy on him. People do deserve second chances. - Hi. Michael. This is my fiancée, Olivia. - Hi. - Levi, Angie's fiancé. - Mia, Angie's best friend/employee. - Slash beautiful dress designer. - Stop. - Angie, I was hoping maybe you could come over to the house sometime so we could talk. We live about 20 minutes away. - You've lived 20 minutes away this whole time? - I'd just really like to talk. Here's my card. Not that you need it. The numbers are pretty easy. The last four digits are sevens. - Super easy. - Well, we should get going. - Okay, bye. - Let's get on home. - Okay, so these are some of our more classic designs, and we've also worked with some more fresh and modern color palettes, but everything's customizable. - Well, I want something more unique, but I'm afraid it might just come off weird. - Okay, first of all, do not worry about anything being weird or nontraditional. It's your wedding. Some of the best weddings I've worked on have included ideas I never would have thought of, but they came out absolutely spectacular. So you do you. Can I get you some coffee while you look through the book? - Sure. Thanks. - Okay. - Hey, ange, are you sure you're okay to be back at work? - Honestly, Mia, I think being at work is the only thing that's getting me through this right now. But it's a half-day. I'm seeing Michael later. - Mm. Nervous? - About seeing my brother after a decade of radio silence? Yeah, just a bit. - I'm sure it'll be fine. - That's looking really great. - Thank you. Oh. Mm-hmm, just gonna pin that right there. - All right, here we go. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Oh, you look so cute. - Thanks. - Come on in. - Oh, okay. - Yes, please. Welcome to our home. - Yeah, welcome. So this is the place. - Wow. - I can't believe you haven't been here before. champagne? - Oh, sure. Wow, this place is huge and so beautiful. You must do well for yourself. - I do all right. - And what do you do? - I'm a venture capitalist. - Oh, cool. - You don't know what that is, do you? No. - I live with the man, and I don't understand what he does. - Basically, I'm a private equity investor who provides capital to businesses who exhibit success or the potential for success in exchange for a cut of the profits. Right now, I'm working with a company that makes self-driving cars. - Sounds cool, but risky. - It is, but as you can see, it's well worth it. - Yeah, I can't wait till mom and dad can see... Sorry. I am... Still forgetting that they're not here. - Olivia, we're here. - Yeah. - Oh. We're in the kitchen. Hi, girls. Girls, this is Angie. Angie, these are my bridesmaids, Brenda, Dani, and Morgan. - Hi. - It's so nice to finally meet you. - We're so sorry for your loss. - Thank you. Morgan, Dani, Brittany? - Brenda. - Oh, sorry. - I'm Olivia's matron of honor. I introduced her to Michael. He's my husband's business partner. Michael and Olivia met at our wedding, actually. - Oh, - well, while they do wedding planning stuff, why don't we check out the patio? - Sure. - Hi, girls. So glad you guys are here. Bubbly is this way. - How are holding up? - Not good. How about you? - I'm... I'm okay. I can't tell you how many times I thought about calling mom and dad. - Why didn't you? - At first, it was pride. Truth be told, it was shame. I was never a good son. Obviously not a good brother. Never reconciling with them before they... That's my deepest regret. I don't think I'll ever forgive myself. I should have... And seeing you again, I know I can't make the same mistake with you that I did with them. I'm embarrassed, Angie. I feel so guilty. - It's okay. I'm glad you're back, and I know mom and dad would be too. Sorry. Guess it was just all built up. - Don't apologize. - After the funeral, I drove by that ice cream shop that I used to take you to all the time. Do you remember? You know, I used to take you after dance lessons. It was our little secret. Mom and dad used to wonder why you were so hyper after dance class. You drove 'em crazy those nights. You don't remember that? - No. But now I know why they pulled me out of dance class. - I didn't think about that. I hope that's not the reason. - I don't care. I hated a dance class, so thank you. - Hey, what are big brothers for? - Screw the new medication. Let the old fart croak. Howard is probably worth more dead than alive now anyways. - Same thing could be said about Michael. - Okay, I was just joking. You don't need to get all pissy. - Oh, a catfight and my name's mentioned? This cannot be good. - Don't worry, babe, I think we have better things to do than catfight over you. - Oh, poor Michael. I'd catfight over you. - Thank you, Morgan. - Mm-hmm. - Well, it appears that divorce makes even the prettiest girls desperate. Oh. Oh, you need a refill. - Oh, trust me, I'd love to, but I've got to get back to work. - Oh, what a shame. - What do you do, Angie? - I'm a wedding planner and I run a bridesmaid store. It was originally my mom's. Our mom, Bella. Fun fact, I've been nominated for best wedding planner in the state, every year actually. No wins yet, but maybe this one. - Oh, cute. - You know, I've got an idea. Why don't you plan mine and Olivia's wedding? - Are you sure? - Sure, I'm sure. - Olivia, do you mind? - No, no, of course not. - Okay, we'll call it a wedding gift. - Oh, no, we'll pay. I was gonna pay someone anyways. It might as well be my little sister. - Fine. Then I insist you accept a family discount. You can come by my store on Wednesday. Does 3:00 work? - Mm-hmm. - Okay. - I'll walk you out. - Sure. - congrats on the new wedding planner. - Shut up, Morgan. - I'm sure she'll be fine. - Why did you do that? - What? - Have her plan my wedding. It's my wedding. I should be the one to choose who plans it. - You said it was okay. - Because she was standing right there. What was I supposed to do? - She's family. I have to make everything okay with her. All right? Besides, I've yet to see you once not get your way. - Before we head out, could I grab those pills? - Yeah. Yeah. - Well, I think it will be fun having her plan the wedding. I hope Olivia takes us along. - I wanna see her face when Angie suggests guests drink out of Mason jars and sit on hay bales. - I can hear you guys, and you're not funny, - yes, I am. - Morgan. - Oh, my gosh, I was just joking. You know how I love to poke the bear. - oh, thank you. And you're sure these are safe for Howard? - Oh, absolutely. Our friend's dad in Canada has a heart thing too, and he takes them. I don't know why the FDA is being so weird. She says he's like a new man. Doesn't she, Michael? - Yeah, he's even hiking again. - Really? Wow. Well, I better head out. Bye, girls. - Bye. - Seriously, Olivia, thank you. - Of course. What are your friends for? - Come on, what is all this? Good news? Bad news? Are you feeling guilty about something? It's guilt, isn't it? - Can't a guy just spoil his woman by making her dinner? - No. So tell me, who is she? If I was going to cheat on you, it'd be with your brother, judging how you describe that house. - Oh, my god, it was insane. - But it went well? - Yeah, I mean, they asked me to plan their wedding, so I guess. - Sounds like a successful reunion to me. You didn't hear the news today, did you? - No. Why? Something crazy happen? - Oh, something a little crazy. Oh, my god, I won? Yeah. - Oh, with everything going on, I forgot today was... That's why you did all this. - To Angie's perfect weddings. The best wedding planner in the state. Mom and dad wanted this for years. That just... Just doesn't seem fair. - I know, ange. - Yeah. But this looks great, so... - ♪ Where my girls at? ♪ - ooh, I like this one. - Oh, that's one of Mia's designs. - Oh, Mia, bravo. - Thanks, girl. Okay, we also have this one. - Ooh, a Gatsby wedding. - Oh, yeah, you should do that. I love themed weddings. - She was being sarcastic, honey. - Oh. - Okay, I don't want some preplanned decoration scheme. - Okay. - Of course not. Yeah, this is just to get the creative juices flowing. We'll figure out what you want, and more importantly, what you don't want. - Great. - Elegant and classic. Mostly white with dusty Rose accents. I'll draw up some sketches of my own for you. Okay. - Okay, have you thought about a caterer? Well, Fleur de Paris would be okay, but they're booked out for months... - I'll give them a call. - I already tried that. - Simone, it's Angie. Are you available September 16th to cater a wedding? - All booked, huh? Merci. Got it. Also, I went to the Liberty yesterday of booking the grand garland. It's the best venue within a 200-mile radius, but I can cancel if you had other... - no, no, no. No. The grand garland is perfect. It's exactly what I wanted. - Well, she wasn't voted the number one wedding planner for nothing. - Oh, so you did win! - Well, we will have to celebrate. Happy hour at Jones assembly, ladies? - Oh, that'd be great. - Well, come on. - Oh, you mean now? - Mm-hmm. - Oh, I can't. I've got to work and... - I can handle everything here for the rest of the day. You go and have fun. - Are you sure? - Yes. You've earned it. Go. - Okay, if you're sure. - I am. Have fun, ladies. - Our favorite place is just around the corner. - Okay. - So how have been doing? I mean, losing both parents. - Oh, my god, Brenda, way to be a buzzkill. - Well, I wish that more people would have checked in on me after my dad passed. I was an absolute wreck. - Oh, I know. You married an old man. - Oh, my god, Howard is not old. He's not even 60 yet. - Old. - Daddy issues. - Shut up. - I'm just joking. - I'm hanging in there. Staying busy helps. - What about the will? I mean, assuming there was a will. - I know they had one, but I still need to find it. Things have just been so crazy lately, but... yeah, no, I should get on that. - Probably should. It's kind of important. - Okay, so what does this award-winning wedding planner have in mind for her own special day? - I have no idea. - Really? I would have thought that you'd have it all planned out by now. I had my wedding planned when I was nine. - Aw. - 18 years later. - Well, what can I say? I have standards. - As you should. I mean, that's why I got divorced. On to bigger and better things. - So what does your fiancé do? - He's an accountant. Oh, my god. No. No, no, no, okay? As your future sister-in-law, I'm going to have to intervene. You need to let Michael and I introduce you to someone a bit more... Lucrative. That's okay. I'm good. I'm very much in love with Levi. - I'm sure you are, but it's just as easy to fall in love with a rich man as a poor man, so might as well make it a rich one. Oh, my god, I'm kidding. - Oh. - No, she's not. - I swear, you guys have zero sense of humor. Hi. Could I have a refill? Just, like, all the way up this time. Thank you. - How'd the wedding planning go? Me and the girls took Angie to happy hour. As you requested, I am getting to know her. - Well, she is my sister. I'd hope you'd like to get to know her. - Mm-hmm. I asked her about the will. She says she's been too busy. - Olivia, really? - They were your parents too. You are just as entitled to half that estate as she is. You don't think she's playing dumb and trying to cheat you, do you? - Angie wouldn't do that. - Mm. She better not. Nobody messes with my man. - I'm home. Howard? Hey, listen, there's this new restaurant over on Lexington that I was thinking we should try. Howard? You okay? Howard, is that you? Howard? - Howard! Oh, my god! Howard! Oh, no. No, no, no, no. We need an ambulance. I think my husband's having a heart attack. Please, please, hurry. You're okay. You're okay. No, no, no. - no. - I know. Thank you. - Brenda, I'm so sorry. - Ah, thank you, Angie. You're so sweet to come. Thank you. - He was more than a business partner to me. He was my best friend. A brother, really. I'm gonna miss him. - Thank you, Michael. You have no idea what your friendship meant to us. You know, anyone else would have abandoned Howard after everything that happened, but you stayed. - If there's anything you need, please just... - there isn't. - Well... - Can we talk? Sorry. Nerves I don't handle death stuff too well. Who does? So I'm not sure how to proceed with this wedding. We should probably postpone planning. Don't you think? Like, a week maybe? That should be enough time for Brenda, right? - I really don't... I have no idea. I don't-i don't really know Brenda, so maybe you can talk to Dani and Morgan and see what they think. - Yeah. Oh, did you ever find that will? - Not yet. I'm just having a bit of trouble bringing myself to go to the house. It's just too many memories. - I understand. Lawyers always keep a copy, though, so you could try calling them. - I don't know who their lawyers are. - You're not in the loop at all, are you? Maybe marrying an accountant would a good thing for you after all. - Well, I told them to get their affairs in order years ago, and they did, so it's all in the house. - Oh, I know. I'm just teasing. But if you need anything, just let me know, okay? - these are some of our latest. I think they're absolutely gorgeous. - Anything you like, put over here. Nothing too poofy, though. Taking a week break was definitely the right thing to do so Brenda could get herself sorted, and I don't think it really slowed down the wedding planning that much, do you? - So is it Fiji or Tahiti you're doing the honeymoon at? - Tahiti. Fiji is where we wanted to do our wedding, but not everyone could afford it. - Not everything is about money, Olivia. I have to take this. - "Not everything is about money." Like that marriage was based on anything but money. - Well, I don't know. I actually think Brenda really loved Howard. - Oh, please, she's just mad that she has to go back down to Florida to find herself a new rich old man. - Olivia. - It's true. - What the hell was in those pills? - What? - I just got off the phone with the coroner's office and apparently, Howard didn't have any medication in his system. So what was in those pills? - What are you talking about? Those pills were fine. - Those pills were crap! They were nothing. They were fake! - That's impossible. Our friends are actually... - Howard's dead now because of you. He's dead. - Brenda... - Don't touch me. - Hey, okay. Come on, sweetie. Maybe we should... - no, I'm telling you, she-she... - shh, shh, we can talk about it in the car. - Brenda. - Not right now, Olivia. I'll handle it. - I better go help Morgan with Brenda. I'm sorry, Olivia. She's just not 100% right now. - Oh, wow. - what pills is she talking about? - Michael and I are friends with this girl and her husband who's the CEO of a pharmaceutical company in Canada. They have this new drug that really helped her dad with his heart, and I thought it'd be good for Howard too. The thing is, it's not legal in America yet. - Oh. - Do you think Michael and I could get in trouble? - Maybe it wasn't the pills. I mean, she said herself, there was no medication in his system, so maybe he wasn't taking them. - You're right. She did say that. I just cannot believe that Brenda would think that I'd actually... You know what? I think this really comes down to is that there's still some bad feelings. - About what? - Howard was Michael's business partner. They were very successful, but Howard got cocky, and... He did an investment without Michael's consent. It went south and they lost a lot of money. Things were bad between them for a while, but they finally patched things up. - That must be what Brenda was talking about at the wake. About how Michael... - Stuck it out with Howard. Yeah, against my advice. I mean, how can you trust someone after something like that? He basically stole from us. Anyway, Brenda was mad at me for a while because I didn't support the reconciliation between the two. I think Howard's death stirred up all of those feelings. - It's a tough time for her. Anger is one of the stages of grief anyway. I'm sure everything's gonna be fine. - I hope so. Here, it's the sketches of what I would like my wedding to look like. - wow, these are beautiful. You're quite the artist. - Thanks. So what are your plans for the rest of the day? - I am going to my parents' to see if I can get anything on that will. - Oh, well, how about I come along and help? - Oh, you don't have to do that. - It's the least I can do with everything you're doing for my wedding, and... And I'd really like to spend some time with my future sister-in-law. It's funny how people can be so organized, yet when it comes to something like a will or life insurance policy, no one wants to deal with it. - Well, it's kind of morbid. - True. Luckily, Michael is so logical about everything. There's no need to tiptoe. Like, I already have a life insurance policy on him, and we're not even married. He has one on me too. Yeah, I know it weirds everyone out, but Michael is so "cross the t's and dot the i's." I actually really like that about him. - I thought you didn't like stuff to do with death? - The concept of death I'm fine with. It's the aftermath. I guess that's why I'm just glad that Michael has everything taken care of. It makes me feel... Safe. - I guess I can see that. Having someone who's always prepared. Sometimes I wish I was a little more like that, but I don't like to think about the negative. Definitely a Rose-colored glasses kind of person. - So I've got nothing so far. - Okay. I'll check this desk. Do you mind getting that end table over there? - Mm-hmm. - Thank you. you're gonna kill me. It was on the desk. - Mm-hmm, yeah. And we tore through how many files? - I know, but who would think you'd put something so important right out in the open? Must've been going through it again or something. - Can I see it? - Um, sure. - Okay. - Everything okay? - No. No. No, it's not. You get everything. Michael gets nothing. - What? How could they do that to him? Why would they cut him out? - What am I gonna tell Michael? - Tell him... Nothing. He doesn't need to know. As far as I'm concerned, it's 50-50. - You would do that? - Of course. I couldn't do that to my own brother. Thank you. You're a good sister. - I have some wine bottles for you to sample from Fleur de Paris. - Ooh, bring them over tomorrow night. We can do a little sampling with Michael and the girls. - Sure. What time? So Michael... - Olivia, are you okay? Olivia? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. It's just a little anxiety attack. I get those sometimes. It's been a rough day, obviously. So tomorrow at 7:00 for wine sampling. That works, right? - Yup. Something's up with her. - Well, lots of people have anxiety attacks. - It's not that. Anxiety, I get. What I don't get is how she treats people. I mean, she can be nice, sometimes, but she can also be a selfish bully. I mean, her friend basically accused her of murder. Doesn't really speak to her character, you know? - Have you talked to Michael? - Not yet, but I'm going to. - Nope. Bad idea. You're just now back on speaking terms with him, and then you go bashing his fiancée? I'm a guy, and I can tell you that will not go over well. - You're probably right. I just have such a bad feeling. Ugh, I do not want to go there tomorrow. - Would it make you feel better if I came with you? - Oh! Angie and her accountant. - Hey. - Hey. - And what? - Hi, Angie. - Look, the money's on its way. - Right over here. - It's tied up. You know how that goes. It has to be released and transferred and... Look, I said I'll have it. I gotta go. Hey, sis. - Hey. - Levi. - Hey, man. - Everything okay? - Totally fine, though one can never rest easy when Olivia has your credit card. - Oh, please. So what kind of wine did you bring? Is Brenda not coming? - Oh, who knows? She hasn't been responding to any of my calls or texts, so... - Does the wine have sulfates? - God, what's going... - Olivia! Olivia! - Are you out of your mind? - Calcium. Those pills are just calcium. - What are you talking about? I already told you, the pills are fine. - That's crap. - We can call your friends right now and they'll tell you. - Brenda, I know you've been through a lot... - I had them tested. - What? - You're gonna pay for this. - Brenda! - What does she mean the pills are just calcium? - Who knows? She's insane. And out of the wedding, I might add. - Well, maybe your friend got confused and sent the wrong pills. - Of course not. He's the CEO of the number one pharma company in Canada. They don't make mistakes like that. - She probably went to see some quack who didn't know what he was talking about. You know how easily she falls for a scam. How do you think she ended up with Howard? - When people are upset, sometimes they just need someone to blame. - No. She is accusing Michael and I of murder, Angie. That's not something you just go, "oh, no big deal. All is well." Anyways, I am done talking about this. She already ruined my wedding dress shopping. She is not gonna ruin this. So which one should we open first? Because I could really use a drink. - Hey, hey, hey. - Hello. - Ooh, how was last night? - Like "real housewives" meets "investigation discovery." - Really? Sounds kind of awesome, actually. - No, it was not awesome. - Oh. - We were so freaked out when we got home, we googled her. - Mm. Did you find anything? - Yes. - Okay. - Apparently before Michael, she was the girlfriend to some rich old oil exec named Richard vardera. - Ah. - He died of a nasty fall down the stairs, but there was talk that she pushed him. - Didn't you say she had, like, a whole freak out thing at the top of some stairs the other day? - Mm-hmm. - Maybe she was having a flashback. - That's not all. Apparently he left her quite a bit in his will. The family contested it, even accused her of murder, but they couldn't prove anything, so she walked away with a lot of money. - Well, you have to tell Michael. He could be her next victim. - But I think Levi's right. Love can make you dumb. - Well... - If we want Michael to believe us, we are gonna need some serious ammo. - Like what? Brenda? - Is that smoke? Maybe check to see if the door is open. - Let's see. Oh, yeah, it's open. - What? What is that? The alarm? What is... - Oh, my god. - What is that smell? - Oof. Wow. Ooh! - Okay, Mia, be careful. Be careful. - I got it. I got it. Yes. - Brenda? Brenda, are you here? Brenda. All right. Let's check upstairs, I think? - Yeah. - All right, ladies, it looks like we got all the information we need from you today. - Do you have any leads? Because there's someone I think that you should talk to. - Leads? Nothing's official until the coroner's made his determination. But from what I've seen, this is looking like a suicide. - A suicide? She was in the middle of cooking. Nobody decides to kill themselves while roasting a chicken. - I can't imagine how you must be feeling right now, but rest assured we're following all the protocols. - Look, I'm telling you, something's not right. Her husband recently died, and she was accusing her friend of tampering with his pills. Now all of a sudden she's dead? - Sounds like a woman who's going through a lot. Look, the coroner's very thorough, okay? In the meantime, here's my card. - I have to talk to Michael. - Yeah. - Are you okay? Just got your messages. Oh, my god, Angie. - I'm okay. - I can't believe you had to see something like that. I'm so sorry. This world's going crazy. Are you sure you're okay? - I'm fine. But I worry you may not be. - It's definitely a shock. I never thought Brenda the type of person that'd kill herself. - I don't think that she did. - What do you mean? - Can you guys just give us a second? - Sure, babe. - Michael, I don't know how to tell you this, but I think Brenda was murdered. By Olivia. I've had a weird feeling about her for a while, but I didn't want to say anything. But then I googled her and found out about how she might've murdered this billionaire... - wait, wait, you think Olivia killed Brenda? - Yes, and maybe even Howard. I mean, that's what Brenda suspected with the pills. - Our friend didn't give us bad pills. - But what if she tampered with them? Think about it. All these deaths around her? Do you know who you're marrying? What if you're the next rich man she pushes down the stairs? - She didn't push him. He fell. - So you do know about that? - Yes, of course. She told me all about it. It was a very traumatic experience, so thanks for digging that back up. I'm sure she'll appreciate it. - Michael, why can't you see that Olivia... - what I see is that Olivia is the woman I wanna spend the rest of my life with, and if you can't accept that, then I don't want you planning my wedding. I don't even want you there. - Michael, please. - Look, and as far as I'm concerned, the will was the last piece of business we have with each other. - I just can't stop thinking. I can't believe she's gone. - She just never seemed the type. - I suppose you just never really know a person. - You girls okay? Olivia, I've got some bad news. You're gonna have to find a new wedding planner. - What? Why? - Can we just talk about this later? - No, let's talk about it now. - I fired Angie. - Without consulting me, you just up and... - Olivia, come on. - We are supposed to be a team. - Can we just talk about this later? - But you just told me... - she thinks you murdered Brenda. She thinks he did something to those pills. And she googled you, so I’m sure you know where that led. So yeah, I fired her. And I told her she's no longer welcome in our lives. - Wow. Just wow. I cannot believe this. - Olivia. Olivia, it's okay. None of us think you're a murderer. - Here. Looks like you need it. - So the pattersons are... - The pattinsons? - Pattinsons, sorry. - Mm-hmm. - Yes. My brain. They're coming in at 10:00 to finalize the, um... The thingamajiggy, the... - The reception? - Right, yes. Words, Angie, words. And then I'm gonna need you to hold down the fort while I meet with Michael and the lawyer today. - Ah, hence the stress. - Exactly. After that, we just have a couple... Olivia. - I want my sketches. How much? - Nothing. - How much? - I don't want Michael's money. I think he has enough problems right now. - I have my own money, you know. - Richard vardera's money? - I don't know what I did to offend you or what you think you know about me... - I'm just trying to protect my brother. - Right, 'cause you guys are so close. The phone works both ways, you know? You could have called all those years. But I guess being the only child just works better for you. - No, no, it doesn't work better for me. Wow. You really think I'm a murderer, don't you? Good, 'cause then maybe you'll listen to me when I say that I will never let anything come between Michael and me. And if you know what's good for you, you'll stay far, far away from us. - Wow, that girl is crazy. - So the will you sent me didn't have any signatures on it, so it doesn't override the older will I have on file. - Oh, I didn't know there was another will. Okay. What does that say? - It's a very standard will. Unlike the one you submitted, everything is split 50-50, including the business. - Wait, what? Was I cut out of the will? - I talked to Olivia. I told her I would split everything 50-50 anyway. Sorry, I meant to tell you not to say anything. - Unbelievable. - I'm sorry, do you two need to... - no, go on. - Basically, all there is left to do is wait for the insurance company to payout. - And how long will that be? - Easily within the month. - Good, as far as the business goes, I'd like a report of its earnings. See if it's something I want to pursue. Otherwise, I'll be selling my half. - I'm sure you can arrange that. - Yes, but I don't know if I have the funds to pay out your half outright. I might need some time. - If you don't have the funds, I'm sure someone else will. - Michael, it's a family business. - Anything else? - No. - All right, then. Yeah, talk to me. - How does something double in price overnight? Yeah. I mean, yes. I'm glad things are going well with your company, but I don't have that kind of money right now. Okay. Okay. - Everything all right? I could only get bits of the conversation, but it sounds like he's having money problems. What more can I do? I've tried calling. I've tried texting. I tried talking to him today, but he can barely look at me. - Maybe I can talk to him, you know, as someone on the outside looking in. - You're sweet, but trust me, you do not wanna get involved in this drama. - Okay, I have a confession to make. I'm not just being sweet when I offer to help. I'm just actually being plain nosy. It's so exciting! Million-dollar deals gone bad, tampered pills, a billionaire pushed down the stairs, and a killer gold-digging debutante out on the loose? Come on. - You're the worst, you know that? - Please let me get in on the chaos that is your life. It's so much more exciting than mine. - Okay, fine. - Yes, yes! Okay, what can I do? - Okay, I need you to play private investigator. - Okay. - Find me the contact info for Richard vardera's family. Maybe they can give me something, anything to make Michael see reason. - Okay, vardera family. Got it. - Olivia, I'm home. - Hi, baby. hey, how'd it go? - You knew I was cut out of the will? - I'm sorry. I should have told you. I just... i didn't want you to get hurt. And she said she'd split it. She did split it, didn't she? Tell me she split it. - It's okay. It's okay. That will ended up not being valid anyways. There's an older version, though, valid, 50-50. - Oh, so you have your money and we can do the investment deal. I think... - There's no deal. - It can't be over. - Olivia, it's over. I need more money, and it's done. - We're gonna get through this, I promise. Hey, hey, you still have me. - Yeah. Still have you. - And I always find a way. Always. - I'm so sorry I'm late. I got your calls, but I just cannot seem... - yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever. Look, I got you a meeting with the granddaughter. - What? - I looked into the family last night like you asked and created a potential list of contacts. I called most of the family, but majority of them hung up on me. But the granddaughter was super sympathetic to your situation and has decided to meet with you. Her name's Ashland. - Are you serious? - Mm-hmm. - Okay, when? - In an hour. - An hour? - Right off the bat, I just wanna thank you so much for meeting with me, especially under these weird circumstances. - Anything to keep it from happening again. - Hi. - Hi. - Your usual table for four? - Yes. I mean, no. - So you do think she's dangerous. - At first, no. I wouldn't say that I was crazy about her, but I had no idea what a dark side she had. - You knew her before your grandfather's death? - Yeah. Look, I know what it looks like, a man his age with a woman Olivia's age. You're thinking he's some creepy old guy, but he wasn't like that. Grandpa Richard was a good man. He was kind and so funny and just great. - Hi, this is Dani. I obviously can't answer the phone right now, so leave a... - hey, this is Morgan. I'm not here right now, so... - I mean, yeah, she was definitely with him because he was rich, but she made him happy, you know? - Yeah. - But then she started pressuring him to marry her. He was hoping that Olivia could just be happy with his time and being left in the will, but that wasn't good enough for her. Things were starting to get tense, and he told me he was thinking about breaking it off. She said he fell, but it just didn't ring true. And the way she was fighting for his money, it was disgusting. I think she pushed him. - She's engaged to my brother. I'm really worried about him. - You should be. - I've tried talking to him, but he won't listen. He won't even speak to me. I was thinking that maybe you could talk to him just because you know everything and... - Sweetie, I already did. - What? When? - About a year ago at some fundraiser. I pulled him aside and tried to warn him, but it was too late. He was already hooked. - There's nothing I can do, is there? - ange, how was it? - Not good. She's already tried talking to him before. It's hopeless. - Like I said, I can go and... - No. Stay out of it. If me, Ashland, and a trail of dead bodies can't convince him, nothing can. - Hello? Hello? The door was open. Hmm. Wow. Oh. Hey, Mia, what's up? - You're not gonna believe this. I'm in their house. - Who's house? - Michael and Olivia's. - What? Mia, I told you to back off. You can't just go breaking into someone's house. Are you crazy? - The door was open, so I walked in. - You walked in? No, Mia, get out of there. Come on. - Wait, shh, shh, shh. - Mia, you need to get out of there. Mia? Mia? - What's wrong? - What's happening? Mia? - Oh, my god. What's happening? Mia? Oh, my god. Oh, my god. - What happened? - We have to go. - I did not make this phone call. I have been out. - This is your home? - Yes. - We are responding to a 911 call that someone was in... - Okay, I didn't... what? - Is Mia here? - I need you two to stop right there. - Oh, thank god. Michael! - What's going on? - All right, everyone calm down and just explain to me what happened. - My friend Mia was in their house. - What? - Wait, why was she in our house? - She came here to talk to you about Olivia. - She broke into our home? What? - Ma'am, is this true? - Look, all I know is, she was attacked in the house. Can you please go inside and look for her? - You two mind if we go take a look around? - Are you serious? - Sure, take a look. But if you find her, arrest her for breaking and entering. - We've got consent to search. So nothing looks disturbed to you? - Nope. - But I heard her being attacked. - Ma'am I don't know what to tell you. It sounds to me like your friend shouldn't have been here in the first place, and she's clearly not here now. If you do find anything else later, something moved, something missing just let us know. - Absolutely. - Oh, and before you go, I want a restraining order against her and her little burglar friend. - You'll have to go to the courthouse for that. - Oh trust me, I will. Now, could you please escort them off our property? - Come on, Angie. - Michael, please, I know that... - Come on, let's go. - Okay. All right. Please, please, please, please, please answer. - Hey, hey, hey, it's Mia. Sorry I missed your call, but you know what to do. - Oh, honey. Come here. - This is all my fault. - Babe, it's not your fault. - Yes, it is. - No, it's not. It's Olivia's fault and she will not get away with it. Okay? She won't. - Hey, hey, hey, it's Mia. Sorry I missed your call, but you know... - 911. What's your emergency? - Hi, I need to report a missing person. - Maybe you should take today off? - I'm okay. - Do you want me to take the day off and stay here with you? - I told you I'm fine. It's Mia we should be worrying about. - But you've done all you can. - Which isn't much. I mean, I filed a missing persons report, but I kind of got the impression they weren't taking me very seriously. - She's missing. How could they not take that seriously? - I don't know. They said adults can go missing if they want, and it's only been a day, and was I sure I wanted to file? I don't know, it just kind of seems like everyone I'm turning to for help is just tuning me out. Except you, of course. - I just wish there was something more I could do. Maybe if I file a report on her too, it might urge them along. - Breaking news, the body of a woman was discovered early this morning in an alleyway downtown. Police suspect foul play, though they have not released any more details as of yet. - Mia. - We'll keep you informed... I know you. - You told me to come back if I had any more information. - That's right. The suicide? - It wasn't a suicide. - Okay. What brings you in? - I think I can identify the woman who was found this morning. - We've already identified her. - Was it Mia tishner? - I'm sorry. - Oh, no. Olivia. That's the woman who did this. - Olivia. You think Olivia is the one that killed Brenda? - Yes, and Howard, and her ex, Richard. - Okay. Okay, slow down. - Okay. I was on the phone with Mia when she was looking into Olivia. - When she was breaking and entering. - The door was open. - During my investigation, I also found that a restraining order was taken out on you and Mia. Now, look, I don't know what's going on with you all... - I'm trying to tell you. - And I'm gonna listen, but in the meantime, while you're here giving me a statement, I'd appreciate it if I could collect a DNA sample from you. - What? She's not... - I need to investigate this from all angles, and that starts with eliminating suspects. Will you cooperate? - Yes, but please, get Olivia's DNA too. - Anything you wanna watch? Are you okay? - Dani and Morgan aren't talking to me. - Why? - Because of Angie, of course. Ever since you said she basically accused me of murder, they've been ghosting me. And then... - What? What is it? - I saw Angie at Jones assembly... Talking to Ashland, Richard's granddaughter. So now I have two people who think I'm a murderer conspiring against me. So yeah, I'm a little tense. - Why didn't you tell me? - 'Cause you're stressed enough as it is. I didn't wanna add to it. - Do you want me to talk to Angie? - Mm-hmm. - wanna grab a movie tonight? Get your mind off things? - Can't. I have to go to mom and dad's and make sure all their paperwork and bills are in order. The lawyer told me I have to put together a financial report for Michael. - Want me to stay with you? - You're sweet, but I don't think I'd be good company. I don't care. I just want you safe. - Olivia would be an idiot to try anything. - why are you guys ignoring me? And what was up with lunch? You girls know how humiliating it is to just be sitting there all alone. I mean, we just lost Brenda, Angie is basically ruining my life, and then you guys just decide to go Mia on me. You wanna know what I got to do last night? Hmm? I got DNA swabbed by a detective for the murder of that Mia girl. Mm-hmm. I mean, do you believe we're suspects? She broke into our house. It doesn't make any sense. Yeah, you guys missed out on some real melodrama. why are you guys just standing there all weird? What is going on? Olivia, we want you to leave. - What? - You need to go. - You think I killed them. - yes? - Hi, Michael. Is Olivia tilden here? - She's not. What do you need? - I've got a warrant for her arrest. - I just can't believe that you think I'd really do something like that. - With all these deaths, what do you expect us to think? - What do I expect you to think? Now's really not a good time. - The cops came here to arrest you. - What? Why? - For Mia's murder. Olivia, what's going on? - I-I-I don't know. I don't know. - I told them where you were. - You did what?! - What else was I supposed to do? Olivia, please tell me you didn't do this. - Please, Michael, please, you know me. Just tell me you believe me. - Look, everything's gonna be all right. We'll get through this. - The cops are coming. You gotta hide me. - Hide you? You just got done telling us how innocent you are. - Yeah. - Morgan, please, you gotta help me. - You want me to help you, and you're a suspect in a murder case? - Just stall them or something. What the... oh, my god. - Police, open up. - I will not forget this, Morgan. - okay, well, I'll see you in a couple weeks then. - Thank you so much, Angie. - Of course. Michael. - Angie, I screwed up. The cops came to arrest Olivia today. - Oh, my god. - We don't know where she is. I don't know what to do. Can I see you later tonight? Someplace safe like mom and dad's? - Sure. I was just heading there now. - Oh, god, this is such a mess. - Hey, everything's gonna be okay. I'll see you soon. - Oh. One sec. I'm upstairs. I'm so glad you... - You! - What are you doing here? - You ruined my life! - Get away from me! - I wanna kill you! Let me in! - You took everything from me! My friends, my Michael, my freedom, everything! - Angie. Angie. Are you all right? - I'm okay. I'm okay. Michael saved me. - And Olivia? - What was I supposed to do? - That's exactly what I'm trying to figure out here, Michael. - Oh, hold on. What's going on? - Just routine questioning. Maybe this would be better if we took this down to the station. - At the station? What's to question? - He thinks... He thinks I shouldn't have stubbed Olivia. - That's not what I said. Just questioning whether or not he could have handled this in a different way. - Excuse me, detective, my brother saved my life, which is a lot more than I can say for you. - Ma'am... - no, he's not going to the station. We've been through enough as it is. Come on, Michael, let's get you home. - He's right, though. I could have handled it differently. - No, don't that. Don't torture yourself with should'ves and could'ves. You panicked. You were scared. You didn't know it would kill her. You just wanted her to stop. Come here. - You okay? - Yeah. Sorry, bad dream. - Olivia? - Sorta. - Wanna talk about it? - No. - I told her to talk to someone about it months ago. - Yeah, it's not a bad idea. Therapy is very in right now. All the cool kids are doing it. - It's okay. Probably just wedding jitters. This was supposed to be your wedding. - I told you not to think about it like that. - Besides, we can't let the perfect wedding planned by the best wedding planner in town go to waste, can we? - so things are going well? - Yeah. The deal went through. Already starting to see profits. In fact, I'm about to close on another deal. Just doesn't seem right to feel happy about it. - Why? - I mean, it was Olivia's insurance policy that made it possible. - And things with Morgan? So far, so good. I know it's a little weird. - Getting together with your murderous fiancée's bridesmaid? Happens all the time. - Well, seriously, if you're happy and she's treating you well, that's all that matters to me. - I'm starting to lose the sun. I think I'm gonna head in. - Yeah, I should probably get on home. - You're leaving? - She's kicking me out tonight. Apparently, it's bad luck for me to see her tomorrow before the wedding. I miss them so much. I wish they could be there tomorrow. I can't imagine my wedding without them. You know? Like, in all my little girl wedding fantasies, they were there. Mom crying, dad walking me down the aisle. It's just not fair. - I'll walk you down the aisle. If you want, that is. Is that a yes? - Yes. Yes, that's a yes. - What did I miss? - Michael's gonna give me away tomorrow. To who? Oh, shut up. - I love you. See you tomorrow. - Love you. - You still up for that movie? I'll make popcorn. - Sure. Yeah, let me change. - Can you believe they still use those things? - I know, right? It feels crazy knowing this won't be my house anymore. - You regret selling? - Needed to be done. Too many memories, you know? Get a fresh start. You go help Morgan before I start crying again. I'll be done soon. - Okay. - You've reached the porters. - We're not here right now, so... Leave a message. - You gotta push that button. - That one? - Yeah. - You've been Pre-selected to win a free trip to Hawaii. For more... - Hey, guys, just calling to check in. Love you. - Answer the phone. I know you're there. Answer the... - I told you, Michael, we can't help you. - Can't or won't? - Won't. - Why am I not surprised? - You don't get to cut us out of your lives and then come back asking for money. And the way you talked to your mother last night... - She deserves to feel... - That's enough! Don't ever call here again. Please, just stay away. You'll pay for this. Sorry you had to hear that. - What was that? You said you haven't talked to them in years. - I know, Angie. I... - they sounded terrified of you. - I know, and I'm so sorry. If I could take it back, I would. I was desperate and angry. That's why I tried to get back in your life after it happened. I felt terrible. And how that'd be the last conversation I had with them just... Angie, please. I know what I did was wrong. That's why I kept it from you. Please, I don't wanna lose the only family I have left. I can't screw this up too. Angie. - how did Olivia know I was here? I've been running that night through my mind over and over, and I can't seem to figure out how she knew I was here. - Lucky guess, maybe she tried your apartment and office already and you were... Wait, why are you asking me this? - In my dreams, I see you standing over me with that letter opener. You raise it... - And? - I wake up. - Sounds scary. - It is. - It's just a dream. - Is it? - Maybe Levi's right. Maybe you should see someone. - Are you saying I'm crazy? - I'm saying you've been through a traumatic experience. A few of them, actually. I mean, think about it. Our parents died, then Brenda. I show up all of a sudden in your life with a psycho murderer for a fiancée. It's a lot to unpack. Hell, Morgan and I might join you in therapy. Maybe we can get a group rate. Please tell me we're okay. - Yeah. Yeah, we're okay. Guess I've just been through a lot. - Come on, Morgan's waiting. - Yeah, I'll be right down. I just have to answer a couple work emails first. - Man, and I thought I was a workaholic. - This is detective hasler. Leave me your name and your number. - Detective, this is Angie Porter from the Olivia tilden murders. I'm probably being crazy right now, and I can't even believe I'm calling you, but... could we talk soon? I just... It's about my brother, and... I'm probably just being paranoid. Call me. Oh, my god, I think I am going crazy. - Oh, Michael. Jeez, you scared me. - You just couldn't leave it alone, could you? - Leave what alone? - Oh, don't play. I heard you talking to that detective. So, sis, what's been on your mind? I know you have questions, theories. Ask. - You told Olivia where I was, didn't you? - No. Actually, what I told her was to meet me here. Seeing you here must've been quite the surprise for her. - Why? - I wanted to stage it like she killed you. - What? - I needed money. And with you out of the picture, I would inherit everything. - So my dream. - Wasn't a dream. - Why didn't you kill me? - When I walked in, she was choking you. - Then she stopped. And let's face it, one of you had to die so I could get my money. So I figured I'd kill Olivia for the insurance money and leave you alive to defend my actions like a good little sister, and you did just that. - Did Olivia do any of it? - No. I mean, maybe Richard, but the more I got to know her, the more I believed it was an accident. Regardless, if you ever need a fall guy, or girl in this case, it's nice to have a potential murderess around to take the blame. - Why would you do this? How could you do this? - Honestly, it wasn't supposed to get that far. If mom and dad had just given me the money, a lot of this would have never happened. - You killed them? - Cut their brakes. It was easy enough. Seemed like the quickest way. - You're gonna kill me. - I knew they were cutting me out of the will, if they hadn't already. - You get everything. Michael gets nothing. - So while I waited on my inheritance, I decided to deal with Howard. He went behind my back and cut me out of everything. - No! Oh, my god. - So I got rid of him, which made the company all mine, and let's face it, it felt really good to give Howard exactly what he deserved. - Olivia! - Unfortunately, Brenda was smarter than I gave her credit for. She found out about the pills and I couldn't have it traced back to me, so I killed her. Then you and your little friend just couldn't leave things alone. You had to stick your nose where it didn't... - no, no, no, no! No! Morgan! - Oh, my god. - Morgan. - Oh, my god, Michael, are you okay? - Morgan, call 911. It's him. It's been him the whole time. - You've ruined everything. - No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. please stop. - Michael and I have worked too hard for you to come along and screw this all up. Do you hear me? - Don't make me! - No, you don't have it in you. Besides, you brought this on yourself, just like Mia did. I didn't want to. - Shh. - What's happening? Mia. - Brenda, Mia, I didn't. But we didn't have a choice, and I don't have a choice now. - You're just as bad as him! - You! - This ends now. - crazy, huh? - Crazy. - Oh, thanks. They're ready. Let's do it. - may I have the paperwork for the marriage? I'm surprised you're doing a courthouse wedding. I hear you're a wedding planner. You don't want a big, beautiful wedding of your own? - We decided to go full-on honeymoon. - London. - Then Paris. - Vienna. - Florence and Rome. - Followed by a tour of the Greek isles. - Then the rest I think we'll just wing it. - Wow, with a honeymoon like that, who needs a wedding? - Exactly. Who needs a wedding? - ♪ Don't ♪
