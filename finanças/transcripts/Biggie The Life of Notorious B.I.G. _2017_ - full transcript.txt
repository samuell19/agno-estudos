I had a river of tears coming down. I digested the art of the music. I heard him telling a story. And it took a talented human being to do this. I said, "My God, if he wrote this, that was a brilliant man." And I think from then on, when it comes to the rap music, I try very hard not to judge it, but to look at the human being behind it.
