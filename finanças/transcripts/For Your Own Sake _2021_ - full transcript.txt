The family only has the one car, you think it'll be ready? - Yes, sir. - Great. I've got some paperwork to do and I'll lock up after. - All right. Have a good weekend, Doug. - You too. Gotta stay out of jail.

(radio playing music) - Okay. - [Attendant] Hey, Doug, how's the shop going? - Good, business is good. - [Attendant] Excellent.

At the bottom of the canyon. - Okay. Just get home safe. - How was the drive? - Quick. I don't know. The freeways were wide open. I got here at like four. - Told you, Phoenix isn't that far. - I got lucky with traffic. - I'm lucky. All my girls around the table again. - Well, I'm glad to be home, but it's really not safe to talk and drive so I'm gonna let you- - I've been driving and talking since cell phones were invented so I'm in no danger, sweetie. - Tells me. I'll let you go, okay? - See you soon. Goodbye. - Bye. (clock ticking) (crickets chirping) - No, no, then what was the point of all this? - It's important you not feel trapped. - If he wants to go, we have to let him. - Dad's almost here. - Thank you for calling him. (crickets chirping) (car engine roaring) (Doug humphing) - Fay, it's very rare for someone to walk away from this. Look, when Doug sees us together and knows we mean business, he'll sink in. When my wife and dad confronted me at my intervention and had to look him in the eyes, trust me, Doug will hear us out. - Dad wasn't in your intervention? (liquid gurgling) (crickets chirping) (crickets chirping continues) - Lester, how many people have walked out of cases you've been a part of? - Only a handful over my nine years of working. If we express our support and love, everything will fall into place. Let's not focus on what might happen. Let's focus on being in the moment for your father. (door creaking) - Hi, dad. - I take it dinner is going to be later then. Keith, how's it going. - Beautifully. - Good to know. I'm guessing you're after my daughter. (laughing) - My name's Lester Baron. I'm an interventionist. - That's worse. (Chloe laughing) - We're willing to have a meeting. Living room okay for you, Doug? - How much do you charge an hour? - Really? - It's not important. - Doug, you're gonna hear us out? - I'm the one being blindsided, how am I the bad guy? - No one's the bad guy or the good guy. We're here to talk. Have a simple discussion. - In that case, I'm gonna need a drink of water. - I'll get it. You guys go sit down, I'll get it. (door creaking) (water gurgling) (gentle soothing music) (footsteps pattering) - Whenever you're ready. - You are the love of my life, my best friend, and the father of our beautiful children. You are the strongest person I know, except when it comes to this. I have tolerated your drinking because of the strength and openness you show in everything else, but no longer. This flaw, which I have learned is better described as a disorder, has been with you for most of your life. 13, Doug, you were a child when you had your first drink. There is not a time, day or night, when you don't have the flask on you. It's always been escalating slowly and I have mistaken that as being in control of it. Your drinking is to the detriment of your health and our relationship. Accidents I have had to deal with, stumbling doing your hard work, falling off the couch and cutting your head. Drunkenly punching your hand against the wall. You've always been a homebody, but you and that flask have all but completely retreated into your study. We all love you. You need help, Doug. Accept this opportunity please. - Keith. (paper rustling) - Doug, I've always admired you. Your ability to build things and see things to the end. This house, your business, this gorgeous family. Doug, God has blessed you with determination and you've done so much with that gift. Doug, I have such respect for you. The Lord's blessings also come with challenges that He asked us to overcome. Doug, we both struggle with being stubborn men. We think our way is the right way, but there's nothing right with having six drinks when we go out together. Doug, I'm asking you as a friend to keep an open mind and to listen to what your family and what God has to say to you. I know you'll make the right decision. - There's so much love in this room. Chloe, dear, your turn. - Well, mine's short. (paper rustling) Dad, I don't know what's normal or what's right, which are pretty subjective. When I see you crashing on the couch, flask nearby, I see the hardest working person I know relaxing in his own way. We grow up being asked to better ourselves every day. You're a far better person than I am, dad, but do you think the happiest and healthiest version of you drinks the way you do now? It's up to you. - You're the rock of this family, your friends, and your business. You overcome what life throws at you while bearing the troubles of those who need you. You are the definition of supportive in the way that you bring your intelligence, passion, and humor to others. You supported cooking stoves when no one else would. Chloe and I had an amazing childhood because of you and mom. You've always been there for us, please let us be there for you. When we talk on the phone, you try to hide the fact that you're slurring your words. You drink as a coping mechanism and it's hurting you and everyone close to you. We've all done learning and growing in preparing for this. And by participating, you've shown your willingness to grow and learn with us. (somber music) There's this great facility in Florida, it's called Coast Path Healing. - Florida? - The best for senior treatment is Coast Way. But I can email a fair list of great California facilities. - So what do you say? - Look, I appreciate all your concerns and I know this embarrassing ordeal came from a good place, but there's no way in hell I'm going to some facility. If my drinking really makes all of you that uncomfortable, I'll be more conscientious just going forward. I'll give you my word, that's the compromise I'm willing to make. - You are a highly functioning sufferer of AUD. You need professional help. - Professionals who know all the abbreviations. - Acronym. - AUD is an initialism. - Who cares? - Doug, please don't be combative. - I'm trying to meet you halfway here. - Dad, you have a problem. - We all have problems, why do you get to come into my house and tell me mine? - Doug, everyone is here for you, you need to do right by them. If you refuse treatment, there will be consequences. Each person has prepared one. - Oh, your last resort is to strong arm me? This I wanna hear. - No one's strong arming. - What's your consequence? - Dad. - Go on. - If you don't get help, I'll stop visiting the house. - Wow, four times a year to zero. Big deal. Keith, your consequence. - Take some time to think about it, Doug. And I'm sorry it's come to this. I know it's difficult for you. But until you make the right choice, I can't take part in the erosion of your life anymore. - The erosion of my life. At least I make an honest living, you snake. - Why do you have to make this so hard? - What's yours? - Doug, listen- - Oh, I'm listening. - Please. - Consequence now! - I'll file for a divorce. - Get the papers. I'll sign. You damn coward, Fay. - Enough! God, we get it, Dad, you're pissed. - Get the fuck out! All of you. This is my home too. Everyone stays. - Chloe, what was your consequence? - I didn't have one, Dad, it's your life. - Damn right. (gentle dramatic music) (crickets chirping) (gentle dramatic music continues) - Empty your pockets. (phone clattering) (Doug grunting) Back to the house real slow. - My truck and my cash are yours. I won't say a word and you will never hear- - I wish that was enough. The more difficult you make things for me, the more I make 'em for you. - I got a family. - We all do. - They're inside, please don't hurt them. - We'll come to that. Move. - Unbelievably selfish of you, Chloe. - I didn't wanna do this. - Stop it you two. - She just had to undermine all of us. - You always need someone else to blame. - Ladies, enough. - Emotions are running high. Breathe with me. (inhaling and exhaling) Doug left on his own. We did our best. - Ah, he's coming back. Look, he blew off all of his steam and now he needs to cool down. He'll be back. Have a little faith. (suspenseful music) - Open it. What's your name? - Doug. - You willing to bet their lives I don't find another way in? (suspenseful music continues) Open it. - Doug, praise God. What the... Girls, run! (family members screaming) - No, no, no, don't run, don't run. - [Bo] Calm down. Nobody moves. - Up in my room I have jewelry, I can- - Your phones now. Come towards me slowly. Doug, fetching me a bowl of water. - Do what he says. We comply, we don't get hurt. - Right. Everyone, stand over here. No dialing. Let me see your hands. Let me see your phones. Okay. One at a time, walk over and hand me your phones. Back to your family. Next. Keep it on me. Anyone gets hurt, it's me. Is that a deal, Bo? - Won't come to that. In the bowl. Next. In the bowl. One at a time! (dramatic music) - [Fay] Keith! - No games. In the bowl. Come on. Sit down. Put your palms on the ground. All right, I'm gonna take a look around the house. No one make a sound, everyone stays still, lips are sealed. Got it? - It's okay. (door creaking) - Okay. Go ahead and stand up. Look, it's a fuck situation and I'm sorry, truly. But here we are. Doug, I'm gonna be you and your family's guest for the next couple of nights. All of you do as I say, everyone act smart, nothing rash, no heroics, and this will be a breeze. I mean, you're complying so keep it up and I'll be outta your hair as soon as I can, I promise. Okay? Got it? - We didn't do anything to you. - And I don't plan to inconvenience you any more than I already am. I'm up shits creek. I mean, I told your husband earlier, I wish there was a better way. - Let me go, just me, please. I promise you- - Yeah, we are all in this together, I'm afraid. Doug, do you have a screwdriver and a hammer nearby? - What? - A screwdriver and a hammer. - In the study, yeah. - All right. We're gonna flip the door handle and nail shutters closed. Take the screws out, turn the handle around, and seal the window off. (crickets chirping) (hammer banging) (footsteps pattering) All right. Perfect. Just leave the tools on the floor there. All right. Everyone, get in the bathroom, you're gonna be sleeping in there tonight. Hurry. It's been a long night. - Is it cool if we grab pillows? - No, no, we're fine, we're fine. - No, go ahead. - I need this. - Sure. Go. (footsteps pattering) - Couple of nights, I'm gone. (footsteps pattering) (gentle soothing music) (gentle soothing music continues) (Bo panting) (Bo groaning) (gentle soothing music continues) (Bo humphing) (Bo humphing) (clock ticking) (no audio) - Back off. - I'm trying to place where he is. Stop. We're safe. Or do you want to change that? - We're hostages. - Shut up, we're safe. - Dad's right, we need to weather this out, not rock the boat. - Oh shit. Jesus. (floorboards creaking) - Shh, mom. - What's the password for your iPad? - [Doug] My iPad? - I want to go online, I hope it's okay. - [Doug] 2590. (no audio) (Bo groaning) (no audio) (no audio) (gentle music) (Bo moaning) - I'm sorry. - Thank you. - If you're actually sorry, you'll put a lid on freaking out. - I've never seen a gun in person before. - Neither have I. - He's not gonna use it. If he was gonna hurt us, he would've already. - Don't be so sure of that, Chloe. - There's something off about him. - How did he even get the gun? - What matters is, he's dangerous. More so if he thinks we're a threat. - Exactly. Do what he says as he says it. - Oh, and you we're just gotta let him come in here and humiliate us. - Well, what exactly do you suggest, Keith? - We can take him. - You shut the fuck up, he may hear you. - He's upstairs. Don't you remember those pricks at the Giants game? I mean, we showed those men who real men are. - He's got a gun. - Well, I can disarm him. So I've got this new technique to grab a gun. - Do you hear yourself? - An Israeli special forces agent is training me. - I don't care how many overpriced courses you paid for. You risk my family's safety, I'll kick your ass. - Oh, so you talk like a man with me, but a panty with him? - Again, you fucking idiot, he has a gun. - Yeah, one man with a gun is no match for two men in tandem. And you should have learned that in combat where two men in- - Keith, if we are gonna make it through this, we have to focus on deescalation. This is the way we want to handle it. Respect that. - Now listen to me, Fay- - No, you'll listen to me, we've decided. - Okay. All right. - All right. I think we should all try and get some rest now. - Mom, do you want the bathtub? - I'm all right. - Dad? - Mm-mm. - Ruth? - Just take it. (crickets chirping) (bright music) (hostages snoring) - Did you mean it? Would you actually file? - You called me a coward in front of my daughters. - Have you already? - I'm the furthest thing from a coward. Do you know what a coward does? Run. - I felt cornered. I'm sorry. You love me. I love you. - I used to have a husband. You stow away at work, you cancel and lie when I make plans with our friends. - I told you I was sorry I missed Sarah's son's bar mitzvah. - No, it's not just that, you're drinking more. You hide in your office, you never used to. You have to participate. Be a part of this marriage. (no audio) I haven't filed yet, Doug. (gentle soothing music) (birds tweeting) (Bo groaning) (no audio) (crow cooing) (birds tweeting) (crow cooing continues) (bright music) (bright music continues) (bright music continues) (bright music continues) (bright music continues) (oil sizzling) (bright music continues) (bright music continues) (bright music continues) (footsteps pattering) (door knocking) - Morning. Oh, here. I made breakfast. - If that goes up, it's pointed at me, remember? - I wanna talk to you all. Everybody up? - We are. - Our predicament isn't great, but it doesn't have to be terrible. Everyone, please stay cool and where I can see you and let's make the best of this weekend. - I smell eggs. - I make mean scrambled eggs and cook plenty of bacon. - It's better than in here. - Everything's ready for you in the dining room. (footsteps pattering) - Give me a moment. - Does anyone else need to use the restroom? - I do. (water flushing) (water gushing) - You can go on in the dining room. - We'll stick together. - Killer. Who's the artist? - I am. (water flushing) - You got a gift. - Thanks. - Let's eat. - Don't. - I would never mess with someone's food. - I'm not really an egg person. - Then have some bacon. - Switch with me. - Sure. (no audio) You know, this goes smoother if we can trust each other. I mean, let's get to know one another. Tell me about yourselves. - I'm Chloe Freeman. I'll drop out the first day of school intro. (Bo laughing) I'm a Pisces. Liberal, non progressive. I like TV over movies and hate house music. Like actual instruments. And I'm a proud C student. - Killer. Favorite TV show. - Tie between "Full House" and "Breaking Bad." - I remember "Full House." John Stamos. - Yeah. And they have a new Netflix series, but I prefer classic. - I'm Bo. "Storage Wars" is my favorite TV show, but I'd rather watch a monster movie over television. Not a breakfast person, Kyle, was it? - Keith. No offense, I'm vegan. - None taken. You well off, Keith? - What do you mean? - You know, rich. - I'm blessed. Why? - I never met a working man who called himself that. - Blessed? - Vegan. (all laughing) Well, at least have some OJ. - He won't drink those either. Won't go near processed sugars. - There's processed sugar in orange juice? - Loaded with it. And full of preservatives. All made from concentrate. They shouldn't even be allowed to call it fruit juice. - A life with no juice, no bacon? No, thank you. Well, I didn't catch everyone else's name. Again, I'm Bo. It's good to meet you. - I'm Fay. - The artist. - Ruth. - Hi, Ruth. No hard feelings, I get it. I'd be suspicious too. - Lester. - For keeping me out of trouble, not starting it. Are you Fay's brother, Lester? - Fay hired me. - You work for them? I thought you were the gay uncles. - What made you say that? - Well, he looks the most like Fay and they sort of gravitate towards each other, I don't know. Are you a lawyer, Lester? You're kind of dressed like one. - I'm an interventionist. - Like drug interventions? - Mostly I deal with those who suffer from AUD, alcohol use disorder. - So you're some sort of doctor. - Not exactly. - No, he's nothing like a doctor. - Are you the one with the drinking problem, Doug? - According to them. - You don't think so? - I'm sure you've heard the phrase, everything in moderation. - Yeah. - Here we go. - That's not an exact translation of the ancient Greek. The exact translation of the ancient Greek is, nothing in excess. - Okay. - I like my vodka. Am I an excessive drinker? No, I make sure of it. - Yeah, my old man didn't think he was an alcoholic. - Who has the right to draw the line between user and abuser? - Doc. - He's not a doctor. - Lester, what's the professional definition of an alcoholic? - We don't use that term. Common symptoms for someone who suffers from AUD are difficulties with social, familial, or occupational responsibilities due to drinking. - That's vague. - Oh no, not really, honey. - Lying about drinking, drinking to relax. - Who doesn't drink to relax? - Let him talk, Doug. - An inability to go through daily activities without alcohol, along with uncontrollable cravings. One with AUD often suffers from withdrawal symptoms due to chemical and physical dependency. - I'm far from dependent on alcohol. - Ruth, you're sensible. You think he needs it? - Don't ask her, She hasn't been around. - You've had your flask attached to your hip my entire life. I doubt it's changed that much over the last year. - It's my life. Mine. As long as I'm not hurting anyone, I'm free to live the life I want. - I'm going to ask that as long as I stay here, no one drink. We should all be levelheaded. I mean, I'm not going to either. I mean, hell, I can go for a beer right now, but it's for the best. - I don't wanna drink. - I brought over the counter medications to help when you start experiencing minor withdrawal symptoms. - That won't be necessary. - Well, that was good. - So much better than insta eggs. I will never touch that damn excuse for food again in my life. - I used to eat 'em all the time at Camp Hollywoodland. Thanks for making the real deal. - It was a really nice gesture. - No trouble. The least I could do. Lester, would you mind helping me with these? And could you wash up the dishes? We don't want to leave Doug and Fay's home messier than we found it. (laughing) - Right away. - All right, I will help bring them in. - We can all go in the living room. - Killer. Living room's more comfortable. - The situation's changed. His guard is slipping. I'll give you the signal. - Hey, no. - Hey, Keith, I'm gonna grab you a water. - Oh, right. Yeah. - I need to use the facilities. - And I need to go after. (floorboards creaking) (water gurgling) (dramatic music) (water splashing) (water splashing) (dramatic music) - We cool? - As much as we can be. Given the circumstances. - Yeah, that's a sticky one. But keep it this temperature, all's good. - Appreciate the water. - You must be really thirsty, considering last time I drank tap water, you gave me the whole fluoride speech. - Oh, I've heard that one. - I haven't gotten that one but have you heard the aluminum in deodorant rant? - What? - Nothing wrong with being health conscious. You did it yourself? - Not completely. Juan, Robert, and Enrique were fundamental during the construction. - Friends of yours? - We became close by the end of the project. - How long did it take? - Let's see. I added the deck and the dining room later. The girls' rooms were originally one room. The house without the additions took about nine months. - Holy shit. I mean, that's killer. Not a lot of men can sleep under the roof they literally put over their family's head. What year was that? - [Fay] '77. - Hell yeah. Must be crazy here in the '80s. (Bo laughing) (suspenseful music) Hey, Lester, don't worry about putting them away. I'll put everything back where I found it tonight. - I have two more left. - No rush. - With enough dedication and patience, a man can accomplish anything. Why don't you take my chair, it's more comfortable. Who's the musician? Fay, do you play as good as you paint? - Well, Chloe plays and sings beautifully. - That's my guitar. - Creative Pisces. Sure. Been at it a while? - Since I was about 12. - Who taught you? - I just watched a ton of YouTube videos. - Dedication and patience. - More or less. - Well, can I hear a little bit? - You want my sister to perform for you? - No, it's not like that. I mean, for all of us, I mean for- - It's fine. - You don't have to. - I don't mind. I mean, when was the last time I got to play for you? - You sure? - Yeah. Why not? What the hell, I know mom loves it. - You're very talented. - All you Freemans are dripping with it. - Well, what should I play? - You decide. - Oh, I guess I'll just play my favorite. (gentle soothing guitar tune) (gentle soothing guitar tune continues) (gentle soothing guitar tune continues) (gentle soothing guitar tune continues) (all clapping) - Killer. Wasn't that a killer, Lester? Damn. - I love your take on the classics. - Yeah, you really make it your own. - Thanks. What can I say? - Well, thanks for sharing that with us. - Yeah, it's fun. - Makes it look easy. - [Bo] Right? - [Fay] Do you play any instruments, Bo? - I wish. The closest that I come to musical talent is my whistling. I'm a mad whistler. - Awesome. I played for everyone, now's your turn. - All right. - [Chloe] Come on. (Bo whistling) - That was sick! (clapping) I learned "Stairway," That was the first song I learned how to play. - You know, my buddy Dray used to say, it is not bode well that there's only a stairway to heaven, but a highway to hell. (laughing) What about you, Ruth, any talents? - I wasn't really the talent show tape. - [Bo] What kind were you? - Regular. - Actually, she was captain of the women's volleyball team. - And class president. - In high school. - Leadership is 100% a talent. - True. (crickets chirping) - It could be possible, who might have doubt someone's experience? - Well, I've heard countless stories. I mean, it has to be real, so many people deal with ghosts. - Maybe, anything can happen. - I've never seen a rhino in the flesh, but it doesn't mean they're not real. - But you've seen a picture of a rhino. - Well who hasn't? - Well, a picture is proof. Evidence proves what is and isn't there. - There is video of paranormal activity. - Right. They measure waves and signals. - Okay, let me rephrase, repeatable and verifiable evidence. - Do you believe in ghosts? - Certainly. The first apartment complex I moved into was haunted. - Really? - Mr. Monroe was the elevator operator who worked in the building in the '30s. He suffered a heart attack and died. Mr. Monroe was famous for the cigars he always had. At night, you could smell his Cubans when riding the elevator. - Or more likely someone else smokes cigars in the building. - Smoking isn't permitted in the building anymore. - That's not gonna stop anybody. - Okay, hauntings can be explained by natural phenomenon. - Don't you believe in God? - How are they similar? You're not making any sense. - They require faith. - Well, no, faith is very different. - Both are forms of a belief. - The Lord is present every day in everyone's life. Whether or not you believe He's there. - In a repeatable and verifiable way? - Vatican has exorcists. - So? - So the church recognizes hauntings, but you don't? - I'm a Protestant. We don't share the same theology as Catholics. - Bo, may I get a glass of water and reach into my briefcase? - How come? - Doug needs to stay hydrated and I think some medicine would go a long way. - I'll get the water myself. - Are you all right? - Get me the damn pills. - Of course, go. (no audio) (water gushing) - [Lester] Do you have any allergies to medications? - [Doug] Not to my knowledge. - [Lester] Take two of these. It's crucial... - [Fay] Thank you, Lester. (Doug gulping) - Headaches and the shakes come at stressful times. Fighting the shop's lease most of '08 in that bullshit liability lawsuit. - You know what's great for stress relief? Games. - Games? - Like board games? - Right. Have any? - In the basement. - That could be a little difficult. Burn the Witch. Killer game. - I don't know that one. How do you play? - Does that sound good to you, Doug? I mean focus on something else a little while. You don't even have to stand if you don't want. - Explain the rules. - Okay. Well, there is a moderator and a four-person team of village folk, and a two-person team of witches. - Sounds similar to Mafia. - Well, there are plenty of games with similar type names. Go on. - Well, to start, all six players close their eyes and the moderator chooses two people to be the games witches. - How do you know who's who? - Well, hold on, let me explain then I'll answer any leftover questions. So the witches then are allowed to open their eyes and recognize who each other are. The rest of the game is in phases, the trial phase, and of the burning of a suspect. During the trial phase, everyone talks and asks questions, trying to figure out together who a witch could be. The town's folk have no idea, but the witches can try to throw the town's folk off. The next part of the game, the burning of a suspect takes place. And everyone casts their vote as to who they wanna see burned at the stake. And whoever gets the most votes is burned and removed from the game. Before we begin the next trial phase, everyone closes their eyes and the witches select a town's folk member to banish. So we go through phase after phase until either both witches are caught and burned or witches outnumber town's folk. And those are the rules. - What happens if there's a tie in votes during the burning of the witch stage? - Hold on, I think Chloe had the first question. What was yours? - How do the witches know they're witches without spoiling it for everyone else? - The moderator walks around the room and lightly taps the players who are gonna be the witches for the game. - Kind of like Heads Up, Seven Up. - Sure. Lester, you are asking what happens if there's a tie? - Mm-hm. - Good question. There has to be majority vote. - It's definitely Mafia. - Well, it sounds like fun. - All right, well, all clear everyone. Ruth, Doug. - [Doug] Got it. - Well, let's play. - Okay, well, I'll be the moderator for the first game. So everyone close your eyes. (gentle music) (gentle music continues) All right, those I selected as witches may open your eyes and acknowledge each other. Okay, witches, close your eyes. If you were not selected as a witch, you are town's folk and on the opposing team. All right, perfect. Everyone open your eyes. Our beloved mayor has disappeared. All that was left in his room were black cats and a broom. - What? - It's flavor. - We must get to the bottom of this dark magic. We will begin a court session and the town's folk may question one another. - Dad, are you a witch? - No. Are you? - No. - Keith, are you a witch? - No. - Mom, everyone's gonna say no. Chloe, who looks fishy to you. (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) - Mom's gotta be the witch. (laughing) - [Fay] You're being goofy. - Or are you cracking under pressure? I vote for mum. (Chloe laughing) - Dad, is Chloe overselling? Is she a possible witch? - No, if she was, she would've tried to lead from the start. - Wait, are you accusing me? - No, you're doing what you would do if you were on either team. - Maybe it's you, Ruth. - Look at me, I'm not a witch. - Do we have to vote? - It's up to you guys. - Is my mom a witch? Is she? - That's not allowed, he's the moderator. - Oh, you're so guilty, mom. (Chloe laughing) - Okay, we have to let the people vote then we'll know more. Next phase. - Are the town's folk finished questioning for this round? - Yep. - A stake is prepared and a vote must be called. - I vote for mom. - Little cheater. - Oh no, you totally gave it away. I also vote for mom. - See? - Yeah, my vote's for Fay as well. - Same. - Well, we have a majority. The town's folk have decided to burn Fay and she's removed from play. - So you were a witch. (Fay groaning) - Duh. (Chloe and Ruth laughing) - We wait till the end of the game. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Ah, it's all good. I mean, first time we've played together. All right, so everyone still in, close your eyes. Night falls and spells are cast and witches may open your eyes and vote on a town's folk member to banish. - Can I still vote even if I'm dead? - Sure. Another member of our community has mysteriously vanished. The town will miss Chloe. - Damn, damn, damn! - It seems our town has not solved it's witch problem. We must hold a trial and question each other to find the true witches. - Okay, so that was definitely mom. - It would have to be someone who would go along with her. (stomach rumbling) - Did you eat anything this morning? - Well, we can still play, nevermind me. - That was just juice and bacon, and Keith had less. - Yeah, you should eat, mom. - I could eat. - Oh, so what are you gonna fix for us this time? - Well, let's do something easy. I'm not much help with one hand. I was hoping you wouldn't mind fixing dinner. - You want me to cook? - Well, it's really hard for me with one hand. And besides, I don't know your health restrictions. - I'll do it. - No, I'll take care of it. - Perfect. Thanks. - We don't have anything in the fridge for Keith. - Well, wait, I think we have carrots and blueberries. - Enough for everyone? - No, probably not. - Okay, you and Keith can have that and we can have something else. - That works. - I think we have some leftover lasagna. - Plenty. We have plenty. - Homemade lasagna sounds killer. (Keith groaning) (no audio) At the end of this, don't lift a finger. Just leave everything where it's at. I will collect, sort, and wash everything. - Here. (footsteps pattering) - Ow! - Oh, careful, that was in the oven. - Plastic melts. - Cooking stoves don't. - Keeps food moist while cooking and can go in microwaves and ovens up to 350 degrees. (gentle music) - It's a recycled polyurethane. - Yes and safe to eat food in and not harmful to the environment. - Sold. Can I get it at Target? - Nope. - [Bo] Amazon? - They're not making them anymore. - Huh, that's a bummer. Clever idea. - 7.99 clever. - People are cheap. - Doesn't need an excuse, it's survival of the fittest. - Could you have moved the price down a little more? - I mean, maybe if I got it to scale. I'd actually rather not talk about this. - So dad, has your medicine kicked in yet? - Well, let's see. I'm eating and I'm not throwing up so yeah, I guess so. - Glad to see you're feeling a little better. - Thanks. - Maybe you should take some anti-nausea tablets I have. - Really trying to get that overtime, aren't you? - Take it after dinner. - You have a beautiful family. - What about your family? - Chloe. - What? - We're all friends here, it's alright. My family doesn't want me talking with them so I don't have to worry about that. - So sad when families drift apart. - It's inevitable. - What happens in your life is what you allow to happen. - It's about not giving up, accepting the bumpy roads. - So why don't you and your family talk? - That's a long story. - We got time. - Well, I think Fay's right. People give up. I gave up on my dad. My mom gave up on me. Spencer, Nick, and Miles threw in the towel. I don't know, it seems like it's really hard to keep things together and just easy for him to fall apart. Oh, please, leave it. Just leave it. - Can we play Burn the Witch? - If everyone wants. - I wanna redeem myself. - I'm in. - Perfect. Ruth, do you wanna be moderator? - Yeah, if that's what everyone wants to do. (clock ticking) (footsteps pattering) (clock ticking continues) Okay. Witches open your eyes and acknowledge each other. Witches close your eyes. Now, everyone, all at once open your eyes. First phase of questioning will begin in three, two- - You're not gonna add the flavor? - Run it however you like. - Three, two, one. - Chloe, whose team are you on? - Town's folk. - Fay, are you guilty? - No, not this time around. - Let's vote. - Is everyone ready to vote? - I'll skip this round. - He's making the same moves as last time. I vote for him. - Keith was quiet last round. Too quiet. I vote for him. - Yeah, I'm gonna have to agree with mom and vote for Keith. - Doug. - Yeah, first round of voting is over. Majority rules. Keith's out. Stand over here by me and then everyone close your eyes. Witches may now open their eyes. One player is out. Witches point to your vote. Must be unanimous. No one is allowed to talk. (dramatic music) - Move. - Keith! - Oh, God. - I'm not around, down to the floor now. - [Keith] Put the gun down. - Last chance. - [Doug] Keith, listen, drop. Drop, Keith, on the floor. - On the floor, asshole! (gunshot exploding) (dramatic music) (Keith choking) (Keith coughing) (Keith gasping) (dramatic music) (hostages crying) Stop yelling! - Bo. Bo! - I told him! - No one will say anything. - He made me. - Well, my family, I beg you. - He was the fucking one. - You're right. Bo, please, my girls, please. - Do you think I fucking wanted this? You'd all be dead if I wanted. Are you? Oh, get it outside. Doug, Lester, grab the body and take it to the woods and then come back. - Please take my truck, take anything you want. - Now. No one else has to get hurt. - Please. - Are you gonna make me threaten her? - Okay, okay, don't. Lester, get the fuck over here. Fast. - And you both come back. - [Doug] Hurry. Damn it! How far? - Away from here. And then right back. (crickets chirping) - [Doug] Here, here. Gently. Gently. Good job. (Doug humphing) - I'll go get help. (crickets chirping continues) (blows thumping) (dramatic music) (Fay and Chloe crying) - It wasn't supposed to go like this. Chloe, he rushed me. - [Chloe] No. - I'm not. - [Chloe] Stop. Please, stop. Please. (crickets chirping) (footsteps pattering) - At sunset tomorrow, I'm gone. - I'm so sorry for all this hell. I never meant to... Forgive me, - We're sleeping in the bathroom again. (footsteps pattering) (somber music) (somber music continues) (somber music continues) (somber music continues) (water gushing) (somber music continues) (no audio) (broom rustling) (somber music) (somber music continues) (plates cluttering) (water gushing) (no audio) (no audio) (no audio) - What were you thinking? - No one wants to stay in here. Keith! (gunshot exploding) Hey, bitch. (dramatic music) - [Fay] My family. (birds tweeting) (gentle music) (Doug snorting) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) (Doug crying) (gentle music continues) (Doug continues crying) (gentle music continues) (Doug crying) (Bo panting) (Doug retching and coughing) (Doug retching) - These symptoms can be managed with more medication. - Whatever I had before, it worked. - In my briefcase. (Doug panting) - I was out of line. I hope you're not too. Hurt. - Is he not letting us out today? - [Chloe] I don't think he's up. (Doug retching) - You think this will solve our problems? - Well, the medicine will help at least a little. - I'm talking about stopping my drinking. It won't be the silver bullet you hoped for. Nothing changes the way we're headed. - And where are we headed? - Our marriage is circling the drain I drove our daughter away. - Dad. Without you- - Don't try to butter me up. I'm done with people telling me what I wanna hear. I'm a failure with an addiction, not a failure because of it. - You think you're a failure? - I'm fighting for us, Not trying to escape our issues. - If you're fighting for us, I am a failure. I'm your husband, it's my job to keep you secure and fulfilled. - Why do you get to define everything? I say a marriage starts to erode when I see the love of my life pulling away and distancing himself. - I refuse to lose you. - Then act like it. I'm here with you. I'm right here. Are you with me? - I promise I'll be around more. - Someone shouldn't be made to do what they don't want. - Why would you say that? - You look at me different. We force it, we didn't used to. - I moved. Dynamics change. - After your business went bankrupt, I was the one with the experience, I should- - It was my business, it was my responsibility. - You made a great product. - It was a shit product and it was a shit startup. God, you think you're a failure? How am I supposed to feel. - With the right manufacturing- - I avoided you because I hated that I couldn't do what you said I could do. My whole life, everything you said I could accomplish, I did. And my family's next on the line when I wanna start my life outright? I can't. I'm small fish. That's true failure. - I'll throw out all the cooking stoves. - I'm over it. Or mostly, I guess. I'm just licking my wounds for a long time. I just couldn't bear knowing that I'm what made dad sad. - I'm what made me sad. I just couldn't bear seeing you so hurt. I want you to be happy. A good father wants- - Stop saying you're not a good father. You were there for me, I'm no good. You gave me everything. And look what I have to show for it. Nothing. - Is your entire self worth measured in accomplishments? That's not the Ruth we raised. The point is to learn and get back up. - You deserve a daughter who wouldn't make you question how you raised her. I thought I was that person. - You are. You are that person. You are. - A young woman of integrity and dignity. I'm proud of who you are. - Me too. - Love you. (Doug and Fay chuckling) (gentle music) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) - When I leave tonight, wait two hours. I'll be back there. Stay downstairs, do whatever you want. - What's going on? - He said when he leaves to wait, to stay downstairs, do what we want. - Is he leaving? - He's waiting till night fall. - Let's stay in here. - There's no need to be suspicious, let's go into the living room. - I'm not talking to that man. - I don't think he wants to either. - We'll wait it out too. - Right. - He's holding the gun. - It's okay, honey, stay with us. - Get the pills for my dad, Lester. - On it. (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) For Doug. (no audio) - I'll get the water. (no audio) (no audio) (no audio) (Chloe sobbing) (Chloe continues sobbing) (somber music) (somber music continues) (Crickets chirping) (no audio) - Lester, you're gonna gimme a lift in your car. - It's yours. - You are going to drive us until I say stop. The Freemans will wait two hours before getting help. - I can't see. - You're my passenger then. - Where? - Not far. (crickets chirping) (gun cocking) - Promise us you won't hurt him. - I promise. (crickets chirping continues) (footsteps pattering) (crickets chirping) (car engine roaring) (crickets chirping continues) I've never been to Florida.
