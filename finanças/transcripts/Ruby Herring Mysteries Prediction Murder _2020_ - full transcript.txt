Oh, the "death" card... Could be a... a time of renewal. But you are gonna have to let go of this negativity. Just wait. I am... I'm sensing something else. So, with the recent rash of burglaries, leave your lights and a TV on when you're out, lock up your valuables, and don't hide a spare key under the flower pot. The thieves could be watching. And that is news we can use. Linda and Nick? Great information, Ruby, and you have one more trick up your sleeve, in case you ever find yourself a victim of a home invasion? Yes. Criminals often tie up their victims with duct tape, so I'm gonna reveal a little secret on how to escape. Linda, could you give me a hand? Of course. Wrap that around my wrists three times. "Ruby Houdini." Anyone can do this. It's simple physics. See? The tape is super-tight. All you have to do is raise your hands above your head and bring them down fast, like this. - Ready for the real thing? - Ready! Oh, wow! And I call that... "news we hope you never have to use." So true. And before you go, we have an important announcement here on 57 News. Ruby, who has brought you hundreds of eye-opening consumer investigations, is officially joining our crime beat team. Congratulations, Ruby. Thank you, both. I'm looking forward to this next chapter. And we might just have your first crime-beat story. The Seattle Police Department has announced it's reopening a number of cold cases. Beginning with the unsolved murder of psychic Rose Vitello. Known as "The Pawn Reader," she was shot in her North Seattle shop five years ago by an unknown assailant. Detectives say they're re-examining all the evidence, re-interviewing all the witnesses, and say they will leave no stone unturned until her killer is caught. Ruby's relentless pursuit of justice has already solved two Seattle Murders, and my crystal ball tells me that our very own Sherlock Holmes is just getting started. "Sherlock"? More like "Sheer-luck." I suspect she gets that "Herring Hunch" from her dad, John, one of the finest criminal investigators Seattle has. So, let's all raise a glass to Ruby, and a warning to the bad guys out there-- you better watch out. Thank you, all. To the best news team in the business. Cheers! Enjoy yourselves, guys. May the best man or woman win. How about you cover your crime-beat stories and I'll cover mine, and we will see who the best journalist is, Todd? That's an easy one. Excuse me, I've got some awards to shine. Ooh. He's kind of like a snail. Tough on the outside and slimy underneath. Mm. Accurate. Hey, are you still able to help with the reunion? Yeah, I'll be at the high school tomorrow. I heard a rumor that Luke's coming. Have you guys talked, since, uh... Oh. No. But, you know, we're both adults. There's no reason it needs to be... Awkward? On that note, thank you, both, for coming, really. I appreciate it. Oh, we're both proud of you. Well, I'll see you tomorrow. See you. How's my favorite godson? Really good. Any new interesting cases down at the morgue? Actually, it's been kind of slow lately. What are you hiding? Nothing. Did you get that raise you were asking for? Not yet. The new hybrid? Mm-mm. It's a girl, isn't it? Maybe. Dish! Who is she? Her name's Dakota. She's the new ballistics expert at the P.D., but we're just friends. Oh. Sounds promising. I can't wait to meet her. In time. Congrats again, Ruby. Thanks, Tommy. Bye. Want to get a refill? Sure. I saw they reopened the psychic murder. I'm not surprised. That case haunted the department for years, especially my buddy, Detective Quinn, who was the lead on the case. You covered that story, right? Mm. Last one before I retired. Why couldn't they crack the case? Well, there were a lot of suspects, but the murder weapon was never found. A bunch of items were stolen from the pawn shop, including a gun. Burglary gone bad? Possibly. Whoever did it wiped the surveillance video. You know, it always bothered me that the victim was shot at close range during a reading. It felt... personal to me. So who did you think did it? There was one suspect that stuck out. Travis Tru, a rival psychic. Oh, yes. He had threatened Rose, but he was never arrested. Psychic versus psychic... "Prediction: murder." Hmm. Well, I think I'm gonna ask Frank for my first assignment. Hey, if you need me to fend off Todd, I can bring the muscle. I got this, Dad. Okay. I'll dig up my old case file. You're the best. Hmm. "She claimed to see the future, "she was nothing but a fake, but despite her hocus pocus, a life you should not take." "After your run, follow the numbers to the gun." Dad? Meet me at the news station. Huh. A poet with a penchant for crime. What do you make of it? Whoever wrote that is hoping, if we find the weapon, we find the killer. Why not just send the clue to the police? Maybe the poet is the killer, playing a game with us. Either way, I think our wordsmith is hoping that this ends up on the 11:00 news. I just hope you don't end up on the news for the wrong reasons. I'll be fine, Dad. I've got the location. The North River near Shannon Falls. Used to be a popular hiking spot back in the day. I say we follow the coordinates. You think it's safe? I'm coming with you. I'll drive, and we're calling the police. Okay, keep me posted. Call Detective Killian. Okay... Aw, yes... Oh, oh, oh... no, no, no! Don't-- don't go... ay-yi. Detective Killian. Hi, it's Ruby. Are you free? Oh, it's my day off. I was just, uh... You're baking, aren't you? How can I help you? Yeah, can you meet me at the North River? Near Shannon Falls, off of Interstate 90. I'll send you the coordinates. I'm afraid to ask. I think it involves a cold case. See you soon? See you soon. I haven't seen you use that thing since I was 10 and we went looking for "pirate treasure" on Alki Beach. Oh, we brought in quite the haul that summer. Yes, we did. Did you hear that? I don't like this. It's probably just an animal. Great. This looks like the area. - Yeah? - Yeah. All right. Here you go. What's that? Let's see. No, that's just a metal pole. I hope this isn't a fool's errand. - Oh... - What's that? I got a major hit. Dad... it's a gun. Yeah. Looks like a .38 Special, six-shot revolver. A lot of older cops carry 'em. Not just for old-timers... I got one myself. Detective. John. So, you wanna tell me what I'm doing here... and why there's a revolver in the water? Someone left that at my door. You're thinking the psychic murder? Yep. And I think that's the gun that killed her. You gotta be careful, Ruby. That's what I said. Okay. Point taken. Well, the serial number's been filed off. I'll get the evidence team out here. And get our new ballistics expert to get on this. Dakota? Yes. Tommy mentioned her. Think he might have a little crush. Oh, well, that's an interesting match. Wow. You came prepared. And I'm coming with you. Oh! Oh! Uh, Ruby. Detective. Tommy. Hi. I'm Ruby Herring. I know exactly who you are. "News we can use." Loved your segment on the best make-up brands that don't test on animals. "Humane makeovers." I'm glad you liked it. Tommy has me hooked on your reports. Isn't she incredible? Yeah. Um, the revolver? Oh, yes. Of course, Detective. Well, that's my cue to leave. Have fun getting to the bottom of this one. See you at the gun range later. Gun range? What have you done to my Tommy? Horrible aim. But really sweet of him to show me the ropes, Hey, listen, if, um, if you feel uncomfortable with a reporter here-- Are you kidding? Come to my work station. So, what's happening here? It's called "raising" the serial number. When the metal's stamped, it's compressed. The acid eats away at the softer metal surrounding that. I think we're getting something. Bingo. There's your serial number. Nice work. I'll get a trace request going. I still need to do a test fire to prove that the bullet from the crime scene actually came from this revolver. That will never fire. It's completely rusted out. Not in my lab, Detective Skeptic. I might have some more magic in my hat. I just need a bit more time. Oh, and I almost forgot. A bullet was left in the chamber. It was crazy corroded, so I sent it off to the FBI lab for rush testing. Good job. You keep me posted. - Mm-hmm. Detective Killian. Yeah, I'll be right there. Something with the case? Uh, another one. I gotta go. - Thank you, Dakota. - Mm-hmm. And. Ruby, as usual, per department protocol, I'll send out a-- - Press release when you... - ...press release once I have-- - ...have more information.-- - ...more information. - Yeah. - Yeah. Okay. Tommy says you're quite the sleuth. I call it a dash of persistence and a pinch of luck. Oh, something tells me it's a little more than luck. Aw, you're sweet. Here's my number. Oh, and you should know, Tommy's one of the good ones. Text me, okay? - Will do. Hey, Dad. Ruby. I found the old police case file. And I've got the serial number. You said a gun was stolen from the pawn shop the night of the murder, right? Right. I got the info right here. Is the serial number listed? Sure is. Okay, I'm sending you the number now. It's a match. We may have found our killer. The revolver was registered to Elijah Bards. Oh. Looks like Elijah's not gonna be doing too much right now. Why not? Because he died. Mm. The victim was a medium. Maybe she was killed by Elijah's angry ghost. The police file said that he had a son, Henry Bards. - Henry? - Yeah. He's the one who sold the gun to the pawn shop. Oh, he's the pro at Redwoods Golf and Tennis Club. Hmm. You know what? It's been a while since I've had a golf lesson. I will book you in. Oh. Golf, huh? Looks like someone has a little extra time on their hands. I guess that makes sense, when you get a hot story handed to you on a silver platter. Handed to me? Well, unless you magically knew where the murder weapon was hidden. You must be part psychic yourself. That's right, Todd. I cast a magic spell called "following the lead." You see... viewers trust me to find the truth, so they send me tips. Oh, Todd. That reminds me. Someone called in with a tip for you. Caller said someone's been stealing lawn ornaments on Mercer Island. Expensive ones. Wow. Who knew Seattle's elite had lawn ornaments? Actually, in that neck of the woods, they're known as "sculptures." Ah. Now... if you'll excuse me, my people await. "My people"? He's just a couple million bucks short. Okay, call me if anything exciting or newsworthy happens. And I am off to high school. Oh, good thing you don't look a day over 17. Ah! I like it. Hi. I'm Ruby Herring. Derek Saylor. Yeah, we signed up to help volunteer. Yes, of course. I'm Sloan Waller. I'm one of the teachers here. Thank you so much for helping us out today. We have you guys on gift bags and decorations. Oh, great. I'm so excited for your dance-off rematch with Beau. Oh, it's hard to believe the shellacking I took. This time, I'm ready. So good. Oh, did somebody call a doctor? I have some gift bags to fill up. Mm-hmm. - Ah, hi, Luke. - Hi. I heard you were coming to town for the reunion. Yeah. I mean, it's been so long since I've seen everyone. How have you been? Good. Yeah, good. Congratulations on your promotion. Oh. You saw that. Yeah, I always watch your reports online. Thanks. Hey, so, I was wondering if we could get together before the reunion. I don't know. Say, dinner? Tomorrow night? Let me think about it, okay? Okay. I hope to see you tomorrow. Hi. I'm Luke Baldwin. I'm here to help. Is someone a smitten kitten again? You forgotten the part where we broke up the day of our wedding? It was mutual. Not insurmountable. What? There's still hope. You two are so good together, and you could do a lot worse than a cardiologist. Yeah, well, that hope is long gone, along with our Maui honeymoon deposit. - Mm. - Ugh. Nice swing. Are you my 1:00? I am. Ruby Herring, and thanks. Well, I'm, uh, Henry. It's nice to meet you. So, uh, how'd you hear about me? Rumor has it you're the best pro around. And you played on the amateur tour? Yeah, for a while. But you know golf, it's kind of a mindset. I could never quite master that part of it. Here, try another swing, but keep this arm straighter this time. Right. Good. So did you ever try a sports psychologist? Yeah. I tried everything. Even a psychic? Ruby? What a coincidence. Jake. Henry Bards? Yes. Jake Killian, Seattle P.D. What's going on here? I'd like to ask you a few questions about Rose Vitello, the psychic. Is this about you reopening the case? I saw that on the news. Yeah, we're taking another look. Did you know her well? Um, no, not really. Is this your partner or something? No. You mind if we talk about this somewhere else? So, Rose Vitello-- what's your connection? My ex-fiancée, Sloan, she used to see Rose for readings. A lot. Sloan Waller? Mm-hmm. I understand she and Rose were close. That's an understatement. Sloan couldn't do anything without consulting her first. You didn't like that? Psychics, they're such... You know what? I'm gonna stop right there, before I say something I'm gonna regret. You said Sloan was your ex-fiancée. What happened? Well... Apparently, our stars didn't align. Was the breakup bad? Yeah, it was pretty rough. Luckily, I met Monica and she helped me pick up the pieces. Then, well, we fell in love. Monica? My wife. Actually, we're having a baby. Congratulations. Do you know if it's a boy or a girl? It's too soon. I shouldn't have said anything. It's too early. We haven't even told our families yet. Our lips our sealed. Right? Right. When's the last time you talked to Sloan? Well, not since she broke up with me five years ago and moved to Singapore to teach English. I heard she's back in town, subbing at Patriot High School. Right. I think I met her last night at the high school. I'm volunteering for my reunion. So, why'd you pawn your dad's six-shooter? Guns aren't really my thing, so I just wanted to get rid of it. Honey? You forgot your lunch. Can we pick up this golf lesson some other time-- if you actually were here for a lesson? I'll be in touch. Why'd you let him go? I mean, he's your closest connection to the murder weapon, and he was definitely acting like something was up. Oh. "You have the right to remain silent, for acting like something's up." I'm being serious. I mean, didn't you notice he was being defensive? Almost angry. All right, we're talking about a revolver that came from a random clue, that we haven't even linked to the crime yet. By the way, nice swing you got there. Thanks. I was on my college team. Do you play? Here and there. Actually, there's this, um, charity golf tournament the department puts on every year. I was thinking about entering. Since you seem to know what you're doing, I... Wait a second. Are you asking for my help with something? I'm asking you to donate your time for charity. I need some light coaching. Well, I am a sucker for a charity case. We should get you some clubs. There is a pawn shop just up the road. I see where this is going. Well played. People came from all over to tap into Rose's "gift." She must've been really good. If you believe in that sort of thing. I take it you don't. Rose had great intuition, but she was all smoke and mirrors. How did that affect your relationship? Mm, let's just say we were very different people. Your mom and dad divorced? Yeah. I'm sorry. Why? Rose drove him away. She treated her clients like gold, but us, on the other hand... You ever meet a client named Sloan Waller? Ohh... Of course. You didn't like her? She was just... always around, you know? Did, uh, Rose and Sloan ever have a falling out? Sloan was the daughter she always wished she had. Her ex, on the other hand... Henry? Yeah. Henry. Henry thought Rose was scamming Sloan. She spent a lot of money on her services, including the down payment they had saved for their house. Henry threatened to sue Rose. I didn't see that in the file. That's because all the money was in Sloan's account. But I think what really got Henry mad was when Rose told Sloan she shouldn't marry him. Thought she could do better than a washed-up golfer. Ouch. These are pretty pieces. Are they all real? Yeah. Yeah, Rose refused to sell fake jewelry in the shop, and I decided to keep it that way. I can, um, give you a deal on an engagement ring, if you'd like. Uh... no. I'm good. Thanks. Is there any way we could see the backroom? Of course. I found her laying there, on the ground. Her "evil eye" necklace was just staring up at me. So no surveillance back here? Rose believed in privacy for the clients. She had video in the store, but the footage was stolen that night. Rose was in a reading when it happened. Did she keep a client schedule? She did, but there was no record of this one. What were the cards that were left on the table? Just one. The "Magician" card. 78 in a deck, and, to Rose, every single one was the gospel. Did she use a crystal ball? Oh, no, she didn't believe in that. That was Travis Tru's thing. "The Truth Teller." Yeah. He threatened to kill her on a group chat. Said the "Death" card was coming for her. How did their issues start? Rose was blabbing all over town that Travis was a fraud. Then these random bad reviews started popping up online. He figured she was having people write them. Okay. Well, I've got enough for now. Thanks for your time. I'm sorry for your loss. Rose is in a better place now. Well, up for the driving range, later? Uh, sorry, I have an early dinner with my dad. Tomorrow? Yeah. Tomorrow. Great. What does your gut tell you about the golfer? I find it suspicious that Henry never mentioned that Rose was the reason his fiancée dumped him. He had way bigger issues with her than he let on. And my favorite psychic? Mr. Tru? Ah, I've always been curious about crystal balls. Might need a glimpse into my future. Buckle up. He's a character. So, the police file that your friend gave you doesn't have everything on the case, but it's been really helpful. How so? Well... Rose was wearing her ruby ring and her diamond "evil eye" necklace when she was murdered. If it was a burglary, wouldn't the perp have stolen those, too? They were listed as costume jewelry. Yeah, but how would the killer know that? Her daughter, Emily, said that Rose only sold the real thing to her customers. And the killer would know that, if they knew Rose well. Exactly. Like her daughter. It was... strange. Emily kept calling her mom "Rose." It was so cold. Not to mention, with her mom gone, she inherited the store. You think she could've done it? She definitely had the means, motive, and opportunity. Hey. The evidence log lists 77 tarot cards. Emily said that there was 78 in a deck. Look at that. It's Luke. John Herring. Luke! It's good to see you again, man. How long are you in town for? Oh, a couple days. For the reunion. All right, well, listen, take my seat. I'm late for a basketball game with the other professors. Dad. What? They need their star player. I'll catch up with you later. See you, John. Hi. Sorry. Busy day. Luke. I can't believe it's you. It's been years. It has been years, Kiki, and I have been praying for a piece of that famous cherry pie of yours. Coming up. What happened to your dad? Oh, he had to leave. Ah, but I am very happy to take his place. Ruby, there's something I need to say to you. I wanted to apologize for how things left off between us. Hey, look, that was both of our decision. You know, you dreamt of something bigger than Seattle, and I wanted to stay close to home. I'm just glad we realized it wasn't gonna work out before we said "I do." Well, it looks like cold feet got the better of us. So, are you... single? Yes. Mm-hmm. How about you? Yeah, I am now. I was dating an actress, but let me tell you, they can be a handful. Yes. I can only imagine. One takeout order coming up, Detective. Okay. Thank you, Kiki. So, how do you like working on the crime beat? You know, hanging out with all those cops? They're nice. They've been mostly helpful. Thank you. And crime is definitely interesting. But it has shown me that everyone has secrets. Oh, yeah? What are some of yours? It's a work emergency. Raincheck? Hey, um, wait. Would you be my date to the reunion? For old time's sake? Uh... You know what? Maybe. Let me call you. Okay? Oh, I see Dakota's keeping you in the loop. Yeah, she is. Gotta love her for that. Did you know one of those tarot cards was missing from Rose's deck? There were 77 listed in that log. Mm. Guess the original detective missed it. I'll check the evidence box. Dinner of champions, huh? Hey, take what I can get when I'm on duty. How's dinner with your dad? Oh, he had to leave early. Hmm. Oh! You were at the diner. Might've been. So you saw... - Maybe. - ...Luke. Yeah, he just showed up, and my eternally optimistic father just left me there with him. He was your ex, I take it? Yeah. What? Nothing. Look, Dakota's waiting, and whatever she has, she says is a game-changer, so... The revolver on its own was too rusty to fire, as you predicted, but all we really need is the barrel, so I removed the old barrel and I attached it to a new base. And guess what? It fired? A clean shot. Once a bullet passes through the barrel, it's left with a one-of-a-kind imprint. They're called "striations." Like a fingerprint. Exactly. From there, I was able to compare my test bullet to the bullet found at the crime scene. And? Perfect match. We officially have our murder weapon. Nice work. Time to put some pressure on our killer. Ruby? Go ahead and report this. Refreshing! And exciting. Good scoop! Thanks to you. Be sure to mention that to Tommy. I think you two could make a good match. Are you and Jake...? Oh. No. You will be. I've got a weird sixth sense about these things. I've been hearing that a lot lately. See you on TV. Our top story today-- breaking news in the murder of psychic Rose Vitello. An anonymous tip has cracked the case wide open, and crime-beat reporter Ruby Herring has the exclusive details. Ruby? This cold case is heating up fast. A revolver was discovered on the outskirts of Seattle, and I can confirm it was the weapon used in the murder. Again? "You're on the right track, but pick up the pace. The killer's still out there, and the tape's not erased. Press 'play' and follow the way." That's Rose's shop. The day of the murder. Caucasian male. And that's Rose. He looks angry. Mm. Someone came in after him. This is where it cuts out. Can you go back? Mm-hmm. Yeah. There. I can't make out his face. Can you zoom in? Mm-hmm. That's as far as I can go. Are those golf clubs on his hat? I think so. Henry Bards! So why did you go see Rose that day? My fiancée left me because of her. I couldn't just let it go. That's something you may have wanted to mention the first time we talked. Well... you made me very nervous. You know, it's quite the coincidence that the revolver you owned was a positive match to the murder weapon. Why would I sell Rose the gun just to steal it back? Maybe to cover your tracks? Anyone could've stolen that gun. Yeah, but not everyone had motive like you did. Sloan hadn't been happy for a long time. Rose just made us both see what was right in front of us. Someone entered the shop... right after you that day. Do you remember this person? Yeah. He was kind of eccentric-looking. Hmm. This guy? That's him. Do I need a lawyer? Why? Do you have anything to hide? No. Mrs. Winters? Ruby! Hi. Call me Gladys, dear. You're not a student anymore. I brought your favorite-- banana-flavored taffy. You're such a dear. These aren't easy to find! Well, if anyone can, it's our investigative reporter. I'm on the crime beat now. You don't say. You know... the only time you were on the wrong side of the law was when you and Derek set the frogs free in science class. Mr. Scattergood was so mad. Oh, he was hoppin' mad. You had everyone chanting. "Free Kermit!" ...Free Kermit! Kermit? Free Kermit! This thing's dangerous. Don't worry. These kids don't even know who "Kermit" is. So, are you here about the reunion? Actually, I was hoping you could help me find Sloan Waller. Ms. Donovan's sub. She's on a spare right now. A lot of the teachers unwind out in the courtyard. Thanks, Gladys. See you this weekend. See you then. Sloan? Yes. Hi. Ruby Herring. We met the other night in the gym. Yes. Hi. I don't know if you know, but I'm a reporter with 57 News. Uh, sorry. I haven't seen the news in a while. I've been out of the country. Singapore, right? Yeah. Just got back a month ago after five years. I missed Seattle. How'd you know that, anyway? I've been assigned to the Rose Vitello murder. You knew her? Rose. Rest her soul. I'm actually scheduled to go to the police station tomorrow for an interview. Apparently, they're talking to everyone again. Were you able to help with the initial investigation? Not really. I knew a little bit about Rose's relationships, but that's it. You two were tight? I lost my mom and dad when I was a little girl and my grandmother raised me. Rose became like family. That's nice. I actually met her daughter, Emily. Emily. Did you like her? Look, I don't want to say too much. Emily didn't have a whole lot of respect for Rose. How so? She was always questioning her mother's gift. Did you believe in Rose's gift? I did. But it was more than that. My ex hated that I spent so much money on her, but what he didn't understand is that Rose gave me love and guidance in return. Makes sense. Why did you leave for Singapore? It's gonna sound cliche, but I needed to find myself again. Henry and I were supposed to get married, and I called everything off right before the wedding. I went through something painfully similar. Actually, my ex is in town for the reunion. Huh. Good luck. So, what... what happened with you and Henry? We drifted apart. It was for the best. He wasn't the right man for me. Better to figure that out before you say "I do." - Right? - Mm. And the invitations had already gone out, the venue was paid for. We even had our engagement photo in the paper. How did Henry take it? He was mad. A little embarrassed. I felt terrible. I actually have to get going to my next class. Sure. Oh, by the way, Uh, I heard that Rose had some issues with Travis Tru, another psychic. He was a total fraud. So many of them are. See you later. Bye. Derek? Any interest in knowing what the future holds? Can I help you? Yeah. I'm Detective Jake Killian, Seattle P.D. I'd like to ask you a few questions about Rose Vitello. When is this thing gonna die? Pardon me? Sorry. Poor choice of words. It's just I already talked ad nauseam with that other detective about Rose. I didn't kill her, I don't know who killed her, and I can't predict who killed her. I still have a few questions for you. I need to do a reading on you first, feel your energy. It's the only way I can trust you. You know, no disrespect, but, um, I don't do psychics. I prefer "intuitive advisor." I just have a few questions for you. Sit down with me, or sit down with me and my lawyer. Ah, fine. Hmm. That looks like Jake's car. Uh, we should leave. Oh, no. We're not leaving. Let it all go. Silence your mind. Connect... with the universe. What, you need my palms, or...? Shh! Should I think of a number? Silence. Just relax. Close your eyes. Your aura is balled up like a cobra. Why are you so uptight, Detective? I'm not "uptight." Just bre-e-e-eathe. I am breathing. I'm always breathing. I'm receiving a communication. From who? An older woman is here with us. Very special. I'm feeling... a "D." Or a "B..." A "B," her name starts with a "B." My grandma's nickname was "Babs." She says that she loves you, and to always remember what she taught you. I smell... vanilla? I helped her bake when I was a kid. She's always with you. But I'm sensing a new woman in your life... a fiery gem. Oh! That's you! She makes you smile... and also makes you crazy. But I see a rival on the horizon... competition for her affection. She's close. Hello? Is someone there? Ruby? Hi! How long have you been standing there? Oh, we just got here. The whole time. - Derek! - You know psychics freak me out. This negative energy is clogging my chakras. I think you all should leave. You said the death card was coming Rose's way. Did you kill her? No. I just wanted to scare her. I spent hours talking to that detective five years ago, and now I'm done. Leave. I'm gonna wait in the car. Well, thanks a lot. I was about to get him to talk. Not to mention I had to listen to that guy tell me how to "relax." He was eerily good, though, don't you think? I don't think he did it. Are you getting another one of your "Herring Hunches"? Because you know those aren't admissible in court. No, it's just... why would you threaten to kill someone on a public forum, and then actually do it? Not a smart move. Well, he thought his comment was anonymous. And that tip you gave me, about the missing tarot card? That was the "death" card. Still... Well, all I know is I can see into my future right now-- three hours of listening to an original interview with an "intuitive advisor." Mm-hmm. Well, if you're not too sleepy in the morning, I will be at the driving range. See if we can't work out some of that balled-up energy, "cobra." Yeah. Hi! Can I get you something? Yeah. A muffin would be great. Monica, right? Yeah. Oh... you were talking to Henry the other day. Yeah. Yeah, I still want that lesson. He's really good. Yeah, he is. It's a shame he quit the tour. He had so much promise. Yeah, he said it was something about "mindset." Yeah. What got him rattled? Sloan. His ex. Wow. She threw him off his game? He was hung up on her, and she barely noticed. And she was so into that psychic. I hate to say it, but when Rose died and Sloan left town, Henry became a different man. He was so much calmer. How soon after his breakup did you two get married? Couple months. Wow! Quick. And I hear you're expecting? Henry told you? Don't worry, I won't-- I won't say a word. Well, we've been trying for a while. It's our little miracle. Well, that's wonderful. Ah, I didn't mean to keep you. Oh, here. Keep the change. You enjoy your day. Thanks. Good morning. Morning. Wow, those clubs are... dated. These are my grandpa's. Bab's husband? Yes. Grandpa Fred. Mm. Yeah, well, my dad gave me this bag 10 years ago. I've since traded up the clubs. Might be time for a new set. We'll see, we'll see. Well, why don't you grab a club out of there? Let's see what you've got. All right, let's try this rusty five. Great. Okay. Ah. So, I was talking to Monica, Henry's wife, before you got here. She didn't have anything nice to say about Sloan or Rose, to say the very least. Well, I'm not surprised. Her husband got dumped by one, and might've killed the other. Okay. Okay, hang on. Okay, um, at the top of your swing, you're just leaning back on your heels a little. - Can I...? - Mm-kay. - Do you mind? - Not at all. Okay, great, now bring your arms up. - Mm-hmm. - Bring your arms up... Great. Now you feel this? Hmm. Yeah. - Better? - Yeah. Hmm. Feel that? - Yeah, right. - Yeah. Better. Right... - There you go. - Got it. So I hear Sloan's coming in for an interview today? How'd you know that? Might've bumped into her at the school again. Ahh. Did she say anything I should know? Well, the, uh, the breakup with Henry was definitely one-sided. Sloan was calling the shots. Hmm. Okay, now, at the bottom of your swing-- Yeah? ...right when you come through, keep your weight centered and swing through your hips. Ahh... - Feel that? - Yeah, I do. Okay. Yeah, but Monica seemed to think that Sloan cared more about Rose than him. Try one. Mm. Yeah, those psychics sure have a hold on people. Tch. I don't get it. Nice! Yeah! Better. There you go. - Great. Thanks. - You're welcome. So, um... what's the deal with your ex? Luke? He's a cardiologist from California and he goes to Africa twice a year to perform free surgeries on children. Wow, the underachiever type, huh? Exactly. Were you two just, uh, catching up, or...? Yeah. Yeah, the last time I saw him was on our wedding day. You know, the one that didn't happen. Mm. Can I ask...? Oh. You know what? We were... we were together so long, it's just... we were doing what we thought was the next logical step. But... logic isn't a reason to get married. Love is. So how was seeing him again? Awkward. At first. You know, we have so much history together, and we're also going to the same reunion this Saturday, so... Any chance you two will get back together, you think, or...? I... Well, hey, you only deserve the best, so. So I've been hearing a lot about how upset Henry was with Rose, over you. I mean, she had this intuition that we wouldn't last, and I trusted her. Was Henry ever violent? No. He did have a temper, but... Yeah? How so? Well, this one time on the golf course, he got so frustrated that he started chopping all the flowers with his sand wedge and calling everyone a cheater. Did Henry ever hurt any people? Not that I'm aware of. Just because someone's angry sometimes doesn't make them a killer. Well, that depends. Ruby, right? Hi again. Do you have any other golf clubs? Preferably not in pink. I did get a set in, as a matter of fact. Over there. Oh. Great. Do you play golf? Do pigs fly? I take that as a "no." It's just it's not really my sport. I'm more into hiking. My dad really liked golf, though. Did your mom ever meet anyone new? There was one guy who caught her eye. A boat captain. Richard. He does dinner cruises. On the Sound? Emerald Cove Tours. How did they meet? She was hired as a psychic at a bachelorette party on his boat. He convinced her it was "in the cards" they needed to date. She found him handsome in a rugged kinda way. Did you like him? He's not a "forever" kind of guy. So I take it, it didn't last with the captain? Rose broke up with him when she found out that his rough side was really rough. How so? Something bad happened on a commercial fishing boat. I-I don't really know, but it spooked her. Then she quickly found out you do not dump Richard. He did not take it well. Did the police talk to him about the murder? I'm sure they did, but they need to again. They also need to be talking to Henry. Did you figure out anything else about him? Oh, no. That detective doesn't tell me anything. So, what hikes do you like? I've been looking for some new trails. Oh. Well, anywhere I can disappear, really. Less people, the better. Can I ask you something? Sure. Why do you call your mom "Rose"? I call her "Rose" because she never treated me like a daughter, more like an inconvenience. Now, if you don't mind, I'd rather not to talk about it. Of course. So, um, the golf clubs-- I'll take 'em. How much? Top of the line. A thousand bucks. They were worth $1,500 five years ago. I'll give you 500. Sold. Angela? I need you to trace somebody for me. His name is Richard. He's a boat captain with Emerald Cove Tours. On it. Richard Kirk is his full name. Wait. That would make him Captain Kirk. Funny. Not a Trekkie. Okay. I am searching for the criminal record. Whoa. What? This guy's got a rap sheet a mile long. He's violent, Ruby. Yeah, something happened on a fishing boat. Yeah. Here it is. He was accused of homicide on the high seas, for killing a guy on a boat. Um... He went to trial. It was a hung jury. They never re-tried him. Please tell me you are not going to see this guy. I have to. Story research. Ruby, please. I'll be fine. You better be. Bye. Bye. What do you want, lady? Sorry, you scared me. Captain Kirk? Who's asking? Hi. I'm Ruby Herring. 57 News. The boat show was last month, Judy. It's Ruby. I-I wanted to ask you a few questions about the case that I'm working on. You know, you shouldn't be out on the docks by yourself. It's not safe for a lady here at night. I wanted to ask you a few questions about Rose Vitello's murder. What about it? I heard you two had a falling out. Ah. You've been talking to her daughter, haven't ya? Yeah, she didn't like me much. Did she have a reason? Thought I wasn't good enough for her mom, but she didn't even like her. Blamed Rose for driving her father away. Just another angry girl with daddy issues. Angry enough to kill? Who knows? But Rose did say that Emily was skimming off the top at the pawn shop. I told her to turn her into the cops, you know, teach her a lesson. Did she? She threatened to do it, but I don't think she ever did. Women. Told my son to never get married. They're not worth the hassle. Well, thank you for your time. Hey. Wanna go grab a drink? I'll pass. I'm buying. I said no. Thank you. Come on, Judy! Hey! You heard the lady. Hey, relax, John Wayne. Don't want no trouble. All right, what were you thinking, Judy? Cute. But I had it under control. Let me guess. Angela? She was worried. Look, this guy? He's dangerous. I'm assuming you already checked out his alibi from the night of the murder? Rock-solid. And the harbormaster's log showed he was out on the water when she was killed. He was on his nightly cruise. He seems like such an obvious suspect. Well, I could've saved you a trip out here, if you'd called me. Shoot. I'm late for something. Mr. Be-Still-My-Beating- heart surgeon? I promised him a quick bite to eat. Maybe I'll stick around and share some takeout on the Love Boat. Who needs rescuing now? Right. See ya. Sorry I'm late. Ah, that's okay. You look nice. Thanks. How's your trip been so far? Oh, you know, being back with Mom and Dad it's the best. Your mom is a riot. I still can't believe she hired a skywriter when you graduated top of your class in medical school. Hey, do you remember when we went up to Victoria and sat on that whale-watching boat for six hours, and me, I didn't even see a thing, because all I could notice was you. Then we walked back from the marina in the pouring rain. And we ducked into that antique shop, and there it was, in the display case-- princess cut, rubies all around it. It was the perfect engagement ring. Yeah, it was. I still have it, you know. You do? Mm-hmm. What are we doing? Getting reacquainted. So... will you be my date to the reunion? Hi, Kiki. Two nights this week. What do you kids want? Coffee? Dessert? I will take another slice of your apple pie, of course. She will have ice cream. Strawberry, right? I'm-- I'm good, Kiki. I'll just have coffee. Thanks. How hard is it to remember vanilla ice cream? It's the most boring flavor on the planet. So that's it? You're gonna let ice cream determine your future? What future? It's not like he was down on one knee. It's not that simple. How does Jake factor into all this? We're just friends. I'm not even sure we're that, half the time. Would you get back together with Luke, if he asked? I don't know. He's smart, funny, handsome. He's perfect on paper. Yeah, so are fish and chips, Ruby. Question is, is he perfect for you? Can we change the subject? Anything? Like the case. And that's your not-so-subtle way of telling your old man to butt out, got it. Hey, no. You know that I always value your advice. You are the smartest man that I know. Ohh. So. Fill me in. I went to see Rose's ex, a boat captain. Rough character, right? Yeah. But with a good alibi. So? He was accused of killing someone on a fishing boat. Really? What was his alibi again? He was out on one of his dinner cruises when Rose was murdered. And the police are 100 % sure? I mean, apparently, it was in the harbormaster's log. The boat was definitely on the Sound that night. Maybe worth verifying yourself? See? Smartest man I know. Thanks for the walk. Well, you'll figure it out, and I'm always here if you need me. Love you, Dad. Love you. Can I help you? Mr. Fontana? At your service. Ruby Herring. 57 News. I hear you keep a log of the boats that go out. Sure do. Goes back decades. We got a good, old-fashioned filing system. Pencil and paper. I don't like change much. What do you need? I was looking for the log from March 22, 2015. Emerald Cove Tour boats apparently went out, helmed by Captain Kirk. I'll get that for you. That's a popular log. A detective came by. Said he wanted to look at that, too. I've got it right here. Yeah. Let's see... March 22nd. Yep. "Captain Richard Kirk." He said he has a son. Do you know his name? Sure do. "Captain Kirk Junior." Could he have been the one operating that night? Did anyone confirm with the guests that it was actually Richard Kirk Senior? Well, I don't know, but that boat goes out like clockwork every night, 7:00, Senior at the helm. Would you have a list of the guests from that night? Oh, that'd be long gone by now. But there is one thing that we do computerize around here. We started saving video surveillance about five years ago-- liability purposes. The detective never took a look at this? Well, he seemed satisfied with the log-- that, and he had an eyewitness. Me. I saw Richard get on the boat that night, just before 7:00. There it is. Just like the log said... Boat took off 7:00 p.m. that night. Can you go back to before the passengers got on? Mm. Is that his son? Yeah, that's him. Son of a gun. Senior traded places with Junior. Do you mind if I record this with my phone? No. You think that detective's gonna want to see this? Oh, you can count on it. It's not my fault my son didn't write "Junior" at the end of his name on the log. He's my back-up. Yeah, but still, you lied to the original detective about being on the boat that night. Why? Didn't feel like getting tangled up in another investigation. You know we can add "perjury" to your extensive rap sheet. Better than "murder." Where'd you go that night? After you left the boat. To see Rose. To talk. About what? I wanted her back. I mean, it's not every day a pretty pearl like her is into an old barnacle like me. How'd she feel about that? Ah, she was done with me. So I said goodbye and left. I'm not one to beg. I heard you took it a lot harder than that. Look. I didn't do it. There was no way I'm going back to the joint. I spent a year in there before my trial. Never again. How did Killian miss this? I kinda got there first. Beat the brass? Nice. He's interviewing Captain Kirk as we speak. You think "beam me up, Scottie" could've done it? He has a violent past, but if he wanted to get rid of the gun, why not just throw it in the ocean? He was out on the water every night. True. And those clues you got didn't really connect to him, right? They seem to point more toward Henry, but it doesn't mean Richard didn't do it. I wonder who sent you those clues. Emily? Travis Tru, maybe? Speaking of... I checked out Mr. Tru for you. He's got an arrest record. Sealed. Darn. Good thing I've got connections at the courthouse. Ah-hah! What was he arrested for? Fraud. Travis bilked tens of thousands of dollars out of his clients for some phony crystal procedure. Rose convinced them to go to the police. When he found out, he was irate. I think it's time to see if the "Truth Teller" is really telling the truth. Good luck with that. Hello, Ruby. Please. Please. Sit for a reading. I'm good. You're troubled. Torn. You know, I was-- I was wondering if you could tell me more about your arrest. I heard that Rose was leading the charge against you. You're afraid. Afraid to make the wrong decision, again. Okay. This isn't about me. Rose tried to ruin you. Rose was a wretched woman who practiced hocus-pocus. She deserved to die. Your ex left you at the altar, didn't he? No! No, that was a mutual decision. And how do you know that? I'm psychic, remember? Why have you been looking into me? I haven't... Ruby Marie. How about you stay out of my life, and I'll stay out of yours? Did you send me those clues? We're done here. Leave. Now! Whoa! What, are you a psychic now? I'm here because I found out about the lawsuit. Yeah. I don't think he's talking anymore. Really? But I do think that Travis knows who killed Rose. Why? He might've been the one who sent me those clues. He knew all this stuff about my life, and then he used the words "hocus pocus," like in the first clue. Dakota. The FBI found something. So get this. When a person loads a bullet, their fingers leave behind a tiny amount of sweat. And when the bullet's fired, the heat vaporizes the sweat. A chemical reaction with the metal etches the fingerprint permanently into the casing. Wow. Are you telling me you have a print? Well, a partial. But it should be enough to find a match, if your killer's in the system. Oh, got a hit. Monica Bards? Why are her prints even in the system? Oh, looks like... she got a "reckless driving" charge in 2010. Explains why she drives a golf cart. Well, I'm putting out a warrant for her arrest. But Rose telling Sloan to dump Henry only helped Monica. Why would she kill her? Well, maybe she did it for Henry, or with Henry? People do twisted things for love. I did not have it out for Rose. But Henry did. Did you kill her for him? No! And yet there's your print on the bullet. How do you explain that? I can't. Wait. Um, there was a day that Henry and I went to the range. I loaded his revolver for him. Henry said he didn't like guns. Because of me. Look, I know my way around a gun, but I had a brother who died in a hunting accident. After that, I told Henry to sell the revolver, and we never went back. So you're saying Henry sold a loaded gun to a pawn shop? There must've been a bullet accidentally left in the chamber. Look, I'm bringing Henry back in. Do you know where he is? He's teaching at a golf camp down in Oregon. Hmm. Okay, well, we have to bring him back here. Now. So, how was dinner with Luke? It's nice to see him again, I guess. You guess? I mean, I don't know. Kind of feels like old times. Like an old shoe, or like old high-school butterflies? He kept the engagement ring. Whoa! The one with the rubies? Yeah. Did he get down on his knees and propose? No. Uh, hang on. I'll be back in a minute. - 'Kay. Hey, Ruby. Hey. How's the teaching gig going? Really good. Oh, but I'm hoping to get something full-time. I'm sure it'll happen. Cool tattoo, by the way. Oh... just a silly high school thing. Oh, where'd you go? Taft. Our arch rivals. I know, right? Here I am, organizing a Patriot reunion. Anything to get into Principal Nardone's good books. How're things going with your ex? Ah, it's getting better. What about you? Have you seen yours? No, he's too busy with his wife. You know, expecting a baby, so. He's having a baby? Yeah! I think I saw it on social media somewhere. Um, I actually have to go check when the drinks are getting delivered. Excuse me. Okay. Henry and Monica said they haven't told anyone about the baby. How would Sloan know? That is weird. Mm. Unless she found a way to know everything about Henry's life when she got back from Singapore. When did she get back? She said a month ago. Mm. Let's check. Right... Mm-hmm. Her profile says that she stopped teaching at the Singapore school two months ago. And that's when her posts stopped as well. Maybe she came back earlier than she said she did? I noticed that tattoo on her arm. That's the "Karma" symbol. Sloan said her engagement photo was in the paper. See if it's still on her website. Mm-hmm. Weird. No tattoo. She told me she got it back in high school. Why would she lie about that? I don't know. Oh. Karma... Mm. Karma. I'm starting to wonder if Sloan wasn't as cool with her breakup with Henry as she's letting on. She's still single. She has no real job. She comes back, finds out that he's having a baby... and he's happier than he's ever been, but... I think you may be on to something. I wonder if she hikes? Or if she lives near Shannon Falls? She said she went to Taft High. That's close to the falls. Mm-hmm. Oh, she lived with her grandma. There is a "Mary Waller" in the area. Hmm. And we know the clues, they point to Henry. Oh, can you pull up the first clue? Mm-hmm. Do you see that? The date. It's not written American-style. "26-3-2020." The day is first. Singapore. Day first, month second. I think Sloan was trying to frame Henry. Hey, Ruby. Hey, could you look into something for me? Like, right away. What? Sloan said she came back from Singapore a month ago. Can you see if that's true, through her passport or something? Think she may have come home sooner. I can. Only if you tell me why. I don't think Monica's the killer. I mean, the motive, it just... it doesn't make sense to me, it never has. I have my own reservations, but we have evidence that's hard to refute. So what are you gonna do? We're gonna hold Monica for 48 hours, bring Henry back in, and wait for the D.A. to decide what she wants to do. Okay. One more thing. Are you free tonight, by any chance? I am. Would you be my date to the reunion? Uh... sure. Yeah. What-- What happened to the doctor? Oh, I'm not going with him. Meet me at Patriot High, 7:30? Sure. Well, hello, Beau. Derek Saylor. I see you left your varsity jacket at home tonight. I don't live in the past, like some people. Is the dance-off still happening? Oh, it's on. Okay. Ruby! Dakota. You look beautiful. Thanks. This is so great. The chance to meet Tommy's high school friends was too good to pass up. Oh, did Tommy tell you the time when he-- Sorry, Ruby. The statute of limitations on embarrassing stories ended after the 10-year reunion. Come on, let's dance. Ruby? Wow. You look breathtaking. You clean up well yourself, Doctor. Ruby, I gotta be honest with you. I have missed you immensely, and I just wanted to know what you thought about the possibility of us-- of giving us a second chance? We live a thousand miles apart. I-I know. But we could work it out. Can't we just dance tonight and have fun? Ruby, I honestly would love to, but the hospital called and I have a last-minute scheduled surgery in the morning. Yeah, of course, I understand. Ruby, we're great together. Okay? I don't want you to forget that. Ruby? Come see! I'll call you next week, okay? - Bye. - Bye. The winner and new champion-- Derek Saylor! Whoo! Hi. Gladys. You look good. It's all those Pilates I've been doing. Have you seen Sloan Waller? She's over there. Oh, great. Could you tell her that Principal Nardone wants to see her in his office? Of course, dear. Where is he? Ruby? What are you doing here? I have some questions I wanted to ask you. Can you believe it? Monica, a killer? I saw it on the news. She's no killer. What do you mean? Henry's the one who had a grudge against Rose. He's the one who should be behind bars. You think he killed her? Well, it's obvious he had motive. Because Rose convinced you to break up with him, and she took all your money that you two had saved up for a house? Exactly. Henry hated her. So is this about karma? Henry should pay for what he did? Yeah. Why did you tell me you got your karma tattoo in high school? I saw your engagement photo. No tattoo. I covered it up with makeup. I didn't realize you were so nosy. I think you know more about Rose Vitello's murder than you're letting on. I have my suspicions, but that's it. You said you knew about Henry's baby. There's no way you could've known that. I heard it somewhere. What does it matter? Henry told me that Monica was so much better for him. She was desperate. Pathetic. She never loved him the way I did. You tried to get him back, didn't you? But he rejected you and you blamed Rose. I don't like your tone. Back away. I followed your hunch, Ruby. Turns out Sloan was here for two months, not one. So, what, you gonna arrest me for coming home earlier than I said? And you've been staying at your grandmother's house, not too far from where we found the gun. Grandma Mary's, was it? I got a warrant for your old bank records. You were broke when you left for Singapore. Almost every penny you had went to Rose. Tell us what really happened, Sloan. Tell us. I realized Henry really was the right man for me... but it was too late. Said I never should've listened to Rose. So I thought that if I could get the money back for our house, I could fix it, so I went to see to Rose and I told her how she'd been wrong about Henry, and I begged her for our money back. She laughed at me! She never cared about me! I mean, she was a con artist. And I was angry, so I went back later, and pretended everything was okay, and asked for a reading, and... And you killed her with the revolver from the pawn shop. I trusted her! Why lead me to the gun? I thought it was a chance for Henry to get what he deserved. Is that thing on? Say "hello" to the class of 2005. Sloan Waller, you're under arrest for the murder of Rose Vitello. Oh. Uh, this is for you. Sorry I can't stay. After five years, the case of murdered psychic Rose Vitello has finally been solved with the help of our own Ruby Herring, who is here now for the exclusive story. Thanks, Linda. It all started with a note that was left on my doorstep, and it ended with an unexpected arrest this weekend. So, looks like exclusives are becoming your thing. With your help. So we found poetry all over Sloan's apartment. And that would explain the bizarre clues. And hidden in one of her books was the missing "death" card from the deck. Can't believe she kept it, like a souvenir or something. I think she thought it was all a game. One thing bothered me. How did she know about Henry's baby? Well, apparently, Henry wasn't watching your news segments. He still leaves his spare key in the same place from when he lived with Sloan. Under the flower pot. Sloan's been spying on Henry. She was obsessed with him and Monica. She was clearly watching me, too. Yeah. Creepy, huh? Thankfully, you, uh, outsmarted her. We outsmarted her, actually. Mm. So how was the rest of the reunion? You took getting being called to the principal's office to a whole new level. Not the same without you. Why were you so late, anyway? I had to find a flower shop that was still open, you know, for that corsage I got you. It was beautiful. Oh, hey. And I know it's last-minute, but I could use a partner in this golf tournament. Are you asking me to be your... partner? I need a ringer. So, "bye-bye, Luke"? On his way back to L.A. Yeah, saving lives in the California sun. What's the status of you two? He wants to give us another shot. Does Jake know about Luke? Yeah. But not that he wants us to get back together. Well, we're just friends, anyway. In fact, we are playing as a team in the golf tournament next weekend. Well, my advice for golf and dating is the same-- play with your head, but trust your heart. Mm-hmm? And steer clear of the rough spots. Thank you. Oh! Love it. Good morning. Morning! Wait. You didn't? A present from the pawn shop. Thank you. Play to win, right? True. Very true. Look at these. Gorgeous. You know, I have to ask you something, Did you take me to the reunion as back-up, or...? I mean, I knew it couldn't hurt having a savvy detective close by, in case things got ugly. Truth be told, I just wanted a ringer on my arm to make all the ladies jealous. Oh? Can I ask you something now? Sure. What's my favorite ice cream? Vanilla, right? You're not keeping your eye on the ball. Yeah, just a little distracted. Okay, try again. Loosen your grip. Head down. Wait. You giving me an order? Well, if you're gonna be on my team. Oh, it's your team now? Wasn't it always? Whoa!
