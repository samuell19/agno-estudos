With the horizon as a backdrop The wheel turns and turns again Our traveling wagon Brings the dream to human hearts Love wishes to hold on to it But without hope of succeeding Nothing can change its destiny When the soul Is far away Death is lurking Let's smash him Let's make him crazy Sir, come back up, I beg of you. What does it matter? Drop the stone. Sir, now is not the time to visit the tomb of your ancestors. The Sigognacs enjoy visits at all hours. Come back up, sir! Let the slab fall, I tell you. Let's get it over with. I prefer death to my dark ridiculous life. I beg you, sir. Come up! In order to please all three of you, the last Baron of Sigognac should starve happily. You have very dark thoughts, sir. Didn't you speak to her, sir? To whom? To Mademoiselle Yolande de Foix. We will not speak of her. Her name is withered in this household. Because you think she's too beautiful. -My hunting outfit. -That's the coat your father wore! -That's exactly my point. -It's a baron's coat. Yes, it's all I have left. Along with my pride and an empty stomach. I'm hungry! Don't you understand? You could visit the Marquis of Bruyères more often to ask him… -For money? -Oh, no. And dishonor my three storks? The sky is upset at the very thought of it. Sir! -Did you hear it this time, Pierre? -Yes, I did. Don't open it, sir! I'll let him in, even if it's Satan himself! It's the devil! Excuse me, noble lord, for knocking on the doors of your fortress myself without being announced by a page and his horn. Who are you? Matamore from a troupe of actors whose wagon got stuck near your strange manor. -What do you want? -Shelter for myself and my comrades. Gladly. You're a four-hour walk from the nearest inn. You'll be better here than outside. -Pierre, take care of these actors. -But they're heathens. Take care of them, Pierre. Come on, Miraut. Put the cattle in the shed. This way, my ladies. This isn't how I imagined actors to look. Just like we didn't imagine the castle to look like this. -Now, Zerbine. -It's like the catacombs! -Isabelle is the wettest. -She can take off her dress. -Surely not in front of you. -Good old Léandre. She's fed up with bats. Isabelle would rather see a chicken. I thought you had more decency, my dear Scapin. -He must be the steward. -The owner isn't home. He's the butler, Séraphine. Isabelle must be confused. I'm not surprised, Léandre. -Pardon me. -Thank you. Come on! Make yourself at home. -Help yourself to anything. -Thank you. Except, there isn't anything here. -Your generosity alone is worth-- -The most tender ortolan. And it's time for me to make a confession. We made some nice revenue yesterday in Bergerac. Thanks to me! I invite you all to supper. Well, let's get to work! -Pinch me. -Excuse me? -Pinch me discreetly. -Right now? Obviously. I can't eat if I think I'm dreaming. If the baron will excuse me, I'll go change the fork. -He's a baron, dear. -A baron? Monsieur Baron, sir. What an honor to be in such esteemed company. Sit down. You're in the home of the last Baron of Sigognac, but believe me, there's no reason to be silent. -I really like this marquis. -A prince! Don't stop yourselves from eating just because I'm here. I'll show you how. Butter for your pâté? A little piece? -Would you like some of this treat? -Yes, please, my dear. If you don't want another treat, I won't mind taking it off your hands. Sorry, but treats are for women. Léandre! Does your mustache feel better? Yes, Isabelle. It will tickle your cheek. -The next time we perform. -Oh, Léandre. This isn't a theater prop. -Over here. -No, over here. If my heart spoke, Lysander A nice speech it would make to you Because for you There is no such thing as tender He would not be swept away… Now, all Isabelle has to do is behave. Or misbehave! She's seducing the baron, because she plays naive roles. Her roles aren't naive, she is. -Naive? -Yes. Hey, you! With a smile From the shepherdess to the shepherd… To your love. But I don't love anyone. For Yolande de Foix. "The Violet and Love": Modest in my color Modest in my stay Full of ambition I hide under the grass But if on your brow I can see myself one day The humblest flower Will be the most superb Isabelle. Theater is food for the eyes. You really like that one. We all love a coarse woman. We would suffocate here. If you only knew… The road, the little villages at night, the poor huddled people who come to warm their hearts. They forget everything when they're in a dream world with us. Because we sell dreams. Sweet dreams for a cheap price. Yes, riches often take away misery, but also freedom. And space. Alone, we cry. Together, we chat. -In groups, we sing. -Sing? I would never say that a gentleman wastes his youth dancing the ballet of spiders. Isn't Paris tempting? Yes, but I don't have any money. If you can't take on the position, at least accept a spot in our humble wagon. -What? In your wagon? -Of course. For Isabelle. Isabelle, my soul feels lit up By this flame that forces us to love Let us go happily to the garden While our young spring endures -Were you looking for me? -No, Mademoiselle, I was… Oh, her. She's delightful. But a bit inexperienced for a man of your rank. -Inexperienced? -It's a figure of speech. Because she and Léandre… -Are married? -Oh, no. -Are lovers? -I didn't say anything. Isabelle. If you only knew… The road, the little villages at night, and the freedom. Alone, we cry. Together, we chat. In groups, we sing. Here, we'll only find brambles and nettles. It was you who made this flower bloom, like poetry among the ruins. Excuse me. Come with us, Monsieur de Sigognac. We'll leave you in Paris to make your fortune. And be a burden to you? Never. I've heard that you write verse very well. Our poet has left, so you can replace him. I am known to have a way with words, but… I struggle with comedy. You could make it more tasteful. Come! -Now you're poking fun at me. -Very well. -I'll leave you to your owls. -No, Isabelle… -You think he's going to come? -I hope he comes. Because it will show our radiant Séraphine that there's another pretty woman in the troupe. -Robbers! -No, they're falcon hunting, look. I'm the terror of the universe! Friend of the Camargue! So you've decided? You're coming with us? I haven't said yes yet, Isabelle. Look! Falconry is so beautiful. -Let's go back to the castle. -The Castle of Misery? No, thanks. Look! You look like you're hiding. I'm not hiding, but-- -You don't like hunting? -That's not what I was saying. I'm the terror of the universe! Friend of la Camargue! Wherever I go, they put up crosses! Vidalenc, look at that beanpole in this wagon full of freaks. -They're mad. -It's getting worse. There are two or three decent troupes left in Paris. But in the country, they're either immoral or thieves, flung into poverty by their uncivilized job. More often than not, they're stolen children who become thieves. Are you going to let them say that? How disrespectful! My friends are good people, -and you're… -Clumsy. Excuse us. You are delightful, Mademoiselle. -Vallombreuse, where are you? -Over here, Yolande, by the old wall. Good lord, Cousin, I never thought I'd find you in such romantic company. My lord, we're losing our hunt. Go on and take the last one. It's going to seem cowardly now to tell you I can't come with… The stolen children turned thieves. Of course not. -Isabelle… -It's Yolande de Foix, isn't it? Farewell, than. Isabelle. I'm going to try one last thing. Listen. Isabelle, my soul Feels lit up By this soft flame That forces us to love… -My song. -That's Séraphine's voice. Maybe, but it's Isabelle's heart. Let us go to the garden So that our young spring May endure Saddle my horse, would you, Bayard? -Are you leaving? -Am I leaving! No, I'm not leaving. She forgot her scarf. -So saddle my horse, Bayard. -Very well, sir. Here he is. -Did you already have him saddled? -Yes, I had already guessed. To live our life Without fear of desire Let us take pleasure -He's leaving the castle. -Really? Yes! May God guide Your Lordship where it pleases him. Goodbye, Pierre. Isabelle, you've won! Who says he's coming for Isabelle? Nobody, of course, but it sure seems like it. Will they ever leave me in peace? Full of laughter and drama He happily comes To offer every soul The step it was waiting for Whence Séraphine, Isabelle Léandre, Harlequin Give wings to take flight From this petty world With the horizon as a backdrop The wheel turns and turns again Our traveling wagon Brings the dream to human hearts You're poking me! Silly Fagotin. Every time he sees a toad, he turns the wagon upside down. Just wait for it to drop. Does my costume surprise you, Monsieur Baron? Léonarde plays the king in our repertoire. And I, the queen. These are the verses I wrote this morning. "'The Violet and Love'. Modest in my color Modest in my stay Full of ambition I hide under the grass" "But if on your brow I can see myself one day The humblest flower Will become the most superb" You know it? Tell me, is it that your inspiration never changes, or that your muses change too often? Manifestly. But these are spare verses from the past. It's too bad we don't have a show tonight. Why is that? I wouldn't have minded your embrace. Welcome to theater, my friend. Blazius, Tabarin, Molière. There are three troupes in France of our quality. Between us, ours isn't the most famous. -Our young lead stutters. -Thank you. -Our know-it-all is always drunk. -Me, drunk? Hérode is ridiculous and Matamore is gloomy. Except me. As for Isabelle, she's young… A little too meek, you know? Whereas I'm the Queen of Hearts. It's getting dark. Let's try to get there before dark, Fagotin. I've already slaughtered ten men tonight. The guns, Fagotin! You know they're just theater props. Stay in the wagon. This is my business. We're armed and ready for business. I just saw the travelers. If you decapitate the lady, will you give me her necklace? It will depend on the job. OK, to your posts! They won't find our doubloons here. -Who knows? -I think you want them to. Rebellion is useless. Make the slightest move, and my troupe will shoot. To my stork! -Are you going to let him fight alone? -No, of course not. Handsome bandit! Stay here to protect the women. -I'll protect them. -Thank you. Don't leave us! Come out, my angel. We earn our living with more realistic tricks than yours. It's too bad to interrupt such a nice career. It's not all roses. It's a very popular job. -God, I was so afraid. -You didn't need to be. Believe me, I wasn't afraid for myself. You deserve to be hanged for frightening these women. But they've pardoned you. -Here, take your bread and butter. -Thank you. Forgive me if I've mistreated your troupe of scarecrows. -Let me have it, Madame. -You're ruining the job. Give it back. The wild one is pretty. -Here, I'll give you mine. -You're giving it to me? I'll never kill you. Ladies, girls, and gentlemen. Tonight, the great actors of the traveling troupe that has performed for royalty are here to perform their gala show in Monsieur Grigoli's barn, alongside calves, cows, and other horned beasts. -Blazius, have you seen my hair? -No. Holy cow! Let me help you! The show's going to be a turkey. The sun is rising, and so is Harlequin's cape. When my whole front is derailed… The stars shatter. As good of a painter as he is a poet! -Yes, I think that… -It's a set for Isabelle. The springtime. -I didn't know that you were… -You poor guy. It's true that men really are brutes… -Were you looking for her? -Oh, no. -OK, then. -Is she up there? I don't know if I should tell you. Let's take advantage of these few minutes alone, my dear. Leave me be, Léandre. It's not right. What torture it is to live side by side, in a lie, speaking secretly, feigning indifference in front of everyone else. Léandre, my love, someone's going to catch us! -My love… -Yes, my love? No, that's not right. It's like you've never been in love! My love… It's the best love scene in the show and you're ruining it. I'm ruining it? You idiot. You've been acting weird lately. Ever since we've had a guest. -Any chance you're in love? -Me? Let's keep going. My love… -It's a bird. -A bird? Ever seen a bird? It's fake. In theater, everything's fake. Don't you know? Everything's fake. And now, Isabelle the Naive. Help! -My dear, are you hurt? -No. But my cousin is shaken up. -I'm fine! -Make yourself at home. -Idiot! -My lord, the mandolin… These drivers are idiots! Don't insult my people, you oaf. As for you… Who is this spineless man? Oh, my dear Duke! My dear Marquis! -What a state we're in right now! -Allow me. Have the farmer give my cousin a glass of Arquebuse. Marquis, that was you! -Our door is stuck, sir. -This way, Madame. -OK. -This way. -My God. -Are you hurt? No, I'm just a bit dizzy. We need a chair, some cordial, and a fan! -It's nothing. -You'll be good as new soon. You're rather indulgent, my duke, to not be irritated by this accident. It's horrible here. You are going to be, after two hours with the geese and ducks. Oh, no. I really like this village. -What a charming inn. -Your Lordship is very kind. This place isn't so far gone. They were expecting us. They're rehearsing a play. It's our little angel! Excuse me, Madame. May I be of service? Thank you, my child. I knew that shepherdesses were in style, Duke. But I didn't know that gypsies were vying for their place. You're usually more witty, Yolande. I'll have to beg this young lady to forget your impolite remarks. I've heard that you will be performing in Poitiers. I'll be waiting and I'll bring the entire village. I want all of our citizens to know what true beauty looks like. And now I know what true rudeness looks like. Now I will come with you. See you very soon! You must be a great lord in this area. Yes. Actually… no. I'm… the lover. -The lover? -In the show. In the show! Yes, but I'd love to be in real life too. How interesting! I must admit that… I'm sorry. Is the Marquis around? No. I must admit that everything you do excites me. Oh, the theater. I must admit that everything you do excites me. The Marquess. Wait here a minute. My dear, it's a disgrace. The wheelwright says it'll take three hours to repair. That seems normal. The oaf says it may take four, five, or even six hours. As I understand it. I just wanted to prepare you. We may have to spend the night here with these performers. I'm ready for anything, Ulysse. In the meantime, I'm going for a walk. Of course. What a dream it would be to have you as a maid in real life. I like swapping roles in real life. What a marvelous idea! Let me do the same. -What do you mean? -Let me be your servant, Zerbine. For an hour, the evening, or the whole night? Why put a limit on our performance? Because before accepting a role, we like to know how long it will last. It'll last as long as the show. A single performance? You're the writer, so I forbid you to believe that. You must be so talented. Oh, the theater! But, it's… Oh, my cousin, what are you doing here? I was just passing by. Oh? Uh… an accident as well? Exactly, an accident. Well I hope that your accident isn't the same as mine. Don't worry! The baron despises maids. Let's hope that your accident lasts as long as his. Isn't she naughty! We'll try to follow in your footsteps. Remember the play I told you about. -No roles to learn. -Because I'll be in charge of the action? -Entirely. -OK, I'll start. We're going to go up in the loft, Monsieur Marquis. My makeup is up there. Oh, the theater! The theater, my dear! Life behind the scenes is quite cramped. All the more unexpected. May I be your respectful guide? I don't plan on being respected. Look what you made me say. I'm so infatuated. Up there is where… Up there is where… but it's a stable. -You're my Wise Man. -Your Wise Man? Yes. As you wish. We'll be very comfortable. -I wouldn't dare. -Then close your eyes. Let me guide you. Come with me. Oh, my Wise Man. My God, where am I going? -Come on. -OK. Really, now that's insane. Oh, now! My God. My friend, do something. This inn is very uncomfortable. There are beams everywhere, and you ruin your pantaloons. Léandre, where are you? You're on. Excuse me, duty calls. Zerbine! Duty calls. Don't forget that. The wheelwright, my dear. I'll go. Yes, you go see the wheelwright, my love. Which one of you is the troupe's cashier? -Me, Your Lordship. -Here. This will cover tonight's revenue. I don't know if I should, Your Lordship. You're about to lose one of your stars from the arrangements we've made. Who, Léonarde? Oh, no. Hush! PARKING PROHIBITED FOR TRAVELERS AND PERFORMERS Look, "Travelers prohibited." We can't stay here. Have a nice show! With our turmoil as a backdrop The wheel turns and turns again Doubt is the lure of defeat Tomorrow, tomorrow Will be a celebration The mournful old wagon Sobs for its death Still dreaming of serving its purpose Love And beauty Await The good Lord is going to pluck his geese. My dears, we're almost there. Yes, in three leagues. Isabelle's most beautiful feature is her eyes. Yes, and her smile. Yes, her smile. And the way she wears her hair. -No woman can compare. -Of all the women I've known… Matamore! Wherever I go, they put up crosses! We can't go any further. We'll camp here. Get the canvas for the tent. Scapin, make us a fire. Cover the wagon. Keep the women inside, out of the wind. -Take my coat, Matamore. -Thank you. Get some rest. Come inside, Séraphine. Let's go, Matamore. There's bread and ham. Fagotin. All of our theater props. He can't die duringThe Trojans. Better keep him from dying tonight. I'll get some straw. -Léandre! -This way. Here's some straw. Get some rest. I have something serious to tell you. Hush, Matamore, we have plenty of time. I feel very bad. Sooner or later, even Bayard will be left behind along the way. Read these letters. They're about Isabelle's birth. -Her birth? -I got them from her mother, Cornélie. Isabelle is of noble birth. Just like you. -You're delirious, Matamore. -No, feverish. Not delirious. Why are you telling me now? Because I didn't want to bring her closer to you. -You loved her that much. -Love her until death. Promise me she'll never find out. Besides, nothing matters anymore tonight. -Nothing. -Matamore. Listen. The crows are waiting for me. If I failed at life, let me succeed at death. -Blazius, Scapin! -No, it's too late. Let's make it quick. Here is my will. I leave you my role. Wind and thunder! That's… That's my role. The revenue… Without me, the troupe would starve. Do it for her. You'll be a good replacement. Your heart is the same. But you need the eyes. Listen. I don't do frightening halfway. I could kill Isabelle through my enemy. Monsieur de Sigognac! Go on. Go, I feel good. The fire is good for me. I'm resting. May death take over! Who wants to fight here? Death with haggard eyes? I'm going to murder you with just one look. The enemy is stronger. The ridicule… In your frozen shroud, you see? I surrender. Matamore! This way! Come see Matamore! Fagotin, go get the shovels and the spring backdrop. What? You want to bury him here? Church cemeteries are closed to us performers. So we make the best of what we have. Requiescat in pace. Didn't he have a secret in his life? No, Isabelle. Go before you all get sick. Come on, Blazius. I don't feel well. Before the day Of our fleeting time Is in tyranny Of the shadows of night Let's take time To live our lives Without the fear of desire Let's spread Joy Isabelle. -May I examine this locket? -With pleasure. It's very interesting. It looks like a unicorn. It's half a coat of arms. And the other half? My mother must have lost it. Did you know your father? No, I was too young. Why? What would you say if you found out that you were of nobility? You're trying to hurt me, Mr Baron. One must have noble blood to catch your interest. We actors are doing just fine. If I were you, I'd make sure to never lose this locket. I'm very attached to it. Zerbine has come back! Oh yes, Zerbine is here! Glad to see you back. There you are, you know! Séraphine, this package is for you. I had to bring you something, since I brought gifts for everyone. -You should have… -Brought us something to eat. I came prepared! Let him through while I talk to our troupe treasurer. This… These aren't theater doubloons. I tasted enough of the Marquis to get a lot of it. I kept him company. I followed your tracks. And here I am! I present to you our new Matamore. Blood and fire! No, I don't see anyone. Forward we march. My whole body shivers. I hear them. Let's run! The wind passed over him. With the favor of the shadows of the night. -Matamore was never that funny. -It's true. -You're a born comedian. -You need a name! My name… is The Captain. Captain… Smash! Here's your official suitor. Beware of the gentleman! -Am I close enough to you now? -Oh, Monsieur Baron. Monsieur Smash. At 2 p.m. at the governor's palace, Lygdamon and Lydiasby Sieur Scudéry. Then, Pierre Corneille's masterpiece, L'Illusion Comique. Five chivalrous acts with the divine Isabelle and the mysterious Captain Smash. -I told the Duke of Vallombreuse. -Keep it down. His name is hated in this country. He's invincible by sword. He takes women, then kills their husbands or fiancés by duel. I've been told he has more than 100 victims to his name. Oh, my God. So, are you interested? Yes or no? Because he's madly in love with Isabelle and he asked me… I don't believe that Isabelle is a mortal woman. She's a god disguised as a woman to delight our souls by ear and by the eyes. How poetic! I'm very pleased with myself. I've been wondering if you hadn't gone mad. What do you mean? Treat yourself to that columbine, but lose the silly sighs of love. I love this columbine. No, you love Yolande because you're smart. I must be dumber than you thought because… So you've given up Yolande? I haven't given her up, but I'm not thinking about our wedding. -Because of that actress we met? -Yes, because of her. And it's because of her that you've destroyed your love letters, your locks of hair, and the dried flowers you held so dear? Yes. It's odd, but that's the way it is. I don't even recognize myself. I don't believe that Isabelle is a mortal woman. And why is the old lady making us wait? -She's been here for a while. -Then let her in! I can't wait any longer. Ah. So? All of Your Lordship's orders have been carried out. -That's perfect. Hold out your hand. -Thank you, Your Lordship. What did she say when she received the box? I must confess that I thought I was doing the right thing -by placing it on the table. -What? But I am sure that the sweet girl is already adorned with her magnificent jewels. Why these precautions, old witch? It seemed wiser. Because someone would be upset by my gifts to Isabelle? As you can imagine, no one will dare stand in the way of the Duke of Vallombreuse. Thank you, Your Lordship. -You didn't answer the question. -He's a passionate suitor. -A gentleman from the village? -An actor from our troupe. As long as he's not a gentleman! Yet he calls himself a baron. Your story doesn't make sense. That's what I told Séraphine. A good thrashing will do for this impostor. There you go. Tell Isabelle we're coming soon. Hurry, my little ones! Fagotin, the candles. -I'm on it. -Good. -Paltoquet! -Cocu! Keep the riffraff out, but let in those who can pay with goods. OK. Sedan chairs and horses are bumping into one another. -Can I let them in? -Yes. Set the backdrop! The nobles are coming from every corner. The entire village is outside. Lords and Ladies. Hurry up, my dear. -Yes, I'm ready. -You can sing later. Your Lordship. -Pardon me. -What was that? Pardon me. How are your children? -What are you doing up there, you fool? -I'm repainting the spring backdrop. Repaint the moon while you're at it. You're not going to use my hair as a beard. -Give me that. -My beard! Let's go. What are you up to, you old owl? Nothing of your concern, old wine bag! Wine bag… Zerbine! The show is about to start. It has already begun! Your Lordship! But what if someone catches us? My God! -Marquess. -Yes. -The Marquis. -Oh, my God! -My hat, my horns! -Get out of here. -My respects. -Madame Marquess. My love. Thank you, Marquis! Monsieur Marquis. Mademoiselle. I was looking at the sets. Dramatic art should be encouraged. The paint was still wet. You brushed up against it. -Let me get that, dear. -Thank you. Let me help you! You cannot refuse to see the Duke of Vallombreuse. -It would be scandalous. -No! -It's tradition. -Come on. All of Poitiers is with him. Have you seen the revenue? Fine, but he can have his jewelry back. No! -You there. -Monsieur Duke. What an honor. I finally get to see you again, Mademoiselle. Oh, excuse me. Sir, may I first ask that you take back your jewelry? I'm just a poor actress. I don't deserve… Never. If you don't like it, give it to your friends or the poor. Not another word about it. It is, on the contrary, so unworthy of you. Please continue. Happy are the poets who entrust their verses to such beautiful lips. -And the verses even more so. -Oh, that's… Show starts in five minutes! They're calling me. -Will you let me finish up? -Please do, Mademoiselle. We'd be very happy to watch you finish up. Ah, yes. You've forgotten your beauty mark. -Allow me to put it near your breast. -Sir! -It'll look very natural. -Leave me be. Monsieur de Vallombreuse! The lady can put on her own beauty marks. She doesn't need anyone's help. Very funny! I'll have my lackeys break your bones. Beware, they're pretty strong. I only take beatings onstage, Monsieur de Vallombreuse. You won't have the honor of being beaten by me. That we shall see. Perhaps, with less pride, I'll beat you with my own hands? Leave me, I will not talk to a mask. The gendarmes will take care of it. My people! Marquis, would you tell this man that a Sigognac was already a baron and led 100 lancers in the First Crusade in the company of your grandfather, while his was only a squire. Duke, what Baron of Sigognac said is true. What kind of joke is this, Cousin? This mask? It marries respect for my ancestors with the necessities of the role, Cousin. Save your words, Bruyères. Vidalenc! Please choose the weapons and location with the Marquis. The beautiful Isabelle will crown the winner like in days of chivalry. Why make her wait? Fagotin, my stork. It's 2 p.m., I'm not on until tonight. We have plenty of time, unless my costume offends you. Not at all. But I'll feel bad depriving Poitiers of such a natural Matamore. We'll see which of us warrants the name. Come now, Vidalenc! Come laugh with me at this extravagant adventure. My God, go prepare yourselves, my children. Hurry up. Come on. My friends, we have a duel! The Duke of Vallombreuse provoked an actor. -Which actor? -Captain Smash. Hush, here comes the Duke. Don't fight for me. Fight for you? You must be joking. We don't fight for women, but to defend their honor. And yours is… How shall I put it? Yours is… too expensive… or far too cheap. Zerbine, I'm lost. He hates me. He didn't even listen. Fetch a doctor, Léonarde! My God, what is it? Oh, Isabelle! Royal ordinance: Anyone convicted of having fought in a duel will have their head cut off by the king and by his order. Richelieu, Secretary of State A cemetery, Duke? We're looking for the vulture. It's to save you the trip back. I'm not in the mood to miss my entrance. You'll have it in heaven, a bit prematurely. Bells? Impressive. A happy twist of fate allows you to listen to your own death knell. The thought of death puts me at ease, sir. You've had how many victims? Seventy-three. Why hurry? We have plenty of time. I'm afraid I'm late for my funeral. Prince of street performers, you are shameless. Who are you talking to? To my stork! Ah, it's the name of your… Yes, it's the name of my… We were talking… About your coma. You'd be better suited with a wooden sword. Your wish is my command, sir. Wind and thunder! A duke, fighting a… Comedian! You rank us just below dogs. Let me boost your esteem. How are you going to do it? By rhyming. So, you'll be acting the whole time. Of course. And with this stiletto soaked in your blood, I'm going to give you a very nice butt. You amuse me. Easy. I retract my statement. I underestimated you, Baron Gitano. -Who taught you? -My friend, Cyrano. Brilliant, I must admit. For your next lesson, a secret from Girolamo de Padua. He kills without dwelling on time immemorial. Did you also want to skewer the birds? Tragic minstrel! You want the whip instead? The only thing left… Is to fight with daggers. Choose your grave. This one here? Or this one? This is no longer a duel. It's a murder. Evidently you hold a grudge against the trees, sir. Clown! To the death! Ready! Your hands are mottled. -Thunder. -No, Duke, that's Captain Smash's phrase. I'll let you in on one of my own secrets. Captain Smash! On the count of ten, I'll kill you. But I'll give you one last chance, while I slowly torture you. -The basics. -Yes, the basics. I'll start! One: I improvise. Two: I fake right and open the line. Three: You attack. Four: I turn the wrist and end up in sixte, which is step number five. Six: I move my hand to prime. Cheater. Seven: You wish my fencing lesson would end. Eight: I move this hand to quarte while releasing the weapon. Ready to sign your will, Duke? Nine: I push it all the way in and the stork brushes against you. Ten: His silver wing breaks your shoulder. Well done, but now I can beat this game. It's so unlikely, that I'll bid you adieu. -Braggart. -You don't believe me? You're from Gascony. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven… -It's Yolande de Foix. -Beautiful jewelry. -She's lovely. -But not practical. She's the future Duchess of Vallombreuse. Lyse, have you seen him? What did fate decide? Do you bring me news of his life or his death? Only in you do I place my last hopes. What do you hope to receive from your frivolous pain? Do you think to weep and tarnish your charms, to remind your lover of the gates of death? Consider instead making an illustrious conquest. It's just Vallombreuse. A ready soul. An incomparable man. Zerbine, the Duke is alone. Oh, my God. He killed him. I guess the duel went well for you. Better than I suspected at one point. Everyone is looking for you and here you are. I swear that the Duke is very worried. When we no longer have hope, we no longer fear. I find it easy here to make my complaint. Here I saw Clindor for the last time. This place reminds me of the accents of his voice. And brings back to my distraught soul the loving memory of such a dear sight. Come on, don't be shy. Take my place. -Shower her with your graces. -Yolande. He's dead! How alarmed you are! Do not refuse me the safety of your charm. Monster of nature, heinous executioner! After the cowardly blow that digs my tomb, pronouncing your judgment, it's of me they've disposed. I wish to follow you in death, since I am the cause. And the same moment will know two deaths. Our loving spirits will join one another again. Captain Smash… Where is he? My God, he's going to miss his act. I don't do frightening halfway… -I could kill my mistress… -I could kill my mistress through my enemy. I'll never remember it. Go through those doors! I don't do frightening halfway. I could kill my mistress with my enemy. -You'll pay for this. -As much as you'd like. It's decided, Scapin, I'm going back to my land. Of my sobs of love, she will have known nothing. I will have passed by her, lonely, clutching my dead dream. My entire heart is lost. No, you've won. I succumb to your pain. In the April of my eyes, I see an entire man bloom. I surrender myself completely to the arms you hold out and love nothing about me that is not yours. In exchange, my delighted soul can offer nothing but life. My blood is the only possession I have left to my name. I'll gladly lose it to serve your beautiful eyes. Bravo! -Are you hurt? -It's nothing. Did you do it? Yes, but it's not fit for a gentleman. Do you want me to be ridiculed in front of the village and the girl? But it's illegal. -I already told them to invade the stage. -What? Separated from her captain, the girl will be less shy. A loving memory of my dear delights, that will soon be transformed into infamous torture. That, in spite of the horrors of its mortal fear, your charming conversations are to me so dear. Isabelle… Since the indulgents refuse to serve me, let's see how loyal the gallows are. -The gallows? -Yes. Ah, Malartic. Come here. You know where you came from. I can send you back. My Lordship, my dagger is yours. You can no longer run away, your time is up. What a joy, at the end of my life. I die for having served you. And no matter the blows I suffer, I die a glorious death, because I die for you. It's the gallows for us. If you want to save your friend, do what I say immediately. Monsieur Provost! A murderer's order seals my fate. Unable to hurt me, he chooses to assassinate. His name is a nuisance to me, like a flea on my arm. A thousand new enemies are born under my feet. Finally, with my courage I must commit a crime, and give the felon my head as his victim! I fear even the shortest of springs, I'll die from the blow that ends its days. And so I must lose you. The same place I received your heart, I'll receive your adieu. -Meet me in the alley. -Everything is fine. We must go. The horses are ready. Soon you will be able to laugh at the stops. To my stork! Don't worry, we won't steal her away. Yolande! Go through the fields. Take the road to Paris at midnight. It's the crossroad two leagues away. -How can I thank you? -By being happy. -What about our friends? -They'll catch up with you. Goodbye! Are you looking for someone? To your horses! Use the deer's path. Come, Malartic. The surgeon has finished. Basque, my box. Just leave me alone! Money for you and your gang. I have no power, since they are no longer in my province. But on the road to Paris, if you succeed… How many cutthroats were there against Cyrano? -Ninety-three my Lord. -Wimps! -I was not. -We need 100 against Sigognac. But… -Promise me his head. -Deprofundis, Your Lordship. 40 on the embankment, 20 at the gallows. 15 by me and 25 on reserve. There's our leader. 100 to 1, do you want a gun? No, Merindol. It'd be impossible to load in this wind. OK, put that away. We'll start with swords. -If he escapes, get the horses. -Yes, sir. We're starting with swords, loyal to tradition. Noblemen are executed, not murdered. Put away your guns. This way, Commander. Agostin, who are we going to kill? I have absolutely no idea, but it pays well. And hope for some action. A man who upsets so many people… Oh, what a dream. To your places. Don't harm the girl or the Duke won't pay. Spare the women and actors. Gang up on Sigognac! Stop, it's not them. Father. Excuse me, Father. Did you happen to see a wagon of actors on your way? Yes, at the Villeneuve crossroads. -They took the road to Nevers. -Thank you, Father. Look! Wind and thunder! Lightning and cannonade! Everyone ready! I tell you, my dears, I have already slaughtered ten men. Stop, my Lords. Since you seem to like theater, my friends and I will perform for you. I'll give you the choice of three or four deaths. I can shatter you like glass with one jab, and bury you alive deep underground. I'll split you in ten with one swipe of my sword. Enough kidding around. Attack! Come back, now! -Where is Isabelle? -She's over there. Scoundrels, dirty beasts! Isabelle! Sigogn… Léandre, they're coming! Hérode, Blazius, get ready. We're going to pull forward and get away. Fagotin is waving. Come on, Léonarde. I'm not upset about leaving them. Idiots! The wagon has disappeared. You're fighting yourselves. To my stork! Keep going. Get us to safety! Let me go! Sigognac, help! Let me go! Look at you Agostin. One elegant act is worth another, Captain. I've got you now, you scoundrel! Sigognac! To your horses, gentlemen. The game is won! -Isabelle was kidnapped. -What? -In a carriage. -Going where? Vallombreuse Castle. Your Lordship! Isabelle lost this during the fight. Your Lordship, take the shortcut. There they are! Save me! Take her to the tower room. I was unsuccessful, Monsieur Duke. -And Sigognac is in the park. -Imbecile! In the park, did you say? We'll send the story of our first night of love to him with a crossbow. Have your men ready. -Would you like to get dressed? -No. Tell your master that I won't accept anything from him. What is this unicorn? They are the arms of the Prince, father to the Duke. The Duke? Is he responsible for my presence here? I cannot answer you. If my presence is unbearable to you, Mademoiselle, and if you need time to get used to your new home, then I shall retire. You are my prisoner, but I am your slave. Ambush, kidnapping, prison… Golden. -That's it. -That will be it. If I wrap your hate with love. If you want me to forget your villainous ways, give me back my freedom now. Don't count on it, Mademoiselle. I tried to forget you, Mademoiselle, but I need your presence like a plant needs light. It's dark when you are not here. If what I did was a crime, I must use it to my advantage. For alas I see, you do not wish to forgive me. How long will you keep me? Until you become my wife. There's no hope of that. So be it. I'll be content with reality. Don't come any closer! Help! Scream all you'd like. One would have to fall from the sky to get in here. -She's mine! -Roland! I don't murder, I smash! -Defend yourself! -Take this woman. Roland is mine! -She's mine! -Not yet. I block, I strike. She's mine! She's mine, OK? Stop the fighting! This duel must end. It must, I beg of you! Vallombreuse, stop! Smash! Get back! Come quickly. I'm afraid your knight in shining armor is in bad shape. I want her to look closely. Watch your lover die. Oh, my God. -Look at him. -No! Kill me instead. My life for his. I beg of you. -I'll do whatever you like. -Will you be mine? -I promise. -Do you swear? Yes. Quick, get my surgeon! There's hope. No! Isa… Isabelle. Isabelle. While Sigognac is between life and death, I'd like to remind you of your commitment. I remember it with horror. You're a monster to me. You swore, so you must pay. -No, I don't want to! -Don't yell like that. The injured will hear you. Unfortunately, even if he heard me, he couldn't help. No! Leave me alone! Isabelle, open the door for me. Open up! Vallombreuse. You're Isabelle's brother. Have you gone mad? Where did you get this coat of arms? Here is the portrait of Isabelle's father. My father! Isabelle! Isabelle, open up! He killed him. Don't wait for him to break down the door. Open this door! Isabelle! Isabelle! Basque, Dubois! -She must have gone out the window! -Yes, that's it. The two girls fled through the window. The one by the tree. Go find them! Sigognac. My friend. I'll bring her back. Why the costume, Pierre? Costume? The great Sigognac livery? I don't recognize you anymore. You've become the greatest Prince of Gascony. Our good king has showered you with money and honor. Yet you remain insensitive and sorrowful. -It came too late. -We'll rebuild the castle. Hire ten or twenty servants! No, Pierre, nothing matters anymore. Sir, you'll find her one day. No, life isn't an act in some play. Pierre, fetch me my stork. Don't go, sir. There's a storm and fog in the valley. Go get my sword. This isn't how I imagined actors looked. Just like we didn't imagine the castle to look like this. -Your generosity alone is worth… -The most tender ortolan. We made a nice revenue yesterday in Bergerac. Thanks to me. I invite you all to supper. What an honor to be in such esteemed company. Goodbye, Stork. -Did you hear knocking? -No, sir. To my stork! Excuse me, noble lord, for knocking on the doors of your fortress myself without being announced by a page and his horn. Matamore, my friend… Have you come for me? I knew my time had come. I'm ready. I will follow you. I am not a messenger of death. I'm a messenger of life. Pierre. Our friends have come for me too. The silence. They're ghosts. Isabelle. If you only knew how happy we are! Isabelle. Isabelle, you're alive. Yes, my love. You're also alive. Praise the Lord. But how, Isabelle? I have the rest of my life to tell you about it. It's better than the theater. Pierre, you lied to me. I wasn't dreaming. Blazius and I planned everything. Isabelle. My love is here. Monsieur de Sigognac. Chiquita! What are you doing here? Agostin! We needed a Matamore. And an Isabelle. The wedding bells are ringing. The baron is waiting in the park. What are you doing? Let's go, kid. Everything is ready. We decided to leave in secret so we wouldn't lose heart. The wine is too good here. Our waists are getting thicker. We have too much. This can't be our life. Come on. Let's go! If we wait for both weddings, we'll never leave. Right, Zerbine? We'll give them one last wave from the top of the hill. -Are you leaving too, Zerbine? -Of course. Between theater and life, I've made my choice. Now quickly, my children. I'll give you the choice of… Of what? Of three or four deaths. I'll shatter you like glass with one jab, and bury you alive deep underground. THE END
