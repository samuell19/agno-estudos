Our little winner. Hello, Mr Muir. Good to meet you. This is Traci, my daughter. Alright. Well, let's get started, shall we? Ah, sweetheart, look after little...little Traci for me, will you? I'll be back soon, OK? Can I get you a cocktail? Thank you, but I don't drink. Is that a religious thing or a diet? I know how you ladies like to look your best. Come on, sit down. Thank you. So you really flew all the way from Australia all by yourself, no husband? No, not anymore. What did he do, did he forget your birthday? I have always wanted to come to America. My parents are performers back in Australia. Is that so? I believe if you want to make it as a singer, America is where you need to be. Oh, it's the only place to be, sweetheart. And, of course, the opportunity to record an album with Mercury. That. OK, yep. So, there's not going to be an album. What? Well, there wasn't a recording contract. You won an audition for the recording contract. I have to audition? OK, so when do I audition? No, no, no. You already did. Bandstand sent us your tape. Miss Reddy, you sing, you sing very nicely, OK, but male groups are all the rage right now. You've heard of the Beatles, right? See, we couldn't get you airplay. All the radio stations already have an allotted spot on their playlist for the female record so I can't do anything with a female singer. ♪ I will follow him ♪ Follow him wherever he may go ♪ There isn't an ocean too deep ♪ A mountain so high it can keep, keep me away ♪ Away from my love ♪ And where he goes I'll follow I'll follow, I'll follow ♪ I know I'll always love him ♪ I'll love him I'll love him... ♪ Yeah, you want something? I'm being paid less than the band. So they're men. They got families to feed. Well, I've got a family to feed. Look, lady, I'm helping you out by turning a blind eye to the fact you ain't even legal here. You want to complain about equal pay? Find another gig or take it up with the nice folks down at immigration. Mummy! Hi, darling. Thanks for looking after Traci. I'll try and help out when I can. Thanks. Taxi! Excuse me, I'm looking for Lillian Roxon. Yeah, yeah, she's over there. Um, Lillian? Hello, darling. Oh, welcome, welcome! Where are you staying? Hotel Albert. Oh, you poor thing! It's a terrible dump, isn't it? The worst. But the price is right. Well, I hear the Easybeats are headed to town soon so you might be in good company. Well, I'm sure they'll be welcomed with open arms. The record company I was meant to sign with backed out of the deal. Male groups are all the rage now. Darling, how ludicrous! Do they honestly think all people want to hear are rip-offs of the Beatles ad nauseum? I mean, boy guitarists notwithstanding, I don't think I can stand the sight of another bloody electric guitar. Maybe there's a story in that. So you write about music too? I mean, when I can but it's mostly housekeeping, beauty tips, fashion. But it's really music that's changing everything. It drives me crazy 'cause those blokes don't even take rock and roll seriously. I mean, they don't get it's a call to arms, that it connects with us and speaks to us in a way that music has never done before. So they can laugh all they want. Meanwhile, I'm going to be the one to write about it. I'm going to be front and centre of the revolution. Then they can write about you. Yes! What about you, Helen? Do you write songs? - I'd like to do more writing. - Well, you should. I bet you've got plenty to say. Now, have you been to Max's yet? Max's? Who's Max? Oh, darling! It's time we welcomed you to New York properly. Ooh, so what about him? We're just talking sex, right? Oh, God, yes! I can't abide this whole dating culture the Americans are obsessed with. They're so bloody timid when it comes to sex. He looks like an actor. No actors, that's my rule. Musicians are out too. God, who does that leave? OK, wait, I'll just check the list. OK. We've got musician, bartender, bum... You actually keep a list? Yeah, I write about everything. What? You know, I was terrified to call you. I thought you'd be another brittle, phoney New Yorker ready to eat me for breakfast. I was dreading meeting you. But I think you and I are gonna get along just fine. Hey, Traci! Traci! I said we have to keep the door closed, remember? And it is really time for you to go to bed now. Mummy, tell me the story about when you were a little girl. Well, I was only a year older than you when my daddy decided it was my turn to perform in his stage show. But you forgot the pink bow. That's right. I had a pink bow in my hair. I stepped on the stage and the light was so bright, the brightest light I'd ever seen. Were you scared? A little bit but all those people in the audience were there to hear me sing and I couldn't let them down because my daddy taught me... The show must go on. That's when I knew that when I grew up I was going to be a singer. Lillian, do you think this is asking too much of Traci? Do you want to play in my room? You are a good mother, OK? You'll know if it's too much. I'm not sure I do. I mean, this is how I grew up. Our life wasn't exactly normal but, you know, I thought it was and that everyone was in showbusiness. Well, lucky you. I grew up in Brisbane. Showbusiness meant you owned a television. I still have my return ticket to Sydney so I was thinking that maybe I go home a while, save up and then come back to New York. No. You and I both know you won't. Look, you want to know what I think? I think that one day Traci's going to be grateful that you stayed. She had a mother that taught her it's OK to follow her dreams. That, or she'll never be able to look at a can of spaghetti again. Well, my mother writes to me every week and tells me I have to choose between career and marriage. I tell her we can have both. Does that mean things are getting serious with Stevie? Oh, hardly. I mean, they're not called the Easybeats for nothing! But I do have another project. An encyclopaedia. Of rock and roll. Oh, Lillian, that's incredible! Or crazy! No-one's ever done it before, probably for good reason. I mean, what if I get as far as the Bee Gees and realise that all I'm good for is beauty tips. That's definitely not true. From now on, no-one will tell us what we can and can't do. Mummy. You'll write your encyclopaedia and I'll...I'll get a recording contract. Oh, so does this mean you're not going anywhere? You and me against the world. Oh, she's here! I threw you a party. Lillian, you didn't have to do this. Oh, isn't it fabulous? Here, let's grab this. You're charging people. - Well, it's your rent fund. - It's mortifying! Oh, what's more mortifying, being able to pay your rent or going back to Australia with your tail between your legs? I've never seen him before. And he also didn't pay. I can take care of this. No, that's OK. This one's on me. Oh, is it? Hello. I'm Helen. Oh, you must be the birthday girl. I am. And I have absolutely no idea who you are. Hm, that's all about to change. I'm Jeff Wald, manager, work for the William Morris Agency. You heard of us? We're big players. Nope. Well, I used to run my own show with Oscar Brown Jr. He's a star of the jazz world but you probably haven't heard of him because most people don't know much about jazz. Of course I know Oscar Brown Jr. All Blues, originally Miles Davis, twelve-bar blues in seventh chords. You, er, you know Miles Davis too? Well, do I need to teach you about jazz? Well, that's why I'm at William Morris, to learn, see how the game is really played. I got big plans. So have I. Bigger, even. - Oh, yeah? - Mm. I'm gonna make $1 million by the time I'm 30. Well, I'm gonna make $2 million. But good for you to keep it modest. Oh, shit. You're from Australia, right? What are you doing in New York? - I'm a singer. - Mm. You've heard it all before, right? Really? No. Trust me, I'm different. I'll tell you what. Why don't we go somewhere a bit quieter? I've got some killer weed. Weed is marijuana. Yes. I know that. We have it in Australia. Well, I can't stay late. I have a 3-year-old daughter. Great. I love kids. Alright, you can hang those out. Traci, who is it? I don't know. I told you not to open the door. Oh! Sorry. Um... - Hi. - Hi. How did you find me? I... I'm really connected in this town. No, I remembered you said you were at the Hotel Albert and I just asked at the front desk. - Alright, well, come in. - Yeah? Sorry about the mess. Oh, that's alright. I was just in the area. Can I get you something? Tea or...spaghetti? No, that's OK, yeah, I'm good, I'm good. - Did you bring chess? - Yes, I brought chess. Right. Checkmate. I guess that means we win. I guess that means congratulations. Thank you. Are you leaving? Yeah. I've got some stuff I've gotta do. Thanks for the game, though. Traci, it was good to meet you. Well, onwards and upwards. I mean, let's face it, you can only go up. Well, I have revised my dating rules. No actors, musicians or men bearing chess sets. - Tell me about Stevie. - No! ♪ There are those, I am sure who have told you ♪ They would give you the world for a toy ♪ All I have are these arms to enfold you ♪ And a love time can never destroy ♪ And if you're wondering what I'm asking in return, dear ♪ You'll be glad to know that my demands are small ♪ Say it's me that you'll adore for now and ever more ♪ That's all... ♪ You won. I won? After last time, I went to the library and studied up. You make me want to be better. Oh, my God! Oh, it's Jeff! Oh, I read your article on the San Francisco music scene. Oh? Oh, come - I read. Come on, don't look so surprised. Grateful Dead, right? I'm gonna check 'em out. Well, well. Music does have charms to soothe a savage beast. - Lillian! - OK, I'll be back. I'll be back. Do you want to go with them? People-watching's more my style. Yeah? You watching me? I'm not sure I can afford to take my eyes off you. That's the way I am. No-one ever got what they want standing around waiting for it. Is that what they teach you in the Bronx? My ma did. She was pretty tough. What about your dad? He died when I was a kid. - Jeff, I'm... I'm so sorry. - I don't know any different. Alright, peanut butter and jelly. Oh, look at that! - Jam. - Jelly. - It's jam. - It's jelly. - Traci, what is it? - Jam. - Jam. See? Two against one. - Traitor. Bona fide American food. And the only thing I can cook. Does it taste good? The best food I've ever had. How about that?! - That's pretty good. - That is good. She's a great kid. Smart kid. Like her mom. Sorry - mum. I bet you say that to all the single mums. Sorry - moms. What are you laughing at? You're supposed to be eating your food! She's finally asleep. Let me be your manager. - What? - Shhh! Shhh. I've just been thinking. We could do this. You and me together. A team. You'll be the show, I'll be the business. Come on. I'll make you a star. Or maybe I'll make you one. Maybe. - Oh, Jesus! - What? A fucking cockroach! Traci's started naming them. I think that one might've been called Mr Ed. Right. My first managerial decision is you move out of this dump. Oh, right. And where exactly am I moving to? Los Angeles? Well, Jeff thinks LA will be better for my career. Well, what about Jeff's job? Jeff doesn't have one anymore. William Morris fired him for selling pot out of the mailroom. OK, so your boyfriend, your unemployed boyfriend, is gonna be your manager? Helen, are you sure about this? All I know is I'm going nowhere fast in New York and... ..yes, Jeff's my boyfriend but I'm willing to take that risk for someone who finally believes in me. I believe in you. I'm just really going to miss you, is all. Well, I'm going to miss you too. Look, I'll admit Laurel Canyon is the place to be right now so your manager might actually have a point but is that the kind of singer you are? What do YOU want, Helen? ♪ I'm a daughter I'm a sister ♪ I'm a lover and I'm a muse ♪ But I am strong and I am gentle ♪ I am wise and I am true ♪ Here comes the revolution ♪ Voices clear Voices loud... ♪ ♪ Gimme Some Lovin' ♪ Hey! ♪ Well, my temperature's rising ♪ And my feet hit the floor ♪ Twenty people knocking 'cause they're wanting some more ♪ Let me in, baby I don't know what you got ♪ But you better take it easy 'cause this place is hot ♪ And I'm so glad you made it ♪ So glad you made it ♪ You got to gimme some lovin'... ♪ - We'll take it. - Well, that's swell. We'll just need four months' rent in advance. Four months' rent in advance? That's all the money we have. I'll have to book every spaghetti house and dive bar in LA and you'll have to start managing the bloody Beatles! Oh, come on! You gotta spend money to make money. Don't you see how LA works? It's all about image. Nobody wants to be managed by a bum. Look, we get this house, we get married for real, I get myself set up and then we launch your career. OK? Come on. Come on. Yes! Yes, yes! I love you! Yes! I love you! Hi. Reservation for Wald. Certainly, Mr Wald. Hey, how much longer are we gonna have to wait? Our reservation was for half an hour ago. These people you seated just got here. As soon as your table's available we'll seat you, sir. - Let's just go somewhere else. - No, I want to eat here. Mr Goldman. Nice to see you. Mike. Mike! Hi. How are you? Good to see you. Jeff Wald, manager. I'd love to get together and talk about some stuff I've been working on, big stuff. - Sure. Call my office. - Great, thanks! Sure thing. I've lost Jefferson Airplane. - Did you try looking up? - Oh, ha! I trod on the bloody Beach Boys again. I swear this encyclopaedia is taking over my entire apartment. Not to mention my entire life. And it's wreaking havoc on my asthma. How's LA? Have you gone blind from the glare of all those disgustingly healthy tans yet? Well, I can still see the Hollywood sign from our window if I dislocate my neck. - No! - Dreams really do come true. Have you got a gig yet? Oh, Jeff's trying but, you know, he's very busy. He actually just got a job with a new management company. He's managing...Tiny Tim. Tiny Tim? Oh, God! Lillian, I miss you. I'm so bored. I miss you too. I was just telling Linda the other day, actually. Who's Linda? Oh, she's this American photographer I've become friends with. Actually, she's coming over soon. She's dragging me to this party tonight 'cause she's decided she's head over heels in love with Paul McCartney! Then we're going to see this divine singer I've discovered, David Bowie. Don't you love how Englishmen can look effete but aren't? Oh, coming! Oh. Oh! Are you still there? Yes. Well, that's Linda, so I've got to dash but word is that Betty Friedan and the National Organization for Women are stepping up the Equal Rights Amendment campaign. They're going to call on all women to strike. I'll report back, OK? Lots of love, darling. Morning, sweetheart. How are you? - Good, Dad. - Good. Hey, Traci, why don't you go and get ready? OK, Mum. We've got to be in the car in about ten minutes, alright? Love that home cooking. Has there been any word on that gig at the Troubadour yet? I would've told you if there was, wouldn't I? It's like eating cardboard. Have you chased them up? How many times do I have to tell you? I'm busy. Not a minute's rest from that douchebag Tiny fucking Tiny Tim, Deep Purple are about to start touring but, hey, why don't I just drop everything and call them again? I was thinking about going to college. I'd love to study psychology. I've always been interested in what makes people tick. That's great, Helen. Maybe they'll have a course on how to buy milk. You know, you could go to the store for once. Buying milk is not just my responsibility. It is! It is your responsibility. I'm working to put the milk on the table, you gotta go buy the milk. What are you doing? What do you do all day? This place is a fucking pigsty and all you do is bitch and moan about getting a gig and talk bullshit about how people tick. Who the fuck cares?! I didn't sign up to be some little housewife to wait on you hand and foot. You told me that this house was a stepping stone to my career. Traci, we've got to go. I didn't realise my new career would be cleaning the bloody thing. Here. How about that? - How's that for inspiration? - Jeff. Figure out what makes me tick. Clean this shit up. There's shit everywhere. This is the hardest piece I have ever had to write in my life. I am supposed to be telling what happened when 25,000 women marched down Fifth Avenue last night on the 50th anniversary of the day women won the right to vote. As is customary in my business, I am supposed to be telling it briskly and without bias. Fat chance! I am so biased I can hardly think straight. If the idea of change makes you uncomfortable, don't worry. You're not alone. All of us ladies agree this time that getting there will be half the fun. But being there is going to be an important part of a brave new world. A song called Black Night. Get on there! Aaaaaah! Hey! Is the volume loud enough? - Yeah. - Right, good. ♪ Black night is not right ♪ I don't feel so bright ♪ I don't care to sit tight ♪ Maybe I'll find on the way... ♪ Hey, no groupies back here. Do I look like a fucking groupie? ♪ Free to be me ♪ Black night... ♪ Hey. I need to talk to you. What the fuck are you doing here? - I need to talk to you now. - Now? - Yes. - Are you serious? Hey, guys, take five. You sound great. Hey, you are embarrassing me in front of my clients. Your clients?! Well, what about your other client? Me? You know, we made a deal. And all your talk of, "Hey, baby, I'll make you a star. "You're the show, I'm the business." It's bullshit. You know how it works. It's all about timing. You're just afraid to do any real work. You start doing this job you keep telling me you're so good at so I can start doing mine. I've called everyone in town. Nobody wants you. Nobody. You're wholesome, you know, you're...you're a housewife, Helen, let's face it. And that music, that's what people want. You're wrong. There is a whole lot of 'me's out there and we don't want to listen to that. Did it ever occur to you men to ask women what they want to listen to? What do you want me to do? Capitol Records. Hi, this is Jeff Wald for Artie Mogull. Just a moment, Mr Wald. Great, thanks, sweetheart. Don't call her sweetheart. It's demeaning. - I can hang up this phone! - Jeff! - Artie! - Good to hear from you. - How you doing? - You too, buddy. I'm good. Ah, Artie, it's your lucky day 'cause I got the next big thing for you. She's a star in the making who can not only sing but dance, act - this woman can do it all. Helen Reddy. Isn't that your wife? Yes, it's my fucking wife. Why do you think I married her? 'Cause she's so fucking talented. Look, I'm sure your wife can sing very nicely. She's not what we're looking for. Artie, the '70s is the decade of the solo artist. You got James Taylor, Carole King, Helen Reddy. She's Australian too. How about that? Yeah, I'm not sure that's a selling point, Jeff. Artie, just... You gotta listen to her, please. Do me a favour. She's gonna blow you out of the water, I promise you that. I'm sorry, Jeff. Helen, she's just not for us, OK? But, hey, let's grab lunch soon. You call my girl and put something in the books. - Alright, thanks, Artie. - Sure, no problem. Bye. I'm sorry, honey. I tried. Is that what you'd say to Deep Purple? What do you want me to do? I can't... I can't make him want to see you. What are you doing? No, hey! Alright, alright, alright. Capitol Records. Hi, this is Jeff Wald for Artie Mogull. Just let me check if he's free. OK, thanks. I'm sorry, he's on the other line. Well, I'll hold. It might take a while, Mr Wald. OK. Well, just tell him I called, then. - Will do. - Alright, thanks. Bye. Look, I left word for Artie, he'll call me back, I'll set up some dinner here and you can sing for him then. - No, no, no, no, no. - It'll be great. - What? Come on. - You're not leaving this room. Get out of the way, come on. What are you doing? Capitol Records. HI, sweet- Hi. This is Jeff Wald again for Artie Mogull. - I'm... It's really urgent. - Sorry, he's in a meeting. Capitol Records. Hi. Jeff Wald for Artie Mogull. I'm sorry, Mr Wald, he's still in the same meeting. Same meeting, huh? Capitol Records. Hi. It's Jeff. Mr Wald, I'm sorry, he's still in a meeting. He'll be unavailable all day. All day? Hi, Kim, it's Jeff... Stop tying up my phone line, Wald! I haven't had a single call all day that wasn't you. Artie, listen. You need to hear this. You've got to trust me. Trust me. I know talent when I see it and Helen has got it in spades. You know me! Just think it over. I'll call you tomorrow and the next day and the next day... - Alright, alright. - ..and I won't stop. If I let her record a single promise to never call again? Yes! Yes. I will never call your ass again. Thank you so much. I owe you! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Fucking yes! Whooo! - Oh, I knew you could do it. - Me too. Alright, I did my job. Now you better do yours.

Oh, my gosh. OK. Don't look at me or I'll laugh. You got it. Don't say 'mate'. Hello, I'd like to request a song, please. My favourite song. I Don't Know How To Love Him by Helen Reddy. Yes, it's my new favourite song. I can't get enough of it. - I love it! - Thank you. - Jeff! - Jeff. - Can I have a turn? - You bet, baby. Here. Is that the radio DJ, Lillian Roxon? Oh, my God, it's Helen 'Number 13' Reddy! - Hello. - I've missed you. I'm so thrilled you came. Oh, let me get this. You know me, dropping stuff everywhere, as always. - How was the flight? - Oh, it was great. I knew you could do it. The very first encyclopaedia of rock and roll, written by a woman. You'd think I'd be ecstatic but I wrote an encyclopaedia. Where do I go from here? Helen, are you home? Turns out that piece of shit promoter hasn't been promoting the single so I went into Capitol and pissed all over his desk. Hi. Just another boring day at the office. - How are you doing? - Hello. - Good to see you. - You too. You know, every day I await new tales of chaos and carnage. I'd say urine is a first, though. You two comedians done? What's this? Finally finished the encyclopaedia. - Congratulations. - Oh, thank you. Wow. It's huge. Need more pictures. - You'll never read it. - I'll never read this. Hey! - Seven! - Hey! - Eight! - Hey! Alright, great work, everybody. Hi, darling. Hey. Did you have fun? I don't want to do kung-fu anymore. But why? You were so excited. Girls at school are teasing me. Honey, it doesn't matter what those girls say. Boys don't like it when I beat them. Can't I just do ballet like the other girls? Please? - Traci, you were fabulous! - Wasn't she? You were so good! This one's ridiculous. "It makes no difference if you're rich or poor, "smart or dumb, "a woman's place in this world is under some man's thumb." Please tell me that's ironic. It gets better. It goes on to say that when you're a woman you're born to be lied to, cheated on and treated like dirt. But, "When your man comes home "you're glad it happened that way "because to be his woman, no price is too great to pay." Meanwhile, Capitol want me to record the highest-ranking songs already on the charts. Oh, bugger that. That's exactly what I said. I want my own songs. Well, go with your instincts. You're the artist. And you can never trust anyone in a suit. Are we still talking about Capitol? Just don't ever let anyone tell you you can't do it without them. Killing Me Softly. What? - Let me take that. - Oh, it's fine. - Come on. - OK. - Hey, Lillian. - Yeah? Would you write my album liner notes? I know no-one really bothers with liner notes anymore. Helen, of course. You and me against the world, remember? Thank you. At least now there'll be something on this album I can be proud of. Helen Reddy. Songs to remind you you're only a woman. Gotta go. - Love you. - Love you. Lillian. I feel like you've only just got here. I'll see you soon. Call me when you get in. I will. Bye. ♪ I am woman Hear me roar ♪ In numbers too big to ignore ♪ And I know too much to go back and pretend ♪ Well, I've heard it all before ♪ And I've been down there on the floor - ♪ And no-one's ever... ♪ - Turn it off. It's kind of angry. Well, it's empowering. It's a celebration of what it means to be a woman. It's man-hating. I don't hate men. I'm married to one. Jeff, you OK with this? I'm OK with this. Wait till all this campaigning leads to unisex toilets. - See how she feels then. The DJs will never touch it. - They hate women's libbers. - What is that word anyway? I believe in equality. Look, what my wife, Helen, is trying to say is that she's tapped in to something here. Remember that march in New York and how many women showed up? Imagine that as record sales. A bunch of record sales marching down the street. I still think it sounds angry. Come on, Artie. There's no such thing as bad publicity. Yeah, but I don't know about this one. Well, let's just bury it on the album. No-one will listen to the whole thing anyway. Well, that's true. What are you doing? Ready to go? What the hell was that? Maybe Artie's right. You do sound kind of angry. This is important, Jeff. This is more than just a song to me. So trust me. We're gonna pretend to play their game but we're going to get I Am Woman out there, you and me, whatever it takes. What, we call the radio stations again? Yes, but this time it's not us calling. Alright, then, who is? Women. Based on their excitement at finding it buried on the album? No. We book you in every venue and club and you are going to sing I Am Woman and the women are going to love it. Yes. Alright. You see those two? Easy target. It's those ones. It's the wives out on the town you gotta get. I can do it.

And the winner is... The winner is Helen Reddy for I Am Woman. Thank you. I only have ten seconds so I'd like to thank everyone concerned at Capitol Records, I would like to thank Jeff Wald because he makes my success possible and I would like to thank God because she makes everything possible. Over here! Fuck you! Fuck you very much. Thank you. Appreciate it. That's Helen Reddy. Good evening, Mr Wald, Miss Reddy. Hey, Jeff, Jeff Wald. Helen, I'm a big fan. My wife won't stop playing your record. Are you interested in movies, Helen? Abso-fucking-lutely, she is. Call my office, we'll set something up. Get these fellas a bottle of your best champagne. - Dinner's on us. - Jeff, he's the greatest. You're the man! Isn't he? Enjoy your evening. Wasn't that a tad extravagant? Baby, you just bought a house in cash. Champagne and a couple of entrees is pocket change. Besides, we're celebrating. Well, speaking of celebrating, one of the first women in America. No 'Mrs', no nothing, just my very own name. Way to go, baby. Drinks are on you. Don't be ridiculous. I'm not using it. We pay cash, like always. - Complimentary hors d'oeuvres. - Thanks. I was thinking about inviting Lillian to fly out. I'd like her to be the first to see the house. Hey, did you read Lillian's article on Paul and Linda's TV special? - No. - She is vicious. "Did you see them in that pub scene? "Paul's congenial as all get-out. "Linda's catatonic with horror "at having to mingle with ordinary people. "Linda comes across "as an incredibly cold and arrogant figure, "coming to life only when the TV cameras are focused on her." - Ooh. - Jesus. You watch what you tell Lillian, right? What do you mean? I mean, you're careful about what you say to her? After reading that, I sure as shit wouldn't cross her. Lillian doesn't believe in reporting gossip. She would never betray my confidence. Yeah, I know she's your friend but at the end of the day Lillian's ambitious and she's not going to let anything stand in the way of her and a story. Let's just agree to disagree, OK? Wouldn't be the first time. Helen Reddy is with us tonight, she's a superb singer, and, as you know, she starred in her own summer television series and is well on her way to become I think the first artist besides the Beatles as a group who had three number one records in a single year. She's going to do a couple of numbers for us and one of them is her latest big hit called Leave Me Alone. Would you welcome, please, Miss Helen Reddy? ♪ Big old ruby red dress Wanders 'round the town ♪ Talkin' to herself now Sometimes sittin' down ♪ Don't you get too close now ♪ Ruby runs away ♪ Poor old ruby red dress Born on a sorry day ♪ I can hear her say ♪ Leave me alone Won't you leave me alone? ♪ Please leave me alone now Leave me alone ♪ Oh, leave me alone Please leave me alone... ♪ And that's a cut. Excuse me, Helen, I need your signature on this. Hey, I'll sign for that. Oh, that's alright, he signs everything for me. Lillian Roxon called for you again. Yes, I'll call her back. Can you make sure the announcer knows to start the show with "Good evening, everyone," - not "Ladies and gentlemen"? - Sure. What do you think of Alice Cooper dubbing you "the queen of housewife rock"? I love it. Alice is just fabulous. Is it true you don't wear a bra on television? Would you ask a man if he wears underwear? We've got to wrap this up. Now the Equal Rights Amendment is only eight states short of the required majority to change our Constitution, what do you think of conservative political activist Phyllis Schlafly calling on women to fight against ERA and her claims it will disadvantage housewives and take away the privileges of womanhood? I disagree. I happen to believe it's high time the Bill of Rights be applied equally to women. Why wouldn't we want a constitution against sex discrimination? Alright. We're good, right? And, Jeff, a few questions for you? Alright. How does it feel to be Mr Helen Reddy? It's pretty good, actually. But to have a wife who's written the unofficial anthem of the women's movement and is the breadwinner in your home, isn't that emasculating? Well, Jeff and I are a team. We're equals. You know, it's not my career, it's our career. I'm here now because of Jeff. So he tells me. Jeff hasn't got a modest bone in his body but that's what makes him sexy. So a final question, Helen. When is a woman liberated? You mean when is a person liberated? When they're no longer discriminated against by the society. Hey, look around you. She looks pretty fucking liberated to me. We done now? Can you please drop me off here? What are you, a tourist? We're on a schedule. What if I forgo my next bathroom break? I assume we're scheduling those now too? I'm getting out. Like hell you are. What's wrong with you? Can you stop, please? If you stop, I'll kill you. Keep going. Hey, listen to me, both of you. I'm getting out. Now. If that's the way you're gonna be, I'm getting out. - Pull over. - Jeff, stop it! Move out of my way. Stop it! It's just the drugs. - Look... - Get back in the car! Look at me! I can get out of the car too, whenever I want. Well, I guess we're both getting out. Lillian, what's wrong? You don't look well. I...I stopped dieting. It was making me miserable and I was fighting a losing battle with the cortisone so I figured I might as well become a blimp and be done with it. Has your asthma got worse? I'm sick of taking drugs but I've no choice, and... ..the smog isn't helping either and with the newspaper, the radio show and the... ..and the magazines, I feel like I'm perpetually two steps behind myself. Oh, I know that feeling. These are beautiful. The gorgeous David Bowie. He heard I was sick. I guess not everyone forgets about you. What's that supposed to mean? You haven't been returning my calls. Never figured you to be one to forget your friends when you're famous. I've been busy too, the tour, the TV show, the kids. I read your review of Linda's show. What's Linda got to do with anything? Well, I was surprised. I thought Linda was supposed to be your friend. Yeah, well, so did I. Then she became Mrs Paul McCartney and... ..I didn't seem to... ..to matter much anymore. But I thought you didn't believe in making it personal. It wasn't personal. I report the truth and the truth is the show was terrible. I can be a little caustic sometimes, is all. A little?! Lillian, you were pretty tough. Why are you defending Linda? That's why you haven't been returning my phone calls. You thought that I would write about you? How could you think that about me? Well, I have a family. You know, I have to be careful, for their sake. I want my private life to stay private. Oh, is that right, Miss Helen Reddy, international superstar? And how many houses do you have, huh? And cars? Have you bought a jet yet or is that for the next Grammy win? Way to keep it private. You can't have it both ways, Helen. I have to go. Of course. Run back to Jeff like always. Helen Reddy, striking another blow for feminism. These are for the show tomorrow night. I hope you can make it.

Illinois is one state where supporters are using extreme tactics in an effort to pass the measure in the few weeks remaining. Throw away ERA, throw away ERA! In Illinois, ERA's been up ten times and lost ten times. ERA's most prominent opponent, Phyllis Schlafly, said she'd never have to return to Springfield. Well, Schlafly's back. Women found out what it will do. They found out that ERA will take away rights of women, such as women's exemption from the military draft. They also found out ERA will give more power to the Federal Government. Opponents of ERA also charged that it would legalise prostitution and homosexual marriages and it would require unisex bathrooms and destroy families. - God, she's ridiculous. - 35 states have... You sold out again last night? - Hmm? - Vegas. Oh, yes. Both shows, the 8 o'clock and midnight. Honey, I don't know how you do it. I was tucked up in bed five minutes after Dallas. I've gotten used to it now. Homework? I'm writing a story. Oh, I'd love to read it But only if you want me to. This is good, Jordan. It's really good. I think I'd like to be a writer when I grow up. Well, then, that's what you should do. And don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Morning, sweetheart. I'm not gonna be home for dinner. I've got graduation rehearsals then Lucas and I are gonna grab a bite afterwards. Traci's got a boyfriend, Traci's got a boyfriend. What have I said about teasing your sister before breakfast? I caught Traci practising her graduation speech - in the mirror. - Jordan, shut up. Traci, you're giving a speech? That's wonderful! Why didn't you tell me? Because graduation isn't in Vegas. Helen. I'm Kevin. Where's Joe? Ah, I'm looking after the album release now. This is so exciting. I'm a big, big fan. Well, I've been touring non-stop these past few years, plus the Vegas season so I'm looking forward to getting back into the studio again. We are really excited to hear that. You are one of MCA's most-valuable artists - and we are so... - Excited. Yes. Thank you. I'm thinking about going back to my roots and doing a jazz album. We should probably wait for Jeff, shouldn't we, if we're going to start talking business? Well, Jeff isn't here, is he? And I'm the one recording the album so I'd like to start... - Hey! - Jeff! There he is. Kevin, what's going on? You're looking huge! Been working out? Hey, congratulations on Rocky III. I hear it was green lit. Man, Sylvester's knocking them out of the ballpark! You a Rocky fan? Are you serious? Who doesn't love Rocky?! Come on! Shall we get down to business? I was just saying we have a bunch of ideas - for the new album. - Great. I was saying to Kevin I want to do a jazz album. The problem is jazz is kinda niche and after the last album sales we need to be cautious. Whatever you guys think, Kevin. I know we're in good hands at MCA. I'm not doing it. OK, she's not doing it. Come on, Helen. These guys know what they're talking about. What, are you serious? She'll do it. - She won't. - Yes, she will. - No, she... - Yes, she will! Get the fuck out of here, Kevin. What the hell are you doing? You want to lose your recording contract? No, what I want is your support. I support you! What are you talking about? You never used to care what the record label said. You think I care about a fucking record label? You think I'm scared of a record label? Come on, Helen. Jeff. I miss the way things used to be. And I... I miss you. The kids miss you. I haven't seen you... I've got a question. Who you been talking to behind my back? Who you been talking to about this jazz shit? I haven't been talking to anybody. You think you can find somebody better than me? - Jeff, stop it! - You don't need me anymore? I'm the best fucking manager there is in this town, OK? You can't find anybody better than me. Just calm down. It's just the drugs, you're paranoid. Oh come on, Jesus Christ, what are you talking about? You gonna start with this shit again? I don't have a drug problem, Helen.

For now, the ERA is dead. The person who fought most publicly for its defeat is Phyllis Schlafly, the head of Eagle Forum and Stop ERA. What is it exactly that you're celebrating? We're celebrating a great victory in defeating the Equal Rights Amendment. The polls have consistently shown majority support for ERA. - The polls... - Let me just finish. Isn't this really a victory for a vocal minority? Mrs Schlafly, is ERA dead? Really dead? ERA died three years ago when it ran out of time. Mom! Mom! - Mom! - Hello, darling. Hello. Mom! Are you OK? I'm fine. Absolutely fine. When are you coming home? I'm very sorry, Ms Reddy, we're unable to fill this until your account is paid. What do you mean, it hasn't been paid? That's ridiculous. It's been overdue for some time now. We sent several notices but we haven't received... Jerry, it's Helen. I'm at the drugstore and they're telling me that our account is overdue. My credit card's not working either. What's going on? I'm Jeff's accountant. I work for him. If you have any questions, you need to ask him. - What? I finally get up there, I find the room's trashed, bed's broken, hair clogging up the drain, TV disconnected. So I tracked him down... Oh, ladies and gentlemen, Helen Reddy in the flesh! What the fuck? Helen! Helen! Hel- Unpaid school fees. We owe money on the last tour. Jeff. there's loans out against our life insurance. I know, I know, this fucking new business manager, he put all this money in these offshore investments and he fucked us. I didn't want to tell you because I've been trying to put it right. Is there anything left? Look at me! We still have the house, right? Oh, my God. The accountant took out a double mortgage because we've got to pay back the loans and then there's the taxes. Jeff. What have you done? I haven't done anything! It's not my fault! It's the fuckin' business manager. I don't want to hear it! YOU were supposed to be taking care of business. I mean, Jeff, we have lost our home, our children's home... We've lost everything, Jeff! I can't do everything, Helen! Look, I know I fell asleep at the wheel and I should've kept a better eye on things but I promise you that's all gonna change. - Stop it! - Just stop. You got the Vegas shows, you're gonna do the new album. I'll go clean, I'll go sober. I'll fuckin' never touch the stuff again. I'm begging you. Please. Look. I can turn this thing around, Helen. Please, we can do this, we can do this together. Me and you. Just... Please, baby. We're a team. We're not a team, Jeff. - We are. - We're not. No! We're not anymore. I can't do this anymore. What did you say to me? After all that I fucking did for you? After all that we've been through together you're gonna fucking leave me like this? I made you a fucking star! No-one would even know who you were if it wasn't for me. Well, no-one would know you if it wasn't for me. No, no, no, no. Helen, you leave and I will fucking destroy you. I will fucking destroy you. I will take your career, the kids, I'll take it all. Don't you dare bring the kids into this. I can do it, Helen, you know I can do it, easy as fucking pie. This is Jeff Wald you're talking to. Everybody picks up the phone for me. For fucking me! Not you. Not Helen fucking Reddy. Are you kidding me? What, you've got a fucking problem? You're the one with the problem. - What the fuck, Helen! - Grow up, Jeff! Great! That's fucking great! That's fucking great. You fucking dropped the coke everywhere! Fuck! Mom? Jordan. Jordan!

They're organising a rally, Mobilize for Women's Rights, and they want to know if you'll perform. You told them I don't sing anymore? Of course I told them. They asked if you'd make an exception, just one performance for a cause you believe in. Aren't there plenty of young female singers out there who'd love to be part of it? - Mom, they want you. - No, they want the old Helen. And that was another lifetime. What happened to "The show must go on"? Traci, please. Look, I've made my choice and I can't go back. "Helen Reddy is a certain sort of woman "who is remarkably without artifice." Please, Traci. I know you gave everything away but I thought it might be time to revisit this. Helen Reddy is a certain sort of woman who is remarkably without artifice and remarkably without fear, who is made uncomfortable by polite lies, who refuses to face the world any way but straight on. And once she discovered there was nothing to hold back or disguise, shone so brightly people find themselves blinking when they first meet her. Like so many others of my generation and perhaps yours too, I saw lies and I wanted truths. I didn't even know who I was till music told me. I thought I was alone until I heard the other voices. Helen's voice was one of those. I used to read Lillian's liner notes over and over again when I was a little girl because they told me everything about the woman I wanted to be. Sorry. You've made me cry. Alright. Where is this rally? - It's in Washington. - Washington? Of course it's in Washington. I really love you. I love you too, Mom. You don't think I'm... You don't think I'm making a mistake, do you? You're going to be great. And the people say, "We believe in choice. "We believe in liberty. "And we will never be denied." We say to the political leadership of this country and to the Supreme Court and particularly to the President, "We will not go back." Whoooo! Our next guest is particularly special to me. When I heard her song it changed my life, as I know it did for many of you so it gives me great pleasure to introduce the woman who gave our movement an anthem, who gave us a voice - Helen Reddy! I'm so proud of you. Thank you.
