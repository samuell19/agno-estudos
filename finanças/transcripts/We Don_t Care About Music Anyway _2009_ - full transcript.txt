WE DON'T CARE ABOUT MUSIC ANYWAY TOKIO 20?? D.C. Conformity is defined by social consensus. Specially here, in Japan. It's hard to explain. Our acts are dictated by this hypocritical norm, that represses the will to change. As far as I'm concerned, this situation is very frustrating, and I'm convinced that there are many alternatives and more attractive possibilities. I believe too that my role is to look for them. This might be too abstract. Of course not Yamakawa. Now we now why your hair grows so much. It's true that the japanese have a poor notion of happiness. Exactly! Happiness in a box. Work, build your house, Go to the supermarket do your shopping. It's a set path. That's the definition of happiness here. It's been like this for a long time. We are led to believe in this form of happiness only. Personally, I believe that's foolish. Everyone has to find their own kind of happiness. Until the sixties, thanks to economic growth, this way seamed feasible. Current generations can't expect the same. It can't be expected for economy to improve. Under these circumstances, it's normal to do what you want. When you choose to be a musician, you choose a lifestyle. In our bodies there are two different zones: one that we can control, and another we cannot. The zone that we can consciously control is called the central nervous system. Inversely, there are zones in our body, that we can't consciously control. Our heartbeat, for example. This unconscious territory is the autonomous nervous system. I use a breathing technique to control the rhythm of my heartbeat. The notable thing about the respiratory system is that, besides being controlled consciously, it also works in an autonomous way.

Blood types A, 0, B and AB Blood types A, B. Danger. -Otomo, are you there? -Ken, are you there? Cute batik. Times have changed. -This was the 20.000 V. -This print looks old. Do you remember when this happened? In the twentieth century. Right? Definitely, in the twentieth century. You're using a Vestax platform. So it seems. Yes, it is a Vestax. One of the first models. What kind of sampler did you use first? An Akai. The S2000. Was it the mid nineties? Yes. More like the end of the nineties. Did you use it with a synthesizer? Yes. Did you ever learn to play an instrument? No, I've never played an instrument in my whole life. Is one of your songs called "Game Over"? "Game Over Generation". With the vocoder, and the melody inspired by the video games of our childhood. It's a song about the first generation of video-gamers. Did you belong to that first generation? In elementary school, I used to go to the arcades to play Space Invaders and stuff like that. It was against school rules. Many brought their rulers to play like this. To push the buttons? To fire faster. Amazing! I like it's shape. -The feminine shape? -Yes. I can't play an electric cello. Without this shape, it's impossible for me. Do you like breasts? Breasts? It's more like a butt, isn't it? What is it you like? The curves? I think this shape is quite perfect. The metal mast, symbolizes european modernism. I don't want to change the shape of the cello. If I changed the shape, It would be like if I was outside looking in. Denying modernism while we're living modernly, is what I'm trying to achieve. I saw there were useless things what could become useful. The many lights on the Vespa, for example. You don't need that many, but it only takes shape when you have them there. Everything becomes more expressive. The same happens with seafood restaurants. Fried noodles, for example. They're expensive, but if you eat them there they taste better. That's our concept. Exactly that. When I eat by the sea, instead of something fancy I prefer junk food like instant noodles. ?l wanted me to play guitar, this time he didn't want to play it himself. He said: "Take my place as guitarist". I thought it could work that way. The guitar is at the max volume, no matter who plays it. This is practically all. Many times you add a spring to the audio arm, right? I love this kind of home made audio. You create your sound well in advance. That's the idea. The sound of a record is picked up by the needle, and I wanted to experiment adding other objects. I broke many cartridges trying. Then I saw it would be easier using a contact microphone. After many failed attempts I made this work. What about you, L?K?O? I use three contact microphones on my mixer. How? To get the clatter when I'm scratching. Are you talking about the fader? Yes, the Vestax mixers produce a metallic sound I like. But I always end up hitting. Like a metal oil drum. The most primitive sound you can get with this system. The contact microphones allow for amplifying microscopic phenomena. That's really interesting. I put a basic contact microphone here, close my mouth and perform a diaphonic singing Chatter the teeth, hit my skull, and I send all the sounds through a guitar amplifier. The results are amazing. It's really fascinating to discover things you are not conscious you have inside. When you hear Yamakawa talk. you get the impression that he is very thoughtful, But on stage he's an animal! One time he was bashing his head like a madman, while I was hitting my mixer. He ended up rubbing his guitar against my record. I don't remember that. The guy is crazy! Composing is recording things that get inside of us. Memories travel through our bodies and minds, and their shapes shift inside the prism of our idiosyncrasy and personality to resurge in the shape of a composition or some other form of expression. That's why, when you listen to a sound of any kind more than listen to it, you remember it. To me, radio, CD's or television are memory triggers. I spontaneously remember sounds and many other things. Do you remember sounds? Yeah, thanks to those small stimuli. When you remember more than one thing once, You create something new. All the water in the world Ocean water and the fish that swim there, The water from the rivers and the fish that swim there, sing to the glory of Jesus Christ the creator I sing to His glory. Yes, I sing to His glory. Citizens! This year let's make the city bright and nice for everyone. More that feeding it's own culture, I believe Tokyo It's a crossbreed of all the cultures of the world. The consequence of the flow of information, to which we are exposed constantly, is the decadence of our own culture. The modern Japanese pop songs can't be described as neither Japanese nor songs. As an artist you're almost totally defined by the environment you grew up in. You're attached to your surroundings. The music that I create today is influenced by the environment in which I grew up with my parents, by the music I enjoy, the films. Everything is interconnected and shapes my music. In Japan. The cello is considered a bourgeois instrument. That image has discredited the instrument. Probably it can be used in a certain way, but to me that image is a burden, and the best way I found of getting rid of it was to use a sanding disk on the cello. -The sander! -The fire! It's the image of the cello that makes the sanding so intense. Sparks flying from the cello, it's so romantic. During a show, the memories of the audience come back to them. It's not about the sound. Our music interacts with the mind of each spectator. Like to memories committing to each other. My aim is to convoke the memories of the crowd. It's part of the performance. My strategy is to get to that confrontation of memories to create something chaotic. Each time I perform the diaphonic singing. I try to pierce the audience with the vibrations. I don't have a vocation for the traditional lyricism of the steppes, but I appreciate their beauty. Did you ever go in that direction? I went there of course. I met amazing singers that taught me many things. But I live here, and my way of expressing myself must take that into account. When I recur to spontaneity, I put a contact microphone on the bridge of my nose, I plug it to the amplifier and I increase the volume. How can I call the deepest memories? Today it would seem that urban landscapes that stimulate our memory are disappearing. In this day and age you don't feel anything. Those landscapes are being erased. Now, as you walk through Tokio, there's nothing that marvels. Only time will tell, but apart from their influence over our memory, I wonder if those landscapes will still exist in ten or twenty years. Can these buildings really last for ever? I don't believe they will last for so much time.
