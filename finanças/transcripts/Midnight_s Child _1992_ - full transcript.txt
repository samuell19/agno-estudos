[INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION] Hello. Are you in here? I got your note. What do you want? If this is some kind of a joke, I don't think it's funny. I'm going back now. [AIR HISSING] [SQUEAKING] [MAN SPEAKING ON TV] NICK: Hi. I'm sorry, Sid. I didn't mean to leaving you hanging. It's nuts here. Christina, could you turn that down, please? [CLATTERING] -Christina? -Oh, no! Christina. CHRISTINA: I was just practicing. NICK: It's your mother's favorite lamp. CHRISTINA: I'm sorry, Dad. NICK: You smashed it. Oh, no. CHRISTINA: I didn't mean it. It was an accident. It really was, Dad. NICK: I know, honey. I know it was an accident, but this is why we don't play T-ball in the house, okay? CHRISTINA: Okay, I'll take it outside. WOMAN ON TV: ...two tablespoons of raisins, three tablespoons of vinegar, one medium onion, two tablespoons of olive oil... Hello? Nick? CHRISTINA: Hey, Mom. KATE: What's going on here? NICK: It's under control. Christina. Chrissy, how many times have I told you not to play T-ball in the house? I forgot. We've been through this already, okay? I handled it. Okay, it's under control. -[MICROWAVE BEEPING] -Oh. Oh. Dinner is served. Anyway, they handed me Roger Pearlman's old office. You know, the corner one with the view. Charlie's been after it for five years. Pass the fried rice, please. Well, they spent a lot of money to lure you out here... It's in their best interest to keep you happy. Here, sweetie. Yeah, but Charlie isn't talking to me now. This is so ridiculous. How was your day? Oh, the usual. Doing the marketing, fighting with the butcher, slaving over a hot stove. Sweetheart, you really gonna eat all that? I'm hungry. Oh, yeah, and Sid called. -You got the job? -I don't know. The publicity people at the studio loved the concept. There's one more VP that has to sign off on it, but... Sid says I'm a shoo-in. Honey, that's great. -Oh, Sid! -What? I left him hanging on the phone, when that little crisis hit with the lamp. He must think I got sucked into a black hole. You're awfully quiet tonight. We went to the park this afternoon. Nobody was there. Dad said all the kids are in summer camp. I'm sorry. You know, we tried to get you in. We just applied too late. Nope, he's gone. Have to call him in the morning. You know, Anna's gonna be here in the next couple of days. You'll get to do lots of things with her. Mm-hmm. Seems to me we are pinning a lot of hopes on this girl. Cooking, cleaning, taking care of Chrissy. Big job. You know, my sister had them in Paris. They worked out really well. Hey, look, I want it to work as much as you do. Probably more. I just don't harbor any illusions that she's gonna march in here like Mary Poppins, wave her magic umbrella, and suddenly put our lives in order. You never know. CHRISTINA: Why do they call her an "old pear," Mom? [KATE LAUGHS] You mean "au pair." I don't know. It's French for something. I thought Anna was Swedish. She is Swedish. That's just what they call someone who looks after children. Mom? What if she doesn't like me? Well, of course she's gonna like you. Who doesn't? I promise, you and Anna are gonna be the best of friends. You know your cousin Sarah. Her au pair, they really love each other. Come on, into bed. [CHRISTINA GIGGLES] Hop in. Cuddle up. Can you take me to Mystery Mountain this week? Hmm. I wish I could. I've got to work. You've got to work. Daddy's got to work. Well, let's see what we could do. We could plan on going later on in the month. Oh, but wait a minute. What? Daddy says we only go to Mystery Mountain when it's a special celebration..., If only we had a special celebration coming up. My birthday. Your birthday! Of course! You knew that all the time. I did. -Good night. -Good night. I love you. I love you too. -Hi. -Hi. What are you doing? Oh, just cleaning up. Getting organized for my big splash in show business. You know, I wanted to thank you. Oh, yeah? For what? For moving 3,000 miles away from home so I could get a better job. For taking care of Chrissy all the time for the past few weeks. For being very flexible. Well, my career wasn't exactly... burning up the road in New York. So I didn't really have all that much to lose. Well, things are gonna start coming around for you, I know it. -Yeah? -Mm-hmm. -I mean, you have this whole movie poster thing going. -Mm-hmm. And a whole host of fringe benefits. -Oh, yeah? -Yeah. Like what? Like women are inexplicably attracted to men who are in show business. Yeah? [KNOCKING AT DOOR] WOMAN: Hello? Ignore 'em. We're not home. [KNOCKING CONTINUES] -I really... -WOMAN: Hello? We really should get it. It's gonna wake Christina. [EXHALES] -[KNOCKING AT DOOR] -Yeah. Mrs. Cowan? Yes. I'm Anna Bergman. The au pair. Oh. Anna, I'm sorry. Please come in. NICK: Hey, no, let me get those. ANNA: Oh, thank you. KATE: I'm Kate, and this is Nick. -Hi. -Hi. This is a surprise. Oh, well, yes. We weren't expecting you for at least two days. I'm sorry. I hope I haven't inconvenienced you. I called to confirm my flight, there was some kind of mix-up with my reservations. Well, that's okay, you're here now. Yes. -So... -Please. Well, you have a beautiful home. Oh, thank you. You know, you should have called us from the airport. We would have picked you up. Please, there was no problem. I took a taxi. It was a beautiful ride. Everything here is so rugged, so wild-looking. Yeah, well, Nick's been meaning to clean it up. Right. Yeah, I got a lot of time for that. Excuse me. Well, you must be exhausted. I'll show you your room. Here we are. Small, yet tiny. It's lovely. Really. Is Christina sleeping? Yes. She's gonna be so disappointed she missed your arrival. Oh. Well, I can't wait to meet her. Well, yes, in the morning. Listen, why don't you unpack, and make yourself comfortable? Yeah. Is there anything wrong? No, I just... The keys for my suitcase, I left them in one of my pockets. Maybe it's in your purse. No, uh... I don't think so. I put it in one of my pockets. Do you think you could get these open for Anna? Sure. I'll just get my toolbox. I'm sorry, Mrs. Cowan. Kate. And, Anna, really, it's no big deal. Yeah. Aren't you getting your tools? What? What do you mean, "What"? So, what do you think? -I think she seems sweet. -Hmm, yeah. And not a heck of a lot going on upstairs. [KNOCKING AT DOOR] Come in. Anna, this is Christina. Christina, this is Anna. ANNA: Well, hello there. KATE: Aren't you gonna say hello? Hi. I'm very happy to meet you. Would you like to come in and talk to me? Well, go ahead. You're awfully big. How old are you? Twenty? Twenty-five? No, seven. Almost eight. It's going to be my birthday soon. Yeah, I know. July 24th. How did you know that? Well, your mother wrote and told me. I wrote it in my diary, so I wouldn't forget. See? Here we are. Christina's birthday. Well, I've got to get to work. But I can see the two of you are gonna get along just fine. Yeah, I'm sure that we will. Okay, just a few things. The laundry's really piling up, so if you wouldn't mind right after breakfast... -I'll take care of it. -There's a lasagna in the freezer. We'll have that for dinner tonight. I should be home about 6:30. I'll try not to be late, 'cause we like to eat at 7:00. -Okay, okay. -My office number is on the fridge. You can call me any time and Nick will be working here all day. I will be fine, Mrs. Cowan. KATE: Oh. The emergency numbers. Fire, police, ambulance, you just dial 911. Thank you. I'm sure that we won't need them. You be a good girl. You listen to Anna. Okay. "Dear Mr. Monteiro, I am pleased to enclose a copy of our draft contract for you to review and comment upon." Hey, come on. We've got to get going. Yeah, all right, just a sec. Where was I? "Contract for you to review and comment upon." "Please call us with your comments at your earliest convenience. Sincerely, blah blah blah." Thanks. I don't think I'm gonna make it through this. When we get there, they'll probably keep us waiting half an hour, and then if we're five minutes late, they'll throw a fit. -Oh, God. -What? -I forgot to call Nick. -Why? Anna, the au pair, she started today. I wanted to check in. Oh, come on. No, we don't have time. Let's go. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Hello. KATE: Hi, baby. I only have a minute. How's it going? You got to be kidding. What's the matter? NICK: The girl is a walking disaster area. That's what's the matter. -Anna? -Yes, Anna. I spent more time running around today than the last three weeks combined. First we had a spoon jam up the garbage disposal, then she tried to heat up a pot of soup in the microwave. Sparks flying everywhere. It was like the Fourth of July. And to top it off, I spent the last hour knee-deep in suds, mopping up the flood from our washing machine. Oh, I'm sorry, honey. Do you want me to talk to her? Put her on the phone. No, I can't. She's in her room, crying. Honey, I gotta go. I'm gonna be late for a meeting. Can you just deal with this until I get home, okay? Just until then, all right? Very easy for you to say. KATE: I love you. I love you, too. Hi, pumpkin. Hi, Mom. Guess what. Anna broke the washing machine. It was a huge flood. Boy, was Daddy mad. Yeah, I heard. Where is Daddy? I don't know. I think he's painting. Well, I have to go take care of something. Could you please put these cookies away and clean up? Anna? What are you doing? I think it's best this way that I go. Mr. Cowan is right to be angry. I just never had such a big house to take care of. Everything here is so much more different than it is at home. I'm sorry, Mrs. Cowan. I... I just wanted this job so much. I know. Anna, look. I understand and Nick understands that this is a new experience for you. You move to a new country, a family full of strangers, an unfamiliar house. I mean, it's a big adjustment. We want this to work as much as you do. I'm willing to give it another shot if you are. What do you say? Do we have a deal? Thank you. Well, I'll help you unpack. That's all right, Mrs. Cowan. I can do it. Thank you. Okay. Well, I'll go see about getting some dinner on the table. Yes, indeed, Mrs. Cowan. We have a deal. DR. GROSBARD: Why did you take so long to contact me? We thought all of our girls were accounted for, Dr. Grosbard. It wasn't until workmen were clearing debris from the fire that they found the body. Some of the girls had already left for the summer break. It was difficult to determine who was missing. How did it start? There appears to have been a gas leak in the science lab. -There was a terrible explosion. -Oh. I know how difficult this must be for you, Doctor. But you must believe and accept that Kirsten is in God's grace. And where's her room? Mm-hmm. That was her desk. And this is where she slept. Were there any personal effects? Jewelry or a wristwatch? She wore a pendant around her neck, always. Now it's not here. Perhaps she lost it. -Perhaps it was destroyed. -Mm-hmm. Where is her passport? It must be here. Damn you! Damn you! You were supposed to watch her. Her roommate. Now, where is she? She's not here. She left the night of the accident. She left? Where? Where? What is her name? Anna Bergman. She went to America to work for a family there. Now, she and Kirsten. Were they close? I suppose so. Kirsten asked to be switched to her room several months ago. I want to see Kirsten. I would advise against it, HerrDoctor. She has been badly burned, almost beyond recognition. The police report is very thorough. If you would care to look at it... I'm not interested in the police report, and I am not interested in your well-intentioned recommendations. I want to see my daughter! Now, is that possible, Reverend Mother? I'll make the arrangements. Her face has been badly disfigured. That is not Kirsten. That is not my daughter. Paragraph six. "The rights granted to you hereunder are personal and shall not be assigned by you in any part to any third party." You know, I think I'm actually learning to like the taste of Styrofoam. Excuse me. It's Nick on line one. Stay calm, baby. No. Hi, baby. What's up? Well, I got some good news and some bad news. Which you want first? -Give me the good. -Okay. Sid called. The last guy signed off. They approved my sketches. Well, Nick, that's wonderful. So what about the bad news? The bad news is they approved my sketches. So, now I've got to do the damn thing, and I'm stuck. KATE: You'll be okay. You know you always start off like this. I thought you were calling with some horror story about Anna. No, actually, she's okay. I don't know what you said to her the other day, but so far, no major screw-ups. Well, do you think you trust her enough to make Chrissy and you dinner? Why? You working late again? You know I don't like it any more than you do, but I'll be home as soon as I can. Mm-hmm. Nick, I adore you. Yeah. Talk to you later. What, another flood? Your family floating around the living room? No. I think our little Anna's gonna work out just fine. Yeah? Yeah. [GROWLS] [LAUGHS] Excuse me. Do you have an aspirin? I have a splitting headache. [BOTH LAUGH] Pardon me. Would you pass the cheese, please? Oh! Christina, you have some wonderful costumes here. You know what? I have just the perfect thing to add to it. Come on. What do you think? You look very sophisticated. I think I need some lipstick. It's on the dresser. [GRUNTS] Chrissy, look at this. -Oh, it's pretty. -Do you like it? This was my dress at your age. Look at that. It almost fits. Here, come see in the mirror. Oh, it's beautiful. You look just like a bride. -Do I really? -Yeah. I'm going to get married someday. Well, I know you are. You know, Chrissy, when you get married, it's a big responsibility. You have to devote your life to your husband, become his soul mate, and do everything in your power to make him happy. How will I know what to do? You'll find out. Excuse me. Do you work in this office? Yes, but I'm sorry. We're closed. No, I understand, but perhaps you can help me anyway. I'm trying to find a girl. Well, if you come in tomorrow, Dr. Grosbard, you can fill in an application. No, you see, she works for you. You've placed her with an American family. Her name is Anna Bergman. We place many girls here, but I'm sure you understand, details of the transactions must remain strictly confidential. Listen, I understand, but this is an entirely different situation. My daughter has run away, and she and Anna Bergman were close friends. In fact, they were best friends. So I was hoping that Anna would know where she has gone. I'm sorry, Dr. Grosbard. Truly, I am. You don't understand. There is not much time. You must tell me where she is. I'm sorry. I cannot help you. Please let me go. But you can call her, can't you? I can call a policeman if you don't let me go. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please, will you help me? Please? Fine. I'll call her. Check with me tomorrow. Yes, but tomorrow could be... I'll call tomorrow and let you know what I find out. Thank you. Nick? In here. -What is this? -Entrer, madame. What's going on? Well, it seems that Mary Poppins finally waved her magic umbrella. Swedish fruit soup, with a dollop of sour cream. Poached salmon with a little fresh dill. And we even have a very special home-made plum pudding with brandy sauce. Anna did all this? Cooked it, baked it, spent half the day shopping for it, and you should see the dinner she made for Christina. Well, I'm impressed. What can I say? You can say you're relieved. At least the girl knows how to do something right. Well, there was never a doubt in my mind. No? Never? Not even just a little? [CHUCKLES] I'm gonna go say good night to Chrissy. Okay. KATE: And don't touch any of that food until I get back. -Hi, Mom. -Hi, pumpkin. Anna. Anna's been showing me all these neat pictures of Sweden. The snow and mountains, and sleds and horses. Well, Anna's been doing all kinds of neat things today. It was a beautiful dinner you prepared. Thank you. It's my pleasure, Mrs. Cowan. Will you read me a bedtime story tonight? Well, sure, I'd love to. Well, in that case, I'll say good night. And will save my story for some other time. Oh, were you gonna read to her, Anna? Oh, it's all right. It's not important. Chrissy, why don't you let Anna read to you tonight? Daddy and I haven't had our dinner yet. I can read to you tomorrow night, okay? I guess. -Good night. -Good night. Good night, Anna. Good night, Mrs. Cowan, and enjoy your dinner. What would you like to read? -This one. -Okay. You look fantastic. May I suggest, madam, before the soup, Miss Anna's home-brewed lingonberry wine? It's a very amusing vintage, actually. Hmm. What year? -Week ago Tuesday. -[LAUGHS] It was a very good day for lingonberries. Skol. Hmm, tad on the sweet side. Yeah, just a touch. But it's good. It grows on you. Yeah? [BOTH LAUGHING] What's this? That's just some drawings of mine. What kind of drawings? Sort of like... a fairytale, about a princess. Can we read it? Sure, if you like. Oh, it's pretty. Where are the words? Well, we read the pictures and they give us the words. Now, once upon a time, there was a beautiful young girl... With pretty hair. ...who lived in the forest with her... CHRISTINA: Mother and father. And as she was walking through the woods, something caught her eye. What is it? ANNA: Hanging from a branch, at the end of a golden chain, there was a pendant. Pendant? Like this. Except, the one on the branch bark was like the colors of the rainbow. But who did it belong to? Oh, he's handsome. ANNA: Isn't he? He's a real prince. And this pendant is a gift that he gives to the girl who would be his bride. But who gave you your pendant? Well, that's a secret. I won't tell. Well, if I tell you, Christina, you must promise not to tell anyone. Not even your mother or your father. I won't. I promise. I was married once. -You were? -Yeah. You're awfully young. Well, maybe, but it was the most important day of my life. Who'd you marry? He was a prince. -Get out of here. -No, I'm serious. A real prince, and a very powerful man. And he chose me out of all the girls in his kingdom to be his bride. What happened to him? Where is he now? My father took me away from him. Why? I don't know. [SIGHS] But this pendant is something we both share. It ties us together. And no matter how far away my father takes me, my prince and I will always be together. That's so romantic. Yeah. Maybe one day, when you have your prince, you'll have one of these. Would you like that? Yeah? Okay. Some day. CHRISTINA: And she goes to look for the prince, but that mean spirit, the one who doesn't want her to find him, gets her lost in the woods. KATE: Hmm, sounds frightening. Thank you, Anna. ANNA: Would you like some more pancakes, Mrs. Cowan? No. No, but they're wonderful. How about you, Chrissy? -I think Chrissy's had enough. -Yes, please. Okay, coming right up, miss. Anna. Just one more for Chrissy. All right. So what happened next? So she gets lost in the woods, and her father goes to look for her. But that mean spirit makes the forest all black. Like it's night. And that's when the prince comes along on his beautiful horse and saves her. "Oh, the prince." Did I hear someone call my name? No, Daddy, you're not the prince. The prince is handsome. Thank you, sweetheart. CHRISTINA: The prince was in Anna's picture story. Anna's an excellent artist. I'm sure she is. Anna, you should show your drawings to Daddy. He's an artist too. It's just a hobby, really. Something that I do for myself. Uh-huh. This looks great. What's today's date? The 20th. Why? Four more days to Mystery Mountain. Well, I don't think we're very anxious, are we? Listen, I've gotta go. You have a good day. Bye. And you have a breakthrough. -[KNOCKING AT DOOR] -It's open. Hi. Hope I'm not disturbing you. No. You can't disturb somebody who isn't doing anything. What's up? I thought you might like some coffee. Thanks. Coffee sounds great. -This is quite impressive. -Mm. Yeah. Thanks. I like this one. It's interesting. Key art. It's a one-sheet for a movie poster. For the cinema? Yeah, it will be, if I ever finish it. I just can't seem to get a sense of... I can't get a handle on it. Wait. What is the film about? It's a thriller about a family under siege. I've painted this damn thing six times. This is the worst one, actually. It look like they're posing for a Christmas card. Well, thanks for the coffee. I brought the drawings. The drawings. Oh, right. Your drawings. If this is a bad time, I can come back, or... No, that's okay. Let's have a look. These are not exactly professional. I'm sorry. It's the other way. Hmm. I like this. -Really? -Really. Can you see what's happening? Well, it's a man in the dark. A forest. He's in the forest. And he's lost something. His daughter. He's searching for his daughter. I like the way you've obscured the forest, and hidden things in the trees. It's almost like you can see her hiding in the shadows. It's as though he were afraid of the darkness but drawn towards it. Well, sort of like the poster. Excuse me if I sound so presumptuous. No, no, no, that's okay. Or perhaps if... ...the background was a little less defined so that the family is drawn to the darkness. Even though it's frightening. Because there's safety in the shadows. I must go back to work now. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Yeah. Hello? WOMAN: Oh, good morning. This is the Au pair exchange calling from Stockholm. Is Mrs. Cowan there, please? Speaking. I'm sorry to disturb you, Mrs. Cowan, but I have a gentleman here, -a Dr. Grosbard. -DR. GROSBARD: Grosbard. He's trying to contact Anna Bergman. Is she available? I'm afraid she's gone out. Perhaps I can help you. Well, it seems that Anna is a friend of his daughter. -Kirsten. -Kirsten Grosbard. -She has disappeared. -Oh, how awful! And he thought that Anna might have some idea where she was. Look, why don't you give me the information, and when Anna returns, I'll have her call him, okay? WOMAN: Do you have a pencil? Right here. -It's Dr. Stefan Grosbard. -Grosbard. -Telephone... -I'll give you the number. -4... -Excuse me. Hello. This is Dr. Grosbard speaking. This is Kirsten's father, and I must speak with Anna immediately. It's a matter of great emergency. It is absolutely imperative that I speak to her without delay. Damn it. Damn them! -Hi. -Hi. I'm home. Oh, strong. I like it. Yeah. It's the craziest thing. Anna came in here to show me one of her drawings, which are very good. She's got talent. And one of them just set me off. -Really? -It's very interesting. You change the light, you change the whole thing. You want to take a break? Want to get something to eat with me? No. Actually, honey, I ate already. Thanks. You did? Well, you wanna keep me company while I eat? No, I really want to nail this before I lose it. You don't mind, do you? No, of course not. -I'll see you inside. -Uh-huh. -Hi. -Hi. All washed up? Let me look at those pearly whites. Oh. Can I see the back ones? Dazzling. How about I read you a special story tonight? A couple of chapters of Charlotte's Web. Well, maybe tomorrow. Anna's waiting for me. She's going to tell me some more of her picture story. Oh, all right. Well, then, let's brush that hair then. Mom, Anna did it already. Can't you tell? Oh. Well, how about a good night hug then? Good night, Mom. [SIGHS] You're still up. I wanted to wait for you. Did you finish up? For today, yeah. [GROANS] Would you rub my neck, honey? I'm feeling a little tense. Tough day? Brutal. That feels good. Too many hours. I've been missing you. Yeah, I've been missing you too. [ALARM RINGING] What time is it? It's quarter to 8:00. I can't believe you have to go to work today. Even God took a day off, you know? It's 8:00, Christina. If you want breakfast, you're gonna have to come in now. Hi, Mom. Good morning. Good morning, honey. Oh, good morning, Mrs. Cowan. Would you care for some breakfast? No, thank you, Anna. Isn't today your day off? Well, I was up and Christina was hungry. Maybe let me get you at least some coffee or some toast. No, thank you. I'll get something at the office. -Have a good day, pumpkin. -Bye. Have a nice day, Mrs. Cowan. [INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION] [BOTH LAUGHING] ANNA: But it's nice if you have a bit of contrast. If the prince is with the dark hair, -then the princess has more light. -CHRISTINA: Okay. Yeah. -Go down like that? -ANNA: Yeah. Yeah, that's nice. A nice imprint in the forehead. It's very nice. Look, Daddy. Look what I did. The girl and the prince, they're getting married. Hmm, very nice. She's gifted, isn't she? You know, they say that talent like this runs in the family. -Mommy can't draw. -[NICK LAUGHS] [GASPS] Look what time it is, Christina. Got to hurry. Come on, help me clean this up. What's the rush? Where are you going? Anna won't tell me. It's a surprise. It's a surprise. Can I come? Well, it's something special. Just for the girls. -Please? -No. No boys allowed. Right, Anna? -That's right. -I'll wear a dress. [CHRISTINA LAUGHS] Goodbye, Nick. I'm sorry. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm all right. Oh, I wish I could say the same for these. Who are you? Bob McDowell. Bob's Greenskeeping Unlimited. New gardener. You wouldn't be Mrs. Cowan by any chance? Yes. -Pleased to meet you. -Hey, what's going on? I was gonna ask you the same question. Mrs. Cowan and I had a bit of run-in. I'm afraid I broke your eggs. That's okay. We'll deduct it from your bill. -Okay. -Let me take one of these. I'm sorry about that. -I guess I'll... -It's okay. I'll get started on the chaparral on the side of the house. Right. Who's he? Only the best landscape artist in Topanga. Can we afford this? I mean, all the rose bushes? You won't believe how cheap he is. I really got to hand it to Anna. -Anna? -Yeah. What does she got to do with this? She found him. She bumped into him at the mini-mart. And the next thing you know, he's reworking his calendar to fit us in. -[SCOFFS] -What? I mean, this is a big decision. Don't you think we should have discussed it? Honey, you have been bugging me to clean this place up since we moved here. Now, I've been busy, you've been busy. I thought you would be thrilled. I'm thrilled. Where's Christina? She and Anna went off somewhere this morning. Some big secret. CHRISTINA: Ooh! Ooh! NICK: What is this? CHRISTINA: We had the best time today. Anna took me to Mystery Mountain. And she bought me this costume, and I wore it in the haunted house. I scared everybody. I thought we were gonna go to Mystery Mountain together. Anna took me today instead. We went on all the rides. Hello. Anna, tell them about the roller coaster. ANNA: All right, Chrissy, we'll tell them all about your day a little later. But right now, I want you to take off the costume and go and get washed up. I'll make some dinner. I'll be making dinner tonight, Anna, thank you very much. Please take Chrissy to her room. All right. Come on. What was that all about? She knew I was planning to take Christina for her birthday. Anna? Christina has been talking about it for four weeks. So what are you saying? That you think she did it deliberately? I don't know what to think. Where are my saucepans? Anna! -Would you calm down? -I am calm, Nick. Anna! Anna! Yes, Mrs. Cowan. Where are my saucepans? The saucepans are... Well, I put them in the cabinet over the stove. Did I ask you to rearrange my kitchen? No, but I just thought that it might be more efficient. My kitchen was perfectly efficient before. I want things where I put them, not where you think they belong. All right? Yes, of course. And were you also aware that I had plans to take Christina to Mystery Mountain for her birthday? No, I was not. Chrissy didn't tell you? No. I had no idea. I'm sorry if I ruined your plans. It was not my intention. Fine. In the future, I expect you would check with me before you go on another one of your secret outings. Is that understood? Yes. I'm sorry. Damn it! Don't you think you are overreacting just a little bit? Oh, I'm overreacting? Fine. Then you make dinner. I'm gonna take a nap. CHRISTINA: Mommy? Mommy. Mommy, come on. Mom, wake up. Mommy. Mom. Mommy. What? CHRISTINA: Dinner's ready, come on. Okay. I'm coming. CHRISTINA: Ooh, ooh! Ooh, ooh! Ooh! KATE: Why are you still wearing that? Come on, Mom. It's a surprise. What's with the lights? I don't like surprises. Nick? Nick? Turn on the lights. NICK: Come on, honey, we're just playing. It's a game. CHRISTINA: ♪ Here we go round The mulberry bush ♪ The mulberry bush The mulberry bush ♪ Here we go round The mulberry bush ♪ So early in the morning ♪ Here we go round The mulberry bush ♪ Chrissy, stop. Enough is enough. Nick, turn on the lights. Come here, sweetheart. Come here. ♪ Kate's not wanted anymore ♪ Gonna throw her Out the door ♪ [NICK LAUGHING] Are you crazy? What are you doing? Perhaps some lingonberry wine before dinner, Mrs. Cowan? Stop it. Please. ANNA: What's the matter, Katie? Don't you like the way it tastes? -[NICK LAUGHING] -I made it especially for you. [GASPS] [INDISTINCT LAUGHTER] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] [INDISTINCT LAUGHTER] -One for you. -[LAUGHTER] What are you doing? Hi. We just sat down. I didn't want to wake you. Give me that. What is the matter with you? What are you doing? What are you, crazy? What was that all about? I don't know. Just... I saw the three of you there, and something snapped. I don't... I want to get rid of her. Anna? -Yes, Anna. Of course Anna. -Why? Because she rearranged your cabinets? Because she took Chrissy to an amusement park? Yes. That and a dozen other reasons that you probably are gonna think are petty and ridiculous. You know, the way her drawings inspire you. The way she brushes Chrissy's hair at night, and whispers secrets in her ear. The way she makes me feel like a stranger in my house. The main thing is, I don't like her. And I don't think she likes me very much. Okay. Fine. We'll get rid of her. Just like that? Yeah, just like that. I'll call the agency first thing in the morning, and I will get the ball rolling. It could take a little while before we get a replacement. Can you hang in with her until then? You don't think I'm being petty and ridiculous, do you? No. You can't help how you feel. It's just bad chemistry, that's all. -Hi. -Hi. -What you doing? -Coloring. Can I see? That's some building you're working on. What is it? A castle? It's a church. Oh, yes, of course, I see. This is the steeple, right? What are these? Are these clouds? It's smoke. The church is on fire. Well, this is interesting. Is that you? -And Daddy? -No, that's the prince. The prince? Anna says I'm going to marry a prince. Just like she... Just like she what, sweetheart? Nothing. Would you like one? Sure. You know, I wanted to come in, 'cause I wanted to make sure... I just wanted you to know that I wasn't feeling well earlier. But I'm all right. I just didn't want you to feel scared. Anna said you were sleepwalking. I guess I was. I must have been. Thank you. Anyway, I was thinking. I think it would be fun if we had a party here for your birthday. Would you like that? -Mom? -Hmm? When I grow up, I'm going to be an artist, and take care of children, just like Anna. Well, I think you have a long time to decide things like that, don't you? How about some green over here? I guess so. Were you angry at Anna for taking me to Mystery Mountain? Yes, I was a little angry. Because we had plans. But we're gonna have a wonderful time at the party tomorrow instead, aren't we? I'm done now. May I be excused? -Hi, Bob. -Christina, come here. I wanna show you something. -Is that for me? -Mm-hmm. It's for your party. I love it. Could I put it on? Not right now. I'll tell you what though. Why don't you take it in the house and show it to Anna? Not right now. So are you feeling any better now? I guess. I called the agency this morning. And? Be a couple of weeks, but they can send us a new girl. -When are we gonna tell Anna? -Whenever we want. Probably a good idea to wait until we know exactly when the new one will get here. You know, I didn't want things to turn out this way. I know. Like I said, it's just bad chemistry. Look what Anna gave me to wear for my birthday. Oh, honey, you look beautiful. She looks just like a little bride, doesn't she, Mrs. Cowan? [BOTH LAUGHING] It's so funny. Hi. Good morning. Where were you all last night? In the studio, painting. I'm going to the office. Where's Christina? She's still sleeping. When will you be home? Sometime in the afternoon. Now, I don't get it. Nick agreed that this little Miss Scandinavia has got to go, right? Right. So, what's the problem? The problem is, I don't believe him. I think he's just telling me what he thinks I want to hear. I woke up last night, Nick was gone. This morning, he's in the kitchen, all warm and cozy with Anna. He says he was working in the studio all night. So you think that there might be something going on between them? I don't know what to think anymore, Liz. I really don't. I mean, because if that's what you're thinking, you have to talk to him. Just lay your cards out on the table. Yeah, you're right. And if that doesn't work, shoot him. Thanks. I'm gonna talk to him tonight. No, you'll talk to him right now. No, I've got work I've got to do now. Forget about the office. I will cover for you. All right? Get out of here. Go on. I'll call you. Okay. Christina? Hi, Mom. What are you doing? Get down from there. Where did you get these? Bob gave them to me. And where's Anna? I don't know. I think she went somewhere with Daddy. And left you here all alone? I'm not alone. Bob's here. Christina. Christina, I'm not done talking to you. Hi, Bob. Hi. How are you? Hello. I'll take this one. You take the other one. -But don't let Christina see... -Uh-oh. Dad, what did you get? No peeking, Christina. No peeking. I want to talk to you. Come on, Chrissy. Let's go. What the hell is going on here? -What do you mean? -What do I mean? You and Anna out gallivanting in the middle of the day? We were not gallivanting. We went to pick up Chrissy's presents and get a few things for the party. And you left Chrissy here with Bob? Bob is all right. Chrissy's crazy about him. No, I don't care. I don't know what's going on. I don't know what she's trying to do, but she's not gonna get away with it. Do you hear me? What are you talking about, Anna? Are you sleeping with her? You are being really ridiculous. Tell me, Nick. Answer me. No. I want that woman out of my house. Now. Today. And what do you propose we do with Chrissy? I don't know. -We'll figure out something. -So what do we tell her? That Anna had to go away because Mommy couldn't stand the competition? What the hell is that supposed to mean? It means that all of this paranoia about me and Anna is really about you and Anna. It means that maybe you're just a little bit afraid of losing your daughter to a woman who's better at being a mother than you are. You bastard. I don't have time for this, okay? You want to fire her? Fire her. Just leave me out of it, okay? Where are you going? For a ride. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Hello. Mrs. Cowan? -Yes. -This is Stefan Grosbard. You must listen to me carefully. We don't have much time. Your daughter's in great danger. What are you talking about? Who are you? DR. GROSBARD: Please, just listen to me. The young woman who's caring for your little girl, she's not the real Anna Bergman at all. She is my daughter. Her name in Kirsten Grosbard, and she is an evil... An evil young woman who will stop at nothing to get what she wants. What does she want? Your child, Mrs. Cowan. Christina has been chosen. Chosen? To make a bond with the Devil. This is absurd. What are you talking about? Some kind of a cult? I know it's difficult for you to understand, and to believe, but please, I swear to you, what I'm saying is very real. It is very real. You must get your daughter away from there. Get Christina away from that place, and away from my daughter. Now, is there somewhere we can meet? I'm at LAX now. Hello. Are you there? Yes. There's an old hotel on Pacific Coast Highway. North of Canyon Glen. Do you know where it is? I will find it, but please hurry. Please. And I will pray for you, Mrs. Cowan. I will pray for you. Come on, sweetheart. Let's go. Christina? Christina? Christina? Christina? Christina? Nick. What are you doing here? I know who you are, Kirsten. I spoke to your father. Get out of this house. Christina stays. We'll see about that, won't we? Chrissy, come on, we're leaving. -Where are we going? -We're gonna go on a trip. -Just you and me. -I don't want to go on a trip. Do as you're told. No. Mommy, I don't wanna go. Let me go! -Do as you're told, Christina. -Let me go. I don't wanna go. -Let me go. -Christina! -Let her go. -Let me go! Don't let her do this, Nick. Help me, please. Anna, maybe we should tell her. Shut up, Nick. NICK: It's best, Kate. You can't take care of Chrissy right now. CHRISTINA: Let go of me! KATE: No, Christina. Christina. Come with me, baby. Go away. Now get out. I'll be back for you, baby. It's all right now. Go to your father. Why is she doing this to us? What does she want from us? My daughter is fulfilling a pact, Mrs. Cowan. A pact with the Devil. From each generation he chooses a bride. A little child. On her eighth birthday, she's offered, in red. They put a charm around her neck. Red crystal pendant. A symbol of their bond. Then on her 21st birthday, she will bear him a child. She will raise the child to maturity, she will groom him to take the positions of power. Yes, my daughter has spoken her vows, Mrs. Cowan. Just as yours will tonight, unless we stop them. My baby, she wouldn't come with me. Kirsten seduced her, the way she seduced your husband, the way her predecessor defrauded me of my little daughter. My dear wife was driven to her grave. We don't have much time. My daughter has a black liturgy. It's rather like a book of rites, like a children's book of pictures. My God. I've seen it. -[CAT SCREECHES] -[SCREAMS] -Shh. -[OBJECTS CLATTERING] Now, the ceremony cannot be performed without the book. So we must find it, destroy it, break the spell. And get your daughter back. [INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING] [GROANS] [TIRES SCREECHING] [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] I give thee Christina. [ANNA SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Christina! [BOTH GRUNTING] Please come to me, baby. Please come to Mommy. Let me through, Nick. She's got our little girl. She'll be safe. Why? Tell her, Nick. The future. I wanted my career back. And Christina will be set for life. You can join us, Kate. KATE: Is that what you want? For Christina to be like her? Driven to obey? Driven to murder? For God's sake, Nick, she had her own father killed! I didn't know that. [GASPS] Nick! Nick! Help me, please. Kate! KATE: No! NICK: Get off of her! [GRUNTS] [BOTH GRUNTING] KATE: Nick! No! No! [GRUNTS] [BOB SCREAMS] KATE: Christina? Christina? You can come out. You come to Mommy now. Where is she? It's too late. You've lost her. I don't believe you. Christina? She's his servant now. She answers only to him. Mommy? Christina? Honey? Christina, please. I love you, baby. Satan loves her. She's his bride now. Christina, please. Come to me, baby. It's okay. Stay where you are, Christina. The Prince will be very angry. You don't have to be frightened. Just throw the book in the fire, Christina. I'm scared, Mommy. He'll punish you, Christina. -He'll hurt you very badly. -It's okay. No one's gonna hurt you, pumpkin. ANNA: Do as I say, Christina. Christina! Do it! Chrissy. No! -No! -Come to me, baby. NICK: Come on. This way. No! No! [SCREAMING] KATE: It's all right, baby. It's all over. OFFICER: That's it, Chief. Just the one outside. If there's another body in here, I sure don't see it. NEWSREADER: A three-alarm fire in a residential Pacific Palisades neighborhood is reportedly under control. One fatality is confirmed. An unidentified white male. -Hello. -We're not going very far. Neither am I. I'll just get in the back. -Mm-hmm. -Sure. Hello there. Hello. ANNA: You're awfully big. How old are you? Twenty? Twenty-five? [GIRL GIGGLING]
