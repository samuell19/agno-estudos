Put it back before the store guys catch you Ma'am, let the kid have it No. It's okay Even if you don't want, you must take it Because he already paid for it Who paid for it? Him. The guy who's leaving in his bike Don't you link up Samyukta's murder and Amudha missing case with that doll's head That doll's head is the only evidence we got We must climb up using that thread Don't teach me to climb up using thread and tail Come on, you must support me We can definitely catch him Don't strain too much Already David Raja, who threatened to kill Amudha, has been arrested The case will be almost solved and closed by end of day today No! This case won't resolve today! Why would you say that? Brother-in-law, please hear me out It's true that I proposed her with a love letter, madam But I ain't that daring to kill her, madam Then why did you run at the sight of the police? It was purely out of fear, madam This is the right time. Shall I talk about the evidence? That lady is very arrogant and egoistic She won't even respond properly to higher officials orders There is no way she'll even pay heed to sub ordinates like you Then you go, tell her Myself? Just keep quiet I am just obeying her orders and leading a peaceful life with this salary Don't you drag me into mess This investigation is heading in the wrong direction Be happy that it's going in some direction. Just let it go - Stop pestering me - Listen to me, please You! What's going on there? Well ma'am, he was inquiring about this case Come here Your thrashing must make him speak the truth! Go ahead Now, get started. Hit him! Please don't beat me up, madam. I am innocent, madam Hello... Hi darling Did you have your food? Mommy's busy right now... I am innocent, sir What did granny say? It hurst! Please no! Is it? Be a good girl and obey your grandma. Ok? I shall call you later. Ok? Okay darling, I'm hanging up the call now What's wrong with you? Ma'am, there is no use in bashing him up The killer we are looking for isn't a rapist or a kidnapper or a stalker like him A mentally unstable guy who carefully plans and kills his victim I mean he is a...a psychopath Stop blabbing Ma'am, just a minute Ma'am, excuse me This is Samyukta, who was missing earlier And this is Amudha who went missing two days ago The coincidence here between these two? Both of them are 15 years old school students... and were kidnapped when they returning home from school This is Samyukta's photo when her corpse was found two days later in the bushes This is the photo of the doll's head that was found when Amudha was kidnapped two days ago Now, watch this ma'am Just like Samyukta, the hair on doll's forehead is uprooted Just like Samyukta's eyes are drilled and her mouth is damaged... the same is done to the doll Apart from that, in particular... a knife mark on Samyukta's forehead... on her ears... and on her nasion The same marks can be found in the doll's face too So... it's with these instances you come to the conclusion that it's the same man... I mean... you say the so called psychopath did this, right? Not just this ma'am. 27% from the list of the psychopaths across the world... leave their mark when the kidnap or murder their victims For example... in 1970s a serial killer named Zodiac, from America... murdered ten people and left a cross as his mark at the spot A psycho named Dennis Radar always left a woman's symbol at the spot Only when viewed in landscape mode, it was found that... it read his initials BTK In south Mumbai, India, a psycho named Ravinder murdered his victims and... left beer tin on the spot as his mark John Allen and Malan from Washington, US used- -a card named 'Calling card' as their mark Similarly, a psycho named John Fianse left a broken cross as his mark Some of them had their methods of killing as their mark During 19th century, in London, a psycho named Jack the ripper... murdered call girls and split their body into two halves The reason they leave their mark or sign? Because with every attack people started fearing their sign and in turn them The psychopaths enjoyed that fear That is what they survive on There are hundreds of such examples, ma'am This damaged doll head is one such sign! He would have started enjoying the fear he has instigate on us Which is why, I am requesting that let's probe in this direction So, you mean I'm headed in the wrong direction? Ma'am, I didn't meant it that way So, when Samyukta died, no such doll head was found Ma'am, let's inquire that Okay Why are you so much interested in Samyukta's murder case? I had collected such news articles for my script Oh yeah! Right! Weren't you working as an assistant director... and then you became an SI using your dad's reputation, right? Ma'am... Listen! Don't vomit all these stories here! Use your script knowledge only for your movies! Don't create unnecessary confusion by dragging it into the investigation Only if you had put your creativity to right use, you'd be director by now You are here because you couldn't do that! Samyukta body was found in a tortured condition after two days she was kidnapped Today marks the second day since Amudha went missing Ma'am if we don't take a quick action then Amudha might face the same plight It will happen Listen! Don't you order me what to do Go, get me a cigarette Make it fast I said, go! It's me, the AC. Round up that area Don't allow the public, especially the media Don't let anyone click photos or take videos I'm on the way Arun, you were spot on! Finally, the SI was right. It happened exactly as he predicted Don't let any news to the media without my permission Okay ma'am 'Samyukta's murder case officer' No sir We don't have any such gift box listed in Samyukta's murder investigation Please do check with her parents once Sir, we didn't find any such gift box Samyukta was kidnapped when she was returning from her hostel Inquire at her hostel and you might get some lead When I was conducting the autopsy... I couldn't control my tears I guess, the killer doesn't know what pain is Black heart! Poor girl, he drilled out her eyes Then broke her teeth and uprooted her hair patch by patch On top of that, he has scarred all over body with knife He did this all while the girl was alive This man is suffering from Antisocial Personality Disorder With aggression and deviant behavior In short a psycho! Completely a psycho! Sir... was she... raped? No rape But... her private parts were... Sir... this is Samyukta's autopsy report Exact same! She has been murdered exactly the same way as Amudha I am sure! Well, sir... do you think we can confirm he is the murderer based on just these facts? Ma'am... someone had left a gift in her name after she had left But I totally forgot about it as I was in shock after hearing what happened to her I got this from Samyukta's hostel What's going on, Lakshmi? I just got roasted by the DCP! Is there any link between Amudha's murder and Samyukta's murder case that was closed? And how? No, sir. Well, that... Come on, Lakshmi! Sir... So according to you, it's a psychopath who is behind these murders If there is no motive or any links to him and the victims... then how do we move this case further? Whom do we doubt? How do we catch him? I have a strong feeling that this case is going to be a big headache Sir, I have an idea but there is a risk involved in it Tell me Sir... In this case, the mark of leaving a gift box after kidnapping the victims... then leaving the corpse in a public place... in a way the killer is doing a self publicity Like how applause and appreciation motivates an artist... Psychos thrive on the attention they get and fear people have on them That's what keeps them going That is what keeps their mind stable And that stable mind is what helps them to plan their murders In order to stop him, we must break his stable mind If no media or news publishes any news about him... and if no gives him the attention, that will distract him He'll get confused His will divert his attention towards another target He will commit a blunder in his plan And at that moment, we'll have the opportunity to nab him! For that, we'll have to keep Amudha's corpse away from everyone Even from her parents Sir, let's try this idea Listen! If the information leaks later, then an SI like you... you don't have to worry the headache will be ours! We'll have to reply to the home minister, CM, media etc. Ma'am the psycho ain't gonna stop with Amudha Unfortunately, we don't have any other clue to approach that psycho So brutally murdered that even the autopsy doctor couldn't control his tears Do you want her parents to see it? Do you think they have the strength to bear it? Arun... there are procedure and ethics to handle a case It would be good for all of us, if we follow it Go meet her parents and inform them Let me talk to the DGP Sir, it is because normal procedure won't work out in this case... I came up with this idea Please sir Don't you judge what will work out or what won't Just obey your orders. Now, go! It won't be Amudha Fine, come let's check once Please don't cry Please come Don't worry Why are we even here? I am not coming I don't have the courage to see If it's indeed our daughter's corpse then please kill me and let me die too Get up, dear No! She isn't here What happened? That's not our daughter Are you sure? I am serious Nothing will happen to our daughter Come, let's go home Sir, did you check properly? That's not our daughter Come on Sir, wasn't it Amudha's body inside? I discussed the points you mentioned with the DGP He has given the permission Sir, then Amudha's corpse? This is a secret mortuary maintained by the government It looks like an ordinary medical warehouse from the outside When we frame the politically supported criminals and finish them off, we bring their corpse here We file an absconding case on them and fake a search on them. One it settles down, we dispose their corpses Mr. Arun, your logic about the psychopath made sense I informed the IG and when we got the permission we shifted Amudha's body at once This place is under Dr. Nandan's responsibility There is no issue in hiding Amudha's corpse If that person is a psycho killer... then he must be arrested before his next attempt Out! Out! Please, come in Come dear Hello sir. I am Das I am Ammu's father She is a little weak in studies Hence, I have put her in this school now I heard that you are quite strict. Please do take care of her You may leave. I'll take care of her Ok dear, see you. Take care Go and sit This model isn't available these days. It has been stopped Such dolls aren't selling well in this shop either Hence, they stopped buying it last year Only one doll is left Come, I'll show you Sir Sir! This type of dolls are imported But since its outdated, no one buys it these days We also think to stop this Dear students, in today's world women's education is quite an important factor A nations progress lies in the way it treats it's women Example the developed countries Amongst the developing nation, India stands first The reason for that is the importance we give to our country's women - You can't even solve a simple sum - Sir... - How will you pass this year? - Sir, it's hurting - Sir! - Tell me You do everything else except studying - Sir!

Right from his childhood... he had a hormone condition that made him look like an very old man So, none of the students could accept him and made him an out cast Christopher! Come here Sophia Mary found some peace knowing Christopher had a friend in Sophie But none of Sophie's friends approved of it Fine, let's eat. Come on Without letting anything affect Christopher... Mary took good care of him Happy birthday to you Thank you, Sophie Without any botheration... She wanted to make Christopher one of the best magician And so Mary started training him At the same time... Christopher started having feelings for Sophie Sophia! Sophie... What is it? Tell me - Sophia... - Awesome! I love you At first Sophie was shocked Sophie! Later she advised him... and tried to make him understand But since all that went in vain... Sophie started moving away from him Christopher, who couldn't accept that fact... became obsessed and pestered Sophie Please, talk to me Sophie When she isn't interested to talk with you, why are you troubling her? Sophia! After my mother, you're the one who cares a lot for me Sophie couldn't stand him anymore Sophia! She took him to the library and made him read genetics related books But why Sophia? She explained him about his hormone condition Don't say like that, Sophia - I am normal - No, Christopher! Don't make me say it! - Sophia please - Read it I don't get it... - I said, read it! - Sophia, please be with me forever Even after that when Christoper was stubborn... Sophie lost her cool and told him that he wasn't fit for marriage She told him that he is impotent She yelled at him, making him understand what that meant! She left warning him from following her in the name of love, marriage or friendship Mom! Mom! That night, he wept talking about his condition and how others hated him, to Mary But his mother, Mary? With great struggle she convinced him that he will become the best magician In order to boost his self esteem and to cover up his drawbacks... she styled him up a bit He headed to school with confidence The sound of 'Impotent! Impotent' It broke Christopher's heart Move! Move! Don't you laugh at me! Ma'am, I'm sorry I shouldn't have spoke to Christopher like that, the other day I had fever the next day and I didn't go to school Mary also made peace with her She asked both of them to become friends once again... and handed her a gift When I was arresting that lady... I could see fear in everyone's eyes over there Few days, after getting released... I heard that both of them passed away in an accident But to think that she is still alive and murdering with the same vengeance in tact it's quite shocking Anyhow... arrest her as soon as possible Or else we'll have to see more victims Hello Emergency!
