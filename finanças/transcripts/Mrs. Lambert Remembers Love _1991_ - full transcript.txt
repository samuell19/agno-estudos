[clock ticking] [wind howling] [dog barking] - [Woman] Jared. Come on, get up doll. Get up, boy, it's time for dinner. Jared, Jared, wash up. [door squeaking] I said get up, Jared, dinner's on the table. - Gram, don't. - [Gram] No lip now. Your goulash'll get cold. - [Jared] Gram, we already had dinner. Why do you keep doing this? [slow melancholy music] [bell ringing] - [Teacher] Have you been going to bed on time, Jared? - Yes, Miss Kingsbury. - Hi. - Hi. Hi, Jared. - Hi, Mr. Brittan. - I hear you've been a sleepyhead lately. - Yes, sir. - Mm-hm. I bet you found a new favorite TV show. - We don't have TV. - Hm, uh, been having bad dreams?

Well, there's your present. - How come you always give me presents on your birthday? - It's an ancient tradition. - How ancient? - It started when you were three years old. - Other people don't do it. - Well, they oughtta. - Wow. Markers. - You like it? - Yeah. [Gram laughing] I got you a present, too. - Did you now? - But we should wait for Clifford. - Well, all right. He'll be along soon. Come on, rise and shine now. - Wait. Please read me a chapter. - Oh Jared, that's for bedtime. This is getting up time. - You didn't read to me last night. You were too tired, remember? - Well, I remember, but I've got a million things to do. - You're right. I should be more like the other kids. Watch cartoons on Saturday mornings. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Slimer and the Ghostbusters. - [chuckles] All right. [gentle music] Kidnapped by Robert Louis Stevenson. I begin my story, the story of my adventure, on a certain morning early in the month of June, the year of grace 1751. When I took the key for the last time out of the door of my father's house. The sun began to shine upon the summit of the hills as I went down the road. - [Mechanic] I can fix it, but it ain't gonna last very long, you know, Mitch. - Hey Mitch. You got a customer. - Thank you. - Welcome. - I'm Mitch Delonreau, and uh, sometimes the customer's queen. - Etta Crue, Social Services Department. It's about Jared Lambert. - Ah well, his grandmother took him on years ago. - Yes, his school informed us of that. The Department, as a matter of course, always beings its investigations with the immediate family. - Uh-huh. - I'd like to hear what you know about Jared's situation. - Well, to tell you the truth, the old lady and I don't get along too good. And I got nothing against the kid, but he ain't exactly keen on me. - We have some reason to believe that Mrs Lambert's health is failing. If it's true, it could put Jared's welfare in jeopardy. - Well, that's where you folks come in, right? I mean, I'm not his father. - No, we realize he's your sister's child, but he will need a home and there's the matter of Mrs Lambert's estate. - Lil never had any money. - We don't know that. We do know that she's a homeowner and that there's no mortgage on the house. - Probably more than half an acre there, wouldn't you say? - Actually, a little more than an acre. ♪♪ Oh, it beats 27.50 at the bakery ♪♪ ♪♪ It's much better made at home, di di di-di di ♪♪ [party horn blowing] ♪♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪♪ Happy Birthday dear Lil ♪♪ Happy Birthday to you - Oh, thank you. - Homemade. - Really?

If they all go out, your wish will come true. - If they all go out, I may go out with them. Oh well, isn't that something. - Now open my present. - All right. Let me see here. - Can I look? - Sure. - Yes, you can look. - Did you wrap this yourself? - Yeah. - Very well wrapped. [chuckling] [gasping] - I copied from the photo album. - Really, isn't this beautiful. - This is you and Grandpa getting married. See, Cliff, you're in here too. - That's me? - Yeah. - You made my nose too big. - Looks life-size to me. - Oh, thank you very much. [giggling] - This is last summer before Dumpsy got hit. Kinda sad, huh? - You have the makings of a great artist. Your father and I have always known that, Ross. - I'm Jared. Ross was my dad. - Well I know that. - I can't remember anybody's name worth a anymore either. Nowadays I just call everybody Mac, except for the ladies. Them I call sweetheart. - Mh-hm. - The last one is you and me. I made that one up. - Well, it's just the best present I've ever received. Thank you. Thank you. - Now open Clifford's present. - Ah, it's nothing, nothing, nothing. - It feels kinda light. [giggles] - [Jared] Dumpsy. - [Lil] Yes. - He was such a nice quiet little dog, wasn't he? At least this one's a little livelier. - Thank you, Clifford. - You guys wanna go for a birthday spin? - You know who I thought of this morning? Gloria Strauss. I haven't seen her in years. Do you feel like um, you know, driving up to Edgemont and visiting her? - I think, Gloria Strauss, I think she moved. Yeah, she's not there anymore. She moved. [TV blaring] [door knocking] Gloria. I bought you some company. [woman gasping] Oh sorry. - Hello, Gloria. - Oh. - It's Lil. You remember my grandson, Jared? - Oh goodness. Hello, dear, it's so nice to see you. - How do they expect anybody to live with all this clutter? Where's your call button? - You'd better chase them out in the hall. The button doesn't work. - You giving these nurses a rough time, Gloria? - What? - Would you go outside and see if you can find somebody to clean up this mess? How are you doing here? - I guess it's all right. I'd much rather be home, of course. [TV blaring] - [Woman] Until these two came aboard. And they've done nothing but annoy me all the way here. [upbeat music] - [Man] Here, you run along home. - Goodbye. - Now if you want to stay healthy you better catch the next coach out of town. And if you miss the next coach you'll be riding out of here in a hearse. - Would you please get in touch with my daughter? I've got to get out of here. I have such business, lots of things to take care of on the outside. They won't let me use the phone, she changed the number. And if you'd ask the nurse, or a doctor or somebody, I'd appreciate it if you got in touch with them. It's very, very important, and there's some things going on-- [slow dramatic music] - It's okay, come on. [engine roaring] - [Woman] Mitch? I've been thinking. Who's gonna get Lil's place when she dies. hm? - What did you do with the TV section? - Nothing. Jared's gonna be the one to get Lil's place when she goes. - Yeah, so? - So? Mitch, Jared's not old enough to inherit anything. I mean, what'll they do with it? - Save it for him, I don't know. - Well, I wanna know, don't you? I mean, maybe you'll get it, as next of kin. Well, just to hold it for him until he's 21. - You don't think you're already thinking anything I ain't thought of, do you? Hey, Jared. - Hi. - How's my little nephew? Watcha doing? Drawing, huh? Uh huh, right. Listen, I came up to see your grandmother 'cause word is she's not doing too good. Is that right? Uh, getting kinda spacey, is she? [laughs] Listen, I know it's a tough thing, kid, but that's what happens when you get old. You know, your brain just sort of, whoop, and wears out. And uh, when you get to where you can't take care of yourself no more, well, that's what nursing homes are for. And once you get used to it, things'll be better for you too. They'll fix you up with a mother and a father. - No. - Jared? What do you want? - Whoa, Lil. I figured you'd at least remember me. See what I mean, Jared? - He said you were going to a nursing home and that I was going to be sent out for adoption. - Over my dead body. - He lying, huh, Gram? - Just go on and git. We have no business with you. - Take it easy, Lil. - Don't you curse here. - Get a hold of yourself, Grandma. You know, you oughtta face it, Lil, you don't know which end is up. You know, his school already blew the whistle. They're sending some social worker out here and she means business. Tomorrow, Lil. That's tomorrow, Lil, and she means business. - Lovely warm breezes, healthy air, cascading waterfalls, beautiful scenery, you name it. Your own land in the heart of California, that's right. But you know, you'll have to act fast. The Phase One lots are almost gone. [window knocking] Yeah. Yeah well, I'd live to give you time to think it over, but the fact is that the special price offer ends today. Uh, well, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll send you a brochure this afternoon. You look at it for a few days and then I'll call you, see what you think. And listen, if you don't tell my boss, I'll extend the special price offer until we speak again. Great. Good bye. - You don't have a boss. - Did you take a bath today? - Why, is one missing? Can I see this recreation center sometime? - Has not been built yet. - So, what about this picture? - That's an artist's impression. - So it's just a bunch of trees? - Also artist's impression. - So what is it, desert? - When you're selling real estate, never use the word desert. What's going on? - You know my uncle Mitch? - Your uncle Mitch, a little. Why? - What do you think of him? - I think he's an SOB. - What does that mean? - He's not my favorite person. - You think he tells the truth? - Every seventh Sunday. No, I don't think he tells the truth. What do you got in mind? - Nothing. Just curious. - Wait a minute. Wanna play some cards? - Can't. Gram wants me home right away. - Hey, wait a minute. You know Lincoln's Gettysburg address? - I didn't know he moved. [Clifford laughing] - No social worker's taking my boy away from me. Do you know where we put your knapsack? - It's in my room. I'm already packed. - You are? - Mrs Kingsbury's been asking about you. And the Principal. I didn't tell them anything. But, is your brain wearing out? - Now stop that foolish talk. I get a little mixed up, that's all. Nobody's taking my boy away from me. [dramatic music] - How'd you like to go visit your cousins? [slow music] - I have cousins? - Mm-hm. Well, they'd be your third cousins, John and Betty. How long has it been since I've seen them? '65? They have a boy called Butch. He's your father's age. He'd be grown now, of course. - Unless he's dead. - Why heavens, no. Least I don't think so. Listen, when we see them, there's no need to mention Mitch and his nonsense. - How long are we gonna stay with them? - Well, we'll see, won't we? Lordy, my eyes. It's past our bedtime. - Can we stay in a motel tonight? - Oh, that'd be fun, huh? - It'll be my first time. Wow, where'd you get all that money? - This is our trust fund for our adventure. And it's gotta last us a long time. And be our secret the whole way, okay? - Okay. - Especially around strangers. Don't let on that you have any money at all, right? Or of course, [laughs] show 'em where it is. Now, I'm gonna put half of it in my satchel. And the other half? - How about my backpack? - No, I don't think so, doll. - My secret pants pocket? - Hey. Good thinking, boy. You's a smart kid. [car horn honking] [car horn honking] - Is there any money in this? - [Clifford] No. - Then why do you go to all the trouble? - I like the conversation. - Whaddya say, Buddy? This swap meet isn't just for you. I got stuff to sell, too. What about that space? - She paid her deposit. She got another 20 minutes. - Well, is it okay if I wait here then? - Help yourself. - Wonder where Lil is. - Maybe got a flat. You got the blue bunny? There's a blue bunny there. - So where do you suppose she is? Here. - Hello. - Hello. I'm Etta Crue, Social Services Department. - Clifford Pepperman. I'm a friend of the family. - Well, there doesn't seem to be anybody home. I knocked on the door and it just opened. - Hm. Well I'm pretty sure they'll be back soon. - Really? I don't know. It looks like they left in a hurry. Or does Mrs Lambert always keep house like this? - Oh no, no no, ma'am. Normally you could eat off her floor. I personally prefer the table. [chuckles] - It would be very helpful if you could tell us where they might have gone. - With all due respect, Miss, uh, Mrs Lambert is quite able to take care of herself. - We're not so sure. - You aren't? Why not? - Well, in the case of the boy's welfare, we don't like to take chances. My department is working with the school board on this case. There is a relative who lives nearby. - Oh yes. Uh, you're talking about Mitch? - [Etta] Yes, Mr. Delonreau. - Yeah. You're not seriously thinking of letting this boy-- - The first thing, Mr. Pepperman, is to find the boy and Mrs Lambert. Let's concentrate on that. - Uh huh. What did you say your name was? - Etta Crue. - Etta Crue. You're with the Red Cross? - No, Social Services. - Ah. - [Jared] I don't feel so good. - Well, I'm not surprised. I don't know what possessed you to eat two whole orders of pancakes. With blueberry syrup. Our turn-off is near here somewhere. - Do you know where the cousins live? - Well, of course I do. I've got a plan. - Where is it? - I believe it's on the kitchen table. Halstead, John. - There's three Halsteads. Alan, Louis, and Raymond. - No John? - Maybe he moved. - Well, one of those could be John and Betty's boy. We used to call him Butch. What are the streets? - Hemingway, Oak, and Orchard. - Orchard. They used to have these beautiful fruit trees. - There's number 7, there it is, right there. - [Lil] Why it looks like they cut down the whole orchard. - Okay. [door bell ringing] - I'll get it. - No you won't. Pick up your toys, straighten your room. - Excuse me, are you a Halstead? - Yes. - Then we're related. I'm Lilian Lambert, first cousin to John Halstead. And this is my grandson, Jared. - We just came to visit. - Tell me, dear, are John and Betty Halstead still in the neighborhood? - I'm afraid not. They're both, they both passed on. Several years ago. - Oh, mercy me. What of? - Old age. I married John's son, Raymond. My name is Laura. - He's called Butch, isn't he? - [laughs] Not anymore. - We thought we'd surprise the cousins. Sure would be nice to see Butch again. - Oh. Well, Ray's picking up our two boys from soccer practice. - Uh huh. - Would you like to come in and say hello? - Oh, that'd be lovely, dear. - Where do you live? - In Santa Maria. - Tracey, these are your cousins, Lil and Jared. Jared looks to be about your age, doesn't he? - Jared's nine. - And Tracy's eight. - Eight and a half. - Tracy, why don't you show Jared your butterflies? - Okay, come on. - Go on, doll. - Come on, they're upstairs. [juicer whirring] - That thing scare the juice out of the lemons, Linda? - It's Laura. - Laura. - So, you must be retired, Lil. - Oh, homemakers never retire. I'm sure you know that. You certainly have a lovely daughter. I think she and Jared could become real pals. How old are your boys? - Younger. They're quite a handful. - Oh, that's wonderful. I just love big families. Thank you. I say the more children the better, don't you think? - Well, I wouldn't go that far. I think two is ideal. Damon, our youngest, was a little accident. - Oh. - How many children did you have? - We only had one, Ross. I lost him soon after my Joe died. - That must have been difficult. [slow music] - To lose your husband is bad enough, God knows, but to lose your child, well, I would have just given it all up right then and there but I had this baby on my hands, 'cause of course, you know, my daughter-in-law died in the crash too. - I'm sorry. So, you raised Jared yourself? - Yes, and I'm still raising him. And when I get done taking care of him, he's gonna take care of me. Right, boy? - Yup. - He's a good boy. - [Clifford] This shot for $150 million. Shucks. - Howdy, Clifford. - [Clifford] Sheriff, play some horse? - Not the way you're shooting. [Clifford laughing] I just dropped by to ask you a couple of questions. - [Clifford] Go ahead. - Well, I was wondering, do you have any idea where Jared and Lil might be? She wasn't at home all last night and her social security check's still in the mailbox. - Well, her social security check is not much of an incentive for her to be home. She probably went away for the weekend. - Yeah, but where would they go? She hasn't been away from that house for more than a day in 20 years. - Then she probably figured it was about time. - Cliff, look, we all know that lately Lil hasn't been all that well, in the, you know. - Well, she could lose 50% of what's up there and still be twice as smart as anybody else around here. Why are we over-reacting? What are you going to do next, call the FBI? - I don't know. I just don't have many choices here. I gotta put Lil and Jared's name on the state list of missing persons. - Oh, you do that and next week Jared's picture will be on every milk carton in the state. - Doing my job. - Yeah, I know. Well, you're going to feel pretty sill if it turns out they were just visiting. - I sure hope that's all it turns out to be. Anyway. - My boy certainly cleaned his plate, didn't he? - [Laura] He even had seconds. - Mm, he's got an appetite like his Dad's. Remember, Butch, how Ross used to out-eat anybody? - Uh no. I wish I had your memory, Lil. But I do remember when Ross whacked my whiffle ball up into our pine tree. Then he shinnied up the trunk like a monkey to get it back. - Oh, you hear that, boy? - Mom, can Jared stay over? - You'll have to ask Jared's grandmother, honey. Where did you plan to stay tonight, Lil? - Oh I just thought we'd find a hotel nearby. Maybe you folks know a cheap one. - Well, several actually. - But of course, you're welcome to stay here. - Oh, it wouldn't be imposing? - Oh, absolutely not. - Oh, that's very kind of you, Butch. Well, that sure was a good dinner, Laura. - Thank you, Lil. - You're a good cook. I sometimes, when I make hamburgers, I serve piccalilli with them. Do you ever make piccalilli? - [Laura] No. - You know, it's corn relish. I'll give you the recipe if you want. 'Course you got to grow your own corn. That's the thing. I mean, there's just no sense in making corn relish with canned corn, or even the frozen. When we made corn I used to say to Joseph, "I'll boil the water, then you pick the corn." I love growing corn. I grow my own herbs too, of course. See, when I make potato salad I use my mother's recipe. But um, she used to put olives in it. You know the kind, the stuffed ones with the little pimento in it. I don't do that anymore 'cause, you know, they say salt isn't good for you. It's not good for the high blood pressure. So uh, now I use the fresh herbs. I use dill, and of course some onion. [slow dramatic music] [clock ticking] Joseph, Joseph, where have you been? Ross has had a high fever. I've been bathing him in ice all night. - [Jared] What? What's wrong? - Huh? Oh, where are we? - At the Halsteads. - Where? - They're our cousins, remember? - The Halsteads? - They're supposed to be John and Betty but they're Ray and Laura. - Oh oh. Oh, oh. Are you sure you wouldn't rather be sleeping in there in the boys' room? - I'm sure. All they talk about is sports stuff. And the girl kills butterflies. - She kills them? - And sticks pins in 'em. - Oh dear. - Yeah, and they think drawing is for sissies. - Hm. Yeah, they don't seem much like kin, do they? Tell you the truth, I don't even remember Butch very much. Don't worry, honey. We'll be out of here first thing in the morning. - But you left your plan on the kitchen table. - That doesn't matter. Jordan was never hard to find. - Who? - Jordan. - Go back to sleep, Gram. We'll figure it out in the morning. [door knocking] - [Clifford] Oh sorry. Good morning. - Good morning. - Is Mitch around? - Who wants to know? - Oh, I'm Clifford Pepperman, a friend of Lil Lambert's. Mitch knows me. - Hey, how's it going uh, Cliff? You bought a Caddy off our lot. It was at least five years ago. - That's right. She's right out front. - So you ain't here about any consumer complaints, huh? - No, no. I'm here because the Sheriff is going to open a missing persons file on your nephew and his grandma. - Whoa. Who says they're missing? - I do. You seen 'em around lately? - Well, yeah, I was uh, up there before work the other day. Sunday, yeah. Mind telling me why you're asking? - Because I'm a friend of theirs. You got any idea why two people would just up and vanish without saying a word? - No idea whatsoever. They never said anything to me about planning any trip. All's I did was pay a call and see how things were going. - And how were things going? - Well, you know, Lil was pretty much her usual self. Ornery. [laughs] I guess the word has gotten out she's going a little soft. - Is that what you spoke about? - Maybe. Ah, I forget the part about what business this is of yours. - Oh, it's simple enough. The lady and her grandson and I are friends. We've been looking out after each other for a long time, while you were keeping yourself as far away as possible. Until last Sunday, of course. - Mr. Pepperman, if he hear anything we'll be sure to let you know. - Much obliged. - Take care, Lil. - Here's a souvenir. - It's a dead butterfly. - It's a keepsake. Say thank you. - I know, Gram. Thanks, Tracy. - Okay, Tracy, stand back. - [Jared] Can we go live in San Francisco? - [Lil] Why would you want to live in a big city like that? - They got these cable cars, see. To take you up the hills. - Where'd you get that? - Tracy. She's been to San Francisco a lot of times. There's these bridges. Let's go there. We can see the Golden Gate Bridge. - Oh, that's a crazy place, doll. That's not for us. No, we're gonna go see Jordan. - Who's Jordan? - It's your father's brother. - Come on, Gram. Dad didn't have a brother. You sure you know who this Jordan is? - Well heavens, yes. I meant to say your grandfather's brother. - And do you remember what we're doing here? - Of course I do. - I wish Clifford was here. - Oh, I know. I'll go get Pa. He's in the stable. Then we'll get the Model T. We'll go in that and I can ride in the rumble seat. I like to ride in the rumble seat. That'll be good. Well, you better put on those stockings of yours, Myrtle, 'cause it's cold as Alaska out here. No, I haven't and neither has he. [slow dramatic music] [muffled voices talking] [footsteps shuffling] [window knocking] - You okay in there, kid? You okay? - Moon shining on the snow. Noah and Dick had their winter coats on. I brushed them in the afternoon. And then they got all froze. - [Man] Excuse me, lady. Your friend here is a little worried about you. - Jared, did you accept a ride from a stranger? - No, come on, Gram. Let's go. - Well, answer me, young man. Did you accept a-- - No. His name's Peter. - Did you have car trouble? I heard you roll in. I thought you'd come knocking. - Did the car break, Gram? Did you come for help? - Well, I just thought maybe Myrtle and Jake would-- - You live around here? - No, we're just visiting. Come on back to the car, Gram. I'm freezing. - Well, would you tell me what you're doing out here without a coat on, for goodness sakes. Get in there. What's the matter with you, boy? - It'll be all right, ma'am. There's a service station down about a half mile and then we go to take you over to the motel. - All right. Here, come here. - Hello? Anybody home? - Come on, you know there ain't. - Just remember, don't touch things. Clifford Pepperman'll have the Sheriff out here faster than you can spit. - [Woman] Oh yeah, let him try. It ain't his place, yet. He ain't even family. What a nice place. Is that a picture of your sister? - Yeah. - Huh? - Let's uh, head back. This is too weird. I got that meeting in an hour anyway. - Oh, what are you talking about? You act as if someone's watching you from a roof or something, huh? - You know, we shouldn't be here anyhow. Let's just mind our own business for a change, huh? - [Woman] Well, I want what's the best for both of us. - Excuse me. Where is this place? - Kensington. It's up north near San Francisco. - It is? That's where I wanna live. - San Francisco, yeah. But that Meadowlark place is only for old folks. Old folks with bucks. - They don't allow kids? - What kid would want to live with a bunch of old people? - Can I have this magazine? - Sure. [car horn honking] - Thanks. - Normally the school would not be involved in a custody case. But in a town this size you get involved. We've had our eye on Jared's situation for a long time. - Not as long as I have, and I think they look pretty good. Well, maybe Lil gets forgetful once in a while, but it happens to everybody. It'll happen to you some day too. - Well, I think it's a little more serious than that, Mr. Pepperman. - What do you mean? - Well, of course this is just a preliminary meeting. The actual determination will be made when Mrs Lambert is present. - And just what are they going to determine? - Parental fitness. - Sounds like a disease. - Please, Mr. Pepperman. - Naturally our first step in these matters would be to turn to the family. - Well, it's true we haven't been close enough in the past. But nobody can deny that I am the boy's only blood relation. Of course, I need to give this a lot of thought. I mean, I'd need to know exactly what the whole deal here is. - Yeah, I imagine you would have to know exactly what the whole deal is. - You know, you're making a lot of noise like you got somebody else in mind? You gonna adopt the kid, are you, hm? - No, no, I'm not. I don't know anything about kids. Besides, I got my business. You don't know anything about kids either. - I know more than you do. - You don't know anything about-- - You know, I don't know what he's doing here anyway. - Please, gentlemen, please, please. Gentlemen, please. Let's try and work together on this and make some sense out of it. - [sighs] What's the sense of us sitting around planning their future when we don't even know where the they are? - Thank you very much. - All right. - Goodbye. - Bye now. [women chatting] - [Jared] I got you something. - We have to make our money last. - Didn't cost much. [sobbing] It'll help you, don't be sad. [slow music] - I'm not, boy. I'm laughing. - That's not what sleeves are for. - Well, my hanky's dirty. We're gonna have to do our laundry pretty soon, aren't we, doll? - Maybe Jordan has a washer. - Maybe so. [car horn honking] My, don't things change. - You remember this place, Gram? - It's coming back to me now, don't you worry. - I'm still hungry. - Hush now. I'll fix you something in a minute. - No more peanut butter crackers. - Hush, I said. Jordan used to drive this big touring bus. Somebody at the bus station's gonna remember him. - Gram, I'm tired. - Go sit down on that bench. Stop whining. [video game beeping] - [Clem] Psst. Hi. I'm Clem. What's your name? - Jared Lambert. - [Clem] Nice to meet you, Jared Lambert. - Um, I'm looking for Jordan Lambert. He used to work here. He was a bus driver. - Never heard of him. Sorry. - Could we ask somebody who's been here longer than you have? - Sure. Hey, Billy. I could use you up front. Would you wait over there for a minute, lady? - There's a real neat video game but it's in the other room. - What is it? - Wanna come see? - I'd better go tell my grandmother. - No, it'll just take a minute. Come on. [thudding] [Clem yelling] - Dirty louse. You got your hand off of that boy. What are you doing, talking to a stranger like that? - Gram. - How many times have I talked to you about that, huh? What's the matter with you? You creep. Did you see that? - You looking for a former employee? - Uh, yes. Jordan Lambert. He used to drive a bus here. - I've been here 20 years. You sure he drove for us? - Yes. He drove the bus that went right through town, and on up to Modesto, Stockton, even Sacramento. - Maybe you are thinking about a stop up Modesto way. Like Salida? - Salida. - Okay, but this is Salinas. You're only about 100 miles off. Sorry, ma'am. [slow music] - 100 miles? You got the wrong town. - You watch your mouth, boy. - And I bet Jordan died 10 years ago. - Don't you get smart with me. - You don't know where you're going. You don't know which end is up. [dramatic music] - Jared. Jared. Jared! Jared! Jared! Jared, I'm sorry. [truck horn honking] - Gram! Gramma, are you okay? You'll be good as new. - She walked right in front of the truck. - Hey, lady, you gotta watch where you're walking. I did all I could. - Must be in shock. Let's get her to the hospital. - She's okay. Aren't you, Gram? Gram, are you in shock? They want to take you to the hospital. - Lordy, no, I'm fine. I'm all right, for heaven's sake. But our luggage isn't. You can't lock that car, you know. - We'll get the luggage. Go on in. You folks are gonna love this place. - Kinda swanky, isn't it? - Her fault or not, old ladies clean up in court. - [Jared] How come those guys are paying for our room? - It's the least they could've done. They practically killed me. Look at that bed. - There's a tub in here with claws. Want me to run you a bath? Aren't you hungry? [slow music] Maybe we're doing something wrong. Have you ever been to one of these breakfast in bed places before? - No. But if I lay here much longer, I'm gonna get bedsores. [mid-tempo music] - [Jared] Gram, the mechanic said this car wasn't going to last much longer. He didn't think the engine would even get us to Salida. - [Lil] Well, maybe we won't go to Salida. - [Jared] I'm gonna go by the water. - Go on, go. Stay where I can see ya. [gentle upbeat music] - Excuse me, lady, don't you have the wrong house? - Hello. - What uh, what do you think you're doing here? - Oh, just getting a little rest. - Well, you must be cold. - Why, do you think this is too flimsy? - Do you live around here? - Oh, heavens no. We just came for the water. Joseph and I and our son, Ross. They're down there on the beach somewhere. Ross just hates the water but he's got to learn how to swim. - Learn to swim? - Hm. - This time of year? - Well, it's high time, don't you think? He's going on 10 years old. He oughtta know how to swim. - Wait a minute. You mean to tell us your husband's down there with a kid, in the water? - No, my husband's dead. I remember that. - George, why don't you go in and make a phone call, and I'll talk to the lady. When you come out, bring a blanket. - Okay. - I'm Lil Lambert. - And I'm Katherine. - Hello. - Everything's going to be just fine. - Oh, I doubt that very much. - An old lady. Very confused. Like she wandered away from a nursing home or something. What happened? - A little boy came for her. She went away with him. - Uh, see anybody you know? Well, we might have some good news. - You've located them? - Not yet. But two people fitting their description were spotted up near Monterey Beach. I contacted the police in the area and gave them Lil's license plate number, so won't be long now. - What kind of shape were they in? Were they all right? - As far as I know, yeah. We'll find out when they get back. Be good to have 'em home, huh? Yeah. And then what? [thunder rumbling] - Didn't we leave our car right here? Where is it? - Where's our car? - Oh no. [slow music] - The cops much have towed it. Never mind, they'll get theirs in the hereafter, right? It's okay. Now we don't have to spend more money on it. - I want to go home. - Home? - I want to eat at my own table and sleep in my own bed. - We'll stay someplace neat tonight. Look, I got the rest of the trust fund. - I haven't been doing right by you, boy. We gotta go back where we belong. - We can't. The social worker. - What choice have we got? Where else are we supposed to live? - Have you considered a retirement community? [laughing] What's funny? You want to end up in Milford Manor, just like Mrs Strauss? - No, I want to end up in heaven, drinking a beer with your Daddy. And I'm not going to be able to face him if I've left you with no place to go. - You want to go back just to die? - Now listen, doll. We gotta face facts. You're gonna outlive your Gramma no matter where we go. And I want to see you settled with two fine people back where we live. - That's adoption. You said over your dead body. - Don't fight me, boy. I need your help. [door knocking] - [Etta] Hello. My name is Etta Crue. May I come in? - I guess. Mitch? Hi, I'm Darlene. - [Etta] Sorry to disturb your afternoon. - Lil, huh? - She and Jared were seen yesterday near Monterey State Beach. She's not functioning very well. - We sure are worried about the boy. I mean, he's such a nice kid. - Yes. - We want to do all we can to help, being Mitch's family and all. - Mr. Delonreau, have you given much thought to your nephew's predicament? - Night and day. Me and my wife here, we've looked at this from just about every angle. - Well, it's a big responsibility raising a boy. - Well, as we see it, the only problem is we just don't have room here for the kid. But I guess whoever's gonna take care of Jared will probably have to move into Lil's house, 'cause I think he should stay where he's comfortable. Continuity, you know. - Yes. - Of course, moving ain't cheap these days. - Yeah, well there's state money for things like that, I mean, isn't there? Foster fees and things? - Yes, certainly. We'll discuss all that when it's appropriate. [train horn honking] - I'll go buy the tickets. - Well, you don't know which ones to get. - Do so. - Well then, let me give you some money. - Hang on to your money. We're going to need it. - Well, I know. - No lip now. When's the next train to San Francisco? - Excuse me. - San Francisco. - The commuter leaves at 4:34 a.m., arrives San Francisco at 9:05. Fare's $25.50 one way. - Two, please. - And you've still got some change coming. Who's traveling with you? Well, listen son. The train only goes as far as Oakland, but there's a bus waiting right there that'll take you all the way into San Francisco. Got that? That's awful early for you and your Grandma to be running around, isn't it? - No, we do it all the time. I got the tickets, Gram. - Hm? Oh well, I guess I should be glad you're so grown up all of a sudden. - You don't have to take care of me anymore. Nobody does. - Don't be silly. I've got to find the restroom. I wonder where it is. - It's my turn to take care of you now. Like you always said I would, right? - Right, right. I wonder where the ladies room is. - Over there, Gram. - [Lil] Oh, right you are. Thanks, boy. - [Jared] No hurry, Gram. We're gonna be here for hours. - [Clerk] The 4.34 train to San Francisco will be arriving in three minutes on track one. - Oh. - [Clerk] The 4.34 to San Francisco will be arriving in three minutes on track number one. - [Lil] What? - Listen, Gram, we're going to a new home near San Francisco. Look, they got better places to live up here. You gotta pay, but it's worth it. It'll be much nicer than a nursing home. You can go outside, play games. - I just want to get home. - If we pay extra, I think I can stay too. And Clifford can come visit. I got it all figured out. [train horn honking] - Excuse me, I, I seem to have lost my boy. I was traveling with my grandson, Jared. - Grandma, it's me. I'm Jared. I got us here and I'm going to take care of you now. - No, no, oh no. - What else are we going to do, Gram? Our cousins don't want us and Jordan's probably dead. We need our own place, Gram. And I've found it. [train rattling] - Okay. - Come on, let's get our bags. [mid-tempo music] - This sure isn't Santa Maria. - It ain't Beverly Hills, either. - Hey, just like in the magazine. Let's go here. [tram bell ringing] Does this go to Meadowlark Estates? - No, Fisherman's Wharf. - What's the fare? - 15 cents for you, a dollar for the boy. - What a racket. - [Jared] Isn't it great? - That it is, doll, that it is. What in heaven's name did, our trust fund. - Ssh. It's safe. I got it. - You've got it? Well give it to me. - No. You said I could keep it. You might lose it. - How am I supposed to get us home with $3 in my purse? - That's all you have left? We'd better have enough for Meadowlark Estates. - Let me see that money. - Gram, strangers. - Now. - You can see it, but we're not spending it. - Just give it to me. - I know what I'm doing. [gasping] - Jared. [tram brakes screeching] [car brakes screeching] - [Man] You see that? - I got the money, Gram. Are you okay? - Yes, doll. I'm all right. - I got our money back, Gram. You can keep it if you want it. - That's good, doll. [upbeat music] - [TV Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Jose Condida's Lambada Hour. Tonight, our champions are going to dance against two contestants from Santa Maria - Sweet Jesus. I've died and gone to hell. Hello. Hello, help. Where am I? - Mrs Lambert. Did you push the wrong button? - What kind of dope have you got me on? And where's my grandson? - [Nurse] Jared. - Feeling better, Gram? - It's hard to tell. They got me on some kind of dope and I don't know if I'm coming and going. Of course, what else is new? - I made this for you. - Another masterpiece. You behaving yourself? - [Nurse] He's wonderful. Did portraits for all the nurses on duty. - I get you're having a high old time, huh? - I'm ready to go home. - Are you, boy? So am I. - Jared. [upbeat music] Hey, yah. I was here about an hour ago but they caught me at the front desk and made me sign 3,000 papers. - [laughs] Whoa. - Where's Grandma? [slow music] - Well, hallelujah. - Jared, wait outside for a couple of minutes. I want to talk to your Grandma alone, okay? - Okay. - What the hell have you done to yourself, Lil? - Oh, I took a spill, messed up my leg. - It's your hip, isn't it? - Yeah. They say they can pin it back together good as new. But what good is that when my brains are all scrambled? - Never mind that. Let's just get you home. - That's not home I'm going to. - Well, you may have to stay at my place for a little while until you get on your feet again. - Don't coddle me, Clifford. I was going soft anyway. Now I'm useless as an old orange peel. - I'm not going to listen to this. - Soon as we get out of here, I'm going to move into Milford Manor. Get myself a bed right next to Gloria. Just help me with the boy, will ya? - What do you think I'm doing here? I'm going to help both of you. - Like always. - Only this time, I'm going to do it right. Lil, will you marry me? [Lil laughing] What are you laughing about? I should have asked you years ago. - Clifford Otis Pepperman. - Better late than never. What do you say, Lil? Will you marry me? - I mean, adopting the boy is one thing. But marrying me. - Well, it's the only way I'll be able to adopt him. Or take care of you. Please? Jared. - Seems your grandma isn't the only crazy one around here. - Think you can spare this boy for a couple of hours? I'm going to need his help. - Okay. - You stay there. We'll be right back. [slow music] - Isn't that a lovely gown? - Oh, it is. Thank you so much for letting me borrow it. - This is the very first wedding for orthopedics. Where are you going on your honeymoon? - Into surgery, dear. I thought you knew that. - I got your veil, Gram. - You did? - I made it out of bandages and stuff. - You did? Oh, the crowning touch. How do I look? - Good. - Yeah? Now listen. Don't let me mess up this wedding, huh? - Okay, but remember, you're marrying Clifford. Not Joseph, not Ross, and not me. - Clifford, Clifford. I'm marrying Clifford. I'm marrying Clifford. Clifford, Clifford. Okay. I got it. I got it. [gentle music] - Children of God, we come together in His presence to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony. Because this man and this woman have found in one another the partner with whom they wish to go with God. May they be so joined. The ring, please. - Put it on? - Yes. - May this ring symbolize the bond between you both and the faith with which you'll keep to one another and to God. Do you, Clifford Otis Pepperman, take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife? - I do. - Well, in that case, so do I. [laughs] - Lilliam Cox Lambert, I therefore assume you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband. - Oh, gracious, yes. - I now pronounce you man and wife. [crowd applauding and cheering] [upbeat classical music] - Well, maybe we should let the newlyweds have a little time to themselves. - Oh, alone at last. Except for you, of course. - [laughs] Very funny. The Reverend certainly was religious, wasn't he? - Well, they're supposed to be, Clifford. That's why they call them reverends. - [laughs] How did you know my name was Clifford? [laughing] - [Lil] As soon as you said my name was Lil, I knew your name was Clifford. - You're my wife now. You know what that means? - What? - The next time you decide to go running out you gotta take me along with you. - I promise. - Excuse me for interrupting you, but I'm about to go off-duty and there's some information I'm required to give you. Your surgery's been scheduled for 8 a.m. tomorrow. You'll be in the operating room for about two hours. Pinning your hip is a routine operation. Then you'll come out, go into the recovery room, and you'll be there about an hour before you come back here to your own room. Do you have any questions? - No, thank you very much. - Clifford, take the boy out tonight, huh? And tomorrow, you know, do something special with him so he gets his mind off his old grandma. - I love you, Lil. - I love you, too. [ambient piano music] - Well, Jared, you got yourself a couple of relics. - What are relics? - Very old objects. - I don't care if you're the oldest couple in the world. You're not, are you? - So, how's everything going there, folks? Everything okay? - Fine thanks, terrific. We're having a little wedding celebration. - Ah. Bachelor party? - No, no. I'm the groom. - Ah. Then where's the bride? - She's in the hospital. - Ah. Enjoy. - Okay dear, that last shot was to prepare you for the anesthesia. - Okay. - I'll tape your ring so you don't have to take it off. - Oh, thank you. I appreciate that. [slow music] Out of the night that covers me. Black as the pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be, for my unconquerable soul. Matters not how straight the gate, how charged with punishment the scroll. I am the master of my fate. I am the captain of my soul. [machines beeping] - [Nurse] Doctor. - Are you my father now? - You bet I am. I'm also your step-grandfather-in-law, if you want to get technical about it. - Does this mean you're going to live with us now? - Oh, I don't know. I haven't had time to think about it. Too many things have been happening. - Gram doesn't like to let on, but she loves to play cards. - You play chess? - No, do you? - Yeah. I once played 58 guys simultaneously blindfolded. I lost to all of them. It was quite an upset. [machines beeping] - [Doctor] A little more suction here. - [Nurse] Suction. - [Doctor] Joanne, keep that retractor in there. [machine alarm beeping] Oxygen. That's fine. [slow jazz music] - [Doctor] Please, have a seat. - It's all right. I can hear standing up. - Mr. Pepperman, I'm sorry to inform you that your wife died during surgery. We did everything we could, but she simply wasn't strong enough. Please accept my condolences and those of the entire staff. - I'm all right, I'm all right. It's okay. God, I thought I'd be ready if this-- - Would you like some privacy? - No, no, no. There's too much to do, arrangements. She'll have to come home. - If you like, we can perform an autopsy to determine whether or not it was the anesthesia or complications. - No, thank you. No autopsy. She wanted to go. She wanted to go. Was it painful? - No, not at all. She just, she just let go. - She just. [slow music] Well, thank you, Doctor. - Can I get you anything or walk out with you? - No, no, I'm perfectly fine. Thank you very much. Thank you. I'm sorry, thank you. - [Doctor] You take care, Mr. Pepperman. - [Clifford] Yes sir, thank you. [lift door sliding] - [Girl] Come on, come on. - Hey. Do you know Lincoln's Gettysburg address? We can't run away from this one, Jared. And we don't have to pretend that we're not sad. We both loved your grandmother and we're going to miss her a lot. That's the way it is. Look, say something, will you? Say something, cry or something. - I don't want to cry. I want to go home. - Good idea. Let's go home. [slow music] - [Jared] What's going to happen to me? Where will I live? - With me, of course. I'm your grandfather now, remember? We're a family. - But what if the same thing happens to you? - Tell you what, make a deal with you. I'll stick around until you're old enough to take care of yourself. That a deal? - Okay. But don't forget. - I won't forget.
