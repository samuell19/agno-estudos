( silence ) ( singing quietly ) ( knocking ) Is your mom in ? She's sleeping. Tell her I have to talk to her. Maybe I can wake her... Mama. Who is it ? Someone who wants to talk to you. Lia, it's me. Good evening. Here you are. Wait, I'll get the money. It's ten million lira. I'll give you the other ten tomorrow, okay ? Remember, I'll be waiting tomorrow. Okay. ( loud pop music playing ) Minica ! Minica ! Lower the music ! How does this work ? I'm going upstairs. ( music getting louder ) ( singing ) What is it ? How much is it ? Ten. It was supposed to be twenty. She'll bring the rest tomorrow. This way we'll go broke. What do you want me to do ? How did it go ? Badly, they followed me from the market all the way to Lia's house. Who were they ? Ten from yesterday and ten from today, Mimmo gave it to me. How come only ten today ? She only had ten, she'll give me the rest tomorrow. Don't worry, Angela, nothing will happen. Are you ready ? I reserved for 10:00, we're already late. You can seal this one. I'll prepare the next one. How many were there ? Two of 250 grams and three half kilos. Wasn't it three of 250 grams and two half kilos ? I'm telling you it was two of 250 and three half kilos. Nineteen... Will you be much longer ? No, we're almost done. I'll have them come pick up ? - Yes. Mom, there are people down here. I'm coming. Signor Ligreci, sorry I kept you waiting. I couldn't find the right size. All set, two of 250, as agreed. Minica, Minica. Give me a bag for Signor Ligreci. Should I pay now ? That's not necessary. We'll put it on your tab. Goodbye, say hello to your wife. I'm Luigi, I'd like a pair of shoes. For 250 or 50 ? I'd like the 50, because the 250... Angela, It's Lia, I need a pair of shoes one for 250,000 lira and one 50... How do they fit ? Great. I'll ring them up. Did Angelo come ? He took a 50 ? A 250. All set. See you in an hour. This is for you, Signor Ligreci. Let's hurry up, we're short on time. Did you check it ? It's fine. When will you return ? In four or five days. We have to go to Florence, Milan... If I can, I'll stop in Venice. With all those dogs in the airports... Almost done ? Ready. Then I'm off. It's best if I don't call you, but don't worry. Ciao, Angela. Ciao. Milan, Florence, see ? This time we really outdid ourselves. Beautiful things ! Amazing, good job. I want this, it's mine. You want it ? I've got the best piece, right ? Absolutely. Stupendous. That's true, a beautiful necklace. This one's amazing. What are you doing ? Take it off. Take it off. It's beautiful. It doesn't suit you. It really doesn't suit you. I agree. Look what I brought you. Look at this ring, put it on. Like a queen ! Beautiful. Always rings, Saro ? We'll get good money for these. ( phone ringing ) Good evening, it's Santangelo. I need three pairs of shoes, the 250.000 lira kind. But the leather has to be good, not like the ones from last time. Don't say these things to me. If you don't like them, you can take your business elsewhere. I need to talk to your husband. He's not here, he left. I can't wait. You gotta send me someone. I'll see what we can do, I'll talk to you later. Can you show us what's in the bag ? Take it easy. We'll do it. For what reason ? A regular control. There's nothing. Sorry. How much do I owe you ? Nothing, go ahead. Can you believe those guys ! What do you think ? I say it's good. Unload it here, I'll take it away later. Masino ? Are you listening to me ? I'm telling you to lay low and calm. Don't let anyone see you around. Palermo isn't a comfortable city. Saro really cares about you, so don't disgrace him. Can I leave my suitcases here ? Yes, no one will touch them. Okay ? Okay. I'll be back later. Watch out. Don't worry. Good evening. Toto ! This is a friend of mine. You're in Palermo ? Yes, got back this morning. You were gone ? In northern Italy. Came here for work ? Yes, with Saro. In his store ? If you need anything I'm available. Come visit us. Nice to meet you. Can I have a kilo of oranges ? A kilo ? Yes. That's all. How much is it ? Are 2 1/2 kilos okay ? Yes, how much is it ? 2,000 lira. I'll pay. You'll pay ? Gimme. Goodbye. Who is that ? That's Masino Santalucia from Kalsa. You don't know him ? Goodbye. Bongiorno. Bongiorno. How come you came ? Who'd you expect to come ? I didn't know you were coming. This isn't a job for a woman. Why, you're not satisfied ? I didn't say that. Well, then ? I wouldn't send my wife to do these tasks. You want the stuff or you wanna waste more time ? Of course I want it. Here. One and one, as agreed. The money, tomorrow at the store. Arrivederci. Arrivederci. Say hello to your husband. Certainly. See you. This is size 46, it should fit you fine. Do you have these in brown ? No. When will the owner be back ? I don't know. How do these fit ? I don't like them. They're kind of stiff. Bongiorno. Bongiorno. What did you come here for ? I have an appointment. I was trying on shoes in the meantime. You work here ? Actually, it's my store. Isn't it Saro Parlagreco's store ? I'm Saro's wife. Ah, I see. Masino Santalucia, a friend of Saro's. Pleased to meet you. Pleased to meet you. Did you need help ? I wanted to see those white shoes with the buckle. I'll get them. Were the oranges good ? Very good, thanks. Are these okay ? How's business going ? Can't complain. That's good. Angela. Ciao. Ciao. Masino ! You met my wife ? Yes, just now. This is Masino Santalucia. Didn't I tell you a friend was coming to work here ? He's the friend ? It's him. Stay here, we're going upstairs, I don't want to be disturbed. Upstairs we can talk better. Santino's like that, he doesn't want problems. He doesn't want money, but he does want the stuff. A kilo every month, that's what we pay him, and he let's us work in peace. It's safe to work here, but we always have to be careful. My cousin Mimmo, he works with us. This is Masino, uncle Vincenzo's nephew. I was saying... With robberies, you get the gun, say "hands up", and if it works, it works. If not, they arrest you, end of the film. Not with this stuff, you have to know it well. You have to know who you buy it from and who you sell it to. It works for me, they make it work for me. But if you mess up, they'll put your feet where your head is. If you think about all these troubles, you won't work anymore. Alright, Mimmo. How are the accounts ? Bad... Bongiorno, Senora. Bongiorno. Is your husband in ? Who would you be ? Santino Bonanno. Sorry, I wasn't expecting you. Follow me. Santino, what a surprise ! Angela, get out of here. You were looking for me. I wanted you to meet Masino. Wouldn't want you to see new faces and not know who they are. He's Masino. Masino Santalucia. Masion Santalucia. You're Vincenzo Santalucia's son ? Yes. He came back home. Pleased to meet you. The pleasure's mine. He's a good kid, he works with me. I heard he was a bit of a hot-head. All nonsense. You like women too, right ? Who doesn't ? He's young. His blood boils. Anyway... I mainly came here for the stuff. Wait, excuse me. These are hard times, my stuff is all out now. Things are tight for me. Then give me the money. I have set collection days, you have to give me time. Is tomorrow morning fine ? I'll send Masino. Fine with me, I'll be waiting. I always wait. Guys, I'm leaving. I'll walk you out. Thanks for the surprise. The stuff they sent us this time is no good. What the fuck are you saying ? Look at it. You can even feel it. Scoundrels. Now what ? We'll go back. We risk even more going back and forth... We can't muddy our reputation in Palermo. If we got scammed... It's no good. It's cut. We can't do anything about it. We can stick it to that swine Santangelo. Saro? Huh ? I'm tired. What's wrong ? I want to get out of here, take a break. Fine... we'll go to my uncle's in New York. What uncle, Saro ! I do want to take a trip and go meet relatives. We'll go on a cruise, for a month. You don't understand. What's there to understand ? I want a change, I'm tired of this. What's missing ? Nothing's missing, at all. I want to go away for a bit, take a break. Yes, but what does that mean ? Masino. Yes. Will you do me a favor ? With pleasure. Will you help me with these boxes ? You don't mind, right ? No, it's my pleasure. Thank you. It's too messy. One of these days, it'll all fall on our heads. That would be a disaster. Anyways, you don't have to worry about a thing, I'm here now. All right ? Yes, Thank you. You're welcome. At your service. Check over these accounts, I don't understand a thing. They place orders, then they change them... I do the accounts my way, then they change... May I ? Good morning. Good morning, Saro. I came to tell you something. I can't give you all the money. Half now, half at the end of the month. The stuff's no good anyway, it's not selling well. You cut it with too much trash. ( laughing ) Santangelo, sit down, I gotta talk to you. The stuff we gave you was exceptional, you even fattened up. Bring me the money tomorrow. I need a few days' time. Your time has run out. Tomorrow, the money. Wait, let's do this. Tomorrow at 3 he'll bring me the money, all of it. And we'll be friends like before. Okay, as you say. What a nice necklace ! He sure spends his money. Fine, see you tomorrow at 3 for the money. Good-bye. Good evening, how are you ? Not bad... Still working ? I do what I can. ( speaking Italian ) Folks, closing time. Mom, do I shut it off ? No. ( laughing ) Why are you laughing, Ma'am ? You don't like this music ? It's horrible ! It's club music. I don't like it. Last time you went dancing ? Dancing... at least five years ago. Five years ? We only went a few times, Saro's doesn't really like to. What did you dance five years ago ? The Charleston ? ( laughing ) Can you do the Charleston ? You like him, right ? You laugh, you joke. Think I didn't notice the way you look at him ? Good morning Ma'am, may I ? I was talking to my wife. Paolino, this situation at Mazara isn't working out. What's the problem ? I'm tired of it. There is a problem. I'll assume the responsibilities. Saro is busy. He's not coming ? He'll be up in a few minutes. Look at yourself ! Sorry, I didn't notice, you know how much I care about my looks. Buy a new shirt. I have enough clothing. Alright, we know. So this money in my pocket, really... Angelo will you go see ? How's it going ? All is well. You look good. So do you. ( chatting in Italian ) There are no more of the 50. I'll bring it right down to you. We're talking about important things. What are you doing ? She bothers me, always talking, always getting involved. Who is she ? Saro's wife ! I know, but she's always in the way. That's his wife, he can do as he pleases. Since when does a woman get involved in her husband's business ? If he doesn't mind, he must have his reasons. She's a woman... she can do deliveries and won't be stopped. You have no idea, there are some delicate situations. Don't think about it, be nice, she'll be happy and won't bug us. Plus you know, women, when they get left out, they cling to you. Saro. Heh? Watch out for that Masino. What do you mean ? He's too cocky. I don't know how much we can talk when he's around. He's a good kid, I want to help him out. You know who his father was, right ? You know what he did up north ? What'd he do ? He fucked the wife of that pig ? That's nothing ? Plus he deserved it. He wanted to kill him so he shot him. He's young ! His blood pumps, you would've done the same at his age. I was his age once, but I never did that.... Anyway Masino is my business, he's here and works with us. The end. Okay. Good morning, Signora Parlagreco, this is Anna. Cute, huh ? My girlfriend. I have to go upstairs, wait for me ? Leaving me here alone ? Wait here. Hurry up. Angela. I'm going out. Where are you going ? The delivery for Gentile. It's for tomorrow ! I'll go now, I want to go out. Hurry back, I'll wait for you. She seemed nervous. Everything okay ? She looked a little nervous. Just your impression. I always get bad impressions. "Millions of individuals "work, produce... "and save money in spite "of everything... "everything we... "devise to trouble... "to trouble them, "obstruct them, "discourage them. "Natural vocation "incites them, "not only... the thirst... for money." Your vision will be blurry for a few hours. Are you driving ? I'll drive. Thanks. "Millions of individuals "produce, invest "and save money... "They work. "In spite of everything we do "to obstruct them, discourage them..." We who ? Who's this "we" ? How should I know ? But it's not the thirst for money. Maybe it's this: even if they obstruct them... Don't think about it. That delinquent blinded me. Lawyers and doctors were made to fuck people over. Then we'd better stay home tonight. No, we'll go out, I just can't see anything right now. How many are there ? Three. Exactly ! And now ? Four. Now how many are there ? Two. So you can see ! It's getting better. Today was a particularly calm day. Frighteningly calm. Tonight I have some business at Brancaccio, I'll have Masino take you, I'll be here with Mimmo. Can't I take a taxi ? I said go with Masino. Fine, whatever you say. Couldn't we have spent a little more time together ? I can't tonight. See you tomorrow. You like this place ? Kind of. Look at me for a second. Look at me. What did you bring me here for ? What happened ? Nothing. Are you sure ? Yes, I'm fine. I love you, you know that, right ? ( murmuring ) I have to go. What's wrong ? Nothing. Will you give me a ride ? Leave me alone, I have to go. Come here. Will you give me a ride ? Angela, it's Masino. Ciao. I didn't tell your husband about what happened at the port. What would you have told him ? That you wanted me. That you were afraid, but you wanted me. Will you do me a favor ? No. Don't call here again. Listen. Saro's going to Milan tomorrow. I told him I'd stay here for that Santangelo mess. You know I'm staying for you. I don't know anything and I don't want to know anything. Him: "I didn't tell your husband about what happened at the port..." You know I like you and I know you like me. What's the problem ? Why are you being a liar ? Why are you lying to yourself ? Her: "Don't call here again." Good Anfuso, nice job. How long will this take ? Two minutes. I have to do an important thing. It's so late ! I'll have Mimmo take you home. Good evening, Saro. Sorry, I'm a few hours late. Sit down, Santangelo. Consider this your payment. Consider this a handout, know why ? The stuff's not selling. Good. I shouldn't even give you this money, because you're worthless. You're a piece of shit ! What the fuck did you do ? Don't be a pain in the ass. He did good. Let's get him out of here. We'll wrap him up. He won't fit in my car. Masino, the car ? Should we take a taxi ? There are some garbage bags over there. Angela, we need some tape. We'll go dump him off and then we'll be back. Turn him over. Put some here. So heavy ! He's a buffalo ! Son of a bitch ! We need another bag. Wait. He's making me sweat more now than when he was alive ! ( clicking ) I have to go. Last night was great. You could've slept over though. Right ! As it was all hell broke loose ! I told him I went to my sister's because she fought with her husband. See you in an hour at my house, okay ? Fine. Leave the door open, so I don't have to ring. What are we doing ? What do you want from me ? I dreamt of you last night. What was I doing ? You were caressing me, then you got undressed and got on top of me. What is it ? Why are you silent ? Saro's in, tomorrow at your place. Hello, Saro ? Mimmo, tell me. I'm going home. They gave Paolino the full service at the barber's, beard, shampoo and hair. I'm telling you, listen up: I think he wants to change jobs, he wants to be a singer, he has a great voice. Come over and we'll talk about it. I'll be waiting. Who should we start with ? With Saro. He's the main pillar of the organization. He does it all, with his wife Angela's help. A beautiful lady... Take photos and write that we are honest people ! His wife helps him with contacts. What kind of contacts ? Business, drugs, money contacts. Then there's Mimmo. Saro's cousin, the organization's accountant. He takes care of paying their gangsters. There's another guy, a whole different subject: Masino Santalucia. AKA "the shark". What about this subject ? "The shark" because he likes the boss' women. Masino is Saro's right hand, his godson. Then there's a retired guy, Salvo Ligreci... So, only shoes ? Only shoes. For men, women, and children. You're the brain behind a criminal organization. I've always made an honest living. What criminal actions ? Why do you, Signor Ligreci Giuseppe, always go to Milan ? Nothing else to tell me ? Yes, one thing. If possible, I'd like to go home. My home and my store, that is my life. Flawless. What's your relationship with Signora Parlagreco ? What do you think of her ? We finally meet. So beautiful and so talked about in the Mobile Unit office. I'm not in the mood for compliments. Let's get to the point, my daughter's waiting for me. If I were you, I wouldn't be in such a hurry. You are implicated in international drug traffic and mafia related associations. I don't know what you're talking about. I work at the store all day, I don't have time to waste. If you could please hurry, my daughter is waiting for me. I suggest you change your attitude, because it's all against you. I have nothing else to say to you. Come with us. Good morning, dear Signora. How's it going ? You seem a bit down. If we get things straight you can go home. I'm going to let you hear something that might interest you. Listen... ...see you in an hour at my house. Hurry up. Fine. Leave the door open, so I don't have to ring. Do you know who this man is ? Yes, I know. We arrested him at the store. Masino's got nothing to do with it, he was there for me. Keep my husband out of this story. As you wish. But this is not the point. I'm the only one who has these calls. These calls are hot. If you tell us who the providers are, who supplies them and what connection they have with your husband, I assure you, I'll get rid of these calls. Agreed ? Mr Imparato sir, if you think I'd get others arrested to save myself, you don't know me at all. You're wasting your time. Angela Spina, you've been granted house arrest. Everything ? Everything. Thank you. Good evening. The Court has granted you a prison visit with your husband, Rosario Parlagreco. Sign here. And here. A patrol car will pick you up and escort you to the prison. Thank you. You're beautiful. What are you doing ? I can't stand seeing you like this. I had to end up here to see you cry ? I wanna smash everything in here. Dry your face. Good. How are you ? I'm fine. I'm fine. I even cooked this morning. How's Minica ? She's getting more and more bitter. Why didn't she come ? I told her not to. I wanted to be alone with you. That's good. Come closer. Don't worry. It'll all be over soon... all. You have to be strong. It's not that. Then what ? Nothing... Mom. Who is it ? Come in. I'm attorney Pelagani, I'm defending Signor Santalucia. I have something important to tell you, in private. Mr Santalucia asked me to give you this This is all I can say: be very cautious. What are we doing ? I want you. What do you want from me ? What is this stupid honor that's keeping you quiet ? What are you going to do ? Who are you trying to save ? They wouldn't do the same for you. I don't know anything about this so-called honor. Explain it to me once and for all. There's just one thing I want to know. Where did I go wrong ? Is there something I didn't do for you ? Was the money not enough ? I'm in here because I wanted you to live like a lady ! Maybe I was no good in bed. Why are you saying this ? Is he better than me ? Look what the judge gave me. Read it. Look at me. I'm getting out of here and I no longer have a home, a family, or a wife. Please. Your Prince Charming, as of today, is a walking corpse. This is your last visit. Don't ever come here again. Give my things to my sister, she'll deal with it. I won't leave you here alone. You've already left me. You've already left me ! But remember this: I truly loved you. Think about it. Because things change. You're young now, but things will change. Now, get out of here. Get out of my life. We now call case 2173/84 against... ...Parlagreco Rosario, Parlagreco Domenico, Gentile Vincenzo, Santalucia Tommaso, Custrieri Luigi, Spina Angela, Costanzo Giuseppe, Milito Iolanda. All present, and under house arrest, except for Parlagreco Rosario, who's held in the Ucciardone prison, and against Ligreci Salvatore, not present today, thus, declared contumacious. The defendant Spina Angela may remain seated next to her attorney. The purpose of today's hearing is to examine a few of the testimonies and the defendants, as requested by them. Your Honor, please, my client's psychophysical conditions have noticeably worsened due to her detention. I kindly ask you to interrogate her first. Very well, Signora Spina. You, as defendant, have the right not to respond. Will you tell the Court what you were given by your husband, the present Saro Parlagreco, to bring to Signor Gentile ? Excuse me, Your Honor. Yes, attorney. Before proceeding... ...a person of unsound mind like her, this woman can not be held accountable for her actions, being completely incapable of intent or will. ...I object, it's evident that this is a simulation, given, the defendant always demonstrated... ...conscious participation in this trial. The Court of Palermo, based on article 530 and the following of the Penal Code, declares the defendants Parlagreco Domenico, Spina Angela, Santalucia Tommaso, Custrieri Luigi, Costanzo Giuseppe, Milito Iolanda, Gentile Vincenzo, Ligreci Salvatore, not guilty of the ascribed crimes. Based on article 533 and the following of the Procedure Code declares Parlagreco Rosario guilty of the ascribed crimes, condemns him to eleven years of imprisonment and prohibits him from holding public office. All defendants, except Parlagreco Rosario, are to be released unless held for other crimes. He said that... I don't care. I'm afraid I won't see you anymore. That scares me. ( phone ringing ) I'm looking for Masino Santalucia. I don't think I can help you. I'm a good friend of your husband. At your service, Signora. ( phone ringing ) Who was it ? Don't worry. Don't worry. Remember when you kissed me at the port ? You should've taken me away then. Now it's too late. It's not too late. Let's pretend nothing happened, that we met today and we'll leave tomorrow. Let's pretend. Signora, I was staring at you from behind and I've fallen madly in love. I understand. If you turn around and have beautiful eyes too, I'll ask for your hand. I'm busy, I'm waiting for my boyfriend. But a beautiful lady like you, I'd never leave waiting alone on the sidewalk in this neighborhood. My boyfriend makes me wait too long. I think so too. Maybe I'll go with you. Do you regret not waiting for your boyfriend ? Of course, you've fallen in love already. Know what you should do ? Tomorrow at 12:00, go to the cafe by the port and wait for me, I'll take you away. One important thing: if I'm not there tomorrow at 12:00, come back the next day. If I'm still not there, come back the day after. And again, until you see me, I'll show up eventually. Got it ? What are you saying ? I'll show up eventually. Wait for me. Masino Santalucia has yet to return. Saro Parlagreco was released from prison in 1995. He now owns a restaurant in Palermo. He never saw his wife again. Angela Parlagreco now works as a dressmaker. She is often found at the cafe by the port.
