(baby cries softly) (lighthearted instrumental) (80's dramatic pop music) - Master. - Huh? (80's dramatic pop music reaches crescendo) - Hey, fellow, what you think you're doing? Don't you see I'm a blind man? (battle cries) (screams in frustration) - [Master] My stick, it's dangerous! Here we go. (pained grunt) Now, careful. (pained scream) Hey, you again, follow me. (screams in pain) (dramatic music) (sword cutting swiftly through air) (surprised clamoring) (screams in pain) (sword cutting swiftly through air) (screaming in pain) (ominous dramatic tone) - Brother, I must hide. Brother, you survived 18 years ago. And I'm looking for you everywhere, brother, brother, brother, brother! (monstrous frustrated screams) Brother! (guttural scream) (flute plays) (pained scream) - And you are? (dramatic music) - I am Fujiko. - Tiger, I've got to tell you all about it. Just about 40 years ago, near the coast of China, there were many pirates, Japanese. Many Chinese people were killed by them. Some of the Japanese, Wi Ho-Ling ninja, all those ninja, there was a bloody massacre. The whole village, only three children survived. I am one of the survivors, the other is the blind man, and the last survivor is your father, Y Chi Ni. (labored coughs) The one that kept us alive is also the one that massacred our family, he is the Grand Master. (sentimental orchestral music) During those bloody days, we were just innocent children. He was a cruel man, ambitious too. The only reason that we stayed there was because we did not understand the truth. (ominous orchestral music) (string music) (dramatic high note) We grew up in the land that really did not belong to us. (swift karate movements cutting through air) And we didn't know we had Chinese blood. (heavy hits landing loudly) (dramatic music) (dramatic trumpet music) The Grand Master was the god-son of Y Ho-Ling. The reason he trained us was to get power for himself. We did not disappoint him, we were just a tool for his power. (dramatic music) He finally gained that power but he wasn't satisfied, he even tried to kill the landlord and take his place, and power. And he trained us harder, and harder. Liu Ti Shen, Y Chi Ni, Chu Son, all became good ninjas, he marked us with the plumb sign. The three of us were working very hard for him. And we did him a great favor. (labored coughs) Since then, we became his powerful tool. People who knew us because all of us had the mark of the plumb sign, they called the three of us the Plumb Ninja, that's it. - Oh, that's why she always wants to see me. She wants to get a look at my body. - That's right. (labored coughing) I have to tell you something else, it's about your parents. - Who is my mother? - She comes from a great family of Japan. (labored and pained grunting) She's named Mariko. (labored coughing) It was another bloody massacre. The Grand Master accepted this cool assignment. (labored coughing) He assigned my brother, Y Chi Ni. (ominous dramatic string music) (ominous dramatic strings rise) Had he forgot the biggest rule of the ninja? (exhales) Mankind, what a mess. Since you were born, we've never had any peace. - Tell me why. (labored coughing) - Because-- - Master! - Master! - Master, master! - Master! - You better rest, please. - No, I have to continue. (coughs) This is a very strange situation. Three of us had a chance to find our past history but too bad, hey, guess he would raise us for more. More. (labored coughs) 10 years it was, at that time, we did not kill the Grand Master, he found out. He found out the secret of your parents. He asked me and my brothers to kill your parents. We did not obey his order, decided to leave him. We left Japan but who knows, who knows, that thing didn't go right, he found us in China! (metal clanging swiftly) (pained scream) - [Y Chi Ni] Run!

Just leave Moriko and the child, I'll spare your life. You want me to leave them alone? You'll have to kill me first! (ominous music) - Want to kill my brother, kill me first! (battle cry) (heavy hits landing) (swiftly cutting through air) (heavy hits landing) (pained groans) (heavy hits landing) (pained groans) (ominous music) (pained groans) - Get away! (ominous music) - Brother! - Ty, take care of the child first, hurry up, go! - What about you? (battle cry) (heavy hits landing) - Just run! (metal clanging) (pained screams) - Princess? (pained scream) Princess! - Go! (ominous music) - Brother, I-- (metal clanging) (heavy hits landing) - Go on! (metal clanging) - Princess! (pained screams) - Run! (ominous music) - Mariko, get going! (ominous music) Mariko, Mariko! (pained scream) (metal clanging swiftly) (pained scream) - Brother! - Run away! Run, now! (ominous music) - Run. (ominous music) (dramatic flute instrumental) (labored coughing) - I was holding you when I escaped and brought you, brought you here. I also pretended to be a beggar to cover up us. - Oh, master! - Master! - Master! - It's too bad. For 18 years of escaping, we have to come to this end. (pained groans) - My master, I must tell you, the Grand Master is well-prepared in order to find you. - Master, I'm gonna kill him! - No, Tiger. - Master, master! (pained groans) - It's too bad none of us can get away from here. (pained groans) - Master, I'll get you out. I'll get you out of here. - Tiger, don't forget, if you see the ninja with a mask, don't confront him. - Why not, master, I'm not afraid of him, I can kill him easily. - Because he is your father, Chin Y Ni. (shocked gasp) - Master? - Brother! (pained groans) - Master, we have to get him out of here. Otherwise, it'll be too late. - Me, there's no way, none of you can get out of here. (pained groans) - Master, master! (startled screams) (hard blows landing) (deadly blow reverberates) (dramatic string music) (dramatic string music) (ominous music) - Master, please forgive me. I never did practice Kung Fu hard enough. From now on, it doesn't matter how hard it's gonna be. But I'm gonna strive hard for it. I'm gonna kill all those ninjas to get even, just for you! Master, (sniffles) master! (somber string music) - Brother? - What is it? - What are you going to do? - Those ninja are looking for him everywhere. I think you better stay with him for awhile and help him to practice, I'll check out the news. You understand? - Yes, I do. - Maybe we should treat him like the old Tiger. This will make him feel better. (somber music) (sniffles) (thunderous gushing of water) (dramatic strings) - Hey, master. - Hey, keep the voice down. - Oh? - How's the business going then? - Very good, we got a full house tonight. - Oh, that's very good! (pained screams) Get up! (pained screams) - Aw, no, not again, master! (pained groan) Master, this is too sour, I'm gonna be sick, master! - Shut up, just keep your concentration on your mind. Let the blood flow over your body, let the air get into your stomach, all these are good feelings. (heavy hits landing) (pained groans) Keep still, don't move! (battle grunts) (heavy hit landing) - Teacher! - These few days, I know you've had a bad time. I know I never gave you such a hard time before. But if I do not train your head, by the time you'll get to real practice, I'm afraid that your body won't be able to handle it, I know I forsooth it. - Master, I understand, but, but-- - But, but, but what? - Why don't you let me get some fire to warm me up? - Warm fire? - Yeah. - Warm fire will force the cold air into your body, this'll kill you straight away. You're not really cold, your body just thinks you are. - Ninja, what is ninja, big deal. (heavy hit lands) (pained groan) Master! - Don't call me master! - Master, try some soup, it's not bad. - What's going on here, where'd you get the money for this meal? - Well, the business is good, more tips. And the customers, well, they're treating me very well. (chuckling) Cheers. (choking and coughing) Master! (coughing) - It's nothing. Go get me the blue bottle which is under the bed. - Master, this is easy, I can do it easy. - Hold it. - Master, what is this? Master, this is oil! - Go! (pained grunt) (heavy hit landing) (pained grunt) (heavy hits landing) (pained grunt) (heavy hits landing) - Teacher, let me go, let me go, please! (pained groan) Teacher, let me go! (deadly hits landing) (pained groan) (fatal hit reverberates) (somber string music) (dramatic orchestral music) (swords cut through air) (dramatic music) (swords cut through air) (dramatic music) (heavy hit landing) (heavy hits landing) (pained groans) (thunderous water rages) (heavy hits cutting through air) (heavy hits cutting through air) Stationary work from heart. (swiftly cutting movements) Advancing with the knee up. (swiftly cutting movements) Same leg bending and rising. (swiftly cutting movements) Single leg squat posture. (swiftly cutting movements) Spread arms like a fan on a bird. Sweep the lotus with one leg, ferry waving at the shuttle. (swiftly cutting movements) (battle cry) Deep breathing, handle your reserve. (thunderous water rages) - Tiger, do you want to get some rest? - What are you doing? - It's nice to take a bath after practice. - Now, don't treat me too well, you got that? - We Japanese girls are born for man and take care of man, it's our business and duty. And besides, the last time-- - Stop it. What happened last night, it was a mistake. I was drunk, I didn't know what I was doing. Furthermore, I don't know if you have any purpose at all. So, it's, well, you see-- (stammers) - So, you didn't like me? - No, no, no, no. I didn't mean that, it's just I want to practice my Kung Fu. It's very important to me, since master passed away, it's been very difficult, I gotta get revenge for him. That's the one thing I've gotta do. - Don't worry, Tiger, I know you'll make it. (thunderous water rages) (uptempo music) - Hey, what are you doing? - In Japan, we bathe together. - But I'm Chinese, I'm not used to it, I'll do it my way. - You'll get used to it by practicing. (uptempo music) - Hey, now, don't come near me, stay away, stay away. - Don't be shy. (laughing) (uptempo music) Hey, c'mon, let me help you, c'mon. - Yeah, I don't want it, I don't want it. - Don't be shy! - I don't like it, really. (woman giggles) (uncomfortable groans) Ugh, I'll do it myself! (giggling) (uncomfortable groans) (uptempo music) (woman giggles) I can do it. (uncomfortable groans) (woman giggles) No, ugh. (uncomfortable groans) (uptempo music) (uncomfortable groans) Ugh, I can do it. (woman giggles) Hey. (uptempo music) (playful music) Zakura! (playful music) Zakura! Zakura, Zakura! (playful music) (pained groan) (playful music) - Tiger, Tiger? Tiger, Tiger, Tiger, Ti-- (mocking laugh) (small gasp) - Rascal. - It's so nice to have some fun and games. And it's nice to relax. - This is all because of the Kung Fu which was taught by your master, that's why you. - Zakura, you're lecturing me now? - No, I'm not, I'm just trying to remind you to practice hard otherwise you won't be able to beat the Grand Master. - Forget it, you girls are always repeating yourself. - Forgive me. - Eh, Zakura, I think this is all your fault. If you're not asking me to take bath with you, or telling me how to get used to all those Japanese, damn Japanese customs, which I hate anyway. Maybe I can concentrate more on my practice, who's fault is it then? So, what do you say, you're fault? Zakura. - Yes, master. - Stop calling me, master! - But you are the young master. - I just done being nice to you and then you start calling me master, look, I don't like it. It hurts my feelings and also my mood. - But you-- - Zakura, let's get away from here. - Why? - This life is no fun, I want to live like we did before. What do you say? Zakura? What's a matter, you got some dust in your eyes? I'll clean it for you. - Master! I didn't know you were so irresponsible. - Oh, you cry because of this? Zakura, listen to me, I mean what I say. - But why? - Try to think of it this way. We have a close relationship, and I like you a lot. But if I was killed by the Grand Master, or what happened to you, well-- - Please, stop saying that. (somber music) - Zakura, by the time we take care of everything, I'll marry you, alright? (somber music) - Master, your care is deeply touching me. But once you get back to the royal identity, I'm afraid-- - You're the first woman in my life, I'm very serious, and I promise you. - Let's stop talking, let God handle everything for us. Get some rest, master. (somber music) (attack grunts) Tiger, take a rest now, the dinner's ready, see? (attack grunts) You should practice in the right way, don't overdo it. - Don't disturb me! - Okay, but eat now. - Let him practice, you come with me. - No, I have to stay here and take care of him. - I'm afraid you're disturbing him. - Where are you going, brother? - To get Tiger a teacher. (somber music) (heavy hits landing) (somber music) (gently streaming water) - Zaukra, I want to know why you and your brother would help me. - Because you're different from other people. - What's that, different? You mean a wild boy that grows up in a whore house? You try to tease me, then do it to my face! - I'm not trying to tease you, you and I are different. - So tell me, what am I, why do you treat me so well? - It's not the right time to stay. - What do you mean, what do you mean it's not the right time? At least tell me something! Couldn't you let me in on the secret? I want to know the truth behind everything, I want to know it, you better tell me! - Yes, yes. - Tell me when! - Don't force me. - I want to know, who are you people, why are you here? - We are servants. - Servant? (laughs poisonously) What is a servant? Why are you here to serve me? I don't deserve a servant. (laughs contemptuously) (ominous music) - Who's there? - It's me, master. - Oh, so you want to have fun with me, is that it? - I do not. - Humph, what's the matter? - I have hope that you can teach Tiger the original Ninja Kung Fu. - Huh? It's not so easy to learn that Kung Fu. I am just a blind man. - But in the old days, three of you Plumb Ninja knew it very well. (giggles) - Somebody still remembers a Plumb Ninja, well, if you know about the Plumb Ninja then you should that Tiger's master is at Ty, and not I. - Master, didn't you know that, that Ty is gone? (ominous music) - Huh? Say that again. (ominous music) - Master Ty has killed himself because he tried to save Y. - Hmm, who are you, why should I believe you? Now, tell me the truth. (ominous music) - Because I'm the one who's asking him to. - Huh? (ominous music) - Your highness, I am Fujiko, and I am at your service. Please accept me. - Princess? It that Mariko? - That's right, it's I, Mariko Kinda. - Aw, sister in law, what's been happened to you? - I seek for revenge so I moved in Yakone City 18 years ago. - Yakone City, huh, Yakone City. Mariko, why didn't you see your son? - I swear if I did not kill the murderer, I would never see my son. (ominous music) Oh, that's some oath, that's pretty sad too. - Now, do you know what happened to Ty? - Alright, you don't have to say it. I'll be the teacher for Tiger, I'll teach him that Kung Fu, don't worry, but Mariko, there's still something I don't understand, 18 years ago I thought you were dead. What's happened to you, how come you can make it here today in front of me? - God blessed me, and I was able to survive, and to live until now. - Oh, so you survived, right, Mr. Fujiko, bring me to Tiger right now. (ominous music) - Zakura, Zakura, Zakura! Please tell me why you're trying to hide something from me. - Don't force me, I can't tell you. You've gotta tell me. - You, please don't-- - Let me tell you. - Fortune teller? - Don't call me that, I am actually your uncle. But from now on, I'll be your master in Kung Fu. - Master? - That's right. And from now on, he'll teach you Ninja Kung Fu. Zakura and I will leave for awhile. - What for, you guys can practice together. - This style, as not everybody can learn it. Only the royal family can practice it. - Royal family? How come Master Ty knows battle moves? - Because Ty is a member of the royal family in Japan, so, of course he knows it. - Why should I learn this royal Kung Fu? - Because you're from the royal family. A great shogun is your uncle. - Uncle? (dramatic string hits) - A royal Kung Fu was originally from the Teng Dynasty of the Chinese Empire. This style is combined with Chinese national gymnastics, and with Persian self-defense techniques. (dramatic music) - This style was welcomed by the royal famly of Japan and became it's family Kung Fu. The basic way of training the style is to practice under different weather circumstances. Finally, the human force will combine with the natural force. (dramatic music) (dramatic music rises) (water flows) (swift hand movements) (dramatic music) (dramatic music intensifies) (dramatic music breaks into flurry) - The first step of our revenge is prepare. - Do you think the Grand Master will easily fall into the trap? - It's worth a try. - Good. This will cut down his power at this moment. I hope he'll make it this time, at least. - I think we have a chance. - I have a request, your highness. - Hm, what is your request? - I wish to continue serving the young master. - You dare? This is against the family rules. - It's alright, I agree, if not because all these rules, I may be better off without these troubles, you go ahead. - Thank you, your highness. (swiftly cutting Karate moves) (dramatic music) (grunting with effort) - Master, I made a chicken for you. - Aw, thanks, (hums in approval) it's good. (victorious music) - Want some water, master? - Hey, wait. I want to ask you. - What do you want to know? - The master told me a lot but I still have some questions. If the master didn't want to tell you, then forget it. But I've got a right to know where my mother is. Zakura, you've been with my mother for a long time. At least you can tell me what she looks like. - I don't know, she's always wearing a mask. But no one's seen her face before. - Zakura, I beg you, please take me to my mother. Please, I beg you. - No, I can't. I cannot. - Nothing's impossible. I just want to have a look, I won't say anything. - I can't, I can't. - Zakura. - Sorry. - Zakura. - No way. - Zakura, I never saw my parents, when I was sick, no one cared for me, when I was cold, no one gave me clothes. - I understand, I don't have parents either. - Then you should help me, show me the way, Zakura. Let me see, Zakura, I beg you, do this for me. Just one more time, I will not give you any trouble. I'll be thankful to you for the rest of my life. Zakura, I beg you, help me do this, Zakura. Thank you, thank you very much. (epic villainous music) - Oh no, they see us. (epic villainous music) Hide yourself, I'll distract them. (epic villainous music) (music intensifies with deep drumming) (ominous music) (rising ominous music) - C'mon. (birds tweeting) (epic ominous music) - I'll save you! (grunting) - Well, Fujiko, what can you say now? I'm still looking for White Tiger, although not being successful, why should I die because of that? And no mercy at all! (amused evil laughing) - This Chinese kid must be White Tiger! - Him? - Huh? What? White Tiger? I'm Tiger Y! - That's right, he hasn't got the plumb sign, it can't be him! - Then tell me why he showed up here! - He's just a hunter, I asked him to help me! - Hey, you, I only came here to lead the way for $5. I didn't know that I had to go through all this trouble. I have to increase my fee now. (amused evil laughing) - Very well. Fujiko, kill him. (dramatic music) - What? - He is not White Tiger so, big deal. - Master, ninjas don't do this kind of thing. - If I ask you to do it-- - I can't. - Look, I just came here for the ride! (dramatic music) - Do it! (dramatic music) - Sorry, friend, let's get to it. (swiftly slicing movements) (dramatic music) (heavy hits landing) C'mon, go! (heavy hits landing) (grunting with effort) (pained groan) - Get him! - Yes! (dramatic music) Master, master, master! Master, master, master! - I'm here. - Master, good acting. - Heh. I know what to do when the crisis comes. But I don't understand, why are you so afraid of him? - Because he is the Grand Master. - What? (dramatic music) Why didn't you tell me? (dramatic music) I'm gonna kill him! - No! Not now, you're not his match. - Let me go, otherwise-- - Master! (grunting with effort) Master! (dramatic music) Master, you can't go, you can do anything but promise me, don't go into him. - Fujiko, remember I'm your master. - Yes. (dramatic music) Master! (grunting with effort) (dramatic music rises) - So, you are the Grand Master? - Fujiko didn't catch you? - I'll kill you for my teacher. (battle cry) (heavy blows reverberating) (heavy blows landing) (groaning in pain) (heavy blows landing) (groaning in pain) (dramatic music) (fire burns loudly) - Let me go, please, let me go, I'm innocent. - You betrayed the Grand Master, everybody knows it. And you claim yourself innocent? (laughs fiendishly) - Bullshit! - Save your breath! She always goes on top of us, well, now, (scoffs) it's our chance to get even! (snickers) You can't get away now! - Tonight, we can have a good time? - Yeah! (uproarious laughter) (fiendish snide snickering) - Oh. - Ah. - Hey. - Her skin is so smooth. - Yeah, really great body too, look at that, oh, my god. (fiendish snide snickering) (woman whimpers) (fiendish snide snickering) - Hey, go to it, outfit. (screams in pain) Hey, whoa! (dramatic music) (metal clangs) (screams in pain) (dramatic strings) (sword whizzes through air) (pained scream) (dramatic music) (water rushing gently) - Why, Grand Master, his Kung Fu is really something. If I don't practice the royal style well, then don't even think about revenge. I'm afraid my little life will be taken away by him some day. (epic villainous music rises) Why do you cover your heads with black cloth? I've got nothing to do with you! Why do you guys keep on going after me? I don't see why you have to kill me. Hey, you guys got the wrong man. Hey, can you guys hold back, I am a good fellow. I don't want to die. (heavy blows landing) (ominous music) (heavy blows landing) (heavy blows landing) (pained groans) (dramatic ominous music) (thunderous raging water) - I think he's dead anyway, let's go back and tell the Grand Master, c'mon! (villainous brass music) (trumpets rise to crescendo) - He fell into the river? But are you sure that he's dead? - That river is deep and wide, if he fell into it, we're pretty sure he's dead. - Is the river soft or is it hard? Is it soft? - It's soft. He fell from a high place into the river. Is he already dead then, tell me, c'mon, tell me! - But he got hit by our dart before he went down into the river! (laughs fiendishly with delight) - Very good. - Thank you, master. - Heh, what fools you are, let me tell you guys something. Although, I really believed what Fujiko said, then because I think he knows too much, the best way to keep him silent is to kill him. Do it anyway you like but just kill him. - Yes, master. - I want to see his body. Then I'll believe he's dead, understand? - Yes, master! - Go! (dramatic ominous music) - How come they're not back yet? - Don't worry, princess, have faith in them. Good news must be coming. - Tiger is very important to me. If he got any trouble, 18 years of plan will be wasted completely, beside that, I would've lost my beloved son forever. - Princess. My master. - Princess. - Did you find my son? - Not yet. - Please, princess, we will. We'll find the young master. - Huh? Does Zakura know about it yet? - Yes. (rising somber dramatic music) - Ugh, once, when a woman give herself to a man, she will not be alone anymore, her feeling of good and bad will change according to the man. I know she must be feeling bad right now. My heart goes out to her. (lighthearted music) (fast stream flowing loudly) (lighthearted music rises) (screams in shock) - Grandpa! Grandpa, grandpa! (dramatic music) Grandpa! (grandpa grunting) - Here, you son of a bitch! You try to rob a guy in broad daylight? I wonder what kind of balls you've got, you scamp, you! - Grandpa, he's not doing anything! - He's just, just-- - What do you mean? He's on top of you! - He's wounded. That's why he's on top of me. - Huh? Oh, yeah, huh, let me see the wound. (mumbling in sleep) - Zakura. - Hat Su, he was hurt pretty bad. It seems that he was hit by a dart, I think. - Grandpa, I think this guy has lots of luck. If not for you, then maybe he'd be already dead already, you know? (amused chuckle) - So he was, he was really lucky. Well, you go and look after him. I am going to get some more medicine for him to make him better, that's what I'm gonna do. - Yes, grandpa. - If he awakes, give him some chicken soup, ask him his name, and don't you let him go. - I know. You afraid his wound might get bigger? - Well, that is only one reason. Somebody must be trying to kill him. Now, you can tell by his wounds, he's got some enemies around the place, it might be dangerous to keep him. - I understand, so you're afraid his enemies might find him, is that right? - Yes. (amused snicker) - Grandpa, but why do you want to know his name? - Heh, that's because-- - I know, if someone looks for him and asks his name, I can say yes or no. - No. Grandpa is afraid that if he dies, we can have a name put on his gravestone so nobody will call him a spirit without a home anywhere in the world. - Grandpa, you're such a good doctor. I think he's going to make it. - Okay, okay, stop being a glib-talker. You take care of him, okay? I am going now, alright? (lighthearted music) (talks in sleep) - Zakura, is she Japanese? (lighthearted music) (woman hyperventilates lightly) (woman whimpers) At least you should tell me who you are, what's your name, how can I tell my grandpa when he comes back? - Hat Su, Hat Su, what you want to tell me? - Nothing, I'll go and wash the clothes. - Hat Su. - Grandpa! (woman cries) (dramatic music) - You took advantage of my granddaughter. You're telling me that you don't know what happened? - Hey, master, I really can't remember. If I'm lying, God will punish me. - You, well, you, ah, alright. I believe you for now, but still you have to respond for what you did to her, I'm too old. I only have one request, I don't care if you say yes or no, you have to do it anyway or I won't heal you. - Grandpa, heal me. - Tiger, you must, after your recovery, I want you to marry Su. (dramatic music) - But-- (amused snickering) - I tell you, after your recovery, I want you to marry my granddaughter. You must! - Grandpa, I'm not saying no. But I don't know Su well, how can I marry her? - Did you know her well when you did it? How you gonna explain that? - But I didn't know. - What? (dramatic music) - Let me think about it. - Tiger. - Alright. (amused snickering) - You're a scamp. You can't get away from me. (amused snickering) (lighthearted ominous music) (music rises dramatically) (dramatic music) (swift movements cutting through air) (heavy blows landing) (pained groans) (heavy blows landing) (pained groans) (dramatic music) (swiftly flies through air) (heavy blows landing) (pained groans) (heavy blows landing) (pained groans) (dramatic music) (dramatic music rises) - You fool, meathead, ah, I was wrong about you two. - Master, what have I don't to deserve this humiliation? - Yo Ling is facing the moment of truth. I don't treat you people at all badly. And up to today, please forget everything. - Zakura is a ninja of Ye Ho-Ling, I will do my very best. (snide amused chuckling) - Just be faithful to me, I won't let you down. I've raised you since you were small. (snide amused chuckling) What a pretty girl you are, huh? (fiendish laughter) - I will never forget your grace's help. - After everything's been taken care of, you will all get your rewards. If we make it, wealth and power will be below our feet, spread out for miles. - Zakura wishes the Grand Master school to become successful. Wealth and power will come with the Great Master. - Very well, you can go now, get me Tiger, and his mother. Also, the Plumb Ninja too, only will hurt us back. Do this as fast as possible, do it for me now. Go on. - Yes, I know. - Master, you let him go just like that? - Follow them! - Yeah! - Hat Su, if you marry Tiger, I shall be so relieved. This is predestination, I know it. Why should he just be lying in the river like that? - Grandpa, this is not so good. By forcing him, what if he's been found already? And if he doesn't go home, his wife will suffer a lot. How is she going to live then? Just tell me that, grandpa. - Your heart's too kind, my girl, he took your virginity, you still care for him. And he's family, what if he sold you, huh? What if he sold you? - Grandpa just think about it. - Ugh, hmm, it's getting late, we'd better go home, c'mon. (gasps) (dramatic music) - Tiger! (dramatic music) Grandpa, Tiger's gone! - Huh, Hat Su. (dramatic music) Hat Su! - Tiger! (dramatic music) Tiger, Tiger! (dramatic music) Tiger! - Hat Su! - Tiger! (dramatic music) - Hat Su, wait, Hat Su! Hat Su! - Tiger! - He's left a note, he's left a note for you. (dramatic music rises) - [Tiger Reading Note] Su and grandpa, I am gone, nevermind, maybe for a short time, maybe forever. (somber string music) You may think I'm cruel but I have a reason. Sometimes, you can't control your own destination. I have something very important to do. If I fail, many people will be disappointed. One day, if I am still alive, I will come back for you. If I get killed, then I won't see you forever. I owe you and your grandpa my life, and I will never forget it, signed, Tiger. (woman cries) - I know you cannot force him to stay, you didn't listen to me. (woman cries) - He can still wait. He should be near, let's go get him! - Forget it! - Hey, c'mon, c'mon. What do you want? - Who you looking for? Is he wounded? - It's not your business. - You guys are-- - Where did he go? - We don't know. - Even if we knew, we wouldn't tell you. (grunts with effort) (anguished screams of pain) (swift attacks cutting through air) (hard blows landing) (swiftly cutting through air) (hard blows landing) (swiftly cutting through air) (dramatic ominous music) - Master. - Yes, I'll help you take care of these two ninjas. (swiftly cutting through air) (hard blows landing) (swiftly cutting through air) (hard blows landing) (pained groans) (hard blows landing) - Master. - Tiger, let's go home. - Oh. - Fujiko. - My master, thank you for saving Tiger. (amused giggling) - It's nothing. Anything assigned by the princess must be done. - After this, I think he'll practice harder. (amused giggling) - I hope so. (jeering and guffawing) - C'mon, poke him a little. - Yeah, c'mon, hey, just on the chin there, c'mon, big boy. Look at, nasty, crazy. (jeering and guffawing) (jeering and guffawing) Look at him, hey, big boy. Hey, c'mon, wake up, watch out for him, I'm gonna break your little heart, huh? (jeering and guffawing) Oh c'mon, he can handle it, try again, yeah, c'mon! Here, a bit harder, woops, hey, c'mon. (jeering and guffawing) Catch me if you can, c'mon. You can't touch me, hey look at that, c'mon. (jeering and guffawing) Rough huh, gonna play rough, oh, look at this. (jeering and guffawing) Hey, it's funny man. Look at that, hey, you get me, I'll get your fingers. (jeering and guffawing) Snip, more pieces. Oh, this is fun, yeah, that's right. (jeering and guffawing) You can't get me. (jeering and guffawing) Try again. Go on, c'mon, get your hand off-- (jeering and guffawing) (pained groaning) (grunts with effort) (pained groan) (grunting with effort) (pained scream) (monstrous grunting) (dramatic music) - Fukjiko, thank you. - This belongs to Ty Master, please. - Did you get it from him? - Yes. - Demo, bring it to Y. We will start the second stage of our revenge plan now. We'll avenge Y. (dramatic string music) (dramatic music) (discordant anxious strings) (explosion) (dramatic music) (fiendish laughter) - Ty Ninja, I can tell it's you even though you're wearing your mask. Last time you got away, this time it's not so easy. Show me your stuff, c'mon, impress me! (dramatic music) (weapons clanging against each other) (swiftly cutting through air) (high pitched projectile whirs) (swiftly cutting through air) (weapons clanging against each other) (heavy blows landing) (weapons clanging against each other) (weapons clanging against each other) (heavy blows landing) (uptempo string instrumental) - C'mon, hurry up. - Master, master, I can't, you're too heavy. - A little run won't kill you, heh, this is all because you are lazy and reckless, hey? (laughs) - Master, I'm dying. - Nope, hurry up. There, go be smart, hurry up. (groans in pain) - Master? (uptempo string instrumental) - Okay, c'mon, be smart, let's go, alright. - Oh. - C'mon. - Master, I can't. (uptempo string music) - Back now, bring him back before noon. - Master, it's almost daytime. Ninjas never act during the day. - Huh, this is no time for rules. If he doesn't come back to take the medicine within six hours, he will become normal, and none of us will be able to beat him. Right now he might create many troubles for us. So I want you to go and find him, and get him here. Go on, get him! - But Grand Master. - I don't care what the cost will be, I want him back, go now, I want him back as soon as possible. - Yes sir! (uptempo string music) - Hey, hurry up, c'mon, faster! Hurry up, did you hear me, hurry up, that's very good. Don't get lazy now, c'mon, hurry up. - Master, you're heavy, I want to take a break. - Hey, I've got a spiritual song, hey, kid, sick, stop complaining, let's get going. (uptempo string music) - Master, look, there's someone there. - Hm, maybe just a hunter. - I don't think so. - It looks like, yes, it's a ninja. - Oh, alright, let's go and see if we can pull him out. - Okay. (uptempo string music) - Tiger! (uptempo string music) Tiger! Tiger! Tiger! (weapons clanging against each other) (heavy blow landing) (groaning in pain) - Hey, how's it going, you see anybody? - Strange, how did it disappear? - Ah, where are we right now, huh? - Uh, I think we're gonna reach the 10-milestone soon. Oh, shit! - Huh, what's wrong? (dramatic music) - Look at all the dead bodies around here! (dramatic music) - I'm blind, I can't see them. (dramatic music) Well, how did they die? (dramatic music) - They've been mutilated. - Aw, let's go. - For what? - Otherwise, it'd be too late. (dramatic music) C'mon, hurry up. (dramatic music) Alright, let me down. (dramatic music) - Wow, we were lucky that we made a fast getaway. Otherwise, who knows what would happen? (dramatic music) - Hm, why are you so chicken? How are you gonna beat the ninja that way? - Huh, of course we can beat a ninja. What if there's a beast, or a mad dog, or a thief? Just try to stay out of trouble, am I right, huh? (chuckles) - Uh, if you want to be a successful master, you have to brave. Try to be still, no, huh, hey, do you hear anything? Well, did ya? - Besides the waterfall, I didn't hear anything. - Shut your eyes now. - Oh. - I heard, I think it was a baby crying. - Hm, you're right. - Not bad guess, huh? - Huh, and there's a bird singing too. (epic ominous dramatic music) (loud heavy blows being thrown) (dramatic music) - It's Fujiko, I better go help. (dramatic music) (loud heavy blows landing) (loud heavy blows being thrown) - Master? - Go now! - I can't. (loud heavy blows) (groaning in pain) (dramatic music) - Brother! (dramatic music) (monstrous grunt) - Go now, go on, quick, run! (dramatic music) (monstrous grunt) C'mon! (grunting with effort) (loud heavy blow) - Fujiko! (battle cry) (groans in pain) - Go, Ni, now, quick, go! - Fujiko! (groaning in pain) (monstrous grunting) (dramatic music) (loud heavy blows being thrown) (loud heavy blows) - Masked ninja, but why, masked ninja? (dramatic music) (loud heavy blows) Masked ninja but why, masked ninja, but why? (monstrous grunting) (pained groans) Masked ninja, but why, masked ninja, masked ninja. (loud heavy blows) (groans in pain) (loud heavy blows) (groans in pain) (dramatic music) (monstrous grunting) (groans in pain) (loud heavy blows) (groans in pain) (sword cutting swiftly through air) (loud heavy blows) (groans in pain) (monstrous grunting) (groans in pain) (sword cutting swiftly through air) (monstrous grunting) (groans in pain) (flute plays) (loud heavy blows) (monstrous grunting) (groans in pain) (flute plays) (loud heavy blows) (dramatic music) (monstrous groaning) (explosion) (high pitched flying through air) (triumphant orchestral music)
