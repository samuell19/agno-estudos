You? Are you a Muslim? You. Are you a Muslim? Don't! Let me. This is mine! Boss, shut him up! Knock him out! Look after the boss. The rest of you, grab some weapons and follow them. Hurry! Hey, look everywhere! Where the hell is that guy? Hey! There they are! Follow them! Hey, stop! Stop! Hello. Hello. What happened to you now? Sister. My friend wants to stay here. You are stupid. You're useless, you let him take advantage of you. Will you wait until it is too late? He is not a bad man. He gets drunk and gets into a fight every day. If he isn't a criminal, what is he? The point is, I don't want to get into trouble here because of your boyfriend. Mada? When will your journey end, Son? Until the wound in my heart is healed. You can't heal your heart if you keep hiding like this. Your sister and I miss you very much. - I don't want to go home. - Come with me. I said I don't want to go home. Please give my regards to my sister. Dear God. - I will take my leave now. - Please. Dad? Dad! Peace be upon you. Dad! Dad. Dad! What's wrong? Does your wound hurt? Aren't you tired of living this way? Why do you always ask me that? I'm serious. I have enough savings now... to pay off the agent who brought me here. I want to buy a ticket to go home to Indonesia. I'm tired of living like this. I'm tired of being Marbel. I'm Maryati. I want to go back to my hometown. I want to see my mother, my siblings. I'm tired of doing all this. Mada? Let's go home to Indonesia. No. I don't want to go home. Why? Is one year not enough to forget her? It's none of your business. - Since when do we keep secrets? - Maryati. We're friends, that's all. My boss was right. I'm just a stupid woman, or you're the one without feelings. Don't talk to me about feelings. I'm like this because I feel too much. I suppose it's my bad luck, then. I fell in love with the wrong person. Hey. Sofia? Mada, your sister has been looking all over for you. I know what I feel. I'm in love with you. What's got into you? - Is this for real? - Yes. I'm in love with you. Why is it so hard to tell you how I feel? Hello? Who's this? Hey, Sis. - Are you well? - I'm well. Why not just do this over the phone? I know you're asking me to come home. Why bother coming all the way here? You know it's impossible for me to come home. - This time you have to come home. - Why? Dad's waiting for you. You're joking. Some more advice? I'm like this because of his advice. - Are you still so angry with him? - Yes. He's never stopped loving you for 27 years. I've been praying for 27 years. Never once missed the fasting ritual. "Pray and your prayer shall be answered." Where is it? But you don't have to blame others. Least of all, God. What do you want? You want me to apologize to him? Fine. I'm sorry, for leaving him, for taking responsibility, for expecting too much of him. Go home and tell him that. - I can't do that. - Why not? It's just not possible now. Why not? He passed away. After you left, he fell ill. He died as a pilgrim in Mecca. He will be buried along with the other pilgrims. Mala, sorry for interrupting. But we're about to start the prayer. - All right. - Have you seen your brother? This is my brother. I'm so sorry for your loss. Mada, let's pray for dad. What are you doing here? Some thugs are looking for you. - They came to my workplace. - They're looking for me? You killed one of them. - I killed no one! - But they said you did. - Lower your voice. - You killed someone? I didn't kill anybody. A friend at the office just told me. An Indonesian killed a gang member here in Patpong. - See? - Did you hear? Why would you ask me that? I know nothing about it. Stop it. You need to find a hiding place. Just shut up. - You can get killed. - Don't tell me what to do. - Stay out of this. - Klahan is a very vicious gang. - They will take a life for a life. - I'm not afraid. - Go back to Indonesia. - I won't go back. You're not safe here. I'm not going back to Indonesia and you stay out of my business. Mada! Mada, where are you going? Please stop here. Mada! - Leave me alone. - He stays here. - Does he stay here? - Yes, he stays here! Hey, find him! Mada, where are you going? I have some stuff to pick up. So noisy. Hey, do you see an Indonesian guest? - I really don't know. - You don't know? Find him! Hey, Mada. Mada, what's your plan now? You know I never have a plan. Mada! How many times do I have to tell you? I won't return to Indonesia. Fine, wherever you want. But you have to get out of Thailand. If you want, you can go to Vietnam. I have a friend there at the embassy. Please stop here. Here you go, 900. Mada... Why are you so quiet? What's on your mind? I'm thinking about tomorrow night's event. Tomorrow. What's tomorrow? How come I didn't know about it? I'm going to see your father to ask for your hand in marriage. Mada, Please tell me you're joking. Do I look like I'm joking? Don't you think our relationship's going too fast? What's the difference? Today or next year, all the same. In the end, I will still propose. Unless you don't love me. Well, that's not fair. You know I love you. That's enough. That's enough for me. All right. Stop it. Just stay quiet. You're making me thirsty now. - Is this pork? - What? - Okay. Just give me that one. - He wants the oyster. No, this bill cannot be used here. Do you have Dong? No. No. It must be Dong. It can't be this one. - Thank you. - Thank you. Sofia? - Sofia... - What Sofia? Go away! Stop making noise. Nobody can sleep. Mada. Today I'm going to pay off my debts... to the employment agent who brought me here. I want to start a new life. I'm tired of this kind of life. I was hoping to start a new life with you. But I realize now... that it's impossible. I can't live my life with you. I will always pray for you. Hope you can find a new life that will make you happy. Hey, what's wrong with you? My God, you've got a bad fever! Hey, there are some fever pills in the jar. Bring them for me. And some water, too! Wait, wait. Yeah. Wake up and take the pills, please. Now, get some sleep. Anything else I can help with? It's okay. Just return to your place. Get some rest now. You'll be fine. Don't worry. Bring the small boxes first. The big ones later. One, two, three. Lift it up! Okay! Papa! The stranger is awake. Don't stand up. You are sick. Drink this so you heal quickly. Drink. Get some rest. Sleep. Don't force yourself to sit up, much less stand on your feet. Where are you going? Don't go too far. You're not completely healed. - Mada. - Mata? - Mada. - Mata? Su Chun! Don't let our guest walk too far. Come home. Yes, Father! They found in one of the cardboard... They found in one of the cardboard... Praise Allah who has brought you to my father How could you let your body be wounded without making an effort to heal it? Did you get in a fight using sharp weapons? Do you remember how you got in a sack and came to be brought here? - How much? - Five bucks. Su Chun, please invite him to pray with us at the mosque. - He doesn't pray. - Are you a Christian? - No. - Catholic? - Buddhist? - Buddhist? - No. - Hindu? - Why? - Why? I apologize. I've probably asked too many questions. I'm sure you have your reasons why you prefer not to pray. I don't want to force you to tell me why. - It's okay. - Guo! Everyone's waiting! I'm coming. But if you'd like to talk, I'm a good listener. - Assalammu'alaikum. - Wa'alaikumsalam. - Sofia. - Yes? I got the answer from God. Well, what did you ask Him? About our relationship. Our marriage will be fine. I'll have to talk to my dad. Why? Have you discovered the truth in Sofia? That she truly loves you? Yes. I'm certain of it. So you're willing to be responsible for the welfare of this family you want to build? I will and I can be responsible for them. - Promise? - Promise. Okay then. I've no problem with it. - Assalammu'alaikum. - Wa'alaikumsalam. Be patient, Sir. Please, be patient. She's getting ready. Where is she? The clock is ticking. People are wondering. Have you tried reaching her? Sofi? - Sofi? - Sofi? - Is she in there? - Yes, she's in there. - Fi? - Sofi? - Sofi? - Sofi? Hold on. This is all I can give you. - Assalammu'alaikum. - Wa'alaikumsalam. - Damn, stupid driver! - Uncle, what's wrong? My driver owes me money. Three times his monthly wage. Now I have to drive myself into town. - Find another driver. - He left this morning. How can I find another driver in such a short time? Uncle, will you accept my friend as your driver? - Can you drive? - Sure. - You're a driver now. - Okay. Low price. Come, come. Promotion! Promotion! Please come, please come. Good stuff. Please come. Good stuff. Please come. - How much is this? - 50. - Is this okay? - Just take it. Yeah. Thank you. - Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. Thank you. Don't know how to do anything, no business sense. What a terrible man. - Assalammu'alaikum. - Wa'alaikumsalam. Tired. I don't understand what you're talking about. Why are you still working? Where are your children? - I feel tired. - Tired. Working all the time. It's the air. Tired. He's asking for a lift. Wa'alaikumsalam. By God's will. - Assalammu'alaikum. - By God's will. - Assalammu'alaikum. - Wa'alaikumsalam. - These are some clothes for you. - Thank you. If You could appear before me, perhaps it would be easier for me to believe in You. If I could only hear Your voice, then I would know what it is You want from me. I realize... I realize, not everything has to go my way. Perhaps this is Your way of testing my faith. How can I serve You? Show me. Tell me. Mada? Mada. I love you very much. I love you, but only that much. How much? As much as two childhood friends can love each other. So don't ask me about love, because I've never found it. Why now? Why didn't you just tell me before? Why did you leave me? Why? Yes, that was my mistake. I was afraid of destroying your faith. I... I was scared. You kept telling me how God had blessed our relationship. Yes. God did bless our relationship. Are you sure? What if it was your own wish? Your own desire? When you wish for something, you expect God to be on your side. But when your wish doesn't come true, you assume God has abandoned you. And do you feel entitled to return the gesture by abandoning Him? That is not the love you meant. I love you. Love is a gift for those who find it in each other. But it could be a disaster if it goes unrequited, like a knife that cuts into our flesh. Don't be angry anymore. Don't be angry at your dad, your sister, anyone, least of all God. It's my fault. I apologize. When I went to your house, I found this in your bedroom. Our hearts will be at peace as long as we remember no matter where we are. I admit that I am not strong. But... But, I am not that weak as well. - I know. - Hey, just, a little bit... God is great. Assalammu'alaikum. Sit down. Sir. You. You. Answer me. What's the proof that you're Indonesian? Indonesian? You? Are you a Muslim? You. Are you a Muslim? Read the Koran in the name of your God. If he can't read it, shoot him. Shoot him! Enough. Enough. Dear God, please forgive me. My brother. Where do you plan to go now? To Saudi? How do you plan to get there? Mr. Ahmad! Does your brother still work as a ship crew? Yes, he does. May God keep you in His grace. Tomorrow, Tuesday. SHERATON 18401 Here's your pay. Thank you for all your help. I wish you great success. Goodbye now. Thank you. Assalammu'alaikum. Dad... It's your son, Mada. I don't know where you're rested. Forgive me, Dad. Forgive me for being angry at you. For forsaking your teachings. For leaving you. If you were here, I'd kneel and beg for your forgiveness. Dear God. I am so full of regret and shame. My heart is torn into pieces. Only You can forgive my sins. I understand now. All these trials and tribulations have brought me closer to You. I submit to Your injunctions. Lead me to Your way. Lead me. HAJI BACKPACKER 9 COUNTRIES, ONE PURPOSE I will come home soon. I just did my Umrah. I'm going to have a Hajj trip, while I'm here.
