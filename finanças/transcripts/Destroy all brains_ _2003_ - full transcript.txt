Mr. Mousouras, senior editor's birthday lunch... is set for 2 a.m. tomorrow at "Bella Mongolia". Fine. Maria... Hold all lines and don't interrupt me for an hour. I'm busy. I hope my testimony proves useful... for anyone dealing with this case. Let's begin properly. My name is Babis Mousouras, I'm the TV critic... for the newspaper of "Golden Light Hellas". I first heard about Destroy All Brains! from my friend Emilios. It was 3 a.m.. What's up Babis? How's your leg? How's Lena? - We broke up six months ago! - Why didn't you tell me, man? Are you OK? Want me to come? I might catch the last flight. Don't worry. I'm OK. Wait a second. How are things? Your computer games? Finishing a new one where you are a cocaine baron in Switzerland... and you have to beat the other cartels. Never mind! I saw the best film of all times! - Destroy All Brains! You know it? - First time I hear. 60's production, miserable Technicolor, written by... that guy who wrote for Charlie's Angels, who killed himself in '72. The plot? Unbelievable, can't describe it, you have to see for yourself. Sort of James Bondish about an illuminate sect... conspiring to take over the world... using secret Chinese brainwashing techniques... Later man. I'm very busy. 2 days later I got a postcard from Emilios. It went like this: "Hey. Came to stay in Thailand." "Got a job with major heroine dealers." "Building them an electronic network." "Send all correspondence via diplomatic pouch‚Äù I heard again about "Destroy all Brains"... when I interviewed my old friend, George Papageorgiou. It was not exactly my field but George, a famous manager... was a friend and used to be an agent in Hollywood 10 years ago. What exactly is Project "Janus"? Terumitsi Yamada. Rings any bell? President of Golden Light International. Your boss in Tokyo. He was to meet the Emperor for a bridge session. The Emperor stood him up. So he had a walk in the palace gardens, you know, waiting. Enjoying the silence. He saw two eyes in the sky looking down on him. Evil eyes. He had an apocalyptic vision. There was this case with toxic infant food products too... You know, he lost it. He was convinced that the Universe chose this way... to remind him there's a dark and evil side in life. Are you for real? He published his experience in "Global Manager"... along with a scheme for Project "Janus". All corporate executives are obliged... to volunteer for community service... so that they encounter the miserable side of life. Some get a prison, others get an orphanage. I got 4 immigrants from Upsala, Sweden. I help them learn Greek, build a life here. How long have you been with them? Ever heard of a film called "Destroy all Brains!"? - Once. - 50's science fiction. You know, alien invasion to Earth, flying saucers... Lee Van Cleef in his youth acted, or someone who looked like him. Or someone whose name sounded like Lee Van Cleef. The aliens looked like 50's TVs, you know... Made of wood... Huge antennas. State of the art for the time. Funny how they walked... I don't remember much. I'm not even sure how it ended. Let me introduce you... Hans Christian... Babis... The CD store was completely destroyed from the attack... while lesser damage... Next day I was in my office writing the review... for "3001-Final Odyssey"... when the bulletin came in. The Chairman was in the nearby CD store during the attack... where he was buying CDs for his daughter... according to our exclusive sources. The perpetrator is George Papageorgiou... vice president of Golden Light Europe's Audiovisual Sector... who has no previous history of terrorist involvement. Apparently the Swedes were Upsala freedom fighters... distributing Russian porn videos... then using the money they made to buy weapons... for their comrades in Upsala. George bought from them an Iraqi made UZI... went to a crowded shopping centre ... and destroyed a home appliances shop. The Chairman, who suffered a severe shock... As the Chairman was carried I saw a poster ... advertising the soundtrack of "Destroy All Brains!". I went down to the store but they had never heard of it. The perpetrator was transferred to a high security prison. We'll get back to this breaking story... with a round table discussion... on the rising wave of terrorist activity... Went to see Zechariahs at the university. I told him about Emilios and George. The answer to the question what is Enlightenment... lies more in the question than in the answer that is due. It lies mainly in who answers, when he answers... in the meaning of the question, and in what replaces Enlightenment... if not Enlightenment itself. You might wonder what all these have to do with... the semiotic approach to the works of Schloendorff. The answer to this question... will follow after a short commercial break. Sorry for this. You caught me in a bad moment. -Well? -I've seen the film too. A few days ago. - Nothing strange happened to me. - How can you tell? Well... I saw it on Channel 68 Satellite. You saw "Destroy All Brains!" on TV? - Last Wednesday. - It was not programmed! Last minute substitution I guess. Rather strange case. And I've seen many odd things. I didn't spot the copyright in the credits. I'd place it...around '38. Black and white of course. From the sloppy editing I'd say it was issued as a serial. The director was one of those half-forgotten guys. - The cast? - Anonymous. Though I thought I saw Einstein in a crowd scene. But they could've used archive footage to save money. What's important is the film's plot. The plot... Yes. Really hard to describe. It was mostly about some crazy Haitians performing voodoo... to enslave the political leaders of America. There was a dance-around-the-fire scene featuring total nudity! Is this possible? If it was shot National Geographic style. If you watch it we need to discuss the relevance of the film. - See you soon. - Yeah, soon. Returned home worried. In the evening news, Zechariahs was the lead story. He had killed the new Mayor... using a model airplane... loaded with Czech plastic explosives. The Vice Mayor was a collateral damage. Zechariahs escaped disguised as the ambassador of Saudi Arabia. No, I am not mistaken! This is Channel 68, right? And you've never screened "Destroy All Brains!" ? Are you sure about the title? I broke. I called Lena. What's up? You sounded very strange on the phone. What's this mess? How many times I wanted to see you, call you! -You have to go? -I must. You're staying in? Look, whatever's wrong with you, you can't go on like this At least try to work a bit. I have a great idea for an article! A brilliant film you definitely have to rent. - It's called... - Destroy All Brains! You've seen it? No, but it seems everyone I know has. Then you must know it's much above average for a TV movie! Sure! Mid-Seventies I'd say... Probably Aaron Spelling's or maybe not. It featured that singer who was in that soap opera... Or was it a western? And that child actress who later became a porn star. The American government hired them and sent to the Gulf... to break the oil embargo. Are you listening? The most intriguing thing was that they met Lawrence of Arabia... - And Richard Burton! - Elizabeth Taylor's husband? Not him! The other one, who discovered the sources of the Nile! He and Lawrence were still alive! Immortal masterminds behind all political conspiracy in the Middle East. What happened after that is really hard to describe... Gotta go. Call you around 2. Nothing. Just take great care now, OK? When I heard Lena married the King of Jordan... I was not a bit surprised... A week later a film critic... saw "Destroy All Brains!" at a Normandy drive-in. He described it as the 1st intergalactic thriller of the new millennium Shortly after that he became a Zen Buddhist in Kuala Lumbur. Last night... I read about a university party in Boston, that took place... 10 days ago. According to the Boston police for no apparent reason... the party ended up to a 3 day riot with lots of casualties... and material damages... Before the violent outburst there had been a 16mm screening... of an old porn film... about the Los Angeles sex orgies of the 40's... called... When the 10th friend called me up about "Destroy All Brains!"... I quit answering the phone. I'd hear about all those calling from the news, anyway. As for me... I just waited.
