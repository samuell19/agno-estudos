It's very good, thank you, Mrs. Bloom. - What I meant was, we've hardly seen or heard from you in years, and then you call from the dock, and you asked us to come and pick you up, so my question is, what are you doing? - Arthur, leave the boy alone. - That's exactly the point, Mary, he's hardly a boy anymore. So, how old are you now? - I'm 31. - He's 31 years old, so he can answer a simple question by sitting at our table, he can tell us where he's been. - You don't have to answer any questions, Will, and you're always welcome here. - It's okay. Uh, I've been, um, I've been away. - Away. Where? - Away, all over. - [Arthur] All over? - Yeah, pretty much all over. - I see, alright. Uh, so, uh, what have you been doing all this time? - I've been, I've been writing a book, mainly. - A book? - Yeah, and, uh, now that I've finished, the publisher who's publishing my book wanted me to come back here. - That's wonderful. - So, what's it about? - Nothing. - Nothing? Uh, what does nothing mean? - Maybe it means that he'd rather not talk about it right now. - Well, if he doesn't want to talk about it, well, then he can say so. - I would rather not talk about it. - Ah, there you go. So we're not going to talk about it. I mean, you have to admit he does seem a bit crazy. - Arthur, please. He's just a little lost, that's all, after all he's been through. - Mm hm. - He didn't say a word about Maggie. Well, he hardly mentioned Daniel. What do you think about that? - Well, how would I know? How would either of us know? I've hardly ever seen Daniel in the last few years, Mr. New York City. - And whose fault is that? - When did I say it was anyone's fault, I'm saying we've hardly ever seen the boy. - Our son. - Right, okay, yeah, thanks very much. He's not the boy, he is our son. - Well, maybe if you treated him more, with a bit more love. - Maybe if you didn't smother him. Mother's love can be complicated. - Of course, it's all my fault, isn't it? - Okay. That's enough for me. - Uh huh. - [Arthur] Goodnight. - Fine, goodnight. Sweet dreams. Oh. - [Arthur] Mm hm. (solemn music) (night bird calling) - [Arthur] Well, that was delicious. - Yeah, thanks, Mrs. Bloom, it was really good. - Will, you're welcome. Oh, you know, I, uh, I almost forgot. Daniel called last night after you went to bed and said that he was going to come up for the weekend, so he should be arriving at some point today. - Great. - The big reunion. - [Will] Yeah. - Will, I, I don't want to pry at all, really, I just, you and Daniel, you used to be so close. - Yeah, it seems like all that was a long time ago. I guess we just drifted apart. - Well, maybe now you'll find you have more in common. - Yeah, maybe. You know, I was thinking, if, uh, you don't mind, I might go for a little fishing. - Fishing, now there's a good idea. It's been years since there's been any fishing around here. (hum of boat) (peaceful music) - I'll just get this out. And see just how much we have in common. Oh, we have plenty in common, huh? Yeah, now that wasn't so bad. You little bastard. - Will, wait, wait, wait. Let me get a picture. That's a big fish. - Okay. - That's three or. That's three or four pounds. Okay. Perfect. - That was Daniel. He's over at the dock. You want to go pick him up, Will? - Sure. - Great. Very nice. (buzzing motor) - [Daniel] Hey, there, pal. You look like shit. - [Will] Thanks, man, yeah, you look great. I can barely remember the last time I saw you. - Yeah, I'm sure you can't. Will, what are you doing? - Picking you up. So come on. Your parents are anxious to see you. They say you never visit. - I'm very busy these days. - Oh, yeah, that's right. I heard about that, the book. That's great, man. Congratulations, bro, I'm so happy for you, that's, that's amazing. Your parents must be really, really proud. I know I am. - Shut up. - [Will] You know, it's so great to see you again, it really is. - [Daniel] Yeah. Move over, I'm driving. - [Will] It's your boat. - [Daniel] That's right, it is my boat. - You want me to do that? - Nope. - You've got to really pull, just fucking give her, you know? - [Daniel] I know how to start. (sputtering engine) Goddamn engine. - Nice one. (humming engine) - Well, hello there, stranger. - [Daniel] Hello, Father. - Welcome back. - Dad. - So, how was the trip? - [Daniel] Fine. - Your mother can't wait to see you, but first there's something I need to show you. - [Daniel] Okay. - Rotten to the core. It's a good old tree, but, uh, you know, it's got to come down. I was going to pay Duane to do it, but now that I have you two, tomorrow, what do you say? - [Daniel] Do you have everything? - Yeah, I have everything. - Tomorrow okay with you, Will? Nothing important to do? Disappear for another five years, and. - No, I don't think so. - Then it's settled. Tomorrow, we take down the tree. - Look, not to dwell on the small things, but really what the hell are you doing? - Nothing, what are you doing? - Alright, well, I tried. - Fuck you, you tried. - [Daniel] Fuck you. - No, fuck you. - [Daniel] Fuck you. - No, fuck you. - [Daniel] Fuck you. - Fuck you. - [Daniel] Fuck you. - Ah, bass. Flaky, almost fart-ass taste, you never, you know, forget it, do you? - [Arthur] Nonsense, bass is a wonderful eating fish. - [Daniel] Mm. - [Mary] So, how's New York? - [Daniel] Hm, busy. - [Mary] Mm hm. - Really busy, um, things at the magazine are just crazy, you have no idea the stuff that happens. Like, you know, just like the other day, I was out for lunch, and um, we had just written this um. No, never mind, it's stupid. - What? - No, no nothing. You just, you wouldn't get it. Anyway, New York, uh, we just put the new issue to bed, which is good. Um, then there's the book, that whole thing just keeps going on. You know, the interviews, and readings and all kinds of. - And the movie. - The movie, yeah, there's a. - [Mary] The movie. - Yeah, now there's this movie. Um, um, things are uh, things are just very busy, Mother, very, very busy. - Mm hm. Did you know that Will has written a book? - A book, really? What kind of book? - Traditional, standard, pocket-sized. - [Daniel] Oh, that's cute. - [Mary] And he has sold it, haven't you, Will? - That's right. - Really, so it's going to be, uh, published, and sold in stores just like a real book? - Just like a real book. - [Arthur] Ask him what it's about. - What's it about, Will? - Nothing, really. - [Daniel] Really, so it's like a special, secret kind of book? - I just really don't feel like talking about it, that's all. - Okay, good point, because the way you've been going on and on, blah, blah, blah, it's really getting tiresome, so enough about you. Let's talk about me some more. - Oh, yeah, your father was actually wondering about the title, Summer Babe. What does that mean? - That's true. What does it mean? - Uh, I forget. - You forget? You can't forget. - Sure I can, people forget all the time. - What's wrong with you two? One forgets, and the other says nothing. Will you just answer a simple question? - Okay, fine, it's a metaphor. - For what? - Uh, I don't know, how about for a thing you want, but you can't have. - So why can't you have a summer babe? - Because you can't, because she's dating the lifeguard. Or she's visiting her aunt before school starts, or, I don't know, it's not the point. - Alright, what's the point? - The point? - Yeah. - The point is you can't always get what you want. - Oh, that is so true, Daniel. You can't always get what you want. Isn't it also true that sometimes, if you try, you might just get what you need? You might get what you fucking need? I'm sorry, Dr. Bloom, Mrs. Bloom. I'm not feeling too well. - [Mary] Certainly, Will. - [Daniel] Leaving so soon? - Yeah, something's making me feel sick. - [Mary] What was that all about? - [Daniel] Nothing. (thud) Actually, excuse me. - Well, it wasn't the fish. - [Daniel] How about some ping-pong for old times' sake? - Oh, no thanks. - How about for old times' sake you answer the question Will, what the fuck are you doing here? - Hm, what am I doing here? Hm. I don't know, what, what could I possibly be doing here? Oh, that's right. The last time I saw you, you were in this room. And you, you were fucking my wife. - Alright, it's not that simple, man, you know that. - [Will] It's not that simple? - No. - Did you or did you not fuck my wife? - But you know, this is stupid. This is, this is stupid. - Did you fuck my wife? - [Daniel] Huh, are you serious? - Yeah, you bet I'm fucking serious. - Of course I fucked your wife. You were there, Will. You walked in, you saw us, so, we all know, everybody knows who fucked who. What's your point? - My point is that, uh, I'm finally going to fucking kill you! - Fuck you, stay away. - [Will] What the fuck? Come here! - [Daniel] Fuck. (scuffling and groaning) You fucker, you fuck off. Fuck off! - [Will] Fuck you. - Fucker. (clattering and grunting) - What are you boys doing? - Nothing. - Nothing. - Right. Well, Maggie's waiting at the dock. - What? - What's she doing at the dock? - [Mary] I called her. - You called her? - You called her? - Of course I called her. - Mrs. Bloom, I can't believe you did that. - Really? Well, believe it, Will. Now, go on, both of you. Get going, she's waiting. Go on. And Will, I think she's been waiting long enough. - [Will] Ah, I can't believe your mom called her. - [Daniel] Oh, I know, what a surprise. - [Will] Yeah, I'm surprised. - Yeah, I'm sure you are, what a surprise that they would call me, and then they would call her. I mean, what a fucking shocker. - [Will] Shut up. - You shut up. Are you coming, what are you doing? - Of course I'm coming. - Well, then untie the boat, you idiot. Let's go, come on. - Jesus Christ. I'm driving. - Oh, you're driving right now? - Yeah, I'm driving. - [Daniel] Oh, okay. You drive, killer. Don't touch me. (humming motor) - [Daniel] Hey there, Maggie. Fancy meeting you here. - Hello, Daniel. (slap) (somber music) - So? How's it going? - I think I'd better go talk to him alone. - Uh, yeah, I wouldn't do that. You know he just tried to kill me? - Well, I guess I'll have to take my chances. - This isn't a good idea. - [Maggie] Yeah, I know. Will? Will? Will, where are you? - [Will] Go away. - I am so angry. You have no idea how angry I am. - Oh, you're angry. That's funny, because I'm pretty upset myself. - Come here, Will. - What for? - Because this is it. Your one big chance to tell me, to explain what happened. - I think you know what happened. - What? You got kidnapped by pirates? Hit on the head, and woke up with your memory gone, or did someone cut out your tongue, and chop off your hands so that you couldn't write or call me in five fucking years, you motherfucker? - I had my reasons. - Daniel was not a reason. - Oh, no? Actually, he was a reason, in fact, he was a very, very good reason. - I let him put his cock in me. And that is the big problem here for you, that is the big fucking problem. - Of course that's the problem, what else could the problem possibly be? - [Voiceover] The scientists are saying after careful study of the temperature of records, they believe. - Hey, did you pick her up alright? - Uh, more or less. - [Mary] Yeah, how's she doing? - She's great. - Come sit down. - I'm tired, Mother. It's been a long, strange day. I'm just going to go to bed. Night. - You hardly said a word to him. - You seem to be doing such a good job. - [Mary] How've you been? - Good. Pretty good, till now. - I'm sorry, but I had to call. - Oh, God, don't be sorry. No, Mary, I'm glad you called. - Still, it must be a bit of a shock. - Oh, yeah, it's a shock. - But maybe it could've been worse, you know. Maybe, you know, if he'd never come back, or I don't know. - Yeah, maybe I'm just lucky. - Well, maybe you are. (sad music) - Maggie. Maggie. Maggie, wake up. (Maggie gasps) - [Maggie] Fuck. - [Daniel] Jesus, you scared me to death. - Oh, I scared you. You scared me. Sneaking into my room in the middle of the night. Like some creepy sex offender. - [Daniel] Yeah, sorry, but I thought, you know, with everything you might need to talk. - [Maggie] Well, that's very thoughtful, but what I need is for you to go back to your bed, and to go to sleep. - I could do that. That's definitely one of the things I could do. - Of all the things considered, I think that would be the best one. - Okay, if that's what you want. - [Maggie] It's what I want. - Night. Sure you don't need anything? A glass of water? - [Maggie] No. - [Daniel] No? Extra blanket? - [Maggie] No. - [Daniel] A Swedish massage? - Go to bed! - Okay, I'm. You know, I would love to stay, I really would, but, I can't so, that's it. Night. (birds chirping) Hey, how about that tree? - You know, I think it could wait till later. - Oh, I don't know, early to bed, early to rise, all that early stuff, it's very, very important. (clunk) - [Will] Morning. - Jesus, did you get any sleep? - No, I've been reading Cosmo. Researching women, looking for answers. - How's that going? - It's good. Was it the cunnilingus? Was I just no good down there working the box? - No, you were fine down there, I thought you were dead. At first I waited. Everyday, for the phone, the doorbell, a letter. And when it didn't come, when it never came, I thought, &quot;Well, he must be dead.&quot; - Yeah, well maybe I was dead. You ever think about that, maybe I was? - Yeah, well, maybe you're right, maybe you are. - [Daniel] Willy boy! Willy boy! Up and at them. Hey, my father wants us to cut down the tree. Oh, hey, Maggie. How you doing? How'd you sleep? - Like a log, thanks. - Ah, me too. Country air, I could just sleep and sleep. You know, it's very refreshing stuff. Ah, nothing like a. good night's rest. In the country. - Can't you see that we're talking here? - Yeah, I'm sorry, but you know my father, if he wants to do the tree now, we've got to do the tree now, so. So, come on. Chop, chop. Let's do it. Will, come on, let's go. (buzzing) - Ready? - Yeah. - [Arthur] Pull it tight, keep some tension on it. Ready? - Yeah. Let's go. - [Arthur] Oh, look out! - [Daniel] Whoah! (crash) - What the hell happened? - Sorry, my fault. I slipped, sorry. - Sorry, you're fucking sorry? - Are you okay? - No! Fuck! - Well, you look okay, and that's the main thing, right, I mean, wow, that was pretty scary. I'd bet anyone would've run away like that. - I didn't run away, I could've been fucking killed! - [Will] Wow, I know, that that, that was pretty close. - Shut up, you shit giggle motherfucker. - [Will] You shut up. - [Daniel] Shut up! - [Will] You shut up. - [Daniel] Fuck you! - [Will] Fuck you. - Hey, hey, hey, hey. Break it up, break it up. Hey come on, you slipped, you ran away, nobody got hurt, no! We, we've got work to do, so let's get back and get it cleaned up, and watch your language, around the ladies. - I'm not the runner away around here. - Sure looked like you were running. - [Daniel] Shut up. (shrill scream) (clatter) - [Daniel] What happened? - Oh, a big snake. - [Daniel] Did it bite you? - No, but it's in the house. - How big was it? - It's really big. - [Arthur] What's really big? - The snake that's in the house. - There's a snake in the house? Well, uh, you boys, you better go in and get it out. - What's that for? - For the snake. - I don't think he plays much. - It's for guidance. - You do not guide snakes. Grab them by the neck, just behind the jaws. It takes lightning reflexes, and nerves of steel, Willie Boy. - Don't call me that. Oh, my God, there it is. - [Daniel] Where? Where? - Right there. - What'd it look like? - It looked like an elephant, like a long, skinny elephant. - Okay, let's go. - Good thing you're an expert. - [Daniel] Shut up. Okay, um, just help me move this thing. - Alright. - Okay, I'll go in. While you head around the other way, and cut off his avenue of escape. Okay. - Okay. - [Daniel] Alright. - How's it going down there? - [Daniel] I told you, head around the other side, cut off his escape route. - Oh, my God, it's right on top of you! (Daniel hollers) - [Mary] Well, that doesn't sound too good. - Hey, in there. Are you boys alright? - [Daniel] Yeah, we're fine, it was just a little false alarm. That was hilarious. - I thought we should test your snake catching reflexes. - My reflexes are fine. - And you said something about nerves of steel? - The nerves are steely, okay? - Good, cause there he is. - Where? - [Daniel] I got, I got it. Get out of my way. - [Will] Get him. - [Daniel] I'm getting him. - [Arthur] Whoah. - [Mary] Oh, my. (applause) - [Arthur] Wow! - [Mary] Wow. Fantastic! - [Arthur] Wow. - Yeah, I caught it, he was just on the chair in there. - Alright, follow. What up! (splash) Sorry, Will. Ah, yeah. (shredding) - You know, I could've caught that snake. - Yeah, I'm sure you could've. - Yeah, I mean, it's not that hard, you just got to grab them real quick, behind the jaws. You just got to have lightning reflexes. - Well, I don't care about the snake. - Look, I'm sorry. I just don't know what to say to you. - Why don't you start small? Tell me what you've been doing the last five years. - Okay. I mean, not much, really, just been travelling all over the place, and working a bunch of equally dumb jobs. - Did you have a girlfriend? - Girlfriend? No. I mean, you know, there's been girls, but no girlfriend. - Here, take these. (clunk) (thud) Oh, uh. I'm really going to have to reach. Ah! (clunk) - You okay? - [Maggie] Yeah. No, I'm okay. - You sure? - Yeah, really, I'm okay. Did you, did you, because it, just before I fell, it felt like. - What? - No, nothing, it just. Did you kiss my ass? - No. I mean, when you fell, maybe, maybe it hit my lips or something. - I don't know, it just, it really felt like, all things considered, you probably should. - Haha, that's funny. I should kiss your ass, very funny. I mean, if, if that's what you're thinking about, if you wanted me to, I would consider it. - No, I'm good, thanks. - Okay. Well, I'll see you. - Okay, see you. (serene music) - [Daniel] Hey. - Oh. - Do you have any cigarettes? - No, I quit smoking. - I have one left. Well, I think we've both always known that Will's a little special. But uh, I think he's gotten worse, I mean, five years out there, sleeping in ditches, or whatever he's been doing, he's, I think he's flipped his wig this time. - He's not crazy. - Oh, come on. I think we should get him the help he needs. - Sure, except that he's not crazy. - Oh, okay. Well, if that makes you feel better, fine, he's not crazy, but when we all end up decapitated in some shallow grave with our mouths full of dirt and sodium toysyl. - I promise not to mention it. - Mm. Alright. It's good to see you. You know, I mean with everything. - Yeah. - You never answered my letters. - I know. - I just kept writing them. And, you know, was sure you'd moved. - No, I got them all. I just couldn't write back. Not after everything. - It's alright. There is something else I've been thinking about though. - What? (forlorn strains of music) Okay, that's wrong. - What's wrong? - You know what. - No, I don't. - It wasn't worth it, Daniel. It wasn't anywhere near worth it. - Yes it was. - No, it wasn't. (solemn music) (birds chirping) - So, when war finally ends, and Bartholomew's brigade is disbanded, most of them light out for the Indian territories, but Bartholomew, he goes back to Kentucky only to find, yeah, that Nate is left for France, never to return, so, that of course changes everything, and he's restful. - [Will] Morning everybody. - [Arthur] Oh, hi, Will. Daniel was just telling us about his next novel. - Oh, happy day. - Yeah, so where was I? Was it the, uh. - Nate had left for France. - Right, so, um to mend his broken heart, Bartholomew decides to throw himself into work, and uh, first starts by uh, entering into the fur trading business, and uh, falls in with this gang of rather shady French Canadian fur trappers led by this fierce matey woman named Marie Jzie Jalah Castor, uh, Socrate. - Oh, I mean, don't mind me. Sorry. - Who ironically enough lost her right leg during a, uh, tragic beaver trapping, uh, mishap. Anyway, so Bartholomew, even though he's gay, he finds himself kind of irresistibly drawn to this fiery half-breed amputee, and. - You know, it's like watching the shit streaming out of some dead elephant's ass. - Shut up, Will. You're ruining Daniel's story. - Oh, no, Daniel's story. Ah, God forbid, I wouldn't want to ruin Daniel's story, I'm sorry. Go on. - Thanks. - You sick motherfucker. - Fuck you. - Hey, that's enough. - No it's not, it's not enough. In fact, it's no where near enough. - It's enough for me. - Yeah, of course it's enough for you, you've always had enough. I never had anything. I never had anything. The one thing I had, you had to take it. - Right, this is where the violins start for the poor little orphan boy, is that it? - Fuck you! (clunk) Fucking, fucking, fucking piece of shit, motherfucker! - I said that's enough. - What do you know about enough? You don't know anything about enough. You did it again. You cheating. (thud) - That was a nice punch. - Sorry, but you're acting like an idiot. - [Will] Ow. Yeah, you're right. Thanks. - You okay? - Oh, yeah, I'm great. - Good, because we're not done yet. - [Will] Oh, yes we are. - Will, stop. (easy music) Will! (slosh) That fucker. (humming motor) Will, get in the boat. - [Will] No, thanks. - [Maggie] Get in the boat. - [Will] No. - [Maggie] Okay, fine. Will, give it up, get in. - [Will] I haven't even begun to swim. I saw you with Daniel last night. You did it again. - [Maggie] You saw us? For that one minute? - [Will] Just one minute? That's all it was? - [Maggie] That's all. - [Will] You know what, Maggie? I think I'm starting to get just a little tired. I'm sorry. - Yeah, me, too. I really am. - If I don't make it, there's a, there's this thing for you in my suitcase. ♪ He almost walked into a wall ♪ Oh, man, she was a sight to see ♪ And at the party down the hall ♪ He said you are the highest apple ♪ In the tree ♪ Out the window in the harbor he saw ♪ A little ship ♪ The moon was orange just slightly ♪ On the right ♪ And they slow danced so the needle ♪ Wouldn't skip ♪ Until the room was filled with light ♪ And I remember you ♪ And I remember me ♪ The sunshine walking inside you ♪ And the man you could see in me ♪ So I remember me, and I remember you ♪ So many beautiful days in a row now ♪ And the nights were perfect, too ♪ Hand in hand down a waterslide in Chatanooga ♪ They did not hide from love you see ♪ - Okay, true or false. - Daniel, please. No, it has been a long, hard stupid day. - True, but, uh, as you remember, the way this works is, I'll ask, and then you'll answer either true of false. - No. - No? Don't you think it's the least you can do? - Okay, fine. - Okay, true or false. You love me. - False. - Right. Next, you once loved me. - I don't know. - It's technically not an allowed answer, but I'll, uh, I'll take it. Okay, moving on, you will love me? - False. - Really? Oh. You're killing me here. You're really killing me. (thud) (ducks quacking) (thud) (peaceful music) - Daniel, what happened? - Oh, a lot of things. A whole lot of things that I don't think you would understand. - Why not? - Why not? Because they don't really fall within the scope of motherly concern. - Oh, I see. Well, I think that if you talked about it, you'd feel better. - Oh, you know what? I would really love to talk about it, and I'll bet you it would make me feel so much better, but I think at this point, what I really need, is a drink. Here you go, knock yourself out. Where's the liquor? - Uh, it's under the, uh, in the. Is it already cocktail hour? - It certainly is. Want one? - Uh, no thanks. - Your loss. Chin-chin. - Chin-chin. (clunk) (thud) - What did Daniel say? - [Arthur] Nothing, he came in for a drink. - How did he seem? - Like he wanted a drink. - This is a very difficult time for him. - What's difficult? - It is true that you were trained, that you make your living understanding people, and helping them with their problems. That is correct, isn't it? - That is exactly correct. Why? (clunk) Ah, fuck. (birds chirping) - Morning. - Yeah, good morning. - Will! Come on over here, uh, give me a hand. (crackling and snapping) Uh, throw some of that stuff in, I uh, pulled something in my back. - You alright? - Well, yeah, yeah, no it was just a, you know, just a little thing. Now, William, uh, we have known each other, you know, a long time. And I trust you. - I trust you, too. - Well, that's good, that's good that we trust each other because what I'm, what I'm going to tell you, it can never go any further than us. Agreed? - Yeah, sure. - Here, let's shake on that. - Okay, let's do that. This isn't going to be anything too bad, is it? - No, no, no. When we were much younger, Mary had an affair. And the uh, scars, you know, left from that on our marriage, uh, aside from being personally difficult, uh, they complicated our raising of Daniel. Some of us, and both of us, you know, we've always felt that it was a major cause of the problems, you know, Daniel's relationship with his mother, Daniel's relationship with me, and, uh, so, I mean, do you, you see what I am telling you? - Yeah, I think I do. - I am telling you that people, and lots and lots of people, in fact, most people have been through difficult times, and yet somehow they don't go running around like hysterical jackasses, making life impossible for everyone. And, uh, that's what I'm telling you. And I'm telling you that with the best of intentions. As if you were my own son. - Well, I appreciate it, Dr. Bloom. I really do. - [Maggie] So, I read your book. - [Will] Oh, no, why did you do that? - [Maggie] Because you told me to. - [Will] I did not. I was on my death bed, and I only told you where it was so you could destroy it, in the event of my demise. - [Maggie] Well, I thought it was really good. - [Will] Sure, thanks. Stop, please. - [Maggie] Well, you wait and see when it's published. - [Will] Come on, there's no publishers. It was just something I said. I mean, you read it. What kind of idiot is going to publish something like that? - [Maggie] Lots would. And lots of people will like it because, because it's good. - [Will] Good? Compared to what? And even if it was good, who cares? I mean, take a look around. By even the most conservative estimates, we're a good way half to the apocalypse. Just one more school play on the deck of the Titanic. Plus, practically speaking, with the human race so busy snuffing itself out, who's got time to read? - [Maggie] Well, it's nice to see that you haven't lost your cheery outlook. - [Will] Yeah, I know. - Hey. Hey! Ahoy, Ishmael. Tell us of your fascinating travels. - Well, Ahab, there's not much to tell. - Oh, come on. You've been everywhere, across oceans, on the road, out on the street with the people. Come on. Tell us all about it, baby. - Maybe some other time. - [Danie] Okay, okay, okay. Why don't you tell us about the first time you and Maggie met? - You introduced us. - Exactly. I introduced you. I fucking introduced you. Thank you, thank you very much. (radio playing and rhythmic thud of ping pong ball) You two seem to be getting along well again. It's beautiful. Hey, Maggie. - Yeah. - Hey, Maggie. - Yeah. - [Daniel] Did you read my book? - No, no. Not yet, sorry. - No? - No. - Hey. Will, Willie Boy. Willie Boy. Hey, broheisen, did you read my book? - Uh, yeah, I did. - You did? He read my book. So, what'd you think? - I hated it. - Shut up, you stupid communist. Oh, Maggie. Maggie, Maggie, Maggie. Maggie. Why didn't you read my book? - I don't know, I've just been busy, I guess. - Did you know they're making a movie out of it? It's a big, big movie. It's weird, it's a big movie that big stars and they got that guy to do it, the guy, you know, and the girl, too. They got that girl, I had dinner with them, and that director? The director, he directed the big movie, movie, you saw it, I saw it, everybody saw it. It was a big movie, with uh, it's about a rock. Not a rock, a rock, like, a actual rock thing, people would dance on it, and they're famous and stuff. And then, fuck. Anyway, I'm going to go in here, because it's like weird and you're all full of shit. - Phew. You know what's strange? It's like lately every time I smoke pot, it's like I'm getting stoned, really weird. (Maggie coughs) - Wow, that is weird. - Yeah. Can I ask you a personal question? - Okay. - Huh? - Okay. - Is that Mars? - It definitely could be. - What are you doing? - [Maggie] What does it look like? (splashing) - [Will] How is it? - [Maggie] Uncomfortably hot. - [Will] It looks cold. - [Maggie] Come on in. - [Will] What, me? No way. Ah, it's freezing! - [Maggie] Yeah, but it's not that cold. It's not the cold we have to worry about. It's good news. - Oh, so I think we've finally come to the big moment. Why did you sleep with Daniel? - The truth? - Oh, hell, at this point, why not? - I wanted to. Of course, afterwards, it seemed like a terrible mistake, but, at the time, I just, I wanted to. Maybe I was a bit jealous, maybe that had something to do with it. - Jealous, jealous of who? - Jagger, who do you think? - Daniel? It's not like we're gay. Not that there's anything wrong with being gay. - You seem a little gay. - Alright, but not like physically gay with sperm all over everything. Maybe a little queer, I'll give you that. - Thanks. Okay, your turn. - Truth? - Don't stop now. - I guess at first, I just wanted to make you pay. Or something. But then, as I kept going, I just didn't want to stop. So I kept going and going and going, till I wasn't there anymore. I guess it was kind of like trying to commit suicide, without actually doing it. And that would hurt. - Okay, well, that was depressing. - Yeah, I know, it's killing my buzz. - Change of subject. - Oh, guess what Arthur told me earlier? He told me Mary had an affair. - [Maggie] Wow, why would he tell you that? - [Will] I don't know, something about not being so stupid all the time. - [Voiceover] Yeah, oh, oh. - [Voiceover] Yeah, yeah. (pleasurable moaning) (gasps, panting and moaning) (moaning and groaning) - I saw him in the kitchen. He's a little drunk. He's emotional. We're going fishing in the morning. - You two are going fishing in the morning? - Yes. - I'd better go check on him. What are you doing? - I really, really like this new satellite dish. - Turn it down! What is wrong with you, Daniel? This is just outrageous the way you're carrying on. - I'm in love. In love, Mother, that's what's wrong with me. What's wrong with you? The way you've carried on? Hm? (stumbling steps) (thud) - He's gone. He must've gone up to bed. - Yep. - Yeah. - I should go, too, and get some sleep. - You could sleep here, I mean, technically, we are still married. - No, we're not. - What, you divorced me? - Five years, buddy, you better believe I divorced you. - Well, goodnight. - So? - He's fine. Night. - Night. - [Daniel] Hey, Willie Boy. Will? Will? - Hey. - Hey, come on, I have marshmallows, and scotch. Just like when we were kids. - Right. I'll be right down. (clunk) Daniel? Daniel? - Hey, am I in the right hole? Shoot off. The legs are my rivals, just stand still, man. (clunk) Aw. - You okay? - [Daniel] Yeah. - Come here, give me your hand. - [Daniel] Jesus, be careful, man. - [Will] Sorry. Where are those marshmallows? - [Daniel] Yeah. I'm sorry. I really am sorry for, you know, fucking your wife. I'm not just saying that, I, I'm, I'm, I really mean it. - Well, thanks. Yeah, I'm sorry, I, uh, I tried to kill you and all that. - [Daniel] That's alright. (laughter) I'd do it again though, in a second. - [Will] Yeah, me too. - [Daniel] You would? - [Will] Why'd you do it? - [Daniel] I loved her, from the first moment I saw her. I think about her all the time. - [Will] You still think about her? - [Daniel] No. Well, yeah, but, you know, not a lot, just a little. You? - [Will] Yeah. All the time. - [Daniel] Yeah. - So, now, you and I are going to talk. - [Daniel] Oh, Father, please. - Well, these things, they need to be discussed. - I'll throw up. - [Arthur] Nevertheless, I'm going to have to insist we talk about your problems. - My problems, why don't we talk about your problems? - What problems? I don't have any problems. - [Daniel] Sure you do. - No, I don't. - Look, I know all about it, okay? Mother's affair? I know everything. Here, you'll feel better. - Hey, no, it's six o'clock in the morning here. - Exactly. Come on. Alright. Alright. Well, let's begin. Tell me, tell me all about it. - Have you been talking with Will? - No, I totally hate that guy. - [Arthur] Well, then, who? - I've been talking to Mother. - [Arthur] Your mother told you? - That's right, Mother told me, last night. - I don't believe that. - Well, believe it, Father, because she told me the whole, crazy mixed up story, just not your crazy mixed up side of it. So, come on. Let it all out. - Alright. Uh, we'd only been married a, it was a short time, it was, you know, it was a year, maybe two, um, I was still interning at the hospital, you know, I was, I was working very long hours. Very long hours, and, uh, we weren't having regular, relations, at the time, and, it, it was a lonely time for both of us, it was very, it was very lonely. And I don't blame your mother for what happened, Daniel, and I've always loved you, as you were my own son. And no father has ever loved his son more, and it's, it's very, very important that you know that. - Wait, what are you talking about? - The affair. And the, then your. (clatter) Last, last night, your mother, she told you? The affair, and the, then everything? - Wait. You're not my father? Is that, is that what you're telling me? - Isn't that what she told you? - No. (slosh) - [Arthur] Daniel, get back in the boat. Get back in the boat. - Maggie, what happened with you and Will and Daniel? - I think that's probably something you should hear from someone else. - Married couple? And their best friend? And they're all very close, and then one day, it's too close. - Yeah, that sounds about right. It happened here. I mean, I mean, not here in this room, but, Will went fishing, and, Daniel and I, were in the boathouse, and Will came back early, and he walked in, and there we were. And then he was gone. I can't believe that I'm crying. (Maggie sobs) - [Mary] It's okay, don't worry. It's going to be okay. - Hey, what's cooking? - Oh, my God, Daniel, what happened to you? Where's your father? - Well, that's a good question. Where's my father? And, another good question would be, who's my father? - Don't be crazy I don't want you to. Your father is your father, now you go on and dry off. - [Daniel] Oh, no, no, no, no, no, Mother. That's not what I mean. What I mean is who is my actual real father? - You know what, I don't know what you're talking about. - Well, I know, Mother. Father just told me everything, except who's my father, so, I really think the best thing would be for you to tell me the truth. - It's Tom. - Tom? - It's Tom Morrison. Will's. - Will's dad is my father. - Yeah. - Well, that's awesome. That's um, that's fucking awesome. - [Maggie] Mary. - What? - Mary. (rippling water and birds chirping) - Hey, there. - Well, don't you look nice. - [Maggie] Tell me about your dad. - [Will] You know the story. - [Maggie] Tell me anyway. - [Will] They got married, had me. And one day, he went out and never came back. - [Maggie] Why do you think he left? - [Will] Well, I've always suspected alien abduction. - [Maggie] So you don't have any idea? - [Will] No, not really. - [Maggie] That could've been you. - [Will] Yeah, I suppose. - [Maggie] Did you ever think that, when you were out there? Did you ever think, &quot;Hey, look at me, &quot;I turned out just like my dad?&quot; - [Will] It crossed my mind. - I know why your dad left. - No you don't. - [Maggie] Do you want me to tell you? - You don't know. - Do you want me to tell you anyway? - [Will] Well, sure, since you don't know, go ahead, tell me. - That affair that Mary had? That was with your father. - My dad and Mrs. Bloom? - [Maggie] And she got pregnant. And that was Daniel. - So, Daniel's my brother? Is that what you're saying? - That is what I'm saying. And he just left, never told your mother a thing, just disappeared. - So that's why he left? That's why I never knew him? God, I'm such an asshole. I've been an asshole my whole life, I'll probably always be an asshole. - [Maggie] I know. (smooth music) - [Mary] Was Daniel out with you? - No. No, I, I haven't seen him since this morning. - Well, let's just hope he's not at the bottom of the lake. - He's not at the bottom of the lake. - [Mary] Maybe we should just call the police. - Well, they won't do anything until he's been missing for two days. - So what, we're just supposed to sit here and wait? - Or we could play a game. Like strip poker, or naked Twister. See if we can't keep the old family fornication traditions alive. - Fuck you. I have lived with a broken heart for what happened, but I can't do anything about it, and I can't help it if your father disappeared like a scared little boy. (clunk) - Am I going to have to knock you on your ass? - No, Sir, I'm sorry. You see him? - [Maggie] No. He's not up there? - No. I really screwed that one up with Mrs. Bloom, huh? - Yeah, you sure did. - Yeah, well, she did ruin my life. - [Maggie] Oh, yeah, but then everyone ruined your life, didn't they? - [Will] Thank God, finally we're seeing the big picture. - Daniel! - [Mary] Daniel! - [Maggie] Daniel! This is useless. - He can hear us. He just does not want to be found. - I know, I know, I know, I just. - He'll come back. When he's ready. Come on, time to go home. - Then the next morning, we were heading out, then we were going around this bend, I saw a little wisp of smoke, and, at the end of it was Daniel, curled up around this little fire. We had forgotten him all night in the freezing cold. And uh, I jumped out, and I went over to him, and uh, he got up very slowly, as if his bones were made of ice, until he was standing straight up, he punched me right in the mouth, and knocked me back. He broke my tooth, this one, it's, it's a cap. So, I guess, what I'm trying to say is uh, you know, don't worry too much about Daniel. He'll be okay. - Thank you, Will. - He'll be alright. - No, I know. I just worry will we ever see him again after this. - Did it hurt when he punched you? - What? Oh, that, no, I made that up. - Shut up. - Well, make them feel better. - Daniel will be okay, won't he? - Yeah, he'll be fine. - Well, that was nice of you, then. To tell them a story to make them feel better. - Yeah, I guess. - I love you. - I love you, too. (soft music) - [Daniel] You going somewhere? - Jesus, Daniel. You scared the shit out of me. - Sorry. - You okay? - Yeah. - Good. I'll leave the boat at the dock, you can pick it up later. - Okay. What am I going to tell him? - I don't know. Make something up. You're good at that. - Alright, I'll make something up. - [Maggie] Goodbye. - Bye. (rumbling motor) - [Will] Good morning. - [Daniel] You know it's not. - Yeah, you're right, it's a terrible morning. Maggie's gone. - I know, I saw her. - You did? - Yep. - So, did you talk to her? - Yeah. - Did she say anything about me? - Yeah. - Alright, well, come on, let me have it. - She said um, she said you should call her. You should call her and try to make a fresh start. - Okay. Oh, thanks, thanks for sharing that with me. - You're welcome. I guess you heard the other news. - Yeah, I sure did. Little brother. - What the fuck are we supposed to do now? - I don't know, you tell me. Stupid bastard. - [Mary] Will, pass the syrup please. - [Will] Sure. The pancakes are great. - [Daniel] Yeah, they're wonderful. - [Arthur] They are delicious. ♪ Troubles, no troubles ♪ I'm alive ♪ And I can't stand to see you ♪ I can't stand to see you ♪ When you're crying at home ♪ Scotch and penicillin ♪ Please try Carlton ♪ A cold black maple hangar ♪ And husbands on the run ♪ I just got back from a dream attack ♪ That took me by surprise ♪ And in there I met a lady ♪ Her name was Shady Sides ♪ And she said ♪ It's been evening all day long ♪ It's been evening all day long ♪ And how can something so old ♪ Be so wrong ♪ Sin and gravity ♪ Drag me down to sleep ♪ To dream of trains across the sea ♪ Trains across the sea ♪ Half hours on earth ♪ What are they worth ♪ I don't know ♪ In 27 years ♪ I've drunk fifty thousand beers ♪ And they just wash against me ♪ Like the sea into a pier ♪ Mm hm ♪ Mm hm ♪ Mm hm ♪ (gentle guitar music)
