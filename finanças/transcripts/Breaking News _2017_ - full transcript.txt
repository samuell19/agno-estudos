Thanks a lot. - What are you doing? - The cable's broken. - Hurry up! - OK. - Where do we shoot? - In the factory. - Where in the factory? - You heard! Hurry up! I don't think we should go in. They're putting it out. Come on, Paraschiv! Let's see... There's no police cordon. If it takes longer than 3 minutes, Preda might fire us. Stop stressing me, Preda! Let me do my job! Two more minutes. We're inside already. Is he even watching? Preda, are you watching? Still think outside looked better? Let's go, over here! Don't block the exit! Are you kidding? You're waiting for us? Where do we shoot? You want me to dictate Raluca's intro? Let's go there! Write: "Breaking news from inside the factory. " Preda! Speak one at a time! Can we have a bit of quiet, please? Thank you! Start from the boiler and pan back towards me, alright? Ten seconds. - Are the firemen in the frame? - Yes. Five, four, three... Hello, Raluca! We're inside the ELCET factory, where rescue operations are underway as we speak. According to paramedics, 27 people have been evacuated from the factory so far. When the explosion occurred, 32 people were inside the main factory building. At least five people are still buried under the rubble. Yes, it seems the explosion was caused by mishandling the steam boiler. In about 15 minutes, we go live with the fire chief... The ceiling collapsed. All units go to C sector! Hurry up! - Negoita! - Where the fuck is Negoita? Negoita, check the boiler! - There's people upstairs. - Were they from the press? Hurry upstairs! ...an error in handling the boiler. In about 15 minutes, we go live with the fire chief... We do as I told you. There's no police cordon. All this time, no one stopped you? - The fire service didn't kick you out? - No. Pause it. No, play it again. Yes, I can hear you. Give me three more minutes. Like I told you... So there was no police cordon? - You're positive? - No, there wasn't. Stop it. Are you OK? - Want a break? - No, we can go on. Bring him a glass of water, please. What do you think? Who decided to go inside? Does it matter? - We'll see. - Andrei. - The producers didn't ask you to go in? - No. OK. Things are fairly clear. The area wasn't cordoned off, inside or out. The paramedics could have warned you once you were inside but they didn't. There's no risk of legal action. You're fine. I mean... God rest his soul. - Hi. - Hi. - Need any help? - No, thank you. - Hi! Are you OK? - Yeah. We need to issue a statement. I've emailed it you. Please green-light it after the meeting, alright? - How are you feeling? - Fine. Please read the draft of the press release, it needs to go out in an hour. Mazilu, we need to leave for Mangalia tomorrow. What? To start Paraschiv's memorial piece. - Wasn't Voicu doing that? - We've reconsidered. Why? The family won't deal with NTV. It's understandable. But we still need them to talk to us. Why will they talk to me, but not Voicu? Is that a rhetorical question? You were there, they saw you live. It's different. They might talk to you. - This is absurd. - Yeah? You're always answering back! Maybe we should... - Preda, why don't you shut up?! - Really? Yeah, really. Mind your own business! Guys, please... Alex, I know it's hard. Let's do this for Paraschiv. Two or three minutes. Interviews, photos, anything. It's just three days, Mazilu. I'll be there, too, we'll manage. We don't know much about him. He used to commute from Mangalia to Bucharest, he was a widower... Here's his file and CV. That's all we know. ...why do I need to see inside that factory? Should we see people brought out on stretchers? Instead of showing things, we should try to understand them. - How often should you take them? - Every 12 hours. I'll get them tomorrow morning. Sweetheart, give me that. - You went to the bookshop? - Yes. - When? - After the meeting. - Let me help. - It's OK. Go open the door. - It's ugly. - This? - You said you liked it. - No, I don't. You preferred the reindeer? Yes, it was nicer. And the tree's poem is even longer, three verses. - And the Reindeer's wasn't? - No, it wasn't. Daddy, what happened to your hand? - I hurt myself. - How? - I fell. - How? Come on, it's not that bad. It's got lovely branches. Go hold the door for me. - Did I wake you? - No. He only ever lived in Mangalia? Seems like it. I was thinking of going after all. Is it bad if I miss Vlad's play? I'll explain it to him. The Prosecutor's Office began investigating the ELCET explosion. Yesterday, around 3 pm, the factory was shaken by a powerful blast, apparently caused by human error in handling the steam boiler. ...at Radio Funky. This year, Radio Funky Romania has signed a pact with Santa Claus. We bring hits, he brings presents! Will you cut it out? It's almost fucking Christmas! - Come on in! - No, I'm waiting for someone. Marcel! Where have you been? Where's Zoe? OK, OK... I think he's right. He's not so sure Santa doesn't exist. The tree was a different story. If it's been cut down, it's dead. - If it's dead, why is it in the play? - He's right! You're not helping! - What are you doing? - Driving. - And... - And that's all. You're even less talkative than your son. Sorry. Alright. Oh, listen... Send me a picture of the beach, I want to show it. - To Vlad? - Yes. He doesn't believe you're at the seaside. What do you mean? Because it closes during winter. Can you hear me? Say something if you can hear me! Can you hear me? Tell me! Can you hear me? What's your name? - Simona. - Simona who? Simona who? Paraschiv. Paraschiv. Come on, count to ten. One... - Two... One, two... - To ten! - Simona, count to ten! - Wednesday... Wednesday... Let's go outside. Have you been drinking vodka? - You drank a whole bottle of vodka? - Fanta. - What else did you drink? - Wednesday... Easy does it. Where do you live? In Mangalia? Tell me. On Banatului Street? At the shop... What shop? - Did you go to buy liquor? - Seven times. Seven times what? Fifteen. What grade are you in? - Grosu's an idiot. - Who's Grosu? - Tell me... - I'm cold! That's OK, tell me who Grosu is. - I want to go home. - OK, let's go. - I want to go home. - Alright. Why did you go in? - Why did you go in? Tell me! - Let's go! - Simona, let's go! - No, no, no! - Tell me! Why did you go in there? - We were doing our job. - Why? - Come on. Marcel, out of the way! I told you I can do it. Fucking keys! Simona! I'm Andrei's colleague. Alex Mazilu. I know, I saw you on... Sorry to bother you, I brought Simona back. - My condolences. - Thank you. I'm Andrei's aunt. Won't you come inside? Come on in. Hello. Come on in. Take a seat. Virginia, this man is from the TV station, Andrei's colleague. This is Andrei's mother. Hello. Alex Mazilu. Virginia Paraschiv. Are you from Constanta? No, Virgi. The gentleman is from Bucharest. Please, Mr. Mazilu, take a seat. Do excuse me. - Pusa! - Yes? Please serve Mr. Mazilu two plum dumplings? Of course. Did he live here? Andrei? Yes. He moved here with Simona, from Eforie. He came here for Virgi, to help Stefan with the house. It wasn't easy for him, on the road all day. Mangalia-Bucharest, Bucharest-Mangalia. But he didn't want to leave them. - Coca, what time is it? -3:30. - Do you want some dumplings, too? - No, thank you. I wanted to tell you that we're filming a piece about him. It would really help if we could talk to a family member. With Mrs. Paraschiv, or yourself... My brother said the TV station called. You want to make a film? Not really. Just a short report. - But about him, right? - Yes. Well, you see... We'd rather not appear. I spoke to Stefan, Andrei's father. We, the family, would rather not. You know? - I see. - Coca, what time is it? 3:30. Won't you have any? For Andrei's soul. He liked them a lot. - Say: "Thank you, Lord. " - Thank you, Lord. Won't you have any? Who are you, sir? He's Andrei's colleague, from Bucharest. Perhaps you have some pictures of him? - Simona might have some. - Coca, we need walnuts. - Check the pantry. - Coca, you never said: what time is Andrei coming? Here, let me give you some dumplings. - Two dumplings. - Thank you. Are you staying until Saturday? - Where's the toilet? - Down the hall, on the right. Simona? Simona! What do you want? I understand you have some photos of your dad. I don't. We're doing a piece about him. It'd help. Good afternoon. Would you turn the music down, please? Hello. I'm Alex Mazilu, I used to work with... I know. I asked you something, Simona! We don't have any photos and won't give interviews. Can I see you out? Yes, of course. - Mr. Paraschiv... - Yes? We want to do something good for him. Is that what you wanted when you sent him in there? Or was it about ratings? No one forced him. - It was his call. - Please leave, Mr. Mazilu. Of course. Goodbye. - I want them back tomorrow. - Sure. - Can I have your number? - I'm on Facebook. Simona! - Don't you want to talk about him? - And say what? Whatever you like. That he was a selfish idiot, who didn't visit for three weeks? Shall I say that? Didn't think so. Here's a ladybug. I've a few letters left, but I'm too tired. Why aren't you asleep? - Did you find those people? - Yeah. - Is it working out? - It will. How's Vlad? I showed him the pictures of the village and he kept bugging me. He wants to go there instead of Bran. He said he'd learn the poem if we go there. So I booked it. Did you see the pictures? I sent you the link. Listen. If I died, what do you think NTV would say about me? What do you mean? You're pissing me off. What's wrong? Nothing. Let's get some sleep. Alright. I'll call you tomorrow. Get some sleep. I want them. The pictures. I want them back. And delete any copies you made. - What time is it? -07:34. You scanned them? - How did you know where I was staying? - Facebook. Check your settings. - You scanned them, right? - Yes. - Delete them. - Well... Alright, I'll delete them now. Take a seat. Sit down. Watch me delete them all. Select all, delete all. No, I've got other stuff there. Take a seat. How long did you live in Eforie? Ten years. This yard is so cool. - Where were you? - In Costinesti. - He was a DJ? - Yes. Go back. Go back to the video. Yes, I can hear you. Give me three more minutes. Like I told you. There's no police cordon. If it takes more than 3 minutes, Preda might fire us. Preda? Still think outside looked better? Delete all the photos. You forgot these. Thanks. Got a cigarette? Thanks. Why did you go inside that factory? Because we were doing our job. What a shitty job! He wanted to be everyone's hero. Look at him now! I called him 7 times after I saw. Then they pronounced him dead. How was he that morning? I don't know, he was... his usual self. Meaning? He was calm. He was always calm. You could give him the coolest present ever, or tell him to fuck off, he was always calm. - I'm going home. - I'll take you. No, thanks. - Aren't you freezing? - No. Did you drive over there in this car? Yes. Dad's car is still in Bucharest? I think so. The turbo-charged Red Devil. Didn't he make you switch to RockFM? No. Strange. How long was he DJing at Ring? About 12 years. Then they invited him at weekends, when I was younger. He'd take me along. Sometimes he'd forget me there. Once I woke up at Ring and dad wasn't there. It was empty. Except for two guys, drunk on the floor. It was dawn and I started to cry. How old were you? Six. - What did you do? - I just told you. I cried. Someone said he'd gone to the obelisk, so I went to look. I walked from Ring to the obelisk. I found him on the beach. Asleep, fully dressed. Sand in his hair and mouth. I hit him till he woke up. He asked why I was crying. He said: "Stop crying, stop crying. " He said it a hundred times, before I stopped And then he started to sing "Sittin' on the Dock of the Bay". The sun was rising and he sang. - Who sings that? - Otis Redding. - Never heard of Otis Redding? - No. What do you listen to? Smiley? - Is this it? - Yes. - What a shitty song. - Simona! Wait a second. Say something on camera, please. You could say he was calm, listened to Otis Redding. - Taught you about music. - He didn't teach me a thing! I listen to, quote, "Music for deviant brats". Write down this number: 0722... ...678496. Monica Simion. She'll tell you how great he was. Except that he was a selfish idiot. He was mostly in Bucharest anyway. She'll tell you. - Yes? - Hello. Hello. - Alex Mazilu. - I know. I'm Gabi Popa. - Want a chair? - No, it's OK. How is it? You'll see. These were his colleagues in Constanta. Paraschiv never turned you down. If you needed him, he was there for you. Whatever the hour, it didn't matter if it was Christmas or New Year. I worked with him for 5 years. I was sad he left to NTV Bucharest. But it made sense, he was the best. He was a good man. We worked together a lot in Constanta. He'd always surprise you with the things he did. And he never got angry. Something's fake, I don't know what it is. Sorry, I haven't edited this part yet. That's about it. I've got Voicu, Preda, and three others in Bucharest. They all say: great colleague, great guy. We get the point. We can use this. - That he took nice photos? - Yes. What do we do, Mazilu? Mazilu? I don't know if we should air the photos. What? Are you nuts? We've nothing without them. It's lucky we have them. Yes? Hello. Is this Monica Simion? Yes. My name is Alex Mazilu. I'm calling from NTV. Yes? I wanted to talk to you. NTV is making a short piece about Andrei Paraschiv and... I wonder if you'd be willing to have a chat. - Where did you get my number? - From Simona Paraschiv. Mr. Mazilu, please don't call me again. Happy birthday, Daddy! Hi. Do you know where I can find Simona Paraschiv? She's gone to the library. And when she's finished? She won't finish. She has lots of studying to do. Can you show me where the library is? She might be smoking in the alley. Hi. Got ten minutes? - I need to get home. - I can give you a lift. - It's a five-minute walk. - Simo, want me to come? Think I've forgotten my way home? Just saying. - Will we see you on the news tonight? - Mind your own business. - Will we? - No. So, bye. I'm just going to my car. Why did you stop playing guitar? I heard you were as good as Bob Marley. - Who said? - Andrei. What else did you hear? You got first prize in some competition in Constanta. Four years in a row, national record. "Star Melody". Such a lame name. Level One used to come and support me. Three drunk rockers, shouting like crazy. - What's Level One? - He didn't tell you about Level One? He told you about "Star Melody", but not Level One? - So it seems. - It was his band with two other losers. - Does it still exist? - No. One's in the States, one's an alcoholic, and one died two days ago. What else did he say? That he doesn't understand why you don't play anymore. Does the alcoholic still live in Mangalia? Yes. Could he give a coherent interview? Yeah, you might get three words out of him. - Know how to find him? - At his bar, Level One. The Red Devil. Bye. Do you know where Level One is? Just outside Mangalia, I don't know the street. I guess I won't find it online. - Want to come and show me? - No. OK, you won't be interviewed, you won't talk about him, you won't give me photos, but will you please take me there? OK. I'll drop my stuff. - We're taking the Devil. - We're taking my car. - It's parked a million miles away. - It's a five minute walk. Simona... We're taking Red Devil. 48 hours have passed since the tragic accident at the ELCET factory. 20 casualties are still in hospital in Bucharest. Doctors are concerned about five... ...in Floreasca hospital burns unit. Celebrations took place in Targoviste after Santa announced a visit to the town. Dad claimed they never ran dumb stories. Didn't he tell you anything about Monica Simion? No. What else did he say, besides the guitar? - Nothing else. - Turn right here. - How do I find him? - I've no idea. - What's his name? - Curly. I've no idea, but I can ask my granddad, maybe he knows. - You could speak. - About what? About Level One, the three of them, their concerts, how they'd support you in the competition, how he sang Otis Redding for you on the beach, the Red Devil, anything. - I told you I won't talk. - Because you don't feel like it? Yeah, I don't feel like it! Give me the keys. Do you know why he came to your concerts? Why he sang to you on the beach, why he commuted to Bucharest? Because he didn't care, right? Since you know him so well, why don't you do the interview? - Take the passenger seat! - Don't tell me what to do! Simona! Hey! Open the door! Simona! Simona! Fuck! Andrei Paraschiv will be buried tomorrow, at 12 noon, at the Cemetery... His family... ...friends, acquaintances will accompany his final journey... Two minutes, Mazilu! Andrei Paraschiv... will be buried... tomorrow at 12 noon, at the cemetery... Mazilu, did you get a Christmas tree? I can give you one, if you want. No. Is this ok? Want the kids in frame, too? No, no. Just the chapel. - I'll give you a tree, I've got two. - No, thanks. We're ready. Thirty seconds... I'll throw it away, then. You can see the video feed? - What are you doing Mazilu? - I'll be right back. I don't know, Preda! You think yelling at me will solve anything? What the fuck are you doing Mazilu? Right away. What was that about? You crazy? Hello, Laura. We're outside the chapel in Mangalia, where they brought the body of our late colleague yesterday, Andrei Paraschiv. Andrei was a loving father, whose daughter loved him back, a teenager deeply affected by his passing. The two had been inseparable for fifteen years. Andrei's wife passed away when their daughter was just one. Here is one of their precious possessions. - A card from his daughter... - Where did you get that? - made especially for her father. - He stole my card! It seems the two shared a passion for... They cut us off. - Listen! - Give it back! You're an idiot! What the fuck was that? - Let's wrap. - Want them to sue us? That's the plan? - The plan is to finish. - With his daughter swearing on live TV? Fuck this report! Go home then! You couldn't care less about Paraschiv! Mazilu, you're losing it! They keep telling themselves, "It's alright, it'll be alright", but this takes time... Sign here. Thanks. Try to bring it back at a reasonable time! OK. Will your colleague help edit? I don't know. Good thing you didn't drop by on the 25th! It's horrible, isn't it? Vlad... Vlad! Come on, we'll talk later. - OK, but can I tell you the poem now? - Not now. Later. - Just a verse. - Tell it to Mommy! Where is she? I did. She's in the bathroom. - You can tell me later, OK? - Just one verse. "Jack Frost, his hands all frozen, Knocks upon the gates of heaven, Most upset, he questions why, The stars have vanished from the sky, The evil wind has blown them down, And scattered them all over town, - There's one now!" - Vlad, great! "So bright and holy... " Vlad! I said "enough"! ...slowly. Has it snowed?" Why are you upset? You're getting upset over a shitty poem! - What's got into you? - He's gone crazy! - He has? - I'm busy! That shitty poem took ages to learn. - You've gone crazy too? - Meaning? Enough about the shitty fucking poem! Unbelievable! I'm filming with it. Paraschiv's home. What? How could you almost finish the edit? Three idiots saying the same thing? Don't use it if you don't want. Bye. What the fuck are you doing here? Put out the fire and collect this stuff! Who the fuck do you think you are?! - Calm down! - Let go or I'll call the police! Call them. You can explain what you're doing. Call! Is this how you treated him? - Shut the fuck up! - Did you chase him off? - Because he didn't do what you said? - Shut up! Did he get sick of your hysterics? - Yeah, that's why! - Leaving again? Where are you going? - Simona, stop! - Leave me alone! Simona, stop right now! Can't you hear me? Simona! - Simona, let's go home! - Don't tell me what to do! - Who do you think you are? - Simona... - Calm down! - Don't tell me to calm down! - You're not my father! - Calm down! You're not my father! You're not my father! You're not my father! You're not my father! - What? - I'm stuck. I told you, watch the E chord. Put your fingers on the middle and press a little bit harder and it'll work. - I can't do it! - Of course you can. - I can't. - Yes you can. You're being silly. - I don't want to. - Why not? You did the same thing at "Star Melody". - Want my guitar? - Yes! I just tuned it. - It almost plays itself. - I don't believe you! It's the guitar Marley used to play. - I don't believe you! - I swear. - Liar! - Don't be rude! Come on. First chord. One, two, three, and... See? Good morning. I'm here to read the water meter. Will you bring me a chair, please? You need to have a new meter put in. I'll get it dirty. I'll send someone to change it for you. When will you be home? I don't know. After the holidays. OK. Merry Christmas! Your bandage is dirty. You brought your camera? - Yeah, why? - Let's shoot that thing. The interview, or whatever you wanted. No, we won't do it anymore. Please. I want to. Why? Well, it's not like I can tell him these things anymore. At least I can... I know, it's pretty lame. But I want to. - Will you... - What should... My granddad will kill me. No, don't stop. When I was younger, when I was about seven, my dad... Andrei Paraschiv... told me... No, sorry, that's super lame. Let's go again. My dad taught me how to play guitar, ride a bike, fish for gobies. When he played music he used to... I'll start over. When I was ten, he let me drive his car. - Is this ok? - Take two steps back. Perfect, looks good like this. - One minute. - Hey! Mazilu! Thank you. It came out really great. It'll be on air in ten minutes, right after Voicu. I cried, I swear. The girl is really great. - You'll move, right? - Yes. This guy's full of himself! We'll talk on the 5th, when I'm back from vacation. - I'm taking my daughter to Austria. - I don't think I'll be there. - What do you mean? - We'll talk. Ten seconds! I'm coming! Mazilu, call me! Hello, Raluca. Yes, we are here at the Holy Virgin cemetery, where the funeral for our colleague, Andrei Paraschiv, is taking place. Many people have gathered here today... A time comes, you see, when we must turn our hearts to the word of God, the only one who can heal us, help us, even before an open grave. We would like to join in prayer and ask for His blessing, absolution, and healing. Our Father, Who art in heaven We kneel before you, And praise you, for through Jesus Christ you gave us hope... ...after a passenger noticed a suspicious item at one of the boarding gates for a flight to New York. The incident turned out to be a false alarm. The luggage belonged to a passenger who had boarded a different flight... The ELCET explosion claims another victim. One of those badly injured passed away this morning. The patient was a 43-year-old woman, who suffered 60% burns. Hospital sources tell us the remaining patients are in a stable condition. The forecast for the coming days shows that Bucharest will get a white Christmas again this year. It's snowing heavily in the Carpathians and the northern part of the country is already covered in snow. Translation by: Ligia Soare
