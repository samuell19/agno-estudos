(police sirens) (helicopter blades whirring) (tires screech) (siren wailing) - Thank you, boys! Thank you, boys! (laughing) (background chattering) - Folks, the Sister just told me that the sisters have just arrived. They're coming in right through over here. Let's all stand up and give 'em a warm welcome. Come on! (audience applauds) (upbeat music) (audience applauds) (upbeat piano music) - Let's hear it for Brother Michael. (audience applauds) Brother Michael and the Mount Saint Helen's Eruptions. (chuckling) All right. (clicker clicks) (audience laughs) Oh, I found some (laughs). I call this my Catholic finder (chuckles). All right, let there be light. (clicker clicking) - [Man] It won't come on. - What do you mean it won't come on? It was working fine at play practice. - [Man] Yeah, well, it's not working now. I don't know what's wrong. I'll fix it in a minute. - (grunts) Would you excuse me, please? In a minute Reverend Mother, next week, next month, never now, never when I need it. (light clicks) (audience laughs) I tell ya, never ask a man to do a nun's job. (audience laughs) (audience applauds) (chuckles) Well, let's begin all over again. Now, good evening friends. - [Audience] Good evening, Sister. - Oh my goodness, now I haven't seen you in over 20 years. (audience laughs) You know, the mass is in English now (laughs). (audience laughs) Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Mount St. Helen's School. Now, before we begin, in case there's anyone here who's visiting us for the first time, I want to introduce the sisters to you. First we have our novice, our newest member, Sister Mary Leo. (audience applauding) Sister Leo came to us direct from the Lulu B. Tuggins School of Ballet, Baton, and Hula in Elgin, Illinois. (audience laughs) She hopes to dedicate her life to God by becoming the first nun ballerina. Isn't that so, Sister? - Yes, Reverend Mother. - Yes, well that's enough dear. Don't give it away. (audience laughs) And next we have Sister Mary Paul. Mary Paul. Amnesia, come over here. (audience laughs) (audience applauds) Some of you may remember that Sister got hit on the head with a Crucifix, and for the longest time, couldn't remember who she was. Well, even though she did finally remember, I guess we'll always think of her as Sister Amnesia. (laughs) She's come a long way on the road to recovery. (audience laughs) Not a very long way, but a long way (laughs). (audience laughs) Next-- - Rev, me. - I know, I'm getting to you Robert Anne. This is Sister Robert Anne, our convent driver. (audience applauds) - Woo, woo, woo! - She also teaches gym. (whistle blows) (audience laughs) And works with our troubled youth. Which is only fitting since she had quite a troubled... Oh well, I guess some things are best left unsaid. No, Robert Anne's a good egg, if a bit hard boiled at times. (audience laughs) In fact, you know, you might say she's an entire breakfast, because she's also quite a ham (chuckles). (audience laughs) She does fancy herself (laughs) quite the performer. - Oh (humming)! (audience laughs) - (laughs) Get out of here. (audience applauds) (audience whooping) Don't encourage her. (audience laughs) And of course I could not get a long without my second in command, Sister Mary Hubert. (audience applauding) (audience whooping) Sister Hubert is our Mistress of Novices, so just being a heartbeat away from being Mother Superior. - Ba-da-boom, ba-da-boom, ba-da-boom, beep (chuckles). (audience laughs) Ba-da-boom. (audience laughs) - Sister Hubert is number two around here. Aren't you dear? - Just call me Tonto. (audience laughs) - And as you'd probably already guessed, I am Sister Mary Regina, the Mother Superior of the Little Sisters of Hope. (audience applauds) Well. - Hi ho, Silver. - Away! (audience laughs) - (chuckles) Yes. Well, now that you know who we are, I want each one of you to stand up and introduce yourself (laughs). (audience laughs) Kidding, just kidding (chuckles). But before we begin the show, I do want to take a few minutes to tell you about the stage setting. Now, next week Mount Saint Helen's has the honor of hosting the Interfaith Musical Society of Hoboken's Annual Show. And this year, thanks to a very generous contribution from Ishizowa Subaru and Sushi bar, (audience laughs) oh, you've been there, (audience laughs) They are doing that ever popular Japanese hit, The Mikado, so. (audience laughs) Oh, you've seen it! (audience laughs) Oh well, come and see it again. And then do stop by Ishizowa's and try their bar and by a car (chuckles). (audience laughs) I made that up myself (chuckles). (audience laughs) But, enough about their show. Tonight, our show is dedicated to all of you for all the support you have given us in the past. So, as we begin our program, let us raise our voices and thank the Lord for this opportunity to thank you. Brother Michael, if you will.

They all seem to have been bitten by the theater flea. - Reverend Mother, that's bitten by the showbiz bug. - What? - The expression, it's bitten by the showbiz bug, you said flea. - (chuckles) Oh, dopey me. I thought it was flea (laughs). Well, the point is, they've been looking for any excuse to get back on the stage, so you can just imagine how thrilled they were when I suggested we do this little thank you program. - Reverend Mother, correct me if I'm wrong, but I distinctly remember it was I who suggested the thank you program. - Oh, no, it was I, Hubert. We were watching General Hospital, and that Erica Kane was havin' that fight. - Oh, wait a minute, no, no, no, Erica Kane is with All My Children, and that's the show I watch. - Oh, that was All My Child-- - And that daughter of hers - Oh, well, anyway, I don't know maybe it was you. Anyway it doesn't matter who thought of it, does it? The point is, we're here. And we've been a little bit concerned that those of you who weren't able to attend our first show, might not understand what this one's all about. - That's why I suggested that we prepare a little explanation for everyone, and that's what we're gonna do right now. - Well, thank you, Hubert. - Don't mention it. (audience laughs) - You know, the show really was my idea. (audience laughs) But if it makes her feel better to think she thought of it, then I'll just keep my mouth shut. Being number one around here, it kinda goes with the territory. Hubert is just the slightest bit jealous of me, and I don't wanna rattle her cage. Talk about the fur flying, whew (laughs)! My goodness, Hubert, I was just telling everybody how clever you are (laughs). - Ready, girls? Six weeks ago, our cook, Sister Julia, Child of God, made some Vichyssoise soup and 52 of our Sisters died instantly of botulism. Reverend Mother prayed for guidance and had a vision of either Saint Catherine of Siena or Saint Thomas Aquinas in drag, she still hasn't figured out which. Anyway, she was told to make greeting cards to raise money for the burials, which she did, but then she spent part of the money on a VCR for the convent, so we had to put on a show to raise money for the rest of the burials. Now, the eighth graders were using the stage at the time for their musical production of Grease, which Reverend Mother thought was Vaseline, but we couldn't wait, because we had to put the last four dead Sisters in the convent freezer, and if the Health Inspector came snooping around, it would've been curtains for all of us. Well just before the end of the show, Sister Amnesia, who Reverend Mother had hoped would turn out to be a Franciscan, remembered that she was on her way to Nashville to become a country singer, when she felt this calling. She decided not to become a big star and become unimportant like all of us. She said her name was Sister Mary Paul. Suddenly Reverend Mother remembered that Mary Paul was the name of the nun who won the Publishers Clearing House Sweepstakes, and no one could find her. Sister Amnesia had saved the day, we were rich. And that's all there is to it.

Oh, or perhaps you prefer to remain anonymous. Oh, yes. Oh, yes, well, as we used to say when I was a star in the circus (laughs), "On with the show!" - Isn't this great? - Oh, yeah, hey, Star Search, here we come! - Hubert, don't you just love bein' onstage? - Oh you know, I was onstage before I became a nun (laughs). - Now you never told me that. - Oh, yes. I even played Hamlet (laughs). - I could see you as a Great Dane. Hmm. (audience laughs) - Reverend Mother, will you hold this? - Mm-hmm (affirmative). - Thank you. - What you doing? - Breaking an egg. - Why? - It's good luck. (audience laughs) - Amnesia, it's break a leg. You break a leg for good luck. - Oh, for heaven's sake. (audience laughs) - Dopey me. You break a leg so you can get in the cast. (audience laughs) (scattered applause) - Why couldn't she have been a Franciscan? (audience laughs) - Okay, sit up straight, eyes forward, pay attention. I got a question I wanna ask all o' ya here tonight, okay. What is the next best thing to heaven? - [Man In Crowd] Sex! (audience laughs) - (laughs) I wouldn't know. (audience laughs) What is the second best next thing to heaven? - [Audience Members] Chocolate! - Close, but it's not. It's Bingo! (audience applauds) And we're gonna play Bingo right here, right now (laughs). Surprise. (audience laughs) Yeah, everybody take a look in your programs, 'cause I put a Bingo card in every single one of your programs. Okay, now listen, I gotta find something out here. How many here have played Bingo before? (audience murmurs) Oh, good. How many here have played Catholic Bingo before? (audience laughs) That's it, huh? Well now listen, tonight we're not gonna play Four Corners, Little Joe, Love Letters, or anything like that. No, no, no, tonight, we're gonna play regular old-fashioned quickie Bingo. Now that means, the first person who gets five up, five down, five across, or five on a slant, you win the prize (laughs). (scattered laughs) Now listen, I know, well you probably didn't bring your Lucky Dab Bingo markers or anything like that with you, huh? So what you're gonna have to do is you're, sir, can I borrow your card? Oh, thank you (laughs). Oh, hello Sister (laughs). Have you played Bingo before? (laughs) I thought so. Now listen, what you're gonna hafta do is, you're gonna hafta mark these numbers with a pen, or a pencil, or lipstick, or you could just put your fingers on the numbers as you get 'em, okay. (audience laughs) And you see this free number in the middle where it says free? That's a free spot for everybody, including the Protestants. (audience laughs) There you go. Are you Catholic, sir? - No. (audience laughs) - You're not (laughs)? - (laughs) No. - Sister, would you like another card? (audience laughs) I gotta better, give it back. Did you touch it? Yeah. Here you go, you can have it back. - Does that mean I'm Catholic now? - No, it means it's twice-blessed (laughs). (audience laughs) And you'll need it, okay. (audience laughs) Now listen, the most important thing to remember is that as soon as someone gets all five numbers, five up, five down, five across, or five on a slant, you gotta shout, "Bingo!" Why don't we all practice that all together. Okay, ready? One, two, three! - [Audience] Bingo! - Oh, good. (audience laughs) Oh, one more thing though, as soon as someone gets all five numbers, you also have to stand up, so that way I know where you are, so I know where to find you to give you the prize. And wait til you see this prize, it's beautiful. I made it myself (laughs). (audience laughs) okay now, I am so excited because this is the first time I am calling a Bingo game all by myself (laughs). And I've been practicing real hard. Now up here, this is the Bingo cage. And in the Bingo cage are the Bingo balls. Now every single ball has a number on it. So now, you gotta mark your cards every time I hold one o' your balls, okay. (audience laughs) (laughs) Are ya ready! - [Audience] Yes! - Are ya ready? - [Audience] Yes! - Here we go. Round and round and round she goes, and where she stops, nobody knows. Oh, what a way to start the game, by taking the best vitamin in the whole wide world. It's B-12. B-12, everybody, B-12. B-12. Mark those cards everybody, it's B-12. And the next number outta the Bingo cage, here we go, and it's (gasps), it's I-22, the ballerina ball, I-22, I-2-2, the ballerina ball, I-2-2. (laughs) Mark your cards now. No talking, everybody. Keep your eyes on your own card. Okay, here we go. And it's B-15. B-15, B-15, B-1-5, B-1-5, B-Uno-Cinque, Uno-Cinque, that's Italian (laughs), yeah. I been taking Italian lessons from Sister Robert Anne. It's like, "Hey, paisan, come stai?" okay. Oh, G-49, G-49, everybody, G-49. G-4-9, G-4-9, mark those cards, everybody. And the next number outta the Bingo cage, here we go, and it's (gasps), oh, it's the Dolly Parton number, it's N-44, N-44, Dolly Parton, Dolly Parton, I just love this game. Okay, come on home, little doggy. Mama needs a new pair of shoes. Let's see it. (gasps) O-13, bad luck. Keep movin' right along.

And the next number outta the Bingo cage is, here we go, (gasps) it's G-57, G-57. - [Audience] Bingo! - Aah! (audience laughs) (audience applauds) - She blew it, didn't she (laughs)? Moving right along, pacing, pacing. Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure in presenting Sister Mary Leo in an original ballet, The Stoning of Mary Magdalene. (uptempo music) Hey, hey, hey, hey! Whew! Hey! I'm not Mary Magdelene. (audience laughs) - Lord, no, I'm not doing the ballet tonight, I'm doing something different. - Oh, well you ready? - [Mary Leo] Yeah. - Good. - [Mary Leo] Oh, Sister Hubert? - Yes, dear? - [Mary Leo] Can you get the rocks off?

It just seems like good fortune has touched us all. Well, all except our cook, Sister Julia, Child of God. (audience laughs) I don't know if there's any hope for her, although last week, she did give us a pretty good laugh. This crotchety old priest from the Office of Religious stopped by. And I must say, he was being awfully rude to all the Sisters. He even managed, somehow, to get himself invited to lunch. Well, when Julia was serving him, he took one look at his plate and he said, "This isn't fit for a pig." So Julia picked his plate up and said, "Well wait, I'll get you something that is." (audience laughs) (laughs) Remember? Oh, it was rich (laughs). But I'm gettin' off the track here. I was telling you about our good fortune. Now when we realized that Sister Amnesia had been a country singer, we felt she shouldn't ignore this wonderful gift. And so now, she has some very exciting news for you. Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to present, our newest country-singing sensation, Sister Mary Paul!

May I remind you, you're the one that got her that puppet in the first place? - That's only because the doctor suggested it as a way to help her regain her memory. Nobody told me she was gonna turn into Sister Sybil. Oh! (audience laughs) - Am I gonna get it? - Not in a million years. (audience laughs) (phone ringing) - I'll get it! - I will, I'll get it! - I'll get it! - I'll get it! - Oh, now what? - Mount Saint Helen's? - If that's the Health Inspector, tell him I left the country. - Oh, Reverend Mother, I already told him that four times today. And four times yesterday. Four times the day before that. Four times the day before-- - [Reverend Mother] Amnesia! - But why won't anybody talk to him? - Wait a minute, I can't understand you. - Who is it? - It's Sister Maria Chiquita Rosita Bonita de Guadalupe. She's calling from the convent. I said wait a minute! I can't understand you! - Leo, she's Spanish, not deaf. (audience laughs) - Here, let me talk to her. Yo, Lupe! (audience laughs) (speaking gibberish) - How does she do that? - [Reverend Mother] What? - (speaking gibberish) Oh, (laughs) that's not so hard. Why did you think it would be the Health Inspector, our freezer's clean? - Because ever since Reverend Mother expelled his son Vinny, he's been out to get us. - (gasps) You expelled Vinny Prestapinni? - Well, I had no choice after what that little hooligan did. They say poor Sister Fermina will be on lithium the rest of her life. (audience laughs) - Rev! Rev, you're not gonna believe this. You know how you're always sayin' that God answers your prayers? - Don't tell me we won the red Ferrari? - No, not exactly, no. Look, you know how you're always sayin' that you hope when Amnesia remembers who she is, she turns out to be a Franciscan? - Yes. - Well the Lord musta heard ya 'cause Lupe said that the Franciscans just showed up at the convent. There's a tall one named Sister Brunhilde, and a fat one named Sister Fritz, and they say that Sister Mary Paul is theirs. - What? - I'm a Franciscan? - That's what they say. - No! I don't wanna be a Franciscan! - Regina, there must be a mistake. - I'm sure there is. - No, no, I'm gonna hide, they're never gonna find me! (nuns overlapping) - You know, Rev, somebody better talk to them. I mean, what if they really did try to take her? Nothing would be the same around here (scoffs). - Boy, you can say that again. (scattered laughing) Hey, maybe they'd like you, too. You know, we're supposed to travel in pairs. (audience laughs) Just when you think it's safe to go back to the convent, the Franciscans show up. - Oh, you know what I always say, you can't trust people that spend that much time with animals. (audience laughs) - Robert Anne! Why don't you go over there and find out what this is all about. Explain to them that Sister Amnesia's about one sandwich shy of a picnic. (audience laughs) I'll hold down the fort here. I wouldn't be in this mess if I'd just stuck with the circus. Oh, those were the days (chuckles). The whole family up there on that highwire, the crowds cheerin'. I'll never forget the night I made my first solo appearance. Altoona, PA, the fourth of July, I was dressed as the Statue of Liberty, carrying this big flamin' torch. See, I was supposed to go across the wire solo and get my brother, he was the token immigrant, (audience laughs) shepherd him back across the wire to the land of the free. Well, everything was going just fine, until my torch accidentally singed the seat of his pants. (audience laughs) He suddenly just shot right off that wire! Goodness gracious, great balls o' fire, he lit up like (audience laughs) Saint Blaise (laughs). (audience laughs) well, how was I to know he'd stuck some Roman candles in his hip pocket? (audience laughs) There I was on that highwire with rockets and fireworks flyin' all around me. When my brother hit the safety net, he yelled back up at me that I had pushed him. Well I yelled right back, "Liar, liar, pants on fire, you fell off the tightrope wire." (audience laughs) Course, with all the commotion goin' on, everybody expected me to come down, too, but I held on (laughs). And when I got back to that platform (gasps), that crowd went wild. Whew! I looked down, I could see my mother lookin' up at me. There were tears on her face, but she was smilin'.

They said the church was locked. - Oh, I haven't seen these old Fiddlebacks in years. You know, it's a shame women can't become priests, I look so festive in red (laughs). (audience laughs) - Let me see one. (gasps) Ooh, lilac. - [Hubert] What do ya' think? - Ooh, that's snappy. How would I look? - Go right ahead. You know, it isn't fair. Why can't we be priests? - Well, the Pope said so. - Is he a chauvinist? - No, he's Polish. (audience laughs) - Well, Episcopal women can be priests.

You're worse than third-graders. - Is this cool or what? - Will you tell me what happened with the Franciscans? - Oh, yeah, yeah. Look, it's a little more serious than we thought, but I think I convinced 'em to leave Amnesia with us. - Oh well, praise the Lord. - But, they want the prize money. - What? - what are you talking about? - Well, yeah, they said that since Sister Mary Paul is a Franciscan, the prize money is theirs. - Isn't that great. They don't want me. - Yeah, that's great. They don't want you. (audience laughs) They just want the mon-- - Oh goodness, she's gonna faint! Someone get some water quickly!

Hubert, what happened? - You fainted, dear. Have a little more. That's good. - What is that? - What do you mean what is it? It's water. - Taste it. It tastes awful. - Mm.

And then, we'll get right back to the program. - Wait a minute, I got an idea! - Oh, wait a minute, she's got an idea. - What if we... That's funny, it went right outta my head. - [Reverend Mother] Hmm. (audience laughs) - You know, I'm startin' to feel a little dizzy, how 'bout you? - Hmm, I feel divine. - Are you sure? - Am I sure? Is the bear Catholic? Does the Pope poop in the woods? (audience laughs) (Reverend Mother laughing) Oh, my goodness. I better have some more of this. - Oh, oh, wait a minute, wait a minute. I remember my idea. We can sell our story to the movies, show 'em what a real Sister act's all about, we'll be rich. - Hubert, that is a sennation, sensanisial, it's a fabulous idea. (audience laughs) You know, that is such a good idea, maybe you should be Mother Superior. - You know what? Maybe I should (laughs). - But you're not, Hubert, your not. I am (laughs). Oh, I can see it now. There I am up on the screen, and Louis B. Mayer is in the audience. - Louis B. Mayer, he's dead. - Is he still dead? - Mm. (audience laughs) - Aww.

Yeah. (audience applauds) They want ya to do it, too. - Oh, all right, I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it. - Okay come on, Amnesia. They're probably ready for a refill. - Okay. Oh, Robert Anne, break your legs. (audience laughs) - Okay, well, all right. Of course, I was not planning on doing this here, so I'll need a second to think a little bit here. Let me see what we can come up with (laughs). Oh, I know, all right. Let's start out with a little comment on the economic situation, okay. This is Sister Merrill Lynch. (audience laughs) (audience applauds) (laughs) Oh, Let's think here. Let me think. Oh, all right, here we go. All right, ready? Eh, what's up, Your Holiness? (audience laughs) Bugs Nunny. (audience laughs) (laughs) Oh, this is a good one for the kids here. Teenage Mutant Nunja Turtles, cowabunga, dude. (audience laughs) (audience applauds) You know, this year, I got assigned to the high school Opportunity Room at Mount Saint Helen's. You know what that is? That's where you get sent when no other Sister can handle you (laughs). Yeah, believe me, humor is the only way we survive in there, right. Well, that plus an occasional karate chop. Hai! (audience laughs) Okay, here we go. This is one of my fractured fairy tales. All right, here we go. La-la-la-la-la-la-- Say what? You wanna climb up my-- Ooh, I don't think so (laughs). (audience laughs) Sister Rapunzel says, "Get a ladder." (audience laughs) (audience applauds) Okay, oh all right. This is my MTV veil, okay. You'll like this. This is Michael Jackson before and after. (audience laughs) (audience applauds) (laughs) Well, like I said, humor's the only way we get by around here sometimes. Really though, I mean, there are days if you can't laugh, you'd... Take last week for instance. I get this letter in the mail. No return address, just a little number up in the corner. So I know right away, it's from prison. Hmm. Yeah, it says, "Dear Sister Bob," some of the guys like to call me Sister Bob. "Dear Sister Bob, I hope that you are fine. Things have not been goin' so good for me since I left Mount Saint Helen's. As a matter of fact, it's been mostly downhill. I recently got busted in Jersey City, and I'm currently doing three to five for auto theft. But things are not all bad," except for this. "Things are not all bad. My good buddy Vinny Prestapinni just got sent down here, and we have already met six other guys from Mount Saint Helen's." (audience laughs) See, you gotta laugh, right? Okay, this is my final impression here. From the stage and the silver screen, Nunset Boulevard. (sweeping orchestral music) I'm ready for my closeup Sister DeMille. (audience applauds) You know actually, I have a little confession to make here, I did not invent the habit humor. No, no. I learned it from my good friend Annie, Annie Green. We grew up together in Brooklyn. You think I'm tough? She used to open Coke bottles with her teeth (laughs). Yeah. Anyway she became a Sister of Saint Joseph, you know. And she used to do tricks with her veils, well, hmm, I wouldn't even attempt 'em, no way. You know, when Saint Joe's modernized their habits, it kinda blew her whole act. (audience laughs) Hey, those girls there now, they get so duded up, you don't if you're talkin' to a nun or the Avon lady. (audience laughs) Really (laughs). Anyway, knowin' Annie the way that I did, I figured that she would be glad to get back into her Calvin's and her cowboy boots, you know. I never thought that she would take things so hard. She got kind of attached to the old gear, I guess. Felt kind of insecure without it. I can relate. Sort of like Linus and his security blanket.

They're backstage. - [Robert Anne] What? - [Amnesia] They're gonna take me. They're gonna take me. I know it. They're gonna take me. - No, no, no, no, no, they're not gonna take you, no. (laughs) We made a deal, remember? - No. I was hiding backstage behind my bush. I heard them say, "No deals." - Well, we'll just see about that, now. - And you know that 36-inch screen you got for the VCR? - What about it? - Yeah, well Sister Brunhilde put it in their station wagon. She said, "Zey bought zis mit the prize money, und it's ours." (audience laughs) - She took my screen? - [Amnesia] Yeah. - Oh, let me at her! - Maybe I shouldn'ta told her about the screen. "Zey bought zis mit the prize money, und it's ours." (ominous music) You know, there's something real familiar about that voice. Oh no, maybe I really am a Franciscan. (crashing) (nuns shouting) - You won't believe it. Robert Anne just decked one of the Franciscans. - You know, they're the kind of nuns that give nuns a bad name. - Robert Anne, I agree that they need to be taught some manners, but laying out Sister Brunhilde's not going to solve anything. - Are they still here? - No, no, they've gone to get some ice packs, but they'll be back. Hubert, what am I gonna do? - Well, maybe now is a good time to tell Reverend Mother about Robert's idea. - What idea? - Well, we realized there are only two things in life you can count on, and that is death and taxes. - We don't pay taxes. - So what's left? - Death! - And who knows more about dead people than us? - Yeah! I mean, what could be more logical? We can make back the money by offering our services to the dead. - Robert Anne, this is no time for one of year half-baked ideas. Don't you realize our little Carnival Cruise ship is turning into the Titanic? - The Titanic! That's full of dead people! We could make a killing. (audience laughs) - Reverend Mother, I think Robert's got a point. - She's got a point all right, but her veil covers it up. (audience laughs) - Robert Anne. Now Regina, hear us out, you may change your mind. Now go over there and lie down. - Lie down? - Yeah. Just lie down and pretend you're dead. - What? What are we doing? - Quiet, you're dead.

I can take anything but another surprise. - Oh, but you're gonna love this. - Reverend Mother, we know that you've been having a very difficult time. And I thought, if we could cheer you up, it might help you figure out what to do. - Well, that's awfully sweet of you, Sister Leo, but I don't think being cheerful will help right now. - Well, it couldn't hurt.

(audience laughs) - You know, as I recall, when they rolled back that rock, the cupboard was bare (laughs), but it's not gonna be for long. - What do you mean? - Here, come here and help me with this, Hubert. - What are you up to now? - Amnesia! - [Amnesia] What? - Would you bring me that book now, dear? I've got an idea. - Remember what happened with that last book. - Oh, yeah, she got fined for selling poison recipes. - That, she remembers. (audience laughs) Well, this is different. I've checked this one out myself. Now you know, when I was in the circus, I used to watch the barkers. And do you wanna know the one lesson I learned from them? - There's a sucker born every minute (laughs)? - We've been here over an hour, so we have at least 60. (audience laughs) - Now stop that, both of you. No. The one lesson I learned from the barkers was, if you've got something to sell, people will buy. And ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, I've got something to sell! And here it is! You say it looks like an ordinary book. Well, you're half-right, it 'tis a book, but it's hardly ordinary. It is extraordinary. This is the greatest little book in all the world. You got this little book, you don't need any other book. "What is it," you say? Well I'm about to tell ya, keep your pants on. Boys and girls, ladies and gentlemen, I am talkin' about the one, the only "Catholic Guide to Gift Giving!" (audience laughs) - The what? - "Catholic Guide to Gift Giving," did I stutter? How many times have you found yourself runnin' around in circles tryin' to find that one special gift for that one special person? Well, run no more. This little book is gonna solve all your problems. - Well, what if you're not Catholic? - Aw, Sister Hubert, Reverend Mother's Catholic. (audience laughs) - But, even if I weren't, it wouldn't be a problem. - You could be a Reverend Mother and not be Catholic? (audience laughs) - Why don't you just look at the pretty pictures, little lady. (audience laughs) - I was about to say that this book has a special section for our non-Catholic friend. It's over here in the back somewhere. Now I know you're just dying to find out about what we have to offer, so why don't we jump right in. - Why stop now (laughs)? - All right. First of all, I know you're gonna want to order our convent classic. From our kitchen to yours, you asked for it, and you got it, it's the Create Your Own Pasta Madonna kit! (audience laughs) (audience applauds) Have you ever seen anything so unusual? - She's so, um, um, al dente. - Mm. Hand crafted from over 40 different kinds of noodles. - Yeah, with some assembly required (laughs) (audience laughs) - Thank you, dear. Now when you wanna show someone you care, here is just a lovely gift. Look at this. It's an autographed picture of Saint Anthony. It's an eight by 10 glossy. And it's signed, "I found a friend. Love, Tony of Padua." These are relics, friends. (audience laughs) Only 50 of these left, so hurry, hurry, hurry. - Oh what's this? Are your children possessed by the devil? (laughs) The answer to all your problems is our new Home-Exorcism Video (laughs). Oh, it comes complete with holy water, two cans of pea soup, and 14 famous quotes from the devil including, "Your mother eats--" - Hubert! - What? What? (audience laughs) - We get the idea. - (gasps) Oh, look at all the cute little Easter bunnies. - Well, what could be more fun for Easter than your very own Last Supper in solid chocolate? (audience laughs) - Oh yeah, and it says the apostles can be separated so you can eat one apostle at a time or all 12 at once (laughs). (audience laughs) - I just like to bite their little heads off. (audience laughs) - Folks, don't miss your chance to get a-head for the holidays with your very own John the Baptist party platter (laughs). (audience laughs) It includes seven decorative veils, and 14 pounds of Salome (laughs). - Isn't that salami? - Work with me on this, Hubert, work with me. (audience laughs) - Look at this man floating in the air. - Well now, you just have to see this to believe it. It's your own Ascension Thursday Levitation Kit. (audience laughs) Amaze your friends, rise up to 20 feet with no wires. (audience laughs) Comes with 200 AA batteries. Whew (laughs)! (audience laughs) - Oh, I want this, Bernadette of Lourdes Bubble Bath! - Oh yes, and for those who want to pray in the shower, we have Pope on a Rope (laughs). (audience laughs) (Reverend Mother laughing) (audience applauds) - Now Hubert, - Hmm? - have you ever seen a fat saint? Never! So look at this, finally the secret is revealed. Our Lady of Fatima Diet Drinks. The next time you make an appearance, your friends will say, "It's a miracle," (laughs). (audience laughs) - You know Reverend Mother, I got something that I think, well, maybe you could sell in this catalog. - Oh you do? - Yeah. - Dare I ask? - Yeah, go for it. - What is it, dear? - It's beautiful, Reverend Mother. I made it myself. It was the prize for the Bingo game, yeah, but something went wrong. (audience laughs) It's really beautiful, Reverend Mother. It's a painting. It's a painting on velvet. (audience laughs) I call it The Knights of Columbus Discovering America. Ta-da! (audience laughs) - Well Amnesia, where are the people? Where are the boats? - It's night! (audience laughs) - She did it to me again. - [Leo] The Franciscans are back! The Franciscans are back! - The Franciscans, uh-oh! - I'm right behind you, Hubert. - Nothing's been decided yet, hey! Reverend Mother, hey! Oh, hey! Hey. (audience laughs) Brother Michael, it's showtime (laughs).

But I couldn't remember where. And then it hit me, well the house hit me. And then I realized, I realized that it was the voice on the telephone. It was Mr. Prestapinni! - That Health Inspector? - Yes, Sister Brunhilde is Mr. Prestapinni, the Health Inspector. - No, I don't believe that. Are you sure? - Hey, go look for yourself. Who could make up a story like this? - I knew I wasn't a Franciscan, I look terrible in brown. (audience laughs) - But why? - Because brown is an earth tone, I look better in cool colors. (audience laughs) (audience applauds) - No, why did Mr. Prestapinni do this? - It was revenge, revenge for expelling his son Vinny. You know he wanted to get us legally with the four Sisters in the freezer, but the prize money took care of that (laughs). - His partner was at the benefit, and he heard you say that Amnesia might be a Franciscan, so they cooked up this plan. - Oh, they did? - Oh, there is one bit of bad news, though. There never was a talent scout. Prestapinni just sent you that telegram to divert your attention. - No talent scout. - Hoboken, here we stay. - But you still have me. (audience laughs) - Yes, we still have you, and if we still have you, we still have the prize money. We're rich. Again!
