You were just having a bad dream, that's all, baby. That's all it was. Bad dreams make you think you've seen things that you haven't. You know what I do when I have a bad dream? I close my eyes and I think of something nice. Like being here with you. Hurry up, sweetheart. I can't be late. Shit! Jack? - Did you see someone ring my bell? - No. OK, thanks. I cleaned everything away, sweetheart! Everything's exactly how it was before. - No! No! - The floors are clean and shiny. Look. You see? OK, alright, just close your eyes. - Well, hello, sailor! - Hi! Permission to come aboard? Honey, hold this. Sorry we couldn't make it yesterday. Somebody was working late again! How you doing, Sal? - I'm good. How are you? - I'm alright. Look at you. - You like it? - You look great. Really? It's nothing. I just threw it on. Bullshit. She's had outfits laid out for a week. You're such a liar! Ignore my husband, please. I don't listen to a word he says. I brought really good friend, Heather. Promise me you'll be attentive. - How you doing, man? - I asked you not to bring anyone. You don't like her? Believe me, she's the best-looking of Sally's friends. Which, granted, isn't saying much. I asked you not to. You live on a boat with an 18-year-old boy and you ask me not to bring girls? Greg, this is Heather. She's a very good friend of mine and, er, I thought you guys should meet. - Hi. - Hi. Can you just excuse me for a moment? - Jess. Are you OK? - I don't think so. Hey. What happened? Hey! What's the matter? - I'm sorry. - You got nothing to apologise for. What is it? Are you OK? I'm just tired. We don't have to go today if you don't want to. No, I do. I-I wanna go. Are you sure? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah? OK, come on, come meet the gang. - Sally, and her husband, Downey. - Hi. This is Heather. You remember Victor. So let's go sailing! OK! Hey. You OK? Is Greg OK? He's fine. He's upstairs. You've been asleep for a couple of hours. I had this terrible dream. - What about? - I don't remember. I wouldn't worry. Apparently, bad dreams cure you of real-life stress. As indeed does champagne! You want some? Yeah. Downey, wanna give me a hand, please? Actually, Victor, I'm a guest of the captain's, but, yes, I will help you. Victor, what was that back there at the harbour? What? I asked Jess if she was alright, and you said no. You told me she was bringing a little boy along. When I was walking with her, I asked her where he was and... Well, she couldn't remember. She stared into space for 20 seconds, and then she said he's at school. So? Well, it's Saturday. There ain't no school today. Her son goes to a special needs school and it's open every day. Be nice to her. - Alright. - Alright. So, do you boys sunbathe together? Sometimes. The champagne's not great, but it is cold. - Want some? - No, thanks. OK, more for me. Hey. How you feeling? Sorry. I didn't realise how tired I was. You apologise one more time and I'm gonna throw you overboard. Here. - You alright? - Yeah. It thinks we're a fishing boat. He's gonna go hungry. - You wanna steer? - No. - Go on. - Oh... Oop! Which way do I aim? You wanna aim that way. It's easy, right? She's a waitress at some diner. He eats there, they talked, they became friends. Oh, and she has an autistic son. - So, they're just friends? - Sally! Do you want me to say I'm sorry she has a retarded son? - Yeah! - Well, I'm sorry. But you know, that's not Greg's problem, that's hers. - What is it? Is it the shorts? - No! Heather, Greg's been my friend for a really long time. I can't sit back and watch him get shaken down. She isn't doing that. Well, I hope not, because Greg is far too trusting. I'm kinda liking the boy! No, you're not. Can you please go up there and talk to Greg? I really think the two of you would be perfect for each other. And I really don't like seeing him with her. Jess, you ready? Yeah, let her go! Yeah! Whoo! How do you know everyone? Victor's staying with me for a bit. He got into some trouble at home. I found him sleeping behind the store at the harbour. We got talking... - And now he lives here. - Just like that? - You let him move in? - I got three rooms. I can't sleep in them all. And Downey, I've known him since I was a kid. And Sally, his wife, I know her from high school. I dated her for four days in the eighth grade, so, technically, she's my ex. - They seem really nice. - Yeah. Except for the fact that every year, they feel obliged to bring me an eligible girl. Maybe they think you're lonely. - Do I give off lonely to you? - Sometimes. When I come in to see you at the diner, I'm not lonely, I'm hungry. Obviously yesterday was different. - What happened yesterday? - Well, yesterday, I was not hungry. I came in with the sole purpose of inviting you sailing. You did? I did. Hey, turn her portside. We're losing wind. Here, let me take it for just a sec. So, are things OK with Tommy? The same. Every day's the same. Tommy likes things to be a certain way. If I do one thing differently, I lose him. What's the matter? I've never seen you like this before. I don't know. I just, er, feel guilty when I'm not with Tommy. That's because you're a good mother. But you can't be everywhere all of the time. It's... Hey, guys. Oh! - How's it going? - We're good. I was just wondering if I could steal Jess away from you. Sally's dying to talk to her. We're kind of in the middle of something. No, no, no. It's OK. I should circulate. Hey, just for the record... I'm not interested. Yo, what the fuck...? Wind's dropped out on us. It's not dropped. It's gone. This is crazy. You ever seen this before? Yeah. Yeah, just not quite so sudden. Are we OK to get home if there's no wind? Yeah, yeah. We got an engine. It's not a problem. It's just, it's weird. Greg? Is that normal? OK, I'm fucking freaked now. What the fuck? Triangle to coastguard. Over. Triangle to coastguard. Over. Coastguard. Go ahead. Over. We've just gone from seven knots to absolute zero. You got anything unusual? Over. Nothing showing up. Over. It's darkening pretty quick. Looks like an electrical storm. Over. - Help me. Please, can you hear me? Help me! Please, help me! Killing everyone! They're dead! They're all dead! We hear you. What's your position? Over. Hurry! Hurry! Distress caller, we hear you. What are your coordinates? Over. Coastguard, did you hear a distress call? Over. Distress caller, make another transmission. What is your position? Greg! Get below deck now! Get the life jackets! Cut it! Cut the sail! Vic! Get the mainsail down! Get it down! Heather! Vic! - Get back! - Greg! Jess, take my hand! Grab on! Heather! Grab on! Heather! Vic! Jess! Jess, are you OK? Are you alright? Downey? - You guys OK? - Have you seen Heather? - She got washed out the window. - No. Come on! Come on! - Sally! - Heather! Climb on board. Do what Greg says. Heather? Greg, help me! Help me! Can you see her? - Just give me your hand. - Heather! - Are you guys OK? - Yeah. Are you alright? Tommy's at school, yeah? He'll be looked after until we get back. He'll be alright. Thank God! Yo! Help us! Help us! Please! - Over here! - Help us! Please! Oh! Oh, God! - Hey! - Here! - Please! - Hey, come on! Over here! Hey, there, over there, I can see someone. Yo! We need some help down here! - Hey! - Help us, please! Hello! We need some help down here. - Yeah, he's seen us. - Help! Oh, thank God. Jump, jump, jump. OK. Jess, come on, come on. Jess, come on. Come on. Take my hand. OK, good. OK? You made it. You OK? You OK? - We're OK. - I know. Hey! See? I told you. OK? Hello? Hello? Hello? Do we wait? Let's go to the bridge. We'll get the captain to call the coastguard. - We'll get a search on for Heather. - Yeah, OK. Come on. Do you think Heather made it on board? - Honey... - There's a chance. Yeah. Yeah, there's a chance. Hello? Hello? Hello? Can somebody please help us? Hello? Where the fuck is everybody? Do you know where we're going? Uh-huh. Or are we just... just walking for the sake of it? Are you alright? I feel like I know this place. I recognise this corridor. Liners, they look... pretty similar. No, that's not it. Come check this out. If this is the same ship, then this thing's old. Jess. Come on. - Yeah. - Come on. 1932. It is the same, see? - Here's where we boarded. - Oh, yeah. - The Ay-oh-lus. - Aeolus. "Aeolus was the Greek God of the winds and the father of Sisyphus, a man condemned by the gods to the task of pushing a rock up a mountain only to see it roll down again." - Shitty punishment. What'd he do? - He cheated death. No, he made a promise to death that he didn't keep. I've studied it but I can't remember. Can we just keep on moving, please? Hello? Whoever it was might want these. Let me see. These are mine. - These are my keys. - What are you talking about? - They're mine. - Bullshit! This... This is my house key. This is my car key. This is my son. See? Wait. You had them with you on the yacht? Yes. It's gotta be Heather. - Come on! - How else did they get here? Heather dropped her keys but didn't bother to say, "I didn't drown"? Well, why not? Come on. Heather? Looks like you got your welcome party. Just not the welcome. Heather? Oh, Greg, what time you got? About 11:30. Heather? Heather? Where is everyone? - Heather? - Sally! Please... Please, I don't, I don't know where everyone is. But the ship's not deserted. I mean, maybe someone wants us to think that it is, but it's not. So let's just go to the bridge, find the skipper and then we'll go home. - I saw someone. - Fuck! Wait! Hello? Well, did you see who it was? Was it Heather? I didn't see. I'm sorry. Where are you going? - Why don't you just help me out? - What? Just wait for Vic. - What? - It's OK, it's fine. Why can't we go with him? Let's just do as Greg says and wait here for Victor, OK? Fine. - I think Victor is in danger. - I'm not worried about Victor! I'm sorry I'm acting weird, Greg, but I'm having deja vu every time I turn a corner! - No, no, no. - I know this place! No, you don't know this place. You're just in shock! - That's not it. - What is it? Is it Tommy? Is it guilt? Is that what it is? Do you feel guilty? Hello? Hello? Hello? - Around the third floor. - Greg. - The bridge is two floors above us. - Greg, that was blood. Are you just gonna ignore it? I know guys that work on ships like this. They get bored. - They're just... letting off steam. - What? They rescue us from the sea and then they just hide for fun? Yeah. Well, what's your theory? I don't know, but I'm not in shock. I'll be in the ballroom. I'm getting off this ship. Jess, fuck! Don't you see that this is all just in your mind? Jess! Ships don't magically appear out of nowhere. They have skippers. I mean, in your world, right now, maybe they don't. My world is waiting outside school for his mother to pick him up. Don't talk to me about my world. Hey, Jess... Jess, I'm sorry. Shit. Is that blood? Babe, come on, we're supposed to meet them in the theatre. Heather! Oh, my God. Shit! Sally... Sal, come on. Let's just go to the theatre. I can't see any more blood. I don't think she's in here. Honey, I don't think she's even on the ship. OK, so whose blood was that? Hello? Downey? Sally? Victor, what happened? Oh, my God! Stay with me, Greg. Stay with me. Stay with me, man. Downey, do something! - No! No! - You fucking bitch! You shot him! - What? - He said you shot him! - I didn't! - God, you're a liar! A fucking liar! - I wasn't even with Greg! - Jess, he is dead! He's dead! Look! God, you're a bitch! Oh, my... Get your hands off him! I didn't do it! I was with Victor. - Someone attacked him. - Someone? You think I did it? Why did you tell us to come to the theatre? I didn't! I... Sally, I didn't. - I didn't. - My God, you're a fucking schizo! Sally, no! - Jesus Christ! - Downey! - Sally! - No! Oh, God, no, honey! - Let him go. Let him go. - No! Honey! Honey! Don't shoot! Please! Please don't shoot. Please! I have a son. I have a son. Shit! Who are you? Tell me! - They'll return. - Who are you? And when they do, you have to kill them. - What the fuck are you saying? - It's the only way to get home. - What? - You have to kill them. Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! - Help us! - Over here. Help us! Hey, help us! - Over here! - Hey, come on! - Hey, help us! - Over here! Come on! - I see someone! - Help us! Please! - Hello! - Help! - Down here! - Hello! - Hey! Hey! - Down here! - Help us! Please! - Hey! There! There, over there! I can see somebody! Please! Come back! Hello? Looks like they scrapped the welcome. Let's go to the bridge. We'll get the captain to put a call out to the coastguard. Hello? Hello? Where the fuck is everybody? Do you know where we're going? Or are we just... just walking for the sake of it? - Are you alright? - I feel like I know this place. I recognise this corridor. Liners, they look... pretty similar. No, that's not it. Jess, come on. If this is the same ship, then this thing's old. Yeah. 1932. It is the same, see? Here's where we boarded. - The Ay-oh-lus. - Aeolus. "Aeolus was the Greek God of the winds and father of Sisyphus, a man condemned to the task of pushing a rock up a mountain only to have it roll down again." - Shitty punishment. What'd he do? - He cheated death. No, he made a promise to death that he didn't keep. I've studied it but I can't remember. Hello? Heather? Hello? Heather? - Heather! - Sally! Please... Please, I don't know where everyone is. But the ship's not deserted. Maybe someone wants us to think that it is, but it's not. So let's just go to the bridge, find the skipper and then we'll go home. I saw someone. Hello? Hello? Shit! How did you get here so fast? Victor, you gotta listen to me. We don't have much time. - What's going on? Where's Greg? - He's dead. - What? - No, no, no. I mean, he was dead. - He's not dead now. - What are you saying? Downstairs, right now, is a copy of myself. Me, walking and talking with Greg! Whoa, you're... What? Wait. No, no. There. - Just birds. - That was Downey's body. I just left Downey back there. - How did you get here so fast? - That's what I'm trying to tell you. No. Downey was there. It was... It was Downey's body! There are bodies all over the ship. Your body is on the floor of the restaurant with a hole in your head! Listen, I'm gonna do you a favour. I'm not gonna tell anyone about this. It's the truth! We've gotta get off this ship right now. - You're saying there's two of you? - Yes. - And I'm dead? - You were killed. OK! So, I'm dead, Downey's in the water and he's dead, too. Is Sally OK? You see where I'm going with this, right? If we're dead and there's two of you, how will we all get off this ship? We should never have boarded this ship. I knew something was wrong! I should've forced you to stay on the yacht, then you'd all be alive! I feel pretty alive right now. - Soon you'll be dead. - Easy! - It happened to you before! - I can't even believe I'm talking... It means you're gonna die. You'll die, and then Downey and Sally and Greg! God! I didn't do this! I didn't do it! We're on the third level. The bridge should be exactly... Greg, that was blood. Are you just gonna ignore it? I know guys that work on ships like this. They get bored. They're just letting off steam. Don't you see that this is all just in your mind? Ships don't magically appear out of nowhere. They have skippers. In your world,... maybe they don't. My world is waiting outside school for his mother to pick him up. Don't talk to me about my world. Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Can you hear me? Listen to me. Please, you have to listen! Who are you? If they board, kill them all. If they board, kill them. Who are you? Jess! Jess, you've got to kill them. Please, you have to listen. Don't let them board. No, no, no. Please... Please stop. If they board, kill them. Jess! Jess! You've got to kill them. If they board, kill them. No, please, please stop! If they board, kill them. Please... Please stop. Jess... Jess... Jess... Fuck you! Shit! Tommy... Is that blood? Come on, we're supposed to meet them in the theatre. Victor. I didn't mean to hurt you. You know I didn't mean to hurt you, right? Now, I'm gonna try and get us off this ship. OK? Sally? Sally? Sally? Victor, what happened? You're not me. You're not me! You see, I'm not crazy. Victor! This didn't happen before. Don't you see? You tried to strangle me, remember? Be strong. I'm gonna get the others. - Downey, do something! - Stay with me, man. Oh, d-do something! - I don't know what to do. - Is he dead? Greg! Are you OK? You fucking...! I won't hurt you. But we don't have much time. - Don't point that thing at my wife! - Move! Go, go, go! I hit her. I think I hit her. - What's going on? Who was that? - It's starting over again! Let's go. - We can't leave without Greg! - We'll come back for Greg. Come on! We can change the pattern. Don't you see? If we change the pattern, we're not trapped. Then we can get off this thing. - Jesus, she's fucking nuts! - You think? - You have to listen to me. - We don't have to listen to you! - Did I fire that shot? - I don't know! Whoa, whoa! Ladies! Can we take a breath here for a second? I am prepared to listen. I'm even prepared to believe you. - But start making sense. - I am making perfect sense! I'm gonna get Victor, then we get off this ship. Wait here. And don't trust anyone. If anyone comes, you shoot them. - What are you talking about? - You shoot them! What? Victor? Victor? I said, who is it? I said, who is it? It's me. Jess. Jesus Christ. What the fuck happened to you? Long story. - Where's Victor? - He's dead. He fell over the side. - How do we know you didn't kill him? - You don't. But if you wanna live, you'll follow me. - Downey? - Ignore it. Downey? - What's going on? - I said, ignore it. Where are you? Call out! No, I am not just gonna ignore it. What is going on? Fuck, where are you? Call out! You're in danger! You're in danger! Who is that? Not who you think. So, what are we doing in here? Sally! Wait! I'm sorry, but I love my son. Sally? That wasn't me! Sally? Sally? Hello? Hello? Please, can you hear me? Help me. Please, help me. She's killing everyone! They're dead. - They're all dead! Please help! - Sally? We hear you. What's your position? Over. - Sally. - Distress caller, what are your coordinates? Over. Coastguard, did you hear a distress call? Over. Greg? Greg, is that you? Distress caller, make another transmission. What is your position? Greg, can you hear me? Greg? Shit! Sally? Sally? - Oh, my God. What happened to you? - Get away from me! It wasn't me, Sally. I didn't do this to you. It wasn't me. - Where's Downey? - You know where he is! You killed him. What? No, I didn't. I didn't kill him. - What? - I swear. You're crazy. Why are you doing this? Sally, I know it's hard, but you gotta trust me. You gotta trust me, OK? Listen, you've gotta hold on. I think it'll return again. The yacht, the Triangle... I think it'll come back. If it does, we'll escape on it. Me and you together. We'll reboard it and escape. Please... Don't hurt me. Sally, I'm not gonna hurt you. If you hold on, you'll get to see Downey again. Hey, over here! Hey! Hey! Hey, help us! Over here! Hey, come on! - Help us! - It returns when they're dead. - There, I can see someone! - Hey, come back! It returns when everyone's dead. Do you think Heather made it on board? - Honey... - There's a chance. Yeah. Yeah, there's a chance. Stop this thing! Stop this fucking thing! Fuck off! Fuck this! Fucking...! Please... I wanna go home. I wanna go home! We don't have much time. - Where's Greg? - He's dead. - What? - He was dead. He's not dead now. I was hiding in the funnels and I saw this version of myself. She had blood on her face, and then I killed her on the front of the ship. I'm gonna do you a favour. I'm not gonna tell anyone about this. - You've gotta listen to me. - I'm not listening to another word! It means you're gonna die! You'll die, and then Greg and then Downey! God... Don't be scared, Victor. I can save you. I know how to save you. You should try and eat, babe. Jess? Jesus, what happened to you? Where's Greg? Greg told me to tell you we should meet in the theatre. There's a theatre? Yes. It's just that way. - Where are you going? - I'll see you there. OK, she's really starting to freak me out now. This is all just in your mind. Ships just don't magically appear out of nowhere. They have skippers. In your world, maybe they don't. My world is waiting outside school for his mother to pick him up. Don't talk to me about my world. Jess. Jess, I'm sorry. Whoa. H-Hey, just... OK. Take it easy, man. Just take it easy. What did we do? We're not part of this boat. We just got here, OK? We've been walking around, there's no one on it, you know. I can go right now. I will go. OK, just... just take it easy. Take it easy. OK? Jess? Jess? Just what are you doing? W-What is this? Why are you...? What are you wearing? I don't want you to see my face. - Why? - Because this is not me. I'm somewhere out there on the upturned yacht and you're with me. And after I kill you, we'll return. Is that right? You know what, why don't you just put down the gun first? OK? Come on. The boat comes back when you're all dead. I've done everything like before, but when the boat comes back, I'll be ready, I'll be waiting. I'll be on the landing bay. I won't let any of them board, even the other me. I'll make them all stay on the upturned yacht. OK, Jess, we'll do whatever you want. OK? Just... Just put down the gun. - Come on. - I'm so sorry! No, no, no, no! Greg! Oh, God! Help him! It was Jess. You fucking bitch! You shot him! He said you shot him! - I wasn't even with Greg! - Jess, he's dead! He's dead! My God, you're a fucking schizo! Downey! Oh, honey! Please! Don't kill me. I have a son. I have a son! No! Who are you? - Tell me! - They'll return. Who are you? They'll return. Kill them. It's the only way to get home. What the fuck are you saying? It's the only way to save our son. You have to kill them. Kill them! Kill them! Hurry up, sweetheart, you're gonna be late! What's the point in buying you things if leave them in the fucking garden? I'm sick of telling you this, Tommy! I ain't buying you any more toys if you can't look after the ones you've got! Now what? I'll just clean it up, shall I? Yeah, I'll just clean up the fucking mess! What's the matter with you? Huh? What's the matter with you? Just one day off is all I ask! Just one fucking day off! I don't know why you can't paint a picture like a normal kid. You know, you get this from your father. He was an asshole, too! Shit! Jack! Did you see anyone ring my doorbell? Tommy... Sweetheart, come here. Come here, sweetheart, it's OK. It's OK. Mommy's fine, you see? Mommy's fine. You were just having a bad dream, that's all, baby. That's all it was. Bad dreams make you think you've seen things that you haven't. Things are gonna be different now, Tommy. Mommy won't lose her temper any more. Even when you do things wrong. And she won't hurt you. I know she won't hurt you. You know how I know that, Tommy? Because that woman that did those things to you is not Mommy. This is Mommy. Mommy's nice. Shit! Shit! - Bird, Mommy! - Tommy, stay in the car. Mommy will bury it, OK? We have to get out of here. - Stop screaming, babe. - Blood! Please, Tommy. It's just blood. Stop screaming! Tommy, look, see? There. It's gone. See? There? It's gone. Are you alright? - Who are you? - Just a driver. No point trying to save the boy. There's nothing anyone can do that's gonna bring him back. Can I give you a ride? Yes. Take me to the harbour. Hey. I'll leave the meter running. You will come back, won't you? Yes. I... I promise. Jess. Do you know me? I feel like I do. Greg talks about you enough. - Where is Greg? - Where d'you think? Come on, you're late. - You're the one with the kid, right? - Yeah. How come you didn't bring him along? He's at school. - Are you sure about that? - Yes. - Are you OK? - I don't think so. Hey, what's the matter? What happened? - Hey! - I'm sorry. You've got nothing to apologise for. - What's the matter? - I'm just tired, that's... We don't have to go today. No, I do. I-I wanna go. Are you sure? Yeah. Yeah? OK, come on. - Sally, and her husband, Downey. - Hi. This is Heather. You remember Victor. So let's go sailing! - OK! - This is nice.
