The new casino tycoon brother Xin came to Macau in the '40s to make his fortune. After trials and tribulations, he finally struck a deal with the government in the '60s and obtained the license to run a casino. Although the new casino, New Garden, was oppressed by Wang Chang's gang, brother Xin, his partner, King of Ghosts and Guo Yingnan surpassed all obstacles and their gambling business took off. Brother Xin finally became the casino tycoon. As for his ex-lover, she took off with his son to a faraway place. In 1970, Hotel Lisboa opened for business. In the same year, the casino was opened, too. Xin chaired the Sociedade de Turismo e Divers√µes de Macau, while Mr. Nie became the managing director and general manager. The two fell out due to difference of opinion, and their stand-off worsened. Amazing. Master Ho. Is the Feng Shui of Lisboa really so impressive? Yes. It is intentionally set up this way. Its exterior resembles a bird cage. Once the gamblers enter, they will be like caged birds, going round and round in it. They won't know even if they have been skinned alive. The entrance is even more impressive. It's known as "Bat Sucking Money." Doesn't it look like an inverted bat? It's not just a bat, it's a blood-sucking bat. The red neon lights that are switched on 24 hours a day, are like the bat's claws. Once you enter, you'll be caught. The bat will only let you go when your wallet is sucked dry. This is called the eight-cornered flying hammer. Any man or animal within 490 feet will be hit. They'll use up all their money without realizing it. The ceiling in the lobby is adorned with pirate ships. Westerners are known to have made their fortune at sea. When in fact, they robbed underdeveloped places. Even before you enter the casino, the pirates in the lobby have already robbed you. Are you scared now? Let's not enter this way then. This place is worse. Why? There are two doors here. One is the exit. The other is the entrance, and they can't be mixed up. So, what should we do? That is the door to death. If one enters from here, he or she is bound to lose it all. Gamblers would rush in and they can only come out when they are left with nothing. So, where should we enter? This way. This is the only loophole. This is also the only way you can come out without losing. That's why all the staff enters and exits from here. We'll look out for the right time and the right opportunity. Start the attack before midnight and you'll surely win. Have you kept the three charms I gave you safely? Yes. Any affairs with women? Haven't even touched one for a week. Step on the seven stars with the seal of wealth, attack! Wait, the god of wealth is southwards. That's the seat. But we are here to make a windfall. God of fortune is at this seat. We'll surely win today. Four! I told you that we will surely win. Fourteen on a consecutive row. But the time has expired, let's retreat. Tips for you. What is it, Master? Unfortunately, his facial complexion is bad today. -Really? -Let's go back and gamble again. Good idea. Hey, those guys have won a lot. Master Nie, who would come if nobody wins? Do you know that the bald guy in sunglasses is the well-known Feng Shui master of Southeast Asia? Those Thai folks have invited him over to break our Feng Shui arrangements. Our architect is a foreigner. How would he know anything about Feng Shui? Who knows if you secretly hired someone to teach him? Master Nie, if one could win just by knowing Feng Shui, we would have gone bankrupt a long time ago. But they are really winning. I've been watching them for two hours. They would surely lose all they've won. The wealth position is located here. I'm now standing right on it. Let me try. No, let me do it. You've lost! You've lost our last two dollars! Beat him! Ah Xin, how did you know they'd lose to the last penny? They've been gambling for six hours and haven't looked at the watch once. That means they are gambling addicts. Addicts are doomed to lose. That's why I've always told others that there's no sure-win in gambling. Mr. Ho. What is it? Someone from the TV station wants to interview you. The PR Department has agreed. What's with those PR people? How can they just make agreements? People might think that I like to show off. Is it a man or woman? A lady called Di Yun. She's quite pretty. -Show her in. -All right. Miss Di, is it? Please wait. Mr. Ho hasn't asked you to go in yet. How arrogant. Who does he think he is? I'm sorry. This is a non-smoking area. So many rules. Might as well open a school instead of a casino. -Are you Miss Di Yun? -Yes. Mr. Ho has asked you in. Have a seat, please. Record every word I say. Yes. Mr. Ho, I'm representing the TV station here today. We want to do a special series for you, Mr. Ho. Also... We'll be holding a charity jogging event next month. We hope you can participate and be the captain of a team. Mr. Ho, I'm sorry. Mr. Nie has some urgent business. I'm sorry. What is it? Ah Xin, Niu Bit and Han Biu... These two loan sharks want to cause trouble here. -You better come back at once. -Why? Because of that territory in Bu Ye Tian. Niu Bit said that it belongs to him and Han Biu was not convinced. Can you handle them? What do you want me to do? You are now the company's chief executive. You better come back and handle it. I've business to deal with. Ask her to leave her number. I'm sorry, Miss Di. Mr. Ho has to rush to Macau for some urgent business. We will arrange for the interview some other time. I just need ten minutes. I'm sorry. Then let me talk to Mr. Ho myself. He has already left. This is so discourteous of him. Mr. Ho will apologize to you some other time. What a proud man. All right then. I won't give up. I must do the interview today. Mr. Ho. How is it? Niu Bit and Han Biu are up there. They want to wait for you to come back to settle it. These loan sharks are getting more and more unruly. They think the triad is supreme. Can a casino exist without triads? It's like a chicken and an egg. Where there's chicken, there'll be eggs and vice versa. Let's go. Mr. Ho, I've something to discuss with you. I don't have time now. Maybe later. -It's very urgent. -No need to be so rash. Ah Biu, get yourself a Thai chick! What's all the squabbling about? Mind your own business! I can do as I please! It's none of your concern! Damn you! Enough! You promised that you won't fight before Ah Xin comes back. You must honor your words. Master Nie, if Ho Xin doesn't come back for a year, does it mean I can't beat this bastard for a year? That's right. Ah Xin is too cunning. Who knows what tricks he'll be playing. What tricks will I be playing? You are finally here. What are you going to do? Don't worry. It's your show time. Brother Xin, it's good you are here. Initially, we were the only ones giving usurious loans. But since he came, he's been using mean ways to get my business. We were here first! My men said, if we are out of business, we might as well kill that bastard! Use your damn ass to think carefully. You think this is a first come, first serve system? If this is the case, Ah Xin should have asked Mr. Fu to be in charge here! In this society, those with power win! Kill this bastard! You are too much. You came too late. I should have dealt with the case myself. I told you I can handle this. How dare you say that? I'll polish your shoes if you can settle this! Ah Xin, don't think that we'll be afraid of you just because you took out your gun. You only have one gun with only 12 bullets in it. We have 20 men here. Can you kill us all? I know. I only need to kill the two leaders. What do you want? I just want you to stop for three minutes. Niu Bit, Han Biu. I want to talk to both of you. Come in. Brother Xin, nothing you say will be of any use! This fight is unavoidable. There's no room for discussion. That's right. You didn't even fight him. We've lost face already! How are we going to survive then? Well said, I agree that you must fight. But you, as leaders, need to ensure that your men don't get hurt. I have two knives here. I'll let whoever survives manage the loans business. No need to ask your men to fight all the time. Both of you should fight instead. It's the same. What? You're asking us to fight ourselves? Come on! Come! -I'll kill you, bastard! -Try if you have the guts! Attack! I have won! You're fighting me for real? Bastard! I'll kill you! Bastard, you're fighting me for real? I'm bleeding! You are always boasting, but when it comes to a real fight, you're cowards. Do you still want to fight? Let me suggest this. I'll kill you both and let someone else handle the business, all right? Brother Xin, it's just a minor misunderstanding. We can talk this out. We are friends. We should be able to settle it. We don't want to put you in a difficult position. That's right... Brother Xin, that's right. Here's 200,000 dollars, 100,000 each. Use them to pay for the boys' medical fees. Brother Xin, you've been so good to us. How can we still take your money? I don't agree with you. Brother Xin has good intentions. If I do not accept it, it would mean I am not sincere. Brother Xin, I'll take it to show my sincerity. Initially, I said that I shouldn't take anything. But in order to let you do some charity, I better take it and give it to them. That's right. Now that we've talked this out, let's pretend nothing has happened today. Let's go for a Jacuzzi! Let's go for a massage first! Sure! When are we going for a Jacuzzi? Better go for a massage first. Whatever you say. Brother, how did it go? -What are you still doing here? -How did it go? Hide the weapons! We should be brothers now! Everything is fine now? Mr. Nie, Mr. Ho has bought many new shoes. Ah Xin, you've settled the matter. I hope they will still listen to you in the future. Mr. Ho, I... I'm not in the mood to talk now. Let's talk tomorrow. Is Miss Di Yun's number real? -Try it. -All right. Damn it! You! There's no point killing me. Where am I supposed to get three million dollars from? No money? You dare gamble without money? Your interest is too high. A few hundred thousand became three million. What do we live on if we don't charge interest? You don't have money, but your boss does! Borrow from him! -Brother Xin won't lend me money. -Listen carefully. I have your wife and kids. If you don't have the three million by tomorrow, I'll sell her! Think about it! Let's go! What are you doing? Are you crazy? Close the door! Miss, who are you looking for? I'm looking for Mr. Ho. Are you Miss Di Yun? Your TV series is great. Really? Did you make an appointment with Mr. He? No, but I want to give him a surprise. -You must help me. -Me? We've known each other for two years today. You must keep this secret. Mr. Ho doesn't want anybody to know that we are friends. I understand. Just pretend you don't know that I went in. I will need your help again in the future. All right then. Why don't you go in and have a seat first? -Please sit down. -Thank you. Miss Di, I'll bring some photos later. -Can you sign them for me? -All right. Thank you. Mr. Ho, I don't want to do this. I really don't! I tried to talk to you this morning, but you never gave me a chance! I'm listening, speak. Mr. Ho, please lend me three million dollars. I owe them lots of money. They have my wife and kids. Please lend me some money. Mr. Ho, you have so much money. You wouldn't care about this small sum, right? I can help you solve the problem, but I can't lend you any money. I hate people threatening me. Today, you point a gun at me. Soon, everybody will point a gun at me. You bastard! You refuse to lend me the money, right? All right, I'll die with you! Put the gun down now and I won't report this to the police. You're lying! You treated Wang Chang ruthlessly. How can you possibly let me go easily? Let me tell you, when you step out of the lift, you'd better walk quietly to your office. If not, I'll just blow your head off! The lift is here, come on. Mr. Ho. Don't let anyone come in. I have things to talk about with Ah Hu. Yes, Mr. Ho will not be taking any calls. Don't put any calls through. Give me a cup of coffee. Mr. Ho never drinks coffee. Put down the gun first, aren't you tired? No, I want to rescue my family! The loan sharks have been pushing you hard, haven't they? Just think, are they more powerful or are we? Once I report this to the police, you won't be able to go anywhere. Where can you hide? You have no idea. Now, I'm at a dead end. I don't have a choice. If you're wise, ask Ah Gao to bring in three million and go to Hong Kong with me. Or else, I'll just blow your head off and kill myself! This is bad. Stop talking nonsense. Go in! Please come in. Hurry up and make the call. I want three million in cash. Numbers on the bills shouldn't be in a series, I'll check. Then go aboard the ship with me! You're so naive. You think you can return to Hong Kong? Once you land, you'll be arrested. It's a dead end. I don't care! Only you can save yourself now. I won't make the call. You decide for yourself. Ah Hu, you've been with me for five years. I've never treated you badly. I treat you like my own family. Put the gun down. I promise that if you give yourself up, I'll rescue your family. You have my word. How did this happen? How did this happen? Who are you? Don't shoot! You hid a woman here to eavesdrop, huh? You despicable bastard! I didn't know that she was here. Get him! -Don't move! -Ho Xin, you despicable bastard! You'll suffer for this! Even if you don't, your good friend will! You bastard! We've heard everything. You're going to jail! Forget it. Take him away. -Take him away! -Move! Mr. Ho, are you all right? I'm fine. How did you know that I'm in trouble? You always have an upset stomach after coffee, but strangely, you asked for coffee. So I knew that something was wrong. How clever. Get us to the hospital. Why you are here? I thought I could do an interview with Mr. Ho. You know I can get you arrested! By the way, Ah Hu's family has been taken away by those loan sharks. Help me handle this. He's a traitor. Why are you still so good to him? I want to know if I will end up famous. Why are you laughing? Is the lady inside OK? Yes, she's slightly wounded. I want to go in and have a look. All right, she can go anytime. Are you all right? You were smoking? You almost died. You didn't have to do that to get a promotion. The police said they want you back for questioning. I turned it down for you. I don't want this news to spread. Your mouth has smoke. No, the room is very cold. But it's much warmer now. When you interview me, it won't be that hard. You agree to be interviewed? But I need to handle something first. You can interview me in the car for 15 minutes. That's good enough. -I'll wait for you in the car. -OK. Since this is a charity walk, I'll join in. Thank you, Mr. Ho. About that series... Let's talk about this later, OK? Where are we going now? None of your business. Ah Gao, go up with me later. All right. Wait for me here. Mr. He-- Ah Xin, are you here? Your ear is getting better and better. I wanted to scare you. This house is so quiet. How can I possibly not know when someone is here? What happened to your hand? It's nothing. I twisted my arm when I was playing tennis. You are not young anymore. Be very careful. Mrs. Ho. Ah Gao. Sorry, I'm late today. It's only 5:15. Mr. Ho is punctual. I've been with him for five years and he always comes back before 5:00. Shut up and deal the cards. Let's see who has better luck today. Look at the cards. Here is my combination. I lost again. I lost 600. There you go. Why are you so lucky? Ah Xin, Tian-erh faxed in today saying that she and Tianbao will be coming back from Hawaii next week. They're coming back so soon? She said she wants to introduce her boyfriend to us. Wow, an American boyfriend? What if he is an African American? He'd be singing all day, I guess... Look at you, a man of your age ought to behave. What a hypocrite. I bet he is hiding a woman here. I'm going to expose you. -You brought someone with you? -No. Miss, come in, please. Sorry. Didn't I ask you to wait downstairs? It's OK, come in. I love to watch your TV soap opera. You're great. You're too kind. Have a seat. Ah Xian! Mrs. Ho, what can I do for you? Give Miss Di some tea. -Pardon me. -It's all right. Ah Xin, how could you ask her to wait downstairs? Ah Xian! You want to die? Not so hard! They are chatting. Let's relax. I want to ask you! Where were you last night? You didn't even give me a call. I bet you're going to say that you were with Mr. Ho. You're right. We were entertaining guests from Taiwan. I was drunk even before we had shark fins. -Swear by it. -That's not necessary, is it? Repeat after me! If I came into contact with females of any kind last night, I'll get poisonous boils all over my body, I'll eat shit and my share prices will plummet, my car will be stolen, and each night, a ghost will disturb me till dawn! You've always had a sharp tongue, but it's getting worse. I should be mean to you men. I bought you a watch. Really? Is it a Rolex, Piaget, Baume & Mercier, or Chopard? Come back for soup tonight. It's a Seiko. Go and eat shit! Get out of my way! Ah Xian! -Miss, tea. -Thanks. It's inconvenient for me to move about. I don't want to run around with Ah Xin. So, I live here all by myself. Ah Xin will come and keep me company every day at 5:00. Take Miss Di to the pier. Yes. Mrs. Ho, Mr. Ho, goodbye. Drop in when you're free. Goodbye. If you don't buy me an expensive watch, I'll engrave the words "I have AIDS" on your body. You can't do that. How do you know if I don't try? I would be dead before you finish. At least I could finish the word "I." -See you tonight. -See you tomorrow. -Not tomorrow. -Why? Your relative is coming soon. Who? Big Aunt. Cheap! Damn it! Why are you smiling? Good taste. No way. You think she and I... I have been paralyzed for 20 years. You've been good to me. A normal man should have a girl with him. Otherwise he'd be abnormal. Don't be silly. I exercise and swim often. I am normal. Look at you, you lose a few hundred to me every day. You give up even though you have a good hand. I really hope I can help you find a decent girl. Don't think too much. I only have eyes for you. I know you love me, but I know that in your heart she'll always be number one, and I'll be number two. I know this very well. I have forgotten her. I really wouldn't mind. Don't talk about these things. I'll be unhappy. I'm leaving. See you. Mr. Ho, you have improved after your hand has recovered. Stop sucking up to me. I am out of breath. Can't take it anymore? I can't move. You are 10 years younger than I am and yet, your stamina is worse. I'm exhausted from having too much sex. Naturally, my stamina is weaker. Are you mocking me because I have no girlfriend? It's just that you don't want any. Actually, Miss Di is not bad. If I were you, I would have chased after her. She might reject you. I'll think of a plan for you. Give her a diamond watch. Then, take her on a trip to Europe. When did you become a matchmaker? I was worried that you might feel shy. Actually, Miss Di is good to you. Really? How can she possibly like an old man? Girls nowadays like mature men. Really? But I don't know if you are still capable. It's been a long time. I don't know either. I can't help you with that. I'm leaving. It's your birthday. I want to treat you to a meal. Sorry, I already have an appointment. Could you not see Ah Xian for a day? I don't want to see her. I have an appointment with someone more beautiful. Are you serious? I didn't tell that bitch that it is my birthday. -Please don't tell her. -All right. A lady is here to see you, Mr. Gao. Coming. Take care. Keep it up. Why are you here? It's your birthday and I know that you are lusty. So, I came to give you a special present. Who is she? What do you mean? Do I need to tell you everything? Idiot, what are you looking at? Lower you head when men are talking! Get back to Macau at once! If you come here, who would be responsible if something happens to Mrs. Ho? You are neglecting your duty! I have always been proud to have a responsible girlfriend like you! But you disappointed me! Lower your head! I only have one feeling now. It's heartache! I cannot take this anymore! I'm going to play squash! You're impressive. I better make this clumsy situation appear casual. Come on, let's play. Trust me. There's nothing between us. Everyone is talking about this. What is untrue may become true. You don't have faith in me? It's not that. It's just that you didn't earn my trust. Cut! Thank you. Miss Di, this is from Mr. Ho. Thank you. LET'S HAVE DINNER AT THE USUAL PLACE, ALL RIGHT? I'll go myself. All right. CITY WEEKLY ISSUE: ACTRESS DI YUN AND CASINO TYCOON XIN HAVE CLOSE CONTACT. Mom, I miss you. You've lost some weight. No, I haven't. I'm more or less the same as before. Mr. Ho, you're back! Is Dad back? Dad! Dad, you're so annoying! You scared me! Let me look at you. I really don't understand. Why do you like your steak so rare? It gives me power. Cavemen used to eat like this, too. This is a dog-eat-dog society. It's just that you don't know it. Dad! Tianbao. Dad. Come back and help Dad. Of course. This is my good friend, Cheng Zhen. He is Tian-erh's boyfriend. How come he's not an African American? Mr. Ho, pleased to meet you. Hi. I have faith in my children's choices. You must be very capable. No matter how capable I am, without opportunities, nothing would happen, right? Ah Zhen is very interested to work in our entertainment company. How much do you know about casinos? In what aspect? If I ask you to manage a casino, what preparations would you make a month in advance? I would analyze the location of the casino and distribution of the gangs. Wouldn't you learn how to gamble? You have experts in that area. Once everything is on track, knowing how to gamble is not important anymore. The crucial thing is to balance interests and give customers a safe haven to enjoy. Business will naturally be good. Otherwise, you would not be the leader now. It would be Mr. Nie Aotian instead. Dad, Ah Zhen and I would be able to help you with our talents. I fear your talents are inadequate and you'll make a mess instead. In Hawaii, I beat up some Japanese gangsters so bad that they all lay dead. Don't think I don't know that the ones who were lying down were Japanese girls. Let's eat. I give you a month's time to do what you just said. After a month, come to work. I won't let you down. I admire pride in a young man. Let's eat. What's wrong? Can't sleep? I'm thinking about something. Our kids are back. What else is there to think about? It's about Tian-erh's boyfriend. What's wrong with him? You don't like them sleeping in the same room? It's a modern world now. If that kid is irresponsible, I'll castrate him. You're fooling around again. His eyes remind me of someone. Who? They look familiar. But I can't recall who they look like. You think too much. Go back to sleep. Let's order a pair of bracelets tomorrow as a dowry for our daughter. Sleep now. All the best! Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for watching our program. Walkathon for the celebrities. This event will go on for a few hours. This is Hu Shou Xin reporting live with my partner Lin Yi. That's right, donations have reached 21 million. The latest news indicates that the competition is fierce. The teams Little White Dragon and the Yellow Warriors are leading. Their representatives for the final journey are tycoons Guo Yingnan and the new star Hong Kong Princess Ms. Zhu Linlin. There's also our top donor Mr. Ho Xin and Miss Di Yun representing the Rose team, and Mr. Nie Aotian leading the Peanuts team. They are ready for the final relay. Introduce me to Zhu Linlin. I told you. Anyone who parts his hair in the middle is a pervert. Flirt all you want, but don't ask for Dad's help. Otherwise, I might as well just get together with her. You idiot! Talk to the teacher in English. You think I can't speak in English? Am I right? She's smiling at me. Wouldn't you if you saw gold? You are a piece of gold chasing her. Of course she'll smile. This is a great looking girl. Great figure. Take a look at this great view. A good body to give birth. Go after her. I'll go then. Ah Xin, allow me to introduce my English teacher. Careful with your words, understand? What do you mean? I spent a lot of money to get him to specially teach me English foul language. Otherwise how can I deal with those westerners? I heard that recently, you've been busy with the lady beside you. I told you to watch your words. Hello, Mr Guo. I am Di Yun. Hi, he... Can you watch your tongue? Don't pretend. What is there that I don't know? If you won't, I will. When we get to the TV station, don't talk nonsense. Tian-erh and Tianbao are with Ah Mei over there. You are the one talking nonsense. You tricked them into waiting for you at the TV station while you flirt with girls here. Why are you lying? We are brothers, right? Ah Xin, you didn't remarry. You've been faithful to Ah Mei. Ah Nan, I am an old man. You said it. I didn't. I can take mine out now and it still works well. You can. But I can't. Nie Aotian, that old fox. What's wrong with him lately? I don't feel right about him. He's been going against me lately. What an asshole! Remember when he begged us to return to Macau, he was like a dog! "Sir..." Let's not talk about him. Let's go. Ladies and gentlemen, fierce competition between the Yellow Warriors and Little White Dragon. They'll be here soon. YELLOW WARRIORS LITTLE WHITE DRAGON Your turn. I know. Hurry! -Your turn. -I know! Faster! Hurry! -All the best, Dad! -I stepped on you. I did it on purpose, so? Dad, all the best! Hurry! Damn, we are so slow. We are bound to lose. Let's do our best for the charity. WALKATHON FOR THE CELEBRITIES Yes, that's right. Got it! I just received news. All teams have set off for the last lap. The one currently leading is the beautiful Zhu Linlin and Mr. Guo Ying Nan. Do you think your dad will be the last one today? That would be embarrassing. Hurry! Looks like we are bound to lose. This way we can relax. Miss Di Yun, please give us your autograph. -All right. -Thanks. Wait for me. I'm losing anyway. I'll be a gentleman and wait. -Congratulations, Miss Zhu Linlin! -Wait! What are you doing? Mr. Guo is here, too! Both of them are fighting to reach the finish line. -I won! -Our champion is Miss Zhu Linlin! I won! I am a soft-spoken lady. I've won! I'm the champion! I don't know you. I won! -The second place goes to... -I protest! I would have won if I was not molested just now! I protest against her championship! Dad, this is a live TV program. You bastard, you are not human. You bullied your dad with that airhead! I like her. Dad, this is really a TV station. It's all right. Keep dancing. Guess how your dad will do. Don't run! This is great! Dad, she's smiling at me again. Asshole. She just molested your dad. You still have the guts to laugh? Fine. I'll stop laughing. Let me tell you. Make an effort and go after her. You must get her! Don't make me lose face! Dare to fight against me? I'll let my son deal with you. Ah Gao, how come Mr. Ho is not back yet? Let me go out and have a look. Miss Di Yun from the Rose team is back! ROSE -She's back! -The one behind is Mr. Ho from the Sapphire team. -Miss Di Yun! -Thank you. Daddy! All right, all eight teams are back now. Here's the result. The Champion of the first Walkathon for the celebrities is the Yellow Warriors team. Great! The one who's got the most donations is Mr. Ho from the Sapphire team. Ah Gao. Mrs. Ho, what is it? Mr. Ho is wounded. Don't make a scene. He doesn't want others to know. Arrange a car and take him to the hospital. All right. Everyone, the Walkathon for the celebrities has now come to an end. Thanks for watching, goodbye! Ah Xin, are you all right? I'm fine. Don't let anyone know. Ah Xin! -Daddy! -Ah Xin! Daddy! Ah Xin, are you all right? Ah Xin! Are you all right? -Ah Xin! -Dad! Call the ambulance! -Dad! -Daddy! I must find those bastards! No use. If I were to kill a celebrity like Mr. Ho, I would have hired someone to do it for me. Besides, I'm all right now. He would hide and wait for the next opportunity. Security has been tightened in Mr. He's residence and offices in Hong Kong and Macau. It's late. Go back first. Tianbao, go back with Mom. Miss Di. -What are you doing here? -I came to see Mr. Ho. Ever since you appeared, bad things have happened to my father! Do you want to destroy our family or kill my dad? Tianbao! Tianbao, don't talk nonsense. Sorry, Miss Di. Come in. Let's go. I want to check if the security people are here. He's right. Since you met me, many things have happened to you. I fear that you and I are incompatible and that I bring bad luck to you. Why do you believe in these things? Ah Xin, I am afraid. Of what? That something might happen to you. Every time I see your wife, I feel guilty. I feel so much pressure being with you. I cannot let others know and I cannot share this with others. We can't meet any time we like. It's a painful feeling. Did I hurt you? No, I feel your pain. I am serious. You are happy with me? Yes. All right then. But will we end up together happily? May I come in? Your senior? He brought me here. Please come in. Sorry. They are asking me to move my car. I'm fine. You can go. I'll wait for you downstairs. You must be careful. I will. But we can't meet often for some time. I sense that someone is plotting something against me. I have a hunch that the enemy I'm facing this time is the worst one in my life. Ah Xin, congratulations. -Greetings to uncle and aunt. -Hurry. Ah Xin, I wish you good years ahead, and get the most out of those gamblers. May your good words come true. Sister-in-law, I wish you youth and beauty forever. Tianbao, keep working hard and help your dad soon. So, he'll have time to accompany me to flirt with women. You're an old man. You're still fooling around this way. What are you waiting for? Give the red packets. That's why I've asked you to come... You want to keep them for yourself? You take care of it. I've prepared red packets for them, too. Come and thank uncle and auntie. Thank you, Uncle. You're welcome. Ah Xin, let's play mah-jong later. I want my capital and interest back. Ah Xin, our kid was so impressive. He finally managed to get Zhu Linlin and will get married soon. You must come to the wedding. Sure. How is it going with Di Yun? I haven't thought about these things. As my English teacher says, past tense means in the past. Ah Xin, there are both sides for everything. I don't know what you're thinking, but I know what your dick wants. What's there to fear? One must sow some wild oats. Why isn't your English teacher with you? Don't talk about him. He called me a Chinese pig behind my back. I wanted to let him get away. Then I thought I'll call God on the phone to discuss it. God said that he needs to be punished. So that when he is walking, he will break his nose, his teeth, his arm and his leg. You still harbor those men? Yes, but don't get me wrong. My men haven't touched him. God punished him. You are becoming more cultured. I hired a Chinese teacher to teach me Chinese. Ho also teaches me how to write modern poetry. Really? Recite some poetry for me. Oh, beautiful woman. You are a cloud in the sky. When I see you, I get high. You are a sock. I am the foot. You're a hot dog. I am the sausage. You are a fat ass and I am a fritter boiling inside you. Dad is great! Clap for him! Since you like my poems, I'll recite more. That's enough. Ah Xin, I've been going to karaoke often lately. Let me sing a few songs. One, three, eight, five I'm no longer alone Dad, you're off key. Don't sing anymore. You spoil my fun. What are you saying? I'll be politer. My teacher taught me. Ah Xin, Mr. Nie is here. Congratulations. Congratulations. Wishing you good health, Mr. Nie. I wish you great prosperity so that you can retire soon. Mr. Nie, I wish you virility in your old age. Of course! Who is this? He's just started working for me. His name is Tai Tung. Congratulate Mr. Ho. Mr. Ho, hope you turn every piece of bad luck into good. -What did you say? -Tianbao, back off. Mr. Nie, didn't you teach your men well? How can he say such unlucky things during new year? I'm so sorry. Tai Tung, what day is today? How can you say such things? Please forgive me, Mr. Ho. No big deal. A pair of aces. Mr. Nie, it's your call. A pair of aces. I'll put in 500,000. I'll follow. I'll see if you're bluffing. I'll put in an additional one million. Ah Xin, your turn. What do you think? I'll follow. It may be a pair of jacks and ten or three jacks. Unfortunately, you're playing against me. I'll follow. And an additional three million. Great, if you are afraid, don't follow. -Same goes to you. -Asshole! You are not welcome here, get out! Do I need to do as you say? I'm here to protect Mr. Nie. Then, I'll kill you! Tianbao. Stay calm. I'm so sorry. Please forgive his ignorance. Let's continue. Come. It's all right. But there are times when you have to respect your superior. You've been in charge of the casino for many years. But don't forget, we still have a couple of shareholders here. If business is not good, you'll be dismissed even if we're old friends. Three million, are you going to follow? Three million? I'm not afraid of you! Ah Xin, don't be afraid of him. I'll support you. Follow. Add ten million. Even if you have got three kings, aren't you afraid that I have three aces? I wonder if he'll follow. Things change. Draw the cards. Ah Nan, this jack should be yours. That's right, it should be mine. I am so damn stupid. I've told you before, things change. My call, show hand. You are really not afraid of my three aces? You have three aces? I'll "show" you instead of you "showing" me. That's right. Ah Xin, you're impressive. Today is the second day of the lunar year. I still have a whole year to play. I quit. I don't believe that you have three aces. I only have a pair of kings. I just don't understand why you didn't follow. You lack guts because you're old? You've taken advantage of us! Clearly, you don't respect my boss! I'm going to beat you up! Tianbao, how dare you talk like this in here? You think this is your territory. So, I have to be afraid of you? You have no right to speak here! Tai Tung, stop. I'll deliver the money to you tomorrow. Let's go. You better watch out. Mr. Nie! Damn, this old fart. Causing trouble in the new year. He must be tired of living. Ah Xin, never mind him. Let's play. Dad, why didn't you teach him a lesson? You are supposed to be educated. Why are you so violent? I've sent you to study abroad! What have you achieved? You should learn from Ah Zhen! Tianbao, don't talk back to your father. How come you are not on my side? Tianbao, that's not true. Enough. Forget it. Let's go for a drive! Let's go! Tianbao, don't drive too fast! Mom, how did it end up this way? These people have been winning for six days. They only play blackjack, but they win more than they lose. And they are winning big money, too. The odds of winning are raised with big bets. Did you search them? Why do you suspect them? Calculator. Even if they have it, they didn't take it out. We didn't notice they swapped cards and made a mark on the cards. Even you couldn't see their tricks. I don't think they are swindlers. They must have used tricks. It's just that we were deluded. Tai Tung, go down and ask them to leave. Wait. Master Nie, you used to disagree with such an action. It's different now. Now the real pros have come to take advantage of us. We must teach them a lesson. If we use force, I won't agree to that. You object? All right, settle this at tomorrow's board meeting. Ah Xin. These people have won over 30 million dollars. We can't tell what they have done. You've got to stop this. What are you insinuating? I haven't conspired with them. I didn't say that. I just don't want to see them here again. I've checked it out. These people have no records in casinos all round the world. That is to say, they are not professionals. Unless they are proven to be swindlers, they are gambling legally. I didn't say they are not allowed to win. I just want them to know that if they keep winning, everybody will be unhappy. Didn't the Dice Gang win as much money back then? You let them go easily. We are running a casino. Winning and losing is common. You taught me this, right? Mr. Nie, not everyone can be as aggressive as you when they are old. Some people may regress. Guts diminish with age, haven't you heard that? Disrespectful kid! Who are you to say anything here? Damn you! We are having a meeting, not a triad negotiation. Sit down. Mr. Ho, no point arguing. We better think of something and vote on it. Good idea. Sounds more civilized. You are in charge of this casino. You'd better settle this in the next 24 hours. Handle those swindlers. If not, I'll take charge. If you don't have the guts, I do. If you don't have manpower, I do. When I first came to Macau, I only had 10 dollars. Now, with some luck, I have some money. My humble business has grown into an empire. Every day, someone wants to kill me. Every day, someone wants me dead. I have survived until now and it is no sheer luck. You dare threaten me with that nobody? This is not a joke. You know I hate joking around. I'm not joking either! You have no guts, bastard. You want to threaten me? Are you capable? You were incapable back then! Don't think I wouldn't fight you when I'm wearing a suit! I, too, can be a rascal when I take off my tie! You need not be afraid. I am a man of principles. Whoever treats me nicely, I'll treat him nicely, too. Whoever is harsh with me, I can be even harsher. As the Director of the Board, I'm ordering you to put down your cigar. There are rules for everything in this room! Did you work in casinos for over 20 years for nothing? No matter what, I am still the leader. That's right. All right, those who agree to let Mr. Nie handle the gamblers after 24 hours, please raise your hands. Dad told me to stand on your side no matter what. He didn't mean it literally. Please go back and sit down. I think it's more fair to every shareholder. Mr. Ho, are you speechless now? Mr. Nie, don't worry. I still have 24 hours. Tomorrow, we'll see who is the one without guts. Let's go. Mr. Ho, are you all right? I'm fine. Brother, take good care of yourself since you're old now. Having too much sex will kill you. Mr. Nie, you still have a dog over there. I'll take you to a doctor. No need. Take the video tape back to Hong Kong. I have to find out how they win our money. -Yes. -Let's go. Mr. Ho. They've tried their best to clean Tianbao up. Mr. Ho. I'm all right. Take him out and let me have a look. Why? Why did they do that to my son? Someone saw that Tianbao was hit by a water truck. What about Ah Zhen? Was Ah Zhen there? He said he had a flat tire. A cab passed by and helped him change it. We didn't see any enemies around. I think this is Nie Aotian's doing. No, he just argued with me. It's too obvious to kill my son like that. He's a patient man. Then who could it be? I don't know. Spend some money and get some information on this. Pass the word around to all the seniors. Whoever finds out who the murderer is, I'll owe him a favor. Many other gangs are helping us. Don't let Ah Mei know. I got it. They don't seem like swindlers. I feel the same way, too. Looks like they were doing some calculations. Our casino doesn't allow clients to bring in calculators. They didn't have pen or paper, how can they calculate? He's shaking all the time. How could he win? They have won over 10 million. Which one? This one. Zoom in on him. Morse code. There's a small coding machine hidden in the shoe. They convey their signal to a hotel room. They have someone who does the calculations for them and tells them what to do. How? That is his partner. Ho has a hearing aid. It's actually a receiver. When the calculations have been done, they forward the message to him. Then, he controls the stakes. -Did he win the most? -Yes. So, they are not swindlers. They are mathematicians. I've a plan to make them return all the money. Don't use these old card boxes again. From now on, for Baccarat and Black Jack, use these boxes. Use four decks of cards for Blackjack. Mr. Ho, why's that? The new card box has a cover. Even if the player leaves sweat from his hands, when we deal the cards, they won't be able to see the marks left by the first one. Some gamblers like to calculate, that's why we use four decks. The order of cards for Poker will be increased manifold. But they can still do calculations. That's why we have a white card. Each time before we deal, we ask a customer to insert it into the deck. When it appears, it means the deck is finished. One more thing. To prevent arguments on whether the last player wants a card, a card will be drawn out when it comes to the Banker. -You understand? -Yes. Want to check the cards? What is that? New card box. From today, we'll use four decks of cards. CHANGED TO FOUR DECKS. CAN IT BE CALCULATED? Though complicated, we could still calculate it. Sir, fruits for you. Don't move. The next five cards are in our favor. We've a high chance of winning. Increase the stakes. Wait. Please go there. What do you want? Over there! -Search them. -Don't move. Hear that? Mr. Gao. Mr. Ho. Very nice indeed. Do you have anything else to say? I bet you have lost everything by now. I've prepared the boat tickets for you. I'll let you go this time. But don't ever let me see you again! Let's go! Mr. Nie. Swindlers! Teach them a lesson! Beat them! Don't let them go! Never mind them. What's going on? I want to catch them all! You nab those I've released. You don't respect me at all. I've reported it to the police. They must be arrested! Mr. Ho, what's with you? Mr. Ho, how can you let swindlers go? You look unwell. You should take a break from the Board of Directors. You... That's right. Ah Zhen is good enough to replace you. You should rest. Hurry and take Mr. Ho to the hospital! Hurry, call the ambulance! Make way! Mr. Ho had a heart attack and is hospitalized. The doctor says that for six months, he should take it easy. So, Nie Aotian will replace him as the Board Chairman. Effective immediately. He has also promoted Cheng Zhen as the Manager. A great storm has just begun. -Ah Xian. -What are you doing here? After young master passed away, Mr. Ho has been depressed every day. I was forced to cry with him. I have been in a bad mood every day. My lips and eyes are squeezed together now. So, what? I want to relax. Relax? Come, let me massage your face for you. Massage the face? How? On the face, rub it. You'll feel comfortable after that. No facial massage. Do something else. Like what? Massage elsewhere, too. Elsewhere? You are shameless! How dare you talk to me like that! Shameless! Let go of me! -Miss. -Why are you so happy? Nothing. Actually, I'm very depressed. Forget it. The dead can't come alive. If you don't want to massage me, then let me massage you. Shameless! What are you doing? You know what you've done. What are you talking about? What am I talking about? How come there's a woman's picture in your pocket? Speak! Are you crazy? Look at the picture. It's so old. Its color has faded. That woman is at least 90 years old now. Give it back to me. No! Give it back to me. No! I'm asking you for the last time. Give it back to me! Who is this girl? That's enough. Go away! Congratulations, Benny. Your wife is so beautiful. I give you my blessing. Thank you, I'll treasure it. Ah Xian, help me pour some tea. This girl is so beautiful. I bought it from an antique shop. Give it back to me. Comfort my daughter first. I'll return it to you later. All right. I'm so worried about Mr. Ho. He has been so depressed. He's lost his position. You better find another job. Mr. Nie wants to talk to you. Get in the car. Mr. Gao, you have nothing much to do at Mr. Ho's. Come and work with me instead. My pleasure. I'll let you be the casino chief supervisor. Only Ah Zhen is above you. Mr. Nie, what about me? You are the third in command. You are already great now. Ask your girlfriend to come over, too. This is great. What can she do? What did she do at Mrs. Ho's place? Help her bathe, wash her underwear. Then do the same here. Help you bathe? Don't worry. I seldom bathe. What about the underwear? Don't worry about that either. I don't wear underwear. That's great. The monthly salary for the two of you will be $50,000. Great! You'll be in charge of one territory. Great! I'll also take care of your kid's education expenses. There'll be one month's long leave. Great! You'll be provided with accommodation. Great! Start work tomorrow. That's not possible. Why not? I have no pride, no shame no feelings, no conscience, but I still have a little integrity. Mr. Ho is in trouble. I can't leave him. You can keep dreaming! Bastard, how despicable! Get out of the car! Great! I will take my revenge sooner or later. You were so manly just now. I've always been manly. You don't have to tell me that. How should I reward you? Tonight I'll... Whatever you want. I want to go to the nightclub tonight. Go to hell! Look at you! Ah Xin, you neither smoke nor drink. You appear to be a good kid and yet, you have had a heart attack. Ah Xin, what happened to you? Why is your body so weak? Ah Xin, you should learn from me. Doctor, let me tell you. I have all kinds of addictions. Eating, drinking, womanizing, gambling and smoking. I have sex all night. Not only that, after that, I play football immediately, and tennis, too. I'm as strong as a bull. Forehand, backhand, so deadly. Let me rest for a while. Why is your room so far from the main entrance? -Wipe away your sweat. -Thank you. If I learned from you, I'd be dead. Nonsense! You want me to be dead soon? Hurry and recuperate. When you're better, I'll kick you back to Macau. That bastard Nie Aotian. Who is he to take your place? Damn it. I'm sorry. I need to talk to him in private. All right. I'll leave you alone. Ah Xin, you do this every day. Aren't you bored? Ah Xin, what are you doing? You want to die? You have heart disease. Please don't do that. Get up. Be careful. Do I look like I have heart disease? You were pretending? If I didn't pretend to be sick, that cunning Nie Aotian wouldn't have exposed himself. Ah Xin, do you really think I am that stupid? I knew from the very start that you have plans. How can your body possibly deteriorate so suddenly? What do you intend to do? I don't trust anyone now. Only you can help me. Of course. I can help you with anything except my dick. Ah Nan, I know that you have a wild card. Can you lend it to me? The tiger's going to show its fury, right? I don't mind anyone going against me. But I must find out who killed Tianbao. Is it tasty? Of course. Feed me more. Don't be disgusting. My brother hasn't had his way yet. Never mind him. You're annoying. Hoes before bros. What kind of bro are you? Come down! Mr. Gao, it's done. -Drag him to one side. -Yes. -After them! -Don't run! Don't move! I know that you killed Ho Tianbao. Who sent you? Speak! I have my principles. You want me to speak? I might as well die! Tough guy. Let's see if your wife is as tough. Drag her to the room. Hubby! What do you want? Nothing. I'm afraid you are too short to satisfy your wife. So, I asked a few friends to give you some help. Don't do that! If you touch my wife, I'll kill you! With what? Brothers, have a good time. Wifey! Wifey! The African American sizes are huge. She wouldn't be able to take it much longer. Fine, I'll speak. But first, let go of my wife. Who's the mastermind? Is it Nie Aotian? No, it's Mr. Cheng. Mr. Cheng? It's Cheng Zhen! You promised to let my wife go! Come out! Please. What does this mean? It was just a special show for you. That woman is called Horny Lin. She acted as your wife. She dressed up as a man and went in with them. We don't do despicable things. We didn't touch your wife at all. You're something. Cheng Zhen. Yes. 3774, Honolulu, Hawaii. Is this address correct? My friend in Hawaii found this out for me. It should be correct. How's Mr. Ho? He's chatting outside. Ah Xin, what those guys said might not be true. Whether it's true or not, I can tell. Ah Gao. Mr. Ho. Did Niu Bit and Han Biu quarrel again? Worse than last time. Do it well. Are you going to that charity basketball match? Why not? I made a promise. I will keep my word. But there's a lot of rumors saying that Tai Tung will harm you. I'm not afraid of people plotting against me. I am mentally prepared for that. How can I run my business if I am afraid of things like this? Hurry up and go. Ah Xin, we have been buddies for so many years. No matter what you do, I'll always be on your side. But this time, I must advise you to think very carefully. Ah Bao is dead. Ah Zhen is your son-in-law. If you kill him, Tian-erh will be heartbroken. Ah Nan, I've never thought of killing him. It's God who will be punishing him. On the day of his funeral, I'll be the one who will cry the most. You understand? Are you Mrs. Cheng? I haven't seen you for so many years. I never expected to see you today. The sky is so gray... I think I am truly an unfortunate person. My heart is grayer than the sky. I am a Catholic. I never believe in horoscopes. But if you really have to check it, I must be having a hard life. I was ill-treated after Mom died when I was just a kid. My leg was paralyzed when I was 27. Maybe I'm doomed not to be worthy of having a good husband like Ah Xin. God took my legs in exchange for Ah Xin. I'm no better. I've never harmed anyone in my life. How come such disasters fall upon my children at my old age? I don't understand. Cheng Zhen is your son? What happened to him? You don't know what he did? He's been an introvert since he was a child. He worked in Hong Kong after he graduated. He writes to me once every two months. He's now taking the place of Ah Xin and has left Ah Xin with no choice. He's avenging his father, isn't he? Don't you know his plan for revenge? He started dating my daughter at the university. Don't you know that? Stop talking. He's the son of Fu Jiajun. For him to avenge his father is understandable. But he's too ruthless. How can this be? His name is not Fu. He goes by your name Cheng. His real name is Fu Zhen. He wants to bring harm to our whole family, right? He is my son, but his father is not Fu Jiajun. This secret has been with me for over 20 years. He doesn't know it himself. His father is Ah Xin. Hong Kong-Macau celebrity basketball match has begun. Captain of the Movie Star Team is Mr. Tsui Sap Fat. Captain of the Celebrities Team is Mr. Ho Xin who has just recuperated and doing his best for charity. Our prize presenter is Mr. Lee Tsz Hang, Mr. Choy Chun Fai, and the Chairman, Mr. Nie Aotian. All the best! -Brother. -He's the one that I'm going to greet. Mr. Ho, congratulations. Mr. Cheng. Don't think that you have many men. I've brought four boats of men. Bu Ye Din is my territory! Damn it, you try to threaten me! I grew up in Shanghai. I've seen all kinds of adversities! Bu Ye Tin is my territory. Who do you think you are that you can take what you want? How boastful! You want to fight, don't you? Who's afraid of you? Calm down! We are all here for the money, not to fight. Let's talk this out. Back then, King of Ghosts came whenever brother Xin couldn't. Now there's this bastard. He's a nobody who looks down on us. I'm the manager here. I'll be responsible. Manager? How boastful. Kid, where are you from? Can you create two Bu Ye Tian and make sure they are exactly the same? All right, let's talk this out. You think you can settle this? He married Ah Xin's daughter and then kicked his father-in-law out. I heard that Ah Xin's son was killed by him, too. Be careful, he might kill you, too. Don't worry, can he do it? What are you doing? Mr. Cheng, run! TEAM SUPERSTAR - TEAM CELEBRITY It's 17 minutes into the second half. With Mr. Ho's great skill, his team is closer to winning. That's right. Three minutes more before the end of the match. That's right. CLOSED FOR MAINTENANCE Thank you. -Come on, lift him up. -Yes! Be careful. One, two, three! Tung, what is it? Nothing. Mr. Ho, congratulations. Run! Watch out for those three guys! What are you trying to do? Mr. Ho, you're still so sharp. Ah Tung, congratulations. It's him. Don't move. You are suspected for inciting a murder. -It wasn't me. -We are arresting you. I like the feeling of victory. That's why I never lose. -What are you doing? Are you insane? -I'm sorry. There! Ah Xin! -Your mom is here. -Mom! Where did you go? Tell me what you have done to Ah Zhen. Nothing. I didn't do anything. I went to Hawaii to look for Ah Zhen's mother. Why did you go to see her? It's because of Cheng Leer. -Daddy, who's Cheng Leer? -Shut up! Ah Xin, come over here. What is it? Leer said, Ah Zhen is not the son of Fu Jiajun. He's yours. Mom, what's going on? Tell me. -How can that be? -Mom, tell me. Don't ask me anymore. -Mom. -Tian-erh. What wrong have I done? What have I done? Don't run! Why are you running after me? Aren't you here to talk? Why do you want to kill me? You know what you've done. Ah Zhen. Ho, you finally came. You killed my dad years ago and now you want to kill me, too. Come on! Come! Ah Zhen! Go away, bitch! Did you think I was really in love with you? -I was using you. I'm going to dump you! -Ah Zhen! Why are you like this? I want you bastards to suffer! Ah Zhen, you do love me! Tell me! Ah Zhen! Ah Xin. You are still putting on a show. Even crocodiles shed tears more than you! Shut up! You can revile anyone, but not Mr. Ho! Why not? Let me tell you the truth. My name is Fu Zhen. I am the son of Fu Jiajun! Ah Zhen, you are actually... No, don't tell him. Why? Mrs. Ho, calm down. You promised me on the plane. Why? What are you waiting for? Get rid of the problem forever. Kill me and no one will seek revenge from you! Ah Xin, it's a mess upstairs. Don't you know that? It's a mess here, too. Asshole, it's your retribution today. Come on, all of you. I knew it, damn you! I'll castrate you! Come out. Come. Ah Xin, why did you stop me? You're still protecting him? Ho got you into this mess. Ah Zhen is the son of Cheng Leer! Cheng Leer's son is the son of Fu Jiajun. The bastard clearly wants to come here for revenge! Bastard. I'm going to kill him! Ah Zhen is not the son of Fu Jiajun! Isn't the son of Cheng Leer the son of Fu Jiajun? Unless Cheng Leer had an affair with another man! Affair with another man? Was it you? Yes. I don't know what wrong I've done to cause incest and feud among brothers. This is the biggest loss I've suffered in this life. I've lost so much that I can't get back on my feet. Ah Xin, don't worry. You didn't lose. What are you talking about? You didn't lose. I'm so smart. I, Guo Yingnan, am really smart. What are you talking about? Tell me. I made the right bet. You didn't lose. Do you remember that Ah Mei was beaten up badly by Fu Jiajun? Yes. -She ended up paralyzed. -Yes. When she was in the hospital, the doctor said that she lost her child. I was afraid that you and Ah Mei would be sad. So, I bought a child to pretend that she was yours. That child is... Tian-erh? Right. It's her. You're not lying, right? You're really not lying, right? Why should I? For so many years, the only thing I didn't tell you was that I was infected with venereal disease at 20. I tell you everything. Why should I lie to you? All right, I believe you. Thank you. Thank you so much. I'm so happy. All right, stop crying. What a shame to cry at your age. You should stop crying, too. When you go in later, don't speak out loud. Just whisper to Ah Mei only, understand? Yes. Did you think I am that stupid? Thank you. -Mr. Ho. -It's all right now. Tell her. Ah Zhen. -I have something to tell you. -Stop wasting your breath! You look like shit. You can go. What tricks are you up to now? If not for the fact that my daughter is in love with you, I wouldn't let you off so easily. Let me go? You will regret it. I won't. I hope you won't come back again after you leave. I don't want to see you again. Ho Xin, you are stupid to let me go. Then I'll owe you one. But I will be back. -Then, they didn't commit incest? -No. Get lost! Ah Zhen! I will be back. Mom. All right, it's all right now. You are my daughter. You will always be my loving daughter. Be good, don't cry. I must tell you. What happened today was not my idea. It was that bastard Tai Tung who acted on his own will. I know you don't believe me, but I must tell you this. I believe you. I know my enemy well. You wouldn't play such dirty tricks. Thank you for thinking highly of me. Ah Gao, take Mrs. Ho and Tian-erh back. I need to talk to Master Nie. Ah Xin, what else do you want? Don't talk nonsense. Go back first. Madam, go back first. Ah Nan, close the door. Today, we must settle all our grudges. How? If we go on like this, someone is bound to get to us and we'll suffer great losses. Let's do it in this room. No one will know what happened today. What do you want to do? I have always wanted to beat you up! I'll fight you alone! Fight me? It wouldn't be a fair fight. You have no choice. Ah Nan, keep watch. No problem. You don't have to do this. All right, people in this room are used to casting votes. Who wants me to beat him up? Raise your hands. I support. You lose. But I don't want others to say that I bullied an old man. I'll let you make three moves. Come. You said it. Ah Xin! So impressive? Did you think that just because you're younger, you can bully me? Let me tell you, my leg is known to be powerful! When I was a bouncer at a theater in China, I threw out those people who came without paying! I kicked them out! They couldn't even find their teeth! It's called the King of Kicks! Here's the second kick! Wait! We said one on one! Who has time for you? Ah Xin, attack! Two against one, that's unfair! Let's beat him up together! You bloody hit my balls! Here, take this! Nothing is fair in this world. Only victory or defeat matters! So painful! No one knows who won the fight. It was rumored that after Guo Yingnan was hit in the balls, his visits to night clubs dropped from six to three times per week. After one week, Nie Aotian left the entertainment company. Miss Di, come in. Come here. Have a seat. Mrs. Ho. I must really thank you for what you've done. I'll be most willing to help Mr. Ho any way that I can. See if you like this. Mrs. Ho. Just a small token. This was supposed to be my daughter's dowry. But now... I can't accept such an expensive gift. Please accept it. Is it OK if I call you Ah Yun? No problem at all. Ah Yun, I know you like Ah Xin very much. I like you, too. Mrs. Ho. I've been paralyzed for over 20 years. Ah Xin and I are only husband and wife in name. I've been wanting to find a nice girl to live with me and be like sisters. I can even divorce Ah Xin in order to let you be the real Mrs. Ho. I wouldn't mind all this. -No, I can't let you do this. -Don't tell me you don't like Ah Xin. Although I'm a bit stupid, my eyesight is still working well. I'm too headstrong. I'm not suitable for Mr. Ho. Don't be like that. Every Hong Kong girl is headstrong. The most important thing is you love each other. You too are a celebrity. I'll ask Ah Xin to arrange the wedding grandly. I'd like to have a few words with Benny. All right, you should talk about it. Go in and find him, go. Benny. Your wife asked me to marry you. She discussed this with me. She's an open-minded person. Please return this to your wife. I don't deny that I liked you. But there are too many complications between us. There'll be trouble if we are together. You don't need to care about what others say. Of course I do. When others point their fingers at you behind your back, you'll feel the pressure. It's not the first time that I'm with a married man. I know this very clearly. So, you asked the little actor to wait for you downstairs. I've promised to get married to him. I don't have pressure being with him. Mrs. Ho is not well. But she stood by you and supported you in your most difficult times. She is the one who loves you most. I feel so ashamed in front of her. Mrs. Ho told me that she was only placed second in your heart. Don't you feel sorry for her? I'm leaving. Don't look for me again. Maybe I'll send you a card on Christmas. Benny. He's been waiting for me for a long time downstairs. How did it go? Congratulations, Mrs. Ho. You are in fact the one he loves most. Goodbye. She said she wanted to return this to you. It's all right. You don't look happy. Do you have any cigarettes? Yes. You haven't smoked for a long time. I think it's better for me to smoke. Look at how happy they are. Ah Xian, there's something I'd like to talk to you about. But I don't know how to say it. What is it? It's about our future. And our next generation. I must do it. I thought you'd never say it. You knew? How would I know if you don't tell me? I thought it was easy. But now, I realized how difficult this is. You must say yes. I need to think about it. It's really so hard to say it. Actually, it'll take only half an hour. I knew it when you took the flowers out. I want you to say it. Say it. You hold it first. Hurry and say it. I have passed my venereal disease to you. Let's go and see the doctor together. Go to hell, you bastard! What are you thinking about? -I'm thinking about someone. -Who is it? Now, I only have you in my heart. Of course, I'm thinking about you. Mr. Ho, can I have your autograph, please? Can you tell me your secret to success? However difficult it is, never give up. Thank you.
