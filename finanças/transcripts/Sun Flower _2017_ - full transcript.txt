[MUSIC] Grandma is waiting for you. Grandma hasn't got a single color photo in her life. Now that she's gone. We'd better have her leave with grace, instead of this sullen face in black and white. [MUSIC] Old Ms. Ouyang, have a good journey! Go! Bumps all over the head, bad taste for a lifetime. Nobody else's old mother has her last portrait in color. They are no match for my mother. My mother has got a great son. You call that great? Don't you see what you are wearing? Xiangyang, cry loudly! Grandma can hear you and know you hate to part with her. I won't. [SCREAM] Xiangyang, you can't take this jacket! We shouldn't keep the clothes of the dead. It has to be burned, give it to me, hurry! Xiangyang, what are you doing? What are you doing? Give it to me. You punk kid, don't you hear me? I've told you it has to be burned. Let go, kid! Xiangyang is so wild. He hasn't lived with us ever. Even if I, his stepmother can tolerate him, he won't put up with me. What are you doing, painting on the fine wall like this? I'd like Xiangyang to take this room. You're really bringing him back here? Our kid, he has to be home. Remember what you promised when we got married? Your mother would take care of the kid. My mother? My mother is gone. She can't take him with her, can she? Ther it is. Pipe down. Look, it's green. Xiangyang, come here. Hop on the bike! [CHIRPING SOUND] [CHIRPING SOUND] Grandma and Xiangyang came back home today.

Yeah! Don't show up before my eyes next time. I'll beat you up every time I see you. Xiangyang, what are you doing? Stepmothers are blackhearted. Your father has barely left and she made you a cowboy. Xiangyang, you'll suffer more in the future. If she bullies you, tell me. What are you gonna do? Huijuan, come, the flour is ready. Look at your husband, Hengyuan. He's making a decent living in town, unlike other men here. Tell me about it! In our village, the younger men go into town, the stronger ones are down the mines. But Hengyuan has his superb craft. He's quite a painter. True! You're blessed to be with Hengyuan. Blessed? I only hope not to be cursed. I heard that he took home his dead ex-wife's kid. Did he bring that kid to your house? Yes. Alas, it's hard to be a stepmother. You'll suffer in the future. That kid is motherless, and you are the stepmother. It's wrong, no matter what you do. It's fun. Come here, birdie! Come here! It's fun! It's gone. Gone. Gone. Ah. Ah. Mom! Mom! Zhang Xiangyang, sift out the flour from dirt. And it'll be your food. Did you hear me? Zhang Xiangyang, get out! Who told you to feed the flour to the chickens? You intent on going against me, aren't you? I'm back. Wife, get me something clean to wear. So you do remember to come back, huh? As a father, u idle away too much. You had a son and the forgot about it. And gave me a hard time. You stay in town day after day, just like a city boy. But your kid is gonna be the king of the family. He's torturing us to death. What happened? What happened? He stole eggs and put the shells under the pillows of the other two little ones. We have raised a thief in the family. I can't take it anymore. It's up to you now. Really? I'll give him a lesson Hello. Still asleep? Wonderful. Let's have the big bird hatch the little bird. This is no bird egg. There's a hole on top. It's called Xun [AN ANCIENT CHINESE MUSICAL INSTRUMENT] It sings. - How? - Look. Come here. Have a go! Block these holes, with your fingers. The thief is justified, huh? He's in the right then. It's ok. Come out. Zhang Hengyuan. Quit crying! What's with you? Am I deaf to you? What do you mean? By blowing that thing and singing in there? He stole things and he got a prize? You don't want to live along with me, do you? If you don't, just speak up! Friends and folks. Welcome to join Dayou Machinery! Our motherland's construction needs you. Alright, stop here. Ready for departure. Hold on. Hurry up! Hurry, hurry, hurry! We've got someone else. Turn back, father, turn back. When I gain a foothold in town, I'll pick you up and we'll have fun there. Zhang Xiangyang Headmaster The school has decided to enter you for the Caligraphy contest of the town. Practice brush writing back home The school's honor is on it. Don't you have eyes? The whole family is in your debt. You mess up with everything. What are you standing here for? He... Is he in? Who? Zhang Hengyuan Zhang Hengyuan a name you can call? Don't you know who he is to you? I'm looking for him. You're looking for him? That damned uncle of yours went to town only yesterday. Yet he is in some trouble. And called your father away. You are looking for him, go find him yourself. Boss, another two cakes. Brother-in-law, pay the money! - How much is it, boss? - 50 cents Xiangyang is back. Take off your clothes and let's wash together. How's my uncle? Your uncle? He is almost reduced to a beggar in town. Don't be like him when you grow up. Go get the towel for me. Why didn't you go to school? I fell into the river. Who took my money? If you don't confess, I'll search all of you. Come over. You, come here. Hands out, out! You scared the kids. None of your business. Xiangyang, did you take my money? Tell me if you took it. Stop asking, just search! Come over! No? How odd it is. Where's the money? No. Did I buy any alcohol? I must, must have lost it somewhere. Wife, I'm hungry, feed us! Come and eat up! He said it didn't matter to feel this pain in the winds and rains. Wipe your fears, do not fear At least we have our dreams. He said it didn't matter to feel this pain in the winds and rains. Stop your cries, don't ask why Here comes the fish Fish, fish. Are you alright? The fish are all gone. To catch fish is not that easy. You have to pay a price for whatever you do. No pain, no gain. There's no such thing as a free lunch. You have to earn your own bread. That three yuan... Fish, fish, fish! Hurry! Move and I'll paint for you. Could you paint my mom? Your mom is beautiful. Stop, stop! Stop it! Your sister is a cripple Stop, stop it! Stop, stop it! Get lost. Are you ok? My legs were born this way. I've never walked evenly. I'm making you walk evenly now. Step on my feet. From now on. You may step on my feet every day. You paint so well, just like your father. He's awesome. Snake, snake, snake! Where's Hangyuan? Where's he? He might be asleep over there. Damn it. Hangyuan didn't and must have gotten by the snake. Someone has to go check on him. Who should it be? Xiaoyong come on. You are always saying you're brave and fearless. Now you go ahead. Go, go, go! Come on! Brother Hengyuan! Zhang Hengyuan Look. I got it. Look, look, did you see? It's poisonous, best for making medicated wine. Let's go and sell it to Old Wang. Let's go. We didn't expect that he actually caught the snake. Sold it for 15 yuan and gave the bunch of us a good treat. Uncle, is the Dragon Lord his good friend? What? He said the Dragon Lord sends him fish. The Dragon Lord is indeed his friend. The Lord saved his life once. - Found him? - No Out bombing for fish in such bad weather, Hengyuan is out of his mind. His heart must be covered by lard. He is losing his life for that crippled girl. Don't talk ill of my sister. You dare touch me! I'm telling you, Liu Xiaoyong I'll get it even with you if anything happens to my brother. Stop it for god's sake. Hengyuan must have been washed away by the flood. Then what should we do? My sister is waiting for him to have the wedding. There was a massive flood that year. He clutched onto a coffin, drifted for the whole night and didn't get washed away by the waters. Hengyuan Hengyuan Hengyuan Zhang Hengyuan, get out. I say, you little painter go home quite often lately I have my kid on my mind You little painter, so upbeat and clean, take a shower after work every day. Right, he's the only one to take so many showers. Bye! Stop! You brat, stop there. I have a half left. You eat it. Ouch, ouch. Still hurts? [CRIES] Zhang Hengyuan, I wanna learn to ride the bike.

I have to go to the toilet. Zhang Hengyuan, hurry up! - I'm not done yet. Hold on. - Damn it. I can't help it. Gosh, hurry up! Hold on. Feel better now. Hey, you rascal, pooping here at the door? Stop! Freeze! Yellow, green, yellow. Don't they look good? Imagine. Isn't it nice for the birds in the trees to enjoy such views every day? Yeah, that would be nice. When you are older and taller, you'll see views from higher and farther spots. Ready? Three, two, one. Bear the mountain in your mind. Keep the water in your eyes, Its leaves decide a tree's height. Hidden legs are for birds in flight. Warm are the flowers in the sunlight, chilling feels the wind by the shadyside, lights and shadows vary a million times, yet set once you paint your sight. Go Oh, no! Come on. Hengyuan, what are you doing? Oh, aunt. Me and Xiangyang, um, are dancing the hula dance. Yeah, the hula dance. Yes. Look. What are you up to? I'm looking at something good. What's good up there? - Wanna a look? - Yes. Climb up here from there. Mind your step. Come here. Be slow. There's a bird's nest and eggs in it. How come there is a red one? Look closer Isn't it a red date? Is it a red date? It doesn't look like one when you look closer. - What is it? - Is a plum. A plum? How does it taste? Is it sweet? Where is the plum from? Right, where is the plum from? Let's look for more. Where is it from? There are many more in here. Son, this is our secret place from now on. Every time I'm away, you may come up here and look for something good. What are you doing? Why are you up there? We are getting sun and will be right down. - We also wanna... - What do you wanna do? Go into the house. You heard me. Enter! Fish begins to rot from the head. Horrible example to be up and down this way. Wife, wife, wife. Wife, is, is it fun at the bazaar? It's much less fun than what's in our home. Wife, it's ok. I'll buy a new one tomorrow. [EXPLOSION] It's so odd today. Why isn't therefish coming up? Catch it, son. It looks like rain. Go home with the fish. I'll take another look. OK. [MUSIC] What's wrong? You look so wretched. Where's your father? It's raining so heavily. Where's the fish I caught just now? - Over there. - Ok. Very good. It's still alive. There's a spirit in the fish. It spoke to me as I was coming home holding it. What did it say? It asked me to set it free, and I remembered saying yes. But how come it is still in our house now? Son, you've already set it free in your mind. Its spirit has long gone to the Dragon Lord. It's just an empty body now, useless. Go change your clothes. Don't let the cold catch you. Wow. Your bowl. [RAIN FALLING] What's the tune? What did you say? Hengyuan Hengyuan Hengyuan Xiangyang Hengyuan Hold on, hold on. Zhang Hengyuan, why are you laughing? You're not the one getting injected. Listen, take the injections and medication. Look at your dad. He tried to protect you and broke his head. Nothing can happen to you in the future. If anything comes up, it'll kill your dad. You know that? Still laughing? Brother, here you are. - Zhang Hengyuan, here you are. - Ok. Xiangnan, give these to Xiangyang and your dad. Put them in your hand. Here you are. Eat the eggs. No, I'm fine. You guys eat. I haven't eaten yet. - I haven't eaten yet. Give me a bite. - It's mine. Give me a bite. - Let your younger brother eat first. - I haven't eaten yet. I'm good. You eat it. Take a bite. - Son, do you want a new house? - Yeah. Ok, then we'll build one next year. Ok. 1.4 kg, 1.9 yuan Here's 2 yuan. Keep the change. Then I'll give you some oil. Here. Boss, how much do you make every year? Barely make the ends meet. Hey, here comes Hengyuan. Come here and take a seat. No, you guys go ahead. Come here, Hengyuan. Try your luck. No, no, no, thanks. I've quit it for many years. You guys go ahead. - Who's turn is it? - Me. Hold on, Qiangzi, take this card. Good call. Pass, pass. Qiangzi, can I ask you something? Sure. How can I make some quick money these days? Are you hunting a job? Too many kids back home. I wanna make more money. Jobs, there are always jobs. A mine is recruiting but it's very tough. Can you manage it? Of course, I don't mind toughness. Hengyuan, you don't have to take a job like this. I've got too many kids and need more money. If you see good opportunities, introduce us. Life is so difficult. [BIRDS CHIRPING] We are gonna build a new house. A new house? The three kids are like three hungry wolves, waiting to be fed forever. Forget about the new house. But I mean it. What are you planning this time? I'm planning to make more money. Then we can build a nice two-storied house. Not with bricks, but with cement, making it strong. And then you can get a perm to have that curly hairstyle. Not like the unfashionable styles nowadays. Do you really mean it? Of course. Then what are you gonna do specifically? I'll travel farther this time. And scalp something. By the way The other day Baldy was wearing sunglasses that made him look like a toad. I found them cool. I'll just scalp those sunglasses and have all the villagers here wear them. If you did, wouldn't our village become a village of toads? What's wrong with that? At least their eyes would be protected from the sunshine when they work in the farmlands. Will they really work? Absolutely. You are bluffing all day long. Then let's have something real. [MUSIC] Why? The kids each have one but not me? Everyone has a bite. Here you are. No worries, I'm saving you guys some for dinner. Son, I'm gonna be away for longer this time. Ok, now head back. Hi, Zhang, Zhang Hengyuan What's the matter? That that, that Xun thing. I can only make sounds with it, but not a tune. Keep practicing, and I'll teach you when I return. [MUSIC] - Xiangyang - Yes - Go see if your dad has sent any mail? - Ok. Uh... There you go. - Zhang Erdan - That's me Uncle, is there anything for Peng Huijuan? Peng Huijuan? No. - Xie Laosan. - That's me. Got it. - Li Rongsong. - Me. Chen Manman Me. No letter for Peng Huijuan. - Hao Liqing. - Me. Hey, there's no letter for Peng Huijuan, but there's one for Zhang Xiangyang. [MUSIC] I'm dying for this. 50 cents, it's 50 cents. Do you have the money? I don't, but smelling it is enough. Anyone of you buys me one pot of popcorn, I'll listen to him always. Really? Yes, but why bother? You don't have the money. I want a pot! [MUSIC] Where did you get the squirt gun? With whose money? My mom bought it for me. - No way, did you steal my stuff? - No. That's impossible. What's this? How did you get the money? You must have stolen it from somewhere. I'll tell my mom and she'll spank you Big brother. Big brither, let go of my little brother. Stop, stop, stop. Big brother, stop it. Stop it. Zhang Xiangyang, stop! Go away. Go away, go away! What are you doing? Give me that stick. Are you mad? Come on, get up, get up. Didn't Hengyuan send a letter the other day? Did he say when he'd be back? He said he would return soon. We're waiting for him to get in the wheat. Big brother, we have to be clear about the money. Our family can't bear the bad name of producing a thief. You got to have your hands on this. I'm on it. Thief, thief. He stole five yuan. Where did he steal it? I don't know. Look out, look out. Miss Chen, hello! Hello! I want to have a word with you. Please. [BELL SOUND] Why are you taking my pencil? Who knows if it's yours? Maybe you stole it from somebody else. Nonsense. Your uncle came to school early in the morning. The teacher now knows you're a thief. Thief, thief, thief! You three-handed thief. Fight! Fight! Come on, fatty! Come on, Fatty! Come on, Fatty! What are you all doing? Come on, fatty! Stop it. Split. Go back to your seat, everyone. What are you all doing here? Zhang Xiangyang! The feet of the ivy. The feet of the ivy. North to the school playground North to the school playground Ivy climbs all over the wall. Ivy climbs all... [SLAMS DOOR] [MAKING SOUNDS] Big brother, big brother! Huijuan? What's wrong? You look so tense. Did Xiangyang sleep at your place last night? No. No? Really? [FIRECRACKERS EXPLODING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Zhang Hengyuan Is he here? You must be Xiangyang. How do you know? When he painted my signs, he told me. His son is named Xiangyang and he left a mark on each of his signs. Now he's no longer a painter. He's down the coal mine. Wow, popcorn, popcorn! Do you know Zhang Hengyuan? - Hi. - Yes? Do you know Zhang Hengyuan? You are? Oh, he's my dad! He's gone back, probably home at this moment. You'd better hurry home too. [MUSIC] [CRYING] [SAD MUSIC]
