If I had to pick a yearbook quote, it would be, "Lonely in life, popular in death." See that girl flying up in the air? That's me, Darby Harper. My upbringing was pretty awesome at first. That's my mom. I was following in her iconic cheer footsteps. Back then, I thought I knew who I was and who I wanted to be. - Until everything came crashing down. - There's Dad. Darby! My mom and I died on the same day. One. Two… And even though I technically came back from the other side, I was never the same. What was different about me? Are you sitting down for this? I see dead people. Everywhere. And it turns out the dead, or "Deados" as I like to call them, - Excuse me. Actually needed my help. Hey. So, that's when I turned my back on the living world and decided to start my little side hustle, - counseling local spirits. - Hello. Over time, I learned that not every person who died stuck around. Only those who have some unfinished business. And this is where I come in… …as a spiritual messenger of sorts, making sure the Deados don't get stuck in a world that no longer sees them. With my assistance, these spirits were able to cross over, which is pretty beautiful. Word spread in the purgatory circuit, and my after-school job took off. Hey, how are you? There's no pay, but if dead people gratitude had monetary value, I'd be Jeff Bezos. You'd think witnessing dead people say, "Goodbye" over and over again would be my biggest burden, but it is a distant second to the torturous realm where I am forced to spend my days, high school. I can't believe you think this is a better education than homeschooling. I mean, look at them. Honey, I have a hard time getting you to come out for dinner. I mean, how else can I get you to socialize? I make, like, ten new dead friends a week. How much more social can I get? I love you. Love you too. Try to have a good day. - Hey, babe. - Hey, isn't that Capri Donahue? Honey, I just don't get why you two stopped hanging out. You were joined at the hip. Maybe y'all should reconnect. Oh, no. I lost my hard-earned smile. It truly amazes me that at the most formative time of their lives, a time that should be about self-discovery, and finding what is individual and unique about themselves, they instead choose to homogenize in groups that give them the unhealthy acceptance they so deeply crave. You're so lucky your mom let you. I was going under the knife for my deviated septum anyway, so we just thought that we'd get my boobs done at the same time. And that's why I'd rather hang out with the unliving than the unwoke. - Gross, sorry. - Hey, dude, La Croix eruption at Mount McMuffin, dude. Did I mention that I spent last Friday night discussing modern art with a woman who claimed to be Frida Kahlo's lover? Just saying. In the ecosystem of high school, I'm basically a hermit crab hiding under a reef. And I wouldn't have it any other way. That's my friend, Gary. He's a "Stayer." A Stayer is a Deado who... - Oh, my God. No way! - I know. And she said, "Fetch." - Ew. - Your jacket is really cute, by the way. Oh, thanks. It's amazing what I can do with a sewing machine and a little thread. Capri Donahue. Head phony. Ever heard of someone described as having solid character? Oh, my God. The Sweet Seventeen promo video? - I know. - Oh, I'm living for it. Well, Capri's is pure particle board. I know! Good morning, Miss Lyman. You look like a breath of fresh air. Kiss ass. Oh, Darby. Forgot you went here. Hmm. - Babe. - Jamesy! I missed you. In case you couldn't tell by that dramatic Bachelor Nation -style spin, that's Capri's boyfriend. James Harris was a band geek who had been completely invisible to Capri until... Even though he didn't make it past the blind audition round, it was enough fame for Capri to turn her chair and set her thirsty hooks in him. Good morning, newly minted junior class. - Whoo! - Welcome to biology lab. Before you get too comfortable, I've paired you up with your lab partner alphabetically by last name. Go ahead and take a seat with that person. I don't even have to look at the list. Ever since first grade, it's always... - Harper. - Harris. Uh, Miss Lyman, I need to be partnered with James because I'm trained to assist him with his learning disability. He has dyslexia. No, he doesn't. I'm sure James will manage on his own, Capri. Capri knows I'm the one person she can't get to like her. I'm the one girl in school who doesn't wanna be her, the one person who can see through her bullshit. Hi, baby. Babe, I'm at a different table. I'm not going off to war. Oh, my God. Don't even say that. All right. Let's get started. Uh, excuse me, Miss Lyman? There's an ass on my desk. Oh, I'm sorry. This is a fresh blowout. I didn't even see anyone was sitting here. Freak show. I'm sorry. She can be a little extra sometimes. Extra psychotic. - I like your Chucks. - Oh, thanks. Yeah. James is a good guy. He was actually my first crush back in sixth grade. Before I realized that romantic relationships are just a social construct people created to avoid the fact that we're all helplessly alone in this world. Mmm. I got you this time. I do. - Hmm. Boom. - Eh, nah, nah, nah, nah. Bishop to e4. Ugh, crap. That's... Yeah, that's... That would be checkmate. Mmm. And that would also be two more bucks you owe me, kid. Come on. You don't even use money. I know, I know. But I love to leave it in Linda's purse. She gets a big boost when she finds it. Treat herself to some fancy coffee drink. All right. That is pretty frigging adorable. All right, come on. Pay up. I really wish you took Venmo. I hope you have a wonderful rest of the day. Thank you, Gary. I appreciate it. I'll try. Hey, hi. Uh, you're the girl from the bleachers, right? Uh, I don't talk to clients here. Uh. Come by my office Friday night, okay? That's where I work. Work... - Oh, shit. - Are you okay? I mean, you look like you've just seen a ghost. The opposite, actually. I thought you were... Never mind. I just... I haven't seen you before. Great. You two found each other. - Alex is new, and he's gonna need… - Oh, God. Please, no. …a junior study buddy to show him the ropes. He just transferred in from a Montessori school, so all this is pretty foreign to him. Oh, okay. Yeah, I don't know if I'm the best person to do that. Sure, you are. You're an honors student, and you both seem like such... - He's thinking, "Weirdos." - Abstract thinkers. - Mmm. - Yeah. Extracurricular activities meet-and-greet starts in ten minutes. Walk Alex through it. Help him acclimatize. - That guy. Uh, we're... Yep. - Yep. Okay. So, do you have any burning questions about Frederick Douglass High I can answer in the next two minutes? Uh, that for starters. Yeah, the superintendent passed a bill allowing corporate sponsorship of cafeterias so that schools could save on the cost of lunches. Jeez. My old school didn't have this type of structure. You know, the bell telling you when and where to go, having to raise your hand to get permission to take a leak. Public school is only a few rules away from the Marines. Yeah. That's funny. So, why did you leave Montessori? I had a bit of a rough patch last year. You know, some issues, so... I feel your pain, junior class buddy. So, who do you hang with? Uh, I don't. Oh. The lone wolf. You said something earlier about your work? Oh, no. N... It was nothing. I thought you were someone else. Um, I do some social work on Friday nights. Social work? When in doubt, the truth gets people to bug off every time. Yeah. Yeah, it's for dead people. I help them pass on to the next realm. Uh... That's really cool. I'm actually into psychic mediums too. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. What are the odds? That backfired. So, uh, are you in any of these clubs? Maybe in another lifetime. At my old school, I had a Stephen King book club. Oh, uh-huh. But you know, if I'm forced to be here, which I am, I've decided I want the most public school experience ever known to man. Wow. You're quite the glass half-full guy. I mean, if you don't embrace the absurdities in life, right? It's unlivable. Mmm. Ooh, prom. I've seen that in the movies. Uh, I gotta run. Oh. Okay, uh... I-I'd love to talk to you more about the paranormal stuff. Lone wolf, Alex. - "Lone" being the key adjective there. - Right. Yeah. See you. Yeah. Mmm. That's not good. All right. Listen up, people. We got a few cheerleaders here who want to do a special presentation just for you. And action! Let's go. Hi, Cougars! I'm Capri Donahue, and this is... Taylor. Taylor, Bree, Piper and Todd. And we're here to tell all the gym classes about cheer tryouts next week. Here's a little skit we prepared. Hope you enjoy! Hi! Are you new here? Yes, I'm a freshman. And I've always dreamed of being a cheerleader, but I'm so intimidated by it. Isn't it just for shallow, hot girls? I'm so glad you asked. And the answer is, that's offensive. Cheerleaders aren't just pretty people who are happy all the time. We face the same challenges. Just like you. Really? Even you, the head cheerleader? - Yes, even me. - Yeah. But cheer allows us to be the change that we wanna see. We support female empowerment, just like Beyoncé. When one of us falls... - The sisterhood is there to catch us. - Jesus. Next week, I'll be there. Piper, at the end. But cheer keeps the world moving. Because when something gets us down... - Cheer... - Lifts us back up. Let's hear it, Cougars! Tryouts next week, show us what you can do. Tryouts next week! - Now, Piper! - "Now," what? Next week? I'll be there. - Shit. - Whoo! - Let's go, Cougars! - Whoo! My dad said I can only invite 50 people, but I was, like, "Come on, the DJ tent holds at least a hundo." Ugh! Can we get a corporate sponsor from… …the electric company or something? This is ridiculous. Give me my clothes. Why would I take your clothes? Not planning on attending a funeral. I have no problem walking up to Principal Morgan's office in my towel to discuss his zero tolerance bullying policy. Oh, my God! You're totally gaslighting me right now. You're the one who bullied me in front of the entire class this morning. You called me an ass. Technically, I called your actual ass an ass. Maybe you'll understand that more when we get to the anatomy section of bio lab. It was just a joke. No need to go crying to the principal, freak show. Ow! My ass. - Capri! - Are you okay? I'm fine. Just... I slipped. Miss Harper, thank you so much for giving us your statement. We'll be in touch if we have any follow-up questions. Miss Harper? Uh... Yeah, yes. Okay. Okay. All right, ladies. Go home, get some rest. Remember, we have grief counselors available. Seeing a dead person is a very traumatic experience which none of us are equipped for. Sorry. Something in the throat. Hey. Hey. Yeah. She was a beauty. I know you don't like talking about your mom. And I'm not trying to push you. I know Capri's death is probably a trigger. Right? No. No, really. I'm... I'm fine. Honey. I'm just tired. So... But thank you. Night. - I love you. - Love you. Wake up, bitch. Wake up! Oh, goddamn it. So it's true. You can see me. How did you even... Uh... Remember groundskeeper Gary? - Uh... - Yeah. He told me all about your little "ability." Bring me back. Darby! Bring me back. Now! Capri, I can't bring you back. I can only help you move on. Move on? No. Cheer tryouts are next week. My Sweet Seventeen is coming up in a month. I've planned it the whole year. It costs more than my sister's wedding. Denial. It's the hardest stage. Listen, I'm... …I'm really sorry you died. I truly am. But you are dead, and neither I, nor anyone else can bring you back. Holy crap! Did I do that? - Am I coming back to life? - No, dude, you're a form of energy. So, with intense focus and practice, or I guess just pure, unfiltered teenage rage, Deados can manipulate things in the real world. - "Deados?" - Yeah. Yeah, that's what I call your kind. The in-betweeners like you. Okay, but-but-but what about, um, Gary? - I mean, he died our freshman year, right? - Yeah. He's a Stayer. It means he chooses to be here. He's waiting for his wife to die so they can pass on together. Okay, cute. Um. Then, I will be a Stayer too. Yeah. I don't wanna go to some… …creepy afterlife. No, thank you. No, no. Capri, this is not where you're meant to be, so it'll be very difficult for you to be at peace here. Especially you, feeling like you're missing out on all that stupid shit you think is so important. Oh, it might be stupid shit to you, freak show, but this is the best year of my life. Everyone thinks senior year is peak, but no. Seniors have one foot out the door to college. I am at the epicenter of the ultimate high school experience. I'm not going anywhere. You literally will never be able to see yourself again. You're dead. So is all that shit you care about. Cheer championships, homecoming, your birthday. You can't experience it anymore. I'm sorry. Look, I can deliver whatever message you want to whomever. But once you make the decision to move on, you move on. Look, you can stay here tonight if you're freaked out. But I'm going to sleep because, well, I'm alive, and I have another day of living hell tomorrow. I'm sorry you died. I'm Katlyn Kelley, reporting live from Frederick Douglass High School, where yesterday, students witnessed the shocking and tragic death of their popular classmate, head cheerleader, Capricorn Donahue. I'm on TV, and I can't even enjoy it. Grieving students have been visiting this memorial for the beloved cheerleader. Could you tell us a little about what made Capri so special? She was an amazing person and such a great friend. And I'm just gonna miss her so much. I've literally never seen you before in my life. Capri was planning a big Sweet Seventeen birthday for next month. Can you tell us more about that? Yeah, she was so excited about the party. She put everything she had into planning it. Oh, guys! I'm still here... Is there anything else you would like our viewers to know about Capri? Just that she was the glue that bonded together our sisterhood. She was actually a Scorpio. Also, follow us on Instagram. Thank you. A young spark of life, gone in a flash. A cheer heard no more. Are you sure you wanna do this? Maybe you should stay at home. Signing off. Nah, it's just putting off the inevitable. That's the photo you brought to my shrine? Taylor, you look adorable, and my eyes are literally closed! Did you guys see that? That practice killed me. Capri would have been so proud. Nationals, here we come! So, where are we going tonight? I just can't believe that she's gone. I had my nose modeled after hers. I heard she shot 50 feet in the air, and her pants flew off. Do you think James Harris will rejoin jazz band now? "Dead Cheerleader" is a killer name for a band. Alive Capricorn Donahue was an "it girl," but dead Capri Donahue? Oh, she's a legend, honey. Hey, here she is... Hey, Darby. My buddy, Mel. - Hi. - He passed last night. - Uh, heart attack. - Yeah. - Oh. Sorry. - You know. So if you don't mind, he's gonna sit and watch our lunchtime chess games - until you can help him move on. - Yeah, sure. My wife, Deb, uh, she passed 17 years ago, and you know, that's a long time. I was in a lot better shape then, right? Uh, what if she's not - attracted to me anymore? - Maybe. Well, I like to think that when you pass on, you pass as your optimal self. And I'm pretty sure that has nothing to do with your superficial exterior. Oh, my optimal self? - Yeah. - I like that. Okay. - Well, we'll talk soon. - Way to be, Darby. Thank you. - She is good! - I told you, huh? Oh, no. Oh, thank God. - Hola! Oh! - Oh! Jeez... - God, you scared the shit out of me. - Oh. Sorry. Are you okay? Yeah, fine. I... It's just someone I'm trying to avoid. Oh. Got a little stalker? Potentially. Oh, you're serious. Oh, my bad. Okay. Uh… You wanna talk about it? Well, the frustrating thing is, is I don't think anyone would understand. Mmm. I get that. Don't have to explain anything to me, I'm just making sure you're okay. Thanks. - Um... - So, what's up? So, you were there with the cheerleader yesterday? That's pretty intense. Yeah. Whoo! Sorry, Alex. Too much caffeine. Uh, sorry. Uh, I... I gotta go but I'll s... Thanks for the... Just thanks. - I need to talk to you. - Okay. I don't work at school, Capri. What do you mean, "Work"? I'm not asking you to do my taxes. Okay, what do you want? I have decided that I do, in fact, want to move on. It's incredibly boring being here and being invisible. Also, apparently, I'm stuck in this outfit. If I knew I was gonna die, I would've worn way more accessories. Smart decision. Come see me Friday night. Whoa! I haven't told you when I wanna move on. Okay, I don't have time for this. It'll be next month. After my Sweet Seventeen. No. No, just go to your funeral. Yeah, everyone will be crying and talking about how awesome you were. You'll love it. Ew, no. I hate funerals, they're mad depressing. I want the party. Which is where you come in. You're gonna make sure the party still happens. I think that curling iron incident fried your last remaining brain cell. I... Game on. Ideally, you'll do this voluntarily. But I've been practicing the whole manipulation of objects thing all morning. So, I can make life very weird for you if it comes down to it. Psycho. I just wanted to let you know. - Sorry I'm late. - That's okay, Darby. As I was saying, James will not be in today. For obvious reasons. Bree, Taylor, Piper, my condolences. I know you girls were very close. She really would've wanted us to be here today. To remember her with everyone else. That's true. I mean, they're no good to me crying in private. All right. Let's get started. If you uncover the tray in front of you, you'll find today's project. - Ugh. - Gross! - Cool! - I'm reporting this to PETA. I'm sorry, buddy. Um, Darby, I wanted to see if you wouldn't mind dropping off James's lab homework for him until he's back. Oh. Uh, I don't really think that'd be approp... - What? Say yes! - Yes, of course. Oh, my God. Capri's Sweet Seventeen promo video has over, like, 200,000 views. - Really? - Yeah. They played it on the news. It's so tragic that it's canceled. Darby! Don't ignore me. Hey! I'm serious. - Hmm. - What are you doing? Stop. - Help me get the party back on. - No. - Stop it. - Darby, is everything okay? Yes, fine. - Ew. Gross! - Oh, my God. - What the f... - Oh... I'm... Sorry, my hand slipped. Haven't you done enough? Excuse me. I don't feel well. - My God. - What just happened? - Okay, class. Carry on. - Oh, my God. What a freak. - Clearly, she needs therapy. - Hmm. What the hell are you doing to me? - Just say you'll help me. - No. What are you... No! No! No, no, no, no! No! No, no! - Sorry, I just really have to pee. - Mm-hmm. - No. What are you... No! - It's just till the party's back on. No way in hell! Stop. No. Capri! Stop, stop! No, no, no, no! A public toilet? I could've contracted any number of deadly diseases. This is criminal bullying. I think it's criminally good haunting. Fine. You know what? Have at it. I'll just keep ignoring you until I'm committed to a psych ward. Or you could help me and be free in a month. All I want is to go to this party. To see my friends having fun, and to dance next to James one last time. And then I'll move on. - I promise. - And in what worldly dimension do you think I can throw your dream party? Me, the girl you call, "Freak show"? In a world where I make you popular enough to do it. I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. Being popular is an illusion. Like a magic trick, or cryptocurrency. You just have to believe in it. And then they will too. First, you'll need to get close to Taylor and Bree, so you can convince them to throw the party in my honor. Yeah, that sounds attainable, since they hate me with the passion of a thousand suns. Excuse me. You won't be able to avoid them once you join cheer. Never. Aw, look at us little nuggets in our cheesy matching uniforms. Hey, get outta there. I forgot we were even friends that summer. Then you were all weird when we got back to school. Oh, sorry. I was just going through a little thing called my mom died. Your mom was so boss. Top of the pyramid at the '93 Nationals. Did she come to you too after she died? Get out. Okay! Touchy subject. But don't you think that she'd want you to be like she was in that picture? Happy? Smiling? Do you even have teeth? You're really blowing your pitch, Capri. Well, I just don't understand why you wouldn't wanna be, at the very least, normal. Well, I'm not normal. I've spent my childhood being a travel agent for dead people. Okay, and? We all have baggage. Yeah, like getting zits and wondering if anyone will ask you to prom. Deep. You're the most judgmental and self-righteous person I've ever met. What? No, I'm not. Okay, then prove it. If you really don't care what people think about you, then what does it matter if you hang out with the popular crew for a month or less, even? So, as soon as the party is back on, do you promise to leave? Do I have your word you'll leave after the party? Okay, yes. I promise. Cross my heart and hope to die. Again. Okay, fine. Yes! The first order of business is a full head-to-toe glow up. Hey. - What's wrong with this? - It's a lot of black, Darbs. No. My God. Burn that. What's all this stuff? My mom's old clothes from the '90s. Retro. I dig it! Darby, stop it. Ooh, it's a two-piece suit. Oh, it's a suit. Darby. Stay still. Nope. No. Congratulations. You actually look kind of hot! You need to post a selfie. To what? What are you, an alien? Or Amish or something? - I found out to be popular… - Here. …you need to post a lot of selfies. Hold it. Find your angles. - You've never taken... - What is... What's my angle? Some selfies should be silly. And you should test out every filter until your eyes lose all perspective, and you pick one where it looks like you have jaundice. Using too many emojis comes off as desperate and thirsty. But three carefully curated emojis, radiates sophistication and class. Eggplants? Penises. Kitty cats? Vaginas. And a peach is a butt. Well that certainly changes the meaning of that text I sent my grandma this morning. Just keep the captions simple. Two hours and 88 photos later, I had six usable selfies posted to my feed. If you don't embarrass yourself on Instagram, maybe I'll train you on TikTok. Don't... Don't do that. I can imagine James trying to block the party, thinking the girls are only doing it for followers. - So you'll have to get him on board, okay? - I'll try. Here it is. Aw, the tree house of love. That was our favorite make-out spot. Barf. Oh, Mrs. Harris? Hi, it's Darby. I brought James's homework. Oh, go right on up. He hasn't left his room all day. Darby? Jamesy. Hi, Jamesy... I mean, James. I brought your homework. You look different. Yeah, yeah. My cousin just started cosmetology school - and needed a guinea pig. - Nice. Natural liar. - I love you. - Sorry, it's such a mess in here. - Just let me clean it up. - Oh. No worries. He listens to oldies. Isn't it adorable? I'm really sorry about Capri. I know she loved you a lot. Didn't you hate each other? Hmm. Love-hate. We were close when we were younger. And we still talk, sometimes. Uh, talked, sometimes. Oh. Right, I didn't realize that. It's so weird, like I... I know she's gone, but it still feels like she's here with me. I mean, she was the most kind, selfless person I've ever met. Really? I mean, really. Yeah. I totally get that. And when I didn't make it past the blinds on The Voice … …I felt like such a loser. But when I came back to school, Capri helped me realize that failures are just life's way of making you stronger. It's true. I was so supportive. I'm sorry. I'm rambling. No. It's okay, really. I get it. My mom died when I was seven. Yeah, I remember. Can't even imagine how hard that's gotta be. Yeah. It's just so disorienting, like, one day your whole world is flipped upside down and it feels like you're on Mars or something, and you don't know how to feel normal again. Yeah. That's totally how it feels. Uh, I should go. Look, thank you for bringing that over. It was nice to actually talk to someone. Hey, Darby. Death has a funny way of teaching you what's most important. Like finally making that apology. Encouraging your child to embrace who they are. And the one that always gets me, that final, "I love you." The Deados never asked for anything petty or superficial… …until now. Whoa! Good morning, sweetheart. Morning. Don't make it a thing, okay? It's just a temporary experiment for social studies. - It's just... - What? You look like your mom. Okay, this is weird. What is happening? Who is that? I want her butt. Damn, smoke show. You got steez. Who is that? Is that Darby Harper? - What is everyone looking at? - You, dummy. Shoulders back, head up, walk. Who's the new chick? That's head-to-toe vintage. Who's that girl? I don't know. But she's serving '90s realness, and I'm so here for it. - Don't scowl, smile a little. - They like you. Let them in. Okay, don't smile. Um, try pouty. Cute pouty. How? - God, she is fire. - Super fresh. Is she wearing a couch cover? Hey. Darby? You look different. I mean a good different. I mean, you always look great. - You wanna have a seat? - Yeah. No. - Um... - Darby, no. Absolutely not. Is she trying to sit with the new guy? No. Uh, no. - Stupid chair. Come on. - No. You know, I'll just stand. Yeah, it's better for digestion. Hey, hey, new girl. You wanna come, uh, eat lunch with us? That's Todd. He's the cutest guy in the cheer squad. - You should definitely sit with us. - No. Oh. No, what? No, I forgot that I have something to get from my locker. No time for lunch. Darby! Hey, Darby! - What? - What are you doing? Go sit at Todd's table. Don't be such a weirdo. Well, I am a weirdo. My anonymity was my only means of survival in this place. - I'm done. - No. We have a deal. Oh, right. Your brilliant plan. Hey. - What are you doing? - You wanna know what I was thinking? Even though you hate me, I could sit at your table at lunch, join cheer and we could all become besties. Have you gone fully mental? What? You don't wanna be my friend just 'cause I got a new haircut and some lip gloss? Oh, my God. There, I tried. Your new style is hideous. You wouldn't know real fashion if it bit you on the tit. I thought it was cool. - I like her socks. - Guys. What the hell was that back there? You have zero chill. You need to get your shit together. I'm crawling back into my hermit shell tomorrow. Why are you such a defeatist? Oh, Darby, what are you doing? - You've just left your king wide open. - Defeatist is right. This is like watching The Queen's Gambit. Except she sucks. - Hey, hey. Darby, girl. - Burn. Why don't you just do the cheer thing? You know you want to. It'll be good, you'll meet new friends. Ones with pulses. Yeah. And if you follow my plan, then you'll earn their respect organically. And if I refuse? - Oh... Oh, my... - Whoa! Bitch, was that a frog? What the hell! I've been saving him since science class. I am not giving up on my party, Darby. There's more where that came from. Damn it! Fine! Fine. But this is a hostage situation, and that is on your karma report card, not mine. Cheer tryouts are less than a week away. We're training every day during lunch and after school. Hey! Your days of chess and donuts, over. Donuts. I will miss them. Hmm. Four. You gonna do anything? Excuse me? Eight. Nine. Three. Five. Seven. Again. Everything okay? Yeah, just need a sec to focus. I haven't done this since, well, you know, since my mom. - Hey, fresh homework. - Thanks. No problem. What's up? Did you hurt your ankle? It's fine. It's nothing, I just... I don't like the beach. You're gonna kill it at tryouts tomorrow. You're the best tumbler I've ever seen, and I've been to Nationals, twice. Why did you quit when we were younger? You're honestly a natural, just like she was. I don't wanna talk about my mother. Why? You know, I used to wish I had your mom instead of mine. At least your mom waited till she was dead to ignore you. Sometimes I think she might have stayed. But if she did, then why... Forget it. If she had stayed, then why what? I don't wanna talk about my mom, okay? Okay. Do you wanna scream about her instead? What? I said, do you want to scream about her? Cut it out. No. I think you'll feel a lot better if you just scream a little bit! Stop. Come on! Stop. Are we gonna make the team tomorrow, Darby Harper? Yes. I said, are we gonna make the team tomorrow? Yes! Yes! Okay? - Yes! - Yes! Okay! That's what I'm talking about! I'm gonna make the team! You're gonna make the team! All right. For those of you who don't know who I am, I am Coach Paula. You gotta be kidding me. And we have some very exciting news. So, without further ado, he's your mascot and mine… …Douglas The Donut! - Look at this guy. - Come on. Oh, my God! So cute. Go, Dougie! Oh, wow. Time to rumble, time to go nuts! - Time to cheer for the Fighting Donuts! - She's pretty good. - Oh. - Oh, nice try. Let me see it. Show 'em your moneymaker, Darbs. Yay! Suck on that, Taylor! - Yeah. - So good. You slayed that shit. I'm so proud of you. How does it feel? I actually forgot how empowering it feels. It's such a high. I feel like I have lockjaw from forcing a smile for an hour. Great job out there. No way. You... You know the donut? Yeah, I never would've thought cheering was your thing. - You're full of surprises. - I'm full of surprises? You weren't kidding when you said you were gonna find the most ridiculous activity. Well, it counts as a gym class credit. I get a free dozen donuts every game. And, come on, the outfit is sexy as hell. No, no, no, no. You cannot be friends with the donut. This is social suicide. Uh, so... Uh, update on your stalker situation? - It's ongoing. - Ooh. Sorry to hear that. Step away from the donut. I'll talk to you later. Okay, Alex? Okay. I mean, that new cheer girl's just sick on the mat. And cute. She's not new. That's Darby Harper. And she's, like, a witch or something. Yeah. She basically killed Capri. Thank you for your patience. If I call out your name, welcome to the Fighting Donuts cheer team. You made it. Yes! I knew you could do it. God, I haven't felt this alive since... Well, since I was alive. Darby Harper, is that a smile on your face? Congrats on making the team, Darbs. See you on the field. - Say thanks, weirdo. - Thanks, weirdo, you. - How does he know I made the team? - Probably posted it to IG. Check. Okay! Look at you with 756 followers. Congrats, you're actually becoming a real person. Now, repost it to your story. And, um, humble brag. Pretend like you don't actually care. Uh, I don't really care. Perfect! God, you're so good at that. I actually did care. I'd finally started making it in the living world, but it turns out there are a lot of rules to being popular. Don't brag, only humble brag. It's okay to be moody, but never sad. Sad is cringe. Don't try too hard. Be woke, but not a woke fisher. Don't be thirsty. Do listen. Do smile. Speak clearly. Don't be angry. Be a winner. Don't worry. Dress to impress. Don't overgram. I prefer the Deados any day. Sure, they're dead, but at least they don't play games. The admiration and envy hang so heavily in the air, even a dead girl can smell its sweet musk. Hey, hey, Darby! - Ah! Ah, ah. - I'll check you later. - But I have chess with Gary. - Mm-mmm. Not today, you don't. Sit. Full set. Unbelievable. Yeah. Cool. Say hi. Jesus Christ, I
