Before World War I, a Danish politician delivered a speech. He stated: "Besides the sex drive, the railway is the most unruly device in Denmark." Now the railway drift has become normal. "Love" I, A LOVER (Freely adapted from the novel by Stig Holm) "I, a Woman" "I, a Man" "Eva, the Great Suksex" "The Odyssey" "The Bed Horse" "Is Pornography Harmful?" I've been caught. - What did you say? - I said I was caught. You haven't been interested in sex for 2 weeks. So now it's happened. You are impressively... ...impotent. Good morning, Isak. This is Beatrice. I'm going to leave Peter. I leave my husband, I said. Yes, and go to Paris with you. Yes, I'm ready this afternoon. I just pack the bare necessities. Peter will send the rest down to you. Will you pick me up at 2pm then? Fine. See you, darling. Who was it you called darling? Isak. Who is Isak? Isak Anderson. The junior manager at my work. You know that. Well, he who has that nice sports car. Typical. After five years of marriage your wife leaves you for another man. And the only thing that interests you, is his sports car. Well that's because it's an unusually special car. Really? What? That you leave me? Yes. Why? I've told you. Because you are impotent. And it can't be due to overwork only. Would it be evening, and I had pomade in my hair - - I could emotionally say: "Beatrice, please don't leave me." But at seven o'clock in the morning - - unkempt, unshaven and sleepy. - Come on shut up. Shouldn't you get dressed and go to the office? I should stay home today, since you leave me. Was it at 2pm? No, don't be sentimental. Dress now and go to the office. And when you come home I'll be gone. Oh! That people can read stuff like this. That it can be printed - and booksellers dare to sell it. Ugh! That people actually buy such stuff. You may well say so. And they are expensive. I have given 24,50. And you? It's not that bad but these three here, they are really hot. But they are also tougher. I must loan them when you are finished. Yes, but I want them back. Really. Especially the one with... where... Where they... What imagination people have. Hello? This is Flossie... Mortensen. No, Mr Isl?v hasn't arrived yet. We expect him every moment. Goodbye. Good morning. Good morning. Anything happened? What are you reading? Shh. Don't people think about anything else? You should probably ask that. People have too much time. That's a disadvantage with the welfare state. They've got sex obsessed. They think of nothing else, speak nothing else, don't read about other issues. Where did we stop? You didn't want to lie with me in the last 14 days. Now it's happened. Hello, Mrs. Beatrice. Hello. Is our man home? He's in the office. That's why I came. Director Schmidt. I was asked to deliver some papers. May I sneak in? Just a second, because I must go. Every little while with you is a pleasure. I have some papers here your husband has asked me for. Thank you. Are you going on vacation? Why not? Your husband needs to make some accounts ready. Yes, accountants are busy. Overtime and all that, but... You can take it easy. My husband isn't travelling. Oh, you're going on vacation alone. Yes. Why don't you take me? You know I love you, don't you? We could have such a wonderful time together on a holiday. I'm not interested. I'm a marvelous lover. Just ask my wife. Does she advertise your erotic skills? If you ask her. Mr. Schmidt is too modern for me. Both you and your wife. If I'd only understand, what you want with your husband. Not to say anything derogatory, but he's not good in bed. This isn't to insult you. It just can't be kept secret. I leave Peter and travel to Paris with one another man. Why the hell is it not me? Now she travels. In about five minutes he'll come and pick her up. God knows whether you're using his sports car? Should I call and wish a good trip? No, no. I'm not going to be an idiot. I'm off now. I go home. I'm not feeling good. What do you mean? In the middle of our busiest period? Where all of our clients must have closed accounts? It's not possible. Shall the entire workload be passed on to us? You're not busy today. What do you mean by that? Do you think we read all these filthy books for our... ... pleasure, or what? Mr. Mortensen and I are intellectuals. We must be oriented. To follow the debate. I must at least have fresh air. It will get around. Isak knows a lot of people. And all Beatrice's girlfriends. She ran away, because Peter is impotent. And although it's damn bollocks, so... I can't show up anywhere. My friends will laugh. Her girlfriends will despise me. It... Everything is OK. The gun is loaded. Remember, you'll get your fee. But it will be from "Stag's Leap". - Why shall I be excluded? - Maybe due to bad breath. Use Kolbj?rn's toothpaste with active bladan. It makes yellow teeth green. Don't worry. He has control over the situation. And he has control over his hair. Do as the man at the centre. - Gets a lion in the tank. - Put a 10' in the bank. National Savings Policy. Impotent, she said. And so she travelled. It's just a lie. Here I stand and get more potent for every second. But just because you're tired and over worked... It is the most important thing in the world is eroticism. Just because Beatrice left... Just because... You've a hot end? Can I borrow your glow? Yes, you'd better try yourself. Thank you. Thank you. Are you satisfied with just looking at the pictures? Won't you spend a hundred for real erotic entertainment? A hundred crowns? Taxes included. I may not go cheaper for my union. Well, what do you think? Yes, many thanks. Where do you live? Just around the corner. Then you save the taxi. We must be quiet. The janitor has children. How many? Shh. Throw your coat. Yes thanks. Payment in advance. You don't mind, do you? What about a 50 extra? Then we've plenty of time. And you'll get exactly what you want. Oh, you're sweet. I give a beer. Of course you won't pay extra for it. Hof or Tuborg? It doesn't matter. I can' taste the difference anyway. Here you are. Boring, eh? I haven't read it. It should be banned. Do you say that? Yes, I guess. I think it's rude. I haven't bought the book. It's a gentleman who comes here. I must read aloud to him. It's to puke over. Well, cheers and let's forget this. Well, we should get down to our business. No! Don't you want you anyway? Yes, but... But what? How would you like ti, baby? Come on, just say it. You're a little shy, eh? Yes. Yes, that's okay. Will... would you have a hat? A hat? Is this one good enough? Yes. Come on, hurry up. My wife and daughter shall not wait for you. What do you mean? You shall accompany our trip. It's Saturday. The sun is shining. You have free. You're alone. How do you know? I was here yesterday right before Beatrice left. Haven't you received my attachments? She put them on your desktop. Can't you turn down a little? Why shall he join us? He's father's accountant, right? But why should he join? He says that his wife has left him. Because he's impotent? Who said that? Dad. He believes in fact that all other men are impotent, just not him. Just turn it on again. I don't want. You must help a friend in a crisis. But I'm not complaining. She'll certainly return. What have you told your wife? That you have marital trouble. I dislike it. Don't be so ungrateful now. Turn it down. May I introduce Peter Isl?v? It's my wife and my daughter. hello . My name is Sigrid. May I suggest we be on a first-name basis?. Thank you. My name is Peter. Lolly, but my real name is Elizabeth. Elizabeth with a Z, not S. All right. Turn down the damn radio! This kind of music must be played loud. What did we talk about? I can't remember. I don't think a marriage can last, - if the man can't satisfy the woman bed. What do you say, Sigrid? Come on. Have you been in... the royal, Peter? The coffee's ready! Thanks! Dim the radio; hell! All the way! As I said before. A marriage without eroticism doesn't make sense. Obviously, I'm still hot on my wife. Turn off that damn radio! If I may not listen to the radio, I'll go to bed. Good night. Not too much water. Not too much water. You must admit that if a man can't do it properly... Well, never mind, my old. Cheers. Do you visit art exhibitions frequently? Now don't interrupt. There must be other things binding. Besides the sexual. Of course there are. But if a man can't do that certain thing - then it's no wonder that his wife escapes. Quiet, Ole. Be quiet. Well, you may excuse me. Absolutely okay. I don't feel hurt. Thunder at this time of the year? Come on, Putte. Lets go to to bed. She get's really wild in thunderstorms. You can find out for yourself where you live, okay? First door to the right. I get so scared when it thunders. Should you go to your parents? No, it's not possible. Why not? They use to fuck all night. May I join you? Well... But I'm cold. I must surely come. You're not impotent, right? I think it has stopped to thunder. Hold on me, I'm so scared. It goes over with Beatrice. You know everything, eh? With whom did she escape? Isak. Isak Anderson, Anderson & Co. Him with the Porsche? Yes. But then it was therefore. You think so? Yes, that was the reason. Hold me closer. Don't be afraid. I am 16. It isn't criminal. I have a friend who's 17 and his name is Johnny. He calls me Gwendolyn. His real name is Hasse - but Gwendolyn and Johnny sounds much better. But you're neither named Gwendolyn or Lolly, but with Elizabeth with Z. Can you really remember that? You may kiss me. I'm an older man. You're only 16. Actually I do know it all with Johnny. Do you? Not everything, but... But what? What they do in America. What are they doing in America? You don't that? Like this they do in America. Do you like it? They have such a sweet word for it. Petting. They call it petting. isn't it romantic? A small greeting from Paris. We live in a marvelous hotel. See the photograph on the front. We have a wonderful time. Isak asks me greet you. Sorry, I left you. Love Beatrice. Lolly told everything. Everything? Everything. Well it wasn't that much. She's just afraid of thunderstorms, and I'm too. A little. It... was almost a game. She told what she did with you. What did you do with her? She said she enjoyed it, and you enjoyed it immensely. Are you sitting and enjoying it again? Just by remembering it? No, don't cry. There was nothing. I mean... Nothing serious. It was just a thunderstorm, and so she was comforted. Imagine that you enjoyed it so. Is it very bad that I enjoyed it? You don't understand. You enjoyed it. With my daughter at 16... I'm old. What nonsense. You're not old. Some nice knees, you have. Is this all you have to say? I can't see anything more of you. How clever you are, Peter. More clever than I thought. Am I? I actually get scared of being alone with you. Oh, come on. But it's true. I think I need a little mood drink. Won't you offer me a drink? Jo... Yes, sorry. One moment. One moment. Well. What do you say now? To check even more of me... Where's the bedroom? I can't. Yes, really. What do you mean? What I'm saying. You can only with 16-year-olds? - That was not what I meant. may I have my beer? Yes. Now I'll get a glass. No, you don't need. Shouldn't you do something? I feel so stupid. I don't remember how to do it. You could for example begin by taking your clothes off. Yes, of course. Your wife smells good. What was her name? Beatrice. Beatrice, what a beautiful name. What now? You said you couldn't do it the ordinary way. Yes, I think I can with you. Is it there, your wife is? Yes. I have to leave now. Sigrid! No, no more now. When will you come back? Who says I'll come again? But... Don't forget that I love my husband. Do you? Of course I do. But what he said about you wasn't right. What a pity I can't tell it. Well if you love him why did you do it? Most women are curious. Goodbye, Peter. Thank you for today. It can't be true. I'd better stamp it through. It doesn't work. So. 435, it is 36, 37. . Hello? Is it Mr Eversen? I sit here with your accounts. Yes, it's written here eight months. Congratulations, congratulations. I'll send a sponge cake. Goodbye. Hey hey. Hello, Peter. Hello. Don't you like I come? No, but... I had to do it. Mom told me everything. Isn't it wonderful? Well, I don't know. It seemed she was in any case. She thinks I'm jealous now. Isn't it funny? I'm not jealous at all. I love you. And I'll kiss you now, here. Hey hey. It... It... It was my niece. I'm her favorite uncle. We haven't met for many years. Goodbye. Are you still married to Ole? Yes. You never know nowadays. Nylon or crepe? Transparent. Dark. Dark? Yes, preferable black. If you have. We do have. Who will go with that? I'd also like to know that. Yes, they are excellent. Yes, and what size? Peter Isl?v. What have you bought at La France? Have you started to wear lingerie? No, I haven't. Did you see me? Maybe you also buy there? No, I really don't. Some of us have come a little longer. What did you buy, Peter? I must know it. I tell you if you come here. Who says it's for you? If you don't say it, you'll never see me again. At least not tonight. I'll meet with a friend. I'm waiting for her now. Say it now, then you're sweet. Only if you come. Hello? Peter? I'm drunk. Tuesday is my womans-night and we usually go to a bar together. But she didn't come tonight. I have been betrayed. A defenseless woman at a bar. I'll pick you up. Where are you? At a bar, I told you. No, I'm not saying where it is. No, you may not get me. Listen, Sigrid, you can't sit at a bar alone. I'm not alone. Here sits a wonderful gentleman - who constantly tries to fill my glass. Are you worried for me, little Peter? Really serious? Gee, so maybe, I come anyway. May I pay? No, no. But I have invited you. But it's me who pays. Actually I am a respectable wife - and certainly not what you think. If you knew how I have been nervous. What was it that you bought at La France this afternoon? I don't tell it. Well, so leave again. What did you purchase? A gift. To whom? For you, maybe. Why only maybe? It depends on whether you wear it. May I see what it is? Grab. It is obcsene. It's rude. It's pornographic. Should it be a gift to me? Should I take it? What molestation. Uh... Sigrid! Sigrid! Uh... Sigrid? But it wasn't to offend you. Sigrid! I'll just call home to my husband. Hello, darling. No, I took Ulla with me home. It was so boring so we thought it was better - we went home to her. Well, just now I feel wonderful. How are you? Sorry, there must be something wrong with the connection. Yes, now it's better. No, Ole, there isn't anything wrong. I'll stay here tonight... I think. No, honey. I've just smoked too many cigarettes. Therefore, I'm a little breathless. No, not more, Ole. Not anymore. Goodnight, honey. Sigrid! Sigrid! What the hell do you imagine? Oh thank you, my fine friend Such plays we're not joining. You should have a good spank! Really! And right now! I thought you were my friend. And invited you at a weekend. Presenting you to my wife. And what do you do? I've done something wrong. Wrong? It's obscene! Mean! Abused my friendship, my trust. Where are the accounts? Your accounts? Yes, the bank get's nervous. The Companies Register revolts because of your damned carelessness. I'll fix it immediately. I'm actually near finished. You said that also last week. Don't give up. You stay away from the office without any apologies. It doesn't work. You must pull yourself together. Listen. Let's talk together man to man. You are impotent. It was therefore, Beatrice ran away. But you know, it isn't certain that it has... physical causes. Don't you think so? Usually it's psychological causes. So you should talk to a doctor. Or preferably a psychologist. Been here before? No. Sexual or social counseling? Sexual. It's Mrs Pauce. What about Mr Pauce? He's not good at that. You've been married for nine years and you have nine children? With your husband? Yes, some of them. Nine children in nine years and you want sexual guidance. Why? Therefore. Sit down. Thank you. So you believe that you can read up to that? Yes, there can't be any harm in trying. Goodbye. Next please. Hello. Go ahead. It has become a problem for me. What's the problem? Well, you see, my husband has got a car, and... What and? - We do it in the back seat. We drive around every night and find a deserted road, and then... we're never home anymore. And you don't like it? No, I think it's wonderful making it in the car. But so what? At the end of the month my husband has no more money for fuel. This isn't a sexual but a social problem. It's my husband's. Thorbjorn? I have a lady who subordinates to you. No, is it true? Is there someone who has a social problem? Please come inside. Take of your coat. Next please. Please go in before me. I can't accept that. I'd rather wait. Not talking about. - Please do it. Push me aside. Track at me, humiliate me. Go first in. Just do it, she enjoys it. She's a masochist. Please come closer. Take a seat please. No, it's the chair over there. Well. Your name is Peter Isl?v and you are accountant. What can I do for you? It's hard to say. It isn't so easy to... Spit it out, or I can't help you. You are probably impotent. No, no. Quite the contrary. How can that be understood? After my wife has left I've become more than erotic. How does it show? Yes, although I'm with several women and many times a day - it isn't enough. I just get more erotic. Everything I see makes me think about it and only it. The sight of all round, soft, shiny objects makes me sexually excited. When I see a girl on a bicycle, it seems she does something entirely different. Every woman I look at I undress with my eyes. Continue. What more can I tell? I can't concentrate on my work. Even those numbers in the books become pornographic objects. No matter who I talk to, it's about sex and porn. Sorry. Cand. psych. Ulla Pauce. No, Pauce. P as in penis, A as in anus, U as in uterus, C as in coitus and E as in erotic. Yes, Pauce. Just a moment. Do you leave? Yes, you can't help me. You're thinking of nothing else either. Good morning, ma'am. Good morning, Mr. You don't regret that you left him? No, Darling. You don't regret that you came with me? My little putt, putt, putt. Self putt, putt, putt. Here you are, lady and gentleman. Coffee, my dear. Coffee. This is for you. For me? Oh no, this is too much. What is it? Listen: "Dear Mrs. Beatrice. Enjoy your holiday and don't worry about your husband. He's best suited to have many girls. Marriage isn't for him - so you did a good deed, when you left him. He's a wonderful lover, but I have to share him with others. Hope that him you have now, is more monogamous. Sincerely, Your unknown friend S." What do you give me? He has written it. Don't you think I know his handwriting? Read yourself. You said he's impotent. When he's with me. The villain, the gangster. You don't care about him. Why are you so angry? Don't you understand? It's an insult for me as a woman. No. Oh, men are stupid. It's an excellent letter. What's so fantastic? Now you can get divorced any time. Divorced? Now he has been unfaithful to you. We just try to find out who wrote that letter. Is it you? Well... Don't say more. I know mom comes, but I must speak with you before. Okay, come in. How pretty you are tonight. It's the first time I see you in a dress. You also look good with jeans. It's not what I mean. Don't say more. Don't make it harder for us. May I call you Chris? What? It would make it easier for me if I may call you Chris. Well then call me Chris. Thank you. Please sit down, Chris. Thank you. Go ahead. May I sit like that? I'm expecting some guests. I know that, but it must be a beautiful farewell. Farewell? I know you love me. But I must sacrifice myself for mom. I'm not going to take you from her. Although I could, actually? It would feel like betrayal against mom if you gave agreed with me. But she's old. What ? She's over 36. What do you mean? 36 years, that's a wonderful age. She really loves you, Chris. don't betray her. Don't let my sacrifice be in vain. Farewell, my beloved. Bag. Thanks, Chris. Chris? I've seen the underwear you gave to mom. May I get a garter belt? Garter belt? Not garters, but a real garter belt, sitting here. You probably know where to get them. Will you give them to me as a parting gift? I'll figure it out. Chris, you're an angel. Ciao ciao. Ciao. Is it nice enough? Yes. Can you help me? Will you marry me? But Peter, come on. Well I mean it seriously. I love you. I thought you loved Lolly. Yes, I do too. But she has just made a sacrifice. A sacrifice? She will never meet anymore. She won't take me from you. That was certainly nice of her. You won't marry me? No, because you love Beatrice. And I love my husband. I'm confused about it. There they are. Can you open? Who's coming? Two good friends. You wanted that we invite someone. Old friend, old friend. God, is it you? It's my little friend. It's him who is too potent. Glad to make your acquaintance. Can't you take care of the tamtam? It's your business. Old friend, please take the tamtam, okay? Good evening. This is long ago. I missed you so. Old friend, it's wonderful to meet you. Fie! Of love for you. Who lives here? I do. Tell me, isn't Ole coming? No, not until tomorrow. Old friend, shall we have a taste of the tamtam? Here you are. It is real apple brandy. Homemade. It should be emptied tonight. Otherwise it goes in compound with the plastic. And you can die from that. Cheers and welcome in your very cultured patrician home. It should be emptied. It gives you visions, pleasure and frivolity. It belongs in a surreal imagination. A dream from the Renaissance. Yes, in short it makes people damn barbaric. Cheers! Ah! My husband and I have written a book about it. About what? Erotic happiness in marriage. A guide to sexual intercourse technique. There are 42 sex positions. 43. Don't listen to her, it's 42. Uh, 42 what? There's the ordinary, where the woman lies on her back. Then there are 44. My husband is very liberal, I just tell you. He wouldn't say anything if you show me your bedroom. But it must be right now. Come on. What? Come on. How do you make love? Who? You and Sigrid. I don't know. On tables and chairs. Everywhere. Have you ever done it in the metro? - No, why? I'd like to, but Thorbjorn says it can't be done. It would probably work somehow. - He's very liberated otherwise. He says there are too many people. - Yes, especially during peak hours. Do you know how we make love? - No. We play. He binds me. He binds me with at rope at the bedpost. He's so liberated that he must bind me. Isn't it great? There he stands. With private number and everything. Can you read it? You shall not be modest. You must liberate yourself. He doesn't answer. Should he be able to escape? Hello? Who is it? Is this auditor Mortensen? One moment. Here comes someone, who will revise your perception of life. Hello? It's Peter Isl?v. Yes, yes, it's good. Come here. Hello, it's the famous barefoot dancer. Mr. Isl?v, I'll tell you what: wake me up - when I'm lying here and sleeping peaceful. Where are you? At my home. I've become a hussar, Mortensen. I'm in company with other hussars of both sexes. Let me say something to him. One moment. There's someone, who wants to tell you something. Old friend... Was that all? Hello, Mortensen? I have become a pornographic human being. And he's not happy with only reading about it. No, he actually does it. It was perhaps an idea. Well. But not in the metro and not on a tandem. No, because it's not possible on a tandem. Why don't you have a real car? I thought you liked this one. Such a stupid status symbol for playboys. Why did you want to go home now? It's such an awful season. Haven't I read the letters to you? The anonymous ones from my friend and Mortensen. What's so serious with it? You're not married to Peter. I'm getting mad. Keep your hands on the wheel. If you want to kill us I'd like go off here. Sigrid! Sigrid! Sigrid! Why the hell don't you answer? - You're in such a bad mood. What have you done? What do you mean? I've received a letter from Beatrice. Beatrice? Who is Beatrice? Now it's enough! She who left Peter Isl?v. Who's Peter Isl?v? Do you want to deny that you have written these letters to Beatrice? Well, these letters. Why tell that poor girl, that Peter is a great lover? Knows the poor girl that I have written the letters? No, you've written them anonymously. Why has the poor girl written to you? Why? Why? Because she believes in those lies. I must find out who it is, so she can get a divorce. What is it with you and Beatrice? - Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Not more than between you and Peter. Why are there no customers? - They'll come later, Mr. It's you who's early. - I can come even earlier. I could easily get a job but the city has changed. What has changed? - In this city you can't work. You can only make love and drink a little during the breaks and then make love again. I've realized that now. I've simply been an idiot before. Do you have a phone? Yes, there's a box in the corner, Mr. Thank you. Hello? Yes, I have found him. They said at the office, he'd be here. An awful, small bar, named Leda. No, Beatrice, you shoudn't meet him. He is a broken man. No...Well it's my fault. It's because I ran away from him. How can i say it? What? It's Sigrid. She has written anonymous letters to Beatrice. About what? About you. That you are her lover. I'm terribly sorry. Yes, me too. Lovely, you take it that way. - Sure I do. You are my friend. The worst thing is that Beatrice believes it. Sigrid has filled her with lies. She has... She has even written, that there is something between you and Lolly. That there is something between you and Lolly. Has she written that? Yes. Between you and Lolly. Wow, women. Do as I say now. Go home and pack everything you didn't get with you. I'll stop Peter, so you don't need to meet him. He's going to fly to Rome in three hours. The ticket is bought. Just let him get what he deserves. How much did you say? That was nice of you, Isak. Really. Well I'll do as you say. Hey hey. On the rocks. - As you like. I can't tell Beatrice, that Sigrid wrote the letters. Why can't you? -Because... Because... Think now. If I tell Beatrice, it's something that Sigrid has done. That Peter has never been her lover, that it's a lie. Can't you see what will happen? - No. Beatrice will say: "This is something she did only to... " "This is something she did only to... " Why has she done it? Well, nevermind, we'll never understand women. Not even me. No, you're right. Beatrice would think: "Poor guy, his wife's cheating him. " "She writes it even in letters but the idiot won't believe it." Beatrice may not think that about me. - No, I can understand that. So I can't help you. - It's okay. Well, all the best. I must return home to Sigrid. She's completely insane. She thinks there's something between me and Beatrice. And it has never been? - Not more than between Sigrid and you. Well, all the best, old boy. Jorgensen? He's a swinger. As you like, sir. Let me do it. Here you are. It's my turn. Who are you? - Isak Anderson. All right? Isak Anderson. How's your sports car? Very well, thank you. May I sit? I thought you were in Paris with my wife. We have just come home. Is Beatrice in town? - Yes. Where is she? - She don't want to see you. No, she certainly won't. - Although she has ties to you. Has she? - But more of pitifulness. You quit your work. - Why do you care? I have checked you. Accountancy professional, effective. And I need a leader. Shall we make a deal? What are you talking about? About a job as manager for my agency in Rome. 80,000 a year plus bonus. Own apartment. Pleasant job. You want to get rid of me. You're afraid Beatrice comes back. No, but I'm tired of her talking about you. You're boring me, Mr. Isl?v. Simply. Does she talk a lot about me? - Too much. What do you say so? I'll stay. Beatrice comes back. I just need to speak with her. I have changed completely. You're boring me more and more. What do you think, Peter? Aren't they beautiful? They are both sophisticated and practical. Where did you buy them? I've got them from Peter. Are you Beatrice? - Yes. Has he talked about me? Yes, very much. - Nicely? Yes, I think he loves you, but of course he loves many. Do you have a fortune, Mr Isl?v? - You know very well, I don't. Let's follow your logic and say that the improbable could happen - that Beatrice would prefer you before me. The idea is absurd, but all right. Beatrice has become habits. Expensive habits.
