Hi, Polly. -Hi. -Hi What's the matter with you, kid. What are you doing here? You shouldn't be here. You should be out in a convertible, bird-dogging chicks and banging beaver. Oh, wise guy, huh? Why I ought to... Ah, forget it. Your not even worth it, see. Moe. Moe? Who are you calling Moe? Hey, where are you going with that? Alright, you want to tell me what the hell is wrong with you? I'm leaving. -What are you talking about? -It's over, Paul. I'm moving out. Why? Because there's no future here. Oh Katy, this is ridiculous. Look, we've been together for three years. Living together for two. I want some security and I want to get married. So do I. We've already talked about this, remember? I'm just not ready. What's the rush with you? I'm almost thirty years old. I want to have kids just like the rest of my friends. And you will. Right now we can't afford it. You know that is such a cop out. If it were important to you, then we'd find the money. Just like you find the money for your art and for your trips to Europe. And now you've discovered karate. You just don't want to grow up. You sound just like my mother. You've been out of school for six years, Paul. You haven't had a steady job since I've known you. And that means that I don't love you? I'm not talking about love. I'm just telling you..... I can't do this anymore. Baby, come here. I mean it. Thanks. You really know how to spoil a guy's birthday. I wanted to tell you all week. I waited until after your birthday. I love you. I really care about you ...and, yeah, one day I want to....I wanna You don't know what you want. Please don't. (NOISES HEARD) COP: Hold it right there.

COP2: Guess they didn't teach you this at the academy, huh? What the fuck! Garland. Jesus! Katy! -What's wrong? -Get dressed! -Why? -There may be trouble, Katy. I saw someone beating a man. -Let's call the police. -Katy, it was the police. -Oh my God, you're kidding. -I think they saw me filming them... Katy, don't! Patterson, Let's go! Looks like they're coming up here. We'll take the stairs. -What are you talking about? -Look, those guys weren't fooling around! So what are they going to do to us? Well, we're not gonna stick around to find out. Come on COP: Third floor. This is crazy, Paul! We haven't done anything wrong. They're not going to hassle us. They probably just want the video tape. That's tough, Katy, because they're not getting it. Let's go! Patterson. Take the back stairs. Come on Garland! Hold it! I'll take that please. Shit! I forgot my car keys. Oh great. How are we going to get out of here because it's already light outside. They're going to see us. I don't know, but we've got no choice. -Fuck. -Police business. Go back inside and close your doors. -How do you like that? -What is it? I know this guy. He's in my karate class. He's a dick. What do you want to do? Davis....this is Garland... Alright, what did you get? PATTERSON: They got away, but I found his wallet. Oh, he got a wallet. You blew it, Patterson. I should have known better. Alright...wait downstairs. We'll handle this. This guy needs an ambulance. Beat it! Your not gonna leave this guy down here like this. -He's hurt. He needs an ambulance. -I said fuck off, boy! Oh, man. What are you going to do, give him a benediction. Let's go! I said, fuck off! Want to make something out of him? Fucking boy scout. This is great. This is fuckin' great. What do we do with him? Just going to leave him here. We'll say it was a drug deal gone bad. There was a fight. These assholes took off. Let's go to work. I should blow your brains out, mother fucker! Garland, what are you doing? What the fuck are you doing, man? You want to hit me, don't you? Come on. Come on. You wanna hit me, Amigo. Go for it. Hit me! (SCREAMING) (POLICE RADIO HEARD) You know, this time you've gone too far, Garland. They're going to nail us. Like I said, it was a drug deal gone bad. They made him jump. This is unbelievable! Just relax, Webster. He was a punk, a drug dealer. No one's going to miss him. Not even his family. We did the world a favor. Yeah, that's great... except for that videotape. Yeah, that is a problem. We've got to find them...fast. Whoa, whoa...wait a second. His address book. Now your thinking, pal. We can't sit here all day. I'm going to call my dad. Get him to pick us up. -I can't believe this. -I'll be right back. ANNOUNCER: An early morning drug deal leaves one man dead. That story next when the Morning News continues. MAN: We tell you that if you've had credit problems, we can probably get you financed... (RINGING) -Hello? -Hi, Dad. It's me. I'm sorry to bother you so early, but...I've got a problem. -Paul, what on earth happened? -Mind if I talk to him, sir? Son, the police are here. They want to talk to you. I didn't do anything, Dad. It was them. They want you to give yourself up. What's this about, son? Your mother and I are worried sick. It's alright, dad. I'll take care of it. I'll call you later. MAN: Thousand dollars' guess! I mean it. If we can't get... He hung up! ANNOUNCER: A drug deal has left one man dead near downtown LA this morning. Police say that Juan Sanchez was thrown, or possibly forced to jump, from a fire escape after what may have been an argument over narcotics. Officers are now conducting a house-to-house search for Paul Harrison and his live-in girlfriend, Katy McMartin, who managed to escape from police custody. Let's get out of here...... -Katy, do you have my wallet? -No. Shit! I must have dropped it somewhere. Great. -I've got ten bucks. -That'll get us far. How far do you want to go exactly? I don't know, Katy. It looks like we're wanted for murder. We don't have to run. We've got the tape. We can just prove we're innocent. You think the cops will let us do that? We'll take it to the press. We'll show them the tape. -Okay. I can call Jason. -No. He works for a TV station. He can probably help us. I don't care. Forget it. Come on... -What do we owe you? -Nothing, honey. It's on the house. Just don't hurt me, uh. POLICE RADIO: Suspects reported on foot. In the vicinity of third... (POLICE SIREN) (CAR HORN) Where does this bus go? I don't know. I didn't look. (TELEPHONE RINGING) Rise and Shine. Time to file that report, rookie..... Don't fuck with me, Patterson. Don't let me down again. I can make your life very miserable. Now type, God dammit! Jason Taylor, please. Do you know when he'll be in? No, that's alright. I'll call back. Thanks. -Well? -Another half hour. It was awful, Katy...watching them beat that guy like that. I thought the police were supposed to be helping people, not beating the shit out of them. What's wrong with this city? I don't know. I just keep thinking, how I've always tried to teach my students to trust the police. Well, these guys were thugs. We've got to take that tape to someone. Well, Jason will help us. Forget about Jason, Katy. You know, it was your idea to go to the press in the first place. Right. The press, not Jason. How often do you talk to this guy? Once in a while. Oh great. What do you talk about old times? I don't think that's really any of your business, Paul. Alright, let me get this straight. You and Webster follow this guy, Juan Sanchez, to an apartment building. And you wait downstairs and the next thing you know, Sanchez goes flying over the fire escape. -Is that what you're saying? -Yes, sir. Well, Garland, I think it's a bunch of bullshit. He was a well known drug dealer, sir. That's what you said about the last two guys you beat the hell out of. Now, you know my position on excessive force. I will not stand for it! If this proves to be bullshit, Garland, I'm going to have your ass kicked off the force, you understand? And that goes for the rest of you! -Now get out of here. -Captain. Patterson. Stick around... I want to talk to you. (PHONE RINGING) Is this what really happened? Yes, sir...Can I go please? Yeah, go ahead. Wait a minute. -How's your grandfather? -He's fine. -Give him my regards, would you? -Yes, sir. This Paul guy has got a lot of friends. Ya. We may have to call on a few. We're gonna get him, right Garland? Yeah. Let's hope it's before he turns us into TV stars. (PHONE RINGING) Taylor here. Katy? Where are you? I saw your picture on the morning news ....hang on. Jesus Katy, I knew that guy would get you into trouble. Listen to me. We didn't have anything to do with it. They set us up. Now, we have a videotape of the police beating that guy. Really! Jeez, Katy, I'd love to see it...I mean maybe I could get it on the news for you. That would really help us out a lot. We don't have a car, is there any chance you could pick us up? Oh, yeah, yeah sure... Oh, God, no.....I got a ride to work this morning. Shit. Alright, how about if we meet you somewhere. Okay. Let's meet at the train station at, say, One o'clock. I can walk there, alright? Okay. That's fine. Katy, be careful alright? This sounds really serious. Jason, please don't be late. What? He doesn't even own a car? Hello, mother. Your late. We had a problem at work. That's nice, but you were supposed to be here at eight.... You know it's Carmen's day off. I haven't had my breakfast yet. -Shit. -I heard that! Mother, what would you like for breakfast? Where is he? Just give him some time, okay? Great. I'm gonna use the bathroom. I'll be here. -Freeze. Your under arrest. -Robert! Get over here. -Bye. -Bye. There's a train to Vegas in an hour. Maybe Jason can lend us some money. Right. If he ever gets here. ANNOUNCER: Attention all passengers. Announcing the last call for the... We're going to miss the train. Alright. Let's go call him. Give me the purse. It's got the tape. Give me the purse, asshole. He went that way officer. Right down there, you see? Are you alright? Yeah. He got your wallet. He tossed this. There's a cop coming this way. I knew this was a bad idea. Come on. Get in. What? Get in! Our cars are gone. The police must have towed them. So, what do we do now? We have to go upstairs. I've got to get my credit card. It wasn't in your wallet? Katy, you know I haven't been using it. I owe too much money. I'm scared, Paul. So am I. Okay, wake up, Webster. -Hey, wake up. -Huh? I can't keep my fuckin' eyes open. You can sleep all you want after we find these little pricks. I'm going up to take another look around. I'll come with you. No. Stay here... and keep your eyes open. Bastards! Alright. Let's hurry... You know, I'm going to grab a couple of things from the bathroom. Make it quick. Got it, alright! (WHISTLING) (PHONE RINGING) PAUL'S VOICE: Hi, hello. Katy and I aren't in right now, so leave a message and we'll get back to you as soon as we can. Bye. (LOUD BEEP) SCOTT: Paul, this is Scott. Where are you guys? Listen, Mom and Dad are really worried about you. There were some cops at the house again this afternoon looking for you. Listen, call me. Alright? Maybe, I can help. (LOUD BEEP) I don't think so, pal. Going somewhere? -What do you want from us? -Where's your boyfriend. Right here, asshole. Let's go. Webster! Ah, son of a bitch! Jason, we waited for you for over an hour. Katy, I'm sorry. I got called to a meeting with my boss. I got there as fast as I could. Alright, look. I don't know what to do because we have to get out of here. We're going to drive to Vegas. Okay, okay. How about if I meet you there? (CAR HORN) Alright...uh, look, we really need your help, okay? So I'm going to be at my mother's. I'll call you when we get there, okay? Okay. So, what's his story? -He says he was there. -Yeah, right. -Are you okay? -No, actually I'm exhausted. I know. Maybe we should check into a motel or something tonight. Fine. Pass the bread? More spaghetti, anyone? No thanks, mom. Where are they? Why don't they call? MAN ON TV: New study proves that vegetarians have considerably lower levels of cholesterol than meat eaters of similar age and socio-economic level... In local news, LA police are still searching for Paul Harrison and Katy McMartin, suspects in the death of Juan Sanchez who died in the early hours of the morning near downtown Los Angeles. Police say they are investigating several leads into their whereabouts and hope to make an arrest shortly. We'll see about that. Do you always have to be such a smart ass about everything? You know, we're in a lot of trouble here. Your acting like this is my fault. Well, you know, if the shoe fits... You know, you're absolutely right, Katy. I set up the whole thing. It's all an elaborate charade just for you! What is it with you? What do you want me to do? Why don't you just turn the light off and let me get some sleep? Maybe it is a good idea that we split up. Yeah. Maybe it is, Paul, given that the only person in the world you care about is yourself... You know, I think sometimes that the only thing we really have is sex. Yeah...but it's good sex. Well you can have it by yourself from now on. How's that? Fine. Suit yourself, Katy. (SONG PLAYING ON THE RADIO) Good morning. What do you want? I'll ask the questions, okay? Okay, try it again. Wait, wait, wait. Alright. Try it again. Where are you going? To call a tow truck. Hey, hey, wake up, kid. Now, where's your brother? I told you, I don't know! It's going to take at least an hour. When's the next bus? We missed it. It left at nine thirty. This is just great. Shit! Chill out, Katy. Look, I'm sorry I had to get rough. I didn't mean to, okay? Your hand is broken. Here take it. What are you, a doctor? Listen to me, Scott. If you want to help your brother, you'll tell me where they are. I don't know. How did he meet Katy? College. Where? Nevada. Yeah, Las Vegas? Yeah, I think so. See, that wasn't so hard. Can I go now? Sure you can. Just a couple more questions. -Car trouble? -The battery is dead. I hate when that happens. You got any jumper cables in there? I doubt it. Where are you headed? Vegas. You guys want a ride or something? I can ask my old man. Hey, honey! Wanna squeeze in a couple of passengers? Sure. This is your lucky day. If it's all the same to you guys, we'll just wait for our tow truck. You know what Paul, why don't we just take this ride. Who knows what else is going to go wrong with this thing. She's right, you know. Once these rice-burners start to go, there's no stopping them. -Lance. -Hi. Paul. This here is my old lady, Devon. Hi. Hi. I'm Katy. Grab your stuff and throw it in the car. Katy, I don't feel good about this. You know what, Paul, at this point I don't really think we have a choice. Hey, Patterson. What happened to you? Nothing. I'm a little concerned about you, Robbie. I get the feeling you're going to let us down. Well, what happened the other night was really wrong. That's your opinion. We have a code here, Rob. We back each other up, no matter what. Guys who don't...well, let's just say they don't get on too well. Understand? Yeah. I understand. You don't have to worry about me. Just make sure I don't. Put your pants on. Sure looks like Baja out here. About 10 years ago, me and Dirty Dave and Spaceman... We got a pound of pot and a couple of chicks took our scooters clear down to the tip. We used to do a lot of runs. go to Willie Nelson concerts and stuff. What the hell do you kids do these days beside watch MTV? -Honey, I have to pee. -Again? -I can't help it. -Actually, I wouldn't mind stopping either. Women. -See you in a minute. -Mention my name. You'll get a good seat. He kills me. (BELL RINGS) Hey, that little girl of yours is cute. -You two married? -No. Yeah, I could tell. You like to party? Yeah. Sometimes. Maybe we ought to get a room. I think my old lady kind of likes you. I don't think so. Hell, I don't even think you kids know how to party anymore. You should have been at Woodstock, when I was a kid. I had three gals is one day- Right on the back of my old cycle. Hey booger, go out there and pump five dollars in that old car for me, would you? Yeah, sure. (DOOR BELL RINGS) How ya' doing? Five dollars for the beer. Five for gas. And a pack of camels. (RADIO MUSIC PLAYING) No! I want the kind with no filter. So, are you a real biker? No, kid. I'm the lone ranger. (BELL RINGS) What a jerk. I ought to kick his ass. I got me some new driving shades -and I got you all candy! -Hey! So, there was just one charge last night, right? The Annex Motel in San Bernardino. Okay, thank you, ma'am. I'll get right back to you. Thanks. COP: They're headed for Vegas. Yeah. I'll call the Vegas P.D. right now. Wise up. We've got to handle this ourselves, Webster. It says here that aliens are actually living in the White House, running the country. That sounds about right. They look just like humans. You can't even tell. (DISTANT SIREN SOUNDS) What do we got here? We weren't speeding. We are now. You're gonna get us killed, man!! Shut the fuck up!! I hate pigs... Let's see what this jerk wants. Get your hands on the car! Get your hands on the car! I said, hands on the car! Honey. -What the fuck!! -Get out of the goddamned car! What did you do that for -you stupid fucking idiot! -I didn't have any fucking choice! -You! Shut up! - No, not them! They can't do nothing to us. Relax. We'll take them to your sister's house. DEVON: We'll figure this out. Get in the car. Mother, are you ready? We still have a few minutes. That damned manicurist always keeps me waiting. -Are you feeling better? -Yeah, I'm fine. Want to talk about it? No. There's nothing to talk about. I fell. Don't lie to me. I can always tell when you lie, Dwayne. Tell mother what happened. Sound's like you need mother's help. They're probably half way to Vegas by now. You know I have friends in Vegas. (PHONE RINGING) -Yes? -KITTY: Joe! Who is this? It's Kitty Garland. Kitty! It's been a long time. Yes it has. Listen, I hate to bother you, but you always said if I ever needed anything... Of course, Kitty, what can I do for you? Well, my son is coming to Vegas tonight. He has a little problem. I'd like you to help find a couple of people for him. Sounds easy. It's very important, Joe. We'll fax their photos to you. Fine. I'll have a couple of my boys keep an eye out. Oh look, tell your son to call me when he gets in. Thanks. He'll do that. Always glad to help an old friend out. Joe Shaw is one of the most important men in Nevada. He'll put you on the right track. Your a doll. Now don't screw this up, Dwayne. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Molly here? She's tied up right now. We'll wait. Move it. Suit yourself. She's going to be a while. We've got time. -You wanted to see me, sir? -Yeah, come in, Patterson. Have a seat. I read your report. I think it's a bunch of bullshit. Have you seen these? Go ahead. Take a look. The autopsy report says they beat him up pretty badly before he died. Now let me tell you something- I know the way Garland and his pals conduct themselves in the field. In the past two years, I've had three excessive force complaints and every time, I try to do something about it, I'm told that I need more proof. I need a reliable witness. And that's where you come in, Robbie. I think you're that witness. Now that wasn't just a drug deal that went bad. Something else happened, didn't it? -I don't know, sir. -Bullshit! Sir, you have known my grandfather. -He was a police officer for forty years. -He was one of the best. And my father works downtown in Homicide. I've met him. Sir, the only thing I've ever wanted to be since the time I was five years old was a police officer. And the one thing my grandfather and my father both taught me... Was that you don't rat on your partners. So like the report says, sir, I don't know what happened on that fire escape and even if I did, I'd keep my mouth shut. Sir, I'm just starting out here. I've got to work with these people. Let me tell you something, Robbie. Loyalty is an admirable thing. But what about Juan Sanchez? Guy about your age. Maybe he was a tough street kid. Maybe he didn't have the breaks in life that you had. Look what they did to him. Does that mean he deserves to die? He's got a grandfather like you do. He's got a father He's got a mother. Now I want you to think about that- And think hard. Yes, sir. That's it. You can go. Thanks for coming in. What is it, Lance? How ya doin, Honey? Busy. Who are they? Friends. I told you not to bring people around here. Look, Molly, you got any crank? Lance is losing it. What else is new? -You got any money? -Hey! We're family. What's the matter? You don't trust me? You're an idiot, Lance. You always have been. Yeah, but I'm still your brother. Alright, big brother. You're in luck. I've got some killer shit for you. Good. You mind if I put them in the "guest room"? Lance, I'm not running a fucking boarding house here. Hey, that's alright with us. We'll just... Stay right here. Come on, Molly. Alright. You better take a rest, pal. This could be a long night. Look, you don't have to do this. I'm not gonna go to the cops. They're after me, too. Oh, yeah. For what? Jaywalking? Murder. Don't bullshit me, cockroach. It happens to be true. I hate bullshit! This is good crank. He's kicking again. Strong little fuck, huh? He was conceived in this trailer. Thought you could use this. Thanks. So, how did you and my brother get mixed up together? Just lucky, I guess. He's pretty crazy. Yeah. I've noticed. But he's family. Look... Can you help us get out of here? You're pretty. We don't get many boys like you around here. Maybe we can help each other. What was that? Nothing. I'm sorry... I can't. Are you sure? Yeah. Alright. Suit yourself. It could've been fun. I'll get your girlfriend. Get the hell out of here while you still can. Out that way. -You okay? -Yeah. Nice try, kids. What is it, Lance? Leave him alone, you asshole! Give me your arms! Give me your hands! Where are the fucking keys? Where are the keys? Here they are. Come on, let's get out of here. Thanks. Stop them for fuck sakes! God damn it, do something. Shoot that fucker. I'm gonna get you for this. LADY (ON PA): Welcome to Las Vegas. Please remain in your seats until the plane has come to a complete stop at the gate. We thank you for flying with us and look forward to serving you again. JOE: Thank you, Sparky. Are your rooms okay? -Yes, sir. -Are you boys comfortable? More than. I've taken the liberty of copying this fax. I had Sparky give it out to some of our people around town. They're pretty good at keeping their eyes open for us. Great. We appreciate it. It's none of my business, but what's this all about? What did these kids do? They're suspects in a murder case. A murder! That's awful. Nasty business. Frankly, sir, they are also in possession of a videotape that well, could... Embarrass us. Videotape. They didn't have that kind of thing when I was starting out. Sure you boys don't want a drink? It's never agreed with me, sir. Your mother's a good woman, Dwayne. I know, sir. Thank you. If these people are here, we'll help you find them. I owe her that much. Well, why don't you boys go back to your hotel. I've sent a couple of fine ladies over to entertain you. You do like ladies, don't you, Dwayne? Just checking. You can't be too sure these days. You know what I mean? Good night, sir. And thank you. Good night, boys. KATY'S MOTHER: Hello? Mom. Hi, it's me. Katy! I was going to call you on Sunday. Everything okay? Yeah, fine.

We'll see you tomorrow, okay? I love you. Did you reach Jason? Yeah. He is gonna meet us at my mother's tomorrow. At your mother's? Do you think that was smart? The cops could be watching her house. So, why didn't you think of something? You didn't ask. Why are you being such a jerk? I'm a jerk? Look who's talking. I'm risking my life here and you act like everything's my fault. Katy, we're in this together. Your getting pissed at me does not help the situation! Are you finished? -Quite. -Good. Let's go. What's the hurry? Jason isn't arriving until tomorrow morning. Is that what's bugging you? You're jealous. Frankly, I don't give a shit. I hope you two are very happy together. He's jealous. I love Las Vegas. I hope we find a room. Where are you going? The guy at the front desk said they offer coffee in the morning. I thought that I'd go get myself a cup. Mmm. Sounds good. Would you get me some, please? Maybe. Well, hello sweetheart! You live around here? Yeah. Good. I could use some company this morning. Would you like a little drink? I don't think so. Would you excuse me, please? Sure... You excused, no problem. Hey... Nice ass, sweetheart! Son of a bitch! Paul! Help! Does this mean a blowjob is completely out of the question? (SCREAMING) Paul. I like a frisky lady. You make me hard. Let go of her! Bitch! I ought to kick your ass. Oh, your gonna kick my ass? Meet my two partners Jake and Billy Bob. Alright you assholes! I want you three out of here in five minutes or I'm calling the cops. Relax mister. We're just having a little fun. Are you okay? Yeah, never better. Come on. Let's go. Man, I hate this job. Jesus Christ. It's like we're cursed, or something. Just lie still. What did you say to those guys? I didn't say anything. -Ow! -Sorry, sorry, sorry. You know, I don't think it's really all that bad. What is it about us? Why are we having such bad luck? What are you laughing at? Why are you laughing? I get the shit kicked out of me and she's laughing. Why are you laughing? I don't know. I've missed you. Patterson. What the hell are you doing here? You look like shit. I need to talk, sir. Alright? They beat Sanchez, okay. They hurt him real bad. And the fact of the matter is, sir, I hit him too. Garland had him taken up to the apartment. They got it all on videotape. Who's got it all on videotape? That couple Garland's so anxious to find. So they had nothing to do with it, huh? No, sir. Garland is just setting them up. Alright, Robbie. Alright, Robbie. You're doing the right thing. I'll help you through this. Hello, Sparky. I've got something you're interested in. (KNOCKING ON THE DOOR) Yeah, who is it?

We missed them by minutes. They're close - I can smell them. If you'd gotten your pants on sooner, we would have gotten them. Hey, Webster, you know something- You're starting to get on my fucking nerves. Hey thanks. Did you get it? Uh huh... Katy Jennifer McMartin. Graduated 1984. Father deceased. Mother's name is Valerie. The computer shows her last address as 102 Sunrise Way. That's not too far out of town. Good work. Have a hot dog. Thanks a lot. This is all they had, huh? -Hi, Mom. -I'm so glad you're here. -Hi, Mrs. McMartin. -Hi, Paul... Come in. -Something smells good. -I made you a cake. Come in the living room, kids. I have a surprise for you. KATY: Paul! How ya feeling, Paul? -Is everything alright? -Everything's perfect, Mom. You're not Katy's friends! Wow. You must be psychic. -Katy, who are they? -Alright, just cut the chitchat. I want the tape and I want it now. It's in the gym bag. Just take it. Webster. Yes! Okay, good. You got a VCR? Ma'am? She's blind, Garland. There's a video machine upstairs, in the guest room. I want to make sure it's the right tape, moron. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Hey! Are you expecting somebody? It's probably Anne. She looks after me. Okay, honey. Let's go. Let's find out who it is. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Katy! Jason... Hi. God, you look great. Thanks. Can I come in? It's really not a good day. Katy, what are you talking about? I just drove all the way from L.A. I want to see the video tape. Jason... Don't be rude, Katy. Invite your friend in. Katy, what is this? It's your worst nightmare, pal. Come and join us. Yes, sir. I've alerted the Nevada police. They're gonna try to bring him in. I just hope it's not too late. This Garland fella, he's really out of control. If you recall, sir, this is the same officer I tried to get fired two years ago. Yes, yes. He is kind of crazy. Yes, sir. We are working on it and we'll get it done. I make that promise to you. Yes, sir. Bye Bye. Alright, send Jack in, would you please? Yeah, now. Nice work. You could've had a career in television. Thanks. Something's burning. -Oh, my God. I've got a cake in the oven. -Go with her, Webster. Never a dull moment, eh, Paul? Don't just stand there. Open the back door. What kind was it? -Chocolate. -That's my favorite. Come on. Alright, Psycho, you've already got the tape. Why don't you let us go? Sure thing, pal. I'll do that. Okay. We're going for a short drive. What do you want to do? Take a wild guess. No, man. This is getting way out of hand. You're in it up to your ass, Webster. There's no other way. Don't get cold feet on me now. You know what they do to cops in jail? That's what's going to happen to us if we don't take care of this. No fuckin' way. Just fuckin' trust me, alright? We have the videotape, okay? It's cool. This is insane. Hey, life's a bitch, man! Fucking psychopath! Don't do this. Let us go. I can't do that. You know, I was mugged once. I swore that I would never let it happen again. You fuckin' stabbed me! You fuckin' stabbed me! There's a hospital near my house. Can you drive? Yeah. Yeah. Please turn the car around and let's get you some help. Okay. Okay. Where's my mother? She's fine. Now give me the keys. Start the engine. Don't do this, man. At least let them go. Games over for you kids. Hey! You think I'm kidding? You! Get out of the car. Move it! Easy. Jesus. Okay. Back up. Oh. Jesus Christ. Say hello to him for me. Oh God. KATY: Jason! Jason. Start the engine. -You really are fuckin crazy. -Too bad you didn't get that on videotape. Oh, I almost forgot give me my jacket. Okay. Come on, big guy. Give it your best shot! So what do you think? I don't know. You don't know? Wait a minute. I thought this is what you wanted! I'm asking you to marry me. I love you, Katy. I love you too, Paul. It's just... With everything that's happened, I don't know if I'm ready. Besides, when we do get married, I want us to have a real wedding. Alright. Okay. Come on. Let's go home.
