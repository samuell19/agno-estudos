[Explosion] A little known chapter in the history of the old west Began during the raging days of the civil war. While soldiers of the north and south Clashed on the battlefield, Military prisons on both sides Were woefully overcrowded. Men often died by the score, And those that did not generally existed In squalor, stink, and eroding monotony. When informed of these conditions, President Abraham Lincoln granted confederate prisoners The opportunity to enlist in the union army. They were not asked to fight their brothers in the south, Instead were ordered to help settle and patrol the west. Fighting indians, repairing roads, telegraph wires, And in some cases, To bring order to a lawless town. One such rebel to accept these terms was Lee Travis, Before the war A Mississippi riverboat gambler and gunfighter. In 1862, he had worn confederate gray. Two years later he was captured, And now, in 1865, Taking advantage of president lincoln's offer, He wore the blue yankee uniform And was embarked on a long journey To the untamed frontier town of colton, arizona... a town that for days did not know Lee Travis was on his way. Didn't know. Didn't care. Then the word at last reached mayor joe smith. More trouble from you, Mr. Mayor? Sheriff, this is the last trouble You'll ever get from me. Oh, bellyaching to the governor again. And he bellyached to the federal government. Here. Read this letter. "Appointment confirmed." What appointment? Read it. "Lee travis, U.S. Army special corps." You know what the special corps is? It's a special corps of yellow-Bellied rebs Who turned traitor and signed up with the yankees. You didn't read the rest of it. I don't read garbage. He's taking over your job. Nobody's taking over my job. Tell that to Lee Travis when he gets here. This town won't stand still for any ex-Reb, Especially one with the nerve to wear a badge. I intend to order our citizens To accept any sheriff that the government sees fit to send. The people of colton are sick of your orders. Like it or not, We're going to have law in colton. We'll vote on who they want for sheriff, Me or a yellow-Bellied reb. We will not vote on it. Either you hand in your badge peaceably, Or I make charges against you. What charges, Mr. Mayor? I let the saloon run all night? I'm in favor of gamblers and dance hall girls? No. Charges of graft. You don't know what you're talking about. You've been taking bribes from tom rile. I suppose you claim you got proof. Witnesses, sheriff. Enough witnesses to send you away for a long time, That is, if you make an issue of it. Colton's my town. It always has been. It was your town. [Commotion] This is your town, you said? That happens to be your deputy. Shelby can take care of himself. Then why don't you show him any respect? I never asked for a deputy. If I had, it wouldn't have been him. Leave Mr. Shelby alone! Leave him alone! Is he one of those witnesses you were talking about? No. Shelby's probably the only man in town That doesn't know you've been taking bribes. If he was a witness against me, I'd knock his block off. I bet you could. I bet you could lick any one-Armed man in town. What's this all about? It's nothing, sir, just a little-- The boys are just being a little playful. They get playful because you keep telling the boys You don't need a deputy. Well, I don't need a deputy. I never did. Thank you, Mr. Grover. The mayor here put shelby on the payroll Because, uh, well, what can you do with a cripple Back from the war? Mr. Rile, he lost the use of that arm Fighting for scum like you. I don't need anybody to fight for me. And I don't need charity, So I'm turning in this badge. If you do, there'll be no law here at all, Except a former reb. What's that about a reb? We're getting a new sheriff. A man fresh from an army prison camp is coming. A reb? You being a former yankee, I thought it might be of some interest. It is. We don't want any rebs in this town. I hate to agree with Mr. Rile, but he's right. Her brother lost his life fighting the rebs. [Mayor] Well, there's nothing any one of you can do. What's going to happen to sheriff grover here? He's quitting. Why? He's a good sheriff. I can't understand it. He still looks up to you. This reb that's coming, His name is Lee Travis. [Mayor] He'll be here in a couple of days. I suggest we give Mr. Travis a nice warm welcome. From what I hear of him, I suggest you and your hooligans Clear out of town before he drives you out. Don't let it upset you. You know, I just don't understand it, Bringing a reb here. I know how you feel. Come on. I'll walk you to your shop. The usual. Lee travis. Mm-Hmm. I know about him. That mayor don't scare me. He thinks I won't take care of a turncoat reb, He's mistaken. You can try taking care of him. What, the mayor? Lee travis. I told you I heard of him. Oh, that's right. You're from the south like him. Been a while ago. How'd you hear of him? Is he famous down there? You might say that. Famous for what? Riverboat gambler, gunfighter... yeah? You ever meet him? Wish I had. Once, in new orleans, he walked right past me. As close as that. He gets that close to me, he'll be a dead man. Talk was, he was real fancy with that gun. Is that right? Grover, you ain't giving up that badge. If I don't, there'll be a lot of trouble. Suppose I have the boys take care of travis on the way in. It isn't that easy. I'll make it that easy. Word would get out how it happened. They'd figure I planned it to save my job. Why don't you have your renegade apache friends Arrange a quiet little one-Man massacre of Lee Travis? Then there won't be suspicions our sheriff's behind it. Do you know some renegade apaches? Always opening your big mouth, ain't you? Anyway, this is no job for them. I didn't know you had any dealings with indians. You still don't know. That's what I pay you for-- Not to know anything. What is it, tom? You selling the apaches whiskey or guns? Better put that blindfold back on. No wonder you got so many gunslingers working for you. You look healthier with that usual dumb look on your face. I can only go so far with that look. Then something gets stuck in my craw, And I can't get it out. Yeah? What, your conscience? Go ahead, say it. I ain't had a good laugh all day. I can't go along with letting you murder lee travis. Listen to me, old man. I aim to have you keep that badge, So you'll go along with anything I say, And if you don't, I'll-- You'll kill me, too? Here. Go ahead. Ah, I ought to-- What stopped you, The fact he's already dead? And I'd swear what he died from Was something that got stuck in his craw. Something funny going on here. What do you mean? Sheriff grover, he's a landmark in this town, A permanent fixture. They can't just throw him out. I can't help but think that mayor smith is behind this. Next year there'll be an election, And sheriff grover is a very popular man. There was talk of running him for mayor, And Smith's bouncing him out before that can happen. It certainly doesn't seem fair. It isn't fair. I'm going to talk to sheriff grover. I'm going to ask him to stay on here, no matter what. From now on, looks like you're the law around here for a while. Mr. Grover, I could never fill your boots. Besides, you know all this is just political. Political or not, there's the badge right there on the desk, Along with the graft money that goes with the job. Graft money? Maybe a better way to describe it is blood money. I had no idea. You're wearing a bigger blindfold than I did. So that's why you never wanted a deputy around. Tom Rile-- The biggest man in town and the dirtiest. He said I had to leave that badge on. I could never handle this job without you, As deputy or anything else. Then quit. I just did. Mr. Grover... hadn't you better take some of this? What for? A man can't live without money. I'll tell you something, son. When it's that kind of money, A man can't live with it. What about this reb that's taking over as sheriff? Rile's having some of his men Bushwhack him on the way in. Don't worry about it. He'll never get here. It's a pity. He might've been just what this town needs. Not a rebel. I don't want to see another one as long as I live. If rile's men don't get that reb, Maybe I'll kill him myself. [Door opens] He's gone. Gone for good. I saw him go. I heard what you said about the new sheriff. You intend to let rile's men kill him before he gets here, And if they don't, you will? All right, you heard, and I meant it. Why shouldn't I kill him? Because then this town would really belong to rile. Better him than a filthy rebel. But you forget, Lee Travis changed sides. Then he's worse than a traitor. Well, look at it this way... he's not in the war anymore. He's a human being like you. He's trying to pick up the pieces and live the best he can. Love thy enemy, huh? Well, not me, Jill. Do you realize that you're the only lawman left here? Now that Mr. Grover's gone, I guess you're right. It's your sworn duty to uphold the law. That means nothing? Of course it means something. Then it's your duty to warn Lee Travis That he's riding into a trap. No. To me, he's still the enemy. You're not in the war anymore either. There is no enemy. You had a brother. He was killed by the confederates. That doesn't blind me to what's right and what's wrong The way it does you. Maybe that's what Mr. Grover found out And was trying to tell me. There is a right and a wrong. Then you will warn him? Jill, I don't know. I've got to... I've got to think about it. I saw him up ahead, and he's coming this way. You sure it's Lee Travis? He's wearing a yankee uniform. I don't see no sign of him now. That's because he's riding between those rocks. It's mighty obliging of that turncoat reb To come riding straight to us. Any chance he spotted you? He wouldn't pay any attention To an innocent cowpoke. You talk like he has a suspicious mind. I've got a suspicious mind. Let's go get him. No. You two wait on both sides of the trail. We'll bushwhack him proper. I'll nice-Talk him and lead him to you. You have it all figured out real nice. Yeah. Now get going. [Horse whinnies] Rein in that horse, mister. Now, unholster your gun real slow. Drop it to the ground. Mister, your voice sure ain't familiar. I'm Ike Clanton from over in Colton, And I ain't out here looking for trouble. I said drop the gun. What's this all about? I'm just here to meet our new sheriff. Get off your horse. You ain't him? Lee Travis. Well, curly said you would... we expected to see you in uniform. I know. Wish I could figure you out. Don't bother. I figured you out. I was just riding along looking for you. The way I hear it, You're going to be our new sheriff. You heard right. The reason I'm here is, I appointed myself a welcoming committee of one to greet you. Have a cigar. Tie up your animal. You've got some kind of a mistaken idea about me. Well, let's put it this way. Either I made a mistake, Or you made a mistake. Now put on that uniform. You're going to be a soldier boy. Oh, no, I ain't! Put it on! You couldn't give me some reason? I don't want to be bushwhacked. Who would do a thing like that? I don't understand where you got such an idea. Through a pair of binoculars. You figure there's going to be an ambush, And you're going to make me ride into it. If there isn't any, you got nothing to worry about. Suppose there is? Then they'll see that uniform And start blasting away before they know it's you. You don't give a man much of a chance. No. Neither do they. But they'll kill me! Yeah. You instead of me. Now, mister, I ain't going to put on that uniform. I can kill you now, Or you can put on that uniform and take your chances. You can have your gun. If they start shooting, you can shoot back. Shoot at my own men? What kind of choice is that? Only choice you got, Because I'll have you covered all the way. Now, get over there! They'll be coming up through here. You get over there. [Horses whinny] Here they come. Keep going. Ike's right behind him. He'll get Travis from the back. We'll get him from the front. All right. Let him have it. It's me, Ike Clanton! Don't shoot! Curly, it's me, Ike Clanton! Nice to meet up with a lawman. Who are you, mister? The name's Lee Travis. I might've guessed. Who are they? Didn't mention their names. Ike Clanton. Friends of yours? Friends of mr. Rile's. Uniform belongs to me. I asked him to put it on. Rile sent him and two others to bushwhack you. I came to warn you. You're a little late. Maybe I was hoping I'd be late. That's real friendly. Name is shelby, Mr. Travis, and I'm not friendly with rebs. Fact is, I hate their guts. You must be the deputy of colton. The town that doesn't want An ex-Confederate soldier for its sheriff. Look like everybody's going to be real friendly. I bet you don't last the week. Never bet a professional gambler, Mr. Shelby. Here. Here are your prisoners. Two cards. I call. Take care of that for me? Deal me out. What happened? Tricked us. Where's Ike Clanton, Ed Jones? Dead. Dead? Shelby. Who's that under the blankets? Mr. Rile, you might be more interested In knowing who he is. He's Lee Travis, our new sheriff. Mr. Rile... I met your welcoming committee. Oh? I'm happy shelby was able to meet you. If he didn't tell you, I will-- We don't want you here. That's what they said. They? What, a couple of dead men? One of them's Ike Clanton. Bury your dead, Mr. Rile. Welcome or not, I'm here. I welcome you, Travis. I'm Joe Smith, mayor of Colton. Sure you want to shake hands with an ex-Reb? Ha. It is rather unusual to have a former confederate as a sheriff, But most of our able-Bodied men Are off at the war. These are trying times. Tell your citizens they're going to have to try a little harder. Travis! This time i'm going to try a little harder. No, curly. Not here. When I'm paid, I deliver. That's enough. I'm not paying attention to you, Mr. Rile. This is for Ike. Give him an even chance. What difference does it make to you? My chance was to draw against my own friend, My own friend that I killed. Told you he was fancy with that gun. You hire a killer, You're just as guilty. - He didn't kill you. - He tried. I tried to stop him. You heard. I heard you sent him out to ambush me. I say that's a lie. His word against yours. And he's dead. But you're not, Mr. Rile. And you'll be seeing me. You're going to be seeing a lot of me. There are three coffins being delivered to the doc's. Here's the bill. Give that to Tom Rile. He'd throw it right in my face. You're wearing Mr. Grover's badge. You give it to him. Found this laying here. Blood money. Graft. Grover said it goes with the job. Sounds interesting. Good-Sized pot. You figure on keeping it? Depends on what I have to do for it. Let Rile run his saloon how he wants to-- Wide-Open gambling, Dance hall women, Men shooting up the place, Citizens being molested. That's all you have to do to earn it. Over 3,000. Grover must have been collecting quite a while. Must be more where it came from. At least you don't even pretend to be honest. I don't pretend to be anything. If Rile's place were closed up, This might be a quiet, peaceful, normal town. I'll tell him you said that. Tell mr. Rile I'd like to see him. He isn't here. Never is until the action starts-- At night. Well, hello, Roy. Never thought I'd see you in here. Buy you a drink? Thanks. I don't drink. I came to have a look At this man they call lee travis. You're looking. Since I'm going to be killing rebs, Thought I might look at one up close. Sounds like you're enlisting in the army. Hasn't gone before because his pa died. His mother needed help with the ranch. When I heard you were in town, I signed up pronto. Wish you luck. Don't need no luck from your kind, Reb. Your friends in the south need the luck. Bye, Miss Molly. Goodbye, Roy. Nice kid. This bill needs paying. Pay it, Jim. Mr. Rile gives you a lot of authority. I know where the body's buried. That's for three of them. Take it out of petty cash. Some people I know would call that important cash. Not in here. If you don't believe me, Try our dice tables. Got a feeling you'd like that. I like excitement. I happen to know you used to be a gambler, A very exciting gambler. You happen to know a lot. I've been around. They give you a name where you came from? That "from" is new orleans. Interesting. So's the way your eyes just lit up. They always do when the band plays dixie. But you're a yankee now. Old habits die hard. That name they gave me-- I changed it to Molly. It was probably moella. Right the first time. Good old magnolias-In-Bloom name of moella. That ought to make you feel at home Here in hostile country. Most gambling places... entice their customers with free drinks. Bring a bottle to the table, Jim. It's been a long time Since anybody did that for me. Sounds like you're homesick. Not really. I don't blame you for changing sides. South can't win the war. They haven't got a chance. I don't agree. You must think it's hopeless, Or you wouldn't be a yankee these days. I'm told a gambler Likes to be on the winning side of anything. I know you from somewhere. You saw me perhaps because I saw you once, But we never met. It was aboard the Mississippi riverboat mohican On the night run to Memphis. Never been to memphis... or even on a riverboat. Seems a shame. Who was this woman you met on the night run to memphis? Looked like you. To a band playing dixie. No... let's say, to a man you think is a traitor. I never ask what a man is. Moella, You just became more enticing than this drink. Well, I hope so. I'm going to check in at the hotel, Take a long, hard look At this town I'm sheriff of. If you're leaving so soon, I wasn't very enticing after all. Moella, I came to see Rile. He'll be back tonight. So will I. I'll be waiting. Moella. I seem to be having a little trouble. That's hard to believe. Uh, my name is Jill Wyler. The lady that asked that hooligan to give me a fair chance? Yes. Do you mind coming into the store, please? I think I met you once before... aboard the Mississippi riverboat mohican. On the night run to Memphis? Yes. Whew. I almost made a mistake. That saloon woman-- Molly-- I thought she was my contact. Well, she's not. We can't talk here. Expecting somebody? Just customers. Close the store. At midday for no apparent reason? You're right. Somebody would notice. They might wonder. We do have to talk. I realize that, but I just don't know where. Here. Go to my hotel room. Use the side stairs. I'll meet you there. Your hotel room? Nobody would see us there. I suppose not. You're as nervous as a cat on a dark night. Well, I-- I guess I'm an amateur At this business of war games And intrigue, Mr. Travis. Here comes a customer. You better go out the back way. Out this door. If I'd run into anyone, I was going to say i was delivering a hat. Probably isn't my size. Small town like this, A girl has to be careful of her reputation. You're still nervous. You were a prisoner of the union army? Over a year. Then the confederacy suggested I volunteer as a yankee So I'd be of use again. You managed to get transferred here? Espionage network we have high up in yankee circles managed it. Well, you know what the assignment is. I was supposed to be contacted by a beautiful woman, And she'd tell me. Well, it's a large cache Of arms and ammunition. That much I know. The south stored it here secretly At the start of the war. They expected to overrun this territory, But they didn't. Secretly-- So these people didn't know about it. More important, the north didn't know. Obviously, or they'd have taken it. Our armies in the south now need it badly. Figures. The south's running out of everything-- Guns, ammunition... even spies. Why else would they recruit an amateur? Or riverboat gamblers? Did they tell you where the guns are? The paper describing the location was lost. Weeks after I got here, I got a letter telling where they should be. Should be? Didn't you check to make sure they're still there? Haven't you done anything? They're hidden under the floor Of an abandoned warehouse south of town. I didn't want to risk Someone seeing me rip up the place. All right. Calm down. Anyway, if the guns are salvageable, We notify a small group of our soldiers. They're waiting 50 miles from here. You're to lead them when they ride in with the wagons, And you're to take the weapons at gunpoint. Does that sound like I've been doing my job? You have quite a temper. Well, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. I just-- I know. Still nervous. I'll have to know when you intend to go to the warehouse So I can signal the soldiers. Meet me tonight at my office. I'll know my plans by then. You forgot your hatbox. It's empty. You keep it. A man's got to watch his reputation. Suppose somebody found A woman's hatbox in my room. I didn't know you were acquainted With anyone in the hotel. I went to deliver a bonnet to Mrs. Simpson. Mr. And mrs. Simpson left town this afternoon on the stage. That's what I found out. If you'd used the front entrance, The hotel clerk could have told you that. Dan, you've been very nice to me Since I came to Colton, But every time I turn around, there you are. You mean like now. That gives you no right to pry into my affairs. Travis is going to look pretty funny With ribbons on his hat. I'm not surprised you paid him a visit. When he rode into town, You couldn't take your eyes off him. And the way you worried When you thought curly might kill him. Did you know him somewhere before? I never saw him before in my life. So you had to go see him just to get acquainted. All right, I did go see him-- To ask him to leave town. I said he'd only be trouble In a place he wasn't wanted. You had to go to his hotel room for that? He was a perfect gentleman. Perfect southern gentleman. I don't have to explain anything to you. No... not even why you came sneaking down the back stairs. I didn't want to be seen coming out of the hotel. What's the real reason you went to see him? I told you. I wonder. You go ahead and wonder all you want. I'm sorry. Maybe you're right. Maybe it isn't any of my business. It's just that I care for you a lot. Maybe... maybe I care too much. [Door closes] [Piano plays] I see you took the ribbons off. All Jill Wyler's hats have ribbons on them. I wouldn't know. Maybe you didn't like the style Of the one she brought to the hotel. Something else I don't like-- A nosy deputy. I'm not being nosy. I'm just concerned about the morals of our new sheriff. Only thing you're concerned about is Jill Wyler. [Hoofbeats, hollering, and gunshots] Same thing every night-- Deserters and draft dodgers. Lot of action for a place this small. It's the only gambling within 100 miles. They come from all over. Drovers, cowhands... along with all the riffraff and scum of creation. You're waiting for me to say it's my job to stop it. It is... If you're keeping the money Mr. Grover left. I don't suppose you'll do any more than he did. Maybe you'd better go over to the saloon, Keep an eye on things. I was figuring on staying here, letting you do your job. I'll be along later. Sure, sheriff. Anything you say. Been expecting you. I had to wait till you were alone. Your friend shelby worries about you. I've been waiting to tell you-- He knows I went to see you. So he mentioned. But he doesn't know why. I hope you're right. If he guesses the real reason-- No, no. He thinks that I was... immediately attracted to you. Love at first sight. That's the way his mind works. Let it work that way. What do you mean? Gives us an excuse to be seen together. You can visit me anytime, anywhere. What'll the good people of colton think of me? Better if they think that than the truth. I suppose you're right. If they find out you're a spy, We'll both go to prison... if we live long enough to get there. Then we're to pretend we're... close friends. Lovers, Miss Wyler. It might even help if, uh, we're seen Being somewhat more than friendly. I-- I don't think that's necessary. I do. I think I'm being watched. Why? A rebel in town, bound to make some people edgy. Rile, maybe. My guess is he's not sure of anything, Just wants somebody keeping tabs To see what I'm up to. If I'm being watched, That means we're being watched. Let's, uh, make it interesting. There's no point. The shades are drawn. We'll make a silhouette. We'll also make a lot of gossip. Mr. Travis-- After you've kissed a man, You're entitled to call him by his first name. You're very lighthearted. You can close your eyes to the fact That we're losing the war? You just closed yours. Since you are probably being followed, I suggest you stay away from the warehouse for a while. If someone's suspicious, You wouldn't want to lead them to the cache. If somebody's watching, I'll shake him, Then I'll slip over to the warehouse. All right. I'll meet you there before daylight. If the guns are there, I'll send word to the soldiers. The quicker, the better. Wait a minute. Won't do any harm if I walk you home. In fact, now it wouldn't look right if I didn't. I'm sure dan will see us. Dan shelby, your deputy. You're supposed to be his girl? I'm nobody's girl. To all intent and purpose, you are now. My girl. Dan's sympathetic. I told him I had a brother who was killed in the war. Did you? No. I was told to say that. Excuse me. Hold it. Here's something else to tell mr. Rile you saw. Uhh! What are we doing here? I live upstairs. I'll see you early in the morning at the warehouse? Yes. Well, then... I guess for the moment there's nothing else to discuss. We...could discuss you, miss Wyler. Miss Wyler? After you kiss a woman, you're entitled-- Jill. Lee. There. End of formalities. I'm curious to know how you got yourself Into this situation-- Working for the confederacy. Well, I was born in the north But raised in South Carolina. Loyalties to the south, hmm? When they told me I was needed,I accepted. Sounded exciting? It is exciting. Mmm. But dangerous. Yes, and I'm looking at the danger. Someone's looking at us, too. There's more danger in this town than you think. You and me and a handful of rebs taking those guns-- We should do it under cover of darkness. After dark, this town is wide-Open, Crawling with people. And a lot of them gunslingers. Gunslingers who just won't watch. Sight of a gray uniform would trigger them good. There's nothing you can do about it. The confederacy probably couldn't spare More than a handful of soldiers. Those men are here, And they will be here every single night. If the saloon, the gambling, and the women are gone, They wouldn't have reason to come. We'd have a nice, quiet town to operate in. But the saloon is here. I may have a way to close it. It'll take more than a gun and a badge. That's not what I had in mind. This money originally belonged to tom rile. I'll give him a chance to get it back. Oh, lee... be careful. At least until we can get those guns delivered. For a crazy moment there, I thought it was me you were worried about. For a few crazy moments, I was. [Gunshots] [Yelling] You're a real southern fancy dandy with the ladies, aren't you? Go over to the office and hold it down. Sure, I'll do your job. Go on inside and enjoy yourself. You said you hated my guts. I didn't know it was going to show this much. If I can get anything on you... you're the one who's had this saddle tramp follow me? Every move you make. I thought it was rile hired him. Someday you'll make a mistake. You'll say something or do something-- My mistake was keeping you on as deputy. You don't need anybody following me. You can do it yourself. Tell him he can go home. Maybe the trouble with you is, You're still fighting the war. No, maybe that's what you're doing. Yeah, maybe that's it. Go on home. From here on in, he's mine. Been waiting for you. Well, I was hoping Mr. Rile was waiting for me, too. I have been waiting for you, sheriff. You said I wasn't wanted as sheriff here. Well, I don't always get everything I want. I do. I want you to get out of this town. That's pretty hard talk for a turncoat reb. Came to do a little gambling. That talk's more like it. What's the house limit? There's no house limit. If the customer has the money, we'll cover his bet. A loser can keep doubling till he's wiped out? A big gambler like you Ain't worried about the go-Brokes in any town, is he? Sheriff grover left this behind at the office. I was told it once belonged to you. That ain't my money. Good thing you said that, Because I'd have to arrest you for bribery. I was told it goes with the badge here. It does. Since you're sheriff now, it's yours. She could be right. Well, Easy come, easy go. The table doesn't seem to be busy for the moment. May I roll? Yes, sir, your dice. Coming up. The whole thing. That's a lot of money to bet on one roll. You can stand it, I can. I can stand it. Coming out. Seven! The winner. The whole thing rides. Double or nothing. I'm not covering that bet. A big man like you Is going to be a cheap tinhorn? I don't have that much money here tonight. I say you do. Go to the office safe and get it. And while you're there, I want to see the legal document That proves you own this saloon. I own it, all right. Bring the deed. You're pressing. Maybe I feel lucky. Winner take all? Bother you? Not my money. You got your stake free, but he can be hurt. You heard what he said-- A gambler like me doesn't worry about go-Brokes. Same shooter coming out again. Four! The point is four. Four, sheriff. It's the hardest number there is. Six! The point to make is four. Nine! The point to make is four. Four! Four the point, four the winner. Deed for the place? You just lost your insurance policies. Deed for the place. Take your money and get out. I'm clean. I'm shooting for the saloon. I'm not betting the saloon. Yes, you are. The saloon against all that money. You're the big gambler around these parts, Man who says sky's the limit. You can't afford to lose a reputation like that. No, no bet. I might shoot snake eyes. You'd be the big winner. You're the big winner tonight. Don't push it. I am pushing it. And you're going to stand still for it. A lot of people have been wiped out Because of your no-House-Limit rule. You try to change it now, You may not walk out of here alive. Now, like the lady says, Winner take all. 11! Front-Line winner. Here... boss, Souvenirs of the house. High roller, high stakes, as the saying goes. You have until tomorrow noon To close this place up and get out. [Knock on door] [Knock knock knock knock] I realize it's late. Must be important. A woman's life is important only to herself. How she looks, that's important. What she's going to do next, That's very important. Now that rile's moving out, hmm? Stagecoach fare to somewhere could be important... if what she has to tell is worth the price. Rile's closing the saloon up tight. He's got no other choice. Leaving me high, dry, and stranded. That's no way to treat a lady Who knows where the bodies are buried. Those are my sentiments exactly, And that's why I'm here. He always said I had a big mouth. Now I'll prove it. A woman scorned. Let's just say, a little something I want to leave him to remember me by. All right, Where's the bodies buried? Not bodies--Guns stored in a warehouse. Boxes of them. How'd he come by them? Bought an old warehouse and found them. Must belong to somebody. He don't know or care who they belong to. He's been siphoning them off for months And selling them to renegade indians. I thought the sheriff here ought to know that. He's loading up a wagon of them right now And intends to come back for the rest tomorrow. Moella, you just got yourself a stagecoach ticket. Glad there's something you're interested in. All right, that's good. Let's go. Get on. [Horse neighs] Let's go. Hyah! Hyah! Pull up! We can't outrun him. Whoa! I got him. Hyah! Giddyup! Hyah! Hyah! Better late than never. What happened to you? I've been shot. Who was it? Never mind. The bullet's still in there. I know. I saw enough rifles in that warehouse To make it worthwhile. Can you get that message off to the soldiers? After I take you to the doctor. I guess shelby stopped following me. I talked to him last night. He likes you too much to be suspicious of you, too. You didn't help his suspicions any. It was cruel of you To take the badge from a one-Armed man. You said you were nobody's girl. I wasn't, and I'm not. I'm all right. Get that message off. How'd you get in here? I broke in. This time you've gone too far, Dan. No, it's the other way around. You've gone too far. What are you talking about? I saw you walking travis into the doctor's office. What of it? Looked like he'd been shot, and you brought him. Yes, I did. I found him down the street. The street you just happened to be riding on this early? I don't know who shot him or why. Well, I think you do. And these letters I found in your room-- You have no right to go through my things. I went to the livery stable. They said Travis left during the night. When I saw your horse and buggy was gone, I decided to look around. Those letters-- They're from South Carolina. You had them hidden. I tore your room apart because I knew I'd find something. I knew it wasn't just valentine's day With you and him. Give me those letters! Travis told me I was still fighting the war. I figured he was talking about himself, And you were part of it. Tell me what happened to get him shot. I want to know what you two were up to. I have nothing more to say to you. Well, I'm going to have a lot to say. You won't tell me, Maybe one of these letters has. It mentions an old abandoned warehouse at dos cabezos. So I'm going out there and have a look around myself. Look at you. I shouldn't have told you about the warehouse. Good thing you did. You could have been killed. Came close at that. It would have been my fault. Well, you got any faults, I can't see them. I--I suppose you Came here to inspect the premises of your new saloon. What I'd like to inspect is a plate of food, hmm? Breakfast coming right up. Thank you, moella. Anytime. Anything anytime. Have you seen sheriff Travis? No, ma'am, I haven't. Your baggage checks are all in order. Sorry you're not coming with us. Would you put these on top of the stage? I'm leaving with only two passengers. I'll put them inside. There's plenty of room. They'll ride a lot better. No. I want them on top with you. If I'd hit a bump, These hatboxes will fly off like a flock of birds. Tie them down like the other cargo on top. Well, O.K., We'll put them on top. Wait a minute. Those boxes up there Would be like flying a flag, wouldn't it? I tried to tell her I'd put them inside. Well, they're not going anywhere. Ma'am. You're trying to signal someone To come after that shipment of guns in the warehouse. Those guns are marked "army of the confederacy." Go on, deny that you and travis are spying. Hyah! Hyah! Shelby, perhaps you'd like to explain what's been happening here. Ask her. Or Lee Travis is in the doctor's office. Maybe he can explain. No, he's not. He's in the saloon. I saw him go in. Mayor, with your permission, I'd like to put this back on. I didn't know you'd taken it off. I didn't. Well, there he is-- The confederate spy. And Jill Wyler, she's-- She's working with him. Is that true? He found out. He stopped the signal. Yeah, It's true. Sure had me fooled. I welcomed you to colton. You're the only one that did. I trusted you, accepted you. You tried to bring the war to a town Where you swore to uphold law and order. Rebel law and order. Here, cover me. You relieved me of my badge. By authority of mayor smith, I'm wearing it again. Now I'm the law here. Arrest him. Just a minute, mayor. I have a score to settle with him first, A personal score. He's wounded. One arm in a sling-- Kind of evens things up, doesn't it? If you say so. I say so. Shelby! He's still fighting the war. I'd like to do some more fighting of that war Right here and now. I don't want to fight you. Why? Because I learned to fight with one arm and you haven't? If you're going to fight, do it in the street. He knows I own this saloon now. He'd enjoy busting it up. You're what I'm going to enjoy busting up. Aah! Lee, stop this! Stop it! [Gunshot] I've seen all I want to see of this. Please, let me finish this. You'll finish each other. You said you wanted to arrest him. Go ahead. There's sheriff Grover. Ex-Sheriff Grover. I never expected to see you back here. I come to tell you the war's over. Lee surrendered to grant. I don't believe that. Pony soldiers are riding the news to towns without telegraphs. We won. That must make you very happy. Before anybody starts celebrating, I think you ought to know There's going to be a war right here In colton... today. What are you talking about? Mr. Mayor, all of you, I owe this town an apology. When i took tom rile's money, I didn't know it was a cover-Up To running guns to indians. He's been doing that for a long time. On my way back last night, I saw rile in a wagon. Loaded with guns? I followed him. He unloaded those guns to a band of renegade indians. He's coming back for the rest. He knows he has to get them out fast. [Mayor] we'll fight him. We'll have our hands full. He's bring those savages with him. They figure to sack the town. You said we'll have our hands full? Least I can do to make it up to this community Is to stay and be of what use I can. I'd like to make the same offer. Better take them up on it. Those gunslingers and deserters that hang out at the saloon Are long gone in the daytime. I do take you up on it. We don't need him to protect this town from anything. Oh, please. The war is over. You heard what the lady said. The war is over. Whether you like it or not, That goes for the town of Colton, Arizona. You ask me, they'll head straight for the warehouse. Not a chance. They know they got to take us first, Because of Lee Travis. Watch out for tricks. I don't look for any tricks, Mr. Travis. They'll come a-Chargin' right down that street, Figuring to wipe us out to a man. Rile knows we're short-Handed. I still say they're at the warehouse right now. Aah! [Whooping] Hyah! Aah! [Speaking native language] Rile, up here! The man you put the blindfold on. I want you to look at me while I'll kill you. Wear that badge in good health, yankee. Well, thanks. I'm going to try real hard, reb. Take care of that little girl from South Carolina, too. I'm going to try real hard about that, too, If she'll ever forgive me for reading her mail. Moella, you always did want your own saloon. Here's the deed. Lots of things I've always wanted. A saloon is just one of them. [Mayor] sorry you won't stay. Oh, those mississippi riverboats will be running again soon. And you're a born gambler. Always has been, always will be. I might get a hot lick some night, Win one of those big paddle-Wheelers of my own. Call it the mohican. Put it on the night run to memphis. Everybody hopes for something. Nobody lives without hope.
