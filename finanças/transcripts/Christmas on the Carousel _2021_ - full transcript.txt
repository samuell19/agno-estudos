That wasn't startling at all. You may not know this but Christmas was originally about a good solstice fright. It's about time that tradition was restored. Could have sworn it started in a manger actually, little baby, three wise men. No such thing. You're talking fairytales whereas I prefer an old fashioned Victorian ghost story, you know, emaciated cheekbones, silver candelabras, nightgowns that show just a hint of ankle. It was a good semester? The greatest thing about it were the A's I got. I met a guy, lost a guy, you know usual. Do you want to- - Talk about it? Absolutely not. The only man I want for Christmas is you, sweet Greyson sitting in the front seat of this car. Come on, get a shake on, we got places to go, people to see. I thought we were just going to dinner. Yeah dinner, not just dinner. Besides, you're in desperate need of a wardrobe change. What? Greyson, I say this to you with all of the love in my cold dead heart. You look like a homeless IT guy. This is a nice sweatshirt. Again, no such thing. Besides, need I remind you that you haven't seen Sloane since the summer. So? Hot straight people are exhausting. Look, I have too seen her since the summer, we Facetimed once in September. Get in the car. ♪ I don't want a little puppy ♪ ♪ I don't need no fancy car ♪ ♪ Promise me one small thing ♪ ♪ You will be my Christmas star ♪ Ugh, I thought Michigan was cold. Nothing like Christmas in Connecticut. Personally, I kind of missed it. The numb hands or the icy lungs? Both. You are so weird. There they are. Stunning as always. Speak for yourself. It doesn't mean I wasn't addressed to myself. There he is. Mrs. Everdeen. Ugh, I saw the videos on Instagram. You totally slayed. - Shut up. - But I need the bootleg too, girl, where is it? Oh my gosh, I actually do have one clip from rehearsal. You'll have to see, I optioned up. Ugh, I'm salivating. Well I guess some things never change. Thank you. You're welcome. ♪ It's Christmas time ♪ ♪ Grab your coat, it's getting cold ♪ Callie, since when are you a beer drinker? I mean I'm only doing this because my New Year's resolution is to be more butch. UMich Is still a state school. I tailgate now. Ooh, plot twist. Party don't start till the MT kids show up. I once met this football guy that I could beat him in a keg stand and when he lost, I forced him to learn the opening choreography from "A Chorus Line". He was shockingly not bad. - Oh my God, did he wear the sparkly tights? - I wish but I did get his number out of it. Okay girl, I'll drink to that. Ooh, to the only friends from high school, I can still stand to be around. You guys make coming back worth it. Cheers. I'm gonna miss it. What's that mean? My mom is moving to Boston. Ew, why? Well it's not until summer so Paige can finish middle school, but she wants to be closer to her parents and I don't know, it's not really my decision. Well, Boston's not that far. I know and it might as well happen now because we're all graduating but it does feel kind of seismic, you know? Kind of seismic? Isn't that kind of an oxymoron? I mean not all earthquakes knock you down. Some are just tremors. Okay Confucius. To new chapters then. May this one have a happy ending. All right. R.I.P. Sloane. Oh my God girl, I can see how you won that keg stand, jeez. Okay should we get another round, switch to hot toddies? I think I'm actually gonna call it here. The last three years have not been kind to my liver. - Ugh, lame. - Lame. - I have to get a head start on some Christmas shopping too. - Girl, that's on you. I have work tomorrow but I don't care, let's go. You got a job? Yes, I am in fact working at the famed Christmas carousel downtown. It's been super fun, but please come visit me because it's just as boring as it sounds. Isn't that the place where our high school acapella group went caroling? Oh my God, yes where you did that iconic rendition of "Oh Holy Night" Exactly. I think it's still on YouTube somewhere. Oh my God, pull it up, pull it up. I'm gonna head out with you. Okay. I hope the crowds are not too much to handle tomorrow. I'm not stressed about it. My mom's just showing the house tomorrow so I want to get back beforehand so I can get Paige out of the picture. She basically accosted the last family for their color design choices. Shh. I can watch her tomorrow if you want, makes it less stressful. You don't have to do that. No, I want to. 'Tis the season, right? Yeah okay. Good? Yeah. I'm down there. So anything I should know about Paige? What are you talking about? You've met her before. Yeah, but not with this level of responsibility. Does she have a peanut allergy, favorite song, a specific emotional trauma I should do everything I can to avoid? Well, I mean- - Right sorry. Don't be. That was really stupid. It was a long time ago. - Why would you remember? - No, it's not that I forgot, it's just- - It happens. - Not with her. Not tomorrow, I promise. It's not like we don't talk about him. She's not gonna break if you bring him up. I will tread lightly, sorry. You're fine. It's really good to see you, Sloane. It's really good to see you too. Familiar faces are kind of a hot commodity these days. Yeah. Yeah I feel like at school it's this like sea of faces, people that I recognize but don't like know. I mean I have guys that I hang out with, but it's not like we have roots, not like here, not like this. Sorry, I forgot, sorority queen, you probably have no idea what I'm talking about. Oh no, I do, trust me. The drunken rebels were fun, but honestly I'm kind of looking forward to a quiet Christmas. Salute's still open I think if you want to maybe get another- - Oh I would but Paige is actually waiting for me. We read Christmas stories to each other every night the week leading up to the big day. Dad used to do it with us so- - Totally. She's up late. Yeah, total night owl. The hot chocolate obsession I'm sure has something to do with it. Right I know that life. I'm that way so I can just see you in the morning. Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow. Cool, tomorrow. Oh, what do you want for Christmas? I'll see what I can muster up while I'm out tomorrow. Surprise me. You're asking for it. How come we can't just do content that's like based around our shimmering personalities, you know? Well, if we want it to go viral Henry, we have to make something that's eye-catching so that stop scrolling and actually watch. Okay, but see like this choreography, it's all arms. I'm gonna end up looking like one of those flailing inflatable tubes that's at the car dealership. Exactly, eye-catching. Fine. Can we at least give them vocals or something? Oh, like an intro? - Mmm yeah like an intro. - I love it. Okay so what if it's, "Hey there TikTok", Hallelujah chorus major third and I'm on top? Okay but you're, I'm never on top. Okay, you can be on top. Great. Okay so it's like ♪ Hey, hey ♪ ♪ Hey there TikTok ♪ - Booked. - That's the one. - Yeah. - Yeah. Nailed it. Can we get one more round please? Oh, yeah. Oh you're closing? Sorry. ♪ Make your list and check it twice ♪ Greyson, sweetie, how are you? Hey, Mrs. Peterson, long time, no see. Too long. Come here, give me a hug. I like that jacket. Thank you. Come in, how's school? It's good. Accelerating. Uh, too fast, I know. It only seems to speed up as you get older. I mean it's Christmas again already. I'm noticing. At least when I'm here though, it feels like I can press pause if that makes sense. It's always been the same for me, familiar roads and unfamiliar time. Want one? Oh, I'm good, thanks. I'm hoping Boston will also, oh I'm assuming Sloane told you? Yeah, she did. Still not sure it's the right decision, but it's a time of transition and it just seems to be where the inertia's taking us. I'm sure you wouldn't be doing it if it wasn't the right move. You want to hear a secret? Sure. Life never stops feeling like a test you haven't studied enough for. You just get better at faking it. Mom, you didn't tell me he was here. Hey Greyson. Hey. We were just catching up. He's my friend too. It's after 10. Don't you have that showing in a few minutes? Oh my goodness, you're right. Greyson, I am sorry. I have to go tidy a few things. You're good. But if I don't catch you again before Christmas please have a merry one and tell your parents the same, okay? Absolutely. Paige is just upstairs. She's choosing her outfit. Naturally. Thanks again for doing this by the way. I'm getting better at the whole procrastination thing, but. You're actually saving me. I'd just be watching "A Christmas Story" for the 100th time so I should be the one thanking you. Oh my God, remember when you tried the tongue pull thing in third grade? Remember when I tried to actively forget that and you keep bringing it back to life every year? Yeah well don't give her any ideas. Ah, I wouldn't dream of that. Paige, he's here. Well he has to wait, I'm not ready yet. I'll go get her. I'll see you later? Yeah. Paige! Hold on, Sloane! I don't need a babysitter, you know? Oh yeah, totally, I just you know- - Wanted to hang out with a 10 year old? - I mean when you say it like that, it sounds kind of- - Are you worried I'm gonna tell my sister I didn't have a fun time with you? I didn't know that was the thing that might happen. Are you not having a fun time? I'm just like wondering, you can tell me. It's not like a big deal or anything. Wait, were you guys talking about me? Wait, what did she say? Just that her super sweet high school friend was gonna keep me company while she finished getting ready for Santa. Okay and did she say super sweet like super sweet or like super sweet? I don't remember. Do you want like a hot chocolate or something, jog your memories, is that gonna? No. Okay, how 'bout a carousel ride? Ho, ho, ho. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I want the hat. Two please. Greyson, come on, I want the hat. And a Santa hat if you have any extras. Hello Paige. Hello Henry. Unfortunately, we don't have any hats that match this one, but in the spirit of the season I suppose no one will really notice if- - If uniforms are missing? Hi Brynn, what a pleasant surprise, I thought you were on your lunch break still. I actually clock in on schedule. Hmm, imagine that. Here you go. Thanks. Okay I just want to go on record saying that it was my idea to give her the hat in the first place and now you're the one taking credit for it. God love her, our verbal warfare is the only thing getting me through this gig. Here. Oh God no. You sure? It's a carousel, Greyson. I don't work on commission. Right. Not lot the people here anyway, right? Yeah, never a lot of people here. It's kind of on its last legs actually. They're saying they might have to only open it part-time next year. Really? We loved this place when we were kids. Well times change, attention spans get shorter, VR gets better. Could you help me film this TikTok? Sure. Thank you. Yeah, take a few steps back, get like as much of the background as possible. Really helpful. I want to get the whole kind of depressing backdrop. I think it might, the proscenium, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, SAT word, love it. Small one, if you could take a step just to your right. What? Nothing. Thank you so much. Okay I'll give you like a quick five, six, seven, eight and then you'll hit the start, the record button, just like hold it down while I do it. I know what to do. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, you ready? I'm ready, are you ready? Alright, practicing this all day. I'm gonna kill it. Okay, five, six, seven, eight. Nope. Ugh, ah, oh okay, that was it, you can hit that. That's it, are we done? Yeah, yeah, yeah. - That was it? - That was it. - We're, that was it? - Yeah, I'll take the phone. Was it good? I don't want to hear, I don't want to hear a word out of you. Nice. Okay, we'll have Callie look at it. Here. You know what? We'll just take as many as you want, ride as many times as you want. We'll just have them run it until you're sick of it. How's that sound? Great. Christmas miracle. Christmas miracle. Louise! Hey mom. Sorry, I know you're busy, but I was just wondering do you think Paige would like a journal for Christmas? I was about her age when I started, yeah, yeah okay, sure. Yeah totally. I mean I was just thinking she might, yeah okay. I'll keep looking. I love you too, bye. Hey Paige. What's up? You have any idea what your sister wants for Christmas? I don't know, why? She said she was getting me something and I just don't want to- - Be that guy. Right, so in the interest of not being that guy, if you think of anything, just let me know. Okay, well what's your budget? My budget? Yeah, what's she worth to you? I don't think it works like that. I think it does. I think you're being a little commercialistic. What's that mean? Commercialistic means like you're equating money with value for, you know just let me know if you think of something, that'd be great. Okay, got it. - Is that it? - It's cute, but Renegade is like way old. Yeah, it's a throwback. Not quite. It's too new to be vintage, too old to be fresh. But it's seasonal. Right, the song choice, I got the Santa hat. Yeah, which helps, but- - No, you're right. What if I went full instagay and did it shirtless? I think we need production value. Isn't that what I just said? If you do it shirtless, you're gonna look even more like one of those inflatable tubes flailing outside a car dealership. Uh! I'm just saying, use the setting. Hmm. So what, pole dancing on a carousel horse? Oh my gosh, my friends and I actually took a class during reading days. It's like way harder than you think. They're like athletes. So that's a yes? No, no Henry, we need to control ourselves. Just because the internet is full of teenagers gyrating for clout doesn't mean we need to stoop to that level. Fair. Hey guys. Hey Sloane. Oh you can head in. They've been in there for like an hour. Thanks. Actually, my dearest Sloane, you wouldn't happen to know of any scenic/visually interesting locals in say a 15 mile radius, would you? It's for the TikTok. Oh, they decorate the golf course with Christmas lights. Ew, no too sporty. Fair. Oh, I'm sure you've heard of that museum where they have all the old Christmas carousel horses on display. I certainly have not, do tell. I have to grab Paige but Google it. I haven't been in a long time, but my dad used to take me when I was little. I thought it was pretty cool. I didn't think people cared enough about carousels outside seasonal shopping mall trips and problematic golden age musicals. Yeah, it sounds kind of terrifying. Perfect. - Pony? - No. - Diamond? - Nope. A reasonably priced skincare set? Yeah somehow I think she'd take that the wrong way. You know I do still have Christmas shopping to do if you guys want to keep hanging out. Sloane, why haven't you taken me here before? I don't know. It's so cool. Yeah it is pretty cool, isn't it? Yeah. How was she? Great. And how was he? Fun, really fun actually. I was impressed. Hmm, good to know. Clear your calendars, folks. We have a plan. For? Going viral by way of A Christmas lock-in. Sloane told us all about this museum that has these old carousel pieces in it. Ooh, is that the place where dad? Yeah, the vintage fireman exhibit. Anyway, we swiped the key from Brynn's office and I was thinking we could all meet up there later tonight. Cool, that sounds fun. Ooh, I want to go. I think this might be a big kid outing. No, no, bring her. Clearly she and Greyson are getting along. Not to mention Henry's social media instincts could use a little generational jewel. You could say that again. You can say that again. Shh. She's worse than you. Okay, your stuff's in the car, my stuff's mostly in the car in. In case you get hungry. I thought you were saving these till tomorrow? We've got plenty, plus Paige wants to taste test. It's a Christmas necessity. The snow should stop by midnight so you won't have any trouble getting out in the morning. I saw. Thanks for being cool with us doing this tonight. The museum used to do overnight lock-ins when I was a kid. Glad you two are getting the chance. Me too. Maybe Santa will come. Why would Santa come the night before Christmas Eve? Test run, Sloane, duh. Reindeer are drawn to similar creatures, like horses. Even wooden ones? Especially wooden ones. They remind them of like the toyshop. How do you not know this? All right, you two better get going. I'll see you tomorrow. Love you both. Love you too, mom. All right, let's go. Oh remember his helmet's there. Say hi for me. ♪ Hark how the bells ♪ ♪ Sweet silver bells ♪ ♪ All seem to say ♪ ♪ Throw cares away ♪ ♪ Christmas is here ♪ ♪ Bringing the cheer ♪ ♪ Too young and old ♪ ♪ Meek and the bold ♪ ♪ Ding-Dong, ding-dong ♪ ♪ That is the song ♪ - Hey. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey. It's just us? Henry already opened up, but we decided to hang back so your welcoming party wouldn't just be a bunch of horse heads statues, horse head statues. Noted and appreciated. Can we go in now? I'm freezing. You're wearing like three layers. I need hot chocolate. They got hot chocolate in here? I don't know. I think we'll have to ask Henry. This place is huge. You guys know where they are or should I give 'em a call? Oh yeah, they're- - Ooh perfect timing, we need someone to record us. This might be the one. Unique setting, check, gorgeous lighting, check. Simple but effective choreography, double check. Ooh. Callie, I'm gonna need you to do a full out on that please. I'm trying. Okay we gotta capture this moment quick. Sloane, if you could be a doll, take my phone, adore you as always, thank you so much. Maybe like a low angle. - Like down here? - Wait, no, no, no, no, hold on, I don't want to get a double chin. It's dramatic. It's social suicide. This was a mistake. Yeah. Excuse me, what was that Tiny Tim? I didn't think things could get any worse, but I'm honestly for you. And what, pray tell, makes you an expert on the subject, hey mambo? Sloane, could you please take this street urchin to some peripheral exhibit so we can finish our TikTok in peace? Henry, the blood is rushing to my head. I don't think I- - If you can go full out for a 10 out of 12 Callie, you can hold that tableau for 60 seconds. You know what? I'm gonna find the wifi for us. I'm sure you guys are gonna have this. Just watch them, make sure they don't hurt themselves. Have a great time. It's gonna be great. Yeah sure walk away, Greyson right when the stakes couldn't be any higher. I'll be there. Sloane, can I check the monitor please? Actually, I think he might be right. Paige, do you want to go on a quick tour of the museum, let these guys talk it out? Maybe we can film that when the dust settles. If that ever happens. Amateurs, both of you. Right Callie? Callie? Oh my God, Callie. Got ya. Holy sheet music, I thought you had passed out. So good, right? I did Juliet in scene study last semester and I had to control my breathing like that for a full seven minutes after the whole oh happy dagger business. Okay diaphragm work. Was Romeo cute? Not my type but Paris was a snack and a half. We love a good Paris. Yeah. See Paige when you've studied the classics extensively like Callie and I have maybe then we'll listen to your advice. Back to our ones. Okay, ready? Five, six, seven, eight. This one's my favorite. Oh yeah, why? 'Cause of her eyes, she looks so happy. You know it says here that there are two sides to each horse, the romance side and the apprentice side. Tell me more. "The romance side is ornately carved and beautifully detailed, the side the everyone looking from the outside sees." I think that's the side we're looking at now. I think so too. "The apprentice side is often cruder, less polished, some may even say imperfect. It is hidden from spectators and only viewable once the rider has boarded the carousel." I never knew that. Me either. You know, I liked both sides when I was riding today. Yeah? I liked that they were different. Oh, here's another sign. "Most people do not know that the carousel horse's belly is hollow. So when the animals are being restored, they often find interesting things inside making some people call them the original time capsules." Sloane? Hey. Okay Henry's pouting in the corner about me having to come and ask, but we need Paige's help. They always come crawling back. What's in it for me? $10 cash and an extensive cloud-based library of Broadway bootleg scores and librettos for any audition ever. I'll take the cash, but sheet music means nothing to me. I think I have a bag of Skittles in my purse. Fun size or full? Full definitely. All right deal. Uh bless up, thank you. Sloane, pray for them. Let's go. Aren't there better things to be doing than whatever it is you are doing? Plenty, but I'm kind of on a deadline. For what? Last paper of the semester. You're not done yet? I am inching my way toward the finish line. I thought I was gonna attack it this afternoon but- - Oh God Greyson, I could've handled things with Paige, you didn't have to- - I wanted to. And besides, I'm almost done. Cool. I'll leave you to it if you- - Oh no stay. I work better with the occasional distraction. What class? Theory of knowledge. Sounds pretentious. It is. Topic? What Christmas means to me. Don't. Seriously? It's not as easy as it sounds. I don't know, it seems kind of like a gimme to me. Well, you're a writer. Hardly. Sloane. Let me read it. Yeah, I'm good. Come on. It's a work in progress. Oh, it's a work in progress? Yeah, it's like work that I'm progressing on. Yeah, yeah, well unfortunately for you I wasn't asking. Sloane, we're not doing this right now. Maybe you're not, but I am. You're literally, my laptop! I literally have to submit this in like 30 minutes. How old is this, like a 2008? Do you even know where you're going? Okay careful, careful, sharp objects, pointy things. Why? If I accidentally impale myself you'll get your laptop back. But at what cost? Aw. Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, okay Sloane, what's it gonna be? You seem really concerned about this. Are you afraid I'm gonna find something incriminating? You know I think I'm actually a little bit more concerned about getting this paper in on time so I don't fail this class. Oh I didn't know you were doing so poorly that one paper could make or break you. Yeah, I think college has changed me. Bummer, your work ethic was one of your more attractive qualities. Ouch. Okay, okay, stop, stop, stop. Okay Callie, you look great, you look awesome. Henry, you need chill. You just kind of look like you're- - I swear to God you little rugrat, if you say I look like a flailing inflatable tube outside the car dealership, I'm going to- - Paige, save me! Quick, quick, quick, quick. Paige hi, tell your sister to give me my laptop back. Why, you got something that's gonna put you on the naughty list? No, definitely, that was no. Sloane, need I remind you of the numerous times you've chased me around the house in an adolescent rage every time I stole your diary? See Sloane, even a nine year old gets it. Nine and three-quarters. Sorry. Thank you. Want to tell me about the diary? Journal and don't push it, pal. You guys didn't break anything, right? Because if you did, it's gonna be coming out of my already very modest paycheck. Just their dignity. Thanks, how's your quest for social media stardom going? Uh. Less than optimal. You just said I looked awesome. It only takes one weak link. I really don't know how you and Donna put up with her. You gotta admit she knows her stuff. Unless you two want to join I really got to get back to work with Fred and Ginger over here. Solid reference. Yeah, for real. I pride myself on my good taste. Actually, that sounds kind of fun. Are you down for a study break? Yeah, I might not be able to be part of a full production number, but I think I can throw a little something into the mix. All right, hit me. Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. The stockings were hung by the chimney with care in hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there. And mama in her kerchief and I in my cap had just settled down for a long winters nap. Five, six, seven, eight. ♪ Away to the window I flew like a flash ♪ ♪ Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash ♪ ♪ To the top of the porch ♪ ♪ To the top of the wall ♪ ♪ Now dash away, dash away, dash away all ♪ Okay great. Henry, fall in, fall in, fall in. You guys are, you're not centered. Smile, smile. I don't think he can do that. Why? I just think he's not at UMich. Yeah, killing it. We should just turn it off and look away. Turn it off, where are we gonna go? Away. And energy and energy. Okay, okay I see, okay. That was good, that was good. She's embarrassing. What do you mean she's embarrassing? She's nice, I like Sloane. No kidding. What? Ooh, uh uh. Retake. Okay so it's like savage, savage, savage love. Does anybody else know it? Merry Christmas to all. And to all a good night. Nailed it, I think we got it, guys. That was it. I'm so out of shape. We need to do more Zumba. That was really hard. You're the one who's going to dance class every day. Hey Zumba's great, we should do that together sometime. How's my pulse? How's my pulse? Yeah are you okay? That was good. That was really good, guys actually. Yeah I think that was pretty, I think we did it. It didn't suck. Didn't suck, yeah. I have to go submit that paper but I think this is ready to post so I'm gonna give you your phone back. Here, go for it. You were the best. Whew, all right I already want to make another one. I'm gonna go see if I can find another spot. Oh girl you go ahead, I'll edit this one. And I think someone is crashing because of all that sugar they ate. Mmhmm. Mmhmm. If that thing goes viral, I want to get my royalties. This exhibit is so random. What do firefighters have anything to do with carousels? I don't know, similar time periods. Any of your dad's stuff here? The memorial plaques down at the station, but we visited a few times. He wanted to teach me about the brotherhood forged in flames. And I thought I was dramatic. He had an act for embellishment. I remember on career day in second grade, he kept cracking jokes about my head being on fire, said he was gonna bust out the hose. Oh my God, that's mortifying, I'm sorry. It was funny, no such thing as bad press. For you, I'm sure. You should've seen me my first semester, so rough. I actually never told you guys this, but there was time when I thought they were gonna cut me from the program. Can they do that? Most conservatories do at least once a year. Ours is every semester. You're kidding? That's showbiz, babe. God, I can't even imagine. 100 no's for that one glorious yes. Still putting yourself out there like that every day just to get turned down. It's really- - Brutal? I was gonna say brave. Really? Most people would probably say crazy. It's kind of the same thing, no? What do you mean? Running headlong into something so dangerous. It may seem beautiful in pictures and movies, but get too close and it burns. And sometimes when it's really bad, it destroys, nothing left but ash. Forget premed, you should have gone to school for playwriting. From the way you describe it, art school would not be my jam. My skin's not nearly thick enough. Look, of course it's terrifying. Every audition I go on, it's like is my outfit okay? Did I pick the right song? Are they just gonna cast some blue check Hollywood D-lister who can't even sing to begin with? But none of that stuff matters. All you have to do is know that you are good enough. You are, Sloane. And I'm not the only one who thinks so. A helmet might help in the meantime. My dad used to say that having a team that you trusted was better than any helmet. Well, you've got that too. And it won't change no matter how many times zones apart we are. Okay, I need a cute Instagram. Henry, story or grid? One sec, I'm looking at hot vintage fireman. Ah, my type. She asleep? Out like a light. Good. Henry and Callie? Impromptu photo shoot. Safe to say they'll be occupied until sunrise. That tracks. You all submitted? Yeah, timestamped 10 minutes to midnight, right under the wire. Thanks again for the distraction. Ah, anytime. It was fun there. Honestly, I don't know whether to be impressed or intimidated that you know that whole thing by heart. Oh definitely intimidated. I totally favor fear over love so- - Thought so. How's Paige feeling about the move? She's okay. She'll miss her friends, but she's always been good at rolling with the punches. Totally. What about you? The move, how are you feeling about it? I don't know. I haven't really thought about it. Weird, I guess. Yeah. I mean, it doesn't really affect me, right? Like it shouldn't affect me, but I mean- - Why? Why what? Why shouldn't it affect you? Because I don't live here anymore, not really. Well, it's your home. Yeah, but what does that even mean? Home? Yeah. It means home I guess, I don't know. Dictionary will be able - to edify. - Seriously? Yeah, of course. In or out Sloane, come on? Fine. All right, here we go. Okay, "Home, one's place of residence." Not so much. Okay, one's place of origin. Closer. Okay, alternate definitions include relaxed and comfortable, in harmony with one's surroundings. Mmhmm. And on familiar ground. Well, I guess if we're going with that definition then I'm feeling kind of sad. Sad? Yeah, sad. Yeah same. What? What? Come on. Uh uh, it's nothing. Well, if it's nothing, you might as well say it. I'm just gonna miss you. Why? Why? Yeah I mean we only see each other a few times a year, we both have lives, - what's there to miss? - Sloane! What? I told you last night it's like a sea of people, faces. Yeah, yeah, but you must have friends. Of course I have friends. I'm not. They just don't, you make me, you, you make me feel um relaxed and comfortable, in harmony with my surroundings and on familiar ground. Same. Really? Yeah, really. Why is that so hard to believe? I mean you mean same like oh that's really sweet, same, that's really- - I mean what you mean. You know the carousel's the place I realized I was in love with you? I... Did not. Yeah well it's a true story. We were sophomores and it was Christmas time obviously and you were there with Paige and your mom and your dad and we'd just gotten out last day of school before break and you had done this like crazy presentation in world civ, totally crushed it. I fell on the floor, it was intimidating and I was like I don't know I was like reeling from it. And then I saw you at the carousel and you just looked effortless like it had never even happened. And you were in this red sweater and black skirt and your hair was in this braid, I really don't know why I'm telling you this. Yeah you do. Why didn't you say something before? I didn't know what it was. And when I did it was just never the right time. I remember that night too, you know. You were in a penguin suit. Why would I be in a tux? No, a onesy, a literal penguin suit like Paige's fuzzy thing. So stupid, I was so weird. Yeah, you were. I thought it was kind of cute. Yeah? Yeah. Hey kiddo, what's up? I think I heard Santa Clause. What do you mean you heard Santa Clause? I heard a bunch of noise. He was coming from the chimney. Let's go check it out. This way? Yeah. It's Christmas magic. He must be close. I can't believe we missed him. That Kris Kringle's slippery. That's how he gets down the chimney. Don't be ridiculous, Sloane. He adjusts his molecular structure using an unprecedented combination of Christmas magic and elf technology. It puts NASA to shame. I can't tell if it's a good thing or a bad thing that you grew up with the internet. Excuse me, I'm not the one who spent all night making amateur TikToks. I gave them pointers and they didn't even listen. Sounds about right. I'm glad we did this. Will you stay with me until I fall asleep? Always. Hey, Greyson. Hey, I was hoping you'd find me. Listen, I think we got a little carried away back there. Sorry, did something just happen? No, nothing. I was just thinking that we- - 'Cause we just said- - Yes. And we? Yes, we did. Am I that bad of a kisser? Greyson, come on. Sorry I just thought you were following me for the exact opposite reason. I know. I get it, I'm sorry, I just, I think it's better that I get this out now. Get what out? I can't do something right now. I can't be anything. I'm not asking you to. You kind of are. How? What did I? Greyson, you just told me that you're in love with me. I didn't, Sloane no, like no, like I meant like- - I know what you meant. Great, so we're on the same page? I mean what you mean, that's what you said, we're good. I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry. You shouldn't have said that? I told you I got carried away. So you didn't mean it? That's not what I'm saying either. Okay, great, what are you saying? I'm saying I leave for winter term in less than a week and then senior spring and then summer and then I don't know a job or traveling, whatever. I do know that I don't want to offer something that I can't give you. How do you know what I'm looking for you to offer or what I want? You haven't asked me, we haven't talked about it. That's just it, Greyson, I can't talk about it. I can't have any distractions right now. There's too much at stake. I'm a distraction? Don't do that. Some late night Christmas hookup that's just gonna be the talked about? How can you even say that? This is how can you say what you're saying right now when you've talked to me about these guys that are, what did you say? They're just there, they're not great, but they're just here, right? Greyson, I had just lost my dad. I was figuring things out. Okay well it makes me feel like I'm not worth the time. It's not about you. Yeah but we just leveled with each other and now you're just trying to like snuff it out instead of just like let it breathe. Like why? Sloane, I just, I don't, Sloane, I really like you. I like you, too. Okay, great, so what's the problem? I'm sorry. Okay um, I'm gonna go to bed. Greyson? Sloane, this isn't going anywhere. And I don't want to be a distraction so I'm gonna go to bed. Mmm, she's finally awake. How's the view count looking? Less than stellar. What? Are you kidding me? You post all of it? Yeah, I copied and paste all the hashtags you told me about including FYP and all variations of it. Ugh, damn it. I thought I was a drama major. Yeah, well I thought that app was supposed to be designed for people to go viral. Maybe people are just busy with family time. Henry, come on. Hey, hey, where's the fire? I got to go do some last minute Christmas shopping. On Christmas Eve? Yeah, it kind of slipped my mind. Just call me and we can- - At this rate, all that's gonna be left are socks and prepaid gift cards. We were supposed to get brunch. Someone's got coal up his butt. Hmm, I mean the guy schedules his bathroom breaks in iCalendar. There's no way he would have put off Christmas shopping this late. Sloane, you good? Yeah I just, I didn't sleep well. I'll be sure to let Brynn know the accommodations could use some work. Paige is getting crabby. Can we maybe do brunch another day? I'm pretty sure Greyson's going back the 26th, right? Well then, I got to go, text me? Okay fine. You know, this would actually be a super cute idea. Airbnb the place at night and during the off season. It's kind of a niche stay. That's one way to put it. Come on, there are people who pay out the nose to stay in hotels that are supposedly haunted. Fair point but carousel enthusiasts, do those even exist? It's the internet, you never know. All right, let's go, I'm starving and I was promised diner pancakes. Or what if, hear me out, since our lamer halves are MIA, we check out that new gastro pub downtown? I hear they do bottomless mimosas. A man after my own heart.

Yeah, yeah, it was fun. You still there? I thought you'd be home by now. I'm at the high school actually. Didn't know if one of the doors would be open. Greyson, do you know what day it is? Yeah, yeah, I know it's Christmas Eve. I just thought one of the custodians might be around and I was feeling kind of nostalgic. You could always go to the track. Walks there always clear my head. Yeah maybe. Just spitballing, you know me. Yeah that's a good idea, thanks. Listen, just be home by 4:30, okay? Yeah, I'll see you guys in a few. All right buddy. See you soon. Bye. ♪ Fall on your knees ♪ ♪ Oh hear the angel voices ♪ ♪ Oh night divine ♪ ♪ Oh night, oh night divine ♪ ♪ Oh night ♪ ♪ Oh night divine ♪ You are so predictable. You know that right? Homework on the bleachers the day before break? Yeah well you know I like getting ahead on stuff. Clearly. I wanted to give you this before in class, but I didn't get a chance so here. Sloane, I didn't- - Promise me you won't open it until Christmas. I didn't know, I didn't get you anything. That's not what it's about. That's very nice of you. It was my dad's idea partly. What is it? That question kind of defeats the purpose of the exercise, Greyson. Could you give me a hint? I could. But you won't? No. Okay. Well tell him I said thank you. I will. He likes you, you know? You good, bro? Yeah, I was just- - Reminiscing, huh? Spacing out. A lot of memories tied up in this place. Sorry, when did you graduate? Doesn't matter. You got somewhere to be tonight? Yeah. That's good, that's good. Everyone deserves somewhere to be on Christmas. Take care. Oh, back again? Free ride or seven? Maybe just two. Actually, I'm looking for Henry, is he around? Brynn, I don't get why I have to brush every single one of these horse's tails? They're not even alive. Oh, Hey Greyson. Hey. I didn't expect to see you here. I thought you'd be too busy checking items off that massive last minute Christmas shopping list that you just so happened to remember this morning before I immediately departing without further explanation leaving your best friends Henry and Callie wondering what could have possibly elicited such a strange reaction after what was for all intents and purpose a perfectly delightful Christmas activity. Yeah about that, um, I'll leave it running. Please. After you? Okay. I felt like it was like cotton candy or something, like it was gone as soon as I had it. Okay, if you're gonna commit to using a simile, you need to at least make sure that it's a good one. Maybe like the wisps of a cumulus clouds, soft and beautiful but never quite there. Please stop. Sorry. It sucks, I get it. Yeah, it does. Sloane is Sloane, buddy. You knew what you were signing up for. I thought you were rooting for us. I'm just saying that it's not personal. Don't look too much into it, it's not about you. Of course it's about me. If it wasn't about me, she wouldn't be icing me out like this. That's stupid. How is it stupid? Because it's wrong. Enlighten me. Okay. This behavior the both of you are exhibiting is textbook anxious avoidant attachment style. I would know, I do the exact same thing. You remember that guy I told you about when I picked you up at the train station, the Mr. Met a Guy, Lost a Guy? Yeah. First off, before I tell you this do not tell Callie I told you this because she would kill me if she knew that I didn't tell her first, cool? But, me and this guy were in each other's DM's for like weeks before we finally went out and we did and at the end of the night he kissed me. And then the next day I dipped, like fully disappeared, I was like the ghost of Christmas yet to come like literally. Why? Because it's scary, Greyson. Okay, how is it scary? What is so scary about- - About feeling like you have to be something to someone? She doesn't have to be anything - to me. - Yeah logically you get that and I'm sure logically she gets it too, but we're not talking about logic, we're talking about feelings, specifically love, famously the most difficult feeling. Two very different things. Yeah the difference with us is like nobody was in each other's DM's. We talked once in September, I told you. Yeah but you've known her for how long, dude, like 14, 15 years? How many lingering glances held for two seconds too long across the table was that or how many friendly hugs with a hand in the hair? Stop, stop. No, no, shut up, Greyson, we all know it. Our entire high school experience was filled with this nauseatingly will they or won't they? Just do something, okay, I'm losing patience. So you are rooting for us? Obviously. Okay so what do I do? Have you thought about what you're gonna get her for Christmas yet? Mallow me. Thank you. Here comes the hot chocolate. Watch out, it's very hot. - Thank you. - You got it? Thank you and marshmallows. Mmm. I'm sorry we didn't get a real tree this year. Mom. I just had to say it. It's okay, we know, it's okay. I like this one better anyway. It stays green longer and its less of a mess. I just always want Christmas to stay the same for you girls. It seems like it's getting harder and harder to do that. Mom, even if it doesn't that's okay. Things are changing, things have changed. I think if we try to fight that, if we pretend it's not happening, we're just gonna keep being haunted by the- - Ghost of Christmas past? I was gonna say memories but that works too. But that's just it's Sloane. These memories, our memories, I want them to stay special. I don't want you two to forget. I don't want to forget. And we won't. Dad's always gonna be with us. I'm just saying you can take the pressure off yourself. Yeah mom, it doesn't always have to be on the romance side of the horse. What? It's a carousel thing. You wouldn't understand. Delivery? Huh, I'll check. You getting tired? Should we go to bed soon? Not really. Who was it? Secret Santa. - Ooh. - Hi. Hello. Hello. Thank you for rescuing. I've been bored out of my mind. Both my mom and dad are already passed out on the couch. Eggnog and Bing Crosby on vinyl will do that to you. You know them better than I do. You sure I'm like keeping you from? What charades with Aunt Judy? Please, I will take any excuse to escape from that, trust me. Get anything good? Oh no, we don't do presents until tomorrow. Besides, I already know I'm not getting what I want, a TikTok that has actual numbers isn't something you can put inside a box. Henry. Callie, we both know the best way to get serotonin is through what? Strangers validating me on the internet. It was just supposed to be something fun to do over break. Why are you obsessing over it so much? Because I don't get to do it anymore, you know performing, finding an audience. You're the only one of us who was ballsy enough to follow her dreams or whatever. All right, it's not all it's cracked up to be just for the record. I know but I just miss it, that's all. And I remember once you told me about how auditions were like speed dating and you had to make the casting director fall in love with you just a little bit. And then Greyson came by tonight while I was closing up at work and he told me all about his saga with Sloane. Ooh, are they official? No, it's been exhausting. But it was a cute little reminder for me that in three and a half years of college, I haven't been able to hold onto a guy for more than a month. So I don't know, I've just been thinking about that a lot, figuring out how to get people to actually want to be around me. Hey, there are people who do. You guys don't count. We've literally known each other since grade school. Exactly, it takes time. No matter how many followers you have, they'll never know you like we do. The best parts and the weirdest. If you ask me they're kind of the same thing. Wait, that's it. What? I'm swiping Brynn's key, we're heading back to the carousel museum. Henry, no, I don't want to do any more TikTok dances. No more dances but just trust me, okay? I think I have an idea. I just want to put it out there that when it comes to clandestine Christmas Eve meetups this is a little on the nose. Regifting old carousel tickets, it's cute. Yeah, glad you could take a hint. Totally. I mean it would have been really awkward if you showed up waiting for someone and stayed in the cold for hours and they didn't show. I'm not looking to make some big declaration or anything. I just don't want to pretend that there's not something there or hasn't been. Merry Christmas. Open it. I went through all my old journals since middle school. I found every mention of you big or small and transcribed them so they're all in one place. Don't read them all right now. Some of them are legitimately embarrassing, but it has been there obviously. Your paper was really beautiful. Thank you. If you split infinitives and some tired metaphors. Yeah you know somehow I can't help thinking that's kind of your fault. I don't normally have to go chase my laptop down during my peak metaphor writing hours. I don't know, I feel like I was more of an inspiration than an obstacle. Yeah, I guess that's fair. Hey Sloane. Hmm? I know we're not gonna like date right now or whatever, but whatever this might be, I just don't ever want it to get heavy again. I don't know, I'm feeling pretty relaxed and comfortable. On familiar ground? I'm gonna kiss you now. Yeah okay. Uh finally. Come on. Where did you guys come from? Oh behind the tree. What? We were hiding, waiting for someone to make a move. Okay guys that was like really gross, ew. Honestly agreed but now that you two turtle doves are all patched up, we have some news of our own. Big news. We went viral. We did it. You did? Big time. Yeah, 500,000 views and climbing. Duets are off the charts. Comments asking where the museum is so people can go check it out themselves. Yeah, so much for opening part time next year, right? How did you do that? That's amazing. Well to quote Callie, "You gotta lead with your best and your weirdest parts." And then Henry had the great idea of breaking back into the museum to record a highlights video of its eccentricities, no gimmicks. Turns out there are a lot of people into vintage Americana. Okay I don't know what that means but anything's better than watching your "Renegade". Does my mom know that she's here? Um we kind of kidnapped her but don't worry, we left a note so. Worst case we'll just shove her down the chimney before sunrise. Won't we, you little gremlin? It's midnight. It's officially Christmas day. What do you guys say to one last spin on the carousel before Brynn realizes I stole her keys again? Paige, want to stay up and take a ride? Obviously. Yeah, let's do it. Yes, come on, yes! Judging by these texts, oh she already found out. I'm gonna get so fired. Merry Christmas, Sloane.

And were here at the Carousel Museum ranking all of the animals. Woo. He gets a 10 out of 10 for the jewels, but this guy, is he haunted? 666 out of 10. Is this guy a dog? Is he a dragon? We don't know but we love him anyway, eight out of 10. This is my absolute favorite one in the whole museum because it's the only one known to have been designed by a woman. So yes feminism, I'm giving this deer a 10 out of 10. This one's not an animal but she does look like my Aunt Judy so four out of 10. We love a sensible centaur. Nine spices out a 10. He may look old and scary but this dude has history. He was built in 1895 so four out of 10 for appearance, 10 out of 10 for value. Who doesn't love a camel? Four out of 10 for each hump, eight out of 10. Freedomstead, seven out of 10. Here we have flat Beth. She is beautiful and the oldest horse in the entire museum. 10 out of freaking 10. Gender might be a spectrum, gut this donkey here is the only one in the whole museum that's anatomically correct. For legal reasons, we can't show you though.
