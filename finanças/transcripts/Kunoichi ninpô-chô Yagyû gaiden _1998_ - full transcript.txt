Long, long ago... ...on a small island in a corner of Asia, there was a warlord. This warlord was very fond of women... ...and used his status to procure whatever he pleased... He killed all those who opposed him. One day, a vassal refused to let the warlord have his way. The warlord was taken with the vassal's beautiful daughter. When he tried to make her his own... ...the vassal fought back and took his family and left the province. Enraged, the warlord ordered the entire family to be killed. He fell further into a life of debauchery. This is where our story begins... What are you going to do? Shut up. A convent, where men are forbidden... A women's sanctuary... Guards, guards! Stop. Father! You thought you'd be safe if you hid in a convent? Not a chance. Bastards, you're going to slay the nuns? Ninja magic, Eye Balls from Hell! They are demons! They are devils! Yes, we are devils! We are demons! We shall make this place hell for those who are disloyal to our Lord! Cry! Scream! All that's left are these girls. It's a shame to kill them. Spare Ochie. The Lord wants her alive. Get out of the way. You'll have to kill me. Who are you? I am the matron of the Tenshuu Convent. But this convent is Lord Hideyori's... Correct. I was once married to Hideyori Toyotomi. Princess Sen! That is correct. She is Princess Sen of the Tokugawa clan. You knew my daughter was the matron of this convent... ...yet you violated this sacred place. We are from the Katoh clan. Even if we have to risk the future of Aizu... ...we will bring the remaining seven women to justice. Wait. You'll risk the future of Aizu? Interesting, take your chances. With my life... ...| will defend this convent. Even if it means defying the shogun... Please forgive our sins. Let's go. Ochie... Let them go for now. I hope you know why. Yes, we do. The Hori clan were once lady ninjas... The time has come, awaken your powers! Yes! Kunoichi The Lady Ninja Yagyu Gaiden Kunoichi The Lady Ninja I've never been in a convent. Neither have I. But these women have been sullied. It doesn't matter how many men enter. True. Gentlemen guests must wear these in the convent. This way, please. Just like cats, huh? Ordinary robbers will not attack a convent and kill nuns... It takes a beast to kill another beast... Are you calling me a beast? Master Takuwan has arrived. Forty four... I thought 23 women were killed... Yes, and 21 men were killed, including Mr. Hori. I see. Revered Monk. We're in need of your help. Lord. Enter. Kyoto dolls for the year... ...have been brought by the administrator Jinemon from Yoshiwara. Nobility's daughters, I hear. Interesting. Make the purchase. Listen, Revered Monk... You may prepare these girls... ...and defeat the seven beasts of the Katoh. We want you to destroy Aizu. Introduce yourselves. I am Ochie. I am Osawa. I am Oshina I am Okei. I am Sakura. I am Otori. I am Ofue. Now you know why I brought you here. Interesting. Don't be so amused. You can only help them, the girls have to kill them by themselves. It will not be easy. I'm even more amused. What did you say? It's a waste of time asking him! If you are afraid of the beasts, you can leave! We will defeat them by ourselves! We're talking to you, remove your hat! You try. I will! I see. The rumor was right, the Hori women are hot-headed. Let me go. Let me down! Can we really count on him? Look. The bells on his waist... They aren't ringing. Revered Monk. What is this samurai's name? How rude of me, please forgive me. Let me introduce him... Princess, he is the first son of Master Tajima Yagyu. So he is... Jubei Yagyu himself. As expected... ...the Hori women had already disappeared from the Tokei temple. I see... There are three men... We must be careful. Who's there? He is good... Wait. Look. Seven targets left Come on in. Why do we need bamboo baskets? It's better than nothing. He's hopeless. We shouldn't depend on him. We should do it our way, we're going to die anyway. Probably. Why don't you stop eating and get serious? Want some? No! Here are the newly acquired Kyoto dolls. They are the daughters of nobility. Are we being married into the Katoh family? That's right. Please spare us. We do not want to die! What? The brides of Katoh will be murdered. Who did this? You all need to relax. You're making me tense. Would you like a massage? That sounds good. Listen Ochie... You should soften up. Then we won't be able to defeat them. You're too uptight. You are too soft. I guess. Come out, Hori bitches! You cannot hide from me. Self-replication magic... Die! Ninja magic, rotting egg! Your body will rot from the inside out... It will be a slow and painful death! Ofue! Ofue! Hang in there! Ofue! Her bruise is getting bigger. I'll tend her. Ofue... Ofue. Ofue, hang in there. No use. Only the man who cast the spell can undo it. So Ofue is... It's awful... Kill me. We gave up everything... ...and sworn to be Kunoichi. So... ...| don't want to be a burden to you. I would rather die with dignity. No point in killing your comrade. I promise to help you seek revenge. Until then, just concentrate on staying alive. Ochie. This is reality. Do not run from reality. Do not be defeated by reality. Don't move! So you are Hano ya. Hano ya! You won't get away like the other day. Take off your mask! Take it off and show yourself. If you beg for your life, I will let you live. No thanks. I don't want to become a Kyoto doll. Ugan! Die! Now! Behind you! Impossible... Five targets left... Magobei! You should be worried about your own well being. Stop! So you are Hano ya... Show me what you've got. When the time is right. We shall meet again. I'm looking forward to it. Jump! Wait! Enough. Five targets left Damn! Fools! What the hell are you doing? You still can't find those Hori women? If... If you are prepared to make an enemy of Princess Sen... ...there is a way to kill Hano ya. Fine! Do it In the name of my land, Aizu! What are you going to do? No! Somebody is leaving tortured grooms by Takebashi gate... ...Spreading bad rumors about the Princess. People are saying that Princess Sen is a vicious whore who sends men to hell. This is definitely the work of Katoh's men. Akinari must have taken the brides. That's likely. And you plan to do nothing? They are trying to lure us out. Then let's give them what they want. We could set a trap... They've already set a trap for us. But we cannot just sit here and wait. Do you have a plan... ...Master Jubei? Master Jubei? They only take brides and grooms... Shall we have a wedding? Huh? Osono. Yes. Where are you? Right here. Come. Master Gentatsu... You still have your hood on? I have an unsightly bruise on my face. No need to worry. I am blind. Besides, Osono... ...we are now man and wife. Master Gentatsu... Hey... Sakura. Here they come. Are you awake? You are quite stubborn, aren't you? Women here never want to leave. Do you know why? This place is like a paradise for women. Lord. What is it? It's about the groom downstairs. What is going on? Is he really asleep? Wake up! I said wake up! Lord! Don't move... ...or he will die. Do you know that you are holding the lord of Aizu as a hostage? No wonder... He reeks of death. Who the hell are you? Guess. Let him go! Who's this? Sakura from the Hori clan. If you don't let him go... ...I will kill this woman! You want to exchange the life of a woman for your Lord? Wait. You, Monkey. Let her go. I win. Stay together until we get to the gate, then scatter and run. Now go! Hurry! They're all out. Good. Let's go. Where are we going? To the gate. What? I feel bad that people think Princess Sen is involved with all these nobodies... He is a horse's ass, but the Lord of Aizu will make for better rumors. You are mad! Walk. Rensuke! Find the women first! Don't let them get away! Lord, everything is under control. Who is he? How could a blind man... I've never heard of a man like him. Could it be... ...Hano ya himself? Are you okay? Yes. They got us. What is this strange smell? Hano ya! Are you alive? You're as good as dead. Look around you! You're dead! Even you cannot get out of this hole! Has he lost his mind? Bastard! You will pay for this! Master Jubei... Please make love to me. It is said that if you drip the blood of a virgin of Hori on a sword... ...the blood splatter can cut through a man. What? I have not awoken my true ninja powers yet... ...So I do not know if my blood will work. But you encouraged us to live on when we were ready to give up our lives. Get in! Get in! Get in! There were ten women... What? We must find them. Five are missing. Isn't that them? Oh, I forgot about the women he slept with... Wake up! Forget them! Where are Koshichiro and Ginshichiro? They've gone to abduct more brides. Lord! What? They are having sex down there. What? How dare you! Ouch! Did you get hit? No, that's not it. Damn you! How can I not hit him? Oil! Bring the oil! Master Jubei! May you burn in the flames of hell! Ninja magic, red phoenix! Don't move. Don't move, or you'll be dead. Who are you? Hori women? They had switched with the brides. Go ahead! An arrow or two will not kill us! All we want is... ...the life of Akinari and no more. Use this rope. This is our revenge... We're paying you back! I've dreamed of this day... I missed you, Ochie. If you had become mine... ...no one would have had to die! Ochie! Don't move. I'll break their necks. Do you not care about your Lord? Do it if you can! You sure will pay for it! What's the matter? Don't you care what happens to these girls? Ochie! No! Don't worry about us! I'll kill her! No! Otori! Otori! What was that? It's a ninja magic... ...nipple shock wave. Good job... But you still need to work on it. We won't kill him yet. He is going to watch as we Kill the rest of his men, one by one... ...until his turn comes. Bow! This is Princess Sen of the Tokugawa. Show some respect! Are you one of the Katohs? Answer! No... I am not part of the Katohs. Then why are you wearing a robe with the Katoh crest? That's enough. We will drag him to the Katohs, and see if he is telling us the truth. Hiding in a Zen monastery... Not bad... Why, father? The Ninja blood should run thickest in me... Ochie... I'm sorry. I had no choice... What are you saying? If we make love with Master Jubei, will our powers awaken too”? I feel like I'm in my mother's arms... Would you play your flute for me? The sound of your flute calms me. No! Ochie has awakened! Ninja magic, hair storm! Four targets left Have you found them? No, sir. You are useless. I am going back to Aizu! We're leaving! We're leaving right now! Lord. This head... You want it? The Lord is leaving! Well done. Ofue? Why Ofue? We must tell Master Jubei... I feel like I have met you before. Let's not talk... ...my Lord... Koshichiro is headed to Aizu alone. What do you think our odds are, Jubei? Who knows... We won't know until we try. Look... ...how big our enemy's domain is... What is it? We're being followed. What? Don't look. Clever disguise. Ninja magic, energy ball! There you are, Hano ya. It doesn't matter how good you are... ...80 long as I have these girls! Die! Ouch! Damn you! Take this! Exploding energy ball! Run! Ninja magic, returning echo! What's that? Okei! Okei! Are you okay? Aizu... Aizu is burning. Entering Aizu Lord... I give my soul to you. I, Oyura, will be at your side from now on. I bring word. The Zen monk Takuwan wishes to pass through Aizu. What? Wait! I have not heard anything about this. Well... I'm on a personal journey, don't mind me. I smell women. Great Master Tenkai? Takuwan, sir... Let's have a look in those palanquins. I'm sorry, but I cannot let you do that. And why is that? These women are for the Shogun. Koshichiro... Cut open the palanquins. Akinari, who is this old man? Ashina Dohaku, he is my servant. Koshichiro! You're putting Aizu at risk! Stop! Go ahead, do it! If these are the women of the Shogun... ...| will guarantee that we will take full responsibility. Very well. Smoke signal! Where is he? Stop. It's a trap. Well, may I be on my way? Please forgive us. You are forgiven. Don't worry about it. Master Takuwan... Please forgive me. Let's go. So, Takuwan is on the enemy's side. This is getting interesting. Three targets left What? Rensuke too? Dohaku. Why did you let them go? There is nothing to worry about. They are like the birds in a cage. They will not get out of Aizu alive. More importantly... Edo has its pleasures... ...and so does Aizu. The entire domain of Aizu... ...and all of its people belong to you, my Lord. They are for your enjoyment. The members of the Hori clan are to be turned over immediately. We've heard that you are hiding fugitives. All members of this household, show yourselves! S this all? Yes, sir. You're lying! We know that a young girl lives here. That would be our daughter. Well, where is she? Well... She entered a convent. What? Stop! Master Takuwan... Men are forbidden to lay a finger on nuns! Let's go. Stop! What are you praying for? There you are. I'll get you! Did you really think... ...your childish trick would work for me? Okei! On guard! You! Damn bitches... You'll pay for this! Nothing is happening... Same here. Our powers didn't awaken... Are we going to die here? Oshina! After Oshina dies... ...it's your turn, Osawa. But if you die in her place... ...I might let Oshina go. What's it going to be? Let go! You're going to die! Oshina! You... You've finally awakened... Die. They're just women after all. Ninja magic... Hatching corpse! Osawa, Oshina! Women are continuing to join the convent, you say? Yes. Takuwan, he cannot be taken lightly. Lord Akinari is cursed. Koshichiro... Get 15 girls from the dungeon and chop off their heads. We will lure Takuwan out. Rebels are ordered to surrender immediately. So long as they are in our land... ...more deaths will follow among women. I cannot just sit back and let them kill more innocent girls. We will sneak into the castle and stop them. There is no guarantee that it will work! If we get killed... Shut up! Look who we are up against. We can make them believe that we surrender and fool them. More importantly, there's something I need to know. It's about Master Tenkai and Dohaku. They are identical and are both 108 years old... There must be something behind this... Otori. Okei. You two go to Edo. Find out the truth from Master Tenkai himself. But... Listen. It could be the key to bringing down Dohaku. It's an important mission. I understand. Here you go. Saved twice by two disloyal demons... ...saved by demons... They're here. Oh, foolish warlord... Oh, foolish warlord... Are you praying for your life? Master Takuwan. I'm not asking much... Please don't ask me anything, and return to Edo. That's asking a lot. I will give you my head in place of my Lord... ...In exchange for those of the remaining girls and Hano ya. I want the heads of Akinari and his two remaining men. Then I will take the girls and Hano ya and return to Edo. Those are my conditions. Are you not concerned about Tenkai? Do you not worry about what happens to the Tokugawa clan? What do you mean? Take a look. Master Tenkai! So Ashina Dohaku is... ...Master Tenkai's other half? Indeed. By an accident of nature, we are twins. If Dohaku dies... ...so will 1. So long as I am alive... ...Dohaku will not die. I am aware of the misdeeds of the Katoh clan. Dohaku lives for his desire to make Aizu the property of Ashina. I will write a proclamation of reconciliation. To us, reconciliation means losing the battle. I cannot die. I must remain alive... ...for the sake of the Tokugawa clan. I won't be defeated! My star shines brighter than yours! See for yourself. If I suffer, Tenkai will suffer, too. If I die, Tenkai will die, too. Which is more important to you... ...Tenkai or Hano ya? ...the Tokugawa clan or the Hori women? Call Hano ya and the Hori women to the castle. Our battle is lost... Hano ya and the Hori women are to be at the castle before sundown tomorrow. If you disobey these orders... ...you will be endangering the future of the Tokugawa clan. Good. And how will you send the message? What are you doing? The fire is burning... The fire in my blood... Jubei... ...come put it out! You cannot go alone. It's Takuwan's order. This could be a trap. Probably. You are going knowing it is a trap? That's right. What about us, he does not want us to come? No, the letter didn't mention you. Please, I would like to see the letter. I tossed it. I'm going. Please wait! I caused this battle... ...yet I am still alive... Now I regret that I did not give myself to Akinari when he asked... I don't want to... I just don't want anyone else to die! Don't worry. I won't die. And... ...I won't let anyone else die. Wait for good news. H-Hano ya! It's Hano ya! Hano ya is here! So that's Hano ya... That demeanor... He may be our enemy, but what a brave man he is... Dohaku, don't let him get any closer! Hano ya! Where are the Hori women? Hano ya! Master. It's all over... I need you to die. What has happened? We have lost. Dohaku and Master Tenkai are twins. And not just ordinary twins... If Dohaku dies, so will Master Tenkai. We must kill Dohaku to win... ...but we cannot let Master Tenkai die. Master Tenkai is the spiritual guardian of the Tokugawa clan. Master Tenkai cannot be sacrificed, we have no choice but to hang up our swords. You must understand. I will die, too. I won't do it. I refuse to let those women die for those reasons. I'm sorry. You will put Master Tenkai in danger. None of my concern. What are you saying? Master Tenkai is the foundation of- Master! Have you gone mad? What? Letting those women die does not follow the way of samurai, nor Buddhism. What would that make Master Tenkai? What would happen to the future of the Tokugawa domain? If we seek revenge, Master Tenkai will die... ...and if we don't kill those women, the Tokugawa clan will fall... Fine. Let Master Tenkai die. Let the Tokugawa clan fall! I had a feeling you would say that. No, I think I was hoping you'd say that. You heard him. Shoot! He's mine! Calm down. Take that mask off. I'm shy. Stop! Jubei Yagyu! I see. That's who you are... Shall we continue? Wait! I will fight you. You don't trust me? That's right. The Tokugawa crest... Jubei. Dohaku is immortal. That makes it more interesting. Is that it? Takuwan. I'm sure someone in Edo is in great pain right now. That rope was woven from women's hair. You cannot cut it with human hands. I can cut it if I want to. And what would you do? Do you think you can get out of here? I do. Let's see how long that conviction lasts. Yours, too. Why? Why do you let him live? Look what he did to me! He is the son of the Tokugawa sword master... ...Tajima Yagyu. Tajima is not just a sword master... ...he has the total confidence of the Shogunate. And there are rumors that Jubei is a secret agent. The slightest mistake could be fatal. Please leave it to me. Master Jubei. Master Jubei. Ofue? I anticipated this and snuck in. You... Princess Sen used her magic to slow down my illness. I see. But, it will not last for much longer. Master Takuwan... Master Takuwan! Master Takuwan. Master Takuwan. You came back? Yes. We will help you out. Don't mind me. Run. Do you hate me that much? I'd rather die than... ...let you have me. Then die! I will cut you to pieces! Lord! What is it? We've captured the rest of the Hori women, Otori and Okei. Master Jubei. Master Jubei. Ginshiro... Yes. Kill that woman. Ofue... Master Jubei... Please... Don't look... Go check. What is this, a demon? Behind you! Did you call her a demon? Apologize to Ofue in hell. Don't judge people by their looks. Isn't that right? Ofue... You will be executed at dawn... ...in front of the townspeople! Ochie... Ochie... He will... He will come. Master Jubei, let's run away together. I can set Takuwan and the women free... ...but only if you promise to stay with me forever. How dare you! Dohaku... Yura, come. Yura! I will not! I am carrying a child of the Lord. I will make the perfect hostage for Master Jubei. Master Jubei, come with me. No! Father, you cannot kill me. I carry the heir to the Ashina clan! Why? I am not your pawn! Master Jubei is my first love, he is a man among man... I will protect my true love! Damn you, Jubei! Master Jubei... Please pull out the sword from my body... Bastard! Hotaro... Hotaro Ashina, whom I shared the same dream in the same womb... I'm drowning in the cries of the pitiful women... I, Tenkai, choose death. Death shall be brought to the treacherous Dohaku Ashina. Heitaro! Farewell. It's over. Master Tenkai... Hold on'! This is my destiny. Please go. I am glad to have met you... Master... Please tell me. Why do I bring death? Jubei, go. Where is Dohaku? Where is Oyura? Someone go check! One target left Master Jubei! Get him! Get him! No need to rush. The time has come. Stay back! I have waited for this moment. I got him... Got who? Our battle is over. I have women to rescue. You forgot something. Huh? Otori! Ninja magic, nipple shock wave! Not this again! Okei! Ninja magic, returning echo! Burn! Burn! Let Aizu burn to the ground! Otori, are you okay? Is this... Ochie, take the sword! Ochie... Go! Get them! Come forward if you want to die. Where are you going? Someone! One head left to roll. Kill him! That's enough. Pops? As a representative of the Shogun... ...Princess Sen has come a long way from Edo to hand down Katoh's sentence. Show your respect for Her Excellency. Sentence me? That is correct. The crimes you committed in Kamakura... ...ignoring the rule of Buddhism, invading a convent forbidden to men... ...and slaughtering the nuns, including innocent men... This is a serious crime of the gravest nature. Your land will be taken away. You will be exiled to the country of lwami. Kill him. We finally did it... Now go. Thank you very much. Takuwan... How is Master Tenkai? I see... Tajima, don't be hard on your boy. If I leave him be, who knows what he will do. Not to worry. In times like these, the world needs a man like him. Where is Master Jubei? He was just there... Master Jubei... Master Jubei? Master Jubei! Master Jubei! Master Jubei! Master Jubei! Jubei... I thank you. You won't even let me thank you? I can't deal with my old man. Is he the only one you cannot deal with? Where will you go next? I don't know. But wherever it may be... ...it might be another bloodbath. This is goodbye then. Master Jubei... Nothing. Ochie... That's the first time you smiled. So long. Though evil still remains in this world... ...however, this story comes to an end. All's well that ends well.
