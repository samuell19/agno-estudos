Yeah you know, my name is Sunny, you know. That's, that's what my friend calls me. Your information here says Sunday. Yeah, you know the same way, you know Sunny aka, I mean, Sunday aka sunny. You know I actually blame my dad for that. He wanted me to be a priest. You know when I was a little kid, but as I grew up. As I became an adult, I, I just realized that you know priests Can't do something, you know what I'm saying. Save us the sermon, Mr Sunday. I'm just about To tell you something. it's okay. The job entails you picking up guest celebrities from the airports. Okay Driving them around to get something to eat. And while doing all of that we want you in your best hospitable behavior. So what makes you the best man for this job? You know I'm saying, um You know I'm Nigerian I was bought.. See madam eh, see, the matter is this, I be proper Auchi boy, you know. Edo. Nothing dey happen. Well eh, so many reasons. Number one, I've been driving since I was 12. Never got a speeding ticket. See this job, nothing. I hold ground. Never been arrested. And I don't use GPS's to get where I'm going, that's fake okay if I don't make my destination, it's not meant to be. All this movie .. is that not Jim lyke? Come on baby, I know him very well. All the film actors, the actress, the director The makeup artists, I know all of them. See. When it comes to Nollywood movie, I know all of them. So all these ones that will be coming from Nigeria and other parts of Africa I hold ground, nothing dey happen. Impressive! Impressive. However we need our chauffeurs to have background knowledge of our guests. Especially their celebrity status. That is a requirement. We are in luck because I know a lot about your Celebrity African actors. As a matter of fact, me and my friends host a little African movie night on fridays. You know we watch movies like stalker, 30 days in Atlanta Lion king. Lion king? Okay Mr Curry, our guests are people, not lions. Like I said before uh Growing up in Nigeria, the only thing that we watch in our house. You know way back in the days was Nollywood movies, you know? Because I know my father even had a colored TV, you know and there was this Particular one, Living in bondage. I'm sure one of you I don't know if you've seen it before, seen before, living in bondage. My father made us to watch that movie. Every Sunday for seven good years. I don't know why the man just, I don't know if he was living in bondage but we watched it for seven years. Perhaps because you were born on Sunday. I know a lot about uh you know Lagos, Ghana Bollywood Bollywood? that's India, this is Africa. This is America. No, I'm joking. Another joke I know it's called Nollywood The second most powerful film industry in the world. With celebrities like Genevieve Omotola uh you know Ramsay Noah, Jim lyke, who by the way I would like to personally drive around because I feel like I connect with him you know I read his bio and we kind of come from the same background so Mr Sunday what prior experience do you have that you're bringing to this job? Uh before now I used to work in um, in a call center you know, for an African restaurant, you know. So hold on hold on call center and african restaurants don't go together. Yes it's a call center, you know people call and you know they call, they tell me what they want to order then I write it down you know, call center you know so You mean you are the receptionist. Yeah, it's just not the english name you know for taking, you know that's, that's. we're saying the same thing. So call center, okay What prior experience do you have that you're bringing to this job? Well I mean, one time I drove from Houston to Tijuana Mexico and from Tijuana Mexico to Canada In 30 hours. why...? Because I was bored. Impressive, I mean let's just say that I don't fall asleep behind the wheel okay I can be awake for hours like I have red bull pumping through my veins. Once I step inside the car, I'm very zen Very calm. it's almost like the car and me become one person We're connected spiritually. Like right now, I am evolving. So what would you do in a situation one of our guest celebrity gets upset And pours all his or her frustration on you, how would you handle the situation? So one of your celebrity guests might yell at me for something I didn't even do. Yeah that's possible, possibly. Well okay, I pull over, calmly get out of the car. Open the back door and say, hey Mr celebrity. You're blaming me for that? Well guess what, you're not famous because you have 12 million followers on Instagram. We're all famous! Facebook bitch! I'm joking! No no no no no, I'm joking. It's a little joke. I do that a lot actually. You mean you do that a lot? No no no, not this. I joke a lot because I think my sense of humor And skills in making people laugh, usually! Would be good for this job, you know it gets boring driving around listening to The same podcasts and radio. Not just conversations, but to answer Your question, to ease your mind, if I do pick up one of Your celebrity guests, I promise that I'll be very calm, very zen And use my tiniest most peaceful voice like this. Hello Mr celebrity, I'm as a celebrity we're about To go to Giama! Giama, Giama! What's um, you don't think the voice is coming up? Whatever happens, we're still friends okay. This is what happens.
