[APPLAUSE] Thank you so much. [MUSIC - THE EVERLY BROTHERS, "CLAUDETTE"] (SINGING) Oh, oh, Claudette. [APPLAUSE] Oh, oh, Claudette. I got a brand new baby and I feel so good. She loves me even better than I thought she would. I'm on my way to her house and I'm plumb out of breath. When I see her tonight, I'm gonna squeeze her to death. Claudette, pretty little babe, Claudette. Never make me fret, Claudette. She's the greatest little girl that I've ever met. I get the best loving that I'll ever get from Claudette. Pretty little babe, Claudette. Oh, oh, Claudette. Well, I'm a lucky man. My baby treats me right. She's gonna let me hug and kiss and hold her tight. Oh, when the date is over and we're at her front door, when I kiss her good night, I'll holler, more, more, more. Claudette, pretty little babe, Claudette. Never makes me fret, Claudette. She's the greatest little girl that I've ever met. Get the best loving that I'll ever get from Claudette, pretty little babe, Claudette. Oh, oh, Claudette. When me and my new baby have a date or three, I'm gonna ask my baby if she'll marry me. I'm gonna be so happy for the rest of my life when my brand-new baby is my brand-new wife. Claudette, pretty little babe, Claudette. Never makes me fret, Claudette. She's the greatest little girl that I've ever met. Get the best loving that I'll ever get from Claudette, pretty little babe, Claudette. Ah, oh, oh, Claudette. Mm, mm, Claudette. Ah, oh, oh, Claudette. Mm, mm, Claudette. [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC - THE EVERLY BROTHERS, "WALK RIGHT BACK"] [APPLAUSE] I want you to tell me why you walked out on me. I'm so lonesome every day. I want you to know that since you've walked out on me, nothing seems to be the same old way. Think about the love that burns within my heart for you, the good times we had before you went away. Oh, please, walk right back to me this minute. Bring your love to me. Don't send it. I'm so lonesome every day. I want you to tell me why you walked out on me. I'm so lonesome every day. I want you to know that since you walked out on me, nothing seems to be the same old way. Think about the love that burns within my heart for you, the good times we had before you went away. Oh, please, walk right back to me this minute. Bring your love to me. Don't send it. I'm so lonesome every day. I'm so lonesome every day. I'm so lonesome every day. [APPLAUSE] (TALKING) Well, where you been? I don't hardly know what to say. I've thought and thought and thought, what's the first words I should say? And I just couldn't come up with anything other than-- PHIL EVERLY: It's good to be back. It's good to be back. [APPLAUSE] I'm Don. I'm still the oldest one. [LAUGHTER] Phil's catching up, though. Yeah, won't be long. Won't be long before Phil's as old as I am, I guess, if he keeps going. Anyway, we're happy to be here at Albert Hall. This is an occasion for me, I think, probably once in a lifetime that can happen to people. And Phil and I took our necessary vacation. And we enjoyed part of it and we hated part of it. And I think I can speak for Phil in saying that. And I think the question that's being asked the most now is, why in London? Why the Albert Hall? But this place has been special to Phil and I. One of our greatest memories is the night, over a decade ago, here at Albert Hall with our father. And my mom was there. And we had a wonderful evening here at the Albert Hall. And Phil independently thought of it. And I thought of it. When we decided that it was time to get back together and sing again, we both thought of London and the Albert Hall first. So that's why we're here. [APPLAUSE] We also knew you would be here, too. That's true. We didn't forget that. [MUSIC - THE EVERLY BROTHERS, "CRYING IN THE RAIN"] (SINGING) I'll never let you see the way my broken heart is hurting me. I've got my pride and I know how to hide all my sorrow and pain. I'll do my crying in the rain. If I wait for cloudy skies, you won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes. You will never know that I still love you so, though the heartaches remain. I'll do my crying in the rain. Raindrops falling from heaven could never wash away my misery. Since we're not together, I pray for stormy weather to hide these tears I hope you'll never see. Someday when my crying's done, I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun. I may be a fool. But til then, darling, you'll never see me complain. I'll do my crying in the rain. Raindrops falling from heaven could never wash away my misery. Since we're not together, I pray for stormy weather to hide these tears I hope you'll never see. Someday when my crying's done, I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun. I may be a fool. But til then, darling, you'll never see me complain. I'll do my crying in the rain. I'll do my crying in the rain. I'll do my crying in the rain. [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC - THE EVERLY BROTHERS, "CATHY'S CLOWN"] Don't want your love anymore. Don't want your kisses, that's for sure. I die each time I hear this sound. Here he comes. That's Cathy's clown. I've got to stand tall. You know a man can't crawl. When he knows you tell lies, hears them passing by, he's not a man at all. Don't want your love anymore. Don't want your kisses, that's for sure. I die each time I hear this sound. Here he comes. That's Cathy's clown. When you see me shed a tear, and you know that it's sincere, oh, don't you think it's kind of sad to treat me so bad, or don't you even care? Don't want your love anymore. Don't want your kisses, that's for sure. I die each time I hear this sound. Here he comes. That's Cathy's clown. That's Cathy's clown. That's Cathy's clown. [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC - THE EVERLY BROTHERS, "LOVE IS STRANGE"] Yeah! Woo hoo hoo. Lay on, yeah! Yeah! Looking good! Oh, love, love is strange. Lots of people take it for a game. Oh, once you've had it, you never want to quit. After you've had it, you're in an awful fix. Love is strange. Love is strange. (TALKING) Hey, Donald. What, Phil? Tell you what, if you were sitting around some very lonely spot, like the Holiday Inn, television's gone off, how would you go about calling your baby? You mean if I needed her real bad, Phil? I mean if you needed her real bad. - (LAUGHING) OK. - And I have-- DON EVERLY: I'll give it a go. Try to get two. I guess if I needed her real bad, I'd call her something like this. I wonder if it still works. (SINGING) Baby, oh, sweet baby, oh, my baby, please come home. - (TALKING) Yeah, that works. - Hey, what? That works. (SINGING) People don't understand. They think love is money in the hand. Once you've had it, you never want to quit. After you've had it, you're in an awful fix. Love is strange. Love is strange. Love is strange. [APPLAUSE] These are the words of a frontier lad who lost his love when he went bad. [MUSIC - THE EVERLY BROTHERS, "TAKE A MESSAGE TO MARY"] Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am. Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam. You can tell her I had to see the world. Tell her that my ship set sail. You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail. Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail. Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done. Please don't mention the stagecoach and the shot from the careless gun. You can tell her I went to Timbuktu. Tell her that I'm searching for gold. You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold. Oh, Lord, this cell is cold. Mary, Mary. [MUSIC - THE EVERLY BROTHERS, "MAYBE TOMORROW"] I know we'll love again, maybe tomorrow. I don't know where or when, maybe tomorrow, maybe tomorrow. You say, you say you're gonna cry because we had to say goodbye. Our love will stand their test of time. And the years won't be there to draw the line. I know we'll love again, maybe tomorrow, maybe tomorrow. [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC - THE EVERLY BROTHERS, "I WONDER IF I CARE AS MUCH"] Last night I cried myself to sleep for the one that makes me weep. I dried my eyes to greet the day and wondered why I had to pay. The tears that I have shed by day give relief and wash away the memory of the night before. I wonder if I'll suffer more. Oh, I wonder if I care as much as I did before. I wonder if I care as much as I did before. [APPLAUSE] (TALKING) Thank you. I think there was included a couple of songs you might not have heard us sing live before, even after all these years, in that particular group of songs. Here's one baby boy Phil wrote. (SHOUTING) One, two, one, two, three, four. [MUSIC - THE EVERLY BROTHERS, "WHEN WILL I BE LOVED"] [APPLAUSE] (SINGING) I've been lied to. I've been made blue. When will I be loved? I've been turned down. I've been pushed around. When will I be loved? When I find a new girl, oh, that I want for mine, oh, she always breaks my heart in two. It happens every time. I've been cheated, been mistreated. When will I be loved? When I find a new girl, oh, that I want for mine, she always breaks my heart in two. It happens every time. I've been cheated, been mistreated. When will I be loved? When will I be loved? When will I be loved? [APPLAUSE] (TALKING) How about a nice hand for Albert Lee here? [APPLAUSE] Martin Jenner. [APPLAUSE] Graham Jarvis. [APPLAUSE] Mark Griffiths. [APPLAUSE] Last, but not least, Pete Wingfield on-- [APPLAUSE] Thank you, everyone. [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC - THE EVERLY BROTHERS, "BIRD DOG"] (SINGING) Well, Johnny is a joker. He's a bird. A very funny joker, he's a bird. But when he jokes my honey, he's a dog. His joking ain't so funny. What a dog. Johnny is a joker that's a-trying to steal my baby. He's a bird dog. Johnny sings a love song like a bird, sings the sweetest love song you ever heard. But when he sings to my gal, what a howl. To me, he's just a wolf dog on the prowl. Johnny wants to fly away and puppy love my baby. He's a bird dog. Hey, bird dog, get away from my quail. Hey, bird dog, you're on the wrong trail. Bird dog, you better leave my lovey dove alone. Hey, bird dog, get away from my chick. Hey, bird dog, you better get away quick. Bird dog, you better find a chicken little of your own, yeah. Woo! Hey, Johnny kissed the teacher. He's a bird. He tiptoed up to reach her. He's a bird. Well, he's the teacher's pet now. He's a dog. What he wants, he can get now. What a dog. He even made the teacher let him sit next to my baby, the bird dog. All right. Hey, bird dog, get away from my quail. Hey, bird dog, you're on the wrong trail. Bird dog, you better leave my lovey dove alone. Hey, bird dog, get away from my chick. Hey, bird dog, you better get away quick. Bird dog, you better find a chicken little of your own, yeah. He's a bird. Yeah, he's a dog. You know what? He's a bird dog. [APPLAUSE] (TALKING) Now, if that song didn't make sense, this one's certainly not going to. [MUSIC - THE EVERLY BROTHERS, "BE BOP A LULA"] (SINGING) Well, be bop a lula, she's my baby. Be bop a lula, I don't mean maybe. Be bop a lula, she's my baby. Be bop a lula, don't mean maybe. Be bop a lula, she's my baby doll, my baby doll, my baby. She's the woman in the red blue jeans. She's the woman that's queen of the teens. She's the one woman that I know. She's the one woman love me so. Be bop a lula, she's my baby. Be bop a lula, I don't mean maybe. Be bop a lula, she's my baby doll, my baby doll, my baby. She's the woman that's got that beat. She's the woman with the flying feet. She's the one woman that I know. She's the woman that loves me so. Be bop a lula, she's my baby. Be bop a lula, I don't mean maybe. Be bop a lula, she's my baby doll, my baby doll, my baby. Oh, be bop a lula, she's my baby. Be bop a lula, I don't mean maybe. Be bop a lula, she's my baby. Be bop a lula, I don't mean maybe. Be bop a lula, she's my baby doll, my baby doll, my baby doll. [APPLAUSE] (TALKING) Thank you. Thank you so much. Just when I needed it-- Oh no, don't say that. People think you're getting old. [LAUGHTER] Oh. Well, you know, rock and roll is getting old. You never grow old with rock and roll. I agree with that. I agree with that. Rock and rock. And they said it wouldn't last. That's the part that thrills me most. [PLAYS GUITAR] Got any questions? [LAUGHTER] Yeah, what are we going to do next? AUDIENCE MEMBER: "Ebony Eyes!" No, no. We might get to that. Well, actually, the reason we've sat down here, I thought you might have some questions about if we made up, really, or if we're just doing this for some big thing here. We're friends again. We never really weren't friends, you know. [APPLAUSE] I think they deserve an explanation. Now, we actually sit down because we're tired. That's my reason. All right. We did an album a long time ago, probably one of our first albums. It's close to it. And the title of it was Songs Our Daddy Taught Us. And we want to do a few selections from that album for you. (SINGING) Twas in the merry month of May when flowers were a-blooming. Sweet Willie on his deathbed lay for the love of Barbara Allen. He sent his servant to the town, the town where she did dwell in, saying, "Master dear has sent me here if your name be Barbara Allen." Slowly, slowly, she got up. And slowly, she went to him. And all she said when she got there, "Young man, I think you're dying." (TALKING) Mine asked for my checkbook. (LAUGHS) [APPLAUSE] That song, of course, goes on and on and on. And there was quite a lengthy version of it on the record. But we thought we'd sing a few bars of it. We haven't sang that one in a long time, this one either. [MUSIC - THE EVERLY BROTHERS, "PUT MY LITTLE SHOES AWAY"] (SINGING) Mother dear, come bathe my forehead for I'm growing very weak. Mother, let one drop of water fall upon my burning cheek. I'm going away to leave you, mother darling. Please, remember what I say. Do this, won't you please, dear mother? Put my little shoes away. Santa Claus, he brought them to me with a lot of other things. I believe he brought an angel with a pair of golden wings. I'm going away to leave you, mother darling. Please remember what I say. Do this, won't you please, dear mother? Put my little shoes away. [APPLAUSE] (TALKING) That's the first song we sang. [MUSIC - THE EVERLY BROTHERS, "LONG TIME GONE"] (SINGING) You cheated me and made me lonely. I tried to be your very own. There will be a day you'll see me leaving, 'cause when I leave, I'll be a long time gone, be a long time gone, be a long time gone. Yes, when I leave, I'll be a long time gone. You're going to be sad. You're going to be weeping. You're going to be blue and all alone. You'll regret the day you seen me leaving 'cause when I leave, I'll be a long time gone, be a long time gone, be a long time gone. Yes, when I leave, I'll be a long time gone. (TALKING) All right. [APPLAUSE] You better do something. One more of these songs, if I can remember all the words. [MUSIC - THE EVERLY BROTHERS, "STEP IT UP AND GO"] (SINGING) A nickel is a nickel and a dime is a dime. Get you a girl and you'll have a good time. You got to step it up and go. You got to step it up and go. Hey, you can't stand back. You got to step it up and go. Jumped in the river and started to drown, I thought about my baby but I turned around. You got to step it up and go. You got to step it up and go. Well, you can't stand back. You got to step it up and go. Two old maids sitting in the sand, each one wishing that the other was a man. You got to step it up and go. You got to step it up and go. Well, you can't stand back. You got to step it up and go. Some people say that a preacher won't steal, but I caught three in my corn field. You got to step it up and go. You got to step it up and go. Well, you can't stand back. You got to step it up and go. (TALKING) Oh, remember that? We've got to step it up and go. [APPLAUSE] Thank you very much. Thank you. That was fun for us, in a-- Now all we have to do is get the band back out. Do you know, there's an interesting thing about "Step It Up and Go." The last time Don and I played Albert Hall, our father was here. And that's one of the reasons that we wanted to come back to Albert Hall. Was anybody here that was here the last time? [APPLAUSE] Well, that's good. Well, dad did step it up and go. So we were bound and determined that we'd do that. And I do hope y'all enjoyed it. We did those songs for us. It's fun. Thank you very much. [APPLAUSE] (SINGING) Bye-bye, love. Bye-bye, happiness. Hello, loneliness. Well, I think I'm gonna cry. Bye-bye, love. Bye-bye, sweet caress. Hello, emptiness. Well, I feel like I could die. Bye-bye, love, goodbye. There goes my baby with someone new. She sure looks happy. Oh, I sure am blue. She was my baby til he stepped in. Goodbye to romance that might have been. Bye-bye, love. Bye-bye, happiness. Hello, loneliness. Well, I think I'm gonna cry. Bye-bye, love. Bye-bye, sweet caress. Hello, emptiness. Well, I feel like I could die. Bye-bye, my love. Goodbye. I'm through with romance. I'm through with love. I'm through with counting the stars above. And here's the reason that I'm so free. My loving baby is through with me. Bye-bye, love. Bye-bye, happiness. Hello, loneliness. Well, I think I'm gonna cry. Bye-bye, love. Bye-bye, sweet caress. Hello, emptiness. Well, I feel like I could die. Bye-bye, my love. Goodbye. Bye-bye, my love. Goodbye. Bye-bye, my love. Goodbye. [APPLAUSE] (TALKING) We'd like to dedicate that song to all of you that showed up here tonight. [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC - THE EVERLY BROTHERS, "WAKE UP LITTLE SUSIE"] (SINGING) Oh, wake up, little Susie, wake up. [APPLAUSE] Wake up, little Susie, wake up. We've both been sound asleep. Wake up, little Susie, and weep. The movie's over, it's 4 o'clock, and we're in trouble deep. Wake up, little Susie. Wake up, little Susie. Well, what we gonna tell your mama? What we gonna tell your pa? What we gonna tell our friends when they say, "ooh la la"? Wake up, little Susie. Wake up, little Susie. Well, I told your mama that you'd be in by 10. Oh, Susie, baby, looks like we goofed again. Wake up, little Susie. Wake up, little Susie. We gotta go home. Wake up, little Susie, wake up. Wake up, little Susie, wake up. The movie wasn't so hot. It didn't have much of a plot. We fell asleep. Our goose is cooked. Our reputation is shot. Wake up, little Susie. Wake up, little Susie. Well, what we gonna tell your mama? What we gonna tell your pa? What we gonna tell our friends when they say, "ooh la la"? Wake up, little Susie. Wake up, little Susie. Wake up, little Susie.

I'll adore your charms sublime. Guess by now, you know that I'm devoted to you. I'll never hurt you. I'll never lie. I'll never be untrue. I'll never give you reason to cry. I'd be unhappy if you were blue. Through the years, our love will grow. Like a river, it will flow. It can't die because I'm so devoted to you. [MUSIC - THE EVERLY BROTHERS, "EBONY EYES"] On the weekend pass, I wouldn't have had time to get home and marry that baby of mine. So I went to the chaplain, and he authorized me to send for my ebony eyes. My ebony eyes was coming to me from out of the skies on flight 1203. In an hour or two, I would whisper, "I do," to my beautiful ebony eyes. [MUSIC - THE EVERLY BROTHERS, "LOVE HURTS"] Love hurts. Love scars. Love wounds and mars any heart not tough or strong enough to take a lot of pain, take a lot of pain. Love is like a cloud, holds a lot of rain. Love hurts. Love hurts. I'm young, I know. But even so, I know a thing or two. I've learned from you. I've really learned a lot, really learned a lot. Love is like a stove, burns you when it's hot. Love hurts. Love hurts. Some fools rave of happiness, blissfulness, togetherness. Some fools fool themselves, I guess. But they're not fooling me. I know it isn't true, know it isn't true. Love is just a lie made to make you blue. Love hurts. Love hurts. Love hurts. [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC - THE EVERLY BROTHERS, "TIL I KISSED YOU"] Never felt like this until I kissed you. [APPLAUSE] How did I exist until I kissed you? Never had you on my mind, now you're there all the time. Never knew what I missed until I kissed you. Uh-huh, I kissed you. Oh, yeah. Things have really changed since I kissed you, uh-huh. My life's not the same now that I kissed you, oh, yeah. Mm, you got a way about you. Now I can't live without you.

When I want you in my arms, when I want you and all your charms, whenever I want you, all I have to do is dream, dream, dream, dream. When I feel blue in the night and I need you to hold me tight, whenever I want you, all I have to do is dream. I can make you mine, taste your lips of wine anytime night or day. Only trouble is, gee whiz, I'm dreaming my life away. I need you so that I could die. I love you so, and that is why, whenever I want you, all I have to do is dream. I can make you mine, taste your lips of wine anytime night or day. Only trouble is, gee whiz, I'm dreaming my life away. I need you so that I could die.

You smiled, leading me on. I should have known you were temptation. It would be thrilling if you were willing. But if it can never be, well, then pity me. You were born to be kissed. I can't resist. You were temptation. I'm just a slave, only a slave. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You came, I was alone. I should have known you were temptation.
