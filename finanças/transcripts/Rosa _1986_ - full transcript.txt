ROSA PRESENTED BY ANTHONY CHOW Sir. - Sir. - Sir. - Sir. - Sir. PRODUCED BY SAMMO HUNG - Everything ready? - Yes. Security measures? Our cops are all around. It's totally safe. Sir, once you get in, you'll get him easily. The reporters are here too. Officer Tin's here. It must be a big case. Thanks for giving me this chance to perform. Sure. We do our jobs and you get all the credit, Sir. Is he carrying any weapon? He probably has blades at the worst. Blades? Blades can kill! Sir, give us a few minutes. We'll get someone to clean up the scene. Rookie! STARRING BIAO YUEN - I'm calling you. - Me? Come over. Yes, Sir. There's a detestable guy inside. He picks pockets. People call him Master Pickpocket. Go in and seize all his weapons such as blades and pins. Should I arrest him? Yes, but not by you. Just come out after you've searched him. Yes, Sir. Search thoroughly. Yes, Sir. STARRING LOWELL LO, HSIAO-FEN LU KARA WAI AND PAUL CHUN Master Pickpocket. Sir, you've got the wrong guy. That can't be. There's only you in this restaurant. What a coincidence. No, it's pre-arranged. Get up. PRODUCTION MANAGER JESSICA CHAN You're down on luck. Finish off your chicken leg and get ready for jail. Sir, please give me a chance. Just once would do. I'm not taking you. My chief will do it himself. No use begging for mercy. Just eat. Sir, I've searched him thoroughly. He's only got one blade. - Tell the reporters to get ready. - Yes, Sir. All reporters, please come over and get ready for taking photos. SCREENPLAY BY BARRY WONG AND KAR-WAI WONG Brother, don't shoot. No photos! No photos! No photos! - Don't be rash. - Tell them to go away. - Tell them to go away. - Go away. - Go away. - Go. Come here if you dare. Go away! Go away! Sir, don't be afraid. Shoot if you dare. No! You're toying with my life! I'll gun him down if you come closer. Shoot. Handcuff him. Sir. See, Sir, I said you'd be fine. Photos! Photos! Why did you do that to me... DIRECTED BY JOE CHEUNG - Boss. - Minibus Prince. - Hi, go inside... - Get out of my way... Are you bringing your Dummy Regiment here to lose? Of course not. - Tubby, - Yes. Tell them about the cash rewards and prizes. Bros, those who play get their rental fee waived. You get 100 dollars for a draw and 300 dollars for winning. Sound good to you? Clap if you agree. - Great. - Nice. Little Monster, they have high morale. You get all your dad's drivers here to play. You'll lose lots of business. So what? I like playing ball games most. Any kind of ball games. Let's make it clear. It mustn't be like last time. You left after losing 0-11 in the first half. We'll play till the end this time. - Tubby, - Yes. Kick off! What do you think of my car, Mary? It's the only one of its kind in Hong Kong. I wouldn't drive it, Kei. It's too expensive. No big deal. Shoot! - Oh no! - No big deal. Do you fix it for me if it's dented? That's my ball, please. Your terrific kick nearly dented my car. I'm sorry. Thanks. No need to apologize. You! What are you doing? - What's up? - How could he? Don't let him get away so easily, Little Monster. That's too embarrassing. I've played ball for long, but I've never burst one. Bro, stop! Police. Follow the car. Which one? - Over there, the yellow one. - Okay. Hands off me! How could you behave like that? Sorry, I've got it wrong. Follow the car first. - Bye-bye. - Bye. Wait for me! What are you doing? I'm coming with you, so I can get back my motorcycle. Steady. Are you trying to kill us? Are you okay? Mustache, what the hell are you doing? Little Mustache, how dare you run a red light? So what? Red can't get in my eyes. I run the red light whenever I want. So what? I hate people running the red light. I'll catch you whenever I want. So what? Freeze! Police! Crouch down on the car! Sorry, Sir. Can you give me a chance? Crouch down! My sister's in the hospital. I was in a hurry and ran the red light by accident. You're such a caring brother. Do you think I'll believe you? How could there be such a coincidence? Headquarters calling 2288, headquarters calling 2288. Stay put! I'm 2288, over. Your sister's in the hospital. Her condition is still unknown. I want to take a test drive. There's no need, Darling. Just buy it if you like. It's better to take a test drive. Don't butt in! Never mind him. He worries about the fetus all the time. I'm telling the truth. Driving is dangerous. No. The engine's good. The chassis is strong. It can withstand car crashes. Don't think you're smart! Darling, no! What's wrong with you? I'm only eight months pregnant. No horse-riding, no skipping, no judo and even no test driving now. Do you want to bore me to death? - But... - But what? Go away! I'll accompany you. No need! I'll do it. Darling! Oh my! Oh no! - How could you drive like that? - How are you, Darling? Sorry. My sister is in the hospital. I'm in a rush. Take my license plate number. I'll take responsibility. Stay here! Goodbye! Mustache! - Darling. - Darling, are you all right? Yes. - Our child... - What's wrong with it? - It's coming! - What, a premature birth? How is she? Is she all right? Doctor checked on her and said she's fine. But she needs observation. - Who are you? - Her brother. Brother? They don't look alike. Who are you? I brought your sister here. Thanks for being a good Samaritan. Don't mention it. She's in the hospital because of me. Punk, come with me. How did you hurt my sister? It was an accident. Of course I know. If you did that on purpose, you'd be on the ground now. Even so, you'll get three ribs broken. And since she was three, any man who talks to or touches her, without my permission... has to get three ribs broken. So now you'll get six ribs broken. That tough? Let me show you how tough I am. Go to hell! - What's the matter? - Let me go! - Doctor, he's insane. - Let me go! Who's insane? I'm a cop. Let me go. He's insane. Don't listen to him. - He's a cop? I'm a cop. - Brother. Why are you fighting? It was a misunderstanding. I'm fine. I'll surely win. No, Brother. I had a dream just now. In my dream, you've got three ribs broken. Me? Seems like she's right. You... Help him in. Excuse me. It's not my fault. I didn't fight back. He bumped into my fist. What're you talking about? I'm fighting you with my life. Leave first. My brother is hot-tempered. Call me. I'm leaving now. Punk, you're lucky to get away. I'll beat you each time I see you. No, Brother. You two became friends in my dream. With him? Not in this lifetime. Bro, which room is the Inspector of the Special Investigative Unit in? There are many sections in the unit. Which one are you looking for? Which one? The NI section. The NI section. Turn around and go to the last room. Okay, thanks. Punk, stay where you are! Hi! What a coincidence. When enemies meet, they know each other at a glance. - Morning, Inspector. - No need to pay lip service. If I were an inspector, I'll use my authority to get even with you. No nonsense. An inspector is right behind you. Stop pretending. I don't even give a damn to a Commissioner, let alone an inspector. Why are you so disrespectful of your supervisors? I'm not afraid of them. I'm gonna beat you, punk. - Morning, Sir. - Why did you slap him? I can't stand his arrogance. I slapped him for you. What? Oh no, he doesn't understand Cantonese. We're good friends, good friends... It's only for fun. What are you trying to prove? Sir, can you speak Chinese? Sorry, no, but I would like to learn. Stupid. What did he say? He told you to find him after reporting to the investigative team. That means I'm in big trouble? I don't know. That was what he said. - Sir. - Sir. Deities have helped me find you. Great! Come with me, both of you. Come. Let's go. Come in. I've gone through all the files of the Hong Kong Royal Police officers and found you two at last. I'll burn incense for deities first. Have a seat. Does he hold any grudges against you? I brought upon his demotion. And you? My case isn't that serious. I just damaged his car and caused his wife to give birth early. No big deal. Why did he look for us everywhere? He must want to use his authority to take revenge. I'll never do that. I'll only get rid of you using other people. Have a seat. Now you two are my direct reports. I can vent all my anger soon. Did you know we have to do case analyses? Any idea what it is? Case analyses? A murder took place here this morning but no witness would testify. The police came here after receiving a report... And found the dead lying over there. Situations like this require us to analyze what really happened. - Roger, Moore. - Yes, Sir. What do you think happened? - No idea, Sir. - No idea. And you two? No idea. Can't figure it out, Sir. I'll deduce then. I think the dead was being chased. He jumped over the rail up there to escape. He leaped out like Tarzan and wanted to grasp the creeper but he failed and fell dead. Sir, you were just guessing. That's why we need an experimental proof. Little Monster, play the dead's role and jump down from above. This is a rookie's job. Go. You two go up and act as the culprits. - Sure! - Sure! Now come out. Open the door! Open the door! Jump down! Jump down! There's no one after me. Why do I have to jump? Fall down! Fall down! Sir, I've grasped the creeper. Listen, there was an armed culprit down here. You fall down when I say "bang". You're crafty. Bang! Bang... Why don't you fall down? Sir, listen up, the dead was wearing a bulletproof jacket. A bulletproof jacket? Come on. It's more or less like this. Let's get off to work then. Hold on. There's another possibility. The dead was shot while going up the stairs. It's your turn to play the dead's role now. - No, Sir. - Shut up! Go up! Starting from here? Go up higher. Higher. Higher, so it looks like the real case. How can you not listen to Sir? You two are ganging up on me! - Just kidding. - Take it easy. Just kidding. Go up. When I say "bang", you go rolling down. Bang! Does it really hurt? I told you to roll down, not crawl down. It's the same, Sir. It's a long staircase. I wouldn't land on the same spot if I roll down. You don't respect our inspector's judgment. Actually, you think he's incompetent. You, you go up with me. You don't need to behave like that. Don't burn your bridges. - Just kidding. - Take it easy. Usually you'll react to a shot within a short range like this. Look. Bang! You can go far like this. Understand? No... You don't have to. Just go! Sir! This position fits perfectly. My deduction is right. It seems like them. Boss, they're here. - Mr. Wong. - Mr. Wong. Thanks for the work, bros. - Thanks. - Don't mention it. Mr. Wong, we've killed two cops because of this bag of jewelry. We risk our lives. I know. It's okay to ask for higher pay. You earn money to spend it. No problem. We'll pay. - Thanks, Mr. Wong. - Thanks, Boss. There will be more future cooperation. - Right? - Yes. - Give them money. - Yes. Wanna count it? - No. - No. - Let's go. - Let's go. We're rich! It's a shame! Boss. Did he really see it? I think so, based on what he said. - Let me talk to him. You oversee here. - Okay. Boss. Hi, I'm Bing-tong Wong. Mr. Wong, have one million ready, if you want the film roll. Or I'll give it to the police for printing. Sure, one million. I can give it to you anytime. Bro, which gang do you belong to? No need to ask. Remember, I'll be at Victory Restaurant tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. I'll be facing the door, drinking milk and reading an English paper. Okay. My man will bring you the money. He'll be wearing black gloves. How do I know what's on your film negatives? Do you want me to print out and enlarge the car explosion for photography exhibition? No need. Wait to get rich. May I take your order? Milk. I'll order later. Big Guy, be smart. The man is wearing black gloves. Get the money before giving him the roll. Don't worry. The roll is safe with me. I'll get the money. Okay, I'll be watching over there. Stay calm. Later please. This way, please. You're always pretending to be a movie star with your sunglasses. I'm over there. Let's take a seat over there. Waiter! What have you got for me? Send out all men. You must get him. Yes. This is Wai-wai Lee. He's an informer. Recently, he's taken a large sum from the police and vanished. He revealed that he's got evidence of a gang buying booty. Could he have been killed? No. Someone has seen him recently. Could he be lying to get a better reward? Possible. We'll know when we find him. This model is called Rosa. She's hot! Rosa is Wai-wai Lee's girlfriend. I suspect they're still in touch. Sir, let me work on this case. Just you? No, work with Little Monster. What? With him? Am I not good enough for you? Hurry up! Make two more bets. A man or a woman? - A woman! - A man! - A woman! - A man! A woman! We've won! Great! Pay us! I was told there are more men than women in Hong Kong. How could that be? Four women in a row! Do you know why Indians' teeth are so white? Because they're dark. That's right. Touch wood... Don't jinx me. Hurry up. Last bet. A man or a woman? You first. I think it's the opposite sex of a man, a woman! We think it's a man. Okay, one, two, three! - A woman! - A man! - Thanks. - Welcome. Thanks. Pay us! Excuse me, is Rosa here? Who's looking for her? Police. We want to talk to her. She's gone. Hey, you! Excuse me, where can we find her? Joints, Mahjong joints, Macau, pawn shops, or you can ask Gwei Lei Wong or Gwei Lei Coi. - They should have her details, right? - Yes. What the hell? It was obviously her. Don't be rash. You'll scare her. She won't run away. Go look at those deluxe cars. - I'd rather look at hot girls. - Just do it. Rosa, why did those cops want to talk to you? Must be about Wai-wai Lee's mess. - Have more bets. - Sorry, I have to work now. Why the rush? Come on, let's play poker. Don't be so addicted. Someone is looking for you outside. Again! Tell those two men to go to hell. Brother Loi. Brother Coi. You're the one to go to hell, not me. Brother Coi, I'm sorry. I should have repaid the debt... or at least some interest if I can't pay it in full, or at least some... Stop babbling. Have you got any money to repay? If I had money, I wouldn't have babbled. I wouldn't have babbled if I haven't got any money to pay you. What does that mean? That means I'm in a situation between having money and not having any. What does she mean, Dad? She's making a fool of me. Then I'll rape her and stab her twice. Don't be a fool. How can we get back our money? At least we get some compensation. You're right. Brother Coi, two dolts are here to support me. I didn't want to debase myself at first... but if you're in need of money I'll entertain them just once. Don't lie to me, wench. I dare not. I'll go find them at once. Isn't it gorgeous? Buy it. I need to starve for five years or pay by installments till 1997 to get it. - How much is it? - Over a hundred thousand. - I thought it was only a few ten thousand. - In your dreams. Officers, I'm Rosa. So you're Rosa. I couldn't talk to you just now. How can I help you? Oh, we... Will you wait for me? We can talk after I get off work. Okay. I'll treat you to dinner. Great, but I have a relative over there. He's a gambler. He keeps asking me for money. It's annoying. Do you want me to get rid of him? No thanks. He's a relative after all. I'll send him away. Such good luck! Done. Mustache has just won a lottery. - He's giving me 50,000. - Clever girl. What do your friends do? They're cops. Let me introduce. This is... My last name is Ha. His is Lui. Officer Ha, Officer Lui, this is Gwei Lei Coi. Gwei Lei Coi. So you're a loan shark. No. Gwei is my last name. My first name is Lei Coi. It's a lucky name. Officers, don't get it wrong. Stop babbling. Do you want money? How much? Money? It's not much. What? Dad, it's a huge sum. Silly boy, do you want to be arrested? I just wanted to say hi to Rosa. Let's have dinner together. No thanks. I'll earn my own food. - Wait for me at the car park. - Okay, okay. - Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. Let's go. I'm more car-savvy than you are. This car is awesome even though it's small. It's not just the engine. This steering wheel... Can turn left or right at will. The door's closed when it's not open. It's open when it's not closed. Great design by the Japanese. - It reminds me of one thing. - What? Your mom is a woman. Your sister is a woman. Your wife is also a woman. - Bullshit. - Bullshit. She's here. Start the car. Rosa, please get in. What for? Dinner. I'm going to take a rest. Enjoy yourselves. You just said... What did I say? I can't remember. Okay, no dinner. I have something to ask you. You have to cooperate. What? Is there a government regulation saying that citizens have to cooperate? I haven't broken any law. Hey, stop! - I haven't finished yet. - Don't follow me. Get out of my way! Told you not to pretend to be a cop. What? She won't have dinner with you even if you pretend to be the Governor. - Let's go. - Okay. No big deal! Dad, they're impostors! Go after her. Hurry up! Hurry! Wait for me! Start the car. - Wait for me! Wait for me! - What for? Didn't you say you have to take a rest? Not now. I'm having dinner with you. Dinner? Your treat? Yes, of course. Lift me up to chase her. Hurry! Are you willing to cooperate with us? Yes, yes, I do. Anything. That's better. Stop the car. Get in quickly! You wench. I'll strip off all your clothes next time. Nice. I didn't expect Wai-wai Lee to have such a good taste. This is my home. Wai-wai Lee isn't here. Still lying to us? Lying to us? Lying... Lying... lying to us. You force me to do this, Officers. I haven't been in touch with him for a long time. Miss, can you speak the truth? Why doesn't anyone believe me every time I speak the truth? And people believe all my lies. Excuse me, I have to rest. Tell us where Wai-wai Lee is, or we'll stay. As you like. I'm getting changed. I almost forgot. He appeared in my wardrobe a month ago. He said he was being pursued and asked me for money. It was the same excuse every time, so I threw him out. That's it. - Wardrobe? - Liar. Rosa, I'm being pursued. Please lend me some money, so that I can escape. I'm closing a big deal. I'll get rich soon. I'll take you to Europe. Please help me. She's hard to deal with. That's good, or I wouldn't have been able to shake her and found out she has such an ample figure. I'll let you go. Keep quiet, okay? Wai-wai Lee's here! What's she up to? Must be pretending again. Pretending. Outrageous. Wai-wai Lee? Don't trust her. Next door. No one. Over there! Not here! That room! He's in that room! Why don't you listen to me? I'm telling the truth. Do you want me to lie? Keep your mouth shut and I'll believe you. I've got him! I've got him! Come out! I've got him! I've got him! Don't go away! It seems like real. It's over. He was here a moment ago and now he's gone. Who knows if you're acting again. That's all for today. We'll come for you anytime. Let's go. Bye-bye. Go! What do you want? Go by the stairs. Brother. Why are you here? I asked her to come. You're exploiting this chance to woo my sister. What are you talking about? It's just supper. You said you wanted to learn more about women. At this age, besides my mom, I'm only on good terms with your sister. Paying lip service again. Let's go, Sister. Let's finish the meal before you go. If I leave now, do you think my sister will stay? - No idea. - She never goes against me. Let's go, Sister. Brother! Brother! Darn it. I was picked. You're good, punk. - Waiter! - What would you like to order? Lobster salad, French oysters, beef with black pepper, marinated baby pigeon and half a dozen beer. So much? Can we take it all? Dump it if we can't. It's costly to go out with girls. Money alone doesn't work sometimes. You need tactics, Brother. Don't play smart. What do you know? Everything. I'm a girl. To win a girl's heart, you should like what she likes or be grateful to her. Which is better? Be grateful to her, of course. Yes, and the girl will fall for you. Rosa, we've risked our lives doing this for you. You should know what to do. What? I don't know. You should look at my brother with grateful eyes and tell him gently, "Thanks so much. I won't bother you anymore." Just like this. Okay. Let's do it your way. I meant to say I'll marry him. You always mess things up. Put down your gun and police identity card. Abuse of power is a serious charge. Here you are. Let's go. Hurry up. Coming, coming! Lui Lui, if you see us being chased, drive over to pick us up at once. This is dangerous. I risk my life for you. What do I get in return? I'll marry you. In your dreams. Let's go! Do remember. - Thanks. - On behalf of everyone, I'd like to thank Gwei Lei Coi for letting us use this place. Should anything happen, he'll take the blame. It's my honor to take the blame for you. Ping, you first. Thanks for all your help. Our gang has some success. Most of us returned to our hometown rich and successful. What about you, Zung? Please ask your men to check the girls' ages when they come to my joints. Have a seat. You don't need to care for those guys. Find some old maids to serve them would do. Mr. Ho, those who are over 18 and with eyes and nose have left for beauty contests. Those who remain may be underage. You may easily become a sex offender. Let me make it clear. My men in jail can't protect sex offenders. They'll surely be castrated. Actually what's your name, bro? I've never pronounced your name right. Canny Walker. Please come in person if you have further questions. Who are you looking for? Please tell Brother Coi that two bros have come to see him. Okay, please go in. Have a seat. Mr. Ho. What? Two more bros have come? - Did they say which gang they belong to? - No. All our men are here. Go see who they are. Wench, how you dare come here! Brother Coi, I'm with my boss. Boss? Which area? Shit, man. Boss isn't classified by areas. My boss is international. He's on the topmost tier. Rosa is his girl. He's here to buy her freedom. If you can repay Rosa's debt, I'll call him anything. Big boss or big, big boss. You name it. How much does Rosa owe you? I only borrowed 3,000 dollars from him. Yes, you borrowed 3,000 dollars. But with interest, it's over 11,000 dollars. Ask your man if you don't understand. Eleven thousand dollars for a loan of 3,000 dollars? That's highway robbery. You're right. I'll pay you 3,000 dollars for your loan of over 11,000 dollars. My man will show you how it works out. That's easy. We're heavy-handed. We always do it our own way. We benefit ourselves by harming others. So tough? What's the background of your boss? Listen carefully. My boss is Juliani Julimagasine. Never heard of it. Never? He's so famous! He's not a real gangster. Tell him some commoners' names. Have you heard of Walker from the Yau Tsim District? Walker! Walker! What's the matter? We've never taken him seriously. Have you heard of Ping from the Kowloon Walled City? You mean Chiu Chow Ping. Ping! Brother Coi, what's up? All petty gangsters are gathered here. Have you heard of Zung from Tsz Wan Shan in Wong Tai Sin? Zung what? Who's calling my name? What a nuisance. Come, come here. The people you just named are all here. Big trouble. Birds of a feather flock together, just as expected. And the renowned... Boss Ho and Prisoner Hung. They're even your relatives. - Anyone else? - Can't think of any. Keep thinking! Who else? Spit it out! Are you trying to kill with this flowerpot? In the US and Canada, my boss is also... Yes, in San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Vancouver, Toronto, Congo and Africa. - All of them, right? - Yes. So you're the godfather of everywhere except for Hong Kong. Yes. So what? I'm the godfather of Hong Kong. - What should we do now? - Stay cool. - They won't take our words seriously. - Okay. We'll show them our men. Our men? Still pretending? Pretending? Come over and look outside. - Let's look at it together. - Okay. Mr. Ho, what should we do? The odds are against us. Let's make peace. Bro, no, cousin, it's a misunderstanding. Now you see. What should you do with Rosa's IOUs? - Want me to whistle again? - No, no. Take out all of Rosa's IOUs. As gangsters, we can talk it over. Gwei Lei Coi, glad that you compromise. Do I have to repay over 11,000 dollars now? No, no. It's just a small sum. I'll tear off all your IOUs. Wipe the slate clean. One good turn deserves another. Here's 3,000 dollars. Let's be friends. Thank you. Next time when you're in the US or Canada, remember to visit my boss. Dare not bother you. Let's go. This way, please. Dad, Dad, someone threw some flowerpots downstairs. Now the street is packed with people. - Close the door. - Yes. Freeze! Police! Stay put. Stay put. Naughty. What's that? Stop pretending. They saw it. Brother Coi, shall we help you fix them? Don't bother. Just something trivial. I can do it myself. Okay, let's continue with our meeting. Coi, just beat them till they're crippled. - Don't kill them. - I know. Act accordingly. Wench, how you dare bring people here to mess with me. Are you fed up with living? They asked for it. Beat them to death. You deserve it. Mr. Ho, help... - Doesn't sound right. Let's go out. - Okay. Go. Let's go. Brother Coi, told you to leave it to us. You can't handle this. Hold on. How can you get distracted in front of a strong rival? Get up! You scum, it's bad of you to fool around. Go to hell! I'll fight you. I'll kill you. Where else can you kick other than my leg? Mr. Ho. Boss, big boss. You bloodsucker. You've done so many bad things. I won't. I've thought it over. I'll be a philanthropist from now on. Never bother Rosa again. Of course. - Sorry, Rosa. - Okay. Go. Go to hell! This way. This way. Dad, are we really going to change jobs? Don't be silly. If I don't suck another people's blood, should I let others suck mine? Okay. Let's get on with the meeting. No way! Mr. Ho, bros... BUSINESS IS BUSINESS Six-circle. I'll claim it. Three sets ready. Why did you discard that tile? She has three sets now. It's wrong to hold a tile that others need. A good hand is more important. Right. A good hand is more important. Shall I give you another tile you need? One-circle. Game. I win. Genius! A big hand in the first round. You should be proud of yourself. - Why are you grinning? - Because I've got a big hand in my first round. Thirteen Orphans. Pay up. We're losing big money because of how you played. Right. How could you discard one-circle? You're good, punk. This one's for you. Got it. - He's got the tile I need. - Got it. Six-character. Got it. Seriously? You got it again? Four-character. Got it. Three sets ready. You deserve it. Can you complete your hand when all the tiles you need are gone? Brother, don't be merciless. Never mind. He's like that. Nine-circle. Shrug your shoulder? Three-character. - Claim it if you can! - Got it! You haven't won the game. Got it! My third set is almost ready. Watch out. I give up. I'll get rid of this Seven-character. - I'll take it. Three sets ready. - Got it! You want character tiles too? I'm going to build a Kong. Got it. Discarding Eight- or Nine-character? Of course not. Three sets ready. Can I treat this as a long hand? - No way. - No way. You were so eager just now. Now you'll have to pay for them. Really? Let's see what hand you've got. It won't hurt to discard a tile. Got it! I win, and you have to pay for them. How could you discard Nine-character? So silly of you. I hid it when I drew one. Three sets ready. Watch out. What now? - Trying to cause chaos? - What's wrong? Nervous, just nervous. I think you were trying to look at our tiles. He has never finished a match. Again? What's wrong with you? - Not a nice way to vent your anger. - No need to overturn the table. It's a self-drawn! Look! Nine-bamboo! Nonsense. I can say I've got a self-drawn too. I already said he couldn't finish a match. A person's nature is best revealed while playing Mahjong. Laugh when you win. Lose your temper when you lose. No one believes me? Game over. Go to bed. - I believe you now. - Never mind him. Put away the tiles. I've told you friends shouldn't play Mahjong together. Get up, get up! What's up? Let me give you a psychological test. During a moonless and windy night, your sweetheart is sleeping next door. Will you, A, open your door and wait for her to come in, or B, take the initiative and try to sleep with her? Of course B is more practical. Do you want to become part of the Lui family? What if I want? What if I don't? Help me if you want. How? Open the door. Open the door. What's the matter? Look at Lui Gung. What's wrong with your brother? I don't know. He's sleepwalking. Sleepwalking? Don't scare me. Is that for real? Don't you believe? Hold me tight, Lui Lui. Closer. Normally, he'll chase after me with a knife. Now he has no reaction. He must be sleepwalking. Try to wake him up. Don't! Never disturb a person who is sleepwalking. Right. I heard that it'll bring bad consequences. What should I do then? Try your best to protect him. If he's about to fall down, hold him tight. Hold him tight? Will he attack me? Others won't. I'm not sure about him though. No, no. Sleepwalkers are peaceful. Be good to him and let him do whatever he wants. That's not fair to me. Making a fool of me too? I can't handle this if he behaves like this the whole night. Help me wake him up. Okay. Let's use my family's way. What is it? Beat him with a rod and then burn him. Make him drink urine if he still doesn't wake up. - Really? - Yes. Go urinate now. No. That's cruel. Let him wake up naturally. Brother! He's awake! How do you feel? Are you okay? What happened? You were sleepwalking. Really? Again? Yes. You've caused so much trouble to Rosa. I don't know anything. Luckily, Little Monster taught me how to wake you up. Sorry to bother you. Is he like this all the time? Good night. - Morning, Sir. - Good morning, Sir. Where have you been these two days? Following Rosa around to get Wai-wai Lee. Although we still haven't found Wai-wai Lee, we've got satisfactory results. You can't even find the man. How can we solve the case? No, Sir. We're optimistic. Rosa is getting close to us. Yes. I think it's important to follow Rosa. I'll follow her around the clock. Haven't you managed to woo her? No. She's hard to woo. I've spent a lot for her and even risked my life for her. We nearly created a big mess. Luckily, I've got Little Monster's help. Big mess? You try to woo a girl when you're on duty? Sir, Rosa has no obligation to help us find Wai-wai Lee. To get her help, we must get along first. Lui Gung is doing this for the case. Do you need to reimburse your expenses? Of course, tea, dinner, shopping, movies, the four of us. Four? With my sister. Two couples. I'll state in your files that you claim reimbursement for wooing girls. Sir, we'll spend our own money. Yes, our own money. Back to work. Yes, Sir. Big mouth. Why take so long to make a move? No point learning it. Make a move, will you? Playing chess needs thinking. We're not playing scissors-stone-paper. Jerk. Check. - Check. - Move Elephant here. Take it. You're finished. Alright. Let's play again. Why do you mess up our game? - Just kidding... - Take it easy. Start over again... Darn it. Let's go. Wanna fool around again? Game over. - They're hot! - Let's go! Where are your brother and Little Monster? They've asked us to come. They'll show up. Let's take a seat and wait. Miss, do you want to report a case? I'm Roger. Looking for your boyfriends? I'm Moore. - Let's be friends. - What's your name, Miss? Take a seat. - What the hell! - What are you doing? - How can you do that? - So annoying! - Scum. - How could you? That's harassment. - What's up? - What's up? He molested me. You molested my sister? - Just kidding. - Take it easy. To hell with you! - Just kidding. - Misunderstanding. Just kidding? Do this to your mom. - Just kidding. - I know. Just kidding. - I know you were just kidding. Have a seat. - Okay. Sit down and talk. - No need to be tense, right? - Yes. Everyone, let me tell you a story. Life is so stressful. You need to relax sometimes. Right? But this story requires inference. Do you have brains? Yes. There are four stages in this story. Here's stage one. A woman told her husband... "Darling, tonight I'll make you soup with hairy antler, fish tripe and soft-shelled turtle. What do you say?" - Nice. - Of course. So the husband went home right after work. He was surprised to see his wife take out salted fish and vegetables. He asked, "Where's the soup that you promised?" The wife slapped him and asked, "Who's cooking dinner? You or me?" Now stage two, the husband asked his wife, "Shall I take you to the Peak and have steak?" Of course. The wife put on perfume, makeup and sexy clothing. But her husband took her to Poor People's Night Club. The wife was surprised and asked, "Aren't we going to the Peak and have steak?" "Why did you take me here?" The husband slapped her and asked, "Who's driving? You or me?" Now stage four. - Where's stage three? - Yes. Where is it? "Who's telling the story? You or me?" - You're making fun of us! - Just kidding. Take it easy. Oh no! I hit it! It's so boring to watch them play all night. We're men. We should let them play first. I didn't mean that. I want you to leave with my sister first. Then I can get to know Rosa better. - Hit! - Shoot! Will Rosa ask you to stay behind? I've figured it out. Shoot again! I'm hungry. Let's make something to eat. Yes. You've played a long time. It's our turn now. Okay. What do you want to eat? - Anything. - I don't mind. Anything. - Our turn afterwards. - Okay. Go. Darn it. What do you want? Again? What are you doing? Why are you fighting with my brother? He swore when he lost. He cursed too. - What happened to you? Quiet! - What are you talking about? No, don't fight. - Let me go. I'll beat him up. - Quiet, you both. Lui Lui, you leave with Little Monster first. - I'll kill you. - No! Kill him! - You'd have died if she hadn't stopped me. - Go, let's go. Stay if you have the guts. - Forget it. - Stay if you dare. You're not a child anymore. - Let's go. - Done. What do you mean? Your brother said if he didn't show up after 15 minutes, you'll have a sister-in-law tomorrow. What sister-in-law? Don't you know your brother and I are best partners? Let's go. Why are you so hot-tempered? It was his fault. I'm going downstairs. What now? It'll be the end of my sister if they spend time alone. Sit down and relax. Little Monster is not a bad guy. I know him better. Don't you believe? Let me be him and you be my sister. Now try to comfort me. Okay. Little Monster, forget it. Calm down. He'll definitely make advances to her. What are you doing? Not like this. My sister is gentle. She won't hit. She'll just say "no" gently. Let's do it again. See what you're up to. Okay. No. Right. My sister's gentleness will encourage him. He'll make further advances. Come on. No. My sister won't do that. I know. Now She won't be able to control herself and she'll take the initiative. Yes... Then she'll throw herself into his arms. Then she'll... Can you stop mentioning my sister? - I'm playing your sister's role. - What's wrong with you? Now I'm turned on and can't control myself. No! My sister won't go so far. She will, and now she's sexually excited - and ready to prey on her man. - Stop! Nonsense! Shameless! My sister won't do that. Why not? She's just like her brother. I'm horny but quite romantic. You're insulting my whole family. I'm leaving now. No sense of humor. Hi, who's this? Rosa, I'm going up to get back my suit. Suit? I threw it away. What? There's an important film roll in it. Great. You've taken two gold watches, one diamond necklace and a pair of jade bracelets from me. Give them back to me and I'll give you back the film roll. Rosa, I'm sorry. Rosa, please. We were lovers briefly. Remember the night at Pattaya a year ago? There was only you and me at the beach. We slept on the floating bed and... I couldn't stand your sexy voice. Dirty. Where's the film roll? Take me to get it. How important can this be? Liar. What? Apologize to her? What have I done wrong? After all, it was your fault. You were up to no good and you threw a tantrum at Rosa. You're not gentleman-like. Apologize to her. I'm a man. You want me to apologize? You think she's the only woman in the world? There are many women, but you've only got one chance. Think it over. It costs nothing to say "sorry". Okay. You should have said that earlier. Money. You should have done that long ago. It's my fault. Stay put. Put your hands on your head. - Go down to intercept him. - Okay. Freeze. Don't come near. Trying to get killed? Lui Gung! Lui Gung! Lui Gung, Lui Gung. Little Monster, I'm dying. Stay strong. You'll be fine. I have one wish before my death. You must promise me. I promise you. Anything. I want to tell Rosa something. What's it? What's it? Tell me. I want to take her to bed. How can I say that to her? Try using more civilized language like copulation or fornication. As long as we're both happy. You want me to pimp for you? You aren't helping me with my death wish. Okay. I promise you. Anything. Push the patient to Ward number six. Doctor, is he all right? If he doesn't drink or smoke, or infected with AIDS, he can live for years. Remember your promise. Don't back out. Little Monster, how's my brother? Go in to see him. Rosa, can we have a word? What's up? So mysterious. Lui Gung said... I don't know how to say it. Just quote what he said to you. He said his time is up. He wanted you to... To what? To bend his waist. Bend his waist? What does that mean? It sounds ridiculous. He said he's never bitten his big toe. He regretted about it. He doesn't need my help to do this. I know this sounds strange. But help him if you can, as a friend. Okay. As his friend, I'll help him with his last wish. - Lui Lui, come out. - What's up? Come, I've got something to tell you. - Why do we need to go out? - Rosa will fulfill your wish. You don't seem like dying. It's a momentary recovery of consciousness. Little Monster has already told me. Your wish is strange... but acceptable. You're understanding. I've never done this... in such a situation. It's my first time. I think so too. Do you need to warm up? Your waist might not stand it. No problem. If my wish comes true, I can give away my life. Shall I clean it first? Wouldn't it be dirty to just put it in? Don't worry. I'm hygienic. It's absolutely clean. Let's make it clear. Shall I stop... If you scream? No. Don't stop even if I scream. Pleasure and pain are inseparable. Please be gentle. This is about force. I'll take care. Open your mouth. What style is this? Haven't seen this in porn magazines. What are you doing? What are you doing? Don't scream. Stop! It hurts! Stop! You told me not to stop no matter how painful it is. No. It hurts! Stop! Stop screaming. It'll be over soon. What are you doing? Nothing. I'm his friend and I'm trying to fulfill his wish. That's murder! My efforts are unappreciated. What's up? Your wish has come true. What? She bent my waist with force and put my toes into my mouth. Little Monster said it was your wish. You couldn't bite your big toe and you regretted about it. What? I said I wanted to take Rosa to bed. What? Shameless! - Rosa, Rosa. - Rosa. - Rosa! - Let me go. Brother, does it hurt? That's normal for a man. Agreed. Shameless. Come here. I want to talk to you. What? Do you like biting your toes? Here, a whole foot! Film roll. Wai-wai Lee was killed because of this film roll. You're after me because of it too. Now that you've got it. Don't bother me anymore. Come with me. Pals before dates. We should share our suffering. What are you talking about? I'm calling Inspector Tin. Hello. Hello, Sir. I have some good news for you. Please come to the hospital now. Just say it over the phone. I'm treating my piles. He's treating his piles. He must come. We can see how he suffers and feels happy at the same time. Sir, if you want to win back your name, please come at once. - Rosa, don't be mad. - How can I not be mad? He made fun of me. Forgive him. He did that - to please you. - I hate people who are disrespectful. What do you want? Don't move. - Rosa, Rosa! - Don't move. Get into the car. Inspector Tin. I know I'm right about your abilities. What's the good news? Sir, the doctors here can treat piles well. Isn't it good news? You're making fun of me. Wait for your demotions. Don't be mad, Sir. Here's your good news. I know you won't disappoint me. Wai-wai Lee said he's taken photos related to a crime committed by Bing-tong Wong. After some twists and turns, I've got the film roll at last. Sir, we've suffered great hardship and risked our lives. I know that was hard. I'll remember it. Remember or record it, Sir? Record it, black and white. Stay with him here. Take your time to recover here. No rush. Bye. Will he take our credit? I guess he's not that mean. - Hello. - Is it Lui Gung? He's in bed. Who's calling? Help! Help! Rosa, Lui Lui. Rosa! Give it to me. Listen. Bring the film roll to Hong Kong Warehouse within half an hour. If you call the police, come over to collect their dead bodies. What's the matter? Rosa and Lui Lui have been taken hostage. I'll get back the roll from Inspector Tin. Wait for me. Should you have taken my advice to drive a minibus, you'd have had a house, a car and a wife now. It's not too late to quit being a cop. You're lucky to have me as your friend. It's not that easy to drive a minibus. You need extensive knowledge about the world and people. Are you serious? It's just driving. You need to be all eyes and all ears. Zigzag, move and stop at will. Be careful! You idiot, can you drive? Do you have a license? Inspector Tin. What's so great about a cop? Don't think I'll be scared of your gun. Hong Kong is unlike the past. Inspector Tin was my supervisor. He's a nice guy. Your ex-supervisor. Okay, I'll respect your feelings. - Okay, let's go. - Hold on. Forget it? What now? It's just a car crash. Do I go to jail for this? I'm not accusing you of the car crash. I suspect you of murder, arson, rape, ransom, smuggling and drug trafficking. Go over there. Spread your legs. A misunderstanding, Sir. Please give me a chance. - Misunderstanding? - He's my friend. That's Inspector Tin. Inspector Tin. Little Monster. You arrived just in time. Help me handcuff him. You're too arrogant. What are you doing? Handcuff him, not me! I'm really sorry, Sir. Go! What do you want the film roll for? They look nervous. What's wrong? Let's follow them. Are you out of your mind? We have our own reasons. Do you want to betray me? Be ready for jail. Stop! Don't try to run away after knocking into my car. Pay up! No one is here. Don't worry. They'll find us. Go. You're in time. Listen carefully. Get into the elevator. Follow my instructions. The elevator will take you to the 10th floor. After the door opens... Go out and put the film roll on the ground. Then go back into the elevator. It'll take you to the ground floor. Where are the two hostages? I haven't finished yet. They'll wait for you downstairs. What if we don't see them? Do you have a choice? Show me the film roll. Turn around and look. No need to push. I'm controlling it. I'm telling you, I don't want to kill cops or their families. Be cooperative. When I get the film roll, you can leave with the hostages. Otherwise, you're all doomed. How long does it take to run from 10th floor to first floor? Less than three seconds if you jump down. A few minutes if you run down. Give me 30 seconds. Try to delay them. I'll take the film roll downstairs to save them. - What should I do? - Act accordingly. No talking. If anything goes wrong, I'll kill the hostages. Nothing. We thought you might be Kien Shih, the big villain. Film roll. Take it out. Put it over there. Maybe there. Let's put it there, there. There, over there. Hurry up! Put it there, there, right. - Bro, something's fishy. - Put it down. Over there. - Hoist the hostages up. - Hurry up! Listen. Hurry up. - Are you okay? - I'm alright. The car's here, but where are they? Go to hell! Don't run! Rosa! Rosa, Rosa. - What happened? - What's up? - Where are they? - What happened to you? Little Monster is surrounded and being beaten up inside. Beaten up? Minibus Prince, take her to the police. Go! Brother! Brother! Go help Little Monster. Go! Little Monster! What have you done? Go to hell! Get in. You stay here. You follow me. Yes. Freeze! Get up! - How are things going? - Sir, my brother and Little Monster are inside. - Follow me. - Yes, Sir. - Handcuff him. - Yes, Sir. Get me down. - Brother! - Lui Gung, how are you? - How are you? - I'm fine. My buttock is bleeding. Thanks for your hard work. Where's Little Monster? He's locked up in the refrigerating chamber. - Open it up! - Yes, Sir. Go in and get them out quickly. Pull them apart. I can't. Then... Little Monster! Little Monster! Little Monster! Brother, Little Monster is fine. What's wrong with you? Are you cold? He's better today. He put on a sweater yesterday. It's psychological effect. I'll get used to it. I've got a room ready for each of you. Each takes one and go upstairs. No thanks. We're getting married next week. Right. We shouldn't fool around. One last time before your marriage. Three months before I got married, I enjoyed every day, every night, every minute and every second. Both pretty girls and nice food. Marriage is like getting your car overhauled. After that, it's wrong to fool around. He's right. Go. It's been paid for. Ladies. - Paul. - Darling. Fooling around and cheating are the same? Overhaul. I called Mrs. Tin. He asked for it. You didn't expect that we were the girls introduced by Inspector Tin, - right? - Of course not or we won't come. What did you say?
