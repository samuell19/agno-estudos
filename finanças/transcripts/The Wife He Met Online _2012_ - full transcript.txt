- I'm back tonight with the third instalment of our "Love Conquers All" series. Tonight I'm with Georgia and Bryant who fell in love even though they lived 3,000 miles apart. So, Georgia, tell us your story. - Well as you already know, we met on an online dating site I was out in LA and he was here in Philadelphia. - So was this your first experience with online dating? Uh no, I had done the online thing before. But this girl Penny convinced me to give it another try. I was working as a stylist on a photo shoot and she was the coordinator. That's Kyle? - Hmm, hmm. - Whoa! Does he have a twin? - If he did I'd keep 'em both. Double the fun. Double the drama. You should see some of the guys I've been matched up with. Uh sweetie, this one, silver sandals thanks. - Same story with most of my friends. Guys that go online are usually just looking for a booty call. - This one guy was looking for a lot more than that. He wanted a place to stay! - What? - Oh yeah. Yeah he was literally living in his car and spending his days at a cyber cafe. Beware of anyone who lists their occupation as entrepreneur. Well if things work out with Kyle and I think they might, I will never say another bad thing about online dating - So you created your profile and started receiving matches. - Then what? - Well to be honest, I wasn't really sure it was going to work. My neighbour, she and her husband are actually going to be here today, she convinced me to try it and my colleague David thought I was nuts. You're married, okay? You have no idea how hard it is out there. - Yeah well, I know there were beautiful women in every bar I go to. And sometimes it makes me feel like I settled down too young. Don't tell Tania I said that. Okay, so what am I supposed to do, prop Megan up on a bar stool and say wait here while daddy goes and hits on a ton of women and finds your next stepmom? - That's a great idea. Megan can be your wingman, your wing girl. Wing girl. Your ex-wife has Megan half the time anyway. At least with online you get to know a little bit about the person before you talk to them. - You're sure about that? Zenya says people lie all the time on those dating sites. She should know, she's been on 'em long enough to be an expert. - Some people exaggerate, not everyone. Then a month or so later I got matched with Georgia. So you can imagine how I rubbed it in David's face at the bachelor party. So was it love at first sight? You know, not exactly. Uh. We lived 3,000 miles apart so it began as online chatting and kind of progressed from there. - Dad. - Yes sweetie? - Are you chatting online with that lady again? - No I'm, I'm, I'm just working sweets - Yeah right dad. You are too smart for your own good you know that? - Yeah. Mom says the same thing. - I bet she does. Eventually we graduated to speaking on the phone. Georgia is, she's just different than anyone I have ever met. Sorry about that, it was just a kid selling something. - Okay, now back to my original question. Do you or don't you kiss on a first date? - Why don't we just let that be a surprise for the first date? - I want to know what to expect. - From what I've seen so far, yeah I'd probably try and kiss you on the first date. - What if I had just eaten a really garlicy pizza? - Yes I would take one for the team and I would try to kiss you anyway. Well that is a good thing. - It got to the point where we were talking almost every day. We were e-mailing, we were chatting online. Hey! - Oh, hi Georgia. - Hi, Megan. How are you, oh I like your shirt, that's really cute. - Thanks. Step it up Dad, ask her out on a real date. - Okay, go to bed young lady. - Good night Georgia. Wow! Megan thinks I should step it up and ask you out on a real date. - Well it's about time. - One week later I was on a flight to LA. - Oh ah, there it is! - There it is, great! Look at that there's a, there's a sign right there telling you not to forget where you parked. - What? Oh! In fact you pretty much parked right in front of the sign and you still sort of forgot. - Yeah, well if I had to read every sign that people wanted me to read all day long I would do nothing but read signs, so... - You know something? You are even more beautiful in person. - Thank you. - So what was it like when you finally met face to face? - It was like we'd been best friends forever. - I kiss much better in person than I do online. - Uh huh. Yeah, you do. - What do you say that we, we get out of here and we go somewhere just a little bit more private? - So are you glad you made the trip to LA? - Hmm, hmm. I haven't felt like this in a long time. - Really? - Yeah. So, I was thinking, if you don't have any work lined up at the end of the month maybe you could come to Philadelphia. - That would be terrific. Hmm. From that point on we took turns visiting each other. - So you would just meet up on long weekends? - About twice a month. He'd go out to LA for a few days or I'd come here. Sometimes we'd meet up in different cities, San Francisco, New Orleans, New York. That's actually where he proposed. - Sorry to interrupt, but uh... - Oh no that's okay. Chelsea, this is Zenya Vonsky, one of the partners at Bryant's ad agency. - Hi. Zenya, such a beautiful name. - Oh well thank you very much. - Bye Georgia - So they're almost ready. Got it, thanks. - Okay. Oh my goodness, you look so... mwah! ...beautiful. - I'm sorry we're late, the hairdresser was running half an hour behind. - Oh really? Well that's okay, it was worth it, look at you. Hey, why don't you go tell Georgia that you're here? - Okay. - Okay. You look great. - Well, I think the last time I saw you in a tux was our wedding. - Look I, I know you feel like this whole thing with Georgia happened really fast. But I, I appreciate you being so understanding. - I know. You said that. - I mean it. - It's your night and Georgia's. I'll uh, I'll pick her up at 9:00. - Okay. - Congratulations. - Wow! You look great. - So do you. - Don't you wish we could wear these dresses every day? - Can you help me with something very special? - Uh huh. - I want you to hold onto this for me okay? - Imagine if I lost it. - I trust you. Go ahead and tell them I'll be right out okay. - Oh sweetheart! It is such a beautiful dress! I was beginning to think I'd never see you wear one. Mom. - Well honey after what happened with Geoffrey. - Why'd you do that? - What? Why did you mention Geoffrey right now? - Georgia! What the hell are you doing? Is that gasoline? You crazy bitch, you're going to light my house on fire? - Geoffrey, no, no don't, I love you. - You love me? - I cannot believe how insane you are. I need the police. My ex-girlfriend just broke into my house and doused the place with gasoline. - Is she still in the house? - No she just left. - Alright sir, please hang on the line while I contact the police... - Oh honey I'm so sorry. I didn't want to put a damper on your big day. There. It's all about you and Bryant now. - Look I told you it brings up feelings when your ex gets remarried. - No, it has nothing to do with that. It's the same thing I've been saying ever since they got engaged. - Well you told Bryant your concerns, that's all you can do. Look, he loves Georgia and doesn't feel like they've rushed into it. - I know. - Well... - I will say this however. Bryant and I went out for almost four years before he proposed. - You were 23 Virginia. It's a little different when you're older. You know I knew much quicker that I'd be happy with you than I did with Kate. In fact I don't think I was ever really happy with Kate. - Well I just hope it works out for Megan's sake. - I think everybody's enjoying themselves. - Whoever planned this certainly knew what she was doing. - Yes she did. - Hi. - This frosting is to die for. - Is that your second piece of cake young lady? It is isn't it? Not too much okay? Okay. I'll get us some more champagne? - Keep it flowing, the night's still young. Okay. Hey guys. I would like some more champagne please. You know what, I'll take care of it. Thank you. - Nice choice of champagne. Thank you. Well it was all Georgia, she planned the entire wedding. You fix my tie and I will try and do this It's my reverse right-handed champagne pouring trick. That's not, no, I promise, you can't take me anywhere. Bartender, he's cut off. - You having fun? - I am. - Yeah? Cheers. - I saw you. You were flirting with the bartender. The minute I leave you try to have sex with someone you don't even know. - You think I was trying to pick up the bartender while you were in the washroom? - You were flirting and laughing, it was disgusting! - And you swore that you would never take the plunge. - Well, I should have listened to you - What's wrong? - I feel sick to my stomach. - See you later. - Yeah. - No, no this can't, this can't be happ... happening again. No. No. - I think maybe you should just go back to your place tonight. - I am not some puppet that you can just throw aside. I am your girlfriend. - Go home Georgia, please. - No, no. Where'd Georgia go? - She got up all of a sudden and went to the bathroom. I think she might feel sick or something. - What are you doing? - I can't... - It'll be alright. - Georgia. - Yes. - Are you okay? - I got a stain on my dress and I need some soda water. - Well I can help you if you unlock the door. - Uh. Can you, can you ask the bartender to, to give you some, Hey. You crying. Oh no, come on, come here. Shhh. Now what is it? What, what is it, what's wrong? - It's, it's my dress, it's ruined. - What, this? Well that's, that's not so bad. You can, you can barely see it. - Barely, it's huge its... - No it's, it's tiny. It's okay. You want to go out there and finish saying hi to everybody that we haven't yet? Hmm. Okay. Just give me a few minutes okay? - Okay. Sure? - Yeah. Mom were you in there the whole time? - Well, it would have been awkward to interrupt that little moment of insecurity. Wow! You keep that up, he's going to get tired of you real fast honey. - Don't say things like that that get into my head. - Wha...just trying to help you. Lord knows you haven't been able to keep a man by yourself. - So... Did you get to meet some of Georgia's family? - No they didn't come. Really? How about her friends? - They didn't come either. - So not a single friend? - I don't think so. They were all people dad knows. Is that bad or something? - No. No, no um, just a little unusual. - We didn't get a chance to interview any of your family Georgia. - They couldn't make it. - Well what about your cousin Tom, isn't he here with his wife? I mean I haven't had a chance to say hi yet. - Their kid broke his leg and they had to flake. - What? Oh that's too bad. - So there's nobody? - The only person I really wish was here was my mother. But she died when I was little. - Oh wow! I'm, I'm sorry, I didn't know. - That's okay. I've really been able to feel her presence all day. - Well, I think we have more than enough footage. We'll send you a copy. - I have not been able to take my eyes off of you all night. - Well you could at least for a little while in the bar. - At the bar? - You were all giggly, giggly with Zenya. And I didn't want to say anything, but I felt a little ignored. - Sweetie that's, that's silly, we, we talked for less than two minutes. Are you sure there isn't something more to that relationship that I should know about? - No. - You're just close friends? - Hey. I'm serious okay, there's nothing else going on there. - If you say so. - Why are you making me feel guilty when I didn't do anything wrong? - You haven't done anything wrong. And in fact, you have done everything right. - Hmm. You are the most important woman in the world to me Mrs. Georgia Myers. And I will spend the rest of my life making sure that you know that. - Mmm. - You need help. Serious psychiatric help. - That is not true. - I spoke to your uncle. He said you're supposed to be taking pills. - I don't need medication. Okay, I'll take the pills. I'll go see a shrink. Just tell me you're not going to leave me. My God, you are leaving me aren't you? I hate you! What year was he born? - Hey, what are you doing? - Nothing, I just couldn't sleep. - Hmm, well I missed waking up to you. - I know. Well, I ordered room service in case you're hungry. Mmmm. - One moment, ma'am, I'll put you through. Who's calling us this early? that's for sure. Hello. - Hey, it's me. Uh listen, I'm so sorry to bother you, I actually left you a voice mail on your cell too. - Yeah I had the roamer turned off. What's going on? - Well I got a message last night when I got home from Haley Preston's agent. They want some major revisions to the contract. - Like what? - Well nothing we wouldn't be willing to do, but it has to be done today. - Who is that? - Zenya. - There's no time to waste, we're up against a deadline... So I'm on my way to the office right now to work on it but we have to go over the stuff, you know, before I send it out. Should I come get you? - No I, I have my car here, but um, I'll leave it for Georgia so yeah come and get me. - Okay. 15 minutes. - I'm really, really sorry, I, I have to go to the office for a little while. - Why? - Because there's some complications with the Haley Preston contract and we need to lock her today. Look I, I, I have a, a late check out for us so you can just hang out here and, and enjoy the pool and maybe get a nice long massage and then just hop in my car when you're done and come home. I promise you I'll, I'll make it up to you at dinner tonight okay? - Sure. - Thank you. Thank you for being so understanding. And I promise you, once we get Haley booked on this campaign my life will become so much more predictable. I promise. - Megan looks a little tired after the wedding. - No she doesn't, she's fine. - You don't think it's weird though that Georgia didn't have any friends there? - Yeah it's completely bizarre. - What? You said before it wasn't strange at all that not everyone in LA has $500 to spend on a plane ticket. - I know I did but apparently that's the wrong answer because you're asking me again. - Oh okay. They probably all think the marriage won't last anyway. Megan, come on. That a girl. - Okay nine two point. I don't see here, oh there it is. - Yes, right, there it is, okay. Good. So what about residuals? - Uh residuals, let's see here. - Knock, knock. - Hey. Honey what are you doing here? - Sorry for interrupting. I thought maybe you two would like something to nibble on. - Oh that's nice, thanks. - Oh is this your new spokesman, Haley Preston? - Yeah and she's even prettier in real life if you can imagine that. - So you decided not to get a massage huh? - Well I felt guilty enjoying myself with you two stuck here on a Sunday. - Well we're actually used to it. We've spent many nights and long weekends cooped up in here haven't we? - Hey honey we're still like an hour from being done here. - Oh that's fine. Um, I'll just hang out, check e-mail maybe if, if there's someone's computer I could use. - Uh yeah you're welcome to use mine. My office door's unlocked. - Thanks Zenya. - You're welcome. - Okay. Alright, this one's for me for later. Now.. Umm. - Mmmph. Well, well, well. You'd will be a good match if you are tall and fit. Really? Clean cut and professional, that's Bryant. Bachelor's degree or higher, that's Bryant. And are the kind of guy who can have as much fun singing karaoke and drinking beer as you do wine tasting the finest wines in the Napa Valley. Favourite date spot. Watching autumn leaves fall in Martha's Vineyard. Just stupid. - Well, we're finally done. I am returning him to you the way I found him. - Thank you. Thanks for letting me check my e-mail. - I have been wanting to bring you here for a long time. - Hmm. You know what else I hear is beautiful and I've never, I've never been but um, Martha's Vineyard. - It's incredible! We should go. - You've been there? - Yeah twice. Late October is the best. - With Virginia and Megan? - No, no they couldn't come. - Um, it's tough you know with Megan in school and... It's Virginia. - Let it go to voice mail. Uhhh. It might be about Megan. Hey Virginia. - Hey. Two things real quick. Do you and Georgia want to come to Nick's birthday celebration on the 26th? He let Megan pick the place so we're going to Lenny's Pizza. Okay, you want to grab a pizza with Nick, Megan and Virginia on the 26th? - Sure. - Yeah, great, we're in. - Great. Also um, Megan's softball game isn't next Thursday, it's the Thursday after, that paper she brought home was wrong. - Um, really? That's the 9th and I'm on a company retreat in Dallas. - So you're going to miss it? - I have no choice, you know that. Alright. I'll tell her you're not going to be there. - Virginia. - Talk to you later. - She acts like I try to miss out on doing things with Megan. It's very irritating. - Mmm. So you're going to Dallas? - Yeah, Thursday after next. I'm sorry if I forgot to mention it to you, must have slipped my mind. - It's no problem. - Virginia doesn't realize how big of a deal this is. It's the only time all year that all the execs from all the branches get together. We always go. - You and David and Zenya? - Yeah. - What, what do you guys do there? - About half the time it's work, just revenue goals, five year plans, stuff like that, getting everybody on the same page and then the other time we're just you know, doing typical bonding activities, indoor rock climbing, stuff like that. You know maybe I could go with you. I've never been to Texas. - Oh sweetie I'd love that but um, it's for employees only, no spouses. Part of me thinks the president did that on purpose because he wants to spend a little less time with his wife. Hey, it's just going to be for two days okay? - Thanks for inviting us over Rebecca - Sure. I've been wanting to have you over since you moved into town. Megan speaks very highly of you. - Well that's very nice. It's hard on kids when their parents divorce. - Megan handled it really well. We all sort of saw it coming I guess. - Why was that? - Well Bryant worked all the time and Virginia she always seemed so unhappy. But now that he's gotten to where he is at the ad agency hopefully he can relax a little bit. - Hmm, he still works a lot. - Are you okay with it or... - Oh yeah I am. Bryant loves his job. I guess the only thing that makes me feel a little insecure is how much time he spends with his co-workers. - Do you mean Zenya? - Oh you know her. - Oh yeah, we went a few times back at um, different events. - You mean when they were dating? - Yeah. I'm sorry, I wasn't sure if you knew. - Oh yeah. Bryant and I tell each other everything. Did you ever go with them to Martha's Vineyard? - No, no, no, just local stuff. Recitals for the girls, dinner, stuff like that. Mmppph. - Oh, I'll be right back. - Are you mad about something? - No, of course not honey. Why don't you go start the movie? I'll be in in a minute. Why should I be mad, just cause your father lies about who he's screwing! What the hell are you doing? - Just waiting for you so that... - You don't use someone's laptop without asking. This is off limits to you. - Mom lets me use hers. - Well then I guess she's just a saint. Maybe she should teach you some manners. - You are not my real mom - Megan. - Hello. - Mom, when can you pick me up? - Why honey, did something happen? I like her at first and it was going well but Georgia's being mean to me. - Mean to you how? - I'll tell you later. Just come pick me up okay? - Okay sweetheart, I can leave right away. - Okay, but drive fast. Even if you have to get a speeding ticket. - Megan please open the door, I want to apologize. - I don't want to talk to you. - I am so sorry for yelling at you. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. - Well you did. - Yeah, I made a mistake. We all make mistakes, right? And when we do, we have to fix them. Will you let me do that? - How? - Well, how about I buy you that video game you were telling me about? Promise not to be mad at me then? - The video game costs $17. And then there's tax. - Okay. That ought to cover the tax. Are we friends again? Now give me a hug. And look um, now that we've made up we're not going to talk about this to anyone else ever, okay? - Uh mmm. - Not even your mom or dad. Cause it's between us and we worked it all out right? Okay good girl. - Hey. You got a second to come to my office? We got to chat about overnights. - Yeah. You know what? I'll just, I'll be there in a sec okay? Hmm, well hello. - Virginia hi, what's going on? Did you get off early? - No, Megan called me to come and get her early, she was very upset. What happened sweetie? - Nothing. - Nothing? - Well, we had a misunderstanding about the laptop earlier but we got that all worked out didn't we? - You got that upset over a laptop? - We were at the park earlier. I think she just may be a little bit tired. But the misunderstanding was all my fault. But we're all good now. - Well, we better get going. - You're welcome to stay for coffee. - That's fine, I have some things I have to get to at home, but uh, thanks anyway. - Okay. Oh sweetie, oh I'll see you soon okay? Bye. - Hi Mark, I'm Zenya. How are you? I'm much better now. - Why don't you want to tell me what Georgia said to make you so upset? - I'm not upset at her anymore. Can we go to the video store? - Sure, why? - I want to buy that game. - Ah, where did you get all that money? From Georgia? - Yeah. She wanted to make it up to me. - Huh. - "I'd love to meet you. Can I take you out to dinner this week?" - "Honestly I'm not sure I'm ready. "It seems like every time I go out on one of these Internet dates I realize I'm not over my ex." You little... I knew it. "I can relate. How long has it been for you?" "Over a year, pathetic I know." Damn right it's pathetic. "Not at all. You must have really loved him." - "I did and we still work together, which makes it hard." I told you, men can't be trusted. They're all the same Georgia. That's what I tried to tell you when you were a little girl just so you wouldn't make the same mistakes I did. - This isn't about you. This is about that whore. Why does this keep happening to me? - Oh come on! This is so not cool. I do not like losing to you. Come on, stop it. - Ah ha! - Hey sweetie. - Where have you been? - I had a late meeting at the office. Why? - Is that really where you were or did you have a happy ending happy hour? - Okay, first of all, I don't really appreciate how you're speaking to me and second of all, I have no clue what you're talking about. - You said nothing ever happened with Zenya, but it did. Who told you that? - Lidia's mom. And can you imagine how stupid I looked when I didn't know? - Calm down, I can explain everything. - You're a liar. You said you'd never lie to me. - I... I'm sorry. I, I should, I should have told you about Zenya okay, but believe me, it's not as bad as you think. Yes, Zenya and I dated briefly after the divorce but, but we quickly realized that we were better off as friends. - Ha. Friends with benefits? - No. - Well if that's all there was to it then why didn't you just tell me that? - Believe me, there is nothing going on between us. - Oh yeah, I am sure there isn't. - Hey Georgia, I am not a liar okay, so you, you better stop before you say something that you're going to regret. - You know what? The only thing I regret right now is ever believing anything you ever told me. - It seems like the more I give you, the more you want. - You're right. - I'm sorry. This has happened in every relationship I've ever had. - I love you. You. Nobody else. - Just please don't keep secrets from me. I can handle anything as long as you're honest. - No more secrets. No more secrets. I promise you I will never cheat on you and I'll never lie to you. Okay? You know how you said that you had trust issues in all your relationships? - Hmm, hmm. - Why is that, you think? - I think it's probably because of my mom. - Because she died when you were still so young? - No. Because she used to do things. - What kinds of things? Well like she'd pick me up from school and she'd say good news Georgie, your dad's going to pick you up tomorrow and take you to the park. I'd spend my whole Saturday waiting for him and he'd never come. There were always things like that. I never knew what was real and what wasn't. - I am so sorry that happened to you. That explains a lot. I will never abandon you like your father. Or lie to you like your mother. - She bribed her so well she won't even tell me what happened. And something definitely happened. Megan never gets upset like that. - Did you say anything to Bryant? - No. No, he'll only accuse me of overreacting. But I know Georgia was lying to me, minimizing it. And man, to buy Megan's silence like that, I mean none of this is right with me. - Well why don't you try to find out a little bit more about her? - How? I don't know anybody who knows her. No one came to the wedding, which might say something right there. - She met Bryant online right? - Hmm, hmm. - I'd start there. If he found her, so can you. - Okay. - Oh don't forget this. - Thank you, love you. - Oh, you too. - Hey I was going to get Nick a bottle of bourbon for his birthday. Doesn't seem like much of a wine drinker. - Okay. - Would you mind picking it up today? - Sure, no problem. - Thanks. - You could call and pretend you're checking references. - That's so dishonest, how do you come up with this stuff? - What? Virginia you can't beat a liar by being honest. - David, it's Georgia Myers on line two. - Really? - Hey, Georgia. - Oh hi David, I'm sorry to bother you. I'm trying to plan a little surprise for Bryant while he's at the staff retreat. But I was just wondering if you could tell me what hotel you guys are going to be staying at? Uh, I'm afraid if I ask him he'll suspect something. - Sure, yeah, hang on. Um... they are... staying at the Meridian Suites. - They? Aren't you going? - I was supposed to actually but Bryant asked me to skip it this year. We got so much riding on this Haley Preston campaign. - Oh, right. Well I'm sure that'll go just fine. Thanks for the info. - Hey you're welcome. Talk to you later, bye, bye. - Bye. - This is Penny. - Hi Penny. Um, my name is Mary Wilson and I'm calling to do a reference check on a stylist I'd like to hire um, by the name of Georgia Marisette Myers. I see that you worked together in Los Angeles a couple of times. Can I ask you a few questions? - Sure. I didn't know her all that well but I'll answer what I can. - I noticed on her resume there, there was a period of about three years when she didn't work. Do you know why? - When was that? - Um, 2006 to 2009. - Oh, I think she might have had a boyfriend who was supporting her during that time. She mentioned him once, Geoffrey somebody. A tax attorney with some big law firm in Sherman Oaks. He paid for everything she said, but ended up being a jerk. - "How about that drink?" - So you can't think of any reason why we shouldn't hire Georgia? - Not one. She was great every time I worked with her, friendly, punctual, professional. - Alright. Well uh, thank you very much for your time. - Sure. If you do hire her can you tell her I say hi? - I certainly will. Thanks again. - "I'm leaving for the airport tonight. So you must have me confused with some other girl." Mmmph. So arrogant. - "What time do you leave happy hour?" - "I have to be out the door by 7:30 to catch my flight, "but I need to pack before that. "We'll get together when I'm back, before I leave again for Dallas the next week, I promise." - "Okay, have a safe trip." Okay. - Georgia, sorry I'm late. You ready? - Oh hi sweetie. - Hi. You okay? - Yeah I just had a stomach ache all day. I did manage to get the bourbon though. - Yeah, ok. Do, do you want me to call a doctor? - Oh no, it's just something I ate. I grabbed a taco off of one of those street stands. - Hmm, okay. Okay, well you know I'll just, I'll just call them and tell them that we'll do it another time that's all. - No. No, no you, you should go, Megan would be disappointed if you weren't there. And we'll all just plan to get together when you get back from Dallas. - Are you sure? - Yeah, yeah. - Okay you call me if it gets any worse okay? - Hmm, hmm. - Promise? - Hmm, hmm. - Okay. - Oh! I got you again. Oh, yeah. - Hey. - Hi. Ah, thank you. Where's Georgia? - She's not feeling very well. - Really? Well that's too bad. - Yeah, yeah she thinks it's something she ate for lunch. But she does want to get together so I thought that maybe we could all go to the zoo. Megan hasn't been in a while right? - No, no that sounds great. - Great. I'll get tickets. - Cool. - I'm going to go say hi. - Okay. - You got him, oh you got him! Get it, oh! - All gone! - That's what I'm talking about. Nice shot. You see that. Like father-daughter. We got time for one more game before the pizza comes, come on. - Oh ya. - Should we call Georgia and see how she's feeling first? - Yeah, that's sweet. That's a great idea. - Honey. Oh good, I was getting worried, we tried calling your cell - Oh I took a shower, I'm feeling much better. Did you guys have fun? We did, but we would have had more fun if you were there. Hmm... hmm, you must be feeling better. - You're the best husband anyone could ever want. And you're all mine. - I'm all yours huh? - Hmm, every single inch. - You know people do get sick, honey. - I didn't tell you this before but um, I called six people that she worked with and pretended like I was going to hire her and wanted a reference. - Really? - Yeah. - And they all said the same thing that they didn't know her well but she was nice. Dead ends. - Hey did we have any cake left? - You're still hungry? - Yeah. - Hopefully that Geoffrey guy will be the best lead since he probably knew her the best. - Who's he? - Her ex, Geoffrey Westland. I figured out which law firm he works for in California and his assistant said that he would be in Russia till next week. - Why do you work as a hospital administrator when you should be working for Interpol? - Hmm, hmm. I just hope he calls me back. - Yeah, me too. - Hello. - Hello, I'd like to speak to Bryant Meyers - This is Bryant. - This is Zenya's sister Irena. Zenya has been in an accident. - What? - Her car caught on fire... it happened so fast, she couldn't get out... She's dead... - Oh my God! - I know the two of you were close... I just wanted to tell you before you heard it from someone else... - Bryant, I'm so sorry. Um, should, should I tell Megan or do you want to do it? - No I'll do it. I just um, I just wanted to let you know that's all. - Okay. Okay um, please let me know when you hear about a funeral okay? - Yup. Okay. Thanks Virginia. - Maybe I can come with you today. Clean out her office, get stuff ready for her family. - That would be great. That would be great. - Ohh. - What did the police say? - They think that somebody cut her gas line to steal gas. - Oh my God - They don't know what ignited it, they're still investigating. - Oh geez... - I remember when our father died, someone told us, we were pretty young... that he'd be looking down on us from heaven. So after the funeral Zen and I we made a pact that we'd go everywhere together. That way dad would never lose sight of one of us. Zen's idea. I know they're up there now keeping tabs on me. I'd like to ask Bryant, Zenya's co-worker and one of her best friends to please come up now and say a few words. - Zenya's death was such a loss to so many people. I knew from the moment that I met her that she was a very special person. Intelligent, genuine, caring and a beautiful person inside and out. My favourite story about Zenya is when we were on a company retreat in Atlantic City and Zenya had never played poker before so I decided to convince her to try. And we all know that Zenya was very sweet and innocent with no poker face whatsoever. So the first deal she got two jacks and her eyes lit up and... uh, ahem. Uh, well you can imagine how that hand played out. So, uh... - Poor thing, they must have been close. - In conclusion I would only like to say that her loss will be one with a lasting impact... - Damn it! - I'll never forget the time we went skiing in Vermont on that school trip. She had never been skiing before but she was determined to show me that she wasn't afraid. - Can I borrow your car, Georgia just drove off. - Where'd she go? - I don't know. Thanks. - ...when she made her mind up about something, there was no changing it. - Georgia? - Leave me alone. - Georgia? - I hate you! - Why? Open the door. - You're still in love with her. - I was never in love with Zenya, now open the damn door, Georgia. - Why are you acting like this? - Those things that you said at the funeral. - Do you really think that I don't love you because if that's the case we should probably call this quits right now. - No I don't want to lose you. - Well then stop pushing me away. - I'm trying, but I don't know how. - Ah come on... come here... It's ok. - I just have these thoughts that burrow into my head and I can't get rid of them. And these thoughts they cause pain, real pain. And they make me say things and do things that I don't want to do. - Ok. We can fix this okay. You don't have to be in turmoil. I promise. Hey. - Hey. So some people at the uh reception were asking about Georgia. Is she okay? - Yeah she's um, she's, she's just dealing with a little stress you know. I made her an appointment with a... a therapist for tomorrow. Uh, thanks for letting me borrow the car. - Hmm, sure. You know Megan doesn't have camp tomorrow. I think I'm going to arrange a, a babysitter. - That's probably a good idea. - Yeah. - Georgia needs a little time alone, you know. - Well I um, I hope things get better. - Thanks. - Mmm. - So what are you up to? Homework? Hold on DJ. Hello. - Hi, is Virginia there? - No she's not, can I take a message? - I've already left one on her cell, but sure. - Okay, go ahead. It's Geoffrey Westland returning her call about Georgia. My number's 310-555-0134. I'm in Moscow now, I'm reachable if she needs to talk to me. - Okay I'll give it to her. - Thank you. - So are you free Saturday? Because I am and I want to hang with you, I miss you. So you are free. Sure. So we going to the dance this Friday? Come on you got to. I want you to go. Ya, you know. So..do you still have that shirt you wore the first time we hung out cause I really like it and you look good in it. - Hey Lisa. What's RE mean? Does it mean "to"? - Megan finish your homework please. - Sorry about that, anyways its Megan a little girl I'm babysitting. - Hello. - Georgia it's Megan. - Oh hi sweetie. How are you? - Good. Some guy called here for you. I think he might have got the wrong number. - Who called? - His name is Geoffrey Westland. His number is 310-555-0134. - He called there looking for me? - Yeah. My sitter took the message but it says "RE Georgia." Georgia, does that mean it's for you? - Yeah honey it's fine, I got the message, you can just uh, you can just rip that up and put it in the trash okay? - Alright. Bye. - It's happening again isn't it Georgia? Looks like Virginia's motherly intuition read you correctly. Just let him go, Georgia. Let him find some woman he can truly be happy with. - No. If he doesn't love me he's not going to love anyone else. - If you really love me come join me. - Hi Virginia, this is Geoffrey Westland returning your call about Georgia Marisette. I just arrived in Moscow and have cell reception. I'll try the other number you left here. Bye. - Sorry honey, I got to take this. Hello. - Geoffrey, Virginia Myers. Thank you for calling me back. - No problem. Now how do you know Georgia? - She just married my ex-husband. - You've got to be kidding. - She tried to set your house on fire? - Yeah, I came home and found her dousing the place with gasoline. The police arrested her the next day. She spent about 18 months in a psychiatric facility. - Well that would explain why she didn't work for a while. - The only reason she can work at all, is because of these short stints, a photo shoot here, a commercial there. No one gets to know her well enough to see what she's really like. - My 10-year-old daughter lives with this woman half the time. - I also found out from a friend of mine who works at the facility she was sent to that she may have been responsible for her mother's death as well. - She murdered her mother? Not exactly. I guess her mother was a heavy smoker. She fell asleep with a lit cigarette, caught the house on fire. - Well how is that Georgia's fault? - Gathering from what she said, they thought she blocked the back door so her mother couldn't get out. - I'm telling you, this woman is dangerous. - Thank you. I, I, I have to call my ex-husband. - Good luck with everything. Thank you. - Crimson and Levens Advertising - Hi, I, I need to talk to Bryant Myers please, this is an emergency. I'm his ex-wife. - If you look at the designated market area... - Bryant, Virginia's on line 3. She says it's urgent. - That might be about my daughter, I've got to take this. Tell her I'll call her back on her cell... David. Virginia, what's going on? - Oh thank God. Okay I, I, I just got off the phone with Georgia's ex-boyfriend in California. Listen, there is something really wrong with her. She tried to burn his house down. - What? What are you talking about? - Hi Georgia. - And she, she threatened to kill a co-worker of his because she was jealous. - That's insane, Georgia would never do something like that. - She did. And apparently there was some suspicion surrounding the death of her mother. Geoffrey said that she, she hated her mother and... - Georgia? - Who are you talking to? - Is she there? - Who is it? - Hey, Virginia I got to let you go okay? - No wait! Wait! - What did she tell you? - Hey sweetheart. - You tell me what she said. - Nothing. - Don't lie. She told you things, didn't she? Bad things. - Look sweetheart, you just got to relax okay? - You believe her. Admit it. - No. - Yes you do. People always believe these lies but they never believe me. - No, of course I believe you okay, I just...I don't ... - Don't say that, you don't believe me. You think I'm some kind of evil person. - Hey you got to relax right now, seriously. - How could you? - Georgia, what is going on? Where are you going? What are you doing? Georgia come back inside. This is insane! - No Stay back! Don't come any closer. - Okay. Okay. Look, just, just, just relax, okay honey. - Don't you get it? There's no going back. - Back from what? - I know you're going to leave me, I know it. - No. No I'm... I'm your husband okay. The only place that I'm going to be is right by your side. I, I swear! - That's a lie! - No please, please, just put the knife down, please put the knife down. - You don't want me, you wanted Zenya. - That's crazy. Look there, there, there was never any reason for you to be jealous of Zenya, never. - No I don't believe you. She was always going to be there trying to take advantage of every minute she could be alone with you. She was going to destroy everything we have. She was never going to give up. I knew that having her around meant losing you. - Wait. Having her around? Oh my God! Georgia, oh my God please, please tell me that you... tell me that you didn't have anything to do with her death. Zenya's car, that was the night that you got sick, that was Nick's party. Oh God, please tell me that you didn't do it. Please tell me that you had nothing to do with setting that fire. - What was I supposed to do? Just sit by and watch her destroy our marriage? - She burned alive in that car. How could you possibly do that? - I should have listened to my mother, she told me that you would hurt me. - Your mother? I never even met your mother. Look, you don't know what you're talking about right now. Please tell me that you don't know what you're talking about. Please. - So many lies! - I'm so sorry for making you feel like... I would give you up, cause I, I wouldn't do that. I, I wouldn't give you up. Nobody can take away what we have. - You were the love of my life. - I still am. I'll never let you go, okay? It's okay. Oh! - Bryant. Georgia what's going on? Jesus, man. Oh my God. - 911. - Yeah I need an ambulance. And the police. Bryant Ok. Ok. Damn. - So what did the police say, that, that they still can't find her? - They think she's long gone. Maybe Mexico. They don't know. - Man that is so scary. You guys are lucky to be alive. - Tell me about it. - Dad. Someone's at the door. - Okay. Take over. - Yeah, I will. - Hi Sweetie. - How are you doing? Good? - Bryant Myers, sign here for your package please. - You got it. Here you go. Here's your pen. How's he doing? - Oh this one's yours, I saved it. - Wow! Nice. Thank you, that's what we call well done in, in this family. - Yeah it's 20 minutes so it's all good. You know it's on a high heat just to make sure that it's cooked. - So I almost didn't try this online dating thing cause I heard stories of getting matched up with these psychos. - I know exactly what you mean. I've been burned a few times myself too. - So when are you going to let me up with you in person.
