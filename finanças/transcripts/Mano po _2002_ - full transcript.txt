It's all the same level. -How are you guys doing? -Have a drink. [men chatting] [sobbing] I'm scared. They've forgotten us. The day we were kidnapped. everything became clear. I realized Chinese-Filipinos had long been held captive. In various ways. And by so many things. [gentle music] What if they don't like me? Don't he scared. They're nice. -Is that them? -Yes. What did they say? Are they mad at me? No. That's just how they talk. [giggling] [Light music] I don't think your parents like me. No. That's not true. It's hard to fit in. I don't understand the language. Only you and I matter. There. When you talk like that. I feel stupid. [rooster crows] [different animals sound] [sheep bleat] My stomach hurts. Do you have medicine? What is that? I don't what it is.. I don't know what it is. That? No, I don't want it. -[screams] -I said I don't want that! [throwing up] [door closes] [epic music] Eliza! Wait! Eliza, wait! What happened? What's wrong? I won't allow your parents to tell me what to do. I'm going back to the Philippines. Wait, let's talk about this. I've made up my mind. [Richelle] The women in our family have always been courageous. And grandma, Daddy's mom, started it all when she left China's feudal culture to go back home. But grandpa loved grandma. so he went with her. Eliza, wait! They left China together for a future in the Philippines. It was when they left that the civil war in China got worse. Mao Zedong's People's Liberation Army won. The victory of the Communist Party stunned the world. And China left the United Nations. [Richelle] There was a time my family really hated me. Of the three daughters. I hardly spoke Mandarin. You knew that, right? It's pretty obvious-. I grew up with nannies, so as a kid. I knew more Filipino. [Jimmy] Same here. [stammering] And maybe because I was also the least Chinese in character. I took after my grandmother. Mommy is only half-Chinese. -They were also mad at her because of me. -There you go again. [giggles] -It's true, right? -What is? -Her parents didn't like me. -[Jimmy] Because you were Filipino? He wasn't the reason for all the animosity. What was it, then? [stammering] The respectable Go clan thought of me as the black sheep. That's what Vera and Juliet called me. [traditional instrument plays] [crowd applauding] [announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, the Chief Executive Officer of the Go Group of Companies, Ms. Vera Go. [light music] [crowd applauding] Good evening to you all. Welcome to the 80th birthday of my grandfather, Don Luis Go. [crowd applauding] We are proud of our grandfather's achievements. He started out as a mere cook more than fifty years ago. He married my grandmother Eliza. a laundrywoman. He worked hard until he got into copra trading. Got luckier and expanded the business then got into food manufacturing. Until we expanded to other businesses that continue to give employment to thousands of people. [crowd applauding] [crowd applauding] Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to present to you the president of the Go Group of Companies, my father, Daniel Go. [crowd applauding] [light music] [music continues] [crowd applauding] Hi. [crowd chatter] [music continues] Hi. Richelle, what took you so long. and why are you wearing that? Must we discuss my clothes now? And why'd you bring this idiot? Joey's nice, and he speaks better Fookien and Mandarin than I do. -He's dangerous -You don't like nice Filipinos-. You don't like dangerous Chinese-Filipinos. What do I do? [sighs heavily] Excuse me. [giggling] [chuckles] How are you, Richelle? You're so pretty. Angkong, give me a high five. Happy birthday. Please open it now. Let's open it. [chuckling] Watch them with grandmother. [chuckles] [guests chatter] Come with me. [guests continue to chat] You look beautiful. Did you see the look on their faces? I told you they'd react! General… -Good evening. -Good evening, Eliza. -Happy birthday. -Thank you. Deputy Director Dioscolo Blanco -You very handsome in uniform. -Thank you. You look like a movie star. [chuckles] You don't look like 80. More like 90 eh? [chuckles] -Jimmy, bring the General to a table. -Thank you. -Yes, Angkong. -[soaring music] -[crowd applauding, chatting] [busy street noise] Leave my things here. Bring that chair there. -Go. I'll call if I need anything. -Yes, ma'am. What is it, Jimmy? [stammering] Achi… [stammering] I need money for my photo exhibit. Money… for a photo exhibit? Can't you do better than ask? [stammering] Daddy told me to see you. You're such a waste, Jimmy. To think you're a man. If you were smarter, Papa would have given you a company to run. And I'd be the one running to you for help. I'm not cut out for business. You're lucky you're not my brother. [stammers] I bet you he and Grandma are watching it over and over. Shameless hussy! To think you live here in my house! I bet you were high on drugs last night. -Mommy. -Good morning, ma'am. Don't worry. I'll get you pizza when I come back. [both] Yey! Come here! How many times have I told you. While inside the house. don't speak to them in Tagalog! That's a stupid rule. They speak Tagalog with their playmates. Maids talk to them in Tagalog. They hear us talk in Tagalog. That's the problem Richelle. They'll end up like you. Your Fookien and Mandarin is a disgrace. Bye. Suit yourself. Don't come back with a problem. If there's a problem. I won't come back. [door slams] I lost my passport in L.A. -Emerson, that's a lame excuse. -No Really. That's what kept me abroad. You were too busy to make it to Angkong's birthday. I like the way you understand me. I really don't think we should go through with our plans. But we've been together for three years, Vera. We hardly have time for each other. We're busy folks. When we get married. we'll find time for each other. I don't think it'll work, Emerson. Be reasonable, Vera. If I marry you, it's as if I erased father's name. [morose music] [engine revving] [music playing] [sinister music] [radio crackles] Mike. [radio static] Mike. You're a cop? I won't arrest you, you're just my cover-. Run, and I'll arrest you. [over radio] Mike? Sorry, Raf, I didn't see them. They're here! Go! Go! Go! [gun clicks] [suspenseful music] Raid! It's a raid! [gun shots fired] [girls screaming] [girl] Joey! Help me here! Who's Joey? Stop! [camera clicks] Stop that! You, come here! [woman] You want a bribe? How much? Damn this woman! Yes, we earn little but we're not for sale. I'll take care of her. I know my rights. Let me talk to my lawyer! You're doped, and you can't deny it. We caught you in the act. I saw the stuff in your hag. You can't put me in jail! I'm calling my lawyer! My mobile phone! Shit, it's broken. It's your fault. Cellphone? Here, use mine. Call your lawyer. Miss Richelle Go. You have a lot of explaining to do. [phone rings] Hello? Wait… Daniel It's one of General Blanco's men. It's about Richelle. What will I say? Hello, this is Daniel Go. Pardon us. Just make sure that she won't get hurt. Don't leak her name to the media. Meanwhile, you can keep her. Thank you for the call. Tell the boss I appreciate this. [gentle music] [phone ringing] [grunts] -Tired? -Terribly. What's this? A crazy Chinese woman scratched it. We nabbed her and she tore at me like a tiger! Got small fry again, huh? We'll get the big ones soon. Why not get me, instead? Aren't you going home? Huh? You want me to leave? I want to sleep alone tonight. Out of my way! [door opens] [door closes] Why come to me? Why not go straight to Papa? Papa thinks Richelle's worthless. Atsi… You can pull strings with General Blanca. He can do something to help Richelle. He doesn't give favors for free. Blanco suck us dry! But don't we pay General Blanca even when he doesn't ask, Just to be sure? Papa made Richelle your responsibility. You can't handle her, so you run to us? She's your problem. She says she was framed. [phone rings] Later, okay?! Richelle's hopeless. This isn't the first time. We can't waste all our connections on her. No way! If we don't help her. Richelle's life will be ruined. It's her life. I have my own problems. Don't add to them. Mila! I have a meeting at the Polo Club. Tell my driver to be ready now! I don't envy your success, You lead a lonely life. I don't know how it happened. But one day I realized I was staring at her mug shots too long. I was never attracted to Chinese women. Then again, she was so unlike the rest. Where before the slightest hint of Chinese blood turned me off. But not in her case. [kids playing] [kids giggle] These vegetables are overcooked! And where are your hair nets? Must I always remind you? Mom, maybe you can talk to Papa about Richelle? I never go against his orders. He's as stubborn as can be. Talk to your grandma. I did that once, and Papa got angry. He always has to be consulted. He won't like it either if I do it. Mama… But Papa, how will she learn if we help her? I talked to the prosecuting lawyer. The case against Richelle is weak. You want to teach her a lesson, but you bail her out? -She wouldn't know what I'm doing. -She'll find out just the same. I'm not bailing her out, really. Or offering a bribe for her. I just asked around. It's the same thing. It won't look good for the family if one of us gets a jail sentence. Does Richelle act like she's part of the family? I'm not interfering, okay? It's still up to Richelle. Pa… Go away will you? We're talking! In the past, you let me solve my problems. Because you were different. You didn't do the things your sister's doing now. [guard] You have a visitor. Aunt Linda's an inspiration. She's Papa's only sister but more human. I looked up to her more than I did my own father. Auntie Linda. Let's go elsewhere. Your sister Juliet wanted to visit, but her husband said no. She's sending you a lawyer. Here's some fruit and some clothes. Tell Juliet I'm fine with a public lawyer. [men chatting] I suppose you know why they don't visit you here. I don't give a hoot about them. You're the only one who matters to me. [sad music] Aunt Linda was the family activist. The others didn't care for national issues. They wanted to protect business. at all costs. But Aunt Linda waded right in. She joined protest marches along with her activist boyfriend, Tonyo. She took me along to the People Power revolt of 1986. [Richelle] But where's Mama and Papa? and Vera and Juliet? They're not here? You'll know how important this feast is, when you grow up. This is a celebration, Richelle. A feast of freedom! [Richelle] Grandpa was so upset when he found out. Mama and Papa were in the US. The whole nation was there in Edsa. Young, old, nuns… Common folk, businessmen, executives… That's crazy talk. It's not for us Chinese. People Power doesn't benefit Chinese. It's only for them, always them. You go there, they like you. But if the enemies win. They rise to power and target us. We suffer. They'll gang up on our business. Why'd you go with your aunt? -She said it was a feast, grandpa. -A feast? But it was a feast, grandpa! People gave me food for free. The ice cream vendor didn't charge me. It was fun! Tell your boyfriend outside to go. I don't like him. He's a bad influence. [Richelle] It wasn't long after Aunt Linda and Uncle Tonyo got married. Grandpa cut her off. But if Aunt Linda were a male and married a Filipino girl, it wouldn't have been as bad. She was a victim of the family's double standards. -Congratulations! -Thanks! -Congratulations! -Thanks! -Go ahead. I'll just buy cigarette. -Okay. [tense music] Don't resist! Get in! [Richelle] No one knows until now who took Uncle Tonyo. Leftists and Rightists were fighting under the new regime. It's likely the military took him. Aunt Linda was two months pregnant then. [firecrackers exploding] [crowd chatter] [Richelle] She never saw him again. It took some time before grandpa took Aunt Linda back. She still waits for Uncle Tonyo. She looks around everywhere she goes. hoping to suddenly see him. That's why it became her habit to look at faces in crowds. [firecrackers exploding] [crowd chatter] [Richelle] I feel alone, Aunt Linda. You and me, we're family. I want to be like you. You're fine on your own. All I have is a grocery. I'm not half as rich as them! -[guard] A visitor, for Richelle Go. -Richelle! Jimmy. [Richelle] My half-brother remembered to visit. He's not much help. but he gave me the time. Then what?! She'll stay here? The lawyer said it can he arranged. She's useless here. What does she think we are? Joseph, she has no one but me. She'll never change for the better. -I'm begging you -- -Your dad and mom [gasps] [oppressive music] Come with me, I won't hurt you. [screaming] Hurry! -I said come! -Let me go! Get in there! Come here! Bastards! What do you want from me? Let go of me! Quiet! He wants to talk to you! Go. Leave us. If you agree to our request. we'll drop the charges against you. Your case goes off the record. -You're toying with me. -No, I'm not. -Why are you looking at me that way? -How? -It's like you like me. -That's nonsense! This is a purely professional arrangement. And I don't like women with Chinese blood. I don't like pure Filipinos either. I'm no ordinary Filipino. I'm an Ilocano, and proud of it! Good! Then nothing will happen between us! -Nothing will happen between us! -Good! Good! Now, about my offer. We'll pay you regularly. I'll he your handler. You report to me. You continue to meet with the pushers and users. The police will keep after you. But you're our man. Civilian agent. [gentle music] [gentle music continues] [music continues] Hey, it's Richelle! Richelle, wait! Richelle wait! How are you? [traffic noise] [car horns beep] -You saw that? -[man] What's your problem? -[policeman] What a woman! You left me, coward! Richelle! [Richelle] Grandma was the bravest and most principled of us all. -Did you count these correctly? -Yes, madam. [light piano music] [Richelle] She went through so much. She did the laundry in the restaurant where grandpa was the cook. Her parents didn't like the Chinese. but she stood her ground. -Were you paid for the laundry? -Here it is. -Go home early. -I will. [piano music continues] -Where have you been? -I was busy. You missed Vera's engagement party. I'm sure she didn't want me there. Is anything wrong? Only that I miss you. Ama… -You're brave, right? -[chuckles] It depends on who I'm up against. You once said. when you were young You fought for what you wanted. You fought for what was right. Why can't you fight for your grandchildren like me anymore? You should know. When you fight, you first make sure you can do it alone. Don't depend on others. It's your battle, yours alone. I'm done with mine. Now, it's time you do yours. [children laugh and giggle] [car screeches to a halt] [kid screaming] [gun shots fired] [people screaming] [woman sobbing] Go home, then. The kidnappers might call. I'm scared. What if they get me too? -Do you have enemies? -None. A disgruntled worker? [crying] I called someone for help. I have nothing. Business is bad. [doorbell rings] [crying continues] Jane, this is General Blanca of the Philippine National Police-. She's the kidnapped child's mother. Madam, We'd better wait for the kidnappers' notice at your house. Excuse us. Madam, I need your cooperation. Every second counts. Richelle… Richelle, you've just been released! Where are you going? I'm sorry. Five million, that's all we give. The Chinese-Filipino Association is helping, too. So we'll pay ransom? It's only money. -Don't we encourage kidnapping that way? -What do you know? When the Chinese are in trouble, money's the only solution. [radio announcer] The kidnap victim was found walking around Barasoain Church in Bulacan. No one knows if she escaped or if she was set free because her parents paid a ransom. Welcome to our hotel. May I help you? Reservation for Ms. Elisa Cheng. Mrs. Cheng, Please fill this out. The President said yes. She'll he the principal sponsor. Excellent! Everything's set now. We still have 38 days. It's better to be prepared this early. Your sister Richelle won't have any participation? You want the wedding to be chaotic? She'll embarrass us. You don't know her well enough. -Do you? -Why do you ask? It could be your age difference. That's why you hardly know her. Enough. That's it. Is White Sky part of this? White Sky? You want me to read for the wedding? I want you to, grandma. You're special. But why me? My eyes are bad. I forget things. That's why I'm telling you now. so you can memorize it. Why not Richelle? She's not reliable. Why don't you give her a chance? Grandma? Help me! Grandma! -How did it go? -Raf, it was a success! -Do you have everything? -It's all here! I was successful! -No snags? -None! Later. sir. Here, take a look. [gentle music] -Liar! -What do you mean, liar? Nothing between us, you said. because I'm Chinese! [laughs] What's wrong with you? So I'm a liar. I couldn't control myself. This is wrong. but it feels good. Why does being wrong makes one feel good? Wait. [giggling] Wait. Did anyone call my cellphone? -Call? -Call or text me? You had calls, but I didn't answer. There were lots of texts. but I didn't read them. -You want to check? -Yes. -Shit! -What? It's Grandma. This message is days old! [knocking on the door] [heart rate monitor beeping] Good to see you, my child. Go ahead. [heart rate monitor beeping continues] [door closes] Grandma… [sad piano music] It's your granddaughter. You know what? You don't belong here. You should he out. Traveling. Or going to the beauty parlor. You should he having fun. You're brave, aren't you? You' re a fighter. [sobbing] We all have our own battle, you say. Don't give up on this one. This is your biggest fight. Live this one out, grandma. I love you, grandma. [sobbing] [sad piano music continues] Pa… You've got some nerve. You show up only when you want to. When do we see you again? On my funeral? -Pa, I'm sorry. -Daniel… [sobbing continues] -[Jimmy stammering] Why do they call you the Tiger Lady? -Are you insulting me? -No I'm not. -It sounds like an insult. [Jimmy] It's only a question, really. It's my responsibility to run the businesses, to keep them growing. You know that. In our family. we don't have a male sibling. So even if I'm a woman, I have to prove I can be just as capable. PNP Director Dioskoro Blanco? Godfather to drug lords? He is White Sky. It has been confirmed. -He's your top boss, right? -No, he's not my boss. PNP is a big group. Others in my rank could he in cahoots with him. Impossible. We traced shipment distribution when it arrived from Hong Kong. Blanco's name cropped up several times. The stool pigeon squeaked. The witness is in our hands. -Blanco is a family friend. -Warn your family to keep distance. -He might drag them down with him. -No one will take my word. Richelle, the family wants peace. Stop what you're doing. I can't. I'm committed. I will testify. I'll have to reveal all I know. Not just bits and pieces. My testimony will protect me. Waiter… Why? What will change if you testify? Will drugs disappear from the world? You used to say I was useless. Good for nothing. Now, I feel like I'm doing something important. So okay, your handlers will protect you. But what about us, your family? What if they get back at us? I've thought about this. I'm just letting you know. The best thing is for Papa to stay away from Blanco. Don't let the cops use you. They're fighting each other. Don't get involved. Stay away from trouble. [car door closes] What do we do about that sister of yours? She won't listen to Juliet. No way she'll listen to me. I've tried everything. What she's doing is dangerous. It's a high profile case. Our family will suffer! Blanco's been calling. I've been avoiding him. I'm sure he wants me to persuade Richelle to back off. I don't know what to do. Congress has sent Richelle a subpoena. She can't say no. I've always said this. We never side with anyone in government. If at all we must, we take both sides! [Richelle] The family always sides with whoever is in power. As soon as grandpa made good in copra trading. The Government came knocking on his door. This is Eliza. How are you, Governor? This is Linda. Hello, Linda. -My firstborn son, Daniel. -Daniel. [upbeat music] -This is Mrs. Ho. -Good day, Governor. We have a lot of visitors. How are you? How are you? -Let's eat! Good food! -Hello. Go ahead and eat! As I've promised you. I won't let this opportunity pass. Especially now that it's your birthday. Let's go over there And you shouldn't pass it up, either. Please think about this. I want you to supply to the local government. -Me, supply to you? -We help each other! Eliza, come, I have good news! I will supply to the government. [Richelle] That started grandpa's relationship with the government. A major client that's easy to please when one plays the right cards. [man] There's bad news! President Magsaysay is dead! [radio announcer] The whole country mourns the death of Ramon Magsaysay who was on the said airplane. Please stand by for the following details. [President Ferdinand Marcos] As of the 23rd of this month, I sign Proclamation number 1081 placing the entire Philippines under Marshall law [Richelle] Chinese-Filipinos were caught between Taiwan and the Mainland. But we didn't take sides. Presidents came and went. Things changed. but we remained the same We danced to whoever was playing the tune. [indistinct speech] This was the only way for us to survive. It's how the Chinese-Filipino has gotten this far in the Philippines. Richelle's stubborn because she's in love with her cop-handler. -A cop? -Chief Inspector Raf Bala? If she marries that guy, and she'll never set foot in the house. Ever! A Filipino? A cop too! It's your fault! -Why mine? -She lives with you! -Why didn't you guide her? -Why am I always to blame? All that we've made will go to a cop? Better that they starve! [grunting] Don't move. I don't like it here. Get well, then. [gentle piano music] To think in two more months It would have been our golden wedding anniversary. What do you mean would have been? We'll have a grand party. With a thousand guests! Daniel booked the hotel already. All our friends and relatives are coming. I don't think I can make it. You can't leave me. We've never been away from each other. I brought you to China. I went back home with you. You and me, always together. Fifty years, Elisa. You gave meaning to my life in this country. That's why love is best left alone. [melancholic music] [rugged breathing] I want to go home. Then you are going home. Get well. I will take you home. [rugged breathing] [sinister music] [heart rate machine beeps rapidly] Elisa. [heart rate monitor flatlines] Elisa! Mama? [sobbing] Daniel, Mama… Ma… [crying] Ahma… [mournful music] [sobbing] [crying] [Chinese traditional music] [indistinct chatter] [reporter] And now, one of the grandchildren just arrived with two unidentified men. Condolences. [gentle music] Juliet. [music continues] [epic music] [police siren] [epic music continues] -It's Blanco. -Yes, I see him. [Emerson] The wedding can go forward. As with tradition, it may be within one hundred days after the death of a family member. [Vera] Or after two years. You want coffee? Yes please. -Mafia. two coffees. quick. -Yes, ma'am. Why not after two years? -That's too long. -It's not. We can wait two years. Vera, everything's in place. Our wedding will be in a couple of weeks. Emerson. Vera, that's a long wait. It may not happen. Is five hundred thousand okay? Miss Go, you asked me to come here. I didn't ask for anything. Stop Richelle from going to the congressional inquiry. It's out of my hands. She's scheduled for the next hearing. What do you want from my sister? -Your sister? -Yes. Richelle is my sister. You don't treat her like she is. This is all I'll say You go with Richelle. you won't get anything from her. We'll disown her. You won't get a cent. The problem with you rich people is. You think everything's for sale. But that's how you treat us Chinese. As milking cows, right? If you think so low of us Filipinos. why are you still here? Admit it. You look at us Chinese as moneybags. Why such low self-esteem? You were born here, grew up here. You have businesses all over. You are Filipinos. Since when have you treated us like one of you? Of ten kidnapped today. how many are Chinese? Or is it merely coincidence that it's always us you get? Fight back. Unite. Let's help each other. The problem is you don't trust us. Five million, Mr. Rafael Bala. You're insulting no one but yourself-. Not even grandpa can change my mind. Richelle, just let him. [Chinese music] [background chatter] You said it was only grandpa. Stay away from the congressional hearing! I got a subpoena. I can't back off. Am I important to this family? Don't drag anyone else. Don't give names. I cannot lie. Our lawyer will be with you. Consult him before you answer. I have my own lawyer. -Richelle. -[ Daniel] Juliet! What did you do in Hong Kong last May 21? I met with the Triad. How sure are you they were the Triad? Hong Kong police identified them. Miss Go, what link did the Triad have with Director Blanca? They called him White Sky. That was his code name? Yes-. Can you prove this? Yes. [suspenseful music] [Richelle] In Chinese, I am called Le Hwa. It means beautiful flower. A soft name, right? I never thought I had courage. But then I also thought we all have to speak at one point. Not only on the matter of drugs. but on everything else. On all that we see is wrong. [Jimmy] Richelle, it's good the family took you back in. It wouldn't have happened if I hadn't almost died. [busy street noise] We had nothing to do with Richelle's decision. Do you believe her? None of us do. My enemies in the police force are using her. They want my post. Damn it, Daniel. I thought we were friends! General, we are friends. In spite of anything. You couldn't even stop your own daughter, Daniel. Did I ever fail you? Please accept my apology. [5 million pesos] [train rumbles] [knocking on door] Just a minute. -What's up? -Look at this! -Is this for real? -Yes! [giggling] You're crazy, Emerson. It's just lunch with your sisters. You need to talk. [cameras click] [murmuring] [people clapping] [priest blessing] [priest continues blessing] Why do you care? I want you all together for our wedding. You spoke to Richelle? Just Juliet. She'll tell Richelle. Don't worry. It's just the three of you. It's going to look like I'm surrendering. This isn't a war. They're your sisters. You don't know them as well as I do. You could be the problem, you know. You're trapped within yourself. Maybe he just looks like Uncle Tonyo. He's aged a little, but it was him. I trailed him, but I turned shy. -It's been sixteen years. -I'm positive it was him. Aunt Linda, did you ever had a misunderstanding with Uncle Tonyo? He's pure Filipino. you're almost pure Chinese. No, that never bothered us. Our customs and traditions didn't get in the way? Things like those don't matter when what you feel is real. -I think I love Raf. -There's no problem, then. Doesn't love bring in problems? That's where it ends. If you don't love him. you'll notice the problem. But if you love him. all problems disappear. So if it is Uncle Tonyo. will you speak to him? You go first. -Are you sure this is the place? -I saw him enter. [kids playing] Come, come! Anyone home? Anyone home? -Yes? -Is Tonya dela Madrid here? -Who are they looking for? -Some Tonyo dela Madrid. We don't know him. Are you sure of the address? Yes, this is it. No one lives here by that name. [sorrowful music] What is your name? Albert Galyego. I'm Linda Go. Linda Go dela Madrid. Thanks for the help, though. Take care. Take care, please. Let's go. [gentle music] A Chinese girl? Why, are you rich? Papa, we're not getting married yet. We must wait three years. The older sister marries first. within a hundred days after their grandmother's death. -Why? How silly! -It's their tradition, you know. Siblings can't get married in the same year. And because their grandma died. that's another two years to wait. Chinese women expect fabulous jewelry from their intended. We've talked about that. I don't have to. But your children. Where will they worship? They will he Christians. There'll he times they'll go to the Buddhist temple. -Aren't they the haughty sort? -Not Richelle. Her sisters? Her parents? Raf, I'll tell you this. When they speak Chinese in your presence. You'll feel uneasy. The cultural difference makes things difficult. I'm not eating. I only want to hear what you have to say. We're here for lunch. That's what Emerson said. Lunch, and you'll he telling me something. There's no agenda. We'll just eat. Enough. What do you want to talk about? -Why are you so mean to us? -That's what you want to know? -No Vera. What she means is. -You criticize me, because I'm strict? I'm not like you. You should be grateful I'm like this. Useful to Papa and the family business. We were never asked to help. You needed an invitation? You always took charge. It's always been you. You never trusted us when we were kids. Papa didn't either. It was always you. What have you done to deserve the trust? All you know is having a good time. Papa made me work in the business as a young girl. You don't know what I went through. When you were teenagers. all you knew was fun! I made all the sacrifices! -Vera, really. -Shut up! All you do is side with her! Why do you treat me that way? You treat me like an idiot when I speak. Ignore everything I say. Like I'm not part of the family. You demeaned me as a child. you never gave me confidence. That's why I felt worthless. People treat you the way you look at yourself. [Richelle] Admit it, Vera. You dislike me because I'm free to do things you never did. I had no idea things would turn out this way. We're not to blame anymore. We've done our best. She says we're hopeless. But it's the other way around. Can I set up another meeting? It's most unlikely. Vera can he really bull-headed. Have a happy wedding on Sunday. -Thank you. -Best wishes. Thank you. [sinister music] [men shout] Hey, wait! Wait! [muffled screams] Help them! [phone rings] Hello, Vera. Emerson got stabbed. Emerson? [sobbing] [sobbing continues] [sad music] Justice Secretary, what's going on? Are there no leads? Nothing from the Bureau of Investigation? It's been four hours. Daniel Mr. Secretary. Good afternoon. We've helped you so many times in the past. Now we need your help. Can we rely on you this time. Mister Secretary? [sinister music] They'll only screw things up. We should have left this country a long time ago. Richelle's boyfriend the cop. He's involved. He used Richelle to find out stuff about us. -Don't accuse him, we have no proof. -They're all the same! Pa? [suspense music] [soothing music] -I have to talk to the entire family. -We don't need your help. Miss Go, We have nothing to do with your sisters' disappearance. You suspect wrong. This is a family problem. We've made up our minds. Stay out of it. It's not just within your family. or the Chinese community. This is our problem, too! Really? Has anyone been kidnapped among you? -Miss Go -We're trying to help! Miss Go, Five minutes, that's all I ask. Thanks for the offer, but we don't need the help of outsiders. Then the problem stays. Until you learn to cooperate! Leave. I have to pay respect to the dead. Here's breakfast! Richelle, Richelle. [sinister music] What will happen to my kids? I'm sure they're looking for me now. Joseph can't hack it alone. My children need me. The family won't let us down. Pia and Didith are so young. I don't want to die yet. That won't happen. We'll he home tomorrow… for sure. Richelle, if you survive. Take care of my daughters. Tell Papa to take them. Don't leave them with Joseph. You know how irresponsible my husband is. If only one has to he bailed out. that would be you. [Juliet sobbing] -We're still raising funds. -[Kidnapper] Has the Go family gone poor? -Let me. -Hello? Please give us more time. Who are you? Shit, where's Mr. Go? L am the victims' sister. Mr. Go has a heart ailment. Where do we bring the money? Under the San Pedro bridge. Two o'clock a.m. On the dot. Don't call the police. or your sisters die. -We won't tell anyone. -Make sure you don't. -We'll do as you say. -No police, okay? Yes, but you're animals! You're worse than the Devil! [sinister music] [car door closes] [thunder rumbling] [tyres screech\ Police! Nobody move! Where are the sisters? Where?! Let's blow his brains out, right now. No, please! I'll talk! One false move, and you die. Yes sir. Raid! [shots fired] [suspense music] Move! Move! [gun shots fired] [shots fired] [machine gun firing] Come! Get up! Come on! [machine gun firing] [dramatic music] [grunting] [shots fired] [women scream] [shots fired] Richelle! [shots fired] Richelle! Help, Richelle's been hit! Help! [sirens wail] [indistinct commotion] How's Mike? Don't give up. I'm here. We'll be together. We'll get married. [police siren] Richelle, I'm here Richelle. [Richelle] I told myself I was dead That I would see God. But how do I talk to him, I thought. In Tagalog? Mandarin? Fookien? English? What if God turned out to be Spanish? All I know is 'Si Senor' and 'Gracias' Will that he enough to get in heaven? Keep your eyes open, Richelle. We're near the hospital. We're here for you. [news reporter] The Go family continues to receive an outpouring of admiration for Richelle Go, who saved her sister Juliet by shielding her from gunfire during the rescue operation last night. [gentle music] -Where's Grandpa? -He's at home. Richelle. Auntie. [gentle music continues] Emerson, thank you for your understanding and love. [Daniel] You decide. I'm having second thoughts about leaving. I'll go, maybe in two years, to Canada. I'll finish what I can, so what we started here won't go to waste. That's what worries me. We have too much at stake here. If you leave, I doubt very much if everything will stay the same. We can start over in another country. I'm willing. Anything, for peace of mind. I haven't made up my mind. Joseph is thinking of Shanghai. You go where you want. I'm staying. You almost got killed here. My plans are the same. Raf and I will marry in two years. I'll grow old here, die here. And be buried beside Amah. But why wait for two years? Tradition, right? Two years after someone dies in the family. It's that, or within a hundred days after the death. You still have twelve days from the hundred since grandma died. [epic music] [Vera] Emerson and I would've been here together. If only I'd listened to him. All these must mean something. [giggles] They can't understand me. Why not? They're your relatives. -You speak the same language. -Our accents are different. -Speak in Mandarin, then. -The accent will still be different. It'll be confusing for all. This is really no place for me. If grandma hadn't returned home, we'd all have been born and raised here. If grandpa hadn't done well in Manila. we wouldn't be here either. I can't imagine growing old here. I'll go where Joseph wants. Juliet, do you think I'll be better off in Canada? You're asking for my opinion? Yes. If you'll ask me, you'll do well wherever you go. But if Emerson was alive. would he migrate to Canada? What do you think? Juliet, -Sis… -Goodnight, Richelle. Bye Raf. Come. I'll go ahead too. Hey Raf, join me. It's chow time! [Raf] Richelle is so different. she startles me. She can he more Filipino than most. She cares deeply, while many of us have become indifferent. Richelle risked her life to expose what had to be exposed. She wasn't born pure Filipino by blood. but she's one, alright. [Chinese Traditional music] Please help me decide. Do I stay in the Philippines? You asked about Emerson. If he was alive, he wouldn't move to Canada. He wanted so much to help you. If it weren't for Juliet and me. he'd still be alive. That wasn't what I meant. He wanted to help you, to patch us up. Even though he wasn't family. Because of all he did. I'm so ashamed of how I treated you. I always put you and Juliet down. We both had our faults. A lot of them were mine. Here. This is for you. Wear them to your wedding. They're a gift from Emerson. From the engagement party… you didn't attend. [Richelle] After much thought, I answered my question. About whether or not I should leave the Philippines. I realized I never did that much thinking in English or in Chinese. I mostly think in Filipino. [light music] [Vera] Even if I left Philippines, whether I like it or not, Philippines is still with me. So I thought, why would I leave something I cannot escape from. [reflective music] FILIPINO [Richelle] When I got married. My family learned to let go of the fear that's gripped us all our lives. Raf and I dream of a marriage as long as grandpa and grandma's. We will raise our children within the richness of our twin cultures. They will kiss my hand. Learn to love fully. And stand by that which started as two separate streams but now flows as one river moving towards a shared tomorrow. [epic music] [epic music continues] FILIPINO HEROES WITH CHINESE BLOOD AMD MORE.
