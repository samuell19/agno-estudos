A Polish Film Institute Co-financed Production. POLISH FILM INSTITUTE This story is not based on anyone's biography. MAZOVIA WARSAW FILM COMMISSION WARSAW, 1953 PROPELLER presents starring. MISTER T The Secret Police have called me in. Can I leave it here? "DOLLS FOR ADULTS Wałach & Sons." The Devil showed up in Warsaw today. He said he was a substitute, but never said for whom. All applications and requests should be filed with him: That's what he claimed with a cheerful smile. We formed a long queue, each with their own painful issue. We were full of hope. Anyone could touch our heart and face with one warm glance. None of us suspected what we were waiting for. ONE MONTH EARLIER "THE BALL OF MODEL WORKERS IS THE CELEBRATION OF THE WHOLE NATION" And now it's time for the highlight of the evening. Please welcome the true hero of our times. The living legend. The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party: Comrade Bolesław Bierut! BO-LEK! BO-LEK! Citizens and comrades! Model workers from towns and villages! Creators and builders of the Polish People's Republic! I warmly welcome all of you to the first carnival party this year. It is a new socialist tradition to exchange greetings today, and not on New Year's Day, an imperialistic holiday. I wish you all the best as we direct our thoughts and feelings to Poland, the Homeland and Mother of us all, the recipient of our constant effort and everyday arduous work. BO-LEK! BO-LEK! I don't want favours from the authorities or crumbs from their vulgar table. I prefer my trembling at dawn and my meagre lunch I'm not sure I can afford. This diary is my final battle, but I'm not going to throw stones. I'm trying to survive, sleep, and stand by. I might succeed... Go to bed, come on! - I bought some paper. - We'll talk tomorrow. - Would you lend me your typewriter? - I said I would. Go to sleep! But paper matters most. What can I write without paper? Bloody nothing. And I must be like you. - Are your ambitions really so low? - Low? A journalist who's famous. And unemployed. Fuck that. Open up! Militia! Open up! Good morning! Good morning... I missed you. Anything else? It's terribly cold. I'm free until noon. What are you writing? A narrator. What is that? The voice that delivers information in a literary work. In novels or poems? Poems. Christ, the way you look at me... Focus! I know it! In novels, there's a narrator. In poems, there's a persona. I have to write an essay on Positivism. Then write it. Will you dictate it for me or shall I get an F? Forget it. "Manchuria". Is this a good title for an epic poem? It's perfect, Tadzio. "HOUSE OF WRITERS AND ARTISTS" - How's it going, Reporter Filak? - I bought some typing paper. - You told me. - From before the war. That thick! - You think you might lend me...? - Do I have a choice? For a few days. I'll practise my fingers before I buy my own. The march of progress. A fountain pen? It's no fucking school! I'm going to lunch. Enjoy your meal! "Manchuria". Is this a good title for an epic poem? Not bad. "READ BOOKS FROM THE USSR!" Has any of my fellow colleagues lost one zloty? - What can I get you? - I'll have the usual. The Chef's set. Tomato soup and dumplings. Perfect. And what is the price of this feast? You always ask, but it's always the same: Seven zlotys. I always hope it will be cheaper one day. He complains they won't publish him. As if there was anything to publish. He only cares about parties and women. He leaves literature to us. I can't blame him. Now I'd bet on shagging too. But in the past, on poetry! May I join our leading reactionary? How are things, Kazio? Quite busy. I'm having a new book published. Another one will be turned into a film. I'm going to the Cannes Festival. And how are you? A new scarf? I'm sure it's French. No. The 1940 Kriegsmarine. Ah. - I have an offer for you. - Well? Come to my place tonight. You'll meet a few ladies in nylon. We'll have a drink. "DOLLS FOR ADULTS Wałach & Sons." Define a noun. Go on! You know it! Kasia, what is a noun? The teacher wants to see what you know. Dad took a long time to explain to you what a noun is. A noun is... She knows that! - Tell me or you won't get dinner! - Honey, don't get upset. Dad has a heart condition. A noun is...? She's an idiot at school and she can't even speak! She can! She's simply upset. It always happens with a new teacher. Kasia, say anything. The teacher should hear you can speak at all. If you don't speak, he won't teach you. I'm very sorry, but I won't take this job. However, may I possibly use your bathroom to wash my socks? Dear colleagues, let me remind you that the term "substance" has been used to define many concepts of the Absolute Being. According to Parmenides, the Being is primordial, unchanging, complete, and indivisible. While Spinoza adds it's eternal and supremely perfect. Bollocks! The term "substance" has long lost its original meaning. Not to fucking mention its attributes. Are you sure they're fine? More than fine. The morning shift is always taken by retired philosophy professors, while the night one by doctors. If you want to hear about the kidneys or the prostate, come back after 10 p.m. Your lines are brilliant. They might get published. The Czytelnik Publishing House has a new director. New meaning better? A lady comrade with two MA degrees, who loves motor sports. I guess I stand a chance, don't I? With your ear for rhythm? You always do. Just keep believing. How's your writing for the drawer going on? - I've got a certain idea. - That's good. I'm not so sure. It's revolutionary and long. Even 500 pages. Perfect bedtime reading. More like toilet reading. Zbigniew, can you lend me a fifty for flowers? I got a C for Positivism, but I could've got an A! - If you had written it for me. - Boots! - Why aren't you at school? - Too cold. Did you write the overdue essay on Słowacki? A long time ago. Show me. I don't have my notebook on me. - But I spent all night on that crap. - So you must remember it perfectly. Tell me. You think I learnt it by heart? Are you mad? Get out. "DOLLS FOR ADULTS Wałach & Sons." Good evening. Mister T is punctual as usual. You shouldn't have gone to all this expensive trouble. The second issue published yesterday. Sensational news, trivia... That's what I like. Not overly educational. Bravo, Kazio! How did you manage to publish it? The communists have realized they can't be boring when talking to young people. We just need to find a compromise between what young people want and what we want them to want. You can earn a lot of money. There are bright prospects for talented people who speak foreign languages. Even little rebels... A guy like you can't waste his talent. You think I am? You're not realising your full potential. In this country, everyone has to screw up. To varying degrees. That's life. "Looking for the Kon-Tiki God." Here, I'd put... Here, I'd put a photo of a woman, Black or Asian, wearing very few clothes. Or even completely naked. A pioneering idea. Young people will appreciate internationalism with a human face and arse. Hello! - What's wrong? - My private students are dropping out. A watch is just a watch, but... I wouldn't say no to your pen. My pen is not for sale. Not yet. Watches are hard to sell now. I won't buy it. Please... - Two hundred. - Fine. It will be fine when I get your pen. How about a typewriter? I'm scared. Even though I pretend I'm not. I'm a master at keeping up the pretence so that I can live in this system. I have no achievements or prospects. I feel like an anonymous castaway. I miss real writing, but all I can afford is these scribbles. And I'm ashamed to be waiting for success, like a light on the horizon. It's fucking freezing in here! The heating turns on at 5 p.m. How's Kraków? The heating turns on at 5 a.m. We've got both: Socialism and tile stoves. But you guys have only socialism and deep shit, in which you have started to settle down. - Gherkins. - Thank your wife for me. - How's the "Tygodnik Powszechny" team? - Poorly. They're starving. But they're looking into the future, preserving the idea of secular Catholicism for Varsovians like you. Dear Stefan, is there a future at all? We are not analysing the political situation with unauthorised people. But you're planning to publish some banned books. Yes, like "Winnie-the-Pooh". So perhaps I might stand a chance of publishing my Kraków essays? You know, maybe they were good a while ago... But now we aim at lighter literature. This is what the Politburo and society expect. - I'll have a perfect book for you. - Will you indeed? A crime action novel about fighting terrorists in Warsaw rising from the ruins. Terrorists? In the Polish People's Republic? It's your fevered imagination talking. Is that bad? This is not a relevant subject. And what do they do? Those terrorists? They plan to seize power. - In our country? - And they prepare an attack. They want to blow up the Palace. The Palace? What Palace? You are mad. - Not at all. - You want to blow up... our Palace? Yes! Do you have any idea... what Comrade Bierut will think about it? He might like it. No! No... For the real aim of literature is to present great undertakings of Socialism, portraits of Party leaders, and heroic model workers. As the name suggests, socialist realism reflects reality... and shows people as they really are: Beautiful and happy. And the world that surrounds them is also... Beautiful! Beautiful, with no wars, conflicts, suffering or sadness. Oi, Iruś, Iruś... Where do you get so much saliva from? You know... I do, I do... There's something that bothers me, honey. Yes? I've learnt someone wants to blow up the Palace. The royal one? No. This one. Darling, what the fuck are you talking about? I wasn't... alert enough. As a result, my article on an alleged decrease in the pig and cattle population... contained judgement. Louder, please! Contained false judgement, which betrays the proper principles of the Party and challenges its authority. In consequence, it delays... our march to the bright future. I can't find any excuse for myself. And I ask you, Comrades... for the heaviest punishment. And you, Comrade Filak? What would you like to say? Go on, don't be shy! Why do you want to be a journalist? I'd like my dad... to be proud of me. Well... That's fine. Sit down. Let me remind you that the political decision-makers have announced a novel competition. The first prize is a Warszawa passenger car. Non-drivers can win a holiday in the People's Republic of Bulgaria. You can obviously get additional points for the peasant or worker background. Therefore, Comrades, try hard! Golden Sands are waiting. Hooligans are everywhere. Even old women get raped and pestered. And our Militia, where are they?! At a Health and Safety training. Why don't you write about it? I haven't been writing for a year! Really? And even if I did, they wouldn't run it anyway. Bad times... How's your daughter? When are you going to be a grandpa? At the beginning of April. You should also settle down. Start a family. Adopt a dog at least. Great idea, Mr Zygmunt! A dog! This is exactly what I need. - Thank you for the washbasin. - You're welcome. And? It sucks. I spent all day on this. You have to catch the readers' attention with the first paragraph. Seduce them, lure them with foreplay. With what? This is a totally incredible story. If I hadn't been standing behind that door, I wouldn't have believed it myself... This is the opening paragraph. You see? Don't lay all your cards on the table at once. Why the door? I don't know. But it sounds promising, while a promise is an essential element of the affair between the reader and the writer. There's no better pocketknife! It's so easy: Take his life! Only a fiver! How come you've got nothing to write about? The subjects are there for the asking. - Like toothbrushes? - Precisely. About the communist system persecuting our teeth. Let's look at the facts. The only type of toothbrush produced in Poland hurts your gums. So, to brush your teeth according to the self-preservation instinct, you have to buy toothbrushes from shady sellers. Where do they get this stuff? It's smuggled. People risk spending years in jail to bring a bit of nylon into Poland. And they want us to pay... how much? Eighty apiece, my fellow countrymen. If you buy three, I can give you a helmet from Monte Cassino. See? That equals ten lunches in a factory canteen. - Are you sure it's a good subject? - Isn't it? From a toothbrush to the system, to the human nature. A good metaphor always helps you gain popularity. - Where? - In the West. They like such figures of speech. You just need to learn languages. But I suck even at Polish. Read more poetry. Boots! How's school? It's the big freeze, classes have been called off. Again? But we're having a thaw. But the night's cold stays in the walls. - Are you joking? - I swear the school's closed. So you should have gone home to study. But I already know everything. Do you? When did Marcel Proust live? - You're leaving. - It's pointless. That's not how I imagined lessons with a famous author. - It's your problem. - I thought my problems were yours. - Let go of me! - You have to learn, girl! That's why you come here! Other things happen along the way. Don't shout. That's not how you speak to a student. Any student. Especially a student who's fallen in love with her teacher. What's going on? I'm late. "DOLLS FOR ADULTS Wałach & Sons." Who said you could sit down? Now you can sit down. Filak, who got you a room in the House of Writers? A room... A room... The key. For fuck's sake, I forgot or lost it. - I apologise. - Who got you the key to that dump? You did, Comrade. Do you know what you should be and do to settle in Warsaw? - I do. - You don't know shit. How about your job at "The Tourist"? It was also you, Comrade. So, did I make a bad choice for you? Or maybe you prefer "Kultura Paryska"? - No. No... - See? No one reads this "Tourist" crap, but the money keeps coming in. Is it appropriate in a socialist state? Is it or is it fucking not?! I guess not. Then why are you trying to fuck me like a cheap whore? Why don't I know everything about your neighbour? What he eats and how often he shits? Comrade, I'd have to follow him everywhere. To the loo, the Writers' Club, the SPATiF Club... That would make him suspicious. We have our people at SPATiF. Focus on the wardrobe and your ear. I give you one month. If you don't bring me specifics, I'll find a prospective owner of the key that you've lost. And you'll go back to your shithole. Or you won't. You'll go even further. I'll make it happen. The little bitch that comes to his place, does he shag her? Nah... He teaches her for her finals. Hasn't it crossed your mind he recruits all these girls as spies? "Manchuria". Is this a good title for an epic poem? It's perfect, Tadzio. Get over here, mister! - "QUIET HOURS: 10 p.m. - 6 a.m." Hello. The administrators ask if you're writing anything. - It's not their business. - On the contrary. This hotel is only for those who write. - I pay the rent. - No need to. All you need is write. The administrators will accept it. But to pay and not write... They think it's a fucking disgrace. So do I. Are you being serious? I'm just warning you. You can do what you want. People did get evicted for being bums... Filak, no more beating around the fucking bush. I'll tell you what your buddy, Mister T is planning. Go to the window. Peek under the roller blind. What do you see? - The world... - Meaning? Buildings... Streets, people... Right. And in the distance? - More buildings... - Focus, will you?! The Palace... Can you see it? - The gift from the Soviet nation. - I can see it. Right. Then how is Mister T linked to this magnificent gift? Maybe he'd like to... He'd like to... He'd like to live there. The Editor-in-Chief is a demanding Commie, but he lets us be. So, you're gonna write something. Some catchy action so that people like it. And "The Tourist" belongs to us! So you write your name and I write about mountains? Mountains or... And we split the money fifty-fifty. Gotta pay the bills, right? Especially now, with a child on the way. You were talking loudly... I heard you through the... wall. Can you hear other things too? No. "LENIN IN PORONIN" "On the sightseeing trail of the great revolutionaries." You didn't even hear me come in. Look at me. You know... It was a false alarm. You don't have to worry. So? As a reward, can I go to the Press Ball? First, I want to see your end-of-term report. Can't we arrange it differently? No. And who creates the world in a novel? The narrator. What kind of narrator? Omniscient like God. Come on, I know it. The first-person narrator belongs to this world and is the protagonist. - Am I making any progress? - Hardly any. Don't be so grumpy. You're underestimating me. I'm your destiny. Don't use words you don't understand. You once said it yourself right before the orgasm. Your hands are terribly dirty. What do you expect after eight classes? Wash yourself. The tap's already working. You want to remake me like Pygmalion remakes Gonorrhoea. Galatea. You don't care about my feelings. You're an arrogant pervert. And an old freak! Oh? I don't understand you, mate. You're sculpting a wonderful woman. But not for yourself. You have to write more. It will increase your economic status and recognition. That's my dream. You see? They don't publish me, so I keep staring at the ceiling. It's also a sort of pleasure though. If I didn't know you, I'd think you were a classic agitator. I beg your pardon? You know I'm joking. They're going to break me one day. Not with beating, but with speaking, soft and warm like rotting. God, if You exist, set me free from my need for privileges and luxuries or take me without delay. Now, please welcome... The guardian spirit of Polish literature and its first reviewer. An exceptionally sensitive and diligent reader, who can notice the mistakes that theoretically don't exist. An admirer of innovation in poetry and tradition in prose. Dear Journalists! Honourable Artists! Experts on the phrase, rhymes and adjectives! Please welcome the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party: Comrade Bolesław Bierut! "POLISH JOURNALISTS SUPPORT THE PEASANT AND WORKER GOVERNMENT" Artists and journalists, writers and poets should forge an alliance with the working class. This is our current goal. Therefore write, Comrades! Write! The Polish People's Republic needs your imagination. Write the novel of the century, better than anything else so far. The worker and peasant government wishes you good luck. Go and join the letters, while we build bridges, roads and factories. Our socialist realism will bloom only if we toil together. I want to drink so fucking badly, but I can't. I beg your pardon? The doctor's orders. Fucking cirrhosis. It's hereditary. But this... No prick will take it away from me. It kicks arse, doesn't it? Bloody weed... it is strong. I got it from the First Secretary of Uzbekistan. They plant it as part of their national tradition. So I've been thinking... Maybe I should issue a decree to do the same. To seed the area around Warsaw with weed. That would secure you a place in history. Instead of one fucking thousand schools for one thousand years of our state. - Why not link these two? - Yes! For Poland. For our beloved homeland. Everyone thinks I hate it. I'm not everyone. Well said. I'll keep it in mind, Comrade. And now fuck off. I want to take a piss. Is that what you call writing at night?! Bravo! Fucking intellectuals! Parasites! And whoremongers! Psst! Psst! Psst! They came and asked the neighbours about you. - Who did? - They didn't say their names. You must get yourself a dog. You must! You want to know what freedom is? Freedom. The sun disappeared behind the horizon as the sky turned bronze. Lenin finished talking. The room was filled with silence as deep as if everyone had died. Yet, Piotr knew it wasn't death that caught up with them, but pangs of conscience. These pangs of conscience were offered like bread or amber by this wonderful, modest man, whom they were watching now. Lenin's simple words finally broke the silence: Turn on the lights, I want to see you. Someone reached for the lamp and soon the room looked as usual. Piotr knew, however, that it was only an illusion and since this moment on, nothing would ever be the same. Vladimir Ilyich stared at the window. The sky over Poronin had already darkened, while women in neighbouring huts prepared supper. The world of highlanders was changing for the better. Wonderful. "THE YOUNG JOURNALISTS' ASSOCIATION IS THE PARTY'S AVANT-GARDE" Wonderful, Comrade. You have a great talent. Don't waste it. Comrade! Come here, please. We're looking for Mr Kozera. He ordered a wall map from us. Beautiful! That's exactly what I wanted. It's big. The best paper from Czechoslovakia. Louder, please! A huge map! You can see everything! It's beautiful! - Pity it shows the Soviet Union. - There are no other maps. - But there will be! - No! You will start to print them. Bravo! Look at our young Poles! They will print everything. Everything! There will never be other maps! Never! All right! All you need is a dog. Every young person should have one. - What dog? - This big. A dog is a man's best friend. It will never leave him. Never! They brought a summons when you were out. "SUMMONS The Secret Police." The Secret Police have called me in. Can I leave it here? "DOLLS FOR ADULTS Wałach & Sons." Do you have a family? No. - A job? - Not a permanent one. There you go. Now we've got a problem. Idling, meeting whores... That's a pity. I prefer meeting whores to intellectuals. I understand your approach. So, maybe you've heard something interesting? Meaning? Like, there's something big going on... What exactly? My adult age, the age of defeat, has begun to exhaust me. I'd rather lose it like teeth and go senile in peace. Yet, it's impossible... Male urges won't leave me alone. Between two evils, I don't know which is worse: An unproductive erection or the communist system outside the window. Secret Police, open up! Secret Police, open up! It wouldn't hurt to air this pigsty. There's a problem... The window... is broken. Totally. That hack writer from Room 20... Did you see him leave? Did he take anything with him? No. Maybe he left something? Papers? Papers? Blueprints. Architectural plans. Photographs perhaps? He didn't leave anything. Who's his closest friend here? Nobody. He's a poser. Pretending to be better than he really is. A lousy drinker. No one likes him. I'll read you something. Over the green line of the meadow, the sky spread its wings like a kite, while the wind swept through the land as if it had been the beginning of love and not an autumn gale. And what do you think? Beautiful. Really? I hoped you'd say something interesting. And what did I get? No specifics. That's not how I imagined a meeting with an artist. And you think we don't know. We do. We know everything. We know you listen to Western radio stations. We know you go to illegal concerts of reactionary music. And we know you have a scarf of the Nazi Kriegsmarine. We know everything. I use the scarf to clean my shoes and jazz is the music of the oppressed. The oppressed from America. Exactly, it's played by black musicians, descendants of slaves... Whatever. Does it mean you don't fucking like the system?! There's a law against it. How did you like the gherkins Kisielewski brought you from Kraków? The walls have ears. That's why you won't deceive us. You won't. We know. What? That you're scheming. You're scheming against the people's state. But the people's state is like mother and father. If necessary, it's gonna spank your arse to point you in the right direction. Sign it. What's this? A statement of commitment. You commit to keeping this conversation to yourself. Now fucking sign it. "Mister T." You're here. My parents were happy together. So could we. You're taking your finals in a month. My work will be done. There's nothing else I can give you. I know. I'm giving it back. Agitator! A pathetic Don Juan and a cheap informer. The worst sort. Can you repeat? I must have misheard. For the third time? If you refuse to cooperate, you know what's coming for you? Those you grassed on will meet you in jail. And they'll screw you nice and clean. Fuck that. Filak, Filak... I thought you were my bosom friend, while you're treating me like this? You won't last long behind bars. You're gonna go to waste... Why not enjoy your life? So, you shut up all of a sudden? I have no gift for writing. I'm sorry... Investigation? Frustration. They don't print my articles or publish my books. But they won't stop at that. Now they're trying find wickedness I'm incapable of. You know what? You must get married. Then you'll be able to screw the system. To focus on your family and long walks. You think I wouldn't like to? But to whom? A liar and a first-rate slob. I might end up killing her over a dirty sock. But you love her. That's why I won't ruin her life. Would you take a look at my new rhymes? Sure. Zbigniew... Have you heard about "Dolls for Adults"? Of course. Every respectable poet has one at home. You too? I can't afford it, but I'd like to. But... What do you need that doll for? I don't think it's for... On the contrary, my friend. On the contrary. The Devil showed up in Warsaw today. He said he was a substitute, but never said for whom. All applications and requests should be filed with him: That's what he claimed with a cheerful smile. We formed a long queue, each with their own painful issue. We were full of hope. Anyone could touch our heart and face with one warm glance. None of us suspected what we were waiting for. I want to say goodbye. I'm leaving. Thank you. "NOWY CZYTELNIK: A publishing house." It's going to be a crime story and a picture of life in Warsaw after the war. A book to read on the train and in bed, with no intellectual content. I like that. Apparently, you have first-hand information. You mean the criminal underworld? I mean the Secret Police. Writers look for consultants even among them. Or in a password-only jazz club. Please excuse me for a moment. Have a seat, please. First Secretary Comrade Bierut is impressed by a certain contemporary work. He told me he'd like to ask your advice. My advice? Yes. The First Secretary values your judgement. - My judgement? - It's a detail. Quite important though. Is "Manchuria" a good title for an epic poem? In my humble opinion, it's absolutely perfect. Comrade Bierut thinks so too. We will sign a contract for this little book of yours. No need to put it off. Let's do it right away. "DOLLS FOR ADULTS Wałach & Sons." What's the title? "The Good One." No doubt. So?
