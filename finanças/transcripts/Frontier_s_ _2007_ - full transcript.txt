My name is Yasmin. I'm three months pregnant. According to the constitution, everyone is created equal. But this is not what happens in my world. I don't want to bring my baby into a world full of prejudice and hatred! I decided to protect my baby from this type of environment. FRONTIER It' my choice... On the second round of the Presidential elections... The crowd's anger... and the action by the police... set off the riots... against the right wing political party. And the situation keeps deteriorating... We're almost there, come on! Easy... easy! Stop! Freeze! Just a couple more steps. - Easy, ohh... - OK. Stop! Alex, don't do anything stupid! - What the hell you're doing, Alex? - Stop! - Hold it right there! - Alex, stop, for Christ sake! Now what, pig? Don't you move! I should fucking kill you.

Now! - Let's go, man, hurry up! - Yeah? - Sami got shot, and he's losing a lot of blood! - Where are you guys? - Oh, shit! - Your brother got shot, and he's hurt bad! - You gotta get him to a hospital! No, no, no, no hold on, Yasmin! Wait till we get there, don't do anything, just wait, Ok? I can't just sit here, watch him bleed to death and do nothing, Alex. Didn't you hear me? Yas! I told you to stay put, damn it! - That's stupid, man, my brother's hurt! - That's not our fault, is it? Nobody forced him to get involved. - I guess we just go our own way. - What about me and Yas? - She wants nothing to do you, I guess you know why. - Yas, is still my woman! Come on, let's get going! - Farid stop, I'm not in the mood, ok. - Something for us to remember. - Well, we finely made it. - Where you guys been? - What took you so long? - The cops are all over, and roadblocks everywhere. - We gotta get out of the city. - He can't travel like this. - That's taking too much of a chance. - Hey, you're talking about my brother. - It's all your fault! - My fault, huh? I didn't twist his arm to come along. - You're such a damn fool! - Everybody just calm down! Look, we gotta figure out, what we gonna do here, okay? - I'm gonna take him to the hospital! - The city is full of cops, you can't do it alone, okay He is right, let me figure something out. - It's not for you to decide. - Shut the fuck up! You're a dumb son of a bitch. Tom, we got to get him to a doctor. Ok, here is what we gonna do... You and Farid take one car drive up to the border and check in a motel. Yas and I, take the other car, get him to the hospital, and we meet at the motel later. - Alright? - Okay. Okay. I rather die, then go with this idiot! You're fucking crazy! I'm just trying to help, huh? - Please, Farid please, take me with you. - You got to get to a hospital. I don't wanna stay here by myself. What the hell, do you want? - How you feeling? - I've been better. What about our baby? All of a sudden you're interested? Who you're kidding. - I'll take care of it myself. - Yas? I'm gonna get an abortion, so you won't have to worry any more. - Yas, don't do this because of me. - I'm doing it for me. Farid, you idiot, turn the fucking alarm off! You want the cops to know we're here? Sorry I'll keep it down. - How much we got? - 112,500... plus some more here and here. - You know it belongs to everybody, right? - There's plenty for everybody. - When're we gonna split the money? - Why'd you wanna know now? - I just wanna know when, that's all, - I'm not dead yet, you son of a bitch! - Look, I trust him, he always keeps his word. - Get in the car! Okay, if we leave now, boss? Are they worried, about me taking off with the money? Alright, we are going, bye. Good luck, Sami.

Hans! Come closer, my little boy... Yas! Wonderful! I will let you have one request! One... answer! Just do it! Fuck you and your father-land! Get rid of him. You did a fantastic job of annoying me. Take him, Hans! Be sure to preserve him. Let's finish cleaning her. Are you pregnant? That's great... Here, this will keep you warm. You'll be a member of the family soon. You're gonna get your own quiet room, for you to have the baby. Is this okay? What do you think? I've got something that can help you. You and I are in the same boat, Father is happy because you're also pregnant. Drink this. It makes things a little more bearable. Drink. This helps me when I give birth. One more. It's strong, isn?t it? Here drink. - Another one. - No. In your situation you have to be careful. Beautiful hair. But you have to cut it. Father don't like black hair. Father says we are a unique breed. They brought me here after the 2nd. world war. They took me from my parents when I was little... But they promised me that my parents will come and see me, if I behaved. Father wants all the girls here, to mature fast, so they can have babies. All the kids born here, are deformed. Father says the reason for that, is because of our blood, this will be my fourth baby. Why don't you leave this place? I'm waiting for my parents to come, and visit me. They promised me. I know that they'll come. Parents just don't abandoned their children. I know what I'm talking about. I love children. Father wanted to put all the deformed children in the gas chamber. But Hans and I, we hid them, before he got a chance to do it. They're all living in the mine shafts, on the other side of the farm. I go down and visit them, as much as I can. I die if it wasn't for them. Let us welcome our guest. Come in, sit down at our table. Everybody take a seat. Gentlemen, we are at the start of a new chapter, and we are there to write it. To our new mother, who is now a member of our happy and wonderful family. I am proud to announce the next happy event... the expectance of a new arrival... If it is a girl she will be given the name Lilith. If it is a boy he will be given the name Karl... after his father. Who will be joined in a bond of matrimony with our dearly beloved woman, Yasmin. This is a year for great achievements, we have the opportunity and the stepping stone... to make our family more united and stronger, every day when you listen, you can hear...

You need this more than I do. Gilberte, my beloved daughter, Can you explain to this young lady, about her future, and what is expected of her, huh? So you understand, we will wait for you, dear lady, to give birth to the child. This is a gesture of our concern. Besides... this is the only unborn member of our great race. - No fucking way! - What? You have to be nice to father, and show him respect. You're not gonna tell me what to do!
