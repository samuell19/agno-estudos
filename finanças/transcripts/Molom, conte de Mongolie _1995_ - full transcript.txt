When my story began, there was no story yet. But all life stories have a beginning. Mine began when I met my guide. His name was Molom. Molom was a shaman. He left his island to come and find me, Yonden, a boy lost among the wolves. He was still in an eagle's body when he landed on the earth. The day he chose to fly no more, he took on the appearance of a man. Protectors of the Heavens! You see me now upon the Earth. Help me comfort all its creatures and those of the Six Original Worlds. He arrived in the sixth moon, when the steppes of Mongolia are in full bloom. I must have been 8. Since my father left me, I had spoken to no one. Molom the shaman, the magician would teach me about life. One night my father, a wolf-hunter left me behind: drink had clouded his mind. Ever since that night, my sole companions were wolves. They adopted me. Who are you? What are you doing up there? Come down, little one! Don't be afraid! Down, little wolf! Come down! That's better! What's your name? Yonden. Why are you all alone? I'm not alone. Don't be scared of me! Come over here. Why are you all alone with the wolf cubs? I'm not alone, I have a father! I know! He lost me a long time ago. if he lost you, come with me. I followed him because I was a little man and I missed the company of men. My new life had begun. We'd trek across Mongolia from Russia to the Chinese border. Guided by my new master, I'd discover the meaning of my life. Aloft with the eagles, his soul watched over us. O crystal-clear heavens! O beloved brown earth! Take my stone! Hold us in your loving embrace as we travel far and wide! I entreat you, accept my offering. So be it! This heap of stones was an obo, a sacred place to talk to the spirits. Each stone was a prayer addressed by the nomads to the gods. The wooden stakes whistled in the wind: I thought I heard the spirits. Where would they take me? He'd said: "You must walk... very far to see into your heart." "The road is long... but it is wondrous too!" To give me strength for the journey, he told tales of a marvelous kingdom. Yonden, hurry up! You must be brave! Otherwise we will never reach Shambala! Master, where is Shambala? Very far away... Beyond those mountains, there's an even taller peak. In its shadow, my child, that's where the kingdom awaits us. Beyond the pass, even further, lie the Steppes of Kur, a verdant plain dancing with blue blossoms. Beyond that there's a forest. Its trees have huge leaves and fruit bigger than the full moon. A thousand elephant herds bathe in the River of Giants. And then thousand cities rival each other in magnificence. The king of Shambala is called Makpa. He reigns over Tibet and Mongolia, and over all of us, my boy. Whenever his subjects quarrel, he saddles his horse of flint, and rides over his realm, showering it with sparks of fiery wisdom. Are you listening? Yes, Master, I heard every word. Then let's move on. Come on, little fellow! We're going to Shambala. Molom knew thousands of tales told by Mongol shamans. Sometimes by dancing or chanting. he could contact the spirits. Master what are you doing? That fateful night he called the spirits to our campfire, and read my future on a sheep bone. He said my future was very bright. He had seen it all in his dream and would now tell me about it. I see you... You're betrothed to Bliss... From the Six Original Worlds. Fortunate one! You have the lofty brow of a shaman, a life-giver! Cup your eager hands... You'll taste everything! Master! Where are you? I had lost myself in the fog and my heart was cold. When the sky opened up, I walked on through the snow, At times Molom disappeared and caused the weather to rage. Yet I always felt his presence. Later I understood that the snow, the cold and overcoming my fear were tests that I had to endure to become strong. Then I would meet He they call Buddha The nomads prayed around the sacred tree, celebrating the coming of winter. They invited us to share their warmth and food. How nice it was to be with them! It reminded me of my parents and the hoe I'd lost. Come in and warm up! On this day of the Black Horse, we are happy to welcome you and celebrate the longer days. Guests from so far away are a rare blessing. I'm hungry. Is this child... yours? I found him, he'd been abandoned. I'm educating him. How lucky he is! Only natural! May you attain your goal! I shall succeed. What do you think, boy? Let's drink to your success. "Far away up in the mountains... "Covered in precious stones... "That's where lovers go to stroll... "In those heavenly mountains... "Young maidens are bewitched by beauty... "Beautiful mountains, covered in blossoms... "Sublime mountains, that give birth to love..." Will you lend me your horse? What for? To go riding. You took advantage of her! - Better watch it! - Then come fight me! He asked for it! Living among people was hard. I couldn't remember the rules. Molom kept reminding me. He said: "On the steppes, "you must never take someone's horse." My pipe won't light. That means it will rain. The sky is angry. Luckily, there was Oyona... Her smile consoled me. That evening Molom ignored me. So Oyona and I spent it by the River Thul. One day Molom had told me: "If you're sad, look at the shiny pearl inside you." I still couldn't see it! Worthless wretch! You don't you answer when you're called? Go on! Time to wash! I won't! What? What are you waiting for? Get moving! Pick up your hat! I'd given my master a fright. He made me bathe so as to cleanse my heart An impure heart cannot reach Shambala. In fact, he didn't want to lose me. before I'd completed my apprenticeship. He told me he'd be angry with me until the new moon. We didn't speak for 3 days. Molom knew how to be strict. Then, on the 4th day, he took his stick and drew the Island of Shamans in the sky. I saw it as beautiful, but so far away. He said: "You'll see it up close, "When you're old. Be patient." Why wait? Couldn't I be old right away? My disguise might fool the spirits into thinking I was very old. Then I'd get to the Island of Shamans faster! Is that what I look like? You're cruel! Will I become an old man some day soon? Yes, soon. Whether you like it or not, you'll be as old as me. Come over here! I see you making faces! You're mocking me, you rascal! Come here. Did that hurt? Shamans are hard to surprise. They see the past, the present and the future. I knew all along it was you! But how? Did Molom want me to become a Shaman, just like him? He could hear my music. He said soon I'd see and hear everything too. The hunter was disguised. But his fake ears and his dancing were not enough to fool a curious groundhog. My master said: "Like the groundhog, "never trust appearances." The night of the 13th moon of my new life, Molom composed a song to bring me into his dream. I galloped along like Genghis Khan, Emperor of the Mongols, Prince of the Steppes. Time to sleep now! A few days after the dream, my master said that soon we'd reach a city full of music and color: Karakorum. Centuries ago in this city, Genghis Khan assembled his cruel army that rode to the gates of Europe. Karakorum! A long time ago, this was the capital of the world. Its very name made all men shake. Why were they afraid? Because this is where Genghis Khan camped with his warriors. Karakorum! And it was here that King Mongke became a disciple of Buddha. Was Buddha his master? The master of all Buddhists, the one Spirit, goodness incarnate. He shines like a pearl in man's heart. A pearl! My mind caught fire when my master said: "Only you can find the pearl." So I thought: "The pearl! I must find the pearl!" I longed to hold it in my hand. I asked: "Where can I find it, Master? "Do these actor kings have the pearl?" Learned Gentlemen, each of you tell us why your religion... ...is the most perfect. May the best truth win! May you bring wisdom into our minds. Tell us of your religions. Enlighten us! I am Ahmed, a Muslim. Allah is almighty, and Mohammed is his Prophet! What do say you, Christian sage? My lord, begging your leave... I am William of Rubrock, a Catholic. If the Muslim claims to be God's only messenger, then he is lying! I always asked the wrong questions. I was too young to realize the pearl was my soul. Now it's your turn, Taoist! Here I am, your Majesty... Your Highness... if your kingdom is founded on Taoist doctrine, then your works will be immortal, for man is basically useless. My poor horse doesn't understand! The Taoist wise man argued well! Your turn, Buddhist! Life is an illusion! Power is an illusion! Everything dies and is transformed! Spread love around you! Respect Mother Nature, and her children, the animals. Be humble! All of you... disappear! Listen, everyone! Listen! By the heavens above, I decree that Buddhism will forever be our faith! Let the chants resound! Suddenly, I heard galloping horses in the wind. I longed for travels. I ran off, I escaped on my winged horse to the realm of the precious pearl. Yonden! Where are you? Yonden! You want the precious pearl? To get it, you must put salt on the wings of a bird. Salt on the wings of a bird! I ran away, Master. Have you forgiven me? I left to find the pearl, so you'd be proud of me. Come here, boy! Approach! Little one! Sit on. Where are you going? Sit on the stump. Want a drink? Where do you come from? Where are you going? I don't know. He doesn't know where he's going! My master knows where to go. He says his master knows! Now I'd found shelter, but they were all loud men, drunk like my father, the night he left me behind. My father, the wolf-hunter, wanted to teach me to drink so I could be a man. Why are you making the boy drink? Stop it, Chinzorik! Drink! You're a man! A man! Hey, Chinzorik, Stop that! You're really a man now! Again! Drink up! Do you want some more? Look at him! He's gone off with our bottle! Let him have it. Let's go! Mount up! So I had drunk like them and forgotten everything. Instead of becoming a man, I turned into a nasty, foolish boy. That bird mocked me: it didn't want me to find the pearl. So I, the wolf's older brother, told the bird I wouldn't spare its life. I'd take the pearl from it by force. Molom had warned me: taking a life angers the spirits. What have you done? That bird will never fly again. That's not the way to find the pearl. When the animals learned of Molom's sadness, they decided to avenge the bird. They sent its shadow to torment me. I deserved it. I needed my beloved master. How I missed him! Yonden. Master! Don't cry. I'll teach you everything. That day he said to me: "To become a shaman "you must learn to handle "the keys of knowledge." Look! it's the actor we saw in Karakorum! Dordjiev! It's him all right! Hello there! We were nearing Ulan Bator. No more steppes, wolves, or groundhogs. When I entered that city, my life turned a page. How could such a noisy, awful place contain the keys of knowledge? How could people be happy here? - How much? - It's up to you. - Sold! - It's a deal. How will you find me now if I'm far away from you? Why keep a hunter's telescope when we need money for food? Master, let's eat! - Wait, little one. - I'm hungry! We're almost there! Molom was taking me to the Ganden monks. He said they'd teach me everything: about myself, the world, and the art of meditation. Once I had finished my education, then I could choose my way in the world. Now I would learn writing, chant, all the Buddhist disciplines. In time, I'd enter the Mandala Palace, the circle of 1000 colors, by which spirits descend to Earth. Come here! Come here! Here he is. My boy is in your hands now. I'll make him my disciple. Good. Learn your lessons! I'll be your teacher. Obey your teacher. Take his teaching to heart, child. Is he serious about coming to us? It's his wish. He chose this way of life. When my new master put the monk's robe on me, my heart sank. Master, how can I live without you? At the start of my journey, I had met Buddha. Now by finding Him again, I would find peace. I know He'll always watch over me. Molom prepared for our parting. He asked the spirits to watch over my new life. My name spun on his lips like a prayer wheel. The hardest thing to learn is how to leave someone you love. I'm not abandoning you. I'll be back. Come back soon. Yes, Master, I'll become a Man of the Heavens, a link between Earth and the Spirits. I studied everyday so I would understand the Mandala. Tell me what's written there. Press your hands together and say your text without mistakes. "I bow to Buddha, "to the Guardian Spirits of cosmic space, to the Gods, to the Demi-Gods, to the teachings of the 8400 Dharmas..." That's fine, you've recited enough. We'll stop there. Now, let's summarize. Your turn. "To my guru, "I bow. "To Buddha, "I bow. "To the Dharma, "I bow. "To those who live by the Dharma, "I bow. "I bow... "to my past Masters..." You returned to the Island of Shamans. Perhaps to die and then come back as a heavenly horse, or a moon, or an eagle. You who can do and be everything. Soon I too will be leaving... for the Island. I'm in the heart of the Palace of the Gods. The spirits draw me to you. In my meditation, I can see you, Master. On the bark you etched: "Long life to Yonden." In your prayer, you entrusted my name to the river's holy waters. Behind me is the city. Before me, the steppes. I'll wander the world, celebrating the joys and beauties of this life. You taught me everything, Master. Now I know my heart is a pearl that lights my way and brightens the whole universe. The eagle soars above me. You are still with me, Master.
