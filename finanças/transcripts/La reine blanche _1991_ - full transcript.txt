THE WHITE QUEEN Turn it off, I've got something. What're you doing, my God! It's me. There are clients in the shop. Can't your girl do it? For the bath. Fair enough! Do you want to finish? Because this one can't even weld an inch cleanly. You're eating the butts? I stopped smoking, Mr. Lucien. I don't care. Give me one, if you want me to do your job. You're a good boy, Pipot. An idiot, but a good boy. MODERN COMFORT Ma'am, sir, you've come for a sink, right? No. It's not for a basin? It's for her. It's for this one. Ah! The bathtub? This is a nice one. Stop! You're getting bubbles in her eyes! No! It's you! Stop it, you two, you'll drown her! Can we come in? No! No! Here it is. The door! We're freezing! Mrs. Ripoche. Two minutes. Look here, I'll prove it to you. A bathtub uses less water. You need a fair bit. Yes, you need a bit. How many liters there, sir? There, I'd say... 80, maybe 100 liters? Hundred! On the dot. Do you have children? -Yes. -Seven, at the moment. Seven children? That's incredible! Imagine what you'll save. Ma'am, when you wash them, how much water do you use? I don't know... Let's say... two buckets per head. One to clean, one to rinse. Calculate. Five liters per bucket, by two, by seven, that's 70. For seven days, just for the snout. Without counting the parents. How much per month? Say it. You're very loud. Lots of water. You're spilling! Whereas with my bathtub, which is full, you throw in your rascals, leave them an hour. They'll be squeaky clean for two weeks! And their heads, while you're there. Not the head! No, don't get out! Now, for the shower. Ah! It's great for lice. What are we eating? Soup. Soup. No! Not soup! Quiet, all of you! You can eat what you want when you're adults. Here, you eat what you're given. Do as I do, think of those who don't have anything. That'll make you eat. Lucien, you'll never guess. You offloaded the bathtub to the Maréchins. I sold them the whole catalog: bathtub, shower, 500 liter tank. Four hundred grand. It was a good idea to get you then. Yes, because it was the last time. When will you stop these shows? -Oh,Lili... -Don't call me Lili, I hate it! Pauline. Today it was just the kids, what happens when it's me? I got it so you could enjoy it. To enjoy it? Don't say that. No! Nor for the dining room-turned-showroom, Nobody asked you to put your bathtub in Mom's room, or to put Dad in the attic! It was his idea! Yeah, I don't mind it. I'm sure you do. Give me the key and I'll see. You know I like to organize things my own way. You're going to set fire to the house, smoking in your hideout. That's not true. I promised your mother, I've kept my word. He hasn't bought cigarettes in ten years. No, but you're not collecting cigarette butts to make jam. It's embarrassing. Why do you collect butts like a hobo? Enough! Leave Lucien alone. For the bathroom, I apologize. Let's change the subject. I saw the St Marie go past on the way back from the tropics. What a boat! They re-painted it and it's off again. One of them's in our class. A what? Uh... a negro. We've got one as well. Must be the same family. Don't say negro. Just say 'a black', please. They're more milk chocolate. Yes, their name is from Brittany. Their name is Legaloudec. What is their name? Legaloudec, I said. Did you see his parents? Yes, his mother picked him up from school. She's a pure black! It was funny, she has a hat like a pineapple. Did you see his father? No, why? Never mind. When you've finished your soup, get some dessert or cheese and go to bed. No! We can't go to bed before Pauline. We haven't done anything. Exactly, do as we say! I'm going to bed. Who's Legaloudec? Nobody. There are bad ones. Okay, go to bed now. Take your stupid magazines. Not her, it's our turn to wash the dishes. Did you cut yourself? No, it's nothing. Who's Legaloudec? They're worried about him, mom and dad. He's a shady character, you wouldn't know him. Is he dangerous? No. They've all known each other a long time. Is that all? They should be happy then. I wouldn't have a clue. He left 20 years ago. Was he mom's lover? Yes and no. He and your dad both liked Lili since pre-school. As well as others. But for her, it was just those two who counted. So, she had two lovers? At that time, yes, it was a problem. And it didn't get any better. They got into fights over her. Without her, I'm sure they would have been best friends. It's a strange story. Keep washing, I've got nothing to dry. They were exactly the same. They would have done anything for her. Like what? Anything you can imagine, just to be different. Climbing cranes, eating worms. Whatever one did, the other did as well. It went on for a while. She could never decide. Lucky lady! Boys don't do that for me, the pigs. Don't worry, it'll happen. Boys are complete fools when they're in love. So, why did she choose dad? Legaloudec chickened out? No, all I know is that Legaloudec, like your dad, liked boats. They planned on conquering the world for Lili. It's classic. They wanted everything. As I did. But there were two of them. And dad won the prize! And the other one left on the boats. When was that? The year your mom was carnival queen. She was beautiful. I would have been upset to have missed out on her. It seems to have worked out for dad. Go to bed, Pauline. You need to sleep. Off to bed. I can't sleep either. That's no reason to prevent me from sleeping. Were you sleeping? How could I? Listening to you rolling around. I'm wondering if they're his kids. Why do you say that? Maybe he adopted them. And the woman? Maybe he adopted her? Maybe it's a nanny. You need to know if it's him first. Who else? I only know one Legaloudec. It's him then. Let me sleep now. I'll see tomorrow. Sir? Who are you looking for? Hello. Is Mr. Legaloudec... Is it him who came back? Yes, I'll call him. No, it's okay, I'll come back. What is it? Hello, sir. He wanted to see dad. Well, I don't want to bother you. No, not at all. Come in. Don't mind the mess, it was so dirty before. Sit down, I'll get him. Yvon! Someone wants to see you. Who? Yeah? Jeannot Ripoche! My old scallywag! Don't move, I'm coming. Ah! Jeannot! He's happy to see you. -Is this it? -Yes. You didn't waste any time. How did you know? It was an instinct. I smelled it! Come here! Ow! My ribs! And mine? Let me see. You've gotten fat, my old boy! You can talk. You were thin as a bike spoke. Annabelle, Mireille, what do you think of him? I imagined him just like that, a pair, you two. See, she already knows you. I told them about our adventures! -Not everything, I hope? -But of course. And you? Do you have any kids? Yes, four. Two boys, two girls. Better than me. I've got three. Two boys and... this one. My princess! As you can see, she's special. You're right, she's pretty. It's like getting rotten drunk, nothing like a mix. Are you thirsty? This calls for a drink! Sure. Do you want some punch? No, don't move, finish this. We'll go to Collette's. Is it still there? Yes, but it's changed. It'll be good to drink a real Pernod. Thanks for your kindness. Stop with the formalities! Go ahead. Bye, my loves. So, you're back with your fortune? You saw! Fortune made... fortune lost. Things change quickly there. Even still. In 20 years, with your audacity... Ah, you want to know if I hit the jackpot over there. I returned with nothing. Everything you saw: my wife, my children, the house Aunt Rosette left me. What are you going to do? I don't know. One thing I've learned, I know how to get by. I'm sure you do! By the way, now that you're settled... Oh, you know... Ah yes! Establishment Soulas-Ripoche. It's prestigious! So, you're the boss? I guess, Lucien is getting on. Ah, Lucien! Mr. Soulas. It'll be good to see him. He'll be happy as well. He liked you. Ah, yes. Everybody did back then. Go on. FRESHNESS CAFE Ladies, gents! You liked me as well, Mrs. Collette. You don't recognize me? What do you want? The head's okay, but her hearing isn't. Yvon Legaloudec, you don't remember? I didn't recognize you! Weren't you in prison? He left on the boats. They don't always return from the boats. What will it be then? Same as before, two double Pernods. You remember that? Yes, I do. What was I saying... Ah, yes. Your business. Seems to be going well. It's true. And I've opened a shop below the house. In Mrs. Soulas's dining room? It's a big investment. I'm sure it is. Hey! You still got that ball game? What were we talking about? Yes, you were talking about the work, which cost an arm and a leg. We had to do it. But it takes up a big part of our budget. Shame. I was wondering if you had an annoying little job. You know, on the islands you pick up bad habits. I can't answer that question. It's not that I don't want to. It's because of Lili. What are you talking about? That's not the question. How is she anyway? I haven't had time to see her yet. If that's okay with you... Is it okay? Of course. You'll see, she hasn't changed. She has, actually. It's just that I see her every day. Yes. Well, that's good, it proves she's not cheating on you. Why do you say that? Did you hear stories? No. I was just saying. If you've got something to say... Calm down. All that's in the past. I've grown out of that, as you saw. -Excuse me. -For what? You still have energy then! You know what? It's great to see you. But if you need anything, outside of work... Good old Jeannot! It's not a charity! No! I just understand what it's like. No, you have no idea, my poor Jeannot. I don't need your help, I have all I need. And I was joking about the job. To tease you. When you've traveled around the world, doing manual work, I just couldn't. Obviously! I believed you! And I felt sorry. You have to be stupid! That's just me. If I'd told you I had a gold mine, you'd have believed me. -Maybe not. -Oh, yes maybe. You know, it's like the ball. It's not important. You want revenge? I would, but I have to go. There's work to be done. Yes, boss! If you want, come for dinner with your family. Okay, I'll speak to Liliane. Okay. Jeannot! Give Lili a hug for me. Will do. There you are! I was looking for you. No way! -Lucien! -In all his splendour. I wouldn't even have known it was you. Buy me a drink, let's talk. Yes, let's talk. You're back again already? Yes, but in good company. Another two double Pernods? Same for you, Lucien? Without water for me. I prefer mine pure. So, spill the beans. Well, I've traveled a fair bit. Apart from your hair, you haven't changed. Oh yes, I have. I've stopped smoking. You don't say! Mr. Soulas without a cigarette in the mouth is like Napoleon without his hat. Since Mrs. Soulas left us. Ah, shame. Mrs. Soulas died? Yep, ten years ago, poor woman. Bronchitis. She said it was my fault, I poisoned her with cigarette smoke. Maybe it's true. So, I had to promise her, and I've kept my word, not a dime to the tobacconists. No way. In any case, it's good to see you again. You too, my boy. If you dind't come to cause problems. Ah, there you are. You scared me. You could have knocked. Sorry. Did you go to Nantes? Yes, but I found nothing. How's the workshop? All good. I saw him. Ah. He's changed a lot. He probably thinks the same of you. Except for his eyes. I found him crude. He's gotten fatter. You too, honey. I was at school getting the boys. I saw his sons, if it's his wife. It's definitely her. She's very nice. She seemed nice at least. What an idea, to marry a black woman! Look, they have a daughter, about Annie's age. She's stunning. A real beauty. It wasn't all in vain then. It's better than that. If I understood correctly, he came back with no money. No money, no job, apparently. He doesn't seem worried. In fact, he asked me if he could come and see you. Is that a good idea? I tried to tell him that, but he insisted. He wants us to go for dinner to see the kids and to tell us his stories, I imagine. Did you say no? Let's not hurry there. People would gossip. I know everyone here. You're right, my Lili, I'll tell him. I'm not your Lili. I hate that ridiculous nickname. And clean your bathtub. I don't have any other clean ones. Ready... set... go! Oh no! Come on, let's go again. Look, dad. Ready... Lucien isn't here? No. -I won. -It's odd. Check Mrs. Colette's! He'll come back completely rotten like last time. Don't speak like that. If anyone can judge him, it's me! And nobody else. Let's sit down. I saw him. Why didn't you say so? Turn that off. Where was he? In Nantes. In Nantes? What? Lucien never goes there. Well, I saw him leaving the Pigier's house. We were on the same ferry. What did he say? He didn't see me. Why didn't you speak to him? Give. Strange. He wasn't alone. Who was with him? I don't know. Somebody! I just saw them go towards Fosse bank. They were going to the prostitutes! What did he look like? About your age, but not bad. Could it be Legaloudec? The negros' dad! And again! You too. Oh my, I'm drunk! No Lucien, you're not drunk. A monument! Let's make a monument with our names together. You're forgetting Rita, Lucien. She had her fair share, the pimp! You're like me, you don't forget friends. Never. That's good. Ah, yes. Let's write Rita. In big letters! It needs to be a big monument. In bronze. With naked ladies dancing around. So the kids come to watch and learn. The dog! A Pernod fountain without water! Shut up! Wow! I haven't laughed like that in a long time. Me neither. You need to come back more. You can count on it, Lucien. I'll keep coming and we'll keep celebrating. -Okay? -Yeah! -See you tomorrow. -See you. I'll sleep here. In the shop? No, that's the dining room. Ah, yes. Show me around a bit. What do you know! Jeannot wasn't lying. Mrs. Soulas's dining room. Ah, yes. Listen. Hmm. You didn't hear that? No, what was it? Dad. There. He must have taken the last ferry. Go and look. And see what? Imagine the state he's in. Didn't you hear? Go on. Find out what he did. Okay, but if you ask me, your dad is old enough to do whatever -he wants. -Maybe. Not with everyone. Oh, Jeannot! Help me climb. Lucien, one day you'll fall into the harbor. I think I had a bit too much to drink. A bit too much? You don't say. Don't get angry. If you knew who I was with... You'll never guess. Oh, yes. We laughed so much I nearly died. Where's the key? In one of my pockets. The back pocket is great, I have so many pockets. Stand up! You'll hit your head. Don't hit him, he's your friend too. He likes you. Yeah, yeah. And Lili, he likes her too. Lili, Yvon asked me to give you a kiss. Ah! Shut up! Sleep well, Lili! Shh! He likes her, you know. Believe me, Jeannot, you're lucky. He's a good guy. Okay, Lucien, and I'm not? Oh, my bed. I've found my bed. Sleep well, you drunk. I just hope you didn't speak too much nonsense. Oh, but yes. Wait. We said we'll go and build a monument. A monument? Yes, in the workshop. A Pernod fountain to drink to those who dance around it. What a great idea, you drunk idiot. If you don't like it, we'll put it somewhere else. No problem. Okay. Go to sleep. So? Nothing, just drunk blabberings. The state he's in, my God... That's what worries me. What does? He got drunk with Legaloudec? Or Yvon got drunk with your dad? That's it? You're disappointed? You imagined him otherwise, your explorer? Enough, Jean. Jean is worthless! I'm worth nothing! It's true then! It's not my fault if Legaloudec, an alcoholic who married a black woman, returns to bother us. Enough! Don't you become crude as well! You're right. I'll shut my mouth. Shutting my mouth. Closing the curtain. BAKERY Hello! Watch out! Hi, Lucien. Hi, Françoise. So? It seems like someone had a bit much? How do you know? What time is it? It's 3 o'clock, time to get up. You're not working today? Not on Saturdays, that I know of. It's not Saturday, yesterday was... Yesterday was Friday, funnily enough. Oh, good God. I slept all this time? Two days? I must have done some stupid things. Luckily I don't remember. Anything to say, Marinette? Any idea what I did? I don't remember... Good God! The monument! Rita, Legaloudec... What a mess! Well, hello! Is your dad here? Feeling better? Yeah, I'm okay. And your mom, she's not here? No, as you can see. Where are they? It's Saturday, dad's at the hangar, as you know. Ah, yes, of course. And... where's Lili? Nantes. She's gone shopping. Pauline's with Mrs. Rousseau. Obviously. If you go to the hangar, tell dad that mom's gone. She asked me. I'm going. Hey! He must've been all right, 20 years ago, Legaloudec. I would've liked him. Two days, how did that happen? What could I have done? The beauty from Cadix has Velvet eyes Chi-ca, chi-ca! Chic! Ay ay ay Chi-ca, chi-ca! Chic! Ay ay ay The beauty from Cadix has Velvet eyes Hi. Ah, there you are! Well, well, well! Forty-eight hours later. That's a new record! I didn't even realize. We did! Liliane was worried, she called the doctor. Dr. Pitrou? Yes, Dr. Pitrou. He had to hold his nose! He wanted to examine you. The diagnosis didn't take long. He said to leave it to nature. Nature makes everything better. Don't take advantage, It'll kill you. Wow, the Legaloudec girl would be a queen on your float. Don't you think you've annoyed us enough? Give him some ideas while you're there. I was just saying, because... you don't forget a girl like that very quickly. You think I've worked myself sick on all my days off, just so that we put can her on my float? Do you know her? No, I don't. Yvon showed me photos, she's quite something. Not as beautiful as Lili on my float, but still not bad. Anyway, there's no chance she'll be crowned at Nantes. Peanuts? Grilled peanuts. Ask for the home-made grilled peanuts. And the little balls of future champions. Peanuts... Lili! My little queen! You've gotten more beautiful. Hello. Liliane Soulas! Don't be like that! Not even a little kiss for a friend? You're afraid of me? This is embarrassing for me. Is he bothering you, ma'am? That's my girlfriend. You prefer your bathroom salesman. Yes, ma'am, yes, sir. She married a plumber, the queen of Nantes! How lucky! Imagine if you'd chosen me. Well, today I would have sent you here to sell peanuts in front of all these snobs who turn their noses up at you. And in Trentemoult? Do you even realize who'd recognize you? The white queen, for God's sake! They'd be flattered to buy peanuts from the carnival queen. Only, she chose the hard-working one. The one who used her dad to share it all with her. He's different to sailors! He's rich, you know, Yvon Legaloudec. He's rolling in it. What's going on here? He's no wimp. He took on the world and traveled the seas. His kids might not be white, but he doesn't need to be cuddled. And when he caresses his woman, she doesn't flinch, like the queen of imbeciles! My turn, Yvon. She's not loved by everyone. She's trapped as Liliane Ripoche, you're right. But who's fault is it? Did Jean and Yvon ever ask themselves if Lili wanted something else? Lili, who you beat each other up for? It's easy to blame Lili. She married her admirer, but better him than you. Not that she had a choice. At least he stayed! I can explain. No. You preferred boats. Don't blame me for staying when you just left me here. Lili... listen... There is no Lili. And I'll tell you why, Yvon. For 20 years I've been thinking about you, but it would've been the same if you were him! I would've preferred Jean. As long as I can remember, I've loved you both. But I've never been able to choose. I was afraid of hurting you both. You made my decision for me! Leaving without so much as a word. It's not true! And Jean consoled Lili. Let me explain! There's nothing to explain. And stop calling me Lili! I swear, it's not true. You just said that you left on a whim. It was your choice to leave! It's my fault, I was stupid enough to always stare at the wallpaper before going to sleep. -The wallpaper? -Yes! Torn, on the wall on my side. It was blue at the bottom, like the sea in between the continents. Exactly. I'll change it now. No, Lili, listen... Leave me alone. Lili? Come on. When did you arrive? Did you hear? Not everything. Well, now you know your dad's pedigree. Keep selling those things. Go! Well, Napoleon, that was a disaster. Four Hop la Five Hop la, hop la Hop la -Hello. -Hi. You're alive then, dad? I was making an omelet. I thought you were coming back late. That's your specialty? I gave some to Pauline, she ate it. So, she prefers you? You didn't say hi to mom, boys. Hi, mom. Is that a cake, mom? -You brought a cake? -What is it? How was it? Not great. I saw Yvon Legaloudec. He was selling peanuts with a horrible monkey. His poor daughter! I'll get changed. Start without me. He's not so great after all then. It's a shame. But we can't stop him from coming home. Is his daughter pretty? Oh, yes. For that... Her brothers are idiots. They show off with their bananas at lunchtime. The others grovel for them. If they annoy you, just hit them! Like I did! Hey, Lucien? Not bad for a trial. Peanuts and tiny balls are better than daisies. Unless it was you who didn't inspire the lovebirds. Don't worry, honey, it's not your fault they don't appreciate nice things. My day wasn't a complete waste. I met the local queen on the street. Your friend Jean's wife? That's her. And if that's how the game works, she won that round. She looked down on me, refused to recognize me. Like her kids. Those big-heads always give us grief. They try to steal our food. And when we resist, they insult us. You're stronger than the whites! Just shut their mouths for them! Like I did! Ask your mom. Right, my boy? BAR NANTES CANDY HUMBUGS Hello, what would you like? Your things don't even move! They stole from me. I'd barely turned around Hello? Is somebody inside? You'll scare everybody! -I can't do it. -Look, it's not hard. Nicolas! Lilou! Stop! Stop, right now! Dad told us to do it! Us too! Ask him. That's no reason to fight. You'll see mom! Say sorry. You too. Say sorry. -Sorry. -It's okay. Get out of here. You too. Why don't you go and help dad. Sorry. They're not usually like that. Mine are. No problem. At least now we know each other. I'm Annie. I'm Mireille, the-- His daughter, I know. Do you know us? Yes, you're all we speak of at home. Same here, actually. You're very beautiful. No, I'm no better than any others. You're pretty as well. There you go. That's it. I'm pretty. The beautiful one, at the house, it's my mom? Do you know her? I saw her in Nantes. What do you think of her? She's beautiful! Her hair is just stunning. Ah, yes... If only she were a bit... well... -less beautiful. -Why do you say that? Just because. Look. A black and a white. Let's go! I'll have the coffee, you can have the milk. Listen, you two! The carnival's in six weeks. So, don't wait around, get it while you can. We were just joking. Calm down. They'll leave us now. -They're morons. -They're what? Idiots! Who reek of beer. So, there's a carnival here? Not here. At Nantes, yes. -You've never seen it? -No. I'd like to see it. I'll show you something you'll like. You'll see, it's the family specialty. Come with me. Oh! Lucien. This is Yvette. Tell him to stop smoking. He's not well. Good day, Lucien. That's it. All the best. Little balls for future champions! Peanuts. Grilled peanuts. Peanuts. Look, Napoleon. The Ripoches in their Sunday best. Look at them. My lords. You'll earn well. If you want to buy the rest... No, I can't digest peanuts. And you? Do you want some peanuts? No! You're too small. You might get appendicitis. Or tapeworm. We don't know where that's from. Do you want a ball? Look! No, Pauline! We can't carry that thing all day. I'll give you the ball. If someone doesn't like it, just smack them. Don't just give it. How much is it? Five francs, it won't ruin you. Throw the peanuts in? So, what do you think? Wow, it's beatiful! Incredible. You wouldn't believe, it's just like my home. It's like Guadeloupe? Yes, there's the same volcano. The beach with coconut trees. The shark as well? Of course. You should see it. Did your dad do it? Yes. Before it was granddad. He learned from him and now it's just him. It's so nice. Can we ride on it? Of course. That's what it's for. This float's for the carnival queen. This is for the bridesmaids. The queen's up higher. Up you get! -Can we? -Sure, it's solid. Go on. If mom saw that! If she saw you, she'd say you'd be a good queen on this float. Stop teasing. I'm not teasing you. You're beautiful up there! It's clear! As clear as the white queen herself. Who is the white queen? It was my mom. She was there, 20 years ago. She must have been stunning. You don't say! Blonde, with her dress... all in white. They still talk about her. She was so beautiful, they still call her by that name, the white queen! No chance I'll have that name! I don't know why I went to dance At Saint-Jean with accordions But I only need one love To take my heart How to stay in control Wrapped in audacious arms Because we still believe In the soft words of love When they're spoken by eyes Oh how I loved him I thought he was The most beautiful in St. Jean I was in a trance Without wanting to be By his kisses Without thinking I gave him As good as I could Good with words when he lied I knew but I loved him still How to stay in control Wrapped in audacious arms Because we still believe In the soft words of love When they're spoken by eyes But who loved him so My love, my lover from St. Jean He dances like a penguin. Are you jealous? She's very beautiful. Beautiful, but ice cold. She's too good for him. You don't pity him? Yes, I do! I need to reload. I've got nothing left. I was crazy to believe In happiness And to want to keep his heart But how to stay in control Wrapped up by audacious arms Because we believe In the soft words of love There you are! We haven't seen you in ages! I was with Annie. Hello, miss. Hello. It's your friend's daughter. Ah. So, you're Lili's daughter? The eldest? Yes, the same age as Mireille. It's nice to see you together. Mom, Annie showed me the float her dad made. It's like Guadeloupe, the volcano, the coconut trees, it's exactly the same. What are you saying? Nonsense. She's talking nonsense. The coconut beach is over here. Here is Trentemoult and the peanuts won't sell themselves. Get out of your dream world and help your mom. Hold this for me. The basket. I need to pee. -But dad... -No "but dads". Maybe not for your friend, but you have to earn your keep! So, get to work! Sorry. Sorry, don't hate him. It's just how he is. It's a shame for Mireille, though. I'm going to dance. Go on, you know you want to. No, mom, I'll help you. Give me that. Go on, I said. I can sell the peanuts myself. Thanks, mom. Girls are easier. Let's go, Napoleon! Look who's with our daughter. I'm happy to see that. I see. You're in to art then? Look! Lucien has followed me. Not really. I came to see what you were doing. Nothing. I'm just interested in what Jeannot made. He's taken over from you here as well? They're not always to my liking but he does all right. Can we see it? You know it needs to stay a secret. But it's me, Lucien! Think how much I want to see it. Make an effort. Why do you need to see it? You were never interested. Things have changed. I have an idea what it's like, as they said it was. -So, ask him. -You don't understand, Lucien. You need to show it to me. Why would I do that? Why wouldn't you? I haven't asked anything of you. Though I could have. And I still can. What? You know, Lucien. We know your history. Don't bring that back up. It's in the past. Yes, the past which hasn't aged well. It has an acrid taste. Some of the decor isn't quite right. I knew you wanted to cause a stir. You wouldn't. You were just as bad as me. For me they'll understand. But you, if Yvon Legaloudec said why he took the boat, that could cause quite a stir. -That's blackmail. -Exactly. And as any person would, you'll open it up for me. Go on. Isn't that easy now? You can trust me, I won't tell anyone. My God! I hadn't even sent him a postcard! Hello, ma'am. Thank you, ma'am. Goodbye. Are the pineapples per kilogram or per unit? -Hello. -That's the price per unit? Per kilgoram. It's expensive. It's from far away. Yes, I know. I'll take one in any case. Nice and ripe. I'll give you a discount. No, it's okay. I can afford it. It's really good. It's sweet like cherry juice. Don't swallow it all! It's not cheap! You should have added a bit of liqueur. Where did you find it? At the market. From Mrs. Legaloudec, she sells exotic fruit. Wow, they do everything! Should do better than peanuts. I hope for her sake. She's nice. She invited us to dinner, so I accepted. What do you mean? I thought you didn't want to go? What's changed? Nothing. I just think it's smarter to be on good terms with them. And it will shut you up. It'll teach Bilou and Nicolas to respect other people. Pauline! Great! Mireille is really nice. Not fair! You could at least have asked me. I thought you'd like to chat with Yvon. He has plenty of stories. Do I need to go? You can just go together. But why, dad? There's nothing to hide. You'll enjoy it. I'm sure they've got good rum. Come on, hurry up. Wait. There you are! It's a pleasure to have you. Hello, ma'am. Hello, sir. What are you wearing? It's not a funeral. Hi, Lili. It's a beautiful house. I always dreamed of living here. That's why you should have married me! At least your kids feel at home here. Who planted them? The captain, the wise old dog. You're the two who wanted to fight my boys? I hope you defended yourselves? It's strange, huh? It's hard, but soft at the same time. It's like butt hair! Don't listen to those idiots. Go inside. Sorry. I didn't pay for the pineapple. Well, I didn't even give you the price. It's nice here. I'll show you around. You're going to love it! Annabelle outdid herself. Isn't it a bit spicy? Don't worry, if it's too hot, there's punch to calm the fire. Lucien, are you okay? Are you hiding something? No, I just looked at you. It made me laugh. What does that mean? Let's go inside. There's no trap. If you say so. Kids, that's your table over there. Lucien, at the end. Jean, in between Annabelle and Mireille. I'll look after Annie and... Lili! You know that Liliane doesn't like that name. Are you kidding? That's all I've called her. I'm not changing now, Lili? It's okay if you prefer. See? Sit down. Annabelle. Do you want to get the punch? Of course. Sit down, sit down. So, what's new? Here's the punch! Give me your glasses. Lili. This is nice. Did you make it? It's horrible you mean. Yes, it took me a quarter of the time it did her to sew them, Aunt Rosette. I did small ones for the kids. No, the kids can drink tap water. They're energetic enough. No question. For celebrations they can have a treat. Okay, I raise my glass to the talents of my friend Jeannot. Don't mock my bathroom. No, Jeannot, I'm talking about your float. That head must have been hard work. What? You've seen it? Lucien insisted. He's proud of you. You showed him Lucien? Well not really, he forced me. What are you saying? Come on, to our queens as well. Two queens? I can only see one here. Well Jeannot, your float gave me some ideas. Other people have the right to a bit of royalty. I'm going to nominate Mireille. But dad! What? My princess doesn't deserve the crown? You're just winding me up? Jean, please. Listen to me, Yvon. She might be the queen one day, but not on my float. You want to bet? Jean, don't. No, he can go to hell! I didn't make it... For a black, that's it? Yvon! What's wrong? Look at this clown! He's scared! That's enough. Come on kids, we're leaving. Come on. That's it, we're leaving. Get out of here. No, that's not possible! I've prepared... Put it in a container! He wouldn't have eaten it! You're lucky the kids were here. Stop dad, I beg you, come on. She's right, leave. I need some air. Go and join them! This is your fault! She made a good decision, Lili, she won't be disappointed. Stop your moaning. Bring me some of your pork. They won't stop me from eating. Bravo! That was a good idea accepting the invitation. It wasn't me who put on the show there. I'm so ashamed. I embarrassed you? Unbelievable! You're on his side! I'm not on his side, but you were just as bad. I should have just given him my float for free! What? Don't laugh at his ideas. It's his decision to nominate his daughter. You don't have to humiliate him. Humiliate? You don't know him. I know him as well as you do. She obviously wasn't aware of anything! That's it, go back. Go and console them. That's what he wants. Jean, I feel sorry for you. Do you hear? She feels sorry for me! Your mom, the saint, feels sorry for your idiot dad! What are you doing, dad? I'm sick of being looked down upon. Join him and his peanuts! Just take her! I'm leaving! -Don't be stupid, Jean! -Shut up! -Where are you going? -The hangar. Just as I thought. He came back to cause problems. What are you doing here? It's your fault! I hope you're happy! I wanted to see how you were. I'm doing great, can't you see! You could've changed at least. Are you happy with yourself? What a relief! Six months of work down the drain. Your float is still nice. Whose fault is it? I didn't ask you to give Legaloudec a guided visit. The other one's still good enough for him to put his daughter on my float. His daughter or not, the queen won't have anything to sit on. Yes, she will! She'll have another float. I'd like to see how! You'll see. I'll make another. A beautiful one! No one will dare climb on this one. It'll be impossible. Why will it be impossible? An iceberg, with the ice around, and an igloo! All in white! I'll do it all in white! This damn float! In three weeks? That'll be impossible! The carnival is the 15th of next month. We'll work day and night, the two of us. What do you mean "us"? Because you'll help me. No! Yes, Lucien, to redeem yourself. You will help me. You don't realize the work involved. Yes, I do. That's why you'll help me. Even with two us, it's impossible. And I'm retired. I've lost the knack. Lucien, don't be like that. Only you can help me. And you haven't lost the knack. You'll see, we're going to make the most beautiful float ever. Hello. -It's nice to see you. -You too. I'm coming home earlier today. For what I sold... I pity you for doing that. I have no choice. You're lucky, studying must be more interesting. Yeah, I guess. It's true, data-entry has better job prospects. I'd like to work in a hairdresser or a salon or a perfumery. But it's complicated now. How's things at your house? They hardly speak to each other. This house depresses me. All I ever do is clean and tidy up. Why have you stopped shaving? Are you going to do something soon? I'm reading, can't you see? You should go and apologize to the Ripoches. But for that you have just as little interest as in your work. Typical. I don't understand whites. Argue and fall out over nothing. Leave me alone. Since Mireille said she's not interested. Mireille will do what I tell her, period! There's no point, he's destroyed his float. Are you happy now? What are you doing? You're not going to start the plaster now? Why not? The more I do, the better it'll be. Don't be angry, but I'm stopping. I'm exhausted. Go and eat Lili's soup then. You're not sick of that yet. It's not that, I'm tired. I need to sleep as well. I'll work for two. Here are the provisions! She said that for the laundry you can do it yourself. Charming. I'm not surprised she said that. She said that from now on you can't rely on her. You can sort yourself out. We can do that. For me too? Yep. She said that if he prefers living in a dump, he can do the same for his food. -She said that? -Exactly! I'll go and talk to her. That's right, go and beg. Be here at seven tomorrow. Help me or leave me alone. Come on! We got rid of the others? They didn't do their job? No! Listen Lili... Listen Liliane... just because I'm helping him doesn't mean I agree with him. You should understand. Stop, honey. I have an arrogant husband. And a dad I can't count on. Yes, it's my fault. I'm happy to hear that. I wanted to say it's... my fault, from the start. A bit. Your mom and I anyway. What did mom do? I don't understand. Well, you know how your mom was. She preferred the genuine to the pretentious. Listen dad, I don't know what you want to say, but be clear. And without blaming mom. You're right. I've got homework to do. About 20 years ago. Don't -About Yvon's departure. -No! Please. Everything has been said. No, not everything. Yes, but I'm happy with what I know. Change the subject, please. Listen. Yvon left like that because of us. Your mom and I. Sorry? He did something bad. He needed money, he came to see me. He trusted me, you see? His Aunt Rosette couldn't. I don't understand. Do you remember, Jean worked for me for three years. He had his salary, his extra hours. I know all that. You trained him, he worked well, he deserved me. No it's not that. Yvon, other than his odd jobs here and there... Well... to be like the others, in his own eyes, he gambled, poker. And with shady folk. He won at the start, then he lost, a lot, money he didn't have. You lent him money? Not without conditions. -What then? -It was your mom's idea, I liked both of them. We gave him enough to settle his debts, and a bit more for the boat. So, that's it? You forced him to leave? You paid him? Listen sweetie-- You bought me! You chose for me! What you wanted! In your own little interests! Lili, listen. I understand. Between the useless one and the worker who likes your floats as much as your daughter, not a hard decision! I imagine you asked him to stay quiet too. What good would it do to tell Lili? Don't spoil the party! Had to keep her happy. Then... Then there was Jean, to console her. And he knew, I'm sure of that. No, I swear! I'm sorry Lili, I swear on your mom's grave that Jean didn't know. Believe me. How can I believe you? You ruined everything. It's your fault! Everything's your fault. Go away! Go away! Go and hang out with him! You're no better than him! Did grandpa make you cry? What's wrong, mom? Is it dad? There's nothing to eat tonight, you can go to bed. We'll help you. Come on, leave it. I'll make French bread tomorrow. Up you go. It's okay, don't worry. Why is she hurt? Mom's just silly, honey. I'm sleeping here then. She kicked you out too? What did you say to her to do that? Nothing. I should have kept my mouth shut. You need to speak to her. She'll wait. I'm not moving till I've finished here. That way, she'll have time to think. Maybe she'll miss me. Now's a good time to go though. Can I grab something to eat? Go for it. You want me to make you a sandwich? Not now, I'll finish this. You know, you should go. She was pretty upset, Lili. Stop speaking about her. Sitting there, watching me work, won't prevent me from working, making me feel guilty! It's not that. It's me who feels bad. MODERN COMFORT Hello. I was trying to remember the layout. That's why you came? No. I came to apologize, for Sunday. That's one of you then. I wanted to apologize to Jean as well... I'm not going to nominate Mireille, she didn't even want to. He'll be disappointed. Sorry? He'll be disappointed. He wanted to beat you. Yes, I know. Exactly. How stupid. You should still nominate her. If you want her to be happy, you should. -Seriously? -Yes, of course. Not many girls could give her a run for her money. I thought you... Think what you want. But I'd be happy if people forgot about me. And you'd have a queen, with her little prize. She doesn't want anything to do with it. We can't force her. Force, no, but... seduce her, yes. I'll do something for her. You watch, she'll accept. Come here. If you're not afraid of ghosts. What do you think? Oh, my God... It's nice, isn't it? It's beautiful, just beautiful. And I missed it. It's my best memory. Imagine her in this dress. Why are you doing this, Lili? To pay my debt, and I think that... she'll be more beautiful. No, I don't think so. -You're... -I'm too old for it. But I'll give it to you, because you knew me. You'd do that for me? More for me. It may be the last opportunity. Wait there. Ta-da! Here's the white queen. Lili... You're beautiful. Don't tease me. How could I? You take me back 20 years. Lili... If I were a bad man, I'd take you. Lucien, give me another cloth. -Another one? -Yes. Are you eating them? What are you doing? Are you going to help us? No, thanks. I went to the house and then I wanted to come here. She let you come here? I didn't ask her. She was busy. Why are you saying "busy" like that, looking elsewhere? No reason. Her dress was in the bathroom. Her dress? Which dress? The beautiful one. From before. She hasn't wanted to put it on in 20 years. Maybe she's partying while we're working. Strange that she does it alone, in hiding. You think Jean didn't know? I don't think so. It's not like your dad to lie. I never wrote to him. And to me? You wrote to me. Mom must have taken the letters. I wrote a lot at the start, then... I didn't post the first ones. I wrote it on my last night here. I always thought you received it. Until now. None. I didn't receive any. Not that one nor the others. You left abruptly. You vanished from my life, not a word. I felt betrayed, it was a cowardly act. It was, yes. At least, this letter, if nothing else, it said... so many things. What did you do with it then? It's not important. It's in the past now. But I want to know! I don't want any more secrets! Do you understand? I left the letter with your dad. In the morning I gave it to him in the hangar, he was finishing the float. I was leaving, the boat was leaving at 10:00. The parade in the afternoon. You remember? You didn't want us to see the dress. The rest, you know. I had some news about you. From the sailors. There were two on the boat from Trentemoult. I stopped asking... Please excuse me. No! Not you. It's us who should be ashamed. Me for being foolish, Jean for having taken advantage, for not searching further. And your parents, so self-sufficient. They were afraid of losing you. They felt rich with you. As we did, when we were with you. That's the truth, Lili. You shone like gold. It makes you crazy. You didn't resist? It was impossible! Jean thought he'd lost you. Your dad let you re-arrange his house for your bathroom. And me, ready to let it all go just now, a wife and kids who I love. Well... Do you think I'm happy? You think I enjoy this life? Being treated like an object at an auction? I was crazy to want this dress! What for in the end? To be more beautiful? I scare my kids now. I scare Jean, he's scared to touch me. What was I to do? Love them, good God! Like they deserve! Mom! Nicolas has a bloody nose. The black boy punched him in the face. Mom! Mom! If you continue, they'll hit you so hard you'll become black. Do that for an hour, it'll stop your nose from bleeding. What's he doing here? Mrs. Rousseau wasn't happy that you left Pauline so late without saying. She had to go. I'll apologize. You have to pay her too. She didn't say it, but I felt it. Move your things. I don't know what you think, but nothing happened. We won't ask. I know. I want you to know why he came here. He came to apologize for Sunday. We spoke and I got rid of the dress. I gave it to him. For his daughter, for the carnival. That's nice! She'll definitely be elected. She deserves it. I'm happy to have gotten rid of it, and now I'm back to earth. Thanks, mom. Why did Annie come here? Lucien! I'm speaking! You didn't wonder why she was just hanging around? You're only worrying about it now? Go to sleep. Remember, she spoke about Liliane and the dress. I'm sure she wanted to say something, -but she didn't. -Ask her tomorrow. I know! It's obvious! She couldn't stay at the house! Someone was there. Legaloudec, the dog. What are you talking about? Why would he come? You're asking me? It's obvious! Why did she want to try on her dress? He came for her. And she wanted him. That's nonsense. If he'd come, Lili would have told him to leave. You don't understand women, Lucien. Especially not Lili. Excuse me, I know her well. You know nothing. I understand. They slept together, in my bed! Stop your nonsense, Jean. You're tired, you're imagining things. You don't realize the state you're in. They're trying to trick me. They won't get away with this, Lucien! Stop! You're not going there in the middle of the night. Are you going to stop me? If you don't agree, you can join them, make it the whole family. Hey... stay here! If you like it or not, you'll help me finish. Till the end! You can't come in like this. Like what? I'm dressed and I have an invitation. You know me! No, I don't, Jean. Tell him who I am! That's the problem! Mr. Lucien can come in, but you... Have you seen your state? They're orders. We had a car crash. There! -Sir! -Move! Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please. As you know, the jury is composed of Nantes's finest! The president, Mr. Ludo, his bed shop is well-known in Nantes. And the president has just given me the result of their deliberation. So, here they are in front of you, but there are only three names in this envelope. Suspense! Look at them... Enjoy it, because in a moment, there will only be three! The queen and her bridesmaids. Your attention! First bridesmaid... Miss... Martine Rosier. A round of applause! Martine, bravo! Do you mind if I give you a kiss? Congratulations to the young man who picks this plant... This rose has no thorns! Okay, your attention, second bridesmaid. The consolation draw, but still a nice prize! And it is Miss... Yvette Chevrier! Another round of applause. See what I said? She won't even be a bridesmaid. He can go back to his box. You think? Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Yvette, can I give you a kiss? Thank you. Thank you, Yvette. Thank you, everybody. And here we are! In this envelope I have the name you're all waiting for. The most beatiful, the name of... Nantes carnival queen...1960! Ladies and gentlemen, the name of your queen, the one who will reign in your beautiful city for a year. I call upon her majesty... from Brittany, for Duchess Anne, Mireille Legaloudec! Oh, my God! I knew it! Oh, Mireille! My little queen! Stand up, show yourself, my princess! Come on! Mimi! I knew it! Okay, thank you, sir. Mireille, come closer. She's from Brittany! Isn't she beautiful? There are islands in Brittany. Archipelagos! And without a doubt, from the farthest comes this majestic pearl. Let's welcome her, clap louder! Come on! Louder! Jean! What are you doing? You're leaving? Leave! And leave me alone! What about the float? Don't worry, I won't destroy it. It's the last one, a gift. Tell Legaloudec. Bravo! What are you doing? Can't you see? I'm packing. Can we talk about it? Go back to bed. The show's not worth it. I'm tired of all this, Jean. I wanted to speak you, Jean. I wanted to say... That he came here? Don't worry, I know. But it's good that he came. I'm relieved, I'm happy... I imagine. You'll be happier still. Everybody likes the dress. She was elected, your little protégé. The black queen, something different. I'm not fussed. I just got rid of the dress, understand? That, to understand? Stop, Jean, listen to me! I love you, Jean! You had to sleep with him to realize that? He didn't touch me. Yeah, you expect me to believe that? I swear! Don't take me for an idiot. After all this time, I can imagine your reunion. Don't say that. It's not funny I'm not trying to be funny. You don't want to understand what I'm saying. Oh, I understood. He didn't touch you. I still don't care. It's a bit late for that. I've waited like an idiot for 20 years. Four kids... we wonder how! Now I'm asking you, if you really believe what you said, then leave. Get out of here! Leave the house! But before you go, tell the kids. Tell them I understood! Go on! They're just there. I was going to! Sorry. Dad! I want dad! Nicolas, Bilou, go to sleep. What's going on? Where are you going? I'm leaving. Don't be stupid, Jean. Jean... Tell me where you're going! Jean? That's it. There she is! She's beautiful, isn't she? -That's my girl! -And I'm her granddad! Here! Look, the queen! Yeah! My darlings! That's enough, girls! Go to your places. Go on. Ah Yvon, this is going to be the best party ever. The first time I've received the queen's dad here. Can I participate? I knew I'd come across you today. You don't mind that it's at your place? It's all yours. We don't often get people of your type here. -Is that okay? -Of course, Jean, you know it, where and when you want. We've seen worse. It's all yours, boys! Girls, it's free! Go! Champagne for the winner, and my girls'll christen you! You have the honor, Jeannot. Oh, my God! I've been waiting to do that. You could have dragged it out a bit longer. Well then... I'm not in the mood. Don't be mad, Rita. That's not the issue. But we'd like to have your business. Celebrate for me. Is the boat in the port? Yes, it leaves tomorrow. Do you want to be a sailor as well? Dad! -Where were you? -You didn't jump in the river? No, can't you see? Your dad is unsinkable. Don't worry, I won't hurt him. Where were you? Is it true, dad? Everything's okay now. I'd like to talk to you, Mireille. Of course. Be nice now, leave us a moment. Mireille, I'm leaving. Why? Where are you going? It doesn't matter. I wanted to apologize. Please forgive me. Everything I said, it wasn't nice. I also saw you on my float. You did? Yes. And I don't regret making it. Although I know now that with or without, anyway, you're the best queen we could dream of. It's the dress too. The dress, the float... You deserve them all. Sincerely, I'm happy for Yvon too. Thank you. You should tell him. I already have. I have to leave now. Stay beautiful. And be happy. Dad, you can't leave! I'm not leaving, just moving. Don't let it bother you. Look after these two. And you two, give Pauline a hug. And don't annoy Lucien. Why don't we stop him? Because this evening he's like you, he's growing up. Let him go. It's noon. Are you okay? How do you feel? I'm the happiest man alive, good God. So, how's my queen? She's still sleeping. She's had her share of emotions. Not as much as me. Nothing better could happen to me. Your friend... My friend Jean has the best right hook I've seen. He left. Mireille didn't say where. Mireille said that? Yes, I think he's upset. That's normal. A great guy, right? Don't worry, I have an idea where he went. And now? Where should I look for him? And where's the boat going? The boat won't change. It's done the same trip for 20 years. Yvon left Trentemoult on it when it was new. So, Jean will do the same trip? I guess. Just wait for him to come back. There's no other way. He took everything. I don't have any money. We'll sort it out. I still have some savings. I've got enough for you to go and get him. Even if I wanted to go, it would be impossible. Annie's grown up, I'm here. With Mrs. Rousseau and Françoise, we'll manage. But over there, how will I find him? It's ridiculous! It's an island, it's not that big. A man like Jeannot, with all the bars, you'll find him. Are there any other boats leaving soon? One month isn't long. That's maybe the time he needs. And you. Mom. Granddad said where dad is, I'll get him soon. Really? Yes, really. I wanted to say... Well, I wanted to say a lot of things, but... I don't know where to start. I wanted to say I love dad and I love you four. Mom! Don't cry Annie. She's right, we have to stop crying for no reason. Look, you're nearly as big as me. You're a beautiful girl. Go and find a man. But just one at a time!
