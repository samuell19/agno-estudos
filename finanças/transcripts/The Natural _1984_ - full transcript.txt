You got a gift, Roy. But it's not enough. Rely on your gift alone and you're gonna fail. You gotta develop yourself. The secret is confidence and concentration. You got them, you don't need much else. WOMANâ€œ. Iris! Roy, just pick a spot and work at it. A clear mind and the ability to see with the heart. - That's real strength. - Iris! Iris! I gotta go. This is your spot, Roy. Pay attention to it. Roy. Roy. Roy! Roy, what is it? The Cubs have sent for me. - Oh, wouldn't your daddy be proud? - I gotta reach for the best that's in me. - Wait, it's just a tryout. I haven't made it. - You're gonna make it. - So when do you have to go? - Tomorrow. Oh, God. I've never been on a train before. It makes you feel important. - I want you to marry me. I do. - Oh! [Love you so much. I wanna send for you. It's all right. Max, this is Roy Hobbs. Roy, say hello to Max Mercy, the syndicated sportswriter. - I'm pleased to meet you. - And this here's the Whammer, son. - How do you do? - How you doing? You sure look different in street clothes. Thank you. It's always nice to meet a member of the general public. You boys heading to Chicago too? - That's right. - I've been invited to see the Cubs. I thought you might've heard of his eight no-hitters. He sure mowed them down last year in that Sabotac Valley league. Come on, Max, let's play some cards. Kid, keep up those no-hitters, or they'll be looking for you back at Soda Pop Valley. Sabotac. Whatever. Hang on to the water wagon, old-timer. - Hey, mister-- - Forget it, Roy. Forget it. What'll it be, slugger? Hearts. - You see this? - What's that, Max? An Olympic athlete was shot, and just one day after the slaying of a football star, Johnny Zirowski. In each case, a silver bullet was used. - A silver bullet? - Yeah. That's crazy. SAM. Something wrong, Roy? ROY. Maybe I'm not ready for the majors. Hey, hold it there, hold it there. You're not gonna let that big ape get under your skin, are you? - A year or two of semipro ball... - Semi nothing. You know what your father said to me once? He said, "One day that boy's gonna walk down the streets... ...and people are gonna say, 'There goes Roy Hobbs... ...the best there ever was in the game.' And the whole country's gonna be saying it before long." Next stop, Iola. Half-hour water stop in Iola. Watch your step there. Mind the time now. Half-hour only. Another home run! Okay, Whammer, thattaway to hit them, boy! Come on, Whammer. Hit another one, Whammer. Is he the best? Best there ever was. Best there is now and best there ever will be. All right, that's it, folks! Come on, Whammer! You got a good audience out here! - You wanna see some more? - Yeah! You'll have to come to Chicago and buy a ticket! Hey, your bat! Here, pal. You keep that bat, compliments of me. Nice job! Keep it up! There he goes, folks! The Whammer! The best baseball player in the country! Hey, busher! Pitch one in here. I'll knock it to the moon, huh? - Whammer. - Whammer! You sure can pick them, Simpson. I got $10 here says he strikes Wambold out on three pitch balls. You old boozer, your brain must be full of mush. This shit-kicker couldn't strike me out with 100 pitches. Three is all he'll need, Whammer. I love contests of skill. Do you, honey? So do I. What about you there, Huckleberry? Scared? Not of you, I'm not. We'll go on the other side of the railroad tracks, so nobody gets hurt. All right? There's gonna be three pitches. I'll call them, okay? Sixty feet 6 inches, exactly. Let's go. Batter up, come on. Keep your shirt on, Max. Batter up! Let's go! Play ball! - Help you down there? - Throw it here, plowboy! - It don't get no lighter. - Chuck it down his whammy. - Come on, boy. - Hold it! If he tries to dust me off, I'll crack his skull. You both got that? Burn it by him. Give him a shave with it! - Oh! Ah! - Strike one! - You okay, Sam? - It's all right, Roy. This damn glove. Max, how you gonna call them from way back there? - He looks wild to me. - Them your knees I hear shaking, Max? Mind your business, red-nose, and play ball! Throw it in here, greenhorn. All right, do it again, Roy. Come on, boy. - Strike two! - He must be throwing spitballs! In a pig's poop. That ball's as dry as your granddaddy's scalp. This one's it, Whammer. This is it. Here you go, I'll take that. Hold them. Come on, Roy. Right by him, baby. March him out. Yeah, there we go. Strike three. You're out. Hey, mister, you forgot this! Wait, mister! What's your name?! Roy Hobbs! Here! Thanks! Hello. I'm Harriet Bird. And the way everyone rallied around you! They'll be talking about today for years to come. It was just like watching Sir Lancelot jousting Sir Turquine. Or was it Maldamor? I'm not sure. Uh... - Have you ever read Homer? - Homer? Um... Well, only homer I know has four bases in it. Homer lived ages ago, and wrote about heroes and gods. Oh. And he would've had it in mind to write about baseball... ...had he seen you out there today. You know what? Someday... ...I'm gonna break every record in the book. I know I got it in me. And What will you hope to accomplish? When I walk down the street, people will look at me and say: "There goes Roy Hobbs, the best there ever was." Is that all? Heh-heh. Well, what else is there? Isn't there something more? - More? - More glorious? Do you have a girl? - I'm gonna say good night now. - Harriet. Would you come watch me play sometime? Oh, Roy, you are priceless. - Well, will you? - Of course. I could throw a ball in here and never hit the end of it. - That's for sure, kid. - How far is it to the stadium? We're going to the hotel first. - Hello. - Hello, Roy. - This is Harriet. - Excuse me? - Heh. Harriet Bird, silly. - Oh. Are you by yourself? Yes. - Where are you? - Come down to 602. Let me welcome you to the city. The door's open. Hello? How did you know I was staying at this hotel? What's going on here? Roy? Will you be the best there ever was in the game? That's right. All right, kid. Throw strikes now. Put something on it now! Look at this, Red. He's walking the whole ballpark, and he's the best pitcher we got. I should've been a farmer. Since the day I was born, I should have been a farmer. - -For Pittsburgh, number 38... ...Stu Jenkins. I love chickens and pigs and ducks. I'm kind of fond of nanny goats, I am. Oh, come on, Fowler! Throw strikes! - Fowler's killing worms, Pop. - Hey, Fowler! Don't you know how I hate losing to the Pirates? You know, Red, my ma urged me to get out of this game. When I was a kid, she pleaded with me. And I meant to. You know what I mean? But she died. Tough. Now look at me. I'm wet nurse to a last-place, dead-to-the-neck-up ball club... ...and I'm choking to death! Wouldn't you think that I could get a fresh drink of water... ...after all the years I spent in this game? Red, did you talk to that bastard partner of mine about the drinking fountain? Well, the Judge said he's working on it, Pop. Working on it? Son of a bitch. - All right, pick it up now! - Ball! You know, the day that snake walked into this ballpark... ...one of the darkest days of my life, Red. What do we got here, Red? The Salvation Army Band? - Pop Fisher? - Who wants to know? I'm Roy Hobbs, your new right fielder. - My what? - It's right here. - Scotty Carson sent you here? - That's right. He must be nuts. Where do they find these guys, Red? Fella, you don't start playing ball at your age. You retire. Where'd he find you? The Heeber Oilers. The Heeber Oilers? I never heard of them. They're semipro. Semipro. Schultz, go warm up. Did you ever play organized ball in your life? I just got back in the game. What does that mean? I used to play in high school. Excuse me? I used to play in high school. Red, he used to play in high school. Ha-ha. That's nice. Scotty Carson signs him up... ...the Judge okays the deal, they ain't talked to me yet. I got that in my deal for as long as I live. They gotta talk to me! - I got a contract. - I wanna see it. Aw, come on, Hinkle! Five hundred dollars they give this guy to play with us. This ain't legal. - Is Carson your chief scout? - Yeah, so what if he is? He said he had the authority to sign me. Yeah, well, he don't have. Let me talk to you just a minute. Now batting for Pittsburgh... He has, Pop. You said so yourself, if he ever found anybody decent. I know, Red, but look at this guy. We don't need no middle-aged rookies. Well, we sure need somebody. Hey, fella. All right, you come at a bad time. Like Red says... ...Scotty Carson seen something in you. Go find Doctor Dizzy and suit up. Red, I should've been a farmer. Number 11. That's a bad-luck number. I won't go into that. What about nine? Nine? Well, you got me. Nine it is. What's in the case? - My bat. - A bat? Follow me. Second locker down. Slip this on. See if you got enough room underneath the arms. - Thanks. - You're welcome. If it was close, why didn't you slide? I had a cigar in my back pocket. I didn't wanna break it. What's this rumor I hear about you and Memo getting hitched? I don't know where you heard that. She's been saying that to everybody. - Yeah? - It's not true. What's this? Another victim? Bump Bailey. - What are you? A new coach? - New player. Roy Hobbs. No kidding? I didn't catch your name. What was it? - Roy Hobbs. - Max Mercy. Oh, Fowler, I wanna ask you something. Hobbs. There'll be a room for you at the Ellicott Hotel. Why don't you meet me in the lobby about 6:30. We'll get something to eat, have a little talk. Fine. Another brilliant find from our scouting system. Geniuses. Here. Try this on for size. Welcome to the majors. We're not moving. - Hey, Pop. - Hi, honey. You together? No, I'm meeting Bump. Oh. That's my niece, Memo Paris. Roy Hobbs. He's a new player. How do you do? Hello. What position do you play? - He just started today. - Right field. Right? That's Bump's position. Isn't it, Pop? I tell you, Mr. Hobbs is brand-new... ...and we're not sure what we're gonna do with him. Come on, sweetie, I'll walk you to a cab. - Bye. - Bye. Anything wrong? No, just not used to hotels. Let's go. - How long were you with the Oilers? - Two weeks. Two weeks? And, uh, before that? Just knocked around from here to there. You don't mind me asking these questions, do you? I read Scotty's report on you. Said you're one hell of a hitter. How come you didn't start playing when you was a little younger? I did play when I was younger. We're already eating. We got our food already. We've already ordered. But you gave it up? Sort of. But my mind was always on the game. So I figured... ...to give it another try. Uh-huh. Just like that? Just like that. Where you from? Does it matter? You don't put out a hell of a lot of information, do you? Well, just what took you so long to get here? I got lost, I guess. Do you always talk this way about yourself? Do I know her? Let me tell you something about Pop. He gave his heart and soul to the game... ...only to get it trampled on. Pop thinks he's jinxed. I'd give my right arm to get him the pennant. Ha-ha. Go ahead. It's mostly Bump's fault. - How's that? - Well, he's lazy. I'd have traded him off a long time ago... ...but Pop seems to think a hitter like him could be a leader. Turn the ball club around like magic. Red, it took me 16 years to get here. You play me... ...and you'll get the best I got. I believe you. Pretty good food, huh? It's damn good. You can't spell it, but it eats pretty good, don't it? All right, come on. A little hustle, a little hustle! Pop, I don't know where they're piping that water in, but-- Never mind about the water. Stand up there and hit the ball, big guy. Hobbs. You wanna sit this one out? Can you imagine that Judge, Red, sending me a middle-aged rookie? I'm gonna pay his contract. I ain't gonna play him. Never. Well, Pop's in one hell of a fix. He had some financial problems last year... ...and he had to sell the Judge 10 percent of his shares. That made the Judge majority stockholder of the Knights. Well, the Judge has been doing everything he could think of... ...to make things rough on Pop. He's made all sorts of trades on us that only hurt the team. But Pop got one condition in his contract. If he can win the pennant this season... ...he can buy back the shares, and the Judge is out. And Winner take all. He figures I'm one of those trades? That's kind of a bad play there. --Relieve you of the fears and anxieties... ...which are so inherently symptomatic of a losing team. Sorry, doc, I had a little... You know. The mind is a strange thing, men. We must begin by asking it: "What is losing?" Losing is a disease... ...as contagious as polio. Losing is a disease... ...as contagious as syphilis. Losing is a disease... ...as contagious as bubonic plague... ...attacking one... ...but infecting all. Ah. But curable. Now, I want you to imagine... ...you are on a ship at sea... ...on a vast, calm ocean. Hobbs, you wanna sit back down there and pay attention? Gently rocking. Hobbs, get back in here! Gently rocking. Gently rocking. Gently rocking. Hobbs. I'm sending you down, Hobbs. Class B ball. Tomorrow morning you go to the Great Lakes Association. - Okay, you make the rules. - That's right. That's right. And you ain't been playing by them. All these other guys play by them. - Don't you remember signing a contract? - Yeah, I remember signing to play ball. Not to be put to sleep by some two-bit carnie hypnotist. I won't do that. You're going down. It took me a long time to get here, Pop. I won't do it! I can't. I came here to play ball. Hobbs, come back here! Batting practice tomorrow. Be there. I have been. Every day. - Yeah. - There it is. You all squared away? - Yeah. - All right. Get in the cage. Let's see what you can do. Get out of there, Bump. Show us what you can do. Bear down on him. Try this one, grandpa. Yeah. Hobbs! Roy! Come here! Let me see that bat. Not bad, kid. Where'd you get this? I made it myself from a tree near home. "Wonderboy." You put that on there? Yeah. What does it mean? I made it a long time ago when I was a kid. I wanted it to be a very special bat. How about this? This lightning bolt? The tree that I made it from was split open by lightning. I don't figure this. All those years and you never played organized baseball? Well, I sort of got sidetracked. Red, measure that and weigh it. If it comes up to specifications, we'll let you use it. Now, go on out there and shag some flies. Better late than never, Pop. Red, this is practice. We'll see. The Knights lead Philadelphia, 3-2. A golden opportunity to break... ...the longest losing streak in Knights' history. Fowler throws. Here's the swing. Long fly ball. Bivens moving under. Wait a minute, here comes Bailey! Bailey knocks the ball... - ...and the ball rolls to the wall! - You stink, Bailey! And now one run moving across the plate. That's gonna make it 3-3. And here he comes around third base. Bivens throws the ball to second base. NOW it's 4-3, the Phillies. A golden opportunity and it goes down the drain... res Bailey boggles the situation and knocks the ball... ...loose from Bivens' glove. The Knights can do nothing right, no matter what they try. You ain't nailed to the ground. Move, move. A little hustle! Let's go, let's go, let's go! Bumper, I wanna see you in my office after the game. Hey, I lost it in the sun. Blinding. First! To first base! Safe! All right, all right, all right! Stay put, Bumper. You're gonna sit this one out. - Hey, what are you trying to do, huh? - I'm taking you out of the game. - Sit down, will you? - You want an apology from me? Forget it, because I ain't gonna apologize. - Listen to me good, okay? - Yeah, I'm listening. I'm the manager, you're the player. You sit down there and keep your mouth shut! - What do you want from me? - I want you to sit down! Gabby, Boone, help this guy find his seat! Hobbs, you're up. What's the matter with you? Sit down and shut up, you mouthy prima donna. What do you want from me? An apology? Forget it! - Sit down and shut up! - Trade me and get it over with! Hey, Fisher, let me have a hitter up here. Come on, Hobbs! You're up! All right, Hobbs. Knock the cover off the ball. Now batting for Bump Bailey... ...number nine, Roy Hobbs. Here's a surprise. Pop Fisher's gonna replace Bump Bailey with number nine. Number nine is Roy Hobbs. Hobbs was brought up in midseason. I don't know too much about him. We'll try to find out something for you. Apparently, Fisher's very upset with Bump Bailey. Bailey messed up that play out in center field with Bivens. Two runs came in. That made it the Phillies 4-3... ...When the Knights had a nice 3-2 lead... ...and trying to get themselves out of this terrible losing streak. MacBride's gonna look in again at Hobbs right now. He's gonna check Bivens at first base. Baker leading off of second base. - And here comes the pitch. - Strike one! Fastball, inside corner, strike one. Hobbs didn't like the call. Welcome to the majors, Mr. Hobbs. MacBride gave him a good, strong fastball on the inside corner. Let me see the ball. - Not all that junk, the ball! - That junk is the ball. - That's a ball? - Jesus, he shot it to pieces! That's no ball! We want a real ball! Pop, was that for real, that cover coming off? - Well, you were there. You saw it. - Yeah, I know. Hey, Hobbs, how do you explain that cover coming off that ball? I hit it as hard as I could. Is it true he just walked in off the street one day? Can we see the bat Hobbs used? That's the way to grease them. Ain't no mystery. Pop, give us a break! Where'd you find him? The scouts found him. They're always looking for young players. Young? He doesn't look too young to me, Pop. Is he 35, 36? That's young to me. Come on, where in the hell did you find him? As my chief scout, Mr. Carson, I'm relying on your honor. I'm doing What you asked me to do. Hobbs is an absolute joke, a nobody from nowhere. Yes, that's just what concerns me, Mr. Carson. It's about time we found out just who he is and where he's from. Good day. â™ª And when I'm taking trips To her tasty lips â™ªâ™ª Nice bat. You like it? Yeah. Do you think I'll be able to make one of those bats? Tell you what. Why don't you go down to the lumberyard... ...pick yourself out a really good piece of wood... - ...and we'll work on it together. - All right. Thanks. - See you. - See you. Hey, Hobbs, Hobbs. I'm Max Mercy. I met you in the locker room with Bump. - Yeah. - Interesting way you mistreat a baseball. I Can I buy you a beer? - No, thanks, I'm in a hurry. - I wanna ask you something. - Do I look familiar to you? - You? No. Because you sure as hell look familiar to me. - Where you from, Hobbs? - Nowhere special. Wait a minute. You ever play in the Cardinal organization? No. Well, it'll come to me in a minute. I got a terrific memory. See you around, Hobbs. Okay, here we go. - Want me to do it? - It's your story. - Okay. Look out, step back. - Okay, here we go. All right. Jeez! There's something a lot stronger than wood in his bat... ...and that's my column. Hi, AI. - Hi, Iris. How was your weekend? - Oh, swell. What can I get you? One of those, cup of coffee. Okay. Help yourself. - Hey, AI, did you read Mercy's article? - Why should I read it? I heard it. Must've been the rain. Stitches probably got loose. Come on, it didn't start to rain till after he hit the ball. - The ball was defective. - "Defective." He made a meal out of it. - What's the name of his bat? - Wonderboy! "Wonderboy." Wonderboy... Ah, you guys. You know, people are always running down amazing things. This guy Hobbs, you ain't seen nothing yet. I got a feeling about him. Wonderboy. You gotta be kidding! See you later, AI. Okay, Ralph. Our cameras turn to the world of sports. In response to sportswriter Max Mercy's accusation... ...that Wonderboy was a loaded bat... ...Commissioner Gates made' this statement. We measured and weighed the bat... ...and it is within league specifications. Therefore, the bat is legal and may be used in league play. Hold up the bat! "Wonderboy"! And, oh, What a bat it is! I'm gonna level with you. My gut tells me, Red agrees with me. See, we figure Hobbs can replace you very neatly. So I'll tell you What. We're gonna give you one more chance to shape up. Otherwise, it's the bench. Starting today, you're gonna play your chops off. Okay, boys, who's got it? Lose something, Roy? Is this it? Wonderboy. I found it there in the laundry basket. Imagine that. I don't know how it got there. Nice bat. - You wanna give it here? - Sure. Give it here. All right, you guys. Let's go, let's 90. Let's get dressed. Can't take a joke? Hobbs, you gonna work out in street clothes today? No. Top of the seventh. Knights leading Boston, 6-3. Bump Bailey's having a terrific afternoon. He's 2 for 2 and made a great catch off the right-field wall. Bump Bailey at the top of his game. Looks like your little talk to Bump is paying off. I gotta believe you're right. Fowler has been strong today, very good control. Abel is taking a slight leadoff to second base... ...Fowler begins to try' to move him back. Fastball, swung on. Long fly ball out there! Bailey going way, way back for it! This ball is hit real deep. Bailey looks up! He hits off the wall! The ball rolls free. Bailey went through the wall, folks. He went through the wall. There's no movement out there. I think Bailey's hurt. He's certainly down. Bailey looks like he's seriously hurt. In a stirring ceremony at Knights Field... ...star right-fielder Bump Bailey's ashes... ...were dropped from a biplane as fans and ballplayers stood... ...and paid their last respects. Bump Bailey died after crashing... ...headfirst into the right-field wall in pursuit of a fly ball. A great catch that almost was. Rest in peace, Bump Bailey. Baseball Will miss you. Play ball! Over 27,000 fans here... ...as they pay their respects to Bump Bailey. Roy Hobbs stepping up to bat right now. Just the other day, Roy Hobbs knocked the cover off the ball. That's right, knocked the cover off the ball. So he certainly had an auspicious beginning. Hobbs hitting from the left side. Looking in right now, Hobbs in his stance. Here comes the pitch. He swings. Long fly ball! Way, way, way back! Way up into the rafters there! An unbelievable hit from Roy Hobbs! Incredible power! As good a hit as I've seen all year. Hobbs rounds the bases. Roy Hobbs, 2 for 2. Maybe we can expect some good things from Roy Hobbs. You'd never seen Hobbs before you came here? No, I already told you that. What do you got on your mind? Strange. Roy, you were really throwing that lumber around out there today. Yeah, we broke a few windows, didn't we? Real good. You know, there's not a mark on it. Not a nick. I boned it so it wouldn't chip. You know what I like? I like this lightning bolt. When I was a kid, my father gave me his collection of squadron insignias. The kind flying aces used to wear. It reminds me of that. - Good night, fellas. - Nice game, guys. Wait up. You wanna get something to eat? Sure. Hey, Olsen, nice patch. Try putting it over your eye. All right, I ain't talking, I'm hitting. Whoa! - Impressive. - It must be the patch. It's like Samson with his hair. He came alive. Well, he sure did. Seems to be a slight mistake. Olsen's hitting the ball. I want one of those for myself. â™ª And the rocket's red glare â™ª â™ª The bombs bursting in air â™ª â™ª Gave proof through the night â™ª â™ª That our flag was still there â™ª â™ª Oh, say does that star-Spangled â™ª â™ª Banner yet wave â™ª â™ª O'er the land of the free â™ª â™ª And the home of the brave? â™ªâ™ª --Hobbs' homer, goes into the 11th! Home runs, triples, singles... Anything he wants to hit, he hits. I've never seen anything like it. It's incredible! Anything he wants to do, he does! I mean, how can somebody play that well that came from nowhere? New York Knights' powerhouse hitter Roy Hobbs... ma shining example to his young fans.. Though embarrassed by praise and shy of the press... ...Hobbs is always there for an autograph. Well, I'm sure gonna try real hard. Hey, Roy, what's it take to be a big leaguer? Well, you have to have a lot of little boy in you... ...so I think all you guys qualify pretty well. - Oh, oh! What's your name? - Andrea. And with a few words of Wisdom that... ...who knows, might alter the destiny... ...of one of these fine young fans. "If I Had You." "Small Hotel." "Dear Old Girl." â™ª She speaks Of how I love you â™ª â™ª Old girl â™ªâ™ª I'd have bet money you wouldn't know that song! I'd have bet money you wouldn't know that song! Hey, Roy, pitch it in! Come on, let me see what you got! Let me see what you got! - Aw, come on, one more. Just one more. - Throw him one, Roy. Come on, Roy, I wanna knock it into the stands! Come on, Roy, pitch it in! Bet you 10 bucks he can whiff you, molasses. You already owe me $10. - Double or nothing, then. - You're on, sweet knees. Come on, pitch it in, Roy! One more, Roy! Right into the stands! Left field, Roy. Right into the stands. Okay, Roy, barrel one down his main street now! - He really burnt that in there. - See that? Hey, Roy? - Yeah? - Roy, you wanna come in here a minute? What's up? Ask the Judge. The Judge? Yeah, he wants to see you. Maybe I should go with you. No, I can handle it. I hope so. - Hi. - Hi. - I'm Roy Hobbs. - Yes, Mr. Hobbs. The Judge is expecting you. Go right in. Thank you. Mr. Hobbs. Come in. Come in. We meet at last. This is a swell office. Mere creature Comforts. Could use a little more light though. Where you from, Hobbs? All around, really. What about you? Please, uh... Please pardon the absence of light. You see, as a youngster I was frightened of the dark... ...and I used to wake up sobbing in it as if it was water... ...and I was drowning in it. But, as you will observe, I have... ...so thoroughly disciplined myself against that fear... ...that now I much prefer a dark room. The only thing I know about the dark is, you can't see in it. Mm. A pure canard. What's a canard? A prevarication. - What does that mean? - A lie. You can see, you know. Well, not good enough. You see me, don't you? Maybe I do, maybe I don't. I asked you here because I wanted to pay you my compliments... ...for your performance in the field. It's been fun. Oh, you've made a great contribution. Stands have been constantly filled. Financial fortunes have been radically reversed... ...since you joined the organization. I hadn't noticed. You're not fascinated by the almighty dollar? I never gave it much thought. Mm. You're above such mundane thoughts, huh? I didn't say that. No, I'm as interested in a buck as anybody else. And I am not one to let good deeds go unrewarded. - Would a new contract interest you? - Yeah. For more money. You wanna pay me more money, that's up to you. I don't detect any gratitude on your part, Mr. Hobbs. You know, I'm under no legal obligation to pay you one penny more. Either way, I play to win. A young man your age ought to be thinking about your future. Well, let me put it to you this way: There's no way I'm gonna let you steal this club from Pop. The fact is, Pop Fisher is a jinxed man. And not you, nor all the Roy Hobbses in the world are gonna change that. - Well, it'll be a team effort. - You're a very impudent man, Mr. Hobbs. The interview is ended. Ha! You come back here and turn off that infernal light! He's not as greedy as Bump. He'll be hard to work with, but we'll get him. How'd it go up there, kiddo? What are you doing here, Mercy? Why don't you stay home in bed and quit tailing me around? You really are a riddle, aren't you? What are you trying to hide anyway? - I ain't hiding a thing. - Well, who says you are? You know, old Sam Simpson died before he could give me the lowdown on you. But I want you to look at this. What you have in your hand there is a great story, but I want it all. A Max Mercy exclusive. I wouldn't want the public to get the wrong idea about you. There are a lot of stories floating around about you. One says that you used to play for another major-league team. One says you used to be an acrobat in the circus. There's even a crazy story that said you killed someone. Let them believe what they wanna believe. My paper will guarantee you 5 grand, cash, for your story. It'll give your fans something to keep up their goodwill in you. Okay? Once you get to know me better, you're gonna like me. Are you bored, doll? Come here. Do you know what you need? Hm? You need a place like this. - Somewhere out there, Gus. - Out there? No, not out there. Looker like you out there, you'll get into all kinds of trouble. I've seen it happen any number of times. What I need is protection. Twenty-four hours a day. Yeah. The world's lousy without money, isn't it, pal? - Yep. - Yep. In my business, the secret is knowing what's going to happen before it happens. Do you understand? Mm. You miss Bump, sugar? No. Do you? Well, I miss anybody who can be had. And it's yokels like Bump... ...that make all of this possible. I know. It's so peaceful here. You have any ideas? Well, I bought the most gorgeous pair of silk pajamas today. Would you like to see them? Yes, I would. Hi, kid. How you doing? How are you? Nice to see you. Now, we're gonna meet a guy named Gus Sands, all right? Who's he? You gotta be kidding. He's only a $10 million-a-year bookie. - You never heard of him? - Uh-uh. No. Awfully nice guy. Awfully nice. Like that? They don't have bands like that in Nebraska, do they? That's not where I'm from, but they don't have them there either. Gus? Gus? You know-- Here. You know Roy Hobbs. Oh, yeah, sure. I know all about Roy Hobbs. Everybody here know everybody? Sit down. Sit down. - Have a drink, slugger? - No, thanks. Strictly a Wheaties man, right? Well, the eyes. - Gotta keep them clear. - Ah, yes, yes. So how'd it go today, slugger? Well, he did better than we did. He got, what, 5 out of 5 in the first and 3 for 4 in the second. Oh, What do you know? That's gonna cost me a pretty penny. - Oh, how's that? - Well, I bet against you today. - You bet against the Knights? - No, no, no. Just against you, kid. I didn't know you could bet against just one player. Oh, you can bet against anybody, anything. Strikes, balls, hits, runs, errors. Anything, take your pick. I once bet $100,000 on three pitched balls. How'd you make out? Didn't. But the next week, I ruined the guy with a different deal. Ah, sometimes you win, sometimes you don't. I lost with you today... ...but some other time, I'll clean up double. How are you gonna do that? When you're not batting so good. Well, how will you know when to bet on that? The magic eye. It sees all. Gus, why don't you show him how it works? Go on. Ah? Yeah, sure. Why not? I'll bet that I can tell, within a buck either way... ...how much money you've got in your pocket right now. I'll take that chance. For a thousand dollars? Better make it a hundred. You know the Judge. A hundred it is. You got 10 bucks. - What is it? - Eight dollars. You lose. And the silver? The silver. A dollar, what, 37? Never misses. Right, sugar? Just a lucky guy, Gus. That's pretty good. I owe you 100. Ah, forget it. Forget it. Someday you'll maybe do me a favor, hm? Don't bet on it. Excuse me. What? I think you overlooked these, Gus. We call it even? Would you like to dance? What do you know about this guy, Max? Not much. Not very much. But I got a questionnaire out in a thousand papers all over the West. Somebody's gotta claim him, right? Right. - So are you interested? - Yeah, I could be, Max. Could be. I can't pay enough for good information these days. Thank you. It's nice to know my hair is full of silver. Can you read my mind too? No. I'm not good at that. You don't mind if I just look? Isn't that what you've been doing? So far. So far it's fun. Does it get better in private? I have a car. What about Gus? I'll tell him you made me disappear. My father walked out on us when I was a little girl. I don't really remember being happy till I was about 18 or 19. Then what happened? Then I won a beauty contest. How could you lose? You know, it's strange, I don't know what it is... ...but ever since the hotel, I feel like... I feel like we've met before. I doubt it. Anyway, they sent me off to Hollywood to become a starlet. I went to acting school... ...and I was good. No, I really was good. See, I could make myself-- Like in my thoughts, I could make myself into anybody I wanted to be. Like, almost like-- Like I had past lives. Well, after all that, I came east to visit Pop. Met Bump and decided to stay. It's too bad about Bump. Yeah, but you never knew what he was gonna do... ...on or off the field. So, what about you? So now it's your turn to tell. Me? I got nothing to tell. Come on. I have no secrets. Maybe. But I do. Maybe we all do. Better that way. Do you like being famous? Maybe. Ask me in five years. Yeah, but in five years, question will be, do you like being rich? - Well, that's a lot of maybes. - Ah... What about magic? Oh! Where'd you learn magic? Oh, I just picked it up around, through the years, like a lot of things. Like what? Baseball. "Baseball." Max was right. You're just a mystery. I mean, I don't know... Max. He's just after a story. What about Gus? He's quite a character. Well, Bump introduced us. He picked me up when I was down. He's a friend. He has a penthouse on Central Park West. You should see it. I'm not waiting for true love to come along, Roy. I never have. I've known a million guys. Bump was swell. He was real swell, but typical. You're not like him... ...or anyone else. Gus gives me things. Things I've never had in my life. Anything wrong with that? Not if you understand the risks. There are always risks. Touch me. Three-twelve, please. Thanks. See you later. - You know what time it is? - Yeah. I could fine you. And I would too, if you were making any money. Wait till next year. There might not be a next year for you, you keep pulling stunts like this. How long you been seeing her anyway? Since tonight. Well, I'd better tell you something. You're a full-grown man. What you do with your personal time is your own business. But I got it in the back of my mind, that girl's bad luck. - Well, you're a swell uncle. - Got nothing to do with it. I love her. But I believe that bad luck has a way of rubbing itself off on other people. Pop, don't worry about me. Well, I am. See, I'm just considering you. I'll consider me. Strike three! Where were you? Oh, I was with Gus. He thought something happened to me last night. It did. Strike three! - Are you all right? - Yeah, we'll get them next time. Haven't you been paying attention? Strike three! Hi. You miss me? Strike! What? Are you--? Are you all right? Oh, yeah. It's all right. Sorry, I... - It's all right. - I just... I just touched you right here. It's okay. What are you doing, calling that man out? Because he was out! Do you need eyeglasses? The team bus is now at the 34th Street entrance. Bus is at the 34th Street entrance. Let's go. - Straighten that good-looking tie. - Okay. Bye. - Hey. How you doing? - What? Well, okay. Iris. It's all yours, sir. I was just finishing up. Cub program! Get your Cubs program here! Ten cents. Get your official Cubs program here! Ten cents. Peanuts! Five cents. Now batting for New York, number nine, Roy Hobbs. Hobbs coming to bat right now. Hobbs has a terrible batting score. He just can't seem to get himself on track at all. Hobbs, trying to get something started. And here comes the pitch. Strike! Strike the burn out! Strike two! Lazy pitch there. Strike three! Hobbs goes down. Three pitches, three strikes. You're a burn! Maybe you ought to try another bat. Whatever's wrong isn't the bat. Sixth inning, Knights lead the Cubs 2-1. Fowler stepping up to bat right now. Short ball, a hit! That's gonna be out into right field. Hobbs is gonna dig it out. He 7! Fire the ball into third base. Down, down, down! Safe at third base! At the end of the sixth, it's all tied up, 3-3. Top of the ninth inning, Cubs leading by one run. Bivens at the plate. He swings. Fly ball. Hit to Camaretti, who's having problems with the sun. And he bobbles the ball! Bivens heads to second base. Here comes the throw! Bivens is gonna take it standing up. Safe! Now batting for New York, number 18... ...John Olsen. Safe! Now batting for New York, number nine, Roy Hobbs. Hobbs just can't get himself on track. He's 0 for 2 today. Stepping up right now, he gets the signal. Bivens is at third base, 3 to 3. Strike one! Pop Fisher's not happy. Here comes the pitch again. - Swings and... - Strike two! He just can't get himself set. He hasn't had the concentration. Sit down! - Hey, sit down! - Sit down! Folks, I'm telling you, I've seen some power before... ...but certainly Hobbs... - Over here! - Where you going? You ever hit one that far before? Hobbs, turn around, will you? What's he looking at? - One more. - Hobbs, over here. Hobbs. Come on. This is for you. Nice lady. Are you married? Hi, folks. What can I get you? AI. I'd like you to meet Roy Hobbs. - Are you kidding? - Hi, AI. What do you think I ran over here for? We got jiffy service? The pleasure's mine. He's a great fan of yours. - What can I get you? - You got any lemonade? Sure have. - I'd like the same too, please. - Two lemonades, coming up. No, not married. Are you? No. Hard to believe someone with your looks would be on the loose so long. Well... I don't get lonely. How is it the girls missed you? I didn't see any point in settling down. Two lemonades. Oh, boy. Ain't she a peach? I come here a lot. You go to many games? No. So why did you come? Maybe I shouldn't have. No, I'm glad you did. Well, I don't know. We're not kids anymore. Things are never the same. Am I different? Am I? Yeah. A lot. I thought I saw you once in a train station here. - Really? - Mm-hm. I used to look for you in crowds... ...thinking someday maybe you'd be there. Somewhere I stopped. What happened to you, Roy? My life didn't turn out the way I expected. Well... - What is it? - Well, I've gotta go. How come? I've just got to. I'd like you to come to the game tomorrow. I can't. I, uh-- I came today. I see. You work? Mm-hm. Come. - Hello. - Surprise! It's me, Memo. Hi. Where are you? I'm here in my room... ...sitting in a white slip, thinking of you. Hey, I miss you. I miss you too. Did you hear? We won today. Yeah, I did. I heard it on the radio. Congratulations. Thanks. But you better get some rest. You'll need it. - Good night. - Good night, Roy. And I love you too. Oh, that was cute. Smooth enough? You are in control, aren't you, pal? Sure, Gus. Sure. Hobbs at bat. He shattered the clock yesterday. Hobbs swings! That's gone! Bottom of the third inning. Hobbs looking in. He swings! There's no doubt about that one! Goodbye, Mr. Spalding! Nine to three. Bottom of the sixth. Hobbs sets himself. He swings! There it goes! Oh, my! Ninth inning. Hobbs has been a one-man wrecking crew today. Here's the pitch. He swings! I don't believe it! Four in a row! What a day for Hobbs! Oh... - Hi. - Hi. I just wanted to... I'm glad you came. Just think what I would've missed. That was just luck. I know better. Wait. Are you going? - No. - Can we... ...walk a bit? All right. I meta woman on a train to Chicago... ...and it was a mistake. - Do you mean when you first left? - Yeah. And I guess that was the beginning of a lot of mistakes... I was in the hospital for a couple of years. Finally I got out, and they told me I couldn't play ball. I didn't have any money, and jobs were hard to come by. I lost my confidence. Then there was just no going back. Were you in Chicago the whole time? No, I was sent to Baltimore. I was there the longest. And how long have you been in Chicago? Well, I guess now it's about 10 years. - Would you like coffee? - No, thank you. I don't have time. - You sure? - No. I don't wanna put you out. It's not putting me out at all. I'll just brew it up. - Nice cup of coffee? - No, that's all right. Just something simple, if you have iced tea? Iced tea. I don't have any, but I'll brew some. - Oh, you have to brew some? - Yeah. - Then I'll have some coffee, okay? - Okay. This is a swell apartment. Thanks. Ah. Did you sell the farm? No. I'll always have that. Good. It's home. It's my son's. He means the world to me. He's a great kid. I'll bet he is. I'd like to meet him. He's coming home pretty soon. Is he with his father? No. His father lives in New York. Oh, you're... But I've been thinking that he needs his father now. He's at that age. I think he needs him. Sure. A father makes all the difference. Yeah. You gotta catch your train. - I can stay. - No, I think you'd better go. Yeah. Okay. Where to next? Uh... Boston. I'm sorry I missed your boy. I'll tell him. Roy Hobbs. He won't believe it. That's good! Do a goose step now! I'm trying to shelter this guy. Have a peanut, Bobby. No, it's too late. He's gonna be too old. Did you do your homework? - All right! - Here goes nothing. Blew a little too hard there. Hobbs is making the whole situation impossible to predict. Forget what you're thinking. Everything is falling into place. I'm telling you, we're leaving too much to chance. I know what I see. Hobbs will make it more interesting, he won't make the difference. - There were two brothers? - No, three. Who's the guy in the white shorts? Mr. Hobbs! Telephone call for you. You can take it in the booth. Where? - Catch you upstairs, Roy. - Yeah. Hey, mister, I think your call's in this booth. Hi. Hi. I was on my way back from the Cape. - You know, it's lonely. - Mm. Was it this crowded in Chicago? - Hm? - Heh. I hadn't thought about it till now. Well, think hard. Safe! Safe! He dropped the ball! Here's the pitch. Hobbs swings! Long fly ball! That's right! Goodbye, Mr. Spalding! The Knights have tied for the finish! They've tied for the finish! You can hear this crowd! They're going crazy! They got Hobbs... Don't waste it. Don't waste it. Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Knock it off! Hey, knock it off! We gotta win another game before this is over. Don't jinx this. Look at this. Now, come on. Go home, get some sleep. Knock off the booze. No booze! I'm sorry, but there's no answer. - Would you place your call again later? - Okay, thanks. The Knights simply have to Win... ...one of their final three games against the Phillies... - ...to put them in the World Series. - Mercy. That's gonna wrap it up here for this post-game show. I'll be right over to pick him up. Protect your car with Valvoline Motor Oil! This is Jim Bauer inviting you to join us tomorrow... Boy, did I miss you. What's going on here? A victory party. We haven't won yet. Whose place is this? Mine. At least it will be in a week. You must've hocked your fur coat for it. Never. Gus chipped in. Oh. How do you like it? I like it. I'm not so sure anymore... ...after Chicago. Come on, Memo, how about a dance? Sure, AI. Don't wait up, grandpa. Welcome home, slugger. - Some blowout, huh? - Yeah. All fresh food from Jack and Charlie's. So how's the team holding up? They can do no wrong. When you're on a roll, it's like that sometimes. And when you're not, every little thing gets you down. What about you? What about me? I see you dug yourself out of that hole you were in. It must have cost you a couple bucks. Heh-heh. You're up, you're down. How's the Judge treating you? - What's it to you? - Nothing. Except it's a crying shame that son of a bitch is paying... ...a good player like you rock-bottom salary. - I can live with it. - You gotta look to the future. You can't build on what you don't got. It's really nice to know a guy like you worries so much about a guy like me. Please, please. Listen, I'm just bringing it up... ...because I know that Memo's crazy about you. I mean, I wouldn't like to see you lose her to a better provider. Fame isn't enough, kid. I'll take my chances. Why should you, when we can all profit from these little chats? I mean, take tomorrow, for example. Tomorrow I wouldn't bet against me. You're missing the point, kid. I already have. Yeah. You can't hang on to the game forever, kid. You can't get back into it from jail either. Ah, isn't she something? - Yeah, she is. - Yeah. What every guy would give to be in your shoes, huh? You're standing awful close, Gus. I can't tell whether it's your toes I'm feeling or mine. I misjudged your boy. I don't like being disappointed. Mm-hm. - Try some of these Ã©clairs. - I was gonna go on this little-- Nah, nah, nah. The whipped cream's a little... Nah, no, no. I don't like it. It's not good for my stomach. Try one of these. Here. Try this. Thank you. â™ª Remember when we get there, baby â™ª â™ª Two-steps we're gonna have 'em all â™ª â™ª We're gonna dance off Both of our shoes â™ª â™ª When they play Those "Jelly Roll Blues" â™ª â™ª Tonight-- Tomorrow night â™ª I don't know what I'm doing... ...but I'm having a great time, take it, everybody! â™ª I'll be down to get you in a taxi, honey â™ª â™ª You better be ready About half past 8 â™ª â™ª Come on, baby, don't be late â™ª â™ª I want to be there When the band starts playing â™ª â™ª Remember when we get there, honey 5â€œ â™ª Two-steps we're gonna have 'em all â™ªâ™ª You okay? Roy, you okay? You okay? Where's Pop? "Where's Pop?" What are you, nuts? Sit down. Ow. Hey, guys... ...I think you better get me out of here. - Come on, let's go. - Call a cab. Come on, come on. And how are we feeling today? Okay. Where am I? Tower Maternity, Roy. I'm Dr. Newman. It was an emergency, and we were the closest. - But-- - They, uh-- They lost three in a row. What's done is done. Am I okay to play Monday? I'm afraid there's some bad news. The lining of your stomach has been gradually deteriorating... ...due to a previous injury. We pumped your stomach and came up with this. This silver bullet head has been in your stomach for some time. Years, I would say. It doesn't matter. It's history. Yes, but it could prove fatal if you continue to play baseball. Stop now, and in time it could heal properly. Can I play Monday? The odds and your age would be against you. One day, your stomach could easily just blow apart, kill you on the spot. I'm sorry. Roy Hobbs, New York Knights star, remains laid up... ...at Tower Maternity Hospital in New York City. The full nature and extent of his illness is as yet undisclosed. His availability for Monday's National League playoff game... ...remains a question mark. Turning to local news... May I come in? You must've had a snoot full. It was a great party. I.... I heard Gus and Max talking last night. What about? He said that if you played Monday, it could kill you. - It's a lie. - No, it's not. I mean, you're not gonna play. Really, are you? It would just be my last game. Oh. It's his last game! Well, that's rich. What are you trying to do? You're trying to kill yourself, aren't you? Doc's making it out worse than it is. Oh, he is? Oh, sure he is! Hey, why not? Hey, I look swell in black. Don't you think I look swell in black? I sure do. Why don't we just get away? Let's just go away right now. I've been away long enough. Oh, my God. Why are you doing this? What for? Just to play in one last game, is that it? It's all I've got left. Then I can walk away. Well, I have a small favor to ask. Walk away right now... ...and you'll live for sure. And that way we can see a whole lot more of each other. And you won't walk away empty-handed. That's for sure. What do you mean? I mean, Gus will stake us to a lot of money. We can buy into a company. Everybody does that. Think what we can do, Roy. With your name, we'll make out fine. If I skip the playoff? Come on, Roy, you understand. You make up your mind to have certain things. You know how it is. Yes, I do. Do you? Just a few practice swings, that's all. Just to get back my timing. It's my ass if Pop finds out. We heard about that. We heard about it already. Just make sure you take it easy. Roy's the money. And if he gets hurt, we're both out of a job! We know to take it easy. Just making a point. Take it easy. I don't know. Sometimes I wonder what I'm doing in this game. How do I get myself in situations like this anyway? Diz, I think maybe we heard that a couple of times. Cab and hospital and the clubhouse, he's saying that. - He's making me nuts. - Yeah. All right, here we go. Come on, Diz. You get that, Max?! Give me a ball. Don't ever look back, Max! Ever! Roy. Diz! Oh, my God! - Can you stand? Roy, can you stand? - Yeah, yeah. - We should've had more sense! - It's all right, Diz. No one will know. No one's gonna know. Take it easy. We better get you back to the hospital. Who's there? Don't be alarmed. I understand that you are playing. - I wouldn't want you to dock my pay. - Oh, on the contrary. I wish to augment it with a bonus. Now, as you may know, we are favored to win. Which puts you back on the bench, working night court. Oh, I have decided that would be a grave mistake. Now, financially speaking, I can do better by not winning. With your help, of course. You put that in writing for Pop. Now, as you may know... ...the prevailing rate for this sort of thing is $10,000. I'm offering you twice that. You're wasting your time. You know as well as I do that you're in no condition to play. Then why the 20,000? Insurance. You could get into the game. You could wreck it with an unexpected blow. That'd be the beauty of it. It's a monumental mistake, Hobbs... ...in light of certain information that I now possess. Police photographs... ...taken, oh, 15 years ago... ...in a hotel room. By the way... ...that's you. A nice young boy. Half-naked lady... ...lying in the street. You, in her room, shot. Nasty business. Mercy. Of course, full disclosure of this scandal in the eyes... ...of your admirers and loved ones... ...could only cause humiliation. Embarrassment. It was suicide. Oh, Mr. Hobbs... ...if kids should see this... Now, it's a surprisingly simple procedure. You're to play your normal game except when you are at bat. And then, under no circumstances, are you to hit the ball safely. They'll beat you without me. Without you, they lost three in a row. Now, what is more, I have a contingency plan for their flat failure. Who else is in on this? A key man. Good night, Mr. Hobbs. Here's another. Listen. "To Roy. We love to watch you hit that ball. We cheer when you're connecting. But it really shocked us, one and all, to hear that you're expecting." Hold it. I didn't write those lines. I didn't think you could read, Diz. Gentlemen, the babies. Please. What about the babies? How'd you like to wake up to this every morning, huh? I can't have this noise. You're disturbing all the mothers. I guess that's you, guys. Take care. Get well quick. You just go out there and play great ball, you guys. Take care. Get well. We need you. Take care. Look out on the way out. Just keep your eyes straight ahead. It's gonna be tough without you, Roy. Thanks, Diz. Miss! Miss. Hi, I'm Max Mercy, sports columnist for The Daily Mirror. I saw your picture in the paper. Very nice. Roy and I go, uh, back a long way. I wonder if you could help on this. See, I need a little help, if you could give me some. Uh, for Roy's defense, okay? Now, you know this woman? You know what happened? Anything to do with, like, a love quarrel? You might have known her, she knew you, a love triangle... ...or something like that? Heh-heh. A bad joke. Heh-heh. But maybe, I thought you might be able to help us with some little clue. You know, I'm gonna do everything I can to keep this story from breaking. Hey, miss? - Hi. - Hello. Is there... ...a chair? Doc says I have to quit baseball. Why? Some mistakes I guess we never stop paying for. I didn't even know her. The girl on the train? You liked her, didn't you? Yes. But I didn't see it coming. How could you possibly know she'd hurt you? How could anyone? - I didn't see it coming. - You think you should've? Yes. But I didn't. Why didn't I? You were so young. Things sure turned out different. In what way? Different. For 16 years, I've lived with the idea that I could be-- Could've been the best in the game. You're so good now! I could've been better. I could've broke every record in the book. And then? "And then?" And then when I walked down the street, people would've said: "There goes Roy Hobbs, the best there ever was in this game." You know, I believe we have two lives. How? What do you mean? The life we learn with and the life we live with after that. With or without the records... ...they'll remember you. Think of all those young boys you've influenced. There are so many of them. That day in Chicago, why did you stand up? I didn't want to see you fail. I wish Dad could've... God, I love baseball. Are you gonna go to the game tomorrow? Yup. Is your son with you? He is. He, uh... Excuse me. Well, I gotta go. You got a gift, Roy. But it's not enough. A clear mind and the ability to see' from the heart. That's the real strength. Just pick a spot and work at it. The secret is confidence and concentration. Confidence, concentration. All right, that's good. You got them, you don't need much else. Tomorrow, after we've lost... ...I want Pop Fisher out of here, bag and baggage. That's right. Lay it all on the line, Harry. All of it. That's right. You heard me. I'll call back. Hey, slugger, you okay? I'm fine. - You look a little lost. - I'm not. You dropped this on your way out. Something seems amiss. Correct me if I'm wrong, Hobbs, but we had a deal. No. Those are your winnings, slugger. This is a gag, Hobbs. Pick it up. Get out of here. If it isn't enough money, tell us What you've got in mind. To hit away. I thought I could rely on your honor, Hobbs. You're about to. You're a foolish, foolish man. You've forgotten something. - Your past. - I don't care. Go on. Get on the phone. No. That won't be necessary. I like the action. Then let it ride. You bastard! I hate you. I hate you. You were right, Memo. We have met before. You know, you're a lot weaker than I thought. What do you think this changes? Why don't you have Max draw you a picture? You can read about it in the morning paper. You're yesterday's news, kid. You had a great gm, 3 takerâ€œ. But â€œNS not enough. I think you're a loser. You can't let him go. Roy... Relax. With his insides, he's as good to us now as he was before. Besides, we're $20,000 richer. Red, I wanted to win that pennant... ...worse than I wanted any goddamned thing in my life. And you'd think I could just this once, wouldn't you? I didn't care nothing about the Series. Win or lose, I'd have been satisfied. I'd have walked away from baseball and I'd have bought a farm. Nothing like a farm. Nothing like being around animals, fixing things. There's nothing like being in the field by yourself with the vegetables... ...and the corn and the winter wheat. The greenest stuff you ever saw. You know, my mother told me I ought to be a farmer. My dad wanted me to be a baseball player. Well, you're better than anyone I ever had. And you're the best goddamn hitter I ever saw. Suit up. This is your announcer, Jim Bauer. Oh, what a game we have for you tonight. The Pittsburgh Pirates versus The New York Knights... ...in a playoff game to decide the National League pennant. The fans are pouring in to Knights Field... ...which will be bursting at the seams. Who would've imagined midway through the season... .--that Pop Fisher's perennial also-fans would be facing.-- Hey. - Still dogging me, huh, Max? - Yeah. End of the road, Hobbs. You wanna hear what I think our chances are? You read my mind. Heh-heh. That takes all of three seconds. They come and they go, Hobbs. They come and they go. I'm gonna tell you something. I'll be around here a lot longer than you or anybody else here. I'm here to protect this game. Whose game? I do it by making or breaking the likes of you. Did you ever play ball, Max? No, never have. But I make it a little more fun to watch, you see. And after today, whether you're a goat or a hero... ...you're gonna make me a great story. Okay? See you around. Here come the New York Knights on the field. Of course, everyone will have their eyes on Roy Hobbs... ...whose recent illness came so close... ...to shattering the Knights' dream of a pennant. Hobbs moving out to his position in right field. And just listen to the sound of that crowd go wild for Hobbs! Unbelievable! Go, Hobbs! Let's go, Knights! He looks like he's set and ready to go. This is for the National League pennant! The Knights versus Pittsburgh! The playoff game! Play ball! AI Fowler on the mound. Two cuts as he faces Schaffer. Here comes the pitch. Schaffer swings! Fly ball hit out into right field. Hobbs moving back. The Pirates go down one-two-three in the top half of the first. - Feel okay? - Yeah. Bivens looking in right now against Youngberry. Youngberry, excellent control. Eighteen and nine on the season. The pitch! Strike three, inside corner! Now batting, number 18, John Olsen. - Come on, Roy! - Come on, Roy! And strike one on Olsen. - Strike! - Strike two! Hobbs kneels next to young Bobby Savoy, the batboy for the Knights. - Strike three! - Strike three! Olsen badly foo/ed! Now batting, number nine, Roy Hobbs! Come on, Roy! And listen to that chant! The Roy Hobbs chant! Hobbs stepping to the plate. Roy! Roy! Roy! Hobbs against Youngberry. Youngberry faced him twice this year. Here's the pitch! Swung on and missed! Hobbs fooled by that pitch. As 1 was about to say, against Youngberry... ...Hobbs has been 3 for 6 so far this season. Youngberry looking in for the sign. He goes to the wind-up. The pitch! Inside corner, strike two! And that crowd was not happy with the pitch. An excellent call. Youngberry looks in once again. Hobbs sets himself. The concentration! Youngberry to the wind-up. The pitch! - Strike three! - Strike three! Hobbs is out of there. And so at the end of one inning, no score at all. The big question is whether or not Hobbs can get his timing back. After a four-day layoff, sometimes it's difficult for a hitter... ...to suddenly just be able to step into the game. Hobbs came directly from the hospital to the field. He had absolutely no batting practice this afternoon. And so at the end of three innings, no score at all. Fowler looking in against Boyle. Boyle, the count, three and one. - The pitch! And he walks. - Ball four! You need glasses, ump! Fowler's had excellent control up until this point. Terrific so far this afternoon. Here comes Collins. Collins' last time up grounded out to first base. Fowler looking in. Boyle over on first base. Collins has good power. Fowler to the Wind-up. The pitch. Collins swings! Fly ball! Back, back! Hobbs drifting back. That's out of here! Home run for Collins! So that quickly, the score is now 2-0... ...as Pittsburgh strikes first. Fowler, up to this point, has been absolutely outstanding. That one got away from him. Fowler not happy with it at all. You got time! Come on! You can feel the anxiety spreading. Hey! Time! Wait a minute, this is a little unusual. Roy Hobbs has called time-out and is heading in to see Fowler. It's kind of an unusual situation. Play ball! Don't do it. If this is for show, you can cut the crap, big shot. Hey, come on, what is this, a picnic?! Give them the real stuff, AI. I'll start pitching when you start hitting. What the hell's going on out here? - It's a surprise. - It's okay, Pop. Let's play ball. Two to nothing, and the Knights coming to bat. - This is it, Roy! - Swing it, Hobbs! Now batting, number nine, Roy Hobbs! Come on, Roy! Youngberry, the pitch! A swing and a miss. Hobbs misses. Swing and a miss! Strike two! Come on, Roy! Strike three! And Hobbs falls to the ground! Hobbs tried to meet that ball and totally missed it. Knocked to the ground. Picks himself up again. Youngberry overpowering. Hobbs just hasn't been able to put it together this evening. - Where are you going? - I'll be right back. Excuse me. It's all right, slugger! Come on, Hobbs! It's very important that Roy Hobbs gets this. I'm sorry, I just can't do it, lady. I know. But you must understand, I have his son in the stands. He doesn't know his son is here. - I just can't do it. - Please, I don't know what to say. At the end of six, no score at all for the Knights. Fowler! Long fly ball! Back to the wall! He has it! So at the end of six innings, again, 2-0. The Knights still on the short end' of the stick. Ball! Strike! Strike! Ball. Frenchie going for two! Here comes the throw! And Frenchie is out of there! He never should have gone for two... ...but I guess he's trying to get something started. And so at the end of seven, 2-0, Pittsburgh. Fowler's been overpowering ever since the 4th inning. Getting himself set on the mound. Fowler looking in against Jenkins. The pitch! Throw, swing and a miss! Strike three! And so at the top half of the ninth, still 2-0. Two outs right now. Bivens going back to get himself another bat. Nothing has worked so far. Maybe he'll try another one. Bivens 0 for 2 today. The pitch! He swings! There's a shot over the right field! Collins picks it up-He's throwing it! There's the throw! And he is safe! - Safe! - Unbelievable! Oh, my! Two outs! Now batting, number 18, John Olsen. Okay, hit her now. I'm telling you, What a game we have tonight! From the stretch, Youngberry looks... The pitch! Olsen swings! Ground ball to third! He bobbles! He throws over to first base! Run, you son of a bitch! Run! Safe! The ball rolls free! Bivens takes third! Now batting, number nine, Roy Hobbs. Roy! Roy! Roy! Come on, Roy! The pitch! - Ball! - Ball! Outside corner! Hobbs, the determination! Hobbs has been an outstanding player all year! Trying to get his team into the World Series for Pop Fisher. Youngberry! The pitch again! Inside, ball two! Time! Calls time-out. Heads for the mound. Could be it for Youngberry. Taking no chances at all. There he goes. He's gonna go for a left-hander. Youngberry not happy at all about this. Youngberry has only given up three hits in the entire game. A beautiful pitching performance. Let's go! Young John Rhoades strides' to the mound. A Nebraska farm boy, blazing left-handed speed. This Pirate organization expects great things for him. You can hit it! You can hit it! They say he's got the best fastball in the major leagues right now. This is the game for the World Series. One of these teams will be, tomorrow, playing in the World Series. It comes down to this. And Roy Hobbs is the man of the hour. John Rhoades checks the man at first. Checks the man at third. Hobbs, with determination, trying to make it happen. The pitch! He swings! Oh, my God! He shattered the glass to the press box right next to us! Absolutely broke the glass right next to our radio booth here! Hobbs, incredible power! The pitch! Strike! You can do it! This is it! This is the game right now. Hobbs is at bat still. He brought them this far. Will he take them all the way? The pitch! Hobbs swings! Fly ball! Fading, fading, it's a foul ball! Let's go! - Go pick me out a winner, Bobby. - Okay. Come on, Roy! Roy! Roy! Roy! This crowd is going absolutely crazy here. If the Knights can get into the World Series... Roy. Are you all right, fella? Let's play ball. Hobbs setting himself. Rhoades looking in, first and third. You can do it! You can do it! Out of here, Roy! Out of here! Come on, Roy! Come on, big Roy, one time! Attaboy, Roy! And it's spinning way, way back up, into the right field! That ball is still going! It's way back, high up in the air! He did it! Hobbs did it!
