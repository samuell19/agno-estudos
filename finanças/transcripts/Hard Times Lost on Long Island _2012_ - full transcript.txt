I could think of a lot worse things that could happen to someone than being unemployed. I have a lot of things that happened to me in my life that helped me put this unemployment into perspective. I was struck by lightning when I was 15. I had heart trouble when I was 21. Reporter: There's been an explosion deep below... I was at the world trade center. I just started a new job when it was bombed the first time, and a few months after that, I was on the long island railroad when Colin Ferguson shot all those people on the railroad. And most recently, I was in the world trade center when it collapsed. So you know, you put all this stuff into perspective, being unemployed is something that I can deal with very easily, and it's-- you know, could be a lot worse. It's not the end of the world. * why does the sun * go on shining? * why does the sea rush to shore? * two days ago, it was a year I'm out of work. Everybody says the same thing-- "I'll get back to you. I'll get back to you." And they never get back. There's no jobs. If there is a job, there's 70 people that they're talking to. No, he said, "well, thanks very much for coming. You know, you impressed everybody. They were really-- they liked what you had to say." And then the big "h" word. Yeah, "however." No, I don't know what I'm gonna do. I don't know. I don't have anything right now to fall back on. No, I came from that networking meeting this morning. Nobody's gotten jobs. Everybody's the same thing. Boy: Want any lemonade? 50 cents. Oh, good idea. Very entrepreneurial. * I wake up in the morning * * and I wonder * why everything's the same * * as it was * I can't understand * no, I can't understand * * how life goes on * the way it does. I was on the phone with another company. - They called me this morning. - Linda Davis: Good. Fromm: So things are picking up, but picking up isn't good unless there's an offer, but... - I'm sure you're getting daily alerts. - Mm-hmm. - From hot jobs. - Yeah. Indeed. - LinkedIn. - You get any responses? Fromm: Yeah, "thank you very much for your note. - You'll hear from us." - And that's it? Waitress: Because of the economy, people come in and just want a cup of coffee. We don't bother them. They hook up and try to help each other with jobs and stuff. I was there when I was 15 years old and you booted me out. Let's connect 'cause I still know quite a few people. Waitress: I see them look at the newspaper, looking for a job, asking me if I know anyone. You know, you see it all day long. Fromm: I got turned down from fedex to drive a fedex truck to help deliver holiday packages. They told me I was overqualified. I just want to drive a truck. When does it stop? So you're overqualified. You're 50. So what do you do with these people that want to pay their bills? They don't want to foreclose on their house. Because they're 49 and overqualified, we still have to eat. - We still have children. So what do you do with us? - Mm-hmm. Steve kubic: We're in levittown, New York. It used to be an old war community. The boys used to come home from war and these houses were made cheap for them. Kevin gleason: When my dad came home from world war ii, he paid about $7,000 for the house. Kubic: Back then, it was a lot cheaper to live here. Jim garthwaite: I was born and raised in levittown. My father was a veteran in world war ii who bought one of the original homes in levittown. Howard garthwaite: 1947-- there was no place else to go. I was living in a furnished room, but I saw a house, and I went to a bank to get a mortgage on it and they told me I wasn't making enough money. But levitt, who was renting for the first year-- and then you could either rent or buy. * oh, we ain't got a barrel of money... * when you moved into a levitt house, you got everything you needed. You got a refrigerator. You got the stove. You got a washing machine. And this was the 530th house to be built. My father always did what it took to make ends meet. I never wanted for anything. I had a great home. I had a nice warm place to sleep. We had television. We had a car. It was a fantastic place to grow up-- in levittown. I've been here in the same house for 63 years. Over the years, people added on. They made changes to the house. What started out as an $8,000 house is now a $318,000 house. And that's down from the $400,000 it was worth a couple years ago. Jim: The economy changed, and I know when people are struggling. I recognize the unemployment checks, and I recognize the certified letters from the banks. I live paycheck to paycheck. I don't even know if I can make my next mortgage payment. Kevin: I worked here for many, many years and always made money to provide for my family, and now I just can't do it no more. There's no jobs. Chris foley: This is the seventh month anniversary of my getting fired. You know who's really evil are human resources, though. They're like double agents. There was this woman Ashley in h.R. I'm dancing with her at our Christmas party, and she knows I'm getting fired. It was like... , and I'm going... And she's like, "you're such a good dancer." And I'm like, "I know." Meanwhile, she's going, "you're so fucked." Newscaster: A big day of gains for the markets. Newscaster #2: ...Out of the recession. You're starting to see growth. Newscaster #3: The economy's looking much stronger. Newscaster #4: The economy has recovered. Newscaster #5: The system in place right now is creating lazy American. Newscaster #6: The moocher class out there. Newscaster #7: When people start to look, they start getting jobs. Go out and get a job! Work at McDonald's. Work two jobs. Man: Good luck. Thank you. James d'ambrosio: Ever since the crash, we're in a period of what I call, "prolonged economic uncertainty." The game has changed. Instead of getting 20 or 30 years at a company, hopefully, you can get two or three. Ryan einis: It's been weird times. Weird going to college and having expectations and assuming that things would go one way, and then the next thing you know, you're looking for a job at whole foods. Ralph Morrison: The middle class is not in the middle anymore. I think it's more of a lower class now. I mean, when I first started, if you had a job making $30,000-- I'm now 20-some odd years later, applying for jobs that are paying $30,000 now. Randolph leidl: When I read the paper and I read articles about the recession being over and things are getting better and there's job growth and whatnot, I just don't believe it. It's laughable. I've always been self-sustaining, self-sufficient financially, and now we're just in a situation where we've been looking for a real job for a couple years now already. Leidl: We're kind of at our wits' ends and we have the three children to take care of. I've always made a good income. - $100,000 is a lot of money. It is a lot of money. - It is. But a third of it goes toward your taxes-- federal, state, city, whatnot. So you're left with $65,000. Food has gotta cost you, I know, with us, right, what is it? $800 a month, probably, to feed everybody breakfast, lunch and dinner. So that's another $10,000. You got your mortgage and everything else. You know what I mean? So you're chipping away, you know? I can't fathom that people can survive in this environment. I'm just calling to find out if any new decisions have been made or how we're gonna go forward. If you can give me a call, please, I would appreciate it. It's 4:00 on Tuesday. Thanks much. Bye. Dang. I never imagined that I would be in a position, being out of work for a year and think that we could lose the house. We moved here for a reason. Long island's been very good to us and the kids, and we have friends out here. I love it out here. * this magic moment... Fromm: Grew up in Brooklyn. Born and raised in Brooklyn. I went to Brooklyn college. I met Susan at Brooklyn college. We lived there for five years before moving out to long island. Long island is a great place to raise a family. The highways are right near us, to ride to the beach, Jones beach, tobay beach. We joined the pool. The more time we spent out here, the more we liked it. That's why the prospect of losing this house is very upsetting, and I'll do what I have to do. My last job was at a company called l.R.N., which was a leader in the field of compliance and ethics training. You never really think it's going to happen to you. They would call people into the office and, you know, they would come out in tears. Everybody thinks their job is important, so I felt that, like a lot of other people, "my job is safe." I was able to work from home. I didn't spend much time in the office, so when you're asked to come into the city, and you're watching your colleagues getting laid off left and right... You know, I guess the writing was on the wall. I was laid off. And, okay, you know, "tell me what my benefits are and everything else." I mean, what am I gonna do? I'm not gonna let them know that they really upset me, but on the trip home, you know, it hit me. "I'm unemployed." I know how you feel when people tell you that. People that aren't unemployed and people that aren't going through this. "Yeah, I know how you feel." "No, you don't know how I feel. You're not out of work for a year. You're not trying to support-- you're working. You have a job. You don't know how I feel." - Fromm: You think like you're the only one. - Woman: Totally. Fromm: I was talking to one of my neighbors, and they're pretty much in the same boat. You live next door to someone for so long, you don't even know it and then all of a sudden, you start talking about it. "You, too?" Heather harstein: Exactly. For a couple months, - haven't paid the mortgage. - Right. Struggling to decide to pay it or to not because if you don't pay it for a couple of months, then you go into the foreclosure. And then you have to pay more money. Then you have to pay more. We are at the end of the modification process. The second time. For the second time. - Did you say we're at the end of it? - We're at the end of it. - So we think. - Fromm: So you hope. Anne Strauss: Two years ago I lost my job, so we put our house on the market. It's our only asset. It's all we've got. But our property taxes are very high, - and we have no money to retire on. - Woman: Right. - So we just have to work forever... But we can't get jobs, - so it's kind of a vicious circle. - Woman: Right, yes. Very difficult to figure out, - but we all did what we're supposed to do. - Right. And this has been the result for us. Strauss: I remember the day I lost my job as if it were yesterday. It was June, 2008. The h.R. Manager came into my office. I followed him into a conference room. The two of them sat down and I said, "let's just get this over with." Being unemployed for two years is not just a financial loss. It's an emotional loss. It's loss of friendships. People disappear. You can't socialize. It changes your-- every facet of your life. I'm panic-stricken. I'm feeling as if I have absolutely nothing. I don't wanna be helped. I wanna just help myself, but what we want are jobs. What we need are jobs. In my next job, and I will have a next job, I will thank god every morning and every night for that job. Newscaster: The phrase that job seekers are seeing more and more often now-- "the unemployed need not apply." Only employed people need apply, if you can believe this. Man: Is that legal? Woman: These folks have created giant holes for themselves financially and emotionally. Man: It affects their mental health. It affects their views of themselves and their self-worth. Newscaster: So could you possibly end up with a whole class of permanently unemployed people? Nick puccio: I've been on LinkedIn for two years. I've been on 20, 30 interviews. I must have applied for thousands of jobs over-- I mean, you know-- nothing. Different fields-- home depot, you know, back to wall street. I started on wall street. I'm a wall street guy, not one of the high-end, top percenters. I was a regular guy that got hired off the street. I started out as a messenger. I was a sophomore in high school. * 'cause I'm sitting on top of the world... * Nick: Back then, you got hired off the street, get you a job. They needed people. There were girls everywhere, and I said to myself, "I'm not gonna fall for the first one," and I met Regina right away, and it was like, "she's too damn good." She's the one that I'd end up marrying. * I'm sitting on top of the world... * Regina: I remember being so happy without a care in the world. Worked my way up to vice president in 2000. You know, I was making a decent salary. I made it to the hundred grand club, man. I was there. I was on the move. But in 2008, that's when it all hit the fan. Newscaster: The worst financial crisis in decades today. Newscaster #2: This is just absolutely stunning that lehman brothers and merrill lynch would actually fall on the same day. Nick: I went to work that morning. I spoke to the guy above me. "What's going on with the layoffs?" And he looked at me, and he was just real pale. And I was like, "you gotta be kidding. It's me?" It was just doom. It was just doom and gloom, you know, and I couldn't do a thing about it. I said goodbye to everybody, you know, I was pretty emotional. I knew everybody. I'd get on the elevator, I knew everybody. Regina's first words were like, "wow, you're home early." I said, "yeah, I'm home for today and tomorrow." Within, like, five minutes, I was like, "it can't be." You know, "it just can't be." Like, "how could this happen?" Not ever knowing what I was gonna be in for, not ever in a million years. Heather: I saw it, baby. Come on. Oh, man. Dave, you know she's gonna run right in, right? Oh, my god! - David: One more, whoa! - Wow! Heather: The idea that we had spent so much money on schooling and we were so highly educated and we certainly did not expect to have financial difficulties. That is true. Dave-- doctor. Me-- teacher. You know, all this education. Please. Of course, we're gonna be fine. Where are you, baby girl? We both had jobs. We got a mortgage in this tiny little house that we had purchased. We could pay for the mortgage. I lost my job. I had three years of great teaching. You can write about anything. There's no limitations here. Anything you want. Use the words, make up a silly sentence. I got called into the office, and I sat down. You know, we were like this. She said, "I'm sure you'll do a good job somewhere else." I looked her right in the eye. I said, "thank you very much." And I walked out of the office, and I was just in utter disbelief. In utter disbelief. We knew then that we were in trouble. David: I'm a chiropractor. I have noticed a big decrease in business over the last two years, probably about 25%. Our financial situation is pretty dire at the moment. We've recently filed for bankruptcy. Heather: Not a day passes where we don't, in some way, discuss our finances. David: Yeah, think about it. Talk about it. It's constant. It's constant. Heather: We've been together 16 years, and I would say for about 13 years, we were kind of like that couple where everything was just kind of, sort of picture-perfect. David: We both grew up on long island. - We lived a fairy-tale life... - Heather: Fairy tale. ...from the very beginning. I mean literally. Right down to the white picket fence. David: We went to college-- both: Suny geneseo. And we met up there. - Met right away. - Yeah, freshman year. My freshman year, - and we've been together since. - Yeah, long time. 16 years. First people married out of college. - David: Yeah. - Immediately went to our graduate degrees. - We were all, you know... - David: Wanted to live out here. Came out here immediately. Hi. - Hi. - Mommy! Heather: We made it through about 13 years. David: Yeah, it just worked. Heather: And then you know, our struggle came later. * I love you even more * than I did before * but, darling, what can I do? * Newscaster: There are a whole lot of people in this country that are unemployed, and if ever there was a need to extend unemployment insurance, it is now. Newscaster #2: The senate is expected to vote to extend unemployment benefits, but that is little comfort to the long-term unemployed who have passed the maximum time to receive benefits. Where are the jobs? Where are the jobs? Where are the jobs? Strauss: Unemployment doesn't seem to have a face on it. It's hard to organize people who don't have the means of physically getting together - in a place. - 99ers. Help us now! People are literally killing themselves because they can't feed themselves and their family. Help us now! Newscaster: If you've been out of work for two years or more, if you're a 99er, there's no hope in sight right now. - Coffee? - Woman: Yes. Strauss: Because we're looking at the last month of our unemployment benefits, we're terrified, and if it stops at 99 weeks, we just have no other resources. Man: Who can live off even the maximum? $430 a week? Winston Roberts: When I told my daughter, I said I lost my job, she went into an hysterical crying. "What are we gonna do? Where are we gonna live? What's gonna happen?" I worked as a systems manager. Most of those jobs went to India. I was involved with a lot of the training. It's scary, working and training someone and knowing that you're actually training someone to take your job. Mel Strauss: I've been told it's one of two things. One is it's age discrimination, which officially doesn't exist, but all of us know it's out there in force and that really annoys me. Or they tell me I'm overqualified. I don't know why I went to college, at this point. I don't know why I spent nights getting a graduate degree. I should have become a plumber. Paula sargent: I'm doing all I can to even network and it's still not working in my favor. You would think that your family and friends would be proactive in helping you get there, but it's like you're on your own, - and that's very disheartening for me... - Alan: Yeah. Because I have to go to bed every night thinking about that. Mel: You know, people say, "be tough, be strong," but how do we get up every day and face the abyss? It sounds weird, but there's good in every bad. And there's good that comes out of cancer if you survive it. Anne: Mel had lung cancer in 1999. In 2000, that lung cancer metastasized to his brain. He experienced horrific surgeries, radiation, chemotherapy. There's such support when there's physical illness, but when you've got this scary, no money, going-down-the-tube situation, people, I think, are more afraid-- "this could happen to me." Having cancer was easier than being unemployed. Anne: I grew up in a completely artificial world, but I had no idea. It was the '60s. I graduated from high school in 1970. * and your shoes get so hot... * when I was a teenager, we had a cabana at point lookout, and during the summer, we would go there all the time and have barbecues. It was carefree. There were no worries. * on a blanket with my baby * * is where I'll be... I went to college, probably because I wasn't engaged, frankly, but I'm very glad I did go to college. I was a bit of a rebel. The little hippie type, marching in anti-Vietnam rallies. I like a good rally. I really do. * under the boardwalk, boardwalk. * Mel: We met on the long island rail road. You become a creature of habit, and when you're on the rail road, you tend to go to the same car, the same section. I used to sit with four other people in this five-seater. One guy and I would always trade jokes. So one day we're sitting there telling jokes and there's this very pretty girl across the aisle, obviously trying not to laugh. Probably a year or two after that, we got married. * boardwalk. And that's how it all started. We were a product of the long island rail road. Fromm: For a couple of days, I had severe headaches that wouldn't go away. I had muscle aches. My neck was stiff, and I decided to go see my doctor, but the checkup showed nothing and, quite honestly, he attributed all the symptoms to stress and anxiety, possible depression. Maybe it was finally catching up to me. It's been 14 months. I recently gave blood. I give platelets every other week, and they test the blood before they give to anybody, and it tested positive for west nile virus. At least I knew I had something and I wasn't crazy. You know, I'll keep plugging away, keep looking for the jobs and making the phone calls, doing what I'm doing. Anne: Right now I'm pretty nervous. I've got my rosary beads and my St. Anthony medal. St. Anthony finds things, like jobs. Hello, this is Anne. Woman: Hi, Anne. I'd love to hear more about you-- what you're doing now, what you've been doing, what you want to do. Anne: I was involved with media relations. P.r. And I left there because they had a management change. A new director of marketing came in and brought his own team in. So since that time, in the last two years, I've been working 20 hours a week. How do you feel about diving into a situation, you know, 60-hours-a-week job, BlackBerry on the weekends? That kind of thing. Are you prepared to dive into that kind of environment? I'll be quite frank and say that's really what it is here. Anne: Yes. I wouldn't expect it to be any less. Well, I had an interview. I had a follow-up. It wasn't offered. I thought I was offered the job. I kind of assumed that I would get it. Coming home and saying, you know, "I didn't get the job, once again." That's tough. That's the blow. Newscaster: The problem with unemployment benefits is they encourage people not to take jobs. Newscaster #2: You're taking money from employers and you're giving them, by definition, unproductive people. Newscaster #3: Doing nothing but collecting a check. Rush limbaugh: The longer you pay people not to work, the longer they're not gonna try to work. Fromm: I'm not sitting home and doing nothing. A day does not go by that I am not looking for work. I had a series of six or seven different interviews with the same company, different people. "We're gonna make a decision within the next week, and you'll hear from us next week." A week goes by and two weeks go by, then all of a sudden, the company disappears from the face of the earth. The first plane had already hit, and I was the fire warden for the building, so I took the firemen with me and we went into the building, checked floor by floor. We got back down, and I turned to go out, and it was at that time that just the force of the building coming down basically pushed me out of the doors. I ended up under an ambulance and the rubble just piled around the ambulance. Right before I lost consciousness, I remember thinking that my son's bar mitzvah was coming up. I had to make it to his bar mitzvah. I wasn't gonna let him do this on his own. When I finally did come home, I remember pulling up in the driveway and my son heard the alarm on the car when I locked it. And he just stood there at the front door, "well, it's about time you got home." Nick: I've gotten a couple of notices in the mail telling me I'm a year behind. You're now 620-some odd days, whatever. But I'm hoping to hold onto it for the kids. My boys love the house. You know, I'd be more than happy to move down to the basement and give them upstairs to be a part of their life. If I had the funds, I would have sent them to a private school, somewhere where they had a good basketball program or a good athletic program. He could play any sport, but basketball, he'd be a stud. When the kids were small, it was great. You'd have a catch. You could throw the football. You know, if I was here when they were younger, I would have had a batting cage over here. I would have put the net over. A little younger and things worked out right, this place would have been unbelievable, but it would hurt. It would just hurt 'cause it's mine. My piece of land, you know? When they give me that foreclosure notice, I got, I guess, from what I understand, 18 months or so. When I see something certified or whatever, then I know. Then I know. It could be any day. Sgt. David sheehan: Do you know why we're here? It's to complete a warrant to remove. Your house was foreclosed on. We have a moving truck, and about 10 guys to come and move everything to the curb. Man #2: We are definitely seeing an increase in the evictions. We're busier now than we have ever been in the 23 years-plus I've been here. That tells you something about the economy. When we're that busy, it's never good. Jose Suarez: The people in the middle class didn't have to worry about having their goods put out on the street. I always kind of felt you had a certain level of protection to fall back on. Wolf: How do you recover from this? Machine: You've reached Wells Fargo home mortgage. If you will, leave a message with your name, loan number and phone number. Thanks. Have a great day and thank you for choosing Wells Fargo home mortgage. Hi, Laura. This is David hartstein. I'm calling to check on the status of my loan modification. So if you could please give me a call back, I'd really appreciate it. Thank you. David: In the fall, we went for the modification - on our own. - And we just had way too much debt. - They said no. - No. Actually, they said no the day he was born. Oh, that was fun. Did you say hi to Logan, shay-shay larue? Yes! - He's touching you, LAN. - He's licking me. He loves you. He's trying to give you kisses. We got home on a Friday night, and on Monday afternoon, I got the call. We got a call in the morning that he tested positive for downs. - And that we needed to come in. - We needed to come in. It was the most stressful time, as you can imagine, of our lives, - yeah. - Which has created all this magic and beauty for which we are very grateful, but... That's when we decided to file for bankruptcy. And that was when we decided. We were like, "we're done with all this." Richard Jacoby: So you did the chapter 7. All your unsecured debt is eliminated. - Yes. - And you're delinquent on this mortgage? - Heather: Yes. - How far back? - Heather: Four months. - Three, four months. You just weren't able to make the payments? Heather: We can't make the payments. We're also in the middle of a modification. It probably has helped you that you're now delinquent, because if one is current, it's unlikely that they're going to modify. - Heather: Right. - It does not help that there's equity in the property. Of course, the bank is fully protected, and if they were to foreclose, they would be made whole, and when it's time to go, you go. Fromm: We're behind now four, five months on the house. Truthfully, you know, it's embarrassing. There have been times when I questioned whether it's me. What am I doing wrong? It's the same things over and over again. You get close. You think you find a good opportunity and then it disappears. The more trouble, the more I turn to the religion and turn to god for, you know, for comfort. I mean, I'm here. It's time to talk to god and find out. You know, here I am. Can you help me? David: Things between Heather and I became really difficult. The financial hardship that we were experiencing. Heather: It was killing him. - He would get major, major rage. - I would pop. - David: I didn't know how to... - Handle emotion. ...deal and handle and feel emotions. Heather: That created a huge detachment from each other. A complete removal of affection on my part. - David: Right. - Like a deadness. Heather: We discussed him leaving. I was pretty serious and I think you didn't really believe me, and then, "you threatening me? You threatening me? This is my house." And then, you know, the lawn mower gets thrown. And then there's gasoline all over the floor, and the kids are there, and i'm-- everything is a mess and a wreck and I just said, "you are hurting me. I'm in pain." It seems on the outside, with everybody looking in, like because we've got the cute house and the cute kids and we do have a great relationship, it seems like everything's so easy, but we know we work really hard. - Yeah. - At not letting all the stress that has been our life for years - to drown us, you know? - Yeah. Anne: My husband has moved up to Albany and is living with my son and his family, and he's working probably at least 12 hours a day as a mortgage broker. It's something I never imagined we would need to do, in my wildest dreams. Mel: I'm 65 and I'm not going to be running around for another 30 or 40 years. This is not right. If there was one thing I could do tonight, all it would be would be to sit at home with my dogs on my lap and Anne pounding away on her computer. That's all I need. That's my American dream. What politician is gonna work for me on that one? I don't have much more time. I don't want to die on route 78 going to saratoga Springs. Nick: I have a bulging disc in my neck. My hands are numb-- and anxiety, depression. Anxiety, I guess. I'm on medication for that, too. I can't go without insurance, especially now. It's just not right. Like, I've been working since I'm 15, straight through all the years. I never used those benefits. Like, I worked hard for those benefits. Now I'm 50 years old and I can't get them. You know, I'm broke. I'm freakin' poor. I'm bankrupt. I'm done. You know, I'm in the lower half. I don't make any money. Regina: Food should not be an issue. That's like going into a supermarket and fearing that I don't have enough money. How am I gonna feed my kids next week? How am I gonna feed my kids this week? How am I supposed to do this? So I've been selling jewelry to get some extra food money and pay some bills with that, but, um... I did ask them... About my engagement ring. They told me that approximately maybe $2,000. They would really have to look up to see what I would get, but my husband was completely shattered when he-- he said, "I hope it doesn't come to that 'cause I worked very hard to get you that ring and it was such sentimental value." Regina: I'll take the milk. I'll take something like this. I don't keep it a secret anymore because it just is what it is. And if it's a matter of getting a couple of cans of corn or whatever to supplement, so what? It just gives me more money to be able to pay my electric bill. This is for Thanksgiving and here's your Turkey. We'll get from people remarks like, "what did you do with all your money? What did you do with all your money, you know, that you should have to use a pantry?" It's tough. It's tough walking in there. 'Cause that's kind of a big reminder of where you're at. That is the reminder of where you're at. Fromm: Yesterday I came home from a support group where people said to me, "oh, you're always smiling. You're always happy. That's why we love coming here. We love spending time with you." And I got home, and I actually said to Susan, "you know what? I don't think I've ever felt this depressed." There are days where I just feel like, you know, it's not even worth getting up in the morning. I actually took out the life insurance policies to see how the family would be taken care of if I were no longer here. My daughter had written me a note when she knew I was in one of my deep funks. And she said, "dad, you're the best at what you do. You're good people. We don't know why bad things happen to good people." She says, "but just remember, what doesn't kill you will always make you stronger." And... When I get-- sorry. When I get into my moods, I take that piece of paper out, and I read it, and it turns everything around for me. * just imagine a life with us together * * just imagine... * all of our dreams coming true * * just imagine... Anne: With the holidays coming up, it's just-- - Uh... - I hope the kids aren't expecting lots of gifts. When they were younger, hanukkah would come, they'd get a gift every night. Right, right. We're gonna take it. We're gonna re-wrap it and give it to them again. Nick: You see the roof on the house? That's your gift this year. That's my gift, yeah. Regina: Everybody goes through hard times. - You know, but why so long? - Fromm: Yeah. Regina: Like two years. There's gotta be some damage. - You've disappeared. You've fallen into a hole. - Mm-hmm. There's nothing left. Quit spending money we don't have. The question still remains-- where are the jobs? Politician: Government does not create jobs. Save whatever actually works. Investment in education. Politician #2: Many schools have been forced to lay off teachers. They're the first to go. These are real human beings who are out here struggling. Politician #3: We need to pay attention to these people who have at times had to choose between baby food and diapers and heating fuel. "We only eat two meals a day to conserve. I have no oil for hot water. We boil our water on the stove and pour it into the tub. I am making $10 an hour. I don't go to church many sundays because the gasoline is too expensive to drive there." The house was put into foreclosure. We didn't tell anybody yet. Heather: It's like, you look around, we don't seem like people who just went bankrupt, who are in foreclosure. David: I don't want people to pity us. You know, the feelings of failure. Heather: I definitely feel anxious a lot. Regina: I take the holy water and I bless the house with it. They say that it cleanses the evil away. I pray for strength. I just ask god to please don't leave us. You know, please don't abandon us. Nick: Basically, this is the first step in the foreclosure process. I guess it's gonna take a little time. I guess I got a year, 18 months. If I'm lucky, more. If not, we'll find a place to live. So time to go. Find a place to stay. Maybe I'll go back to queens, if they'll go for it. We're not in a cardboard box yet. Not just yet. I don't think it'll never be the same. The American dream is gone. Heather: I'd like to welcome everyone to Dave's funeral and celebration. Heather: Dave's death has opened the hearts of many people in our community. 'Cause they know we're in these dire straits financially. I mean, we had the dream. The dream was lived. The dream ended. * I've got dreams * dreams * to remember * many, many dreams * hard dreams and bad dreams * * to remember * I dreamed one day * I wanted to be with you * * but you were so far away * * an airplane couldn't reach you * * that's why I got dreams * dreams to remember... You know the interview, the first one was towards the end of December. I interviewed again a week ago Tuesday, and the offer was made to me yesterday, and I accepted. * dreams * to remember * dreams, yeah * to remember * good dreams, bad dreams, sweet dreams * * yeah, I got to remember * * long dreams, tall dreams * * oh, lord, I got to remember * * I been tired all night * * sleep in the morning, girl * * yeah, help me to remember * * sweet, sweet dreams * sweet dreams, yeah, girl * * I got to remember * take me away * take me away, take me away * * I'm gonna wanna remember * * take me all the way * take me home...
