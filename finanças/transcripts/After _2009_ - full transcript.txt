When the magic is gone, feeling nostalgic about that first time... - For example? - For example... When was the last time we saw each other? A year ago, - more or less. - At least. Has anything important happened to you since? In the last six months. I don't know. Why? How about a year from now? You mean my life is boring? No, I mean the rhythm is different. We've already experienced everything forthe first time. So what's wrong with nostalgia? Nothing is ever as good as the first time. - What the hell is this? - Here. - It's yours? - Give it here. - You can't go barefoot through life. - Give it here. You can't. Thank you. Hold on, I got it. Let me. I've got it. Let me. I've got it. What do you want? Are you trying to feel me up? Say something, he never quits. It makes him happy. I'm going to the bathroom. - Can I come? - Lf you dare. How's your boyfriend? Ask him when he gets here. You wanted to meet him. I'm gonna fuck hertonight. If I haven't by sunrise, breakfast is on me. You're kidding, right? I'm sorry, your credit card doesn't work. It doesn't? I used it earlier. Try it again, please. We already tried twice. Well, let me try. THE BODY SNATCHERS Ula, where are you going? Ula! Ula! Ula, come! Wanna hear some music? The storybook CD? Nothing. Don't you worry about Ula. She'll come back.

Daddy, don't leave me! Not in the water! Take it easy, Jimmy. What's wrong? School isn't such a bad place. It's not his school, it's my daughter-in-law. He's convinced she isn't his mother. She isn't! Keep her away from me! Nobody will force you, Jimmy. Pablo shouldn't see this movie. He should be in bed. What? He should be in bed? I made dinner. Pablo, come on. Pablo. He's asleep. I'll take him to bed later. This morning I made Ula's sign. I didn't make it to the pound. I'll go tomorrow. I'll get some wine. - Need anything from the kitchen? - No. Manuel? Are you okay? Yeah, keep eating. I'll be right in. What happened? Nothing. I dropped the bottle. Let me see your hand. Is that blood or wine? - I don't know. - You didn't feel the cut? Pablo! Honey, you're tickling me. Can't you say it out loud? No, it's a secret. You're shooting Mommy? It only kills Martians. - Finish your dinner. - It's ugly. - You're ugly. - No, you are. - Mommy's ugly? - Mommy's pretty. Come on, Pablo. Just this tiny piece. Pablo, please. Eat it. Pablo, keep your food in your mouth. It's not funny. Pablo! Pablo, chew your food. - I'm taking out the trash. - Okay. Chew... Pablo, don't be a pig! Get dressed. - What for? - Let's play pool. Where can you play pool at midnight? In a bar. Sure, in one of the thousands of bars around here. That's why we have two cars parked outside. - You don't love me? - Of course I do. Right. You love me but you won't play pool with me. I love you, but it's late. We both have to work in the morning. - What? - You wanna fight? What are you doing? - Watch my tits. - No fighting after midnight. Get your knee off me. Defend yourself. Defend yourself... Stop it, you're hurting me. Enough already, Manuel. Sorry. Are you okay? Come to bed. I'm coming. Manuel. Hi. Where's Mommy? She went to the grocery store. This is for you. You don't want to see it? You like it? Had your snack yet? I'll fix you one. Pablo? Pablo! Pablo! Pablo. What are you doing down there? Didrt you hear me? I've been calling you. Your snack is ready. Why did you leave the puppy alone? Come on out of there. Go away. Pablo, please, come out. Get out of my room. Come out of there. Go away. You're not my father. Pablo, that's enough. Let go. Let go! Come out, okay? Let's go. That's enough nonsense. Come on, sit down. Sit down, okay? What's wrong with you? Why are you looking at me like that? Answer me! Speak. That's enough of the little gun. It's time for your snack, you hear me? Wait, wait, wait. Pablo, I'm sorry. Where are you two brats? You can come out now! Come on, that's enough. No, stay down. He'll never see us. - That's enough! - He's going to be mad. It's ajoke. He plays them too. Sure. What? Are you scared of me? Am I scared of #you#? Then go with the flow. This isn't funny, you hear me? - Come on. - Grow up a little. Come on. PLEASE LEARN HOW TO THINK Manuel. - Cheers. - Cheers. Anyone need cigarettes? Get me two packs of Marlboro. Here. - Another drink? - One more and I'm going home. It's been a year and you're going home? It's late. For what? Sunrise isn't until 7. - Cut it out. - What? Stop poking me with your elbow. That's the third time. What elbow? Make some fucking room. - Make room yourself. - What? - Make room for your nuts... - What's going on? - This jerk... - Watch it. Watch what, asshole? You're nothing. Calm down, Manuel. And step out of the way. We're here to have fun, right? Yes or no? You're wasting that cute smile of yours. What's wrong? Manuel here wants to dance. Look after him for me. - Come on. - I don't dance. - Why not? - I just don't. You took something. Let me see... Manuel, say something to him. - "Say something to him. " Give up. - I give up. - Say, "Yes, sir. " - "Yes, sir. I give up. " Fuck. Let's go. - Not that one, it's Pablo's. - It's the only one. - Look harder. - I already did. - No, you didn't. - No. Well, there's a Dyango CD. I can't snort coke on Dyango's face. - Why not? - It's too creepy. He reminds me of my dad. I feel him looking up at me. Jesus Christ, Ana. You're an old fart. I can't believe you like Dyango. I don't, it's my wife's. She calls you sweetie pie. No, she doesn't. - Yes, she does. - Be careful. - Don't drop it. - Then slow down. I can't, I'm going 30. Julio, the coke...! You're like kids. No wonder, it's like Toys-R-Us in here. Wanna line? Check my nose. Just a pebble. Hey, what about me? Take it easy. Don't you worry, sweetie pie. Ana, pass me the bump. - What bump? - The coke. You had it. It was on the CD case. - You're shitting me. - You dropped it? Look for it. Relax and drive. Pablo doesn't crawl anymore, right? It's coke, not a samurai sword. Shit, Julio. - Look down there. - It's right here. You are such a dickhead. Shit, Ana. Get your feet off the roof. - They're clean, look. - Yeah, I can see that. - Here. - Hold the wheel. Which apartment is it? I don't know. Don't look, I'm gonna pee. Who is it?. Mom, open up. I lost my keys. - Jose Luis, are you drunk? - No. Yes, ma'am. He took drugs, too! I can't hear you, son. Jose Luis? Jose Luis! Knock it off! I can't hear you. I don't understand. Open up! Damn, this stings. What is it? Patriotic spirit. Stings, huh? - Yeah. - What is it? - M. - I'm gonna pee. Hey, stop killing yourself and leave some for the rest of us. One more shot and I'm going home. Want me to kill you? I'd rather pull the trigger myself. A little swim? What, you think they'd arrest us for this? Come on. - Keep it down. - What? - Don't make so much noise. - Why not? Come on. Do you say no to everything? No. You look like you're retired. Sitting on the shore at the beach. Scared of the waves or can't you swim? I have arthritis. Give me the gun. Help! Be quiet. Someone will hear us. Who? There's nobody around. It's a hotel. Swimming at night is prohibited. - Is it? - Yes. Suicidal and dumb. Wanna fuck? Right now? I don't think so. What about you? Me neither. Should we go back? I love you. I love you too. You're my best friend. What? What am I, your second best friend? You too. Me too what? You're my best friend too. I love you. I love you too. Give each other a peck. Just a peck. I love you.

Answer honestly and as quickly as possible. Go ahead. You're at home watching TV and notice a scorpion crawling up your leg. What do you do? I don't understand. It's your sors birthday, you're in a hurry to get home. You're driving and you see a dying animal in the road. Why is it dying? It got run over. Is it my car orthe company's? That's irrelevant. You get out of the car. It needs your help, but you get back in your car and leave. Listen, I sell industrial insulation and chemicals. Why not ask me about that? Flipping through a magazine at home, you see a photo of a naked man. Are you asking if I'm gay or a good salesman? Your wife has hung the photo in your bedroom. Forget this nonsense and check the sales figures. We all know you're here to fire someone. You think we're idiots? Tell me a joke. Ajoke? - Ajoke. Tell me a joke. - Well... I'm not very good at telling jokes. You're prettier in person than in photos. Don't be silly. I'm the same. I mean it. You didn't see the waiter staring at you? No. - You didn't? - No. No? No. Better. I love the things you say in chat. They're so romantic. You're very special. And sensitive. So are you. Don't touch me. Don't move. Stick your finger in my ass. Don't move. Another... another... Hold still, don't move. Right there... Right there... Wait... Wait, please. Don't put them on yet. Turn around. You can come on me if you want. I don't mind. Can I take the little bottles? What little bottles? Of shampoo and gel. They replace them every day, right? Sure. Take anything you like. They're so small Ijust can't help myself. Laura. Marisa. My real name is Marisa. Marisa, sorry. I'm staying here all week. If you want we could have lunch, or dinner. Whatever you want. - Should I call you? - Sure, call me and we'll see. Bye. Enjoy your meal. Thanks, likewise. See that guy back there? - Excuse me? - Ramon Segovia. He's the one you should fire. He couldn't sell to his own mother. Check last year's figures. Excuse me. Are you telling me how to do my job? He's useless. Who really does hisjob, anyway? Who has to clean up his shit? We do. Does that seem fain'to you? Excuse me. - Got 5 minutes? - Sure, Ramon. Come in. Thank you. Please, sit down. Listen... I know that... I haven't sold a lot. But it's that I'm not well. I'm not well. My wife... Last year my wife was diagnosed... First they said she'd never see again, then they said she'd never walk again, and in the end, they didn't know how to treat her. And I... For 7 months I did everything. Everything. I prepared her meals, washed her, combed her hair, turned her over in bed so she wouldn't... It's very hard... seeing the person you love like that and not being able to help. But it ended up working out. She got better. And... And a couple of weeks ago I got home and she wasrt there. She'd left, just like that, without saying where or why. Nothing. Not even a note. Nothing. I'm sorry, forgive me... What bastards. I'll be right back. What is this? - What you asked me for. - Is it? What did I ask you for? Check the money. How much? - Four grams, right? - That's four grams? Four grams, straight up. Give me my money. Just give me my money. Take your stuff and give me back my money. What, don't you trust me? My bike is outside. We can weigh it back at my place. - You're not from around here. - Why? - What's your name? - And you? - Julio, you? - Jesus. - How long you been at this, Jesus? - And you? My money. Leave that there a second. I won't touch it. Leave it there, I won't touch it. Let's start over, Jesus. From the beginning. How much are four grams at 60 a gram? 240. Good, 240. Here are your 240 euros... and my four grams. Is that right? What, you don't trust me? Your bike is outside, we can count it at your place. Are we good? What do you think? You owe me one, Jesus. Rememberthat. You owe me one. So keep your cell phone on. And a little advice, Jesus. Next time change your shirt. It stinks of fried food. That's not good for a drug dealer. - You took something. - Me? Let's see. - Let me see your nose. - No. - Show me... - No. - Let me see it... - No, I won't let you. Okay, okay. Manuel, say something to him! "Manuel, say something to him!" - Give up? - Yes, I give up. Not "Yes, I give up. " "Yes, sir. I give up. " "Yes, sir. I give up. " Want some? What is it? A line. Not ifit's M. You don't like M? No, I get sick. How about coke? Guess which hand and it's my treat. Let's go. Don't look. Don't look? This is paradise. Don't look at them. What do you want me to do? Look at the floor? Look at me. Come on. Stop looking at my tits. I see you. It's them. It's them. Look at your nipples. You're either happy to see me or you're cold. And it's hot in here. Or the M is hitting you. Get a glass for Manuel. Show them to me. - What, my tits? - Yeah. Let me see them. We're friends, right? I've never seen them. And you never will. I'm just curious. I'm really not into big tits. They remind me of my mother. I must be going through my oral stage. What do you do if you're with a girl with big tits? Ask herto read a story? No. I ask her to let me see them. Forget it, Julio. I'm not going to. - Not even just one? - Not even one. What are you doing? It's fair, right? I show you my cock, - you show me yourtits. - Put that away. Let's find a room and get lost for a little while. Julio... Julio, please. Julio, stop it! It's me, Julio. Your buddy. You see? It's just a little joke. I don't like your jokes. Arert you forgetting something? Fuck you. Give me 50 euros or I'll tell everybody what you did. Over here. Been sitting there long? What did you see? Everything. What have you drunk? Nothing. Look, come closer. Rum and Coke. I know where the bottles are. - How? - Because I know everything. I live here. How about I give you 15 euros and you go to bed? 25. 15. 20. - 20. - Okay. Let's go. - There's a problem. - What? I don't think I can stand up. - You look like Justin Timberlake. - Never heard of him. - Only older. - Ouch! See who that is. Put me in bed first, dummy. Or I'll throw up on you. - Who is it? - Jonathan. Turn it off. He's a nobody. Is that you in the photo? How old are you, Nuria? How do you know my name is Nuria? Because I know everything. More than 10 and less than 30. Is that tattoo real? Of course not, silly. I'm 12 years old. Come here. Come here. Come here. Take off my shoes, I can't reach. I think I'm falling asleep. Go to sleep. Hey, chump. My 20 euros. Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you. Have you seen Manuel? Are you okay? What's wrong? I lost a sandal. I had two before. Now I only have one. I lost it. You have pretty feet. Anyone evertold you that? Don't worry. It's already after midnight, right? You won't turn into a pumpkin. Was that a smile? Look at me. A smile? What's with that shirt? Where were you, at a flea market? You look handsome. Handsome, she says. He looks like the beach patrol. No, I don't! Let's go. - Where? - I don't care. Anywhere else. I'm not going anywhere - with this porn actor. - Why not? Stop, stop! Here? Yeah, here. Where are you going? Don't leave. No, I'll be right back. Buddy! - I want three of these. - Two? Three.

It has Wi-Fi, it's like a computer with Wi-Fi. - Never heard ofWi-Fi? - Why do I need Wi-Fi? I don't know, Jesus. Keep it... or sell it. Give it to your girlfriend. Or your cousin. Do whatever you want with it. It's all I've got. Let me see your watch. My watch? Your watch, let me see it. Are you sure? Look closely, Jesus. It's a PDA. A computer with Wi-Fi. You can chat with Wi-Fi. Ever heard of Wi-Fi, Jesus? Stop going on about the damn Wi-Fi. I'm not interested. The watch or nothing. I'll give you two grams. Not two grams, Jesus. Look at the watch.

Down here... Gotcha! - I have to go, Ana. - No, don't leave. I have to. Really, I'm late. You still haven't worn the sandals I gave you? Acouple times, but they hurt my feet. Want me to make coffee? What's so funny? You're unbelievable, Ana. You won't give me a drawer but you'll make me coffee at 7 AM? What's that got to do with it? Go back to sleep. - I'll call you later, okay? - Okay.

Julio, stop it! Leave her alone. Who are you? She said stop. And you? It's okay. Who are you? I don't know you. Who are you guys? What the fuck are you doing here? What the fuck are you doing here? - Julio, go to bed. - I'm not going to bed. You're in bad shape, Julio. No, I'm not! I'm not in bad shape. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. You and you... You two are faggots. Faggots, both of you. You two are faggots. You two are faggots and you're a whore. A slut and a tease! You're a slut and a tease! It's my first time with two guys. Wait. Slower. Relax. Come here. Come here. Give me your cock. Give me your cock. You're not staying? I can't. Why not? It's early. I have to work. I'll take you. Really, I can't. Got a euro forthe bus? Yeah. In the jar on the washing machine. Niebla. Come here.
