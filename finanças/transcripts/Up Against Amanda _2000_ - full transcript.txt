(suspenseful music) (water splashing) (tense music) (bubbling) (knocking) - What? - [Man] Amanda, you in the tub? (water splashing) - Yes. - [Man] Open up and let daddy in. - No! (knocking) - [Man] Don't make me mad Amanda, only make it worse on you this time. I told you since we ain't related there ain't nothing wrong with it, I ain't your real daddy. Lemme in! (knocking) (tense music) (shower curtain clattering) (splashing water) (suspenseful music) (doorknob ratting) Come on now, open up! Get up, and open this door right now! - Please make him go! - I ain't gonna tell - Make him - you again! - go away! Please make him go away! - Amanda... - (sighs) Please! Just make him go... Please, please, please! Who was I talking to? Myself, that's who. The only person I could ever really talk to. Until they let me out at least. - Hello Amanda. - [Amanda Voiceover] Hi back, freak. - As of today, your court mandated treatment period is over. - [Amanda Voiceover] Right, so if I'm a good little girl, maybe you'll finally let me out of this hole. With Dr. Arnold's help of course. My best buddy! Or should I say, bed buddy? If they only knew. All I have to do is keep getting you off and you'll get me off, right? - Water? - As long as I keep my mouth shut. - She's shown no signs of aggression. - [Amanda Voiceover] Don't want to lose your precious job. Too dangerous to risk getting caught here, huh? Not that there's any end to it. The deal never changes, only the scenery. (thumping) (birds chirping) (door slamming) - No. I haven't met the tenant. But get this, they paid all 12 months, in advance. (chuckles) Yeah it's a little weird, but, the owner said "do it" so, who am I to argue? (knocking) - It's open. (tense music) - Amanda. Honey you did great. I got you a gift. - For me huh? - And I brought you something much more important. Don't forget, you need to continue taking two of these a day. (suspenseful music) (tense music) Here you go. That's my girl. I'm gonna take such good care of you Amanda. I've already rented a house for you. (eerie tense music) - What if your wife finds out? - Amanda, what do you take me for? Remember Mrs. Phillips? The catatonic? - The drooler? - Seems the old vegetable is heir to a small fortune, better yet, there's no friends or relatives to speak of, so I leased the house for you, in her name. There's no connection to me whatsoever. And the same thing goes for the car I'm giving you. And if you're a good girl, there's a lot more where that came from. Now um, put the lingerie on. (haunting tense music) - It's cold in here. (ominous music) (spitting) (water gurgling) (haunting tense music) (bubbling) (relaxing music) - Rich? Richard? (screaming) (clattering) (dispirited music) God what's wrong with you? (sighs) Look what you made me do! - Sorry. - What in the world were you trying to do anyways? See how long you could hold your breath? - No I was breathing underwater. - Right. - No really, this thing has air holes in the side, where the bubbles come in, and if you press your lips up against them real tight, you can actually breath in air from it. - I'm sure that will come in real handy. Uh, look at this mess. - Just forget about it! (water splashing) - (laughs) Hey! (water splashing) (whirring) (bubbling) (pleasant music) (chuckling) (sighing) (shrill electronic ringing) (sighing) - Somebody's at the intercom. - Mmf, uh, it's Saturday morning. (shrill electronic ringing) Oh don't answer it. - (sighs) Oh, come on Laurie it's practically noon. - (moans) If it's that important they'll come back later. - I'm answering it. - Oh Richard don't god... (sighing) Oh... - Hello? - Hey dude! - Hey Buzz. (sighing) - Buzz? Oh it figures, that guy's got way too much time on his hands. (birds chirping) - Look out your window man! They finally rented that place out, (pants) uh, to the American dream you got to take a look man! (pensive music) - Damn! - What are you looking at? - Huh? Oh uh, our new neighbors have some nice uh, flowers. (intercom clacking) (sighing) (haunting pensive music) - [Buzz] Hey guys! You need some help with that? - [Amanda] Who are you? - Uh, h-hey (chuckles)! I'm Buzz! Looks like you're planning to plant some flowers around the place, spruce it up a bit? - Well I don't need a gardener if that's what you're asking. - (chuckles) No... I live right across the street, I just came by to welcome you to the neighborhood. - Just because the gate is open you think that gives you permission to just come onto private property? - (scoffs) Whoa, hey hey hey, take it easy! I just, I'm just trying to be nice! I mean, as to good news and bad news though is uh, I was sent here by the fashion police to, repossess that bathing suit (chuckles)! (chuckles) I mean, I just, I'm just messing with you all right? I like the bathing suit, eh-eh, it fits good on you. (coughs) Hey, that's uh, second hand smoke you know. Second hand smoke kills. - It's not the smoke that kills. (ominous music) It's the smoker. (water splashing) (tense music) - Damn! Um, um um um... (packing paper rustling) (pensive music) (gasping) (poignant music) (banging) (weeping) (banging) (ship's horn blowing) (relaxing rock music) (waves crashing) - Ladies and gentlemen, appearing for the first time here at the Naga, please put your two hands together for Laurie Kerrigan! (applauding) (cheering) (rock music) - Thank you. - (mumbles) take look at your - Richard! - [Announcer] local traffic, wow it's bumper to bumper on 405! - [Richard] Yeah I'm her husband! - Gridlocked on 10 all (siren wailing) the way through (mumbles)-- - No, no, please just tell her that I'm stuck in traffic and I'm just running a little bit late.

(Laurie singing) - Okay. ♪ Goodbye, Mr. Jones (audience applauding) (audience cheering) You couldn't have left a little early? This was an important night for me! - Baby I got here as fast as I could! - Yeah, well Shelly sat by herself for over an hour! You could have been talking to her the whole time! - Will you relax! I talked to her okay? - You did? - Yeah. - Well what'd she say? - She thought you were fantastic. - (chuckles) She did? Well, aren't you happy for me? - Of course I am! - You don't seem very happy. - Laurie come on I'm your biggest fan, you know that! I want you to go straight to the top! - (sighs) Forget about the top, what about the middle? - (sighs) Laurie-- - Look, if Shelley signs me to her label, and we have the opportunity to go on tour, do I have your blessing? - How long are we talking? - (sighs) Oh god... - Oh come on, it's not like I'm not gonna support you, I'm just asking is all! How long? - Several weeks maybe. - Where? - All over, you know, Chicago, Atlanta, Vegas, maybe even Europe. - Europe? - It's only a possibility at this point, but if we get the chance, I'm not about to pass it up. - Laurie, wait a minute! Come on! - You missed an awesome set dude. (birds chirping) (tense music) (metallic clanking) (mysterious pensive music) (dog barking) (somber music) (tense music) - Hi! (thumping) Whoops (chuckles)! I'm Amanda, I just moved in next door. - Hi. Richard! (Amanda chuckles) Nice to meet you. (crow cawing) My wife would really like to meet you too. Um, she's just out of town at the moment. - Hmm, that's funny. - What? - Well most men forget all about their wives when they meet me. I can see that you're different. I like that. Well, feel free to borrow a, cup of milk, or sugar, or whatever else you might need. Isn't that what new neighbors are supposed to say? - (chuckles) Actually I think that's a little old fashioned but the sentiment's nice. - So maybe I'm a little old fashioned. (haunting tense music) (engine rumbling) (knocking) - Amanda! (doorbell ringing) (sighing) (crickets chirping) (tense music) (gate clattering) Amanda, what are you doing outside? It's time to come inside. - It's been more than eight years since I could look up and see the stars at night. - I couldn't get in with my key. Did you change the locks? - No. - What are you doing? - Don't you remember? You said planting a garden would be good therapy. I thought you'd be proud of me. - Well that's, great Amanda, (suspenseful music) but, you dug the hole too deep. (metallic thudding) (grunting) (thumping) (ominous music) - No, I didn't. Oh and by the way I, skipped the pills today (giggles). (brooding music) (deep breathing) (moaning) (dramatic music) (panting) (suspenseful music) (chains rattling) - Help! (dramatic music) Help! (tense music) Help, help! (dramatic music) (eerie tense music) (haunting music) (banging) (banging) (banging) - Let's play doctor! (clattering) (tense music) (suspenseful music) (Arnold mumbling) (Arnold grunting) Aww, it's frustrating isn't it? (Arnold mumbling) But you know, I kind of like you this way. I feel like I can really talk to you. Let you know how I feel, what my needs are! (heavy breathing) How come nobody loves me? My mother never loved me. I never knew my real dad, my stepdad well, he did it to me. And after that it seemed like everybody did it to me. Like that's what I'm here for! You know what? I'm okay now. That's all in the past because, I found this really nice man, right next door and, I think he's perfect for me. Anyway, (chuckles), I thought of a way, for you to be able to relate to me. You know, see what it feels like to be a woman, the way that a man like you treats a woman. To be like, totally vulnerable, and have something long, and hard, and hot, inside of you that, maybe you don't really want there, you know? (muffled shouting) (Amanda chuckling) (Arnold mumbling) (chains rattling) (Arnold grunting) (muffled screaming) (foreboding music) (tape ripping) (Arnold mumbling) (Amanda chuckling) (smacking) (Arnold grunting) Isn't this fun? It's like a pig roast! And all we have to do, is wait for the little piggy to slow, (timer clicking) cook, hey? (timer ticking) (Arnold mumbling) (Amanda chuckling) Oh, (Arnold mumbling) what's that? What's that Dr. Arnold? (chains rattling) Did you say that you wanted me to leave you alone, so you can think about what a bad boy you've been? (Arnold groaning) Okay, I'll come back when you've had a chance to uh, simmer down a little. (dramatic music) (chains rattling) ♪ Yeah it's a hard lesson (soulful rock music) ♪ But I learned (tense music) (grinding) (door slamming) - You want to trade a car for a cab ride?

(phone beeping) (sighing) - I must look totally ridiculous wearing nothing but a towel but, a man was staring at me through my bathroom window while I was taking a shower and I just was totally freaked out! - Wow, you mean just now? - Yeah (pants)! - Hi, my name is Amanda Lear, I need to report a peeping Tom staring into my house while I was in the shower! Uh, 17529 Warner. Yes. Oh no, I-I mean I just threw on my towel and came over to my neighbor's house to call you, I didn't want to stay in my house! Uh-huh. Okay, I will.

(tense music) - [Richard] Here you go. - Thank you. - Sure. - Is that a security camera? - Well yeah, we have four of them, why? - It looks like it's pointing right into my yard. - Uh well, it's never been an issue because the house has been vacant for so long but I, I can move it, it's not a problem. - I appreciate that, what I was thinking is if the peeping Tom - Oh. - was... - I get what you're saying. Come on let's go check it out. - Everything's connected to your computer? - Yeah. - I have a computer, maybe I should get a security system just like you have. How does it work? - Oh well it's really simple. Every few seconds the computer catches an image from each of the four cameras. - Doesn't that fill up your hard drive? - No. Re-writable disk. Every few weeks when it gets full, it just generates new files over the old ones. - Wow that's great. - Yeah. (suspenseful music) (warning beeping) - Oh my god! - What? - I left my door wide open! Can you go close it for me Richard, please? - Yeah but what if the cop-- - What if he steals something, Richard please! - I-- - Please! - Okay! I'll be right back!

He let me use his phone to call you guys! - Uh (sighs), sorry Mr. Pierce, we just had to be sure. - Forget it! - Simple mistake, right? - You guys should be at my house looking for the freak! - Calm down ma'am, we've already done a perimeter search, and our backup is doing a followup as we speak. - Richard I'm so sorry! I'll make it up to you, I promise. - Don't worry about it. - Ma'am I want you to come with us, and go back to the house, and tell us exactly what happened, we'll file a report and get out of your hair, okay?

You come for that cup of milk? - (chuckles) No actually I was just wondering if you've seen my dog?

(door thumping) - [Richard] Wag come on! - Wag, come on buddy, (whistling) come here! - Come on Wag! He never leaves the yard though. - Wag! - Wag! Come on boy! - Wag! - My wife's gonna kill me. She totally loves that dog. (bird shrieking) - Hey that sign just reminded me, I got one of those Neighborhood Watch flyers in my mailbox yesterday, I think there's a meeting this week. You should go to that and tell people about Wag. - That's a good idea. - Uh-hmm. (crickets chirping) - Okay before we get started on tonight's discussion on the topic of vandalism, we have some announce-- Yeah. - Remember last month the topic was on gun safety? - Yeah. - You remember how you mentioned at the end of the meeting that accidental deaths were because people didn't keep their guns locked up? - Right. - Well, what good is a gun if it's locked up? I mean, at my house, we keep the gun right next to the bed, loaded, so if anybody busts into our house, (clucks tongue), pow. (tense music) See what I'm saying? - You got kids? - No. - Well, moving right along. (laughing) Uh, I'm just saying there are, we have a few announcements uh, Richard'd like to say a few words about his missing dog. If you want to come on up Mr. Pierce. - Hi everyone. I'm sure you've seen these around the neighborhood. His name's Wag, and he's a really great dog. So if you see or hear anything we would really appreciate you giving us a call. The number's on the flyer. Thanks. (applauding) - It's so sad. (mysterious music) If he ran away though he's bound to come back, Richard. - [Man] Okay, Cathy I believe you have something you wanted to say? - Yeah real quick. Uh, we need a new volunteer to distribute flyers to everybody's mailboxes. (tense music) - Oh, hi, um, I'm Amanda Lear, I'm new in the neighborhood, but I'd be happy to be your flyer person. (applauding) - Okay, we can finally get started here, uh... (rustling) (tense music) (ominous music) (clicking) (beeping) (tense music) (birds chirping) (heavy breathing) (electronic warbling) (telephone ringing) (static hissing) (clicking) - Hello? - Hi Richard! - [Richard] Laurie? What's going on, I thought you said you were coming back this morning? - Oh I know, but this CD's getting such great press that Shelly was able to line up a couple of gigs in Vegas! Isn't that great? So, we're gonna be gone (balls clacking) a little while longer. (fountain clacking) Any news on Wag? - [Richard] No. (classical music) - Laurie the cab's here, (mumbles). - [Laurie] Know what, the cab's here, I gotta go! - Hey wait a minute! How much longer did you say you were gonna be in Vegas? - Probably not more than a week, tops! - Well then, why don't I just fly up and join you this time? - (mumbles) Richard, we'd barely get a chance to see each other. - (scoffs) I think I'm starting to get the picture. - What? - I think you don't want people to know you're married. - Well, It does look better if people think I'm single. It's nothing against you, just that image thing you know? - Oh come on Laurie, I'm in the business for crying out loud! I'm a music critic, remember? (music echoing) - Look, I really gotta go, I'll call you later okay? (balls clacking) - Great. - Bye. (telephone clunking) (dial tone buzzing) - Dammit!

(latch clattering) Hi. - What'cha doing? - Oh, I'm replacing a bad switch on this automatic timer. (whirring) (bubbling) Was there, something you needed? - Oh I'm, I'm sorry to bother you I, I kind of need a man. - [Richard] How big is it? - [Amanda] It's pretty big. - Wait a minute. That's it? That's the big hairy spider? - Well... (chuckling) - You made it sound like it was some sort of big Black Widow or something. That's just a harmless little spindly spider. - Well... - Jar please. (telephone beeping) (telephone clunking) - Aren't you gonna kill it? - No. This is a good one. Not all spiders are bad you know. The good ones kill all the pests. I'm just gonna turn her loose, and, let her do what she does best. - Oh, your clothes, I still have them. - No rush. - You don't mind if I bring 'em back tomorrow, I want to wash 'em. - Yep, no problem. - Okay. - And in local news, authorities remain baffled by the disappearance of Dr. Joseph Arnold, Chief of Staff of Parkside Psychiatric Hospital, who's been missing now for several weeks. Authorities say they have no leads at this time but the investigation continues. We take you know to Parkside Hospital where our own Jillian Brussard is standing by live with the latest for us. Jillian? - Ron, Parkside Hospital issued a statement today, requesting the public's assistance in solving this mysterious case. (telephone beeping) The hospital is offering a $25,000 reward - Hello? - for any information - Hey Richard! - leading to the discovery-- - We're gonna be a couple days longer! They loved us Richard! Benjamin asked us to stay another week! How are you doing? Taking good care of yourself I hope. - [Jillian] We spoke with-- - Oh I'm fine. (tense music) - You sound like you're in a bad mood. - What do you expect? This has been going on for over a month now. You know how am I supposed to sound? - You don't have to get snippy. You could at least act like you're happy for me. - Oh you know, I love how you twist things around so that I'm the bad guy all the time. - I didn't call so we could get into another fight! - [Richard] Well then why did you call? (knocking) - Show time! - Look, I gotta go. - Fine. (bubbling) (water splashing) - Knock knock! (latch clicking) (tense music) Just returning the clothes. - Okay. You can just set 'em anywhere. Wow, what's this? - Just my way of saying thank you. - It's quite a feast. You made all that yourself? - Yeah, most people have no idea what a great cook I am. I can cook almost anything. Well enjoy it. - Hey wait! You want to join me? I mean, you have your suit on and everything. - Well, I don't want to impose. - (chuckles) No imposition at all, really. I could use the company. - [Amanda] To tell you the truth, so could I. (tense haunting music) - Mmm. That was delicious. - Thank you. - Where did you say you got this wine? - It was a present. - From who? - A man. - [Richard] (chuckles) Yeah. - Who I'm not seeing anymore. - Oh. Are you seeing anyone? - No. Well before I moved here I went through kind of a rough split. (sighs) So I've been kind of lonely lately. (Richard chuckling) - I know what you mean. Uh, my wife is a singer and she's been out on the road a lot lately. I guess I'm not used to it. - It's not something you get used to. (tense music) (Richard chuckling) - Last call on the alcohol. (Amanda giggling) (Richard chuckling) (Amanda giggling) Okay, okay. - Tell me. - This is the best part. It's one o'clock in the morning, the concert's been over for like, forever, and I have been waiting in the press room all night long, just to shake the hand of the living legend. (chuckling) He decides not to come out of his dressing room. (Amanda sighing) (chuckles) Can you believe it? So I'm all depressed, I decide to go back to my hotel room but there's this little piano bar in the lobby and, so I figure I'll go get a drink. You'll never guess who's there. (chuckles) Yeah, Frank. Old Blue Eyes himself, in the flesh. He's sitting there, sipping a Jack Daniel's and kibbitzing with the piano player. - Oh wow! Uh, w-what happened then? - Well I just, nonchalantly walked up to him and introduced myself. And not only did I get to meet him, he gave me an interview, an exclusive! (sighs) It was practically the best piece I ever wrote. (Amanda giggling) (chuckles) After that, no more freelancing for me. I got job offers from every major musical publication in the country. - Awesome. - And I accepted a job offer from Rolling Stone Magazine and asked them to head up their internet publishing division because, (sighing) I wanted to spend more time at home. - I'm glad. You know what else? - What? - I'm not wearing any clothes. (tense haunting music) It feels better without them. - Wait... - Please. (mumbling) You don't have to do anything really. (lips smacking) Is it okay if I just touch? (sighing) (lips smacking) - Amanda... - I like how you feel, (water splashing) up against me. - [Richard] Wait a minute. (whirring) (bubbling) - How 'bout you? Tell me you don't want me. (lips smacking) You can't, can you? (hauntingly sensual music) Please Richard! It's been so long since I had a man. Mm, so long... Come inside where it's warmer... (bubbling) (telephone beeping) (machines jingling) (guests chattering) (tense music) (telephone beeping) (machines jingling) (guests chattering) - [Laurie] So how was your sister's wedding? You said I was sorry I couldn't make it, right? - [Richard] What else could I say? - [Laurie] If it makes you feel any better, the airports and all the traveling, no fun, believe me. I've never been happier Richard! You're gonna just love the new CD, Shelly's a great producer! - That's nice. - All the way back from the plane I was thinking, I have such a great husband and such a nice life! Oh... (suspenseful music) (birds chirping) It's so good to be home. (lips smacking) (birds chirping) (haunting tense music) (lips smacking) Everything's gonna be great. - He's mine now, bitch. (birds chirping) (grandfather clock bells ringing) (Laurie sighing) - What are you thinking about? - I guess I just missed you, a lot. - Oh honey, I missed you to. Just because I have to spend a little more time than normal out on the road these days doesn't change anything. This is my year Richard! You know this is the blitz, this is my best chance to make it big! - I know. And I want you to, I really do. I, I just want to be a part of it. (sighing) - You're right.

(brooding music) - Amanda! You mad love to me in your hot tub, don't you recognize my voice? - Um, hi, uh, can you hold on just a second? (suspenseful music) (door thumping) Hi Amanda, uh, sorry about that. Sorry about, everything actually, um. - What are you talking about? - Well you know, I mean, we both got a little drunk, and, and um, we were feeling a little lonely and I just-- - Don't you dare! Richard, I am not the kind of girl that you just screw around with and throw out like the family pussy! - Whoa whoa whoa Amanda that's not what I'm saying! - Then what are you saying? I fell for you, in a big way, I love you Richard! - Well, that's really very flattering and-- (knocking) Hold on a minute. - I don't remember hearing you make any complaints in the hot tub! - Why'd you lock the door? - Did I lock it? - (chuckles) Look I'm going to the store, do you need anything? - Maybe I should just tell you wife what happened and let the two of you sort it out. - Who are you talking to? - A, credit card company just uh you know, big promotional deal. (Laurie groaning) - I just hang up on 'em. You're way too nice. Mm! (lips smacking) I'll see you later. (tense music) (door thumping) - Amanda. Amanda, are you still there? - [Amanda] I'm always here for you Richard. (Richard sighing) - Look, why don't we meet somewhere, let's, let's just-- - For lunch? - Yeah, that's, that's fine, what-what whatever you want. - Well that's more like it. (birds chirping) (brooding music) - Hi. - Hi! Um, isn't it great out! Let's go sit on the grass, come on! (haunting music) I made you one of my famous submarine sandwiches. It seemed fitting. You're not gonna make me eat alone, are you? (child shouting) - Thank you. - Oh, I got you a present. - Amanda wh-- - It's nothing, really. Just open it, please. (package rustling) When I saw it I thought of you because, you're so nice to me and you make me feel safe. (paper rustling) Like a guardian angel. (tense music) - Amanda, this is really very sweet, but I can't accept this, I, don't deserve it. - Don't say that! - Look, I like you. - I like you too. I like making love to you even more. - Amanda, you're an extremely attractive girl, that's obvious. But I'm a married man. My wife and I were having problems but, we're working them out. - Don't insult me Richard, okay? You think I don't know what a breakup talk is? You think I'm an idiot? I can't believe this is happening again, I thought you were different! Why is it that every man that I meet just wants to use me and throw me away like a piece of garbage! (rattling) (sighing) - Amanda it was never my intention-- - Don't talk to me about your intentions, Richard! Tell me what did I ever do to make you treat me like a whore, huh? (birds chirping) Richard I just want to be friends, okay? (tense music) (weeping) Is that such a bad thing? I just want to be able to talk to you, you know really talk to you!

That song was dedicated to my dedicated and very wonderful husband Richard, the first critic who ever really encouraged me, I appreciate him more than he knows. Hmm... (chattering) - Pimp town! (haunting music) Dude, you're blocking traffic. Hey look, Amanda's here. (soulful music) (chattering) (tense music) - So he came up to me after the concert and that's how we met. - (chuckles) That's so romantic! - Oh well hi Richard! Laurie was just telling me how wonderful you are. - Hi Amanda (chuckles). I'm sure she was exaggerating. (lips smacking) Great set. - Thanks. (sighs) You never told me how pretty our new neighbor was. - (chuckles) I guess it never came up. - Or that she had a problem with peeping Toms. I guess you were quite the chivalrous one. - I wouldn't say that I um, I just let her use the phone. - Oh, pay no attention to him, he was a doll, and incredibly understanding about the whole thing. You're a very lucky woman, most people would never even think of letting a complete stranger into their home, especially one dripping wet and naked? He was the perfect gentleman. - Really? - (chuckles) She wasn't naked. - Well, practically. But he never even looked at me, he looked away the whole time. - Hmm, how 'bout that? (chuckling) - Yeah, how 'bout that? (amplified guitar music) - Well that's my cue. (audience applauding) It was so nice to meet you. I'm sorry, I forgot your name. - Amanda. - Amanda. Now that we're neighbors I guess we'll be seeing a lot more of each other. - I hope so. Oh no, it looks like we ordered the same things, (bottles clacking) is that one my drink or, is that your drink? Oh, I can be such a ditz sometimes. - I guess it really doesn't matter. You're not sick are you? - Not that I know of, how 'bout you? - Not that I know of. I guess we'll both just have to take our chances.

But his vocal cords are history. - Ouch! How 'bout the police, what'd they say? - Hmph, well as far as they're concerned, everyone and anyone could have done it, from the bartender to the cocktail waitress on up. (balls clacking) They don't have enough evidence, to press charges against anyone. - Hey, you think Amanda had anything to do with it? (balls clacking) - I didn't say that. - Yeah I know it wouldn't make any sense anyway, huh, what did Laurie ever do to her? - Maybe it's not what Laurie did. - Ah don't tell me it's something you did. Now you got to be kidding me man. You slept with her? - She seduced me. - She seduced you? - She did! Look, (sighs), I'm not gonna get into an argument about this with you! It was only once, I told her it was a mistake, and I've regretted it ever since. - Hmm, now she's not gonna leave you alone. (whistles) You hit the jackpot on this one buddy. Well, (sighs), if she did it you're gonna have to get some evidence on her, so you can turn her over to the police. (balls clacking) - Like what? - I don't know. How 'bout that peeping Tom story, I mean, maybe she made that whole thing up? Did you ever check the security video on your computer? - Believe it or not I think she deleted the file. (balls clacking) - Wait a minute. What part of her house can you see with your security cameras? - Well nothing now, but I used to be able to see part of her backyard. - Used to? Did she ask you to move your cameras? - (sighs) As a matter of fact, in a way she did. - And why would she do that, unless she has something to hide? - Privacy. - Or maybe she's got something buried back there, maybe she's got a, little doggy, name Wag? - Oh come on, (stammers). - This is getting ridiculous. - What? - We could be blowing this way out of proportion, she could be completely innocent! - Yeah, and she could be completely guilty. You know I've always seen myself as the detective type. - Buzz, don't even think about it. The last thing I need is for you to get mixed up in this. (stick thumping) (balls clacking) - Oh, I'm already mixed up in this. Besides, I might be able to retrieve some information off that disk. - It was erased. - What did they call me in college? - Hackman. (fingers snapping) - So give me the disk, and let me try that. Trust me on this one. (brooding music) (dramatic music) (smacking) - [Amanda] Dammit! (disk drive clacking) (crickets chirping) (pensive music) (eerie music) (engine revving) (shovel thumping) (crickets chirping) (furtive music) (Buzz panting) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) - Oh shit! (panting) Oh shit! Shit! (frenetic dramatic music) (shovel clanking) (grunting) (dramatic music) (frenetic dramatic music) (keys jingling) (door clattering) All right you gotta call Richard! You got to get your gun! (clicking) (dramatic music) - You mean this gun? - Oh, oh god, oh, no... - You've had your eye on me for a while, haven't you Buzz? - No... - But what you didn't know, was that I had my eye on you too. - (pants) My, my wife's gonna be here, any moment! - Great, I'll be sure to say hello to her for you! (gun firing) (dramatic music) You just couldn't stay away from the stink, could you Buzz? Buzz, Buzz, Buzz. And along came a spider. (somber music) (crickets chirping) Um... (keyboard clacking) One less pest. (disk drive clattering) (birds chirping) (crow cawing) (tense music) (sighing) - God this just all seems so unreal. He always seemed, I don't know so up all the time. Did he ever give the impression that he was depressed? (Laurie sighing) We should say something to his wife. (gurgling) (chuckling) - A stiff drink. (chuckling) Sorry about that Buzz old buddy, no pun intended. - Are you all right Richard? (Richard sighing) - I gotta tell you something. - About what? - I don't think Buzz committed suicide. - Oh, what are you talking about? Of course he committed suicide, I mean he was alone in his house, he, he left a note, he used his own gun-- - It doesn't, make, sense! - What do you think, his wife killed him? - No, of course not! - All right, well then what do you think happened? - I think Amanda did it. - Uh, come on! - I'm not kidding around here, I'm totally serious! I also think she was the one who poured the acid into your beer bottle. - Amanda? - Yes! - Our little next door neighborhood watch girl that you're always saying the nicest things about? - She is not what you think. - How would you know? - Because, I just don't trust her. - What'd you do, go and have an affair with her while I was gone? (sobs) Oh my god you slept with her didn't you? - Not exactly. - Don't you even beat around the bush Richard, did you sleep with her or not? - It wasn't my fault, I'm telling you-- - Oh my god, (smacking) you sone of a bitch! - Baby I am so sorry, it was a mistake, (Laurie sniffing) it was totally meaningless! - Meaningless to who (sobs)? - That's not what I meant to... It was once! - Only once. How thoughtful of you! Now you're going and accusing her of killing people too? - What I'm saying is that she's capable of doing something like pouring acid into your drink! - Into my drink? Why wouldn't she pour it into your drink? - Look, I know this is a lot to unload on you right now, but I'm telling you there is something really wrong with her! - I think there's something wrong with you! - Why do you think I'm telling you all of this? I want to protect you! (Laurie sobbing) - Protect me? If that's what you're so concerned about then why the hell did you get involved with her in the first place? Don't try to turn this into some fantasy femme fatale thing Richard! You are the one responsible for cheating on me, period! I never thought I'd have to say this, but right now this minute you just made me-- I can't even stand to look at you! (engine revving) - I'm sorry! (engine revving) (tires screeching) (telephone beeping) Hello. - [Amanda] Gosh, I hope that wasn't about us. (brooding music) Your wife leaving? - Amanda. - [Amanda] Did she find out about us, 'cause I didn't tell her, I swear! - Look, I want you to understand something. You and me, we're over. - [Amanda] Over what? - We're just, we're completely different, okay? - [Amanda] As in, opposites attract? - Look, I just, I made a mistake and that's all there is to it! - [Amanda] You mean by marrying her. (telephone thumping) (sighing) (telephone beeping) (beeping) - Stop calling me! (beeping) (phone clunking) (tense music) (dramatic music) (water bottle clattering) (water splashing) - Why did you hang up on me Richard? - I'm really sorry I hung up on you, I didn't mean to. I'm just, really confused right now, my wife just walked out on me. - I think you need to understand something Richard. (tense music) I love you, period. You're kind, and you're decent. That's why we make such a great couple. Your future is with me, and mine is with you, or we've got no future at all. Don't you see that? - I still have feelings for my wife. Or, or maybe, maybe it's just I don't like the idea of a break up. - I know how you feel. It's normal. And it's okay because before long, you're gonna completely forget about her, I know it. - Look (chuckles), can I fix you something to drink? I'm just really parched. - Oh no, please, let me do it. You've been through enough. (tense music) Would you like a screwdriver? - Okay. - You know why Buzz killed himself, don't you? - No I haven't, uh, been able to figure that out. - It's guilt! He told me he was the one that poured poison into Laurie's beer. He didn't know it was hers, he thought it was yours. He was completely jealous of you, didn't you know that? I mean, he only pretended to be your friend because, he was hoping he could steal Laurie away from you. And she really liked him too you know, that was why she pretended not to. It was a cover. See, Buzz started confiding in me from pretty much the first day that I moved in. And he made me swear never to say anything to you. I felt sorry for you. Well, you know what happened then. But I couldn't betray Buzz. Until that whole thing with the beer, that was when I put my foot down! He even admitted that he tried to get you to believe that I had something to do with it. That was the day before he killed himself. Believe it or not I feel sorry for him. He never loved his wife, he was pining after Laurie from the first day he saw her, and he was only pretending to be your friend because, well, let's just say I don't think Laurie's been faithful to you. (liquid gurgling) (tense music) I know, it's awful. But I can make you forget her Richard, I'm not like her! I'm not the selfish type, I'm the nurturing type. Please let me help you forget her Richard, please? (glasses clinking) (Richard chuckling) - (chuckles) I have a great idea. How 'bout you and I just get away, just the two of us? - Really? - There's this cabin in the woods, it's really secluded, we can just, spend some time together, just you and I. - That sounds wonderful. - Why don't you go to the store, pick up some supplies, you know, something to barbecue and, oh and a bottle of wine. (chuckles) Do you remember the first bottle of wine we shared? - Of course I do. - That was an amazing night. (tense music) I now realize that I've been fighting this attraction for you and I, I can't do it anymore. There's just something, so irresistible about you. - Thank you. - Look, the sooner you go, the sooner I can get my stuff done for the week and then we'll just take off, how's that sound? - Fantastic! - Great (chuckles)! (brooding music) (window clattering) (suspenseful music) (tense music) (suspenseful music) (tense music) (suspenseful music) - Thank you, - Thank you, - that's great, thanks. - thank you very much, have a nice day. (tense music) I'm sorry. (mumbling) (suspenseful music) (tense music) (gate rumbling) (brooding music) (tense music) (window clattering) (screen thumping) (whirring) (bubbling) (frenetic dramatic music) (dramatic music) (telephone beeping) (clicking) (busy signal buzzing) - How many crimes can be going on in this city? (panting) The recorder. I gotta (mumbles). (beeping) - One new message. (tense music) - Richard it's Laurie. I'm at Nicole's house, 555-6387. Call me, okay? (beeping) (telephone beeping) - Hello? Oh, hi Richard! Uh, yeah, let me get her, hang on a second, okay? (dramatic music) - [Laurie] Hi. - [Richard] Laurie! - [Laurie] I'm sorry I left like that Richard, it was stupid (sighs). - [Richard] Laurie look, baby, I told you, Amanda means nothing to me, she's a complete psycho! The important thing is that I finally have some evidence on her! - What kind of evidence? - Have you ever heard of a guy by the name of, Dr. Joseph Arnold? (menacing music) - Who? (crickets chirping) (frantic music) - Look, I just need to call the cops, and then we-- (snapping) (dial tone buzzing) - Richard? - Hello? (crickets chirping) (frenetic dramatic music) - [Automated Voice] The number you have reached, is not in service. This is a recording. - Oh... (busy signal buzzing) (beeping) - Shit! (frenetic dramatic music) (clacking) (tires screeching) (Richard panting) (glass breaking) (tense music) (suspenseful music) (tense music) (gun firing) (frenetic dramatic music) - Uh-oh... (door rattling) (glass breaking) (glass breaking) Ow-oh... (train horn blowing) (train clattering) - Richard! Come out, come out, wherever you are! (Richard grunting) Oh no, did you hurt your little self? Poor baby, let me kiss it and make it feel better! (gun firing) - Oh, oh, ah (sobs)... - Now see Richard, look what you made me do! (Richard grunting) (fence rattling) Don't run away from me Richard, I'm talking to you! (Amanda giggling) (sighing) (crickets chirping) (rattling) Hang on, I'll be right over! (train clattering) (frenetic dramatic music) (warning bells ringing) (clacking) (grunting) (tense music) Oh. (bubbling) (water splashing) (panting) (footsteps thumping) (dog barking) - Richard! I just want you to know that I'm only doing this so that we can be together. I know we can't be together in life, but that's okay, because we can be together in death! (tense music) (bubbling) - Ya! (Amanda screaming) (water splashing) (Richard grunting) (gun firing) (grunting) (gun firing) Get up! (tense music) (gun firing) (crunching) (grunting) (eerie tense music) (grunting) (scuffling) Laurie! (grunting) - Richard? - Get the hell out of here! (gun firing) (bullet ricocheting) (Laurie screaming) (whimpering) (grunting) - But... - Laurie, back the car up! (suspenseful music) - What? Oh... (transmission clunking) Uh... (grunting) - Laurie... Laurie! (grunting) (Richard screaming) Do it! (grunting) (fist thudding) - [Amanda] Laurie! (crunching) (mumbling) - Oh god... (crunching) (Amanda screaming) - Oh, oh god! (Amanda grunting) (dog barking) (Amanda grunting) (door slamming) (bubbling) Richard! (tense music) (thumping) (Amanda grunting) Let me take you to the hospital! - No, take me over there! (panting) (dog barking) (gasping) (choking) (groaning) - Should we call an ambulance? I-Is she.. (dog barking) (tense music) Is her heart beating? Richard? Can you hear anything? (heartbeat thudding) (whooshing) - [Richard] Ah! - Richard! - Amanda please... - [Amanda Voiceover] Please please, please, please, please, please, please... - Drop it or I'll shoot you, you bitch! - Laurie no! - Bitch! - N-n-n-n-no!
