(grinding machinery) - [Blonde] Hey! - [Brunette] That's for jumping ahead of me in the chow line! Next time, I'm really gonna flatten your ass! - [Blonde] You crazy sons of bitches around here! - [Brunette] You bitch! - You two bit hooker! I'm gonna wipe your nose! (dramatic music) - [Brunette] Chicago! Mitzie, help me! (indistinct shouting) (frightened yelling) (indistinct screaming) (alarm blares) (whistle blows) Here! Get that bitch! (indistinct screaming) (whistle blowing) (dramatic music) - You three young ladies are nothing but trouble. Ever since you've gotten here. I think I've finally found a way to get you out of my hair. You should thank your lucky stars, 'cause if it wasn't for this, I'd put you on a work farm so fast it'd make your head spin. A local college has requested subjects for an experiment in human aggression and antisocial behavior. Those do-gooders think they can rehabilitate you with that crap. Well I've decided to let them have their way. I'm going to enroll the three of you in the program. But I'm going to dangle a carrot. If you comply with the program and conduct yourselves like law abiding citizens... You'll be paroled at the end of the semester. - [Brunette] You mean that's it? There's gotta be a catch. - No catch. But you will be given intensive psychotherapy, and your activities will be closely monitored. Now you're all of legal age, so sign here. - Oh oh, wait. I'm gonna have to have my lawyer look at that. - Sign! - [All] Yep. - You break any rules at that school... And you'll be back here before you can sharpen your pencils. Do we understand each other? - Yes sir. - Good. I'm betting you'll never make it. (indistinct chatter) - [Blonde] Gotta go to the bathroom, Vernie? Have fun in there, Vernie! - Yeah, don't fall in the toilet. Look at him walk! (mocking laughter) Hey. Wow, hi. You know, I don't know if want it right now, or not. It's been a pretty long time. I don't know if he could take it. What do you think? - He looks pretty strong to me. (playful laughter) - Do you think he could take the old leg lock? - Well, maybe not the leg lock. - Well what about the lip lock? - No, God no, anything but that. I don't think he could take it, I'm telling you. - I can take it. I can take some of that. - Oh yeah? Well. - Um... He happened to have left the keys in the car. - He left the keys I the car, far out! Get in the car! (indistinct shouting) (playful piano music) - Real cute! - Now these are contracts signed by our subjects, making it possible for us to continue our work. Now I want you all to play close attention because three of you will be assigned to work on a one to one basis with our subjects. You'll share classes with them, you will administer tests, and you will participate in therapy with them. You will also, help them to become socially integrated into the student body. Alright. Carrie Rafferty is our first lady. And she will be Mr. Phillip Ward's project. (admiring whistles) And Leroy, I want you to have Mitzie Marshall. - Not in the biblical sense, I hope, Professor. (class laughter) - And John, you'll be Suzy Keller. - My pleasure. - I have a question. - Yes, Sharon? - Why the sexual discrimination? - I don't follow you. - Well it just seems a little strange to me that no women were assigned to any of these girls. What's your reasoning? - Nothing so mysterious, Sharon. Now you weren't assigned because your specialties are in the lab. But believe me, we're all going to have our hands full. - We all have to make sacrifices, Sharon. - Sir, it says here that she's rather hostile. And expresses her aggression through pranks and vandalism, you know I bruise easily. (mischievous laughter) - Doctor, where will the girls be staying? - At my home. And they should be arriving any time now, I'd better get going. Class dismissed. - Milton! The other two rooms look alright. Did you unpack all the clothes and put them in the right rooms? Oh God, I hope I got the right sizes for the girls. Milton, hurry Milton, for God's sake, they'll be here any minute! - I only have two hands. - Did you prepare the room for that policeman? - You told me to, didn't you? - Now the girls are not to go near there, do you understand? - Yes, Mrs. Blalock. (doorbell rings) - Oh my God, they're here. - Oh marvelous! Marvelous, marvelous. Well you know it might liven things up a bit, Mother. - Try to be civil, Carter. It won't kill you. - Oh well you know I always am, I always am! (doorbell rings) - [Vernon] Hi, I'm Vernon Whitehead. - [Carter] I'm Carter Blalock. - [Vernon] I believe your father's expecting us? - [Carter] Yes, please do come in, do, do. - [Vernon] Yeah, this is Carrie Rafferty. Susan Keller. - [Chicago] Call me Chicago. - [Vernon] Mitzie Marshall. - [Mitzie] Hi. - Hi. Well. Your keeper should be charging his way up the driveway at any moment now. - Well here we are at last. I was just seeing to your rooms. My, what beautiful girls! Let me see now. What should I call you? - You can call me a cab. (mocking laughter) - Very well then, you're a cab. My son Carter, you've already met. - I'm Mitzie Marshall. - You can call me Chicago. - We can all get to know each other better at dinner. Carter, please dear, would you show the girls to the study? - I'd love to. - My husband will be back in a moment. And you can ask him any questions you feel you want to. Well that wasn't so bad, was it? - Any problems with your superiors? - No, everything's fine there. The dean still thinks it's just a routine class experiment. - Oh, good, good. - I'm still worried about possible side effects. - Well, that's what you're going to find out. Testing any new drug takes guinea pigs. It would take years if we were to proceed along normal channels. - I just don't want any trouble. I can't afford a scandal. - As we agreed. That should certainly prove to be enough incentive to ease any last minute pains your conscience seems to be suffering. (smooth jazz music) (birds chirping) - Ladies, you'll find I'm a pretty easy guy to get along with if you'll just do what you're told. But if you step out of line just one more time, you're gonna find yourself back in the joint. Because in spite of these plush surroundings, you're still wards of the state. And I'm the state, understood? Like the lady said, make yourselves at home. - Wow! Can you believe this? - It's really some joint, isn't it? - Yeah. Makes you kinda wonder. - What about? - How can a college professor afford a place like this? - [Chicago] I don't know, maybe his old man had some bread. - Not my old man, my wife's old man. I'm Dr. Blalock. Sorry I wasn't here to meet you when you arrived. - [Mitzie] Hi. - Welcome to Kansas City. - [Carrie] Thank you. - Well did you have a pleasant trip? - [Girls] Yeah. - Good. I trust your stay here will be equally pleasant. I'm sure Vernon explained the rules to you. Now if you have any complaints, please voice them, we speak freely in this house. Now our experiments will concern this particular medication. (eerie music) Now the dosage schedule is right here on the bottle. - What is it? - [Dr. Blalock] It's a mild tranquilizer. - You've gotta be kidding, right? - That'll put a downer in me for three years. - Well, you ladies are going to be under a lot of stress. - What kind of tress, Doctor? - Well, besides the normal stress of attending classes, obeying the rules, learning to socialize, and making passing grades, the therapy sessions are likely to make you rather anxious. - Doc, have you ever been in jail? - Not yet. - Well, until you have, you don't know what stress is. I don't think we need these pills. - Well, humor me, Miss. Keller. - [Chicago] Please, Chicago. - Alright, Chicago. You see, you have to take them anyway because the experiment isn't gonna be valid unless you do, you understand? - Like rolling dice! - Now I've given Vernon the responsibility of administering the medication and keeping a record. Now, I guess that's it. You have the rest of the day to yourselves, and tonight, you'll meet your fellow students. I've planned a party at my club. (swinging disco music) - [Carrie] Hi. - Hi. - Can you believe how gorgeous Blalock's son is? - Oh God, I don't know about that. This party is so boring. Right? (playful laughter) I'm gonna take care of that. Right now. Bye! - Bye bye. - [Sharon] You know, you could get out of this assignment if you tried. - And why should I do that? - Oh, don't be funny. - Look, you're being childish. - Oh don't give me that crap, John. - Just relax, will you? - Look, I don't like the idea of you spending so much time with a character like that. I mean, switch with Leroy. - Why? Think she's gonna rape me? - No, I just don't want her spending so much time with you, that's all. - Welcome to Funny Farm. - [Carrie] Thank you. What are you in for? - Oh... Fun. - Yeah? - Actually I'm just passing through, but to make things-- - Hey man, how you doing? You know, Carter and John and Dale and I, we used to get in a lot of trouble together, right? - Oh yeah? - Well you in town to stay? You got a teaching job, or what? - It all depends. - I have to stay at the west one. - Wait a minute, wait a minute, so how can you tell when an elephant is having its period in a hotel room? - Well let me guess. The mattress is gone, and there's a dime on the dresser! - Well you know it, you know it. I got another one, I got another one. (indistinct shouting) - Look at me! (dramatic music) (indistinct shouting) - Alright, alright people, that's it. Mitzie, get the hell out of the pool! (excited shouting) (playful music) (playful shouting) - Keep your hands to yourself! - I didn't mean to, I mean she was just standing there. - Sorry. I didn't mean for it to get carried that far. - Well that's okay. Why don't I take your girls home right now, okay? - It was just an accident. It isn't as though she did something malicious. - Don't be a fool. - Look, I hope I don't have to remind you whose idea this whole thing is. - Hardly. You haven't had an original idea since I've known you. Did you get the payment? - Yes, I have the check. It's in a safe place. - [Mrs. Blalock] I want to see it. - No need for that Connie, we can't cash it anyhow. It's postdated to the end of this semester. - Well you just better have it! - Look, Connie. We've got a long ways to go on this thing. If it's going to work, you're going to have to cooperate. - Don't lecture me! I've carried you for years. Now you're damn well going to make something work for a change. Don't worry. I'll apologize to the little heathen. - Wanna know what I think? I think they're all pussycats. - Oh, you uh... Getting (mumbles)? (painful shout) - You fucker! You know what? Mitzie's a pussycat, and I'd like to trade with you. - Ah! Sharon's been talking to you. - No, no, she hasn't. I just like Chicago's style. - Yeah will I like her tits. - That your professional opinion, John? - Better believe it. Hell, did you see the ass on Carrie? - Phil, Phil, what about that ass? Phillip! You gonna get some of that ass, huh? - Kidding? I think I just became a spectator. - What do you mean, a spectator? - She won't give me a second look. - Oh Phillip, look, maybe you'd like to switch with Mitzie. - What is the matter with you? I mean, Mitzie looked alright to me. Hell, she showed us everything she's got. - Maybe that's why I'd like to switch. - If John gives me any crap tonight, I'm gonna tell him to take a walk! - My way, I hope. - Did you believe that Mitzie? Geez! - We'd better get dressed, the boys are gonna get tired of waiting on us. - They deserve to wait. - I don't know about you guys, but I'm getting dressed. - Me too. Our position on campus is getting tough. I don't wanna leave dork alone too long, he might get lost. - Alright, I'm going, dammit! When are we girls ever gonna realize that all they ever want out of us is. - Pussy! It's all they ever think about! - Hey, suits me just fine, but I think John's all mouth. - Hey, don't knock it unless you've tried it. - Yeah, I should be so discrete. Seven come 11. Yes. - You guys, Phil is a drag. I mean, he's so boring! It's pathetic! - Yeah, but Phil's got big feet. - And what's that supposed to mean? - Big feet, big ding-dong. - Ding-dong? - Yeah, you know. - Mitzie, (mumbles), feet got nothing to do with it! - Hey, I heard that you can tell by the length between a mans thumb and his forefinger. What do you think? - You think? No. - There's only one sure way to tell and that's by looking, and then you gotta see it in its military position. Know what I mean? - No. What is that? - It's when it stands up and salutes, you know! Hey listen, I've seen some real miracles! I saw one once that went from two to eight in less than 10 seconds. - You're kidding! (playful laughter) - Anything's possible, kids. Come on, seven! - [Carrie] Six. - I don't know about you guys, but I'm going to bed. Come on, Mitzie. - [Mitzie] Okay, right behind you. - [Chicago] Good night. - [Carrie] Good night, we have a lot to do tomorrow. (eerie music) (smooth blues music) - Shit. (upbeat disco music) - [Mitzie] God, this is really a drag! (gentle orchestral music) (playful orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral music) (knock on the door) - Come in. - [Carrie] Hey. - [Mitzie] Hi. - [Carrie] What are you reading? (obnoxious belch) - Catcher in the Rye, it's for Lit class. It's great, uh, oh God! - [Carrie] What's that? - Oh, that. That's an elephant, haven't you ever seen an elephant before? - What the hell are you doing with a poster of a penguin up in your room? - Oh God, I'm a penguin freak, I mean, what can I tell you? I mean I just love those little fuckers. - You're strange. - Yeah, well what did you want, anyway? - I wanted to get your opinion on what you think is really going on here. - Oh, I can't help you. - Why not? - Oh God, I don't have any opinions. - Very funny, Mitzie. - That's me, funny Mitzie. - Do you think something weird is going on here or do you think it's just me? - Oh, that's easy, I mean I'm trying to study, and you're interrupting me about a very strange-- - Goddammit Mitzie I'm serious! Would you cut it out? - I know you're serious and I think you should do something about it. - Oh geez. Do you think something weird is going on here or do you think it's just me? - Oh, yes, yes. - Yes you think there's something weird going on here, or yes you think it's just me? - No. - No what? - Can you repeat the question again? (knock on the door) - Oh God. - Who's there? - [Carter] Blalock. - Blalock who? - Oh. Well I hope I'm not intruding on anything. - You're not. - Listen, I just with Father and he said he'd let you girls out tomorrow afternoon. - [Girls] Yeah? - Yeah. That is, after you finish your exams, and with escorts, of course. - Of course. - And I was thinking maybe you could convince some of the fellows to take you to the drag track. - Why the drags? - Well it so happens, I have a car in the trials. (engine roaring) (indistinct chatter) - [Phil] I like Carter's. (indistinct chatter) - [Carter] Alright, well! - [Mitzie] Far out, Carter! - Where's everybody going? Well I don't think everybody can fit in that one car. Who'd like to go with me? - Carter. Can I talk to you for a minute? - Sure, what can I do for you, Phil? - You know what you can do, you can cut out the shit. - Uh, I beg your pardon. Now what's the matter? - You know what's the matter, she's supposed to be with me. - [Carter] Doesn't look like she wants it that way, Phil. - Look, just because you're Blalock's son, doesn't give you the right to interfere. - Why don't you talk to my father about it? - She's my responsibility! - And you think you can handle that responsibility, huh? - [Joe] Hey, hot shot! - Oh, you're talking to me, huh? - I said hot shot, didn't I? - Well you'd better not fuck with a falcon if you can fly. - Now listen, yore just lucky. - [Carter] When you're hot, you're hot. - Come on, come on, if my truck hadn't have gone out, I'd have made your time look like it was standing still. - Like he said, when you're hot, you're hot. And when you're not, you're not. - Nobody's talking to you. - [Carter] That's not nice, Joe. - [Joe] Are you kidding me? - I think maybe you should apologize. - Stick it in your ear! I don't apologize to no nosy cunt. - I really mean it, I think you should. - [Joe] Stick it in your ear. - I think you should apologize. (ominous music) Think you can handle this responsibility, huh? (suspenseful music) (aggressive shouting) (suspenseful music) Apologize. (suspenseful music) (frantic shouting) - I'm sorry. I mean it! I mean it! - Where's Phil? - To hell with Phil. - Come on, let's go. We'll see everyone later. ♫ Time ♫ Love ♫ And other tragic things ♫ There ain't nothing to believe in ♫ Right now you think you've found true love ♫ But it's your heart that your deceiving ♫ I guess you had your share of troubles ♫ I know I had my troubles too ♫ Seems like life just burst your bubbles ♫ Yeah there ain't nothing you can do ♫ About time love and other tragic things - [Carrie] Carter, don't. ♫ Why try Carter, stop it. No! - [Carter] Carrie. - [Carrie] Carter! ♫ No happy songs to sing No, please! No! No! Please, Carter! No! - Carrie. Carrie. Carrie. - [Carrie] Leave me alone, please! (gentle rock music) - Hey! Carrie! - It's just that... Since I've been taking those pills your father gave me, I've been feeling like a stranger. - No, now, Dad, he knows what he's doing. - Yeah, right. Just seems government agencies had me in their files. I'm gonna get sent back to that farm and your father's playing with my brain! The fucking ozone layer's getting filled with armpit deodorizers, and God knows what else. And people are getting wiped off the face of the Earth everyday. And never found again. - Carrie. Carrie. (sweet orchestral music) - [Carrie] Yeah, it's alright. I'm okay. - Dr. Blalock would like to see you in the sitting room just as soon as it's convenient. - Okay, thank you, Milton. Sweet dreams. - Thank you. Hi, Doctor. - Hello Carrie, come in, sit down. - Thank you. - I was... Just wanted to know whether you girls have any complaints so far. - I don't. Maybe you better ask the others if they do. - Why, yes of course. But, you're perfectly satisfied with the way things are going? - Yeah. Why do you ask? - Well I was just a little curious as to why... You've been avoiding Phil. He has been assigned to write a case study on you, you know? - If I have to see Phil, I'll see him. Just say so, okay? - Well you don't have to, no. We do want you to open up a little. And if you don't feel like you can talk to Phil, I could assign someone else. - It's not necessary, thanks anyway. - Well I was suggesting that maybe I could sort of take Phil's place. You might feel better talking to me, I... I am a psychiatrist, you know? What do you think? - That's true but, I don't think I could talk to anybody that I don't honestly care about. It's as simple as that. - Well, why don't you give it some thought. Maybe when we get to know one another, a little better. I'm not that hard to like. I could be... A lot of help to you, I'd like to be. - Well, thanks Doctor. I've got a ton of studying to do, so I better go. Will you excuse me? - Yes, of course. When you, uh, find out about Phil, let me know, okay? - Well how do you feel about your first weeks here? - Oh boy, it's different. - Well I was gonna go for a walk. How about coming along? - Sure your father wouldn't mind? - Well why should he? - Fathers are like that. - Well, we can always bring one of the others if that's gonna make you feel better, hmm? Yeah! - [Dr. Blalock] Can you describe your feelings, Mitzie? - [Mitzie] Well, I just feel emotional. Like, like a funeral. Or a wedding. I don't know what's wrong with me. - Will you tell us about the penguins again? What is it about the penguins that you like? - I don't know, I mean, I may hate penguins, I don't know! - Alright, Mitzie. Now. I want you to concentrate on this light. Now I'm going to put you under age regression hypnosis. I want you to just relax, and concentrate on the light, and my voice. Take a deep breath. That's it. Now another. That's good. Now just relax and breathe slowly. And now start going back in time. (eerie music) You're 10 years old now, Mitzie. You know where you are? - School. At the orphanage. - [Dr. Blalock] What do you see there? - Walls. Tiled floors. Showers. - Alright now, Mitzie. Can you describe what's happening? - It's cold. The shower... He made me take a cold shower. - He? Who is he? - He won't leave me alone. - [Dr. Blalock] What is he doing? - He's poking me! - And who is he? - He's poking me! Playing with me! - [Dr. Blalock] Who is he? (eerie music) Black. White. He hurts me! - Alright now. Alright now, Mitzie. No, he's not going to hurt you. Just tell me who he is. (eerie music) - Father. (eerie music) Father Max! (eerie music) - The penguin. - He plays with me! - [Dr. Blalock] Alright, alright, alright. - He hurts me! - Alright Mitzie, I'm here. It's alright. Listen carefully, I'm going to bring you back now. - Professor, I'm worried about her. - No need to worry, she'll be alright. Alright now Mitzie, I'm going to bring you back now, listen to me carefully. Now. As I count, you will begin to wake up. You will feel very, very refreshed. One. Two. Three. - Oh, Dr. Blalock, have you seen Mitzie? - I sent Mitzie home. - Oh. - Can I give you a lift? - Oh, no thanks. It's just a few blocks to your house. - You look tired. - I'm not tired. I feel weird though, antsy, you know? - Probably just overworked. - I think it's those pills. Some kind of allergic reaction or something. - No, I don't think that's likely. I still think it's fatigue. You know, maybe I should give you girls the night off. On the town. I think you've earned a little rest. Gotta take a little spending money. Let's see what we've got here. Oh, here's $75.00, that'll give each of you 25. Be enough? - That's plenty, thanks! - My pleasure. Oh, by the way. Phil dropped out of the class today. - Too bad. - Yep, it is. He's a hard worker. Carrie, mind if I say something personal? - I think it'd be better if you didn't, Dr. Blalock. - Carrie, Carrie, Carrie. Why do you... Despise me? - I don't. - [Dr. Blalock] What, then? - I just feel sorry for you. - You really know how to hurt a man, don't you? - I just answered your question. - You must know that I'm... Fond of you, don't you, Carrie? - Just leave me alone, Dr. Blalock. Just leave me alone. - Alright. Carrie, Carrie? I think it might be better for everyone if you... Stopped seeing my son. Do I make myself clear? - [Mitzie] Ha, what a trip! - [Chicago] She really practiced, I mean I heard she had to take real sword swallowing lessons to do that. - She used to go to my ear nose and throat doctor. - Did she? - Ooh, well at least they're free. - Yeah, free to peddle their ass in the meat market. - Yeah, well I don't know about that, but I'm telling you, I really understand why men buy sex. I mean, I am so horny, I would buy it if I had to, I know I would. - What's the matter with John? - Oh Mitzie listen, John ain't giving up no cock. - That's not what Sharon said. - Why you little! - [Mitzie] Come on, I'm only kidding. - I don't like that kind of kidding, Mitzie! - Alright, don't get! Goddammit! - Sharon's an asshole. - Jesus Christ! Are we in this together, or not? What's gotten into you guys? - [Chicago] Yeah, sorry. Then I'm Catholic, does the pope shit in the woods? - [Carrie] You're nuts, Mitzie! - [Mitzie] Hey, I smell money, girls! - [Man] Jesus, will you shoot already? - [Bum] Alright there, alright there, where do you think you're going? This alley don't go anywhere, now get out of here. - Hey, what are you doing here? - What do you mean what am I doing here? I live here. That's none of your damn business. - Yeah man, I just want to get a game. - [Bum] Oh, you wanna be a high-roller, huh? You wanna be a high-roller. You too? - Hey, you just get me in the craps game. - Come on, lets' go. (indistinct chatter) - [Player] Hey, what you got there, some fresh meat? - [Bum] I got some high-rollers, here. - We got all the tail we want. - Hey, they're good players, let them play. - Hey, my name's Chicago. - So who gives a shit? - Is there a game? - Wanna part with some money? - No, I wanna get some more! - Hey, we got a hot one here, let's go! Here we go. - That's two. Seven or 11. - Seven 11. - Seven 11! (indistinct chatter) Shooting craps on a (mumbles). Bottom of the nine! (celebratory shouting) Left of the money? - Eh, it's just beginner's luck. - Okay. (indistinct chatter) - Stop chewing this shit, come on. Here, come on, 10 says you can't. - Don't you worry about that. (indistinct chatter) Come home to mama. (indistinct chatter) (celebratory cheering) Y'all still (mumbles) a girl? (indistinct chatter) What do you mean they're shaved? They're the same dice you've been using since I got here! - [Player] Calling me a liar? - Why no, friend. I'm calling you a shithead asshole dumb head, shit eating asshole faggot liar. - Listen! You girls talk to me like that? - [Mitzie] Hold it friend, hold it! Hey Chicago! Hey look, look, you're not thinking clearly right now, I think you should. (mumbles) realize where we might have to go back and we should give him his money, okay? - Come on, just count. - Okay baby, you got it this time, but nobody, nobody cheats me. Nobody! - Let's go. I'll be back, nobody fucks Chicago! - [Carrie] Come on. Creep! - Lousy ripoff creep! Gotta get out of there! Give me back my $2.00 you old fart! - Go fuck yourself. - If you weren't so old, I'd let you watch. - You ain't no lady. - [Chicago] I don't know how that guy ever found out I switched dice. - [Carrie] You mean you really did cheat? - [Chicago] Of course I cheated, how else was I gonna beat him? - I've never seen you act like that before! (silly laughter) - Woah! Wow! That's the hugest parrot I've ever seen! Oh my, oh God, I've never seen such a huge bird! Look! (frantic shouting) - [Carrie] Mitzie? You didn't like it before! - Oh, oh, oh! - [Carrie] Mitzie! - Oh! Oh gosh, look at this! Oh I gotta have this right now! I gotta have it guys! (frantic screaming) (glass shatters) (dramatic music) (frantic shouting) - [Chicago] Hurry up! (dramatic music) (horn honks) (indistinct chatter) Hey, small world, wow! - [Carrie] What are you guys doing? - [Leroy] Oh, we're just messing around. - [John] We're going to the Fairy Land (mumbles). If you don't hurry up, we're going to be late James. - [James] Relax! - [Chicago] Hey, I haven't been to an amusement park since I was a little kid! - [James] Well. - [Sharon] Oh, we'd love to take you girls along, but. - Now what do you mean now, look, we can all squeeze in here. - [Mitzie] Yeah, fun, let's go! (indistinct chatter) (funky disco music) (cheerful laughter) (playful carnival music) - [Man] Blue! - Where did John go? - I thought I saw him at the fence. - Let's go find him, I'm tired, and I want to go home! (playful laughter) - [John] Now wait a minute, lover. Ow! God, you're really in heat. - [Chicago] I love you so much! - [John] Now cut the cave man stuff, Jesus! Hey come on, let's just, let's find the others. - [Chicago] I want you so bad! - [John] Look, just take a few minutes. - [Chicago] I want you John, I want you! - Ow! What the hell's wrong with you? - John, don't go! John, please! I love you! (frantic screaming) John, don't go! (aggressive growling) I love you! (dramatic music) (aggressive grunting) (frantic screaming) (dramatic music) Like that, baby? Go back in! (frantic screaming) (dramatic music) (frantic screaming) Let me go! I'll kill you! - [James] Guys, we're gonna need a doctor. Janet, you go get a doctor. We gotta get out of here before the police come! - [Carrie] Guys, I'm really freaked! - I'm afraid I'm going to have to confine you to your room for the time being. At least until Sharon decides if she's going to press charges against you. Now when you feel like talking to me, just let me know, and I'll check in with you from time to time. I sent Vernon out for something. He doesn't know anything about this, and that's the way I want it kept, understand? - Why? - Why? I want to avoid sending you back to prison. - Why? - Well what an absurd question. Do you want to go back? - Yes. Send us all back. - We'll see. - Why won't you send us back, Doctor? What's in this for you? - You know Carrie, I've had just about enough of your impertinence. - Alright. I haven't even started, Doctor. Why can't you make a stand on that, Mr. Brooks? Can't you define people or should you just describe them? - [Mr. Brooks] Well that's a matter of opinion. - Well I wouldn't want you to go out on a limb. Look Mr. Brooks, what if a man is torturing somebody? Should he be merely described, or shouldn't he be defined as a cruel man? - Well that would depend, perhaps he's being forced to torture people. Perhaps he's not responsible. - Everybody's responsible for their actions. - [Mr. Brooks] Would you like to elaborate on that? - I'll try to make it clear for you. Look, what if, say a average white collar worker, he leaves work out of this high-rise office building, and he goes down to the surface. There, he climbs into a cannon, and allows himself to be fired through the air. At that point in time, is he a white collar worker, or a cannon projectile? - I'm afraid people are a little too complex to be defined. That's what makes it so difficult to find a moral point of view. - Wrong! That's a lot of intellectual bullshit. People are what they do, if I kill, I'm a killer! - Don't you think you should have motives taken into account? - What about Hitler, do you want to take his motivations into account? What about government invasion of privacy, do you want to take their motivations into account? What about scientists using human guinea pigs? Do you think we should take their motivations into account? - I think we've allowed this discussion to be carried too far. - Are you going to concede to my point? - [Mr. Brooks] Please sit down, Miss. Rafferty. - What is this, Mr. Brooks? - Anybody can plainly see, it's an ashtray. - Wrong! Anyone can plainly see it's a wall breaker! Sit down John, leave me alone! I'm trying to speak for you! I'm trying to speak for all of you! I am the student body! (dramatic music) - [John] Carrie! Carrie! Carrie wait a second! (dramatic music) - I'm telling you, it's no good. It's gotten out of hand. The girls are slowly going mad, I can't continue this. I won't be responsible for what happens. - [Connie] Something's gone wrong, hasn't it? - [Dr. Blalock] Ah, my blushing bride. - I can always tell when something's wrong. Little Charlie has to get drunk and maudlin. - You smell like a French whore. - I thought that's how you liked it. What is it Charles? Have you managed to screw everything for us already? - It's not gonna work, Connie. - "It's not going to work, Connie." How many times have I heard that? - It's falling apart, I think we'd better call it off. - Are you out of your mind? We can't afford to call it off. You can't afford to quit. - Connie, it's getting... Dangerous. Anything could happen. They're exhibiting behavior I hadn't expected, it really is dangerous! - Don't try to frighten me, Charles. You make it work, do you understand-- - Connie, you are not listening to what I'm saying! Those girls might just-- - We have a commitment here! Now I don't want to hear any more of your excuses! - Goddammit, Connie! Can't you shut up and listen to me, just once in 30 years, you're gonna hear me out! Now I can't do this to these girls! That drug is killing them! And commitment or no commitment, I'm gonna put a stop to it! I just hope it's not too late. - Charles! I am not going to let everything slip through our fingers, merely because you have a sudden attack of decency! - Connie, get out of here will you, I've got to think, just get the hell off my back! - God, you make me sick! (gentle piano music) - [Carrie] Carter, I need your help. - What is it, what's wrong? - Maybe you can help me answer that by answering a few questions. - Ask me anything you wish now. - Okay, tell me absolutely everything you know about this program we're in. - Well, I... I guess I should have told you this before. It's not bad, really. Some of the rooms in this house... Are being monitored. - Oh, how? - TV cameras in the air vents. - Vernon, huh? That goddamn peeping tom! - Listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you before, really. - What else? - Well, Father's having a few troubles with certain behavioral patterns. But nothing that amounts to anything, really. - Are you absolutely sure there's nothing else? - [Carter] What else is there? - Carter, can you keep an open mind? - Well I'm trying. - Um... Your father's involved in something illegal. It has something to do with this program. - I think you're wrong. - Come on. Let's go to school. I've got something to show you. - [Announcer] One out away. Two right away. - How's everything look? - Fine, everything's just fine. - Carrie? - Well she hasn't been in her room all night. - She's been under a lot of stress lately. I guess she was more unstable than I calculated. I'm taking them all off the medication as of now. I want you to watch Carrie's room very carefully. Her's and Chicago's. What's Mitzie doing? - She's you know, just laying around, reading a book. - Well I'm not too worried about her. These other two, especially Carrie. - You want me to haul their asses out of here? - Oh no, no, I just want you to keep a close watch on them. And I want two more cameras set up, one in my study, and one in the eating area. - I'll get them right away. - And I want to know when Carrie comes in. - The minute she walks through the door. (ominous music) - And where did you get those? - I stole them from your father. - Well obviously. (suspenseful music) Now will you tell me what you're looking for? - The drug catalog, for one thing. You know, one of those pharmaceutical catalogs with pictures of pills and descriptions of what they do? - So why do you need that? - I'm not sure. - Well great. - Please, just help me find it, okay? I'll explain everything if we find it. (suspenseful music) - Settle down. Settle down! Yes! Yeah, what do you need? - [Leroy] Hi, I'm Leroy. Remember, Leroy? The pool? - [Vernon] Oh yeah, from the party, how are you Leroy? - [Leroy] How you doing. Oh, Dr. Blalock asked me to come by and sit with Mitzie for a while. You know, she's been feeling sick today. - [Vernon] Yeah okay Leroy, that's fine. If Blalock says it's alright, it's alright with me. - This is the room, huh? - What room? - The room with the monitors, Dr. Blalock told us all about the room. - Oh, he tell you about the monitors, did he? - Yeah, he's told us about everything. - Terrific, Leroy. - How important your job is, and he sure speaks highly of you, Vernon. - Thanks a lot, Leroy. - You're watching the game! - Yeah, you a baseball fan? - I sure am. Matter of fact, I'll only be about an hour of so Vernon, and then maybe I'll come back and watch the rest of the game with you. - Yeah, it's a hell of a game Leroy, yeah. - I'll catch you later. - Right Leroy, catch me later. - [Carter] It's what color? - [Carrie] Any color. It could be any color, any shape. - [Watchman] Who's in there? - It's the night watchman. - [Watchman] Open this door! Come on now, I know you're in there. (mumbles). - Mr Jones, it's Carter. Let me finish reading this paragraph. (suspenseful music) Just getting some things for Dad. (suspenseful music) Everything's alright. - [Jones] It's not alright, you're not supposed to be in here. - [Carter] Well, not that I need anyhow. - [Jones] What's them things? - [Carter] These are test papers. They've all got to be graded, you know? Just got the keys. - [Jones] I don't know anything about that. I only know you're not supposed to be in here. - [Carter] Well you can telephone my father if you want to. All he'll say is, everything's alright. - [Jones] Just get your things and get on out of here, I'll talk to your father about it in the morning. - [Carter] Yes sir. (suspenseful music) (knock on the door) - Yeah? Come on in. What are you doing here? You're not supposed to be in here. - I know, I know, I know. Um... I just came to see how you were. I've been thinking a lot about you, and... You're really hot, Mitzie. - [Mitzie] I'm okay. - Um, I think I know the problem. With the stress and the prying into your past, and all that. It's really a drag. - Well I don't feel like talking about that. - Hey. I have a surprise for you. Will you trust me? - I like you but I don't know if I could trust you. - If you don't like it, you don't have to accept it. Come on Mitzie. - Okay. - I was rummaging around the theater department over at school, and I came across this and I know it will help, I know. What I wanna do, is play a game with you. Dr. Blalcok calls it free association, but I call it digging for gold. We dig down beneath the conscious mind into the subconscious. And we just pull out pure gold. Now, it's a game, it'll be fun. Okay, now I'm gonna do things here. Okay? And what I want you to do is just, whatever image comes into your mind, anything you see, just tell me what it is. - Okay. - Anything, and we'll see how it goes. (eerie music) - Okay. (eerie music) (frantic scream) (eerie music) - [Leroy] Hey, watch it Mitzie! Stop it, stop it! Mitzie, stop it! - Oh! Rookie! Leroy, you missed a hell of a game! (eerie music) What the hell is this? (eerie music) (eerie music) (frightened scream) (eerie music) - She's had it. - [Vernon] Dr. Blalock, Mitzie's room! (suspenseful music) - He's alive. - They're crazy. All three of those girls are nuts. - Call a doctor! - [Vernon] Alright. (ominous music) - What's going on here? - Carter, I don't want you involved. - Well I think it involves me when my friends are being hurt! - He'll be alright, now the experiment's just gotten out of hand. - Well stop it! - I already have! We have to call the police. (dramatic music) Yes that's right. It's an orange Chevy. No, I don't think she's armed. She is deranged, however. Thank you. What is it Carrie? I don't have time to talk. - You better make time, Doctor. - [Charles] What are you doing with that briefcase? It is mine, I believe. - That's right. Doctor, you told me you were giving us phenobarbital. You lied. Why did you lie? These are tiny yellow capsules. Phenobarbital are tiny green capsules, I looked them up in this drug catalog. I also looked up the yellow capsules in here and they don't have them. Why do you suppose that is? - [Charles] I don't know Carrie. - It says in here that, nomacaine, an untested drug, can cause feeling of mounting aggression and hostility. Is that true? There's no agency, or at least I don't recognize the name on this letter. Is it a government agency or a privately owned agency? - Well I'll leave you to figure that out. - And here's the spoils. This is your payoff money, isn't it? Payoff, for using us a guinea pigs, $150,000. I also found this letter. From the IRS. You're broke, aren't you, Blalock? - Times are hard, Carrie. Out those things back in the briefcase Charles, and hide them, we'll dispose of them later. I might have known I couldn't trust you with anything. That you'd leave them out where any common thief could get at them. You have initiative Carrie, that was an enterprising thing for you to do. What were you gonna do? Blackmail us with it? - No, hang you with it. - Ah. I moralist. In our family, everything is legal. Even crime. Power is all there is, Carrie. Now. If you just go back to your room, like a nice girl, and wait there... We'll put the pieces together here. No one's going to hurt you, Carrie. I expect you'll be back on the train to the penitentiary by tomorrow morning. That's a good girl. Charles. Let's put these things in the vault for now. Then we can destroy those pills. We might still be able to salvage something out of all of this. At least there's that check. - [Charles] You're incredible. (dramatic music) (siren blaring) (tires squealing) (metallic crashing) (tires squealing) (metallic crashing) (heavy sobbing) (ominous music) - Oh my God! Oh God! (heavy sobbing) (ominous music) (heavy sobbing) (siren wailing) (ominous music) (siren wailing) Open up! God no, how did I do this? How did I do this one? (eerie music) Go away, I'm gonna jump! Go away goddammit, I mean it! I'm gonna jump if you don't go away! I'm not fooling around! Go away or I'm gonna jump! Go away! - Hey you know she's been up there all night. (suspenseful music) - Wanna try and talk her down? - [Carrie] Yeah, can I be alone with her for a few minutes? - Suit yourself, be careful what you say, she's ready to jump. (suspenseful music) - Go away. Carrie, go away! - [Carrie] I came to give you some good news. Hey, it wasn't your fault. Nothing that happened back there was your fault. - [Mitzie] Go away, please! - Dr. Blalock was giving us some kind of bad drug. A drug that makes you do violent things. The drug did it, you didn't do it! You didn't do it, the drug made you do that. - I just... I don't know. I don't know about that. - [Carrie] It wasn't your fault. - [Mitzie] What are you saying? I don't understand what you're saying. - Mitzie, you're under the effect of a bad drug! You didn't do anything. - I killed somebody. I'm gonna have to go to prison for the rest of my life, now. - Come down off the ledge. - [Mitzie] I did do something, I-- - No you didn't, you didn't do anything! You're under the effect of a drug, it's Blalock! Please believe me. - I don't know. - Look, Leroy's not dead. - [Vernon] Dr. Blalock, it's too bad you had me put those monitors in your study. You have the right to remain-- - I know my rights. Actually, it was her idea. - Shut up you fool. - I've never had an original idea in my life. She can verify that. - I said shut up Charles! - Somebody tell me what's going on, here? - Ask her. - [Vernon] Come on, Blalock. - Come down now, it's over, it's alright! - Leroy's dead. - No Mitzie. They took him to the hospital, he's alright. Now come on down off the ledge. You're gonna be free, don't worry about it! There's nothing to worry about, come on. Okay? Please? Come on. Everything's gonna be okay. You'll be freed. Really, there's nothing to worry about. Come on down, please? Come on. (gentle orchestral music) Please. Come on. (gentle orchestral music) - [Mitzie] Hey, you know what? - [Carrie] What? - [Mitzie] A girl could really get hurt up here. - [Carrie] Yeah, I know. ♫ Don't cry anymore ♫ There's nothing left to harm you ♫ Don't cry anymore ♫ You're gonna be alright ♫ You were just a frightened girl ♫ Caught up in a nightmare world ♫ Now the night is over ♫ Time to step into the light ♫ So please don't cry anymore ♫ You've got a friend beside you ♫ Don't cry anymore ♫ We're gonna see it through ♫ You've been running away much too long ♫ Yeah you haven't done anything wrong ♫ Dry your eyes ♫ Little girl ♫ Don't ♫ Cry
