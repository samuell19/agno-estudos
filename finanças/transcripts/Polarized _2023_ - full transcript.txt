You're kind, you know that? Just to try. Anyway, Agritech bought the farm. Yeah. I guess now they'll build warehouses on our crop fields. Don't worry about that now. Those people have no shame. ♪ (birds chirping) Ben: Can I get a couple days off? Lisa's dad passed. I want to help out, arranging the funeral and whatever. I'm so sorry to hear that. I thought maybe she told you. No. Please, tell Lisa that I'm sorry. Will do. Thanks. (Crow cawing) Thank you so much, both of you, for coming. (speaking indistinctly) Mrs. Fairwell, I'm so sorry for your loss. I'm going to ask you to leave now. I was just going to see Lisa. No need. I think you should stop hanging around my daughter. We're friends, Mrs. Fairwell. You have nothing in common with my girl. You leave her alone. Zein: There you are. You look like you need a drink. You have a hip flask hidden anywhere? It's only a matter of time. Mama's freaking out that you haven't been shopping yet, or booked a honeymoon, or had your legs waxed. My legs are fine. I figured. I made that last one up. If it's last-minute jitters, it'll pass, Dalia. Trust me. Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. You know what your problem is, right? You question everything. You always have. I love that about you, but sometimes-- What? Maybe you overthink stuff. - Hey. - Hey. You disappeared. What's up? Nothing. Are you having second thoughts? Omar. Hey, remember when we were 10 years old? New country, new school. I had the strongest Arab accent, I couldn't fit in. Both of us did. Yeah, but you never cared about what the other kids thought. I did. But you never needed them or anyone. I guess what I mean is... ...it would be great if you can think of nothing else but the wedding. And me. But I don't think that's who you are. That's what I love about you. Why don't we go out? Change of scene. Where to? Millie's fucking Diner? Watch your mouth! Or we could go for a drive. Wow, nightlife in Stonewall. Holy shit. (sighing) You know, there's a whole big world out there, Ben. You don't have to stay in this place your whole life. (dishes clattering) Give her time. She's just upset. No. No, I think it's something else. ♪ (singing in Arabic) ♪ Yeah, but you look so handsome. Thank you. (chuckling) Sayeed: Auntie, do you have a rose for me? You're married to my rose. Don't I know it. Wow. ♪ Do I look okay? Tarek: You look wonderful, both of you. ♪ Yalla, let's get you married. ♪ (cheering, applauding) ♪ Jill: The Lord's presence is with us. You're doing his work. There he is. We should get going. Joe: Well. Shall we have a talk? Lisa, your family and your friends, well... We're worried about you. We'd like to talk about certain feelings you've been having. Baby, this is for your own good. What is? You and Dalia are all over each other. You know what, Ben? You don't own me. Lis, come on. Casey, what are you doing? Look, let's just calm down. You're family. And when we see someone we love doing things that might hurt them, we need to intervene. Baby, baby. These urges that you're having, - you can get over them. - Don't touch me! Lisa, Lisa. Let me go. Let me go! Like the temptation to drink or do drugs, these-- these urges, they can be overcome. Think about it, Lisa. Why can only men and women procreate or be married in the eyes of the lord? Everything else is just desires of the flesh. Oh, my God. (breathing heavily) No! Let's pray. (grunting) Please, trust me. Trust in God. Dear Lord, give me the vision to see the path I should take to know that your guidance is always true. Amen. Casey, Ben and Jill: Amen. - (Lisa grunting) - Amen! Casey, Ben and Jill: Amen. Joe: Amen. Casey, Ben and Jill: Amen. Lisa, we can't change unless we admit there's a problem. Would you like to confess these feelings inside your body? These impulses? Fuck you. Fuck all of you. Lay her down. No. I'll get the holy water. Stop! We love you, Lisa. We love you and we are with the Lord. (breathing) (knocking) (lock jiggling) Jill: Baby? Open up. (lock jiggling) Baby, just come out so I can talk to you. Just let me talk to you.

Three months ago today we got married. Can you believe it? No, wow! Here's to three more years, and then to another 30. (glasses clinking) (phone ringing) Man: So, what kind of position are you looking for? Okay. (chuckling) I forgot the olives for your mom, for the pickles. We'll get 'em next time. Are you going to tell me what's going on? What do you mean? You've just been somewhere else the whole time. I don't know how to explain it. Hey, try. I love you, Omar. Since we were at school, I've loved you. But I think I love you like... What? Like my best friend. And I don't think that's enough for me, not for my whole life. Is there someone else? Nothing happened. Really, it's just... She's not even around anymore. She? Anymore? Are you kidding me? You said you felt something was off. Something, yes. This, no way! Are you kidding me, right now? Oh, my God. You're still in love with her. (engine starting) (sniffing) (beeping) $2.70. No, in fact, you owe me $133.12. And $2.70. Are you deaf? Or just a loser who can't pay for his Coke and gum? Hey! Hey, stop it! You have no idea what it's fucking like. Alright? You have no idea. I am from Palestine, then Syria. I have seen things you can't ever imagine. (laughing) The fuck is so funny, Nancy? I'm selling my TV. I got all the entertainment I need right here. (laughing) Come on. Come on, let's go. Stay out here, asshole. Shit. Piss off. I'm sorry. You could file a complaint if you want. His father died. He's lost his way. Kind of. (doorbells chiming) (panting) Is he pressing charges? You deserve it. What the fuck, Casey? I don't know, man. I don't know what-- I don't know what the fuck I'm doing anymore. I'm sorry for your loss. Really. Take this. Baklava, to your mother. For the funeral, your father. The funeral already happened. Take it. Take it. It's okay. Thank you. Kareem, or you can call me Abu Ali. The father of Ali. (phone ringing) (sighing) Oh, she's here. (clearing throat) Hey. Hi. Got your message. You have to make it work. I can't, Baba. Mama. You have to settle down, you have to have a baby. What about my happiness, Baba? What do you mean, habibti? What can make you happier than having a baby? Sayeed: Is this even about Omar? Stay out of this, Sayeed. Reem: Dalia! We saw you in the parking lot with that girl, Lisa. You obviously have feelings for her. There's something going on between you two. Nothing is going on. But, yes, I married Omar knowing I have feelings for Lisa. I don't understand. So, now you are gay? You know, there's nothing wrong with being gay, Sayeed. Look, I am getting a divorce and this family will not fall apart. You're only part of this family if you respect your husband. Okay? If you respect our honor. Baba, I tried with Omar. I can't stay in this marriage. Then you no longer belong here. Or at Agritech. Baba, you can't say that! No, no, no, no. What? Baba. Baba. Dalia! Sayeed: We need to talk. Yes, we do. Zein. Calm down, both of you. Dalia. Dalia, wait! Please! You shouldn't have married Omar knowing you felt for this girl. Poor man, you broke his heart. I know. Growing up, you and Zein always made fun of me because I nagged you to get married and have babies, and I wanted this for you because I love your father so much. I love being married to him. I love having you both and having my grandson. I just wanted this happiness for you, too. I know. Give your father time. Maybe he will come around. Mama, thank you. You see, you were wrong, you and Zein. It is not 1950, even in my house. ♪ (phone ringing) (sighing) What do you want? Mom needs your signature on the last papers for-- for Dad. Haven't you heard of email? Yeah, well the lawyer needs it in person. Certified or whatever. Um... Look, Lisa. I'm sorry about the intervention. I-I-- I never should have let that happen, and-- Tell her I'll come by tomorrow. Just to sign. ♪ (phone ringing) Lisa: Hello? Hey. I'm sorry I missed your call last night. Lisa: Oh. That's okay. How are you, Lisa? I'm fine. You? Fine. Listen, I interviewed for a job at Health World, and they won't hire me without a reference, so. Oh, okay. I know I quit on you, but I was-- Dalia: I don't care about that. I mean, I know why you quit, and Lisa, I need you to know I had no idea Sayeed would move in on buying a farm, especially your farm, that fast. I would never want to hurt you. Listen, if you could just leave it at reception, then I could come pick it up later. You're here? In Stonewall? Just today. Okay, but, um... About the letter, I actually can't give it to you at the office. It's just, um-- Okay, well. Just forget it then. (sighing) Who was that? Dalia. (scoffing, laughing) The nerve of her. Even after I told her to leave you alone. What? What do you mean, Mom? What do you mean, wh-- When did you see her? She showed up at your father's funeral. (scoffing) And I told her to stop sniffing around you. It is her influence that caused all this trouble. I am only ever trying to protect you, baby. That is-- That is all I'm ever trying to do. My whole life has been about you and Casey. Right? Lis. Right? (exhaling) (sighing) Dalia. I'm sorry I hung up on you, I just-- Here's the reference letter. You know, the Health World guy is saying that they're going to set up urban farms in the city. - Makes sense. - Yeah, yeah. I thought you might be interested, or your family. Anyway, I should go. Lisa. My family kicked me out of the business. And the house. Why, Dalia? I told them I married Omar knowing I was in love with somebody else. I've been so lost since you left. It was like I'd finally felt something that was real life, and then it was gone. You were gone. And I couldn't even get up in the morning. Yeah? I'm so sorry I pushed you away.
