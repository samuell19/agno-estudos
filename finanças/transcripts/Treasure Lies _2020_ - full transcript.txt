And the rest? - It's all in there. - How much? - 17.72. - With your discount? - Yup. - Where does it go? - That's okay. - I can get the rest to you on Friday. - I know where you live. (soft music) - Boo! - Go change, dinner's about ready. Go wake up your dad. (gentle music) - I'm starving. - Me, too. - So Becky got braces. She didn't hardly talk the whole day because she was paranoid. - You mean self-conscious? - That she is going to spit everywhere? - You're right, that's paranoid. (family laughs) - So Rob's gonna be selling his Jeep soon. I told him I want it. - This looks really good! - It doesn't have a lot of miles - Hey, can you pass the salt, please? But I love salt. - And I love you. - It doesn't have a lot of miles and it's the same engine as the old Cherokee, so if anything happens, you know how to work on it. - How much? - 3,000. Can I get it? - You know how we feel about that. - Nothing's gonna happen. - That's what Ryan thought. - He wasn't even driving. I can't ride my bike forever. (throat clearing) (door opening) - Why would you bring that up in front of your mom? You know I'm working on her. Just use my van for a little longer. - Like a girl would go out with me in that. - How are you gonna get the money? - I already have 1,700. - Your senior trip money? - I'd rather get a car than blow it on a trip to New York. - How much long until you have the rest? - Not long. I'll talk to Mr. Sherman about some extra hours. (car engine roars) - Everyday. - Drive. (upbeat music) - Hey, I know, why don't you just hit snooze one less time and then you'll have five minutes to stand around and think, "Tim's gonna be here in five minutes. "What am I forgetting?" - Or maybe you could actually brush your teeth in the morning and then that will give me the time that I need to get ready. - Ha. Funny. You wanna walk? - Guess what? - You outgrew your Teddy Bear P.J.'s? You love bubble baths. You keep your toe nail clippings in a jar. - I might be able to buy the Jeep. - Woo-hoo, you should buy this. - Dude, I can't afford this. - I can't stand it. - Why? - It was my Mom's car. - So? - So, it's literally a mom car. (upbeat rock music) - Out of your league. - I know. - But now dude, I'm serious, she's like big league and you're still hitting off a tee. She's stadium football and you're still playing in a hockey rink. She's like-- - Yeah, I got it. - Good 'cause I can't think of another one. - She's so good looking and doesn't even know it. - I wonder if I'm that way. How would I know? - Yeah. - I can hardly concentrate when I work with her. - Dude, her Dad could buy the whole town. Why does she even work there? - So she can be closer to me. - Yeah, I bet that's it. - No, no seriously, I've caught her looking at me a couple times in church. - To see if you're still staring at her. - Here she comes. - With your restraining order. (dreamy music) - See? - Oh, yeah. I could see it in her eyes. (loud thud) - You're in my way! - Dude, just change lockers. - He'll find me. - Well, do something. - I'm gonna start a fight with Wayne "The Pain". He's a Golden Gloves boxing champ. - When he was a feather weight. How tough do you have to be to beat up other feather weights? - Tough enough. (gentle music) I'm home. - Let's skip that one. We should have our tax refund by then. - We skipped it last month. - Okay, how about the gas bill? - [Mom] Really? - [Dad] Yes. It's warming up, spring is in the air. Flowers are blooming. Birds and bees are doing what birds and bees do. Speaking of birds and bees... (Mom giggles) - Still here. - [Mom] Are you here for dinner? - I gotta work. (Mom laughs) - Whoa, Dad! - Yeah. - [Dad] I love you. - Yeah, yeah. - Seriously? - Let me give you a little advise. Do you know when the best time to tell your wife you love her is? Before someone else does. (laughing) - I gotta go. - That's some good advice right there. - Mr. Sherman. - What's up? - Do you have a minute? - What's going on? - I wanna let you know that I'm not going on the Senior Trip, so I can work that week if you need me. - You're not? - No, and I'll take another eight hours a week, if you have 'em. - That seems like a lot with you still being in school. - I can handle it. - How about we start with fours hours a week for now and see how that works? - Thanks. - Hey. I don't want your grades slipping now. - They won't. - All right. - Sorry, Coach. - Does this have anything to do with your decision? - The money? No. - Look, I know your family's been through a lot. Okay, but you're the best second baseman we've got. All right, and if there's anything, anything I can do-- to get you back... - I've been trying hard for scholarships, it just doesn't look like one's gonna happen for baseball, so I gotta focus on my grades. (soft music) (banging) - Hey Peterson. Do we got a test today? (knuckles knocking) Are we allowed to use calculators? - Uh-huh. - Well, I forgot mine, give me yours. - Dude, come on, I need it for the test. (ominous music) (elbow thuds) - Are you sure I can't use yours? - It's the only one I have. - That's all I need. - Take it. Take it. - Good morning. Put your books underneath your desks and take out a pencil and a calculator and no cell phones. - Hey, what's wrong? - Oh, I don't know. I just blew a Trig test. - No, not Sean 4.0? - Wayne took my calculator. I had to do it old school. Do you have any idea how hard that is? - I do. That's why I don't take Trig. But man, you gotta stand up to him. - I'm a little smarter than that. I'm Sean 4.0, remember? (buses roaring) (announcement bell rings) - [Announcer] Attention, please. If you are going on the Senior Trip to New York, the buses have arrived. Please meet in the front of the building and we will be departing in 30 minutes. - Go.

If it was up to her, you wouldn't leave the house until you're 30. - I just wanna ask Melissa out before she goes to college and I never see her again. - Melissa Jacobsen? - Yeah. - Swinging for the fences, huh? - She's not gonna want to ride on my handlebars. (engine roars) (wipers swirling) - You can use this. - That's eight, nine, 10 and 20. - I only gave you 10. - Wow, thanks. - It's not mine. (Door Chimes) - Did you zero this out? - Yeah and we sold a ton today. - It's getting up there. - I should buy one. (chuckles) Yeah, like you need to win the lottery. - What time do you get off tonight? - Two. - I'd better get going there's a party at Mark Cleveland's. - I heard. - I wish you could be there. - Oh, yeah. I'd be the life of the party, sound asleep on the couch. - Maybe we could put a little lipstick on you, maybe some eyeliner. - I don't sleep that sound. - Later. - Later. (Door Chimes) - Hey Melissa, I have this crazy idea, let's go to prom together. How hard is that? - Very hard, if I remember correctly. - I didn't know you were standing there. - Most people don't talk to themselves when they know other people are around. (whispering) Makes 'em look crazy. So are you gonna ask her? - Oh, no. No, no, no. No. - Sometimes you just got to take a deep breath and let the question out. (car honks) She likes you. - Pfft. - Now, I've got five daughters. I fight off boys in my spare time. I can tell. (spray squirts) (Door Chimes) - (Indistinct chatter). - Hey Dude, you're missing a good party. - Oh, great, thanks. I thought I was missing a boring party. - What did Lacey want? - Licorice and a diet something. - I don't think so, she's a twig. I'm not getting her diet. - Hey, she won't drink it. - I'm not getting her diet. - Seany, you would not believe the girls at this party. - Who knows Brad, might even meet one. (laughs) - What? It could happen. - Melissa's there. Cooley's working her pretty hard. - Good luck with that. - It seems to be working.. Don't worry, bro. I got your back. (Door Chimes) 15.10. - Why don't you come by once you're off? - At two? - Another guy just decreases my odds. - And they're already a million to one. - That high, huh? What are we standing here for? Let's go. - See ya, Seany! - Later. - Yes, I believe in miracles. I put the cologne on. - Friends of yours? - [Sean] Yeah. - When do you get a chance to whoop it up? - I find time, I whoop. - You're working every time I come in here. - On my days off, I really tear it up. - I hope so, you need to enjoy your youth. It goes by too fast. - [Sean] Nothing. Another? - Please. - Do you want me to drop these off? - Bless your heart. - That'll be $19. - Keep the change. - Mrs. Wahl, like I tell you every time, I can't, but thank you. - Are you gonna make me walk to the Sooper Dooper? - You would never go there. - You don't think so? - They don't sell lottery tickets. Have a good night, Mrs. Wahl. (gentle music) (ominous music) Great. (Door Chimes) - Hey Peterson. How's my buddy? - So far so good. (box contents clatter) - You know you should really clean up this place up. It's kind of a mess. Keep the change. (Sean sighs) (upbeat music) - "Look at the birds of the air; "they do not sow or reap or store into barns, "but your heavenly Father feeds them. "Are you not much more valuable than they?" Do you know the difference between the birds and you? The birds are His creation, you are His children. God loves you so much more than any of His creation. But yet He feeds them everyday. Trust Him, He'll take care of your every need, not your every want (laughs) but your every need. - Oh. - Your girlfriend's coming up and down. (soft music) - Excuse me. Seriously? They can't let go just for a second? - I think it's kinda cute. Do you have work today? - No. - Wanna play tennis? - I'm horrible. - Perfect, then I'll kick your butt. (chuckles) I'll just have the go home and change first. Oh, and I have one more thing to do, then I'll be over. (lawn mower roars) (Mom laughs) How's it going? Thanks for inviting me to play tennis.

She was like folding laundry or something and there was this huge-- - Sword? - Yeah, yeah, there was a sword just right there in the dishwasher. No, it was a knife, but it looked like one to a 6-year-old. So I grabbed one and we went at it, like in the movies. - You're kidding me! - No. I cut his finger which really made him mad, and he lunged at me and I twisted and so instead of taking it in the chest... - Oh. It went all the way through? - Yeah, Ryan just let go and started screaming. Mom came out of the corner just in time to see me pull it out and down she goes. I had to call 911 myself. - That had to hurt. - Oh, it did. Bad. - That's the saddest funeral I've ever been to. - How's Brent doing? - He still has a limp but there's deeper scars. - He doesn't blame himself? - Well, he was driving. - Well, we don't blame him. You know that, right? - He blames himself. Mom blames Dad for buying him such a fast car and Dad despises her for it. Not that everything was all roses before then. Your folks were so strong through the whole thing. - They had some tough days. We all did. Still do. - They were rocks, and never lost their faith. I admire them so much for that. - [Mr. Jacobsen] Are you done? - Dad! - Hey, sweetie. - Does mom know you're here? - She can't keep me off my own court. - Let me go tell her before she freaks out. - What's he doing here? - Hi, Mr. Jacobsen. - Hey, look, so I gotta call it quits. - Wow, I really got a hold of that one. - Hitting it wasn't the problem. It was getting it into the square on the other side. - I think you gave me a bad racquet. Seriously, look at all the holes. (Melissa laughs) - So that's the excuse you're going with? - I think it's probably the most viable one. - Wow, viable? Fancy word. - I like to impress women by using fancy words. Periodically. - What is your dad doing on the tennis court? - Playing tennis. - Not on my tennis court, he isn't. - [Melissa] Mom. - I thought you didn't wanna live here anymore. - You kicked me out. - Mom, why can't he play? - Because it hurts too much to have him around. - Oh, just let me play with him. - One hour. - So, I gotta go. - Yeah, yeah, go. - I had fun. - Me, too. (gentle music) - What did he want? - To play tennis. - That's it? - We're just friends. - Did he talk about the accident? - Yeah. (ball rattles) - Did it seem like he was trying to pump you for information? - No, but it feels like you are. - This is serious. Your brother left us vulnerable here. And I don't like to be vulnerable. (exciting music) (gentle music) - What are you doing? - Making muffins. - Who are you and what have you done with my son? You feel all right? - Hahaha. It's a damaged box. We can't sell damaged boxes. - Mmm. You better get moving. Now, that's my boy. (students murmuring) - Bye. - Bye. - Good morning, Mr. Whitehead. (Tim laughs) - How is that funny? - It just is. - Guess what? - You sold your doll collection? You paint your toenails? You have softer hands than your mom? No dude - you actually do, that one was serious. Like a baby. - I already have 2,500 bucks. - Dude, sweet! He might have sold it. I'm not really sure. - You're kidding! You're kidding, right? - I'm not really sure. I'll call him tonight and get back to you. Do you work? - What do you think? (upbeat music) (sighs) Okay. You got this. You got this (Door Chimes) - Hi. - Hey. - Pump Seven. - Did the reader not work? - I wanted to come in and pay. Sorry about the mess the other day. - I didn't know your Dad moved out. - Not many people do. If you could keep that between us. - If you don't tell anyone how bad I am at tennis. (beeping) Your uh... card. I got it. Argh! - Ha, I got it. - No, no, I did it. - Seriously, I got it. - No, let me help. (soft romantic music) Do you wanna go to a movie sometime? - I don't think that's a good idea. - Oh. Okay. - Well, I gotta go. There's a wrestling match tonight. (suspenseful music) - There's a wrestling match tonight? (energetic rock music) - [Melissa] Yeah, against Central. Why? What's wrong? - Nothing. Nothing. (phone rings) I better get that. - Later. - TC Mart. - [Tim] Hey, Sean. - What's up? - [Tim] Nothing good. So I talked to my brother and he said he sold his Jeep to some guy in his frat. - I thought he was saving it for me? - [Tim] Yeah, so did I. His buddy wrecked his car and needed one right away. (somber music) You still there? - Yeah. - [Tim] Dude, I thought it was set in stone. Look, I'll take you to any car lot you want until you find another, all right? - Yeah, I gotta go. I have a customer. (jar shatters) Can something good happen to me? Just once. (Door Chimes) Hi, Mrs. Wahl. - Well, hello. Oh, no, what happened? - Butter fingers. Watch your step. (beeping) You want another? - Yes, please. - Would you like me to drop these off? - Yes, bless your heart. - That will be 12.75. - These are for you. I found a way. - You didn't have to do that, Mrs. Wahl. - Bye. (chuckles) (Door Chimes) (cheerful music) (intense music) (vigorous music) - Mrs. Wahl? Mrs. Wahl. (Door Chimes) (intense music) (Door Chimes) (Door Chimes) - I can't believe that you'd let me leave here without my lottery ticket. My lottery ticket. - Oh, yeah, sorry about that. - No problem. G'nite now. - G'nite. (Door Chimes) (suspenseful fast-paced music) (computer clicks) (gentle music) (Sean exhales) (suspenseful music) (cup shatters) (footsteps thumping) (Door Chimes) (intense music) - Whoa! There you are. - Oh hey. - I was getting worried I was gonna find a body back here. - Oh, no, just had to take out the trash. - I saw the broken glass and I started to freak out a bit. - Broken glass? - By the smell of things, it was pickles. - Oh, yeah, yeah it was. - And they say I'm not detective material. (both laugh) (phone shrills) - Hello. - [Mr. Sherman] Hey, Sean. Did I wake you up? - No, no, I've been up for a while. What's up? - [Mr. Sherman] Well, I've just got off the phone with Mrs. Wahl. (suspenseful music) - Oh, yeah. - [Mr. Sherman] Yup. - What'd she want? - [Mr. Sherman] She wanted to know if you dropped her groceries off because if you did, they're gone. - No, no, I forgot. - [Mr. Sherman] No problem. I could take them over to her. Where are they? - Where's my uniform? Right under the register. - Calm down, I put it in the wash. - You washed it? - I don't know, check the laundry. - [Mr. Sherman] Ah, yep, I see 'em. Sean? - Yeah. Thanks for doing that for me. - [Mr. Sherman] No problem, see you tonight. - See you tonight. (vibrant music) (Sean exhales) - [Radio Announcer] by the security company that had-- - What was that about? - Oh, I had a girl's number in my pocket. - She must be something special. - She is. - According to Lucky Break Lottery officials, the winner from last week's drawing still hasn't come forward. The winning ticket is worth an estimated $43 million. (sighs) - Do you have the money for the Jeep, yet? - He sold it on me. - I thought he was saving it for you. - So did I. - I'm so sorry. I know how bad you wanted it. - That was a good one too. Low miles, well maintained. - I know, right. (car honks) - What? What did you guys do? - What does it look like we did? We bought Rob's Jeep. - We didn't buy it, we're loaning you the rest of the money for now. - We had to act fast. We were afraid he was going to sell it before you could save enough. - So was I! (gentle music) - Every single time you turn this key, you're responsible for almost everything that's precious to me, you and my girls. Are you ready? - I am. - All right girls, who wants to ride in the Jeep? - I'll ride with Dad. - All right, Jenny, get in. - I am not going in that thing. - [Pam] Called it. - You knew about this? - Yeah, but I couldn't say anything. Oh dude, meet me in the parking lot, I gotta tell you something. - What is it? - It's that place where we leave our cars when we're in class. - Ha, ha! - Just hurry, okay. - Seat belts! (Jeep engine fires) (car popping) - [Sean] No. - All right, what'd you wanna talk about? - Dude, you haven't heard about the wrestling match last night? - What happened? - Only the funniest thing ever. So Wayne is all psyched up for his match, right. (crowd cheering) The freak is slapping his own face. The guy from Central is scared to death. I mean Wayne hasn't lost a match since sixth grade and this guy knows it. (Wayne's stomach grumbles) (crowd cheering) Wayne dives at this kid, gets behind him and gets some kind of idea that he's gonna lift him up and toss him back down on to the mat. (grunting) (Wayne farts) - [Crowd] Ooh! - [Wayne's Dad] What? Wayne! (Wayne farts) - [Student] What's going? - [Student] Oh No. (crowd laughs) - [Tim] And all of a sudden, waddles off the mat, straight to the locker room holding the back of his pants. - Wayne, where are you going? (crowd laughs) - [Tim] The guy from Central, he couldn't believe it. He won by forfeit. Dude, everybody was dying. (Tim laughs) (crowd laughs) - Wayne's looking for you. - Me? - Yeah. - Why? - I don't know. - Hey, ah, did he look mad? - He always looks mad. - Oh no, no, no, no, no! - What's wrong? - I kinda might've - made Wayne, forfeit. - How do you "kinda" make someone drop a load in front of the whole town? - Yeah, well, you told me to do something about it. - No, no, you're not blaming this on me. What did you do, Seany? - I made laxative muffins. - Laxative muffins! - But he took them from me. He stole them out of my backpack. I didn't make him eat them! - I'm sure that he'll take that into consideration while he's beating you half to death. - Dude, what am I gonna do? - I don't know. Cry. Bleed. Die. - Will you be serious? - Dude, he's a Golden Gloves champ. - Any ideas? - None that don't involve hospitalization. Wait! He would never expect you to throw the first punch. - Ya think? - No wait, I'm serious, dude. Look, I'll stand outside Mr. Hoffman's class and as soon as you land that first punch, I'll yell "fight" as loud as I can. You just need to hang in there until Mr. Hoffman can break it up. - That might work. - Dude, it's better than death. - I need Hoffman there right away. - Dude, I'll get him there. - Let's do this. (creepy music) (students chatter) - Protect your face. (suspenseful music) Where's Hoffman? (intense music) Are you kidding me? Sean! - You looking for me, Wayne? - Yeah, I've got something for you. - What's that? - You all right? - Yeah. (gentle music) - Hey, look. I just want to say I'm really sorry about this whole calculator thing and uh, everything else too, I suppose. We cool? - Yeah. - What just happened? - I have no idea. - Hey, look everyone it's Wayne "The Stain". (students laugh) (Sean nervous noise) - Wait, Sean. I was wondering if you still want to go see a movie sometime. - I do. - Good. You're bi-polar, right? I knew it. (Melissa laughs) - No, it's my Dad. - Doesn't he like me? - It's not that so much. (hems and haws) - But he's okay with us now? - My mom is. She said, "Let me worry about your Dad." - Yeah, what could go wrong with that plan? - So do you work Friday? - No. - So, Friday? - Sounds good. (gasping) (laughing) Call me crazy, but an idea just hit me. (laughs) Will you go to prom with me? - I'd love that. - Really? - Really. (laughs) - Guess what just happened? - You joined Golden Gloves Boxing? - Nope. - You sold your soul for a golden fiddle? - Nothing to do with gold. - You wrote a laxative cookbook? - Ha, funny guy. - Betty Crapper. (laughs) - What? - The name of your cookbook. Betty Crapper. Oh, no. From the Pot to the Pot. - Got any more. - Give me a sec. Dinner for Poo! (Tim laughs) - Now if you're done... - I am. Oh, no wait. No, that one's stupid. - Give it to me. - Salt and Pooper. Oh, oh, Eat and Runs. (laughs) - Okay, anyway, Melissa said she would go to prom with me. - Melissa Jacobsen? - Yup. - You're kidding me. - Nope. And we are going to a movie on Friday. - So you woke up this morning and you were gonna spend the rest of your life alone and now you're going to prom with Melissa Jacobsen? - Dude, I didn't ask her to marry me, I asked her to prom. - Dude! Are you getting a limo? She's gonna want a limo. - I didn't really think about it. - And you're probably going to have to take her somewhere expensive, like the Country Club. Oh and just so you know, if you're gonna rob a bank, your bright red Jeep sticks out like a sore thumb. - You can steal a candy bar. That's what my brother and I did when we were young. Yes, Pastor Brooks stole a candy bar. (laughing) We got away with it for a while and one day, baam. (yells) - [Youth] Woo! (Pastor laughs) - The manager grabbed us by the back of the neck. You know what he did? He didn't call the police, which he had all the right to. He asked us if we wanted him to call our father. There are forms of torture that I would prefer than disappoint my father. What I didn't realize was that I let him down just by stealing something. But what if we hadn't gotten caught? Who knows? I could have looked for something more thrilling to steal and before you know it, I'm getting fingerprint. Guys, don't fool yourselves. There are no small sins. They're all gateway sins that will wrestle for your soul unless you turn away from them.

(money shuffles) - Do you? - Right this way, Sir. - Is it possible to get the white sauce on the penne noodles? - For you, of course. - Thank you. - Well, he's sure coming on strong. - He's just being nice. - I think I know when a guy is flirting. - I think I do. - Like he has a shot with someone like you. - What does that mean? - I mean you with a waiter? - I've even been known to date lowly convenience store clerks. - I don't work there anymore. - What? - I quit. - Really? - I called Sherman and told him I wasn't coming back. - What about your shifts? - Let the rest of the schmucks fight over my hours. They can have them. Not you. I mean the guys that need the money. You obviously don't. You don't think I was calling you a schmuck, do you? - What? Do you think I get an allowance? Having a job makes me appreciate things. I manage my time better. I'm punctual, I'm more responsible. - You are oversensitive. Look, all I was saying is I just don't see you with a waiter. - You really don't get it. (knocking) - He's probably sleeping. - It's okay. I can get it. - Let him get it. It's his job. (banging) - I'm sorry. I didn't see you guys come out. - It's no problem. I could've gotten it. - He has one job. (upbeat dance music) ♪ No matter what comes our way ♪ ♪ My love for you will always remain ♪ ♪ (bouncy dance music) ♪ Nice suit, Wayne. Couldn't afford a tux? - All the black makes you look like a mortician. - Where's the funeral? - Yeah, at least all the black'll hide the stains, huh? (punch splashes) - [Crowd] Ahhh! - Did she just punch you in the face? - Where are you going? - What happened to the nice guy I used to work with? - Oh, now he opens the door! You're really gonna leave me, at prom? (suspenseful music) - I really don't know what's going on with you right now but I don't want any part of it. Slam it for effect. (door bangs) (quick footsteps thud) - (yells) Do you think I care? I can go in there and go out with any girl I want. (car engine roars) (tires squeal) Ryan? - What are you doing? Mom and Dad did not raise us act like that. - Yeah well, Mom and Dad wouldn't know what to do with this. - Look out! - What? (punch smashes) (Sean gasps) (running footsteps thudding) (gentle music) - What's wrong with that boy? I love you, Mom. - And your Jeep, evidently. - I do. I love that thing. And I hope you and Dad know I appreciate everything you do for me. - We do. Can I get you to do something for me? - Anything. - Brush your teeth. - Ha. Ha. Ha. (Mom laughs) (students chatting) - Thanks, Peterson. - We need to think of a color theme. - Is that a thing? - Yes. Your tux and my dress have to match. - I've been thinking that maybe you should go with someone else. I'm not gonna be able to get a tux, or a limo or take you anywhere nice. - Well, if that's what you think's important to me, maybe I should. - Wait. - No, we're gonna go to Prom together. And we'll take your Jeep and eat at The Lokal and you can wear one of your dad's suits. I don't care. We're gonna have fun. - I have a suit. - What color? - Navy. - Do you have a blue tie? Now we're getting somewhere. (upbeat music) - What's wrong with that boy? - So when are you coming home? - Why won't you ask your mom. - We have. - Well, what'd she saying? - "When he loves me more than he does his stuff?" - That's ridiculous. - Is it? When you got to the hospital, the first thing you did was yell at Brent for totalling his car. - That was a 75 thousand-dollar car. - Ryan died. - I didn't know that at the time. - You knew Brent's leg was messed up. - I know I overreacted. But hasn't your mom overreacted, too? I've been kicked out of my own house. - And out of the lives of your children? - Of course, I miss, miss you. Is that Sean's Dad? - Yeah. - Why's he meeting a lawyer? - How would I know? - I wonder what they're talking about. - Do you remember what we're talking about? - I do. We were about to order dessert. - [TV] Why aren't you out saying goodbye to your friends. - [TV] The time with my Mom was cut short by a week. - Hey, Mom. - Hey. - Would you eat Rice Krispy bars made out of Cap'n Crunch? - Rice Krispy bars made out of Cap'n Crunch? - Yeah. - Sure. - That's what I thought. - What if you never had to do this again? - Clip coupons? - Yeah. - I love clipping coupons. - Seriously? - It's like a game. When I go to the checkout and say the total's like $100 and then I give them the coupons and now it's 90. It's like I just won $10. - But wouldn't it be nice to not have to do it? - I don't have to do it. I want to. - Let's just say Dad made a ton of money. - Like if he were a district manager? - Like he owned the company. - Oh, okay, we're loaded. Got it. - Would you still clip coupons? - Yeah. - But you have all of this money. - Why leave 10 bucks at the store? - Imagine if he had that kinda money when you met him, how different life would be. - I probably wouldn't have liked him. - If he was filthy rich? - I like him the way he is. - Wouldn't you love him more if he were rich? - It's like this cake mix. If you put in just the right amount, you get a cake. - But if you forget an ingredient or you use twice the amount of something, it's just not the same cake. I like your dad just how he is. - Isn't the money just icing on the cake? - You can put icing on a brick, baby, that doesn't make it a cake. (Jeep roars) - Oh, boy! - What are your intentions? - Honestly, sir, we are just friends. - I mean you and your dad. I saw him the other day with Jeff Seeley. - They're in a Bible study together. I think Dad's like a mentor or something to him. - Hey, sweetie. When can I expect you? - I'll bring her by in the morning. - We agreed I'd have the kids this weekend! - Why would you want her to come over there so late? - We talked about this. - 11? Is 11 okay? - Yeah. - Bye, Bethany. - They only do that when I'm around, right? [Sean] Yeah, the special effects were great. - [Melissa] I know and I love it when they end a movie like that. - [Sean] Yeah - you're like, "What just happened?" - Like me in my driveway, what is happening? - So you think they will go through with it? - I don't know. It was supposed to be a trial separation but they keep getting more and more separate. I miss our simpler life. - When was that? - When we lived on Meadowlark. - You lived on Meadowlark? - Out past the dump? - Yah. - Huh. - They were actually happy back then. We had a little bitty house. We didn't have any money. It was so much fun. - What changed? - I don't know. Dad started the company and, he worked every night and weekend. He quit going to church and as the company grew, they drifted apart. It's like all he cared about. I can't remember the last time I heard them say, "I love you" or saw them kiss. That's what I want when I get married. - Someone that'll kiss you? - A strong, caring Christian who's not afraid to show affection. Like your Dad. - (laughs) You know he's taken, right? - Like your Dad is with your Mom. Sometimes, in church, I'll turn around to look how close they are and wish my parents were that close. They seem so happy. - I thought you were looking at me. - Maybe I was. - They're practically glued together. - I'd do anything to glue my parents back together. (knocking) - Come in. - Hey, dinner's almost ready. Time to wash up. - Hey, Dad? - Yeah. - Do you have a minute? - Is this a door open or door closed minute? - Open's fine. - All right. What's up? - Nothing really, but I have this friend who did something that he feels real bad about and he doesn't know what to do. - What's the Bible say? First John? "If we confess our sins, "He is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins "and purify us from all unrighteousness." - I thought my sins were forgiven just for asking. - They are but confessing helps us deal with the guilt of our sin. Okay. We all sin, right? But when we don't confess our sins to God, they're like building blocks. We keep building and building a wall that separates us from God. It's like us. You're my child and you know I'll love you no matter what. But our relationship is always better when we are communicating, right. There's always apologies, restitution and there's always, always repentance, turning away from your sins. Is there still time to fix this situation or whatever? - Yeah, kinda. - And that'll correct things and make things right? - Yeah. - Then I think you answered your own question. (blow whooshes) My work here is done. - Thanks, Dad. (Dad chuckles) - What? - Just wondering what your closed door conversations look like. Come on, wash up. (knocking) (door bell rings) (phone buzzes) (knocking) (clicking) - Oh, that's so pretty. - Oh, you guys! - You're perfect, I love it. You look so great. - Oh, right here, right here. - Melissa - Yeah, you are so beautiful. - You are so beautiful. I love it. - Nice. (laughs) - That is so cute. - Okay, hang on, hang on. - That's great. Let me get a few. - Mom can send you copies. - Just a couple, just to play it safe, okay? Come on, let's get in there.

I had a lot of fun. - Me too. - I'm not gonna turn into a pumpkin or anything. I better get in there. - Please do. I don't want her coming out with a shotgun. - She wouldn't hurt you. She likes you. Almost as much as her daughter does. She says, "There's a lot of good in that young man." And I agree with her. (gentle music) (Jeep roars) (footsteps thud) - What happened? - They think it was a heart attack in her sleep. One of her sisters called us when she didn't return her call. You gonna be okay? (ambulance engine roaring) (somber music) - Into thy hands, Oh Lord, we commend the body and the spirit of Agnes Suzanna Wahl. Born in the image of God and now she walks with the Father and the Son. May we all lead our lives so that we may walk together with them. Amen. Go in peace and serve the Lord. (somber music) - You're right in here. - Thank you. - Hello Sean. - Hi. I wanted to-- - Sean, this is our In-House Counsel, Terri Nelson. I've asked her to sit in on this meeting. - Okay? - What brings you in? - I wanted to give you this. - You can't serve papers on Mr. Jacobsen. It has to be done by a disinterested third party. - I can't give him this? - It absolves you, Brent, your family, - What? - The company of all responsibility in the accident. - It was an accident. We don't want you to worry that we're gonna sue you. - Both parents signed. - If you had been at the funeral, you would have known that we've forgiven Brent. Getting over losing Ryan has been hard. Forgiving Brent wasn't. We don't blame either of you. (gentle music) You know, the hardest part about forgiveness isn't the forgiving. It's accepting that you're forgiven. (gentle music) (door bell rings) - Let's go. Let's go, man! Come on that's not a hit. Hit! You got to hit, let's go. Come on, come on, let's go. Hit me. (boxing gloves thud) Come on. That wasn't a hit man, hit me. Last warning. (boxing gloves thudding) (Wayne groans and coughs) - You're so worried about that pretty little face. You leave your gut wide open. It looks like you got company, Nancy. (groaning) - What are you doing here? - Can I talk to you for a minute? - Sure. - You might wanna leave those on. (exhaling) - What do you want? - You know those muffins? - Yeah? (students murmuring) - He found out about the muffins? - He did. - Hey, I didn't tell a soul! - I told him. - Are you nuts? - Possibly. - What did he do? Well, what'd you think he was gonna do? (Sean groans) - Well, what'd you think I was gonna do? - I didn't think you were gonna hit me. - Yeah well, it was an automatic thing. Sorry. - I probably deserved it. - Probably? - All right, I deserved it. - I guess I probably deserved what you did to me, too. - Really? - Don't expect me to thank you it. - I'm just surprised to hear you say it. - Yeah, yeah. No, oh, this is perfect. This is perfect, okay. You are going to go to school, right, tell everyone that this whole wrestling incident, it was your fault, all right? You were playing some kind of practical joke on me and it backfired. (Sean laughs) - Backfired? - You think this is funny, Peterson? - Sorry, go on. - And so I found out about this and I kicked your butt. - Are you sure you wanna keep being known as a bully? - You know this one last time, maybe I do. - Can we just say I got a few hits in? - No one would... - ...believe that. - You should have had him keep his gloves on. - I tried! - Can you tell me why there's a lawyer down at the store looking for you? - A lawyer? - I just got off the phone with Mr. Sherman. Is there anything you need to tell us? - Not really. - Is it about a ticket? - Ticket? What ticket? - Did you get a speeding ticket? - No. No. - Anything to do with that black eye? - I don't think so. - Call him and find out what he wants and then call me. - I'll call him when I get to school. - And then? - I'll call you. Hi, is Kenneth Smith there? Okay. Will he be back today? Okay, no, I'll try again later. All right. Okay, thanks. (suspenseful music) (students murmuring) - Hey, look everybody, it's Stain. Stain, Stain. - [Crowd] Stain, Stain, Stain, Stain, Stain, Stain, Stain, Stain, Stain, Stain. - Stain! - Leave him alone! You've all heard the rumors. Okay, you know this was my fault. So stop picking on him? Leave him alone! - That's him right there, actually. - Which one? - That one. - I need to ask you a few questions. - Do you work at... - He took them out of my backpack. - The TC Mart? What? - Nothing. Go on. - Do you know a Mrs. Agnes Wahl? - Mrs. Wahl? - Mrs. Agnes Susanna Wahl of 208 Nellie Street? - Yeah. - Are you the only Sean that works at the TC Mart on Junction Avenue? - Yes. - I need to read you something. - "I would like to leave," - I can explain. - "20% of my savings to Sean" - What? - "The young man who works "at the TC Mart on Junction Avenue. "For years, he has carried my groceries home from the store "and never asked for anything in return. "He's such a hard worker. "It seems like every time I go there, he's working. "I wanna make sure he has enough money to go to college." She got $100,000 when her husband died. She put it away and didn't touch it. She doesn't have any children so she left 40% to each of her sisters and the rest she is putting in a trust for you to be able to go to college. With interest, that's $41,578.56. (Sean exhales) Please sign here. Are you 18? - Yeah. - Right here. (gentle music) And here, that's your copy. You take that one. Her sisters tell me that she spoke very highly of you. - I thought a lot of her, too. I really did. (gentle music) - Stay out of the cookie jar. You were supposed to call me today. - Was I? - You were gonna call me and tell me what the lawyer wanted. - Oh, that's right. - So what did he want? - He just wanted me to sign some papers. - I hope you didn't sign anything without your dad or me reading them first. - I thought you would approve. Mrs. Wahl left me $41,000 to go to college. - She did not! - I take out 20% each year for four years and the balance when I'm 25. - Shut up! - I don't think I deserve it. - You were always so nice to her. This is her way of showing you her appreciation. - Just don't make a big deal about it. - So, no parade? - [Sean] No parade. ♪ Change my heart ♪ ♪ Save my soul ♪ ♪ Shower me with love ♪ ♪ I've never known ♪ ♪ Let my life, reflect your Name ♪ ♪ Let everything within me bring you praise ♪ ♪ Let everything within me bring you praise ♪ (congregation applauds) - Last weekend, I went to my niece's birthday party. And my sister takes 27 eight year-olds bowling. Yay! (laughing) Eight-year olds. They don't bowl like we do. They have these bumpers that pop up. I tell you, I don't think any of them were trying. They were throwing the ball and hitting the bumpers on purpose. But the bumpers aren't there to be a part of the game. The bumpers are there to get you turned around, back on the right track, on the right path, so that eventually, you're really bowling. Right there, right down the middle. As Christians, God has given us these bumpers to walk with him. One of them is this phenomenal thing called Grace, that is greater than our sin. And Grace has a way of getting into the gutter, of our lives to get you turned around on the right path. And the other one that He gives us is Scripture. Scripture tells us what to do, and how to do it. It teaches us in the way we should go, it trains us in the who that we should be. Because, friends, God never intended for us to bounce from bumper to bumper, or skim down the edge, flirting with sin. He's called us to so much more than that. We were told in Hebrews to cast aside every weight, every sin, everything that distracts us, and fix ourselves on Jesus. See? Jesus, He is that headpin. He's what we are aiming for and the more we aim at Him, the more our lives are on track with all that God has for us. That's when we begin to do the right thing, consistently. That's when we begin to forgive, to humble ourselves, to submit. That's when we become men and women. That store up treasures in heaven, not things of this world, and actually live lives of significance, of substance, of character. That's what it was meant to be. Right there. Straight down the middle. (bowling ball and pins) (congregation laughs) (student's murmuring) - So you wanna come over and play tennis? - Yeah. I have some stuff I have to do first but I'll hurry. - Okay. Ah, thank you, kind sir. (laughs) - I don't really know how to begin. Right before Mrs. Wahl died, she came into my store and bought a lottery ticket and had me check the old one. I threw it away like I always do but after she left, I noticed it was a winner. I took it out of the garbage and I ran after her but something stopped me. I don't know what it was. I'm not that kind of person. I've had time to think and pray about it and I felt guilty about it the second I took it. I think that was God's way of telling me, "You know what you did wrong." Well, anyway, it's not mine. It never was. Will you see to it that it gets to her sisters and apologize for me? - I will. Thank you for doing this. I commend you for your honesty. - Don't. I don't deserve it. Right. (laughing) (gentle music) I tried to give it back to her. I went by her house the day before she died but she didn't answer the door. By the time I went back, it was too late. I really did try. (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (computer keypads clicking) - Come on, Come on. Come on, come on, come on!
