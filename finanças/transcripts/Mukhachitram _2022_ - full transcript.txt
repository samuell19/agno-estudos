Ma'am is here already. Sir, you need to get here soon. Ok. Good morning ma'am. Sir will be here soon. He's on the way. Ma'am... All the best. [Singing a song] Good morning sir... - Hmm What's happening inside? You remember that silly case? That frustrated woman who slapped her husband! That and a couple of other cases. Wow. That case is still open? That couple is desperate to get separated. What can we do? People get divorced for the silliest of reasons nowadays. - [Horn blares] He has a case today? What cigarettes do you want? Kings! 'To find out what happens next,' 'You must learn about what happened before this!' The 2 of them, 'Were 3, an year ago.' 'Let me introduce those 3!' [Applause] Hi. My name is Dr. Rajkumar. And I'm a plastic surgeon. [Phone vibrating] You may have seen this in several movies... A lead characters face is replaced. Yes. I've been trying to reach Dr. Rajkumar. He's not lifting the call. What's the matter? We're all setup and the patient is prepped. Waiting for sir to come and start the procedure. Raj is giving a TED talk. We should be there in 30 minutes. I'm here to talk about... WHY?! "Why I became a plastic surgeon?" Let me tell you a short story. Yamini Reddy. One of India's top models in the 90s. She was married to a renowned businessman from Andhra. Mr. Gangadhar. One bloody accident! Changed everything. Yamini's face was badly deformed. She was a model. She was beauty conscious. She couldn't bear to look at her face like that. That drove her into depression. Two years later, She left this world. This is Yamini Reddy. And she's my mother. We... Cannot do anything about accidents, But... If we try hard. We can control incidents like these! And that's what brought me here. And remember one thing. Not everybody who wears an apron is a doctor. Thank you. I like your voice! Hey! Thank you so much. Credit goes to my dad! He has a wonderful voice. One last thing. What we get by birth, is not worth celebrating. Whatever we earn in this life, Celebrate only that. See you. Signing off. [Applause] [Ambulance siren wails] [Man crying] Hi sir. Help me. Actually, he's been badly hurt. I don't know what to do. He's losing a lot of blood! - Cool. Cool. Cool. Maya cool. Raj?! Hi! Oh my god! I can't believe this. How are you? This is Satya! - Hi! Our classmate... - Hi! - Hi! Oh my god! Long time. What happened? Actually, the thing is, Trinetra? - Yes sir. It means the Third eye. It's a thriller. Interesting. I wrote a weekly blog for romantic stories. This is my first crime thriller. Turning this into a movie is my dream. Can you explain it briefly? Sure. Finally, thanks to the CCTV evidence, Police manage to arrest the bad guy. Fantastic. That's cool. Thank you sir. Have your ice cream. - Sure. Let's close this deal by evening. I want to buy this story. How about 10 lakhs? Thank you so much sir. Means a lot. Seriously means a lot. Yes. We need to travel together. [Chuckles] So, how about going to Goa? Why Goa? Hey come on. I told you we need to travel. And did you think I was paying you 10 just for the story? Ouch! Who even gives a fork for ice cream? Maybe they were out of spoons. Hang on, The guy in the visual and the guy on the stretcher look different. Wig? I thought it was her hand bag Doctor Bro! Same here. - You got smokes? Where do we smoke? So Maya, you're not married? Nah! Waiting for the perfect match. Still? You're almost 30. Get married soon. Hello. I'm not in any hurry. - [Phone chimes] Need to find someone who can tolerate me too. You've become way too violent. Come on Satya! You still think there are any soft spoken women left today? Impossible! [Gate creaks] Bye Grandpa! Bye Grandpa! Bye. Bye! You were smoking? Umm... no! You can't get rid of cigarette smell just by chewing some betel leaves. You also need to clean your hands with some neem leaves. When will you change? Take your medicine. You've become way too smart. Why would I kiss your hand soon as you come home? You're not some mafia boss. Fine. I'll quit soon. Medicines. Now. [Gate creaks] He's here. Even at this hour? Your work doesn't stop at this hour. Why should mine? Welcome Murthy. Come. Namaste sir. - Sit down. Listen man. How many times do I have to tell you? I asked you to drop a text before coming home. But I did send a text. I got only a single tick. Check it once. These damn signals I say... Yes. I got it. - You did? Now open it. Photo number 3. Boy's name is Ravishankar. He works in L&amp;T Bengaluru. He recently married off both his elder sisters. Without borrowing a single penny. And dowry? He's in demand. So he wants 50. But we can bargain him down to 40. Easily. I mean... One guy wants dowry to turn his shop into a supermarket. Another guy is looking for business capital. And a guy trying to recover money spent on his sisters. What are you doing uncle? Fine. Let it be. Let's search for better matches Murthy. Yes. We will. 'Ironic.' 'They are still searching,' 'but our man is already rushing towards them.' 'This story began on' 'March 1, 2020.' - [Whistles] The point of matchmaking is, it's all planned. This is a first. Even the poor matchmaker is going to be shocked. He shocked us into coming here from Bengaluru. Add it to the list. No it's not that. I have love at first photo! I couldn't help it. This is the first time I've actually come to Vijayawada. If everything goes smoothly, I'll show you around. The street food here is just delicious! My dear brother seems to have done his research. Come on. Let's fix this one. [Laughs] - Oh no! Even rolling a 6 is useless. Why is he here? Roll the dice. What is the matter Murthy? Just give me a minute sir. Oh no no no... Sir! Sir! Hello! Namaste! Namaste sir. - Namaste. My name is Rajashekhar. Why should I? I think I see it. Rajkumar. - Namaste. I wish to speak with you. Why did you send us the photos? What actually happened was, those photos got sent to all my contacts by mistake. How can you be so irresponsible with that information? Madam, please don't make it an issue here. I'll call you in the evening. Let this match proceed smoothly. We'll decide what to do about you later. Madam... Phone...! Oh no! I'm reminded of my school days suddenly. Even our library used to be so quiet. And all of us, used to crack our knuckles for the sound. Nostalgia. If you don't mind, can I ask you something? Nice tea. What brand? 3 roses. Good. Can I ask another question? How many guys have had this 3 roses till now? I mean... How many other grooms have you meet? This is the first time. We've started looking only recently. Not really impressed with the matches coming our way. May I ask why? Just out of curiosity. Everybody is focused on dowry. Most people are only focused on, how much we can give and what they can do with that money. Hardly anyone is bothered about how I feel! That's why, None of them ever came home. It was all just on WhatsApp. Silly fellows. Their greed for dowry [Sighs] made them miss this amazing tea. I feel like I'm the only one talking. Let me come to the point. They say that sometimes, even the wrong directions, Can lead us to the right paths. That's what happened now. "Who is this idiot? Some Doctor from Hyderabad." "And now this idiot wants to marry me." You may be thinking all that. Nothing like that. Can I tell you something? I mean, please don't judge me. I got your photos just 2 days back. I came here to Vijayawada immediately. I was observing you from afar. I was roaming like a roadside romeo. I wanted to come talk to you directly. But... I was afraid I'd scare you off. Can I ask you something? God! At last! Of course you can! How did you like me in just two days? Good question. 'Face is the index of the mind.' I'm a firm believer of that. I felt like I knew you the moment I saw your photo. My judgment is never wrong Mahathi. In case I was wrong, I wanted to at least come and silently see you before I decided. But I'm not wrong. I don't know what to say to that. No worries. Take your own time. What are you looking for? Any chance I can find a flower...? I want to propose to you. That's a neem tree. Of course it is. I will take great care of you. I won't even eat Non-veg at home. And when we go out together, Palak Paneer. Even after working out, I will drink only protein shakes. There will be no eggs at our house. One second. I arranged this marriage to the woman I loved. Not one, Not two, Three roses. For the most beautiful lady. Thank god! My brother's flight tickets didn't go waste. [Laughs] What did you say to her upstairs? What did you say to him downstairs? [Laughs] [Cell phone rings] Hello. Sir sir... Namaste sir. Murthy bro namaste. I'm not used to this WhatsApp thingy. I accidentally forwarded that girl's photo. Please forgive me. Murthy bro, you did me a solid favor. Thank you so much. You're too kind. Sastry sir really liked your family. They asked for your horoscope. Could you please forward it to me. Done Murthy bro. Superb. I'll be in touch. [Music] [Whistles] Satya! Oh my god! You're a cutie. Happy birthday! Thank you Satya! This is Sruthi. My best friend. - Hi. My blood friend. Hey. Where's your blood friend? He's in Vijayawada. To see this girl he wants to marry. He'll be back tomorrow morning. Slow down you! What's the rush? Hello. I've been drinking since 5 years. You don't need to teach me anything. I didn't know even addictions had principles. Satya! Mind your words. Hello! I've been talking since 30 years. You don't need to teach me anything. [Laughs] Sorry. Why do you look so glum on your birthday? No no. I'm happy. It's here. Thank you. Thank you. Here. This is Mahathi. Yesterday she was Raj's crush. Today she's his fiancÃ©e. She looks good right? Like my face. Oh come on. Look at how cute she is. She takes tuition up to class 6. Raj is a lucky man. He got a good woman. Satya! Stop it will you? You're driving me crazy. Why are you so jealous? They say a woman is a woman's worst enemy. Must be true. It is. F*** it! Let's simply party on. Come on. Cheers everyone. Cheers! Happy birthday. - Happy birthday to me. You're great Maya. On your birthday, you find out that lover's getting married... Yet you're so calm... Hats off dude! Love? Maya? Haven't you moved on? [Music] "Wherever you go..." "That's where I'll be too..." "That's how much I adore you..." "Everyplace you go..." "I'll stay stuck to you..." "Staying away from you is oh so hard!" "Wherever you go..." "That's where I'll be too..." "That's how much I adore you!" "Everywhere you go..." "I'll stay stuck to you." "I can't bear to stay away from you." "Maths is full of your gossip" "Science is filled with thoughts of you." "With Love, I dream only of you..." "No room in my head for any lessons." "All I'm doing is just reading YOU!" "Just us, in the Classroom!" "Just us, in the corridor!" "Just us, playfully together!" "Just us, everywhere together!" "Just us, together in the lunch break." "Just us, in the last bench!" "Just us, on the blackboard..." "Just us, our hearts united!" "Wherever you go..." "That's where I'll be too." "That's how much I adore you" "Everywhere you go..." "I'll stick on to you..." "I can't bear to stay away from you!" 10 years later, We'll probably be married! We can, after we sort out our careers! What do you want to be when you grow up? This is not grown up enough? I mean after you become an adult! In the half yearly exams, I scored 47.5 out of 50. I want to become a doctor. You got it just this once. I never get less than 48 in English. I want to become a teacher. See that's career planning! Really? It's time for school. Let's go. Let's stay a little bit longer... I'll come see you at your hostel tonight. [Music] "No matter how much time I spend with you," "I still feel like I want a lot more..." "We're together at school all day..." "I'll still come running for you, anytime..." "I keep going mad for you all day..." "It's nowhere near enough..." "I'm totally transforming myself..." "Changing wholly for you..." "My deepest secrets and feelings..." "And all the sweet nothings I swear by..." "I whisper to you till the crack of dawn." "Oh this love takes up all my time..." "Us together in the classroom - Us together in the classroom!" "Just us, together in the corridor - Just us, together in the corridor!" "Just us, playfully together!" "Just us, together everywhere!" "Just us, together in the lunch break!" "Just us, together in the last bench!" "Just us, together on the blackboard!" "Just us, our hearts united!" "Wherever you go..." "That's where I'll be too..." "That's how much I adore you..." "Wherever you go, I'll stick to you..." "Oh I can't bear to stay away from you." Sorry Maya. I assumed you were easy going. Why? Because of these? Hmm... OK. Come on Maya... That wasn't what I meant! Do all childhood fantasies ever work out? You wanted to become a teacher. Did you? No! This is just like that. Stop it OK! I'm definitely not going to be a silly 6th class tuition teacher! 3 roses it seems... That's a proposal? He was following her around for two days? That's called stalking! Yes. That's true. Wow! That idiot girl thought that was romantic! One complaint and he'll be locked up for 3 years. I've studied law too. Brother! How are you? Oh he's fine, no doubt! Whatever! Durga my dear, when did you come? Don't talk! I'm ashamed to call you my brother! What's bugging you? I wanted to dress up royally for my son's wedding! Look now! I'm tying up garlands! Why isn't your daughter marrying my son? Who's stopping you from dressing up now? This was a good match. Very good match? And we aren't a good match? My son is a respectable employee. That too in Hyderabad! You really never cared for this sister. Durga, It's not like that. - I said don't talk to me. Just don't! Job and all is good. Did you inquire about other things? What is the boy like? Who are his friends? Does he have any habits or addictions? Durga! Let it rest will you? The wedding's in 2 days and you're throwing tantrums? Moreover, Cousins marrying isn't a good idea. [Door bell rings] [Door bell rings] Hello. Coffee? - Obviously. 2 minutes. - Thank you. [Clears throat] Check this. I found your place without bugging you too many times. Wow. Did I wake you up? Wow, how did you know? I can read your face. I can tell just like that. What a wow! Proud of you. I have good news! Oh really! Tell me. So one week back... One second. What was that in your hand? I forgot. I'm trying to share my happiness with you. 21 year old whiskey. Exclusively for you. And yeah, I'm getting married. So now there's a tradition of gifting booze with wedding invitations? No no! This is for you. Because you like it. You can happily get sloshed. What happened? What happened? Get the hell away from me! What happened Maya? I like to booze? Is that all I like? You should have brought along a carton of cigarettes. I would have sat the night and finished them. Sorry. Locking myself up in a room all night and smoking, doesn't spark any realization like in the movies. I will die. And that will be the end of it. What are you saying Maya? Just stop! Just get lost from here! Tell me your problem clearly. I love you man. I love you. Why the f*** would I celebrate if you're getting married? Maya, I thought it was just infatuation. Maybe for you! Certainly not for me! I never moved on! All these days I assumed you were still back in the US. I was shocked seeing you at the hospital that day... I've written 14 love stories till now. I imagine us in every one of those couples! Every protagonist of mine is named either Raj or Kumar! You would know if you had ever bothered to read! Cool Maya, Cool! Don't scream! Your neighbours might listen! What the... Even now you're worried about the neighbours! You never cared for me! [Crying] I'm extremely sorry Maya! Come... You know what, forget it. I was just a little emotional. Nice card. Give it to me. I'll be there. Now go! Actually, Maya... Really. Go. I said I will come! OK. Take that bottle with you. I'm quitting smoking and drinking! What's all this about? [Chuckles] You won't get it. When a guy fails in love, he can happily grow a beard. I'm a bloody writer OK. I have to try something new. That's why... Now go. Take the bottle and go! [Snaps finger] Wish you married life. Happy... You won't be. Get lost. Call up Sai and find out who's the judge assigned to us. Here you go sir. Sir, I've heard about Vashishta. So that's him? Yes. Normally people argue with the opposing lawyer. This man makes them cry. He uses sarcasm, wit and his sharp tongue he embarrasses them in front of everyone. He made two female lawyers cry in court. Really? If you let him, he will even hoodwink the judge. All of us fondly call him the 'Mighty elephant'. Sir, I want to go inside and watch his arguments. There's no need. Once he starts you can hear his voice even from here! What? He wasn't named Elephant because of his size. It was because of his voice. You can even hear him clearly two streets away. Happy Anniversary! What are you doing here? What's the occasion? This is your 50th case, right? I'm here to applaud your win. Oh really? You think you can lie to me now? No way. Tell me the truth. I'm sure you're going to make some excuse in the evening. I'm here to take you home with me right after you're done with court. You're not ditching me on our anniversary. That's why I've brought you lunch. You planned this out all right... Anyway, You remember my friend Gangadhar? He was at our wedding... The one who moved to the US? I'm defending his son today. Why? What happened? Doctor Bro. You should have given your 10th standard photos. Why bro? You would have looked much younger in those. Bad one. Let's go. [Music] "The wedding ritual united them" "The Vedas taught them the secret of marriage" "The wedding trumpets sang for them" "God painted a perfect picture" We were just a little late, All sweets are over. I don't know... - What's here to eat? Eat something. Listen boy. - Huh? Does your friend know how to cook? Of course. Whenever he boils some water, you'll lose one of your fingers! Wow! So he's a proper chef? Anyway, are you married? Let's avoid my marriage topic. Once I start that narration, it'll turn into a web series. What are you doing dear girl? No! Don't use your left hand! Stop that! Stop it. Who eats with their left hand? What are you eating anyway? Girls your age should eat better! You! Bring the lentils here! Come here. Kids your age need to eat properly! Mix this in nicely, Serve me some more. Here! Look, you mix in the lentils this way, And take big morsels, Like this, come on! Do you know how we enjoyed food at your age? Lean forward. There you go! You want pickles? The two people who hated this wedding! Look how quickly they bonded! So that's how you use this camera?! Maya, are you alright? I'm jealous of her man! Why? Because of Raj? No. Because she has a family. [Crying] [Car alarm chirps] [Music] "I wonder how I got so lucky" "When I behold the treasure I found..." "My priority is always you" "Oh how can I ever stay apart from you!" "Like the clouds that hide moisture," "Like the sky that holds clouds," "We need to be one mind, body and soul," "So let me hold you in my heart!" "Let me plant a beautiful autograph on those lovely cheeks...!" "I wonder how I got so lucky" "When I behold the treasure I found..." "My priority is always you" "Oh how can I ever stay apart from you!" [Music] "Here I am so close to you," "Here I am, an equal part of you!" "I won't let even air come between us," "Let me hide you within myself!" "In a world where there is no dusk," "In this sleepless trance," "My warm breath on your chest," "is drawing your picture!" "All the time in the world," "Is never enough when I'm with you." "This life belongs to you." "This is my promise to you!" "Like the clouds that hide moisture," "Like the sky that holds clouds," "We need to be one mind, body and soul," "So let me hold you in my heart!" "My yesterdays, today and tomorrows" "Are now totally yours!" "I wonder how I got so lucky" "When I behold the treasure I found..." "My priority is always you" "Oh how can I ever stay apart from you!" Your bike needs brakes right away. I'm scared for my life whenever I ride this. Fine then. Bye. How long are you going to be like this? Mourning and waning away. He's not thinking about you! He's married and he's happy. Why are you punishing yourself? Don't blame Raj. He's a good guy. Yeah. If everybody is good, we really wouldn't need locks and passwords. You deserve better. That guy doesn't deserve you anyway! Maybe I'm not lucky enough to be Raj's wife. We have to accept that. Crazy girl! What time's the Vizag bus? 10PM Need a ride? No thanks! My uncle will drop me. Okay. - At least wear a helmet dude! Thank you for your life changing advice. Sir sir... I'm on my way. I'll be there in 5 minutes. [Screams] I need to tell you something. [Cell phone rings] Tell me. Maya met with an accident. - What? She's an orphan dude. Your investigations leads back to the mission she grew up in. She needs privacy. But I can't really stop the investigation. Please. Handle this quietly dude. Fine. I'll talk to the inspector and see what I can do. Please. She is inside. Was the accident life-threatening? We're having a hard time finding blood. AB negative. Not available. It's a rare group. I'm also AB negative, Have you had any fever or cold in the last week? No. Hey. She's a doctor's wife. You think we don't know? Mind your business! Sorry sir. Sorry madam. - It's OK. Are you pregnant? Why do you ask? Donating blood during pregnancy isn't good for you. What will happen? You'll grow weak. You need your strength to carry the baby. Your bones go weak and general health deteriorates! How is Maya doing? 50-50 chances madam. She's lost a lot of blood. We've had no luck trying to find blood for her... Luckily you came along. I'm not pregnant. You can take the blood. Sure madam. 'Donating blood during pregnancy isn't good for you.' 'You'll grow weak.' 'You need your strength to carry the baby.' Her entire face is deformed. We may need a foreign body. Maya's face may be lost to us forever. Can I see her once Satya? Raj. Raj... Let's go. What about the thing with the cops? I handled it. It's all good. Mahathi! - Maha! Maha... Don't worry Raj. She's just weak after donating blood. Take her home. I'll handle everything here. Maha... Come. Let's go. Careful Raj. Prep for the operation. Do as I say. I know what I'm doing. I think it's best if you're at the hospital now. Go there. I'll be fine. Are you sure? Fine. Be careful. Take care. Hello... Dude where are you? I'm out. I have an urgent errand. Tell me. But you left your car here! Ya, you were sleeping in it. I didn't want to wake you. I'm busy actually. Can I call you back? Alright. I'm going home. Are you? OK. Fine. Bye. [Cell phone rings] Hi. - Tell me. How are you? I'm fine. You'll feel dehydrated. Drink lots of water. Ya. I just had some. Also, How's Maya doing? I'm coming home. We'll talk after I get there. OK. Mahathi. - Huh? I love you. Mahi... My dear... Yes father. Are you upstairs? Daughter... Mahi... Daughter! No! My daughter! My dear Mahi...! My precious little Mahi...! My dear, please wake up. Daughter! Please wake up! [Crying] Maha! Maha! My dear daughter! Please get up. - Maha...! [Ambulance siren wails] Please sir. I'll talk to them. I don't care what it takes! You please come. It's very urgent. Very urgent sir! Please come. Ya... Did you find out anything? The doctors are looking after her. Do not worry. I called out to her so many times... She came rushing down to see me... She must have tripped and fallen... I'm responsible for my daughter's plight. It's all my fault! All mine! [Crying] She was hardly married for a year. Already her life is in tatters. I should have checked her horoscope properly! What are you talking about? Raj. Just shut up man. I mean... Horoscopes have nothing to do with what happened. You'll see your daughter, healthy within a month! I'm giving my word. Son-in-law! That wasn't what I meant! You please stop crying! You think I'm not sad? I mean... My daughter... Like that... I'm begging you. Please go home. She's my wife! And I'm perfectly capable of looking after her! Please go. I'll call you when she's better. Hey... Come. You come with me please! Come uncle. Let's talk. Uncle, We're doctors too, aren't we? You need not worry about anything! We'll take care of it. Come. Let me book a cab for you. Dr. Varma is here sir. Are you an illiterate? Sir, I did ask if she was pregnant. She said she wasn't. That's why I took the blood. Oh shut up! You don't have the common sense to test her first? But she was a doctor's wife. Get out! Just get lost! Sit down Raj. Sit down. I don't know how to tell you this... I'm sorry Raj. Mahathi is no more. Raj. Control. Please. Please. I don't know if you knew... She was pregnant. She donated blood while she was pregnant. That caused the weakness in her. She lost balance and fell over. I'm at a loss for words Raj. It's alright sir. I'm extremely sorry sir! I really did ask her. She even asked me why! And then she told me she wasn't pregnant. It's OK Pallavi! This wasn't your fault. Our profession prepares us to face the possibility of death! Please don't cry. Why would she have lied? Even though she was pregnant, she chose to risk it and save Maya. But then... She... Mahathi needs to live. If Mahathi has to live again, First, Mahathi's desire to save Maya Needs to live on! 'In a few moments, Mahathi and Maya are about to become one.' 'Maya losing something of hers,' 'Mahathi giving away something of hers,' 'this wasn't new.' The foundation to their relation, was on March 30, 2004. This drama competition sees so many participants annually, So many entertainers win our hearts each year. This year too, 20 teams are going to participate in the competition. There's a special attraction this year, two different groups have chosen to perform 'Sita Swayamvaram' To find out who will win the competition and our hearts, We need to wait just a little bit more. Salutations to Lord Ram. Where did you go? - Nowhere. Perform well, OK? - Sure. Do you remember all your dialogues? Dialogues? What did Sita even do during the 'Swayamvar'? All she has to do is sit in a corner! Doesn't matter if Sita sat quietly and Rama does miracles for her. This episode is still called 'Sita Swayamvaram' You know what? See that girl there? She's the Sita from that other team. Sita! What's your name dear? Maya Fernandez aunty. From the Theresa orphanage. Where is that? - Hyderabad. Why are you crying? I was just getting ready. Someone stole my costume bag. All my properties are lost. Oh no! Two beautiful Sita Devi's! What a sight. Hope no evil eye falls on you. Mahathi. Maya. [Phone ringing] Hello... Sir, Maya woke up from her coma. OK. 10 minutes. I'm on my way. Welcome back. Thank you. Where's Satya? Satya's on his way. Mahathi? Why don't you answer? Maya. Don't panic. Everything will be alright! It was a major accident Maya. Your entire face was deformed. The day after your accident, Mahathi unfortunately fell down from the stairs and... She's no more. I've transplanted her face onto yours. [Sobbing] Don't get stressed out Maya. It's not good for you now. Calm down. [Sighs] I went through a lot these last two months Maya. I'm drained. I'm exhausted. Two important people in my life, going through mishaps so suddenly... One after the other. I just couldn't take it. And the surgery, It was an emotional decision. I couldn't save Mahathi. If I couldn't save you too, then it's a shame on my education and my profession! Please don't cry. Seeing you in tears makes me wanna cry. Can I ask you for one favor? Please? Raj... You've given me another shot at life. You can ask me for anything. After Maha died, I've lost the will to live, Maya. But her dad still has hope! You've always hated being an orphan. I want to gift you, a family. Mahathi's family. Just for a few days, can you please be that old man's daughter? I know, asking this off you now, It's not right. Help me Maya please! Just for a few days. We'll tell him the truth slowly. Can you please give me some time? Sure. Raj, I don't care if you're married or not, One thing is always constant. I love you Raj. If I say yes, will you feel better? Yes. OK. [Crying] Thank you so much Maya. Thank you. [Cell phone rings] Raj... Yes Maya... Can I ask you something? Yes, you can. Is it enough to be that man's daughter? Don't you want a wife? I'm not ready for that now. If I say yes, Will you feel better? [Crying] Two more weeks. You need to heal first. Then we'll talk about it. [Music] "All your nightmares end at dawn," "Let me manifest that for you," "Let us banish all that bothers you," "All your worries and anxieties." "I have become everything you've dreamed of," "I have finally reached you," "The worry and concern for me," "I see it in your eyes..." "A mirror made of water," "reflecting the gorgeous night" "Now sees a reflection of the new moon," "The changed face of divinity." "The lone cloud has burst," "The burst of rain brings us together," "Like a dream that hides behind shut eyes..." "A bountiful tomorrow beckons us." "Like a festival," "A joyous celebration," "A culmination of all my dreams!" "Yet a tear runs down your cheek," "Your heart hides great sorrow." "The pain that yesterday left on us," "Let's come together to heal them." Maya. Are all your tattoos covered? It's better to be silent before them. Shall I ask them not to come? I'll manage. [Vehicle approaching] They're here. Maya, Nose ring. Come. They're here! Hello uncle! Please come. What did you bring? Mangoes... The juicy ones! I was afraid I'd miss them this year. Aunty... Let's go up. Mahi... How are you my dear? Say something my dear. You don't even call us anymore. Uncle! She's still in recovery. It'll take time for her to recognize everybody. Does that mean, she's forgotten the past? Ya.. Something like that. You watch a lot of soap operas don't you? Aunty, you know all about soaps. Tell her. So, She doesn't recognize any of us now? Yes uncle. Just a few more days. How many times did I tell you people? You need to get her horoscope checked out with my astrologer. No one cares what I have to say. I asked you to take them to Durga temple before sending her off! Nobody listens to me when I say this stuff! Look what happened now! Mahi... Do you recognize me? Mahi... I knew it my dear. I knew it! You love your aunt the most! Did she recognize anyone of you? No. Only me! That's how much she loves me. My sweetheart! Oh no! Does it hurt? I'm sorry dear! I wasn't paying attention. Forgive me sweetheart. Aunty... Meeting people might overwhelm her. Let her rest for a few days. I'll bring her home next month. You do that. I'll take care of the rest. Come now. You all are not needed here. Let's move. He will take care of her. Let's go. Oh go brother. Aunty, - Careful. I'm sorry, you couldn't spend more time with her. No no. You need not apologize. I over reacted at the wedding because Mahi wasn't marrying my son. That's all. Aren't you like my son too? Take care of her. [Sighs] [Thunder rumbling] [Sobbing] Maya? Maya... What happened sweetheart? Do you have to go? It's a small thing. I'll be back in 3 days. I'll come with you. Book a ticket for me too. If that was possible, we'd have gone on our honeymoon. Fine. It's time for your flight. Get ready. OK. What's this? Fine. You cannot say no... I'll come drop you at the airport. Darling, Maybe don't bring up driving again! Yes. I say no. Miss you my dear. I'll miss you too Raj! I cannot believe this Maya! Is your health OK? Much better. I feel like I'm talking to a stranger. Maya are you happy? Of course. But poor Mahathi. I pity her. Somehow I pity you... Why? See, first of all I'm very happy for you. You married the guy you love. Your house has changed, Your lifestyle has changed, Your relationship status has changed, Most importantly, the reflection you see in the mirror has changed completely. What has changed for Raj? Same life, same house. This is the face of the wife he married. What are you trying to say? He wakes up to Mahathi's face. He is kissing Mahathi's face. When will you have your space at this rate? Fine. Let's say you're right. I still don't have a problem. Let it be. Let him love Mahathi. Maya... You've changed so much. Mine was never a normal life like yours. I don't know who my parents are. I grew up in an orphanage. Coming to Raj, I've loved him for 9 years. I was sure I had lost him. This accident was a god-sent second chance. So he loves Mahathi? Challenge accepted. I will become Mahathi. In pursuit of the purest love, There's nothing wrong in changing oneself. Sorry. I thought you had changed. I was mistaken. You're the same stubborn Maya! Drink your coffee. [Phone chimes] [Cell phone rings] Oi! Yes. What was that photo? I tried to look more like Mahathi. She's your wife. I thought you'll love it. No Maya. Don't do that. You just be yourself. I love Mahathi. I don't deny that. But I like Maya too... So, don't take Maya away from me. I love you. I love you too... Bye. Sorry... Mother? Mother. Mother, I shared everything with you. But you're gone now. I dunno what to do. That's why I'm sending you these voice notes instead. Cutie. Today someone came home with a marriage proposal He's a renowned doctor from Hyderabad. He's good looking. His voice just sounded magical. He's great. Is he really? Everything happened so fast. Dad agreed right away. I'm pretty sure he's the one I'm marrying. [Clears throat] Wish you were here mother. I like this new house. He treats me like a friend. He never let's go of me. He's touchy feely, 24X7. He's a hardcore romantic. Sounds fun... Give me something interesting... What about romance? [Mahathi sobbing] I wish my husband drops dead! When he was touchy feely all the time, I thought he was a romantic. He's a perverted psychopath. He only ever cares about himself. My situations, my pain, Never once crossed his mind. There's never a good or bad time. There's never a good or bad place. He never listens. No matter how much I beg him not to... Every time I hear the sound of a door opening, Just the thought of him coming closer to me, Made me unable to breath out of anxiety. In the confines of our marital bed, I saw a monster everyday that the world would never see. They say, That walls have ears. If only these walls had eyes instead, They would crash down one day, And kill this monster once and for all. [Crying] [Bell rings] Hi! - Hey! Come. What's up Maya? You called me suddenly? Raj isn't home. I'm bored. I wanted to have a drink. So I called you. Why Satya? Don't you want to? Hey, nothing like that. Just casual. Shall we drink? - Why not? Hey, let's drink by the pool. Wow! Exciting. - Come. Sitting and drinking with you like this, Feels so very good. Oh come on... We've had drinks together before. No. Not like that. Me and Raj used to drink together a lot, Mahathi used to sit far away from us. And now Mahathi is pouring drinks herself, Damn! Exciting. I almost forgot. Your dad... I mean Mahathi's dad called, Raj's horoscope is indicating danger apparently. He wanted me to tell Raj. [Laughs] What's the point of telling him? He doesn't believe in all this horoscope nonsense. [Laughs] Silly fellow... By the way, do you believe it? No. Not at all. But be careful, Let Raj know. Why Satya? If something happens to Raj, You're here to look after me, right? Ya. That is there no... You don't worry Maya, No matter what happens, I'll take care of you. I'm there no, Use me, dude! - Satya... Satya... - Ya.. Mahathi... Maya! Maya! You have me under your spell. - Tell me the truth. You're attracted to Mahathi, right? No comments. OK...? Tell me Satya... Are you attracted? Or not? Come. Come with me. Mahathi.. Are you serious? Yes baby! Oh I'm so excited! What's next? Maya? [Screaming in pain] What the F*** Maya?! Are you insane? What are you doing? October 23rd. The day of my accident. The day Mahathi died. What actually happened? So you know the truth? I am excited to find out. In the book named 'Mahathi' This is the middle page. Interval block. Tell me exactly what happened. Otherwise baby, You'll have no more babies...! [Groans] Raj and Mahathi had a disturbed relationship. Raj is a sex addict. Mahathi couldn't handle that. [Thunder rumbling] I hoped that she would quietly bear my wild fantasies. She bloody learned to hit back! Dude! She's a good girl man... What good? Dude! She's dumb! She fell for my stupid 'tea proposal' and agreed to marry me. [Thunder rumbling] I did a mistake Satya! I should have married Maya. Hey! What are you talking? Give me that glass! I'm in my senses! Dude, I had already gone and fixed the wedding, That's when Maya proposed. That day, The dress she was wearing, Her smell... [Sniffs] I felt I made a mistake marrying Mahathi. Dude... - But no! I controlled myself! I felt I rushed into a commitment with Mahathi. The shock of it left me speechless. Poor me... Dude what are you talking man? You know what? Every story Maya wrote, She named the hero after me. That's why... I read all of them. Bloody hell...! All those stories had amazing romance... If her writings are like this, Imagine her actually doing stuff. Coincidentally, you had an accident at the same time. Mahathi had given you her blood. Raj checked your reports at the hospital. Blood group, height, You and Mahathi were a perfect match. Why does everything keep happening to me? First, Maya's face gets deformed in a horrible accident. Then Mahathi loses her balance, has a fall, slips into a coma and dies...! And then Mahathi's face is given to Maya. Bro, when did all this happen man? Mahathi donated blood just now. What happened to Mahathi? Not now dude. This happens tomorrow morning. - [Gasps] Raj, I'm scared man. Scared of what? This is what criminals like her deserve! She deserves this. Here! She slapped me here! Isn't that wrong? Isn't that domestic violence? How can she beat her husband like this? Tomorrow morning, Mahathi goes into a Coma. I'll maintain this sadness as I bring her to the hospital. Even as she's dying, she's donating her blood to Maya, donating her face. Bro! Can you do something for me? What? Nothing! Just enjoy the drama. OK? OK? Go sleep. Need to begin acting way too early tomorrow. Let's do it properly. Sleep. Bro, Poor Mahathi... Hey! Stop pitying her OK?! Think about me OK! My wife is the one dying. Not Mahathi's wife. Go to sleep. OK? I was freaking scared of Raj at that moment. So I ran away from there. [Laughs] You'd be dehydrated. Drink plenty of water. Mahi... Yes father... He took the opportunity and sent Mahathi's father away! He arranged for a secret operation. He smuggled out Mahathi's body under Maya's name. He buried Mahathi in Maya's place. [Groans] What a massive fraud! He got me begging him to marry me...! You managed to trap me too! Maya... Maya, Maya, please Maya! I didn't do anything. Please Maya! I just stayed silent, that's all. Maya, Maya, Maya... Where are you going? Please forgive me. Sorry Maya! Please Maya... Please! I've recorded the whole thing. You guys are so done now! Maya, I did nothing! What an innocent lamb you are... OK.. Tell me this. Don't you have any shame? lusting after your friend's wife? Don't dare to call yourself a friend! It's not like that Maya...! No point telling you anything! You're friends with a rogue like Raj so naturally you're a dog too. Button up! Now! I've sent this video to someone. I won't say who. If something happens to me, This video becomes viral! Do not get any bright ideas! Get lost! [Groans] You remained silent and did nothing. This is your punishment. Hey Satya... Can you do something for me? What should I do? Nothing! Just enjoy the drama! [Snaps finger] I believe in horoscopes too. I'm the danger in Raj's future! Get lost! MA-HA-THI Vadlamani Sri Naga Sai Mahathi Sharma. Before we actually met, I hated you. After I met you, I was jealous at first sight. You look better than me. You married the guy I like. In the end, You gave me your life and left. Thank you so much Mahathi...! I will never be able to repay you. Actually, I can repay... I will repay. I took your face, blood and life! I will also take your revenge! See, If we forgive sinners like this, Neither Krishna nor Jesus will forgive us. We shall do something big. [Cell phone rings] Look, It's our husband. I'll take care of him tomorrow. You rest now. Do you know, Alcohol makes you so hungry! I feel hungry Mahathi! [Phone chimes] From now, I am Mahathi. Until I see his end tomorrow. I won't even drink a drop of water. [Glass smashed] [Cell phone rings] Darling, How long do I have to wait? Sweetie, I'll be there in one hour. You know what, I'm so excited. Shall we add some more excitement to it? Come on sweetie... Go on.. Bring out the writer in you. How about... role play? It'll be exciting. You need to pounce on me wildly... And I'll say no. OK. And again, I'll say no! And I'll say no to your no... You will jump me, force me, I want to see your wildness baby... And? What else? The rest will happen naturally... Sweetie... Just wait and see... Just wait and see dude! Buddy. Go faster. [Bell rings] [Bell rings] Raj.. Raj, please Raj! Please... stop it! What's it sweetie? You're in character. But why are you wearing a saree? It's OK. Never mind. Done. Action! Maya. Will you come? Or not? Please Raj. Please I beg you Raj! Please Raj. Please Raj. Please... Please... Please! Enough Maya. This isn't working. Cut. Game cancel. First, change the saree. Let's try normally. Raj.. Please Raj! Please no! - Enough of your over acting. Compared to your acting all these days, My acting is nothing! I know you killed Mahathi! So you found out then... Don't worry about it Maya. No big deal. Killing this face, Hiding the body, Is nothing new to me. Chill sweetie. No don't do that... Please. Please. The police will be here soon. You can have tasty 3 roses tea in jail. I controlled myself a lot. Even after doing the world's best surgery, I couldn't brag about it. That's where you started limiting me. You know how much I loved you? I cannot stand by and watch as you turn me into a complete failure. [Coughs] What did I come here for? What the hell am I doing? First, let's take care of that. Then we can peacefully plan the murder. When a child is born, It makes the parents really happy. You have no clue whom your birth made happy... You poor orphan. But, Before you die, You're making me happy. What an upgrade in life! Congratulations Maya sweetie... Happy journey...! How could you kill a pregnant woman Raj? You took two innocent lives! And then self pity on top of that. Stop it Maya! Stop it! Bloody stop it! I really loved you! Because I loved you, I got rid of Mahathi. Do you know the kind of miracle I pulled off? I bloody recreated a person. I gave life to you! You know, If I had done this for anyone else, So many awards, so many rewards, You have no idea! But, I still hid it! You're just a bloody experiment! The magic these hands did. Nobody else can! My education, my intelligence, my profession You ruined everything by calling the cops! You bloody B****! Hats off Raj! Hats off to your skill and your talent! Thanks for loving me. Our society needs intelligent people like you. But it has no need for sadists like you! [Crying] You'll never change Raj. Maya.. No! [Police siren wails] Maya, are you crying? At least tell me the truth. Sruthi, First of all, I'm not Maya. Mahathi I, Mahathi, Was being sexually assaulted by my husband since 8 months. So I hit him on the head with a hammer! That's all. - Maya you are scaring me... Maya died in a road accident! The person sitting here, The person talking to you, Is Mahathi, who gave me everything since childhood! Mahathi is the one attending court today. Ok. Does your lawyer know the truth? No one knows. He's the only one who came forward to fight for Mahathi. His fight is also for Mahathi. Sir is here. Let's go. You don't worry. Maya would have won if she had charged you with murder. She went for a marital rape case because of her CCTV evidence. Marital Rape isn't legally recognised. The entire case will be... turned in our favor. Let her bring any big shot to oppose me! I will make him leave the case and run away! Either my arguments will beat him down or the lengthy legal process will. If he doesn't fall for either, Then we throw money at him. He will fall. Maya thinks she's so intelligent. She will never smile again. I've successfully defended a lot of people in my career. But now, I'm defending my friend's son. It's personal. I don't care who is behind her... We are winning this case! He has been torturing me for a very long time. That's why I set up CCTV cameras when he wasn't home. Soon as he got home, he began forcing me for sex. I refused. I told him that I was on my period. He said he didn't care and pounced on me. I said no. He hit me on the head with a flower vase. He pinned me against the wall. He threw me on the dining table. This has been happening for so long. I had to defend myself. I hit him with a hammer that I found lying around. Ms Mahathi, you may leave now. That's it your honor. Rajkumar, a sexual pervert. Showed the gap between education and culture. Forcing wife for sex without even taking her health into consideration. It's a shameful act. And that is why, under relevant sections for Rape, unnatural sex and attempted murder cases, The accused needs to be punished in the strictest terms. Objection! Are we done sir? Or do you want to tell people to please Like, Share and Subscribe? [Laughs] Order! Order! Order! Mr. Vishwa seems to have prepared a nice little monologue. He even delivered it with a great modulation. Now coming to the point. We watched a good cinema today. Presented on Maya TV, A fantastic dubbing film directed by Ms Mahathi...! Sree Lakshmi Ganapathi films! Translated and dubbed brilliantly from a silent feature to Telugu! When she says jump, This man asks 'How High?' This is just like saying, When a doctor writes a joke, only the medical shop guy gets it! Good job Ms Mahathi. You have a great future in dubbing. My blessings are always with you. If you don't trust what's being said, Consider what you are seeing. That video is proof of the truth your Honor. And one more thing, There's a great comedian in Mr. Vashishta. He can make people laugh without sound effects. Wow! You have a bright future as a comedian sir. [Laughs] Silence! Mr. Vashishta! I.. I'm sorry. I'm sorry your Honor. All that you have heard till now, is very different from what happened there. Video please. My client Rajkumar who had just returned from Bangalore. Tried to be intimate with his wife, like always... Innocent chap... He had no idea she planned this whole thing And setup a CCTV camera in the house. He wanted to be intimate out of love. He thought she was joking around. But Mahathi didn't stop there. She threatened to bring his family on to the streets. My client Rajkumar couldn't tolerate what she said. He hit her with the vase in anger. He tried stopping her from going crazy, He wanted to try and find out why she was behaving like this. She hit him across the head with a hammer! And damaged his jawline in a brutal attack. Your Honor, My client Rajkumar is unable to speak now. That's why, We present a written affidavit detailing what actually happened. Objection your Honor. He made fun of Mahathi saying it was a dubbing film. So what is he doing now? That's not what happened there. Even after a woman said NO, Rajkumar couldn't control himself and attacked her. Forcing someone even after they say No and withdraw consent, to try and satiate one's sexual desires is called Rape! That woman can be his wife, a stranger or even a sex worker! It's still called Rape. These are not even opinions. Just cinema dialogues! Instead of blabbing all this, Along with that CCTV footage, You should have loaded 'Pink' movie onto the same pen drive. That would have been easier. Consider this, Movies that try to teach us that "No means No", Also tell us that a woman's No is never actually a No. Which is true? The word 'Rape' is being thrown around so casually. What is rape? When a culprit attacks a victim, Physically damages and mentally abuses them, satiates their desires and leaves. This loaded word, Rape, How can they heartlessly use it to describe a holy union like marriage? It is the husband's duty to fulfill every desire of his wife. At the same time, fulfilling a husband's desires, is also the wife's duty. Ok sir. Let's assume you are right. Waking up early and preparing coffee, Preparing meals 3 times a day, Maintaining the house and getting into bed at night, These are the duties of a wife. In return, the husband looks after her, Earns, gives her money and love... All this is the salary given to the wife. Right? Yes. You're right. - OK! If that is right, If it is indeed right, The work she does becomes her profession, Her house becomes her office, And forcing her in spite of resisting several times, Makes this animal... Makes this person the boss in that office, And this situation is then called sexual harassment at the work place! And that's wrong too. That is a crime too! Sir seems to have lost his mind. He himself is not clear about what he's arguing. Anyway possible, just arresting my client Rajkumar seems to be the only agenda on his mind. But there's no logic in his argument. Objection. - Sit down man... Objection overruled. Mr. Vashishta, you continue. Thank you your Honor. Your Honor, Money and sex, is desired by every human being alive. But people who strive for those things are looked down by our society. One such victim is my client Rajkumar. The first culprit here, is social media. All this rabble became active because of social media. Everybody who posts is a lawyer, Everybody who comments is a judge. Every house is a court. Becoming famous, is that easy! [Snaps finger] If they had stopped at video's and TikToks, we'd be fine. Making fools out of men and labeling husbands as rapists, has become commonplace. There's no need for courts anymore, A single tweet does the job. Your Honor, Previously how many so called 'Marital Rape' cases did we have? Very few! And why is that? That is the value our generation gave to the bond of marriage. That's not value. It's fear! How dare you interrupt when opposing counsel is speaking?! Don't you know court etiquette?! Mr. Vashishta, Vashishta! - How many cases have you worked? How many?! - Mr. Vashishta! First one. - Please control yourself. Do you know how many I've fought? Fifty! You will be found to be in contempt of court. Learn to respect your seniors. Sit down! Sit down! Mr. Vashishta! I'm sorry your Honor! A marriage is an agreement between two individual lives. Kids these days only know the cost of it, But not the value. As a father of two, You know this very well. Your Honor. Why were such cases almost non-existent before? Only because, the process to understand each other was solid! And that, was the value they gave to relationships. When two people live together, difference of opinion is natural. Sometimes the man desires sex, and the woman doesn't. Now let's reverse this situation, When a wife desires sex, and the husband refuses, He's labelled a *****! I repeat your Honor! This isn't a swear word. This is the naked truth! The man is labelled impotent. And the woman divorces him. And that! Is this generations mentality! I have an open challenge. Any couple in their 40s and 50s can be a witness in this case. Can you bring them, And prove to the court that they too have suffered Marital Rape At the hands of their spouse? No! Every little problem is being magnified a hundred times! Choosing to throw constitution at people instead of compromising! Dragging a doctor's reputation through the mud. And wasting valuable time of the Honorable court. I request the court to strike this case off! One last word your Honor. It's wrong. Attacking her with a flower vase was my client's mistake. If the Honorable court decides to fine us for that, We accept without any argument. I rest my case here your Honor! [Clears throat] Mr. Vishwa, Do you wish to add anything? Your Honor, Firstly, I apologize to counsel for interrupting his statements. Extremely sorry sir. [Laughs] Mr. Vishwa, What do you think you're doing? I understand sir. 'Marital Rape' "Sexual intercourse without consent of spouse, " This is something that none of us are capable of understanding. I understand this clearly now. If an apartment has 15 flats, this is a common crime that takes place in at least 4 of those flats. Across the world, This is a heinous crime that a single culprit perpetrates on a single victim. Everyday. Again and again! Our law says that every innocent person deserves justice. Nowhere does it say "According to law"! Didn't he say that every house is a court? People using their marital problems for publicity are only about 10% of the total... Women who are unable to come out with what happened to them, women quietly suffering abuse to protect their family name, women that fear societal judgment and stay to themselves, Those women number thousands... Thousands... I live in a society that doesn't grasp the seriousness of this issue. I'm a victim sir. Hundreds of women like this come and tell horror stories of abuse. I'm a helpless witness sir! I studies law for 5 years with fantasies of changing this world. I'm a lawyer sir. That's why I stand here today! He tortured Mahathi for several months sir! He didn't leave her even in the prayer room! He didn't leave her during her period. He routinely shackled and raped her. She finally managed to muster some courage to come to court, And this guy and his flower vase... These guys want to pay a fine for the flower vase! You cannot divert this case by speaking emotionally! How dare you interrupt when opposing counsel is speaking!! Sit down. Sit down! [Whistles] Who is that? Order... Order! Mr. Vishwa... You continue. Your Honor, Today was a day of firsts... Nobody was interrogated. The witnesses to the crime include the judge and 50 other witnesses... A lawyer stood in the witness box. How much longer are we going to refrain from taking a stand, Just because it is legally unprecedented? Why don't you set a new precedent sir? Give hope to those voiceless victims! Strike fear among those that think "Who's gonna punish me for this?" Your Honor, The triumph of law, is not in just giving justice to an innocent. It is in striking fear in the heart of a criminal sitting at home. Mr. Vashishta, You kept saying not to compare this with Rape. If you ask me, rape is better than this. At least a rape victim has the chance to file a case on the culprit. But in case of spousal rape, The next day, The victim has to wake up early and cook breakfast for the culprit again. [Clapping] [Crying] The judgment will be passed in the next hearing. Thank you, your Honor. You underestimated me a lot sir. Just to reach your expectations, I had to bow down low... Put aside winning and losing. As a man, you've already lost. You were worried about your friend's son. You couldn't really think about your wife. The issue here, isn't men and women. It is about the value we give to the opinions of another human being. Remove the headphones called patriarchy and toxic masculinity from your ears, there are many more claps you need to listen to. [Crying] [Crying] Oh... Now you're acting like you don't smoke at all! You think you're Kamal Haasan? Why did you come here child? You probably have more important things to do... What is the need to turn into Mahathi now? In the pursuit of purest love, It's ok to even change yourself, Dad. This is a new chapter in the annals of this court. This is a new beginning. Vadlamani Mahathi, Was tortured and abused by her husband Dr. Rajkumar. He then attacked her. As per IPC section 375, Forced sex, IPC section 377, Unnatural sex. And IPC Section 307, attempt to murder. He is sentenced to 10 years hard labor. Thank you. Congratulations. Won't you say anything sir? What's your name Ms Mahathi? Excuse me? Don't worry, tell me your real name. Why are you asking that? The real Mahathi wouldn't have called me 'Sir'... She'd have called me 'Cousin'. Tell me. It's ok. Maya Fernandez. You were my Mother's friend from Mahathi's wedding? She told me. I did all this to be thankful to Mahathi... You knew she was murdered. Why did you agree to this? For too long we've shared stories of women who've lost. When we talk about women who've won, More people tend to get inspired. Nothing I do will bring back my Mahathi. I just wanted to introduce the world to a Mahathi who won! That's the least we can do for those we love. We didn't fight for this case... We fought for a cause. Congratulations on your first win, cousin! Congratulations to us! We made it!
