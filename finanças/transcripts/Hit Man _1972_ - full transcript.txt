[intense music] [female #1] 'Huh...Yeah?' This is Tyrone Tackett. Cornell's brother. He sent me the telegram. 'What do you want?' I'm here in L.A., the airport. Need a ride. 'Ha, ha, ha. You Tacketts had your last ride on me.' Cornell said, you was a general informant. 'Of course. I gave what he wanted. You, are another story.' What about the funeral arrangement? I mean, is somebody with my brother? You was his own lady? 'If that's what he told you, you got some spotting up to do.' 'Cornell's dead, so are you for all I care.'

[jazz music] [people chattering] You mean, somebody's been talking to you about me? Oh, yeah. You are a real superstar, baby. Yeah. Well, sweet man. You're about to get the superstar treatment. - Oh, yeah? - Mm-mm. Come on. Why don't you tell me who it was that bragged on me? Cornelle Tackett. My brother. Thanks for the telegram. You know, you come off real hard on the phone, Irvelle. I could still be at the airport watching them planes land. - Tyrone. - Tyrone Tackett, mama. Now, my brother is dead and I wanna know why. I don't know nothing. Where's his daughter, Rochelle? I don't know nothing about her. Well, maybe you need sometime to freshen your memory. And I'm gonna call you about the funeral. And you gonna talk and I'm gonna listen. I don't dig funerals, man. - Cornell will never know. - Well, I will. I mean after all, Irvelle, you was Cornell's...thing. So I'll see you at the funeral. Huh? Superstar. Rochelle. Hey, Rochelle? [intense music] [church organ music] Was he in bad shape? No, they fished his car out of the water about an hour after he went through the rail. He drowned? The police said, your brother drowned in alcohol before he hit the water. Rochelle. How you doing? I'm sorry about your father. What the cops say? Anything? They said, your old man's dead. How's centennials? I left school last year. - What're you doing? - I'm doing Woolworth's. Woolworth's? Where you gonna live? I've got friends. Look, I'd really like it.. Me and my old lady, if you'd come to Oakland and live with us. Cornell would have dug it if we stuck together. What's she doing here? She's a friend of your father's. She was no friend. Glad you could make it, Irvelle. I didn't know when to come and get your ass. What's wrong between you and Rochelle? I ain't got nothing to do with her, you understand? Cornell talked a lot about you. You know that? I thought y'all was pretty tight and everything. I saw her a couple of times. I wasn't family. But you was his main thing after his old lady walked out on him. - Don't shine me over, Irvelle. - Look man. I don't know nothin' about nothing, you got that? And that's the righteous truth. You should keep your head open, here. When I'm ready, we're gonna sit down and talk about it and you're gonna tell me something. This might keep you alive. Bitch. Shall we pray? 'Heavenly father.' 'As we prepare to commit the body of' 'your servant, Cornell Tackett to the crematorium's fires.' 'We pray that his soul shall be spared from the hell fires' 'of eternal damnation.' Cornell was one fine dude. - I'm Sherwood Epps. - How you doing? No lie. He sure was. I'm Emerson Rays. My pleasure. Cornell spoke of both you guys, man. Glad you came out. Thank you, thank you very much. Sure gonna miss him. Mr. Tackett? Mr. Tackett. We're, uh, former friends of your brother's. You got our condolences. Uh, he's not finished yet, Mr. Tackett. See, we wanted to say goodbye here. 'Cause we know we won't be seeing you after the burial. Since you'll be heading right back to Oakland. Not burial, a cremation. You see, Tacketts' don't dig being pushed into the ground. I'm sure I'll see you brothers again. If you do, Mr. Tackett. You're going to be hurtin' real bad. Now that your brother's been taken care of.. There's nothing keeping you here at all. Now, you keeping me here, man. Sherwood? How long, you and my brother were partners? Me and Cornell started in a used car business together. Just 'em flenders and then re-polish. He's the best damn hot wire man, I ever saw. 'And now he's gone.' 'Crashes through a fence, ends up dead in the ocean.' 'I can't figure it out.' 'It just don't make sense.' Real worth dying. I have some news. You don't think Cornell dropped it on himself. Eh, man, forget that shit. That's not the way you see it boy! The last time you saw him, how was he acting? - Was he hit bad? - Hmm. He was a little bit edgy. Nobody knows a damn thing. He's a super fine man. You motherfuckers. What's the matter with this chick? It should be okay, if she gets her head straightened. - 'I'm sorry, bro.' - Really, you think so? No, no. I am. I'm a man of storm. - See you later. - Yeah. Okay, man. - Lay down, sir. - How will I've known? I guess that she is uptight about this whole thing. Hey Tyron, I like to go there and repo a Continental from a dude. You give me a hand, you got yourself a car to drive. Sure, where do you got it? Where's the car anyway? Odeon Broadway. Sherwood, you know Julian Swift? Yeah, I know him. He falls about 27 down there. Trying it through to make on me for a Cadillac. Now that I'll go on big time, you know.. Where is he at? Who he was seen doing. He doesn't know what's going on. You know they tell me, he's training fighting dogs you know, Pit bulls or something like that. - Does he so? - That's right. Yeah. He was a big highroller. - No shit. - He's the trainer. - Tailraiser. - Really..oh, oh. When I was a kid, he was in for nothing. He might have been a trailblazer but he gone to dogs now. 'Say, man?' 'How'd you come you do know Swift, anyway?' 'Streets, man. He ruled our neighborhood.' - Hey, Sherwood. - What's happening? What about I go over there, Sherwood? Everybody knows she was a whore. Let's just say, she let her little light shine. I got a special 90 day deal on this baby. Come on in the office, I've got other things I wanna show you. 'You might have to kill me to get this car back, Sherwood.' Ha, ha. That ain't nothing, baby. Thanks, Sherwood. That got me alive in here. Oh, man. Enough of your shit. Oh, I can tell this cat's handwriting. You think I didn't know? Look, man. I am tryin' a unload this 90-day double guaranteed turkey. It ain't even got no music, man. Now, all of a sudden, you're a handwriting expert. Yeah, I'm tryin' to close the deal with my man, Tyrone. - God damn right. - Now, you get outta here-- You're so smashed, you couldn't close the damn door. Yes, he could. Hey, man. Hey! Hey, hey wait a minute motherfucker. 'Hey, come back here, nigger.' Laural says you're A-okay with it. [female #2] 'Hello.' I bet you miss me already. Don't you baby? I'm sorry, but you have the wrong number. This is Oakland, the Biggs. Rita, do you know what I like? I like it when you be stickin' 'em big brown titties in my ass. - 'I see.' - Yeah, but then I don't. We should tell Merri what goes on when you making 'em old dirty pictures of me. You tell him. Here, Merri. Mer? There's some creep on the phone with the most foul mouth 'that I've ever heard.' Look, Mr. Jive-ass. 'It's freaks like you that give' 'legitimate pornography a bad name.' Probably, just saw your latest movie. [jazz music] Do we go and get on the neighbor? I'm gonna stay all night 'cause I might get lucky this time. You know what I mean? I keep tidy around, like your private cars, you see. Oh, is that right? Maybe a husband get lucky too and catch it. It ain't like that, now. My man ain't Peaches, Big Daddy. It's Laural. How'd you know my name was Big Daddy? 'Cause, I had checked you out. You know I'd sleep too but party is four. Oh, one of my permanent guests has checked out you know. - Must've forgotten. - Permanent? The ones that cut the motors off? Hey, Laural. You got any change? Fat Al, won't make it no more without that magic fingers vibrating. Oh, get your ass back to your room. God damn, Waste King. You know I run a respectable, commute orientated establishment here. - Umm, you're travelling man? - Commuter. Well, the toilet's right here. And we clean it every day. Real quire? Well, I keep my springs well-oiled.. ...Tyrone. [jazz music] How fast was he goin'? Fast enough to go through this fence. Of course it's hard to tell without skid marks. 'Probably some suicide, I guess.' Sure in hell, wished they'd stayed at home and opened up a Van or something. 'It was my brother, man.' [intense music] Shit! Man, you almost shot my derby. You shoot my derby, I'm gonna whoop your ass. 'Bugger shot my car. Nigger!' [crowd chattering] Any of you great boys want to cover? - How much can you stand, huh? - Two hundred and-- - What's it worth, thief? - Your mama-- Do we have Swift, around? Keep looking around. He's around. [crowd chattering] - White suits you, Shag. - Tyrone Tackett. Shag Merriweather. [crowd cheering] Word was, you was a police in, Oakland. Yeah, well I'm back on the streets now. Visiting family? I would be, if they was here. - Moved? - No, dead. Hey, get him, Joey. Get him. [crowd cheering] You're working for Theatis Oliver? Not, Nano Zito, man. Why are you asking, man? I'm from the welfare department. I'm checking to see that you niggers stay employed. God man. Get off my case. I have not yet begun to get on your case, brother. Come on, Joey. Shit!

Give his regards. Oh nice boy. Is he's getting richer on 'em tid movies up in Oakland? Yeah, he's making grand theft dough. That's the way it should be. I heard about your loss. My sincerest sympathies. 'Cornell, was a nice boy.' You are on next, Mr. Zito. Me and Gussle play. $100 a point. You're the boss. Soft. Not like the old man here. So, you know Murray Biggs, huh? He's my boss. He came to see, Mr. Zita on business. He said he was going to make me a star. - 'Where the hell have you--' - 'Right here.' [chuckles] - 'Pass it Mr. Zito.' - 'That ain't nothin'.'

You want to play me boy? Where I come from boss, we only play the winners. Hey Gozalda, show Tackett, where to change. You're about to play a winner. You shut up. This way, please. [jazz music] When Murray was here, he and I became very tight. - Oh, yeah. - Mm-hm. I went for a damn good part in Shaft. Did you get it? Well, we'll talk about that later. If you like to see some film sometime. It's kind of a screen test. Maybe, you could rap to Murray about it. Are you the star? You know, I'm the star, for Murray, of course. Well, I figured that when I saw you. knew you was a star. - I can dig all that. - You think you can, hmm? Now's your chance. Get outta my way. You're in my way. Can you even play? Get Shag. I'll take winners. - You black bastard. - 'Hold it, Gussle.' Jesus, Tackett, what the hell has happened to you? You never used to give nobody no trouble. Always did what you was told.

And for you Presty's mother fuckers we got some cars - that'll make you wanna jump-- - Cut. Cut it. I'm afraid we can't use it. You said it again, Mr. Epps. Said what? What the fuck did I say? That word. - Oh shit! - Alright, roll it back. 'Don't fall apart. We'll go get in a minute.' - 'Where did I get that?' - I ain't got it man. Just ain't got it. [giggles] Shh. Yeah, well, guess you don't Sherwood? Any fool could dig on that. [laughs] Hey, you know a cat named, Huey? Dude, always wears a lid. Yeah, been following me around town. I think he works for Zito. Yeah, he came through here full of questions. - What'd you tell him brother? - I didn't tell him shit. Huh, you know me, baby. Sherwood, my man. - Look I got to split. - Yeah, where are you goin'? Oh, to the Hollywood. Keep your wallet in your mouth while you shower on baby. [chuckles] [upbeat music] [Tackett] 'Give me a coke, brother.' [male #1] 'Show me now.' Hey, Rochelle, what's up?

Got nothin' to say, huh? 'We'll let them split into somethin' 'if I don't see you tomorrow' 'oh, you'll be good, eh?' - And don't trust boys. - I already don't. - Here...buy Reggie a coke. - Thanks. Got a goodbye kiss for your uncle? You kiss like an uncle. [giggles] Hey, baby, did he? We got cash now. Come on now baby. Shit. 'How much money, we've got here?' 'Twenty, Thirty, Forty..' 'Shit, we got some blow money so fast.' '- See how much more we get.' - 'Oh yeah.' 'Eighty, Ninety. Hmm..' [female #3] 'Mr. Tackett.' I have something for you. Come around there. [instrumental music] - This was left for you. - Thank you. 'Oh, what is it?' It's my brother. Well, uh, guest in the room gonna cost extra. If that was true you'd be a millionaire, you know that? Can I use your phone? I'll get time and charges later. [phone ringing] - Hello. - Hey, baby. I sure do miss your fine stuff. Tyrone, when're you coming back to Oakland? - 'I wanna hold you.' - I'm holdin' you right now. 'Can you feel me? My warm touch.' - 'Where you at?' - By the pool. - What've you got on? - 'Black bikini.' Invisible? [giggles] No. - Take it off for me. - Murray's around. Take off the top. It's off. Now, take a handful. Mmm. 'Hold that left one for me. My favorite one, baby.' Umm. That's me holding you, baby. Touching you. Lips all over your body. I'm in your secret places.

'Tyrone Tackett!' What's happening baby, Huey? I see, you got yourself a new car. Yo, I wanna talk to you, Tackett. - Confidentially-- - Stay in the car, man. I'll come down and listen to you...confidentially. What's on your mind, man? I've been elected to pass this on to you. 'Plane leaves for Oakland at five minutes to twelve.' - You ain't late yet. - I might be. If you're on that plane, the only that you'll be is dead. How're you gonna make that happen? That white man you got in the back seat? You know, Nita Biggs, must be gettin' awfully lonely up there in Oakland. 'Nobody but her husband to keep her happy.' It's probably a white man taking care of her right now, Leon. You're starting to get on a hand, maybe. Ow. [instrumental jazz music] 'What're you doing?' What's going on down there? [music continues] Get up, God damn it. Get your rugged ass up. Get up Nigger. I'll knock you out. Come on, get up. Go on. [door bell rings] - Get in. - No, really. Ow! Look Huey, you gonna have some kinda agreement. Man I'm gonna kick all the black off your ass. Get off my case Tackett. This is LA. 'Just don't dig no out of town shit comin' down.' I didn't dig burying my brother either, sucker. Yeah, but you're messin' with some heavy weights. - The police will search-- - Fuck the police! They don't care if some Nigger gets off. - Look you motherfucker-- - No! Oh! You uptight about my coming down in here, weren't you? Hit that bastard. Hit him. What's going on? All the scream is gonna bring the police here. Shit, the noises going on in this place. - Ain't nobody gonna hear. - 'Who is it, man?' You know I can't.. - Nano Zito? - You know-- You're gonna tell me something. I can't tell you. You know, I can't. Got a name for me? Kill him. - Theatis.. - Kill him. Theatis. Ow, Theatis Oliver. Oww.. Who's Theatis Oliver? Some cat that run a chain of porno film theatres around town. Now, listen, Tackett. If I don't get the story, I'm-- Now look, Laural, you've been a real sunshine through all of this, baby. Now don't mess up. Alright, man, you got what you want out of me. - You gonna let me go? - Maybe you must be nuts. Look, don't let this guy near no phone. I wanna see Theatis Oliver. Tackett. Don't let on I was the one of fat mouth on Theatis. 'Sit down.' [music playing at distance] Damn, What the hell is going on here? What is this? - Jesus, well-- - Theatis, it's just a party. Don't get excited now. - I'll murder the little slit. - Theatis, they're only kids. [Yolanda] Theatis. Drinking all over the town.. Honey.. - Daddy. - That's right, sugar. Daddy. [Yolanda] Give her chance to explain. Daddy, you promised you won't be home until tonight. By tonight, my house will be on the six o'clock news. Is this what you call having few friends in for a coke, huh? Alright, turn off that goddamn music. 'Just get out, party time is over.' [indistinct chatter] [Theatis] 'Come on, let's go. Let's get out of here.' 'Jesus!' Sherry, your mama will hear about this. Your husband is a regular grouch. - Theatis. - That's a set up, Yolanda. [Theatis] 'Antoinette.' 'I'm not that dull, you idiot.' - Oh, my house is a wreck. - What's this smell in here? 'What you been smoking, Antoinette?' [Yolanda] 'Dolly, what have you been doing?' [Theatis] 'Open up.' 'Antoinette.' 'Antoinette, open that door.' Good afternoon. The door was open, so I just came on in. - Who are you? - I'm a neighbor. - I came about the noise. - Noise? What noise? Look, I just wanna see Oliver. So, will you please tell him that Baby Huey sent me? Okay. - 'Theatis.' - 'What?' 'Theatis, there's someone here to see you.' 'Who is it?' 'I don't know, somebody Baby Huey sent.' 'Who?' What the hell is this? My house or some goddamn cabaret? Well, what do you want? Yolanda tells me a Baby Huey sent you. You don't know who I am? - You don't. - Don't what? Know me. Fuck, man, I already know that. Now, what's going on? I made a mistake, brother. Okay, I'm sorry. Mistake about what? It doesn't matter. What's the shit about all this noise? - It was loud. - Where do you live? Oakland. Told you it was loud. That's very funny. Now, let me tell you something. I don't dig no strange dude come busting in my house. Now you better tell me something? Now you're a big cat, Oliver. But don't try and sell me no wolf tickets, man. Ow. Daddy. Cool it, mama. - There's people.. - Get out of here. Get out, now. [Theatis] 'Freak.' [jazz music] [music continues] [music continues] They came back, huh? No, Tyrone. I'd just been doing my nails. Hard to say. You know, I get my butt kicked for a perfect stranger and not a word of kindness. Well, put it on the bill. Where's Sherwood? He dragged him out of here...and they hurt me. Oh. Well, you're lucky, 'cause they kill too. Baby Huey nearly died laughing. That lyin' sucker. What about Sherwood? I mean, what's he gonna do? Look, Sherwood's got a whole lifetime of taking care of himself behind him-- You know, you're real one. You're real bastard! I don't know where he is. You know where he is? Well, forget it then. Suppose I phone the police and tell them there's this dude living in my motel who's planning to put some holes. But you wouldn't do that 'cause then I'll blow you away. Listen, I've been threatened before. I know how you like your men. Proud and erect. 'You ain't the only one who fits that description.' But I'm the only one here. Give me a dime for a phone call and I'll fill this room. I ain't got no dime. Oh, Tyrone, be careful. [giggles] Oh, Tyrone. Alright, Jesus.. I got love, T'one. [chuckles] Come on. Tyrone. 'What's shaking, Ty?' You're getting in some strokes, brother? Man, cannot I get a moment's peace. Orders is orders. Biggs wants you back in Oakland. And you cats will not take "no" for an answer, man. Nita misses you. Now look, we know what's got you steppin' in shit. And everybody's sorry about that. But that's gonna be spread cool, Tyrone while you still got some friends here. Well, put me on the plane, man. Maybe, we'll let him get his gun off first. [gunshot] How was that, brother? Zito says, all the trouble you cause reflects on him. He ain't burn no more. I wish he'd say that before somebody offed my brother. Get your head out of your butt, man. Now, we're gonna take you back to Oakland...sooner or later. - Dead or alive. - Head up, funny guy. Take that honkey with you. Damn. You're not leaving again, are you, Tyrone? What am I supposed to do? Sit here with my finger. Proud and erect, baby. [knocking on door] Sherwood. Sherwood, it's Tyrone. - Sherwood. - 'Kiss my butt.' 'Ooh, Sherwood, they sure kick your butt?' [mumbling] - Say what? - I.. Oh, my back. Man, they walked all over you. No shit. - You knew they'd come back. - No, I didn't, brother. Any word on Julius Swift? Somebody said he's feeding animals. Feeding animals? Jesus Christ. What the hell happened to that guy? What's this? You wrecked it already? Well, keep 'em. 'I got a healthy insure.' Well, I hope you got yourself heavily insured anyway. You poor baby. you see, Sherwood, that's just what you get for messing with that young stuff. Get out of here. [laughing] - Hang tough, buddy. - You, too, man. [mellow music] [tiger roaring] [speaking in foreign language] Hey, baby, is Julius Swift around? No, I haven't seen him all morning. He's supposed to be here. Can I help? No, that's cool. Oh, if you're looking for Tablo village it's behind the barn. Tablo village? What the hell is that? It's a mass, I see, in a building. Julius got some actor friends, they're in it. Well, I'm one of the Igbo chieftain types. Have you known Julius Long? Yep, since she was about, maybe, that tall. [roaring] Wow. Thank you, baby. Yeah, at the funeral, Rochelle was acting real strange. Very cold, I mean, I could understand. I know where she was coming from with that stuff. How well you know Rochelle? Said "hello" a couple of times. Hello, brother. How about some flowers? - Yes. - I'll take this one bunch. - Okay. - Alright, there you go. - Thank you, brother. - Hey, thanks. What was happening with you and Cornell? - You know, what were you into? - Hey, man, he was good to me. - And that's all? - He's better than most. But nothing heavy, huh? Just wanted little low light weight street thing, right? - Man, you know what I am. - Yeah, I know what you are. So? And I'm good at it, too. How come you all spent so much time together? Because Cornell dug me. Cornell wasn't ashamed to be seen in daylight with me. Hey, dig it, Irvelle-- Look, man, it was nice to have a life outside the house. We had a groovy thing going. I'm just trying to find out what was bugging the dude, that's all. Cornell wanted me to move away from Candy, Lilly, and move in with him. He raised holy hell outside that place. If they found out I had some side bets going.. Girls have been killed for that. So I told him I couldn't see him no more. That was Sunday. He said he was going to kill himself. I didn't believe it. I ain't working, Irvelle. Now, you're gonna tell me something else. 'Cause that is not where Cornell's head was. - I'm the freak in the family. - But it's the truth. - Bullshit. - Honest. Look, you two-for-nickel jive street-time whore. Cornell was too hip to get off like that. Now, tell me who killed him? How you doing, playboy? Zito's pretty pissed at you. Oh, yeah? Had to tell Murray about you fooling around with his mother. You know, you lyin' for brown helmet. Get in the car, punk. I tell you two guys one thing. Zito or Biggs or nobody craps on my head. Got that? Get in. [dramatic music] [tires screeching] 'Hey, Tyrone.' Hey! [music continues] [gunshot] Just made number one on my list. [gunshot] I'll be damned. I've to say, the man's got talent. Well, if anymore people follow me around they gonna have to get a parade for me. Aren't you the lucky one? I just might be getting lucky. 'Where you taking me to?' Close your eyes and see. [sniffing] [soft music] [Tyrone] 'Who catches the rent around here?' Theatis Oliver. Is he coming here? Umm-hmm. He wants to see you at his new theatre. But first, I just had to kidnap you. I'm thinking, what happens if Zito finds out that Oliver's keeping you. He won't. He thinks I'm just a dumb girl. Oh, we really get to that behind that porno thing, huh? But only when I play the lead. Oh, yeah? You're an actress. The first act is coming up. [music continues] - Well, what is this? - Oh, wait a minute, you'll see. - Theatis. - Tackett? - Thanks for coming, man. - What's happening, Oliver? Oh, man, nothing's happening. You know. Really appreciate the fact that you could make it. Say, hey. Man, come on, let me show you around. - You wait here, babe. - Alright. Well, man, this is it. Out of the porno, into the big time. This will be the showcase of my theatre chain. Nothing but first run. Hard ticket. Well, man, how do you like it? Well, you've got somebody to, uh.. ...close all these drapes for you? [Tackett] We'll only be opened at night, man. You know. And if the customers don't dig the picture they can sit around enjoy the city. Tackett. Yesterday, after you left, I did some checkin'. Since you weren't opening up. Seems like your concerned about your brother's death. Concerned? Yeah. I think you can say that, Oliver. Now, I was thinking, it would be nice if the, uh, dudes that you're tracking down are the same catch that's right in my butt. You know my life, Tackett, it's.. This porno shit it's a nice living. I mean, it takes care of itself. Not much of rough stuff until lately. Shit, man, I ain't no gangster. I don't want no war. Hell, no. But I gotta get to them before they get to me, man. But you know the trouble is, Tackett if I blow it, man, I'm dead! Tackett, five grand belongs to you. Along with the name I'm gonna give you. Name of the man who...killed your brother. Give me the name. Nano Zito. 'Oh, my partners.' - Hey! - Oh-oh, your partners. I don't see more muscle in this town than that and I ain't impressed with them. Now, what I wanna know, man, is how come Zito hit Cornell? All I heard is that, they were sweating piss at Zito's place Saturday. Your brother's name came up. Next day, he was dead. But why? He wasn't into nothing. I don't know, that's all they told me. Well, it's not enough, Oliver. Jesus, man! I mean, I, uh-uh.. Look, just because he turned me on to you don't you try the same thing, man. Well, you're wrong, man. When all you underworld characters and heavy dudes start shootin' you let me know. Meanwhile, I'm going to the mattress, brother. Come on, baby. 'Hey, wait a minute, man.' I'm telling you, it was Zito who killed your brother! Hey, Tackett! How come your going the scenic route? I'm parked over on 107. I got a surprise for you. Coming attractions. [door buzzing] My favorite customer. Wow. I don't have to pay you.

That man is hung. What's the matter? Don't this turn you on? Maybe Murray Biggs would like to see it. I can get a print. ♪ ...Young blood.. Hey, what's the matter? But you didn't see the last of it. What's the matter with you? Tell me about that girl. What girl? Young blood. I don't know, man. She's just some kid from the streets. Was it Julius? I don't think so. What about Oliver, he make that film? No, he just shows them. Well, who makes them? Zito. Making films gets him off. Who set it up? Shag? Then he pulled the girl. Can you tell me what's going on? Did my brother, Cornell, find out about that? Find out what? What are you talking about-- You lyin' brat. Tell me the truth. The-the girl's name is Rochelle. You know her last name, do you? No, no, no, I don't. It's Tackett. Same as mine. Tackett. And her fight with my brother.. ..was killed because of all this! Get in your Limo. Go on, get your butt up there. Damn you. [jazz music] [music continues] [gunshot] Tackett. - Put that gun down. - Don't mess with me. You're about the only one left, Laurel. [elephant trumpeting] [Female #??] 'That's a good girl. Come on.' Where's Julius? He's in the elephant shed. Come on. You'll be next. [elephant trumpets] What's happening, Julius? Hey, Ty. Hey, I didn't know anything about Rochelle. I just thought she was some hot pants brought off the street, you know. 'She act cooler, huh?' 'Yeah.' How? He knew her well. 'Oh, when did you find out who she was?' - Couple of weeks back. - How? Oliver. He saw the flick, and he wanted to know about her. So you told him, huh? 'Yeah, I did.' Who killed Cornell? Last Sunday, Shag and a couple of his boys came by her house with Cornell and...they said he was pissed. 'Somehow or other, he got to see the film.' And he was talking about death. They asked me for some whiskey and started to force it down his mouth. I-I thought they were just going to mess him up, you know. What did you do, Julius? What could I do? Did Shag know that Cornell is my brother? Yeah, I told him. What did he say? "Good." Then they drove away in his car. And that's how my brother died, huh? You know, me and Cornell looked up to you, Julius. I mean, man.. ...you were it. 'Education, out front, making it, you know.' Now, you're just here, feeding elephants in North Africa. [elephant trumpets] [dramatic music] [music continues] Get out. [sobbing] You about to play your biggest scene, actress. Now, you can run.. ...or I'm gonna shoot your face off. [music continues] [screaming] You shouldn't have showed Cornell that film, man. That would make him mad enough to kill Zito. But instead, he killed Cornell! I didn't mean for that to happen. I just wanted Zito. Then they killed Rochelle. Shot her in the head. But chicks like your bullshit bourgeois daughter can do anything they wanna do. 'Cause you got the bread. Ain't that right, Oliver? But the Rochelles of the world coming from the streets end up dead or huffin' or hookin'. Let me tell you one thing. That shit is got to stop. Come on, move out. Move out or I'll blow your head off. Christ, Tackett! You're not a killer, man. Put the gun down, huh? I'm over here at the Dove Valley theatre. Get here right away. It's important. Right. [door bell rings] Where's Irvelle? She's with the girls at a private party. Nano Zito bought the whole place out. I gotta use the phone. [telephone ringing] [ringing continues] [ringing continues] Yeah? Mr. Zito says it's time you boys found another business. [Tyrone] 'Zito.' [laughing] [people chattering] Telephone, Mr. Zito. Hello? Who is this? [Tyrone] 'This is Tyrone Tackett.' And I'm hip to what's been going down. Oh. Quiet! 'It's a simple deal.' 'There's only one cat I want.' 'Call it straight, okay?' What do you want? I want Shag. Signal Street. Turno island I think it could be arranged. But I don't want them there before 6 o'clock in the morning. 'Why so early, Ty?' Well, I'm catching the...early flight back to Oakland, Mr. Zito. Done. Kiss my butt. Shag. Did you shut up the kid? Cornell's? Personally. Good. I got an early delivery for you. I want you to go home and get some sleep. And I think we'll try and carry on without you. Yeah, I know him, Mr. Zito. Any idea where I can find him? I'll be there. - She home? - Hmm? Oh, yeah, yeah. [intense music] [grunts] [gun firing] [screaming] [firing continues] Ah! Aah! What the hell's going on here? What do you want? I got cunning boys working for me. I'll give you money, all you want. I'm Zito. Nano Zito. Give me a break. Please. [Zito] 'Oh, God!' Shag. How about a drink, old buddy? [jazz music] [gunshot] [music continues] [panting] [Tyrone] You're getting tired, fat man? [music continues] One last drink to my brother, Shag. This is how you made Cornell take it? huh? This is how you made Cornell take it? What are you killing me for? How many 16-year-olds did you pull over the Biggs brothers, huh? You know, they had fathers and brothers too. You ain't dead for pulling her, you killed her. - No, it wasn't me. - My brother too. I didn't kill him. Nano Zito did it. Look, you know how mighty Whitey is. He set me up. Come on, man. Hell, I didn't do it. I got some for Zito. I got some for worth, guinea. You're diggin' it, huh? You got the taste of blood, huh, animal? Huh? You know, what you ought to do you oughta take the gun and stick it in your mouth.
