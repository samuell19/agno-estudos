You Tube - Video Running Time 02:21:45 You Tube search name - Sikandar 1941 Long live Aristotle! Long live Aristotle! Long live Aristotle! Long live Aristotle! Why is the Emperor's seat vacant? Seleucus, I want to know what work Alexander finds so important... that he doesn't even have time to attend to my proclamation. Alexander has not told me anything. - Juminees, do you know? - No, respected guru! But this wise man knows everything. You are his teacher. It is the world's biggest misfortune... that when the most important matters of state are to be discussed... he, who appreciates such matters the most, chooses to be absent. Cancel this session. We will not discuss business today. I may please be excused for speaking... but we're waiting eagerly to hear something from you. You want to listen to my proclamation? But where is Alexander? Rexrees! Rexrees! Your Highness, I'd like to once again humbly state... that my name is not Rexrees, but Rukhsana. Maybe, but once the Emperor takes a liking to something... he gives it a Greek name. As long as the Emperor had not seen you, you were Rukhsana. But the moment the Emperor laid eyes on you... and the Emperor took a liking to you... you became Rexrene from Rukhsana. And what about you, Your Highness? In Greece, I was Alexander. But Iran has made me Sikandar. And you're not upset with Iran for this? Upset? Why should I be upset? Iran has given me a beautiful damsel like you. I thank the Emperor. Alexander does not like this old way of saying thanks. Come here, come close to the Emperor. Place your fair arms around my neck. Look into my intoxicating eyes with your intoxicating eyes. Bring a radiant smile to your enticing lips. And when I am thus totally driven crazy by you... then tell me, in a beautiful and bashful voice... "thank you". The Emperor will accept this "modern" thanks. But, Your Highness... now say "thank you". Thank you. I swear by God, your grace and mischief add to your beauty. I have prepared something for Your Highness with my graceful hands. The Emperor will appreciate it. I praise anything made by your graceful hands without even seeing it. Rukhsana wants to hear praise for her, not from your lips, from your eyes. So should I bring it here and show you? Do I have your permission? I'll take that as a "yes". A "modern" thank you! - Rexrees! - No, Rukhsana! Rukhsana! See, I've called you "Rukhsana". So are you happy now? But if you come before me again, I'll still call you "Rexrees". What a beautiful name it is! Who's come to meet me now? Tell him I cannot meet him. Your guru Aristotle is here. My guru! May the Gods give you a longer life than the Sun and the Moon! I've come to tell you something. Do you have time now? I can never be so busy... that I do not have time for my guru. My son, may your fame spread as far as the winds blow. Is your mind free of the thought of women at this moment? If not, then clear your mind right now. Otherwise your mind will not be able to receive words of wisdom. My mind always has room for whatever you may have to say. Then listen to me. I have only come to say that... if you wish to conquer the world, you need to first win over your own mind. And if you wish to win over your mind, then stay away from women. A woman is the biggest weakness of man. He who gets entangled in the world of women, gets destroyed. This isn't something I've just made up. This is a lesson taught to us repeatedly by history. He who heeds my words, will live the immortal life of the soldier. He who does not heed my words, will live in darkness like a common man... and die in anonymity. The beautiful creation, of my beautiful hands! Forgive me, but I cannot stay for long. Who was he that was here just now? What will you do, knowing his name? I will try to understand what important work it was... that had to come between your love and my pleasure. That was my guru, Aristotle. And what did he tell you? He said, "He who would conquer the world, should stay away from women". What else? He said "A woman is the biggest weakness of man". Nonsense! A woman is a man's biggest strength. He who wants to conquer the world, should have a woman by his side. Without a woman, a man's life is incomplete. She completes him. You have spoken very well. I ask for my reward. And my reward is that you sit here. And drown your guru's advice in just one glass of my house wine. That will be difficult to do. What will be difficult to do? You are the Emperor. You're the Supreme Commander, you're the Nikator, you can do anything. To the world I may be the Emperor, the Supreme Commander, the Nikator. But in front of my guru, I am like a child. If Aristotle wishes, he can make any number of Sikandars... but even if a thousand Sikandars try their level best... they will not be able to make one Aristotle. You have refused my wine! You had given me this wine to drown my guru's advice in it. But there was one other thing he said. Do you have a strong enough heart to listen to it? Your lady has got a heart of steel. He said "He who gets entangled in the world of women, gets destroyed". Now tell me what you've to say to this. I have to say that your guru has insulted the role of women. He has insulted the maturity of women. He has scorned the world of women. And I, an unknown and insignificant woman, will give him a fitting reply. I will tell him that his age and stature have no standing in front of women. He thinks he is above everybody, nobody can make an impact on him. But I will prove that his reputation, earned over a lifetime... can be ruined by just one glance from a woman. You are crazy. My guru is above all this. But he is a man. And every man has a heart. I don't believe he has a heart. And if he ever had one, it is now dead. A woman can bring a dead heart to life. Please do one thing. Just stand by your window tomorrow morning. And when I clap my hands, come over to your guru's garden. Then you'll see that picture of your guru that you cannot imagine. Awake! Beauty approaches Arise and open the door Look at me... say something Smile a little... sing a little Bring some color into your life You are lucky, it is your good luck that... your house is blessed with... flowers and youth Awake! Beauty approaches It is time to drink nectar It is time to live your life Eat a little, drink a little Live a little before you die How often in a still pool... do you get a new lease of life? Awake! Beauty approaches Who is this spoiling my garden? I... I'm Rukhsana. Rather, instead of saying you've spoiled my garden... I should say you've made its flowers more beautiful... and its air more fragrant. You are not Rukhsana, you are a fairy tale. So I am a fairy tale? No, I made a mistake. You're not a fairy tale. You are the dream that the youth of this world dreams. You are the song of love that sings to beauty. You are the story that the spring tells in the ears of the flowers. When I was young. Or, to be precise, when the world was young... there was a woman of your age in Greece. When she laughed, the entire world lit up. When she spoke, the Spring could not muster words in response. She died. And with her, my love died. My heart died, my dreams died. And, in my young age, I became old. Can a man become old in his young age? Yes, he can become old in his young age... and become young in his old age. And today I feel as if it's not you who's come to my garden... but as if Spring's arrived in my old age. Don't get startled, woman. I will give you everything in this world. Tell me just one thing. Will you be able to love me? In other words, you will not. Like others, you also only look at appearance. You don't look at the heart within. If you cannot love me, why do you come in my path? To tell you the price of my love. Tell me, I'll pay even the price of the stars in the sky for it. Are you really stupid, or are you trying to make a fool of me? No sane person will ever do this. This is impossible. Pity! You couldn't even accept this token request in the name of love. But what will we achieve by this? Okay, where's the harness? I accept this childish demand of yours. The world is surprised when it sees my horse. This sturdy horse of mine, which I dote upon. Come on, move. Come on, move. Come on, move. - Show me some speed in your feet. - Rukhsana! "A woman is the biggest weakness of man." "He who wants to conquer himself, should stay away from women." Guru, please leave. This woman doesn't deserve to stand anywhere near you. You are wondering what happened to your guru. This woman is happy she's gotten the better of me. But I say that if a woman can fool a wise old man like me... then what can she not do to a young man like you? Old age is colder than ice, youth is more red-hot than the embers. Old age is wise and experienced, youth is impulsive and inexperienced. Old age observes and thinks, youth observes but gets impatient. I can only pray that the Gods above give you eyes to see and ears to listen. Just think, if a woman can get an old man drunk on wine... what magic cannot she do on a young man? This incident isn't a defeat for your guru. It is a lesson for you for life. Always keep this in mind. It will serve you well all your life. You are mine. And I am yours. But until I have conquered India, I will not appear before you. Please bear one thing in mind. Peace of mind comes not from war or victory, but from peace and love. May the Gods protect us! Your goal is to conquer the world. You go on ahead, we'll head back. But I will need your advice every step of the way. I have given you whatever advice I had to give you. There was one thing remaining. You needed to know what a woman is capable of doing to you. Today I've told you that too. Now nothing more remains to be told from my side. So have faith in the Gods now. Every country in the world is waiting to accept you as their leader. May the Gods protect us! Seleucus, give the army its orders. By God's grace, we will attack India. Life exists because of love, let it be spent in love At the feet of beauty, give up your heart... give up your life Life exists because of love Life is but one night, and love is the light of life Let the light burn for as long as possible Partake of the brightness Life exists because of love, let it be spent in love Life is a garden, love brings color to it Add some fire to it... and drink it down Life exists because of love, let it be spent in love Life is a gamble, don't look at it from afar Step up to it, and put your life on the line Smile even if you lose Life exists because of love, let it be spent in love Life is a passion, live it with passion Be the emperor of your life Take over the skies Life exists because of love, let it be spent in love Long live Alexander! Long live Alexander! - Long live the King! - Long live India! Tell me, what is the news? Sikandar has crossed the Sind. His army is now coming this way. - How big is his army? - More than 100,000 strong. And King Ambhi didn't try to stop him? I have heard that he's decided to surrender to him. So as soon as the fire heard of the water, it extinguished itself? Did you hear that, Prince Amar? Maybe he wants to take Sikandar's help to attack us? He who doesn't try to protect himself... will not even get protection from God. When even the gatekeepers have colluded with the marauders... what becomes of the house? If the inner doors of the house are strong, there can be no damage to it. And the inner doors of the house are strong, Father. Have faith in us, we will win. Until now Sikandar has only seen those who covet life. He has not seen those who value self respect. Rest assured, each one of our soldiers will take on four of theirs. If this is true, then even Brahma cannot defeat us. Commander, you go and prepare for battle. Minister, please send invitations to the kings of Abhisar, Salkot and Kulut. But will they come? Why won't they? After all they are human, not stone. Write to them that a foreign force has attacked our country. If we don't unite and face up to this enemy, future generations will call us cowards. And our country will be ruled by a foreign king. A foreign king should not be allowed to rule over our country. Prarthana, you are my sister. You should think of my welfare. And you are King Ambhi. You need to think of your country's welfare. Whatever I am doing is for the good of my country. No way, you're doing nothing for your country. You care only for your life. He who cares only for his own life, cannot do anything in this world. So what do you suggest I do? Join hands with King Puru and take on Sikandar. That is impossible. Then join hands with Sikandar and cut Puru's throat. And make India a slave country. Why do you care so much about Puru? Because he's brave, and is willing to lay down his life for his country. But he is our enemy. And he is a threat to our country. If, joining hands with Sikandar, we get rid of this thorn forever, what's wrong? There was once a fight between a horse and a lion. The horse was weak, the lion was strong. A man told the horse "I'll help you". The horse was happy at the offer of help. The man said "Take me on your back". The horse obliged. At that time somebody remarked, "You fool, the lion will lose if it has to". "But you've lost even before the battle's started". And you can see for yourself, to date the horse is slave to man. And to date, the lion is king of the jungle. Those who went for grand glory, did not even retain what they had. Do you realize what you are saying? I'm only saying this deal you're carving out will prove very costly for you. I don't care how costly it is, I will definitely go through with it. When you're hell bent on selling out your country and its freedom... then from today, we are not brother-sister anymore. Goodbye! But where will you go? To Puru? Yes, I will go to him. Aren't you ashamed to leave your brother and go to his enemy? When the brother is not ashamed to go to lndia's enemy, Sikandar... why should the sister be ashamed of going to lndia's friend, Puru? You try to make India a slave, I will try to keep India free. Long live Alexander! Long live Alexander! What is this noise about? The king of Takshila, Ambhi, has accepted our terms. - And his other friends? - They too. The Emperor is happy to hear this. Make offerings to the Gods. Your Highness, they have sent a load of presents for you. Long live Nicator Alexander, long live Nicator Alexander! Send them also Greek and Iranian gifts from our side. And, send them a message... to come and receive their reward as soon as they can. They will be presented at the earliest. Juminees, today we've secured our first success in India. Today I am happy, and I want to share this happiness with my men. So distribute all the presents amongst the men. And make sure our laborers do not get left out. The time you take to get groceries from the market... a person can go to Iran and back. Excuse me today. Today I'm not going to excuse you. You've done this too many times. - Then give me some punishment - I won't. I leave that to your mother. My mother will not punish me today. - Why not? - Today is Raakhi. If you notice, everybody is singing, dancing and enjoying themselves. I'm also going to join them. Goodbye! Wait, wait! I will also join you. - Nobody will mind, I hope? - If anybody minds, I will handle it. The days of monsoon are here Buy me a veil Every house is playing music Buy me a veil How long will I wear this old veil? - My beauty wilts in it. - Alas! Buy me a veil The days of monsoon are here Buy me a veil Every house is playing music Buy me a veil The new stole accentuates my beauty The red stole brings out my color It makes me look desirable Buy me a veil The days of monsoon are here Buy me a veil Every house is playing music Buy me a veil The gardens look beautiful My mind is filled with love My beauty calls out to you Buy me a veil The days of monsoon are here I am worried. When the world celebrates this season... eyes are on you, too The days of my youth have passed With it my love has also gone Who will bring back my lost time? I am worried The days of monsoon are here Buy me a veil Every house is playing music Buy me a veil Your dress suggests you are a foreigner Your face says you are tired. Sit down Should I get you milk? Would you like some sweets? If you could bring some water, that would be a big favor. And if I get you milk, would that be a small favor? What's the occasion today? Today is the day we celebrate Rakhi in our country. Today is the day sisters tie a rakhi on their brothers' wrists. And brothers give them gold and silver in return. And what about a girl who doesn't have a brother? Whoever she ties a rakhi to, becomes her brother. Oh, the festivals of India! They make me "hoppy". Not "hoppy", say "happy". You're crying in vain and spoiling your eyes. I know you don't have a brother, but who can force the hand of God? Indeed, who can force the hand of God? He chooses to give some and not to give some. Just look at our King. He has seemingly everything, but no sister. The King does not have a sister? And even our princes have no sisters. And you have no brother here. That is why we'd like you to tie rakhis for the princes. They'll get a sister, you'll get brothers. As you say, Your Highness. Then go quickly lest the princes look the other way. Till today we had only sons, from today we have a daughter too. A daughter is the pride of a home. What home is that, where there's no sound of a daughter's anklets? What home is that, where there is no loving tiff between brother and sister? Long live the King! A foreign woman stands at the doorstep. - She desires an audience with the King. - Let her in. Why don't you show me what you've brought me? I've told you a hundred times I will. Please sit down there. Okay, here I am. Seated. Thank you very much. Now tell me what you've brought me. The King and the Queen told me to tie rakhi for the princes. So I've brought a rakhi with me. Then go ahead, tie it. Tie it yourself. Why should I tie it for you? Then what will I tell the King? How should I know? Say whatever comes to your mind. Who, Amar? Come, brother. If I may, hearty congratulations! Congratulations? To me? Shouldn't they be for you? For both of us. I don't know what you're talking about. So should I explain to you, big brother? Congratulations to you for getting a wife. And to me for getting a sister-in-law. You cannot fool me today, big brother. Today I'm saying it, tomorrow the whole town'll be talking about it. So you are daughter of that country where King Dara was ruler? He was a friend of mine. I regret that I could not come to his aid. Tell me, what can I do for you? I have brought a gift for the King of India. And hope that the King will accept it. I'll accept your gift with pleasure. Then show me your hand. You are scared? No, I am just thinking. What's there to think about? It's easy to become brother-sister. But it's not easy to honor the essence of this relationship. Then please think it over. But please don't forget that I've come all the way from Iran. And I've come with the hope of making the King of India my brother. Okay, go ahead and tie it. - From today you are my brother. - From today you are my sister. Today you've tied a rakhi for me for the very first time. Tell me what I should give you in return. I haven't made you my brother for gold or silver. In the country of Iran, I have everything I need. Even if the sister has all the world's treasures... it's the brother's duty to give her a gift on the day of rakhi. Tell the treasurer to arrange a thousand gold coins and a palace for my sister. A palace? The King's sister cannot live in an inn or a charity home. What's my sister thinking about now? I am wondering that you never even asked me why I've come here. The brother's conscience says: "Don't ask such questions, you're Indian". And the sister's conscience says: "Tell him immediately. You're from Iran". Then let the sister speak, the brother will listen. I've come here with the intention of preventing any harm to Sikandar. Are you regretting what you've just accepted? No, I'm just surprised. If you want, I'll remove this right now. When you tied this, you became my sister. Now by removing it, you cannot become a stranger. Long live the King! King Totu. King Virbahu. King Ambhi. Greece. The Emperor believes all have got their share. Thanks to the Emperor's kindness, nobody has missed out. You lied to me. I notice that the two of you haven't received anything yet. You will be punished for this lie. And your punishment is... this sword for you... and, this one for you. But the Emperor hasn't kept anything for himself? I've kept for myself that which cannot be found in all the treasures of India. I swear by God, our Emperor is really the son of Jupiter. Seleucus, what did Puru say? I wanted to tell you about that tomorrow. - Why not today? - Today is the day of victory. For Nicator, every day is a day of victory. Tell me what his reply was. - May my life be spared. - Your life will be spared! Puru has said: "I'll see you on the field of battle". Jemenees, reserve the best presents of Greece for him. I like those who accept my terms. But I respect those who challenge me to a fight. I respect a man who knows how to fight in battle... but I worship a man who knows how to die on a battlefield. No doubt a man's life is to live... but sometimes moments arise in a man's life... when he becomes immortal in death. And when he escapes alive, he no longer lives. Today that moment of reckoning has arrived. Sikandar thinks we're small and weak, so he's attacked us. But has he given us a reason for attacking us? He says, "I want the entire world to bow before me". And what about those who refuse to bow before him? He says those countries have no right to exist. He has fire in one hand, and a sword in the other. And every country that defies him in his path, is razed to the ground. Many countries have accepted defeat, many have been destroyed. Now it's our turn. And he stands at our doorstep and asks us "What's your stand?" King Abhisar? I believe that honor and bravery is not the preserve of one man. He has no right to threaten or bully the rest of the world. The King of Kulut, what do you prefer? A life of subjugation or an honorable death? I want a life of victory. - And you, King of Salkot? - We will fight. - And you, King of Pashpat? - We will win! But it would be a mistake to underestimate the enemy. He is Sikandar. He only knows to win, not to lose. If we have God with us, we'll teach him how to lose. We'll teach him such a lesson that he'll not dare come this way again. But King Puru, you haven't shared your views with us yet. My view is that if anybody is becoming a threat to world peace... and wants to bring everybody under his own control... then it is the duty of every man to challenge him. Your view is completely correct. Please go ahead, we are all with you. Then come, let's bury our differences for now. Let's forget our domestic issues, our problems with each other. And let's first tackle that man... who wants to destroy our peace in his quest for world sovereignty. If we stay united, then we will live and be victorious. But if we don't, we are assured of death and defeat. May He give us life and victory! May our country win! India is our home India is our world We are the birds of this land This land is our garden May our country win! Its feet are adorned by golden Lanka Lakes adorn it like a pearl necklace lts beauty is unique and enthralling At the crest is the crown of the Himalayas May our country win! Awake, God of War! Awake, be alert! Raise some fearsome storms from our land Give us your courage Spread our zeal across the land Oh God! May our country win! God, You are our Father! It is all in your hands Show us the way, light a flame It is a dark night tonight You are our one support May our country win! Holy Fire, what can I ask from you? If I ask for Sikandar's victory, it will mean defeat for Puru. And if I ask for Puru's victory, it means defeat for Sikandar. Puru is my brother, Sikandar is my beloved. So I ask you to spare both their lives. Save the honor of both. Let both of them return without losing face. May our country win! May our country win always May the world sing our praises The whole world will learn from us... how to live and how to die Our story will live on forever May our country win! It's been two months... and not even one of our men has been able to cross the river yet? Seleucus, I want to know the reason for this. Your Highness, may your fame only increase! But there has been a delay. You call this a delay? The Emperor considers this his defeat. No opponent has ever held out for so long against me. Jemenees, what do you have to say? Your Highness, this is the season of rains. Don't try to hide your weakness using rain as an excuse. It's not the rain obstructing us. It is the army of Puru that isn't allowing us to progress. As long as I'm alive, there's no need for you to worry. Your forces will advance. The Emperor is pleased to see such a show of courage. And when the Emperor likes something or finds something beautiful... he calls it by its Greek name. Till today, you were King Ambhi. From today your name will be Amphis. I will respect the name given by the Emperor. So Amphis, is this Puru really all that brave a man? The Emperor thinks that before going to war... he should see firsthand how Puru rules his country. After the battle, he may well escape but his country will not. - But Nicator... - No ifs, ands, or buts. Your Nicator wants to see who this man is... who is made of such rock and steel... that he refuses to be cowed by storm or cyclone. Men of such steel aren't born everyday. In many centuries, one such man is born. Juminees, make arrangements. The Emperor has decided to cross the river. Rexrees! Today your Nicator is going to meet lndia's bravest man. If only you'd been here, I'd have taken you also with me to meet him. Attention, everybody! The King's procession is approaching. You who with a kind heart... we hail everything you do. You protect the honor of even the poor... the poor of the land hail you. We hail your name, we hail your deeds. We hail your throne, we hail your kingdom. May you be blessed so, dear King. May your rule be hailed in all three worlds. May your rule be hailed, may your rule be hailed. Bring the Greek envoy to the court. On behalf of Nicator Alexander. We welcome you. - Do I have your permission? - Yes, you do. Nicator Alexander wishes King Puru health and well being. The King is informed that the son of Jupiter, Alexander... has set out to conquer the world. But his kind heart does not wish to see blood spilt in vain. That is why he wishes that King Ambhi and his allies... surrender to Greece, accepting its terms... in the process, saving their respective kingdoms. In the same way, if you also accept Alexander as supreme ruler... then your rule and power will be left as they are now. You have only to pay an annual fee of 200 elephants... 2,000 Indian swords and 20,000 gold coins. In return for this, Alexander gives you the assurance... that there will be no interference with your rule. Rather, if a third force attacks your country... Alexander's substantial forces will protect you. Messenger, go tell your Emperor that... till now he's only seen Indian swords. Now he will see Indian warriors too. My Emperor has extended a hand in friendship towards the King. This is not a hand in friendship, it is a hand claiming victory. He wants us to be like slaves on our knees, kissing his palm. And he, like the master, pats us on our backs. Puru has only known to have others bow before him. He does not know to bow before others. So what should I go tell him? Tell him he has insulted me. Our reply to this insult will be with our swords. I would like to once again suggest with great respect... that the King consider the implications of his decision. You are exceeding your brief, messenger! But I forgive you. Minister, send two rotis made of gold and pearls for Sikandar through the envoy. Rotis of gold? Others hunger for rotis of maize and millet. Your Sikandar hungers for rotis of gold, silver and jewelry. If this weren't true, he wouldn't go about destroying the entire world. Dear King, you are insulting my Emperor in front of me. But when you are face to face with my Emperor... you won't dare insult him in this manner. Whatever I'm saying, I'm saying in front of your Emperor. What's this you are saying? I am saying that before me is not a Greek messenger... but Sikandar himself! Can you deny this? No, I do not deny it. You have sharp eyes, I compliment you on them. We have very sharp swords too. When I get to see how sharp they are, I will compliment them too. But right now, you should be praising me for my courage. That I chose to come to your court. And if I tie up your courage and throw you into a cell, then what? The world will say Puru had a sharp eye, but not a brave heart. And if I give orders to kill you... won't you regret your courage goading you... on to the biggest mistake of your life? If you kill me, you will be the one regretting it. That you have deprived this world of its bravest man. And have you considered what the world will say if you get me killed? You are anyway destroying world peace. To satisfy your own selfish desires, you are destroying the whole world. Wherever you go, you take devastation with you. If the world doesn't object to your deeds, why should it object to mine? It'll say "Puru killed Sikandar when he was but a messenger in his court". "This was a sign of his cowardice and weakness". When Sikandar, without reason... kills innocent citizens of Iran, Egypt and Gandhar in their own homes... he is called brave, courageous, and a Nicator. And if Puru, to protect his country's honor and freedom, punishes the culprit... he becomes a coward? This may be justice in Greece, not in the rest of the world. After all, what has India taken of yours? Have any of us snatched your bread, your clothing, your self respect from you? Or have any of us curbed your freedom? If the answer's no, how do you justify trying to make India your slave? The Emperor who dies without expanding his kingdom is no Emperor. And the Emperor who allows his captured enemy to walk away free? All I know is that for so many to attack one person... is such injustice that no country will approve of it. Not even your India. And is there any country... which will approve of Sikandar's attacks on small and weak countries? Is there any country in the world which will say... that deploying Sikandar's army of 120,000... against Puru's army of 30,000 is an act of bravery and valor? Will you tell 90,000 of your men to step aside? That only 30,000 of your men fight against 30,000 of mine? While fighting Dara, did you bother to check whether... your troops didn't number more than his troops? If you didn't care then, then why protest now? When your gambit worked, you killed your enemy. So when your enemy's gambit works, he will kill you. Then give out orders. Everyone in your court has a sword. I would've gladly accepted your request. And I would've shred you to pieces, feeding you to the vultures. But unfortunately you have come as a messenger. Commander, give Sikandar due state protection... and see that he crosses the river. Your Highness, my intervention be excused, but politics tells us... that letting go of a captured enemy is the same as accepting defeat. But Indian politics tells us that he who has come as a messenger... should be treated only as a messenger. You can go, Emperor, you are a free man. We will now meet only on the battlefield. And I hope that you will not be a messenger at that time. And I'll also not be alone. King Puru, I have never paid salute to anybody to date. But you are a brave man and I salute you. Good bye, Greek Emperor, goodbye. Bloom, beautiful flowers Spring is here Nature has whispered this in the ears of rosebuds... "Bloom, bloom" Bloom, beautiful flowers. Spring is here Everything about this season is beautiful The days are filled with songs, the nights with stories In this young, evergreen world... there's green everywhere today Bloom, bloom Bloom, beautiful flowers. Spring is here The towns, paths, jungles, gardens are fragrant The very sight makes me sing aloud Everybody's forehead is being kissed by... the blessing of youth Bloom, bloom Bloom, beautiful flowers. Spring is here Prarthana? Prince, what brings you here at this time? Sit down, Prarthana. I want to say something to you. But now I'm wondering whether I should say it or not. Then please first ponder on this. The thing is Prarthana, that nowadays I see a dream. And that dream is very pleasant and sweet. I've discussed this dream with the King also. - You have? - And he said... "Go tell her about whom you have this dream". Okay. You've understood what this dream is? - Yes. - So what should I understand then? Nothing, Prarthana, you have to give me an answer. - I will not. - I say you have to. Ok, then you sit here. Here I am. Seated. Now close your eyes. Ok, eyes closed. - And don't open them until I tell you to do so. - Okay. Prarthana! Prarthana! - What's the matter, Amar? - Nothing, Mother. Mother knows everything. You keep quiet. You are the younger one. Oh God, in my next birth let me not be the younger one. Everybody who wants to, just bullies me. What did she say? Yes or No? Crazy boy! He's too shy to talk to his own mother. Mother, you can see a smile on his lips. That should tell you enough. There's no need to ask him. In other words, "yes". I had told the same to the King earlier. The girl's like the moon, the boy's like the sun. It will be a good match. Son, you should not now see too much of Prarthana. - That is our tradition. - Say "As you wish, Mother". There's a thief in the garden, the gardener sleeps Beware of these thieves They are everywhere The gardener sleeps There's a thief in the garden, the gardener sleeps Other thieves look for darkness They lurk in the shadows These garden thieves are daring For them the night is... just like the brightness of day The gardener sleeps There is a thief in the garden, the gardener sleeps Other thieves steal silver... gold, diamonds, precious pearls These garden thieves are dangerous What to say of gold and silver These take even your mind and body The gardener sleeps There is a thief in the garden, the gardener sleeps Jasram, do you know who Sukhmunia is calling "a thief in the garden"? What do I know? I care about eating the fruit, not counting how many grow on the tree. Fool, why do you ask this young man? Ask this wise man, I'll tell you all you need to know. He has gone grey but he has can still pack a punch. So who is the "thief in the garden"? If Sukhmunia sings this, she's referring to Jasram. And if my wife sings this, she's talking about me. - That's a lie. - That's the truth. Why do you fight over it? Just ask Sukhmunia. The garden is India. And the thief is the Greek Emperor, Sikandar. He has come to destroy our peace. And our people are just sleeping. And here was Jasram, thinking she was singing him a love song. He who sings a love song in these difficult times, commits a sin. And he who listens to such a song, is also a sinner. You've made a very profound statement, Sukhmunia. Forget your home and its comforts. And march ahead to protect your country. May you live long! Take an oath you will sacrifice your life but not your country's honor. You don't worry. I'll give up my life for my country. That's easy to say. Let me see it in action. The storm is still some distance away. Let it come closer. Then see what we're all capable of. We've covered part of the distance. A small part still needs to be covered. This is a sign from above, that the time for waiting has now passed. Today is the day to cross the river. Attention! The enemy should not cross the river! Attention! Attention! The enemy should not cross the river! Attention! Attention! The enemy should not cross the river! Attention! Attention! The enemy should not cross the river! Attention! This light should be burning all night long. The soldiers should be on alert all night long. So that the enemy is distracted... and the Emperor, with half his men, can travel 20 miles and cross the river. Attention! The enemy should not cross the river! Attention! Attention! The enemy must not cross the river! Attention! With the river like this, who has the courage to even step into it? Attention! The enemy must not cross the river! Attention! There, an enemy arrow has greeted us. Long live Nicator Alexander! King Amphis, now your Indian troops will be in front. Long live Nicator Alexander! Indian soldiers? Indian soldiers? Trust me, this is the army of King Visarg. Amar, take 2,000 men with you. If it's the army of King Visarg, welcome it. If it's Sikandar's army, fight it. I have confidence in both your bravery, and your intelligence. Wait! Such a big army! These aren't Visarg's men, these are Sikandar's men. Let them run. We will chase them and finish off every man. They are more in number. But we are brave. We will fight. Pray and before you die, kill as many of the enemy as you can. We are lucky. They are themselves coming in the line of our arrows. When they come, give way. When they are in, surround them. And mind you, not one man should escape. This is our first battle this side of the river. Amar! Amar! Amar, my son! Who says that Amar is dead? In his death, he has only attained immortality. And I am proud that he was my son. He has protected my honor. He has proved to be a worthy son of his mother. He has protected his country's honor. I see that all of you are in mourning. But remember what the prince said... and go to the battlefield in good cheer. May God bring you back in good cheer too. I know you are his mother. But what's the point in weeping? Weeping only causes us to become diffident. And right now what we need is courage. Promise that you won't cry. Ok, I will not cry. I will not cry. He was our enemy. He has killed many of our soldiers. But he was brave. If he'd wanted, he could've tried to escape. And if he'd tried, he might've succeeded. But he chose to be brave and put his life at risk. I salute him. Give me your wishes, that I may prove to be a worthy son to my mother. My brother, I am very worried. I wonder what will happen today. I wonder who will win, who will lose. Victory or defeat is just a game of life. One shouldn't obsess too much about them. It is our duty to fight with the full strength of our body and soul. And leave the rest to God. May God protect you. May God protect our country. Prarthana, pray for my brother's welfare. His welfare is more important than the country's welfare. If he is there, the country will be saved. If he isn't, the country will also not survive. In front of the country, a king is nothing. If the country is saved, it will find more kings. If the country loses, the kings will become slaves. I like what Prarthana says. Her love for me has made a coward of my sister. And I know the reason for this cowardice. My sister is concerned about Sikandar also. Prarthana, I am going to war. And anything can happen in war. I may return in the evening, celebrating a victory. Or maybe tonight's moon doesn't get to see me, it sees my dead body. So if you have any desire, tell me now. I will fulfill it. My only desire is that you rid the country of its enemies. I will honor your desire. Now what does my sister want? All I want is that the purpose of my coming here from Iran... should be satisfied. You mean Sikandar should win? No! I don't care about victory or defeat. I only want Sikandar to be alive. I give you my word that Sikandar will not die at my hands. Why won't he die? He who has attacked us without cause... he who has killed my brother Amar... he who has killed 2,000 of our soldiers in one night... he who wants to defeat us and make us his slaves... he whose eyes are on our dignity and our wealth... he who is a destroyer of peace and has taken many innocent lives... why should he not be killed by your hands? You want to know the reason? Look at this. This is the rakhi that Rukhsana has tied for Puru. But if you look at it carefully... you'll see this is the rakhi that Iran has tied for India. I regret that India could not come to lran's aid. But Puru will definitely come to the aid of lran's daughter. So this means you will deliberately make your country lose? He who deliberately causes his country to lose, is an animal. Rather, calling him an animal is an insult to animals. Prarthana wishes that I fight for the country. I've assured her I will sacrifice my last drop of blood for the country. Rukhsana wants Sikandar to remain alive. I've assured her too that Sikandar will not die at my hands. Now you tell me, what do you want? I don't want anything... because what I want, no power on earth can give me. Sarita Rani, be calm. May God give you life and victory. Rukhsana, you did not apply paste on your brother's forehead? The battle has started. The time for talk is over. Father, the time for battle has arrived. Give me your permission. I give you my permission. Go, serve your country. I will take care of myself. Mother, give me blessings. May you get an arrow here. Not here. All you soldiers, today once again you are being put to the test. With fire in your hearts, revolt in your eyes... pray to the Gods and advance further. Let it be written in indelible print in the annals of history... that the world was meant to fall at your feet. In the skies, Jupiter is with you. On Earth, Jupiter's son, Alexander, is with you. Long live Nicator Alexander! Long live King Puru! Long live King Puru! Long live King Puru! My men of steel, you are sons of those brave men who knew how to fight... but did not know how to run away from a battlefield. You belong to that country... that has never allowed its honor or flag to be compromised. And today an arrogant foreigner comes to you and tells you... to compromise your flag, otherwise he'll destroy you. If you want to save your and your country's honor... if you want to respect the honor of your ancestors... then march ahead with the full strength of your body and soul. Even if you die, make the enemy retrace his steps. Show the world that you know not just to live for your country... but to die for it too. Turn back! Shahru, advance! Keep moving forward, don't turn back. If we turn back, there's only death for us. "I give you my word that Sikandar will not die at my hands". Long live Nicator Alexander! Long live Nicator Alexander! Long live Nicator Alexander! Long live Nicator Alexander! Congratulations to the Emperor. We have won. I am pleased. Go bring King Puru to me. We thank the gods in the skies who helped us again. And we once again came out true in this test. The Emperor respects the bravery of every single soldier here. But more than that, he respects those brave... who are not here today to celebrate. But their spirit is watching us even from the dead. And happy at our victory. Victory to Greece! Victory to Greek soldiers! Victory to Greek martyrs! Long live Alexander! Long live Nicator! Your Highness, King Puru is here. Sikandar acknowledges his brave enemy. So, now you realize Alexander's strength? It took him only a day to win victory over you. Not through strength did you achieve victory, but through deceit. If you were so strong, why didn't you cross the river in daytime? All's fair in love and war. Then is it also okay to kill an emperor disguised as an envoy? You didn't do me a favor. You had confidence in your own capabilities. And that turned out to be a mistake. If I make this mistake a million times and am made prisoner... if I get another chance, I'll still make this same mistake. I have seen many rulers... and also defeated many rulers... but, I swear by Jupiter, I've never seen a ruler as brave as you. I have also seen many emperors. And also defeated many emperors. But I swear on the name of my arrow and my sword... I've never seen an emperor as vain and shallow as you. Speak with respect. You are talking to Jupiter's son and the world's conqueror. Who are you? Don't you even know... that when two kings speak, it's an insult to them to interupt? Had you been in my court, I would have dismissed you for this. And told you to first learn the protocol of royal court proceedings. Seleucus, what you did wasn't right. Your Highness, I am sorry. I am happy at your outspokenness. So tell me... how would you want to be treated? Like a king should treat another king. Anything else you want to say? Whatever I had to say, I've said in my earlier reply. Write these words of King Puru in gold, and preserve them amongst my treasures. When I return to Greece, I will show the people of Greece... that the world contains even such people who may lose in war... but do not lose their courage. People who do not bow their heads down, blaming fate. And whose sons fearlessly walk into the throes of death. King Puru, I acknowledge that you are a brave man. So brave that no power in this world can make you bow before it. I'm letting you go free. I let your soldiers go free. I let your country be free again. In addition, the area near Hydaspes that we captured will be returned. Seleucus, tell the soldiers to step back. But will we still be subjugated to you? In India, you will be my biggest friend. And in the annals of Greek history, your name will be Porus. For the second time, I offer you my hand in friendship. In return, Puru offers his hand in love. Long live Nicator Alexander! Long live King Porus! King Amphis, you did not cheer King Porus? I do not want my friends to be enemies with each other. You also should say "Long live King Porus!". Long live King Porus! Long live King Puru! Long live King Puru! Long live King Puru! This is a splendorous night, my love I could stay awake every moment of this night I could die for this night When do such nights come along? This is a splendorous night, my love In this silvery night, I burn I walk on the streets of azure Sweet nectar fills my body This is a splendorous night, my love In this silvery night, songs bloom Dreams are being made in the silver gardens What a beautiful, clear, and pleasant night this is This is a splendorous night, my love Your husband has returned from war. Welcome him with traditional honors. What is this you're mumbling to yourself? I am praying to God that... in my next birth too I should get a brave husband like you. Ok, I have accepted your prayer. In your next birth also, I will be your husband. Come on, let it be. Who welcomes an old man with traditional honors? Even if a man is old, he is still his woman's husband. I do speak to you in a loud voice, it doesn't mean I fight with you. Brothers, today the honor of our country and our king has been saved. This is an occasion for celebration. Light up lamps in every household. Wait a moment! Had this really been a happy occasion... the palace would have been glittering with light. But I have just been there. Both outside and inside the palace there is complete darkness. What is the reason for this darkness? For a defeated soldier, darkness is his biggest reward. But you have not lost. This is your victory. That's what you say. But I say this is as good as my death. Rather, it would have been better if I had been killed. At least the world would not say that Puru was defeated. He who says that Puru lost, is blind. In that case, the whole world is blind. Using this logic, the generations to come will also be blind. Because they'll also read history books and say that Puru was defeated. History records what happened out there in broad daylight. It does not record what happened in the darkness of homes. Apart from me, who knows that you'd extracted a promise from Puru? That promise prevented Puru from killing Alexander when he had the chance? History will only say Alexander won and he let Puru free. You are right. This is all my fault. I was also a big fool, to make such a promise without a second thought. So is another promise being made here or what? You go away from here. I don't want anybody to see my disgraced face. And it's alright for Rukhsana to see it? Rukhsana can see it, because she's the one who's caused this disgrace. Tell me what I should do. I'm willing to do anything. I've committed a grave crime against you. - Now you're saying it. - So far only Puru has been defeated. In a few days, the rest of India will also be defeated. Sikandar's forces will keep advancing and capturing India. That will be the end of lndia's independence. That will not be the end of lndia's independence. That will be the end of Sikandar's bravery. The people beyond the river Beas are not as foolish as I. They will fight the Greek army tooth and nail. It is also possible that Sikandar is killed in battle there. But I've heard that, seeing your bravery... Sikandar's army has refused to advance further into India. The soldiers have refused, but Sikandar hasn't, has he? Sikandar only has to give them a short motivational speech... and they'll regain all their enthusiasm and energy. Sikandar will think of that as his victory. But this victory will actually turn out to be his defeat. He will not cross the Beas! He will not cross the Beas! He will not cross the Beas! This mad woman says, he will not cross the Beas. But he will cross even the Ganges. Who will cross even the Ganges? My Amar, who else? Have you forgotten Amar so soon? You are the father, you can forget him. But I am his mother, I can never forget. It is true that we are soldiers. It is also true that soldiers do not refuse to follow orders. But soldiers also have eyes. And those eyes see. And based on what they see, they tell us the truth. Nobody should be blind on purpose. We are not blind. We are not blind. But we are being blinded. Do we realize that Porus has wiped out half our troops? And weakened the resolve of the other half. If you search among your brave men, you'll find a fear of Porus. And it is not just we who fear Porus. Even our Emperor fears him. Otherwise he would never have reconciled with him. It is indeed true that Porus is no ordinary man, he is a god. Remember all that he said that day in the court? Nicator Alexander swallowed all that. We've been told that 40,000 of our troops have been sent back to Iran and Greece. But I say this is the biggest lie in the annals of Greek history. These 40,000 men have been killed in the war with Porus' men. And our Nicator is hiding this truth from us. This is very true. I have seen with my own eyes, when our court was in progress... the bodies of our men were being burnt together with those of Hindus. And now we're being told... that 40,000 soldiers have been given leave to go home. Are we to understand that tomorrow when we are killed... a plaque with our names will be made and will say "these were given leave"? All this is fine, but what can we do? We are weak and powerless. Who says you are weak and powerless? You have won for Sikandar every single battle of his. Who says you don't have an identity of your own? Sikandar derives all his strength from you. Who says that your voice will have no impact? Sikandar cannot walk one step without you. Tell him you are tired of this life of spear and sword. Tell him that your hearts now yearn for peace. Tell him your families are calling you back home. Tell him you will not advance further. We will not advance further! We will not advance further! Send us back home! Send us back home! We will not advance further! The time for rest and relaxation is over. We need to resume our mission. - King Amphis? - Yes? How are you going to help me? My army and I are both at your disposal. I am pleased to hear that. It is what I was expecting. And King Porus, my friend? What about you? I'm afraid you are not going to like my answer. So is the king not going to help me? The king is my friend! I am your friend only later, I am first a son of this soil. Bravo! I am disappointed in your answer... but I respect your patriotism. I will pray for your life, for sure. - And not for my victory? - No. Because your victory means defeat for my country. The man who prays for his country's defeat, or helps in such cause... is no man, but an animal. In fact, he is worse than that. Because even an animal does not pray for its own defeat. Puru, you've insulted me. I challenge you to a sword fight. I'm glad that my neighbor's blood is not entirely water. Wait! You are my friends. I don't want you wasting your energies fighting each other. King Amphis, I'm going to ask you something. And you know I don't take no for an answer. And I don't know how to say no to you. I want you to get your sister, Prarthana, married to King Porus' son, Samarpal. - So you agree? - Who can refuse Sikandar's request? Then put away your swords. You are related now. Seleucus, tell the men to get ready. We will now advance. We will not advance. We will not advance. We want to go home. We want to go home. Send us back home. Send us back home. Long live Nicator Alexander! Have the rules of loyalty changed today? You cannot even wish me a long life today? The Emperor has always heard only shouts of loyalty from you men. But today the Emperor senses revolt and disobedience. I do not take kindly to disobedience. What do you want from me, after all? Tell me, what do you want from me? We don't want anything, Your Highness. If you want nothing, why are you assembled here? We want to go home. Say "I want to go home". We want to go home. Yes, we want to go home. I now realise for the first time that I've got a bunch of weaklings in my army. Being miles away from home, they've forgotten their duty towards their country. We know our duty. And we have always fulfilled our duty. But it's been fourteen years since we left home. Our families wake up each morning with hope that we'll return that day... and go to sleep each night, disappointed. We have a responsibility towards them too. So, with great respect, we request that we be allowed to go home. To tell your families that you've returned home as failures? We are not failures. We've fought wars. And won them. Who says we have won wars? These are the people who the Emperor is proud of. These are the men whose names will be recorded in Greek history for posterity. My brave men, just think... When you left Greece, you were just a stream. Today you are a splashing river. And if you keep advancing like this... tomorrow you will be an ocean. You won victory over Iran. You won victory over Turan. You won victory over Egypt. You won victory over Babul and Gandhar. And now, when on the verge of winning over the land which grows gold and silver... whose oceans have pearls... whose forests have sandalwood... whose soil has saffron... when this land is ready to fall at your feet... a land which even the sun and moon envy... then love for your home has suddenly developed in your hearts? This love for your home is just another name for cowardice. Get rid of this cowardice. And rekindle that spark of bravery in you and say... "We will advance further". But what is the point in advancing further... when, after fighting Porus, we've come to realize... that beyond this, we've even stronger enemies to deal with? So should we advance only to be annihilated in this foreign land? And there not be anybody to even mourn our deaths? Are we to advance only so you can build your palaces on our graves? Why should we, thousands of men, sacrifice our lives... to satisfy this crazy ambition of yours? Because you are soldiers. And it is the duty of every soldier to listen to his superior's orders... and follow the orders. So have we not been following your orders? Haven't we been facing up to death every single time on your orders? Haven't we been sacrificing our lives, winning for you half the world? Do you want even the wind now to blow only with your permission? Do you want even the river now to flow only with your permission? Do you want the whole world should surrender to you? But Your Highness, the world is a very big place. No one man, however great, can be master of all elements of the world. Fear the wrath of the god of the skies, Jupiter. You are offending the son of Jupiter. We don't want to offend the son of Jupiter. All we want is to go home. We want to go home! We want to go home! Then go! And tell your families that... you've left your Nicator behind in enemy territory. So that he gets disgraced and dies in anonymity. Till today, I have never faced defeat from anybody. But today my own men have defeated me. Juminees, what will the world say? What will the annals of history say? What will future generations say? But I have decided on one thing. Go, prepare the offerings for my father, Jupiter. If he accepts the offerings, my soldiers will come with me. If he does not, I will also go back with them. Let the world see it as if my father, Jupiter, refused me. My father, Jupiter, must save my honor. Father Jupiter, your son Alexander wants your permission to advance further. Give him a sign through Nature. Alexander! Father Jupiter is not happy with you. He has rejected your offerings. You cannot proceed! - Rukhsana! - Your Highness! Long live Nicator Alexander! Alexander, in front of father Jupiter, you've embraced this woman. So, according to the laws of the gods... she is your wife and you are her husband. Long live Alexander! Seleucus, let the wish of father Jupiter be respected. Divide the troops into two battalions. One will go back with you via one route. The other will go back with me via another route. Life exists because of love, let it be spent in love At the feet of beauty, give up your heart... give up your life Life exists due to love Beauty is here in its prime This moment is priceless I am singing now, you should sing too Let us sing together Life exists because of love, let it be spent in love At the feet of beauty, give up your heart... give up your life Life exists because of love Life is for one night, embrace this darkness Be like the moon, and spread moonlight everywhere Serve everyone the nectar of love Life exists because of love, let it be spent in love At the feet of beauty, give up your heart... give up your life Life exists because of love So what if you made a mistake, forget what happened yesterday. All's well that ends well, so just sing along today Play the flute
