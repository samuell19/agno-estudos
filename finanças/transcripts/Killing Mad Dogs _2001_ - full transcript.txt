Lissar Film Group Presents KlLLlNG THE RABlD DOG KlLLlNG THE RABlD DOG A film by : Bahram Beyzaie Why so late, Nasser Moasser? If I were you, I'd run. You scared me to death! Isn't it enough That you missed up my life? Why are they after me now? They came back? They're always asking about you! Your relations with the big shots, Your background... Why should I pay such a price For your shady past, Gavad Moghadam? I've broken with all of them! You know that! What about your wife and kids, Who are abroad? Have they done anything wrong? Of course not! How should I know? I have to ask them. Must you walk in front of the window? Police? Damn! I've dug my own grave! They'll recognize me. I gave them your old address And phone number. I said you were abroad. Leave that alone! Is it tapped? Why do you think I came here in the middle of the night? You shouldn't have come! You were to send word Via the secretary or caretaker. And have witnesses in my file? They can easili trace you. Everybody knows your Range Rover. You'd have done the same! I panicked. I went through the side streets And lost them. In the phone box. I won't wait any longer. I'll stay at the office. If I can sleep at all... We can escape through the back door. Why is the door open? Eivaz! What's wrong? Caretaker! You see! They've been here, too! You weren't to go in till I came! You took ferever! I took a detour. Don't you understand? I had to lose them because of you! You shouldn't have touched anything. What should we do? You're asking me? It's one partner of the company Asking the other partner. Who'll answer for all this? So they questioned the caretaker, too. Probably the secretary who knows The accounts. I'm thinking of the one following me. Following you? You went calmly out the back door, ... but I had to drive the car with no lights! So... they'll come after you here. I've... got nowhere else to go. No... That's enough! Leave the car. Take me home before they find my address! Why didn't I bring my money and passport? Let's go back! We may not have another chance! Do you think they'll have questioned The secretary? Don't say anything. Just drive. You shouldn't have touched anything. If she hasn't been in touch, It means they've raided her house. Should we give her a call? Right now? It doesn't matter! Just find out... What they've been asking her! What if they're still there... Or on the line? Have you forgotten? Just 5 minutes. Javad Moghadam, won't escape justice! Even in here, in our bedroom! Bastards! They asked about you... Only about you! Have you gone crazy? It might be my children! It might also be the people you're running from! I can't take it anymore! Take me to a phone I can speak from! So you can run off and leave me? So I should give myself up? If you were smart, you'd come with me. Nothing can stop me now. I know a trustworthy middle man Who'll get me over the border. Tonight! Taxi! Taxi! Where do you want to go, lady? Private car to rent! Exuse me, Are you Mrs Golrokh Kamali? Should I say yes, or no? I'm Khavari. I'm here on behalf of nasser moasser. Damn! It's changed a lot, hasen't it? What? Tehran! Where is he? Who? Nasser Moasser! Probably in his clothes! You said he sent you? By phone. He phoned an hour ago in a panic Begging me to take you to the hotel. Hotel? Why a hotel? You mean he's there? Look, you've trusted me so far. He said : Send someone you can trust. I thought : Who's more trustworthy than me? Here. Khavari, car dealer. He came to my showroom To sell his Range Rover. There he was! My old school friend. Those were the days... He ran the show in our neighborhood. So he sold the car... It was a wreck, a write - off. I took no commission. Just what was due the company. It's good you didn't see his downfall. Downfall? Whose downfall? My lips are sealed! Why this way? There's the house! The house? You passed it. Which house? You mean you don't know? Don't tell me the house...? My lips are sealed. What's happened to him? Stop a minute! You idiot! They bought it furnished? What do I care? How could I not recognize my own things? Officer! It's not mine, anyway... So, you mean... When I thought of friends, Especially old friends... I felt sorry for Nasser Moasser's misfortune. It's very hard to see someone like him give up. Think they'll let a single woman stay at the hotel? That's not necessary. Your lD. I didn't know it was so easy. Everything's arranged, Mrs Kamali. Mr Moasser called himself. Really? Not a half hour ago! I'd prefer my own house. I really would. This is your house, too, Madam. You'll see. No. 603. Mr Moasser's very own room until yesterday. Give him my best regards. You have my card. I'm just a call away! Breakfast, lunch and dinner hours. Whatever time he calls, put him through. I'll be awake. Golrokh Kamali It's me in 603. No news from Mr Moasser? Sorry, it looks like he's here! Yes? From Mr Nasser Moasser. Is there no message? Hello, Father. It's me, Golrokh. Yes, I got in fine. Very good. Did you call? At home? Seem the number's been changed. You know how numbers in Tehran are forever changing. Me? in a hotel. Why? Why in a hotel? Hello... What can I say? Actually, it looks like we're moving To a nicer house. We're in the process. I'll ask hom when I see him. No, I haven't seen him yet, ... but I trust him. I can feel him in this room. I think I should never have doubted him All this time. Yes, as you always told me. I remember. I'm sick of my stupid, stubborn behavior. I spent a whole year apart from him for nothing. Closed. I thought you knew. I haven't worked for him for 5 or 6 months. How come you didn't hear? I was politely asked to leave. To tell you the truth, Contrary to what people thought, ... Mr Moasser never held a very high opinion of me. There was a kindof distrust. I later heard he went bankrupt. He's in a bad way. I heard his partner ran away, Leaving him with the problems. It's not serious, is it? Such a respectable partner! I didn't look for another job. I'm getting married soon. Oh, really? I hope you'll come. Of course, of course. I'll be happy to see you in a white dress. Is it all prepared? We might go to Europe. Oh, I'm very happy for you, Fereshteh. You deserve it. To tell you the truth... It's so hard to say it... I feel I must apologize for misjudging you. Really... what can I say? I didn't know I could be like that. It's over. Don't upset yourself! I made you suffer. You were entitled to be angry. I was very stupid. I turned his shortcomings into other things. Can you forgive me? It's in the past. I behaved badly. I regret this year apart. But it wasn't your fault. Maybe it was. Things might have been different. Don't blame yourself! I should, I should... Maybe now he needs help, It's a chance for me to make up for it. Yes... I definitely will... Golrokh Kamali Do you have a map of Tehran And the suburbs? I think you need the top - of - the - range model. How about this? You'll be like a bride! There's a full tank. I don't understand. It's already been paid for? By Mr Nasser Moasser himself. Sign here. Here are the papers : tax clearance, Fine clearance, safety inspection. A martyred people... I don't understand... Is baghestan far from here? Baghest... what? For God's sake, Eivaz! Where the hell are we? Did you tell anyone the way? Mr Moasser wrote that I musn't. What's all this hide - and - seek about? Stop here! I had trouble finding you. " Follow these direstions to Eivaz. only he know where I am. " Well? Where's your master? Does the car have a horn? What happened to him? Scram! 750? Million! I've only ever dealt with double figures. Six zeros? I'd have trouble even writing such a figure! How could you count such sums? We borrowed it fot something substantial. To get into the world market, To break the monopoly. At least, that's what I thought. But he'd thought of the outcome from the start. I was an idiot, not to realize his schemes Until after he'd gone. And no one's after him. Stupid me! I even helped him, ... spent sleepless nights, put myself on the line, ... for a partner who, when the time came, had the cash in his pocket! I heard he's gone over the border, Laughing at the world, ... while I'm here at the mercy of people who are ten times stronger than the two of us! How you've suffered... Sorry for shouting. What's the solution? Suicide! I got to that point once. Only one thing stopped me : What you'd think of me. " Suicide of a con artist " The papers would say. Maybe a photo of my body. What would you have thought? You've always doubted me! Don't make me more ashamed than I already am! Damn me! I must give myself up before they put me in jail for illegal currency transactions... ... or involvement with foreigners. It's better this way! For how long? There must be another way! There's only one way : Someone buys the checks back And gets the complainant's approval. You think so? But how? Do you think I sold the houses, car, land And company shares for nothing? I wasn't complaining. Those checks will be worth nothing if I'm in jail. They should be grateful If someone comes and buys them, for 10, 15, 20 % Who can I trust not to go over the border Like that monster? Do you think I could do it? You're the only one I can trust, Golrokh. But I couldn't bear it. It's a hard job! Seeing you in jail would be hard. It's very hard! The harder it is, the better! I'll make it up to you. - Really? You're really prepares to do it? It'll be rough. You'll have to be very careful. Keep your wits about you at all times. I won't be there to help, But I'll be thinking about you. At the same time, you're my last hope. You'll really do this? Without any experience, without help? Don't be fooled. You must be very strong! This is the list of debtors and all their details. Hadji Agha Naghdi, Sangestani, Sabouri, Montaseb, Afrandi. Still got your old current account? From tommorrow, in 3 transactions, ... the rest of the cash will be paid into your account. All I could earn, which is less than a third offer as little as possible. You have to learn to keep count. It's different from writing! It's me in 603. Did you get through to the provinces? I've been waiting for a long time. What? Hi, Dad. Is that you? Did you phone me or did I call you? No, I'm not surprised. Are you Ok? Yes, I saw him. In good form, as usual. Listen, Father, I'm going back to my writing. I need information about chacks, Promissory notes, and so on. The subject? What's the subject? Bankruptcy! No, he doesn't know. I wanted to ask someone who's experienced it. Will you tell me? Hello, It's me. Write this down. There are 60 Kilometers on the clock. Return journey. So, we have to take it as 30. Not allowing for the detour she took, Trying to lose us. Thank you. Not at all. There was also a telephone call to the Provinces that I didn't understand. I'll tell you in person. Legally there's no way. Can you put forward His movable or immovable assets? ( BAD DEBTS ) You can read, can't you? " If accepted, the court has to sell at a fair price and as far as is possible, pay the debts of the debtors in order of priority. " is that clear? can you do that? don't push! sir! There's nothing you can do. You're not the first or the last To have a bounced check. You really should consider yourself lucky That he gave himself up. You can't do a thing unless you withdraw Your complaint. His being in jail is of no benefit to you Other than wasting time. Can you show assets of the same value As your debts? Or even less? Nothing? Be glad you don't have to pay his jail costs. This is totally absurd! No, sir, Legally there's no way out. Say what the court wants to hear. They've made some enquiries. No, sir, it's not our responsibility! I'm Guard Naghmeh. Stand up straight in front of me. Or shall I get them to show you how? That's better. Be a good boy while you're here, and we'll get along fine. I'll have to look at your file. You don't seem to have a record. Mr. Montasab... I wanted to talk to you about a check... It was from Nasser Moasser. It's about buying it. My best offer is 15 %. I left a message at your home a few minutes ago. Mr. Montasab, I wanted to discuss a check... Out of my way! you ruined me! - Don't go up there! Ieave him alone! Iast will and testament. Women in lslamic dress only. Why are you here? Get lost! - Flowers? How kind! You're to blame for his suffering! - She mean well. God help me! - Please, please... Be quiet! If we hadn't saved him, Who would've been responsible? Who'd have answered me? I trusted my brother - in - law To invest my savings wisely, ... but he was stupid and gave it to some swine. Damn those who take advantage of misfortune! That's not fair. - Why not? Nasser Moasser signed the backs of Those checks. If I find him... The real culprit is his partner Who took all the money. Someone who takes so much money Doesn't leave any traces. You're right. He's left ... his partner's address instead. Where are the police? You put nothing for me in your will! Who's going to pay the hospital bills? I will. Are you worried about your debt? My creditors are more worried about me than my heirs. I messed with my heirs' shares, And now they hate me! It's all over now, thank God! There's good news : This woman's come to buy the check. She shouldn't have! I had 100 people arrested, And now they want to arrest me. Why did I trust others? My only solution was to hang myself. - The solution is to accept 15 %. If I were you, I'd accept! My dear boy, ... You're just concerned about your share, not about my honor! You didn't tell him about the risk, brother. I don't want to be part of your suffering! This covers your debt, but what about me? Do l, after 30 years, go back to square one? Looking to others for hand - outs? Only 15 %? Let's say nothing. I'd be a second - hand dealer after a whole career. Do you have another solution? - You wouldn't have hung yorself! They wouln't be behind the door With an arrest warrant! The investigation clearly shows ... that he doesn't have any land, house or capital. Therefore, all your money is completely gone. Better to get some back... At least half! My last offer : a third! - Agreed! It's hard to write off two third of the money. It's easier than writing off all of it! My pills! A third, right? One third of such a huge sum is better than nothing! You know I have no choice. This is the account number. How do I know you'll return the check? You have to trust us. You trust me and give me the check first. Put down that you don't object. I've trusted once, that's enough. Let's go to my bank together. I'll write out a check in front of you. Once you know it's bankable, You return Nasser Moasser's check ... with a letter of acceptance. Do you agree? Let me die! - Later. Give me the check and witten acceptance first. Don't waste any time, Montasab. How would you like the money? On this account. - How long will it take? 10 minutes. They're waving to you. You don't need me anymore. I'm sorry, we can't shake hands. Want me to take you home? - No, thank you. Don't you have to pick up your money? Don't forget to sign it. It's a pity. A real pity! Tear off the signature. Tear off the signature... If you continue at this rate, I won't be in here for as long as I thought. Was it hard? Well... I can imagine. It's all new to you. When needs must... It's easier than being in jail! Damn him for getting me in this hole! I'm telling you now... The day I get out, you're in for a surprise... How nice! I'm starting tolike this job! Yes, it's for you. Who from? A tall, well - dressed man with dark glasses. I think there's a note inside. - Thank you very much. " From someone who worries about you. " Yes, thank you. Put it through. Hi, Dad. It's me, ever the nuisance! How are you? I wanted to ask if you had sent me a present. No, anything I ask is for my writing. The title? " KlLLlNG THE RABlD DOG " Didn't I tell you? One year, the council was rounding up Stary dogs, ... Ones they suspected of having rabids. Do you remember which year it was? Just a moment. Let me get the document I wanted to read you. I'll check something... It's important. It might take a while, though. Can you hold? Right... What's the problem like? Can you hear it? My book... Have you read it? I was a teacher once. You're kidding? In literature? If there's any problem in my book do tell me. The problem is my being cautious all the time, ... but ... your heroine faced danger all the time. Oh, Father! Is she brave enough to face danger Or is she afraid of nothing? Of course she is afraid, ... but she's in a situation where everything she does is dangerous. Yes, and that is the problem. Dad, I'm very sorry. I checked it. My guess was right. Father, who would know more about going Broke than you? The son of a bitch! Wait till he gets out! He'll be begging at stalls. It'll be a pleasure to see him suffer! The acceptance letter, complaint waiver... Not so fast! I won't retract my complaint! To see him suffer, he must be out of jail! Hey, boy, get the tea and bring it here! He spoke about dealing abroad. I trusted him, Recommended him to lost of places. He was supposed to work with me. Nobody'll trust him again ... unless he gets into making counterfeit goods, but not in my field! How did you get the money? - The same way as you! I earned it honestly! - Well, so did l! Business? - In the provinces. Which field? - confidential. Where did you get this money from? - Has anyone ever asked you that? I'm suspicious of you! Did he send you himself? I am his wife. I'll do anything to free him! - His wife? He didn't mention a wife! You thought otherwise? None of our business maybe we were wrong. I won't go to the bank, nor accept cash! - Only a valid check! What we agreed! - Whatever's possible! Whitout cheating! On either side! Is this approval letter ok? Yes, it's clear enough. If you give me the check... He can't do business anymore, At least not in my field! I'll let him get out of jail for one reason only : To take my revenge! What's you doing? You won't find it in there. It's here. Count them. How dare you? What if didn't return the check? - I'd call my bodyguard. Bodyguard? Where is he? - You needn't know. Give me number 12. There was a click. Somebody is thinking of us! Regarding the crossword, I am working on it. They didn't accept your new story's characters. Get rid of them as fast as you can. I don't understand... Tomorrow I'll see 5 and 7. 3 is over. 4 is hesitating. but I was never any good at math! check out this guy's file. I want to know what his crime is. What's been reported? - A fugitive. He was seen at the port. I want letters of acceptance from everyone. Anyone who hasn't already might complain tomorrow. ... or the complaint's on its way. I want the original check and approval, Signed on headed paper. Hello! your goft arrived. What? Which gift? Nasser Moasser guessed it must've been you. How is he? I want to visit, But they said only next of kin! If it wasn't you, then who was it? I don't know what you're talking about! I want to be able to hide something under this seat. Is that all? Hide what? A briefcase. I won't charge you for this job. Hey, boy, come and take Madam's car. Are you happy? - Yes. It's a good car. I meant my dear friend, Nasser Moasser. How could I be happy when he is in jail? I want letters of acceptance from everyone. Anyone who hasn't already might complain tomorrow, ... or the complaint's on its way. I want the original check and approval, Signed on headed paper. I won't talk to a woman. Tell your man to call. Pardon? I won't deal with stupid woman. Send your man. May this never happen to you. Mr Tajvardi passed on a few days ago. I am his lawyer. At your service, how can I help? Who wants to talk to me? She has no right, and nor do you. I said, I don't speak to women. The check you specified is part of the inheritance And should ne cleared. Of course, ... it's in their best interests to come to an agreement, ... particularly as the signatory is bankrupt, and everything is out of their reach. What? I do have things to say, but not to a woman. Find a man to speak for you. Isn't there a man you could send? Fortunately, it was never registered. The only advantage of this useless Piece of paper ... is that it increases the tax on the inheritance. All right... ok. I'll speak with the inheritors and I hope We can have an urgent meeting. Speak. Is that you, Hadj Naghdi? I'm here on behalf of Nasser Moasser. May l? All right. Forget it, he won't see you. Go in. But I spoke to a man. What a miracle! A goft from God! Get out of here! Out! Out! It wasn't my fault... Who gave you permission? That's no way to speak to a lady. Be polite. Please forgive his rude behavior. Go back to your work. And be careful! There's a man who buys dead checks In case they " come back to life ". I work for him. - You said it : " dead ". Who has benefited from these complaints so far? A return of 30 % is a good deal... To be honest, I can also overlook the 30 %. But it's not here. I keep it at home... - How can you be sure? In a 10 - lock safe. Reset assured, the key's here. But you know, regarding my inheritors, A second key is with Mrs Mashdi, ... the children's mother. she keep it with her at all times. So why doesn't a woman like you come and work with us? The salary's no problem... Whatever you're earning, we'll double it. A woman can be useful in certain aspects of Our work. Selling graves, for example. We do the men's, you the women's. With or without headstones, lndividual or family ones... At pilgrimage sites or pleasant locations, Cash or installments. Buy in bulk - sell at a profit. - It's way beyond me! You just need some expertise, It can't be taught! What is it about? We buy in bulk. Big amounts. No. Why bother with raw materials, ... the daily costs of workers, insurance, a factory, storage costs? I make one phone call and it's done! I don't even see the things I'm buying and selling! But seeing the goods isn't a bad thing, I won't deny it! Thank God for all the good things he created! I want a letter of approval. So I see. Otherwise I can't get a buyer for the check. Sohan, nougat, baklava... Who the hell told you to come in? You said approval? Here it is, on your headed paper, Just waiting to be signed. How dare you use my headed paper! She asked for headed paper To write a letter while sha waited. Wonderful! Let me praise this handwriting... And your hands! Bring in some tea and sugar! A signature means nothing to me. It's just a sort of scrawl. Hadj Naghdi's credibility is his seal. Do you think I would keep it In these broken old drawers? This is a place to negotiaie. If you want the seal come to my house. But you know, women, jealousy and all that! Have some sweets! Regarding the check, I'm vacationing by the Caspian sea, ... a place where we have a little garden. Of course there won't be anyone... Except us. I can make you my temporary wife, To silence the gossips. You're doing me a great favor. I won't forget the seal. You want the check, don't you? Here is my address and private telephone number. You'll need it. Here's the tea! So, you said the caspian, right? It's a check from Nasser Moasser, Like this photocopy. It's in the 10 - lock safe. Those are his exact words! Give me it or he'll make me his wife. See? - Where did you meet? At his office. He wants to take me To the Caspian Sea on vacation. Is a bounced check worth it? This Friday, just us two. Do you doubt me? Mrs Mashdi, telephone! Who is it? Hello. How are you? So you're going to tha Caspian Sea? At such short notice? Why are you going without us? Fate won't allow us to come? Who's the guest? Someone very special? I could come and do the housekeeping. I can't change your mind? Have a nice time. There's nothing wrong with me. Why should there be? Goodbye. Which check did you say? - One like this. You won't regret it. Here, take tat as a reward, 30 % of the bounced check, as agreed. With a stamp on this, our deal is done. - Is that all? He agreed to sign it. Fate says no stamp! It's your fault if I go with him. Here's the address of the Caspian house. And his personal phone number. Want me to go for the sake of a stamp? That man! You're his secretary, right? I left the veil in your office this morning. He can find someone else to sell graves! I won't go to the Caspian! God bless you for letting me know. - Enjoy the Caspian! Men are so unfaithful. - They're not all the same. Madam, telephone! Hadj says we're going to the Caspian. Thank you again. Do you know when he last took us? Pick it up. Read it. It's salary slip. A ridiculous amount of money, isn't it? With today's expenses. And you embezzled 750 million. I'm paying for someone else. - You're kidding! You'll be out of here one day. I'll be here forever. What fruit do you like? Apples, oears, cherries? I'll bring fruit now and again! Only now and again? Tell me the truth about the money or else... I'm in no mood for joking. Tell me about your partner. I took him to the port, put him on a boat. I saw him leave, but didn't realize, He had all of the money! I'm going to change jobs. To do that, I need cash. Do you understand? And then, we'll both be free. We've been waiting for you for a long time. Oh, Father! Hello. When did you come? - He was looking for the hotel. This man kindly brought me here. Your mother was worried. How is she? - Well, just let me know if you need anything. Let's not stay here. come to my room. What are you doing here? Where's your husband? They wouldn't tell me. He's away for a few days. He'll be back soon. I never had the money to stay in hotels. Where did you get the money? Don't worry. we sold the house And are staying here for a while. Missing something? - Why do you say that? You're missing something? I call my old home, but I hang up quickly. I imagine it's our old phone. I imagine the inside of the house, ... with the new owners who hear the phone ringing, ... hust like when we were there! Here... Some recently published books. By the way, you said you've started writing? How's " KlLLlNG THE RABlD DOG " going? - I covet all unread books and unwritten subjects! " A letter on the way "! Prohibited I don't know if I want it published. You put so much into it! Yes, well... It's an experience of life with all its bitterness. Know what I'm reading now, Father? " Martial arts "! Missing something? - Oh, I'm just trying to give up smoking. It's so polluted here. I'm trynig to do some exercises, running, And meditating. I should watch my health. Nothing replaces children in a man's life. I agree with you, ... but I wasn't relying on him to be the father of my children. But now... I admit I shouldn't have left him Over such a stupid thought. When I saw him, He was considering suicide. Please call this number. Come on, you have the bed, I'll take the couch! I'll be more comfortable in my cheap place. I have to apply for printing permission And paper allocation. And then, I must get back. Your mother's all by herself. And this place makes me uneasy. We intended to create an import - export line ... for home appliances with a guaranteed 90 % profit. He could've easily handled it. But it wasn't in our field. Do you mean Nasser moasser? He was a special case in his line of work. Very active, and a non - stop worker. He was a handsome guy, But I didn't understand why he changed so much. Sorry, I don't get it. - Ok, I get it, I'll speak Persian! if you don't mind I'm happiest with that. Think internationally! How can it be matched by our subculture? Have you ever been behind bars? Not a good place. He's there! For 2 years if I don't get him out! My God! What are you going to do for 2 years? I don't understand! Anyway, I get my answers from the computer. 100 in 2 years is equal to 25 today. I accepte your general idea. I'm free tonight. Where do you eat? - Parden me? I'm looking for some friendly conversation. It can be arranged. I want to do something for him. 8 : 30? I have a prior engagement. It's up to you. Let me know. No, I'll cancle it. This is more important. What can I say? He's suffering for someone else's crime. I want to know more about you. We were apart for a year because of my jealousy. I'm so ashamed I accused him of cheating With his secretary. He cried like a child, ... but I went away to help my father and accupied myself with writing. You write? I would like to read one of your books. 8 : 30! A very good resturant near my apartment... I don't usually eat at night. - You'll sleep better! Why did you call in such a state? - I've got a problem, Fereshteh. Help me. If you do, I'll know I'm forgiven. - The past is the past. What do I do? You and whoever you like, Your fiance or mother and father, ... or all of them, tonight you're my guests. Here. I'll be dining with a man there. Please keep an eye on me. When he and I exchange papers, ... come over, make an excuse and take me with you. Is that all? - 8 : 30. You look pensive. He's slept in jail before. I wasn't thinking about him. You're ill at ease! Do you think so? Very clumsy! Very nervous! An old friend of mine just went past. I hope she didn't see me. Know what I mean? You won't eat dinner? - Have you forgotten why we're here? Oh yes! Nasser Moasser's check! Don't worry about your friend. My wife and kids are abroad just now. The money's ready and waiting. I left my things at home. But it's only a short walk away. OK? You want the acceptance letter! To be honest, I'm in a hurry. Do you like my apartment? I didn't imagine this. Do you have music, too? Classical, modern, pop, jazz, Easy listening, dance... What about the neighbors? They're friendly. There's a coat hanger. - The papers! Nothing's happening till I see them. It was there all the time! What a silly mistake! I just thought of something... - It's been on your mind all day! Couldn't a scandal be avoided? This goes against what I believe in, But you made me do it. Put it on the table and step back! Hands behind your head! Turn around! This is outrangeous! What about when you tried to cheat me? Sign it! How faithful you are! - To myself more than him! He's not worth it. I'm thinking of my own dignity! Thank you very much. Now maybe I can go have dinner. Here's the money! I wasn't going to cheat you! Although you earned this money by swindling! You've seen too many action movies! And you, too many porn movies! Cover your eyes! Now! Count to 100! Slowly! Understand? I got worried. Anuthing I can do? Run! I knew you'd come back for your change, sir. You were in such a rush before. The lady came and paid her share. She thought she could trick me! Keep the rest! Thank you, sir. This is from the late Tagvardi Who has no claim over the check. The date is a week before Tajvardi's death. I had a few signed papers from him. Is the typed information enough? Why didn't you want me to meet his inheritors? You wanted witnesses? Now I understand. They don't know anout the deal we've made. You're keeping part of the money, aren't you? What more do you want than the letter And check? Mr Moasser and the check mustn't be mentioned here. This is your tip for fiddling with the paerwork. They've got so much, it won't hurt them. A tree doesn't even know when a leaf falls off. But this money will turn my life around. How long must I settle other peaple's astronomical figures? What about me? - I don't trust you anymore. The money's here, but I must see the check first. I'll give it to you. Don't get engry. Just relax. It's the same. Well... I have the check and papers now. How much not to tell the others? No, don't do that! Then I want a real discount! The ball's in your court. Whatever you get it too much. Two thirds of the amount! Then we'll have no more to do with each other. It'll cost him a lot to get out of jail. Hurry, Golrokh. I've started counting the hours, Not the days! I know it's not easy. You were thrown lnto an impossible task. But hurry! There mustn't be too many complaints. I don't want it to get to court. Know how much court fees And 25 % tax would cost? Apart from all that, someone here is on my case. I don't know what he's up to, but he's bothering me! All the documents you wanted have been delivered. I got the complainants' approval. You'll be out within the week! Khaviari, Car Dealer This woman says you're following her. We happened to go the same way. He wants the vehicle documents. A prisoner gave him details of your car. - Did you believe him? Of course not, and he knews that! What's the connection? - We sold her the car. Get in. Don't get out till I say. Something's wrong. With all the money on your account, Why don't you get a better car? You checked my account! - We both know why. Just tell me where the money came from. Must I answer that? No legal obligation. Call it curiosity. From the royalties I get from my books. Have you published anything recently? " A letter on the way ". Have you read it? No. - That's no surprise, it hasn't been publushed. They give me money so I don't print anything. You're against everybody! They're stronger. - That's why I'm angry. Nothing important, was it? Well, to tell you the truth, I was really worried. Now I know I was right to be! I'm going away to Dubai And the Emirates for 3 months. We'll sell you Nasser Moasser's check. If you're in a rush, I'll stay on after we close. Why? So I can count the cash. My accountant needs a real bonus For the extra work, understand? I could have gone ro Tabanpour or Khavari. Mr Moasser wants no one else dragged in. He doesn't want them to know everything. Know what a bodygaurd is? The same thing we do in Baghestan. We're careful no one can touch him. So, today you're my bodyguard, right? I'll do anything for you! Wash your face! Is that him? Ignore him! One more time, what's the plan? Signal to me, and I'll bring the black bag. Through that door. So, what's the signal? You throw a ball of paper into that trashcan. Good, and then? I take the paper from the trashcan. Remember : everything is in it. Be careful and don't take your eyes off the window. Are you Mrs Kamali? Get the bag from her. This one third accepted! The rest, and you get the check! What about the late payment fine? Where's the money? You're looking at it. It's in one of those cars. It's not true. - Which one? If you're not happy with a third... Ok. I'll give you the check And the letter for a third. What are you waiting for? That I beg you? First, the check! - I want to see the money. Go up to that silver car. He thiught I didn't realize! Look! Go back to Baghestan! You're his bodyguard. Not mine! What happen to you? I think you're looking for someone to confide in. What happened? Won't you tell me? The hotel listens in on my calls. Very obviously. Could I make some calls? What a thing to say! Of course! I'll go and make some coffee. Black, please. Afrandi & Co. I want to speak to Mr Afrandi. He's still not there? I've called 10 times. How can I reach him? Is that Sangestani's office? I have an appointment tomorrow. I wanted to confirm it. Me? I'm Golrokh Kamali. Ok, it's confirmed. What time? Still the same story? Why are you pursuing it? Why you? One doesn't put oneself out So much for someone else. I can't let go now. No. It's not even for him anymore. It's for my own sake. I can't crack. It carries a high price, ... from humiliation and begging to... I'm sorry I came here. I won't lose now! Well, I don't understand. I really don't. How's your fiance? He'll be back any day now. I told you we're planning a trip to Europe. What an apportunity. It didn't happen for me. Don't waste it! I certainly won't, Golrokh. I won't. It took us a week to find her. Afrandi speaking. European Union ot Taiwan. Where's that moron hiding? Afrandi speaking... Her hands! What do you mean? Why? Let me go! Everybody knows where he is! You don't need to hit me! I tell you, he's in jail! Shut up! Do you want me to speak or shut up? Where is he? You can ask without shouting! He's in jail, taking the place of a moron like you! She's still lying! You work hard for your money! Well, we're sure there's something going on. We'll hire you for double the amount To find out what it is. It's not enough? I'm getting no money. For free? I am his wife. My condolences in advance for his death! I won't allow him to live! I would go to the jail to kill him there If I could! God help Nasser Moasser! Why won't you make the same deal with us? We made investidations. 30 million on an account in the black is better than 100 on one in the red. Why? Can you not shout at me? I'm shouting, and you don't hear me! We still have no answer. I'll ask one more time. Why didn't you come to us? I think your rivals have their own spies, And you aren't informed! I made that offer several times. Why didn't you tell Mr Afrandi? I never met you before. What's your name? The same one I gave, At the same number I left every time! It's the first I've heard of it. I've heard your voice so many times. I know the number by heart! Can you prove it? You're not expanding, you're going bankrupt! My secretary told you that? You're splitting the shares, Changing the business! It's true, and Nasser Moasser's money Would solve our problems more than he'd imagine. on one condition! Which is? That brute hit me. will you buy back each blow, Or shall I hit him? Boss, don't sacrifice me for a bit of money! We can't pay! - I beg you, don't let a woman hit me. My reputation's in your hands. We can't pay. Accept it. Here's the check. I need the acceptance letter, too. So, brute, ... you like fists, do you? Sorry. Don't hit me. Don't hit me. I'm sorry. Aren't you going to have his hands tied? Like they tied mine? - Is there money on your account? Here's the number of my branch. Hurry up. Don't hit me! Don't! You're scared, aren't you? You're not worth hitting, you wretch! How much is on her account? Enough to pay for his head! I'm sorry! Sorry! Don't hit me! You don't mind if the check's got blood on? Give the lady water and a towel! No. Enough, don't cry. I won't hit you. You're too stupid to realize what's happening. Hold that while I wash. Sangestani? Sangestani? Sangestani? Sangestani? Sangestani? Sangestani? Which one of you is Sangestani? We all are. There's a code name between us : Nasser Moasser! So it's you we've been waiting for. I'm in charge. The name on the check is Sangestani! Is that want you want? I won't let you play a trick on me. This is fake. That's news to me! I have a copy of the original. And the stub. The number of the check is different. And his hand never shakes When he's signing. What happened to your face? An accident? Come to my office and talk it over. - I'll have no witnesses! If it wasn't fake you wouldn't give it To me so readily. So... Do I wait or do I go? Go! There's another buyer for this check! At the same price? And what for? Personal revenge. He can clear the check. He'll be released one day. - God knows when that will be! You're well informed! - you have no other buyer. If you did, he'd have a name. Sell it, or I'll buy it from him. Who said I won't sell to you? Don't worry. My husband's freedom! The bastard! Sign the form, Sangestani. 20 % now is better than 100 % maybe never. The variable exchange rate Will compensate for our loss. Goddam thief! It seems you're not shy about swearing at him! Can't I curse him after that lump sum That I lost? Not in front of me! You signed? You made me, but I'm not happy about it. You're very tough! Let's get rid of her. Why should l? She's so aggressive to me. She could at least be nice, ... use kind words, pleased with me, try to get my agreement! My father, after 30 years in cultural activities, is out of stock of paper and ink... ... and has to get permission for every word he prints, ... but your kind can carry on doing business. And you force me to beg you on behalf of Someone of your sex! You can't understand how hard it is to bear! All right, I'll beg you then for someone else's sake! The poor guy is desperate, And I'm trying to help him, ... to get him back on his feet again! He was punished for someone else's mistake! Are you satisfied? It seems you're no good at begging. Do you want me to cry for it? No one's cried in front of me in a long time. Well, it's not going to happen now. All I have left is hatred and anger. Give me the check! The money's there! There's a case under the passenger seat. Who wants it? How do I open it? The code is 1317. Is it all there? Count it. Who'll tell the guarg to open the gate for me? Stop her! I congratulate you, Mrs Kamali. We've heard that Mr Nasser Moasser Was released 2 hours ago. Are you certain? - I heard his voice on the phone. he asked if you would go and see him. He said you'd know where. - Really? Mrs Kamali, one other thing. A man has been waiting for you over there For 2 or 3 hours. A man? - He's there, by the window. Hello, Mrs Kamali. Do you remember me? No. I don't think so. " someone who worries about you. " Do take a seat. Did you get to use the gune? - So, it was from you! You took on a difficult task. You've witnessed all this from a distance. Were you surprised to see me here? Yes, Javad Moghadam... Your husband's discredited partner And friend. I've actually been here for some time. After I left, I soon discovered That I don't have a record. What about the money you took? What are you talking about? So you really don't know? It's been with your husband all the time. I only became suspicious When he didn't send the money ... from our joint account for my journey. For days and days he made me believe They were pursuing me for a crime I knew nothing about. He worked it out well. He didn't pay for it, Apart from a few months in jail. By telling everyone that I'd gone on the run, He claimed that I'd taken the money abroad ... while he suffered in jail. - I don't believe you. you're accusing him! The important thing is this last part : That you've made every effort for him. Through you, with under a third of the money He got all the checks back. Now he legally owns more than the other Two thirds. You must be crazy! Why are you so against him? I know that it's hard to accept That you've been manipulated. I won't belive it, I won't believe it! Well, Mr Moghadam, we better hurry. We're talking more than 500 million! It's like a dream! I can't believe it. Nor could I when I saw him. Who? Saw Who? Javad Moghadam, Your partner. He said you have all the money, That he took nothing. He's back? You believed him? Why would he have come back? I was just thinking ahead. If I hadn't thought of it, he might have. We were all manipulated. You saw their finances. It wouldn't have hurt them! I stole from thieves! What a mess there'd be if everyone stole! What are you worried about? About the 500 million? No. I'm worried about your life. You don't need to worry about my life anymore. I told you I'd give you a surprise. As a token of my thanks and goodwill. Do you remember? What is it? A divorce letter? Don't worry about me. We're leaving here tomorrow. It's my turn to give you a present, for your wedding. What's this? I don't need it anymore. You might have a use for it. Thank you for all your help, Fereshteh. Have a good time. You're right. I'm surrounded by the characters of my new story ... and I should protect myself. reset assured that I'll return the car to your friend's showroom. Your face is all messed up Put some ointment on it. He didn't even ask what had happened to me. You have to be patient. It takes time to get over it. So, that's how it ended. The end of " KlLLlNG THE RABlD DOG "! I'll try, Eivaz. It takes time... to get over it. If you're back in the provinces, Come visit me.
