PROBERT AND DOMI GOING AT IT OFF THE FACEOFF. HE KNOWS DOMI'S A TOUGH KID. DOMI'S BEEN THREATENING THIS FIGHT FOR A LONG TIME. CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? PROBERT IS CUT BADLY. WRESTLING WAS BECOMING A REAL ENTERTAINMENT THING AT THE TIME. THERE WAS HULK HOGAN, AND MACHO MAN, AND BRET HART, AND THESE GUYS WERE REALLY LIVING IT UP. I THINK I WAS TRYING TO TRANSITION THAT INTO HOCKEY A LITTLE BIT. THE SECOND ONE WAS OBVIOUSLY THE HYPE, AND THE NEW YORK TIMES FRONT PAGE AND EVERYTHING ELSE. IT WAS LIKE A BOXING MATCH, FRAZIER/ALI, THEY HAD THE SIZE DIFFERENCE AND ALL THAT STUFF. HE HAD THE ADVANTAGE FOR SURE. HE HAD THE SMARTS GOING IN. THEY HAVE TRIED TO PUT THE EMPHASIS ON HOCKEY AND NOT FIGHTING, BUT TONIGHT THERE ISN'T MUCH THEY CAN DO ABOUT IT AS THE DETROIT REDWINGS FACE THE RANGERS IN NEW YORK. ACTUALLY, IT'S ABOUT TIE DOMI OF THE RANGERS AND BOB PROBERT OF THE RED WINGS. I'M NOT SCARED OF ANYBODY BUT I'M NOT BACKING DOWN OR ANYTHING. I'M GOING TO STICK UP FOR MY TEAMMATES LIKE I SAID, AND THE WHOLE IDEA IS TO HELP THIS TEAM WIN AND TO BACK MY TEAMMATES UP. ARE YOU GETTING A LITTLE TIRED OF... I'M SURE I'LL SEE HIM THEN. HE WAS LIKE, HE WAS LIKE... I'M TELL YOU, HIS EYES WERE LIKE LIGHTBULBS. LOOK AT YZERMAN, THE CAPTAIN THERE. THE WHOLE BENCH IS MOCKING DOMI WITH THE CHAMPIONSHIP BELT. OH MY GOODNESS. 20 THOUSAND PEOPLE THERE, GOING NUTS, AND YOU PEOPLE THAT DON'T LIKE FIGHTING, HOW MANY OF YOU WALKED TO GET A COFFEE WHILE THAT WAS ON? YOU CAN'T BE A WIMP OR ANYTHING. YOU HAVE TO BE STRONG, AND THAT'S WHAT THEY DID. I WAS ON THE POLICE DEPARTMENT WITH BOBBY'S DAD, AL. AS A MATTER OF FACT, WE RODE MOTORCYCLE TOGETHER. THE WAY THINGS ARE SCRUTINIZED FOR POLICE TODAY, WE PROBABLY HAD A MORE OPEN HAND WITH OUR POLICE WORK THEN. MY HUSBAND HAD HIS FIRST STROKE MARCH 21ST AND HE DIED THE FOLLOWING AUGUST 28TH. AND HE WASN'T HIMSELF AT ALL. HE COULDN'T REALLY TALK TOO MUCH, OR WALK, OR WHATEVER. I THINK IT WAS HARD ON THE BOYS TO SEE THE WAY THEIR DAD WENT, BECAUSE HE WAS ALWAYS A BIG STRONG MAN, AND THEN FOR THIS TO HAPPEN, IT WAS PRETTY HARD ON THE BOYS, I KNOW THAT. BUT THEY NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT. HE NEVER CRIED AT HIS DAD'S FUNERAL. THAT'S HOW HE WAS RAISED YOU KNOW, BOYS DON'T CRY, MEN DON'T CRY. IT SURE MAKES YOU GROW UP QUICK. THERE ARE TIMES WHERE YOU WISH YOU HAD YOUR DAD AROUND TO GET A MAN'S PERSPECTIVE ON DIFFERENT SITUATIONS YOU RUN INTO LATER IN LIFE. I THINK THINGS WOULD HAVE TURNED OUT DIFFERENT IF HE WOULD HAVE BEEN AROUND A LITTLE LONGER. HE LEFT THE DAY AFTER THE FUNERAL. THE DAY AFTER THE FUNERAL, ONE OF MY POLICE FRIENDS DROVE HIM DOWN TO CAMP IN BRANFORD. SO HE REALLY DIDN'T GRIEVE WITH HIS FATHER OR NOTHING BECAUSE HE WAS GONE. SO I LOST MY HUSBAND AND THE NEXT DAY MY SON WAS GONE TO BRANFORD. JUNIOR HOCKEY. NUMBER FOUR WITH A SHOT. HE SCORES! HE DIDN'T LIKE FIGHTING. AT LEAST WHAT HE TOLD ME, HE DIDN'T. HE DID IT BECAUSE HE DID IT, HE HAD TO DO IT. THESE GUYS ARE STILL GOING AT IT. THEY JUST GOT OUT OF THE BOX AGAIN... I BELIEVE IT IS BAUMGARTNER AND PROBERT, AND THEY WERE JUST TALKING THE WHOLE TIME IN THE PENALTY BOX. YOU KNEW SOMETHING WAS GOING TO HAPPEN... HE CERTAINLY WAS BROUGHT UP IN A CULTURE WHERE DRINKING WAS, YOU KNOW, A CENTERPIECE. THE ADJUSTMENT OF BEING AWAY FROM YOUR PARENTS IS QUITE LARGE BECAUSE YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN AT FIFTEEN, SIXTEEN. I RECALL IN BRANFORD, EVEN BEING UNDER 19, HIM GOING INTO THE BARS. THEY KNEW HE WAS UNDERAGE AND HE WOULD STILL GO TO THE BARS, TAKE THE WAITRESS HOME OR WHATEVER. THAT LED HIM GETTING KICKED OUT OF HIS PLACE IN BRANFORD. HE BROUGHT HER INTO THE CRAWLSPACE AT THE BILLET'S HOUSE, WHERE HE WAS SLEEPING WITH THE BILLET AS WELL, AND SHE SAW THE GIRL GETTING SNUCK OUT IN THE MORNING SHE GOT REALLY UPSET OVER IT. I THINK THE BILLET GOT VERY JEALOUS. WHEN HE MISSED THE ONTARIO HOCKEY LEAGUE ALL-STAR TEAM, THE GAME, HE MISSED IT BECAUSE HE WAS DRINKING THE NIGHT BEFORE. WE GOT SELECTED TO GO WITH THE OHL ALL-STAR GAME. WE WENT OUT AND HAD FEW BEERS. UNFORTUNATELY, WE SLEPT-IN IN THE MORNING, AND WE HAD A MEETING AT THE RINK THE NEXT DAY, AND WE WERE GOING TO BE SUSPENDED FOR TWO WEEKS FROM LEAGUE PLAY, FROM THE ALEXANDERS. YOU BASICALLY THINK THE WORLD IS OVER. YOUR HOCKEY WORLD'S OVER, YOUR DREAM IS DONE, AND IN HINDSIGHT, IT WAS A DUMB ASS THING TO DO. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT BOBBY PROBERT. IS HE BEAUTIFUL, OR IS HE BEAUTIFUL? I MEAN HIS REPUTATION PRECEDED HIM EVERY PLACE HE WENT, AND BACK IN THOSE DAYS HE WAS A GUNFIGHTER, A YOUNG GUNFIGHTER. THEY USED TO GO UP TO HIM AND SAY, "YOU WANNA GO? I GOTTA MAKE A REPUTATION." AND HE'D USUALLY WIN, BUT IF THE GUY SURVIVED, IT WOULD BE ALL RIGHT. THE FIGHTING HAS CHANGED QUITE A BIT. BACK THEN IT WAS, YOU KNOW, LET'S SEE WHO CAN HIT THE HARDEST AND WHO CAN KNOCK EACH OTHER DOWN. HE WAS THE BIG BOY ON THE BLOCK WITHOUT A DOUBT. BOB PROBERT WAS UNBELIEVABLE FOR ANY TEAM HE PLAYED FOR, BECAUSE WHENEVER HE WAS DRESSED THE OTHER TEAM FEARED HIM SO MUCH THAT EVERYBODY ON HIS TEAM BECAME BIGGER, STRONGER, BRAVER. AND THEY ARE JUST HAMMERING EACH OTHER! MY GOODNESS, LOOK AT THESE TWO TRADING PUNCHES! WOW, MAN OH MAN. THE NIGHT BEFORE, YOU HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME SLEEPING. OH, PROBERT JUST TOOK MANSON TO THE ICE! BOB PROBERT HITS BOB ROUSE, AND THERE'S THE HELMET! YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE PIECE OF HELMET COME RIGHT OFF. PROBERT'S STILL LOOSE, HE'S GOING TO GO AFTER MAGUIRE. NOW HE COMES IN... HE'S GOING TO GET SUSPENDED WITHOUT A DOUBT, THERE'S NO QUESTION. WE'VE GOT PROBERT GOING AT IT WITH EWAN. I KNEW THAT WAS COMING. OH! LOOK AT EWAN! IF HE LOST A FIGHT, HE WOULD FIGHT COMING OUT OF THE BOX. I REMEMBER WE WERE YOUNG AND IN ST LOUIS AND HE FOUGHT TODD EWAN, AND DOWN HE WENT. AND THE WHOLE TIME IN THE BOX I COULD SEE HIM JUST FUMING. AND OF COURSE IN THE OLD DAYS THEY CAME OUT OF THE BOX AND RIGHT TO EACH OTHER, AND BOB LANDED A LOT OF BLOWS. IT WAS RETRIBUTION OF "I CANT LOSE." NOW PROBERT, AS HE DOES SO OFTEN IN THESE FIGHTS, AS IT GOES ON HE SEEMS TO GAIN MOMENTUM, AND NOW HE'S GOT EWAN BACKPEDALING. PROBERT HAS REALLY MESSED UP HIS RIGHT HAND. HE MAY HAVE CAUGHT IT ON EWAN'S HELMET. HE WOULD DO CRAZY THINGS. HE HAD NO QUALMS ABOUT HITTING A GOALIE, NONE WHATSOEVER. DENIED BY KEANS. KEANS TRAPS IT BEHIND THE NET. OH, AND DOWN ON THE ICE. A HEAVY HIT. KEANS JUST GOT LEVELED BY PROBERT. NOW WATCH PROBERT. I DON'T WANT TO SAY PROBERT'S TOUGH OR ANYTHING, BUT KEEP YOUR EYE ON BUTCHER. NOW WATCH, RIENDEAU'S POINTING. DON'T POINT AT PROBERT! DON'T POINT AT PROBERT BECAUSE BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO YOU! ISN'T HE A BEAUTY? THAT'S BRUTAL. I KNOW, THAT'S TERRIBLE. SITTING IN THE DRESSING ROOM BEFORE A HOCKEY GAME, HE AND I WOULD PULL OUT THE ROSTER FOR THE OTHER TEAM AND WE'D KIND OF PICK AND CHOOSE WHO WAS GOING AFTER WHO FIRST. WHO GETS TO RUN THE GOALIE TONIGHT, BECAUSE WE KNEW WHEN SOMEONE RAN THE GOALIE THAT'S GOING TO BE A BRAWL. IT WAS THE '80S. BACK IN THE '80S, IT WAS SOCIAL. IF YOU WERE OF THE MINDSET THAT ME AND BOB WERE, YOU COULD KEEP DRINKING 'CAUSE OF IT. AND THE FIRST TIME YOU DID IT, YOU KNEW COULD DRINK FOR 4 MORE HOURS, HELL, SCRATCH ME IN. BOBBY WAS SO VALUABLE TO THE TEAM, THEY LOOKED THE OTHER WAY FOR A WHILE, UNTIL IT HIT THE PAPERS. THEY HAD TO TRY AND DO SOMETHING. THE CONCRETE OF THE LIGHT STANDARD CRUMBLED TO THE GROUND. HE CARRIED ON BEYOND THAT AND DROVE THROUGH A WINDOW OF THE RESTAURANT BAR, AND HIS CAR ENDED UP RIGHT AT THE BAR WHERE PEOPLE WERE SEATED IN BAR STOOLS IN THIS RESTAURANT. HE HAD GOTTEN INTO A FIGHT WITH SEVERAL WINDSOR POLICE OFFICERS, AND HE WAS BEATEN PRETTY BADLY. KIND OF IMPRESSED UPON HIM, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT A KID ANYMORE. YOU'RE A PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE NOW. PEOPLE ARE WATCHING, PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE TESTING YOU, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO SHOW SOME RESTRAINT. HIS CROSS EXAMINATION WENT SOMETHING LIKE THIS: "MR. PROBERT,"I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE CONSIDERED BY MANY TO BE THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION OF THE NHL." BOB FELL FOR IT AND WAS QUITE PROUD TO ANNOUNCE, YES, HE WAS INDEED A HOCKEY PLAYER. YES, HE WAS INDEED A PRETTY GOOD FIGHTER, AND HE WOULDN'T WANT TO FIGHT HIMSELF, HE WAS THAT GOOD. SO WE HAD A BREAK IN THE ACTION, AND THE CASE WASN'T QUITE OVER, AND HE CAME OUT DURING THE BREAK AND HE SAID, "I WASN'T VERY GOOD, WAS I?" IN FRONT OF A CRIMINAL JUDGE WHERE IT'S ALLEGED THAT YOU RESISTED ARREST AND YOU FOUGHT SEVERAL OFFICERS, AND ACTUALLY HAD THE BEST OF THEM FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, THOSE WERE NOT GOOD ANSWERS. I DO REMEMBER THAT HE DID BRING SOMEBODY HOME, SOME GIRL. I DON'T KNOW. SHE SEEMED LIKE A NICE GIRL, BUT I DON'T THINK HE SHOULD EVER HAVE DONE THAT. EVEN SOME OF HIS TREATMENT COUNSELORS WOULD FALL FOR HIS LYING. I'M THINKING, THESE ARE SEASONED TREATMENT OFFICERS, THEY SHOULD KNOW EVERYBODY WITH THOSE ADDICTIONS BECOMES A CON MAN OR CON WOMEN. AND HE COULD CON ANYBODY INTO THINKING THAT EVERYTHING WAS OKAY. IT FIRST CAME TO LIGHT THAT BOB TOTALED A CAR AND WAS IN JAIL IN WINDSOR. HOW YOU TOTAL A CAR IN A 30-MILE PER HOUR ZONE I DON'T KNOW, BUT BOB MANAGED TO DO IT. AND WE HAD A MEETING THE NEXT DAY, AND JIM LITES SAID, "HOW CAN HE GET THIS WAY? WHO'S FOLLOWING HIM? WHO'S LOOKING AFTER THIS GUY?" AND NO ONE'S SAYING IN THE ROOM, AND I LOOKED AROUND, SO I PUT MY HAND UP. AND THAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF A TOUGH LOVE RELATIONSHIP. WE WERE SELFISH, TOO. WE KNEW HOW GOOD BOB WAS AND HOW HE COULD HELP US, SO WE DIDN'T FIX IT THE WAY WE REALLY HAD TO FIX IT. WE WANTED HIM CLEANED UP IN TWO WEEKS. HE SPENT A LIFETIME GETTING THE WAY HE DID AND WE THOUGHT WE COULD FIX IT UP IN 7 TO 10 DAYS. WE TRIED A LOT OF THINGS. WE WENT TO ANTABUSE, WHICH IS A PILL YOU TAKE THAT MAKES YOU VIOLENTLY ILL WHEN YOU DRINK. WE'RE STANDING AROUND PRACTICE ONE DAY AND WE COULD SMELL IT, AND WE LOOK AT EACH OTHER, "WHO DRANK LAST NIGHT?" HE SAID, "WELL, I CHANGED THE PILLS IN YOUR OFFICE IN THE CONTAINER," SO I WAS GIVING HIM AN ADVIL OR SOMETHING. THERE WASN'T JUST ONE PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR. I THINK HE HAD A TEAM OF PEOPLE THAT WOULD KIND OF KEEP TABS ON BOB. IT DIDN'T LAST LONG, NONE OF THE NEWS WAS VERY GOOD. THERE WERE A LOT OF PROBERT JERSEYS IN THERE. I'D SAY THERE WERE MORE PROBERT JERSEYS IN THERE THAN THERE WAS ANY OTHER JERSEYS THAT I REMEMBER. SO BOB WAS AN ASSET TO THEM. IF HE WASN'T AN ASSET, TRUST ME, THEY WOULDN'T HAVE PUT UP WITH HIM AS LONG AS THEY DID. HE WAS ALMOST MR. DETROIT, AND IT WAS ALMOST LIKE HE CAN DO ANYTHING IN DETROIT AND GET AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE HE WAS SO BIG AND DETROIT, AND HE WAS LOVED BY HIS TEAMMATES. HE'S THE BADDEST GUY ON ICE, YOU KNOW? WHEN PROBIE AND I CAME TO DETROIT BACK IN THE EARLY OR MID-80S, THE WINGS WEREN'T WINNING. PEOPLE STARTED TALKING TO US AND CALLING US THE BRUISE BROTHERS. THE TEAM WILL SCORE A GOAL, THERE WOULDN'T BE A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE STANDING UP. BUT EVERY TIME SOMEONE DROPPED THEIR GLOVES, THE ENTIRE STADIUM STOOD UP. NOBODY WANTED TO PLAY AGAINST HIM. HE SCORES 29 GOALS THAT YEAR AND 398 PENALTY MINUTES. PLAYS IN THE ALL-STAR GAME. HE SCORES! BOB PROBERT! HE WAS JUST THAT VALUABLE. FROM THE DETROIT RED WINGS IN HIS ALL-STAR GAME DEBUT, ONE OF THE MOST RUGGED PLAYERS IN THE LEAGUE, NUMBER 24, RIGHT WINGER BOB PROBERT! NOW COMES PROBERT. GRETZKY FIRES. HE SCORES! THE ABILITY TO SCORE 20 OR MORE GOALS AND THE ABILITY TO OPERATE AS THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION OF THE NHL FOR THE MAJORITY OF HIS CAREER, I THINK YOU'D BE HARD PRESSED TO FIND THAT COMBINATION, THAT PACKAGE, IN ONE PERSON THROUGHOUT ALL OF NHL HISTORY. IT'S PRETTY RARE. THERE WAS EIGHT OR TEN OTHER PLAYERS THERE, A COUPLE THAT WERE PLAYING, AND A LOT OF GUYS WHO WERE HURT, AND BOB WAS THERE. AND I WAS MORE UPSET THAT THEY ALLOWED BOB TO DRINK WHEN THEY ALL KNEW THE PROBLEM HE HAD. I LOOKED AT HIM I SAID, "SO UNDERSTAND KLIMA AND PROBIE WERE OUT DRINKING LAST NIGHT." AND THE DEMER'S FACE JUST KIND OF TURNED WHITE. HE TOOK A DEEP BREATH AND HE LEANED BACK AND HE SPILLED HIS GUTS. HE TOLD US EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING, WHICH WAS HIGHLY UNUSUAL. WE LET JACQUES JUST GO ON AND ON ABOUT HOW DEVASTATED HE WAS, HOW DISAPPOINTED HE WAS, HOW HIS PLAYERS WERE A BUNCH OF IDIOTS, HOW THEY LET THEIR TEAMMATES DOWN, AND ON, AND ON, AND ON. TURNED OUT TO BE A PRETTY GOOD STORY. GRETZKY HELD IT IN, THEY SCORE! THERE'S BOB PROBERT PICTURED ON THE FRONT PAGE HERE. AND HEADLINE IS "RED WINGS STAR MISSES KEY GOAL: STAYING SOBER. "ONE NIGHT AFTER BOB PROBERT BROKE GORDIE HOWE'S REDWINGS PLAYOFF SCORING RECORD, HE BROKE HIS COACH'S HEART." THIS ABOUT THE GOOSE LOONIES INCIDENT IN EDMONTON. THE COUPLE OF STORIES WE'VE HAD THE LAST FEW DAYS HAVE BEEN REINSTATED THAT I WAS RIGHT BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT. KEITH GAVE WAS A WRITER FOR THE DETROIT FREE PRESS. VERY, VERY NEGATIVE. WAS HITTING THE PAPERS ALL THE TIME. PROBIE'S CAREER MISCONDUCT CHRONOLOGY IT'S CALLED, AND IT GOES ON PAGE, AFTER PAGE, AFTER PAGE OF HIS ISSUES WITH ALCOHOL AND OTHER THINGS. JULY 2ND, 1986: CHARGED WITH ASSAULTING A POLICE OFFICER AFTER A SCUFFLE AT A WINDSOR BAR. SHOCKER. DISCHARGED FROM A MINNESOTA HOSPITAL AFTER TREATMENT FOR ALCOHOLISM. THIS IS 1986. THIS IS RIGHT AFTER HIS ROOKIE SEASON IN THE NHL. AND IT GOES ON PAGE, AFTER PAGE, AFTER PAGE. JACQUES CREATED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MESS. THE RUMOURS HAD GONE AS FAR AS THE EARS OF COACH JASQUES DEMERS... I GOTTA TELL YOU THIS, TOO. I HAD WRITTEN SO MUCH ABOUT BOB PROBERT, AND PETR KLIMA, AND OTHERS. I FELT LIKE A HYPOCRITE WRITING ABOUT THE THINGS I HAD TO WRITE ABOUT. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BOB PROBERT AND ME IS THAT HE GOT CAUGHT AND I DIDN'T. I'M GUILTY OF THE SAME THINGS. MANY OF US ARE. HAVING A FEW DRINKS IN THE PRESS BOX, FINISHING UP MY STORY, HITTING LAST CALL, DRIVING HOME CERTAINLY PAST THE LEGAL LIMIT. I COULD HAVE GOT CAUGHT AND NAILED ANY NUMBER OF TIMES. I DIDN'T. I WAS LUCKIER THAN HIM. I MET BOB AT THE FRONT DESK AT THE RELAX PLAZA HERE IN WINDSOR. HE WAS STAYING THERE, HAD A LITTLE HIATUS. HE WAS HAVING SOME PROBLEMS WITH HIS VISA, I THINK. HIS WORK VISA. THE CHEMISTRY WAS JUST THERE. WE WENT ON OUR FIRST DATE AND WENT TO A CHINESE FOOD RESTAURANT THAT HIS DAD HAD JUST LOVED IN DOWNTOWN WINDSOR. AND WE ENJOYED THAT, AND THEN WE WENT OUT FOR SOME FROZEN YOGURT, AND IT WAS HIS FIRST TIME FOR FROZEN YOGURT, AND I FELL FOR THE "THIS DOESN'T SMELL RIGHT, SMELL THIS" AND I GOT YOGURT UP MY NOSE. WASN'T THAT CUTE? SO I WAS JUST, I DUNNO. EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM, HE WAS JUST ADORABLE. HE REALLY WAS. I SAID STAY AWAY FROM HIM. ALL MY INSTINCTS WENT UP. HE LOOKED LIKE TROUBLE. COCAINE MADE HIM SLOW DOWN. MOST TIMES IT SPEEDS YOU UP, BUT WITH BOB IT SLOWED HIM DOWN. ONE OF THE THINGS, BOB NEVER GOT ARRESTED WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER. I GUESS HE DID GET ARRESTED, BECAUSE WE GOT IN A SCRAP IN DALLAS. YOU KNOW WHAT, I THINK WE JUST WENT HARDER THAN OTHERS. I THINK THAT'S BASICALLY HOW I CAN SUM THAT UP. I REMEMBER HIM TELLING ME PLAYING AGAINST THE NEW YORK ISLANDERS, AND NOT REMEMBERING EVEN BEING ON THE ICE, HE WAS SO HIGH. THAT WAS A DRUG THAT WAS WIDELY USED IN THE NHL. LOOK OUT, CHELIOS IS GOING TO GET IT NOW. IT'S PRETTY SCARY WHEN YOU GET A GUY CHASING YOU AROUND ON THE ICE THAT'S DOING COCAINE. IT SEEMS LIKE IT GAVE YOU THIS CRAZY STRENGTH AND, YOU KNOW, THIS ENERGY. SO IT WAS DANGEROUS. CHELIOS COULD BE VULNERABLE. I'M SAYING, IT'S NOT RIGHT, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE ON THAT SHIT AND YOU'RE RUNNING AROUND. AND PROBIE WAS ACTUALLY REALLY SINCERE AND SOMEBODY GOES, "YOU'RE RIGHT." I THINK THE FIRST TIME I REALLY DID NOTICE WAS THE NIGHT HE WAS CAUGHT AT THE BORDER. TO BACK IT UP, WE WERE AT THE BAR IN WINDSOR, AND WATCHING HIM BEHIND THE BAR AND DRINKING OUT OF THE BOTTLE, AND IT WAS LIKE A SWITCH, SEEING SOMETHING THAT I'D NEVER SEEN BEFORE. LIKE THIS NON STOP, COULDN'T STOP. THEN GOING THROUGH THE TUNNEL, HIM SCRAMBLING TO HIDE THINGS. LAST NIGHT IT WAS THE RED WINGS VERSUS THE ISLANDERS. TODAY IT'S THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES VERSUS ROBERT ALLEN PROBERT. THE RED WINGS STAR COULD FACE UP TO 20 YEARS IN PRISON IF CONVICTED OF DRUG SMUGGLING CHARGES. CUSTOMS INSPECTORS STOPPED HIM AND THREE COMPANIONS AS THEY REACHED THE AMERICAN SIDE OF THE DETROIT/WINDSOR TUNNEL. IT WAS 5:15 a.m. IF CUSTOMS' VERSION IS TRUE, PROBERT WAS ALMOST INVITING A SEARCH. THE EXAMINING CUSTOMS OFFICER SAW THAT HIS IMMIGRATION DOCUMENT HAD EXPIRED, THEY NOTICED EMPTY LIQUOR CONTAINERS AND BEER CANS IN THE VEHICLE. A CHECK OF PROBERT'S POCKETS REVEALED A MILL, A DEVICE OFTEN USED TO GRIND COCAINE. A STRIP SEARCH FOLLOWED. INSPECTORS SAY THEY FOUND 14.3 GRAMS OF COCAINE IN PROBERT'S UNDERWEAR. I THINK HE REALLY WANTED TO GET CAUGHT, AND TALKING TO HIM LATER ON HE BASICALLY SAID THAT. ONE OF THE CUSTOMS IMMIGRATION OFFICERS SAID TO HIM, ACCORDING TO BOB, "DO YOU WANT TO GO IN THE WASHROOM?" BOB SAID, "NO." HE SAID, "NO, DO YOU WANT TO GO IN THE WASHROOM? MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO IN THE WASHROOM." AND BOB FINALLY GOT THE HINT THAT GUY WAS HELPING HIM OUT. BOB HAD SOME COCAINE WITH HIM, A WHOLE BUNCH OF COCAINE, AND THE OFFICERS SAID MAYBE YOU WANT TO FLUSH IT DOWN THE TOILET. AND BOB WAS READY TO FLUSH IT DOWN THE TOILET, SAID, "I CAN'T DO THAT." SO HE SAID, YOU KNOW "I SNIFFED IT ALL IN. I LOOKED LIKE I WAS HAVING A POWDERED JELLY DOUGHNUT WHEN I WALKED OUT OF THERE." I WAS 21 YEARS OLD, SO THE STRIP SEARCH WAS TERRIFYING. AND THE QUESTIONING... NOW THAT I LOOK BACK, IT SEEMS LIKE MAYBE 15-20 MINUTES, BUT PROBABLY 21-YEAR-OLD DANI WAS PROBABLY FEELING LIKE IT WAS AN ETERNITY. AFTER THAT I REMEMBER THE SUN COMING UP AND EVERYTHING HITTING THE NEWS. PROBERT IS SCHEDULED BACK IN COURT MARCH 22ND. HE FACES NOT ONLY A JAIL TERM BUT BANISHMENT OF THE NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE. AND THE IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE SAYS IT WILL SEEK TO DEPORT PROBERT REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME OF THIS DRUG CASE. THE ARREST OF BOB PROBERT ON COCAINE CHARGES COULD CERTAINLY DEVASTATE HIS CAREER. TODAY'S NEWS COMES AS A TREMENDOUS DISAPPOINTMENT TO THE RED WINGS. HIS DRINKING PROBLEM HAS BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED. HE'S BEEN IN ALCOHOL REHABILITATION CLINICS 5 TIMES IN THE PAST. OFFICIALS FOUND OVER 14 GRAMS OF COCAINE IN HIS POSSESSION. FOR PROBERT, A POSSIBLE JAIL TERM IN HIS FUTURE. FOR THE REDWINGS, A HIDDEN SIGH OF RELIEF. FOR SOME REASON CAN'T HELP HIMSELF. ARE DRUGS THE DEMON THAT'S RUINED HIM? DO THOSE CLOSES TO HIM HAVE TO SHARE THE RESPONSIBLY FOR HIS DEMISE, OR IS PROBERT BENT ON SELF DESTRUCTION? A CRUEL AND WILLING ACCOMPLICE IN OWN RUINATION? YOU KNOW, IF SOMEBODY RUNS AFOUL OF THE RULES THEY OUGHT TO SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES. I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE EXPRESSED THAT. I FEEL SORRY FOR HIS PARENTS. AND IT'S A ROUGH MARK FOR THE CITY OF WINDSOR. I THINK HE SHOULD BE THROWN IN JAIL. YOU DON'T HAVE ANY SYMPATHY FOR HIM? NO, HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN KICKED OUT OF THE NHL A LONG TIME AGO. THE MEDIA COVERAGE I DON'T EVEN THINK WAS GUILTY OF SENSATIONALIZING WHEN THEY, YOU KNOW, PREDICTED THAT IT WAS THE END OF HIS CAREER, YOU KNOW THAT HE WOULD MOST CERTAINLY BE INCARCERATED, MOST CERTAINLY BE DEPORTED UPON COMPLETION OF HIS INCARCERATION. AND YOU KNOW, AND OFF IT WENT. FOR ALL YOU KIDS OUT THERE, ALL YOU YOUNG HOCKEY PLAYERS, I JUST WANT TO SAY SOMETHING. THINK OF SOMETHING WHEN SOMEBODY OFFERS YOU JUNK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, THINK OF BOB PROBERT. HERE'S A GUY, BIG GUY, 6' 3", 3-YEAR CONTRACT. HE HAD DETROIT IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND, EVERYBODY LOVED HIM, COACH LOVED HIM. HE WALKED INTO A ROOM AND EVERY EYE TURNED TO HIM. NOW IT'S ALL GONE. I DO SYMPATHIZE OR HAVE SYMPATHY FOR BOBBY, BECAUSE I THINK HIS PROBLEMS GO BEYOND HIS OWN CONTROL. I THINK EVEN IF HE WANTED TO CHANGE HE NEEDED MORE HELP THAN JUST HIMSELF TO DO IT. HE'S GOTTA GET HIS LIFE STRAIGHTENED OUT, AND UNTIL HE DOES THAT, HE'S NOT REALLY GOOD TO HIMSELF OR TO US. FIRST COUPLE TIMES YOU SAY, WELL HE SCREWED UP, LET'S GIVE HIM A CHANCE. BUT IT'S BEEN ABOUT MAYBE 12-15 TIMES, SO I DON'T THINK WE FEEL SORRY FOR HIM NOW. PROBERT WALKED INTO THE COURTHOUSE NOT KNOWING IF HE WOULD WALK OUT AGAIN A FREE MAN. FACING PATRICK DUGGEN, THE TEARS WELLED UP IN HIS EYES AS HE TRIED TO SPEAK. PROBERT TOLD THE JUDGE THAT HE WAS SORRY FOR WHAT HE HAD DONE, SORRY HE HAD LET HIS TEAMMATES, HIS FAMILY, HIS FRIENDS, AND HIS FANS DOWN. IT REALLY HURT TO SEE PEOPLE I LET DOWN THAT STILL CARE ABOUT ME. WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE ABLE TO PLAY HOCKEY SOMEDAY? I WOULD LIKE TO GET BACK INTO HOCKEY. I DO MISS IT. THERE ARE A FEW OBSTACLES IN THE WAY RIGHT NOW, BUT YES, I WOULD LIKE TO PLAY HOCKEY AGAIN SOMEDAY. I REMEMBER VISITING BOB IN ROCHESTER, MINNESOTA, WHEN HE WAS AT THE FEDERAL FACILITY THERE. I'D NEVER BEEN TO A FEDERAL PRISON BEFORE. IT WAS AN INTIMIDATING THING, YOU KNOW. THEY TAKE YOUR THEY FINGERPRINT, AND YOU GO IN THERE TO VISIT. AND WE PROBABLY SPENT AN HOUR WITH BOB VISITING. HE WAS, YOU KNOW, NERVOUS AND ANXIOUS, AS YOU WOULD EXPECT A 24-YEAR-OLD GUY TO BE. PROBIE TAKES THE ICE, AND I MEAN I GET CHILLS THINKING ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW, THE CROWD STARTS CHANTING HIS NAME. AND THE CROWD REACTING TO NUMBER 24, BOB PROBERT, TAKING HIS FIRST SHIFT THIS AFTERNOON. AND WATCH WHAT HAPPENS HERE. PROBERT STEPS ON THE STICK RIGHT THERE. WELL, BOB I DON'T THINK HAD REALLY LOST A FIGHT UP UNTIL THAT POINT, SO IT WAS A BIG THING. AND MOMENTUM STARTED BUILDING LIKE I WAS THE NEW UP AND COMING GUY AND HE WAS THE REIGNING KING, SO THE HYPE GREW. THEY SAID, LET'S GO, LET'S GO, AND AWAY THEY GO. CROWDER GETS A COUPLE OF EARLY ONES IN. I ALWAYS SAID IT WAS KIND OF LIKE RIDING A BULL. YOU'D BETTER HOLD ON, YOU'D BETTER STAY ON TOP OF IT BECAUSE HE SEEMED TO GET MORE WORKED UP AS THE FIGHT WENT ON. FACE TO FACE RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE NEW JERSEY BENCH. PROBERT GETS A RIGHT TO CROWDER... WHOA! PROBERT NAILS... HE KNOCKS HIM DOWN! I KNOW RON MACLEAN AND DON CHERRY HAD DROVE DOWN TO COME WATCH THE GAME. WE'VE GOT A FIGHT COMING UP HERE! SHOW IT! ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO! NOW WATCH THE HELMET GO FLYING. THIS IS A GREAT FIGHT, THIS IS A RETURN OF PROBERT AND CROWDER AND 20,000 PEOPLE. THIS IS KNOCKOUT COMING UP HERE. RON MACLEAN AND I, WE WENT TO DETROIT, AND IT WAS LIKE A HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP FIGHT. IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE. IN DETROIT, THEY DIDN'T CARE, THE PUCK WAS IN THE FAR END, THEY JUST KEPT THEIR EYE ON BOB AND TROY. AND SURE ENOUGH, THEY GET INTO IT. AND BOB HIT TROY SO HARD HIS HELMET WENT ABOUT TEN FEET IN THE AIR. AND THEY HAD TWO BEAUTIES. EVERYBODY KNOWS, I DON'T THINK HE EVER GOT BEAT. HE MIGHT BE BEAT BY SOMEBODY, BUT I DON'T REMEMBER HIM EVER BEING BEAT. LOOK AT THIS, YOU'VE GOT GRIMSON, THAT'S PROBERT, AND HERE THEY GO. GRIMSON CAME RIGHT OFF OF THE CHICAGO BENCH, CAME AFTER PROBERT, AND WAS YELLING AT HIM, HE WANTED HIM TO GO. AND HE GOT HIS WISH. I THINK IT HAD A LOT TO DO WITH JUST HIS PERSONAL DISREGARD FOR HIS OWN PHYSICAL WELLBEING. HE WASN'T THE LEAST BIT CONCERNED ABOUT GETTING HIT. THE EMOTIONAL DRAIN OF HAVING TO GET UP FOR A BATTLE WITH A GUY LIKE PROBERT, THAT CAN REALLY CONSUME YOUR THOUGHTS AND YOUR STATE OF MIND. YOU JUST FEEL LIKE THERE'S NO WAY YOU COULD HURT HIM. HE HAD THAT BOB PROBERT LOOK LIKE, "I WANT TO KILL YOU." PROBERT AND SIMPSON DROP THE GLOVES AT CENTER! HE WANTED TO KILL YOU EVERY TIME YOU FOUGHT. AND PROBERT GOT IN ANOTHER! AN UPPERCUT LANDED FROM PROBERT, AND NOW HE'S PLUGGING AWAY. WITH THE RIGHT HAND LOOSE, GOT A COUPLE INTO PROBERT. PROBERT HASN'T EVEN BEGUN TO FIGHT YET. THERE WAS TWO SIDES OF BOB AND YOU JUST DIDN'T WANT TO BE ON THE WRONG ONE. WE'VE GOT PROBERT AND TWIST, TWO OF THE HEAVYWEIGHTS. FOR BOB'S GENERATION OF HOCKEY, HE WAS THE MEASURING STICK. GOT TO STACK UP. IF YOU'RE THE MEASURING STICK, THAT MEANS YOU'RE THE MAN. THESE GUYS ARE PURE HEAVYWEIGHTS OF THIS LEAGUE. YOU'RE GOING TO FIGHT THE BIGGEST KID AT YOUR SCHOOL IN THE FIELD AND EVERYBODY'S GONNA WATCH. WHEN HE WAS IN HIS WILD AND CRAZY DAYS IN DETROIT, YOU NEVER KNEW WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO. DETROIT COMES AWAY AND THE FIGHT'S ON BOB PROBERT. OH MAN, JEREMY ROENICK AND PROBERT. NOW THE BLACKHAWKS ARE TRYING TO GET IN. THEY'VE GOT TO GET IN. THERE'S NO CHOICE HERE. JEREMY ROENICK IS A TOUGH KID THAT'S A GAMER, BUT FOR HIM TO STAND TOE-TO-TOE WITH BOB PROBERT... IT WAS THAT THAT SENSE OF NOT KNOWING, THAT SOMETIMES WAS MORE FEARFUL ABOUT BOB. PROBERT AGAIN, SENDS IT IN. PROBERT AND MCSORLEY, PROBERT TOOK A SWING AT HIM! PROBERT AND MCSORLEY, THEY'RE BUMPING! THEY'RE NOT DONE YET, OH NO. THEY CAN'T STEP INTO THESE PUNCHES. THIS IS ONE OF THE LONGEST FIGHTS I'VE EVER SEEN. I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE GO THIS LONG. HIS BROTHER DIDN'T WANT HIM MARRYING ME. HE WAS GOING TO GET A STACK OF MONEY AND HEAD TO VEGAS WITH HIS BROTHER. I THINK IT WAS MY MAID OF HONOR AND MY MOM DISCUSSING IN THE HALLWAY A LITTLE BIT OF, YEAH, THEY'RE LOOKING FOR BOB, THEY COULDN'T FIND BOB, AND I WAS DETECTING A LITTLE BIT OF PANIC IN THE ROOM. IT JUST WAS A TRAIN WRECK, RIGHT? IT WASN'T A SMOOTH TRANSITION TO GET BOB TO THE WEDDING FACILITY, I CAN TELL YOU THAT. BOB, I'D JUST LIKE TO SAY TAKE CARE OF OUR BABY. YOU'RE THE SON THAT LESLIE NEVER HAD. YOU'VE TAKEN A DAUGHTER THAT'S VERY PRECIOUS TO US, AND WE LOVE YOU BOTH VERY MUCH, AND WE WISH YOU THE BEST OF LIFE FROM HERE ON IN. THE SWIRL OF ACTIVITY THAT ALWAYS SURROUNDED BOB WAS NOT SOMETHING I WAS EVER REALLY COMFORTABLE WITH. YOU KNOW, IT WAS A FRENETIC PACE. IT WAS JUST HIGH ENERGY, IS PROBABLY THE BEST WAY... ANYTHING HE DID WAS ALWAYS HIGH ENERGY. NEEDLESS TO SAY, ON JULY 3, 1993, 45 MINUTES LATE, WE DID GET MARRIED. IT HAPPENED. HERE IS THE NEWLYWEDS, BOBBY AND DANI! IS SHE BEAUTIFUL OR WHAT? LISTEN, I'VE GOT TO ASK YOU THE QUESTION: IS HE AS TOUGH AT HOME AS HE IS ON THE ICE? BIG TEDDY BEAR. BIG TEDDY BEAR! PUSH YOU AROUND, EH? COME ON! HOLY COW, LOOK AT THAT! SHE'S A BIG ONE. I SPOKE LATER TO ONE OF THE ARRESTING OFFICERS THAT WAS THERE, AND HE TOLD ME THAT WHEN HE LEANED OVER BOB TRYING TO FIND OUT IF HE WAS OKAY, BOB SAID TO THE OFFICER, "JUST ARREST ME WITH THE USUAL." HE WAS HANDCUFFED TO A BED IN THE ROOM WHEN I WALKED IN. AND HE CRIED WHEN HE SAW ME. HE CRIED WHEN HE SAW ME IN MY FULL EIGHT MONTHS OF PREGNANCY. HE WAS ALWAYS WORRIED ABOUT HURTING ME, OR HURTING THE KIDS, THE PAIN HE CAUSED OTHERS, SO HIM LAYING EYES ON ME, SEEING ME WADDLE IN, IT HIT HIM AND HE KNEW HE SCREWED UP BIG. THE MEDIA IS ONCE AGAIN BLOWN UP. THEY HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO THINK THAT HIS CAREER'S OVER, THEN IT'S ANNOUNCED IN THE MEDIA THAT THE RED WINGS HAVE CUT HIM LOOSE. THE PHONE RINGS. THEY'RE INVITING US TO COME TO CHICAGO IN THE NEXT DAY. 24 HOURS LATER, BOB AND I ARE IN MR. WIRTZ'S BEAUTIFUL TOWN HOUSE ON LAKE DRIVE IN CHICAGO. AND AN ACCIDENT THAT SHOULD HAVE KILLED HIM TOOK HIM TO A MILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL RAISE. UM... OKAY. THE STRAPS GO IN THE BACK, RIGHT? EVERYTHING CHANGED. EVERYTHING CHANGED INSTANTLY. GOING TO CHICAGO, IT WAS FULL TIME RECOVERY. SO HE HAD EIGHT YEARS OF SOBRIETY IN CHICAGO. WHAT DO YOU SAY WHEN YOU KNOCK ON THE DOOR? TRICK OR TREAT. TRICK OR TREAT. WHICH ONE'S YOUR FAVOURITE PUMPKIN, BROGAN? TRICK OR TREAT! JUST LIKE THAT. WHICH ONE'S YOUR FAVOURITE PUMPKIN? WHICH ONE DO YOU LIKE BETTER? THAT ONE. YEAH, THAT'S DADDY'S. ALL OF THE CUSHIONS OFF THE COUCH AND US BOUNCING AROUND, WHERE THERE WAS JUMPING ON THE BED, OR LISTENING TO OLDIES AND HAVING A GOOD TIME, AND BOB DANCING WITH THE KIDS AND EACH OF THEM GETTING THROWN AROUND AND HAVING SO MUCH FUN. EVERYTHING WAS ADRENALINE BASED. IT HAD TO BE ON THE BOAT, TUBING, IT HAD TO BE ON THE DIRT BIKES, ON THE FOUR-WHEELERS, ON THE MOTORCYCLES. LIKE WE WERE ON MOTORCYCLES BEFORE WE COULD EVEN WALK, WE WERE SITTING WITH HIM. SO EVERYTHING WAS JUST ON THE GO ALL THE TIME. HE LOVED HIS DUCK CALL, WHICH I'M SURE THE OTHER KIDS WILL SAY THAT. THAT DUCK CALL, HE'D BE LIKE, FROM A MILE AWAY. THIS I'VE GOT TO GET. BIG BOB. PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE, RIGHT THERE. OH MY GOD, YOU'RE SO GRACEFUL! THE FIRST HALF OF HIS CAREER WHERE HE WASN'T LOOKING AT YOU, HE JUST SEEMED TO BE STARING PAST YOU, AND YOU WERE, YOU WERE ALMOST A NON-ENTITY IN THE EQUATION. HE HAD JUST THIS KIND OF FACELESS COUNTENANCE ALMOST, AND YOU WERE WAGING WAR WITH THIS INANIMATE BEING. I DIDN'T SEE THAT THAT SAME VERSION OF BOB TOWARDS THE END OF HIS CAREER. HE SEEMS FAR MORE HUMAN, FAR MORE MORTAL THAN HE USED TO. HE WAS IN THE LAST YEAR HIS CONTRACT AND HE WASN'T UNDER THAT DRUG, ALCOHOL, OR GAMBLING POLICY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR AND YOU JUST SAW HIM SLOWLY STARTING TO FALL OFF THE WAGON A LITTLE BIT. YOU KNOW THEY CALL HIM THE NIGHT BEFORE, AND AS SOON AS THE DOOR KNOCKED HE KNEW IT WAS A GUY WHO WAS TAKING HIS SAMPLE, AND BEFORE HE ANSWERED THE DOOR YOU WOULD TAKE THAT URINE THAT WAS CLEAN AND PUT IN THE MICROWAVE FOR, I DON'T KNOW, A SMALL AMOUNT OF SECONDS. HE KNEW THAT TEMPERATURE WHERE THE PEE HAS TO BE FOR WHEN THEY TAKE A TEMPERATURE SO THEY KNOW IT'S REAL. IF HE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING, HE FOUND WAYS TO DO IT. HIS INTAKE OF PILLS WAS PRETTY EXCESSIVE. I REMEMBER HE WOULD TAKE OXY 80S, AND WHAT HE WOULD DO IS DIP THEM IN COCA-COLA TO TAKE THE TIMED RELEASE OFF AND USE ONE OF THOSE FOOT FILE SCRAPERS, SCRAPE THEM DOWN AND SNORT THEM. I HATED SEEING IT, AND I REMEMBER HIM DOING UP TO 18 A DAY, AND THAT'S ENOUGH TO KILL ANYBODY. IT WAS LEGIT. HE HAD BACK PAIN. THERE WERE DAYS WHERE I HAD TO PUSH HIM OUT OF BED WITH BOTH FEET TO HELP HIM GET UP. THERE'S NO DENYING HE WAS IN A LOT OF PAIN. BUT THE DOCTOR WAS QUICK TO PRESCRIBE THE OPIOIDS. I THINK IN THE END, THE OPIATES GOT AHOLD OF HIM AND TOOK HIM DOWN. YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER BOB WAS IN A LOT OF FIGHTS AND HE LIVED IN BODILY PAIN DAILY. AND THAT'S WHAT THEY GAVE HIM, AND THEY'RE SO EASY TO GET ADDICTED TO. HOCKEY PLAYERS ABUSE THEIR BODIES. FIGHTERS REALLY ABUSED THEIR BODY. LIKE YOU'RE JAMMING SHOULDERS AND BACKS AND NECKS AND HANDS, AND SO I HAD MANY, MANY FRIENDS THAT WERE FIGHTERS THAT DID A LOT OF PILLS. I DON'T THINK THE AVERAGE EVERYDAY PERSON DOESN'T - WOULD NEVER UNDERSTAND THE PUNISHMENT WE PUT OUR BODIES THROUGH EVERY DAY. THE STRESS, THE STRAIN, THE BEATING, AND I MEAN IT'S CONSTANT, AND IT'S EVERY DAY. I COULD TELL YOU, BUT YOU COULDN'T IMAGINE. HE HAD CTE. DR. MCKEE, IN THE CONFERENCE CALL THAT WE HAD, BASICALLY WAS SAYING THAT ON A SCALE OF ONE TO FOUR, HE WAS A TWO, BORDERING ON A THREE. YOU CAN'T SIT THERE AND SPECULATE WHETHER OR NOT HE WOULD HAVE HAD DEMENTIA, EARLY ONSET DEMENTIA, ALZHEIMERS, BUT THE LIKELIHOOD WAS YES. I REMEMBER JUST PLAYING HIDE AND SEEK WITH HIM ONE DAY AND I WAS, I KID YOU NOT, PROBABLY THE SAME SPACE BETWEEN ME AND YOU, I WAS STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM AND HE HONESTLY COULDN'T EVEN SEE ME. IT'S LIKE I WASN'T EVEN THERE TO HIM. AND I WAS LITERALLY TALKING TO HIM, HE WAS JUST, LIKE, VERY CONFUSED. YOU COULD BRING UP SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO AND HE WOULDN'T KNOW, OR HE WOULDN'T REMEMBER. I DON'T WANT TO GET ON THAT SHIT. IF I GET INTO CONCUSSIONS, YOU NOTICE ON COACH'S CORNER, I NEVER TALK ABOUT CONCUSSIONS, BECAUSE YOU'RE REALLY GETTING INTO SOMETHING. YOU GUYS BETTER BE VERY CAREFUL BECAUSE THAT'S A TOUCHY SUBJECT RIGHT NOW. HE'S GOT THE MACHINEGUN. BOY OH BOY, HE HIT HIM RIGHT ON THE BUTTON. THE REASON I HAD TO LEAVE THE GAME ULTIMATELY WAS DUE TO POST CONCUSSION SYNDROME. DOMI COME UP WITH A HIT. DOMI IS HIT HIMSELF. DOMI'S TOUGH, BUT YOU CAN SEE HE WENT HEADFIRST INTO THE GLASS. I DON'T WANT TO KNOW. I ALWAYS TELL DOCTORS THAT ARE TRYING TO GET ME IN THESE SCANNING MACHINES, I DON'T WANT TO BREAK THEIR MACHINES. BUT THE REALITY IS I SHOULD BE TAKING CARE OF MYSELF BECAUSE OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO GUYS LIKE BOB AND OTHER PEOPLE, BUT I THINK IT'S JUST US, OUR STUBBORNNESS AND STUFF. TRYING TO CHANGE A LITTLE BIT AT A TIME, TO REALLY THINK OF MY KIDS, AND MY FAMILY, AND MY WIFE, AND EVERYBODY BECAUSE IT'S REAL. LIFE IS A VERY DELICATE THING. I THINK, WHEN YOU'RE NOT PREPARED FOR IT, LIKE NOBODY WAS FOR BOB, ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN TO ANYBODY AT ANY GIVEN TIME. AND FLYNN GOES DOWN AND TAKES ANOTHER RIGHT HAND, AND MORE RIGHT HANDS FROM PARKER! I'VE HIT SOME PEOPLE PRETTY HARD, AND I'VE FELT THINGS BREAK, AND I'VE FELT THINGS SHIFT, AND I'VE FELT THINGS MOVE, AND I THINK TO MYSELF, "OH NO." AND YOU KIND OF HAVE THAT YOU KNOW SENSE OF, YOU KNOW, OH SHIT, WHAT DID I JUST DO? IT WAS ALMOST A WAR MENTALITY, LIKE KILL OR BE KILLED. PROBERT HIT HIM WITH A RIGHT! ANOTHER ONE! YOU KNOW, GETTING PUNCHED REALLY HARD IN THE HEAD DOES DO THINGS TO YOU OVER TIME, AND AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU DO WANT A QUALITY OF LIFE WHERE YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO HOLD YOUR KIDS AND DO THINGS WITH YOUR KIDS AND NOT BE COOPED UP IN A BASEMENT BECAUSE LIGHT AFFECTS YOU SO BAD THAT IT JUST SENDS YOU INTO A TIZZY. THE POST CAREER IS TOUGH ON A LOT OF GUYS. PLENTY OF PLAYERS STRUGGLING WITH THAT NOT BEING AROUND THE GUYS, NOT HAVING YOUR REGIMENTS SCHEDULED TO FOLLOW, AND YOU KNOW, BEING ON THE BUS, BEING AT THE RINK AT CERTAIN TIMES. SO YOU FIND YOURSELF WITH SO MUCH TIME AND NOTHING TO DO. YOU MISS THE GUYS. GOOD MORNING! MERRY CHRISTMAS 2002. IT TAKES ITS TOLL ON YOU. I THINK BOB FELT THAT AND, YOU KNOW, LIKE I DID. WE FELT LIKE WE WERE KIND OF LETTING THE TEAM DOWN, THE FANS DOWN, AND IT WAS A TOUGH TIME. AND THEN YOU'RE LEFT WITH NOTHING AND YOU'RE HOME WITH THE WIFE AND KIDS AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST YOU DON'T HAVE THAT VOID, THAT ADRENALINE RUSH YOU NEED TO FILL. HO, HO, HO, MERRY CHRISTMAS! CHRISTMAS AFTERNOON. HOW ARE YOU? WHAT TIME IS IT? WE'VE BEEN VIDEOTAPING YOU WITH TOYS ON YOUR HEAD, STUFF STUCK TO YOU, EVERYTHING, AND YOU HAVEN'T EVEN NOTICED. WHERE'S MY TOYS? I'LL GIVE YOU A FAMILY SHOT. HOW'S THAT FOR A FAMILY SHOT. GET IN THERE. I WANT SOME LOVING HERE. CAN YOU FEEL THE LOVE? CAN YOU FEEL THE LOVE THIS CHRISTMAS MORNING? HO, HO, HO. HE JUST WANT TO GO AWOL. HE JUST WANTED TO DISAPPEAR AND DIDN'T WANT US TO SEE THIS SIDE OF HIM. HE WANTED TO PROTECT US FROM THAT BAD SIDE OF WHO HE WAS. BUT NO, HE WAS VERY ASHAMED. YOU COULD SEE IT IN HIS FACE, THAT WAS JUST SOMETHING IN HIS EYES, YOU COULD SEE THE SADNESS WHEN HE WOULD COME HOME, AND THAT WOULD BE SO HEARTBREAKING. "DEAR DISEASE, YOU HAVE TAKEN AWAY MY FREEDOM TO MAKE HEALTHY CHOICES. YOU HAVE TAKEN AWAY MY VALUABLE TIME FROM MY WONDERFUL WIFE, DANI, AND MY FOUR KIDS. YOU HAVE TAKEN AWAY MY SELF-RESPECT AND DIGNITY. YOU HAVE TURNED ME INTO SOMEONE I AM NOT. YOU HAVE HURT ME FINANCIALLY. YOU HAVE CONTROLLED MY THOUGHTS AND MY FEELINGS. YOU TOOK ME AWAY FROM THINGS I USED TO DO TO HAVE FUN. YOU TOOK AWAY MY ABILITY TO KEEP PROMISES BY RUNNING MY WILL. AT TIMES YOU TOOK ME AWAY FROM PEOPLE THAT TRULY LOVE ME. YOU TOOK AWAY FROM ME OUR TWINS' BIRTHDAY. YOU TOOK AWAY FROM ME CHRISTMAS OF 2002. YOU TOOK A LOT FROM ME, BUT THAT IS ABOUT TO STOP. TO CHANGE." THAT'S WHEN HE ENDED UP GOING TO FLORIDA, TO THE KAREN FOUNDATION. THAT WAS THE REHAB THAT REALLY HELPED HIM, REALLY CLICKED. HE WAS DOING THE HALFWAY HOUSE PART OF IT. HE WAS ARRESTED. TASERED THREE TIMES. YEAH, THREE TIMES. SOILED HIMSELF. WAS THROWN IN JAIL. GOT ACCUSED OF TRYING TO CLOG THE PLUMBING, BUT IT WAS... HE WAS TRYING TO RINSE OUT HIS BOXERS. NOT ONE OF HIS GREATEST HIGHLIGHTS IN HIS LIFE, THAT'S FOR SURE. IT WAS A TERRIBLE TIME. WHEN BOB WAS DRINKING HE HAD A... HE WAS A DIFFERENT PERSON. HE WASN'T BOB. I THINK WHEN HE DRANK, HE TURNED OFF THAT FAMILY SWITCH. I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN HIM THAT MESSED UP. IT WAS CRAZY. HE HAD CRAZY EYES AND THE WAY HE WAS ACTING, HE WAS FLIPPING OUT. HE HAD THE BUTCHER BLOCK OF KNIVES. I HAD CALLED MY FATHER, AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, AND HE'S LIKE, "YOU NEED TO HANG UP AND CALL 911." HE WAS JUST GRABBING THINGS AND THROWING THEM AND THERE WAS JUST NO GETTING THROUGH TO HIM. SAY, "HEY, SLOW DOWN. YOU'RE RUINING YOUR HOUSE OR YOU'RE GOING TO HURT SOMEBODY. SLOW THE HELL DOWN." FINALLY THE COPS CAME AND GRABBED HIM AND TONED HIM DOWN. HE WAS PEPPER-SPRAYED ON THE FRONT PORCH. AND I JUST, I REMEMBER SEEING THAT. I WAS ANGRY WITH THE POLICE FOR TAKING HIM AWAY, I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND, HE WAS MY DAD. HE WAS MY SUPERHERO. HE COULDN'T BE DOING ANYTHING WRONG. I PACKED UP THE KIDS AND TOOK OFF FOR A WHILE. WHEN THEY HAD THEIR LITTLE TRIAL PERIOD THERE, MAYBE THAT SCARED HIM. MAYBE HE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO LOSE HER. THE THOUGHT OF LOSING HER WOULD HAVE DEVASTATED HIM. WE CAME BACK WITHIN A COUPLE OF WEEKS, AND I THINK THAT'S WHEN WE BUCKLED DOWN AND STARTED, YOU KNOW, COMING UP WITH SOME PLANS AS FAR AS WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE NEXT. HE DID SEE THAT HIS ACTIONS, HOW THEY WERE AFFECTING THE KIDS, AND THAT'S WHEN HE WAS GETTING HIS SHIT TOGETHER. THAT'S WHEN HE WAS STARTING TO BE MORE PRESENT AND MORE INVOLVED, NOT MISSING THINGS, MORE RESPONSIBLE. THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS I MISS ABOUT THAT GUY. YEAH, HE DID CARE. NO CONCEPT OF TIME, THAT WAS BOB. BUT HIM WALKING DOWN THE HALL, AND I CAN PICTURE IT IN OUR OLD HOUSE. HE WOULD START AT BROGAN'S ROOM AND HE WOULD SAY - YOU KNOW, THEY CAN BE SOUND ASLEEP OR READING A BOOK, DIDN'T MATTER. "GOODNIGHT BROGITA CHIQUITA. BROGITA CHIQUITA BANANA," GIVE HER A KISS, "I LOVE YOU." THEN HE WOULD GO TO TEA ROSE OR TT LEE, TIERNEY ROSE, HAD TO ANNOUNCE THIS LITTLE GOOFY NAME HE WOULD HAVE FOR THEM, AND SAME THING, "I LOVE YOU," AND A KISS GOODNIGHT. AND THEN INTO DUCKY'S ROOM WITH HIS FAMOUS DUCK CALL AND GIVE HER THE, "I LOVE YOU," AND A KISS GOODNIGHT. AND THE LAST ONE WOULD ALWAYS BE, "JACK, MY BOY," AND THE SAME. "I LOVE YOU. GOODNIGHT." AND HE'D ALWAYS COME IN, "DAN-DAN, BABY," AND I'D GET THE SAME THING. SO WHETHER HE WAS WORKING ON THE CAR OR THE MOTORCYCLE, PUTZING AROUND IN THE GARAGE, OR GOING INTO THE KITCHEN TO MAKE SOME TOAST OR ONE OF HIS FAVORITE LATE NIGHT SNACKS, WE ALL GOT THE "GOODNIGHT, I LOVE YOU." AND THEN HE'D GO OFF AND DO HIS THING OR HE'D JUST GO TO BED. YEAH, THAT ONE ALWAYS GETS ME. OKAY, PULL IT TOGETHER, LET'S GO. WE LEFT THE HOUSE AT AROUND ONE O'CLOCK. IT WAS A HOT DAY, AND WE TOOK OFF HEADING EAST. WE WERE FURTHER DOWN THE LAKE AND WE WERE COMING IN THIS DIRECTION, COMING HERE TO THE RIVER FOR LUNCH. THERE WAS A NOISE COMING FROM THE BOAT. AND HE WAS SIX FOOT FOUR AND TWO HUNDRED AND WHATEVER BENT OVER ON A NINETY FIVE DEGREE DAY OVER THE SIDE OF THE BOAT, WORKING HIS WAY, AND HE WAS MID BOAT WHEN HE GOT TO, YEAH, HE JUST COLLAPSED. HE WAS ON HIS KNEES. THAT'S WHEN I COULD SEE HIS FACE AND I COULD SEE HIS LIPS GOING... HIS LIPS WERE BLACK, HIS LIPS KEPT CHANGING COLOR AND HIS TONGUE, AND I COULD SEE THAT, AND THEY LAID HIM DOWN. AND MY STEPFATHER WAS A POLICE OFFICER, HE STARTED TO PERFORM CPR, DOING DO THE CHEST COMPRESSIONS AND MOUTH TO MOUTH. AND I IMMEDIATELY CALLED 911 AND I COULDN'T FIND, I WAS GET DISORIENTED, I COULDN'T SEE WHERE WE WERE. I KNEW WE WERE PAST THE SANDBAR, I DIDN'T KNOW HOW FAR. IT WAS HARD TO PINPOINT WHERE WE WERE. HIS FACE WAS COMPLETELY BLUE. LIKE HE WAS PURPLE AND BLUE. THAT'S WHY I SAID, "DAD, I LOVE YOU," BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE ABLE TO REMEMBER WHAT MY LAST WORDS WERE TO HIM. I JUST REMEMBER SAYING "BABY, WHERE ARE THE KEYS, I CAN'T FIND THE KEYS." AND HE MANAGED TO TOUCH THE SEAT, SO I KNOW THE KEYS WERE TUCKED IN BEHIND, THEY MUST HAVE FALLEN BACK. I GRABBED THE KEYS AND I DIDN'T... THEY ONLY STARTED THE ONE ENGINE, IT WAS A JET BOAT, I DIDN'T START BOTH ENGINES, AND I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE WEREN'T GOING. AND THEN KAI MADE IT TO THE BOAT, AND IT WAS MY FIRST INTRODUCTION TO KAI, AND HE JUMPED ON THE BOAT AND I GOT ON HIS JET SKI AND HE BROUGHT THE BOAT IN TO SHORE. I WENT TO THEM AND ASKED THEM WHAT'S WRONG. AND THEN DANI SAYS, "CAN YOU BRING THE BOAT IN?" I REMEMBER SCREAMING FOR THE PARAMEDICS AND RUNNING TO THE ROAD AND FLAGGING DOWN THE PARAMEDICS TO GET TO THE SHORE AND HELP ME WITH BOB, GET THEM TO THE DOCK, AND THEN TO GET MY KIDS OFF THE BOAT AND EVERYBODY OUT OF THE WAY. AND I JUST REMEMBER COMING ON SHORE, RUSHING TO THE ROAD, GETTING THE PARAMEDICS TO THE BACK, AND THEN CLEARING OFF THE BOAT, GETTING THE KIDS OFF AND PLACING THEM OVER BY THE FENCE AREA. WE MADE IT TO THE HOSPITAL AND ALL I COULD THINK OF ON THE DRIVE TO THE HOSPITAL WAS CALLING UP PEOPLE TO GET MY KIDS ROUNDED UP. I HAD DECLYN AT A SLEEPOVER, A BIRTHDAY PARTY, AND BROGAN WAS AT THE NEW JOB. AND I WAS SO AFRAID THAT THEY WERE GOING TO HEAR SOMETHING ON THE RADIO. SO I HAD TO GET THEM ROUNDED UP AND GET EVERYBODY HOME AND JUST KEEP THEM PROTECTED. AND THIS WHOLE TIME I DIDN'T KNOW THAT BOB HAD DIED, I HADN'T BEEN TOLD YET. AND THEY CALLED MY MOM INTO A SEPARATE ROOM, AND THE DOCTOR CAME. AND THE DOCTOR CAME IN AND TOLD ME THAT HE DIDN'T MAKE IT. I WAS WALKING UPSTAIRS AND MY PHONE WENT OFF AND SOMEONE WAS LIKE, "I'M SO SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR DAD." AND I WAS LIKE, "WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?" AND THEY'RE LIKE, "I'M SORRY ABOUT YOU DAD. I'M SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT HIM, I'M SORRY THAT HE PASSED AWAY." AND I RESPONDED LIKE, "HE'S NOT DEAD. HE'S JUST IN THE HOSPITAL, HE'S GOING TO BE FINE. HE'S NOT DEAD." BECAUSE THE NEWS OUTLETS HEARD ABOUT IT BEFORE WE DID, SO PEOPLE STARTED TEXTING US. I REMEMBER WALKING IN AND ALL OF THEM IN A LITTLE HUDDLE IN THE FAMILY ROOM AROUND THE COFFEE TABLE, AND THEY ALL LOOKED UP AT ME WHEN I WALKED IN AND ALL I COULD SAY WAS, "YOUR DAD LOVED YOU SO MUCH." AND I COULDN'T GET OUT ANYMORE. "YOUR DAD LOVED YOU VERY MUCH. BUT THEY COULDN'T DO ANYTHING ELSE TO HELP THEM - TO HELP HIM." AND THAT'S WHEN AT THAT MOMENT WE ALL JUST GOT - WE ALL JUST BROKE. AND I WENT OUT BACK AND I STARTED CRYING OUTSIDE. EVERYONE WAS JUST CRYING EVERYWHERE. MY COUSIN WAS THERE, AND WE ALL WERE JUST LIKE, "THERE'S NO WAY. THERE'S NO WAY THAT HAPPENED." HE WAS SUCH A BIG - HE WAS SO FULL OF LIFE AND SUCH A BIG PRESENCE IN OUR LIVES THAT JUST TO THINK THAT, OH, HE'S GONE LIKE THAT. THAT WAS JULY 5TH, 2010. IT WAS A MASSIVE HEART ATTACK. IT WASN'T VERY GOOD. NOT GOOD AT ALL. IT WAS SUCH A SHOCKER. WE DID EVERYTHING TOGETHER. WE'RE ONLY 13 MONTHS APART. HE WAS SOMEONE THAT ALWAYS SEEMED INVINCIBLE, I GUESS. THAT'S WHY IT WAS SUCH A SHOCK WHEN HE DIED. HE ALWAYS SEEMED TO SURVIVE ANYTHING. BUT YEAH, IT'S STILL HARD TO BELIEVE. I WAS SAD THAT HE WASN'T THERE FOR ME GRADUATING COLLEGE OR FOR MY PROM, AND I KNOW A WEDDING ONE DAY, IF THAT HAPPENS, THAT'S DEFINITELY GOING TO BE HARD BECAUSE THERE'S NO ONE THERE TO WALK YOU DOWN THE AISLE, OR TO HAVE THAT FIRST FATHER/DAUGHTER DANCE. SO YEAH, I KNOW THAT IN THE FUTURE AND IF I'M HAVING BABIES AND HE DOESN'T GET TO MEET THEM, AND THEY DON'T GET TO UNDERSTAND HOW COOL OF A PERSON MY DAD WAS, THOSE ARE DEFINITELY THINGS THAT, YEAH, I MISS HIM BEING HERE. YOU'RE JUST LIKE, "WOW, I WISH I HAD HIM TO GIVE ME ADVICE ON THIS," OR, "I WISH I COULD HAVE A HUG," OR, "I WISH I COULD JUST HEAR HIM LAUGH AGAIN." THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS YOU DON'T KNOW, AND YOU EXPECT THAT YOU WOULD NEED HIM TO HELP YOU GROW THROUGHOUT CERTAIN SITUATIONS IN YOUR LIFE, AND EVERY DAY'S DIFFERENT, EVERY DAY YOU CAN - YOU THINK ABOUT HIM MORE, YOU MISS HIM MORE, AND SOMETIMES - IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE IN THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD, BUT SOME DAYS IT'S JUST, "WOW, I WISH I HAD HIM HERE TO GET ME THROUGH THIS DAY." HAVING HIM ABSENT IS DEFINITELY DIFFICULT SOMETIMES, BUT THEN YOU LOOK AROUND AND YOU ARE LIKE, "YOU KNOW WHAT? HE WOULD BE PROUD OF ME REGARDLESS." AND JUST BECAUSE HE'S NOT HERE PHYSICALLY DOESN'T MEAN HE'S NOT LOOKING DOWN ON US, BECAUSE I THINK HE IS.
