It's been a while, hasn't it? Since we've all been together. It really has. Sorry we couldn't do this sooner. Don't worry about it. I'm just glad we can see each other at all. So, summer's come again, huh? A year's come and gone. Ayane. SUMMER GHOST KNOW WHERE TO GO? YA I GOT IT THINK SO I THINK I'M GONNA BE EARLY OMW NOW Are you Aoi? Ah, yeah. Cool. I'm Sugisaki Tomoya. Nice to meet you. You guys are eager. Even I've got five minutes. I'm Ryou. Nice to meet you two. You, too. Okay. Looks like we're all here. Shall we get started? First, let's lay everything out. We all came here today to find a ghost. The Summer Ghost, to be exact. For the past couple years, it's been spotted around here every summer. I hear you've gotta have fireworks. Fireworks? Yeah. Apparently everyone who's seen it was playing with 'em. It's supposedly a woman in her early twenties. She's got long hair and black clothes. If I had to draw her, she'd probably look like this. You're so good. A pretty lady like her, huh? If the rumors are true, this ghost... is the ghost of someone who committed suicide. What's wrong? Oh, it's nothing. Just, I've realized I'm kinda scared of ghosts. This late in the game? Whatever. You don't have to come. I know I'm going. Sorry! I'm just being silly! I'm coming, too! Sure, I'm scared, but it's just a little bit. Oh, actually, why do you want to see this ghost, Tomoya? I mean, you were the one who reached out to us about this. Who knows? Come on! What's that about? Ouch, dude. NATIONAL MOCK EXAM Sugisaki. A, A, A, A, A... Looking good. You never fail to impress me. I wish the other students would learn from you. Thank you. Sugisaki. Yes, sir? You're gonna go far. Tomoya. What are you spacing out for? We're here. Look at all this space! This used to be an airport. Heard it closed down because it wasn't profitable. Guys! Let's get started already. You think this Summer Ghost really exists? Who knows? They do say that fireworks are meant to calm the souls of the dead. I hope they see them, then. Looks like it's a no-show. And we burned through so many, too. Okay. Last one. Could you, Aoi? You know, Tomoya, I actually believed we'd get to see it. I'm kinda sad it didn't show up. Still, though, I haven't had this much fun in a while. I'm glad I got to meet you guys. Seriously, thank you. Damn, that's hot! What was that? Why's it going crazy? She's real. Are you the Summer Ghost? Indeed. To what do I owe the pleasure? What could you possibly want... from someone who's already dead? HARUKAWA - Direct hit! - Your timing's on point, dude. The hell are you doing?! - Don't be stupid! Get down here! - Let go of me! She finally decides to come to school, and we're back to this already? If you ask me, the problem's with her. Do ghosts gang up on each other, too? Hmm, I'm not sure. We might be all on our own, actually. Good. I prefer it that way. I get it. Being around people isn't all smiles. What's wrong? Nothing. Just noticed that the sparkler's still going. You're right. Kinda creepy. Tell me. Are you an outcast at school? Is that why you want to die? Thing is, not everyone can see me. I'm visible only to those... who are within arm's reach of death. So Tomoya and Ryou also... What about you two? Any questions? So Summer Ghost, you're... Satou Ayane. I have a name. So Ayane, you're a ghost, right? Does everyone become one after they die? Dunno. What do you want to know? How do ghosts perceive this world? I'm curious. I wish I could tell you. It's not something so easily explained. Some things you can only understand after you become a ghost. It's about time I get going. It's been fun talking with you. See you. Boo. B-Boo. So ghosts really do exist, huh? DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION That'll be all for today. If something happens, contact me immediately. I will. Your parents not here today? I had them stay at home. No sense bringing them here just to cry. You're working hard, huh? - Kobayashi! - Been a while. Hey, why did you quit playing? Kinda felt like it. You... felt like it? I'm... gonna die soon. What? They say I've got 9 months left. I'll never see the cherry blossoms again. Just kidding. What, you bought it? Oh, come on! Don't scare me like that. You almost had me worried there. Tomoya. I need to talk to you. Tomoya! I know you can hear me. Coming... These are your acceptance odds based on your first trimester mock exams. Your math scores are passable, if barely. Your contemporary literature ones need work, though. You can't just write your own thoughts. You have to follow the rubric. I know you understand that. Why is it just this one thing? WE MIGHT AS WELL USE THIS GROUP CHAT, SO HAVE A CAT STICKER WHAT ARE YOU GUYS UP TO? - NOTHING - AT CRAM SCHOOL You go to cram school even on Sundays? Yeah, since I finish high school this year. Huh? I've still got a year to go after this. - You're older than me, Tomoya? - Really? You're only a junior, then? What, you're older, too? Yeah, but it doesn't matter. We're friends. AOI: I WONDER IF WHAT WE SAW WAS REALLY A GHOST WHAT ELSE COULD IT HAVE BEEN? - DUNNO, A HALLUCINATION? - BUT WE ALL SAW IT MHM... - Hello? - Hello? What's wrong, Aoi? Did something happen? No. Not really. It's just that... I still can't believe what we saw. Don't let it get to you. It'd be weird if you weren't spooked. Tomoya? I'm sorry. I'm almost home, so I'm gonna hang up. Glad it wasn't anything serious. See ya. Heya. Fancy seeing you again. Something tells me you weren't satisfied by our last meeting. Not entirely. You just want it all, don't you? I'm curious. Why are you alive? Do I look alive to you? I'd say so. I don't really feel alive, to be honest. I sometimes wonder whether I'm not already dead. It's because you're dead inside. That's not good for you. Don't wanna hear that from a ghost. So, what are you going to do about it? I don't know. That's what I was hoping to find out. Would all my worries, all my suffering, simply disappear if I became a ghost? I kind of figured something might change... if I learned that. I see. There's only one way to find out. Let's get you out of your shell. Don't you want to fly? Let's go! You ready? Make sure to hold on tight! How is it? Your body's on the ground. But your soul's flying! You've been freed! Awesome. W-Wait! I'm inside the ground? Sorry. I couldn't resist. I wanted to see how you'd react. Th-That's just mean. I said I'm sorry. I'll teach you how to fly. Will that make up for it? Look deep inside you. Find the deepest wish in your heart. Your spirit moves where you wish to be. Think about it. Where do you want to go? EXHIBITION HALL B You like paintings, don't you? I do. I quit making them myself, though. There's more important things in life, after all. So that's why you seem so dissociated. It's such a waste. You're just throwing away this opportunity. You're a ghost right now. No one can get mad at you, you know. Beautiful, huh? All the city lights. You're right. Though it could be brighter, I guess. Since all the lights aren't on at once. Come on, you're not going to win over any girls like that. Just say "thank you", like a normal person. My bad. Hey, may I ask you something? Go ahead. Why did you commit suicide? Tomoya... you've got it wrong. I didn't commit suicide. Are you curious? I'll tell you my story, then. The truth is... I was killed. - Where are we? - This is my house. My mom lives here on her own now. Three years ago, we got into a nasty fight. Over something so incredibly stupid, too. I dashed out of the house into a horrible typhoon. And while I was crossing the street, I was hit by a car that ignored a red light. It's such a stupid way to die. Except, well, that didn't actually kill me. I was simply unconscious at that point. But when I woke up, I was trapped someplace tiny. Probably in a suitcase. But why? To cover up all traces of the accident. The driver of that car buried me somewhere. I couldn't breathe, and the only thing I could hear was a distant train. That's my last memory among the living. My mother still waits for me to return. Where were you buried? I've tried to find that out, but I've long since given up. It's not like it'd change anything at this point. Gosh, there were so many things I still wanted to do. Travel, fall in love... I'm jealous of the bright future ahead of you. But you can travel, no? It wouldn't even cost you anything. Careful. That was really tactless of you. Minus 20 points. Personally, I think you have it better. Tomoya... Yeah? I want... to find my body. It might be possible if you help me. I only gave up on it because... I wouldn't be able to do anything even if I did. I'm sorry. The whole point of this was to cheer you up. Pretend I didn't say anything. Boo. HARUKAWA Shouldn't you be in cram school? Get in. It's already the second trimester. You've been wandering off, haven't you? You can't lie to me. I'm looking for a friend. Excuse me? Is that more important than your future? I'll be coming to your cram school to make sure you're there next week. High time you faced reality. T-Tomoya! Where are you going? We couldn't find it today either. I'm sorry. Why? There's no need for that. Consider this more of a date. I have entrance exams this year. Once I start college, I don't know how much I'll be able to come here. I see. Then let's end our soul-searching journey here. What? Summer is about to end. It's a good stopping point. But we don't need to give up comple... It's fine. I don't want to distract you. You have more important things to focus on than me. - But... - Minus 2.000.000 points. Being stubborn isn't going to win over any girls. I said it's fine. Does that mean you won't be around for much longer? Possibly. Okay, then. I'll see you tomorrow evening. Wait for me, please. Can we meet up? I wanna talk about something. I want to find Ayane's body. Will you help me? I knew it'd be something like that. You've been seeing her a lot lately, huh? What? Really? You in love or something? That's not it. Well, whatever. I'm not helping, either way. Can't bring myself to help someone who killed herself. That's not what happened. She died by no fault of her own. This is really important. If I don't see this through, I think I'll regret it for the rest of my life. That a fact? Well, good luck. - Ryou... - Don't. - Wait! - Seriously, don't! Just drop it. I don't wanna hear it. Must be nice having a future. I don't have that luxury. What does that... Ryou! Did something happen, Tomoya? Nah. Nothing happened. Let's start looking. We'll find your body today. Wait! Ryou! - Ryou! - Go away! Just leave me alone... Damn! It doesn't help that you can't go too far from your body. Still, I won't stop until we find yours. Tomoya. Please, leave me alone. I knew it all along. Meeting up with you guys was a mistake. I would've suffered so much less if I'd just let myself die alone. Why did I do this to myself? Why me? Why is the world so unfair? Ryou... I won't try to pretend I understand, but at least hear me out. I get bullied pretty hard at school. It put me in some dark places. I'd begun to lose hope that... I'd ever understand why I'm even alive. To me, searching for a ghost was a search for new answers. You might be struggling with something completely different, but I'm sure Tomoya's fighting a battle of his own, too. There has to be some meaning in the three of us getting together. No way! Ayane... Ayane! Can you hear me? I wouldn't expect you of all people to come so poorly prepared. Are you even trying, dude? I'm sorry. I was so focused on myself, I didn't consider your situation at all. I hate people like you. You think you've got it all figured out, and yet you look more pitiful than anyone. But I guess I can help you. You better thank Aoi for this. Ryou. Let's get this over with. Thank you. You think we'll find it? Of course. There's four of us now. I didn't think you'd go this far for me. I'm grateful towards all of you. Nothing beats having friends, huh? Make sure to cherish them. Tomoya! Aoi? What's wrong? Come quickly! I think I might've found the suitcase. Look there, Ayane. Thanks. I'll go check it out. I wonder what's gonna happen to her. Will she disappear once she finds her body? That's a little sad. You were right. I'm in there. Great! Let's get back. Yeah! I'm so happy. Hopefully my mom can rest easy now. So you are gonna disappear. I'd expect so. But I had a lot of fun. I made the most of my remaining time here. Tomoya. Hang in there. You have to keep on living. Look. He's finally awake. What are you spacing out for? - Let's go! - Sure... I'm a little worried. You had so much fun while you were a ghost. I hope you haven't started thinking death might not be so bad. My, oh my. I'm sorry for dragging you into this. NO TRESPASSING - Ryou! - I'm fine. Go on without me. Don't make Ayane wait. - It's gotta be here. - Yeah... But how do we get over? You're going through your own thing, and I selfishly dragged you into mine. And after all that, I'm going to move on without you. Don't miss me, please. I... I want to find you, Ayane. That's all that matters right now. Okay. I'm sure that'll give you your answer. For you, death is in the future, for me, it's in the past. It's wedged right between us. Aoi? You take it from here, Tomoya! Let's go. What's wrong, Tomoya? Tomoya! You spent a lot of time detached from your body. That's why you're here right now. This place is death. There's nothing here. But it's also where all of your self is. Once you burn this, it's all over. You'll part with the real world. Yeah. I guess we shouldn't do this. Why do you look so sad? What do you truly want? Tomoya! The hell are you doing?! - Wake up! - Ryou? You wanted to do this more than anyone. So see it through the end! Why would you give up now? Like hell I'm gonna let you! No. I have to go back. Why? What's the point? Why would you cling onto a world that only makes you suffer? Why?! You're right. My life's nothing but a chore. But it's not over yet! Just like Ryou and Aoi, I learned that if you just look up... there's always someone waiting to pick you up. You're not Ayane. You're the part of me that's looking for a reason to die! I need to get back to the real world and find Ayane. My time's going to come one day. Ayane's time has already passed. I've... I've gotta come to terms with those things first! Tomoya! I'm so glad. Thank you for finding me. I'm coming. Ayane? So, summer's come again, huh? How have you guys been doing? Things looking up at all? Yeah. Somewhat. Living for yourself isn't the walk in the park I thought it would be. Same here. Of course my life isn't suddenly all roses, but... How long are you gonna behave like children?! But I feel like I'm taking small steps, at least. Maybe it'd be easier... if I just did what I was told. I do doubt myself sometimes. But it's fine. All things eventually come to an end. Whenever I think that, all my fear disappears. I'll be the one... to make the decisions for myself. Good for you. We're running out of time. I'm glad I got to talk to you guys. Since I didn't get to say goodbye. Why was I even born? That's the only thought that crossed my mind. But I got to see the next spring... because I believed I could be cured. Stop crying over someone who's been dead for months. I'm sure things will work out for both of you. I don't have any proof of that, but I guarantee you they will. Tomoya... Aoi... Live your best lives. Let's head back. Sure.
