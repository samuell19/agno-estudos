I’m Erik. A filmmaking student. What I like about filmmaking is the visual aspect of it. How it gives life to an idea based on the filmmaker's vision. Especially when the storyline is already interesting enough. Just like my life that seemed to be written by a great screenwriter. The conflict is unparalleled, with crazy twist and turns and the ending is unexpected and unfathomable. On how I've chosen this course against my parents' wishes, but I don’t care, for as long as they support me financially. I know they can afford my education. I want to tell disturbing stories. Something that you haven’t seen or heard of before. Stories that would pique one’s curiosity to... to question their validity and authenticity. This is my girlfriend, Tonette. Also a film student in my class. At first, she likes the typical mainstream movies. Films that you already know the story and you don't have to think hard about. But things changed when her politician father got embroiled in a major controversy that caused him to commit suicide. From then on, Tonette changed the kind of films she wants to make. Real life stories, investigative and documentary style of filmmaking. True stories that happens in real life. I want to make movies that are out of the box. Movies that aren’t like our typical mainstream, cliché-type movies we’ve seen a million times. but rather, those that tell stories as they are, truthfully and honestly. And are also, visually appealing and pleasurable to all our senses. This is Orius, a classmate and a trusted friend. He’s younger than me, but I’m awed by the way he thinks. He looks at life beyond his years and makes sure to enjoy life to the fullest. Probably because he’s an only child. He's your typical spoiled brat. Sometimes I think Orius' parents know about his messing around with drugs but they look the other way. That actually works in my favor. Imagine having a confidant and a drug supplier for a friend. I wonder what his drug enforcer dad’s reaction would be if and when his only son gets busted. I hope not. Orius will be put in a different spotlight. What I love about making movies is the glitz and the glam. You’re getting treated as a celebrity. The red carpet appearances. The accolades and adoring fans and the sense of entitlement that comes with all of it. This is Cathy, Orius’ girlfriend. Spontaneous and without a care in the world. She just wants to have fun. She doesn’t care what other people think of her or perceive her to be. She’d rather focus on her artistic and creative passion. Full of colors just like a rainbow. As colorful and as fun as her life, most likely influenced by her parents. A cougar-like mom and a gay dad who both showered her with love. Cathy’s family is the epitome of the new normal, just like her true personality. I like the artistic side of filmmaking. The creative process that goes with it, and with the advent of modern technology that’s used in filmmaking nowadays, there’s just so much that we can do to make a masterpiece. This is Joyce. A fashion stylist and said to be Cathy's bestfriend. But the truth is, they’re having a secret affair right under Orius' nose, but that's not my business. That’s their problem. When I first saw her, I thought she has a weak personality because she’s quiet... but boy was I wrong. She was orphaned at a young age and grew up with her religious grandmother who has no idea about her true sexuality. In filmmaking, Joyce is free to show her real character without judgement. Making movies somehow lets me explore my true sense of sexuality. Through fashion styling, I get to showcase the real me. It reflects in how I style the actors. And also, it pays well. This is Adolf, Orius' cousin from overseas. He’s got a different way of thinking so we jived right away. He’s got out of this world interests. Maybe because of his upbringing and lifestyle. He is who he is. No pretensions and prejudices, open minded and easy to get along with. It’s fulfilling being in front of the camera and seeing yourself on the big screen, It kind of makes you want to do more movies. Assess your strengths and weaknesses to really grow as an actor. Making a film is like creating your own world. You develop and give life to a character based on how you want it to be. You have the power to manipulate how your story unfolds. And you get to decide the plot turns as you see fit. Your imagination is limitless. Your mind is your own world. That’s exactly me when I’m high on drugs. I can easily think up concepts. My imagination goes wild. Okay. What you just saw is “Kinatay”. A film by one of our most prolific directors, Brillante Mendoza. Do you have any comments on the film? Anybody? Erik. Well... I like the film. I think the cinematography was on point. The message was obviously there. But... overall it’s just really not my type of film. Okay, fair enough. Anybody else? Yeah, Orius. Sir, honestly... I don’t like the film. I don’t like his work. It’s just... another poverty porn. Exploitative. His camera work is a mess which makes it hard to watch. It’s boring. Okay. Tonette. Sir. I think the cast did a great job and the pacing somehow puts you in the film. But personally, the subject matter is a bit too dark for me. And I personally would not watch this film in my free time. Okay, what I’m hearing from you… You’re telling me the impact the film has had on you. What you feel about it. What I’m not hearing is your assessment of what the film means. I would just suggest when you watch films, go and try to check what the filmmaker might be trying to say. And how do you do that? By checking, looking, investigating, reflecting on his creative choices. The directing options that he has taken in various things, like you’ve got cinematography, the composition of characters in the frame. What is he saying about the relationships? Basically, who is the one weakened, or minimized in the frame. So you can have a sense of what the filmmaker, even outside the dialogue, what the filmmaker is trying to say about the relationship… They are talking about this faux cinema, and they said that these people usually become filmmakers after and... Can you just make sure that the students check in on time, and everybody... Go talk to him. - When will we get the lamps? - It'll be there tomorrow. Yes, thank you. - I'll see you. - See you later. Sir! Yeah? This is my final presentation for my thesis. Okay. We’re getting there. We’re all set to shoot. Okay, so you’re completely ready? You have access to the tribe? Everybody that you have to see- Yes, sir. you've gained their permission? Yes, sir. Logistics. Everything. We have a guide... What about your post production, editing sched? You only have one month to finish this documentary. One month to put it together. Are you prepared for that, if your contacts give different info? And they will determine the story of the documentary? - Is a month enough? - Yes, we can do it, sir. By the way, I’ll introduce you to my team. This is my girlfriend and production manager, assistant director, Tonette. And Orius! This is my soundman, Sir. So with this team, for sure, we’re gonna make it. Okay, I’ll see you guys. - Thank you, sir! - Take care. Yes! See? I told you. - You guys ready? - Yeah, I'm ready. I'm all packed and ready. - Let’s go. - Game? Hey! - What's up? - Hi! Do you have plans tonight? Nothing bro. I have to go home first. I have to fix some things for my thesis. I’m thinking we should go party later. Let’s have a little celebration before you guys leave. - l'll go. - Join us. Tonette? I mean… Come on, let’s go! I’ll call you. - Call? - Yeah, I’ll call you. Just need to fix this thesis stuff first. You know, I need to do this. - Alright! Just message me then. - Okay. See you. Take care! Bye! Yes! Hello. Hello. What are you drawing here? Abstract. Ah, it's abstract. Okay... Interesting. Hello. What are you drawing here? It's a rainbow. It is very colorful. - Not bad, right? - Yes, it's not bad. - You can go on, it's good. - Thank you. Okay? What is it? I'm trying a slightly shimmering green. I'm preparing the paints. What is that? That speaker was funny, right? When he pushed the button a different slide appeared. I can’t stop laughing earlier. Did you notice it? Nope, I wasn’t able to see it. Really? It was so funny! Mom? Dad? Can I borrow the van? We’ll go to Mindoro. Mindoro? What are you going to do there? We’re going to shoot our thesis. You’re just wasting your time. You’re not getting any younger. What will you get from that film? Erik, you wasted four years of pre-med. Enzo already graduated before you. You have to think! What will you do when we’re gone? I told you many times, I’m not happy in med school! - Don’t be ridiculous! - What the fuck! Is it me- Don’t talk to us that way! I didn’t raise you to be disrespectful to your parents! Erik! Bro. Where are you at? Let’s meet at the club. Huh? It’s too early. I’m so pissed. I wanna get out the house. Okay. I’ll be there. Can I bring my cousin with me? Alright. [Speaks in Filipino] Dolf, come with me later. Sorry, what? - I mean go with me later. - Yeah, sure. - To the bar. - Yeah sure, sounds good. Did you speak Provincial Commander? They should manage their operations better. We have to keep the public's trust. We can’t mess this up. Yes, sir. We talked about it in the meeting. So far, there’s no problem. Just stay there for a sec. Mom, I’m going out with Adolf. Where are you guys going? - At my friend’s house. - Okay. I’ll use your car. Why? You have your own car. But mom we won’t fit. Okay. Be careful. - Take care of your cousin. - I love you. Hey, guys! Who’s this new face? This is my bestfriend, Joyce. - Hello, Joyce. - I’m Jay. - I’m Joyce. - What’s up? Hi, Joyce! So what are we celebrating tonight? So... I need to shoot a film for my thesis. It’s gonna be a short documentary, - so I’ll need you, - Sure. - and of course you. - Of course. So can you guys help me. Of course. Babe, come with us. It’s gonna be fun! - Yeah, sure I'd help out. - You’re a stylist, right? - Yeah, she’s into fashion design. - She’s what we need. Game! I'm down. By the way, Adolf here, can be our narrator. Definitely! His accent is perfect! - I thought you were joking about that. - No. Oh, okay. - Too bad I can’t join you guys. - Yeah, he’s busy. But you know maybe, if I change my mind. - Joyce will join in. - Really? When are we leaving? ASAP! - Okay. I’m in! - Great! Okay, let’s take some shots! Let's go! Let’s take some shots to kick off this night. Cheers! Go straight, then right left, right left. No, we’re here. We’re here. - We’re here? - No! It’s here. Babe, get the ecstacy. Be careful, babe. How about Elmer’s five million pesos? When are they going to pay? Sir, I already talked to them. They promised to settle next week. Just stick to the game plan, alright? Don’t fuck it up. Be wary of Col. Medrano. Sir, I talked to our contact. Next transaction will be bigger. That’s better. Lock the gate on your way out. Yes, sir. What are you doing with your life? Please don’t! Shame on you! I'm sorry, Mom! Please Dad, stop! I'm sorry. Try it! This is good shit! Orius always gets the good stuff. I'm so bombed. - Jay, is this the right way? - Straight ahead. Just go straight. Come in! Nobody’s home. The place is all ours. Oh, couch. Wait! Here’s the finale. The bomb! Erik, share that with us! - You want more? - Of course! Cheers! This is so good! It’s hard for me to connect with people, even classmates, friends or those who are constantly around me. Maybe I’m just afraid to accept what I'm able to give. In times that I feel that I’m not in this world, are the times when I feel so alive! When it gets dark... my world brightens up. And when I think I'm weak that’s when I get the courage. Orius... He may be wrong, but he knows what he’s doing and he can laugh at himself. He does whatever makes him happy. Notwithstanding the consequences. Tonette... She feels alone in this world. She’s on her own, maybe that’s why we click. As much as she tries to be strong and confident, I feel her vulnerabilty. I'M SORRY... I LOVE YOU BOTH. My family is complete but it's hard to say I'm whole. There’s something missing that I can’t explain. Sometimes I feel all alone, even if I’m with them. Hey, mom! Have you eaten? Did mom eat already? No. She hasn’t even slept. Please serve breakfast. Mom, let’s eat. The food is ready. Come on, join me. Mom? Mom? I’ll be leaving by the way. We’re going to Mindoro for two to three days. I’ll help Erik with his thesis shoot. I’ll be gone for few days. I’m not gonna be here. What mom? You can’t even look at me? You don’t even notice me? Why do I feel like I’m always alone? I know it’s painful what happened to dad, but I’m here. You still have a daughter. Do I mean nothing to you? Am I not important to you? I’m still your daughter. You're still my mother. Why am I all alone? Do I still have a mom? Are you still there? Bro, what’s up? Alright. See you at the gas station. Okay. Bye. Sir, I already talked to my husband. He’s got everything prepared for you. Your lodging is already set as well. My child Marco will accompany you to the mountain. - Okay, Sir. Take care. - Okay. Thank you, Nita! Dad, I’ll be going now. - You eat first. - I’m good. I’m gonna be late. They’re already waiting for me. Dad, thanks for letting me borrow the van. Look out for mom and dad. Take care. You might’ve left your wallet again. Nope. I already have it. Take care. Babe! Get ready alright? Where should I pick you up? At your Mom’s, or your Dad’s house? Alright. See you! Hello bro, we’re getting ready. Just a bit late. Let’s meet at the gas station. Where is it near again? Ah yeah, SLEX exit. Okay, bye. Adolf, we’re late man. Come here! Alright, alright. Mom, dad, we’re leaving. That place is far. Look after your cousin. Don't worry, I will. - Hey Adolf, take care and enjoy, okay? - Yeah, of course. Take care. Don’t get into trouble. - Yes, dad. - Where will you guys meet? Just at the gas station before SLEX exit. Bud! Can you drive them, please. - But come back right away. - Yes, Sir. - Take care. - Alright, mom. Bye. - Dad... - Take care. Adolf... Okay let’s go, we’re late. Joyce, can you please bring the sunblock? We need it. Yeah, I got it. Also, the mosquito repellant. So we don't get mosquito bites. - Already here. - Okay, good. Too much stuff. Please bring a big bag. Hi, Mom! Good morning! Thank you! Hi, Jao! How many days will you be there? Erik said, we’ll be back in one to two days. So it will be quick. I’ll be back in no time. - Alright, one to two days, okay? - Yeah. - Let’s go eat some breakfast. - No, I’m okay. I left my make-up at dad’s place so I have to go. Okay, get it. Enjoy your breakfast. Hey, Jao, I’ll return your earphones when I get back to Manila, okay? - Sure! No problem. - Thank you! Joyce! Joyce, I'm going down. We have to stop at dad’s place first. Okay, I’m done. I’ll get out now. Okay, be quick please. I’ll go downstairs now. It's like a flashback in time. Look at these houses. Do you think we'll stay there? I hope not. How long is it going to take? Maybe a couple of hours. - Are you good? - Yeah. What’s tired in tagalog? Tired? “Pagod”. I'm tired. [CHATTERING] [CHATTERING] [CHATTERING] Hey! Boss! You might’ve forgotten something, boss. Oh right! Is this alright? - Is that enough? - Thanks. Let's go. - Hey guys! What’s up? - Slowpokes! What took you so long? Sorry my dad’s bodyguard-- Babe, is it okay if you let Orius sit in front? Bro, let’s do some tracking shots for the docu. - Is it okay, babe? - No problem. - So where do we go? - Let’s pick-up Cathy. Yup, that’s the place. Dad! Hello, come in. - Hi! - Right on time. Get some food. - Hi, Dad! - Get some food. Is that adobo? Take your seat, let’s eat. - Good afternoon! - Where have you been? I’m with my friends. Dad, I told you we’re leaving right? You look so cute today. Buttering me up again? Can I get my allowance? - Your mom didn’t give you any? - No. Here, drink some water first. Thank you. It’s hot outside. Here, is that enough? Spoiled? - Be careful, okay? - Yes. - Uncle... - Go and eat first. You cooked this? Nope. Your dad. It’s the reason I’m gaining weight. I haven’t been working out lately. It’s your dad and his delicious food’s fault. That’s what happens when you’re inlove. He’s not going to be sexy anymore! He's still sexy in my eyes. I have to go. Thank you! Thank you, dad. - You guys take care. - Yes. - Call when you arrive. - Yes, I’ll do that. Thank you. - Love you, dad! - Love you! Hi, Adolf! Hi. Hi, guys! Guys, let's pick up first our vitamins. Cathy, can your source be trusted? I promise, he’s alright. He’s got the good shit. I promise. - Is this what I ordered? - Yes. - Are you sure? - Definitely. - I will message you. - Okay, thank you. Babe, get Mang Leo’s number from my phone and contact him. Okay, I'm doing it now. So they’re prepared when we arrive. Look, there's a car crash. That's why traffic is bad. Oh, shit! Oh, no! Look! Do you see? Oh man, that sucks! Oh my God, he can’t get out. Mommy! Joyce, are you okay? - Yeah, I’m okay. - You sure? - Promise. - You don’t look okay. I’m okay, I promise. PORT OF BATANGAS Whoa. First, we shoot the intro upstairs. Babe, you tell Adolf what to say. - Follow us, okay? - Of course. Set it up already. There are many islands that comprise the entirety of the Philippines. One of which is the island province of Mindoro. Home to the indigenous people of the Banyan tribe. Now in order to get to Mindoro, we’re going to be travelling on a ferry, which will be taking us from Batangas port to Calapan port. So following that, we’ll be on our way, and we’ll get introduced to everyone. We’re just going to be travelling for the next three hours [STUTTERING] What else would you want me to say? - It’s starting to rain here… - Cut! - It’s raining. - That's good. - Let’s take a break guys. - Guys, let’s secure the equipment. Yeah, the camera might get wet. And because it’s raining... There it is. This is what we need when it rains. So good... Ma’am, sir, that’s not allowed here! You want me to report you? - We’re sorry! - Sorry, bro. We’re sorry! It feels really good to fly. Free as bird. Not a care about the world as long as you’re feeling ecstatic and euphoric. It’s liberating! We never learn. Funny but true. Some things are already part of our system so you can’t ignore them, nor get rid of them. As the saying goes, "Old habits die hard". Looks fun back there. Oh, shit! Hey, fuckers! Oh, fuck! Fix yourselves! Hey! Spray some air freshener. Do it now! I’ll do the talking. Behave. Hide the weed. Good day, sir, open the windows down, please. Good day, sir. Open the windows down, please. - Are you guys okay? - Yes, sir! We've been trying to pull you over but you keep ignoring us. Sorry sir, we didn’t notice because of the loud music. Sir, can you step out of the car, please. Why, sir? - Just stay in the car. - Why, sir? Seems like he doesn’t want to cooperate partner. - All of us? - Driver first. My partner will check the others. Okay, sir. Go to the other side. Just stay there near the car. Where are you guys going? We came from Manila, sir. Probably because we’re tired. You guys were zigzaging on the road. - How about the others? - Okay, stay there. - How many are you? - Do we need to go down? We’re six, sir. - Okay, round them up. - Yes, sir. Stay here. We didn’t do anything wrong. Nobody's in the car? None. Are you sure? Have you seen anything inside the car? Marijuana or something? I’ll check. Please take a look. Look in the middle. Please double check. Sir, it’s positive. Positive? Yes, it’s marijuana. I already smelled you when you opened the window. As my partner have seen, you have drug paraphernalia in there. You have to go with us to the station. Alright, sir. - You have any weapons with you? - No, we don’t. - Can I get my bag first? - No. You can get it later. Search them before they get in. I told you to hide all of them. We’re going to get locked up. How about school? - We won't go to jail. - How about your thesis? We’re not gonna get locked up. I didn't know that the police was following us. We can’t hear because of the music. Okay. English please! What happens now? - We don’t know. - Fuck if I know, we might go to jail. We’re going to die? Die? No! People get murdered for drugs. It’s not a joke. Let’s go inside the station. Sir, please-- Let’s just talk inside. - Sir maybe we can-- - Let’s just talk inside. Let’s just talk inside. Take your seats first. Sergeant, please book them. Sit. - Where did you arrest them? - At Barangay Batuhan. - Process them alright? - Yes sir. Fingerprints, mugshots… - then take this to the lab. - Yes, sir. So we can file a case. Sir, maybe we can just talk this out? Talk this out? Do you know you’re carrying illegal drugs? We’re strictly implementing Republic Act 9165. You will get jail time. Sir, we’re only here for a thesis. Thesis? Why do you have drugs? Where are you bringing those? Sir, we’re supposed to shoot for my thesis film. What kind of thesis is that? It’s a short documentary about Banyan, sir. Banyan? Banyan? I’m also a Banyan. Don't you think that's bad for my tribe? What are you guys thinking? We’re not gonna bring it there. - It’s not for them. - It's only for our use. - Alright, lock them up. - Yes, sir! Follow me. - Lock them up. - Yes, sir. Sir, can I make a call? Can I? - Sure, it's your right. - Can I make a call? Maybe you can let this go, please. - Hello? - Hello, mom? Mom, I need your help. Why? We’re here at the police station. Why are you there? What did you do? We got caught with drugs. My goodness! And you have Adolf with you! My god! Please, mom. Call dad, please. Orius, you never learn! Ma, I need your help. Please call dad. Okay. I’ll call your dad. Hello, hon... Hon, your son got detained in Mindoro. His friend got caught with drugs. Help them please, hon. What did they do? I don’t know. Please find a way. Okay. Relax. I’ll call him. Please dad, please? - Hello dad? - Orius! What bullshit did you get into this time? Are you that stupid? Dad it wasn’t mine. It was my friend’s. Just got caught up in it. What’s the investigator’s name? Chief Abedes. Chief, he wants to talk to you. - Who’s that? - My dad. Your dad? What does he do? He’s a police major. Hello? Abedes, this is Major Martin Plana of PPF Drug Enforcement Agency. I was told my son and his friends are in your custody. Can you brief me about what happened? Sir, we caught them with illegal drugs. It's quite a lot. Is that so? Abedes, right? Can you do me a favor? Can you let this go for me? Alright, Sir. I’ll get your phone number. 0-9-1-6 6-3-6-3-2-8-3. Okay, I’ll call you later. Thank you. Okay, let’s put the processing on hold. Thank you, chief. Let them out of the cells. - Hurry up. - Yes, Sir. Thank you, sir. We’re really sorry. Mang Leo, we’re heading out, where are you? I'm just going to pick up someone here. Mang Leo? I'm here, sir! Sir, why are you here? What happened? I’ll tell you about it later. Let’s go. Okay. Are you okay? Just follow me. I’ll bring you to the resort. Sir, thank you! Edmund, come here. Monitor them, okay? - I don’t trust these guys. - Sure, boss. I’ll be on it. The cop told me to get out. I told you not to. It reeked of marijuana, of course, I’ll comply. - Guys! - Who smoked it first? - You! - Me? No, it was you! Erik wanted to smoke first. I wanted to smoke? Wasn’t it you who brought them? You said you wanted to smoke! Guys stop! Okay? - All of us— - At least we got out safe. - Yes, but all of us- - Atleast, we're here now. We're lucky my dad got us out! You wanted to smoke and we told you not to go down. But you still did. And you too, babe! What could have I done? Should I have resisted? What if he points a gun at me? Maybe you should’ve just run past them. You think they won’t chase us? - Those are cops! - Guys we’re okay now. Let’s just go to the resort. At least we’re going somewhere safe now, someone we know and trust. We'll be fine. Alright? No reason to fight. - Hello. - I’ll go get your stuff. - We also have more at the back. - That was tiring. Welcome. I'll help with your stuff. Yes, thank you. - How was the trip? - It was okay. Let’s go here. Thank you. - Sir Erik... - Yes, Mang Leo? This is my son Marco. He’s going to take care of you here, He'll also handle the food you need. Then you can rest early. Just relax and enjoy. You can take a rest now. Thank you. If you need anything, just tell Marco. - Thank you! - I’ll go now, sir Erik. Sorry we bothered you. Don’t worry about it. You are our guests. We’ll take care of you guys! See you guys! My body is aching. Oh my God, what are you doing? We’re going for a swim! You’re crazy! Those boys are crazy! Look at these two. - Are you taking a video? - Yes! Good. Ah it’s nice! - The water’s great! - I could tell. Babe. Babe, what can you say about Erik as director? You as a director? I think you have great potential. I think you’ll reach really great heights. And you’ll accomplish anything if you put your mind into it. You’ll be you own director, you’ll have your own aesthetic, unlike Brillante Mendoza and all those other directors. You’ll make you own name for yourself. I know it. Now, your turn. What do you think about Antonette as a director? Antonette as a director… I think you’ll make a name for yourself in the indie world. Because of your personality, you’re outside of the box type of person. And... you don’t follow the formula. I don't know. Great things are coming for you. I’m sure. And I’ll be there to support you. Thanks, babe! Cut! It’s really nice here. How are you and Orius doing? We’re okay. He makes me happy. Do you love him? Maybe... I don’t think it’s anything serious. You know Orius, he doesn’t take anything seriously. How about you and your grandma? Same as before. Pray in the morning, pray in the afternoon until night time. Sometimes I don’t even know what she’s praying about. What happened to my parents, or what happened to me? Why? What's wrong with you? You already know that. I can’t come out to her. I think she’ll accept you one day. I hope so. How about us? What about us? Is it nothing serious as well? Joyce, we’re happy as is, right? I don’t want to complicate what we have. Let’s just enjoy whatever this is. Just like I use art as an outlet for my problems. I think it’s best if we take life not too seriously. Just live day by day. Right? Hi, babe! Say, hi! Oh, my God! You’re crazy! Hi! Marco, can’t you get us some? Of what, sir? Marijuana. That's illegal, sir. How old are you? My dad will get mad at me. I'm only 22. - Come on, I won’t tell him. - I’m really sorry sir. I really can’t. Okay. If you find any, let me know. You know where we are. - I’ll go ahead, sir. - Alright. What? We have no drugs. I have a surprise. Look. Do you see this? Fucker! You’ve been keeping that? - Can we just drink instead? - No, Adolf. Is that for real? Really? Really? Do you have anything else? Maybe you’re hiding more stuff. Come on! Hold on. Here. Game! Do we have more? Don’t do your thesis anymore, just do porn. Guys, double check the equipment. Hope we don't leave anything. Actually we shouldn’t. We shouldn’t leave anything because it might be a long walk. Check the SD cards, batteries, everything. - Did you bring extra batteries Orius? - I have here. This is pretty far. We don’t have phone signal as well. It’s good that we have a car but some people have to walk this all way. - I can't even imagine that. - Stop complaining. - Sir Erik, this is our stop. - Why Mang Leo? The road is under repair. It's muddy here. Our car can't go down. We’ll be walking from here. Be careful, sir. We’re going to pass through. We have some visitors. - Here? - Yes. Give it to me. Hold on to this. Careful. It’s slippery. How about when it rains, Mang Leo? When it rains here, how do they go down? - They use their motorcycles. - Really? Good morning to all of us! Let’s give them with a round of applause. Good morning. Welcome to our school here in Calatagan. - Thank you. - Good morning. This is Erik. - They’re going to film here. - Wow! That’s nice! - We just wanted to get permission. - Sure. Come in! Come here. Joyce, can you put their lapels on? Ma'am Adela, thank you for being here. Sir Erik, this is Ma'am Adela. - She’s going to help us-- - Good morning. Come here. They’re going to talk to your fellow Banyans. They’re going to shoot their thesis. - Our valedictorian is a Banyan. - Is that so? Your valedictorian is a Banyan? - Yes. - Really? They study here as well? - They can understand the language? - Of course. Amazing. Please remain standing for the prayer. We’re gonna do a stand-upper. So you just basically tell anything about the school but you have to emphasize that there’s a valedictorian student here and that student is a Banyan. And because of this, we will live the vision of our school. Drive to succeed and overcoming challenges, to ensure that we finish our studies. No need to be nervous, no need to worry because we come from this elementary school, where our characters are molded by our great teachers to be ready for the challenges in life. To my fellow graduates, I know there are more graduations that we'll be attending in the future. Whatever route we’re taking in life, let’s not hesitate to ask guidance from God. Happy graduation to all of us. Now we proceed to the handing out of diplomas. Sir Erik, I’ll be going to town for now. - Ma'am Adela will be assisting you. - Okay. She will guide all of you. - Is it far? - Not really. It’s close by. Edmund! Come here! This is Edmund, he’s also a Banyan. Let's go. - Sir, I’ll come back this afternoon. - Thanks Mang Leo. Take care. - Ma'am Adela will help you out. - Okay, Thank you! It's near. Anyone got a cover for the camera? This might get damaged before we arrive. Do we have an umbrella? Hey, let’s cover this. I think I have a jacket. - The fuck! - Ma'am Adela, I thought it’s close by. Yes, we do this everyday. Sorry, I didn’t think it would be like this. We’re all in this together. Sorry! A lot of mosquitos! - It's slippery. - We’re almost there. We can do this! - What happened? - It's muddy. - Joyce, just a bit more. - We're almost there. So muddy. - Are we there yet, Ma'am? - Yes, we’re nearby. Are they the Banyans? Good day. - Hello. - Hi. We're almost there. - Are we here? - Yes. Grandma Ason, we have visitors. Good morning. They are students from Manila. - Grandma Ason, serves as our chief here. - Good morning. Hi! Students from Manila. Hello. Why aren't you wearing loincloths? Isn’t that supposedly your clothing? Well, times have changed. This is how we dress now. I think we got it wrong, babe. So, these are all your houses? You live here as well? Yes, this is where we live. We have small houses for each family. When we did our research your houses are- Cathy- Here in Mindoro, we have different tribes, and many Banyan members have also graduated from school. I think we shouldn’t have come here. We thought it was like this. Yes, before. But we've become civilized now. Babe, I think our research is wrong. Our research is not wrong, we just got the wrong tribe. Grandma Ason, they’ll be shooting here by the way. - Shooting? - Yes. What will we shoot here then? What shooting? We’re going to shoot a documentary for my school project. We’ll be filming your way of life, your tribe wearing loincloths, your culture... I see. That’s fine. - Can you still wear the loincloths? - Yes. We wear that during occasions and festivities here in our tribe. Just for his thesis. Can we make you wear them? - Sure. - So we can capture it on camera. But... ...have a drink and rest for a while. Alright. Thank you again. Come in. - Be careful. - Take a rest, guys. [CHATTERING] Grandma Ason, we want to interview you about your tribe's culture. How you go about your life, where you get your water, food, do you have a market here? - You explain to them. - Thank you. We can talk about that later. Drink your tea first. That’s the tea we serve here. It comes from Banlas leaves. Sweet! That drink will calm you especially coming from that long trek. It will refresh you. Get some. It tastes good. We have more. It's really good. You know we have a tradition here when we have visitors. Edmund, show them our Cariño dance. Camera rolling. Grandma Ason, help my daughter-in-law please! She’s having convulsions! Let’s help them. Can we film it? Let’s go. Help please! Help please! Help! Alex, quickly, get Banlas leaves. She’s being posessed by the devil. Take a deep breath. Does it hurt? Does it hurt? Roll sideways. Fucking shit! It’s full. Get the SD card! - Continue recording the audio. - Why didn’t you bring the bag? - Take a deep breath. - Babe, double time please! Hold her tightly. Keep recording. Babe! We need the card please! Double time! [CHANTING] Here it is! [CHANTING] We should always bring the bag. How pitiful. Record it. She’s getting calm. The evil spirit is gone. - Grandma? - She’s already calm. Grandma? Thank God. Excuse me. We're unable to film it. Is it okay if we do it again? What? The one where you were trying to cure her, we weren't able to film it. Can we repeat that if possible? - Maybe just the part where she screams, - Same as before. and when you were using the leaves, then... Whatever’s natural for you. - Just do it naturally. - Just like what happened earlier. - What we did was real. - I mean yes, we get it. We’re just asking if... - Wait up, guys. - I'm sorry. We’re just asking if you can reenact the process of healing her. - Let’s just cure the scene. - Kids... do you know what you’re asking of us is difficult? It’s not our fault you didn’t capture it. He’ll teach you. - You instruct her. - Please Grandma, we’ll make it quick. Is it okay? Grandma? Grandma? What do you think? There. Looks like she will do it. - Audio ready? - Okay, move away guys. Camera… sound… ready! Guys, stay out of frame so only them will be captured. Okay, Grandma, anytime you're ready. Okay, let out a scream. Just rub it on. Scream! Can she do it? Can you scream louder? Like this! Just like that. Just like earlier. Let’s do it from the top. More. Louder. There... Just rub it on. ...and cut! Perfect! Thank you! - That was great! - Thank you, Grandma. Can I also ask? What is that called? This is the Banlas leaf. This is what we used for the tea we served to you earlier. It can be used as herbal medicine and has a calming effect. But if not done right, it can be poisonous. It can cause death. Okay. I think we're done here. Let’s go out first. Let her rest. Thank you. Can I ask about the dance earlier? We didn't finish shooting it. Can we do it again? We’ll instruct you, also wear loincloth? Since you told us that you can do that when there are visitors. You told us earlier, you can still wear that. - Grandma? - Alright. So we are here with the Banyan tribe people who have welcomed us with a traditional welcoming dance. Now this particular dance is being hosted by a couple soon to be wed and the daughter of the local tribeswoman. This is a very sexualized dance in the fact that they haven't actually consumated at this moment in time. Edmund, where are the Banlas leaves? The water is boiling. Here it is. How do you get your food here? Do you hunt for animals? Or what? Our men take care of that. We chose good hunters who gather food for us like deer and other animals. They hunt in the surrounding forest. How about your clothes? Where do you wash them? We wash them at the stream. We bring our dirty clothes there and other things that needs washing. How about the rituals? Does Banyans have rituals? Some of our rituals is when we want to talk to the spirits of our ancestors, if we want to say something. But the highest ritual is when we call our god, Binuhi. To give thanks or when we’re asking for something. There are certain conditions that must be met before we do it. The surroundings must be quiet and should be at night. Let’s finish this today. Let’s shoot everything so we don’t have to go back. How can we go back at night? There’s no electricity here. Can your camera keep up? We need to finish this since we’re already here. Just a little bit more. This is the highlight of the thesis. - Do you want to go back tomorrow? - We need to finish this. Thank you! - Just a little more, we can finish this. - My shoes are muddy already. Don’t worry, I’ll buy you new ones. Just a bit more patience. Straight ahead. Go on. Release it first, pretend you can’t catch it. The sun’s out. How about our continuity? - Zip it guys! I can hear you talk. - It's okay. This is a docu, right? Let’s get the reverse shot. Let’s move. - Adolf can you— - Yeah sure. Just spot me. Action! Here! Fuck! Shit! Hey, quiet please! - The camera! - Wait! Cut! From the top. This is where we wash our clothes. The stream is a little bit further away. That's where we get our drinking water. Babe, you go first. Slowly. - Babe, let’s do establishing shot first. - Let's do establishing shot. Orius, let’s go. - Adolf, can you move here on the right? - Let's go here. The metal basin doesn’t look natural. You're right. Wait, I’ll talk to them. Cathy, can you find something else we can use? Can we remove the metal basin? - How about this one? - Is that okay? - That’s a native tray, you put food on it. - I think that’ll work. Joyce... Cathy let’s go. You can also use rocks. It’s better if you remove your tops so it looks natural. So we can also show the traditional clothes you wear. We’ll make it quick. Also them. Be careful. Will she not use this? She'll use that. - Give me the clothes- - The older woman as well, Erik? Yes! Rolling! Three, two, one... Action! - Just continue washing. - Don’t look here. Use the wood. Hit it. So for once, it seemlessly an undless river... We are here just a little bit further down on where the Bangyan tribe settle. What’s interesting here is traditionally they’ll be washing their laundry here. In addition, because this is the only source of running water nearby, they also bathe here as well. Very interesting. Guys, you want a banana? Bro, you should try banana here in Mindoro. They have the best bananas here. [CHATTERING] I'll just go to the toilet. [CHATTERING] Can I use the toilet? Sure, come in. Where is it? Just go straight then turn right. Thank you. Guys, I'll just go to the toilet. She's inside. - Let’s go skinny dipping, Adolf! - Okay. Mela? Edmund... - I thought you were using the toilet. - I was. - What is he doing here? - I'll just use the toilet. Chill. Thank you! Grandma Ason. These look good. - Are they ripe already? - Yes, they’re newly picked. You’re done already? Come, get inside. - Thank you! - That was fast. [CHATTERING] Ma'am Adela, can we have some of that good tasting tea? It's relaxing. Sure. Mela, make some tea, please. Sure. - Can I help her out? - Sure. I’ll just leave it here for a while. - I’ll just help her out. - Sure. Grandma... Can we perform the ritual now? Can we do something about it? We have to leave before nighttime. We can only do it at night. - Can’t we do it now? - We can’t still be here by night. Just boil the water… Can we do something about it? No. We can only perform the ritual at night. Here’s a token for all the help you gave us. Just a little bit to thank you for your help. You know we don’t asking for payment. No, this is just to show gratitude for everything. - For the inconveniences… - Okay, thank you. Thank you, Grandma. - So I think we can do the ritual tonight. - Yes. Alright then. Thank you! Hey! You piece of shit! - Erik, look! - Edmund! Motherfucker! Hey! Asshole! Come here! - You know we’re just guests here, right? - I was just helping! Asshole! Come here! I was just helping her make some tea! Motherfucker! - Babe, stop it! - Pull yourself together! - I was just helping! - I don’t give a shit! - We’re just guests here! - Please stop! - Let’s go outside. - Calm down, alright! Please get out first. - What now? Asshole? - Stop it, babe! - Piece of shit! - Babe, please. - Come here! - Stop it! You’re just a visitor, stop making trouble! - Edmund, hold them off now! - Come here! - What was that about? - We’re just visitors… Bro, I didn’t get to punch him! - Babe! - We're just visitors... - You have to calm down. - Just breathe! - We'll leave soon. - Just breathe. That's enough. Sorry, Grandma... You know, just bunch of kids. - They’re just tired. - We’re very sorry. He's just tired. Please tell Edmund, we’re sorry. We’ll talk to him when things calm down. Sorry, guys. I didn’t handle that well. It's over. Let’s forget about it. Yes, Grandma. Sorry again. Here, drink some tea. Thank you. Place it there, please. Drink this so you can calm down. Drink to cool your heads off. Babe you need this. - Is it soothing? - Yes. Drink up so you can relax too. You’ll share? Me too, I need to relax. Let’s double check equipment so we can set up fast tonight. - Change batteries, cards... - Yeah, I brought extra. We don't have drugs anymore. [CHANTING RITUAL PRAYER] [CHANTING RITUAL PRAYER] What did they make us drink? I don't know but this is good shit! [CHANTING RITUAL PRAYER] [CHANTING RITUAL PRAYER] Damn, that's good shit! Don't make a noise, they might get angry. I don't care! Hello... Hi, camera... Fuck that thesis! Hey! They look angry. They are leaving us here. Look, they are walking out. Look at the fire... Hello... Come here, babe! Let's fly! Want some tea? Let's drink it all. Come on! Come here! Let's fly. It feels good! - Let's go, babe! - Do you feel it? Do you feel the clouds? We're flying! How could you do this to me? How long have we been together? Get the fuck out of my place! What the fuck do you think you're doing! Get out! Get out now! I hate you! Get out! Get out now! Hail, Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Shame on you! What's happening? Excuse me, coming through. Check on the woman. Hey! What are these guys doing? Stop that already! Towels! Get some blankets and cover this one! Cover them. This one too! Shit! Give them water, wipe the blood off them. Check her pulse. - Check her pulse. - No more pulse, sir. Miss, give this one water, please! Douse them with water to calm down. - No more pulse, sir! - No more pulse? Make him calm down, okay? Splash some water on her. The other woman as well. - What happened? - They’ve been raging violently. Forgive us. My son. One of which is the island province of Mindoro, home to the indigenous peoples of the Banyan tribe. The Banyans were once the only inhabitants of Mindoro. Being coastal dwellers at first, they’ve moved inland and into the mountains-- to avoid the influx and influence of foreign settlers, such as the Tagalogs, the Spanish and their conquests and religious conversion and raids by the Moro. Today, the Banyans live secludedly in remote parts of Mindoro but eventually come down to the lowlands in order to make usual trades. Banyans live in peaceful societies. Banyans are usually treated as second class people in their own country, and they’re commonly subjected to abuse. Therefore, protection of their way of living and preservation of their heritage is essential in providing them with the same equal rights and addressing their problems and needs in this fast changing global environment that we currently live in. [APPLAUSE] Thank you! So that’s the documentary I did for the tribes of Banyan. For us to be able to connect with them again-- and to gain more knowledge about them... Just like any other films, no matter what the genre is.... Us— We as filmmakers are obliged to tell the truth... - ...no matter what. - Okay. Thank you! So... Any comments from our panelists? Yeah, Rene. I think the narrative is very clear. The fact that this tribe, they feel proud of their cultural heritage and they managed to preserve it up to this time. May I ask what is your theoretical framework? The muted group theory. Would you like to explain that? It’s the theory that gives voice like the tribes. - The abused women... - Please explain to me, because I don’t quite get why you chose a foreigner who, you know, probably doesn’t understand our language and culture to narrate a very Filipino topic that is the Banyan tribe. I’m not sure I agree with your decisions, please explain. I’m not seeing creative choices here. Can you just talk a bit about what… Are you planning something else… Is this basically… Is this it? Or are you still… Is it a work in progress? I mean it doesn’t look finished to me, honestly. How are you? How was the thesis defense? I did okay. How about you? I’m doing fine. So what’s your decision about us? I don’t know, Erik. I think it’s best for now that I go with my mom to the states. Goodbye. Hey! What’s up dude? Did you pass? Yeah, I passed. Are we going to celebrate or what? - I’m going to pass on that bro. - Again? You deserve a party for that. I’ll go next time, promise. - Alright. - Let's go. - Alright dude, see you around. - See you later! Erik look at this. It’s good. What are you watching? I don’t watch these kinds of film but it’s good. Mom... What If I return to med school? What do you think? It’s up to you, son. It’s your choice.
