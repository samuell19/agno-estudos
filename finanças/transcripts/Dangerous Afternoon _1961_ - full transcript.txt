with them randall one of the smartest jewel thieves in the business climb a wall like a cat and she got away but hinton didn't and got an extra sentence now we know where she went when she was released but three weeks ago she disappeared and there hasn't been a sign ever since then looks as though she was trying to blackmail this fellow burling or barrett and that he arranged to meet her

makes me feel so young that's what i'm afraid of goodbye darling i'll write you as soon as we get there and thank you for everything goodbye my dear and may you always be happy say goodbye to everyone darling be good jack keep her close to you always whatever happens i promise i will i know how you've loved and cared for her all these years i called in at the offices of the green funnel line the other day and asked to see a list of the passengers on the princess delphine when she went down the two names i was looking for weren't on the list i'll take care of them come on mr porsche to see you mr pawson but this time he says it's very important very well show him in of course good morning vicar this is nearly cool miss frost have you seen the paper not yet then you don't know no what about miss berry miss betty my dear vic what are you talking about sister thank you then you don't know that you've been harboring a criminal in this house criminal really vic listen to this miss rust it has been established that the woman whose body was found in the wrecked car after the collision near marshmallow last week did not die as a result of the accident but had been poisoned several hours before she has now been identified by her fingerprints as gene hinton who had been released from holloway prison six weeks ago after serving a sentence of several years well well the there's a photograph this hinton was in fact uh miss berry oh really baker i don't believe that there's a picture i see for yourself oh i admit it's like her but of course it's not the same woman i don't agree with you miss frost i think it is the same there are one two other points other surprising facts have come to light the owner of the car george burling of crofton farm west sultan butcher who was killed outright in the crash was in reality an ex-gang leader by the name of butch barrett and both he and the dead woman hinton had been associates of a notorious woman jewel thief by the name of randall who'd escaped from prison five years ago and was never caught the police think it is possible that after release gene hinton might have made contact with randall and anyone who recognizes his photograph and remembers seeing her within the last weeks is asked to communicate at once with the police really miss frost even if you don't believe miss berry was the woman i consider it your duty to inform the police my dear vicar i i really don't want to be bothered with this at all even if miss berry was gene hinton she's dead now and he couldn't do any good letting the police know she's been staying here it'll only cause a lot of unpleasantness but someone is about to tell them i mean she must have been seen about you no she never went out i'm sorry miss foster cause you any unpleasantness but if you refuse to inform the police i consider it my duty as vicar of this parish to do so myself why well they want to know where she spent the last weeks they think that she may have tried to make contact with ms frost why did she come here to this house was it to find to find emma randall you know i never said emma that was a slip a bad one you it was blackmail i suppose yes well what are you going to do nothing the next steps are up to you i shall not take them so far as i'm concerned i shall seal this with a seal of confession i realize of course that if nothing is said you may escape the judgment of men but there is another judgment miss frost that no one can escape i leave you to act as your conscience dictates goodbye yes? there's a lady asking to see you sir lady name of frost she's in a wheelchair she says it's important. all right show her in now the inspector will see you m'am morning madam what can i do for you? i have something to tell you inspector
