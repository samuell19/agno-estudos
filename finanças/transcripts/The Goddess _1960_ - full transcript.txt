Uncle Where's father? Look there! Uncle Look there! Hail, Goddess Durga! Take this. Write letters for the next 12 days, one each day. What if I don't have anything to write? Then write the same thing. And what if I forget? Then you won't be forgiven. Really? What will you do? You dare to forget first. What's happened? Why are you leaving? I have to attend college. I have an exam. I have to pass it. What's the use? Meaning... You're doing all this for a job and a job means daily wages. - Yes. - And daily wages means money. Yes. So are you falling short of money? So? When he was studying in England was Raja Ram Mohan Roy short of money? No. Do you know how intelligent your husband is? Do you know what the professors say about me? As if you can't be educated without learning English! Isn't your brother educated? Yes. He is. But it's the same old thing. There's an age of difference between me and my brother. Do you understand? You don't understand? You won't understand. No. Suppose I pass the exams and get an opportunity to go abroad. Then I'll have to go. Will you come with me? Why wouldn't I? I'll accompany you wherever you go. Tell me. What if father doesn't agree? He won't be able to live without me. Suppose I've convinced father. What then? How will Khokha stay here without me? He will. Will he be able to? As if there's only one small boy. Whatever it is. I won't be here to call out to you as "mother" any more. You've provided everything for me. You've helped me. You're the light of my path. I won't be here to call out to you as "mother" any more. I call out to you continually as mother. Mother! Are you still my mother? You've become my eyes, guiding me everywhere. I call out to you continually as mother. Mother! Are you still the mother? You've become my eyes. You've endowed me with knowledge. Mother, listen to the pleas of your son. Can a son survive if his mother dies? I won't be there to call you "mother" any more. You've provided everything for me. You've helped me. You're the light of my path. I won't be here to call to you as "mother" any more. I'll be going from house to house and beg for food. I won't be coming and taking shelter in your arms. I won't be here to call to you as "mother" any more. You've provided everything for me. You've helped me. You're the guiding light of my path. I won't be here to call to you as "mother" any more. Mother! Give me something. Mother! The burden I've given you are you unhappy about that, dear one? What else can you do, mother? This old son can't do much for you. Oh God! Should I be continually thinking of you? As if I had nothing else to do! No. Don't call out to me when I'm at work. Understand? Aunt you won't eat from my hands or do any of the other things. Close you eyes. Don't open them. Open your mouth. Wait a minute. Give it here. Who will you give it to? The postman. Give it to him. Come back straight away after that. Uncle postman... You don't have to sing any more. Go to sleep. Lie down properly. Only then I'll tell you stories, like every day. Now lie down properly. What story? It's a very good story. You'll like it very much. Stay there. I'll be back. Jairam! Mother, give me some rest. Give me some. Does mother appear before you just because you call her name? Can you tell me how many people have such a mother? Years ago when I wasn't able to walk without a stick if mother hadn't been there I wouldn't have been able to come back to this state. Do you know all the things I've done, dear one? I couldn't find peace of mind in this world so I thought that going to the pilgrimage place in Tarapore would be a good idea. But that wasn't to be. You came into this house. The house was illuminated. Then the yearning died down. In this old age when I've got a mother like you She of course is the Mother Goddess. She can make the impossible possible. What do you say? Do you know what worries me? I'm worried about your husband. Nowadays it isn't easy to cope with such a fast paced boy. You're the only one who can control him. He listens to whatever you say. Doesn't he? Does he write letters to you regularly? Or does he miss that out too? Does he? Does he write letters every day? What if I'd died of shock? How nice that would have been! Would it have been nice? Then where would you listen to stories from? Mother, who would put the dark powder around your eyes? Mother who would feed you? Mother. Then go and sleep with your mother. Why have you come here? Tell me a story. What story? What story? The demoness story. What demoness? There are lots of demonesses. The one that relishes the flesh of small children. There was a demoness. One day she... Mother Mother Mother Why didn't you tell me this all those days, mother? Father what are you doing? Prostrate before her, son. I was told in a dream, she's the manifestation of the goddess. O Mother Goddess, O Mother of the World bless me. Mother What's happening, mother? Mother's entered the trance of samadhi. Mother How are you? Whose house is this, sister? It's your house as of today. Why? Because God says so. It's good for you: a ground floor house. You don't have to climb any stairs. They'll worship you in the morning and the evening, as you're a manifestation. Where's Khokha? He must be somewhere. He hasn't come here. He's terrified of father-in-law's carrying on. I'm leaving. It's time for evening prayers. OK? Sister What? Will you write a letter to him? I will. Don't worry. I've made a mistake, Mother. I've made a mistake. Forgive me for my mistake. Forgive me for my sin. Dear brother-in-law I'm bringing up your wife for an important reason. I'm not writing much in this letter. You'll be told everything when you come. So early in the morning? Have you got everything ready for the priest? If the daughter-in-law is a manifestation then why can't I be the boatman? Where to? Oh God! Today everyone's slept in. Why is everyone sleeping so soundly? Blow the conch and make the ooluk sound. What's going on? Don't you feel ashamed? You're my wife. An old man babbles something and you listen to him! Can't you think for yourself? Aren't I supposed to listen to my father? What's the good of listening to him? Tell me that. Is it harming you? Is it harming me? Khokha's here, and besides... What an act! An manifestation, eh! I can't stand this drama any longer. You're feeling slighted by that? Here you are: I'll bow before you. What do you want me to do? Everything belongs to father: the property his deeds his land and his money. What do I have? I have a wife but she doesn't let me near her. Should I? You're always soaked in alcohol. Soaked in alcohol? It's not the alcohol, dear one. That's an excuse. Get up. The alcohol's just an excuse. - What's your name? - Gayen Ghosh. What Ghosh? Dayaram Ghosh? Dayaram Ghosh or Gayen Ghosh? Gayen Ghosh. How cunning! You're cunning. Your father's cunning. Your father's father's cunning. Your whole lineage is cunning. Your whole clan's cunning. What are you sniggering at? He's abusing my whole community. Hey, you. How dare you abuse me? Don't get angry. Ask me for proof. If I can't give you any, hit me with a slipper, on the head. Hit my father with a slipper on his head. Hit my whole clan with a slipper on their heads. This isn't just pre-exam training. An exam... That'd just be a formality. In the end they'd inevitably fail. So instead of failing without the exam, they'd just be failing after it. You're so concerned about your exam, it's as if... Then tell me what the matter is. What can be your problem, brother? You're so fortunate! You've completed your B.A. You'll get a job. It doesn't matter even if you don't get one. You have ancestral wealth. You're the one who has so much of that. - Where do I have that? - Don't you? - I mean, there won't be any. - Won't there? Father will have it. I won't. What do you mean? Total disinheritance: He's disowned me. Is it something to do with a girl? - What girl? - Isn't there one? She's a widow. What's so great about her? Uma, if you saw her... Are you kidding? Is this something you've known about me all this time? OK. See you later. Are you trying to get rid of me? Listen. Have you heard me debate? Will you debate with my father? I'll try and convince him. I have all the arguments about the widow. You just usher me in. Who to? Father? Both of them. Won't I get to meet the one I'm fighting for? - OK - OK? - Yes. All right. - Hasn't any other letter come? - No, sir. - Just this one? - Yes, just this one. When do you wake up in the morning? I don't know the exact time, sir. When they wash the roads, the noise wakes me up. When you wake up tomorrow, wake me too. I have to get up and study. Mother Mother, I've come to you. If you have any pity in your heart, if you have any powers cure my sick grandson. What's happened with him? He's been sick for the past 8 days. I've done whatever I could. This morning, his body gave in. That's why I thought I should visit her at once. She's a manifestation. All Merciful One! If she wishes, everything's possible. Come on, Nivaran. Since last night he hasn't opened his eyes, even once. He's been lying like this. Everything's possible for you, mother. I have no one but him. Show some mercy. Don't worry. There's no medicine greater than the Mother's blessing. Open your eyes, dear one. I'd be left all alone without you. Open your eyes, dear one. I'll sing your praises all my life, Mother. Cure him. Cure him, Mother. Father When did you come, dear one? - Do you know, dear one? - What's all this about, father? All my years of penance have borne fruit, dear one. The all-powerful Mother has come to our house in the guise of the daughter-in-law. What do you mean? What do I mean? Can't you understand? The merciful Mother is your wife. She's the manifestation of the Goddess. The Goddess! - You've gone mad. - What did you say? You've gone mad, father. I've gone mad? Definitely. You've lost your mind. How did you imagine such an extraordinary thing? Really. No. Have I lost my mind? Am I mad? No! Will you listen? Will you listen to something? When I was your age it was written then: Listen about Raguvansha. Want to hear more? Father, how did you find out she was a manifestation of the Goddess? What evidence did you find? Evidence? Has a dream ever been evidence? A dream? You had a dream? Is all this the result of your dream? You're scoffing? I've been worshipping her, the past 48 years. I worship the Goddess with such diligence I haven't missed celebrating any of her festivals. You know all this. It's not that you don't know this. Even then you're laughing! Whatever you may say, father, I don't believe you. Am I lying? You may have dreamt it. Since you're saying so, you surely must have dreamt about it. But Dayamayi's the Goddess. I can't believe this. You don't believe in manifestations. Is that what mean? Father the last 3 years, you're not the only one who's known her. I've known her, too. I know that she's human. I won't let this ritual take place. Mother! Father, let me go. It won't help for you to stop me. I won't let this ritual Mother, have mercy. Mother! Do you want more evidence? A dead boy has come to life. Is that possible if Dayamayi isn't the Goddess herself? Uma, go and prostrate before her. Hail the All Merciful Mother! O Merciful Mother! What's happening, sister-in-law? How do I know, brother-in-law? I've never seen such a thing before. I can't understand anything. I hope you're able to see reason. What does brother say? Father started calling her Mother and fell at her feet and he did the same. What else could he do? He fell at her feet? Watch the drama of the ritual this evening. Uncle do you believe it? Tell me, Daya. Do you believe it? Do you believe you're not human, but the Goddess? That you're a manifestation? Listen, Daya. You don't have to tell me anything. I know you're exhausted. Just nod your head once and say no. Do you believe in whatever it is that's happening? And that what father's saying is the truth? Just say no, once, Daya. I don't need anything more. You're afraid, aren't you? I know you're afraid but I don't believe this. I know you don't either. You're just a child. That's why you can't say anything but I can't leave you like this. We'll get away, Daya. We'll leave right now, for Kolkata. I've made all the arrangements. There won't be any problem. The boat's waiting. You just have to go by the riverside road, won't you? Come on, Daya. What's happening? Come on, Daya. We'll be too late. What if I am the Goddess? What if I am the Goddess? Have you gone mad too, Daya? That boy was healed. He opened his eyes. So what? So many people recover that way. This isn't right. What if.. If you'd been a Goddess, wouldn't you have known it by yourself? Can you feel any change in yourself? Don't you feel you're human? Aren't you my wife? Suppose us running away like this harms you somehow. Listen, Daya. You're my wife. I'm your husband. That isn't false. We've been married according to tradition. Have you forgotten everything these 3 years, Daya? I won't be able to live without you, Daya. Don't you love me? Don't you love me? Listen, Daya. If you weaken now, you'll be sorry later. I won't be with you then. Come on, Daya. If we leave here all your worries will be gone. Come on, Daya. No! Don't ask me to come. I'm feeling scared. Don't ask me to come. I'm feeling scared. Don't cry, Daya. Look at me. Don't cry. Come on. Come on. I'll take you back. This time I've recognized you, Mother. You're on my lips, O Kali. You're in my heart, Kali. You're at the core of my soul, Mother Kali. The one who's the essence of life I believe in Her with all my heart. I know in my heart, in my soul your grace, O Mother in a new form, a new manifestation. Come and see mother Shyama the personification of mercy, the river of love the personification of mercy, the river of love. There are no bounds to the joy. This time I've recognized you, Mother. You're on my lips, O Kali. You're in my heart, Kali. You're at the core of my soul, Mother Kali. Are you made of clay? Are you made of clay? Then why don't you talk? You idol! - Daya - What's happening? Look at this, this button. Mother Isn't believing a big issue for you? As far as I can understand you and your wife are facing a controversy. Whatever the reason is you've been denied the general rights of a husband. Isn't that your actual tragedy? - I was thinking about myself. - Let me do the thinking. 317: Does she believe in this? No. Then why isn't she resisting? How can she? Everything's been forced on her and he isn't giving any reason for his actions. But you... what are you doing? The thing you're so boldly declaring to be false Don't you have the courage to contradict it and discredit it? As a young man, at the age of 19 I changed my religion. You didn't know my father. If you'd known him, you'd understand that it wasn't easy to do. He wasn't a superstitious person but my thinking didn't match his ways. Doing something against tradition means getting injured. That's the rule. It has to happen. But I wouldn't have found peace if I hadn't been injured. Your mind, your wisdom, your conscience if these can't accept something as the truth then that... You have to make a decision. You alone have to make the decision. That's your test. Come on. Dear one - I have a question. - Ask me. Does master know you've sent for me? Dear one, if I tell him once "My son is sick. Take care of him," what's wrong with that? You've done that before too. Dear one, before and now... Now, it's the all-powerful Mother herself. Your offering has cured me of a dreaded disease, dear one. If I come there and arrange for medicines Dear one, if I ask him What happened, dear one? What happened? Since this afternoon, not even a drop of water... I'll attend to him, dear one. Our medicines aren't fake, dear one. We're doctors too. But I'd like to tell you something, dear one. If possible take him to her once, dear one. There isn't anything wrong in consuming the mother's offering. This too has happened from that, and that too. Since when? Does father know? - He should know. - Why? What do you mean? Why? I'll leave. You won't go from here. You don't believe even now? Leave me! Son Aunt Mother Give Khokha to her. Khokha's ill, Mother. Believing in your mercy, I've brought him to you. You know everything, Mother. There's nothing you can't do. Have mercy and heal him, Mother. Taraprasad, you can go. Go and arrange for the blessing substances to be fed to Khokha. I'm leaving him with you, Mother. Will you be able to cure him? Promise me, dear one. Are you human or divine? Tell me, dear one. This is about life and death. You have to answer. Will you take him away? I don't believe in you. What can I do? I'm not able to believe it. I wouldn't have let them bring him to you but even in his fever, he's been calling out to you not once, but again and again, "Aunt, Aunt". I don't know what's true and what's false but will you be able to heal him? If you don't return him to me, I can't snatch him away from you. Will you be able to? Let him be with me tonight. Will you return him tomorrow? Don't cry. You're supposed to be divine. Don't cry. Mother Tara! Brahma Mahima! What's happened, Mother? Father What's happened? He's gone. Mother took him away. My grandson's gone away. Khokha The one who cured so many diseases I had handed him over to her but she didn't return him. What wrong had I done, Mother? What are you punishing me for, Mother? What are you punishing me for? A mistake? Your chants Your wisdom, your thoughts You've killed Khokha, father. You've killed Khokha. Did you get him treated by a doctor? I handed him over to the Mother, herself. At her mercy, at her holy feet. You're the one who's killed him. You're superstition is the cause. What do you mean, Uma? What are you saying? Do you want to hear about your mistakes? By attributing a divine nature to my wife you've crushed her heart. Don't say such things, dear one. I don't know what you've got from it but her life is in ruins. Today I'll save her. Uma Demoness! The demoness ate my son. Daya You? Have you come? Daya Put this on me. Dear one, put this on me. Come on. Hurry up. I have to go. Put it on. Where do you have to go, Daya? I have to go away or else they'll kill me. Khokha was... Daya Come on! - Come quick! - Where!
