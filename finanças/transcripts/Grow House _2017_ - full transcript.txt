CHRIS: Oh no, no. Hold on. We're not finished yet. Somebody still has to go up and connect the cables and then we're done. What? Why the hell you just didn't connect it while you was up there? DARIUS: I don't get why we have to steal power. It ain't like we gotta pay for the bill to begin with. So the power company doesn't see a huge spike in usage. And they tell the owners. And the owners tell police. Yeah, that ain't good. I can't have my girlfriend getting fired. Fired? That happen we going to jail, bro. Why didn't you just connect them while you was up there? Oh, no, no, no. It's your grow, it's your show. I don't execute the connection. I just wire it up. PAT: Is it dangerous? CHRIS: It's not dangerous. I mean the power's off so you're totally good. It's just policy. And also stealing power is totally illegal. So what do we have to do? Somebody's gonna climb up this ladder... Mhmm. ...and then you're gonna connect the red clamp to the cable with the black tape and then you're gonna connect the black clamp to the cable with the white tape. Got it, got it. CHRIS: And then we'll turn the power back on and we're ready to get growin'. Let's do this thing. Darius, give me that flashlight, bro. Alright, I'mma hold it steady while you climb up there. I thought you said you was in charge of electricity. I am but I'm scared of heights, man. Come on. Knock it out. Get up there. Look at ya. Like a little monkey. What'd you say? Put the red clamp on the black cable, and the black clamp on the white cable. Alright. - [sizzling] - [screams] Oh! Oh! Move back! CHRIS: You okay? PAT [echoing]: Shit! D? D? Man, D. Don't do this to me, homie. More like we did this to him. You know CPR? I know THC. [knocking] Hope that's not the police. Do something... like pump his chest or something. Get that mothafucka up. [knocking continues] Hi, um... I heard a loud noise and then I saw a big light flash coming from this direction so I thought this would be... Here? Yeah here... the perfect time to come introduce myself. Hi, I'm Madison. Hey. Pat. Nice to meet you. Are you okay? I'm fine. I'm great. Is everything okay? Yeah! Your friend. You sure? Yeah, positive. Well what... is your friend okay? Oh yeah. They in love. They been arguing all day, he just laid down on the ground. He was like, "I don't wanna talk to you." Are you okay? You seem a little nervous. 'Cause you came over here all late and I get scared. Okay. Nice meetin' you! Another time, promise. I'll talk to you in, like, the daytime. I'm a daytime person. Okay. He's gone, man. He gone? Gone where? It's unbelievable, man. He's definitely dead. What? Amazing. Amazing? Why when something tragic happen white people try and make it sound cool? It's not amazing that my friend is dead! No, I mean it can be tragic and amazing. This... It's... I get it. I know what you're going through, man. I mean, this is the third one. What'd you say? Two... Two other guys died the same way. Like this? Mhmm. You said it was safe! You said it was safe! We don't have time for this, man! I mean, he's gonna start decomposing soon. Decomposing? Yeah, he's gonna start rotting... smell up our grow house. Our grow house? Ain't no more damn grow house. Alright? My friend's laying here dead. Now shut up and let me think. Look man. Thinking isn't gonna bring him back to life, okay. We gotta... Look, his little hands are all balled up. It's rigormortis. No they were always balled up like that. We gotta bury him. Don't you touch him! Don't touch him! We have... Don't you touch him. We're not burying him. Okay, we'll take it slow. Let's uh... I'm gonna say a little prayer. For Darius. A fallen comrade who died too young, too short, small in stature but... big in spirit. A great man. A man who... whose heart was much bigger than his body. He stood for the betterment of pot for all. This goes to you, buddy. Wherever you are. Oh my... God? God? Is that God? God? What is it? Yes, my son? Oh, Darius. My son. Am I dead? So that means I'm dead. I'm dead? Now thou shall have known it was janky when thou seeneth them jumper cables. What the hell was you thinkin', boy? So is that a yes? 'Cause you confused me. Not exactly. I'm thinking about it though. I mean, you got potential but, you gotta stop labor trickin' and go out there and pursue your dreams, my son. You know about that too? I know about everything. Even things that no one else knows about. Like your big grown ass having a gangsta mix tape. You know, you too old for that, boy. So you saying I should pursue my music career? Hell no! There's too many people out there downloading music illegally anyway. And I know who all y'all are. I'mma deal with you later. Believe that. CHRIS: Pat. - Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat... - What? - Look. - Darius! Darius! What happened? I smoked, then I blew it out, and then he started coming back to life. So blow some more smoke! But I do like what you're doin' on the front lines of this cannabis battle. I put weed here for you to enjoy. And for those who need it. Keep fightin' the good fight. Now go back, my son. PAT: Darius! D, get up! I smell weed. That's this weed. Yeah! I brought him back to life! You back, man! You back! Aw shit! We're back in business. Is that all that matters to you? Business? Yeah.Yeah. Okay. I'm just glad you're okay, man. You're my friend. Oh man! D! Rabbit's foot did it again. You gonna believe. I guess it did, man. - It did. - I really think it was the weed. - So did it work? - The rabbit's foot? No. The electricity. I forgot to tell you that after you hit that main switch off, there's a little bit of zip left in the lines. I went ahead and connected those wires so that that doesn't happen again. Thank you now. Yeah, no problem. So I guess we back on track. Don't do that. You sure you good? A little. Alright that's good, man. Okay. Step five: Electricity, lights, and fan installations. Done. Step six: Feeding systems, reservoirs, and tubing connected. Done. All we gotta do now is we gotta set up the filters, then we gotta pick up the plants and bring 'em in. When you guys come here in the morning we should be all up and running. Alright. Lemme hit that blunt. I think I need that right now. My friend was just dead and now he's back. Y'know, life is good! I wouldn't be mad if I saw another jumper cable ever again in my life. Shit! You didn't crank that shit up, did you? No, not yet. Is it working? If I... wait till I say crank it up. Now? Hold on! Ain't feelin' to get electrocuted again. Alright try it now. [engine starts] Yes! Thank you, baby! Finally! Can I do it? Yes. Can I do it? Stop it. Alright I'm about to head over to the Bel-Air house and get started on this work. Okay listen, I got all that stuff that you checked off on the list but my boss wants to know like what's the estimated time you think that the house is gonna be ready? Well we just finished doing the general cleanup and shit, so... I guess once the sink come in we can get started with everything else. But that's gonna take about ten weeks. Ten weeks? Baby that's a long time! Shit gotta get shipped in, and mailed in, that take about... That's six weeks in itself. God. Alright well I'll let him know.[phone buzzes] It should be done in mid-April though. I am so happy you fixed the van for me, baby. What you gonna do for it though? Oh God.

Bad news, I had to cut that nigga in on a deal. Good news is, you and Reg, that shit squashed. Hold up, so you let him roll on us? You let him roll over on you. He rolled you left, he rolled you right. That man is strong from the waist up, man. You don't know. He was strong from the hips up. He fucking your girl, man. Whatever, man. She'll fuck anything. I don't even fuck with her ragged ass. No way. Anyway, I promised to get him three pounds as a wedding gift. Wedding gift? What the fuck? They getting married? Got your ass. You care! No, I don't care. Look at your caring ass, all concerned. I wish them the best, I mean, if that's what he want. Hey, you never know. You care. Well showing how much we're growing so I said three pounds. Ain't like Reg can go upstairs and check. We ain't getting no ramp up in this mothafucka so you go take more of our weed, mothafucka. You a vulture, bro. I don't care, I mean I wish them the best. [sniffing] You smell something? [smoke alarm blaring]Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Oh shit! Oh shit! Get something! Get something!

DARIUS: Just tell them we got everything under control, man! PAT: I can't do that shit. They gotta come in. They gotta check it. - It's they policy! - Well that can't happen. Oh man, they gonna come in, they gonna see what we've been doing. They gonna call the fucking police, man. Then you going to jail! I ain't going to jail, I'm snitching on you. Damn! Is there a fire? Please tell me my BBC wolf is okay! Everything is good. Everything is good. Bring the hose. Hose? No, no! No need for a hose! Right there. Okay. So how'd the trashcan catch fire? [sniffing] Is that the smell of a leafy substance resembling that of marijuana? You have a great nose. And also amazing eyes. Well what happened was... we're legal. This is a marijuana card. Why I got this is because of uh... A lack of appetite! Lack of appetite. And what happened was I was smoking and when I put my weed out I forgot to put it all the way out. It started a fire. FIREMAN: Well you can never be too sure those things are fully out. Next time break it down into smaller pieces before you roll it. - Will do. - Mhmm. [mouthing] We're all good here. He smoke... He is dreamy. You're amazing! How did you think... You thought of this? How did you do that, man? Double lucky blessings. Don't you start with that again, man. I don't care how you came up with it. It's brilliant. Alright? Now look. What's up? Matt said he gonna send somebody here tomorrow to check out them damn filters. I just hope the weed last overnight. Ah! Did you just say, "I hope the weed lasts overnight"? DARIUS: Nah, your hearing aid's messing up. I said I hope we last overnight. Did you also say... that someone was coming to fix the filters? Heat filters. Heat filters. Oh no. Oh no. And all those lights that you hauled off of the hydro truck. Maybe I think I should just call Henry's people. And maybe I'm gonna call the cops and I'm just gonna tell them that they should walk around... Oh come on, man! I am disappointed! - What? - You would lie to me, BBC? Who's BBC? That's me. BBC? A big black... Wolf.Wolf. Mmm! You know, I did not get to be this old by being dumb. I think it is time we... cut the crap! And we just get down to business! Business? Bid-ness! See, I tried to tell you. See I can act as if... I don't know anything's going on. I think you know where this is going. Oh, okay. I get it. What is it going to take for you not to know anything? You. - What? - You. Wait, wait, listen. Listen to me. Listen to me. Look up. We have a lot of money. We have a lot of weed. I don't need your money. I got a lot of money. And I don't smoke weed. I drink. I need a hit of that. Deal! Deal? We'll take it. My house. Your house? We'll be at my house. Yeah, BBC. Go and handle that. What the fuck? So I save your ass and you give my ass away? What type of shit... Handle that. [woman squealing happily] MAN: So I just set the ventilation system back on. You guys feel better now? Oh yeah. I feel much better. As a matter of fact, I'm a little cold but I like it. How you feel, D? Like a rape victim. Like somebody took something from a nigga. You feel like a pimp now? Do I owe you some money? If I had to I would take one for the team too. Nigga, I took one for the whole league! Oh man. I'm so glad you guys made it. I thought you were goners. I got out just in time to see your old lady pull up. Bro, you don't wanna know what happened. Trust me. He ain't gonna tell you. You guys, if I could give you a sitrep? Give us what? A sitrep. A situation report. You know. A status of operation. Aw shit. Don't you come with this conspiracy shit like this nigga. What do you mean? The bad news is that you guys did lose the one room to the fire. But the good news is that I checked up on all the other six rooms and they're all according to plan. Yeah well now we just need to clip some of these big water leaves 'cause they're blocking direct light. Well let's go ahead and get started on this room.

It's kinda dead around here and I figure we liven it up. As much as I appreciate the free entertainment, it's amazing, I'm really proud of you guys, but the property value is going down as we speak. So, could you guys just keep it down a little bit? I really would appreciate that. Thank you. Mrs. Gilliam! Mrs Gilliam! Oh my God. Man, I just don't get how the hell I get out there in the middle of the driveway like that. And what the hell I'm doing with this Shake Weight? That weed worked for you, man. I mean, if that's what all rap music is like I'm a rap fan. Look, do not encourage his ass. I think I can get into it. You felt it? Was it that good? What you was doing with the Shake Weight is bugging the fuck out. You jeopardized this whole grow, man. Do not bring unwanted attention to your grow house. And that shit was unwanted. You're right. I'm sorry. My fault. I mean, first things first. We have to finish this harvest, guys. Then we can give everybody they cut. Can't wait to do that. Hey look at the bright side. At least we had a successful grow. No. Sort of. If you wanna call it that. Hey, why Snoop ain't called me yet? Guys, we still have stuff left to do here, so... Speaking of Snoop... hit him up, and hit your girl... ...ex-girl... Right. and let 'em know everything be ready for the payout on the 20th. This damn house will be done by then too. ♪ Hey, what time is everybody supposed to show up? Well I told everybody around 4:00. That way they have they weed around 4:20. Oh that's trippy. I like it. It's a good idea we didn't dry that weed all the way. The more it weigh, the less we pay. Think about all the weed we lost, man. The fire. The mold. The flood! The Bugged Out. Most of all, all the unexpected partners we acquired. Matter of fact I had to pay Mrs. Gilliam off. That should account for everything. She's kinda sexy for her age. Is she flexible? Depends. Depends on what? No it depends on if she's wearing Depends 'cause when she ain't... What does that have... Listen! Whatever happened, happened, man. We lose, we lose. Ain't no going back on it, man. I don't know about that. Why don't we try to call Snoop back up? Try to re-un-negotiate the deal? Re-un-negotiate? You know what, he was cool as hell about this whole thing. He ain't called us one time. Give it a try! Yeah, let me hit him up. You know, what he gonna say? Tell him we took a... Hello? Oh, it's voicemail. ...paper right now. But if this is about my paper, leave me a message and I'll get back at you. Yeah, um... Let's just talk to him man-to-man. What about Matt's piece? I mean, we gotta get paid. Come on, man! Of course we gonna take care of you, bro. You're a real nigga. I fucked with you my nigga. I don't know what that means but I really enjoyed this experience. It was good working with you people. You people? The fuck you mean by "You people," bro? Huh? I just meant like you people, like my people. You're my people... not my people. What the fuck you mean by "Your people," man? I don't mean like I own... What the fuck you mean "You own"? No I just meant we're all people.[doorbell rings] What you mean, man? Huh? I really don't care. I'm mixed. I'm gonna get the doorbell. I'm not mixed, bro. I didn't mean anything. What you mean about you ain't mean anything? That's exactly what it sounds like. What the fuck you mean "exactly" though? I'm sorry. PAT: What the fuck you mean by you sorry, bro? It means I apologize. I'll get the weed. Here it is. Thank you, brotha. A'ight. Everybody gonna get they share as soon as Snoop gets here. Yeah, that's the plan, we sticking to it. Listen, if you really think Snoop is about to come here to pick up some weed, you'sa lame. [doorbell rings] What's that? I'll get the door. Wonder who that could be. See? Shut the fuck up, boo. Well happy 4-20 everybody. What's up, Snoop. Hey, what's up, Nephew. - Snoop! - Grown Gangsta. Hi, Snoop. Well hello, sunshine. Snoop? Mhmm? Can me and Darius holla at you in the kitchen right quick? Oh man, whatever you like, man. Show me where to get there. "Hi, Snoop." What? Snoop's supposed to walk in, I'm supposed to act like I don't know who Snoop is? Bitch, this ain't Walmart. He don't need no greeter. Want something to drink, man? Turkey sandwich? You said we had some tuna... We have some tuna left. Want some tuna? No, no, no. I just want my shit. Where my weed at? Oh. So we getting right down to it. Um, Snoop... ...we agreed on half, right? Yeah. That's what I'm leaving with. Half, right? TERRI: Okay but that's Snoop Dogg. I'm just supposed to say nothing? You supposed to play your position. Why are you always tripping? Bitch, I can't trip. I know we agreed on half, but things ain't go how we thought they'd go. We was talking 'bout half and third, I'm thinkin' more like the third, y'know. Grown Gangsta. I'm mothafuckin' disappointed with you, nigga. Nah, nah. What he said he was just thinking about the third, Snoop. Y'know, man. But he gonna keep it one hundred. 'Cause Grown Gangsta say you always keep it one hundred with him, man. Day one. We really just wanted to show you the kitchen, man. Yeah, you ain't even know this was a refrigerator. See? We got you. Okay well then get back to the living room. PAT: Alright, Chris. Let's break it up. Snoop, the take was twenty pounds. That entitles you to ten, bro. Oh man. It is so beautiful doing business with y'all, man. It's a treat when playas meet. Grown Gangsta, that mix-tape, I'm fuckin' with you but you better thank this nigga Pat, man. He really got your back, man. He give a fuck about you. Yeah. I'm outta here. Let's roll. Bye Snoop! Alright baby. PAT: Chris. Seven pounds over there for you, brother. Oh, for real? Wait, nuh-uh. For real nothing. Seven pounds from where? Yeah wait. Hold up. How'd you come up with that? That ain't adding up, homeboy. Okay, all the equipment, the setup, him dealing with the grow house day to day, that's seven pounds right there, homie. Appreciate you. It's been fun, man. If we do this again maybe you guys will end up with something, y'know? Ha! So... what about ours? Terri and Reg. Mhmm. Three pounds. DARIUS: Not a seed more. I hope you got your shit outta here because I'm about to lock it up. Give me the keys. Listen, while you working on the house, go on ahead and throw in some ratchet locks. And work on your feet. And his toenails. Then on his fingers. Goodbye. Damn. Whoo! Damn. I feel like Lebron right before he won the big one, man. We was so close! Look at this. Says right here, "In the end, the happiest day of your grow is after step ten." Do I look happy? What the hell is you smiling 'bout? All that shit we been through and all you got to show for it is that one damn blunt. Not exactly. What? We still got two pounds we didn't know we had. How's that? We weighed it all out. We still had that Bugged Out in the garage. I ain't smokin' that. I ain't either. Huh? Oh! You switched... You happy now, ain't you? Hell yeah I'm happy! I know you is. You a smart mothafucka, man! Hey, man, I learned from the best, bro. We learned from each other, bro. My man. Let me hit that. Let me hit that. Nope. Let me hit that. Wow, you guys look happy. Actually it's our last day disturbing your neighborhood. We moving out. Mhmm. So the crop must be done. Don't think that because I don't get out the house much that I don't know what you guys have going on over here. Uh-huh. I smoke too sometimes. Are you kidding me? I had no idea. - [door opens] - DARIUS: Uh-oh. Where we goin? Wanna hit it? [chuckles] So, question. What we gonna call it? I got the perfect name. PAT: What? Abracadabra. - Oh my god. - Abracadabra? Abracadabra. I like it though. It's like magic, huh? I like it too. It has a little ring to it. Because we ain't have no weed and you made some appear out of no-damn-where. Happy 4-20! Happy 4-20, bro. Happy 4-20.Hell yeah. Hold up. Who's that? Mrs. Gilliam, man. Shit, she's sayin'... BBC? "Hey, don't forget about me." - [phone buzzes] - Is that a picture? MADISON: What is BBC? Oh!
