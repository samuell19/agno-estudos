The war to end all wars did not end soon enough. So, Heartland, U.S.A. sent the allies... its most effective secret weapon. Sergeant Pepper... and his Lonely Hearts Club Band. For music above and beyond the call of duty... Sergeant Pepper was awarded the coveted Golden Eagle. Heartland was proud of its famous sergeant. But more than that, they delighted in knowing that he remained... a good, simple, small-town boy. Every time Sergeant Pepper played, the world danced. They danced through the Roaring Twenties, the Depression, economic recovery... and yet... another great war. And for some 50-odd years, Heartland's feet tapped to the beat... of Sergeant Pepper's magical music. How do you honor someone who had done so much... to make so many people so happy? Heartland decided to erect a Sergeant Pepper weather vane... on top of our city hall. It would always point the way to happiness. And as mayor, I presided over the ceremony. At the end, Sergeant Pepper assured us that he would play us one more tune. Oh, well. August 10, 1958. A day none of us will ever forget. To the town of Heartland, he left his musical instruments. These instruments have the power to make dreams come true. And as long as they remained in Heartland's care, humanity would live happily forever after. Sergeant Pepper left his wholesome grandson, Billy Shears, his cherished Golden Eagle. This made Billy's stepbrother, the greedy Dougie Shears, veryjealous indeed. Sergeant Pepper then asked Billy to form a new Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. This band would feature Billy's three best friends. Mark, Dave and Bob Henderson. We wondered if there would ever be a new Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. And we wondered what the new band would sound like. Dougie appointed himself their business manager... and introduced the band in his own unique way. It was 20 years ago today Sergeant Pepper taught the band to play They've been going in and out of style But they're guaranteed to raise a smile So may I introduce to you The act you've known for all these years Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band We're Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band We hope you will enjoy the show Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band Sit back and let the evening go Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band It's wonderful to be here It's certainly a thrill You're such a lovely audience We'd like to take you home with us We'd love to take you home I don't really want to stop the show But I thought you might like to know That the singer's gonna sing a song And he wants you all to sing along So let me introduce to you The one and only Billy Shears Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band Billy Shears What would you think if I sang out of tune Would you stand up and walk out on me Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song And I'll try not to sing out of key I get by with a little help from my friends Mmm, I get high with a little help from my friends Yeah, gonna try with a little help from my friends What do I do when my love is away Does it worry you to be alone How do I feel by the end of the day Are you sad because you're on your own No, I get by with a little help from my friends Yeah, I get high with a little help from my friends Gonna try with a little help from my friends Do you need anybody I need somebody to love Could it be anybody I just want somebody to love Would you believe in a love at first sight Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time What do you see when you turn out the light I can't tell you but I know it's mine Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends Yeah, I get high with a little help from my friends Oooh, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends I get high with a little help from my friends With a little help from my friends Heartland loved the boys, and the boys loved music. Billy and Strawberry loved each other. And Dougie loved making money. But on that memorable day a telegram arrived... that was destined to change their lives. It came from B.D. Hoffler, the president of Big Deal Records, the world's largest, most successful record company. ''We hear your music is great. Stop. ''We need a tape of your songs, and we need it now. Stop. ''If we like your music, we'll make you superstars and the money will never stop. Stop. Signed, B.D. Hoffler, Hollywood. '' A long, long way from Heartland. How about that? Superstars from Heartland. Who could be more deserving? Wouldn't Sergeant Pepper be proud? Just think. Superstars. Who could be more deserving? Hmm. I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in And stops my mind from wandering Where it will go I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door That kept my mind from wandering Where it will go And it really doesn't matter If I'm wrong I'm right Where I belong I'm right Where I belong See the people standing there who disagree and never win And wonder why they don't get in my door I'm painting my room in a colorful way And when my mind is wandering There I will go La, la, la, la, la I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in And stops my mind from wandering - Where - Where - It - It - Will - Will - Go - Go Oh, one and a two One, two, three Da-da, bah, bah Bah, bah, bah, bah Bah, bah bah, bah, bah-bah Dee-dee, dee-doo, dee-doo dee-diddledy diddledy diddledy And one Two One, two One, two, three, four It's getting better all the time - Used to get mad at my school - But I can't complain The teachers that taught me weren't cool No, I can't complain You're holding me down It's getting better all the time - I used to get mad at my school - But I can't complain The teachers that taught me weren't cool No, I can't complain You're holding me down You're turning me round Ahhh Filling me up with your rules I got to admit it's getting better Better A little better all the time Can't get no worse I have to admit it's getting better Better It's getting better Since you've been mine Me used to be angry young man Me hiding me head in the sand Keep your mind on business. - Take over Heartland. - I've got to admit it's getting better - Better - A little better all the time It can't get no worse I have to admit It's getting better Why?

The telegram read, ''B.D. loves your music. B.D. loves you. Expect you in Hollywood tomorrow. Signed, B.D. '' Everybody was happy. But Strawberry realized that she and Billy would be separated... for the first time in their young lives. There was barely time for tender farewells.

Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Look. Strawberry is leaving. Picture yourself in a boat on a river With tangerine trees and marmalade skies Somebody calls you You answer quite slowly A girl with kaleidoscope eyes Cellophane flowers of yellow and green Towering over your head Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes And she's gone Lucy in the sky with diamonds Lucy in the sky with diamonds Lucy in the sky with diamonds Ahhh Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain Where rocking horse people Eat marshmallow pies Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers That grow so incredibly high Newspaper taxis appear on the shore Waiting to take you away Climb in the back with your head in the clouds And you're gone Lucy in the sky with diamonds Lucy in the sky with diamonds Lucy in the sky with diamonds Ahhh Picture yourself on a train in a station With plasticine porters With looking glass ties Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile The girl with kaleidoscope eyes Lucy in the sky with diamonds Talkin' about Lucy Lucy in the sky with diamonds Talkin' about Lucy Lucy in the sky with diamonds Ahhh Lucy in the sky with diamonds Talkin' about Lucy Lucy in the sky with diamonds Ohhh, Lucy Lucy in the sky with diamonds Talkin' about Lucy Lucy in the sky with diamonds Ohhh, Lucy Lucy in the sky with diamonds Oh, darling Please believe me I'll never do you no harm Believe me when I tell you I'll never do you no harm Oh, darling If you leave me I'll I'll never make it alone So believe me when I beg you Don't you ever leave me alone Leave me alone When you told me You didn't need me anymore Well,you know I nearly broke down and cried When you told me You didn't need me anymore Well, you know I nearly broke down and died Oh, darling If you leave me I'll never make it alone So believe me when I tell you I'll never do you no harm When you told me You didn't need me anymore Well, you know You know I nearly broke down And cried When you told me You didn't need me anymore Well, you know You know I nearly broke down And died Oh, darling Please believe me Well, while Mustard roamed through the building looking for Strawberry, she and her Heartland friends dashed to the van and captured it. Now, the question is could the boys discover... how to use this computerized link to F. V.B.... to help recover the lost instruments. Turn on the big screen. Take the cornet to Dr. Maxwell. Dr. Maxwell, a small-time quack who became a big-time specialist... turning ugly, old corrupt people into handsome,young corrupt people. Joan was quizzical Studied pataphysical Science in the home Late nights all alone with a test tube Oh, oh, oh, oh Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine Calls her on the phone Can I take you out to the pictures Jo-o-o-oan But as she's getting ready to go A knock comes on the door Bang, bang Maxwell's silver hammer Came down upon her head Bang, bang Maxwell's silver hammer Made sure that she was dead Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again Teacher gets annoyed Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away So he waits behind Writing 50 times I must not be so-o-o-o But when she turns her back on the boy He creeps up from behind Bang, bang Maxwell's silver hammer Came down upon her head Bang, bang Maxwell's silver hammer Made sure she was dead Ho, ho, ohh P.C. 31 said we caught a dirty one Maxwell stands alone Painting testimonial pictures Oh, oh, oh, oh Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery Say he must go free The judge does not agree And he tells them so Oh, oh, oh But as the words are leaving his lips A noise comes from behind Bang, bang Maxwell's silver hammer Came down upon his head Bang, bang Maxwell's silver hammer Made sure he was dead, whoa Bang, bang Maxwell's silver hammer Came down upon his head Bang, bang Maxwell's silver hammer Made sure he was dead Wh-wh-wh-whoa Whoa Whoa-o-whoa Whoa-o-whoa Wha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha Well, they had Sergeant Pepper's silver cornet. One down, three to go. Jubilant, they returned to the Computerettes for additional guidance. One down, three to go. The bass drum was easy. Mustard left it, Billy found it. Shh! Just like that. Congratulations. Two down, two to go. They hugged each other andjumped forjoy, some of them. Let's go back to work. There's still two instruments missing. Take the tuba to Father Sun. Marvin Sunk, now known as Father Sun, was an unemployed school-crossing guard at the bottom ofhis life... when he suddenly got the idea to drop the ''K''from his last name. Well, that move lit up his life and it's been uphill ever since. He decided to go into the media business... and help destroy the minds of those young people... who teased him on their way to school. Now he was busy brainwashing them for F. V.B. to build an army to take over the world. We hate love! We hate joy! We love money! We hate love! We hate joy! We love money! We hate love! We hate joy! We love money! We hate love! We hate joy! We love money! Ahh ahh Because the world is round It turns me on Because The world Is round Ahh Ahh Because the wind is high It blows my mind Because The wind Is high Ahh ahh Love is old Love is new Love is all Love is you, sweetie Because The sky is blue It makes me cry Because The sky Is blue Ahh ahh ahh ahh Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh Ahh ahh ahh ahh Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh-- Could Billy survive 10,000 volts? It was a lot more than normally came through his guitar. Frankly, he was shocked. Stunned and unconscious, only the power of true love could revive the injured Billy. Let me take you down 'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields Nothing is real And nothing to get hung about Strawberry Fields forever Living is easy with eyes closed Misunderstanding all you see It's getting hard to be someone but it all works out It doesn't matter much to me Let me take you down 'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields Nothing is real And nothing to get hung about Strawberry Fields forever No one, I think is in my tree I mean, it must be high or low That is,you know you can't tune in but it's all right That is I think it's not too bad Let me take you down 'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields Nothing is real And nothing to get hung about Strawberry Fields forever Always know sometimes think it's me But you know I know when it's a dream I think I know I mean Ah yes, but it's all wrong That is I think I disagree Let me take you down 'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields Nothing is real And nothing to get hung about Strawberry Fields forever Strawberry Fields forever Strawberry Fields forever Let's not play. Stop.! Stop.! Stop.! Stop.! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! The boys were really desperate. There was one instrument still missing... and now there was no way to find it. Heartland was in desperate condition, seething with corruption. B.D. was desperately canceling concerts everywhere. He was losing his cool, his profits... and his hair. Things were really desperate. But Dougie came up with a great idea--a giant benefit. Musical artists from all over would come to Heartland... for a concert that would save the town. And Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band wouldjoin them. That was bound to get the boys back on the road. For the benefit of Mr. Kite There will be a show tonight on trampoline The Hendersons will all be there Late of Pablo Fanque's Fair What a scene Over men and horses hoops and garters Lastly through a hogshead of real fire In this way Mr. K will challenge the world The celebrated Mr. K Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishop's Gate The Hendersons will dance and sing As Mr. Kite flies through the ring, don't be late Messrs.

V.B. Central... where the evil genius would suppress the magical instruments... and make the world safe for his corrupt legions. Bring the instruments! Our army is ready! It was the end of decency, unless the band could get there in time to stop him. Now when I get older losing my hair Many years from now Will you still be sending me a valentine Birthday greeting Bottle of wine If I'd been out till quarter to 3.00 Would you lock the door Oh, will you still need me Will you still feed me when I'm 64 You'll Be older too Jealous?

The boys were traveling like the wind, and that was the problem. Heartland's fastest pursuit could not keep up with Mustard's evil engines. Mr. Mustard, look what I found. Now you're gonna get it! They were about to confront the villain in his lair. F. V.B., the evil force that would poison young minds, pollute the environment, and subvert the democratic process... and worst of all, change Strawberry into a mindless groupie-- this was the enemy-- F.
