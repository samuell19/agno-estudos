a film by Costas Kapakas -Carouzos here. -Stefanos, it's you? -Yes. Who is it? -Finally, I found you! Manolis, here. -Manolis who? -Manolis Markatos. -Markatos who? -Carouzos, you forgot everything. Thallasinos, Malandris, Markatos. Manolis! It's you? Where are you? What're you doing? Unbelievable! I'm at work you know. I wasn't expecting it. How're you doing? We've been out of touch so long... Do you know how long I was searching for you? -There've been some changes. -I spoke to your wife. -She told me that you got divorce. -Yes, it was a while ago. It is good that you didn't have any children. I finally found your mother. She barely remembered me. She's growing old. Lately she barely remembers me. Do you know the reason of my call? I'm having a party. -Fine! When? -Today! I am looking for you two weeks now. I have almost found them all. Almost everyone. There have been 30 years since the last party. I found Marina too. She isn't coming. -You know, children... -Fine I'll try to make it. Don't you dare not to come! I'm expecting you. -Ok? Bye. -Hey! What's the address? Do you remember my parent's home? I've changed everything. -OK. So long. -Bye! Let's hurry it up, Mrs. Youla. I've got to get dinner ready you know. You certainly skimped on the fabric, Mrs. Carouzos... I don't know if I'll have enough for the sleeves. This is where one can tell a good seamstress! If only you'd bought just a teeny bit more! Do you know how much this fabric costs? I won't be able to match the pattern and it will look bad. What can I do? Careful... That's right. Careful of the pins! -Isn't it a bit short? -I can let down the hem. But I saw in a French magazine that short skirts are in! -And you sure have the legs! -My husband will kill me! Nonsense! In the long run they all like it. Use the kitchen entrance! I've got news! -My sister-in-law Ariadne! -Be careful of the pins! What is it, baby? How did you do it? I bring you news! They're engaged to be married! There's never a moment's peace with this child! The marriage will take place here of course... Orthodox and Catholic! Real class! Let me take a look at your mouth. It's nothing. You just lost your first tooth. Come. let me show you. We'll sing a little song three times... and you'll throw your tooth as far away as you can. OK? Come on! Throw it! Now say hello to your cousin who has come to see you. Go on. Give him a little kiss. Put your arms around her. Kiss her. Go on! Kiss him... That's lovely, darlings! That's enough now. Enough! Enough! Now go and play in your room and be good. How's Aunt Venetia? Where is she? The battery's worn down... and she's quite deaf without her hearing aid. Old age... What can you do? It happens to the best of us... The show's about to begin. We don't want to miss it. Who's engaged? Haven't you heard? Princess Sophia. At last, the darling! And you know who she's to marry of course... Don Juan Carlos of Spain! Not like her brother who wants to marry a movie star! No way! He'll marry whoever the Queen tells him to! If your husband were to hear you... Yeah... like I'm afraid of your brother... It flew on the roof... took the tooth and will bring me the ring. You're lying. I didn't see any bird. Let's go and I'll show you. Quiet so they don't hear us. Hold on to me. What's the bird like? It's big and black and it's got a pointed beak. Maybe it's Aunt Venetia's bird. Yes, that's it. This is the locked room. Stefanos, we'll wake her up. No way. Auntie sleeps like a log. Dear God! What happened now? Keep your hands away from the buttons! The doctor's on the third floor! I said the third! Dear God, why me? If your temperature doesn't go down, I'm calling the doctor. Whether you like it or not! What's that child doing in the bathroom all this time? Stefanos! Hurry up in there. Your father's ill. I want the hot water bottle. I want to die. I'm the one who'll die. That rascal will be the death of me. Hurry up. You've got school tomorrow. I knew it. Using all that cologne at this hour of night. You go to sleep right now. You've got school tomorrow. Tell him to say his prayers. Did you hear that? Your prayers! Right now! Get up! Get up! My God! Would you look at that fog! Wake up! Get up! I said get up, you Iazybones. What's this? Where did you get this, you bum? You should be ashamed of yourself! Where did you find it? Who's the bum who gave it to you? It's Dad's. Shame on you. You're lucky he's sick and sleeping, otherwise... I didn't sleep a wink all night. Darn you! I'll show you what I'm going to do with this! Big deal... Hurry up and eat while I go and get your coat. It's very cold today and the fog goes right through you. Winter's come suddenly before I could get out warm clothes. I'm afraid you may smell the mothballs a Iittle. I'm worried about your Dad. He's been sick a lot lately... And his heart... they've got to run some tests. You're late! Hurry up! And don't count on Nikos giving you a ride in this weather. You'll walk to school like all the other kids. D'you know what time your cousin Marina leaves every day? Marina's dumb. I'm not speaking to her. You don't say! Since when? You two were... Just as well... Well anyway finish up. Nikos said he's not picking you up. D'you know what Nikos was in the war? All I know is he's disabled and because he likes you... you've got him taking you to school so you can sleep late. Lazybones! He was a flight navigator. Know what they did? They charteded courses and positions... and flew at night and in fog without radar... and when they said on the radio transmitter... that they'd be flying over at such and such an hour... -over such and such a place. -Enough! Have it your way. I just have one thing to say to you. Have you seen the photograph of Aunt Venetia's husband? How young he was when he left her a widow? Come on. Get up. -What's your name, son? -Stefanos Carouzos. -What was that? -Stefanos Carouzos. Why aren't you singing our national anthem? I have a sore throat, Sir. You have a sore throat... What's that in your pocket? Let me see. Show me! What's the lesson today? What's the lesson today, class? Algebra! So do you solve the algebra equation or plug in the heater? Now... Let's see... Karaliopoulos... Karoudas... and Lambrou to the blackboard. MANOLIS+MARINA=LOVE Loudly and clearly so I can hear what you're writing... Go to the blackboard Carouzos! You sit down. Continue. What are you staring at? It looks like Chinese to you? Continue. What's that you're writing, Carouzos? What gibberish! Don't you look at me like that! You won't get away from me! You're getting a ''D''! ''D''! ''D''! ''D''! What happened to the elastic bands? Stefanos! Pavlos! Catch him! I'm going to kill him! -What happened? -They want to kill me! Save me! Get away from behind there! Look what he did to me! Just you wait till I get my hands on you! Come here you rascal! Stefanos isn't a rascal. Will you tell me what he did? You plan to kill us all? If you lay a hand on him you'll have me to deal with. I'll talk to you later. Out of respect for Aunt Venetia... Get the hell out of here. See what he did to me! He's just a boy! Thanks. Promise you'll try and be a good boy Stefanos? YES AUNTIE. OK, guys. Listen up. Whoever collects the whole set with the saints... gets to carry a cherubim at the Good Friday litany. Saint Nectarios! Caravelle! Jet aircraft. Two engines, 120 seats. -Give it to me. -Here. Ilyushin, 4 engines, 150 seats. Saint Haralambos, the Martyr. -Boeing 727. -Two turbines. I'll give you my Saint Anargyros. Anyone eIse? McDonnell Douglas DC8. I'll Iet you have Mary Magdalene. -Will you give me the ring? -No. But you promised...It's been years since we took it. I did! You'll get it when you grow up and it fits. It fits now. Give it to me and you'll see. No it doesn't. You'll only lose it. -Let's try. -Didn't you try last summer? -I've grown a lot since then. -But you're still skinny. That's right, Michalis... the aunt's loaded. -Really? She has that much? -She sure does. You know the pension she gets? And what does she do with it? Nothing... She must have stashed away God knows how much... Plus she freeloads off me. Doesn't give me a penny. -What does she do with it? -So how big a pension? A pilot's widow... we're talking big money. That room upstairs she's got locked all the time... that's where the secret's hidden... that's where she keeps it all, tied up in rolls. And you know at whose expense? Yours and mine. Right! Like you've ever paid taxes! God bless us civil servants! I may not pay taxes but I have to keep the IRS boys happy! When was the pilot killed anyway? His plane crashed in '26. They got married... A few days later he left on a reconnaissance flight and... They found him but... -So Auntie may still be... -What? I mean d'you think she's ever done it? We'll never know. But since then... ''ferme''... What hasn't Auntie done? What does ''ferme'' mean? Is it Turkish? ''Ferme'' is French and it means ''closed''. ''Ferme''... closed... Let me just try it on once. Fine. Turn the other way. Turn around. The meat smells wonderful! Make some room. What a spread! Come on! Sit down everyone! It looks well done. Pour me a little wine. The wine's a lovely colour. So... Christ is risen! Amen! Cheers! So... shall we dig in? Come on, Auntie, let me take care of you. Have some meat, not just potatoes. Everything's delicious. What a wonderful smell! If only we'd had such a meal during the German occupation! It's been 20 years, Michalis and it's still on your mind? You're too young to remember. What hunger! And what a lovely shirt Stefanos is wearing. What are those things on it? This is a Dakota... a Spitfire and a Leica. You'll see the Russians will get to the moon first! Imagine the Americans going and finding them there! It's a present from Aunt Ellen in America... She sent me a lovely dress... You should see the fabric. It never wrinkles! Nylon! It'll all be nylon from now on... even the food we eat! Even my wife's wig is made of nylon! Cheers everyone and may we never have another occupation! Christ is risen! Amen! And with a little more brain... -Stefanos has plenty of brains. -You're telling me! And a husband for Nikoletta. This year! It will happen! She's still young. Of course she is. Nikoletta, you must be the same age as Sophia... Sophia who? The princess of course. That woman doesn't have a brain in her head! Don't pay any attention. You know women... She has to keep talking about the king. I agree with you there! I can't stand them. That's more like it! Cheers and may the king die! Heaven forbid! What happened to that judge you were dating? Ancient history. He must be a Super Court Justice by now. -Supreme Court Justice. -So what did I say? You said Super Court Justice... when you should have said Supreme Court Justice. Well anyway, that's what I meant. Nikoletta's got a new boyfriend and she's in love! Tell us all about him! Tell us! What line of work is he in? He's a musician. A musician? That's right. A musician. Is he in pop music? I'll be leaving you now. I'm going to lie down. Stay a littIe longer, Aunt. This is when the party begins. It's still early, Auntie! We're going to sing now! I'm afraid I'm too tired. You all have a good time. Help your auntie up! Have a nice rest. Go on, Marina. Run along. -Have a nice rest! -Thank you. And you have fun. Poor aunt... She's not very well. That's lovely. Bless you, children. Thank you very much. Have a nice rest, Aunt Venetia. -Thank you very much. -That's the locked room. And you be good now. I'II go get the accordion! Yes! Go get it! Cheers! Here's to us! Why did you stop? I'II go get some fruit. Where d'you think you're going? You mean we can't sing? Don't we have democracy here! Democracy? Go sing in Russia and see where they'd send you! Every village in the USSR is full of peopIe's choirs. Sure and in the Siberian labor camps they sing! You're a reactionary right-winger and I'm leaving! Go ahead! Think you can come here and sell us your commie bullshit! What's gotten into you two! We were having such a nice time! A nice time? The people are starving! Don't talk to me about the people. Even during the occupation you never went hungry! Think I don't know what you did? You weren't even in the army! I fought! I was wounded! See! Where were you? In the mountains with the people's army! Really? When? For how long? Did you go to pick oregano? Enough's enough. Come on, Ariadne! Let's go! -Stop it! -Go ahead! Coming here and raising a clenched fist in my house! You're lying! I raised a cIenched fist? Come on! Let's go now. Where's Marina? You go and never set foot in my house again. Hardly your house! Wait till she kicks the bucket first! I'll kill him! -Come on, Michalis! Let's go! -Please sit down! They must be up in his room. I'll go check. Fancy telling me I was picking oregano! Now try finding her! Those two kids are together and they're up to something. Just you wait till I get my hands on him! I'll give him such a hiding! I'll beat the living daylights out of her. Just you wait till I find her! You'll see where I'll send her! You send her to Russia... I'll send her to Siberia! To Irkutsk! I'll send him to that strict boarding school! They're in there! Help! Come here, you rascal! You're going to boarding school! You're Mrs. Carouzos? Stefanos' mother? Yes, why? That's good. May we come up? Please do... I was cleaning and... -What's this all about? -Your son Stefanos. This way please. I'm listening. Where does one begin, Mrs. Carouzos. Congratulations on your son. Fine upbringing you're giving him! I don't understand. What happened? Your son broke the fifth commandment. -Thou shalt not steal! -In church! What did he steal? These... Unfortunately... and in church... Stefanos hasn't brought such things home. Mrs. Carouzos! What do you mean? Things! These? And what's even worse... he was selling them! Trading them! What matters is that he's going to the bad... Doing the devil's work... -He must go to confession... -Repent... Be punished... Leave that to us. In any case his father will be coming home and... For shame! Such homes in our parish! In our church! You're the sinner... The fifth commandment... In our church... You're the sinner! Good thing Auntie collected cups and saucers... It was as if she knew... Now what happened? Please sit down. Nothing happened. I want to talk to you. Careful, Marina. You take the small tray. Alcestes, darling. We're going. You go and get ready. It's almost time. You know Aunt Venetia loved us like we were her own children. The poor thing was unlucky. Her husband's plane crashed... a few days after their wedding... so she couldn't have children of her own. Her sister, my mother had five... so she gave me to her... and she raised me as her own. She left us this house and everything else she owned. To you she left all her life's savings. She loved you. So you could study whatever you like wherever you like. And with the will in her drawer... we also found this envelope. For you. Aunt Venetia. Hello, darling! Yes, we're all set. It's Ariadne. She says if we'd like to go with the car. I don't think so... You know Pavlos... never changes... Even if we had spaceships he'd still take the train. Yes, we have tickets. Hello, Michalis. Good morning. No, don't come by. I'll put him on. 'Bye for now. See you soon. Hello, Michalis. Stefanos! Where are you? You're here? That's enough! We're leaving. You'll be at the seaside for two whole weeks! Congratulations! What make? You don't say? How come you didn't get a Moskovich? Better not. It'll be too crowded. We have tons of stuff. You know your sister. A closet full of clothes... OK. We'll see who gets there first. The taxi's here! Have a good trip and drive safely! Thank you so much. You're on vacation too? It was about time. You too? Of course. Alexandros should spend some time at the seaside. What with school all winter and all that studying... We thought we'd get away for a while. Right, Alexandros? I agree. Spending some time by the sea will be good for me. What grade are you in, Alexandros? This year I was in first. Next year second. You're the same age as Stefanos! What a nice name! So what grade did you graduate with? At which hotel will you be staying? We've booked at the Esplanade. What a coincidence! That's where we're staying! How lovely! The children will spend time together. Glad to meet you,Ma'am. Carouzos... My husband... Mrs. Prapas. Doctor's wife. Nice to meet you. What grade did you graduate with this year, Alexandros? ''A'' of course. Good for you! How about you, Stefanos? I also won first prize in our school essay contest... and there's every reason to believe I'll win first prize.. in the regional contest. Well done, Alexandros! What was the essay on? ''Savings'' Wonderful... How about you, Stefanos... Did you write an essay on: ''Savings''? Tell me, Alexandros... What do you want to be when you grow up? A nuclear physicist! How about that! What are those books you have there? My schoolbooks for the second grade. What did you bring with you? He has time. We're on vacation. Really! Vacation from what? Studying? By September he'll have forgotten how to write! Sit down! You don't know what we go through... You can't imagine what his spelling is like! How do you spell receive? with i e... Receive with i e?? PIease calm down, PavIos. It's not the end of the world. We're on vacation... and you have your heart... Your souvlaki... -No, no... -For you? -Souvlaki? -No thank you. You know whose fault it is? Ever since he inherited her money,he doesn't give a damn! He's become a real pest. She's the one who put the idea of aviation in his head. You know he's always had a passion for airplanes. -That's all he cares about. -Airplanes? Too dangerous... I'd never allow Alexandros. You can't imagine what we go through! See this, doctor? It's from one of Stefanos' planes! Stefanos! D'you want us to become friends? I teach you spelling, you teach me to fly planes at my Dad! Don't go too deep! Stay where you can touch bottom! Come out now. Enough. Come on, children. Let's have our picture taken. Come on, Marina! Alexandros! Come here! You sit in the middle, Marina. Here in front. That's right. Closer together so you're all in the shot. Smile please! Very nice. With a figure like hers you can wear anything... D'you know what she's wearing underneath? -What? -A bikini. So what? I brought a bikini too even though I haven't worn it! She's staying at our hotel. -And how do you know? -I just do. I also know her room number... 39... I saw her handing in her key at the front desk. -I also know her profession. -What is it? The oldest in the world! The woman of 39... Why don't you go for a stroll, children... -OK, but without Marina. -And why is that? Because we want to take a piss. Well that changes things! -Your hats, boys! -Your hat, Alexandros! And hurry back! -Did you get it? -Sure I got it. Do you smoke, Ariadne? Just pretending... it's so stylish! And now dear friends, a dance for the tall... and the short... for the slim and the plump... for young and old... We have to dance this. Come on! Of course we will. Come on, Michalis! Later. -Come on, Pavlos! -I don't dance the mambo! Then us girls will dance it alone! You too children! Come on! -Shall we dance? -Let's. And now, friends... for all those in love... Stefanos! Marina! Mom! You still haven't learned how to knot your tie? I wasn't the one who untied it. Hush! It's not good for a tie to be left with the knot. A nice big knot, OK? Where are you off to? Manolis' party. I told you about it. What time will you be back? -Will there be food? -Do I know, Mom? It's a party! But they'll have Coca-Cola! -Where did they get them? -The American air force base. You're all set. -What about my allowance? -Your Dad. -Tell him. -Keep me out of it. You go and apologize to him. You know him. He says things he doesn't mean sometimes. Always the same old story. Come September I'm out of here. I'm going to England and that's final. If it weren't for Aunt Venetia you wouldn't be going anywhere. It's not England he objects to it's what you want to do. Couldn't you study something else like law for instance? Or become a civil engineer even? And do what? Turn our house into an apartment building? Anyway, do as God guides you... Go wherever you like and study whatever you like. That's not what I wanted to talk to you about. I wanted us to talk about Marina. What about Marina? Ariadne called and asked some strange questions... about you and Marina. So what did you tell her? What could I say? I acted dumb! Stefanos, son... You're not children any more. I know of course that Marina is also a sensitive girl... but she's your first cousin. You grew up together. If your Dad finds out... and there's his heart... Will she be at the party too? Marina is Manolis' girlfriend. -Help yourself. -I'll pass. Good idea. Besides, don't let the packet fool you, they're domestic! That's a good one! So how's it going? Could be worse. You're really leaving in September? What's the matter with Malandris? He got dumped. -By Anna? -That's right. But guess who she's dating! The tall jerk. He came and picked her up in his Dad's car. Poor guy. Anna's cousin... what was her name... Maria? You like her, right? She left with them too. See that, my friend! One car, two chicks! D'you know who I'm starting to like, Manolis? -Who, man? -Christina. Yes but another chick's stuck on you. -Who, man? -Give me a break! Who, you jerk? Only I'm stuck on her too! Here we go again! Marina's my cousin. We grew up together. Anyway, she's in love with you. -Cut it out. -Wanna bet? Give me a cigarette and cut the crap. Can't you see? So how come she's dancing with another guy and looking at you? But that's women for you. Always the wrong guy. Remember that! What was Manolis saying? That he's stuck on you. That's not enough. Is it? So try harder. Good thing you came, Stefanos. I finished up earlier than I expected. Everyone came... well... almost everyone. -Cigarette? -Domestic? No! They're the genuine article now! So how's business? You know my company's doing real well... Europe... the Balkans... -Your Dad's company? -That's right. So what accident are you investigating now? The military plane that crashed a couple of weeks ago. -What was the cause? -Seems it was wrong handling. Wrong handling, eh? Manolis! We're leaving. Stefanos! It's Katerina! You don't recognize me! Hello! You have a new message. Stefanos, it's me Marina, your cousin. They called me from the hospital. They couldn't find you. Your mother.... ...is in the emergency room. -My mother, please... -Hold on, Maria... Yes? Alcestes Carouzos, my mother. She's here. When was she admitted? Today... I don't know. Maybe a short while ago. Do you know what ward she's in? What does she suffer from? I don't know... in emergency? Just a moment. Alcestes Carouzos. Yes. Carouzos. She was admitted at 21: 30. -Room 606, 6th floor. -Thanks. Hello, Maria... Translated by Elly Petrides Subtitles by tvaddict.
