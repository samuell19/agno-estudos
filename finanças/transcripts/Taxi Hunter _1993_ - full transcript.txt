Hey, level with me. Are you sure your informer's reliable? Some of his information is, some isn't. If we got it right every time, you would've been promoted. - You don't have to stick with me! - You stink! Have a spray! Let's go. - Stop eating. - Let me finish! $24. Thank you. I wouldn't go over there no matter what. Undercover for 20 days for nothing. I want to throw up every time I'm here. Hey, it's an ambush, how can you expect to get results the first time? Yeah? Is that your pager? Don't mess around. It's mine. The boss wants me to go and report in. Hey, take a taxi. Move! - Hey, where to? - North Point. No... I'm off duty. Just go! Police! Drive! Hurry up! Fucker! Freeze! - Hey! Go! Hurry! - Come over here! Hold it! Get in! Blacky! That dork's really fierce. - Call the hearse. - Hearse? What about me?! Then call the ambulance, too! Stop the car! Damn fucker! Fucker. Gave me more work?! Good morning, colleagues. I called this meeting because I have exciting news for you. Our group is responsible for 25% of the total sales volume. I'm very satisfied with your performance, especially Kin. You should all learn from him. His sales are three times as much as yours. And he's handled the project with the Bank of America very well. Therefore, I've decided to let him handle the project with ABN AMRO next month as well. Any questions? We will try to work hard and assist Kin like we did last month. Remember, our clients buy insurance to bet against their lives. We bet that they stay alive. So let's bless our clients now. To good health. Meeting adjourned. Hey, Kin. Keep working hard. You've got a bright future and lots of money. I'm going to promote you to senior next month. You should only say that if you mean it, boss. I won"t mess with you. Let's go to lunch. Hey, Kin. Hey, the boss has big expectations of you, and that's not good. If you can't achieve the same quota as this month, you'll be fucked. Fatty... you're really fat. - Hey, lunchtime. - Let me tidy this up first. - Hello? 8888 reply call. - Pager station. Your wife wants you to come home for dinner early. Thank you. Come in. Boss! Good health, good health forever! You found nothing in an ambush, walked clumsily and stumbled into folk, ran into the thief on the street and couldn't catch him as per. Bear with me! Right, Ming's now injured. You've been assigned a new partner. - May I ask who? - The one who saved you. No way, boss! The entire department knows he's crazy. He'll do anything to catch a criminal. His partner ends up dead or handicapped. Or their parents don’t get shit. Or they end up impotent. Come in. Sgt. Yu Kai-Chung reporting for duty. Sergeant Yu, this is your new partner. Hi! My idol! You're the idol of all the police! All the gangs in Hong Kong are fearful upon hearing your name. Sergeant Yu? Congratulations! I've fallen in love with you. You're my idol! Let me kiss you later. - Sergeant Yu, you-- - That's fine. Let me handle it. I'll take care of Sergeant Yu. Sergeant Yu, c'mon, I'll show you around. C'mon! Good...bye! Sergeant Yu, c'mon, I'll show you the briefing room first. - Goh, good morning. - Good morning! - Hey, don’t be so formal. Call me Chung. - Goh, good morning. Good morning! - Hey, bro. - Good morning. I guess you did rather well; even the senior calls you 'bro'. No, | haven’t closed a case for a really long time. I forgot to tell you, my name's Mak. Call me Sai-Goh [West-Bro]. They're calling me Goh. They can’t call Sai, right? - So I'll call you Goh, too. - Great. Good boy! - Blind Fai. - Receiving. - I'm on Harbour Road, you? - I'm nearby. Someone just rear-ended me. Come and help me rip off this guy. You fucker! Can you drive? Bro, you cut in front of me and stopped. There was nothing I could do. Are you for real?! I was stopped for a while, and you just smashed into me! Your bumper's just dented a little, but my headlights are all broken. A little? You gonna compensate me? How much do you want, then? $5,000. What?! A little dent's worth $5,0007? I don't have enough cash. What about $1,000? Not enough cash? What about that? - Hey, are you done yet? - He only wants to pay me $1,000. Oi! Don't bullshit me. - How much do you want? - $5,000. - Bro, don't lean on me. - You damaged his car, yet accuse him?! - Pay $5,000, and save yourself a beating. - Pay up! - I'll pay. - Hurry! Hurry up! I'll pay. - Go! - What are you looking at? What a bunch of bullies. Honey. How are you? Has the baby kicked you today? Darling, you promised you would get home by half six. What time is it now? Right, I had a car accident. - Are you okay? - I'm okay. - What about the car? - The car's, of course, damaged. - What'll we do? - It's alright, don't ask any more. You went out on your own again? And bought so much as well? Hey, I put $10,000 on your credit card. Would that be a problem? - No. - That's a bargain! This was only $8,800. - Does it do a date stamp? - Think there's a button on the side. We need the date stamp to know what the baby looks like in what date. Hey, I've bought some baby clothes. It's beautiful. - Isn't it cute? - Yeah. Oh no, I’m worried. If it's a boy and not a girl, how can he wear it? - Then we'll have a girl next year. - Who wants to have a girl with you? Isn't Chung coming for dinner? Where is he? It's late. Yeah. He's always late. Maybe he's out chasing a criminal. Let's clear this stuff and not embarrass ourselves in front of our guest. I'll help you. Hey, get that bag as well. Darling, I'll put the baby cot back in our room today. Forget it, you're pregnant. You shouldn't push a cot around. When the baby gets older, we'll need a bigger room anyway. If the baby sleeps with us, he'll be closer to us in the future. No. You scream so loudly during lovemaking. It would scare our baby. Get the door. Hey, always late! - What time is it? - King of being late. Sister-in-law. - Hurt your head again? - I bumped my head whilst chasing a crook. - Are you alright? - Are you hungry? Of course I'm hungry! I knew she was going to cook me dinner. I didn't even have lunch. I'm starving! You sweet-talker. Don't teach my husband that. - I'm going to cook. You have a chat. - Thanks, sister-in-law! Hey, your belly's getting bigger. What belly? This's a sign of success. I guess that means I haven't started yet. - You're doomed to be doing tough work. - What do you mean? If I weren't a cop, I could be a low-wage coolie. As for you... if anything happened, you'd starve to death. I"m not afraid, because you'll feed me. - Want a drink? - Same as usual. Hey! You've bought a lot of stuff. You should get married quickly. Hey, isn't it a bit early to buy baby stuff? It's not early. When the baby's born, we'll have no time to shop. Hey! Have some soup first. - There's soup! - She's such a great wife. Okay, let me help you, sister-in-law. We bought all the girls' clothes. Now the doctor said it's a boy. How could I know? It's still too early to call. How about what happened with Herman? The doctor said it was a boy; ended up being a girl. Herman has the look of a father-in-law. I'll get you home first. No, many are waiting for a taxi at this hour. Look! Lots of people. Hey! - Are you for real?! - We were first! Hey. You have a client appointment, don't you? You can go, I'm fine. Don't worry, I still have time, I'll get you home first. Wait here for me, I'll get the taxi over there. Don't let anybody push you, okay? Sorry, I'm pregnant-- No, my wife's pregnant. Darling... come here. - Sorry, bro. - Excuse us. It's fun to see you guys fighting for a taxi. Bro, if you don't have passengers like us, you'd be poor. Don't preach to me in my car. If you're not happy, you can get out. Brother Keung, sorry I'm late. I couldn't get a taxi. Say no more, sit down. - What do you want to drink? - Nothing. - Let me show you the insurance agreement. - It's okay. What is there that a gang boss like me hasn't seen? It's minor stuff, no need. No, Brother Keung, I must explain the details to you. Right, don't waste time on nonsense. Everybody in the underworld knows me, Muscle Keung. From Portland Street to Tsim Sha Tsui, everybody calls me Brother Keung. If I want a car or some thugs, I'll have them. And girls? They'll be lining down to Tsim Sha Tsui! With this matter, you must do it properly. I'll ask all my guys to buy from you, got it? Brother Keung, what do you mean? Can you make it cheaper? But it's already a bargain. It's only $580 a month. Money's not the problem, I mean my face. I understand. - Does it compensate for any injuries? - Yeah. Even gunshots? Gunshots? Sure! In our field, you'll need a gun. Do you want one? Only $10,000. No, thanks. What are you looking at, shithead? I'll blast your head! Brother Keung, let's get back to the agreement. Sure, what about my face? Brother Keung, say no more. The price can't be any lower. But your face... I can give you three months free out of my own pocket. How's that sound? Say no more. Order something to drink. Oi! Ignoring me? Don't make me fuck this place up! Don't mess about, out with it. What people did you hang out with last night? A junkie. - What key? - A junkie. - Someone who takes LSD or heroin. - Morning. - Where are they now? - Why do you wanna know? Why? What sort of people would hang out with a junkie? Non-negotiable! Let's go and smash them. - Where? - I'm not saying. - Want a beating? - Try it - Don’t push me. - Try it! - You think I need to try? - Goh, let me do it. - Alright, I'm tired now. You have a go. - You take a rest. - Thanks! - I really don't get it. A student like you, you've got a bright future. But you skipped school. Why take up drugs? If your parents found out, what would they think? My mum's dead. What about your father? If he knew he had a daughter like you, he'd dig a hole and hide in shame. You really are-- Hey, Goh! What are you doing? There's no hole. Can I hide under the table? - You're her father? - Don't we look alike? Sir, actually, I was only doing an interview with those junkies. This's my daughter, she just started a job as a TV news reporter. Always comes in for intel, but never gives me any in return. - Why didn't you say before? - Professional ethics. Can't just rat them out after interviews. You wouldn't reveal your informers, right? Still talking back? I'll pretend to beat you! Stop fighting. - Hello? - It's fake! Is that not permitted? Got it. Sir, there's a gang war on Lee Chung Street. - Hey, enough! - Go home and make soup! Hey, don't let it go so fast, you have to follow me. Stop moving. Look at this mess... Don't you want our baby to have a handmade sweater from birth? I do. If so, you have to stay still and be patient. - Oh, dear. - Hey, where are you going this time? Thunder. I need to get the laundry inside. Let me do it. No need. I'm only pregnant, not handicapped. Be good. Sit here and don't move. See? I told you. - Don't worry about them. - Let me take them. Of course you'd say that. You don't wash them. Never mind. I'll wash them again for you. Come in now. Are you okay? Are you alright? Sit down first. Slowly. No! Too bad the car's damaged. I'll call a taxi. Hello? It's 20 Village Road, Happy Valley, a taxi to Tsan Yuk Hospital. Alright, $20 on top. Anything you want. Two minutes? Great. Honey, the taxi’s here. - Please. - Hello, what is it? - Can you take me to Aberdeen? - No, I'm on a call. I'll give you $50 more. $507 - Please. - $100. $100? Alright. - I forgot my purse! - Don't worry, I have money. Slowly, don't rush. You wait here, I'll open the car door. Shit! The taxi was just waiting here! - It hurts! - Slowly. Sit down slowly. Shit, you're bleeding! I'll call the ambulance! Stop! - Bro! - What is it? - Please take my wife to the hospital! - No, I'm off duty. - Please! - Whatever. $100 on top. - Great! - Quickly, get in! Honey, there's a car! C'mon. Slowly, don't worry, it's alright. Hey! All that blood? No way! Please have a kind heart, bro. My wife's going into lab our. It's your wife who's in lab our, not mine. Off you go. I'm off duty! Oi! Honey, help! Stop the car! Darling! I'm fucked this time! - Do you remember the car's plate? - No. Okay. We'll look into this case. - Does he remember the car plate? - He says he couldn't. Kin. Don't worry, it's alright. Doc, how's my wife? Sorry, we've tried our best. We can't save your wife or the baby. Sorry. Darling. Darling. Darling. Darling. - Darling! - Kin. Darling. Kin! Doctor! Doctor! TOMB OF BELOVED WIFE LEE MEI-SAN Hello? Sorry. I'll help you make the arrangements at once. Sorry. John, arrange a physical examination for this client. Mr Wong, there's no client ID number on the agreement you gave me yesterday. I'll ask him. Also, Mr Wong, Mr Chan called. He was waiting for you all morning. Alright, I'll call him. Thanks. Kin, don't be too downhearted. Some things you can't change. Let's talk about it later. Hey-- Hey, Kin, your wife will rest in peace. My friend was married for six months, and his wife died. Your wife died after a year of marriage. That's not too bad. I only wanted to console you. What's the matter? Nothing. Hey, Brother Kin, what's got into you? You've not been doing your job for a week. You've lost several accounts. How can I promote you? I understand you're not feeling good. But I've given you one week's vacation. You know I'm loved by all our colleagues. You need to learn from me. You need to leave problems at home. If I were you, even when I'm down, I still need to perform at work. If you want a vacation, it's no problem. Just tell me how long. A month? One year or two? It's alright with me. I'll ask Fatty to take over. It's minor stuff. It's minor stuff. Hey, miss, $30 more. Look at the meter, it's not enough. - What nonsense! - What?! I've asked if you'd go across the harbour. I've given you $10 more. What do you want? I said I'd go. I didn't say $10 was enough. That's all I have. You can take it or leave it. Come on, pay up. Don't waste my time! It's you who's wasting my time! What do you mean?! Give it to me! Nice one! How are you? You alright? Don't drink any more. Why? Remember when you used to make me drinks? It's different from that. What's different? - It's late, let"s go. C'mon. - If you want to leave, you can go. We used to come and go together! And we used to get drunk before leaving. Fine. Let's drink up. Chung... you really are a good guy. Hey. I'll take you home, you're so drunk. I'm okay. You go home. How can you go home like this? Just go. Don't worry about me. I'm worried about you. Let's go. No need. Then give me a call after you get home, alright? You're even more annoying than my wife. Alright, I'll head on. Go, go on. Excuse me. - Where to? - Happy Valley. - It's $30 more. - Why charge me more? Are you going or not? Alright. Nothing but bad luck and lousy fares. Even have to take a drunkard. Hey! Don't throw up and foul my car, or I'll make you lick my car clean! Bro, how come you're taking this route? This is a shortcut, no traffic lights. I live here, I know you're taking a long route. You've already asked for $30 more. Am I not taking you there? Who cares about money when getting a taxi? Stop nagging! That's right. I should thank you for driving me home so late. You're a grown man! Why are you crying? Stab you to death! Please stay back. Don't interfere. There's nothing to see. Please stay back. What's up? - The car fell into the gutter, right? - Morning, Goh. Morning. Officer Yu, good morning. - Let's take a look. - Alright! Damn! Back off. - Officer Yu! - Hey, bro, what's up? A taxi driver was killed. - Find anything? - Nothing. From initial observations, we don't think it's a robbery. There's nothing to see. Hey! Don't try to push your way in! I said there's nothing to see. Don't push any further, okay? - Hey! - Hey, Dad, you're here? Of course, anything that happens in this area is my business. - Hey, c'mon, let me in to take pictures. - That's not right! Really... Right, I'll make shrimp for you tonight? Shrimp? And the chilli sauces. Alright. However you want it. - Bro, let her in. She's one of us. - Okay. - Thanks. - Oi! What are you doing? - Oi! Are they with you? - They are. - What's so special about TV? - What? - Bias! - It is bias! How can you tell I favour one eye over the other with my sunglasses on? - How cocky is he?! - I was born like that. - Officer Yu, you're here? - How did you get in here? - Your dad let you in? - Doesn't matter. - Hey, I need some first-hand information. - No comment right now. Hey, are you really treating me like this? - Hey, Goh, what's with this? - Hey, Dad, your partner! - Hey. - Goh, are you for real? How can you let her in? There are lots of people watching. Officer Yu, it wasn't his doing. How about this? Come to our house for dinner. Hey, my girl's a good cook! I can't, I've got a friend who's upset. I need to stay with him. No biggie, just ask him to come with you. Sorted! Hey, brother, we've got to go back and finish the report. You keep watch here. - What should we do with this place? - Let's go. Excuse us! Nothing to look at! Go! Nothing to see! Kin, don't be like this. I'm having dinner with a friend. Why don't you come with me? Let's talk about it later. Let's eat! Bring it here. Hey, fill up your glass. There. Shrimp! Great! Hey, give me two more. C'mon! - Hey, where's your friend? - He's not coming. Let's eat. Well, too bad for him. Goh, are you having the shrimp or the soy sauce? My dad eats shrimp for the soy sauce. This soy sauce is called filial soy sauce. My daughter's an expert at it. I suspect there's cocaine in it. So addictive! No wonder your piss smells like soy sauce! No way! You two grown men are together even when pissing? You see each other every day. Don't fall in love with each other. To avoid having a mother like you, - I'll tell you a good place to go. - Where?! Right, I just did an interview with the Big Boobs Cabaret. Why don't you guys go and see the show? And find some feminine vibes, or else... WELCOME Sorry it's late. - Four-flavour rice. - Are you here long? Don't! Told you we're not getting one. - No. I want it. - No! - Be a good boy. - I want it! - Yes, be a good boy. - You haven't finished your homework. I want it! - Shining card for $50. - No, we don't want it. - I want to buy it. - You haven't finished your homework yet. I don't like it! Kid, could you sell this Dragon Ball card to me? For an adult... $100. Not for me, it's for my son. Then... $50. Here. You keep the $100. You're a good kid. Let"s come back tomorrow. - Kid, my son wants you to have this card. - Thank uncle. - Thanks, uncle! - Good boy. Thank you very much. - Thank you! - Thanks. Boss, this one good for you? Whatever. Give her $500. As for the taxi fare, it's up to you. Take good care of the boss, got it? How are you doing, boss? Why don't you take a shower and relax, yeah? Could you have a baby for me? Alright. Let's see what I'll gain first? What do you want, then? Let's say I work five days a week and have ten clients a day. Altogether, I'm going to make over $100,000 a month. Excluding my periods, I'm going to have a million a year. Since you're so cute, I'll give you a 20% discount. Okay. Let's do it. No, I fear that if my wife knows, she won't like it. Your wife? Sorry. You're quite wasted. I'll make it worth your while next time. You're a really good whore. - Ten. - Jack. Queen. - Oi! - You lose. Wash the dishes. Look what you have done to Dad's hand. Would I be so stupid to put out my hand? - Hey, d'ya have to play so hard? - Are you for real? Driver, would you go to To Kwa Wan? Bro, I need a ride. Where would you like to go? - Where do you want to go? - Kwun Tong. I'm going to shift duty in Tsuen Wan, stupid. - I'll go to Tsuen Wan, then. - C'mon, get in. Bro, why didn't you take those two people? I'm driving the taxi. They didn't suit me. Why should I take them wherever they want? That means you're handpicking customers. Obviously! I need money. I go where I earn the most. Then why drive a taxi and not a bus? - What was that? - Nothing. I"m not going to Tsuen Wan now. I get off around the corner. Messing me about, mate? Even if you get off here, I'll have to charge your fare to Tsuen Wan. - A hundred. - Alright. Damn you! Fucker! Hit me?! Wanna leave? Damn fucker. Got a death wish?! Don't hit me! Help! Help! Damn fucker. I'll show you what a taxi driver's made of! Find me in Tai Wan Shan if you want! Go get some medicine! The size and weight of this gun are almost the same as a real one. This, this, and this, please. This is a Magnum, Clint Eastwood used this. It's a bit heavy. This is a Danning. Don't judge it by its size; it can put a hole in an elephant. But the bullets do jam sometimes. This is a Beretta, very user-friendly. - Last time I had a stand-off with-- - Alright! Say no more. - I want this one, then. - You sure? - No exchange. - Not quite. One week's guarantee if anything is wrong. No, we're just looking, not buying. Thanks. Hey, are we in agreement? I'll get the gun. Yeah. Let's split. I fear you. Bro, drive me to Aberdeen. Shift duty? Then why don't you cover your meter? You forgot? Do you remember to shit? Drive me to Princess Margaret Road for the interchange? I'm not going there. But you're going to hell. But you're going to hell. But you're going to hell. But you're going to hell. But you're going to hell! - Hey. You had dinner yet? - Hey. Yeah. Oi, you're late. Hey, I've got a great story. I just drove five blondes. They had great boobs! They were waggling when I changed gears. Made my nose bleed! - You're so bad! - Those boobs were huge! - Hey, has business been good? - Sure it has! I took an American from the airport to Tsim Sha Tsui. Hey, let's go. The meter was $28 HK, the idiot gave me $28 US. It was awesome! You're a lot luckier than me. - And you're still not satisfied? - Of course not! - Boss, how much? - $30, sir. - Do you have matches? - Yeah. Thanks. It's small fry, I even ripped the locals off. I did a full course once. - What’s a full course? - You're really green! That's to charge according to the meter for crossing the harbour. And get $10 extra. That's a full course. Got it yet?! - There's a car on fire. - I's my car! - Help! - Help put out the fire! We need water! Hey! Get some water! - Where to? - Sha Tau Kok. Hey, stop. - What is it? - Didn't you hear me? I said Sha Tau Kok. I Know. - I changed my mind. Wo Hop Shek, please. - What is it this time? Wo Hop Shek. Hey, stop. It's two in the morning now. If you take me there to the cemetery, you won't get a fare coming back. This is how our business works. We have to suck it up and go where we're told. Bro... you're a good driver. Keep the change. - Take that as my tip. - Hey, I charge according to the meter. Then take it as my treat. But we don't know each other. What the hell was that? A rare sight in this world. Hey, are you done yet? Hurry! It's very heavy, help me. You're such a pain in the arse! I’m charging you $30 more at least. Outta the way! What the hell's this? It's spilt all over my car! I'm not taking you. - Go! - Are you refusing a customer? What if I am? I don't want to take you now. - If my son were here, he would kill you. - Go on! - What? - Why aren't you taking this old lady? - Are you her son? - No. But you're a taxi driver, why don't you take her? Yeah. Give him hell, young man! He's bullying the elderly! Yeah, so what if I'm bullying you?! Take this old lady. Mind your own business! Take her. I don't want to. So what? Don't push me. Push? I'm going to beat you too! Good lad, a guy like him deserves it. Beat him! Search for the killer! - PROTECT TAXI DRIVERS - Taxi drivers are in danger. Taxi drivers are in danger. We want the police to offer a reward to catch the killer. We want the police to offer a reward to catch the killer. Brother Ping, c'mon, do me a favour. Film from my left side, it looks better. - Sure. No problem. - Dinner's on me. A meal would settle it! It's done. The Taxi Association has been monitoring the recent taxi driver murders. Many taxi drivers have gathered outside the police station to protest in the hope they'll increase protection for them. Taxi drivers are in danger. We want the police to offer a reward to catch the killer. We want the police to offer a reward to catch the killer. Taxi drivers are in danger. - What a scene! - Way out of order! Just like the market. How could they?! Granny, because you won't tell the truth, this is what happens. Granny, two taxi drivers were Killed in the last two months. You're the only witness. Please try your best to recall. I really was too frightened to remember! Spit it out! We could charge you for obstructing a cop! Don't worry, I won't sexually harass you. I remember now! - Tell us. - It was a man. - Damn! - What else? He wears glasses. What else?! Is this a peacock show? Hey, Goh, come here for a moment. Boss! Coming. Hey, want some pictures? There are many reporters downstairs. We're in trouble. You think it's a reward? - Did you get any clues from the granny? - She was playing peacock. Get on with it and ask her! Once you've asked, both of you come and see me. Hey, what did the boss want? Nothing, the boss made some abalone; he wants us to share it. - Hong. - Yeah? Help me sort this. He helped me, there's no way I'd rat him out. This is such a big mess, how can we fix this? Boss, we're investigating. Right, Goh? 'Investigating'. Have you found any clues? We've obtained some important clues. We know the suspect is a man with glasses. Hey, there are at least 400,000 such people in Hong Kong. - How can I report that to the top? - Just say you're one of the suspects too. This is no time for jokes. Boss. Two murders took place in the same district. Why don't we get someone to play a taxi driver and drive around the area? Maybe then we can find the clues. Goh, what do you think about that? Why don't we... do it? You're much fitter! You said it. Stay fit, in case you're out of a job. You can be a coolie. How's everything? Back to work yet? Let's talk about that later. Oh yeah, are things okay with you? No, still busy with the taxi killer case. Those taxi drivers deserved it. If they weren't so bad, why were they killed? You just hate taxi drivers. I don't hate them. Those taxi drivers deserved to die. Why are you looking at me like that? You think I'm the killer? It'll be good if you are. I can benefit from it. If I arrest you, I'll get a promotion. Have you any ideas how to deal with him? No, not a clue. I'll Kill ya! You bitch, I'll kill ya! I'll Kill ya! Be gentle. Be gentle. I'll Kill ya! Finished! Unbelievably quick! - Oi, Goh! - What? How can you be so sloppy? - What should I do, then? - Something like that?! Hey, I'm only act-- I'm only acting as a taxi driver. You think it's for real? Let's start work! Crazy. Oi, remember, - don't blow it. - Got it. Tell me the station and leave the location when you see the suspects. Got it? I don't need it... no need. I'm not as brave as you. I'm scared shitless. Hey, lads, play it by ear. Copy. Do you need a ride? I want to go home. Get in the car. C'mon, I'll help you up. What is this place? This isn't my home. It's not your home, it's our home. - What do you want? - I want to be a man. Help! No! Get away! Help! No! - Go away! - Stop acting! This can't be your first time! What are you acting for? What you looking at, perv? - What are you doing? - Making love! You call that lovemaking? Rather, you're making her do it. If you don't fuck off, I'll smack you! - Do you have a gun? - Gun, your arse! Trying to scare me with that gun? I've never been scared in my life! Is rape a lot of fun? Miss. Go home. C'mon, on you go. Don't be afraid. On you go. Thank you! Just imagine your wife or your mum being raped. What would you do then? But people like you don't have any imagination. If you were raped by a man, how would you feel? I don't know, it's never happened to me. What if I give you the gun, will you shoot me? No! Liar! - I will! - You'll never change. If I let you go now, will you rape again? No. It's hard to say! I know you must be thinking that I'm preaching to you. - You just need to read this part later. - Okay. Thanks. Here. Back to local news. Recently, there's been some taxi driver Killings. According to the investigation, the police think it's the same Killer. These cases have raised the attention of taxi drivers. Our reporter Mak Suet-Yan has interviewed many drivers to get their opinions. Here's her report. As a taxi driver, may I bother you for a few minutes? This is the third murder of a taxi driver, what are your thoughts on it? I don't know, could be revenge. There. She's my daughter. Pretty, right? Does she look like me? Like father like daughter! Hey, so your daughter drives a taxi? Looks more like a man. Yeah! I was talking about the reporter! - But it was the driver who was talking. - Whatever! Hey, pal, why do you think the three drivers were killed? They must've owed loan sharks money, so they were killed. Or maybe they crossed some gangsters. To be frank, being trapped in a car all day is exhausting. We could've been rude and upset others. Wouldn't you say? I don't think so. It must be a taxi driver-hating psychopath on a killing spree! Shut it! Who are you to speak? - What?! Why can't I speak? - Shut up! Hey! Don't! Keep it down. C'mon. This is my treat, sit down. - It's his treat. - I"m not broke. Yeah! You don't need to treat me. Nuts! - Place your order. - I's my treat! I said it's my treat. Everyone's gone crazy. Hey, last night, I was thinking. I might have found a way to bring the killer out. Right, remember when the granny said the Killer is a kind-hearted guy?? Let's make use of this and twist the facts via the media. Have them report a story saying he's a cold-blooded, granny-killing psychopath. Otherwise, get the TV to-- Oi! You don't respect me. A Justice of the Peace's talking to you! Here, let's get to work. Frankly speaking, trying to run into the Killer in this taxi's even more difficult than winning the lottery. - So you want to win the lottery? - No! - But you do! - That's right! By the way, our partnership possesses both wisdom and courage. So, are you wisdom or courage? I'm both! And you have nothing. - Here we are. - Thanks very much, Dad. - What, thank you? Pay up! - Are you for real? - What do you think? - Skip it. I've got a meeting. Hey. Whatever, go to your meeting. Dad, today's your birthday. I'll cook dinner for you. Today's my birthday? I forgot all about it. Stop play-acting, moustachio. Let's see if the department head will invite me for dinner first. Madam, what time are you off work tonight? Let me treat you to a blue movie. Don't mess around. The killer might get in your car. No kidding! Today's my birthday. My daughter's cooking dinner for me. We're celebrating. So great. Jealous? My daughter's nice to her dad. Sing Tao Evening Post. - Any Next Magazines? - Not out yet. Give me the East Magazine. - Here. - I need change. $1007? Any smaller notes? - Please take me to Happy Valley. - | can’t, sorry.

Goh's car is somewhere on Prince Edward Road. He needs backup. Received. On my way. Received. I'm going. Mate, do you know why they were killed? The first one asked for an excessive fare and took a longer route. The second one refused a customer, was impolite, and picky. So they deserved to die? The third one raped. This one deserved it! - The fourth... - There's a fourth one? The fourth one's taking me to Princess Margaret Road to interchange. Hey! He doesn't deserve to die! Also... my wife is dead because of a taxi driver. That's terrible. - Stop the car. - No, I'll drive you across the harbour! Stop. - No, I've got time. - Stop! Go to hell! Help! Help! Hey, pal!

He's in the hospital. - Let's go. - Got it. We're on the way. Go home and wait for news. Hey, Brother Hong, give me some inside information. Oh yeah, Yan, your dad was hurt. - Yan. - Where’s dad”? Your dad's in there. Go in. How's Dad? The doctor said he's no longer critical. Not serious. Dad. Dad! You watch over him. I've gotta head back to the station. I'm sorry.

I've done nothing wrong, I won't go! You've killed, and you say you've done nothing wrong?! I only killed a few taxi drivers without professional ethics. They deserved it. It doesn't matter if they have no ethics, it's not right to Kill! A taxi driver killed my wife and my baby. Was he right?! That was one driver who killed them, not anyone else's doing! I'm not taking revenge. I just can't stand to let those bad taxi drivers exist in this world. They deserve to be punished. And now, I'm the one to punish them! Hey, so it was him who killed the drivers! Lecturing me's no use! Punishment by killing is against the law! Don't you get it? Put down the gun, come with me to the station. Then, I can help you. You're lying. Arresting me is helping those taxi drivers. Give me the gun. I"m your friend. I'll help you. Give me the gun. - C'mon. - You're my friend. Don’t lie to me. No! I still can't! I must kill all those bad taxi drivers! Kin! Give me the gun. Don't come over! - We don't fear you! - That's right! Don't be afraid. There are plenty of us. It's real! - Oh, no! Run! - Kin! Kin, don't be rash! This is all down to you bastards! Kin! - Calm down. - Hey, beat the fucker! C'mon! Don't interfere! We'll beat you as well! Fucker! Don't move! Stop! Watch out! A fellow cop. Get the stretcher! Kin! C'mon. Don't be afraid, it's okay! I'll get you to the hospital. Be careful. This fucker murdered many of our fellow drivers. Is he still alive? His eyes were smashed. Enough already! Kin, don't worry, I'll help you. Chung. You're truly a great cop.
