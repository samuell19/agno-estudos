- You were the prettiest, Joy. - You're sweet. Ignore him. Stop looking at women! - She's beautiful. Do you know her? - She's Joy, a model. And this? Take a look. Yes, I like it. Here. It's beautiful. I'm in pretty good shape. You could lose a couple of pounds. But who could ever resist me? Right. So what are we doing tonight? - Meeting Irene and Karine. - Yes! - Hey! We should go to Captain Fouine's! - Great idea. I expect that's David. Okay, I'm going. I have to stop by the agency. There's no rush. - Stay for a while. - No, I can't. - Hello. - Hello! - Are you well? - Yes. What about me? Am I disturbing you? Sorry, David. I'm not avoiding you, but I have to see the agency. See you tonight, Margot. She's impossible to talk to. She runs away every time. And yet, she needs our help. Help? So, you want to make yourself indispensable? Why not me? - We have to tell her, one day. - What? She's running because she feels guilty. - Joy? - Yes. She was abandoned by her father. She took it as a punishment. She's afraid of being abandoned again, so she keeps jumping from man to man. Well, aren't you Mr. Know-it-all? That way. The door. Good for you? No problems. Hey, will the rhythm be okay? - Joy! How was it? - Great. Fantastic! Come through. - So you liked it? - Yes! Really? Yeah, but if I were you, I'd put more balls into it. Come for a drink? Later. I have something to give Alain. Okay, I'll be next door. You're out of line, by the way. What are you looking for? I'm looking for... Happy Birthday, Alain. You shouldn't have. What is it? Open it. I'll put the keys to our pad on there. - Alain, you know... - I know. All your other men are just verses, and I'm the chorus you'll always come back to. I'll be back soon. Jean-Luc, do me a favor and run the track back. Let's see how it sounds. - Want to play? - Yes. You know how? - You're the tank. - There. The red ones are bad. - And the green? - They're bad too. Don't worry. It's not easy! - Joy, darling! - Hello, Margot. Alain called me. He was very upset. But that's how he likes it. So how did it go, with your musician? He played me his music all night, and I can't even remember the tune. No false notes, I hope! No, quite the opposite! Well, then? I feel weird today, Margot. Like I'm coming out of my shell. Come with me. Like it? It's great. Right. I'm getting a drink. We have something in common with this piece. Really? What drew us both to it? It's astonishing. Have you noticed anything strange? - The hands? - Yes, the hands. They're huge, and masculine. They aren't protecting the child, they're holding it captive. The little girl is the prisoner of this kind of man-woman. We're always the prisoner of those who love us too much. Now, your hands... Not masculine at all! What a life-line. I foresee an important encounter. Really? Dinner? Oh, I see! - I like it. -Yes. When I was a kid, I was very solitary. And confused too, I guess. I used to play this strange game. I'd imagine I was in a park, beside a beautiful river. I'd slip into the water, and let myself drift away. I'd imagine all kinds of things. It was amazing, all the things I could see. I still play it, sometimes. You're so easy to talk to, Antoine. I like listening to you. I feel like I've known you for years. Don't you think so? Dreadful! But seriously, it's been ages since I had such a great evening. Thanks for everything. Good night. Good night, Joy. Well? Are you coming in, or going home? Thank you. Hello, my dear. So when are we meeting, Mom? Whenever you like, darling. How about next week? But I need to see you now. I'd love to, darling. But I'm so busy at the moment. You how it is with Jean-Albert. I have to organize everything. If you wanted to, you'd find time. Fine, I'll make space. Why don't we go for tea at Angelina's? I don't like the cakes there. What's with you this morning? It's like everything's bad in the world! Oh, Mom... You don't understand. Okay, take care. Talk to you later. - Bye. - Bye, Joy. - Hey. - Hi, Karine. Karine, check out my trick-shot. Wait a second. Now, look! Not bad! How's things? -Well... - Having fun? See you. Hi, Colette. These days, I only find inspiration underneath bridges. You know the drill, you little sluts. Yeah! Sounds fun! Go on, then. Nice and curly. O, beautiful garden, I long to spend my life breathing your perfumes, and proffering my hungry mouth to you. I long to slip my finger in, exploring your deepest mysteries. And within this flower, a new world opens up. What's up with Joy? Is she okay? I don't know. She won't stop dancing. A new, more beautiful universe, in-between your thighs... What is it, Joy? You're on another planet. I can't sleep over any more, Margot. ...descending upon me, a fear that I might pass through... Not that long ago, you were only too happy to stay. ...with my greedy sword... Hold out your glass. Just because I make love when I want to, it doesn't mean I'm a whore. My sexual liberty is conditional, it's under control. You're living in la-la land. Margot. I think I'm... Sounds like you're about to say something stupid. I'm in love. Here, have a drink. Is it your musician? I thought he'd put his saxophone away. No, someone else. A real man. Oh, well that's different! Tarzan and Jane? That's sad, really sad. And I don't even know where he lives. I've heard this all before. He gets horny for an evening, and you never see him again. Just forget him. I don't want to. You'll end up getting hurt. They're all the same. Don't believe it. They're not all so simple. And it's much more exciting when they're mysterious. That which cannot be understood... doesn't deserve to be learned. You know this won't do. There'll be waterproofing problems... you know the rest. The contractors will want to keep their costs down, and in the end, it'll cost the same. Same old story. - Can you get me the file? - Right away. Marc, your friend is here. She's waiting in your office. - And can you... - Thank you, Denise. In a minute. Finally! - ls your bike here? - Yes, why? Then I'll take the car. Have you got the keys? Alright, keep your hair on. I've been waiting for half an hour. Fine, fine. - Are we going out tonight? - I can't. It's the Elton John premiere. I have to write it up for tomorrow. Careful, I'll be checking. Do what you like. Can you get me the Ringaud office? Right away. Ringaud Enterprises on line two. Okay. Nice broad. I bet I can bring you a signed photo, tomorrow. You're on. Listen, can we talk downstairs? I'll be right there. Could I speak to Mr. Ringaud, please? It's Marc Charoux. It's Marc Charoux. So, tomorrow you should come straight to the agency, okay? Great. I can recommend Debbie, who's a similar type. You're fine with her? Great, I'll send her. - Joy, I have something to tell you. - Back in a second. I'll send her right over. Ah, Joy. Finally. Listen, I need an answer today, for that project. Where are they shooting? Last I heard, it was Africa. You can tell them no. I hate Africa. Too humid. That's a new one. - Sure you won't do it? - No. Sit down, you're pissing me off. I can't understand your whims. But still, I have another offer for you in Mexico. A little island off the Yucatan coast. It's a poster shoot for a new woman's magazine. Sound good? - I'll take it. - Good. Who's the photographer? Helmut Edison. He's from Lebanon, looking for something new. He's really starting to go places. Even better. Anything else, Joy? Yes. I need an advance. You're pushing your luck! That's the third time this month. Sorry, but I can't. Oh well, too bad. - Thanks all the same. - You're welcome. - You could just... - That's how it is. Sorry, I... It's crazy that you've signed it. It's cute! You like to be looked at, don't you? Showing your thighs, your private parts, thinking of all the men who you're giving a hard-on... it must turn you on. And you. You like to think of all those people watching, admit it. Yes, but for an exhibitionist like you... Oh, Marc. Let's not fight over nothing. We're so good together. With you, I feel... different. Oh, great. Here comes the romance. Don't you like it? You know what they say. There is no love, only proof of love. And love had to be earned. Anything you want. You're all the same. No, for you I'd do anything. Would you be my plaything? I already am your plaything. Really? How could you doubt it? Yes, Sir? Tell him what you were saying to me. You can whatever you wish with me. I'm your plaything, your whore. And I'll prove it to you. Check, please. Yes, Sir. Surprised? A little. Relax. This is a magnificent specimen. A vagina in the bloom of youth, right in the middle of blossoming. The lips are like opening petals, gaining their color. And now, gentlemen, we are about to have some fun. Start it up. Of course, Master, right away. One, two and three. Sound. Set everything running. Good. And now we can proceed, dear friends. It's ready. You seem worried. Isn't this what you wanted? Yes. But in fact... Sit down. And watch. You know, what must be accounted for is the chromatic variation, the texture of the flesh. Look, if you will, at this rose... this rose flowering in pink... Notice the trembling skin. As it's your initiation, the best part is reserved for you. You know, many of the women who come here are dishonest, creatures hungry for money, or simply... naive. They freeze up, when they reach the limits of bourgeois exhibitionism. This one doesn't fall into that category. Watch closely. Yes, and what is, in my opinion, her finest quality, is her insatiable desire to and be watched by others. You're quite right. Except that her purity is tainted by a second desire. She wants to be taken. Penetrated. Straddled. Let us retire, and let our able guest do his work. Go ahead. Your turn. Good. I'm your plaything. Fuck me. I've been offered a great job in Mexico. But I'm going to refuse it. I don't want to leave you, even for a few days. That's too bad, because I'm going to Montreal. Really? But you told me... It's for work. Then take me with you. Montreal suits me fine. No... I don't think so. Why does this guy get to me so much? Where are we going? That way. Look. - Look at that fresco! - The paintings? They're all gods. Come on. Come on in! What a hard life! It's just too much. I know, I can't take it any more! So when do we start work? As soon as the light's right. Lean back. - Let's go up there. There's a view. - Yes! - Are you scared of heights? - No! Let's do it, then. Race you. Since this morning, it seems my motives are getting mixed up. It's true, I want you. Really? But I keep thinking about another man. I miss him. Come on. Let's dance. Hello Joy, my darling. It's Alain. Just calling to see if you're back. I send you all my love. I'll call you. Joy, my love. I'm going out with David in half an hour. You should see him! He's so excited. Kisses. Hi, it's me. Marc. I'm in Toronto. Everything here is perfect. But I prefer Montreal. The girls are nicer. I'll call you when I'm back. See you soon. Lots of love. I'm thinking of you. What are you doing here? I sensed you were coming home. Come in, then. That's the part that joins onto the show-home. And there... That's the edge of the site. Let's take a look. - Do you like the color? - I love it! Quite something, isn't it? Have you seen these columns? Look at those marvelous trees. I love you, when you talk about your work. - What, only then? - No! I like that part. How about you? Yes. Joy, I have something important to tell you. It's not easy, but you need to know. It's been weighing on my mind. So, yeah. There's another woman in my life. Look at me. I don't want to lose you. I love you. I love you both. What are you talking about? You understand perfectly well. Don't make me choose. Why can't I just keep seeing you both? You're some businessman. You must think I'm really stupid. Go on. I'll go home on my own. Look. It's there, too! Orgasm: A woman's right They're everywhere. See? I'm good for something. Joy! What do you think of feminism? What about women's rights? They're everyone's rights. It's this way. In here. Ready, Remy? Going live in five seconds. Five, four, three... We're on. You'll all recognize this photo which has captivated France. It's all over the press. How do the professionals react? "The Price to Pay - Woman as the Enemy". It's become part of the national and international landscape. Here to talk with us on "Women In Our Time", is the woman at the center of the scandal... Joy Laurey. Let me ask you, Joy. How does it feel to be transformed, overnight, into a superstar? It's really surprising. I wasn't expecting this. And it's also a little scary, what with all the solicitations and potential pitfalls. I wondered what effect this campaign has had on your private life. None at all. I never had a private life to start with! The campaign is a disgrace. A disgrace, I tell you. Women are beginning to assert their independence in society, and now they bring back the woman as object. Unbelievable! I disagree. Joy's beautiful. She's allowed to show herself off. Beauty alone is revolutionary. I think it's scandalous that the television is paying such attention to an exhibitionist. There are much more interesting topics, like research. Joy Laurey, what do you say to that? They're all right. It just depends on your point of view. True, I make use of my body. People may despise that. But on the other hand, I'm only doing my job. You have no right to degrade the walls of our cities like this. It's prostitution. Personally, I quite like it. And so do my girlfriends! That's just what I like to hear! No, leave it! It was almost the end. Are you sure? I always knew my little girl would go far. I often said so to your mother. Didn't I, Emma? Here. To your health, gorgeous. To your success. Joy, I'm so proud of you. To both our efforts. All three of us. Thank you. That's not all, my dears. Wait till you see what I've made for dinner. Let's have some music. I want to cradle you. And touch you, like yesterday. I want to be more than your stepfather. What are you two doing? You little minx. Go to your room! But Mom, it wasn't me. Go on. You're so beautiful. - Can I ask you something, Mom? - Of course, darling. Where did you put my childhood photos? Photos? It would be fun to see them again. And the ones of my father. Your father? You shouldn't see them. Yes. I want to. Please, Joy, forget all that. Anyway, I'm not even sure where I put them. Would you recognize him if you saw him today? Of course. Why do you ask? Would you get back with him? No, Joy. You still love him. Just give it a rest, please. Smells great! The anti-sexist law, which stirred up such controversy last month, is, according to the Women's Rights Office, an act that will allow them to defend their rights... You're so sweet. What is it? Sautéed veal, with lardons. It's like you've cooked it your whole life. Who taught you? Mother. Who else? She's the best cook in the West. How about some paprika? Sorry, I forgot the corkscrew. And now, you will all be familiar with France's current hot topic. Arnaud Duvd-Bousset, the centrist deputy of Cawados, has submitted an open question to the Bureau of the Assembly, asking the Attorney General if this photo may be an infringement of the law passed in May 1952, regarding the protection of minors. Naturally, the Attorney made a statement to representatives, and I remind you... There are bigger problems in the world. No, leave it on. You never told me you knew her. Yes, I do. I must have met her at some gallery or other. My paper's asked me to go and interview her. Really. - But why? - Why. What? The interview. She's all anyone's talking about! That's my point. This is my job, Marc, so it's my business. Fine. Let's drop it. But I warn you, I know what she's like, and... she likes to make things up. I get the impression you're out to prove something. I think you're right. Yes, I must be trying to prove something to myself, to test my limits. Why did you want to meet here? This place speaks to me. It makes me look inward. Look! Isn't that tree beautiful? Tell me about yourself. Sure, why not? My fantasies and fears, my darker side, men... But no, your paper doesn't do that stuff. Let's go back to your career. Do you also sing, and dance? I'm learning. But you've got exciting plans. I read that you were going to the States, to do a big TV series. Things are working out. You're becoming a star. I've only done a few screen tests in Paris, but I'm hopeful. You know, I think we have a mutual friend. Marc Charoux. How funny! Have you known him long? Yes, we're really old friends. I love this purple beech so much, it's crazy. That's the tree's name! Joy! Is your phone out of order? Yes. We been trying to call you for days. - You know what's happened? - Non. The screen tests you did for those damned Americans. - Yes. - What do you mean, "Yes"? - You got through! - So when do I leave? Two days ago. I've had New York on the line at 3am, asking what's going on. I'm as good as there. - I'm waiting for you. - Thanks. I'll be there soon. Here's to your success. Merci, Monsieur Miller. They can't wait to meet you, at the studio. Come in! Wait, hang on. "Greetings from Paris, and welcome to New York. Marc." Johnny, are you okay? I'm sorry. What's gotten into you, Joy? Why hit him so hard? That stunt man's costing me a fortune. I'm in training. Want a demonstration? I can't, now. Let me introduce one of my best friends. This guy is absolutely great. - Now, George... - No, it's true. He's a scientist, but he knows everything about everything. We write scripts together. And at the moment, he's fascinated by esotericism. Honored to meet you. The pleasure's mine. You have some marvelous objects. You could say each one of them represents a certain stage of my life. Have a seat. Can I get you a coffee, or a fruit juice? Fruit juice would be great. Thanks. People give her so many different names. What do you call her? Durga. In India, they also call her Chakti. She's waking up, today. Have you heard about the American movement, known as... The New Age? I've read a few articles on it. Our rationalist friends call us "Aquarian Conspirators". But we'd rather be known as something like... "Architects of the Future". We must strive to free the metamorphic energy, which lies dormant in the heart of every one of us. But I'm probably boring you. No, not at all. Is this your first time in New York? - Yes, it's my other homeland. - How's that? My father was American. "Was"? He was tall, and handsome. When he left, I didn't want to believe it. I'd tell myself that one day, as I came out of the schoolyard, he'd be there. Cowboy hat, smoking a cigarette, blue eyes, tanned, behind the wheel of a green Cadillac. And he would take me far away. The love of my life is a ghost. And you never tried to find him? How do you find a ghost? What's that picture of? Oh, that! This is Man's inner pyramid. Each color represents an energy. Here, it's flattened out into four separate triangles. And it's our job to lift it into its... vertical position. And that's the Age of Aquarius. Come in! Put it over there. I'm in Paris, missing you terribly. Come home soon. Marc. You're exactly what they're looking for. Goldman's agreed to a new contract, and I even got him to double your fee. That's great, George. Thanks. Like I said, "With George Miller it's never a problem". Success guaranteed. With a five per cent cut. Sure. If you think you're on the right track, then go for it. Find out everything you can. No, I told you. It's for a friend. Yeah. Let me know as soon as possible. Fine. I'm counting on you. Thanks. Bye. I've got to find her father. You know what? I spend a lot of my time... with a group who are reviving an ancient tradition. What tradition? Have you heard of Tantric Yoga? Tantric Yoga? Yes, of course. - Tell me... -Would you...? - Would you like to find out more? - Yes! Now! You see? They're going to become lovers. They have chosen each other, and abstained for over a year. Why make that choice? Because for them, sex is a journey toward the divine. That is, towards ourselves. Through voluntary chastity, they've built up energies which, now they're being released, will transport them. And then, they will become one. They're beautiful. I felt something strange, last night. A kind of well-being. I felt it too. Wait there. You're a photographer, too? Not really. But I'd love to be, one day. I'm scared to go back to Paris. You had an easy life there. The life of a beautiful girl who always succeeds, unable to resist pleasure. But maybe you're beginning to discover another self within you. You're afraid. Don't let yourself succumb to these terrible energies, which haunt us all. Learn to use them. Believe in yourself, Joy. You're strong. Much stronger than you realize. Yes! Push the door! Darling. It's so good to see you again. Come with me. Here's to your return. Did you have many men? How about you? Many women? - Every night. - Me too. Slut! I've been working too hard, lately. I'm thinking of taking a holiday. Marc, I've just got here. What's with the bags? Are you planning on staying? Sorry, but my mom took the apartment keys, and I lent mine to a friend. Margot's not home. I had no one left. If I'm bothering you, I can always go to a hotel. Of course you can stay. You're amazing. You're the most beautiful girl I've had in my life. Listen to this. "He who witnesses Absolute Love without experiencing it, "is condemned to unhappiness, "forever after." That's nice, but I'm in the middle of an interesting article. Come here. I mean it. It should be like this all the time. Do you really want to have some fun? I'll take you to one of my favorite spots. Sound good? Sure. Marc. Je t'aime. Moi non plus. It's spooky here. Where are you taking me? Into the old petrol tanks of the service station. It's weird. You'll see. It's always a shock, the first time. Want a drink? It'll do you good. So, here we are. This is the Temple of Woman. Men are only allowed in, in order to fulfill your fantasies. You can do whatever you want. Make the most of it. Hey, careful. Be nice. She's going to come again. Look. - I've had enough. - Wait. I can't take any more. You're staying. I want to watch these guys fuck you. Get it? Please, be gentle. You can see how weak she is. Move. Go on, lick it. Okay, Joy? Why, Marc? I love you. Telegram for Mr. Charoux. Here. - Sorry. - It's okay. Goodbye. Marc, my darling. I'm coming home tomorrow, as planned. Kisses, Joelle. What's up with you? Well, Marc, I've achieved all my fantasies. Now, I want to move onto something else. To yet another man? I'm just a slut to you, aren't I? Isn't that enough? What else can I see in you? Oh, right. So what do you see in her? What's this? You wanted to keep both of us. The mother, and the whore. But you're going to end up all alone. But you came back to me. I know what I want in life. But you're just chasing around, looking for a man who doesn't exist. I had to come back to understand everything. I truly loved you. You could have done whatever you wanted with me. But I believed that underneath it all, you wanted more than just to watch other men fuck me. But that's your life. Stupid bastard! Let's get something clear - it's over. You don't deserve me. I'm so glad I can help you, Joy. Thanks, David. I had no idea you still lived with your mother. He's not so dumb! It's a good excuse for him to come and live at my place. So you left Marc, just like that? No more passionate embraces? No. But I realized that you can see things in black and white. And with Marc, it was only ever black. Come in. Who's that? That's Abe. He's been there since 1945. - Really? - Follow me, it's upstairs. I'll leave you to it, I have to phone someone. - We're under the eaves! - Yeah. Something wrong? No, it's okay. Make yourself at home. Thanks, David. I feel bad, putting you out like this. Margot's right. You shouldn't go near the wall. They're leaking, and there's a kind of strange smell. That's why I put sheets over them. It's great to hear your voice. You're hard to get hold of. A lot's changing in my life, at the moment. You know, I've decided something. I'm coming back to New York. That's where I need to be. Well now, you have one more reason to come back. Yes? What's that? I have someone with me. Ever since I mentioned you to him, he only wants one thing. To see you! What's this about? Hold on. I'll pass you over. Bruce met with me, to tam about you. He explained to me who you are. It's true. I really want to see you. But who are you? I'm... I'm quite emotional. I'll pass you back to Bruce. What's going on? Listen, it's quite simple. I thought about everything you'd told me, and I did some research. You just spoke to your father. Are you listening? Now departing for New York, Flight 115. Immediate boarding in Terminal 3.
