And then there was cocaine. It was white. It had a sweet sort of scent to it. Very soft. It was the most innocent looking one of them all. Innocent. Like Joe used to be. Sure he got into a little trouble, but what teenager doesn't? Then things got bad. He dropped out of school, he couldn't keep a job, it was always someone else's fault, never Joey's. And he was moody and angry, arguing with everybody. He was different. The drug changed him.

Marianna, as you can guess, I am planning to spend a little more time near the home fires. [muffled speech] I need someone in New York to supervise distribution. Someone with your style, with your attitude, with your sense of business. Marianna... ...if you let me... ...I can make you a very wealthy woman. Now, before you offer me any more protestations, let me tell you a story. I was listening to one of those talk shows, and there was a psychologist from Tufts University. He was saying if we start a monkey on cocaine, and then we take it away from him... ...there is a good chance that monkey will kill himself trying to get it. Now, the monkey doesn't have any money, and not too much brains, but I think you understand my illustration. Marianna, I speak to De Salles yesterday. Henri and I are inviting you into a once a customer, always a customer, business. A sure thing. A forever market. Everybody want a piece of the Holy Grail, Marianna, and that is what we are selling. Sweet cocaine. It sparkle... ...like snow on a winter morning. In one instant... ...it make the whole world... ...wonderful. [sniffing] He's got 25 kilos for her. She told him that she regarded it as an important career move, and she wanted time to think it over. Yeah, how'd you know that? I'm a magnificent guesser. I told her to go ahead and take the deal. You said what? I said I told her to go ahead and take the deal. It is a great price! 29 grand a pop, I mean, where you gonna find a price like that? That's a real bargain price. Did we or did we not go through this very thing once before? Or is my brain on vacation? She's carrying it for 30 days, full credit. That'll give us 30 days to come up with a good, solid arrest warrant. We can start now with Henri De Salles. - Henri De Salles? - Yeah. It's 1025 Humboldt Avenue, Miami. Fosh calls him "the father of us all." He'll pick the stuff up today or tomorrow. As soon as they call him. We might be able to get one of our own people in on the big event. And if not? I'll need 12 cars and 30 men. How much is 25 kilos of cocaine worth? About $700,000. No, no, on the street. $12 million, give or take a buck. Yeah, $12 million.
