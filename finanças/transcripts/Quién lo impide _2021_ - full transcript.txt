- Hello. - Hey, Candela... how are you? Good, how are you? Good, hanging in there, how's it going in Madrid? - Pretty busy with stuff... but good. - How's life? Wow, it's been so long. - Yeah, it's great to see you. - And you. Wow, Javi, Marta... - Hello. - Hello. - Hello, guys. - Hi. - Hi. - It's been so long! - Hi. - How are you? - How's it going? - I'm busy with exams, but otherwise good. Not much of a plan. How are you guys? Joni. - How are you? - How are you? - Good, it's been so long. - How are you? It's great to see you, even like this. I wanted to give you some good news: the film is ready. Wow. - At last! - It was about time! You're right. Five years, mate. - Christ. - Five years already? Almost five years. - Almost. - That's insane. - Sure. - I started when I was 15. How old are you now? Nineteen... Almost twenty. - That's crazy. - A lot has happened since then. Shit. A real lot has happened. Jon√°s, how long is it? Good question. It lasts three and a half hours. - Fucking hell! - No shit! - Three hours? - No way! - No more, no less. - What about the people? Well, you already know, it's an immersive experience, people... Properly immersive... - You have to trust people. - A deep experience. Exactly, you have to trust. The good thing is... we've done two intervals, it's three and a half hours, but there are two intervals, so it has three parts with two intervals. For people to rethink their lives. - Absolutely. - Reflect on the film, what's happening. - The moment of truth. - Go to the toilet... - Let it all sink in. - Reflect, absolutely. All right then, if you want, why don't we watch it and see what you think? - Cool. - Let's get started! - Watching ourselves is embarrassing. - I can't wait! Right, then... WHO'S STOPPING US It's not so much about feeling as though you're acting it's more about making it as true to your own lives as you can. What we're interested in here is you, not a fictitious character or anything. You know? Let's give it a try, okay? We'll give you a couple of minutes, go and find your own spot in pairs. Candela and Pablo will stay here to start with, okay? And the rest of you... As you wish. I'll give you some help. You two get together here. Lift me up, Pablo. - It's downhill and really uncomfortable. - Christ, you'll kill me. AUTUMN 2016 FIRST MEETING Just good friends I think, because if we start saying that one person liked the other and the other person asked the other one out, it will be a bit confusing because that isn't the cause of the conflict. Yeah, you're right. Okay, the story is that I got on well with you, and you started hanging out with others and I got angry, so I kind of couldn't care less about you and then you come along and say, "What's wrong?" And I say, "Well, you know..." And you and your mates laugh at me. Yeah, kind of, you saw us laughing at you in the corridor and I tell you we weren't laughing at you, you know? We were looking at you but not laughing at you. - I was your best friend. - Yeah, my friend and then... 'Cos I knew you lied and you were a kind of... - An asshole. - Yeah. Then we were together and the vegan thing cropped up. How do we bring that in? We were good friends - even though I was a lying bastard. - No... And then I... No, you were vegan, it's more convincing. I don't look much of a vegan. So, you were vegetarian, let's not say vegan... - Okay. - And so... I start reproaching you saying, "That's a waste of time." "You're a..." And then you reproach me for being a liar. - Okay. - And... You'd never treated me bad even though I was an asshole. - Okay. - And that's about it. We leave it at that and that's when we go to mediation. - Okay. - I make you go to mediation. - You're violent! - Okay, that's fine. Right then, you explain it, see if you've got the gist of it. - I'm the vegan. - Yes. You're my friend but we'd been going out together, or not? - Yeah, it sounds convincing. - Okay. And then... So, you criticise me for being vegetarian and I start saying I'd been with you even though you were a liar and you did things I didn't kind of like. And we go to mediation because of the conflict that arises. Okay, sorted. We'll wait for the rest to finish. The mediation scene. It has to be a sharp clap. - Like this. - You do it. Yes, that's better. A bit higher. There. - When you're ready. - Do it. Right, then... Take it easy, when you're ready. Okay. Hi, guys, we're here because there's been a problem that we don't know about. Well, introductions first: I'm Candela. I'm Pablo. We're here to help you. So, can you tell us who you are and why you're here? You can start if you like. Well, I'd like to point out that... I remember when I used to see her and she was happy, it made my day because she was positive. I mean, she transmitted her positivism. If I was down, she cheered me up. But ever since what happened with that other lad, it got worse every time I saw her, it was the complete opposite, she transmitted her negative attitude and I've ended up drifting apart because I couldn't stand it. I think part of the problem has been a lack of understanding, you know? If we said how we feel when we do things, we'd understand one another and get on better. From that day when she says I stopped talking to her, she started to ignore me. We used to get on well but suddenly, from then on... Nothing. - Okay. - How did you feel? You're the one who criticises me with your friends. You what? I didn't know why she'd started to ignore me. So, if I don't know why she ignores me, why should I be the one to go to her? She should do her bit, that's what she said before. What was the situation like before for you, Lucia? Well, it was different. I mean, we'd go out together every day and tell each other everything and then suddenly he preferred doing it with someone else. Right. I didn't mention: we went out together. And when she was my girlfriend I didn't say a thing about her being a vegetarian. It didn't really bother me. And now... I didn't really know... I knew but it kind of surprised me a bit. It came up in conversation, we talked it over, I stated my opinion and at some point she started saying things about me that were irrelevant and that weren't even true: saying I was a liar, which I'm not. Saying I did my own thing. I was stating my opinion as to why I didn't agree and she started going on about things which I felt were a bit disrespectful. - So, obviously... - Claudia, listen to him. So, at that point I thought: rather than losing our friendship, let's try and sort things out. Oil... Palm oil, salt, chilli, onion, garlic, soya sauce... - Let's see... - Hang on, what did you say first? Which? Monosodium glutamate? Those are headache pills. They sell them at the chemist, blue pills. Why do they put it in this, man? No idea. It's gonna be real tasty. NEVER HAVE I EVER... THE TYPICAL WEEKEND YOUR PARENTS GO TO THEIR COUNTRY HOUSE AND YOU INVITE YOUR FRIENDS TO SLEEP OVER ...nutritional value per 110 grams: calories: 523. - What are you doing? - Substance. I bet you two euros they don't even realise. If they realise, I'll laugh my head off. Christ... Christ, mate. Can you swap hands? I won't look. - What's the point? - I don't know. I'll catch it. You'll catch it? - Wait, wait. - You can reach, there we go! Right. Right, there's a ball and a basket. You throw the ball into the basket. Watch this. Look at this. Claudia, help me! Go on. Teamwork. Right, this is how you do it. I'm going to score from here. - Go for it. - Impressive. Claudia... for Christ's sake. I'll leave you to it. What do you bet I win? - Our virginity. - Our virginity? - Stop it. - No! Just let me get the ball, please. Okay. - Are you tired? - I'm a bit tired. - Are you tired? - I'll have a quick nap later. Yeah. We'll have sex after, right? You're an idiot, mate. You're a ball hogger. Really, life is like a song Some sing it better and others worse We're just fictional characters With my mouth I can say lots of things But my eyes can say more If you know Look at me and you'll hear And if you want to enjoy yourself I know a place It's by the sea, it's great Christ, why not? When I'm by your side... You've been messing around all this time, and now this? I'm a dickhead. You're not a dickhead. You, weak mortal, you're doomed to the unicycle for the rest of your days. Come here. I'm alright over here. Please. You'll miss your chance. I didn't intend sleeping over. Seriously? Shit! - It's your turn, by the way. - What? It's your turn. Never have I ever... read a book out of obligation and enjoyed it. Okay, it's a bit crap but... But it's happened a lot, it was compulsory reading and I ended up, "Shit, I like it!" - Yes, that happens. - Pass it on to Alberto. With the April Theses by Lenin, man. That god damn baldy. Do you read? Can you read? - Never have I ever really bullied anyone. - Shit. - Me neither. - Asshole. No, it was a joke, a couple of jokes. "It was a joke, we pulled down his pants and sodomised him, ha ha ha." I bullied a kid, but by accident, it was crazy, he was bullying me and I got him back, and I was like, shit, I'm going too far. Never have I ever been to a teen disco. I haven't. - She's drinking. - How embarrassing. Never mind, everyone... - Have you been to Kapi? - No. Come on... Everyone has the right to make a mistake. Or not. It's your turn. Okay. Never have I ever walked down the street naked. Does a beach count? - No, there are lots of nudist beaches. - I wouldn't round here, you know? Because of the cops. Otherwise... - What? - Yeah, right... - If it weren't for the cops, I'd go naked. - That'd be cool. Hey, it would be cool. - You've gone cross-eyed. - Yeah, sure. Never have I ever... cut my hand on purpose, like a satanic ritual from an '80s horror film, kind of, slash! - Kind of emo? - Kind of emo. - I've tried but it's impossible. - The Crown, Heath Ledger style. Why have you tried? To be more emo? Like, I'm really depressed. - The shit knife doesn't cut. - I wanted to have a scar, but no luck. I bet! Emos... Science. Your turn, Gavira. I've got a good one. Never have I ever been attracted to anyone here. Stirring things up. Look at that. Right, my turn. Never have I ever... beaten anyone up. Fucking hell. I've felt like it, but... I haven't. Just a kick in the bollocks and they're crying. - That's not beating someone up. - Yeah, but... What are we on about? Where am I? It's Alberto's turn. - My turn? - Yeah. Fuck, I can't think of anything. Go to the blackboard and pull your pants down. Vaseline, lots of Vaseline. - Whose turn is it? - It's your turn, mate. It's my turn. Well, there you go. This... this... this... and this. But it's kind of a cool step like... Wait. It was kind of... That's it, cool. Cool! Hang on. - And then the chorus... - Hang on, see if I can do it. That's it. What's up, Pablo? Sloshed on vodka? Suck my cock. The sea is vast, like your heart And the waves are fierce Like the passion I feel When I'm next to you Claudia, I'm off. - Are you going? - I'll call you later, okay? If you're fifteen years old And you intend to escape Then you have all you need to do it You could leave before the city lights Switch off forever beyond remedy You could change your name For another that sounds better Stamp out your lineage once and for all You could jot down in your notebook A new code of honour But always in poetry, never in prose Who's stopping you? Who's stopping you? Who's stopping you? Nobody's stopping you Who's stopping you? Who's stopping you? Who's stopping you? Nobody's stopping you You could take the path That's furthest from the hard shoulder The one taken by those with no regrets You'll be able to see in things Things you couldn't see before And even awake You'll be a man who sleeps The seasons will pass And you'll forget to speak You'll even forget your own memory I didn't get much sleep, but I slept well. Well, I'll not ask. - I'm going for a lie down now. - Okay. - Will you wake me up? - Sure, don't worry. - See you. - See you. Stamp out your lineage once and for all. You could jot down in your notebook a new code of honour. I'M A STUDENT NOT A PUPPET - State... Schools. - State... Schools. State... Schools. FOR STATE SCHOOLING NO TO PRIVATISATION If we're the future, why are they fucking us over? If we're the future, why are they fucking us over? PROTEST FOR THE ABOLITION OF REASSESSMENTS THE REPEAL OF THE EDUCATIONAL REFORM AND THE REVERSAL OF CUTBACKS 26TH OCTOBER 2016 From north to south... from east to west, we'll keep fighting for what's best. - Fucking Educational Reform. - Fucking Educational Reform. Fucking Educational Reform. No way, no way... we don't want to pay your debts, with health and education. No way, no way... we don't want to pay your debts, with health and education. They made a big effort to bring in the final-exam system, but when it comes to improving education, the syllabus and organising how to make lessons better and more enjoyable, they don't get involved. The final-exam system is really unfair because if you have to do an exam and you feel ill, then what? All the effort you've made during secondary school is no use. Their aim is for us to learn less and less and for us to be less open-minded, so we think less. That's why they eliminate Philosophy, a subject which really opens your mind and makes you think. Because in the end, they'll manipulate us more easily in the future. If we all follow like sheep, we'll do as they say and that's it. I think there's a problem with people dropping out of school and nothing is being done about it. With regards to the education system, Spain is one of the countries where most time is dedicated to studying. Young kids are shut away in their rooms studying instead of playing, which is what they should be doing as kids. We dedicate so many hours and then it's the country with the least prospects. We're studying for nothing. All that time spent is wasted. These days, there's a growing trend of complaining about everything, and blaming others for doing things wrong. People don't think about what they can do themselves, they just blame the politicians... Have you thought about what you can do? If you were a politician, maybe it's not that easy. I'm not saying they're doing a good job but people tend to complain, "These do such and such, I'll complain." "They do it differently and I complain..." Why? Because it's the in thing. I don't fully agree, some people complain just for the sake of it because it's true, it's a growing trend, with today's moralists... But there are no signs of any effort. In recordings of the Spanish Parliament there are people asleep. It's like a first-year secondary school lesson. I mean, I find it intolerable. If they are really trying hard and things don't work out, perhaps things are failing and it isn't really their fault. What I see in today's society is that politics is handed down to you, it's hereditary. If your dad is right wing, you are, if you like mum better and she's left wing, you're left wing. And I come from a lineage of extreme left wingers, the most extreme left or whatever. So obviously, I can't even dream of voting a conservative, because that's kind of the devil. I often think, "What if the truth lies in being conservative?" But I soon forget that idea. What if the conservatives are the good guys and I've inherited being a shit left winger? It's something we don't stop to think about. My family, all of them... for example, my grandmother is a Falangist, my mother is a moderate right-winger, but she's still a right-winger, she was raised a right-winger and she embraced those ideologies, and... even so, I find myself asking why does everything have to be how they say it is and how they've hammered it into me? My mum has told me over and over that I'm to think for myself, that I don't have to share her beliefs, so I can dare to go against her. It happens with everything, you get to a point in life where your parents have shown you all of the paths and you must begin to choose your own, you can't hang on to everything that other people say, and you start becoming independent, so to speak, with your rules, your character, your ideologies... SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS Carmen's idea about the lack of free t¬°me, the idea that we have to be studying all the time, children hardly have time to play and our performance is poor and such... If we could switch to that idea, not being afraid to talk about pleasure. I often get frustrated, I have lots of homework most days and at 9 p.m. it's dinner and bed, when I would have liked to have done some drawing on the computer or whatever. But I can't. Or play the piano... I like drawing, playing the piano and singing etc. But I never have time, I have to do other things. And it's like... I'd be more productive in things I like but I can't do them. Or sometimes, for example, when I'm doing things I want, I've got homework at the back of my mind and I can't concentrate properly on what I really like doing because it's like at the back of my mind, "You're not studying, you're wasting time, you're going to fail." So, I can't even relax and do the things I enjoy. Also, for example, I'd like to spend my free time doing music or learning new things, but you have to dedicate the whole time to studying. You end up seeing studying as something bad. It doesn't leave you any time to do things you like. Every time I have to study, I see it as something negative rather than something that should be positive for learning. Like she said, when it comes to hobbies or spending time at home on your own, drawing or listening to music... It's like teenagers are always in groups and with friends all the time, but we also like... Well, at least I do... I like being on my own doing my own thing. Yes, the insecurity we all feel at certain times, "I'm not as good, so-and-so is better..." - Feeling inferior? - Yes. How could we represent that kind of insecurity? It's really interesting but it's difficult. How would you represent that moment when you feel inferior? It isn't physical loneliness, for example, someone sitting on their own in class. It's more in private: when you're on your own and you think, "I'm different," but you aren't, really, you just don't mention it and others probably feel just the same. And what you said before about loneliness, what happens when people can't see you. It's also the fear of not being accepted like the example mentioned before about when there's a new girl in class, that's how she feels too. But it's not just that, though you're in a group and you don't feel lonely it's like, you're going to buy something and you wonder, "What will people think?" Whether you're on your own or not there's always that insecurity of not being accepted. I think it's important to see that too. What am I going to do with my life? What am I going to do with my life? What am I going to do with my life? What am I going to do with my life? I've really... no idea. What job will I have? TIMES OF LONELINESS I think about love It's such a lovely feeling. And thoughts of a sinister nature like death. What will happen after all this? Will I ever be able to see my dad again? Or will nothing happen at all? Will everything just come to an end, without a word to him? When I'm with my friends, I don't usually think much, I go with the flow. But when I come to my room... it's amazing... the amount of things I think about. I'll do it again. Don't worry if you get it wrong and do it again, it'll be nice to have it. Months had passed since Pablo had drifted apart from his friends. He met up with them but he didn't really take part in their jokes or usual games. They'd wander along the Majadahonda high street to the shopping centre where they'd have a drink and chat... unless they'd gone bowling or to the cinema. They told anecdotes from class, criticised certain teachers, shared stories on Instagram or... discussed their first girlfriends. They'd started going out with girls and some of them were already hooking up. But not Pablo. Pablo just sat there listening to everything as if it had nothing to do with him. Pablo limited himself to just being there, it's the way he was, you know? Well, he'd listen to everything but as if it had nothing to do with him, and perhaps that ended up pissing the others off, it's normal. What's Pablo's real problem? I think it's that he doesn't know what his problem is. It as though he feels lonelier when he is with people and with his friends than when he is actually alone. We were in PE class, running laps around the court, that guy there is me, running in the opposite direction. And I think it was Arribas, the other Pablo, Pablo Arribas, well, he tripped him up, he did it half serious, half as a joke... Hoyos got pissed off and started pushing him, the teacher hadn't seen that he'd been tripped up and he sent Hoyos to sit on the bench, it was all very sad. Well, Pablo said that the gym teacher already had it in for him. He told me he had accidentally hit him with a ball in another class and the rest of the class had laughed at the teacher, and he'd had it in for him since then, but I don't know, to be honest. Hoyos always had a sort of contained rage, it's something his parents mentioned to us on more than one occasion, there were loads of arguments at home, slamming doors, locking himself in his room for hours, and completely ignoring them for days at a time. I wasn't surprised Hoyos ended up hitting Arribas that day... I'd say I'm almost glad it happened. I think that was the day I started to like him. Hey, what's going on here? I've got cramp in my calf muscle. What's going on, Pablo? - You dickhead. - Don't call him names. He's gone off his head, man. Right, Pablo, to the headmaster's office. That's enough. Carry on playing, I'll be back in five minutes. Get running, everyone. Move it. I said already I didn't do anything. I just went like that, but it was a joke. I was laughing. He only tripped him up, it's no big deal. Pablo looked really angry and suddenly smashed into him, and if the mat hadn't been there, and instead of pushing he'd... There's all of us gossiping: Aitana, Javi, Jorge, Claudia. That's me there, that's crazy... He never goes out, never says a thing, - and he gets good results... - Why didn't he take the other lad too? Where are you going? - Well, I don't get it you know... - Me neither. I mean I think you just have to go against the tide, because I see people who are doing things they don't want to do and you can see that they aren't happy. There are so few people that really look like they're actually happy, I don't know, people that are making the most out of everything or are at least trying to... I don't know, that's quite rare though. For me this stage is a bit like a black hole, I mean, okay, perhaps you're happy, and you're the only one who is, and there'll be happy occasions, but I don't know, perhaps it's the hormones, scientists say all sorts of stuff, but it's exhausting, it's really tiring, it's like what people always say about teenagers, those insecurities and all of that stuff, it'll always be there... You've experienced it too, haven't you? Yes, I feel I'm still a teenager. Awesome! ...and it's exhausting because there's so much going on in your head and you can never take a break or switch off - and so it real tires you out. - I don't think we'll ever switch off. I mean, I think we're always going to be like that, so if you don't find a moment to be happy... Of course, but I think there are times that you get stuck in this hole, and it's like that for people we know, isn't it? It's like a vicious circle, you don't want to feel bad, but you sort of like it at the same time. I don't reckon there's only one truth, One certainty... I don't know. Even the simplest of things, I could say my name's Javier S√°nchez but someone else could call me something else, I've loads of nicknames and stuff like that, and each of us has our own reality, so to speak, but I don't know, I'm not really sure about the idea of certainties. Just out of curiosity, I've noticed your hair is different colours, but even your beard... My beard, nails, even my shoes and shirt. Yeah, I got the feeling there was something split about you. - Yes, split in two. - And why is that? Well, let's see, it all started because my mum wouldn't let me dye my hair, so I thought, "I'll meet you half way," and I only dyed half of it. And this triggered a series of other stuff... So, now I don't shave this side of my beard. I don't paint all of my nails, only the ones on my left hand, and it's like I developed two personalities. I'm one person, but this side is one part of me and this is another. I really like writing and I also play instruments, my thinking and methodical side does the technical stuff, and the other side of me provides the inspiration, the side that makes me start playing an instrument or grab a pen to write, I don't know, perhaps it's a bit odd, but in reality, I'm the same person, I just like being like this. I'm homosexual and because I'm gay they're always labelling me, and a girl I don't even know was like, "I have a gay friend, you could hook up with him," or "do you like shopping?" I don't like those things, I'm gay and that's that. I like playing football, watching football, playing music, hanging out with my mates... I mean, just because you are or aren't whatever, homosexual... who cares, a woman... I mean every person is who they are, but society tends to lump people together because of what you are, and it's not just people our age that do it, older people do it too. I can see you wanted to get that out, didn't you? Yeah, I feel much better now. - Do you feel a bit pissed off? - Yes, big style. She is a chav and I'm a freak. He's a freak and I'm normal, I'm not a chav. - Well, I mean... - I'm not a chav. A chav, well... I'm not a chav, I mean, why? And why am I a freak? I mean... Because you like manga and all of that stuff. - Yeah, but... - You admit it. Yes, I guess I do... but because... I mean... Shit, I get nervous. Then if you make friends and you get it wrong... things like that. Because that happened to me, and the worst thing is that I still meet up with those guys and I think, "What am I doing with my life?" Am I a masochist or something? I know I have to do something, but it's as if I daren't do it. You're with people you don't want to be with, but yet you stay. Why do you think that is? Are you hooked on these people? No, I think, more than anything, it's not wanting to be alone, because I often think, "What if they're the only guys I can talk to," "The only ones I can meet up with?" So, there's a kind of uncertainty that I sometimes feel. I mean, I know I should stop spending time with these people but I don't know why I don't. Are you scared of solitude? Of being alone? Yeah, you could say that. And my current classmates have changed a lot of things for me, I consider them good friends because... I don't know, I feel like they helped me out whenever I needed it and I'm really glad I came and got to know them. This has been more recently, right? Yes, this is more recent, I also had my share of problems, bullying and that sort of stuff. They used to call me fat and things like that during or after class. The head of studies had to get involved, and they managed to nip the problem in the bud. Who'd have thought? I now have a good relationship with those guys, because they were very sorry about what they'd done, and, well, there are times when you just have to know how to forgive. I agree about the bullying thing. I mean, I didn't know these people, and my case was different to hers, she was quite lucky, no-one intervened in my case, of course, I moved on, and they also moved on but in a bad way. The only thing I could do was stay quiet, but now, over time... sorry. This affected you, didn't it? - Sorry. - No, not at all. And over the years I've been quite scared to get to know people and I've found it really hard to be able to trust people. I mean, for three years it was one thing after the other, and over those three years, I was alone. I mean, I only had my mother for support. I was really scared when I got here, because I thought, "What if the same thing happens again?" But of course I ended up meeting great people here and I've been able to try to forget my past, although it will always be there, but life is there to be enjoyed, so we just have to let things happen without them affecting us as much. We just have to deal with it ourselves and push ahead. I'm sorry, I didn't mean for you to tell me something so difficult. No, I'm sorry. No, but if you can share things and explain things from a distance, well, it's good to do that, even if it brings tears to your eyes because obviously it must have been really fucking hard. I see you've got to know each other and this has brought you closer, it's something you've been able to talk about. Yes, we've talked a lot about... our highs and lows. Really, in such a short time it has been amazing. I was speaking to a teacher yesterday who told me that when you go out for a walk you get to a point in which the two hemispheres of the brain activate at the same time, and that's quite good for you. WINTER SOLSTICE - Hello. - Hello. How are you? Good. What are you doing here? - Watching the fireworks. - Yeah... On the day of the solstice, I wanted to go out to see what the atmosphere was like and watch the fireworks, and it was there that I ran into Candela. Well, she actually ran into me because I was a bit lost out there. I find it hard to approach people and she came over to say hi to me with a friend. We don't really know each other that well, but we met in the mediation group and she actually helps us a lot. She gets people to open up and I learn a lot from her. So I'm glad to have her around during the mediation sessions. What's she like? Julia. What's she like? I don't know much about her. I just know she's new. - She's new? - Yes. It says that you and Julia have had an argument. Yes. So, you don't know her, but you insult one another? Sort of. She's new at this school, you see each other and start shouting abuse. No, it wasn't like that. How, then? I tried to help her to fit in, but I guess it didn't work... and here we are. - You tried to help her to fit in? - Yes. Why? Because... it isn't easy being the new girl, no one talks to you, everyone ignores you. How do you know? Because I've been a new girl. And... I've felt the same as she feels. Right, okay. So then, Julia arrives and you want to help her so she doesn't suffer like you did. Yes. So what happened to cause an argument and you end up here? A third person comes onto the scene... and it led to rejection. - I'm going to my lesson. - Okay. - I'll leave you to it. Bye. - Bye. Tell us a bit about that third person. - We don't get it. - Me neither. How...? So, she's new at school, you try to help her fit in, a third person turns up... - And rejection. - Rejection of what? Rejection of that third person? Or... We don't get it. Well, I didn't want to... I didn't want to be with that person. I didn't... I'd been betrayed. I couldn't be with someone who'd betrayed me and act as though nothing had happened. I felt I'd been let down. So... that was the end of it. This is what we'll do... We'll dismiss any idea like the relationship will never be the same, I won't get anything out of this, okay? Leaving all that behind, which could be a possibility. I want you to take the tools that we are offering you, to come to mediation along with Julia, and you ask her everything you want to ask her, you explain to her everything you want, and try to clear up your doubts so you can be at peace and understand why she did the things she did or understand her reasons as to why. Without thinking about whether the relationship will work again or not, that doesn't matter. - Okay? - Okay. You'll do it? Sometimes we see school as a type of jail and... and in the end we try and belong to a group almost as if it were a gang, we try to adapt to everything that the group does, and there's loads of pressure, we don't like being labelled, but yet we want to be labelled as part of the group, as part of the collective rather than feeling as if we are alone, because at the end of the day it's quite a tough time so it's a relief to feel as if you are part of something. With a title page...? Yes, with your personal details and a short description, personalise it. What weighting will it have? Tell him what happened. I said, "Haven't you got my number?" And he said he'd ask me for it later. He went off and then suddenly came back. - He regretted it. - He came over and said, "I really regret it, give me your number." If there's a teacher behind me who may disapprove of me for what I've done, that doesn't give me any confidence to open up before the mediators and really tell them how I feel and what has happened. I'd feel really awkward. We discussed this with Candela, who's in a real mediation group, and she said that at her school... MEDIATION GROUP ...she finally feels she has to leave, it's as though at some point she realises and she leaves, and she leaves them to it and they relax a bit more. That's how we saw it. Marta, I don't know if you remember, when we did that, you weren't in a mediation group. - Yes, I was. But I hadn't mediated. - Right. - And I still haven't. - You still haven't? You're a reserve? - Yes. - Okay. How did you see yourself, Marta, compared to a year ago? Really different to be honest. I quite liked it, I don't know. You see yourself, you see how you convey your problems in this case, and how you kind of shut out the mediators because you supposedly couldn't care less about that problem. But you're there for a reason, if you're there it's because there's been a conflict and you've come into conflict because you feel hurt, so... How did the idea occur to you? Why did you join a mediation group? I don't like it when people argue or fight or whatever, and a scheme that helps to solve problems and I don't like it when problems exist, I kill two birds with one stone. You're often afraid of being on your own but it's because you don't value other people. You've got your friends and you say, "These are my friends," but you may be getting fed up of them and you'll be left on your own because you don't value other people, you could get on well with them and you say, "I can't be bothered to find out." Or you don't try to fit in. There's no need to stick with a group, like, "This is a sect, you can't hang around with anyone else," because it happens to us a lot, kind of, "She was in this group but she goes out with people from the other group." "She doesn't value her friends!" I mean, it isn't a sect. You're free to move around in different groups. You can't move around between two groups. I've moved to a different country three times. First, I was in the same school as you, until first year of secondary, sorry, first year of primary school. Primary school. I'd made good friends. And for my family's own good, we went to our mother country, Romania, and I was there for a whole year, I made new friends, but it was harder, because you're new, they all had their close-knit groups and you come along like an outsider until you manage to fit in, and once you form part of the group... - You have to leave. - I had to leave and I came back here, and then... You've had to adapt before so in the end you adapt. It's about a girl who suffers an illness. What happens to her? - What film? - The one we saw in Religion. - Yeah, right. - That one with the girl... The one about... What was it called? - That one! - We watched it. - I know the one you mean. - The drugs one. That good actor was in it. - The one where she died in the end? - Yeah, that's the one. The Fault in Our Stars. Ideally, how would you like to be represented in a film or in cinema in general? Generally speaking. When you miss these things you often say or the clich√© or the usual things in these situations, these kinds of conflicts. As people. I mean, just people. - Without making a drama out of it. - It doesn't exist. The clich√© is always present but... more normal, just as we are. Perhaps with more serious problems, not childish ones. We want to be taken seriously. Problems are reflected as if we were dramatic, as if it were a drama, I mean, we sometimes have problems that aren't a drama, they are things we try to face up to like adults almost, and everyone says, "You're at that awkward age," "your problems are your dramas and you're exaggerating everything." You can't generalise. I get annoyed when people generalise. - Sure. - We're all different. Some groups will be more interested in smoking and others in something else. - Videogames. - Yeah, or series or whatever. Each character can't be a clich√©. A normal guy being the worst person in the world and the seemingly bad guy being better. Things that could happen, not just... I bet Sergio is a bad guy. Yeah, sure... You mean swapping roles... what you'd say judging by appearance? And also each person's own reflections. Using voice-over and someone thinking, because I do it a lot, I kind of think a lot. Yes, you talk to your friends but really you think about what's happening. - Kind of, that reflection. - Staring into space, - you fix your gaze... - And you're thinking... And you start thinking, oblivious to what people are saying to you and you carry on thinking. It might be a load of nonsense, but you're thinking. That's harder to do in a scene like the one we saw because there's always something happening. You can't introduce a dialogue of thought when something is happening. Perhaps in another scene where they go to the bathroom and they start thinking. But doing that in a scene with several people... It's not a good idea to include thought, unless the film is about one character. But if there are more people involved... Doing a voice-over for someone thinking... It interrupts the story... There's possibly a group of characters but there's one who's the focal point. - Yes, sure. - In that case you can. - It would work well. - Not so much voice-over but representing it so you can tell what they're thinking. During each school year I had my group who were like, "Yeah, my best friends." Then you had to repeat that year and your group split up. That's what happens. Like Dani's group and all the rest of them. On two separate occasions, a teacher left really angry and another left crying. Our philosophy teacher, she started crying during our lesson. I don't know what we were doing and she started saying, "I can't cope with you." She started crying and left. It was like... And everyone carried on talking. We'd just made a teacher cry, it was like, "What are you doing with your life?" I felt really bad about it. It was like, "I feel sorry for her!" He acted strange in the assembly hall. Kind of... distant. I guess he must have problems. What he said about mediation was cool. But he hardly opened up. Anyway... I don't know why I like... spending time with him, he never shows any interest in me. I don't know. Haven't I got over what happened yet, maybe? But why has he? Why haven't I? I don't understand. I write them down in rough, then I copy them into this notebook and I stick them on there. Whenever I'm alone I sit in front of the mirror. I spend all my time there, I read it and think, "You're right." There's one that says, "Small but tough," kind of, however small you might be, you can achieve many things in life. This metro map is rather curious. "My world." Yes, it's like... I'm not sure. I just thought one day, "Why not?" "Why not do this?" This is really good. It shows all the places you've visited or you'd like to visit in Madrid. Yes, I've been here. The places I'd like to go to are in green and these are the ones I've been to but I'd like to visit again. I'd sit like this. Kind of like this... Very often you are unaware of your appearance. It's like, "Who's that person sat opposite?" I don't know. I kind of stare into space. It's like... It's strange. But I love that feeling, kind of: being a stranger. It's as though I'm a stranger to myself. FIVE-MINUTE INTERVAL This is Rotor Ivanov, he's from Bulgaria but he's been living in Madrid for years. This is where he likes to go with his accordion, it's a strategic point in the centre, lots of tourists pass by, but lots of people who aren't tourists do too, like Candela and Pablo. We are really close to where we started the film, in Las Vistillas, almost a year ago. Pablo and Candela actually met doing another film around two years ago. And they've finally managed to meet up, after a long time without seeing one other in real life and in films. They catch up, Candela asks Pablo what's going on in his life, Pablo takes a while to get going, but he eventually tells her about his end of year trip to Andalusia. But before that, Pablo asks Candela about the dread lock in her hair... A friend of mine did it. Silvio. - A friend? - Silvio. REMEMBER: "WE'RE JUST FICTIONAL CHARACTERS" During a night out, one Friday... - Vita! - Gavira! - Candela, Claudia, Cristina... - H¬°. Tagging along with Gavira and Claudia, Candela ends up in Cubos subway, with a group of youths she doesn't know, but she soon feels at ease with them. It was one of those days that I told Claudia and Candela to come, I don't know how I managed to convince them. I was just doing my own thing, I guess I was avoiding them a bit. And meanwhile they were making friends in a group. - I'm Claudia. - Hi, I'm Noelia. - I'm Iv√°n. - How's it going? We were talking about music groups. - Right, she's studying Arts too... - No, I'm in 4th year. Did you bite him? We go to Cubos every weekend. We eat with our grandparents, go about our normal lives, our parents give us a hard time and we always end up in Cubos. Fridays at 4 p.m. when we don't have anything else to do and it's finally the weekend, we head to Cubos. All of the punks, metal-heads, rebels, emos... and whoever else is there, we all meet up and chat about stuff. We chat about music, our lives, what our day-to-day lives mean, perhaps things that are a bit deep for kids our age, but that's what we like. I said I'd like to study something language-related and they were like, "Yeah, social sciences." But anyway, in the end I've decided to go into teaching, so, not far off it. Silvio was in the group, I hardly know him at all, I think I've chatted to him once or twice. - Silvio offered her a cigarette... - Do you smoke? And she ended up keeping his lighter... Will you give me your lighter? I don't know if it was on purpose and she'd planned it, but she ended up using it as an excuse to talk to him. Then they found each other on Instagram, as you do, and he slid into her dms. Silvio had a super weird nickname, kurzerhandbtch or something like that, something German I think. Silvio's posts weren't especially normal but we found ourselves asking, "Who the hell is this guy?" And... well, they chatted a bit through dm, and they used the lighter as an excuse to meet up another day in Debod. Candela had been talking to me about Silvio for days and she finally told me she was going to meet him in Debod, I was happy to hear that, and she asked me to go with her, I guess to make sure she'd be safer and feel more at ease. - I think I've seen him. - Where? Over there. It was hard to find them among so many people, but they were in a group singing and dancing... they gave off a really good vibe. Silvio got up and came over to say hi. - How are you? - Good. Hi. SPRING 2017 - You came! - Yeah, it's cool. I'm with some friends, are you coming or...? Yeah, we'll say hi. - This is awesome. - We've got a guitar and everything, -dancing -Well, I missed the best part. I was chatting to Noelia and Iv√°n, who I'd spoken to in Cubos but I was really intrigued to know what these two were chatting about... I'm going for a walk. Suddenly they got up and with the excuse of going to get a beer they left, so they'd get a chance to be alone of course. Very Spanish! When I talked to Candela afterwards, I asked her if they had kissed or anything, but Candela told me they hadn't. - How old did you say you were? - Nineteen. A bit old. Nah, I'm still young. - Candela would have been 15 back then. - I'm 15. - But almost 16. - Almost 16. Coming of age is cool, right? Well... - sometimes... - Pablo, how are you? - I bumped into them on Gran Via... - What are you doing here? That guy is me. Candela asked me what I was doing there. I told her I'd come from Joy, an under-18 club, - I don't know why, it wasn't true. - What were you doing in Joy? She seemed happy to see me. - Silvio. Pablo... - And she introduced me to Silvio who was standing there, not knowing what to do. Candela seemed happy and nervous at the same time, and I didn't want to interrupt them, it looked as if there was something between them. I'll write to you. We can meet up. I pretended I was in a rush, we hugged and she told me she'd text me to meet up another day. Who was that? Pablo, he's a friend. We did a film together. That's when Candela tells Silvio that she met me two years ago when we did a film together. It was quite an experience for us because we kissed several times and we were both really embarrassed. Supposedly, it should unite you forever - or something. - Do you like films? Silvio isn't much interested in films, and he admits it. - I don't go to the pictures much. - But she loves going. Her parents like going and they've taken her with them a lot. Everyone's texting asking where we are. - Shall we head back? - Okay. I left my jacket. It's getting dark and their friends are texting. Just a pleasant walk. The Easter holidays start in a few days. - How are you doing, Cande? - Fine. On the long car journey from Madrid to Cheles, her parent's village, Candela rearranges the safety pins on her trousers. Driving through Extremadura, feeling bored and sick, she sends Silvio photos of the countryside. EASTER HOLIDAYS Get my suitcase. - Hello! - Good gracious, my Candela! Soon after, she joins her dear gran, her uncles, aunts and cousins, her village. How are you? - How are you, Gran? - Pardon? - How are you? - Fine. - Fine? - Yes. - Lots of people here for Easter? - Yes, lots, and there are more to come. - Don't you go out? - No, I don't. - Why not? - Because I'm old now. - What do you want, sweetie? - She wants you. Your granny, right? Granny. Going to the village has its good points and bad points. And this visit comes at a pretty bad time for Candela. Right then, this is... Jorge, you're being filmed. You'll be in a film. We'll go to the steps. - We'll go this way, I'll help you. - I have trouble with steps. No. The next day, when Candela takes her gran to Mass, she has a funny feeling. Soon after, she picks out Silvio, on the steps next to the village church. As she climbs each of the church steps her heart beats faster and faster. She leaves her gran with her mum and she slips away, trying not to draw attention to the boy following her close behind. Candela's first reaction is that of anger and fear. She tries to act as normal. She can't believe what's happening. But as they walk away from the church, she laughs and her emotions come forth. Are you stupid? My mum was there, my gran, my cousins, everyone. Everyone knows me! You're mad! It was unbelievable. The waitress from the bar was to the left of you, I've known her all my life, since I was a kid. And my uncle Jacinto was there, the official village reporter. And the mayor, he's a relative of ours, he was there... I saw you and I didn't know what to do. They walk away from the village until Silvio asks where she's taking him. She says she doesn't know, but far away. It occurs to her that they could reach the reservoir. They leave the village behind and walk through the fields. I saw the photo you put on Instagram, when you're in Cheles next to the church. And I thought, "I'm here in Madrid, bored sick." So I looked it up on the Internet: Madrid-Cheles. And I got up at eight o'clock this morning, and I caught the bus. I got off at Badajoz and I had to wait half an hour because I had to catch another bus to Cheles. And I finally got to the village. - I've been wandering around for two hours. - You're mad. Candela still thinks Silvio is mad, but she's calmed down and she's glad to be with him. She's never had an adventure in her village. She talks about her parent's love story, they're from Cheles, and for the first time ever she feels proud of it. All my grandparents are from the village. My parents got together when they were my age. Then she asks Silvio where he's from. He says he's from Ecuador, though he didn't live there for long. His dad died when he was a baby. His mum came to Spain in search of opportunities. Where did you live in Ecuador? My mum told me it was called El Oro, I think. It's odd how Silvio can't remember the name of the place he was born. I lived with my parents, but when I was ten months old, my dad died in a car accident. They get to the jetty. Candela has known it all her life. Families go there in summer and when it's sunny. She explains that the land on the other side is Portugal. She also explains that it was the smugglers' route. Families used to cross to buy tobacco, coffee and other goods. They throw stones into the water, not really knowing what to do. - Have you ever crossed? - Where to? - To Portugal. - No. Then Silvio says he'd love to see Portugal. He suggests taking a kayak and rowing, to leave the country, just for a few minutes. The music could come in here. It was composed by Andrei, one of Silvio's friends whom he calls "the Russian". It's cool. Here we go. Training for the Olympics in kayak. Hey, get rowing. - How are you doing? - Fine. I'll take you if you like. We made it. Here, grab this. Perfect. PORTUGAL Hang on. We'll get carried away. What time is it? I haven't got my phone. It's eight o'clock, they'll be looking for me. What? We'll have to head back to Spain. Silvio and Candela have crossed the reservoir and they're back in the village before nightfall. It gets dark really late during Easter Week. They share a cigarette at the bus stop waiting for Silvio's bus to Madrid. They do it in secret, Candela can't let the villagers see her smoking. Neither smoking nor with him. But when the bus comes, she's the one who makes a move to steal the last kiss. See you soon. Then Silvio gets on the bus leaving Candela alone at the bus stop. It's hard to explain what she's feeling inside. She feels a kind of electric shock, and then a tingling, her heart is beating fast and she tries to breathe slowly. Images of what she's just experienced flash through her mind. It's as though it wasn't real. What a crazy day! Silvio goes over what happened. He's not sure he did the right thing. This time yesterday, he decided to buy the ticket to Cheles, and 24 hours later, he's heading back to Madrid filled with mixed feelings. Wow, but I had such a good time... For a moment, he fears having seemed intrusive, it's in his nature, but he doesn't want Candela to get him wrong. Although later, when he cut me off... He recalls when Candela cut him short saying they had to head back to Spain and he smiles. He thinks he's never known anyone so special. IT'S BEEN A STRANGE DAY HAHA Silvio has texted her from the bus to Madrid. And Candela, now in bed, replies. Then he writes something we're not to know about. I always thought... that after... I'd liked a lot of girls but none of them ever liked me and I always thought that nobody... I always thought nobody was going to like me, because... I don't know why. And I remember that she was the one who told me she loved me, which was crazy because I loved her too and it was like... she wants the same as me, that's awesome. - Love you? - Yes. That's good, right? It's also that feeling of being able to say it, and them saying it to you, and that it's the other person who takes the plunge and says it. The feeling that they want the same as you do. And being able to say "I love you" isn't that easy. - We've drifted a bit. - To love. That's okay, loads of people find it hard to talk about it, you guys do too, but in the end it's weird not to talk about it because it's probably the most important thing. - Yeah sure. - Is there anything more important? I think love is very idealised, I don't know, it's not the same at the start as it is after you've been together 5 or 10 years. The essence of everything changes, or at least I felt that way, after three years, it's as if something changes in you. I mean, we're at an age when... I don't know, maybe not, but with the guy I'm with, I mean, I don't know, but I'm not thinking about the long-term, nor do I want to... I don't know, I don't want to tie myself down - because we're at an age in which... - Just no. We want to experiment, we'll think one thing today and the next day something else, we're totally bipolar. Right now, I'm more interested in my partner's life than my own, and it doesn't have to be like that, you can't get attached to the other person... I don't know, but deep down you spend more time thinking about the other person and whether they are happy than whether you are happy yourself, and I think that in the end, when the relationship ends, you realise that perhaps it wasn't like that but deep down you were really happy sharing everything with the other person and thinking about them more than yourself. I'd like to add something else, it's something I really like: I've been with my partner for two years today and it's true that I'm always thinking about her. But today I've been thinking about myself! And I realised... and as you said, it's a bit strange to be like that, but I was thinking about myself and I realised that since I've been with her I love myself more. It's really weird, but that's how it is. That makes me think that love isn't blind, it's the complete opposite. Falling in love is blind, but true love, true love can see and it doesn't need glasses. - You learn to love and love yourself. - And see with a magnifying glass. And now completely changing topic, did you have an end of year trip? - Yes, to Italy at the end of 4th year. - The end of 4th year and... - They didn't go. - I didn't go, - I'd already been there with my family. - Okay. Rony, you went, how was it? I went with all the people I planned to go with from my group... - There were loads who didn't go... - Teachers went with you, right? Yes, two teachers went, Jossie went and Montserrat the maths teacher did too, and it was an incredible experience because we got to go on holiday without our parents and with our friends, and we got to share opinions with them about... I don't know, the architectural stuff we saw or other stuff. It was really funny, because the teacher who was here, I mean we aren't going to lie... - Did she go on the trip with you? - Yeah. There were people drinking, I was too... everyone was, and of course we were lucky that we'd bought a bottle of lemon Fanta, and she was there keeping an eye on us and she came down and said, "Hey, let's see that," and I was thinking shit... So I gave it to her and she sniffed it and was like, "It's only lemon Fanta, you don't have any alcohol," I mean, what a fucking idiot. Wow, that's awesome, I love the logo. - Yeah, my girlfriend did it. - Seriously? Yeah, it's super cool, isn't it? My sisters did the front cover, they worked really hard on it, I'm really happy with it. Guys, pay attention, okay? - How are you doing? - Fine. Listen, we'll start off dealing with the allocation of rooms. As I said, you'll be in shared rooms of four, two bunk beds in each, you can sort yourselves out. I'm not going to say boys with boys, girls with girls. You have your own criteria and common sense. Pedro will pass the sheet round, but remember, if there are 28 on the way there, there'll be 28 on the way back. Right. Well, here we are watching the typical end of year trip that they go on at the end of sixth form and these are students from a secondary school in Madrid who are going on a trip to Andalusia. They're going to Cordoba, Seville and Granada. Here they are deciding on the room allocations, deciding who is going to share a room with who, sorting out the groups, which will define the whole trip. Although the truth is, where you sit on the bus more or less determines who you will be with for the rest of the trip. - Is that the groups list? - Yes, who shall we go with? Jorge, we've been put in a group. In fact, on the bus, you can see that the ones at the front are planning it all out. The ones at the back don't seem to care much. - Are you coming with us? - Alright. Well, Gonzalo, Dani and me, with Pablo. Well, that guy there was Pablo's friend but he isn't with Pablo now, he's with another girl on the bus who he seems to have a thing with. We're all rather hypocritical. I mean... Okay, you don't wax your legs or whatever... - but then you don't manage to... - No, but still, when you see someone who doesn't wax, applaud them all the same... Where you sit on the bus and how you interact with people defines the group you belong to at the end of the year, and I don't think Pablo is in any of those groups and he's quite alone. You can see he isn't really hanging out with anyone at the moment, not knowing where he's going to sleep or fit in. Guys! Guys! What? We've made a record! I'll play a song before you doze off. Just so you know, remember: Linze with a z, "Dame m√°s", you can have it cheaper 'cos you're my pals. How's that? This is just the opening show. Go for it, F√©lix. IF THERE ARE 28 ON THE WAY THERE, THERE'LL BE 28 ON THE WAY BACK Hello! Hello. - Hi, guys. - Come on, listen up, please. - Thank you. - Hello. Hello. First of all, I'd like to welcome you all. My name's Maria, I'll be your guide during this visit, your end of school-year trip, and as you know we're in Granada and we'll be going to Cordoba and Seville. I'll be with you in all three cities. You have a while to relax, freshen up, whatever you like till 6 p.m. - Until 6 p.m. - The coach will be here at 6 p.m. We'll be going for a walk around the Albayz√≠n, one of the prettiest districts in Granada. You'll get to learn about this city in a very magical place, all right? So then, welcome and nice meeting you. - And you too. - Right. The key. And it's a really cool time, because the end of year trip is... something that you've been waiting for all year and you feel like you deserve it. It's the first time you'll get to spend so much time with the people that you've shared a large part of your life with. Wait here a minute, I'd like to tell you something. Have you noticed the Albayz√≠n has very narrow streets, they're like labyrinths, right? Lots of corners. You'll have noticed it's hot in this city. So, the houses are cool because of the narrow streets, they keep them cool and offer shade. It's common in Andalusia, as we'll see in the other two cities. Come on, time to walk uphill. Right, listen now. This is the Arco de la Pesas. Be careful. It's kind of the first time you get to see them outside of school and at night. You'll find out how they sleep or dance, and it's also like you can be whoever you want, you can be whoever you want to be. Make some room so everyone can see, okay? Let's make our way through, try and find a space. We'll stand over here. Pedro, see if we can all fit in. Right, we're in front of the Alhambra. As you can see, the image of the Alhambra is extremely prominent, don't you think? The reddish tones. Can you see the tones? Alhambra means "the red one", and Alhamar began to build it. Legend has it that he looked out of the window at night and he could see the reddish ridge, called "the red hill of the Alhambra". So, he decided to build his fortress there, because he'd just taken Granada, he had friends but he had enemies too, he'd feel safer there. We had the Alhambra as a city or town... - As a city. - Listen. And we also had Granada which was on this side. Beyond that tower, everything was built by the following generations. They built palaces and gardens, and what you can see in the background is the Generalife. - Right, come on, say Granada! - Granada! We say "Gran√°". Ready. - Back here in ten minutes, okay, guys? - Okay. - Ten minutes. - All right, see you in a bit. Ten minutes. - Spray some on us. - Yes, please. I think I blinked. Yes, spray me! Right there. Hydration. - You're baptised. - How nice. - You can see the suffering. - You've wet my glasses. - Spray him. - Revenge. - That'll do. - He loves it. - He's challenging you. - Give it here. Typical, a science student. Here. - You should see mine. - You bet. - Look at Javi's. - Mine's the best. - Look at mine... - This is top-notch. - That signature? - That signature... - It occurred to me at the time. - Look at his face. - It could pass as you. - It was before I changed and stuff. - Changed? - When are these two coming back? - No one saw you? - No. What have you bought? - They had no Jager. - No shit. - They had none left. - It's all they had. - Negrita rum and vodka. - Shit. - I need a rucksack. - Has anyone got one? - I have. - Yeah. Javi, you've got a big bag, lend us your bag. There's a problem, it's full of books. - Fucking hell. - Seriously? - I don't know, man. You know me. - Listen, mate. I'll take your books. I think mine is too small. - It won't fit. - No. We need another bag. Yeah, I don't know, I hadn't thought about it. - Ready? - Ready. - Right, perfect. - Bring the alcohol. We're here to have a good time. I have a good time reading. I don't know. - I like going someplace secluded. - What place? We've no time. - No, here, Andalusia, dammit. - Come on! We'll be going places on the coach. Where are you going to read? On the coach. - That's enough, I guess. - Pour some more in. It'll blow our heads off. - We're in room 228. - Who's in there? I'm not sure, mate. Javi, Oli, Lucas, everyone. - Come with us. - How much do we have to pay? About three euros I think, it's not much. Come along, it'll be good. - Shall we go? - I don't know, I don't feel like it. - Are you seriously going to go? - I guess, man, I fancy going. - Aren't you coming, then? - No, I'd rather stay here and rest. - Have you ever had an erotic dream...? - Exactly... about a teacher. - Well, I can tell you a name. Peter. - Peter! It was obvious. - No! - Did she say yes? - What? - Look at her. - No. - No? What a liar. - Who? - Peter. The PE teacher? No. No! - No. - Tell us about it. - No shit! - I couldn't look at him the next day. - No, but... - I didn't know. - Awesome. - It doesn't leave this room, man. Only 'cos I'm pissed, I wouldn't have told you otherwise. That's not fair. - It's one way of putting it. - Guess who's had erotic dreams with Peter? - The guide! - The guide, have you noticed? Don't get jealous, it's cool. It's Lucas' turn. - Gonzalo, he's sat here all quiet. - He hasn't said a word. - All right. - Go on, Gonzalo. Right, truth. - Shit. - Bloody hell. - Bloody hell. - The booze. - Shit, what do we do? - Open the window. Where have you put the booze? - For Christ's sake. - Man! - Don't panic, it's only this dude. - Fucking hell, mate! - Fucking hell! - Warn us. - You're a bit late turning up now. - We'll have to use a password. - Have a drink. - You're an idiot, man. We should use a code or something to come in. - Don't keep the bottle to yourself. - What are you doing? - Nothing, we were... - Do you want to know what we were doing? - They were asking Lucas a question. - Command or truth? - Command or truth. - No. - It's Gonzalo's turn. - Go on, Gonz. Truth. - Truth. - Tru-truth. - Truth. - Truth. - Truth. - Right. We could ask him the classic one. Who would you screw in this bedroom? - The classic question. - Who would you screw? - The legendary. - Come on. - Honestly? - Yes, honestly. All the girls. Who? All of us? - Fucking hell, how romantic! - You've no filter, man. No, mate, I've no filter. You've got a sieve! Let them fall through! Lick Jorge's foot. - Go on. - Go on! - Lick his blister. - Go on, lick it. - Wait. - Careful. - Careful. - I don't believe it. - The sole of his foot. - Go on. - And his toes too. - His little toe as well. That one the most. - A quick lick. - Go on, a quick one. - No! - Go on! - Is Lautaro asleep? - Still. You have to kiss Lautaro and wake him up. - Like Sleeping Beauty. - Yeah, man. - No, come on. - You said command. - Yeah. - Please, man. - Is he awake or asleep? - Asleep. - He's out of it, he's in limbo. - He's out of it. Let's see how you get down. Kiss him with your lips, not with your foot. It's just a peck. - No, don't you dare. - Look what he's doing. - Lautaro, you're playful. - Fuck off, don't you dare. Go on, kiss him. No, forget this command. - Don't chicken out. - I didn't choose command, so forget it. - You can't do that. - A garment, Lautaro. - Let him kiss your foot at least. - Fuck off. - Anywhere at all. - Lautaro, garment. - The jury has its say. - I didn't choose. The jury dictates: either he kisses him or he has to kiss his foot. - It's his choice. - Kiss his foot. Yeah, and he can lick my balls. - Who's smoking? - The puma! - It's your turn with dare. - Right, Claudia. - Right, but a good one. - Claudia. - It's her turn for a dare, right, Lucia? - Yes. - You have to declare your love to someone. - Who to? Who? Who can she declare her love to? Declare your love to Pablo. - Yes. - Yes, Pablo, please. - Yes, please. - No, man. - He'll hit me. - You daren't do it. I daren't. Go to Pablo's room and declare your love to him. - Go on. - What do I say? - You can do it. - What you feel about him. - How you've felt all this time. - Yeah, go on. - For three years. - Take a swig and go. Okay, I'll finish this and go. - Let's go. - Ol√©. It's been a year. You've been in love with him for a year. - One year. - What do I say? - You kneel down and say whatever. - Say, "I really like you." - On your knees. - Go on, go for it. - Go on. - Go for it. - She's going for it. - Let's see you do it. - Go for it. - I'm going. - Go on. - This is a bit wet. You're the one who's a bit wet... - Have I woken you up? - No, but I was about to go to bed. - Are you alright? - Yes. I wanted to talk to you for a minute. - Okay, then. - Right, you see... The thing is... I mean... It's hard for me to admit this but I've been... I've been in love with you for over a year. I like you. - Peter's coming! Run! - Peter! What are you doing? What's he doing? Why do we always get such strange PE teachers? - To make it exciting. - Just look at him, the poor guy... What's he doing? The panorama at seven in the morning, Pedro is doing his stretches. My god... Their late-night drinking games always tend to end with rather cruel jokes and... this time it was Pablo who was being ridiculed. Well, he told me that the next day, before getting on the bus, Claudia, the girl who had laughed at him, apologised to him and told him she felt really bad about it. Anyway, in Cordoba things started to get better for Pablo, - in fact that morning a group of guys... - Pablo, - do you want to sit with us? - Alright. - I'll make some room for you. - Clear a space. The guys who hadn't been involved in the previous nights' antics told him he could sit with them at breakfast, so he was a bit less alone. They're interested in all the excursions and the more fun... no, not fun, the more... the more academic parts of the trip. They're generalising "So that people may enter." Whoever. Open the doors to everyone. - Bear in mind... - I'd love that. When Nazism was on the rise, the Shintoists also emerged. The Shintoists are extremist with the issue of "the chosen ones". - They are the chosen ones. - But this was before that. - Pretty please, here. - Ta. - Listen, I've got loads of knots... - Hey, Rony... - I don't know what to wear. - Try it on. This one is really blue, but I'm wearing black, so I don't know. - No. - The other one. - You sure? - It'll look great. - Let me look. - I'll give you a hand. Have you got any aftersun? I'm burnt. - Rony, have you got some? - It's in my room. In your room. Rony, which is your room? I like the blue one. Thanks. - What about this one? - Perfect. - That'll do. - Have you found the mascara? I'll put this away. Why don't you look in a mirror? - I'll take a photo at sunset. - That's it. Do it in a mirror, it's easier. - No. - Yes. This is a mismatch You say you've expertise But your mind starts to cease Then you come to realise That you ain't so wise No matter what time I see it all the time You copy the dictionary rhymes Can't you talk? I think Pablo felt that... it made sense for him to be there. You'll just have to learn A fish out of water can't swim The fish is dead - Shall we play it? - Okay. - There aren't any lyrics. - It doesn't matter. Alright. - Normal first of all. - Yes, then I'll change key. One, two, three and... What the hell are you doing playing the guitar? Come on, guys. Let's make a move. - It's delicious. So smooth. - I hate you. - I'll take more off you. - So will I. - It's so nice. - What flavour is it? No! - It's delicious. - Really sweet. - God, it tastes like medicine. - These two are the best. It's really nice, isn't it? - Thank you. - Thank you. - Anything else? - No, nothing else. Serviettes, guys. - Give me one. - The raspberry one is delicious. Hey, isn't that...? - Hi! - Hello. - Hello. - Hello, good evening. - Good evening. - How are you? And when they went for a walk in the evening, they bumped into the PE teacher taking a stroll with the guide and he was trying to flirt with her a bit. Pablo told me that they made up a song and everything about this romance. Go to the bridge, it's pleasant there - and it's cool by the river. - A nice breeze. There's a statue of St. Raphael the Archangel the patron saint of Cordoba, you can light a candle and make a wish. - It's really nice. - Okay. - Alright. - It sounds good. - Right, good night. - Good night. - See you later. - Bye. - Early back... - Yes. Okay. Did you see her? She looked really nice in that dress. - With lipstick on. - God, she was... Did you see Pedro? His face changed completely. Well, Pablo and Rony began to be more attentive to one another and they started talking more, sharing more, and looking at each other more... - You've never been here before, I guess. - No, not to Cordoba. - What about you? - Me neither. - I'm quite enjoying it. - It's beautiful. I love the little plant pots along the streets and the colours. Yes, it's a very lively city. Well, they talked to each other shyly, they're both quite shy, so they found it awkward to look straight into each other's eyes. It's nice and cool by the river. - Have you got a lighter? - I think I have. - It'll be easier. - Wait. Yes. How do we do this? Light it, make a wish, blow it out... So, having listened to what the guide had told them, they crossed the bridge and went to the statue of the Archangel St. Raphael. And Rony... lit a candle and made a wish. If it blows out does it bring bad luck? - Shit, mine has blown out. - What? This is a bad omen. - Can you let me have one? - Yes. Are you going to get one? - Aren't you going to get one? - No. Seeing that Pablo couldn't bring himself to do it, she got another candle and lit if for him so he could make a wish. - Make a wish. - Me? - I make a wish then leave it? - I guess so. Although we don't actually know what Pablo wished for I think it's going to come true. - Seriously? Are you kidding me? - Come on, I need good photos. Go on, Rony, get in. I'm singing in the rain - It's a bit slimy. - Yeah, it is a bit. - One, two, three. Seville! - A crazy photo, of all of us. - Yeah, come on! - One, two, three. Kurkuveu means "rainbow". - What does that mean? - What do you think it is? - A good trip or something like that? - No. - I don't know. - It's "I like..." - I like... - "...life". Life. Right. What else? Let's see what I can think of. - The similar words are easier. - Yes. Words that sound similar. Sandale. You say it. - Sandal. - Yes. That one is similar. Okay. Ochi. It's written with c-h-i. The letters ch aren't pronounced like... - Kind of... - Yes. - It's like a k sound. - Yes, it's like a k. - I've no idea. - Eyes. - Are your parents Rumanian? - Yes, both of them, from the same area. - Where from? - From Constanta. It's on the coast. Rony tells Pablo that her parents are from Constanta, a city on the Romanian coast, although she was born in Madrid, in the same hospital as Pablo. But she still doesn't have Spanish nationality due to some bureaucratic nonsense or something like that, and she'll have to wait until she's 18 to get Spanish nationality. She's 16 now. - What about you? - I was born in Madrid, in La Paz, too. - Thanks. - I might doze off with a soft song. As you wish. - Can I choose one? - Sure, I won't look. I like this one. It takes a while to start, I don't know which one it is. This one... - It's really nice. I love this singer. - Yeah, me too. Okay. - Play a different one if you like. - No, it's fine. I'll make a note of this one. I think I'll... It's really relaxing. - How far have we gone? - I don't know. And just like that Rony asks Pablo if she can put her head on his shoulder. - Do you mind? - No. Pablo didn't quite expect this but he says yes, and she takes off her glasses. - Shall I play the other one? - And she moves closer to him... It's changed songs. And she leans on him... Pablo looks at her, not really knowing how he ended up with this girl sleeping next to him, and he leans on her a bit too and suddenly... Rony strokes his hand and they end up holding hands. FRAGILE AS THE WORLD It was May, and the San Isidro bank holiday, and Candela persuaded me to go to the cinema. She took me to the film archive to see a really weird film, a Portuguese film, as if our relationship had always been tied to Portugal. I actually liked the film although it was a bit weird, but I admit I was thinking more about what was going to happen after. One of Candela's friends had left us her place, she was a bit older and lived in her own attic apartment, but we didn't go there straight after the cinema. We went to the fair first, wandered around a bit and had a couple of beers. I think we needed to get a bit drunk before going back to the house. I was actually more nervous than she was. Yes, we did it for the first time. Well, it wasn't my first time, but it was hers. SAN ISIDRO FESTIVAL FIVE-MINUTE INTERVAL Do you remember? We stopped using them when we stumbled upon the box, that's it. LAST CLASSES This was on our way home, some guy pissed, - another wasted... I was wasted. - It doesn't surprise me. In these situations... - Hello. - Hello. What are you doing here, guys? Why aren't you inside? We don't have exams now. But you'll have something, a class... we're finishing. The ethics teacher didn't come so I thought I'd get a bit of air. Yes, but you know there's a teacher on duty and anything you do now you won't have to do at home. Whatever I do now, with the two I've failed, to try and sort out the two I've failed, study whatever and they won't give me my diploma, it's a complete joke too. We'll see if they give it you or not, you need to make sure they see you're there and present... it's all about attitude. I've told them I want to change school and do something else. That's a different matter, make sure your teachers see you, you need the teachers to see you in class, your attitude. The teaching board gave me their thumbs up. Forget about teaching boards, it's all about attitude, make yourself seen, be present... everything counts. If they're going to ruin my summer by making me do the same in September, what's the point of studying now? Well, you know what I'm saying or what I'm trying to say, okay, see you later. What was all that about? Pray that there's a vacancy at the other school. - I'll end up doing sixth form here. - They won't leave you here... I mean, if you can't get a place elsewhere, I guess. No, but to have an option at least, a safe option, try here... You've got that here, I want to do a vocational course elsewhere. How do I do it? If they don't want to give me my diploma I can't enrol elsewhere, well, I mean, I can't reserve a place. If you don't want to stay for sixth form they can't make you waste a whole year. - What are you playing? - Old maid. - Shall we have a game? - How do you play? You have to put down cards that are the same number or higher, - I don't know if I'm explaining properly. - The ace closes. Deal them out, we get it now. - Which ones are mine? - These. If you play the same card as the one before it, you miss a turn. - Hey, mate. - Hello. How's it going? - Here I am. - What are you doing here? I've come to collect a certificate then I'll go and see the history teacher. - To say bye? - Yeah. That's cool, - what are you doing in the end? - Social Education. - Did you get the grades you needed? - Of course. - Where? - The Complutense. - That's cool, right? - Yeah. I still don't know what I want to study. - Here you go, Jorge. - Thanks. Don't worry about it, I was the same as you in 4th year, and look at me now. But you knew what you wanted the whole year. - It'll be the same for you, you'll see. - I hope so. I'm supposed to be in class, so I'm going to head up, okay? - Okay. - It was great to see you, mate. - You too. - See you around, okay? - Sure. - See you. Bye. And don't forget, fundamentally we are language, language with words mostly, but, I mean, even people who can't speak with words because they have some sort of difficulty, well, they manage to invent signs so they can communicate. As you develop and enrich this attitude you'll go further in all aspects of your life, even in terms of your happiness, because don't forget that happiness is the ultimate goal, and very often being happy doesn't just mean going out to parties, or dancing or shouting... Being happy, I think, it's what you feel when you are in harmony with your life, with yourself and with others, and language helps a lot with this, because if not... Why do we come to class? So much language, so much syntax, so much literature? Well, all of this is relevant to...? Well, I don't know, you started saying... More than anything, language helps us to be happy and content with ourselves. You'll realise this when you're older, right now, due to all the pressure, you see it as more of an obligation. I imagine that given it's the last day of school and the last day of the program the others will have decided to spend their time doing something more interesting, so I'm extremely grateful that you came, it means a lot to me. It's over there, behind that wall. Behind the wall? A bit higher up, look it doesn't matter. - There you go. - There's like a small ponytail. - No. - Yes, here. God, I'll have to cut it off. - Silvio, someone's coming. - What are you on about? Is that Silvio? Silvio, you could have told me, you dickhead. What are you doing here? Are you painting or what? - What about you? - How are you? - Hi. - How are you? - Candela... - Hi. - What the fuck are you doing? - I don't know, I don't know whether to add purple or blue. - Do you think it's missing something? - Pink. Paula, come here a minute, what do you reckon? It's missing something, it lacks bright colours, you know... I saw one of my pieces totally effaced in the Latina neighbourhood, with bitch and stuff written on it, and I just don't get it, but I guess it comes with being a girl in the graffiti world, you know? - Being X's bird. - X's bird. The other day I went to get paints, and the guy that sold them said, "I know you, you've painted with so-and-so" and I was like, "Haven't you seen the 3,000 pieces I've done myself?" Why do I always have to be "X's bird"? I just don't get it, mate. It's a real problem, I'll never get recognition. Or when they say about meeting up and they are like, "We're going to paint and then..." because we've painted together, "Well, come to my house etc..." And you feel obliged to hook up with them, - it's terrible. - Jerks, anyways... Anyway... Candela, whenever you want you can come with us. - Yeah, to the centre. - Do you fancy it? Around la Latina... It'd be awesome for the four of us to go and paint one day. Listen to this fab song I've just written... Fucking society Fucking society They want us to live like city rats This fucking society Your fucking society We don't have everything But we're not without What I want and need Is what they don't have They keep the money And we have assets This world is corrupt And no one can dodge disease Everyone is lost And they believe in equality The government is fucking us off And they're backed up They want us to carry on With this game they've created They have the Nationals in the game Don't fuck with me I'm not scared of Babylon Fucking society Your fucking society They want you to live like city rats I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO TOMORROW Forty-three percent of boys between the age of 16 and 19 wanted to study Engineering, Architecture or a scientific degree, and only 17% of the girls. Of the girls, 79% chose Medicine, Law, Social Sciences, for example, Education, Pre-school Education, Medicine, Psychology, Nursing, Primary Education... Things closely related to helping, voluntary work and public services, yet the majority of boys tended towards technical engineering. That's how it is. It doesn't surprise us much. It's what we've seen at school. If you ask, almost all the boys... In my class we call them "the scientists", they all want to do Science and study Engineering and be the inventors of the century. Maybe one girl wants to study Sciences and it's like... I don't know. Why do you think that is? Then you think about it and you hope it isn't due to what is socially inculcated and so on. You hope it isn't due to that. But it looks as though it is. I think we're making progress, but not that much. The past still carries a lot of weight, and many years will pass before Sciences cease to be a thing for boys and perhaps public oriented careers cease to be a thing for girls. It pisses me off but that's how it will be. Pass me the lighter. Is that where you see yourself? Do you think you'll end up in that idea of public service? If you had to think of where you might end up, as a career, - is that where you see yourself? - I don't want to answer that, Jon√°s. Carry on with your debate. I often think I'd like to hit rock bottom. I saw it in a film called Fight Club, I don't know if you've seen it, and there's a bit that says you can only really live once you've hit rock bottom. If you hit rock bottom, upwards is the only way to go. You know, when you're not afraid of death, you can really live life. I sometimes think I'd like to have nothing, and be in the shit... - Like, on an island... - Sort of. Being in the shit and the only way out is upwards, you know? With no fears. You're always telling me you're afraid of dying. It's quite normal, but fear of living also stops you from doing lots of things. Me and everyone. It isn't fear of dying, like, "Oh, I'm dying," - but fear of ceasing to exist. - Fear of ceasing to think - and reflect on things. - Ceasing to exist. - Ceasing to feel. - When you don't exist, there's nothing... I used the example of my bedroom because I feel I don't belong anywhere. I don't feel I belong in my house or anywhere at all, I don't feel at ease... Well, only sometimes. I feel comfortable with people or in the environment I'm in, what we're doing and so on. But I don't feel at ease with myself, where I am, where I exist. I don't feel comfortable... Well, it's not that. I feel I don't belong. It's as though I don't belong anywhere. And "my home", so to speak, isn't the whole house, with the people I live with, all the rooms, the kitchen and lounge, and my room, which I share with my brother. But I have my home which is my chair, my bed, and my computer, my bag, my desk and that's it. - That bit is "my home". - And you're proud of that bit. - That's the bit you like, where you are. - It's the only place of my own. It's like my home, yes. But I can't change much from there. I can and I can't. It's useless feeling proud of your country because if you want to change it... You feel proud of part of your country because you love it, you see the good things, you want to be proud of the whole and you change the part you don't like. There's no making head nor tail of it, - Spain... - No making head nor tail? - Spain is a country... - The Age of Enlightenment didn't get here, the longest Republic has been three years. We still live in a pseudo-dictatorship. Okay, that's the part you don't like about Spain. Spain isn't just that. Spain is the people living here, everything Spain has gone through, it's the art in Spain. Have you been to the Prado Museum? That's Spain. The Prado has paintings by Goya, Velazquez.. No other country has those paintings, excellent paintings. - That's my country. - True, we have Picasso but he fled because he was ashamed of the country he lived in. Because he didn't change it. Because he was an idiot. He painted Guernica to vindicate what he felt. Okay, fine. But people don't think of Guernica as vindication. But you do, it's reached one person. And many others like you. It's never a whole, it's always a part. But here you find that when you try to voice how you feel, they stifle you. Carry on shouting. If you shout, I might shout, then he might. - And others may follow. - But it's not people saying, "Excuse me, be quiet." They hit you or beat you with sticks. Okay, they can beat us with a stick. They'll run out of sticks. They have lots of sticks and lots of money to buy more. - So what? - We haven't the power to stand up to them. Fine, there are five. Five is a big number. If these five join up with five more, that's ten, you know? There are only 45 million more. You can't just think about the sticks and the rest. You have to think that if you continue, you'll be greater than the number of people who say no. If you respect that idea, you won't change anything in Spain. As I see it... The idea you're fighting for is respect, not for everything to be the same. I think it's incredible. I think the group that has most changed Spain has been ETA, with bombs. That's something I'd never consider. It's impossible. Do you know what life is? How great it is to live? Feeling the worst shit ever is great. People who don't exist can't feel that. Snails can't feel that, man. You know what it's like, you know how good it is. Could you take that away from someone else? Could you? I can't believe you could take away something like feeling love, or grief. Seriously, it's unbelievable. You can't take that away. But what I'm saying is... And I think you'll agree with me... The greatest pressure and the greatest blow to Spain has been through terrorism. And just as I think that coming down to those levels is deplorable, and all we can do is shout, go on strike time after time, take part in activism when we're already going a bit too far with human rights, all you can do is shout and no one listens. Mixing the diversity of ideas... I feel I'm in a country where I can't change anything. I'm not proud of its origins, what that country conveys. Thinking about the bad aspects is a start at least. Thinking about what isn't right. So far you haven't sat back saying it's shit and counting down the minutes before you leave. You stand up. Perhaps you don't hate it so much. I do what I can. I've joined in strikes, I help my brother stick up stickers when I can. Whatever I can. - As much as you can. - But all that effort you've made to try to change the country has been a waste of time. - What do you mean, a waste of time? - It's useless. Have you got a friend who was different before you met and who you've helped? - I bet you have. - Perhaps. You've done something. You've opened someone's eyes through your way of thinking. You've given someone more possibilities. That's something. You're right. I'm not talking about staging a revolution. We ought to do it one by one... but... I think it's so... Everyone wants to change the world but no one sets about doing it. You've changed something. - Two people. - Okay. Two people. Two people who have changed from being communists to anarchists, and another who has become vegan. That's it. That's the most I've achieved in my life. And I've carried on trying. If you throw in the towel, you're doing exactly the opposite of what you want: to change the world. If you really want to change something, you have to keep on trying. Even though it's gradual and you get stick for it, the reward is inner. No matter how many blows you receive, not trying would be more painful than the blows I received, I wouldn't feel proud of myself. And having changed just one person, their way of thinking, believe it or not, that person might tell someone else and you create a chain. But if you throw in the towel from the start, you aren't giving the other person a chance to open their eyes and you're missing the chance to change things. It's like... if you have no vision you can't do anything, and I find that quite sad. I also find it sad that people come to think that only violence can solve things. Very often... I mean, it's really sad, because many people have that view and in a way they end up behaving that way. If you focus on doing things correctly from the start, like you've been doing, camping out and things like that, step by step... Throwing in the towel is no use. Throwing in the towel is of less use than what you're doing which you say is a waste of time. - That's my girl! - Perseverance. I don't think frustration should be considered the enemy, something bad, because frustration itself is what urges you on. If that frustration and anger didn't exist, you'd feel no need to change anything. I'm not saying it's good, because frustration is the last thing you want to feel, but rather than considering it as something negative, consider it a driving force towards reaching your goal. Transform the negative into something that you really want to change. That's what the human being is: envy, violence, senseless aggressiveness, but the human being... We said before that music was the most important thing to us. The human being created music. If you do away with human beings, what will you achieve? You'll put an end to all the good things human beings have done. - Great things. - Giving art to eliminate violence. - Would that work? - No. It's a pack. Not everything will be good or bad. But the good things are just as powerful as the bad things, or more. Bad things are good too. Feeling bad things is good. I don't mean feeling bad things, which is cool, but it's more to do with things we find repulsive, like thinking that the human being does nothing but destroy. - That's ridiculous. - Do you know what scares me? We say all this now when we're young and when we're older, we'll forget about all our ideas, our diversity of thought and we'll end up driving a Mercedes Benz like everyone else, watching football... In that case there'll be a Gavira junior with a shaven head who'll look at you sickened with loathing. It's real fear. If that scares you, it means you'll never be like that. There's a quote by Socrates or Aristotle, one of those ancient Greek blokes, that says: "Anyone who does not live in society is either a god or a mad man." A beast. No, it's: "He who is unable to live in society" "must be either a god or a monster." Or a beast. You need other people to achieve personal fulfilment. Life on your own... If you go to live on a desert island in isolation... It's hard to imagine living alone. It's in our nature. I think that's what has led us to change, and since you need others you can't wish them the worst because it also affects you. Changes have taken place because we need others and we need the best for everyone. That's what brings about these changes. We need one another. Being the only person would be so boring. In the sense that no one would refute you. No one would make you think, you'd know nothing else. Is it fine to be the god of something that has nothing more to it? - Your own world. - A shit concrete column, is it fine being the king of a concrete column, one you've created, with nothing more to it? Just imagine me on my island with my things and nothing else. - I'd live quite well. - Even on your "burn the world down" days? Knowing what I know now, with the knowledge I have, I'd live alone on an island. - Or with someone maybe. - With the knowledge of a 19-year-old? But I'd like to. I could live on my own, alone on an island. I'd need nothing more. I'd die in three days maybe, but it wouldn't matter... It would matter. Having people, there has to be someone. But reaching the point where I couldn't care less, and if it's not that I'd burn the world down. When you'll burn down your shit column. You'll have no concrete column, nothing. It's my island. Your island won't exist, you'll set fire to it. But you're the master, you created it, but even so, you don't like it. - What the hell are you doing? - Who cares? - Who cares? - Who? It's your bloody island. I'd live on my own and no one would care. Great, you don't give a damn about what you create. Why is it my duty to do something for society? - Society is fucking me up. - You form part of society. We are society. - What if I don't want to be? - You can't, you are society, mate. But I couldn't live here. I'd have to live elsewhere. Imagine I go to Sierra Morena, I build my mud hut or whatever and I live alone. No one would care, no one would find me, there are miles of land... When did you meet Silvio? - About four or five years ago. - In second year of secondary school. I knew lots of people, but from the start, I knew there was something about him. And he gradually became my best friend. Would you say that Silvio has influenced you? Very much, I've thought about it and we've talked about the fact we're total opposites. He's really extrovert, he's forever getting up to all sorts. I'm exactly the opposite, I'm really shy, really quiet and really calm. I'm always relaxed and chilled out. We complement one another, so to speak. You live with the people you choose. People who bring you good things and all that stuff about "life" I guess. You stick with those who've been good to you, you steer clear of the rest, and you carry on with your life. And those who've been good to you might still be your friends in 20 years' time or things may change, you might live abroad. Life changes from one day to the next. And in 20 years' time, even more so. I don't know what I'll be doing tomorrow, it doesn't cross my mind, or what I'll be doing in 20 years' time. I don't know. I've no idea. 20TH JUNE 2018 I'll follow you. - Good afternoon. - We're being interviewed for... - Does this work...? - Slate in, please. Slate in... I think it's going well. In a hospital doing an internship, and I'm doing it as part of the vocational course, you have to do something. Anyway, I'm finishing next Friday, I've been in this hospital since September and I'll kill myself if I stay there. With this weather, who would bring a book? This is no time for studying really. - What exam do you have? - English. I failed it, because I'm an idiot, but anyway... - Weren't you a PE teacher? - Not at all, mate. - Is it all a lie? - Couldn't be further from the truth. Well, you're a good actor, hell... They tell us that the future is no good, that there won't be any work, - that we're all going to be fucked... - You have to learn it! The one about us being fucked is the next one, stop fucking with people, Silvio. - Okay, again from the start. - I've got it. Learn the other. Have you learned the other one? - The other's perfect. - Okay, show me the other. I'll sing you the other one later, we'll practice it now. But, who's stopping us? "Words that leave a mark their word is sacred like an... for the man who gave me life thank my mother for having conceived me back then my nine most pleasant months were in her tummy it doesn't matter what they do or what they say the damage is already done, the wounds confirm it my conscious is rotten because of lies memories aren't forgotten, at most they are recycled if not you come to a standstill, if not you don't move forward a long stride, trying to leave a mark I don't give a fuck, I'm not looking back enjoy the moment and carpe diem and tomorrow only God knows my mind wants to talk nonsense yet put itself to the test I'm the big shot here, and Trueba's the one with the balls Who's stopping us isn't over, this has only just begun and I hope you'll consider me for the next film even as an extra." Kisses for everyone out there, for those who aren't here, for those who aren't coming back, for my family, my mates, I couldn't give a shit about the rest. What a family... It came out shit but I couldn't give a fuck. Really, life is like a song Some sing it better and others worse We're just fictional characters With my mouth I can say lots of things But my eyes can say more If you know Look at me and you'll hear And if you want to enjoy yourself I know a place It's by the sea It's great Well anyway, good afternoon everyone, like... I don't know, we're Aguilar and Gato and this one's called "The First", flat out punk, I don't give a shit. Go for it. One, two, one, two, three... I spend all day stuck at home The fucking police won't let me out I'm bloody sick of sitting around The door is closed They won't let me open it I'm going to break down the door I'm going to escape From this fucking society It's all so dirty I can't see Nobody will ever stop us again Come, come, come up close Join the fight for your freedom Come, come, find out more We're going to break down this system Flowers don't grow in my garden The sun doesn't want to shine anymore We're left with a cloudy and grey day Full of prejudice and evil Nobody is ever happy here Nobody has gone back to being happy You're doing something really wrong So, why don't you all just die? Hey, good day. Well, here we are to ask who's stopping us? Yeah, we're young, and so what, if we don't have a fucking idea about life? They're just going to fuck us over, who gives a shit? You know what? All you need to do is dream. Everyone out there, all of you, you all have dreams. Who the fuck is going to tell you that you can't do it? Nobody. Nobody, do you know why? Because nobody, absolutely nobody is stopping us. So, everyone out there, come out to the street, come out to the street with me. Raise your hands and shout, who's stopping us? Because, who's stopping us? Nobody's stopping us! Who's stopping us? Who's stopping us? Nobody's stopping us Nobody's stopping us I can't breathe They don't let me fight They don't let us shout I can't express myself They don't let us live They don't let me fight Who's stopping us? Who's stopping us? More punk than a dead baby. I love you, beauties. - Oh my... - That was awesome. Great job, mate. - You were absolutely awesome. - Thanks. I have to go and introduce someone, don't I? Who's stopping us? Who's stopping us? Who's stopping us? Nobody's stopping us Who's stopping us? Who's stopping us?

Who's stopping us? Who's stopping us? Who's stopping us? Who's stopping us? Nobody. That's why we're here. Thank you. TWO YEARS LATER - How are you? - I got my hair cut. Yeah, mate, you look good. Super-hot. Real handsome. And I've shaved, I look like a baby now. - Hello... - How are you? - Good, yeah. - Hey. Hi, darling. - Hi, Claudia. - Hi, Candela. Hi, Claudia. We can't hear you. Hello? - Now. - Okay, hey guys, how are you? - Hello. - Hello, Marta. What's up? Where are you, Gavira? You've gone. Here. Shit! Look what I've done, my hair has grown loads and I shaved it like a Mohawk in two parts, to make like a big mohican, but I've also got this hair too. Sorry I'm late, I was doing stuff for class and all of that, I'm up to... This year is a lost cause, isn't it? I've got it back on track and I'm doing three times as much now. Hello, Rony. - Hey! - Hi. - Hello, Javi. - Can you hear me? - Yes. - Sorry for the interruption. No worries. One thing that Claudia mentioned was the feeling we all have that time is running out. Definitely, I took my gap year the year I could. Definitely. And Silvio, you also... I think remote working and schooling is going to be the future, and I personally prefer it because I get distracted really easily. When we're in class we tend to waste more time than make good use of it. I didn't do any of the elective classes, because of course, if I have the choice between class or playing Minecraft... I'm sorry but I'm just not getting involved. People like me with zero notion of responsibility, well we're lost causes, but you know, it's natural selection, I accept my extinction with dignity. For example, I have a rubbish internet connection and most of the calls I made... I don't mean calls, I mean classes... well, the connection kept cutting out. I did them on videocalls with my friend, she'd play the audio and I'd listen, it's totally absurd, but if it hadn't been for that I'd have left my computer there and I wouldn't have gone to class because I couldn't hear it, and through this I realised how important it is, at least for me, to have friends and people around you, and how important it is to have a teacher in front of you, Being able to look at the teacher's eyes when they're talking gets through to me a lot more than watching a screen does, I mean I still watch the classes but it's not the same. I wasn't exactly expecting to make a new group of friends or anything... I didn't know whether I'd get on well with them as they were quite a bit older than me, and in the end it was an awesome group, and I got on really well with them and we'd get drunk and do shit together, it was like the perfect group then goodbye group and that was it. And I'd also met a girl who I was starting to have a kind of relationship with as well, but that went to shit too, I was just beginning to make really cool relationships, then lockdown happened and here I am. I have friends and relatives who I normally see and things are great, and now with this situation where you can't see them, and you can't do video calls due to a bad internet connection etc., well there's a lot more tension and they get angry, and there are misunderstandings because people interpret text messages in their own way and it's getting a bit... I think that what happens at our age is the opposite of maturity, there are loads of passionate relationships in the end, a lot of Romeo and Juliet, a lot of contact, and this has all been a bit of a blow to the romantic passionate love that young people live for these days. You go from spending all of your time with your partner to only speaking over the phone, you know, and for a lot of people things just wavered out. Yeah, that's a good metaphor... I think this situation is shaking the foundations of our relationships or the relationships people have. I mean, I think it is really bringing to light new ways of understanding relationships. I think there are a lot of people who place a lot of importance on seeing each other every day, on chatting every day, on these types of things, and given that the current circumstances prevent you from doing that, well, I think it is really testing the foundations of a lot of relationships, when it should be more personal, not so universal, the idea of seeing each other every day and chatting every day. At the end of the day you get to know the person more because you can't have that physical contact with them and so the only thing you can do is talk, because that's all that's left... You can't just throw them down on the bed. I don't mean that couples didn't use to talk that much, but if there was any awkward silence the solution was physical contact, whereas now you have to think of where to go from there, you know? Whenever there was awkward silence, you'd just snog them, but now... - Exactly! - It's true. I get what you're saying. I'm okay in the sense that I don't feel like things are weird or anything... obviously we all have weird days but my partner was the person who I spent the most time with and suddenly it's really odd, as while they are still there all day it's not the same and it's really strange. But I won't go to sleep at night unless I've chatted to her, because I can't, I need her to tell me she is okay, today I've done this and that, that's all, I mean, I did three exercises, and I ate cereal and that's great. It's like, thanks for telling me, I needed to know that, I needed to know that you're okay, I need to see you, I need to know that you are still you and that you still see me in the same way. I thought I'd cope better, but the time goes on and... Now I don't remember what you smell like, I don't remember what it is to hug you, I don't remember what it is touch you, I'm forgetting it all and I don't like it one bit. In my current situation it's as if I have to reconsider love and responsibility, and, I don't know, it's like a sort of epic battle between what I love and hate most, and my responsibilities of course. That's really beautiful. The applause. - We've got to go out to the balcony. - You're right. - Keep your heads up. - See you soon. - Guys. - Chin up. - Bye. - Chins up. Don't lose heart. How do you hang up? A PAST AND A FUTURE (AND END) Yeah, do you remember? It was cold, wasn't it? It was pretty cold but there was a beautiful sunset, I don't know if we arrived in time to record it, but there was a beautiful sunset up there on the waste ground. - Yeah. - I don't know if I've told you but it's the place I go to for spiritual exile, so to speak. For example, during lockdown, it was exactly that, when they finally let us go out for a walk or whatever, in the late evening, almost night time... And that was the best part of the day, going out for a walk on my own, listening to music, and I hardly saw anyone as it was almost night time, and I'd just go up to the hill and stay there for ten minutes, or fifteen or half an hour. I remember one day it was raining, there was nobody in the street and I was wandering around without an umbrella or anything, I was getting absolutely soaked and my boots were drenched, but I hadn't felt that calm in so long, because I had been stuck inside all day, doing work in front of the screen all day, so being able to go out for a short while at night and head up to that waste ground, that hill and sit there looking at the nothingness with the rain coming down was super relaxing. And now I associate this waste ground with the tranquillity it gave me. That's it. You're going to vote. To vote for the first time. I don't know, it's weird seeing these types of things, people touching the papers, everyone without masks... people giving each other hugs. I mean, it's normal, but it's crazy to see these things not knowing when it will go back to this, because we really don't know. I find it scary, you know? Wondering when will we go back to having the freedom that we used to have? - Hello. - Hello, how are you? - Hoyos, Peinado... - Pablo? Pablo. White. Yellow. - Thanks very much. - Thanks. - See you. - Bye. - Hello. Gonzalo Blasco. - Hello. Thanks, and the envelopes too, please. Thanks. Navarro, Claudia. - Four, six, four. - There you go. - Thanks. - Thanks. Silvio Aguilar Torres. - ID. - Yes, ID. Silvio Antonio Aguilar Torres. - Thanks very much. - Have a good day. - Bye. - Bye. It's quite overwhelming but it's true that there is suddenly a feeling that this vote was more important then than it seems now. Although it seems contradictory with everything that's happening, you say politics, decisiveness and awareness is what matters right now, now is the time, but at the same time, right now, I feel like it was a really insignificant or trivial moment, like I was doing it without knowing I'd be confined to my house the following year and that moment wasn't going to mean as much. And at the same time everything that's going on at home and the decisions that are being made, it all has to do with that moment. That my neighbourhood was under lockdown and not another, a couple of months ago... it all has to do with that moment. Hello, good afternoon. Recio, Gil, Candela. - Zero, four, fifty-six. - Zero, four, fifty-six. The blue one here. - And the white one here. - Thanks very much. - Thank you. - Have a nice day. Bye. Do you remember? It was a bit before this. It's the 20th June. Well, here we are to ask who's stopping us? Yeah, we're young, and so what if we don't have a fucking idea about life? They're just going to fuck us over, who gives a shit? You know what? All you need to do is dream. Everyone out there, all of you, you all have dreams. Who the fuck is going to tell you that you can't do it? Nobody, do you know why? Because nobody, absolutely nobody's stopping us. So, everyone out there, come out to the street, come out to the street with me. Raise your hands and shout, who's stopping us? Because, who's stopping us? Nobody's stopping us! It's upsetting, it's like... what has happened to us? Our generation... well, I guess this will affect all generations in a way, no matter what stage they are at in their lives, I think it has hit ours especially hard and it will continue to do so. All this has happened precisely when we're receiving our education, and we are beginning to become more adult, more independent, more us. And suddenly this period of your life in which you are beginning to develop as a person is proving much more difficult because you can't leave home, you can't study or get decent training, and looking for a job right now is impossible... It's impossible for a young student to find a job, leave home, travel, or take a year out to do whatever they want... It's as though these opportunities have been taken away from my generation. In a way it's not a bad thing, it's like... well, that's it, this is who we are, isn't it? We had to be defined by something, and it has happened precisely at a time in which we are still impressionable, I'm not saying that people aren't impressionable the rest of their lives, but it is during their youth when it is really possible to mould a generation. The fact that this has happened to us right now could have a real impact on how we understand future life, given that we are the ones who will lead the world in the future and we have been caught up in this, when we aren't yet anything, rather in the process of becoming something, which will define how the world will change in coming years... Can you hear me? AUTHOR OF THE SONG WHO'S STOPPING US AND THE COLLABORATION OF MANY MORE... MANY THANKS FOR HAVING FAITH IN US
