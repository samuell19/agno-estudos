Mosfilm Studio Circle Creative Association After 17 months and 7 days, the ark came to rest on the greatest of mountains: Ararat. And after the third dove returned with an olive branch in its beak, Noah threw open the ark's doors, stepped out onto the grass, spread his arms to the sun, and loudly proclaimed: "ASSA" ASSA? ASSA! ASSA is the only word surviving from those antediluvian times. Its strength and purity was also carried to us. Screenplay by Sergei Livnev and Sergei Solovev Cinematographer Pavel Lebeshev Art Director Marksen Gauchman-Sverdlov Composer Boris Grebenshchikov Sound Operator Ekaterina Popova Assistant Director Victor Trakhtenberg Cameramen Yuri Yakovlev and Yuri Kobzev Costume Designer Irina Gino Makeup Artist Irina Sarkisova Editor Vera Kruglova Production Manager Vladimir Dupin Sergei Bugaev, also known as "Africa" Tatyana Drubich Stanislav Govorukhin In a film by Sergei Solovev ASSA Part One I once tried to call a girl in the morning, but the phone just rang and rang. Suddenly a little boy, no bigger than a matchbox, climbed out of the phone. I was very scared, and I asked "Who are you?" He climbed into a glass, got drunk, and while jumping on the couch answered, "I'm the Bananan boy" Tu-tu-tu Hello Bananan boy! Hello Bananan boy! Hello Bananan boy! He climbed onto my old sofa, and told me that he was an orphan. He used to have a Bananan dad, but now only has a mother-telephone. And soon he's gonna go far away because he can't live like this. And I thought, "It's not easy to sit and do" Sit and do Tu-tu-tu Hello, Bananan boy Hello, Bananan boy Hello, Bananan boy Hello. Excuse me, Have you seen Bananan boy? No! Hello! Please, is Bananan boy there? No! Hey, answer the phone black man! Hello! Is Bananan boy there? No, isn't he with you? No! I'm sorry, hang on a minute Yes! He's here! Hello, Bananan boy! Hello, Bananan boy! Hello, Bananan boy! Hello, Bananan boy! Hello, Bananan boy! How many did you say fit in here? 120 containers on the bottom, and you can put more on top. On top? How many more on top? Almost half. And how many tons is that? I don't know. I'd have to calculate it. Got it. And during the winter, you say it's almost empty in here? Almost always Ok, thank you. "I'd have to calculate..." I'd need to calculate it. If, suddenly, a friend turned out to not be a friend, but neither an enemy, well... Have you heard whether we will dock at Yalta? No. I don't think so. What are you? A Major? Major Why? What do you mean? It's an ordinary army rank. Why not Lieutenant? Comrade, it's hard for me to answer your questions. I'm very seasick. I've already vomited all over this ship. Let's go. You could even dress up as a generalissimo, I swear... Go, go and find your room. Hold your tongue! What room? We ought to be nicer to each other, Comrade. Sit down and don't dare you drink any more. Got it? What? Stop drinking? N. Eidelman "The Edge of Centuries" Publishing House "Idea" March 10, 1801 Midday in St. Petersburg It seemed that Emperor Pavel's greatest dream came true. He is the Tsar, and was staying at Mikhailovsky Palace for the first time among the sentries, walls, and the fog. But for some reason, the Tsar didn't feel happy. Was it an ominous premonition, the silence from the courtiers, the sullen faces of his wife and sons? Who knows? Who knows...? Mama! Mama! Mom, honestly how much longer can this go on? Mom, I'm not a child anymore. No, the boat can't dock here. What? Mom what south? It's snowing here. At the seaport. I'm telling you, I will spend the night in port. That's all! Oh Lord! Well? What now? What? Pardon me. But we can't understand why an intelligent person would spend the night here. May we introduce ourselves? This is Vitya. My friend Vitya. Why are you so shy? Is it because he's black? Don't worry. He's our Negro. Soviet, socialist! You could say that you've seen a new kind of Negro. Not Michael, not Joe, mind you, but Vitya. He's a direct result of the detente. Just ordinary Vitya. Hey you really are Vitya, ya? Yes, I'm Vitya. Not a Michael or a Joe? I'll tell you a worse story. They caught a foreigner in Leningrad who was bringing a suitcase full of snakes into Russia. And I'm sorry, what's your name? Alika. Strange name. Not that strange. Just a dumb name, that's all. Mom wanted to call me Alexandra, and my father, Lika, so they compromised on Alika. Crazy. Like any compromise, though. They call this the Black Sea. Here's where you can get some hospitality. Mom, relax, they're with me. Hello Tom's mom. Hello, Vitya. Look what a great lodger we brought you! Just for the night, while they wait out the storm. Come in. The bathroom's clean and the sheets are fresh. Down duvet. "KVN" television. All just for three rubles. Give me your shirt, and I'll wash it for you. You're welcome. Here. Ok, thank you very much. The Moor did his job, the Moor can leave now. What are you doing? Grabbing food and running again? I'm drinking milk. Drinking milk... Go and eat. I left food on the table for you. Always running. You already have gastritis, you'll end up with an ulcer. "Land of mine, country of mine... favorite of mine." Mom... Stars... What are you doing there? Look, a cat. Bring her over. Her eyes glow in the dark. You and your friend are funny. You could perform in the circus. Which of his parents is black? His mom? Dad? His dad. He was a national hero in Angola. I pity his father. He died in a dungeon. And what's your name? Bananan? Who's song was that? Yours? I actually work as a night watchman at the theater. Drink, drink. We have a great hall there. Can record, listen. Delete, record again. Do you want to compose something together? On the road from Shvarzvalburhaus to Grimingsvilinger, and in Germany, a city's importance is inverse to the size of its name, The great Geothe stopped in a small tavern for three weeks. What's this for? You'll light the way for us. Anyways, having gone for a walk through the picturesque surroundings of a completely uninhabited area... Hang on, it's not lighting. On return to the tavern, he discovered, to his amusement, that the only representative of the fairer sex was the owner's idiot servant. Deaf, mute, and crippled, she was indifferent to the great romantic's ardor. For three weeks Niobe, a creature with significant signs of facial degredation, remained indifferent to the great Goethe. But we should thank her for the magical, unrequited love that pervades the genius play "Faust". The flame's too weak, it can't even light the way. Don't say that. If we each light a match, there will be enough light. What is this? The theater. Who's playing? Good, kind people. Just very small people. Can you learn lyrics? Well enough. Keep in mind, it's complicated. You need to say "no" three times. Then "six", followed by "female". What is this? A Japanese computer, a Yamaha. It's pretty cool. You like it? A new object appears in my field of view A new object appears in my field of view. Coming at you! Coming at you! Is that a cupboard? No! Is it a table? No! What's your number? Six! What's your gender? Female! It came for you! It came for you! A new object appears in our field of view A new object appears in our field of view Where did you get this piece of junk? The Germans abandoned it during the retreat. What Germans? During what retreat? You know, the one in '43. Three generations have driven this car. I've put in a new super engine. Took forever. But it's a dream, not a car. Why are you in such a rush? Who's on the ship? The prince of Denmark? Yes. Hurry up. Don't cry, baby! All is normal! Hello. Could you please look for a reservation under my name? Yes, I have you in room 301. Has Andrei Valentinovich Krimov arrived? He is in 302. He checked you in. Here you go. Take this, I'll wait for you here. Hello Marshenka! I'm in Yalta. I feel great. No nausea. I'm taking my medicine. Did they leave a message for me? Yes, yes. I understand. If there's any news we'll talk. Love you. Bye. Oh, Andryushenka. Forgive me, I overslept like a fool. I was so worried I didn't know what to think. Where did you stay? I rented a room. Three rubles. The storm lasted all night. Nobody knew when the ship would get in. Everything was covered in snow! I left your things in there. Hey wait, take this. Pour us a coffee for our hard-earned money Boy, are you a local? Yes. There's no more rooms in the hotel. I need a place to stay. Can you help me? Yeah, sure. I've got a room for you. You can use the TV. A new detective series starts today. Thank you. And what is this? Iron curtain. Pardon? An iron curtain. Come on, I'll show you to your room. I only have 25 rubles. Don't worry, I'll find change. Please don't whistle in the house. Do you lock up at night? I ask because I like to walk in the dark. I generally don't give guests keys. Don't forget to lock the front door. And please don't make any noise during the night. What noise? I'll be quiet as a mouse. I'll dive into my hole and disappear. Let's pretend you bet evens. Maybe 22, or red. If, for example, it lands on odds, or black, or zero, then the dealer wins. You can't imagine how cold my head gets during the winter. Then you should wear a hat! I'll give you my permission. Hello? Volodya, is that you? Yes, it's me. I need the double bass. In a case. No, no. In a case Volodya, not in a bag. I'm ashamed to even say what. It's an old, terrible musical number. But maybe original because of it. I met Albert. Yes, yes, the smoker. He's alive. Very well, I'll bring the bass myself to the meeting. Goodbye. Why do you need a double bass? I love classical. Mozart, Sarasate, Verdi or for example let's say Pushkin. You know what I like most about Onegin? What he does with the simplest words. Listen: Dusk falls, the samovar sits on the table, boiling, and warmed the Chinese teapot; steam curled beneath it. Olga's hand guides the perfumed tea into its cups in a dark stream. Meanwhile a servant passes round the cream. Tatiana hovers by the cold window, breathing on the frosted pane. She's lost deep in thought, and traces with her finger on the glass, the cherished letters O and E You see. Such simple words. They seem like nothing, but they are everything. Let's have lunch. The last time I met Albert, she wasn't even born. He was organizing his wedding, and everyone loved the bride's name. Zoya, Zoya. There's something medieval in the name. Alchemical... Do you remember Albert? Medieval? I don't know. I used to think that. Zoya is an ancient Greek name. It means life. That is true, yes. For 25 years, Zoya has been my whole life. Andrei, congratulate us! Our grandson was born yesterday. They called and told us. A boy, 54 centimeters long! Congradulations! Unbelievable. And our son is in the army now. And tell me, how are you? Are you really giving it all to Sylvia? Yes, we are. I remember the blue sea, the cries of seagulls, the sound of the surf. We were alone on the wild rocks. We were just like children. I kissed these hands. I caressed these curls. How painful it is in the evening hour longing. To remember joking is fatal. But I didn't lie to you. No, believe me I am always yours. The days of sadness came. Parting was difficult. So many words, we said it all, and love Love abandoned us. Do you remember how happiness smiled on us as we swore to love each other forever. We are bound by this captivating power. Can we forget our love? No, no you are only mine. And I am only yours. You were tied to another then, expectations died and melancholy set in, Old flames call us and we cannot forget them. Do you remember? Do I remember? No, no you are mine again. And I, yes, am yours! Workers at the Lipetsk Car Factory have taken on new obligations to increase productivity Oh, how tired I am with all of this! What factory productivity? The more you work, the less you get paid. Change the channel. Oh. Stop here! The game is called "Bangladesh". I made it myself. Think of a number. I did. Likewise. What was your number? Seven. Seven? I have eight. I win. I can't imagine how you'll carry this case. Easily. Come and find me later. I'm going for a walk. Don't get wet, and find something to eat. To Simferopol, please. Goodbye. To the train station at Simforopol. What do you think, will we get through the pass? I'm sorry for the ruble thing earlier. Why are you making a big deal about it? I already spent it on a coffee. Look. What is it? I started to write a book. This is a draft. What is it about? The history of all living things. From single-celled organisms to modern day events Inflammable! Unsinkable! What's with the book, guys? An eternal book, old man. A great one. Yeah? Does it work? Superbly. It'll survive even through a worldwide catastrophe. I experimented. If there is a worldwide catastrophe, then you and I would be dead. Oh, why do I feel so awful? I don't feel any better. I anticipated this moment. When you feel sad, listen to this cassette. What caused you to decide that I ought to be so sad? Just seemed that way to me. And do you know how hard it is for me, how tough? I live with my mother. For the last eight years. Eight years, I've been taking care of her for eight years. Do you want to play Bangladesh? What is it? A good game. I invented it myself. Think of a number. Nineteen. And I chose twenty. I won. Andrei! I want to ask for a favor. Do you know what it's cost me to live like this for the past 25 years? I was threatened. But I stood strong. You never denounced me for leaving. Maybe the only one. Your word was decisive. Thanks to you, I was left alone. I'm grateful to you. Andrei, help me one more time. I owe money. You don't know about it. Nobody else does either. The only one who knew, died a long time ago. I had forgotten about it. I have a different life now. Different debts. Different morals. Everything is different. And now that terrible debt has surfaced. And you cannot imagine how it grew. Today I met with... I know he's here. He's demanding that I pay him. You need to pay him then, Albert. I can't! I don't have anything I can give! Allow me to speak formally. Confidentially even. Please. Your Highness, allow me to ask for your wife's hand in marriage. Forgive me! I meant your niece! You've lost your mind! Stacey is madly in love with Edwin. She would never agree to this marriage. Let's find out right now. You want to ask her over the phone? No! Over the gramophone! Alright, I'll look into it. Why are you so upset? Albert, don't beat yourself up over it. Tomorrow let's go on a trip. Relax. You can bring your wife. It will be a nice, fun time. Two old friends. I will disappear for a bit, and you can see if anyone follows. Do you have a camera? Andrei, I'm begging you. Oh and also... Hide this somewhere. Where's Edwin? What Edwin? My son Edwin! Oh, that one. What? He's in the cafe. You should have said so sooner. Are you going to call him with the phone? No, with the gramophone! I don't understand what we're talking about. Really. What nonsence. Come here Albert. What? Try to fit inside. What for? Just try, try... Like that, go on. Yes. Like that, fantastic! We'll take the double bass, and carry it into the orchestra. The violin I need is called 'Gvarneri'. You're a smart man. You won't make a mistake. And your debt will disappear. You will be a completely free man. Hey, can I ask you to play something about us pilots? Something great? The Air Force remembers favors. Thank you Comrade. Let's play guys. VVS – VVS Military Air Force VVS A sphere of special consideration. VVS. A universal vehicle. A universal vehicle... On a night flight there is so much room. Fantastic weather and an altitude of ten thousand, five hundred. Our pilots... Glorious boys... The sky is their home, they don't get sad looking down on the world from above. Would the lady like to dance? Michael. Ludmila. Sasha, behave yourself! A sphere of special attention. VVS A universal vehicle. A universal vehicle. Today they have a holiday. It's just a game. The hard part is long gone. The pilots are quiet, looking at the stars. The exercise was successful. Everyone is smiling. VVS VVS Military Air Force. VVS A sphere of special attention. VVS A universal vehicle. A universal vehicle. VVS Art is higher than love. The poetry of a mature search. Who are they, the participants of the last parade? Normal guys... Who conquered the skies before anyone else. Go away. VVS VVS You go away! VVS Hey. Nothing serious, nothing serious. Get back up. Please. Pardon us ladies, our deepest apoliges for the mess. It's nothing. Comrades, I was drunk. Get down Major. I was drunk. I apologize. Your overcoat please. I formally apologize Ludmila. I apologize completely. I wasn't sober. I was drunk! This conduct is unbecoming of an officer! I was drunk! He'll get what's coming. I beg your forgiveness, Comrades! Yes, we have an entire cultural program. An evening of contemporary music, theater. How long are you staying? Two weeks if the tour is not extended. But the city is empty, so it probably won't be. You should come nonetheless. We'll perform 'Sylvia'. Would you excuse me for a moment? Let's go and say hi, Andryiusha. I've wanted to introduce you for a while. This is Bananan. Nanaban! Krimov, Andrei Valentinovich. By the way, I wanted to apologize for that ruble. Do you want me to return it? What do you want me to say Albert? You and I, frankly speaking, are far from being young people. I never used to need a phone book. Like the doctors say, it's sclerosis, age. You know when a patient arrives and says, 'Doctor, I have memory loss?' 'Since when?' 'What do you mean when?' 'Your memory loss.' 'What memory loss?' Good afternoon, dear viewers! We are reporting live from Nikitsky Botanical Gardens. Our garden looks unusual. All the subtropical plants are covered in snow. Catch! Farewell. Goodbye, Albert. Such snowstorms are very harmful to subtropical plants. Some collapse, most break, twisting at the roots. Others die from the cold and frost. Palm trees in the snow look very original. Then what happened? There. The ship arrived quietly this morning. If I heard everything then it wasn't that quiet. The steamer gave three long hoots. Ready! I think I blinked! Let's do it again. That's good. Ok, good. On the ship you can't really walk around. Sturgeon sandwiches. Careful here. And in the evening, after sundown, it gets unbelievably quiet. That's all. I don't understand. The beared guy is "Round". It would seem so, yes. It appears that way. They said he was bald as a knee. Hell, who knows. He may be wearing a disguise. Alright, fine. What about Swan? To the exit. Forward. Stop. Face the wall. Let's go. Stop. Come through. Open... Slowly the gates... With permission? Yes. Come in. Come in, sit down. Thank you. Did you cut your hair? Yes. I did it myself. More hygienic this way. Shall we continue? I already told you everything. I was drunk. My behavior was unworthy of a Soviet officer. I offer my apologies. Stop playing the fool, it's moronic. Where did you get the uniform? Uniform? Well alright, so let's say I lied. Let's say I'm not an officer. But I wanted to be. I dreamed about flying so many times. I've taken off and landed. I flew into the open cosmos... and soared. Then, one day, I was sleeping and I heard on the radio that he had died. When I woke up in the kitchen, I immediately knew it was true. That the first man in space had died. Gagarin was gone! I cried, I cried but I knew that I didn't want to be the first astronaut. I'm not an idiot! Yuri is unique! Titov, on the other hand, beautiful, intelligent. slim, fit, smart. When I looked at myself in the mirror, I saw we were physically identical. Everything was the same! Even height! Weight! Except for one thing. The tiny letters on the entry form! Tiny and blue! What? What difference do they make? Tell me! No? Then I refuse to speak! Then I absolutely protest! I demand that you write: "The prisoner expresses his protest". His strongest protest! Not another word. Stop acting like an idiot, Babakin. It's tedious and unecessary. Not to me, and not to you. Here. Read this. I apologize. I wasn't sober. Do you know Swan? Swan? Swan? What kinds of ham do you have? The usual. Yugoslavian? I should. Alright, then two portions. Do you have lemons? I think so. Cut them. Just don't sprinkle them with sugar. And there's no soup? What, soup at midnight? Ok, some broth instead. And roast chicken, not boiled. Roast it. Oh hey, what are you doing here? - Does your mom work here? - No. Are there water cures? What for? Andrei needs one. Are you with daddy? Why are you embarrassed? I'm not. He's pretty cool. I'll go say hi. Hello! And then whatever you think best. You want that ruble back? And a coffee too. i have a request. Play for an hour for us. I know everything's closed, but... Name your price. I hope I haven't offended you. [Мочалкин Блюз plays] [Mochalkin Blues plays] I'd love to scoff at every babe. My foot heavy on the pedal. And sing my, my funky tune. Mochalkin blues. Oh, I want to rip off all their clothes. Tear off their wigs, and platform shoes. Hey ladies, come running right away, because I'm singing the Mochalkin Blues. I'm a smooth one, the coolest of all dudes. If you let me, I'll seduce you. So come on honey, jump on into my bed. Just let me sing the Mochalkin Blues... [in German] One... two... three... What's this? Change. We could only drink 20 rubles worth. Not 100. Did you write that song? Of course. From an ironic series about Kozlodoyev. Kozlodoyev? Who is he? You'll find out. Another time.

Did something happen? No, nothing. Don't worry. You came to hang out? No. I'm here on business. Then something happened. I already said nothing did. Yet. But we need to talk about something. Alright then, let's talk. Let's talk. I'll meet you at our place. At one o'clock. We shouldn't be seen. Try not to draw attention when you come. Good luck, Arkasha. Adieu. Adieu, papa. A little closer, comrades. But not in front of each other. Everyone should be able to see the camera. Ready... Cheese! Crimea, 1980 And again! And again! How does the work on your book go? I just finished a chapter on Winston Churchill. It's called "Inhuman heights and unseen depths". If you are normal, then you live an unnatural life. Classy. I don't live life. Living to live is sad. Work ‒ Home. Work ‒ Grave. I live in the secret world of my dreams. And life? What is life? Real life is just a window that I occasionally look through. And what do you see? Not much. A lot of dregs. I worked as a nurse in Orly. An ambulance brought him from the hotel. It was my shift. He later told me that he was lonely, getting older, and he wanted to settle down. How so? Have a wife, kids. But not now. Later. Why later? Then he told me that he like me, and I imagined what my life could be. Who's that? That's my favorite signer, Nick Cave. And Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space. And this is a "communication tube". What? Communication tube. Sit down. For example, if you want to share some emotional concerns about life, we move the tube to "position number 1". You speak into it, and I'll listen. Go on, say something. What do I say? Well, for example what's up with you and your guy? With Krimov? Did you fall asleep? I love him. For three years now he called me every night. Now we're together again, and neither of us want to leave. Fantastic. Let's move it to "position number 2". Put your ear there, and I'll speak now. Catherine II corresponded with Voltaire for quite a long time. Can you hear me ok? Yes. It's true by the way. They wrote to each other for quite a while, and kept diaries of their conversations. Other famous women kept diaries too, but not everyone. The Revolution changed everything. And? Oh. Simply expressing my thoughts. For my book. Why are we talking about Catherine II? Why Krimov? If it rains, it'll get wet. I'll sew a special bag. Plastic. With a string. Here you go. Natrium carbonicum. Baking soda. An amazing picture of life. Palm trees in the snow. Yalta in the winter. Do you like the pipe? It's good. It's all yours. Three months of summer. Eternal spring Do you want an apple? No. Take this. What is it? Photobooth. A gift. Look at it when you want. What about our Generalissimo? Shitty business, dad. Sitting in prison. We need to get him out. Easy for you to say. We need to bribe someone. They won't take it. Too many or afraid? Both. Son, you can't be greedy. Give them what they ask for. Rich people are different. Adieu, papa. Hello. Hi. What's that? A gift. "Communication tube". It's pretty cool. Communication what? I don't get it. Communication tube. For example, say you want to tell me something intimate. Sit down. We bring the tube to "position number 1" You speak there. My ear goes here. Say something! By the way, tomorrow is our third anniversary We should celebrate, but we need to do it right. Your friends and my friends. I'll ask Albert and Zoe. How about you? Guys, it's snowing on deck. I don't get it. Why are we here? That man gives us money. He's footing it. He pays, sure. But then Bananan gives it back as change. Let's wrap ourselves up, or we'll really freeze to death. Let's go upstairs, it's uncomfortable here. Come on, c'mon, pull it over. You've still got it. This was very important to know. What did you decide? I talked to him. Nothing can be done Albert. If you can't repay the debt, you'll have to help us somehow. I understand and sympathize with you, but if it makes it easier, imagine you're doing it because not to pay off the debt, but rather because you like me and we are friends. We'll start with the double bass. Understand that I don't need any random violinist. I need you. Understand? Just you. Andrei, this is cruel. So what? Life is cruel. Don't debase yourself Albert. It won't change anything, and will only ruin our friendship. Friendship... [Старик Козлодоев plays] [Old Kozlodoyev plays] Old man Kozlodoyev crawls on the roof. As smooth as a corncrake. Trying to squeeze through someone's window, into some woman's bed. But Kozlodoyev used to wander around empty-eyed. With just a whistle, he called all the girls to make love love with him in the bushes. Kozlodoyev used to love sex, and satisfying a dozen women at once. He was a national icon , Kozlodoyev, and everyone respected him. But now, now, those bitches hide behind the windows of their apartments. And Kozlodoyev crawls along, his trousers wet, he's old; he wants the toilet. Is that song dedicated to me? Yeah. And did you like it? No. Oh Lord, why him? Go downstairs. Why? I'll check, make sure nothing was left behind. Why do you shave all the time? I don't like you seeing me unshaven. And why are you wearing a t-shirt? If you're cold, buy pyjamas. Only old people wear pyjamas, and I hope I'm not that old yet. Why don't you like this shirt? I feel like I'm sleeping with Pele. First, Pele was number 10. And second, you don't need to sleep with a footballer. Who cares? I sleep with a tennis player. I'm sorry. I don't know what's wrong with me. A poem by M. U. Lermontov. Six letters. What letter does it start with? With 'C'. Caucausus. That's it. Cau-casus. Listen, did you take Zoya away from the theater? Me? Why? Did you make sure there was nothing left behind? Nothing. What a pity. A quarter century I knew him. He's gone, and there's absolutely nothing leftover. It's a shame, no? The oldest street in Moscow. Five letters. Arabat. Correct. Arbat. End of Part One. Part Two. Break it open. Bullet here. There. Take aim. Taking aim. Where are you aiming? At the white light, looks like a penny. I've never been able to hit a target. I'm targeting the windmill. Then I've got the swing. Oops. Missed. And I hit it. It's because you don't wear the glasses. Put them on. They don't have lenses. The lenses aren't important. The idea is to feel like someone who can see. Aim a bit higher. To the right. I hit it! Now I'm aiming for the hare. PASSENGERS OPEN THE DOOR Jump in. And don't move around inside. Yes. South, and not too hot. What's so marvelous? It's winter. Hold one. [Город Золотой plays] [City of Gold plays] Under a blue sky stands a golden city. With transparent gates and a bright star. And in the city the garden has all kinds of flowers and herbs. And walking through the city, are animals of impossible beauty. One a yellow, flaming lion, the other an ox full of eyes. A heavenly, golden eagle flies above them, with an unforgettable stare. In the blue sky, one star burns bright. She's yours, my angel, you'll always see her from afar. Those who love, love, Those who shine, are blessed. Let the star show you the way, it will take you to that marvelous garden. There you'll meet the flaming lion, the ox of blue, with many eyes. And with them the golden eagle with an unforgettable shining gaze. At this table, it will soon become clear who knows, who suspects, and who will get caught up in this conspiracy.

Hold on... let's find out if it's true. Let's pay out here. Take it from his coat. The inside pocket. All of it? It'll be a ruble and a kopeck short. I'll have to pay you back. Wait a moment. I almost forgot. That was it. March 12, 1801. 2am in St. Petersburg. Your Imperial Majesty. What are you doing? How dare you? I never wanted nor ordered this. Your Majesty, now is not the time.

Not another minute than we have to. The ship leaves in 40 minutes. First to Batumi, then Odessa, and further, further. We'll decide then where to go.

He tracked me using a woman as cover. Well, I explained everything to you. I manged to shake him off our trail for a couple hours. What trail? I warned you that this could happen any day. So that you could be ready at any moment. You promised not to ask questions. Let's go. Let's go, eh? No. I'm not going anywhere. I was afraid of this. Oh you idiot, you cretin. What is he to you? Who is he? He's a damn boy! You yourself know that you'll forget him tomorrow. And he doesn't need you! He spit on you! You're an adult. I love you. I love you more than life. I have nothing, other than you. Nothing else that I love. Well? Let's go. No. Well then I'll tell you this much. He's gone. Dead. He died two hours ago. I'm telling you that he's nobody! Scum! You will never see him again, not even in a grave! Because he at the bottom of the sea, and nobody will look for him there. Why are you lying? You are humiliating yourself. You still have five minutes. This is not your coat. He gave it to me when I was cold. We need to return it to him. His real name was Andrei Valentinovich Krimov.

Should I answer it? Go ahead. Mom? Hello. What's wrong with my voice? Nothing. Just a little hoarse. Hoarse. It's freezing out, and I caught an awful cold. Yes, Mom. I already told you, I am not a child anymore. I understand. Understood. Ok. Bye. May I sit down? Go ahead. Can I play a cassette? Sure. I should probably get dressed. Ah. Of course. Apologies for this. Lena, help her. Let's go. [Чудесная Страна plays] [A Marvelous Land plays] Not too long ago, I traveled to a marvelous place. Where amber waves splatter on the reefs. Time has stood still in its shadowy gardens, and flamingo-hued clouds float through the sky. The river shines through emerald hills, You can go now. It's as splendid as a fairy tale, as profound as a dream. Waiting to catch the brilliant moon. What clothes do you want to take with you? The sweater. And the trousers.

Do you understand that you'll never find a more marvelous land? Do you understand that you'll never find a more marvelous land? But this isn't the end of the story.

To walk around the restaurant... [Хочу перемен plays] [I want changes! plays] Instead of warmth is green glass, smoke instead of fire. A day ripped from the calendar. The red sun burns down to ash, the day burns with it. Shadow falls on the burning city. Change! Our hearts demand it. Change! Our eyes demand it. In our laughter and in our tears, pulsing in our veins. Change! We're waiting for change. Electric light extends the day. The matchbox sits empty. In the kitchen, the gas light is blue.

In our laughter and in our tears, pulsing in our veins! Change! We're all waiting on change. We can't be proud of wise eyes, or skilled hands. We don't need it, to understand one another.
