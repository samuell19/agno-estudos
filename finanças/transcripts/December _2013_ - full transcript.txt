Do you have a girlfriend? Nope. Want to hold hands? Huh? Isn’t it heavy? No, it’s fine. You’re good at playing the guitar. Not really. Play for me next time, will you? The same song? No, something else. Come see me in five months. Five months? I practiced five months for that song. It really took you five months? Yeah. No way. Want to play a game? Yeah? What kind? Let’s play "Name That Snack". What? What do you got to lose? It’s really fun. Oh, alright. - I’ll start. - Yeah. Saewookkang. Jollypong. - Potato Stick. - Corn Chips. Onion... Onion Ring. Onion Ring? Wafer. Wafer? Wafer... It’s squared shaped and has cream inside. It’s pretty good. Oh, okay! Watch your step! I’ll go with Butter Ring. Ring again? You chose Onion Ring last time. Onion Ring with Ambasa is so delicious though. - If you say so. Pringles. - Pringles are a bit expensive. Yachae Cracker are a bit expensive too. Yachae Cracker aren't expensive. You must be kidding. I’m going to go with Custard. I didn’t know we could choose snacks that came in cardboard boxes. What does it matter? In that case, I’ll go with Saewookkang. Saewookkang? - You already chose that. - Spicy Saewookkang. That’s cheating! - Rice Saewookkang. - You can’t do that! Why? The wrapping is different. Look. Red is original, black is spicy, and white is rice. That’s not fair. You’re crossing the line. Just because it’s Saewookkang doesn’t mean it’s all the same. Think about it. I know this as a fact. I’ve worked at a convenient. Still it’s cheating. Yellow card! What are you doing? Wait. I’m waiting. Who’s this in the photo? Give it back! I don’t want you seeing it! Give it back! You didn’t have to come. No, I had to. The insurance company already took care of everything. I feel bad for what happened. There was so much stuff going on that day. I didn’t know what to do. How are you holding up? They say it’ll get better in two months. I can rest throughout the semester, thanks to you. Want some bread? I brought some. I’m hungry, you know. What do you do for a living? I draw. Are you an artist? In a way I am. I’m a children’s book illustrator. Why do you ask? That’s amazing. You give children hope and teach them moral values. I’m not sure I give them hope. But I know I don’t make them into responsible adults. No? I just want to draw. I don’t want to complicate them with facts and ideas. Reading is hard enough for them already. I see what you mean. What’s your major? Creative Writing. You must be good at writing. I’m not sure about that. It’s all in my head. I just have troubles expressing them sometimes. Well, what do you want to write about? I want to write something new. It’s hard to be unique. Yeah, I know. Can I have some milk? You should have told me earlier. This is the only one I have. It’s okay. I just want one sip. Looks like I drank it all. Well, there wasn’t a lot anyways. I better go now. You look like you could use some rest. Okay. Take care now. It’s funny, the connection between people. This could be our last time together. I appreciate you saying that. Huh? At least, it doesn’t seem like a suspect-victim relation. But I don’t think everyone necessarily needs to see each other again. Yeah. Why the long face? Never mind. I really got to go now. Shall we? I should get going now. - No, it’s okay. - No, it’s okay. You need to stop daydreaming so much. What’s been going on? I’ve been trying to contact you for ages. You did that on purpose, didn’t you? Well, I’m just glad to see you again. We haven’t met since that incident with your mom. Yeah, it’s been three months, right? I didn’t even know you moved schools. I just found out today. Yeah. You did go to school this morning, right? Don't tell me you skipped class. I did go. I came straight here from school. How’s school? How are the students? They look like they go to regular schools. I can’t believe we are seniors now. Me neither. What major are you considering? It depends on my grades. You need to start setting goals. The bigger the expectations, the bigger the disappointment. I’m just going to let things play out. You remember Yoo-Na, right? Yeah. And Gi-Beom too? Gi-Beom? Chung Gi-Beom from art class. The one with plain face. Yeah, so? They slept together. How do you know? That’s not what’s important. They’re not even going out. Don’t you think that’s strange? I guess it is strange. They did it at Yoo-Na's place Christmas Eve. Where were her parents? They went on a trip. Wedding anniversary or something? It was perfect. There’s something I don’t like about it though. What is it? I mean, the relationship between men and women naturally deepens, you know. I don’t think it right to do it whenever you’re alone. They have no anticipation. Lucky you have a lot to anticipate? And get this, they did it in her parent’s room. - Why? - Because of the bed. It is big. Wait until SAT ends... I’ll do everything... - Everything? What? - Anything! I’d do anything! Oh stop... I got hungry. Let’s go grab something. Okay. By the way, why’d you come back? Oh, right! Wow, it’s beautiful. It is, isn’t it? I knitted it myself. You could give it to someone special. Yeah, my thoughts exactly. We would go out every now and then and play games together. He would always lose on purpose just to make me feel better. Today however, he insisted on making a bet where the loser would have to fulfill the winner’s wish. He won me stone cold the moment the game started. It was for me to make a wish. I can’t see you anymore. Welcome. That will be 6,800 won. 10,000 won. Please come again. Welcome. I can send parcels here, right? Yeah, just follow the instructions on that machine. You need to put the package on top of the machine first. Then you need to write the recipient’s name, address, and phone number. Here, let me show you. That will be 8,000 won. 10,000 won. That’s it. It should get there by tomorrow. I see. Everything is so "smart" these days. Don’t you feel behind the times? I took the pictures with this. So this lady comes up to me and tells me she wants "panty colored coffee hose". No way! Welcome. That will be 6,300 won. - I’m so sorry. - What the hell. Something came up. I... This isn’t your first time late. Don’t you see I’m in a hurry? I’ll come to work tomorrow thirty minutes early. Forget it. Isn’t it a little late to be going out right now? Let’s have some ramen. No, I don’t want to gain weight. Where are we heading? I’ve been craving for some ramen and thought we’d come here. What?! This is my seat. There’s no your seat or my seat. Move over, will you? I can’t believe you chose a large cup ramen. Just a while ago you were worried about gaining weight. I’m never satisfied with smaller cup ramens. I’m never full eating them. Hello. Oh, hey. I guess you work here part time? It’s been a couple of months since I started working. I was on my way from a friend’s house. Really? It’s good to bump into you again. You seem so. Huh? Hey! What? Snap out of it! So, what happened next? I wasn’t saying anything. I see. - I’d like to charge my phone. - Let me see your battery. What is the last four digits of your phone number? 7362. Everything is all set. That’ll be 1,000 won. 1,000 won. It’ll take thirty minutes to charge. What book are you reading? Huh? Say that again? I’m just wondering what you’re reading. You really seem to be into that book. Oh, it’s just a novel. What’s it called? It’s by an author I personally like. How is it? Here, I’ll read you a passage. We were sitting silently beside each other one afternoon. I thought it was best not to ask why he hadn’t called. Min-Shik hesitated a little and finally said. Let’s keep in touch in college. Across from them was a women leaning against her date laughing hysterically. I didn’t answer back. Min-Shik looked down and said. Though, I think you’re the only thing I have left during the time I was preparing for SAT again. Does Min-shik even know what his saying? I knew we weren’t going to see each other when we were in college. Because everything does past Noryangjin. But I also didn’t want to awkwardize this date I was having in a million years. I gave no response, and Min-shik said something that was so girly that I can laugh at the thought of it. Want me to buy you a doll? Welcome. Do you sell Spris here? Huh? You know the drink that tastes like Chilsung Cider. Oh, you mean Sprite? That’ll be 900 won. 1,000 won. I bought this for you. No, it’s okay. Thank you. You’re not going to eat? Maybe later. It’s more good if you eat with someone. I’ll be your companion. Dig in. Why not? Thanks again. How much do you get paid an hour? 4,500 won. That’s not bad. That’s hardly anything. Other places I know don’t pay as much. Like where? Do they have you work this late? Nope. I work midnight shifts. Most people are asleep then and don’t want to work. Why do you work so late then? Everything is calm and relaxed at this hour. I’m able to concentrate on my books better. What grade are you? 12th grade. Must be tough. Most of my classmates are struggling. Are you? I try not to overdo myself. What major are you taking for college? It depends on my grades. Isn’t there anything you want to do in life? I did have goals, but not anymore. What did you want to do? I wanted to draw. There is actually someone I know who is into drawing. What made you stop? Things don’t always go the way you plan. I better get going. You look thirsty. Have some of mine. Thanks. Do you think I can come again tomorrow? Hello. Hey. I wanted some snacks. - Isn’t it too late for it? - I can’t sleep without eating it. Where do you keep the Corn Chips? It should be right in front of you. What about Potato Stick? It’s right next to the... yeah, that’s it. Any chips you would like to recommend? Huh? What’s popular these days? Popular snack? Didn’t know people were into certain snacks just because they were popular. I still want to know. That’s a tough question. You’ve tried this, right? Nope. It’s really good, but they give you so little. Don’t tell me you haven’t tried this. I haven’t actually. Ambasa goes well with these Onion Ring. Really? How about this? I keep feeling sorry. You don't seem to care about your job. They only sell these here. I don’t really eat chips. I can’t imagine life without them. There are a lot of things better than eating snacks all day. Like what? Like playing the guitar for instance. Are you good at playing the guitar? Not really. I just started this month. They say there is only one reason why men play the guitar. What’s that? Women. - Oh my! - You're here. Did you set all of this? - Yes, I did. - Wow. Let's eat. But, why aren’t there any customers here? I know. The original guest are scarce. Strangely no guests when you visit convenient store. Your boss must really hate me then. Actually, the owner is trying to come up with something for it. It seems like you only have a month left before the close down. What are you going to do in a few months? I can’t say for sure. I might have to apply somewhere else. That’s not what I meant. No? Does it mean we won’t be able to see each other after again? Huh? Never mind. Oh, hold on a sec. What’s this? It’s a present. Why don’t you open it? I’ll open it when I get home. How's your college? My college? Why all of a sudden? How high would my score have to be to get accepted? Thinking about applying? I’m thinking about it. It’s pretty hard to get in. I still have a few months left to prepare. I don’t think three months are enough. If I have a tutor it is. A tutor, huh? Who? Says who? - I didn’t scare you just now? - What? You need to stop daydreaming so much. Here you go. My uncle said he also wrote lines before. Uncle boasted about writing it with three pens at once. Wait, what’s this lovely smile? What... You’ve become a woman since I last saw you. You’ve got something going on, don’t you? Spit it before I need to electrocute you. Alright. Alright. Who is he? You don’t know him. Where did you two meet? At a convenient store. Huh? You’ve seen him once before. When? The part-timer that worked at CVS where we ate ramen. It’s not like we’ve been to one or two CVS together before. Whether it’s CVS or internet cafe, the staff all look the same. Yeah, I know. Who asked out first? Neither of us. What, then it’s nothing. No, it’s not like that. Remember Yoo-Na and Gi-Beom? Yeah. Yoo-Na thought they were going out, but they aren’t. You don’t necessarily have to say it in words. Then? Seeing the person every day and having long conversations with him on the phone is more than enough. Yoo-Na and Gi-Beom were like that too, you know. He gave me a present. What kind of present? Color pencils. Color pencils? Yeah. I’m not sure if that is a good sign. Did you tell him you were preparing for art school? No, I don’t think I have. I just told him I like to draw. I don’t know. But there’s one color pencil missing. Is this second hand? He’s not a person to use them. There’s probably someone around him that does. You know how to knit, right? Yeah. How long would it take to knit a men’s sweater? It would take a while probably. Why all of a sudden? Just wondering. Man, you’re really into him. It’s game over for you. Game over. Hey, where are you going? You lose. Oh! you brought your guitar. Hey, you came. Where are you going? I want to hear you play. I’m still too embarrassed to play in front of people. It’s okay. Well, I’m not. - Just a little, please. - When I get better. Don’t be blush... Take out your book. Did you answer all the questions I assigned? Yes. Which questions did you have trouble the most? This one here. This one, huh? Logarithm. Soo, Bool, Seok, Pen. Huh? You should never let go of your pen when solving math questions. So, if y equals 2x and if this changes to the log of... Hello? Do you deliver? Could I get a gallon of water delivered here? Come on. It’s not like there are a lot of customers there. I'm disappointed. What are you doing up so late? I'm something do. It’s a secret. I’d be spoiling all the fun if I told you. Hey, hey... Never mind. What are you doing this weekend? I’d like to see you during the daytime for a change. Not inside the convenient store, somewhere outside. Why don’t you come down now? I’m in front of your house. What? Why? Come inside. I’m not in the mood to go out. Let’s just stay in. Don’t open the case next to my desk. How come? That’s where I keep my underwear. Peanut butter cream bread. Do you own an orange color sweater? No, I don’t. Why do you ask? Just wondering. So, what happened? What did you tell him? What do you think I told him? I told him to scratch my back. No way! I had no choice. My back was itching. You did that on purpose, didn’t you? Not like that. You need to do it with your hands inside. This is getting really interesting. What happened next? Scratching the back... scratching... and then suddenly the hand came to the front! Seriously? I’m just playing with you. Come on now. He just scratched my back and that was it. Nothing happened? Like what? - He’s not some kind of Buddhist monk, is he? - That’s ridiculous. I get it now. The CVS was in Bongeunsa Temple. So, do you think you can get this sweater done before then? I’m knitting this sweater more than I’m prepping for the SAT, mind you. Hope SAT ends soon. Only one month left. Wait till it’s over. Wait till it’s over. - I’m going to do nothing but sleep all day. - I’m going to do nothing but sleep all day. - I’m going to have my parents raise my allowance. - I’m going to have my parents raise my allowance. - I’ll make a boyfriend. - I’ll make a boyfriend. I’m gonna go on a trip with my boyfriend on Christmas Eve. On Christmas Eve... On Christmas Eve, what? Cute. - You think so? - Yeah. I don’t really like it. No one likes how they look in their ID photo. You should use this photo for your residency card. - Did the SAT Orientations go well? - Yeah. How was it? The school was next to the bus stop. I went inside the classroom and I noticed that my seat was next to the window. I guess I’m lucky. I like window seats. Lucky you. Oh, hold on a second. What’s this? You knew all along? Know what? About this. Hope everything goes sleek like this thread. Thank you. So, what are you going to do Christmas Eve? Why Christmas Eve all of a sudden? Just wondering. I’m not sure. I might be meeting someone then. Who? Someone special. Wouldn’t it be great if that special someone gave you a present. Well, it depends. What would you like to get? Something that’s been given a lot of care and attention. Something that’s been given a lot of care, attention, and keeps you warm at night too, I presume. It’s pretty cold these days, so I wouldn’t mind receiving something that keeps me warm. It’s over. What is? Game over. I don’t know what you’re talking about. You’ll know soon enough. Is there anything you want? Of course there is. What? I want you to sing me a song with your guitar. Come on. Best wishes. I better go. You going? Yeah, I better. Oh, and review the notebook I summarized for you before you go to bed. Can’t you stay? What else is there to do? You can sleep here tonight. What are you talking about? You can sleep on the floor. I’ll bring the blankets. Hey, tomorrows SAT. I know. You know? I don’t want to be late tomorrow. I want you to stay. - Listen, you... - I want you to wake me up and give me breakfast... ...like mother would have done. Are you asleep? Are you asleep? You can sleep here with me if you like. I’ll make a boyfriend. I’m gonna go on a trip with my boyfriend on Christmas Eve. On Christmas Eve...
