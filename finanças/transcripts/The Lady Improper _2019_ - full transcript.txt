Can you quit nagging me? You think I don't have enough troubles already? You think I am making things up? You think you are always right! If you don't stop, I'll leave! Excuse me Here are today's cases, Ms. Yuen And a document for you to review and sign Thanks We're starting. Please relax Once you get the sample, will I be able to... ...have sex tonight? Sure Won't there be problems? What kind of problems? Today's my one-month anniversary with my boyfriend I want to let him do it without a condom Is that possible? I'm not a consultant for your sex life, ma'am If you're so worried, why don't you just lay off it for a day? Come in You got the info wrong on one of yesterday's patients, Ms. Yuen I passed the report to Miss Lee. She might've made the mistake But Miss Lee said... Just talk to Miss Lee. She's responsible for it Parcel for you Thanks Ms. Yuen, the supervisor wants to talk to you Why are there so many errors on these two reports? It's usually you who call people out on their errors How do you explain your own errors? Other people have seen them, too How do you know it's my fault? You signed off on them The responsibility falls on you! Look at this this patient only needs pap smear, not a DNA test This patient needs both, but you only administered the pap smear How do you explain these errors? What's wrong with you? It's been a while since you've taken a holiday Take a few months off! I'll sign off on it "Dad's birthday dinner" Watch out! Siu Man You're right on time, Siu Man Siu Man's here!

Siu Man's making good money now You deserve a break How can I just up and quit? Siu Man's job pays only 20 grand a month How's that enough?

Keep eating Let's eat Have some chicken You guys enjoy I barely said anything and off you ran! Who asked you to wash dishes?! Get back out there! You better tell me the truth What the hell is going on with you and Kuen? We're doing just fine! Just stop asking! "Just fine"? Then why would you need this thing?! This is shameful! That's enough! I got up at 6 this morning for work! I came straight from work for your birthday! Then you start blabbing about my job and my salary! Don't I give you money every month already? I've done as you asked all my life! You wanted me out of the kitchen, so I stayed out You wanted me to go to college, so I went to college You wanted me to get married, so I got married!

We've had it up for 30 years, how can it be dangerous? Wing Kee Restaurant is the most important thing to your dad He refused to take down the sign even after the final notice Then he argued with them He got so worked up that he passed out "Wing Kee Restaurant" Put the boxes over there, be careful with that That's the sign. Take care of it Hey... Sir! Can't you wait until my boss is back from the hospital before you deal with it? What's going on? They want to take down the sign I'm in charge of the restaurant now, but I never received any notice from you You have no right to take down my sign We notified the restaurant about the sign six months ago A sign came down on a pedestrian near here last week We've received a complaint about the danger your sign poses We have to act, ma'am. Please cooperate I don't care I haven't seen a single notification. Please leave if you don't go right now, I'm going to the media! The government is acting unreasonably Taking down my sign means taking down my restaurant! You want a notification? Here you go The sign's been up for decades, sir How can you just take it down like that? I told you the boss is in the hospital Let's go to the pier to watch the sunset Siu Man! Don't run around!

Did you ever see your dad? No I moved to France with my mom after that She died last year... so she never got to eat these two dishes again No wonder a chef from France would work in a place like this I hear that Ping used to be a chef at a 5-star hotel before starting this restaurant Try this You know, I think your dad's a great chef These two dishes are really hard to make You must know the taste really well Do you remember what they're supposed to taste like? Should they taste saltier or sweeter? Where did I go wrong? I hate these dishes, actually All my life, I've never appreciated my dad's craft Yet you obsess over it After my mom died, my dad and I hardly talked He was always working in the kitchen Whenever I came in here, he kicked me out We're actually quite alike Close your eyes Why?

Yeah This way, there's a seat over here - Have a seat - Thanks This is the their first performance, so please encourage them with your applause Thanks for coming This is good! This is really good! This is the old Wing Kee taste! - It was way too salty last time - Inedible, man! Do you know how much effort it takes to make these? The bones of the mud carp have to be picked one at a time The Pork Belly takes at least two, three hours to make, too Jiahao's really done it He accomplished his mission before he left By the way, Siu Man... Jiahao left a letter for you Do you know why your father stopped making these dishes? He talks tough but he's a softie inside These two dishes remind him of your mom With his wife gone and you moving out, he didn't see the reason to make them anymore Ciao bella! I'm hereby returning Wing Kee's kitchen to you I know you won't resent me for leaving like this Consider the two dishes as my parting gift to you I want you to know something You're the one who helped me fulfill my dream I thought that I was making these two dishes for my mom But later I realized that it was to search for my dad I hated him all these years for leaving my mom and I I left Europe and came to Hong Kong because I wanted to rediscover my passion for cooking Little did I know... that Ping had already understood this decades ago His reason for opening the restaurant was actually in line with what I believe We both just want people to enjoy simple, delicious food Meeting you was something special Remember when I said that we're alike? Perhaps we're both searching for the right direction in life I've found mine I'm going to my mom's hometown and open a restaurant there Come by when you have time Is it too salty? It's good Dad, about the lease... Let's give that a rest I've always been too strict with you But I'll let you call the shots now Siu Man I've been looking for you I've been texting you Why won't you return my messages? Ah Him - Why don't we - Let's get married I can take care of you Don't do this... I'm not acting out of impulse I've been thinking a lot I want to sleep next to you every night... and wake up with you every morning Don't work at the restaurant anymore I'll take care of you I don't see what's wrong with working at a restaurant I'm sorry Siu Man!
