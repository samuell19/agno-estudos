I repeat, we do not see the ship. I do. It's right outside the window. Cortez is dead. Send the coordinates to Dr. Fielding at JPL. Ken! I don't read the coordinates. I need them here at JPL. Major Collins, go to manual. Put the coordinates on the crypto-key and get it down to Dr. Fielding at JPL yourself. Come on! Come on! Major Collins, get out of there. Where's your retainer? Mom, NASA's testing new boosters using solid rocket fuel. Those things can incinerate anything. Anything else we're forgetting? Sunscreen, good. You ready, bud? Just a few more minutes. Sweetie, you don't need any more time in that chair. If you're worried about my posture, this chair is ergonomic. Look, my spine just perfectly aligns. Alex, honey, there is a whole world out there beyond these screens. There's nothing to worry about. You're gonna make friends. I have friends. Come on. Let's go. - Bye, Mom. - Bye, baby. Gonna be a lot of cute girls up there, Dariush, knock 'em dead. Don't be a creep, Dad. Dariush... I love you, son. No matter what. All right, Jacobi, let's bounce. What did you say your relationship was again? She's my niece. It's my sister-in-law's. You can kinda see it in the eyes. What's your business here? She's got a spelling bee out in Camarillo. How many L's in Camarillo? You're gonna do good in America. Okay. Let's go. Come on. You're light. Nope. More. There you go. Pleasure doing business with you, kid. Where to? Rim of the World. Okay. You know, I went to camp when I was a little girl. You've said. That's where I met Flora Beetworth. I mean, I met a lot of cool people, but she was the coolest. It's okay, Alex. Are sure you wanna take your dad's watch? Mom, I'll take care of the watch. Come on, honey. Come on, you can do this. It's going to be great. Look how beautiful it is. Rim of the World. This is gonna be so awesome. Look at all the other kids your age. Alex! I am your leader, Logan. Now, if you look around, you'll see a lot of interesting things. First interesting thing we have is Carl right here. He is the black man on the campus. We gonna teach you about black culture, pay attention, gonna only do this once. Ready? Snap! That's called the black man handshake. Okay, don't wanna see you doing that. Only for black people. Oh, hey, use retail method when folding my clothes, Jacobi. Okay? I don't wanna see any creases. - Retail what? - Retail method. - What's that? - What rich people do. You wouldn't know. Don't turn your back, I'll slap you. - They're just kidding. - Alex, look, see we got music over here. Music! Come on, Alex, dance a little bit. You know how to dance? You always wanted to learn how to play guitar... and dancing. Keep playing, I'm dancing. Keep playing, I'm dancing. Oh, I'm sorry, ladies. Cool. Maybe next time, no originals, play the people what they want. Let's go. It's gonna be great. It's gonna be great. Uh, this, this is Conrad right here, okay. Conrad, he's a little... Look at these people you're meeting. Sheesh, Conrad. - Hey. - What are you doing? Welcome to the jungle, ginger nugget. Nope, can't call him that. Second of all, put your titties away. What? These titties? Don't bounce the titties, I told you to put them away. Why's your shirt so small? It can't even connect. You must be Alex! Welcome to the Rim of the World Adventure Camp. Thanks. Back there is registration, get checked in, get your cabin number. And we'll sign you up for some afternoon activities. Hey, how are your pipes? - What? - Our musical this year is Fiddler on the Roof! Wait a second. I think I just found my Tevye. You're going to have a heck of a time. Very exciting! I offer greetings, my fair princess. I humbly submit my name, Alex. She seemed nice. All right, who's next? China? Okay, um... No, no, no. Ni hao! Um... Welcome... to... camp! I love... Jackie Chan. Do you understand the words comin' out of my mouth? Okay? Move along. Wow. China. My man, where you been, baby? You remember the black man hand... - Nope. - You said I can't do it. I was testing you. Good shit, baby. Good shit. Move along. You gotta start wearing the silk. That's what gets the girls. You can't wear... Never mind. Ooh! Mmm-mm-mm. Put it in my box. I'm sorry. What? Put it in my box. - Uh... - Just take it out and put it in my box. Oh... You saying in front of a lot of people right now. You sure about that? Can you put your cell phone in the box, please? Whoo! Phone! Yes. Yeah, I thought you meant something else. - I was... - What'd you think I meant? You don't wanna know what I thought you were... - Dariush. Did you...? - No, no, no, no. - Dariush. - I didn't think that, no. I didn't... - Oh... - I didn't... You know what, to be honest with you, I left my phone at home. - I don't have my cell phone with me. - Ah. Okay. Okay, I better say goodbye to you now before I embarrass you in public. You know what that means? No, Mom! Mom, you said you wouldn't. Okay. I love you. Have fun. Hold this. What's up, tool? You ready? This is gonna be fun. Cool helmet. Don't look down. Don't look down. All right, Zhenzhen, you are good to go. Safety first. Mm-hmm. 'Sup, girl? I'm Dariush. Is this a layover because we're making that connection, you feel me? Oh, all right. That pickup line was the worst I've ever heard, man. I got game. Girls fall when they see me. Yeah, they fall off the zip line and almost commit suicide. No, they fall in love. - Is that right? - That's right. Like that one? It was cool... But you should've said it to her, not me. - Next time. - Don't use it on me. Carrot Top's up next, you ready, Alex? Let's do this, baby. Come on. Come to the edge. Look, right over to the edge. There we go. Come on, come to the edge. - All you gotta do is breathe. - I can't. I can't. Breathe. Look at me. Look at me, all you gotta do is breathe. Okay? Close your eyes and when you open them you'll be on the other side. - I can't, I can't, I can't! - The other side of the zip line... You won't die, you won't die! Okay. Maybe camp's just not for you. Okay? Hey, hey, stop. So, you're this summer's chickenshit, huh? A NASA spokeswoman has said "The agency's repeated attempts to contact the International Space Station are failing." But stopped short of revealing possible causes. When asked if the ISS and it's three scientists onboard could be in danger, the agency held firm that it is doing everything it can to restore communication. Meanwhile, reports of observed troop movements... - Toy Story was messed up. - How? Take the third one, for example, that teenager, he represents the white folks. Huh? And Cowboy, Spaceman and Mr. and Mrs. Potato-people, they represent the brothers. - Okay, so let me get this straight. - Uh-huh. - We're the toys. - Preach. And when the white man leaves the room, we get to have fun. We get to shake it up. But when the white man comes back in, we gotta get stiff and do what they tell us to do. Now you're on my level. So it's obviously the ruling class justification for the inferior conditions of the working class. - My brother! - What about Finding Nemo? Don't say nothing bad about Finding Nemo. Okay, Alex! One more question. Why are we talking like black men from the '80s? - That's what they want us to do. - Preach, brother. Got us with all these white kids, - you see any black kids? - I see one. Dariush? He got enough money, he damn near white. Alex. Alex. Alex! Alex, come on! All right, keep up. I can't feel my legs. I'm falling behind. I'm so tired! Move! Shotgun! Yep, yep, yep! Campers in the back. - What? - Campers in the back. Rosa Parks fought for my right to sit up here, so... - Really, dude? - Keep driving. Rosa ain't fight for shit for your lil' chunky ass, get in the back. And don't slam my door, you little thick ass... Don't slam my door! - All right. y'all the king is back. - Come on, Dariush. All right, scoot over, man. - Move, man. My nuts is hot. - Sorry. You're making me chafe, scoot over. Hope y'all not afraid of sharks. Put y'all seat belt on. 'Cause my license is suspended. Wait, your license is suspended? - Just a little bit. - What does that mean? It means let's not get pulled over. Ah, sorry guys, some kid shit the canoe while shooting the rapids. Aw! Hey, Cosmo, we're gonna need the second hose down here. It'll just be a few more minutes. What? Ain't nobody scared of a little poo. Okay, I am deathly afraid of a lot of poo. It's more poo than canoe in there. Two kids shit the van on the way here and we still made it. And I don't want to be Patient Zero for a pink eye epidemic. So just calm down. Wait a minute, we here for canoeing? I thought we was motorboating. You like that? Gimme some. Okay, you know what? That's inappropriate, Dariush. Although I am flattered. - Is that a new necklace? - Is that a new hat? It is. I got it at Paradise Island. Where are you going? It makes your eyes pop. Zhenzhen! Zhenzhen, do you know where you're going? I don't think we should wander this far. Maybe we should head back? Zhenzhen, do you know how to get back? Hello? Ooh! What are you doing here? Just dropped a deuce. Shit I just took back there, been touching cloth since last night. - What? - Yeah. Between me and you, I just turned the evergreens brown up in this joint. Let me talk to you for a minute. - No, don't touch me. - Come on. - It's exposure therapy. - That's unsanitary. I'm gonna help you conquer your fear. No! What? Wait, no. No! - Please, no. - I'm helping you, calm down. - It's okay, I got you. - Please, no, no, no, no. - Look down. - No, please. - I'm trying to help you. - Please, no. - Yeah, you can. - No, please! - Stop. I can't. Let go. - I'm trying to help. - Calm down, man. - No, please! Let him go! I'm trying to... Let him go. Move along, mountain hobo. - We've got no qualms with you. - No. - Help me. Help me! - I'm not gonna ask you again. Huh? Uh-huh. Come over here. - Oh, ow. - Big mistake, bro. Ow! Ooh. Five years of Krav Maga, bitch. I'll Gal Gadot you so hard right now. What's your ground game? What? What? Unh! You okay? Thanks. Yeah. - Who are you? - My name is Gabriel. You live around here? Yeah. Yeah. You guys are from the, um, the camp, right? - She's not much of a talker. - You know what? You know... You know what? That was a lucky punch. Lucky punch. Yeah, you know, I haven't acclimated to the altitudes yet. - So my reflexes are kinda... - sub-par. What the hell was that? What does it say? It's the emergency broadcast system. "All civilians are to evacuate metropolitan areas immediately. Under no circumstances approach any unknown aircraft." It's the next 7-Eleven. We gotta get back to the van. Anyone know the way? - Uh... - I do. Follow me. Okay. Whoa! Whoa. Slow your roll, Dora the Explorer, all right, this is my clique. Soldiers, out! Let's go. You guys know if... You... Everyone's gone! Assholes! Probably got the emergency signal and went back to camp. Oh! What the fu...? Looks like explosions, in the upper atmosphere. Call and have them send the van to pick you up. It's dead! I had 90% two seconds ago. Piece of shit Boost Mobile. Mine's dead, too. - Whoa! Ah! - Ah! Oh my God, it's Independence Day. It's June, Gabriel! Oh, wait, maybe North Korea's invaded! Zhenzhen, call it off! We just need to wait here until the adults realize they left us and come back. Oh, man! What if they never come back? I'm gonna die here with you losers? I never even had sex before! I'ma clear that up. I had sex... I had sex before, I mean... I haven't had sex with two girls at once. That's what I mean. - I told you I had sex 'cause... - No. All right, hey, look. We're not gonna die! It's probably just a forest fire. We gotta get going, bears out here can be crazy. Whoa! Whoa! Okay, slow your roll. Did you just say bears? I don't do so well with bears, man. I'm not trying to get DiCaprio'd up in here! - Look, no one does well with bears. - Oh, whoa. Uh... ask Werner Herzog. Grizzly Man lived with those things for years, so check that out. - Did you watch the end of that movie? - "Did I watch..." - Yeah, I watched... No, I didn't. - No, dude. Okay, stop. Gabriel's right. Black bears are opportunistic carnivores. We're not gonna survive the wilderness - through the night. - Then let's go! Come on! Hello! Hello! Where is everybody? Is anyone here? Yo, do you see anybody? What's that? "Gone down mountain..." Oh, they left us! Oh, sh... - Not all of them! - Huh? It's Heavy Metal Conrad. - Conrad! - Conrad! Is he dead? He's breathing. He must have slept through the evacuation. Okay, what kind of asshole sleeps through an evacuation? Wake him up. Uh... I don't think that... that was milk. Line's dead. It's 'cause the power's out. You know what an EMP is? Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's that music white people dance to. No, that's EDM! EPM stands for electromagnetic pulse. A nuclear explosion in the upper atmosphere can cause one. And it knocks out most electronics, over a really big area. But what does that mean? It means nothing works. Not even cars? Well, you guys have food and a roof over your head. You could do a lot worse than staying - and waiting this out. - Wait, waiting what out? Shit! Come on, come on, come on! Those are F-22 Raptor air superiority fighters. What are those ships they're fighting? I've never seen anything like them. Run! Go, get the hell out here. Go! Hurry up! Go, go, go! Move out of the way! Come on, come on! Go! Oh! Look out! - Look out, look out! - Whoa! What's going on? What? What is that? - It's a Dragon capsule. - How do you know all this stuff? There's a reason my mom sent me to outdoor camp. Oh, God, that thing's huge. What the hell? - No, don't touch it! Dude! - Oh! Ah! It's still hot from re-entry. - Oh, does anyone have any water? - Good idea. Thanks. thanks. Mmm... You serious? - What? - Gimme it. What? You're not gonna open that thing, are you? There could be someone inside. No, leave it be. All right? - What? - We don't know what this shit is. - Don't touch it. - Ew. This is animal kingdom out here, bitches. All right, survival of the fit... Hello. Is... is anybody in here? Ah! Guys! Come on, come on, come on! I thought space was supposed to make you weightless? We're not in space, dude. - Where am I? - At Rim of the World Adventure Camp. - Near Big Bear. - This is a camp? Yeah, I was disappointed too, but... Coordinates all wrong. Pasadena... Dr. Fielding. I'm sorry, but we're not near Pasadena right now. - JPL! - JPL? The Jet Propulsion Laboratory. It's part of NASA. Try not to move as much, okay? - Try not to move as much. - The key! The key. Take it to JPL, Dr. Fielding. It has everything on it. Excalibur, everything. Go! What the actual shit? - You're gonna die if we leave you. - We'll all die if you don't! Run! Was that an alien? Run! Keep going, come on! Let's go! It has a dog! Alex! Come on! Hey, wait! Wait, wait! How big was it? Was it, like, puppy-size? 'Cause maybe it just wants to cuddle. Hell, no! We have to go! Alex, come here. Dariush. Come here. Dariush. Come here. Oh! Thank you, Baby Jesus! No! Help me, help me! I'm coming! Go, go. Go, go. Go, go. Run! Run! Shit! Let's go! Come on! Let's go! - What are you doing? - Come on. Where is it? Oh, shit! Shh. Stop talking. Shh. Stop... - He's coming, we have to hide. Please. - Shh! Shh! He's coming, he's coming. That's fecal suicide! No! Crap! Ugh! Not sanitary. We gotta go. Come on. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Why are we leaving? This an alien-proof hiding spot. - We have to help them. - And die too? - No, thanks! - Just go! Go! No, come on. No, wait, look... Gabriel! Wait! Wait, wait, wait. Now what? Aw, hell, naw, man! Oh, shit! Come on! Go, go, go. Go! Shh. What the hell? It's Conrad. Conrad. Conrad. Conrad! Hey. Hey, Conrad. Dariush. Go, go! Speed your ass up, Gabriel! It's Cujo. Go! Oh, shit, get the door! - What? - Get the door! Get the door! It's coming. - Come on, get in here! - I forgot the door! Where is it? You see it? - No. - I don't see it! - Oh! - No! Guys, come on. Let's go! - Leave! The dog is out there! - Leave! We can't hear you! - Go away! The dog's out there. - Go! We gotta let 'em in, we gotta let 'em in! No. What are you doing? "Let them in." No! Zhenzhen? Zhenzhen. Leave it alone! - Come on! - Leave the buttons alone. Stop it! You wanna die? Oh, shoot! Alex, you're welcome. I put the dog on fire for you guys! And Gabriel was selfish and he didn't help at all. What button do I press to open this window? Help me! Go. I think we got it. At what point do we trip Zhenzhen and keep running? I didn't sign up for this shit, man. This can't be real. What about this isn't real? He just sneeze-jizzed all over us! Just shut up, I can't think with your constant bitching. Hey, I'm allowed to bitch, all right? That thing had its tongue in my mouth. How do you know it was its tongue? We don't know their anatomy. What are you saying? Honestly, it's plausible that sophisticated creatures, like alien males, have cranial genitalia. It had its dick in my mouth? Yeah. Uh-uh. Guys, we need to stay calm, okay? We need to stay calm. Calm? I just probably swallowed a load of alien babies that are gonna turn into puppies and leap out of my chest. I need to find my mom, she's gonna know what to do. If she's alive. Hey, don't say that. Chances are our parents are gone, all right! Hey, what did I say about touching that kid? What are you gonna do? Gonna sucker punch me again? Go for it, 'cause I chop your ass in the neck, and then I'll chop you in the head - and finish you with a rear-naked choke. - Do you ever shut up? I mean, between my fist and that alien's dick, your mouth should be worn out by now. Why are you hitting me? What we do in life... echoes in eternity. What the fuck? Hold the line! Stay with me. If you find yourself alone, riding in green fields with the sun on your face, do not be troubled. For you are in Elysium, and you're already dead. Did she just quote Gladiator? Since when did she speak English? Since when does she speak? - May I ask where we're going? - My jaw hurts... The astronaut said that this key can stop the aliens and we need to take it to TRL. JPL. - A NASA facility. - Tastes like truffle butter. In the foothills of Pasadena. I went there once for a robotics contest with my dad. - Do you know how to get there? - Without GPS? No, probably not. It's over 70 miles away from here. Whoa, whoa, whoa, what? Wait, you wanna head 70 miles into the city? The alert said stay out of metropolitan areas, not head straight into them. We don't have to take it all the way to Pasadena. Let's just get this key down the mountain and take it to adults. Tell them to take it to JPL. Oh, my gosh. Guys. There's a sheriff's station down a bit, we could get it to a cop. That's a great idea, Gabriel. Now, let's get some bikes and kick some ass. Damn, girl, your English is good. They gave us the code at registration, it's, um... six-six-nine. Come on, man. Hurry up, dude. Come on. It's six-six-nine. Six... nine... Dude, what are you talking about? I said six-six-nine. Come on, man. Dude, hurry up! Just put it in there. What are you, dumb? I'm not dumb. Here, Gabriel. Let me help you. I want this one, it's got a 'Wakanda Forever' sticker. Hey... what's wrong? I can't go with you. Why not? I can't ride a bike. I never learned. It's okay. You guys can go without me. - Cool, we out! - No. We got back down to your camp and everyone left you, how did that make you feel? All right, you get on one side of Alex and you get on the other, and we'll get him up to speed. - Gotcha. - All right? I won't let you fall. You guys are... I... You got this. Put your feet back on the pedal. The key is to get moving. The faster you go, the easier it is to stay balanced. Are you sure about this? No. Good, you're good. Now, just keep doing that. I don't... I don't know if I can do this. Alex. You're already doing it. You're doing it! Yeah! You're doing it. Yeah, boy! - Whoo! - Look at him. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, you guys. I'm doing it! Whoo-hoo! Whoo! Yeah! This is so much fun, you... - Oh! - Alex? - Are you okay? - Yo, is he dead? Alex? - You okay? - Yo, you good? You okay? You okay? Holy sh... Yeah, like holy... shit! You all right? Is that where we're going? There! Man, this place is trashed. Looks empty. Guys, I don't... Nobody's, uh... What? You guys go ahead. I'll just stay back and watch our bikes. What? Oh, yeah, because the aliens wanna jack our mountain bikes. Yeah, looters could take them. Yeah, someone should stay and watch. Whatever, man. Hello? Officers? Shh! What if people are in here? What do you mean, "shh"? If I see a clown on a tricycle, I'm out. - Yes, we should go back. - No! We always move forward. Come on. Okay, offices. What? It's a warning. "Nuclear weapons authorized for Los Angeles Basin. Europe destroyed. Asia... decimated." Hello? Hello? "Primary directive: locate alien power source." What? Anybody? Hey. Oh, hey. Don't be scared. Come on. Come on. Hey. What's your name? Alex. My name's Lou. See those keys right there? Can you get 'em for me? Alex, you're not gonna believe what I just saw, man. It can't get any worse. Oh, shit! What... - He wants me to let him go. - What, you... Oh, no. No, that's not going to happen. Not today. Not at all. What's going on? Oh, what? They just evacuate and leave me in here? - So whatever it is up there can kill me? - They're aliens. And I suggest you keep your mouth closed when they get up in here, 'cause... When it... What'd you do? I was trying to help. Yeah, it got a little crazy out there. Look, Alex, you can stay here and flirt with Buffalo Bill all day long. All right? But let's get rid of that astro-key so someone can stop this thing. So that key's gonna stop this thing? Come on, man. Dariush, it shouldn't be our job to decide who lives and who dies. Yeah. But right now it is, Alex. The police obviously put him in here for a reason. All right, and I say... we respect their decision, and I'm black! And he's probably a diddler. No one deserves to be left in a cage. Yeah, unless you're a murderer! I say we let him go. What do you say, Alex? You're the final vote. Okay. Look, I got a boy at home. And if you leave me in here... I'm gonna die. No boy deserves to lose his dad like that, right? I mean... you ready to live with that? Do you promise not to hurt us? Yeah, I promise not to hurt you, man. Wait until we leave. Then you can go. How is your watch still working after the pulse? It's not electronic, it's mechanical. - Yo, he's doing good, right? - Oh. Yo. Watch out! It was my dad's. - He, uh... - Gave it to you? - Yeah, he gave it to me. - Yo! You got this, Alex. You doing good, man! Whoa! Hey! Hey! - Help! - Stop! - Hey! - Stop! Hey! Stay where you are. Do not move! Same side. Same side. Same side! Kids! Kids! You should've evacuated hours ago. We're at war. Sir, we were in the mountains when the attacks started. Can you tell us what's going on? How big is the attack? Did it reach the nation's finest Mercedes dealership? - Dude, how can you... - My dad owns it. - I'm the future heir. - Shut up! All I can tell you is you are not safe here. Everyone on the bus right now. It'll take you to the evacuation center. - Let's go! - Whoa. - Hey, wait! - Let's go! - Knock it off! - Wait! Hey! Stop! What? You need to take this key to Pasadena. Where'd you get this? An astronaut from the space station gave it to us. - She said we need to take it to JPL. - What's on that key can stop the aliens. You need to get that to JPL in Pasadena to a Dr. Fielding. We've been receiving Morse code from a Dr. Fielding at JPL all day. Finding this key has been the primary objective. Thanks, kid. You may have just saved the world. We'll take it from here. Okay, we need to go. Move out. Now! - Yeah. - Yeah! We did it! Yo, we did... Yo, I am so happy I told y'all to go down the hill. Great job, guys, you did it. Yeah, we did it. Now move your ass. Let's go! - Yo. - We did it. Zhenzhen, we did it. - Yeah. - Let's go. Look! There they go. Oh, my... Shit! Alex, are you okay? Alex! Get out of here. - Go! - Which door is blocked? Take cover! Go. Come on! - Let's go! - Move! Let's go. We gotta get out of here, man! Get out of here. Kick it! Go! Go, go, go! Let's go, out! Go! Oh, shit! Go the other way. Watch out for the dogs! Come on! Go! Go! Go! Keep your head down, man! Holy shit! Oh, no! - Pick this up with me. - What are you doing? - Pick it up with me. - You gotta get out of here. - We're gonna get you out! - Stop, you gotta go. I can't move it by myself! You have to go. Yo, Zhenzhen, get the radio. Come on, we can't leave you. Stop. Stop. It's okay. It's on you now. Okay? You have to let me go. - No, no, I... I can't! - Shh. - No! - Stop! Take this key. Here, take it. Promise me. Promise me... you will not let anything stop you. Okay? Okay, now go. Go! Now! Move! Come on! Oh, shit! I told you that was a stupid idea. You idiots almost got me killed. I don't even wanna be at summer camp. I should be in Cabo taking jelly shots off someone's ass cheeks. Slow down. Slow down. What do you think these things are after? Food maybe? Resources? It's possible their planet went dry and the came to raid ours. What gives you that idea? Nothing! It's the most common invasion movie plot. Maybe they're here to find mates. That would explain the erotic rendezvous with Dariush earlier. Hey, whoa. No. We're not gonna do all that, okay? That was strictly platonic. Let's just head north, okay? To the desert. Get as far away from that thing as we can get, all right? - As far away... - There is no away from those things. Zhenzhen's right. The only way we're going to survive is if we get this key to Dr. Fielding. - It's what that soldier was gonna do. - He died. Okay, look, if a bunch of bad-ass marines can't get that key 40 feet away without getting deep fried, what makes you think that we can get it 40 miles? We have to. What? It's on us. Okay. We're not going anywhere until we get some food. Maybe even some sleep if we can. All right, fine. What's up with Chico? - It's my street. - Great! Can we go in your house? That's my house, but... It's not my home. I haven't been totally honest with you guys. I was in the mountains because... I was in juvie. And I escaped. So even if my mom is here... she's not gonna wanna see me. Come on, man. Go, go, jump left! - No! - What the hell was that? - Run! - Where do we go? Follow me. Oh, damn! Man, we need to get my man Jacobi up in here. It's looters. All right, let's find something to eat. Man, I need a T-bone steak, some cheese eggs and Welch's grape. I shouldn't have hit you. It was my fault. I don't know. I'm good, bro. I mean... it doesn't hurt as much as seeing all this gunk on my new J's. How do you care about sneakers in a time like this? You know what? You guys are lucky. You don't have friends. It's hard out here for a pimp, you know? Gotta keep up with the flyest shit, you know, the dopest kicks. Tightest whip. Baddest chick. And my friends, they're like bears. Soon as they smell weakness, they're just coming straight at your neck. That's why I keep this on my neck. Diamonds. Does Dariush mean "douchebag" in Farsi? What's Farsi? It's the language your mom was screaming when you were coming out of her ass. Hey, don't talk about my mom's ass. All right. You wish you were there. No offense, dude, those don't sound like friends. Yeah... Hey, how did you even end up in jail? My dad left when... when I was about ten. You know, I got a job as a bag boy, at a grocery store my mom worked at. To, you know... help her with money. One time she steps away, I took over the cash register. I was helping a customer, and, uh, he started to accuse me of stealing from him. I guess I gave him the wrong change. I get numbers... like, muddled in my head sometimes, unless I see them written down. But he didn't believe me. And, um... I just... I lost it. So I decked him. Broke his nose. Mom got fired and... they sent me away. She never came around to visit me once. You can't choose your family. But you can always make a new one. Come on. A young Yoda up in here? - Come on, guys. - Oh, we're taking an old school selfie? One, two, three. - Dude, stop playing with the Rubik's cube. - I can't, okay! I can't! We can all agree that she gets her own bed, right? Well, yeah, obviously. It's the only gentlemanly thing to do. It's only right. It sounds like a plan. One of you can sleep with me. Hold it. Hold it. Wait, wait! Did she just say one of us could sleep with her? - Maybe we misheard her. - Okay, look. I will volunteer my services for the good of the group, and because I've had the most experience. With what? Not getting any? Hey, it's better than eating Lithuanian smoothies from your bunk mate in juvie. - Lithuanian smoothies? - You don't need to know. How about we get Alex and Zhenzhen to sleep together? - Because he doesn't want to. - I wouldn't say I don't want to. - They have a connection! - We do? So don't be a cock-block. Fine, fine. All right. Okay, cool. I won't block your cock. Be free. Thanks. It's no problem. Ah, crap! I forgot my sleep apnea mask. If I snore, I'm sorry. You have sleep apnea? How old are you? It's non-age-discriminate, Gabriel! Just move over. I'm glad it was you. Shh! Shh! Shh! Aliens... Yeah. We gotta go. You see anything? No, come on. Guys, we should turn back. We can't now, man. We're already here. Dude, I'm telling you, this is how people die in movies. Guys. You see anything? You need some Frebreze on these sheets. Ah! Oh! Oh! Oh, shit! Not another step. - Move! - I'm backing up. The hell you doing out here? We're in the middle of an alien invasion. Oh, yeah, I mean, and you're the ones with the Purge masks. - Wrong genre, bro. - We got a comedian here. No! There are aliens out here, okay? We're not the enemy. You guys have something we're looking for. Dignity? What'd you say? Everybody calm down. Look what we found. Lou! - Oh my God, Lou! - Thank you, Baby Jesus. - Thank you, God! - Lou. - Thank God! - Hold on, you know this guy? No. No, no, no, no. Do we know him? Hell, yeah we know him! - Yes! Yes! - We go way back. Lou, my negro! Lou, you know me. We're like this. I wanted to free... Alex was the one who was like, "Leave him in there," and I was like, "Dude, let's free him. He's a human." Do you mind, if you could just tell these handsome men, the ones... pointing the shotguns at our face, to, you know... not... not do that? - Please? - Please. Please. I don't think anyone needs to get hurt tonight. But Alex... if you'd be so kind as to give me that? This? Yeah. This is our only shot at defeating the aliens. Yeah. That means someone will pay a lot of money for it. Give me... the key. I can't. I made a promise. Alex, give him the key. Enough. Okay? You can give me the key and just walk away. Or I can cut your head off and take the key from the stump. I trusted you. The cemeteries are full of people who trusted me. Oh, shit! Oh, sh... - Hurry! - Run! Come on! - Gabriel! - Gabriel! Gabriel, what are you doing? Zhenzhen, throw me the glow sticks. - What are you doing? - What are you doing? - Gabriel, hurry up! - Over here. - Throw 'em! Come on! - Come here. What are you doing? Hey! Come here! - Gabriel, hurry up! - Come here, you're gonna die! - Get over here! - Hurry! Hurry up, Gabriel! Come on! Get him, get him, get him! - Come on! Come get me! - Gabriel! Gabriel! - Hurry up! - Gabriel, come on! Go! Hurry! Gabriel, come on! Get out, Gabriel! Oh, shit, it worked, Gabriel! - Oh, my God. - It worked. Go! Go! That was the same alien from camp. I thought we killed that thing. If it came down with the capsule, that means it survived the heat of atmospheric re-entry Which means it must have tremendous cellular regeneration abilities. English, Alex, please. It's like Wolverine. Oh. Why the hell is the following us? It's pissed about its dog. You ever watch Marley and Me or Beethoven? It's a primal bond. It's out for revenge. Ask John Wick. You're putting human motives on an alien lifeform. No, it probably just had orders to kill Collins and anyone she came in contact with. We're just loose ends to this thing. - No, you know what, dog theory was better. - Who gives a frog's fat ass why? This ain't Comic-Con, bitches. All that matters is that it wants us dead. And we can't kill it. She's right. We should just keep moving. I'm done with your ideas. You were the one who thought to let Hannibal Lecter out of his cell. Consider your leadership privileges... revoked! Sometimes you do the right thing and it doesn't work out. That doesn't mean it wasn't worth doing. Who the hell told you that? My dad. Never knew what it meant until right now. Look, why is it up to us to save humanity? What, do you think someone else should do it? Of course you do. The kid who's always had everything done for him. Maybe Mommy and Daddy can pay the alien to go away, buy him a new Mercedes... Hey! You don't know my family, dude. That's enough! That's enough! You don't know me. My family has nothing! Oh, yeah? Except for a car dealership and a mansion and a yacht! No, the dealership is gone. It's all gone. That's why they sent me to camp, man. It's... It's just stuff. I don't know who I am without all that stuff. And... they're taking my dad. He's going to jail. I'm... I'm sorry. Ah, here we go. I'm sorry I head-butted you. You should clean that up. Yeah, that's fine. Sorry for... punching you. It's Dr. Fielding. He's trying to contact us. We gotta go. Maybe we should try to find some clothes? No clue what that thing can track, it might be our scent. Then let's go. I hope they got a McDonald's in here, I need me, like, two McDoubles and an ice cream. Hurry, come on. Gotta get inside. Come on. I know Gucci's downstairs, let's go. Yo. You guys... How do you think an alien would do against this? The circle is complete! I am your master now. No, the line is, "The circle is now complete. Now I am the master." Okay, we really need to get you a girl. Gotta cut this shit out. You know too much about this Star Trek shit. - Guys! - It's Star Wars. It's time for a change. Sorry. It's okay. That pamphlet must mean a lot to you. For you to bring it all the way here. I didn't bring it here. It brought me. Well then, why did you leave home? Let's just say dad wanted a boy. Zhenzhen, what are you doing? That's what brought you here. Yeah, but... this is why I'm staying. Let it go, man. Come on. - Guys! Guys! - What? - Look. - What's up? Yeah, Mannequin Skywalker. - Alex... - Man, if you don't... No, you know what? That was... That shit was funny. That was pretty good. Give me some. Aw, come on, man. Don't tell me we gotta teach you again? 1973 Ford Mustang Mach One. My dad had one just like it. That Mustang doesn't have any computers or anything that can be fried by the pulse, right? Right. - Come on! - I'm driving! - Let's go! - Shotgun. Finally got some real wheels up in here, let's go! - Yes! - Let's ride. Oh, my God. - Whoo! - I'm getting in the back. - Let's roll! - Yeah! - Let's go. - Hit it. Start this shit up! Oh. - I can't drive a stick. - What? Oh. Hold on tight. Ah! Oh, shit! It's on top of the roof! Hang on! Oh, shit, where's it at? - It's gone. Gimme some. - Whoo! - Oh, it's gone! - Yes! Oh! Oh! - Jump! - What? Are you crazy? Jump! Jump! Jump! Way to go, Zhenzhen! Is everyone okay? Yeah, I think so. Guys. Guys! I don't have the key. - What? - It's probably in the car. - We need that key. - Ah! Damn it. - Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. - Where you going? To get the key. No way we can kill that thing, it's just gonna reanimate. Yeah, but... but we need that key to finish this off. - You're gonna die if you go down there. - She's right, we'll go together. So all four of us can die? I thought you were supposed to be the smart one. It's my turn. Look, man... Did you know I was named after the ancient King of Persia, Darius? Well, do you know who Darius's greatest rival ever was, the only one to ever defeat him? - Alexander the Great. - Yeah. Yeah, I knew you'd know that. Well, look... this time... Darius gets to be the hero. Good luck. Come on! Oh, shit. Oh, I got it. I got it! I got it. - Yeah! Yes! - Yes. I got the key. Hey, behind you! What? I got it. - No! - Dariush, behind you! - Turn around! - No! We gotta go. Come on, Dariush! Go, run! - Look out! - We gotta go! Come on. You okay? - That cut looks terrible. - I'm okay, I'm all right. Let's just get this key to JPL. That was really cool driving back there. I couldn't have done that. You don't give yourself enough credit. I'm told girls find bravery attractive. I've never really had much of that. My whole life I have been searching for love. When I saw you on the bridge... I knew you were the one. If you feel the same way... kiss me now and we will be together forever. I'm sorry, my Mandarin is rudimentary. Hmm? What did you say? What did you say? Zhenzhen, I don't actually speak Mandarin. - What did you say? - Yo, look! Look, JPL. - What? - Whoa! - Let's go. - Come on! - Man, this place got hit hard. - The building is destroyed. Nobody can survive that. He's still here. Dr. Fielding's still here! This way! If we get out of this alive, NASA's paying for my therapy. Oh, wow. They're testing plasma rockets. Those things burn hotter than the surface of the Sun. Look, all we gotta do is get this key to Dr. Fielding then you can look at all the nerd porn you want. Dr. Fielding! Dr. Fielding! We have the key, sir. Dr. Fielding, we have the key. - Dr. Fielding. - Dr. Fielding. - Dr. Fielding! - We have the key, sir! Over here. Guys! - Go, go, go! - Dr. Fielding. He's dead, guys. But how? Shoot! We've failed. It's over. I mean... let's be honest, guys. Who do we think we are? Nerd. Criminal. Orphan. A joke. I guess I'll... go try and find my parents. Me too. What are you doing? Look. They didn't even get to open this. Well, since we're all gonna die together, may I propose a toast? Oh, crap. This is from 1969! I mean, could at least get some fresh wine if this is gonna be my first time, right? Citadel, this is Crystal Palace. - What? What was that? - Go! What the heck? Citadel... - Hello? - ...this is Crystal Palace. Do you copy? We're here, over! Citadel, identify yourself. What is your name, ma'am? Over! I'm Alex. How old are you? I'm thirteen. And if you don't mind me asking, who are we talking to? This is General George Khoury at Cheyenne Mountain. Is anyone alive at JPL? Is Dr. Fielding there? There are four of us, everyone else is dead. The astronaut sent us, before she died. You were sent by Major Collins? Yeah, that's why we came. She gave us the key and said something about Excalibur. What, you have the crypto-key in your possession? That's right. What do we need to do to get it to work? Nothing. You need to get out of there. I'm... I'm sorry. It's over. There's nothing you kids can do against this thing. Now get out of there immediately, we're sending two units to pick you... No. - What did you say, son? - I said no. I made a promise I wouldn't let anything stop me. So I'm gonna keep trying and it will be a lot easier if you would help me. We didn't come all this way to give up now. We're done being told what we can and can't do. We made it across half of southern California. - Past aliens and soldiers. - A diddler! Don't forget about the diddler. All the way here. Nobody helped us get here. All we had was each other. So you're gonna listen to me, because we're not kids anymore, and we're the best chance you've got. I'm going to ask you one more time, General. What do we need to do to get this thing working? All right, someone needs to go down to the basement and fire up the emergency generators. Start them in sequence, exactly four seconds apart. Send your fastest, strongest... I'll do it! I'm sorry, that sounded like a young girl. Oh, yeah! Aliens don't stand a chance against her. All right! You need to climb through the vent. The vault door won't open until the power is back on. - Got it. - Look... You're not safe at JPL. - Did you hear the four seconds part? - Yeah. If this doesn't work, I need to make sure... You're gonna need to time it. Take care of it. And yourself. Your father would be proud. What are we doing? What is Excalibur? Excalibur was a Cold War defense project. It was meant to shoot down Russian missiles. Yeah, using fusion pumped X-ray lasers, I read about that. Never mind him. He knows everything. Keep going. The key that Major Collins gave you contains the coordinates of the alien mothership in high orbit. We can destroy the mothership. You're our last hope. Okay, what else do we need to do to get this shit started? You need to realign the satellite dish on the roof, then get a working computer and load the coordinates Major Collins gave you. Then activate Excalibur. - All right, I'll go to the roof. - No, Gabriel. You guys load the programs. I'm gonna go to the roof. Plus you're hurt and he's the only one keeping you alive. What are you talking about? You're afraid of heights! I'm scared of everything. It's my turn. Tell Zhenzhen, I'm gonna want my watch back. And if I die... tell her I love her. Actually, wait... don't tell her I love her, just tell her I was into her. I don't want to freak her out with the "L" word. Just go! Ow! Switches... Oh, my God. That's tall. Don't look down. Don't look down. Don't look down. Don't look down. Switches. Four, three, two, one. Four, three, two, one. Four, three, two, one. Shit, she actually got the power back on. Yes! Okay. Good. Do you see the monitors at the back of the room? Are the control stations working? Yeah. Yeah! - The computers are working. - Excellent. - It's on. - Now insert the crypto-key. I got it. I got it! Okay, did your friend move the dish yet? Uh... No, I see him but he hasn't moved it yet. Then you have to wait before you launch Excalibur. Don't look down. You can do this. Shit! - Alex! - Alex! - Alex! - Activate the PA system. - Alex! - Alex! - Alex! - God? Behind you, look down! - Go, hurry, Alex! - Oh, God! - Oh, he did it! - God! Yeah! Ah! No... No! No! Son, Excalibur needs two people to launch it. Shit, he passed out. Hey, get up! Get up! One of your other friends is going to have to help you. Where are they? I don't know. Alex! Zhenzhen! Dariush is in bad shape and I can't do this alone. Get the two launch keys from the safe locker. Let me know when you're there and I'll give you the code. Oh, no! F... F... Okay. Punch in... nine, six, three, two, two, one, zero, three. Tell me when you've got it open. Uh... No. I said, nine, six, three, two, two, one, zero, three. Fuck! The code, nine, six, three, one... - No, no, no! - Gabriel. I wrote it down for you. I got you, brother. - Oh, my God. Thanks. Thank you. - Hurry up. Okay. Okay. Three, two, two, one... Okay! I got 'em! I got 'em! It is imperative that they are inserted at the same time. Oh, shit, he passed out again. Dariush. Hey. We are running out of time, son! Hey, wake up. Wake up! We are running out of time, son! I can't. I can't! - Gabriel! - Zhenzhen! Come on, we gotta do this! - What do we do? - Right here, okay. - Right here? - Yeah. On my mark, okay? Three, two, one. Come at me, bitch! Come get me, mother... - Come on. - What are you doing? - You can't kill that with a flare gun. - No. But I know what can. Launch Excalibur, then meet me outside. Ah! - Oh, shit, we gotta go! Come on. - Come on. Go! - We gotta try this again. Ready? - Try this again. We gotta put an end to this, okay? Three, two, one, go! Oh, yes! - We did it! - Yes! Now, get out of there immediately. We're sending two units to pick you up. The building is not safe. Yeah! Yes! Come on. Come get me! Warning! Warning! Warning! No, hey. It's too dangerous. But I have to get him. - It's too late. - Alex! No! No! Alex, come on! - Come on! - I can't. - Alex, you can. - No, I can't! - Alex! - No, Dad! Go! - You have to let go. - I'm not gonna leave. - Alex, you have to let go. - No, stop! No! - Don't be afraid. - No! Alex, don't be afraid. It's okay. You can do this. Alex. Please. Please. Alex. Alex! Oh, my God! Yeah! Alex! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Dude, I missed you so much. Did we do it? Did we do it? Whoa! Guys, we did it. Hell, yeah, we did it. - Whoo! Yeah. - Oh, man! Oh, my God. Yeah! I guess you're pretty brave after all. You really think so? Oh, yeah, I'm definitely coming back next year, for sure. We saved the world!
