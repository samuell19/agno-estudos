Isn't it right? No, vice captain. We can't do it. Let's think reasonably. You want me to sacrifice people's life to think reasonably? Do you want everyone to die? Think about it. Your brother Tae-ryeong can be saved. Don't you want to be saved? Why are doing this? Son of a bitch. Stop. -How can we choose? -Stop. -Do you want to die? -Stop. Stop. Everyone, thanks for your persistence. There is tornado over our ship. After it passes, the rescue team can arrive in 14 days at the earliest. If there is no storm in 14 days, the rescue team can work for 24 hours to rescue us. This will be the fastest. The carbon dioxide and oxygen can supply us for 4 days at most. For the most extreme situation, we can stay for 6 days. After that, I won't say anything more. I am aimed at saving as many members as we can. However, we can't save everyone due to the situation. In case, if we can only save half of members or one fourth of members. Or even if we can only save one person, I think this is the right thing. Let's decide. We save half of us or we live together for 6 days and then die together. I can't decide. We will choose the way that more than half of the people support for. What is the blank space? -=Kang Do-young Cha In-ho Kim Young-seon Na Young-woo Lee Sang-hyun Hong Seong-bin Hong Ji-han Seo Jeong-ho Seo Jeong-yeon=- They want to follow your decision. Four people disagree. Four people agree. Other people want to follow my decision. So we decide to save half of the people. -Wait, vice captain. -Brother. No. There are 44 strings. If you choose one, you can't change it. This is the rule. If all officers get short strings, the one who has the highest rank will do the command. Do you understand? -Yes. -Yes. The short strings' will go for sacrifice. The long strings' survive. Over. Next. Next. Take it. What are you doing? Take it now. No need. It's okay, listen to me. Don't do that, brother. Jeon Tae-ryeong. You really don't want to listen to me? Please don't do this! Take it. It's okay. Don't do that again. Jeon Tae-ryeong. Take it! Don't do that again! What happened? You can't change even if you don't want it. That's my right. I didn't approve it. This is an order. Tae-ryeong is my brother. Don't do that. Jeon Tae-seong. This is an order. Navy cannot kill itself. Guys! Don't you all know that? We can't do this! Don't say it again. That's enough. I can't give up. Your orders are so nonsense. I think you are losing you mind. I want to strip the minister of his command. Lieutenant Kim! Imprison him! Guys. Guys! Don't you all know that? Don't you all know that? Guys! That's enough! Captain Jeon Tae-seong. From now on, you are suspended. For what? I want to stop the minister. Imprison him! Imprison him. Minister! Minister! Brother! Wait a minute! Brother! Minister! Minister, please! Just allow us to change the rope. Just allow us to change the rope. Minister! Just allow us to change the rope! Just allow us to change the rope! Minister! We should all have died then. No. Tae-ryeong and I were both dead by then. I regret one thing. At that time, I should have let you change the rope. I'm sorry, Tae-seong. You should know where Seol-young is. Don't you want to know where Sergeant Jang is? She was in the car across from Seol-young. This vest can be cracked. You have 3 minutes. Save one or let both of them die. It's your choice. -=Jeon Tae-seong=- Daddy in the coffee shop. I can't go right now. Uncle, who are you? Kang Do-young! -=Special Use for Fire Engine=- What are you doing? Give it up. -=The policeman-= Where is my Daddy? He'll come here soon. You can't go there! -What happened? -What's wrong with him? You can't go there! Don't come here, Darling! Stop! -No way! -Stop him,please! -It's dangerous! -So dangerous! Darling... Where is Seol-young？ Right ahead. -=Restricted Access=- It's okay. Seol-young, Daddy is coming! I‘m so sorry, Seol-young. Have you made up with Ho-yeon? No, not yet. Why? I have no idea... It's harder than you think, right? Not actually. Didn't you say you wanted to make up with her? Yes. Dad picked this out, didn't he? Yes. I miss Daddy. The reason why I came here, is to clarify the truth of Halla Ship incident. Because of the typhoon and bad weather, it took us 20 days to discover the Halla Ship. In this 20 days... The oxygen inside has been reduced. The oxygen can only be used by 44 people for 7 days at most. In my opinion, if all the people were dead. Then there's no significance for rescue. Twenty-two comrades were died. They didn't died of the collapsed partition wall. It's all about my arbitrary decision. I'm responsible for everything. I'm so sorry. Which country owns the lost torpedo? The Republic of Korea. How much oxygen was left after the rescue? There was almost no left for oxygen. Don't you have anything to say to the bereaved families? Can't you just rescue another people? I should have made another long line. I'm so sorry. If you could go back to that time, what kind of decisions would you made? -=The Tomb of Young-woo=- Did I make the right decision? You must remained steadfast. Take a look at the comrades. It will be much suffering to live. It's my turn. Not that one. I have set the ending. Minister, you must stay. If we run out of oxygen again in the future, we'll have to draw again. Young-woo. All the comrades who have drawn the short line,come here altogether! Minister and comrades. Stop crying. We have to leave decently. If we go down, the rest will have a much harder time. Please make sure to survive. Let's take a reconsideration. There will be other solutions. No other solutions anymore. If it crashes at this moment, everyone of us will die. Minister need to take responsibility of others. I got it. Attention! Put down the hand. We need to leave. -=Kim Hon-chul Jeon Tae-ryeong=- -=26 Warriors of Navy=- Attention! Salute! More Dramas and Movies With Multi-language Subs - ALL IN HiTV -=Decibel=- Hey, where are you going? Come here, photos make the most sense. Get over here! Come here! How to do that? Come here! What's wrong? You're shy, aren't you? No, I'm not. I don‘t really like that, Minister. No,my brother really likes it. Really? Let's take one no matter what. Hey, and... When it's just the three of us, I'll get you all killed if you guys still call me Minister. Call me brother, got it? Yes, Minister. What? What's happening? No, nothing. I say,"one, two". I say "one,two,three" and call me brother. Let's try it, "one,two,three". -Brother. -Brother. Fine, let's gather more people. Get them all over here. -Get them all here. -Go and get them. Yes, Minister. He seems more and more like me. Come on, let's take a photo. One, two, three!
