A fool learns from experience; The sage learns from history ― Otto von Bismarck Seek out Nobunaga I'll smoke him out and chop off his head! The 2nd of June, 1582. Honno temple in Kyoto Mitsuhide Akechi's uprising... led to Nobunaga Oda's exit from history when he was about to unite the country What happened to Nobunaga Oda's body? What was the reason for the rebellion? How did Hideyoshi Hashiba, who subdued Mitsuhide, return to Kyoto from the Chugoku region so swiftly afterwards? The Honno temple incident contains many enigmas English subs by NLK1971 Thanks to Makiko I. - Looks naff. Want it? - Nope "Matchmaking spots", here... Hello It's me. You got there okay? Yeah, I'm about to head to the hotel I've just finished a meeting I've another matter― So straight to dinner? Yeah But it's amazing you booked "Yoshioka"― I can't wait Don't spoil your appetite though - Yoshioka - Okay Avoid snacks Yeah See you later Welcome Delightful This please Thank you, 800 yen These Konpeito have been made the same way since the sengoku era The sengoku era? Yes And they were a favourite of Nobunaga Oda Please go ahead and bite one Oh, so you bite on them 200 yen change Miss Kuramoto Yes Your reservation... is for next month And today? We're fully booked Now what? HONNOJI HOTEL Take care It doesn't work Oh, excuse me It's broken I see Welcome to the Honnoji hotel I'd like a room tonight for two Is there one available? I guess not. Kyoto's so crowded - Actually, another hotel... - Yes― It can be arranged. Here Why is it called "Honnoji hotel"? Perhaps this was the site of Honno temple? No, the site of Honno temple is close to Horikawa block four It doesn't exactly augur well for a hotel If it had another name― "Nobunaga hotel", perhaps Nobunaga―that's a bit ominous too Your room key Thanks Huh? Don't move! You work for the hotel? It's some sort of event? - Peculiar clothing - Peculiar clothing Who are you? What's your business here? - Are you in pain? - Stay back! What is it? Your stomach hurts? My stomach... Stomach? Well, in that case... Have some of this medicine if you like Medicine? Since yesterday I've had this dull pain in my stomach Actually, tonight... I'll be introduced to Kyoichi's parents for the first time So I suppose I'm kind of anxious I... will marry him That's worthy of celebration Actually I've been anxious too I've an important tea ceremony... in front of my lord The thought of making a faux pas is terrifying How is it? The pain's fading Good Where did you get hold of this? You buy it at places like Matsukiyo Oh, you can have it if you want Really? It's much appreciated Strange clothes... You should leave quickly If my lord finds you there'll be trouble Is your master as intimidating as that? He's not just intimidating He's cruel and demonic Really? The other day― Just because a dish served to a guest had a fishy odour... Son of a bitch― Letting a guest eat this crap! I apologise! Here Horrible A master like that can't be tolerated You should quit Quit? No chance Why? Silly I'm not allowed to leave of my own volition As well as losing my head, I'd forever be a laughing stock Your head? Come on Not enough? How many more? Three more's fine That way, that way Lord Otsuka! Who's that? A guest... here for the tea ceremony And a foreigner? Yes! Ah... this way, this way, this way Um, I have an awkward question― What day, month and year is it now? June 1st, 1582 That's what I figured I'd a feeling this wasn't the Heisei era Just keep your head down and stay out of sight The master has arrived Everybody, lift your heads Wonderful specimens Such masterpieces haven't been seen before Our lord surely holds supremacy in this land They seem to be Hatsuhana and Nitta tea caddies Ah, however... the Narashiba tea caddy hasn't been found Soshitsu Shimai, show the item in your possession It's the Narashiba tea caddy! I believe you should present it to the master It was promised that today it's only for display Actually, let me humbly say― This tea container is more important than my life I cannot hand it over, even to my lord Please, please pardon me Soon the country will be unified When that occurs, wealthy merchants will be entrusted with even more trade Think carefully― About what will happen then if you defy me Go ahead Please accept it - Here - Eh? You mustn't be threatened into giving up a prized item I see And your master has plenty more... Insolent person Scoundrel This calls for a beheading You're joking, right? Sorry! I won't do it again Forgive me, I'm really sorry! I beg you, don't kill me! Thank you Room 405 Something wrong? Ah, well... The customer wasn't there Later... I'll be back later You'll see Why? It can't be Why? Um... Do you know a good local shoe shop? It's good? Yeah, unbeatable! I'm glad I'm alive Sorry to barge in So the meal was to your taste? Yes, really delicious Thanks I'm glad I'm alive Don't exaggerate Because... Sorry! I won't do it again I beg you, don't kill me! It's been a while Yeah It appears you come to Kyoto now and then Why don't you visit? My work schedule's always packed I've no time for elegant dining Ah, I see Well, please look after yourself What's that kind of talk for? - Kyoichi, um... - Hmm? Oh, right, this is my father Hello And this is his restaurant I wondered if you'd notice Excuse me - I'm Mayuko Kuramoto - Hello Um, I'm his father It's sultry today Sorry about this― Making you come all the way from Tokyo No, I'm honoured to be invited to your golden wedding anniversary party He says he wants to announce the engagement... and make a fuss about it with his friends He's really hyped up The wedding anniversary seems like a bonus He said the ceremony will be held in Kyoto I may be mistaken I was given to understand it'll be next April I see If it's okay with Kyoichi then I'm fine with that I see Well, the circumstances around your job might get in the way In March... the company I was working for went bankrupt I'm looking for my next place of employment And what kind of job are you looking for? Oh... well Isn't there something you want to do? I don't have any special talent No, not something that you can do― What you want to do What I want to do? I've been summoned Welcome back Um, do you have a tourist guide? Certainly This firm has gone into liquidation Are there any positions you're hoping for? Not really It's advantageous to have a qualification I've a teacher's permit Getting a teacher's licence as a fall back... doesn't do any good these days Teachers are in surplus too How will I make a living now? Let's get married What? It's a bit antiquated but the role's permanent Sounds good But I wonder if it's right when we've only been going a few months It's not right or wrong You've lost your job― You should count yourself lucky That's right Someone like you should just hurry up and marry And you've no real ambitions? Give me one of those It's tasty though― Give me some octopus then Your tourist guide Thank you Um... About this... It seems in the period Nobunaga Oda allowed Christian preaching, it was brought here by missionaries It may possibly have been in Nobunaga's possession Say― Why this current job? I believe it's my vocation I see - Sorry about that - You're late - You've decided? - Movie Land! - Take care - See you later She's not there! You've found her? No, it seems she must be elsewhere now I'll go and search over there Hello there God! Hi, I'm back again Your lord is still angry then He commanded that you be brought before him He'll have you killed Oh dear, I don't want to die Then why did you do that? Because even if you're high and mighty, using threats to purloin a treasured item is inexcusable Who cares about that― Defying my lord is a death sentence Just over one tea urn? It's not just a tea urn He who has the three tea caddies... is regarded as the leading force in the land They represent the nation How can a tea urn be more valuable than a life? That's just how it is. It's the law The girl's here! I'm really sorry― About my indiscretion before No doubt you're angry? How would you like some konpeito? - Here... - That's rude! Step back I'm sorry Wait Where did you obtain them? Ryokujuan Shimizu Bought in town? Yes Don't lie Konpeito are precious― They're not available in town Even missionaries only rarely have them Missionaries? ...in the period Nobunaga Oda allowed Christian preaching, it was brought here by missionaries But I'm surprised you know of our lord's love for konpeito And they were a favourite of Nobunaga Oda Nobunaga―That's a bit ominous too He's cruel and demonic The master has arrived Soon the country will be unified Nobunaga... Oda... Is it possible you're... Nobunaga Oda? How insolent! Address our lord properly Aren't you Nobunaga? So, that's Nobunaga? What about it? So use the proper honorific Amazing! I'm face to face with Nobunaga Oda! And still Huh? Then perhaps... you are... Hideyoshi? No! In that case Ieyasu? N-o! - Akechi? - No! You can't be... Ranmaru Mori I'm Ranmaru Mori I'd a totally different image You Yes Who are you? Where are you from? Edo? I have arrived from Edo As expected, the sengoku era is scary Every day, people kill each other Edo's also war-torn Oh, certainly If we subdue Chugoku and Shikoku, the troubled times will be over Peace is just around the corner Is that so? Go into town and you'll see The people are living happily with benign smiles on their faces What? You can tell me honestly Nobody's smiling I don't know about the world outside But none of the people here are smiling Everyone is anxious and glum-faced― To the extent they're afflicted with stomach ailments They don't seem happy at all You go too far But even you said that Nobunaga is cruel and demonic, didn't you? I didn't! You did though No way! Think back to when we first met... My lord This woman seems a little weak in the head Huh? That's rude Further dialogue is futile― I'll expel her at once Don't Confine her so she won't escape Is he angry by some chance? I'm angry too Eh? Why? Just be glad it isn't a beheading Hey, where are we going? I'm to be imprisoned in a dungeon? We don't do that Liar Castles have dungeons and in this scenario people are locked up I saw it on TV This isn't a castle Be quiet in this place ...in Nobunaga's possession You're Nobunaga oda? This isn't a castle Excuse me Is this place a temple? Indeed Why is Nobunaga here at this temple? Doesn't he reside in a castle? The lord always stays here when he comes to Kyoto It's like a hotel? What? Surely this isn't... Honno temple? This is Honno temple of the Nichiren sect Allure of the Honno temple incident Hey, wait! I have to tell them something! - She's gone - Where'd she go? Welcome back Honno temple incident Nobunaga Oda killed himself 2nd of June... at dawn Mitsuhide's uprising From here we'll head for Bichu Takamatsu castle... as reinforcements for Governor Hashiba Now, we depart! Um, excuse me Actually― I've just seen Nobunaga Oda Ranmaru Mori was there too At Movie Land? Honno temple The real Nobunaga and Ranmaru were there The elevator... is connected to the Honno temple of June 1st, 1582 That must be difficult How do I get there? The elevator doesn't always take me there How do I get to Honno temple? Um, well... It may be better not to go Why? The 1st June, 1582 is the day before... the Honno temple incident It's dangerous If you make a slip up you may well get dragged into it I'll be fine if I come straight back I have to warn Nobunaga about the Honno temple incident Ah, I understand But... then history will be altered You're right I'm just popping out Take care Mayuko! Ah, sorry I'm late She's Mayuko Kuramoto My former classmates Hello Hello, I'm pleased to meet you Try this Aburimochi― It appeared in the Heian era The Heian era... Hey, your tag's still attached Eh? You're careless? Why? You're like that? Mayuko, look Isn't the view of the river lovely? Yes, really lovely A garden party here would be delightful We discussed the wedding party and she suggested here Oh, I see Western and Japanese attire would both be suitable Which is better? A dress suits you much better A dress then... I like it as well― Let's do it here Shouldn't you look at other places? Won't that just cloud the issue? But all girls are different and this only happens once a lifetime Maybe he's right though See―It's easier to let others decide Yeah Ah, it's nice being a newlywed It seems you're good at cooking and stuff - No, not so much - Really? I think I'll do cookery classes - That's nice - Don't bother I can do the cooking. You like omurice, right? I'll make it for you His omurice is damn good - Shogayaki - Yeah, shogayaki! My lord With all due respect, I entrusted the girl to these people Therefore the responsibility's all mine That's enough, retire Didn't you hear? Leave immediately Ranmaru You were the first to find the girl Welcome back After completing kindergarten, you go to primary school When you leave primary school, junior high And then high school, college After that, a job Subsequently― You get married? I thought that's what life was about The company I worked for went under and I couldn't find a new job I thought that I didn't have much choice Sorry, I didn't mean to escape! Follow me Thank you Otherwise you'll be too conspicuous This is the capital The sengoku period It's almost over The era of peace I've longed to bring about is approaching That's... what you've been striving for? Yes I suppose these people would be shocked if they knew who you were In a drama you would be the lead role I'd be an extra Normally, I wouldn't be able to speak to you like this You're an extraordinary person You're trying to accomplish what would be beyond average people Well? You like it? Yes, it's just the same I see The same Who decided? Eh? Who decided it can't be done? Who decided it's quite impossible? A great task such as unifying the country― Not just anyone could do that It's not that they couldn't― It's just nobody tried Nobody tried? What do you want to do? I don't have a big dream like you have Does it matter whether it's big or small? Big and small don't come into it Whether you want it or not― Whether to do it or not― That's what matters However, my retainers... didn't appear to be happy Um... What? Tonight you'll be staying at Honno temple, won't you? In three days we'll head out west ...then history will be altered Let's go I'm coming My lord Where exactly... what's that? I had Lord Nobunaga show me around town He really did that? Here Er... what's this exactly? It seems to be popular with the children in town A game called "Buriburi-Gicho" Buriburi? Gicho? Thank you for your purchase Thanks Mayuko's an obedient one― She's docile and reserved Different from you know who Hey! How about you listen more to her point of view? Huh? There are numerous other party venues She said she didn't have any particular preference I don't believe that What do you mean? I'm sure that Mayuko has something she wants to do (―> Mayuko Kuramoto) The phone you have dialed... is either switched off or in an area without reception Lord Otsuka I'll do it The master! Mr Nobunaga You'll have a go? That's impolite Stay back― I doubt he'll play this vulgar game Come, let's go Okay, I'll explain how it works - This device... - I know Give it This one You hit it! Dead centre! Well done, my lord! To victory! I played often as a child You never lose it Master, once more I won't accept defeat Halt Our destination is not in the west The enemy's at Honno temple! You've something to tell me? Yes... I'm not sure... if I should spill the beans about something like this... But apart from that, it's hard to say whether I can get you to believe me The truth is... I haven't come from Edo Actually... You're from the future You've come here from a future world Haven't you? Maybe not What? No, you're right―It's as you say I've jumped over from a world that's 400 years in the future! It's a strange thing The elevator in the hotel I'm staying at... seems to be connected to this world Do you see? Probably not Was that all you wanted to say? No, no, that's not all If you believe me it makes it easy Well ...then history will be altered Please leave Honno temple immediately Leave Honno temple? Why? Because... tonight, there will be a rebellion Rebellion? Yes Nonsense― My lord virtually rules the country There's no one who'd defy him But there is There's a limit to what even you can get away with saying... Who is it? Who leads the rebellion? Say his name Mitsuhide Akechi You're having us on. How do you know this? I've told you already I came from the future In 400 years hence― What occurs tonight is called the "Honno temple incident" It's no exaggeration to say it's the most famous event in history I've no idea what you're talking about What do you hope to achieve with this fiction... And? What is the result of Mitsuhide's rebellion? You Nobunaga Oda And Ranmaru Mori With Honno temple in flames Both kill yourselves And depart this world It's nonsense! My lord is about to unite the country The dream of so many years is at last going to be realised Suicide? Scoundrel, you've gone too far! I know you don't want to believe it But it's the truth So― Please flee this place immediately Mitsuhide's rebellion Understood My lord, please wait I've... gone and changed history Welcome Kyoichi Going in Kimono? Sorry, I'll just go and change Welcome to the Honnoji hotel Hello there Good evening Kyoichi? He's gone to the hall Ah... I see There's nothing That I want to do Not one thing There isn't really anything at which I excel most other people There's genuinely nothing I want to do Nothing I'm enthusiastic about But It's like― It's bad, isn't it? Being this way You'll discover something, I'm sure Perhaps― Tomorrow even―You'll happen upon something you want to do It's too early... to give up Now, the golden wedding anniversary of Seijiro and Sumie Yoshioka will... Kyoichi, that photo... Yeah It's my mother She died of cancer last year At the time, the anniversary was already being mentioned Mother was really psyched up about it So father and I decided to go ahead with the party Thank you― For making time today... and gathering in such numbers I'm sure that Sumie is delighted too My wife Sumie... gave me constant support down the years In the beginning, we started a small eatery together But without us noticing, it grew bigger and bigger And now... it has turned into a fancy Japanese-style restaurant... by the name of "Ryotei Yoshioka" That we could come so far... is down to Sumie Sumie Thanks a lot Today I have some news for Sumie and all of you At the end of the month, I'll take the liberty of closing Ryotei Yoshioka A little before Sumie died... she said something to me "From now on," "just do what you want to do in life." Upon hearing that, I began to wonder Since becoming a chef, what were my happiest and most enjoyable times? Then it came to me― When I fed penniless students... with cheap, delicious meals that fill the stomach, those students gladly did their best with more enthusiasm than ever― It was upon seeing that With that in mind I've decided I want to open an eatery once again It may be thought... that it wouldn't work out at my age However I think it's not too late I believe I can do it - The young master's here! - Young master! Status is irrelevant How exactly are the people here different from me? They're just the same What name do you go by? I'm Tokichiro Follow me Why a peasant's son like me? I want to build the kind of world where everyone can wear a gentle smile Come It's our victory My lord It's Ranmaru Enter Wait a moment That story of a little while ago― Does my lord believe that Miss Kuramoto actually jumped through time? Until just recently, I didn't realise the world is round And that across the ocean dwell people... with skin and hair of a different colour And I wasn't aware of various things... they'd invented Given that Maybe I just don't know of the presence... of people from the future Don't you think? That may be so Therefore, the world is going to change And eventually a future we can't even imagine... will visit this land Then what do you intend to do? About what? About the rebellion Nothing much I will neither run nor hide I accept my fate and ―without fearing death― will try to uphold the samurai spirit to the end It's truly honourable Ranmaru, be at ease Even if there wasn't a rebellion, what would happen if I were to die now? I dare say... Lord Shibata would become guardian of your son and heir Nobutada However It doesn't seem likely that Lords Niwa and Takigawa would meekly abide by it Elevating Nobutada may lead to a dispute over the succession No Before any of that, it is likely that... Lord Tokugawa would overthrow the Oda clan What's this? Read it and see Nobunaga has died in battle I'll take it to Lord Shibata right away No, not him Monkey It's for Hideyoshi You've been thinking of this ever since you heard that story? He's worthy to suppress the uprising― But why get Lord Hashiba to unify the country? Didn't you intend to unify the country yourself? It doesn't matter who does it My hope is that peaceful times will come to this land Listen, Ranmaru― I will die to preserve the honour of the samurai If you understand, take the note at once Yes! Understood! At least discuss it with me With you? Why? Typical Welcome back Where's the bar? - The seventh floor - Thanks - It's the seventh floor - Ah Why... is it called "Honnoji hotel"? You asked me that same thing previously Did I really? Yes You said it's a name that doesn't augur well for a hotel Why doesn't it augur well? It's where the Honno temple incident happened An incident took place at Honno temple? Mitsuhide Akechi's rebellion failed, didn't it? No On the dawn of 2nd June, 1582 Nobunaga Oda killed himself and Honno temple burnt down History... didn't change? Proceed! Destroy Nobunaga! Excuse me, my lord Akechi, governor of Hyuga―An uprising In the end, father always does just what he pleases We kept letting him have his own way But Isn't he kind of cool? Yeah - Listen - I have to go I'm sorry. Excuse me for a moment What is it? Sorry―Something's bothering me Bothering you? I'll be back soon. Then I'll explain Sorry A good girl An honest kid, that one A car will be here presently― Please go ahead - What is it? - Lead me Please take me to where Nobunaga and Ranmaru are Movieland's closed now... Not there, I want to go to Honno temple Ah, for Honno temple, leave the hotel... No! The Honno temple of 1582! Please tell me how you jump through time I'm sorry I'm not sure what you mean Now I see The konpeito Konpeito? Yes, it's the konpeito! I'm on my way Huh? Why? It's Kyoto wireless Hello - Take care - We're off Seek out Nobunaga I'll smoke him out and chop off his head! Don't attack any patrons―Let them go Wait My lord What is it? This guy was trying to make off with the Narashiba tea caddy What shall I do? This wasn't something I cared about You want it, take it My lord, please leave Pardon me! Where's Nobunaga? You again! My lord, it's Ranmaru Mr Nobunaga Why are you here? I want to ask something What? Why... Why didn't you escape? - Didn't you believe what I told you? - It's not that Then... why not escape? Ranmaru, what's the situation? The enemy is on its way They may break in here any time Leave You're a guest―You won't be killed Even so, be careful And you? I'll be with my lord But I forgot to mention My lord... is cruel and demonic― And I'd follow him anywhere He's my one and only lord Hurry and leave Wait I... almost forgot something important I presume this picture depicts the future world you came from Yes It's called a photo A photo... It's... a nice photo I appreciate it It's time for you to go Now what? It can't be When do I return? What do I do? What happened? Stomach Medicine If he knew... What's that? If Nobunaga Oda had somehow found out in advance... about Mitsuhide Akechi's rebellion at Honno temple―What would he have done? He would instantly have left Honno temple... to avoid danger You'd think so Normally that's what he'd do Yes But If he didn't escape? If he waited... and deliberately accepted defeat by Akechi Why would that be? I've no idea Nor me However One thing I can say― Given it's Nobunaga Oda― He would surely be trying to attain something more valuable than his life Something more valuable than his life... Yes I wish you a good night I'm sorry I'd thought... since you're insecure and unreliable And can't do anything alone― I'd have to take charge From now on, I was going to protect you and make you happy So you don't have to suffer or cry anymore Or whatever I'd no idea father wants to close the restaurant Earlier― After I saw you make out of here― I was thinking Perhaps... I know nothing about you either Well Maybe I wasn't trying to see the real you Let's drop the talk of marriage Besides, to tell the truth When you lost your job Right away I thought it was my chance I took advantage of your weakness I proposed with that unfair attitude - So... - It wasn't unfair I'm at fault I was dependent on you I'm really sorry And where did you go? - Well... - No― It's fine I'm sure there's someone else Eh? No... No doubt, he's... a great guy Yeah He's a really great guy Good morning Good morning Your companion has settled the bill I'm greatly obliged to you Please take this Well then Was your stay at this hotel to your satisfaction? Yes, I'll never forget it Ah, hello It's Mayuko Kuramoto― Registering as a social science teacher Yes. I said that anything's okay But in the end I'd prefer history I'm free to go anywhere― So please help me find something Haruka Ayase Shin'ichi Tsutsumi Gaku Hamada Hiroyuki Hirayama
