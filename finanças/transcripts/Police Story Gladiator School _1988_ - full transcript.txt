-What's up? -Hop in. -RADIO: Six Adam 47, fill warrant on 491, Adam. -This is six Adam 47, roger. Kick 'em loose, they're clean. -Thank you for your time, you're free to go. -I'll tell you -where you can go to. -What'd you say? -Nothin', man. -Get out of the car. -What? -I said get out of the car. Spread 'em. -You're giving me a hard time. I didn't do nothin'. -Don't move. -Come on. -You move, I get nervous. You're a -dangerous man. You threatened my partner. -No, I didn't say nothin'. You didn't say anything threatening? -No, man. -No, you were just being polite to Officer -Ramirez for his courtesy. -Yeah, like that, man. -Man? No, officer. We are officers. -Officer. -No, I think you said something else, something private. You want to find a place where you and I can talk in private? -No, no, that's okay. -I think maybe what you might have said was, "Thank you Officer, for your courtesy. Have a -nice day." -Yeah, yeah, like that, like goodbye. Oh, good. I'm glad we had a chance to talk. I'm glad you had a chance to be heard. Thank you, Officer, for your courtesy. Have a nice -day. -Yeah, thank you for your courtesy, Officer. Have a nice day. I don't believe that. It'll be a while before that garbage bad mouths another cop. That citizen could roll into the nearest station and beef you. What am I supposed to say when Internal Affairs asks me what went down out here? -Hey Steve. -Hey Digby, how's my man? How many dudes did you blow away today? -Six, but I just started my shift. -Ha-ha, you one bad -bull. Hope you're not around if I mess up. -Then don't mess -up. -Okay. Later Stacy. -Later, Digby. Stace, I keep working with you, I'm going to get sucked right into one of your beefs. You got your time left. -You can pull the pin. Me, I'm out of a job. -Pretty dramatic. I think...I think maybe I'll ask the watch commander for a new -partner. -Well, it won't be a new experience for him. Come on, we're behind schedule. Those dregs on Selma will be wondering -why I haven't been by yet. -We wouldn't want -to disappoint them. -RADIO: All units, all units in the vicinity, please respond. Possible 211, Fifth and Snider. Silent alarm. Let's pick that one up. Hurry up. Give me the money, now, get it. Hurry up. -You hit the alarm? -SHOP OWNER: No, man, no, no! Don't. That's right. Just keep that gun trained on me, just like that. If you turn away from me, take that gun off me for a second, I'm gonna pull out my gun and shoot you dead. Move away, lady. Don't! I just told you to keep that gun on me. You give me a chance...there'll be meat on the table ...with a drain at the end of it. I can kill you where you stand. I can kill you and you won't even realize you turned away. -Here, lady. -No! Did you hear me? Dead. Dead if you turn away from me. You give me a chance, and St. Peter's gonna have to send down his shuttle. Come on, lady. Ramirez! Take her. -Don't! -Don't give me that chance. I will not miss. And you will die. You'll die right there. They'll be taping a ribbon the outline of your body right there. I will absolutely kill you. I will kill you. I will kill you. Don't look away. You look away, you die. You won't even feel it. It'll just be over. I'm gonna give you until the count of four. Give me the gun. -One...two... [SIRENS] You should head in and write this up. Do you want me to drive? I was about to ask you the same thing. -Did you hear the board came in on the Donald case? -Mm-hmm. We didn't fire him. He did it to himself. Cop or not, you step outside the bounds, -you pay the price. That's it. -So why is it -eating at you? -This whole Internal Affairs trip is driving me nuts. You know, I'm really tired of snooping on guys I went to the Academy with. Having them turn around treating me like a leper. -Hey, loosen up. You're police to the police. Someone's gotta -do it. -Yeah, but I don't know how I let them -talk me into it. -Like the rest of us. IA duties is a good career move. Hey, it's a two-year hitch. You can take anything for two -years. -Two years. Two years of being called the -head hunter. Terrific, Stan. -We're investigators, that's all. We gather the facts. Someone else rolls the heads if the facts say the heads should roll. We've saved a few along -the way too. -Nice pep talk, Stan. Straight out of the manual. Do you really believe any of that stuff? If I didn't, I wouldn't be here. Do you see what I mean? Look at him. He's scared to death, we haven't even asked him a question yet. Tim Burke? I mean, I wasn't gonna shoot anybody. I just...I said all the words. I was just, you know...I was just trying to get through, right. I just...nothing that I could do would...I mean, I know it was wrong. You know you just...you know, you guys, you don't know what it's like. Excuse me, can I get anyone some coffee? Hey Nance, could you please wait in the other room like I asked you? Please? Listen, it wasn't Tim's fault, it was mine, all mine, and you are treating him unfairly and it's not right. -It's okay. -It's not right. Nance, Nance. It's okay. Excuse me a second. This is none of the department's business. It stinks. It's not professional to show human emotion. -Sorry. -Forget it. We're just trying to do our job, okay? Yeah. Yeah. Well, they could have my job for this. What did Briggs tell you? He said your wife is an alcoholic. You were having a fight about it. He also said you accosted her at the Slumber Land Motel... and that you threatened her with your gun. Well, about two years ago, we lost a baby. And Nance...well at first, you know, a little Brandy would relax her, but then, you know, it got out of hand. And we went to the doctor about it and we went to the church about it, and we'd talk and she'd promise. And over the last six to eight months, she'd be gone days. You know, I'd get calls, wearing my black and whites, pick her up just wandering around or the clerk at some motel wanting to know what to do with her. And after some guy just dumped her... Is that why you were at the motel that day? -Yeah. -Why the gun? Well, when I got there, she didn't even know me, you know. She...she started grabbing me and begging for a drink, telling me all the things that she was gonna do, you know, anything for this drink. And... [SIGHS] I don't know. I just, you know, I just...I put my gun under her chin and I told her that she would be better off dead than the way that she was. I just didn't have anymore words. Hey, Stace. Back there, I mean, you were scared, weren't you? -Scared? Are you damn crazy? -Well, yeah, for a couple of minutes I thought maybe you were. Hey, Dominic! Pull over here. Hey, Stace, you're late today. -Hey Dominic, bustin' a punk. -Just got 'em in. Papayas, I don't get these too often. You tell me what you think. -They look pretty good. Appreciate it. -Let me know what -you think, I'll set you some aside tomorrow, ah? -Thanks, see you then. I'd swear he clocks me coming around that corner. -What's the story? -Oh, it was about a year ago, a couple of punks were doing a Mexican hat dance on his head until I got there and showed them a two-step of my own. You should've been there. -Well, well, Monte baby. -What? Let's check him over. This is Adam 647, put us on code six at Eastern and Third. You like your nights? Come on, you said -you'd make it another 20. -Got yourself a trick, huh? Huh, Lily? -Get out of here. -You're sewer slime. I don't ever want -to see you around here again. -This isn't straight. You just... I'll kill you outside, not here, now get out, you...hey, get out. I'll kill you! Kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. You're busted, freak, you better get used to it. Up and at -'em, Lily. -Let go of me. Let go. I'll get you. If it's the last thing I do, I'm gonna see you in hell. It's none of your -business what I do. -Oh, shut up and get in, Lily. -I lost him, Stace. -It doesn't matter. -I got what I wanted. -Well, who was he? Or better, why was I -chasing him? -Monte is Lily's pimp. -What's the charge? -I'll come up with something. Come on. All right, stand still now. Right there. Smile pretty, sweets. All right, Lily, pick it up. Now look, darling, you're gonna get printed. And if we hassle, you're gonna get -that mascara smudged, maybe break a nail. -Buzz off. -Lily Pantages? -The one and only. Bivens, IAD, I understand you want to make a complaint. Yeah, I got a beef for a brute cop by the name of Chick Stacy. Pine and Draper, Adam 39. This is very nice. We've got a frustrated aircraft designer amongst us? Would anybody like to claim it? No? So much for children's hour. Adams and Ray, six Adam 21. Fortune, Kowalski, you're on 35. Nice you could join us, Stacy. I thought so too, Sarge. -Ramirez. -Yes, sir. You're on 47 with Baxter. Jefferson and -Frank, six Adam 63. Gonzalez... -New partner, huh? -Ask and you shall receive. -Well, that's the -way it goes sometimes. -Stacy. -Yo. -You're in a one-man car tonight. Six lima one. Six lima one, you got it. Okay, are there any questions? Well then let's hit the field. -Stace. -Look, for the record, I told the watch commander we had a personality glitch. You bet. You might have learned how to do some righteous police work. Stace. Wait up just a second. I want to talk to you. -What's up, Sarge? -I put you on that L-car for a reason. We've got company for you and I figure you're gonna be -tied up at least half the watch. -What company? That prostitute you busted, Lily, she beefed you, Chick. IA is downstairs. Can you give me one hint why you can't at least try to prevent some of these beefs? Your package is as thick at the Metropolitan yellow -pages. -Then quit takin' them. It's a waste of -paper to listen to those gutter crawlers. -You're still living in the dark ages, Stace. There's no more running 'em out of town by sun down. Remember that the gutter crawler's got the same rights as the upstanding citizens, and maybe these beefs will stop pouring in here. Well, I apologize for not seeing the new light, Sarge. But just look at the facts. My beat is clean, not like the rest of the garbage pile. And I'm gonna keep it that way. Bivens. Petrelli. Haven't we danced this dance before? Sit down, Stace. You know what this is about? Don't need to tell me, it's about the hooker I busted yesterday. -Do you want to take it from the top? -There isn't much to it. I was on a routine patrol. I see this Monte Fontaine floating out of a building. That's the lady's pimp, two and two said he delivered a trick. He disappeared in the smog. I nailed her. End of story. -Lily alleges excessive force. -Is that all you guys have on me? I used only that force necessary to bring her into -custody. -Now that is getting to be a pretty stale description. Well, that's the way it came down. Now are you gonna believe that skuzz, or are you gonna believe a police officer who's trying to keep his street -clean? -Hey, don't you wave the flag at us. We know better and so do you. I deny excessive force. Now if you guys had any evidence or any witnesses, you would have come down on me before now. So since you boys -are through... -Sit still, Stacy. We'll talk about what you -didn't have. Probable cause to check out Lily. -Bivens, you're a -lawyer now, huh? -Spotting her pimp isn't enough. The door to Lily's apartment says it was crashed into it, that's excessive force. -No knock and notice. -844 of the penal code, again for the -courts. I nailed her, didn't I? -Did you? That wasn't even close to a righteous bust. The city attorney wouldn't file. -We had to let her go. -There's always next time. Which brings us to Lily's next charge, harassment. When Lily stops breaking the law, I'll stop doing my job. Damn it, you knew there was no way this could ever stand up in court. You just figured if you busted Lily's chops long enough, she'd -go do business someplace else. -And wouldn't that -be a shame. Oh, Stacy, come on. You know you've only got a little bit of time until your 30 years are up. Why don't you put your feet up on a desk and relax a little bit till your time's in? Because the streets are what I do. And even you turkeys know -that's how it has to be done. -We're gonna have to talk to Lily again. Well, if there's anything to what she says, the report will pass on to the captain. I guarantee you. He'll give you a choice, a desk or suspension. Suspension for Lily? [LAUGHS] If that ever happens, you'll really see me come through some doors. Have a nice day. Hey, don't look so down. It stays our little secret. Come on, baby, I know how to make you smile. I felt bad about forcing it, baby. But when you said you didn't want to see me anymore, well, girl's got to live. Ain't like blackmail. This way I don't have to work and you get to keep me all to yourself. You worried about that fink cop, Stacy. Don't, he won't be here till night. I keep track of him now. You know... Police Story will continue in a moment. Butch. Briggs. -Huh? -Are you the Sergeant Briggs that made out the complaint against Tim Burke? -Well that depends -on who I'm talking to. -From IAD, we're handling. Well, sure. Yes, that kind of conduct. I made it right out. -Why? -Why what? Why'd you burn it? Why didn't you just give him a transfer and forget about it? The guy's trying to hang close to home, help out his wife. She's been sober since it happened. They just hit a low point. They're getting her help, they're working it out, man. He committed an assault. If I handle something like that informally, I can forget about my next promotion. Well, can you weigh up a ladder, Briggs. Hey, I don't need to take that garbage, especially from you. I mean, what else are you doing in IA but trying to make rank, huh? That's right, that's what we do. What is it? Twenty heads and you trade 'em in for a set of silver bars? It's that and a Captain Marble decoder ring? You're here alone? You don't have any family or anything or what? No? That's it. I've been coming out here for years now. You got business in this neighborhood? I'm not doing anything, not breaking some law. Well, maybe not. But then again...I tell you what. -Yes, Officer. -I'll give you a choice. You can either walk away like right now, or you can crawl away and be out of business for the next month. You pick it. Faster. [GUNSHOTS] What's the rumble? Everyone's talking like Stacy's got it in the fat. Well, he's saying he took Lily out after she tried to snipe him. -Yeah, so what about it? -There's no gun. -What? -No gun. Can't find a piece. Chief Powers, do you think you'll be able to give us any information on what happened here tonight? There's rumors that there -was an unauthorized shooting... -Okay, right now I -know as much as you do. Nothing. -Is that officer that was involved... I'll talk to him. All right, come on, Stacy. -What went down? -Chief, I told the shooting team, I'll tell you. This thing is getting blown way out of shape. They tell me the girl beefed you yesterday. That's right. And she also shot at me an hour ago. Now they just have to keep on digging. There's a gun. Chief, there has to be a gun. I'm having two detectives drive you to the station. -Then what? -You'll be relieved from duty pending the investigation. Office Stacy, can you tell us what happened? Word is you have a bit of a heavy -hand, is that true? -What'd you say? Well, according to the neighbors... -Why is it I'm nervous? -Oh, I don't know. Maybe it's because of our big head hunter -reputation. It's all image, Dave. -What he's saying -is, we don't really bite. -I hear you're talking to the guys at the division about Stacy. Why? Isn't the DA handling the -investigation. -Yeah, well we've been asked to help out on a small part of the overall picture. So we'll be concerned with Stacy's job performance. That's what we're asking you about. -His beat was clean, crime was down. -Well, you worked -with him, Dave. What kind of guy was he? -I'm not sure I have the right to answer that question. Look, I know Stacy's in deep, and I know the DA hasn't made a decision yet. But what I think or what I don't -think shouldn't have anything to do with it. -Well, the DA -thinks it does, or we wouldn't be asking. -A lot of the troops we've had marching in and out of here, they say that you didn't have -any deep love for Stacy. -Okay, but there are a lot of people I -work it. I'm not going to rave about it, you know. -Specifically, why -did you dislike him? -Hey, I didn't dislike the guy. Just his style and mine were different, that's all. But I've only been on the force a little over a year. Maybe with a little more experience, I would -have understood him better. -Understood what? -His methods? -I guess. -Specifically. -All right. Sometimes he was heavy-handed. I guess times changed and Stacy didn't want to change it with him, so he found other ways to keep his beat clean. And it was those other ways that turned you off. But he had a feeling for people. If you were straight, he was straight. Saw a lot of -that side to him too. -You've written out enough to change your -mind about him, huh? -Bivens, Petrelli. Who gave you guys the authority to go to the police psychiatrist in the Burke -case? -I thought it was a necessary part of the -investigation, Lieutenant. -You did, did you? Officer Burke is considered stable. Under traumatic personal circumstances, he exhibited a moment of abhorrent behavior. His subsequent approach to his problems indicate an admirable for level of -maturity in the fitness to duty. -Well, without the embroidery, that's what I thought too. Now we got an expert to verify it. That is a decision for the brass, they decide if he goes to a shrink. If, just if they wanted to get this character fired for a lot of reasons you may know nothing about, you've made it just a little -more difficult for them. -Well, they got all the facts to make a -decision. -No, they've got the investigative facts and a shrink's opinion. You got him stuck if they want to make a move. Do me a favor, hm? Stick to the Stacy case. Don't go off on anymore tangents. See? See what playing white knight around here does for you? -Maybe we saved the kid's job. -Oh, you think he's gonna thank you for it? No way, pal. He's gonna thank the shrink. You are still a head hunter. -Hey Stacy, how you doing? -Well, I guess I need a rest, huh? -You know Baxter? -Yeah, sure, Baxter. I'm kind of surprised seeing you here. Well, I got suspended but my bills continue. I've got -business with the credit union. -I thought you'd be out living the good life, getting in some golf. I don't know how to play golf. Maybe after this Mickey Mouse stuff -is over, I'll learn. Yourself? -Well, you know, I mean, fighting the fight. We gotta roll. -Yeah, I guess... -Good to see you, Dave. Yeah, you too. Hey, I'll see you soon, huh? -Yeah, see you soon. -Hey. It's all -gonna turn out okay. -Yeah, sure. -A guy like that out of the job, what does he do? -God knows. Right now outside of Chief Powers'... I don't give a damn how loud the press is screaming, you have -got to give it a full investigation. -What do you think -we've been doing for the past month, Dave? -You still haven't -found that pimp, Monte Fontaine. -No, but the -street word is he left town after Lily's death. -Stacy thinks he's -important to us... -Important how? Stacy can't tell us why he's important. Only the fact that he was Lily's pimp. It means no one was closer to her than Monte. He might have -answers if we ask the right questions. -It doesn't make a -defense. -I still think you're being premature. -You're moving too fast. -Too fast? My phone doesn't stop ringing. We have a body with two of Stacy 's bullets in it, absolutely no way to show self defense, and everything in the world to give him motive. Now you show me some other areas to look in and I'll be more than -happy to do it. -Right now I can't come up with any. Well, neither can I. -There they are. -Here they come. Do you have a statement for us? The district attorney's office, in cooperation with the police department, has completed a thorough investigation. It has been established that there does exist sufficient evidence to file a criminal complaint against Officer Charles in the shooting death of Lily Pantages. He will be charged with murder in the first degree. Some quiet, please. Sergeant Bivens, do you recall meeting with Lily Pantages approximately three months ago on the third day of April? -Yes, I do, ma'am. -And what was the substance of that -conversation? -She alleged misconduct by Officer Stacy. What form of misconduct? Excessive force, illegal entry, harassment. And did you subsequently investigate these complaints? -Yes, ma'am. -And what did you find? There was some physical evidence of forced entry. Have there been other complaints against Officer Stacy? -Yes, ma'am. -How many? Two? Three? -Eleven. -Eleven. Thank you. Officer Bivens, is it true that suspects often complain against an -arresting officer? -Yes, sir. So that a particularly effective officer might, as a matter of course, accumulate more complaints than another officer, is that not so? -Well... -In terms of his record, would you term -Officer Stacy an effective officer? -I have to say -yes, absolutely. Very effective. -Thank you, Officer Bivens. -You may step down. -In what manner -did Officer Stacy threaten you? -With his nightstick, is how. He made it very clear, I either left the neighborhood immediately or he would have used his stick on me. In other words, it was obvious he didn't want you hanging around. Correct. I can see why now. He didn't want any witnesses when -he killed that poor girl. -I object. Sustained. The last remark will be stricken from the record. The jury will -disregard the last statement. -I have no further questions to ask this witness, your Honor. -State your name, please. -Ralph Thomas. And you are an investigator for the -district attorney's office? -Yes, ma'am. You testify that you investigated Officer -Stacy's assertion of a self defense situation. -Yes, ma'm. Officer Stacy insisted the three shots were fired at him from the upstairs window. -Naturally, we look for a gun. -Naturally. Did -you find the gun? -No, ma'm. -Any evidence of a gun showcasing? -We did a thorough search with -magnetometers, no slugs in the area. -Any evidence of bullet fragments in the street, in the area where Officer Stacy says he was -standing? -No, ma'am. Yet Officer Stacy says that Lily fired at him. Isn't there some sort of test that will detect whether or not a person has fired a gun? Yes, ma'am, a paraffin test. The skin of the hand is impregnated with nitrates from the gunpowder and we can detect these -nitrates. -Was such a test performed on the body of -Lily Pantages? -Yes, ma'am. As far as we can determine, Lily -could not have fired any gun. -Thank you. Investigator Thomas, did you consider that a second party may have been in the room at the time who took the gun? -Yes, sir, but we could not determine that. -But could there -have been a second party in that room? -If there was, none -of the neighbors saw him. -Well, I assume you checked the room thoroughly for fingerprints and the like? The room saw heavy traffic, sir. The only lifts we got were bits -and pieces, or Lily's. -But you didn't find fingerprints. And there could have been a second party in that room. -It's possible. -Now Officer Stacy insists that three shots were fired at him. Did you question the neighbors? -All they said, sir, was a lot of shots. -And how many -shots were fired by Officer Stacy? -Three. Couldn't most people remember three shots? And save the term a lot for say, six? Nothing further, your Honor. -The witness may step down. Ms. Willis. -The people call -Officer Dave Ramirez. -Do you swear the testimony you're about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God? -I do. -Now as I understand it, Officer Ramirez, you were transferred to the Allandale division in -March of this year? -That's correct. -With whom were you assigned? -Officer Stacy. -The defendant? -Yes, ma'am. Were you satisfied working with Officer Stacy? Just yes or no, Officer Ramirez. Were you satisfied working with Officer Stacy? -No, ma'am. -No. In point of fact, you asked for a -change of partners, did you not? -Yes, ma'am. Could you tell the court why you asked for the change? I assume you know that you were not the first of Officer Stacy's partners to make such a request. Would you tell us why you did? -Excuse me, miss. Stacy seemed to know you. -Is that so? I'm sorry, I'm an investigator on the case. Is there anything that... No, I don't have anything to do with his trouble. -I don't understand. -There's nothing to understand. I thought I should be here, but I realized I was too late. Years and years too late. I was an effective cop. Yeah, I bent a few rules, but my beat was safe with decent people. The dregs, well, that was a different story. But nobody was shot by me that didn't try to kill me first. It's about as straight as I can be. -Nothing further, your Honor. -Ms. Willis. Office Stacy offers no new evidence, your Honor. The case speaks for itself. -Objection. -Sustained. Ms. Willis, save your remarks -for summation. -The people see no need for cross examination, your Honor. Would you summon the jury? Have you reached the verdict? -Have you reached a verdict? -We have, your honor. The defendant will rise. It is the verdict of the jury that Charles Stacy be found guilty of murder in the first degree. Sentencing will be set for three weeks from today. The defendant will be held in custody until that time. Court's adjourned. Stacy. Look, I'm sorry. -I could tell when you were on the stand. -It was the truth. -There was nothing else. -Look kid, you find that pimp, Monte Fontaine, and you find out what the real truth is. Can you believe that turkey judge finally convicted somebody? -You really did a number on me. -Anything you want. -Anybody you want to get a hold of? -No, there ain't anybody. -Stace, the other day, that girl. -I just told you, there wasn't anybody. -Who was she? She used to be my daughter. Police Story Police Story will continue in a moment. It's hard see you get this, Stace. -Aaronson. -In the flesh. More than we were a couple rookies walking the beat. -That got old. -What are you doing here? My job. I got to get you ready for the bus. -You got hurt? -No, I asked for this job. A few years back, I asked for a pole job to finish off my 30. They gave me this. -A pole job, you? -Couldn't handle the street anymore. When we started, Stace, I don't know. People said hello. Kids looked up to you. Trouble on the corner, a kick in the key centered on its way. All of a sudden, I was a pick. All of a sudden, I had to be half of a -lawyer. -Yeah. Pretty easy to get disgusted, huh? I got scared. A couple of beefs against me, see. Well, the young guys seemed to handle it, but I couldn't make the right move. I started worrying I'd come up against the wrong beef that they'd pull my pin or I didn't get...like you. A couple of minutes, the bus will be ready to roll downstairs. They'll take you to Gladiator School. -Gladiator School? -Jacksonville. That's what they call it. That's what it is. Rules. I know the rules. Go ahead, hands and feet. All's I want my 30. My daughter and her husband have a place upstate. There's a couple of acres near there. It's cheap living up there. -Sounds really good. -Chick Stacy was tough, but a murderer? I don't believe it. And what if he is...innocent, -I mean. -Chick Stacy was the last of the -hardliners. -But he still could be innocent. -Could be, so? -So we should do what we can. -Which is what? What do you want from my life, Ramirez? -I think we should re-open the case. -Wait a minute, -aren't you the guy who testified against him? -Yeah, I testified. And what I said was his methods were not my methods. I did not -say he was a killer. -Dave, these things are up to the DA. They already got that conviction. You might as well forget it. Well maybe Internal Affairs should retract the case. -Come on, you're still green. -Those IA guys have no interest in anything but nailing cops, not helping. -There's no way, Dave. -Yeah, well I just can't let it lay, all right. Something about Stacy. I just can't let it lay. All right, step in, gentlemen. First six against the wall. Second six, up front. Men near the wall, turn and face me. Officers, remove the shackle. Open up! All right everybody, over to R and R. Single file, move it, let's go. Come on, hustle, hustle. Pick it up, come on. Lock up. All right, listen up. Some of you have been through this before. But for the new faces how it's gonna be. For now, you keep your mouth shut, you do what you're told. Any questions, you hold for orientation. Questions are a counselor's job, they're not mine. Here, you're gonna be checked in, given a fish it, towels, sheets, toilet articles, and a copy of the rules. Now any of you who are carrying balloons, either drugs or money, give them up now and make it easy. Okay, everybody, into a cubicle and drop the duds. Hey homeboy, see that dude over the second cube? He's a cop. Hold it. All right, let's go. Orientation's in north block. You put up there for a week or so till you're classified. He's dead. -I feel you guys owe it to him. -We owe him? -Where do you get off with that? -Because there's no one else. We've been through it. -The evidence doesn't change. -Stacy thought that pimp -Monte was the key. -How could he be? -He hasn't been seen since the day you chased him. -Well maybe that's it. He's running. Why else would he disappear if he didn't -have something to hide? -Why do you want to help Stacy? Well maybe I feel like I shortchanged him. -Oh, come on. -Because he was a cop, and hell of a cop too. I'm not saying he wasn't out of step, but if you guys had to yell for help, do you see me coming running with my Miranda card or Stacy who grabs trouble by the throat? He's a cop, and we should give him all -any cop has coming. -And you don't think that happened? The DA ran the investigation. The media and power pressures had him convicted just as effectively as the evidence. You guys once told me that IA cuts both ways. All I'm asking is that you at least take a look. Will you do it? Will you give him one more shot? You know what kind of man Stacy is, black and white, no gray. Hang 'em at dawn and no cussing or throwing at the women folk. Now that may be extreme of him, old fashioned, but it's kind of moral in its way. Well, you're right about that. Stacy is a man who believes in -right and wrong. -And would a man like that believe in murder? About time. -Get out of here. -Orientation told me it's supposed to last -a week. -They don't know what to do with you. -Where am I going? -To see the warden. Let me tell you, that's special. That's never done. Escort! Look at this, it's like a checker board. It never used to be like this. The group of blacks over there call themselves the black guerilla family. Over there, that bunch, part of the Mexican mafia. Stay away from them, they might leave you alone. And the whites are ganged up too. They call themselves the Aryan brotherhood. Talk sense, Stacy. I'm talking sense -to you and you're busting my chops. -I don't want -protective custody, Warden. I don't want it. -You said that. You've been saying that. And your counselor and his lieutenant couldn't talk you out of it, so they dropped it in my lap and I'm telling you, -you're dead without PC. -I got to be here. I've got to make it here. -Please, Warden. Don't make me special, please. -You're special. You know, the cons knew about a cop on campus before most of my staff did. It's their world. It's gonna be very uphill for you. -Speech, warden? -I don't need your permission. It's my responsibility. You've got to have protective custody. Prison within a prison, uh-uh Warden, I got too much time. -In PC, you'll be alive. -You put me in population, I will do the best time possible. You put me in PC, and I will -raise all the hell I can. -What am I beating my brains out for? One cop who went bad? You want mainline? You got it. C-block. What's the use of talking? -Here he comes. Boy or girl? -Open C-block. Number seven, that's your house from now on. Close C-block. Nice to see a familiar face. Well, don't you remember me? Yeah, sure, bar and grill in the boulevard. You kicked an old lady senseless. Then empty the cash register. I nailed you on the way -out, how's that for recall, Rafferty? -Just wanted to -be sure we all remember. -When I nailed you, I was doing my job. And you had it coming. Now you're of no interest to me. What do you say we -leave it at that and we do our time? -Sure, we can -let it go at that. -Good. But we won't. Out of there, out of there. Out of there. All right, out of his cell. What's going on? -He tripped. -Who threw the first punch? Like the man said, I tripped. You just walked in here, so I'm going to set you straight. I know a hell of a lot more about what goes on around here than you think I do. Happens again, I'll put you both in the hole with the beat, got that? All right, play time's over. -Lock 'em down. -C-block, lock up the count. Move it. Closing. Home, sweet home. Bivens, tell me why that drunk driving case is two days late? -It's in type writer, Lieutenant. -Uh-huh, where's -Petrelli? -He's up at R and I, he's checking out some -packages. -Like this one? That's what I thought, Fontaine, Monte. You guys are nosing into the case. Is that why your -other cases are falling behind? -We're just trying -to keep everything going, Lieutenant. -It is over, Stanley. Stacy is in the joint. That is a criminal matter and it is none of -our business. -It's gotta be somebody's business -because nobody's interested. -No, I think there's more to it than that. You don't know if is guilty or if he's innocent. You're just trying to make something happen. You think I don't know? You think I haven't been through this? You're just trying to live with yourself, Stanley. Why else would you be doing -this? -Because there's some doubt. -The jury didn't find any. -Well, I have some. -And Ramirez has some doubts. -Don't let those other cases slip too far. Bivens. That young cop you got off the hook, with the alcoholic wife. -Tim Burke? -211 downtown turned into a shoot-out. Burke is credited with saving his partner's life and taking the suspect's all by his lonesome. You bailed out a hell of a cop. -Thank you. -I'll let you have it about the bad ones, I guess you got a reckon to know about the good ones too. This is the fourth time we've been back to this dump. We keep looking and looking, we'll never find -anything. -I'm trying a new approach, okay? We're cross, Stan. Why are you doin' this? -We're doing this. We're partners, remember? -My next question. I thought maybe you're gonna put in a request for a new partner -like that kid Ramirez. -What are you, jealous? Oh, come on, I don't know why. I mean, maybe it's the way this kid was able to stand up after putting in for a new partner and taking the stand. I just think -Ramirez got a lot of moxy. -Moxy. Moxy? -Come on, Stan, nobody's had moxy since the '50s. -Hey, maybe that's what's wrong with this world. Lab wards have been through this place already. What is Parks gonna find that -they didn't find before? -You sound like the civilians that think SID guys are Sherlock Holmes. They do what the officer on the scene says. He says look for a gun, that and routine dusting for prints is all they do. So I asked Parks to look for something else. -Such as? -I'm working backward. Assuming Chick Stacy told the truth, that he was fired at from Lily's window. Based on the trial, that's far out already. The evidence says Lily did not fire a gun. So what are you saying? What? Somebody -else fired from the window. -Right, go with me on this. Now look, I don't know who or why. Let's say I'm somebody who wants to draw fire from Stace. I fire at him. But, because you're magic, there were no bullets. That the lab -wards did check for. -Right, I fire, but instead of bullets. Blanks. Blanks? Come on, Stan, that's really reaching it. I can tell you boys right now there's no wad from a blank here. -You sure? -You know, a wad's just that, a wad. When you fire a blank, it comes out in one piece, like a plug. It would be -big enough to see. -Well, even if you don't find the wad, -there'd be little bits, fiber, wouldn't there? -Well, here are your fibers. They could be from a blank or from her clothes, anything. Wait a minute, the fiber from a blank would be impregnated with -gun powder, right? -Right. That's it. Run a test on the fibers. If we come up with a positive test, -what do you look for, nitrates? -But I know we'll -find nitrates in those even without testing. -What? Why? Because there are nitrates in the dust in this room. Then that proves a gun's been fired in here, right? Wrong. The park up the block, I smelled it when I went by. The parks department fertilized it probably less than a week ago. Nitrates from the -fertilizer, they're in the air. -Don't tell me. The same nitrates that are found in gun powder, right? Can come from a lot of places. If we gave you a paraffin test after you had fertilized your lawn, you'd come out looking like you'd been using a machine gun. You've led a charmed life, so far. You better watch me, Rafferty. One of these nights I'm gonna -get you. -Hey, Albert, looks like they've got your favorite today. I'm your friend, Albert. I found out something for you. You see that guy? Over there. He's the guy that raped your baby sister, Albert He's the one. Albert just found out he has a sister. I'm gonna crush you. Would you like a biscuit? Somebody contact 601-30 on Jackson. -I got it. -What's up? We've got to brainstorm. We need a wadding to prove a blank, right? Only there's no way it's in that room. Now to fire a blank from a window, where would the -wad go? -Where would it go? Hell out the window, -but the yard's been searched. -Yeah, but what if it didn't get that far? It's here. It can't be anyplace else. Out the -window and into here. -Dave, are you sure you don't have to -pay a visit to the shrink? -When was the -last time it rained? -Who knows? -A couple months ago. -Yeah, something like that. Oh great, you -could get sued. -All right, look out man, here it comes. Give me a hand, would you? Turn the hose on the other end and tilt the -drain up. -If I ever canned up, I want you on my side. -Bingo. -So you got a wad out of a drain pipe. Yeah, the lab confirmed it came from a -blank cartridge. -I can't see that proving much of anything. It's not somebody, probably Lily's pimp made Stacy think he -was being shot at. It's self defense. -Of course there's no way to date a wad to find out when it was fired. -No, but that's it. Stace is innocent. -You make a lousy -lawyer. -Thank you. -Look, you guys are friends of Stacy's right? -Not exactly. -Okay then, fellow officers. -Yes. And this fellow officer is now in jail and the only thing that stands between him and freedom is a wad from a blank cartridge? -So what's your point? -My point is a -judge could be skeptical. -Are you saying we manufactured this -evidence? -I'm sure you're not going to tell me that a couple of cops, one of them Stacy's ex-partner, couldn't start feeling sorry for Chick Stacy? After all, what's one dead Lily against a -brother officer? Lily the scum, Lily the garbage. -Ms. Willis, that -damn sure is exactly what we're trying to tell you. -You bring me a murderer, guys. You think Monte Fontaine did it? Great. You prove it. If you get me some hard evidence, I'd be glad to trade you a pimp for a cop. Otherwise, you'll excuse me, please? Last week, San Francisco, says they ran a lead down on Fontaine. Now he was there already. -But the word is he's back in our town. -We're gonna -need all the help we can get to find him. -There's one thing I don't get. Why would Fontaine kill one of his big money sources? Let's find out. I know exactly what he'll tell you. Lies! He was no different than any officer in the wardroom. They were all disloyal. I tried to run the ship properly by the book but they fought me at every turn. If the crew wanted to walk around with their shirttails hanging out that's all right, let them. Take the tow line. Defective equipment, no more no less, but they encouraged the crew to go around scoffing at me and spreading wild rumors about steaming and circles. And then old yellow stain. I was to blame for Lieutenant -Merrick's incompetence... -Watch the picture. Lieutenant Merrick was the perfect officer but not Captain Queeg. Ah, but the strawberries! That's where I had them. They laughed at me and made jokes, but I proved beyond the shadow of a doubt, and with geometric logic, that a duplicate key to the wardroom icebox did exist! And I'd have produced that key if they hadn't pulled Caine out of action! I know now they were only trying to protect some fellow officer and...naturally, I can only cover these things from memory if I've left anything out, why, just ask me specific questions and I'll be glad -to answer them one-by-one... -No further questions, sir. For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow that nobody can deny, that nobody can deny. Lights, hit the lights! Now! Guards, hit the light. Who did this to you? Hey, come on, talk to me. Hey. Go to the hospital, get a gurney over here fast. Turn around and face the wall. Now, move. Take 'em down. Move them back to their houses and lock 'em down. Police Story will continue in a moment. -Ramirez, what's going on? -He's still -inside. -You couldn't have gone out the back? No, I got Baxter covering the rear. All right, I'm gonna go in -and jam him. -Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what's -that supposed to mean? Sit in the car and wait? -We wear our suits, but we're still cops. We can make our own arrest. Well, I know you guys have been out of it for a while... Hey, that ain't Jack the Ripper in there, that's Monte. I think we -can handle one little pimp, all right. -What? -Thank you. -Thank you. -Hey man, what's the... -Get up. Get up and get straight. -Hey man, why you gotta fight with me? -Monday. -What? -Monday morning, you and me at the -Academy, jogging to get back into it. -Okay. -Straighten up. -Nice catch. -Take him down to the station. Monday. -Okay, Monday. I didn't do Lily. I didn't. The cop did it. -Then why did you skip? -Look, I didn't need no trouble, all -right? Lily's dead. Who knows? Maybe I'm next. -Why would you be -next? -I don't know. I just wasn't gonna hang -around and find out. -Well, now if you didn't ice Lily and -the cop didn't ice Lily, who did? -Lily's business, it could have been anyone of a hundred different weirdos. -A trick? -Maybe. I mean, most of them do have -something to hide. -You ran from the apartment, who was with Lily? -Just some guy that I picked up on -Maine. He hit on me, so I took him to Lily. -What'd he look -like? -Just like a hundred others. -Let's get the police artist on it. -Hey, I didn't -say I remember what the guy looked like. -You try, or I might remember those lies about the business you're in. -You got a visitor. -Visitor? Yeah. Hi, Betty. I'm surprised and happy. But I didn't expect to see you here. Well...well, I -tried. But I couldn't stay away. -Betty. I had to see you. Don't ask me why. God knows what for. -Maybe I knew there'd be no one else coming. -I wanted to talk -to you at the trial. -After 15 years? Listen kid, I thought about you. I really thought about you, honest. Yeah, right. Mom said you always sent Christmas money. Maybe it was my job, maybe I just didn't want to get in your way. -Maybe your stepfather's a nice guy, huh? -Yeah, he is. But you know something? He didn't look to knock the world over and try to save it. All he wanted was a little time with his family. And you know what? I think he's great. How's your ma? Is she happy? Good. I got married. I'm expecting. And don't bother looking, I'm not -showing yet. -Congratulations. Thank you. -A lot of things have happened, kid. -Yeah. A lifetime happened. I married a ski bum. We have a little shop up in the North Country. We just get by, but I think it's gonna be great for the baby. That sounds like it'll be fine for a baby up there. -Well, look, do you want anything? -Mm-mm. Kid, I wasn't there for you. I never realized how much it was gonna hurt you. I'm sorry, kid. What the hell are you guys doing here? -Would you believe we're trying to help? -What's that mean, help? Now don't trip over yourself with gratitude. Here's what we got. You make him? -Could be anybody? -This is important. Pretend you're -in Lily's apartment. -The day I rousted Lily? That was a trick. -Who is he? -You tell us. -Who talked up the sketch? -Monte. You guys have got Monte Fontaine? Hey, what's happening? What's -happening? -Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down. -Fontaine has an alibi for that night. -Can't be. -He was in a bar, 20 people saw him. -I'm not buying it. -We checked it. He's eliminated. -Let's just -concentrate on the trick. -The trick had no beef with me. -Well, maybe he had a beef with Lily. -You mean that he sniped at me from Lily's room? That's going around a long way just to kill a -hooker, isn't it? -Maybe he wanted two birds with one stone. Well, look, we'll work up the portrait and we'll see what turns out. I thought the department dropped the investigation after the trial. -They did. -Ramirez pushed it open again. Ramirez? Well, I'll be damned. Is that all you guys got to go on? Bits and pieces. -Not enough to convince a judge you're innocent. -Enough to convince you? Enough to keep us trying. Appreciate it. I really appreciate it, thanks guys. -Again? -See him? -Same answer I gave you last week and the week before, no. -Come on, Sammy. -I'll bet you're not looking hard enough. -Maybe we should -jog a few memories. -Hey, look, what's this thing? I swear he's not been in here. Maybe he doesn't like my kind of place. -He's a kink, S&M. -Then you are in the wrong place. What's the right place? -Try Maggie's on Melrose. -All right, we'll let you know. You forget it, okay. Just stay out. You frighten 'em to death. I heard that place is supposed to be wild and out of our area. I think you boys are lost. -We need you to answer a few questions. -What can I do for you? We're looking into a murder. No way, man. They come in here to get into their fantasy. Ain't -no killing going on. -Do you know him? -The face is familiar. -Well why don't you put a name to it? I can't. I've only seen him in here once or twice. So help -me, man. I don't need your kind of trouble. -All right. Police Story will continue in a moment. -IAD. -Yeah, give me Sergeant Bivens. -This is Bivens. -It's Fontaine. Monty. Yeah, you -know that guy in the sketch? -Oh, you know who -he is now? -Yeah, well I saw him on the news. The -six o'clock news. -Who is he? Well, see, he had this special arrangement with Lily, -but I still got my cut. -Who is he? Cue it up. It's the new candidate for state assembly. -Yeah, well that's great. -Well. -Here's the guy, to the candidate's right. -Freeze it. -What's his name? -I don't know his name. -You rode with Stace. -I've never seen him before. Who is it? I just told you, I don't know his name. His name is John Mason. Intelligence says he's probably the most influential political power in the state. Central committee right -at the top. -You're gonna see him in the cabinet -when the next governor gets in. -You just gave me -a bomb, you know that? -Well, we figure that's what you're -getting paid for, Chief. -You can put him in the room with Lily? The CII says he owns a '38, bought it last year. -What does do for you? -Well, maybe plenty if he's got the blanks to go with the gun. Can you get a search warrant for the gun? -It's already in the works. -You can't prove he was looking to cover up his kinky sex acts to save a political career. If we get the piece, we don't need to, Chief. All right. I want one more candle on the cake. Stake him. Stop it, you hear me. Do you hear me, that's it. The next time someone looks at me so much as sideways, I'm coming after you and I'm in here for murder, comprende? Alright, I've had with you and Rafferty. You just bought yourself a beat, pal, a little time in a hole. Now do I need the cuffs? -Nope. -All right, move it. Otus, grab Rafferty. -You better plan better next time. -There ain't no -next time. -Did he scare you away, or you got some -love for a cop? -He took everything we threw at him and he gave it right back, but he never opened his mouth. He was a cop. -He's a con now. -Let's move it, Rafferty. -The paddies are gonna drop it. -We'll pick it up. We're hitting while he's in the hole. That way the bulls will figure -Rafferty finally got the job done. -But he's away -from the population. We can't get to him now. -Unless some of our people are in there with him. Leads kind of a dull life, doesn't he? Come on, tear his head off. Yeah! All right, break it up, break it up. You know where you're goin'. -Let's go, move. -Have a good time. Looks like we're starting to cook. you're pretty smart, Stacy. You just might make it in here. I made it on the outside, I'm gonna make it in here. You know why you scared us so bad on the streets? -I wasn't like those other cops. -No, you weren't. You were like us. You were one bad bull. Now in my book you're one bad con too. 15 minute stretch. -The hole. I thought it'd be a dungeon. -It used to be tough. Now we got all kinds of goodies, TVs, whatever you got. You might lose a few -privileges in here, but it ain't nothin'. -That's an oldie, I think I saw it before. That's where the cowboy with the white hat kisses -his horse instead of the woman. -You know what? We got a few minutes before chow. I was just gonna catch some z's. I can do that in your house. You can come in here on a bunk, kick back -and watch TV if you want. -Thanks, Rafferty. Know what? It would scare the hell out of me if I thought I could be as good a cop as I am a hard-timer. Three king three, stand by with your search warrants. Everything is a go on the other end. They're at Mason's apartment now. They got the gun and bullets. -All right. -Is Mason still inside? -Just went in. -I guess everybody's got their -thing, huh? -Yeah. That creep would kill to keep it a -secret. -Now let's do it. Police officers, open up. Hey, turn around, Mason. Get over here. -Please, please, this is embarrassing. -Save it, this is not a vice bust. This is for murder, pal. -Come on, we served a warrant on your apartment today. We got your gun, and Monte Fontaine's testimony about you a certain friend...Lily. Let's go. He's in number three. TV CHARACTER #2: Now what they mean is, how much are you paying? TV CHARACTER #3: I don't care how much they're paying, don't you go -spend it all on fancy shirts in Jackson City. -TV CHARACTER #2: Now you -run along, Spal. This is man business. -Hey, guard. Library coming through. Get him a doctor. -Thanks, guys. Thanks for everything. -It never should -have happened, Stace. That's for sure. -Well, it's over now. The chief's waiting to put you back in the beat. I think I'll just take my retirement. Things changed. A lot of things changed. Some ways, I'm too much like them to ever wear a badge. But I was one hell of a cop. -Where to? -To see my daughter and my grandkid. Next on Police Story. Look how many crazies there are out there. Better watch out for them, Joe. Get away from me, she's dead. 42 years, for god's sake, haven't you had enough? Look, man, I know your badge number. And I know your number too. Get your white paws off me then. -Tom, they're making your life hell. -You're the one who's doing that to me
