BELLS RING TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS Hello, Nick. Hello. Looking for someone? Yeah. On the 2:30? Yeah. Well, there she is. You Mr Dunnigan? Yes. I'm Nick Orloff. How do you do? Better unload. Hurry up there. We haven't got all day. Uh, are you the husband of the deceased back there? No, I'm just a friend. I see. Quite a surprise when I got your telegram from Hollywood. Yes, sir. Never had a client from Hollywood before. Hmm. Thought I knew every family in Coaltown. Treskovna. No. Never heard of them. No. No family in Coaltown by that name - Treskovna - willing to bet you. Olga Treskovna was her professional name. I see. She was an actress. You don't say. Used to live in Coaltown, huh? What's her, uh, real name? Olga Truckee. What? You mean Stan Truckee's kid? He was a coal miner. Stan Truckee was no miner. He was a lush. I gave him a first-class $100 funeral. His kid, Olga, arranged for it in person. Deadbeats, both of them. Never paid me. BRAKES SQUEAL Why are you stopping? It's four years since I buried her drunken pa for nothing. I ain't burying any more deadbeats until they pay up. You mean right now? I've waited four years. It was a $90 funeral, not $100. She told me. She paid you 10. That leaves 80. Give me $20. Oh, no. What about the extras - the flowers for the grave and pallbearers out of my own pocket? I'm a respectable businessman. I never cheated nobody. When I say 100 bucks, it's 100 bucks. My mistake, Mr Orloff... not noticing your fine qualities. People think dying is cheap, but it costs more to be buried than to be born. Yes, sir. When you figure all the incidentals... Shut up. I was only saying... You've said enough. THINKS: You'll be home soon, kid. Why anyone would want to come back to this flea-bitten end of the world, I don't know, but that's what you wanted, so you're here. That's all I can do for you - ride with you and tell you I love you. That's what's driving me crazy, that I waited till now to tell you, but I've got to say it now. I love you, baby. I love you. I guess I loved you the first time I saw your face. Show business is full of beautiful faces, and I'd seen them all, but I never saw one like yours, baby. Never like yours. RAGTIME MUSIC PLAYS 1...2... 3...4... Bend it! 1...2...3...slide! Travel! 1...2...3...slide! Travel! Hold it! Hold it! What are you trying to do to me? You - what's your name? Olga Treskovna. OK, Olga. The first rule of dancing - a girl has to stay on her feet! OK, get back in line. Try it again. Give them a pick-up, Freddy. MUSIC PLAYS Kick! Kick! Kick! 1...2...3...twist! Hold it! Hold it! Wait a minute. Look, we open in four days. So it's a burlesque show. They pay to see you, don't they? I'm not asking you to act. I'm not asking you to sing good, only loud. There's only one thing I ask you. Like a brother, I ask you. Give me this! This is all I want! Look. 1...2...3... pivot! OK, have you got it? Have you got it? All right, try it again. Give them a pick-up, Freddy. MUSIC PLAYS Same place. Kick, kick! Kick, kick! 1...2...3...head... Oh, wait a minute. You're breaking my heart. I haven't time for beginners. Step out of the line. Come back when you've learned something. Mr Elmo, please. No. We'll do it without you. Let me try again. I'll learn. I will. I'll stay after rehearsal. Please give me another chance. No can do. I haven't the time. Please. Go on, Tommy, give the kid a break. Who's that? Bill Dunnigan! How are you, Tommy? What are you doing, slumming? How are you, big boy? Saw you name outside, thought I'd buy you a drink. You buy me a drink? I owe you a million. The world's greatest press agent, meet the world's worst chorus. GIRLS: Hi, Bill. Hi, girls. OK, ladies, take a half-hour. Hiya, white spats. Freddy Evans. Nice to see you, Freddy. Tommy, do me a favour, will you? Sure. Just mention it. Let Freddy work with that new kid. He'll have her dancing like Pavlova. Oh, that kid's got two left feet. Come on. She's a nice girl. You know her, huh? No. I just like her face, and she needs the job. Give her a break. OK, if that's our pleasure. Freddy, take her and work with her. I'll be back in a half hour. You be able to show me that pivot, or else. I will. Thanks. And thank you so much, Mr... Dunnigan, you sap. Bill Dunnigan. Never mind the thanks. Just get that pivot. I will, Mr Dunnigan. Come on, big boy. It's like old times seeing you out front again. THINKS: That's where it began, and this is where it ends. You're home, Olga. Take that chair there, please. Hello, Eddie? This is Mr Orloff. I'm back from Nanticoke. Anybody been trying to get me? You don't have to use that tone of voice. Mr Dunnigan, I was stung once on the Truckees. I won't get stung again. No hard feelings, I hope. No hard feelings. Just honest business. That's right. OK, the job will cost you 150 bucks. 150? That includes transportation from the train to Coaltown. Of course, that ain't including pallbearers, in case you want them. You don't have to have them. I want them. Then you'll need six. That's $2.00 apiece. Could you get some of her father's friends or some people who knew her? You mean free? No chance. Stan Truckee was a sweet guy. I'm sure he must've had some friends. You think I'm trying to shake you down, huh? All right, I'll introduce you to some of his friends. Come on. You'll see if you can get them free. Come on. You'll see. BOISTEROUS CONVERSATION Hey, pipe down, will you? I want to ask you a question in front of this gentleman. I want to ask you if any of you remember Stan Truckee. Stan Truckee? Yeah. I knew him. What about Stan Truckee? His kid died. We're burying her alongside her old man. Would any of you like to act as pallbearers, on account of you knew Stan? Don't try to put nothing over on us, Nicky. We'll be pallbearers for 2 bucks apiece. Count me in at 2 bucks too! Me, too. Who's that guy? A friend of the deceased. OK, gents, I'll use the first six. Now I want four guys to carry her inside. Give me the stick, Billy. You guys better be good now. There's competition. Put it down on the floor. Now put your names down there for pallbearers. We don't want no arguments afterwards. I give you the bill before the hearse pulls out, and I get paid before the funeral. You said that. I just want it understood. It's understood! Send in two more. The first thing is to fix it up with Father Spinsky. His church is the big one on Spring Street. I'll arrange everything and you won't have no bother whatsoever. Now, make yourself comfortable. I'll be back in a few minutes. THINKS: I'll try to remember that you loved these people, baby, but it's hard figuring out why. What a sap I was, walking out of that theatre and not seeing you again for a whole year. Yes, a whole year before I ran into you again. I'll never forget that town. I wasn't thinking of you that night. I wasn't thinking about much of anything except what a cold and lonely place 'a small town can be on Christmas Eve... and wondering how to kill time till I could get the next train out... for my next stop. Is Miss Treskovna still in the theatre? Yeah. She's number one, right over there. Great. Thanks. Come in. Merry Christmas. Oh. Mr Dunnigan. Well, that's a pretty good memory. Katie - Miss Hallwin, this is Mr Dunnigan. How do you do? Pleased to meet you. I saw your picture in the lobby. Success, huh? This is the most exciting thing that could have happened. I wanted to thank you so. I've never forgotten how kind you were. "Give the kid a break." And disappearing like Santa Claus. If it hadn't been for you, I'd never have become Smokey Sue, the terror of the Ozarks. She's good, huh? Oh, she's in there hollerin'. Show business? I'm the advance man for the Up In The Moon company. I'm glad you've got a date tonight, kid. See you in the morning on the train. Merry Christmas. BOTH: Merry Christmas. Well, if you've got a date, I'll blow along. I just wanted to say hello. I haven't any date. You're not going somewhere? Just to the hotel, pretend it's a real Christmas Eve. I suppose you're with friends. I won't keep you, Mr Dunnigan. The name is Bill, and I'm your date tonight. Go and get your coat on. You hungry? Yes. Wonderful. Must be some place in this town that's open, besides the county jail. THINKS: There will never be a walk again like the one that night. Yelling in the snow and laughing. You telling me to listen to the reindeer bells. I felt as though I were drunk, but I didn't know what it was. I didn't know I'd feel the same way every time I was with you. This way, please. How nice. Yes. Here you are close to the snow and to a radiator. Are you Ming Gow? Yes. My name's Bill. This is Olga. I hope we're not a nuisance coming in. I'm happy to have you. Not much trade on Christmas Eve. No. Everybody is home. But show people. And Ming Gow. No, no. Please. Will the lady and gentleman allow me to prepare dinner? Thank you. In Iowa, we run into a Chinese Santa Claus. It's a wonderful night. First, bird's nest soup with lotus seed floating in it, then fing han, which is lobster fixed in the Cantonese manner. Oh. Then a dish of gaiset gai and some gai-lan soon, which is only broccoli with a Chinese accent. Then hop tan yei - chicken and walnuts. Hold it, Ming. That'll be enough. Please. There will be more. Bill, let him. You're so nice, Ming Gow. We're so lucky to meet you tonight. We were walking through the snow, hoping to find some ham and eggs. And the weary travellers came upon a castle in the snow, presided over by a magician named Ming Gow, who set before them pomegranates and guinea hen from Zanzibar. Give us the works. Let's have a feast to remember. You shall have a feast that you shall always remember. Ahh. Ming, tremendous. Calls for a cigar. I'll bring it. No, I'll get it. SHE COUGHS Thank you. How about some music, Olga? Oh, I'd love it. MUSIC: Silent Night I always liked those tunes on Christmas Eve. Used to hear them when I was a kid. How are you, baby? Fine, Bill. Good. A toast from that eminent philosopher Ming Gow is in order. The floor is yours, Ming. A long time ago, three wise men followed a star, found a child in a cradle. We also are all from far away. Tonight, we were brought together by someone who makes the snow fall. I drink to what we shall find. How nice. You don't think it was an accident, my running into Olga again? No. These things are all written. We follow the script, huh? Yes. We follow. Maybe you tell me something. What would you like to know, Ming Gow? Your name. Olga Truckee, alias Olga Treskovna. Truckee, huh? Do you mind telling me a little? No. When did you first decide to be an actress? When I was a little girl, I think. Where was that? I was born in Poland. When I was quite young, we came to America to a place in Pennsylvania called... ..Coaltown. Little Poland. Near Wilkes-Barre? Yes. Coaltown killed my mother. And then four years ago, my father died. Coaltown killed him, too. But my father was very sweet and kind. He played the accordion and sang, and he used to say to me when he had a hangover... which was...very often... .."Go away someplace, Olga, and sing. "Dance, act, and sing. "Try to be happy. "That will make other people happy, too." He taught me all the songs he knew. Polish songs. Sad ones, happy ones, all kinds. Sing one for us - a happy one. Oh, no. Yes. Please do. SHE SINGS IN POLISH That's good. Just a little song. Everybody in Coaltown knows it. It's about coming home when you've been away for a long time. Now you're going to be a star. Yes. I keep studying between shows and on the trains. I'll be ready when my chance comes. You know our show's headed west? That's where Hollywood is. According to last reports. I'm going to make good there. I must. Not so fast. You've just started. You need a couple years in stock playing the old plays. You've got a lot to learn. I haven't time for that, Bill. I want to get there quickly. When I am a big star in my own dressing room and all the interviewers ask me, "How did this success come to you, Olga?" I'll tell them it came from... ..Bill Dunnigan, who once said, "Give the kid a break." And I'll be right there taking a bow, too. But a year in stock is what you need. You're only 20. There are two kinds of people who don't have enough time - the very old... ..and the very young. I think we'd better go. It's late, and we have to catch early trains. Look. It stopped snowing. I'll bet you the whole town's asleep except us. Well, let's have the check, Ming. No check. Oh, come on. We ate the whole restaurant. No check, please. On Christmas, people exchange gifts. Let this humble meal be my gift to the other two wise guests from far away. OK. Admit Ming Gow and party. There you are, Ming, for Up In The Moon any night you want to go. Just ask for Fred Cooper. Thank you. Oh, here it is. It's nothing very much, just a little medal. It's dedicated to St Michael, the archangel. He's my favourite saint. Will you take it, please? Thank you. St Michael? What's his speciality? Fighting...for God. He is a very gallant saint, Bill. I will carry this and hope for that great success. Goodnight, Ming Gow. And Merry Christmas, Ming Gow. Yes. Merry Christmas, Ming. Merry Christmas to you. Huh? Which way? The Iowa Hotel. Oh, around the corner. I'm at the Dexter. What time are you pulling out? 6:30. Are you going the other way? Yeah. I go east - at 5:30. It's a mill train, but it's the only connection. What is it? Look. The stars. Yes. There are a lot of them. One of them's mine. Oh? Which one? Do you see over there, where the V-shaped cluster is? Yeah. Just to the right of it. The bright one. Oh, yeah. I see it. It's yours. Yes. My father told me it appeared in the sky for the first time the night I was born. Could be. It's there to remind me every night of where I'm going. Oh, I am being very silly. I won't see you again for a long time, maybe. Will you accept a Christmas present from a strange young lady? My star up there. I'll give you half of it. THINKS: Why didn't I say something? But no, not a word. Not even, where can I write you? What's your route sheet? I want to see you again. Just old clam-mouth walking along with his heart jumping and never a word. I got to start thinking, kid. It can't end like this. It can't end with Dunnigan the dummy staring at a box. Didn't keep you waiting too long, I hope. You got everything fixed? Yes, sirree, I had a big talk with Father Spinsky. We worked everything out fine. He's going to give you a solemn Requiem Mass. I got hold of a singer from Wilkes-Barre. She happened to be in town. Let's see, that'll be 30 bucks extra. I figured a blanket of roses for the coffin, then I figured a wreath as a personal tribute from yourself. Altogether, the floral tributes will amount to 80 bucks. We mustn't forget the charge for the sexton of the church. Almost forgot that. You wouldn't want to forget any charges. I'll have to figure out a donation for Father Spinsky's church. Personally, I think 75 bucks will do it. Not too much and not too little, which brings the total up to 350. 350? That's a lot more than... That ain't much for a service at St Leo's. St Leo's? Is that where you made the arrangements? Yes, sir. The biggest church in town. But that's the wrong church. I wanted them made at St Michael's. Oh, no, no. You don't want St Michael's. You don't want your friend buried from there. It a broken-down old church. Nobody worthwhile goes there. Father Spinsky's church is the only place. Mr Orloff, where is St Michael's? All right. I ain't worried. You ain't going to do business with Father Paul. He ain't got nothing to offer you. You'll be back. It's down at the end of the street, right across from the hotel. Thanks. Remember, Father Paul can't do nothing for you. He's got no connections in town, just miners. DOORBELL RINGS Come in. Are you Father Paul? Yes. My name's Bill Dunnigan. How do you do? I brought a friend of mine back to Coaltown - a girl. She wanted to be buried from your church. From St Michael's? Yes. She has a plot in your cemetery. It's already been paid for in full. What I want to do now is arrange for a church funeral. How much do you charge? Please sit down, Mr Dunnigan. Her Father was buried from your place five years ago. His name was Stan Truckee. That bill's unpaid. I'll take care of that up to any reasonable amount. I wasn't here five years ago. Did you bring this girl from somewhere out of town? From Hollywood. Hollywood? That's where they make the movies. Yes, I know. Hollywood to St Michael's. That's rather strange. I understand there are certain charges, fees and so forth. If you'd give an estimate... Maybe I'd better tell you first. She wanted a few...extras. She wanted organ music, and she also wanted... ..six angels with wings to stand beside the coffin. The angels will be little girls. That's an old Polish custom. How much for the girls with wings and the organist? The children will be happy to serve without any fee. Sometimes our organist receives $3.00, but this is a poor parish. She's used to not being paid. Oh. How much for you? For me? I, too, am used to not being paid, and I'd rather not break the precedent. I am very proud that this girl wanted to be buried from my church. To a humble priest, that's a great satisfaction, and it is fee enough. Please, put that away, Mr Dunnigan. I'm sorry, Father. I came in here like a sorehead. It was just that... Well, it's a pleasure to run into a human being in Coaltown or anywhere. I was beginning to think the world had run out of them. Look, Father, I might as well lay it on the line. Ever hear of poverty? Yes, an old friend of St Michael's. I'm down to $300 and with no visible means of support at the moment. I've made millions for people I've worked for. A press agent can do that. I never got around to making myself rich. I never wanted to be a millionaire. I just wanted to live like one. That'll keep you poor, you know. Father, I hate the thought of her being in Orloff's place. That's a little rough even on a brave kid like Olga. Could we have her brought here to your church? Certainly. She belongs here. She'll like that. I mean, she would've liked that. That's the whole trouble with this trip, all these arrangements about the funeral. To me she isn't dead. It's as if she were here and we were doing all this together. Oh, I don't mean that I see her or anything like that. I mean... I know what you mean. Hello? Hello, this is Father Paul. Hello, Hattie. Would you get me Nick Orloff? Yes. Thank you. Telephoning in Coaltown is sort of different. Mr Orloff, this is Father Paul speaking. Yes. Yes, I know. He's - he's here now. I've called to tell you to bring the body of Stan Truckee's daughter to St Michael's immediately. Not tomorrow, Mr Orloff. Immediately. Now. Right away. You're a greedy and stupid man, Mr Orloff. No, I'm not afraid of you and all your friends. Bring the girl here immediately without any further discussion. Goodbye. You can be tough when you have to. You didn't look it. My adviser, Michael the archangel. Oh, yes. I've heard of him. He had to be, as you say, tough. Mr Orloff will be here in half an hour. Thank you, Father. I'm probably taking up your time. I'll wait in the church. No, please. Wait here. Talk to me about Olga. I can see you loved her very much. You can, huh? Are you sure I won't bore you? No. Come, Mr Dunnigan. I'd like to hear what's in your heart. I only met Olga twice before I took a job on the coast. I'd become tired of hopping around peddling a road company to a lot of antitheatrical towns, so I figured on settling down in the lotus land of Hollywood. And I get me a job as personal drumbeater for the great Marcus Harris. Marcus Harris? You've never heard of him? Well, Marcus Harris is one of the greatest motion picture producers in America, who at the moment was giving birth to his greatest production, a $3 million epic called Joan Of Arc. Now, gentlemen, I want this trouble with Anna Klovna settled. I don't want to have a fight going on. Hard enough to make pictures without fights. It's Miss Klovna who's doing all the fighting. Where's Dunnigan? I sent for Dunnigan. Why isn't he here, Miss Mulhauser? OVER INTERCOM: He's on his way, Mr Harris. Thank you very much. I sent for you an hour ago. Well, here I am, chief. Whenever he's late, I get promoted to chief. Bill, we're in trouble. Yeah, I heard rumours. Uh, Miss Klovna is playing nasty again. Let's not call anybody any names. I've got a million dollars invested in Miss Klovna, so I would like to think she isn't nasty, just a little nervous. I'm assigning you the job of handling Miss Klovna. Thanks very much, but I don't think that'll solve any problems. I'm asking this as a favour. Two days after she landed in this country, you got her the keys to the city of New York, arranged a parade in her honour, kept her picture in the papers for 55 days. Have another. She'll listen to you and nobody else. I don't know, Marcus. Fame is very bad for some people. It goes to their heads. Come on, gentlemen, we'll go with Mr Dunnigan and give him all the help we can. With all the respect in the world, Miss Klovna... Respect? That is what you do not give me. I have played Joan in Europe. Shaw's Joan. Schiller's Joan. What have I to learn from you? That was the stage. This is the movies. Hello, Anna. What's all the fireworks? Oh, Mr Dunnigan! This imbecile is trying to tell me how to act Joan. Me! He wants me to get here before I'm awake - to rehearse. He needs rehearsal, not me. Relax. Be yourself. You're a great artist. Don't act like a two-year-old. Then I want to be treated like a great artist. And if I am a little late, I don't want to be screamed at like a servant girl. A little late? Two hours late every morning this week! A full crew and 300 extras, standing around waiting for her nibs. They are waiting, eh? Who cares? Come on, Anna, let's talk it over in your dressing room. He tells me it costs Mr Marcus Harris $10,000 because I'm late. Let it cost him! What do I care how much money it costs that stupid upstart? The only education he has is vending from a pushcart. No ignorant peasant can give orders to Anna Klovna. We don't talk like that in America. No. All you talk in America is money, money, money! What do you know about art in America, you and your Marcus Harris? Oh, I spit on you both. I'm finished! I quit! I go back to the theatre! No more here! No more! You ought to have some sense knocked into you. Enough, Mr Dunnigan. I'll talk to Miss Klovna. You can't make me do anything, you and all your money. I don't want you to do anything. You can quit. I'm sorry you don't like me, Miss Klovna, but that's all right. I'm sorry you don't like America. That isn't all right. So many people from your country have learned to love America. It's too bad you couldn't see something nice in such a wonderful place. We'll pay Miss Klovna off in full and shelve the picture. Send out a notice that Anna Klovna's had a...nervous breakdown and won't be able to finish the picture. Oh! Oh! Well, you surely called her bluff, Marcus. She'll be back in half an hour ready to play marbles. I don't want her back. I like this country. I won't work with anyone who doesn't like it. We'll get somebody else. Klovna isn't the only actress in the world. There's nobody else available who can play Joan of Arc, at least nobody who's available for some time. Not a very nice woman, Miss Klovna, but she's a great talent. She was made for the part of Joan. Well, that's too bad. I'm shelving the picture. I'll see you in my office, Mr Dolan. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry this has happened. Maybe next time we'll have better luck. Thank you. Wrap it up, boys! Mr Dunnigan! Mr Dunnigan! Bill! Holy Ike! Am I dreaming? Hello, Bill. Olga, look at you. Don't tell me you're in pictures. I was. I lost my job. I was a stand-in for Anna Klovna. No! No more Anna Klovna, no more job, at least for the moment. I didn't know you were working for Mr Harris. Sure. I nearly fell over when I saw you. Let's get out of here. Pardon me. So you're a stand-in, huh? Not much of a job for a foolish young lady who dreamed of being a star. You quit dreaming, huh? No, I haven't. Only it's taking longer than I thought. You know, it makes me happy just to look at you. I've got to go hold Marcus' hand for a while. Where would you like to go for dinner? Bill, let me cook dinner for you. I've got a sort of apartment with a stove, and I've been dying to have a guest. No guests? No. I'm glad. What's the address? 1461 Curson Avenue. It's over a garage. 1461. I'll be there. I have to go home and change. Will it be all right if I get there about 7:00? I'll see you later. More coffee? Oh, no, thanks. Won't you finish the pie? I couldn't handle it. I've had three big pieces and two pounds of goulash. Have a heart, will you? You know, it's a very cute layout. Restful. I was lucky to get it. Come furnished? Oh, yes. I painted the floor myself. Oh? Oh. I think it's just as good as a carpet. Oh, sure. Better. Thanks. HE SIGHS Well, baby, now tell me the rest of it. There isn't any rest of it. I kept going round and round the studios, and sometimes they said, "Come back," and sometimes they said, "Don't come back." But whatever they said, it always ended the same way - no job for a new young movie star. So I tried to get an agent because the girls I met all told me, "Olga, you cannot become a star without an agent." So I started going round and round the agencies. I sang for them, I acted for them, I even danced for them... ..and ended up without an agent. Imagine. Olga Treskovna without an agent. Bill, you are not listening. I'm listening, baby. I'm listening to a lot of things. What's the matter, Bill, did the pie upset you? No, no, no, I'm just thinking. Can you act? Who, me? Who else would I mean? You know I can act. How do I know? I told you. Oh, yeah. So you did. I'm much better now. I spend all my spare time reading plays, learning parts. Juliet and Meg Wiley. Elizabeth Barrett. You're better-looking than she is. Who? Anna Klovna. You're younger, prettier. You got more heart. Bill, what are you talking about? Take it easy, baby. I'm incubating. Bill, you don't mean Joan Of Arc? Never mind what I mean. Let me see you act. Mr Harris would never hire a stand-in for a star. Never mind and his whims. Bill. Don't argue. Do you know any scenes from the script? Bill, I know the whole script. Look, I don't want the whole script, I just want one scene, one big scene. When? Right now. We've got to move quick. It's one of those things. All right. You ready? Yes. OK, now, come on. The camera's rolling. You're on. Action! It's the scene when she comes into the courtroom in the castle of Rouen for the first time. They've brought her up from the dungeon... ..and she walks down the hallway with her chains hanging from her. Then the doors of the courtroom open. She sees all the great English aristocrats and all the great philosophers and doctors of theology. They sit in a circle above her, all those stone faces. They're here in the courtroom to make her confess she is a liar and a blasphemer and that the voices she has listened to come from the devil and not from God, because if they can make her say that, then her name would be fouled and ruined. The French have only one weapon left - the name of Joan of Arc and the belief that God is helping them through her. Cauchon, the bishop in charge of the trial, speaks. Do you consider yourself in a state of grace? If I am not, I hope God will put me there. And if I am, I hope he'll keep me there. We want you to speak the truth. Truth is a sacred gift from God. Do you believe that? Yes... ..but people have been hanged for speaking it. Why did Satan first command you to slay the English? The voices of my saints commanded me to fight for France. You went into battle. I led the battle! You were present when English blood was shed! Yes! And what were the English doing on the soil of France? Why didn't they keep their blood at home where French swords couldn't spill it? No... ..whatever you do to me... ..I will not say what isn't true. And the truth is... ..I am a peasant girl, and I love my mother and father and my brothers. And I would have stayed in Domremy and cooked and sewed and tended the sheep... but God spoke to me, through his angel Michael, and he told me to go out into the world and help my people. I went... ..and I fought... ..and if I escape from here, I will continue to fight for them. And if I do not escape and you burn me for what I've done... ..I will kneel in the fire and give God my thanks for his kindness to me and my people. OK. OK, baby, sit down. Where's the phone? Oh. Was it all right? Yeah, yeah. Hello. Mr Harris, please. Bill Dunnigan calling. Yes, will you, please? Bill. Shh. Hello, Marcus. Bill Dunnigan. I've got some very important news. Hang on to your hat. All right. Hang on to your pyjamas, then. You don't have to shelve the picture. Just keep listening, will you? I found another Anna Klovna, plus. Would I call you up if I were kidding? She's young, beautiful, completely unknown. Can she act? Can Heifetz fiddle? Can Joe Louis fight? I'm telling you, this is it. I want her tested first thing in the morning. Give me your OK and I'll set everything up. Sure, sure. I've got her all tied up. Nobody'll get to her before you see the test. I give you my solemn word of honour. I'll see you tomorrow. Goodnight. Bill. Relax, baby. I'm going to explode. You're going to bed. It's like the time I heard you in the dark saying, "Give the kid a break." I don't know why I deserve anybody like you. I've got to talk Dolan into making the test. We don't want it made by some stooge. And you're going to bed right now and sleep. You didn't tell him who I really am. We'll come to that jump tomorrow. Bill, how can I ever repay you? By knocking 'em dead, baby. Tomorrow's the big day. Not as big as now. Oh, Bill. Thanks. No, they don't have to worry which side to photograph. They're both perfect. And those eyes. All right, baby, I want you fresh when you play that big scene for the camera tomorrow. Goodnight. Goodnight. Now, don't worry about anything. I'll take care of wardrobe and notify make-up. See you on the barricades at dawn, baby. Somebody's crazy. It isn't I, it's you. You're the craziest man I've had here. Will you listen to me? I'm listening and hearing a lunatic. How can you ask me to spend $3 million on somebody called Olga Trestoogy... Treskovna. A stand-in, a girl who's never acted, a burlesque girl. Joan of Arc. No, wait a minute, Marcus. Hold it! You're a nice guy. I don't want to get sore. He doesn't want to get sore. You don't have to test Olga Treskovna. You don't have to hire her, but you're going to know this. She's better than any star you ever wanted. Not only her acting, it's what's inside her. What shines out of her. It's something you don't see in the world often. Don't test it, don't buy it, but take your hat off to it. INTERCOM BUZZES What is it? OVER INTERCOM: Miss Olga Treskovna is here. Tell her to come in. Olga Treskovna, Mr Marcus Harris. How do you do, Mr Harris? I always wanted to come through that door and stand here in a lovely costume and say, "How do you do, Mr Harris?" Mr Dolan, you will please make a test of Miss Treskovna for the leading part in our picture. And good luck. Thank you. Well, the test was great. We started shooting three days later, and she was even better. We were all set and away. She had a special dressing room, special studio car, and everybody raving about her. No gags. Real raves. I'll tell you, Father, you've never seen a dream come true like this one. Sounds wonderful. DOORBELL RINGS I think that's Mr Orloff. Come in, please. Where do you want the box? Would you carry it into the church? I got it uncrated for you. Yes, you may keep the lumber, Mr Orloff. That don't pay me. There's an extra charge - 5 bucks. There you are. Now beat it. You're going to hear from Father Spinsky. Yes, sir. I hope this isn't causing you any trouble, Father. Oh, no. Father Spinsky is a man of God with a rather expensive church to keep up, and I'm sure he'll understand the situation when I explain it. It's time for the evening services. Would you care to come with me? In church? Oh, I don't know, Father. Please, come and see her there. I wouldn't worry about Mr Orloff's revenge, Mr Dunnigan. There isn't anything that anyone can do to St Michael's that the wind, rain, and coal dust haven't already done. Not much of a house. We're fixing the leaks in the roof. Oh, I didn't mean that. I mean nobody out front. You know, attending. Is this an off night? No. We hardly ever have more than a dozen or so. The men are tired when they come out of the mines. And the women... The women also work very hard here in Coaltown. It seems they're almost too tired to come to God. Those statues look rather lonely, don't they? Say, isn't that our boy up there? Yes, St Michael the archangel. I thought so. It's a shame, a house like this. I think your church needs a press agent, Father. God doesn't need a press agent. I'm not so sure. Once upon a time, he had 12 very good press agents. Top men. My, I never thought of the apostles as press agents. What else were they? They sold the biggest story that ever happened to a whole world - and without the benefit of newspapers and radio. Terrific job. Oh, yes, terrific job. You'll stay for the services? Oh, I don't think so, Father. I guess I haven't been inside a church since my mother stopped taking me. She died when I was seven. She was a Protestant. You won't change your mind and stay, as a Protestant? No. I'll drop in some other time. I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah. Goodnight, kid. Olga used to talk to me about these hills. "Mountains covered with flowers", she called them. Coaltown doesn't look so bad from here. The coal dust doesn't blow up here. The flowers are always clean. If I had to live down there, I think I'd welcome coming up here for a good long sleep. Perhaps most of them do. SINGING IN POLISH Good morning. Good morning, Father. HE HUMS THE POLISH SONG You know that song? Yes. Olga sang it for me once. She said it was about coming home after you've been away for a long time. Yes. It's a sort of a Polish "Home, Sweet Home". It has an English translation, too. # Ever homeward # Ever homeward # Yearns the weary rover # Ever homeward # Ever homeward # Till the journey's over # Warm embraces, friendly faces # Sing welcome home # Let me lie there # 'Neath the sky there # Nevermore to roam # Ever homeward # Ever homeward # Yearns the weary rover # Ever homeward # Ever homeward # Now the journey's over. # Thank you, Father. That song makes Coaltown seem different somehow. When you're up here, you can understand Coaltown. You realise that the sins of the poor are mostly in their poverty, not in themselves. My own small troubles seem very unimportant, my failures insignificant. Your failures, Father? Oh, yes. When I was ordained, I came here filled with the zeal and confidence of a crusader. St Michael and I would form a partnership and make over Coaltown, but I had forgotten that the first lesson a young student learns in a seminary is humility. Tell me more about Olga. I asked a friend if she had heard of Olga Treskovna, the movie actress. She said she hadn't. I told her she was very famous. They wouldn't let her become famous. But you said she was very successful. No, not that way. She was great, but no-one will ever know it. A new star, but no-one will ever see her. Well, what happened, Mr Dunnigan? You don't know Hollywood, do you, Father? Only from what I've seen in pictures. I'll tell you. Maybe I'll get an idea if I talk. You got time? Oh, yes. Well, Marcus tripled her take after two weeks of shooting. That's how good she was. Tore up her contract. But she never changed. It's quite a thing to jump from nowhere into stardom. One day nobody's talking to you, the next day there's a world at your feet. She was hounded by reporters, interviewers, columnists. Helped along by me, of course. She was a natural for publicity. A real Cinderella story. And all the time she was getting thinner and more tired, but she'd been working very hard, and I thought it was just that. I was too blind to even suspect anything more serious until one day in her dressing room... See you soon. Bye-bye. Help me out of this. It weighs a tonne. Oh, what a day. What a lovely, lovely day. I've never worked so hard in all my life. Dolan's a regular slave-driver, but I love him for it. Oh, I feel as light as air. Does she have a temperature? She's awfully hot. You would be, too, under those lights with all this armour on. Let's have a wonderful party, Bill, when the picture's over. Yeah, we'll do that. SHE BREATHES HEAVILY Poor serious Bill. He is so terribly serious. He doesn't know how gay life can be, how wonderful it... SHE COUGHS Get me that bottle, Mr Dunnigan. Here, dear. Take this. It's just some cough medicine Dr Jennings has given me. Dr Jennings? I've been using my voice so much lately - all those long speeches - 10, 11 takes. By the way, Miss Olga, the doctor's office phoned. He wants you to come in after work. He'll wait for you. Yes, I'll go. I told him you would. Just think, Bill - three more days, and the picture will be finished. As soon as it's finished, you're going down to Palm Springs for a rest. I'll arrange for a bungalow. That would be wonderful, Bill. You look so tired, you frighten me. I don't see patients without appointments, but my nurse tells me this is an emergency. Maybe it is. Doctor, I want to know what's wrong with Olga Treskovna. I don't discuss my patients with strangers. I'm not a stranger. Is your name Dunnigan? Yeah. How did you know? I asked her as a matter of routine her next of kin. She filled in the name of William Dunnigan. How sick is she, Doctor? She's a very sick girl, Mr Dunnigan. She has been for a long time. Coal dust weakened her lungs as a child. We call that anthracosis. It isn't always serious if we get it in time. I see. But Olga has developed tuberculosis. Her X-rays are pretty bad. She needs what we call surgical rest. She should have had this supervised rest a long time ago. If we could send her to a sanitarium... I tried to persuade her to, but something seems to be driving her. She's determined to finish this picture, even if it kills her. Yeah, I know. But she will get well? If it's not too late. Perhaps you and I, working together, can save her. There's always a chance. No more than that, huh? Well... Thanks for telling me, Doctor. Goodbye. Goodbye. OLGA: Do you see over there where that V-shaped cluster is? Just to the right of it. The bright one. It's there to remind me every night of where I'm going. How is she? All right, I guess. Everybody ready? Ready. Start your background action. Camera ready? Ready. Take it up. Background, action! All right, roll it! Action! CROWD SHOUT All right, cut! That's it! Olga, I'm going to tell Dolan you're not going to work any more today. No. No, Bill. Please. Why? Because you're all in, that's why. There's just one more shot, then it's finished, the whole picture. Yeah, but look, baby, it doesn't have to be finished today. Marcus said we can pick up this last shot tomorrow or next week. Oh, please, Bill. This is important to me. Please. We're ready, Miss Treskovna. Coming. Come along, Bill. Here I am, Mike. Oh. How are you? Are you ready for the big scene? Yes. It's the last shot. Can you go through to the finish? Yes. OK. You're the best there is. Get up there and give it all you've got. All right, put the chains on her, boys. Is the fire ready? Yes, sir. OK, let's turn them over. Action! All you who are here... ..I pardon you for what you do. I am young, and I do not know much of life, but I know that this little place in which I stand is not the world. There are places I've never seen where men and women are full of sweetness and hope. I speak to them out of the pain that comes. Dream on. Dream on of God and goodness. Believe in truth and justice, for the world is yours. I will not die. I will not die. When the fire burns me, my soul will remain to sing the glory of God. I will remain as a light, a light for those in the dark. My Jesus... ..bless him. All right, cut! APPLAUSE DUNNIGAN: It was an inspired performance. The crowd knew it, and I knew it, but it wasn't until the next day that I realised it was more than a performance because it wasn't Joan dying, it was Olga. She died the day after the picture was finished. I, uh... I've decided not to release Joan Of Arc. I'm going to shelve the picture and remake it when I can find the proper person to play the part again. You're going to shelve it? Marcus, you can't do that. Nobody else will ever give you a performance like that. Don't argue with me, Bill. I'm not going to release a picture with a dead girl in it, and that's final. You've got to release it, Marcus. Olga died to make it. She gave up her life to act in it, to make something beautiful. Where's your heart, Marcus? You're a great guy. Do it for her. I'm sorry, Bill. I can't. If Olga had been a girl whom the public had seen and known, learned to love, I might be willing to take a chance, but they've never seen her before. All they could be told would be that they can't see her again. We all gambled on an unknown and lost. We didn't know she was sick. Now I'm going to take my losses, and try again when I can recast the part with an established star. That's all, gentlemen. I'm sorry, Bill. She was a fine girl, but my going bankrupt isn't going to help her or you or me. What are you going to do, Bill? I'm taking her home. That's what she wanted. Take a rest for yourself. You don't look well. And then come back. I don't think so, Marcus. So long. It's tough, Bill, but...it'll pass. Everything does. I don't think so. It can't end like this. But that's the way it did end - picture shelved, Olga's talent and beauty stuck away in a vault... ..buried like we're going to bury her. It's kind of mean for a girl to have two funerals, one for her body and one for her soul. BELL RINGS HE PRAYS IN LATIN Church bells, aren't they, Father? Yes. What are they ringing for? Why, they ring every day at noon all over the world. I guess I never listened. They ring to remind us how the angel of the Lord came to Mary. Hey, I knew there was something I'd forgotten. It's been haunting me. Olga wanted your church bell rung at the funeral. That's the kind of sap I am. I almost forgot her last request. I'd like to arrange that, Father. Certainly. I'll tell the sexton. Is it expensive? I just don't want to short-change anybody. We usually give the sexton $5.00, and he rings the bell for 15 minutes. You've thought of something else? Yeah. Father, how many churches are there in Coaltown? Why, we have five churches. Do they all have bells? Well, yes. They have fine bells. Five churches with bells, huh? Mr Dunnigan, you're not thinking... I'm thinking of a lot of things. Yes, but you can't... Now, wait a minute, Father. This is pretty big. I've been sleeping. I've been walking around in a daze. Look, Father. Five churches, five bells. I want all the bells to ring at 8:00 tonight and keep on ringing for three days. But why? A brain cell moved finally. I was sitting around moaning like a beggar on a rainy day. It's going to cost money. What's going to cost money? Ringing the bells for three days and three nights. You'll have to hire men at so much per hour. That will be taken care of. But you told me you had no money. You've heard of St Michael. Yes, but I don't... He was a scrapper, wasn't he? Indeed. He was the first warrior of Heaven. He rescued Peter the Apostle from prison twice and fought and defeated Lucifer, Prince of Darkness. What are you worried about? He's on our side, isn't he? Sit down, Mr Dunnigan. Thank you. Father Spinsky, I have been visiting the churches of Coaltown. St Leo's being the largest and most important, I saved it for last. I've arranged to have their bells rung starting at 8:00 tonight, and I'd like to have St Leo's bell included. I'm doing this to satisfy the dying wish of someone dear to me. It's unusual for St Leo's bell to ring for a funeral in St Michael's. Oh, I appreciate that, Father, and I'm ready to pay for this unusual privilege. I want the bell rung for three days and three nights. Three days and three nights? Yes. The other pastors have agreed that $10 an hour would be satisfactory. This is St Leo's, Mr Dunnigan. We have much higher expenses than the other little churches. Oh, I can see that, Father. How much will it cost? I'm afraid St Leo's could not ring its bell for less than...$20 an hour. I can understand that. It must cost a lot to keep up this magnificent church. Now, that'll be a total of 72 hours at $20 an hour. That'd come to... ..$1,440. Is that right? I don't carry that much cash with me. I assume a check will be all right? If you haven't the cash... ..of course. I'm honoured St Leo's will be part of the... ..funeral services for Olga Treskovna. There you are. Thank you, sir. Then it's agreed. You'll start at 8:00 and ring continuously until the $1,440 are used up. Yes, Mr Dunnigan. You'll want a receipt? No, Father. The cancelled cheque will be my receipt. Thank you. You've been very kind. Good afternoon, Mr Dunnigan. Oh, could I see you? Just a minute. Where do you want to go? Nowhere. I want to send a telegram. It's very important. The taxi driver said you could handle it. Well, come on in. Oh, you come in yesterday on the eastbound - brought that body. I want this sent straight. Full rate, huh? That'll come to something. Let's see if I can read it. I'm in a hurry to get that off. Mister, if I can't read it, I can't send it. Let's see... "Marcus Harris, Excelsior Studios, Hollywood, Cal." That's California, huh? That's right. "Dear Marcus, have terrific stunt to save Joan Of Arc. "Ask no questions. Wire...$10,000... "immediately, care of Miners' Bank and Trust Company, Nanticoke, Pennsylvania..." That's just a block down... Yes, I know where it is. Uh... "Must have it by noon. "It will pay back $10 million... "..gross for picture. Doonigan is in great..." That's Dunnigan. "Dunnigan is in great form. "Trust Dunnigan completely. "Dunnigan is still world's greatest press agent. "Regards, Dunnigan." Who's Dunnigan? I am. You don't say? I counted. It comes to $4.08. There's 5.00. Keep the change and buy yourself a drink. Here's the number I want you to call in Coaltown. Call me when the answer comes through. That comes to $4.08. I paid you. Here's 5.00. $10,000. Nobody ever sent $10,000 to Nanticoke. I'll sure like to see that return wire. So will I. But just the two of us. That's why I didn't phone it in. Oh, yes, sir. Get that right off, will you? Yes, yes. This is something. HORN HONKS MAN HUMS Where do you want to go now? Back to Coaltown. Oh, I don't know if we can make it. HE HUMS Hey, Sleski, you think maybe I'd better drive? No, I can drive all right. CHURCH BELLS RING What's the matter? I must have had one too many. I keep hearing a church bell. Right on the dot - 8:00. You hear that? Yes, indeed. Beautiful. Sounds like all the churches in town. I never heard church bells ringing in Coaltown at this time of night. Hey, what's all the bells ringing for? Is somebody dead? Been going on since 8:00. Yeah, but they wouldn't all be ringing for somebody dead. Hiya, Bob. What's going on in them churches? Give me a beer, will you? They've been ringing for ten minutes. Some dope must be getting married. Guess again. They're ringing all over town. All I know is they started ringing about 20 minutes ago, and nobody's been able to tell me why yet. OK, I'll let you know. That was the Nanticoke Journal. Don't they know anything? No, they don't know anything, either. BELLS CONTINUE RINGING That's St Michael's. St Leo's is ringing, too. BELLS CONTINUE RINGING Uh, uh, Mr Dunnigan? Yeah? They're in there. Who's in there? Newspapermen. I stuck them in the parlour. Newspapermen, huh? Thanks. Mr Dunnigan? Yes. I'm Tod Jones from the Associated Press. Briggs. Wilkes-Barre Sun. Nanticoke - The Journal. Tanner's my name. Glad to see you, gentlemen. We got a call from Nanticoke about these bells. What's it all about? Father Paul at St Michael's told us to talk to you. This is surprising, all this interest. I didn't think anyone outside of Coaltown would notice the bells. Who is this Olga Trotki - uh, Treskovna? She died ten days ago in Hollywood. She was an actress there - a great actress, gentlemen. When she died, she wanted to be brought back here where she'd lived most of her life. She wanted to be buried beside her father. Stan Truckee was sort of a wandering minstrel. He played the accordion and sang. He was born with a gift of laughter and song. He passed these on to his daughter. She was a Hollywood star, eh? Was she in any movies we've heard of? I don't see any reason for going into that. Drink? Yeah. Fine. Mr Cummer. Yes? Will you bring a bottle of bourbon and some glasses, please? As I was saying, gentlemen, she'd just finished making Joan Of Arc for Marcus Harris. You're Bill Dunnigan, aren't you? "White spats" Dunnigan. I haven't worn spats in quite a while. Well, fellas, this is really good. You know who we're interviewing? Bill Dunnigan, the press agent. The big super-duper press agent. I read an article about him. He pulls big daffy stunts to put over flop shows and movies. So that's what's going on - a press agent stunt. Here you are, boys. You must've thought we were a bunch of rube journalists. Bells ringing for three days. Quite a gag. If Marcus Harris really wants to put over his picture, tell him he can buy space in the newspapers. Maybe he hasn't heard about that gag called...paid advertising. I think I need this one. OK, boys. I was trying to pull a fast one, but it's not what you're thinking. Everything I told you is true. How about the whole story? The AP doesn't print press agents' copy. Maybe it's a press agent's story, maybe it isn't. Anyway, it's not going to hurt you to listen as long as this bottle holds out. What I want to know is who's putting up for the bells? That's a fair question. The bells are being paid for by yours truly, Bill Dunnigan, with the aid of four bad cheques which I have sinfully given the trusting clergy of Coaltown. I've wired Harris for 10,000 to cover me. If he sends it, fine. If he doesn't... ..our next meeting will be in Coaltown's jail. Why wouldn't he send it? Because when Olga died, he decided to shelve the picture. I'm doing this on my own. I figured ringing the bells would be news - he'd have to release it. The public would demand it. What's your interest in the picture? I don't want to see Olga's talent buried. She died for it. You want to hear why she felt it was worth dying for? OK. Go ahead. Shoot. I'll try to tell you in her own words. She finished the last scene in the picture and collapsed. They took her to the hospital that night. She was so bad, they wouldn't let me see her. But the next morning at daybreak, they sent for me. Hello, Bill. Hello, baby. You tired? Good long rest, and you'll be on your feet again. But you've got to take it easy, hear? No more of that getting there in a hurry. No more. You're going to get better, I'm telling you. Shh. Shh. Bill. Bill... ..will you promise me something? Anything you want, baby. I want to be buried in Coaltown, beside my father and mother on a hill from St Michael's church. Olga, don't talk like that. And I want them to ring the bell for me. They didn't ring it for my father. And six angels with white wings beside the coffin. Don't forget... ..St Michael's. I like to think of the hill outside of Coaltown. I can see it. Bill... Is the picture really good? It's wonderful. You're great in it. I hope it's true... ..because I didn't play Joan alone. A lot of people played her - people you've never seen or heard. My dad... ..and all the other poor, sad people of Coaltown. You'd better not talk, baby. Let me talk, Bill, a little while longer. I want you to know and remember why I did it, why I kept on till this happened. It's because all those poor people, all the people I came from, have hopes and dreams in them that never get a chance. They just work and die, and all the nice things inside them...never come out. And, Bill... ..I came out of them. When they hear me, they'll know... ..it's their own hearts speaking. When they see my name shining in all the theatres, it will be something of theirs shining. Hang on, baby. Hang on. Oh, Bill, I'm...so happy. I did my job. Olga. HE SOBS BELLS RING BELLS RING Do you like them, Olga? They're ringing your name, baby, coast to coast. KNOCK AT DOOR Mr Dunnigan, newspapers. Yeah. Come in. The door's open. Here are the papers you ordered. I put them on the bill, including their delivery - $3.00. Thanks. Father Spinsky's downstairs. He wants to see you. I'll be down as soon as I'm dressed. Well, partner, we swept the country. I got a wire from the office. It went over big. Yeah? Father Spinsky said it was important. I'll be right down. Let me see one of those. Hey, Jonesy, get a load of this Gazette. Not bad, eh? Wonderful. "Born with the gift of laughter and song, "he passed these on to his lovely daughter." Thanks, Jonesy. Think nothing of it. All that can happen is I get fired and spend my life mooching drinks. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Lookee, lookee, lookee, fellas. Oh, you've already seen them. Yeah. Well, here's something you don't know. I heard it when I was having breakfast. The company's going to squawk. The company? The mining interest. The big company that runs this town. Frederick Watson - that monstrous house on the hill - seems he doesn't like the bells. Well, that's too bad. Yeah, but it's serious. He says they have a bad psychological effect. Takes the miners' minds off digging coal. Claims the bells are a nuisance. He can't think straight, so he's going to protest. What can he really do? Plenty. Seems he's the one who gave that bell to St Leo's. He can stop that one easy, then force the others to quit as a public nuisance. Did Los Angeles carry our story? Big. No wire from Marcus. I don't understand it. Or what's worse, maybe I do. If Marcus doesn't kick through... Don't let me think such thoughts. You perhaps do not realise, Mr Dunnigan, how many friends Olga's father had in Coaltown. I met a number of them in Mr Orloff's establishment. All of them will want to attend the funeral. St Michael's would never accommodate them. Oh, good morning, Father Paul. Good morning. Good morning, Father Spinsky. Did you see your name in the paper? St Michael is spread over every front page. I haven't had time to read anything, Bill. The most unusual thing happened - really remarkable. I mean, this morning at Mass. You've already had Mass? Before breakfast? Yes. There were nearly 100 of them. They came to view the coffin, but they stayed for Mass. I was just talking of that, Father Paul. I fear your little church will be overtaxed. There's a busload of sightseers in from Wilkes-Barre already. As a matter of fact, we're really not equipped. We've already run out of candles, but I hope to find some. I'm sure Father Spinsky has some he can spare. It must be clear to you, Mr Dunnigan, from what you've just heard, that it would be wise and sensible to move Olga to St Leo's and let us conduct the funeral from my church. Perhaps it would be better, Bill. If you wish to alter your arrangements, I won't stand in your way or Father Spinsky's. No, Father Paul. Olga is going to be buried from St Michael's. I'm not altering our arrangement. Well, then you've got to tell him. I hoped not to be forced into this position. I came here eager to be of service. Both of us. Please, Mr Orloff. However, I must now read you this telegram which our bank received from the Gotham Exchange bank this morning. "In reply to your query "regarding financial rating, William Dunnigan, "he has account at this bank. "Present balance $300." I shall telephone your bank again at noon. If the money is not in your account, the bell of my church will stop ringing, and I shall inform my fellow pastors of your swindle, and they will also stop their bells. Good day. I'm notifying the town constable just what's going on. You had your chance to stay out of jail, but you were too smart. Please, Mr Orloff. You know, Bill, St Leo's is a very fine church, and she'd have a wonderful sermon and... Run out on St Michael's? Oh, no, Father, forget it. Hey, uh, Father, how much is the bus fare to Nanticoke? Uh, it's 10 cents. $1.00 ought to cover it, then. But I don't understand, Bill. Look, Father, don't make it difficult. I'm putting the bite on you for $1.00. Oh, of course. Thanks. Will that be enough? Not quite. I need another 4,999, but I may be able to pick it up in Nanticoke. See you later. Are you sure there isn't a night letter lying around Wilkes-Barre? I've asked him five times. Oh, that's impossible. He's got to answer. Try him again, will you? Nope. Nothing. People don't break their neck giving $10,000 away. Is that clock up there right? Uh...yep. MACHINE CLICKS Ah, here comes something. For me? Uh... ..yep. Yep. Prepaid. From Harris? Shh. Hey, wait. I can't read that. Shh. Please. Is he sending the money? Shh! I can't make that out. What is that, code or something? Ah. Go on, read it. "William Dunnigan, Coaltown, Pennsylvania. "Have sent $5,000 to bank in Nanticoke "as requested." Cut you down, didn't he? I expected that. They always do. Go on. What's the rest? "As settlement in full of your unexpired contract with me. "Never mind about saving the picture. "My decision not to release it until remade with another star "still stands. Marcus Harris." Thanks. Uh, the bank is just a block down... I know where it is. Harris came through, eh? Yeah. Here's his wire. He's not sold yet. We need something big. I've got to get him boiling over. If we could only get some new angle to hand the papers. We're hitting him with a human interest story only - bells ringing. Unless we get something big to go with the bells, they're worth a box on page three. We've got to cook up some new coast-to-coast headlines. Well, boys, you can calm down. The party's over. Listen while you can. They're mighty pretty, aren't they? They won't be ringing long. What's up? The company. Mr Watson's filed a protest. He's on his way to Father Spinsky's to stop St Leo's bell. No. He can't do that. St Michael, you've got to stop this Watson. St Michael can't do anything. The company's too big. Mr Watson's too important. There must be somebody more important. The governor, maybe, or there's always the president. That's it. Father Paul, do you know the governor of this state? Why, no. Only his name. I don't know the governor, Dunnigan, but his secretary Fred Frisby is my wife's cousin. Can I use the phone? Certainly. Don't worry. I'll pay the charges. I'm not worried. Merely bewildered. Hello, Hattie? This is Bill Dunnigan. Look, this is an emergency. Can you get me right through? I want to talk to Fred Frisby in the governor's mansion in... What's the capital of the state? Harrisburg. Harrisburg. Yes, I'll hold on. "Day of mourning for Olga Treskovna. "Pennsylvania governor issues proclamation. "All denominations to observe star's funeral." I've never seen a campaign like this in all my born days. It'll all be over Friday after the funeral. I know. I understand. How much did he wire for? Another 5,000. We can't release Joan for months. By then this publicity will be as dead as Olga. People don't remember funerals. It's grown bigger every day. But it can't go on, Marcus. I told you yesterday, it's just a flash in the pan. It helps us in no way. PHONE RINGS Hello. This is Mr Harris speaking. Oh, hello, Danny. Yes. What? That's wonderful. I'm sincerely delighted to hear that. Goodbye. Well, gentlemen, that settles it. Miss Genevieve James is available. I was beginning to hope we could go ahead as Dunnigan wanted. Ah, but you're right. We'll remake Joan with a great actress in the part. It'll be a better picture, I'm sure. More legitimate sales campaign. Miss Mulhauser, take a wire to William Dunnigan, Nanticoke, Pennsylvania. That's mighty pretty writing, Tanner. Take a look at this subcolumn head. Detroit. Yeah. If Harris doesn't soften up after all this... Mr Dunnigan, more telegrams. Oh, thanks. You've done a wonderful job, boys. I don't know how to thank you. Des Moines. Signed picture article for the Sunday magazine. It must be almost 3:00. Why don't you fellas knock off? Good idea. I think I'll toddle off to bed. Sounds good to me. Hey, wait a minute. BELLS RING What's the matter, Bill, bad news? No. Someone wants to hire me. They think I'm pretty good. Well, goodnight. See you tomorrow. Yeah. Thanks for a swell fight, boys. THINKS: Well, baby, we didn't do so good. You won't ever act for anybody... but me. I'll hear you. Nobody else. You can quit shining, baby. It's no dice. I let you down. BELLS RING BELLS CONTINUE RINGING BELLS CONTINUE RINGING The statues - look, they're moving! Look at them. The statues are turning. They're turning. They're turning. They're looking at the pulpit. It's a miracle. It's a miracle. Merciful Father. They're looking at the coffin. They turned to the altar. Father, have mercy. Have mercy, Father. Have mercy. Mercy. BELLS CONTINUE RINGING Father Paul. He's down there. In the basement, sir. Father Paul. I saw it, Father Paul. I was in the back of the church. I saw the statues turn. Yes, I know, I know. I started the bells ringing as a gag to get them to release Olga's picture, but I didn't do that upstairs. I had nothing to do with it. I know. The statues turned by themselves and looked at Olga. Yes. I've been investigating it here. Investigating what? The statues turning. Look. You can see. See what? The ground is broken, Bill, at the base of this pillar and all the way across, over to the base of the other. These two pillars support the statues. Are you trying to knock out the miracle? There wasn't any miracle, Bill. There are a lot of old mineshafts under here. The earth isn't too solid. The movement of the pillars made the statues turn. That's it, huh? Yes. At first I was worried about the floor above. It was just a slight sinking of the earth. I had to make sure, Bill. It wasn't a miracle. The pressure did it. What pressure? Of the people above who came to look at the coffin. Our flooring is unused to such crowds. What are you going to do, Father? I'm going up to tell them the truth. You know the truth? Yes. Wait a minute, Father. You're not going to tell them about those mineshafts? I must tell the truth, Bill. The church doesn't accept miracles without investigating them carefully. It's my duty to tell them. It's your duty to take the light out of their faces? I saw them when it happened. I saw those poor, bitter faces shining as if someone had turned a light on inside them, and I heard them giving thanks to the somebody who had turned the statues. Now you're going upstairs and ask them to thank a couple of basement pillars and a piece of broken ground. Look, Father Paul, maybe I want a miracle because I'm a press agent, but I'm not thinking of putting over a movie now. Whoever turned those statues wasn't selling a picture for Marcus Harris. I tell you, Father, God was trying to say, "Life's all right. "It's not as bad as it seems. "I'm up here watching and trying to help." If he didn't say it, if nobody up there said it, it's been said, because it's in their hearts now. It'll go out all over the world. And if God doesn't speak like that out of Heaven, he'll be speaking out of people's hearts. And what's the difference where he speaks from? Your job isn't to hide his word, is it? BELLS CONTINUE RINGING No, it isn't to hide his word. The saints came to Joan of Arc because she believed in God and wanted to help the people of France. Olga believed in God just as much. She wanted to help the people of Coaltown just as much. Give her the chance, Father Paul. Come with me, Bill. BELLS RING Something strange and wonderful has happened. The faces of the Blessed Virgin and St Michael have turned to look on one who lies among us in a coffin. I will not speak of what made the statues turn. Others will tell you the answer to that later. I speak to you of no other miracle than the one we know - the miracle of the Olgas of the world... ..of those who live and dream only to bring Heaven into our lives, if it is no more than a smile of fellowship or a moment of beauty. Olga died for this, that the world might see through her toil and sacrifice the beauty there was in the tired and lonely hearts of her people. I know what makes a saint, and I also know what makes a beautiful human being. Such a one lies now at our feet. Let us pray for her. ORGAN PLAYS PRAYING IN LATIN This is Jones of the Associated Press. Get me the AP in New York and reverse the charges. Hurry up. Just a moment. "Coaltown, Pennsylvania - "the little mining town "which is already the focus of national attention "as a result of its church bells ringing "for the funeral of Olga Treskovna "is today the scene of a new sensation. Shortly before Mass began in the church of St Michael, two large marble statues weighing many hundreds of pounds were seen to move and turn as if to look at the coffin of Olga, which lies before the altar. All who saw the turning of the statues are convinced that it was a miracle. Explanations are being offered that a movement of earth beneath the church, which is honeycombed with old mining tunnels, moved the pillars on which the statues stand. The bishop is sending a representative to Coaltown to investigate. But whether miracle or not attended Olga's coffin, the life of this young actress reads like the story of a latter-day saint. HE KNOCKS Mr Harris. Mr Harris. Sorry to break in like this, Mr Harris. Something tremendous has happened. There's a mob of newspaper reporters downstairs. What's happened? What are you talking about? The miracle. A tremendous miracle! Wh-what miracle? Where? In Coaltown. Oh, no, don't tell me. This is too much. Listen, Marcus, a miracle has happened to Olga Treskovna. I won't hear such bunk. It's sacrilegious. If Dunnigan thinks... It isn't Dunnigan. Two huge stone statues at the altar looked at Olga in her coffin. What do you mean, it isn't Dunnigan? Do you think God is interested in selling movies for me? I never heard such bunk, and you believe it. The whole country believes it. Let me explain... Don't explain anything. This time Dunnigan's gone too far. Miracles. We're signing Genevieve James, so he pulls a miracle. When a man starts fooling people about religion, starts faking miracles as a press agent's stunt, I'm through with him. This is the real thing. The statues turned. People saw. They paid someone to turn them. Don't you believe in miracles? You've just made a picture about one, Joan of Arc. I believe in miracles. I was brought up to believe in God and in miracles... ..if he made them, but the difference is as follows - Moses didn't pay anyone to hold back the Red Sea, Daniel didn't pay to get out of the lion's den, and Jonah didn't pay to get out of that whale. I won't stand for any press agent miracles. I'm going downstairs and expose Dunnigan and tell those newspaper people he's the biggest faker in America! Here it is on the radio. RADIO: Here's the distinguished correspondent Mr Quentin Reynolds, who has flown here to report on the amazing happening in the church of St Michael the Archangel. Mr Reynolds. REYNOLDS: The whole country is asking, "Did a miracle occur in Coaltown?" But here in the little mining community, no-one asks that question. Every man, woman, and child here believes that the grace of God has touched them. To them, a miracle has happened. What is a miracle? The word "miracle" comes from the Latin, and it means, "a wonderful thing." Well, most certainly a wonderful thing has happened here, something so wondrous that it has torn the bitterness and the doubts from the hearts of the people and brought them back to God. Whether this is a miracle or not - that's up to the church authorities to decide, but I do know this - when Olga Treskovna was brought home, a wonderful thing happened, and everyone here is convinced that somehow divine providence is blessing Coaltown and the people in it. BELLS RING It'll take some time to answer all these letters, and tomorrow there'll be more. You don't answer them. You get a secretary to answer them. A secretary? Oh, no. They were written to me. We are being given a new organ, a new roof for the church, a dozen new altar cloths, and two stained glass windows, and my desk is full of cheques for the poor, and the world has come to St Michael's to pray. I must thank you, Bill. Thank me? Isn't that a little funny coming from you? You mean you still believe in the miracle? I've been standing in the church most of the day. I haven't sent out a line of copy. You remember when I told you how I couldn't tell Olga what I felt? This is the second time in my life I've been dumb. I can't tell the world this. That's how I know it's real, Father, because I'm no good at selling anything that's real. I guess I'm through here. You're through? Mr Bill Dunnigan, you're just beginning. Marcus! I'm happy to see you. Hello, Marcus. Hello, fellas. This is Father Paul. Mr Harris, Mr Wilde, Mr Tanby - straight from Hollywood. I'm very glad to know you. Father. Bill, I'm a man who knows when he's licked. You win - you, Father Paul, St Michael, Olga... ..a couple of statues. We've decided to release the picture as quickly as possible. You have, huh? We're going to put Olga Treskovna into theatres in every city in the country. You're going to make the picture a tremendous success, Bill. I'll tell you what she's going to do, your Olga... ..she's going to build a hospital for Coaltown, the biggest, the best that money can buy. A clinic for her people for the study of this disease from which she died, so that someday soon there will be no such disease - people won't be dying from it - because Olga Treskovna died for them, worked and died for them. This is a great thing you're doing, Mr Harris. It's beyond anything any of us dreamed. Maybe. I don't know how all this started, but... ..in my religion, when something happens that makes the world a little better place that it was before, then I know that God had something to do with it. I don't ask any questions. In my religion, too, Mr Harris. CHURCH BELLS RING OLGA: When they hear me, they'll know it's their own hearts speaking, and when they see my name shining in all the theatres, it'll be something of theirs shining. I am so happy. I did my job.
