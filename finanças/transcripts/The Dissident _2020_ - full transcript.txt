I didn't want to believe in the beginning, what happened to Jamal. Prominent Saudi journalist and Washington Post columnist has gone missing after visiting his country's consulate in Istanbul. Yes, I knew that I was doing something dangerous. But I didn't know that, you know, we're going to lose so many lives because of it. On Tuesday, Jamal Khashoggi entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul but hasn't been seen since. Saudi and Turkish officials have given conflicting accounts on the whereabouts of Jamal Khashoggi, who's known for criticizing Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's policy inside Saudi Arabia. Once an adviser and friend of Saudi's royal and elites, he now lives in self-exile in the U.S. and is an outspoken critic of his government's policies. Turkish authorities believe prominent Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, has been killed. ...what I want in my retirement. I'm 60 years old, and I want to enjoy life, and I want to be free. Unfortunately, the government treated me as if I shot the King, God forbid, and I ran away. As I am a traitor. After his death, Jamal became a hero. We cry when we hear that the hero is killed. But his works, his cause, his vision, it would live forever. What do you know about the bees? We know from here that he entered this embassy and didn't come out. ...in Istanbul, seekingpaperwork to marry his fiancée. His fiancée saw him go in at 1:00 p.m. and was still waiting for him after 1:00 a.m. Saudi officials have denied that a prominent Saudi journalist is in their custody. Jamal Khashoggi has reportedly been missing for more than 24 hours. Turkey says that they will be cooperating with Saudi authorities to resolve the incident. The consulate said it had no comment when asked why he never came out. Can you tell me what happened to Mr. Khashoggi? What happened to Mr. Khashoggi? Did you talk to him? Okay. Jamal-- Jamal Khashoggi. Jamal Ahmad Khashoggi. Right. Okay. What year was that, Jamal, that you graduated? - Eighty-one. Yes. - Nineteen eighty-one? Business Administration degree from Indiana State. But since then, I'm happy to see from his biography, Jamal is a rara avis, at least in our society, full-time long-term professional journalist. He doesn't seem tempted to be doing anything else. Saudi Arabia is a monarchy. I mean, the king has ruled that it should happen. - On Twitter? - On Twitter. I was criticizing everything except the royal family. But I didn't have a very huge audience. I was just a regular guy with hundred followers. The Saudi King's jet carries its own royal staircase. Waiting at the bottom of it at Gatwick Airport this morning were the Prince and Princess of Wales. The king of one of the most closed societies in the world looking at ease in this more open one. The Saudi government and the monarchy has evolved significantly over the last 80 years, basically, since the kingdom was founded. The founder of Saudi Arabia, King Abdulaziz, had about 37 sons or so. And political power, as well as economic power, was distributed among those sons. A pivotal country saw a lavish welcome for the man who controls nearly half the world's oil reserves. Once King Abdulaziz died, the crown was passed through to his son, to his son, to his son. King Salman became the king and the game has completely changed. A new king reigns in a country with enormous sway over the world economy and the war on terror. While in the past, the king really had to rely on a lot of his brothers in order to govern the kingdom. When they passed from the scene, more and more powers concentrated in the hands of his heirs, and that's the situation we have today. Saudi Arabia has granted Turkish investigators permission to enter and search. This is history. Protesters forcing change earlier this year in Tunisia, now succeeding in forcing change in Egypt after nearly 30 years of Mubarak rule. That's two Arab leaders in two months. Arab governments are watching closely, wary that a revolution might be headed to their country next. The military's crackdown on opposition in Egypt had resulted in over 14,000 people thrown in jail. John, good morning. I'm on a new phone. Uh, this is temporary. Let's not exchange sensitive information until you arrive. But this is how to get in touch with me until then. I tell people that Jamal and I were not supposed to be friends. I mean, I'm a pretty well-known dissident. But in 2012, he started following me on Twitter. He was very interested in social media in terms of the phenomena. Saudi Arabia has an unprecedented online population. We know that there's no free speech. So, Twitter became the parliament of the Arabs. ...already proposed a series of economic and social changes under the banner of Saudi Vision 2030. The highly anticipated 2030 Vision seems to radically change the image of the Kingdom. The man behind it all, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is regarded as a progressive leader, touting social and economic reforms. And critics say, MBS, as he's known, is also power hungry. I had met Mohammed Salman when he was Chief of Staff to his father. We understood that he was very ambitious, a very impatient, and a favorite son. He pushed aside King Salman's half-brother, Prince Muqrin and the Crown Prince, Muhammad Nayef. He's being described as the power behind the throne, and has had a hand in nearly everything in the Kingdom. He is emancipating women, introducing music and cinema, and cracking down on corruption. This is an American first, never before has a president set foot on Saudi soil for his first trip abroad. America will not seek to impose our way of life on others, but to outstretch our hands in the spirit of cooperation and trust. What my sources told me was the Saudis and Mohammed bin Salman, in particular, were trying to forge a relationship with people in The White House, and most particularly with Jared Kushner, who's the President's son-in-law and Senior Advisor. Three billion dollars, $533 million, $525 million. That's peanuts for you. You should've increased it. Eight hundred... He said that he's milking the country. I'm sure Saudi Arabian officials were caught off-guard by the election of Mr. Trump. Now... I think all of us, as Saudis, should worry about it. I strongly believe that the struggle for democracy in the Middle East are the core of all problems. When Jamal heard that statement, he was shocked. By 2017, Jamal had an enormous audience. MBS put together a plan to control the public sphere. Saud al-Qahtani, MBS's right-hand man, managed to implement this plan... ...creating Twitter army of trolls to control the freedom of speech. Al-Qahtani worked behind the scenes as an enforcer for the Crown Prince. Qahtani was known for targeting those who spoke out against Riyadh on Twitter. They're not dissidents. The people were not even being dissidents. These were the thought-makers, the opinion-makers of Saudi society. Writers and intellectuals. For the first time, we are now hearing from the fiancée of WashingtonPost reporter Jamal Khashoggi... ...has called on U.S. lawmakers to hold Saudi Arabia accountable. His fiancée says she'll fight to ensure everyone who is responsible for his death is brought to justice. Yeah. I need 10 minutes. Yes. We need to cross the opening... Absolutely. But let's go... If we can just announce the press briefing. And is there any questions? If there's questions, we cannot... I said, "But here's the thing. Not every single one of them trusts you." You are saying that Jamal might be a spy. I met Jamal in Washington after a manor connected me to him. I think we bonded a lot over food. Heh. Like most, I guess, Middle Easterners. He told me that he had moved to the U.S. and that he was all alone and didn't know what was happening for the first time in his life at age 60. I remember he started tearing up, telling me how his wife whom he had loved very, very much, she wasn't okay with it. She-- Nobody was. His kids weren't okay with it. Nobody was okay with it. Everything was left behind and the country-- 60 years of his life-- everything. He struggled with it every single day. In Saudi Arabia, he was the biggest insider. And then, all of a sudden, he finds himself on the outside, on the very much outside. I felt, like, for him to settle emotionally, mentally, physically, he needed to write again. I was a friend of Jamal Khashoggi's for about 15 years. When he came toThe Washington Post, he was transported. This was something that he had dreamed about. You have to understand what it's like to be a journalist in Saudi Arabia. Every time you try to say something that's tough-minded, you get fired. He was the sort of person that just couldn't take a pass. If he felt something, he just insisted on writing it. I watched him get fired from a series of jobs in Saudi Arabia, each time because he just couldn't stop himself from saying what he thought was true. All we want from you this time is to like and subscribe. We're seeing a truly historic upheaval unfold right now. A royal purge in Saudi Arabia. King Salman ordered the creation of a new anti-corruption committee headed by son, Prince Mohammed Salman. November of 2017, Mohammed Bin Salman basically rounds up the most powerful people in Saudi Arabia, puts them in the Ritz in Riyadh, basically a five-star prison, and shakes them down for a lot of money, over a $100 billion. Mohammed Bin Salman ordered the arrest of powerful princes, ministers, and investors. Some are his rivals in the royal family. Is this also about sending a message that, as we say in America, there's a new sheriff in town? Jamal was starting to realize that there's little he can do for his country from his position other than to write. Jamal Khashoggi was kind of a black box of the ruling elites in Saudi Arabia. It is easy to sit and say we need, particularly in front of American audience, we need more freedom, we need more-- these are golden things. Everybody loves them. --You have to be practical. I'm not asking for democracy, I'm asking for people to be allowed to speak. This is-- I'm asking for the minimum. In summer 2018, they were attacking him basically every single day, threatening him, trying to silence him. So Jamal felt the whole country was against him. And that was hurting him. He said, "Sometimes, I feel a lot like "I don't wanna talk about anything. I don't wanna expose my opinions." I said, "No, no, no. You're just a victim of what we call the Flies." The government hired thousands of people. Every one of them using 10, 20 accounts. The moment they think critic of the government has posted, the flies swarmed, attacking with hundreds of negative replies. Within minutes, the tweet is covered in pro-government comments and hashtags, causing the person's voice to be lost. Then each fly posts pro-government articles and hashtags, supporting MBS's vision. And all of the fly can repost thousands of those tweets... forcing the state's false narrative to the top of trending inside the country. This is the whole Twitter monster that Saud al-Qahtani created and you have the troll master himself on the top. I could get hundreds of volunteers from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Yemen, other countries. Each armed with two, three phones, generating hundreds of accounts. But first we would have to make sure that they are protected. Anyone tweeting inside Saudi Arabia will be immediately identified since the government owns all this other networks. So to mask their identities, we must give them American or Canadian safeguards. To battle The Flies, we will call ourselves The Bees Army. We would organize the volunteers into groups of 40 or 50 bees, each reporting to a supervising lieutenant. Once I give the command, each lieutenant will tell their bee soldier a specific tweet or hashtag to protect. But we're not going to use the same method. Give them the freedom to say whatever they want. The Flies will, of course, attack. But if our numbers are stronger, we will be able to rise above the propaganda machine... and finally install freedom of speech inside the Kingdom. Jamal was really happy of the idea. He said, "Brilliant, I really like it." Focusing all our efforts on one hashtag, So the moment he left, they called Saud al-Qahtani's office? And that was the turning point. It started trending. Jamal was surprised, so then he started to tweet with us, he tweeted it. And then we did it. Number one trending in Saudi Arabia. And suddenly... he's not answering. He's just gone, disappeared. When I heard this, I was driving to my house. My friends calling me continuously. Come on, Jamal Khashoggi. It's news. I called a couple of journalists based in Istanbul like Reuters, Al Jazeera, Washington Post. There's really not a playbook for this type of situation, but we did know that we needed to act quickly. Within hours, we had a letter dispatched through the ambassador and through the United States government to the Crown Prince. I'd ask to meet with the Saudi ambassador of the U.S. who happens to be the brother of the Crown Prince. First response was that he was looking into the matter. First day, there was 10 or 12 journalists waiting outside. The day after, hundreds. He entered this embassy... Two days later, 200. We demand his immediate release if alive. I am concerned about it. I don't like hearing about it. And hopefully, that will sort itself out. Right now, nobody knows anything about it, but there's somepretty bad stories going around. I do not like it. Thank you. I'll see you. I'll see you at 10:00. I will not let you down and I will not stop defending you. Always be well. To breaking news now, we are getting reports that Turkish authorities believe that prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi has been killed. - Jamal Khashoggi-- - Jamal Khashoggi-- We heard one lie after another from the Saudi government. Saudi Arabia has denied angrily that it abducted, harmed, or killed Khashoggi. Now suddenly, the country is admitting that Khashoggi did die inside that building. We heard that he suffocated accidentally. We heard that there was a drug administered that had an unintended effect. The government now says he died in a fist fight. A Saudi agent was captured on surveillance cameras in Istanbul wearing Khashoggi's clothes. The Washington Post has just posted the last piece Jamal Khashoggi wrote, filed shortly before he was seen entering that Saudi consulate in Turkey. Tonight, there are still many unanswered questions in his disappearance. Earlier today, Turkish investigators search the residence of... This one. The court has issued arrest warrants for two additional suspects in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi. Ahmed al-Asiri was the country's Deputy Intelligence Chief and high-ranking adviser to the Crown Prince. Saud al-Qahtani was a Royal Court Adviser and key counselor to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The chief prosecutor who's been holding a joint investigation with his Saudi counterpart this week issued a statement following their talks. He says discussions yielded no concrete results, despite Turkey's intentions to reveal the truth. Sir, can you say anything from the investigation? Where is Khashoggi's body? My name is John Scott-Railton. I'm a senior researcher at a place called The Citizen Lab. It's this group of researchers and investigators that try to understand the digital things that are targeting civil society, so journalists, activists, everybody really, who's part of what constitutes a flourishing democracy. It's almost a miracle that we found Omar. It's a miracle that he survived this long. There's sort of a growing global market for spyware. Governments want to listen to encrypted phone calls. They wanna read your WhatsApp chats, your Signal chats, and they can't do it as that chat goes across their network. So, their solution to this is, let's hack the phone. Was the CIA aware that the Saudis had purchased spyware from Israel? I'm not going to confirm or deny. That's either-- We're aware of certain things. All's I will say is that the Saudi services are able to have insight into what their citizens or what even non-Saudi citizens were doing inside the Kingdom and outside. Saudi Arabia is definitely a major player in the space. Throughout my entire career, I focused on the top four-- Russia, China, Iran, North Korea. And I think it's safe to say that Saudi Arabia has comparable skills and abilities to conduct cyber operations. I think it's important for people to understand how easy it is to access these tools. Thanks to an Israeli company called NSO, the Saudis have the best hacking technology that money can buy. Pegasus Version Two. Pegasus is a piece of software, but it's also a capability, it's the capability to infect a phone and turn it into a digital spy in the pocket of the victim-- siphoning off private and encrypted chats, photographs, messages, even enabling the microphone and the camera, turn that phone into a bug in a room. They sent a malicious link. The link looks legit, you know, it looks like, for example, you know, boarding pass, you click on it and it actually goes where it's supposed to go, but in between, it's downloading something into your device. Once it compromises mobile devices, the end user of the Pegasus tool has unfettered access to that device. Think of your phone today, the people you talk to, the photos you take, the places you go, the things that you say around and into your phone, right? This is a huge slice of your life. And that stuff is tremendously valuable to somebody who wants to monitor you, who wants to figure out what you're doing and maybe who wants to subvert your political activity. Once Pegasus takes control of a phone, it's game over. To share information, an infected device is gonna be talking to the servers that control it. It has to phone home. And so we had developed a technique to see what networks might have infected devices. So, what we found in Montreal in December 2018 is that there appeared to be a device in the University Network phoning home to a cluster of servers that belonged to Saudi Arabia's Pegasus deployment. So, we go to Montreal, we sit with Omar and actually find the message on Omar's phone that we believe led to that infection. It looks like a DHL shipping tracking notification. Only it isn't. Are you being allowed in? Are the Saudis allowing you in? Some of the tape recordings we've heard preceded the killing. "Joints will be separated. "It's not a problem. The conversation turns to, "Will you come back to Saudi Arabia?" The fear is escalating in his voice. Then we hear a struggle. You can hear the other people The most difficult part of those recordings I was thinking, when he entered his consulate... The king firmly denied any knowledge of it. I don't wanna get into his mind. But it sounded to me like maybe these could have been rogue killers. Who knows? World leaders are gathering in Saudi Arabia for a summit commonly known as "Davos in the desert." A couple weeks after the murder, there was a big, important conference for Saudi Arabia. Davos in the desert is supposed to promote Saudi Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman's reform vision for the Kingdom. Davos in the desert is the make or break part of Vision 2030. But it ended up being a fiasco for MBS. The Jamal story galvanized public attention in the United States, around the world. It may destroy MBS' hopes for modernizing the Kingdom because he needs investors, he needs people who invest in the Kingdom. And right now, he has become toxic. As pressure on Saudi mounts, several U.S. media organizationsand business leaders have pulled out of a major investment conference in Riyadh. The conference happens, all those important guests eventually don't go. Jeff Bezos was supposed to be a secret guest. Bezos is someone with a direct relationship with MBS. They messaged each other. They talked about business. They talked about, you know, all the great things they're gonna do together. And he was supposed to declare this enormous deal at this conference. But after the murder, Bezos just stopped all contact with MBS. Bezos owns The Washington Post, which means that Jamal worked for him. It seemed that MBS expected Bezos to say, "You know what? "I control this newspaper and I can curb them. I can tell them, you know, don't make a big deal about this." But when push came to shove, Bezos did not interfere whenThe Washington Post started a whole campaign. "Justice for Jamal". MBS saw that as betrayal. After Davos in the desert, we have evidence that Jeff Bezos' phone had been infected with malware. And the way in which that technology was delivered to his phone was through a text from the Crown Prince himself. I am the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression. The work that I've been doing over the last 18 months or so is on the private surveillance industry. A video was sent in 2018 from MBS' WhatsApp account to Jeff Bezos' phone. Then we see this massive increase in data leaving the phone. It was only after the killing of Jamal Khashoggi thatThe Washington Post was an important target for Saudi Arabia. This was exactly the moment whenThe National Enquirer was saying to Bezos, "We have evidence connecting you to an affair." So Bezos' security team is learning that his phone may have been compromised. But at the same time, Bezos is getting WhatsApp messages from MBS that are strange. Essentially, "Whatever you're hearing about Saudi involvement in this is not true." In order to send those kinds of text messages, MBS has to know what Bezos is learning about Saudi involvement. And then what we see is that there's this massive Saudi online campaign, a Twitter campaign, against Jeff Bezos. The intention was to humiliate and to punish Bezos. It was exactly the same thing that they did to Jamal. That mere fact that MBS has the reach to conduct surveillance on the richest man in the world is not only striking, but it's scary. Earlier today, CIA Director, Gina Haspel briefed a select group of high ranking senators on the killing ofWashington Post columnist, Jamal Khashoggi. The CIA Director, Gina Haspel met with the Turks and said, "Show me the audio. Let me hear it." The CIA Director's job is to present the information to a policymaker so they can make a decision on how to act. This assessment was different. If the Crown Prince went in front of a jury, he would be convicted in 30 minutes. Yes. They're buying hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of things from this country. I'm not gonna destroy the economy for our country by being foolish with Saudi Arabia, so... There's not a smoking gun, there's a smoking saw. You have to be willfully blind not to come to the conclusionthat this was orchestrated and organized by people in-- under the command of MBS. Did MBS lie to you, sir? He told me thathe had nothing to do with it. - But what if he's lying?-As recently as a few days ago. Did you just live with it because you need him? Well, will anybody really know, all right? Will anybody really know? I have not seen, in 20 years covering intelligence, the conclusion from the CIA that is this confident about the role of one person in an act. Everybody but the President agrees that Mohammed bin Salman ordered Jamal Khashoggi's assassination. Nine, eight, seven... The first day they broadcast, Jamal invites Shiite dissidents on the air, who were the people who the Bahrainian authorities most feared. Are we so blind to the malign influence of Saudi Arabia that we just give money and weapons to anybody regardless of what they do? You can cut a dissident into pieces with a bone saw and we'll still give you weapons? Thank you. I now give the floor to Saudi Arabia. Thank you. Accusations have been launched and fingers have been pointed, we reject any attempt to remove this from our national justice system in Saudi Arabia in respect to the form that that may take. Many thanks. Did you order the murder of Jamal Khashoggi? Absolutely not. Some think that I should know what three million people working for the Saudi government do daily? Absolutely not. My name is Hatice Cengiz. I'm addressing you as a victim, a title forced on me after the brutal murder of my Jamal. Jamal and I would have been husband and wife by now. The failure to punish Jamal's murderers affects us all. But also democracy, human rights, and freedom. Mr. Chair, the truth always wins. History will take note. Please take action. Thank you. Hatice, you paced that street and waiting for hours. No one should ever have to endure what you did. We are here and you are not alone.
