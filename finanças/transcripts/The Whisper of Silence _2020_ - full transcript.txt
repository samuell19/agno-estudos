I had to do what I had to do. God sees everything, my child, everything. But now, don't you tell anyone about this. “The beast has trampled, under his course locks, The trembling little body, soft as a fleece, Has ground the flesh, has ground the bones And has crushed the heart like a cherry.” Gabriela Mistral -Hi dear... How are you? -I'm good... What would you like? -Good... I like to buy some eggs please. -Sure... just grab them. How many would you like? -Four. -Okay... here is the money. -Thank you. -God bless you... take care. Thank you. What happened? Look, a deer. Where? See the face and the horns. Let's go. Hurry up. Thank you. Josefina. Perfect. Thanks. Dalia. God is not happy today. He doesn't love us. Don't say that, Alfredo. He loves us. Remember that. Always. I miss her so much. I didn't want to bring you bad news, but... I feel I have to talk to someone because... I can't hold in all these feelings. You can't imagine how much I miss you. My little brother misses you too. He told me that. I came... to tell you that I love you, that I miss you very much and that I'm living with my godmother. But why don't you tell me how you are. I don't want to tell you bad things anymore. Look how pretty you are. Now you even have plants growing. Aren't you embarrassed? Look at your neighbors. You are the prettiest. I know you are the prettiest. You don't have many flowers but... Thank you, mommy. The square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. The square of the hypotenuse... is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. No, I don't know. Do you want me to ask the teacher? No, it does not matter. Let me see. Silly. You know what I want? You know what I want? To join a circus and become a clown. Well, you're good at that. Right, silly monkey? -You think so? -I do. -You think so? -I do... You think so, you think so? You think so, you think so? You think so, you think so? No, no, no, no. No! What happened? Nothing. No, no. Don't worry, I won't hurt you. No, no, no. No, it's okay. No, no, it's not okay. Please don't move. I'll be right back. What are you doing? Come, come. Let's go. Who are they? They're tasters. Tasters? Yes, the ones that taste coffee. You're going to be fine. Don't worry, okay? But it is very important that you rest so you can go back to work. Josefina! I have to go. Let's go! Let's go, let's go! Thank God it's not broken, my child. I have to go far from here, godmother. Where...? Where? You can't keep running your whole life. I know what I'm saying, look, with the help of God... time heals everything. What are you doing, girl? I saw it in the plantation, godmother. They were tasting coffee. You know? It was very strange. There were many different smells and... I don't know... It was... extraordinary. And... did you get all the smells? Well... I'd like to know them all. I can imagine. Hello! I brought you some mangos. -Oh, you're so nice. -How are you? -Thank you. -Hi! How are you? -How are you? -Fine. How's your foot? Well, so-so. It still hurts, but getting better. So? Why are you here? What a nice surprise. I owed Mrs. Lidia some money... so I thought, while I was here, I would bring you some mangos. Thanks. And... your brother? At school. Why? I saw him two days ago with Miguel and some other boys. They're the worst in town, Josefina. Miguel just got out of jail. Where and when did you see him? At about 10:30. I was coming from the doctor with Isabelita. So... be careful. You want something to drink? I must get to work, it's late. Alright. Thank you. I hope your foot gets better. Don't you want something to drink? No, I'll come by another day. -Bye. -Bye! -Take care. -Thank you for the mangos! Okay. You want to learn to taste coffee, right? Come here, get closer. Look... This one is not the best product, but it will work for now... so you can understand. If you're not going back to school, you should come and work with me. But I'm coming from school. Don't lie to me, Alfredo. Dalia saw you two days ago with some bad guys. What's going on with you? You only have one year left of school! What are you trying to do? Who are you trying to fool? Me? Our mother, who is in heaven? Alfredo! Alfredo, this won't solve anything! Don't exaggerate. You'll see, it will be enough. I'll tell him then. Okay, I've already done it. Good evening. Alfredo, come here. So what are you thinking, that you can come and go here whenever you want? That's not okay, son. Alfredo! Don't disrespect your godmother. I am sorry, godmother. Are you hungry? No, thanks. I ate already. -You ate already? -Yes. -Good night. -Good night. Get some rest. Don't worry. Boys are like that when they are growing up. I guess. Don't worry... it'll pass. Miguelita, Miguelita. What's all that noise? Get rid of that! You'll burn me! Bottoms up! Stop that attitude. What do you want for Christmas? What do I want for Christmas? I want you to work, to get a decent job. You're such a lazy ass. Stop it, stop it. Hit him! Hit him! Go. Hello. Good morning, Mr. Carlos. Excuse me, Mrs. Maria. Can I ask you a question about Josefina? Yes, for sure. With pleasure. -Please, come in. -Thanks. I think it's time you meet Mr. Villagran. Why? I took the liberty of telling him about your talent. What talent? Mrs. Maria isn't good at keeping secrets. Oh, no. I'm sorry to interrupt. Do you remember what I told you? Yes... the... the young lady is called... -Josefina. -Josefina, yes, yes. Well, she's outside. What is she doing? So... you are Josefina. Let's see what you can do. I don't have all day, young lady. This one is fruity. It tastes like plum. This one is fruity too, but it has a hint of tangerine. This one has a hint of caramel. Gentlemen, please leave. Sit down, Josefina. Please. How did you learn to taste? My godmother taught me a month ago. A month ago? Ever since I can remember, I've been able to smell things that no one could. My first memories are of smells. The smell of the eucalyptus and cinnamon trees from my grandmother's house. It was like... a sour bomb in my nose. Even though she lived far... it felt very close to me. I can remember my mother's smell. As soon as she crossed the bridge, I knew she was on her way home. Just by her smell, that sweaty chocolate scent. I know when it's going to rain... because I can smell the wet soil from a distance. I know the smell of every flower. They are very distinctive. And I feel strange because it's a... a feeling as if death was near me. For example, I don't like the smell of garlic. It bothers me. It makes me feel anxious. I have to cook it with onions and rosemary to be able to calm down. I love the smell of cow poop. I know when a person is sad or happy just by their smell. I know when they are full of hate... or resentment. I must thank Carlos for bringing you to me. I will see you here tomorrow... at 7:30 a.m. What's that shit? What's up, little fuckers? -Looks good, dude! -Look at this shit. Hey, get in! Get in. Come on... My cousin gave me two hours with this thing because he needs it for work. This shit isn't discreet at all. Get in, get in. Let's go... Let's go! -Godmother. -What's going on? Mr. Villagran wants to see me tomorrow morning. God, what happened? He let me taste coffee. Oh, that's great! That's great! I did everything you said. Well, you're very talented, I told you. You just had to practice more. We have so much to do... We have to go see... Mauricio Campos, yes. You have to meet Mr. Campos. He worked at La Vastilla coffee plant. He'll give us great advice. -Can we make it today? -Of course! But we have to change and get ready. Come! So what's up? The bike will stay here? Yes, leave it there... Higher up the bike will make too much noise. You sure about this shit? Yes, bro. We just have to go past those trees. Up there we'll find the house. This is gonna be easy. Don't be so sure... In the evening, there's a security guard doing rounds on a horse. At around 11, he takes a break. That'll be our chance. We'll have about 20 minutes. Plenty of time. That coffee is quite complex. It's kind of tangy, and... it smells of nutmeg. When did you buy that coffee? You have a rare and unique talent, Josefina. You must put it to good use. You know? After losing Rosita in the war, your godmother... it's like she lost that passion for life. She was an excellent taster. She could've gone a long way. So... don't waste your talent, Josefina. Dalia! -Hi. -Hi. Have you seen my brother? No, I haven't. Where is he? Where are the guys you told me about? -Miguel and all of them? -Yes. I think they live down there, close to the church. About five minutes away. Wait... why? Josefina, what happened? I can't find him! Mrs. Rubi. Mrs. Rubi! -Hi. -Hi. Have you seen Alfredo? Yes, I saw him. He was around, playing with some guys. -That way? -Yes, over there. They were over there. Hello. Hello! Damn it! What do you want? I'm looking for my brother Alfredo. I was told he was here with Miguel. Are you his mother? No, he's my nephew. What the hell do you want? I want to talk to him. Damn! Get that piece of shit out of here. He's there! Come on. Go! Alfredo? Alfredo! What are you doing here? No, what are you doing here? What are you doing here, sweetie? Come in, there's room for you too. Don't grab me like that, Alfredo. Come here. Alfredo, wait! What's wrong with you? Everything will be better. But everything is good. -What are you talking about? -Soon you'll understand. I'll understand what? Come home with me now. No! Stop treating me like a kid! Well, stop behaving like one! What did those boys put in your head? Josefina! Josefina! Mr. Villagran understand what happened to you. But you must understand that this is the only chance... Yes. Just tell me what time and I'll be there. Tomorrow at 7 a.m. I think that should work. Motherfuckers. Cheer up, you fuckers! You're always down. Cheer up, dudes! Alfredo, let's focus on what's important. What about tomorrow? Are you gonna have the ride? Of course, my brotha. The ride is ready... to take us straight to the top, big daddy! All ready. I'll have my uncle's gun ready. No, man, no. No guns. Fuck it, Alfredo. This shit is serious. They're gonna bust our asses. For real. I won't do it without the gun. You can try and do it yourself. Fuck it. We need the gun. Are you stupid or what? Alright. Everything is ready then. Breathe deeply. Listen to your heart beat. Here we go. Slowly, slowly. Slowly, slowly. Pick it up, open it and... Perfect, perfect. Alright. Want to do it again? Yes, perfect, perfect. Listen, Josefina. I think Alfredo should continue to go to school. Yes, that's my everyday struggle. Well, because cutting sugar cane... that kills the body. I know. It's a tough job. So, why are you sending him to work then? What do you mean? No, I'm sorry. It's none of my business. No, I don't get what you are saying. No, actually I don't know. Look... Let's keep going. Excuse me, Mr. Mauricio. Josefina! Alfredo! -What are you doing here? -No, I'm asking you. What are you doing here? Come with me! I have to work. You have to study. Come with me! Stop! Didn't you wanted me to work? I want to help, and this is the only way I can. This isn't what I wanted for you, Alfredo. Alfredo! Josefina. Josefina. Are you ready? Dalia! Dalia. Hey. I did it! What happened? -Alfredo. -What happened to Alfredo? Mrs. Celia told me that they got into someone's house, and in the process, the owner of the house killed somebody. Alfredo is in jail. Where are you going? To look for Alfredo. You have to wait until Sunday. I'm sorry. I'm sorry... I'm sorry. Come in! What did they do to you? It doesn't matter. Six years. They are giving me six-years. I won't last. What happened? What happened? I wanted him to pay for what he did to you. What are you talking about? Don Gil... This is a Bourbon... through a washing process. This one is a Bourbon too, but in its natural process. This one feels really burnt, but in grain form. One. Two. Three. Four. Mr. Mauricio, I definitely think that the best cup is the second one. It has a... very soft body. It's acidic, but not too much. It's... a Geisha going through a natural process. And it's high altitude Arabica. I definitely pick that one. Perfect. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to San Marcos. In 1847, my great grandfather planted the first coffee seeds that eventually made it to Mazatlan city, Mexico. Now, our country competes internationally with the best coffees from around world. That has been our goal generation after generation. Today, we are happy to have a great competition. I think all of our tasters are exceptional. What are we waiting for? Let the competition begin. Get set. Go. Done! Done. Done. The winner. All cups perfect. With a record time of 2 minutes and 45 seconds, the winner is... Josefina. Congratulations. Sometimes, I would like for my mom to be here... and Alfredo too. I know. Thank you, Dalia, for your friendship. Just don't forget about me when you're famous. Oh, don't talk nonsense. You're funny. We still have to wait, I guess. A boy? Yes, thank God. Don't worry. It'll be here soon. Yes, about three months. I was talking about the bus. Ah, right. Josefina Moreno? I'm Mr. Villagran's lawyer. Can you come with me, please? You'll be treated as minor. Without being convicted you'll spend some time at a juvenile center. Keeping you there is my job. Not much different, but at least you'll be with other kids your age. Now, let us be clear. Christmas is around the corner and everything takes more time. I won't know anything until early next year. Is there no way to expedite the process? I'm afraid not, Josefina. But don't lose hope. That's the only thing that will keep you sane here. If I happen to know anything, I'll let you know immediately. Thank you, Mr. Guayo. I'll be waiting. I'll start the process as soon as possible. Yes, Mr. Villagran. Josefina, please go to Carlos' office. Around the desk there is a... a bag. Can you bring it? That coffee has a hint of chocolate. Exactly. Our coffee is competing in the capital. Next week. I'm sure that bag will do. But... I've never been to the capital. Don't worry, Josefina. I'll make sure everything works out well. Open the bag. Thank you, Mr. Villagran. You're welcome. But you should thank my wife. She was the one who picked the dress. This competition will change the plantation's future. Oh, my God. I should be the one worried, our coffee is the one that has to stand out. You'll do great, Josefina. I'm sure about that. No matter what. Alright, godmother, bless me. Everything will be fine. Don't worry, okay? Amen. Take care of her. You too, take care of yourself. - I love you. - Me too. Everything is so big! Yes. It's a land of giants. Thanks. -Which way? -Over here. Thanks. Josefina. Let's go. Thanks. Okay, I will see you early in the morning. If you need anything or if you have a question, call me at room 301. Alright? Get some rest. Are you okay? Yes. -Are you ready? -Yes. Let's go. It's getting late. Josefina. We won? Josefina. I'm Sofia Delgado. I work for the San Pedro Cooperative Mill from the Tespeque region. Our coffee is one of the best. We just got the first prize. Oh, yes. I want you to work for us. Here. This is my card. Ah, you see... I work for Mr. Villagran. I know. How much are they paying you? No matter how much, I promise you can make more with us. Thank you. Josefina. Call me. Dalia! I'm so sorry. Forgive me for being so stupid, so selfish. I'm so sorry. Come on, let's pray. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Our Father, Who art in heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
