Good morning, darlings. I'm Alpha one-nine and I'm here every day to disseminate the dirt, destroy the disinformation and hopefully, god willing, deliver a soupcon of hope. It is day 592 since the outbreak of covid-19 delta and you are listening the doomsday daily. I'm part of the small but fierce network of radio ops across this sad but so far undefeated country. I believe that we are defeated, but we are still here, so here's your news. I would have loved being at that meeting where the people in charge thought it would be a good idea to take the healthy folks and put them into the camps. 'Cause putting lots of people in camps, that's always worked out so well in the past, right? In Pennsylvania where the remaining isolation camp is located reports are clogging the frequencies verifying an infected person or a persons entered camp bastion. Almost all 20,000 people are dead. Rumors are someone's planning to napalm the area, well, I would love to know who got their hands on that kinda shit. What do we do here? Your fever's gone. That's impossible. How far are we? Less than a day. We could be there tomorrow morning if we push through all night. Sarah, what are you doing? Food, guy, we need food. Yeah, we'll find it. We haven't eaten since vesterday, we haven't slept. Come on, we can't sleep til we get to Ben's. Are you sure Ben will be there? When his dad died he went a little nuts, became something of a survivalist. He started stockpiling things, fortifying his land. As long as he didn't get sick, he'll be there. Over here. Slow down, sis. - I'm too hungry. - It has to hydrate. No, I'm too hungry. You promise Ben will take us in? He was my mentor at the bureau, one of the best FBI agents I've ever seen. He won't turn us away. He might when he finds out who I am. Listen, we had to run. At least there we would've been running from that nut job. T know. I know, I still can't figure out how he found out about you. It was that nurse, I'm telling you. She got all kinds of religious. Like some kind of fanatic. And he was her god. Do you see anything? She's gotta be here somewhere! What do we do? How does he keep finding us? It's been weeks. Run! Don't shoot her, we need her alive. You need to run. No, what about you? I have to protect you. No, I'm not gonna let you die. Yes, you are. You've known it was eventually gonna end this way. Stay off the roads. Don't stop until you get to Ben's. Get the girl! You know, I do feel sorry for those who tried to run camp bastion. I think it was the last place pretending to be civilization as if covid prime, I just made that up, wasn't bad enough, it just kept mutating, getting stronger each time. Things didn't get completely discombobulated until the great collapse due to the lack of healthy workers, which then caused the first of the nuke plants to melt down. Then no food, no supplies, and you know what that led to; Land pirates. Marauders acting all rapey and pillagey and the cities descending into chaos. Survival of the vicious. But I have a question. What do the land pirates do when they've plundered everything in the cities? They go into the country where people have stockpiles of stuff. And we all know what that means, right? We're back in the wild wild west. In the "what does it matter anyway?" Category, they're saying somebody at camp bastion survived. Like Lazarus going for a stroll, he just left death's door and he did not look back. Now, this is, of course, something we haven't seen before so you ask, "did he just walk out of the camp"? Why ves, yes he did. After killing a couple of the caretakers, and like any good Messiah, he got himself some followers and he's on a quest. What and where? No clue. The big brains at the world health organization said 1% of the infected could be asymptomatic. So batten down the hatches, dial up the paranoia, stranger danger, all that. Watch out for unknowing carriers and deranged messiahs. I'm not saying you might need to drop people you don't know, but you might just need to drop people that you don't know. Like I tell ya, darlings, keep your asses home, stockpile your food, make sure your guns are clean, take care of yourselves. With that, all right, I'm back tomorrow. Maybe. How much further? We're close. Do you think she could've gotten here already? On foot she could've gone straight across the land. She's either there or we'll be waiting for her. When we get her we're gonna protect her, right? What'd you think we'd do with her? We're gonna breed her, it feels kinda cruel to me. She's our hope, Owen. This is how we make sure this planet keeps going. But how many others are gonna be hunting for her too? Shut the hell up! We follow Aaron's plan without question. Without hesitation. He saw death and laughed at him. And death set him free. And now I'm the one who decides who lives and who dies. Me. I conquered this virus and every one of you I kept the virus away from you, I pulled you all out of the trash and made your lives whole. I gave it order. And I can make you un-whole just as fast. Death gave me the sight, but it is only the true believers who will reap the reward. I will make everything right again through this girl. Do any of you doubt me? You're the boss. Do any of you doubt me? Yes, I am the boss. And why is that? Because everyone is looking for this girl but only I was able to track her. And do you know why? Because he showed me where to go and he will show me what to do when she's in our hands. I'm starting to hear things. It's been too quiet out here, dad. Starting to lose my mind. Hey, Ben. Take a second. I ook how beautiful this is. How lucky are we? Yeah. Small enough that I can keep my eye on you and big enough that I don't have to see your ass every day. Hey, I'm the one who's supposed to keep an eye on you. I promised mom I'd protect you, not the other way around. It was a joke. You losing the ranch was never a joke to her. - Losing it? - Yeah. We ain't gonna lose shit. Your FBI pension is keeping us afloat until things turn around. You'll see. Things are never gonna turn around if you keep blowing through your money the way you do. Not now, Ben, please. Just enjoy nature. Have some fun for once. It's never gonna be a good time for you, is it? You just keep on running. Hey. Wake up. Ben Grant. Hey! What name did you just say? Ben Grant. Guy Hodges. Damn. Upstairs. Go, first step. Howdy. Name's Matthew. What can I do for ya? Well, you see, we've been living out of this thing for awhile now and we're running out of supplies. Any of you infected? No, no, we're all good. Can't help you. Can't spare anything. What'd you say your name was? I didn't. You should probably keep going. I've searched for miles, I found nothing. Are you Heath Grant's son? Don't I know you? I don't think so, but it wouldn't surprise me. Stop! What? All right. What do you want? Since we aren't armed, perhaps we could have a conversation without the gun? Nope! I know it's the end of the world but couldn't you show us some decency? I'll put mine down when she does. Ah, that's my friend Marley. You caught us. A little insurance always comes in handy, clearly you're a man who understands that. As I said, I'll put mine down when she does. Well, that's not gonna happen. So we're gonna have to make due. Now, listen, as my friend here mentioned, we're gonna be relieving you of some supplies, but more importantly I think you may have something that belongs to me. What would that be? That would be a girl about yay high, dark hair. Haven't seen her! Not exactly a time to be letting strangers into your home. No, but maybe we could have a look around, see if she's hiding on your property. Why's she so important to you? She's important to the future of mankind, but that's all you need to know about that. So, what do you say? Can we have a look around and we look and we don't find her we leave, no one gets hurt? Except a girl. If she's hiding out here somewhere. Look, I don't wanna kill anybody, but I'm done talking. You have 30 seconds to get off my property! That's a little abrupt. Go. By the way, the ranch looks great. Your father would be proud. Aaron! We'll find her. How do you know that guy? I know of him from a former life. His father was a gambler indebted to the organization I worked for. This is a sign. Because if death didn't have a plan for me and that girl then how did we end up here? You could taste the lies coming from him. She's there. I'm sure of it. And we're gonna make him pay for taking what's rightly ours. We do whatever has to be done. We turn around and go back. We'll find her. What do you think? What? What do you think? I think it's a lot of work. Well, if anyone can do it, it's you. Come on, Benny, it'll be worth it. How would it be worth it? You've been out there in the real world. Out there everyone is waiting to take something from ya. What happens if this virus thing gets bad like they're talking? They're saying manufacturing might even shut down. We have to protect the ranch, we have to protect what's ours. It's a huge piece of property. It would take weeks, no months. What else is there to do? All I'm asking is to beef up the fence, grab some more guns, I don't know, build some more security around here. Is this about those guys from the city? No, it's about us. T have work to do. We don't have a lot of time. We can't trust anybody. You sound like you're going crazy. This land is all we have, Ben. It's just you and me out here. I mean, how would you feel if you didn't do it and something happened to me? Oh, Jesus, dad, would you stop? Nothing's gonna happen to you. You're losing your fucking mind. What the hell happened? What do you mean? When a boy don't listen to his own father or a boy don't have respect for his own father? What am I supposed to respect? Am I suppose to respect how you gamble away all your money? Benny. Am I supposed to respect how mom used to sit up every night not knowing if or when you'd come home? If you were dead in a trash can? Stop, don't say another word. Okay, dad. You know, you tell me what I'm supposed to respect and I'll start respecting it. I gotta go to work. Here we go. Get back inside! Not a chance. Hands! I wanna see hands! I know you're lying. Where's the girl? We can talk about this! There's nothing to talk about. Providence brought us here. And I told you, I don't have any girl. I can hear the lie in your voice. Like father, like son. Fuck. We can barter! This isn't exactly a negotiation. It should be! Okay, you'd like to barter. Well, all right, may I go first? Ready? - Ready. Okay. You can a, give us the girl, all your supplies and let me burn your ranch to the ground. Or b, try and fight at which point we will kill you and take the girl anyway. And c? Uh, a and b are your only options. They're pretty limited. Now you hear me out. Okay. Think about the long run. If we fight we waste a whole lotta bullets and we both know they're a hot commodity around here. That they are. I'll trade you food and supplies in exchange for you leaving. We forget this happened and go our separate ways. Doesn't work for me. You see, I am duty bound to save the earth from this virus and I won't let anyone stop me. So now what's gonna happen is we're gonna take everything that you have and then we're gonna kill you anyway. Shit! Fuck! Oh, god, stop it! I will bitchslap you right through that wall. Your crying isn't helping anyone. Jackson is dead! Yes, he is dead, so grab a gun and kill the son of a bitch who did it. Where's your gun? Go ahead. Go! Stop. Stop firing. We're running out of ammo. Matthew, how much do we have? Close to out. So, what are gonna do? Well, we're not gonna keep doing this. Jeez, there are five of us, there's one of him. But he has ammo. Well, then we make him run out. Well how do we stop him from running back to the house and getting more? We shoot back. Not a lot, not more than one bullet at a time. Just keep him there. Until he runs out. - Exactly. - And when we run out? We deal with that when we get there. Just worry about keeping him pinned down. That's all we have to do. I hit him. Fuck! Fuck you, Heath. He's running out of ammo, and if he's hit we've got him just where we want him. At this rate we'll probably be here till night. Your point? By then we could probably go out and find supplies the- we're not here for the supplies. And if we leave and that idiot inside starts telling people that we ran and then everyone out there starts to think that we're weak. And I don't know about you, but I'm not a fan of being anyone's bitch. I'm not either: He didn't take you in. He didn't take any of you in because he thought you were weak. Are you weak? We're gonna take the girl and we're gonna kill the rancher and if any of you think that isn't what's gonna happen, 1 suggest you step outside the war wagon now and gamble on who shoots you first. Thought so. Oh shit. Come on. Come on, you fucker. - My leg. - Matthew, get something! Fuck! Hurry! Fuck! Breathe, Ben. Fucking breathe. Fuck. Fuck. You can do this. Just sit. Oh, fuck. I'm fine. Yeah, you look fine. I mean it. I'm sure you do. Let me fix you up anyway. Just rub some dirt in it. We both know that's bullshit. Oh, that's nice. I'm sorry, does it sting? Like hell. Good. It's what you get. No, not now, Ben. Actually, I can't think of a better time. All right. I et's hear it. How many times have I told you to stop? How many? How many? Too many. Too many. How many times have I asked you to add some more security around here? Why? Because of all the ass beatings you're taking? It's not that simple, Ben. But it is that simple. Ben. Dad. Dad. Look at me, look at me. I'm glad you're home and I'm glad you're safe. I gotta lock up outside. Rub some dirt in it. Asshole. I'm gonna need your help. Wake up! Hey! I need you to wake up! I need you to wake up. Shit. Come on, baby. Have you seen him? Nope. Great, so now he's out there somewhere with a ton of ammo. You're assuming he has ammo, you don't know that. Then we need a plan, we need to walk through our options. Now you're thinking. He's holed up in one of those buildings with nowhere to go. We could storm in there and pretend our guns are loaded. Any smart man would surrender right then. What happens if he shoots back? Why don't we sneak in there instead of storm in there? Don't you think he's watching us? John, he's smarter than that. So if we leave the war wagon we'll most likely be shot. Right, and if we stay in the war wagon we're gonna run outta supplies and starve or he's just gonna come down here and kill us. We wait until nightfall, we could sneak up to the house, storm in, take him by force. Or you just don't be chicken shits. What we need to do is just go in right now and shoot this fucker of mothers in the face. We tracked this girl for weeks. It was destiny that brought us here to start the world anew. With her blood she will breed and her children will be immune. And they will speak of us as the people who saved humanity. You're just being tested. You're being tested. Shit, I am being tested. And I have to ask you, are you ready to embrace your destiny or do you wanna be just another stain in this dying world? I was led to you and you saved me. I'm not turning back now. I'm not going anywhere. Let's show that asshole who he's dealing with. You're my family now. You know I would die for you. The greatest expression of love is death. Get back. Get us in there as far as you can and then we charge. What about the barricade? Fuck the barricade! Do it, Matthew! Jackson wouldn't of died for nothing! Fuck off. You're in my house. Who are you? Why did you come here? I'm guy's sister, Sarah, and I'm in your house because my brother told me that you would protect us. Well your brother is full of shit. You wanna know what I did at the FBI? Maps. I teach agents how to read maps. Who did you think I was? They found me. Come on! Don't let them take me. Put that away. Follow me, now. Go, go, go! Not you. Not on that leg. How much ammo you have left? Enough to kill him if I see him. Good. Marley. You're my right hand. My work is your work. Bring her back to me. Anything for you. They've broken through the barricades. Get into the basement. Stay quiet and lock the door. Do you see anything? No. He's here somewhere. Owen, Matthew, come with me. John, check that house. I saw on TV that virus is killing a lot of people. Lotta countries closing their borders. Yep. Another new reason for you not to go into the city, okay? I ain't seen a deer around here in weeks. Maybe it's a deer virus. Well, if we can't kill one for dinner maybe I'll go into town and buy one. I just told you you need to stop going into the city. I said town, just down the road to the market. It's a venison kinda night. If you insist, if that's the case, I'll drive. No, really, Ben, I owe you for patching me up the other night. Oh no, I insist. A little father-son bonding. We can bond here over dinner. You're in no shape to drive, Heath. Just let me go as a thank you. You know, I can't think of the last time you bought venison as a thank you. Usually we kill 'em ourselves. Well maybe if we sit here longer, try harder. We've sat here long enough already. Dad... I mean, we can't sit here all day. It'll be quicker... dad! Stop lying. Lie? Just trying to do something nice. Oh god, you're so full of shit it's coming out your fucking eyeballs. I'm telling the truth. The market doesn't sell venison, dad! I'm tired of this. I'm your son. I'm not your babysitter and I ain't your fucking sponsor. If you keep this up, you're gonna lose this place. If you lose this ranch, you lose everything. And not just our home, you lose everything grandma and grandpa ever worked for. I lose all my childhood memories, all my good memories with you and mom. You wanna talk about grandma and grandpa? Yes! Well let's talk about them, huh? Where were you when grandma died? And what about grandpa? Where were you, Ben? Fuck you. Don't tell me about loss, I sat here and watched my parents die. - I was working! I had a job! You knew I couldn't leave. Do you know why you knew? Because one of us had to be the grownup. Since when does growing up mean turning your back on your family? Turning my back on my family? My family? Where were you when mom died? - I was- - You were fucking gambling! You were gambling! It's not the same. Of course it's not the same because you have a disease. I'd never turn my back on you. If I did, I wouldn't be here. You wanna do this to yourself? Then you just go right ahead. I can't do it anymore. If I do, I'm gonna have a heart attack just like mom. I'm done wasting my energy trying to stop you. It's up to you, Heath. I'll do the barns, check the deer blind. Shoot that bastard. You're fucking dead. No sign of him or the girl. Was that just sitting up there? Yeah, there's another one up there. Based on what I've seen I wouldn't be shocked if there's weapons hidden all over this place. Go sit in the blind, you see him, you start firing. We'll come running. And you? I'm gonna take a walk in the woods and see what I can find. All right. Good luck. You, too. You can come out now. You did that? Why do they want you? They think I can somehow save them. Their leader, he... He wants to breed me. I gotta put some lights on outside. It's gonna be dark soon. It's gonna be a long night. You know, I don't think you're lying to me, but you're definitely not telling me everything. Think about how that helps us. I know your footsteps. In a pride of lions the female does most, if not all the hunting. Do know how a male lion hunts? No. Okay, I'll tell ya. He sits on his ass in the brush and he waits for the prey to come to him. I am the male lion. I am the king of the jungle. I just wanted to check on you. I'll go. You need to get this done, it's taking too long. I know it's a big ranch, but he's out there, Marley, and so is she. He knows where to hide. There are four of you and one of him. You disappoint me. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry, that's for the weak. You're not weak. You go out there and do what you have to do, get it done. Make me proud. T will. No, no, no, no. Shit. Ben. What? T have the virus. What? They don't know. No. They think I'm immune, but I'm not. I'm a carrier, 1 just don't get sick. The refugee camp in Pennsylvania. That was you. That was me. All those people. I didn't know what I was. I showed up and everyone started getting sick. They were all dying except for me. The doctors couldn't tell people that they messed up by letting me in, so they hid it. They told everyone I was immune and everyone believed it. They threw me in a quarantine cell and said that they were gonna send me off to some research place. But I've heard stories. You don't know what they do to people like me. They experiment, it's like being a fucking rat in a cage waiting to be dissected. Was your brother guy a carrier? He was sick and helped me escape. Neither one of us knew how long he would make it. Am I sick? It don't know. T'll see who it is. Ben... go on. Go on. All right. What do you want? What we always want. You shouldn't of come here. Heath, we came to collect. I just need more time. You've had more than enough. Just a little more, I'm so close. Close? Is that a joke? Close? Hear that? You owe us more money every time you set foot outside that house. - I understand, but- - Do you have it? Well then why don't we see if there's anything more valuable inside? Not in the house! What are you doing, Heath? Get out of my way. Hey! Dad! Hey! Hey! Don't come back! It's not your fault. It's nobody's fault. It's just the way it is. Hide. Now. Where are you? I got you. Come on. I know she's here! 14 people are dead, including three children. Four others suffered serious injuries. Police have a suspect in custody but are not releasing any information until they complete their investigation. Health officials from around the world met virtually today seeking to unite all their resources as the worldwide death toll now tops eight... To suppress the mass looting the president sought to order martial law in effect, but with more than 2/3rds of the country's military and law enforcement officers sick... Good evening, darlings. This is the new doomsday daily and I'm still learning how to operate this radio along with catching all the relays across the country, so I'm coming to you from somewhere in the heartland. So if you can hear me, I just might be able to see you. It's been a brutal 24 hours, so let's forego the witty alliterative banter. The president has died. There's just no more government. He was the last. There is no longer anybody running this country. I'm not sure what else to report as we're all just figuring this out, but I'm just gonna keep coming back for as long as I can. This is Alpha one-nine. You know what? This is Jessica. Goodnight, darlings. You're never gonna get that girl. You're never gonna get my land. You come to my house, you try to kidnap this girl, and then you try to kill me? Just wanted the girl! No. No, wait, wait! Wait! No, no, no, don't. No. Oh no, no, no. Don't do this. It don't have a choice. Yes, you do. She's not immune. The girl is sick. Hell, at this point, so am I. I have to kill you or Aaron kills me. You can run, you can head into those woods and don't you ever look back. It's too late for that. We're gonna go for a walk. You try anything, you try to run, I swear by sweet and sainty Jesus I'll put a bullet in your head. Get up! Come on! Movel Oh, my god. Well, look at us. Let's be done with this. No, we have to talk before we're finished. We have nothing else to say. You're gonna toss that gun aside, I'm gonna give you your lady back, you're gonna get into that truck and you're gonna ride off into the sunset. Ah, happily ever after? - That's the idea. - Uh huh. Well, let's think through that. So, I toss my gun, you let her go, and how do you think that would end? I mean, two people who've been trying to kill you all day long standing in front of you defenseless, we'd be dead in seconds. It see how that looks. I'll throw my gun as soon as you do. You have my word. Your word doesn't mean anything to me because I've been ordained by the other world to kill anyone who stands in my way. It don't want this! I'm not a killer! I think today you earned that moniker. And now you're standing with a gun to Marley's head and you expect me just to walk away? Yeah, I guess I do. Yeah, I guess you can see that's not gonna happen. I didn't ask you to come here! Doesn't matter now, son. Look around youl! I've already won! Toss your gun, cut your losses, and go home! Stop! Just out of common courtesy, do you mind taking off her gag? I think she has some wisdom to impart. Fuck you. Hey, Marley, how's it going? I have had better days. Boys, I think we're at a stalemate here. And the only thing killing anyone is old age. The only prize is still hiding somewhere on this land! See, we've been after her ever since she left the camp. It was always about the girl. But you're wrong about the girl! Nol she's immune and Aaron sees the big picture. He knows that she could change everything. But she's not immune! That's a lie they told you at the camp. She's a carrier and she will infect you both! You're a liar. You expect us to believe that? Well, you better believe it! Because right now I'm breathing all over your lady's face. And if I'm sick, then she is too. I can smell your lies. I walked straight through that disease, son, and came out alive. The girl is my right, she is my destiny. But your destiny is gonna get you killed. She is mine and I'm taking her. Don't do it. Aaron. I've told you time and again that I would do whatever it took to end this and get her back. You did. And I have kept my promise until now, haven't I? You have. Then you do what you need to do. T will. Fuck. Come on, come on, come on. I had this thought that when I go it would be the virus that took me down, not some dumb-ass with a gun. Sorry to break it to you, this isn't how it ends. You're gonna have to live with what you've done. What I've done? I beat death again! I'm invincible! He killed guy. He would've done this again. I couldn't let him do this to another person. I'm so sorry, Ben. I'm sorry this happened to you. Don't apologize ever. Are you okay? I've been better. I always figured if the world ended we'd band together and help each other and... I don't know what to do now. I don't have anyone. Yeah, me too. We do have one thing going for us. Yeah? What's that? An armored truck with a tank full of gas. Yeah. It's time I leave this place. Maybe someone out there's working on a cure. You'll need help if you're sick. Are you coming with me? You shouldn't go out there on your own. You got any supplies we can take? Yeah. We'll be fine.
