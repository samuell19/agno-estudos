Start your families at a young age! Be grandparents as soon as possible! If you start young, three generations can celebrate the holidays together! Don’t forget, life only lasts eighteen thousand days! Don’t you want to watch your grandchildren grow up? Information about our doctors' schedules can be found on the panels. - See you next Wednesday! - Thank you. - See you. - Bye! It happened, doc. How do you feel? I’ve been thinking about what they are doing with him all day. Did you go to his farewell party? No. Fuck, you know how much he meant to me, but I couldn’t pull myself together. Trust me, your uncle was totally prepared to go. What’s the point of it all? Fifty meaningless years, locked up in here? Zoltan, please take a seat. I'd rather live outside the Dome. You would die out there in a few days. Your uncle’s sacrifice... ...is a gift. For you, for me. For all of us to live. The day will come when we too will make this sacrifice, because it is our duty to do so. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to look at food again. Trust me, you will. Thank you for opting for the Voluntary Implantation! Your body is invaluable to our community. Please place your palm in the light indicated slot! Tomorrow, our staff will locate you using the tracking bracelet. Make the most of your last hours. - Could you sleep? - Uh-huh. Good, I’m happy for you. Mmm! This is amazing! How was your day? I got up and... Did you go for a walk? Uh-huh. Good! That’s good! Walking is very important. Could be. Nora! Nora! Tell me it isn’t true! Nora! But I thought... ...we were just getting back to normal. Nora!? We’d started over! You started over. I can’t believe this! This isn’t happening to us! I can’t look in the mirror anymore. Or at the windows. I don’t see my face anymore, I only see his. It didn’t hurt. Really, it didn’t. It only took a second. I’ve come for a name! Not even a hello? I need a name! - You look like shit, bro! - I need that name from the Plantation! What are you talking about? Are you mad? I... I didn’t even notice anything. I’ve even been watching her in her sleep! She’s been taking walks for two weeks now! What are you talking about? Nora’s had the Voluntary Implantation! How could you be so stupid? I can't let her do that! - It... it isn’t her fault! - When did she get the implantation? Yesterday. Around noon. Then, they will be coming for her at dawn. - No, no! I won’t let it happen! - You know how it is! I won’t! I’m going to have it reversed! Stefan. Stefan. She's been implanted. The Seed is in her. She’s going to transform! No, she is not! - Dumb fuck! - What?! Dumb fuck! You come here crying to me? You’re a shrink and you don’t know what’s going on with your own wife? Everyone sacrifices themselves here. Isn’t that what you preach all day? You once told me about someone who'd heard of a procedure! I never said that! Who said that the Seed could be surgically removed! I was probably high and talking shit! There was a time when you came to talk to me. Remember?! I must talk to that person! That’s impossible. Why? Because Madu still works on the Plantation. I’ll also volunteer for the Implantation! They’ll implant me, take me away and then I’ll look for Nora! Yeah, right, they’ll sedate you and you’ll never wake up again. If it’s any comfort to you, Nora won’t feel or see anything either. It doesn’t comfort me one bit! Then, what are we waiting for? The whole thing is just a big mistake, a misunderstanding. I love her. So, we’re off to see the Captain then. Let’s go to the ship! VIRTUAL CRUISES Guys, it’s too early for this. Are you insane? I thought, you just wanted a simple “Kludge”! You don’t think I’d drag you out of bed for something so petty? A “Kludge”? He’ll forge your birth data in the system. You’ll live an extra year. In this city, everyone wants to postpone being sent out to the Plantation. - Why are you in such a hurry? - His wife just volunteered. Jeez. “All day long I weep for your body, lovesick lover’s tears for his bonny.” Is that how it is? Can you do it or not? The real question is more like can you handle it? Relax, he’s a smart guy. He can do it! Listen Captain! I don’t have much time! I’ll get Nora back by this afternoon. You’ll get our data sorted by tonight. You won’t even remember me by tomorrow. Of course I will! If you’re as clever as you are determined, this’ll be the highlight of my career! Now, let me get to work! Do you have anything personal on you? You can’t take anything to the Plantation with you. This might work. Listen here! Just say that you want to get the interviews done ASAP, got it? Call Madu in first! Are you listening to me? Yes, of course. Anything you want me to tell her? No. Whatever you see there, don’t be alarmed! They think you know about everything. And try to stay on Central Island, okay? OK! I’ll be fine. Alright! I’ve just sent the Plantation a nice little on-the-spot assessment! From now on, you are the city’s supervising psychiatrist. Just act like one from here on out! Thank you. Hey, if you do come back in the form of something other than food, then come over and tell me all about it! I can hardly get anything out of your brother! D'you know what they do with guys like you over there? Turn them into a Bonsai! The passengers are waking up. Now beat it! Bon voyage! Thanks for everything. You guys come back. Okay? We bid farewell and express our gratitude here at Hologram Park to the 97 fellow humans who are leaving us today for the sake of our survival. Marton Balazs, Dorina Bercsenyi, Klara Markovics-Hajdu, Marcell Jager, Nora Kallay, Attila Kornilov... Please, don’t blink! Alright! Follow me to the vehicle! DANUBE GATE Arrival to the Plantation in 5 minutes. These veins are beautiful! Although... I do see a few smaller knots here. Perhaps I should stand up and turn around, Doctor Kovacs? Pardon? I suppose you’d like to examine me front and back. Never seen a fat person before, have you? As a matter of fact, I haven’t. - Let’s wait for the next clearing! - Yes, sir! We weren't expecting an assessment. Uh... I was sent by HQ to begin the staff's psychological evaluations earlier. And why is that? Hmm. Life has become crazy up there, lately. The assessment deadlines have been moved up. You know how it is! So, if you don’t mind Director, I’d like to begin the interviews immediately. Don’t you want to inspect the grounds? I’d be happy to show you around! I’d rather not take up any more of your time. Aren't you the least bit curious? Yes, of course. But I must send in my-- How do you want to understand these people if you don’t see with your own eyes what their work consists of? Please turn that hybrid around! Oh my god! Externus Radix! A rare and remarkably aggressive mutation. There are abnormal root formations from within the veins. There’s nothing more infuriating than a wasted subject. Doctor! Doctor! Doctor Kovacs! Yes? If possible, I would like to begin the interviews now. These are just bodies, Doctor. These aren’t human beings, only bodies. Come on! We’ll calm down a bit in the forest. We have 130 islands. These are from the 10th to 16th cycle. The 4th stage! My favorite! Can you feel it? Fresh oxygen! They were over the moon when they found out the Earth had thousands of years worth of oxygen resources without any plant life! Oh my... But this air is different! We used to regularly deliver some to Hologram Park. For the real forest experience! Ah, but it was too much of a hassle, so they called it off. Hold it up towards the light! What do you see? Fingerprints? Well, isn’t it wonderful? Now, eat it! - Pardon me? - Well, go ahead now! So, what do you think? Everyone in the city is talking about sacrifices being made and here you are gagging like some child! Don’t you dare spit it out! My apologies. So, now tell me what you think? It’s bitter. We dry, jellify, flavor, color, and package them, so that it isn’t unpleasant for anyone. That was a man. Can you feel a numbing sensation on the right side of your tongue? If it had been a woman, you’d feel it right here. He was a brown haired, green-eyed. Introvert. Tolerated stress well. Conformist. Sarcastic. Composed. Cautious. HYBRID Don’t be fooled by their beauty. These trees are just about three years old. Their scarlet leaves indicate that it’s almost the blossoming period, when they begin to produce poisonous pollen. A single one of these trees could wipe Budapest out. What do you think this is? Mother Nature’s sense of humor or her revenge? My people are going to talk to you at length about this. HEALTH CENTER Doctor Madu! Come in! - Good afternoon! - Good afternoon! I hope your questions will be more entertaining than your predecessors’. Please have a seat! You couldn’t have found a better time to set me back in my work! I’ll only hold you up as long as absolutely necessary. Could you please tell me what your exact field of specialty is? Plant pathology. If I am right, your official contract expired five years ago and that you were sent back to the city. I went back home for two weeks, and that was more than enough. Why did you want to come back here? - You would think that... - I can't finish anywhere else. I cannot finish anywhere else. You will be turning 50 in four months. You mean... ...you’d like to finish here? At least I’ll be saving myself a trip. Look! You really are wasting my time! Your contract requires you to attend at least one interview per year. Since your return to the Plantation, you haven’t taken part in a private or group therapy session. Not a single psychiatrist can grant me any more time. Why do you want more time? Don’t you? Why would I? Everyone wants more time. What is your relationship like with the others here? We tolerate one another. Have you ever gotten close to anyone here at the Plantation? With Mark Kovacs, for example? Pardon me? Mark Kovacs. He was a security officer. You worked here together for years. Both of your contracts expired on the same day. Would you be so kind as to disclose what kind of relationship you had with him? Official or professional? No other types exist here on the Plantation! - Help me, please! - Fuck, what do you want from me? My wife! She was transported here today! She is 32. You have to help me! Is this some idiotic new test? Are you fucking with me?! I’m Mark’s younger brother! He sent me here! On average, we have 700 voluntary implantations every year. You are the first relative ever to come here. Let go, keep a distance, and rationalize the situation. Who would know that better than a psychiatrist? Go on home and grieve your own wife’s selfishness. Her what? You said she was 32, so she threw away 18 years. How dare you speak about her like that?! I would give my right arm for eighteen more days! You know nothing about my wife! All I know is that she volunteered. Has what is going on here made you so indifferent? You have no idea why I came back! Mark didn’t fool me. I know the plant can be surgically removed! Yes, it can! But not here! What did you just say?! You came here in vain! We don’t have the proper apparatus here. On the Granum. She can only be operated on there. What? On the Granum? On the outside? Yes, in the Tatra Mountains. Good! If I could get in here, then I can get out there! Now, if you’ll just tell me what island she’s on! Give me some time. Now, go back and continue the interviews! We’ll meet back here after. I liked those as a kid too. It was my son’s. You recognize him, don’t you? - What’s that supposed to mean? - Do you know who he is? Janos Paulik, The Seed’s innovator. Primary school material. Paulik taught me plant genetics at university. He went back to the Granum when I was in my third year. He’s been working there ever since. Come on now! He must be long past 50! He must've been implanted decades ago! The city isn’t foolish enough to kill off the one person who saved it! Paulik always hammered into us that the most important thing is for humanity to survive. Whatever the cost! What if that can be achieved with less sacrifice? I loved your brother, believe me. But I couldn’t even tell him why I had to come back here. Holy shit, what is that? A partial implantation. Nobody knows about it. This kind of experiment isn't authorized. I’m not completely self-sustainable, but I am close! You haven’t transformed? But how? How’s that possible? So far, I’ve been able to control the spreading and avoid becoming poisonous. Then you could stop the process from occurring in Nora?! No. The Seed was implanted into her heart and not in the arm as in my case. So, what do I do now? Listen! We’ll get out of here. I’ll take you to the Granum. What are you talking about? I could continue my work on the Granum once I’ve turned 50. Paulik would recognize the importance of my research, and I could get him to operate on your wife! At least be happy a little! I just don’t get why you want to help us after all? For one, I have a heart of gold. Two, we have a much better chance of getting to the Granum together. And I wouldn’t be able to find another lunatic to volunteer for the journey. Stefan! Concentrate! DISCONNECTED I am going to take out the infusion tubes now, you have to hold the subject! We must dry the surface of the body off as soon as possible! The plant is already developing, and water accelerates the transformation. As does strong sunlight. Everything will be alright. Everything is going to be alright now! She must be operated on within the next five days. We can cover a few hundred kilometers in no time, right? Maximum two days. Two days? We need to get there much faster! Finally! The subject is reacting well. Nora. Her name is Nora. Is it really going to take two days to get there? It depends on the weather. Did you think this was going to be a joyride? So then, will you tell me what your plan is? There are a few emergency exits in the wall. We’ll use one of them to go up to the surface. We have to get to Miskolc with this car. From there, it will be a piece of cake. Ok. Let’s say that Paulik hasn’t been implanted yet. You still don’t know if he’s still alive. Can we discuss this later?! We’re talking about an old man here! He must be in his eighties by now. He’s still alive! He recently requested some hybrids from the Plantation! Doctor Madu! Doctor Madu! This is security! Roger. This is Doctor Madu. A hybrid has been removed from island number 12 with your code. Can you confirm this? Confirmed. I needed a young subject. I do not see your request for this in the register. This is against the rules! I’ll make up for that today! Could you tell me why you are not taking the hybrid to the research island? I still need some samples from Island 43. Clearing is in progress on 43. I meant 42. I’ll check into that immediately. Over and out. Are we in trouble? They’ll chew on that for a while. How’s Nora’s pulse? Seems good. As soon as we get out of range, we’ll stop and I’ll examine her more thoroughly. She can only have minimal water on the road. Only a few sips every hour. Fuck! Are you hurt? It's alright! Hold on! Damn it! Madu, are you alright? God damn it! We have to stop the bleeding! Wait! Promise me that you’ll keep an eye on my research! Take it to the Granum! It’s not just Nora you need to save now! Don’t speak like that! We won’t be able to get there without you! The map is on there and so is the research. Give it to the Professor! Doctor Madu, don’t do this! He’ll help and perform the surgery! Okay, I’ll have a look at it later. Let me help you now! Madu! Doctor Madu! Look! It’s beautiful. Please! Madu! Shut up already! You can’t die here! Look, this is what a sunset looks like out here. Please! Show it to Nora too. You aren’t here! I came to get you. You... you stayed back home. Please take it easy, just rest! But you stayed back home! Lie back down. You need a bit more time to gain your strength back! I can’t breathe! - I can’t breathe! - Nora! Calm down! You need to rest, do you hear me? Nora! I’ve already died! You are not here! Nora! Stop! Don’t run off! - I’ve already died! - Nora! Nora! Nora! I went through with it! I know I did! - You aren’t here! - Calm down! Calm down! It hurts so bad! - It’s almost over! It’s almost over! - Take it off! Take it off! Get it off of me! Okay, okay! Calm down! Relax! Let me wipe your forehead! We have to go! I’m thirsty. You should eat something too. I’m not hungry. Give me some more water! Water speeds up the transformation. Do you want to watch it happen? I want to be by your side as long as I can. Then let's get it over with! Give me some more water! There isn’t enough. We'll surely find a place tomorrow where there’ll be clean water and you can drink as much as you like. What will become of you? We’ll see our last days together. Alright then! Come on! Let’s go! You can have another drink in two hours. Come on! PHEASANT STREET I imagined that it would be colder! Stefan, did you see that? It’s the Budapest logo! What’s that doing here? Look, there’s another one! Then, it has to be here somewhere! It has to be here somewhere! What does? We found it! Madu was right! Come on! We can go on! Nora! We can go on! Where to? If this works, we’ll be there in a matter of hours! There’ll be plenty of time for your surgery! What are you talking about? The Granum! They can remove the plant from you there! You’ll be saved! You’ll survive! It works! Come on! Nora! We can get going! I’m not going anywhere. Don’t say that! We won’t get another chance! I don’t care! I don’t want this! You didn’t even ask me! Can you grasp that?! What were you even thinking anyhow? - Nora, if we leave now-- - By any means! Do you even know what you forced me into?! What have you done? You could have had another family. Between the two of us, I’m the only one past 30. What does that have to do with anything? You’re 28. They certainly would have authorized you to have another child. You could have found somebody else who had more time. When we took Tomi to the hospital, you told me to calm down. In the next three weeks, every time I asked you what was going to happen, - You always said-- - I’m so sorry. - You always said he’d get better. - I’m so very sorry! Although we knew. We both did. Nora! You actually thought... If you had just disappeared... I’d be able to move on just like that? With someone else? I only have one family! Shall we go for a walk? What is this? Some crime movie? We missed the beginning! Not at all, it just started! Look, we’re on the Budapest metro. There’s a huge crowd, people are shouting, they must be coming home from a football match or something. A girl gets on at Blaha station and sits down in front of a boy, who happens to be reading an old book, the kind that still has paper pages. Can you see the cover? I can’t read the title. Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne. The boy senses the girl’s fragrance. He steals a look. - And then, another. - Why, what’s the girl like? She’s dressed in a horribly boring dress, isn’t she? Hmm. Yes, she is. She's reading sheet music. She doesn't even look at him. She may not even be interested in him. Of course, she is! She looks up at the boy. He catches a glimpse of her eyes. They are unbelievably green. They are beautiful. And then? And then the boy closes his book, and they just look at one another. We may need these. It’ll be cold tonight. Why are you so sure that they won’t turn us in the minute we get there? Trust me, if we take this to Paulik, we’ll be able to ask him for anything. Alright! Let’s say they perform the surgery. Then what? He might even be able to arrange for us to get back to the city. We can get going once the storm is over! I don’t know. Let’s just give it a shot! That’s all I ask. I trust there won’t be any more stops until the sea? If your wish is for there not to be, then we won’t be stopping anywhere else. Would you escort me? I would be obliged if you could show me the sea. With pleasure! May I sit by your side? I was hoping you would. Travelling with you will be wonderful. I wish Tomi could have seen all this. He loved watching the rays of lightning, amplified on the Dome. He was just afraid of the thunder. We used to always sing to him then, remember? But I was always off key. Nora! SYSTEM ERROR Where are we? I don’t know. We’re slowing down. Can you feel that? I’m scared. Hello!? Anybody there!? Hello!? Is there anybody here? Hello!? I don’t understand. She said that there'd be experiments! There would be people! Hello!? Stefan, there’s no one here. It’s impossible, this can’t be! Hello! Hello!? Hello!? Professor Paulik? Are you the Professor? Is that you? Is that an overall from the Plantation? Doctor Madu sent us here from the Plantation. I thought more people would be working here. It’s just the three of us. These two trees and me. Those branches look like they are burning! Of course. It is an indispensable part of the experiment to treat the subjects with high heat from time to time. - But that hurts them! - How would you know that? Did you come to inspect the hybrids which I requested? You’ve made an unnecessary trip. There is still some time before I have any results to show. Or isn’t that why you came? We’d like to ask for your help! It's like there’s something under the bark! Please do not touch it! That's a very special experimental subject! It’s not an experiment! It’s not a special subject. Is this woman... - Has she been implanted? - Yes. But it’s a mistake! That’s precisely why we are here! What is this? Some special experimental subject from Madu? Look, I don’t have the capacity to grant any extra requests! Professor! Let me explain. I am Stefan Kovacs. This is my wife Nora Kallay. Dr. Madu said that the implantation could be surgically reversed here! Please understand that we cannot lose one another! Dr. Madu helped us escape from the Plantation and sent this in exchange. She said you had to... It's approaching the left hemisphere. Here. See that? But it hasn’t reached the speech center yet, so... ...we still have plenty of time. - I’m ready for the surgery! - I’m afraid it’s impossible. The current supply in the building is at minimal level. It is inadequate for surgery procedures, so I'll reset the system right away. But, isn’t there a generator of some kind here? No. Unfortunately, there isn’t, but we have plenty of time for everything! Luckily, you haven’t been implanted! Otherwise, we'd all be in trouble! I hope you’ll join me for dinner later. He tortures them. What are you talking about? He tortures the trees every day. I don’t trust him somehow. Whatever, it doesn’t matter. Listen! We’ll leave here right after the surgery. What if there are other cities? We already travelled so far and didn’t see anybody. There must be other cities. With other laws. We could even have another child there. I never saw trees this big on the Plantation! A special plant food. They’re beautiful, aren’t they? You brought this in vain. It’s an interesting experiment, but... I don’t think they are ready for this in Budapest! Why not? You travelled through Miskolc, didn’t you? You may have seen some strange things there. - We saw an unfinished dome. - Uh-huh. Burnt homes. Charred trees in the houses. Certain events did not get into the history books. What do you mean? I’ve prepared a special dish. A long-extinct marine species. It’s called herring. Bon appetite! By the time I had turned 30, this planet was already dead. Only two cities remained in the region, Budapest had enough food supplies, but Miskolc was in its last phase. So, we rationed a Seed to every family and let them decide who they implanted, and who they ate. Did you honestly think a family would be able to do that? Well, we were that naive! Of course, no one chose their own families. Kidnapping offenses increased and they were abducting children too. - And what did the government do? - Nothing. But that was the smaller problem. When the trees began to blossom, it turned out that their pollen was poisonous. We did everything we could, but we couldn’t do anything about that. By the time food supplies in Budapest were depleted, we already had a new system. Strict laws. And they still even work today! Perhaps you don't like it? And what happened to the people in Miskolc? The blossoming trees poisoned them all. And what happened to the trees? We sent military units to set fire to them all. You killed thousands of trees! What difference does it make?! The system in Budapest works perfectly. How old are you Professor? 87. Then you should have been dead for 37 years in your perfect system! Nora! And, you could have lived for how many more years? I think it would be better for all of us to calm down a bit, and we should go back to our room. She threw everything away! She didn’t throw anything away. You are playing with your lives which you can both thank me for! We are not playing at all! You have no idea what true suffering is at all! I treat several hundred kids. I try to prepare them for their upcoming losses every day. It’s like getting ready for some chess game, who steps where and in how many moves and then you dare tell us we don’t know what suffering is?! You come here and hold me accountable!? And, in the meantime, you want me to fix your “little mistake"?! And what about your mistake? What’s the deal with Emma? Emma? Yes, Emma. I think it would be best if you went back to your room to rest after all. And what about the surgery? I’ll do it tomorrow. Did you have a bad dream? Yes. I don’t know. I don’t know. I can’t remember his name! He was afraid of storms. Somebody was afraid of storms. You’re talking about Tomi. You’re thinking about our son. Try to rest! Go back to sleep. Nora... Nora... They are complaining about me, aren’t they? Nora. Interpret for me! I would like to explain why I do this to them. I know that you can already communicate with them! They just want to know why you’re so cruel. I get up every two hours due to their new flower buds as it would be disastrous if I didn’t. They try to grow most of them at night. Let them blossom! That cannot happen! Then, they ask to be killed. Just make up your mind already! Kill my own daughter? No, no! That’s Peter’s wish! Emma doesn’t pose any danger on her own... Nora! If I kill one of them, the other would follow in a week’s time. Look! They still love each other like before. Yes, they do. Are you doing that? I have to help them! Stop that! They’ve been pleading for my help since we got here! Nora, don’t interfere! I just want you to interpret! Nora! You need to rest before the surgery! What are you doing here? Stefan, let me introduce Emma and Peter to you! Please come back to our room! Emma is the Professor’s daughter. Peter is Emma’s husband. Professor! This is just some hallucination, right? No, it isn’t! The closer the plant progresses to the speech center, the more she can communicate with Emma and Peter and the less with us. This was really your daughter? She still is my daughter! He had them brought here from the Plantation. I begged them. They could have received special permission on my account! But my daughter said, “No Papa, that’s the right thing to do.” “This is everyone’s fate!” They could have lived here with me as humans. For much longer than fifty years! They want to blossom! Don’t burn their flower buds! When I brought them here, for months after the implantation, I could still see their faces. I can feel that we are stronger together! Stefan, can’t you? Why don’t you let them blossom? It would be a tragedy if the flowers became fertilized! The offspring is already poisonous in the germinal stage! Look! Your wife has a catalyst effect on them! Tell her to get down immediately! But... Why can’t they reproduce here far away from humans? Because they only need water and sunlight! By the time we realize it, a poisonous forest would cover everything! And sooner or later, they’d kill the city that I have created! - You created? - Take this! And do what you need to do! Don’t ask me to do that! I saved humanity! Neither my daughter nor your wife is going to ruin that! A new evolution could start here! Only that we have no place in it! Don’t you get it already? Everything the human species has created would disappear! Science, culture, and civilization! I could only save a handful of all of these, as it is! Stefan! Think about the people! The children who you treat! Listen here! If you bring Nora down, we can begin the surgery. Right now! I do have a few backup generators in the surgery room! But, you said there weren’t any. I lied. I needed Nora. You’re playing with my wife’s life! I swear I’ll perform the surgery but first, we must burn all of these flower buds first! Idiot! Nora! Nora! They forgive you. What? Emma says... She will always remember when... When? - When what? - When you used to draw together, when she was a little girl. Yes... I remember. And what else does she say? I’m sorry. They aren’t answering anymore.
