Hi. Brother Benny sent me… Sit down. My name's Max. I'm Jackson. Benny sure is a lucky bastard. Where did he find you? What do you mean? I don't understand. It was a compliment, don't you get it? Thank you for choosing me for the threesome. Just tell me what to do and I'll do it. Don't be nervous. This guy comes very quickly. Let's go. You look good. Really? But it's too expensive. Don't worry, let's go. Here I laugh, here I cry. Here I live, and here I'll die. Here I pray and here I feel lost. Here I seek, and here I miss. Beijing, Beijing almost the distance between the neon lights and the moon. In the midst of their struggles, people comfort and hug each other. Searching and chasing, grasping at shattered dreams. Here we laugh, here we cry. Here we live, and here we'll die. Here we pray. Here we feel lost. Here we seek, and here we miss. Beijing, Beijing. It was great. You're not going to come? I have a client later. I can't let him down. Big Brother. Cheers. How are you tonight? Okay. That's good. Come outside. Big Brother, I'm sorry. Brother Bao, I'll be right back. Brother Bao, he's a very good friend, I'm sure it's urgent. What about me? Brother Bao, don't be angry, I'll come back and drink three glasses, okay? Okay, go, and then three glasses. Thank you, Brother Bao. Let's beat it, this guy's a psycho. Don't interfere, okay? Listen to me, I've seen plenty of guys like this. You can earn money any way you like, but I can't. I can't let my mom down. I know you take care of your family, but please think about your situation. Do you know what kind of guy he is? Are you finished? I got you breakfast. I shouldn't have treated you like that yesterday. Brother Bao! Where are you? I'm here… Brother Bao! Brother Bao! Brother Bao! Where are you? There he is! Brother Bao! Motherfucker! Xiaolai on the fifth floor. The young man's okay. What happened? FIVE YEARS LATER IN ANOTHER CITY How are things at home? Not bad, except Grandfather has gotten worse since his stroke. Thanks for everything you do. If I can help in any way, you must let me know. Don't worry, we can take care of him. By the way, when you get a chance, give Dad a call. Tell him he shouldn't drink so much. Though he never says it, I know he misses you. You haven't been back since Mom passed away... I know. I'm coming soon. Babe, does it feel good? You didn't come. You're the star of the show. As long as you're happy, I'm happy. But that's not okay. Even friends need rules, right? Got it. I'm off. Bye. Brother. This guy's really something. Treating you like an innocent girl. If you think he's so great, I can introduce him to you. Why not someone a little more generous? If you're looking for someone more generous, go ask your Xiangdong. Why would I bother him? He's already switched sides. By the way, how much money are you gifting Xiangdong and Lulu for their wedding? Why should I gift them money? It's a fake wedding. They already have the wedding certificate. We're the ones pretending for them, they should be gifting us money. Just pretend it's for Lulu's efforts. She is playing a fake wife by choice. Is it just for the money? Aren't you done being angry? Why should I be? I'm just afraid your generosity will bankrupt you. Well, we can't go empty-handed. Let's recycle this. Xiangdong, Lulu and we are very special friends. But for you, this arduous journey wasn't easy either, was it? - So let's drink another toast. - No, no need, thank you. You're all taking good care of Xiangdong. He talks about you guys all the time when he's back home. So it's not necessary, you're welcome. - Come. - Sit down. Sit down. The bride and the groom didn't toast with us. So here I come. Let's drink. Don't drink so much. Congratulations, and... As your friend, I've witnessed your love marathon. It was never easy, not easy at all. Sister Lulu, are you okay? Cheers! - Not so much. - It's fine. Xiangdong, this one's for you. From now on, treat her well. Lulu's my dream lover, if you let her down, I'll kick your ass. Such a happy day, the bridal couple needs to toast each other, right? - Xiangdong, Lulu, drink together. - Yeah! Not even a toast yet! Come on, drink! Okay, after the first toast comes the second. Haven't you had enough? What? No way! They didn't even kiss on their wedding day. Shouldn't they kiss at least once? Right? Kiss at least once! Kiss, kiss, kiss... Can you finally give it a rest? Stop it! Xiangdong did it right. He quit after earning enough money. He finds a fake marriage to keep his family satisfied. With your beauty, you could too. You just need to try harder. I'm far from that. Sometimes it's just fate. I went to dinner with Lulu the other day and saw a street singer. She said he was once the most successful money boy in Changsha. Fate has hit him hard. What's up with him? He fought for someone and wound up crippled. And he also spent two years in prison. That's rough. I heard that it was for his lover. But when he was arrested, his lover disappeared. Heaven knows he'll be punished. Maybe he had his reasons. What reasons? That guy's ruthless. If you want to talk about ruthlessness, my Xiangdong's ruthless too. Here, eat something. Is he really crippled? He's quite handsome, but you wouldn't think so when you see him walk. It's raining. He's inside. Stop! You're suspected of prostitution and distribution of drugs. We have a search warrant. Please cooperate. Search the premises for drugs or other prohibited items. Keep your hands to your side, palms facing forward. Turn the music off! Stay in that position and don't move. What's that music? Squat! Why is this door locked? Open it. Open the terrace door. Sit. Nothing. Captain, nothing to report. Let's go. Get dressed, you're coming to the station. Or don't you like wearing clothes? Ladies and gentlemen, we rent imperial costumes from the Qing dynasty. Rentals are at the corner, so you'll get photos of unforgettable memories of our picturesque village. We also offer plenty of local delicacies for you to enjoy. How many tickets? What tickets? You want to go to the village? 30 Bucks. Brother Fei! It's really you. Long, I almost didn't recognize you. Are you ripping off tourists again? Fei's from the village. Brother Fei. Let's get on. Take care, Brother Fei. A lot's different. - Didn't you leave to find work? - Yeah… But I wasn't happy, so I came back. Where were you? Your sister said you were in Yiwu. So I went there. But I didn't find you. I wasn't in Yiwu very long. Then I went to Shenzhen. Fei, how long are you staying? It depends. Sister... Why didn't you tell me you were coming? I wanted to surprise you. You look even better now. Why's your hair so short? It makes your ears look bigger. Really? Did you eat? I can make you something. - Let's have lunch together. - Okay. Li Kang! - My little brother's back. - Dad isn't here. - Doudou. - He went to the neighbour's. - This is Uncle. - Hello, Uncle. Good boy. Give Uncle a hug. Your uncle held you when you were little. I brought a toy for you. This is for you. Doudou, no. Mom. Fei's here to visit you. This money offering is from Fei. Use it where you are now. The family's all doing fine. Dad and Grandpa are the same. Last week, Grandpa had a doctor's appointment, there are no big problems. Please protect him. Also protect Fei. Make sure he's safe. Fei, say a few words to Mom. Mom, is everything alright where you are? I wasn't a dutiful son and couldn't come to see you in the end. I hope you're not sad. But don't worry, I'll take good care of Dad and sister's family. Mom, I miss you. Take this. Have it made into a ring. For your lover. Don't be so picky. You know what they say: The only ones left are the ones nobody wants. Hurry up and get married. Don't be like Fei, who's on his own and all alone. Grandpa, it's me, Fei. I'm back. Fei. Fei. Fei! Dad. Dinner's almost ready. Go wash up. Come, drink. This is how men are supposed to drink. A Cai, tell your mom to stop cooking. It's enough. It's not that much, keep drinking, there are more dishes coming. A Jie, what are you doing? Give me my water gun back. Stop messing around. A Jie, I'm your grandpa! Quit playing around! You have no manners! What naughty kids. Sit down or you'll be in trouble with your dad. A Cai, come here and control your kid! No manners at all. He sprayed water on me. A Jie, stop messing around or I'll beat you to death. Eat with the others. You hear me? Let's drink! You're just the same. I keep telling you you need to teach your kids manners. But you don't listen. If A Jie keeps this up, you'll be really sorry someday. Dad, I have to get up before sunrise for work. How can I find time for that? His mother can take care of him. That's just excuses. Raising kids these days is hard. And you have two. That's not easy. That's life. Fei, do you have a girlfriend? Your dad has been waiting for grand kids a long time. Not yet. Just so you know, young people these days are hooking up before marriage. Fei, is your uncle right? I don't have money or a career. No one's interested in me. Getting married isn't difficult. Just find someone who'll work hard with you. Girls have high standards these days. Then stay here and I'll introduce you to a girl from the village. You're almost 30. If you wait longer, even the village girls won't want you. And then your family will lose face. Liang Guixiang, you're his father. Aren't you worried? He's gone all year. I can't control him. Let him deal with it on his own. Yes, Brother, city people and village people think differently these days. Don't interfere with the affairs of others. So based on what you're saying, city people don't need to get married? Look at Guo Lao Yi's oldest daughter, she's over 30 and doesn't want to get married. You can't tell if she's a man or a woman. She must be one of those perverts. Fei, do you want to be one of those perverts like her? Brother! Uncles, enjoy your meal. I'm going to check on Grandpa. Fei, what your uncles say is for your own good. You dare show your face to your grandpa? You realize he's sick because you made him so mad! Why is it my fault? What you did in the city, you know very well. Your family lost face because of you. Even we, the Zhang Family, are ashamed. Do you get that? Fei, please sit down. Stop! Are you trying to kill your grandfather? - Stop right there! - Dad! - Dad! - Fei! Stop it! - Damn it, get out of the way! - Dad! Fei! Only after leaving did I realize this is a good place. I went also to Shenzhen to find you, but I didn't. I found a job in a factory there. Sixteen hours a day. I never even saw the sun. Fei, you always beat me at swimming when we were kids. If you meet the right person, don't let them go. The opportunity may not come again. Life is so long. I don't want you to be lonely. Don't worry about Dad. I'll take care of him. You need to start thinking of yourself. Take a nap. My cousin's son died yesterday. The one with money. Her son drowned in the reservoir. This kid was always very well behaved and got good grades. His parents let him take all kinds of lessons. Piano, painting. It's hard to get into a good university. He went on holiday with his classmates and drowned. He was their only child. In the past few years, they worked hard and earned a lot. What good did it do them? You didn't show up. Our godfather isn't happy about that. He says you're ungrateful. The old jerk. He says he won't help you out next time. Did you give him my money gift? You can trust me. I just got 3000, I'll transfer it to you now. And I'll get you the rest. Forget it. Just invite me to dinner the next time you get paid. Hello? Fei! I've brought you everything you like to eat. Smoked ham. And also... Thank you. Have you eaten? - I'll invite you to dinner. - Okay. - I'll take this up first. - Okay. You can wait here. Okay. Why did you suddenly come here? Does your uncle live here? Do you have friends here? You're my friend. Does your grandmother know that you're visiting me? She doesn't know anything, Fei, why aren't you eating? How long do you plan on staying? I'm not going back. Fei, can I stay with you for a while? It's not convenient. This is my cousin, Long. This is Brother Yong. Brother Yong. Just call me Yong. Let's go. I'll introduce you to the owner. Damn, does everybody from your village look so hot? I can give up hooking right now. He doesn't do that. A delicious piece like that shouldn't be wasted. Stop the nonsense. Can you find him a place to stay tonight? Let me think. Don't you have to work during the day? I haven't had a day off in weeks. Why are you drinking? Because you've been ignoring me. I said I've been busy lately. If you're busy, I could help you. I can clean your apartment. I can also cook for you. Just because we're from the same village, doesn't mean we have to be friends. Don't drink so much. You should go find someone else. If it's a question of money, I can double it. That's not what this is about. I've never kissed a man in my life. Young man, please consider it destiny. I'm begging you. The owner agreed. He'll deduct a month's pay for the damages. Just apologize to the customer. I quit. And I won't pay either. Are you aware how Yong pleaded for you? You think you can just quit? Do you know how much shit I put up with every day? I'm not here to live this kind of life! Who doesn't work hard for their money? Life is just eating, drinking, shitting, sleeping and earning money. If I wanted to live like that, I could've stayed in the village. Be a tour guide and rip off tourists. I would never have come here. Why am I here? For this moldy mattress? I give half my pay for this shitty place. Fei, how can people live like this? Who knows why we're alive? You're not in the position to make demands. Just think about it. A dog in a cage stops barking after a few days. Fei, how could you turn out this way? People like us can't expect our dream life here. You should go. This place doesn't suit you. I think you live a good life here. If you can make it, so can I. Can you? You want to do it? So let's do it right now! If you sell your body, everybody will look down on you. You'll be despised by your family forever. Selling ​​yourself? Who doesn't sell themselves to make money? My uncle worked in a tannery all his life. He ended up with cancer and died alone far away from home. Isn't that also selling your body? Tell that to the cops when they catch you. Where are you going? I'll go wherever I want to go. Fei! Whether you help me or not, I've already made up my mind. He called to say how he loves me, and he invited me to dinner. He even booked a private room. That day I didn't check, I just let him go. He said he works for city government and wanted to support me. He also said that he could get me a new job or pay for college. You're just too stupid. Then I had to piss really bad and went to the bathroom. When I came back, he was gone. Motherfucker… - My phone, my wallet… - You idiot. Even my expensive sweater and my fancy lighter, all gone. Can you believe this guy? So you are here to steal food from our mouths? You do your job, I do mine. Who said anything about stealing? Have you even done this before? I bet you're still a virgin. You need pubic hair down there for this job. Do you even have any? I bet he doesn't. If you can do it, so can I. Okay, then show us what you got. Take off your clothes. I bet he's too scared to take off his clothes. Then show us your little brother. You know what they say, big talk, small cock. Strip! Or do you need me to teach you how? Take it off first. He's really doing it! Strip, strip! Alright, cut it out. This kid's pretty good, he can stay. That's not a good idea. Get dressed, we're leaving. Thank you. Babe, take your clothes off too. Come help me with the dough. Babe, would you mind leaving me alone with Long today? Whatever makes you happy. So, Teacher Fei, did I behave well today? It's all fine. Then why do you seem upset? No, everything's fine. Everyone has to die when their time comes. If you want to cry, cry. Sister Lulu, can you read my palm too? I'm so beautiful, where's my prince? Your lines are too complicated. - You call yourself a beauty. - Aren't I? - I'll give you more soup. - Okay. Thanks. When will Fei go home for the funeral? - His relatives don't want him there. - He's not going back? His uncle's family is really cruel. Okay, come on, let's drink. I'm not going back this year either. Why not? You'll be all alone. I can't stand traveling during New Year's, 30 hours in a train and then a bus just to get home. You're happy to see your family on the first day. - Then relatives ask questions. - Then it starts. What do you do? How much do you make? Have you bought an apartment? Do you have a fiancé? Want me to introduce you to one? Isn't that annoying, the same questions every year? That's why I'm not going. When I go home for New Year's, my stepfather's very good to me. Every morning he heats my room. He's afraid I might catch cold. He tries not to wake me up. He's crazy about having a son. When I called him dad last year, he almost cried. Heartwarming. I tell you, you are one lucky kid to have such a good dad. Come, let's toast to this kid's luck. To a good dad. Every time I go back for New Year's, my mom starts crying three days before I leave. Then I cry too. Once we cry together, I don't want to leave home anymore. Don't talk nonsense. Give me a hug. Let's have a shot. Yeah, a round. Does everybody have something to drink? You have something, right? And I'll pour some for myself. That is my last drink. I'm pregnant. After New Year's, Xiangdong and I will move back to Shandong. Down it! Congratulations, Lulu. You're going to be a mother. Take care of yourself. I'll raise my child well with Xiangdong. Why don't you say a few words? We're not coming back. These six years were the most important of my life. I used to want to stay here forever. But now I want to start a real family with Lulu in Shandong. But these years with you have been the most precious in my life. Xiangdong, Lulu. Cheers to you both. I wish you all the happiness. And take good care of yourselves in Shandong. Grandpa, Fei's here with money for you. I'm not allowed to come say farewell. I hope you're not too sad. Grandpa, Fei's here with money for you. Isn't it cool? Where did you get this? I bought it for us. You can't waste money like this. What's the point of earning money if you don't spend it? Hop on! Where are we going? I'll go straight ahead, then turn left, then turn right, then maybe turn left again. - And then I'll spin in circles. - You're crazy. I may be crazy, but I'm happy. Fei, what am I to you? You're like a torch in the winter the blazing flame warms my heart. Whenever you sneak up near me the fire illuminates me. Your big eyes are bright and flashing like the stars in the sky, the brightest one. You are like a torch the blazing flame warms my heart. The café is three blocks from the square almost the distance between the neon lights and the moon. In the midst of their struggles, people comfort and hug each other searching and chasing, grasping at fragile dreams. Here we laugh, here we cry… This is my wife, Li Yu. My son, Dabao. Li Yong, Li Yin, say hi to the uncles. - Hello, uncles. - Such good kids. This is Liang Fei and his friend Liang Dong. - Liang Long. - Hello, Liang Long. Hello, Fei. Let's sit down and drink some tea. I ordered some dim sum too. Pour some more tea. Careful, it's hot. Xiaolai didn't tell me he's married, we would've brought gifts. No worries, you're old friends. He wanted to surprise you. Right? How do you know each other? We're family. - We come from the same village. - I see. That means we're family. No. So you're very close. Let me go. Let me go! I know what you're going through. What do you know? You don't know anything. I know you want to repay him. But you can't. His leg's already gone. I think he still loves you a lot. Don't you care? I think, if you were truly loved, you'd forgive him for anything, right? I know your story, Fei. I think you're a… Someone who deserves to be loved. Are you happy? Do you love Li Yu? Fei, do you really think that you're the only person I'll ever love? The past is past. You should cherish Long. You shouldn't visit me anymore. No, frankly… Brother, is this too expensive for you? Real estate is 70,000 to 80,000 per square meters these days. Pretty boy, lower the price a little. Why don't you transfer a little more money for me? - No, I mean, this money… - Forget it. Bye bye. Are you drunk? No. I think Long's a very good person. Yes. But I don't know… If I can make him happy. I don't know where you learned that nonsense. If you are happy yourself, you'll make others happy. Are you happy? I'm very happy. I'm like a spider, weaving my web everywhere and spreading my love. I don't let anyone get away and hold on tightly. How much hair gel do you use every day? To keep it so neat. Don't be so depressed, smile. How about it? Li Yong can call you Uncle No. 2. And the baby will call you Daddy No. 2. Very interesting. I just wish we could be all happy. We can live together. Take care of each other like a family. You, me, Xiaolai and his family. We can. We can live together, in a big house, with a yard and a pool. You really love him that much? He lost a leg for me. I could too. Don't deceive yourself anymore. You're always living for others. Do you think that makes you a great person? The way you sacrifice yourself, you constantly hurt yourself and sometimes others too. Xiaolai has left the pain behind. I know that you love me. We can have a good life together. We can also live the life we want. Isn't that good enough? You are my family, but he's my beloved. I can't change that. Do you think I'm stronger than you are? Do you think you can hurt me like that? I'm like a spider. Not letting anyone go… And loving everyone. Is that so wrong? You devoured me, that's not love. - There are still clothes to wash. - Okay, be right there. The washing machine's ready. Please sign here. Okay, thank you. Thanks. Will you teach A Yong how to ride a bicycle? - Mom, come on. - Okay. A Yong, I'm coming. Open the door! Fei! I don't need your pity. I'm begging you, spare me. Long's gone.
