Subtitles by explosiveskull Son of a bitch. Damn people driving around. What's the matter? What, are you fucking stupid? Are you stupid? It's going to cost you $200. But, hey, who cares? It's Vegas, right? It's Vegas. It's not like you need the money, right? - Henry? - Yeah, yeah. Hop on in. Welcome to Las Vegas. Thanks, man. Thrilled to be here. Well, hope you can check it off your list. How long you been in Vegas? My whole life. Sweet. That must be nice. No. No, it isn't. Mirage. Yeah, it's on the phone. I mean, just take a look around at this place. Look at it. I mean, it's... It's got, you know, money in its veins, you know? The whole reason it's here is to make just a couple people richer. So, the Mirage, huh? Means you got a big client. Going to have enough to tip me on the way back? I thought you weren't allowed to accept tips. I thought prostitution was illegal. No, no, not supposed to. Sorry? Not supposed to accept tips. You're right. Maybe I can get you on the way back. I don't have any cash right now. Sure. Almost there. Thank you. No problem. Should I stick around? I'm sorry? Should I stick around? Oh, no. I'll just call someone. Okay. I mean, you know, Vegas actually is the one city where money can buy you anything. Oh, but if you don't have money... well... go fuck yourself. It's ridiculous, it's ridiculous. Good luck to you. Thank you. Have a good night. Good morning. This is your wake-up call. Fuck you. You know I can't reinstate you. It's been three years. Yeah, but I've seen no improvement. I see two assault charges. One against a fellow officer. Two restraining orders against you. One from your new ex-wife. We're separated. Tell me, are you still investigating your wife's murder? Yes, I am. You're not on that case. You never were. You know who's on that case? Nobody. It's sitting in a box on a shelf somewhere collecting dust until this guy shows up and kills another woman the same way he killed Helen. Listen, I get it. If my wife were killed, I'd do the exact same thing. But I'm not your therapist. And I'm not here to sympathize with you. I'm here to protect the department from another lawsuit. We live in a new age. Everyone has a fucking camera. We can't have a loose cannon on the force. Man, you got stuff? No. Go, go away. No. Come on, man. I got money. Just go. Leave me... leave me alone. Come on, man. You know that... you know that good stuff you gave me last time? You got to be kidding right now. - What? What do you want? - That good stuff. Look, I don't have anything, all right? I got money this time. Goddamn junkies. Look, you ask me this every night. Do you... you just don't remember? Look, I don't have anything. Just get off my car. Go. You scratch it, I'll beat the shit out of you. - Go. - Be cool. - Just go. - Just chill, chill, chill. Goddamn. Start journaling. Give me something to put on file. Just use your cell phone. Give me five minutes every day. Text me. You don't have to come in. You don't even have to see me. I want to help you. But you got to help me. All right? I'm not the bad guy here. So why am I? You beat the shit out of those two dealers in broad daylight. You scared the hell out of your ex-wife. Hi. Alicia? Yup, that's me. All right, well, welcome aboard. Okay. Let's do this. Okay. Three years ago, I was working undercover. I was running drugs for an organization out of Mexico City. Got into some pretty rough stuff. Um... my cover was blown. And they killed my wife. You're a piece of shit! So, uh, it's Treasure Island you're going to, right? Right, yes. You know, um, my favorite place on the Strip was the Riv. - And it was... the Riviera. - Right. It's right up the street from Treasure Island. And they had dollar blackjack, dollar roulette, I think. Anyway, now the bastards are just tearing it down. Making it a convention center. It's just... That sucks. Um... So, yeah, yeah. I, um, I beat up some guys. Some local... drug pushers. Just piece-of-shit scumbags. I can't say that I wouldn't do it again. I can say I wouldn't do it again. I wouldn't do it again. Not because I give a shit about them, but because of the job. I'm a good cop. Well... question. Do you know a good place to get drinks around here? Possibly? Yeah, yeah. You want to make a detour? Is that possible? Yes, please. I guess it's possible. Yeah, of course. Yeah, I know this place right off the Strip, it's tucked away. There's great drink specials yet it's quiet. Something like that? Um... yeah, I kind of meant like a... like a liquor store. Yeah. Yeah... - I'm sorry. - No, no. I know. I know. I didn't mean for... - No... - Sorry. No, that's not what... I wasn't thinking that. I just, you know... if you wanted to come back with somebody else... you know, that's a good spot. Oh, well... maybe you could show me sometime. Sure. Do you mind waiting here for just a moment? I'll be right back. Yeah, sure. Awesome. Thank you. Stupid. What do you think you're doing, huh? What, do you think she likes you? Get over yourself, Henry. She doesn't like you. She's just another whore. Just another whore. What are you going to do, huh? Huh? You going to do it? Hello? Oh, hey, Dee. Yeah, I'm coming. I'm on my way. Wait, what? What do you mean the strippers are...? Dee, make him wait. You know he's mine. Okay. Yes, I'm on my way. I'm on my way. I'm coming. All right, I'm coming. I'll see you soon. Alright. Bye. Sorry about that. Big party, huh? Yeah. Bachelorette party. Hey, do you want a drink? Can't. I'm driving. I won't tell anyone. Wouldn't want to crash, now would we? Uh... hey. Isn't Treasure Island just down the street? It's just a shortcut. Look, I appreciate that, but Treasure Island's just down the road. Oh, you're right. I'm... Yeah, I'm sorry. You should have done it when you had the chance. When did I have the chance? What? Nothing. Sorry. Sorry. Can you just get me there? Yeah, absolutely. - Thanks. - Get you right there. Thank you. We're there. Thanks. Have a good night, huh? You too. God... I just need to get my hands on her. I like her too. What do you think I'll do with her? Oh, we'll have a great time. I'll tell you what she was like. Tell you how wet she was. One West 823, over. Go ahead, One West 823. Please stand by while I notify Homicide and the coroner. One West 823, standing by. One North 89 en route. ETA: 20 minutes. Has the scene been secured? The scene's secure. We have a Jane Doe, mid-30's, roughly decomposed. You're late. I was sleeping. Passed out. Whatever. It's not like I'm on the job anymore. No, but you still showed up. Yeah. Moved the body already. Yeah. We considered waiting for you, but you're not part of the force anymore, so... That's two this month. Yeah. This one was pretty well decomposed by the time we got to it, so... Let me guess. Blunt force trauma? Most likely a crowbar? Yeah. But it's not a serial killer, so... enough. This is a big-ass desert. If you find two, there's 20 out here. Are you done? I want to get out of here. Yeah, I got what I need. Come on, man, give me something. You want something? Sober up, get on the scanner. Maybe show up before we clear the scene. Get your shit together. Fuck. Hey, I'm here. Okay. - Hey. - Hey. - How are you? - Good, how are you? Good. Well, I've been told that I have trouble letting go. Actually... Debbie told me that right before she kicked me out, so maybe it's true. Spent three years investigating my deceased wife, Helen. And then I get remarried to... this chick. And she calls it quits after six months. So, yeah, maybe that's true. She's too young for me anyway. She got daddy issues. What the fuck are you doing? Are you fucking stalking me? - No. - Oh, my God. This is a stakeout. I'm calling the real fucking police. Yeah, go ahead. I'm 50 yards away from the property. So you think you can just sit there and watch me from 50 yards away? I don't... No, I'm not. Really, you're going to send Joe Cool over here? Debbie... Just move the fucking car. Yeah? "Move the fucking car." Go back in the fucking house. Art... I'm out of here. Just go back inside. You don't want to mess with this right now. Thank you. Fucking Ken doll. It'll be okay. Guess what? We just got married. Our Elvis was the minister. No, he's... Wait, oh, wait. No, our minister was the Elvis. Wait a minute... right? The singers were celebrities. Oh, and there is a jukebox playing our favorite song. And we did 'shrooms. It was totally a spur-of-the-moment thing. I just won the jackpot on the slot machines. I was like, why the hell not? I mean, we got a giant check now. We can get a house. You know, we've been talking about getting married. So you won a whole bunch of money and decided to give half of it to her. So we're going to Red Rock? Yeah, yeah, we hear it's the best park in town. You realize it's midnight, right? So? Your funeral. We're there. Huh? Oh, yeah. Come on. It's spooky. It's so hot out here. Yo. Hey, man. Here. - Fuck... - Just wait here a minute. I got more where that came from, all right? All right, yeah, fine. All right. Take our picture. Yeah. Wedding photos! Okay, here, let me set this up. Let me set this up. Babysitting a couple of tripping assholes. That's what she said. You're stroking my stick, babe. Okay, okay, yeah, like a little tepee or something. - Babe, you got it! - Yeah, I am the man. Okay, don't move. Don't move. I think... Done! Damn it. Fucking... - I had it. Okay, okay, okay. - Babe, go... Yo. Hey, man, sorry to bother you, but could you, like, take some photos of us or something? Come on, man. I'll give you more money. Yeah, all right. Yeah, come on. I'm not being a dick. Okay... All right. - Okay... - Shh! Don't shush me. Okay, okay, just wait till we're in frame... Shh! Stop. Just wait till... yeah, like that. Just push the button. Not yet! Okay... Hey, man. Whoa, wait... what are you doing? Kill 'em! Let's go to the strip club. - Strip club! - Yeah, I want to see some pussy. They took you out to the middle of the desert at midnight. Here, take us to a strip club. Come on, they pretty much just bag and tag themselves. Just finish them off. You're like the only guy we know out here. He could be our best man. Yeah. Dude, this isn't our hotel. We're at... the Arizona Charlie. I am done with you. Get out of the car! Jesus. Get out, get out. Oh, goddamn it! Hey! Art. Hey. Damn. I was expecting your call earlier. Yeah, I figured. Got the papers in front of you right now, I just know it. No, actually, I'm in the can, so... Just give me the name of the girl. I can't tell you that. You owe me. I saved you twice. Just stop talking. Stop. If I tell you this information, I could lose my fucking job. Never stopped you before. All right, asshole, listen up. Not repeatable. I'm not writing a report. She's one of your friend's girls. Whoa. He's got girls now? Who is it? Police. You got some ID? Just tell Reggie that Art's here to see him. Thank you. Who the fuck are you? Art. Oh, you're Reggie's boy? Yeah. You think you can go find him for me? You're a fucking cop? Not rerouting shit? - Hello. - Hi. Diamond, sweetheart, it's not this kind of business. Come on, sweetheart. Just chill out in the back. I'll be right back there. Be right with you. Art, what the fuck brings you here? Looks like the state paid you pretty good. Oh, you think your settlement paid for this? I'm expanding, man. I got girls now. I'm sure they love to see how you're spending their money. What? It's an escort service. It's all aboveboard. My girls all pay their taxes, right? What's the tax on a blowjob? Hey, I don't owe you jack shit, dude, and you don't have anything on me. I told you everything I knew, and you didn't want to hear it. So I'm not doing this around and around with you. Listen, I know the girl they found in the desert was one of yours. I'm just trying to track down her killer. I-I was friends with... Britney, shut the fuck up! What are you afraid of? My girls don't talk to cops. I'm trying to keep your girls from getting killed, asshole. All right, fine. Pay the rate, you get the time. Okay. Twenty bucks ain't going to cut it. You think I'm a fucking tourist? Tell me you never turned a $20 trick before. All right, fuck you, then. All right, Jesus! Talk to him for 15 minutes. But don't give him a blowjob, okay? He's a cop. All right. Tell me what you know. Uh... last I heard from her was February 16th. We kept track of each other like that. Amber only had one client that night. It was 220 Western Avenue. She told me it was a 20-minute job. She checked in with me when she got there... said it was a family man's home. Twenty minutes later, she said she was leaving. She never came back. Time's up. All right. Listen, why don't you do me a favor. If you think of anything, let me know, okay? Thank you. Reggie, good to see you again. I don't owe you shit. Remember that. Okay. What are you going to do about it, pussy? Get the fuck out of here. Hi. Uh... ...can I talk to your husband? I'm sorry, he's at work. - Where does he work? - Security, at the Palace. Is he a big guy? I guess so, yeah. Damn it. Is something wrong? Go back upstairs. Uh, no, nothing. Um... You know when he'll be home? Probably around 8:00. Are you sure everything's okay? I'll have to ask him that. - Is he all right? - He's fine. What did you say your name was? I didn't. What the hell is that smell? It was that guy from Harrah's I picked up. He was disgusting, had dried puke on his face. Oh, come on. Come on, it was you. No, I swear to God, the second he got in the car the whole thing reeked. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Look at that one over there. Where? Come on, the ho with the purse. I mean, she's not all that bad... considering. Oh, yeah? You like what you see, huh? Come on, I'm not going to pay for it. Hey, who said anything about paying for it, huh? Nah... I'm working. What, you call this working? Huh? What are you, nervous or something? I'm not nervous. I just don't want to do it. What? Whoa, is it that time of month again? Hmm? Huh, pussy? What the fuck, man? What are you doing in my driveway? Why don't you tell me where you were on February 16th? Then I'll get out of your driveway. George, is everything okay? Everything's fine. I'm just going to have a quick conversation with this man and have him go on his way. You can call the police. Tell him we have a trespasser. I am the police. Vegas PD. Just go inside and close the door, honey. You have a badge? Nope. All I want to know is what happened on February 16th. How the fuck would I know? Drinking, bowling. Drifting, maybe. Yeah? How about a prostitute? Listen, you fuck, I know she was here. - Why'd you kill her? - Kill her? I didn't kill her. I only fucked her. Get back in the fucking house, woman. Get back in the house! What happened? I put her in a car I sent her home. Who called the car, you or her? - I did. - Did you see the driver's face? No. Did he text you when he arrived? I don't know! Then check your fucking phone! Okay! I got it, yeah. What's his fucking number? 702-817... I'm sorry, ma'am. Just... homicide investigation. I just had to ask him a couple questions. I... I got the wrong guy. I'm sorry. Sorry. No, not anymore. Not doing it... No, no... I am fine. I am in control. I am in control. I am in control. I am in control. Detective Hutchins. Hey, buddy, listen. It's me again. I got one last favor to ask you. And I told you to call other people when you need favors. I got a real lead on the dead escort. The night before she was murdered she was out on a call. The address was 220 Western Avenue. You think the date did it. No, I don't. Well, then what's going on, Art? Talk to me. What's happening? Sorry, I shouldn't have... I shouldn't have bothered you. Detective Art Matthews calling for Henry Falcon. I have some questions for you regarding a homicide investigation. - Fuck! - Give me a call back at 702-445-0318. Fuck. He knows. If he knew, he would have arrested you already. You fucking killed her. I just did what you wanted me to do. Yeah, but I don't do that shit. Oh. He had another wife. And look, her address. 3126 Rainbow Ave. No, no, no. He's already looking for us. It's either him or us. Then why don't you want to kill him, you dumb fuck? Goddamn. I'm disappointed. In the past week, I haven't seen one single constructive thing you've done. You're obsessed with your wife's killer. You're off the force because we're trying to get you off the case. You asked me for the meeting. What did you think I was going to say? You recorded the videos. You could have lied to me. Look! Here I am at the park. Here I am at the bookstore. Here I am at the theater. Henry, this is Detective Matthews calling again. I still haven't heard back from you. Art, you're delusional. She's coming. I said leave me alone. Knock-knock. Hi. May I get a ride? You're supposed to pay with your phone. I know. I know. My phone is dead. You should have tipped last time. Yeah, I know. But I'll make it up to you. How? Take me to Flamingo and we can talk about it on the way. Yeah. We'll work something out. Great. Thank you. It has been the worst day. Sorry to hear that. Yeah. Yeah, so, like, my baby's sick, and then now her babysitter's sick, so she's with my sister for a little. And, like, the hospital bills. Oh, my God, the hospital bills. They're killing me. Sir, there's nothing I can do. Please just give me one more day. I'm waiting for a check to get here. Sir, we have a strict policy. You know how long I've been staying here? I must have a free night by now. I'm checking your invoice, sir. God. Listen, I'm hanging up now. I'll bring a credit card by later, okay? And so he's trying to get my sister to give her to him, and my sister is such a bitch. Yeah, it's pretty tough. And so my boyfriend said he'll marry me, then the state can't take my baby. Thank you so much for the ride. Um... we had a deal. I'm sorry, I can get you the next time. Yeah, you've said that before. I really mean it. No, I think you can pay me right now. I told you, I don't have any money. My last client robbed me. You think I'm going to believe a fucking whore? Honestly, I... I don't. Mm-hmm. Who do you think I am? You can't just walk over me like that. Mm-mm. Listen, I have somewhere to be. Oh, yeah? - Yeah, I have a job. - Oh, you have a job? I think you need to pay for this job right here. I'll make it up to you. We'll just find someplace quiet. I have a room at the Flamingo. It's pretty quiet. You think I'm just a mark? Uh-uh. Okay, all right, I'm sorry. I should have been honest with you. Listen, I've been doing this since I was 13. Do you have any idea how it is to sell your body? You're just an actress who couldn't cut it in Hollywood. I got you now. Where are you going? Oh... I'm just looking for someplace quiet. It's fine, it's fine. Not yet, not yet. Please just pull the car over, and I'll give you whatever you want. - You know you want me. - Stop it. Stop it. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Stop it. It's a lie. It's a lie. It's a lie. - I'll call the police. - Oh, well, that's convenient. Your phone works. I guess you should have just paid me, then we wouldn't be here. Go ahead, call them. Hey, I'm the whore that works over by the Flamingo! Fight me like that, huh? Oh, yeah, give me a little fight. Give me a little fight! Hey, remember what you said? Do you? You said that you couldn't afford it. You did, you did. How about this, huh? How about this? I'm going to look in that little purse of yours, and if we find less than... 200 bucks, huh? How about 200 bucks? We'll say you're not lying, you fucking whore. How about that, huh? Yeah. Fucking... fucking stay there. Fucking stay still. Ooh. Huh? That's a nice little purse you got here. What's this? Money for my baby. It's for your baby? That's a lot of money. Oh, goddamn it! If I only had fucking kids, you fucking goddamn whore. Why did you do it? Oh, why? Oh, fuck. Oh, God, why'd you kill her? Fuck. Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. God, you're going to get us caught. How does... how does that happen? It's the same number. Fuck. Goddamn. Fuck! It's a detective. What's he want? What's he know? You fucking killed her. I just did what you wanted... My neck... Reggie! Fuck, you again? - Is Britney here? - Who? It's all right. Just the crazy cop. Britney, the girl that I talked to the last time I was here. Oh, yeah. Uh-huh. Well, she didn't show up for work yesterday. Or today. You see, the girls make their own schedules. And I got a policy around here that if they're not making me money, then, you know, not my responsibility. Yeah, well, I think she's dead. You telling me I got two dead girls on my hands now? If I was a cop, motherfucker, I'd pin you for the link between those two. That's all I got to say. Reggie, come on, man. Talk to me. Talk to me. Talk to me! Get rid of him. Get the fuck out of here. - Fuck you, man! - Fuck you, pig! - Open the fucking door! - Fuck you! Henry... I'm going to give you one more chance. Meet me tomorrow at 3:00 p.m. at the Desert Breeze Inn. I'll be waiting on the bench at the top of the south circle. Be there, motherfucker. It's an unusual meeting point, Detective. Yeah. You questioned for murder often? I watch a lot of movies. So why'd you come? I've got nothing to hide from you. Well, that's good. Can you tell me what happened on February 16th? No. No, I can't. I have no fucking clue what day that was. Let me refresh your memory. Picked up a whore at 220 Western Avenue. Remember that? I drive a lot of whores from point A to point B. Yeah, well, this particular one didn't make it to point B. Really? What'd you do with her? I can't answer for where you think she was supposed to be. All right? Can say I dropped her off where she asked to be dropped off. But a lot of whores get sick of the life, you know? Run away. Oh, is that right? They found her buried in the desert. That's unfortunate for her. Yeah, well, I got a witness who says you were the last person seen with her. That guy says you were the last one seen with me. Look, I don't keep paperwork on where I pick up and drop off fares, all right? So if that's all you got, I got better things to do. Helen. So you remember Helen. You stabbed her to death in my kitchen. He knows everything, you fuck! He doesn't have anything. If he knew something, he wouldn't be meeting us in a park. He's meeting you in a park because he's going to fucking kill you. I told you, he doesn't need evidence, he doesn't need proof. He just wanted to know that you killed her and you fucking gave it right to him. Just let me drive. You're going to kill a cop. You have to do it carefully. It's not like killing a whore. This is not the time to hide, Henry. What are you talking about? Now is the perfect time to hide. You're going to run away your whole life. Come on, stand up. Be a man about it. Yeah, I'm going to stand up and I'm going to get a bullet for it. That's why you got to hit him first. Mac. What? I need you to run some plates for me. Arizona. Copper can't run his own plates? I need it off the books. Give me a couple hours. Thanks. For all I know, the whole department is looking for me. Use your head. Did you see a badge? Did you see backup? Did he have a gun? He's gone rogue, Henry. Hello? I got the 411 on your plates. - Mm-hmm? - I got a name. Henry Falcon. I knew that already. But he put down a fake address. What do you mean it's a fake address? It's a vacant lot in Phoenix. So how am I supposed to find this guy? Not my problem. Fuck you, Mac! I got it. Yeah, I got it. Come on, it's green, asshole. Go! It's green, asshole. Hey! Don't get in that car! Who's your date? The big, bad wolf? Of course. I even brought a basket. You know, to be honest, I almost missed you. I thought we were looking for a blonde. Oh, yeah, sorry. That's a really old picture. Don't feel bad. It works for you. Thanks. Fuck! You wanted my account of what happened on the night that Helen was murdered. You knew I was undercover, and that somebody leaked my identity. When I got home, the door was wide open. Helen was inside and she had been stabbed to death. No prints. No forced entry. I'm no longer on active duty, because I was a suspect. They think that I could have... slit my wife's throat? Stabbed her repeatedly? I was betrayed. So as much as red is your color, what's going on with the cape? It's for a costume party. You party a lot? Little more than I used to. Can I be honest with you? Oh, yeah, of course. I hate this. It's going to be people from high school, and I hate everyone from high school. Oh, yeah? Come on, you got to tell me why. My friends... I don't know. They were always doing something. Just felt like I didn't fit in. I guess I still don't fit in. They're all doing big stuff, and... and I don't do anything by myself. Yeah, I get it. Thanks. No, no. I get it. I don't know. I guess I just feel a little ridiculous. You know, I mean, I haven't seen them in a few years, and here I am for a costume party. Well, you're dressed to the nines. Hey, go big or go home, right? You're not going home. Hey, wait, this isn't my stop. No. No, this is my stop. The "check engine" light's on. Just give me a minute. I'll get it fixed. Oh, it's okay. I can just call another car. Don't. Put the... put the phone down. Look, I'll handle it. Just give me a minute, all right? Look, I really have to go. I said don't use the phone! But you didn't do anything. Get out! What big eyes you have. You remember what you told me? - Please! Please! - You remember what you told me? That you can't do anything on your own. That you can't do anything on your own, huh? Remember that? You remember that, huh? Come here. Oh, hey. Hey, no, no, come on. Be quiet, Little Riding Hood. No one can hear you scream out here. Oh, please! Help. Help me. Goddamn! I thought you got rid of her last night! No. I saved her. You saved her? You can't do that! Yes, I can. And tonight... Oh, Henry, tonight... we'll be rid of Art. What are you going to do? Don't... don't look at me like... Don't do that. Oh, I don't want to do this anymore. I don't want to do this anymore. Just stop. Just go away. Please, just go away. Calm down, Henry. You're going to be all right. We're going to have ourselves... a good old time. Now what? Shit. Debbie? Art, I saw you taking photos. Debbie, that wasn't me. - I fucking saw you. - I... listen, Debbie... - I'm calling the police. - Yes, call the police. Just... listen, lock the door and don't open it for anybody, no matter what. I'll... Debbie? Fuck! Debbie? Get the fuck away from me. It's okay. It's just me. Yeah, you get away from me. I was worried about you. I've already called the police. They're on their way. Your door was open, and I just... I wanted to check on you. Those photos were texted to me. I just wanted to make sure you were okay. Sorry. Sorry. The door was open. Why was your door open? It wasn't open. Henry? - Henry! - There's nobody here. - Just go. - Show your face! Go! I know he's here. Oh, God. Please, just go. This is going to be my last journal entry. I spent three years searching for my wife's killer. And I found him. He's a driver. His name is Henry Falcon. He's killed at least three other women since Helen's death. In case we never see each other again, I just wanted you to know... that I found peace. Detective Hutchins. This is Nathan Jones. What was Art's identity when he was working undercover? Henry Falcon. I'll take it from here. Get the fuck away from me. It's okay. It's me. Subtitles by explosiveskull
