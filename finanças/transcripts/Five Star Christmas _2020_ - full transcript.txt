RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM Yes, I will call her back. Hey, Merry Christmas. Hugh! You did such a great job on that Peterman account. It's just awesome. Thanks. It would mean a lot if you could tell the boss. I already did. Here. Put some sparkling water on that coffee stain. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - There she is. - Hi. I heard you signed a new one. Yes, I did. It wasn't that hard, considering what the last agency pitched them. Did you see this? Oh, my gosh. Santa looks like he's about to Rob electronics, not deliver them. I know. Hey, could you send a thank you to Dianne Terasino for setting this up, actually? One of those little spa package gift certificates. Got it. I will. Better head out early because the traffic to Connecticut is... Brutal. Yeah. So is your whole family going to make it? Yeah, brother, sister, grandma, gramps. Dad's so excited to have us all under the same roof again. What about Sean? Sean? We broke up. When? Like a month ago. What? I thought he was a good guy. He chewed with his mouth open. Bye Holly. Hey Carlos. Did you decide if you're going to go visit your family in Phoenix for the holidays? Not this year. That new car I bought set me back. Let me rephrase that. You're going to visit your family in Phoenix. Round-trip tickets? Lucy. Best. Boss. Ever! Oh, my god! Feliz navidad. Feliz navidad. Your shoelace is untied. So in Bolivia, we can walk on the biggest salt flats in the world. Hey, you realize that this time next month, we'll be giving our 30 days notice? Are you sure we can afford this? These co-live, co-work setups across the world are cheaper than our rent. We're going to be fine. I started my makeup blog for fun. And I didn't think being in IT would allow me to work while travelling around the world. Not bad for a girl from Hartford. How about this boy from Pinewood? At least you've been to Jamaica for your friend's wedding. I haven't even been outside of the country. But soon we'll be walking on clouds in Bolivia, seeing the Northern Lights in Iceland... Eating shrimp from the barbie in Melbourne! The world is our oy... What is going on? I have no idea. Hey pumpkin! Hey, grandpa. Hop on in. You're still driving old George? You bet. Ooh, it's cold. Okay. That's good. - There we go. - Yeah. I'm okay, I'm okay. Do you want me to drive? Oh, Amber. Don't you trust my driving? No, of course I do. It's just it's a long way to the house. - Better buckle up. - OK. Sorry, sorry... Okay, just let me get my seatbelt... Okay, no! No, no, don't have a seatbelt on. Lucy. Hi, Mr. Donahue, Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. It's so nice to see you. Can I have a cup of hot chocolate please? Coming right up. Thanks. So... Candy canes are right over. I believe there's one more of your favourite left. Thanks. Okay, peppermint, cinnamon, cherries, sassafras. That's my favourite. Mine too. My mom used to give them to us as stocking stuffers when I was a kid. Cool. I'm sure there's another one in here somewhere. I'll bet you for it. What you thinking? I bet I know more about these than you do. Whatcha you got? Mr. Donahue's been selling these sassafras candy canes for the last 20 years. But only in the last 10 years did he start selling this size. Also as a side note, the sassafras plant was introduced to European immigrants by native Americans who used the plant for a variety of medicinal purposes. Your turn. Candy canes were introduced in the 1600s but it wasn't until the early 1900s that flavours and stripes were added. Actual sassafras was banned in the 1960s because there were concerns that the oil was a health hazard. Really? Sounds like a draw. The actual botanical name is sassafras albidum. He's got you. Fine, it's yours. You know, in the spirit of Christmas, here you go. No, you won that fair and square. It's just a candy cane. It's sassafras and you won it, and that's that. Okay. Have it your way. Merry Christmas. You too. Okay, just a hot chocolate for me. Here you go. Thank you. That guy said I should give you this. And he paid for it, too. Lucky me. Too bad he's gone. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. What? Hello? "Lucy, welcome to the Ralston Inn. "Gone grocery shopping with your brother and Suzanne. Dad." Nine grand? Hey! I was hoping to get back before you. But the chairman of the Christmas board cornered me. His Santa has a toothache, so... guess who they've asked to step in this year? I told them I was busy running the Inn, but I figured it might be fun. I missed you so much. I missed you too, daddy. Speaking of your Inn, what is... Surprise! I hate surprises. - Hi. - Hi. You look good. Did you know about this? No, I had no idea. Hi. Good to see you. You too. I just have one question. Why? It's a secret. No, I was going to explain it to everybody, I just didn't want to do it more than once. Your grandpa's coming with your sister, and 'til then you can get settled in your rooms. Are they really our rooms anymore? When you're here, they are. We put all your stuff in the basement, you can go through it whenever you like. The basement?! Honey, what's the matter? Dad, I came home for Christmas. Home. Home is not here. This will always be your home. Where's the door frame with the notches of our heights? Where's the scratches in the floor from when I tried out my new roller-skates? Where is the bathroom faucet with the hot and cold all switched around? Where is that? What? Maybe we're in the wrong house. I know my own house, grandpa. Dad, what did you do? Me? What about you? Your hair is pink. Hey, is it true you changed your major again? Yes. Thank you. I did, yeah. This. It looks nice. Welcome to the Ralston Inn, guys. It's not bad for a retired Park Ranger, huh? Is grandma Margo coming? Tomorrow. You know your mom's mom likes to make a grand entrance. I hope you're not waiting 'til then to tell us what's going on. No. Living room, please. Where's the coatrack? I love your hair. Thank you. Pink is also not a Christmas colour. I just didn't know if you wanted to know that or not. What am I supposed to do, make it red and green? You could have picked one of them. Hello! Living room please! Please, everybody just sit. Okay, I know that it's a shock seeing our home turned into a Bed and Breakfast. You think, dad? Truth is, I missed you guys. This place was so empty and I thought this would be a great way to meet new people and maybe earn some money at the same time. Have you? Have I what? Made money. There were cost overruns on the renovation. But I have had some guests. I guess the answer's no. How much staff do you have? You're looking at him. How long have you been open? A month. How bad is it? Could be better. Just tell us, dad. Gonna turn it around. You were a Park Ranger. What do you know about running a Bed and Breakfast? I know people who do business plans and feasibility studies. Why didn't you call me? It was supposed to be a surprise. What about a website? I need something called a "domain name". IT is what I do. All right. In the meantime I have postcards in every tourist rack in town. Postcards? Is that like a telegram? What? There is some good news. I heard from Rick Bishop. Who's that? He's the guy who runs the Pinewood Cottage Inn. Now that is a nice place. I hear they make a great schnitzel. Anyway, he told me that there was this travel critic rumoured to be in the area, visiting Bed and Breakfasts for the holiday season. Who's the critic? Bea Turner. I've heard of her. I have some friends who user her site before booking a place to stay. Really? It's a nice website. "Trust Bea for the best B&Bs." She has a reputation of making or breaking a B&B with her ratings. I think she shows up at the B&B incognito. Look at this. Her last posting was yesterday. It was for a B&B in Milford. Meaning she's close. What if she comes and gives you a good rating? Your bookings will go way up. Bookings. I don't have any guests. You think that'll look bad? We can pretend to be your guests. You think? Dad, she's joking! You guys, this is... There are so many Bed and Breakfasts in this area. The odds that this woman is going to show up here is very slim. You're right. You're right. I'm going to go and get the groceries. You're like Scrooge and the Grinch rolled into one. Is no one else upset by this?! How could we be when you're the one taking up all the emotion? Oh please, didn't you drop your psychology major? And that's called deflecting. I'm really sorry you're upset about this, honey. Here, let me... Luce. I was really lonely in this big old house on my own, you know? When I was a Park Ranger, I loved meeting new people, hearing their stories. I can see how this makes your life better. Thanks, hon. Okay. Okay. So. You didn't... You didn't really answer the question. How bad is it? I can't hide anything from you. Mom used to say that about you too. She said it was one of your best qualities, among many. I have enough for two months if I don't turn it around. Okay. I have some savings. How much do you need to keep everything afloat? No, no, no. I'm not having my daughter sink her savings into my hare-brained idea. I won't let it keep me down. You got somebody coming? No. Excuse me. My tire has gone flat and I don't get reception here. Do you have a spare? I could fix it. I'm Ted, and this is my daughter Lucy. Thank you, but I have road service. I don't want to trouble you, I just need a working phone. No trouble. Road service will take a while. Right. This is so nice of you. Luce, can you give me a hand with this? Yes. That's very nice of you. I can grab that. Thank you. Where are you headed? Just a leisurely trip up to Maine to see some cousins for the holidays. Nice. Is this your Bed and Breakfast? It is. Finest in town, actually. Do you have any vacancy? Yes. As a matter of fact we do. I was planning on stopping at a place up the road, but... This seems nice. Great. Lucy, would you please make sure the Pinecone Room is ready for... Beth. Beth Thompson. Beth Thompson. What is it? Dad has a new guest. Well, at least that's something. Yeah, she's got a flat tire. He's out helping her with it. She said her name is Beth Thompson. B.T. As in Bea Turner! Maybe it's a coincidence. Looks like they really hit it off. No kidding. Look at them. Dad says he wants me to put her in the Pinecone Room. Which one is that? There was a Pinecone in our Room. Are you kicking me out of my room? Ever heard of taking one for the team? Yeah, but why does it have to be my room? What is she doing? You see that? She just took pictures of this place! Why would she do that? Because she really is Bea Turner. What are we going to do? A good rating would give him a boost. A bad one would sink him. Ted's right. An empty Inn doesn't look good. Okay, here's what we're going to do. We're all going to be the guests and staff. Like you said, Suzanne was joking. That's the best option that we have, honestly. We can play a married couple travelling through town. Okay, okay. But we're not just travellers, we are world travellers. Yeah! You're adorable. You get to be a guest too. Let's make you a... I want to be the chef. Since when do you know how to cook? Since I got an apartment off campus. Let's keep you as a guest. Why can't I be the chef? Because there's too much at stake if you blow it, honestly. I'm sorry, please. Grandpa, do you mind being the all-purpose worker? Sure. Okay, great. And why don't you have to take on a role? Because dad already introduced me as his daughter. I need my makeup bag. It's in the car. Okay. Okay, great. So we all have our marching orders. Let's move. All right, there you go. Thanks. You are quite handy with a tire Jack. I've helped many a stranded motorist. Used to be a Park Ranger. Well, you must have some stories to tell. My family's heard most of them. As a matter of fact, they are... Dad! Can I speak to you for a moment. Just, it's about our linen order. The what? Our linen order. The staff is ready to show you to your room. Thanks. Staff? Beth. If there's anything that you need. Just feel free to let me or my dad know. That's very kind. Thank you. I think she's Bea Turner. The B&B critic? Hello. Welcome. Welcome and welcome... To the Ralston Inn. Thank you. How do you do? My name is Clayton Warner. Hi. I'm a... I'm a guest. Beth Thompson. Nice to meet you. Do you need me to sign the register? Oh no, that's all right. We know who you are. Let me introduce you to my wife... Candace Lebeau. Please, call me Candace. Nice to meet you, Candace. Where are you from, Bea? Bea? Be-because we always like to know where our fellow guests are from. I'll take your coat? Sure. New York. Where are you from? More like, where aren't we from? Paris, Rome, Sydney. We've been all over. Well, that sounds exciting. Mr. Ralston, I need you to approve tonight's menu. Okay. Chef Francesca, nice to meet you. Beth, nice to meet you. Everybody is so friendly. Yes, they are. This is a beautiful fireplace. This is lovely. Annie made that. Annie? My wife. She passed 15 years ago. I'm sorry. Would you mind if I took a picture? Please, be my guest. Is the Pinecone Room ready? Yeah. Or so I've heard from the staff. Good. Please, follow me. Okay. Sassafras. Hi. Come in. Okay. Welcome. Is this your place? No, it's my father's. But I'm just here for the holidays, helping out. Nice. Do you have a reservation? No. No, I do not. But I was hoping maybe you had a vacancy? - You're in the right place. - Yeah. Come with me. This way. Thanks. Excuse me, sorry. I... What's your name? Jake Finley. Jake Finley. And how long will you be staying with us? That's a good question. Maybe a couple days? I'm here on a geological survey. Nice. Hello, I'm Walter. ...ers. Ers? Walters. Yes, I'm Walters-ers-ers. Mr. Walters is our handyman. Okay. Nice to meet you. And... and these are our guests. Clayton Warner, and my wife. Candace Lebeau. How do you do? Boy, I hope we pulled that... Box of Christmas lights out of the attic. Dad, this is our guest, Jake. Jake. Welcome, Jake. Let's show Jake the Fern Room. Two doors before the end. Check that. Let's put Jake in the Cedar Room. Up the stairs, right away at the end of the hall. It's got a much nicer view. Sure. All right, off we go. That's heavy. Yeah, it's tools of the trade, you know. Geologist and all. Let me take it. No, no. I've got it. Okay. Thank you for that candy cane, by the way. No problem. I sensed that you may have needed it a little bit more than me. Well, it was very nice but totally unnecessary. Well, isn't that the very definition of a gift? Fair enough. This is you, the Cedar Room. Okay. There you go. That's nice. Don't geologists get the holidays off? Not when we love what we do. How did you hear about us by the way? One of your little postcards off the rack at the tourist office. That's great. Okay, well, let me know if you need anything. Will do. Yes. I do need to know what's for dinner tonight, because I am starving. You know, chef Francesca is really creative, and I never quite know what she's going to whip up, so I guess it'll be a surprise. That's okay. Excuse me. Really? What? I make this for myself. It's cheap and does the trick. Cheap and does the trick isn't going to get dad a five-star rating. Could you have not at least tried to make something a little more... chef-y? I don't even know what that means. I just wish that you would've listened to me. This is why I didn't want you to be the chef. We could've brought in some good food. Like a schnitzel from the Pinewood Cottage Inn. Yeah, I mean... yeah. I just wish you would've listened to me. Well, you're not the boss of me anymore. I know that I'm not the boss of you anymore... Girls! Come on. Do you know what's for dinner? No. It's a surprise. Thank you. Sir? Well... Good evening. Tonight we will be serving a... Hearty, deconstructed, garden melange... thank you. With a, a bone broth? I had to throw it together last minute. Tomorrow's meal will be much better. Bon appetit. I love it. It's really tasty. It is pretty good. Mr. Warner. Great. Chef Francesca, why don't you join us? Don't mind if I do. Nice work. Who would like some wine? There you go. Enjoy. Good job. Thanks. Anybody for wine? - I'll have some. - Pass your glass. - Thank you. - Thank you. Looks great. So people say Paris is the most romantic city, but I'll take Buenos Aires. Remember that night? Mi amore. How could I forget? I never knew you could tango. So you are a geologist here for work? I am, yeah. I'm going to head up to Long Hill in the morning, collect some samples. Are you missing friends and family over the holidays? No, I don't have any brothers and sisters. But my parents retired in Germany, so I'm going to head to Berlin in a couple months to see them. Ooh, Berlin. Such a lovely city. Oh, you've been? Of course. What'd you think of Gendarmenmarkt? Genda men's market? Didn't we buy you some pants there? Gendarmenmarkt, that's the famous square, and it has the beautiful cathedrals, the German and the French? Right. But there was a little shop nearby that sold pants, remember? What brings you to Pinewood? Pinewood is... A magical place. It really has a charm all its own. Besides, Pinewood is home. For you, but not for me. For us, it's like a home away from home. Exactly. Ice cream a la Francesca? Is that, is that ready? Yeah, almost. What's in that? Whipped cream, chocolate sauce, and freshly chopped nuts. That sounds like a sundae. Oh, no. Not the way Francesca makes it. Yeah. I use freshly chopped nuts. That breaker's popped. I've been having trouble since the reno. Someone ought to fix it. Yeah. Someone oughta. Can I borrow that? Thank you. Jake, the breaker panel's in the Cedar Room. Do you mind if I go into your room? No, by all means. This is highly unusual. Hello? Surprise! Margo? Who are you? I'll just give you the outside tour. What's, what's happening? I'm sorry, I thought you were coming in tomorrow. I was going to call you. This is the Ralston Inn? I know. Dad is running a B&B now. What's gotten into him? I don't know, but we have to talk about that later, because right now, there's a critic in there who thinks we're all guests and you have to play along. We can say the truth about you that you're my grandma. And let everyone else have all the fun? Not likely. Grandma, please don't blow it. What, me? Blow it? Hello, everyone! Hi. I'm checking in. Margo Kovats. How do you do? Won't you join us for dinner? Thank you, thank you. Would you be a darling and please bring in my luggage? May I take your scarf? I seem to be a little late for this lovely party. Would you please get me a drink? Thank you. What are you doing? I'm just taking a... You like taking photographs, don't you? I do. It helps me with a little project of mine. So have you been here before? Yes. Place was different then. So are you staying through Christmas. Yes. You? Oh no, I'm headed to Maine to see some extended family. Do you have family nearby? They are very close by. Nice, so you'll be seeing them. Yeah. That's great. Well, I'll see you a little later, okay? You were going to make a difference with that, I... I know but the world's not going to miss another Poli-Sci major. That's exactly what you said when you switched from English to Sociology to Psychology. Okay, being undeclared is my comfort zone. That's ridiculous. You're a junior, you need to come up with a major. I just worry about you. Yeah, I know you do. Something will spark. We can't all be like you, Lucy. I don't want you to be like me. I want you to be you, but happier, with direction and stuff. Hi. Hey, isn't that our guest, Jake? Oh, yeah. You should go say hi. No, I don't want to bug him. Hey Jake! Hey. Hey. Alright, get me a cappuccino. Hey. What's going on, I thought you were on Long Hill today. I've already been there and back. Just inputting a little information. Okay. We're going to have a hot brunch if you want to join us, if you're around. You're sure? Yeah, you're our guest. Sure I'm sure. Never turned down a meal. That soup you made last night was really good. Thanks. Maybe you take after your mom. She was such a great cook. That's what I remember most about her. And every Christmas she would make that ham dish. That was so good. Good morning everybody. - Here you go. - Thank you. Enjoy. Thank you. It tastes better than it looks. I should hope so, darling. This is delicious. Yeah, this is really good. I like it. And after brunch, I would like to invite everybody outside for a little Christmas tradition. Sounds fun. - Hey. - Hey, how are you? Good, you? I'm just going to grab a few things. Help yourself. Okay, are we waiting for Candace? No, she said she had to run an errand in town. Well, that's too bad. All right, so every Christmas, the Ralston family likes to get together to build a snowman. This year, we'd like to invite our guests to join us. This sounds like fun. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Let's... let's go build that snowman. Snowman building it is. Alright. Some right here. How long you been working at the Ralston Inn? Seems like my whole life. Be careful. Here comes the head. Let me help you with that. No, no, no, I got it! Let me do it! You OK? No, no, no, no, no. Let Jake help her. Yeah! Here let me help ya. I got you. OK, come on. Alright, guys, I got it. I'm OK-no! Oh! Jeez! Come on. We're going to get you inside. Put some ice on it. - This is so embarrassing. - Come on. Get some ice on there. Okay. I don't know if this is necessary. You want it to heal? This'll speed it up. Okay. Okay. Give me your foot. Yes sir. It's going to be tender, but just for a sec. Okay. I'm sorry. All right. My mom was a nurse, so I picked up a thing or two. What did your dad do? He was career military. Is that why they're in Germany? Yeah. They loved it so much they decided to stay. How about you guys? How long you been doing the B&B thing? Ah, gee. Well, it's new. It's really new, actually. This is my childhood house. I grew up here. And now it's not my home anymore, but it's okay. My dad is really happy, and I'm just getting used to it. Good for you. Okay, you hold this on here. I'm going to fix you some tea. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Here we go. Thank you. If you want a scarf, you should use a real one. You know we've got a whole box of old winter stuff in the closet. You can use anything you can find. Yes, Mr. Ralston. In one of the closets in the house. I'll go get that. Right now. Her temperament is the key to her culinary success. Dad's ancient camcorder. Okay. I'm not ready, I'm not ready. Ted, what are you doing? I just want to make sure this camera works properly, and I know how to use it before the kids wake up in the morning. Really? You're not just looking for a reason to not cut up the sweet potatoes? That too. Okay, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Amber, is your daddy a slacker? Is he a slacker? I haven't even done my hair this morning. I'll get that. It's just me and you, kiddo. It's just me and you. Can I have a cracker? Mommy loves you. Mommy loves you, baby girl. I love you so much. Yeah. Hi, mom. Hey, who's out here? What are you doing? Oh, gosh! What is up with you and candy canes? What's up with you sneaking around? Not so much sneaking as grabbing some dry firewood. Got to stay warm somehow. Sorry, I'm sorry. I heard a noise. I'm sorry, I'll leave you be. It's okay. How's your ankle? It's better, apparently. See? The ice worked. That is spectacular. Look at that. Yeah, it really is. You know actually, as a teenager I would come out here in the middle of the night and just do this. Just stare at the sky and take it all in. Really. I used to do the same thing. Really? Yeah. Yeah, when I was a kid, I'd get used to living in one place and the military would have us move to another place, and so the stars were always... They were always so steady and constant for me. Don't you travel for work now as a geologist? Yeah, all the time. That's interesting. You chose a career that doesn't give you what you were looking for in the first place. In the stars. I never thought of it like that. It's very philosophical. Yeah, sorry. I'll send you my bill. Doctor Lucy. Yeah, I don't know what to say about that. I guess it's in my blood. What are you... What are you looking for on Long Hill? Researching some iron deposits. You know what those are? Nope. Nope. It's, it's stardust. Yeah, iron is only created when giant stars explode. It's in everything. It's in mountains, trees, you, me. So we really are all made of stardust. Yes, we are. You hear that, mama? I'm a star. You definitely are. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that you have to spend your Christmas with some random family. And our guests. What are you talking about? This has been... this has been amazing. It's very homey. I was actually going to thank you and your dad. Well, in that case, you're welcome. You have siblings? I do. I do. I have two younger siblings. Names? Will and Amber. Will and Amber. Are they coming for the holidays? They're close and should be here soon. What about your mom? She passed when I was 15. I'm sorry. Thanks. Yeah. She was my steady and constant. I think actually, the stars became that for me as well after she died. That's beautiful. So, military brat. What was that like? Military brat? Well, I don't know about that, more of just an all-around brat, brat. I was a handful. Did you get into a lot of trouble? And I'm standing in the snow, bawling my eyes out, and suddenly I hear somebody drive by in the distance with the radio blaring. And guess what song was playing? Elvis's Blue Christmas. Of course. I don't know, it's just always stuck with me. It's made me break into a million pieces. I just couldn't stop laughing for like 20 minutes. And I think from that point forward, ever since I heard that song, I just knew everything's going to be okay. That's a great story. - Wow. - Oh, god. What time is it? I don't know. It's, it's pretty late, probably. We should probably get some sleep. Probably should. Maybe? Coffee, light cream, one sugar. Seems your transition from Park Ranger to Bed and Breakfast proprietor has been a smooth one. Some parts smoother than others. But now you know my story, what's yours? I'm retired also. Used to teach English at New York City college. New York City must be very exciting. I think my husband liked it more than me. Husband? He passed five years ago. I'm sorry. Thanks. Well, he loved the city. Me, I like it out here where I can just really be myself. Well, we certainly hope you'll stay as long as you want. In the meantime, I have to go and get a tree with my daughter Lucy. So if you need anything, please help yourself. Thank you. Hey, can I come brush my teeth? Yeah, come on in. Thanks. I heard you were up pretty late last night. Who told you? I heard you. We were just talking. We were. Hey, your blog is doing really great, huh? 200,000 followers and growing. And you and Will are about to go on this adventure around the world? Yeah, Will's really excited about that. Are you not? I was, but I... But what? I've been thinking about starting a... a family. Wha... Have you told Will about this yet? Not yet. Okay. There's no time like the present. I guess. Okay, here's what I think. My brother has always wanted to travel. But he loves you more than anything. Just talk to him. It's going to work out. Okay. You look really pretty, by the way. I should hope so. It's what I do. Yeah. You know what I mean. Hi. Hello. Figured we could use some help with the tree. Jake graciously volunteered. Great. Here, let me get in the back. No, no. Stay, stay, stay. Okay. Let's go get a tree. Well? It's lopsided. You think? Trust me. Lopsided. She knows what she wants. Always has. So she mentioned she used to help a lot with her brother and sister. Yeah. She had to grow up fast. Well, some kids rebel when that happens. Well, the only thing I worried about Lucy was that she was worrying too much about the rest of us. Hey! What about this one? That's a good one. Yeah, I'm looking forward to it, too. Grandma, what did she say? She's telling them that she's staying. Bye-bye. My dad's going to be so... She's going to stay, great. Cookie? Thank you. Those looks great. You're welcome. - Special delivery. - It's here. It smells so good? Where do you want this? Just here, here. Just in this like this little space right here. Okay, okay. Cookie? Oh, yes. Look! It looks so good! It's beautiful. Isn't it? Mr. Ralston, Beth has decided to stay another night. You run such a nice Inn, I thought I would soak it in a little more. That is great news, I'm glad to hear it. I can't find the Christmas decorations. Thank you. And we should decorate. We should decorate. You're going to have to do it without me. I'm not going to have time to run into town, set up a Santa stand, get back, get my suit on. Let me do it, let me help you. I'll set up the stand. You're playing Santa? All the more reason why he shouldn't be the one to set up the stand. I will do it, I'll take your pickup truck, and you can use my car whenever you're ready. I can take him. Kind of like to see you as Santa. Ho, ho, ho! Great. It gives me more time to decorate. Let's do it together. Yeah, the whole family! Because, when you're a guest at the Ralston Inn, you're automatically a member of the family. Count me in. Eggnog? All right. Yay! Good job everybody. It's beautiful, beautiful. All right. I'm going to set up your stand. Thank you. Need some help? Don't you have to go over to Long Hill? Long Hill will be there tomorrow. Okay, great. Come on. See you guys later. Here's to one more. This is a lot more work than I thought it was going to be. Yeah, apparently Santa needs a big advance team. Thank you for your help. Yeah, sure. I gotta take this. Yeah, yeah, go ahead. Hey, what's up? Hey boss. I haven't received your review on the Ralston Inn yet. Yeah, sorry. I've been a little delayed. Are you moving on to the next one? No, not quite yet. I need to spend a little... A little bit more time here. That's not like you. I know. Okay, perfect. Yeah, great. Okay, talk to you soon. All good? Yeah, yeah, I just got granted access to Ore Hill in Salisbury. Well, congratulations. Thank you. Hi, sweetheart. What are you doing? Planning Christmas dinner. I'm missing some ingredients though. What's gotten into you? I just want it to be perfect. You have really embraced the chef's role. Yes, I have. Remember this? That was your mother's favourite. Ho, ho, ho. Make yourself comfortable there. That's good. That's got an interesting flavour to it. Mr. Donahue's finest. Lucy, how are you doing? Merry Christmas, Mr. Bishop. Hi. Rick, this is Jake. Rick Bishop runs the Pinewood Cottage Inn. Nice to meet you. How you doing? Good, thank you. Are you going to meet your brother and sister? I haven't seen them in town. No, they're-they're coming later. Big surprises with your dad converting the house into a B&B? Yeah. I mean, how's he doing that? He must be short staffed. No, he's great. Everything's great. Actually, I was just going to show Jake around, but I'd love to talk with you later okay? OK. Have a great one. Bye. Nice to meet you. Down that alley and around the corner is the old Pinewood Train Station, and the whole interior is made out of... Let me guess. Pine. How could you possibly have known? And then down this road a little ways is the Pinewood Pine Museum. - More pine. - More pine. And then over here is, they've got the world's largest selection of pine... Let me guess. Pine scented products. Yes. How did you know? Pine scentral, get it? Because it's central. Ho, ho, ho. Looks like you need a hand. I think I need two smaller ones. You know, I'm... I'm a little nervous about playing Santa. Really? Yeah. You're so kind and generous and jovial. You sure you're not the real deal? Well, now let's do something about Santa's stomach. Let's try this. Here we go. Okay. Make some room. This looks great. Suddenly, visions of sugarplums are dancing in my head. Five o'clock, better get going. Right. Okay, that's the town tour. That's great. I love the... Well, well, well! Oh, my gosh. You look great! I had some help from my elf here. This is such a quaint little town. It is, isn't it? This looks fantastic, Luce. You did a great job. Thank you. I did have a little help. I had some help from my elf. What am I, chopped liver over here? I wanted to ask you. Where could I get some stationery? I got you covered. Pine scented or regular? I have a choice? Inside joke. Come on. OK. I'll show you. So. What do you think? Ho, ho, ho. As a branding professional, I have to say this is the epitome of Christmas. Thank you. So, what do you want for Christmas, young lady? I would like to save our family home. You know, fathers are supposed to set an example for their kids. Look at what I've got my kids doing. All for a good review. It's okay. We're all having fun. No one's getting hurt. You're the most honest man I know, and as a father and an innkeeper, you deserve five stars. And there's no deception in that. Thanks. Wait, what about us? You can't go. Why do we have to miss the Christmas festival? Because, Mr. Clayton Warner, if somebody in town recognizes you as Will Ralston, Bea Turner's going to be there and the jig is up. I was really looking forward to the festival. I'm sorry, grandpa. Why don't we just try and stay away from her? No. It's a really small town. There's too much at stake. Please. Do we have an understanding? Skootch it over, skootch it over. Are you okay? I'm fine. Do you want to talk? Not now. I'm just a little tired. Do you know what'd lift your spirits? The Christmas festival. But Lucy said no. I love my sister, but she can be a control freak. I really want to go. You would? I think we can keep a low profile. Where are you going? I... I have to... You want me to wait five minutes for you to make up something? Or do you want to tell me the truth? The truth is, I don't know how many more Christmas festivals I have left. And... I don't want to miss this one. Well. Someone responsible is going to have to keep an eye on you. Okay. Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas. What's your name little girl? Sophia. Sophia, have you been a good girl this year? Yes. I'll take that as a no. Ho, ho, ho. No, no, no, no, no! Hi, Mr. Bishop. How's it going again. Hey, I heard a rumour that Bea Turner is in town. Yeah, I heard that too. Uh-oh. Why uh-oh? Isn't that your sister Amber over there? That really looks like her, doesn't it? No, she's not home. But Bea Turner. You know, her last review is from Milford. No kidding. So it's true. She's in the area. I wonder if she's going to your place. Bye. Bye! I'll be right back. She's going to find out, and she's angry. I know, but it's all going to be... What are you guys doing here? You know, just keeping a low profile. Come on. You're not. Because Rick Bishop almost saw you and he's standing near Bea. Where'd he run off to? He think that Bea's going to his place. It doesn't matter. You guys, please. Will, I know this is not how you want to spend your Christmas, but I'm begging you to go home. She's right, Will. Let's go. Thank you, Suzanne. - I'm sorry. - Fine. Thank you. Sorry. Where's Amber? Hey. Hi. Did I just hear you call them Will and Suzanne? Them? I don't want to lie to you. Listen, Beth isn't Beth. She's Bea Turner. She's a Bed and Breakfast critic. And she's incognito. Really? Yeah. So her review can make or break my dad's place, and I didn't want the Ralston Inn to seem like it was empty and staff-less. Have you heard of her? No. Well, anyway. Clayton isn't Clayton. He's my brother Will, and Candace Lebeau is his wife, Suzanne. And chef Francesca is my sister, Amber. And Margo? My grandmother. And Mr. Walters? My grandpa. That makes a lot of sense now. Does it? Yeah. And I hate to do this, but now I have to ask you to not tell my family that you know, and please play along. I'm sorry. Please. That depends. Are you actually Lucy? I am. Just as I thought, I'm out of star anise. But I need it for a recipe. Maybe you can substitute for something else. No, I can't. It's a special recipe. I'm sorry, Amber. Hang on. What are you doing? I add star anise to my cocoa. There's not much left. But it's enough. Can I buy it from you? No. But I can give it to you. Thank you, Mr. Donahue. Merry Christmas. There's so many lovely gifts and sweets. I know, are you going to pick anything up? Well you know, my cousins love holiday fruitcake. Where can I get that? Actually right here, Mr. Donahue's... But he's closed, so the next place that sells good fruitcake is... There on the corner of... Okay. Hey, Margo, hi! Hi Margo, what a surprise. Yes, well darling. I thought I'd stretch my legs a little in town. You headed back now? I will, as soon as I find Mr. Walters. He's here too? With me. But when I turned, he was gone. We'll probably run into him. Help me. Here let me help you find him. Let's go. Why don't we relax in here? Okay. Okay everyone, the moment that you've been waiting for. The winner of our ugliest Christmas sweater ever contest is... Walter! Hey Walter, There you go! Merry Christmas, Walter. Merry Christmas. - That was too funny. - Oh, my gosh. We couldn't find him anywhere. - We did. - He was in the contest. He must fancy himself a showman. Hey, Beth, come and join us. Thank you, Mr. Claus. Are you going to talk to me? Yeah, I'm just trying to figure out how to tell you. Tell me what? I'm pregnant. And I know you want to travel the world, and I do too. But I want to start a family. You're pregnant? And I couldn't be happier. And now I'm going to go be happy in the bathroom. You have a very beautiful voice. Thanks. You don't sing? No Christmas carolling for you? No, no, no, no. Why? No, I do not like to sing. Especially not in public. What if there's like, 30 other people doing it? You want 30 people to leave? I do not like drawing attention to myself. Well, I hate to tell ya, with a face like that you're drawing attention everywhere you go. Excuse me, you trying to tell me something? Nothing you don't already know. Oh, yeah? Might this happiness be tied to a certain handsome guest? Maybe. Grandma, he travels for a living. There's no future in that, right? When your mom first started dating your father, he was an unemployed history major living in a camper. I told her, there's no stability in that man. Grandma! My point is, people surprise you. You should follow your heart. It worked for your mom. What are you going to tell your guests when they ask you why I am doing this with you? Oh, well, we'll just tell them I'm helping you wrap gifts for your royal family. Dad runs a full service B&B. Careful dad, lift with your legs. Hey. Here. I was the one that taught you that. You were, you're right. Sorry. I could tell you had fun last night. I did. I don't think I've seen you that happy in a woman's company since... Annie. You're right. So you going to do something about it? She's a big time writer with her website, and... I haven't exactly been truthful with her. Well, yep. That's got to change. You're right. Remember what I told you when you first started seeing Annie? Yeah. Say it. When it comes to love, reach for the stars. Life and love, son. You got to reach for it. Oh dear. Oh dear. What are you reading? A "what to expect when you're pregnant" article. What are you... It is my turn to talk. Okay. Yes, I wasn't expecting this. Yes, I want to travel the world and yes, I want to live an unconventional life. Well, I guess I don't need an article. You're laying it all out for me. But what I want most in this life is a great adventure. And I can think of no greater adventure than having a baby with you. - Really? - Really. Who says we have to do it like the rest of the world. We'll do it our way. Yeah. Our world didn't get smaller, it just got a lot bigger. And it's going to be fantastic. - Hi. - Hi. Is taffy almost ready? Yeah, almost. I haven't seen this box in ages. I know, I missed it. Oh, my gosh, do you remember that? Yes. Look at the peanut butter and jelly grilled cheese. That was my favourite. What else smells good? You're cooking something else, what is it? - Yeah. - It smells so good. Yeah, I'm prepping Christmas dinner. Okay. Do you want to go get Jake? I'm almost done with the taffy. Yes. Okay. Well, it's a shame that you're leaving, Beth. We certainly have enjoyed your company. It's been so nice. These peppermint snowball cookies that Francesca made are so good. Yes they are. Mr. Ralston. Have you heard the news that Beth is departing? Really? I've had such a great time. I wish I didn't have to go. Well, you can't go before the taffy. Chef Francesca has it all ready, so... Hello? Hello, can I come in? Yeah. Of course. - Hi. - Hi. You're been holed up here for a while. Yeah, I'm just getting some work done. Getting those pressing deadlines out of the way. A lot of work. Well, taffy's ready, and taffy can't wait. So come on! So this butter is for your fingertips so that the taffy doesn't stick to your fingers. That's it. So I'm going to pass this around. Okay. Now, with your partner... There you go. Grab the taffy, like so. You share this with your partner, then you stretch from the center, fold it over, and pull the taffy, pull it to the middle, getting the air into the taffy. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how you pull taffy. Let's get to it. All right! What happened? Breaker again. I'll go flip the switch. Here, do you mind if I go in your room? Yes, absolutely. Lucy. Please be fair when you write your review. Lucy, I'm sorry. I don't even know what to say right now, because I don't want to jeopardize my father's review anymore than I already have. What if I tell you that anything you say to me right now is not going to have any bearing on the review? I told you I thought Beth was Bea Turner and you didn't correct me. You just let me continue to think that. Why? Why weren't you honest with me? Honest? You mean like, how you were with this whole charade? That's... that's not the same. I'm trying to save my family home here. You knew the whole truth and you kept it from me. Trust me, I wanted to tell you. But you didn't. You told me you were a geologist, and then you kissed me under false pretences. That's not fair. That is not fair. I mean, maybe you're used to lying wherever that you go, but I'm not. Writing reviews for B&Bs is my livelihood. I can't get a proper bearing on a place if they know who I am. But you jeopardized your ability to get a proper reading on this place because you got involved with me. I didn't plan on getting involved with you. But you did. Yes, I did. You're right. But I still got a job to do. So do I just check out now? I don't know, moving on is in your blood, right? So you all thought I was Bea Turner? You were taking so many photographs. So why all the pictures? Well, I'm doing a remodel and I love what you've done with this place. So you were just getting ideas? Yeah. I should take it as a compliment. Well, you should. You have a good eye. I wonder if Jake will give us a one-star review. We don't know that he's going to trash this place. Well we tried fooling him into thinking we're people we're not, and he fell for Lucy who kicked him to the curb. I didn't kick him to the curb. He said he was going to leave and I didn't stop him. Well, at least now we can stop all the deception. Amber. Well, it was fun while it lasted. It certainly was, darling. What's going on? I haven't been able to figure out what I want to do with my life. I know. Something will come to you. It has... Culinary school. Culinary school? What do you think? Well, the food you've made has been fantastic. I feel a real connection to cooking. Like mom. Yeah. Yeah, like mom. I want you to follow your dream. And if your dream is to be chef Amber, then I am all for it. Thanks, dad. I'm proud of you, kiddo. And I always will be. So there you are. How's Amber? Amber, she's great. How are you? I'm sorry, dad. For what? You might lose the house. Sweetheart, I'll be fine. I hope I didn't mess things up for you. I really hope I didn't mess things up for you. What do you mean? You and Jake. You two seem to have clicked. Dad, that whole thing was built on a lie. I don't even know how much of that was real. Yeah, well, that's not what I saw. And as a very wise man once told me, life and love, you gotta reach for it. If I were a critic, I would give rave reviews to this beautiful Inn and your wonderful service. Well to be honest, I'm rather glad you're not a critic. Why? Because it would seem a little odd to ask a critic to be our guest for a little while longer. My cousins are expecting me in Maine. They have the same old, same old Christmas. I can't disappoint. My cousins aren't half as entertaining as your family. But it's just your family here now. Wouldn't that be odd? Beth, I... I think I misspoke when I said "our guest." I meant, I'd like you to stay as my guest. And I wasn't fussing over you because I thought you were Bea Turner. I like you and I'd like to get to know you more. Can I use your phone? I still don't have reception here. Sure, come on in. Hey bam-bam. Hey woozy, where are you? I'm in town, just wandering. Listen, my friend who works at the Pinewood Cottage Inn said Jake checked in last night. He's still here? Yeah, well, what are you going to do about it? Mr. Donahue, did you get a new shipment of those sassafras candy canes. I sure did. Now you can have your pick. Great. I'll take them all. Now don't eat those all at once. They're not for me. Thank you! I have to pay you. Actually, can you just put it on our tab? Bye! You don't have a tab. You want to help me out here? I'm totally out of my comfort zone, okay? I'm sorry. I'm sorry too. I'll have to check. That weekend is filling up. "A once-in-a-lifetime experience." "When you stay at the Ralston Inn, "you become a family member!" "The food is extraordinary." "The decor first class." "With warm and unique characters." You must be talking about me, right? Obviously. With a five-star review, I'm going to have to hire more staff. I'm available. All the presents are out from under the tree. Hey, hey, hey. Are we going to open up the rest of this stuff? What does this say? To Beth from somebody named Ted. What? When did you sneak out for this? That's beautiful. What do we have here? You didn't? It's not much. This is perfect. I love it. You can stop taking pictures. Here you go. What's this? A gift certificate. Dinner for two of schnitzel. From the Pinewood Cottage Inn. I hope they have bratwurst too. Thanks, dad. I love you, bam-bam. This was tucked away. For me? Just a little last minute something. You know the way to a man's heart, sassafras. Home sweet home. Dad... I saved it from the Reno. You're going to make me cry. Thank you so much. I love you. I love it. And I do love our new home. Merry Christmas! What? I knew it! Yes! Really? That's great! Congratulations! That is great news! Congratulations! Come here. Congratulations. I'll tell you what, if I knew Amber could cook like this, I would... Yeah, you did all this? Certainly beats what my cousins serve. You guys ready for the main dish? - Yeah. - Yes. Oh, please, bring it. Star anise and orange glazed ham. That's exactly what mom used to make for Christmas dinner. I know. It's her recipe. Your mother would be so proud. Everyone, I just want to say thank you to you and your alter egos... ...for having me here this Christmas. It is so special and truly one of the most memorable that I've ever had. I'd like to make a toast. To those who are gone, to those who are here, and to those who are on the way. This will always be home. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, grandpa! RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM
