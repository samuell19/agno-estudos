So what do you say, Viviane, darling? Why call us over, if you're going to be stubborn about it?! What for? Meir, cool it down! You want to hit her?! Go ahead, hit her! It's all out of kindness! You must learn how to give up. Just go and look at yourself in the mirror. You used to be beautiful, now you're in the dumps. A wife can't just get up and leave her husband like that. She just can't, Viviane! It's not like he ever did anything to you. What did he ever do to offend you, the poor guy? Think they'll give you a divorce just like that at the rabbinate? You're gonna regret this, you'll see! Mark my words: You are going to regret this. He's absolutely right, Viviane. An abandoned wife, that's how you're gonna end up. And an abandoned wife is no better than a childless wife. Where did you ever see a disobedient wife acting like this? It?ll all come back to haunt you! What do you want from him? Doesn't hit you, doesn't drink. Doesn't gamble, and doesn't fool around. Helps around the house, goes to work everyday. Gives you his paycheck every month. He loves you. He loves you, the poor man! Viviane, if you only knew how other folks live... You'd kneel down every day to kiss his hands and feet. You want to meet with Rabbi Haim tomorrow? Hear what he has to say. What is this?! What's all this then? She doesn't love him, she doesn't want to live with him, and you just won't stop pushing her, and pushing her! Finally we're getting through to her, and you go ruin it?! We're not in Morocco any more! Give her a break! Let her leave! It's not up to you! - What do you mean, not up to me?! Let her be! Help her! Keep on hollering, whatever... - Get a load of him... No, I won't go! Instead of helping her, what do you do?! I don't care about the neighbors! You want your sister to be divorced? You and your hypocrisy, as if you all have perfect marriages! What's this disrespect?! Listen to yourself! Go, get out of here. That's all we needed; you, mouthing off. Get! Go on, get lost! Leave him alone... Got quite a mouth on him, the little squirt. That's all we need. Quite a mouth you got on you. That's all we need now. He's crying. - Who cares. Feeling bad for his sister. We feel bad, too. We love her, too! Viviane, Eliyahu is a very well respected man; everybody looks up to him in synagogue. You've got 4 young children to raise and discipline. Just how are you going to do that on your own, huh? You should be happy with what you've got. You're not a spoilt child, darling. Enough with that. All we have is our poor mother. Just look at her. Unless you want to finish her off, you go make up with your husband. Mother's ill. You don't want that on your conscience. Go ahead, be humble about it, give him some respect. Go on, he's waiting for you. Don't let her girlfriends get to her. Go on, sis, get up. Put this whole mess behind you. - Go on, up you go. It's 01:30 in the morning... - Enough already. Go make up with your husband. Unless you want tonight to go on. Tell you what, you get up tomorrow morning, go buy yourself a new skirt or a new dress. You put it on, have some fun and put it out of your mind. Go on, sis, enough already. - 20 years you've been married. Where would you find another one like him? She won't stop smoking. 4 packs since this morning. 4 packs, that's enough. Enough already. Go on, get up. Get rid of the ghosts. Dad, God rest his soul, if he were alive we'd have none of this grief. Enough already... And how Dad loved Eliyahu. Do it for your children. Enough with this whole thing. - No more crazy business. Go on, he's waiting for you. Go on, put out your cigarette. Put it out, now. Go on, up you go. Go on, Viviane. Take his hand. We're all exhausted here. Go on, Eliyahu, give her a kiss, now. Is this gonna take all night? Make the first move. I would kiss her, but she doesn't want to. Come on, Eliyahu, would, could, should... There's your wife. Hold her, give her a kiss. And put all of this behind you. Go on, Viviane. Enough already. Whatever you want, Viviane. It'll be OK, you'll see. Thank God already... Mazal tov! - Reunited, thank God. We'll have ourselves a good Shabbat dinner. And I'll dance around in my undies, as long as it'll make you two happy. My neighbor, he says: I'll take care of the spice, you bring the steak. Right, good night to you all. Thought we'd have to stay here till dawn. Thank God it turned out OK. And she sings there all day long, and she composes her own song... A tiny songbird in my heart... A tiny songbird in my heart... You done brushing your hair? - Nope. Come have a cup of tea. Had one! Fine. Nice, my boy... Oh, mom... Valentino, Valentino, who would ever have thought... Viviane, get up. It's almost 10 past six. Vivi, get up. It's 10 past six. - Alright. I'm up, I'm up, Eliyahu. Coming... Lior, Eviathar, get up! Viviane, it's 7 AM. Wake up! - Oh, door's locked... Can't find the key. Lior has a key. - Thanks, Dona. Eviathar, Lior, get up! Lior, Eviathar, cherie, wake up. Wake up, baby. When are you going to fix that alarm clock?! Yeah, OK. Where are the house keys, baby? Good morning, baby. Where d'ya put them? What do you want me to fix you for lunch? Nothing. - Lior, cut it out, I'll give it back to you. Don't get on my nerves, now. You want to open it yourself? Eviathar, you get dressed. Come on, come here. Give me the keys! - "The war of the keys"... Yeah, "war of the keys". Enough already! Give it here! Lior, you come open the door! - Mom! Where's my math notebook?! Where's my math notebook?! - What, darling? Math notebook? Yeah, my math notebook?! Are you deaf?! Wait, I lost my contact. Be right there. Where's my notebook?! I told you to stop cleaning up my room! What color is it? - Blue! Thin or bulky? - A notebook! Get it?! I told you not to touch my stuff! I'm coming! I'm coming! What's the matter, honey? - I want my notebook right now! What is it? I don't know where you put it. You put your stuff in your schoolbag last night? - Yeah. Let's look for it, then. Hang on. Wait, is it this one? - No. This? Blue, I said! Blue! This is red! I never touch your stuff, I just clean here! Don't get mad, because I won't find it unless you help. So was it around here or... - There. I want the money I lent you, now! Cut it out, honey. Come on. Right. I'll get your money. Lior! - What's this doing here?! Hang on... I'm getting it! Hang on... There. Did you find your notebook? - No, and I want all my money! Don't get upset, baby, OK? You're already late. Get up, now. Lior? Gabrielle? Wake up! Where are you? Come here, let's get dressed for school. Dona? Dona? - Huh? Can you spare a 10 till noon? Fifty's all I got on me. - Got change? No, I haven't got any. - Ok, thanks. Lior? Gabrielle? Cut it out! You're driving me nuts here! Enough! I can't take this anymore. That's not nice! Come on, let's get dressed. Come on, put this on. There, I found a few more shekels for you. Did you look through your bag? - I'm not speaking to you. Why, baby, what have I done? I hate this house, and I hate this family! Fine. You looked already? Want me to help? There, thank God, isn't that what you were looking for? Isn't it? Answer me, is that it? Eviathar! Come on! But I made you a chocolate sandwich! What's wrong with him? Has he eaten? - No. Milk's cold and I couldn't find the matches. It's fine, feed him. - What, cold?! - Yeah, cold. You just don't care, huh... - It's fine the way it is. Lior... There you are... What's this? What did you do to the alarm clock?! Do you know what dad's gonna do to us now? Huh? You and your games! What's dad gonna do to us? Let's go. Gabrielle! Gabrielle, make some sandwiches for you guys! Go on, baby... - I don't wanna go to school! I don't wanna go to school! - But you have to. - Don't wanna! Let me put on your shirt already! Enough of that! You're doing this on purpose. Who's mama's little sweetheart? Gabrielle! Go answer the door! Enough of this, cherie... Enough, I said! Enough! Good morning. Is Lior ready? There you go, put on a smile. Tzipora's here! Here are your lovely friends, see how happy they are? Give me his bag, Gabrielle. Put on a smile... Come on... Go on, take your bag. What, don't I get a kiss? That's better... Give me a hug... Stingy with the hugs, huh... Never mind. Your place at 9? 9:30 is better, I'm running a little late today. - OK. Thanks a lot, have a good day. Granny, hold him. I'm coming. So, car's out of the auto-shop, we can go to Tiberias on Saturday. You guys are coming, right? I already booked us a bungalow. It's up to Viviane. I don't know what she's got planned. Why the attitude? Stop eating pork, then I'll speak to you. Pork, me? - Yeah. I'm eating pork? Good one! As if... me, pork... Good morning. Yes? Albert? Hi, Viviane. How are you? Where are you? Downstairs. You're in Israel? Yes, I just flew in this morning. Can I see you? Listen. I'm with a customer. I have loads of work. Come down for 5 minutes, I'm in my car. No, no, I can't. Should I call back in a while? I don't know. I have to go now. I must see you, Viviane. Where are you staying? - At the Continental. You want the number? - OK. 423665. So I'll call you in an hour or two, OK? Try calling two hours from now, OK? Two hours. So, how about it, Neta? The roots, Viviane, the roots... No one will notice. When your hair's clean and tidy, nobody's going to notice. Trust Viviane on that one. - Really, don't worry. There's no way I'd let you leave here if it were at all obvious. It can wait a couple of days, no problem. Swing by next week, we'll give you a dye when you've got the time, without rushing it. If you say so. You know I trust you. How much? 25, same as usual. Wait... Close your eyes, please. Great. There you go. Thanks. Viviane, I'm here. Got you a loaf of bread, on the counter, and a pack of salt. A quarter of a glass would have been enough, I forgot to ask Eliyahu for it. Never mind, got you a pack, give back a pack. How are you, Neta? - Hello there. Yvette, you're here? How are you? - Fine, yourself? Don't ask what they did to my place. It's a total mess, and right after the spring cleaning, too. Later... - Fine, I'm off, OK? - OK. I'm in a rush, Viviane. Thanks a bunch. You look ravishing! - Thanks, I'm just in such a rush... I'm walking her to the door, then I'll be right back, OK? Neta, I wanted to talk to you about something, and I didn't get the chance, with all the folks around... You know, I talked to Dede about the car loan the other day and he said I should talk to you about it. It's no big thing, just a... Swing by my office today between 4 and 5, we'll crunch the numbers. What, today? - Sure, we'll talk it over. You're so great! I've been planning on buying this little something for ages now. Come by the office, we'll talk. Thank you, thank you! Have a good day. Bye! Alone at last! For me? - Sure, drink up, dear. Listen, if she grants this loan... Like a dream come true, Yvette. - Don't worry, she will, dear. I'm not too sure about that. It's been only six, eight months since they gave us a loan for the paint job. I redid the kitchen... Come on, I'll rinse you. What, already? We hardly had any time to talk. - Later. Ain't got time today. Come on, baby. But I want a French twist for tonight. - Alright. No problem. Wait... There you go. You're so beautiful. Viviane, it's me. You got time for me? Sure, Gerti. When? - In 20, 30 minutes? Sure thing. Do my roots, I'll do the rest at home. Sure. And I got the dye, too. No. 7 and no. 32. Great. In 30 minutes? I'll make something for Titi and Araleh, and I'll be right down. Sure thing, Gerti. She talks an awful lot, that one. - It's a crazy day. Everybody's in a rush. Rivka from the 8th floor's getting married and they all need it now. May it go on like this your entire life. You know... - What? I can't find the money I hid in my bathroom. - No! I don't know what I should do, I swear. Nobody knew about it. Victor came home at 3 AM again. Lord knows where he's been. I'm sick of it. You know Katty, my upstairs neighbor, she told me her husband saw Victor going to Haim's kiosk with Ben Harush on Saturday night after synagogue. To go do his monkey business. I don't know what to do about him anymore. Are you listening to me? Yeah, yeah... You're out of it today. Where did you fly off to? - Sorry... I'm out of it. - What's going on? Albert called. You're kidding me. No. He's here? - Flew in this morning. Cut it out... You're going to see him? Well? You want to. - No, I don't think I will. I don't believe you. Cut it out... I can't seem to take a breath since morning. How long is he staying? I don't know, Yvette. Haven't got a clue. Granny, hold him. - Come here. Coming. Talk to you later. Finally went to sleep. Yeah, he did. - Good. If you want to make pasta, then do it now before Gerti comes. Wait, let me finish... I'm telling you: Now, before Gerti comes. If you want to, now's the time. - Let me finish first. Fine, never mind, so don't. So he tells me: Erase it! So I told him: No! You can't erase a new drawing with an old eraser. You gotta to use a new one. If you want to keep the client satisfied, it's gotta be clean. How much is an eraser, anyway? 5 cents, tops. Cheap bastard. The drawing got smeared, I had to draw a new one. Now I'll get bunions from holding the pen. It's not like he's compensating me for my crocked fingers! Never! Jamais de la vie! Hello. - Hello, Eliyahu. Everything OK? - Fine. You got bread? Dona got me a loaf already. You told me to get one, I got it. I do as I'm told. So we'll have 3 loaves. We like eating, thank God. Hey, mom. You OK? Fine, fine... Look at what your mother's doing here... Hello, Gerti. How's life? - Just great. Yourself? Can't complain, thank God. Thanks. I defrosted the chicken for today and then there's zucchinis. The kids are on their way. Eliyahu, your casserole dish was delicious. He wolfed it down! Viviane, as long as I'm here, could you do my ends, too? What's granny doing there, couscous? No; stellini. Lots of work. Takes hours. That I've gotta taste. You are a lucky one, Viviane. A husband that does the cooking. Not like mine, all he does is eat. Hear that, Viviane? I never said you couldn't cook. What's true is true: Eliyahu's cooking is something else. Nah, it's nothing. Just lunch; zucchinis... So how do you do it? See, Gerti, first I fry the chicken in oil, garlic and some curcum. Just a dash, though. - Yes. When it starts getting a little tan I add the zucchini. Then... Eliyahu, careful with the dye, don't let it fall in. What are you worried for? Always worried, that one... Then I turn down the heat, and cook for 20, 30 minutes. And then it gets this texture, just like a spread. - Got it. I'll try it. I really will. Is it spicy? OK, I did all your hair. Great, I'm off. I've got my own bun in the oven for Shabbat. Like you say, Eliyahu. Make sure you come back on time. - Sure thing. You have to talk to me like that in front of her? What's she gonna think? What's there to think? What did I say wrong this time? That I'd get hair-dye in the pot. You think I can't see you're holding hair-dye? It wouldn't have been your fault. It might've accidentally dripped. Right, I'll prepare the meat now. You make the fish. Could you help me with that? You know, Neta from the bank was here earlier. We spoke, she said it'll be OK. I'll go see her this afternoon. That, and the loan from the post office ought to be enough. What do you reckon? Yeah, sure. I hope we'll get the loan from the post office, but it's not for sure. Question is: Do we really need this right now, on top of the house payments? What do you mean house payments? We've got those for the next 25 years. We'll make do, just like everybody else. I'm sick of us bumming a ride like welfare cases whenever we need to go someplace. It's fine by me if you don't want to take driving lessons. I'm done begging. I'll take as long as I need and get my own license. I don't need any favors from anyone. What are you snapping at me for? What did I say this time? You didn't say anything. It's OK. Never mind. Say, what shall I tell Yvette about going to Tiberias? Tiberias? When? Next Friday, we'd be back by Saturday night. - On Shabbat? I don't know, Viviane. Really, I don't. I'm already missing work tomorrow to go to Beer Sheva... I can't skip work for two Fridays in a row. I can't. But we already said we'd go. - No, I said no such thing. Plus we'd have to arrange for an electric heating plate... How would we do that? - What electric heating plate?! What would we eat, then? Canned food, like everybody else. And granny? The neighbor offered to... - You go, I'll stay right here. I won't be going to the neighbor's, I'll stay here with the baby. All week long I haven't got time to eat like a normal person, and on Shabbat I have to eat out of a can? And where would I pray? - Big deal! So you'd skip one Shabbat at synagogue, big deal! Make an effort for your kids, make them feel like normal kids for once, out on a family vacation. We have a ride over there. You know, we don't get too many opportunities like that! Plus, it's half off! Hardly a bargain, Viviane. It's half off 'cause it's off season. What should I tell Yvette & Victor? - I dunno... You go, with the kids. Why not? Me and kids again? Alone, again? Enough! Come on, Eliyahu! You could use a break, too! Just a short one, come on, to perammulate a little bit! Perambulate. You're correcting my Hebrew now? Well, the neighbor isn't going to. "The awakening of the Hebrew Teacher!" Why on Shabbat? Why not on a week day? People work on week days, that's why not. Then let's go in the summer. Like we did two years ago, when we went up to the Galilee. Remember? It was a week day then. It's June, Eliyahu. It's already summer. And we went to the Galilee 4 years ago. - Two! June or no June, it's not summer yet. It's still winter, what can you do? What, you wanna rub it in? - What? How I had to beg until you said yes! Makes no difference whether it was 2 or 4 years ago, winter, summer. Enough with the cold shoulder, Eliyahu. You're doing this on purpose, on Shabbat of all days. You know how much it means to me, but you go and make plans anyway. I made plans?! They're not waiting around for me to make plans with them! They get to make their own plans, Eliyahu, and they're doing you and your kids a favor by cramming you in the car! Get that through your thick skull! - You heard me asking for favors? Oh, never mind, I get it. I'll go alone, like a widow. Same as always. Can't you understand what I'm saying? I don't want to. Don't want to go on vacation with them. Period, I don't want to. Victor is jealous of me, gives me the evil eye each time I read the Book at synagogue! It physically pains him to see me acting as cantor! And his wife... She's worse! With her evil eye. Eliyahu, you better put a sock in it. I'm telling you, you better put a sock in it. Again with the foul mouth? Watch your mouth! I'm telling you to watch it! - What did I say? Just you watch it. That's all. I mean it! Gerti! I'm burning up! - I was wondering where you were! I was baking the cake there, and lost track. I hope I didn't burn! It hurts! - Sit down, relax, it's OK. It'll be alright. Viviane! - What? - Come over here, please. Wait, I'll be right with you. What is it?! The dye's burning her scalp, happy? What. - Just so you don't forget: You're putting me in a very awkward position with Yvette and Victor. Eliyahu, unless you want to make it worse, just shut up. We'll finish making lunch for the children, and that's all. You're not going to answer that? - She's burning up! You answer! Probably one of your customers. - Viviane! I'm burning! Come here! Yes? Hello? Who's there? Are you coming? I'm coming. Eat, darling. Eat up. Good boy. You're not eating? - Not hungry. Not hungry, huh. - What is it you want, Viviane? I ate a pita an hour ago! I'm not hungry, that's all. - Fine, fine. Who's my handsome little man? Eviathar! Come, lunch! Come! Don't wanna. You too, eat! What's with you today? Is that a teddy bear? Lior? What is it, love? A tummy ache again. Eliyahu, pour him some milk. - Milk? He just had meat! The child's in pain. Give him milk, it's the only thing that helps. I'm not giving him milk after he just had meat. He hasn't touched his chicken! Barely a piece or 2 of zucchini... And there's no meat in the zucchini dish? - He didn't have any! That's YOUR education. We'll see how they'll turn out! There you go, drink up, and go use the toilet in half an hour. Go, lie down in Granny's room. Until you can go, OK, baby? He's right, you know. Remember this, Viviane: You started it this time! Eliyahu, do me a huge favor and leave me alone, OK? Just leave me alone. Come, come. Eliyahu, the towel, please? Thanks. So, what's the conclusion? - Regarding? Tiberias. What do I tell Yvette? Again with this story? Dunno, Viviane, do whatever you like. So you're not coming with us? Now you're turning the kids against me? I'm exhausted. - Me too, Viviane. I hadn't had a moment's peace ever since I got home. - Fine. Zucchini dish, granny? - No. Salad? - No. You didn't eat a thing. Wait in my room and get your notebooks out. You see, love... I want to come with you, but I can't. It's Shabbat. See, my love, Shabbat... It's a great thing. It's a privilege! We don't keep traditions at all, so at least the Shabbat. Now she's off telling her friends that I won't let my children go on vacation. Is that any way to behave? She's doing it on purpose, and why? To turn you guys against me. Just like last week. I had the audacity of telling her she was late from her card game, and she wouldn't cook for a week and gave me hell. So there you have it, little girl. Now you know. But you already knew that. You see everything. OK, angel. Don't let it get you down. Right, love? My my, time to head back to work. She doesn't understand that she's hurting you, her kids. You do your homework, OK? You're certain you had no homework in biology? No. Hebrew? Math? - No. Give me your class phone list. If I find so much as one assignment you'll be doing all these assignments here, locked here until 7 PM! I swear, they didn't give us any homework today. We'll call Sivan and ask her. Give me the class phone list. 3, 4, 7... Only in biology. - Only in biology? 3, 6... And one math exercise. So why did you lie? So why did you lie?! Show me what they gave you! And you're doing all of it, for lying to me. Lior, were are you? Lior, why did you lock the door? What's wrong? Everything OK, baby? Are you going? Yes. Great. Want me to wipe it for you? No. Call Gabrielle if anything's the matter, OK? OK. Gabrielle... Again with the clothes cabinet? Listen, cherie, I have to go. Ela will come by at 5 o'clock. If I'm running late, tell her to wait for me. And check on Lior, OK? Come, lock the door behind me. Hey, Yvette. No, I was going out. Yeah, wait... Darling, go do your homework. And enough with the cabinet, OK? So lock the door behind me. Go on, darling. Yeah. Oh, I don't know. I guess I will. Yeah, Eliyahu answered so he hung up. Listen, babe, I've got to rush off to the bank, I'm late. Let's meet up at Ita's. Talk to you later. Bye, darling. Kisses. Ciao. Gabrielle, lock the door. Ok, I think you get the gist. You can move. Fine, I'm sorry. But listen to me next time, OK? Viviane, my Viviane... I didn't know if I could call, I got Eliyahu earlier. Yeah, I know. Can I see you? No, I don't think so. Please, Viviane... Let's drop it, Albert. Tell me where. Just for half an hour, we'll have coffee. Viviane? - Yes. What do you say, Viviane? Tomorrow's Friday, it's not a good time. I really don't have the time. Just for coffee, half an hour and I'll say goodbye. OK. I'll try. Tomorrow at 2, say? I'll wait at the bus stop downstairs from your flat. No, not there. At the caf?, then... by the 59 bus stop, remember? Yes, I do. I'm not sure I can make it, though. I'll be waiting. OK. Say, are the rolls gonna give it some volume? I desperately need some volume. I've got 3 and half hairs left on my head, and pumps just don't cut it. Who's that? Who's crying in there? Hang on. Lior? Lior, you're still in there?! I don't believe this, the boy's been locked there all day long! How is this possible?! Eviathar! Gabrielle! Come here! Darling, open the door! Mammy's here to help, darling. Don't be afraid! Where were you! I thought I asked you to check on him?! You never do as you're told! Go get Dona! Go get Dona! Got locked in the bathroom all day long... Lior... I'm such an idiot! Coming... What's wrong? - Lior. Viviane, should I start the hair drier? - Yes, Ela. Wait, darling, hang on. So sorry, Ela, really I am. Gabrielle, go start the hair dryer for Ella. I'll be right with you. It's OK, main thing he's not constipated any more. Darling... Don't you want to make up, darling? Eviathar, baby? My love? - No. Why not? What did I do? Nothing. Why are you home so late? Work, that's why. You think I go there for laughs? Darling... Know what I did today? I went to see Neta at the bank, and she gave us the loan. You know we're going to get a new car in no time? You don't have a license yet. I'm taking lessons, though. Yeah, for a year now. Viviane, any zucchinis left? Dunno, check the stove. That's not true. I've been getting lessons for 8 months, that's all. You know I don't have that much time for lessons, darling. None left. So try the fridge. Darling... Know what else I did today? I ordered the bookbase you wanted. Viviane, there's nothing there! Then boil some eggs or fry an omelet or something! Eggs again? I had eggs for breakfast! I don't know, Eliyahu, darling, what are you, five? The Fridge is full of food, fix yourself something. You happy about the bookbase? Bookcase, mom. - Say again? Bookcase. Well, the guy at the furniture shop, he got me all mixed up. I told him I wanted a book cabinet, he said "bookbase". That's what the man said. So, are you happy? Give us a smile! Give me a kiss, baby... Darling... Who loves you, Who? Who's my handsome boy? What do I do about this one now? Eliyahu! The evening news! You want to come, watch the news? What do I do about him? I'm exhausted. Give me a hug, baby. Kiss me, my baby. All better? Everything OK, baby? Don't be so sad. Right... Why are you sitting in the dark again? Don't you want to eat? Viviane, leave me alone. Everything's OK. I'm tired and I have a headache, that's all. You skipped lunch, now you're skipping dinner? Why, Eliyahu? You think you're punishing me? Suit yourself. Suit yourself, Eliyahu. What is it you want? You want this to have a bad ending? Because it will, I swear to you on our children. It will. So stay here in the dark like a dog, if that's what you want. I'll let you be. - Viviane, cut it out! Why make a mountain out of a molehill? What did I say! I'm tired, is all! I'm at the post office all day long and on my lunch break I get the groceries and I cook! I haven't had a bite to eat since this morning! I'm not asking for much, Viviane! - Then put something on the stove. Put it on the stove. You've got a pair of hands, thank God! We've got peas, put the pot on the stove. You think I had me a beach party today? From the moment I opened my eyes this morning it was... All day long! Rivka, Gerti, Ela, Neta, Gerti, and it's not done yet! What else do you want from me, Eliyahu? And this? And this? What, that's not food? Isn't it? You tell me. Shall I put it on the stove for you? Day old peas? No thanks, Viviane, I'm not hungry. What's the big deal? So it's a day old! What, it's no good? Eliyahu, when you're hungry, you eat what you get. Fridge's jam packed, fix yourself something to eat, but don't say there's no food here! Viviane, do you understand what I'm telling you? I'm telling you I don't want anything. Enough! Right. Suit yourself. Fine. I can't get a word in with you, always shouting. I so much as open my mouth and you're busting my chops! Eliyahu, when I get hungry I take a slice of bread, put some spread on it and never open my mouth. I don't say anything, and I don't act like a spoilt kid. You should be thanking me for doing all I do around here. Take Sandrine. She doesn't work. Her husband works dawn to dusk, comes home at 9 PM, and she's waiting there for him to take her to a restaurant. What do you reckon her daily routine is? Idling. Friends, beauty shop, caf?s... And me, what have I got? I don't even know what the inside of a caf? looks like. Have I ever told you not to go? Go to as many caf?s as you like! Who with, Eliyahu? By myself? It can't go on like this, Eliyahu. I will not spend my entire life with you like this. The kids will move out, I'll pack my bags, and disappear on you. I won't stay here, Eliyahu. Wait and see. You threatening me? You're just threatening yourself. Why do you think Denise left your brother? You leave my family out of it. - Why should I? Go fish! - Viviane, keep your voice down. What do I care? I don't care, Eliyahu! Go, go close all the windows. I don't care if the whole world hears us! I'm sick of it! I'm sick of keeping quiet! You're sick of it?! I'm the one who's always keeping quiet! Eliyahu, shut up. Shut up, I tell you! You're telling me to shut up in my own home? Who d'ya think you are? Yeah, I'm telling you. Shut up! One more word out of you and I'll freak out, and ruin the Shabbat. You think you're threatening me? That's between you and Him! What would you do? What would I do? That's what I'd do! That's what I'd do! Right there! I dare you to say another word! I'd like to see you say something! Let's see if you've got the guts to say another word! Get him out of here! Get him out! I don't want to see his face! Mom, calm down... - Get him out of here! Calm down... Where are my brothers now, so they could see what I have to deal with! Where's my father, so he could see how his daughter has to live! He came and begged them to get me back just a few days ago! It was barely a day ago you idiot! Viviane. What's the matter, why are you hollering? Let me be! - What's with you? Sit down, this is crazy! What's the matter? I don't know, Dona. I really don't. I barely said a word, and she smashed the plate. Shut up already! I can't stand hearing your voice! "Barely said a word..." He's spewing poison out of his mouth! Snake! Look at your brother, a rabbi! And he let his wife go! She told him that she didn't want him, and he told her: "Go!" What does he want from me... Let me go! I want him to let me go, to set me free! What does he want from me? What does he want from me? Does he want me to die? He won't let go until I'm dead and buried! Stop that! Don't be doing that! Don't do this to us... God have mercy, Lord, protect us! Eliyahu, please take the children to the kitchen. Enough already! Is this what you want? Look! He won't leave me alone till I'm dead and buried! Let her! - Stop! Let her, let her do her "number". She wants the children to see her like that. Enough with that, go stay in the kitchen! Shut up! Shut up! He wants to kill me! He wants to kill me! - What did you do to her, Eliyahu? Enough! What are you, crazy? Have some dignity! Have you lost your mind? No one sees what he's doing to me, Nobody! They all think he's innocent and pure as the driven snow! Enough already. Look at yourself now, my beautiful Viviane! What did you do to her? Go to the kitchen, take the kids! I'm better off as a widow! Are you listening to what you're saying, Viviane? Is this what we've come to? She's the end of me, that woman. The end of my life. I don't give a damn about you and about your religion! Who d'ya think you are? Who? You haven't got an ounce of humility in you! You put on that yarmulke, and go around telling lies! Liar, a liar is what you are! That's what you're worth! What are you doing?! That's far enough! I can't take it anymore, I can't! Go to the kitchen, go! - How much longer, Eliyahu? I can't take it anymore! Bells and whistles... Go to the kitchen! God, You are watching me, You are my witness. The Great Tribunal will give its verdict on us both. Want me to leave? - Shut up already... - I'm leaving. What have I got to lose? Nothing. Do us all a favor, go to the kitchen. Go. You saw that? You all did. She hit me. She raised her hand on me. Is that what you want, you want him to go? You want to end up with nothing?! That's what you want? You can't treat a man like that. Take my Shimon: Won't even put the glass in the sink! He could never so much as boil an egg, but Eliyahu... Use your head! A smart woman knows when to speak and when to keep quiet, when to open her eyes and when to close them! You respect him, and do as you please. What do you want? I never saw anything like this, ever! Look at Rachelle. Her husband gave her as many jewels as she could wear, she was all silver and gold! Her hands were loaded with gold and diamonds. Like this! And she told him: "Take it all!" "There!" "Don't need anything of yours". She left him, and she left everything with him. How about you, Eliyahu? What have you ever given me? What have you given me? Ten years I've been begging you to get your drivers license. Ten years! I have poor eyesight, but he doesn't! He's ignoring me and my needs. Ten years! Till when? Till when, Eliyahu? Till when? When will you ever do anything for me? When have you given me so much as a flower or a kiss? When? When have you ever come up to me and told me: "Viviane... "I have a surprise for you. "Come on, let's eat out, let's catch a film". When, Eliyahu? When? When have you ever come to hold me after seeing me crying? When, Eliyahu? When have you ever thanked me, and said: "Thanks for all you do for me. "For me and for our children". When, Eliyahu? When, Eliyahu? In bed... I don't remember anymore. I don't remember, Eliyahu. I just don't. He's incapable of pity, that man. Dona, he's incapable of pity. Would you rather have a husband like Victor, who blows his entire paycheck on a single game of cards? What a shame I don't drink or hit you. Maybe then she could appreciate what she has. You tell her that, Dona. I'd rather... I'd rather you hit me, Eliyahu. I'd rather you hit me, hit me... and then hold me, rather than leave me like this. Come on, son, come, Eliyahu, go to sleep. No, mother. No. You go to sleep. How would I sleep? How? How would I sleep when I'm so worried about you. Don't worry. Everybody fights and then makes up. Don't you cry, my baby. Don't worry. Enough. Go to sleep, cherie. It's late already. Everything's going to be alright. See that, my little girl? You take this lucky charm and put it in your wallet. Till your wedding day, even. Hold on to it. But I don't have a wallet. I'll give you one. Put it in your bag. Don't ever part with it. It'll keep you wherever you go. - OK, granny. Maybe you should get a divorce, dad. You're on her side, too? ... And say Amen. - Amen. Go with your uncle Simo. You coming? - Be right there, go on. Zuhara, Mother couldn't make it. She's not feeling very well. She cries a lot over you. But it's OK, she's holding up. It'll all work out, thank the Lord. Zuhara, for all the good deeds you and father have done... Help us. I'm in total desperation. I don't know what to do anymore. Viviane... Watch over her. Watch over the children. Help us find the righteous path. The right path, Zuhara. How long has it been, Viviane? Two, three years? I heard you had another child. You haven't changed, beautiful as ever. And the others, how are they? - Fine, thank God. They're fine. Eviathar has changed a lot since he had his Bar Mitzvah. He's a real man now. Gabrielle has also grown. You wouldn't recognize her. I will always recognize her. And Lior? Driving me up the walls. Look, I've got pictures. Time sure does fly, huh? Black coffee, Viviane? - Yes. Would you like anything to eat? - No, I'm good. Maybe a cake, though. Chocolate or cheese cake, whatever you've got. We'll take both, and caf?-au-lait for me. Thanks. I stopped on the way to buy you a Tunisian spicy sandwich, with lemon, Just how you like it. It's in the car. How about you? How is it going? Me? Same old, Viviane. At least it's more simple for me in Africa. I'm there for work. I try to stay late in the office, go home, watch TV, turn in and that's that. And Lili? Is she OK? Lili? - Yeah. - I really can't tell you much. I try to see as little as possible of her. Just for the kids. Thank you. Thanks. And Eliyahu, how is he doing? He's doing exactly as he always does. We had another meltdown last night. How much longer, Viviane? - How much longer... You know all you have to do is say the word. Let's not get into all that again, OK? Just say the word, and I'll leave everything. I wasn't ready three years ago. I know I let you down. It caught me off guard, Viviane. I knew if you'd leave Eliyahu, I'd give everything up for you. That it would be the easiest, most natural thing to do for me. But when the moment of truth came, I... I know I let you down. So I took my family and left the country. But everything's different now. I will leave Lilliane any way. Give me another chance. Forget it. I would never leave my children. With the children, Viviane. I love them like they were my own. I won't leave Eliyahu. - Why not? Tell me why not. I've waited 12 years for you, Viviane. I'll wait 10 or 20 more, until you could be with me. I don't believe that. - I do. Even when I'm 70, it would still be worth it. Did you buy a car? No, but I'm taking driving lessons now. After I pass the license exam I'll buy a small car. My cousin's got a Volkswagen Beetle. I know he wants to sell it. '64. You interested? Yeah... A Beetle, is that a good one? - Great car. It was made for you. How much is it? I think he wants 1,600 for it. That's a bit too pricey. I've got dollars here. I'll pay you back. I love you so much, Viviane. If you only knew how much. I have to go. It'll be Shabbat soon. When will I see you? I don't know. I should get going. Thanks. You go talk to him. He won't get up. Leave him alone, Eliyahu. Leave the boy alone. He's almost a man now! He's putting me to shame! What would they say at synagogue? He'll go there later. Open up, I just need my shirt. Open up. Mom, he's leaving his stuff in my room again! Tell him! No problem, Eviathar. You'll pay for all the things you do to your father. You'll find a woman one day who'll squeeze you like a lemon. Mom! - Shhht! Why did you leave your shirt in his room again, huh? I ironed it for Shabbat, and put it there so it wouldn't crease! He's doing it on purpose, just so he could wake me up! Baby, never mind, just give him his shirt. You've had your Bar Mitzvah already, finished! Up till now, I was culpable for your sins. But now they're on you! It's your responsibility. I don't want to go to synagogue, is that too complicated for you? Get lost! I don't want to go! - I'm begging you, leave him alone. Leave him alone, please! Everybody goes to synagogue with their sons! I have to go alone?! Aaron's son is only 7, and he can read the Book! He goes to synagogue every Shabbat! Am I asking too much here? You can't force him to come with you. I'm their father! I get no respect in this house! They do as they damn well please, these kids! It's too late now, Eliyahu. Where have you been up till now? Where? You think you can drop out of the sky and boss them around? No! It's because they look at you. They follow your example! That's your education? There's the result, right there! Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this? Why? What is it you want? To ruin my day for me? This Shabbat, too? You want to ruin it for me? You want to ruin my Shabbat for me? You want to ruin my Shabbat for me? Go ahead! Go ahead, ruin it for me. Go right ahead. Viviane, what are you doing? Viviane! Viviane! There. There. What are you doing? - Go ahead, ruin it for me. I asked you to leave me in peace this Shabbat! This Shabbat. Eliyahu, I'm begging you, I'm begging you, Listen to me. Do something. Do something! I don't have the strength for this. I don't. I will go after my lovers, who give me food and water, wool and linen, oil and drink. Therefore I shall put hurdles in her path: Thorns and spines, ; I shall wall her in so that she cannot find her way. She will chase after her lovers but catch them she won't, ; she will look for them but find them she won't. Then she will say, "I will go back "to my husband as at first, "for then I was better off than now..." Don't cry, little girl... Little girl of mine...
