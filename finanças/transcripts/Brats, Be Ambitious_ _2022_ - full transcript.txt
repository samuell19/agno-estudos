- Bye bye. - Bye bye. See you tomorrow. -Hello. We agreed that if your grades don't improve, we have to attend extra classes! You did worse on this exam than last semester! Japanese, math, and science, all got C grades. What are you doing? How could this happen? Alright, fine. I'll be more serious in sixth grade. You say that every time. Look! Even though Mom is like this, she's still working hard! Okay, please tuck in your shirt properly... Anyway, after spring break, you're going for extra classes. I've enrolled you already. Wait, you can't do this. I can. You promised, if we get all C grades, we have to go! Why are you staring, idiot! You're back. Watch your language! Your report card? wow great! You've been working hard. Practice the piano before lunch. I want to go play with Yuri. Look at Ako's report card. - All A's. - Alright, alright. Anyway, you have to attend extra classes. You promised me. I didn't promise. - You did! - No! -You did! - Want some dessert? You have to go! There's chocolate over there. I didn't agree. Yes, you did. I really didn't. Yes, you did. You have to go! Stop shouting. The neighbors will hear. He himself said that sixth Graders have to attend cram school. I didn't. I only said I might go... There's no "might" about it! Keep your voice down. Is lunch ready? Lunch, lunch, all you think about is food. Look for yourself. Shun, your grades are really bad. I don't want to go to extra classes. I'll study hard. There's no other way, you have to go. Starting to work hard in sixth grade is too late. Ako, stop playing the piano. You should eat too. Anyway, you have to attend the extra classes. I won't go! You have to go! Keep your voice down. I'll be right there. You're spoiling him too much. He won't make it if he doesn't go now. I talked to him already. Bring me some tea. What tea? That child doesn't listen at all. Why are you crying? I'm not crying. Let's go. Tokage. Tokage! Tokage! Tokage, Tokage. Tokage. Tokage, wake up. Ouch, it hurts! I brought your report card. You did better than Ryuzo. Did you cheat? Take off your shoes. My mom will get mad. Idiot, my feet will get dirty. She's still as strict as ever. Don't touch her chest. You... you'll get cursed. Nonsense, there's no curse. I'm so hungry. I want to eat something at your house. Ew, gross. Are all these foods spoiled? - There's some that's not spoiled yet. - Tokage, I'll take the sausage. Here you go. Tokage, wake up. Let's go. Faster. I... I still want to sleep. Wait... wait a minute. Hey, wait for me! Wait...wait for me! - Faster. - Faster. Are you sitting properly? Ah, my... my shoes. Slowly. What are you doing? Let's go. Are you ready? Tokage, where did your mom go? I... I don't know. She was just glaring at us. And this fish sausage is so bad. Yeah. Shotaro. Shotaro. Stop playing video games and come out with us. Wait a moment. Wow, it's a PC Engine game console. When did you get it? Yesterday. - I... I want to play too. Let me play. Don't be noisy. I'll go get some drinks. - Don't stare at her. - Are you in love with her? Want a cigarette? - Give it a try. It's great. - No... no, thanks. You smoke! Stop looking. - Here, have a drink. - Thank you! Cigarettes... here's your cigarette. Who's that guy? - He threw the cigarette back at you. - Let it go. - Cheers! - Cheers! Your sister is quite scary. Let's go. Hey! Wait up! - 100 yen. - 100 yen? But you need a 10 yen coin for the candy store. - Take a 500 yen one. - I only see 100 yen. The economy isn't doing well, huh? Can't see us, huh? Hey, old man! Let's go buy some snacks. Alright, let's go. Too bad. We'll come back next time. Aunt. This won't win anything, right? We can sue you for fraud! Nonsense! If you want, ask your dad or mom for money. I don't have a dad. I don't have a mom. Then ask your murderer dad for some. Ryuzo's dad killed seven people! With... a legendary samurai sword! He can kill you! Come on, if he hits me, I'll hit back! Your mom's messed up too. She wanted me to join that weird religion! That... that's Buddhism, idiot! Hey, let's go. I know your mom too. When she moved here, she always dressed so flashy, like a can-can dancer. What's a "Cancan dancer"? Tell your parents, they're all sick! I told you! What you said just now is defamation, got it? We can sue you for fraud too! Then go ahead and sue! No stealing allowed! Hey, steal quickly! I am Kawada. It's you again! This isn't a restaurant, understand? Don't call here again, idiot! I told you, I'm Kawada! What's the number you dialed? Say it now! No, it's wrong! My number is 4, not 3... let's go! It hurts, it hurts! Tokage, take it! Ouch, ouch, ouch. Is it dead? Mike! Miike... Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch. You're still alive? Thank goodness! You bastards, go to hell! - Did you see anything? - No. Yes, there must be something here. Will the candy store lady report us? Who cares about her. Someone seems really gloomy today. Who? you. What about cram school? I have to start in April. Is it for the entrance exam to the private middle school? Didn't your mom mention that you have to attend extra classes? Well, that's true, but... I don't want to go to extra classes. Then just skip it. We caught something! - It's heavy. - We caught something. Pull, pull it up! I see it! I see it! No, it's too heavy. Yes, Tokage, catch it! Go catch it, hurry! It's slimy and slippery. So stinky, so stinky, so stinky. - So gross. - What is it? - It's not moving anymore. - This is disgusting. Is it still alive? What are you guys doing? We're telling the teacher. Hey, what are you guys doing? Run, run, run! Tokage, hurry! We're in trouble! Tokage! Tokage, get in the car! Get in quickly! The teacher's behind us! Quick! Let's go! Wait! Come back! Let's go to the Hell Tunnel! - Alright, let's go! 【Brats Brats, Be Ambitious!】 I... if we run... run to the other side of the tunnel, Will... will our wishes come true? Who knows? I heard that before Jackie Chan became famous, He did this here. It's just a rumor. - Poke your butt! - Get lost! Tokage, what's your wish? Can you speak without stuttering? I... I won't have itchy skin anymore. Go ahead then. W... what if there's a big bear inside? I heard it'll eat the cracked-mouth girl. Idiot, those are just legends. If there's really a bear, we'll use Ryuzo's dad's samurai sword to deal with it. What... what wish are you making? Get in already! - The bear's coming. - Wait... wait a moment. Run! Tokage is going to be eaten! - Hurry, run! - Don't... don't leave me... No need to worry. What? Cram school? Well, you won't be able to get into a private school anyway. Whether you attend extra classes or not, you won't be smarter than Shotaro. So, in the end, we'll all go to the same junior high school. True. Aren't you taking the entrance exam? I come from a single-parent family, so I'll still go to a public school. But my goal is to go to Tokyo University. What's "Tokyo University"? Ryuzo Takashi, you'll never get there. Shut up, idiot. If you accidentally get into a private school, I will study hard and transfer to your school. April we will be in sixth grade. It's unbelievable. Tokage, get on the bike! Sixth grade, time for school. I... I will. Quickly check your class and go into the classroom. We've been separated. But you're lucky, you're in Miss. Shoko's class. Good, she's not my type. Tokage, come here! I... I also want to be in Miss. Shoko's class. Don't act strange or touch your face anymore. And if Akira bullies you, ask Shun for help. Will you help? let's go. Wishing everyone a successful new semester. - What's this? - Huh? - Let me see. - What? A movie magazine. Is Jackie Chan in there? Yes! Let me find it... Tokage! In the same class again. This year will be fun too. Haha, you're really lucky. It suits you well. Don't take it off. Shun, in the same class again. Uh... yeah. He said "uh... yeah." Don't stutter like Tokage. If Ryuzo not here, so you'll have to rely on Tokage. Alright, everyone back to your seats. Make sure to clean the blackboard. Good morning. I am Takayuki Uchida. Starting today, I'll be your homeroom teacher. Let's work together this year. The lines are the same as last year. Come on, who's more excited about being taught by Miss Shoko? Put your hands down! Even though sixth grade has just begun, I have some sad news to share today. Is that okay? During spring break, a few troublemakers hurt our salamander. Does anyone know who it was? no one knows? Takasaki, Tokaji, report to the principal's office. Now let's take attendance. Aoki. Aoki? Iida. Yamagishi, both of you were seen catching the salamander. Now that you're in sixth grade, you need to mature a bit. Did you also steal Mrs. Kawada's cat? I don't know. She said you guys were at her store. How could she be so sure? She mentioned something about a yakuza's son... Just by hearing some rumors, we know it's definitely you! That cat got hit by a truck. Mr. Uchida, I dislike it when people shout. It's good that you're interested in salamanders. I understand why you wanted to catch it. But what you did is animal cruelty. Luckily, the cat survived. But your actions are inexcusable. Can I say something? The shop owner treated me and my friends with discrimination, Just like what Mr. Uchida said earlier. Ryuzo is called the "son of a gangster," She even denied his mother's religious beliefs, Said I don't have a dad, Can this kind of discrimination be forgiven? - Don't talk back! - I'm not talking back, I'm stating facts. Do you want a beating? Oppose violence! Clean the sludge from the swimming pool, that's your punishment. Be careful not to harm insects in winter, like dragonflies. Make sure it's cleaned thoroughly. Takasaki? Nishino, what are you doing here? I'm here for Cram school. Really? I've been doing it since third grade. What about you, Takasaki? I... starting today. Today, huh? Then you can sit here. Front row, the hellish seats. You're starting your extra study today, right? What should we fill in below, Takagi? - One sixth. -Right, one sixth. Pretty simple, isn't it? Next, multiply the reciprocal of the numerator and denominator. How do we multiply that? Let me see... Takasaki, is that correct? Yes. How should we multiply it? I don't know. You don't know? I don't know. Well... what about the student next to you, Ikariya? - Multiply by six. - Exactly, multiply by six. You all got it. And then... I can't keep up at all. What? cram school. It's alright, just say you can't if you can't. I'm having trouble too. I only go to cram school because of my parents. At least it's better than school. School is much better than this. But I'm happy to study with you. It's boring alone. Are you alright? Shun! Over here! Welcome back. - How's the cram school? - It's okay. Ah, your friend? I'm Nishino, from the same school as him. Really? Please take care of him again. This kid really doesn't want to go to cram school, quite a headache. Alright, that's enough. Goodbye. Goodbye. Shun, how was your day? Just average. What do you mean by "just average"? Hey, wait for me! Shun! What are you doing? Slow down on the bike! Shun! Wait for me! Eat up. Why aren't you eating? Shun, want to come with me? To the equipment room in the gym. Idiot, I'm just messing with you. The equipment room is our territory now, don't use it. No entry. Tell Ryuzo for me. Let's go. Move! Let's go. - Where are we going? -To the equipment room in the gym. Again, again, again. Give him a flying body press! Nicely done, nicely done. Too weak, can't beat Joe Higuchi. I want some too. Give me the whole bag. You guys should have some too. let's go. Why do you keep touching your face? I told you not to do that anymore. - I'm not. - You're doing it again, dummy. Are you going to cram school today? Not today. Then after school, let's go find Shotaro. He's probably skipping class to play his new game at home. let's go. -Shotaro. -Shotaro. Shotaro. Hey, Shotaro. I knew you'd be playing video games. Don't skip class again, or you'll get called to the principal's office. - Really? -I... I want to play too. - i... i want to. -You're so noisy. My sister caught a cold, be quiet, or she'll beat us up. Your sister has a cold? Tokage, go and smell her. - Smell her, quickly. -Huh? Tokage, smell her. Smell her. Smell. one more time. Quickly. She smells so good... - What the hell is going on here!? - Run! Hurry! - You jerk! Go die! - Don't fight! What did you do to me? Tell me! unforgivable. Stop fighting! What's wrong? It's nothing. You should have a drink too. I heard a middle schooler committed suicide in the Hell Tunnel. Yeah, they might turn into a ghost. Do you want to... go see a ghost? Are you scared? I'm not scared. What's that? Looks like an air gun. - Here it is. - So slow. -You guys ran too fast. -Run faster. faster. You guys... you're not allowed to step into my house again! My sister beat me up! How does she smell? It's... it's nice. You big dummy! I'll get beaten up because of you. She said she's gonna kill you guys. Alright, get up! Let's go together to take care of her. Wait, wait. It's so cold, so cold. Shotaro. Wait a moment, it's really itchy. Shun, come down for a moment. Have you been there? - Yeah, many times. - Which places? - Matsumoto city, and so on. - The city area. Shun, come say hello. This is Kobayashi, he just moved nearby. Take good care of him. This kid is very popular. They should become good friends. Nice to meet you. Come in and have a seat. Sorry for disturbing you so late. Take off your sunglasses; it's nighttime now. I'm coming in. - Please, come in. - Which room? Which one? This one. Where should I sit? Sit over there. Is there an ashtray? Huh? An ashtray. Um... we don't have one. Never mind, I'm quitting smoking, but it's really hard. So, where did you move from? Europe, I've changed schools seven times. Who's the toughest person in your school? Huh? Why? Wherever I go, I find the toughest person and beat them until they're defeated. Who is it? Who knows, there are many tough students at our school. Then, I'll find out myself. You obviously aren't one of them. Why? He asked me who's the toughest, annoying. Beat him up? Ignore him, it's better. Tell Tokate go help you beat him up. He didn't come today. What, he doesn't want to come to school again? Anyway, that Kobayashi really looks down on people. He definitely didn't come from Europe. If he wants to fight, tell him to look for Akira, don't bother with him. Seiya Shida. Volume and surface area are completely different. Go back to fifth grade. Tokaji Genta didn't come today. Shun Takasaki. have You're very diligent. You've made rapid progress in sixth grade. Are you cheating? No, I'm not. Just kidding! Don't get angry. Yuki Nomura. You've regressed quite a bit. It's amazing. I couldn't do two of the questions. Really? I thought you'd get a perfect score. Then why did we send you to cram school? Ako, give Dad a seat. Don't watch TV too much, praise him more. We should frame that test paper. No, don't do that. I'll keep improving, can I please not go to cram school? You've only done well once, work harder and you can do better. Are you saying if my grades get better, I don't have to go to cram school? Hey, Dad. Get 100 on another test, then we'll talk. No competitions today? I'll go take a shower then. Huh? Let's eat first. How about you take me to the movies? "Flying Dragon Warriors" is still showing. I see. We need to go before it's off the screens. Didn't you say you wanted to watch it? Let's eat first. Take Ryuzo with you. If you get a perfect score, he'll definitely take you. How about Saturday? don't show your ass here. What did you say? then it's settled. Hey, where's Ryuzo? Art class. With Kobayashi. Kobayashi? Oh, Shun! Try this! This gun feels real. Give it a shot, hurry. this is my gun. What's the big deal? No. What's wrong? We're going to the movies on Saturday. It's Jackie Chan's new film. Saturday, huh... What's up? Do you have plans? We have a shooting competition. You don't have to go to cram school on Saturday? not this week. I really want to go, but I already promised them. Kobayashi isn't as bad as we thought. Want to go to the haunted tunnel? We'll find time for that later. What about the Tokage? He didn't come today. Uh-oh, Teacher is here! Quick, hide the gun! Hey, what's going on here? What are you hiding behind your back? Show it to me. Give it to me. Kobayashi, pass it to you. Ryuzo, hurry, let's go. What exactly are you guys hiding? Show it to me! Takasaki. Nishino, what are you doing here? I'm here to watch "Flying Dragon Warriors." Takasaki, you too? I'm also here to watch "Flying Dragon Warriors." It's really good, isn't it? -What are you watching? -This. I really want to buy one. You're quite brave, going to the movies by yourself. Hurry up and eat! You really like movies, don't you? Yes, I love them. What kind of movies do you watch? I watch all kinds, but I particularly love comedies. They only watch action movies. Are there other types, like "Apocalypse Now" or something? I also really like "Apocalypse Now." Shun, come to my place sometime. I have many movies you can borrow. You're a good person. Maybe you can teach him to study too. Sure, actually Shun is very talented. He got a perfect score last time. Yeah, learning is so much fun, isn't it? Not at all, it's even less fun than before. Why are you so shy? I'm not shy. I feel like having shark fin soup. Mom wants to drink too - Dad. - No. dad. no. Why? They don't have it here. Order something else. This is disappointing, shark fin... Sir, five bowls of shark fin soup, right? - that's awesome. - very strong. This gun can do continuous shooting. - Incredible! - This gun costs 100,000 yen. - 100,000! That's outrageous. - true. You'll have to pay if you break it. I won't! You really love movies, huh? Takasaki. Just call me Shun. You called me that the other day. When was that? Huh? What? To your house. You said I could borrow movies, how about Sunday? Sure! I'll pick some for you. - Are there any Jackie Chan movies? - Nishino. Let's make it Sunday then. Thank you! Wait a moment. - Wait a moment. - What? Let's take a look at your bag. You have to study hard, alright? I know. What do you know? Alright, go. If you don't understand anything, ask Nishino. Hey. Hey. Ryuzo! Long time no see. Hello. what happened to your face? Did your dad hit you? No... my mom did this to me. Is your mom back? - Yes. - Is she doing okay? - Will she stay? - Mom, it's fine now. - Are you riding your bicycle? - My dad took it. let's go. -What about you? - I'm not riding. Ryuzo, you have to study hard, okay? Goodbye! Are you going to cram school today? no but... Aren't you with Kobayashi and the others? Kobayashi went to see his cousin, and Sotaro isn't around either. Tokage went out to preach with his mom. where are you going? I'm going to Nishino's house. Nishino? We're in the same cram school, both in Class 2. Are you going to study? You should come along. Can I? Sure, he's a pretty nice guy. Hey Nishino! Hey. This is Ryuzo from Class 1, can he come too? Yeah, sure. Sorry, this is a bit sudden. No problem. your house is so big. Please come in. Amazing... This garden is huge. How many rooms do you have? I haven't counted, maybe around 20. 20! My family only has two rooms. What does your dad do? Nothing particularly special. He's not in the Yakuza, is he? Actually, I don't know either. Wow... that's cool. Pretty extreme... How many films do you have? Probably around a thousand. - A thousand? - A thousand... - Have you seen them all? - Yeah, pretty much. Steven Spielberg said if you want to be a director, you have to watch a lot of movies. Huh? You want to be a director!? Not sure if it'll work out. Really? You're really talented! I had no idea! I'll tell you, hey, do you have any adult movies? in my dad's room. But they're uncensored and the quality is bad. Really? You've watched uncensored adult movies! Can we watch them? - the cabinet is locked. - no way. But I have "Emmanuelle" and "White Snake Chronicle." My dad has watched "Emmanuelle." Let's watch that then. Watch it. Alright, forget about this. Did you make this one? "Wild Ninja Little Wisdom." Directed by Satoshi Nishino, right? Ah, yes. - Watch this. - No, don't. Watch "Emmanuelle." Stop being so annoying, watch this! This is not good at all. - It's okay, take a look. - It's really bad. Do you guys want to try making a film? A film? Use this video camera to shoot. - What's this? - Let's go outside. - Wait. - Hey. Gaze at each other, continue the eye contact. touch the ground. Ready... Go! Very good, very good. Shun, put more effort into it. Good... Push again, don't stop. Shun, get your face closer. Closer, even closer. Alright, kiss him now. Kiss him, kiss him. Alright, cut! You kissed! You really did! He suddenly kissed me. No, it's not true! It was Yamanashi who told me to kiss. He's the director. Did I say it that way? Shun and Ryuzo kissed! Director, let's make a movie! Huh? We have airsoft guns, we can make a war film! Huh, use my gun? What's the big deal? Don't be so stingy. If you break it, you will pay me 100,000 won. It's not worth that much. Director, let's make a movie! Well, we still need to write a script. What's a script? Something like a screenplay, with lines written on it. Like a blueprint for a movie. we need a screenwriter. Who else can we find? You're the only option. me? There's no one else but you. Alright, I got it! - Include the Tokage too. - No, no, no! I'll include everyone. Then it's settled. What about the other girls? Dummy, the girls are so ugly. What do you mean? I'm saying you all are ugly. You boys are the ugly ones! You're the ugly freaks! You're the ugly freaks! Go say that to a mirror. Ugly guy! I'm going to tell the teacher! What kind of script do you want to write? I'm not sure yet. Everyone's looking forward to it. Can I really do it? Of course, you're the next Steven Spielberg. Actually, compared to Spielberg, I prefer Francis Coppola. You always eat chocolate croissants. My parents come home very late, so this is my dinner. I love it. Shun, you really like Ryuzo, right? It's not what you think. I've seen friendship like this in many movies. When did you two become such good friends? I don't remember, actually. What happened? Having a best friend feels great. It's not like we're best friends or anything. Are you okay? It tastes really bad. Ryuzo.. Can you still have dinner? Yes, I can. That's good. Mom, aren't you eating this? I'll get fat. But you love to eat it. D... Director, it's... it's him... What's wrong? Come quickly! You've been getting along well with Ryuzo lately. Are you feeling proud? Alright, hand it over. We'll... We'll go get Ryuzo! - Wait - But... but Director... Shun... Hey, he... he took your money. Don't tell anyone. Tell... tell Ryuzo. He'll help. it's useless. Why? Don't you trust Ryuzo? Why can't Ryuzo help you? Masao told Akira to do this. Masao? Masao is supporting Akira from behind. Even after graduating from junior high, he still wants to follow him, so he often gives him money. He's been asking me for money for a long time... Ma... Masha... Masha... When the entrance exam is over, I'll be free after graduating. Time to clean up. When Masao was in fourth grade, he got into a fight with a gang. In the end, he won. Ryuzo wouldn't stand a chance against Masao. What should we do? He told us not to tell anyone. Anyway... let's wait and see. What's going on? What's going on? Huh? Say what you want to say. "The spring has passed unnoticed, the fragrant breeze gently strolls" "Embracing the greenery on the hill" "Last year's white clothes, piece by piece, and this year, whose clothes are hanging out to dry?" Okay, what's the meaning behind "白衣的枕词"? This gun is new, probably costs around 300,000. Its accuracy is even higher than a real gun. Give it a shot. Ryuzo, you try it. Ryuzo... The director hasn't been coming recently. Ah, he's probably resting at home with a cold. Is he working on the script? I'll ask and see. I have to go for tutoring today. Tell him to start filming soon. Did he run away because he couldn't come up with a script? shut up. How did Ryuzo do on the test this time? I don't know. - What about Shotaro? - Probably 100 points. I don't know. What about Tokage? I don't know. Hi, Takasaki! Good morning! Good morning! Good morning! What's up? Sh... Should we go to the director's house today? He hasn't been to school in ten days. He's definitely not just sick. He... Probably ran into some trouble. But he told us not to tell anyone. What can we do? You're right. But... The director... he's our friend. Tokaji sit down. Uh, before I call roll... There's something I want to tell everyone. Recently, Nishino has been taking leave. I'm sure you've noticed. Due to family reasons, Nishino will be transferring to another school. It's sudden, so he couldn't say goodbye to everyone. We'll write him a letter in a little while. Even though it's sad, we hope Nishino will get better and better. Let's wish him the best, alright? Alright. good Let's start the roll call. Aoki. Enomoto. Kamiya. Um... that one. What's wrong, Tokaji? N... Nishino, he... Yeah, what about him? He... doesn't want to transfer. Everyone, Tokaji is right. He empathizes with Nishino's situation, right? His money was taken away. Tokaji come with me. Everyone, please study on your own for now. Where is the director moving to? I haven't heard that yet. We had just become good friends, it's such a shame. I... I just spoke the truth. Hey! It's all his fault. Enough already! He's the one who abandoned Nishino. Saw him being bullied but didn't help. Such a great friend. Ryuzo noticed something was off with Nishino. Tokage told us everything, But Ryuzo said you would handle it and told us not to interfere. But in the end, you did nothing. You acted like it wasn't your business. Hey, say something! Alright, that's enough. Masha is the one pulling the strings behind the scenes. So, don't blame him. Don't worry about it. You all think I'm an idiot. All of you, think I'm an idiot. That's not true. Hey! He doesn't have a fever, but he says he's feeling really unwell. Can we let him go home to rest? He was fine just a moment ago. Kids getting sick suddenly is common. is that so? Would you... like to go fishing together? You're Ryuzo's friend, right? Yes. What's your name? Shun Takasaki. I remember. Your mom came to scold me once. Thank her for me, okay? She made lunch for Ryuzo. Am I really scary? N... no. You're really scary. It's raining. Here, let's shake hands. You can keep the fishing rod. I'll give you some alcohol, don't talk about it. 38.8 degrees. Who told you to go home in the rain? Try to eat something, even jelly is fine. Okay. You've been sweating a lot. It's so hot. - mom. - what's wrong? - I can't sleep. - Where's Dad? He's already asleep. Alright, I got it. Make sure to drink plenty of water. Brother has a fever, feels very uncomfortable, you know? - Mom. - Alright, alright. "Don't tell anyone." "But in the end, you did nothing." "You acted like it wasn't your business." "Hey, say something!" "Alright, that's enough." "You can't blame him." "He...he is our friend" It's been less than a year. They say the next five years are the danger period. You never take me seriously! The day I got discharged, I was going to cook dinner... Continue being a housewife. Before I was hospitalized, you never took care of me. All you would say was, "Go to sleep." This isn't just a cold! Mom, are you going to die? Mom, maybe you'll go to heaven. Don't tell children things like that. But it's true isn't it? What's wrong? Are you feeling better? Much better, what's going on? Mom... the cancer has came back. They cut off your breast, right? Yeah, but it didn't work. The cancer cells spread to other parts. Mom will be okay, go upstairs. Dad, talk to her again. What does it matter? They have the right to know. No one knows what will happen next. Mom needs to calm down. I am calm! The doctor said surgery would fix everything. Don't let the kid worry. It's okay, it's okay. You always simplify things. It's not just my illness. You don't care about the family, you only focus on work. Since I married here, how much have I sacrificed? You go upstairs first! You don't understand anything! That's why you can talk so lightly. Stop crying, shut up. Shut up, shut up. Be quiet, be quiet. Quiet, don't argue, don't argue. Hey, what are you doing, stop! No matter what, Mom will eventually die. Then just die already. Hurry up and die! coward! Don't vent your anger on your sister! You're a coward too, that's why you got sick. It's all because you're too weak. Ryuzo. Practice the piano and study hard. mom will be back soon. okay? If you make that expression again, I'll show my breast. Hey, don't be like this, be more proper. I won't really do it, just joking. If you need anything, press the call button on the back. Mom, you won't go to heaven, will you? Absolutely not, don't worry. Ah, if Ako keeps crying... I might go, you know. - She won't go - It's not impossible. right? Well, I think we should be going. Give them more vegetables. - Ok. - See you later. Can you stop crying, okay? Ako. Goodbye. Goodbye. Shun, you need to study hard! Don't worry too much about Mom. But Mom said a lot of worrying things. she must be very anxious. If it were Dad with cancer, he would be even more clueless. Mom is braver than I am. But if you were sick, would you blame Mom like this? I wouldn't, but I understand why she blames me. Dad is too busy with work, neglecting Mom. she must be very lonely. Hurry and eat, the noodles will get soggy. Dad! There's a snake, a snake! Wow! A snake! I'll go find Ryuzo. Hey, it's already late. Ako, come back, you come back! What the hell are you saying! What did you say!? Stop hitting! Don't hit anymore. What kind of joke is this, you bitch. Stop it, stop it. Scumbag! You're asking for a beating, huh? - Stop it - Stop! You abandoned Ryuzo, you bastard! You piece of trash! - Ah, what a waste - You beast! -I hate you! -shut up! Don't hit anymore! Stop! Scumbag, do you want to get beaten too? Wanna fight with me? I wish you were dead! - Stop it - Bastard, bastard. Please, stop it. stop! Ah, so annoying. Do you think you can kill me? Scumbag! What are you doing! Understand the situation, scumbag! Police, police! Understand the situation, kid. Get a grip on the situation! Let me go, let me go. It's all that bitch and her son's fault! Please calm down. Go to hell! - Let go of me! - Please come with us. Ryuzo! Ryuzo! Don't watch! Hey, Shun! long time no see. You're not with Ryuzo's gang anymore, right? Huh? He told me everything. This guy is quite impressive. He's about to become our friend. "friend"? Come with us. Let's go. Well, we've run into a little trouble. Nishino used to give us money, you know? We wanted to find the snitch who told Tokage, and beat him up for money. But he's poor, isn't he? - Damn poor - Shut up. So, we're looking for your cooperation. - Unity is strong. - Quiet. You'll keep it secret for us, won't you? You know what I'm talking about, right? In any case, you have to come up with fifty thousand bucks. Raise fifty grand for us. Then we'll tell you to shut up. Otherwise, Masao will come after us. And you, too. But if everything goes well, I'll ask Masao to let you join us. As for Ryuzo, you don't need to worry. he won't come to school for a while. He got a good beating from his killer father, and he might've been stabbed with a katana. - Is that true? - Of course it is. Let's go. Oh, by the way. We're in charge of the gym equipment room now. you can come too. if you are brave enough. Let's go. I think we should give them the money. We can use our New Year's money and pitch in. Otherwise, we could steal money from our parents. Tokage, you'll have to come up with five thousand. Shun and I will handle the rest. If we don't give him the money, who knows how Masha will deal with us? He might... Actually kill us, who knows. Shun, I'm sorry I moved without telling you. My parents got divorced, so I'm moving in with my mom. I could've gone with my dad too, but I wouldn't have to pay for Akira anymore. And our relationship got really weird. So I quietly transferred schools. But what I did was wrong. In the end, I still avoided the immediate problem. You and your friends accepted me. It's my own lack of trust in you. If I had been a bit braver, believed in you, Maybe things wouldn't have turned out like today. I'm starting to really dislike this version of myself. But, I'm still very happy To have become friends with you and Ryuzo. Really, thank you. I've finished writing our movie script. Everyone has a role. In the final scene, Everyone goes through the tunnel to hell. "We're really going there." Actually, after you and Tokage saw me giving money to Akira, I went alone to the tunnel to hell. I made a wish to have the courage. But I was too scared, I couldn't go in. I can't do it. at least in the movies, I went through it with all of you. I hope that one day, we can make this movie together. By then, I'll confidently be everyone's friend. Goodbye. I still couldn't go into the tunnel, but... Please, give me the courage. Please, please, make my wish come true. Do you know the consequences? Yes. You'll get beaten up by Masao. Then it'll be my turn and Tokage's. Aren't you scared? Of course. But... There are things scarier than that. Are you talking about Ryuzo? Are you really that afraid of him? I... I left Nishino to die. If I give you money now... That would be betraying Ryuzo and the others again. That's... the scariest part. You guys have no idea how terrifying Masha is! Hey, give me the money, please, otherwise he'll kill me. Give me the money, please. Even though you're poor, you can do it. Fifty thousand yen, no problem, right? please... What are you doing? I... I let out a sigh of relief. Why? Honestly, I thought Shun... Was a traitor. The director's in trouble, And you just sit there, Not doing anything. But... now I know. What Ryuzo said was true. Ryuzo? When I told Ryuzo about the director, He said we should believe in you. But I betrayed you all. But, but... You were really cool today. Idiot. You're the coolest one. W-Why? You openly talked to the teacher about giving money to Akira. I would never dare to do that. A-After all, If Ryuzo sees his friends in trouble, He'll definitely help them. I... I also want To be like Ryuzo. Even though I can't. I... Want to be like him. Oh, look at this. Letter and script from Nishino. He's not brave enough either. If we had the courage you have, Maybe he wouldn't have to move away. "I'm really hungry now, feeling terrible." "Eating you would be just right." The lion uses its front paws to hold Emma, curious to see how chubby he is." "Mr. Lion, please..." Wow, you have a big appetite. Did Dad cook for you guys? Occasionally, but it's pretty bad. Mom... she's been reflecting. Reflect on what? About what she said that day. Mom was really too hard on Dad. Actually, Mom used to want to be a writer. Novels? Something like that, or anything else. But I had no talent. After marrying Dad, we moved here. At the time, I was new here, didn't know anyone. I heard you mention it. You didn't have friends back then, felt lonely. Yeah, and I blamed all of that on Dad. But not making friends was actually my problem. Treating the neighbors like rural folks, that's not right. No wonder nobody wanted to interact with me. I always wanted to go back to the past. Didn't want you to be like me. So, I made you learn the piano. I even wanted to send you to cram school, Didn't care if you wanted to or not. But now I'm going to cram school. Do you not want to go? Huh? You don't have to go if you don't want to. Mom doesn't want to keep looking back anymore. Isn't that just a waste of my life? I had to get cancer twice to realize that. Continuing like this, I'll just end up hating myself more and more. Being an adult who hates themselves is miserable. I've said so much, just hoping you won't end up like me. Isn't it strange to hate yourself? Yeah! But it's also hard to like yourself. Wow, you're amazing. How did you suddenly become so wise? Mr. Hidaka, did you hear that? My son is impressive, right? - Very impressive. - Alright, stop it. An immature mother raises a mature child. Do you think Dad likes himself? Dad? I don't think he's ever considered that. That's what makes Dad amazing. But sometimes he really makes me furious. Dad's here! I'm here. Dad's here. What's this? You're eating Mom's health food again. Because I'm really hungry. Dad, I cook delicious meals every night. He says they're hard to swallow. What? What's hard to swallow? Just that it's bad. But he still seems happy eating it. Shrimp... Hmm? My mouth is very skilled! Masao says you guys should be at the quarry on Saturday afternoon at 2. You'll probably get beaten up worse than us. Hmm? You might get beaten up even worse than us. Let's go. Ouch, ouch, ouch, my shoulder hurts. Did Masao really beat them up like this? Definitely. I'll go with you, even though I'm scared. But if it's Ryo, he'll definitely go. But for now, I'm going home. But for now, I'm going home. Long time no see. Yeah. The Tokage gave me this. I always knew the director had talent. Masao wants you to go see him on Saturday? I heard from Tokage. Don't go. You can't possibly beat that monster. Did you tell Tokage? Are you planning to go by yourself? You can fool the naive Tokage, but not me. I'm going too. Don't go. Why? Have you forgotten something? Masao made the appointment for Saturday. Missing a tutoring session once won't matter. I'm not talking cram school. Have you forgotten about your mom's surgery? Oh... I ran into Ako at school, and she told me. She informed me about your mom's cancer relapse and the surgery date. It's not a big deal... I'm sure everything will be fine. I... Really like your mom. Because she's the only one one who treated me and Tokage like regular kids. She pushed me to study hard, and although I found it annoying at first, I have her to thank for taking my studies seriously. She's having surgery; you should be at the hospital with her. But, what about Nishino... You idiot, I don't care at all about that. Even if you don't care, I still feel guilty. Back then, I betrayed all of you. You trusted me so much... Actually, I didn't trust you enough. I always felt like I wasn't a true friend to you all. it's hard to explain. I'm the only one with a normal family. All of you... Tokage, Shotaro, and you. You've all had it tough. I'm the exception. So... I want to become a true friend to you. I really want to be someone you can trust. I never thought you weren't my friend. You not being able to trust me, that's my fault. So, I want to go alone to make you trust me more. you... Why do you always have to be so tough? I... think you're amazing. But honestly, sometimes I just can't understand you. Now... I still don't understand. I... I want to be normal like you. I... don't want to be the son of a murderer. I don't want to be like my dad or my mom. Once my mom left, I was left with my terrifying dad. You saw that day, didn't you? my dad got drunk and went crazy. I thought he was going to kill me. Look at my face. That time... I really want to kill him. ... my dad... Swung a knife. I knew it... I'm the son of a murderer. But... But... but i... I don't want this! I want to be a normal kid! Just like you! So, every time I pray in front of the tunnel to hell: "Please let me become a normal person." But I'm too scared to run through that tunnel. If I run through it and nothing changes, I'll still be... A terrible kid born to terrible parents! I don't care about my friends at all. I only care about myself! I just want to be a normal person! To become a good person! So I'll go alone. I know. we all know. We know. Be careful. It's alright, see you later. If there's a later... No! Mom... Don't say such things. Excuse me for a moment. Mom... It's okay, see you later. Mom... - We should get going soon. - Alright. We need to push the stretcher. Goodbye, farewell. See you in the next life. In the next life... Dad, she said in the next life. It's okay, it's okay, don't listen to her nonsense. I... I'll go by myself. Idiot, don't try to be strong. Ryuzo also came... I saw it. Start from the right, state your name. name! Shun Takasaki. Dear, your voice sounds like a little girl's. Do you want to go home and suck on mommy's milk? Make a cock stand up? Next one! name. Hiroki Matsukata! Matsukata Hiroki, come here! Do you think I'll be afraid just because you said a yakuza's name? Speaking of which, your dad was a yakuza too. Your mouth smells so bad. Huh, what? Say it again, little brother. I said your mouth smells bad! I can't hear you. Clean your earwax and shut up! useless guy. Hey, wake up. Do you want to go home and see your murderer dad? Bring him here, I'll let him die with you. I'll kill you. I am going to kill you! Ah, I'm so scared, he said he's going to kill me. Let's see what he's got. What's that? I'll kill all of you... Ryuzo. Ryuzo? Hey, little brother. It's not good to swing a knife around. I'll kill all of you... Yeah, that's dangerous. Ryuzo? I'll kill all of you... Ryuzo! You scum! Ouch, it hurts! Hurts, hurts, hurts! Give it to me! i am Rambo. i am Rambo. Ah, I must kill all of you! Hey, hey, why did you betray me? Go to hell! You bastard. How did you end up on our side? Idiot. I stand on the side of justice. And you? I... stand on the side of the strongest. How about that? I'm the world's biggest coward! You're the universe's number one. I'm... Transferring schools. I'm moving to live with my mom. She's in Osaka. Why? My dad... Told me to go. You... Go live with your mom then. Study well. Live a good life. If it were you, you could definitely do it. At least aim for Tokyo University. So you guys better work hard to get into Tokyo University. Other than me, it's impossible for anyone else. Then you can be everyone's tutor, and everyone will become amazing. Win the Nobel Prize, go to outer space. outer space? I don't know, then become the president. The US has a president. Then you be the president of the US. Shun can be the president of France or something. Everyone becomes president in different countries. Then I'll be the president of Europe. Europe isn't a single country. what about me? You can be the Prime Minister of Japan. Japan only has a Prime Minister. Enough with the chatter. So, Shun, you better work hard to get into a private high school. You might have to make a wish at the tunnel to hell for that. Then make a wish for me too. Let's go. Is the food Dad cooks tasty? Yeah, it's delicious! - Is it as delicious as what I cook? - Even better! Oh, then I won't cook anymore, Dad's is better. - Dad's cooking is better, right? - Yeah! Mom's cooking is better! Oh, where's Shun? Is he still sleeping? Ryuzo is leaving today. Ah, right, I'll go wake him up. Ouch, it hurts, it hurts. Shun, wake up! - Dad's cooking is better, right? - Yeah! Everyone, thanks for being good friends to Ryuzo. We'll miss you. Mischievous kids are the hardest to let go of. Teacher Shoko, be careful with Teacher Uchida. He's interested in you. Hey! Impossible, impossible. What's impossible? How is it impossible? - It's impossible, impossible. - Stop saying that! Shun hasn't come yet Wh... why? He might have remembered the wrong date. Or did he betray us again? Idiot, he's not like you. Alright, you guys go home. Idiot, we haven't seen you cry yet. Idiot, there are things you can't see. Tokage, don't let them look down on you anymore. You need to go to school properly. i...i will. And you, don't betray your friends again. Who am I supposed to betray? - Don't betray me. - I won't. Akira, you've never won a fight against me. Bastard, let's fight now then. - Sure. - Alright, alright, it's already this late. Shotaro, you should teach them to study. Yeah, I think teaching them won't work. Yeah, they're beyond saving! - Right, Teacher Shoko? - They can still be saved. Goodbye! Ah, the teacher is here too. Oh, where's Shun? He hasn't come. Is he not at home? He left early in the morning. Oh, that idiot, where did he run off to? Thanks for taking care of them. I'll ask Shun to write back to you. I'll also ask Ryuzo to write. Take care. goodbye. Keep up the good work. Don't go, don't go. Don't go, please don't go. - Wait a moment. - Wait a moment. Don't forget me. Ryuzo! Ryuzo! Ryuzo! Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye! Hey! Shun! Shun! Shun! Ryuzo! Ryuzo! - Shun... - Ryuzo... - Shun... - Ryuzo... Shun... Ryuzo... Shun... - Shun... - Ryuzo... - Shun... - Ryuzo... Shun... Ryuzo... Ryuzo... Ryuzo... Ryuzo... Ryuzo... Ryuzo...
