When your lover starts talking about being loyal to your husband, you can be sure that it's the first move towards leaving you. Because now he says to me, "We can't. It seems vulgar." "Are you kidding? With a friend?" Hypocrite! Liar! You can imagine... But if that cuckold husband of mine... that big cuckold husband of mine knows it very well. He is terrorized they'll talk about it, or write it in the papers. With a scandal, he'd have to say goodbye to the Senate! So he's quiet. Being senator of the kingdom is worth an adulteress wife. We were going back home in the car. I was sitting between the cushions... already furious... my husband, and him. He didn't glance once at me. Or even touch me to calm me down! He starts talking about politics with the senator. I don't exist. Your wife's lover is convenient, if he's the Duke of Bagnasco. He could be an influential voter. Both naked in the closet. What? Doesn't it make you laugh? "It's a duty to become senator", my husband shouts. "Parliament today is shameful." To spite me, he starts being polemic, he talks about fighting, about educating the masses. What does he know about masses? At least the cuckold is coherent. "Bagnasco, the crowd is vile. A decision must be taken, a gesture." "A gesture, Bagnasco." I made that gesture, because I lost my head and put my hand on his co... To avoid seeing this, my husband turned around, and Bagnasco struck me, and hit the teeth of my Pekinese dog, poor Pingpong, who was in my arms. My darling! She had nothing to do with it. You should have heard how much she yelped! Those two in the corner, at the end on the left. I said in the corner at the end on the left! They come every evening. Mr. Ghiondelli and his girlfriend. - Good evening. - Good evening. Thank you. It was a night of hell, Duke. The telephone rang all night. The baroness sent the coachman twice, and the chauffeur once with these notes. She demanded an immediate answer. None of the servants went to sleep... You are paid for this, too. Yes, to defend my sleep. The invitations for this evening. No invitations for this evening. I won't stay home. I'm dining out. My respects, Excellency. I assure you it will become a delightful country home. You'll see! I don't want to have a holiday in a church. It's not a church, it's a parsonage. Excuse me. What would you do if a grandmother left you a parsonage as inheritance? Worse happened to me. I inherited a palatine chapel with a reliquary of saints that don't exist on the calendar anymore. - You made a blunder. - It's not a blunder. - It's a family privilege. - He does many. You'll see. Anyway, I never go there on vacation. - You see? - Please be quiet, Manuela. Listen, Duke, my grandmother left the villa on the sea to nuns, and a parsonage on the Apennines to me. I'll turn it into a vacation home. - It's right. - What fun to sleep with the Christs! - What Christs? - There's surely a painted Christ! Transforming it is the best idea. I think he is right. Mr... Excuse me. Martino Ghiondelli and my fiancée, Manuela Roderighi. - Daniele Bagnasco. - We know who you are, Duke. It is so big! Alright, thank you. Why do they bring pheasants with feathers, and not the hens? They should bring hens with feathers, too. I know of beautiful ones. Let's see what we can do to please your fiancée. - Demolish the church completely. - We haven't seen it yet! - I don't want to see it. - Homes are transformed nowadays. It's the fashion. Many French abbeys are now beautiful homes. If your parsonage has lovely trusses, a rose window facing the mountains, you can turn it into a magnificent living room. See? Just as I said. What if there aren't trusses and a rose window? The lady is atrociously pessimistic. What about seeing this blessed parsonage before making a decision? Yes! Or not? Look at the dust. There's even... What a mess! It doesn't open here. My God! Wait here because there's a lot of dust. - Are you angry? - Why? Because I dragged you all this way. There is a reason. Would you like to become my lover? Why not? If Ghiondelli agrees, since we're getting married this year. Ask him. You are mistaken! Maybe my fiancé’s exuberance or my condescendence led to a misunderstanding. Now I see why you were so willing to help. Who do you think I am? Manuela is right. Unfortunately, she is always right. Dear Duke, there are no rose windows or trusses, or windows. I think the only thing left to do is demolish it. We've been saying for months that provocation must not be accepted, that even cowardice is a duty. - Meanwhile, Mussolini... Nobody dreams of resisting. Come on, people, to the rescue! Socialism will triumph. Danì! Stop. You remember my name. - Where are you going? - Just taking a ride. - Is someone waiting for you? - I am alone and getting bored. You want to come to my place? - What for? - Come to my home and see. - You want to ruin my ride? - Yes. The Bagnasco building, please. - What are you doing there? - Do you need anything, Duke? - Go, Pasqualino. I'll call you. - Excuse me. He's been with me since I was born. You are so lovely! You are divine. That fiancé... He's your lover, right? The first? The only? How many lovers have you had? One? Three? - Five? - Give me back the cigarette. You want to keep that secret? You can tell me. I'm not jealous. Miss Dolly Carol, Baroness Dolores Massimi. Duchess De Flavis. - Hi. - Senator, how are you? Pleased to meet you. Let's go. I gave a dance, not a safari! Let's have the performance at my home! Danì! May you be damned, Danì! Take her home. You didn't see anything. Nothing happened. Check. Call. Call. I heard that a gunshot is going around Rome looking for a receiver. I heard about it too. People say many useless things. I wouldn't want that shot to find a target, sooner or later. - What're you doing here? - Are you alone? I wouldn't say so. My friends, Gian Riccardo Montieri, Lodovico Della Notte, Lanfranco Selpa, a hunter in Africa. - No woman? - Yes! Elena, the governess. May I? I'll check. Gentlemen... - When a pope dies another is elected. - Wow, what a temperament! Life is a hell! Nobody is here. Then I missed my shot. Surprising you was useless. - I don't understand. Explain that. - I had sure information. You have another steady lover. Not the one who said goodbye with a gun shot. - You know that too. - We know all about you in Rome. Alright. It's probable I have another girlfriend. I appreciate your honesty. Her name is Cecilia Folchi. I don't receive her at home. Don't bother me anymore. Keep your Cecilia, and have her dress better! You want the house key? You can come when you want and... It's useless to go to the home of a man who sees his lovers outside his home! I won't... I won't be the lid to your scandals! No, I don't love you. I like you very much. But I don't love you. Maybe I will never love you. Why are you saying this? No one asked you. I don't love you. I don't love you. I like you very much. But I don't love you. Maybe I will never love you. - Will you have me accompanied? - I gave orders for the carriage. - Will you come back tomorrow? - No, I can't tomorrow. I live with an aunt, and tomorrow we're visiting some people. Well? - When will I see you? - The day after tomorrow at 3. I have to be home in the evening. - Ghiondelli must not suspect. - Of course. Dear Danì, my love, I remember with fondness our affectionate kisses. Forgive me if I don't come tonight. I am exhausted. It was strange last night. Did you see the friends I introduced to you? Usually when they come here, we play poker, and I always win. But last night was a disaster. I wasn't ever lucky, and suddenly you came. Strange, huh? Do you believe in that old proverb that says, "Who is unlucky at cards, is fortunate in love"? - Bye. - Bye? I had second thoughts. I won't come the day after tomorrow either. - What happened? - Nothing. I said I won't come the day after tomorrow, either. - When, then? - I don't know. Manuela! - Do you want to leave me? - Maybe. - What did I do to you? - I don't owe you an explanation. Do as you wish. I'll wait for you. I am always home at 3. Goodbye. Good-day, Duke. - Is the professor home? - He's in the laboratory. - What are you doing here? - I wanted to see you. Then sit down and take that stuff off. Have lunch here. It's country food, nothing sophisticated. No city poisons! They follow fashion too. Know that? - Who? - Poisons. Modern men want to kill themselves with fashionable poisons. Cocaine is now the fashion, along with morphine, heroin. There. If someone like you commits suicide, he should use a unique poison. You can't commit suicide like an ordinary noble. You need something more... For example... Opisthotonus... a fabulous death. Know what happens? With a contraction of muscles behind your neck and those of your back. The body takes on the position of... of a bridge, leaning on heels and back of neck. - That's funny. Funny? Sensational! Cytotoxin. You always do the same things. Meals, dinners, evenings at the theatre. The club after the theatre, the dances, parties, women, sluts. What a bore! Look. You're the portrait of boredom. - Did you like my "fettuccine"? - Magnificent. As I was telling you, I can't forgive myself for being three days closed at home. - You? - Yes, me. Me. Closed at home waiting for that idiot. She wants to speculate on your boredom to create a new interest. Don't you understand? I must tell you that? Maybe I want to exploit her too, to create a new interest. - Who knows! - Who knows! Who knows! Who knows! Under how many "who knows" are tons of useless lives buried? Listen, do something. Send your chauffeur to Rome. Have two coaches of clothes brought and stay here in the country with me. You look like a corpse. Look at me! Come on! Taking a break will be good for you. Welcome back! Was your life in the country lovely, Duke? It makes you go senile, my dear. You sleep, you yawn. You die of boredom in the country. There are no roads, no invitations, no women, no dances. Yes, my dear, a truly absurd life, an immoral one. The first days were hell. I slept the other six. - So many sheep in the country! - No, not here. I prefer city life. If I must get bored, I want to do so with my home comforts. Duke. Miss Roderighi came looking for you twice. You were at her home! You're Cecilia Folchi's lover, that blond flirt, that kept woman who wears clothes that she invents! How can you love such a woman? - Aren't you ashamed? - I was at Marco Pisani's. - I don't know him. - You will. I don't want to meet your friends! Alright. You were in the country. I don’t want to contradict you, but with your lover, Cecilia Folchi! Will you listen to me a minute? It's over with Cecilia Folchi. The letter? "Forgive me if I don't come this evening. I'm exhausted." "I will fall asleep thinking of your sweet kisses." You laugh? I'll look for it in your bedroom. I burned it with the other ones before leaving. What a coincidence! - Want to talk about your fiancé? - Don't touch Ghiondelli! You met me with him, knew we were engaged, and you wanted me. I don't know your lovers, and will end up having to put up with them! You men are children who want everything. I learned that at 15! At 15? I was an idiot at that age. I believed anything I was told. That man seemed like a good friend of the family, as my aunt said. I always lived with her. My mother has a nervous problem. She lives in Milan, I rarely see her. One day the three of us left for Milan. Halfway through the trip, my aunt gets sick with a liver colic. The dear family friend proposes to stop at Reggio Emilia where he has a villa. "We'll continue the trip tomorrow", he says. During the night he came into the bedroom and raped me. When I returned to Rome, I was his lover. Since then, he's always persecuted me. Our relationship was one of blackmail. He was married, but his wife lived in Paris more than in Rome. Who is this scoundrel? Who cares? You don't know him. Once I even fired a shot at him. Bang! - What is his name? Tell me. - What for? Is it possible that I know him? I will find out, even without looking for him. So many secrets in here! We are like fireflies. We shine in the dark. Slaves of a cruel world. We are the flowers of Evil... Duke! Stop! Stop! The Duke of Bagnasco is here. Put it in reverse, go on! Manuela, did you see him? Come on! Stop here. Do you need help? Did your car break down? I'll call Gaspare. Gaspare, come! I was trying it. It's up for sale. - I think that Elio can do it. - Manuela, the duke is here. What's wrong with the car? It's the water! - A pleasure to see you again. - How are you? It'll take more than a half hour. Come to our home for lunch. We'll all go to the Blue Trout. Your chauffeur can join us. These are my friends. Augusto Rovari, Giuseppe Longarola, Digo... Digo! - Alright, Digo Faustini. Come. - But your car is already full. Sit next to Manuela. Digo, get in the front. Let the duke go in. Augusto, you, there. Giuseppe, in the back. Everything all set? Listen, chauffeur! See you at the Blue Trout! Three kilometers to the right, and then ask. Alright? Go! We are like fireflies. We shine in... My God! How disgusting! See how it moved? Little fish, my dear, come here. - Very good. - Bravo, Orsina! Bravo, you too. You were exceptional. What a lovely trout! I will start again. Silence. "We had begun to eat under the pergola in the garden," "when next to another table," "we see a man covered with blood." To health! "How my friends have become," "those I had kept close to me," "and that I had loved very much." "The other man had run away. They call..." "They hurriedly call a coachman. Meanwhile, a policeman arrives" "with the other man they had grabbed, and says," "By God! Pull out the knife!" - "After looking a long time..." - Daniele! Come have coffee with us. We must save poor Danì. "Just imagine us!" "After that scene, goodbye picnic," "and we had to eat the oven baked chicken for dinner." - Bravo! - You're better than Petrolini! Excuse me. - Who are they? Explain the matter. - What matter? It involves a woman. - Who is she? - I barely know her. Her name is Roderighi, I believe. Doesn't she look Italian? She's typical. You barely know her? Oh, please! So why do you associate with those strange people? I have to buy a car. That young man is a salesman. We came up here to test it. Who does the new one belong to? I think this isn't a problem. It belongs to whoever wants it. I think I'll buy both of them. This is American music! It's American music! This is how you dance it. Look! One, one... Dance! Are you embarrassed? The days of waltz are over. Come on, guys! One, one, one! Come on! Come on, Manuela! You like it? Digo! Are making a pass at her? He's making a pass at her! - Don't joke around. - You are making a pass at her! You're watching? You like Roderighi, huh? At least we know her name now. We haven't seen each other for a long time, Daniele. Right. You never come to see me. I'll come to see you. - He wasn't expecting to see us here. - Yes. Excellency. Goodbye. - You're leaving? Please, stay. - My car is ready. Tomorrow at 3. With the excuse of the kiss of a hand... Darn you! - The duke? Where is he? - There he is. Duke! Is he leaving? Duke! - Goodbye. - Goodbye. An elegant bachelor's car! It's perfect for combined escapes. You got off your cars. You should do one of these sports. They keep you alert, with open eyes. Did you buy it? The new car? Yes, I bought it. You seemed to be in a bad mood yesterday. I was like a fish out of water. I had just met the group a few hours earlier. - Will you stay with me for lunch? - No, I'm busy. - When will you come see me? - Today, if you want. Very well. Come today at 5. At 5. What kind of people do you associate with? What kind of fiancé is Ghiondelli? Does he understand or not? Does he think he's navigating in a spaceship all of his own, or is he content with having a seat on board? What an idiot! I was about to ask you to choose! You can keep him if you want. It's convenient for you, I know. Only an imbecile like him could marry a slut like you! I hope you know what you're worth. Look at yourself! You know what your beauty is worth? And that Faustini! If he dare behave as he did in front of me... I can't live like this. I am going out of my mind! Duke, Marquis Barra. It's too late. Pasqualino, I didn't think I'd find you here. - How old are you? - Who remembers! Why don't you come see us anymore? - Rome is increasingly far away. - Yes, for a countryman like me. - Why doesn't the marquis ever come? - Pasqualino. My cousin, Michele Barra, Manuela Roderighi. I noticed the lady yesterday at the Blue Trout. Shall we sit down? Please, have a seat. Is Yvonne in Paris? His wife only comes to Rome for family funerals and weddings. In fact, she is in Paris, waiting for the next funeral or the next wedding. We haven't seen each other in a long time. We've much to ask each other. What about your lands? Aren't you worried with all these reforms? Reforms? Let the Socialists talk. They have few hours left. The Fascists are controlling them. With Ordine Nuovo everything will be ok. As for my villa... I want to get rid of my villa near Reggio. You're right. Our family villas only give us worries. - In fact. - And above all, bad memories. Not always. They are often tied to memories you can't forget. It would be too much to lose a good deal for faraway sentimental reasons. If some nouveau riche offers me lots of money, I'll give it to him. - You're not offering me a drink? - Excuse me. - Your usual champagne or tea? - Champagne. You accuse me of having been used, assaulted, blackmailed? I realized it yesterday, at the trattoria. He looked at you as if he were your master, a jealous master. He keeps on looking at you that way! Didn't you see him earlier? I think you are crazy. Why did you do this? I'd kept him away a long time! Now he will have the right to stop me when I meet him. Why did you do it? I love you, Manuela. Do you realize that I love you? - I won't leave you! Why should I? - Because I am asking you. I don't want to hurt you, dear. Certainly not you. I don't know. I... I should leave you free for a man who's crazy about you. wants you all to himself, demands things, and promises nothing? I know. I know, but I love him. That is the truth. I love him. It's my fault. I am so stupid. I never understand a thing. If I had kept my eyes open, I'd have saved you from this situation. Probably. Listen, let's forget everything and start over again. Of course. Someone like you would be convenient. Someone who forgives me, who excuses me, and who will marry me. But I don't feel up to it. I would only hurt you, and I don't want that. I don't want to hurt anyone. These are the winners? What a waste! Tonight we're all going to dinner... - Excuse me. - Duchess. Everyone to dinner at Colonna's. Want to come? - Who is "everyone"? - Selva, Montieri, Raffaelli, Barra. Bring Roderighi. - Roderighi? - Yes, your... Would you be happy if I brought Roderighi? - Do you have a crush on her? - Me? Do I look like the type? I like Roderighi, but it's a whim that's fading away. She is seen with you in the car, with you in the carriage... It's not convenient! - May we talk? - You can always talk to me. In love with Roderighi! Keep her home as much as you wish, but don't take her out. Tamarindo? Waiter! Two tamarindos, please. Thank you. People think it's something serious. Duchess of Bagnasco. We know that Manuela can be gotten for a certain amount in Fernanda Fonés' home. Our friends sent you to open my eyes. I understand, Armellino. An affection plot, but there was no need. Please, Count. It's not just gossip. You see, Duke? I changed the position of the mirror. I put flowers, and this marvelous black tent. As for the rest, the room remained the same, the one you preferred. We have a novelty. Electric light over the bed. It wasn't necessary. For a long time I haven't had the honor of receiving you here. Did you betray me? - There's unfair competition. - Listen, Fernanda. - I want some information. - Happy to serve you, if I can. I noticed a girl who I am very interested in. It's not easy to get close to her because often she is accompanied. Her name is... Wait a moment. What is her name? Maybe you know her. Manuela, I think. Roderighi. Of course, I know her. You want an appointment, right? Alright! Today is Thursday. The time it takes, with some caution. I hope to set it up for Saturday. - Is that alright? - Saturday. You are a demon. - How did you meet her? - I want to tell you the truth. A gentleman brought her, one of your men. - Marquis Barra? - Then you know everything. You thought of exploiting her and one day made her an offer. Then another one. You are... - I've no words to say what you are. - I am the best! It's not enough. We need to invent a word for you. You come, you leave, you return when least expected. I'll warn you right away. Don't try the country experiment again. I won't accept. No. I'm leaving right away. I was worried. I'd heard nothing about you for a long time. Since when are you so caring? I thought you didn't feel well. You are crazy. It's useless to be nice with you. I've never seen you so pale. Will you get me a cigarette? No, the others. In my room. - These? - Thank you. You don't want to talk? Must I interpret your silence? If you've something to say to me, do so. Whatever comes from you can't be bad. - Is the duke alive? - What? - I am asking if he's ill. - I don't think so. - He gave orders not to disturb him. - I want to see him just the same. He's sleeping, with the lady. You are crazy! Did you leave them in there together? Professor, I can't. I order you to advise him right away. Understand? Some is missing here. On the floor? Did you steal it to throw it on the carpet? Maybe it is true. Why is it so spread out? How did you dilute it? You want to know too much. I thought you were my friend. Why did you steal it? - You don't want to answer? - No. Give me your word that you didn't hide the poison that's missing. Come on! You want to see Manuela? I'll call her. - She is resting. - I don't want to meet her! I apologize. In certain moments I lose my head and... And even the smallest gossip makes me pounce. And I do things that astonish me. Forgive me. Enough. We've tortured ourselves enough today. - Is tomorrow at 4 alright? - Yes, dear. - Was the person advised? - Yes, last night. - Did she accept tomorrow at 4? - Yes, tomorrow at 4. Good evening, Duke. Duke. Miss Roderighi is on the phone asking for you. My cousin must buy some things. She's not from Rome. I must accompany her. I'll be there at six. Alright, dear? Bye. No, Danì, no! Don't be afraid. I'm not armed. I am full of shame. Take pity. Let me go. You'll never see me again! - Why do you come here? For money? - Yes, yes, yes. Then... earn it. Get undressed. Get undressed! Couldn't I give you what you needed? Couldn't you sell my jewels? Jewels aren't worn here! You're crazy! A liar! Michele Barra had you take your first steps as a prostitute here, and you're up to your ears in it. You've reached rock bottom! You're a slut! Slut! I'll kill you when it's the right moment. You'll surely give me the occasion to do so. If there is a culprit, and there is, he must pay. Dinner is served. I was reading in the paper about a woman, a well-to-do woman, found in a brothel. I was wondering why a woman like her, married, who probably had a lover, someone who adored her, should prostitute herself. Maybe because she hates men. She despises them. Write. Dear Michele, I am a prisoner of Danì now. He took me far away from everyone. I need your help. But be cautious. I will advise you as soon as we can meet. You must excite him, and then humiliate him. Get his hopes up, and then reject him. You should flatter him, torture him. You must pretend you love him, but that you are afraid of me and can't show it. Then the following day you must pretend with me a love that makes you forget him. You think I need to pretend? Give him appointments that you don't go to. You must bring Michele to a state of desperation. - You want your revenge? - You will give it to me. Thank you. - You're crazy to come! Danì is here. - You wrote me on hotel stationery. - Hotel stationery? I know. You did it without thinking. Your usual tricks! - I could happen to go to a hotel. - You shouldn't have come. - You need my help, dear. - Don't get so friendly with me. - Nobody hears us here. You're mine. - Go away. I'll look for you. Our love ended too soon, and badly. I behaved in a vile way, but I never stopped loving you. I'll have you again. I bet my life on it. Here's the result of your letter, Michele Barra is here. What'll we do? We ruined our vacation. Is he already here? You purposely sent hotel stationery! You don't want to live in peace, and don't think of me. Don't you think I'm suffering? I can't stand it anymore! - Did you already talk to him? - He talked to me. God, how I hate men! One has me, the other wants me and tortures himself. What should I do? Write him a note. That you told me about his presence in the hotel and... I invite him to lunch with us tomorrow. It's for you. Open it. Something is written on it. Read it. "You're like a lamb among wolves." Danì, What are you doing? Seeing how lovely the sea is? I'd like to go inside. The sun bothers me. Will you excuse us? He rented an apartment in the city. We've an appointment tomorrow. I'll pretend to go somewhere, but I'll go to him. Maybe to another brothel! What did you answer? Yes. I postponed the appointment till after tomorrow. Very good. We're going back to Rome tomorrow evening. I'm glad! I can't stand this big act. Pretending to cheat on you with him is disgusting. I'm sorry, but in Rome we must continue the big act. - Stop! - Marquis Barra says to stop. Hey, you! - Don't make a fool of me like this. - You want a scandal? - Where can we meet? - I don't know. - Is the Caffè Greco alright? - Yes, tomorrow. At one. Nobody is ever there. See you tomorrow. Go! - May I go, Miss? - Go on. So I committed a crime. Well, I'm proud of it. The others had you as a lover, but only I had you as a virgin and innocent. - You're already drunk. A coffee. What's with this making a fool of the only man of your life? Who is he? Listen. You were different down there. What happened? You gave me an appointment and then left. I accepted it because I knew I was leaving. Why did you ask for my help? It was a moment of weakness. Maybe I feared Danì's love was too exclusive and would suffocate me. Then I realized I love him, and will never cheat on him. I made a mistake. I apologize. You're making a fool of me. You like to see me in this state. - In what state? - You'll find out. - You didn't forget me. - Of course not! - You still remember my kisses. - Yes, but accompany me to Danì. The following day you confessed that making love was beautiful. - Will you accompany me to Danì? - Does he caress you as I did? Of course. He loves me. I love you too, and won't accompany you to Danì. You are a coarse, vulgar man, without a heart! - Did you see him? - Yes. - At Caffè Greco. - What did he say to you? Love words... many. - He loves me and is suffering. - Good. It's what we wanted. Tomorrow you'll go back. - I won't come to you anymore. - Why? I won't come anymore. I'm tired. - Why? - I told you that I'm tired! You think it's enough for me, that I'll give up, and step aside? I don't want to see you again! I received an invitation from Danì. Tomorrow evening I'm dining with you. Good. You'll see me with him. You'd like that, huh? A spectator of your domestic joys. Don't come, and it won't happen. I will be grateful. No. Tomorrow I'm having dinner at your home. Then you'll come to me. Madman! I give myself to you just to have you for dinner? I'm not kidding. If you don't come, I'll shoot myself. I'll wait 15 minutes for you. I swear on my mother's memory. It would be wonderful, if it were true. You look thinner, Michele. You don't look so good. Why is that? - I am in love. - In love, how tender! He's in love! Remember when he fell in love with Pampaloni? Night owl and horny. You won't tell us with who? A passion without a name, like a blank promissory note. - You're an expert. - On passion or promissory notes? Passion without a name. And pure, like a bride. Is that why you don't drink? It'll be better that way, Michele. You'll see. Now we'll toast to our divine lady, an incredible host. When I fell in love, it was a disaster. Because the lovely shrew didn't want me, even for a good laugh. - Not even to cry. - Right. I followed her everywhere. In theaters, in clubs, horse races. I gave her lots of chocolates. - She threw them at you. - No, she ate them. Not like that. It's wrong. One, two, three, four. Like this. You're a disaster, Danì. I gave her a bracelet that she wore, a ring that she wore. A pearl bracelet and a pearl necklace. - She wore that too. - She wore everything on. Everything, everything, everything. It was an uncontrollable vice. I even wanted to send her a villa, but my father forbid it. Then, how could she wear that? Maybe, one brick at a time... I know the signature on that promissory note. - You want a coffee, Marquis? - Yes, black. - And you, Count? - No, thank you. He's destroyed. He's done for. I wrote to her every day, 3 times a day. She sent the letters back without reading them. Certain letters shouldn't be written or opened. Are you hinting at something? You have second thoughts? Via Cavour, 12. Tomorrow. You know how it ended up, Michele? I killed them. But just as all invented suicides, it wasn't successful. I had exchanged the veronal with a laxative! Stop at number 12. - This is number 12. - Please, wait for me here. Stop. Don't get close. Doubting if it was a big act, I preferred being generous. - Don't make me regret it. - No, you're not leaving from here. A moment of madness and... Bang! Bang! - Don't get closer. Keep away! - I want to kiss you. Stay there! I was writing to my brother, the truth. If I'd been late, you'd have died for someone who doesn't love you. Who cares? I love you. - Goodbye. - Will you come some other day? - What if I don't let you go? - You won't. Goodbye. It should've ended as I had planned. A miserable love story, but marvelous, that ends without a worthy conclusion. - What were you hoping for? - Nothing. Not even your visit. - Will you be foolish, and try again? - No. You destroyed the moment. - Do you still love me? - I'd obey you if I didn't love you? Would I let you go? Enough. Come here. There... That's it. For me... you will always remain the divine girl you were then. You're so strange, in disorder. Where did you go? I woke up late. - Michele? - I saw him. - At Caffè Greco again? - Where else? - Yesterday too? - Yes, dear. Did you meet the day before yesterday too? - Yes, I say! - It's not true! The day before yesterday I went to Caffè Greco from one to two. You two weren't there. Where do you two hide? Why are you lying, Manuela? No! I'm not lying. Where should we hide? You are confusing me. We didn't meet the day before yesterday. Oh, God, what a torment! This life has become hell. No! Excuse me, I have a headache. I feel like I'm going crazy! So, did you tell him? No. He'll kill me. I can't stand it anymore! Let's go! Let's go! Let's leave and go abroad. You and I alone. We'll disappear. I want you all to myself. - He'll either kill me or himself. - So we'll go on like this? - 2 hours with me, the rest with him. - Don't take it out on me. - Give me time to see what to do. - Fast. You must hurry! Or I'll go to Danì and throw the truth in his face! Try it, and it will all be over! Miss Roderighi. - Who is it? - You know my name. - I'm Marco Pisani. - What do you want from me? - What is it? - Some people know about your dates with Michele Barra, the time, address... Otherwise, how would I be here? Let's get off the street. Get in the carriage with me. Why does Armellino want a tragedy to take place? Armellino wants Danì to open his eyes. That is why he's shouting it everywhere. I heard about it, and I live in the country! I don't understand you. You say you love Danì. - But you're Michele Barra's lover. - I was obliged. - Sure, obliged! - He would have killed himself. He wasn't lying. When I went to him, he was writing to his brother and the gun was on the table! You shouldn't have gone. You would found out what sort of person he is. Don't go to Via Cavour anymore. The rumors will cease and everything will go back as it was. Think of Danì, of our friend. I must say, your love seems monstrous. You get your hopes up, dear Danì. On the other hand, I... I'm not so much against it. They have a strong hand. We'll have to deal with the Fascists, sooner or later. The Italians are in need. Too bad they are such roughnecks, middle class, and rude. - You can't associate with them. - I don't know how to classify you! I'm not a Fascist yet. You're just a big scoundrel, a spy! - Manuela, are you kidding? - No, I'm not. He goes around saying I'm Michele Barra's lover, that we meet from noon till two in an apartment in Via Cavour. He boasts that he spies on me. He talks to doormen and shopkeepers. Coward! - Who answers for her? - I do, naturally. He even wants to be a hero. Go away, miserable man! Look at what you did, miss! - This is out of this world. - Will you fight with that scoundrel? The decision is up to our godfathers. Roderighi isn't worth the blow from the sword that you'd give me, or I'd give you. But since she said I was a scoundrel and a coward, I am obliged to do it. Danì, I'm not lying. It's the truth. Roderighi meets with Michele Barra. They meet from noon till two, in an apartment. Via Cavour, 12. If you want, you can see for yourself. Go there and see. Manuela is a girl you notice, and you know that. You'll find someone who saw her and can testify. I didn't lie to you when I said she worked at Fonés' home, and I'm not lying now. - Would you put that in writing? - In front of witnesses and lawyers. Excellency. Excellency, don't get me in trouble. Someone could come here any minute. These are delicate matters. Thank you! Come, Excellency. You have a white carnation in your buttonhole. - Michele gave it to me. - He isn't capable of these gestures. - You wrongly accuse him. - Don't kid around. You had better confess. What should I confess? That you betrayed me in an indignant and sleazy way. You are Michele Barra's lover. Why did you give in to Michele? Why did you go from hatred to love? It's the filthy slander of a scoundrel! Armellino doesn't lie, as he didn't lie when he told me that you went to Fonés' home. - Instead of believing a scoundrel, you should have gone to the house in Via Cavour. It's an idea! But I didn't go, and I won't. I'm sorry. You would have verified my innocence. Are you so sure of your innocence? Armellino, who is so sure of himself, should have put his slander in writing! So what? A man who lies when speaking can do so in writing too. I'd like to go home. I'm devastated. See you tomorrow, dear. It's better. It will be another day. We'll spend it together. Remember when I slapped you? Yes. I had put poison in your tea. You wanted to kill me? You would be capable of doing that. Did a tall dark haired man with blue eyes ask for me and Marquis Barra? - I didn't say anything. You were to show him the apartment. I sent him. - Yes, I showed it to him. - Was everything in order? - Where there white carnations? - Yes, as usual. Everything was in order. I even had to open the window. It's convenient to have a Bagnasco behind the door. Auntie, don't make me say anything else. I'll leave you the jewels. You deserve them. Not these. I earned them, and I won't tell you how. You can't run away like this. I lived the life of Barra, of Ghiondelli, of Bagnasco, yours! - Now I want to live mine. - I wanted you to be... Maybe a duchess. It didn't go so badly for you. - You're a shameful woman! - Yes. Now you'll have to cease not seeing and not knowing anything. It's too convenient to pretend. I think he won't find her. It's useless to involve policemen and detectives. Only she... knows where she is. We are talking about comforting one and the other. For sure! Poor Auntie lost a nice income. Who will comfort Michele Barra? He doesn't need cocaine to forget. He surely found an outlet to his beastliness. Excuse me. In the hotel registrar, they were Miss Teodora Landon and Miss Regina Hargrave. The brunette, who looks like this portrait, was called Hargrave. Miss Manuela. Danì is desperately looking for you. What? What are you saying? I don't understand. It was her. In fact, after two hours the girls had left Paris. Cheers for wine that is sincere. It chases away all worries and drowns bad moods in trembling inebriation. Cheers for wine that is sincere. Champagne! - Look at this! - Yes, that's it. Champagne! To health! A nice toast. Swallow, whore. Did you ever take a bath in champagne? Look at those two! With all the strawberries they ate! Who are we? What is he doing? Taking the strawberries away? Stop it! Stop! Let go. Let go! What are you doing? Looking? Go work! You realize that? He wants to take them away. You should be a model! You must get undressed for us of the naturalist school. Courtesans among us! Look at how lovely! A real woman, with everything in its place. Now you must turn like this. Slowly. - A delight! - Are you afraid of showing yourself? You'll have to change jobs with the futurists. Otherwise, you know where you'll find a breast? Come here! You want this old man to get a stroke? She was an old friend of mine. Did you find her at Fernanda's? - The photograph? - The girl. - It's not so difficult. - Shut up! Do you still love her? - You can't forget her? - How do you know? I can't, either. I look for Titina. I look, but can't find her. I look for Titina. Who knows where she is! I look for Titina. I look, but can't find her. I look for Titina. Who knows where she is! Here's my Titina! After the move, the saw! I look for Titina. I look, but can't find her. - Come on! - Who knows where she is! Titina, my Titina. I look for Titina. I look, but can't find her. Who knows where she is! Who knows where she is! Duke. Duke! Duke. Pasqualino, are you still awake? - Go sleep. - Good night, Duke. Try again, dear. Youth. Youth. Spring of beauty. Fascism is the salvation of our freedom. Good girl! Again. Spring of beauty. Of our freedom.
