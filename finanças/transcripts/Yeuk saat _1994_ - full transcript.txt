I am afraid Afraid... Afraid... Dirty... Don't, don't... The witness is now in agitated condition The court will resume after an hour of adjournment Court The witness is mentally-retarded It is a special case I permit a social worker to accompany with the witness But, I announce that the social worker's responsibility is to accompany the witness The social worker can't hinder or guide the witness to talk Barrister, go on Judge Jury What the witness said is not smooth But, I think you know this case very much Here, I want to stress a thing The victim is now 21 But, her IQ is only like a 10 year-old kid Mentally, a mentally-retarded is like a kid Very direct and generous, easy to trust people The defendant is the victim's teacher in the shelter workshop He used the victim's weakness to hurt her, rape her So shameless The victim is mentally-retarded She can defeat her mental hindrance! She can be the witness! This spirit worths respect! Judge. Finish Barrister, it's your turn Thank you, Judge Witness! Look at me Objection Talking so loudly, you scare the witness Judge. Talking loudly is my usual practice The witness always lets her head down The jury can't see her eyes I can't see her talking about real things or unreal things It's unfair to my client Witness. Head up, please Miss Kong Yuk Ming Have you had sexual intercourse? Objection! Miss Kong Yuk Ming Do you like to be with the defendant and play with him? When you are with him, do you like to grab his arm? Do you like to let your breasts touch his arm? Objection! The witness doesn't know A girl shouldn't let the other people touch her breasts Know or not is another matter The most important is "need or not need" Before what had happened, you grabbed the witness's arm His arm touched your breasts When you held his waist, did you feel "happy"? Objection! The witness must answer From this we can see that In fact, the witness needs much sex Is that correct? Order Order I warn you all Being noisy in the court, you will be charged with disrespect the court! I hope you all pay attention to this Barrister, go on Thank you, Judge What I've just said is not nonsense All are facts Having evidence I want to summon a witness Kong Yuk Ming, do you know this man? Damn Fat Pig Fat Pig... Right. He's called Yeung Bo His nickname is Fat Pig His duty is to move things from the store to the shelter workshop Witness, do you know him? Do you really know him? Just two weeks before this case, the defendant saw Yeung Bo with the witness They were in the godown of the workshop Were they? Yes Did you think that the witness would show you her breasts? Yes, her balls... OK. You can go now Thank you, Judge In fact, the mentally-retarded have strong needs in sex At that night, in fact, you seduced the defendant You went into his room and seduced him Then, you made love with him So exciting Your clothes are torn Were you satisfied? Objection! Did you have orgasm? No. The witness needn't answer it You had! Perhaps it was your first time Thus, you reacted greatly You kicked down the table You enjoyed your first time, but you don't want people know Thus, you said he had raped you! Didn't you? In fact, you love the defendant so much You love him so much, want to make love with him Do you? You seduced him You've planned to seduce him to make love with you Correct? You have strong sexual needs Do you? You say! Court I've considered it The following is my decision: The victim is now in bad condition When ordering her to talk about what had happened, to her, it was painful experience So, I think the victim is unsuitable for telling us Now, I announce to end this case Release the defendant now What's happened? Those bastards... Order! What decision it is? Order!
