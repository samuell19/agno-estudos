It's been a long time, 20 years. There it is. Oh, but it's not like him, Nick. It's not his style at all. No, he'd have fancied something more like Grant's tomb. He had size. A big dream, a big drive. I liked him for what he might have been. It's strange to be standing here again. He seems like someone we knew in another time. Another life, another world. Jazz, Prohibition, flaming youth. Well, that's odd. That inscription. Chapter and verse, nothing else. Did you arrange for it like that? There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death. 1928. Remember the Lindy hop? Before that, the black bottom, and before that, the Charleston. Wild, careless dances beating out the crazy rhythms of the jazz mad '20s. Jazz, throbbing like the pulse of the country. Prosperity, paper prophets, fortunes made overnight. Yes, the ghost signals were up. All the lights were green, and young America went joy riding on homemade hooch. Prohibition brought with it new ways to get one's hands on the big money. The speak-easy. The gunman. The bootlegger. Rum runners. Hijackers. The gang wars. And out of the '20s and all they were, came Jay Gatsby, who built a dark empire for himself, because he carried a dream in his heart. A dream he brought with him that day in the spring of 1928 when he drove out to Long Island with his henchmen to look at a house. Lupus, how far is it to West Egg? I don't know. Hey. West Egg. It's five miles straight ahead. Past through this dump section, it gets pretty further on. Never mind the windshield. How much do I owe you? Two-forty. I don't know if I can change a 20, Mister. I'll see. How about that real estate agent, Lupus? You be at the place with Kinsella. Two hundred grand. That's a lot of money. It's my money, Lupus. Are you sure you want it, Jay? I want it, old sport. Hey, Lupus. Did you notice that thing? What's a matter with you? Them eyes. They get ya. Sees it all, knows it all, eh? Yeah. Like God bought himself a pair of eyeglasses so he could watch us better. They follow ya. It's painted that way. It's what they call an optical illusion. I don't like this place. Nothing but ashes and junk and ashes. Well, you're all dressed up again. I need a couple of dollars. I thought you said your sister was working. She's off this afternoon. She was off the day before yesterday. Mm-mm. And the day before that. What kind of a job has she got, anyway? Look, do we have to go through this every time I wanna run into town and see my sister? No, but when will you be back? Tonight? I don't know. I might stay over. Will you hurry, please? You'll have to gimme something smaller, Mister. I'm sorry. -Keep the change. -$20? Yeah, I'm in a hurry. Hey, Mister, how's chances of getting a lift as far as the railroad station? Sorry. It's right on your way. It wouldn't be no trouble. Thanks, Mister. Thanks very much. -Myrtle. -You're a big help. Myrtle, honey. The plumbing's a bit old fashioned, but that's a small matter. Now this, of course, was always used as the ballroom. Boy, look at that piano. Yes, we just had that uncovered. Well, Mr. Gatsby? Well, I wanted something on the other side of the channel, in West Egg. Impossible. There isn't anybody can buy in there. That's the most exclusive stretch of property on Long Island Sound. But if you'll just take a look at this map. Will you hold that end, please? Now as you can see, you're directly across the channel from West Egg. Here at East Egg. Here's you and here's the Buchanan Show place. It's right over there. At night, you can see the green light on their dock. It blinks. This Tom Buchanan was a Yale college footballer a while back. Now he has the best looking stable of polo ponies and wife on the north shore. Yes, I know. And when you refer to polo ponies, it's string not stable. String. This little shack behind you is rented by Mrs. Buchanan's second cousin, another Yale college man, name of Nick Carraway. Stocks and bonds, but strictly small time. I know. It's an eye sore. You could pick it up cheap, bounce this Carraway guy and tear it down. If he squawks, throw a little business his way. These people are high class around here. They don't like to be bounced around. -All right, it's a deal. -Well, good. I want the decorator that did Buchanan's place. New furnishings from top to bottom. Turn 'em loose. Oh, I want statues out on the terrace. Fine statues. The best that money can buy. All these horrible chandeliers. Get rid of them. I want crystal in this room. Want murals on the walls. All over the walls. Big murals. Antiques. Lots of antiques. New carpets all over the house. How much you figure spending on this? As much as it costs. It's 8:30. When are we gonna get outta here? New plumbing. Check. Add a couple of rooms to the servants quarters. Check. What about that crummy panelling in the drawing room? Get tapestries. Check. Look, these alterations, they take time. When you plan on moving in? Next month. -Next month? -Check. Check. Just a cottage, small by a waterfall. I don't get it. A fortune, a king size fortune. And for what? Well, I better get started tonight. When he says one month, he means 30 days. Personally, I'm a very simple man. This kind of house, it's not for me. Of course, Jay is a different type of person. He likes everything big. Why he should take such a shellacking to get this particular white elephant, it's beyond me. Maybe you can figure it. Sure, I figure it.

Gonna take him home, I've got a million of 'em. Ask him if he wants a drink of champagne. Did I just see a horse? I wouldn't be surprised. I work here. Would you tell Mr. Gatsby that Mr. Carraway, Mr. Nicholas Carraway, is here? I will, sir. If I can find him. Thank you. -Hi. -Hi. Anybody here seen Gatsby? -Who? -Our host. Oh, is that his name? Well, he must be around here some place, I guess. Come on, baby. Do that hula hula again. Okay. Excuse me, sir. The operator is still trying to get Montreal, and a call has just come through from Kansas City, and a Mr. Nicholas Carraway is here. He has just arrived. -Alone? -I believe so, sir. -You sure no one's with him? - I didn't see anyone. Never mind Kansas City, and don't accept any more calls tonight. Now where's Mr. Carraway? I wonder if you can help me. Nobody else seems up to it. I'm looking for Gatsby. Good heavens. Why? I'd like to thank him for the invitation. Young man, no one gets invited to Gatsby's they just come. Sorry, but early this morning, a chauffeur in a uniform of robin's egg blue crossed my lawn, bearing a gilt-edged invitation signed Jay Gatsby in a round, majestic hand. Amazing. I've never met anybody invited. -Cheers. -Cheers. Enjoying yourself, old sport? Yes and no. Beautiful evening, lovely girls. Good music. But what's it all for? I gather you don't like parties. That depends. I'll tell you the truth. I'm not too keen about them myself. This Gatsby must be quite a character. What makes you think so? Well, I'm his neighbour and I've listened to these goings on for two weeks, wondering what it is that makes a man live like this. Thought I'd come and see for myself. Think you'll find out? I don't know. Gatsby probably doesn't know himself. I think he does. You see, I'm Gatsby. Oh. Let me go. I said let go. How are you, Gats? I'm afraid I don't know you. And my name is Gatsby. Yeah, and my name ain't Reba. There must be some mistake. Who did Mr. Reba come with? I came by myself. You know what for, Gats. You shouldn't drink if you can't handle it, Mr. Reba. Never mind a brush off, Gats. You know what I want. Excuse me, please. Get him out of here. Some drunk. The server's a little careless at times. Yes. I'm sorry I, I didn't know you, Mr. Gatsby. Oh, please don't mention it. Please don't. I'm delighted and honoured that you could come. I have a new speed boat down on my dock. Would you care to see it? Yes. Thank you. It's right over here. She's a beauty, all right. She'll move 60 without even trying. Not tonight. There's too many guests. Bet she handles like a charm. She's a cinch in her class. -Is she entered? -Entered? In the race next week. Oh, no, I, I don't use it for racing purposes. Just for my own personal use. Too bad. Sits comfortably. Mr. Carraway, now that we've met, what is your opinion of me? I don't want you to get any wrong ideas from these stories. I'd like to ask a favour of you. But first I think you should know something about me. -A favour? -Yes, I'll come to that later. Right now I'd like to tell you the whole truth. You see, I was the son of a very wealthy family in the Middle West. I was brought up in the United States, educated at Oxford. Family tradition, you know. I hear it's a good school. When my parents died, I came into a lot of money. After that, I began to live like a young Raja, collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game. When the war came along, I joined up. I was promoted to a Major in the Argonne Force. Every Allied government gave me a decoration. What outfit were you in? 165th Infantry, Rainbow Division. And this is one of the. For valour extraordinary. What part of the Middle West did you come from? Minneapolis. That's very interesting. I was born there. What street did you live on? You're smart, Mr. Carraway. And you're a real gentleman. If I had a man like you for a friend, I'd figure I'd come a long way. Thank you. I'm a self-made man. I've done pretty well, even if I say so myself. You wouldn't believe it, but 14 years ago, I was just a dumb kid on the shores of Lake Superior, scratching around docks for a living, catching sails, caulking boats, and wearing the only clothes I owned. One day while I was mending a net, I looked up and there was this yacht lying right over Little Gull Reef. If a squall came up, she'd break her back on it in half an hour. I tried to hail them, but no answer. So I got out there as quick as I could and warn them. I rode my boat out to the yacht and yelled at the sailors to tell the skipper. And I guess he hadn't taken a very good look at his chart of the Great Lakes. While they were getting it through their heads, old Dan Cody stuck his head over the side. I found out later he'd dug up $48 million outta the Yukon. Well, come aboard. Pull him up. Bring him up here. I'm getting rid of you two. Banking me on a reef. I'll have that captain's scalp for this. Come aboard, son. You know, you've just saved me $150,000. I like you. Have a drink. No thanks. I don't drink. No? Well, have a chair anyway. -What's your name? -Jimmy Gats. Where do you live? Over on the shore there. Parents? What do you do for a living? Oh, I fish. Fish. You like that? Sure. That's your aim in life, eh? Sit down, sit down, sit down. What do you want most? What's your big dream? Something like this. How? Peddling fish at a nickel a throw. I know I'll have to persevere. Work hard. Control my instincts. Oh, my boy. You've fallen for the old razzle dazzle. All that stuff is just to keep the suckers quiet while the wise people rake the chips in. There are special rules for smart people. And if a smart man sees something he wants, he just stakes his claim to it. And if somebody else is in ahead of him, well, he just moves in anyway. But whatever your dream is, son, your first step is to get some money in the bank. Whatever you want, anything in the world. If you got money, you just take it. You're gonna be moving on, sir. I better go ashore. -Dan. -Oh, this is my wife Ella. Ella, this is Jimmy Gats. How do you do? She's just waiting for me to kick off, but I'm too tough for her. Dan. Hey, why don't you sign on with me, son? We're going around the world. I'll show you all the kingdoms of earth and the glory thereof. I'll learn you life on the inside. I'll educate you how to hit the jackpot every time. I'll tell... Ah... Go right ahead, Jimmy. Go right ahead. You got everything I haven't got. Youth, health, strength. Why don't you try to take her away from me? Dan, stop it. I don't think you can. "Cause I got the bank roll and that's what counts. Nothing else matters. Nothing. Yeah, you come along with me, Jimmy. Find out for yourself. I'll give you a sense of real practical values. When old Dan's yacht sailed that day, I was on it. As a deckhand. For a kid who never had very much out of life, even being a deckhand on a yacht like that's a luxury. And old Dan was as good as his word and showed me the world as we sailed the seven seas, through calm and storm. But all the time I was brooding about Ella, and I knew she was thinking about me. About a year later, we were lying off an island near Samoa. The old man had promoted me a couple of times. My job was easier now, and I guess I was feeling just like a big shot. They had just come back from a party ashore when I saw her standing down the rail alone and remembered what old Dan had said. Keep right on trying, sonny. Twice more we sailed around the globe, and no matter where we'd be, the old man kept devilling me about her. But he was good to me too. And as he grew older and weaker, he relied on me more and more. For the last few months of the voyage, I was almost like a son to him. The end came one night while we were anchored in the harbour at Rio. I'd better go shore and bring the doctor back. Ah, don't waste your time. Jimmy... Jimmy, I've left you a little cash. Not much. I don't want to spoil you. But you were all right. You've been around the world three times. You've seen a lot of places. We met a lot of people. Now, Dan was always right, huh? It's money in the bank that talks every time, everywhere, money. Dan, don't try to talk. Rest. You never could lay a finger on her. Could you, Jimmy, huh? Old Dan's a devil. But old Dan's always right. You, Jimmy, you're, you're a good boy. Now go away. Leave us alone. Sure. Ella. He's dead. Jim. What's the matter with you? This is what I've been waiting for. And don't forget, sailor. I'm at the wheel now. He left you 25,000, but I can fight that so you'd never get a penny. Oh, Jim. That was 12 years ago. Ella's dead now. Drank herself to death. When the old man was alive, I didn't have a chance. Should have taught me old Dan was right. But I was still a sucker. One more time I was a sucker, then I got wised up, and things were different. I got along a lot better. Now I'm acquainted with fine people. That's my pleasure, having high class people at my parties. You are related to the Buchanans, aren't you, Mr. Carraway? Yes. She's my second cousin. -That's her place over there. -Yes, I know. I often watch their beacon from my dock here. I, I wonder if you could drop by with them some evening. Is that the favour? Yes, it is. Well, I don't see an awful lot of them, and they're not much for parties. They might turn me down. Well, then maybe, maybe you could ask Mrs. Buchanan to tea someday and have me over. But don't tell her in advance I'll be there. Why shouldn't I tell her? Well, I'm not at liberty to divulge that just yet. You don't make much money, do you, old sport? I'm in the stock market pretty heavy these days. Maybe I can throw some business your way. Every man has his price, Mr. Carraway. What's yours? Let's go back to your party, Mr. Gatsby. -You look fine, Tom. -Me, I could play two 30 minute halves right now before dinner. -Here he is. -Hello, Daisy. Nick, darling. I think you know that beautiful something over there. Hello, Jordan. Oh, I'm absolutely paralysed with happiness to see you again, Mr. Carraway. Is he still poor? -Alas. -Alas. Nick, it's ages since we've seen you. What are you doing with yourself? Wall Street. Oh, a regular gravy train these days. I'm glad you're on it. -Ouch. -What's the matter? -Tough going? -Remorse. Selling bonds to old college chums for Auld Lang Syne. Not exactly a job for an able-bodied man. You're crazy. You're much better off what you're doing than... say, what was it you wanted to be at college? A writer. He used to write the most exquisite poems. Pash as anything. Ah, yes. Those were the days. Sure were. Never forget that Princeton game when you knocked Cooley Stack cold on the one yard line. -Tom's big moment. -Uh-huh. You know, everything since then has been kind of- -Anti-climactic? -Yeah. He hit him so hard, Cooley was sick on the sidelines. Yep, those were the days. Let's all be sick on the sidelines. -Jordan. -No thanks. -Oh, she's in training for the other leg. -Leg? The last one. She's got two already. The Wessex trophy, silly. Oh, God. That's right. You win all the time, don't you, Jordan? I've been reading about you in the papers. Have you? That caddy should have been horse whipped, claiming that Jordan wanted him to change a lie, in the National Women's amateur too. Why, that's cheating. Jordan wouldn't- Um, uh, Nick, uh, what I mean is what do you do? Well, I've got a little house across the channel. Read quite a bit. When the racket from my neighbour's parties lets me. Chap named Gatsby. What Gatsby is that? Mr. Buchanan, there's a call for you. Oh, I'll take it in the library. Oh, why not here? Business. You'd be bored. Uh, in two more days, it'll be the longest day of the year. Do you always wait for it to be the longest day of the year and then miss it when it comes? Oh, Nick, I'm so glad to see you. You are my own flesh and blood, you know? Excuse me a moment. -What? -Shh, shh. Tom, it's that woman. I know it. Who are you talking about? What in the world are you... One of the secretaries in my office- - Jordan. - Was talking about a meeting. - Don't lie. - I want to hear. - I'm not going to put up with it. - They're having a quarrel. They're always quarrelling lately. You make a practise of eaves dropping? Always. It's one of the most satisfying things in life. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Oh, I like your scowl. If you were only half as rich as Tom, I think I could fall in love with you. I could fall in love with you just as I am. -Why, Mr. Carraway. -Jordan. All right, have it your way. Ah, romance. Well, it's about time. The years I've spent trying to throw you two together, accidentally locking you up in a closet, pushing you out to sea in a row-boat. Nick, would you like to see my baby? Of course, she's not really a baby anymore. -How old is she? -She's almost four. But she was four last month. -Well, that's almost four. -I'll bring her downstairs. Nick, that Gatsby you mentioned. -You know him? -Mm-hm. -He asked me to bring Tom and Daisy over. -Oh? He even suggested I have Daisy to tea alone and ask him without telling her. Did he? Oh, they know each other. They do? She doesn't realise he's the same one. But I saw him at the club the other day. He's even better looking now than he was when we knew him in Louisville where Daisy and I spent our beautiful white girlhood together. All the mad young things used to give teas and dances with the 90 day wonders at Camp Taylor who were going overseas to make the world safe for democracy. Such goings on. Daisy and I used to compare notes, and she told me about this one she'd really fallen for. He was a lieutenant then, and somehow different from all the others. Even in those days, there was something mysterious about him. Daisy's family was the oldest and finest in town, but we never quite knew who Jay was or where he came from. But what a case they had. Tell me about your other girls. I wanna hate them terribly. There aren't. I've never known anyone like you, Daisy. I'll never love anyone else. I think I'm going to cry. Not right here, please? Daisy. I don't feel like crying anymore. I just want to look at you. Oh, Jay, why can't we be married now before you leave? Daisy, you, you don't know much about me. It's love. What if I were poor or something? Suppose I were ugly. You'd still want me, wouldn't you? I don't think so, Daisy. I, I couldn't. I'd hate you if you said you did. I'd despise you. There's nobody for me but you, Daisy. That's why I want you to know something about me. -I do. -No. You see, I haven't a thing in the world except a small legacy. And that's being contested. But I know I can make good. I know you can. Just as I know there's no one else in the world for me either. Well, the family's always after me about marrying right. But I'll die before I'll let 'em do that to me. I'll simply die. Let's get married now, Jay. This week. Oh, please darling. It wouldn't be right, Daisy. You never know what can happen in a war. And besides, I don't want to come to you empty-handed. After I get back, I'll take whatever's coming to me from that legacy, and I'll start a business. With you to work for, there isn't a thing in the world that I can't do. Of course, but I wanna be your wife now. I want to be your husband, but the right way. I wanna make your family proud of me. Yes, but... All right, darling, whatever you say, whatever you want. Trust me, please. -Please, trust me. -Yes, Jay, always. So Jay Gatsby went to war. Daisy was very tragic and gallant about it. They corresponded for about 18 months, and then Tom Buchanan came down to Louisville in a private train with 100 people and a pearl necklace worth $350,000 and married her. Daisy got tight just before the ceremony. First time I'd ever seen her that way. We gave her cold showers and made her go through with it. But I saw her and Tom during the honeymoon and I never knew a girl more in love with her husband. I ought to punch this Mr. Gatsby right in the jaw. -I wouldn't if I were you. -What kind of a man is he, trying to use me to arrange an assignation? Oh, don't be so smug. -That's what it amounts to, doesn't it? -Well, who are we to say they should or shouldn't see each other again? - She's married. - Unhappily married. -Who says so?? -Tom's not exactly an ideal husband. There are whispers. More than whispers. -About what? -Oh, some woman he's chasing. Business. That was she phoning him in there. I don't believe it. He must be out of his mind married to a girl like Daisy and- Sorry, folks, I have to run into town. Special board of directors meeting. -Where's Daisy? -Upstairs. Tell her for me, will you, Jordan? Drop in again, Nick, real soon. We like having you around. Darling, I have to run into town. Yes, I heard. Pammy, say goodnight to daddy now, dear. He won't be here later. We'll ride the new pony tomorrow. You'll like that, won't you, Pammy? Goodnight, darling. Must you run off like this, Tom? I'm sorry, darling. It can't be helped. Goodnight, everybody. See you all soon. Do you like her, Nick? -She's lovely. How are you, Pam? -Fine. You know what I said when she was born? I said, dear heaven, please make her grow up to be a beautiful little fool. That's the best thing a girl can be in this world. A beautiful little fool. You try very, very hard to make people think you are one, don't you, Daisy? Darling. Yeah. Remember, it's my move. Good evening, Mr. Buchanan. Evening, Wilson. I'm having the town car sent over tomorrow for a motor tune-up. How soon can I have it back? Sometime next week. I'm a little short handed and, and I'm sick. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Wish I'd get away some place. Out west maybe. How's Mrs. Wilson? Myrtle? She's fine, I guess. She, she went to the movies. -Well, good night. -Good night. You're a little late, Tom. I'm sorry, Myrtle. Now maybe before a couple hundred moochers drop in, you'll tell me what you want. I don't like my friends being called moochers. Excuse me. Lupus, we're standing still. I don't like that. You got any ideas? Yeah, it's the West Coast. I hear it's a nice place. Sunshine, oranges. They're not organised out there. They're ready for new developments. Ain't you ever gonna be satisfied, Jay? What do you want? The whole country? Yeah. Right in my belly. It's a big country, Jay. You sound tired, Lupus. Must be getting old. Soft. I've had my day. Yeah, well, not me. Mr. Gatsby, a lady is on the phone. She wants- Tell her to come over any Saturday and bring her friends. As many as she wants. Lupus, I think we ought to send a couple of men out to the West Coast to look it over. Excuse me, sir. The lady wants to know if you'd care to meet her this morning at the South Point Country Club. -She said it is urgent. -Yes, who is she? A Ms. Baker. Baker? Ms. Jordan Baker? I believe that's what she said, sir. I'll speak to her. No, tell her I'll meet her at the club. This West Coast deal. You sure you want it? We'll talk about that some other time, Lupus. I'll see you in town. It's just about right. -Shall I rub it up for you? -No, thank you. Don't touch it. I'm superstitious. Hello, Jordan. Hello, Jay. -They said I'd find you out here. -I hope you don't mind. I'm tuning up my magic putter for the Wessex Trophy. One more leg and it's mine. Permanent possession. Go right ahead. After all these years, how did you know I was the same Gatsby, Jordan? I saw you here last week. I was just leaving in my broken down old dinky when you pulled into the driveway in that gorgeous new yellow Roadster of yours. -Oh, you like that, huh? -Need you ask? I wish you'd come to one of my parties. I'd love to. When? -Any Saturday night. -Fine. I, uh, I saw Nick Carraway the other evening. Yes. He mentioned something about a tea you wanted him to give. If you're still interested, I might be able to arrange it. Yes, I am. When? Oh, when it's worth my while. It certainly is an awfully good looking Duesenberg you drive. -You sure you got everything? -Yes, sir. Everything. -Hello. -Hello, Mr. Carraway. Well, what's all this? I hope you don't mind. I had my people bring over a few things. Thought it might help out. - Help out? - For the tea this afternoon. Tea? And thanks so much for the invitation. From me? I don't know what you're talking about. Come on, my butler took a call asking me to come over. Now if you could just tell me where you want these- There's been a misunderstanding. -I didn't leave that message. -No? As a matter of fact, I resented your suggestion. I still resent it and I wouldn't... You're not under the impression that Mrs. Buchanan will be here this afternoon? Naturally, I assumed that. We'll see about that right now. Central. Get me West Egg 268, please. Stay there. -Mrs. Buchanan, please. -Mr. Carraway calling. When do you expect her back? -Oh, thank you. -Well? She's not there. The butler said she was out with Ms. Jordan Baker. Frankly, it was Ms. Baker who extended me your invitation. It was? Gatsby, you've got such colossal nerve, I'm almost tempted. Thank you. Come in, please. -Where's your dining room? -Straight through the liv- Right through there. This means a great deal to me, old sport. I hope you don't mind if my people fix things up a bit. This is insane. There's enough in there for 20 people. The place looks fine now. One of the papers said they thought it would stop raining around five o'clock. I think it was the journal. Five o'clock. Must be fast. No, it isn't. Want a drink? No, no thanks. Well, don't let them stay out in the rain. All right. Don't be so jumpy. Oh, I love it like this. The rain, I mean. You won't get wet. Here's a coat. Thank you. Hurry up, slow pokes. Take it easy, Daisy. Those steps are slippery. Has anyone got a row-boat handy? Oh, is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one? I'm so glad you asked Jordan to bring me along. Will there be tea with crumpets and candles? Oh, I'll pour. Jordan, would you mind telling me what this is all about? Not now. Please. Oh, I like this house. -Are we the first? -No. Where's- - What? - Nothing. Oh, I love being places first. Everything always looks so nice. Tom and I never get any place first anymore. Or is it all for us, darling? I know you are secretly in love with me. Oh, what beautiful roses. You raise flowers, Jordan? Flowers? Of course I do, darling. I raise a little of everything. You know, a day like today always reminds me of my Aunt Laticia, the one who raised dahlias. I always call her my rainy day aunt, because she always came to visit mama... On rainy days. Jay. Daisy. I'm awfully glad to see you again, Jay. We've met before, Nick. But not for a long time. Eleven years. In Louisville. During the war. Nick, would you mind running a few errands with me? Yes, I would. Even for a ride in my brand new Roadster? We just got it this morning. I wonder why. Then see me to the door. You're acting like a awful stuffed shirt. Bless you, my children. I'd like to take you over my knee. Oh, you darling. Anytime, any place. You're so refreshing in this generation of good time Charlies. That's why I'm fond of you. You're fond of Jordan Baker and Roadsters. Isn't it a dream? It's exactly like Gatsby's, isn't it? And so it is. No umbrella this crossing? All right, but I'm staying here. It's letting up a little. Come on. -Cigarette? -Thanks. I don't smoke much anymore. Only when I'm hungry or something. I, I don't know why. I used to smoke all the time when it was, you know, daring. I don't remember your smoking excessively. They say people smoke and they eat too much and things like that because they're bored. I think it's more that they're frustrated. But that's silly, isn't it? Because that's why they're bored. I guess that's one way to look at it. Depends on the person, I suppose. Tom smokes like a chimney and I don't believe he's ever been bored in his life. Tom's my husband. I understand he's quite a polo player. Eight goals, but it's more that he... Are you married too? No. Did you know I'd be here this afternoon? -Yes, I did. -How? I asked Jordan to bring you over. You asked? You wanted to see me again? - More than- - Please don't say anything. Don't do anything and don't be offended. I'm looking for someone, a boy in a uniform. -Jay. -Yes, Daisy. I just wanted to make sure it was you. When you first came in, I couldn't believe it, and it wasn't you, but it is now. I'm not making sense, am I? -Daisy. -Oh, please just sit there. Would, uh, anybody care for some tea? No, thanks. It stopped raining. I wonder if there'll be a rainbow. That's my house over there. That huge place? Do you like it? I love it. Do you live there all alone? I always try to keep it full of celebrated people. Would you like to see it? Now. Right away. I don't know, but I think this is the most wonderful day of my life. Nick, we're going to Jay's house. You mind if I wash my face? -Straight down the hall. -I'll find it. This entrance hall is in the Georgian style of architecture. Why, why, it's horribly beautiful, Jay. Yes. Very impressive. I'd hoped you'd like it. I'd like to show Mrs. Buchanan around. You don't mind, do you? Oh, no, no. Not at all. Klipspringer? Right here. All ready, boss. - Play something. - Play what? Anything. Just play. The big library's upstairs here. - Hello. - Hello. "Play something," he says. And I've been waiting here two hours. You're Mr. Carraway, aren't you? That's right. Glad to know you. Any friend of the Major's is a friend of mine. Thank you. Oh, it's wonderful to see you like this, Jay. All successful and everything. It's wonderful to see you, Daisy. Here in my own home. That's all it needs to make it perfect, the way I've always imagined it. In here is my gallery. All genuine old masterpieces. Big day for the Major. He's waited for it. How do you mean? It's on her account. All of this. You've known him a long time, haven't you? I served under him. I was in what was left of the machine gun battalion he took so far forward, there was a gap a half a mile on either side of us where the infantry couldn't advance. We stayed there two days and two nights. One hundred and thirty men with 16 Lewis guns. That's when they made him a Major. We got back to New York in November 1919. I picked up a railroad ticket for him to Louisville. He was walking on clouds when I left him. But when I got back to the hotel room... Here you are, Major, a one way to Louisville on the 12:20. Well, back, Major. Here's the ticket. -Tear it up. -Huh? I'm not going. Buchanan and Fay rites. -Who's the guy? -Can't you read? While at Yale, Mr. Buchanan was selected on several all-American football teams. He's the grandson of Rubus Buchanan, famed Chicago industrialist whose fortune reputedly exceeds $30 million. Money. Well, the old devil was right. You can't win without it. You lose every time. Twice now I've had it proven to me. First time it didn't hit me like this though. Sure, I wanted Ella, but I didn't love her. But Daisy. She was all I wanted in this world. You better forget her, Major. You can't compete in that league. But she loves me. I know she does. I don't blame her for what she's done. Who am I? Just a dumb nobody that hasn't got enough money to get outta this uniform. Oh, Major. Major, there's a speak-easy around the corner. Maybe if you had a little drink, you'd feel better. Oh, no. You just can't lay there. Will you leave me alone, please? I'm sorry, Major. I, I just thought maybe we... Who is it? Telegram for Major Gatsby. Slip it under the door. Here you are, Major. Don't you wanna read it? Oh, you read it. Major J. Gatsby, Beldon Hotel, New York City. Reply your inquiry. Your $25,000 claim against the Dan Cody estate has been settled for $5,000. Please contact us to arrange payment. Must pay while- Thanks, Skipper. I'm your boy. I'm gonna make this grow. Where's that speak-easy? What are we waiting for? Well, that was the beginning. We met a man named Lupus in that speak-easy. He was down on his luck. Looking for a fellow like the Major with a little cash. They went into business together, and now he lives in a house like this. And this is my room. How sweet. It's the plainest of all. I don't care about luxury things just for myself. What's behind all the doors? Oh, that's where I keep my clothes. I get all my suits from Bond Street. How beautiful. Here are my shirts. So many. Oh, here's some more. Yes, Jay. I have a man in England who sends me a selection every season, spring and fall. He's the same man who buys for the Prince of Wales. Has some wonderful materials. Flannels, linens, silks. They come all monogrammed. -You like them? -Oh, Jay, they're such beautiful shirts. They make me think how nice you used to look in your lieutenant's uniform. How did you ever forgive me? Did it take a long time? Time? It, it was my fault. I shouldn't have expected you to wait. I was nobody then. I had nothing at all. When I came back from France and I heard about it, I swore that nothing would stop me. I'd raise myself to deserve you and win you back. But you mustn't think I'm different from other people, Jay. I'm no better. Really, I'm not. You're still the best, Daisy. That's what counts with me. What's the matter? Oh, Jay. You have tried so hard. You never forgot me either, did you, Daisy? You wouldn't be this way if you had. All these years, you've really never changed. In your heart, you still cared for me, didn't you? Always. Let's, let's start over. Right now. Be my girl again. The way it should have been. You want that too, don't you? Yes. Why should we be apart any longer? Tell your husband, Daisy. Tell him you're coming to me. Tell him soon. Yes, Jay. - I will. -Soon. -Mr. Gatsby. -Yes? Mr. and Mrs. Buchanan have arrived. Certainly. Where are they? Right over there. What kind of a circus is this? Now, Tom, you know I adore large parties. They're so intimate. At small parties, there's never any privacy. -Hello. -Hello, Jay. Welcome to Gatsby's. This is my husband. This is Mr. Gatsby. How do you do? How are you? Isn't this the old Hinckler place? He owned a brewery, Daisy. He killed himself when Prohibition came in. Yes, I believe he did. May I get you some champagne? No, thanks. Evening is still young. Later on, we're having some twins from the stage and Frederico from the Met. I believe if you'll look around, you'll see many faces you've heard about. I don't see anyone I know. Tom and I don't get around much. But tonight, Mr. Buchanan is our celebrity. I like the little man with a sort of mole nose. Oh, he's only a small producer. I like him anyway. Do you mind if I look at all these famous people in oblivion. Oh, Tom, don't be such a difficult. Hulking. I hate that word hulking, Daisy. Even in kidding. -Oh, hello, Nick. -Hello, Tom. What are you doing here? Just an innocent bystander. -Dance me, Jay? -With pleasure. We have a very special orchestra tonight. -Excuse us, please. -Sure. Where did Daisy meet that egg? Who is he, anyway? She's been after me for a week to come over here. Hey. Not bad, huh? Who's that? Come on, Nick. -Tom. -Yeah. What's this about you and some woman? Where'd you hear that? -Never mind. -From Daisy? No. Well, it's just that I get a lot more restless these days. Don't worry about me, Nick. Go get yourself a drink. It's just for the laughs, you know. I'll, uh, see you later. -Hello. -Hello. -Hello. -I'm Tom Buchanan. Oh, hello. Did you tell him? I, I don't really want to dance, Jay. Let's go inside. It's chilly. -Hello. -Hello, Jordan. Somehow I didn't expect to find you here. -Would you like a drink? -No thanks. Let's walk. Why haven't you called me? Why should I? Because you're in love with me. Really? You don't have to approve of someone to be in love with them. Interesting. I suppose it's all the bad things about me. What bad things? Oh, that newspaper article for one. What the caddy said about my asking him to change my lie. I did, you know. -Why? -I thought I could get away with it. You think you'd get away with that Roadster too? Well, why not? Nowadays, everybody gets away with things. Look around. There's Rita Ellis. That's her best friend's fiance with her. There's E.P. Bailey, the patent medicine king. The man with him is Culley Benson, Florida real estate, now underwater. Nick, would you like to kiss me? No? Well, I really don't blame you. I'm a pretty sad lot, but so's the world I'm in. It's all out of joint. Crazy, wild, careless. There's nothing to live for or believe in except yourself. Oh, I'm lost, Nick. We all are. You do care for me a little. I don't know why. I don't like myself for it, but I do. Jay, isn't there some place we can be alone in this great big house? Of course there is. Right in here. Come on. I haven't told him yet, Jay. That's not being fair to him. There hasn't been a chance. Besides, how would I put it? Well, tell him the truth. Just say I, I've never loved you. I, I never loved Tom. But, Jay, it's so hard. Oh. Solid. Completely unintentional. -What are you doing up there? -Shakespeare. Listen. "Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang." -Exquisite, isn't it? -Never mind that. Would you be a good chap and leave, please? Delighted to oblige you, old man. But it can't be managed. I got up here all right. But I don't seem able to, to get down. Here, let me give you a hand. Later. Go right ahead. I won't say a word. Get off that ladder. Sir? I shall report you to the host. I am the host. My humble apologies, Mr. Gatsby. But let me assure you that I had no idea. No offence. We'll talk about it later. Right now I have an engagement. I understand, sir. You have impeccable taste in books and in ahh- -Thank you. -Thank you very much. -We'll discuss it some other time. -Delighted. Fancy meeting you here. You don't suppose he'll talk. Well, they'll all have to find out sooner or later, Daisy. Oh, Jay, I'm so terribly confused. I don't know about anything except that I've been unhappy. I'm frightfully clever sometimes, but I'm not very intelligent. Daisy, I wanna start over right. Don't you? It isn't too late, is it? Too late? For us? Of course not. Come on, girls. Let's get out of this traffic jam. Sorry, no trespassing. Not in the library. L'amour. -Oh. -Ain't nature grand? Oh, let's sit over here and give him a break. I wish somebody would give me a break. Say, how about, uh, meeting me tomorrow at The Eggston? I'll go there and wait for you. You'll tell him, Daisy. Yes, I will. I promise. When? Tomorrow. Come for me tomorrow. Tomorrow. But I wanna go home now, Jay. Please don't mind. All in the same hotel. -Tom. -Well, hello. I'd like to go home, Tom. Um, sure. Anything wrong? No, I just want to go home. I'll see you to your car. That won't be necessary. -Look, Mr. Gatsby- -Tom. Goodnight, Jay. Goodnight, Daisy. Goodnight. Mr. Buchanan. Give it up, before it's late. No. Come in here. I want to talk to you. Look at it this way. Apart from the right or wrong, you're expecting too much. You can't recapture the past. Of course you can. She's leaving her husband. She's telling him tonight. I don't believe it. I'm taking her away tomorrow. Everything's above board fair and square. Come along and see for yourself. She won't go through with it. I know Daisy. Listen, Nick, nothing, nobody can stop us now. This time the setup's right. I've got what it takes. Have you? Hello. What are you doing here? I was invited for a very special occasion. Oh, it's too hot to move. I can move. Watch me. I adore you. You forget there's a lady present. Kiss Nick then. Why, the low, vulgar girl. You seem very happy, Daisy. It's too hot to be happy, but I am very happy. -Daisy. -Yes, Jay? Where's your husband? - Well- - Hello, Mommy. I got dressed before lunch. Precious baby. Come to your mother who loves you. Do you like mother's friends? Do you think they're pretty? Aunt Jordan has a white dress too. You think she's pretty, Jay? Yes, she is. I, I think we're gonna like each other a lot. Where's daddy? Here I am, Pammy. I told you never to bring her in when we were serving anything. Hello, darling. Take her upstairs, please. Come, Pammy. I didn't know we were having company. I invited them. How do you do, Mr. Gatsby? Would you have a drink? No, thanks. I'd like to get out of this heat. Hello, Nick. Would you like a drink? No, no, thanks. Daisy, maybe you and I ought run up to the lodge tomorrow. Let's go somewhere now. Let's drive to town. What for? That's ridiculous. It's 10 degrees hotter there. What about lunch? It's too hot for food. I second your motion, Daisy. What goes on here? Why does everybody want to go to town? I just want to go. Do you mind? It's important to me, and I think you ought to go too. All right, Daisy. I'm perfectly willing. Well, what are we waiting for? Let's start. Let's get our things, Jordan. She obviously hasn't told him yet. No. How could she? Maybe you can't tell a man a thing like that in his own house. Where do you people pick up these circus wagons? -Which is which? -Well, that one's mine. You can drive, but we'll have to stop for gas. -Let's go, Daisy. -I'll go with Jay if you let me drive. All right. Get in, you two. Where should we meet? At the Waldorf. First one there hire the bridal suite. You both think I'm pretty dumb, don't you? Well, I made a small investigation about that egg this morning. And you found out he was an Oxford man. Oxford. Probably went to reform school. Say, don't you feel good or what? I'm all run down. Sick all day. There they go. Yeah. Mr. Buchanan, can I talk to you in private for a minute? All right. Well, what is it? I'm in a hurry. You've been a good customer, Mr. Buchanan. I hate to ask you this, but can you lend me some money? My wife and I want to go out west. She does, eh? -She'll go whether she wants to or not. -Well, I- I can't give you very much security, Mr. Buchanan. You see, this place... Here. It's all down here on the paper. Well, uh, I'll think about it. How much for the gas? $2 even. I just got wised up. Something funny going on around here. Here we are. Remind me about this other matter tomorrow, hey? Tom. Lock me up, will you? Oh, it's stifling. Open another window. But there are no more, Madam. Get an axe and we'll chop one. An axe? Yes, madam. You'll make the heat 10 times worse by crabbing about it, Daisy. Why don't you leave her alone, old sport? It's a great expression of yours, isn't it? What is? That old sport business. Where'd you pick it up? Tom, if you are going to make personal remarks... Let's all take a cold shower. So you're an Oxford man. He went there. I looked it up. I'd like to know when. Don't bother to answer him, Jay. There was an opportunity they gave some officers after the armistice. -I was only there five months. -You see? There's one more question I'd like to ask your Mr. Gatsby. What kind of trouble are you trying to cause in my home, anyhow? -Tom, I- -I'd like to have old sport here tell me. Your wife doesn't love you. She never has. She's loved me since 11 years ago. I didn't know Daisy 11 years ago, but I don't know how you got within a mile of her, unless you deliver the groceries to the back door. Daisy loved me when she married me and she loves me now. Tell him, Daisy. Tell him you've never loved him. I... I never loved him. Not in Honolulu? Not in Capri, Taos or Rio? Not even the night I carried you down from the punch bowl to keep your toes dry? Jay, you're asking too much. I love you. Now isn't that enough? Even that's a lie. Why, there are things between Daisy and me that... Look, honey, from now on, I'm gonna take much better care of you. You are through taking care of her. - How come? - Because I'm leaving you. For a common crook who'd have to steal the ring to put on your finger. Here. Seven years ago, he was running beer in trucks, six years ago with a 12 mile limit on the rum barges. Then he started on a big scale with his partner, Myron Lupus. Peddling grain alcohol to shady drug stores all over the country. Yes, it's my business. And it's my merchandise you serve on your table. I've always seen to it you got good stuff. So what does that make you? My bootlegger? What does it make us when we buy the stuff? Shut up, Nick. Daisy, you know yourself it's socially out of the question. Now come on home. Get outta my way, Gatsby, or I'll break your neck. I wouldn't do that if I were you. I'm pretty good with or without gloves. I think you'll find that in your little book, old sport. Don't call me old sport. Let's go, Jay, please. Please, Jay. Wait a minute. I'm protecting my home here. If you go with him, there isn't a court in the country who would award the child to you. That's all I need. Really, it is. That's the final thing. And now you can do what you want and say what you want and try to take my baby away if you think you can. But I'm leaving you and nothing in the world can force me back. Take me to the house, Jay. I'll pack my things. Anybody want a drink? I know Daisy. I know her from top to toe. She really isn't going to do a thing. Not a thing. Let me out of here! Let me out of here! Well, I broke out. See? Get outta my way. Myrtle, put it down. Where do you come off locking me up? Myrtle, baby. I'll get the money tomorrow. We'll go away, just the two of us. Take your hands away. Don't ya lay a finger on me. I'll report you. That's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna turn you over to the police. Myrtle, listen. I don't care what happened. We'll start over again. I'm through with you. And this, this garbage dump. I tell you, we're going away from here. Not with me, ya ain't. I'm never going, ever. The yellow car. That's him. Stop! Stop! Look out for that girl. -Why did you let me drive? -Daisy. Why did you let me drive? Daisy. What's all that? Looks like an accident. I'll just see what's happened. It happened right out there in the road. What do you mean? Is she dead? I think so. The car that hit her was travelling east at a high rate of speed. That's all I could get so far. No, never mind the ambulance. This one is strictly for the basket. Officer. Please, please, folks, nobody else in. -Don't let anybody else in, Bob. -Right. Were you personally a witness? Did you see the accident? I'm not here 'til right when it's over. I run all night diner down the road. This poor feller her husband? Yes, that's her husband. I'm helping carry her in. - My name is Mavromichaelis. - Huh? Mavromichaelis. But you didn't see the car? No. Mr. Wilson. I don't like to disturb you at a time like this, Mr. Wilson. But what kind of a vehicle was it that hit her? You were right there, weren't you? Would you come to my place? Not good to stay here now. No, no. What is it? A woman killed. Hit and run driver. Let's get outta here. We'll stop at the club for a drink. Look, Mr. Wilson, as soon as you tell us something about that car, the quicker we'll catch the guy. Now try to help us. Were there any identifying features? You know, licence number, make, colour? The sun was in my eyes. I didn't see the driver. Well, the car was... Yeah, what about the car? I didn't see nothing. Nothing at all. Mr. Wilson. Mr. Wilson. Mr. Wilson. Daisy, please. I'll go to prison. I couldn't bear it, Jay. -Oh, please, Daisy. -I couldn't. -I'd die. -Don't. I'd die. I'd die! Daisy, stop it. Stop it. I'm sorry, Daisy. I, I had to do it. Oh, Jay, what am I going to do? Nothing, darling. I'll say I was driving. -You? -It's best that way. Remember that, Daisy. I was driving. -No. -Say it, Daisy. Jay was driving. Jay was driving. Jay was... I can't. I can't. Even If anybody saw you, we'll deny it. It's our story against theirs and I'll stick to ours. I swear it. Oh, Jay, you're so good. I love you for that. But I can't let you. We'll talk about it when you're calm. Right now, I've gotta get that car away from here. I'll take it to my place where it belongs. No, Jay, you can't. There's no percent in ditching it. Sooner or later they'll trace it to me. And as much as I hate it, we'll have to postpone things for a while. It'll be safer for you if you stay here for a few days. Must I? It won't be for long, darling. You'll see. We'll come through this and be together just as we planned, won't we? Yes, Jay. Just as we planned. I'll come back here later this evening. I'll be all right. But Tom might do something to upset you. I can manage. I'll be all right. Daisy. You're still the best. Oh, Jay. I'll come back as soon as I can. You didn't eat much, Tom. They ought a get a new chef at the club. The food's awful. Here she is. Daisy. What did I tell you? Daisy, honey. I knew you wouldn't. Don't. What's the matter? Don't worry about this afternoon. We'll let bygones be bygones. We had an accident. -Where? -It was horrible. -Where, Daisy? -Near Wilson's garage. He never even stopped. Please. Now you know what kind of a man he is. He wasn't driving. I was. Oh, Daisy, how awful. You? Nick. That's my lawyer. Get him on the phone and tell him to stand by. We'll get Daisy across the state line so we'll have time to manoeuvre. Hello, operator. Get me West Egg 471. Hurry. It's an emergency. I'll run you up to the lodge, Daisy. Is Mr. Carter there? Well, can you get a message to him? When you can, tell him to call Mr. Buchanan. All right, thank you. He can't be reached 'til tomorrow. You don't need to get a lawyer. It's going to be all right. Al right? It's a prison offence. He's going to say he was driving. - He swore he would. - Gatsby? He drove his car over to his place. What do you know? Trying to act like a gentleman. Well, let him. Are you going to let Gatsby do this? Why not? It's a break, isn't it? You wouldn't want Daisy to go through that, Nick. Say, whose side are you on, anyway? I'm just finding out. Daisy, look. The thing is, he sort of has us over a barrel right now. You'll have to be diplomatic with this egg until the trial is over and he's out of our hair. -Yes, Tom. I'll try. -Good. Play along until we see which way the cat jumps. Yes, Tom, I'll do anything you say. I bet this won't turn out so bad after all. Maybe it'll teach you not to play around. Anything. Just get me out of this. So let me get this straight. Are you actually going to let Gatsby go through with this? And what's the matter with you? Is he a friend of yours or something? -Yes, he is. -Since when? Since one minute ago. If he's such a good friend of yours, I suppose you'll run right to the police and spill the beans. - I should. -But you won't. No, I haven't got the guts. Get out of here, Nick. Good night. Good night. Goodbye, Daisy. Daisy, don't worry about what Nick says. There's nothing else we can do, is there, Tom? No. Come on. We'll get you upstairs. There isn't anything more to be said, Jordan. -Nick. -Yes? Don't forget I'm playing in the finals Wednesday. I'd like you to be there keeping your fingers crossed for me. The finals. You don't need my fingers crossed, Jordan. If you can stand for what's going on in there, you'll get your trophy one way or another. -Goodbye. -Please, Nick. I'm sorry, Jordan. Jay. Jay. Oh. How long have you been out here? Just now. Just this minute. I... I came over to see if everything... Look. Why don't you forget her? -She's not worth it. -Let me alone! Jay. Oh, Jordan, would you go upstairs to Daisy? -She's pretty upset. -All right, Tom. I'll fix myself a night cap. Now, Wilson. What's this mean? You and Myrtle. What are you talking about? You and her. I'm gonna kill you for that. No, it isn't true. It's true. She saw that yellow car coming back. She ran out to talk to who was driving. Why, Mr. Buchanan? How do I know? I... You was driving. I saw you in that car going into town. No, you didn't see me in that car. Not the one she ran out to. It's your car. It's parked outside in your driveway. Which isn't mine. That's Ms. Baker's. And it's not the car that hit her. Did you look at it? Is there a mark on it? There'd have to be after an accident like that, Wilson. Go and take another look at it. Go ahead. You and Myrtle. Wilson, you're making a terrible mistake. I'm not the man. There are lots of yellow cars just like that one outside. You know that. - Yeah? - Yeah. I know of one within just a couple of miles of here. Who's it belong to? I won't tell you that, Wilson. You'll tell. No. I can't. Not in your condition. Where is it? Go ahead and shoot, Wilson. I won't be responsible for a murder. I'll find that other yellow Roadster. I'll find it wherever it is. I'll find him. Number, please? Number, please? Hello? Number, please. Tom. What's the matter, honey? Take me to the police. Please drive me there. I wanna tell 'em the truth. Oh, now, listen, Daisy. What good would that do? Everything's fine the way it is. Let it alone. Tom, help me. Don't let me be a coward. I was frightened last night. Don't let me be weak and selfish this time too. Please, for once in my life, help me to be decent and loyal to do the right thing. Please come with me. No, no, you're just trying to get me mixed up in this. You don't know. Wilson was here last night. -He had a gun. He wanted to kill me. -Wilson? Yes. He thought I was driving the car that hit his wife. -Where did he go? -Looking for it. And you let him go knowing where the car is? - Knowing the- - Yes, I did. That guy had it coming to him. Phone him. Warn him. Warn him! If anything happens to him, I'll never forgive you. I'll hate you as long as I live. Number, please? 348. Hello. Hello, Nick. Your telephone is ringing. I'm sorry, Nick. I lost my head there for a moment last night. You're the one guy in the world- Forget it. I'm one of them. I mean, I was. That car in your driveway. Yeah, what about it? When the chips are down, Nick, that's the way I let 'em ride. And after what you heard last night? -That's right. -But she let you down. She's still Daisy. That phone. Let it ring. I fired all the servants last night. Everybody. I'm through with all this, Nick. I'm through four flushing trying to be something that I'm not, a gentleman. You're a gentleman. A real one. No, I'm not, Nick. I'd hate to tell you all the things that I've been. When I got home here last night, I started thinking. I thought all night long. Nick, I made a mistake somewhere. I thought I was right. I thought old Dan Cody was right. But look what I've done to myself and everybody else to get where I am. And for what? To be like the Buchanans? Operator, operator. This is an emergency. Call the East Egg Police and tell 'em to get over to Gatsby's place right away. Yes. And then keep trying that number. - Let me get that phone. - Forget it. Nick, old Dan said a man was a sucker if he didn't move in and take what he wanted. Well, I was a sucker. For believing him. You're getting your eyes opened, Jay. I'm seeing it clear from here on. I'm gonna pay up, Nick. I'm gonna square myself. I beat a lot of wraps to my time, but I'll take this one. I'll wait right here until the cops find that car. And if they don't find it, I'll call "em. I owe that to a kid named Jimmy Gats. Me, Nick. Me. What's going to happen to kids like Jimmy Gats if guys like me don't tell 'em we're wrong. Maybe after I do my time and start over- Jay. Jay. Nobody came to this party, Jay. Not even Klipspringer. I came. I'm glad. Goodbye, old sport. By the way, where's the trophy? I didn't win it. I didn't want to. Somehow it didn't seem important. Where are you going? Back home to the Middle West. I've got some writing to do. Can I come along? Can I help?
