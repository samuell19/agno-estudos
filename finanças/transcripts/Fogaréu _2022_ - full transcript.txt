Go on, a bit more. It's coming. Push! It's coming. Push, sweetheart. It's coming! No! FOGARÉU - Are you looking for the mayor's house? - Sorry? Are you looking for the mayor's house? Yes, I am. It's here. I'm a Farricoco. Thanks. - Pedro? - Hello. I'm Fernanda, man. Your cousin. Fernanda! Hey! How are you? I'm good. - Long time no see! - For sure. Last time I saw you, you were little. You were... about 8 years old. Something like that. - We went up Corcovado by train. - That's right! You were such a cute little boy. You are looking great! And you have joined the KKK. Who would've imagined? This is just a Farricoco costume. A local tradition. Nothing to do with those guys. I see... - Is everyone in? - Yes. Make yourself at home. - Fernanda? - Aunt Arlette. I can't believe it! - How are you? - Look at you! - You look beautiful, aunt. - Thanks, you too. - Still a hippie, though. - Yup. Dear Lord... We're going to fix that hair. Come on in. Remember you took me to a hairdresser in Rio? Your mom almost killed me because I had your hair straightened. - At your request. - I was only 12. But you looked so cute. That Chanel haircut was so fashionable. You liked it! Yes, I did. It looked good. Why didn't you say you were coming? We'd have sent a driver. Actually, I was in Bolivia... And I decided to come here, on a whim. - Is uncle Antônio in? - He'll be here any moment. Always busy with politics. There he is! Antônio. Look who's here. Uncle Antônio! My dear niece! - Welcome! - This is a hard handshake. So what do you say? Dear uncle, how are you? Go on, what do you say? Your blessing, uncle? God bless you, sweetheart. Hey, everybody. This is Fernanda! My niece and goddaughter. The daughter of my sister Cecília, who passed away. Paula! It's Fernanda, your prodigal cousin. - Paula! - Fernanda! It's been a long time! - Hello. - Hi. Wow! I can see we have news here. Some news! A boy. Thank God. Why? He's going to be a man in a man's world. Right, uncle? Would you like something to drink? Actually, I'd like to take a shower. - Aren't you hungry? - Always. Stay here with us then. There's plenty of tasty food. - Maybe not, then. - No. You're right. If I could, I'd be in my pajamas watching a soap opera. Come with me into the kitchen. - Missy! - Yes, ma'am? Any chops left over from lunch? No, there's none left. Don't worry, I'll eat whatever there is. Make some scrambled eggs, would you? Joana! Look, they're free-range eggs. Fresh from the ranch. Yummy! Hello, how are you? Nice to meet you. I'm Fernanda. You needn't be afraid. They're very kind. They're our adopted children. This is Joana and this is Missy. Missy arrived when I got married. Right, Missy? A present from my mother-in-law. She was her goddaughter. A present from your mother-in-law? No... It's a figure of speech. You know that without us, they'd be in the asylum. That's a fact. Joana! Get those sheets for the maiden room. The flowery sheets for the maiden room. Understand? - Sweetie, I must go back there. - Sure. Missy, you take care of everything. See you in a bit. Cecília! Yes. Did you know my mother? I did. But she wasn't your mother. - She wasn't your mother. - No, of course she wasn't. But you... you're looking like her. If you're cold, there's a blanket in the closet. The bathroom is at the end of the corridor. Aren't there any windows here? No, it's a maiden room. Typical of old houses around here. To keep girls hidden away from men. Or to make sure they didn't elope with them. My mother slept here? As you can see, it didn't stop her from eloping. Certainly not with a man, though. Now that's true! Where does that door lead to? To my bedroom. Parents always keep an eye on their girls. There are never enough eyes to see the evil lurking inside people. - It's in the Bible. - Amen. Good night. Tomorrow you'll talk to your uncle. Now he's a bit... - Busy with politics. - Right. Good night, aunt. Thank you. Good night, sweetie. - Thanks. - Some coffee? We haven't spoken in a long time. Since my mother's death, I think. I should have attended that burial. - But it was election day... - She wasn't buried. I've brought her ashes. I'm going to scatter them here. Well... How weird! Cecília always hated this place. It was this place that hated her. It's not that simple, Fernanda. She used to talk about a ranch she liked. And I think there's also a stream in an indigenous village... The thing is, Paula lives at the ranch. And she's going to have a baby. You're not thinking of scattering her ashes there, are you? It's only ashes. It's not bad luck or anything. Is it really lots of ashes? - What do you mean? - Well... I've never seen that. Around here, we bury the dead. Cousin, think of a packet of some 400 grams of cocaine. Instead of white, it's dark gray. You know Goiás is an international trafficking corridor! No! Not in my administration! With me, it's zero tolerance. So Pedro, are you in college? I'm working on my campaign for the town council. - One more politician in the family! - Sure. Which party? PBP. Same as Dad. Right on! A family fighting for the same ideology is a united family! Fernanda, darling... fancy a drive with your uncle? What did you come here for? I came to scatter my mother's ashes. Is that all? No. I want to see the estate inventory. It's been published. - Now it makes sense. - What then? You showing up out of the blue. No, it's not like that. I came because I felt like it. Don't you trust me? Of course I do. Why? Shouldn't I? Life here hasn't been easy. This ranch is wearing me out. What with the cattle disease and all. We've already lost about 90 animals. I hope they weren't my 90. You're a hard nut to crack, girl! Seriously, though. I want to understand the inventory, her share of the inheritance... In fact, you're not her daughter. Technically speaking. Your grandfather never accepted it. I even had to intervene on your behalf. Please, uncle. Don't give me that. My life started here in this place. My biological parents, whom I never met, came from this place. The mother who raised me, your sister, was also from here. The dyke who brought me up and had to go away because she was a dyke. You think we're barbarians. Your father definitely was. Do you always say all that crap? It's a disease, uncle. - Huntington's disease, ever heard of it? - Never. You say whatever you think or whatever you're thinking when you're talking. You make me dizzy. I'll be quiet. Yeah, what is it? A problem on the indigenous village road. It's urgent! INDIGENOUS TERRITORY AUTHORIZED PEOPLE ONLY Wait here. Don't get out of the car. The mayor said to drive you to town. But what's going on? Were those Xavante Indians? You don't find them in Goiás anymore. - You kicked them all out, didn't you? - Us? Your family did, the Menezes. We're just the grunts, ma'am. You're not from here, you speak differently. Right, I don't speak your language. Is the town still far? - About 5 kilometers. - Stop the car then. - What? - Stop the car, I'll walk. The mayor told me to drive you back. - He doesn't give me orders. - He does me! Paula? Fernanda! - Hey, how are you? - I'm fine, thank you. Hello. Are you here to pray? No, cousin. I like to see how people pray. Joana, we're not donating the baby diapers. I'll get them. - Is it this bag? - Yes, that one. Let's sit down. Sorr', sorr', sorr'... Calm down, it's all right. She's apologizing. She can't say the whole word. But Joana is very smart. And talented, you'd be surprised. She's embroidering the baby's entire layette. - Aren't you, Joana? - Yeah. Paula... These people... who are like Joana... You mean the Fools? - There are lots of them in Goiás. - It's not Goiás. The local asylum is very old. Families from elsewhere would send their disabled children here. They were put up for adoption, the townsfolk adopted them. You understand? Such good people. Yes, people are good here... Sorry. Pick me up at the church. I'll be leaving in a minute. - I'm going to mom's, you want a ride? - I'll stay a little longer. Do you want Joana to stay with you? She's a walking GPS. No, Paula. I'm fine. I'll go for a walk and I'll be home for dinner. Enjoy your walk then. See you later. Let's go, Joana. Can I help you? Did you hear anyone ask for help? I need no help, I can manage on my own. I'll take you. It's all ready, sister. Teresa, go to the bank and come right back. Tadeu is picking you up in an hour. - No hanging around, okay? - Understood. Thanks for your help, sister. Sister, can we have a word? For many years... children were left in the baby hatch and taken to local houses and ranches. If nobody wanted them, the nuns kept them. Were they normal children? Many of them were just poor, but most of them were Fools. Why are there so many Fools here? Some say it's the mines, too much mercury. I don't know. Lots of marriage between relatives. Once, a disabled boy was adopted by his own parents. How come? He was born, the family was ashamed. Left them in the hatch. Then they came back and adopted him. That's weird! Those people are practically slaves. They say it's a better life for them. Only, when they get old, they're dumped in the asylum. Are you from here? I have no idea. I was left in the baby hatch, and I stayed. Nobody wanted me. At least you're married to Christ, aren't you? If you're to be a slave, let it be to the Holy Spirit. I haven't said my vows yet. Maybe we were baby hatch mates. You? Will you help me find my parents? - There you are! - Hello. Fernanda, this is Olegária, Álvaro's daughter. We're cousins then. I met your father when he came to see us in Rio. - How's he doing? - He's doing great. He lives on the ranch and I'm here because of college. - What are you studying? - Nutrition. Some of that please. Are you okay? I'm not feeling too well. Will you excuse me? Of course. Excuse us. They're dating? Isn't she Álvaro's daughter? They are first cousins! Tell me something new. The only person in this family who didn't marry a cousin is me. But between relatives... it isn't recommended, is it? You don't know the half of it. When a baby is born around here it's thrown up in the air. If it flies, it's a bat. - If it falls, it's a Fool. - Jesus Christ! Very funny, Paula... Your mother was clever, cousin. She faced up to everyone and left this shithole. She didn't really have a choice. Lucky you! Are you unhappy here, sweetie? I'm fucked off. Oh dear. What's the matter, Paula? He gets a honeymoon in the Caribbean, I went to Caldas Novas. I'm sorry, Paula. Is that why? Plus, they're getting Joana! How does Joana feel about that? Come on! Joana loves Pedro. Pedro, Pedro, Pedro. Don't you, Joana? Goiás is really something, isn't it? Cousins get married and they're given a human being. - Is that right? - That's right. In Goiás, we're all more or less family. Including the native Indians in the village we visited? By the way, how did you sort it out? Everything is fine. I even brought back some pequis. You like them? Never had any. It's a fruit. It's tasty and nutritious. Maybe that's why they gave them to you. Funny, they look like mangoes. No! You only eat the outer part. It's full of spikes inside. I got it. Are you sure? Sometimes you're better off on the surface. It's not always a good idea to dig deep into things. - Your little girl is getting big. - She getting big. Can I sit with you? Yes. They're watching TV and I hate soap operas. Why? In them, things that should be simple end up complicated. Everyone suffers. And they reveal the secret only at the end. - I go. Cold for baby here. - Okay. Do you have a doll too? I used to. When I was a girl. But I'm not a Fool. So why do you stay? Soap-opera stuff. Like those that make you laugh or cry? It depends. Some people cry. And others laugh. I see. Soap operas make me laugh and clowns make me cry. You and my mother would be about the same age, right? But you're still called Missy. Is that your real name? Luzia. They used to call me "Girl". "Girl, go get that!" "Watch the milk, Girl." "Feed the dog, Girl." Now I'm Missy. Until the day that I die. Missy? - Can you make us some coffee, please? - Yes. Thanks. - Let me take this. - No! Your mother took you away so you wouldn't have to do this. Hello? Hi. Right now? No, it's okay. I'll go. Where are you? Adoption files here are classified, top secret, confidential. Kept under lock and key. They're public records. I have the right to know. Oh come on, Fernanda. Try filing a request with the asylum board then. I just want to know how I'm going to get my cigarettes. Well then... - I brought two packs. - Now you're talking my language. Did you find anything? In 1983, three children were adopted aged six or seven. No newborns, though? There was a newborn in 1976. That can't be right. My mother said she got me here. There are other asylums around. Could she have lied to me? But why would she do that? Stop nosing around, Fernanda. That's ancient history, lay the past to rest. Come back tomorrow. I can sneak out around this time, we'll go dancing. Say, a karaoke? Do you like to dance? I do. - Do you have a boyfriend? - No. - You don't? - No. What's the first thing you notice about a man? The first thing I notice about a man... I don't know. - His mouth maybe? - His mouth! Your necklace is beautiful. Such a pretty stone. You can leave it with me, to remember you by. I can't. My mother gave it to me. Do you wear makeup? No. Do you like to sing? Yes. Here you go. Thank you. - See you tomorrow. - See you. I'll be waiting. Hi. Hi. - Would you like to see some magic? - No, thanks. Are you looking for your mother? - How do you know that? - I'm a magician, can't you see? Watch. How did you do that? I have a power. Some people don't believe it. I did that so you'd believe me. - What's your name? - Ezequiel. I believe you, Ezequiel. Beware of mad people, there are many of them here. Ezequiel! I was sent to deliver this to you. Great. Thanks. Pedro! Pedro! A phone call for you! Coming! Thank you. Thanks. Drink it, it's good. It'll get prettier when it rains. It's all dry now. Right. Chief, what is going on between you and the mayor? Are you a journalist? - No, I'm his niece. - Oh no! But I really would like to know. I'm also heir to these lands. But my uncle won't tell me anything. He says the river banks are his. We say they're ours. We put up a fence, he comes and knocks it down. He wants to divert the river course. So his cattle can drink. Can't you reach an agreement? He must change his mentality. That won't happen, will it? We can't live without water. It will be as it has to be. - And how is that? - By fighting. They put down the fence, we build it back up. They put us down, we come back to life. Like the flower that rises from ashes. It's beautiful. Can I ask you a favor? - Come into the water, Joana. - No. Scared. - Come on. - Scared. - A quick dip. - No. Scared. - I'll help you. - Scared. Come. Scared. Be careful, there's a rock here. Come. Easy. Good, isn't it? - Good water! - It is. - Can you wait a second? - Yes, wait. Cecília Figueiredo Menezes. This is for you. Is Fernanda already up? Here! - Good morning. - Morning. Why did you go the Indian village? I went to the stream, why? Don't meddle with that. I wanted to go to the stream my mother used to talk about. And it's on their land. And I don't like to be given orders. I'm protecting you. That Indian woman is treacherous. The Chief was very nice to me. Actually, we talked a lot. Nice until she finds out you're my niece. She knows. I told her. I'm not like you, uncle. What do you mean? I have no enemies. With that big mouth of yours! Just look around you, you'll find a dozen of them. - I'll wait in the car. - Go on, son. - Seriously, they need that water. - So do we. Can't we find a solution? Our cattle will die without water, you know? Honestly uncle, fuck the cattle! Okay, fuck my share then. I don't like women who curse. It's vulgar. - Can you stop by the store, please? - Very quickly! Okay. I'll finish getting ready in the car. Joana! Joana! Is this where you two sleep? - Ezequiel? - Uh-huh. Ezequiel... Farric', Ezequiel. - Is this the Farricoco? - Yeah. This is me? You! - Is that you with your doll? - Yeah, doll. Farricocos... - This is beautiful, Joana. - Beautiful, eh? And here? Cecília and me. When I... When I was five... No, three years old, they gave me away to the Menezes family. So I could play with Cecília. They gave you away? They said... my parents were gold-mine mestizos. And they worked at... at the ranch that belonged to Mr. Ivo. That old son of bitch who chased my mother away. Did the old man and the old woman let you go to school? No way. I did a bit of everything. So I... I washed, I cleaned, I took care of the animals. But Ceci taught me to read. "Ceci"? Funny, everybody called my mother "Ciça". Nobody knows I can read. But nobody knows I know everything! But why do you stay in this hell? Soap-opera stuff. To run away and have a house, that's soap-opera stuff. You work day and night. And look at this place! Look where you sleep! But I... I'm laying low. I'm playing dead. I'm just waiting. Waiting for what? The right moment. You're waiting for me? What? Me? Joana just told me... This is weird... Joana? Joana just spoke inside my head. Yours. You want me to keep it? Missy! We're here to launch a reconstruction project for Goiás, this town we love so much. We've been doing a great job for four years now. And we want another four years. As I see my son Pedro over there, who is running for a seat on the town council, I can't help but remember my wonderful childhood in this town. Back then, children could play freely on the streets. We could leave our doors open. I get emotional. And our mission is to rebuild all that. So that my grandson who's here, as you can see... Teach me now. What's all this? What's going on here? You've lost your mind! - Where's Missy? - She's gone. Gone where? - Don't be silly, that's impossible. - Why is it impossible? She has nowhere to go! She got up the courage and left. Without telling me? Oh my God! I can't believe it. I don't understand what's going on. I can't believe it! You've lost your wedding present. What did you do? What bullshit did you put in her head? Missy is my mother. Are you insane? You didn't know that? You didn't know the Menezes' big secret? Look here, I know nothing about that. You hear me? - You never heard anything? - I know nothing about that. - You didn't know? - Shut up, Fernanda! Shut your mouth! - Missy is my mother! - Shut up! She is my mother! Arlette called me. I had just arrived in Brasília and had to come back. What is going on here? I need you to tell me who I am. Can I have one of those? You are my sister's daughter. She raised you. She gave you a name and a life. Why did she never come back here? - You know why. - Not just because she was a lesbian. I've always known there was something else. Cecília... She didn't hide anything. She was brazen. Free. My father wanted to put her in the asylum, to get her out of his sight. Why did she take me with her? To save you. From what, Antônio? From being a slave? Fernanda... I'm in the middle of a campaign. I don't have the time or the energy right now to deal with family problems. Arlette is upset. Without Missy, she'll have too much work to do. I'd like you to leave tomorrow. Without answers? Without so many questions. Are you my father? You and Missy. I know it. I hear things. I saw you two. It's best you leave tomorrow. Are you going to force me to go? Only if I have to. You are my father! I was wondering if you saw Missy today. Did you see her around town? I did, but I didn't. She was no longer who she was. She was different? She wasn't invisible. Where do you think she is now? The time has come. Are you going to Goiânia? Where are you going to? To Aquidauana. Is it far? Quite far. So that's exactly where I'm going. Are you running from the police? No! I'm just trying to not mess up what was messed up from the start. Get in then. It's a long way, plenty of time to talk. I'm Vanda. I am Luzia. Luzia. Have a safe journey, Missy. Did you know she was my mother? I did. What's this? I told you that I'm heir to these lands. I've decided to donate my share to you. At least half of the stream is yours. What do I do with this paper? Bye, thanks. Fernanda? I thought you had gone away. Well, I haven't. Stop messing about, girl. Tell me a place or a country you like. Australia? New Zealand? - Are you trying to buy me out? - Cuba! Oh, Dad... Why don't you take me to Disneyland? Girl... My name is Fernanda. "Girl", "Missy"... That's what you call those women you think don't need a name. It's just how we talk. A fucked-up way to talk. I'm tired. Sick and tired. Of doing everything on my own. Trying to get along with everyone. First my father. Then Cecília, who thought I was an idiot. I don't pity you, Antônio. You're almost 60 years old. And you can't look me in the face and tell me the truth. What is done is done. - I don't want to fight, Fernanda. - But I do. I want to fight hard! I'll set this fucking town on fire until I know my story. I tried. I'm sorry. Are you locking me up in the cellar? Where are you taking me? Did you know your little boss is my daddy? Can't you speak? Take your hands off me, asshole! - Let me go! - Now you're gonna get it. - Get your hands off me! - You're gonna get it! Motherfucker! Ezequiel? For you. - For me? - Yeah. Why the wedding dress? I get married. Pedro. Engaged. - You're going to marry Pedro? - I marry Pedro. We want a strong family atmosphere. The cake is tall. It's hiding you, Arlette. - Goodness me. - Move it a bit to the right, please. - Like this? - That's right, perfect! That's perfect. Now, if you could move a bit to the left. Not to the left! Great. Good. - Camera? - Rolling. We're here with Mr. Mayor Antônio Menezes and his family for breakfast with the candidate who's standing for re-election. By his side, his wife Arlette and his children. Pedro is running for the town council. - And Paula is eight months pregnant. - Nine. Nine! It'll be any moment now. - Our first grandson. - Yes, one more Menezes. One more child of this blessed land. Mr. Mayor, it's your third term, this time with a new party. Why run for reelection? Because now, together, we need to work for our town. For our people. We need to finally bring the progress and development that our land deserves. To keep bringing. To keep bringing. This progress and development are already under way. Because we were born here. We grew up here. We know, like no one else, the challenges of our town. And more importantly, we know how to solve them. - Because... - Excuse me. Fernanda, excuse us. They're interviewing the family. But I am family, Arlette. What a funny scene. It's like Cinderella, the daughter that was locked up comes out for an interview. Ask any questions you want, dear. Turn that off. Turn it off! Paula, can you hold this for me? This is my mother's ashes and they will stay in this house. Take that away, Fernanda! - They're staying here. - Take that away. Oh Pedro, I'm so sorry... It's actually your cocaine. Antônio! Enough! Excuse us. She arrived on the procession day to wreak havoc in our home! Daddy, are you gonna lock me up in here? - Don't, I'm your daughter. - Joana, a broom. Quick! - I'm his daughter! - Devil! Arlette, can I call you "mom"? I think we'd better resume this interview some other day. I'm sorry, guys. That is obviously not cocaine. That's my niece, she has mental health issues. Daddy! Open this door, Daddy! - What should we do with her? - I don't know! Sort this out, Antônio! Get that girl out of here! Get rid of her, Antônio! Why don't we all go to Disneyland together? Let's be a happy family. You idiot! You fuckin' loser! Scum! Get me out of here! Are you going to sell me as a slave? Get me out of here! Antônio! Sorr', sorr', sorr'. Let me go! - Joana! - Sorr', sorr', sorr'. Help me, Joana! Joana! Time for your medication. What's that for? To help you rest and sleep a little. A relaxant. You see? Don't cry, don't cry. Look, this is my daughter. Novice! How are you? What am I doing here? It was your uncle. He said you were being aggressive and putting the whole family at risk. You didn't behave like a good girl. Do you think you can get me a cellphone? A cellphone? Fernanda, they took everything. I have to go away from here. You don't get it. The whole place is under surveillance. Wherever you look, they're watching you. There's no way out, sweetheart. But I have something amusing to tell you. I have a surprise for you! We can share my room! Do you understand? You can stay in my bedroom with me! Sweetie, I am not staying here. I'll go away. I thought I had a friend. But I am your friend. What an idiot I am! Novice, I am your friend. I'm stupid! I'm such an idiot! How about going out to buy some cigarettes? The two of us. Let's buy some cigarettes. For real? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Fernanda. Forgive me. - No worries. - I'm sorry! What a wonderful idea, my friend! We're going out to buy cigarettes! There's mass soon. Everyone goes to mass. Let's go to my room. We'll get ready and I'll find a way. Okay? I'll find a way! You're such a genius! Check out this dress! Do you have a dress for me? ASYLUM Are you out of your mind? You were in charge, it was your idea. If it was my idea, who pushed Marquinho? ASYLUM
