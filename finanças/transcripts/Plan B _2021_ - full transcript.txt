PLAN B There are many wonders that occur in this universe... One such wonder occurred in a village in Andhra Pradesh before separation. No one in that village were having babies. The villagers did everything they can to have babies. During such situations, a doctor visited that village. For some unknown reasons, men in that village have very less sperm count. The doctor understood that this is the reason behind them not having babies. He gave them medicines to overcome that. And they had babies. And the doctor became their God. But no matter how much he tried... One pair still ended up with no kids. Jyothi... -Tell me. -I'm going to Mumbai for urgent work. -OK? -When will you be back? Just 2 to 3 days. I'm just going to Mumbai. Call me if you need anything. OK? I'll be back soon. OK. Eat on time. Listen, stop at that boy who's asking for a lift. Where to? Just here, sir. The gold shop. What are you selling? You are too young to buy gold. -So that question. -That's... -Oh, a ring. For your girlfriend? -No no, no, sir. That's... My friend is in a hospital, sir. -Tell his dad. -Actually, it's his dad who's in hospital. -So you are selling your ring. -Yes... Yes, sir. As we are really good friends. What will you tell your parents? A lie for a good cause is not wrong, sir. -So... I'll say I lost it. -Super! Doing all this for a friend. Listen... -They might not buy the ring. -Sir, no, sir. -It's OK, keep it. -Sir, no, please! -Sir, we are here. -Stop. I'll get off here, sir. How will you go from here? OK, reach the hospital somehow. I'll take care of it, sir. Thank you, sir. Go fast! Sir, calm down. Take a seat. Look at this, sir. -Whose pictures are these? -My son, sir. Who sent you these? They came from my daughter-in-law's phone, sir. Are they both fighting? They used to be very close, sir. I don't know about recent situations, sir. OK, let's go. -Karthik... -Sir? -Let's break-in. -Yes, sir. Constable, switch on the light. You got the photos from this phone. -Karthik... -Sir. Ask the clues team to get fingerprints. OK, sir. Sir, if Jyothi is the killer... Do you think she'll leave her phone and gun here like this? Maybe she's misguiding us just because we'll think so. Yes, sir. We catch many killers while they try to escape us. But here, that's not the case. It's a very intelligent plan. -Yes, sir. -No matter who did this. It's my son who died. I beg you, sir. Please catch the killer, sir. We will, sir. Let's go. -Find her and get her to the station. -Yes, sir. Do you want tea or coffee? -I don't drink tea or coffee, sir. -Where's the dead body? -Tell me... Tell me... -Sir, my husband is a good man. If you are not the killer, how did a gun ends up inside a locked house? Who else can send photos from your phone? Tell me! To dear husband... I have no idea that they are many kinds of love. Killing my love... My parents got me married to you. Only then I understood. Unable to forget the man I love... Unable to cheat on you... I am living in literal hell. I know this is wrong. I have no other way but to leave. Goodbye! Before I left the letter there... I searched for my phone, sir. But I couldn't find it. But my husband's phone is there, in charging. To know if Jyothi is telling the truth or not... At the time the old man received the photos... We just need to see in which GPS track Jyothi's phone is in. : Good morning, sir. -Good morning. In Vishwanath's house, you didn't find his phone, but only Jyothi's, right? Yes, sir. But the fingerprints on the phone and the lock are Jyothi's sir. -On the gun? -No fingerprints, sir. But the blood marks on the gun and the lock belongs to the same person, sir. To know whose blood marks are those, we need to find Vishwanath's dead body. -Right? -Yes, sir. To know if Jyothi did this, we need to check her phone's GPS track. -Let's do that. Carry on. -Yes, sir. -Good morning, madam. -Good morning. You are? I'm here for the catering bill for your dad's tenth-day function, madam. Oh, OK. Just a minute. OK, madam. Hello... Police station? Where did you get these 10 crores from? My dad gave it to me. If you told that earlier, we would have deposited it in a bank at least. I didn't expect this. That cupboard, sir. Where can we get footage from the camera in front of your house? I'll show you, sir. Tell me this... Where did you get this money from? Who else knew about the money? Give me some details. Sure, sir. Brother, are they friends or lovers? Going by age, everyone thinks that they are lovers. Yes. But whether it's friendship or love... My daughter will always have her clarity. Brother, let's go find out if it's friendship or love. Hmm, let's go. When I say 'I love you', it doesn't mean that I like you above everyone. It means, you are one among the people I like. Is our love at a stage where we can live together? Or did it stop just at sharing feelings when we meet? It depends on my father's decision. Oh... I understand that your father stands first in the list of people you like. Yes. Even if I never saw my mom... I feel her every day in the love of my father. Will he accept our love? If they believe that their kids will be happy, parents will never say 'No'. What happened, dear? Dad! I have no idea who they are... Shame that you came back thrashed. It's OK. Just a minute. Some random guy saved your daughter. -Or else... -Hey! You can do nothing. You and your daughter... I'll slice you both so good! This is too far! I know what to do to handle you. Get off the phone! Idiot! -Are you OK? -You don't worry. -Thanks! -No no, it's OK, sir. Brother, they look superb together. It's time for the wedding bells! Yes. My daughter's marriage should be as loud as it can get. Thank you, dad. Stop! I have to call my daughter! I have to call my baby! Dad, here are the papers you asked for. Listen... Call our lawyer. Here, dad. -Sir... -Tell me, sir. You helped me a lot! But I'm leaving without paying you back. Why are you saying all this, sir? -Damn! -I'll send you the land papers, sir. Why don't you send them directly, sir? Sending my daughter to Saddam's place... It's not safe. That's why I'm requesting you. OK, sir. Give them to Avanthika. I'll be in touch with her. Thank you, sir. Dear... Hand these papers to the lawyer. -OK, dad. -Careful, dear. Bye. -Hello! -Good morning. I'm coming to meet you. But an urgent call stopped me. OK. I can understand. Yeah, sir. Little important. I'll finish that and come to meet you. -OK OK. -I'll come as soon as possible. Thank you. How are you? I'm really tensed about what might happen next, sir. What for? I'm here, right? Give that. Wait, I'll just come. Nothing will happen to your dad. Don't worry. Wait here. : Cheers! In the happiness of sending him to the hospital... This tastes much better, baby. It will taste even better once you get the land papers. Brother... Welcome, lawyer sir! Please sit. Rajendra's land papers. Lawyer sir... Roaming around the court all these days... Your client Rajendra wasted a lot of money. I offered money in return for a favour... But you didn't sell your character. See what happened now... Rajendra is on his death-bed. I need to leave. Take these and handover the money. -Go get the bag. -OK, brother. What, lawyer... You are not wishing me, at least for namesake. I don't know how many people have suffered because of you. But seeing what Rajendra's family is going through, I just feel like killing you. He bought that land for 10 crores. But the present rate is 50 crores. I said I'll pay 10 crores, but he said no. And now he's on his death-bed. Such a fool! Here is the money. Take them to your father. I'll go meet the judge and come. OK? -OK, sir. -Go fast. Take care of your dad. -How is he, sister? -He's still critical, madam. I brought the money, dad. There are 10 crores in this bag. Give 5 crores... ...to the place that took care of me as a kid and made me a police officer. The orphanage I grew up in. You keep the remaining five. OK, dad. Dad... Dad... Dad! So only you and lawyer Vishwanath knew about this money? -Yes, sir. -But as you all think... This theft didn't happen when you went to Rajahmundry. It happened two days before that day. At 8 PM. -What? -Your CCTV footage says so. Where are you at that exact time? I and Gautham went out at 8 and came back by 11, sir. Theft happened during that time. -What's Vishwanath to you? -He's a well-wisher to our family. A trustworthy person, sir. Once you kept that money in the cupboard, did you see it again afterward? No, sir. He focused the torch onto the CCTV all the time. I'm sure that he's a professional. I think I have seen a similar case somewhere. We'll catch the thief soon. Don't worry. Hand me a written complaint. I'll see the end of Saddam, who killed your dad. Please don't file a police complaint on Saddam. He's a moron. Sorry, sir. The foundations of the under-world... They are built over the hearts of the cowards. The fear in us will keep fueling the rage of the evil. Being a retired police officer's daughter... Let's go! -Good morning, sir. -Good morning. Morning... Sit! Sir, we traced the GPS track of Jyothi's phone, sir. Good. Tell me something. Where is her phone when the old man got the photos? -At the ghost bungalow, sir? -Ghost bungalow? Yes, sir. Hello! OK. Sir... They found Vishwanath dead body at the ghost bungalow, sir. -Check it and update me. -Sir. Someone shot him at point-blank. Yes, sir. It doesn't seem like Vishwanath and the killer fought before that. Vishwanadh started for Bombay... I don't understand why he came here. As per his character, there is no chance he had any enemies. Vishwanath wife's lover... He might have done it. I don't think that... ...we'll find the money, Gautham. We can't be so sure about that. The police are trying their best to catch the thief. We'll get him. Don't worry. For dad's last wish to come true... We have to give 5 crores to the orphanage. Yes. Let's sell off my land back in the village. I can't trouble you, Gautham. We are going to live together. How come our properties be not common? Your and mine... It's just ours. According to the evidence, we found at the ghost bungalow... -I have some doubts, sir. -What are your doubts? The one who killed Vishwanath... -He took his index finger! -Yes, sir. As per our clues, there is a bullet in Vishwanath body. And we found another bullet that went into the ground, sir. No! What I'm thinking is... What does Vishwanath killer have to do with his index finger? I too don't get it, sir. We also got another interesting evidence near the dead body, sir. What's that? We got this half torn 500 note near the dead body, sir. -Avanthika... -Sir? What's the denomination of the money your father gave you? Only 2000 notes. A half torn 500 note... Is it hawala? If that's the case, why do they need his finger, sir? Actually you are right! The real story is something else. Three people had alcohol, 100 meters from the dead body, sir. To know if the drinkers have any connection to this murder... Link the fingerprints on the glass with Aadhar. We'll get photos, address, and all other details. -Do that, Vishruth. -OK, sir. Come on! Pick... Pick... -Brother? -Hey... No matter where and how you are, come home immediately. -Got it? -OK, brother. OK... OK. -Happy morning, sir. -Morning. Sir I need to meet your urgently. -Are you at the station? -That urgent? -Yes, sir. Urgent, sir. -Come to the station. OK, sir. On my way. Sir, these are the photos of the three drinkers, sir. -Happy morning, sir. -Morning, Gautham. What's so urgent? I got an important clue in Vishwanath murder case, sir. What? Here, sir. I got it in my brother's pant pocket. Get the half note we found at Vishwanath dead body. OK, sir. It's a match. Why did you kill Vishwanath? -Sir, I have to give you something. -No need. Please accept this gift, sir. -No no. -Please don't say no, sir. I'm very happy now, sir. Thank you, sir. -Thank you. -This is too much! -Right here, sir. -Stop. I'll get off here, sir. -Hi, dude. -Hi. I gave him the rold-gold ring and got the money. Full cut note. We still have 4,500 bucks. Let's go. -Let's have fun! -: Let's go. : Cheers! Man, I feel scared. Let's get out of here. Let's go take a look. No no, listen to me. Let's go home. We can say only if we go see him. Let's go. Brother... Brother... -Brother... -: Who is he? -He is the one who gave me the money. -: Is it? -Brother, get up. -He died, dude. -We might get into trouble. Let's go. -Brother... God! That ring might have my fingerprints. I need to get it. One minute... What happened to the ring? Where did it go? It's not on this hand too. Where did it go? That is what happened, sir. So he had his index finger, but just the ring is missing. Is it? -Yes, sir. -Are you sure? Yes, sir. I'm very sure. So you guys went there after the killer left. After you left, he came back... He shot the finger and took it away. So he did all this, just for that finger. Yes! I... I'm sorry, brother. On their death bed, mom and dad asked me to take care of you. It doesn't mean that I should just save you from problems. If you are going to cause someone else pain and tears... My brought up shouldn't be the reason. Brother... You proved that system is greater than individual, duty greater than relations. Thank you, sir. -Good morning, Santhosh. -Good morning, sir. -We are tracing Vishwanath phone, right? -Yes, sir. Check where is the last GPS track on the day he died. One second, sir. In his home, sir. His phone might have been switched on for just two minutes. -Check that. -OK, sir. Yes, sir. You are right. Inform us if it gets switched on again. -Sure, sir. -Thanks. Search the surroundings carefully. -What are we looking for, sir? -Vishwanath finger. -Sir? -100% it will be here. -Search carefully. -OK, sir. I'll inform you, sir. Sir! How are you so sure of it, sir? Vishrudh... What might have actually happened is... Jyothi might have looked for her phone before she left that house forever. She didn't find it. So she saw her husband's phone in the charging, being switched off... She understood that he took her phone and she went away. With his phone in the charging, he took his wife's phone... And he went to meet someone at the ghost bungalow. The one he met shot Vishwanath to death... He took the photos with his wife's phone... And have sent them to a contact on WhatsApp, saved as 'Uncle'. Why did he send those photos to Vishwanath father, sir? To divert the murder case on to Vishwanath wife. What else should it be? After that, he went to Vishwanath home and placed the phone and gun. Simple! He switched on the phone that's on charging... Opened the lock with this finger... And he might have deleted some video on it. He switched off the phone again, locked the door... He threw the finger away and he left. As the killer diverted the case on to Jyothi... We arrested her as per the evidence we got. So Jyothi has nothing to do with this murder, right sir? We can't say that just yet, Vishrudh. Jyothi might have ordered the hit. Possible! Yes, sir. There is a chance for that. So are we going to catch the killer, sir? He deleted a video on the phone, which means he's in that video. If our Cyber Crime department can recover the deleted video... -We can get the killer. -Super, sir. -Good morning, sir. -Vishruth, Good morning. Tell me. The deleted video from Vishwanath phone... We couldn't recover it, sir. We are not being able to recover it, even after using advanced software... He might be a technical expert, or have got some great assistance. -Yes, sir. -Who the hell is he! Rishi... Rishi... You have to go to the basketball court, right? You wake up before the alarm goes off, right? What happened to you today? Get up! I know how to wake you up. Rishi! Rishi... Rishi... Get up, Rishi! I locked the door after dinner, before we went to bed, sir. And I opened the door only in the morning. Love is like a beautiful dream... But marriage is the reality you wake up to. How can I kill him, sir! The murder happened inside the locked door. Who else will do this, if not you? I married him, unable to kill my love towards him. Now how can I kill the man I love, sir? OK... Tell me what happened last night. In detail! -Rishi! I permitted you only for the weekend, but you are drinking all week! What's all this? I just had an extra peg. Oh! Is that why you switched off your phone? Sorry... I lost my phone. You lost it! Rishi... Rishi... I'm getting a call from your number. Get up... Get up, Rishi. -Rishi... Get up! -Don't disturb me. -Get up, Rishi. -Hello! -Hello... I found this phone. It belongs to my husband. Can you come take it now? This late? I'm going out of station tomorrow. Tell me your address. I'll come hand it to you. -Hello! -Hello... I'm here. Right in front of your gate. -Oh, OK. I'm coming. -Yeah, OK. This is a pre-planned murder. The one with whom your husband had drinks, he stole his phone... He made you walk out of the house, saying that he found the phone... And he killed your husband before you came back in. Who is he? Why did he kill Rishi? Do you suspect anyone? I have sent goons to kill your husband and you sent them back, thrashed... One day... I'll kill your husband. Who's voice is this? My uncle. I thought he would get me married, taking my father's place. But he planned to be the father of my kids, sir. This is definitely your uncle's doing. Call him and talk to him as I say. -Hello! -Uncle... Rishi died, uncle. -I'm so happy! -Please, stop it, uncle! -Tell me. -They think that I killed Rishi. The police are about to arrest me, uncle. -You have to save me. -Will you listen to me then? -I will. -I'm coming... With bail papers. Sir... Rishi wrote down this phone number on his arm, before he died, sir. We got the killer! But sir, he wrote just seven numbers. He died before he finished the last three. These numbers can be the killer's phone number... Or even a clue, sir. Missing three numbers will count to 1000, according to permutations & combinations. So the killer's number will be in those 1000 numbers, sir. Correct. I need those 1000 numbers and fingerprints. OK, sir. You don't get tensed. -Good morning, sir. -Good morning. You... You are Geetha's uncle, right? See how famous I am! -No no. I recognized you by your voice. -Nice, sir. -You sing so well, right? Sir, Geetha is an innocent girl, sir. She has nothing to do with this murder, sir. -Is it? -Yes, sir. Let's look into that later. First, you sing that song. Which song, sir. -God! -You sang a song, remember? -Sir! -Sing in rhythm! How can I get a rhythm with you thrashing me, sir? -Speak out! Speak out! -Damn... Sir! Sir, even if you thrash and kill me... I'm telling you the truth, sir. I swear on my mother, sir. I had nothing to do with Rishi's murder, sir. A man's eyes will tell us if he's guilty or not! He didn't kill Rishi. Then who did? Vishruth, does anyone match with Rishi's circle of friends and relatives? There is a match with Gautham's number, sir. -Really? -Yes, sir. Really? No Vishruth, he's not that kind of a person. He brought in his own brother. Yes, sir. Rishi might have left us a clue through Gautham's number, sir. Possible. Ask him to come to the station once. -Happy morning, sir. -Hi, Gautham. Morning! -How are you? -I'm pretty good, sir. How are you? OK, tell me something... Do you know a man named 'Rishi'? Sir... Rishi is my cousin, sir. He's a very nice guy. What happened, sir? Nothing! Tell me... Did Rishi ever discuss any problem with you? Sir... Once he told me that someone sent him a death warning, sir. Sir, just to give this clue to the police... Rishi might have written Gautham's phone number as he died, sir. What? Rishi is dead! -Yes. -The one who warned Rishi... Did Rishi tell you why? I think he owes Rishi some money, sir. He said he warned him when he asked for his money back. -Who's he? -I have no idea... But... Rishi gave me a number, asking me to observe him, sir. Do you have that number with you? It's him, sir. He's Saddam's right hand man. He killed Rishi for sure. -Thank you, Gautham. You may leave. -OK, sir. Bring him in when he switches on his phone. OK, sir. Sir, his phone was switched on, sir. -Where is the GPS track locating? -Jubilee Hills, sir. Extend to this screen. -Vishruth, go ahead. Quick! -Yes, sir. Hey! What happened? Why are you so angry? Rishi's phone was off. We have to catch him. Let's go. -Police! -He's getting away. Catch him. -Come on, move! -Sir... What happened, sir? -Move! -Tell me what the problem is, sir. -Please! -Get in! Sir, tell me, sir. Please! Hey... A house will change into a villa with easy money. Car will replace the bike. Your luxuries keep roaming in foreign countries. But once the police get you... you are back to jail food. Why are you people missing such a small logic? Tell me... Why did you kill Rishi? -Tell me! -Sir... What really happened was... I'll slice you both real nice! This is too far! I know how to take care of you. Get off the phone! Brother, only when we kill those who talk back to us... The living will fear us! -They'll get scared of us. -How can you get to him so fast? Using his phone's GPS track. -Bring in that bastard. -OK. Come on, Munna. He's coming in search of his death. Why did you leave him, without killing him then and there? Only when our life is leaving out of us... Anger will turn into love. Listen... We would have got the papers by now. Call and confirm. Tell me, Munna. Brother, did Rajendra send his land papers? Anger turned into love, and the land papers... Came running to me! Hey... They got the papers. We can be at peace if we kill him now. And he will rest in peace. Hey, let's go... There are 10 crores in this bag. Give 5 crores... ...to the place that took care of me as a kid and made me a police officer. The orphanage I grew up in. OK, dad. You keep the remaining five. -We saved a bullet. -Let's go. Get down. Hey, wait here. Indicate me if anyone comes. -OK? -OK. Hey... Did he see us? 50 - 50 chances. He lives in our area. -But let's not take any chances. Let's go. -Right! -At 5 in the morning... -OK... We have to shift this bag. -Set an alarm at 5 when we get back home. -OK. -OK? -OK. Let's go. -Hey, where is the bag? -Where is the bag? He might have took it away. -We have to catch him before he runs away. -: Let's go. -Munna, he's here. -Let's go. -Who the hell are you? -You took our money bag... -Don't act smart. -I didn't touch that money bag. Do you think we'll believe that? I said I didn't touch that bag. Where is your phone? You have one day. This is my number. I'll call you tomorrow. You have to tell me where the money bag is. Or else, I'll kill you and your wife. Get it into your head. One day! Remember. Sir... I indeed warned him, sir. But it's not me who killed him, sir. Please believe me, sir. According to his story, what Rishi told Gautham is true. Is Rishi's murder connected with Vishwanath's murder! To think that the same killer killed both... Both the bullets came from different guns. So there might be an entirely different story behind these two murders. What's that? Vishruth, call Geetha to the station urgently. Sir, you wanted to see me? There's an automatic call recorder on this phone, right? -Yes, sir. -The one who called you that night... -Yes, sir... -Play that recording once. OK, sir. -Hello! -Hello... I found this phone. It belongs to my husband. Can you come take it now? This late? I'm going out of station tomorrow. Tell me your address. I'll come hand it to you. -OK, thank you. -What happened, sir? I got a small clue. Let's go Vishruth. -Hi! -Hi, Gautham. I sold off the land. Here are 5 crores. You can't believe your eyes, right? Gautham, where did you get this money from? -I sold my land... -I want the truth, Gautham. It's you who stole the money, right? Please, Gautham... My dad gave me this money bag. Don't try to lie to me. Damn the bloody life! With 10 crores at hand, I felt lazy to buy a bag worth 1k. And this is what happens! Even a shadow with the knowledge of the truth is dangerous. Such a nice twist, right Gautham? You changed your voice... But you forgot to use different words. I mean... 'Happy morning'. Happy morning, sir! The clue, 'Happy morning', ratted you out, Gautham. A Raspberry looks so beautiful outside... But once you cut it, worms fall out. Brother... -Hi. -How are you? I'm good. -When did you come to Hyderabad? -Recently. Is it? What are you doing now? Working as PE teacher in a private college. Is it? -Cheers! -Cheers! Actually, I called you for a reason. Tell me, brother. Let's take it home? If the police get to know about the theft... They'll check the houses of usual suspects like us. So even our house is not safe. What to do now? I know a secret location. Let's go. You have one day! This is my number. I'll call you tomorrow. You have to give me the location of the money bag. Or else, I'll kill you and your wife. Get it into your head. One day! Remember. That's what happened. -What should I do now? -That money bag... -You have to give it to him. -Me? -You do it, brother. -His phone was switched off, brother. I don't know when he'll switch it on. If my wife gets to know about this... -She'll leave you for sure. -Please help me out! OK, brother. I'll take care of it. Brother... Take down his phone number. Yeah, tell me. 98... 98490... -Brother... -Yeah? -I'll go take a leak. -OK. -Listen... -What, brother? -Do you want some help? -No, brother. OK, careful, brother. Brother, I paid the bill. Let's go. Why did you pay? I would have paid, brother. I paid. Let's go. How much is this? -I didn't find time to count. -OK. Why do we care? We need to hand him his bag. -That's it, right? -That's it. Once you reach him on phone, give it to him. -Did I give you his number? -Yes, you did. -What happened? -I... I lost my phone. -It's gone. -Might have forgotten in the restaurant. Let me call. -It's switched off. -Someone might have stolen it. Give me your phone number. If he comes here for the money, I'll give him your number. -90... -9... -300... -03... -67... -00... 7. Bloody pen is not working. You come home tomorrow. -You have to give him this bag. -OK, brother. I'll take care of that. -Hello! -Hello! Happy morning! -I found this phone. -That belongs to my husband. -Can you come get it now? -This late? I'm going out of station tomorrow. Give me your address. I'll come to hand it to you. OK, thank you. The address is... Yeah, OK. I'll be there. -Hello! -Hello! I'm here. Right in front of your gate. -Oh, OK. I'm coming. -Yeah, OK. -Why did you kill my client? -Me? How can you say that? See? Tell me now. Why did you kill him? He might ask for a share in the money. -Speak out! -Sir... We are converting black money into white, tomorrow midnight at ghost bungalow. We are getting a huge commission from that transaction, sir. Oh! So you killed Rishi to get the entire commission. Yes, sir. That's why I killed him. -Let's take this to the police station. -Sir sir sir... You can have the whole commission, sir. Are you offering me money? You killed Rishi for this commission. Now Geetha's life is ruined. Sir... Sir, I'll hand you the entire commission, sir. You hand it over to Geetha. Give me a chance to correct my mistake. Please, sir. Once Geetha gets the commission money, I'll get him arrested. -If you act smart... -Sir, you have the video with you. If you find anything fishy, you hand it over to the police. Don't give me ideas. Move! Why are you here at this time, sir? -Hello, lawyer Vishwanath... -Hello, sir. Where are you, sir? I'm still busy. Tell me where you are. I'll come get your signature. -I'm really far. -Is it? I'll be home in two hours. OK, sir. I'll meet you at your home. OK, bye. While I was waiting there, I saw you sneak in and followed you. And I captured you, as you shot him. We went to Rajahmundry to leave Avanthika's father's ashes in Godavari. At what time did the priest ask us to come, Gautham? Ah, he said 7 O'clock. -OK, goodnight. -Yeah, goodnight. Avanthika... Avanthika... I put my phone on silent and started off from that place. -What's late? -There are not here? No. Call them once. OK, sir. Phone... Sir, I forgot my phone in hurry. -Can I use your phone? -Yeah, sure. Damn! My phone was switched off. So I brought my wife's phone. I wanted to delete the video on your phone. You messed it up, man! I thought it's mine. Here, call them. -What happened? -Switched off, sir. -What to do now? -They will be here, sir. Let's wait. -OK. I'll go take a leak. You be here. -OK, sir. I don't care who killed me. I just want him dead anyway. He brought his wife's phone and made her the prime suspect. Damn! To delete my video on his phone... I need his finger. Damn! Huh! He opened the lock with the same finger! Why is it not opening now? I need to take an expert's help and make sure the police won't find this video. Nice! I already booked flight tickets from Rajahmundry to Hyderabad. Finishing my plan in Hyderabad... I came back to Rajahmundry. That morning, we performed the ritual and came back to Hyderabad by train. Such a great plan! On this Earth, rather than good people, there are more people who act good. Just like you. Some do it as they are scared. And some just lack opportunity. That makes them look like good people. We all have a hero inside us. He gives lift to a school kid, hands some money to the old lady on the roadside. He hates the tiger that's chasing a deer. He prays to God, that the little girl in the manhole should come out alive. He reacts so strongly about a wrong deed on social media. But if he gets the opportunity, he chases the deer called society. You thought you are a hero. But with the right opportunity, the villain came out. When a lie keeps you happy and the truth hurts you... It means you took the wrong way. But if a lie hurts you and the truth makes you happy... It means you are inspirational to many. Parents will say yes to marriage, considering the properties. But girls... They just want to be loved, as her parents love her. They want a happy life with the man they love. But never with the money that came through the wrong ways. Sir, this is a written complaint on Saddam. What? Did you lose the fear of death? No man who did a wrong thing should go unpunished, sir. Good! Vishruth... Sir. I don't understand who killed Vishwanath and why! He didn't even leave a small clue. He did this murder very cleverly! I got it Vishruth! Let's go. Come on, quick. What brings you back, sir? -Where is the cash bag? -What happened, sir? Bring it out. Urgent! Go get it. What happened, sir? What happened, sir? The entire 10 crores is fake currency. So Saddam might have given them fake notes. Yeah, maybe... Give me the land papers. Here are your land papers. -Thank you, sir. -Come on, let's go. Open the cell. The notes you gave Vishwanath... Are they original, or fake? Tell me. Original notes, sir. Tell me the truth. I'm telling you the truth, sir. Original notes. I gave them original notes, sir. I swear on God. So someone might have swapped the currency without Saddam knowing of it. Such a clever trap! Such a sharp criminal! Who's the one who planned all this? Hey... One minute. I'm not your husband as think. Listen to me... I'm not your husband. -Actually what happened is... -Enough with your drama! Even if I lie now, you'll get to know the truth slowly. Believe me. Actually, I'm not your husband. You can verify it through a video call. You are right. You are someone else. Who are you then? My name is Vishwanath. I'm a lawyer in Hyderabad. There are many wonders that occur in this universe... No one in that village are having babies. My dad gave them medicines to overcome that. And they had babies. And he became their God. But no matter how much he tried... One pair still ended up with no kids. Rajappa and Shankaramma. The reason behind only you people not having kids is... Rajappa is impotent. What should we do now, doctor? There is a process called artificial insemination. Through this process... If we can inject a donor sperm into your womb, you can have kids. -Will it works, sir? -There is a chance. But only if you want to go for it. Here. Sir, what happened, sir? -What happened, sir? -Your husband killed someone. Sir... Sir... After few days Rajappa went to jail... The artificial insemination went successfully and Shankaramma got pregnant. Thank you, doctor. Even if we can become parents naturally... I have been pregnant through his experiment. They both had boys. Because of dad's sperm, they both have his features. Those kids used to confuse the entire village. After few years, Rajappa came out. What, Rajappa? Are you coming directly from jail? You are such a lucky man! You have got a son, even without working for it! What the hell are you talking about? Hey... What's there to get surprised about? This is what the entire village thinks. Your son and the doctor's son look exactly the same. Also, what more proof do you need? The father to your son is the doctor. Get lost! Why are you so dull today? Kids in my school are commenting that I am the doctor's son. Is that true, mom? You were born because of him. Hey! Dad, don't hurt mom. So you guys made a fool out of me! Dad, leave her. The entire village is true! Please, dad! After I went to jail, you and that doctor... -Dad... -Don't call me that. How dare you? Characterless! -Dad, please don't hurt mom. -Get lost! So you guys made a fool out of me! The entire village is true! After I went to jail, you and that doctor... What? What's that? God! Rajappa's son killed my mom and dad, right in front of my eyes. God! He proved that I did all the murders. And that fool made me do jail time for them. I have been inquiring about him from the day I came out of jail. Just after a few days, we got married, I came to see his real face. I know everything about you. I know how you fought. I know he'll kill you if you don't divorce him. I even know that you are hiding here, scared of him. That's why I came in search of you. A moron like him has no right to live on this Earth. To do that, I need your help. -Tell me what to do. -Very simple... Be close with him and made him believe that you'll withdraw the divorce. So... Make him come to that place on time, wearing the dress I described. OK. Did you recognize me, Mr. Vishwanath? Son of Rajappa. You killed my parents, sent me to the jail, and took my identity. Oh, it's you! Now I'll kill you and will take your identity. Please... Don't kill me. No! No, listen to me! Happy journey! In the eyes of police and the society, lawyer Vishwanath died. I'm Abhiram. I took back my identity. You can have your divorce as you wished and lead a happy life. Thank you, sir. Bye! Bye. PRESENT DAY MUMBAI Wow! What a brilliant plan! Without letting them know that it's our plan... You made me talk to Saddam... And take over Rajendra's land. Why did you target Rajendra? Dad... Dad... Dad, wake up! Mom! Dad! Sir sir sir... Rajappa's son killed my mom and dad. And he hit me too. He's on the run, sir. -He killed two people there and two here. -Dad! -So we got the right information. -Dad! Mom! -Come on, move! -Dad! -Spread out and search for me. Move! -OK, sir. -Hey, stop! -Sir sir sir... -Why did you kill these people? Tell me. -Sir, leave me, sir. I tried to tell him that I'm not Rajappa's son, but I's the doctor's son. But Rajendra didn't listen to me. Please, sir. Believe me, sir. Being a police officer, he didn't do a proper inquiry. If he did so, Rajappa's son would have gone to jail for killing my parents. Now I'm Rajappa's son in the eyes of society. Sir, believe me, sir. I'm the doctor's son, sir. Not Rajappa's son. Sir! Just because of Rajendra. Rajendra's negligence brought him his death. Why did you frame Gautham in Abhiram's murder case? What did I do? He should be facing jail in Rishi's murder case anyway. When I asked Gautham why he killed Rishi... We are going to get a huge commission from that transaction, sir. I knew he's lying. He planned to be at the ghost bungalow, kill me, and delete the video. That's why I took my wife's phone. Damn! My phone was dead and I brought my wife's phone. I made Vishwanath come there right by that time... I said I'll take a leak, and went on to kill Vishwanath. He thought that it's me who died. He planned to frame my wife for that. So he sent photos from my wife's phone to my dad's phone. I put my wife's phone, house keys, and id proofs in his pocket... And I took his id proof. Gautham has no idea that I captured his pictures as... ...he shot for the finger, and sent it to the police. My dad cried a lot, thinking that I died. Your parents died, right? Who's this Ramulu? Ramulu used to work in the jail. He took care of me like his own son. He even adopted me and made me a lawyer. Son... This girl has cheated on us! -What did she do? -She stole 10k from the 10 crores. -You just counted 10 crores? -Yeah! Play the footage that we saw last time. That... That one... Zoom it. Two people had the same plan at the same time. That's plan B. Gautham went to Rajahmundry by train... Came back to Hyderabad by flight killed Vishwanath... Planned to marry his girlfriend, and live a happy life with the stolen 10 crores. Not knowing that they are fake notes. Vishwanath went to Bombay by flight... And came back the same day to Hyderabad by bus. There is a huge plan behind this for sure. -Inquire about that plan at once. -Sir. Right. What the hell is that plan! THE POLICE WANT TO CATCH VISHWANADH'S KILLER AT ANY COST. ABHIRAM ALIAS VISHWANADH HAD MADE A PLAN SO TIGHT... THAT NO ONE CAN CATCH HIM. WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT?
