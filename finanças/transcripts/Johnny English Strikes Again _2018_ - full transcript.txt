Apparently, you just speak to it normally. The pleasure's all mine. Hate to rush you, but was there something in particular - you needed? - Actually, I was just calling, really, to see if you had had a chance to think things over. I have. But the thing is, Fiona, I just don't really do other people's security. Not that I don't want to. But your infrastructure is old. Plus, the only way I could keep you secure in the meantime would be by storing all your data on my own servers. - Obviously, that would be... - Yes.

Impressive work in France, by the way. When did you realize I was a spy, too? Oh, pretty much straightaway. - Mm. - Hmm. I've spent two years undercover. Simple operation until you showed up. And I like to keep things simple. Simple is my middle name. - (DOOR OPENS) - (GASPS SOFTLY) MAN: Yeah, I hear you.

Give me your phone. You don't have a phone? A phone will give anyone your precise location. And yet they're so useful for making phone calls. - VOLTA: Excellent. - I'm not phoning anyone. I'm gathering evidence. XANDER: The target list, Jason. Four iconic Central London landmarks. - Make your selection. - Number three. XANDER: The London Eye?

Good afternoon, Prime Minister. - So, this is, uh... - English, Prime Minister. Johnny English. What exactly do you have to say for yourself? Rather a lot, actually. - Ah. - (CHUCKLES) However, men like me don't deal in prevarication, Prime Minister. So let me get straight to the point. Jason Volta is the man behind these attacks, and I have the evidence to prove it. I managed to record this inside Volta's country lair. But I should warn you, Prime Minister, that what you're about to see is evil incarnate. (INHALES) Mm. Here we are at Fifi's third birthday, and it's a very exciting day!

Uh, I don't remember... Do you have any idea how hard it is to be me? - Uh... - Hmm? Do you have even the foggiest notion of how virtually impossible it is to get anything done in the face of events and facts and voters and that tsunami of tosspots we call the national press?
