[whimsical music] [kids] I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic, for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. [fanfare music] My fellow citizens, our nation has been faced with a dramatic increase in terrorism and crime. That all stops now. From now on, there will be no pardons. There will be no excuses for anyone bringing terror into this state. I attended this execution to prove to the people of Florida that I believe in real punishment, not empty words. Fuck you! Governor, Carol Burke, FSN. Is the state of Florida -getting into show business? -No, Carol. Marty Rockman is a responsible television producer. These people came to my office with this idea of Citizen Verdict. I thought it fit in perfectly with the war against crime that I've been leading in our state. That's it. Thank you very much. [theme music] I'm Marty Rockman. I own this station. But more significantly, I'm American. And, like you, I am outraged by the escalating crime that threatens our civil existence. To be honest, our justice system has failed. You know it, I know it. Crime goes unpunished. Criminals go free. I'm prepared to offer you change. With the cooperation of our Governor from the great state of Florida, I'm prepared to give justice back to you, the citizen, by simply to put justice back into your hands. Here's what I'm gonna do. We're gonna televise criminal trials in a three hour format, live. And at the end of that trial, you, the viewer, will get to vote guilt or innocence. If you vote guilty in a murder trial, I'm gonna televise the execution. Our first trial is Friday night at seven. Justice finally for real. Citizen Verdict...Be there. [commentator] That's right. You, the public, will decide which of these three accused murderers, now awaiting trial in Florida, will be the first defendant onCitizen Verdict. I rather for it to be with the 12 man jury while they're sitting there, they can see the emotions, they can, they can see everything and then, instead of somebody just on TV, "Oh, he's not guilty." Cause they got a whole bunch of mystery shows on TV, and you can sit back and pick, "Oh, he's guilty. She's guilty." You'll be there and see the actual evidence yourself. I think any time you have the general population making the decision rather than a handful of people who have been tweaked by prosecutors and defense attorneys, you're not better off. It would definitely... ...definitely be big. I know that. Um... I'll most definitely watch it. If it's not corrupt, I think it would be a wonderful idea. The problem is a practitioner that I have with it... simply is, uh... You're risking due process violations, um, on a regular basis in a trial that you show on television, um, under those circumstances. And I'm not sure if that is worth the gamble. I, I feel that most of the majority of the reality shows that are out today are truly exploiting. I think it's a very strong system, uh, considering that the United States has, uh, diversity of population. And being a huge country, they have to have a powerful system to control the crime. I think in the, uh, the, the system is designed in a way where they can-- It's a demographical situation. And they can get, they can, they can go to a certain area and get the type of people that they want, and bring on a jury, and get the verdict they want. So of course I would like the, the mass of people. [opening music] Good evening. We're here with Marty Rockman, better known for the hit reality show, So Sue Me. Marty, I gotta tell you, [laughs] call it cheesy, I don't care, but I watch So Sue Meall the time. Well, thank you very much. So tell me about your new show, Citizen Verdict. Love to do that. I'd love to do it. You know, Marty, it is causing a lot of controversy down here with the public and in the media. As expected. And it's set down in Florida? It's not set in Florida, it happens in Florida because we're dealing here with real people and real justice. And you're gonna show real murder trials in Florida? In Tampa. And all registered Florida voters who watch the show are eligible to vote on the jury? That's right. In fact, we've even set up a system to make sure that no one votes twice. Okay. Let's see what the Republican Governor of California, Charlie Behr, has to say. Good evening, Governor. Hello, Troy. Governor, what is your take on what's happening down in Florida? It's a circus down there. Citizen Verdicthas nothing to do with justice or democracy. It's a political trick. But more important, in my opinion, is that it goes against everything that the Constitution of the United States stands for. Excuse me, Governor. [Behr] No, you wait. Your show is an insult to the citizens of this country, Trialing people, and if convicted, having them executed on television, what are you trying to do? Bring us down to the level of Iran or Iraq? And I'm warning you for the last time, I've consulted with my fellow governors and some of the finest lawyers in this country, and we intend to obtain an injunction to stop your show from going on the air. Run for president on somebody else's time, Governor. I'm promising you this, you might as well write it down nothing and nobody bring on all the lawyers you want, nothing is gonna stop Citizen Verdict from bringing justice to the American people. [Tyler] Marty? What is this bullshit about a lawsuit? Is Governor Behr trying to kill our show? [Marty] Relax, Bull. He's just playing the press. [Bull laughs] You don't know dick about politics. That man is gonna challenge me for the primaries. Your lawyers are gonna keep me in the loop. I wanna know everything that's going on at every minute. Let's eat. Oh, this is good. Excuse me. Thank you. So... How's the voting go? Well, I can tell you who's gonna win. Ricky Carr is way out ahead in the vote. Of course, it's a... it's celebrity murder. Well, Dolly Hamilton, let's face it, she was an icon. What kind of numbers are we looking at? Four million, maybe five, in Florida -in terms of the viewers. -Listen, Marty... Don't fuck up. This has got to be a good thing for the state of Florida and the United States. Got to be done right. If this young punk walks, if this case doesn't hold I'm gonna look like a wimpy asshole. My neck's on the line just as much as yours is. Everything's covered. I'm counting on you. [Sam coaching football] -[woman] Come on! -[people cheer] -Do you wanna drink, Sarah? -Yeah. -Let's go -Seven-five. -[smacks leg] -[man] Let's go. Come on. Go, guys! [cheering] [man] Go, go, go, go! -Go, Bobby! -[crowd cheering] Yes! That's what I'm talking about. [cheers and applause] Bobby, Bobby, Bobby! Do you live with your dad? -No, I live with my mom. -Okay. I think your dad is such a great teacher. [laughing] I can't believe he's gonna do that show, though. -I think it's excellent. -You do? -That's what I'm talking about. -Sure. Ah, Hail Mary, I'm taking y'all to the bowl. -Daddy! -I don't know what bowl that is, but I'm gonna take you all anyway. Where are you, baby? Hey, sweetie. Are you all right? [kisses] Where's mama? I don't know. You wanna go sailing today? Mr. Patterson, can I talk to you for a minute? Yeah. Don't you need an assistant for the show? Someone to do your research. Anything. I'm, uh, what's you name again? -Carlene. -Carlene! Carlene. I'll tell you what. Let me think about it, huh? Why don't you give me your résumé? -I'll do that. -All right. -Thanks. -Thank you. [melancholic music] [pulling the hand brake] [click] [Carlene] Hey! I thought I told you to send me a résumé. I really wanna do this. [scoffs] -You wanna be a lawyer, huh? -Yeah. Well, have a little respect for your clients, will you? I mean, if you ever show up here again looking like a stripper from Pompano Beach, I'm gonna put your ass right out of here. Are we agreed on that? Okay. All right, come on up. Alright. Memorize that. Apparently every legal procedure there is in a book for trial by television. Mr. Patterson, I'm Mike. Follow me. Bob White is waiting for you. Mr. Patterson. Fabulous to meet you. -Carlene Osway. -Bob White. Welcome to Citizen Verdict. If you follow me to your offices. This is [unintelligible] on the right over here. I've read all your cases by the way. I'm a big fan of yours. I really am. Oh, this is Andre. Andre, how you doing? Got the right helping attitude. [through a mic] You you're off for the rock and one up. [man] Bad, huh? Freedom? [man] Oh, right away. Sam, Mr. Rockman needs to see you right away, sir. [funky music] [Marty on the wire] All right, Sam. This is important. I got a ton of money invested in the show. I got a Governor trying to shut us down, a guy running for president who's been on my case the whole time. So, number one, you never talk to the press. All statements run through me. Got it? I got to keep consistency of message. And, number two, this is show business. I didn't hire you just because you're great attorney. You've got to sell this thing. Alright. Put it down. Out of here. Out. [talk through high speaker] Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to your account. Perfect. I'm on the case. It's always about the money, isn't? I know where you're coming from. I got two ex-wives. They're tapping me for money. Not one would get a fucking job. Jessica, want to meet your opposition? -Sam Patterson, Jessica Landers. -How're you? I studied a lot of your cases in college. Your career used to be very impressive. Well, I've seen you on TV. Very effective. I love how you guys are beating the crap out of each other. But you know what? Save it for the fellas. -Good luck. -Good luck. Good. Come with me, Sam. I'm gonna make you look like a lawyer now. Remember it's show business. Ladies, say "Hi" to Sam Patterson. Okay, we gotta dress him up in a suit. Make him look like a lawyer. What you got? I like that. All right, That'll work. We can work with that. Hmm. The other one over there. The other one. You know what, dive in your own time. Get him another? Yellow tie working with blue shirt. Sam, if you were a woman, I'd fuck you. [funky music] Now you're looking like a TV lawyer, huh? -[Rockman] Judge Halvern, Sam Patterson. -Nice to meet you, Sam -How're you? -Uh, Jessica. Okay, do you jump up? Come on, let's walk. [photographer] That's it. Right. Smile for me, will you? [applause] [photographer 2] Hey, Sam you're just [inaudible] -Sam? -Hey! Put it up for this one. Smile, Sam. -It's all part of a lie. -How are you? How are you? -[man] You look good. -Thank you. Thank you. [Sam] Hey, hey! Get out of there, huh. No questions please. [camera clicks] What's up with the dress? [Carlene] I just wanted to be on TV. [Sam] You are now, honey. -Hey, Sam! -Good, good, good. Marty, I'm sorry. This's my assistant, Carlene. Marty, Carlene. Carlene, this is Marty. -Mr. Rockman. -I'd like to, uh, talk to my star. [unintelligible] [camera clicks] Come on. This is your night, huh? Someone I want you to meet here. I think you're gonna like this. Governor, how're you? I'd like you to meet Sam Patterson. Of course! I knew your father. What do you think of all this, Sam? What do you want me to say? If I'm a law professor, and, and my understanding is, uh, Mr. Patterson is a law professor, uh, and, and well respected as a defense lawyer in his entire career, I'm not sure if taking this gamble uh, [stutters] would be something that I would wanna risk, tarnishing, uh, what I've accomplished all those years. [theme music] [commentator] Congratulations, Florida. Your choice is Ricky Carr, the accused killer of Dolly Hamilton. Tune in on November 12th forCitizen Verdict. [alarm wailing] [keys turning] [heavy door opens] Mr. Carr, I'm Mr. Patterson. This is my assistant, Carlene Osway. Wanna sit down? Where are you from, buddy? -Florida. -How old are you? -Twenty-eight. -Where do you work? -New York. -Where in New York? Starrett City. Do you like baseball? Yeah. I like baseball. So, Carr, you're a prostitute. You got a record the size of Starrett City. And I've examined this case from top to bottom. Should I be here right now? I told my story to the cops a 1000 times. Do you wanna tell me you history? 'Cause that's why we're here. Why don't you tell me how much the TV company's paying you to represent me? I ain't getting paid by you, son. All right, thanks for your time. Mr. Patterson? You wouldn't believe my story if I told you. [melancholic music] [beep] I was just sitting at the bar having a drink. The place is called Chucho's. I always go there on a Friday night. That's when she came in. Dolly Hamilton. She's coming on straight away, you know? Pushy. She puts... She puts a 100 dollars into my... on my dick. She wants me to fuck in the car, like, right now. That's what she wanted. The car was parked right outside the club. And... We drive someplace quiet. She says she wants to fuck tough right there in the car. Wants me to rip her up a bit. You know, and I said that's no big deal, as long as no cops are around. We fuck, and she gives me 300 more. End of story. Then she came back a week later. This, like, happened every week for, like, three weeks maybe, you know? Always in the outfield. Always someplace quiet, dark. And that night... ...we went down to a parking garage. She said she wanted it rough, you know? Blood, pain and that shit. And I'm not into that, yeah? But then she didn't wanna pay. So she takes my hand, and she puts it on the blade and gets me fucking her. And she's getting into it. [sobs] The blade's right up here on her throat. [sobs] [sobs] And then it kind of just went in. [sobs] And then the blood. [sniffs] Just waiting for you there. I was so freaked I just... I just ran fast. [inaudible] [inaudible] Fucked up. I took her necklace too. I wasn't even thinking straight. I just needed the dough and I took the necklace. I didn't even know I had the blade in my hand till I got back to my place. Then it was too late. [beep] [seagulls cawing] No, no, no way. You cannot do this. -He might be innocent and I need time. -Absolutely not. You think I'm gonna give you time to slime up -Dolly Hamilton's character? -Are we talking -about justice here? -Oh, come on, Sam. I am talking about justice. Well, how about talking about some due process of law? Due process? You know that my case is airtight. -If we had the surveillance tape, it'd just be one-- -I don't know what the hell you're you talking about now. No one's talking about tapes. You haven't talked to the cops. You know, this is beginning to sound real goddamn convenient to me. This was not factored into the deal here. Sam, I cannot give you any more time according to the rules. -Marty? -Sam, I'd love to help you. But we're locked into the 12th. I got a network on me a PR machine, not to mention Governor Behr trying to shut the whole thing down. If you need some help, tell me what you need. Oh, shit. Give me some more, huh? This is beginning to hurt. [Sarah] Hi, Dad! Hey, baby. How are you, huh? -Bye, Mom. -Bye, sweetie. Hi, how're you doing? Yeah, I'm alright. I saw you on TV. Quite a PR campaign. Yeah. What are you trying to prove that you haven't already? I-- Who are you trying to impress? Remember to bring Sarah's computer? Don't change the subject. And, please, look at me when you're talking to me. What do you want from me, huh? You wanted a divorce, you got a divorce. You wanted the house, you got the house. -Now what else do you want from me, Mmh? -Sam... You've forgotten who you really are and people who really care for you. You lost me to your career. What do you think your daughter's gonna think when she sees you on that stupid TV show? Please, don't ever question my integrity as a father, Anna, or as a lawyer for that matter. Please, huh? It's beneath you. Anyway, you're gonna do what you want. You always have. Look. My parents want to have a dinner at the house next week for Sarah's birthday. They want you there. That's great. Now that I'm on TV, I get invited for dinner, huh? Yeah, whatever. Bye. [melancholic music] [elevator beep] -Mr. Patterson. -Hey! Thank you for meeting with me, Michael. No problem. Follow me. -So these are the production offices, huh? -That's right. -How long've you worked for her? -Three long years. For low, low wages and lots of abuse. Hello, darling. What did you do for her, Michael? You were a production designer? Production designer, made secretary, housewife. All that. -Yeah. All that stuff, huh? -Yeah. -You know her will? -Oh, yeah. I thought it was kind of hard to miss. -Yeah? -Especially when you work for the bitch. You think she had much of a personal life? No. Cooking, cooking, cooking. You don't think she had any boyfriends? -Boyfriends? Dolly? -Yeah. -I don't think so. -You don't think so? -Or you don't know? -I don't know. And I don't want to know. Okay? I understand. [Landers] So how are you? How am I? Um... [clicks tongue] Well, I... I can't go out of my house. I can't open the front door without a camera in my face, without a, a camera in my, uh, children's faces. So, um... Yeah, uh, that's, uh... -That's how I am... -Yeah. Okay. Um, you know, I know this is a difficult time for you. Um... But, um, I'm gonna have to ask you some... ...questions about Dolly. Um... Personal questions. Dolly was um... You know, she was just herself. She was... she was what everybody is on, on TV. Yeah, sure. Um... The thing is... Um... Something came up in a meeting with the defense attorney. Um... In trial they're gonna try to introduce some... ...terrible things about Dolly. Um... Sexual things. [tense music] What... What kind of sexual things are they talking about? They are alleging that Dolly frequented bars and indulged in sadomasochistic sex with male prostitutes. Ms. Landers, I want you to go out there... ...and make sure that man dies. Television lies. Television, the, the media only gives you half the story, and they'll blow it up, and give you something else. You won't be getting the full truth, so, I'm not gonna rely on what the media say. I need to find out for myself. I need to get the, the information on the case myself, and see what's really going on. Because the media television is just a big-- most of that stuff, whatever is just a big lie anyway. So I, I'm not gonna go with that. There's too much, uh, expansions with the media. Whether it be television, newspapers, radio. Uh, by the time they, they get somebody to trial, they're guilty or they're innocent. We've seen that every day. [lively music] [background chatter] Diet coke. No ice. It's not like this in here every night, is it? -What? -It's like a tomb in here. I know you. You're the hot shot from TV. You a friend of Ricky? Yeah. I know Ricky. -He's a good kid. -No kidding. -Hard worker. -I'll bet. You know Dolly? Maybe. Maybe not. Never is not too good. [chuckles] This will fit your job. You think about that. -[woman] Hi, honey. -Evening, girls. [moans] Hey, mister! You're Sam Patterson? No, maybe I'm Lincoln. So, go on. Oh, she picked me up at the bar one night. When was that? About six months back. We ended up in this dive motel. You had sex with this woman? Yeah, man. We had fucking weird sex. She was into pain. Blood and all kinds of shit. [laughs] She scared the fuck out of me. -You'd say this in court? -Oh, yeah. Yeah. For 25 grand. -Not gonna do that. -Sure you can. I've seen it on TV all the time. A man's life depends on this. You're gonna have to testify. Look, man, I know being on TV means money. If you help me.... -I help you. -You're gonna testify. Or I'm gonna subpoena your ass. I'll nail you to court for the next ten years. Yeah, whatever. If you wanna my help Mister... ...you know where I am. [tense music] [siren blaring] [beeps] -[Carlene] What're you gonna do about this? -Just a second, sweetie. This is daddy. You wanna call me back at the cell phone? -Do you want me to organize-- -Give me a goddamn minute! I'm trying to reach my kid. Honey, this is daddy. Call me back on my cell, please, right? Please, as soon as you can. Carlene, I'm sorry, all right? I'm just tired. -Coffee? -No, thank you. [keyboard clacking] [knock on the door] Come on in. Hey, Sam. How's it going? Lousy. Wanna talk about it? [Sam] This case is going nowhere. [signal glitching] [phone rings] -Yeah. -[Carlene] Sam. He'll testify. You're shooting me. I did it. I convinced him. Well, this was excellent. That's excellent news. Shall I set up a meeting? Good. Good work. Well... -You get back to me on that, right? -Speak to you later. -Good. -[turns off the phone] It looks like we're back in business.

It's crazy. Absolutely wild. ["Take The A Train" by Billy Strayhorn] Here we have the prosecuting attorney, Jessica Landers. And she has with her in the car the victim 's husband, Jack Hamilton.

Can you comment on this? Good luck, Sam! This is Didi Ray, reporting live outside the Citizen Verdictstudios. [chattering] What you think, that trials and executions will make the United States more uncivilized? I don't really think a country like France has anything to teach the United States about a crime rate. But here in Florida we're going to take a stand against the crime rate. And Citizen Verdict is just the tool we need. Bon soir. [chattering] -Marty. -Welcome, Governor. This is it, huh? This is history. America at its finest. [distant cheering] [Citizen Verdict opening music] [chattering] [cheering] Tonight's case is The People versus Ricky Carr. Here comes the defendant, who is accused of the rape and first degree murder of Dolly Hamilton. -Here's how it will go. -The trial will last three hours. After that, you will have one hour to reach your verdict before the lines shut down. When you call, simply follow the automated instructions The accounting firm of Cost Anderson will monitor and certify the voting. A unanimous result is of course not possible. [Tawny] And so the defendant can only be found guilty if more than 75% -of you reach that decision. -Presiding at tonight's trial Judge Thomas A. Halvern. All rise for the honorable Judge Thomas A. Halvern. [judge] Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. Before we begin... ...I ask you to remember that you are watching this trial on television... ...but it is real. A man is on trial for a real crime. It is your solemn duty to observe the proceedings without bias. Each and every one of you, the jury, must watch every moment of this trial and pay close attention to everything you see and hear. Remember... You will be sitting in judgment at the conclusion of this trial. Come on, Judge. Pick it up. I call upon the prosecution to make their opening statement. [Landers] Thank you, your Honor. Dolly Hamilton. [chuckles] Who could forget that smile? Well, she brought America into our home... ...taught us the pleasures of good, plain, American cooking. She wrote books... ...had her own magazine. She was a TV icon. Dolly Hamilton was someone I, [chuckles] oh, we all aspired to be. She was a loving mother... ...a devoted wife. Dolly Hamilton was an ideal... ...for millions of Americans. [vocalizing] [vocalizing] [vocalizing] [vocalizing] You know what? Dolly won't be coming home for Christmas this year. Or next year. Or ever again. Because one night... ...the dream... ...was over. Dolly's life was brutally cut short when Ricky Carr attacked, viciously raped and murdered her. And for what? A necklace. [scoffs] We will show irrefutable DNA and forensic evidence, Ricky Carr's fingerprints on her vehicle, and the murder weapon. Jurors... this is an open and shut case. The prosecution will prove beyond any reasonable doubt that Ricky Carr is guilty of rape, first degree murder, and deserves to be sentenced to death. [background chatter] Well, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I have to congratulate you. Because you're the first. You're the first television jury system in the history of this nation to ever try a case. That's phenomenal. That is an astonishing... ...responsibility. It's an astonishing opportunity. [chuckles] This is exciting. This is exciting. [chuckles] I wanna pose a question to you. Why do we love our children so much? They play, don't they? They experiment. You know, when you bring a kid into the world, you want to be the total manifestation of your hopes... and your values. You live with that inherent obligation and privilege to never fail that child. You never fail that child. I feel that way about democracy. I feel that way about this justice system. This is a phenomenon. This justice system. It's like a child. It's always challenging us. It's always growing. It's always evolving. It's always questioning us. It's demanding the best of us. But we still live with the obligation to never fail that child. You just don't do that. [chuckles] Look. [chuckles] I'm the defense attorney here. If I fail before you, I fail before this nation. But my client, Ricky Dean Carr, has already admitted to the killing of Dolly. He admitted it. It was an accident. [background chatter] It was a tragic accident. I'm sorry. [clicks tongue] Shit. Where is the video? -Here, sir. -Where? Yeah. Could you just... Could you, please, put, put a, a... Where's Dolly? Come on. Get Dolly up there. Where is Dolly? Hello, Dolly. There she is. I want to tell you a story. About seven years ago, I am in the middle of a divorce, I'm sitting in my boat, it's all I have left. I'm watching one of these little televisions, on comes Dolly. Now I wanna tell you something. Dolly represented to me everything at that moment that I was lacking in my life. You know what? Where is that camera that looks like an octopus? Octopus who? Let-- Hey, honey, bring that camera over here, will you? -Put the camera to him. -Get it on her. Put the octopus in her face. Come on, get it up there. Tonight we're gonna listen to testimony... ...that damns this woman, that vilifies that lacerates this face that we all love and adore. [chatter] We have to sit through witnesses. And the state will try to prove that my client, Ricky Carr, raped and murdered Mrs. Hamilton... ...and they'll fail. It was an accident. Thank you. Wow, wow, wow! We were promised some explosive evidence, and it looks like we're going to get it. -What do you think, Jeff? -I think you're right, Tony. This is going to be a really tough case. Obviously a big fight is in the works. Well, the opening statements are complete, and after the break the prosecution will present its case. [Jeff] Stay with us. [chatter] [chatter] [Landers] So, this proves conclusively that the semen samples taken from inside Mrs. Hamilton comes from the defendant. [expert] I consider 1 in 12 billion to be conclusive, yes. Thank you. Defense's witness. [Sam] Well, this certainly sounds conclusive, Mr. Doby. But the DNA proved that it was rape. There was definite trauma present. I'd say rape is a strong possibility. Possibility or certainty? -Possibility. -Possible is not for certain, is it, Mr. Doby? -No. -Thank you. No further questions. Redirect, your Honor. From your experience, how often do these signs of trauma indicate rape? -95% of the time. -[Sam] Objection, your Honor. There's no corroborating proof to back these statistics. -[judge] Ms. Landers. -Withdraw the question. Mr. Doby... ...how long have you been a forensics expert? -Eighteen years. -And when you offer an opinion, as you just did, even if it entails conjecture, -is it based on your experience as a forensic-- -Objection, your Honor. She's just manipulated the previous question. 95% is not good enough. Could be 40. Could be 60. Could be 10. Can you prove me wrong? Your Honor, Mr. Patterson is out of order. -He's using his objection-- -No, you're out of order. ...manipulating this television. And I'll not allow it. -And I'll not stand for it. -Yes. -[Sam] You should know better-- -Enough! Objection sustained. You're both grandstanding and I will not tolerate it. Go on, Ms. Landers. Thank you sir. The prosecution calls Jack Hamilton. Thank you, Mr. Doby. Jay, close up. Tighter two... [buzz] [Landers] Mr. Hamilton, I'm sorry about your loss. America loved your late wife. But I'm gonna have to ask you some difficult questions. Mr. Hamilton... I'm sure you've heard the stories about Dolly circulating in the, shall we say, -trashier end of the press. -[sighs] [Landers] Is it conceivable... at all... ...that there is any truth to these abhorrent rumors? Absolutely not. [sighs] Dolly was the most wonderful woman in the world. -I don't know how I'm gonna live without her. -[Sam] Objection, your Honor. This, this is completely irrelevant. -That piece of shit over there raped my wife-- -[judge] Mr. Hamilton. Please, control yourself. Your Honor, the defense has told us in their opening statement that their case is circumstantial. They have warned the jury that they will try to attack Dolly Hamilton's character. Now I believe in my obligation to present an objective picture. And who better to do it than Dolly Hamilton's husband, who knew and lived with her for 30 years. -Fair is fair, your Honor. -[judge] Objection overruled. Go on. Miss Landers. Thank you, your Honor. Mr. Hamilton, you were telling us about your wife. [clicks tongue and sighs] I, I have just lost my wife. My children have just lost their mother. [sobs] [stutters] Dolly was the finest woman I ever knew. [sniffs and sobs] [sobbing] [Landers] No further questions. -[judge] Mr. Patterson. -No. No further questions, your Honor. [chattering] [Sam] Mr. Turner, how did you meet Mrs. Hamilton? [stutters] Yeah, we, uh... She picked me up in a bar one night. Took me to this, uh, motel nearby. Tell us what occurred, sir. Uh, well, we started to fuck, so then she-- Mr. Turner, you're in a court of law. Now kindly answer the question without profanity. Yeah. Okay, sure. Um... We started to, uh, make love. And then she handed me these cuffs. All that stuff. -What stuff sir? -Wanted me to handcuff her to the bed. Uh... Then she wanted to be burned with cigarettes on her, uh... You know? She was in a... -[crowd shouts] -[Landers] Objection, your Honor. You Honor, this is a valid testimony to corroborate my client's case. My apologies to this court. -[judge] Objection overruled. -Are you sure you want me to say all this shit in court? Now, Mr. Turner, you've been warned. -Continue, sir. -[Turner] Okay. Yeah. So, well then, she, she wanted me to fu-- uh, make love to her. -She wanted it up the ass. -Objection! [judge] I assume you had no time to prepare your witness for this case. Now, kindly do something about it. Or I'll hold your witness in contempt. Basically, what you're saying, Mr. Turner, is that you had sadomasochistic relations with this woman, is that correct, sir? -Sado what? -No further questions. -Ms. Landers. -Your Honor, I will not dignify this witness with a cross examination. There is no proof to back up his story. And so I see no reason why his testimony should be entered into the record. [judge] Very well, Miss Landers, however, Mr. Turner's testimony will stand. [tense music] [unintelligible chatter] Mr. Carr, you've heard the testimony here of Mr. Turner. -Sound familiar? -Yeah. Could you tell the court, in your own words now, how you came to meet... Mrs. Hamilton? Um, I went to this bar, that-- Court will take a short recess. Councils... In my chambers, now. What's going on now? I'll find out. You stay here. [unintelligible chatter] -What the hell is going on here? -I just received the missing surveillance tape. Lieutenant Joe Cook, Tampa PD. How do you do, sir? -[judge] Play it, bailiff. -[Marty] Sorry. [beep] [tense music] No way in hell that's going in. Your Honor, it's unusual. Maybe if-- [cross-talking] We're up in 60 seconds. Make a decision. A human life is at stake here for Christ's sake! Oh yes! Did you take a good look on what that human life did -to Dolly Hamilton? -What the hell that's supposed to prove? -What's that prove? -Shut the fuck up! We got 49 seconds. -What's your decision? -I'm admitting it. -Let's go. -You did the right thing, judge. Well, obviously something very important just happened then. That commercial break was totally unexpected. -Jeff, have you heard anything with the booth? -No, Tony. I haven't. Wait, we're-- we're going back. It seems-- It seems it seems Judge Halvern wants to make a statement. All right. Let's go back to the trial. I have some important instructions for the jury. The court has received new evidence. A video tape quite graphic in nature, which has not been verified. However... ...according to the rules of Citizen Verdict, I have the discretion to admit such a tape. I have reviewed the tape myself, and deemed it important enough to admit it. A word of warning: This tape is very graphic and totally unsuitable for children to watch. Oh, that's it. The kids are going to the house. Aah! Your Honor, I put the strongest objection to your ruling on the official record now. Noted. Ms. Landers. Clerk. Play the tape. [tense music] [tense music continues] Fuck that! -It fucking proves nothing! -[judge] Out. Out. -Out! -Fuck it! -Your fucking asshole. Fuck you! -You get out. -Who do you think you are? -[judge] You cannot-- Get out! Out! Out! Out! Fuck you. Fucking... Suck this. All right. You're my lawyer, man. Fucking help me. Fucking help me! Oh, my gosh. That was horrible. Yes. Words. I, I don't have words. Wait, it seems we're, we're going back. Yes. Yes. We're going back. Ladies and gentlemen... ...Ricky Carr killed Dolly Hamilton. We've presented you with all the forensic evidence. But now you've seen the truth with your own eyes. Ricky Carr viciously attacked and raped Dolly Hamilton. And when he was through, with no regard for her life or her family... ...he slit her throat, ripped off her necklace, and walked away like an animal, stealing her... from her husband... ...her children... ...and an America that loved her. It's that simple. [scoffs] Ricky Carr is guilty as charged. Thank you. [Sam] Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know where to begin. I agreed to take part in Citizen Verdict cause I thought it was a great concept. Great concept. It's a concept. Your Honor... If this tape... ...is even considered as evidence... and brought into this courtroom at this juncture in time, this is an atrocity. This is a travesty. Where this tape comes from? Where it comes from? How bad do you want an execution here? How bad do we want an execution? Because I'm seeing three executions here. We have just been witness to the supposed video execution of Dolly Hamilton. We may yet bear witness to the real execution of my client here, Ricky Dean Carr. But what we're standing witness to now is the execution of a justice system, that has been tried. It has been proven, it has been tested. It has existed in this nation for 200 years. And this... ...this unequivocally eradicates any notion of a verdict of guilty 'cause you leave us no choice but to vote not guilty. This man has not being pushed off some, some, some island. This man is not, not, not being voted out of a dormitory. This man is being voted off the planet. That's not justice. That's just television. That's your legacy. How dare you? How dare we? We vote no. We vote no. We vote no. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the jury, you now have one hour to consider your verdict. Well, Florida, you've heard it loud and clear. You now have one hour to review the evidence and highlights of this trial. -[background chatter] -[Tawny] Once you've made your decision, place your vote. [Jeff] Now there will be a charge of $2.99 to go to trial. A portion of that amount will go to benefit law enforcement and crime prevention here in Florida. [Tawny] Also while you're online, visit our gift shop where you can purchase Citizen Verdict hats, mugs, and other items. Remember, on Citizen Verdict... ...You are the jury. [tense music] Well, America, the official numbers are in from the accounting firm of Cost Anderson. Over nine million people in Florida have cast their vote tonight. That's unbelievable. Those numbers are way above our most optimistic predictions. [strikes the gavel] Will the defendant kindly rise. May I have the verdict. It's nail biting time, Tawny. It certainly is, Jeff. [cheering] [crowd chanting] Guilty! Guilty! [cheering and clapping] Whoo! [tense music] [judge] Ricky Carr... you've been found guilty by a jury of your peers. I hereby sentence you to death by lethal injection. May God have mercy on your soul. [strikes the gavel] [melancholic music] [Tawny] Thank you, America. It's been a privilege bringing you the first live televised trial, where you were the jury. Join us real soon for the next edition of Citizen Verdict. [reporters] Governor! Governor! Governor! Good evening. Good evening. I'm going to be very, very brief. [exhales] This evening, the people of Florida have had an opportunity to participate in our new legal system. Nine million Floridians voted. And a just verdict was reached. -Thank you very much. -[reporters] Governor! Governor! Governor! I was very much in favor of the, the guilty verdict and... And I do support the, the death penalty. I thought the prosecuting attorney a little tight in the drawers, but that's their job. You know? So... Law school. After seeing that video, -there's no question in my mind. -[woman exhales] The tape just popped up basically. I'm looking at the guy as far as innocent at that point. But after looking at the, the video cams, I don't know, it's pretty, it's, I get mixed feelings there. [in foreign accent] And you know what I liked also about the show? The spirit of America. All the flag and the, the eagle on the ground. -Mm-hmm. -That's I like it. People are voting just kinda for kicks. You know, they may not really be thinking about it as deeply as if you're one of 12 people and you know that your vote really will count. I think when it gets to be so many, it's more of a game. Sam Patterson was duped from day one. Uh, I, I thought that, the, uh, you know based on what I saw with the evidence coming in as it did, this evidence that was introduced on the day of trial, which is absurd. Uh, you know, [stutters] that represents the worst in [stutters] in affording the defendant due process. Uh, I'm, I'm horribly disappointed in what I saw tonight. And if this gains momentum, uh, then I think, uh, uh, we're in trouble. [lively music] [Citizen Verdict theme music] [Marty replay] Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to your account. [ex-wife] Sam, you've forgotten who you really are. [Carr replay] You're the lawyer, man. Fuck it up. [judge replay] May God have mercy on your soul. [thud] [seagulls cawing] -[Carr cries] -So you lied about everything? Yeah. [sobs] [sobs] Rockman told me that if I did the show he would help me, he would give me a story. Had a chance to get off. But he told me not to tell you anything, that if I did, I was guaranteed to die. [sobs] Don't you see, man? He fucked us both. He got both of us, man. We gotta fucking get this guy. He's a fucking... [sobs] You get to get me out of here, man. I can't take it anymore. Look at me. I'm fucking hearing voices, man. I didn't mean to kill her. [sobs] I didn't fucking mean to kill her. It's coming from in here. I got get out of here, please. Listen to me, let's fucking get this son of a bitch. I don't know why I killed her. [sobs] I don't know why. Where are you going? I need help, man. -You gotta get me out of here. -You lied! You fucking piece of shit. You lied! You piece of shit! You lied to me! You lied! You fucking piece of shit. You killed her! You killed that woman. Get the fuck away from me. You lied! [tense music] I guess Marty is calling a production meeting now. Yep. Let's go. [Tawny] Thank you for your generosity, Florida. We have had an unbelievable amount of calls. [Jeff] That's right, Tawny. The number of people who have called in to witness this event? Twelve million. [Tawny] Well, America, we'll see you this evening at nine eastern. The execution of Ricky Carr. How are you? I'm good, real good. [Marty] Hey, Sam. Hell of a view. [Sam] This is why I was summoned here? Oh, Sam's angry. What's your problem, Sam? The killer is gonna die. You are one sick man. -I'm a sick man? -Yeah. You're a sick, man. No, no. You defended a sick man, and we gave the people exactly what they wanted. Yeah, I adjusted it up a little bit, made a little bit show biz. But the fact is a killer dies, and we make a ton of money. Grow up. You're a barker. You're a barker at the circus. [scoffs] Take care of yourself. [waves breaking] Televised? Nah. Nah, I don't think it should be televised now. [inhales] Um, I don't know. If you pay for sex, why don't you pay to watch somebody get killed. They're guilty. Get rid of them. Don't let them sit on death row. Waste my money. In Saudi Arabia? Yes we have done the sentence that they cut their head by a sword. I am not spe-- specifically in favor of the death penalty myself. Uh, I do have a, a belief that the only person that is, uh, should [stutters] allowed to take a life is God. I try to put myself in someone else's place, and if a loved one of mine was murdered by someone I would wanna see that person pay. It's got to happen. We need it. I think we need it very much and I'm in love with the death penalty because... ...you know, that put a lot of fear in a lot of people's heart by having that death penalty. Uh, it's clear that the crime rates have not been affected, in the least, by, violent crime rate, by the number of executions that they have somewhere, that, that they provide some sort of deterrence. They do not provide a deterrent. That's a... clear system. That's pretty brutal, man. [chuckles] You know? See somebody die on television. Nobody don't wanna die on television and see all these people, you know? All these people on TV, man, watching somebody die. [Citizen Verdict theme music] This afternoon Ricky Carr was moved from his death row cell to the execution observation area. The prisoner is kept in the observation area, so that he may be watched carefully during his last hours, in order to prevent any attempt at suicide. The execution observation area is where he will have his last meal before being moved and prepped for his execution. And of course you'll be able to watch all of his movements thanks to our carefully placed cameras in the execution area. [unintelligible chatter] [melancholic music] Yes, Florida. Tonight you will see a live execution for the first time ever in the history of television. That's right Tawney. Exactly nine p.m. Eastern Standard time Ricky Carr will be executed by lethal injection. Last night Ricky Carr was served his last meal. We were told he chose steak and chocolate cake. Ricky also had a visit from his parish priest where they reflected on some scripture from The Bible. The images Citizen Verdict is bringing you of the execution are exclusive. No other filming or photography is authorized.

Finally, a lethal dose of a toxic agent, Potassium chloride, will be administered to induce cardiac arrest. The executioner pushes a button which starts an irreversible execution process. He is a veteran of over 30 executions. We can only imagine what is going through Ricky Carr's mind at this moment.

I pray that God will allow us and show us the way back to the foundations that we love and cherish. The future of our children is at stake. Good night, and God bless America. [sad music] Uh, seeing it live, uh, on television the way we did, uh, it didn't bother me any, but I, I'm wondering about, uh, I really think that perhaps it, it's traumatic to a lot of people who may have, uh, voted guilty and paid to watch the execution, but really they couldn't handle it... ...emotionally as, as well as they thought they could. Did I like the execution? There was, just, it was horrible. There was nothing to like, I just was, it was just too real and... I, it really upset me terribly. And it was almost an invasion of his privacy. Even though he-- I thought he was so guilty and so horrible but just the idea of... ...watching him die was just really tragic I thought. -[Marty] Hello. -[Sam] Hey, Marty. -Yeah. -I need you to meet me at the studio right now. Have I interrupted something? Never mind what you're interrupting. It's two o'clock in the fucking morning. Get to the point. What do you want? -You remember what we talked about? -No, I don't remember -what we talked about. -The deal. The deal is I pay you eight million dollars a year, and you do your fucking job. Two hundred and forty million dollars pay per view, Marty. It's a lot of money. I want 25% of the show. And why would I pay that much? -What I know. -Sam, aren't you forgetting something? He's dead. Who's gonna back to your story? I will. And... ...you'll also give me 25%. [Marty] The kids wanna leave the sandbox and go play with the big boys. Don't ever try to play me. Save it, Marty. This is no game. -You need us. -You? You stupid little bitch. I made you. If it wasn't for me, you'd be working in some shitty little court house, earning crap. Lawyers, dime a dozen replace you just like that. No, Marty... you can't. We're the ones that America loves. It's our faces they see in their homes. We argued the case. [whispering] We are the show. You are the show. No! Fuck no! I'm the show. I created this. This was my idea. My vision. This is how we fight crime in America. I thought of this. And it works. It works, doesn't it? Two hundred and forty million dollars? It works. You bullshit lawyers. Ah, this system is what? Justice? It isn't justice. It's a lottery system you got here. It's like a game of chance. You've committed crime in America? The chances are pretty good you won't be caught. You get caught? The chances are pretty good you won't be convicted. And if you're convicted, there's a good chance you don't go to jail. And you go to jail... ...chances are pretty good you're gonna be out of there before the tears dry. You fail. You fail. The American People know that. That's why they love our show. That's why they love Marty Rockman. Now... ...I did play a bit with the evidence. Yes, I messed around a little bit with the trial and I did lie to Ricky Carr. Big fucking deal. He's dead and he deserved to die. He's a killer. And the people wanted him dead. I, Marty Rockman, gave them what they wanted. And that's why they love me. Television. Television. That's God. And I pull the strings. Don't you ever fuck with Marty Rockman. [melancholic music] Well, I suppose that goes for your cops as well. Yeah. Everybody's got a price. Me too. It's all on tape. [door opens] [sighs] [clicks tongue] Marty... [sighs] I told you right from the start. You gotta do this thing right. You didn't do it right. Get him out of here. What? What are you doing? Hey! Bullshit, get the fuck off me. I'm Marty Rockman. Get off me! Get-- get-- This is my temple. My church! Sam, you're a fucker! [cross-talking] And so today Marty Rockman was indicted on several charges of bribery and obstruction of justice. Ironically, he was brought here [cross-talking] ...following his trial on Citizen Verdict. It's just another blow for Rockman whose staggering fall from the limelight began with the announcement from Governor Tyler that brought the show to its end. This is Carol Burke for FSN. As a practitioner, I think that the system works... uh... I think that... from time to time you get judges and prosecutors, who perhaps are... Prosecutors are, who or overzealous and judges who may be a little lax in interpreting the Constitution. Uh... Uh... But, all in all, based on what I see in my everyday work, I believe the system works. You don't take a soap company, to create a soap opera. But the people who wrote the Constitution of the United States fled persecution. It wasn't a soap opera. They were fighting for their fundamental belief systems, their fundamental belief systems. Justice is not a commodity. It can't be negotiated. It can't be merchandised. And you to stand here right now and allow this appetite of ours for new technologies, for ratings, for numbers. We allow that appetite to consume our fundamental belief systems... ...our individual liberties... ...our freedoms. And you know what? I'd rather you all go out right now become missionaries. I mean it. Become missionaries. Because I want you to believe. I want you to believe. I want you to believe in this Constitution. I want you to believe in this democracy. I want you to believe in yourselves. Believe in yourselves. People, today... ...you're about to take an oath. An oath is something sacred. If you'd all just oblige me now to stand. I do solemnly swear. [students] I do solemnly swear. To support the Constitution of the United States of America. That I'll support the Constitution of the United States of America. And to support the Constitution of the state of Florida. And the Constitution of the state of Florida. [Sam] That I'll maintain the respect to the courts of justice. That I'll maintain the respect to the courts of justice. [Sam] And judicial offices. [students] And judicial offices. So help me God. [students] So help me God.
