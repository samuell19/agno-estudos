(dramatic music) (bells chiming) (dramatic music continues) (indistinct conversation) (phone rings) (woman screams) (thuds) (glass breaks) (woman screams) (glass breaks) (dramatic music) (police sirens) Man: All right, stand back, stand back. Hey, hey. Until somebody tells me you're on this case, Lazaro, you touch nothing. Okay, you're the first to know I'm on this case and not only that, I'm running it. -Who says? -Nadino says I'm on the case, I say I'm running it. I'm not happy about this either, Gresham, but that's the way it is. Relax. Oh boy. We'll see about this. (helicopter noise) It's just like you, Colton, to step all over your prize evidence. Pick this rose up and match it against the others. Go over it good for fiber, hairs, skin, anything and everything. -What are you doin' here? -Nadino sent me. It's my case now, Colton. The hell it is. I got this under control. She's number four. Four women thrown out of their high rise windows doesn't sound like much is under control. -Man: Colton. -Colton: Yeah. Man: A 14 carat white gold charm bracelet. Sells at $120 at Tiffany's, popular item, can't trace the buyer. Just like the rose, it's a signature. Keep it from the press. This isn't gonna work. Man: It doesn't have to. I always liked working alone. (siren wails) I just think it's important to be prepared. I mean, there are creeps everywhere, Meg, and it's just a matter of time before, you know. (police radio chatter) Can't even say it. All these police and it's still too late. Be a joke if it weren't so sad. That's why I enrolled in a self-defense class. But I have a feeling we're on our own in this one. Betsy: Nine stories. I just can't imagine what that'd be like. (police radio chatter) Wonder if she screamed. Betsy: What? Nothing. (suspenseful music) Evening, Mrs. Stringer. -Off to your poetry class? -Yes, my dear. Food for the soul. (laughs) -Good night, Meg. -Good night. (Meg screams) Who's there? Stay away from me. I have a gun, I mean it, get back. Meg, Meg, whoa, whoa, whoa. It's me, it's me, it's Greg. (both panting) Greg, what are you doing here? I let myself in. I fell asleep waiting for you. -Are you okay? -I could've killed you. Look, you're not supposed to be here. I know, I'm sorry. I should have called, I'm sorry. Greg, we are not together anymore. You can't just come over here whenever you feel like. You shouldn't even have that key anymore. You're right, I'm sorry, it was the wrong thing to do. Look, I want us to be friends, but we've been through this. I miss you. Don't make this harder than it has to be. I don't wanna have to ask you to leave. (indistinct chatter) Yeah, here it is. Henry Sadowski. Lives over on West 70th. Guess he went out with her for a while until she dumped him for some other guy. Friend seems pretty weird. A real piece of work. What's this old boyfriend got to do with this? Are we to believe that he was involved with the other three as well? -It's a lead. -Yeah? Well, I suppose you've got something better, right? Is that what you're tryin' to say to me? -Frank: Yeah. -Excuse me for interrupting. The city would appreciate if the two of you would temporarily shelve your personalities and prioritize this case. I talked to the chief. Let me straighten this out for you. You're both on the case. Colton: Listen, sir, I really don't think-- Colton, your star shines bright since the Bontalier Raid, but you're new to homicide. This case is ugly. Hey, if I'm the designated fall guy, why don't I go this alone, sir? Was I wrong? What happened with the Sunrise Strangler is not that far behind you. I know that no matter what happens, Colton won't fold. What he lacks an experience, he makes it for in stability. Between the two of you, you make a hell of a cop. That'd be all. You're dismissed. Woman on TV: The city sleeps with an open eye, perhaps more vigilant than ever, for on this evening, we must report yet another in the seemingly endless string of serial murders. Another young woman, the fourth, has been hurled out of her high rise apartment, plummeting into the night to a horrible death. The police have little to say except that the suspect picks only blonde women and throws them out of windows of high rises. Other than these few facts, the police are keeping a tight lid on information available to us. Announcer: Police have secured the area. Gruesome serial killing has taken place. (dramatic music) (upbeat music) Hello. You look unhappy. I don't know if you're always unhappy, but you look unhappy tonight. You came here to cheer up, but you never come to these kinds of places. I can tell by the way you are gripping the wineglass. Look like you riding on a subway. Well, there you are all glum and it just seems so pointless. All these happy people to the left of you, to the right of you. Happy, happy, happy people everywhere, but nobody knows you're there. But you did. Yes, that's because I'm unhappy, too, just like you. Sad but true. We're meant for each other. Who are you? I am Paul. What are you? A miserable person. I'm Meg. Both: Another miserable person. And you're restless, aren't you? Aren't you? Well, I have the perfect antidote, adventure. Paul: Hello, Room Service. I'd like to have dessert sent up to room 785, please. We'll have one from creme brulee, piece of chocolate cake. With vanilla ice cream. With vanilla ice cream, and two cappuccinos. Oh, and do me a favor, could you just leave it outside the door please? We don't wish to be disturbed. Thank you. (gentle music) (knocks on door) You're not gonna stiff this guy, are you? Well it's not an adventure if we pay. Excuse me, you dropped 20 bucks. It's yours. (gentle music) This is beautiful. Yeah. Do you think anyone's watching this? Meg: I never knew my father. My mother died when I was young. Paul: I'm sorry. That must've been very hard. Well, who can say they had a perfect childhood? You can say that again. The truth is, I kind of miss being a kid. Come with me. -Where are we going? -Come with me. (Paul grunts) Watch your step. (gentle music) Meg, what are you doing? Meg: Don't worry. I've lived on the edge for so long, I've just about made friends with it. Come down. Meg: When you were a kid, did you dream you could fly? I did. I still do. Paul: Come on, take my hand. (gentle music continues) Don't lie, Henry. Your name is on her speed dial. Sure, I dated Rebecca a couple of months ago. Why did it end? I don't know. She'd seen some jerk inside. It turns out she liked him better I guess. Frank: Henry, Henry. Colton: You ever get violent with her, Henry? Hey, I didn't hurt her. I loved her. We'll call you if we have any further questions. You can go now. ♪ When I give my heart ♪ ♪ It will be completely ♪ ♪ Or I'll never give ♪ ♪ My heart ♪ ♪ Oh, let me give my heart ♪ ♪ And the moment I could feel that ♪ ♪ You feel that way too ♪ ♪ You feel that way too ♪ ♪ When I fall in love ♪ ♪ I'll fall in love with you ♪ ♪ When I fall in love ♪ Well, I would ask you up, but... It's okay. I'm in no hurry. Good. I'm not going anywhere. Goodnight, Meg. Goodnight. (suspenseful music) (door knocks) (suspenseful music continues) Meg, what's with the huge grin? Oh, nothing. You fox. Tell me everything. I want details. (gentle music) (dramatic music) (horn honks) (woman squeals) (man grunts) (man grunting) (audience claps) Good. Good. You see how she kept her head? She tucked, she dropped, and she ran. That's what you wanna do. Run and survive. Anybody else wanna try? Hey, Meg, why don't you try? It could save your life. I'm just here to watch, remember? She's right. Give it a try. I really don't think it's a good idea. Meg, he's not really gonna hurt you. It's just practice. Just try it. Come on, it'll be fun. (Meg grunts) (man grunts) (Meg grunting) (thuds) Meg, Meg. -Meg, Meg, stop, stop. -Stop. -Megs. -Sorry, I'm sorry. Betsy: Meg, he said he was all right. He just didn't expect it. Neither did I. I don't even know why I let you drag me that class in the first place. I can take care of myself. Well, I'm sorry. I just thought a self-defense class would've been a good idea, especially with everything that's going on. Meg: I scared myself. I could've killed him. -You didn't, okay, so. -Meg: So. Announcer: Again, it appears that another young woman has been pushed to her death from her apartment. A tragic even that will only escalate our city's growing sense of outrage and panic. We're looking at a ritual killer, obsessive, doing what he needs to do, reenacting something, some kind of past trauma. (gentle music) You look worried. (Meg laughs) I thought that was you. You need to learn to trust somebody. Come on. Meg. I thought it was you. Greg, what are you doing here? Oh, I'm just going in for a drink. Listen, I'm glad I ran into you. I feel really badly about the other day. The last thing I meant to do was hurt you. -Paul, this is my friend Greg. -Pleased to meet you. Say, did you get that gift I sent you? Look, Meg and I were just gonna go up. Oh, don't rush off. Join me for a drink. Look, it's clear that you two have some things to straighten out. Goodnight, Meg. (Meg sighs) Did I say something wrong? He's really a nice guy, he's just having trouble accepting the fact that we're over. -I'm sorry. -Don't be sorry. He seems like he really cares for you. There's nothing going on between us anymore. I promise. So where do you wanna go? Let's go downtown. See what happens. I'm sure there's a place with people more miserable than us. (gentle cello music) Oh, my pain, my pain, my pain. (gentle cello music) Could we have tried any harder? What more could we have gained? (gentle cello music) (audience claps) I may never read poetry again, ever. She's my neighbor. Mrs. Stringer: There was a young man from Nantucket. (gentle cello music) (upbeat music) You don't have to talk, Colton. He'll come. He will. I saw the matchbook. For the record, I think what happened on the Sunrise Strangler case could've happened to anybody. Okay? -Truce? -Sure. I just think it was luck of the draw. A witnessed died because I missed a beat. It was my case. I missed a beat. From where I sit, I don't think luck has much to do with it. Well, for the record. I don't believe what they said. Believe what you want. Hey, just let my feeble little mind try to put some words together, all right? I don't think you set the witness up as bait. I just don't believe you did. Why? Because... if you planned it, you would have done something other than fall apart. You would have gotten meaner, not weaker. I just think it was bad luck. (upbeat music continues) Bingo. This is all wrong. The whole place is wrong. There's not one blonde in this place. Besides, this is punk. All of our women have been professionals, upscale. (Frank scoffs) (tires squealing) (upbeat music continues) -Light please? -Bartender: Sure. (gentle music) Can I have something to drink, please? Mineral water. Bartender: Okay. (gentle music) Julie: Is yours messy? -Excuse me? -Your divorce. I guess they always. Otherwise, why get a divorce? That's true. Here's to ya, kid. (upbeat music) (gentle music) Frank: Go away. (Frank scoffs) (gentle cello music) Man: My life is but a speck of dust wavering in the wind. You cradle me with your love and keep me safe. Who can say we've sinned? Well, I. Are you always this nervous? Actually I'm just distracted. Well, maybe I can help. Let's cut to the chase. When we're seasoned veterans, aren't we? Let the new recruits waste their lives, tentative and afraid. Colton: The guy with the blonde, what's he drinking? -Why? -'Cause I wanna know. Look, it's obvious he over 21, okay? Why is nothing easy? Just tell me what he's drinking. Same thing as always, mineral water in a martini glass for himself, a tequila shooter for the lady. I have seen him do it a lot, loosens up the ladies. You seem like the kind of man who seeks balance, a sense of equanimity. I put up a good front. Julie: Why you smilin'? I find myself aroused by good vocabulary. Couple dotes from my veil and I, I thought I could see my whole life ahead of me. For that moment, just that moment, I was part of a perfect myth. I was exquisite to believe like that. However, anyway, sorry. I... God, I ramble on sometimes. No, no, no, no, no. I heard every word. I have to go now. (gentle music) (woman giggles) Huh? I bet you it goes to nine. Damn. (dramatic music) Woman: Henry. (laughs) (dramatic music continues) Woman: Henry. Woman: Henry! (dramatic music continues) Freeze. Frank: Petty theft. Good work, Colton. (Colton sighs) Paul: This is my attempt at poetry. Meg: Paul, this is amazing. I had no idea. (gentle music) This thing's been acting up lately. I'll have to call the super. (gentle music) Meg: Paul. Are you okay? I was thinking about what you said the other night about how you said you made peace with living on the edge, how the fall wouldn't scare you. Maybe it's time I let someone pull me in into something safe. Paul: I make you feel safe. I never thought anything could. (gentle music) Frank: You do the paperwork. All right, so I made a mistake. People make mistakes. You know, it's just bad luck. Frank: Every other word out of your mouth is luck. Well, rumor has it that the Batonar Raid was a lucky accident. Yeah? What'd you hear? That you were in the industrial park picking up a coffee table that your wife had refinished. So what? And Louis Pasteur said chance favors the prepared mind. And the reason you saw the back room was because you wanted to call your wife to tell her there was a big drip on one of the legs. (laughs) I got the commendation. You know, it must be quite a weight on your shoulder to be the smartest guy in every room. All right, now, Colton, afraid it is. Oh. Go ahead and hit it. Go on, hit it. (cabinet slams) (Frank laughs) (suspensful music) (clock ticking) (Frank murmurs) (suspenseful music) Meg: Paul? (suspenseful music) (answering machine beeps) (suspenseful music continues) (answering machine beeps) (answering machine keeps beeping) Greg: Hi, Meg, it's Greg. I'm sorry about earlier. I didn't mean to. How you holding up? If you feel like talking or something, I'm up, okay? Alarm: 10:30 PM. Greg: Meg, it's me again. Look, I really wanna talk to you. I don't care what time it is. When you get home, just give me a call. Alarm: 11:00 PM. Greg: Meg, I'm sick of playing games with you. I hope you're sitting there listening to this. (suspenseful music) Alarm: 11:30 PM. (suspenseful music continues) I'm so sorry. About what? I felt different this time. I thought that you'd be different. I wanted this to work. What are you talking about? I don't understand. I mean, whatever it is, you can tell me, right? (Paul pants) Paul: Where's the bracelet? Bracelet? The bracelet I gave you. She was right about I love you, wasn't she? One of you. Paul, what are you doing? You're scaring me. (suspenseful music) (both grunting) (Meg panting) (door slams) (Meg screams) (suspenseful music continues) (Meg screams) (Meg screams) Meg: No, no. (Meg screams) (suspenseful music) -Man: Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. -(Meg murmurs) Man: It's all right. You've had an accident. You have a concussion. You've been in hospital 24 hours. My name's Dr. Murphy. I'm a neurologist. I'm gonna look after you. (Meg murmurs) I don't know anything about it. I just know that she was happy, or she seemed happy. Dr. Murphy? Yes. Lieutenant Lazaro. -Yes, Lieutenant. -Dr. Murphy. You've gotta talk to me. I have to interview her as soon as possible. She's the only witness I've got. Lieutenant, right now she wouldn't be able to tell you her own name. I mean, she hasn't had an actual skull fracture, but she's got one heck of a concussion, so frankly, it's outta my hands. You're just gonna have to wait. She'd been seeing him for about... two weeks. What's his name? Paul something. What'd he look like? I don't know. He was a handsome guy, I guess. You think you could describe him to a police artist? Maybe, look, I didn't really get a good look at it. Frank: What about you and Meg? We're friends. Sounded like you were pretty upset on her answering machine. Sounded like you wanted more. I was worried about her. Yeah. People do the damnedest things when they're jealous, don't they? I didn't do anything. Who said you did? Where were you last night, Greg? Here in bed. Alone. Can you tell me your name? Meg Crane. Good. Can she remember what happened? Meg, can you remember what happened just before you fell? I... I was at a Halloween party with my friend, Betsy. Okay. That's all for now. You get some rest. Halloween was over three weeks ago. I know, well she has memory loss, okay? It's pretty common in cases like this. You get a severe trauma to the head, things get scrambled and it's stuff in the recent past that doesn't get retrieved. The attack, her ability as a witness? Those events are buried deep inside her mind someplace, but we can't access it. Prognosis? I can't tell you that. I don't know. We don't know that much about memory. We don't know how it's stored, how it's retrieved. Symptoms like this could linger for quite some time and she may never remember. (bells ringing) -Meg: Those are beautiful. -I grew them myself. Not easy when the weather is this cold. Lieutenant Frank Lazara. Can I take you for a walk? Look for another view? If you're up to it, I'd like for us to talk. If it's just the same to you, I think I'd rather be alone. We've got a lot to discuss. First, you being a witness. I don't remember anything. Okay, still, we need your help. Press is clamoring to talk to you and we'd rather that you don't let that happen. The day I take orders from you, Lieutenant, is the day I join the force. I'm just looking for a little cooperation. What does it matter what I think? You're gonna do what you want anyway. Or maybe you need to rest. I'll come back another time. I wish you wouldn't. Did anybody ever teach you that cops are the good guys? What is the matter with you? I'd just like to get things clear. Are you behaving this way because you can't remember, because your head hurts, or because you don't like me? Meg. There's a very, very dangerous man out there and you can help. Okay. (Frank sighs) If you change your mind or your mind changes or however it goes... (Frank sighs) Call me. PA Announcer: Paging Dr. Smith, Dr. Smith to Maternity. Dr. James to Maternity, Dr. James to Maternity. They're called Sterling Silver Roses. Fulling a class of Hybrid Tea or however that is by Gladys Fisher 1957, distributed by Jackson and Perkins. The bud is long and tapered to be sure. Flower is a medium size, about three and a half inches in diameter. They're lavender by day. Then in the moonlight, they look silver. You ever play team sports when you were a kid? -Never. -It shows. Meg Crane isn't leveling with us. Patronize me, oh great one. Please tell me why? Well, she was nasty, put off, caustic, noxious. All because I told her I was a cop. You think she reacted that way 'cause of your profession? I'm gonna find out about that little girl. (phone rings) Homicide, Colton. Yeah. Yeah. Mhmm, okay. I know something you don't. Frank: Hmm? Meg Crane is talking to a reporter at the hospital right now. What the hell have you done? You just may have cost us this case. I don't think it's any of your business. Is this your chance for a little fame? Get out. Excuse me, I'm Tim Colton. We're partners, I'm civilized, he's not. -Can we talk? -No. (Frank sighs) Listen. I think it was very brave of you to try and warn other women. This is a very big case. The police like to believe they control what's fed to the media. Meg: Well, I don't think that's my problem. Who sent you these? I don't know. They came without a card. Now, if you will both please leave. I'm tired. I'll go all the way to Nardino on this. I want this girl under 24 hour surveillance. -Fine, undercover stakeout. -Forget it. I want a uniformed cop with a big gun, plain as day. I'm not taking any chances on this. What are you talking about? What chances? I don't like this. If anybody should know better, it should be you. What are you saying? She's baked? I wanna set her up? Yeah, that's exactly what I'm sayin'. I want her under 24 hour surveillance, plain as day. No foolin' around on this. (woman moans) (indistinct dialogue on TV) (moaning continues) (both panting) -Woman: Are you okay? -Paul: Yeah, I'm fine. Announcer: We take you now to our interview with this very special and lucky young woman who in every sense of the phrase has been plucked from the jaws of death. Meg: I'm doing all right. I still have a headache. The doctors say that will go away in a few days. Announcer: You're a very lucky girl. Isn't this the nightmare everyone worries about? Meg: Yes, I'd have to say it is, but I'm lucky. A terrible thing has happened to me and I'm very lucky to be alive, but I'm talking now because I want women to know how I feel. Announcer: What do you remember? Meg: I don't remember anything. I couldn't even tell you what he looked like. I just know that I loved him and I'm still here. I'm alive. Announcer: Are you afraid he'll come back? Meg:I doubt he will. It's like lightning. Would it strike twice? I doubt it. But if he does, I'll just take it one step at a time. Announcer: what is your next step? Meg: I'm going home. That apartment is my home, and he's not gonna take it away from me. (suspenseful music) You're crazy for coming back here. I'm crazy for a lot of things. -So good to have you back. -Meg: It's good to be back. (gentle music) (man panting and grunting) (grunts heavily) (punching noises) (punching and grunting continue) Betsy: Why don't you come and stay with me? Meg: Betsy, go, I'll be fine. -Are you sure? -Yes. Meg: I'll call you tomorrow. -Betsy: Promise? -Meg:Yes, I promise. -Now go. Okay. -Okay, call me. (gentle music) If she's hiding something, she's doin' a hell of a job. There's nothing on this woman. Tax returns, school, work history. She's as run of the mills as it comes. Nothing stands out. Clean and boring. She's being guarded. Not well enough. And we should pack her up and take her outta state. Nope. There's more to her than we know. She wants this. She's ready for it. Clean and boring Meg Crane. Who are you? (suspenseful music) Man: Can I help you? Sometimes it gets stuck a little. Works every time. -Thank you. -Man: Pleasure. (suspenseful music) Just keep checking on her for me, okay? What do you got? I'll talk to you later. Well, her real name isn't Meg Crane. It's Norma Markham. Yeah, what else? Says here her father died when she was two, mother died when she was nine. Doesn't say anything about foster care. Look at that. She's got life insurance and one beneficiary. The Children's Defense League. That's weird, isn't it? 23 year old with life insurance. Well, the more we know about her, the closer we get to him. Yes? Did I tell you about the most gorgeous guy that's up in men's ware right now? -No. -His name is Nick and I know, I just-- I can't control myself. It's like clockwork. Every time I see him stacking those jockey shorts, I just go out of my mind. I don't know. Do you think I should reprioritize my social life? Betsy, do I know that guy back there? The one in the blue. Betsy: Well if you do, why haven't you introduced me? He's cute and I'm fickle. He lives below me. Yeah, I saw him the other day. Feels like I know him. (suspenseful music) Tell everyone is said hi. All right and be careful. Watch her. Bet you can't keep up with me. (upbeat music) (police officer panting) (suspenseful music) This thing's been acting up lately. We'll have to call the super. Eric, Eric Overden. I just moved into 8C. 8C? Isn't that where Mrs. Stringer lives? Yes, that's right. I'm her nephew. She actually just moved to San Francisco. Really? Yeah, Ferlinghetti Ginsburg. These voices beckon. I suspect she's browsing through city lights as we speak. I didn't get a chance to say goodbye. Paul: I can send your regards. Okay, thanks. It's funny how it worked out. She was in such a hurry to leave. I was looking for a place. It worked out perfectly. I had no idea. Take this. I'm sure she would have wanted you to have it. Robert Frost. You like poetry? I bet you do. Yes, I do. How did you know? Not the most relaxing ride. I get the strangest feeling like we've met someplace before. I was thinking the same thing. Maybe it was another life. -Take care. -All right. (Paul hums) (suspensful music) Wow, you look good. Thank you, I'm feeling good. They said I could take another week, but it's already been three and I'm starting to go stir crazy. Well, we've all missed you. Hope I remember how to do my job. That's assuming there was something to remember -in the first place. -(Meg laughs) -That's not very nice. -That was a joke. Meg on TV: I'm lucky, terrible things happened to me. I'm very lucky to be alive. I'm going home. That apartment is my home and he's not gonna take it away from me. I doubt he will. It's like lightning. Would it strike twice? I'm determined to live my life. I refuse to live in fear. So I guess I'm just mad. I'm going home. I'm alive. I'm going home. That apartment is my home and he's not gonna take it away from me. He would've won if the answer were anything else. I'm still here. I doubt he will. I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive. It's the strangest feeling. I mean, there are times when I feel like I've been there before, but I don't know why or when. With the guy in the corner market the other day, I swear I know him. Well, maybe you just wanna know him. -Maybe. -(Betsy laughs) See that funny brand is not dented. (suspenseful music) Like this. I feel like I've seen this before. This painting. Betsy: Maybe you have. I've seen this. Betsy: You poor person. You're haunted by an ugly painting. Come on. (suspenseful music) (Paul whistles) (suspenseful music continues) Aw, "The Road Not Taken," by Robert Frost. Do you mind if I sit down? I'm worried about the road you've chosen. It's gonna cost somebody their life. Maybe your own, Norma Markham. You were a little girl. All of nine years old. You lived alone with your mother and your father died when you were only two. I know that story, Lieutenant. Yeah, but you left me to run around and figure it out, so bear with me. Your mother was followed, harassed by some guy, an ex-lover, maybe, I don't know. Things were different then. Nobody paid much attention to a woman's cries for help. The police couldn't be bothered. Couldn't be bothered? He was one of them. He was a cop. They knew he was bad. They were probably taking bets on what he'd do. It was wrong and there's no excuse for it. Saying that doesn't make any difference. It's a different world now, and I know I've been a nuisance to you, but we need your help. Shoe's on the other foot. Yes it is and I know you want revenge for what happened to your mother, but it's too late. He broke down our door. He raped her and then he killed her and I saw it all. Meg, I know what it is to hang on to something so ugly that it rots you from inside out. Nothing good comes from it. He'll try to kill me again, won't he? (Frank sighs) Yes, I think he will. I hope he tries. I've gone this way before. The price is too much for everybody, but I'm tellin' you, this is different. You've been warned. Even if I wanted to help you, I can't. Yeah. Yeah. (suspenseful music) (door knocks) (door knocks) Who is it? Greg: Meg, it's me, Greg. Could you open the door? Look, I've been worried about you. You haven't returned my phone calls. Look, Greg, I just feel like being alone. Come on, Meg, open up. Meg, don't lock me out like this. You shouldn't be alone after what's happened. Meg. Okay, I'll try and understand. I'll go, Meg, if that's what you want, but if you change your mind, if you wanna talk, I'm here for you. (suspenseful music) (indistinct chatter) (suspenseful music continues) -Paul: Greg? -Yeah. Paul: I'm Eric Overden. I live in Meg's building. That's a lot closer than I'll ever get. Paul: Yeah, I happened to see you -standing outside of the door. -Greg: Oh yeah. You know, I think I know how you feel. She's makin' you crazy, right? Something like that. Sorry, you look really familiar. Have we met? No, I can safely say we've never met. It must be one of those deja vu things. They say it's a chemical in your brain. No, I know you. I remember. You used to have glasses, right? Yeah, I saw you and Meg the other night. -You and Meg were outside-- -It wasn't me. Believe me, I wish it was. Yeah, but it wasn't me. You want a drink? If you're buyin', I'm drinkin'. Good. Bartender. (elevator dings) -Out for your morning jog I see. -(Meg chuckles) Guess the clothes give it away. You're like clockwork. Every morning, 8:30 on the dot. So how's the recovery going? Good. There are advantages to having a thick skull. Guess you're right. I work at home, so if you ever feel like company. -Yeah. -Don't be shy, okay? Okay. -Paul: Bye. -Bye. Nice shoes. I'm ready for you, Ms. Crane. (dramatic music) Man: Got anything, Tony? Can we relax now? Found some newspaper clippings about the killings. Some victim's photos, couple of matchbooks, and the bars he picked them up in. Looks like it's all here. Good, this is good 'cause you guys were having a hard time making it stick with him. At least he ended it before anyone else got hurt. Man: Sir. (Colton sighs) You don't look so happy. My mental illness prevents me from crying out in ecstasy. You know what I mean. He left no note. I don't buy it. I don't think this guy killed anybody, including himself. (bells jingling) What can I do for you, Lieutenant? There's been a new development in the case. I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but Greg March committed suicide this morning. What? It appears from the evidence we found in his apartment that he was the killer. No, that doesn't make any sense. I'm curious. Why doesn't it? Because he was just a sweet... mixed up guy. Is that just a feeling you have? Nothing you might wanna talk about? No. Nothing else to say? It would be a pity if Greg March went to his grave a serial killer, especially if you knew different. If something comes to me, I'll let you know. Oh, I've been ordered to pull your 24 hour protection. Is there any reason why I shouldn't? No. I'm sorry about your friend. Meg. Be careful. (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music intensifies) (door knocks) Hello. Hi, I hope I'm not bothering you. No, no, not at all. I'd invite you in, but I'm ashamed to my housekeeping. (Meg chuckles) Well, that's okay, I'm unannounced. Pretty cliched, isn't it? The slob bachelor thing. Well, actually I went out with a guy once who let the globs of toothpaste buildup so much on his bathroom sink, it sorta looked like a mound. You're a very forgiving person. (Meg chuckles) Actually, I left him. See, I'm right not to let you in. (Meg chuckles) Look, I'm going a little stir crazy today and I was wondering if you'd wanna go out tonight. Out, like a date out? Yeah, like a date. (suspenseful music) You seem sad. I'm sorry. No, I just got some bad new today, but I'm fine. -Do you read restaurant reviews? -Paul: No. Well, picky write them, but there is a place on East End that got an A+. (suspenseful music continues) Oh, I ate too much. I think I injured something. -Me too. -(Meg laughs) I think that guy gave that place an A because it stands for ambulance. I found this the other day. What do you think? Doesn't do much for me. Why, you like it? I don't know. I get this strange feeling that I've seen it before. It should mean something to me. Well, it's probably famous. You might have seen it in a photo. I don't think so. It's freezing. Let's go. (suspenseful music) I had a wonderful time tonight. Me too. I don't want it to end. It doesn't have to. Come here. I have a surprise for you. (suspenseful music continues) I want you. Why me? Because I think you might be different. Colton: Can't believe you're just gonna pack up like this is over. This case is officially closed, okay? No, you know, it's not okay. I mean, it's obvious we're missing something. Well maybe you're just wrong. Maybe old Greg the serial killer just strung himself up because he couldn't live with himself anymore. I don't know. No. When it comes to your brain, you're the most arrogant son of a I've ever met. You know you're right and you know this case isn't over and you're just givin' up 'cause you're scared. (suspenseful music) I can't think of a more perfect way to celebrate. Celebrate what? They found him. The killer. I'm free. Really? Come with me. (suspenseful music) (Paul breathing heavily) Meg whispers: I have an idea. Paul: This isn't the way it was supposed to be. How was it supposed to be, Eric? (Paul panting) (Paul screams) Man: I have called the station three times and there doesn't seem to be a way to get anybody's attention. I'd like to report a missing person. Fill that out. Has to be gone at least 72 hours. You act like this is f no consequence. Where is the humanity? All right, all right. What's her name? Mrs. Eugene Stringer. She attends a poetry recital every week. Last week she missed a retrospective of Robert Frost. Officer: So what? Robert Frost was her favorite poet. She was passionate about his work. It wasn't something she would miss. Robert Frost. What was the name again? Mrs. Stringer. Mrs. Eugene Stringer. What was her address? Oh, I'm not sure. I believe she lived on the East Side. (Frank murmuring) Meg: Hello, Paul. Welcome back. I know you must be feeling a little anxious now. Relax, it'll be over soon. Now it's your turn. You knew all along. I was wrong about one thing. You are different than the others. Frank: Police, open up. I want you to know how it feels, Paul, falling through space, the whole world is spinning while you count the seconds. You can't shoot me. It's not that easy to kill someone, especially someone you love. I know you love me. I see it in your eyes. I felt it when we kissed. A part of me still knows how to love. -I felt that for you. -Don't move. You wanna heal, don't you, Meg? You wanna be whole. Isn't that what drives us both? If you pull that trigger, there's no turning back. -(Paul grunts) -(Meg pants) Now you're making this very difficult. (door slams) Hold it right there. Put it down. Put it down. All right, turn around. Turn around. Hands in the air, now. Paul: No. Oh, no, no. Come on. (Meg screams) No. (Paul grunts) No, no. (Meg screams) (both grunting) No, no. (both grunting) (Meg pants) Meg. Are you all right? Just gotta hand it to you. If it weren't for you, Meg would be... I think you're a really good cop. Maybe I'm just a little jealous. (Frank laughs) Oh, Colton. Meg Crane isn't alive because my IQ's off the charts. She's alive because my partner wouldn't settle for anything less. Not to mention a little luck. Well, it's over. I'm beginning to believe in second chances. What do you say, kid? It's not that easy. I fell in love with a man and he turned on me. Sometimes it's hard to see the danger of things until it's too late. I speak from experience. (Meg sighs) I just wanna leave it behind me. Move forward. Good idea.
