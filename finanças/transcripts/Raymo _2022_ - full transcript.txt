Hello, Signal PC. Come in. A red colour Maserati is over speeding and has jumped the signal. Looks suspicious. Arrest him. Block the car. He's driving like a maniac! Hey! - What is this? Who is that? Watch out, you idiot! Hey you! Stop! Stop! Who the hell is he? Stop the car! How dare you drive so recklessly! Come here. Madam, we have traced the car. He was the one behind the wheel! So what makes you drive like a maniac? Hey! Lower the pane! Hey! Lower the pane! I'm talking to you! Lower it! Don't stand there. - Did you see how fast he went? Turn off the damn music! Did you see him drive? Who the hell are you? Do you own the roads in the city? Exactly. Whichever road I drive on, it becomes mine. Spare me these film dialogues. Are you drunk? Although you don't smell like it. Which brand? Frankly, I was fine until I lowered the window and witnessed your beauty. The moment I saw you, I felt intoxicated. Hey Lady sub-inspector... Why haven't you yet participated in the miss world being such a damsel?! Hmm! Wow! Flirting with a cop, huh? Flirt? So you mean to say you're not pretty? Now you drive home carefully, okay. After meeting you, I feel like doing exactly that. Hey lady sub inspector, I love you. Raymo! Raymo! Raymo! Raymo! Raymo! Raymo! The pressure is mounting. - Raymo! Raymo! Raymo! Hey Hubli! - Greetings sir! Massive crowd out there sir. How do we handle them sir? Looks like a houseful event. Let's be prepared. Arrange two constables backstage. - I have a doubt sir. So many people at this hour. What event is it anyway? Deshpande's son is holding a classical music programme. Is Deshpande from North Karnataka? Happy he's from your home town! You want to benefit from it! No way! No chance! He's a big shot! They wait for weeks for his appointment! Do you even know that? I get it, sir. I'm thinking of meeting him for my next posting, sir. Hey, he's a shining star! You can only admire him from far. Wow! - Wow! I think we made a wise decision by sponsoring this concert. Yeah! - Welcome sir! Hey! I want to meet Raymo man! I have to instruct him to speak well of our brand on stage. He's in the green room right? I'll meet him. I'll talk to him. - We'll meet him. Sir! - I don't even if he's going to come. How do I tell them? Darling! Oh no! My husband's here! - Darling! Busy cooking, huh? - Take this! I'm coming, wait! Oh god! Go! - What's cooking, darling? Darling! - Please go! Open the door fast darling! - I beg of you! Go! Look, he escaped! You dumbo! He's escaping. Let's go! - Wait! Idiot, he got away! Let him go guys. What can I do if the lock of my house can be opened with any key! Success! Signal PC, come in. Charlie, there's been an accident on Magadi road. Send the Hoysala team quickly. Also send an ambulance. A red colour Mustang. Arrest him. Block the car. - Always some problem or the other! Won't even let me play in peace. Why was there a sound there when the accident occurred here? Raymo! Raymo! Raymo! Raymo! Raymo! Raymo! Raymo! Raymo! Raymo! Raymo! Raymo! Raymo! "Constant war Absolute quarrel" "Overall blaze is Raymo's fame" "Inclusive of romance Filled with hatred" "Written with love is Raymo's game" "All day, all night" "Always high" "Without flutter Encapsulating" "Through his lips" "Be it sourness Be it spice" "Chewing and gobbling it, is Raymo's fame" "Let him backstab Let him fight" "Not letting them go is Raymo's game" "Salute war" "Win with love" "Grab attention" "Earn salutation" "Patience is unknown Lifeline is not needed" "Won't live under anyone's shelter won't listen to anybody" "Provoke me for a moment" "I'll remember it till the end" "And conquer you" "Will take a drag Will flaunt my ego" "Will down rum That's Raymo's fame" "Smile on the face Hand on the waist" "Raiding the bar is Raymo's fame" You are under arrest! Good morning madam. - Good morning. Has Shri left? - Sir is getting ready Oh god! Good morning darling! - Good morning! So, my regular check-up? - Yeah. Okay. - Is it fine? It's normal. - That will do. Shri, please take a look at the headlines. What the hell is this! I'm happy to see your name on the front page. But not like this! Have you gone crazy? - Sir... They write good things about me too. But you must have the patience to look for it. Sir... If not, you must be large-hearted to see the goodness in everything. You don't possess either. Venkat! - Sir Which a*****e let this fellow in to my room? If you give money without any wrong-doing, it's called charity. If you give money after wrong doings, it's called penalty. - Hey, close that door. That man's shadow is falling on me! And put a board on the door. Dog & dad not allowed! - What did you say? Sir! - Come again! Leave me! I'll kill him! - Sir! Teach him some manners. - I'll talk to him. Well started day! Hey, Nancy! - Sweetheart! My baby! - What are you staring at? Turn this side. - Hey Venkat Sir! Who are all those people? Them? They want to do a show with you. Then why two lines? Sir actually... the ones on the left, they want you for a show because you're Deshpande's son. Okay. And the ones on the right just two of them. They want you because you're talented, sir. So only two people value my talent? I need to give this more thought. Venkat! - Sir. If that line has to become this line, and this line has to become that line, how long would it take? It will happen, sir. Don't worry, it will. Why are they still here man? Just ask these fans of my father to get out! Okay sir. Please bring the other two in with full honour. - Okay, sir. Let me put on my undies by then! He can't meet you. Please leave. Yogi. Ambience is too good! - Yeah! Hey, welcome! - Hello. Please take a seat. - Have a drink. No thanks, sir. We are biggest fans of you, sir. - Thank you! Sir, we are basically from foreign country. We want Kannadigas abroad to listen to your music. So please do a show for us, sir. - Sure! Venkat. - Sir. Give them a 15% discount. For the first time, someone's organising a show for us abroad. Sure sir. - Sir, but we have a suggestion. Tell me. We are very open. And transparent. No hide & seek here. So no curtains in my office! Yes, we witnessed it all, sir. You peeping tom! Did you like it? I mean, the office! - Yes sir, it's lovely. You had some suggestion for me? Actually a female voice is missing in your band, sir. Which idiot said that? Baby! Come! Yeah, give me a drag! Baby, sing a song na? Song? - Yeah. "Tsamina mina... Eh, eh! Waka waka... Eh, eh!" "Tsamina mina zangalewa... This time for Africa!" How's that! Bye! How was she! - Sir... This is not the voice we want. Classical. Soothing. Must be a Kannada talent. Must be joyful to listen to her. Venkat! - Sir Call for auditions for my band immediately. Only girls, okay? - Okay sir. Hi. I'm Shivani Papanna from Bengaluru. "Why does it feel like you are the one..." Raymo, hi! I can't believe it's you! Seriously! "Father, come here..." "With all my heart..." Kannada is our mother tongue. And I swear on my mother, we don't want Hindi. "O Lord Satya Narayana..." "Love me or hate me, kiss me or kill me..." "O darling, please do something to me." She deserves it! Darling, I'll ensure he cries in front of you! How dare he reject my girl! I'm not crying because he rejected me. I'm crying because I could have done better. Please don't fight with him. - Hey! What are you saying darling! You sing just like... Like that female singer... She... her name is... PT Usha! You sing better than her! Please sing baby. Wow! Wow! Why? Didn't you sing? Wait baby! - Get lost! Where are you going? Dude, PT Usha isn't a singer, but a sprinter. Really? It's okay dude. Like how I didn't know if she was a singer or sprinter, I don't know if he's a rockstar nor have I heard his songs. Dude, he's coming. Stop the car! What's up? All beggars stopping my car and begging? Okay, okay wait. Take it! Take it! Happy? - Hey! What do you think of yourself? Just because you drive a BMW, the rest of us look like beggars to you! Me arriving in a BMW, To you looking like beggars And me being thrashed, how are they even connected? Oh god, my pizza boxes! Wasn't it like ABD's catch! Where the hell are you guys! He's punched my mouth! Come fast! Catch them! Don't spare anyone! - Okay sir! Leave me! Whom are you arresting? I am rockstar Raymo! Shri! Your son has got talent man! - Excuse me. You have a 100 crore turnover in a month, yet you rarely make it to the news! But your son gets involved in silly fights, and creates both nuisance & news! Do something man. Just because he's your first wife's son, you've let him go wayward, is what the talk is. Think about it. Why are you involved in street fights? One more idli. Hari, how many times have I told you not to make south Indian breakfast! Madam, sir asked... - Serve one more idli. Forget all this stupidity & come to office. The talk is that Deshpande has let his first wife's son go wayward. You are calling me to office because of all the talk. Not because you personally felt it. Serve me sambhar. - Listen. You can assume anything. But this is our family prestige. I will not come to the office. Don't test my patience. You will be coming to office from tomorrow. I won't! If I ask you to leave your mistress, will you? Shri! - What did you say? What did you just call her? Shri, are you okay? Get out of my house. - Really? Say that again. Get out of my house I say! Shri! Shri! - Okay. Get out of my house I say! Did you hear what your husband said? Hey you! Park your car on the side! F**k off! My father is such a cheat! Threw me out of the house. And it's all because of those loafers! Those idiots from Singapore! Don't give those a******s any discount! It's their dumb suggestion, of holding a voice hunt that's got me into this mess. Call them up! Actually, that's the least of your father's problems. Mahalakshmi Finance Company which he worked so hard to build, is running under loss. His friends gossiping about you has added to the frustration. You're an MBA gold medallist. And with you, the company... - One second. Did you just mention loss? Your father's company... - F**k my father ya! It's not that. You mentioned something else. Sir, Mahalakshmi Finance Company, is under loss and might wind up. Mahalakshmi Company...? - Yes. Why? - One sec. Sir. Get in. Let's go to office. Office? - Yes! Get in! With deep regrets, we have to wind up this company. And which a*****e says so? - Meanwhile we have to... That Mahalakshmi company will wind up! Me. Your father has been informed. If we declare insolvency, we'll be safe. We have no other option. Who said so? What's the invention team up to? Every month aren't salaries being paid? Still we have got all the goodwill, and the best resources to be a successful company. Look here. This isn't as petty as your silly, stupid fights. We have to run a business. It's not a joke. Shut the f**k up. Switch on. The newly-registered voters of this year, will be the target audience of my plan. According to the data I've gathered, across India, 5,86,51,990. New voters. And amongst them, 3,48,52,100 are boys. The remaining 2,37,99,100 are girls. My business plan is based on them. Amongst the 3.5 crore youth, 15 to 20% aren't serious about life. Like me. So forget about those 50 lakh youth. That leaves us with 3 crore youth. And they all have just one dream. To settle down in life. Hence, to build a house. And that leads to Mahalakshmi Construction Company. Now the remaining 2,40,00,000 girls. Amongst them, live-in relationships... - No! So forget about another 40,00,000 lakh pious girls. So 2 crore girls remain. And every girl has to get married some day. If she has to get married, gold and silver are a must. And that leads to, Mahalakshmi Gold Company. If they are newly-registered voters, they must be 18 years. And they have 5 years to realise their dreams. And for us, those 5 years, are the golden period. Our company bond, will be sold for Rs 1,000, to 5 crore youth. After all, these are times, where they spend Rs 5000 on a friend's birthday party. So, nobody will think twice to invest Rs 1000. Now... just imagine. 1000x5,00,00,000x5 years. How much is that? It shows exponent value, sir. An investment which even the calculator cannot calculate, will be with Mahalakshmi Group. And this investment, should not be parked in a single unit. But must be invested in real estate, gold, shares, mutual funds and other industries. We should make money work for us. In these 5 years, if the real estate we've promised, develops on one side, on the other, gold rates will also sky rocket. With this, our company will not just be about finance, but become Mahalakshmi Group of Companies! And whoever said this company will wind up, they will be the first to buy our shares. As per this business plan, the profits of this company, at least Rs 5000 crore. Only profit. - Wow! Brilliant! What an intelligent idea! - Excuse me! I haven't given any intelligent idea. I just reminded you of the basic rules of financial management. Don't park the funds at one place. And I'm not concerned about any of you. This company has been named after my mother. Her name should never be tarnished. So I stepped in here for the first and last time. Take care. All the best. Shri... Your son has got talent, man. "Saviour of the world..." "Yashodha plays with the saviour of the world" It's the song my mother used to sing... "Saviour of the world..." "Yashodha played with the saviour of the world." "Saviour of the world..." "Yashodha..." "Your son is the saviour of the world." "Your son is the saviour of the world." "A gem amongst kids" Wow! What a voice?! - "and with him played Yashodha!" "A gem amongst kids" "and with him played Yashodha!" Sir! - The foreign show guys wanted a new voice, right? I found her. Sir! Please! - But... There are too many people here. Where are you? - I think... it's a temple. Shankar Math. - You stay right there. I'll inform the cops. I like your voice. "Saviour of the world..." Come on. I know you want! You're such a raw guy! Ah, the car has begun to shake. My life has become an A-rated film! Sir... One moment please, sir. Go. - I'll be back. Come fast. - Okay. What's up Venkat? Embarrassed, huh. No sir! - It's okay, tell me! Nothing at all, sir! Sir, the voice you liked... I've literally kidnapped them! Hey! Superb Venkat! - Thank you sir! You know what? - Tell me sir. Those foreign show guys they're nice people! It's because of their suggestion, that I got thrown out of the house. Now, I don't have to see my father every day. And I also found a new voice. They're sweet folks. Nice people. Please give them a discount. - Sir! You feel the same too, huh? Just do it! Please. Crazy fellow! Hey Raymo! What's up? - Hey, Roxy! Hey! Look who's here! How are you! You know what? You're an extremely lucky girl! Why because... Raymo... this Raymo, liked your voice! Congratulations! Venkat... - Sir! Give the cheque book. - Yes sir. Henceforth, you will be part of our band & sing in Singapore. Take this. A blank cheque. Why the blank stare? You don't have a bank account yet? It's not that. - Then? How do you know I sing? Just because you forcibly bring us here. And give me a blank cheque. You think you can buy talent? And first of all, who are you? Sir... - Let's go dad. They're like kidnappers. Should have complained to the cops actually! It was as if they hit us with chappals, right? Sir, actually... - Venkat! Sir! - Who is she? What does she do? What's her background story? I want all of it. - Okay sir. Right now! - Okay sir! Venkat! Sir? - Come here! Thee tension has made my body heat up. Send Nancy. Sir? - Please send Nancy! Come, even you will do. - No sir. I'll send her. Yeah, that's the only thing remaining now. I'm happy Mohana. - Why dad? Because you didn't let talent bow down to money. That's why. - Oh dad, you're still thinking about it? Frankly, I didn't know he was such a big rockstar. I was Googling the same. Doing small programmes at the temple, I'm able to manage my college fees. That's enough for me dad. Frankly, I'm proud to be your daughter. The task that the government should be doing, is being done by you for our village. You work so hard. The village is proud of my dad! - Excuse me sir. Sir, is calling you. I'm unable to understand this project. Can you please explain? All governments have failed in providing connectivity to our village. Since it's an island, our people face much hardship. They find it hard to send kids to school. Last month, a boat capsized and 6 kids died. So... I've pledged my assets, to build a hanging bridge for our village. This is the proposal. But this is the government's job. If you contact the department, it can be done. Why are you pledging your assets for it, sir? My slippers have worn out doing that, sir. Every government has failed. Some said ask the central government. When I did that, they said ask the state government. Each one has their own agenda. And our lives are affected by this politics! That's why this decision, sir. Sir, hats off to your thinking! Your thinking is rather unique! But, the government will be involved in it. It's public work, so lots of formalities. So, we can't sanction the loan, sir. Please don't get me wrong. I'm sorry. 'For the best singing, first prize goes to Mohana V Rao!' 'Give her a big applause.' - 'You sing like an angel!' 'First prize for hymn singing, Mohana!' 'What a talent!' Dad! You trust me right? You never want me to bow down my head to others. Likewise, you should never lose respect in our village. Your project must happen, dad. Sir, file. - Yeah. Hello... - I'll sing. Okay! Thanks! Sir! The girl has agreed to sing! Hurray! That chap doesn't seem right to me. If we are right, the world will be right too, dad. Music has only earned me applause & honour. But henceforth, To make my father's dreams a reality, I'll earn money, too. Venkat! - Sir! Don't pay her right away. And that's why I'll go. Come! Come! Come! Come! Hey! Oh baby! I just kept dreaming about you last night! Rockstar! - Baby! Love you baby! I missed you. You. Come inside. Sit down. It's okay. I need to talk to you. You weren't called here to talk. But to sing. Terms and conditions? I want my payment. I had some emergency work. - So Mohan... Not Mohan. Mohana, It's a raga in classical music. Oh my god! Even the name is melodious! Okay. So Mohana! The Goddess of Wealth knocks only once. In fact, she did knock on your door recently. But you didn't open it. Now the Goddess has got her visa, and has gone abroad. You meet her there & win her back. Even a small sum will help. - Okay! I'll try. Surely I'll try. Try... trying... trying! Trying... trying! Trying... trying! Trying... - 'What's wrong with him!' Hello...! Okay. I'll take it when we go abroad. Okay. - He's crazy! Preaching to Raymo! Duh! I'll make you sing in Mohana raga! "To listen to your drum play. Don't play it weirdly." "Don't play the drum without the gist of melody." "Don't play it weirdly." "Don't play it weirdly." "Don't play it weirdly." "Don't play it weirdly." Flight tickets? For me? What the f**k! Venkat! Why have you booked flight tickets for me? Don't you know I'm doing a show here? Sir, Mahalakshmi Finance Company holds a talent hunt award annually. Your father insisted you be here this time. - Sir! Are you his secretary or mine? Your's sir! - Then do what I tell you! Not what he asks you to do, idiot! - Sir... Always at the wrong place at the wrong time! Wait! Come again! - Sir, wasn't meant for you. I'm tensed about the award function. Would have been nice to have you sir. Let domestic matters remain at home, sir. Why should it be known outside? Dude, let everyone get to know. All's not well at home. My dad is no better. And I'm not coming because everyone should know this. So tell me who is your boss? That man isn't even aware of his son's talent. How will he recognise the talent of others? My foot! I'm not coming. Let that man go to hell! Cancel the tickets. If you don't cancel, f**k off! Come here chap. Sir... - F**k off, I say! Okay sir. "Our heart is a trench of depths." "The time of resonance has passed." "Fed off with the usual view of blue tinged skies." "Daily a new hue to be pasted upon it." "Find a gist of glee in success." "Only one life live it big." "Don't play it weirdly." "The drum." You know what? You're really good ya! - Thanks. Do you like partying? - No! I don't drink. Partying doesn't mean just drinking. Instead of siting alone and eating veggies, come and eat the same with us! See you at 9 pm. 'That chap doesn't seem right to me.' "Krishna..." "Krishna..." "Krishna..." Should I go for dinner with him today? Give me an answer. 'Don't go.' Hey! Hey, Nancy! - Rockstar! Love you! Where's Mohana? I don't think she's coming. - What? She's not arrived you know. Let's just go. Come! How stupid! Who goes partying in a sari? Just look at her. You hop into the other car. Here. Go on eat. It's pure veg. Because you're vegetarian, I've made a separate kitchen, and cooked exclusively for you. Taste it. It's very nice. - We haven't paid you in cash. The least is to pay you in kind. Mohana... You're looking beautiful! Hey baby! Hey! - Looking good. Come on have this... - What are you doing?! Don't touch me! I said leave me! No. - Come on baby, you look good. Hey, come on. - F**k off man! Hey, come on. Hey! - Hey! You guys are worthless! - What happened, Nancy? Those guys touched my back! What damn? Hey... - Smash you, okay? It's common here. - A man touched a man. No big deal! - What the fuck! Look there... Another girl. - Yeah go get her. Hi Nice food. Hey bro! - Look at her! Wanna join? We'll have fun! She's awesome! Come on, baby. Raymo! Damn it! Nancy! Come here! What! You come with me! Nancy... - Yeah? When those boys touched you, I didn't feel anything. But when they touched Mohana, why did I behave like that? Am I... acting crazy? Raymo, It's nothing. Just come to my room. I'll show you what it is. You're worse than me. Get down. Get down from my car. - What? Please! You come in the other car. - Why so rude? Okay. Bye. "You're mine..." "You're mine..." "I wanna say, you're mine." Nancy... Nancy... Nancy? Happy birthday to you! "Happy birthday to you!" Surprise! - Come on! Come on! Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday..Happy birthday. Many happy returns of the day Mohan! Come on, today's reason to party is Mohana! Let's party! Come on..Come on. Let's rock. At least have some champagne today, Mohana. You know what? Even alcohol can't give you the joy I'm feeling right now. For the first time, I've cut a cake! And someone else has celebrated my birthday with such joy! I feel content. I have a doubt. I've been with him for so many years. And he doesn't know when my birthday is. How does he know yours? What's so special about you? Oh god! I need shots! Rahul, shots! 'You're in love with him.' You're so f*****g funny man! Hey birthday girl! Come on! - Hey, come on. You wanna have a sip? - It's okay. Actually, I want to tell you something. Huh. I didn't think much of you when we first met. But my opinion has changed. I think I'm in love with you. Mohana! So you're just like the other girls! I thought you were different! I had a bet with these guys. That you will propose to me within 3 days. And you did just that! Give me the bet money! You know what? You're the 132nd girl to fall for me! Raymo is exceptional! And to fall in love with a girl like you? No chance! I don't love you. Mohana? Mohana? What is this? This is absolutely ridiculous! I swear! Hey! Which amongst those 3 guitars? Sammy is gay. And you know that. Who else? Raymo? Oh no, Mohana! Do you know anything about Raymo? You think he loves you? You think you're his type? Girls from the city and from a village are very different. He has so many girlfriends. Why you madam? Come on, tell me. Whether you're with him, Or far apart, It won't make any difference to him. Nothing babe! You really think that would be the same? Listen. Honestly, I don't think so. Okay? Do one thing. - It's not about that. Just tell him that you're off to India. And see if he stops you from doing so. Hi. Hey! Good morning. I think today is my last performance. I'll return to India tomorrow. Oh, okay. Venkat will settle your payment when you go back. Tell Nancy your preferred timing for the ticket. She'll arrange it. Get ready for the evening show. Let's rock! Bye. See you buddy. - Bye! Let's catch up. Got that? Now, that's Raymo. Just chill all right? Nancy, please. Book my tickets. Hey... Hey, hey, hey! I hope you're joking. Come on don't take it so harshly, please. Mohana, forget it. Yes, I want to forget it. Hence, I'm going back to India. I was foolish to have all those dreams. It's my fault. It's okay. This will be my last performance. "It's you..." "And only you" "That I think about" "Love" "He has not even an inking about love" "You felt just like a dream" "But despite my heart beckoning you, you never answered." "Love & romance are mere tales." "Love only causes worry." "I'm blind to love" "If the world believes in love" "I only believe in myself" "I'm like thunder, I'm as sharp as lightning" "It's just me!" "It's you" "And only you" "That I think about." "The reason for my smile" "You are the one for me" "The reason for my smile" "You are the one for me" "Like a shadow" "I'll follow you everywhere." "I'll hold your hand forever," "And rest my head on your shoulder," "Melt in your love," "And stay by your side always." "But despite my heart beckoning you, you never answered." "Love & romance are mere tales." "Love only causes worry." "I'm blind to love" "If the world believes in love" "I only believe in myself" "I'm like thunder, I'm as sharp as lightning." "It's you" "And only you" "That I think of" Hey! Hi Do you have to go back? Yes, I have to. I felt it's better to settle your payment here than India. So... So... It was nice meeting you. Happy journey. See you. Bye. "I'm like thunder, I'm as sharp as lightning" "Love & romance are mere tales." "Love only causes worry." "I'm blind to love" "If the world believes in love" "I only believe in myself" "It's you..." "And only you that I think about." "Love... He has not even an inking about love" I didn't know this was love. I've never this with other girls. But I feel it with you, Mohana. Ever since you said you're going back, I haven't slept a wink. Damn! I don't understand why I'm crying. Please Mohana. Don't leave me and go. Let's be like two peas in a pod. Always. I love you. I love you Mohan. No. Mohana. - Love you too. "It's you..." "It's you..." - Wait... "And only you that I think about." What happened? Er... Let's keep all this after marriage? "I've lost myself in you" "I'm happy to have found a treasure called love" "I adore you... you're a rare beauty" "I've made my way into your heart" "I've forgotten my limits, so please lock me in your love." "It's you" "And only you" "That I think of" "Love" "Only love" "Is all I ever need" "You seem like a dream" "And I have come to turn your dream into reality" "Love & romance is priceless" "Love & romance is precious" "Like a cascade of pearls flows our love" "If the world believes in love," "I believe in you" "Even the sky bows down witnessing my love for you." This is a small gift from me. - Hey! Wow! Thanks Mohan. Not Mohan. Mohana. Now on, I'll call you Revanth. And not Raymo, okay? - Okay. Who named you Revanth? Dad or mum? Mum. Had dad named me, I wouldn't have kept it. Why? - I hate my father. After my mother passed away, he put me in a hostel. When I came back for summer holidays, he had married the doctor who treated my mum. My mother's death nor me meant nothing to him. Dad, please take a look at this... - Get lost! Shri! Shri! What happened? Go inside! Shri! Shri! Let's go. Don't want to work here anymore. Nobody like our Mahalakshmi madam. This doctor woman is no good. Poor kid is literally homeless. - She's ruined this home. She's married him for his money. I've worked hard to get here. I've struggled every day. Besides being an MBA gold medallist, I wanted to carve my own identity. Excuse me sir, Did you like my song? - You call this a song? Get lost! They hold a guitar and think they are rockstars. I faced a lot of humiliation. I didn't want any association with my father. So I created opportunities for myself. I proved my talent to everyone. Today I have hordes of fans. Today, I'm a self-made star. How did you develop an interest in music? Does your father like it? No. My mum. From my mom. The classical song you sung, Aadisidalu Yashodhe, I grew up listening to it. My dad has no clue about music. Bloody idiot. He's the villain in my life! If he dies, I won't light his funeral pyre! - You shouldn't say such things. When we get married, we need his approval. And also his blessings. - I don't need his approval. Or his blessings. And why the hell are we talking about him now! Okay, sorry. Once we go back to India, I'll take you to meet my father, okay? Now that's like my girl! From now on, your father will be mine too. Hey! No way! If that happens, we both will become siblings! He will become my father-in-law. I can't wait... To go back to India. I thought my daughter would never take a wrong step. Mohana, please don't get me wrong, He will not keep up your trust. - But dad, he's a good guy... Let's wait until tomorrow when he comes to see me. I was just thinking about you Beautiful weather this morning! And it's raining! They say it's an auspicious sign when you start something new. It's true, right? - Revanth, don't be late. I hope you know where to come. That's where I saw you for the first time. How can I forgot the place? Now somehow impress my father, please! White kurta & neatly-oiled hair. I'll impress him in no time. Okay, see you. "O Yashodha..." "Your son is a saviour" Hello... - Revanth! Your father's had a heart attack! - So what should I do? Call the ambulance, stupid. - Hello, Revanth! Tell me Venkat. - Wait! It's me Bhavana. He wants one glimpse of you. Please for god's sake. Come. I beg of you! Hey, Saravana! - Yes? Where's your boss's room? - That side. Sri... Revanth is here. Revanth. Happy now? You're living the life you dreamt of. Happy? Are you happy... - F**k me! So you called me here to ask this? I wasted 20 minutes for you! And I, came all the way for this worthless tragedy scene. I'm rockstar Raymo you wasted my time! Aye... - Huh! Who the hell is Raymo? You're just Revanth. This life that you're leading, as a rock star, that's a gift from your father! Just like God created a world for our well-being, your father created a world so that you could be happy! Your live concerts, music records, crowds, publicity, foreign shows, everything! One more thing. Even I, who nod my head to everything you say, and all those fans who come to you for a selfie, are hired by your father! Venkat, please don't yell at him. - Sir please! Don't stop me today. I have to say it. No... - With mere drugs, drinks & girls nobody becomes a rockstar! From Revanth to become Raymo is a mere desire! You're not worthy or talented enough to become that. And you're saintly father didn't want you to know, any of this because your happiness was all that mattered to him! Had I had a son like you, I'd have poisoned and killed him for sure. So then... who... who... am I? Venkat... T-this Raymo. This Rockstar Raymo is nothing? - Nothing I say! You're a big zero without your father! I don't care about the money. He should get what he desires. Wait. Shri... "Why did you leave me, Father" - He's no more. "Why did you leave me, Father" "Why did you leave me, Father" "Why did you leave me, Father" "Why did you leave me, Father" "Why did you leave me, Father" "Someone once told me" Didn't I tell you? That he won't keep up your trust. "Parents are their children's shade" "Without you, how will we grow" "Why" - Dad! Dad... please! Dad, please let's wait a little more. "Why did you leave me, Father" - Dad! Dad... - "Why did you leave me, Father" "Why did you leave me, Father" 'Put a board on the door saying "dog & dad not allowed." "Someone once told me" "parents are our shade" "Parents are our shade" - 'He must get what he desires.' "Someone once told me" "parents are our shade" 'Mahalakshmi Group of Companies proprietor' 'Mr Deshpande is no more.' 'The news is out rather late.' 'Mr Deshpande had a health scare yesterday.' 'We have just received confirmation that he's no more.' We've been late in informing you of the death of Sri Deshpande. There are several internal reasons for it. He was suffering from ill health since long. Besides, we didn't want the shareholders to panic. Dad. Now you know why Revanth didn't come. We must be with him at this hour. He needs moral support. 'We're sorry. May his soul rest in peace.' Dad, let's please go. 'In the event Sri Deshpande's death, arises a question.' 'Who will take over Mahalakshmi Group?' 'Will it be his son Revanth or second wife Bhavana?' 'Who will become the owner of 2500 crore rupees?' - Hey, who is that? Hey, auto! Move it. - We're going. No parking here! Who do you want to meet? We wanted to go inside. We're family, too. I've been hearing this line since morning! Leave now. - Security! Be off now. - Security! But listen to me... - Security! They're family. Let them in. Hi. Sorry ma'am. - Come. I want to speak to Revanth. Where is he? Sure. Wait a minute. Hello.. - Is Raymo there? Mohana wants to speak to him. - He's busy with the rituals. I'll ask him to call once he's done. Okay. - What happened? Actually, he's busy with rituals. - Oh, okay. Dad, come. Bhavana, I think it's best you take over the company. Bhavana, you know spoilt Revanth is. Please avoid him. And the girls who are in relationship with him. And some beggars just wait for such opportunities! Exactly. Anybody can stake claim in the property in the name of love. Shall we go? - Dad! I know what my next move is going to be. Dad, wait! Dad... I don't think they know of Revanth and my relationship. You've misunderstood him. This is not the right time to discuss all of this, dad. Please, Revanth is a nice guy. He will never cheat me. Hi. - Hello. Didn't expect to see you here. - Came to offer our condolences. Yes, Sri Deshpande was a big man. And you have the same lofty ideals. But I'm extremely sorry. It's upon Sri's son Revanth's word, that I had to reject your loan. 'One second.' 'The people seated there.' 'Yes. - Reject their loan.' 'Okay.' But don't worry sir. I'll help you with securing a loan elsewhere. This is my contact. Please call me. I'll still go by your word Mohana. Let's wait for Revanth if you wish to. Sir. Mohana had called while you were doing the rituals. I had conveyed that you'll call once you are done. I'm trying to call, but her phone is switched off. 'The number you're calling is switched off.' Let's go to Mohana's house. 'The rent is Rs 10,000.' - Hello, sir. Somebody by the name of Mohana used to live here... They vacated the house this afternoon. They vacated the house today. Something is wrong. - Yes. Everything went wrong. She completely misunderstood the situation. The bank manager told them about you rejecting their loan. No, Mohana will never misunderstand me. You don't know about girls. If the man they love, hurts them even once, it scars them. This change in you will be unacceptable to her. Raymo, I'm going back to the US. - Nancy, why? I liked Raymo. Not Revanth. Listen Raymo Even I didn't believe in love. But today, I don't know. I'm really feeling weird. Don't lose Mohana at any cost. Yes sir. - Get the chopper ready. Sir... - Do you know where Mohana lives? Who Mohana? - Vasudev Rao's house. Oh Mr Rao's house! Come with me. This is the house. Jobless kids! Go home now! Go away, I said. Fine, we're going. - Go. Mohana, please wait! Greetings. I was supposed to meet you at the temple. But... Mohana, please wait. I have to talk to you. I'm aware of all that has happened. You have mistaken me. Nancy has told me everything. I didn't want to lose you. So I came all the way. Doesn't that mean something? That's how much I love you. You said you'd never light your father's funeral pyre. You got our loan rejected, so that I'd come to you. But after seeing you here, I'll only see the good in both situations. And if you hadn't got the loan rejected, We would never have fallen in love. No matter how much you hated your father, you didn't pursue it when he died. And you performed your duty. That shows your humane side. What I couldn't tolerate was only one thing. The talks in your house. Apparently girls only love you for your money. And I don't want to be labelled as one of those girls. Mohana, I have a lot to share about how Revanth became Raymo. Revanth, please! I don't want to hear any of it. Despite your father's demise, you have come all the way for me, I trust you. I love you with all my heart. But... promise me one thing. That you will never chase your father's wealth. For the first time, I'm giving my word to a girl. I'm your Revanth, always. I'll never chase my father's wealth. I promise. Trust me. Look. Our point of view need not be the only one. There can be multiple points of view, too. There may be multiple points of view. But like they say, love is blind. Hello... - Sir, something really urgent. I'm coming. Nancy says love doesn't wait long. But you'll wait for me, right? Yes. He's here. Keep all the legal papers ready. This is the right time, Mr Puranik. Venkat! - Sir. What was so urgent? 'Revanth Deshpande has just landed in his private chopper.' 'Now who will become the' 'chairman of Mahalakshmi Group of Companies is the big question.' I know what I can & can't do. I'm an utter useless fellow. If I become the chairman of Mahalakshmi Companies, the company that was built with such hard work will shut shop in no time. I don't want that to happen. And she is the right person for this. Let her run the company. The illusion created by my father that I'm a rockstar, I'll try and make that a reality, I have no interest in the position or property. Revanth. Nobody is speaking of your interest here. It's your responsibility alone that is being spoken of. This company is your responsibility. It's the proprietor's wife who has more responsibility than his kids. Revanth! I don't know what you think of me. But one thing. I didn't marry your father for his property of riches. I had given your mother Mahalakshmi my word, and for that alone I tolerate all your insults. What wrong have I done? Tell me Revanth! What wrong have I done? I had big dreams of becoming a doctor, but poverty came in the way. For an orphan like me, it was your mother Mahalakshmi who came as a saviour. It was her generosity, that helped me study and become a doctor. When your parents who were godlike to me, met with an accident, I could only save your father. Where is he? - He's fine. I know I won't make it. Please promise me that you'll look after Revanth. Revanth is your responsibility. Promise me. - Madam! Promise me. Madam. Then I became a doctor. But I couldn't save them. But I did keep up my promise. That promise was to marry your father. You think of me as a step mother. For the society, I'm a second wife. The one who has come to loot his money. Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera... Until now, I didn't care about those things. Despite knowing that my life will be ruined if I marry Sri, I agreed because I had to repay your mother. To ensure that Sri's love for you stays intact, I forgot my own dreams of having children. Revanth This isn't to show-off the sacrifices I've made. Your parents have helped many people like me. I'm sharing this with you because that shouldn't stop. My sacrifice is nothing compared to what they've done for me. By the way, I have no faith that you'll become the chairman of this company, But 25% stake holder Mr Puranik has complete faith in you. So Whether you like it or not, From now on, you must run the company. It involves both your mother's name. and your father's hard work. It's up to you to safeguard it. Take this as your mother saying it to you. The new chairman of Mahalakshmi Group of Companies Revanth Deshpande. Give the press note. Announce it. All the best. Congratulations. All the best. Good luck. 'But... promise me one thing.' 'That you will never chase your father's wealth.' 'Breaking news' 'Revanth Deshpande is the new chairman of Mahalakshmi Group.' 'This has led to unrest among share holders.' So... When wealth is involved, love is never a priority. 'Promise me that you'll never chase your father's wealth.' 'For the first time, I'm seriously giving my word to a girl.' 'I'm your Revanth, always.' 'I'll never chase my father's wealth.' 'I promise you.' Gentlemen. Can we be silent for a moment? Thank you. Go ahead Revanth. Hi. Good morning everyone. Amongst 18 board of directors, only one has faith in me. But I promise I'll earn all your trust. Because I'm the son of the trusted Mr Deshpande. Madam, excuse me! Hello! Madam, he's in a meeting. Please wait. Madam please. - Mohana, I wanted to call you... A man who couldn't keep up one promise. I was ready to spend a lifetime with him. Big mistake. Mohana, you've mistaken me. You don't know what situation... - Yes. I misunderstood you. I had assumed you love me! You were saying something about being Mr Deshpande's son? Correct. Absolutely right. Your dad shacked up with a woman and cheated you. And for the sake of wealth, you cheated me. Bloody cheaters. A cheater's son will only become a bigger cheat. Don't talk about my father. He's like god to me. Get out! Get the hell out of here! For the sake of wealth, you're rejecting my love. This name, fame, wealth and riches, I'll earn all of it. Sorry. That was my love. And I'm losing the one I truly loved. I know. But I'm helpless. Because, I want to keep up the faith you all had in my father. And for this company that bears my mother's name. Revanth Deshpande. The president chairman of Mahalakshmi Groups. Reporting. "Go if you must" "Who needs you anyway?" "Our love is now dead." "Never will a tear escape my eye" "in your name" "O broken heart" "Please piece yourself together again" "Add me to the list of those who've suffered in love." Mohana You're making a mistake again. - No dad. I'm correcting it. I'm off to realise your dream, of constructing a bridge for the village. Bye, dad. "O boatman..." "O boatman..." "O boatman..." If you like my song, please share the video... You think by doing you will become a big star? Who the damn she is? - Forget her. I am mohana... Hello! If you like my song, please watch, like and share. "O boatman..." "O boatman..." "O boatman..." "O boatman..." You sang really well, Mohana. There's a pain in your voice. It touches the hearts of listeners. While writing it, I imagined the situation given by the director. But after you sung it, I could feel every word and line I wrote. It was beautiful. Good luck. Long way to go. God bless. - Thank you sir. Hi. I'm Malathi. Mohana? - Yes. I've seen your videos on social media. You're talented. But you lack smartness. - Excuse me? Take this card. I'm into talent management. I'll help you market your talent and become a star. But I charge a bomb. 25%. Wait. Can I really become a star? I'm scared of getting lost amidst the many who're waiting for an opportunity. My father's dreams The challenges I made in a rush When I think of them, it scares me. Listen If you can help me with my career, you can keep all the money I earn. I don't mind. But I have to become a star and to prove a point to him. And live an extravagant life! So yours is a revenge story? This is enough motivation. What you'd need three years to achieve, you can do it in a year's time. But don't let this spark of revenge extinguish. Come on. So what's your story? So I'll keep reminding you. Sir... Why don't you tell Mohana what really happened? She won't believe me. Twice. I've betrayed her trust twice. First when I was Raymo, with regard to the bank manager. The second, that I won't take up my father's position. That she means everything to me. Now even if I tell her the truth, she won't believe me. Let time decide my life. But Venkat. I honestly love her. "There are no colours in my rainbow." "This singleton is now without a companion." "Please don't stop me from reaching my goal." "Even if you do, I'll still rise." "We're all puppets in this game called life." "Nothing goes on as per plan." "Add me to the list of those who've suffered in love." "Add me to the list of those who've suffered in love." "Go if you must." "Who needs you anyway?" "Our love is now dead." Your voice and love for music will fetch you fame, Mohana. Thank you, sir! In this super fast world, registering your voice is as important as scoring a hit song. And you have that voice. You're all okay. Just like All.OK. You have a very versatile voice. And you're capable of singing all kinds of songs. I wish you all the best. Hello sir! - Hello ma'am. Hello sir! - Hi. Please have a seat. So sir, Mohana is here. Mohana, Shyam sir. All music composers have a favourite voice today and that's Mohana. You're joining our organisation. Welcome to Anand audio. - Thank you, sir. "If you get used to being single," "Not answerable to anyone, but myself." "Now I'm on a mission to find myself." "I shall find and embrace myself." "No matter the distance, I'll never turn back." "I've forgotten you, I swear." Revanth. Mr Bhagavat is befitting to our status. So I've fixed your engagement with Reena for the day after. Hope you are... If you're okay with it. That... If you've decided it, then okay. 'Chairman of Mahalakshmi Group of Companies,' 'Revanth Deshpande and Reena Bhagavat' 'got engaged last evening.' 'It was a private event that saw' 'close family and friends in attendance.' 'Mr Revanth Deshpande has been appointed' 'as the chairman of Mahalakshmi Group of Companies.' No matter what the pain, don't make this a habit, please. What's wrong with you? You said it'll make me forget pain. That's enough. Sir... Phone. "Death kills everyone at once." "This kind of loneliness has killed me a million times." "Please look into my eyes just once." "The stars move in a funeral procession across the sky." "There's not a single flower on the path I've travelled." "Why blame anyone else when you didn't trust me?" "Add my name to the list of those who've suffered in love." How many surveys will they do? They do the survey. But will they build the bridge? Come, I've seen enough of this. - Okay. Mohana is known as the proud voice of Karnataka. She signed a huge audio contract with prestigious Mumbai audio company. From now her songs will gain popularity at the national level too. Hello ma'am. Wow! - Congrats! Thank you! - Thank you! Thank you! Doesn't Revanth have the same BMW? - Thank you! Yes. And the same colour, too. - Amazing! "O boatman..." "O boatman..." "O boatman..." "O boatman..." Singing Sensation Mohana, What a massive change in a year! She's become a star isn't it, sir? Hi, superstar! - Hi! I have to discuss an important thing with you. - Okay. Come. I hope they're treating you well. Tell me if they aren't. I'll take them to task, Everything's fine. You wanted to tell me something, right? Ah, that... Your ex-lover Revanth Deshpande. This year too, his company wants to give the 'Talent of the Year' award to you. Here's the invite. I'd have reacted right then. But since it's your personal matter, I thought I'll react after seeing your reaction. I had asked them to get a dustbin to put such worthless stuff. But they just don't listen to me, Malathi. I got your answer! We need to change our business development strategy. We have to use the parked money in a better way. So do one thing. We'll... - Excuse me, sir. Excuse me. Tell me Venkat. Sir, Mohana has rejected our award this year, too. She's developed a massive attitude that she's a star. She's not that kind of girl, Venkat. Mohana! What's wrong with you? Are you going mad? Look at you man! You're going completely out of control! What do you think of yourself? Your job is to do PR. Don't give me advice. Stick on if you want. If not, get lost. Mohana, listen to me. Mohana... Why do you drink in public and create nuisance madam? PC, check on him. And get him to a hospital. Do you know who I am? How should it matter to us who you are? Now I'll show you who we are. Hello, there's been an accident. Seize the vehicle right now. Don't you have sense, madam? Getting drunk and creating nuisance! 'Popular singer Mohana was booked for drunken driving last night.' 'Her inappropriate behaviour is now viral on social media.' 'This has greatly upset her fans.' Look! The number of calls coming in! Can you answer them! 'You can witness her indecent behaviour on your screen' Sir, Mohana isn't at fault, please understand. 'Sir, can you stop this telecast?' "You stab me with a knife and ask if it hurts." "I clench my teeth every time I sing." "Can you see that?" "Let our story come to a close now." 'I'm your Revanth, always.' 'I'll never chase my father's wealth.' 'I promise.' -"With you" "It's not your fault that I trusted you." "And it's because I trusted you, you were able to cheat me." "I'm amongst those who suffered in love." "I'm amongst those who suffered in love." Coming. Uncle... you.. I'm Malathi. Mohana's friend. Mohana? - She's inside. Please come uncle. Please... Oh s**t! Last night we had a meeting with an audio company... Where's Mohana? Uncle, she's sleeping. Please have a seat, I'll wake her up... - I'm her father. Please move! Uncle! Mohana! Dad... When you came to the city for the second time, I thought you'll fulfil my dreams! Let's go home. I don't want you living here! I'm going mad! And I'm not in a condition to speak. I'll ask Malathi to arrange a room for you. Please don't say anything now. - Why not? Why shouldn't I speak! You've ruined our reputation! And you expect me to keep quiet! What reputation? Whose reputation? Talk softly. I'm not deaf. Because I left your village, I am a star today. And am leading this extravagant life! Dad, I want to live a king-size life as a star. And I have to maintain a status that matches Revanth's. It's called revenge. I've enough earned name and fame. I'll earn even more. I'll change my entire lifestyle. And you have no right to question it. I am a self-made star. And your dream is not my goal. I want to become a huge star! That's all. Now please get out of this place! Your dad left this behind. I think he came here to show you this. You know what? I've booked the entire restaurant. Only you and me! Please give me your phone. I'll switch it off. Let's spend time together. Actually, since we got engaged, we've never spoken to each other. But today you have no choice. I'll talk and you'll have to listen! Know what? My dad always drove to school by car. My lifestyle has... - I'm not interested in this marriage. If my step mum asks for my life, I'm ready to give it up. But a marriage is not just about me. I've told you all there is to know. So I request you to cancel the wedding, please. Because I cannot deny anything that my step mum decides. Please... Please try to understand. Hello Mr. Rao. - Why? Hello Mr. Rao. Please... don't. Please get up. Why are you prostrating before me? Get up please. Mr Rao, you're our saviour! The whole village thinks the government is building the bridge, and despite being the reason behind it, you're staying behind the scenes. What? I have no clue about what you're saying. What is the matter? Please come with us Mr Rao. You please come now. Hail Mr Vasudeva Rao! Hail Mr Vasudeva Rao! Hail Mr Vasudeva Rao! Hail Mr Vasudeva Rao! Hail Mr Vasudeva Rao! Hail Mr Vasudeva Rao! Hail Mr Vasudeva Rao! - Stop it please. Bridge construction courtesy Sri Vasudeva Rao. Not me. This is not by me! My daughter. My daughter has got this bridge constructed in my name. She hasn't just fulfilled my dream. But has given life to this entire village. It's not me. It's my daughter! Please perform the puja! What the hell are you doing! Just because you're a star, you're avoiding me? Hey Malathi! Have you gone crazy? Why are you behaving like this? I'm recording. Can you please wait? What has happened any way? - Oh really! I need to know your every move! Please give us 5 minutes. - Okay ma'am. Malathi, what's the matter with you! What's the matter with you! For the sake of villagers, you've spent 3 crore rupees, and built a bridge? And you didn't even give me a clue! Those villagers, have even got your father, to inaugurate the bridge! Look at this! Watch this! 'I have no role in this.' 'The villagers and I had dreamt of having a bridge in our hamlet.' 'My daughter has fulfilled it.' 'With her hard-earned money' 'she got this bridge built with her earnings.' Mohana. - Yes dad. I feel so proud... that you're my daughter. I thought you had lost your way. But you never lost focus of your goal. The villagers don't know how to thank you. Dad... - God bless you dear. There you've got a bridge constructed. And here, your ex lover, Revanth's engagement is broken. I don't know Mohana. The girl apparently called it off. And... his company, since two years, no matter how much I insult them, this year once again, they've selected you for talent of the year award. What is this? What do they mean? What the hell is going on? Oh. So Mohana, Without telling me, you want to patch-up with him? Don't forget! Don't forget what he did to you! Don't let that spark of revenge die! See! Today you are a big star! Why? Because you want to avenge him! Right? Do you get it? Give it. I'll them you're not interested in the award this year, too. Wait. Tell them Mohana will come for the awards. What? After all that's happened? You need... - Don't say anything. Sir, can I speak to you for a minute? Excuse us. Tell me Venkat. Sir, your dream came true! Mohana is coming to receive our award! What? - Yes sir! Are you sure? - 100% sir. Hi Mohan. Hi Mohana! Mohana! Good evening everyone. Like every year, this year too, I shall reveal Mahalakshmi best talent of the year awards is right away. Now let's present the award to Mridanga maestro Murali Joshi. Handing it will be the company's vice present Mr Puranik. I'd like to invite Mr Murali on stage please. The singing sensation star of our state, Mohana is here! Let's welcome her with a round of applause. Wow! What an evening! Two successful people in one event! Now I'd like to call the chairman of the company Mr Revanth Deshpande on stage please. Sir, I've been hosting these awards since five years. Not once had you come for it. But this is the first time he's coming. How do you feel sir? Feels like everything's begun anew. And I think everything will continue to remain new. Wow sir! The awards committee is repeatedly asked one question on social media: why isn't the company recognising Mohana's talent? And that day has finally come. Now let's welcome our nightingale Ms Mohana! Here ma'am. Small world. And time that moves so fast. Like your anchor mentioned. For the past 3 years people have been apparently asking. Why the company hasn't recognised Mohan's talent yet? They did. But I didn't come. But finally, I made it here. But not to accept the award. To reject it. I know! You must be wondering what I'm getting at. Yes, this is TRP material for TV channels. And good gossip for my haters. The man standing next to me, Revanth is my ex boyfriend. I mean, lover. From an extremely innocent girl, if I've become an arrogant superstar, it's due to the stubbornness that I've to be equal in position to him. And why this stubbornness you may ask Having promised to love me sincerely, he forgot his word. He chose to chase his father's wealth and dump me. He taught me that name, fame, property is all that matters in life. And not love. Surprisingly, the love that didn't exist then, seems to be overwhelming now. So, he got a bridge constructed in my father's name in our village. He also called off his engagement. So this too must be a calculated move, right? I mean, now I'm a big star. He probably wants to marry me and convert this into a business? Right. But, not just me. Even my footwear will reject him. That's the position he has in my life today. Malathi. The cost of the bridge you got built: Rs 3 crore. And I'm giving you Rs 4 crore. In this whole game, I had forgotten myself. I had become insensitive and have been rude to my father. Dad... Please forgive me. Your daughter Mohana will be her old self. She will live as per your wishes, dad. Bharath. If my past doesn't bother you, I have no objection in marrying you. My father likes you. And that's reason enough. I hope you're okay with my past. - Of course. No problem. Thank you for accepting my past. So, Our wedding is on the day after tomorrow. And where is it? The same venue where his engagement was held. You guys will be tired airing this news for 2 days. So come and treat yourselves to food at our wedding. You too. Take it. Revanth. It's late. Have you eaten? I'm not hungry. Revanth, what happened today? I heard there was some commotion at the awards. Kindly leave me alone. Please. - Revanth! I'm sorry. Please don't get me wrong as meddling in your personal life. But I wasn't aware of your relationship with that girl. Had I known. I wouldn't have got you engaged to Bhagavat's daughter. Revanth If you're in pain, or any desires, please share them with me. Your happiness is all that matters to your father, mother and me. And if the two of you have broken up because of your engagement, then forgive me. I'm sorry Revanth. For a moment, I felt like I was your birth mother! That's why I decided without asking you. I'm sorry. Revanth... Don't ever think that you're not my mother. You are my mother. Mother... When compared to your love and sacrifice, my matters seem insignificant. Mother... I'm eager to know one thing. If I were to get married, what would you give from our family to the girl I'm tying the knot with? Yes. I'll show you! 'This is a small gift from me.' 'Hey, wow!' Sir... You said it was urgent. This guy's ex is marrying someone else, and he calls me at 4 am for it, is what you're thinking, isn't it Venkat? Yes, but not me. My wife. I know. I'm sorry. - Don't be sir. I can understand your pain. But sir, It's better if you forget Mohana and move on. Isn't it? Venkat I've got a nice idea for business development. What's that sir? - From our company, let's introduce a product. One small pill. To permanently forget. the girl one has loved. Imagine the demand it will have! You must be thinking I've gone mad, right? Frankly, I've gone mad, Venkat. No sir, you're a successful man in life. Successful man in life. If there has to be meaning to life, there must be a wife. And the one who had to be my wife, is marrying someone else. Look at my life! Is this my fault? Or is the fault of time, the circumstances, or that she didn't understand me or me assuming that she'll understand me? What's the problem here? And why did it go wrong? Sir... Venkat... I'm remembering my father a lot today. Venkat... I'm missing him. He built a world around me for my sake. Had he been alive now, he would've ensured Mohana and I were together. When she gets married the day after, this must adorn her neck. She must never know I gave it. She'll kick it right out. - Okay sir. What will you do here alone? Let's go. - Me and alone? Me, my Mohana and her memories, will be together always. "Beautiful are your memories" "It brings a smile on my face" "But it seems to have disappeared" "You're everything to me I can't think of anything else." "You're everything to me. I can't think of anything else." "You're the painting that adorns the sky" "You're the ray of sunshine on a rainy day." "Beyond imagination, that's how much you mean to me." "I can't think of anything else." "You're everything to me. I can't think of anything else." "I forgot my promise." "Like the Silence enveloped me." "I've never felt such pain before" "And you're the reason for it." "I want to share sweet things with you" "But you abandoned me" "The times spent with you are unforgettable and etched in heart" "They keep coming back and haunting me" "Come and save me" "You're everything to me I can't think of anything else" "You're everything to me I can't think of anything else" "Beautiful beautiful are your memories" "It brings a smile on my face" "But it seems to have disappeared" "You're my everything I can't think of anything else." "You're my everything I can't think of anything else." "You're my everything" Greetings to all. - Greetings. I need to speak to you for two minutes. There's no need for anyone to get anxious. I swear I haven't come to stop this wedding. Ever since I was little, I love sweets. And that for me is the highlight of any wedding. Hello! Can you please get to the point? My wedding rituals are on. Whatever you want to say, make it quick. Nothing so important. Just wanted to share the sacrifices made by Revanth for you. To show that he's an ardent lover, he got a bridge built in our village. I agree. But I've literally thrown more money on his face than what he's spent on it. Great! Correct. There are better singers than you, who struggle for opportunities. They go through so much pain. So how come you got the best of opportunities? How did you get all the money, stardom, property, name and fame? Tell me! How did you get it? That too in this competitive world! Despite having good intentions, and working hard, god takes his own time to let us reap its benefit. Yet, your mind is only filled with hate, disgust and ego. And the audacity to insult your own father. Despite all these shortcomings, like a saviour he made you stand tall. Just one man. My son. Revanth. Yes. That's right. Today, you are a star. Super star. Because of my son, Revanth. You don't believe me, right? Malathi! Madam. To fulfil your desire of revenge, my son appointed, a PR for you. Malathi. 'I want you to do me a favour.' 'But this matter must remain between us.' Malathi... Every step! Every opportunity. Every penny that you have earned. All the fame that you have got. Is because of my son Revanth. He is the saviour that created an entire world for you! My son didn't send me here to tell you all this. Pity... To forget the pain of you getting married, he's gone to the place where he first proposed to you. I'm not like my husband and son. Even if it goes into the dustbin, I keep account of it. And here's my son who has made such a huge sacrifice. Everyone should get to know, right? When a sacrifice is made, the one benefiting from it, should also know. Right? For the first time, Revanth called me "Mother." That's why I came here to fulfil the duty of a mother. My Revanth asked me what gift I'd give to the girl he marries. Now I see it on your neck. A 100 girls like you, who are not a patch on him, I'd have set as a match for him. But that idiot loves you. Anyway, it's getting late for your wedding. All the best! Happy married life. In advance. Malathi... If your boss has a conscience or a heart, she might need our company's chartered flight. Arrange for it. - Yes madam. Your decision is right. It's the correct one. Mohana, just like how you are sitting mum, when my father's sacrifice became known to me, I became mute, too. When I got to know that the father whom I hated all my life, created an entire world for me, keeping up his legacy became important for me. I'm sorry. Even today, you're most important. This wealth, fame all of it has happened as per your wish. As per your father's wish, if you had married the boy he's chosen, probably everyone would've been happy. Look there! Come on dance! Yes, look at there. Come on. Dance! Shake it! - Oh god! Can you switch it off! Dance! Dance! Give it here! - Come on, dance! Today I'm wondering why I married you instead of the boy my father chose for me! 'Here we go!' - You and him are annoying me! I made a huge mistake marrying you! You should've married the boy your father chose. Nobody stopped you! Isn't it sweetheart? Really? Please recall what you told me that day. 'Mohana please.' 'Please Mohana.' 'I'll look after you all my life like a princess.' 'I'll never hurt you.' 'Please don't leave me!' 'I won't be able to handle it' 'I love you. Please don't go.' I just tried my luck to see if you will fall for it. You just fell for it. Now I'm wondering why I did all of that! Look at your face! We have a programme to go to. Get ready in 5 minutes. To your programme? I'm not coming. - What? You won't come? "Yashodha plays with the saviour of the world" "plays with the saviour of the world" Look at your mother sweetheart! You should become like her. The investment I've made will return! My father had invested in me, too. But not a rupee was recovered. Every man's life after marriage. The husband must sway to the wife's tunes.
