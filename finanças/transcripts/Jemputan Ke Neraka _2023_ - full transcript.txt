TOKEN OF APPRECIATION FROM DPD WANTED PERSON WANTED PERSON Ma'am. Someone is turning herself in for a murder that she committed. Can you explain to us what happened from the beginning? Help! Help! Professor, what is your opinion about the things that are happening in our society nowadays? What are the reasons for the increase in crime rates, sir? Do you think that the number of psychopaths is increasing? Actually, there are a lot of countries that are facing problems with declination in moral values. Malaysia is no exception. So do you think we should take the DASS test ourselves? We can do this test online through the websites. We can answer the questionnaire to find out about our mental health conditions whether it is normal or not with all the questions provided. Professor, before we continue deeper, let's watch this video clip. Special delivery for my future wife. Thank you, my future husband. Come in. Do you want to eat together? It's okay. I already ate. I've also bought tandoori chicken for you. Tandoori chicken this early in the morning? This is too much. Are you trying to sabotage me? What if my wedding dress won't fit me? I'm at the crime scene where the body of a man was found in an alley near Jalan Tun Ruslan. - According to the identity card found, - Honey, I'm eating. - The victim is - Change the channel. - Ammar Rashidi Bin Sulaiman, - One moment. A 29-year-old man who was found murdered. The police are investigating the motives of the murder. Police don't rule out the possibility of revenge. I know him. The female reporter? No. The murder victim. Are you serious? That murder victim? Do you know him? How did you know him? We were from the same school. Were you close with him? Why don't you call his family and ask about this incident? No, we were not that close. We barely knew each other. We were not close. Let's go, I'll drive you to the office. - It's late. - Can't you see that I'm still eating? Just eat in the office. Next time, if you're in a rush, don't bring me breakfast. Honey, don't you want to pack this and bring it along? There is no need for that. We are late, right? Let's go. Thank you. I'll go inside. Honey. See you later. Good morning, Ms. Ivy. You received an invitation card. -An invitation card? - Yes. -From whom? - I don't know. I was only told to give this to you. Okay. Please set up an appointment with the contractor because I want to replace the art exhibition with digital art. - Okay. - Use this phone. It's faster. All right, Ms. Ivy. "Lisa Henderson." Lisa is getting married? Hello, Mr. Rahman. I'm Kayla from Ivy Gallery. "Lisa Henderson?" - Is she your friend? - Yes. We both attended the same university in Johor Bahru. But I haven't seen her for a long time. That's why I'm surprised to know that she's getting married. Do you know which school she attended? How should I know that? Why? Do you know someone named Lisa Henderson too? No, I'm just asking. Can you go with me? I'm lazy. What's wrong with you? We are getting married soon. What if everyone refuses to attend our wedding? Pity me. I don't even have parents. Or are you actually embarrassed? Well, your future wife is older than you. - What do you want? - Your hand. Don't say that. It's not nice. I'm only asking you to come with me. Hold on. More than three hours? Honey, it's very far. Honey, if you're too lazy to drive, just pull over. I can drive. - I'm just asking. - It seems like you are forced to do this. I don't want you to say that I'm forcing you. All right, I'm sorry. I don't want you to sulk. I'm just asking. Okay? Don't be mad. Promise? I promise. Now, please smile. - I want coffee. - All right. I'll stop by the petrol station. Okay? Okay. Let's go. CAUTION Honey. There's something wrong with the GPS. Maybe there's no connection. Can you check? How do I check it? Can you check if my phone has any connection? It's the same. There's no connection too. Hold on. Let me check the card. "Lorong Tirai Delima, Bukit Suasana." Let's check over there. Lorong Tirai Delima. It's there. Honey. There is nobody here, only two cars. Perhaps the wedding is canceled? Really? I don't think it's canceled. Let's look at the front yard. It's so quiet. It's okay. I'll check over there. Honey! Okay. A little bit higher. You're too fussy. - Can't you just do it? - It's done. It's done? - I just... - Hi. Hi. I'm Ivy. Lisa's friend from university. Are you guys her friends too? Yes, we attended the same school as Lisa. By the way, I'm Sofea. This is Rania and her boyfriend, Adam. - Rania, Adam, and Sofea. - Sofea. I couldn't find Lisa. I came from the front, but I didn't see anyone there. Where are the other guests? - Ivy. - Honey. This is Norman. Norman? Sofea. Adam. Rania. Do you know them? Do you guys know him? Yes, we were all in the same school with Lisa. Honey! Let's eat! Bring them along. Who's that? That's Fiq, my beloved boyfriend. Let's go inside. Fiq is calling us. Let's go. Let's go inside and meet the bride and groom. Let's go. People go to weddings to see the bride and groom. Rania, let's go. It's very quiet. Weird. It's quite beautiful, right? Wait, that means you guys haven't met Lisa yet? Not yet. When Fiq and I arrived, nobody was here. We wanted to make a phone call, but there is no connection here. When we were about to go inside, Adam and Rania arrived. So we just hung out and took a few photos. My boyfriend went inside because he was looking for a toilet. But it's weird, right? There's nobody here. Or maybe she just invited us? As if. Look at the set-up in front. There's even a bridal dais. I don't think we are the only guests. Maybe the others are inside. - That makes sense, right? - Yes. - Honey, let's go inside. - Let's go. Rania, I think the groom, Victor, was in the same school as us. Do you know him? I bet you are happy, right? - What do you mean? - Norman is here. The house is so quiet. It seems like nobody is here. Where is Lisa's family? It's impossible for her to get married without them. Maybe the wedding was canceled? No, it's impossible. Because Fiq called us to eat, right? Fiq! Honey! Yes, dear. Honey. Honey, let's go. - Let's eat at the back. - Eat? - Guys, let's eat. - Let's go. Don't be shy. It's nothing. - What's in the back? - You wouldn't expect what we are going to eat. Believe me. You wouldn't expect it. Stop it. Come on. Look. Special meal for all of us. What are you doing? Where is the homeowner? I haven't met the owner yet. But we are invited to eat. Look. The owner left us a note. So you haven't met anyone else in this house? No. There's no one downstairs. I'm not sure about the upstairs. I didn't go there. I've introduced Rania and Adam to them. But I haven't introduced you yet, right? - This is Norman and… - Ivy. Didn't you know them? Weren't you guys in the same school? No, all of us were schoolmates except for you and Fiq. You met Lisa when you were at the university, right? - But Fiq has never met Lisa. - Yes. We have just known each other for two years. - There is a lot of food. - Let's eat. There are a lot of side dishes. - Rania, what's that? - It's chicken. Honey. It's weird. All of them were your schoolmates. I didn't see any of my friends from university. I'll go upstairs. Why? I want to find my friends upstairs. Maybe they are with Lisa. -Let me go with you. - No. They were your schoolmates. It has been a while. Go talk to them. It's okay. I'll go upstairs. Why is there no connection here? If there's a connection, I can post the photos on Instagram. Norman, why aren't you eating? Never mind, please help yourself first. I'm waiting for Ivy. It's delicious. Honey, there's decorated prawns. I'm lazy to peel them. Lisa? Honey, isn't this your favorite? Too bad I'm on a diet. Make today your cheat day. Lisa? What is this? Honey! - What happened? - What's wrong? - Norman! - Ivy! Ivy! What's wrong? Is this Lisa's dead body? So the finger in the soup… Sofea, call the police. But there's no phone connection here, Fiq. Rania. Whose photo is that? That means this is not Lisa's wedding invitation. I don't think Victor exists either. And I'm sure… Lisa is not the one who invited us here. Norman! Norman! Norman! Norman! Ivy! Let's get out of here! Let's lodge a police report. I don't want to stay here. Let's lodge a police report now! -Where is the car key? - It's here. Hold on! Where is Sofea? Sofea! Sofea! Sofea! Sofea! Sofea! Let's lift Sofea. - My car won't start. - What? Let me borrow your car. Hurry up! Please. Come on! Is it working? Give our car key! Hurry! Here you go! You can use my car. Sofea. Sofea. Sofea, wake up! Come on! What happened? It didn't work too? So do we have to stay in this house? Rania, do you hear me? Of course we have to stay here. It's still raining. We can't start the cars and the house is in the middle of nowhere. What do you expect me to do? Let me know! What do you want me to do? Obviously, Sofea didn't fall on her own. That's right. It's impossible for her to fall by herself. I'm sure the person who invited us here doesn't want us to leave. Then how long should we wait here? Adam, you can get out if you don't want to stay here. Don't make a scene. The problem is, we all know that Sofea didn't fall by herself! Don't you all think that Lisa's murderer is in this house? Maybe waiting for the right time to kill all of us. Hold on. Why are you so confident that the murderer wants to kill us? What is the motive? It doesn't matter. Now, I just want to know, what is your plan? Just wait in the house? Until all of us are dead? Can you think before you speak? Don't you realize that we are surrounded by woods? Do you think that the murderer can't kill us outside? At least I don't want to just wait here! What's your problem? Just get out if you want to! You have legs! Norman, that's enough! Enough! Adam. Maybe you are right. There is a murderer in this house. However, we have to stay here for the time being. At least until the rain stops. I don't want to carry Sofea in the rain. You already know how far it is to get out of this place. Right? After the rain stopped, I'll go out and search for help. That means we have to stay here. But it's okay. Fine. We'll stay here. But I refuse to stay in a house with a corpse. It's done. The body is not in the house anymore. So you guys can stay here, right? I've checked everywhere around the house. No one is here. I've locked all the doors and windows. Adam. Let's go. Please help me lift up Sofea. I… I want to lay her down in the room downstairs. Let's go. Hold on. Who is this girl? I don't know. Do not lie to me. When you guys were bickering just now, it seemed like all of you are hiding something from me. You and your friends. What do you mean? Don't ask me that. I'm clueless too. Wait. Just now, Adam said… He sounds like he's confident that the murderer is watching us. What is the relationship between the murderer and Lisa? What is the relationship between all of you with Lisa and this girl? What did you guys do during your school days? Can you let me know? What are you talking about? Ivy, listen. You are the one who asked me to come here for Lisa's wedding. Yes, we are friends. We were schoolmates. But she didn't invite me, she invited you. I've never met Lisa since we finished school. Hold on. Maybe she invited me because she knows that I'm your fiancée. Look. None of our friends from the university are here. Only your schoolmates are here. Except for me and Fiq. I want to know. I want to know what exactly happened. What did you guys do during your school days? Can you let me know? Tell me, Norman! - Tell me! - I don't know! Honey. You know that the current situation is intense. Everyone is panicking. We don't know why the murderer is doing this. Look, honey. The most important thing to me now is that I'll make sure both of us are safe, okay? I'm sorry, honey. Please stop thinking nonsense. Let's go downstairs, okay? You can let me know after I'm dead like Lisa. Honey! Norman. I'm going to the kitchen. I'll make you coffee if there's any. Honey. I want to apologize because I raised my voice at you. I'm just feeling miserable. Because I don't know why the murderer is doing this. If it's about what happened during our school days, I swear I don't know anything. I'm not close with Lisa. We barely know each other. I don't even know them that much either. Do you trust me? I'll make you coffee. Okay? You don't know us that well? Shut up. Adam. Come here for a second. Rania, just tell me! I want to know! What do you want me to say? I don't understand. Don't lie. Now, tell me. Was Sofea involved? What do you mean? You don't need to pretend. I heard your conversation with Adam just now. Now, answer my question. This girl. What did you guys do to her? I really don't understand what you are saying! Rania! What's wrong? When I passed by the living room, I heard Rania and Adam fighting. They were talking about their school days. You were not their schoolmate, right? No, I only know Norman and Lisa here. Adam told Rania that the murderer wanted to take revenge on everyone in this house. It is all because of this girl. You noticed this photo in the bedroom where we found the body, right? I did. I asked Norman, but he refused to tell me anything. Do you want to know something, Ivy? It turns out that they bullied this girl when they were in school. Wait. So where is she now? I don't know. Adam caught me overhearing their conversation. Then he immediately asked Rania to keep quiet. That's why I asked Rania. I'm not satisfied, Ivy. I want to ask them directly! Fiq! Right now, I want to ask all of you! Who is the girl in this photo? Why did you guys look so scared seeing this photo? What are you guys hiding? I just want to know if Sofea was involved in this matter! Answer me! - Are you all deaf? - Shut up! Damn you! Sofea is unconscious and you want me to shut up? You ask me to shut up? What's wrong with you? Now, answer my question! Ivy. You want to know what happened too, right? Ask your fiancé now. Ask him! Norman. Answer him. Salina. That's her name. She was in the same school as us. She was bullied very badly at school. But it wasn't us. It was Lisa. What made Lisa hate Salina so much? I don't know. It was in school. I told you that I was not close with Lisa. So right now Salina is getting her revenge? Is that why she killed Lisa? Right? Is that why she invited all of us here? I don't know what is happening and who planned all this. What I know is the person doing this is not Salina. Because after she was severely bullied by Lisa, she… committed suicide. Salina! Ivy. Honey. What's wrong? I've told you. I was not involved with the bullying. I didn't do it. Then why have you never told me that? What for? I didn't know that you knew Lisa. When I show you Lisa's wedding card, - you didn't say anything. - It's because I was not sure if she was the same person. Do you think there is only one Lisa Henderson in this world? Be honest with me. Did you not realize at all that Salina was getting bullied? Seriously, I didn't know anything. Do you think I would just ignore it if I knew? All of these were revealed after Salina committed suicide. The whole school wasn't aware that Lisa bullied Salina. Lisa bullied her until she committed suicide. Was there no action at all? Salina's family lodged a police report because when she committed suicide, she left a name list of people who bullied her. A name list? What are you talking about? At first, you said that only Lisa bullied Salina. Suddenly, there is a name list. What's all this? I'm not sure, okay? All I know is that the case was on trial in court. But the judge dismissed the name list as evidence. There was no witness saying that she committed suicide because of bullying. Even Lisa's charge was dropped. The court hereby finds the defendant not guilty. Liar! My daughter is dead because of her! Can anyone help me? Help! Help me! I… My daughter died because of her. Please help. Okay, it's fine. I accept that all of this is happening because of Salina's grudge. Fine. Lisa is already dead. But why am I here? Why do I have to be here? Why am I involved in this invitation? What is my relation to Lisa's death? What relation do I have with Salina? Maybe it's just like what you've said. Because the murderer knows that you are my fiancée. The murderer wants to get revenge and wants us to see what happened to Lisa. I'm confused by your story. If the murderer really wants everyone to see this, why only you guys are here? Why didn't she just invite the whole school to see what happened with Lisa? I don't think this is the way. What is the way that you are thinking about? I don't know! I don't even know Salina. I think there's something else. There are other things that you guys are hiding from me. Can you please stop thinking nonsense? The most important thing to me right now is for the rain to stop, so all of us can leave this place. Do you think we can leave when the rain stops? All the cars are broken, there is no phone connection, and we are in the middle of nowhere. Who is going to help us here? It's okay. When the rain stops, I'll go and fix the cars, all right? Now, please stop thinking nonsense. I want you to relax. Calm down. Fiq, Sofea is still unconscious? Is it true that only Lisa bullied Salina? Do you expect me to believe that? - What do you mean? - I believe all of you were involved. That's why the murderer invited all of you here. - Is that right? - Stop all the nonsense. You refuse to tell me, right? I'll wait for Sofea to wake up. I'll ask her myself. Suit yourself. Rania. What? Who knows, right? You are with Adam now. How long has it been? It has been a few years. After that incident, you disappeared. Only Adam was there. Rania. Please tell Adam not to tell the truth to Ivy. What's going on? What did you guys talk about? Nothing much. Norman just asked not to let Ivy know about the old stuff. But why were you guys holding hands? - He's the one who did it. - So you just let him do it? Or maybe you miss him? Missing his touch. - What's wrong with you? - That's why you really want to come here. Pretending that you want to meet Lisa and see her wedding. - You just miss your ex-boyfriend. - Don't start. - What's wrong with you? - What's wrong with me? Am I wrong? I didn't even know that Norman would be here. As if. It's true. Because I also didn't expect to see you guys here. I'm here by coincidence because I followed Ivy. If I know this is the same Lisa that I knew, I wouldn't come here. Not after knowing that Ammar was murdered a few days ago. Ammar is dead? Ammar, Lisa's ex-boyfriend. Remember? That's why if I knew you guys would be here, I wouldn't come here. Because what happened in the past is the worst thing that happened in my life. The worst thing ever? - I don't think so. - What's wrong? Do you want to fight? Is it me or you? - Hey, listen! - Stop it! Norman. Norman. Honey! Honey. What's wrong? What are you doing with that thing? Where did you get it? The rain abated. So I think I can start looking for help out there for Sofea. At least try to get a phone connection. That's why I need this to protect me. Never mind. If that's so, I'll try to fix all the cars. But… Where can you get help? I think the nearest house is 10 km from here. Just let him search wherever he wants. He wants to save his girlfriend. That is what he is supposed to do. Unlike that person, destroying his own girlfriend. Fiq, why don't I go with you? Why would you? I'm feeling stuffy here. I'm feeling trapped. Let's go, Fiq. Rania! Rania. Rania! Why do you want to go so badly? Can't you just stay in the house? - Fiq. - Rania. Why would you follow him? I told you I feel stuffy staying inside this house. Furthermore, I'm tired of listening to all of your nonsense. Fiq and Ivy went from knowing nothing to knowing the story now. Didn't we promise each other to never say anything about it? I promise you that I'll never say anything about it, okay? Good. Now I want to follow Fiq. If anything happens to Sofea, I will not forgive myself. Don't go. Okay. I'll go with him. You stay here. Why don't you keep an eye on Norman? He said that he wants to repair the cars, right? Is that true? I think there's something wrong with him. Maybe he was the one who planned all these. What do you mean? He planned all these? I don't know. I'm stressed so I just blurted it out. But let's think. He said he didn't receive Lisa's invitation. He is just following Ivy by chance. Is it true? Something is wrong with him. That is why I said he was the one who planned all these. - I'm done. - Don't do it. It's dangerous outside! I don't want you to be in danger. I'll go and you'll stay here. Fiq! Wait for me! Why? Now you are afraid of me? Lock the door. I want to repair the cars. Where is Adam? He followed Fiq. Ivy, can I ask you something? What is it? Did Norman come here by chance or did Lisa invite him over for her wedding? I don't know anymore. It is true that Lisa only invited me, not Norman. But when I arrived here, only then did I know that all of you were in the same school. Fiq, we have walked far. There's still no phone connection. So do you want to go back? Go back? Let's go. Hey, Adam. If you want to go back, go by yourself. But I'm not. Because I want to save Sofea. So do you want to follow me or not? Rania. Can you be honest with me? Let me know the truth about what is happening now and what happened then. I want to know everything. I'm not sure if you are afraid of Norman or because Adam is here. But now it's only us here. I want to know. Norman is my future. He's my future husband. I want to know everything and I want to know who is Salina. Salina. A new student in our school. Salina! Our school was a private school for the elite. Only those who are from an elite family can enroll there. But Lisa found out that Salina was a nobody. She came from a poor family. She got accepted because her mom worked hard to enroll her there. Salina was accepted because of her excellent examination results in her previous school. In fact, her marks were higher than most students in our school. She was also sponsored by Lisa's dad because of her excellent results. But why was Salina's mom so eager to send her to that school? I don't know. Maybe because of better connections, better exposure for the future. If you attended an elite school, it will be easier for you to find a job after graduating because of connection and networking. Yes, stuff like that. But… I don't really know. Lisa didn't really like Salina. To her, Salina didn't deserve any attention from anyone. Moreover, Lisa's dad is the founder of the school. So to Lisa, she's the one who should receive the attention from everyone. Not Salina. Until one day, her grudge against Salina became more intense. At that time, Salina went to the storeroom to keep the sports equipment. Stop it. But what she saw made Lisa hate her more. Hey! Come here! Come here! What did you see? I didn't see anything. You're lying! If I can see you, it means you can see me, right? If you tell anyone about this, I'll kill you! Get lost! But the bad story about what Lisa and Ammar did started to spread around. It's Lisa. - It's Lisa. - Lisa's here. She thinks she's great. Disgusting. A whore! Why did you tell everyone about me? I've warned you, right? No, Lisa. It wasn't me. Please let me go. Let me go! Liar! You're a liar. Why are you such a blabbermouth? - Lisa, stop it! - What's wrong with you? Why are you defending this poor bitch? Because of her, the whole school calls me a whore. Did you know that? Stop it. Let's go! But is it true that Salina was the one who spread the rumor? No. Actually, Ammar was the one who spread the rumor. Lisa's boyfriend. But Lisa didn't believe it. She was still accusing Salina of it. The worst thing was, Lisa asked Ammar to rape Salina. Watch the door. Don't let anyone else in. What are you doing? What are you doing? Help! Let me go! Help! Let me go! -Help me! - It will only take a second. Let me go. Because of that incident, Salina was too depressed and committed suicide. Salina! I'm sorry, Ivy. I wasn't supposed to tell you this, but you were the one who asked me. Ivy. Ivy! Ivy! Ivy! Ivy! Norman! - Ivy. - Norman! Norman! - Ivy. - Ivy. What's wrong, honey? I was searching for a phone connection, but I still couldn't find it. The cars are still broken. I can't fix it tonight. Ivy! Norman, I'm so sorry. I had to tell Ivy the truth that you were not able to do anything when Ammar raped Salina. - I'm sorry. - Unable to do anything? Were you stupid? What did you tell me? You told me if it happened in front of your eyes, you wouldn't let it happen. Why did you let it happen? Why did you let it happen? I thought I knew you well, but I was wrong. I'm wrong! Ivy. Yes, I admit it. I admit everything that Rania told you is true. I knew everything, but I did nothing. But at that time, I was just a kid. I was immature. I was scared. I was afraid if I did anything, my… My future will change. Now you know who Lisa's dad is, right? If I fight with Lisa and Ammar, I don't think I'll be in this place right now. Why did you lie? You told me that only Lisa bullied Salina. I love you. I'm afraid. I'm afraid if I admit that I'm lying to you, you will hate me. Because honestly, I still hate myself until now because I didn't help her. Do you think that I don't feel guilty? Can you please stop lying to me? Are you still hiding anything from me? No. No. No. I promise you. I'm not hiding anything. Okay? Please don't lie to me again. Adam? - Adam! - Adam? Adam! Wake up, Adam! Adam! Adam, wake up! I'm worried about Fiq. He's outside. What if the murderer killed him? What if Fiq is the murderer? What do you mean? Can't you see it? The stab wound at his stomach matches the knife that Fiq brought along. It doesn't make sense at all. What is the relation between Fiq and Salina? We never knew Salina's family members, right? Do you mean Fiq might be Salina's older brother? Sofea! - Sofea! - Rania. - Sofea! Wake up! - Rania! - Sofea! - Rania! - What? - Calm down. Are you stupid? You're asking me to calm down? I want to wake her up and ask her who is Fiq. Adam is dead! What is the relation between Fiq and Salina? Sofea, wake up! - Wake up, Sofea! - Rania! I'll calm her down. Ivy. Sofea, you are awake. Sofea, are you okay? There's something that I need to tell you. Rania. What did you say? Do you want me to relax? Do you want me to relax? Hey, Norman! Adam is dead. The murderer killed Adam! If the murderer wants to kill all of us, he should show himself and kill us. Show yourself! Show yourself! Show yourself! Hey! Rania. Ivy. So all of these are happening because… Because… I want to get out of here, Norman. All of us want to get out of here. I'll make sure that all of us will get out of here safely. Do you promise? I promise. Do you still love me, Norman? Ivy! Ivy! Ivy! Honey! Honey. Sofea. Sofea. Sofea. Sofea. Sofea. I'll check the fuse box. You guys wait here. Rania, please look out for Ivy. Lock the door. Where is the fuse box? It's not here. It's not here too. Who's that? Who's that? You don't have to scare me! You are messing with the wrong person. Hey! Show yourself! Show yourself! Let me see who you are. Where are you? Show yourself! Show yourself! Where are you? Show yourself! Did you know? Before the murderer attacked us, Sofea told me everything. What do you mean? Actually, I heard what Rania told you. But what actually happened was worse than that. Salina! The truth is, the one who hated Salina was not Lisa, but you. Everything that Salina did was wrong to you as she was poor and owned nothing. But she was more likable than you. The founder of the school is your dad, not Lisa's dad. That's why you thought that you should be the one receiving the attention, not Salina. And your grudge was getting stronger. One day, Salina entered the storeroom - by chance. - Stop it! That's enough. Stop. Salina didn't see Lisa. Hey! But the truth was, Salina saw you - What did you see? - And Norman. I didn't see anything. If I can see you, then you can see me. If you tell anyone, you are done! I'll kill you! Get lost! Okay. - When Norman spread the story - Disgusting! - About how he got your body, - Seriously. You accused Salina of it. Why did you tell everyone about me? It wasn't me, Rania. Let me go. Liar! You are a liar! Why are you lying? Do you think you are so beautiful? Why are you such a blabbermouth? Stop it, Rania! The truth was Salina wasn't only raped by Ammar. She was also raped by Adam and Norman. What are you doing? Come here. Go away! Help! Let me go! Salina committed suicide because of you. No wonder the murderer wants to kill all of you. Shut up! If the murderer wants to kill us, you will be killed too because you are also in this hell! Good. I want to leave this place now.
