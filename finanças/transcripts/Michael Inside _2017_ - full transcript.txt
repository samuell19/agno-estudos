Fuck all, I'm just around at the green. Why, what's up? Yeah, I might have somebody, yeah. Here, come in for a second. My brother wants us. - For what? - Don't know. What's the craic? All right? Buzz into the gaff, yeah? Right, lads, I'm going to give you the shit. Fuck 'em. Don't tell anybody where you're hiding it. If anything goes missing, I'm dead. Are you taking it, yeah? Yeah, no bother. I'll talk to you after, all right? I appreciate that, all right? - No bother, yeah? - See you later. See you. - Michael? - Yeah. - All right, Grandad. - Morning. It's cold. Is there any milk? It's looking at you. Is that all that's left? I'm off to the shops. Have toast. - What are you doing later? - Meeting Orla. Barry's after texting me there, yeah? He said, "Move that." - Do you want it back? - No, he just said, "Move it." - Where am I supposed to move it? - How am I supposed to know? Here, hold on, boys. - Everything all right? - Yeah. Who was that? It was just Gary. It was nothing. I'd say so. It was. How was it nothing? It just was. Your dinner's ready. I have to go. See you later. Michael? I'm Detective Belton from St. Donnan Garda Station. I have a warrant to search this house. If you wouldn't mind going into the sitting room there for me, please, sir? Thank you very much. - For what? - You too, sir, please. Thank you very much. Now sit down there, young man. This is a mistake. Sure, it'll all be cleared up in a minute. Don't worry about it. Sit down there. Can I have another look at that warrant, please? Did you not see it the first time? It hasn't changed. Detective... - Is this your bag, Michael? - Guard. - Michael, is this your bag? - Guard. Sir, please. Michael? Yeah. All right, Michael. I'm arresting you under Section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, for the possession of controlled drugs for unlawful sale or supply. Anything you say can be used in evidence against you in a court of law. You have the right to a solicitor. If you cannot afford one, one will be provided to you. Do you understand your rights? Yeah. All right, stand up. Get up there, son. - Is that okay for you? Not too tight, no? - No. I'll follow you down, Michael. Do you have a solicitor? - I think so. - You don't know who it is, do you? - My grandad knows. They're all in court now anyway, until this evening. If you just tell us who gave you the bag, and I can sort bail and you can go home. Your da's in jail, isn't he? If you tell us who gave you the bag, we'll see if we can get him out a little bit early. I'm not a rat. You're not a dealer either, Michael. All right, so, Michael, can you confirm your address for me, please? 15 Fortune Avenue, St. Donnan Estate. Can you describe the house? It's brown with a white door. And your bedroom, where is it in the house? It's at the front. All right. Where were you this morning? I was at home. And can you tell us what we found in your bedroom this morning? No comment. You already told us the bag was yours, Michael. Did you not? When I asked you this morning, "Was the bag yours?" You said, "Yeah." Yeah. Good, okay. Is there anything else you'd like to add? No. Okay. Okay, Michael, I am charging you with possession of a Class A substance with intent to supply. And I'm granting you station bail of one hundred euro, okay? Now you'll be due to appear in Court on February 20th. Sign this, please. Have you anything to say? Can I have me phone back? It's being held in evidence. Get on to your solicitor. Why did you do it? Gary's my mate. And you always do what they tell you? No. I was supposed to move it. It's my own fault. Did you tell them anything? No. I called a solicitor. You could go down for this, you know. - I know, yeah. - Is that all you can say? Well what do you want me to say? Just when we were getting somewhere. They took my phone. I want it back. - Where are you going? - Away from you. Hang on. What the fuck are you doing around here, you stupid cunt? -What? - I told you to fucking move it. - I was going to. - You were going to, what good is that? They showed up at my house. I might go down for this. Well, it's your own fucking fault. Come on, man. Stay away from here, you fucking eejit. Did you hear? Yeah. Where are you? I'm at the shops. - Can you come out? - No. My da won't let me. Who told you? Everyone knows. - Are you all right? - Yeah, I'm grand. Did you do it? Do what? I was only holding a bag for Gary. What's going to happen? I don't know, do I? What are you doing? I'm watching "Pointless." Who are you with? Ash. I've to go. Talk to you later, yeah? See you later. You made a mistake. Do you think I'll go down? I don't know. I'm going to bed, yeah? Nothing before you turned 18 will be taken into account, but your probation order last October will be a factor, I'm afraid. Will he do time for this? Well, be prepared for it, Michael. He's not involved in drugs. It's enough involvement for a custodial sentence, I'm afraid. Would you recommend an early plea? Well, it's safer to look at the evidence first. It might not be strong enough. But an early plea will mean a lighter sentence? If convicted, yes. You're free to ignore my advice. It's up to you. When did you leave school, Michael? Fourth year. Tell him about that teacher. What's that got to do with this? He was bullied by a teacher at school. What did you do then? Worked with my Grandad for a bit. - Doing what? - Painting and decorating. Then I started Youth Reach last year. Well, I think we should get this over as quick as possible. I might not go down. It doesn't matter. I can't go through it with you. Your da can't tell you what to do. It's not him. It is. I know it is. It's not. I'm only 16. I wasn't dealing. It was just a favor. I know. I wasn't dealing. All right, you weren't dealing. I don't do that. -I'm sorry. - It's a bit late now, isn't it? Please. No. Where are you going? - Orla. - Leave me alone. So, just take responsibility. Make a solemn promise you won't be in trouble with the law again. No bother. Is there any more he can do? Just be respectful, stand up straight Say, "Yes, Judge," "No, Judge." Hands by your side. - Yeah - Okay? Ready to go? On the first of February, I arrested Michael McCrea, under Section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, for possession of controlled drugs for unlawful sale or supply. He was detained for questioning under Section 2 at St. Donnan Garda Station. He was released on station bail to appear before this court this morning, Judge. Good morning, Judge, I appear on behalf of Michael McCrea. Judge, I have a Precis of Evidence and I'm requesting a short remand to take instructions. My client wishes to plead guilty this morning. He is not working at present. He is a student, currently studying at Youth Reach and will be making an application for legal aid. Is there any objection to this? No, Judge. Can I hear an outline of the facts for consideration for jurisdiction, please? Yes, judge, um... The address 15 Fortune Avenue where Mr. McCrea resides was searched and a white plastic bag was found in a wardrobe in an upstairs room. It contained 30 grams of cocaine with a street value of around 2,000 Euro. Are there any aggregation factors I should know of? No, Judge. I'm not going to finalize this today. To be remanded on continuing bail for a probation report. Thank you, Judge. Thank you, Judge. Okay, come. Do you want me to open it? Thursday. This one's at two o'clock. What does that mean? Am I going down? Okay everyone, drop your essay in the box on the way out and don't forget to put your name on it. Michael? Can I have a word? I heard about what happened. Is there anything that we can do from here? No, I don't think so. You must be under a lot of pressure. -You said about Pearse College? - Yeah, Social Care, wasn't it? - Yeah. - Okay, yeah, would you be interested? Yeah. Right, I'll make that call for you. - Thanks, miss. - Okay. - How's it going, Michael? - All right. Are you well? Michael? What are you doing up? Where were you? Out. How are you doing? Shite. I want you to visit your da tomorrow. Ask him what he thinks. I'm still in the Medical Unit. You won't see me if you come here. I know that. Why didn't you move it? I was going to. What do you want me to say? Nothing, Da. Stop thinking so much. I'm not. How's my da? Yeah, he's grand. You'll be all right. Pass the remote there, will you? No, I'm watching this. - I'm away to bed then. - Go then. I feel sick. Go back to bed. I won't be able for it. It won't be as bad as you think. It will. You'll have to toughen up, Michael. Just keep your head down. Don't piss anybody off and you'll be okay. There's a lot of normal people in there. You can do it. - I can't. - You can. You're not a kid anymore. Go back to bed now. Don't say where you're from unless you know who you're talking to. - Do you hear me? - Yeah. Now, eat. I'm not hungry. Well, force yourself. Are you ready? Are you going to be all right? Yeah. The defendant is also attending Youth Reach, currently finishing a QQI Level Four in General Learning. He has expressed a desire to attend a Further Education college. Judge, Michael is not ordinarily involved in the drug trade. He was impulsive and naive and didn't think through his actions. There are other mitigating circumstances. There was a lack of parental influence in Michael's life growing up. His mother died, and his father is currently in prison. We ask for some leniency in this instance to allow Michael to further his education. Have you anything to say, Mr. McCrea? Yes, Judge. I just want to say I'm sorry for what I done and I promise it won't happen again. You say impulsive and naive but this is not a first conviction. No, Your Honor. I see he was on probation bond at the time of his offence with conditions that he does not offend in the next 12 months. His last conviction was due to similar naivety. He was a passenger in a stolen car. But Michael is on a positive path now, and he has learned his lesson this time. His grandfather is here to support him today. This is a serious crime. Young man, do you realize the consequences of the drug trade in our society? Yes, Judge. My mam died of a drug overdose when I was really young. Michael McCrea, you were a minor, but essential cog in a well-oiled machine. I have a duty to impose a custodial sentence. It is the court's belief that you would benefit from a short, sharp shock. Taking into account a plea of guilty at an early stage, I sentence you to three months in custody. One month suspended. I hope you will learn from this, Mr. McCrea and we don't see you before the courts again. Michael. Just hang on there a second. Any phone on you? He got nothing. All right, pal? What's the story? What are you up for? Huh? Where are you from? I know your face from somewhere. Take responsibility for the crime, make a sincere oath. You won't be in trouble with the law again. Mr. McCrea? Give me a call if you need anything, anytime. Hands out of your pockets, okay? Where did you get the chain, mate? I bought it a while back. Yeah, I'm surprised they let you in with that. Leave him alone, lads. If anybody says anything, I'm going in, I'm not getting out. So you'll see me inside. If you see me inside, come over to me I'll look after you. Now, Michael, are you right? Let's go. Michael, listen to what I said to you, do you hear me? He's not going to last long. I'll see him inside. He's going to get bleedin' tore out of it. Hand over the chain. - What's the name? - Michael McCrea. The address? 15 Fortune Avenue, St. Donnan Estate. Are you fighting with anyone? No. Do you need protection? No. Empty out the pockets. Just hang in there for a second. Right, this way. Ever in jail before? - No. - Never? You get used to it. McCrea? Stop there. Thanks. Come on. Stop. Step up. Show me your hands. Make some room, lads. Come on. Okay, have you anything sharp in your pockets? -No. - I'm going to search you, okay? Okay, hold out your arms. Okay go over to that man there. He needs to have a word with you.

Michael, do you have any medical conditions that we need to know about? Anxiety. Are you on medication for that? No. Okay, the next questions we have to ask you will be in confidence. Do you understand that? Yeah. Okay, are you in fear for your life? No. Do you need protection? No. Okay, sign your name there. Straight on. You're going through that gate there. Inmate 10287E, Michael McCrea, sir. What are you looking at? Go on in. Take a seat. Now do you intend to appeal your sentence? No, sir. Look at me. We're not going to have any trouble with you now, are we? No, sir. Now take a good look at these. Do you know any of those men? I don't think so. What about these fellas here? I know them to see.

Are you being smart? - Are you? - No. - Where you from? - Dublin. Do you know what you just did? Do you remember me? Huh? I don't know you. That's not what I said. Do you recognize me? - Do you hear me, are you deaf? - I heard you. - What's your problem? - There's no problem. Where are you from? It's a simple question. I told you. - Do you want to get your throat slit? - No. - Do you? - No. - Then why are you being smart? - I'm not. Look at me. - Say you're sorry. - I'm sorry. Too late, cunt. Do you know anyone in here? - Yeah. - Who? No one? A few people. If you don't know anyone, you're fucked. All right, Francis? - I'd like to take it all out please, Sandra. You can't pay them.

Social Care. Wait... Think about when you get out. You've got to fight back in here, Michael. Look at me. Do you hear me? McCrea? You have to attack that fella. What? You have to attack him. - It's none of your business. - He'll be back in to you then. Again and again and more people will. Come on, he's in his cell now. - No. - No? All right. I wait outside the door, you follow. I'm not asking, how's that? What do you mean? If I don't move off, that means he's in there on his own. Do you understand? Why are you doing this?

What are you, pissed? I don't drink. Since when? Nineteen years. Do you like "Darts"? I want to make something clear. Who's he? I want to make something very clear. - Well, hurry up. - I'm paying the debt. - Yeah, I know. - Because of what Michael got messed up in. But I'm not paying you thugs another penny. Are you not? You can kill me. But you're not getting nothing more from me. Don't worry about it, no one's killing anyone. - Yes. - That's me cleaned out. Tony. Don't be worrying about it, old man. The debt's paid now. See you later. Open your hand. - What? - Open your hand. Put it away. Put it away. - I don't want that. - Hold it until I want it. 'Cause we help each other in here. Don't call anyone with that. The case got a strike out anyway. The fuckin' copper never turned up. - Yeah? - Yeah. The shopkeeper's family and all were there. - That's mad. - Mmm. Do what I say, yeah? Yeah. Stay. Sit down, sit down. Michael, this is Steve. - What do you want? - What do I want? I saw your brother. With his bird, was it? No, my ma. Did they leave my money? Dave, you know, you said I could give that to you next week. Sit down. - Sit the fuck down. - What are you doing? So you knew they were coming, and you didn't tell them, hmm? Hmm? - Sorry, I didn't think-- - Look at me. You didn't think. You didn't fuckin' think. Steve. Steven. Look at me. Do you think I'm a fuckin' mug? No. Michael, come here. No, no. Michael, please. No, you don't have to do this, lads. You don't want to do this. Don't! Please, don't do this. What are you doing? No! Please! Please, no! Please! No! Please! No... Are we quits now? Ask me again and I'll stamp your face into the concrete. Open your hand. Hold it. I first went into prison when I was 13. I've been inside most of my life. I got out for the last time in 2007 an angry man. I think everyone comes out bitter no matter what they tell you. The longer the stretch, the bigger the scar. I still feel anger when I see a uniform. I don't think that'll change. The reason they asked me to do this is I've finished a Masters now in Criminology and I'm applying for a Doctorate. When I say that out loud, it doesn't sound like me. The last time I came out, I done nine year for armed robbery. They said to me, "Sam, all you need to change now is everything." They were talking about my addiction. Which started during my first sentence and that led to all my other convictions. A lot of people don't understand that when everyone around you is doing gear and your self-worth is rock bottom, it can make sense inside. For me, it was relief from the pain of being a prisoner. Like a day out. But as most of you know, the pain is much worse when you have a drug habit. For me and my family, heroin meant a road to complete hell. I'd get clean and then relapse. Get clean again, relapse. And then I got clean for my grand-daughter Kelly's communion. I did it for her. And I'm not going back. Eileen, down the community center is my guardian angel. She got me onto an Open University course. I flew through it. At 45, I realized I was intelligent. In college, good things started to happen. The more I achieved, the more I wanted to continue. And I could see that the first half of my life had been such a waste. I hope you've taken something from this. I want to thank you for letting me tell my story. I'll take any questions. Maybe we can get a bit of a conversation going. Explain the point of college? To get a decent job? You'll always have to tick that box, Michael. And if they've to pick between you and someone without a conviction, who are they going to pick? Forget about buying a house. Forget about going to the States. - For how long? - For life, pal. - Why? - Why? Why do you think? To keep us down. You're fucked out there now if you want to live straight. Your sentence only starts when you're released, just watch. Do you have kids? I've a son in Wales. Yeah? Bobby. He's 12. Bobby. Does he visit? He's in Wales. Is that where his ma lives? No. No. Open your hand. Put the fuckin' thing away. - Slash his face. - What? Not a bleedin' scratch, deep. On my own? I'm sick. I don't give a fuck. I'm after throwing up, and I've a fucking headache. Do it. I can't. I'm not cut out for it. The next time you try and fuck up my system, you think of Francis. Oi? McCrea? Governor wants to see you. - For what? - Now! Do you know what he wants me for? Have you been doing anything you're not supposed to? No. Then you've nothing to worry about, have you? Were you involved in that yesterday? No. Inmate 10287E Michael McCrea, sir. Yes, sir. Right, send him in. In you go. Sit. You're being released. You'll be outside at midday tomorrow. Thanks. - Do you have anywhere to live? - Yeah. You'll be given details of your post-release program later on. Before you leave. - Thanks, sir - Right, that's all. Grandad? - I'm getting out. - Thank God. I'll be outside at 12:00 tomorrow. I'll be there. No you don't have to, don't be worrying. I'll see you at home. I'll be there. Grandad, I just... I'm sorry about everything. It's over now, Michael. Look, I've to go back now, yeah? I'll see you tomorrow. I'll see you. - Guess what? - Guess what? What the fuck is this? I couldn't say no. - You trying to get me more charges, is it? - No. - I can't get any more time, you know that. - I know. - You trying to ruin my life? - No, Ray. What else is there? Just a phone. Just a phone... Then get it. Are you fucking for real? Just give it back to him, all of it, yeah? I can't. What do you mean you can't? Now! Don't push me, Michael. I'm getting out. Tomorrow. Sorry I fucked up. I have your stuff. Give it. Michael. Sit down. Don't let anyone fuck with you out there, okay? Good lad, go. Go. We're not going to see you back in here again, Michael, are we? No you won't. I have interviews lined up and all. Have you? What for? PLC courses and that. Very good. Where are you going to stay? I'm going home. And who's there? My grandad. And is he coming to pick you up? Yeah. Good. McCrea, get ready. Your probation officer's name is Frank Cleary. He's just off Mountjoy Square. His address is on that. I'll give him a call this afternoon. - Cheers, Ray. - Take it easy, Michael. Don't go acting the big man when you get out. I won't. - Good luck. - Cheers. - Good luck, Michael. - Cheers. Just tell me again now what he needs to bring with him. A CV and two references. Um... Now you... Tell me, would a character reference be all right? - Michael, what's the story? - All right? - When did you get out? - Just today. - Why didn't you ring me? - Just out. - You are, are you? - Yeah. - Dog rough, was it? - Yeah. - If you say so. - Rough. Michael? Michael? Are you right? We're going. I can't wait for this fight. "St. Balthere Estate are scum"? Yeah, they fucking are scum. Do you think they'll have more people than us? No way, we have a bigger estate. Count me out, lads, yeah? Suit yourself. The bleedin' cops are watching Facebook, you thick. Well, get off it. Oi! Are you involved in these fights? No. - Do you know there's a curfew? - I'm 18. - Are you being smart? - No. Do you want me to get out of this car? No. Empty your pockets. The other ones. - Where are you going? - Home. - Well, hurry up then. - Yes, Guard. All right, Grandad? Thought I'd do some decent food. Lovely. Are you all set? Yeah. Well, just... Just be yourself. Are you sure about that? Could you tell us a little about yourself? Like what? Like, do you know much about the course? It's Social Care. That's right. Sorry I'm just nervous. That's okay, Michael. Why are you interested in Social Care? Uh... My teacher said it would suit me? Okay. - I work well with people. - Right. I'm trying to better myself. Okay. And have you read the prospectus? No, sorry. - But I will. - That's fine. I want to use what happened to me as a positive, to help others. I think I'd be good at stuff like that. Okay, do you have your references with you? Yeah, right here. - Francis McCrea? - My grandad. We need employment or educational references. They said I could choose a character one? I'm waiting on my school one, and one of them is from Youth Reach. All right, Michael. All right? Are you just out? Yeah, man. Well, Henry's da is in there now. For what? For driving in the bus lane. Is he actually? Yeah, he is. Ah, that's stupid. I know, isn't it? What were you in there for? Holding drugs for a mate Eh. See, that's what happens when you get in with the wrong crowd, isn't it? I brought it in last week. That letter only entitles you one weeks' payment. So you need to sign on to the live register now. Well, sign me on, then. You need to give me an address. Love, I'm only out a week. I'm sorry, Mr. Moore. I'm between places. I need an address. Now in the meantime, you can go down to your local community welfare officer. They will sort you out with one weeks' emergency payment. Or you can go down to the homeless unit on Parkgate Street. Why don't you people give me an address? Will you come back to us when you have everything required to sign on, please? -What am I supposed to live on? - Thank you. Are you trying to send me back? This is a fucking joke. Nothing's gonna happen. Tony. What the fuck are you doing here? Hello, Michael. Take a seat. Must be good to be out, right? What do you want? Tell him. I didn't agree to anything. Just fucking tell him. They want me to take drugs into the prison when I'm visiting Christy. - Christy's agreed. - I doubt that. Well, you know, agreed. Didn't have a choice. Much like you. Whatever you lost, I'll pay for it. Bill's already been paid. Did he not tell you? You paid them? What else could I do? What else could he do? So, are you gonna do it? I know guys you don't want to fuck with. - Locked up? - He's not doing it. If he doesn't do what I say, I'm going to take your da. You'll never see him again. You're not doing this. - What choice do I have? Why did you pay them? I want you to go up North. - You're not doing this. - Will you go to your nan? This isn't right, Grandad. It's not right. - It's not right, Grandad. - Calm down. How did the interview go? Fuck the interview. Where are you going? Fuck this place. Michael. Michael! Oi. What are you doing? Go near my grandad again, I'll be fucking back. - Michael? - Yeah. Are you okay? Yeah. This was a vicious and brutal attack. Michael McCrea, you are sentenced to three years in custody. Have you ever been to prison before? Yeah. Are you involved in any feuds at the moment, Mr. McCrea? Yeah. With who? You don't want to fuck this up, Francis. You're going through that gate there.
