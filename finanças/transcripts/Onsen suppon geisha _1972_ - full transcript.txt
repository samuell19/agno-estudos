Please leave me alone, sis. I just want what's best for you. Old-fashioned! Is being a hot-spring geisha your sacrifice for your sister? - Old-fashioned... - Asai! This is a note for the ethics class. I would like to give it to you if you. Thank you! This is my sister. My name is Shinji Sanekata. I'm in my senior year at law school. Pleased to meet you. Likewise. Thank you very much for taking care of my sister. Asai! Would you like to go for a drive around Lake Biwa? You're going to take me to a motel after that, right? Please go to the dance party with me. If I bring you with me, I can brag about it. Natusko! Let's go to the club. It must be fun! I have to reject all your invitations today. Sis, this is why I can't give up my university life. I don't have to pay for anything! Don't say that! I'm going to treat you today. I got a part-time job recently. - A part-time job? - Yeah. Welcome! You guys seem very excited today. Of course! Out team turned the game around at the final inning and won! This is the first victory in the past 6 seasons. Have fun, have fun! Asai? Sayuri Sanjo? You've been doing a part-time in a place like this? Sanekata, do you know Sayuri Sanjo, the new strip star? Didn't know you were into this stuff. Professor! She is not a stripper! Don't have to hide it. Sit. Oh... Who knew a stubborn geek like you would visit Deluxe Tohji. Tell me more specifically later, okay? What are you talking about, Professor? Natsuko is the student of your university. Ridiculous! I went to see your strip performance yesterday and last week at Deluxe Tohji. Even at the front row. I even have evidence. I have kept it with great care. Hey, this is your hair. So, it was definitely you. Am I right? I can't keep listening to this stupidity anymore. I have a student ID. I can't believe this. This student ID is a fake. This is a fake stamp. The stamp of my university has a thicker outline. Shit, busted! You have kept the secret even from me, your only family member, for 2 years! Why don't you say something? For me, you know... I thought the only thing I could say proudly to our late parents could be making you a wife of an upper-class family. Asai family had been running the most prestigious soft-shell turtle restaurant in Asakusa for 6 generations! If only our father didn't ruin the business because of his over-enthusiasm over natural soft-shell turtles, we would've been having a great life as posh sisters. I didn't want to lose our pride even if the business had collapsed. I am not really that much thankful for your sacrifice. I really hate to attend a school. Then why did you lie to me about the admission? Because I felt bad about your sacrifice! Shit! Asai! You are the flower of the campus. You represent my youth. Come back to the uni. I am a fake student. I don't care whether you are fake or not. Asai, I feel lonely if I don't see your face. I am not joking. I feel liberated after I quit the uni. Ah? There she is! Finally met her! I have been looking for you everywhere in Kyoto by taxi. Who are you? How amazing you are... Wait for a sec! You are beautiful. Your body proportion is perfect. The breast and ass... But... there is one thing not in sync. Do you know about that? I don't know. Your hair and skin. The age of black hair has passed already. Hey, mister. Who are you, boy? Shhh... Take this. Blonde hair and white skin. I, Takamura Mori, a body makeover expert, will complete you with what you don't have. You have to see it by yourself. Please come to my lab. Mori Body Makeover Lab She was once a hopeless-looking girl. Now she has been totally changed. She is Natalie Green, an Irish American. How do you do? Her speech is not complete though. So can you trust me after seeing this? You are... Greta Garbo, no, Marianne De Pri... Who is that? Maybe too old-fashioned. You can beat Bridget Bardot, Candice Bergen or Catalina Deneuve. Makeover is the hope and miracle of the modem age. You, Sanjo! Let's make over your beautiful body... - Doctor! - What's the problem? I have been waiting for 3 weeks over here. Please make me into a Parisian. I have money. Here! You and a Parisian? Yes! Oh... good, good. Let's start from the bottom anyway. Good! Thank you! Take off your underwear. - Open your legs and stand here. - Yes! Well... Sulfuric acid... Sodium hydroxide... Ammonia is not necessary... Hey, why didn't you have a shower before take the treatment? Sorry. Yours is a Motel Straight Hair type. Something is coming out. Chemical reaction is occurring. But! Your beard and your nose breath are being mixed... Don't move. Something will go wrong. Extreme transformation! No, no! You cannot become a Parisian by any means! Doctor! You are so mean! Wait. I realized something. Let's make you into a negro. Negro? Totally different... Stop crying! Even though there is some racism, now is the time when black people can lead the world. Black power! Well... Negro extract... Nitrogen... It depends on the person... 66... Putting some coffee beans... Too much... and... Shoeshine powder... Old Black Joe... Wow! I've made a decent negro for the first time since I started my study! Takamaru is a genius! Takamaru is a genius! Oh, no! Ms. Asai! What's up, miss? Natsuko! It's a telegram. An urgent one. For me? "Your sister is in a critical condition. Come right now." Sis is critical?! The Southern Lecher The Founder of the School of Unlimited Semen Saoshi Danpei Who is this man with the two weirdos? They go around red-light districts of hot-spring villages around the nation, Assistant Expert Grade 8 Dankitsu Kurosao seduce the girls sexually and sell them. They are human traffickers called Women-Hunter Danpei and his underlings. The Underling Grade 5. Piston Ken. I can do it. That lips. That neck. That breast. That waist. The best I have ever seen. I can do it. Are you talking about me? Right! We are about to arrive Yunohana. Please don't forget your belongings when you get off. Anyways sorry again. Excuse me. Sorry. Yoshie has been strange since she came back from Kyoto. She didn't go out to serve customers and drank every day. She has been looking exhausted. Finally she got fired. Sister! What is that soft-shell turtle weirdo, Mr. Kura, doing now, not visiting Yoshie already? Mr. Kura! My sister liked you. Why didn't you many her? I couldn't do it. She was the daughter of the man who saved my life. What daughter? Even now I see it in my dream... I was wandering around Ueno. I was very hungry. The only thing I thought of was eating something. At that time, your father took me to the shop. I will never forget the taste of the soft-shell turtle soup your father gave me saying "Eat as much as you want." It was the genuine taste of soft-shell turtle. I think the taste of soft-shell turtle soup should stay that way forever. So, about 15 years ago, I released 500 baby soft-shell turtles into this stream. I must find those baby soft-shell turtles. It's not possible that they are still there. When are you going to give up that stupid dream? It's not a stupid dream. I am talking about the soft-shell turtles your father had been talking about. They must be somewhere in the river. Hey, girl! Wow, I thought you're Catalina Deneuve. Look here. Little bit to the right. More right... About that. Okay. Smile broadly. How rude! Wait... wai... wait! Sony. Sony. Do you know me? I am the best cameraman of Japan. I was hired by the tourism industries around here for making a poster for traditional snacks. Could you work as a model for me? Saho Sasasada's work "Kogarashi Monjiro." Monjiro? I mean it's nothing to do with me. You say weird things... Wa... wait! You walk so fast! I pay you handsomely. - How much would you pay? - 50,000! - 50,000!? - Good then! I give you 100,000! 100,000?! Okay! When you play baseball... play like this... when you throw a ball... receive like this... when you swing... receive like this... Shinji Tonoyama, writer and actor Oniroku Dan, writer when you become a runner... run like this... Hosuke Fukuchi, cartoonist Out! Safe! Let's go! Rock, scissors, paper! Excuse me! Komimasa Tanaka, writer Sir! Please feel free to tell me if you have someone you are interested in. Nobody tonight! This! This girl is... well... just a model... I don't care. Do something. She looks exactly like my first love when I was in school. Am I sleeping with the chairman? Natsuko! Please! Do me a favor for the development of the hot-spring businesses around here. How does sleeping with that old man have anything to do with the development of the village? That person is the chairman of the Japan Business Federation. What is that? Japan Business Federation? Japan! Business! Federation! Meaning he is the powerful person of the big businesses. Even the prime minister has to behave in front of him. Otherwise, his administration would become unstable. That much important person! It has nothing to do with me. If Natsuko does us a favor, we will reduce 200,000 out of 2,000,000 in your sister's debt. Okay then! If you do this for us, we will convene a meeting and give Natsuko Asai 300,000. How about this? Sis, why don't you do it then? I mean it's not something that runs out... 500,000?! Well... After paying 1,500,000, all the debt will be gone then? Okay, do it then! Good evening! Oh! Beautiful! It's like Madonna has appeared in front me! You are Natsuko? Incredible! My spirit has just come back! Do this mahjong! Not that mahjong! You stupid mahjong maniac! Ah! I got a blank! I got all three right! Shit! I can't help it anymore! - First gear, got it? - Yes. - Second gear, got it? - Yes. - Third gear... got it? - Yes. Nothing more? No more gears? I won't use everything at once. Once you get used to it, you won't get satisfied. How is it? The technique I mastered when I was studying in France. Uh? It's a puddle. A big puddle. What is this? This is the best service I can offer. When I get into the climax, I pee. Uh? It's wet all over. What are you talking about? Do you want me to harass you more? You are my slave tonight. Have a wrestle with the queen! I was born as a sadist. Uh? Sadist? I am a sadist too. Ah! Not ready yet! Ah... Ah... please harass me more. Are you a sadist or masochist? I am a sadist and masochist. Ah! Both! Madonna! It's tightening... tightening! Tu... turtle! Turtle! Turtle! Tightening! Turtle!!! Uh? Disgusting... Ah... how is it? This is a paradise... Ah... don't split! Nurse! Get a rope from the storage. And call a crane to pull this... Go! Hurry! Ah, don't split! Please don't split! It's a paradise! Calm down, old man! It must be painful when that thing is tightened like that. Ah... please don't split! Don't be stupid! Dad, why did you bother to come here from Osaka? You need some money, right? Yea, Nobuko is going a school trip next month. And your mother doesn't do well either. Don't be silly. Why didn't you write a letter to me? The train fare is wasteful. I have 17,500 in here. Bring this home then. This money will do, Yoko. Thank you. Yoko, why don't you carry this freshwater tortoise as a lucky charm? It smells good too. What? Isn't this for our shop to sell?! Well, the department stores sell this freshwater tortoise too. Of course, no shop sells natural ones like this. Maybe I have to deal with shops too. Yoko, whatever you do, you should take care of your beautiful, healthy body. Father... Wait for me... I will work hard and earn a lot of money for you... You had been stuck until it thundered... You must be protected by the soft-shell turtle god. Is your current body structure the same as when you were born? The chairman can't stop talking about the soft-shell turtle geisha. I don't know exactly. I was born prematurely at seven months. My family was running a soft-shell turtle restaurant, right? And my father fed me with the blood of soft-shell turtle instead of milk. Natsuko, would you like to become a geisha? Me? Yes. You can pay back all of your sister's debt just after 3 months. And the payment after that will be all yours. Smart people can earn money by using their brain. Good-looking people can earn money by using their body. This is how I think about life. Ummm... I can agree to that. I don't like to follow an ordinary route. - Gonna do it then? - Yes. In order to pay back the debt, that's the fastest route. Great! Ma'am, please make me a geisha too. Yoko? I like doing a physical job. I can't just let Natsuko do the job alone. I am a daughter of a freshwater tortoise shop at Hozenji area in Osaka. Freshwater tortoise is just like soft-shell turtle. When they bite, they never let you go. Wait a minute! Where is Mr. Sato? Good evening! Hey, look over there! Look over there! Kurajiro, the infamously craziest, is looking for soft-shell turtles again. Kura! Why don't you wear a woman's ass costume on you? If you need, I can give you mine! There it is! Kurajiro is such a weirdo! Mr. Kura! Why are you so obsessed with soft-shell turtles that much? - Miss! - Don't call me "Miss!" The word "Miss" made my sister's life miserable. - Miss... - No more "Miss" from now on. Please leave me alone. Mr. Kura! Oh?! Dr. Mori! Welcome back! Highlight! Peace! Hurry, hurry, hurry! Since I have brought blondes for a while... This time I brought a negro. She is quite popular... I always appreciate your efforts. However, I cannot make your face into a foreign one by any means. Maybe making an animal would be easier though. I am just joking... Let's introduce each other. She is Ms. Natalie Green. How do you do? And then, this girl is Ms. Audrey Popcorn. Oh, Mr. Kojima, how do you do? One, two, three, four... Kojima, give me clean notes. I am going to make a Khoikhoi person next time. W... what? What's this commotion? Who are you? I am Sasasada from the Fighting Spirit clan. Saho Sasasada, the author of "Kngarashi Monika" The Spirit clan? Are you some kind of cult? Idiot! You touched 3 girls from our shop. They... came to me by their own will. Shut up! It hurts! Please stop. What's this commotion in this daylight? I think you have mistaken this area for some kind of gang turf. Miss, you have no business with this person, right? No, I have. Ah, you are so pretty. If you make me aroused with that face, I will let him go. Is this enough to express gratitude to you? You need more? Nah, I refuse. That was impressive. I don't like it. I definitely won't go. But... he is the president of Saneura, a cosmetics maker which has 150 branches. How can you refuse that kind of offer, mom? Hey, everyone? What is the reason why you don't want to go? Actually, he has 5 women around him already, who live everyday like dead people. Why? About 3 years ago, he fell from the bed and broke his back while sleeping with a mistress. And he has never recovered since then. He has Permanent Erectile Syndrome. Permanent Erectile Syndrome? In order to make it down, he has slept with many women. But all the women have failed and had a seizure in the end. Unfortunately their body couldn't function as a woman after that. They should've reported to the police before the situation became serious like a seizure. But that's too good to miss. 500,000 yen just disappears in front you. 500,000 yen?! Let's celebrate the 150th branch launching of the great Sanemura Cosmetics. Let's raise our glasses, hoping the good health of President Kakuzo Saneura. Cheers! - Cheers! - Cheers! Thank you. Thank you. As much as we have to celebrate for the company's success, my son, Shinji, is going to graduate the university with an exceptional score. In the morning of the graduation day, I will announce him as my successor. So I want everybody to take care of my son. Hey, Shinji. You have only 3 years until you become 25. According to the rule of Saneura family, you have to get the name of Kakuzo from me when you become 25. Do not bring shame on the precious name, Kakuzo, which has been kept for many years. I don't want it! Shinji is good enough! Idiot! I was also ashamed of my name Kakuzo Saneura when I received the name. But... I am proud of it now. Hey, Hamachi. The soft-shell turtle geisha is late. Is she coming? It's about time... Oh! There she is! Who is the soft-shell turtle geisha everybody is talking about? Yes! I am! Asai! Sanekata! What? Sanekata? His name is Shinji Saneura. I am Kakuzo. Please stop talking, father! In my kindergarten, elementary school, middle school, and high school... Do you know how much I have struggled because of the name? Idiot! Sanekata! Is your real surname Saneura? I don't want to hear that name from you. Asai! Let's go! But... I have to do something with this soft-shell turtle geisha... Mr. President! Can I do that instead of her? I am a virgin. Miss, I know you are a fake virgin. The only reason I paid you was to make my penis shrink by that soft-shell turtle geisha. Mine is similar to soft-shell turtle. I am a daughter of a freshwater-tortoise-selling family business. What turtle? Right! We are turtles too, right? I will make your penis shrink. Wow, so hard! Asai! Marry me. Marriage? I love you to death. I don't want to lose you to someone else. It's not possible. You will become the successor of the company, right? I don't understand why a man like yourself wants to many a girl like me. When I was 5 years old, my father was enjoying too much with other women that my mother abandoned me and ran away. I don't know why. When I am with you, I feel like I am with my mother. I understand now. You don't have a mother. Yes. I am all alone. So, please marry me! Don't be a kid. As much as you have your own life, I have my own life too. Is it true that this is registered to the police? It has not been registered yet. If this does not shrink soon, it will be registered, I suppose. Mr. President! If I made this shrink, you would really pay me 500,000? Of course! I give you right away! I am going to make it shrink right away then! You said you are a real virgin! Yes. I am a virgin. - Virgin? - Virgin! Who do you want? I don't need one. But you bothered to come all the way down here for the first time in a while. That's disrespectful to a person like me. I have never wanted this kind of things. People should have a physical relationship after they achieve an emotional connection. Wow... you are such a... Ma'am, you are the same, aren't you? This is "Platonic Love." I think this is very important for the people in our generation. Okay... I give you my name card. Yosaburo Kimochi. Ma'am, it's me, Kimochi. The man who fell in love with you. Since we fell in love, the emotion and body should be in sync each other. Excuse me... Ma'am? You feel way smaller than before. Really... Ma'am! Who are you? You have no skills at all. My mother is over there. Kaoru, what happened? This man mistook me for mama and touched me. Ridiculous, isn't it? Mr. Kimochi! Ma'am! Please satisfy the emotion of Yosaburo Kimochi! What are you doing? Pull it together! We have to make our emotion and body in sync. No way! Honey, I will be your wife forever. I will continue to maintain my purity, keeping the memories of us and Kaoru. You can take a rest. Honey. Ah? It shrank... It doesn't come up again. Yeah! 500,000 yen! 6 years were too long to stay like this. This is one of the greatest achievements of my life of 57 years. I feel good for your achievement! Mr. President! Why don't you do a vasectomy? There are a few doctors who can do it. Let's make it impotent forever when it's down! You fool! Don't say unfortunate things on a day like this! Kimochi, what is this? This is the penis of a soft-shell turtle. The penis of a soft-shell turtle? Look closer. The tip has split into 9 ways, right? That's right. It's 9 ways. These 9 tips move freely. The female soft-shell turtles like them so much. That's an incredible thing. Open your mouth please. I kind of miss the days when it was up. Now it's just shrunken. I think a man's emotion is quite complex. 1,000,000? - 1,000,000 yen? - 1,000,000 yen? That's right! If you make his penis go up again, I will pay the reward of 1,000,000 yen. Mr. Kimochi! I am going do it! Me, I am going! I am going! You bitch! Stop it! Mr. Kimochi, you need my aggressive treatment. I will fix it up. Don't bother if you are just going to tighten him. I will do it with my wonderful lips and skills. What are you talking about? Bitches like you will be useless to fix Mr. President. I will do it instead of you bitches. Hey! Listen! I think I have to do it! I have done it once. Making it go up is different from making it go down! Keep complaining! I was the one who put it down, so I am going to make it go up. Don't be too proud of yourself! You are just a rookie here! You already got 500,000! You want another 1,000,000? Of course, who doesn't like money? Shut up, you freshwater tortoise bitch! 1,000,000? I will go then. Uh? You? Could you do it for me? Oh... Soft-shell... turtle... I feel like it's going up again... Oh... it's up! It's tightening! Soft-shell turtle is tightening... Soft-shell... This girl again? Wow, it's a pa... paradise. Doctor! If they stay like this... Nurse! Bring some anesthetics! It ran out. Why didn't you fill up before it ran out? You stupid! It's not thundering now. Help me. Let's split together. Do not split! It's a paradise! Paradise! Ah... my mind is fading away... fading... to somewhere... Natsuko Asai! You stupid! Stupid! Natsuko is stupid! You are still young... Mori! Women are always changing... I can't trust women anymore. There is a way to make her follow your lead. Look at me. I can totally dominate women because I have changed many women by myself. Why don't you come to my place and study with me? I want to teach you how to control women and what is the real deal of women. You are charming. I am going to adore you this time. Don't move! Ah! It's burning! Stupid! I told you to be careful with the poison! How dare you do that to the precious place of a woman? Hey, hey! Sorry, sorry! I know it's painful, but please don't jump like that! It will cause a nuclear explosion! The cathode will explode! Hmmm... it looks severe... It is burning totally black... I think you cannot function as a woman anymore. Stop it! I don't care if it breaks. Just put something and fix it... But... I am shocked! I never knew Saneura would work at Body Makeover Lab. Maybe he lost his mind because of Natsuko! He lost his mind as a virgin? Is he a virgin? Natsuko is some woman, right? He will change after this enlightenment. He is young. Anyway, he is the one who is going to be the president of the company. If you seduce him when he is crazy, you will become a wife of the president. A wife of the president? Mister, fuck me! Wh... what are you doing? I can't help my love for you. You slept with my father. But my love is for you. I have been struggling recently. Shinji! Fuck me! No way! You haven't slept with anyone, right? My body is... How dare you do this to your superior? What are you talking about? The one who gets him first is the winner. Mister, I am way better than this dirty bitch! - I want to be free from women! - Please marry me! Wait!!! Hey, Soft-shell Turtle Kurajiro! - Kurajiro! - You retard! - Kurajiro! - Stupid Kurajiro! - Smells like a soft-shell turtle! Kurajiro! - Shut up! Stop it! Stop it! Run! Run! Mr. Kura! Mr. Kura. Please leave this town! Miss... This is not much. But I want you to start a new life with this money. I can't help it anymore. You have treated me with your heart and kindness since when I was young. I can't see you being treated as a crazy person. Miss... I cannot leave this town. I will find the soft-shell turtles whatever it takes. I don't care if I become weaker and weaker. I will protect the symbol of Maruasa, which has been doing business since the Edo era. What symbol? Why do you have to sacrifice your body in order to protect the symbol? That kind of mindset is very old-fashioned. I don't care if it's old-fashioned. I saw the symbol of Maruasa for the first time after the burndown, I still remember it clearly. It was shinier than the sun. The Natsuko who will never change. It's a Dutch wife. The Natsuko in reality changes gradually. The Natsuko who will never change. I am going to make it. Mister. Mama... Mama... Ah? Natsuko! Ayako? You have someone you like? No. I knew that you have been circling 100 times at the temple every day. There is a man I am looking for. I really want to see him. He is called Women-Hunter Danpei. Women-Hunter Danpei? About 5 years ago... my mother was running a small restaurant in Izu. Danpei dropped by the shop and played her. And she became a sex addict. In the end, she died in a mental hospital I will definitely find Women-Hunter Danpei! In order to keep maximizing the sexual energy during peacetime, we always have to observe other people. Listen! Yes, sir! Well... is this a tree of the ocean? This is a small one. Pine trees... And another one... And a bamboo shape... Idiot! Are you wasting your energy on a stupid painter? Come here! Idiot! Look for female waists! - Yes, sir! - Good. Yokoyama... Are you Yokoyama? - Mori! Are you Mori? - It is Yokoyama! Long time no see. Nothing has changed. You too. You look younger. Really? It feels unreal that we were wandering as soldiers in the jungle of Guam after we lost the battle. That's right! Who is this? How rude! My comrade during the war! Easy, easy. We were just teenage boys during that time. We used to say we would die for the country and the emperor. It's been 27 years since then. It feels so unreal. We would eat meals with girls next to us. I never knew the rumored Women-Hunter Danpei would be you. I tell you. I threw away the name of Yokoyama in the jungle of Guam! After we lost the war, I came back. My sister and even my first love sat next to American soldiers and laughed with them, wearing brightly red lipstick. I concluded that this was the fate of Japanese women. Hey, Yokoyama. You used to imitate "Underwear Man" in front of me. I was so into that. I was still a virgin at 18 at that time. And now I have had a lot of sex with American women. You lost your first love too, right?! I know that feeling. You felt bad about yourself and started making over Japanese women into foreigners. No, no, no. I am actually grateful about the experience. My motto is there is no border nor race in sex. It's very hard to solve this problem. Basically we are the world citizen and the citizen of the earth. The hair color and eye color are just looks. Hey, Yokoyama! I have been trying hard to tell those girls this truth. Those girls are the geishas of the Kiyosaki hot-spring. There is a girl I want to make over whatever it takes. Ah! Good! Mori! Do this with me. - With you? - I beg you. My pupils and I will make those girls into sex addicts, and you can make them into foreign girls. - Yokoyama. - Friend! Those girls will become non-Japanese girls. Ah... ah... that face and that voice... my wife and children who are waiting for our accomplishments... The School of Unlimited Semen, Watari Sado The School of Unlimited Semen, Aefuki Doji The School of Unlimited Semen, Maki Tetsuka Lesson 1. Walking. Listen! You not only have to control your body but also the mind and emotion. You have to become non-Japanese as fast as possible. Walking Start! More movement! Shake your asses! Don't forget your basic movement. Front, front, side, side, make a circle, finish! Lesson 2 Position Lesson 2. The manner on the bed. I am talking about your position. Start! Excuse me... Wait! Wait! Wait! No, no, no! There is no originality. You can't use the missionary! They have no protection on their arms. If you push her with your weight, her ass will become tired. Tu|11 back! Doggy style! Foul! You can't massage her breast that strong. She will become tired. Lesson 3 Theory Lesson 3. The theory... are not only studying a body makeover, but also the shapes of hair. Some of them are quite long. Idiot! You talk too much! If you like to become the best in the school, this is common sense. Doctor! This one looks quite short. Just like your penis. Shut up! Be silence! - Cool! - Thank you! This one is called the Short type. Only the tip is extended a bit. Once it is stuck to it, it never gets off from it. So a bit challenging when you finished. This one is called New Hair. It has quite a lot of movements. This is the best shape among all hair shapes. If you want to be the best in sex, this is the shape. Doctor! This is a jungle? Idiot! This is not a jungle. This is called the Long type. Only one in a million. Listen! At the moment, the only man who can make this is myself, Takamaru Mori, who has graduated Tokyo University. It is the most sophisticated one which moves through just like an electric eel and attract men. The best in Japan! We are quite busy too. But Women-Hunter Danpei took 3 girls from us! We lost 2 girls! We lost Tsurumaru, Kiyoha, Hanachio, and Sadoyakko. Right? Mr. Nakazawa! Can you make Women-Hunter Danpei go away with a police report? Even the military cannot deal with him, not to mention the police. He has been doing this for a long time. He can do anything on the girls when they don't have debts. This is a very difficult situation. We have to do something to save the girls. Every hot-spring village has collapsed after Women-Hunter Danpei swept it. Women-Hunter Danpei. Yes. This is Women-Hunter Danpei. What? Ayako Hanamura? The daughter of Funako Hanamura? She has such a sweet heart that she wants to revenge her mother on me. I am going to be waiting at the Sanin stadium. Women-Hunter Danpei! I've been waiting for you! You're digging your own grave! That's why I accepted this battle. Show me your skills! What? Daughter follows mother. You're already mine. I am going to revenge my mother! Come on! First gear! Second gear! Third gear! Can you get up at the third gear? I can do everything! You will pass out too in the end. Fourth gear! Fifth gear! Sixth gear! Seventh gear! Eighth gear! Ninth gear! The Ladder Child gear! Mother! The school of Unlimited Semen! The Ladder Child gear! The School of Unlimited Semen, Ladder Child Gear Mr. Danpei! Mr. Danpei! Don't go away from Ayako! Extremely scary! Women-Hunter Danpei! What is this? Very hard to look at! I am going to beat Danpei! I will wipe him out from this village before tomorrow comes. Wa... wait! He is too strong to be beaten by a woman! No, I am okay! I have never touched a man since my husband died. - You are Women-Hunter Danpei? - Yes. Stop stealing girls by making them sexually addicted to you from today. Your body has never touched a man for 8 years. The blood is festering. Whatever you do, I won't have two men in my life. Okay then. What are you doing? Oh? I can't! Don't come near me! What are you going to do to me? I am going to kill myself! The school of Unlimited Semen, Widow Killer! No, I can't do that in this embarrassing position. My husband... Husband... Ah! Better than my husband!!! Hey, wasn't your mission to get back the geishas? I don't care! I am going crazy. Tomiko! I am going crazy! Tomiko! Don't go away from me! The School of Unlimited Semen, Widow Killer Oh! My darling, Danpei! Mr. Danpei! I am so happy! Please don't leave me alone! Don't leave me alone. Grab this hand firmly and never let it go! Danpei! Why does she ooze that much?! Doesn't matter how much I wipe, it gets wet right away. She hasn't slept with any man for a long time. So I have touched her a little. Too much... However, you know, it is still not enough to make the girl named Natsuko into a foreigner. That's right. Doesn't matter how many girls you make over, you will not make money. Danpei will achieve your goal for you. The promise. Natsuko Asai, the soft-shell turtle geisha, responds to the challenge of the founder of the school of Unlimited Semen. If she totally defeats him, he promises to do the following. First. Women-Hunter Danpei pays 10,000,000 yen to Natsuko Asai. Second, he returns the stolen girls. That's all. Asai! Please! Please responds to this challenge. If you defeat him, the tourism association will pay you 2,000,000 yen. 2,000,000 yen? Wait, wait! Emergency! Emergency! What's up? The Yokomi hot-spring's mama has been transformed into a foreigner. Foreigner? That's right! She dyed her hair blonde at her age and is walking on the street right next to Danpei, shaking her ass. Mama has become a foreigner? Sis! Please take my mama back! Please! Take my mama back! You heard it, Natsuko! Yokomi's mama is not only taking care of you but also had been taking care of your sister. Please do it for this kid at least! Stop! Stop it! Whatever you say to me, how much money you give. I don't want to do it! I want to live for myself! I have already paid the debt back. I will quit geisha after today's work. I made it! Finally made it! The Natsuko who will never change! My youth Natsuko! Natsuko!! Stop! Yoko?! You were here? What? What are you doing? What are you doing?! Yoko! What is this? When are you going to stop being obsessed with this thing? You can't see your Yoko because of this kind of stuff? Look at me. The blood is flowing inside of my body. The blood says that I love you so much. The blood says that I want to have your baby. Yoko! Will you stay besides me forever? You stupid! You are so stupid! Of course! Yoko! Yoko! Mr. Kura! Mr. Kura! What are you doing? Don't be stupid! Get out of here please! What are you talking about? I have searched every stream around here. I have found only one mud turtle. Stupid! You are the one who said you would never let things go and in order to find a soft-shell turtle, you would become stronger than a soft-shell turtle! I woke up from my dream. Once you woke up from your dream, there is nothing much to do in your life! Mr. Kura! Wait! Wait! Mr. Kura! Coward! Coward! Coward! Stop! Mr. Kura! Stop it! Stop! Stop! Natsuko! Finally you don't call me "Miss." I have had a feeling for you for a long time. I couldn't say it. Couldn't say it. Are you going to live on for me? I am glad. Soft-shell turtle! Soft-shell turtle! I knew that they would come. They exist! They exist!! My dream was real!!! Mr. Kura! Your wish has come true! I can repay his kindness. I can make a small restaurant. The symbol of Maruasa. The symbol of Maruasa... I will help you achieve your dream besides you. I am going to do a battle with Women-Hunter Danpei. You came, Natsuko! I have been waiting for this day! If I win the battle, you will give me 10,000,000 yen, return the stolen geishas and leave the town. You are going to keep this promise? The school of Unlimited Semen does not teach lies. Ready! Ready! Ready... Go! Got her! Got her! Got her! Got her! This is intense! Uh? What? Shit! She raised her ass! She made a women-on-top position! Let me off! Let me off... I can't let you win! I... can only hear up to the second attack! That ass movement! More defense! It sucks so deep! Sucks so deep! I can't make it go! I can...! It goes to the limit! That breast! That hand! I won't forgive you! I won't forgive you! Danpei! Don't open her! Wait until you get deeper and bum all over! Teacher! Teacher! Start the magic of the soft-shell turtle killer! Do you like the thunder? I can see the end! Hey, the soft-shell turtle is getting impacted by the thunder! Yea. Danpei! You even survived the jungle of Guam. You can't lose to a woman born after the war! Danpei! Ah... ah... that face... that voice... T... thank you!!! ...the wife and children are waiting for our accomplishments... the skin has become about to tear off... only the cloud faraway floats again... attack! Wish A Great Victory for Danpei Yokoyama Ah... with the blessing of the Okimi god... the death is a graceful thing for soldiers... The school of Unlimited Semen! 1,000 invasions! The School of Unlimited Semen! 1,000 Invasions Na... Na... Natsuko! I don't know! I don't know at all! Natsuko gave this money to you. Natsuko? Anyway read this letter please. Kurajiro, I won't forget the memories we had at the river. I was able to understand the importance of the consistent attitude in our lives. I am leaving in order to find the new side of myself. I hope the memories make you find the new side of yourself too. Good-bye! The End
