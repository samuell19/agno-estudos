The darkness calls to you. Give me a helper to carry out what was intended. Oh! Gotcha? We're getting married tomorrow, I hope I don't have to run after every kiss. E! Pinocchio, well, do not peep. So, donut, where are the wedding doves? What doves? That's not mine. It turns out that wings will grow at the hut? Cool! It will be possible to stir up the airline "Grandma Airlines". If you call names, I'll pour this potion on you. And we will fly right to the hut from the wedding. And then! This is my present to you. Hear. Pah you! Looks like you messed up something. Not bad. Good for small aircraft. Where are you running around again? Where! I caught fish for the wedding feast. Come on, to the cart. What's up, Wan? Have you changed your mind about getting married? I'm going to stick my tail in someone's gills! Oh oh oh! You won't change your mind with this one. People are getting married. And you are a tailed bubble ... You just have to scoff. When will you take me down the aisle? My berry, well, where should we hurry with you? Let's hug each other. Let's wait a hundred years. Wan, I came up with the idea to launch into the sky instead of doves. Well? In! Wow! Some kind of witchcraft again? Ordinary butterfly. And giant powder. Haven't heard of this one? - Not. - Here. Krutyamba! Vasilisa will love it. Vanya, Vanya! Vanya !!! Van! It seems I've scolded the giant's powder somewhere. Vasilisa, get people out of the square! Strike. Dear Belogorsk and Belogorsk people! Disinfection carried out, you can return to your usual activities. Maybe not so fast. Jet Lord, help needed! Oops! Medusa in my mouth. Vasilisa! Throw it on me. Hey, three-headed stove! I'm here! Aren't you ashamed, pterodactyl unfinished? Vanya! Darkness is near! Oh trouble, trouble. Now I've heard it! Listen, that's enough, huh? Purely our situation, to cover our jamb with a universal conspiracy. What's wrong? BUT? Destroyed everything. It took a long time to make soup out of it. Well, how are we going to play the wedding tomorrow? That is OK. We'll fix it by tomorrow. Is there enough food for all the guests? Everyone has enough. Go to bed tomorrow is an important day. How can you sleep here? So it's all exciting. Everything will be fine. Gentle wind caressed you Nose and ears touched lovingly. Close your eyes. Sleep comes to you. You hear a fabulous sound in the distance. Beautiful song. We will sing it to our children. And how do you know her? Never thought about it. I do not remember. Probably since childhood. Maybe my mom sang it to me. Mmm. Sweet dream, sweet dream. Let him dream about you. Vania! Trouble is coming. I smell the darkness, oh I smell it. - Exactly! - Yeah! But I’ve been telling the groom for the second month that he’s carrying manure from the stable. No laughing matter now, Vanya. Darkness is near! We need to gather an army! Don't vibrate grandpa. Rogaleb won, Galina will not come here. Be afraid. Did you see a lizard today? .. One left. The maximum that can happen is that you will blow some powder again. Go to sleep. Ivan. Are you kidding me or what? Why you do not sleep? A. You don't sleep at all. Oh, what a trucker the country has lost! Well, are you ready to have fun at the wedding tomorrow? Or are you going to scare our guests with your sour face? More importantly, are you ready? I think it's ready. To be honest, I've never been so sure. Very well. At the right time to make the right choice, oh how important. Ltd… I know this face. I made the wrong choice in life, I really want to talk about it, but I won’t. Before. Well, before all this heroism, at such moments I took money out of people. And now, as a friend, advice to you. Tell me, it will get easier. Obviously, you have been wearing it for a long time. About how I gained my immortality, you know. And what happened on the shore of the black lake, I had never told anyone before. When I came to the lake, something strange happened to me. As if I was divided inside, and began to argue with myself. The darkness in me told me that there was only one way, that this was the only way it had to be. And the Light resisted, they say it's wrong, and this choice will make me unhappy. And when the Light had already almost won, I suddenly realized that I had never been happy. And such a resentment seized me for myself, for my hard fate, my orphan life. And since then, dark times have come in Belogorye. And for a thousand years the thought has not left me. And suddenly it could be otherwise. Maybe then I would have lived a short but happy life, and not brought so much evil. If you think about it, then you still have a choice. Only others - whether you be happy or not. Okay, think. Time to sleep. And then tomorrow, half asleep, I’ll marry Baba Yaga. Oh really. - Ivan. - Ah! [Snoring] Let her go! I speak well. And when you already calm down old. - Eee! - Stand! - What happened? - Vasilisa was kidnapped. - Who? - Our old friend. - You have to catch up! - What stood a stake? - The toad is gone! - Have you forgotten me? Come on, baby, push it! Leaving! Have you seen? This! Black! Here is strength! What's black? Galya is not one or what? The darkness filled her. She is now stronger than ever. Throw something at her. What are you, empty-headed Gavriks. See how it shakes. Suddenly you will fall into Vasilisa. Pull up grandma! Leaving! High. Do not jump like that ... turtledove. Pull this one. With all my might. What kind of kingdom-state is this? Welcome to Moscow! (Welcome to Moscow!) Capital of Russian Federation. (Capital of Russian Federation.) Ivan has been bewitched! We will never understand him now. Get it, cracker. This is a foreign language. What's in the bag? Walnuts. Round, come here. Well, go away! Du-u-ui! - Svyatozar !!! - Ah! - Reload! - BUT! - Give me nuts! - Yeah. The witch is losing her powers! Granny pull up. Don't you dare, old lady, then we'll pick up Vanya. You do not notice anything that is happening on the road ... Like he notices everything. Hey, black-faced gudgeon spilled the floor of the mortar for me. - Where's she? - Dashed in there. Hey! Svyatozar. Vasilisa! Where's she? She couldn't go anywhere from here. You saw that Galina began to weaken! Grandma, honey, let's do something. Get some goat-grass. Svetozar you're a wizard, let's conjure something. Turn into a dog, take a trace. You can. Well! No Vanya. I don't hear her. They seem to be far away. What's this? It looks like the feather of the Firebird. So what? The Firebird could help Galina. Why are you talking, tyuryuhailo? Kashchei has long destroyed all the Firebirds. Not! Many of the magical creatures in this world took refuge in dark times. And what do you know where to look for this Firebird? How you were crushed! Hey, stump Koshcheev! Are you alive there? Alive! Where are we? Boat what? That's why my grandmother and grandfather baked me? They found it in torment. Eternals. Wait here, I am now. Forgot yours again! Well, what a tourist went. Dear. Let's get up. Rise, rise, rise! There is a river everywhere. Don't get out. You need to find a helmsman to land on the shore. O! And here is the steering wheel. Frightened the man of the fear-man. Well, yes. Now… No, guess what. He himself licks the plate after scrambled eggs. And he also tells me that I am raising Igorka incorrectly. Fine? Hey, you're talking to me. Ay. I told him so, of course. Hey, are you deaf? Oh, listen, what's the point. One hundred years already... Aw, fool. Hey man, wake up. Come on dear. Everything is because of you. How are we going to get to the shore? How to find Ivan? Your stump. bad? BUT? Well, what are you waving your little hands? Yes, so we will not agree. It means, if yes, jump up, if not, sit down. Understood? But who is there, Ivan? And who then? What's your head there? It's clear. Probably, where your head is, there the rest. So let's go look for her. Well, what are you talking about, stump. We would somehow go ashore, but here the water is all around. See? I'll get wet, like ... Ah-ah-ah! O. What did you miss? Don't be sad bubble. Now let's grab the Firebird by the tail and find out everything. We lost Koshchei and Kolobok. One is immortal, the other is bread. They won't disappear. Vasilisa needs to be found. What got up? Shut up. Go! Grandma, are you gathered in a hut in Moscow or something to roam? - A what? - Nothing. Like normal people, let's go on a magical yellow chariot. And my dove? Let him hide somewhere. Just sit down and don't make noise. The main thing is that it is not demolished under the renovation program. Yes. Have you arrived? We leave. - Let's go! - Go. Our chariot has arrived. Yes, he does not pay attention to me at all! He is on his phone all the time. Igorek! A gift for you, take it in your bag. What are you talking about? Child, let me go. What are you doing? Lift me up. Cool! King of the White Walkers! What are you carrying a child. Come on quickly... Mom, thanks! You're the best! Yes, this is, along the way, Igorka. liked the pencils. I always tell mine, kids don't need any gadgets. If you do that again, I'll tear off your stumps. Understood? Well. Where are we? Hey you. Let me climb on you, I'll tell you where to go. What's not? What-no head you will have. There are legs - you don't need a mind. Are you going to hang around for a long time? Hey you little ones! I'm kicking you now. Run brother. You are free. Ugh! Blank. I wish I could close up such shutters in my turtledove! Relatives from Kostroma came to Moscow to see. - What are you talking about? - Van. Toko it. Take it easy with the Firebird. They are capricious and touchy birds. If you don’t like something, we won’t agree in life. Here cunning, flattery is necessary. There is no cashier. He would have pulled this bird by the tail, he would have talked in an instant. Yes, Kashchei would help us. And you tell him on this tablet speaking. How can I talk to him? He doesn't have that board. And we will fix this now. O! Open the window! - I saw it. - O! The board has flown. Was Vasilisa not allowed to send such a board? No. I don't hear her. Therefore, the bird will not find it either. How can I call now? - Sell the phone. And? - Is not. Why not, huh? Tyuryuhailo! Sell ​​it. And then I'll eat it. We need to move from economy to comfort. How restless you are. No luck with you Vanechka. In vain you started all this. Vanya will tear your head off for me! For you? - Who are you to him? - I am the closest person to him. It's clear? Yes !? Closer to mother? How? Why didn't you tell him, he was looking for you? He wasn't ready yet. Everything has its time. So. So, so... It's... What's it? Shy. Drive her away, you bastard. The food nearly ate me up. Well, what is there? Far more? So we'll be stale by the time we get there. We need such a thing. Ivan rode it in Belogorye. Not understood! Eh, what are you? I need your iron horse. Go away, bearded woman! If you do that again, I'll bite your nose off. - Show me how to ride it. - Yes. Not. It's better in a mortar. Is this the Firebird's nest? The bird lives curly. Hello, honey! Hello. We lay out metal objects on the table. And we pass through the frame. Hey! Where!? What's wrong! Stand! Stand! First, first, penetration! First, we have penetration here. Enough, child. Well, what are you doing? Well enough! Enough! I will wipe out your entire family! Where is your button? Let me go, I'll say goodbye. I need Ivan. He can't cope without me. Hey kid, where did you go? Let there be light! You will answer me for everything! Igorek, go to dinner. Mistress, listen to me. Hang a little more. I command you! Take me to Ivan Muromets! And if you do not obey, I will flog you and your foolish servant. Clear!? Horrible! Cool, right? Click on the nose. Aw! If you touch me again, I'll bite off my finger. God! How much did your dad buy Chinese nonsense! Luke, I am your father! Vladyka Koschey speaks to you. If you don't help me, I'll punish you! - So! I don't like this toy. I'm throwing it out. - Mother! Not! - Don't argue with me! - Woman! Hello, are you still here? Yes, my again Igorka, bought some nonsense! Woman, stop! So, where is the bird? Wow! Who did they bring? I said don't come in! Who else are you? What is this, Kirkorov? Well, that explains a lot. Hey Lena! Lena! Strangers! Who let them in here? How did you get here? BUT? How did you get here? We've come to talk! How are you there? Philip Zhar-ptitsevich? I don't want to talk to anyone! Get out of here! - Drive them away, Lena! - We're leaving. - Leave! - What are you talking about, turkey? Everything is quiet! Firebird! Didn't recognize? It's me, Svetozar! - Svetozar? - Yes! Oh… Indeed, Svetozar. Didn't acknowledge. You will be rich, Svetozar. And what kind of peasant is uncouth with you? Forgive him, he is young. - BUT? - This is our hero. Ivan Muromets. Elijah's son. - The son of Ilya Muromets? "Listen. - Hmm. His father was textured. And this one... Ugly. Yes!? Yes Yes Yes! Ugly! Terrible. Fu, fu. Nekra... OK. Why did you complain? There are no extra tickets for the concert! We have a case for you, swan. They stole Ivan's bride in Belogorye, but they transferred it here. We don't know where to look for it. Your Belogorsk affairs have not interested me for a long time. And in general ... Maybe it was not stolen? And she herself ran away ... from this. Hey you? Goose... skinned! Give it to me! We found your pen at the crime scene. - Vania! - Tell me, where is Vasilisa? Or I'll rip your tail off! - Vania! Why is he talking to me like that? He scares me! And anyway, who are they? Yes, I scatter thousands of these feathers during concerts. Well, let's get out of here! I don't know and I don't want to know! Do you understand? Lena! Lena! Began! Carry a nest! Carry a nest! The Firebird brings an egg into the world. It only happens once in their lives. And it's not an easy egg. It has great value. Gives an answer to any question. Therefore, they hide the egg from greedy human eyes. - Generally on any? - Yes. Now I've seen everything! - Looks like me? - Yes! - Yes? - Yes. "Insane." "Copies!" You are my favorite! Your magnificence rehearsal has begun. It's time for you to get on stage. I won't go anywhere! Not before me now! We have a full house today. The governor will. Hide! Well, what are you digging? Bring the grain! Are you here now? I said I don't know anything. Get out of here! - Vanka! Need to go. - Wait. We need this egg. What are you, forget about it! They will burn you! What is it you ate, swan? What is not clear? The grains of man-turning! Grains... Human-turning... Let's change. You are my seed. And I to you... - What? I scale mine? - Not. Here! Look! Bald beaver. Brilliant! And he didn’t give me anything, except crucian carp. Mm! Lena! Give him grain. A little bit. Wow! I have grown tentacles... legs. Beauties. Now I have legs too. True, not as long as yours, but ... nothing too! Yes? O! Granny! Now your crucian will swim away. Hide your claws, shameless accursed! Hide I say! My fish! But I haven't done anything yet. I know your "didn't do anything". And without legs he told me to leave. And with legs, and even more so! What hatched? There are no men of your own, so stare at someone else! Get out! Get out of here! I'm old, now I'll turn you into a coal! Get out of here! Well, she's gone! We're leaving. We're leaving. How do you walk on these sticks? BUT! Listen, seal. Shut up because of you we almost burned all of us. Everything, everything. Good dogging. You are great, you did a good job. - Hide. - You stole it? This is not good, Vanya! It would be necessary to return. Come on, these chickens will still be demolished. Hide, hide! They will find out the loss and pull out all my legs. Wow! You'll regret it, you wretch! - Hello. I will destroy you and your entire tribe! Shut up already! Hello girl. What are you carrying in the katomak? I throw out the trash. Why so long? What is this, bread? Never throw away bread! Understood? She doesn't understand anything. She drives the cart like crazy and talks to herself. BUT! It's clear. Holy fool. Let's go look for Ivan. - Tora! What to do with him? Oh, Vanya, Vanya, Vanya! You need to open it. I heard that each egg has its own approach. Everyone has a special secret. Your approach? Well, hold on! Got it. Oh! Oh! Moms! Che! What hurts so much? It wasn't like that before. Well, now it will definitely work. They told you, balaboshka, they told you! Here a special approach is needed. You don't listen to smart people. Listen to a smart person! Uma, like a lamb's droppings. Here's one. Vania! Vanya, look what shoes I found on you! How do you walk in them? Yes. If Koschey were here, he would suggest how to open the egg. The subscriber is temporarily unavailable. Please, call later. Your bird didn't fly. - It went hard. - All right, let's go. And then the rotten water will end in the iron horse. Are you leaving, daughter? You don't even drink tea. Do not want. Decided to take a walk. Could you say goodbye? Somehow impolite. - Maybe it needs to be boiled. - Nope. What a beauty! Did you drool? What did I loose. I'm wondering how to open an egg. - Give me a tyrkalka. - Here, take it. Hello. And you are stubborn! Even though it's cute. We could make friends. I am not friendly with snakes. Y! A. Ah! What have you done, old witch! My eyes popped! This light is cut down, now they will turn it on. People, here the inscription appeared. I will open tomorrow. Red-winged birds! Well, you couldn't tell? Tomorrow is still two hours away. Let's wait. My mouth is dry! Go out and drink some water from the white well. Go, go! Go drink. Ay! La-la-lay. Van, can you make this colored wall again? Let's go, I'll give you at least normal clothes. - Che! - Go get changed! Not! It's time. Come on, dear! It's not an egg! Is this some kind of scammer? I will open tomorrow. And we tried to open it again today. It will only open tomorrow! Yes? And when tomorrow comes, it will turn into today again! How are we going to open it tomorrow? This is some nonsense! Stop thinking. Need to do something! Vasilisa must be saved! Where to look for it? I don't know where to look! Everywhere! Golden ray of sunshine the darkness was covered with a veil. And between us again suddenly there was a wall. The night will pass, the morning will come clear I know happiness awaits us with you. The night will pass, the rainy season will pass. The sun will rise. The birds will stop singing. You touched the light of the stars. Through blizzards and sorrows you hear my voice! The night will pass and the morning will come. I believe happiness awaits us with you ... No matter what you conjure, nothing will come of you. Vanya will save me anyway. Believe me, honey, I really want this too. For him to save you. The sun will rise... You need to save those you love. Soup. Oh Yaga! How to live with you! From your soup all the gills reduce! Stunned! "What?" - Ostolben. - Ouch! - It's an aging decoction. - To have an egg tomorrow. - FAQ? Aging Decoction! - Ah. Oh! - Ah! - Ah! - Ah! - You are a witch! Oh! What is it that I am now seven hundred years old? I am older than you? Don't worry, it won't be long. Svetozar! Get the egg. Say it's ready. Yes? Fu! Run Run. Oops! Oh! On! - You fool! - What? - What did you do? - Ah... You... I'm going now. Mm! Fin hurt. Ay! My little fishes! Let me introduce myself! Shameless crucian! Well, you berry start again? Well, I'm just looking for an egg! Or maybe they saw an egg? Looking for adventure on your tail! Here is an egg. Why are you all staring at them? Yaga, listen, calm down, you're already tired, really! Am I tired? Yes, you are tired! Leaking me! Flowing, flowing, flowing! I will soon have a hollow in my head from you! Right now, it will appear in your head! Come on, clean up your bony little hands! Ah, how you spoke! What, am I, a fool, in vain believed you? Appointed in narrowed! In vain! Six hundred years there is no mind and never will be. I don't want to see you! - O! Little loss. - To Babylon to their kikimors. I ... Kikimory. Touch me again. Galya! Only you were missing. Don't mess with me or you'll regret it! I spoke! At least they did some good. It's his own fault, he doesn't know the rules at all! People. This black guy just attacked me! Vania! We know how to open an egg! The waterman came up with. Yes! I remembered about kikimors here. To remember without me? You are an empty minnow! Listen to grandma! Stop muddying the water! I don't know you at all. - What are you, mold... - Oh! - Swamp mold! - Stop! Swamp mold. - What kind of kikimora? - Kikimors are subject to time. They may know how to get us into tomorrow. These kikimoras are yours... Do they also live here? Am I understanding you correctly? They were expelled from Belogorye because they stole time from people. Understood. Yeah. We're going to the kikimors. Who is interested? Buzova and Sobchak or what? Why switch to comfort? This cart will be better. The birds here, of course, are filthy. And why did I eat this titmouse? I'm sick, Koshcheyushka! I'm dying. [Phone rings] - Oh-oh-oh! Still chirping inside. Kha! Khe! Kha! Oh! - Ivan!? - Koshchey where are you? Vania! And we are looking for you everywhere! Iron horse, out, saddled! Where are you? Mozhaysky Val, 8. This is the address. Well, ask someone. Let me know, find it. Everything. Here. Lair kikimore. Yeah. Time is stolen. Well, the place. Svetozar! Vasilisa! How are you here? We are looking for you everywhere! I managed to escape. I can smell the darkness! Let's go soon! You better be with me. Well, where are these kikimoras of yours? So there they are! Won. Look, Van, see? This is human time. His kikimoras are stolen and then hidden in a magic crystal. And how can they help us? An egg in a parcel post tomorrow, will they send it? If they are somehow managed over time, then they can help us. Hold on. I'll go make a deal. Sorry. Good afternoon! Young man, take a ticket. No, you did not understand. I just ask. Coupon! Dear, the device is not working. Elena Petrovna, our apparatus is not working. And I know. I turned on the kettle. Who can't wait there? Let them wait. Well, did you hear? Wait! The kettle will boil, the device will be connected. Take a ticket. Come up. What can't you see, everyone is waiting? Hey! Kikimora! Don't talk to me about teeth. Why are you yelling at me? Did I not understand? We are completely closed! We're having lunch! Wan! Wan! Well Wan! Well... Well... Well, why are you so pissed off! BUT! Vanya! Wan-Wan-Wan-Wan! Van, don't, don't. How to get to tomorrow? And we don't know anything, we just keep the crystal. Show me where he is. Well. Square, hero, I beg you! Do not do that! We have worked for hundreds of years to fill this crystal. How are we? How do you say live without it? BUT? Don't lose! I beg you, do not lose! We can't live without him! We take people very little time. We need to eat something, you know! Well, don't do it, Vanechka, please don't! Don't, Van. It's getting dark already, what the hell? How dare you? Give back the egg, thief! What are you watching? Burn them! Hey feathery! Stop it. On whom did they fluff their feathers? Forgot who I am? Do not destroy the immortal! We give up. Fly while you're safe. All in the nest. Why did you let them go? I didn't have lunch. Well, how are you here? Ha! Kitty, look in! Legs! O! He has legs. Ivan got the egg of the Firebird. We need to open it. It will help Vasilisa find. What would you do without me? So what to do... with this time crystal? Come on, give it here. Let's. Let there be light! Koscheyushka prayed! So what? Are you saying you cut a hole in tomorrow? Sui tuda. Love, love. There is! The testicle opened, what next? Ask! Wait, Van, don't rush, think. We can fix it. It is important to ask the right question. Where is Vasilisa? - I'm after him! - And Svetozar? I don’t know, Vasilisa needs to be saved! No, it's okay, he swam! And how are we? Yaga, where is your turtledove? Come on, come on, move! This is Che, the twelfth left. Galya! And you shoot worse than you clean! Gal! Well, after all, like an adult! And you run around Moscow on a dog! Like this! Well, we must save Ivan! How are we going to save him from here? - Hold on. Ripe! That's it, Gal, let's go down. You give me Vasilisa, and I, so be it, will let you go on all four sides! How are you? Didn't you take your buns? Not! But I suggest someone to recapture them! Let's see how this witch sings now! Flip the hut! Yes, calm down! Walled up! What are we to do now, Yaga? Remove the spell from my turtledove. Hold on. Wan! Vasilisa! "Vasilisa!" "Wan!" All is well, all is well. I'm here. I'm here. Everything is fine. Well, everything. Well, everything. Everything is fine. It's all right, do you hear? Vasilisa. Please. Not-e-et! Vanyush! Wan! This is all sorcery. I don't... Svetozar! Don't blame yourself, Van. That's all she is. Don't let yourself... You cannot kill me. Sweet Dreams… Sweet Dreams… Let him dream about you. Sweet Dreams… Sweet Dreams… Ma! How long have I been waiting for this moment. Forgive me, Vanyusha, that I did not confess earlier. But you weren't ready. And would reject me. Now we are together. You are not alone. Do you have a family. Finally, the world got a worthy ruler. Son, that's life. Everything great has a price to pay. I know it's hard for you to accept. But believe me, everything I did, I did for you. Darkness has chosen you for great things. She has been with you since you were born. They tried to interfere with us and separated us. Vanya! Don't take it! Vania! Vanya! Let go! Vanya! Vanya! Please don't take it! Not! You were hidden in another world. But I found you. I nurtured your dark side. Because that's the only way you can get stronger. Every year you were filled with Darkness. She grew up in you. But the Light within you began to resist. Then I realized that I needed to act more decisively. By stealing Vasilisa, I removed your doubts. Now you were ready for anything. From that moment on, you were where I wanted to be. And did what needed to be done. A few steps separated you from the total Darkness. By stealing the egg, you doomed the Firebird to eternal suffering. Only once in her life could she have a child. But you took it away. You brought destruction and famine to Kikimoras. All I had to do was fill you to the brim with malice and anger. For you to cross the line! Killed! Son, now no one in the world can interfere. Well, what's ready? Done. Hold on. That's it! Eee! Vasilisa! Not all of her life is gone. - Living water remained? - A bit left. What are you? Where is Vanya? Van, don't resist the Darkness. Let her in. Everything has already happened. There is no way back. Get away from him, witch! Vanya, what's wrong with you? The evil in me wins. I am changing. I'm sorry. Wan! Vanya! Wan! Don't give up! Fight, Vanya! Vanya! - Alive! - Yes. You need to be saved! It can't be stopped! We won't go anywhere without you. It's clear. Vanya! Wan! Wan! And have I been forgotten? Forgive me, Vanya. We can't beat her. This is only my fault. Do not turn then to the Darkness, this would not have happened. If we have a time crystal, so we can go anywhere. Even into the past. I know where you need to go. To where it all began. Bubble! Sword! Sailed. Oh, you dried vobla! Dove! Forgive me, fool! Get up! Get up, bighead. We will now drag you to the hut, and then we will drag you to the water. Get up! Get up! On! Do not play a wedding with you. My berry! Koschey! Or like you. Mikula. O! Where are you from here? - You can't change the past. - Yah! And who will stop me? Are you a gorilla? You didn't understand anything? I am you. I have always been with you, since childhood. Your fear is me! Your rage is me! Your pride is me too! You are doomed! You can't kill me! I am part of you! Submit to Darkness. Wait! So everything that is happening right now is happening in my head. Therefore, you have no choice. No, buddy, you don't have a choice. You are in my head! You can handle the anvil. I own my own head! Understood? So tell the Darkness! What are you boring. Haha! I also have the power of Thor. What? Think you won? If you stop Kashchei, you will change the future! Did you think about this? And you will never see Vasilisa again! Never! You most likely won't be born at all! You won't be! Are you ready to go for it? Mikul. How... Don't let the darkness in. She will change you. And do not plot meanness against Belogor. Believe me. You are not alone. You have... You will have friends. And you will definitely find your happiness. You know what a wise man once said to me: "It's important to make the right choice at the right time." Cold. Come on, I have one more business left. Mikula! And this... Study for five. Or whatever you have. So what about darkness? As my friend Kolobok would say, let's hit you on buns! Here we are at home. Fresh fish! Let's buy... Oh you! Why don't you go home dude? You will be left without lunch. Swim, my little fish, swim! Is the bread fresh? What a fresh one, try it! Look! Talking Bread! Thank you! - Hello, Vasilisushka! - Have a nice one you too! Ah, it’s not good for a girl to lift such weights alone. Get ready, Vanyusha - it will definitely not be boring; Everything is not what it seems. Behind the wall of addresses, white foam, seas - There will be love. Your love will show up. And even if there is no strength, a friend does not call, grass does not grow - Look what the world is around - it's barely waiting; And if the dawn is far, the road does not lead, the white light is not nice - Look at the world around! Everything is here as you requested. Aw, aw, aw, aw! Aw, aw, aw, aw! Maybe sails, blue skies. The horizon will open and embrace; Or it will melt in the haze, the black forest will get lost, That makes noise only with the winds alone ... Time will bend into an arc and the light will break in the windows; And you are already on the other side, in the world which does not exist. And a secret door will open, everything will connect by itself. And maybe only here and now your love will be! Your love will be... And even if there is no strength, a friend does not call, grass does not grow - Look what the world is around - it's barely waiting; And if the dawn is far, the road does not lead, the white light is not nice - Look at the world around! Everything is here as you requested. Aw, aw, aw, aw! Aw, aw, aw, aw! How the heart beats like a surf. The moon pours in the night, prepares peace for me; I'm restless… Oh, oh, oh, oh… And even if there is no strength, a friend does not call, grass does not grow - Look what the world is around - it's barely waiting; And if the dawn is far, the road does not lead, the white light is not nice - Look at the world around! Everything is here as you requested. Aw, aw, aw, aw! Aw, aw, aw, aw!
