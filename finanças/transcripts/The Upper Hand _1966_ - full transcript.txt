RIFIFI IN PARIS Go through the customs. I'll follow. Nothing to declare? Paul Berger's papers are always in order. You had a good stay in London, Mr Berger? Perfect, inspector. - Who's that guy? - Paulo les Diams (Paulo Diamonds). - Don't know him. - I do. - All right, big guy? - Good trip, Mr Paul? Yeah, except for the rain. We first go home and then to the "Voluptuous". So... big guy.. what are you telling? Come inside, it's warm, sir! Girls galore in cinemascope Japanese aphrodisiacs. 32 photos for your winter evenings... Makes you wonder what that's coming to France for. - Good evening, sir. - Good evening. Weather's terrible! - Lili's here? - She was worried not seeing you. I'll send her at once. Cloakroom! Your hand in my crotch when you pay for a cinzano. You're kidding! - We can go there, can't we? - That way? It's champagne way. - You got the means? - Well... I... - Your yank's here! - Again! Don't make him wait. Prepare him to meet René tonight. Prepare him! I'm not a pressure cooker! Good evening. You're out of your mind! Bring us a bottle of Dom Perignon. Tourist's cheap wine's not for me. At the moment, dollars are not worth so much, you know. Dollars! You find them if you're clever enough. Don't be angry! You'll come with me tonight? - What about my bracelet? - I already gave you a necklace 3 days ago. - How am I supposed to do? - Ask your boss! I've already asked twice this month. "Chicago Tribune" is not the Salvation Army. I'm not in charity work either. Don't exagerate. I give you everything I have. Yes, but you've got nothing. Not to do better than that with your job, you must be good for nothing. Journalists travel, don't they? - Yes. - And you don't use the opportunity? Opportunity? What do you mean? You can make 5 million if you're not dumb. Five, what do you say to that? - In two trips. - Five million? How can I do that? If you're interested, I can tell René. The barman? I maybe good for nothing but I'm straight. Well... then get married and make love to your little wife. After the news bulletin. That way you'll know about the world. Call him! I knew you were sentimental! The gentleman would like to earn some pocket money. What you told me about... it's still o.k.? Still. But I need to talk to Mr Thomson. Can you leave us for a while? I hope you've never been convicted. - Would you mind? - No, but our conversation would be over. What is there to do? A trip with a small amount of gold. Oh, no. It's too risky. If you're not known to the police, there's no risk at all. Where's that trip to? If you're interested, I'll introduce you to the person who's in charge. Let's see. I'll make a phone call. If he's here, you'll see him tonight. - Please, barman. - Yes, sir. - You forgot something on the bill. - Really? What, sir? To stick it up your ass. Now, sir... please! If you ask me so politely, I'll do it! Who are the assholes at the bar? Don't know them. They've never been here before! What's going on, Charlie? This gentleman says I can stick the bill up my hole. - You're not polite, young man. - Who asked you to come, grandfather? For the bill, you'll tell your boss we'll come by to see him. - We must talk to him. - I'm the boss. So... I'm listening. So you won't have to come back. You're Paulo les Diams? For wretches like you, I'm called Paul Berger. Please... O.K.... How much is it? As for racket, I only give to the employees of Mr Giscard d'Estaing. Now, get the hell out of here. If someone asks for me I'm at the "Voluptuous". Good evening, Mr Paul. The yankee's here. - You know everything about him? - Perfect. He really works for "The Chicago Tribune". Never been convicted... - He's broke? - Lili took it all. He will do anything. - He's in love? - Yes. Well... tell him to come. Thank you. - Good evening, Mr Paul. - Good evening to you. You're the best of all dogs. You've got financial trouble? - Yes, I need money. - Alas! Don't we all? - You want to earn 5 million? - What must I do? - A trip. - Where? - Tokyo. You're taking some gold along. - What about the customs? Well, we've thought about it. Not for your benefit. For the gold. - Are you in it or not? - When will I get the 5 million? When you've finished your work. But as you look fastidious. I must tell you there's no social security. Right, come back tomorrow, same time and apply for your visa quickly. - Suzy, have you got the blue? - Wait a sec. - You're tickling... - Don't move. Hey... it's the U.S. embassy! Why is the hell he coming here? - You've never applied for a passport? - You must have travelled a lot... during the 5 years you were inside at Fresnes. Let me introduce Mike Coppolano. The best U.S. treasury agent. Commissioner Noel, French Police. Is that our man? Yes... Born in Saint Ouen. Saint-Ouen, that's Paris? - Yes - And Fontevrault? Something like Sing-Sing. - We must have common friends. - We should ask him. He's been specialized in gold long? Not that we know. - You have details about this traffic? - Not many... I'm flying to Tokyo in 2 days' time with 30 kilos of gold. 180 thou a kilo in Paris, 850 in Tokyo... About 10 million profit for each trip. Minus the 5 he gives for carrying it. - You haven't got them yet. - I'd like to see that. You'll see. Be careful, Mr Coppolano. If he discovers who you are... I won't be able to help. Here are two family portraits I advise you to look closely at. It might help you. They're Paulo's body guards. Two guys who like a good laugh. Taxi, Mr Thomson? So... everything was all right? You've got the statuettes? Give! How can I be sure I'm to give them to you? Don't worry! The boss told me to give your dough... There's only 500 thousand! So what? It's not enough? Put them in a saving accounts. It will bring interests. Drive me to Mr Paulo's. He promised me 5 million. I must have them. You must... You must... I don't mind driving you there. But I've known Paulo for some time and he doesn't like being messed around with. If I were you, I'd pipe down. I can speak? I got two phone calls from a man with an Italian accent. He said to let you down for Tokyo. That it was that or... There was no way I'd obey of course. Yes. Tomorrow. Hello, Paulo. - Hello Irene. Walter's in? - He's waiting for you. How are you? I'm bringing your chinese curio. I think you'll be happy. I haven't seen any like them for at least three years. Unfortunately this one is flawed. Look at the hand... I can't see a thing. The customers won't see anything either. - Nobody never sees anything. - So... what the hell do you care? It's like a beautiful woman who'd be cross-eyed. It would be sad,wouldn't it? - What's new? - Jack's just been knocked off in London. I got that. Give up Tokyo while you can. Shit! You too... I'll ask you to phone Munich. I'd like to have news of Willy. I'll take care of it. If some people are interested in Tokyo. Let them take our place. Are you nuts? We're not going to give up such a business. You had a great idea, Walter. Only fools fight to keep their great ideas for themselves. I have lots of ideas. Tokyo? It's over... I've thought of something else. Maybe but not as profitable. More profitable than Tokyo and less risky. - Have you ever been on a pilgrimage? - What? Not the sort of thing you do. I know. But there are pilgrims... in all the airports in the world, leaving for Lourdes, Fatima or Mecca. Do you know how many of those people get across borders? - I have no idea. - You're wrong. Someone like you... and me should read statistics. We who exploit human stupidity. It's the only unlimited ressource. Pilgrims... Diamonds in prayer beads. I would not have thought of it. All we need is a shop near Saint Sulpice church. We organize the trip by ourselves. The pilgrims' club! It looks better than luring our carriers with a piece of ass. And those will cost us nothing. They won't talk. I'll explain all that in details. It's easy to organize and there's much less risk than with Tokyo. I agree. It's a very good idea. But we'll give up Tokyo when we want to, not before. I'm going to start lowering my pants now, at sixty! Paul's right. It's a matter of dignity. We must fight. Fight! If playing western gives you a thrill, let's fight. But against whom? Don't worry! We'll know soon enough. Did you get through with Munich? No. Willy doesn't answer. He doesn't answer. What's wong with him? What's going on? Nothing! Come quick! Why are you driving so fast? We were to go dancing. You will dance in Vienna. How many are they? He's on his own. I've waited all night for her. I've paid three bottles of champagne... it gives me the right to take her with me. I didn't want to drink your bottles, you bastards! A nice place, Paris... I can tell... Help him find the way to the door. - This fellow's getting up my nose. - Closing time, sir. This way... You're asked on the phone, Mr Paul. This person already called a while ago. He won't say his name. Don't move, son. I'll be back. - Hello, I'm listening. - Paulo les Diams? - Who's asking? - A small piece of advice, Paulo. - Give up on Walter. - I like to know who I'm talking to. You'll know if you accept. We're working with you now. Same percentage. - All right? - Walter's my friend. It explains all. You're wrong, Paulo. In London and Munich they tried to play it tough. Now you decide. I want an answer now. You say yes or no? It's "shit"! Go get my rod in the car. And what is it that you want? You promised me 5 millions. I only got 500 thousand francs. - So what? - I'm waiting for the rest. You don't wish to intimidate me, do you? I don't think you'd like the police to come and nose around. That'll teach you that police is a forbidden word here. Got it? Come on, get up! Watch out! Rif, come here! Get him inside, quick! He got it in the thigh. Go, both of you. You'll clean up tomorrow. - And you saw nothing, right? - You don't say, Mr Paul. Hey... it's the nasty one I whopped the other night! Didn't I tell you I didn't want to see you anymore? Who are you working for, you little piece of shit? Who? Fuck you! To make things worse, you're impolite. Take care of him... Hold his arms or he's going to dance the twist. We don't need that. You may not be naturally eloquent but you're going to speak. Tell us who sent you. It will be much better. Mario par Giulio, my pal! Mario Carpagna, the Milanese. He's in Paris? - Yeah! - Where? I don't know. Giulio didn't say. Your Giulio... he must be somewhere. Brentania bar, rue Soffroid. Every night he plays poker. Drive him to Bichat Hospital. Leave him at the door. You ring and the nurses will come. Shouldn't we finish off? We'll be nice to him. In any case, when he comes out... his friends will have a little chat with him. Well... you're not resentful, are you? - Will you have scotch? - Gladly. - You react quickly! - I've been touring Korea. Well...I owe you one. You owe me 5 million above all. That remains to be seen. We can talk about that, maybe. I see... If you can still shoot a gun I can offer you better than the 5 million. At this time, I feel lonely. You might keep me company. The pay is better than in journalism and to tell the truth... it's more serious. - They tried with you too? - Yes, but I couldn't do that to you. - Thank you, Paulo. - Don't be stupid. It's a normal thing. Why are you bringing these gentlemen? To spare the cost of a funeral wreath. I'll leave you one while I take care of Mario. Maybe afterwards you won't need my gentlemen. - And you know where Mario is? - Tonight I will. So I stay here and keep watch on the guy and the sister. You could forget Saint Ouen lingo when you talk about my friends. You can never leave Saint Ouen completely behind you know. Even when you have a tailor in London. You think so? O.k. Thanks, Pfeiffer. See you soon. He's called Walter, stateless person, born in Germany, no problems... with French justice. Trades in antiques. Has married Paulo les Diams's ex-mistress. A stripper, German too. Also owns an import-export business on the boulevard Malesherbes. Many customers from North America and Eastern countries. - Well... Strange! - Why? We knew U.S. military equipment went from the East to Cuba. It transits through Tokyo and maybe through Boulevard Malesherbes. If I follow you, trafficking gold and military equipment is linked. Yes... and I can tell you now: that's why Mike Cappolano is here. Now that I had understood, thanks for telling me. Paulo really has ambition, hasn't he? Excuse me! I'm going to play a chorus on my typewriter for him. Excuse me, Madam, please... I was going to the chemist's. Don't take me too far away. My husband might worry. Don't try to be funny. We didn't come here for laughs. Put that gun away. You might get hurt. And I hope your mother allows you to stay out out late else... I'm getting down. Shut up! You're being rude! Listen... We're not amused by your jokes. We can make you swallow them quickly. We take you to the country. We'll rape you and put a bullet in your head. Group sex is not my style, you know. That broad is annoying. Slap her. You'd better start with hand kisses if you want to seduce me. Hey you... Duchess of my ass, if you want to keep your man... you must use your influence so that he understands where his interest is. My husband makes business as he sees fit. I have no influence over him. Oh! With that ass of yours, there are ways to convince a man. Pity you haven't got one like that. You wouldn't have to play with your gun. Hey... listen... Respect! That's enough! Here's what you'll tell your fat man: With Paulo, they failed. So they're trying with you. I'm fed up with all those cowboys. They'll all end up in jail. They're too stupid. That's why they're dangerous and excited. Trigger under pressure. In fact I was not really bragging. They think I'll give up on Paulo. Who do they take me for? They're delusional. They probably think, I'll push you to betraying him. They're keen psychogists. If they want to off him first, we should forewarn him. To get Paulo with his gorilla troop it would take a genius... with a squadron of machine-guns. But even that way it might fail. Nevertheless I'm somewhat worried. I would have guessed as much. Why are you telling this? I'm joking. I'm always joking. Paul's my friend so you're worried about him. It's natural, right? You're a good wife and that's it. We must reach him. Roger will know where he is. Where's Paulo? He does not seem easy to find. He is going out tonight. He hasn't told you? Turn around and wait for us here. - Good evening everyone. - Good evening, gentlemen. - Don't move! - How's your father? My father? I haven't seen him for 10 years. Well, say good-bye to your friends, you have a family matter to settle. The family lawyer's expecting us. So come quick if you don't want me to make you happy here. All right, I'm coming. We need the young man here too. Come on! You've got to come too. - Another car is tailing them? - No, the old one would see it at once. Well, after all, if things go wrong, we'll have two thugs less on the spot. I will have seen nothing. That's the important thing. You pass for a wop so that you can doublecross your father's friends better? Giulio... I'll give you Giulios... I've done five years inside to cover up for your father... and if he could see you he would not be proud of you, you goon. And you, the artist? You know where Mario lives? - Which Mario? - Throw that out. Hey...if he is not dead he can spill out. Spill to the cops? About what? About wanting to off me? Turn right. - So... where is Mario? - I don't know. You're positive? Right... He's yours, Jo. Hold the rope. So wop... you like beautiful ties? Wagram 6314. You'll remember what you have to say? And don't try any trick. Dial the number, Jo. Hello, the "Monceau"? Mr Carpania, please. Hello, Mario? Sorry to disturb you but it's important. You should come down with some cash. We can get Paulo les Diams. Yes, I've got one of his men. For 3 mil he'll take him to us. Well... I'll wait for you near the hotel. On the terrace opposite the phone booth - What is he saying? - He's telling him not to come. Carpania! You do it, Mike! No, let me live, please. I can tell you how to get Mario. He'll make his prayers later. Nothing can help him. Shoot! Get dressed! What's going on? I was supposed to stay the night. I've lost my Olympic condition. What about my 30 thou? Take this. And now forget about me. At this rate, you can always call me. Regent 54442. And before try Milan. Listen... My room number must not be given to anyone. And nobody should be allowed to come up without my allowing it. I trust you for that, o.k.? Thank you. The fractured skull in Pantin? It's you too? Soon you'll tell me that you're the one who cut up the woman in St Lazare. Seeing how it goes on, there's no reason for it to stop. - I didn't do it for fun. - That would be the end! I don't know if you realize what situation I'm in because of you. We're not in Congo here! - I should arrest you. - But you won't do it. I might get fired. Of course you don't care about that. A lot is at stake here. The U. S. embassy would speak for you... if you got into trouble because of us. What a work! I had better be a shopkeeper like my parents. Well... well! The antique dealer? He's into it? I'm almost sure that for the Tokyo thing, he is the boss. - And for Cuba? - I wouldn't be surprised. I received this this morning. Advise your friend to give up on Tokyo if he does not want us... to tell the Americans about his trade deal with Cuba. You've got nothing to do with Cuba, have you? I have. I sell them spare-parts for GMC, tires, a few axles, fuel engines for tanks... other spare-parts. Small things. Shit! You call that small things. It's military equipement. You make a lot of cash with those? It's not as profitable as you'd think. There are lots of expenses. We transit through 4 or 5 countries. And the Cubans are poor. Are you telling me you're doing charity work for those guys? It's difficult to explain, Paulo. It's quite personal Personal! Personal! You're funny! Don't you think you owe me some explanations? Yes, Paul. But I fear you won't be able to understand. So I'm stupid! I'm one of the few people who can provide the Cuban revolution... with the equipment they need. So you take those risks only for the love of politics! You won't run for elections in Cuba, will you? Ah... it's not so simple, Paulo... You've never been kicked out of your country. You don't know what being a political refugee is like. Cuba today is my youth. And as I've been lucky I pay my share to help a right cause. Right! Right! If you're shot down your right will look nice... And the bearded one does not give a damn if you get killed. What got inside your head? You're nuts! A guy as clever as you are talking bullshit that way. You make me think of my father when he came home drunk on Saturdays... he only spoke of Jean Jaurès. I knew who wouldn't understand. That's why I didn't tell you about it. You want me to tell you? You're in a real mess. Lucky for you you're my pal... because I really don't like your last find. Of course. But I prefer you to know. I didn't like hiding this from you. But there's something I find hard to understand: Who could have written this? Mario couldn't know about Cuba. I'll try and straighten this out. And in spite of all the crap you're into. I'll leave my two choir boys here. They'll go to Malesherbes with you. I'm ready, gentlemen. Wait a sec, please. I'll look round. If Mr Ravzik calls from Prague, tell him the goods are on the way. He'll be able to take delivery day after tomorrow in Hamburg. The way is clear. Excuse me, sir... Where can I find a taxi? - Where's the nearest hospital? - No hospital. My place. Avenue Kléber, quick. If I can't reach home alive, tell Irene everything's in the blue book... in the right drawer of my desk. Write...quick. I haven't got much time. Be quiet. The doctor is coming... In vain. Write! Mr Gulette Muleron-sur-Orne. The small statues... You know? I know. Don't worry. Legall's paintings are at Bronsky's. He owes me 10 million. You don't know everything. Bronsky owns 12% on the Syria thing. Tell Paulo. He must watch out. Bronsky is a scoundrel. What time is it? 6:25. At 7, you'll be free... maybe earlier. Do you still love Paulo? Don't talk about that! I want to tell you once again. I love you. I want you to be happy. I know. But you 're not going to die. I will. Paulo had told to give up the Cuba thing. But what can i do? I'm here, darling. There's nothing you can do. I would have liked to end... showing you another face. Your face is beautiful. A man has to be able to cry. No, you're not going to die. The doctor will come, and tomorrow... you'll ask me for coffee... as you always do. Here are the freight notes for Hamburg yesterday. You've put your finger on the network. It's a big piece. Maybe, but it's time for me to send these people breathe the air in Fresnes. No, please. Don't step in yet. I need other leads. I need names... all the names. Nobody should escape. Leave them free, all of them. Until the investigation is over. The way it goes, the commitment requirements will be short. They'll all be found in the "Père Lachaise" cemetery, your thugs. And I, in Saint Flour, express transfer. Well... for the antique dealer, I'll accept what the widow is saying. My husband had no enemy. It's a tragical mistake. Everyone will think of me as a dead loss. Tell me, Mr Coppolano if you like so much playing gangsters... you should change suits. In our country with such trousers... one goes pick strawberries. Well... Here you come dressed like a real redskin. - I'd like to see Lili. - Busy in box 3...Your box. - Evening, Mike. - Good evening. From Mr Paulo. Congratulations! You seem to be doing much better. Call Lili. Lili! Come here a sec please. I can't believe it! You had your all front remade. You've really changed! Is he the man you're supposed to introduce to us? Why? You're the one who... Things change! What's it like? He's crazy about me. He's completely broke. - Really penniless. - I'd be surprised otherwise. You know you're handsome? I like you a lot. We could share a pillow. What do you think of it? - Still in love? - More and more. But I've got work tonight. I've got to take care of your Romeo. He gave you that ring? You'll be able to open a shop soon. So...you want to earn five million? Someone is asking for you, Mr Paul. A Mr Tony Balesta. He says he is a friend of yours. Tony Balesta? What the hell is he coming to Paris for? Make him come in but tell Roger to keep a discrete watch. Mr Paul asks you to keep an eye on the gentleman who's waiting. - With tact. - All right. It's a surprise, Tony. Sit down. - So how are you doing? - Fine. What about you? I would be better if someone wasn't trying to wreck my business. - You must have heard of it, right? - Yes, that's why I'm here. Really? Mario Carpania sent for you? He didn't send for me, Paul. He called me. Ah! So the Syndicate is interested in our business. Yes. I've come from the U.S. with Binaggio to make a deal with you. I can't tell you anything tonight. You're invited to a meeting tomorrow. And I'm sure we'll find an agreement. - That's another story. - It would be better. Mario will be there? Yes and the new bosses for Germany and England. Well... you're not wasting time. Tell Binaggio I'll be there. And where do you hold your Yalta conference? At the Monceau Palace. As you won't let Mario come out. See you tomorrow. 3 p.m. Sorry, Tony. No offense meant. But I can't shake the hand of a guy who... comes to France to hurt me. If I were in your place, I'd do the same, Paulo. Good night. Tony Ballesta is one of the big shots of the Syndicate. I almost pinned him 5 years ago for drug dealing. If I face him... That will add a new corpse to the collection. Which one? New-York Contact. A fishing party! - I'd like to see them. - We need the blue book. The address must be in it. That's easy on paper! Don't rank, Mike. We already have great results. We already have the names of 22 couriers to Japan. For Cuba, everything must be in this book. All you have to do is seduce the widow. That wouldn't be unpleasant. To the Monceau Palace. It's Mario's day? Not yet! - Mr Binaggio and Mr Balesta, please? - Apartment 401. Thanks. - You are Paulo les Diam? - I am Mr Paul Berger, yes. You're expected. The gentlemen are over there. I'm sorry, Mr Berger. A small formality. Please do. Case! Only papers. It's o.k., Mr Paul. They're not carrying. Roger and Mike! Frisk all those gentlemen. Mr Balesta, too. - Where are you going, Tony? - In my room. Hey, Mike... Hurry up! O.k., o.k., I'm coming... Reminds me of the body search in Poissy penitenciary. Keep your memories to yourself. What about a little drink? Well, your fellow countrymen are real hard drinkers. Even better than the wops. If there's a beef I leave the yanks to you, I take care of the others. To each his race. And open up your ears. I don't get zip of what they're saying. It'd be better if we were first to draw. Where are we going? - You're sure nobody followed you? - Yes. - Really sure? - I told you. - I'm no altar boy. - It's important this time. - You swear you won't tell? - If you will. Where are you taking me? In a small restaurant where the beaujolais comes from Beaujolais... and the snails don't come from Poland. The sort of address you don't even give your best friend. So why me? - Dead men don't advertise. - You don't value my skin much, do you? I'm not paying for your skin. But seeing how little it's valued... by your bosses, it must not cost them much. I calculated that, on hoof, I was valued the same as that of T Bone. $1500 a month. 750 thousand francs! At that rate we must be off als here. Tell me princess, you've got a dreamy look. What are you thinking of? Of the future. A small cottage and a safe. Don't say that. There's more to life than loot. May I? Hearing you say that took my breath away. Of course, you have no ideals. You're wrong! What do you think? That I blow my mind drinking your plonk... with stutterers who can't even paw my ass without laddering my stockings. But you must know how to sacrifice in this life. - Your old mother maybe! - No, mister. My dignity. I'm sickened by those society girls who wait in rows for a guy... they don't even know to beckon them. Marriage is not a whorehouse. To go up you don't need the mayor. When I'll say yes, it will mean something. Because I have the means to say no. You won't even have room for a wedding-ring. I will. It's the only ring I'll wear. On what hand do they wear it in America? My sister's hand. If you feel for that yankee, it will be a mess. Why do you get angry? Didn't you see I was nuts about Mike? As long as he was a journalist, I couldn't think of the future. You can't keep a woman on that sort of wages. But now that he works for Mr Paul, now that he has serious work. I think we can go to Barbès and choose bedroom furniture. He's been brave till the end... You know... One feels really lonely in those moments. Poor girl! You finally loved him, didn't you? Yes. He was very dear to me. And since he died, I've been feeling down. You can't imagine... I'm really unlucky. I had got used to him. I had started forgetting you. Forgetting you was not easy though. Look, Irene. Now is really not the right moment to talk about this. He has always known. That's why he was sad sometimes. That you could leave that way without any reason, I couldn't get used to that. Yet I should have. He was nicer than you are. Richer. And funnier. It's important too. And so considerate. You can't imagine it. Well... he was in love with me. And I'm in love with you. But you're in love with no one. That's life! Irene, I've always been straight with you. Look at me... With my 60 years of age and my white hair do you think I can play this game? I'm too old for a beautiful girl like you. That's for me to decide. And I'm not into those things any more. Sit down and let's talk business. - Tomorrow I'll ask guaranties for you. - No, Paulo, let go. With what Walter left me, I have no money problem. Cut a deal with them. I don't understand any more. A few days ago you wanted to fight. But I thought you were against Mario only. The Syndicate: that's different. They're too big. They'll get you as they got all the others before. With me, I can tell you they'll get into a real clash. Your bravery is not enough. I'm afraid for you. Can't I be afraid for you? You don't have to be afraid. I want to deal under my own conditions. - It's a matter of principles. - You've got too many principles. - These days, principles are useless. - Binaggio already told me so. Maybe am I from another time but it's mine. This being said, if you need a friend, if you want to talk, you can count on me. Because what's left between us is the best: tenderness. - I know. - Good evening, my sweet. Good evening, fool. You stay here. Don't fall asleep at the same time, o.k.? - Good evening Mr Paul. - Good evening. I'm not sleepy yet. I'll take first watch. What's going on? I heard someone whistling this side. I don't like signals. - You saw nothing? - No. Anyway, you're watching, guys. Good night. I'll relieve you. Go to sleep, yank. I don't think the Indians will attack. Shit! I left my gun upstairs. That's worth court-martial, pal! Tell me, friend, do you know where he hid his whisky? No I don't. That kraut didn't look like a coca-cola addict. We're asking idle questions. Of course, it's better if the arrests are made at the same time... in Paris and in New-York. We won't wait long. The meeting will take place at 3. - Are you ready? - We've been ready since morning. Shit! That scum killed him. Quick! Take him. Drive quietly now. - Still going to the Monceau? - No. Rue Danrémont. I've got a bullet in the arm. But I don't think it's serious. - To the doctor's? - Yes. What scum! The guy who shot was at the Monceau yesterday, wasn't he? Yes. Roger, you'll ring the Monceau and ask for Balesta. You'll tell him we'll be one and a half hour late. But that I agree with everything. Got it? Got it. And you'll take the car to the garage. You'll come and get me with a taxi. Stay on line. I'll connect you to Mr Balesta. Hello, Guillaume speaking. The meeting is delayed by 1 and a half hour. You're sure you're not doing wrong? Wrong or not... That Binaggio scum doublecrossed me. He'll pay for it. I've been doublecrossed from the start. Jack, Willy, Walter, Jo. Now my dog! That's a big price! - They've killed your dog? - Yes. When I was leaving for the conference. They'll get their conference. I understand, Paulo. But think it over. I think you're trying to reach too far. I've finished thinking! - They're here. - Make them come in. - You've got the stuff? - Here you are, Mr Paul. It's been timed at 5. Believe me, at 5, you'd better be far away. Help me. Don't worry. It is silent. Believe me, it's spot on. Good... Take this. - It's more than we agreed. - Doesn't matter. Today I'm generous. When I go out, if they try to stop me, you shoot undiscriminately. It will be 2 minutes to 5 Don't try to understand. 2 minutes to 5. How shall we scram after? Broken Nose will wait for us with a D. S. Let's adjust time. It is 32 minutes past 4. All right? Let's go. You're expected. Take my hat. - Give me 30 thou. - 30 thou? I'll give them back to you. Buy a wreath for your pal, Sergio. Kind of you. May I? - All right. And in the case? - Papers for your boss. - You want us to frisk them? - It won't be necessary. Yes. You're sure the book was not on the same side? The yankee was in the room when you went in. You're sure? Thanks, Irene. I'll get back to you. ...No, no everything's all right. Hey Tony! Where are you going? Going for a piss. If you've got prostate trouble, we've got good specialists in France. They should have sent me to Berlitz... What's wrong? You look strange. I'm all right. Only it's too hot here. - Have a drink. - Yes. It's time to start watching out. Don't move. They're coming. - Shall we need ambulances? - No, tea spoons. Congrats! You're a criminal, Paulo. But you're courageous. I'll keep good memories of you.
