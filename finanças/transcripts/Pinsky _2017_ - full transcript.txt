(glass breaking) (uplifting electronic music) - [Sophia Voiceover] This is me, Sophia. Welcome to my shtetl, my village, Boston. I work here at Lubinsky's Market, selling goods to the locals. These village people belong to an ancient population called Russian Jews. I started working here in college, and I haven't left. - Hi. (speaks foreign language) - 14.98. Where'd you learn Russian? - An ex, I only know a few words. Thanks. I don't need a bag. - [Sophia] Oh. - What's going on with that guy? - [Sophia] He's Russian. - So? - So he's gonna stare at our only black customer. - That's a good thing, I thought he was giving me the sex eyes. I was gonna tell you let him down easy for me. By the way, that redhead pocketed a few oranges. - Bye. - [Sophia Voiceover] And why the shitty techno music? Russians like it, so we play it all the time. Welcome to my life. - Dina! Remind me why I'm still working at the bazaar. - [Sophia Voiceover] I live with my girlfriend, Dina. - I'm this close to quitting. Hello! Dina? - [Sophia Voiceover] Correction, lived. (sobs) I don't know, maybe I was possessive and crazy, or maybe I was just more in love with her than she was with me. (phone rings) - Hello. - Are you crying? - Vicky, do you think I'm self-victimizing? - Maybe. No, absolutely not. What do you mean exactly? - Dina broke up with me. - [Sophia Voiceover] This is my brother Vicky, he loves me. But he loves everyone. - Dedushka's dead. - What? - He collapsed on the street. - Okay. - Okay. - Dina broke up with me, so that won't be a problem. Do I hear you smiling? - [Sophia Voiceover] The day Dina and I started dating is the day my grandmother stopped speaking to me. We haven't talked in three years. - Yep, yep. Come on, a little more. Okay. - [Sophia Voiceover] That's Kiki, part of the Selibovsky family, close family friends. Too close. (whimsical music) - Go Sox! - [Sophia Voiceover] I grew up in Boston, but I wouldn't say I'm from here. I would say that I'm from this house, 112 Murdoch Street. Welcome to the Russian Embassy of Massachusetts. Here's the shiva, the funeral after party that lasts seven long days and nights. (family chats) - My little girl. - [Sophia Voiceover] And this is my papochka. The only thing he loves more than his mamochka is his ballroom dancing partner, Ilanachka. Look who is here. - [Sophia Voiceover] Meet the Selibovskys. Natasha was cheated on by her husband with my grandmother's slutty dental hygienist, and now we're fused at the hip forever. And that's Trevor, Natasha's son and Kiki's brother. He's not so bad. - So do you still do the... - Nothing, yeah. - No, I... - What do you do with your life? - Well, I'm working in a lab, doing research on the impaired venous drainage of the foot. It's varicose veins. I hear you're still dating that girl from college, Dina. - We just broke up. - I'm sorry. - No, it's fine, actually, all I had to do was read a letter. (classical piano music) - I love you so much, Sophiachka. - Calm down. - Trevor, how's the new apartment? - It's beautiful. I like the new facial hair. - Just trimmed it, actually. - Yeah, it looks good, man. - Not really. Can you talk to Babushka, please? - Your breath is hideous. - [Sophia Voiceover] This is the Rabbi, the good soul who picked up my family and the Selibovskys, fresh off the boat during the great Russian Jewish migration of 1982. (knocks) - Would you please just let me in? - [Natasha] Gonna be a minute. - I'm gonna shit myself! I can't believe you've survived this long with just one bathroom. - Thank god for the kitchen sink. (laughs) - Stop, it's gonna come out my mouth. (knocks) - I raised you with manners, don't embarrass me! - You look nice. - [Kiki] No I don't. You don't look good at all. - I know. - [Kiki] You never change. - I am timeless. - [Kiki] (laughs) Sure. - KK, I have news. I'm gonna be a policeman. - [Kiki] What, they're gonna give you a gun? - Of course. - [Kiki] You know what, Vicky? You have a good voice. Stick to the guitar. - No I don't. - [Kiki] Yeah you do. - I could sing to you. - [Kiki] Do it. - Really? - Really. - Gonna love you like before. - Intro to Kiki and Vicky love nest. These two love birds met when they were kids together. Everyone remembers Sasha Kalinsky's bar mitzvah, where Kiki dry humped the shit out of my brother during an Usher song, and then he splooged all over himself. We don't mention that. - Though they take me for a toad. And snap on my synapses, electrode. Until the amygdala corrodes. And I twitch and croak as my head explodes. (chuckles) (toilet flushes) - [Sophia Voiceover] So this used to be my room, but my babushka sort of colonized it for herself. Where's my grandfather's watch? When I was a kid, instead of reading me bedtime stories, my grandfather and I would act out Zolushka, the Russian Cinderella, and I'd giggle myself to sleep. Oh shit, that's probably her. Babushka loves Benjamin Netanyahu, Bach, and anything fermented. - [Sophia Voiceover] She survived Stalin, and I survived her. - [Sophia] I'm not moving back. - Get out of the closet. - Can I have the watch? - No. - Papa's just gonna sell it. - [Sophia Voiceover] He wore it my entire childhood. - Well I'm almost 30 years old, and you're just gonna throw away everything anyway. - Yeah? - Yeah. - [Sophia] That's fine. - [Sophia Voiceover] You know, you can be from a place, but it's a lot harder to find a home. Home is where my fridge is, full of salmon, almond milk, and light. (polka music) - If you're not a liberal by the age of 21, you have no heart. If you're a liberal after the age of 21, you have no head. (derisive laughter) - Who invited this loser? Get off the stage, get off the stage! - If you weren't such a bitch, I might think about being part of your life. (phone rings) Hi. - [Sophia] Fine. - I just saw you. - Three days ago. We are almost done with the leftovers. - [Sophia] So what? - [Victor] Meeting friends. - Babushka said you had a good talk the other day. - I have friends, they're all American, so I don't bring them here. - Not exactly. - Sophia. - I don't believe you. (polka music) - I gotta get right size. So I'm showing up here to hear from all of you people. Thank you all for being here. You set this right. Thank you. - Thank you, Mike. - So, have any folks here with a burning desire to share? Speak up. - [Sophia Voiceover] My brother's been going to these AA meetings. - Hi, I'm Victor, I'm an alcoholic. - [Group] Hi Victor. - Maybe. - [Sophia Voiceover] He thinks he's a drunk. - Sometimes I feel like I'm the type of person who isn't meant to be happy. - Thanks, Victor. - My grandfather just dropped dead. No one's talking about it. And he was the only one who kept things sane in the house. There is a difference between someone who is an alcoholic and someone who self-medicates every now and then. I'd like to know what that difference is. - Thanks, Victor. - [Sophia Voiceover] I don't really have a family right now. I don't really have friends, either. They were all pretty much Dina's. - [Sam] You know what I'm saying? - [Dominic] Yeah, I know how it is. - [Sam] We got this shit, boo. - Yeah, yeah we do. I feel like I'm Pikachu, and Liberace is like my evolved form. - I guess, what happens when you evolve, you gain more chest hair and rhinestones? - Yeah. (upbeat electronic music) Whatever, I think the pole will end it. - All I'm saying is, pick one metaphor and stick with it. - They all connect. - Dominic, I know you're a boss, you know you're a boss. - Yeah. - You want a receipt? - No thanks. - I think I'm gonna do a new one tonight. Hey, can I actually have an extra spoon for the caviar? - No, I'm not sharing. I'm working on new material tonight, too. - Cyanobacteria. You thrive in hot water like cyanobacteria. Blue-green algae, the bluest eye, the eye of the hot springs snake, growling. Dip me, dip we, evermore. Blessed is he who comes in the mouth of the lord, spermatic exultation, Old Faithful's girlish exhalation, yelling Old Yeller, howl at the moon as I implore your rump with my pump. The frenulum of the national park system opens itself to you, citizens of America. Consider purchasing a national park pass for only $80. Imagine what awaits. - Wow. That was really emotional. - Would you say it landed? - Yeah, yeah, I'd say that landed, for sure. I really liked how you rhymed rump with pump. - Thanks. - I gotta go set up. - Oh, we have a weekly open mic at Jacque's, if you wanna see more of my poetry. - [Sophia] Yeah? - Has anybody ever told you you look like Gloria Estefan? - [Sophia] No. - He thinks everyone he likes looks like Gloria Estefan, including himself, let's go. - She does, see you. - Bye. - [Sophia Voiceover] No, I'm gonna go to this, I need to go to the show. I really need to go. I need to move home and make some shekels. Oh my god, if I died tomorrow, I'd have like five people at my funeral. I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go to the show. I need friends. I need to move home, I need to make some shekels. Shit, if I had a funeral tomorrow, nobody would show up. I need to do this, I need to just go, shut up, Sophia. Shut up, I need friends. You just need friends, just walk in. Shut up, just walk in. Follow the... Dina, fuck you, motherfucker. Sophia, stop wasting your fucking life like you did for the last three goddamn years. Just walk in, stop wasting your fucking life like you did for the last three goddamn years. Dina, fuck you, Dina! Fuck you, Dina, fuck you. Fuck you, you don't get to break up with me, you fucking cunt, just walk in, Sophia. I'm not depressed. Fuck you, Dina, walk in, Sophia. Fuck you, Dina, I'm not depressed. - No white people could ask me for miles, I'd go all the way from JFK to LA in peace. (audience laughs) You gotta embrace your stereotypes, right? We think Asians are magical, we think one touch will knock you out. No one's running up on Asians, we leave them alone for the most part. White women have the power of tears, right? You guys cry and get whatever you want, beautiful. Beautiful. Every time I tell that joke, there's a white woman in the audience like mm-mm, there's a white guy next to her like yeah, yeah. They cry. It's fine, embrace your thing. I wish people cared when I cried. I'd do it more often, but they don't. No one cares when women of color, I don't even care when a woman of color cries. I see a woman of color cry, I'm like, times are hard, what do you want from me? (audience laughs) Whole world. I see a white woman cry, I'm like, oh my god, we gotta do something, look at her! She's distressed, she doesn't deserve this. - [Sophia Voiceover] I hate myself. I should've stayed home. (crowd cheers) - Yeah. Now let's get this mic started off right by welcoming everyone's favorite Italian sissy from the south shore, Dominic Galliano! Bring that ass up here, Galliano! - [Sophia Voiceover] Who am I? The biggest achievement I ever made was eating a whole pizza when I wasn't high. - Hey everybody, how's it going? I'm Dominic Galliano, and I'm gonna play a little song for you while I do a poem. (plays classical tune) And the poem is called Nature's Calamari. - [Sophia Voiceover] I have my father's hairy arms. Sexy. - [Dominic] Like seashells scattered along the shore. The ocean's spray froths to a head to feed my bitter gloom, weeping. - Oh, excuse me. - [Dominic] Speak to me, Poseidon... - You're really funny. - Thanks. - What's your name, again? - [Sophia Voiceover] Sam. - I'm Sophia. - Thought you had to work. - I've never been to one of these before. - An open mic? Happens every Tuesday. - So you just sign up, and if you have something, then you just show up? - Yeah, why, what do you wanna do, standup? - Maybe, I don't know. - There's been a flood of you guys lately. - Well, I guess I'm always a step behind the trend. - Apparently. - [Sophia Voiceover] Should I be embarrassed? Just like middle school. My boobs are even about the same size. Fucker. - (yelps) That hurts. - [Sophia Voiceover] I've decided to move home and look for unconditional love. - It's beautiful. - [Sophia Voiceover] Where I'm most likely to find it. (phone rings) Here's to regressing. - Hello? Hi, Ilana. - You need to have your eyebrows done. - [Sophia Voiceover] I remember when they put me into that ugly debuncus and this Russian poofy jacket thing, and I walk into school and there was Casey Rothcop wearing her red North Face and Uggs, and was like, "You look fresh off the boat." At least I'm not alone with my thoughts anymore. - That's enough, Mama, give me a break! - Ilana, goodbye. - Mama! And I am a grown man, with my pants down, letting my mom yell at me. - [Natasha] Oi, Marina. - Oi, Marina. - What, Marina? - You actually have a nice voice. - [Natasha] What are you going to make for dinner? - I don't know. (strums guitar) - Victor. When are you going to ask my Kiki out? - Maybe cutlets. - Never. - Never. You've been flirting with her since the third grade. - Not at all, no I haven't. (knocking) - Hi. - We saw you next to each other at the shiva and thought it's time. - Exactly. (sneezes) It's time. - It's time for the wedding. - Imagine, why wouldn't I? - [Sophia Voiceover] Why me? - This is, I'm sorry. (upbeat music) - [Sophia] No. (singing in foreign language) - Oh my god. - You have to get that. - Yeah I do. And you have to get that. - Amazing. - Thank you. - [Trevor] Thanks so much. - Oh, you're welcome. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Have a good one. We should have bought more stuff at the toy store. - I guess so. - Do you wanna swing? - Sure. - Can't believe I'm on a date with Fran Drescher's double, this is like a dream come true for me. - I can't believe this. Two weeks ago, I had my own apartment and I was in a relationship with somebody who knew me. - Don't do that. - And now I'm on a date with a dude. - A dude? - Your hair is so square. - Look Sophia, I didn't wanna do this either, I still have a girlfriend. - You have a girlfriend? - Yeah, my mother's insane. Catherine knows that. - Catherine, you have a girlfriend named Catherine? - Yeah, my mom cries every time I mention her name. - We should pretend like we're dating and then have this explosive fight in front of them. - So we'd bicker at dinner, and then it escalates into me calling you an ugly wench, and then you start crying? - And it'll get them to shut up. - That's true. - You could've done more with your tongue. - God. You know, Catherine loves the way I kiss. - Well maybe Catherine doesn't know any better. - She's bisexual. - Everyone's bisexual. - Everyone is not bisexual. - Everyone is bisexual. They're bisexual or they're sexually repressed dudes who still get their haircuts at Supercuts. - Okay, I am not sexually repressed. - Have you ever had anyone put anything in your ass? - No, but hey, that doesn't mean I'm self-hating. - Then you simply haven't lived. - And you obviously have never had a hemorrhoid. - Alright. - Alright. - Please, can we do it? - Do what, anal sex or me pretending to break up with you? - Both, one, the other, I don't know, pick one, please! - Oh my god, you are relentless. - If you love me, you'll do it. - Fine, I'll pretend to break up with you, if you promise to return my calls from now on. - I promise to return your calls, right now, all of them. Can we get a burrito, I'm hungry. - No, because I am already exhausted by you. - Okay. Bye. - [Sophia Voiceover] Mm, chicken burrito with guac and sour cream and cheese. (sighs) - [Radio Announcer] (speaks foreign language) - [Sophia Voiceover] This is Babushka's secret dungeon lair, where she plots to take over the world. She comes here to get away, because she hates planes and can't drive. She washes everything twice because my father doesn't like to wipe. - Hi, it's me. I need to see you. I want... Let's have Shabbat dinner this Friday. Here. Uh-huh. Oh, just a minute. Yeah. Bye. - [Sophia Voiceover] Oh my god, that was my first date since Dina. What if I bump into Dina, what would I say? It's a small city, I could bump into her, what would I say? - Hey, how are you? - How am I? Let me tell you. I have no one. My grandfather's underground, and you left me, without the decency of breaking up with me in person, because you're a coward. I wish that I could drop dead right the fuck now, so that you never had the opportunity to say goodbye to me. - According to white people, I look like I wanna be told I look like Jackie Chan. And here's the thing, I don't mind being told I look like another Asian, 'cause mistakes happen. What I do mind, being told I look like a 57 year old. (crowd laughs) Because that's rude! - Hi. - Hey! You gonna sign up? - It is Tuesday. - It is. What happened to your hair? - Hello. My name is Sophia Pinsky. So my grandfather just suddenly died. - I feel great. - I know what you're thinking, suddenly, suddenly, don't grandparents predictably die? It's like buying a goldfish. - Be positive. - You have seven days, and after seven days go by, boom, goldfish is bloated, floating at the top of the fish tank. - [Sophia Voiceover] I'm special. - Don't buy goldfish, cultivate ambivalence about your grandparents. (crowd chuckles) My grandfather was my favorite family member. The rest are my father, who's depressive, my alcoholic brother, and my international war criminal grandmother. - [Man] Very funny. - Could you actually, do you mind getting, just give me my bag. - Sure. - Thanks. (crowd laughs) Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Vladimir Putin. I know what you're thinking, he looks even more muscular in person. Because I wrestle bears. I also know what you're thinking. Hey, how does this man with such masculine confidence and manly stature, does he have any secrets? And the answer is yes. I like to stimulate my prostate. But everyone says that's gay. Americans think that's so gay. Gay, gay, gay, gay. Not gay. I am the most heterosexual man in all of Russia. I couldn't be gay, because we have the most beautiful women in all the world. Because a woman is beautiful when she cries, and our women are always crying. (crowd applauds) - Hey Spi, we're going to the diner, you in? It's open mic, I can't just turn people away. - That would be hitting rock bottom. - One day we won't have to do these mics, I'll be selling out stadiums like Dave Chapelle. I don't know where I'd be without it. Probably depressed as fuck, no friends, no aspirations. Getting a bunch of strangers to connect with you, like really connect, it's like an orgy of the minds. - Exactly. I once recited one of my poems on the T to a bunch of strangers. It's 'cause it was a shitty day outside, it was cold and gray. - I remember this. - And I got up in the middle of the train and I read a poem, without even a piano. And I would say it really landed. People thought what I was saying. One person even came to a bunch of shows afterward. - I remember that guy. - Yeah. I just need somebody to hear a line in one of my poems and say "Yes, that's the kind of sex I wanna have. "I'm a freak, too." - So what about you, what's your deal? - I don't know. It's a free place to go and you're all really nice. (upbeat electronic music) I don't know. I want to not give a shit, and you both live your lives in this objectively humiliating way. And I want that. Just trying to figure it out for myself. - That took some balls. - Can I have one? - Sure. - Good. - Damn it! I have to go to work. - Where? - I'm a barista as starfucks. See you later. - Bye, D. - Bye. - See you. - Maybe your family could come. My mom occasionally does. It's not really her thing, but she feels included. - No, no, no, no, no, no. - Why not? - They would never. And my mom doesn't live around here. - Where is she? - Parts of her are scattered across the Atlantic Ocean, and I have the rest of her in tupperware in my bag. - I'm sorry to hear that. - I've had decades to get over it, so there's no reason to be sorry. - It's still tough. - [Sophia Voiceover] She wants to have sex with me, right? Say you have nice eyes. - You have really pretty eyes. - That's us. - What are you doing now? - Going home. - To your house? - Yeah, where you going? - Same, home. - Do you need a place to crash? My girlfriend wouldn't mind. - No. I just went through a breakup. - Sorry. - It's fine, I just don't really wanna be around couples. - Course you don't. - Hey, but at some point, I'd like some friends. - Nope, sorry, got too many white friends as it is. I gotta cap it off at four, otherwise I start doing the Carlton uncontrollably. - Seriously? Do you have to go home right now? - Yeah. - See you next Tuesday? - [Sam] It's an open mic, you're in. (polka music) (vibrator whirs) (sighs) - Let me do it. Let me do it, I got it. (singing in foreign language) - Where's the sour cream? - Aisle one. - Can you get it for me? - No. - Do I have to force you to get it for me? - Is that enough? (yelps) - You can never have enough sour cream. (whoops) - Fuck! - [Sam's Girlfriend] So I hear you work at a store. - Yeah, what do you do? - I'm a merchandiser at Neiman Marcus. - Wow. So we both work at stores. I'm sorry, I really invited myself over. - I mean, it is your fantasy. - I can leave. (sighs) So sorry, I almost took this. Thanks again. - Whoa. - [Marina] Sophia! - Morning. - Uh-huh. - Why, what's wrong with these? Good morning. - You told me this. - I know, Baba. - Okay. - Here we go. - Don't worry. - Thank god for you. - Can I invite Trevor? - I like Trevor. I love Trevor. - Wow. - Okay. - Do you ever stop to think before you speak? Just now, I was gonna tell you that I blame you for everything that happens in this family that goes wrong. But I didn't, because I thought it might hurt your feelings. Your feelings. Other peoples' feelings. Have you ever heard of those? (somber guitar music) - Cut this up. - I don't want to. - Cut the chicken. - No. - You want to eat, then cut the chicken. - [Sophia] I'm not gonna cut the chicken. - Cut the chicken! - You cut the chicken! - I need a break. - Already! - Where did she go? - [Sophia Voiceover] Vicky. He's the only person I know who loves unconditionally, like a puppy. - Welcome home. - [Sophia Voiceover] So the fact that he loves me doesn't actually mean much. - Here, have some. - No thanks. - Hey, I know it's early and I need to stop drinking. - I didn't say anything. - I can stop when I need to. - What are you talking about? - I have a codependent relationship with alcohol, and I need to clean up my act if I'm gonna do the police exam thing. (chuckles) - What a moralistic, pathetic way to earn money. - I couldn't be more pathetic right now by anybody's standards. - Fuck off. - I'm becoming a cop because I really wanna be a cop. Do you care about what I want, does anybody care about what I want? - [Sophia Voiceover] I worry I'm becoming my grandmother. I should be so lucky, I'm not doing anything with my education, I work at a grocery store and she was a fucking doctor in the USSR. You don't know how lucky you are, boy. Back in the US, back in the US, back in the USSR. - I'm sorry. - Okay. - You wanna be a cop. - Right. - Okay. - Okay. - You're right. - Talk about moralistic. - Sorry. - What's going on with you? - Nothing. - What's going on with you and Trevor? - Absolutely nothing. - I knew it. - I'm fine. - You're fine, I'm fine, we're all fine. - Yeah, we're just not great. - Nope. - Go Sox! Yankees suck! (whimsical piano music) - Well, I'm gonna be a cop. - And I'm gonna be an adult. - [Sophia Voiceover] One piece of bread. Two piece of bread. Three. - Sophia. - [Sophia Voiceover] I want to kill myself. - Rabbi. - How are you, my dear? - Same as always. - Same as always, same as always. Consistency is a very undervalued quality. - [Sophia Voiceover] How do I kill myself? Maybe move to Russia so that Vladimir Putin can do it for me. - I've been thinking of you, my dear. - [Sophia Voiceover] Die, American faggot. No, no, no, I kill you, you American faggot. - Can I help you? - I kill you with my bare hands. - Listen, can you show me where the sour cream is? I'm in kind of a rush, I have a-- - I'll walk you down. - Sour cream emergency. - Ah. It's a pre-button, it's for a party this afternoon. One of the children of the board, and I had to get out of there, so I offered, the mother had so much on her mind. You should've seen her face when she realized that she'd forgotten the sour cream. And oh, one extra for Shabbat. - By all means. - You know it's a special Shabbat. - Is it? - Your grandmother invited me. I thought that was kind of her. - Yeah? She likes to feed people. Like barn animals. - You look like you could use one. - Oh yeah, thanks. Oh, oh jeez. Thanks. Can't have too much sour cream. - Ew. - [Sam] Pinsky. - What are you doing here? - I came to grab a can, mostly say hi, make sure you're not dead and such. - Nope, not dead. - You off? - Yeah, I got dinner with the Soviets. - Take notes. - I'll just be wallowing in my own self-pity, while I stuff my face with some soup and meat and wine. - Which way you headed? Same. What's in the box? - Napoleon. - I love that shit. - You want some, it's for Shabbat, fuck it. - You got something on your face. This cake. - What? - Nothing. - Hey! How much? - Hi. - Going home? - Yeah. - Want a ride? - No, it's okay. - What, are you gonna walk the whole way there? Get in the car. - [Victor] Are you sure? - Get in the freaking car, Vicky. - Okay. (horn honks) - Alright, go ahead. Thanks. Jerk. I have something to tell you. I'm pretty sure that it's meant to be, because you're in my car. (laughs) - Since I'm in your car? - Mmhm. Since I saw you walking near Harbor Street out of nowhere. - KK, I live near Harbor Street. - Whatever, Vicky, just listen, okay? - Okay. - I'm a virgin. - You are? I didn't know. - I'm a virgin, and I know that you know that I know that you're a virgin, too. (moans) But you don't have to be ashamed. - I am not ashamed. - Oh yeah, mama. (moans) (sighs) - I think we're meant to be together, Victor. I just know it. - Oh shit, let's go. (phone rings) Don't be such a scrotum. Just get up here, I need you to help me set some boundaries. What's your problem? - Look, I wanted to do it, but I can't. - What's wrong? - I just don't want to. - Because why? - I feel sick, I can't do it, okay? - What? - And this is so evil. - Evil? - Yeah, they're making this big meal in there, and you're gonna shit all over it, because you can't get over childhood or whatever? - Why are you making this all about you? - We've known each other since the fucking womb, and still, you couldn't give a shit about me. We go with years without speaking, because you treat me like I'm some kind of cousin that has nothing in common with you. But I'm the one who's gonna remember every catastrophic family dinner, every slight, every word that comes out of your mouth. I know your family, I know you. And you know we're all important, otherwise you wouldn't be here. Hello. - I'm just thinking. - Thinking what? - Thinking what Catherine would've thought of that speech. - Catherine who? Okay, fine, I made her up. - Just stop talking. - I'm sorry. - So stop. - No, it's fine, it's just, I didn't want things to get weird between us pretending, so I made something up. - Weird? What could get weird? - You know what could get weird. - Just leave. - I don't wanna leave now, I'm not done talking. - Oh, you're done talking. - I'm your person, Sophia. - My god, you're choking me, you are choking me. - You push people away, I'm not gonna let you do that. - Things are getting really creepy really fast. Can you just get out of my face right now? - Creepy? I'm not a stranger, Sophia. - Oh fuck. (speaking in foreign language) - I don't feel well, I gotta go home. (speaking in foreign language) - No. (group sings in foreign language) - Rabbi, some wine? - Oh yes, sure. - No, I forgot. - No one cares, I get it. - We all do. - Oh, you understood what I said? - Yep. I've been listening to tapes. Just practicing. - Adorable, you see that? - You're studying Russian? Why? (sneezes) (Rabbi speaks foreign language) - [Sophia] I'll do it. - That's a shame. Flowers remind me of Ilana. - All flowers? - Trevor, what's your problem? - I don't have a problem. - Nope. - Yes. - They can deal with that themself later. - Ilya, so how's work now? - Fine. - So are you gonna get yourself a new dance partner? - Man proposes, God dispose. - Well, he doesn't give you much, does he? - I have a lot on my mind. - He's clinically depressed, like all Pinsky men. - Like all Soviet men. - I'm not depressed. - Trevor, why don't you tell everybody about the concert we went to the other night, at Tops. Do you like music concerts, Sophia? - Do I like music concerts? Music concerts, could you be a little more specific? - Don't be a jerk. - What's with the grape juice, bro? - I went to an AA meeting today. - Is there something wrong with the car? - AA. - Not Triple A. Bob, it's time. - Marinachka, I don't think Victor was done talking. - I actually do have something to share. - Let me just jump right in. I remember picking up Marina on behalf of the temple when she arrived from Russia, right at the airport. Victor, you were just a few feet tall. It was a long time ago. I'm glad you started your recovery. I'm proud of you, son. I was still married then. Marina hardly spoke a lick of English. You were so young. I wanna tell everyone right now, your grandmother and I are seeing each other. - I'm dating the Rabbi. (laughs) - Well, Kiki and I are gonna have sex later, so good for us. - (laughs) He's not drunk? - Incredible. - Can we refocus our attention, please? - I'm happy. I would like to say a toast for my best friend. We've been together through thick and thin. You know me better than anyone, besides my various husbands. And I know you better than anyone else. Soul sisters, family, that's us. I wish for this relationship to be blessed. To be serene. To be full of love and appreciation. Kindness, romance, lovemaking. I hope that this relationship will inspire new relationship, marriages, love, and that our families would be bonded forever. - Were you talking about us again? - Yeah, Sophia and I are having issues. - The issue is that I'd rather get double-teamed by Gary Busey and Nick Cage than date Trevor. Everybody got that? - Who's Nick Cage? - Did I misunderstand something? You just said you are dating our Rabbi? - Wow. - You can't be alone with yourself for one second, can you? - Happy. Your husband just died. - Happiness is never wrong. - I've been in love, can you stop ignoring that fact? - I know what love isn't. Enter Trevor Selibovsky. We made the whole thing up, if that isn't abundantly clear already. - You could soften the fucking blow a little. - I could never date anybody like you. Who makes up having a girlfriend? A bisexual girlfriend. - Okay, everyone hear that? Just to clarify, everybody knows Marina and the Rabbi have been fucking for years, right? - Well, actually, Trevor, no, I don't think they did. - So you're saying my father died of broken heart? - No wonder, no wonder. - You motherfucker. That's mine, that's mine, that's mine! (group shouts) He's my fucking Rabbi, I can do what the fuck I want! - Jesus Christ, I didn't know! - I'm right about what? (classical piano music) Right about what? What, Baba? - I can give it to you, here. I didn't know, here. - My grandfather was the only one who had a moral bone in his body. The rest of you are self-serving, petrified victims. We're all in a mess because of this woman, and she can't even answer me. - Your grandmother loves you. You have to understand, we're, all of us, doing the very best we can at any given moment. - Do not patronize me. I've never even liked you. - Me neither. Me neither. - You want me to leave? (♪ "Baby" by DakhaBrakha) - Try some grape juice. ♪ Baby - It's all my fault. - It's way beyond you at this point. - Sure. ♪ Baby ♪ Show me your love ♪ Baby ♪ Show me your love - [Sophia Voiceover] She's right about one thing. I'm too old to be jumping on tables. - [Red Sox Fan] Go Red Sox! - Yankees suck! ♪ Show me your love (crowd applauds) - You know, I was thinking. - [Audience Member] Ow! - I was thinking, who is my favorite animal for a pet? And my favorite animal for a pet is Benjamin Netanyahu. (audience laughs) Because, let me tell you, excuse me. He reminds me of the wolf my grandfather gave me when I was seven years old. You know, BB came to my palace a few weeks ago. Yeah, he did. And we danced, we danced the whole night away, together. And I listened, I could hear his heart, because he's not a heartless man. He's a hero. I listened to that man's heart as he danced me all the way into my bed. As he danced me, I heard that beating beautiful heart. And he held me all night long. Caressed me. Held me tight. Okay. Maybe I'm a little bit bisexual. (crowd laughs and applauds) Just maybe. (polka music) Thank you. (singing in foreign language)
