people are fascinating i love hearing real people's stories hearing what motivates them what inspires them in this day and age we have access to more information about people than ever before we peer into these little windows and think we know people clinically narcissistic even people we've never actually met you can tell this is not a person that understands any issue deeply we feel so connected so informed technology has definitely opened new parts of the human experience but what's been closed off as a result we see in part we hear in part i know words i have the best words opinions are quickly formed not that there was any question but but this is pretty clear then confirmed by random humans we've also never met sergeant is a bigot a racist and racist person we think we know people uh is it balance problems is there some weakness there but do we really the american people by a fluke elected in imbecilic con man the lack of humility from donald trump he might order a nuclear weapons strike this might seem like such a basic question but how do we really know someone come on here i didn't even know that there was a human being named eric trump truth be told don't tell my husband that while promoting my last film i met laura trump as she shared her story i was amazed as an american i've heard more about the british royals than our current first family crazy and is it okay to say i'm surprised she was so normal well as normal as you can be while walking the dogs and feeding the kids in between filming segments for the news networks okay here we go guys good evening everybody and welcome to the right view i'm laura trump senior advisor to president trump's reelection campaign laura has since become my friend she's the trump i know is everybody ready to eat are you hungry luke yeah would you like to eat lunch yeah okay who am i i never in a million years would have imagined that i would be in this role or be part of anything like this what happened ladies and gentlemen oh thank you broccoli so it was very polite say thank you you're very welcome luke i was born and raised in wilmington north carolina same house i came home from the hospital to my parents still live in today i went to high school there i went to college at nc state in raleigh and then i expected like i got out of college and oh there would be a job waiting for me and that did not end up being the case um so i it's so long it's dirty i know it's okay um so i ended up waiting tables i was a bartender i was a part-time personal trainer for about two years after college i got to a point where i knew that there was something more that i wanted to do or there had to be something else out there so i decided one night on a whim to apply to culinary school in new york city so i found my apartment and my roommates on craigslist which my parents immediately thought well she's definitely going to be dead when she moves there if it's not bad enough i was fully gonna have like a movie night at home i was gonna relax and my roommate happened to have a friend in town and she begged me to go out with them and i was not gonna go out that night we went out one thing led to another and i saw this really tall guy the tallest guy for sure in the the place we were this this club downtown in manhattan and i thought to myself well tall guy blonde was into that and i was like okay and we hung out that whole night we had a great time and when we left that night somebody that was with our group of friends said something like well you know who that was you were hanging out with all night and i was like no and they said well that's donald trump's son i was like what first of all i i knew who donald trump was i think i knew about ivanka because i got like teen magazine or something back in the day and i'm pretty sure she was in that i didn't know about don jr eric's brother certainly didn't know about eric and i was like okay i didn't even know donald trump had a son but that's that's fine never really figured i would see him again and we got married on november 8 2014 which if you recall in 2016 november 8th was election day so that was our nice anniversary treat i had gone down to north carolina to a rally in my hometown of wilmington with my father-in-law he did what donald trump always does he asks people's opinions of things you know i was from the state and that was my hometown and blah blah blah so he asked me about the way things were being run one thing led to another and i i gave him my thoughts about things and he kind of like sat back and looked at me and i was like oh no either i said something really right or really wrong and he was like you know what i'm going to put you in charge of winning north carolina could you do that for me could you win north carolina i mean i had no idea about anything politics-wise i had no experience in any of this but of course i was there in the moment with my father-in-law and i was like yes of course i could win you in the state of north carolina so as soon as i got outside i called my husband and i was like i don't really know what just happened but i think your dad put me in charge of winning the state of north carolina um and important state very important and i had taken that day off of work it was like a tuesday or something and i'd taken it off of work so i had to go back to work the next day and i remember i went in and i talked to my executive producer and i was like um i'm pretty sure i'm gonna need to take a leave of absence for about three and a half months oh no what happened ma'am you want some more water come on luke let's go this way and now that people are out golfing the trick is to not get hit by golf balls while we're out here too or get in anyone's way yes obviously an important thing too this is generally fun when everyone's cooperative i mean a lot of the reason that i work out is to stay sane it's the one time of the day that i'm sort of by myself don't have to deal with anyone or anything else usually the best part out here is that they all know like i'm the crazy lady with the dogs and the kid or kids come on luke my mom comes up all the time hey my mom comes up all the time to help me with the kids um to stay with them if i'm out of town like over a weekend or something yeah well i didn't have kids in 2016. i have two now i think about all the time the fact that i'm not gonna be able to see my kids that much for several months in a row i'm sure and it's a temporary thing but at this age kids are changing growing so much now every time i facetime my son he cries of course which never makes you feel good this glimpse into the trump world made me curious how many more of these stories are there she invited the crew to tag along and find out as a member of the first family you don't just get in the car and go but i have to admit riding with the secret service was pretty cool are you going to get on the other side so it feels always very good to get back excited to be here and i come i'm back like once a week now once twice a week sometimes so yeah i saw him briefly yesterday did you see us hi every time luke hey can you say hi to mom hi ben hi charlie oh there's benjamin you're very handsome hey luke come here and give me a kiss i'll talk to you later i love you that was a better display recently when i've been calling him he's just been like hysterical like just burst into tears and lays down on the floor and cries so that was a better uh better show i got a couple of love use i don't have a key to get in here thank you sir how are you i just had a very uh nice breakthrough with luke when i called normally he's been like freaking out just hysterically crying right and he just he responded to me and oh hitting his face oh hello what did we have i have that off that calendar we were working on yeah oh i was going to ask you about that where is it where is it right now let's go to fox first because then we can yeah then we can make it and it's such a big issue they're all doing reopening schools mercedes reputation i think preceded her she has now worked in two different white houses and she was at the white house before coming over to the campaign raising the kids is my top priority one of the biggest stresses i have in my life is making sure i'm able to be there for my children and not miss out in their lives because it goes by so fast i mean matt the girls everyone has been so supportive of allowing me to work for this president and now work for the campaign well basically you just try to get uh more queens okay i don't know if you can cancel that one raise my children i think they're going to try to do the women bus tours every week almost i'm like literally like i looked at laura and i was like okay how are we going to do this okay so i'll just take a kid a kid a trip i think maybe i'm excited to just go out and see another state because i don't really get i've never seen wisconsin it's going to be interesting so yeah i'm just i'm excited freedom and spreading that message is what i feel called to do every day mercy fox news is calling okay all right why are the kids playing poker because your mother taught them how to play poker this is the path to victory to get independent and moderate voters on the fence in michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin let's welcome back to the show trump 2020 senior advisor mercedes it's always great to have you back on mercedes what are the far left policies the president is talking about here look i think you're seeing for example many of these liberal media outlets just criticizing and attacking the president for any move that he makes well when you look at the president's policies they're common sense policies that mainstream americans can agree with of the fakest rumors of all rumors the president didn't have women working for him and didn't like strong women do anything i mean i believe the president was the first one to ever hire a woman to build a building in new york and when i showed up at trump tower i met a whole bunch of powerful women and the women within the family including the president's wife people think that melania is just walking around beautiful what she is i had actually met melania and worked with her prior to even knowing the president she was very strong business wise knew exactly what she wanted and then as as i met laura and as i met ivanka and as i met other you know women in the um around the trump organization i found out that a lot of women were what makes this place tick every week we get some press inquiries you guys have no women on your campaign or um or women are never promoted or women are never senior staff there's always something somewhere along the way that the president hates women and doesn't value them it's just so not true we're not only like a majority senior staff female we're pretty much like a majority female staff overall being a working mom and and having the role that i do on this campaign i think just speaks volumes to how good of a man the president is how good of a family he has i mean they empower me so much not only to succeed at reelecting the president or run my department or be the best operative that it can be but they also empower me to be the best working mom that i can be i am like one of the only not moms on the campaign but at one point we had like two babies in the office like a month after and they just like stop in and i like well you know we'd hang out with kaylee or hannah's baby if they had a big meeting um but that's just that's a lot that happens here and they really believe like women can take charge can have a seat at the table you want to create an environment that women do feel that they have a voice they have something to say what you said about our campaign now almost 60 women i think it's important to note that wasn't because we wanted so many women this is because we hire the best people for the job it happened to be women and there are so many women you never get this narrative out there from the mainstream media but so many women that want to be a part of the president's campaign that want to be a part of this they tried to stop us from telling that story in 2016 and that's why i got out on the road with a bus full of women and said there are women that support donald trump well by the way talk about another strong woman ronna hi guys how are you sorry i just popped in for our meetings right now the chair of the republican national committee former stay-home mom only the president would say let's take that stay-home mom and have her run the party what a smart guy well by the way but this is another example i mean i didn't even yeah it wasn't even like in my my sphere but literally you have a woman in charge of the republican party under president donald trump it's always ironic that media trying to sell a narrative that's not true because they just say it enough times and and the fact they don't say they're strong women and women opinions of the trump administration i mean you have a lot of history with women kellyanne the first campaign manager you had sarah sanders who was the first press secretary with children i'm only the second woman in history to run there and see i mean he really has made a lot of history and when i see what what laura's done when i say what you've done rana you know in terms of i know your kids pretty well at this point and um i can tell you it's not easy i can tell you my wife has a substantially harder job than i might run a big company and i might be very involved with the campaign but you know you really do do a phenomenal job with kids and she is present and she will wake them up every single morning and she will be the first one changing their diapers and she will feed them and she will take care of them and she will organize all their activities and then she will be on the radio and the kids will be running up to her literally as you know she's on with some host and she'll play it off and she does it with glamour and grace and and beauty and just a funny story about that we were doing a conference call the other day and i was like who's taking a bath oh that was hilarious i was giving carolina a bath brad was like is someone in the bathtub we were on a zoom call and i left my phone on the counter so i couldn't mute it i didn't know everybody i have to say though i mean brad you all have been very supportive of the moms here at the campaign the mega moms you know that i've got five kids and it's you didn't stop from hiring me and how many women were pregnant all at the same time it was like between hannah and you and hayley at the time and i think that there was a lot of support that we get because i think you all value what we're able to continue i think it makes you stronger i mean i think it makes it makes you more relevant to understand as well like if we can't get moms what are we doing this for right and so that's what we're fighting you know we're fighting for every american family so we should have american families here i love the women of trump because they're such strong and powerful and opinionated women the positive message is not getting out to the public which is why we're doing what we're doing we do these tours to bypass the media to go directly to local and regional and talk about the accomplishment to the president it seemed odd to be the one telling the story about the women in trump's orbit why me was no one else willing to does it underscore the problem one sentence and you don't play the rest it's very misleading to the public mr trump talks about the policies of the middle east after the quote you just play from the rally i actually feel like i have three different lives i have my life of work i have my life of family and then i have my life we just got back from a bus tour which we're going to be having probably one every other week if not every week i love it and it's fun when we're doing it it's just craziness all the time and it's just sensory overload for me i have this routine and it's probably completely opposite of anybody else i come home i fall out on my bed for about 30 minutes just to decompress the events the the meetings and all the engagements because i know i only have about 30 minutes before the phone's gonna start ringing or the emails are gonna come in so is the round table at the church oh no we're leaving to go to the round table got it okay i'm i'm ready i've been on the plane but also like my brother-in-law don has been on the plane as well and we are not sitting together and so i can hear these people saying things about my brother-in-law and it's very hard because my reaction my initial reaction is that i want to get up and i want to get in their face and say like listen you've got this wrong like we're good people and what everything you've heard is not true out there but i can't do that i mean sadly if i did something like that i would seem i would be a crazy person and it would be just a ton of negative coverage but it's very hard i think it's really hard for anybody to hear information that they know is false and especially about people who you love and care about and you know really fight so hard every single day you know to to hear the media spread lies about you it's it's hard it's very frustrating like there are people in my grade who will literally like nudge me and be like i love trump because they know my parents and it's kind of sad because like now even kids are afraid to say like that they like trump because people will shame you people will and it's like it's kind of sad because it's hard to express who you are when everybody just if you don't think the same way as you they don't accept you should we turn up the volume to see what they're saying yeah hello everyone i hope you all had an enjoyable weekend i have some brief announcements for you today violence looting anarchy are not to be tolerated chris cuomo saying show me where it says protesters are supposed to be peaceful i'll give you an idea chris it's the constitution like i was just walking in watching cnn as they lauded the quote rallies in the streets are you saying the president got to let me finish jen this isn't a cable news segment i'm answering your question right now from the white house podium those people should be jailed the people you just mentioned i never said that those are your words not mine but perhaps you should look into it and give me some answers oh that's a very nice tie by the way thank you very much did anyone take it upon themselves to pose any questions about michael flynn unmasking the president obama's spokesperson oh not a single journalist has posed that question okay does president trump believe that it was a good thing that the south lost the civil war say what and i just want to leave you with a quote from martin luther king jr that we must learn to live together as brothers or we will perish together as fools thank i you know if these are the ones that she recommended something something is daddy making you oh my gosh that's it looks terrible i'm telling you do you have something other than the silver spoon i like that spoon that was given as a gift to us that doesn't look good what's daddy making you eat i've loved politics from kindergarten on it was just something that was innate i remember in college intern for congressman adam putnam um on the hill i interned in the white house actually um for president george w bush and i was in the office of media affairs and i remember distinctly the day i got to go to a white house press briefing and i got to watch dana perrino do a briefing and i was standing off to the corner and i remember looking at carl cameron who was the fox correspondent asking her questions and i would have never guessed that i don't know 10 years later so that i would be the one behind the podium my mom raised three kids and i always you know respected that she you know worked so hard to raise us and i guess i never truly appreciated it until i had a child of my own being a mom is truly the most challenging but the most exciting job in the world i think realizing just how much it entailed just really made me respect moms in general and my mom for sure my mom traveled the country with me with blake and while she was out all day blake and i kind of just stayed in the hotel room a lot of times a lot of the places it was really cold it was snowing outside so um we got to bond and it was beautiful it was an experience that i'll never forget shawn and i we didn't really take parenting classes we didn't read books well you read part of a book so when she came we were like just figuring it out on the fly hey pee it's okay i know she wants more food it's all gone there ain't any more food you can yeah you want me to do that when my food's over too yeah maybe just a little one good job maybe diaper time i don't know well we got stuff up there too say bye-bye it sunk in i was going to go take this new role and i mean i remember just holding blake actually right there and i just started crying and like literally my tears were like falling on her because i was so sad thinking about her not being with me all the time and then all of a sudden she lit up with what i think was her very first smile and it was just like her way of saying go do this mommy and god's way of saying i want you to do it so that's the first secretary are you okay yeah it was my phone oh okay so this is not blank programs for me to be a part of which was i worked with children's cancer groups which is really important to me at the various hospitals in san francisco like ucsf and it was a really rewarding experience kimberly guilfoyle i mean her background is so so impressive as a prosecutor she started dating my brother-in-law don and it was just a natural fit for her to come over to the campaign we were on a alligator uh hunt one time oh my goodness and then uh one of our friends dared dawn to go in and swim with the gators so of course he did it i mean i was like what is going on here i was i'm gonna have to dive in and like get him out of there and whatever gone so tough like his dad too i mean look every day is an adventure when you think about it they were trying to put him in jail and can you imagine you come home and it says uh don jr is guilty of treason punishable by death i was like well let's make tonight a good night because apparently according to cnn there he is singing your praises come sit for a second say hi rap one of the things i think that is so important when people really see and they resonate they understand and feel a little bit closer to the president because they get to meet don interact with them very personable and out there fighting for his father and i think it shows you look how much he loves his dad and his family and willing to sacrifice against incredible odds with everybody coming after him and he's really been besides his father the you know biggest target and i want to retire and let kimberly just fight for me it's so much easier she does such a better job anyway i just know when to get out of the way uh you know between honestly you know just between you know my mother my sister my daughters kimberly you know the your grandma the grandma they're all very just you know impressive women you know just you know go-getters you know very alpha uh you know and they just do it and so uh it's awesome to see and my father's really surrounded himself by them his entire life 30 years before other people were doing the same thing because he sees competence uh and he rewards it president donald j racist is a person who they bigot and is in the white house his comments about those women were racist it seems to me like the president will not be happy until there is not one single female republican voter in the country he was lauded all over the world as one of the greatest businessman men of all times and then all of a sudden he decides to run for president and it switches and you have people coming after you like i really don't think any president has had to deal with the media did the best that they could to try and rebrand him because before the 2016 campaign donald trump was a beloved american icon internationally known 100 name recognition hollywood star right and then all of a sudden he's running as a republican and he's the enemy he's the devil he's a russian spy i mean these are all the crazy things that came out after donald trump the good news is he had 40 years of a brand these same people who are trashing him on these news networks for the same people that wanted to attend parties with him without derek zoolander male modeling wouldn't be what it is today excuse me where's the lobby down the hall and to the left thanks mr and mrs donald trump it's the donald oh my god when you look at donald trump the man who has a documented record out there that the entire 80s has been erased the entire 90s have been erased donald trump's history was never brought up between the 80s and 90s with regards to race or women or people would have to acknowledge the fact that it was donald trump who worked with jesse jackson and there's video of jesse jackson himself praising donald trump for being a builder of communities and a builder of people praising donald trump for the space that he gave to black men to help them get involved in wall street i do want to express thanks to you donald trump for being with us tonight he is a man that sees potential he doesn't see race he doesn't see gender he sees potential he sees people he's humbled um that he's given this job that so few in the history of our country can say they've had he's enjoyable to be around and it's not surprising because i think when you watch his rallies it's he's enjoyable to watch and i think just to see behind the scenes that he is the same person he is in front of the cameras that he's just as funny behind the scenes and it's not the case i think with every president where there's this scripted image of who the person is out here and then who he is behind the doors of the oval office is a complete mystery this is the same person what do you want to be that's a good idea so you want your own business and you're going to make a lot of money right but don't run for politics after you leave he will probably be the only president to come out of office with less money than when he went in because he's not doing this to write a tell-all book his memoir we all know donald trump already we've always known him the trump winery sits on the monticello wine trail just outside charlottesville virginia carrie woolard manages the property she offered to show us a round via the scenic route i don't think there's a lot of turnovers there's a lot of exits just never know there's a rest stop right here it's kind of fun up here yeah i'm sure i've had great ambitions of being a doctor which is what i wanted to do since the time i was a little little kid moved to charlottesville and worked at a winery for what i thought was just going to be a year i was loving what i was doing in the wine industry and and here i am when trump purchased the property it was in receivership so it was quite distressed this is their first winery and they needed a bit of help so they asked some of the experts in virginia who would you recommend who can help us here to really bring this place back to where we know it can be and in doing so my name came up a couple different times so eric um got my number actually called me at work uh to to which i told him that i really couldn't talk to him while i was at work but if he gave me his number i would call him back so later that evening i called him back a couple days later i was on a plane to new york to interview and i i think like less than a week later you know i had a cell phone in an email and had given notice and um was already you know starting to work on the project here before i was even officially in an office there's women in the company that i look up to and have since i started you know i've been here eight years and even when i began there are women and that are that still work in the corporate office who have been with him for 20 years and 25 years and they're women who have accomplishments beyond what most people would imagine we ask that you would bestow upon our president the wisdom necessary to lead this great nation the grace to unify us and the strength to stand for what is honorable and right in your sight i've been in his life 19 years i was in my office and they said to me mr trump's on the line i was like yeah yeah sure i thought they were playing around with me so they're like paula mr trump's on the line so i get on and sure enough his receptionist robin answers and picks up and said mr trump would like to speak to you i hear this distinguished voice that most people you know have had some kind of knowledge or some kind of you know have heard about so he said to me i've been watching you on television he told me how he was confirmed presbyterian how his mother was a very godly woman and praying woman how he grew up going to saturday and sunday school then he would talk about i went to see dr david jeremiah or how his dad took him to dr billy graham crusades and he loved selves loves dr billy graham he was really drawn to the passion and the move of god and the spirit of god so he said well when you're when you're up here why don't you stop by the office so i did and i thought you know this will be a waiting line or this way and he was just so accommodating and so this actually became very regular in routine so whenever i was ever in new york you'd say stop by and i think well he's going to kick me out of the office you know or something and i'd stay there for thinking five or ten minutes and i'd end up sometimes being there for hours and i'm like just a fly on the wall and it was it was quite fascinating to me how much he had been formed by several things um and faith being one of them so we are headed down into the barrel cave between the oak and the wine and oh my it smells amazing when you come in here come in here taste a little wine check in on see how everything's aging and go from there 2019 was a great vintage virginia it's going to be one of the banner vintages i think we've had it was only the second time that he had visited the property so i was a little bit nervous you know i was still new to the company and it's strange to say that he's down to earth but he is very down to earth and has this ability to make you feel at ease very quickly it was just uh eric mr trump myself so just the three of us so we're going in and out of every building getting in and out of the car dozens of times and mr trump opened my car door for me every single time we stopped and got out of the car and it got so almost embarrassing that at one point throughout the day i actually let out a little bit of a giggle like i think it was just a nervousness and i was embarrassed and i was like oh my gosh i'm so sorry and you know and he looked at me and he was just like absolutely not like that is just what i do it's always what i'm gonna do we had a huge painting crew and he wanted to meet them and even further than just shaking their hand and introducing himself he actually stopped to ask me if it was okay first i think it's very clear that it is who he is to the poor without cameras without people looking no one's around no one to impress so that that's the mr trump that i know all right if we can't do anything on the west wing obviously we could come over here on the from the east wing um like i i'm in the waiting area like that i forgot the room it's officially called laura arranged for us to get a few words from the president himself turns out he's a pretty busy guy while waiting for the boss i met a few of the women who lead their departments within the white house starting with stephanie grisham this is us in the oval office mrs trump was filming a psa i felt like there was a hair out of place so i stopped everything and she thought it was hilarious because i was trying to fix her hair and i love this picture because it's it catches her she's she laughs all the time she's got the best sense of humor i think it says a lot about both of you and your relationship together it's pretty cool i think so i got a call from somebody saying donald trump is coming to town would you mind working a rally because i had worked for romney doing advanced work for him and i kind of thought oh oh it's donald trump and i love the apprentice so this will be just fun to watch after seeing the energy in that room and after seeing how he packed the room that wasn't look again it was donald trump that early but the things he said and he was just so authentic and for me in my life to see him be so authentic meant a lot to me and the first time i met him he he asked about me he asked about my family and there's there was no judgment and he seemed genuinely interested and so i called all the other candidates after that and i said i'm i'm done i'm gonna go work for him and here i am after that we met up with kellyanne conway the most important role i'll ever have is mom and i've been blessed with four children who are now teens and tweens they have sacrificed mightily for mom's job in the public eye and i'm trying to do my very small part to help improve the lives of people who don't have voices and don't have choices and they never felt like they mattered or that somebody was giving them voice and visibility because typical political speak and politicians would promise them the sun moon and stars and deliver very little and that's just a way to get votes donald trump rolled the dice he he didn't need this job i mean the idea that donald trump became the president is truly remarkable on many levels for many reasons but to bring that businessman's perspective the problem solver the crisis manager the person who needs to have tangible results he's a builder he can't just talk about building he can't just have a commission of architects talk about what the building may look like no you have to build the building and all that that means so that people can walk into it and work and live and that's been such a remarkable refreshing aspect of this presidency while we were there kaylee texted and introduced us to alyssa farah who then gave us a tour of the eisenhower building i know you've had several roles on the hill and even within the white house here itself first time you met the president if you remember that the first time that i met the president i was working for the vice president mike pence i was so nervous i he came into a roosevelt room meeting that the vice president was leading and he turned to me and said hi smiley i'm guarantee he does not remember that to this day but i was smiling so wide because i was just excited to see him um but now i've got to spend quite a bit of time with him it's i i remember this every day as i walk on a campus just to stop say a quick prayer of thank you and gratitude that i get to be there and that i get to serve this particular president um he's a remarkable man the more time you spend with him behind closed doors the more you understand what makes him such a strong leader for our nation we also met with brooke rollins who's been with the president since his campaign i'm not sure quite how it happened but every day i along with all of my colleagues we pinch ourselves because we believe we have the greatest job at the most important time in our country's history and so to stand alongside this president at this point in time and fighting for the very soul of america is is a gift that defies any sort of definition or explanation but one that we all understand uh is beyond anything that we are ourselves and part of something so much bigger we found out the president needs to push our meeting back a bit back to the waiting room i guess i was tired and i think a lot of people are tired of watching other countries ripping off the united states this is a great country country's losing 200 billion dollars a year when i build a building a lot of the material has to come from china because well that's different right no it's terrible because of the united states david it's terrible i wish it weren't so but they manipulate their currency and they make it very very hard to buy products in this country and with good leadership you could stop that immediately my father-in-law got continually frustrated i think by what he saw happening in so many cases across this country and he kept saying like this isn't right this isn't how it should be done and i know people have talked to you about whether or not you want to run would you would you ever i probably wouldn't but i do get tired of seeing what's happening with this country and if it got so bad i would never want to rule it out totally i think the radicalism of the obama years and the kind of tearing down america really ripped at him he begins to call me pastor in early those of us who are christians in a ministry understand that's quite a step that's quite a step so that says quite a bit for him to ask me to break bread with him open the word with him pray over him pray for his family seek god calls me over to the office and he said i want you to pray i said about what he said i'm thinking about running for president this is 2011. and i said okay he said i really need to hear from god and he said i've got to make a pretty big decision he said paul can you bring some people around to pray so we did i brought about 20 people 20 pastors that i'm very close to or new and we went there to trump tower we prayed for six hours he wasn't in there the entire time but almost the entire time and it wasn't about can you know get get people around me i want to know what they have to say i want another opinion not at all it was pure unadulterated um seeking god what does god have to say so the next morning he calls me over and he said paula what do you think god's saying i mean i remember and i'm not a real you know teary type of girl at all and i remember this tear coming down barely i said it's not the timing but i knew that he was going to run and be president i knew it in 2011 and i said as a friend as someone that i care about little did i understand what i was saying then i said i hate to see what you would go through i said but our nation will need it one of my favorite memories that i have was actually having dinner in the 21 club in new york with mr trump and eric and then governor mcauliffe who was the governor of virginia who was you know part of the dnc with the clintons and so mr trump was asking tons of questions and expressing his frustration and i remember sort of sitting there in fascination and in awe of what i was able to be a part of and listen to and i should have had clued in that night that that's what was coming so my father-in-law's birthday happens to be flag day june 14th and if you remember he announced he was running on june 16th so we all went to have dinner with him at bedminster at the the golf club for his birthday and it was at that birthday dinner when he really said to all of us this is this is real i i want to do this but i'll never forget what else he said because he said this isn't just about me this is about our whole family and there's no way that somebody runs for president and they don't drag everybody in so i need to know from you of course that you guys understand what that means and that everybody is on board and i kind of think if any one of us had said like maybe we're not into this i don't know necessarily we wouldn't have done it but i think we could have had a conversation about it nobody even hesitated we said absolutely we're on board but i remember he also said charlie get off he also said now they're going to come after us they're not going to make it easy there's going to be lies written about us they're going to say all everything they can politics is a nasty business but i think this is the right thing to do wow was he right on that right oh my gosh i get a phone call i was in my kitchen in florida he goes up paula what you doing you know how are you and i said i'm great sir how are you and he said i'm running for president and you're going to oversee faith and i thought and with all due respect of course he knew what he was doing but i thought i certainly don't know what i'm doing the american dream is dead but if i get elected president i will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before and we will make america great again thank you thank you very much everybody knew donald trump but then when he came out and started talking like we all talk and saying the things that we were all thinking and and speaking about the things that were sort of under the surface that no one wanted to address but they weren't right and we had to fix them people i think for the first time in a long time had hope that things would change there was something going on and it was very reminiscent to me as a tea party person when we started out with 200 people at an event and ended up with 34 000. it was like that energy was back and but this time we had a leader which republican candidate has the best chance of winning the general election of the declared ones right now donald trump that was the moment that everyone said was impossible according to the experts the pundits the whole group of them hillary clinton has a 100 chance of winning over 60 percent of republicans aren't going to vote for donald trump if trump does win the party's nomination he claims he won't stand a chance against hillary clinton you have to understand he cannot win going into this night where do we stand 268 to 204 so clearly an advantage for secretary clinton we have our first woman president soon to be hillary clinton elected president of the united states but the vote is sacred until the people speak we don't celebrate it was so late and nobody wanted to call anything i called eric and i said i need you to come down to my office i need to show you something eric kind of leaned on the computer and i'm sitting there and i go look right there that's the moment the data crossed the line and eric was like you're serious and i was like yeah we won this was election day i said now it's just a matter of time of of waiting for it to all come in and for everyone to believe it when it became very evident that he was going to win and he started quickly working on the acceptance speech and still hadn't heard from hillary clinton and everybody was like well where's hillary the president is in the dining room somewhere outside the kitchen staircase camera exactly whereas i walk up to him i said sir i have the raw data we want you want sir and he was like oh they called it yet they called it and bannon's standing next to me and kelly and they're like they haven't called it yet on cnn or asia i said i have the raw data our team says you have won it's just a matter of time now i would get ready to go but nobody had heard from her and and everyone kept saying well look until she calls and concedes and says like you won we can't officially say like that that you won this election my father-in-law said well we can't just leave these people there these people have been there for like 12 hours look at how close he is right now he has 257 electoral votes he needs 13 more 270 to be elected president of the united states and dana he is getting incredibly incredibly close jake and the wall comes tumbling down i mean this is this is truly the beginning of the end for hillary clinton's campaign associate press still won't call it they're double checking their numbers if you look at this again let's go pennsylvania 97 hold on one second i want to go back to general right now diana what are you learning you know well if i have wolf i have a little bit of information but i just want to be sure that i have it right that's why i reported to you so go back and talk to john we were backstage as we were you know he was preparing to go out there and i'm so mad i actually went to the bathroom i know i went to the bathroom and i was like i've got i've got to go just real quick so i ran to the bathroom and as i'm coming back everyone is like huddled around him so i kind of like squirmed my way through i was like what's going on and my husband said it's hillary and i was like oh my gosh and he was in the middle of a conversation with her and it was very cordial i mean they they've known each other for years i mean maybe 20 years and he hung up the phone and we were all just kind of there with like baited breath like well like what happened and he said well it's official that's it let's go do it decision desk has called this means that donald trump will be the 45th president of the united states winning the most unreal surreal election we have ever seen it is my high honor and distinct privilege to introduce to you the president-elect of the united states of america donald trump thank you very much sorry to keep you waiting complicated business complicated to get to that moment to realize that it was it was real that he had won the presidency literally defying all the odds out there i mean there was just a moment of of sort of shock for all of us because although we felt it we've been even been beaten into us like i think so many people in this country that there was no chance for donald trump now it's time for america to bind the wounds of division have to get together to all republicans and democrats and independents across this nation i say it is time for us to come together as one united people we probably got home at like 4 30 in the morning or something didn't get much sleep and i mean we couldn't sleep like how do you sleep after that i pledge to every citizen of our land that i will be president for all americans and this is so important to me i guess it was just surreal you are go go go go go constant like work and work and working hard and fighting and fighting and then you get to this moment and we're sort of like okay now like what do we do now now what maybe he's dealing with china i feel like ultimately the rule of law needs to be followed by a president and this president has shown a contempt for the rule of law and seems to kind of i think it's fairly obvious that he's violated the constitution in a number of ways i think that president trump has demeaned the office disgraced the office of the president i would say at least a weekly if not a daily basis the number of inaccurate unfounded stories written either about me my husband the trump organization clearly the president when you look at the media's approval rating which is often very low it's the american people recognizing that there was a harvard study done of the president's first hundred days in office and they found that he got historic negative coverage historic this is trump world everybody in it is a liar it's really the beginning of the end the beginning of the end he may be feeling the walls closing in on him all the walls closing in on him the walls closing in on him he is a liar there was just so much lying tonight one astrologer says this means the beginning of the end for president donald trump the beginning of the end of the trump presidency uh he's a bigot it is racist he's a narcissist he's always hated women to me it's just people being gullible is this the tipping point i know we've said it over and over you think this is a tipping point and over and over this is a tipping point and over and over the trump family is a criminal enterprise obstruction of justice obstruction of justice obstruction of justice obstruction of justice obstruction of justice this is the beginning at the end the beginning of the end the walls are closing in the walls closing in an obstruction of justice to an obstruction argument this is a very dramatic day and i think it might be near a tipping point do you think this is a tipping point it's all so sad 93 negative media coverage it's just a saturation from the mainstream media skit's done on saturday night live where boy kate mckinnon captured me perfectly i've had a bad hair life here to help make sense of this is trump senior advisor kellyanne conway thank you jake happy to be here and then donald trump won and then it all changed i remember we used to go at inside edition over to trump tower like once a week to get a sound bite from my father-in-law about whatever the the topic of the day was you know because he always had an opinion that he would share part of the reason they were killed was incompetence under this administration it was just so interesting how quickly it shifted and it became hard for me because these producers that would write the stories and and you know cut pieces together for a show that day who i knew very well they knew that i was going to see this stuff would choose the worst photos of my father-in-law would take you know his words out of context and i would go back to their edit base and be like guys i know we've got a better picture than that of the pres of donald trump like please i know that you know what he said let's play the full clip there but that became really hard for me because i wasn't used to that feeling that like i was being like our family was being attacked my father-in-law was being attacked and i didn't like it when congressman elijah cummings calls you a racist your reaction is what well i think the word has really gone down a long way because everybody's called a racist now uh her own party called nancy pelosi a racist it's all about guilt and it's all about trying to destroy who you are as a person from 2016 to now there's this narrative you know donald trump is racist the sexist the misogynist of course he's a racist i have no examples for you but he's definitely a racist like just because everyone knows i don't have to explain it because everyone knows it's so ridiculous right i have a little sister she's 12. so she's a young latina woman look at this girl this is like how this is what her concept of a president will be framed at 70 percent of americans say a racist xenophobe misogynistic but here's what it all boils down in the white house how is he like how's working on the campaign it was just like did he like black people yes i'm here racist sexist misogynist i even pointed to myself on the tv screen during a cnn interview once because you just have to be deaf dumb and blind to believe that when you look at donald trump's history and you see the number of women that he's empowered when you see the number of minorities that he's empowered i've seen the attitudes of changing our communities people are just hopeful again you can't deny the historic first step back criminal justice reform that should have been done a long time ago i've met some racist in my life donald trump is not one of them how are you so what's your experience in front of the world donald trump's closest advisors are women but that is something that gets lost about this man all the time it has never mattered what someone looks like their gender anything about their background to donald trump his number one question is can you get the job done for me and a lot of times women can get the job done and he knows that some of the smartest most talented women that i have seen are people who work for or around president trump he loves killers he tells me all the time kimberly you're a killer we like to tell other countries that they need women's empowerment and gender equality and all these things but we look to our own selves and we see we've never had obviously a female president every time in 2016 i got that question about you know well you're a woman wouldn't you want a woman to be the president of the united states it made me more and more angry that people legitimately thought that was a reason to vote for somebody i mean i can't think of a worse reason to vote for a person than what they they look like people just want to be treated like people and respect it as such and just because i'm a woman doesn't mean i'm going to vote for a woman if she wants to destroy everything about my femininity he chose me for the positions i have because he believes in me and he believed i had the best ability to be able to fulfill these roles that's actually respectful to women i don't want a job because of my gender i want the job because i'm the best person for that position you know i have gut instinct okay and we're allowed to have that and i looked at her and she asked a question and it was a very positive question she looks like she's got a great look and she's look at that with the tears how nice she's just a good she just seemed like a good person to me the attacks are difficult um and it isn't necessarily difficult for me and i think for the the ladies and the gentlemen frankly that we work with but for our families the thing where it gets hard and is troublesome and worrisome or you know the people on social media those people are you know a little much um you know i just don't understand where they get off saying something like that to somebody that they don't know um you know they don't know her they don't know anything about her don't know me and you know they just the personal like attack on your family you know it's just like you know a fan you know in the stadium or whatever they mouth off and it's the same thing you can't say anything back if you hear it you hear it and move on for me i mean when i see people attack me it doesn't faze me it motivates me it just makes me want to do my job even better we take our elections seriously and we believe in election integrity justin i was not on the call caitlyn stop filibustering justin let your colleagues ask questions like the book i asked her well she's here for this purpose she's doing a great job and she's fighting a fight that's worth fighting and uh very very proud yeah very proud you just tell her to keep as all you s keep people with the truth everything else is easy right you tell the truth the truth wins out always goes all right ladies and gentlemen quick question before we get started who here is ready for four more years of donald trump thank you for everything thank you for everything tell him i said thank you for everything i would often tell him the stories that we would hear out on the road and he loved hearing them and he referenced them sometimes in interviews he did or in speeches that he gave and it's not just the the write in the person's name joe the plumber stuff these are people who really told me their stories with tears in their eyes and poured their hearts out to me and they did the same to him he actually not only would go and talk to waiters but i feel like he would seek out people like the janitorial staff or the housekeeping staff right because those people don't generally directly interact with the management all the time and that he knew he would get the real truth from those people and like whatever so he would want to get like the low down on everything from them and he would go straight to them and ask how how's everything doing and you know how are we doing how do you feel like everything's going anything we can improve on what are you seeing what are you hearing we're staying in this kitchen and the wait staff is just waiting and so trump looks over to the guy that's about to go out and wait on tables he goes so what do you think about all this and he looks at him and he's like me so he he literally talks to the wake staff the elevator people i mean everywhere we went he was always talking to the people who who themselves thought shouldn't be in front of anything he remembers the farmer's face he saw in iowa and the farmer who he met backstage and he remembers the auto worker in michigan and he remembers them and he's taken i think those faces with him to washington and has not allowed him to sink into the washington swamp like unfortunately a lot of republicans do and he has for somebody who's been incredibly successful in business this unique ability to connect with the ordinary man and woman he's just a really good guy who loves this country and i think just seeing how the reporting of who he is was so wrong was just really jarring you have folks who have leaked for whatever purposes they do and create this image that it just is no bearing in truth and it's quite interesting too because a lot of people that now you know kind of come against him publicly i saw many of those same people in his office quite often people ask me all the time why does he why does he tweet and it takes everything so personal and i said well because it is personal when people you've known your whole life who know your heart who know you're not racist or sexist or misogynist are now on the airwaves trying to poison people who don't know you that is personal and it should be personal i researched i went way back and i found that 30 years prior mr trump at the time was speaking about all of the issues that were still relevant well this is like my second bible and you can see how it's all marked and annotated and because i was going uh all over virginia and even debating at people who were cruising for somebody else and they would say well trump said this or trump said that well all of the answers were here and so all i had to do was turn to this say no you're wrong i started virginia women for trump right here in my living room with 22 very enthusiastic women and it grew from there we're out there we're engaging with everyone that we meet practically he really cares not just you know for this country he cares for others other countries around especially for a christian persecuted as me a daughter of coming from um iraq baghdad the christians were persecuting all four decades back in 2016 when i first attended one of his rallies i was very lucky to be at the very close to the studio and i had a made-up sign says iraqi christians voted for trump to win so as he arrives i followed up and opened it up and as through his speech he pointed at me and mentioned that we're going to do better for the country we're going to restore law and order and make sure we will protect the christians there that's where he immediately gave us a big hope and i touched my heart and i felt that i'm talking to the person speaks out of his heart doing this because you know for the next generation my children life my grandchildren and you know their children some american people they say oh america never greek i mean i think that because they never been outside of the country so they don't know sometimes when we travel around the world we come back and we want to kiss the crowd because we say oh my god thanks god we are back even though i didn't born here but i i always feel i'm american as the bus traveled through pennsylvania i stopped by my favorite city philadelphia these are the halls where imperfect men first declared the words that toppled empires and ancient ideologies people could rule themselves self-government was born here this is the birthplace of america it just so happens to be my birthplace here we are in kensington allegheny down in philadelphia this is the house that i was born to stayed here at 12 5 found me with a very rough situation when i was five the police came in separated my mother and my two sisters and myself from this house and then we never came back we never saw our dad again after that night we were just kind of living on the streets and my sisters found a sign on the side here that said sunday mornings free dunkin donuts and orange juice so we would come here probably for uh several months in a row never with our mom just with my sisters while we were here a gentleman noticed us and noticed that we didn't dress well and that we didn't have any adult with us and uh took it upon himself to find out our situation and one day he he walked along the streets to find out what house we were living in basically an abandoned house and that's when he was discovered us and took us to uh this orphanage he was doing a a project with growing up i never dreamed i'd be where i am today a beautiful wife kids of my own and now working in the film industry making movies but isn't that what we are fighting for where a regular joe like me and rise up out of a place like this isn't that america we're back donald trump and robert kiyosaki define rich develop rich is a state of mind more than anything else if you feel you're rich and if you're happy and you have a wonderful family you're rich and this doesn't just have to do with money he wants every person in this country to have the chance of the american dream and everyone who comes to this country they work hard that's what he wants he wants opportunity for everyone he always loved america because america he felt gave him this great opportunity and it was a place where people could move from queens to manhattan uh miami and kansas can come to dc you can you can live your dreams and he realized that my dad was so happy and proud when he was able to uh get my mom a house like in the suburbs and a front lawn you know and it's things like that that you know you understand the value of hard work and be able to provide for your family to be able to live your american dream having that equality of opportunity not necessarily a result but you have the chance i became the first black woman to represent a republican presidential campaign winning presidential campaign in united states history which is huge i'm a black single mother coming from poverty having nothing or no one no support system no connections and no pedigree and he gave me the opportunity of a lifetime only a fraction of people will ever get to work for the president of the united states and i became one of them and that is the donald trump that i know have we been so conditioned to believe the worst about people have we lost the ability to recognize a good thing when it's staring us right in the face there's sort of the public persona of who donald trump is who's this you know brash celebrity businessman that we've all seen in you know our homes for the last two decades but there's this side of him that is this incredibly calm sort of father-like but deeply serious man who cares about the american people i believe i'm portrayed in a rougher sense than the actual product and i hope that's true because i hope the actual product is a lot more mellow than the portrayal he's just raw he's real he's going to tell you what he thinks when he thinks it and if he changes his mind he'll tell you that too normal political motivators did not apply to him people looking for status fame power money he had all of that he sacrificed so much of it to do this job we love our slightly flawed candidate because we're all slightly no matter what he says it could be the greatest thing in the world but there are so many people out there and it's sad because if they got on board and really just for took a breath and said well let me just actually listen for one moment and see what's really here instead of just having a prejudgment about somebody and then just in their mind making it up you know it's it would be a lot easier for them and i bet that they would find that they really enjoy the president and they have really benefited from a lot of what he's done but there are some you'll never convinced nobody made any effort sorry let me i did thank you so much thank you darling i'll remember it really means a lot to me it really does that you take that and all my son loved this country very very much and he gave his life painfully never cried out in pain or anything like that asked that his men be taken care of and and what rank was he in he was a staff sergeant not a general not anything like that just a staff sergeant a platoon sergeant now again we have a man of the people most unlikely man of the people from you know new york city um very very successful but yet in the best way a man of the people who himself had lived the american dream and who now just wants to make sure everyone else has the same shot i want to thank you guys all for coming i especially want to thank our guests for coming in and that lovely pink truck that everybody's gonna see thank you all for joining us i have five girls okay talk about women for trump i think i should i think i should have daughters for trump bus at this point and alyssa is here and she's our number three right she's very excited to be away from the sisters and i wanted her to be able to meet the great people of wisconsin because it's important for her to know and understand that the heart of america is about people who love this country america is not about violence america is not about hatred america is not about division it is about freedom and love and patriotism and you all embrace that every day of what you're doing talking about socialism 14 000 kids who came like me in this country without parents and we were provided an opportunity this is what makes our country great i was in florida last week with the president for a round table with vanessa and cuban leaders and i met um some workers that were that were nearby and they were talking to me about their concern of seeing people tearing down the violence and seeing people tearing down these statues in the streets like ali this is how it started in venezuela this is how it started in cuba they're like people championing these policies promising you things that they can't deliver on promising this government's gonna fix everything for you and then taking control of the people they're empty promises they weren't delivered on and they destroyed countries economies cultures and we can't let that happen here this behavior that started with riots and you know tearing down vandalizing businesses statues all the government building this is the beginning that we've seen back home this is the beginning to destroy the nations it's gonna get worse and worse if we're not gonna stop it now you know that's a history right there and now they trying to destroying it freedom is just so fragile and it really can change in a whim a woman called tara durant took her young daughter on erin's downtown as the two tried to drive home a mob surrounded their vehicle and blocked it from moving several people jumped on durant's car and screamed obscenities at her child i'd taken my daughter to home depot we were doing um a little renovation project we had a really good time and we were coming back i realized i've come to a protest and these protesters were occupying this intersection all around it was probably close to 30. they started to swarm around me and they started to swear at me they started to you know you do affordably offensive gestures and that's when i called 9-1-1 they're on my car all right they're on my car right now so we would suggest you slowly drive through the area don't hit anyone with your vehicle i cannot get out of here okay patient go i'll let the officers know okay are you serious we can't do anything now the city told us that this is a sanctioned event get out of my car you know this is gonna get dangerous i got a case here yes ma'am it was just that you call it city hall to let them know about your frustrations this is getting scary as i'm getting more upset so two protesters jumped onto they're on my hood they're on my car if i proceed slowly they're going to attack me they're going to attack my car if i go fast and use dangerous force i'm going to hurt or kill someone and i got a little girl in the car crying are you kidding me she was afraid that they were gonna get into our car they were gonna hurt me or kill me a motorcyclist came up and he all of a sudden the people's kind of parted and he's gesturing at me horrifically just saying get the f out of here get the f out of here and i stared at him i thought did he just save me or what happened you can't be threatened and assaulted or battered and say call city hall that's not civilized society that's not our country my father was very successful i mean he came from nothing and built these businesses and owned his house and he was going somewhere all of a sudden when castro came into power you can see disintegration destruction division happen in a country so fast it was a story of starting their lives over again in this great country that embraced them that really took them in and my father always says you know he left cuba with just an apple in his pocket and leaving everything just think about this you leave everything behind no matter how many times i hear that story i always get emotional like when my mom told that cpac like she has told me the story so many times and when i was a kid like i didn't really know what it meant like i was kind of like oh well it's like freedom but now i realize like how important that is to us and when she told it at cpac actually um recently um i started crying and everyone looked over at me and i was just like because i just it's so terrible what happened to him and i know every time he tries to tell us like he gets emotional he can't even tell the story it's that bad and that's how precious our freedom is it's it's so important that if we lose it we lose so much more than just our freedom it's a choice between two visions of america and two different visions on how your life would either be more in the hands of the government or more in the hands of you the whole concept of self-governance right where you usually have a monarchy or a dictator the whole idea of america 250 years ago was that that doesn't work as well as a government structure where we elect our own representatives and they represent the people not the institutions and i think that got lost along the way and i think that this president represents the people not the establishment not the institutions not the lobby not a political party he represents the people no one could have predicted the chaos that would ensue with the trump candidacy i mean the level of vitriol and hate and now even violence i knew that it would get pretty bad because when you take on the establishment regardless of the party there's there's going to be some problems people don't just give up power or control of a 20 trillion dollar piggy bank it's just not easy it's a very slender minority of hateful marxists who are trying to rip everything down and they really intimidate people into silence if you're in the creative community and you want to be on broadway or in hollywood and you're a christian or you love america or you want to put your flag out i mean these basic things um they will persecute you they will harm you and the thing about good and decent people is they tend to be quiet because they tend to be tolerant and what they need to understand is it's good to be tolerant that's a virtue but it's not a virtue when it turns into the destruction of what is good well i want to thank everybody i will not forget what i heard today it uh it's very moving it's a very tough situation and we've made a lot of progress as you probably have seen and you know and i have a feeling you won't be disappointed i've watched him in just about every situation circumstance from fundraisers to dinners to on the golf course to with family to casual time you begin to know the character of a person you begin to know the patterns of a person he's got an inner strength and an inner core and he's got a love for this country and a love for people i had a guy say to me today it was great he was like yeah god what trump's doing is amazing that guy he is made of steel his backbone is amazing i just wish he could be a little more polite and i was like when they're ripping apart your country and trying to turn it into a communist nightmare you're probably gonna be in a little bit of a bad mood probably gonna fight hard and maybe a little bit dirty you know uh when they're ripping down everything that this country stands for i'm glad we have a president that's kicking dirt back in their face i sincerely believe that when history looks back on this president the story will be told that no one no president has done more for more people and for our country than this one has right now at this time wow we're not going to get anything out here don't get me wrong obviously i chose to participate and i love and appreciate what you guys are doing but are we going to convince anyone differently it's like we're in such a strange time right now yeah that are people open to hearing the real story and i hope they are you know and but i say all the time i'm like if people knew him the way i feel like i know him we wouldn't even have to be working so hard to tell this story when the president finally arrived he mentioned he didn't have a lot of time you could tell something was definitely on his mind despite this i watched him pull himself into the moment he gave us his attention as if we were the only people in the room go to the night of the election it's like 2 30 or so in the morning the moment came when you went from trying to win an election and then you won and realized you became the president of the united states if you just share that moment i know laura was there for that moment also so the night of the election was certainly we have to say one of the most exciting times for everybody because nobody's ever seen worldwide i have friends that said they've never seen anything like it i know that some of the big sports networks said it was the most exciting evening they've ever seen so you've had super bowls and you've had some of the biggest events ever and this was probably the most exciting and that was a special night you have the family around and all of a sudden they announced it was two o'clock in the morning or so although i think we knew the result long before that they didn't want to call it they just refused to call pennsylvania they should have called pennsylvania long before but uh we knew that it was uh pretty much over at about ten o'clock but all of a sudden it's two o'clock and we're realizing what happened and being with the family was just something very special because it's such an important thing and and i'm not even saying important for us because i don't think any of us view it that way it's important for our country the country needs help it's needed help for a long time and when you see what's going on now i think maybe even more so in a sense it was it was fomenting and uh it was it was very bad the ideology the the others ideology but now it's all come out they're saying this is really what we want and it's really a sick ideology it's very dangerous and and very bad you look at venezuela you look at cuba you look at so many other places where they have something very similar and what's happened is we've made such great strides but we have to really get this additional four years or the first four years won't mean quite as much and maybe won't mean much at all frankly so we have to get this this next four years it's got a seed just like a tree you can't just put it there and let it grow it has to seed and i think it will have tremendous spirit tremendous spirit we've made a lot of progress other than the plague coming in from china we had the greatest numbers in the history of our country and now we're building them back again and i think next year we're going to be stronger than ever before that's what's happening those are the numbers those are very good at numbers those are the numbers that are coming in we're going to have a year next year that's even better than last year and last year was the greatest year this country's ever had economically family is so important to yourself it's been really a privilege for us to spend time with your family and it seems like with all the other chaos in there in the country in the world right now why is family so important to you so having family and having people that you can really love and trust and all of the things that go along with the word family is very important it grounds you it makes you realize a lot of things that you wouldn't realize otherwise when you see children growing up without a good family structure you see the result is is percentage-wise just a tiny percentage of what it would be if you had the family structure so having family around is number one it makes a nice life it makes a much more comfortable life in so many ways but it's really very important oftentimes the media presents uh you as somebody that doesn't support women yet that couldn't be further from the truth even from the days when you built trump tower you've always put people in places not based on what they look like but based on their performance and based on what they bring to the table and i think it's incredible that you have within your campaign over 50 women that you have so many strong women around you in the administration so i've always felt a great affection and respect for women and it's always been there from day one i don't know i guess you can develop that maybe you can't but with me it was always there and whether it was in business or politics or anything else women have played a very very big role uh the level of genius is unbelievable frankly and it's been an honor to have so many uh winners because they're real winners winners with me i couldn't have won without women but they helped me get there they helped me get there and they're really just i love working with women i love working with women i really appreciate your time sir it means a lot to us so i have to get a because of change i knew it okay what i'm personally fighting for is a future where my kids get to grow up in the same america that i did i think back to my childhood and it's just the greatest memories in the world i remember being so proud to be an american i remember standing up a little taller and prouder with my hand over my heart when i said the pledge of allegiance because i loved this country and i knew how fortunate i was to grow up in this country when i think about my children growing up i want to know that they feel that way too that they get to live in this great country where there are boundless opportunities where there are freedoms unlike any other country in the world nowhere in the entire world in the history of the world has there ever been a country like america where anyone can succeed one of the most essential fundamental elements of our society the freedom to live the life that you want to live you might live a very different life than i live you might think differently than i do but america is big enough to take it this is the country that i would leave behind for my my children and my grandchildren i only wish that america could know and see and understand and truly adore this president the way i and so many others on his staff do people are never going to see his heart because if they did i think the media is just not going to let that happen in this country which is really unfortunate but at the heart of it he's such a good man and he really cares about this country people really thought about that about how he gave up what anybody would consider an incredibly successful life and career to be treated the way he is treated every day they might actually get a little glimpse into what the heart of donald trump actually looks like i think as a country we're fighting to maintain the america we've always known because in many respects there are people out there that want to fundamentally change this country they want to transform it they want us to have a country that would put socialism forward and have more government involved in your life controlling most things that you do and that's a really scary prospect under those circumstances we couldn't thrive in america like we always have people wouldn't have their chance at the american dream so we will be fighting every single step of the way because really nothing is more important good evening america i'm lara trump daughter of bob and linda unesco sister to kyle mother to luke and carolina and the daughter-in-law of our 45th president so you
