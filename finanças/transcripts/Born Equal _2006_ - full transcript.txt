Come on, please, I'm just standing here waiting with Dani, and... And I don't know what to do. Please, please, for God's sake. Okay. What brings you to this house of happiness then, mate? I'm looking for somebody. Looking for someone, yeah? -Who? -Just an old pal, yeah? Right. You just out the nick? Something like that. You are though, ain't you? Aye. We bought you a present, the baby and I. Oh. Fucking hell. Supposed to go for walks together. You don't look very pleased. No, it's... (CLEARING THROAT) What I've always wanted. This came to the door, what do you think? Looks very nice. LAURA: I thought we could go and look at it together. (CLEARING THROAT) You've seen where this is? Yes, why? This is Holland Park, five bedrooms. What, we can afford it. You've just been given a massive bonus. You haven't asked the price, have you? I'm gonna talk to them tomorrow. LAURA: It's only an idea. Do you feel cramped in here, do you? LAURA: No. See you out there. Can you have a shower? You stink of smoke. (KEYS JANGLING) Sweetie, hop in there. -Good morning. -Good morning. -How are you? -I'm good, how are you doing? Really well, you guys, say good morning to Itshe, please? -Good morning. -KIDS: Good morning, Itshe. Ahh... (CHUCKLING) -We're running late, as usual. -Oh, gosh. Um, there's a guy coming at about 11:00 with a marble polisher just to do the entryway. Would you just let him in for me? -Of course, of course. -I'll see you later. -Have a good day. -All right, you too. Bye-bye. I just need to know about your housing history. How'd you come to be here and... -(ROBERT CLEARS THROAT) -Where'd you stay before and... Uh, I've been in jail for the past, uh, six years. What you get done for? What are you asking me this for anyway? What's this got to do with housing? Was there any violence involved? I... But no, no. I didn't know what I was doing, you know. Why are you asking me all this? You know, I mean, what's this going to prove to anybody? Whether I'm... I've got a history of drugs or whatever. What does that mean, my home, looking for, who's here, who goes? I had to... I had to leave my husband because he was, uh, he's... He was... He was very violent so, um... What made you decide to leave now? 'Cause it's a good thing. -Yeah. -It's a really good thing. Well, he, um... He threatened to hurt Danielle. So I couldn't... Obviously, I couldn't let that happen. And your husband doesn't know you're here. No, he doesn't know where we are. Great, that's... That's... That's the number one thing. That's the most important thing. 'Cause, while you're here and he doesn't know that you're here, you're safe. Okay, thank you. It's not the best... I wish I would say, it's the best accommodation and stuff like that, but it's what we have. And it's better than the streets. And it's a roof over your heads. -Yeah. -One question I do wanna ask is that, um, when you go in to have your baby, um, do you know who's gonna be looking after your daughter? Because, um, if you was to stay overnight... I never thought about it, to be honest, I never thought. Mmm-hmm. I don't know anyone. Mmm-hmm. What's your name? -My name is Adanna. -Mine is Danielle. Where do you live? Well, I live downstairs. I live upstairs. Why did you come here? Um... 'Cause my dad was angry, and we didn't like when he was angry. That's enough, darling. You have some breakfast now. MAN: Spare some change, please? MAN: Oh, fucking hell. Not the face. Just... Go on. There's a hundred quid here. Yeah. I'm not gonna fuck you. (CHUCKLES) No. MARK: No, I just had had a bad day, you know... Actually, no, I hadn't had a... I'd had a good day, actually. Guilty conscience. Yeah. You gonna sleep here tonight? Yeah, do you want a smoke? Uh, no, I can't, I've got to, uh... Trying to give up? Well, I... I don't smoke. -Oh, right. -But thanks. And, uh, you take care anyway. I'll see you, good luck. Best 100 quid you ever spent, now, wasn't it? See ya! LAURA: What about Edie? MARK: Sorry? Edie Armitage. Yeah. Ow, feel this. Feel it. He just kicked me. I went to see another house today. I thought you were right, the, um, the one I showed you yesterday in the estate agent's magazine. Well, we don't need a swimming pool, do we? Anyway, it's probably stupid with the baby. It's not very safe. So, um, I rang up the estate agent and asked if they've got a house with a big garden, four bedrooms. And they had one in Richmond that I went to see today. Do you want to know about it? Yeah, yeah, what was it like? Well, it's on this really pretty street, and, um, it's got gates so there's off-street parking. You walk straight into this big hallway which goes into a sitting room which overlooks this huge garden with roses and wisteria and it was... What are you thinking? I wasn't... I wasn't thinking really. Kiss me then. We're in the middle of Old Bond Street. It's not that bad, kissing your wife. No, properly. CHARLIE: Hello, 'Chelle, it's me. When you get this message, phone me back, okay? I don't wanna be waiting for you to phone me. Just phone me straight back. Let me speak to Danielle 'cause you ain't gonna like it if I have to come looking for you. If I find you and I ain't spoke to you, darling, you're in big, fucking trouble, all right? So just pick up the phone and phone me straight back the second you get this message. You can't just walk away, right? So pick up the fucking... (MOBILE BEEPS OFF) Are you okay? DANIELLE: Just a little bit tired. Yeah. DANIELLE: Are we going to be all right? Yeah. What were the phone messages about? -It was just Daddy. -What did Daddy say? He just said he hopes we're all right. And that... We're looking after each other. Does he know where we are? No, he doesn't know where we are. Heya. Lovely day. Thanks. Adanna, listen, you just stay out there. I'm talking to your grandfather. Please. Daddy, sorry, no. YEMI: Daddy, please, I think we have to bring you to London, even if it's just for a little... Just for a little while till everything dies down. We can get money for visa. We can... We can... We can find where Itshe is working. I am... I am working, we can... We can try and find the money because... (VOICE REPLYING) Daddy, I'm running out of credit. The phone is telling me I've only got 30 seconds. I'm going to phone you tomorrow, okay? Daddy? (HORN HONKING) -ADANNA: Daddy? -Adanna, listen. Adanna, I said, be quiet. I had to talk to your grandfather. When I say, "Be quiet", you have to be quiet. ADANNA: So what was the bad news? YEMI: Uh, there's... There's no bad news. ADANNA: Of course there is. YEMI: What is this? ADANNA: One pound. YEMI: How many ice cream can that buy? ADANNA: One. YEMI: I'll race you to the ice cream stand. ADANNA: Hey, Daddy! (YEMI LAUGHING) (DISTANT SIREN WAILING) Excuse me? MARK: Excuse me? -What? -Do you know the... The guy that was here a couple of days ago? He used to... He was here quite regularly, I think. Oh, yeah. Why? What'd you want? Well, I was just looking for him, I just, um... I just have to speak to him. No chance of that, mate, he's gone. Where's he gone? He got battered to fuck the other night. A big gang of lads. MAN: Why, did you know him, right? No, not really. MAN: Did he owe you money? No. MARK: How old are you? 23. Why do you have to sleep here? Where are your family? I ain't got no family. MARK: You've got no brothers and sisters, no parents, no? Oh, yeah, I've got a bloke who, like, shagged my mom and gave her a baby, like, but... MAN: Don't make him parents, does it? Look, um... MARK: Go and find somewhere to stay, please. Cheers, mate. I'd like to make a donation, please. MAN: No problem at all. And how much would you like to donate? Um, uh, I'll make it 20. 20 pounds, sir? -20, 20,000 pounds. -20,000 pounds? Have you given this some significant thought, Mr Armitage? It's quite a sum of money. -Yeah, no, I... -We'll send you a letter in the post, Mr Armitage, thanking you for your donation. Okay. And the card number, please? It's 5-4-5-1... Mom, why... What is this called? It's called a launderette. Why does it wash clothes only? This is where people come to do their washing. What are we going to do when we get a new house? We're gonna live there, what do you think we're gonna do? (DANIELLE SIGHING) I'm getting bored. I'm getting bored of your questions. Silly questions you keep asking me. What is this called? I told you what it's called, it's called a launderette. It's where people come to do their washing. Why do they wash clothes? Why are you pretending to be silly? You're not a silly, little girl, are you? Stop pretending to be. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to snap. ROBERT: Excuse me. Do you need a hand? -Oh, no, thanks... -Oh, sure. -Let me take it, please. -No, really, it's all right. No, look, that's not right. Come on, let, I... We're going the same way. -Oh, all right. -Cheers. Robert, by the way. Oh, I'm Michelle. Nice to meet you, Michelle. Danielle, and this is Henry. Danielle, and this is Henry?

You don't have to take those bags all the way. Oh, no, I'm going up there anyway now. After you. MICHELLE: Thanks very much, it's... Very kind of you. It's a pleasure. You helped me out there, thanks very much. Fancy a wee cup of coffee? Oh, no, thanks, I've got my tea now. -So I'm fine. -Forgot the milk. I don't mean to be funny, it's just, we're not gonna be around so... I've just got to sorting myself out. I didn't mean offence, I didn't mean to offend you, -I'm just... -That's all right. But thanks very much. Thanks for this. That was really helpful, thank you. -Bye-bye. -Bye. DANIELLE: Who was that man? Ahh, he's somebody else who's staying here. I don't really know who he is. DANIELLE: Why did he help us? I don't know, just being nice, I suppose. Tryin' to be nice. Yemi? What are you doing out here? Babinos, I spoke to Babinos. -Oh, God. -No, it's fine. -Be good for your mommy. -What did he say? -It's okay, I will see... -Just tell me what he said. -I will see you later. -Two minutes, Yemi. Let us talk about it later. I have to go to work. Okay, so... ADANNA: Mommy. -You went to the park? -Yeah. Uh, in my next work, I need, uh, to speak very well English because I gonna do a lot MC. A lot of what? MC, the micro... Because I gonna speak in front of public. I am DJ, I am Latin DJ. And you, why you come to London? That is a long story. Um, I'm a... I'm a journalist. Oh, yes? In Nigeria, yes. I write for a paper, and, uh... I wrote... I wrote an article about... About a government, a government in the north of Nigeria. And a militia group... They did not like my article, and so they decided to threaten my family. But, uh... They are now... Threatening to hurt my... My father. They threw a petrol bomb at his car today. (MUTTERING) (MUTTERING) No. I'm sorry, can... Can I have a wee talk with you? Now? If you don't mind, just... Couple minutes. All right, just one minute. Okay. I think you've got me wrong. I wasn't trying to chat you up. You're pregnant and all that, and your bags and stuff and I just thought... She needs a bit of help. And that was all it was. I'm no... Just 'cause I'm in here, right, it doesn't really say I'm a scumbag, you know what I mean? I would never think you were... I don't know you. I know that, but I'm just... I just didn't want you to get the wrong impression, you know what I mean? I was just looking out for my little girl. I know that, I know that. If you need anything at all, I'm just here. -Thank you. -It's a pleasure. It's just, I mean, you don't know who you can trust, you know? Totally, totally, absolutely. You want coffee sometime then? Yeah, maybe. -All right. -Thank you, good night. All the best. (DISTANT SIREN BLARING) Hi, are you Mark? -Yes, hello, Sally. -Sally, from Accommodate. -Hi, nice to meet you. -How do you do? Good, thanks. You? Yeah, good, do you want to get a coffee? Yes. It's basically, uh, finding new people sleeping rough. Or others that are already there. And just helping them to, you know, get them into accommodation. What's kind of drawn you to do that? What did you... Um... (CHUCKLING) Actually, I really don't know, um... You know, I've... I've got what I need and life is pretty good for me. You know, and, um... People who... I will pass people who've got less than nothing, and, uh, there's something wrong with that. And, uh, for a while you... You can behave as if that's not important and they're... I don't know, I don't know why it's now, I don't know. -Pink ones? -ROBERT: Roses? MAN: Roses, good for your girlfriend. ROBERT: Love it. -12 pounds, mate. -What? 12 pounds. 10 roses. MAN: It's a good offer. ROBERT: Is it because roses are so expensive? MAN: No, they're not really, no. MAN: Both are going about 15 quid a time, yeah? -I'll do... Try me best. -Thanks, mate. -Take that one. -Great, it's not bad. That'll do. -Thanks very much. -Cheers.

DANIELLE: We haven't got a vase. We'll have to put them in something. There is water in the sink. Yeah, put them in the sink. DANIELLE: I go run the tap so we can put them in the tap. Yeah, go on. MICHELLE: Go on. MICHELLE: He gave you one too. -Big bunch of flowers. -Why did he give them to us? I don't know. Maybe he thought it was our birthday. Maybe he did. We never got flowers before, did we? MICHELLE: Just for us? Never had any flowers. If not initially, they do want the help, you know, I mean... Right. If you wake them up, they might be pissed off... Yeah, sure, yeah. Tread carefully, but... -You know these two? -No. Spare a bit of change, please? Can't spare any change, I'm afraid. But, um... My name is Sally and I'm from Accommodate. -This is Mark. -Hi. He's helping me out tonight. We're looking to help people like you two. Trying to help get you some accommodation, if... If you can get us somewhere together. Where we can be together, then, yeah, we'd be interested, I don't wanna be separated. It took me long enough to find him. I've lost a lot through the drinking. I mean, I've got... I've got four children. I've lost them through the drinking. I'm not gonna move into a hostel and end up losing him. -SALLY: No. -How old are your kids? The youngest one is 16, and the oldest one is 26. And they're not in a position to help you at all? -No. -No. WOMAN: I was supposed to look after them, not them supposed to look after me, basically.

They knew you're here? I can't tell my mom. Why's that? That's why I'm here, her boyfriend hits us. Her boyfriend? He needs someone to take out, doesn't he? I don't believe you have to be here. I've got nothing better, how would you know? Well, you're 17, come on. You know, I mean, I haven't got any answers for you. I don't... I don't... I don't know what to say to you. But I just know nobody has to be in a place like this. Nobody has to sleep in a tunnel. It's better than some things. Yeah. (SNIFFLING) Look, I can't, I've gotta... I know this isn't gonna... I don't want your money. I know you don't want it, just take it. Here, come on, you don't have to give it back. No, please don't, come on, please. That's all anybody does, is go!

I'm looking for somebody, actually, I'm looking for a woman. Uh, Gellen, Margaret Gellen? Do you know her? Sorry, you are? I'm looking for her. (CHUCKLING) Okay, well, I'll tell you what you need to do. You need to contact reception and get them to enter it into the personnel department. And they might be able to help you? Oh, no, I'm not looking for any details. I just want to know if she works here or not. You know her, don't you? I can tell you know her. My name's Robert. Mean anything? Aye. She doesn't work here any more. -She don't? -No. -Sure? -I'm sure. Listen, you may have heard a lot of bad stuff about me, but I'm not here to cause any trouble. I just want to know where she is. I don't know that I know where she is. It's been a long time since I saw her. She left here quite a while ago. How long? (SCOFFS) Six years, more? Look, the last time I heard she was gonna go work in a hotel is what I heard. But whether she's still there, I don't know. Do you know which one? Yeah, it was the Grosvenor House Hotel. -Grosvenor? -Grosvenor House. She might not be there any more. She may be, though. (TRAIN WHEELS SCREECHING) CHARLIE: Hello, 'Chelle, it's me.

That's all I wanna do, is just talk to you for one minute. I can't handle this. I need you. Love you forever, babe. I love you and Danielle forever. Whatever happens. Please, just phone me back. ROBERT: Who is it? It's Michelle. There you are. Hello. Come on in. -Come on. -Thank you. He always says he's sorry, you know, it's really difficult 'cause... Says he's sorry for what? For beating you up? You probably think I'm really stupid, don't you? No, I don't think you're stupid at all. It's difficult 'cause it's her dad, you know? Don't know if she should see him again, or... Does she wanna see him again, does she mention him? She don't really talk about him much. He really wasn't a good dad. Did you like your dad? That's a long story. Oh, no. (CHUCKLING) No, I loved my dad, I did. And my mother threw him... Threw him out when I was about 12. And um... (CLEARING THROAT) I hated her for it, you know? 'Cause my dad was, um... Took me to football you know, sports and the like. And, he was a hero, you know? And, uh... Anyway, he died when I was 16, and, um... I went nuts. Eventually, my ma told me that he was a drunk. He was a womaniser. He was... Knocking about. Michelle, I've been in jail, right. Twice. You haven't killed anybody, have you? No. Phew. (LAUGHING) No, it's all... Everything was taking money. And it was really the second time that I was in that, um... I began, you know, to see it all. And you recognise guys in there just like my da. They were just like me. You know what I mean? And I've seen it all. How sorry I was, you know, I treated my ma. Anyway, I used to write to her and, uh... And, uh, and... She never wrote back. You got any pictures of her? I lost all the pictures of mine. I'm never getting them back now, so... MICHELLE: Oh, wow, I love black and white pictures. MICHELLE: She looks so glamorous, didn't she? We all just need someone to look out for us, don't we? Aye. Oh, see, you're all right. You don't know me. So do you fancy fish and chips? All right. I think you're mom's gonna be sick with worry, you know? She probably is. You say you have brothers and sisters? I've got a little sister. How old is she? Seven. And this guy, boyfriend of your mom, does he hit her, as well? He does? Me and my mom were talking. And he came in, he was just mad. He started like flipping things over and... He started to hit my mom and because I told him to get off, he started hitting me. And the more she tries to help, the more he hits her. He's sick. He said as well that they're gonna take me and my sister off my mom. She can't help it. She can't stop him doing what he does. I can't ever, ever remember a time when we were all being able to just like... Sit down and watch TV without... Without arguments or an uproar happening. Sorry. Why are you interested in knowing all this? Well, I know you now. I've never been able to tell anybody about anything. Don't even talk to my mom about it. Am I gonna get to see you again? Yes, of course. -Sure? -Yes. SALLY: You have to be very careful. MARK: Don't get too involved. No, I understand that, I just, you know... It was very difficult to get any trust, to build any trust. I know and you feel very sort of special, but it's just... You gotta have a boundary. Right. I don't think it's got to that point, you know? I think she's, um... You know, I just, as I said, I wouldn't... I wouldn't wanna... I wouldn't wanna feel I was letting her down at this point. MARK: But, uh, no, it's done. YEMI: We're going to try and get some money together for a visa, huh? FATHER: Well, you know, they are 5,000 pounds. For what, 5,000... 5,000 pounds for what? Depends on who that they say coming in, to get the visa is 5,000 pounds. 5... 5,000 pounds. And I don't have that money. Yes, I don't have that money, you don't have that money, too. How do we go about it? "'I like this game, it's fun,' he said." All right, come on, then. Night, night. Sleep tight. Don't let the bed bugs... Don't... -Bite. -Bite. -ROBERT: Who is it? -Oh, it's me, Michelle. Listen, do you wanna go and annoy somebody else? Oh, yeah, you love it. -How are you? -All right. She's fast asleep, you know, so... -Come on in. -Thank you. You looking forward to it? Yeah. Yeah, can't wait now. A miracle, yeah. It's an absolute miracle. Do you mind if... If I touch you? MICHELLE: No. ROBERT: Wow. Can you believe there's a life in there. You should have kids, you'd be a good dad. MICHELLE: You're great with Danielle. Think so? MICHELLE: She loves you. I like you. I like you, too. I'm about scared. Me too. I haven't kissed anybody in a long time. (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) ROBERT: All the money in here, unbelievable. MICHELLE: I know. MICHELLE: Do you imagine the size of the gardens? MICHELLE: Be like having your own park. I bet half of them don't even know what they've got, you know? Yeah, probably got country houses and don't live here all the time. I've had enough of all these people... Credit card and, you know... I mean, look at this, look at that. Look at that, do you see gate, do you know what that is? That's a big X, break in here. -Oh, no. -I'm telling you. I wouldn't mess with them anyway, most of them. I don't want any of their stuff. Don't want what they've got. I know, I don't want this to sound like... (MUTTERING) I want better stuff, you know? Wee better stuff. Yeah. I just don't like people when they display it, you know what I mean, when it's like pushed down your throat? That's when it gets annoying, I think. Yeah, but we're all under the same sky. Aye. That's, uh, really... That's quite romantic now actually. Well, I'm very romantic. (LAUGHING) We're all under the same sky, you know, it's the same for everybody. Yeah. MICHELLE: Poor old Henry. I think he's ready for bed. (DANIELLE GIGGLES) So why you doing all this, then? What? Looking after me and bringing me here and... I don't do things like this. This isn't like something. It's just the way of getting out of a kind of loop that I got myself into. And I think it's entirely my fault, you know? What with? You know, I've got everything I want, really. My wife is just lovely. I just looked around at everything I had and it just seemed emptier and emptier, really. And that's not the sort of thoughts you can share with your friends, at least not where I come from. So what about your big house and your wife? You know, when I met you and you said you didn't have anybody. You know, you might as well not have a mom, you know... There was nobody. You know, in so many ways, we couldn't be more different you and me, but in that way, I think we're not that different. I know there's so many people at work. I go to work, I go to parties, I go to the club. I don't know, I feel like I don't know anyone. Yeah, but isn't that what everybody wants? A house, a partner. Yeah, but I come through the door, and everything's right. And, um... I'm lonelier than ever, really. Now, that's not, you know, that's not a sob story. I'm not complaining about my life. It's just that's how it is, you know? And maybe that's why I'm doing this, I... Well, I might not be a wife, and I might not have a big house, but I'll be there if you need me. I know it's not a lot but... Hmm. You all right? Yeah. You're a wonderful girl. Thank you. Aren't you gonna stay here? No, I can't. -You sure? -Yeah. I can't, I can't do... LAURA: Where have you been? I've just been working. But, Mark, it's 12:00. You can't still be working. LAURA: Are you having an affair? I was just waiting for that. MARK: I was really hoping you wouldn't ask that question. I'm asking it, are you having an affair? No, I'm not. MARK: I've got involved in other strands of work. I can't talk to you about at the moment. What do you mean? I just got involved... It's nothing bad, please. What happens if I go into labour? I can't get you on the phone. You never leave it on. LAURA: How do I tell you that your child is on the way? What's the right answer, Laura? There isn't a right answer? I just wish you wanted to be here. Pray with me, pray with me, pray with me. Heavenly Father. I thank you for Itshe, I thank you for Adanna. I pray that you will protect them as I go back to Nigeria. Father, don't... That you will look after them for me. Father God, I have to go back, Itshe, you know I have to to back. Father God, look after my family. -Listen to me. -Shh! They'll kill you, do you understand? -They won't kill me, Itshe. -If you go back to Nigeria... Why don't you just pray with me, Itshe? You will not go back, because I won't pray to God to kill you. Are you crazy? What are you talking about? Please. -Hello. -Hello. How are you? Oh, fine, thank you, how are you? Oh, very well. Whoo, my goodness, it is so hot out there today. (ITSHE CHUCKLING) (SIGHING) -You doing all right? -Fine, thank you. Oh, Itshe, what is it? I'm so sorry, I shouldn't be bothering you with this. Oh, no, that's all right. (SIGHS) We just had some bad news from home. We're just trying to get my father-in-law over and it's not going to be possible. Why not, what's happened? We need to raise 5,000 pounds for a visa. 5,000 pounds is ridiculous. Have you talked to the embassy about that? Oh, we've done all that we can, it's just, we have to keep working hard and hoping and praying. Oh, my goodness, you poor baby. It will be fine. If you wanna come and talk to me this week, I'm around all the rest of the week, okay? Thank you. I just gotta go and get ready for this silly dinner. Of course, of course, you must go. Sorry. All right. Mom, do you really like Robert? Yeah, he's a nice man. Do you like him? You like him more than Daddy? That's a silly question. I like them in different ways. How'd you like them in different ways? Well... Robert makes us laugh, doesn't he? And Daddy doesn't. Not really. He's not really very funny, is he? -Does Henry like Robert? -Well, I better ask. Henry? Can you tell me your opinion on Robert? Oh, yeah. He thinks he's quite nice. Can I hold him? Henry. What was that, Henry? Henry said do you want to marry Robert? What do you mean, do I want to marry him? Don't know. Henry just said that. Henry's a nosey parker, isn't he? (GIGGLING) Sticking his nose in. He'd like to... Tumble dryers. That one up there has literally go around to the top. The have eyes nearly up to the top. (STAMMERING) She kissed me. I know. Well... You're gonna have to go... You're gonna have to not see her any more. What, just not go back? No, you're gonna have to go and see her, explain the situation, and then cut off all contact from her. You are dealing with a girl. Listen, I know, I don't wanna make excuses, but I didn't see it coming. I know you warned me. But she is a child, you know? So it's gonna be hard for me, as well, to, I mean, not hard to... It's gonna be hard for me to walk away from her, and I'm very fond of her. I wish I hadn't known. Mommy! Mommy, Mommy, Mommy. -Hello, baby. -I'll see you later. Yemi, Yemi, Yemi, I have to talk to you. Two minutes, I have to talk to you, it's very, very urgent, please, please, please, please. Come inside with me. Baby, I need you to wait for me here for two minutes, that's okay. -Okay. -Come in. Itshe, I'm going to be late for work. I have some good news. Your father is going to be okay. We can get the visa, he's going to be fine. What... What... What are you talking about? Oh, I'm shaking, you don't have to go to Nigeria. It's going to be fine. -But why? -I have the money. -Praise God. -Take the money. Praise God. You have to take the money now. You have to get your father over now. He's going to be okay. Itshe, who gave you the money? Yemi, just take the money, just take it to your father. Itshe, where did you get the money? Yemi... Itshe, where did you get the money? Yemi, didn't you hear me, listen. When I was working today, I kept asking God for an answer. This is the answer, Yemi. I took the money, Yemi. They will not know. -Itshe. -They will not know. -It's just lying there. -Itshe, you have killed us. -You do not hear me. -Itshe, you have... -Yemi, if you don't take... -Itshe, you have killed us! -If you don't... -Itshe, what have you done? Keep your voice down. If you don't take this money now, -what is going to happen to us? -Itshe, Itshe... If you don't take this money now. You are going to take that money back right now! You think I had a choice? You think I had a choice? ZOE: Hello. -How are you? -I'm all right. -Okay? -Mm-hmm. Finally getting some chips down you. About time, isn't it? ZOE: Want some? My life is extremely complicated, Zoe. I can't... I can't mislead you. But you're not. You're not understanding me, are you? Yeah, you've told me about your family. You've told me everything you do. I don't think I can see you any more. I think it's... I think it's the... I think it's the only way I can help you. But, you know I love you, Mark, so why can you do that to me? What? Well, you knew that? -Zoe... -But you do. Zoe, you don't even know if you like me. How can you tell me I don't know if I like you? We've known each other for about three or four days. I'm a 45-year-old man who's about to have a child. Yeah, but that doesn't matter. Hang on, 45, 17, married man, baby. Isn't there some part of that that sort of strikes you as difficult? No. -Have you been speaking to her? -No. She's fucking jealous that you're with me, that's what it is, stupid bitch. No, she doesn't know it's got this far. Don't know how what's got what far? Look, I wanna help you. No, don't give me... If that's money, you better take it away. I'm not even fucking joking. I'm not happy to be giving you money, Zoe. Move the fucking money! You'll not try and walk out on me, Mark! You know what? Not a fucking person that will stand there and look after you. (ZOE SHOUTING) MARK: Settle down! Jesus Christ! What are you, fucking psycho, woman? I tried to help you! What the fuck am I supposed to do? Now just fucking back off! Fuck off. ZOE: You don't fuck off! MARK: Get away. Get away. (ZOE CRYING) (CRYING CONTINUES) I'm not having an affair. I swear, I'm not. What have you done? I just got lost, I got scared. I just got a bit scared about... I got this idea in my head about... I don't know, I just didn't... I lost contact with everything. I lost you. I just got completely adrift and I just... I just thought God's got this mission to help people and I... I just, I have to, I've gotta do it, you know? All I saw was... What I saw going to work and coming home from work, and I just saw it and I just... -What are you talking about? -I couldn't deal with it. What are you talking about? I don't know, you know, I'll tell you about it. -I don't understand. -I know. I should've spoken to you and I haven't, have I? I'm so sorry, I've been so cruel to you. Itshe, what are you doing? The drawer was open, I was... Checking that everything was safe. Did you take some money from there? No, I was... I just... I was so scared for my family, I just... I didn't want anything to happen to them. So I took the money and I brought it right back. And all of it is right here. Please, all of the money is here. I didn't take one note, nothing. -It's all here. -You put it back? I'm so sorry. Please. I wish that you just asked me to help you. I didn't know what to do, I... I tried to... I liked having you here so much. I understand. You have to do what you think is right. Hi, excuse me. I was wondering if you could help me. How did you get in? The boy at the desk. -Oh. -Sent me down. -Did he? -Aye. All right. I'm trying to find somebody that maybe worked here. Her name's Gellen Margaret Gellen? And... Why do you wanna know? -Do you know her? -I'm her son. We fell, you know what I mean? Something stupid, you know, stupid. Margaret doesn't work here any more. She's... I've not seen her for about three years. -So you knew her? -Oh, yes, uh-huh. Did she mention me? My name's Robert, did she mention me? Robert, Robert, uh-huh, she did, yeah. Right, so all that's in the past, you understand me? Right. Well, I mean, that don't have... Nothing to do with me. No, but you might know why she won't see me -and I'm getting that vibe. -No, no. Look, maybe she doesn't even want to see me, -but I wanna fucking see her. -Uh-huh. Right, it's that fucking important. Because my whole life is on this. If you know where she is, fucking tell me. And we're gonna have a little chat in here. Yeah. And... Um... She doesn't wanna see me, does she? Uh, no, no, no, no, it's not that, it's not that, um... What, what is it? Oh, I don't know how to say, I mean... Well, she, she died, um, about two years ago. Um... What are you telling me? Well, that's... That's what I'm telling you. She died of cancer, lung cancer. You all right? Thanks. (KNOCKING) (KNOCKING) Did I wake you up? -No. -You all right? You look like you've been asleep? Are you not feeling well? (WHISPERS) I've got nothing. I've got nothing. If I can't have anything, I'm not really here. I'll never have... A house. And I'll never have... A family. I want a family. I want respect. I'm fed up being treated like a fucking scumbag every time I fucking go outside. Every shop against you. I'm dodgy. Every fucking office I got into, I'm fucking dodgy. MICHELLE: What do they know? They don't know you. I know you and I respect you. You should go. Why are you here? MICHELLE: Just pop around, maybe go get a coffee. No, why are you here? ROBERT: You don't need to be here. Because I haven't got anywhere else to go. -Go back. -I can't go back. Go back. -I can't go back. -Just get out of here, take your wee child and just go back. I can't go back, if I take her back there, I don't know what he'll do to her. My darling. (CRYING) -I'm not going anywhere. -I don't like this. Please! Just go! I don't wanna go, I can't go, where will I... Fucking go! You can't fucking help me! Help your fucking self! Help your wee girl! Go fucking back, I don't want you! -You don't mean that. -You understand that? I don't fucking want you, don't fucking mean it! I don't fucking want you here! (CRYING) All right, all right, okay. I'm gonna go. (SOBBING) (CRYING) (YEMI CRYING) YEMI: Why did you take him away from me? Why? I begged you. I prayed to you. I pleaded. I pleaded with you. He spent his... He spent his whole life loving you. Working for you. Teaching others about you. I hate you, I hate you, I hate you. I hate you, I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I dreamt about the baby last night. LAURA: Did you? Well, he wasn't a baby, he was about five. We were playing in the garden. We had two little girls, as well. Do you know where it was? It was that Richmond house. You know, the one with the wisteria? A beautiful garden. There's an ivory wall at the end. Apple tree. It was so... This is all I want, really. I thought this is the... This is the place I was quibbling about the price. (CHUCKLING) I can't put a price on it. I really love you. It's gonna be good. I got back in the nick of time. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Who is it? I thank God for you, I thank God for you. Adanna. But, Daddy, where's Babinos? Babinos is in heaven. (CRIES OUT) (GROANS) (GROANING CONTINUES) I think the baby's coming. Oh... (GROANS) (KNOCKING) Robert, it's Michelle. Robert, it's Michelle, it's started. Hello, hi. -NURSE: Hi. -Hi. We're not expecting you, are we? I think it's starting. Okay, all right, all right, let's let this one pass then. -Nice and slow. -Oh. (EXHALES SLOWLY) -(GROANS) -Slowly does it. How often are they coming? About three... Every three minutes. All right. We need to have a look at you and get you sorted, then, don't we? -What's your name, my lovely? -This is Danielle. Danielle, do you want to sit in the big girl's chair for me? Take Mommy's bag, Dani. All right, my lovely, let's have a look at this bump and see what's going on, okay? Just going to listen to the baby, okay? Okay. Hello. My name's Rachel. Hi, how are you? What's this called? -Henry. -Henry. Hi, hi, what's your name? -Michelle, Michelle Ford. -Hi, Michelle. There's nothing to worry about, nothing to worry about. We've just got paged, I'm a duty social worker from the hospital social work team. I know that you might have to stay in here for a few days. So I'm really sorry to ask you this. I've got one question for you. -Yes. -Nothing to worry about. Can you think of anywhere tonight that Danielle might be able to stay? No. There's no friends or family who live around here? No... Her uncle Steven... Okay, don't... Listen, don't worry, don't worry. What we're going to do is we've got some lovely foster parents who live really near here, okay? And they're on emergency call. So I've already made a few phone calls. But we'll do is, we'll make sure, we'll bring Danielle tomorrow, she can come and see you, but I think it's best 'cause it's really late now. Danielle, do you want to stay with me? We'll come back to my office, you can bring doggie. -What was doggie called again? -Henry. And you'll come and see Mommy tomorrow, is that okay? Yeah? And you'll come and see Mommy and maybe a new brother or sister, okay? -All right, Michelle? -I'll see you tomorrow, I promise. I love you, I love you. It's okay. Ready for this now. That's okay. Don't you worry, don't worry. Don't worry, don't worry. Mommy! Mommy! (SOBBING) Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! (HORN CHIRPS) -(TIRES SCREECHING) -Whoa! (HORN HONKS) Fucking wanker. What's a matter with you, you cunt? ROBERT: You just fucking see me now. Huh? Do you see me now? You fuck, aren't you? Just the three of us... You wanna die? You think your big, fucking fancy car... Big, fucking fancy house... Think you fucking own me? You fucking own me? Any reason a cunt like you ends up with all this, and cunt like me ends up with fuck all? Who's that? No way, man. No fucking way. The last time you've barked at the right fucking guy. (CHUCKLING) By the wrong fucking guy. OFFICER: Robert! Robert! Robert! Robert. (SOBBING) (BABY CRYING) (BABY CRYING)
