What are you doing? Come on, come inside. Julia, leave it... Julia, get over here! No, I won't! Come on, go inside! Mary, Mary... Please, wait... Please. Mary! Please! Wait, please stay. I'm tired, sir. I'm really tired. My name is Mia. I'll try not to be dra-ma-tic. Nice writing! Julia, my dear daughter, I'm slowly preparing my farewell. And if my goodbye doesn't ever reach you... - Come around for some mate, later. - OK, I'll bring some biscuits. - Hi - Hi, Alma. Girls, Let's be quiet. Let Sebastian speak. It was really hard to get that meeting. Really hard. And there's good news. It's likely we'll get a hotel and a subsidy... A what? It's like a salary, some money for each family. No, I've got my house here, my husband. I don't want to go and live all all jammed up in a hotel. I prefer a salary and some God made walls. There is no God, you twit! What's more, I think the salary and the hotel is bullshit. And what do we have here? No gas, water or electricity. This is a squat honey, not an estate. They already killed the dogs. We're next, Antigua. Go to the hotel, if you like. You can all go. I founded this place. I founded it years ago with a lot of effort. So they'll have to drag me out. OK, it's just a proposal. We must avoid an eviction or you'll all be in the street. Do we agree on that? Well, do we? Yes. Well, go talk it over. We'll see how it all works out. There you go again with your gadget. Well, it's the only way to stop police abusing you and buming your houses. It's important to record the way you live here in the village. The village? Yes, the Pink Village. That's what they call it. It sounds better than slum, doesn't it? No. Come on. Help me light the fire. They didn't even leave a mattress this time. Well tonight we'll go find one and you can come live with me. In-di-vi-duals aren't born com-plete. It says, we're not born completely finished, That's what I understood. I think she's right. Listen, I've been practicing: I'm a woman... I'm a mons... Mons-ter. Monster. I'm both. Some hard words... You didn't practice much... I did. I read two pages last night... She's sad... She's crazy... You're crazy. You read. Manuel asks me the same thing every day. Manuel is her husband. Don't you want to get up, today? Don't you want to write your column today? Don't you want me to open the windows, today? Don't you want this, don't you want that? No... no. Be quiet and listen. All the questions start with don't you... What did I say, Pedrito? It's not just once a week, like some faggot, I know. I wonderwhy Manuel threw it out? You think he didn't mean to? Read out loud. There's a date and then it goes on. I looked in the mirror and tried to find a familiar expression imitating my daughter's smile. The girl's smile... But I hate Julia's smile. I hate it, because it's what keeps me awake. I think this crazy chick must be dead. Shut up you drama queen! I mean it... And if she's dead this book is worth a fortune. Do you think so? Find out. They might even give you a reward. Or maybe a job. What kind of a job do you think that Manuel will give you? Just as a maid. Here, read, practice On the other page. I co-llect songs. So-me spe-ak of what I believe in. Here... I'm looking for a song with an answer. How can I leave, without leaving you alone? You can keep the water. I got the batteries. Here they are. Give them here. See you Ale. See you Carlitos. Take care. My voice will break through until the echo of yesterday. Bye Carlitos. Bye. In the end, I'm alone, thirsty and tired of the road. But I keep on growing in the sun Alive. Hi, there. How is everyone? Hi, how are you, Ale? How are you, Coquito? Go get your wages. I'll unload it for you. Thanks. How are you? Cold, in this weather. Got some clothes for your kids. My reason has no pity, She gets ready to leave. I'm not afraid of death to just go to sleep and watch me fade. A story will remember me. I live. Hi. Hi. Is the Mrs. In? Go inside. No. Go inside, Julia. No. Go inside. No. Go inside. No. Go inside! Hello. What do you want here? I'm looking for Mrs. Mia. I found something that's hers and I was returning it. I'm not after any money. Don't! Fucking fag! Go to sleep Julia. I don't want to. Julia, go to sleep. Switch off the light. Read me some more, go on. I'm having a baby, boy or girl... Julia. I bought the magazine "Being a mom". There were babies of all kinds, skinny, plump, smiling... Mothers of all kinds. Why is it so easy for them?" Why does she cry and bite my nipples as if it hated me? Have a rest Pedrito. How does that song go? A dream, I dreamt last night. A dream from, last night a dream from the soul, I dreamt of my loved ones, that I held in my arms. I saw a very white lady enter, I saw a very white lady enter. Whiter than cold snow. How did you get in my love? How did you get in my darling? The doors are all closed, so are the windows and blinds I'm not love, dear lover. I'm death, God sent me. Oh, unforgiving death, let me live another day. You can't have a day. You've only an hour to live. Hello. Keep your voice down, Pedro's sleeping. Come with me tonight, you'll feel much better. Here, try this on. What about me? I picked this out for you. It will look great on you. Where did you get it? From Caritas. Move over. The old woman didn't want to give it to me. She said it was for women. How rude. Yeah. But I said: "It's all uni-sex now, lady". Try this one. I don't need a wig. And what do you know of wigs? It won't button up. Goodness! Doesn't matter. What do I owe you? Buy me some honey sweets and a few bottles of water from Carlitos. Look at her hit the booze. Come on, I'll take the jacket. Bye, slut. What are you laughing at? Remember the horse is 9, and 6 makes 15. You can't fail. What about number 10? I'm going to get my things. Let's keep on playing. Use-less mother seeks some-one to replace her. Should be like a comic heroine. In-vin-ci-ble. Mia is alive? Your daughter should know what she went through. She left her daughter a lot of songs. Did you know that, Mr. Manuel? Did you hear that, Mr. Manuel? Did you hear this? As daylight burns out in the sky I'll be going. I'll leave with my shaking body and a hoarse voice from screaming, I will return. Come here. No, please stay here. Why me, God? Shut up. You fucking fag! Knock it off! Fuck off! Stop shouting. You can shout in the police station, motherfucker! Julia, my child, what if my goodbye never reached you? What remains to be done. To teach you to make the tight braid. To teach you to be kind. To teach you to find me when I'm not there. Do you need some help? It stings. I bumed myself. Go get one of those leaves over there. Go on. Which one? Anyone, anyone. That one, that one's fine. That leaf's too small. Grab a bigger one. That's right. Careful, mind the thorns. Give me your hand. Give me your hand, this will cure it. There we are. Gently. What happened? I tried to make pancakes. How can a big girl like you get burned making pancakes? Can you make them? Sure. They have eggs, milk, flour. Will you teach me? First you beat the eggs. No, inside, in the kitchen. No, I can't. Why? Your dad will get mad. He'll be back tonight. He's not home. I wanted to make pancakes for him. No, I can't. I can't stand people who are afraid. We'll be more comfortable inside. No. Don't be afraid. I said no. I'll just help you prepare the mix. You don't want to get burned again. You'll have to wait for your dad to make them. Is it Ale for Alejandra? It's not a bad name, Alejandra. Ale for Alejandra. Just Ale. Plain Ale. Why did you come? I'm looking for work. This still needs more salt. Why did you ask for my mom? Didn't you know she died? No, I didn't. Does it take long to make pancakes? You have to be a bad cook to take long making pancakes. Teach me to make one. My dad will come home. But he can't cook. He'll get burned like me. No. Why not? I already said no. No. Look what you've done to my face! Don't you dare. Yes, yes. Stop it! You have to put some butter in the frying pan. OK, now what do I do? Now wait for it to heat up, and with a ladle pour a bit of the mix in it. What happened? Make one, and then you can go. Are you paying attention? Yes. Once it's cooked on one side, you flip it overwith this and wait for it to cook, slowly. Tell me more. The grandmother tells the girl where the snow comes from. Do you know where it comes from? From the sky, where else? No, it doesn't come from the sky. It comes from a castle. Aboy called Edward lives there. He's hiding from everyone. His dad was an inventor who died and didn't finish him. And the snow? You'll have to see the movie. And why does he hide from everyone? He has scissors instead of hands. He's scary. He's made of bits of cloth. And that scares you? Some bits of cloth? What a silly girl. Come here, give me your hand. Leave it nice and loose. We're going to do a magic trick. See. Very good. Don't be scared. He's breathing. His name is Manuel. He's my dad. Ale, wait Will I see you again? Raise your arm. That's it, hold it up. A bit more. There we are. My name is Julia. Bye, Julia. Bye. Hurry up. Ale. Keep still a minute. Ready. Shut your mouth. We didn't know we couldn't dress normally, that we had to look pitiful. I don't like that. Ale dressed all of us, one by one. Pedro combed each one differently. What's wrong with that? This is a documentary, Antigua. It's a testimony. We must show things as they are not all dressed and made up. This isn't you. I won't appear in a... ...documentary. In a documentary, dressed in slacks and torn gym shoes. So if you don't like it... The clothes are OK, you look good but not from a slum. The dirty linen is washed at home. What really matters here is what we have to say. Does it matter if I have nailpolish or not? Poor, but clean and sexy. Yeah, that's us. Transvestites love to fantasize. You'd better learn that. If you want to talk about us. OK. Let's roll, the sun's going down. This slum was formed after this priest from Buenos Aires, the Archbishop, said that gays and transvestites had to live on an island and not bother people. Who were the first to arrive? The first to come here were El Pedro and La Pedro, his partner. Unfortunately... La Pedro passed away. Go on Pedro, tell us. I'm Pedro, from Paraguay. I came to Buenos Aires very young. I lived in the street a long time. We used to come with my partner to the river to wash clothes. While we waited for it to dry we'd lie in the sun. He'd say, "what a nice place to build a house." One day we heard shouting in the reeds and walked over. I remember, it was me fighting with my dog Maria Marta. We drank some "mate" and she let us build our house there too. Then, in time, other gays who lived in the street started coming and it was the beginning of this shanty town. Only homosexuals and transvestites? No, no... There was also my husband, Claudia's, Carlitos', and the girl. Who'll make you a grandma any day now. I found her outside the airport. She has 14 years old, she was 3 months pregnant, and almost dead. You're cardboard collectors? Yeah, to make a few pesos. What's a normal day for a cardboard collector like you? Cardboard in the day, sewing in the afternoon and some nights. I can't complain. A wish? Can it be 3? Yes. To have my own shop and for Pedro to have his salon upstairs. To be complete as a human being. I wasn't born complete. And the last one? To be who I want to be. Let the party begin! Come on, let's dance. OK. Give me your glass. That's it. - Well stirred. - Yes. - Cheers for la Pedro. - For la Pedro. The innocence of a girl who wanted to live like a beautiful flower that she saw before her. This 15 year old girl who robbed his heart. He promised to love her forever Come here. And wrapped her in kisses.0 She was madly in love with him. Young girl, young girl, young girl from the slum, you're in love, young girl, you'd give your life for him, only for him. Young girl, young girl young girl from the slum, You know nothing of life. You're not yet a woman. I really like the way you dance. You dance better. I dance "cuarteto", I'm from Cordoba. You'll have to teach me. - Who's your best friend? - You. - Who? - You. Hey, this guy wants to party. No, I don't want to. Come on! Hi, honey. - Are we going to the usual place? - Yeah. Hi, I'm Mia. I want a different heart. Eyes wide open, another color, another shape. I imagine myself falling over a cliff and the sound of my name smashing on the floor. You must go in. We are human beings. For security reasons we can't go in. - Who said so? - The police. The police? You should be on our side. You're a nurse, not a cop, asshole! I'd like to have a strong body, brave and robust. Like a dog from the street, those who know how to love. I went down many times. Once when I discovered I was pregnant. I started to fall, slowly. The second, when Julia was born. This time the silence lasted longer. But not to be able to speak helped me disguise my fear of holding Julia in my arms. I knew you'd be back. Life is more beautiful if you wear surprising clothes. Break the "evening look" mixing an extra big dress and flat sandals. On that note I ended the fashion column where I worked and went to pick up Julia, at school. Of course, Mia was a journalist. And she worked in fashion. Isn't that a coincidence? Why? Because I work in fashion too. Go on reading. When I saw Julia come out of school I imagined her without me and didn't wait for her. Julia shouted at me. You're not my mom! You don't love me! I took her acusation, a child's acusation, very seriously and felt she was right. I didn't love her and she found out. Why live if you want to die? Poor thing. She's a manic depressive from Nu?ez. That's because she didn't live in the street and didn't have much time to mistreat the child. You know what? You're a woman from the mouth outwards. You'll never know how that girl felt. I'm very much a woman. That's why her husband won't leave her. Go on Seba, you were on the best part. I began living without any desire. I started to write, to avoid living. Go on, I'll be late. Bye, dad. Bye. Ale, come here! Come on! No, you come over. Come on. And the maid? I have a plan, come on. Goodness! Hello, is this Nancy? This is Manuel Castillo's sister. Yes. I was calling to say that Julia came here straight from school. Yes... exactly. So you don't have to go to work, understand? Yes, of course. Thank you, yes, yes. Thank you very much. Well. Hope you're well. Goodbye. I don't think she believed me. You were great! No, I wasn't! My grandma used to say this was good for letting out all your anger. You try it. Go on, let out all your anger. That's it. Harder. One more time. That's it, very good. Very good. Well? It's tiring... Now we're going to make balls, like this, look. Nice and round. Shall I make the balls? OK, like this. Very good. Do you have parents? Well... I never met my dad and my mom left me with my grandma when I was 6. She raised me. We looked after a farm. Did I tell you? My grandparents live in the south. That's nice. Why do you talk like a woman? That's how I feel. You're going to look really lovely. Don't move, I'll paint your cheeks. Have I? Let's see, do this. I don't know the Pink Village. Is it far? It's a forbidden place. And your house? I made it under a tree. My friends' houses are all nearby. Just a short walk away. We all live under the trees and in my yard I have a river. A river just for you? For me and the other girls there. It's where we wash our clothes. Are there fruits in the trees? Many and of different colours. What are they called? Each fruit has the name of the person living under the tree. You see? So the fruit that grows over your house is called Ale? Yes. It must be strange. And the one over your house? It's strange too. I have to go. Julia. Afterwe parade. I'll get music. Ale. Come here. Look at this. What are you doing? Let go of the girl. Get out of here. Let go, Julie. No, no! Get out. I'll call the police. Let go, Ale, come back. Julia, Julia. Let me go! Are you OK? Did he do anything? Who painted your face like that? Did he do anything? Ale is the only one that loves me. Where is he? Ale's my mom. Daughter, please. Ale. What did you do to my daughter? Nothing, nothing! What do you want, you crazy fuck? Talk! Talk! Ale. Julia was growing up without me. Something had to change. I got up early, took out the car, bought a dress and some earrings. I spent a lot of money. I wouldn't ignore life any longer. I invited Julia to go out for a burger and fries. She loves that. Fries give me heartburn. Show the doctor how you're reading now. I learned to read thanks to Mia and Pedro. To Pedro, Mia's dead. I don't want you to go back to that house. We got into the car with Julia and went to get the burgers. We put on our song and sang it really loud. Julia was happy. But something changed suddenly. I went stiff and we crashed. Mia! Julia hurt her head and was unconscious. I locked myself in my room. I couldn't speak. I was scared to ask about my daughter. I think I killed her. Manuel comes into the room with Julia. Manuel, the calm willing man I loved, and Julia, smiling with a bandage on her head. One next to the other. They look well, without me. I think at times, we were happy together. Perhaps Julia will only remember that, the three of us, laughing. But I'm a monster inside a woman's body. The type of monsters children dream of. My child. You're better off, far from me. Who said you're better off far away? My mom abandonned me when I was 8. Yeah, you told me. In Formosa. Mine when I was 6. From the age of 6 to 10 I went to Paraguay to look for her. Then I came here on a truck. But I never found her. Can I pay you for the water tomorrow? Will you make me some pants? OK, hold this. This little girl was lucky. Lucky? She must tell her a lot here. She says she didn't want her, she was afraid of breast feeding, and one day she nearly killed her. Enough, Pedro. What kind of a mother is that? Here, Ale. My mom left it in my jacket pocket. It took me a long time to read it, but it's something. I understood something. What if I had a fag mother like you? I'd have a family. It's not the same. Stop mixing things. You're jealous, you fag? A wounded fag. How about that. Why do you have to see that girl again? You'll end up in jail and crazy! Mark my words. What do you know? Were you abandoned? What's the matter with you? Let her have a family. That's not a family. Hey, Carlitos, how about the girl for a family? Get lost! Monster, a monster, not a ghost. Why do you give her the water for free and make me sew you pants? For the baby. So it isn't thirsty. Ale, you found that girl in the garbage, you must get her out of there. You know what you have to do. Oh, no you don't. Not that. What you did was bad. Very, very bad. Don't ever do it again. Hey, what are you doing? Come on, inside. Your dad said to keep you inside if you didn't go to school. I don't care what he said. I beg your pardon? I'm fed up of you. Go inside! Dad, dad! You can shout all you like. Dad! Your dad's drunk on the sofa. Dad! Shout, let's see if he hears you. Sir, I've had enough. Don't shout at my daughter. Got it. Please go inside, sir. Don't shout at my daughter. No. Don't touch my daughter! No. Help me! Help me! No, leave me alone. Shut up! Dad. Calm down, come on. Dad, go inside! Calm down, Julia. Get in, you drunk! You drunk! Shut up! You drunk! Shut up! You drunk! I can't stand you. Don't talk that way to your father. You drunk! - Don't say that to your father. - You drunk! - Say you're sorry. - You drunk! Say you're sorry. That's enough. Say you're sorry. Say you're sorry. No! Yes. No! Do as I say. No. Come on, sir. Come on, the girl's watching. Come on, sir. Come on, sir. Give me a hand here. Hold on. Just a bit further. I don't know what to do. You can't do anything, in that state. Try to sleep. Don't go. Come here, sweetie. It would be for a few days. I'll pay you. So take it as a job. OK. Until we get someone. My mother's coming from the south to fetch her. We're going to live there. And Julia? She doesn't know her grandma's coming. She doesn't want to leave the house. All I want is for her to be calm. - OK. - Yeah. Well, it's getting late. I need a shower and... I'll see you later. OK? If you want I can take Julia to school. No thanks, I'll take her. Good morning. Good morning. And dad? I talked to him. He wants me to look after you. But... But what? You'll have to do what I ask, OK? Julie, put on the green sweater. It's cold. I'm coming. Sir, fix up your shirt in the back. Thanks. Come on Julie. It's getting late, please. Julia! I'm sorry for what I said yesterday. That's OK, don't worry. Have you got your pack? No she doesn't. Go on. Go get your pack. Go get it. Ale, if you could help me out. Sure. With something else. With what? The trip. To talk to her about going south? Yeah. Ready. Ready, what. Come here. Let's do your hair. We're accused of illegal occupation. We received intimidating letters. We were treated with violence. In order to avoid eviction we agree to meet you on Thursday or Friday to discuss this further. Thursday's a holiday. Just put Friday. Most of us make a living collecting garbage, cardboard, tin cans. We couldn't do this all crammed in a hotel. We want to negotiate, pay rent if necessary. With all our goodwill we look forward to our meeting with you next Thursday. Friday. A meeting next Friday together with the authorities, at your convenience. Thank you. Regards, The settlers of Pink Village. Does anyone have anything to add? No, no. Are we sure we want to go on living here? We can live like other people in a house. That's what we should ask for in this letter, Antigua. We have to be brave to take steps to have normal lives. To go out in the streets without ducking when a police car drives by. I thought you had a house. A house without gas, electricity or water. That's what I have. We choose to be here. It's our lot, Antigua. Maybe this is an opportunity. What opportunity? To stop living in the weeds. Where do you see weeds? I see a forest. And Julia? What happened? Did you forget to pick her up? I can go. Give me the address, I can go. I'll go and get my daughter. If you give me the address, I'll go, no problem. No. I don't want you to go. I can't let you go in that state. What makes you think I'll let you pick up my daughter from school? Let you near my daughter? Well, you need someone to help you and Julia chose me. I'm tired. Are you playing young Scissorhands? I'll do Scissorhands for you. I know someone who's like him. His eyes are like this. Is his name Edward? No, Carlitos. Come over here with the watering can. Doesn't he have parents? No, he was abandoned. In a castle? No, in Formosa. But first, she left him a letter, it's not the same as leaving nothing. And thanks to that letter from his mom, he understood many things about her. She didn't abandon him because she was mean but because... Of what? She was afraid. She felt like a monster for not looking after him like he deserved. A monster? Poor thing. She also said she was sorry and that he had to be strong and to always remember the nice moments they had. I think my mom committed suicide. Doing homework? I can't believe it. Yeah. I told Julia, you got back from work feeling sick. How do you feel now? Much better, thanks. Julia wants to go eat a hamburger. We wanted your permission. Not permission, money. You can rest. I'll take her. Or I'll have to clean up the cupboard. It looks like a rat's nest. No, that's enough for today. I wanted to spend some time with Julia. We can all go for a hamburger. Sure, but no. I wanted us to go out. Can Ale come? Julia, your dad wants to spend some time alone with you. I don't want to be alone with him. Julia. OK... Here's what we'll do. We'll take Ale home and then go. No, sir, thank you. See, behind those trees, that's where all the shacks are. One day, if you're bored, drop in. How about it? Sure. How much do I owe you? What can I say? Whatever you think. Thank you very much, sir. No, thank you, Ale. Before you go I wanted to tell you my mother called, she found a great school. That's lucky. When she calms down we're off. Don't worry, sir. Give her time. I want to give you something. No. But it's not for you. It's for Julia. Maybe it's good for her to know. No, thanks. What did you tell her when it happened? Well, we said her heart failed and she went to sleep. She didn't believe you. Ale! Hello there! Those are my friends, the girls from the slum. Bye. Well, look at her! What a gorgeous find! How you doing? Apart from worrying, It's tough on my own. Can't you see? That guy hit you. Come on, hold the braid. To be a mommy, you don't have to be beaten up. You don't understand, Pedro. Manuel is a good man. A good man, who beat you up. And you go on braiding his daughter's hair, like an asshole! Don't be such a sissy! Well, I won't leave them, Pedro. We're tramps. We'll always be on the outside looking at people drive in cars, eat in restaurants and live in houses. Always! And your grandma? You've never spoken about her. Her name is Nelida. She sobs every time we talk. That's because she's sad. And you won't even go and visit her. What if we run away and go to her house? Close your eyes till I'm done. My dad was born in the south. There's a big beach there. One day we had to stop the car because of a cow in the middle of the road. My dad tried to push it away but the cow chased him. My mom and I laughed. He laughed too, we all did. Don't you want to go back? No. Are your eyes closed or are you cheating? I can't see myself anyway. Now, have a look. Do you want makeup? Or leave you as you are? Manuel, sir, I left you some schitzels in the fridge for tonight. That's great. Just heat them up. I got fired from work. I have to keep going a few more days. I don't want to tell Julia yet. Jesus! What will you do now? I don't know. I saw it coming. They put up with me long enough. What will you do? I don't know. I spoke to my mother. She's arriving tomorrow. Tomorrow? So soon? Yeah. I... I'd like to see her in a good mood to tell her. Not yet, OK? I'll be right back. And the braid? It was uncomfortable. It looked so nice. Today I told Ale about the time you had to chase the cows. You told her that. Yeah, it makes me laugh. Yeah, you laugh at me. Ale asked me if I wanted to visit grandma. I said no, but... But what? It would be nice to go, in time. Now I'd like Ale, to look after me. How about it? Sounds fine. That's great, sweetie. I'm glad you think that way. Besides, grandma will spoil you, she'll take you everywhere. It's so nice there. It's so nice to travel. Let's celebrate. Let's go out for dinner. Can Ale come? No, thanks. I'll see you tomorrow. You're coming with us. We'll go to the pancake place. No, not there. Why not? We can go somewhere else. We can go somewhere... Be my guest. What's wrong? I've got nothing nice to wear. No, no. Why not? I said no. You're coming with us, Ale. You've got goose bumps. I'll get your sweater. No, I don't want one. I'm not cold. Are you sure? Yes. Do you like it? But, you're lovelier. Ale made it. Yeah. Good evening. Welcome. Come in. Good evening. We have a reservation. Third table, please. That one. The menu. Do you like it? It's been a while since we were here. True. Are you happy? Yes. Give me your glass. I'll pour more. I wanted Ale to see it. What's this one for? It's for the water. The wine goes in the small glass. Thank you. I want some coke. In a minute, sweetie. A coke, please. Here's some cheese. What a small spoon. I like your hairdo, Ale. Eat up. It'll get cold. I put hot pebbles inside. Careful now. That's got alcohol. You can't have that, Juli. It's ok, the alcohol bums up. I see! How old were you, Ale? I was the same age as Julie but I didn't have her lovely eyes. I lived alone with my grandma in a farm she minded. Just you and your grandma? Yes, and we looked after her friend's farm. A very elegant woman. She wore lovely suits, boots. And her hairdos... They drove me crazy. One day this woman arrives for the branding of cattle. I saw her walk through the gate and knew she held my fate in her hands. What was it? What was it? A fashion magazine. They went to the corral with my grandma, and she left the magazine on the table. Without a minute to lose I stole it and ran to the fields. I sat under a tree and began to discover a world of sequins, materials, hairdos, make up. That aroused the fag in me. So much so, that the next day I took my grandma's only dress and tumed it into a dress for me. The old woman's still after me, belt in hand. Imagine that. That's the story of how Ale changed her "gaucho" pants for a pretty skirt. More wine? Besides, Ale. Cheers. We have to celebrate. What? That your grandma's coming tomorrow. What for? To fetch you and tell you she's found a lovely school in the south. But I'm going there. Yes, but grandma insisted on coming to help you pack. You didn't tell me, dad! Fag! I don't want grandma to come. She wants to see you. Shall I tell her not to come? You lied to me. I won' t leave the house. I don't want another school and I don't want to travel. We're going south, that's final. I won't go anywhere. Don't yell. You're in a restaurant, don't make a scene. Oh, my mistake. I didn't know this was the fags toilet. I may be a fag, but I'm not a coward like you. Come here you son of a bitch. Come here. Say: I musn't ever humiliate someone. Say it! Say it! I mustn't ever humiliate... I can't hear you. I mustn't ever humiliate someone. I can't hear you, say it louder. I mustn't ever humiliate someone. You know what? I wouldn't have cared if I'd been alone, but, I won't let you humiliate me in front of my daughter, you fucking bastard! I need to spoil it all, so you won't miss me. In the last page I wrote what I want to tell you. My child, If I read it, maybe my voice will come from inside me. It was just the plug. How silly of me. I never tried. What time is your mother coming tomorrow? Midday. I can come early if you like and give the house a clean. When will you sleep, Ale? It's been a long day. Tell you what, we'll clean up the maid's room and you can sleep there. And after tomorrow, You don't need to come back. Ale... Thank you, Ale. My heart will go on beating inside you. Take out the teddy bear. Have you packed your bikini? Come sit here. My reason wants no pity, I'm ready to leave. I'm not afraid of the ritual of death. I'll fall asleep and begin to fade. A story will remember me... alive. I see, fields, fruits, honey and a longing for love. Being forgotten won't defeat me, today as yesterday, I'll return, through my child I can always return, renewed. As daylight burns out in the sky I'll be going. I'll leave with my shaking body And a hoarse voice from screaming, I will return. Spreading my song in the air forever. Julia, Julia, Julia. Wake up... What is it? Nothing. Don't make any noise. Come on... without making noise. Come on... Where are we going? Don't be afraid... I want my daddy. What happened? Tell me Were are you going?
