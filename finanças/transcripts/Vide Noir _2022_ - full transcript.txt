[♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [vomits] [music playing in background] [grunts] [pants] [♪♪♪] [crickets chirping in background] [owl hooting in distance] [♪♪♪] [Buck] Ah, good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome back to the program. This is your host Buck Vernon. [chuckles] And joining us this evening, is the lovely Lee Green. [Lee chuckles] How the hell are you, Lee? I am fine, thank you very much. Well, I'm very glad to hear that. Folks, uh, this young lady has a voice like no other, as you'll soon hear. But I just wish you could see her. [crickets chirping in background] [♪♪♪] [indistinct chatter in distance] [♪♪♪] Hello? [Lady Moonbeam] Welcome traveler. You have entered the realm of Lady Moonbeam. You have journeyed far. From out beyond the sunrise. You have come in search of someone. I see a woman. Can you see what she is? [Lee] When are we gonna get out of here? [sighs] Under what sign was she born? Her birthday is in May. [Lady Moonbeam] Hmm. It is difficult to see. Yes, you can still find her. You must follow the emerald star. [Lee] When are we gonna get out of here? [Buck] Soon, I'm working on it. [Lee] But when? [Buck] You just gotta be patient. And once we've saved up a bit, we can go wherever you like. Promise me. I promise. [♪♪♪] [electricity zapping] [♪♪♪] Um, whiskey and soda, please. Coming right up, sir. Thanks. Listen, um, I'm looking for someone. Yeah, she's a. She was a singer. Moved out from Detroit a few months back. - I think she works... - No, I'm afraid I can't help you with that one, sir. Alright, thanks, buddy. [Frankie] In the silence of the dark In the silence of the new When the ocean meets the shore Till we open up the doors I'll be waiting there for you So, who's this singer? She's great. Singer? I don't know what you mean. The singer. The woman with the band. The band is playing instrumentals tonight, sir. This band used to have a great singer. Frankie Lou. Beautiful voice. Incredible. She passed away last year. Murdered, along with her lover. They called it a double suicide. But they got it wrong. Somebody black-brained 'em. They said she was a princess back in China. So tragic. So, you looking to do some drifting tonight, young man? Excuse me? You looking for some Vide Noir? - What's... - [audience applauding] [indistinct chatter in background] [woman vocalizing] Oh, ah. [chuckles] Excuse me. [Frankie] I'm sure it's nothing you haven't seen before. [sighs] Since you're here would you mind handing me that dress? The gold one. Uh, sure. This one? Thank you. Ah, you sounded great out there. [Frankie] Thanks. My name is Buck. [Frankie] Thanks, Buck. I'm Frankie. Nice to meet you. So um, someone told me you're a Chinese princess. [Frankie chuckles] I'm not even Chinese. I'm Cambodian. Oh. Um. Um. Someone also told me that you're um. dead. Does that bother you? Ah, maybe you can help me. I'm looking for someone. - She's a singer, too. - Yeah. I know who you're looking for. But I wouldn't go around asking about her. Why is that? She's Z'Oiseau's new girl. Who? Who is uh, Z'Oiseau? [Frankie chuckles] Z'Oiseau owns this place. He's not really someone you wanna mess around with. That's all the more reason to find her. Listen to me, Buck. I suggest you turn around right now and go back to wherever you came from. I'm afraid I can't do that. Must be true love then. You have any idea where she might be? Maybe try the farthest reaches of the cosmos. - What? - [Frankie] She's a skygazer. Z'Oiseau's got her hooked on Vide Noir. What is that stuff? What does it do? That's not really an easy thing to explain. Look, can you give it a try. Z'Oiseau always said it helped obliterate the self and the boundaries of space and time. I guess it helps you. Experience things. What, like LSD? [Frankie] Comparing Vide Noir to LSD is like comparing a spaceship to a Greyhound bus. They both take you to strange places. But the question is, how far out do you wanna go? Have you tried it? Well, have you? Get out of here. Can't you see I'm busy. I'm sorry. Um, I'm sorry for whatever happened to you. I just wanna find her. [sighs] So where did you learn to sing like that, anyway? I always loved to sing. I'm no princess, but I come from a prominent family. And when it became clear that war was on its way, they sent me here. It was like a whole new life for me. And one night, Z'Oiseau comes in. He was so handsome. After my set, came back to my dressing room and spoke to me in Khmer. It was a pretty lame pick-up, but I was impressed. He could be a charming bastard. He told me about the club he was going to open and hired me on the spot. And I started singing here. And It wasn't until much later I realized. He was just using me. Using you for what? [Frankie] Years back, before the war really started, he was in Vietnam doing reconnaissance for the army. His unit was ambushed by guerillas. And Z'Oiseau disappeared. All they found was his hand. Two years later, he appears at a US base in Cambodia. He claims he was imprisoned and that one day his captors just let him go. No one really knows What happened to him in those two years. He found something in that jungle. Something dark. Something old. [Buck] Vide Noir. [Frankie] He gave it that name. Where I come from, it's known by other, more ancient names. I wish I never helped him. I wish I never met him. But. it's too late now. [crowd cheering, applauding in background] I gotta get back out there. Uh, wait. Where can I find her? [indistinct chatter] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [indistinct chatter] Uh, hey, hi. Um, I heard this singer's really great. Do you know when she's playing here next? Oh, she won't be here all week. They got her stuck at the studio every night cutting a record. They say she's gonna be the next big thing. Uh, sorry. You wouldn't happen to know what studio? [chuckles] Well, lover boy. [indistinct chatter] Oh, that can't be good. If they're here, then somebody's making trouble for the boss man. [indistinct chatter in background] [taking deep breaths] - [grunts] - [dog barking] [man #1] Why did you run away from us? [♪♪♪] [indistinct chatter in background] [banging on door] [Big Guy] Can I help you? This is a closed session. Uh, yeah, I'm here for the session. You're not Davy? Uh, no. Davy's sick. Yeah, he's got the flu. Puking his brains out. So he sent me to cover for him. Where's your guitar? I... I left in the car actually. Well, geez, man. You lucky we're desperate. Go on, hurry up and get it. Hurry up! Shit. What's that? It's my guitar. Well, damn, you better hope that's enchanted or some shit. Get your ass up in there. [♪♪♪] [winds howling] Hey, fellas. Davy's sick. I'm Buck. This mic just for me? For the solo. Great. Alright, now that we have a band, we ready to get a take yet? Good. Hey, man, uh, I didn't get a chance to look at the tune. Chart's right there, man. Yeah, maybe you could show me the changes real quick. Are you fucking kidding me? [chuckles] Yeah, man, just. Just messing around. Say, where's Fleur? Who? The singer. How the hell should I know, man? Never laid eyes on her. I just show up and play. [saxophone player] She doesn't show for sessions, man. I mean the one time she did, she was messed up. High out of her mind. Look, she's a looker, don't get me wrong, okay, but she's a junkie. Just another piece of runaway trash. Listen here, you little twerp, you better watch what you say. Hey, are you fellows done talking? You ready to roll? Good. Amateurs. And we are rolling. [♪♪♪] Cut, cut. Guitar player, what the hell are you doing? We need you from the top. Uh, yup. It's my fault. Uh, I got it now. Sorry. Oh Jesus, who is this clown? [♪♪♪] [bass player] Isn't that Davy? Well, I'll be damned. Back on his feet. That's a speedy recovery. Uh, guess you won't be needing me after all. It was lovely meeting you all. You sound great. Except you, you're an asshole. If I see you again, I'm gonna punch your lights out. What the hell is going on? Davy, my man. Good to see you feeling better. - I'll just be on my way. - I don't know this guy. - I've never seen him before. - Oh, Davy! - You old kidder, you! - Now hold on just a... - Hey! Hey! - A goddamn minute, man! Hey pal. Why'd you run away from us? Why don't you slide over and let old Hontanx drive? Found your little pea shooter in the trunk. It's cute. What you need this thing for, huh? Um, my cousin Fritz gave it to me. - Hmm. - Shooting squirrels. [laughing] Squirrels. Hey, you're a really funny guy. You should be a talk show host. [sighs] Listen, fellas, I don't know what you think. Hey, just stop it right there, okay, pal. We don't really care what you have to say. So just save your breath. I'm just trying to find... [gasps] Buck? Lee? [pants] Go back to bed, hmm? Let's sleep. [Lee] Buck. [♪♪♪] [Jasper] You sure you don't want a girl for yourself? Oh, you'd rather get some shuteye. Alright, well, I'll be ten minutes tops, alright? [♪♪♪] Dammit. [woman #1] Would you just knock it off? [indistinct speech] [indistinct argument in distance] [♪♪♪] [indistinct TV chatter in distance] [TV show host] Don't forget to catch. - [indistinct speech] - [snoring] One of my all-time favorite films. [indistinct speech] Starring one and only Roy Casey. It's a tragic tale of love and redemption set against the dramatic backdrop of the American southwest. Full to the brim with romance, adventure, and great teams to boot, a hell of a fine motion picture. Now don't you miss it. Now Roy Casey, now he was a good friend of yours, as I recall. Of course, he was a good friend of mine, too. But you guys were in the army together or something, ain't that right? I imagine that's a... A special kind of bond, eh? When you've been through. [♪♪♪] [engine starts] [♪♪♪] Jesus, I'm so sick of this weather! I'm so sick of that goddamn dive! Buck, are we going home? Yeah. We gotta get out of this place. Buck. are we just gonna stay here all our lives? Doing nothing? Oh no, of course not. Told you we just got to... Yeah, you've been saying a lot, but here we are. I am... I... I am working on things, - but Lee... - Oh. [crying] See that's what I should be doing Buck, singing not serving beers to plant workers in that shithole. - I know, Lee, I really do. - Do you? Do you, Buck? Then why are we still here? What are you so afraid of? We could just pack up and go. It doesn't work like that. [sobs] Lee. [sighs, sniffles] Hey, Lee? [♪♪♪] Fuck! [♪♪♪] [Johnnie] Alright, hands off, bub. [grunts] You got a smoke? Yeah. So, who the hell are you? Another one of Zazo's boys? What more can you guys do to me? No, I... I just got away from them myself. Alright, I think, maybe they were bringing me out here to do whatever it is they did to you. [Johnnie] Oh yeah? You should feel damn lucky they didn't. [Buck] Yeah, I guess so. What did they do to you? [Johnnie] Those fuckers black-brained me! Poured enough Vide Noir down my throat to shoot me to the edge of the universe and back! - An overdose? - Yeah. It's how they like to do people. Why? Because they're psychotic assholes! But why you? [♪♪♪] I fucked up. I thought I could get the Enders in on the Vide Noir game. [Buck] The Enders? The World Enders? What, you haven't heard of us? I'm from out of town. [Johnnie] Shit, man, we're only some of the baddest sons of bitches in this city. - Yeah, I don't doubt it. - Yeah, damn right. You know my brother Alex, sort of runs the show. He's not so hot on the idea. He doesn't think in the gang into that sort of shit, it's the best idea but I keep telling him, man, it's the future! We can't get by stealing cars no more. So I figured I'd take matters into my own hands, right. But I fucked it up. So that's when they brought me out here and. This Zazo guy. .He's different. [♪♪♪] He's got a real evil inside him or something. Yeah. So I've heard. - I'm trying to find him. - [Johnnie] Oh yeah? I wouldn't recommend it. You ever... you ever meet his... His girlfriend? Oh, you mean that blonde biscuit? I seen her around a couple of times. She looks like a movie star. Barely looked at me, but I got a good look at her. [laughs] What, you know her or something? She's my fiancé. [laughs] Oh shit, man. That's rough. Fiancé, oh. [♪♪♪] Maybe I should head out of here. [Johnnie] Oh, what come on, man. You know, a couple of brainless dudes drag you out into the desert and you're gonna what? Just up and quit? You just told me I should stay away. Yeah, man, that was before I knew about the girl. Look, I'd give anything to be in your shoes right now. [chuckles] To be alive! In love! All revved up with nothing to lose! [chuckles] Hot damn, man! Ah. Sure beats being a ghost. You know, the whole crew's probably wondering what the hell happened to me. Hey. why don't you find them? My brother, you could tell him what happened. He'll fucking start a war against that asshole if he found out what happened to me. And he'll help you out for sure, man. He'll help you get your girl back. - I don't know. - Come on, man. She's probably just sitting there waiting for you to come and save her from that psycho. You know, she's in some real danger right now. You gotta be a man! - Don't be a fucking coward! - I'm not afraid of him. - Oh yeah? - I'm not. Well, prove it. Yeah! That's what I'm talking about. Some passion, lightning, fire! [screams] Where would I find your brother? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Alright, we... We've got a clubhouse down in the warehouse district. It's... it's east of the river on Grove Street, alright. - Uh, what... what day is that? - Why? Today, today, what day of the week is it? - Friday. - Oh perfect. He'll be there tonight for sure. The Phantom Riders are playing. [chuckles] Here, you give him this. He'll know what it means. - How will I know him? - He's tall. He's got a big scar on his cheek, you can't miss him. And you're sure he'll help me? You show him that. He'll help you. Say uh, you think I can get another smoke? [♪♪♪] [chuckles] Thanks. I hope you get your girl back. And don't get black-brained, that's just the fucking worst. So long, bub. Yeah. So long.

[World Ender #1] Yeah, whatcha looking for? - You a cop or something? - I was just looking for Alex. What makes you think Alex wants to see you, huh? [Lady Moonbeam] Hey, I know him, alright? So, just, back off. Oh, yeah? Well, whether you know him or not I don't like him nosing around back here. [man in club] Cops! [people shouting] [♪♪♪] [Lady Moonbeam] What the hell are you doing here? You remember me? [Lady Moonbeam] [chuckles] How can I forget? Did you follow me or something? No. No, I just followed your advice. - "Follow the Emerald Star". - [chuckles] You know, that that's just all a bunch of bullshit, right? [chuckles] I'm not a real psychic. There are no real psychics. Well, it brought me here. [Lady Moonbeam] [chuckles] Whatever you say. Maybe you can do it again, tell my fortune. Did you just hear what I said? Look, I don't know what else to do. And I just need to find her. I'm sorry, but I can't help you. Do you know Alex? Can you get a message to him? Yeah, but why? What message? - It's about his brother. - Johnnie? What about him? Where is he? He's dead. Murdered by a guy named Z'Oiseau. Jesus, Johnnie, you idiot. You know him? Z'Oiseau? I've heard of him. Johnnie. was on about some arcade where he's selling that new stuff. - [sighs] - You know where I can find him? Find him? You crazy? I think if I find him, then I'll find the girl I'm looking for. But she left you. What? No, she just left town. She had come out here to sing. - She... - Just leave it alone. Just... just let it go. Doesn't take a fortune teller to see where you're headed - with all of this. - You just don't understand. And you don't know what we had. - Had. - No! No. Please, there's gotta be some way you can help me. I think you might need a different sort of help. You mentioned an arcade before? - Oh my God! - Where is it? Just let it go! Look what happened to Johnnie messing around with those guys. Don't be an idiot. I'm not turning back, alright. I won't. I'm gonna keep going, whether you help me or not. She's in trouble. She's in trouble and I need to help her. If I can just see her again. If I could just talk to her. Fine. Your funeral. There's this lowlife, Tobey. I guess he's Z'Oiseau's nephew or something. He's selling that stuff out of some pinball joint on Virginia Avenue. Trying to get some teenagers to do it. And? That's it. Dammit, Johnnie. Is he really dead? Yeah, he is. I'll get the word out to Alex. After this shit tonight with the cops, it's gonna be a little while until I can find him. Looks like the coast is clear. There's a ladder up there, up in the river. Thanks for your help. [Lady Moonbeam] I think you ought to reconsider. [Buck] "Follow the Emerald Star." How'd you come up with that? Like I said, it's just a bunch of bullshit. [chuckles] Emerald is her birthstone. Throw in something cosmic. I don't know, it just popped into my head. Or maybe you really are psychic. [chuckles] Yeah. maybe. I'll see you around. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [indistinct chatter & laughter] Tobey? [Tobey] Who wants to know? I'm looking to do some drifting. Oh yeah? [Buck] I hear you're the guy to see. Yeah, I might be able to help you out with that. But first, why don't you tell me how you heard about me? It's from your uncle, of course. My uncle? I work for him. I ain't never seen you around the club. I'll level with you, Tobey. Your uncle hired me to come down here and check out your little operation. What? Oh shit. Look, I... I didn't think he knew. Listen, if this is about me selling Vide Noir, I'll stop. Relax, Tobey relax. He's not mad. In fact, he respects that you took some initiative. - Really? - Oh yeah. You know he speaks very highly of you. He's starting to think about who's gonna take over one day. - He said that? - Sure, he did. Why do you think he sent me out here to check things out? So what are you gonna tell him? You know, Tobey, I'll be honest. I'm impressed. I'm very impressed. But the tickets and all that? Very clever. You know, he... he asked me to poke around here on the sly, but when I saw what you got going on, I said, "I gotta meet this kid." And you're gonna tell him all that? Shit, yeah. Yeah, of c... You know, I was supposed to meet with him tomorrow at the club, but do you know what? I think I'm so excited I'm gonna go down there - right now and tell him. - Yeah? He's gonna be so damn proud. You think he's up at the house tonight? - Maybe I'll swing by. - I guess so. Jasper is coming by again soon. He'll know. Listen, I don't wanna bug Jasper with this. You know, you probably shouldn't even mention it. I think he's hoping to wear the crown someday, you know what I'm saying? I'll just go up there and see if he's there. [chuckles] Damn. You know, I always forget where that house is. What's the best way to get up there from here? It's easy, you just head right up. Wait a second. Jasper said somebody might be coming around asking questions about my uncle. You're him, ain't ya? Hey easy, now. [laughs] - Okay, take it easy. - I don't know. I mean, what you want from him anyway? Uh, it's not him. It's his girlfriend. [laughs] What's so funny? Oh man. I mean Jasper said that you were pathetic, but wow. You really think that you can compete with my uncle? He makes you look a little turd. You know, my uncle's probably banging that sweet girl of yours right now. Showing her what a real man is like, not some poor piece of trash like you. [screams] You got a big mouth, Tobey. So why don't you tell me Where your uncle's house is? Fuck you, shithead! You're so dead! [screams] Where is it? Where is it! It's up at the top of Mt. Monroe! It's the only house up there. [grunting] [♪♪♪] [sighs] [taking deep breaths] [♪♪♪] [sighs] [taking deep breaths] [♪♪♪] [indistinct chatter in background] - Hey. - Hi. That's gonna be you someday. Wanna come with me? - Outside? - Yeah. Where are we going? Well, I... I know that you've been wanting to get into a recording studio and I figured until we can get you the real thing, you could have a go in here. [chuckles] Gonna back you up. Sweet, Buck, it's really sweet um... [Buck] Yeah. So come on, come on. Let's go. [both clear throat] Okay. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I'm your host Buck Vernon. Joining us tonight on the program is the lovely Lee Green. How the hell are you, Lee? I am fine, thank you very much. Alright. Well, I'm... I'm very glad to hear that. Uh, folks, as you'll- as you'll soon hear this lovely lady has a wonderful voice, uh, but I just wish you could see her, because she's quite the knockout. Yeah, and if I'm being honest, I'm having trouble keeping my hands to myself, you know... - Keep 'em to yourself. - Okay, alright. - [chuckles] - Enough with the chitchat, let's... let's hear that voice of yours, huh? [clears throat] You ready? [Buck clears throat] Okay. [Lee vocalizing] Let's go. [indistinct speech] [indistinct speech] [Lee chuckles] Yeah. Oh, it's beautiful. [grunting] You ain't going anywhere this time, punk. [Hontanx laughs] [clock ticking] [♪♪♪] [coughs, retches] [pants] [♪♪♪] [grunting] [♪♪♪] [taking deep breaths] [♪♪♪] [taking deep breaths] [hooting & chirping in background] [♪♪♪] Hey. Hey, honey, it's me Buck. Lee, can you hear me? Lee? [Z'Oiseau] Good evening. [Buck] Don't come any closer. To whom do I owe the pleasure? Name's Buck. I'm here for Lee. If you say so. I'm taking her home with me. You must be the one that's been causing all the trouble this evening. You've really upset my boys. Yeah, well, they really upset me. I'm gonna be honest with you, Buck. She never mentioned you. Not once. Oh, I wouldn't be surprised if there were 10 others like you. She has a certain power. Are you the one that gave her the emerald ring? That's right. It was my mother's. It's beautiful. I suppose that's what led you here. It called you, like the Tartalo. That's a old legend from where my family came from. I'm fond of legends. There can be a lot of truth found in them, don't you think? Never really thought about it. Hmm. [Buck] I'm taking Lee with me. - Who? - Lee! Oh. I call her, "Fleur". [Buck] So, I've heard. Do you know why, huh? That too is an old tale. [speaks French] The Beautiful Wildflower. My mother used to tell it to me. Like all legends, there's a lot of variations. It's about a flower. As you probably could imagine, that grows way, way up in the mountains. The most beautiful flower in all the world. And it's old, ancient, as old as the mountain itself. Brave men would quest for the flower, but none could possess it. Those that would seek it find only. Death. and despair. There's more to it, but you get the idea. Don't you touch her! She is the flower. And we are the seekers. And we can never possess her. And even if we could, everything in our garden would wilt from shame. And die. [chuckles] Lee. Lee, come on, honey, we need to get out of here. What about your name? Buck? Sounds like the stuff legends are made of. What does it mean? Doesn't mean anything. It's just what my mother decided to call me. My mother named me as well. Zozo. It's Euskara, it means black bird because of my hair. It was a nickname, but it stuck. Also, meant fool, which was the version that my brothers preferred, so I changed it to the French, Z'Oiseau. Lee, Lee, come on, we need to get out of here. They're all dead now, my brothers. What's wrong with her? Wrong? I wouldn't say that there's anything wrong with her. She's just off somewhere very distant. Learning secret truths. She takes it strong. Like you, I suppose. - And not by choice. - No. Apologies. I'm amazed that you're even standing here. Yeah. I met a few more people you black-brained along the way. A singer named Frankie Lou, a kid named Johnnie, is that how you solve all your problems? I hope you found it interesting, at least. Maybe enjoy it a little. I still don't understand what it does. Yeah, it does whatever you need it to. It shows you what you need to see. What did you see, Buck? Tell me what you saw. At first, it seemed to make me forget everything. I didn't know who I was. [Z'Oiseau] Did you know before? Do you know now? It removes the barriers between time, and space, and death. Sometimes forgetting is part of that. One must destroy psychological continuity if one is going to obliterate the illusion of self. I don't know anything about that. But you can keep it. I'm taking Lee with me. Don't try and stop me. [gunshot] [taking deep breaths] Oh. Buck? What are you doing here? I came for you. I came to take you out of here. To take you back with me. What? I can't believe I finally found you. You look beautiful, Lee. Um. how did you find me? Jesus, are you bleeding? That's a long story. So you came all the way from Detroit? I drove out in the Impala. It's parked right out there in the woods, ready to take us out of here. Out of here? [Buck] Yeah, back to Detroit. But I'm not going back to Detroit, Buck. I live here now. Come on, Lee. This place, this life, it isn't you. Buck. Alright. Okay, we don't... We don't have to go back to Detroit. We... we could stay here a while if you want. We'll find a nice little place to live and I'll get a job working roads. Lord knows they got plenty of 'em out here. I must've seen just about all of 'em looking for you. I could have come, you know? If you had just asked me. I would have come, Lee. - I love you. - No. I left you, Buck. Don't you get that? I didn't want you to know where I was going. I didn't want you to come after me. I didn't want you to find me. But you're still wearing your ring? Doesn't that mean something? Doesn't that mean there's still a chance? A chance for what? For us. You know, getting married and all that. Married? Buck, are you crazy? There's absolutely no chance we're getting married. Okay. We don't have to get married right way. No, Buck! Never! I don't wanna be with you, Buck. I don't love you. [cries] But I. I came all this way. For you. I'm sorry, Buck, but you shouldn't have done that. You really shouldn't have done that. [Lee crying] What's he got that I don't got? Huh? Tell me! Ambition. Money. He's helping me get my singing career going. He's got me in a real recording studio. He's just about everything you're not, Buck. [sniffles] But the ring. It's a pretty ring. I do like it. I think you should have it back. You shouldn't have come here, Buck. [winds howling] [taking deep breaths] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪]
