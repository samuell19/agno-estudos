Police! Police! -Pigs! -Kiddo, look out! Knife! Knife! Drop the weapon! Drop the weapon! Fuck! Thank you! You're dead, Kiddo. That couldn't happen to me. Especially with my new boots. I just bought them. Original SWAT from America. -They ain't SWAT. -Of course, dude. Can't you read? What you gonna do with them? Play paintball? Yep. You can't wear them on an operation anyway. Sadly. But they're nice. You're no longer simple beat cops. You're with WEGA now. Being allowed to wear the red beret is a distinction given only to the best. Unfortunately, not everyone sitting here will survive and successfully graduate. What's most important for WEGA? Teamwork. Sticking together. Do that, and WEGA will become your family. It won't be you coming to WEGA, but WEGA coming to you. So. With these words I officially welcome you to phase two. Starting today you can prove yourselves on the streets. So, Toni, why do you wanna join WEGA? For the action, of course. And you, Kiddo? I always knew. Already as a little boy I wanted to join WEGA. To do what? Well. To protect people from all the crazies running around. Dispatch to sector three. What's your status? Over. Sector three to dispatch. We're ready for dispatch. Over. Roger. We have a request from the colleagues in the district. The address is 8 Weiglgasse street. A noise disturbance, but the party might be dangerous. Over. Roger that. We're on our way. Thanks. You're welcome! So, gentlemen, what does WEGA stand for? We'll gladly handle anything! That's right. Fasten your straps. Have fun schlepping. Put your kids to bed. Great, here comes WEGA! Put him away, he's always causing trouble. Go inside and close the door. He's dangerous! Please, calmly tell us what happened. Nothing happened. No need for the cops. Why are you all here? I've already explained it ten times. A neighbor complained that you were loud all night. -What neighbor? He's a salty asshole! -Mr. Malinowski, please... Open the door and show me your hands! What's the situation? The customer's name is Harald Malinowski. We know him well. He repeatedly suffers from schizophrenic episodes. A neighbor called because he apparently threatened him. But I know him. He's just a little crazy. Really sad. Is he alone, is anyone else inside? -No, I don't believe so. -What's that? I don't believe there's anyone else inside. Believing is for church. Is he armed? Are you armed, Mr. Malinowski? Okay, formation. Step back. Listen, this really isn't necessary. You called us. -I called you in as backup. -Step back! Mr. Malinowski, you're making things worse... Step back! I said! Piss off! Police, open the door! What do you want from me? Piss off! Shit. Leave it. Give it to me. Knife! Knife! Fuck! DAD Kiddo! That was awesome! It was insane. You're a hero. You're my hero. Yeah? Yeah, awesome. Without you, my daughter wouldn't have a father today. Dude, we taught that psycho a lesson! Let's get outta here before the press pounces on us. And tomorrow's a fresh start! What's up with you? Nothing's up with me. Hey. Where were you so long? Saving the world. Oh, yeah? Yeah. -Yeah? -Yeah. And you? Studying. -Studying? -Studying, studying. Studying, studying, studying... No more studying. -No more studying? -No more. -Oh, come on. -No more studying. -Why? I need to study. You know that. -Nope. Not with a boyfriend like that. Not with a boyfriend like that? Because he'll take all my exams for me? -Exactly. -Yeah? Because he'll take all your exams for you. -Really? -Yeah. Say it again. -I'll take all your exams. -Wow. Well then. Help me out here. -What's up with you? -What's that look? I dunno. -I'm in a good mood. -Yeah, I noticed. I saved Blago's life today. You did what? I saved Blago's life. What, what, what? What happened? Some psycho. He totally took a stab at him. Crazy. You okay? Of course I'm okay! I'm good, dude. I'm so good. And? You should see the other guy, he's not so good. Why, what do you mean? I shot him. What, what, what? Fuck. Honest. I saved Blago's life. You understand? He took a stab at him, "Bam, bam, bam." And then I went, "Blam, blam, blam." Shot him. Dude, Blago would be dead. You get it? And the other guy? Did you kill him or what? Nah, he's still alive. You get it? I saved Blago's life. His daughter still has a dad because of me. Kiddo! Kiddo! Kiddo! Kiddo! World-class action. Super! Come here! You're amazing. Thanks, guys. Congrats. Come in. Ah, Chris. Come in. Hey. Chris, this is Detective Hofer. He has a few questions about yesterday. Nothing upsetting. Right, Rudi? Yes. Officer, please, briefly tell me from your perspective what happened yesterday. Yes, well... My colleague and I, we were called to duty. There was another colleague with us. Mr. Woschitz. Really all because of a harmless noise disturbance-- What the detective wants to know about is the use of firearm. Yeah. Well... My superior used the battering ram to get into the apartment and-- The individual wanted to stab me, and the officer provided emergency assistance under dangerous circumstances. That's right, yes. When I was as old as you, people still crossed to the other side of the street when they saw an officer. Nowadays you can't even give someone a mean look without the self-proclaimed do-gooders getting all upset. They want to take things so far that we fear doing our job. But with you, things are different. Konsti has always had a good nose for exceptional talent. So I think we're done here, right? I think this is a clear case of emergency assistance. Super. You're dismissed. -Bye. -Thank you. Hi, Christoph. Hello. Were you able to sleep? Yeah, like a baby. I recommend giving you two, three weeks off. No, thanks. I don't need a holiday. It's not a holiday, it's sick leave. Oh. No. I'm never sick. Being sick is for others. Look, this is a traumatic experience. Not a cold. You're not going to get better in two days. If I take sick leave now, it's all over with WEGA. You understand? I can't afford that right now. Take this with you. It's the Ministry of the Interior's psychological service. Look it over. We done? We're done, yes. Have a nice day. Bye. Kiddo, what's up? You need an extra invitation? Derby! It's on! SCR rules! SCR rules! SCR rules! To the left! Form a chain at the fence. March! Fuck you, guys! Sons of bitches, dude. Pigs! Pigs! Pigs! Hey, Konstantin. Heinzi. The boys are a bit over-motivated today. The boys are a bit over-motivated today. Don't let them provoke you. It all depends on how your protégés behave, huh? What's he doing here? He should be on leave. -The boy's fit. -That's nonsense. What are you doing here? Do you know him? I'm on duty. Yeah, that's why I'm asking. You shouldn't be here. You should be on leave. This is nonsense. You're also on duty, so... What do we have here? Family constellations? Until now it was a conversation between men. Get out of here. Hey, come on! Don't be so dumb! Let's go, come on, fetch him out! Fucking pigs! Pigs! Pigs! Pigs! Think you can fuck us up, huh? Kiddo, you crazy? -Dad. -Yeah? Let me in. Just a moment. Not in a moment, now. I'll be done in a second. Let me in now. When's your next performance review? Why are you asking? Come on, we've talked about it so many times. I'm 44, not 64. Exactly. That makes you a dinosaur at WEGA. You've got a bad back. You're in constant pain. Now would really be the right time. I can't quit now. One of my boys needs me. I've waited ten years for this promotion. When I'll be working more, I won't be able to take care of Charlotte all the time anymore. Charlotte is 15, she can take care of herself. You know that's not true. Hey, big guy. How are you? Are things good with dad? You got fat. Now you really look like Baloo. Look, this is Nicky, Baloo. "Hello, Nicky. I'm Baloo." Come on. Food's ready. So. Come on, kids. Here we go! Dad, I told you: no noodles. I know, this is lasagna. That's shitty carbs. I can't eat that. What's that? It's full of bad carbohydrates. I'll blow up. I can't eat that. What do you want me to do? You want some bread and butter? It's all right, I'll have some salad. You're old enough, you can do what you want. Nicky, you want some? Yeah. I'll give you an end piece. We'll eat these shitty carbs. Thanks. How long have you been together now? Six months. -No! -Yeah. That's crazy. He doesn't tell me anything. I don't believe it. -Oh, yeah? -Yeah. Bon appétit. -Enjoy your meal. -Enjoy your meal. Christoph mentioned that you used to be stationed on Karlsplatz square. Yeah. Dad was captain of the police station on Karlsplatz square. And how was it? How was it... Well, frustrating. Really you only have two options: either you become numb or it wears you out eventually. For me it was actually a creeping process, and at some point it was a proper depression. Burnout is what it's called today, right? Sounds cooler, burnout. Well, it's crap. He doesn't like to hear about it. We don't talk about such things, right? And as fan liaison officer it's not as frustrating now? No comparison. I like my boys, you know. Of course there are a couple brats amongst them, no question, but... "Your boys"? What do you mean "your boys"? You're a police officer and not a social worker. What do you mean? Of course I'm a police officer, but there's not just one type of officer, there are many types of officers. Yeah, thank God. Not every officer is a reserve Rambo like you. Without us reserve Rambos all hell would have broken loose at the match. You can see it like that, or you can see it differently. -Okay. -Maybe all hell broke loose precisely because of you reserve Rambos. Definitely. Yeah, of course. Well, then explain this to me: What sense does it make to punch a fan like a crazy person when he's already on the floor. What sense does that make? Tell me! That was no fan! It was a hooligan! -Hooligan? -Yes! Someone has to stand in the way of those psychos. What do you think he'd have done to us? He started throwing things. So there's one psycho standing in the way of another psycho. What sense does that make? Come on. -Oh, leave it alone. -Yeah, let's leave it alone, please. Wussy. Come on. Relax. Take it easy. Did I hurt you? No, it's all right. How are you, Kiddo? Good as always. You sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Again. Did I hurt you? Konsti? Did I hurt you? Come on, I'll help you up. Sorry. Why are you lying to me? What? What do you mean? Do you think I'm an idiot? What was up with you at the stadium? Nothing! Nothing was up. That was just because of my dad. I can't afford high risk patients. I have to be able to rely 100 percent on my guys. I've got it under control! If I notice that you're becoming a problem, I'll have to throw you out. Just like anyone else. Yeah. Okay. You don't have any plans tonight, right? Why? We're having a party at our place. You can bring your boyfriend. Just kidding. You have a girlfriend? Yeah. Good, bring her along. All right. Great. See ya'! You're also a police officer? No. Not yet. I'm finishing up at the academy. I'm with the robbery squad. Yeah, I know that. I'd also really like to work there... Oh, yeah? Very nice. We could use more smart women. I'm being promoted to head of department, get in touch once you're done with training. I'd love that, thank you. You want to hand this out? Okay... Here's a beer for the spring chicken. Thanks. -Cheers! -Cheers! Cheers! Hey, that's my song! Last night Was a hard night for me I can't remember What happened yesterday And she's saying "If you ever come home like that again We're getting divorced If you ever come home like that again..." ACCESS FORBIDDEN Charlie! Charlie! We said no locked doors. Charlie is of an age where you just can't do anything right. You can't carry your point? Unfortunately my family's not organized like WEGA. There's also no women at WEGA. Yeah... So... It's our turn. What do you mean? -No. -Sure. -Please don't! -Come on! -Please don't! -Come on! I'm throwing my hat on everything Today I'm not doing anything At least nothing that stresses me Worries, I push them away And say nothing happened Because today is a celebration of life There's no boss here screaming And no stress near or far No one bothering me Because it just doesn't interest me Someone please stop time Because today everything Is wonderful and pleasing... Better get used to it: as of now you gotta share him. It could stay like this forever... With WEGA. Someone please stop time Otherwise everything wonderful Will quickly pass by The way it is right now It could stay like this forever! All right. Hey, I gotta go. Yes. All right. Take care. Bye. Hey! What are you doing here? Picking you up. -Thanks. -You're welcome. YO KILLER, HAVE YOU SEEN? PSYCHO'S DEAD!! FOLLOWING POLICE OPERATION: MENTALLY ILL MAN DIES Fuck, dude. That's too high. Seriously? That was your idea. Hey, what's up? That psycho got what he deserved. What do you mean? He's dead. I really wanna help you, but I just don't know how. -I don't need help, Nicky. -Yeah, you keep saying that. Look at yourself! You're so naive, Nicky. That's part of our job. Gotta suck it up! You'll learn that soon enough. I hope not. I'm good, okay? All right? Yeah, you're doing great. Wonderful. Everything's fantastic. Come on, just leave me alone. Wait, I can't do it like that. Don't stress yourself. Shh yourself! Just wait a second. Cut that shit out. You kidding me? Cut that shit out! Cut it out! Dude, you're hurting me! Cut it out. For Dad on Father's Day. Kiddo. Kiddo! We're starting. Well. Let's get started. This is the video recording of the reconstruction of the act for case LPDW 2670/17. Captain Konstantin Blago with the Vienna Task Force Alarm Division has the word. Captain, if you please. I was standing in front of the door with the battering ram. Officers Horn and Woschitz covering me. When we arrived, the door was locked from the inside. The door was open actually. I then tried to break down the door with the battering ram. The door then-- First Officer Horn tried to break down the door. So who was it? He didn't manage. It was his first operation. We actually had the situation completely under control until the colleagues from WEGA arrived. Then why did you call us? As backup. When we're called there's imminent danger, but you know that already. So after I broke down the door, it fell into the apartment. The individual was in the corner lying in wait for me and jumped right in my face with a knife. Officer Horn then made use of his firearm in accordance with regulations. Officer? Yes. The individual... was... in the corner with a knife in his hand... and... then he attacked the Captain. Then I... made use of my firearm. We're trained to shoot until the danger has been neutralized. Officer Horn saved my life. He dropped the knife. Excuse me? Malinowski dropped the knife. After the first shot. -That's nonsense. -What? That's nonsense! What's nonsense? It's nonsense that you saw that, because you were standing over there -and couldn't even see into the apartment. -How do you know what I saw? You were standing right there. You couldn't have seen if he dropped the knife. Do you seriously want to insinuate that I'm making a false statement? Kiddo? Kiddo, what's up? Officer? Officer Horn saved my life. He dropped the knife. He didn't manage. Kiddo! Christoph! Christoph! How are you? It's fine. I'm great. Did he really drop the knife? I'll have this souvenir for the rest of my life. I don't care whether or not he dropped the knife. I told you I can't afford high risk patients. I'm really sorry. I don't know what happened in there. You're a nice guy. But you don't have what it takes to become a part of WEGA. Konsti, please. It won't happen again. I've got it under control. It was a one-time thing. Look, I tried everything. Really. But I'm not obligated to you. Konstantin. Come on. Stay here. Let's talk. Konst... Konstantin, please. Another one? One for the road. To Blago! To Blago. The asshole, man. WEGA should be happy to have someone like you. It's a bullshit department. You understand? You know? I'll just join the fire department. I'll light something up for you. Also, the firemen, they get the hot chicks, -not the cops. -Hey, here comes Nicky. -Hi, Nicky! -Hey, baby-- I called you ten times. Why didn't you pick up? Well, I... There's no reception down here. How much has he had to drink? How much has he had to drink? A lot. Come on, let's go home. -You're totally mad at me. -Let's go home, please. Nah, man. I don't wanna leave... I still wanna dance some more Fuck. I'm such an idiot. I'm always running after you. Well, then go looking for another guy! Piss off, Luke. Kiddo, I'm not your enemy. You know what? Just fuck off, dude, okay? Fine. Nicky? I'm sorry. Hello, I'm currently not available. Just leave me a message or send a text. I'll read it, or not. Fuck. Stupid asshole! What did you think would happen? We told you... to open the door! But no. You had to have a knife. What did you need a knife for? And then you stab at him? Piss off. I didn't want any of this. WE'RE SAYING GOODBYE TO OUR BELOVED HUSBAND, FATHER, SON, BROTHER AND FRIEND ON AUGUST 18TH, 2017 AT 2 P.M. AT MEIDLING CEMETERY. Officer! Are you feeling better? Yeah. It's brave of you to come here. You're surprising me time and time again. Oh, yeah? I wanted to have a word with you. About what? About what happened. You're having doubts. It was emergency assistance. It was a negligent homicide. Okay, fine. What should I have done differently? You nothing. But your superior. What do you mean? I pulled the trigger. You have to be extremely careful with people with mental health conditions. He never should have tried to break down Malinowski's door. No, it... Everything was in accordance with protocol. Nonsense. You shot a person because of your superior's love of the chase. It's high time someone does something about him. And you feel called to the task, eh? I'm preparing my report for the public prosecutor and I will state that your superior unnecessarily escalated the situation. How do you wanna prove that? If you add your name to my statement, that makes two of us. Your superior should be off the streets. This stuff has no effect on me anymore. I need something stronger. You don't need something stronger, you need an operation. Are you crazy? No! Konsti, it's not working. Next week is my boys' graduation ceremony, I have to be there. You have to give me something stronger. You tell me every time "just one more week." Now pay attention, you pen pusher! While you're on the golf course on the weekend hitting around your balls, I'm out with my boys cleaning out all the muck, yeah? So give me something stronger! I can do that, but one day you'll be in a wheelchair pissing yourself, understand? I promise you I'll go under the knife after this week, okay? Please. Open the door. What are you doing here? -I said open the door. -Definitely not. Open the... What do you want? I wanna talk to you. No. We're having a party. Hey, I wanna warn you. What do you wanna warn me about? I met the district police officer. She said it was negligent homicide. And that it's your fault. She has no idea what she's talking about, the cunt. She's writing a report to the public prosecutor. And she wants me to support her version. And? What's your plan? I'm not obligated to you, Konsti. And? Why did you wanna join WEGA? WEGA is my family. Dispatch to sector four. Severely injured colleague in your sector. 44 Wiedner Haupt street. The suspect is on the run. Over. Sector four to dispatch. Roger, we're on our way. Code three. Over and out. Police! Anybody here? Hello! We're here! Where? Here! Here! Quick! Shit. -What happened? -Dunno. It all happened so fast. We were called because of some hobos. One of them beat her down. What did he look like? -Hold this. -Yeah. I dunno. He was wearing a ski mask. And combat boots. What kind of combat boots? Like American ones. For the desert. Okay, go outside and wait for the ambulance. Okay. -You got it? -Yeah. What's up? Nothing. What's with the silly look? I'm happy. Awesome boots you got. That was great, Toni. What? That was great. You did great. The district police officer, the fucking cunt, dude. She got what was coming to her. Clean, dude. Clean. Clean! It was you, wasn't it? -Was it you? -Are you kidding me? No. No, dude! Great! Fucking cunt, dude. She wanted to give it to us all. Right? Was it you? Dude. What's up? The cunt is a traitor. She denounced a colleague. That's high treason. Are you retarded? You asshole. I'm covering our backs. If you hadn't fallen apart, none of this would have been necessary. You little psycho, dude. Fuck! Here's your psycho, you wanker. You stupid motherfucker. We both know that Toni's an asshole. But I thought you were better. Hello! Hi. You picked out the best weather for a motorcycle ride. -You coming up? -Yeah. Great. Wanna eat with me? Come on, grab something. Are you still on a diet? No. So... what's up? I don't know if everything's right with WEGA. What do you mean "if everything's right with WEGA"? Well... if everything is as it should be. If the way we do things is right. If you start thinking about that, about how much sense it makes, then you're a danger to yourself, and a danger to your colleagues. I'm not telling you this as your father, I'm telling you as a colleague. Kiddo. Time to grow up. The world is no action movie. Motherfucker. Hey! Hello! Leo! Leo! Heinz knows me. My favorite customer. What's he got here? A Bengal light. Pyrotechnics. -Is this really necessary? Honestly. -It is, Leo. What must be, must be. -You got some sweets for me as well? -No, I don't. Nothing? Then we're done here. Thank you. -But I get that back afterward, Heinz. -No, Leo, you're not getting it back. I'm telling you. Things have already calmed down. Everything's fine again. They're amicable again. He's amicable again. -We're still fetching him out. -Why? Honestly. What do you want, you wussy? Get out of the way! We're getting him out. Why? Everything's already calmed down. You two wussies. Guys, you don't need to go in there. Everything's fine. Get him out now! Step aside! That wasn't too smart. Defend yourself! You still in your right mind. My dad... had everything under control... until you sent us in. Your dad? Your dad is a danger to us all with his do-gooder naiveté. Yeah, right. You're the danger, Konsti. I'm no danger. I'm a police officer. Because of you I had to shoot Malinowski. And beat down random people for no reason. And Toni beat a colleague into a coma. A colleague, you understand? And all of it just because we needed to be heroes for you. You get it now? Toni, come here. Come here now! Kiddo says you beat the district police officer into a coma. Is that true? I did what needed to be done. A colleague? Are you insane? You idiot! I saved our asses. I saved all of our asses. For you, Konsti. Bye. I'll be there in a minute. -You sure? -Yeah. -What happened? -Hi Nicky. It's nothing. It's all right. What's up? I wanna apologize. For what? For being an ass... For treating you badly and being aggressive. I'm sorry. You deserve better. Wanna go for a drink some time? No. It's not a good time. But thank you for apologizing. It's important to me. Thanks. Dispatch to sector five. What's your status? Over. Sector five to dispatch. Status one. Over. Roger. We've got a noise disturbance request for you. At 5 Leopold-Rister-Gasse street. The party is apparently aggressive. Over. Sector five, roger. Status three. Thanks. All right, let's go. Do we need the battering ram? No. We'll take a look first. Come on! I don't know what to do with this woman... The music is so loud. Everyday loud music like in a club. It ruins every day. Like a loud... Hey, Nicky. Hello. What's going on here? You can hear it for yourself. The caretaker says that the party attacked her. Did she attack you? The woman is psycho. All day loud music. She thinks she's in a club every day! Do you have a second key to her apartment? No, I don't. You don't. -Now do we need the battering ram? -No, we don't need the battering ram. Where's the fuse box for the apartment? Right here. -Can you please open it? -Yes. Thanks. So... -I'll help you. -Here? I'll help, I'll take a look. Seventy eight. Seventy eight. What's the woman's name? Rahel. Police! Please, open the door! We know you're home. Piss off! Would you please be so kind as to open the door? Piss off! Nicky, please, come in. Here Nicky. Over. I see a woman with a kid on the 13th floor. I'm worried she'll jump. Shit, Martin, battering ram quickly! Let's go! Get away from the door. Fuck. Fuck. Rahel? Please, don't do anything stupid, okay? Step away from the window! Rahel, can you hear me? Rahel, can you hear us? Can you hear us? Fuck. Where's that guy with the battering ram? Rahel, please answer us! Stay calm. Stay calm. Stay calm, Rahel. I'm coming in now, okay? Coming in. I'm coming in now. I'm Chris. Piss off! This is my colleague Nicky. Get lost. Stay calm. Stay calm. Hello there. I also used to have a cat. His name was Baloo. Do you know him? From "The Jungle Book?" That fat bear. Look, give me your baby, and then you come down and we'll talk, all right? Give me your baby. Come here. Everything's all right. Well, hello. Everything's fine. Hello. Everything's all right. Your baby needs you. Give me your hand. What is she supposed to do without you? No!
