To free climb: Climbing only on the rock's natural structures, without using artificial aids. Yesterday, I had a dream. I was in a climbing gym somewhere, a run-down gym, totally shabby. Some climber walks in wearing crampons and a helmet. Behind him I can see a snowstorm raging. I think, "I'd love to climb the Torre now, too!" So I open the door, get crampons, an ice axe and stuff, and suddenly I'm right in the middle of the Ice Towers. It was so weird! Cool dream. Weird. It all began with the dream to take part in an expedition outside Europe. From that moment on the dream became a nightmare. A heavy snowstorm had frozen the wall. My foot slipped. I tried to hang on with my right hand, but that slipped too. As I was slipping, I managed to grab hold with my left hand. That was the most dangerous moment, because I nearly fell off the mountain. Every story about Cerro Torre begins with the mystery shrouding its first ascent -- a secret known only to Cesare Maestri and Toni Egger. If I could, I'd go back and delete the mountain from my life. There is question as to whether Maestri had actually done his route in 1959 with Toni Egger. Toni Egger is dead. There's no witnesses, no pictures... ...and only his story. The alleged ascent with Toni Egger, if it actually took place, would be the greatest ascent of this mountain ever. Cesare Maestri will go down in the history of mountaineering but also in the history of question marks. Was he really up there? Was he really the first to climb Cerro Torre or not? If someone says they have done something, then you take everything on trust. But, unfortunately, there are always the black sheep. There was doubt about our first expedition. We didn't want to leave any uncertainty, so we went back. If Maestri wants to save face, he'll have to attack the Torre one more time. I don't think anywhere in the world is there a mountain anything like it. It is unique. It is everything you would dream of wanting. And as a sort of last challenge, as a most inaccessible point, it should be unclimbed. He returns to the mountain with 1.500 pounds of equipment. The centerpiece of his new strategy is a massive piece of machinery -- a 180-pound gas-powered compressor designed to drive a heavy-duty power drill. Maestri will perforate the Torre's raw granite walls with metal bolts. This time around, he will leave nothing to chance. Most heroes, when you actually meet them, are not as heroic as one might imagine. The public love heroes, but, sure, there are a few, but not many. You want to do the first free ascent of the 1970 Maestri route. Reinhold Messner at International Mountain Summit You don't need a film crew or a camera. Just do it, and if you succeed, you succeed. This film that could come out in two to three years is going to be totally different on the big screen from what you're doing now. We won't see you go there and fail, adding bolts to mount cameras, the helicopter flying in and out. In the film we'll see you start at the bottom and finish on the summit. Fantastic! We all applaud that, but it has nothing to do with reality. We did it! Yeah! Don't you think that the film crew or the guys from Red Bull are taking advantage of you on Cerro Torre?

He could be at the very top of his sport for many, many years to come. The question I asked myself is: can I climb on the Cerro Torre like I do in competition? In 2009 David Lama announced he would ascend Cerro Torre via the Compressor Route -- Climbing using only the rock's natural structures, and using bolts and ropes solely for protection should he fall. This is called free climbing. Many people say it's impossible to free climb up there. Maybe it's not possible for them, but for me it is. You will not climb the Cerro Torre free -- period. Jim Bridwell 2nd ascent of the Compressor Route Done. I've been there a number of times. It's a challenging place to climb. We imagined it would be different, a lot easier than it really was. Quick, mark it! - Clapperboard... - Mark it! - Mark it. - Use your hands. Damn, my feet are freezing! Conditions are bad, seemingly nothing uncommon in Patagonia. David and Daniel leave some gear at the base camp and leave the valley as quick as possible. Seven hours later they are back at the El Chaltén. I puked all night. No sleep. Puking and shitting. We're staying here. Daniel feels like shit. There's no point in going up today. You only have a few days' window when climbing is possible, and you have to make certain that you are in a position to use those few days to best advantage. I'm recording. - No? - Yeah, ready to go. Thomy Dirnhofer Director Let's lift off. Me and my crew -- we can make use of the favorable conditions. Markus Pucher and two guides prepare the Torre for filming. But knowing the history of the mountain, we should have done things differently. In the winter of 1970, Maestri drilled some 300 holes, along the southeastern ridge for rope ladders. Rather than repeat his fated route with Toni Egger on the north face, he ignores Torre's natural rock structure, and now chooses a straight line to the top. During your first ascent in 1959 there was no photographic documentation. Do you have any now? The main documentation is the 70-kilo compressor that remains just below the summit as an eternal testimony to the ascent we accomplished. This time no one can dispute Maestri's great sporting achievement. This ascent of the impossible mountain would later go down in the books as the Compressor Route. To this day, the 180-pound compressor hangs only a rope's length beneath the summit of Cerro Torre. To make sure that everybody realized that I had been on the compressor, I broke the pressure-release valve off the thing, put it in my pocket, hoping I could make it down alive. Alongside Maestri's bolt ladder, we drill a new set of holes to enable the filming David's free ascent on the Compressor Route. We are here to film -- The end justifies the means. In a way, that is why I found it so upsetting that, you know, that man has imposed his will on it by drilling his way to the top. Daniel is up and running again, and the weather looks good. We head back in. This time, we leave base camp behind us and climb straight up to the Col de la Paciencia -- the col of patience. - Hey, you know what would be cool now? - What? - Kaiserschmarrn pancakes! Kaiserschmarrn? I can think of lots of cool stuff right now. Yes, I think it'll work out tomorrow. So we can get up there on the summit. - Good night, David. - Night. Good night, Daniel. Is that the Banana Crack? No idea. Shall we get the map out? Our first attempt just didn't go well. I had to pull Daniel up. Then I had the camera in my face all the time. It's always there, it's irritating. So, how's it going, David? Ask me again when I get down. Right now I'm pissed off. It's too hot now. I have to get down. We have to get down now. The ice is coming down all the time. Yeah... this is pretty crap. Nothing went right. We only got to the Bolt Traverse. Just when the climbing started to get interesting, we had to turn back. It's doubtful whether we can make it up this year. The walls are so iced up that our chances aren't good. And once in the other direction. Quick! When the weather isn't right, you're just vegetating. It hasn't been right for a month and a half, so that's how long we've been killing time down here. You drift on a raft, but you don't paddle. Come on, let's have a barbecue. This song tells the story of the ascent of Cerro Torre... Toni Ponholzer 13th season in Patagonia up to where it is today. The ascent of the original route is still a mystery today. We came here over the vast sea To the fight for the peaks of the world And the climbers move there With their gear To the goal that we set ourselves Wild guanacos go with us Across the Pampas' lonely heights And from afar we can see The Cerro Torre's distant peak This is the most dangerous place I think I've ever climbed. Mountain of our desires... Suddenly that climbing gym dude wants to climb Cerro Torre. One day you'll be ours! If the conditions are right I can climb it really fast. You will not climb the Cerro Torre free. ¿Qué hora es? What time is it? Time is up... Game over. David Lama will not climb the Compressor Route free, and we have rigged the mountain for a film shoot that never got under way. Dirni thought he could shoot the film in six weeks and head back home with a complete film. But it doesn't work like that. Instead of a historical alpine adventure, we bring back home a shit storm of epic proportions. The things said on the Internet were a justified attack on me as a climber. DAVID, YOU RIDICULOUS CLOWN. I went to Patagonia all full of myself, saying I could free climb the world's hardest mountain just like that. But if I hadn't been down there, no film crew would have been there and no bolts would've been placed. In the end I was the moron with the power drill, just like the one 40 years ago. The first year I went down with Daniel, a good friend of mine. But then I realized I need a top alpinist at my side. So I just called Peter. I answered the phone and David said, "Got time for a project, Peter?" "Yeah, where?" "In the Tre Cime." "Cool, that's real close. What are you planning?" "Bellavista." And I said, "An awesome project. I really want to be on board." ♪ The biggest dreams must die ♪ ♪ Whenever they will come alive ♪ What I appreciate about Peter when we're out climbing is not having to say much, and he doesn't say things like: "Look, there's a chamois." I don't give a shit about chamois. We both live to climb, and we get on really well. It worked well so I asked him to come with me to Patagonia the following year. So we're going back again. But this time we agreed beforehand not to place any new bolts and not to fix ropes. The plan is that the film crew will aid climb on Maestri's bolts like any other climbing party. Base camp It's fogged up, the stupid thing. - Better now? - Yeah, it's okay. That's good. Who cares! Tomorrow we're going up. I think it'll be okay for two days. A two-day weather window can't just disappear within 12 hours. That just won't happen. The route I'd always planned goes from the Col de la Paciencia along the southeast ridge to the summit. At first it's easy, past the Banana Crack to the start of the Bolt Traverse. And where Maestri's bolt ladder turns away to the right, my free climb goes to the left up the ridge, into the Ice Towers, and up to the base of the Headwall. From the compressor, where Bridwell aid climbed straight up, I'll have to find enough structures to free climb it. Everything's good for a moment, and it can change real fast. Puffy cloud out over the Yellow Continental. 15 minutes later, the whole sky is slate gray and it's blowing 80 miles an hour. David for Markus. Over. Down at base camp we'd received a new weather report. Markus Pucher film crew alpine guide But we couldn't reach the guys up on the Col. It's ten past two in the morning, David. I wonder what the conditions will be like today. For goodness' sake! Pull on blue, please. Okay. This really sucks! Is it worth it? No, man... Am I nuts? - At least you feel the same as me! - This is brutal. Awful conditions. Look at it. Incredible! All the forces of nature are present and evident and working against you. Overnight, the weather has changed. Now the whole upper section is covered with ice and is unclimbable. The rest of the mountain hides behind a thick curtain of fog. We circle around the Torre several times, without a trace of David and Peter. Okay, Peter! This is shit! All the cracks were icy. And the ice kept coming loose when the sun came out. I did know that to finish the project I'd have to go beyond my limits. But at the start I wasn't aware how far beyond I'd have to go. Look how much ice there is. That's really terrible. There's too much of that stuff hanging overhead. We've no chance of reaching the summit. Yeah. Ten meters higher than last year. First ten meters further, then ten meters below. And now in between. It's a good start at least. - Once we were 100 meters short. - Yeah. - It's okay. At least we know we're really going for it this year. Because we have a few tons of ice above us. There's so much of it. Nobody knows how well the ice actually holds. New year, new partner, same old story -- turning around at the Bolt Traverse. Every pitch sucked. - Every single one. - Even the easiest. - Yeah. If you come down here for a month and a half just to do the Torre, it'd drive everybody nuts. That's just the way it is. Of all Patagonian summits, the Cerro Torre is the one most exposed to the weather. It always takes a few days for the ice to clear out again. TUESDAY El Chaltén Yeah, it's really shit again. It's really rough down here. We've been here 20 days... Three weeks. And still nothing. We'd need a really good weather window. - No point in going up there again. - None at all. We know that way by now. I know it better than the classics back home. Maybe we can do something else for the next two days. What I really didn't want was to hang around the village and watch all the others climb whichever peaks, while we wait despairingly for the weather to be right for the Torre. WEDNESDAY on the way to base camp So we used a two-day weather window to try the Poincenot. THURSDAY summit Poincenot 3002m So how long have we been gone? Half past 12... - 22 and a half? - Yeah. - Give or take. 22 and a half hours. I'm so happy right now! Just sitting here. And then we went for a drink or two. THURSDAY El Chaltén FRIDAY El Chaltén Good morning. It's time to get up and go to work! No. Yes, right. How did I get here? Bouldering mat? I'm in David's bed! - I tied you to the bed, Peter. - I'm tied up? Am I crazy? What's the weather like, Peter? Awesome weather. - Really awesome. - You fell out of bed last night. Really? Then you were lying on the edge, so I thought I'd better tie you down. - Bullshit. - No shit! Pure bullshit. Get up, man! I brought you the weather report. Wanna have a look? This is the window that we climbed in, but it's too late to head out now. It's too late now. This is really shit, us being stuck in El Chaltén. Yeah. Go climb something, locos! - We have to get going now. - Yep. Let's go! David and Peter now have little time left. Maybe the last chance FRIDAY to reach the summit this year. SATURDAY The film team stays behind. We have the helicopter and the climbers have their two cameras. Hanging just below the compressor, I got confused, because I was a meter away, and I thought, "What's happening now?" Couldn't get any rope from below. Oh, god. I know what happened. Out of rope. They did two pitches at once, and now they're out of rope. Now Peter got to start climbing. It's strange when you have no anchor above or below. - You know if someone falls... - Falling's not an option. - No. With that ice thing over there, you have to get a hold on the right so the ice is between your feet. You know if any part breaks off, it'll hit your partner head on. Climbing the Bridwell pitch from the compressor onwards, that was really cool. We said, "Who's gonna climb the Bridwell?" And you said, "Climb it." I have enough fuel for two more hours, but at some point we'll run out of light. Okay, good. We'll... I reckon we'll reach the summit in 30 to 45 minutes. - Okay, guys. - How we looking? I think we're going to make it. BRIDWELL PITCH final pitch below the summit I think our question up here is, can they do it in 15 minutes? It will take 35 minutes till both are on the ice. - We're screwed. - Why? Well, because I don't think Pablo will fly that late. It's getting cold. But we'll manage. Peter is now four meters from the summit plateau. But everything is covered with ice. And now we're screwed again. But I don't think we're giving up now. You bastard! I called the mountain all kinds of names. - You can't turn back four meters from the summit. - No. There's no turning back up there. It'd make you sick for the rest of your life. Where are the guys, Tom? They're now at the top of the Headwall. I have five minutes flying time left. At the compressor I put on the crampons, so I could run across the last snowfield. And I sprinted up there. I was so exhausted on the plateau. I had an aider hanging out on the left, and on the summit plateau I thought, "Should I put it away? No, keep going!

Give the Torre my regards, and when you rappel down, stay awake, alright? Yeah, will do. Good night. Ciao! All the best. Take care! I think in the first two years the Torre wore me down so badly that when I stood on top at the end of the second year I really didn't care if I'd free climbed my way up or pulled myself up on the bolts, because it was the first time I realized how hard it is to reach the summit at all. I think that was the moment when I stopped being a sport climber and became an alpinist. SATURDAY rappelling Compressor Route SUNDAY rappelling Compressor Route Watch out for the end of the rope! I can't see a thing. The moment of truth comes when you start to pull the rope, to pull the rappel. That's why I always carry, like, a 200-foot, 7-millimeter rope in the bottom of my pack. Gives you that maybe good extra chance. You lost the rope, you lost your life. I grew up as a sport climber and as such the first thing you learn is: Never put your finger in a bolt. If you fall, it'll be cut off. Just as I never questioned that rule, I never questioned the rules of climbing competitions, which for years ruled my life in a way. And so the first time that I stood on top of the Torre, I also realized for the very first time that I wasn't in a gym anymore and the Torre isn't a competition venue with 1000 spectators, and a referee with a stopwatch. There's no one watching you. You're on your own, at best with your partner. Therefore there are no rules, and it's your attitude that's decisive. Climbing is, to me, is adventure, excitement. The one thing lacking from civilization. Bad thing. - Fred! - What? I need some copper heads and the copper-head pounder. That's me. And it's in French, which I don't really speak. But this means "genius." This means "fool" or "crazy" or "mad." So it means "The Crazy Genius of Rock-Climbing," or "climbing." Grimpeur. And this just says "legend." "Jim Bridwell."

MONDAY El Chaltén Hey, Peter! I think we've got it. What did he say? Charly said, on the 19th. The 19th is Thursday. Today's the 15th. So this is the actual Headwall. Here, I'll leave the Compressor Route. This is the same as the Bridwell. And then I'll climb to up here. And the Bridwell is here? - Bridwell -- you can actually see a rope here. -Yeah. - This is like 5 to 10 meters. - Okay. - I might have to place a bolt here. - Yeah. And then climb this section, 'cause this might be hard. - And -- yeah. If these are loose. - And especially if this one's iced up, then it's getting really nasty, and you don't want to take a 20-meter fall out there. From the top of Cerro Torre. - So you're going up there the day after tomorrow? - Right. - And you go up tomorrow? - We go up tomorrow, and the day after that we could already get to the shoulder. My job is to shoot climbing footage of David and Peter, and I had a number of questions, Lincoln Else cameraman & rock climber like I do for any climbing job. Lincoln Else cameraman & rock climber And one of the most important questions was "Well, who would I be climbing with?" Cerro Torre TONI EGGER MEMORIAL CHAPEL El Chaltén One day you'll be ours! TONI EGGER MEMORIAL CHAPEL El Chaltén When I broke my foot one day Toni Ponholzer now filmteam member my father taught me all three chords I know. He's as sort of quintessential badass Patagonian climber as you can be. I'd spent some time in the Bridwell camp. We were sitting by the huts and lying around in the sun, you know? Rice, pasta, potatoes... It was the same every day! We hadn't had meat for ages. So we thought, "We could eat these mice. They live off grass and healthy stuff." So we gutted them like a butcher would. Then we salted them and threw them into the frying pan. Six mice, very tender, very nice! Someone called, I didn't recognize the number so I picked up. I called up Markus... "Are you Markus?" "Yeah, sure, but which Toni are you?" I was looking for a partner for Cerro Torre's north face. It's obvious why. Who is going? I showed him some photographs and he got excited. This is Toni Egger's route. Straight up Cerro Torre's north face. Everybody knows Toni Ponholzer. He's been going to Cerro Torre for years. He's a real Cerro Torre veteran. With Toni there are three of us now. Lincoln Else, Toni Ponholzer and me. What drives me to climb the north face is that I keep thinking of Toni Egger. He's no longer alive. He can no longer tell the world if he got to the summit or not. I want to take his route, and either finish it for him or repeat it, so there's finally someone who can speak up for him, "The route can be climbed. Let me find my peace!" The container isn't big. It has four beds, a bathroom in the back and a common room with a kitchen. How gross! Two or three flies, huh! - Peter, let's set a new world record. - You can live quite well. Real luxury for a mountaineer. No more tent. You have a container, which sounds kind of strange, but that's a luxury for us. Okay, that's it. Having a dry room with electricity and hot water where you can stay... It's simple, but it's okay. TUESDAY El Chaltén It's hard waiting down here. You bet. There's nothing before Wednesday? No. No, I really don't think it'd be smart to... - Do anything before then. - To do anything before then. Don't you think? Rationally speaking? It just sucks that the weather's great for mountaineering. Not perfect for the Torre in fact, but great for mountaineering. We'll do the Torre on the 21st, Exupery on the 22nd and Fitz on the 23rd. We'd better do something at all. We've had a good week of reasonable weather. That's what's so crap, that really pisses me off. I'm really sorry, but we came here for the Torre. Welcome back. This is "National Geographic Weekend." I'm Boyd Matson. Usually, when someone does a first in mountaineering, is the first to stand on top of a famous peak, they get all the talk. All the conversation is about the climb up. But here's a story that's gotten almost as much attention for what happened on the way down. Hayden Kennedy & Jason Kruk back in base camp Pretty much climbed the start of the Compressor Route. Well, how I would describe it is that we just wanted to -- I just wanted to ignore the line that Maestri climbed. I remember sitting in silence up there. And then I remember Jason just kind of being like, "So, what about those bolts?" Hayden and I managed to remove the bolts off the entire Headwall. So we cleaned about 125 bolts. But there's still over 200 left there. So there's a lot more work to be done. We just used our ice axes and levered them out. This is just a huge chapter in history. And you were going to write it, no? The ultimate goal is to respect the mountain. I will call the police. Yeah, that's right. There was a mob. The question remains, did Maestri curse the mountain? Put a Macumba spell on it? We sent a unit round right away. I think we're both surprised that -- a lot of people who know us are surprised that we'd do something like this. But it's just because, you know, we really believed in it. I guess the main reason why we chopped the bolts is to give the mountain the respect that it deserves and to set an example that it is a really hard mountain to climb. To chop the Compressor Route -- it has created one of the great firestorms on the Internet that I've ever been privy to. You just decided to take it upon yourselves to clean the mountain and make it back to the challenge it was, and that's where the controversy begins. Those bolts don't make the adventure. Luis Pablo Soto jun. Permanent resident What makes the adventure is yourself. You have to know how to put your mistakes aside and choose another way. WEDNESDAY El Chaltén David? - I'm afraid we have to wake you up. - Because? - We have some news. - Which is... Here's what happened. Markus Pucher gave me a call. A Canadian climbing team came down, and apparently they aid climbed the Compressor Route - but without using Maestri's bolts. - Yeah. And... they removed all Maestri bolts in the Headwall. Who cares? No, I really don't care. Then I won't use them either. - Why did they do that? - They thought they had to. Just like I think I have to free climb the Compressor Route, basically. What David doesn't consider, without the help of Maestri's bolts, there is no way for the film team to cover his climb on the Headwall... Good morning, gentlemen. ...Except... You have the west face, and you have a little ramp here going down to the glacier. - Yeah. - But then we will scout a spot where we can drop these guys on the ground. The film crew's new plan is to choose a different route -- The line of the Torre's uncontested first ascent in 1974. It was Casimiro Ferrari who discovered the Torre's true soft spot -- the iced-up west face. The Ragni di Lecco expedition went down in history for making the first ascent of Cerro Torre via the west face. Okay, let's go home. Okay, let's go. Perfect. Sitting in the helicopter, boom, boom, boom, boom. Because you know tomorrow you climb up there. - Yes. - You know? And Markus Pucher is just the right guy to lead the film team safely to the top within 48 hours. It'll be amazing if we succeed, and both teams get to the summit. We'll meet on top and film the guys. We'll go up on Friday past the Bolt Traverse. - Yeah? - We'll bivouac there - and go up on Saturday. - Okay, good. We'll go up from the back on Friday and bivy up there. We'll show them, they think we aren't doing anything. - Really? - You bet. So that's the plan. But one thing that I've learned here in Patagonia is that whatever plan you make is gonna change. So we'll see how things go. Your rope... good. Ice screws... THURSDAY El Chaltén We'll leave some stuff behind, so we're a bit lighter. Hey, the weather is so cool. So this is it. What we've been waiting for for three years. It's so cool. I can hardly believe it. - Markus. - David? - See you up there. - See you up there. Okay, Markus, - have fun on the west side. - You too. I'll think of you as I ax my way up through the ice. - West face, east face, right? - Exactly. - Great. Cool. - Okay, ciao. - Ciao. - We've never seen the mountain like that. - With so little ice? No. The Headwall is so clean. Okay, David, let's do it! You bet. Alright. - Fingers crossed. - If you ever let us go. It's your turn now. It's all yours! Once Peter and I had crossed the hanging bridge and set off towards the Torre, we knew this was our chance, one we had to take, one we wouldn't get again for the next five years. What is your plan for the mushrooms? - Do we need wings or anything, or no? - No. No, no, no. - 'Cause it's all -- - Yeah. I haven't climbed down here before, so it's humbling to get to climb in Patagonia for anyone, especially someone who's gonna come down here and then try to go up on Cerro Torre. BASE CAMP - Right now it's... - Three hours. - Quarter to ten. No, quarter to eleven. A three hour break. - I'll put my gloves on tomorrow morning. - Really? - Yeah. - For the start. - Not me. - It's good to start with. - No, I don't like it. - I do. - No. Like an old married couple! We came up really quickly today. FRIDAY before sunrise Yes, it went really great. FRIDAY before sunrise It didn't take us more than 90 minutes. - No, it didn't. - Probably less. Now we'll put on all the gear and on we go! Now we twiddle our thumbs. We have to wait for six hours to stay on schedule. We were way too quick. 4.5 hours to the shoulder is great. The helicopter drops off the film team behind the Torre, at the foot of the west face. It looks tough. It's challenging, steep, covered with ice and mixed terrain in between. If you're not familiar with it, if you're a rock climber, then it's very daunting. We actually set off with a camera man who knew nothing about ice climbing. We had to figure out whether to use the American climbing terms or the German climbing terms, and I think we ended up with sort of a hybrid of both of them. Toni, how goes it? Oh, it goes good. Meanwhile, David and Peter have reached the Bolt Traverse under prime conditions. You want an extra-romantic panorama pan? An incredible panorama pan. - I'll start with you, okay? - Okay. But then in this direction, so you can see Loch Ness. - Alright. - Okay. Ooooh. This is so beautiful. Here is Fitz Roy and Poincenot. And Little Raphael. And over there is Loch Ness. The Bolt Traverse. The first pitch that no one's free climbed yet, right? - Till now. - Yeah. That'll have changed in 30 minutes. Let's hope so. The first chalk on the Torre. - Okay, Peter? - Okay. The first pitch on the Bolt Traverse is extremely difficult. You have to keep your weight over your feet. You stand on very small footholds and you have really bad holds for the hands. That makes it all really difficult. You have to climb very precisely. Terrific, David. - How's it going? - Good! While on the Bolt Traverse, climbing around the edge, I looked up. I saw this thin crack. From the way it ran up, becoming so narrow you couldn't even get your fingers in, it became clear to me I would really have to dig deep. It's pretty difficult here. Okay. David climbed really well until he got to the difficult bit. I could see it would get even tougher, but he didn't say anything. But you could see from his moves that this was a major challenge. Come on. I got you. It's okay! Damn tough here! Afterwards I thought, "I don't really get the feeling this is possible." It's no use. Let me down, Peter. Okay. You only get the chance to free climb the Torre about every five years, because the weather's rarely right. You can't keep messing about trying to free climb one pitch. You have to get through it quickly. You have to have faith, not hope. Faith that there's something beyond you. Hope is delusional. I can imagine that the crucial point is the variation of the Bolt Traverse, not, as others say, up in the Headwall. Okay, let's have a look at the west face. When we get to there, to this last 50 meters, I stay there and I was thinking, "shit." The last stretch was a vertical wall. There was water running down, ice falling off... Markus and I looked at it... Jesus! How are we ever going to get up there? If you want to free climb the Torre, you must go at it with all guns blazing. Okay, Peter. That's it, David! Keep going. Keep going! Come on. It's okay, David! Sock it to him! Keep going! - Yeah, terrific! - Yes! Yes, cool! I'll go round to the anchor, okay? Hello, Markus, what's your plan? How's it going with you? It's going well. We're at the first ice mushroom. We're going up there now. I got to the top. I was all alone. The two guys were still down below. I saw the sun go down, and my eyes welled up. It was incredible. There's nothing you can do. You're up there, and suddenly it just moves you to tears. It's amazing. Peter, David, if you can hear me, we'll make one more approach then fly home. See you tomorrow with the latest weather report. Guys, have a great night and, yeah, have a blast! Now we're ready for the night. In our sleeping bags, a nice sitting bivy. Enjoying the sunset. The place where they bivouacked looked really uncomfortable. I kept thinking of them. I'm sure it was a rough night. film crew arriving at summit plateau I was thinking back over the last 20 years I've been here in Patagonia. I thought, "Okay, I didn't come up the north face, but I really am where I wanted to be." Here I have a flag. Of? Of Toni Egger. Yes. Remember Toni Egger? I always carry with me. Yeah, yeah. Cool. Yeah. - It's good, huh? - Uh-huh. Perfect. It's really great. This is the only flag I have. SATURDAY 21st of January 2012 Now we go in. Now we go in on the bivouac. The bivvy they had. You see the bivvy? Are they still in bed? I can see where they had a piss -- yellow snow. Certainly, you're gonna come to those situations of choice where you better know yourself or you're gonna die. When you're pushed to your limits, it's more likely to stay in your memory than if you go jogging on a treadmill somewhere every day. Then you can't just pick a moment from your life and say, "Wow! I really pushed myself to the limit." It's all loose flakes and loose blocks, and... you can't afford to make a mistake. The rock quality is not too good. - Really? - Yeah. - Well, is it crumbling? - Yeah. It looks pretty loose to me. Hey, what's that over to your left? I don't know. That's something else. - Now we're up at the compressor. - There it is, two or three meters away. There it hangs. - Just one more pitch. Thirty meters. - Not bad. Then we've redpointed the Torre. Hundreds of people have climbed up the bolt ladder, but the route should be done as a free climb. The difficulty is just phenomenal. It's there to be climbed. You know, I'm sure you can do it. I'm sure it will be. Okay, gentlemen. Now, the next pitch is the big question. This is going to be tough, Peter. Okay. These flakes are unstable. They're loose and hollow. You never know, if you fall off with one, it might pull out the next one and the next one. It could hit you from above or cut the rope or whatever. I think Peter saw the long runouts between the placements there were, and he could well have been scared. He has to decide. It's first terrain. New terrain, so he doesn't know where to -- I cannot tell you. When I was 5 meters from the summit snow-field, not knowing whether to go left across the slabs or right onto the loose block, and I felt how terribly wobbly it was, that's when I thought, "OK, you just have to hold now." Yeah, we're keeping -- we're eyeballing him, but we do another turn. We're waiting. Don't worry about the skids. In case he's falling, I got it, at least. Yes, Peter! Yes, sir! Without placing one single bolt. David, you're an animal! Yes, baby. Yes. Oh, that feels good. You only want to have climbed something like that once in your life. Cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. That's all. - Thanks, Peter. - Terrific, David. I believe that the skills I brought from competition were the final building block in free climbing the Torre. Hey, guys! During my first two years I lacked the alpine basis that I needed in order to put the final building block in place. I'm really happy for you, guys. Yeah! We're still going up there, right? The reason I chose the Torre was that I was looking for something where I could learn, and where... I could get involved in something I wasn't part of at first, where I could learn a lot and discover so much about myself. It was cool standing up there with Toni, Markus and Lincoln. They're really cool guys. Standing up there with such cool guys isn't something you can take for granted. It's really cool, the five of us standing up there. But it wouldn't have mattered if there had been ten of us. Everyone had given their all to be up there. And everyone shared the same joy. Actually that's the summit. I gotta do this now. I think everyone wants to try and do their best and maybe set new standards. But what it's all about is what you experience as you try. One generation thinks, "Oh, it's all done." Then the next generation finds something new. I survived. All we had to do was get down to tell the tale, and we did. - What a cool mountain to ski down! - Just what I thought while climbing up. Okay, Peter. I'm going down here! Right, David, have fun. Anybody that knows me knows that story's not true, 'cause I wouldn't waste a dog, throwing it over the edge. I'd eat it. Keep on shooting, I'm not that picky. - In the edit... - You throw it away. And snow! Hit Toni with the snow! And more! Even more! Yeah, right! And some fog! - And cut! - Dirnhofer, piss off! Then this really big chunk hits his head. "Oh, ow. My head!" Ice screw -- bam -- hit me right in the face. He had a tear in his lip this size. So I say to him... "Oh, it's not so bad. It looks good." Hey, guys, are you ready for another day in wonderful Patagonia? First you do your stuff, then we'll climb the north face! It's quite a steep pitch. - But you climbed it, right? - Sure we did! Or did you go up in the chopper? - No, we went up from the glacier. - I see! What did you think? You only go up in a chopper now? From the age of 50, yeah. Chopper and jet plane. And I only allow myself one frame per day. So it really means contemplating, when am I actually going to depress that shutter? That means I'm not using that motor drive or the ability to just fill cards and thousands of pictures. It means Red Bull pays me for 10 days. They get 10 pictures. "Oh, my god. The bolts are gone." And I was just like, "Really? But..." No, we don't really have a special climbing style. We just go for it. Full throttle. That's our style.
