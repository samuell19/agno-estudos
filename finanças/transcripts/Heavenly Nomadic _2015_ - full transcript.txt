I see the moon in its new shape. And I see plenty of ears of corn blessed by the light of the moon and the earth. Give the orphans enough to eat. Let the travelers move forward. Let the lazy get zealous. Reward the hardworking. Agree the stingy ones graciously. Bless us from moon to moon, from year to year. Amen. Please stop here. I have forgiven you I have forgiven you I have forgiven you NOMADS OF THE SKY May God grant your wishes. Stay healthy! What are you lying there grinning? Shah up. When I was your age I lit the stove. And fetched water alone. And you can't do anything but grin. Stand up! Au, my cross! Bloody age. Go now Get at least half a bucket of water! Stand up! Get at least half a bucket of water! What are you lying there grinning? How are you, Shaiyr? Gut. Can I help you? Well, like. I've told you many times contact with Ermek brings no good. What kind of job is it anyway, measuring the weather? That's a drift! The weather God sends us will come. But you can take poison on it, he takes our daughter-in-law away from us. And you sent our only grandson to study. He'll know one chick and never come back. Drive the foal back. Stand still, you wretched beast! I'm just missing that for you to perk up. What would I do without you, my darling? Here, this foal will one day be yours. Good morning, Karachach Apa! How are you? I'm fine dear Be welcome. Good afternoon, Tabyldy Ata! Howdy my son Are you sure you're coming for the milk? - How are you, Umsunai? - Good. -Good? I'm going down to town. Do you need anything? Our grandson wanted to come home for the holidays. If he's free, please bring him with you. Agreed. Umsunai, what should I bring you? Me? - I want an ice cream. - An ice cream? Deal. Thank you very much. Grandfather? Grandfather! Who was it, that you bowed to last night? - In front of a bird called "Sütak". - Sutak? Come on, I'll tell you the legend of the bird. A long long time ago, when all people trusted the shamans, an old shaman lived in this area, with her son and her daughter-in-law. One evening saw the shaman like her daughter-in-law chatting to a stranger with a smile. The old woman got angry and cursed her: "You shall turn yourself into a bird forever!" Since then she has lived in secrecy and only comes out in the dark: "Sütak, Sütak," she sings. Your "Sütak" is called: "I'm as pure as milk." When you hear Sütak sing put out a bowl of milk and bows three times to forgive her. Why did the old woman curse her? They just stood together. In those days it was a sin to stand next to someone my Sunshine. Come here, my child! I'm going to see the cattle. My child, should I tell you another fairy tale? Come here. Once upon a time there was a nomadic tribe who wandered about between the high Kyrgyz mountains. In this tribe also lived Koruke, a well known hunter. Koruke fed on his prey his whole family and its village communities. One day he was on his way home from arm efidgbsen hunting. Then he met a mountain goat, trapped between some rocks. Koruke was delighted to set his sights on the goat, but suddenly he heard her speaking to him in a human voice: "Koruke, do not kill me! I am not an ordinary goat, but the ancestor of all mountain goats, I am a Kaiberen. If you kill me becomes misery come upon your people. All animals will die out, people will starve, the whole village will perish. Let me go Koruke believed the goat and let them go their way without prejudice. And from that day on things went uphill for him. In every hunt he was accompanied by luck, and the whole village lived without worries. Someday met Koruke while hunting on a group of hunters, the a herd of mountain goats circled in the rock. Suddenly he saw that Kaiberen was among them. Koruke frightened the hunters, the animals took the opportunity and already they were over the mountains. That made the hunters very angry so that they caught Koruke and pushed him down the mountain. Koruke fell, but before he hit the ground, Kaiberen saw him and turned Koruke into an eagle and made him ascend to heaven. Koruke returned home transformed into an eagle, but nobody recognized him. Because that is a very healthy man can turn into an eagle so quickly, who could believe that? According to the popular saying: "Those who come voluntarily bring happiness" they welcomed the eagle benevolently, Loved, petted and adopted him. As an eagle brings Koruke everything that comes under his claw, home, and thus takes care of the family. Did my father become an eagle too? He just wanted to save the foals! He wasn't torn away from the river! Father! Grandmother, here comes my father flying in! Looks! Mother! Grandmother look at this. There he is! My father is flying there! Mama. - What? - Have you seen the eagle? Yes, I have. This is our father, I know. Good, but sleep now, my child. Oh! It looks like Ulan is coming! - Where, grandfather? - Over there! - Your brother is coming. - Ulan Bayke! Hey Bayke! Oh my dear how was the trip May the spirits of your ancestors have evil tongues and keep evil looks away from you. - Spit three times. - Me too! Come here my darling! Spit! You have grown. Come in. Are you all right? Umsunai, here is your ice cream. Trara! Great, thank you, Uncle Ermek! This is for you, grandfather. A Swiss knife with everything. Insanity! Thank you, Ulan! What a present! God bless you! The next time I'm invited and cut meat then I can brag about it. This is for you, grandmother. From India. Your grandmother loves you more than anything. May God give you a long life and illuminate your life path. And what about me? Wait, it's mom's turn first. So that you don't get wet in the rain. Ouch! What is that? Mom, may I? Take it. Give me some more horse milk. Rain, - how did the course go? - Good. What's new in town? Nothing new. Revolutions and construction sites. So everything is the same as before. When you're fed up, throw it all away and come home! Tell me... have you gone crazy? Let him study get his diploma, and then we see the weather. "Let him study What's the point? He's going to meet a chick in town and never come back. - And everything sticks to me. - It is enough. Ulan already knows what he's doing. He can decide for himself, let him. This is for you. Oh God! I'm not sure if I'll be back. I study architecture, you need that more in the city. Yesterday our father came over to fly. - Who? - Father. He's not dead. He flies around as an eagle. Supposedly they're building a railway line right here through our valley. For this they need architects and there is a lot of work for Ulan. Hopefully they'll start doing it soon. Oh, you like that! Let them blow up the mountains and tear up the earth. If you let her carry away the last stone. - It's time to milk the mares. - I have to go too. - And now an amen. - Amen. God is with you. Whoa Bayke? What is the city like? The city is very big and beautiful too. Is it as big as our Chonashu Valley? And so beautiful? It doesn't come close to the Chonashu Valley, but it's interesting. What's interesting there? Well, you can go to discos and the movies. What is a discotheque? What is that? A place where you can dance and meet girls. Huh? Girls go there too? What good is a discotheque without girls? - And? - What and? Did you find a girl Yes, I have. - So are you getting married soon? - Do you have to get married right away? Was? He met grandmother when he was a grandfather and they married. And father was born. Then our father met our mother, they got married too, and we were born. And if you get married, you will have children too. That's how it used to be. It's different now. Then what do you need a girl for? You understand that when you grow up. Grandfather! Grandfather! Oh dear! At this point in the river, your father was torn away. Remember them. This brown stallion has been leading the herd for years. In all this time he has never allowed a mare or a foal is ripped off by a wolf. He knows his flock very well. And he also reliably goes along with our milking times. When I die, I would only entrust him with the task to bring my soul to the hereafter. And how will the herd do without him? The leadership will take over that young stallion there. Rain! We are very happy that you are here. You are our support and hope for the future. This young stallion was determined to be yours. Thank you grandfather. - Catch him and ride him in. - Okay. Thank you very much. You are. Be careful, keep your distance! He should get used to the saddle slowly. You have probably forgotten everything. The sweat blanket comes in front of the saddlecloth. Grandpa let me do it, I already know. A.! Look, grandfather rides my umbrella. Where does he want to go? To Alym Ata to bring him milk. Ulan Bayke, should I tell you a secret - And you don't tell anyone either? - No, I do not. Uncle Ermek took a liking to our mother. So they are going to get married. - He seems like a good man. - And our father? Look, Umsunai, should our mother be alone forever? Our father has long been dead. You didn't even get to know him. Father is not dead, he flies around as an eagle. He flies around as an eagle? Yes, right, Umsunai, he flies around as an eagle. Umsunai, what I said was just kidding. - Umsunai, look, there is our father! Over there! - Where? - Over there! - Father! - Dad! - Father. - Father! - Dad! Umsunai... should I show you something? - What then? - Come along. Who painted this Our ancestors. Look there! Look that over there! Let's go there. My love, straighten the bed. - I do not feel good. - What's happening? You glow. Poet! Come on in for a moment. You've never been inside. It is comfortable. Play it? Now and then I play. Then play me something. Please sit up! Drink while it's hot. It will do you good. Poet. Bald... I'll be transferred to the city. I have there... a lovely house, but... the woman in it is missing. Poet, if we got married would that be the future from Ulan and Umsunai... beneficial... Please Shaiyr... Thank you for the wonderful sounds. But the two of us can never be together. Why? Why? Why Shaiyr? It is impossible. - Mama! - You are still! Why is she crying? Did Grandmother abuse her? I don't know, Umsunai. Maybe she has. Maybe not. Let's go home. Ah, I know I broke your mirror. Come on let's go home Wash yourself "but if you have guessed". - I will not recover. - Pooh! May your tongue fall off! What are you talking about? I had a dream... Dreams are foam. You dream all kinds of things. Tell me, I will interpret it. I wanted to tell you in the morning but I didn't mean to worry you. He just seemed... so real. If you're scared you should have told the river about it. Last night I was woken up by the clatter of hooves. I heard, like a rider dismounted. "Father" he called. It was our son's voice. I got dressed quickly and went out. Our son... The same horse as then and the same clothes as then. We hugged... as if it were... Reality. "The river tore us away that shouldn't have happened, "he said. "I'm sorry that you couldn't traditionally bury me. We don't have much time. He helped me on the horse and sat behind me and we rode away. And what about me? Do you want to leave me all alone? Always with Tranquility. I am not dead yet. Listen to me Don't bother take my body to the local cemetery. I want my final resting place can be found in the vastness of Chonashu. My eagle, now you are flying high up in the sky Now you are following your son, my eagle The angels will help you to find yourselves in the hereafter Now the two of you are flying high And leave me in sorrow and envy I look after you with longing But you never return My eagle left me Oh, I'm all alone, burned in pain Stay healthy wherever you go. May God be good for you and protect you, my boy. Take care of yourself, grandmother. Study hard and make us proud, my son. Take care. When are you coming back? - In the next holidays. - Will you bring your girlfriend with you then? I really want to see her. Okay. Have a seat. Good luck for the future. Now you are the head of the family. What! I wish you all the best. And family happiness. Good Trip. - Take care Umsunai, see you. - Goodbye. Farewell, Shaiyr. Grandmother, I heard Sütak sing. Give her a cup of milk. Put them on the ground and bow three times. And say: "I have forgiven you." I have forgiven you I have forgiven you I have forgiven you Mama!
