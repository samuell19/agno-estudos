The fascination of Ancient Egypt lives on through millennia. It's a fascination borne of the grandness, mystery, glory, and decadence of its people. From centuries of prosperty and bloodshed. Over two thousand years ago, in the fifth century BC, The life of the Egyptians was precarious under the domination of the Persians. The pharaohs naively believed they'd reach an understanding with their enemy. And a woman from Persia became Queen of the Nile Valley. For two centuries, Persian rule had brought nothing but slaughter, devastation, and misery to the country. Humiliated, persecuted, and suffocated, the Egyptians were unable to find the necessary strength to regain their liberty. Village leaders, woe to you who have lied. O' Great Pharaoh, we are poor but we don't know how to lie. We've come to reveal to you the great injustices done in your name, because we know you to be fair, good, and beloved by your people. Follow me. The Pharaoh has arrived, O' Great Vizier. Betrayers. Your heads will fall! All of you! You may dispose of our heads at your pleasure, O' Great Armiteo. Only tell us what crime is it we've committed. It is not before me that you're guilty, but before my kin: the people of Egypt. Tell us! Say what you told me! O' Great Vizier, it's so long since we had peace in our villages, Your men ransack our homes, abducting our daughters, and we know nothing of our daughters. Many times we have pleaded with them for a reason. Why, why? They reply to us: "Orders of the Pharaoh" "His precise orders." My kingdom exposed to this shame! And in my name! You'll pay with your heads. - Everyone! - Pharaoh, the guilty ones will pay. But don't abandon your righteous ire. Your heart suffers. Return to your room now. You can decide later what punishment they deserve. - Yes, my dear. - Perhaps it's better that way. - That's her, that's the one! Yes, I recognize her. I recognize her eyes. Who do you recognize? @ we were taken underground. then taken to the market only to be sold as slaves. She too was underground. @ She's the one who gave the orders and chose the ones to be sold. It's her, her! How could you listen to him? A stupid boy! You lie! @ Girls were there but not men. And I'm a woman. Here's your proof! I escaped! And I know you, I know you! Then it's true. You... my wife? Everyone out! I assure you that you will have justice. Away with you too! You'll get the punishment you deserve. I did it so your kingdom would shine with a splendor never seen before. The sale of these women brings you money. Who do you think pays for the @ of your kingdom? The magnificence of your shows? The grandeur of the monuments being built in your honor? You think they're paid for with peasant taxes? Wretch! For years, I've lived in mockery. @ I kept silent because I wasn't aware you'd descend to this infamy. But now... Guards! Come here! - Does it hurt anymore? - No, it's already better. Why must you leave if the wound hasn't healed? It's necessary. Tomorrow, I must go to the caves of Baltor. Who's waiting for you? A woman prettier than me? There is no woman prettier than you. Why don't you tell me who you are? You defended me, even saved me. and got injured doing so. Yet, I know nothing about you. What are you looking for? I was looking for happiness, and I found it. Then please stay. My sister and I will cure your wounds, better than all the medics in Tanis. Only lords from the city wear rings like yours - But all I know is that you are my love. - And you are mine. Isn't that enough? The sun is high. It's late. And you have to leave... I'll come back for you soon, to be with you forever. Nofret! Your sister has become mute ever since Kenamon's left. I brought you some food. There are so many good things. I'm not hungry though. Listen Nofret, don't be sad. He'll be back, he has to come back. @ He promised me. "I'll come back for you", he said. Forever. Let's eat something now. Want some? The Persians! There was a legend about a man, a giant, who many believed to be the son of Samson because of his supernatural strength, courage, and magnificent deeds. The oppressed Egyptians had heard him called Maciste, and they lived in constant hope that this giant would be their redeemer. They prayed that as Samson had crushed the Philistines, so would the son of Samson crush the Persians. - Look out there! Thank you. I didn't think any lion would get up here. I've been traveling for days, and I haven't seen any. Another one! I saved your life and immediately you saved mine. We're even then. - You travel without armor? - This is my armor here. You're the strongest man I've ever seen! When I recount your feat, no one will believe it. But tell me your name, so that I may know the name of the man who killed a lion with his bare hands. - My name is Maciste. - Maciste, what a strange name. What does it mean? It means I was born from the rock. And who are you? You may call me Kenamon. And for you to remember it, here, accept this ring as a token of our friendship. In Tanis, show it to anyone and you will find me. Please keep it. I have nothing to give you. You already said I had no debts to you. You lack of pride is only a strength. @ Up! Goodbye. I hope to see you again in Tanis one day. Good luck to you, Kenamon. Good luck! Good luck! - I can't go on. - Be brave, Nofret. Return to your village. You there, why is the city so silent? Our city has plunged into sorrow. Can you tell me what happened? The Pharaoh is dead. Armiteo the Great is dead. Father... My father. He was a loving father, Kenamon. How many others mourn like children @ the immature death of our sovereign? I for one who humbly served him, and all the people to whom he brought peace and justice. How did he die? The gods took his breath for his time had come. Armiteo shall live forever in the hearts of his people. The Queen ordered his sarcophagus to remain open until you returned to the palace and bid your father farewell. What was that? Three days ago, while he was dying. That's how the doctors and the high priest found him. The funeral honors were exceptional. The people were very fond of him. They won't forget him. You will now ascend the throne and rule Egypt at a very difficult time. I've never met a man as generous as you. I would've liked to do more. Without you we would've been sold as slaves. But if I had arrived sooner, I could've saved the others too. And now where do you go? I don't know, I do not choose my destiny. That's not true, Maciste. You can choose your destiny. In fact, you've chosen it long ago. Because it's decided by your conscience and feelings. What do you know of my feelings? My eyes don't see but there are somethings that my heart and mind see clearly. Tonight I was locked in my chapel, on top of that hill and couldn't sleep. When I heard a mysterious voice telling me to come to you. And it was that voice that guided me here among the ruins of this village. I knew you were coming. And I was waiting to meet you. Tell me what I must do now. The gods have sent you to help the Egyptians free themselves from this atrocious slavery that has been going on for centuries. But do not forget that I'm only a man. You're invincible because you're in the right. Once your voice is heard, it will launch the redemption of Egypt. @ Its people will follow you. These people who will go wandering tomorrow need a guide. Go, go to Tanis and follow your destiny. - It was easy getting them to believe the story about the disease. - Of course. And so will all the others belive it. Under the bandages, the wounds can't be seen. I swear to you, O Father, that I shall follow your noble example. Death took you from me and your people too soon, and I thy son was away from you. But I will continue your work, Father. In your name, I'll bring peace and justice to our people. In your name I will annihilate the enemies of Egypt. I promise you. It's the pain that makes him talk like that. - But he's still a boy. - Boys can be dangerous. He'll calm down once we're married. And if he doesn't consent to marry you? It won't be difficult to convince him! - Have you seen Nofret? - No. - Tekaet, what is it? - My sister's not there. I can't find her. We can't leave without her, I looked everywhere. But you didn't look under the trees near the little oasis. My mind tells me she's there. Nofret. There you are. Why didn't you answer when you heard me calling you? - We're ready to depart. - I'm not going with you. I'm staying here. You can't be serious. Staying alone in this oasis, why? What's stopping you from leaving? A promise. A promise made by the man I love. He told me to wait here, and I will. I must wait until the day the vultures take me. Oh, Nofret, come with us. You'll find your Kenamon. Kenamon? I know him, he saved my life. - Really? Where did you see him? - In the woods. He said I'd find him at Tanis. - Why should I belive you? - I swear to you. I saw him before coming here. We're going to Tanis too. You'll see him again. I don't belive you. You're just saying that. Your Kenamon had a scar on his right arm. Isn't it true? Now do you believe me? Tekaet. Kenamon. What do you want from the desert? An inspiration? Counsel that will enlighten your heart? The desert doesn't counsel me. The desert fascinates and attracts. So you'd like to return to the desert? Now that you're king, you must live in your palace. I've travelled the land and met my people. And I've never felt so alive as I did that night when a village hosted me, and the peasants shared with me their meager food. The peasants... So much sympathy wasted on them. You don't know what treachery lies behind their humility. What do you know about it? What would you know if you've never worked with your hands? Forgive me, Smedes. I don't want to offend you. I know that you love my people too. You and I together will bring Egypt to all of its glory. Our wedding will mark the rebirth of this nation. I can't, Smedes. It's too early since my father's death. Believe me, I feel that I wouldn't be able to make you happy. It seems to me that you love another woman. Very well, then I'll leave you to your thoughts and solitude. And time will help you see clearly ahead. But beware! Our union is dictated by the supreme interest of the state. - There's the oasis! - I told you. - Finally, there's water for all. - But, make it quick, ok? We must fill all the bottles we have with us. We can't stay for long. We must get to Memphis before it gets dark. Come on, run. But there's no water! - The well is dry. - How come? We'll have to look somewhere else. What's going on? - The well is dry. - It's not the only one, unfortunately. Hurry, let's get to Memphis. Hopefully, we'll find some there. Come back to the wagons. You must hold out until we get to Memphis. One man... One man alone defeating 20 soldiers. It's unthinkable! He must be a god. He's a man of great strength. He lifts boulders like they're pebbles. - I refuse to believe that! - Yet, it's true. He freed all the women. - And our soldiers? - Almost all were killed. The few survivors are terrified. They say that his strength is almost supernatural, invincible. I'll believe it when I see it with my own eyes. Send the reinforcements right away. We must find that man and capture him... - ...alive. - Thy will be done. In the village, there's a girl named Nofret. Give her this ring, and tell her I haven't forgotten her. Tell her to wait for I'll be back soon. Go now, while it's still dark. Run! Stop him, bring him back! Let go. The servant told all. He was to go to a village in the desert to locate a girl named Nofret, and tell her that Kenamon will join her soon. Here's the proof. And that's not all. The village is the one where the women were freed. Listen, there's only one way to resolve this situation. Come. I would've liked to avoid it but Kenamon is too great a danger. This has the power to cloud the memory... to numb the will. Whoever wears it will fall into an endless ecstasy. ...an intoxicating nothingness. Kenamuon will forever be enslaved to the Queen's will. A drop of water, for my baby, have pity. There isn't any. This well is dry too. These wells are all dry. A drop of water! Maciste, you're the only one who can save us. @ - Please, Maciste, help us! - Calm down! You saw with your own eyes that the wells are dry. Get in the shade and don't despair, we'll find a solution. - Were you able to find water? - There isn't any in the wells. A caravan! - Hello, Grandfather. Damn, it's hot in here! Maybe it's the presence of all these beautiful girls. Don't joke, these poor girls are dying of thirst. It's a shame. The wells are dry. My baby! My baby is dying! Just a little water. My baby will die of thirst! Please, a drop of water. Or my baby will die! Haven't you some water for that poor woman? Maybe... But we finished it. The only water left is in the belly of my camels. We mustn't laugh at those who suffer @ if we don't want misfortune to fall upon us. Could you guide me to Tanis and get me into the city? Oh, it's easy to get in during these days of festivity. What's the occasion? The coronation of the new king. It happens every year. Would you help me find friends to fight for the people's liberation? They're too afraid. At best, you'll find some willing to listen to you. Aside from friends, you'll have to take care of it. - When can we go? - Righ away, no point in staying. What are we doing in this oven, anyways? Maciste, you must follow the destiny the gods have chosen for you. Don't hesitate to leave these people you've helped. The Egyptians await you to put an end to their misery, @ is it "date" or "da te"? to the bondage they've been subjected to by the invaders and their accomplices. Once I've found a number of disgruntled people... I know what I have to do. You'll find the disgruntled in every house in the city. You'll see desperate people all along Egypt. They'll listen to what you tell them and will be ready to follow you. Imbecile! If we give them water, what will we drink? Merchant, come here. I think it's best if we leave in the evening and travel at night. Agreed, but it seems the sun never sets. Give me it, I'm dying of thirst! I can't take it anymore. - Give it! - Let go! - You drank enough! - Let go! - Give it! - Enough! - I'm thirsty! - It's mine! Stop, don't fight! Break it up! @ - Where did they find that water? - On the camel there. Scoundrel! You're a heartless scoundrel! Denying water to these poor women and children. You don't deserve to live! Water! Come, there's water! Water! Drink! You want some too, drink. Thanks. Tell the queen I cannot receive her now. I'll go to her later. The High Priest sends you this gift to bring you good fortune. I've waited so long for you. Now, I'm happy. When I'm close to you, everything in my life becomes more precious to me. Look, Nofret. Doesn't he look like a god? Yes, yes, I know. Now let me sleep, I'm tired. There's something strange about him. He's not only strong, be there's a kind of divine light in him that I seem to recognize. I don't know how to explain it. Tomorrow, now rest. I can't sleep. - Are you afraid of the jackals? - Yes, that too. May I stay here? Next to you, I don't fear anything. A person like you exists only in my dreams. You're kind and beautiful. And your eyes have a sparkle that I've never seen before. I don't know what you see in my eyes. But I feel inside me something new and beautiful that I've never felt before. The time has come. I must follow my destiny. You'll always be a sweet memory. You know something, when I first met you I had the impression of having seen you before, and now I know why. My mother would take me as a child to the Temple of Amun. And there she made me kneel before the statues of the gods. They were huge sculptures, and you resemble one of them. You look like the living image of a god. Tanis is the most beautiful city in the world. It's your first visit, right? Isn't it marvelous? It's just as I imagined it. As though I'd seen it before. You can't enter! Go on you filthy beggars! Why are you not allowed to enter the city? - They say we're beggars. - And the Pharaoh doesn't like them. It's useless, the Pharaoh may change, but the injustice continues. You'll see that he won't be sent away, that one. - Here you go. - Thank you, go ahead. Thank you, sir. See, everyone knows he's a filthy trader in women, Yet, that's the power of money. - What's this, why? - Trust me, I know what I'm doing. Wait for me at the usual place. I'll meet you there. Let's go. Greetings, boss, you remember me, right? yes, I remember you, but who is that? He's a very wealth cloth merchant I was lucky to have met him. Tomorrow, the caravan arrives with his merchandise, and you'll be the master of choice. Let's go. - Take it back. - Why? - I don't like to pretend. In the city, we all wear masks. We have to hide our feelings and our identities. You have to be very cautious. Alright, I'll be cautious. Stop it! My father's innocent. - Let him go, cowards! - Go away. My father didn't do anything, he has no money to pay. Get him! @ Hit him, up there! To the ladder! Get the ladder! Come here! Get it up, quickly! @ Cut it out! @ Stop it! Stop it, Maciste. You'll ruin me! My son! Dad! We couldn't find him. You must find him at any cost, and bring him here dead or alive. The example this man sets can be dangerous. If he escapes, you and your men will be held responsible. He can't escape. My guards are hunting him down all over the city. - Get in there. Don't move! Hey, did you see a tall man pass by? - No, no one. - Come on. In here. We need men like you. Come, come to my father. Thank you for helping me and my boy. And your wounds? These are nothing. There are others far worse off than me. I am here to help them. These are my trusted friends. There are many like them who hate Persians and that evil woman. - They've seen you and believe in you. - Hey, some gratitude! All compliments to him and none to me? Will you give me compliments, dear? Stay put here. Who's moving? - He's not inside any house. - Must have disappeared. - We've looked everywhere. - It's pointless. - Have you seen him? - No. - Go the other way. - Very well! The people need a leader like you who will lead them to freedom. That's true, Maciste, everyone would follow you. It's true that prisons are full of slaves, unfortunately. All of Egypt is a prison, everyone is a slave. The cowards are we who remain silent. @ Those in chains are the bravest. It's the slaves I want to speak to. They must know know that there's somebody who hasn't forgotten them. And that the day of rebellion is not too far away. You can't imagine how they live and how they're treated. Worse than animals. Come on now! Pull it harder! Work! Work! Have mercy! Get to work! Cowards! Not an ounce of pity. Have pity on me, you're scaring me to death! - Who are they? - The Pharaoh and the Queen. - Kenamon? - Exactly. Why, do you know him? See? They're erecting the obelisk in your honor. I don't care about anything. I don't live anymore. You stole all my toughts, Smedes. Within two moons, Kenamon, after the mourning, we will get married. He's the same. I must find a way to talk to him. What are you saying, are you crazy? Look! Look! The ropes are failing! @ (English dub: Tie the cords! Support it from the other end.) Run! Activate the pulleys! @ @ My leg's caught. Go now. Prepare to bring up the rope for equilibrium. Come on. Give me a torch. This is the burrow that leads right to the prison. Some escaped. You'll need the strength of two bulls to move this. Come on, move it. You have to put it back. Come on! You, push from that side. Go and check the prisoners. - But did you really see him? - Yes, it's him. Come see for yourself. It must be the gods who sent you. How did you manage to get in here? Walls and gates are obstacles that can be overcome. What's difficult to overcome is human wickedness. If you wanted, you could break these @ chains. - Give us back our freedom! - Help us get out of here! It would be useless if they catch you. We'll never let them take us. We'll fight back! - Without weapons? - @ ... sickle, axe, knife. It will take real weapons to face the army, and you'll have them when the time comes. Outside there are men who will lead you to liberty. But you must be careful. The guards! - Tell us Maciste what are you planning? I'll try to enter the Pharaoh's palace. That's where all the evil comes from. You want to kill the Pharaoh? No, I just want to talk to him. I'm sure he'll listen. Perhaps... but the queen? The queen is not Egyptian, and the gods have decided that Egypt shall be free. That's the goal of my mission. I pledge it. Hurry, hurry after him quickly! What's the matter with you? Get close to him! - Well, did you catch him? - It was impossible. He entered the cell of death. This is my reply. Then you've understood well. - He escaped from the cell of death! - That's impossible! He's not crushed between the walls. He broke down the door and disappeared. Rummage through everything. He must be captured! Follow me, all of you. Let's go. @ The enemy! Be careful! Ah, just the person I was looking for. I don't know you, sir. Don't "sir" me, you know me well. No, you must be confusing me with my cousin. Silence! Don't lie. I saw you entering the city gate with your merchant friend. Wasn't he a little too sturdy for a merchant? Grab him! Hold on to him. @ So you're a slave, go on! He passed out. We need to make him talk. Woe, if dies before telling us what he knows about the conspiracy. A bucket of water will suffice to wake him up. Throw it. So, are you going to talk? I don't know anything. No, not that. I'll tell you everything you want to know! I'll tell you everything! Where is that man now? I don't know, I swear! I met him in the ruins of Memphis a few days ago. Where did he come from? He didn't say anything about himself? His plans? Nothing. He was with a group of women he had led from a destroyed village. I don't know anything else. I'm telling the truth, believe me. Look for the women, they were headed to Tanis. I told you everything, I swear! I don't know anything else! Capture those women. We'll make them talk. And if they won't, they'll meet your fate. Is this fine? Yes, do the same with the others. - How did it go? Tell us. - I had to escape. - If I had the chance to talk to him... - What will you do now? We'll wait for the right moment. In a few days, games will be held in honor of the new Pharaoh. Everyone will be rushing to see them, even the guards. That will be our moment. Great, we'll all be ready by then. Everyone is enjoying watching the great chariot race. And we get nothing. We're stuck in here guarding you dogs! I wanna enjoy myself too! Start moving! You, on your feet, everyone make a running circle! Get on with it! Run, faster! Faster! I said run in a circle! Run! Run! The reward for your victory is the Pharaoh's golden palm. For the glory of our sovereign, you will also have the privilege of punishing the traitors who have taken part in a conspiracy against our Pharaoh. Everything's ready. Maciste is here, everyone is on alert. @ - Have you followed my orders? - All done. - And the weapons? - They're ready. We have more than we need. - And the slaves? - On notice, just waiting for the signal. I heard there's going to be a big surprise after the race. - Better this way. - Everyone's ready. @ We're all mixed in with the crowd. I'll give the signal by jumping on the Pharaoh's stage. - We have faith in you. - Go Maciste! Victory will be ours. Come forward everyone. Witness the execution of the traitors. Come forward. Hold it. Come on! Come on! Nofret! - Nofret! - Tekaet! Arrest him! You are valiant, foreigner. And very strong. Stronger than all these men. You deserve a reward. - Tell us what you want. - Thank you, my Queen. As a reward, I ask for their freedom. I'm sure the Pharaoh will deny you your wish. And I am sure that you will appreciate his generosity. - It's Kenamon. It's disgraceful! To think that we were all ready. Maciste betrayed us. Nonsense, if he did that, he must've had a good reason. The queen enchanted him with her dreamy eyes. - Our worst enemy! - She likes strong men. Strength has nothing to do with it. It's about the brain. I'm telling you, he's lost his brain! @ Stop this foolery and don't defend him. Right now, Maciste doesn't give a damn about you or any of us! I've always wanted a man like you. A real man to hold me in his arms. Why did you save those women? Women are born to love, not to be killed. Don't you agree? I always keep my promises. But now you mustn't think about those girls. @ My queen, the sunshine of your beauty dims every memory and thought I've ever had. This is a happy day for me. I want to celebrate it. I have prepared a nice surprise for you. Wait here. Don't worry, it's not worth it. We know the Queen. She'll soon tire of him too. Maybe, but his presence in the palace is a danger to all of us. Look! There he is! Kenamon, do you remember me? Who are you? I'm Maciste don't you recognize me? Certainly, I saw you in the arena. But before that, in the desert. You saved my life, don't you remember? - They're all here. - Thank you. Hurry, hurry, don't waste time! Why abandon us like this? One woman is enough to erase all memories from a man's heart. I can't believe it. - Nofret? I don't know her. I don't know what you're talking about. of a girl you once loved. Come on try to remember. I only love Smedes and will marry her. Listen to me, Kenamon. It's the queen herself who brought me to the palace. But I won't be her slave, and I won't stay. Try to remember. Don't you recall how Nofret treated your wounds? Or how you killed a lion that was attacking me? I'm here to save you now. Come away with me and rejoin your people. We'll capture the Persians, and you'll return as the real ruler of Egypt. Come on, drink up. Do you truly love me? How can you even doubt it. Would you do anything for me? Sure, why do you ask? Very well. I've decided that Kenamon must disappear. And you offered to help. - Are you serious? The Pharaoh is sacred! - My will is sacred! I decree the laws in Egypt! I find out everything. You're just like a boy. Why? Why did you deceive me? Why did you betray me? Why, what did you accomplish? Only your death. @ (could it also be sonno di morire? sleep of death) To die in a totally unnecessary way. @ Feed him to the crocodiles. See? She got him too. The scent of a woman was enough to change his mind. @ Don't talk like that. Something must have happened. What do you think happened? This morning the guards were talking about it. He's become the queen's lover. - Him as well! - Don't listen to these imbeciles. You're the imbecile! Maciste! Free these men immediately or I'll kill him. Go on tell them. - Do what he says. You're free now. Come with me and I'll break your chains like this. Follow me, the others are waiting for us. Come on! Close the gate, quickly! Don't let them leave the city. Forward! No, my Queen. The rebels have offended you and must be punished. I don't want you to be in danger. - You can send the soldiers. - Don't insist, my love. I'll bring you the head of their leader, I promise. I always knew deep down you'd liberate us. We've been waiting. The men are impatient to fight. Distribute the arms to the men as soon as possible. - See how many there are? - Come on, everyone. Maciste! Now we can start living. I've got great news for you. - What news? - Come with me. What's the news? First, what did your queen tell you about the women from the village? She told me they'd be returned to the village. Liar! On my way here, I saw wagons full of enslaved women, headed to Persia. And it just so happened that those women included Nofret and Tekaet. Poor girls... so they're lost. Nonsense, they were released with a little help from yours truly. Come with me. Go in. - Maciste, at last! - I knew you'd be back. - Tekaet. The Persians! The Persians! Come on, don't wait till they reach here! Come on! - Get back! Come on. Forward. To the bridge. The wagons, come on! Quickly! We're going to cross the bridge now. Where are they? Who are you? Yes, I know, you're the man I saw in the desert near the village I left Nofret. Nofret, you remember her now? Nofret... Nofret... - They're arriving. You've deceived me, stepmother. And betrayed the memory of my father. You persecuted my people unjustly and sold our women. You have bent Egypt to the mercy of foreigners. But now you'll pay for all your evil deeds. You know what awaits you. You will be walled in alive, to appease the gods of vengeance. The law reserves this punishment for traitors and you deserve it fully. You grand vizier will be handed to the people you've betrayed all these years. They will decide your fate. And you Kanemon will pay for your arrogance like your father! Watch out! No, Maciste, stop! Everyone stop! The vizier will be judged by the people! I said the people will judge you. And the people shall! You've won. You've won, Maciste. You've won, but you won't take me alive. You won't take me alive. - Thank you, Maciste. Egypt will always remember you. You've done more for this country than all its men. I had to, it was decreed. Thankfully, the gods helped me. - Why don't you stay with us? - It's not possible. My destiny pulls me far away. To other places and people in need of help. But perhaps I'll be back someday, for you Tekaet.
