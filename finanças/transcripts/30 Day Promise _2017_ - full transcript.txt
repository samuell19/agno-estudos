Wait, what is this? That's the Jameson closing. They moved it to this afternoon. When were you gonna tell me? I sent you a text and forwarded you the emails last night. An email? Yeah. I'm sorry. That's all right, I know you've been under a lot of stress. When will it end? I just need one day to breathe, just one day. Let me help you relax. That's nice. Oh, okay, I'm good, thank you. Okay. Let me know if I can do anything else to help you relax. Okay, thanks, but I'm good. I'm good, thank you. Okay. Oh, but can you send in the Talbot files and see if you can get the Jameson closing moved to four o'clock? Mm-hmm. Hey. Hey, honey, finally made it home? Yes, yeah. This month has been crazy at the office. Whoever said all money ain't good money was a prophet. Now I see what he means. I knew you guys were busy down at the office, but it sounds like you're swamped. Yeah. How's your new assistant working out? - Who, Jessica? - Yeah. She's cool. Good, so are you going in tomorrow? I should, but I'm not. I hope you're gonna relax. Hey, I was thinking. Let's go away for the day. Just me and you. We can see if the kids can hang out with their friends or something. We can't. D.J. has a basketball game, and Danielle has dance rehearsal. Can't we find anybody else to pick them up? No, it's D.J.'s last basketball game, and Danielle, she has a solo in the recital, I need to be there just in case she forgets something. Okay. Look, why don't you take the day and just, I don't know, have a mini retreat? A mini retreat? Yeah, you know, spend the entire day, just you and God. Yeah. You could go to the beach. You can take your Bible and chair. You can, you know, pray, sing, meditate, swim. Yeah, that sounds good. Come on. So when you get back, I'll run you a bubble bath and I'll make dinner for you. Sounds good. Are you hungry? Yes, I'm starving. So how about you go get out of these clothes, and I'll make you a plate? Okay. Yeah. Hey, can you check on the kids? Yeah, sure thing. Thanks. Hello. Hey, can you talk? Right now is not a good time. Okay, when would be a good time? I don't know, I can't talk right now. How about tonight? It'll have to be late. The kids have practice, and I have a meeting. Look, Heather, we really need to talk. Look, Dan, I need to go, bye. Okay, Heather, Heather. What are you reading? Matthew 26, it's where Jesus is in the Garden praying and preparing to accept God's will. Great passage. Yes it is. So what's the news? Heather, I'm so sorry. It's stage four pancreatic cancer, and it's spreading fast. If you look here, the cancer's spread throughout your back. It's not good. You can start chemotherapy, but I think it'll be a waste of time. How long do I have to live? Two weeks. Two months. With this type of cancer so aggressive, it's hard to say. Worst case, two weeks? Yeah, I suppose. You're not exactly filling me with a lot of confidence, Dr. Barrows. I can only give you the facts based upon what I see. I know. You're more than welcome to seek a second opinion. How certain are you? Very. Heather, I'm so sorry. I know. I know. Can I call someone to come pick you up? No, I'll be okay. I'm gonna prescribe something to help you feel better. Will it make me tired? It'll numb the pain and help you to sleep. Okay. It should make you feel better in the mornings, but please, take it easy. Okay. I'm gonna go call this in. Please, take your time. I'll be right back. Hey, honey. Are you okay? I'm fine, I just have something really heavy on my heart that I need to talk to you about. What's bothering you? There's no easy way to say this. Say what? Heather, I want a divorce. I think we can both agree that neither one of us has been happy in this marriage for a while now. And, I think it's best we just stop pretending and go our separate ways. I had the paperwork drawn up. Yeah, our marriage has been nonexistent for a while, but I just thought we'd rebound. I thought so too. I just can't compete with the kids and your friends. You're never even here. You're either, you leave early in the morning, you come home late at night, you're never here on the weekends. We just have busy lives, and I thought you were okay with that. I wasn't. I just allowed my work to fill the void. Hmm. Of all the days. What do you mean? Nothing. Okay, look, just read the papers and sign them. I made sure you're well taken care of. And, I'm not hungry, but thanks for dinner. Good morning. Did you stay up all night? Did you get a chance to read the divorce agreement? Are the kids up? Good morning, Sunshine. What's wrong? Last night I asked Heather for a divorce. Really? What did she say? Or do? She was surprised, but it didn't matter because I told her this is what I wanted. Did you tell her about us? No, our marriage was over long before there was an us. So? I mean, does this mean we can finally be a real couple? I'd like that, yes. But let's wait until the divorce is final and I've moved out. You can always move in with me. No, I'll probably get my own place, at least at first. I hope she just signs the paper so we can get on with our lives. The sooner the better. Get one for me too. Say please. Just get me a bowl. - Say please. - I'm not saying please. Fine, then get your own bowl. Hey, guys, cut it out. Look, I need for you to get your breakfast, get your lunch made and get on the bus. You guys have 20 minutes. I will pick you up at four o'clock. Hey. Are the kids home? Yes. How are they? Why don't you ask them yourself? Did you get a chance to read the documents? No. Are you going to? I don't know. Can we talk about this? I'd rather not. Why not? Because I need time to think, Dan. Think about what? What's the rush, Dan? The sooner the better. Better for who? Jim, don't do that, close at 30. We need this closing by Tuesday, okay? Okay, let me call you back. Okay, thanks. She still hasn't signed. Why not? How should I know? She says she needs more time to think. Think about what? I don't know. Did you ask her? - Yes. - And? And she asked, what's the rush? And I just walked away. So, once she signs, how long will it take for the divorce to be final? 60 days. So what now? Now, I go home and convince her to sign those papers. Hello. Oh, hey. Have you eaten? Uh, no. I made your favorites. Yeah, I see, thanks. I think. Can you join me please? Okay. I read over the offer, and everything looks fine, but I have a counteroffer. I don't want the alimony. You don't. No. Nor do I want the house. You don't? No. Okay, really, what's going on here? I would like for you to carry me from our bedroom to the front door every morning for the next 30 days. Carry you? Yeah, just like you did when we got married. If you do this, at the end of the 30 days, I'll sign. So, just carry you from the bedroom to the front door? Just one minute of your day? That's it. No alimony, no house or anything? Nothing. What about the kids? What about the kids? Don't you need more money? No. But you quit your job. How'd you know I quit my job? Because I called to see if you went to work today. So what happened? Did you hit the lottery or something? Why do you ask? I'm just surprised with your counteroffer. Imagine how surprised I was when you asked for a divorce. Can I have a day to think about it? No alimony? No. And she's giving up the house? Yeah. She doesn't have a job, where's she gonna live? I don't know. So what did you say? I told her I needed to think about it. What is there to think about? She's giving you an easy out. This is about my marriage and my children. Please, Dan, you don't care about your marriage. I just wanna be sure she means what she says. Can you get it in writing? That's actually a good idea. I'll call my lawyer and have him draw it up. 30 days, we can be together. In 30 days, I'll be a free and happy man. And we'll be free to do whatever we want. - Hey. - Hey. So, I thought about your counteroffer and I decided to accept it. I even had my lawyer draw up new documents. You should have them by the end of the week. You had my counteroffer drawn up? Yeah. Why? To make it official. So now my word isn't good enough for you? It is, but. Whatever. Okay, what? Forget it. - What? - Nothing, forget it. Look, I just thought it would speed up the process, and at the end of the 30 days we could go our separate ways. That's fine. Okay. Oh, so when do we start? We can start tomorrow, unless you wanna wait for the new documents to be drawn up. No. Tomorrow's fine. Heather, I'm ready. How much longer are you gonna be? Just a couple minutes, I'll be right out. Okay, I'm ready. How do I look? Wow. You look amazing. Thank you. Ready? Yeah, yeah. Hey, what's going on? Dad, what's wrong with Mom? Nothing. Please don't say anything to the kids til this is over. Okay. Dad, what's wrong with Mom? Nothing. Then why are you carrying her? Because I promised I would. Why? D.J., please stop asking questions. D.J., your Dad and I are just trying something different, that's all. Wow, Mom, you look great. Yeah, you look amazing. Thank you. What? Doesn't Mom look great? Yeah, she looks fine. Hey, Dad? Yeah. Aren't you forgetting something? Kiss her on the cheek. Happy? Hey, you guys go get ready for school. So, tell me, how'd it go? It went fine. Any details? Not really. Nothing happened? Like what? I don't know, carrying her from the bedroom to the front door just seems so simple. Well, she did get dressed up. Dressed up, what do you mean? She wore an evening gown. Really? Oh, I knew there was a catch. What's the catch? She's trying to win you back by getting dressed up and having you carry her every day. You think so? Yes. And how do you know? How do you think I got you? Oh. 29 more days to go. 29 days. So, I was thinking. When she moves out, how about I move in? I thought we were gonna stay in different places for a while. I mean, yeah, we were, but that was before I knew she was moving out. No, I don't think that's a good idea. Plus, I'll probably sell it. Sell it? Why? I'm not gonna stay there, and if she moves, why keep it? If she moves out? Yeah, if she moves. But I thought you said she doesn't want the place. She doesn't, but I'm not just gonna kick her and the kids out on the street. No, no. You won't have to kick the kids out, but you can give her a 30-day notice. You really want that house, don't you? I really want that house. It has so much potential. I'll think about it. While you're thinking about it, I'll be shopping for rings. What, what? Excuse me, Dan, I was wondering if you wanted to sit in on this conference call. Yeah, I'll be right there. Okay. Girl, you look amazing. Thank you. I haven't worn this thing in years. Beautiful. Thanks. So, what did the doctor say? Two weeks, to two months. Two weeks to two months? Heather, no. I'm afraid so. When are you gonna get a second opinion? I don't know. You don't know, why not? Because I'm tired. And I don't wanna spend what little bit of time I have left getting a second opinion. Look, I trust Dr. Barrows, I do. Look, I have a few things I need for the two of you to do for me over the next 30 days. Here. What is this? Just please read it and do what it says. Okay. But I love you so much. I love you too. And I'm so grateful for the two of you, because, I honestly couldn't do this by myself. I still remember the day we met. I knew that we would become best friends. I love you so much. I also remember the day when we first met. I refuse to imagine life with you. I just can't. Who are we gonna go to for advice? And who's gonna keep us grounded, and focused? You guys have each other. You'll be okay. Yeah, I know, but our circle won't be complete without you. Please, you gotta stop. I love you guys so much. I do. I love you. - You ready? - Yes. Nice dress. Thank you. I bought it when I thought we were going away for our anniversary. Which anniversary? Our 10th. Are you okay? I'm fine, my back's just been bothering me. Are you sure you're okay? Yeah. Okay, so what happened on our 10th anniversary? You stayed out all night and didn't come home. Okay, um, let's do this. Go, Dad, you're doing great. Thank you. Well, you all have a nice day. Hey, Dad? What? Aren't you forgetting something? Oh, right. Have a good day. Let's go get breakfast, guys. - You ready? - Yes. You guys are up early for a Sunday. No we're not. You're not? We always go to church on Sunday at this time. And we leave early to get doughnuts. Yeah, and Mom always gets coffee. Say cheese. Did you get coffee and doughnuts? Danielle, can you grab my Bible and purse please? Got it. Bye. Bye. See you in the morning. It was so cute. Something smells good. Dad, are you cooking? Hey, Dad's cooking. I know how to cook, okay? Yeah, but I can't remember you ever cooking for us. I've cooked for you guys, right, Heather? Dad, cereal doesn't count. Ha ha ha. You guys, quit giving your dad a hard time. Yeah, stop giving me a hard time. What's gotten into you? What? Come on, Dan, cooking. What? Okay, I know I haven't been a part of things around here, and I just wanted to be a part of something. It's a little late for that, don't you think? Yeah, I guess. I mean, I just wanted to do something. Well, for what it's worth, the kids got a kick out of it. They were surprised, weren't they? Well, maybe we could have it for dinner. Wait, dinner? Yeah, oh, we always stop for lunch after church. You coulda told me. - Good morning. - Good morning. You look great, you ready? Yeah. That smells great, what is that? You don't recognize it? No, it smells familiar, I just can't put my finger on it. I wore it on our wedding day. Oh, that's right. And I picked that out. You sure did. You look great, you ready? I am. Good morning, Sweetie. Good morning. Is that perfume? I think so. Did you have sex with her? No. Then why do I smell perfume? Because she was wearing perfume this morning. She's really starting to piss me off. What? And why are you in such a good mood? I don't know, I just am. You just are. Yeah. Are you falling for her? No, why would you ask that? Because if you are, I will come over there every day and watch you carry her to the front door until she signs those papers. Okay, you need to calm down. Oh, I'm calm. I'm calm, but this little game she's playing can get ugly real quick. Okay, listen to me. Nothing she's doing has any effect on me. It better not. Come here. I love you. And me carrying her to to the door for 30 seconds outta my day, is only bringing me and you closer together. I love you too, but be careful.

Well, you ready? Yes. Okay. So how do you like our little spot? So y'all come here every weekend? This is where we hang out every Saturday morning. Oh, uh, hang on. Hey, I need to take this. Who is it? Um, it's a client. Okay. Hello. Hey, honey. Hey. What are you doing? I'm just out getting some coffee. Oh, where? I'm at the little coffee shop on Fifth Avenue. How long you gonna be there? Not long. I'm gonna meet the guys and play some golf. Okay, everyone, here's your coffee, and your hot chocolate, and one for you. And if you could pass this down to your dad, that would be great. Thank you. Yeah. So, Amanda, do you have any availability to come out to church with us now? I'm glad you asked I actually just switched days with a coworker, so I can finally come to church with you guys. Yes. He has a crush on you. I do not. Danielle, stop. He does. Can I see you today? Uh, I'm not sure. Please, it's been two weeks since we've had some alone time. I can show you some of the other goodies I bought. What time are you thinking? Can you come over around six? I'll see what I can do. Okay, I'll have dinner ready. Okay. Okay, great, see you then, I love you. Okay, I'll see you around six. Hey. What's the holdup? You dad's not here. But it's early, where could he be? I don't know. Hey. Dad. Sorry I'm late. I got in really late last night and overslept. You're here now, so let's just get this over with. Wait, let us go out front first. Thank you. You're welcome. Are you guys ready? Yes. D.J., what's wrong? Dad's not coming. I'm sorry, Son, but I need to get some rest. What does the Bible say, even God rested on the seventh day? Yeah, but, you're not God. Heather, I'm sorry. I guess you are. - Hey. - Hey, guys, come on in. - Good to see you. - You too. It's good to see you. What are you looking at? I have no clue, but, I don't know. But I thought I was looking cute that day. Oh. Right, that's real cute. I was, I was like, I was fine. Oh my goodness, this is Tommy when he was two. He smeared poop all over the... I can't. And when you walked in. And I couldn't do anything because I gagged. It was so gross, but he was so cute. Oh my gosh, so cute. Oh my goodness. Yolanda. Yolanda, what's wrong? What's wrong? I'm gonna miss you, girl. Oh, it's gonna be okay. It is. We need you. We need you. Girl, it's gonna be fine. This is why we live. Remember? God's in control. His timing is perfect. I just, I just can't imagine life without you. We're supposed to grow old and plan our kids' weddings. And pay our kids back for all the drama they caused. Yeah, guys. But I'm going home. I am. We have talked about this so many times. We know. Besides, when your day comes, I will be second in line to greet you. Promise? I promise. I do. How are Dan and the kids taking this? I haven't told them. What? Heather, are you serious? Why haven't you told them? Because, I just wanna spend what little time I have left enjoying them, not crying. Look at me, I do this every day. But, Heather, you've got to tell them. Heather, they're gonna be so angry with you. But I'll be gone. Not telling them just doesn't feel right. It, it's selfish. I agree, you should tell them. No, I can't, not right now. But if you tell them then they can help you. No, I have a few things I need to do, we need to get in order. They can't help me. I need to do this my way. Girl. Why are you being so stubborn? Because I'm the one dying. And this is how I wanna spend my time with them, with you guys. I'm dying. Not them. I just. I just wanna die knowing that my kids are happy. That's all I want. Hey, I'm sorry. I just need a few days to get my house in order. That's all I need. You're right, you're right, I'm sorry, please forgive me. Can we pray, guys, please? Yes. God almighty. Good morning, Sweetie. Good morning. What's wrong? Nothing, nothing. No, come on, tell me. Nothing. What? Okay, um, it's just that, lately I'm not as excited about this as you are. So what are you saying? I'm saying that, um, this is a little harder than I thought. Honey, if you're concerned about the kids, I'll do everything in my power to make them happy. It's not just the kids. Then what is it? I don't know. Okay, okay. Wait, wait, wait. Listen, I'm sorry, but this is just more difficult than I thought. Listen to me. I love you. And I'm gonna do everything in my power to make us work. I promise, when all this is done, you'll have no regrets. Okay? Yeah. Hey, did you have a science test today? No. Dani, what's wrong? Something is going on with my parents, and no one will tell me what it is. What do you mean? My dad has been carrying my mom from their bedroom to the front door every morning before he goes to work. And all she will tell me is that they made a promise. That's weird. I know. Every day? For the past two weeks. Huh. Really? Yes, and to make it even weirder, my mom has been getting all dressed up. Like really dressed up? Yeah, I mean, she looks beautiful, but I just wish I knew what was going on. But I thought you said your parents weren't getting along. They aren't. Or weren't, or still aren't. I'm so confused. I don't know what they're doing, but it's scaring me. Have you tried asking your dad? No. What about your mom again? I don't know. I don't know what I would do if my parents started acting weird like that. Well, whatever the reason may be that they're doing this, if it's helping them get along, I'm sure something good has to come from it. Yeah, I guess. - Hey, dude. - Hey, Dad. Where's Mom? She's out with Yolanda and Kim. When will she be back? I'm not sure. Can we wait for her? Yes, but the food'll be cold. Can we eat and afterwards play video games? Don't you have homework? Yeah, but it's Friday. I know it's Friday, but if you go ahead and get a head start on it now, you can enjoy your weekend. Aw, man. Dad? Yes, Princess? Do you love Mom? Yes, I love your mother very much. Then why don't you spend more time with her? Because I have to work. But is money more important than Mom? No, it isn't. You know, I really like seeing you carry her. Really? Yes, it makes her happy. Hmm, it does, huh? Yes, she is a lot happier now. Well, I love carrying your mom. I never would have thought that something so simple can make Mom happy. Me either. I hope that one day I can marry someone who can make me smile every day. I hope so too. What's wrong? Heather. What's wrong? I don't have anything to wear. Honey, don't worry about that. You don't have to keep getting dressed up for me. You're beautiful just the way you are. Nothing fits anymore. Mom, what's wrong? I don't have anything to wear, Sweetie. It's okay, Mom. Yeah, hey, Jessica, I need you to cancel all my appointments for today and send my calls to voicemail. No, I'm fine. Something just came up here at home I need to take care of. Look, I have to go. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay, Dad, she's ready. She's ready. Whoa, look at Mom. Wow, you look amazing. Yeah, Mom, you look great. You like it? No, I love it. Great job, Danielle. Thank you. You ready? Not yet. Let me look at you for a little while longer. O-kay, this just got weird. I'll be out front. Yeah, me too. Okay, I'm ready. Whoa, did you mean to do that? Yes. Okay. And I was thinking, maybe I'll take the day off today and do something special. Like what? I don't know, what do you wanna do? Just the two of us? Just the two of us. Can we stay home and watch movies all day? Sure. Are you sure you wanna do this? Yes, I'm sure. Okay. Hey, look at me. She must be in the chapel. That's my favorite part. You like this movie, don't you? I do. - I got it. - You sure? - Yeah, I got it. - Okay. It's like another world. Oh, I'll pause the movie. Come on in. Hey, it's actually for you. Really? Yeah. You better go get it. Okay. What are you doing here? I was worried. Look, not here, okay. Why? Step outside, step outside. You're hurting me. Step outside. Dan, why are you doing this? Stop. Worried about what? You. Why you worried about me? You sounded really concerned on the phone about something. Okay, yeah, but why did you come here? Because your phone was off. Okay, this can't wait until tomorrow? No, I was worried. Jessica, you shouldn't have come here. Okay? Okay, look, you need to go, now. No, wait, can I see you later tonight? I don't know, maybe. Please, Dan, I need to see you, please. Okay, okay. Okay, what time? I don't know, around seven. Promise? Yeah, I promise. Okay. Kiss me before I go. What? Dan, kiss me like you do when we're alone. You're really pressing your luck, you need to go. Dan. Go. I love you. Goodbye, Jessica. No, I'm not leaving til you tell me you love me, Dan. Jessica, please, please. No, no. Okay, okay. All right, I love you. I love you, now just go, go. Okay, I'll see you tonight. Why didn't you come over? What? You promised. You promised, you promised, you promised. Jessica, I'm sorry, okay? My son needed help with his homework, and I just lost track of time. But you promised. I know. And I'm sorry. I don't wanna lose you. Jessica, what makes you think you're gonna lose me? Because you stopped coming over, and you don't call me anymore. You stopped saying I love you. You have to understand what's about to happen here. Now as soon as those papers are signed, we can get on with our lives. But you have to be patient. Promise me you won't leave me. What's with you and all these promises? I want you to keep your promises to me like you do to her. Okay, I promise I'll stay true to my heart. Is that good enough? No. No. How many days do we have left? How many? 10. 10 days. Can you play it cool for 10 days? I guess so. No. I need for you to make these last 10 days drama-free. Now can you promise me that? Well, yeah. - Yes? - Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Have a seat. Have a seat. So how'd it go this morning? It went, it went fine. Aren't you tired of carrying her every day? Well, sometimes. But, I really don't give it that much thought. There you are. Hey, is this okay without a tie? Yeah. Are you sure? Yes, smile. Okay. All right. Good morning. Good morning. You look, amazing. Thank you. Are you ready? Yes. Okay, either I'm getting stronger or you're losing weight. Which one is it? So are you still busy at work? Yeah, but I'm starting to delegate more. Good. Are you coming home for dinner? Yes. I love you. I love you too. Are you guys gonna kiss again? You better get going. Yeah, okay. Hey, can I take you to lunch today? I have a couple of appointments, but I can do lunch. Great, I'll pick you up around noon. Sounds good. You better go. Bye, kids. Bye. Good afternoon, Jessica. Good afternoon, Heather. Is Dan in his office? I don't know, let me go check. No, don't, it's okay. Actually, we have a lunch appointment today. Oh. Surprise. Hey, what are you doing here? I thought I was picking you up. I thought I'd surprise you. Okay well. Um, I'm surprised. Um, have a seat. So, where we going for lunch today? Well, I thought we would check out that new cafe downtown. Okay, that sounds wonderful. Are you okay? You're breathing a little heavy. I'm fine. Could I have some water? Sure, sure, I'll get it right away. Can't you ask Jessica to get it? Well, Jessica's busy. She's been doing a lotta stuff, you know, special projects and stuff. But I can get it. Are you sure? It's no problem. Be right back. What is she doing here? I don't know, she stopped by to surprise me. She's your lunch plans? Yes. What's going on, Dan? Nothing. Then why is your soon-to-be ex-wife here about to have lunch with you? I don't know. I don't know is not a good answer. Can we talk about this later? No. Okay, I promise, I'll explain everything as soon as I get back. No, no, no, I say go get Heather and let's talk about this now. No. Yes, why not? Because I don't want to. But I do. Excuse me. I'm thirsty and I'm hungry. Baby, can we go? Yes, yes, I'll be right there. - Okay. - Okay? - Yeah. - Be right out. Okay. Do we always have to do? I like that, yeah. Say cheese. Are you guys ready? Yep, bye, Dad. Bye. Dad, where are you going? Well, I thought I'd go with you guys today. You do know we're going to church? Yes, I know we're going to church. Dad, are you serious? Yeah, I'm serious, and I'll even drive. Oh my God. He's really happy. I am too. Let's go. That was fun today. I had a good time. What's wrong with Dad? He just has a lot on his mind. Let's go get lunch. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I've just been doing some serious thinking, that's all. About what? Hey, what day are we on? Sweetie, can you give your dad and I a few minutes please? Sure. Thank you. What happened? It was something that was said at church yesterday. It's got me thinking. About what? He said life is just a mist. What are you wasting your time doing? That's a great question. Yes it is. I have to go. You look great. Thank you. What's wrong with Dad? He just has a lot on his mind. What day are we on? 25. So, what happens after Day 30? Our lives change forever. What do you mean by that? I'll explain it to you later, but right now I need you to make your cereal so you can get ready for school. Right. Can I ask you a question? Yes. How did you come up with this 30-day promise? And why give up alimony and the house? As much as I'd love to answer you, I'd rather wait until this is over. So what do you expect once the 30 days are over? I expect to sign that divorce agreement, talk to the kids and live out the rest of my days to the fullest. What do you mean? Nothing, what do you expect? Well, I expect to be a totally different person. Okay. I have to admit, it was a clever idea. What was a clever idea? I mean the whole carry you thing. I had forgotten how to keep life simple. It's so easy to get caught up in the rat race, forget that life was never ever meant to be about stuff. In the last 26 days I've learned that Jesus has to be the center of my life and the foundation of our marriage. That's great, Honey. It's so crazy that in four days we could be divorced. And yet here we are, carrying on like best friends. Yeah, I miss this. Me too. Dan? Yeah. Um. There's something I need to tell you. What is it? That cough is getting pretty bad. Yeah. Hey, okay, I'm gonna get you some water, and when I come back you can tell me all about it, okay? I really need to tell you something. Okay, but you need to... I'll get the water, and then you can tell me. Okay? All right? Okay. Okay, here's your water. Now you can tell me every... Mom, I love your dress. Thank you. You know, this is actually the dress I wore when your dad proposed to me? Really? Yeah. And you can still wear it? I can now. Can I borrow it? You can, but only when you get older. Mom, these are beautiful. Thank you. Why haven't I seen you wearing them? You've seen me wear some of them. What did you mean by our lives will change forever? Do you remember the first day that your dad carried me to the front door? Yes. Well, do you see how much more of a family we are now? Yes. See the difference? I do, but how do you know we won't go back to doing things the old way? Sweetie, I don't. Dad's ready. Okay, we'll be right out. All right, you have your camera? Yes. All right, I'll see you at the front door. Can I help you tomorrow? Of course. I love you, Sweetie. I love you too. You okay? No, I don't feel good. You're burning up. Can I get you something? Yeah, my cellphone. Your cellphone? Yeah, I need to call Yolanda and Kim. I can call Yolanda and Kim for you. No, I can do it. Okay, what can I do? Can you make sure the kids get off to school okay? Sure. And you and I will skip today, and we'll start back when you're feeling better. No, no. No? You still want me to carry you to the front door? Yeah. Remember I said no excuses? Okay. Okay. I must look awful. No. Actually, you look beautiful. - Hey, Sweetie. - Hey. Hey. How are you feeling? I've been better. Have you taken anything? No, were you able to pick up my prescription? Yeah, I have it right here. Here. Thank you. There you go, Sweetie. Were you guys able to finish the list? One more thing left. I'm done. Good. Where's Dan? He's at work. And the kids? They're at school. Okay, is there anything else you need for us to do for you? Pray. Mom, wear this one. Oh, no, I'm saving that one for tomorrow. What's special about that dress? Oh, this actually was the dress I wore when I came home from our honeymoon. Your dad carried me across the threshold in it. What's special about the dress you're wearing now? This one? This is what I wore to our rehearsal dinner. Mom, I wanna be just like you when I grow up. You do? Yes. Well, can I give you some advice? Yes. Okay, but first go get your brother. Okay. Hey, Mom. Hey, you guys have a seat. There's something I need to tell the two of you. I don't want you to ever forget. Always put God first. No matter how difficult things may seem, always keep Him first. Even when it seems like He's not on your side, or has your best interest, He does. Okay. Danielle, you're so beautiful, I love you. When you grow up, please keep your life simple. Make God the center of your life. And don't you ever give up on your dreams. I love you too, Mom. D.J., when you grow up, I want you to be a man of integrity and faith. What's integrity? It's doing the right thing, no matter how you look. Okay. I love you. You're my little man. I know, Mom, I love you too. Okay, is your dad ready? Yeah. I guess I'll see the two of you at the front door. All right. - Good morning. - Good morning. I remember that dress. You do? Yeah. You wore it for our rehearsal dinner. You do remember. Yes. And you look as beautiful in it today as you did then. Thank you. So, tomorrow's the last day. Yeah. The last day. I have to say I've enjoyed this. Me too. And you have looked amazing every day. Thank you. Part of me is gonna miss doing this. I am too. Hey, um, I'm thinking of taking a half day. Are you available for lunch? I'll be here. Good. I love you I love you too. Excuse me, I'm sorry, Dan? Oh hey, Eddie, come on in. Can I ask you something? Sure. Can I have tomorrow off? I know it's short notice, but I wanna take my mom out for the day. It's her birthday. Dan? Oh, yeah, that's fine. Enjoy the day with your mother, make her feel special. Thank you. Oh, Eddie? Yes. Didn't you say someone in your family is a doctor? Yes, my sister. Can I ask a favor? Sure. Would you have her take a look at these symptoms? Okay. Who's having these symptoms? Why do you ask? Because at worst, it could be cancer. How do you know? I used to help her study, but I'll call her right away. Thanks, Eddie. Happy one day to freedom. Hey. Hey, my handsome, still to be divorced man. Hey, um, we need to talk. Okay, but if it's about you not moving in with me, it's cool, like, I'm not even mad at that. It's not about that. Okay, then, what is it about? No. No. You are not doing this. Not now, not here. Jessica, I can't leave my wife. You told me you loved me. And I do. But I'm in love with my wife. - You said. - My children. Jessica, I love my family. You said you wanted to be with me. And I did. At first. But then I realized that changing my circumstances does not change who I am. I realized I've got to get closer to God. Why can't you be closer to God and still be with me? The foundation of our relationship was built on a lie. I can't stand before God under those circumstances. Why are you doing this now? I've gotta start somewhere. Jessica, in life, there are no guarantees. And I can't continue living this way. We can't continue living like this. What about me, hmm? What am I supposed to do now? Well, change with me. Turn yourself into God and let Him know that you want a better way. So, does this mean you're gonna tell your wife about us? Yes. And I'm gonna beg her to forgive me. I'm gonna beg my children to forgive me. And I'm asking you to please forgive me. Why now? I don't know. But is there ever a good time to break someone's heart? All I know is I've seen a love greater than mine. Heather has shown so much grace and mercy. And I know that God used her to change my heart. Jessica, the man you think you love isn't worthy of anyone's love. I've been so selfish. And I'm so sorry. So if she leaves you, you're gonna come running back to me? Whether she leaves or stays, it doesn't matter. I just wanna be right before God. And whatever God decides, I will accept it. And no, I won't come running back to you. I cannot believe this is happening to me. Why? Why are you doing this to me? Please forgive me. I can't, I can't even work here anymore. And I have nowhere else to go. Why do you have to quit? I can't be around you. I understand. Here's what I wanna do. I'll give you six months severance and benefits, and I'll help you find a new job. Really? Yes. Why? Because my sin caused this, and I wanna take responsibility. Can I get that in writing? Yes. So what now? Now? I'm gonna go home and beg my wife for forgiveness. Excuse me, Dan. Yes, Eddie. She said that it could be cancer, and whoever this is needs to see a doctor immediately. What, who has cancer, what is he talking about? I have to go. Cancel all my appointments. What? Honey, I'm home. Heather. Yolanda, what are you doing here? Dan, it's Heather. What do you mean it's Heather, what happened? Yolan... Where's my wife? Kim, why are you crying? She, she won't wake up. What do you mean she won't wake up? She's just asleep, Heather. She does this all the time, she just asleep. Heather, baby. Come on, baby, come on, baby. Come on, baby, wake up, baby, wake up baby. Listen to me, listen to me. This isn't funny, Heather, Heather. Dan, the ambulance is here. Heather, listen to me. I don't want a divorce. I don't want a divorce, okay? I don't want you to do that, I just want you. I want my family. Heather. We have one more day, I've gotta carry you one more time. You owe me another minute. Wake up. Hey, Dan? Everyone's waiting on you. Okay, I'll be right out. Where's Danielle? She's in Mom's room. I'll get her. This is the dress Mom was going to wear on the last day. This is the dress. She wore when I carried her over the threshold when we were married. You look beautiful. Dear Daniel. I ask that you please forgive me for the way that I've handled my passing. I just couldn't handle dying under the circumstances we were facing. When you asked me for a divorce, I had just found out I had cancer and that my time was very short. After a lot of prayer, I decided that I wanted to die knowing that our kids viewed you as a great dad and husband. I also wanted to die as your wife. I am so grateful that God allowed me to become your wife and the mother of our two amazing kids. I am so happy to have lived as long as I did and to now go home to my father. I pray that one day I will see you and our children again. Please take great care of them and teach them every day about God, because you are now their example of Jesus. I know this must be hard, but know that God has a plan for all of us. I love you, and I look forward to seeing you again. Your wife, Heather. Dad, you ready to go? Come on. Yeah, okay. I wanna go to the pier. Let's go. I can go for some ice cream. That's actually a good idea.
