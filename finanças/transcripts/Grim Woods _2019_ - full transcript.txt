-=Sync&Corrected by Misiek666=- - Good morning, campers. This is DJ Rockin' Roxy coming at ya! I hope you all are having fun on the last day of camp. It's been a great summer. The weather outside today is wonderful, it's very sunny. Make sure you put on your sunscreen. Just wanted to let you know that tomorrow pickup time will be at two o'clock, so make sure you get lots of rest tonight. And I'm very, very happy that I had all of you guys out here at camp this year and I hope to see you again next year, it's been a blast. So this is Rockin' Roxy signing out for the last time this summer. ♪ That girl is on my mind ♪ ♪ Since the first I saw her face ♪ ♪ Thought I would forget ♪ - Dwayne, buddy, what's going on? What're you doing up here all alone. - I just don't feel like going outside. - Aw, come on. You gotta open up to me. You know, we're boys, we're buddies. Dwayne, you know what I mean, Frankie? - I haven't made friends this year. - You haven't made friends this year. I saw you talkin' to the boys just a half an hour ago. Let's go down stairs and try to enjoy the last couple hours together that we have. What do you say? - Okay, I'll give it a chance. - That's what I like to hear. - Come on, guys, it's lunch! - Ha! - Oh my God! What're you doing? - What are you doing down here? - I'm working. Some of us actually get paid to work around here, you know? - That doesn't sound familiar. - To you, Jody, I didn't think so. What if someone sees us? - There's no one around. - Still doesn't mean we should be doing it here though. You know? - No? Are you sure? - Don't do that. - It's nothing I haven't seen before. - Jody, I... Hey, come here! - What are you doing down here? You're supposed to be with your group. - What do you got there, Stacey? - I found it. - Can I see it? God. - What is it? - Jesus. We're gonna have to hold on to this, Stacey. - Give it back to me. - Stacey, you can not keep this. It's inappropriate. - This isn't fair. - I'm gonna take her back to her cabin. - It doesn't have to be fair, Stacey. - Hey, Natalie. - Hey. - Are you smoking? - Eh, blame it on the family genetics. - Those things will kill you. Can I have one? - Sure. - Yeah, all right. Sure. - I didn't know you smoked. - Yeah, I used to all the time, so whatever. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Hey guys, look what I got. I know what we're doing tonight. - What the fuck is that? - Meet us down at the campfire after the kids go to bed. We have a little light reading to do. - Do you wanna go? - Hell yeah, I'm in. - Yeah? You gonna go? - Yeah. - Okay, okay. Mike, what is that? Where'd you get that? - You excited to read the book? - Kinda. If Michael's there. So, Frank? - What're you talking about? - He's in love with you. Like obsessed, wants you to have his babies level of crazy in love with you. - Okay, that's a little much. - Hey, Michael and I need couple friends. I think it's great. - Wait, you're a couple now, officially speaking? Is that what we're calling it? - Well, we're working on it. He'll come around. - Okay, you tall freakazoid. ♪ This is the story about two camp counselors ♪ ♪ At Elmwood ♪ ♪ Elmwood ♪ ♪ Camp, camp Elmwood ♪ ♪ Sitting by the fire at camp ♪ ♪ Elmwood ♪ - Hey! - About time you girls showed up. - Shut up, we made it. - Natalie, you sit right here next to Frank. - Now that we're all here, I'd like to turn your attention to this. "The Book of Nightmares." There are some seriously freaky shit in this thing. Murderers, witches, child abductions, blood I don't know where it came from but prepare yourselves for the creepiest night of your lives. - I can't wait! - Who wants to read first? - You should go, Mike, this is your night. - If you insist. This one looks good. It's called, "The Clown." - Honey, come on, let's go. Hey, Riley, come on in. - Hey, Mr. Woodward. How's the move? - Well it's a work in progress. It'll be nice once we get the furniture here. The kids are loving the big, open space though. Hey, what took you so long? - I was just checking on Eric. - Hey, Mrs. Woodward. - Hi, Riley, are you all ready for your big night of responsibilities? - As always. - We'll be back by midnight. Eric's asleep for now. And this is what I'm really exciting to show you. You can keep an eye on them from the TV room. We had this new app installed. Come on, I'll show you. You can watch the kids from here. Just hit 263. - If you hit 222, all the movies you could possible dream of. Keep an eye on him. He hasn't been sleeping great lately. He had another minor episode last week. Brittany's in her room. Make sure she's in bed by nine. - Got it. - Thanks, Riley, you're doing me a huge favor. I'm kind of in a lot of hot water right now with the misses. - You get that package? I saw the delivery guy come by earlier. - I did, thank you. - Well, good. I'll keep an eye on it for you. You don't have to worry. You folks deserve a night out after everything. - Thanks, Jim. - Yeah, you have a good night, Laurie. - That's our little Picasso. It's going to be worth a lot of money one day. Don't listen to any of her excuses, by the way. When the movie's over I want her in bed for the night. - Rules are rules, I've got you covered. Do you have any salt and vinegar chips? - Ha, we do we have any sel et vinaigre? - Really, John? 20 minutes you leave me out here? - I didn't ask you to come out here and wait. - I hope you know what you are doing. - Relax, honey, I've thought of everything. Besides, the cops are watching the neighborhood. We need this. - Brittany! - I'm sorry. - All right, missy, how much longer is that movie? Your dad says as soon as it's over... - You just got here though, can I stay up? - No you can't because if you're up past midnight you'll turn into a pumpkin. - Stop it! Stop it! The movie just started, do you wanna watch it with me? - Can't, kiddo, I've got a super important paper due tomorrow morning. What's with all this weird stuff? No wonder your brother's freaked out all the time. What the heck is that? - What? - It looks like there's something sitting in your closet. - Oh, that's just Freakshow. - Freakshow? - Freakshow, he's my friend. He protects me at night and tells me stories. - So he's your doll then? - Sort of. - Okay then. You are one sick kid. - What? - Nevermind, I'll be back in an hour and then it's lights out. God, that thing is creepy. - Freakshow? Is that you? Freakshow? - Hello? - Hey, are you still coming over? - Why, what's the rush? You miss me? - No, actually, there's not a single part of me that misses you. Not even a little. What's taking you so long? - I'm waiting for my mom to go to bed. She's still up. - Oh, you rebel. Well hurry, Obi-Wan Kenobi. Your my only... - What? - Brittany. She has this freak clown and now she's trying to scare the crap out of me. - What's the clown's name? - Freakshow. - Freakshow the clown? That's so lame. - Just get over here or I'll hate you for life. - Give me 20 minutes. - You better be here. - Freakshow! Freakshow! - Brittany, what're you doing? - I'm looking for Freakshow. He left my room before tucking me in. - Don't be ridiculous, you're just trying to scare me. - No I'm not! He's playing hide-and-go-seek and you're it. - Brittany, Brittany, it's time for bed. - I'm not going to bed until I find Freakshow. - This isn't funny! We're going up to your room and I bet you Freakshow is right where you left him. Are you playing tricks on me now? - I told you he's hiding. - That's it, I don't care where your Freakshow is! It's time for bed! - No! - Just go to bed! - You're no fun! - Brittany! - I need to find Freakshow! - No, Brittany! - No, I won't go to sleep without him. - I'm warning you! - Not without Freakshow! Not without Freakshow! - That's it, I'm calling your dad! - No. - Mommy? - Dear Lord, Eric, what're you doing up? - I heard noises. - Brittany, see what you did? That's it, movie's over, go to bed now! I'm definitely calling your dad! Come on, Eric. - Where's my mommy? - Don't worry, she'll be home soon. - Is the Boogeyman here? - No, Eric, there's no just thing as the Boogeyman. Goodnight. - Hey, Riley. Oh my God, what seems to be the matter? - Ha, anyways, I don't mean to interrupt your night out. - Don't worry, Laurie bumped into a couple of her book club friends, so I'm just sitting here talking to the wall. - It's not problem. Brittany was acting up earlier and woke up Eric. - That kid, I tell you, I am going to... - That's fine. I got her to bed but I threatened to call you, so I'm calling you, I guess. - Don't worry, I'll deal with her when we get home. - She's never been that way with me before. She was going crazy about her clown friend, how he was missing. - A clown?! Riley, go upstairs and get the kids now! Take them across the street to my neighbor, Jim! I'll call you there. - Wait, Mr. Woodward, what do you mean? It's just... Don't ask questions, go! - Oh my God. We need to get the hell out of here. - That's the most heartwarming hello you've ever given me. - I didn't! - You've been talking about this guy's pool all week. - You get Brittany and I'll get Eric. - Why are you whispering? - Just do it! - Watch out for the killer clown. - Eric, Eric, wake up. - What's going on? - We're going over to your neighbor's house. Don't you wanna see Uncle Jimmy? - No, I'm tired. - No, no, come on, it'll be fun. Come on, kids, let's go! - Run! - Hello? Hello? Please help, we're inside the Woodward house and there's someone trying to kill us. Please help us! - I'm scared! - Don't worry. There's no way he can get through that door. Window! There's a window. - I can fit through, I've done it before. - What're we waiting for? Let's go! - But Riley. - I gotta get you out first. Holy mother of God! No! No! Run, kids! Run to the house! - No! - Get help! - Let's go call for help. - Riley? Riley? Riley?! Jesus. Come on, come on, don't die. Come on. Get up. - Mom, the Boogeyman came to our house last night. - Okay, honey, it's okay. - Where's Daddy? - Daddy's just gone over to check on Riley and her friends. He'll be back real soon, I promise. - The cops say that they're on their way. - Was it him? - Sounds like it - Goddamn it, I told them that psycho was gonna come back and not leave us alone! How does this keep on happening? What's going on? - It's okay, Laurie. - We have to go over there. - No, no, it's too dangerous. I already told John. - I don't care! - Look, let the police handle it. They'll find him. You've got nowhere left to hide. - You idiot. This one's gonna cost you extra. Dispatch, this is Officer Bradley, car 176. We got two bodies. Better send in the coroner. No sign of the suspect within the immediate vicinity. Contact supervision and get them down here. - Copy that, car 176. Sending assistance. - I'm getting too old for this shit. - Mr. Woodward! Mr. Woodward! Wake up! Bobby! Bobby, breathe! Bobby, don't leave me! - Good evening, sir, could I speak to Laurie Woodward? - This is she, did you catch him? - Ma'am, we looked in the house. There's no sign of the babysitter and we found two dead bodied. - John? Oh. - Can you come with us to the station? We have a couple of questions about Riley. - Why, do you think she has something to do with this? Is she involved in some way? - We found a note written in lipstick in the house. - Well what did it say? - "Now nothing and no one can get in our way." Does that mean anything to you? - No, that's impossible, it couldn't be! - Come with us down to the station and fill out a statement. We'll do everything in our power to help you out. Laurie, don't worry, we're gonna get to the bottom of this. - It's not a cop! Get out of the car, the cop's a killer! Get out of the car, he's gonna kill you! It's him! Get out of the car! - Let me out! - Okay, this is wrong, we shouldn't be doing this crap. - Chill out, Frank. - I'm chill. We should not be messing around with this book anymore. - Are you kidding me? This is the greatest thing that's ever happened to us. This thing is amazing. Look at it. It's a relic. - So, are you okay with this? - I mean, it's kinda creepy but I'm having fun. - So you wanna stay? - Yeah, we have to see how this plays out, Frank. - Come on, Frank, just sit down, we're moving on to the next one. Natalie will protect you. - What the fuck did you do that for, Frank?! - Jody, no! - It's fine. It's not even hot. - Oh, it's still perfect. They really knew how to make these things back in the day, didn't they? - Okay, are we ready to keep going now? - I really don't think that... - Can you just try and have some fun, please? - Yeah, I guess. For the record, I mean... - For the record, we get it. Can we keep going? - Yeah. Yeah, proceed. - Okay, thank you. Jody, it's your turn to read. - I don't know about you, but I see some sparks flying over here. - Just read. - Okay, story time, boys and girls. This one's called "The Gypsy's Curse." - I think we pretty much killed it. We rode every ride twice. You beat me at every game at least once. Home time? - I think you're forgetting one thing. - No, no, we did the bumper cars, the Ferris wheel. - Uh-huh. - I hate to tell you this, I think that's it. - Oh, I hate to tell you this honey but how will I ever know that you're really the one unless the great and powerful Olga tells me so? - You're kidding, right? You don't believe in that crap. - Oh, sorry. We'd like two fortunes told, please. - Only one. - What? - Only one at time. - What did he say? - I think he means only one at a time can go in. Is that right, only one? - Is correct. - "Is correct." Did you get that? - Yeah, I'll go in first but depending what she says in there, I might be going home alone tonight. - Aw, don't be mean. I'll just hang out with Lurch. Good luck. So, you got any hobbies? Basketball? - You sit. You sit. - Are you Olga? - You sit and Olga will tell you all she sees. - Okay, I'll sit. - Good, good. A tea for you, my dear? - Yes, please. - Is boyfriend of yours man outside? - Yes, Kyle. - Please, no need. Olga sees all. - This is fun, thank you. - Now, we get to the bottom was what you seek and what you seek is the future. - I'd love to hear anything you can tell me. Do I become a lawyer? Do Kyle and I end up together? - In time, child, in time. - Sure, what do we do? - First, the future is not for free. Five dollars, if you please. - Oh, of course. - You close eyes when I tell you but first, I will teach you to see. - Is that how you see the future? - Close your eyes, child. Olga sees all. Now, take in a deep breath Breathe in as deeply as you can and let go only when you must. I see a very beautiful woman. She is bearing a red coat. - My mom. - Yes, child. She is holding a tiny baby in her arms. On this day, she knows love. - I miss her so much. - I see no man in this picture. Where is your father, my dear? - He left us before I was born. He didn't want me. - You must forgive yourself for this! The sins of the father do not belong to you! - I know, I'm trying. - The happiness you seek... - What do I have to do? - Close your eyes dear. - Sorry. - The boy that you bring here today. - Yes? - Is a good man, he is very good for you. But I see wings of steel in the sky. Are you going on a trip? - New college in the fall. - When you leave, your relationship will suffer. He does not want you to go. - I know, he keeps forgetting pamphlets for our college at my house. He says he's happy for me but... - He loves you very much. - I know he does. - Is not so simple. When you go, it will be too much for him. - What are you saying? If I go, he'll leave me? - The only thing that is clear, my child, is that you have many big decisions ahead of you. - Will we stay together? You need to tell me. - No. - What?! What is it?! Tell me what you see! - Olga does not like what she sees. - Please, you have to tell me! I want to know! - Olga is not certain that you want to know this future. - Just tell me what you see as you see it! I want to know my future! - I see clouds of darkness in your future. You will feel pain like no other will feel pain. In place of joy and love, you will only experience hardships and a broken heart. When you leave, the love from this boy will quickly evaporate. You are cursed for a life of despair. You will feel the shame of an outcast. Born into a harsh and cruel world, not knowing idea of love. This is what awaits you. There is no hope for you to avoid of the collision course of the life that you have been born into. - Please, no, there must be something you can do. I must have some sort of choice in this. - Olga is afraid that it is too late for that. Your future is smeared in black. There is a curse above you that lives above you forever. This is your path. - What is this, some sort of joke to you? I want my fortune told! A good fortune! I paid the money. - We do not have a decision upon our future, my dear. - Fuck you, Olga! I'm done! - Hey, my turn now. Was it good? What'd she say? - Can we go home please? - What happened in there? - Can you just take me home? - Okay. What'd she say? - Nothing, I don't wanna talk about it. - Well, did she something bad about me? Because I feel like you're throwing anger towards me. - Just stop asking. I just don't wanna talk about it. - Hey, cheer up. It's supposed to be for fun. You don't actually believe that shit, do you? - Well, yeah, I was excited to go in there. - Hey, can we just chat for a second? - I don't really feel like talking. - Text me later? - Don't! - What the fuck? Hey, Rach. - Join us as we journey through space and time and unravel the secrets of the universe to discuss the most pressing matter in the scientific world to date. That time travel is sick! - Sick! - It is real, it is totally amazing and it's possible. You know why? Because Stephen Hawking says so. - Yeah, he did. - Yeah, he's like smart. He reads books and stuff. - I wish I could. - So the government knows it's real and are they gonna tell us? No they're not. Because what're we gonna do? We're gonna cheat the lottery. We're gonna avoid taxes and we're gonna skip out court dates. All you need to do, take a rocket, go to space faster than the speed of light, turn back around, come back the other way. Boom, back in time. So, in conclusion, Stephen Hawking's my boy, time travel is real, we got an A. - Boom! - I hope we get an A. - Great job, guys. Well, that was interesting. I think we've gone through just about everybody. So that leaves... Lydnsy, are you all set? - Thank you. I chose to do my project on the homelessness problems within our city. Just last year, there was approximately 11 thousand 883 people living in the risk of homelessness. This is obviously a hug problem for a lot of reasons. Many of these people can't find proper jobs. They struggle day in and day out to make ends meet. I need to, I need to be excused. - Hey! You can't be here! - What? - It's private property. - Where's Olga the Oracle? - Show was last night, sister. - I know but I really need... - You really can't be here. Hey, Igor, sometime today! Move it! - Lydnsy! I know you're in there. What the fuck is going on? Let me in now, please! Babe, what's going on? Why are you avoiding me? You gonna tell me what's going on? Come here. What's going on? Are you okay? You wanna tell me why you're not answering my calls or texts? Whatever it is you're going through, not matter what it is, we'll make it through, I promise. I didn't come here for this, babe, I'm sorry. - What? - What's happening to you? - What do you mean? - You're just different. - No I'm not, Kyle. It's just me. - I don't if I believe that. - No! - I can't do this, I'm sorry. - Kyle! Kyle! - They're coming to get you, Barbara. - Stop it! You're ignorant! - They're coming for you, Barbara. - Stop it! You're acting like a child! - They're coming for you! Look, here comes one of them now. - Are you tired of paying high rent? Are you tired of making your landlord rich? You deserve a methodical, beautiful new home. Call me, I have a deal for you. Debbie Philips at 555-7698. This key can be the key to your new home. A new life, your new home. - Good afternoon, Debbie Philips office. How can I help you? Certainly, yeah, we can book you in for a consultation with Debbie anytime. Debbie, honey, there's a walk-in over there looking to buy. - Hello, my name is Debbie Philips. Nice to meet you. Oh, okay. Would you like to come into my office and perhaps I can help you there. It's a work in progress but the view aint too bad. And what exactly were you looking for today? - What did you do to me? - Excuse me, I'm... Are you okay? - I came to see you a few weeks ago and you told me about my future. You said that there was a black mark above my head and that terrible things would happen. Why would you say that? - I'm not too sure what we're talking about here. I did nothing to you. You're gonna have to leave. Darryl! Darryl! - You have to help me. - I don't know what you think has happened. I did nothing to you. You're gonna have to leave. - Stop lying! - It's just something I do. It's a character. It's a joke, it's just in fun. I haven't done anything to you. - You have to help me, please! - I don't know if I can. - I can't keep going on like this. - If I do this, you have to promise to leave. - Do you really think that this will work? - I don't know. We're gonna give it a shot. - Can you? - What? - Can you do the accent please? - When you sought the future there was a black mark that rose above your soul. Doomed, a life of despair. I wash you of the curse. I ask your permission to give it to me as if it was yours to give. - Please, take this from me. - You have been cleansed of all of your woes. Take this mirror. Do not open your eyes until Olga tells you so you can see what Olga has done. And now you may open yours eyes to see what Olga has done for you. - It's me! I'm back. How much do I owe you? - Today, the future is free. - What'd you do with the hat? - I never want to talk about this again, Darryl. - Why not? It's a majestic hat for a majestic lady. - Goodnight, Darryl. - Okay. Have a goodnight, I can lock up. ♪ Counting points ♪ ♪ For their friends' parents that they knew ♪ ♪ Why won't you work, they said ♪ ♪ Not what we do ♪ - You okay over there, Frankie? - No, I gotta take a piss but I don't wanna go alone. Oh, fuck you guys. - Frankie's afraid of the dark. - Fuck off, Mike! - Bye! - Boo! - Oh, fuck! Jody, what're you doing? Fuck. - Relax, relax, it's just a joke. - Jesus. - So, how about Natalie? - What do you mean, how are things with Natalie? Nothing's going on with Natalie, that's the problem. - Well, if you'd stop being such a little bitch and step up to the plate. - Oh, I'm a little bitch? - Yeah, you're kinda being one. - No, no, no, no, I'm not gonna fucking go back to this stupid fucking fire with this stupid fucking book, this evil book full of human blood, all these sketches and drawings and bullshit. No, you know what? Fuck you and everything else that you're saying. I'm going to the camp and this is it. It's done, we're done. - Natalie did mention she was kinda hoping you guys might hook up tonight. - This one's called "Siren's Call." - Hello, friend. Welcome. - No. No sprechen... Netherlands. - Of course, of course. Welcome my friends. What can I help you with? - We're looking for a place to stay. This is the inn, right? - Of course. Weary travelers are always welcome at - Right. So we can grab a room then? - Yes, yes. This way, this way. Yah, yah. I have a double available with two bunk beds. Is that all right? - Sure, works for us. - Okay. Then let's get you signed in. - You got any pubs around here? - We do. Of the "Wobbly Pub" in English. It's right next door, actually. Thought it might not be exactly what you're looking for. So, where are you gentlemen coming from? - Michigan. - She speaks! - Michigan. Americans then. What brings you all the way to Delft? Maastricht is only an hour away. - We just came from there. We're hitchhiking to Amsterdam but our ride isn't leaving until the morning. - I see. Delft is a nice place to stay for the night. We might be small but we have a lot to offer. - I'm sure it does. - Yah. Here is your key. And let me show you to your room. This way. This way. - Thank you. Okay, I'm bored. - You're always bored. - Come on, we're not gonna stay in here all day, are we? - What else are we supposed to do? This town's a speak on the map. - So? Let's check it out. Get into some trouble. Have an adventure. Come on! - Hey! What the hell, man?! - I'm sick and tired of you texting Devon! We're supposed to be single on this trip. - Oh, I'm sorry I broke a pact we made two years ago. - That's not the point. We're supposed to be living the dream. Backpacking through Europe with each other. - Who's dream? 'Cause I'm pretty sure yours is just "Europe Trip" on repeat. - Come on, guys. - Listen, Sam and I have been living the dream. We've checked out ruins, castles, museums, festivals, hell, we've even tasted wine in Tuscany and beer in Munich. What more do you want? - I just want to bang whatever story I can tell people when I get back. Nobody gives a shit about castles. - No, you don't give a shit about castles! - And you don't give shit about anyone other than Devon! - You've really got a problem with him, don't you? - No, mu problem is with you! - All right, that's enough! Jeez. Let's get out of this place. Sitting in a hotel isn't gonna be any more fun than checking out what's around here. Okay? Come on. - Fuck. - You owe me a new phone. - Fuck you! - It's in very bad taste to touch another person's room set. That is why it's behind glass. For you to see and not touch. - I didn't know. - It's all right. They're out for people to be curious and ask questions. Now, what can I help you with? - Pub you were telling us about earlier. Is it open yet? - Yes. Okie dokie. Let's go! This way. This way. Come, sit. I will get you a round of ale. - This is pretty shit. - Hey. Hey, are you American? - Mind if we sit with you guys? Your English is way better than these people. - Come take a seat. - So, what brings you to the Netherlands? - The dream. - Graduation. - Oh. - Oh. - From what, like college? What program? - Electrical engineering. All three of us, actually. - We're in the same class. - Oh, congratulations. - Thanks. - Just the man I wanted to see. - I see you have met the Hills. This is, don't tell me. Sam. Jason. And Texas. Uuuh... Austin. - Hey. - Oh. I have something. I heard a strange ringing outside and found this. - Thank you. - I don't know who "Baby cakes" is but I fear he is dying without you. - Baby Cakes? Baby Cakes, seriously? What the fuck's he call you, "Snuggle Sammy?" - Hey! - You're not man enough to drink this. - I don't need to be man enough. - Give it back. - This is viking brew. How dare you insult their ancestors. - Oh, Viking. Whoa. That sounds, like, so romantic. - What? - Yeah, Sigurd was telling us some old legends before you guys got here. - Like what? - Oh, tales of viking raids and young love stories. - Love stories. I get enough love from her. Hey, Sig, why don't you tell us something a little more interesting? - And what would be more interesting to you, Mr. Briggs? - Something scary. Something violent. Do you have any cool viking ghosts laying around town? - No. Our ancestors feast in Valhalla. But... there is a rule in town. We do not enter the after dark. - Why? - If you do, you'll never return. - But why? - There are rumors, some say they are dark dwarves. Others say they are the children of Baba Yaga, or the doctors of the Goddess Hel. But everyone agrees, something lives in that forest. And it is out to kill. - What do you think it is? - Lorelei. - What's that? - Their name means "murmuring rock." Beautiful women who sing with even more beautiful voices. They live in the river and the lure those who enter the forest to their watery grave. - Drown people? Why? - Why do birds sing? Or snakes bite? It is in their nature. - So you really believe that there are evil women in the forest right now waiting to kill someone? - Why do you think we are now here at this time? There is strength in numbers. - Get up, get up, get up. - What the hell, man? - Get dressed, we're going. - What? - I'm going to check out the forest. Guys, we're going to the forest. - No. - Guys, come on, this is it. This is my story. If you go right now, I promise I will not ask for another adventure this whole trip. And I'll tell you how I landed Eric Spinner. Oh yeah. - How far do we have to walk? - Far enough until I can prove that the Loreleis are real. - Five minutes feels like 20. Are you kidding me? It's almost 3:30 already. - Weird, that's not the time. We've been walking for fifteen minutes already. - Oh great, so numb nits did break my phone. Wonderful! - Hello? Shit. - It's okay, we're not gonna hurt you. I mean it, we're not gonna hurt you. Are you okay? - I thought you were one of them. - One of who? - The evil that lingers in. - You mean the Lorelei? You saw them? - I heard them. I heard something. It's true! I don't know what the hell they were but they were chasing me. - Then where are they? - They must've stopped when I got on the path. - Maybe you should just stick with us then. We could all head back to town together. - Back to town? - Yes. Evil thing or not, this girl's scared and it's late. We should all turn back. Besides, you got your story. - The fuck I did! - You found a beautiful woman in the woods. What more do you want? - Fuck that! You found a beautiful woman in the woods. I'm going to get my fucking story. - Come on! Austin, stop! Fuck! I can't leave him to just walk around alone. Listen, it really is safer if you stick with us. I swear. We'll head up the trail with him until he's happy and we'll head back home. You'll be safe with us. - Fine but we need to stay on the path. - We'll stay on the path. Come on. - This is bullshit, I'm going back! - What?! - We've been at this for hours! Whatever Austin's looking for, he's not gonna find it in the fucking woods. - Sam. - No, I'm going! - Wait. Just let me... - I'll be fine. I'll take the path back. Really, it's not like there's any actual monsters in here. - Just go catch up with Austin and I'll be there in a second. There might not be any monsters but there's still animals. - Have we seen any? Exactly! I'll be fine. So you go hit on your new girlfriend and I'll go talk to my boyfriend. - Fine, fine. Then I'll catch you when we get back then. - Yeah, so like noon, right? - Yeah, yeah. - See you then. - Cool. - See ya. - See ya. - Jason? Austin? Austin, I swear to God if you're trying to scare me I'm gonna break your legs! - Sam. - Who? Jesus. You scared me. I was just following... Wait! Where are you going? I shouldn't be doing this. - So how do you know these two anyway? - Well, Austin I've known since my first year at MUS. Sam, I met in our final year. I'm Jason, by the way. I didn't get your name. - Halldora. - Halldora. Whoa, that's an interesting name for someone without an accent. - My family's from the Netherlands. - And you're not? - What is he looking at anyway? - Sam and I have had great years. I mean, phenomenal years. Both of us top of our classes, great catches, job offers before graduation. Austin? - Not so much? - Yeah. I think he's hoping to find his glory here in Europe and just didn't live up... - Sam?! What the fuck?! - Sam?! Sam! - No, it's a trap! - What? - The Lorelei, they're luring us off the path. - That's ridiculous. - Think about it. Your friend went back towards town. How do you think her phone got here? - Sam?! Sam?! - Stop yelling, they might hear us. We need to split up. Jason and I are gonna head back towards town to see if she's still on the path. You go forward and see if she's messing with us. - Yes sir, El Capitan! - You think that was a good idea? - No but it was the only idea I had. - Oh yeah. Oh yeah. - Sam? Sam?! Sam?! Fuck. Sam! Sam! Halldora? Halldora! Fuck, Halldora. Halldora, what the hell you doing? We have to get back. What? - I warned you... of the evil. Forget your friends. Will you stay with me? - Whatever. - Did you enjoy your sacrifices? - Yes, we always do under your care, Sigurd. Inga and Katla are very happy. They'd like to give you another gift. Perhaps something to go with your rooms. - I need no gift. - Not even the flowers I bring you. - Only because they remind me of you, my darling. - The sun is coming. - I will have another sacrifice for you tomorrow night, another set of Americans. - Go then. The more we eat, the more I get to see you. - Of course, anything for you, my darling. - Nice job. - Well, I'm gonna go get us some more firewood. - All right. - Michael, wanna join me? - What? - Michael! - No! - Oh yeah. Yeah. All right, guys, see ya. - We'll be right back. - Do you wanna read one more before they get back? - Yeah, you can. - Okay. This one's called "Summer Camp." - Nope, no, no. No, pick another one. - Oh, come on, it's perfect. Just listen. "Four summer camp counselors out in the woods "reading from the book that ruins childhoods. "They're lost out there, alone and exposed, "where they'll end up tonight, God only knows." - What? - "They better start running, she's coming for blood. "In a flurry of crimson, "the forest will food." That was Jody! - What do you think happened to her? - Oh my God! - Oh, fuck, where is she? - Jody! - Jody! - Mike! - Mike! Hold on, Natalie, she's over here. I can hear her. Natalie, holy fuck. Jody! - Jody? - Oh my God. Okay, we need to get help. - Jody, what happened? Frank, what're we gonna do? - It's okay. - It's not okay, Frank. - What is this? This isn't a game. Where is Mike? - He's right here, he's happy to see you. The book was mine. You should've let me hold on to it. - Stacey, did you do this? - Come on, you've read the stories. You're all having so much fun. - This is fucked. This is so fucked. - Thank you, Frank, for your eloquence. Very perceptive of you. - No. - It was all just in good fun. - No. - Well, I didn't realize it was all in good fun. Well, you're good to go then. Sorry about your friends and all the killing. - Are you serious? - Fuck no, Frank! Unfortunately, we're gonna have to kill you too. - Run! Let's go this way. Maybe we lost her. You okay? - Just let us go. - Stacey, please. - Let us go! - Please. - Excuse me, are you a counselor here? - Yeah, I am. - Hi, my name's Clint Burrell. I'm looking for my son, Dwayne, have you seen him? - Dwayne. Dwayne. - Yeah, he's been here three weeks. You should know him. Do you not know all the kids that are here? - I'm sorry, sir, he's not on this list. - What? What do you mean he's not on this list? He's been here for three weeks. What kind of Mickey Mouse outfit is this? You should have his name on that list. - Sir, it's my first summertime working here and I'm trying to do my best. - Excuse me, I'm looking for my daughter. Stacey Smith. - Yeah, cabin five. - Oh. - How can you know where her daughter is but you don't know where my son is? Who else can I speak to who might know where my son is? - Everyone else is at the camp getting the kids ready right now. You can come with me right now. - Yes, I'll come with you. You show me, I'm not happy about this. - It's just awful, isn't it? I do hope they find those poor souls. - They can't have gotten very far. The search party's been out all over the property. - I'm just happy our girls are safe, don't you think? - I try not to. - I'm gonna have to find a new summer camp for Stacey for next year. - Michael! Jody! - Natalie! - Seatbelt, eh. What you got there? Stacey? - Hmmmm? Oh, it's just a book.
