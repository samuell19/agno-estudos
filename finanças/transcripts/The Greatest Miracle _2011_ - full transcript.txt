(playful music) - [Maid] Hurry up, Tonio, I'm starting to get worried. - Relax, she's probably still sleeping. - Then who turned on the music? Dona Cata? It's Trini, are you okay? I told you, Tonio. - Well, then, maybe she's taking a shower. Knock again. Dona Cata? Your breakfast is ready. Dona Cata. - Okay, now I'm really worried. Think we should call her daughter? - Now, let's not worry her just quite yet. Especially not with how busy she's been lately. You know what? I'm sure she just went to eight o'clock mass and forgot to turn her music off. She'll be back in no time. - So, why did she lock the door, then? - Well, that I don't know. - Come on, Tonio. Why don't you see if you can find the key? Or call the locksmith? - No, I'll just go out to the garden and knock on her window. - I hope you'll be able to see her. I bet her curtains have already been drawn by now. - I hope she doesn't think I'm a peeping Tom. If she gets mad it was your idea, Trinidad. - Yes, yes, I know that. Just hurry up and check. ♪ Wherever I go ♪ Far away and anywhere ♪ Time after time you always shine ♪ Through dark of night calling after me ♪ And wherever I climb ♪ Far away and anywhere ♪ You raise me high beyond the sky ♪ Through stormy night lifting me above ♪ Venite Spiritu et emitte caelitus ♪ Venite Spiritu et emitte caelitus ♪ Venite Spiritu Venite Spiritus ♪ Far away beyond the sky (video game beeping) - Diego? Diego! - What? - Seen my keys, anywhere? - Huh? - I said, have you seen my keys anywhere? Can you stop and listen to me for just a sec? - What'll you give me if I find them? - Nothing. Listen, I'm running late and I have to finish my proposal. Just help me find them. - You're going to work again today? But you promised you'd take me to the sports club. - I'm sorry, sweetie, I don't think we'll be able to go. My boss called to tell me that the meeting was pushed up to Monday. I'm afraid I won't be ready for it, unless I go to the office today. - I'll go with you and we can go to the club after. - Not today, honey. I really need to concentrate on my proposal. I owe you one. Now, please, help me find those keys. - But you made a promise to me, mom. Besides, it's Saturday, no one works today. - Well, I have to. I don't like it but I gotta go. I've told you before. All right, tomorrow, if you want, we can go for a little while before grandma's. Right now, just help me find my keys. I'm really late, okay? - Tomorrow? (grunts) What's the point? You don't even remember that the swim meet was today, do you? I told you about it two weeks ago. You never listen to me. - Not today, Diego. Don't even start with this. I've got a lot of work to do. I'm under a lot of pressure and we need the money. You need to learn there are much more important things than your swimming meet. - Everything is more important to you. Dad, worked a lot, too, and he would've taken me. - Diego, your father isn't alive anymore. I'm the one that's here. I'm sorry, sweetie, I miss your daddy, too. But, if I lose this job, we're gonna have to face even bigger problems. I promise it won't happen again, okay? All right, seriously now, where are my keys? - You dropped them there yesterday. - Look, when I get back we'll make some popcorn and you can pick the movie. But, no scary ones, okay? (sniffling) (crying) (gears grind) (phone rings) (woman gasps) - Look out! (horn honks) (tires screech) - Ditzy lady, watch where you're going? - Why don't you learn to drive, fool? - Ah. Kris? Hello? Oh, why can't I hear her? Kristina? How's Manuel doing? What did they say? Hold on a sec, hold on. I'll pull over. - Come on, get moving. - Have they given you the test results? Okay, then, what did the doctor tell you? - [Man] Hello? - Come on, drive. - So? No, in layman's terms, Kristina, come on. - Seriously. - Excuse me, please? - Well, are you sure? - Oh, my god. No, no, don't cry, please, sweetie. Your brother's a strong guy. (chuckles) Listen, you'll see. He's so stubborn, he won't be leaving us for a long time. Is he awake? Give him a little kiss from me, even if it annoys him. No, no, no, don't say anything to your mother just yet. And thanks for taking care of him. As soon as I finish, I'll come over there right away. I'll see you soon, honey. Hmm? Oh, I love you, too. (crying) - Come on, man. - Hey, what's going on? - Everyone out. Come on, move it. This is the last stop. (people complaining) You can take your money back. Have a good day. - [Man] This has ruined my day. - [Woman] You're a bad driver. - [Man] I'm gonna report you. (sobbing) - You promised me, Fernando. (crying) I don't think I can do this alone. - Wash your window. - No, no, no, thank you. That's okay. - Don't worry about it, ma'am. You'll see much better this way. - But, I don't have any change. - Just give it to me next time. Is everything okay, ma'am? - Yes, thank you. Let me see if I have any change around here. - No, don't worry about it. This one will be on me. - No, no, are you kidding? I've got to have something here, hold on. - Seriously, are you sure you're okay? Is there anything I can do to help? - No, thank you, honestly. It's just been one of those days. - There will be days like that, I know. - I know I'll get over it, I'm fine. - Know what? Sometimes the world doesn't let us see things clearly. - Huh? - Sometimes we trick ourselves into believing things but really the answers are right there in front of us. - Ah, there, I knew I had some change. Thanks again. I feel better. You have a nice day. - At least your windshield's all clean. Now, you'll be able to see things very clearly. (sniffling) (faint rock music) - Hey, you. Hello? Have you heard a word I've said? - Sorry, no, I didn't - Everyone got off. This bus is out of service. - Aw, okay. Something wrong, mister? - No, nothing's wrong. - All right, go on, kid. - Just tell me. I've got the time. Seriously, tell me what's up. - Nothing, I'm fine. Just get off or I'm gonna lose my temper. - You're gonna break down if you hold it in. Come on, you can tell me. - Why should I tell you? Go on. I said get off, already. - All right, all right, man. I'll get off. Someone's grumpy. Just trying to help. - You can help by getting off the bus. Here's your money. - You know what? Sometimes you have to share your pain with someone to truly understand it. - What'd you say? - That sometimes you have to open a door in order to find your answer. - How would you know that? Come on, hurry up. (soft music) (pigeons coo) (bell tolling) (pigeon coos) - Can I help you with anything, ma'am? - I don't know. - Are you here by yourself? - Actually, I just snuck out. They don't like it when I'm out alone. - Why aren't you going inside? Mass is about to start in a minute. - I woke up early this morning and had a tremendous feeling I needed to come here. - Well, you're here just in time. Thank you. (grand music) (crying) - [Boy] Make sure to dry 'em well, ma'am. So, you can clearly see what's about to happen. - You? How long have you been here? - As long as you have. - You're not following me, are you? - I just want to help. - All right, yeah, yeah, okay. Just let me pray right now. - Brothers and sisters, please call your sins to mind. - Ask for the Lord's forgiveness from the bottom of your heart. From the depths of your soul, ask for His forgiveness. - But I just went to confession last night. I haven't offended God, have I? - [Priest] Father, You are holy indeed and all creation rightly gives You praise. All love, all holiness comes from You through Your son Jesus-Christ, our Lord, by the working of the Holy Spirit. - Honestly, do you think you're prepared to receive Him? - [Priest] From age to age You gather a people to Yourself so that from east to west, a perfect offering may be made to the glory... - Ditzy lady, watch where you're going! - Why don't you learn to drive, fool? - Everything is more important to you. Dad worked a lot, too, but he would've taken me. - Diego, your father isn't alive anymore. I'm the one that's here. - You'll never be alone. I'll always be here by your side. (coughing) - Fernando. Fernando! I need a nurse! - Are you all right, miss? - I'm fine. (baby cooing) - Why are they always getting here at the last minute? - Who's that? - They need to get here earlier, prepare themselves, leave their worries and troubles behind. And they're not even paying attention. Each mass is a new miracle every time. It's the greatest gift that God could have ever given us. So, again, are you ready to receive Him? - Oh, now I see. (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (phone rings) - They won't allow it. - My, god, you scared me, kid. What won't they allow? - For him to be forgiven. That's why they're keeping him away. They distract him. - What in devil's name are you doing here, anyway? - Devils, you say? Why don't you look again? - [Bus Driver] It looks like it hurts them to be inside a church. - It does. But they do it in order to distract us. - Look at that outfit. (laughing) (dramatic music) (phone buzzing) - What was that? - He is distracted, impatient. He isn't ready for confession. - And what are those creatures? - They've been there the whole time. So, we have to always be prepared for them. There, look again. (ominous music) (triumphant music) - [Bus Driver] But, they're not going near her. - [Boy] Yes, but they won't give up so easy. - What is this? Who are you people? - We're guardians. - Of what? - Of souls. - [Priest] Glory to God in the highest and on earth. - You can do this. Say it with strength from the soul. You are His creation. - Lord, God, Heavenly King, Almighty God and Father, we worship you. We give you thanks and praise you. - Our Heavenly God, Lord Almighty, Son of the Father, Lord Jesus-Christ. - Lord God, Lamb of God, You take sin from the world. (knocks on window) - Dona Cata? Whoa! (struggling) (yells) (crashes down) - Oh, sweet Virgin Mary, please let Dona Cata be all right. (Tonio groaning) What happened? Where is she? - I wasn't able to see a thing. The drapes were drawn but I couldn't get a good look. It was pretty dark in there. - Oh, now I'm really worried. That's it, go call the locksmith. - But what if she just went to mass? - I'll tell her when she gets back that I freaked out and made you bring him. Just hurry. I don't care if she scolds me. - All right, then. I won't be too long. What else do I have to do today. Climb a ladder, falling. - [Priest] Lord God, Lamb of God, You take away the sin of the world. Have mercy on us. - Hail purest Mary. - Conceived without sin. - How long since your last confession, my child. - It's been three months, father. - May the Lord be in your heart so you can repent and humbly confess all your sins. Now, tell me your sins. - Oh, father. I don't know where to begin. I've been lying to my husband and I haven't been able to help my son and I also cover for him. I don't want his father to go after him but I know he's still involved with the wrong crowd. I think (sighs), I think he's into drugs. My husband, Juan, he just doesn't know how to approach him. I feel so alone, father, and without support. I feel desperate and I get angry. I don't see how things can get better. Oh, father, I feel such despair. I don't know what to do. I think I've lost my faith, father. I feel like it'll never change. And... (sobbing) - Your faith will save you, My child. You can always reclaim it. Just open your heart. You will see that the light of God is inside you. (crying) And don't worry about your son, just leave him in My hands and My will will be done. Now, go, and sin no more. - Repeat the Act of Contrition. I absolve in the name of the Father, the Son, and Holy Spirit. Now, go in peace. - Jesus was with me. He is alive. - You are seated at the right hand of the Father. Have mercy on us, for You alone are the Holy One. You alone are the Lord. You alone are the Most High, Jesus-Christ, with the Holy Spirit in the glory of God the Father. - Dear brother, remember always that Jesus-Christ was raised from the dead according to my gospel, for which I suffer, even to the point of being chained but the word of God is not chained. Therefore, I endure all things for the sake of the elect. - But why me? - It's because you needed it. - It's because I have too many doubts. I don't know what to do. - Just try to listen. Sometimes it's within a prayer, but other times it's just a few phrases. The word of God always leaves something behind, you just have to be able to hear it. - He cannot deny himself, these things you must teach, warn them all before God to avoid quarreling over words. It is worth nothing, and leads them to perdition. Do your best to present yourself to God as an impeccable worker, who need not be ashamed and who faithfully preaches truth. This is the word of the Lord. - Thanks be to God. (singing in Latin) - A reading from the holy gospel according to Saint Luke. In the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth, to a virgin engaged to a man of the house of David, whose name was Joseph. The virgin's name was Mary. And having come in, the angel said to her, "Rejoice, highly favored one, the Lord is with you. "Blessed are you among women." But when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and considered what manner of greeting this was. - If you only knew the truth, the gospels gave you eternal life, you would change your attitude. - And can it do the same thing for my son? Can it keep him from dying? - It can and more. - [Priest] Elizabeth, your relative, has also conceived a son in her old age and this is now the sixth month for her who was called barren. - Don't listen just to be polite, you listen so you can learn, so you can deeply live what Jesus-Christ wants to tell you. I guarantee if you just listen, you'll find peace and you'll feel happy. - Don't you think that's a little naive for a guardian? - The word of God does not come without giving fruit, you'll see. - The gospel of the Lord. - Don't forget to get Rodrigo and take him to his dentist appointment, okay? At four o'clock. Trini! (gasps) Because I have to take Sophie to cheerleading practice, and then to the accountant, then pick up Rafiki from the univer-- Trinidad! - Oh my goodness! What do I do now? Dona Cata, your daughter is home now. Come on answer me! - Did you eat breakfast? Oh, sorry, I rushed out so I didn't even check if we had any eggs. Well, I kept having the strangest dreams about her all throughout the night, so I just wanna pay her a little visit. Okay, I'll tell her that. Yeah I'm just gonna have breakfast with her and then I'll come home, okay? I love you, bye! Hey, are you hard of hearing already? (laughs nervously) Oh, Trini, well why are you just standing there? - I'm so glad you came Mrs. Jose. It's just, your mother won't open up, but her breakfast is ready. We knocked and got no response and, well, now I'm worried. - It's alright Trini, anyway where's Tonio? - Well, since she wouldn't open, I sent him out to get a locksmith. - No reason to worry Trini, seriously, she used to do this all the time. She'd say it was the only way she could be alone. She'd turn the music up, so it'd seem like she was here and she'd sneak out and go to mass. - Why would she lock the door then? - Well she is getting old now, things like this are just becoming sort of a habit. Ever since Santiago broke her vase, she locks everything when she leaves, but I am glad you sent for the locksmith, I needed a set of keys. Anyway Trini, could you pour me a cup of coffee? I haven't had breakfast. - Right away, Mrs. Jose. - Mother! Mama! - Amongst all His creation, God chose one woman, Mary. So she could be His ark of the new covenant with humanity, so she could carry our savior in her womb. Thanks to this, she became the most blessed of all God's living creatures, the full of grace, the preferred one, our mother, in whom all God's promises are fulfilled. Let's try to imagine the enormous commitment, responsibility and sacrifice, that Mary acquired with her acceptance, the world's greatest mission. To be the mother of the Messiah, of our Savior, we all know the power of prayer, and we know that God listens to our prayers. Now imagine the fruit our prayers can bring when they are made for us by our Holy Mother to her own Son. Seek her, speak to her, she always listens. Surrender to her motherly love. - I've never been good at asking. - But she knows, and she'll listen. Tell her whatever want. Don't be afraid. She is your mother, and she's here for you. - Could you please help him, mother? You're his mother, you understand, I'm begging you. - Open up your hands. At last. (gasps) - Who are you? What is this? - It's your petition and your offering. - I don't understand. - It's the offering, now we can take your petition and your offerings to the Lord. (majestic music) (choir singing) - What's going on here? Are those angels? - Yes we are, one for each of you. - So than it's true, guardian angels really do exist. What's that they're carrying? - Your petitions and your offerings. - And them, why aren't they carrying any? - Because the people they protect don't have anything to ask for. They didn't pay attention during the mass, or even worse, they compromised and came against their own will. Forced, just to oblige. Those people don't have anything to offer God. - That's why they're so sad. So, can anything be done for them? - Pray for them. Listen. - Now what are they doing? - They pray for them directly to God. Their voice is the offering that raises over the earth until it can reach and be heard by our Lord. - So, what is there that I can offer the Lord? - Yourself, your work, your joy, your sadness and your son's well being, your life and all your service. We always forget to offer something to God and we don't even know how to plead. - So, how is it done? - Ask him in silence for what you want the most, for all your heart's desires. Very good, now pray for other people, pray for your son, For Fernando, pray for your parents and family. Don't stop, go on, pray for world peace, for sinners, for our priests and their missions. Pray to God, but not only for yourself, but for those who need it, the most. And now with all of your soul, make your offering to our Lord. It is ready for our Father. (inspiring music) - I can't believe I just saw that. - That's just the problem, you all need to see to believe. Even though God's love is right in front of your nose. You forget Him, just because you don't see Him. - So, why am I seeing this today? - Open your eyes and completely pay attention, because what you witness here today, you must tell all of humanity. Now prepare yourself and be completely silent. - Holy, holy, holy, Lord, God of power and might. Heaven and earth are full of Your glory, hosanna in the highest. (choir singing) Blessed is he, who comes in the name of the Lord, hosanna in the highest. - Never is a man a truer man, than when he kneels before God. - Who are those people? - Those are all the saints and blessed souls from heaven. Over there are the souls of your relatives who are already with God. - Oh, my goodness! He must be among them. Fernando! (gasps) (intense music) Hey, help me, please! - Don't worry, they won't hurt you. - Who are they? - Those are souls from purgatory, they only want your help. - Poor things, what are they saying? - They pray for you, since they can't pray for themselves. - Why not? - They need people to pray for them, so they can be set free and return to God. - I miss you, Fer. - I love you, my love. You've been really courageous. - I don't think I can do it. I need you so much. - God is always here with you and so am I. - So, I'm not, so, I'm not going crazy. Sometimes it feels like you're there. - Everyday, I pray to our guardian angel to look over you. And when you sleep, God blesses you for your effort. You've done such an amazing job with Diego. I'm so proud of you both. - But, I need you, Fernando. Please don't go away. - I will always be right here with you and Diego. Jesus is a living God. He is always here with us. Surrender yourself and let Him act and trust in Him. (gentle music) - Your petition has been received. She is here and she's listening. - Oh, please, don't play with me. - I'm not playing. She would like to see you. - So, where is she? I don't see her. - You couldn't see her all those hard years of sacrifice when you worked three shifts to help pay for Manuel's career, but she was there with you. - She was? - You also didn't see her when your son was diagnosed with cancer. But she cried with you that night. - He just wanted to help with others. They were experimenting with new forms of radiation treatment. How was he to know that his own cure would make him sicker? It's not fair. - And she's even here with you today, comforting you as a mother does. The priest has a special kind of dignity. It has nothing to do with the love of a mother and son. - I'm sorry. I'm just begging here for my son. - Well, first, come with me. - It's not fair, mother, Manuel just wanted to help other people. Why does he have to die? - You are holy indeed, Lord. Fountain of all holiness. Let Your Holy Spirit come upon these gifts to make them holy. So that they may become, for us, the body and the blood of our Lord Jesus-Christ. - Don't lower your eyes, look up. Contemplate Him. He is the King of kings. In the same way, when the supper was ended, I took the cup. Again, I gave you thanks and praise. Gave the cup to my disciples and said, "Take this, all of you, and drink from it. For this is the cup of my blood. (somber music) (thunder rumbles) - Oh, God. My God. (crying) (angelic music) My God. (sobbing) (phone buzzing) Thank you, Holy Mother. (crying) - You see? Sometimes pain is something that has to be shared so that you can understand it. - Brethren, let us pray with confidence to the Father in the words our savior, Jesus-Christ, gave us. - [All] Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debt as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power, the glory Forever and ever, amen. - Lord, I offer up this communion together with the mass that's celebrated today in the name of the holy souls in purgatory. - The peace of the Lord be with you always. - [Woman] And also with you. - Let us offer each other a sign of peace. The body of Christ. - Now, observe, Jesus is pleased. That is a pure soul. (triumphant music) - The body of Christ. - Amen. - The body of Christ. - Amen. - Jesus wants to stay with everyone until the end of time because His love for you can't allow Him to make orphans of those you love most. Listen. - [Woman Voiceover] Lord, it's already the end of the month and I don't have money to pay the rent, nor the car payment, nor Juan's tuition. If I don't pay, he can't take the exams so, please do not forsake me, Lord. - [Man Voiceover] Help me get the raise. Why should Jimenez get it? He doesn't even have kids. Oh, I just remembered my neighbor, make her move away. I can't stand her. - [Woman Voiceover] Please, make my husband stop drinking so much. He loses control and ends up beating Eleazar. - Did you notice? Not a single one of them gave thanks, just a long string of requests. That's how it is with most who come to His house. If they only knew how much He loves them and how much He would like to be loved. - So, what can I do? - Well, start with your son. Show him how to value the sacrifice of Jesus. Bring him to our mass and teach him to come joyfully. Share everything from today with whoever you can. Not even us angels can eat of the heavenly bread. Only you have that special grace as God's children. - If other people could witness what I saw today, everything would be so different. - Heavenly Father, You who have fed us with the body and blood of Your son, guide us through the Holy Spirit so that not only with our words but with all of our life we can demonstrate our love to You and be able to join Your kingdom. You who live and reign forever and ever, amen. Filled with joy, we may go in peace. Our mass has concluded. - Thanks be to God. - Don't scribble with that hand. Receive the blessing gratefully and make the sign of the cross with respect. - Yes, yes, of course, you're right. It's just that I'm so happy. - How long does Jesus stay with me after receiving communion? - As long as you want him to. He will make your heart His home. You are the ones who let go. You leave the church and forget the great miracle you bare inside. - Can you tell me your name? - You call my name every night you pray with Diego. - What's that for? - In case I don't see you again. - I'm with you everywhere. Remember, I'm your guardian angel. - Thank you. I will follow your advice. - Don't rush away from church. Talk to Him. He likes it especially when you talk to Him. - Thank you, honestly, thank you so much. Will I be seeing you again? - We'll see each other everywhere. I'm always by your side. (inspirational music) - Diego. I'm home, my love. Are you ready? - And, please, dear God, I pray that my mom stops being so angry all day and that she doesn't have so many problems at her work. And that she's happier so we can finally spend more time together. Angel of God, my guardian dear, to whom God's love commits me here. - [Both Together] 'Til in the loving arms of Jesus, Mary, Joseph, I may stay. - Amen. Now, grab your stuff and let's go to the club. - Are you sure? You don't have any work to do? - It will keep, Diego. - Yippee! Woo-hoo! (mom laughs) - Is everything okay, ma'am? - I don't know. I honestly don't know. - Is there a problem? - No, actually, there isn't. - So, what then? - Well, what do you want me to do? - Open the door, you dope. - Trini. - The door isn't even locked. - That can't be right. - Of course, it's locked. Tonio and I tried to-- - [Both] Huh? - Huh? - Dona Cata? - Mama? Mother? - Trini, check in the bathroom, please. - [Trini] Right away. Dona Cata? - They're going to be worried about you. - You're probably right. But I feel like I should stay here. - What makes you say that? - Would you listen to an old lady? - I'm all ears. - All of my life, I've done what I was supposed to do. I've tried my hardest to be a good daughter and a good mother. And then I met Miguel. So handsome, he was. I never imagined how hard it would be to lose Miguel. However, none of my children ever lacked anything. I feel I was a good mother and they've been good children. - So, what, then? You should be very happy and go back to your children. - Oh, but, what for? - What do you mean, "What for?" - No, no, no, don't misunderstand me. I love them with all of my heart but it has been for several years now that I feel I'm just getting in the way. - There's no one in here. - I told you, she went to mass. Where did you leave that sweet smile, my Catalina. - I've had a happy life. But now I can hardly find peace and my age has taken my independence. You see, I even have to sneak away. And now, basically, I just survive without knowing where to go. - Well, you've come to the right place. - You really should scold her this time so she doesn't scare us like this again. Oh, my, goodness. (gasps) Dona Cata. Mrs. Jose, Dona Cata. (crying) - No. Rest in peace, my dear sweet mother. I'm going to miss you. - I'm scared. - Don't worry, ma'am. Because you are one who is pure of heart. And God shines his love on the pure of heart.
