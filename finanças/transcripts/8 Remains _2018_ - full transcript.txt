- The departed don't hear us, Talli. - I wish I were dead instead. How is this possible? - Talli? Open the door, please. Oh... Mom? Mom! Hey, help! I need your help! You, hey, can you call the police? Help! I don't want to die. You can see me? - Happy birthday. Damian will be here any second. He told me that I should send you to your room. - My room? - Yes. He prepared his favorite room for you. Just for your birthday. Damian told me you were a vegetarian. I prepared a menu. I was just about to give it the final touch, and when it's ready, I'll get it up to the room. - Listen... You have to call the police. Damian wants to kill me. - Do you like ice cream or chocolate souffle as dessert? - Are you listening? - You can tell me later when I bring the main course. - He offed me! - Take one of these. They are delicious. - I want you to call the police! - You're welcome. Here you go. We had a short circuit that was killing the power in some of the rooms last week. We're still waiting for the contractor. - Yeah, I know. - If you need anything else, don't hesitate to call for me. But I'm pretty sure you will have a wonderful evening. Right? - Don't go in there, it's a trap! He wants to kill you! - Ready or not, here I come. I've been looking forward to this all day. - Shit! - I brought you something, a present. - You brought me something? - Of course darling, it's your birthday. Here. I hope you like it. - You're going to kill me. I have so much been looking forward to this. Well now finally, here we are. Together. Come on baby, come on. This way. Wear it for me. You have no idea how beautiful you are. Steamy. The tank top and the hot pants are nice, too. - Talli! - Don't. - Maybe it's Ann, maybe it's important. - Yeah, well maybe, maybe she's just jealous, huh? Maybe... It's because you're so cute. Maybe it's because you're smart. Or, maybe it's because you have me. - Yeah, I know, but maybe-- - No. No but. These girls treat you like shit all the time. You call them friends? They weren't there when you most needed them. You gotta set priorities, Talli. Do you really want to jump every time they call you for some shit, or would you rather just kiss me? - What if it's my mom? - Oh, come on. It's just the same. She calls when she wants you to run some errands for her. Hey, seriously, you gotta face it, Talli. She forgot your last birthday, she'll sure as hell forget your next. - She won't forget our birthday. - But I'm here. I am here for you, always. If you need anything, I'm here, hmm? They are not, not your mother, not your friends. They don't understand the pain of losing a child. They don't know what you're going through. But I do. I completely understand your loss. I know exactly how you feel. My son would have been five tomorrow, if he'd survived the chemo. - I should have known. The bastard was lying. You're right. I'm sorry. You're not mad at me, are you? - No. I have to say, although I'm a bit disappointed in you. I think I know something you can do about that. - Great, now he gets exactly what he wanted. That liar! And you don't even fight. But you can't blame him that you shut everyone out. Mom, our friends, you knew he was playing you. You really wanna be dead, don't you? No responsibility, huh? I want the old Talli back, just for once. Please come back. Please come back. You? You're in prison. - What do you think this is, sweetie? You of all people should know. You look older than I remember you. - Help me... - You brat. You made them lock me up. Confess that you lied, I never touched you. I never abused you. - I've seen mother's face when you were done with her! - Maybe. But I never laid a hand on you. - Aren't you even aware of what you did to her? Do you know how often she was crying because of you? It took her years to get over father, and then you, of all men, you were the first one she fell in love with. She trusted you, and you beat her, and raped her. - Maybe, but I never touched you. What do you think they do to people like that in prison, huh? I'm in prison, because you lied. Let me make it worth the lie, then at least I know why I'm here. You fucking... You dirty bitch! Fuck! - That's for betraying mother. You won't break me. - You think so? - I will break you! And you know what? It'll be the best moment of my life! - We're all alone. - No one will hear you. I'll do it slowly, very slowly. - He'll do the same to you as I did to your mother. She didn't want to listen either, just like you. I'm not done with you yet. - Yes, you are. - Was it a dream? That can't be... Talli? Your name's Talli, right? Actually Talita, but everyone calls you Talli? My name's also Talita, but everyone calls me Talli. Your mom promised to pick you up, but she didn't come, right? She's fighting with your stepfather. Don't be afraid. When I was your age, I also waited for my mom one day and thought she wouldn't come. But she did, she was just late. ♪ Hush my darling, night has come ♪ ♪ And the sun is going home ♪ ♪ The stars, they whisper lullabies ♪ ♪ From a land yet unknown ♪ Mom? Everything will be all right. Run! Talli, you need to run away! Fight, or he'll kill-- - Oops. - Show me your face! Don't worry, I won't let him get you. - Come on, you're not getting away, sweetie. ♪ Hush my darling, night has come ♪ ♪ The sun is going home ♪ ♪ The stars, they whisper lullabies ♪ ♪ From a land yet unknown ♪ I have an offer for you, Talita. Give me the girl. Give me the girl and I'll let you live, but you have to give her to me now. It wasn't nice to kick me like you did. Look at the bright side, sweetie. You'll meet your dead baby when I'm done with you. Hey, call me an optimist, but that's quite something, eh? But you're just gonna lose it anyway, huh? Bet you didn't want it. Runs in the family. Your mother didn't want you. Yeah, that's the reason why you lost it. How often did you hear your precious mother tell your stepfather she wishes you were never born, huh? I think you should thank me for bringing you two back together. Talita? Talita, come on out. I'm giving you a chance to make up for it. See your death as your reparation. Talita, come on out! - Run. - I'll bring you peace, I promise. For God's sake, stop running! - The door! Give her back! - You know what? Just play with your teddy bear, huh? The grown-ups need to talk. - You want me, not her! - But she is you, darling. - Give her back to me! - I will end you. - You won't, and you won't hurt her either! - I made my offer, and you declined. Almost tragic, don't you think? That didn't work out quite the way you expected, did it? Oh, how I'll kill her? I dunno, um, I think I'll enjoy it. I'll do it slowly, yeah. - Don't touch her! - Oh darling, no need to be jealous. You'll be next, sweetie. - Turn around, run away! Don't trust him! Run! - Come on, sweetie. - Julia? You're dead... What is this? All right, listen. There's a man upstairs who kidnapped a little girl. He will kill her. We need to help her, do you understand? Can you just stop eating for a moment and listen to me? This guy will kill the girl! Julia, you have to help me! All right, get up. Get up, you have to help me. You've got to save the girl, we need to save me! Please, Julia, I need your help. I can't do this on my own. Once we're out the door, we talk. I explain everything, okay? I promise, okay? I'm on my own, huh? That's just great. Why won't you open? I don't care how long it'll take, I won't give up, you hear me? I'll save you! I'll save you. Just hang in there... Julia? Is this how it happened? How you died? Why didn't you talk to me? - I didn't want to bother you. - So you just went and killed yourself? - Was it hard on my parents? - It was. For all of us. - I'm sorry. - There is no way we get the pills out of you now? I've been asking myself if there is anything I could have done differently. - No. Actually, I wish I would have asked for your help. I just... I didn't. - You'll always be my best friend. Why are you here? What is it that you want from me? - Talli, open up. Doesn't matter how far you run, I'll get you. You can't hide from me. Open the goddamn door! - Stop! - Hey. What are you doing here? Shh. What is it? - He won't stop. - What? - The banging, don't you hear it? He's after me, he wants to kill me. You don't hear the banging? Tell me that you hear it too. - Babe, I don't know what you're talking about. I just heard my mum open the door for you downstairs. And the next moment, you literally stormed into my bedroom. - No, no, it wasn't like that. This isn't real, this is a dream. This isn't real. Nothing here is real. I can't do this again. - What are you talking about? Babe, is this about us? Let's talk about it. - No, no, I can't go through this again. Don't you get it? It won't change a thing. I can't just go back to the way things were. - Babe, I-I know you suffer. Jeez, look, I feel terrible about it myself, but we're not to blame for what happened. Come here, let's sit down. - None of this is real. You aren't real. Nothing here is real! What's next, huh? Tell me! What else can you show me? Do I really have to go through this hell again? ♪ All I ever wanted was just the freedom to breathe ♪ ♪ All I ever wanted was a place ♪ - That's our song. - I know that, you don't have to remind me. Please, not again... Please, not again. - I love you. I'll always love you. I know if we stick together, if we help each other, we can start over, we can heal. You and me. You're Bonnie, I'm Clyde. - Stop. - What do you expect of me then? You don't call, you won't pick up your phone. Your mother promises that she'll forward my messages. But you don't even have time for her anymore, do you? - "Bonnie and Clyde". It's over. I'm done. It hurts to see you. He had your eyes. Stop! Don't open it. - Don't worry, it's only my mum. - No! It's what he wants. He'll kill you, then he'll come after me. - It's gonna be all right. ♪ Bonnie and Clyde ♪ ♪ There's no one, no one by our side ♪ - Run! Why can't you run? - I need a second chance... Oh my God. Alex? - Help me... Please make it stop... Please... - You feel better now? You better not make me regret that I saved your life. You answer my questions, all right? Who are you? - It doesn't matter, Talli. - How do you know my name? - Nothing really matters anymore. - You killed Sebastian. Are you one of my stepfather's affairs? - No. - Okay, what then? - You're fucking my husband. - Damian? I didn't know. - If you had known, would that have stopped you? Would that have changed anything? You're just like all the other girls, so impressed with his castle and his cars. His sophistication. He really had you fooled, didn't he? - I thought it was love. - Don't worry. Me too. Actually... I guess I have to thank you. It seems you freed me from him. - No hard feelings, then. - No hard feelings. - Okay. Then I guess I'll leave you to it. - You think you can just walk away from all this? - Why not? - Because you let him in, and now he'll always know where to find you. You don't know him like I do. He's a psychopath, Talli. And you're in his realm. You can't beat him here. - Help me. I can't do it alone. - I don't know. - It doesn't matter. It's a dream, isn't it? - It's much more than that. If he kills you in here, you die out there. - I thought nothing here counts. - Not for me anymore. But it still does for you. You're still alive. He can't control you yet. Shoot him. - Thank you, Josephine. Ah, sweetie, sweetie, sweetie. Don't fight it, sweetie. It's nearly done. Come on, don't fight it. It's nearly done, sweetie. - Leave her alone! - Hey... Oh my God. You're so beautiful. Now finally, it's your turn. What a hunt, huh? I like it. It's almost a shame it's over now. It'll be hard to find a worthy successor for you. You know what? Maybe I should let you get away, yeah? You know, let you live with the fear that I could always get to you any moment, unexpectedly. Just letting you know that I'm always having an eye on you. I would enjoy your fear. - Tick, tock. Tick, tock. Time's running. Tick, tock, tick, tock. Time's almost up. It won't be long now. Pure flame. Beautiful flame. Gentle little fire. Ouch! Mean flame. Mean little fire. Tick, tock. Tick, tock. Time's running. - Who are you? - Mmm... Time is almost up. It won't be long now. You made a nice little fire? - Where am I? And who are you? - I don't know. - You don't know where we are? - Where could we be? Looks like... Nowhere to me. - What's your name? - Um, I don't, I don't think that is important. If-if you're nowhere, you can't be there. And your name doesn't matter now, does it? - I'm Talli. Talita. I'm 19, and I'm somebody. - No. You're nobody too. You don't have anybody, like me. You're nobody. Otherwise, you wouldn't be here. - Of course I'm somebody. I have a mother and friends. You were born at some point, so you're somebody. Maybe I don't know where we are, but we'll get out. - No. This is, this is nonsense. Why am I talking to you anyway? You're nobody. Tick, tock, tick, tock. Time's running. Tick, tock, tick, tock. - Stop it! Can you feel that? I can touch you. That means I exist, and so do you. Tell me your name. - Once I... I had a name. I-I was somebody. - You can be somebody again. - I... I can be somebody again. - Is your name Talli? - Talli? What a, what a pretty name. Is-is that my name? - Yes, you're Talli. And you still are. You were born with that name, and you won't lose it. Say it. - Talli. My name is Talli. I-I-I have a name! - I have a name. That means I'm somebody. - That-that means I am somebody. I can't be nobody if, if I have a name. - I can't be nobody if I have a name. I have a name, and I have a voice, and I won't give up! - Looking for something? I got rid of all the weapons. You know it's pointless, don't you? This is my world, I decide what happens in here. You can't change a damn thing. Come on, come on, give it a try. Come on. - We'll see. - Boo. My world, my rules. Only thing is, you're not behaving as I wish you to. - Shh, Talli. Talli, Talli, shh, shh, shh. Why are you still fighting, huh? It makes no sense, seriously. Why do you insist on fighting? I don't get it. - You're asking me why I fight for my life? - Well, yes. Death is inevitable. The others got that, I mean, they just accepted it. Why don't... Ah, you know what? Maybe, maybe you're just stupid. Is it that? Is it possible you got a learning disability or something? - You prick. - Oh. Now have a look. - That's my-- - Hey, hey, hey. These are my thoughts. This here is my perfect world. And I decide what happens, and I decide who's allowed to be here. And well, yes, I can do with your son what I want to do. You got no power in here, little girl. This is my realm. - This is your realm? I'm in your head. Which means I can harm you. - Oh, can you now? Well, you know what? Be my guest, give it a shot. - If these are all your thoughts, why is your wife still alive, huh? I saw how you killed her. And Alex, why is he here? Why do you want me to see all of this? - Your thoughts, Talli, your thoughts are-are different than mine. This here, this is all my creation, you're in my house, my home. It's clean, bright and tidy. Everything's well-balanced. This is harmony. In your world, we met your evil stepfather, who you damned to live a life in prison, huh? We met your childish, shy, insecure little self who couldn't fight even if her life depended on it. We met your stupid best friend, whose pain you ignored, which drove her into suicide. And last but not least, we met your fool of an ex-boyfriend, whose heart you broke, and whose child you killed. Tears. Blood. Death. You destroy things. You bring chaos, hardship and pain upon those who love you and upon yourself. But now, I am offering you a home, yeah? I, I am offering you redemption from your sins. Why don't you just take it? Please say yes, Talli. Just take it. Please, please take it! What's going on? Has the cat got your tongue? Did you realize... - I was here... I was here a long time ago. - I visited all those places to remind myself of something. I made a vow once. - I was here before. No, that's not right. That's not, that's not his baby. - Wait a minute. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. These are my thoughts. This is, this is, this is my-my perfect world. I decide what's wrong and what's right. - I made a vow that I won't let anyone ever treat me like you did. I forgot that, but I now remember. You created this world because in real life, you're just a sad little man who hates himself. And now that I think about, Damian, I think it's fair enough to say that no one likes you. You're all alone. - You just shut up! - This is your world. Make me. She can't see you, can she? 'Cause if she could, she would rip you to shreds. Josephine? - You murdered me. You're a liar, a thief and a fraud. And I hate you. - No, no, no, this is not how it works. I'm not responsible for your fuck-up. It's your own goddamn fault, both of yours. - Oh, right. So I killed myself? You're pathetic. Isn't he? - I have no idea how I fell for him. Stay in your dream world, if you like. None of this is real if you're nothing but a fraud. - No! Oh my God, what's going on? This is impossible! What the hell? Oh baby, you really got me. You got some fighting spirit. Oh my God. God, you're beautiful. You're so, you're so beautiful... What's going on? I'm losing my thoughts. These are my goddamn thoughts. These are my, oh! - You hit me, I'm unconscious, and poof, here I am again. Cool, isn't it? I'm getting the hang of it. Don't worry, we're just getting started. - This is gonna be fun. - Oh, yes. - Run, you coward. We'll find you! This is your world now. And you can't hide from yourself. You need to be strong and fight. I'll help you. - No, these are my thoughts. These are my thoughts, this is my world. My thoughts in my head! This is-- Oh no, no! No, get out of my head! Goddamn bitches, get out of my, out of... My goddamn head! - Hello, darling. Comfy? - Where am I? - You're right where we want you to be. And there's nothing you can do about it. This might hurt a little bit. - Goodbye. Sebastian? Hey, it's me, Talli. I thought... Do you wanna meet up for coffee? It would be nice.
