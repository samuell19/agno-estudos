Okay, there are a few rules that you must obey while visiting the inmate.

Okay, enjoy your visit at Desert Canyon. - Wakey, wakey. - Wow, business is good, God bless America. Now, you see what happens when you apply yourself? What am I always saying, people? You have to be proactive, like this guy. Take a page out of his book, well done. - Prisoner 687303, rise and exit your cell. You have a visitor. - Well, we don't want to keep your visitor waiting. You never know when it's gonna be your last one ever. Let's go. - Come on. - It's a damn shame, kid, but that old man of yours is a monster, you know? He deserves everything that is coming to him. I'm just sorry his blood runs through you. - Where are we going? - So you do hablar the English. Good, you see, I thought my friend here was gonna have to translate for us, but this is better. You'll hear it straight from me. You're not going back to the cell block. In fact, you'll never have to see bars again. Vamonos. Did you know that back in the 1950's, before this was ever a prison, it was actually built as a fallout shelter? It's true, the government was so freaked out about the Red Scare that they built dozens of underground bunkers, including here at Desert Canyon. Eventually, the scare faded, of course, leaving all of these heavily fortified structures behind, so they figured they'd work as prisons. Over time, everyone forgot all about what lies beneath. - Where are you taking me? Someone will come looking. They'll know I'm missing. - You'd be amazed at what a few strokes of a keyboard can do. You see, in here, you're just numbers in a computer, and this morning, I deleted you. So, I can put you pretty much anywhere I want because you don't exist. Isn't that fun? I've done it before. - It was you. You ordered the hit. I was told by my employers that a jealous husband wanted his wife's ex-boyfriend to go away. Wanted it to be a big bang. And then your wife showed up. - And I was told that you were a professional. A flawless record, they said, that you make people disappear. Well, now I'm making you disappear, my way. - He was her lawyer, not her lover. She was gonna leave you. I watched them for weeks, never saw an affair. They only spoke by phone, and suddenly, she shows up the day I strike. It felt wrong. When she called to him, he was surprised to see her. He rushed to her, saw something on her face. A bruise, you hit her. You made sure she'd run to him. He was consoling her, not caressing her, and then he did what you knew he would. He put her in his car. You were scared she was gonna call the feds, tell about what happens in this place. She knew your secrets and so did the lawyer. - And so do you, which is why you're disappearing, just like they did. I think I've heard about enough out of you. Let me show you your new home. And I think you'll be glad to know that you'll be safe down here, as I have the only set of keys. Now, it's time to say goodbye. There it is, the deluxe suite. Yeah, I think you're gonna be very happy. What the fuck are you doing? - My job, cabron. - Okay, give me that thing. - Just breathe. Why? - He had a debt to pay. You paid the commission for one kill, not two. That debt must be paid. - Okay, I'll pay more. I have money. - We know. That wasn't your money to take. - You'll never make it out of here. You can't just walk out. - Actually, I can. I'm just a number that you deleted, remember? Besides, I was just visiting. - Keys, warden. - And um, one more thing. You can't be serious. Come on, we can, you can't be serious! I have money! Let me go! Come on, you can't just walk away! - Please let The Hawk know, I did what was asked of me. I hope this puts things right with the commission. - Your debt is paid. No more card games for you. - Yeah. - Get off my car. The glasses, nice touch. - Aw, thanks, yeah, they're my dad's. Hey man, that was fun, we should do it again. Can I be the inmate next time? Maybe you could be, like, my uncle or something. - Yeah, sure, kid. - So what's next, boss? - We go see The Hawk. Debts are owed, it's our job to collect.
