"Shaw Brothers Ltd." "A Shaw Studios Production" Young master... Young master... Your father's back. - Has the Japanese girl come with him? - Yes. What does she look like? Well, from a distance, her upper body is... And her lower body is... Never mind, she was ugly as a kid. Oh, really? Well, she'll be even uglier now she's grown up. Exactly! - You have to pretend to be ill, remember? - But how? Pretend to have a high fever like uncle did the other day. A high fever? But I don't have one. Lie down. - Come on... - What are you doing? Come on, come on. Ah tao, what are you two doing? Sir, the young master has a high fever yet he wants hot tea. Father. You seem to have a very high fever. Well, why hasn't a doctor been called? I wanted to get a doctor, but ah tao said there was no need. Ah tao, I rushed back to arrange your wedding. But you're clearly ill. You should see a doctor. I'd rather die than be forced into marriage. Nonsense, a man should get married when he comes of age. This marriage was arranged when you were a child. And lady yumiko grew up with you. How could it be "forced"? I'll never marry that Japanese girl with a runny nose. Girls can change a lot after they grow up. Yumiko is now a well-known beauty in Kyoto. Ah tao, her father has maintained a business relationship with us and he has supported our business. Besides, this marriage has already been arranged a long time ago. And she's arrived now. How can you refuse? This is a mercenary marriage and I won't accept it. I had brought you back to study but you seem to have become more muddled. No, I'm rather clearer on what's right and wrong. - This is a forced marriage. - You... Calm down. Ah tao, how could you...? Don't try to reason with him. Shou, quickly get a doctor. - Go, now! - Yes. I hope you'll be comfortable staying with us. Get some rest today. Young master! Young master! - What are you...? - Come here, look. Ah tao, what's happened to you? - Is that really her? - Yes. Ah man. Father, I've forgotten how to say, "long time no see" and "how are you" in Japanese. "Shibaraku, genki desu ka?" "Shibaraku, genki desu ka?" Hello. Long time no see. Yumiko, your Chinese is so good. Father, did you teach her? She's been learning from your father since she was a child. Brother tao, aren't you sick? You should rest. I'm not sick. - Come, have a drink. - Please come in. The bride is here! Why is the bride dressed like that? I know, right? How could she wear white? It's unlucky to wear white at your wedding! - Look, even her shoes are white. - How could she? Let's prepare for the marriage rituals. The bride and groom will now bow three times to the old master. - Why is she not kneeling? - I've never seen anything like this. - What's wrong with her? - Kneel. Exactly, she's marrying a Chinese! The bride and groom will now bow three times to the old master. First bow. Second bow. Third bow. Turn around and bow to thank your relatives and guests. First bow. Bow again. Third bow. The noises we hear, is that practicing or fighting? - I clearly hear fighting. - Who's fighting? Has the young master practiced his kung fu this morning? Kung fu practice? I don't think so. He's only been married for a few days, how could he get up this early? - You're right. - The young master is beating his wife. Don't talk nonsense! Did you see it with your own eyes? No, but we heard it with our own ears. They're newlyweds, so that seems unlikely. - Where did you hear it? - In the backyard. Backyard? Right, let's take a look. He really is beating his wife! I'll tell the old master. Let's go! Gordon liu Good morning, yumiko. Good morning. You're up early every day. Are you getting enough sleep? I'm used to getting up at six every morning to exercise. Yumiko. - It can't be. - I heard it with my own ears. - It's true. - Father! Why don't you stay for a few more days? The business in Japan needs taking care of. Where's yumiko? She's coming down. Japanese seikendo expert yuka mizuno father. Give my regards to my father when you return to Japan. - Tell him that I'm happy here. - I shall. And that my husband is good to me as well. Yumiko ... I never thought we could have as fine a daughter-in-law as you. - After I go, you... - Father, don't worry. Ah tao, the secret to married life is to love each other. If a husband mistreats his wife, that's the most despicable of things. --Yumiko. --Father. If ah tao mistreats you, don't hesitate to tell me. - Shou. - Yes? What did you say to my father? - I was scolded because of you. - No, it wasn't me, young master. - Tell me! - I really didn't. Tell me now! - Do I really have to? - Tell the truth! Young master, you... You beat young madam... - Good morning. - Hey, morning! Young master, doesn't this sound like you're beating your wife? Come on... bring it on. Young master, are you all right? - How dare you stare? Get lost! - Yes, sir. Yumiko, have you finished? I have. Go upstairs and rest. Sorry about earlier. I'd no idea you didn't know any kung fu. Did I hurt you? You could see that I'm no good at martial arts? - What were you practicing just now? - First, I was showing you some karate. Then I threw you with some judo. - Anything wrong? - How indecent. - Judo is Japan's national martial art. - Yes. I know what judo is. I meant your chest was exposed. Don't you find that embarrassing? This is my uniform for practicing. It facilitates kicks and punches. If a woman was seen by gamblers kicking like that, they'd lose for sure. Chinese women who practice kung fu, don't they punch and kick in the same way? It's slightly different. Chinese women practice kung fu with more elegance. Take the horse stance as an example. They do it like this. How can you move like this? That was an advance, this is a retreat. This is called the two goat clamping stance. How do you kick then? - Kick. - I kicked. - Kick again. - I kicked again. These are the under-skirt serial kicks used by Chinese women. They are well hidden when performed, and at the same time are proper and well-mannered. You were gentle and well-mannered like a lady. But we Japanese ladies are different. We use great strength when we fight. - Did I hurt you? - I'm fine. You can be rough during your daily practices. But don't yell at the top of your voice. Why not? If the servants hear it, they'll think I'm beating my wife. Ah man! This is the first time you've come to train since getting married. You must've forgotten most of your kung fu. No, I don't think so. He's been a daily punch bag for his wife. I bet he's had plenty of practice at rolling with the punches. - What did you say? - What did I say? I said, your Japanese wife's kung fu is really good. Someone saw she threw you down with little effort and you... - Stop. Calm down. - Who said that? - Don't talk nonsense. - It's not nonsense, shou said so. His wife threw a kick like that and he witnessed it. He's been losing every time. He hasn't won in a month. You... Young master, please have mercy. I spoke the truth. They exaggerated. It's not my fault. If you hadn't told them, how did they know? Young master, she's your wife. Only you could know these things. What do I know about your wife, right? - Don't run! - Young master, please have mercy! Young master, big problem. The backyard has been destroyed. - What? - The backyard. - What are you doing? - I am practicing kung fu. Stop it! Does practicing kung fu involve demolishing walls and smashing statues? There are no punch bags here... And no wooden boards. How am I supposed to practice? So I had to kick the wall. One, two, three, four, five, six! Young madam, if you keep practicing like this, in less than six months, you could demolish the whole house! Nonsense! - Shou, get these repaired now! - Yes, sir. Right away. Let's go. Yumiko, from now on, I forbid you to practice kung fu. Why is that? Yumiko, if you really love martial arts, then let me teach you Chinese kung fu. - Chinese kung fu? - Yes. Because Chinese ladies practice kung fu in a well-mannered way, it's not as rough. - I'm not a Chinese lady. - But your husband is a Chinese. - You should learn Chinese kung fu. - Your wife is Japanese. Why don't you learn Japanese martial arts? You're kicking down walls every day. If you go on like this, we won't have a place to sleep in. Yumiko, can you do less punching and kicking, and practice something else? Don't worry. - My training gear will be here soon. - What kind of equipment? There's a delivery from Japan! - It's not a dowry, but weapons. - Weapons! There are swords too! Yumiko, these weapons... Ah, these are the weapons I've asked to be sent from Japan. A Japanese sword... Kendo. Heavens! What's all the fuss about? Young master, look, it's been... - Impressive. - There's more. These are called "sai". There's still more. - Yumiko, you... - This is a spear. Fine, you want to flee? This is a chained hook, designed to catch those who want to run away. - Yumiko, stop it. - There are many more. Ah tao, you love practicing kung fu, so why stop yumiko from doing it? - You don't know, she... - She always tries to compete with you? No, she practices Japanese martial arts and nothing else. There's no place at home for her to practice. There is. Isn't there a kung fu training hall at your home? Yumiko has a strong personality. She might not like our Chinese style training hall. Young master, big problem! Young madam is moving her Japanese weapons into your training hall. Good, let her practice there, then. No, she's moved all your Chinese weapons out of the hall. - Quickly, move them out. - Yes. What are you doing? It's not our fault. Orders from the young madam. - Move them all back. - Yes. Quickly, move these out. Come on, move those out as well. Quick! Stop. Ah man... Yumiko, what's the meaning of this? Oh, I've just found out there's a great training hall here. If you'd told me sooner, I wouldn't have practiced in the backyard and demolished the wall. Why do you have to move these weapons out? A good training hall needs real weapons. Yumiko, these are weapons also. I know nothing about how to use these, so they are basicallyjunk to me. Junk? This is a sword, the king of weapons. Its history goes back several thousand years in China. It has been passed down, and there are many different styles of swordsmanship. This is the eight trigrams sword style. You look like a dancing girl when you do that. Strong, powerful, fierce and aggressive, this is real sword practice! All that noise and messy movement, it's like a beggar chasing dogs away. Nonsense! In Japan, those who practice kendo have a spiritual connection when they hold their sword. How could you insult it? You have a spiritual bond with this worthless metal? - Why not marry it instead? - You... Young master! Young madam! Stop fighting! Stop fighting, please! This sword doesn't seem like junk to me. Do you understand now? Young madam, your sword. What you're holding is not a spear. - This is a real spear. - Bring it on! Young master! Young madam! Please stop fighting. Go and get uncle to help. That's your spear technique? So many gaps, you're too exposed. Brute strength does not help. Let me show you a few real spear techniques. This red plume is known as the blood shield. It can obscure the enemy's field of vision... And also tie up the opponent's weapons. Uncle, quickly, through here! Yumiko, ah man! Ah tao, stop fighting! Stop! - Uncle. - Uncle. Look at the mess you've made here! Yumiko likes martial arts, and I'm teaching her kung fu. I don't have time for your nonsense Chinese martial arts! - You call our kung fu nonsense? - Only Japanese martial arts are useful. - Japanese martial arts are useless! - No, Chinese kung fu is useless! You've just lost to me. So, which is more useful? Ah tao, yumiko, each of your styles have their own virtues. Yumiko! Young madam. Ah man... Young master, where should we put all these weapons? Wherever! Young master! Chinese on one side, and Japanese on the other, then. Yumiko, come and sit here and eat. You should kneel here and eat. How could a martial artist kneel? Japanese martial artists knee! Out of respect. In history, only criminals about to be beheaded would knee! And eat like that. Now you're kneeling to eat like those criminals! - What did you mean by throwing eggs? - It's a secret weapon. A secret weapon? Then look at mine! Now, are you going to sit down like me and eat? The table is too big to be regarded as a secret weapon. Yumiko, your meal is here. Come and eat with me. Forget about it. Let's eat. Shou, bring the young madam's food over there. - Yes, sir... - I don't want it. I won't eat any food you've touched. Alright, forget it. There are many kinds of secret weapons in China. This is called a coin dart. This is the Japanese iron sea star. - These are flying needles. - These are flying rings. - These are flying daggers. - Japanese flying daggers. - These are flying darts. - Cross darts. Mini flying guillotine. Iron caltrops. What is it? You can't see it. - This is called a sleeve arrow. - Sleeve arrow? This is a real secret weapon. Not bad. - Does a hairpin count as a secret weapon? - Yes, and I'm impressed. Out of the way! Don't be scared. It's alright now. Your movements were too obvious when using your secret weapons. That gives your opponents a chance to avoid them. This is the famous Chinese back arrow. It can catch your opponents off guard. - Yumiko, what are you doing? - Leave me alone. - I said, leave me alone. - You... - Morning, young madam... - Why are you angry? It's so unreasonable to be losing your temper so early in the morning. Young madam. Young master... Shou, those Japanese weapons, the dagger, the spear, the sword, the stick and the secret weapons, they were all historically from China. Isn't that right? - Er, yes, yes... - Say it! They're all from China. - No! Shou... - Yes? Over a thousand years ago, such weapons already existed in Japan. They just look similar to Chinese weapons. Isn't that right, shou? - Yes, that's correct... - Wrong! Also, Japanese writing characters evolved from Chinese characters. - Yes... - This is about martial arts, not culture. - It's about martial arts now. - Same thing! - Same thing! - No way! Let's fight and see! - All right, then. - What are we competing over? - Young madam... - Anything! Young master, young madam, please don't fight anymore. Young master, young madam, I... Shou! Sorry, shou. This is all your fault. - No, this is on you! - You started it! - You suggested we should compete. - I didn't say to fight in here! - Where, then? - In the training hall. This is a Chinese kung fu technique known as the block hand. This is the Chinese leg strike. This is the scissor leg strike. This is the Buddha's closed palm technique. Judo! - Please post this. - Uncle! Uncle! The young master and young madam are fighting again. Come down. Watch me. Let's try once more. Stop fighting! Ah tao, stop fighting! This is known as "cripple li carrying water". Still want to fight? Your stick is shorter than mine, so you're going to lose. - Yumiko... - Young madam... - Ah tao? - Shou! Young master, am I doing it right? - Ah man ... - Really? Shou? Yumiko, why are you hiding? Are you admitting defeat and dare not come out? I'm waiting for you. Ah man! Are you admitting defeat now? Defeat? Look at your outfit, what is it? How little you know about martial arts! This is ninjutsu. Its powers are boundless once profoundly mastered. You were at my mercyjust now. Had I used stronger gun powder, you'd have been blown to pieces. If poison had been applied to the dagger, you would have died. Are there such martial arts in China? Of course, but it's not called ninjutsu. It is better known as an ambush art. Poisons, lethal aromas, secret arrows, such things are forbidden in the world of Chinese kung fu. Only treacherous villains use them! What other insults do you have? Come on, spit them out. I'm not insulting you, it's the truth. The way of kung fu is to be fair and open. To win amongst chaos is the most important thing. Winning is indeed important, but so is the method one employs. What you did was despicable. - What did you call me? - I'm not talking about you. I'm referring to the ninja skills. They are not worth learning. You're just talking nonsense, you don't know the history of ninjutsu. I wouldn't want to hear about anything that shameful even if you were to tell me. People who are ignorant of Japanese martial arts aren't worthy opponents! Stop. The star kick! Lion rolling ball. Back kick. Ah tao, who have you been fighting? No one... But... Ah tao, how many times have I told you? Learning under my tutelage, you should understand that knowing some kung fu doesn't mean you can fight any time you want. Mastering kung fu means you should be humble in every way. - That's the true way of martial arts. - Understood. - Who did you fight with? - It's someone who... Someone who said Japanese martial arts were better than Chinese kung fu. I couldn't accept that. So I fought with this person in every category, and I won every time. This is because you haven't met a truly skilled Japanese master. Who is this Japanese martial arts master? Could you bring him to our school to show us a few techniques? Teacher, this... Yes, that would broaden our teachings. Right, quiet! That's not really possible. It'd be difficult to invite her. I've confiscated this Japanese master's equipment. How could she face us? Young master. Young master. Shou, when did she leave? Early morning, right after you left, she packed up and left. Why didn't you stop her? - Young master, she... - You should've told me sooner. Young master, it's because I wanted to inform you that I got a solid Japanese kick from the young madam. However, if! Hadn't told you, you would've slapped me. - Where are my uncle and aunt? - They... - Uncle, aunt... - Her boat has already departed. Welcome. This way please. Master, your guests have arrived. Please. Tailong. Please. Has yumiko written back to you? For young couples, arguing and fighting is unavoidable. There's an old Chinese saying, "it's better for a father-in-law to pretend to be blind and deaf." Fortunately, yumiko is a smart girl or I'd probably never see her again. - What are you saying? - Yumiko is... It's all ah tao's fault. I'll teach him a lesson when I return. It's too late. Yumiko now refuses to go back. What? Yumiko has returned to Japan? Yes, follow me. You were such a long time in Hong Kong, and never wrote. Yes, I've been quite busy. That's why. - Who is this man? - He... Yumiko, an unhappy marriage can cause a lot of pain. Yumiko. Father. Ninjutsu expert yasuaki ku rata yumiko, all problems can be resolved. Why have you come back to Japan? And does ah tao know? He has no idea. I've been back for some days. This ah tao! He should have come to Japan with you. Are you two...? Yumiko is my daughter-in-law, let go of her! Please let go. Meet the famous martial artist, takeno the ninjutsu expert. Yumiko, train hard if you don't want to be taken advantage of. Yumiko, come back with me immediately. I'll get ah tao to apologize to you. I won't return until I have completed my training. Let's go. Good bye. Yumiko, yumiko, yumiko! Brother I ... They've practiced martial arts together since they were children, they've always been really close. You'd better go back home. And ask ah tao to bring her back, othennise... All right, I understand. I'll return immediately. - Young master... - Leave me alone. The moonlight leads the way home Father, you're back. Ah tao, yumiko has returned to Japan. Why didn't you go after her right away? Yumiko, what is she to me? She's your wife, for goodness sake! Wife? I order you to go to Japan and apologize to her immediately. - Father! - I tell you now... If you don't go, she won't be your wife for much longer. In Japan, there's a martial artist called takeno who's really close with yumiko. I don't care. You, stop right there! - Did you hear what I said? - Brother, let it go. You've just arrived. Leave this until tomorrow. Yes, take it easy. Ah tao, you've gone too far. Young master! What is it? Young master, I... Oh, I think my back is broken! Young master, I have this genius idea. It's better than praying to Buddha. No more of your nonsense! Oh, my butt! This time it's for real. I'm not lying. It can help bring the young madam back without having to go to Japan. - You really know such a way? - Of course. Young master, sit down first. Please sit. Here, take this. Come on. - What do you think? - Good. - Correct? - Yes. You're improving fast. Yumiko ... I regret burying myself deep into martial arts training in the past. Othennise, you might've become my wife instead. Young madam... A letter for you. A challenge letter. "Yumiko, I hear Japan has martial arts too. "Martial arts have a long history and originated from China. "Chinese kung fu is famous around the world, "while Japanese martial arts are rather insignificant. "It has been proven throughout history that Chinese kung fu is superior. "Back in Japan, you must have improved your skills. "If you are ready for a contest with me, regardless of what style you use, "as long as you win in one style, I'll concede defeat." It's signed: "Ah tao". Well, what do you think? Teacher, what should we do? Japanese martial arts master naozo kato how skillful is your husband in martial arts? Well, he... Be silent! I would like to see for myself. Teacher... I'll go too. Black belt karate expert hitoshi omae I'll go too. Kendo expert riki harada I'll go too. Spear expert nobuo yana let me go, too. Karate expert yujiro sumi I'll go, too, teacher. Nunchaku expert - hayato ryuzaki I'll go, too, teacher. Sai expert - yasutaka nakazaki I'll go, too, teacher. Very well. Goodbye. The residence I'd say, wait and see. The young madam will definitely return today. In fact, she might be... There they are. She has so many relatives. Where's the young madam? Where's ah man? Oh, you must be her older brother. And you're her grandfather. You're her uncle and you're her cousin. And younger brother... - And that's the challenge letter. - Yes, we're here to accept the challenge. Right now? So you're not...? - Ask Mr. Ho to come out. - Young master! - Young master, at... at the gate... - What is it? - And you are? - May I ask, are you Mr. Ho? Yes. My name is takeno. - Your reputation precedes you. - Thank you. Meet Japan's famous grandmaster kato. My specialty in Japanese martial arts is ninjutsu. These are masters of various Japanese martial disciplines. We came all the way from Japan to accept your challenge. My challenge? I have no issues with Japanese martial arts. - This must be a misunderstanding. - Was this letter not written by you? To yumiko ... Yes. That was written to my wife, yumiko. How did you get it? Yumiko is Japanese. Your challenge to her is the same as challenging us all. This is between us as husband and wife. Yumiko is no longer your wife. What did you say? Young master... He's a Japanese sword master. And you are holding a Chinese sword. - Shall we see which is superior? - I have no such intention. You're pretty good. Why don't you accept my sword? You Chinese have no manners! You Japanese have no manners. Shame on you trying to outnumber us. - Let's see what you can do! - Don't worry... We Japanese wouldn't commit such dishonorable acts. This is the next competitor from our side. He is a Japanese karate master. It'll be one on one. I'll arrange a time with you. Ah tao, you are in great trouble this time. I never thought it would come to this. Teacher, since the Japanese are here, we mustn't let them think we're weak. We can call all the kung fu masters and hold a martial arts contest. Let's do it! Wang chun qiang. It's all right if we fight to share our martial arts experience. But if we beat this group, another group will follow. If this goes on, the outcome will eventually be damaging. Think about it. Is this our purpose in learning kung fu? Teacher, what shall we do, then? We can't let ah tao fight them alone. He's surely no match for them. Wang chun qiang, our teacher is right. We shouldn't let things getoutofhand. They are here for a challenge, so I'll challenge them one by one. So even if! Lose, it'll only concern me. It will have nothing to do with the Chinese martial arts community. It's good that you understand the point. Your fundamental kung fu is not bad. It's unlikely you'll lose every bout. You won your sword fight today. Tomorrow's karate fight is all about kicks and punches. The Japanese have great power in their palm strikes. It'll be difficult to handle. You are no match for him. Ah tao, don't feel so disheartened. There are many forms of Chinese fist strikes. Japanese fist Styles are limited in comparison. Teacher, which fist style should I use? Fight him with Shaolin arhat fist style. Meet force with force. No, you can use any style. But I think that if you want to win, using softness to conquer strength is the key. Japanese fist styles are powerful and explosive. You must fight with agility and many variations while attacking with strong force. Teacher, what style would that be? Drunken boxing style. Drunken master su - lau kar-leung I'll go and talk to him. Ah tao, that won't work. We all know that master su doesn't normally teach others. Then what should I do? You two, come here. If teacher finds out about this, we're in deep trouble. It's for you to learn drunken boxing style. Teacher wouldn't blame us. Go on. Do it again. If you want to sit, boys, then I'll let you. - Go on, quick. - Alright, alright. He's not moving now. - Try again! - We've already suffered many blows. It's your turn. Ah tao, have you learnt it? Yes, but it's still a bit unclear. Still a bit unclear? Try again. Start with dreamy, misty eyes. Hide your strength in soft motion. Turn your body from the waist. Combine with light, drunken footsteps. Ah man... Do you understand what he just performed? Almost. There are too many people here. Let's practice in the school. Let's go. All right, let's all go home and practice. Alright. Bye. See you. Ah man... Yumiko, you're back. How could you write that challenge letter? It was from me to you. - Who asked you to disclose it to others? - I... Did you think I'd be scared by the large group of people you've brought? I didn't bring those men. If I lose, it'd just mean shame for me. No big deal! When the kendo master presented you with the sword, why did you ignore him? When did he present me with the sword? He wanted to give you his sword as a sign that he had yielded. This is the highest form of respect and a sign of admiration according to the way of the samurai. That's what he was doing. You ought to have received it with both hands. And from that moment, not only are you no longer enemies, you also become friends. And now? As you have declined his respect, he will take this as the greatest insult for a samurai and might kill himself by hara-kiri. So now this won't be an ordinary competition anymore. They must try every effort to beat you. Young master! Young master! The Japanese have delivered a challenge letter. "We await you at the five goats Ridge at noon tomorrow." Signed: "Takeno." Takeno, this whole thing was started by me owing to a slight misunderstanding on my part which brought all of you to China. Please plead with them on my behalf. Yumiko ... I cannot accept that your husband has disrespected his Japanese wife. I am here to fight for your honor. - But I don't want you to. - Yumiko. Ah man! Why did you plead with them? You have brought shame on your husband. We Chinese will not be cowards! Grandmaster. Please instruct me. How could you get drunk before a fight? How could you drink beforehand? Tell him, this is China's famous drunken boxing style. He says it's Chinese drunken boxing. - Stop. You've lost. - Teacher, let me try again. I've lost. You can do what you like with me. Wasn't it agreed that I'd fight one master a day? Yes. He'll wait for you outside your place tomorrow. Young madam. Continue! The opponent will have nunchaku in his right hand and a short stick in his left hand, so it's similar to... Sword and tonfa in Chinese kung fu, right? Yes, they're similar. But the weapons are slightly different. His weapon is quite rare even in Japan. Then his style must have many variations. What weapon will you use against him? Nunchaku... Tonfa... - Shou, come here! - Then he'd lose... - Yes, young master. - Get me a three-section staff. That's right. He uses a stick and nunchaku which would equal a three-section staff. Then it would be fair. There are many variations with the three-section staff. Your three-section staff is longer than my nunchaku. I have lost. Young madam, he must've said that his weapon is shorter and that's why he's lost. Yes. Shou, don't celebrate too soon. There are more challenges tomorrow. Master, I've lost. Tomorrow. Follow me! I shall stop fighting. Young master! Are you ready? He asked if you're ready. - Wasn't I going to fight one a day? - Wasn't this the arrangement? Exactly! What's he doing? - What are you doing? - I'm waiting. He's waiting. Waiting? Will you be waiting till dawn? You're... - You're really going to wait here? - All right, then, suit yourself. Wait! It's now tomorrow. He said it's a new day now. A new day? - It isn't dawn yet. - He says dawn hasn't arrived yet. Look! It's past twelve. That means a new day. He said it's past twelve so it's a new day now. You're too sly. You won't even let me rest. You won't let him rest. - You don't dare fight, huh? - What do you mean? I'll fight you. Young master. - You admit defeat? - He's asked whether you admit defeat. Young master. You're cunning, smearing oil on your body. He said you're cunning using oil on your body. You came to fight at this late hour. You're the cunning one, fatty. You've come to fight this late, you're cunning. Still want to fight? If not, you lose. He says if you don't fight, you lose. Lose? Let's fight! Come on! He's fallen! You're done fighting? I've lost. - But... - He said he's lost. He's nicknamed never topple and he admits defeat when he's fallen. He should've fallen long ago. What a strange person yet with excellent martial art skills. He is not that great. Wait till you meet takeno, he's the best. He could use ninjutsu to attack at any time and take you by surprise. Young master, I have a better idea. Yumiko? I'll wait for you at clear water pond. You'll be a disgrace to China if you don't come. Excuse me, could you tell me the way to clear water pond please? Clear water pond. You hear? Clear water pond! Clear water pond! Oh, clear water pond! It's over in that direction. Thanks. Let me take you there. Just wait! - Come along. - Thank you. These illusionary tricks are the tactics of ninjutsu. - Impressive. - Now taste the power of my ninja sword. First round, you win. I'll wait for you at clear water pond. Well? You admit losing to ninjutsu? What else have you got? Watch the Japanese crab fist, you might not have seen it before. Impressive. This is the Chinese crane fist. Master... I've finally won. Don't kill him, just teach him a lesson. I want to chop off his hands! Mr. Ho ... Your breath-holding technique is of the highest order... Even amongst ninjutsu techniques. I admire that. I don't think that is of the highest order. The highest order is the cultivation of the martial arts spirit. Don't you agree? Takeno, please interpret for me. I wish to explain to all masters that the challenge letter wasn't written to challenge the Japanese martial world but to bring my wife back swiftly. I didn't expect it to cause such a misunderstanding. Also, being unfamiliar with samurai etiquette, I didn't accept the sword presented by the kendo master, thus unintentionally insulting the way of the samurai. Also, I've had a chance to witness the various types of Japanese martial arts which command my highest respect. Please accept my sword.
