[waves crashing] [projector whirring] [intriguing music] [projector whirring] [door opens] [projector clicks] Came into my room without knocking. Albert. You know, you're not supposed to watch this kind of film. I pay for it. This is my projector, and this is my room. I know, but you know what the doctor says about your watching this kind of stuff. It's not good for you. [door closes] I like it. I like to look at it. What does he know about what I like? [nurse chuckles] Come on now, Albert. It's a nice-- - [nurse yelling] - [dramatic music] Don't watch this! [nurse screaming] [overlapping yelling] [groaning] [indistinct] Stop. [nurse gasping] No, stop it. Stop it, Albert! [groaning] No, no! No! [sobbing] No! Stop it! Stop! [grunting] [gasping] [choking] Are you all right? He almost killed her. You don't want to be cured, you miserable bastard. You guys came into my room without knocking, didn't you? Oh! [dramatic music] [gentle music] Mommy, when is Albert coming home? Now, don't ask a lot of nosy questions that doesn't concern a little girl. Mommy! Now stop moving around so much. I'll never get this zippered up. There. Off to school. - Alice. - Oh, yes, ma'am. I've asked you several times to get out the goblets for tonight's dinner, Alice. I was just going to do it, Mrs. Robertson. Annie, show Mrs. Robertson how pretty you look. You look very lovely, my dear. Thanks, Mrs. Robertson, for the lovely dress you bought. Thank you, Mrs. Robertson. - Goodbye, mama. - Uh, huh, huh. Run into your room and get your sweater. And don't forget your books! Now, will you get the goblets? Albert. [Dr. Burton] You hurt that nurse? [Albert] My mother has taken everything from me. [Dr. Burton] No one has taken anything from you. My mother is a whore. In the Middle Ages, she would have been stoned to death. [Dr. Burton] Your mother is not a whore. And this is not the Middle Ages. Albert, what do you want? I want my films. [Dr. Burton] They agitate you, Albert? You're here because we've got to deal with your feelings that all women are whores. You tried to knife your mother. She's unclean. She's depraved. But it doesn't do any good to explain to you, does it? Huh? [Dr. Burton] Your mother wants to see you. - [Dr. Burton] Will you talk with her? - Oh, not here. At home. You let me go home. - [Dr. Burton] I can't. - You can! You're in complete charge of me. I've seen the papers. [Dr. Burton] Then you should know that I can't let a man in your condition go anyplace. Dr... You are a stupid, deformed, subhuman creature that does not deserve to be alive. And I have had enough of this conversation. All right, Albert. I'll see you tomorrow. There ought to be wars to kill off all the misfits and culls. Like this one. Now, what good is breeding if all it ever results in is a multiplication of worms? [phone rattling] [phone rings] [sighs] Robertson's residence. Mrs. Robinson, please. She's out in the garden right now. Would you like to leave a message? No, I'd like to talk to her. This is Dr. Burton. Oh, yes, Dr. Burton. I'll go get her. I'll hold it. Tell her I'm coming out to see her. It's about her son. Thank you. [phone clatters] They do look like a bunch of nuts, aren't they? Of course you don't really belong here, do you? Well, I thought it would be a relief for you to talk to someone it's not caged up. Nutty. You always say you're not off your rocker. I don't want to hear anything you have to say. Listen, there's no rule against attendance talking to the idiots. It comes with the job. I know exactly what you're doing. You want to annoy me until I attack you, and then you're going to use it as an excuse to report me to the doctor again. [attendant laughing] Hey, you know, you're right. Maybe you're not completely bug-house at all. You really roughed up that nurse. You know what that means? Out. The State Mental Hospital. The doctor can't keep you here. That's the law. You're a violent and dangerous nut, and we can't handle you. Now, why don't you get violent with me? How come you only have your tantrums with the patients that can't fight back? And the nurses? You're a spoiled, rotten $30 million brat. I put you down in the coal mines with a pick handle and see if that would cure you. Have you ever seen the State Hospital? Yeah. They wrap you up in a straitjacket with the electric wires, and a rubber hose in the face if you try anything. Think about it, sweetheart. [Albert] Wait. What do you want? [Albert] I've always wanted to see one of my films. I'll show you one. What are you talking about? We took all your films away. [Albert] I've got some left. - [Albert] I hid them. - [attendant] Yeah? Where are they? [Albert] I'll show them to you but... you've got to promise me something first. What? [Albert] I want you to help me escape before they send me to the State Hospital. Sure, pal. Sure. You can count on me. Alright, get the shades. Pull up the screen. [clattering] [rattling] [projector whirring] Mrs. Robertson. Dr. Burton, how nice to see you. Although, if you've come all the way out here from the hospital, there must be something wrong. Yes, I'm afraid there is. What has my poor baby done now? Mrs. Robertson. Albert attacked a nurse this morning. Oh. How dreadful. She must have provoked it. I don't think so. Laura, I can't help Albert. [Laura chuckles] Why? [sighs] Well, for one, I simply can't reach him. I've tried. Albert needs... The type of help we're not set up to give him. He needs maximum security. Oh. Dr. Burton, you're not suggesting I send my son to an institution for insane people? There's no shame in having a son like this. Albert is not insane. He's emotionally disturbed and he needs help. [dramatic music] [projector whirring] All right. I do appreciate all you've done for... [phone ringing] No need for that. Thank you for coming, Dr. Burton. Please understand we're only set up to handle mildly disturbed cases. But I strongly urge you-- Why doesn't Alice answer that phone? Yes. Yes, he's still here. Just one moment, please. It's for you. Yes? Oh my God. Is anything the matter? [alarm blaring] Officer, that boy cannot be held responsible for what he does. Do you think this guy is crazy and not responsible for his actions, right? That has to be wrong. Wrong. [phone ringing] Wait, if that's him try to keep him on as long as possible and try to find out where he is. I'll use the phone in the kitchen and try to trace the call. Hello. Hello, Mother. Albert, darling. Where are you? I can hardly wait to see you. [car horn honks] Hello? Hello? Hello? [sobbing] Look... Hey dad, I'd get her out of here If I were you. [upbeat music] [curtains rattling] [upbeat music continues] [suspenseful music] [tense music] [tense music] [dramatic music] [door closes] You must be Albert. I recognize you from your pictures. Who are you? Alice. Alice Loman. I work for your mother. [indistinct] I take care of the house. Well, I better be going. I have an appointment. Where's my mother? She... She left. Where did she go? She-- she didn't say. Well, I better be on my way, I, I... I got to go. What's she afraid that I was going to kill her? No. No, of course not. She just had some plans and... And off she went. [chuckles] Hey, why don't I go downstairs and fix you some lunch? I could cook anything. Uh, what would you like? Thai. [laughs] Chicken? Mr. Robertson, yeah, I can cook that. Tell me something. Are you a virgin? I-- I don't-- I don't know if that it's any of your business. I mean... [chuckles] Just answer my question. I don't know what you're asking, Mr. Robertson, but let me tell you something. Whatever you're asking, I don't scare. I'm not trying to scare you. I asked you a question. Are you a virgin? I have a daughter. She's 11. I'm a widow. I'm a respectable woman. Poor Alice. Poor, poor Alice. [groans] What are you going to do? [chuckles] You tell me where Laura went and I'll let you go. What do you want her for? I'm going to kill her for locking me up and taking everything away. She didn't do that. The courts did it. She told them. How could she help it? You attacked her. Shut up! [chuckles] Are you afraid? I might be. All right? [screaming] [indistinct] I'm not going to kill you. You do what I say and I won't kill you. What do you want? Take your clothes off. Why? I said take your clothes off. Everything. But, but... Everything! All right, come on! Come on! Come on! Take the ribbon out of your hair. Okay, lift your breasts up. I don't understand. Come on, come on. Use your hands. Push them up. Now dance. I don't know how. [stuttering] Just... dance. Come on! I don't know how! [Albert screaming] I said dance! [gasping] [chuckles] Now sing. Sing! [singing] Le-- Let me call you, sweetheart. I'm in love with you. Let me call you, sweetheart. I'm in love with... Come on, come on, sing! [indistinct] [singing] In your eyes... [indistinct] [phone ringing] She doesn't answer. She must have left. [doorbell rings] [doorbell rings] [gasping] [suspenseful music] [soft music] [suspenseful music] [soft music] Hello. Hello. Why was the door locked? It was just like that when I came in. Where's my mother? Your mother? My mother and I live here. You don't know who I am, but I know who you are. You do? You're Albert. I recognize you from the picture. See? That's you. You're very pretty. Who are you? I'm Annie. Where's my mother? Your mother... Well, your mother got sick and she had to go to the doctors. And she wants you to wait right here for her. Mama went to the doctor? Yeah, but it's nothing very bad. And she wants you to wait right here. That's awful. How did she get sick? Well, she just started feeling bad, and she went to the doctors. While you're waiting, would you wanna see something funny? I think I better go to the doctor to see my mother. She's not going to be very long. And she said for me to be sure and tell you to wait right here for her. [insects chirping] Has anything happened? No, no, no. You know, I just thought I'd get my men out here first, you know? - Well... - What about the house? Oh, it'll be covered. It'll be covered. I want you to know the whole thing is my fault, actually, my fault. He should have been in an institution with maximum security. Yeah, I knew it, but I send him there. Uh-huh. Well, he's out now, isn't he? [chuckles] And when we catch him, it's... It's going to cost the taxpayers to feed him for the rest of his life. Nobody who's sick is without hope. He is a human life. Sure. Sure, they all are. You know what I'd do? Give them all a nice, quiet pill and that's it. We don't kill the insane. I know, I know, I know, I know. But you know what I'd like you to do? I'd like you to take a look at one of them after one of these idiots whacks him up with an ax. Listen, I'm sorry. With all due respect, ma'am. Oh. Don't worry, Laura. I'll stay here with you. Hey, look, look, I got my men outside. I don't like seeing nobody chopped up, you know? Nobody. So you're going to be all right. What will happen to Albert? Well, we are going to catch him, you know. He'll be hiding in a closet somewhere, and I'll feed him for the rest of his life. Penned up. Look, if I hear anything, I'll let you know, all right? - [sobbing] - [door closes] [gentle music] [orchestral music playing ] [soft piano playing] [sighs] You know, Albert and I really love each other. Why would he want to hurt me? Who could have loved him more? His father traveled so much. He was so much older than I. When he was home, he was too tired or too busy to pay much attention to Albert. But I was always there. [sobbing] He used to come into my bed and I held him and cuddled him. I took him everywhere with me. When he was only ten years old he'd pick out the dress he wanted me to buy. I don't know. [melancholic music] - [upbeat music] - [both laughing] What do you like the best? The circus or the movies or carnival or a magic mountain? Hmm. Magic mountain. Let's go there. I can't. I didn't ask my mother. Well, she said for me to take care of you and for me to make you happy in there. She'll be right there. That's what she said. I bet she wouldn't let me eat candy. Why? It's bad for your teeth. Oh, but this is good to you. It's good to you, is made out of peanut butter and honey and milk and it helps your teeth. [chuckles] You're not fooling me. Cross my heart and hope to die. Stick a needle in my eye. Let's see your teeth. [chuckles] See? No cavities. You have fillings. [sighs] You know what we're going to need if we go to Magic Mountain? A coat? Uh-huh. We're going to need some money. I'll tell you what. You wait right here. I'll go get some. You can eat a bowl of candy, all right. - I'll be right back. - Okay. [soft music] Hey, Mom. Mom. Mom. [dramatic music] [orchestral music] [intriguing music] [orchestral music] [intriguing music] [suspenseful music] Albert? Albert. I've got the money. We can go. Oh, boy! Are we friends? - Sure. - Really? Really. Okay, come on. Let's go. Come on! [gentle music] Careful. [Albert howling] [dramatic music] [upbeat music] Yeah. Hey, listen, why don't you have some of the guys check, uh, check the porno hubs and some of them sex bookstores? You know, because he's some kind of sex freak, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Listen... Listen, uh, listen... What's happening at the houses, huh? Both of them. Nothing? Okay, okay, I'll check you later, all right? All right, bye. [car horn honking] [gentle music] The Magic Mountain is closed until the wintertime, but I got a better idea.

No. She had a kid, for Christ's sakes. Didn't you guys-- Look around, for Christ's sakes! Come on, you guys. Come on, will you? For Christ's sakes! Jesus Christ! [phone rings] Hello. I don't know.

Look. They'll find him. Sit down, Laura. What is it? What's wrong? [pills rattling] Take these. Come on, drink up. Will my mother be back from the doctor's now? Your mother? Yeah. She was sick and went to the doctor's. You said she'd be right back. No, she's not going to be back yet. She's, uh-- She'll be a little bit longer. And when will she be back? I'm supposed to go home right after school and now I'll get in trouble. Annie, don't think about that. Did you ever take a great holiday and go stay in a hotel and eat breakfast in a restaurant? No. That's what your mother wants you to do. Tomorrow she's going to be at Laura's other house. But now she wants you to go to a hotel and she wants you to stay there. And you can have anything you want for breakfast. And no matter what you want, she told me to be sure that you get it. So how about another stuffed animal? Do you want a big one? Or maybe a tiny little one? They have them just like that. Oh, I have plenty of them. Come on, Annie. Let me buy you one. I want you to like me. I want you to be my friend. I want you to love me. I love you. My mother says to love everybody because that's what God does. - God does that? - Yes. Did you ever think that maybe God might be in the jaws of a shark? Or in the leaves? Or in all the cars that bump fenders? No. God's in the Bible. But couldn't it be in a merry-go-round? No, he's in the church. Didn't you ever go to church? You know something? You are clean and pure. And undefiled. [gentle music] You're the sweetest of all the visions of meaning there are. That's you. [Annie chuckles] [car horn honking] [Annie] Is this where we're going in? [Albert] Yes. The king of England once stayed here, and then the king of Belgium used this as his bridal suite. [Annie] What's a bridal suite? [Albert] It means the king stays here with his bride, and she's all in pure white. [Annie] This hotel looks very old. [Albert] It is. It was built in Victorian times. You're too young to know about the Victorian age, but it was, um... It was a beautiful time when men were gentlemen and ladies were all pure and those that weren't were killed or driven away. - [Annie] Am I pure? - [Albert] Yes. Yes, you are. Come on. They've reserved the bridal suite for us. [gentle music] Better sleep in. - It's another bedroom. - I know. [eerie music] We're going to play a game now. A beautiful game. What is it? You put your nightgown on. And then you find out. [traffic noise] [eerie music] [wedding music] [traffic noise] [suspenseful music] [phone rings] - Hello. - Doctor. I'd like to speak to my mother, please. Albert, where are you? May I speak to my mother, please? Where are you, Albert, please? Doctor, I'm very peaceful at the moment. I want you to do what I'm asking. All right, Albert. She's here. Talk to him. Don't say anything to upset him. Hello, Albert. Hello, Mother. Mother, I'm, I'm sorry about everything. I want you to do something for me. All right, Albert. I will. I need some money, and I want you to have some ready for me. All right, Albert. I'm going to be going away with someone. I'm going to be taking a bus trip or something. I don't know. But I'll need some money now, and I'll need some for later. And you can send me some then, okay? Tell him you'll come there and talk to him. Do you want me to bring it there to you? No, I'll come for it. All right, then. I'll have it here for you. Laura. I know the doctor is there. If, um... If the police are there, say-- - Yes. - All right. I want you to tell them something for me. Tell them that I will be there for the money in the morning and that Annie will be with me. And I wouldn't want anything to happen to Annie, Mother. So be alone. You got that? Alone. Ask him where he is. I am at the opera seeing Carmen. Tell him that. He's at the opera, seeing Carmen. Goodbye, Mother. I've killed you, but you still exist, don't you? Did he say he's coming here? He'll be here tomorrow morning, with Annie. If I had a father, I'd like him to be just like you. Well, I'd like to be your father. And your friend. Your playmate. [eerie music] [upbeat music] Hey, listen, that's why I'm calling, because, uh... [chuckles] I can't. I'm not going to be able to come home for dinner. That's all. I just can't. Huh? Honey, that's not it. That's not the point. I love you. Of course I love you. I love you. Honey. It's about-- It's a kid. It's a little girl. Yeah. Yeah. Some maniac [indistinct]. Yeah. God, I love you. Yeah, I do. I do. Yeah. I'll be home as soon as I can. Okay. Good night.

What? Don't pay any attention to him. What did you say? You just spoiled my shot. Yeah? I said this reminds me of the pool room at Arles in the Van Gogh painting. In the what? He meant it as a representation of the dissolute life. But the result is warmth and beauty. What's with him? Forget it. He talks fruity. Go on, make your shot [balls clacking] Missed. You don't control your cue. And you can't control your mouth. Now beat it. She belongs to me. - Is that your father? - No, it's not my father. Did you know that my family has been in business for 75 years and that my grandfather was nominated for governor of his state? Yeah. Where was that? Connecticut. Did you know my grandfather was George Washington's horse? - Why do you talk to him? - "Why do you talk to him?" You rich or something? My family has five factories and 30 stores at least. - Prove it! - Why should I want to prove it? Because I think it's a stupid lie and you made it all up. Will you forget him and stop talking to him? Let her talk to anybody she wants to. You're not her father. You think I'm lying? I don't think, I know. Why don't you go to that phone and prove it? Who would I call? Just call someone who says this guy knows what he's talking about and he's rich. Does the name Robertson mean anything to you? Yeah. Nothing. Here. Cards. Identification. Pick it up now, would you? No. You get out of here and leave her alone. Look, am I bothering anybody? Van Gogh painted the pool room at Arles because he was interested in people. Is that so wrong? Listen to me. You leave this room with him, I'll put this stick over your head! Will you? I don't think you will. Why don't you keep this for me? You're not going to do that, are you? You said you wouldn't do that. Will you shut up? I'll be back in a few minutes, okay? All right. Just keep the table, okay? I don't like it. And you said that your grandfather was a governor once? Nominated. Just nominated. Well. Let's go talk about it. Well. Now you believe I'm rich? But I see it. - See what? - The money. Do you want a drink first? All right. Got you okay. [laughs] [glasses clink] You said you were rich. I didn't say I was rich. I said my family was rich. Just a minute. You said you had money, and I'd like to see a little bit of it right now. - Would you? - Yes, I would. Um... Okay. All right. You see that? You see that? Yeah, I see it. Wait a minute. Wait, wait. Uh. I want you to do something first. What do you want me to do? I feel like dancing a little bit. Come on, let's dance. - Right here? - Yeah, sure. Come on. Come on.
