Other people's money. Great. It's great. You're all wimps. We don't have work, alright but... that's not an excuse for treating us like outcasts. They fired me, and in style... they said "Thank you, sir." Here, no one talks to us. Who do they think they are? But indeed... we're all wimps if we let them treat us like that. When they fired me... they said "Thank you, sir." They shook my hand. Not you? Sir... For more than a century our bank has successfully avoided scandals. For more than a century our fathers could be proud of their sons. That century is the past, now is a different time. The carelessness of a few could jeopardize our prestige. We have to be merciless and thus save our 800 employees. I have to be merciless with myself first. In charge of the banking department... I let unfortunate events happen. I couldn't prevent complacencies... I lacked discernment. Please accept my resignation. We accept it, you will leave that charge. Yet, you keep your place on the board which you owe to your family. As for you Rainier... when checking your work, we saw seriously careless and perilous actions... in the management of the Chevalier d'Aven Group's finances. This professional malpractice is exceptionally serious... and can only result in... your dismissal. You'll leave the bank this instant. What is that? What is this? Your personal belongings. Let me do it. But they're mine. -You'll have them later. These are personal. You will have them back... But it's mine. The schedule book wasn't yours. Alright. Where do we go? Fantastic, let's go. Something's wrong? I was just wondering if you could drive with the boat on tow. Well. Shit. You need help? I can't reach the big trunk. What sweaters do I pack for you? Take them all. How about your rackets, do I take them? Take them. Papa. I wanna go out. Are you going out dressed like this? Fine, go. I love you. You never wear this one. It's pretty though. Take it then. Don't you think you could finish earlier? It's not up to me. See you tonight. -Yes. Could you get my binoculars from grandma's? Is that all? I can't find my tennis balls, please Mom. Mr. Miremant. You're not an employee anymore... the window please. In our recruiting agency, show us your best side, we'll bring it out. I was in charge of the forecasts. And you? -Me? I was fine. My name is Marguerite Levrier. And you? -Rainier. I'm Henri Rainier. Hi. -Hi. Your last position? Proxy-holder at the Miremant, de Nully & Heldorff Bank. Were you fired or did you decide to go. We agreed to end the contract. Can you afford to wait? I had money but now it's been eight month, that's long. Maybe you were a bit bold in leaving that position. Yes. It had been too long, I think I was under underemployed. You think you had a moral obligation to leave. Yes, precisely, a moral obligation. What were your responsibilities precisely? I had two functions. First, I had to prospect new clients... and second follow personally our regular clients. About a hundred of them who, for the most part, had become my friends. When they needed a loan, I would help them to file. I had a lunch every day. By the time we reached the cigar, the file was wrapped up. Could you allocate loans? Oh, not at all. I had to submit my clients' files to the board every week. The committee was deciding. As you see, the session is over. I haven't spoken yet. -Too late, I have three files. Pass them to Delarue, he will check them. The funny part is that I hate to loan money. Do not play with the mic, please. What is your expected salary? Oh, not so much. Did you ever fire. Your client doesn't like to lie. That's neat. Yes. Any job will do, I can't afford ambitions anymore. Find me any job, I'll adjust. Ask him question #27. Would you rather order or obey? You order here, you obey there. Do you think a woman is at a disadvantage as an executive? I can easily forget that I am a woman. Except in some circumstances, obviously. I think he's ripe now, get him back. Considering your expenses, your decision to leave was a bit risky. Life involves risks. I had enough. I have ruined your table mat. What bothers me is that I can't see you. You must be pretty. It's annoying to talk to walls. We'll come see you. Is it better like this? Let's have a look at you in the waiting room. Confident from the start, not surprised that you weren't asked anything. Serene, your usual serenity. Was serenity the correct way to deal with the situation? 'The correct way'? I don't know what the correct way is. If you know it, just tell me. Why would you alone know it? What are those criteria that you only would know? Fine... I think I'd better go now. Excellent, Mr. Rainier, excellent attitude. Please miss, take Mr. Rainier to the waiting room. What's happening to me? I can't answer to that. I was told to not give you any documents. You're just betraying me. You'll leave the bank this instant. I hope no harm will befall you. Really, are you serious, that's a first. I'm too old to play domino. Uh-oh. We're like squeezed lemons. No eyes, no seeds. Just good enough to clean fingernails. Washing fingernails with lemon, it's really efficient. Tell them "The strike is over"... "Don't unduly worry your spouses." "They won't care if you won the strike." "They'll just be relieved." "I can bet you that." Thank you, Madame. It's really me know. I knew it was you. Next candidate. Thank you. You are firing a department manager that you had hired... because he forged his resum√©. I can't play that. Why did you lie to us? Among the hundred clients I was taking care of at the bank... one of them you probably heard about. I lost my position because of him. His name is Chevalier d'Aven. Chevalier d'Aven. A man who ran away. -Yes. They fired me as if I was his accomplice. While I had nothing to do with these events. But the problem is, as long as I drag this episode like a millstone... I won't find a new job. That's why I lied. Allow me to plead for myself. Please ask questions. You'll judge for yourselves if I did my job correctly. Ask away. You don't need questions, just talk. Could you help me. Tell us what you lost. Entering in Miremant's office I was happy. And Miremant was happy when Chevalier d'Aven entered. This is what I liked, it was my life. I thought it would last forever. Dear Rainier, I'll entrust you with a secret. Before making an important decision or touching a woman... I always wash my hands. I think we should trust Chevalier d'Aven. He has dignity, he's unexpected. Here we manage funds, we lack imagination. While he dreams and he creates. How do you get along with him? Very well, sir. -That's what he said, he likes you. Did he talk about us? About the bank? -Yes. He mentions you as a reasonable partner. Just reasonable? Reasonable... likable. And reliable. And 'I' - not 'we' - Have decided to listen to him... one hour a week, we'll see, of course you'll come. In short, dear Rainier, I'll trust you from now on... to always tell me what Chevalier d'Aven thinks of me. That's what I liked. To be intimate with Miremant... a professional intimacy. You don't say 'the smell of a flower'. But 'the perfume of a flower'. 'The perfume of a flower', that is the concept. An exotic and magical perfume... coming from the Antigua's, the locals rub their body with it. It evokes rum, sugar, sunshine, girls. What's the cost? Almost nothing. Could be a good idea. The idea is the rubbing. Useful associations are the associations of ideas. A man who's back doesn't ache anymore... as anyone, thinks about his wife, his lover, his mother. And he regrets that perfumes can't be recorded like pictures. Mr. Miremant, remember the perfume of your mother's blouse. If you could buy it and keep it. Wouldn't it be wonderful? One study group would suffice. If you could enclose a woman's perfume into a box. Because our clients as anyone love what is enclosed. And... don't worry this is my last idea. Remember the Morice line. 460 km of barbed wire separating Algeria from Tunisia. Perfectly preserved. I asked the locals, you can buy them for nothing. What would we do with it. We'd sell it to countries without a natural border. Not every country has the Pyrenees mountain chain. We'll sell them their border. Take for example, the Libyans, wouldn't they love a prickly, scary border? I asked the locals, they just need a few francs upfront. You are sharper than your father, dear Claude. How much would you like as a start? As a start... I would just need... maybe around 3 million Francs. These are the funding forecasts. 3 Million Francs. I'll consult with my associates. Rainier will tell you. I almost forgot to show you... isn't it beautiful? "Isn't it beautiful?" And the project materialized? -Absolutely. With profit? -No. It's amazing that all the companies lost money. In 6 years Chevalier set up about 20 companies. All losing money. -But you knew that. No, I didn't know. Surely you peeped into your clients' books. The accounts were always balanced, the bank was replenishing to cover up. Chevalier never told me, "Please get me 200 million." "Please ask for a loan." He was going over my head to Miremant. You surely know since you were present when they met. I knew only what they'd allow me to hear. I never presented a loan request for Chevalier to the board. Ah, right, I almost forgot. The first time Miremant met Chevalier d'Aven. Mr. Miremant, I never failed you. My son is taking over my business. You know how healthy it is, he wants to expand. What do you have in mind? Well. All over the world, construction works stop when cranes break down. My idea would be to keep back up cranes. I buy them on a leasing on credit... I rent them for an expensive fee, for 2-3 days. No one has a spare crane in France. Not even in the world. -How much do you need? 300,000 F. Rainier, see if it is possible. That was the only request sent through the board, and they signed it. The only one of his companies that was profitable. The first and the last. That project probably encouraged Miremant to finance the following projects. Until he realized that Chevalier owed the bank 3 billion. But that 3 billion gap? It nearly got filled. You see, Estate Legacy inspires trust. I think we've won this time. See, you were reluctant. -Indeed, I didn't dare. Maybe it was not such a good idea to set it next to this bank. It's a bit late. They could see it as a challenge. We offer a 15% interest, more interesting than their 6.5%. There, 340 subscribers this morning. And 125 inquired. And weeks later, Chevalier was celebrating the victory of Estate Legacy. Ladies & Gentlemen during the first part of our flight... Mr. Chevalier d'Aven will offer you a little show. Dear friends, thank you for keeping your word. I'm very happy to celebrate with you the first billion of Estate Legacy. I couldn't have mustered the courage to succeed without you. I hope this cruise of friendship will create excellent memories. Have a nice trip Speculation. Inflation. Devaluation. Dabadabah-dadamda. Estate Legacy Stupefaction, confirmation... despair. Estate Legacy is the promise land for savers. French people prefer stone... real estate accessible to all savers. Estate Legacy gathers your money. Buy in real estate that will turn into... offices, parking lots, stores... when you subscribe for 1000 F you earn 150 F/year. Buildings erected everywhere... they're gold bars... join Estate Legacy now. 15% of interest. Mr. Chevalier. Mr. Chevalier is reliable. He's full of money and so kind. Mr. Chevalier I'd like to live with you... you're not bad looking, not bad at all. And he likes local girls. Once the cruise ended, the trouble started. What had happened? The 15% interest that Estate Legacy and related company promised... drew many subscribers. So much so that no one was going to the savings bank. So, the Minister of finances reacted brutally... and decided to dissolve all these private companies. But Chevalier had expected that. Deputies from the political majority were on his board of directors. But even these deputies, to avoid suspicions... had to vote a law against Estate Legacy... that could even send some of them to jail. How did that law harm Estate Legacy? When they voted the law, Estate Legacy had gathered 4 billion. The law compelled Chevalier to account for these billions. Indeed, he had bought 20 buildings for renovation and rent as per plan... but that accounted for only 2 billion. The rest had disappeared. -How disappeared? Disappeared... at the bank people would say "they disappeared". No one said how it happened. And so... Chevalier d'Aven had become a rogue client... and in the bank, I turned into 'the suspect'. Can't be. You haven't seen the Chevalier d'Aven file. No. Mr. Bignon, did you take the Chevalier d'Aven file? I would never do that Mr. Rainier, it's not me. Please, give it back to me. Don't ask for this Mr. Rainier... I don't have it anymore. My orders are to not give you any documents. I realized then, they'd been on my case for a while already. I still couldn't figure out why. What is happening to me? You could knock at the door. Sorry, what's going on? What? Chevalier just sabotaged us and you're surprised to be ostracized? But you know I'm not responsible. You had charge of a privileged client, that made you Miremant's pet... Chevalier goes to jail and you go to hell. That's clear. You're gonna fight for me. My friend, the priority is to fight for the house. But you introduced me in this position. 15 years, you never complained about it. And please sort your books out because I'm ordered to check your accounts. I'll make sure nothing unfortunate happens to you. You guys are all crazy. Yes, yes Mr. President. That's my file. Miremant just called, the cops are already here. The cops? That is, the financial brigade, there, come on. Did the Brigade interrogate you? Yes, and I told them what I knew then. Not much in fact. And the day of the power outage... Mr. Miremant wants to see you. You'll leave the bank this instant. Porter, sir? Yes, to the lockers. Why the lockers? I didn't want to bring documents home. I didn't want to worry my wife before she goes on holidays. It was too soon to bring it up. I let her go without telling her. I still hoped everything could be fixed. I was sure they'd call me the next day. So, you weren't offended? You didn't have the least impulse to fight back? No. I was mostly disappointed I think. Disappoint at Miremant. I thought I was his prot√©g√©. That as long as he was alive, I was safe. Sorry to bother you I think I left my guns in your car. You want to come in? You came to tell me it's fixed? No, no it can't be fixed. What did I do? -You didn't do your job. Me? But how so? Your Chevalier d'Aven fooled us. You should have blown the whistle. You guys kept funding him from the start, not me. And he's not 'my' Chevalier d'Aven. Surely you saw we were behaving stupidly. And so? You should have told us, it's simple. An executive must keep an eye on his boss... otherwise he sells himself cheap, loses authority. He treats himself like shit. You keeping an eye on Miremant? I'm rather keeping an eye on what he does. That's what I'm paid for. I wasn't paid for it. -Yes, you were, at your level. Did you notice he was often asking if everything was fine? You let Chevalier go to your head and Miremant was disappointed. In me? -Yes. He told you so. Yes, he told me, Chevalier himself blames your negligence. You should have been a guard not and accomplice. What are you leading to? I think you understand. Sure, Miremant's authority is overbearing on the staff. Not because he's infallible, but because of the burden of his duties... which are ours too. Considering him infallible just amounts to betray him. My guns are in your trunk? To hell with them all. You're not giving back my guns? Get out, I didn't betray anyone, get out. Very clever this Mr. Vincent. Remarkable, is he free lately. No. You disagree with him. Some is right, much of it is wrong. I know now, someone opened my eyes about Mr. Vincent... and about his Mr. Miremant. Hello sir. Ah, thanks, I'm gad to see you. It seems that I should apologize to you. What? It seems I should have told you and Miremant, "Beware, you're careless" Who's the clown who fed you that story up? Sit down. That's a bad joke. They pin on you their own misdeed. They played into my hand, we were accomplices. They freaked out and dumped me to get out of it with dignity. And left behind a big turd that they want you to bear. Thank you. -What is it? It's something you ordered. -Open it. Why do you say they dropped you? Have you ever wondered where the 2 billion went? "2 billion disappeared into thin air" as the media phrase it. When the law fell, and the Minister of finance saw the books... there's no denying it, I'm the subscribers swindler... but it doesn't explain everything. When Miremant et al saw these tons of money, they grabbed it eagerly. First to cover the overdraft of my other companies. And they took 2 billion. no, they took 1.5 billion. Yes, my friend, they took the subscribers money. Instead of waiting for me to refund them. The new law freaked them out. But they were warned before me. How could they lay their hands on that money? Obviously, you don't know much, it's quite simple. They had me sign a blank transfer order... which is strictly illegal towards the subscribers. Thus, I gave them all power... to grab as much as they wanted whenever they wanted. Even from the money of the subscribers. So, they used that blank transfer order. Yes dear, that's why 2.5 B went missing. And so, I say they betrayed you. Why did you sign that blank order? If I refused they threatened me of bankruptcy on all my companies. Me the Prince of subscribers, in bankruptcy. Thank you. -What is it? I don't know, sir. -Open it. You see, Rainier, unlike you, I like to know. I asked you to come because of that blank order. You absolutely need to get it back. I'll be thrown in jail anyway. But it is proof that they bilked out the subscribers using my signature. And proof of your innocence, two birds with one stone. We were accomplices, sorry, you were not included. They're blankets. Wow, great, I'm sure I'll need it there. You look surprised. We are departing soon, excuse me sir. Wake up Rainier, the train starts soon. It's time to get mad. Yes. I was disgusted... I realized I was done with the bank. I had been their scapegoat... it couldn't be fixed anymore. I needed to talk with my wife. She was still on holidays, I called her to tell the whole story. Her voice soothed me. Did you talk about it to Vincent? The bastard, I see his wife every day, she didn't breathe a word. So, what now? You apply at another bank? What? You, a suspect? you won't let them do, we'll fight back. See you tomorrow, we'll talk it over. Obviously, we're going home, I'm not lounging here while you... She helped me back on my feet. I requested a disciplinary hearing from the bank to hear what I was guilty of. My questioner was my friend Vincent. As you know, I wasn't managing the Chevalier d'Aven books. I never took a decision. Your signature is on all account-to-account transfers. Of course, it's my signature, you know darn well why. Every time there was a problem, the clerk would come to me. Then I called you and after your OK I'd sign. But it's your signature, not mine on the transfers. Don't play with your signature. It was a routine signature. I never signed anything without your agreement or Duval's. And so, the agencies that should have controlled the bank were kept away. But Duval was analyzing the position sheet every day. Well, Mr. Duval is not here to answer. Should I tell why Mr. Duval is not here? He's away in Spain because he's the brother of the Minister's Secretary. We shouldn't introduce politics into this debate. You're all hooligans. Of course, we won't talk about the blank transfer order. What transfer order? So, you haven't found it yet? No, but I'll find it. If it exists. I'm positive it exists. In other words, now you trust Chevaliers words? The way you used to trust Mr. Miremant's words. Yes. So, you always need to trust someone? Not you? How are you all built up? On a different pattern? I heard you well Mr. Rainier. I can't say your friend Vincent is right in this matter but... but he's right generally speaking. Despite all our sympathy, we don't find you skilled for responsibilities... so we can't select you as a candidate. You'd be better fitted in PR. No doubt you know how to dine. Am I wrong? Maybe you have a deeper understanding than you let know... about the operations at the bank. No. I see what you mean, I was either competent and dishonest... or I'm a complete idiot. Simple. What was going on above was none of my business. So, you were a bad guardian angel. I wasn't a guardian angel I was just a bank clerk, damn you. I'm just looking for a job. Don't bother me with your managerial metaphysics. The hell with the guardian angel. It is all silly. I hoped to convince you. Next candidate, please. The train is entering the station. C√©cile? C√©cile? No, I'm not upset. We'd like to sleep here. Please. The girls wanted to go to the movies. They'd better be in bed at this hour. It was great, you know. Who were you talking to? To the neighbors. Girls, go to bed. So? Nothing. You had dinner. You want a drink? Sure, I'd like a whisky, please. So, what did they say? they thought Vincent was a great guy. Oh? You see. Those guys who open their cigar box... they take one... and never offer you one. It's been like that all day. It's obvious they have lots of positions... but they close back their cigar box. Yes. You were right. As usual. Clear your head of that tonight. You'll tell me it all tomorrow. Yes. You know... at the station I saw a great elderly couple. There was love in each other's eyes. I didn't dare but I wish I asked them: How did your couple hold so well? Together for so long? Many couples are strong. Can't be that difficult. We'll make it. I don't mind becoming a little old lady... you'll be a little old gentleman. It's fast. It's slow. It's fast. do you know Miss Arlette Rivi√®re? I don't think I had the pleasure. You're so formal, we've met 50 times at least. Where? At the bank, I work in the computer department. That's right, I remember now. Grant me this is unexpected. How do you know my wife? But I knew Miss Rivi√®re even less than you did. Could you explain? Very simple, I called the bank. And I told them, "I'm Mrs. rainier, may I speak to a union representative? ". The receptionist asked me if I was your wife. I said yes, she asked me which union I wanted, I said I didn't care. And she connected me to Miss Rivi√®re. I think I was lucky. Your wife told me everything the blank transfer order would be great but we need a copy. Do you know if Bignon saw it? He's the archivist. I asked him. He said he didn't know. It's possible that Chevalier made up a story. Maybe the order doesn't exist. If it didn't exist he'd have called bullshit. You think so? We'll have to have a copy one day. We'll get it, we'll manage something with Bignon. We can't twist his arm. The poor old fellow would get the ax. We should break into the archives. Any other great idea? So, what do you plan to do, Sweet pie? Sweet pie? That's how they call you at the bank. Sweet pie? It's rather cute. Maybe too cute. I think I'm gonna get nasty. Would be better because the Bloody Big Head is a hooligan. That's how you call Miremant? -Who else? First, we must fight to get a joint commission... where 12 union people meet 12 directors. That would be better. Then you'll take them to the labor court. Alright? Alright. Bloody Big Head is a hooligan. Does it hurt to hear that? What hurts is how naive I was for 15 years. You regret you believed him. To be honest... I regret that time. And I hate it too. The funny thing is, you are still the scapegoat there. So tomorrow it will be the same at the joint commission? Here he comes, it's Torrent. Going for lunch. See you at the commission, sure the issue is the same... but we'll be 12 union people meet 12 directors. The union people are on your side if you bring witness friends. My friends? How many do you need? Two at least. -Daniel is coming? Right. What did Torrent tell you exactly? He said "Maybe". -Maybe? Thank you, Torrent. I know how hard it is for you to take side. I told Miss Rivi√®re I 'might' go. We need 12 against 12 votes... if there's only one witness I fear a union guy would fails us. And what then with those 12 votes? I go to labor court where I'll win. Alright I'll go. Thank you, Torrent, thank you. Bignon made a move, he admits he saw it. Then it is in his pocket. You think Derive will come? I don't think he can take that risk, he's in debt. He's in a weak position towards the bank. Tomorrow, at 9. -Thank you. Thank you, Torrent, I regret. What? That I didn't befriend you earlier. You were Vincent's friend. -True. You were side tracked. No need to wait, it's going to take all day. I know but I want to know who wins. Any news from Derey? This way Ladies & Gentlemen. Are they all here? The commissioners? Yes. I'd like to see Mr. Qu√©uzac, if I may. Mr. Qu√©uzac retired two years ago. I'm sorry. How about Mr. Chicalsky? Retired 5 years ago, his replacement Mr. Letord went too. Too bad, I don't know anyone here anymore. You know everybody. I've worked here 20 years. And you are? Rainier. I see. Are you waiting for someone? Yes, Mr. Derive. -He won't come by now. Mr. Simon. -Exactly. I'm glad you came. -Hello. You found easily? I did. I can't get used to this neighborhood. I read your article last night. Very interesting. -Thank you. Miremant looks embarrassed. And I didn't say it all. Miremant's cousins in Switzerland threaten... to withdraw their funds if the light is not shed on the affair... to the advantage of the bank. Of course... they hate scandals there. If they withdraw, the bank loses its autonomy. Absolutely, that's what this is about. The Swiss Cousins own 42% of the shares. Thus, Miremant's panic. Since Chevalier d'Aven was arrested the public is paying attention. I guess you know why I want to see you? Good morning, sir. Am I disturbing? -Not at all. Probably because of the commissions votes. What? you haven't been told? It was 12 votes against 12. 12 union people unanimously claimed my innocence. I didn't know. No, I came because the bank is pressing charges against unknown persons. They're pressing charges? Yes. You didn't know. Shit. Seeing your reaction, the unknown person has to be you. Who else? How do you plan to react? I don't know. I'll be honest. I should be glad because the file I have gathered... will be passed to a judge. I really want to be trialed, you see. Your file is ready? Not yet. Well. What are you going to write, sir? I still don't know. You used to live in a mansion, right? Yes sir, with a garden. Goodbye. -Goodbye, sir. The bank's pressing charges doesn't make you guilty. It scares me. Not me. I often told you to hire a lawyer, now you'll have to. You didn't have to be so cold with that journalist. It's an important newspaper. -I wasn't cold. Cold enough. You don't realize when you're cold. You'll have to find another wife then. Come on, this joke is awkward. Really, you're ready to take a new wife? How do you think I feel? I haven't worked in 8 months. Do I have to take it lightly? -It's not what I meant. You're not getting used to it. -To what? I don't know, like, our lack of money for example. Oh, I see, I'm careless, I buy too many flowers... too much food, too many dresses... -Goodness. And I'm neglecting you. -It's not what I meant. You haven't changed your way of life. Going out, seeing friends. You have become isolated. The few friends we have left. We are not outcasts after all. As long as I don't work, I am an outcast. And you're busy keeping up appearances. -Heard that one, thanks. We can't stay here with the girls staring at each other. Living like moles won't... -Course not. You could have been warmer with that journalist. Now, go figure what story he'll write. Then you'll take one more lawyer, or the same... and you'll sue him. what can I say? Laurence. I didn't know you were here. That's my day. Look what the bastard wrote. The guy who came here? Yes, read. Where? Encircled in red. A 2.5 billion gap. After inquiry the directors of Miremant bank have discovered... that a proxy-holder, Mr. Henri Rainier, was responsible in the affair. Is that true? -No. So why do you mind. -I know it's not true. But the readers will think I stole money. Not granny. -Not granny. But potential employers. Presidents, managing directors. Are they all gonna read this? Of course. So, it's disgusting. It's embarrassing to have an unemployed dad. Not that much. -Really? I didn't know what you were doing at the bank. One day I asked but you ignored me. And now, you're not always right. How so? Since you've been fired, you're less unfair. 'Less unfair'? But you're still too serious. You have free time, instead of enjoying it, you still wear a suit. That's silly, you should listen to your records. How about that journalist? What should I do, Miss? Why don't you break his jaw? You don't want to get that? I work with Bernard, I didn't do his translation. Tell him I'm not home. Maybe it's another dimwit journalist who knows I'm going to court. But what if it was Arlette? We'll call her tomorrow. What if it was S√©n√©chal? He won't call back. I saw it on his face. He won't lend us a cent. Maybe your lawyer. He called three times today. I think the newspaper will lose. -Our libel case? I'd be surprised. If you're not taking it, I won't. Hello? It's you? You know how late it is? I don't think it's Bernard. Neither S√©n√©chal. Nor the lawyer. Nor anybody. Yes, they agree. The others are coming? See you at the pool tomorrow. Mr. Chevalier d'Aven will sit here. We need a chair for Mr. Duval too. Duval. Your Honor may I be at ease? Thank you. We can start. Mr. Miremant. Mr. de Neuilly. -Sorry, it's de Nully. Mr. Duval, thank you for accepting to come all the way from Spain. That's where I live. As plaintiff please tell us why you are pressing charges. Pressing charges is for a victim. Our bank and its shareholders that we shouldn't forget... have been victims of a fraud which is the object of another case. But that fraud was damaging for us... because it's been facilitated, if I may say... by an inside complicity, by one of us. Our proxy-holders are usually responsible for their client. Unfortunately, Mr. Rainier didn't face his responsibilities... with Mr. Chevalier. I'm listening. When I was called in front of the board and fired unfairly... I witnessed a very... puzzling scene. Mr. Duval in charge of the banking department... - so that makes him my boss -... stood up and publicly admitted... to his malpractice and offered his resignation. And Mr. Miremant accepted his resignation. I'm telling you this episode your Honor... because it clearly states my case. I never did anything that wasn't first approved by Mr. Duval. What am I accused of? Of my boss's incompetence? Failing to see Mr. Rainier's misdeed was the point of Mr. Duval's incompetence. What misdeed? Chevalier's books always looked good while they were irregular. You were making up the books, it was your fault. The make up was in replenishing the financial gaps every month. I was in no position to make such decisions. Who then was deciding? I was, with your agreement. You're deluded. -Not at all. That is a personal attack against me... us, that is intolerable. The question is, should we tell the truth here? You should. I object to was Mr. Duval said. You don't throw such accusations, you have to prove them. Well, I have to state it first. -Enough. I'll be the judge if that is enough or not. Forgive me. And the credit to Mr. Chevalier? Who was granting the loans. -I was. The board had to agree first. If you want to be precise... you can say you never provided accurate information on Mr. Chevalier. Mr. Miremant is blaming me for providing... -For 'transmitting'. Mr. Rainier was 'providing' the data. These files were exact. No, they were all implying Mr. Chevalier's solvency. I admit that my companies backed by the bank were not successful. I was unlucky. -Let's talk about luck. They falsified the data. The perfume from the Antigua's was selling well. Yet the company was losing money, simply because... Chevalier's Swiss company was buying for 1 cent and selling here for 100. And his French company was backed up by my bank. While the Swiss company was profitable. You simply didn't know the price. I admit I wasn't lucky but I believed in my luck. And so did you Georges. A 3 billion gap, any bank would try to get it back. you had to compel Mr. Chevalier to file for bankruptcy. But in that case, there was no way to get the 3 B back. And then Mr. Miremant had a great idea: Estate Legacy. I won't let you lie. But your idea was great, we both thought so. The bank even spent one more billion on advertising. Which raised my debt to 4 B. Estate Legacy was going well. Your Honor, Mr. Chevalier just told you an outlandish story. We'll review it at his trial. May I ask an interesting question your Honor? Go ahead. The file in your possession, did it contain... a blank transfer order that I signed for Mr. Miremant? No, and I know your file well. It was to be somewhere. They had it disappear. That is interesting your Honor because... that order that Mr. Miremant compelled me to sign... gave him the right to take as much as he liked from Estate Legacy's subscribers. That's what he did. Do you know how much he took from these clients? 1.5 billion Francs. Dear Georges. This is calumny against me and a century old honest bank. Your accusation is an ignoble lie. Mr. Duval did you see that blank order? No. There, Mr. Duval back with the hat of the good boy. Mr. Miremant? -This misinformation is unbearable. I keep pressing charges. You did not help me much. You're a great liar. We should have given more to Duval. -Or less. Rainier won't get away with it. He had his navy-blue suit. That little judge is a communist. Victims of Estate Legacy. So? How was it? Not too good obviously. Am I in your armchair? I'm fine, keep it. I may indeed do so. Don't think that we, the Swiss cousins, who own 42% of this bank... can keep altar boys who can't even muzzle a scandal. Since I am not your cousin, don't patronize me. You all left Miremant fall for Chevalier. And so, you are all my cousins, all on the same train. To find an inside rogue wasn't a bad idea... but choosing a good guy as a scapegoat who is totally clueless... that was a mistake that will cost you. Your little love story with Chevalier d'Aven... all the bankers in the world are having a laugh. You are the laughing stock of finance. Are you well aware of that? Then I'm asking you. How are you going to turn the tables? Of course, you have no idea. I'm gonna give you a week to get yourself out of it. I'm not worried about the lost billions. Eventually they will come out of your benefits. That's all. What matters is our reputation. If you can't come clean out of it, the Swiss are withdrawing their funds. I'm sure you'll replace us with Libyans eager to embrace Jesus. Here's your armchair back. For eight days. Goodbye Gustave. Goodbye Victor. Bye Henri. So long Hector. I don't think I missed anyone. Blue is a bully. -A bully annoyingly right on the money. We won't let him. We'll call in the account commissioners... they tampered with the books, they're in with us. If we ask them to compromise Rainier, they can't refuse. Don't be so obstinate, Rainier is clean. But he managed one of Chevalier's companies. On your request. And Duval will happily corroborate. His checkbooks are clean too? Pironneau reviewed them ten times. I'm surprised Blue was so soft, he's getting old. He didn't mention that our business is bad, he should know. We're losing to our competitors, we're losing clients. He didn't mention the split within the staff, the unions' squabbles. I think it's time to move boldly. Let's compensate the subscribers. -With what? Money. -Compensating is too much. Let's indemnify then. That's not impossible. One: We indemnify. Two: The stocks of Estate Legacy are worthless. Three: We buy them. Four: We revive the business with our name. And five: We screw Blue. Why not. We'll study that possibility. Let's call Vincent. We'll have to prepare this indemnification. It requires time. But we need to do something quick before. Where need to gain amplitude. We pinned all our trouble on Rainier but... he's too small. Plus, he's fighting back. We should find another scapegoat... for the public. Someone with more influence. Duval is untouchable. The bastard is family. How about Vincent? He's the idiot who told us to fire Rainier. He even said, "Rainier won't fight back." Please send Mr. Vincent to the board. Blue will come see you at the golf. Why? You called me Mr. President. Sit down. You always served the bank with intelligence... but we have to discharge everyone related to the Chevalier accounts. You're aware the I know about all the operations. We are certainly not firing you, Dear Vincent. We want to know the price for your departure. Are you going to sue me? No. But we'll announce your departure to all the colleagues... who will appreciate it. Accepted. If I may. Mr. President. What is it? Mr. Rainier just locked himself in the archives room. What idiot let him in? It's me, Mr. President, I'm sorry. Miss, Miss, come back here. Come in. Come in. Not a word. The employees will be out in 20 min, they can't know. And now stop crying. -I can't, sir. Try. Bignon, which Chevalier file do you have in the archives? That one we showed to the Brigade. The other one is in my safe. So? Please, go get it. You can trust us. How did that happen? He rang, I opened the door. Mr. Rainier looked so happy I thought he was back. He said, "Mr. Pironneau called you." So, I stepped in the corridor, he ran past me. Then he slammed the door behind. And now he's locked in. Where's the key? -The drawer of my desk. I wasn't there. You have only one key? The fireman has one but Mr. Rainier locked the latch. I tried. It's all there. May I go Mr. President? But you stay on this floor, don't let people see you cried. You should try to call Rainier. Why not. Extension 333. Yes, I know that. Hello, please wait. The line is busy. I could call his wife. Yes, he listens to her. May I go Mr. President? Good. We have an incident, I won't be there for dinner. I don't know... I'll call you back. What should Miss Robert do? She stopped crying? No. Vincent, keep her with you. Do you have Rainier's personal number? 921.18.42 what should I do Mr. President? Just show everyone you're going and that everything is fine. Is there a direct number for the archive? 607.22.43 I'll call Mrs. Rainier when the receptionist is gone. Goodness. When does your shift end? At 17:30. Can you operate this? It's my job. Show us the record between 17:00 and 17:15. You may go now. But I don't know who you are. Go. My boss is Pironneau. -I'm President Miremant. But my boss is Pironneau. -Call him. Mr. Pironneau please. Mr. Pironneau it's Daniel. Let me take this. It's Miremant, tell your Daniel to go to hell. Yes, it's Daniel. Mr. Pironneau wants to say something else. What? No, I don't need you. Yes, it's Daniel again. Alright, I'm going. Just show us backward, forward, play, pause. So, this is 'play'. Fast forward is here. This is stop, this is backward. And this is to eject the tape. Serious young man. Fascinating. Isn't it Rainier? No, it's me. -You're right. So, he arrived after us. Shit. Stop. That's him. -See how well we're protected. Pierroux will have an early retirement. Nothing on the second. The third. Stop. We got it, switch it off. -I switch off. Mrs. Rainier? It's President Miremant. Something very serious is happening. Your husband, as we speak, is out of control. I need you to talk some sense into him. Do you understand? Your husband is locked in the archives room. Please call him at the 607.22.43. 607.22.43, it's very serious. You refuse? We're going to call the police. I'm just trying to negotiate before that. Your husband is not spending the night here. I count on you. I heard she was laughing. -Yes. She said it would do him good to sleep out. He never sleeps out, she says. Shit. C√©cile. You know then. I was going to call you when you're back. You OK? I'm having fun. Mr. Rainier. Hang on, the boss is calling. Mr. Rainier. Listening. It's Miremant. Are you still pressing charges? More than ever. We could cut the lights in there. What if he starts a fire? If such risk exists we need to call the police. We're not spending the night here. It's 2 am, I give you a last chance. We'll call the police in an hour. If you call the police, I call the journalist... and I start a hunger strike. Leave me alone. C√©cile are you here? I just found my own file. It's funny. I read the first comment when I arrived, signed by Vincent. "Excellent person, very well wed." Then it gets worse. "He knows how to dine, but no discernment." The last one that Vincent signed too." "I see no objections to his dismissal." "Rainier would not fight back." "He has neither the courage nor the political connections." The phone is ringing, call you back later. No, Mr. President, I don't need money. I don't want anything. It's too late. Are you dropping the charges? Come in. Thank you. Don't be stubborn. If we give up the charges, he'll go, that's certain. No, I'd rather have the cops here. You know that Blue could be back tomorrow. Rainier will be out by then, even by force. Yes, thank you Mr. Bignon. Yes, I'll clean up after me, don't worry. Thank you, Mr. Bignon. It's 4 am Rainier. We're calling the police in an hour. Bignon just called, he gave me the reference of the first file, the original. It contains the blank order. Of course, it's only a copy. Yes, you'll be waiting outside? Your turn. Rainier, this is de Nully. Your father and mine served together during the war. I'm asking you to get out. This is our last appeal. If you don't comply we call the police immediately. Are you dropping your charges? If that's what it takes. Will Mr. Miremant take my good will into account? We'll take your good will into account. I can't tell you more. Yes, if you comply I'll drop the charges. When I get out, shall I be free to go? Yes. A year later. Mr. President. Talking again about that blank order... today, Mr. Miremant is not denying it. He was in denial for months. He hid it from the authorities. Talking again about that blank order... it shows at what high level of responsibility... the bank was colluding with my client Chevalier d'Aven. Mr. Miremant, how do you explain... that this blank order was used? It was carelessness, it happens, I already explained that. The guilty persons have offered their resignation. It was not carelessness... but complicity in fraud. You should on this bench, accused with me. Your Honor, talking for the bank we'll never recover the 2.5 B Chevalier lost. We are his victims too. That blank order alone could have sent you to court. Justice could have sued you, and you know it. That's why you partly indemnified... the subscribers of Estate Legacy, are you denying it? Hadn't you felt guilty towards the 8,500 subscribers of Estate Legacy... would you have indemnified them? This is not the question. It is done, we won. The judge gave his sentence, the newspaper is guilty of libel. It's good, right? Sure, it's a victory, but the public's attention is here. Not for everyone. No, but for the bankers who would hire me. The court can only condemn the bank's attitude in this case. The collusion is obvious. The charges are established but can't be followed by criminal pursuits. The bank won't even be fined. We're screwed. But why? The bank is guilty in this case. How about me, am I going to drag this suspicion all my life? I have a right to justice, and the subscribers too. As long as the bank is not sentenced they are dispossessed... I'll be a suspect, unemployed... -Enough. This is unfair. Sir, you are young but the subscribers are old, we lost our savings. you had to worry before, about what you were doing and with whom. The court sentences Mr. Chevalier d'Aven to 5 years imprisonment. You feel so superior, right? The truth is, I don't feel superior at all. You think you'll work again? No. I still have your guns. Well in any case, if you don't find a job, call me. I think I have a position that would suit you. Congratulations for your action. You are still talking to that man? He came to talk to me. Tell me, poor Vincent... Hi, C√©cile, it's been a while. Henri told me everything. Right. What they did to you was disgusting. Right. Yes, that was disgusting. Although, you did everything they asked. Everything. You are truly a pathetic bastard. Ch√¢teau P√©trus 1947. For a Bordeaux wine, 1947 specially is a great year. And also 1957-59-61... a good meal with a 1961. 1964 for people who mean business. 1966 for people with a sense of humor. 1970 too is good, but still young. 1975 will be a great year. Let us name the first year of our PR school, 'Ch√¢teau P√©trus'. Excellent idea. It won't stain.
