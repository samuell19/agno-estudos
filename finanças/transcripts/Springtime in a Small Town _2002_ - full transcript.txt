Young Master? Young Master? He does need looking after. Forgets his scarf when he goes out. He'll catch a chill. Young Master, you'll catch a cold. Put on your scarf. It's spring! Spring is as changeable as a child's mood. Your mother would still have the winter clothes out. And your father would travel with a trunk. Old Man Heaven can't make up his mind. It's cold one minute and hot the next. I heard the train whistle. Is my wife back? She's still at the market. Take the scarf. It's too hot. It really is spring. Warm weather is good for your health. I fear my health, like this home, is beyond repair Young Master, it's peacetime again. We'll slowly fix this place up You should relax. You look better these last few days. I feel a bit more energetic. Did you order a new prescription? No, I'll keep taking the old one for now. Yuwen? You're back. Yes... did you want something? Uh, no. Did you sleep well last night? Not too badly. It's good if you can sleep. It's thanks to the pills. Why not let Huang do the shopping? I can do it. Did you get all the medicinal herbs? Last time they forgot the conioselinum root. Not that it matters. I don't want to keep taking it It's all there. It must be okay if you haven't changed the prescription. Little sister is coming home for lunch today. Must you? Such a temper. Even I don't know how this happened to me. Yuwen. We need to talk. You're ill. Give me my medicine. Huang! Huang! I think someone's knocking. I'll check. Huang! Huang! Dai Liyan! It's me! Liyan, it's me! Zhang Zhichen! Is that really you? Zhichen? Yes, Liyan. It is you. You look like you've seen a monster! No, it's just that I never dreamed it'd be you. This is great. I never thought you'd visit! It's been how long, ten years? Yes. Where have you been all this time? Hankou, Chongqing, Changsha... Hengyang, Guilin, Kunming, Guiyang. Same path as the War of Resistance? That's right. Young Mistress? I thought I'd find you in Little Sister's room. I had a look. No one's there. If no one's there, no one's there. It's probably children playing a prank. School will be out and Little Sister will be home soon. Yes, she'll be here any minute The rice is ready. Once she's here I'll cook. It'll be ready in no time. Last I saw you, you were off to study medicine I'm a doctor now. A medicine man! Congratulations! And you? I was a refugee, I went to Chongqing. As the eldest son, this place is my responsibility You can see the state it's in. Yes. I could smell a medicinal fragrance from the doorway. 'Fragrance'? My health's a mess. Oh... and I'm married! It's me who should congratulate you then! Young Master, we have a guest? Is that Old Huang? Yes. Old Huang! Goodness, It's the Zhang lad Young Master Zhang! Yes. You look in fine health. Old Huang, you've known us since we were kids. You're very kind. Where have you come from? Shanghai. Ah, that's a big place! I went there once with the Young Master's father. Did you knock at the front door just then? Yes. No one answered so I went round the back. You know this place well. Where are your bags? Oh, will you look at me? Master Zhang, I'll do it. No, don't worry. I've always carried my own bags Huang, tidy up the study for Master Zhang to stay in. Tell my wife we have company. Oh, and kill a chicken for lunch. Alright. Liyan, no need to kill a chicken. You deserve a proper welcome. Do stay. Our young master really has missed you. Alright, I will. I've come specially to see him. The young mistress is embroidering. I'll ask her to come greet our guest. Where's your little sister? At school. She'll be home soon. She must be a young lady by now. It's true. You probably won't recognise her. Young Mistress. Is Sister back? No, but your husband has a guest. He's staying for a few days. We'll have chicken. Fine. He'll be staying in the study. I'll tidy it up. Has he much luggage? No. And we've enough bedding. Good. What's his name? Master Zhang. They were schoolmates. He's a doctor. The young master wants to introduce you. I'll be right there. This is my wife, Yuwen. This is Mr Zhang Zhang Zhichen, an old friend. Yuwen? What are you doing here? I'm Liyan's wife. You know each other? We grew up together. Neighbours. That's great. Let's all go inside and chat. This must be Mister Zhang's bag. Let me. Yuwen, I'll take it. Let me. I'm your friend's wife, your hostess. No, no, please let me. Let Zhichen take it. No need to stand on courtesy. Huang cleaned up the room for you. Great! Fortunately, this courtyard survived the war No one has lived here since my parents passed away. Luckily, after the Japanese bombing, it rained... or the compound would've burnt down and... I don't know how you'd have found me. You still have these! You were first in the class to master the parallel rings. Things are different now. I can't look at these things, it depresses me. You always spent the holidays with us. My parents loved you. Mother asked about you before she passed away. How long have you been married? Eight years? Yes, eight. You're the eldest son. Why no children? I know. I'm 30. But look at my health. Besides, we've had separate rooms for years now. But... did you know her before? Know who? Yuwen - did you know her before your marriage? No, of course not. It was arranged. Is there something inappropriate in her past? No, I didn't mean that at all. She's lovely, great. You'd know. You were neighbours. Brother! Sister-in-law! Young Miss! Where are they, Old Huang? The study in the west courtyard with... Sister-in-law! You're back. What are you doing here? We have a... Brother! No school today or tomorrow! I'm free! How many times have I told you... to act like a lady? You crazy girl. I know. Brother, do we have a guest? Yes. Who is it? Guess. You're an energetic little thing! Don't you remember me? Want to eat sesame crisps? I'll steal some from gran! Brother Zhang! Did you miss me? Calm down. There's dust everywhere Sister, that's not a proper way to greet our guest. What should I do? Shake hands? Alright, shake. Yes, let's shake. We're all grown up now. Master Zhang. Old Huang. Master Zhang! Coming! Come in. My mistress asked me to bring this to you. She's worried about the study's musty smell. Put it down over there. She's very thoughtful. I aired the room out, but it still smells mouldy. She says, replace one smell with another... and told me to take the orchid from her room. She's been looking after it for years. I'll bring you some hot water for tea. No thank you. Tea keeps me up. I don't need to wash my face. You don't need to wash? In a moment. Alright, I'll take my leave then. I do my rounds now. Once I see all's well, I can relax. Thank you, Old Huang. Get some rest. Call me if you need anything. Alright. See you tomorrow. Yuwen? Come in. You shouldn't be doing this yourself. Did Huang forget your hot water? No, I told him I didn't need any tea. Yes, he said you're afraid you wouldn't sleep. I never drink tea at night. Sorry to put you up in such a shabby room. It's fine! There's not much here for you. It's been ten years since we last saw each other. There's candles. The power goes off at midnight I don't need them. I... I?m going to bed. I had no idea you were our visitor. Yuwen. This bed is missing something. No, it's fine. Another blanket - I'll get one. Don't worry! Really. It gets cold late at night. I don't mind. I'll be right back. Yuwen. I'll be right back. What's the real story with his health? He... is he asleep? He's not in danger, is he? No. Will he be alright? Of course. Tell me the truth. His chest sounds fine. It's definitely not TB. Oh. He just gets weaker, and his temper worse. He didn't used to be like this. I think his being ill has made him moody. Is that why you sleep in separate rooms? It was my decision. See you tomorrow. Oh. Yes? Nothing. He should get more sun. The weather was good today. Yes, very sunny. It should be nice tomorrow too. Should be. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Sounds like a siren! They're about to cut the power. Why are you turning on the light? It?ll go off soon anyway. Then... stay a while. The orchid ha a lovely fragrance. See you tomorrow. Brother Zhang! Good morning. C'mon in. Why aren't you at school? It's holidays. Oh. Why the dark circles under your eyes? Oh, probably because I was reading until late. What kind of book keeps you up like that? You wouldn't understand it. Wouldn't I? So it's a book of medicine. Yes, that's right. Brother Zhang, I... Not feeling well? Let me have a look. Brother Zhang, I've a gift for you. It's exquisite. And there's a tree, too. It's a China fir. The grass is so fine. You've the hands of a surgeon. I don't want to be a doctor. What do you want to be then? Dunno. So long as I don't end up like Sister-in-law. What do you mean? Just buying food, embroidering that kind of thing. And raising flowers. She sent over this orchid. I saw it as soon as I came in. It's not good. Why not? It's too fragrant. Flowers ought to be fragrant. She buries her nail clippings in the dirt. That's yukky. Is she bad to you? No, she's great. She's the nicest person in the world I just feel sorry for her. Is your brother awake? He's sunning himself. I better go check on him. There's nothing seriously wrong, is there? How can I put it? I think it's all in his head. He's so moody. Oh, sorry... You're a young lady now. Let's go. Cough again. Good. Breathe in. Breathe out. Good. You can get dressed. Well? Any difference from yesterday? You're fine. Get some more sun. Today, Yuwen suggested I get some sun. Was that your idea? Yes. I've had this cough for so long. I'm sure something's wrong with my lungs. Many things can cause a cough. An emotional state, for instance, or an allergy. You need to undergo tests to be sure. In any case, you should get out and exercise more. What about medicine? It's a first step. If you get more sun, your mood will lift as well. That's good advice. Brother's temper is terrible. Children shouldn't interrupt. See? He's always scolding me. Are you finished with him? Yes, that's all for today. Let's go out and have some fun. Is your homework finished? I want Brother Zhang to go for a walk with me. You should have a look around. It's been ten years. Alright, let's go then. Great! Can Sister-in-Law come with us too? Sure. Sister-in-law, come with us! Brother said you could. Would you like to come along too? Me? Would my health permit? Of course. Good, Yuwen, we're all going! I need to change. It'll be good to get out! Let's go. Careful, Zhichen. You too. I'm fine! Come on, Little Sis. C'mon! Brother, look! There's a hanky over there. It's snagged on the branch. Must have been the wind. Let's go. Hurry, Sister-in-Law. Spring has come... and the earth is pleased. The bees are buzzing... and the wind's in the trees. Ah, spring has come... and the earth is pleased. The bees are buzzing... and the wind's in the trees. It's a beautiful sight. The flowers are in bloom... spring has come, spring has come! The violets are fragrant and bright... spring has come and it's a beautiful sight. Spring has come... and the earth is pleased. The bees are buzzing... and the wind's in the trees. Ah, spring has come... and the earth is pleased. The bees are buzzing... and the wind's in the trees. I worked up a sweat today. I'm so happy, I even had a good appetite. I never thought the cedrela would bloom so early Yuwen, you must be tired. I'm alright. We haven't been this happy for a long time. It's been ages since our last outing. It was great fun. Zhichen should've come to visit a long time ago. Take your medicine while it's still warm. I should try a new prescription. Sister-in-Law! Come in. Sister-in-law, can I use your mirror? When will I have a big mirror like yours? I hardly remember Zhang Zhichen. I was so little. But he's everything he ought to be. So handsome. And he's so... oh, help me, what's the word... What are you trying to say? I mean he's got such an air of... know what I mean? He lives in the big city. He's seen the world. I'm not sure how to express it myself. If my classmates knew, they'd die of envy. None of our teacher even compares with him. They're all infatuated with that oafish Mr Liu. You told me just the other day... how fabulous he was. That was before Brother Zhang came along. Morning! Morning! Going shopping? What would you like for lunch? Whatever you all like is fine. After breakfast, make some excuse... so we can go somewhere... to talk. Where? How 'bout the old wall where we went yesterday? Did you hurt yourself? I'm fine. Where shall we go? Up to you. Why don't you ever have an opinion? You asked me out. I'll go where you want me to. Once, before the war, I asked if you'd follow me... and you said it was up to me. If I didn't want you to come, that was fine too. What if I asked you to come with me now? Are you serious? I didn't wait for you. I didn't leave it up to you. That's my hanky. Is it? The day you came, the wind blew it up there. It happened when I fell asleep. Silly isn't it? I spend whole days up here like that. I'm feeling a little dizzy. Maybe I got too much sun. Do Western-trained doctors take the pulse too? I'm checking your heart-rate. You're not used to the sun. That's why you're dizzy. You'll be fine. Will I get over my illness? Of course. You just need rest. What medicines should I be taking? None. Just look after yourself. Try not to get angry or lose your temper. You mean - at her? I was speaking in general. I don't know how my temper got so bad. It seems alright to me. There's no finer person than my wife, but... my health means our relationship isn't normal. Surely it's fine. You have no idea. She does everything she ought to. You can see that I'm so grateful and so full of regret. I can't cry, but nor can I manage a smile. She weeps alone in her room... and never laughs. She fulfils her duty to me... but she's cold. The more she does, the colder she gets. Do you know what I'm saying? She... wasn't always like this? Zhichen, we've been friends a long time. Please, have a word to her. I had no idea you knew each other. Lf... she'd married you, she'd be better off. Liyan... I'll speak to her. I'll do my best. It's not just because you're here. Liyan is good to me, I know that. When we were married... I forced myself to love him. Then he got ill, and grew strange. At the time I was so distressed... and empty inside. I didn't know what to do. One day, you appeared in my dreams. These last few years, Liyan has become a duty. He's my husband. I have to look after him. But you're the one in my heart. It makes me feel guilty. What can I do? There was a time you weren't so good to me either. Later, good or not, I felt it as good. I couldn't tell the difference. Now you're here and I think... so this is the man who so confused me. Don't... If I can't talk to you about this... who can I talk to? What can we do? Unless - We leave? Unless I leave. Or... he dies. Brother Zhang! Brother Zhang! Brother Zhang! Liyan. Zhichen, my sister was just yelling for you. Was she? I think the whole town could hear. Remember the time when we were messing around... and Father made me stand over there as punishment? Just there. You got a boat and shouted from the canal: 'The Dai boy has to stand till his legs go bowed! ' You kept yelling till my father relented. I'm re-reading Amongst Blossom - first time in years. It's wonderful. Liyan. Yes? I have to leave. Leave? Why? You just got here. Please stay. I wanted to discuss something with you. You know, we have so many empty rooms here. We could fix some up for a surgery. It'd be great. True. I work in someone else's clinic in Shanghai. You see? You could open your own. Yuwen could help out. She wouldn't be so bored. Think it over - no rush. It just occurred to me. But whatever you do, please don't rush off. Do you remember giving me this book? I thought you gave it to me? Is that right? One two three, two two three! Good. You're dancing quite well. Just relax. The more you talk, the less relaxed I get. Alright, take a break. Who else wants to try? How 'bout you? No, not me! Which of you boys would like to try? You? Mr Zhang. I'd like to learn. Good. Ready, begin. One two three, two two three... You're a natural. Alright. Very good. Now ask one of the girls to dance. Who else wants to have a go? I'd like to! Brother Zhang, I want another go. Alright. Let's put on the music, it'll be easier. C'mon, everyone, give it a try! Promise me... you won't go behind Liyan's back to see me. Are you listening? I have... something I want to ask you. How did Little Sister work up such a sweat today? I went to her school with her. Did you have fun? It was alright. It seems... you two have become quite close. I watched her grow up. You haven't seen her for ten years. She's just a kid. And you're happy gallivanting around with a kid? You're lying to me. What are you saying? ...I don't understand. She's Liyan's sister. I'm her sister-in-law. I'm responsible for her. I'll be more careful in the future. Alright. I'll tell Liyan that I've been here. I won't lie to him. See you tomorrow. Don't be angry. I'm just kidding around. I asked Huang to make you some noodles. I'm not hungry. I slept so well. Zhichen's right about sunning myself. Is that so? Yes. I thought you'd be so excited he was here... you wouldn't be able to sleep. How do you feel about Zhichen? What do you mean? What do you think of him? He's your friend, of course he's nice. You know, Little Sister is sixteen this year. You see, I'd like her to wait two years for him. You mean you want him to wait two years for her? Yes, that's right. Is she willing? That's why I'd like you to speak with her. I'm her brother, she'd be embarrassed to talk to me. So you want me to play matchmaker. Just have a word with her. And Master Zhang? Should I speak to him too? No, I'll do that, of course. He might not be willing. But he's got no one else and they get along so well. It'd be a great match. You think so? Yes. I don't want to do it. She's young, and still at school. We shouldn't plant such ideas in her head. Why not? Let's take it a step at a time. I suppose. So you're not taking any sleeping pills at all? No. Yuwen... are you leaving? Don't go. See you tomorrow. So, you're getting married. Nonsense. Stop scaring me. You're thirty. It'd be a joke if you stayed single. Liyan asked me to be your matchmaker. Matchmaker? You really are talking nonsense. Who with? If it's nonsense, why ask with whom? You know, anyway. You? Aren't you getting on well with Little Sister? Don't be silly. What's this all about? It's true. Liyan wants me to set you up. This is absurd! I've done as he asked. Up to you now. Let me know. You're playing games. I'm playing it straight. This is a joke! Doesn't he know how young she is? Today is her sixteenth birthday. When I left, you were sixteen. But we had no matchmaker. So you mean... it's okay to ask for the hand of a 16-year-old? Is that a yes? No. I tell you I'm not willing. Satisfied? Stop torturing me. I've suffered enough. Why didn't I find a matchmaker for us back then? Why not? Maybe you weren't willing to. I was certainly willing. Then why didn't you? Wasn't your mother opposed? My mother's dead now. But... now you've got a husband. So, isn't it good idea to marry Liyan's sister? I don't want you to leave, and yet... I can't go with you. Yuwen! Little Sister, it's your sixteenth birthday. Have a drink You have to toast me. Alright, a toast to you! I can't drink. Try. Liyan, what's a birthday without a drink? The electricity's been off all day. Why isn't it on yet? It's nice like this. Plenty of atmosphere. Where's Yuwen? Sister-in-law. You look so pretty! Yuwen, I want to offer a toast to you. Brother Zhang, it's my birthday! Toast me! I did but you wouldn't drink. Alright, I toast you. See? You drink, I'll eat. Sister-in-law prepared so much food for me. Alright, I'll drink. Sister, remember the game I taught you? 'Luck and long life, success in court, man and wife! You know that game? Alright, let's play. Brother just taught me. I'm not too good at it. Just try. Alright, let's do it. Luck and long life! Three, three, five top scholars! One, one, eight, eight! Is that right - eight? Yes! Let's do it again! Alright! Luck and long life! Three stars above! One, one! That doesn't count. Start again! If you lose, you drink. C'mon, drink up. Brother! I wasn't a good enough teacher I'll drink! No, Liyan, you shouldn't. I'll drink for Liyan and Little Sister. Thank you, Sister-in-law! Brother Zhang, let's do' Scissors-paper-rock' Alright! Scissors! Paper! Rock! You lose! Again! Again! Scissors! Paper Rock! You lose again! You're quite the opponent! Drink up, Brother Zhang! Take it easy! Again! Brother Zhang, again! No, no, I give up! Brother, Brother Zhang lost again! He's not going anywhere. Let him have a bite or two. Liyan - let's play that Sichuanese game. The one called 'One Crab Eight Legs'? That's it! I'll give it a try! One crab, eight legs, two eyes and a big shell... head in head out who can tell! Five(Seven)crabs-who drinks? Four crabs-who drinks? Two(Three) It's been years! Liyan, let me. I'll do it. Old Huang! Yes? Drink for me! Yes, Old Huang can drink. Good, Old Huang will drink for you My master can't drink. But my mistress puts it away! Are you really alright with it? I never could out-drink her in the past. C'mon Old Huang, play a drinking game. I couldn't possibly. C'mon, Old Huang, play! Alright, but no getting out of it-the loser drinks up! Old Huang, let's do it! Luck and long life! Five golden heads! Old Huang won! Sister-in-law, he won! I'm terribly sorry, Master Zhang. Thanks, Sister-in-Law! We'll pour. Your face is so flushed! Today's your birthday. I should toast you. Sister-in-law, I want to have some now. It's awful! Give me some. I should have a glass. I'll drink with you! Alright. C'mon! Zhichen! Sister! I'll play with you! Alright, c'mon! No, not 'luck and long life'. I mean this, this... Oh, I know that one. We played it all the time. But you didn't often win! Sister-in-law won! Brother Zhang, drink up! Again! Hold on. Let's use the big cups. Why not! Old Huang. Yes. Bring us the big cups. C'mon Old Huang, we want the big cups! Here we go, I'll pour. Let's do the drinking game. You've never won that one. Two out of three. The loser drinks three big cups It's a deal. Luck and long life! Eight horses, husband and wife! Seven plum blossoms, success in court! Luck and long life! Seven plum blossoms, husband and wife! Three stars above! Eight horses, husband and wife! Success in court! Luck and long life! All together now! Six six wins! Sister-in-law won! Three cups for Brother Zhang! I'll drink one with you! Alright! Another round! Sure! You on? Yes! Brother Zhang, you're drunk! I... Little Sister, remember... you're only sixteen once! You're drunk. I'm taking Sister-in-law to her room. Brother Zhang! You're going out? Go away! I want to come in. Go away! I want to come in! Go away, Yuwen! Who's there? Me, Zhichen. Come in. It's not locked. What's up? I need a pill. I've got a headache from drinking. They're in the drawer on your left. Got it. I should have another one too. It's not good to take too many. Mind turning off the light? The cord's on your right, by the door. Is that Zhichen? It's me. Oh, what's up? I want one of your pills. You too? Strange. No one can get to sleep tonight. Sleep well. Yuwen, you shouldn't drink so much. It's bad for you. Stay a while. Since Zhichen's been here... it's been so lively. I've been in such a good mood. You're wearing your wedding dress. I almost forgot what it looked like. Maybe I've forgotten our marriage as well. You drank so much. I've rarely seen you that happy Today I finally realised how good that is. You're still in your prime, and beautiful. I was thinking... I really ought to get better... so we can live with hope in our hearts again. I thought about it a lot. Sometimes I think... I shouldn't be your husband. Tell me, are you in love with Zhichen? Tell me the truth. What's with your hand? I hurt it. How'd that happen? Have you applied a dressing? I've got some salve from Yunnan. Is it deep? Be careful of infection. Why are you going on at me like this? It's getting warmer all the time. How's your head? You really can drink! Liyan, I have to go back to Shanghai. Sit down. I thought of leaving you a note... but couldn't go without saying anything. You mustn't go. We need you here. Your illness isn't that serious. If you come see me, I'll give you a proper checkup My staying here isn't serving any purpose. Your presence makes Yuwen very happy. I almost did a bad thing. Please trust her. It was my fault Stay another day at least. Seeing her so happy... makes me happy too. Young Master... would you like a snack? Young mistress just bought them. They're very tasty! Young Master? Young Master? Young Master? Young Mistress! Young Mistress! Young Mistress! What? The young master, he... this is terrible! Hurry! Liyan! Give him air! Quick, call Master Zhang... and call Little Sister back from school! Alright. Tell Master Zhang to bring his medical kit. I will! Can he be saved? Let's try! Easy! Give me the glove from the kit. You can't let him die. No, not him, of all people! Brother! What's wrong? Sister-in-law, what's wrong with him? He was fine, how did this happen? You're together every day, you should know. Little Sister! My brother won't die, will he? No, he'll be alright. Brother! Young Mistress? Young Miss? Young Master Zhang? Brother! Brother! Liyan, we're all here. What happened? Why... why did you do that? I... I just thought... Brother Zhang is leaving soon. Liyan asked him to find you a university in Shanghai. I don't want to go. Wait till the summer holidays and see. No! Are you... having an affair with Brother Zhang? No need to see me off beyond the wall. You should go back. No. Brother said I had to see you to the station. It's not necessary. Do as I say. I'll follow my brother's orders Make sure you don't upset him It's not me who upsets him. Brother Zhang, will he get better? Yes, of course he will. You... How come you didn't see off Zhichen? What a mess. Whatever happened, you should've seen him off. Because he said not to doesn't mean you shouldn't. Don't wear yourself out.
