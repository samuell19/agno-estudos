"Fukra." 'In a life, there are many stages of Love.' 'There are "mainly" three which are universally accepted.' "Here he comes. Here he comes, Fukra." 'This is the stage in which a boy can do anything for the girl.' 'Means he finds it to be respectable' 'even if he has to wear a dog collar around his neck.' 'Girl's wish is his command.' "He can just go and hire." "He is so smart. Check his hired shoes." "He is a liar but looks true. Fukra." Drink. Baby, you follow me on your old scooter. Do you know how much repo I have in the colony? Why don't you buy a new motorcycle? Even our Siri got himself a new Pulsar (Bike). "Fukra..." He was our Siri. Oh, God. Do you have a sack full of sand at home? Probably yes. Why? Okay. Punch a hole in it. Before the sand finishes your boyfriend would have a Bullet. Really? - Cheers. - Cheers. "Look, Look he is here." 'The boy is ready to sell kidney for fulfilling the wish of the girl.' 'Because the heart explains that I will survive with one kidney.' 'But I cannot survive without this girl.' 'The second stage of love is that of newlywed couple.' 'At this stage the boy does not follow the girl but walks with her.' 'The happiness that the boy gets after marrying the girl he loved' 'is much more than Sikander's happiness after capturing the whole world.' "Want something like this. Want car like this." Baby, shouldn't we replace this old car with new Thar (Jeep). We don't have parking space for bigger car, dear. If I can manage to live in your small heart, Thar will fit somewhere too. Have faith in God. Take out your phone. Take out your phone and book the car right away. 'There is a little difference between this stage and the first one.' 'In this stage the boy does not think from heart but also from the brain.' What are you doing now? I am checking the EMI. Your God is not going to give that. Aren't you overthinking? God blessed you as I came in your life. Have faith. I don't have faith on God anymore. 'Next comes the third stage of love.' 'The example of third stage of love is Gurmel.' 'The one who is walking 50 meters behind him is his wife Beant.' 'By just looking them, anyone can guess' 'that they have been married for 6-7 years.' 'Gurmel and Beant did not have' 'so much distance between them in the beginning of their marriage.' 'It took time for this distance to happen between them.' 'When they just got married Beant would whole heartedly' 'love Gurmel and spend most of the time with him.' Beant, come here. Yes, what do you need? Sundi has come in our life. 'Every moment of Beant was now for the child.' 'Gurmel is waiting for Beant to come to him after putting the child to bed.' Have patience. He'll fall asleep soon. All I get is patience nowadays. Listen, get up. - Has he slept? - No, he hasn't. My back is hurting. You take care of him now. I can't handle him. Go to sleep, son. Are you scared that if you have a brother then there will be division of land. You alone will get all of my property, I swear. 'Even after 5 years Gurmel is still waiting' 'for kid to falls asleep so that he gets alone time with Beant.' Go to sleep, dear. You have to go to school tomorrow. There is Corona wave going on so I won't go. Okay, but at least go to sleep. Dad, let me play the game. I am going to sleep. You manage. 'There is nothing left to see.' Beant, Beant... Let me sleep, dad. I have to go to school tomorrow. First you said there is corona. You don't have a stand. Beant, Beant... What do you want from her in the middle of the night, dad? I had itch on my back. One day I am going to heal it once for all. Greedy for land. He did not even let the parrots be together. Sundi... Wait, I am being left behind. I wish you "left" me permanently. - What did you say? - Nothing. Keep your face covered. There are so many people around. You move around the city like this. Come on. - Oh, God. - You banged against the car. - We still have to go further. - Sundi, are you fine? Mother and son are lying here out of tiredness. Come on. 'Unknowingly Beant ignored Gurmel so badly' 'that after 6 years of marriage' 'Gurmel's feelings of Romance and Love have completely died.' "We were happy 24 hours." "And our life was easy." "We used to tell everyone how to be happy and enjoy." "We were happy 24 hours." "And our life was easy." "We used to tell everyone how to be happy and enjoy." "An evil eye fell on our happiness..." "To hell with you." "By getting married I invited unnecessary tension, friends." "By getting married I invited unnecessary tension, friends." "We have lost peace of mind at our expense." "Out of pride." "Do not get married boys out of pride." "Do not get married boys and then you will have sad face." "Do not get married boys..." "I had never worn a watch on my wrist."

"The meaning of marriage has been found." "And that is that water and fire can never be together." "And that is that water and fire can never be together." "Rest is your wish. I have told you my feelings." "Whatever you are saying is right." "By getting married I invited unnecessary tension, friends." "By getting married I invited unnecessary tension, friends." "It cheats you..." "It cheats you..." "The so called sweetness of marriage." "Marriage just seems to be sweet on the face of it." "Marriage just seems to be sweet on the face of it." "My lover is like a butterfly." "My lover is like a butterfly." Greetings, sir. - Greetings. - Is my work done? No. - I have been here countless times. - So? It seems as if you are purposely calling me here again and again. It is just a matter of 2 minutes. You just have to get signatures done. And that too sir has to do it. Do you think I am lying? Look at this. Your file is on the top. Sir is busy as it is his 25th anniversary. As soon as he gets free tomorrow I will get your file signed. Okay. - Listen to me. - Yes. Sit. Sir is inside and has come to invite SDM sir. You too should go and congratulate. And he will remember you. Will he remember me if I go and congratulate? Give him a packet (Bribe money) as well as gift. Yes. A packet of groundnuts? You can give of groundnuts if you wish then you can wait for another six months... and keep coming. Yes. I understood. Thank you. Thank you. We shall meet in the party today tonight. Yes, of course. Okay. - Greetings. - Greetings. Congratulations on your 25th Anniversary. I haven't recognized you. Who are you? I am Gurmel. Gurmel who? The one whose file you haven't signed yet. Yes, sir. - Thank you so much. - Greetings. With God's grace did not even realize, how last 25 years of married life passed happily. Thank you so much. We shall meet soon. Is he really happy after 25 years of marriage? Or he is showing off. Yes. Are you really happy after 25 years of marriage? Don't you feel so? Only thing I felt is the shock. Good bye. - Did you personally go and check? - Yes. You just feel all the world is happier than you. I swear Sema, he was so happy after 25 years, as if he someone told him that he could get a new wife in return of the old one. - Is it so? - Yes. They are rich people. They do not even return the old one. And get a new one as well. I am in trouble after 6 years of marriage. It seems as if I took a decision in haste. And now have to live with it all my life. A person can sell old clothes and get new utensils. But will get nothing for them. Its all about one's luck. But it is said that women bring good luck. - For us they brought bad luck. - Oh, God. Which village does Tehsildaar belong to? He is not from a village but is from city Chandigarh. That is the reason. I saw in the mobile. How they keep their wives happy through internet. How? - This is a mall. - Okay. All the immoral relations start from here. - Is it? - Yes. You just look carefully what happens in the city. And how married men stay happy. - Yes. - Look there. That man is holding hands of his wife but is looking at someone else. Doesn't the wife notice? These men show so much love that the wife can't even imagine that her husband is cheating on her. All right then... Only God knows what will happen to this world. Just keep watching and you will be astonished. Look there. Look there. He is giving flying kiss. Shall we go that side? Oh, God... Doesn't he feel ashamed? That's how their relationships are saved. They've all the fun outside the house and once in the house, they just concentrate on keeping the wives happy. And we are worried about petty issues. People are so lucky to be surrounded by so much beauty. That is why this is called a mall (Beautiful). There is so much beauty here. One should just know how to capture the beautiful birds. Government has done a very good job. First they just made bridges and people used to go on bridges and fall. Only thing we need is malls just like this one. After 5-7 years of marriage, just like a dead battery. There is nothing wrong. You just have to charge it by an external wire. And then you can run the motor. Sema, Gurmel Singh Gela will go further than a battery and become a solar system. Come on. How are you, mom? I am fine dear. Here you are. Yes, yes... Write here. Sundi, ask your mother to be ready tomorrow. I will take her to the mall in the city. Mom, did you hear that? He is taking me to a mall tomorrow. He doesn't say it but loves you a lot. Today, we are going to announce the winners. What are you doing? Whatever I am doing is to make you happy. - I know it. - You do not know anything. - One minute. - Okay. You go and see that. Wow. Sundi, look at those rocking chairs. Hello, yes. Sema, where are you? I have come to the city to get pesticide for the crops. You can kill the insects of the crops later. First let us kill our Lust insects. Come to the mall. I have to show you something. What has he seen now? Tempo... Come on. Are you enjoying the mall, Sundi? Give a round of applause. Oh no, what is he doing? Gurmel, come down. Come down. Have you come? Yes I have, but what are you doing? Have you seen? Come here on the side. Let me first find a girlfriend. What am I going to do alone on the side? Whatever you are doing is wrong. You come here. Come quickly. Really? - Be careful, dear. - You be on line. I will be back soon. - You go and see the mall. - Where are you going? The security is not allowing Sema in. I am going to get him in. Yes, probably because he looks ugly. As if she herself is with Tom Cruise. - Go and get him. - Yes, Sema. Hello. Did it get disconnected? - Yes. - Why did you get sister-in-law, here? Because that's what city people do. They bring their wives with them but look at other women. The men from the city bring their wives because their wives do not allow them to come alone. So they have no other option. You could have come alone and enjoyed. Okay. From tomorrow I will come alone and leave Beant at home. But now looking them from distance is not enough for me. What do you want? I want to make a friend with whom I can talk my heart out. - And love her. - Stay away. I asked you to get battery charged from outside. And you want to get other's batteries. Women in city are very smart. If they reach your house the Beant would thrash you. She wouldn't thrash me. She is very simple. We keep a third spare wheel on scooter, although it needs only two to run. In case if one gets flat. Sister-in-law does not get flat. You cannot predict a good or a bad time. We should be ready with an option. Nowadays there are dual sim mobiles as well. If one does not work then talk from the other one. Have you seen yourself in the mirror? A city girl would not even keep a driver like you. And you want to be a friend. Rascal, do you have any stand or not? Yesterday, you were saying that times have changed and today you are shattering my courage, idiot. How will you get close to any girl? We do not even know how to address a girl by saying excuse me. Sema, is he the same man who was with his wife yesterday and was wooing other girls. He is the same. He seems to have complete control on the mall. Miss Afsana has sung a song for people like him. Sometimes on this flower and sometimes on the other... "Yaar Mera Titliyan Warga" (my lover is like a butterfly). Lets do one thing. We'll keep a watch on him and learn how he impresses the girls. We'll follow his every move. - He is going out. - Let's go then. What about Beant? I need to thank her saying that the time we spend together was good. Now the time has come to put the stepney. - Come on. - Looks like Beant's time is over. He wants to put stepney. Keep the veil inside. Take this and drop them carefully. But suddenly what happened? Tell me. Our scooter does not have a stepney so I am going to get that. Okay, get it. Sometimes the scooter does get punctured. That is why I am trying to arrange one. Go. Okay. He is leaving. Let's follow him. Okay, then. Bye. I will leave now. - Take care. - Bye. What time will you be back? I have a meeting in office so will be a little late. - Okay, no problem. - Okay. - Sonu. - Yes? - He is leaving. - Come on. - Hi. - Hello. - Come, please. - Thank you. - Is she the same one? - Yes. To whom he was giving signals. She is whitish like milk. Hurry up. Come on. Greetings. - Greetings. - Greetings. Why did the boy take the girl inside? If we started telling it, we'll go out of business. Can we go inside and see a bit? You don't seem bitty type. - We want to drink tea. - Yes. The cost of tea is 250 rupees inside. There is a fresh fruit juice stall there. You get a glass of fresh fruit for 40 rupees. Go. Wouldn't there be crowd here if anything was visible? Sema, he took her inside. And his wife thinks that her husband is at work. And he is enjoying. Did you get a fit while writing our destiny? Don't curse God. Otherwise, he might take back the little He has given you. Take back if you want. What will you have, brother? At this moment, all I have is patience. - We'll call you back for order. - Okay. You will not be able to do such things. The hotel staff will stop you at the gate. They will send the girl inside and you'll again be left outside. Once I have a girlfriend, I would cross the Wagah (Pakistan) border for her. Entering the hotel won't be a problem whatsoever. There is a big problem. These girls become friends only with handsome boys. Out of pity someone may shake hands with you. Rest seems difficult for you. Nothing is difficult, Sema. Let them come out. Then I am going to fall at his feet and make him may master. And I am going to learn and grasp all his knowledge. - Listen to me. Listen to me. - Why did you come here? You lied to me so that you could enjoy with her? What are you doing with her? Do you think you will be happy after creating problems in my family? I'll show you. - Listen to me. - What should I listen to you? Leave me. What are you doing? - What were you doing? - We came here for lunch. - Let me feed you Dosa, you bitch. - Leave me. - What are you doing, Dear? - Call her dear not me. Why did you bring her here? You lied to me. - We had come here for lunch. - What are you doing? - Listen to me. - Tell. - We had come here for lunch. - I will teach you... Let me see how you come home, rascal. Ultimately, you'll have to come back to me. What are you looking at, brother? This happens every day. Every day 5-6 husbands are thrashed. But the husbands are so stubborn that they still do not stop. Yes. It depends on the wife. If your wife is good then she can explain nicely. A wife may be simple and innocent but after seeing such acts even she would get wild. In this life you adjust with Beant. Who knows what will God make us in the next birth? Let's put in extra effort in this life. So, you are ready to get thrashed. If nobody succeeded, no one would even try. You used to say that person with extramarital affair always keep his wife happy. You mean to say that I can never be happy in marriage. There must be some way out. - Yes, there is. - What? Have you heard about Facebook? Yes, where boys and girls dance. - Even old people are on it now. - Really? They have reignited their old affairs through it. Okay. This is the easiest way to find a girlfriend. Do you have 4,000 rupees? Yes, but I have to pay the bill. You can pay the bill later, first let me buy you a mobile. Yes, come. Here it is, with the cover. - This is great. Give him the money. - Yes. - Okay, thank you. - Okay, bye. I've no money left. You cannot enjoy without spending. You'll feel like that you are in a carnival. Really? Gurmel, your Facebook account has been opened. Whose photo should I put? You made me spend 4,000 rupees then it is obvious you will put my photo and not that of neighbors. Look at yourself. Forget girls, even boys won't accept your friend request. No one puts their own photo to do wrong things. - Then? - You can get trapped as well. We shall put photograph of a handsome boy. While his photo will attract girls. You'll remain safe. Hey, you. Don't stand against my car. You dirty people. Get lost. He insulted us. Of course, he will. He has such an expensive car. He has the right. What is its price? He made us... - Fool? - No, next level of fool. Two glasses of juice. Bring two glasses of juice for Young men. Anything else? You have made a very nice body. He also wants to make his body like this. Shall I click a photograph as sample? Yes, you can. Not just one but you can click 5-6. One minute. I haven't worn my goggles. Wear it. "Sexy, sexy... yeah." "Sexy, sexy... yeah." I have clicked. You may go. "Sexy, sexy..." Take it. I have put his photo and named you as Soorma. Enjoy as much as you want. If there is any problem, then he would land in trouble. "Yeah!" "Yeah..." "Baby, come to me." "Baby, come to me." "Check, check me out." "Check, check me out." "Check, check me out." Sema, have some sweet. I will never be able to return your favor. I am so happy. Why is he distributing sweets? Nothing big. He has bought spare type for his scooter. That's why he is so happy. Only poor people know how to be happy even in small moments. Rich people are always in tension even after buying an airplane. "The boy is trying to woo with bottle in his hand." "He is roaming aimlessly to achieve something." "The boy is trying to woo with bottle in his hand." "He is roaming aimlessly to achieve something." "The heart of jatt is out of his control..." "From the time he has seen you Billo..." "From the time he has seen you Billo..." "From the time he has seen you Billo..." "You are the medicine for my headache which doctors give." "Your loving looks makes me intoxicated." "Your sweet voice makes me intoxicated." "Your sweet voice makes me intoxicated." "Your fragrance is hot, Billo." "I feel the entire world is cheating." "I am not able to sleep all night." "From the time he has seen you Billo..." "From the time he has seen you Billo..." "From the time he has seen you Billo..." This is for you. Really? Mom, he has brought it for me. It is so beautiful. Didn't I tell you that he loves you a lot? Here. Keep them. "In what way can I praise you, dear?" "Stars fall on ground on seeing you." "Your innocence will create havoc." "Your innocence will create havoc." "I blow sweet breeze into the air..." "I wouldn't spare those who stop your way." "I would kill someone for you." "From the time he has seen you Billo..." "From the time he has seen you Billo..." "From the time he has seen you Billo..." You are bit too busy in the Phone today. I was just doing some calculations. - Oh, okay. - Yes. Mom, recite a poem for me. Keep quiet and go to sleep, dear. Your father may miscalculate something. - Here you are Chindo. - Yes. - How are you? - I am fine. Come and sit. - Greetings, aunty. - Live a long life. Take this sweetmeat. For this marriage, you were away for long. It was my brother's wedding so I fulfilled all my wishes. Why didn't Gurmel go to fields today? He did. He has just come back from there. Tell me about your new sister-in-law. She is very beautiful. Just like you. Sundi, let's go to Gurudwara Sahib. (Sikh Temple) They'll visit us soon. Whenever they do, let me know. I'll invite them for Lunch/Dinner. You wait here and I will go and make tea. Have tea. What is Gurmel doing on the phone? He is calculating the account he has got with Loan Shark. While doing calculations most of the people sweat in tension. He seems to be very happy. He says this time Loan Shark owes us money. That is why he is happy. You do not have 100 acres of land, you just have 4 acres... Have you checked yourself, weather he is really doing it? What do you mean? The way he is happy hooked on the phone I think, he is chatting with a girlfriend. These phones have destroyed many homes. How? My aunt's daughter's husband had a girlfriend and he was always on the phone. Just like you the family felt that he must be doing calculations. Later everyone came to know that he was having an affair with a girl. Her family was totally destroyed. But I don't think he is of this sort. Those who do not appear are more flirtatious. Is he bringing you gifts more than usual. Yes, he is giving me many gifts from last few weeks. Earrings, Lipsticks and nail polish etc. All these are signs of a player. Just go near him when he is on the phone. And do not move from there. If he doesn't hide his phone than he is not lying. But if he does, than there is definitely something wrong, Beant. Yes. Tea. Go. What did your friend say? Nothing much. She is telling me about all that happened at her brother's wedding. - Go and listen. - Yes. Where are you at with the accounting? - It is little complicated. - What is the complication? There is some confusion about 2-3 entries. Tell me. Even I can clear the confusion. I will tell you. Okay. Go, go. Beant what happened. He hid his mobile, Chindo. My family is doomed. Don't cry Beant. These men are like dogs with two legs. - Since when is it going on? - With two legs? No, all this? Its going on for a while. I saw it on the phone. How Innocent women like us make mistakes after having the kids that makes a man loses interest. 'I am going to sleep. You manage.' 'There is nothing left to see.' Yes, I have made mistakes. It is not too late. You can still fix it. Mom, can Sundi sleep with you tonight? Gurmail have cough, I don't want Sundi to get infected. - Put him here, dear. - Mom, I don't want to sleep here. Please sleep here, otherwise you will fall sick. Come, my dear. Come. Come. Why are you making so much noise? Go to sleep. You disturbed mine as well. Dropping utensils at middle of the night. Mom, I want to sleep here. Come dear, I was coming to get you. Do you know what it means when you are interested and he shows no interest? - That he has taken a vow. - Stupid. This means that he is already satisfied. He is looking for someone new. The way he is moving on I feel he is not going to spare any girl. I will clear it out with him today. Will he accept that he is doing all this? He is a man after all. Even if you catch him red handed, he would say that he caught her because he felt it was you. If you want to teach him a lesson then do what he is doing? What do you mean? Make friends on mobile phone. What rubbish suggestions are you giving? Do you want to set things right or not? He will realize his mistake when he sees you glued to the phone. Only tit for tat can make them understand how we feel. Believe me that he will learn a lesson. I think to set him right I am going to be in a mess. No Chindo, I will be disgraced. It is better to be disgraced than to be finished. You are not doing anything wrong, Beant. You are not going to hug people. You just have to make friends on Facebook, Tinder. Give me some time to think. Till you think, he will leave no woman. If you want to set him right then you will have to pick up one thing. Either a stick or a mobile. Not a stick for sure. How is this one? - This? - This looks all right. How much is this for, brother? This would cost you 4,000 rupees. Okay, fine. Pack this one. - Okay. - Give him the money, Beant. Hello, brother. Will I get new sim on British Passport (Foreign Document)? Don't you have proof of local relatives? Actually I still have to meet local relatives. I haven't met them. Count them. It is 4,000 rupees. - Okay. - Come, let's go. Look, the thing is... How could she? What kind of language was she speaking? I think she is from a foreign land... maybe England. Listen to me, Beant. Shouldn't we make your fake account on Facebook? What do you mean by fake? It means, we will put photograph and name of someone else. And in future there will be no questions raised on your dignity. We are not going to make real friends. Just to tease him. Wait, I will do something. How can you put anyone's photo? Do not bring disgrace to anyone's name. We will put up photograph of a foreigner. No one will know nor will be disgraced. Does the name Mini suit the photograph? Whatever you think is right. Hold this. I am there with you Beant if anything goes wrong. Come on, let's go. Walk fast. If you need bread, take it from the box. I've to do something important on my phone. Okay. If you want more vegetables then take it yourself. I am busy with my phone. Okay... Okay, you have bought a new phone. - You are trying to copy me... - Think it that way. I had some money saved so I bought it. Will you remain busy in phone or get me a glass of water. I am busy but still I will get it for you. So gorgeous. If she becomes my friend then... "Baby, baby..." Take it. "Come on. Come on, baby." "Come on. Come on, baby." "Baby, baby..." "Baby, baby..." Beant, you are so lucky. You have received not 1 or 2 but 20 friend requests. - Then? - What kind of immoral specie are men? The moment they see a beautiful girl, they start wooing. Yesterday, I teased him by saying that I am busy with phone like you but it did not affect him. Just think Beant that the person is not bothered that what is his wife doing on the phone. Then imagine how engrossed he must be in the phone. You continue to do your job, Beant. Sema... Sema... Sema... Sema... What happened? - Open the door. - What happened? The one to whom I had sent friend request has accepted it. Listen! What happened? Nothing, Gurmail has gotten new rubber on spare tyre. Truly only people like us enjoy small moments. - Look. - Oh, wow! She must be blind. But she has seen photograph of Soorma. Tell me, how should I move ahead? What do we know? We never talk. Straight away we give birth to a child. How can I give birth to a child on phone? Okay, then write. Thank you for having pity on me, sister. I have to write from my side and not from your side. - Cut out, sister. - Yes. Thank you for being my friend. Look at this. It's done. Where is she going in such a hurry? She must have gone to Chindo's house. She often goes there. You come with me. What has happened now? That boy has sent me a message. Thank you for being friends. What is wrong in this? Isn't it wrong that I am talking to a stranger? I can just act to tease Gurmail. You are not a good actor. You'll easily get caught. Gurmel is not going to straighten up till he does not sense that you are cheating on him. Cheating? I am scared of the words that you are using. You are not a cheater. How do I explain it to you? To kill someone on the road and on the border are both murders. For first murder you get punishment and for the other one you are praised. - You will be praised. - For such work? - Are your intentions clear? - Yes. Then, what are you scared of? They think we have brought wives at home and now we can do anything anywhere. - They can do that at home. - But still they enjoy outside. Now tell me what do I have to do? Initiate friendship with those boys who talk respectfully with you. Be busy with him as much as possible. This time do not let him go anywhere. Or else we will not spare him. I will be as free as he is. Thank you for being my friend. "Fall in love without worrying about the caste." "Do not bother about day or night." "Just look at his love and not his status."

I love you. How are you? Did you have your food? Dad, give me phone. Dear, dad is doing some important work on the phone. Mom, you give me. No, dear. Mom is receiving some very important messages. You do not care for me but at least give me the phone. What did you say, Sundi? Where did he go? 'Atleast you say something.' 'What happened, Mini? Are you annoyed with your Soorma?' 'Answer me. I am worried.' 'Have you slept, my dear? I miss you.' "I miss you." "Baby, baby..." "Baby, baby..." "Baby, baby..." 'Good morning to my dear from Soorma.' 'You seem to be very romantic this early in the morning, Soorma.' 'I get intoxicated seeing your photographs.' 'Really? Anything else.' 'Tell me, what are you doing?' 'I had come to pluck apples from the garden of my house.' 'Wow! That is great.' 'Mini, will you give me your number?' 'No Soorma, I cannot give my number.' 'It is my request to you.' 'You will not lose anything but it will make me happy.' 'Sometimes think about others as well. God will bless you.' "Baby, baby..." Sema, Mini refused to give me her phone number. I don't understand why do you want her number? At least I have to check that she is not dumb. Then, will you leave her? Actually, I feel like listening to her voice. I am not satisfied chatting on the phone. You will land in trouble, Gurmel. We had put someone else's photo on Facebook so that you don't get trapped. And now you want to talk on the phone. I am sure you will talk cheap. - Yes. - You fool. If someone records your voice then Punjabi people's bad news also trends very high. No, I shall not get caught. Did you listen to the voice of that Haryanvi boy? He spoke so well. Now what is happening to you? Haven't you understood yet? No, nothing has torn. I mean to say that haven't you understood anything? We will speak in the voice of the one whose photograph we have put. You just have to tell me how to get number of that girl. People learn English to impress girls and you are learning Haryanvi. I was suggesting that let us bribe the Facebook owner with bottle. He would help us get the number of Mini. Do you know who runs Facebook? But you can make a call through Facebook. - Really? - I know everything. - What are you saying... - Give me the phone. Here. - The bell is ringing. - Wow! That is great. You did the same thing. 'Hello Mini, it's me Soorma.' 'Hello Mini, say something.' 'I want to hear your voice.' 'Hello, hello Mini. Where have you gone?' Why aren't you speaking? Don't interfere. 'Mini, it's me.' 'Your Soorma.' - Hello. - Mom... Say something. Mini. If Gurmail finds out, I'll be doomed. I just can't understand. She had received the call but did not speak. Is she really dumb? I think she did not like Harnayavi language. Let's try something else. I don't think such a beautiful girl will like a Bihari. Where is Beant going in a hurry? Just like a three wheeler passes through the traffic. Where will the poor girl go at this age? She must be going to her friend's house. Good that she is busy with her friends and this will keep you safe. Do one thing. Make a call. Not to me but call your mother. - To my mom? - Not to her but to Facebook girl. - Okay. Come on. - Let's go. She did not receive the call. Chindo, my family life will be finished. Somehow he has gotten my phone number. How did he get it? I am sure you must have given him yourself, to have fun. I swear I haven't. I am not like that. Now he'll find my house as well. And then Gurmel and the entire village will come to know about it. That is why I had put someone else's photo. One minute, Beant. But you have not received anyone's call. I have received two calls. And you are saying that I have received not even one. What are you doing Mini? Why aren't you saying anything? He had called you on Facebook. He does not have your number. Look, he is calling again. This is called Facebook messenger call. But still a call is coming. Do me a favor. Close all my accounts. Did Gurmel delete all accounts? Of course, he is a man. So what if he keeps few women on the side. If in future he woos me then I will trap him too. Chindo. 'It is my request to please receive my call.' 'I am really not feeling good.' 'I consider you as my best friend.' Even Gurmel must be sending sweet messages to girls. Like these? Soorma still seems to be better. A person like Gurmel would be sending cheap ones. There is no harm in hugging few men to teach a lesson to him. Do not step back. Are you trying to save my family or turning me into cheap Gurmel? Every time you make me take one step further. Gurmel is not bothered about the friends that you have made. It is important that he gets bothered. I know it is very difficult for a good woman to do this. I would have also done the same thing if I was in your place. - Now should I pick up the call as well? - Yes. We have put someone else's photo so that I am not recognized. Wouldn't anyone recognize my voice? Are you so popular? But for your safety talk in a way as this girl looks. Do you remember the girl we had met in the mobile shop? 'Hello brother. Can I get a new sim on British passport (Foreign document)?' You remember that? Hello. Hello, Mini. How are you? I am fine. What about you? I am fine too. Why didn't you talk in the Morning? I couldn't hear you. But I could hear you. I could hear the motor and other sound as well. Were you in the kitchen? Kitchen... no, no kitchen. I was flying the plane and its motor sound you heard. Oh no... she is a pilot. She is a pilot. Thank me. Okay, so you are a pilot, Mini. The one who flies the plane. No, no... we have our own planes. I had gone to buy vegetables. Oh no, she has her own plane. God is great. You do not even have a tractor. Yes, yes. - Yes, Mini. - What do you do? I stand on the ground and wave good bye to planes. Mini, I wanted to ask you something. You speak in a different way. I have come from foreign land... Okay. One minute. I will have to disconnect the call. I will talk to you later. Sema, I'll go mad with exitement. Leave me. If she finds out about you, she'll definitely go mad. Let her go mad. Beant, you? How come you are here? I had gone to Chindo's house. Do you need anything? No, I don't need anything. Okay bye. 'I am sad about the fact that you don't need anything from me.' "Sometimes on this flower and sometimes on that flower..." Serve food to me. Okay. "Your lover is like a butterfly." Disconnected it. Hello. What happened, Mini? You sound sad. No, I am not sad. If there is any problem then tell me, dear. My husband... Husband? Are you married? - Yes. - Understood. Your husband must be wife beater. No, he neither beats me nor says anything to me. Then what is the problem? No, leave it. He might come here any moment. - I am disconnecting the call. - 'Hello, Mini.' At least you should have told me what the matter is. This is wrong. She is married. Her husband's... - Good that you both are married. - What do you mean? She is a married woman so she won't tell anybody about the affair. She seemed disturbed because of her husband. That rascal must be woman beater. Probably pulls her down from flying plain by pulling her plait. I have realized one thing. Whether a person is educated or uneducated the life of a woman is a mess. No. He does not beat her. Maybe he has an extra marital affair. I have realized one thing. A person may live in a city or village he is always interested in other women. She almost told me. That her husband and stopped suddenly. He does not beat her nor says anything to her. Maybe he is handicapped. - No, no... - Try to understand. Her husband is a defaulter. She needs true love. - Shall I give her? - Where do you have true love in you? You are cheating on your wife. I just want to meet Mini. Have you gone mad? You have put someone else's photo. Wouldn't she scream looking at you? - She won't. - Are you Salman Khan? You have no idea, Sema. The way she was talking to me seemed that she has moved quite ahead. She has fallen in love with me. It is important that we meet. He is moving quite ahead. Don't go to meet him. As if I would go. You never know when the man loses his control. Remember one thing. We have to bring Gurmel on line and not spoil your alignment. As it is he wants to meet Mini in the photo. You are as beautiful as she is. Even I wouldn't let you do anything wrong. Next time he calls, plainly refuse to meet him. "Do something amazing that I become yours." "As of now I am Beant's and want to become Mini's." Beant, are you here? Beant. Yes, tell me. Just sprinkle the rose water on my face. "I want to be of someone else." "This is wrong what you are doing Gurmel." "I want" "to move ahead with my plan." 'Tell me Soorma, where and when do you want to meet?' 'Tell me Soorma, where and when do you want to meet? - Hello. - Sema, I am meeting Mini tomorrow. Really? Yes. I've many spare rose water bottles. - Shall I drink one? - Why? In case I fart accidentally, it'll smell good. To hell with you. Are you going to meet her or make her smell the fart? Disconnect the call. Rascal, made me smell it. "I have recently fallen in love." "The Jatt has recently become young." "I have recently fallen in love." - "The Jatt has recently become young." - Sema. What has happened now, rascal? Look at Gurmel for the last time. Are you going to die? Henceforth, you will see Gela. Proper beard and nice clothes. No more scooter but only Bullet... Where did you learn these two words of English? Girls have taught Jatt English on Facebook. Before meeting Mini someone had written on Facebook openly... What? Phus you. (I like you). Not Phus you. She cursed you in english... let's go. That is a bad word in English. "She knows what is there in my heart. She is just like my friend." "With whom the young man has fallen in love." "I have recently fallen in love." "The Jatt has recently become young." "I have recently fallen in love." "The Jatt has recently become young." - Where is he? - He would make you gentleman. - He? - Yes. His own hair are not cut properly... To me he seems to be a... - Fool. - More than a fool. "She has chain of my love in her neck." "Not just that but it is just like sign of love." "She has chain of my love in her neck." "Not just that but it is just like sign of love." "She is crazy about the Jatt." "She comes in my dreams whenever she feels like." "I swear on God that she is very cute." "I have recently fallen in love." "The Jatt has recently become young." "I have recently fallen in love." "The Jatt has recently become young." Who are you, brother? Mom, he looks just like dad. I don't look like your dad, I am your dad. "I have recently fallen in love." "The Jatt has recently become young." "I have recently fallen in love." "The Jatt has recently become young." Chindo. - What now? - I am totally finished Chindo. He is behaving like Gippy Grewal. "I do not know buddy where does she belong to." "I have got used to her just like sweetened tea." "I do not know buddy where does she belong to." "I have got used to her just like sweetened tea." "Just like winter she is of sweet nature." "We have just met but I still feel as if she has studied with me." "I have recently fallen in love." "The Jatt has recently become young." 'Hello, Mini. Are we surely meeting at 12 noon tomorrow?' 'Yes, Soorma. Confirm at 12 noon.' What happened? Nothing. It Just happened. Dad, you almost made me piss in my pants. I don't know what happens to you in the middle of the night. Uncle. So early... - Hello. - I am your uncle speaking. Your aunt is no more. Is it? Has aunt got her knees operated? Congratulations to you, uncle. Stupid, I mean to say she is dead. What? When? Early morning at 3. She will be cremated at 12 noon. I will pick you up on the way. 12 noon... Uncle, I did not have such good relations with aunt. You should go. What are you saying? She missed you a lot during her last time. And you are saying that you did not get along well with her. Be ready at 8 in the morning. At 8? Hello. What happened? That... Aunt died. Oh, God! Uncle, you unnecessarily dragged me into this. I don't like going to cremation ground. No one likes to go there? Come on get in. Let the women get in first. Let's go. There was nothing to be worried about. She was perfectly fine. Gurmail, your aunt left us. Why did aunt had to die today? What? Aunt passed away. She was too young to die? - What was her age? - 73 years. Is 73 an age to die? Come. Uncle... Sit down properly. Yes... Uncle, grab her. Shall we pick up aunt? The cremation time is 12 and it is only 10:30. Corona is everywhere, uncle. It doesn't look good that there are so many people here. Her daughter is yet to arrive. Will she bring her back to life? We'll still have to burn her anyway. Why are you wasting time? You seem to be in a hurry. Can't you sit quietly? Aunt's body has started to stink. We should perform the last rites. Don't talk nonsense. She is my sister. Then don't burn her body. Preserve it in the refrigerator. Keep knocking the door and asking how you are sister. Bring her out the day she speaks. Yes. Call up the sister and find out where she is? Mom... The aunt has come so lift the girl. The girls has come so lift the aunt. Let us lift her. - Uncle, grab her. - What? Pick her up. Let the girl meet her. Mom... If she falls, there will be many casualties here. Mom... Enough, keep quiet. Sister, we were waiting for you. Let's go. Come on, pick her up. Pick her up. Pick her up. No! Slowly, dear. Gurmel, why are you running? The body will fall. But she is not going to get hurt. - We will pick her up and put back. - Slowly. The government has announced a lock down again. And has asked people to perform the last rites of people who have died. - Mom... - Enough, sister. - Enough. - Take me also with you... - Uncle, how far is the cremation ground. - There is still fair distance left. Didn't I suggest you to buy a house near cremation ground? But you did not listen to me. We would have to walk less today. 'Mini, I have got stuck in some work. Can we meet at 3 instead of 12?' You should have taken me along with you. - Mom... - Okay, fine. Mom... Oh, God! Why are you running? Gurmel... I am missing aunt's laughter. Why did aunt leave us? I can't understand whether I should cry or be happy? What are you doing? Mom... - Mom... - Enough, dear... enough. - Take me also with you. Take me. - Why doesn't he light the pyre? No, mom... Light the pyre and take the rounds. Do it now. Otherwise, the fire may get blown off. Put it. Mom... - Mom... - Come on, let's go. Or do you want to accompany her to heaven? Come on all those people who were with me in the tempo. - Come on, hurry up. - Why is he in hurry? Wait. - She was my sister. - Come on. - Come, uncle. - Yes. Why have you all become hard hearted? Let me cry. - Oh, my God... - Hurry up, get in. Come on. Hurry up. Don't be slow. Hurry up. Get in. Bye, aunt. Love you. Dad, I want to eat ice cream. Who eats ice cream in winter? Then let me have juice. What will you do after drinking juice? He will urinate. You can use that to make 'Jal Jeera' (A Drink). You always cross question the child. Listen to what your child says. Come, dear. Come on. "Sexy, sexy..." "Sexy, sexy..." - Brother, which juice will you drink? - Tell him, dear. - Orange juice. - Get 3 orange juice. Make orange juice for the child. We shall make in one minute. Get down, get down... hurry up. Come on... Uncle, since we have come from cremation so that is why I cannot invite you home so what I was saying... Enough, dear. You seem to be very busy today. Because of you I have cremated my sister in such a way as if someone had destroyed the proof of a murder. - Okay, uncle. - Enough. Leave it. Let's go. It is said that you should take a bath after coming back from cremation. - Dad, straighten me at least. - Okay. - Go. - Come, dear. Oh no, it is 2o'clock. - Where are you going? - We have come from cremation so we should also take a shower. Sure, have a proper bath. Where are you meeting her today? At Bestech Mall. And then we will decide where to go from there. Take care of yourself. Keep a watch on Beant. It seemed as if she had doubt on me today. Do you remember the incident that took place in Mohali? Oh, yes. She is from the village so will thrash with elbows. No, she isn't going to go anywhere today. Just keep a watch that she does not board the bus to come to the city. - Okay. You do one thing. - Yes. You meet Minni and I'll keep an eye on Beant. 'Mini, I will reach mall at 3:15.' -'You too reach on time.' -Okay. Okay.
