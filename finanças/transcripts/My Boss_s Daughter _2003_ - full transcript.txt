You know, you ever heard that old expression... "Everything happens for a reason?" I don't think that applies to me. I spend every morning rushing to catch the subway... to the same lousy job. What's the reason for that? I research for one of the biggest publishing houses in Chicago... but where I really belong is in Creative. My boss doesn't know it yet, so I'm totally frustrated... while my friend Paul keeps telling me: "You've gotta be optimistic. You've got to be positive.” Okay! You know what? Today is gonna be my lucky day. Today is gonna be... Hey, look at that. It's your lucky day. - Did you just see that? - A million times. You want it? I don't want it. Go ahead, you got a new briefcase. Maybe it's got a name on it or something. What, are you nuts? What? You're gonna return it? Did you not just say you needed a new one? When I get my raise. Haven't you been working there for like a year? I bet Taylor doesn't know you work there. I'd be pissed. Are you pissed? I'd be pissed. I'm a little pissed. Come to think of it, I've never really seen you angry. Henderson, you ever seen Tom really angry? No. So I don't get angry. What, is that a bad thing? It's, you know, you keep it bottled up... sooner or later you come to work and mow everyone down... - AK-47. - AK-47, just to impress... - Jodie Foster. - Jodie Foster. All right, I'll do it on your day off. Touché. There she is. It's your Jodie Foster. How are you ever gonna get to know her if you just sit there? - Taylor's daughter, I just can't. - Can't just what? Are you gonna be a loser your whole life? Just go over there and talk to her. Go! - Okay, fine. I'm going. - You're going. Excuse me... Hi, I... I... I... he would... What are you doing to my dog? - Who's taunting my dog! - Nobody is taunting your dog. Why don't you take my seat. Here. That's great. Two more minutes and I'll get closer than you. Look, opening. Go! Go! Just go. You're Tom Stansfield, right? From Research? Yeah, Tom. Tom Stansfield... Stansfield from Research. It's a growing sport, you know? There is no way that she thought that it was a wrestling magazine. Come on, get over it, okay? A little embarrassed. It happens. Let me tell you something. If I had a dime for every time a gay magazine fell out of my... I'm kidding. I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You got a little humiliated... At least we've established that she knows who you are. - I have to leave the company. - No, you're not. God! There she is. Are you Tom? - Yes. - Mr. Taylor wants to see you. But... okay... Okay. Okay, you see? This is fate. This is what I'm talking about. That new opening in Creative, you're the man for the job. You're gonna go in there and pitch him those book ideas. - I'm really not ready. - Get to business. We're stepping up. You're gonna go in there, pitch him an inside curve. Wait, where's my blue folder? You don't need it. Enough excuses already. Come here. - You feel good? - I feel like I'm gonna throw up. I want you to use that. It's nice. Now get out of here. - Don't, don't touch my ass. - It was a light spank. - Do I just go on in? - He's not finished yet... but you can have a seat over there. Let me explain something to you, Henderson. I did not dislike your ideas. I found them loathsome! I hated them. - You're dismissed. - From your office? Nice try. Good luck. You're gonna need it. He's ready to see you. You can come in. You know what? We should have never let up after the Revolution! Sit down, sit down. Coffee? I hear about you making threats... to spray this place with an AK-47? What? I was just making a joke. That's funny to you? Killing everyone in this office? No. No. Paul said how I never get angry. And what about you making fun of midgets? I never made fun of midgets. You said it'd be fun to date one, you rest your beer on her head. No, I never said anything like that. Apparently, Henderson thinks you did. I've got a good sense of humor, but that's just plain sick. - But, I didn't say anything... - Audrey! Which file did I ask you for? - The Platt file? - John Platt, not Sam Platt. - I'm sorry. I guess I didn't think... - That's right. You didn't think. Now, if it's not too much trouble... You could fetch me the right file, and get Tom and me some donuts. I'm told you've been trying to schedule a meeting with me... about some ideas. What are they? I had some ideas. Something wrong with the coffee? - No, it's fine. - Why'd you make a face? It's a little bitter. Jesus! Audrey, get in here! - Sir, really, it's fine. - I've burped up better than this. - Is something wrong? - Taste Tom's coffee. It's okay. How would you rate that? - It's not that great. - "Not that great?" guess so. Tom thinks it's shit. Audrey are you retarded? It's not a rhetorical question. Are you retarded? - No, I'm not retarded. - Because... a retarded person can make a cup of coffee. Am I right, Tom? I don't really know much about the limitations of the handicapped. I know of an agency that hires out retarded people for $4/hour. If making a cup of coffee is too difficult for you, Miss Bennett... perhaps you'd be good enough to let me know... and I'll contact this agency and give a retarded person a job. I wasn't too rough on her, was I? - She is new and all. - Maybe I was out of line. But do you understand what I'm dealing with? I am trying to fill a position in Creative... and I can't seem to find one person responsible enough to trust. I sometimes wonder if anyone here even knows what they're doing. I can understand how you could see it that way. So you don't think I was out of line? A company is only as strong... as it's weakest link... - that makes sense, but... - Exactly. A company is only as strong as it's weakest link. Audrey, get in here! You were right, Tom. I was too soft on her. Audrey, after talking it over with Tom here... I've come to realize that I have to let you go. - You're firing me? - I'm sorry. Wait, But, sir, I wasn't suggesting... A chain is only as strong as it’s weakest link. Right, but there's a whole other side to that... Audrey empty out your desk by the end of the day. This has been very helpful. Right, but I didn't get to say what I wanted to say. Your ideas! Schedule an appointment with my new secretary. Tom. Are you okay? Sure. By the way you look, he's on another one of his rampages. - Definitely. - Damn. I was hoping to catch him in a good mood. That's probably not gonna happen. I'm supposed to go to this party tonight but my dad's making me... house sit for his stupid bird while he's away this weekend. Why don't you just go in there and tell him you're not gonna do it? I can't just... You can't just what? Live your own life and have a free weekend? No, it's not that. Wait, it is that. I should just go to that party. Yeah, of course. I'm gonna go back to work. Tom, I know this might seem a little out of place... because we barely even know each other... but do you have any plans tonight? No, I'm wide open. - We won't be home too late. - Hey, it's no problem. So the party starts at seven. Be at my dad's house by six? - Sure you're cool with this? - Are you kidding me? You're a sweetheart. I'm gonna love you forever for this. All right! - Who's the man now? - What'd I tell you? I'm a lady-killer. How the hell could he be so excited about house-sitting? He's nice, Daddy. Most guys wouldn't even offer to do that. I don't know if I want him around my bird. Would you just relax? It's gonna be fine. I promise. I'll check in as soon as I get there. Eight o'clock. If I sense anything's wrong, you're coming back here. Okay. Very good, right on time. Oh, Sir... Is that a bear trap? It's to keep the neighbors' kids out of my yard. Sir... I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate... you letting tonight happen. I know it means a lot to Lisa and you're doing the right thing. I don't know what you're planning, Stansfield but... your attitude is making me very nervous. Those socks are clean, right? You hesitated. Put those on. Are you serious? If you want to watch TV, the remote's there. That panel controls the lights, alarm, skylights... I probably won't use that stuff, since the party starts at seven. Party? I made it clear to Lisa you're not to have guests in here. You're the only one allowed in the house. Lisa's not here? No, of course not. Lisa's at the party... and I'm staying here. Is this concept too complicated for you, Stansfield? Don't touch the furniture. And this is my bird's room. He's got his own room? That's cool. How's my little boy? This is OJ. OJ? - Like the murderer? - No. Like the football player, OJ Simpson. I've set the alarm. When you hear it go off, feed him. - What do I feed these little guys? - They don't get fed. They are the food. His diet varies, but they're his favorites. Don't you have to shut these doors? Not anymore. He's been depressed since his mate died. He won't fly. He just sits in his cage. Medication: Give him two of these at ten o'clock. I have to shove these down his throat? Just one. The other is inserted into his rectum. Don't worry. It's not too unpleasant for him. He doesn't bite, does he? You're not planning on taunting him, are you? - I mean, that would be sick. - No, of course not. And the most important thing: make sure he gets a pint of water. The medication tends to dry him out and then he can't breathe. I must be off. Henderson should be waiting outside. Henderson? I thought you fired him. Because his ideas were stupid? Of course not. He's gonna drive me to the train station. So, you can leave as soon as Lisa and Hans get back. - Hans? - Lisa's boyfriend. So remember: water in the bowl, medication and... anything happens to this house while I'm gone, I'll kill you. You're house-sitting? You gotta be kidding me. - I know. It sucks. - What are you talking about? Don't you see? This is a test. You watch the house come up with great ideas... and if everything goes smooth you get the promotion. - You think so? What could be easier? Book Ideas. You scared me, Hans! Is Jack around? - Who are you? - It's okay. I'm Red Taylor. I'm Jack's son. I let myself in the back. Tom Stansfield. Tom, nice to meet you. Am I interrupting something here? I was... - Your shoes. - Nike. Tom, can you do me a favor? I lost my TV Guide. I came here to see if maybe my dad's got a copy of one. You haven't seen a copy of the Guide laying around? - My sister in? - No, she's out. Bingo. So, you're here to...? House-sit. You don't tell Lisa that I stopped by. Why? Is there a problem? - You know how uptight she is. - Really? I'm more the, free spirit of the family. Oh, boy. See that right there? - Kirstie Alley? - I dated her maid. Really? I've boned Kirstie's maid. That's why they made... "Look Who's Talking." That's something. I'll tell you another thing. You know Michelle Pfeifer? - Yes. - I did the deed with her cousin. - Right there in the bushes. - Right... She looks just like Michelle, except she's brunette, short. Certainly you rest little less than I, Red. - Are you married, Tom? - No, I'm single. - No girlfriend? - No, I had one... but we broke up. Listen... I need to get back to work and you got your TV guide... So you broke up... Too bad. - Was she a looker? - Yes, to me she was. - I bet you still have her picture. - Yes, I do. - Can I see it? - Yes. - There she is. - Wow, Tom... you luck man! She's a piece of ass! I could knock her mad all daylong! She is a pretty girl. - She's got to be wicked in bed... - Yes, sure... She can bang your Johnson raw every single night... Stop, you're talking about my girlfriend. Ex-girlfriend. - Yes but still... - I'm just making conversation. I don't feel comfortable talking about my relationships with a stranger. Understood. You're uptight about sex, you answered the question. I'm not uptight! I don't feel like revealing... my ex girlfriend's sexual habits does not make me uptight. - I'm not asking anything personal. - What do you consider personal? I would be like if I asked how big your rod was... - Then I would be outline 100%. - No! That's not worse than... asking if my girlfriend is a nymph! I just asked you if she dogged sex. I would have asked even though she was frigid. She's not frigid! Are you leaving? Yes. Listen... Could you do me a favor? It's no big deal. What? A business associate of my dad's is gonna come by to pick this up. It's frozen steaks. It's a gift. It's not cold. Dad says that's the way the guy likes them. What are you gonna do? Will you give it to him? Just one second. Audrey. I guess this makes sense. He's got you living with him now? I'm just, I'm just watching his place. Jack's out of town. He is? Shoot! I came by because I was hoping to get my job back. You got me canned because I made a bad cup of coffee. - Remember that? - I'm really sorry about that. How can you fire someone for making a bad cup of coffee? I mean, who do think you are? Juan fucking Valdez? I might have had a future there if you just give me half a chance. Oh, my god. That's my idiot boyfriend. Hold your pants, you freaking psycho! God, he drives me crazy. Since you're on the rug, would you mind putting these on? - I've got them. - Licorice! I hate licorice. I need water or I'm gonna throw up! Thanks to you, I lost my second job in a month and I'm flat broke. You lost another job? I got fired from my waitress job just last Friday. - Why did they fire you? - I don't know. The assistant managers caught me making out with a customer. - Excuse me? - Was my boyfriend. He became my boyfriend after the incident You got any beer in here? - Here we go. - Would you mind putting these on? There's a twist... That's the counter. Listen, Jack is just a real stickler. No kidding. I found that out this morning. Spike's in a real mood... Come on! Shit! You open this door this second or I'm... - Don't worry, nothing broke. - Hey, baby, come on! What are you doing leaving me in the goddamn car? Hurry up. Hold your horses and try acting civilized. This is Tom, the guy I was telling you about. The coffee dude. You've got some black-ass karma headed your way, super freak. He doesn't need no lecture, Mister High and Mighty. Hey, shut that sass-trap of yours, before I bounce you off the wall. Look, I would appreciate it if you would take this outside. I'd appreciate it if you'd go and buy yourself a bagel, Jewy. "Jewy"? - I'm not Jewish, and I don't... - Don't pay attention, he's nuts. I'm nuts? Can we please take this outside? You know what you are? You're a filthy little tramp! - What about you and that waitress? - I never touched her, ever. - Swear? - So help me God. You swear on your mama's life? Hell, woman, I ain't gonna swear on my mama"s life. - Why not? - If you're telling the truth. Won't you swear on your mama's life? I don't feel like I have the right to gamble with my mama's life. That's why you got nothing to worry about... unless you're lying like a hunk of morgue meat. I ain't gonna sit here and get called a liar by no skanking whore! Who are you calling a whore, you shrimpy-dimpy bastard? See Audrey, now you're provoking. - That is a vicious, flat-out... - Is it? I'll whip it out right now to prove to you that she's a lying slut! All right, all right! That is enough! I don't care if you have a tiny shrimp... Or a giant whale, which that's, is probably the case. Tell him you were lying or I'll smash your face in! Can we please just use fists? Come here, you little... - You hit me, you bastard! - I did not and you know it! He hit me! He hit me as sure as I'm standing right here. Did you hit her, Spike? - With an open hand. - So what if it's open? - Then it don't count. - Says who? Says anyone! Ask the Jew! All right, that's it. You two have got to leave. She's not coming, you are not welcome in the doublewide. I don't need your lousy trailer. I'll stay right here with Tom. - Fine, stay with Tom! - Wait a minute. Guys, you need to try to work this thing out. He hit me! He knocked me on my can! I know. Audrey, I know, but it was with an open hand. After all... After all relationships have their ups and downs. You don't want to ruin this great... Oh, God, the bird! o Water! You come back here or Tom's gonna kick your butt! So take that! I'm shaking in my boots... Those two, OJ... Hi, Tom. How are ya? Hey, Lisa. I'm great. Is that OJ? We just had a little drink of water. I haven't heard him squawk in years. He's quite a crazy bird. Anyway, Tom, I just wanted you... to know how much I appreciate you helping me out tonight... but I'd like to crash at a friend's place tonight. Would you think if I asked you to stay the whole night? I don't think your dad would want me staying here. Please? I suppose I could stay. Thanks. I really appreciate it. See you tomorrow. Thank God he's gone. Hey, so is it okay if I stay here tonight? It's not... even my house. Well, I sure as hell don't want any charity. It's not like you owe me anything. So... I'm sorry about that office thing. You didn't mean to get me fired. - Thanks. - Okay. I guess. I'll just go try to find a homeless shelter then. Wait a second. - I suppose you could stay. - Really? Thanks, Tom. You're the best. I'll clean up the kitchen, okay? Just one second! There's somebody at the door. Can I help you? Vasquez sent me here to pick up a package. Red told me you might be stopping by. Hi, I'm Tom. What is this, "Oprah"? Just gimme the goddamn package. I think this is it. If this ain't kosher, I'm gonna break his thumbs. By law, it should be stamped right on the package there. Dinnertime, buddy. OJ. Today's specials include a buffet of mice kabobs. Crap! I got you now, buddy. - Dude, that was cool! - My god. Tommy, easy on the antiques. Was that an owl? - OJ got out! How is he flying? - Well, he is a bird. - He, no, Jack said that he... Shit. I've gotta find him! Don't worry. He'll probably come back when he's hungry. I have to find him or I'm gonna lose my job. This isn't gonna help your chances of getting your job back, either. Where the hell is he? - Tom, relax. - Relax? OJ's loose! This is no time to relax! Tom! He's right over here! Right there, right there! Stop! Stop! Get up. What the hell you doing on my property? Planning to rob me? I was just looking for... I see what you're looking for. Got a thing for young girls? Then why you keep eyeing my wife, you perv? Your...? No, I wasn't looking Are you gonna be back soon? I need you to spot me. Just gimme a minute, honey. - Don't kill me. - I'm not gonna kill you. You let me live, I'll give you my most valued possession. You know what that is, don't you? Evander Holyfield's ear. The part of the ear that Mike Tyson bit off and spit out. - But it's white. - So? - Shouldn't it be black? - If it's still on his head, sure. Anybody knows that a severed ear loses it's color. Sheryl? What happens to an ear if it's severed from your head? It changes color. Duh! Ow! Damn! Audrey! What the hell is going on in here? Who are these people? I invited some friends over to help us look for the owl. And Darryl even fixed the table in the hall. You wouldn't even know that it was broken. We'll get that later. Everyone, this is Tom. - Tom's a real good guy - Audrey could you? I appreciate all your help... but could you make sure that your friends stay out of the house? All of them, or just the colored guy? All of them. That's smart. The colored guy won't take it personal. I have nothing... Look. I am responsible for this house, I can't have these people around. Okay, all right. I got it. You guys? Let's move it out. Thanks, guys. Don't worry, they're all good people. They're not gonna steal nothing or drink too much like the Indians. Look... just make sure they stay outside, okay? Okay, okay. - Lisa! - Hi, Tom. You're home. Why are you home? It's not worth going into. I got in a huge fight with Hans. So... it's over? It's my own fault for dating a guy my dad likes. Really? He's one of his top marketing execs. You know, Harvard law, comes from a good family... top of the tennis ladder at the country club. Tom, can I talk to you for a second? Audrey? She came to talk to your dad. I'm gonna go in my room, You could stay if you want. Audrey, I'll be right there? - Or you could go. - You know, maybe we could... talk later. - What's going on? - We found the owl! - Where is he? - He got away. - Where'd he go? - He hopped into the bushes. - What are you doing? - Getting hamburger meat. It's a good way to lure birds. - They like hamburger meat? - I don't know. I never had a bird. - But most animals respond to meat. - It's a fact. You wanna help me separate the meat? Speed, tell Tom about the Kennedy assassination. This is so cool, Tom. Speed knows who killed JFK. Ask him. Ask him who killed him. All right. Who killed JFK? Desi Arnaz. His life just changed. - What are you doing in here? - This is my closet. I had something in my pants. I was feeding the mouse to the bird... and he, ran down my pants. - I'm sorry... - There it is! That way, in the bedroom! My gosh. Are you okay? I'm good. Don't worry, we'll get it later. Let me help you. I'm really glad you stayed. I needed a good laugh tonight. Thanks. Could I make a bigger ass out of myself? Do you want some wine? No, thanks. - Sure. - Cheers. Cheers. Oh, my god. Is that signed by Walter Payton? Eighty-five Bears. The greatest team ever to play the game. Shut up! Walter Payton, Jim McMahon, Mike Singletary. You may be the coolest girl ever. - You like football? - I love it. I didn't know you guys liked football. No, me and Paul watch the game every Sunday. Paul, too? What's that? It's nothing, it's just something I used to do. That is really good. I didn't know you were an artist. I used to be, but I couldn't get more of my friends to pose nude. You wouldn't be interested? You're blushing. I was just joking. I'm not blushing. I just get red from time to time. You're so funny. Seriously you should really pursue this. You're good. I would, but it doesn't really fit in with my father's plan for me. Future of Midnight Owl Publishing. He's right there! - The door! - We'll get him. Look out! - You okay? - Your dad's gonna kill me. Don't worry about it. It's my brother's. My dad won't care. - Red. - So Dad told you? - About what? - The restraining order. How's that? Red's not allowed within 100 yards of me, my dad, or this house. He didn't mention that. Red's a freak. You don't want to be around my dad... if he finds out anyone was in this house especially Red. It's like wherever he is, there's trouble. I mean, one time he had this big party because Dad was out... of town and my dad came home early... Since the mouse is gone, what say we go back inside? - It was up for an Oscar? - I hate it! I hated that movie! I can't believe you. You're like, you're so... different from how you are at work. What am I gonna do? Walk around with my Walter Payton jersey? I got it. It's like at work, you have to be Lisa Taylor... the loyal employee to the family firm. I have to be... Tom Stansfield, the guy who will do anything for anybody. That's me. I swear, it's like I can just talk to you about anything. I know, exactly. This is crazy. It is. I guess it's because there's no attraction between us. You know, there's none of that sexual tension. It's like I'm with a girlfriend. It's great, isn't it? Maybe we could go to the mall sometime and go shopping. That would be fun. Wouldn't that be fun? You have to listen to this song. You don't want me to dance. Come on, dance with me. I have no idea what I'm doing. Come on, hands together. Now go underneath. Hold on, hold on. Watch, watch. I'm trying to do too much. I'm a dancer. Catch me. I am done. I love this song. Jenny does this strip routine for her boyfriend to this song... it's super sexy. Even you'd appreciate it. I wish I could be like her. She's so free and everything. So what do you think? It's... very nice. So if you weren't gay, this would turn you on? Gay? - Who said I was gay? - My father. You mean it's not true? - No! - No?! I am so embarrassed! I can't believe you let me do this. I didn't mean it! I'm... Why would your father say that I'm gay? You can't blame him entirely. I mean, you're a little effeminate. Don't be hurt. It's okay. Hans is very effeminate too. What exactly did Hans do, anyway? It's not like he did just one thing. It's more about trust. Trust is... important. Trust is everything. I don't know, maybe it's me... I'm just sending out some kind of vibe. I can't attract a decent guy. - What's wrong with me? - Don't even worry about it. You're gonna find another guy so fast. I mean look at you. You're amazing. You really think so? Why do you think I'm here tonight? God, Tom. You didn't know. You thought that... I'll be right back. I'm just gonna go and check and see if Audrey needs towels. You don't have to lie to me. If you have to go to the bathroom, go take a crap and come back. What the hell... What the hell are you doing here man? You bone "Vasquez" out of 20 grand and you ask me what I'm doing? I work for Missus Fields? You think my boss likes to bake cookies? - What are you doing? - You tried to sell me flour. Flour? I don't even know what you're talking about. I'm just house-sitting for my boss. - Who's your boss? - Jack Taylor. Jack Taylor? I did time at Joliet with a Jack Taylor. Average height? Medium hair? Horrible case of Folliculitis on his ass? I wouldn't know about the Folliculitis. Thought you said he was your boss. - He is. - And you never saw his ass? Why would I see my boss' ass? Stands to reason you work for a guy long enough, sooner or later... you're gonna get a glimpse of his ass. I don't know what line of work you're in... but I've never seen my boss' ass. Hey, man... Hey, stop it or I'm gonna call the cops! And tell them what? Your drug deal went bad? You rat me out, I'm gonna carve you up like a turkey... and beat your kids with what's left of you. I don't have any kids. I can wait. Excuse me. Hello? Right. Tommy, let's get clear on something. In 60 minutes, I bring Vasquez what he paid... for or your gift-wrapped nuts. Tom, what's going on? What's going on with your dad's gift? You see that guy? He was gonna kill me. Don't you think you're overreacting a little. Overreacting? The guy had a knife! I don't think that I am overreacting. He probably just had the wrong address. There's gotta be over a dozen Jack Taylors in Chicago alone. I'm gonna go to my dad's bedroom. Tell me if the guy shows up again. All right, you listen to me! You're not supposed to be in this house. Says who? - I know about the restraining. Restraining. I mean, that's just a big misunderstanding. Tom! It's OJ! - Who are you? - I'm here to see Lisa. I'm Hans. Is that so shocking? You're surprised she'd go out with someone like me? You ought to be ashamed of yourself. There are a lot of girls out there... who can see past the fact... that I just happen to be a few pounds overweight. On the inside, I'm just like everyone else. Let me get you a tissue. I'm on the second day of a new diet. I gave up chocolate. I'm really sorry. We just got off on the wrong foot. It's good to meet you, Hans. I'm Tom. I'm just a friend of Lisa's. Maybe you can help me. Is she here? Maybe right now isn't a great time for you to see Lisa. Let's say, we get you a drink? She's probably really upset. We got in a misunderstanding tonight... she left me. That's unfortunate. What happened? I think seeing me naked from behind like that kind of shocked her. So tonight was the first time. It was awesome. I was lying up on the bed one leg up in the air... I had a handful of ass right here, and I had a handful of this. That's when Lisa walked in. What? She caught me in the bed with a blonde. What? Tell me you haven't ever wanted to do it with a... You cheated on her. You know something, Tom? You're right. I guess that was cheating. And now I've gone and lost everyone. I should've known from the start it wasn't right. She kept telling me I reminded her of her dad. You gotta realize that this is over. And you gotta put an end to it, and move on. And get yourself to a better place. And I'm ready. I know what I have to do. I guess this is good-bye. Thanks, Tom! 03], come back! You must be Julie's date. Come in. I'm just here looking for a bird. Make yourself at home, Albert. Julie's still getting ready. My name is Tom. I'm sorry. I'm hard of hearing. Could you speak up, please? My name is Tom. Julie said your name was Albert. I'm afraid that you're mistaken. - Is someone here? - This is Julie's date, Albert. This is my nephew, George. He's blind and crippled. - Nice to meet you. - I'm not deaf. I'll go see what's keeping Julie. She's probably nervous. So you're Julie's date? No. I'm just here looking for an owl. You don't have to make lame excuses. Do you know what the advantages is in being a cripple? No, I can't say that I do. You don't really care to hear much what I have to say, do you? No, it's not that. Go ahead, I'm listening. Sit down, Tom. You know what I gained by becoming a quad? Are you shaking your head? I can't see, you know. I'm sorry. Tell me what you gained. I no longer need my Viagra. Now I can maintain my arousal for hours. That's great. Things have a way of evening themselves out in the long run. No, not really. And do you know why? Why? Because I'm a blind, quad freak, you moron! What, you think women dig this? You think women go: "I wanna give that mutant freak my number"? - Ken Moorehouse. I'm Julie's dad. - Nice to meet you. George boring you with his self-pitying tripe? Not at all, actually. "I'm blind. I'm crippled.” I want to talk to Albert alone for a second. - I can stay if I want to. - Leave the room! Get out! Get out! Get out! Turn it, turn it. Turn it! For God's sake, get out. Sorry. My daughter's gonna be a few minutes. Have a seat, Albert. - Tom. - No, Ken. Right, you're Ken. Before you say anything, Albert, I just want you to know... that Julie is really self-conscious about her appearance... since the accident. Julie. Julie, this is Albert. It's nice to meet you, Albert. Nice to meet you, too. But the thing is, is that... I'm not Albert. That is to say that I'm not your date. There's been a giant misunderstanding. How could you? She doesn't go out on dates. I'm telling the truth. Julie wasn't pretty enough for you, Mr. GQ? No, you don't understand. I understand, Fabio. You broke that poor girl's heart. - No, no, see, I'm not... - Do you think Julie is an idiot? You think she bought your little fairy tale... Mr. I'm Too Sexy for my Medical Booties? Get the hell out of here... or I'll kick your pretty-boy ass to kingdom come! Am I interrupting something? No. It's just that this... Tom, there's two things that we need to talk about. What? First of all, I don't want to wear these booties anymore. No one else is wearing the booties. Fine. What's the other thing? Tina thinks she's got cancer. Do you feel it? What's supposed to be there? I don't... - See, Tina? - Move your hand to the left. Don't you feel anything? - Your breast is the same as mine. - It isn't. There's no comparison. Feel my breast and compare. Do you detect any difference? - You gotta slow down. - That feels good. - This isn't what it looks like. - I believed everything you said. It was all just a bunch of lines, wasn't it? No, Lisa, I swear to you, I meant every word. This is, nothing's going on here. Great, Tom. I'm glad you think I'm a complete idiot. I'm telling you, I was checking these girls for breast cancer. You make me sick. No, Lisa, wait! - She's never gonna forgive me. - Of course she will. This the first time you cheated on her? I didn't cheat on her. You were there, for God's sakes! I know. You were a little grabby... We should just find the owl and worry about your affair later? I'm getting angry and I don't get angry. Speed! Hey, can I ask you a question? - I thought you left. - I did. To get this. All right, why is the fire going? Cozy, isn't it? - You put that down. - Make me. All right. Put the crowbar down... or I will blow your ass to Fucktown! That's right. - Don't you ever threaten me. - But I got a gun. - What are you doing? - Tommy, we both have guns. The only difference is you don't have the guts to use yours. Oh, yeah? What makes you so sure? I'm sure. Jesus! What...? What, are you out of your mind? Stop that! Are you crazy, man? Stansfield Anything to report? Everything's great. I got everything under control. Did OJ get enough water? Could you hold on? I'm gonna shoot you! I hate you! I hate you! - Sir? - The fish tank. It's low. - I'm taking care of that right now. - Good. When I get back I talk to you about the position in Creative. Don't get excited yet. I didn't say you had the job. - We'll discuss it. - Thank you, sir. Bye. Holy shit! Boy, I'm tapped out. You got anything to drink? In the kitchen. Thanks. What happened in here? Tom, did ya have a little accident? You might want to try a few Kegels to kinda tighten it up down there. - That's it! - I'm doing them right now. And release. When in Rome... "Jack Taylor." "Rectacid. Apply to buttocks as needed to reduce redness... and other symptoms of Folliculitis."” Son of a bitch. Did you piss your-self? - No. I did not piss myself. - Looks like you did. I didn't. It was that maniac downstairs. We gotta stop him before he tears this house apart. Know what you gotta do? Give him one of these little babies. - What is it? - A sleeping pill from Speed. Here. So strong, so be careful. It's powerful stuff. Be careful. Excuse me. I just wanted to apologize for pulling that gun on you earlier. That was totally out of line. I don't even know your name. - I'm TJ - That's, that's nice. Maybe I was out of line by pissing all over everything. That was funny. I've always enjoyed a good prank. What are you drinking there? Whiskey. You want some? Plenty of booze around here, that's for sure. I'll take a shot of bourbon. My god. What? Look at those two blondes going... are there three of them? - Where? - Right there. Man, they left. I was all psyched up for some passion. Lesbians are very special. I'll drink to that. Cheers. Audrey! My god! He's like a human vibrator. What is wrong with him? I don't know. Did you slip him the pill? Then that must be it then. You didn't give him the pill with whiskey, did you? You're not supposed to mix the two. Audrey, you did not tell me that. Everyone knows you're not supposed to mix booze with pills! Is he gonna be okay? Don't worry, he'll be fine. I used to be a paramedic. I think I found OJ. OJ I don't care about! Audrey, call nine-one-one. - I'm telling you. He'll be fine. - Are you sure? - Give him some rest. - Watch T.J. use this. It's not loaded, but he doesn't know that. - Julie... - From... Down the block. You mind if I come in? Why don't we go to that room, over there? Do you mind if I sit down? Sure. Sorry to butt in. Hi, I'm Red. Nice to meet you. I realized you were telling the truth when my date showed up. - Of course he didn't stick around. - That guy is a bum. I'm sure that had nothing to do with you. No, I know it did. I've never had any guys attracted to me, even before the accident. Now that cannot be true. About six months ago I was hitchhiking... and the trucker tried to rape me, but other than that... You're gonna tell me you've never had a real boyfriend? Once, but I think he just felt sorry for me. How long did that last? About six years, and then one day he just left. Another woman? - No. He got hit by a bus. - See, that's not your fault. He didn't seem to try very hard to avoid the bus. I think he just wanted out of the relationship. Julie, why don't you sit in this chair? I'm starting to feel a bit woozy. All right, I have to go find OJ. So, Red if you could watch things for me, that would be great. Gotcha. Look, I think you're being way too hard on yourself. I bet there have been a lot guys who have been attracted to you. No, he was the only one. What about that trucker? I mean, he was obviously attracted to you. That trucker probably would have raped anyone. I doubt that. You were probably pretty special to him. That's so sweet of you, Red. I'm not just jerking your chain, either. I mean it. What are you doing to the lawn? It's okay, Tom. We just had to bury TJ. Bury? What? You mean, he's... You said he was gonna be okay! I thought you were a paramedic. Well, I took a course. You, you can't just bury him! We're not gonna put him in my car. Forget it. I'm calling nine-one-one. - That's for emergencies. - What do you think this is? The guy's dead. In 20 minutes, he's still gonna be dead. There's no sense of urgency here. We have to call the cops and report it. And tell them what? The truth, that there was... an accident. - They might not see it that way. - Face it, Tom, you did kill him. You gave me the pill! - I didn't tell you to kill nobody. - You didn't tell not to use whiskey! - Well, if you'd listen to me... - You didn't say anything! I'd think that you would listen to me. There's no time for blame games. One of you spread some leaves, make it look good. I am not gonna help you conceal a dead body. Don't you think we should say something? You know what? She's right. Some kind of last rites or eulogy or something like that? - I am so screwed. - We should say something. You know what? Say something. Just make it quick. Lord, this day we lay to rest TJ, who was a... I really didn't know him. Tom, you knew him the best. Why don't you say something? Me? All I know is that the guy was a violent sadistic goon... that was into lesbians. Amen. - I can't believe you're still here. - You have to let me explain. Look... tonight was just a big mistake. That's all there is to it. What you saw, with the girls? All that was weird timing. Red? - What's Red doing here? - Red? Red was in the neighborhood and he stopped by. Nothing really bad happened tonight. - Is he the reason OJ's gone? - No. OJ got loose and that's a little problem... but we're gonna find him and we're looking for him, so... What's this? Tom killed a guy and we're burying the body. That was bad. Now you're overreacting, because... If anybody moves there's gonna be a big hole... where her brain used to be. Go ahead, shoot. Come on, what are you waiting for? Waste the bitch! No, I don't give a shit. I'm not joking, asshole. Pull the trigger. Come on. Come on! I think you're just all talk. Looks like we've both got guns. Who's gonna shoot first this time? Well, that should do it. You were so brave. It's not even that big of a deal. This gun's not... I never should have doubted you. You risked your life for me. Audrey found bullets in the kitchen and I may have reloaded it. I did. Excuse me. Does anyone here know a Jack Taylor? - Why? - This dude just called. He said if I don't pick him up at the train station in 15 minutes... I'm out of a job. What do you suppose that means? My god. That's what I thought, cause I ain't got no job. - He's coming home early. - Don't worry about it. I'll take care of everything. Trust me. - Just don't drive too fast. - Got it. Maybe you should put that away. As long as we're in Thailand for the meeting on Monday. We can pick it up when we refuel in Hawaii. Do you want to get something to drink or go to the bathroom? We'll take the departmental heads now... and the Creative team in a couple of weeks. Stansfield, what are you doing? Nothing, sir. Hold on a moment, please. Stansfield... why don't you just concentrate on the driving... and let me get on with making my call? Wait! What is it now, Stansfield? Nothing, sir. Almost home. How'd this get in there? - Be careful with that. - I will. Good thing I found it. There's several ways to properly dispose of a handgun... none of which include putting it in a garbage bag. Freeze! Police! Freeze! Let go of the girl and put your hands in the air! You're completely surrounded, T.J.! Put down your weapons and put your hands on your head! No, you guys, wait. He's not T.J. I'm Lisa Taylor. This is my dad's house. We've received numerous reports from this neighborhood. Theft... I know you probably think we may have killed somebody, but... Tom didn't know he poisoned the guy. We thought he was dead when we buried him. But he seems okay now. His head's just a little bloody from where we hit with the shovel. And I swear, when Tom shot the gun off... he didn't think it was loaded because I put the bullets back in. So if you all just step inside, you'll see there's nobody dead. He may have had the wind knocked out of him temporarily... but with a little first aid, I think he'll be just fine. Holy mother of God! Yes, I see. I see. Okay, fine. Could you say that again? You're breaking up. One moment, please. OJ! I just can't understand why you would do this. Hans, what were you thinking? He'll be fine. He may complain about a sore throat, but... he's in a lot better shape than this chandelier. I'd hate to be here when the owner gets back. You can say that again. - What a hell! - You're okay? - Oh my God! - Daddy! - What was that? - Watch the glass, OK, everybody? - Let's get him out of the car. - Oh my God! Daddy! - Stay back, remain calm. - You're all right? That's the one spying on me through the bushes. Then he shot the bullet through Julie's bedroom window. Here, tell them, Julie. Tom wants the body in here. Put me down. Stansfield, what have you done? Lisa, pack your things. You're coming with me to Thailand. No! Get his ass outta here. It's funny you should mention the Word "ass". Jack, why don't we start by talking about yours? Excuse me? Lisa, your father is not who you think he is. The whole publishing operation... it's a great cover. Now, how'd you do it? What'd you do? Did you hollow out the books? Locating the plant in Thailand! It's genius! What are you talking about? What am I...? Jack, I would have believed ya, until I met this man... who seems to know a lot about ya. Recognize this? I hear it's very effective in relieving Folliculitis. I don't have Folliculitis. He's giving me no choice. - He's giving me no choice. - What are you doing? This is insane! Take a look at your dad's ass and tell me I'm insane? Look at it! Look at it! I don't have Folliculitis, you blithering idiot! Well, guys... the ointment must have worked. Wait. I have something to show you. My real name is Jack Taylor... Junior. Red is my nickname. Now you know why. I'm the whole reason that T.).'s here. Goddamn it, Red. You've been dealing drugs out of my house. No, I swear. I gave him a bag of flour. I dumped a kg of it in the toilet. I'm finished dealing for good. The lime green toilet with the wooden seat? Why? Wait a second. He's flying. He's flying! Get him out of my sight. Now! Lisa, let's go. - That's the one! He got my ear! - Got your ear? Lisa, wait! OJ, come to Daddy. How's my little boy? You're going with him? What choice do I have? He needs me. Are you actually feeling sorry for him? He's manipulating you and you are buying it. You do what you gotta do. I am gonna bail Tom out of jail. - With what, your drug money? - I stole this out of Dad's safe. Somebody has gotta to help Tom. Nothing that happened here last night was any of his fault. It's funny. The nicest guy in the world's... the only one with enough balls to stand up to Dad. All he wanted to do was to spend some time with you. Look what it gets him. Classic Dad. I'm not allowed in the house, you're not allowed out of it. He doesn't care about us, only that stupid bird. - Red, can I tell you something? - Sure. I know this is gonna sound weird, but... ever since I was a little kid... I used to always wish that I was that stupid bird. Lisa, it's about time you talk to Dad. At least tell him how you feel. Don't you see? We have no reason to be afraid of him. Don't let him do this to you. Red bailed me out... and told me you were here, and I'm not letting you go. But I'm... You're gonna let me finish. I went through hell last night... and it was my fault because I let people do it to me. You're gonna make the same mistake. This isn't what you want. This is what your father wants. And you know what? Maybe you and I... never are gonna work... and that hurts. But not as much as watching you be controlled by a ruthless tyrant... that would screw his mother if he thought it'd help him get ahead. I'm not going. She's not going? Is this whole concept too complicated for you? No. No. All right. What, I, what made you stay? That. How did you guys...? We finally had our long overdue talk. Then who's taking your place in Thailand? He is. What's this? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I don't want to go. I'm afraid. Nonsense. Everyone knows that... Asian people are very intimidated by... - Tall men? - Canadians? - Republicans? - Blacks? Henderson. I won't have that kind of thinking in this company. There's no room for racism here. You're fired. The point that I'm getting to is with a big part of the team away... I'm gonna want you to take over the creative department. - Me? - No need to be modest. I saw those ideas you left in the living room. Your theory on the JFK thing, brilliant. And the moon landing a hoax? You're on to something there. That's the kind of thinking that's gonna sell books. Thank you, sir. Bye, Dad. Daddy. Have a safe flight. Well, Dad... that's fantastic. You promoted Tom. I figure anyone who's got the guts to piss on... my Persian carpets has gotta have what it takes. Stansfield! What the hell are you doing? Just trying to get my job back, sir. After everything that happened after all I went through... guess it was my lucky day. And I'm not the only one. Lisa and Red's suggestions... Jack restructured the company from top to bottom... even instituting casual Fridays, every day. Henderson's 27 straight day on the job without being fired. OJ's back off the drugs and now he only drinks beer. But he still has an occasional flashback. Jack begged Audrey to come back, but... got a job at of all places, a coffee shop. This is terrible! Hans succeeded in turning the factory in Thailand... but apparently he's struggling to cope with the local customs. - Back of the bus! - Excuse me? You people belong back of the bus! That's an outrage! I'm not gonna let you treat me like that merely because I'm... Smoking! Smoking belongs back of the bus! As for me, with my new promotion... could at last write books based on my own experiences. So I did. And Lisa was finally able to pursue a career that she loved. You know, you ever heard someone say that old expression... "Why does everything bad always happen to me?" I don't get those people... because I've learned if they stop and look around... they'd realize... that everything happens for a reason. I told you he'd see the ass sooner or later.
