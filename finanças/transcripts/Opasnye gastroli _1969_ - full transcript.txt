"He was breathing an aroma of many roses before this. "He was not a boor. "His mama is a grand lady, papa is a millionaire. "He was sprayed with a strong smell in the childhood. "And rose - schoolgirl began a love affair with him. "And rose - schoolgirl began a love affair with him. "And devil incarnate, that narcissus, lady-killer "told her to go to him from the garden. "And rose said “ah“, reddened "and gathered her clothes. "And tarzan captured all her petals. "Mama was with friends, Chestnut has already fallen off. "Rose searched for the happiness and didn't see how "poppy dried because of love and passion. "But she hardly thought how stuffy the vulgar colour is. "All the petals has fallen off and there is no more rose. "And the mourning rest was in the black poppy's belly. "Chestnut was crying when bloomed in spring". What are you looking for? Want a cucumber? This or that? You are sly. - What's your name? - Antip. I'll go for a rifle. Go out, quickly. Quick. Go. Quickly, Fedia. Drive to the port. Stop, I'll shoot. Peome! But, darling. The theatre is robbed. Who was shooting? I was. I came to the storehouse and saw two people. They struck my head and I remember nothing after it. - What had happened? - The guy went to the port. With me! - Catch up. - Yes, sir. Turn quick. Rascals! I have goods. Armenian carpets, Russian fur. Who wants to earn money? The streamship will be in the morning. - I don't believe. - I swear. Don't you lie, barin? He wants to do harm. Do you have children? Do you need to feed them? And I have wares and it must be loaded. I pay in cash. Follow me! - Free the street! - The barin told us to take the load. He pay in cash. Probably, it is on Arnautskaya. There are storehouses there. On Arnautskaya. Follow me! - Good afternoon. - Listen. Strain your stupid brain and try to remember who struck you. - I don't remember. - Remember or I'll send to you Siberia. I've been shooting, I've been whistling. There was dark, he grabed my rifle and struck me. In what were they dressed? Dressed? I don't remember. I've been shooting, whistling. Shut up, fool. An artist comes You have to remember. - Must. Understand? - Must. Understand. Only write that I've been shooting, whistling. Bengalsky. Please, come here. - Thank you. - Sit down. Sit down. What can you say about the robbery? Nothing alas. Don't you thing that everything was perfectly organized? Yes. Like everything that police can't prevent. The theatre‘s property disappeared. I have to cancel music-hall turn. And the criminals still avoid meeting with you. Alas, I have to work on it now. But I think that... the case... of the theatre‘s robbery... is not a criminal but political. Political? I don't think so. I have reasons to suppose that the illegal literature was transported in Odessa in the boxes. In our theatre? For God's sake, Ivan Taryalovich. What can you say about it? - What's this? - It is not a programme. Yes. How are we involved? I wanted to find it out from you. Got it. I think this is an insult directed at the troupe, firstly. And secondly, we are artists, we are not interested in politics. You know it. Your declaration deserves the most intent attention. Mstislav Udaloy comes in Odessa in two days. He brings a consignment of properties bought in France. I ask you to confiscate all the cargo in the port. And to check it. We will use your suggestion. The cargo will be confiscated. - Would you be so kind. - Good-bye. - Can I go? - Of course. Please. - Watchman. - Yes, sir. What? Not him. Maybe you have someone else? I'll recognize. Wait, I... Lingerie, helmets, wooden weapons. Nothing. - Search. - Yes, sir. What are they doing? Good afternoon. - I'm glad to greet you... - Thank you. Our arrival is darkened with this. How shall we understand? You see, Viscount... I can't interfere in the businesses of secret police. At last, I don't want to see all of it. This is a rummage. By all means, we don't want to be an exeption. Mr. governor-general. Let them rummage our bags too. Course not, madam. A carriage to Viscount. Good-bye. We are kept here like prisoners. We won't stop here, let's go to “Bristo||“. - What about the souvenirs? - We'll send them to the theatre. Well. Did you bring? Yes, we did. - Ready. - After. Call Maksim. We may not get anything today. It can't be, comrades. This is not possible. Adrei is followed. I think they can't bring anything today. We are leaving today evening. Next we'll be after a month. We have to try to transfer with another ship. But we don't have such a possibilities. Ours are taken on “Stanislav”. We have nobody on other ships. If I am not able to deliver the labour newspaper and the leaflets in Novorossiysk the 1st May strike will slip out. So, I'm going first, you... Mademoiselle Sophie. Devil. We don't need him. Maybe he has found out something. - Open the door, madam. - Answer. - One minute. - Suitcases, quickly. - Kolia, I'm afraid. - Don't be afraid, I'll be back soon. Don't worry, everything will be fine. Go! You came without any notice. You are discomfiting me. I appreciate your good attitude. It was sad that you didn't visit me more. I'm afraid that our meetings can turn out to be much more pleasant now. Why? You are so cute. I remember your charming jokes. Yours excellency, lam just an artist but I don't want to clank the fetter because the chief of police aspires my bride. Only you can help me. I need to know why the Viscount de Kordell's suitcase was brought you and where it is. Can you be so jealous? Last time you almost sent governor-general to Siberia and now Viscount is in trouble. Excuse me but I have to see the contents of the suitcase. - Why are you joking so sad? - I'm not joking. It's my service duty to be here. I have to see what in the suitcase is. - You are joking? - No, I am not. You're putting me in a terrible situation. I am a woman and I can have the secrets. And I am a policeman. The disclosure of secrets is my profession. Alas, mademoiselle. Our work breaks the most intimate human strings. It's my service duty to be here. Bring the suitcase, please. - What suitcase? - That's the viscount's present. Viscounfs present? You, mademoiselle? - Kolia, I'll explain everything. - Leave us alone. Impossible, bring the suitcase. - I beg you. - Sorry, I can't help you. - Where is it? - There. Please. Open. Excuse me. But rummage is not my profession. What does this mean? I suppose, we can speak in another conditions. I thought it was the end. Excuse me. Not at all, Kolia. Everything was perfect. - Quick. - We must change the suitcases. Don't you think that it won't finish good? I appriciate your ardour but you can't suspect everybody. Excuse me. But it is worth sacrificing a ten in order to catch a one. I don't judge you but will Viscount de Kordell excuse you? He has a lot of contacts and he won't like the interference in his life. - But I was sure. - And mistaken. Whom are you following? I'll complain about you to the police's chief, rascals. I'll send you to Siberia. Shut up! Bastards. I ask you to be more circumspect in order to avoid the scandals connected with you and me. Leave the artists alone. Can I help you? Stop playing the fool. I've hardly extricated. Is that you? Whata mug. Well done. Viktor! Take it. - Well, sorry. - Ok. This is not funny. By the way, the originals are here for you. The leaflets to the port workers. They appointed the policemen to look after us for the period of the trip. Under the guise of security. To prevent the further thefts of property. But it can harm the business. Yes. Well. It's time to go. We have nearly gone mad. I can imagine. It turns out too easy. - Thank God. - Not so easy. It only seems so. Well, comrades, thank you very much. - See you. - Good luck. Send our regards to the comrades. Take a seat before we left. OK. You know, it seems to me that I'm running constantly and I won't have time sometimes. What's happening with you, Nikolai? Do you remember we leaded that character for three hours and went away. When I was late on the performance? Yes, I do. That's good, but what shall we do with the governor's chapel? - How did you say? - With the governor's chapel. - You are a genius. - Of course, but what shall we do? You've invented everything. I have to go. OK. - I wish you happy tour. - We'll meet with you in Kharkov. Messrs. Policemen. A catastrophe. My Lord! A three Gypsys have got under the carriage. Oh, my God. That's all. A music-hall turn precipices, help us, please. You have to dress and go on the stage. We are not artists. You have to do nothing. Only to sing la-la-la. - La-la-la? - La-la-la, nothing more. I beg you. For the sake of art. Ok. Everyone gets 50 roubles. The honour of Odessa depends on you. We can do it for the sake of the honour of Odessa. - Yes. - Thank you very much. Grease-paint! "Sadness lies on me like a stone, it pulls me in a whirlpool. "Why does any word wound painfully now? "Because there is a Gypsy encampment somewhere here. "And they disturb a soul in the evenings.
