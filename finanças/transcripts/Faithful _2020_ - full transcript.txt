"Algeria is France. "And who among you, ladies and gentlemen, "wouldn't do anything in your power to protect France?" François Mitterrand, Interior Minister November 12, 1954 Algiers Barberousse Prison June 19, 1956 Guide us in life and in death and spare us from hell. Glory to God. And peace to his messengers. Praise to God, Lord of the universe. Coffee? Cigarette? Zabana. Courage. God is with you. Please forgive me for the evil I've done! I'll die but Algeria will live! Long live Algeria! Algerian Electricity and Gas Company Iveton! Stop him! Don't move! MY TRAITOR, MY LOVE Police, open up! - Open up! - Coming! Open up! Mrs. Iveton? Yes. Sit. Your husband planted a bomb at work and we think there's another. Where were you this morning? I start very early and finish at 2 pm. People come and go at your place. I have friends. Is that a crime? - Do you frequent Arabs? - Only normal, in an Arab country. You consider it a country? Sit. Paris region, two years earlier - For me? - Yes. You don't drink? Sure, sure. - You buy drinks for strangers? - No, only for exceptional dancers. If you're strange, I'll take it back. - Where are you from? - Algeria. I'm getting tests done in Paris. I've got a little issue. I need air. Humidity is good for my lungs. So here I am. I see. What do you do? It's my day off. That's cheating. My life isn't very exciting, but I have a secret weapon. My gaze. Want a drink? It's my round. Yes. You're leaving? Which way? Can I get a ride? I came on foot. I'm staying at the Café Bleu. Who was he? Who cares? Another pathetic man telling me what to do. I dance with whoever I want. I do what I want. If my son turns out like them, I'll strangle him in his sleep. - We're not all bad, you exaggerate. - Know what? I'm Polish. With all I've heard here since I was little, I have no need to exaggerate. - You're Polish? Where from? - Why, do you care? - You know Poland? - I'd like to, I'm a communist. If you care, I have great stories about the communists. Ever heard of the Political Police? The arrests, the political prisons. Sure, communism is swell. - In theory. - Are you always this aggressive? - Speaking my mind is aggressive? - Where I work, Arabs get paid half. You work every day just for enough to survive. If you're the right color. Only the communists care. I have great stories too. When France was liberated, everyone turned resistant. Meanwhile, Muslims were slaughtered in Sétif and Guelma. Ever heard of them? Who talks about that? - You're lucky. - Think so? Yes. You can tell your stories. With your communists in power, that may change. I suppose you'll call that a capitalist lie. I see injustice every day. My father is stuck there. In Poland. The authorities won't let him come back. I don't want to take you to Café Bleu. Because of my son. I mean, it's on the other side of town. And I'm not in the mood. Thanks for getting me closer. Goodnight. Iveton, you're out! Hélène? Hélène! Are you crazy? I heard him crying. He's lost. Where are you? In your arms. I mean your hand. On your lower back. Strange, it feels higher. - Really? - Yeah. - Do you feel my hand now? - Yes. I'm going down to your lower back, coming up along your belt slowly, and stopping. Now my fingernails are walking on your stomach. And then? Your neck. I put my head on your shoulder and I breathe. My hand is going down to unfasten your belt. You're scared! You're yelling, screaming... - You're... an angry person. - A woman? - You're hitting yourself. - Scratching? You have claws. A tiger! King Kong, Mom. You guys are dumb. King Kong, right. There's a great football pitch there. Do you play? A little. Henri's a great player. Who's Henri? My friend. He's like a brother. Hélène told me about your husband. We're here, Mom. What'd she say? Are you a communist, Fernand? Yes. Like my father. We always have been. What got into you? Don't leave me alone like that. Anyone there? You make me mad. Why'd you say that? She doesn't have to like me. We can avoid politics. She does have to like you. Put yourself in her shoes. Algeria is far away. You're going home, but me? I don't want her to be afraid. I don't want her saying I've made another bad choice. What's so funny? So your decision is made? If my decision was made, I'd tell you. Are you not telling me? Ok. I'm telling you, with your goofy smile and total lack of diplomacy, that I, Hélène, of relatively sound mind and slightly older than you, have decided... Sorry. I'm the dad. Nice to meet you. I'm the mom. - Who's this big boy? - Jean-Claude. These are my friends, Henri and Baya. - Nice to meet you. - Hello. Cheers! Feels strange. Like I'm in a hotel. Or a boarding house. You know? It doesn't feel like we moved in together. On the way here, I saw three streets. And now I'm here. There's a whole city out there, full of people, full of streets, red lights... But I don't know it. Where are you going? Hey, Fernand! Eyes closed, mouth open. Wait. - Well? - Delicious. It's called ftaïr. Algiers is your home. I love you. Get your Journal d'Alger, 15 francs! Journal d'Alger, 15 francs! I'm guilty It's a horrible crime Will I save my head? Look what we caught! Henri, toss me a sea urchin. - Here. - Thanks. Beach off limits to dogs and Arabs - Wanna taste one? - Sure. - Like it? - Yeah. Try it. - When do you leave? - End of next month. - Where to? - Miliana. 57th Battalion. Picturing myself in a uniform makes me want to puke. Defense! Come here. Come on. What are you up to? A little party meeting? Just playing. Is that allowed? Yeah? Is this allowed? Whose are they? Just playing? Split up. - Split up! - Split up, you dirty Arabs. Go on. Got something to say? Let's haul 'em in. C'mon. Get moving! - You have a cat? - She has a cat. He's a little vagabond. - What's his name? - Titi. And sometimes Attila. Quite different. It changes with my moods. - He's more often Attila. - Oh no! He peed on me. - Kick him out. Out, Titi! - It's ok. He's a bad kitty. But he'll make a nice roast. - You're mean. - Roast Titi. Shut up. Anyway. He's playing innocent now. Fernand, give me a hand. Be ready for anything. They execute the convicted. Torture everyone, even women. They're killing the movement. - And we just stand by? - I didn't say that. We do as we said. No cowardice. Yes. But beware of others. The less you talk, the less you risk. Thanks. - What's Henri got in mind? - What do you mean? What's he planning? Do you know anything? No. Really? So he'll be serving France in his regiment? If he served France, I wouldn't be his wife. Do you realize what you're saying? He'll do what he has to do. You said it yourself. Those who opposed the occupation of France resisted. It's the same here. I asked Henri if he wanted a child with me. What'd he say? He told me about the Constantine massacre. He saw a paratrooper pick up an Algerian baby. The baby was hungry and kept screaming. The paratrooper wiped off the end of his pistol and slipped it in the baby's mouth to suckle. To pacify him. Then he fired the gun. Into the baby's mouth. In front of the mother. They've treated us like dogs for 100 years. It has to end. It won't end if we act like them. Easy for you to say. - You're French. - Am I? Bullshit. Goodnight. What's wrong? Our lives are one thing. But I have a son. We have a son! - Understand? - Calm down. I'm calm. What's Henri planning? - He's dragging you in. - No. I'm in as deep as he is. In what? - Are you going to kill people? - No, I'm not insane! Then lie to me. Tell me some lies. Everyone lies. Lying is good. It's not complicated. If you two must discuss it, go elsewhere. Anywhere, as long as I can't hear you! I want to believe everything. But help me! Ok. Yes? Come in. Good evening. Is Fernand here? Yes. Your dad's here. - How are you? - What is it? I need you to house someone. Just two days. I can't keep him at home. - Ok. - Thank you. - Where is he? - Here. Hélène, sorry for the disturbance. Thanks, brother. Good evening. Follow me. Gentlemen of the Armed Forces, Magistrates, ladies and gentlemen, all rise! Presiding Judge Roynard. Fall in! Attention! At ease. Bring in the defendant. - Traitor! - Assassin! Fernand. - Monster! - Bastard! Quiet. Defendant, please rise. Mr. Iveton, Fernand. Born June 12, 1926, at Clos Salembier in Algiers. Lathe operator for Algerian Electricity and Gas. Married to Hélène Ksiazek and adoptive father of Jean-Claude Ksiazek. The court must answer questions concerning the indictment. First question. Is the defendant guilty of having, on November 14, 1956 in Algiers, attempted to destroy buildings with an explosive substance? Second question. Were these attempts made on occupied buildings or residential housing? Mr. Iveton? State your political beliefs and activities. At 16, I joined the Young Communist League. In 1948 I became a militant for the Algerian Communist Party. I was secretary of my local cell in Le Clos Salembier. When the party was banned in 1955, I went inactive for several months. Shortly before the attempted attack, it appears you joined a group linked to the National Liberation Front. Is that true? It was the only way to express our ideas. To act in accordance with my political beliefs. We simply want to obtain social equality for the Algerian people. I consider myself Algerian. Not all Europeans are anti-Arab. Mr. Iveton, stick to the facts or sit down. I have here two pieces of paper you had when you were arrested. They indicate two bombs were set to explode between 7:25 and 7:30 pm. I know nothing about the second bomb. I refused to take it. The second bomb was found in a police van outside headquarters in Algiers. Like the first bomb, it was disarmed by our diligent police force. Fernand Iveton, how can we be sure this is your first action? The second bomb wasn't me. How can we believe you? Have you no blood on your hands? Once again sir, I am Algerian. I take action for a better future for the Algerian people. I'd never have planted it if I thought it would hurt anyone. And yet, you planted the bomb in a functioning work area, on the shop floor near the locker rooms, near the factory residence and worse, near gasometers and highly inflammable installations. The residence is 100 meters away. The gasometers are 150 meters away. I was only targeting equipment. The bomb was set to explode after work hours. Keeping everyone safe was foremost. You've given us some names. But you refuse to identify other members of your group. This is your last chance to tell us who gave the orders and who helped you. I've told you everything, I can't make up names. I ask the court to judge me alone. You're known to be close to the traitor Henri Maillot. True? We were childhood friends. We grew up together. Were you aware of his plans to divert the loading of military weapons on April 5, 1955? No. We're talking about 123 machine guns, 140 revolvers, 57 rifles, grenades, uniforms... Enough to arm a number of rebel units. You knew nothing? Be seated, Mr. Iveton. - While in prison... - Later, Mr. Iveton. I call the first witness to the stand. He did more than a Muslim. For he had no duty of sacrifice. He will go to Heaven. Leave Henri where he is. Find the swine that killed him. Kill them all. Did you know about Henri and the cargo? So what do we do? No instructions have come. - The union must have plans. - Can't you see? Arabs on one side, French on the other. Not our problem, they say. Everyone's afraid or doesn't care. Give it time, it'll come together. Are you kidding? By the time it comes together, how many rebels will have died? They're thwarting organization. If we wait, we're dead. What should we do? - Go on the offensive? - I made contact. Time to take action. You talk too much. Watch your tongue. You'll attract trouble. You certainly won't. - Peasant. - Don't insult me, moron! What difference does it make? If you don't fight with us, what'll you do? The continent doesn't give a damn. We Algerians belong here. - If we don't unite, we're fucked. - You talk too much. Stop! He can't have died in vain! Death to traitors The freedom fighters are organizing. In agreement with the Front. But if you decide to join, it's in a personal capacity. Units are 4 or 5 members max. We don't know the others, no names. I liaise with command. No individual action. We gather only at meetings. If you're arrested, you'll be tortured. Best case, prison. Worst case, death. You must be prepared to go underground. To cut all ties with family. No matter what. Be careful. Is that the material found on the site? Yes, that's the bomb defused by the munitions officers. I'll read from the police forensic report about the two explosive devices. "Several of these devices exploded on September 30, 1956 "at the Milk Bar and the Cafeteria in Algiers. "November 9: Rue Michelet and Colonna d'Ornano. "November 12: a bus on Rue Michelet, "at the Hussein Dey station and the Monoprix at Maison Carrée." These are acts of heinous destruction. There were deaths. Hundreds were wounded, some amputated. Captain Hugues, can you confirm Mr. Iveton's statement following his arrest? I took the defendant's statement. He related the circumstances and acts he's accused of. He spoke of his own free will. I made my statement under torture. I was blindfolded for days and water tortured to falsely confess. I'm not aware of that. Mr. Iveton, let us finish hearing the witness. I'm covered in scars. They beat me like a dog. - Let us continue. - I was tortured! - Let him go! - Quiet, Madam. - Look! - Let him go! Your Honor, we demand a doctor examine our client to determine the cause of the wounds. Granted. We'll adjourn for medical examination. The hearing will resume at 2 pm. Please remove your shirt. Your lawyer tells me your wounds date from November 14th, the day of your arrest. You may lower your arm. Look up. Stand up, please. Has there been blood in your urine? Doctor? Excuse us. Hello. Here you go. Seriously? A .25 caliber? What can we do with that? From Henri's diverted cargo? Yes. Who's the target? Whoever we propose. I spotted a guy. A fascist from the Belcourt Ultras. I know his movements. I can do it. - Why are you here? - To be with you! - Don't do it again! - I wanna fight with you. You're not allowed out. We risk arrest! Get inside. Goodnight. Go to your room. What was he doing with you? - It's over, never mind. - Never mind? Are you kidding? You hide strangers here, people I don't know. You go out at night with my son! There's a curfew. I'm sick of being afraid. - You promised no danger! - Not so loud. I'll be as loud as I want. I came here for you. I wanted us to be happy. I wanted to be together. But now... Look at me! We only live once. I can't just sit by. We're not just sitting by. We're here. We haven't fled. We've stayed with the others. - Stop! - If this goes on, we'll leave. Jean-Claude and I will leave. Stop! It stinks of death here, Fernand! You didn't marry me, you married Henri. - And this madness... - Shut up! You wanna leave? Get the fuck out! Take your things. Go back to France. If I didn't fight, I couldn't look myself in the eye. We'd be screwed anywhere. Excuse us. One person, upper deck. - Sorry, not you. - Mom! Boat's leaving. Don't worry. Everything's fine. Here. I promise I'll see you soon. You'll be back when things are better. I'll write. I love you. Go on. Go on. I'm with you. I want to know everything now. I don't want them to hurt you. If something happens, destroy the papers in the desk. What else can we do? Plans must be carried through. If we act, we act. Mustapha's switchboard. - I can access it. - Why not. If we cut off communications, that'll make waves. I have an idea for a target. Can we get bombs? Maybe. Through intermediaries. My factory. We cut the city electrical lines. Algiers goes dark. We must coordinate operations. Take precise action. Have a back-up plan. I'll see what the higher-ups say. Whether the intention was to kill innocents or not, the crime remains the same. This crime, and it is a crime, a very nearly murderous one, is unpardonable. Chance and chance alone spared you, Mr. Iveton, from becoming an assassin. What if your foreman had not been vigilant enough to prevent the explosion? What would you have done after your sinister deed? Joined the underground, like your felon friend Henri Maillot? Taken up arms to carry out still more atrocities against your fellow citizens, your own country? You're a traitor, Fernand Iveton. We have a duty to prevent you from doing irrevocable harm. We have a duty to prevent the return of the atrocities that have plunged the city into mourning. Think of the children recently mutilated at the Milk Bar. Of those in that public bus. Think also of France, whose prestige and global influence are tarnished by such monstrous acts. As a consequence, we ask you to declare the defendant guilty of all charges, in accordance with Articles 2, 434 and 435 of the Penal Code. We request the death penalty. The defense has the floor. Mr. Smadja, public defender. Mr. President, your Honors. You speak of exemplarity, Mr. Prosecutor. And you're right. France must set an example. France is the land of human rights, hence its prestige. Speaking of which, I'd like to point out how little time my team and I had to prepare our client's defense. My client did not target occupied structures or residences. The bomb was placed in an abandoned building. Fernand Iveton demonstrated a clear intention to cause no victims. In addition, the experts' report on the bomb, which you read, but which we did not previously have access to, says, "The bomb "has limited destructive capacities. "Its blast effects are minimal. "A range of 3 or 4 meters maximum." Thus, the acts committed in that disused building targeted only material damage of limited importance, with no intention to cause human suffering. These acts represent an attempt at sabotage. Therefore, I request a requalification of the offense. What kind of terrorism is it, when there is no intention to kill? The court must make its judgement based on the precise case before it. Mr. President, your Honors, today, this man comes before you in difficult circumstances. The times we're living in are extremely harsh. We need justice more than ever. And justice demands that we examine the facts calmly. At ease. Defendant, please rise. After hearing all the witnesses, and taking into account that the military medical report cannot establish when the defendant was wounded, the court has deliberated and rendered its verdict. To the first question, by a majority prescribed by section 90 of the Code of Military Justice, the court finds the defendant guilty as charged. To the second question, "Were the buildings occupied?" Yes. As a consequence, the court condemns the French national and civilian Iveton, Fernand, to death. Off with his head! Assassin! He will be beheaded in the Algiers prison compound in accordance with Articles 2, 12, 26, 36, 434 and 435 of the Penal Code and Article 5 of the law of March 16, 1956. This conviction is effective and applicable as of today. - Algeria is France! - Long live France! Death to the enemy! Court is adjourned. Take him away. - I filed an appeal. - When will we get a response? - It depends. - Depends on what? The people who will handle his case. - That's why I met that officer. - Be honest with me. What's going on? Your husband's trial was a mockery. Like everything that happens in that court. The presiding judge, Roynard, sold his soul to the French Special Powers. He does overtime in the courts for extra cash and colonel status. A 6-hour trial for a case of this magnitude with such a tragic verdict is inhuman. A settling of scores masquerading as justice. - Then we must go to France for justice. - It's tricky. All Paris is interested in right now is reestablishing ties with the U.S. The Americans want the colonies dissolved. So the French play up anti-communism to convince them they're in Algeria for the common good. The army took a beating in Indochina. It's about honor. This case is a godsend to them. It makes everyone uncomfortable. That's why the Party stayed away. We need important people to support him. - To tell his story. - She's right. You could be our Paris connection. We could shake up the press. L'Humanité, Libération... Let's involve them. We can rally the intellectuals. Organize a press conference in Paris. A demonstration. We couldn't see his wounds in court, but maybe... he could write about what happened, the torture. We must raise public awareness. The boss wants to see you. Now? Don't take this personally, Hélène. I like you very much. You're a good worker. But... I have a family too. Right. Of course. Hello. I brought this for Mr. Iveton. - What was the name? - Fernand Iveton. You wooed your wife with that voice? No, with my dance moves. How do I know she even exists? You have no wedding band. A friend of hers got his stuck in a factory machine. Lost three fingers. She never let me wear mine to work. Can I see? Come here. Spread your fingers. Like this. - Good article? - It's a start. Not as good as we hoped, but more are coming. There's nothing. There's nothing! Just a few lines. Wait, I have good news too. The lawyer Nordmann has a government contact. Mitterrand, the Justice Minister. Nordmann sent him Fernand's statement about the torture. He controls all executions. No one would oppose his pardon. President Coty validates all his decisions. We'll meet with him and ask for a pardon. And we'll get one. He didn't kill anyone. I know you'll fight, Hélène. How do you know? You say that as though I were great. As though I were brave. But you're wrong. You're wrong! Know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking what an idiot! What an idiot I was! I fell in love with that man, and I came here with my son. That's what I'm thinking to myself. I don't want to be here. There's nothing I can do. Nothing. Some 50 buildings in Algiers suffered damage. Firemen, rescue workers and volunteer doctors immediately began pulling victims from the rubble. There are 15 dead and at least as many injured. The ongoing investigation aims to uncover the causes of the explosion. Thus ends a particularly violent week, marred by a sharp rise in terrorism. Once again, tempers are flaring and residents of both communities are palpably anxious. Indeed, there is reason to fear more unrest in the coming days. Take care of yourself. I love you. Jean-Claude Are you ok? I'm ok. - Chicki. - Abdel Aziz. Any news? The Front called a general strike to pressure the UN. The cops and soldiers are furious. Paramilitary are everywhere. They came with General Massu. They've occupied the city, they're smashing everything. This is it. This is war. I know who you are. Think we're the same? How dare you look at me like that? Tell me this. Have you killed anyone? - Please. - Wait. I'm asking you. Have you killed or not? Even our women can kill. You act so proud. But what did you do? Did you fight? Everyone fights here. Everyone. You're no hero just for fighting. Do you understand what it means to kill? Do you? Mr. President. That reminds me of a time that was very hard, during the First World War. I saw a young officer get gunned down by a firing squad. He'd deserted. Just before he died, the general said to him, "You know, kid, "you're dying for France too." Stay back. I'm making you a sweater. What? A sweater. We'll fight. Everyone has to know. How do you feel? Tell me about you. I'm scared. You're so brave. So strong. I see your eyes. I see your eyes. I'm stroking your hair. I'm lifting your beautiful hair. I'm taking your arm, your little porcelain arm, and caressing it. I move to your hips. I feel your body on me. Your whole body on me. I take my hand and go all the way up your back. I lay my head on your shoulders. I kiss you on the mouth. My dear sweet Hélène, love of my life, we'll be together again soon. And if we're not, you can say it's all my fault. I'm a traitor. It's not a nice word to say. But I am, twice over. A traitor to France, that unjust, inhumane France. It makes me feels strong, alive. I know why, I feel why. But I'm also a traitor to you. I lied to protect you. You and your son. We only live once, you said. I risk losing you both. How can I do such a thing? I wanted to live with you in this free country. I love you so much. Forgive me for the pain I've caused you. Hélène, my love, let's be proud we fought. You did too, I know, I saw you. You fought with me. With the life you wanted. I hold you close to my heart. LONG LIVE FREE ALGERIA! Iveton! Long live Algeria! Long live Algeria! Long live Algeria! "Executed on this day were: "Lakhnèche, Mohamed Ben Ziane." Be brave. "Ouennouri, Mohamed Ben Khiar. "Iveton, Fernand." Coffee? Cigarette? "I'm sure Algeria will be liberated from its colonialists. Europeans and Muslims will be able to go on living equally." Fernand Iveton's last words Fernand is buried at Bologhine Cemetery in Algiers. Hélène Iveton died in 1998 and is buried in France with Fernand's portrait and his letters from Barberousse prison. Between 1954 and 1960, 198 convicts were executed in Algeria under President René Coty. 45 under François Mitterrand as Justice Minister. All were Algerians.
