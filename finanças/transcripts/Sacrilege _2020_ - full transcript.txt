Shit. Hey, is that you? You decent? Never. Oh thank you. You still up for Blake's place tonight, chick? Ok if I use your shower, Jill, Stace? Mi casa... You joining us? Give me one hour and I'll be good to go. I'll give you two, I know what you're like. Oh where is she? So night... Evening ladies... - Hey, Jimmy. - Hello, Jimmy. How are you? Yea, I'm really good thanks. So are you guys here to see Blake? We are. Alright, she's just out the back. Thank you! I would love for you to do my makeup. Something to try. Hey! - Hey! - Hey, gorgeous. So... Trish was in here earlier. What the hell does that cheating bitch want? She just asked when I was seeing you again. I said you would be here tonight. I don't know what she wants and if you want her gone, she's gone. You can't seriously want to see her. I don't know. Look what Satan dragged in. I'm just gonna hear what she has to say. It's just a hug. It's never just a hug. Blake said you wanted to see me. I wanted to see how you were holding up. Tyler. He got out earlier. What? I'm so sorry, I thought you knew. Is this one of your wind-ups, Trish? What? No. It's been all over the news today. The solicitor's letter. What the hell is he doing here? Whoa there chick. Let's get this man a freebie on me, shall we? Why don't you guys help Kay back to her seat? I'm gonna need another martini for Trish. What was that about? Tyler's free. The guy that got banged up for assaulting her? He put her in a fucking coma, Jimmy. You ok? I'm fine, everyone needs to ask if I'm ok. Ok? Just let's get away from this bullshit. Who's up for getting the band back together? What? We haven't gotten bank account emptying, random tattoo getting, memory losing silly in years. It's about time we did, so who's with me? Well aren't you working this weekend? Well fuck work! I haven't had a sick day in five years. It's about time I did. I'm in. Trish? What you actually want me to come? Well aside from you breaking my heart we all used to have a pretty good time didn't we? It would be like Brighton and Aelfricam. I thought we weren't supposed to mention Aelfricam. That was the one with the picture, wasn't it? Kay, you sure you want to do this? I miss us. You wanna know if I'll be ok, I'll be ok when we're getting silly again together. Ladies. Here's to the women in the stiletto shoes who make all the money and drink all the booze. Cheers. - Ahh! - Ahh, yes! Yes! - Yo bitches. - Yea! - Hi, there. - Take that for you. Thank you. I can't still believe you've got Sunny D! Only man in my life who hasn't let me down. Ok! Who's ready for a weekend they'll never forget? Yea! Bollocks... hey open the glove box and pass me the map book, will you? The map book? Well unless you've got a working satellite we're about to kick it old school. Blake? For emergencies! Pretty sure that's for like on board a boat emergency honey, not you know stranded on the side of the M4 emergency. Oh Blake, stop for him. Are you feeling alright? Strange dude thumbing in the middle of the nowhere and you of all people wanna pick him up. There's four of us and besides, remember when those guys stopped for us on the way to Glasgow? What's the worst that can happen? Oh you're a life saver. Hi, I'm Kayla... This is Blake, that's Stacey and Trish. Hi, Vinnie, nice to meet you all. You guys heading to the festival, Mabon? What? I just assumed that's where you guys are going because there's a whole lot of nothing in every other direction. Well we're staying at the Mabon Lodge, does that have something to do with it? Yes, it's their festival. It's this yearly pagan dancing thing where they... give offerings of wheat and wine to their pagan god, Mabon Sounds a bit weird to me. It is a bit weird, they paint themselves and dance around half naked but... they have the best weed and hoochie you've ever tried. Trust me. Well they're my kind of party! Mabon Lodge is a stone's throw away, I can show you guys if you like. We're not a bit of girly, I'm sure we can be able to find it ourselves if we want to go, thanks. Well thanks for the lift. Hopefully see you guys later. Nice antlers. There was supposed to be someone waiting with a front door key for us? How do we get through the gate? Thanks. Good chat. He was a creepie. I'm not getting any signal. I've got yours Blake. I've got some signal barely. Please tell me there's wifi. I have to have wifi. I don't care about wifi, cause look, there's a pool. I'll be in in a minute. Yep. kitchen's in there so your bedroom's up stairs. There's only three bedrooms. So... two of us have to share. Looks like that's the master as well. Blake and I will share. She doesn't snore like you do. Ok, that works. Hey... Look... I don't know what your game is... Kay doesn't need any of your shit this weekend. I get it... you're her oldest friend but... but I just wanna make her happy. As friends. And if after the weekend she doesn't want anything more to do with me then... then you'll never see me again. Yea, we'll see. Well hey babe, stop that it's supposed to be a fun weekend, remember? Tea or coffee? You know I'm a coffee person. Stace? Tea for me. Where's Blake? Ooh, never mind. What is she doing? See her. You guys are useless. Come with me. Come on! This way. What are we doing? Wait for it. Blake, I'm not sure we're supposed to be in here. Maybe this was the stuff Vinnie was talking about. Blake! I don't think anyone's going to miss it. They would lock the door if they were that concerned. For once I'm in agreement with Trish. Look, if anyone catches us we'll just pay for it. How is that? Oh fine, ok. Who took that photo of us naked? Me. I've actually still got the camera. Whoa! Group photo? Yes! Yes. Why can't you take a picture on a phone like a normal person? You know you got your phone right there. Alright, 3, 2, 1. Martha! Oh it's cute! Oh it's really nice. Maybe just keep it to yourself. I vote something new. Yea. Oh it's cute! Let me see. Oh it's lovely. Ohh. Alright, we need a refill. What the fuck, dude! You scared the holy shit outta me. What are you doing here? Just on my way to the festival... thought you guys might like to come. Could be fun. Why don't we guys party together? Wouldn't you rather just chill here? We've got all weekend for that, I wanna dance. Well I'm up for it. Alright. I promise you'll remember it for the rest of your lives. If I bust my heels Vinnie, you're paying for them. Pick your face up. What's this. Didn't I say? Didn't I say? Tonight we celebrate our offering to the goddess Mabon. Let her take our fears... and reward us with her blessing. For the coming seasons. Goddess Mabon... as is your tradition... as is the way... We afford you our offerings... so you may remove our fears... till the next solstice. Accept... with respect. and duty. When do we get to party? Very soon. Mark down your fear. It's just a bit of fun. Done. Who's next? And where's the hooch and the weed? All in good time. Ah what, what the fuck dude. Yea, that bit always gets me. Don't worry we don't have to do that. Now this is my favorite bit. That's what I'm talking about. Jesus. Potent? It's got a bit of a kick. Thank you very much. Music! Come on. Don't be shy. What are you doing? Let them roam baby. Dance like every bodies watchin! Stop, leave now. Why? Before the end of the ritual. You and your friends, you must go. Mrs. March. You should leave our guests... to enjoy the festivities. Yes, Father. A little less handsey, eh? Mrs. March is shall we say one of are more challenging parishioners. Please, enjoy yourselves. This is an evening of celebration, now you're here. Come on you two, let's no leave you out. Come on. No. Oh! So you say. We made it. Hurry... I'm so... Is it a biscuit? It is a biscuit. Oh that's no fair. Actually, you guys I'm gonna go for a quick dip. Anyone finds you joining me. You don't have your swimsuit. Who needs a swimsuit? You're crazy. It'll be lovely. Don't be long and catch your death. Alright? Bye. Peak a boo. I found you. How was the rabbit? Did you miss me? No where to run! It's time to die. Hello little rabbit. Oh it's me. Me, it's me. Where's Tyler? It's just a dream. You're alright. You get a good look, fucking pervs. Blake, Blake. Blake, Blake! Blake! Blake, Blake, Blake, what's happened? There was huge dog. No, no, no, no. There's no dog, there's no dog. Blake. - It was right there. - Look at me. Look at me. I promise you, I promise you. There's no dog, there's no dog. Ok? Come on, let's get you out. Come on, come on, look, come on. You're ok, let's get you out. You're alright, let's get you inside. Morning babe. Morning! Hi, Stace, woke up and she wasn't there. She slept with me. I got a bit freaked out last night. You alright? Yea, yea, I'm fine. So Stacey's in the shower, where's Trish? She went for a run. Typical Trish. You mean the brer balls exercise? Tea or coffee? Tea! Stace. You ok? What? What? You just screamed, what's wrong? I'm a... I'm just losing my marbles. Well you can't lose what you don't have. I'm making breakfast, are you coming? Uh yea. Are you sure you're ok? Yea... yea. Trish? What, what? What, what! There's nothing there babe. - Oh. - There's nothing there. I think we all need to lay off that weed. I think you're right. How about a cup of tea? Come on. Alright. - You alright? - Not really. I'm definitely seeing things. No, that happened to me too. I swear it's that stuff we smoked. Yea, no shit. Yea. I think you're right. C'mon let's get you cleaned up. I might... have been wrong about Trish. Just looking out for my friends. I know you are. Breakfast of champions. Oh no, I'll do that, you made the food. So what does everyone fancy doing today? I'm just gonna chill by the pool. I need to get some content for my page but then I'm all yours. Deal? Deal. Blake, what about you lovely? I'm all over that pool but... this time you know not naked and not being chased by large imaginary dogs. You finished yet? Oh! Where's Trish, babe? I think she went to make some lunch. Do you want some? I could go a sandwich. You need a hand? No. Naughty. I think I can handle a cheese and cucumber sandwich. I was the chef in our relationship, remember? Fair point. Your day is it? Hold on to the tap. I've got some purses in my bag. C'mon. First a hill finds. What? Perv. How are you doing Blee? I'm fine. You know it was never my intention... Look... I'm not saying I forgive you... for what you did. But I just... It's so good being with you again. What's up? Babe, do you know how long we've been in bed for? Not long enough? Let's go funny about this, we can pick this up later. Do you promise? Pinkie promise. No. No. Hello there. I hear you had a nice afternoon. Very funny. Where's Stace? Last I saw her she was down by the pool. Should we go get her? Stace? Stace! Where the hell is she? Greenhouse! Stacey? You back there? We're looking for our friend. The little one, have you seen her? Mr. Creepy Creeperson wasn't much help. She's not in there and she's not around the house. The only place we haven't checked is the forest clearing. I think it's worth a shot. Well you two go and I'll stay here in case she gets past you. And get the cocktails ready for your return! We should probably wrap up. Yea, fair point. Make sure to take torches too, it gets dark out here real quick. Ok. Stace! Stacey! Stace? Stacey! There's somebody watching us. What? Where? Behind that tree. Walk over there, keep doing what you're doing I'm gonna sneak around. Don't know what to say babe, doesn't look like she's here. I think we should head back. Why are you watching us? Sorry. I needed to be sure you were alone. Why? You are in grave danger. Have you been hallucinating, seeing the things you fear? What are you talking about? The ritual, the goddess, Mabon. You were the offering. Stay together. Your bond is what weakens her. Whatever she shows you... it's only as real as you believe it to be. Face your fears. She's coming for you. Find your friends. Babe! Really? Fucking funny. Is that you Vinnie, or the perv from last night? Ten Blake... You're getting crazier by the day. Now I'm talking to myself. Blake, did you find her? Guys? Blake? Babe, that woman is yanking our chain. Well then where are they? I just think there must be a reasonable explanation and not the ramblings of a crazy old woman. And Blake left her ban. Ok, fair point... Humor me here, let's call the police and report them missing that way when they come back we can apologize and chalk it all up to me having a funny five minutes. Ok? We can do that. Why don't you try the cells outside and I'll try the land line, that way one of us is bound to get through. No, she said we shouldn't split up. Well what's gonna happen, we're within 10 seconds of each other. I just don't think we should be apart. I won't take my eyes off of you. Ok. Come on. If you don't get any signal just come straight back. Emergency operator. Which service do you require? Yes, police, I want to report a missing person. Hello? I understand you want to report a missing person. Yes, two of my friends Hello? Can you repeat that please? Hello? Hello? Hello? He matches your problem. Hello, hello? Hello? Shit. No, no, no, hello? Shit. I'm not afraid. Trish! Trish? Trish! Trish, what's happened? Trish. I'm gonna get you out of here, ok? Alright, come on. That's it, up we go. Come on. We gotta get you to a hospital. You are not real. Shit. Fuck! Get the fuck out of my way! No. You're not real, you're not here! Take another step and I'll shoot. I swear to God. I am your God. Oh you're pathetic. You always were. You don't deserve someone like me. I should have just killed you when I had the chance. No one would have missed you... Not even your loser mother. No where to run little rabbit. It's time to die. A lot of spirit in you still. I'm not scared of you. You have no power over me... anymore. Fuck you bitch. Look at me. No, no. Destroyed. Just go. Are you ok? I love you. I love you too.
