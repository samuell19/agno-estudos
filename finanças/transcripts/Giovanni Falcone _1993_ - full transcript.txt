- Good day. - I need to speak to Peppuccio. - Here, then open it. - Thanks. Good compliment to you. But that it does? Let them pause for a bit. That, that one with the glasses! Now to the one with the mustaches. Now the oldest, come on. But who is it? I'm saved, give me! Didn't you expect him? - Do you know that I have a guard tomorrow? - Farewell freedom! ¡Giovanni, beware! Since you're on duty tomorrow, try to be on time. It is the last night of freedom. - Nine? - The copier broke. You know you're right? I discover the checks and these they have already been credited to the accounts of my two defendants. I found that process from Pablo in my trunk. That? His is yours, the trunk is mine. We have to dig in and find out what the heck are getting more and more connected. Yes, but if the copier doesn't work? - I salute Chinnici. - It's okay, take care. - Annoying? - Giovanni, come on, come on! I'm sorry. How was New York for you? What did Tomas Cash tell you? Says the big traders made a big jump on bonds ... Now the banks are buying. We are fortunate that you are happy to use them. - That's it - Giovanni His Excellency Pizzillo sent for me - Yes - And do you know what he told me? You're in the education office ruining Palermo's economy. All these surveys on banks and their finances ... - You have to finish it! - Impossible, everything has already started. We'll talk again, while Falcone pauses. You have to upload some processes, but many, many! Because here we risk leaving them about pots that should not be discarded ... It's not that other magistrates don't, they do, - But in unacceptable times. - Excuse me, Pizzillo, These pots are between businessmen, masons and mafia? Came out in the open But what did he do when you called him Freemasonry? As if a tarantula had bitten him! This time the funeral was not crowded - But we took a cut. - Except ... and then? They stopped the car, made the sign of the cross and I ... What do you say? I'm worse than eels, they go anywhere! Who protects them? Nineteen, but this is not Toto Inzerillo? Is here... Here it is! A moment of silence We must be very cautious today among us is Ruffini. Starting tomorrow we will have to count on our friends to support him. You've been firing for a year. Are you going to the funeral? Soon we will find Inzerillo having an aperitif with us ... - Stay, have a coffee. - Can not. Oh, no... - See you - Call me. The documents don't say, but he had 4 million. I found this, it is written: "Castronuovo". You say it's him? He is not Castronuovo, I questioned him last year, he will be about 60 years old. Anyway, try to track it down! Look, I also found this. I never spoke about it, it is a construction society and the administrator is an engineer, a clean, using it as a screen. He married a cousin. - Track Lo Presti's phone. - Obviously. - Hello? - A call from Brazil. - Ready, Mrs. Lo Presti? - Yes - Good evening, is your husband there? - With whom I speak? - Robert. - Roberto who? - May I have a request? - Tell me. Tell him to call me this time tomorrow ... Roberto. This Roberto calls continuously from Brazil. - But don't you know who he is? - It's a mystery. - Good evening, Mr. Roberto. - How are you? - Am I okay, thank you, darling? - Well well. But ... life ... Life is a tremendous thing, Mr. Roberto. - I know. - We're going crazy here. The cruellest thing in this world is that there is no return. - Yes ... - Tell me something. - Can I speak to my brother? - We don't know if it is? Nor where is it? Ah, don't you know? Holy, I haven't seen him for 20 days. And I don't know if I'll see it Holy ... You don't know who to trust. - Pablo. - Giovanni, dime. Can you verify if one of the Inzerillo brothers is called Santo? Let's see. - José, Pedro, Thomas ... - Tommaso. - Holy, there it is! - Holy - Happy? - Thanks. Ah, the new copier arrived If they just forgot to send us the card! - It's normal, right? - See ya. Nineveh, this devout demon appears right after the death of ... Inzerillo ... can't be his brother ... - With Nino? - Nino told me ... Disconnection. - Who do you think Nino is? - Giovanni, it's Nino Salvo. The Inzerillo family was massacred ... and Nino Salvo, vice king of Sicily, is worried. Why? And why does Roberto want to return from Brazil? Underground. Let's put Zucchetto on Nino Salvo's ribs. - Seven were killed today. - We are in war. Now I have to go. - Bye, Giovanni. - One is from the Badalamenti family. He didn't go on a cruise, he was on the run ... - Was your cousin Ignacio there? - No, I was alone. I knew two things, one missed the wedding of Nino Salvo's daughter, everything was ready, with gifts, chocolates, guests ... then he was seen with his cousin Ignatius in a secret location. Salemi. He's wanted, but he's hiding ... thank goodness it's a secret ... Time Edition! Nino Salvo's brother-in-law! Stop, stop! But who broke the news? News! They kidnapped Nino Salvo's brother-in-law! Engineer Prettier may have been assassinated! Come down and bring one. See if there is any comment on the controversy of The Church. - Yes, another dead end. - Here it is. General La Iglesia flies from Palermo to Rome to confer anti-mafia powers on the minister. But will this prefect help us? Severed head, decapitated family. The Inzerilla are massacred 21 and Badalamenti 11. The Bontade decimated ... a carnage I've never seen before. Here's the file, this Es Marchese, Bontade's disciple. Do you understand why Salvo escapes? According to Primaluce and Salvo they are waiting for someone from Brazil to come ... - Let's put a rhythm on it. - Primaluce? Yes, an informant ... Roberto, prepare the car. Captain, what do you say? For political crimes we go in the dark. - Annoying? - We missed him! Good Morning. I see the maps go ahead, I'd like to take a look Again, maybe. Good work, good morning. Giovanni. And that... A doctor, the less we talk about it, the better it will be. Where do we stay? - Political crimes. Chinnici has no peace because the file has disappeared of the meeting between Piersanti, Mattarella and the minister, in Rome. But let's get back to us. We know that this informant, Primaluce, he found out that Salvo wants to come from Brazil a piece of the band, a certain Roberto. Who is this Roberto? Think about it. 200 lire a bundle of chard. A 500 zucchini! They saw who I am! Scarpuzzedda and Prestifilippo. Quick, go on! Go Go! I would eat their liver. Today everything goes wrong! Primaluce doesn't know anything about Roberto, these are out of our hands! What do we do now with Falcone? But what have you got? It is that they have seen me, when I was serving in the area, They were already frantic, I talked to you with Prestifilippo's grandfather, Scarpuzzedda's cousin. - I'm a dead man. - Nothing will happen to you. If we only take one. Let's go! - Then we'll see you on Friday. - Agree. ... And while the son was standing running from the balcony! But think a bit! By the way, didn't you see that person anymore? - No, she saw it for the last time. - And where? Where are you going The resemblance is impressive. Yes of the identikit parece Prestifilippo. We did it with the help of the marshal who was there by chance and saw a young man go by on a motorcycle ... Yes, but don't tell me that she, or killers like these, it was the hands that took the papers from the general's safe. - Is there someone to support you? - Ninni ... We can't understand who was the first to enter the general's house. - Who took the key? Maybe the two agents they were looking for the sheets to cover the dead We don't even know the names! It is true that in the safe, there was only one empty box ... - The service report. - I can see? - Of course! - A little laconic. - I had it rewritten. Get ready! And then a red Renault was seen escape from where they burned commando cars - Don't you have a red Renault? - There are so many in Palermo! But what are you saying? If you give me a little time, I have a few things on my hands ... A track Let it go, let it go Bastards, bastards! We are going now... File 721, okay? Let's talk to Giovanni, there are great news. I'm waiting for phone calls, I'll call you later. Agree Oh my gosh, if we don't end the mob cancer will end up killing us ... I open the window! Yes, but I would not like a mob with strange ideas. Of course, here is the antimafia flourish. - Sit down, let's go. - We said that ... for the attack on the church general Experts say they used two kalashniKovs, Well, one had already been used ... although they are not the same For the damage, here please, to Contino jewelry. If this weapon had never been used, They will want to test it in armored transports. Yes nothing is missing in the jewelry. Yes, always with the same weapon, which is this, They killed the first, Inzerillo, in the church. Incidentally, the new Alpha arrived, more armored. Then following the same scheme, they killed Ferlito, Bontade was probably killed too. The other kalashniKov, is here, probably used in the murder of Ferlito. What in essence, both the kalashniKov used with De La Iglesia, They were used against Ferlito and one of them killed Bontade, Inzerilla in a short time and with the same scheme. In summary... Different movements equal arms and without senders. If the senders are the same, it is as if each process is ... as the backbone of a single great process. Sorry so the next job should be a joint job. - Yes. - A good step forward. You know i was thinking of something Why does the winning mob even kill the wife of The Church? What are they doing? Killing a woman, violating a code for the first time. Or maybe because she knew all his secrets In these terms, nothing to say. Giovanni, I have something else to tell you ... If you mean the third level, I also agree on that. Sorry, but I do not agree to speak this in public. We take risks and they are perfect at misleading us. In your opinion, I must pretend to believe ... That Mattarella, The Church, The Tower Did they just bother the mob? Yes, excellent corpses meet excellent leaders. I salute you Waiting. Close the door Listen Giovanni, it's days and days that I wonder ... Why do you keep the court records at home, in copy and in original? Why do you meet with magistrates, and police in strict reserve ...? See it's simple, I don't trust anyone And regarding encounters, I would also meet the devil. if it was useful for my work ... Let's say that intelligence is sometimes more flexible than necessary. - Good evening. - Good evening. You look tired, go and rest. "There is a red thread that links the great crimes, a single political project ". If only they did it by returning the body, I would have a reason. I would have buried him in the family grave. I would bring her flowers on Sundays with the girls. But who knows what they did to him. My husband was an engineer. He built lots of houses. "Palermo Due" Did you see it? It is a kind of city. Now I say, without the help of his cousins ​​Salvo and his friends, Would he have built this residential city? Madam, who were these men? that allowed Salvo ... let's say friends, in fact ... what allowed these businesses? I don't know I can only tell you ... that Roberto, who always used to call from Brazil, y Tommaso Buscetta. The head of the two worlds. It came a moment ago, it is not the usual handwriting. They warn us that an attack on a judge is being prepared. This time there is talk of a remote control pumper. Don't say anything to the others, only the two of us will know. If you share the same, I'd be careful ... You're not, wait ... Two in a single shot would be too much, let's go and get going ... I recommend it with Chinese. Fight for his extradition. Doctor, there is the honorable Lima. Judge, I'm sorry to say, but here ... in the office of instruction, you work less and less for justice. And more and more against Christian democracy Do you know what machine could be used for a fire engine? I don't know, it depends on how much explosive is placed. Confirms that he was in Zurich from April 2 to 24, 1982 That the payment for the drugs took place in Switzerland? What about those photos, Colonel? And much of the money came from Sicilians These two, do you know them? Yes, They are. We stay in the Mercedes. I'm sure those dollars ... came from the Banca di Lugano. Why are you sure? Why the bundles of dollars were ... kept within the bands of the bank of Lugano. - Is this Roberto? - It's not Roberto, that I said! There is no doubt that this investigation is revolving with the prefect ... Say it - Doctor, what is it? - Chinnici, there was an attack. - Phone the lawyer. - Yes. They killed Rocco, a bomb! What are you saying, it's not possible! They killed Rocco, a bomb! In the massacre, Magistrate Rocco Chinnici lost their lives, two carabinieri and the doorman of the house where the judge lived. Anger, disdain, protest. Palermo rebels against this logic of terror. Citizens lay flowers at the scene of the attack, in homage to the magistrate who always fought against the mafia. But there is something about this that was never accurate ... The transport, how was it done? Next! With Sicilian ships? - I do not know. - Telex from Italy. A telex But what do you say? Nobody sent you anything here! In fact, we didn't know whether or not to warn you about this ... one thing that's so scary ... we didn't want to bother you. Why, what happened? They killed Rocco, a massacre. - Who are you? - I am the death. Sr. Falcone Sr. Falcone Giovanni, it's you! What a horrible thing! I can not believe it... Francesca, but what is my job? Do you understand that it is inhuman? How can we come to conceive it ...? The first impulse is to leave, with what they did to Rocco, also dead ... but I can't do it because I got a telex. Very strange, I mean, no one has asked for it. It was written to return to Palermo with the first flight, but I spoke with Paolo and he tells me not to move, - That could be a trap. - Don't come, Giovanni. Do it for the memory of Rocco, don't come ... Stay here, counselor. Since Chinnici's death, no one came here ... - Would you let me? - Please I must take some things. - Excuse me, I haven't introduced myself. - I know who is. She took my father's place. Why did you ask him to come? Are you not afraid of dying in Palermo? You see, at 63, you have to get used to the idea of ​​death. With the death of Rocco ... you will have understood from the phone calls ... we are blocked ... Nino. I would like to tell you something. In the Palace of Justice I can trust a few friends, and I also say this for you, we can only count on a few friends. When they know what I have in mind, those few friends will be less. Caponnetto wants to make an anti-mafia group. - Yes, Caselli, Calogero. - Just like during the terrorism! But in your opinion, Chinnici, what was he doing? Now your favorite from Rome ... Was he a bastard? If I told you that U'Dottore had been removed from the service, - That was great news! - Hey, what a pleasure! - Come into the office. - What others say? Finally, it was about time, we will only deal with the mafia! It is difficult to kill everyone, if they kill you as long as ... No, the first one they kill is him. They have formed a new working group This will end the isolation of the judges ... - Did you know this? - That! The Chinnici bombing could have been prevented ... a police informant took records of a Lebanese, who warned of a car bomb. Now, he is your informant, call him and question him ... Did someone turn it off? you say they are two of Michele Greco, fine. Then stop them and put it under the press. But what did they do? Any! You got it? Any! No, with that "nothing" they did a lot, but in another direction. Meanwhile, they let you know only the usual. A direct gift to the vineyards, and go underground. Regardless, Rocco's death is another reason to continue. Yes? Agree. It's Gerace, ready to go. Go? - Brasil - ¡Buscetta! Buscetta, she is willing to talk to Italian judges But ... a whole night won't be enough, Dr. Falcone. I think he understands my respect and consideration that I have for them ... If I have to be honest, I do not feel this respect, but do you know how they arrested him? They spoke of the corpse of the girl found buried in the garden, drugged and with a shotgun to the back of the neck? I know, but the considerations have to be made by others. He is willing to talk, the mob knows everything about us, even that we are here. And what do we know? This is a turning point! I warn you, Judge, I am speaking ... and it will make him a celebrity, but they will try to destroy him, professionally and physically. Do not forget that the account that she has opened with our cousin, can close only one way. With death. The mafia war, therefore, was Corleone's war, Directed by Toto Rina. Since Liggio's arrest ... who else could stop him? This bloody traitor! And the traditional mobster, like me, Bontade and Badalamenti, those who opposed the death of politicians, magistrates, carabinieri ... Bontade was used to solving problems using all the contacts he had, in all fields. And he had, Dr. Falcone, he had. If I say that Sindona's secrets were not plucked, compared to Bontade's, do you understand me? So this morning we started ugly. Who is the head of the Palermo dome? Michele Greco, Ciaculli family, said the pope. Explícame one thing, Michele Greco, alone, Can you order the murder of a magistrate like Chinnici? Murder cannot be done without the consent of the family and the territory where it must be executed, but ... for the most serious bloodshed the dome gathers ... The entire dome decides. There is an unwritten, but absolute rule of our brotherhood. The decisions of the top leadership must be carried out at all costs. - It's worth dying for. - You're saying that ... the activity of Cosa Nostra in Sicily, Italy, worldwide, Is it enforced by your own leaders? Is this what you are saying? Yes. So, Cosa Nostra is a radically top-down organization ... - Ah. - If I can, I say it. Tomorrow instead of saying "ah" say "bah" This Buscetta made a great gift We didn't even know for sure that the mob was called Cosa Nostra. At the base of the organization is the family, in which men of honor and soldiers stand out. Above the family is La Cúpula, presided over by a chief. But political crimes. The Tower, Mattarella, Of The Church, Is it possible that the mafia does not foresee some reaction from the state? For the most serious crimes the Dome assesses the pros and cons. Sure, but we mean ... With the assassination of General De La Iglesia, the state is forced to apply the Law of La Torre. In this law there is an article, 416 bis, That doesn't apply and it's a ride for the mob. The general had defied Cosa Nostra. For charity, the General had his hands tied! If the mob were to kill all the people who challenge it with words, this country would be a cemetery. Buscetta, I'm interested in understanding what the qualifications are what the leadership does, when deciding a crime like that of General De La Iglesia. Let's say there could be a ... convergence of interests Between whom? Let's just say the general wasn't that cumbersome ... just for Cosa Nostra. Who were those politicians, or which politician? Or for what politician was the general cumbersome? Don't you know or don't want to say it? - Badalamenti didn't tell me. - With the report you had? Buscetta, don't talk nonsense! I don't like how it works, because he says, doesn't say, talks and doesn't speak! Do you know the names of these politicians? Do you know them yes or no? Then tell them! To the President of the Council, to the Minister of Foreign Relations. These names should do it, otherwise the third level remains poor Chinnici's invention. I'm not interested in working this way, I'm leaving! No, Dr. Falcone, stop. Kick back and relax Please. I am not talking about politics and I told him so from the first moment. The conditions are not given and then even if I say the names ... Say the name of the mole on the mobile Who, a friend of friends, A Dottore. Pásame with Falcone. In how long will you finish with those mandates? I'm busy! Nino keep calm Tell him 366 commands are not done in 5 minutes - Is that Badalamenti? - Yes. Flyer 5 to Via Aureto, the 6 sends it to Via Maqueda. Everything under control, for 8 hours nobody can leave Palermo - That is all? - Milan and Frosinone, it's okay. - Rome - In Rome, they took four. If it was Rocco, I wonder how happy he would be. I was just thinking the same thing. - Guess how many arrested? - 150! We made it 150, Giovanni! Ignatius and Nino Salvo are men of honor in the Salemi family. And as such they were introduced to me by Stefano Bontade, when I came to Palermo in 1980. It turns out that they have a relationship run by many MPs. - Who is it? - I reserve to give the names. But with Nino I could see even in Rome. I remember that time at Pippo Caló's house ... there Nino tells me that a parliamentarian he hadn't seen for a long time He wanted to meet me. - Who was the MP? - I do not remember. How can you not remember? Buscetta, then ... If you had to see him again, it means you knew him. Why don't you want to tell me? Sir judge Okay, let's get back to Salvo. Then Nino Salvo hosted us in his villa facing the sea. What a wonderful place. We were so peaceful, so happy that we hardly believed it ... The New Year's dinner was brought from the nearby Zagarella hotel, property of Salvo ... At Zagarella, we felt at home. Meetings, banquets ... This is where Scarpuzzedda cut off the arm of Toto Inzerillo's son, who said he would avenge his father. Buscetta, think about it for a moment. Ciancimino is no longer the mayor of Palermo, even the Christian Democrats have distanced themselves from him ... Even Lima ... Me and Ciancimino knew what everyone knew. Then one day it was Pippo Caló, I was invited to his house and he spoke. Open your ears wide. For the revitalization of Palermo they have allocated 1,000 million. - 1,000 million? - Yes, 1,000 million in contracts. Wait, not only they wait. And with Ciancimino in hand we take them. We're screwed, they're all gathered in Mobile. Don Vito open, it's me! Wake up, please! What's the matter? It is not possible, it is not possible! Oh God ... I feel bad. I can't go, I feel bad! Are you Salvo Antonino, aka Nino? Look how far they have come! Yes, it's me! - Harmful, harmful! - Please please! I see the headlines, they raped the mob sanctuaries ... Ciancimino, you must make an effort and try not to feel bad. The proceedings against him, from four to ten. What can you tell us about 2,500 construction licenses issued, while he was mayor of Palermo, in large part, front men. By the way, how do you justify the demolition of Villa Deliella, and that of other buildings of freedom, where in its place there is only a mass of concrete? I didn't know the restrictions were there. I, as the mayor of Palermo, deny it. I've just been a good manager. I have created work for thousands of people. I'll show you one thing. This is a photocopy of a check signed by you emitido to Michele Pozza. Italian-Canadian mobster, murdered in front of a pizzeria in Montreal. Me, I feel bad please talk to the ... lawyer. Call a doctor, I feel bad. Mr. Salvo, how can you explain the fact that you ... and his cousin were allies of two enemy families, - During the mafia war? - This is not our thing! You are still alive and more respected than before. On the one hand, Bontade, Inzerillo and Buscetta. On the other, the Greeks of Ciaculli, allied with the winners of the Corleones. And you in the middle. These Greeks, perhaps, in some hunting party we have found it, or maybe at some party, I don't remember ... See, these checks that were circulating, they would say otherwise. Because, they explain the amounts contributed in the relationships, very specific ... A check for 300 million from 12/19/1980, 386 million from 02/01/1982. This one of 400 million dated 03/03/1983, signed by Andrea Notaro, brother-in-law of Michele Greco. Please lawyer Well ... I honestly don't remember, maybe it was a loan He's laughing at me, because first he told us, that he barely knew the Greeks, then he did not know if he knew them then gives him a billion loans that were never returned to the institution. Tommaso Buscetta, I have never seen him, I did not know him ... I always reproached my cousin for giving him hospitality when he was on the run This is an infamous setup to discredit the Salvo family. And that, because we are militants of the Christian Democracy ... The left under the guise of the mafia it has always tried to hit the Christian Democrats. When Andreotti arrived in Sicily, we were happy to do our duty To accompany him, him and Lima. Because they are not Italian, they are not Sicilian, and they did what they did for our island What they did they will have done for you. It's no coincidence that DC had the power to award you a contract to the municipal councils of Sicily, with double profit than in the rest of Italy. You can talk You must know sir that while he was in Rome, they killed a few relatives. People who had nothing to do with this. Working people... People who were neither from Cosa Nostra nor from anything. They killed them like that, to make me feel afraid, so I said to myself, I want to kill this Pippo Caló. Why him? First, because he said that Bontade wanted to kill Toto Riina. And this yes, which is cowardly and bloody, have an excuse to kill Bontades. Now I want to avenge him but it has to be a signal for the Corleones We massacre him my friends and I ... Can you describe this Riina? I can tell he's shorter than me, a round face like an eggplant. When I saw him he was still greasy, now he is with straight hair ... - This photo here, what can you say? - But with this when you find it? If Zucchetto were alive, you'd have good photos ... Lullaby. Roberto. What are you doing here, not on vacation? Look, I'm leaving you right now? I heard about Montana, what should I do? For now we only find this animal - Let's stay tuned. Ten years will not be enough to see one like Beppe Montana. I came as was, the suitcase will be sent to me. Are you hungry? Let's eat something at my place. Laura. - Finally, is there any news? - No, nothing new. - Something to eat? - Are you safe? - Yes, I'm going, do you have Antioquia? - Well, how long do they come in? We will arrive in a few minutes. Now I put the baby to bed. - Check our arrival through the curtain. - Yes. Chao. Say, okay. Now comes the dad. There is! Here is dad! Ninni ... Ninni! Don't cry, nothing happens. Help! Help! Open, please! Open! Help help! Open up, please! Please, open! Help help! Do it for the girl! Oh God! Have the little girl, take her home. Please please! Ninni ... Ninni! Lullaby! Look at me, Ninni, speak, tell me anything! Ninni! I'm Laura, Ninni! Please! ¡No! - What's going on? - Came out of jail, they prepare another attack ... How did they know that he dined at home? He didn't do it for days. It's a case of wiretapping ... "Hay un topo" Only one? They are killing our best collaborators We are digging the hole. There is a strategy, Paolo. Here they come! Welcome Lucia, where are you going? Waiting! Lucy! Lucia, stop! Please wait! Lucia, Lucia ... Dad, you knew it was my first party We had to run like thieves. This place sucks. Yes, Lucia, I know what you feel. But if something happens to me or Giovanni ... You know, we came here to finish our work. I promise you that when we return we will take up everything ... Yes, with the guards behind! Lucia, what is it? Paolo ... What is it? Giovanni, why are you asking us to make this sacrifice? Why are they deporting us so they can finish our work? This way we won't be able to finish it anymore! Meanwhile, Riina, Santapaolo el Provenzano ,. they continue to do what they want. Tell me why a character like Riina Does your wife give birth to the best clinic in Palermo? But people like Marchese, Madonia and Caló are in jail! It seems like a miracle. No, the miracle is happening ... It's hot in here! - Take a handkerchief. - Let's go! Have you read this, excuse me? Almost almost between the mafia and politics. No contacts! - Do not exaggerate. - But how, does it not make you angry? Excuse me, we have documented, the level of complicity between the mafia and politics ... And did you see what they wrote? Here it is. Sporadic and occasional What do we do, are we going to have a dispute with the prosecutor, a moment before entering the room? - And the? - And the... - Here's Geraci. - Let's see what it tells us. You are here ... Paolo, have you forgotten? You're right, let's go right away. Is the political side of the mob what made you angry? No, Vincenzo. We have been reasonable, you have to accept it. We had separated the political crimes. The whole story of Michele Sindona with the secret services, Freemasonry, the Knights of Catania, the P2 Lodge ... We have barely touched it! And the aspects that we leave in the shadow of the crimes of the Church? At some point, your prosecution has to sue us. If it were up to me, I wish. The complicity between the mafia and politics, just as you say, the number of secret links, he's great ... but he's the boss ... He wins, let's talk about it. The door A snitch Packed theater Listen, Geraci will convince the boss that everything is fine ... And how? - Continuity ... - Continuity! - Yes! Continuity between the mafia and politics to the point of complicity ... No, no ... it is going well, for now it is going well ... For the things that happened this year, for the word complicity ... it's worth everything! A Rome? This process with 476 accused of gangster crimes, a historical fact that is unprecedented, It will take place in the vicinity of the Ucciardone prison, in a bunker room with concrete walls and armored doors. Rigidly guarded by 3000 agents who will be in the area. On the one hand, the holy mothers, who have been terrified for decades in Sicily. On the other, a double jury. Effective members and a reserve jury in case there were desertions. The examining judges, they will add tremendous unexplored secrets, especially in the sense of the political crimes of Reina, Mattarella and La Torre. Another black hole, the links between the Masons and the records. Contributions that passed through Pippo Caló, regarded as the cashier of the mafia. Buscetta, you want to ruin me! What evidence do you have? Why don't you give the names? No, you have to give the names yourself. Mr President, I want to make a public statement ... In the spring of 1970 Buscetta came to make me a proposal, because he was interested in a coup in Italy. A military coup. I told him not to be interested And why did they visit you, Buscetta and the Greek Salvador Scicchiteddu? The Americans were directly interested Buscetta was part of the secret services! He was the confidant of the secret services. Hello Antonino. It's me, Falcone, do you remember? Do you remember me? Help me! Help! Back in '77, Bontade and his brother-in-law were well-known Freemasons. They wanted to create a special lodge ... reserved for large mafia pieces. We had to go in ... My brother used to say that the lodge was a cover, ideal for gangsters, magistrates, businessmen and politicians ... who would like to exchange favors. Favors? What kind of favors? Your Honor, what are you doing, 'Do you want to bribe me? Just ask about the power of the mob. The power of money A great mass! That the mafia moves all over the world and that it can lend practically at a rate ... say, cut in half. Yes, the financial power! Or is there something else? Your Honor, most importantly, The Power of Impunity. Nino, Calderone is walking like a train. I believe that for the third level, we will let you see the green lines, - we just have to nail the Costanzo case, - with the association of the mafia boss. With 416 bis? Is not easy I know, I need an idea. All these times, we are making ideas come ... It's cold tonight Do you know who summoned me to his office today? Someone who is surely against our policy ... Exactly, only with the summary secret, I could not comment on anything. What's the matter? What's that? Nino, what is it? Nothing, nothing, this Calderone is making us all jog! I'll get you a glass of water. On behalf of the Italian people, the Assassination Court of Palermo, First section condemns Lucchese Giuseppe, Montalto Salvatore, Spadaro Francesco and Sinagra Antonio to life imprisonment and a 10 million fine each. Also sentenced for life and 200 million lire in fine ... Blow to the cupola of Cosa nostra, The judges believed Buscetta. This morning in the bunker room of the Ucciardone, the Palermo Murder Court has issued against the mafia, a sentence, which is undoubtedly going to be defined as historical. Finally the state has given a precise answer ... Francesca, have you seen it? - The TV is exultant! Luckily you are the one who says that the mafia is stronger than before ... Yes, but I would like to know what you think. Giovanni, just look at those faces in the cages. Who can believe that those who are there, are the perpetrators of major crimes? At least the past doesn't bite. Lee. You embody the deployment in your favor, stop, contact as soon as possible. He doesn't say take Caponnetto's place easy! - Say - Meli, is that you? What time is it? What's the matter? Listen to me well, there is not a moment to lose You must submit the petition for counselor, and withdraw the one you made for the presidency of the court. But what do you say? I gave my life to get there. Meli you know, I do not speak only in my name. You're the only one in Palermo who can block Falcone's entrance. In Falcone? I bet you don't put down those briefcases even to take a shower. Anyway I think Geraci will give us his support. I have prepared a list with some names, the insurances are written, the others in pencil ... A favorable list ... Hello Dad Hurry we miss the vaporetto. Are you coming, Giovanni? - Maybe - Come on, come on! Can not - More or less it seems ... - Yes, I don't want to delay! - Are you coming to Favignana? - I have to be in Palermo. You have to have courage to have children. I don't have them, I always hear that sooner or later they will kill me. Here in Marsala there was a guy, a certain Cordaro, but much younger than us ... One day he slipped, hit his head and died. Sooner or later we all have to die. - Why are you transferring it? - You know that very well. Yes, you tell me about your daughter, who has problems ... The fight in Trapanese that no one has ever had, That we need to decentralize the group ... The truth is, I'm not the one who never wanted to say it. That was why I couldn't stand your character. - You are very cautious! - Dad! And then two dicks in one chicken ... Bye. Falcone was the best of us all. I was privileged to work together, when the streets of Palermo were clogged with the dead. Giovanni Falcone wrote pages of civil redemption in the history book, not only of the Court of our country. - Falcone has. - Habemus Falconem. Falcone's exceptional talents, esteem and our personal relationship, they push me to prefer it in the election, if not hindered by the personality of your competitor, Antonino Meli. He is 16 years older than Falcone and was deported from a concentration camp in Germany. surviving unspeakable situations. I propose the appointment of Antonino Meli. I wonder how we can explain to the country that Giovanni Falcone with so many merits, I am not able to direct the Office of Instruction. If I remember correctly, when it came to the choice of Borselino for the Marsala Procuratorate, contrary to the criterion of seniority, Geraci, he just said it was about giving a sign, to fight thoroughly against the mafia. Now I ask why now, can he not choose Falcone? Falcone obtained 10 votes, Meli 14, with decisive abstentions. Falcone, a commentary. I do not comment, I continue working as usual. Nino Salvo and I were waiting for Mr. Lima in the commercial office of the company, and when he entered, We salute him with the respect he deserves. We were excited because we knew the weight of his fame politics, close to men of honor. Let's get to the bottom of the matter ... He had to be transferred to Catania as Deputy Director. Calderone, he had just turned against us, My brother, as a family leader, was under pressure. What did Lima say? He promised to intervene in his ministry ... The famous parliamentarian was seen in Rome with Nino Salvo, The Parliamentary Assembly was then reserved for appointments ... Was that true, Mr. Lima? I will talk about the contributions of the political mafia, only when the times ... are right. Stop being the champion of the state ... It's not your job! It's my job Buscetta, this is ridiculous! Dr. Falcone, you should thank me! - And you insult me? - For pleasure! Didn't you get it? If you are still alive here, It is due to the fact that I do not tell the whole truth that I know ... - Good Morning. - Did you cut your beard? Yes, that's enough of the cliché of Communist judge! - Doctor, it's okay. - Thanks. - Giovanni, what is that? - What thing? - Is it a crash or a reunion? - What do you say? Now let's go to the 1817 process. I point out, Caponnetto, before leaving, assigned us the group. It seems understandable because in the 1817 process all lines of investigation were left unfinished ... and now there is the Calderone process ... Dear Falcone, let's talk quickly ... Here I am and it is no coincidence at all! Dear Mr. Councilor, the group does not only respond to criteria of investigative efficiency, but also the need for protection ... Finally he came back. and personal security of magistrates ... It turned out he was unmasked. We were assigned process 1817. Christ! And all the processes of Cosa Nostra? And I'm not done, decided to assign us to the group, ordinary processes ... little processes ... And to foreign judges, mafia trials because it says that we should all know how to do everything. - It took us like 10 years! - Sorry... Even if we wrote him more than twenty it would not make sense, We must not make war on him. We have to come to an agreement. - Giovanni, I don't agree. - If we succeed ... It is an idea, I make a hypothesis to have a delegate for the 1817 process, maybe we can out there, remove the obstacle. Okay for me. As long as we have to deal with processes, we will not have time! And even if we got rid of the job, he would be the last to decide ... I will not only send them back, but I will raise a conflict of jurisdiction, for what we will think about the Cassation, if things work autonomously or connected, some manager from the so-called cupola, like your pontificate Buscetta ... The performances have been sent back to me for the second time ... He doesn't even open them. Giovanni, what should I do? He knows what to do because he has already raised in cassation, a resource of competencies ... Yes and there the first one that is waiting for him is the one of the section chaired by the ... Giovanni, they hooked us right The Swiss judges are on their way. - Welcome - Thank you very much Please, over here. You are alone? You know how the Swiss are ... Immediately to work. They will leave tomorrow. - Do you want us to take a bath? - It's not the day. - What's going on? - Here. The last of the raven. The chief of police and the leadership of the Criminal Police, allow a repentant to come to Sicily from the United States to rescue Corleone's enemies ... This to favor the capture of Toto Riina. In the success of the operation, Falcone was interested when discussing his appointment as Deputy Attorney General of Palermo. But this is outrageous! The purpose for discrediting you and the group is so clear! 40,000 anti-mafia letters have arrived ... and no one has ever talked about it. Those of the crow, go directly to the cover. I want to know who is behind it! ¡Doctor Falcone! What's the matter? It is an oblivion, or worse ... Do not touch anything, Alert the central! Tell him there's a suspicious bag, maybe it's some artifact. ¿Central? It's a weapon! - A bomb. - But how did it happen? How did those things get there? Explain to me! - How many? - Four. And nobody has seen anything? But what the hell are they looking at! Code 15, emergency, we converge on the Taura. No ships were found in the north zone, pass. Controlled western zone in Taura. Nothing to point out. Short. - I was waiting for her, she was in the air. - And when did they put it on? There is always vigilance ... Among the rocks, even at night. Who put that bomb knew that at this moment it would be, bathing with my Swiss colleagues. A mouse! What do the Swiss do? They came to Palermo to ask me some information and verify certain investigations. Francesca, in recycling money, in Swiss banks, There are not only billions of mafia and white collar robbers, there is something that goes further and it is about our political system. Something new that they have discovered. That is to say? Giovanni, what is behind them? - Doctor! - What's going on? Dr. Falcone! It's full of explosives! It would have been a massacre! Take a look at nearby villas and identify potential witnesses ... - Hello? - Judge Falcone. Good evening, President. It's Andreotti I just found out, it's terrible. It doesn't even seem true. But thank goodness it wasn't a disaster. I'm very happy. You know how much we esteem you and how much we appreciate your work. Wait, here's Vitalone. He also wants to congratulate you. Dear Falcone, fortunate men are seen in misfortunes. - It is not like this? - I don't know if you can talk about fortune ... He's talking to Falcone, he had an attack ... What kind of attack? - Do you want to say something and come to Rome? - Is it okay tomorrow? Alright, see you tomorrow at my office Okay, thank you. - Now I'm blowing up the queen. - I didn't notice. - Mia. - What's the matter? I see something terrible The knight is here and plays chess. I see it too, I don't see what is terrible. - Don't you see who he's playing with? - With who? With death. It's up to you, Antonius Block. You lost interest in the game Did you lose interest? No reason - Your mom phoned. - What did he say? What did he say!... He invited us to dinner ... What do you say? - Why do you always watch this movie? - I don't know, it's the chess game ... The horse loses. Has lost I want to tell you something. Behind the move they made today Behind the explosives movement, there are highly refined minds. Another mob! Good Morning... You have no idea about the casino. They even say that the bomb you put it, since the mafia never fails ... Are you telling me this? It is hinted that for the post of deputy attorney general, you did not leave anyone Are you surprised? After the letters from Meli and Corvo? Giovanni, why don't we go away from this damn place? I talk to my Swiss colleagues and then I disappear And where you're going? I don't tell anyone, not even Francesca. I want to stay just to breathe again We have been talking about moles for years. I don't want to feel cumbersome like General De La Iglesia. Dr. Falcone, sorry. I should ask you a couple of questions. One serious and the other a little less. Shall we start with the least serious? What is this story of the attack? Judge Falcone was unanimously elected Deputy Attorney General. The other four competitors, although having greater seniority, have withdrawn their candidacies, making it easier, the way to a magistrate for such incredible merits. One of the most authoritative and valid interpreters of the fight against the mafia. He finally saw the good news. - Yes of course. - Has my husband finished? - He's interrogating Mannoia. Are here. Francesca. Where are we going to celebrate my appointment? I don't want to celebrate Does what happened sound normal to you? They slap you first and then unanimously elect you! I don't know, they will have changed their minds. I do not know... You may not be telling me the truth. Why don't you react? First the bomb that you put on alone, then the lies of the Corvo and now this story that you had to lose the third level, to be chosen. Giovanni, what are you waiting for? Love ... the slander denies itself. After the sting of the sentence, Dr. Riina told me to stay calm that counted on the promise of Judge Carnevale ... - Carnival? - Yes, Carnival, Carnival. to abort the process. For the vices of form, you understand? Look, Mannoia, you can say what you want to the first section of the Cassation Judge Carnevale ... But this is not the problem, the problem is another. Doctor. Mannoia, I have bad news for you - My mother - Her sister and aunt too. - Did you know about those three women? - Of course - It didn't look like that. - Tell me what I should do! Perhaps it would have been better to say sorry for not saying anything about politicians. I'm upset, I wonder if my work is of any use There is a dossier on Lima of dozens of pages over the years - See if something happened! - Of course... Then Andreotti will continue to say "Don't look for skeletons in our closets, you will only find evening dresses. " If there are people like U'Dottore within the state Can you tell me how to take the judgments of the Court? So what is there to do? Massacre them? Even us ... always locked at home, locked in the car, Always armored so they don't kill us ... But why? So it is a useless sacrifice? Do you know what the real catch is? Thinking of perpetrating the fight against the mafia ... only in judicial terms, instead of realizing that it is a political question. Doctor, you can finally come in. I know, the process of La Torre, the civil law instance plus the investigation supplement. For the Gladio case, we will have to join at the request of this consultation. Among the political processes, this is the most confusing. We will make each decision at the time of the request. Sit down. You know very well that if we do not reach the request ... we don't have time to do the survey. I'm going to Rome to meet the judges who deal with Gladio. So much smoke and nothing concrete. Of course it would be comfortable for the communists, that those who killed La Torre were the secret services ... - Then? - All right, I'll talk to Rome tomorrow. Miss, I've been waiting for half an hour ... Yes, wait, but today is a day off. Sorry I didn't. I haven't telephoned Rome yet. Agree... Please doctor I knew that my colleagues El Fuerte and Pignatone they met Cardinal Pappalardo for the story of Nora Lazzarini in the Mattarella trial. - If possible. Sit down. - Forgive me. You can continue. You know that the only reason that pushed me to come to the Attorney General's Office is to see anti-mafia coordination. Of course, I promised you. Now let's make the coordination effective. - Did you call Rome? - I forgot again. I also think you have to sign. I needed to hear you say it. Bye. What's the matter? What's up ... Nothing's wrong! That is the problem. I am obliged to sign. What if it was a mistake? What about removing Riina, La Torre and Mattarella from the maxi process? On the contrary, I begin to think that that was the only way for the maxiprocess to be performed. There are political crimes ... beyond which there is a threshold ... That cannot be passed. What if you did not sign this request? It would be a scandal. It would be the casinos against me. Go to the anti-mafia commission, CSM ... to justify me. They threw a sack of garbage I laugh The mob will kill me and do me justice. But it is not said Look what I did I had it framed. What's the matter? I do not like it I found out on the radio that you are going to Rome Doctor, do I send these too? - Yes thanks. And tell me why are you going? You were always number two in the Procuratorate ... Yes, but Giammarco is still number one. I don't want to stay, I would feel humiliated I don't want to cover him and his team. Because Martelli is better than him. and Andreotti who made him a minister ... You forgot that in '87 he was elected with the votes of the mafia. Paolo, you, me ... in the long run We are stronger than politicians. You are naive, Caponnetto was right. Maybe I missed it ... I think that no politician will be able to copy me This is a challenge, you are not one of them ... When it's time to decide, they will trust you. I have to continue with my work, someone must trust me ... I do not want to be marginalized or be killed. In Martelli I trust, he is a person who gives new signals. The wolf loses its hair ... Yes! I take a moment with Falcone, see you Ahead. What's going on Nothing, just two minutes. A crucial point for me. Let's say the super attorney must report to the Minister of Security and Justice, he in turn must inform, to the Council of Ministers to inform the Italian Parliament. - This all looks like ... - The San Antonio chain. That's right ... I'm thinking of the faces of my colleagues What a great job Falcone did! Up to the Magistracy and does so at the service of political interests. This law puts us at the level of the most advanced countries. I agree, but I am always thinking about the law! They will say that Italy is a different country from the others. Than the suspicion of illegality, if not worse ... It also touches all the vertices of the state ... - Good morning Doctor. - Good Morning. Who is the meeting with Falcone with? He's meeting with the attorneys general! - Yes right, have they all come? - I would say yes, there are several. Here they are dating. We should think about agreeing the negative balance of the first two years of application of the new code The product is based on that there has been a great demand ... The process has reduced criminal prosecution for politicians. For thieves, petty drug dealers, and prostitutes ... We believe that for once. We can do it. I came to greet you. I was waiting for you They also called me to Rome, a beautiful city ... But not like his Palermo. Ya ... And at the end of the meetings, discussions and calls, the Magistrates Association, called for a national strike to protest against the attitude of the president of the republic Cossiga regarding the CSM and against the decree law regarding the super attorney. Listen well, talk to all the press and launch this statement ... I declare illegal the strike called by the Magistrates Association, because it is against state law. Wait, you can't get up against all the judges. They are the ones against it. You got it right, all the press immediately! Giovanni, I got the voting results Cordova 3, Falcone ... 2. - You lose it by 1. - Oh yeah? I was waiting for it Sorry, this CSM never ceases to amaze us! Yes of course there is always hope for a plenum Do you want to get an official statement? Find it, I don't care about that, who said yes or no! No thanks, I won't give any more interviews at least until the plenum. I take the line, if Giovanni is at peace, I am not! I already made a statement. I accused the magistrates that they had a conspiracy and a campaign against Falcone. They know that I will never give consents to Córdoba at the cost of going to the Constitutional Court, For me, the only candidate for Super Procuration is Giovanni Falcone The Cassation annulled, the judgment of the Court of Appeals of Palermo that a few years later had damaged the Maxi Process. In this way, the Cassation confirms the verdict of the Maxi Process and with that the validity of the Buscetta theorem. La Cosa Nostra is a unitary and vertical criminal organization. Mother! They were right! We did it... Did you understand the Supreme Court? I wonder how happy Giovanni is. Good Morning. Andreotti is here? - The delegation is in Punta Reis. - Perfect The menu is amazing It's a sure vote ... After the fall of the Berlin Wall many things have changed Impunity also fell from the gangsters, from their protectors. You have to give time to time. Wall or no wall, who's behind U'Dottore, the P2, the secret accounts in Switzerland, Mafia, politics will never give up I'm going to be a Super Attorney, you to the position of Giammarco, because this is what you want ... Who can stop us? In La Procuración a new mafia is being born, a mafia that we do not know, that may have already been born. You may have new means, new procedures Exporting capital abroad ... You know who they are? Judges investigating a police scandal. On model es Di Pietro, no Falcone ... It's okay. The fact is that with Falcone there was no model. To acquire new operational and coordination instruments I'm talking about the DIA, the Super Attorney General's Office. Excuse me, Falcone. Truly the DIA cares for us, because so far everything has been unduly interfered with in the investigation of the Polyclinic scandal - We have reported this interference. - With whom? To the competent bodies! The competent offices all report to the state! Exactly. As the state we are all, We will look for a way to find the instruments, so that they are well used. - What state are you talking about? - The state is one. But you don't understand where it is! We do not like that you are inside the Government Palace! The role that I cover is intended for the magistrates. Yes, but it is the prerogative of politicians ... Falcone, the magistrates answer to no one! So yes, you must take responsibility, like everyone else ... ¡Falcone, Falcone! ¡Falcone, Falcone! Sorry Do you wonder why the minister does not unblock the situation with CSM? We are sure that the minister wants to direct the Super Procurement. Try it! Is this an interview or an interrogation? What do you say? I trust you and you trust me ... It is said that you meet in secret with political leaders who are not socialists. And you don't trust me? ¡Espere! Giovanni, one last thing. - Do you regret it? - Yes. To have been one step away from a change of era, and I couldn't make it, but don't write that down. Stay calm, I won't write anything! No, in fact he writes ... that he dies when left alone, If you play too big a game You've seen, I'll checkmate you. - Hello - Say? Is taking off - Cut that long branch. - Agree. - No, the other one. - Now I'll cut this one. - Cut it, cut it! - That's OK? Yes, it looks better now. They landed on the runway. Montinari, don't abandon me anymore! Welcome ma'am. - I take care of her, right? - Yes thanks. I prefer to sit next to my husband They are leaving ... Excuse me, doctor. Do you prefer to see the house first? - I don't know, you decide. - Yeah, we better go home. There they come. Oh my God! Take it easy... It starts there. Rocco, answer! Motherfuckers Please, Agents! Close the door He's dead, doctor. We could not do anything - Did you write a report? - Yes of course. - Will you read it to me, please? - Yes. The patient arrives with a cardio-circulatory arrest. He has a cutting wound in the frontal and occipital region. Signs of fracture in both lower limbs The patient is intubated, cardiac massage is performed, infracardiac adrenaline without any success. Dr. Borsellino, if you want, you can accommodate there ... No, I am fine Thank you. Giovanni... Ah! Nino ... it's you ... Giovanni is dead. In the name of all who have given their lives for the state ... First I ask, what is justice doing? Addressing the mob men, because that's why we're here ... men, but certainly not Christians. Know that even for you, there is a possibility of forgiveness ... I however forgive them if they have the courage to change ... But they don't change! It's me mom Leave me, I want to see my dad. - It can not happen! - Let me! Dad! Nerd! Please let's go... It's fine I understand it. Are you doing the service report? There is also my name. - Yes. - Toglilo. I have never been here Take it off! Mafia leaders Riina and Santapaola they are captured after decades of inaction. Minister Martelli is forced to resign due to his involvement in the Swiss P2 account. Italians await the truth about the Sicilian massacres after waiting 25 years for the other massacres that stained Italy with blood.
