Granny: The park sure looks lovely today. Ah, there's nothing like a nice, relaxing game of whist at the looney club. Both: Hi, granny. Hello, kids. How are things at my favorite children's park? Best read it yourself. "This park to be closed in 80 days." Unpaid debt? E-Excuse me, kids. I need time to think about this. [Gasps] Huh? [Ticking] Uh... Mmm... [Growls] [Snarling] Sylvester: I detest the sight of ribs from the inside. [Pop] Grr... Man: Pure balderdash, I say! I've suffered the last defeat at the hands of my cursed Nemesis cool cat. Why, his preposterous antics have been my absolute undoing. Unh. Still, it's best to be bested by an intelligence better than mine. There! I said it. What is it that you said, colonel rimfire? Well, that, simply put, there is no greater intelligence on earth than the feline intelligence. Well, he certainly got that right. Get back here! Eek. Some globe-trotter he is. Colonel, do you mean to say that no creature on earth is capable of outsmarting a cat? Madam, I'll stake my entire fortune on it. What about it? Do you gents concur? [Discussing] Hmm... You're on. [Slap] [Gasps] I know a certain little canary who is more than a match for any cat. [Tweets] Poppycock! No, tweety. What crapulous rubbish! Why, I've never heard anything like that in my life. I propose that my tweety can travel around the world in 80 days, collecting the pawprints of 80 cats. Ha! Ohh, for granny, I'll do it. I was getting tired of outwitting the same old puddy tat anyhow. Since today is October 2nd, tweety will encircle the globe and return with a canceled passport and his 80 cat pawprints to this very spot on December 21st in exactly 80 days. Madam, you've made yourself a wager. Oh, bully for you, granny. You stood up to him, you did. Well done, granny. [Rattling] Ever get the feelin' you just missed something? Now tweety, with the looney club's high connections, I've obtained your own special royal passport. Royal passport? You get customs in each country you visit to stamp the up-front pages, and these extra pages in the back are for all the pawprints you'll collect along your route. Now, I don't want to overburden you, but I did bet the farm that you could safely pass every port of entry. Sheesh, already with the guilt. I'll pass every point--paw, too. I'm off! [Crowd cheering] Can it be done? Certainly not. Circle the globe in time and then return to this spot? There isn't a hope, a ghost of a chance. I bet from London, tweety won't even get to France. It's all in vain. Well, it can't be done. And when this thing is over I'll have won. He can make it all the way. It's impossible, I say. Is it yes, or no? * can little tweety go * * around the world in 80 days? * * england, France, Tibet, Peru * it's impossible to do. * to make it 'round the world in 80 days * to Argentina, Rome, Seville, Tibet, Berlin, Japan, Brazil. * you can't traverse the world in 80 days * * it's all in vain, why, it's insane to even try * * to go from Budapest, Malaysia * * through Nepal and half of Asia * * out to Spain, the mid-Ukraine * * and French versailles * are you ready? On my Mark. Are you steady? Then embark. * that's the bird * * we all adore * * I'm gonna do what no one else has done before * * he's going 'round the world in 80 days * * right through to Pakistan * * Taipei, and China, Budapest, Bombay * * I'm gonna see the world * * in 80 ways * all those exotic habitats. Outsmarting puddy tats! * around the world in 80 days * * I gotta check but you can bet * * that when I'm through * * I'll be back to say I won * * on December 21 * * oh, yes indeedy * * I'll be speedy * that's my sweetie. All: Hooray for tweety! * it's the chance, I'm gonna take it * * I say he'll never make it * * no one's ever done it all the ways * * gone around the world * * in 80 days * gotta run. "Royal passport stolen." Sooner or later, you'll have company, mate. Those foreign pussycats gonna nab my lunch? I'll fix that canary. [Tweeting] Hey! First, you gotta catch me, puddy. Well, first things first. Tweety: I'm right on course for Paris, France. Hey, I'm being blown too far east by this stiff wind. I'm lost some place over the alps. Unh. Whoa! Oh! Unh. Excuse me, Mr. Mountain climber. I could use a hand. A hand? I could use my own movie. You canary. Uh, that's beyond my control. Some assistance, please. Huh! Mr. Popular. Ahh! When life hangs in the balance, you can always depend on one thing. Extreme sports. Nyah! Ahh! Ah! Some cameo this is. How the heck did I get here? [Stammering] Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Oof. Thanks. You're a couple of crown jewels. Eh, it's a living. Humph. Show off. Sheesh. 10 days in Paris and no sign of that stupid bird. They must have dropped a whole sequence or something. A pussycat can't live on decaf cappuccino trailmix cafe au lait, for crying out loud. He must have got lost. Probably be another month before tweety finds old gay Paris. [Cat snarling] Huh? Hey! Watch it, sister. No, you don't. Whew. That Paris customs office better be close. Nobody swipes my canary croissant, mademoiselle. Merci. Oh, Mr. Customs man, this might interest you. [Speaking French] You 2 skunks must not fight over moi. Skunks? Tch, tch, tch. It is so UN-mademoiselle. Merci. That's one down, 79 to go. [Snarls] French bubblegum. Sylvester: Listen, i--i--i know how it looks, but you've got it all wrong. I'm not a skunk. Skunk: May love can never be wrong. [Kissing] [Sylvester screams] Foghorn: Place your bets here. Place your birdseed bets. Step, I say, step right up and place it on tweety. Yeah. He's leaving, I say, he's leaving France. Jet streams are blowing him southeast way ahead of schedule. [Beeping] [Indistinct voice] We've set the odds at 20 to 1 in tweety's favor. [Indistinct voice] Come on. Bet some birdseed. Don't be chicken. My goodness. Haven't we come far enough to stop using that horrid term? Keep your shirt on, prissy. He's just, I say, just stirring the wagering pot. Looks like our fine feathered friend is heading into venetian territory. Uh, venice, Italy, that is. Whew! I'm famished from tasting nothing but bubblegum. Oh, boy. Italian grub. Birdseed with your best marinara sauce. Mm-hmm. Oops. I overdid it on the basil. Unh! Oof! Whew. Unh! Oof. Well, there are other modes of transport. Unh! Ahh! Row me to the venetian consulate. Ah, venice. City of romance, architecture, food, and-- uh-oh. Italian puddy tats! Of course, this completely wrecks the present digestive situation. Oh, Mr. Gondolier? [Snarls] [Gasps] I've got a queasy feeling, and this bridge has got 5, 10, 15 puddy tats. Oof! [All gasping] [Tweety burps] Tweety: It was all gas. Who knew? Thank you. [Cats snarling] Not only does this rest my little wings, but it's a great way to find pawprints. Lola bunny here, with an lnn tweety update. That trusty ankle transmitter indicates our globe-trotting canary has successfully navigated the canals of venice. Venetian locals confirm tweety has amassed a grand total thus far of 37 feline pawprints. [All murmuring] Pure dumb luck. Absolutely. Prepare to back that up, colonel. I am. I'll add to the wager my complete Nash hubcap collection. Oh, why I'll break out my moustache wax reserves and triple my wager! Ho ho. You, colonel, are the latest in a long line of people to underestimate tweety. [Breathing heavily] Whew. Oh, you must be the Egyptian counsel. There's one thing I need right here. Your stamp. Oh, and love your Fez. [Yawns] Whew. I just flew in from Italy, and boy, are my arms tired. Wow! Now that's what you call a snub nose. Sticks and stones may break my nose, but names will never hurt me. [Yawns] I think this is a good time for me to take a little catnap. Ooh, what I just said. [Giggling] [Yawns] [Slurping] There's my little desert oasis. Let's get 'em, boys! [All snarling] Uh-oh. I thought I saw a pack of desert puddy tats. Give me about a 20-second lead, then follow me. I did. I did see a pack of desert puddy tats. Hah! Mmm, humph. Huh? Cat: Duh, 18, 19, 20! Sylvester: Oh, stupid mercenary pussycats. [All snarling] I better hide in here. Come back here, you desert sandwich. Whew. I should be safe in here from that bad old puddy tat. Oh, look. A piccolo. [Playing] Doesn't look like any mummy I ever met. Say, pretty lady, do you know what tunnel I can take to get out of here? Ah, ah, ah! Ahh. [Gasping] You've heard of the Lincoln tunnel? Well, that's the stinkin' tunnel. Ah! Pf-ooey! Oh, what's this? Lucky for me, I'm a graduate of the hooked-on- hieroglyphics program. "Death comes on wings to he who enters the tomb of the pharaoh." Say, I have wings. And I've got you. Oh, puddy, can you read hieroglyphics? Certainly. Well, then. You better read that. Ah, um, "no shirt, no shoes, no service." Hmm. Nothing like eating in a classy joint. You've been on my menu for a long time. Just a minute, bub. Say, pal. Can't you see I'm about to dine here? [Muffled snarling] [Weakly] Mommy. Looks like Egyptian cats have more than 9 lives. Now, if I could only find a way out of here. [Sylvester screams] Thanks, bad old puddy tat. Ooh, there will be plenty of opportunities to collect pawprints in the jungle. [Loud stomping] Say, cousin, could you tell me where I might find some cats around here? [Snoring] Hmm? Unh. Oops. Dead end. Tweety: Could you stamp this passport? Thanks. Don't go in there. It's scary. Huh? Lucky for me, that lion swallowed the local counsel. [Growls] [Roars] Tee-hee-hee-hee. Oof. Oof, oof. [Laughing] And you call yourself the king of the forest. Sheesh. Target in sight. Bombs away. Direct hit. Uh-oh. Uh-oh again. [Both snarling] Huh? Huh? Ah! Ah! Guess they never heard the saying "birds of a feather flock together." [Laughing] Hmm. Odds are way--i say-- way up on tweety. Right now, it looks like our bird's heading for Tibet. Tibet? He's supposed to be the one everyone else is wagering on. No, no, son. Tibet the country, not the infinitive. Uh, verb, that is. Well, why didn't you say so? Nice boy, but his skylight leaks a little. Ahh! Thanks. Whoa! Whoa! Talk about your air turbulence. Say, what a spectacular view. Strange. I didn't know there was anything else built this high up in the himalayas. Subtle, isn't it? Hmm. Looks like these locals are gonna put on some kind of peaceful ceremony. [Tweeting] [Gasps] Male voice: Oh, great yellow one, please accept our meager sacrifice, this puny canary, known as awooga. Tweety: Oh, my gosh, those cats are about to sacrifice that poor little canary in the name of a statue that looks just like me. Here goes nothing. What the--hey! Whaa! Whaa! [Moaning] Pfffttt! Pfffttt! What force of nature dares disrupt our peaceful canary sacrifice? This force of nature, bub. [Gasps] It is you, oh, great one. Please forgive us for displeasing you. Your wish is our command. Name it and it shall be yours. Well, there is one thing. [Tweeting] Aw, stop it. You're embarrassing me. Besides, I got some rules to dictate. Now, take this down. We promise never to sacrifice any more birds, by order of the great one himself. Promise? Oh, I suppose so... But what will we do with ourselves on Saturday nights? Well, I picked up a friend here who might be able to answer that question. Oh, I always wanted a little kitty cat to love and play with me. Now I got me a whole bunch to call my own. Are you always such a kind, caring person, tweety? When I have the time. Oh, my gosh, time! It's an honor to offer your pawprints to the great canary, guys. How lucky you are. Say, you're pretty handy at this, awooga. When you're the only canary in a land of cats, you catch on quick. Whoa, that's enough. Leave some for the other countries. Other countries? I've got half the world yet to see before I get back to england on December 21. Mind if I join you? Why not? Just one question, awooga. Why do they call you awooga? Heh heh heh heh. [Horn sound] Awooga! Never underestimate a small package. Come on, awooga, half the world is our oyster. Ohh! Extreme sports are a ubiquitous global commodity. Whoa! Whoa! [Speaking Chinese] Thanks. Please, ship it ahead. Now that was off the wall. Whoa! We're at the mercy of the jet stream. Mexico? Man, that was one powerful gust of wind. Thanks. We can't carry all these trophies. Whoa, ho ho! Whoa! This must be rio. Duh...by the sea-o. Ohh! Button youse lip, mugsy. We're supposed to be hidin' out in this here country. Ohh. Mmm. Tweety: Much obliged. Oops. Wind express. Lovely detour, but we've gotta get back on track. Ow! That chafes. Ha, hi! Ahh. We'll be fine as long as you don't run out of sticky notes. Whoa! Whoa! Enough of this backwards business. Let's show the jet stream who's boss. Whee! Whee! TV anchor: The world continues to marvel at tweety. That's just peachy, but the world is made up of a lot more than just birds. Besides, I'm hungry. TV anchor: Tweety seems to have added a traveling companion along the global route. Well, I say, all right. 2 birds, one mission, more birdseed bettin'. Ah, yes. [Cheering] First China, then Mexico to Japan. Now that's takin' the direct route. Hurry up, awooga. There goes our boat to america. [Horn blows] [Breathing hard] Take a rest, awooga. I know that your hair must be tired. I always heard there was lots of food on these cruise ships. [Laughing maniacally] Oh--oh! Ah, you must be the cat we got to catch those pesky mice. They're in the galley. Get to it! Uhh! You can come back up when you've caught 'em. He don't know him very well, do he? Might as well have a couple of mouse appetizers down here then go topside for the main course. Mmm...heh heh heh. Hey, Bert, we're on a boat leaving Japan, headin' to america eatin' Swiss cheese. Yeah, hubie, ain't it great bein' a mouse? Sure thing, Bert, sure thing. Say, hube, what do you say we take a jog around the deck to work off some of this cheese? Right behind ya, Bert. All we need to do is run... For our lives! Aah! Come back here, you p-p-pesky stowaways. Heh heh. Don't ask us where the skillet went. [Laughs] Ok, here's what we're gonna do, Bert. First you... [Whispering] Hee hee hee, and then I will... Hee hee hee. Heh heh heh. Riot. Heh heh. Pffttt! Pffttt! Help! Pussycat overboard. Pffttt! [Roars] Got ya! What--whoa, ho! Whoa, ho! [Gasps] Nice effects. Yeah, aah! [Whimpers] Aw, the poor puddy wants to go play with those sharks, but his claws are all stuck. Don't worry, puddy tat, I'll liberate you. Ohh...unh! Ohh...unh! Aah! [Splash] [Chomping and fighting] Ooh, look how fast that puddy tat can swim. Heh heh heh. Yeah. Riot. Help! Help! Cat overboard! Gee, I think puddy is in real trouble. We'd better help. Ready, awooga? Both: 1, 2, 3! Come on. [Gasping] Phew. What I won't do for Warner brothers. You saved my life. How's that for irony? There goes our ride. If you use your imagination... And here comes the tide. Aah! Aah! Aah! [Panting] [Coughing] Where are we? It's not on my itinerary, but look! Thanks. G'day. Wow! Wherever we are, they sure grow big mouses. Those aren't mice, puddy tat. They're kangaroos. We're in Australia. Well, I see a shrimp I'd like to put on the bar-b. Hey! Cut that out. Ha--huh? What--ha ha! Ms-5 water spout! Duck and cover! [Babbling] Aah, ha ha! It's a twister with really big teeth. Mmm...eee! Tas hungry. Heh heh heh. I thought you were Australian. Heh heh. Time for tas dinner. [Gulps] You look like the kind of guy who savors a fine gourmet meal. Well, let me tell you what. [Whispering] A couple of canaries... That puddy's up to something. We'd better take off. Going somewhere? Fly for it! Get me outta here! Smells like a butcher shop. Huh? [Growling] Eep. Uh-oh. Let's peel rubber! Huh? Hmm? Ohh. Hmm. Heh heh. Varoom. Punch it. Whoa. Safety first, mate. Look! There they are! Hey, it's extreme sports, not extreme peril. Yeah, aah! Aah... Uh, uhh! Cats hate water. What am I doin' here? Hey, puddy, what's cookin'? [Growls] Aah! Where did those 2 snacks go? Now, don't you be gettin' any ideas. Wait. Stop! Nooo! Eeee....whoa! Whoa, ho ho! Oh, ow, oww, whoa, whoa! [Laughing maniacally] Aah! Uhh! Uhh! Va-varoom! Mmm, mmm, mmm! Heh heh heh. Varoom-varoom. [Sputtering] Heh heh. Heh. Tas like. There goes our deposit. [Breathing hard] Whoa! Got ya. Either you got low blood sugar or you're just plain pooped. I can't continue. You go on without me. No way, awooga. We'll find a boat out of here. Well, we'd better find it quick. Look. Hey, bright eyes, step on it. My lunch-- I mean, our lunch is getting away. [Groaning] Hiya! Heh heh heh. Heh heh heh. Aah! Huh? Ooh. [Splash] [Grunting] Uh-oh. We got a stowaway on the forward mast. Time to bail, awooga. Hiya, puddy. Got ya! Careful, silly, you could fall. Whaa! Ha ha ha. So long, puddy. Aah! Ha ha ha ha! Meeeeeooooow! Puddy can fly about as well as he can swim. Oh, no, not the water again. Huh? Aah! Uhh... Oh, no. Gee, puddy, you think of everything. Looks like we're gonna ride the waves all the way to San Francisco. Ahh, San Francisco. Be careful, tweety. This bay is rather crowded. Whaa! That puddy tat just can't stay out of the water. Ohh! Let's land on the famous fisherman's wharf sign and breathe some fresh smells. We can find pawprints around the wharf, but we gotta go into town to get my passport stamped, then head over to the train station. Well, that takes care of the United States. Where to, awooga? I'm hungry. How about some-- lunch? Yikes! Oh, no, you don't! [Snarls] Hmm? Whaa-ha! Eeh! Uh... Talk about your fast food. Uh-oh. Hold on, awooga. It's gonna be a bumpy ride. We could just fly, but what fun would that be? Meow! Come back here! Whee! [Trolley bell rings] Canaries, the San Francisco tweet. Next stop: Union square. Hey! What the-- Ohh! Ohh! Stop it! Stop it! You'll never make the turn if you don't slow down at the bottom of the hill! Pull back on the stick, ya nitwit! [Groans] Give me that there brake throttle! There's a reason they don't hire kitty cats for this job. Hmm? Uhh! Oww! Oh, now you done caused us to jump the track, you furry galoot! Uhh! Uhh! [Whistles] You take it! No, you! No, no, no! You take it! No, you! Ohh! Aah! Razzin' frazzin' fog. I blames you for this. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Gee, I wonder where we are? Aah! Aah! Get us down off of here, ya itchy feline! Ohh! Aah! Slow up, ya dang cat! I think we're back on market street. Huh? Huh? "Welcome to Alcatraz." That's a closed-up hoosegow... Built on an island! [Bawling] Ya got us stuck on this stupid rock, ya good for nothin' feline. Ya no good razzin' frazzin' kitty cat! Get back here and take what for! Come here, boy! He must be the cat man of Alcatraz. Heh heh heh. We'd better get goin', awooga. Our train will be leaving the station any minute. Look! A beautiful f-1 antique diesel to commemorate my global trip. What a maroon! Ha ha ha ha ha. [Groaning] [Train door opens] Huh? Huh? Holy smokes! We've got to highball! Great horny toads! I've been railroaded. I'm 30 seconds ahead of schedule. We can afford to pause and check my odds. "Check our odds on tweety's global trip." Hmm! The odds are I'll eat that darn canary. [Screeching tires] Jeez, this must be where all pussycats go on their 3-day weekends. Hey! Uh--uh--what's the big attraction? Catnip samples? He's somewhere here in Vegas, but he won't finish. No bird can pull it off. Yeah, what do they think they're doin'? Tweety, I don't believe they want you to win. Tch, tch. Just like puddy cats. * those birdies are lost * * it's over and done * * they're callin' 'em frauds * * they're puttin' the odds at 100 to 1 * * it's a walk in the park * * it's a kick in the pants * * we're standin' on top and tweety don't stand a chance * * he thought he could win * * you know what I say? * * they yell congrats, you're smarter than cats * * well, baby, no way * * you're fallin' behind, so I'll say in advance * * it's in the bag and tweety don't stand a chance * * he's gonna do great * * he's comin' on home * * he got past Cairo, London, Frankfurt, Paris, and Rome * * he can't be stopped * * and he's gonna win * * so place your bet 'cause tweety bird's headin' * * I said, headin' on in * * there ain't no way * * he's on his way * * he's going to fail * * he's gotten those prints * * he's starting to sweat * * and you can bet * * he's going to fail * * he's almost home * * he's way behind * * he's out in front * * he's in a bind * huh? * that's why we're bettin' the farm * * 'cause none of you stand a chance * excuse me. Hey! Pardon. Pardon me. Ow! Oh. Shut up! * he knows the way * * old tweety's lost * * he's almost here * * he'll never get home * * he got past Cairo, London, Frankfurt, Paris, and Rome * * he's given it up * * he'll keep his cool * * he'll blow a fuse * * he's gonna win * * he's gonna lose * * and I'll tell you now * * that none of you stand a chance * [doorbell rings] Waiter: May we help you? Boy: If you please, sir, we'd like to see granny. Granny, we hate to bother you in here, but we just got kicked off the street for selling flowers without a permit. We can't afford a permit. There, there. Granny hasn't forgotten about you. [Granny whispering] * I'm tellin' you now that none of you stand a-- * hold it! Granny pledges the bulk of her winnings to save a destitute British children's park. * I'm tellin' you now that none of you stand a chance * [cheering] Save a park? Like I need a stronger push. Ooh! Oww! Look, it's them! All: Tweety! Get the bird! [Gasps] Ohh! I got your pawprints right here! Ooh! Ooh, tough crowd. Whoa! Heh heh. Huh? Got ya! Awooga! Ooh. Cat: Hey, there they are. [Painful laughing] Stick with me, hon. You're good luck. [Purrs] Ohh. Ohh, we gotta scoot. That last song made us a whole minute late. Ah, New York, New York. Flying by night through the poconos put us a whole day ahead, awooga. Your internal sense of time is truly infallible, tweety, but can't we enjoy the sights for once? Mmm, well, I suppose so. Look. There's Times Square. It looks like the center of the universe. Eh, you might say that. Awooga, if you were a hotdog, what kind of hotdog would you be? A plump, tasty, juicy one... With lots of mustard. Ohh! Whaa! Oh, drat. You've sabotaged my Manhattan destruction weapon with an inferior grade of earth condiment. Another dissatisfied customer. Huh? Hold the onions. Awooga! [Growls] Got ya this time, ya little-- Jeez, nothin' like gettin' your nose rubbed in it. Oh, there's just gotta be some way of catchin' that bird. Huh? "Stolen royal passport"? As granny might say, aha. Stolen royal passport still missing! Here's where I get to be scintillatingly incandescent and downright smart, too. [Laughing maniacally] Oh...2 canaries, one concorde ticket. Just think, tweety... In an hour and a half you'll be in London, finished with your global trip a full day early. Yeah, I know. What's wrong? It's just that I'll be there in no time and down to just one puddy tat to outwit. Where's the stretch? You mean you want more of a challenge? That's it, awooga. Who needs supersonic? We can ride the jet stream back to england instead. After all, we are a full day ahead. Whoa. Isn't that cutting it close... And risky? Risk is my middle name. How hard can it be? Just look at our success so far. Are you with me? What do you think? Give this concorde ticket to somebody that really needs it. I'm flying home the old fashioned way. [Meowing] Hey, what you got there, pussycat? Holy cow! [Whistle] Official police business. Official police business. Oh! Hey! What's goin' on here? Hmm? Got ya! There ya are! Hmm. Heh heh. Heh heh heh. Sorry, lads, you'll have to exit. Time to take off and all that, you know. Huh. Those birds have got to be someplace aboard that stupid supersonic plane. We do have one extra ticket if you want to come to London that badly, sir. I'm flyin' to London! What the-- so long, puddy. See ya in London. Awooga! Uhh! Tweety: That's puddy. All noise and no results. I don't like the look of those dark clouds, tweety. They just mean we'll have to flap harder, that's all. There's nothin' I can't do. I have... Both: An infallible inner sense of time. Whoa! Whoa! TV anchor: For reasons known only to tweety, the brave canary has forgone the prearranged concorde passage home and chosen instead to make this final flight leg the hard way. Ha! Rather plucky, what? TV anchor: Complicating tweety's trek is this sudden unusually late season Atlantic hurricane. Oh? Uhh! Ooh! Oh, my. Drat. There goes my electronic transmitter. Try to hold on, awooga. Whoa! Oh, my gosh. Awooga has flown. Awooga! Tweety's fin--i say, tweety's finished, boys. His signal's lost. This is it. * there ain't no way * * he'll blow a fuse * * he's going to fail * * he's gonna lose * * I'm tellin' you now * * that tweety don't stand a chance * TV anchor: The planet's next crazy global long shot, millionaire entrepreneur Mitch Hansen is rolling around the world in a wooden barrel, starting right this minute. * it's the chance, he's gotta take it * * we say he'll never make it * * 'cause no one's ever done it all the way * * ride a barrel 'round the world in 80 days * both: Just business. Unh! Unh! Unh! Awooga! Oh, my gosh! This can't be! I always come out ahead. Maybe because I always care about that the most. Well, there's only one thing that matters to me now. * you can win every race you ever run in * * you can take home every prize * * have a meteoric rise to the top of the world * * and when you get there * * you'll be there by yourself * * with just a trophy on your shelf * * the best thing you can win is a friend * * someone who can guide you * * be there right beside you * * hand in hand until the bitter end * * the only thing worth winning * * is a friend * * you can fight to get the gold and silver medals * * you can smile and hold them up * * win the golden victory cup * * and someday when you're all alone you'll see * * that trophies lose their glow * * and that's when you will know * * the best thing you can win is a friend * * when those medals start to rust * * and your memories turn to dust * * who'll be there beside you in the end? * * who cares about the race? * * who cares about first place? * * the only thing worth winning * * is a friend * [sighs] [Object falling] [Crash] Now that's product placement. Oh, the eye of the hurricane. Why couldn't awooga have held on till we got here? Now it's too late. I'm in the eye, yet I'll never see my friend again. How's that for irony? [Horn blares] Huh? [Blares] Hold that thought! [Gasps] Your passport, it floats. Oh. Unh! Well, there's your problem! Uh, thanks for saving my passport. Are you always such a kind, caring person, awooga? When I have the time. [Snarling] [All meowing] What do we do now? Oh, wait about 20 more seconds. Straight up, the only way to fly! Brrr! Come on, that's got to be the English coast up ahead. Oh, oh! Hello! Well, guess there's nobody--hey! That's a good little birdie. I've been followin' you all over the bloomin' planet just so I could have your special passport for my collection. Got any problem with that, do ya? [Gulp] Ha ha ha! [Horn blaring] Hey! Nobody puts one over on me! [Police whistle blowing] [Gasps] [Meowing] Here's the culprit. What, me? You, tweety, are under arrest for stealing the missing royal passport. This delay kills the last chance I had of making London in time to win for granny. Wait! Look! Ha ha ha ha ha! Ho ho ho ho ho ho! Hee hee hee hee! I'll take that. Hello. What's this? What's this? "By special appointment to tweety and the looney club by her royal majesty." Here, remove those cuffs. Tweety is no thief. Your papers are genuine, old boy. Sorry we ever doubted you. It was just that cat, you see. Heh heh heh heh. Huh? Blimey! This belongs to the Duke of Edinburgh! [Gasps] Aah! You're under arrest for stealing a missing royal passport. Aah! Take him to Scotland yard. [Siren] Now that it doesn't matter, I can tell you-- I think I've lost my infallible sense of time. Oh, tweety. Mmm. It would've been the second royal passport I ever stole. I should've never put 'em both in the same pocket where I keep my fish and chips. Went and caused 'em to stick, it did. Course, it would've aided me greatly to have properly learned my left from my right, too. [Bell tolls] Aw... I blew it, awooga. Oh...it's not the worst thing in the world. I let granny down. We lost so much time in that hurricane, and then on the island, those wild cats, that snow storm, being falsely accused and arrested... It was all too much to control. Tweety...control is an illusion. But I had it made, awooga. I was one day ahead in New York. [Gasps] I should have taken the concorde. I could've been a contender. [Ho-o-onk!] Holy smoke! You mean that subtitle was wrong? Mm-hmm. Tch, tch, tch. You just can't get good help hiring freelance. You see, we picked up a day crossing the international date line here but then thought we lost it in the hurricane here. But I lost my infallible inner sense of time here, too. What kept me on track after that? Tweety, don't you have someplace to be right now? Oh, my gosh! Oh, no, granny... 'Tisn't easy admitting defeat. You should have heard my sage wisdom before you made this foolhardy wager. [Tweeting] Can it be? It is! Tweety! What?! Yay! Yay! Hmph! This is most unexpected. Hmph! Let's see... France and Italy, check and check. So this is your new friend, eh, tweety? Birdy! Birdy! Birdy! Birdy! Hold it! Just a minute! This document is incomplete! There are but 79 feline impressions in here! Huh? Oh, my gosh! I forgot Sylvester! Sylvester: Hey, cut it out! That tickles! Pawprint number 80! Oh...balderdash! All right, all right! Blast it! You win! The park and my Nash hubcaps are saved! Confidentially, my sympathy was, like, with the bird. British woman: I dub thee sir tweety for helping recover the stolen royal passport. Thank you. I also have an infallible inner sense of time, but why spoil it for him? [Sobbing] Captioning made possible by Warner Bros.
