[instrumental music] In astronomy, an eclipse is said to occur when one celestial body enters the influence of another body or is temporarily hidden. Now, watch closely while I create a lunar eclipse. See? There. Now how can we define it? Gabby. A lunar eclipse takes place when the moon enters the shadow of the earth. TEACHER: Excellent, excellent. Now, watch closely as our moon comes between the sun and the earth. Now, what could this be? Oh, oh, oh! Karen. A solar eclipse. Precisely, Karen. The moon obscures the sun leaving the earth in darkness. [bell rings] Nobody moves. Nobody move until you copy down these dates. Quiz on Monday. [disappointed sighs] Quiz on Monday. First reported lunar eclipse, Babylonia 721 BC. First precisely predicted solar eclipses in Europe on June 21, 528, a very happening year. STUDENTS: [chuckles] TEACHER: Get that? STUDENTS: Yeah. TEACHER: Good. Who cares about dates? The only date I'd be interested in is with Tom Cruise. Columbus got here. That's all that matters. Karen, Karen, Karen, sweetheart. Oh, there's my mom. OK. Call me if you can sleep over. My brother's renting "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes". Sounds good to me. OK. Bye. Hi. So how was school today, sweetheart? OK. Oh, that good, huh? Now. I've got a couple of houses to show this afternoon. I'm sorry, but you're going to have to go with your sister. Aw. Why can't I stay at home and wait for Dad? Honey, I don't feel comfortable leaving you home alone, not just yet. Besides, your father called. He has to work late. Mom, I'm 12 years old. I've had six months of karate. I don't want to be with Liz. Karen, sometimes it's very hard to make the right decision. But I have to do what I think is best. Besides, it won't be so bad. Liz has her equestrian club today. KAREN: Terrific. Oh, there's your sister. Again? I have to babysit her again? Mom, see how she is? See? Liz, I'm showing an estate in Riverside and a condo in downtown Hartford at 5:00. I'm sorry. All right. Come on. Mom, just tell her she's not my boss. But I am your boss. You are not! Yes I am your boss! Enough, enough. Karen, now you be good. And get all the homework done. It'll be nonstop thrills. Honey, if we all work together, it's going to be a lot easier to afford that trip to Disney World come spring break. Mom, why didn't you say so? Mom, someday you'll think I'll be able to take care of myself. Won't you? Oh, yes, honey. It'll be someday real soon. OK. Go ahead. You're not my boss. I am. You could boss a bum. [pop music] [clicks music off] GIRL: Uh, oh. BOY: Hey. [serene music] - Will you be all right? - Fine. Just fine. See you later, OK? Go have fun. LIZ: [clicks] Come on, girl. Come on. Come on Princess. Let's go. Excuse me, do you think it would be all right if I rode your horse? Sure. Do you know how to ride? Oh, sure. OK. Just stay in the paddock, all right? OK. No problem. I'll just get comfortable. Hi, horsey. I didn't mean to fib about knowing how to ride a nice, gentle horse like you. My name's Karen. I forgot to ask yours. [upbeat music] I can see you're a very kind and gentle horse. Ooh. My name's Karen. I've never ridden before. I guess you can tell. I don't know how to downshift it. Ooh! Oh, no. Whoa! Whoa! Ah! Whoa, get a grip on yourself. Get a grip. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! [horse whinnies] Ah! Aah! [music mellows] Ump. [saddle clinking] [horse whinnies] Fair sir, will you fighter or not? Fight? What are you talking about? Don't plead ignorance of knightly law. Now, I'll ask you again. Be you my captive or will you try a passage of arms? Get real. Go back to your circus or wherever you came from. KNIGHT: Very well then. Since you care not to fight, I declare you are captive of my spear. KAREN: You're out of your gourd. I command you to march. KAREN: Well, if you put it that way. I-- I put it that way. Now move, obstinate intruder. Sir, I'm sorry to insult you. Ah, sir it is better. You may call me Sir Lancelot. - Oh, terrific. And you can call me the Queen of England. What a great teller of lies you are. Look, would you mind if you went back the other way? My sister and her holy questioning club are over there. They'd really enjoy meeting you. March. KAREN: I'm marching. I'm marching. [medieval music] Is your asylum in Hartford, sir? SIR LANCELOT: I've never heard of the place. KAREN: May be New Haven. SIR LANCELOT: And there be no New Haven. You'll find out soon enough. Help, help. Run to the stables. Somebody tell my sister I'm being kidnapped by a lunatic. Please, somebody tell my sister. Please. Please, somebody help. Go tell my sister. WOMAN: I've never seen the likes of it. KAREN: Somebody? Please. Well, you certainly gave them a start. Now didn't you, intruder? KAREN: I had no idea they let so many loony tunes run loose around here. Or maybe your asylum's in Bridgeport. There. There's the end of our March. [jubilant music] Camelot. Awesome. [adventurous music] SIR LANCELOT: Inside and be quick with you. Wait you here. Keep watch over this prisoner, who knows little of our code of honor. Excuse me. What are you an inmate here or just visiting? Pretty, fair lady. From whence cometh yee? Enough. I get your drift. Your a patient. No. I'm a page. Page? You're not much more than a paragraph. Just trying to make a little joke. Oh, I like a good joke. And your clothes are hilarious. Where did you get them? The mall. Where else? Wherever, make you look very comical. Well, you look like a carrot. I'm Karen Jones. I live at 124 Elm Street, Hartford, Connecticut. There's no Connecticut here in England. England? This is English? Aye. It twas told me since my on November the 3rd in the year-- This is England? PAGE: 513. KAREN: You were born in 513? PAGE: Aye. KAREN: What day do you think it is today? Today? Why, it's June 6 in the year 528. Today is June 6, 528. Are you crazy? There you go, making me laugh again. Is this a place where they keep crazy people? 'Tis not. You're in King Arthur's court. King Arthur's court? You're so good at acting the fool. 'Tis a very pleasing show. And your a page at King Arthur's court? Yes. But I was a trained blacksmith in Cornwall before I was captured and made a page of this court. If I'm dreaming, I want to wake up now, now! Come, you demon. The King is waiting to greet you. [boisterous chatter] Wow. What a great spread. The man with the crown on is King Arthur? You're a clever observer. Who are all the others? Well, the beauteous lady with the crown is Queen Guinevere. And the older, bearded man is Merlin, the greatest magician in all the land. And the man on Arthur's right is his nephew, Mordred. Who are the knights? King Arthur's, of course. But they're sitting around a square table. [crowd quiets] By the looks of things, you'll be meeting everybody too soon. KAREN: [gulp] MORDRED: Stay away from [inaudible] it's a strange looking [inaudible]. Beloved King, I bring before you this most audacious and foreign varlet. And what are the charges against her? Feigned ignorance of knightly law. Impersonation of our beloved queen. And her dress frightened my horse, your Majesty. I'm only Karen Jones from Hartford, Connecticut. She's clearly a monster in disguise. Notice the fiendish markings on the demon's shoes? A foreign curse she dares flaunt before our eyes. These are just sneakers. Sneakers? The very sound of the word is terrifying. Nonsense. Anyone can see she's just a little girl. She's very, very dangerous. Just look at that lurking hump on her back. This is just my school backpack. I think she's just a nice human. Dear little Clarence, always such an odd ball. Beloved husband, she seems more innocent than monster. Aye! Set her free! KNIGHTS: [cheering] Aye! [clapping] [inaudible] Enough! I will decide! What think you, Merlin? Burn her at the stake before she can manifest her powers. You guys must be kidding. What think you Mordred? I defer to Merlin's brilliance. She must be burned. Nobody has the right to talk to me like they're going to burn a marshmallow. Take her to the courtyard immediately! KAREN: Get your hands off of me. Don't you think, wise uncle? I think not with such passion about it. What passion would become you, Arthur? I have heard many of your knights wish this. Have you? Please them now by showing swiftness and strength in your decision. Very well. To the stake with her, then. KAREN: Is he kidding? I don't know how to stop them. All they believe in is Merlin's magic. KAREN: If it's magic they want, it's magic you're going to get. My Liege, I really don't think you should kill her. Stop! Stop right where you are. I'm going to zap you with my lightning box. CROWD: [gasps] [laughter] You cannot deceive us, demon. I summon an invisible chain to bind thee. [chanting] Oh, stay you here, monster! Oh, no you don't! Take that! CROWD: [gasps] And this! Take that! Take that! Counter her, Merlin, with stronger lightning. MORDRED: Oh, just change her into stone. Egads. She has trapped us in flatness. CROWD: [gasps] Where I come from, those little flat images are called snapshots. And you know what I can do with a snapshot? If I snap this in half, you'll be snapped in half. CROWD: [gasps] There is no magic that powerful. Oh? Well maybe you don't want your head. Maybe you don't want your legs. No. Please-- don't-- stop, great sorceress. MAN: [whispering] So you rule the elements and imprison our image? You are the greatest magician we have ever known. What is your name? Well, I'm the grand diva and the head honcho. I'll knock your socks off. Please, be merciful in this perilous matter. Name your terms, great magician, but spare us any mutilations. Please, take horses, serving men, gold. [groan] Did you say gold? And whatever else your greatness might require. Kindly reflect upon it. OK, I've reflected upon it. In return for not knocking you off with my lightning box, you can stay King and everything that goes along that sort of thing. How compassionate she is. But you must appoint your prime minister, and I want 1% of all revenues. That's what we call a commission. Clarence? You want anything? A blacksmith shop. And a blacksmith shop for Clarence. You take strange Clarence as your apprentice? I do. But Clarence is of little use. He has no interest in slaying dragons nor searching far and wide for the Grail. Well, in my book, he's OK. But we'll need some place to live. That's all you want? Mhm. Thank you! KNIGHTS: Yay! I hereby appoint thee prime minister and master magician of our court. My liege, what about me? You can put him in charge of the local weather report. How kind. How verily kind. And would you permit, in all your gracious kindness, that I dub you a knight of my table? Sure. Please, kneel. [medieval music] I hope he whacks her head off. With all the royal power and regal wisdom which resides in me, I dub thee sir-- but, pretty, what's your name? Boss. But since I'm a girl, you can dub me Lady Boss. But we have never dubbed the lady, only sirs. I'll have to do something about that, but sir will be OK for now. And on this joyous day of days, I dub the now Sir Boss. CROWD: Yay! I want her killed. First, we must further test her magic. And if it isn't truly potent, then, when the time is right, we'll slaughter her with the rest of these foolish people. CROWD: [cheering] [jubilant music] Please, forgive me Sir Boss for having called you an evil demon. I was too rash. That's OK. Nobody's perfect. Will this be to your satisfaction? This was the first iron melt furnace contained at the castle. KAREN: It looks cool. Aye. This will be fine. This is a super duplex. There's plenty of space for sleeping, and you can cook down here. King Arthur would want you to have the most succulent foods-- quail eggs, mutton chops, ox ribs. CLARENCE: I love ox ribs. We'll take it. Then I shall tell the King you're pleased. Tell them we're humongously pleased. If there is anything else you should need, please do not hesitate to call upon me. KAREN: Okie-dokie. I wish to offer myself as your protector, should you be challenged at battle. Thank you, Sir Lancelot. Thank you, Sir. Are you certain this place is Camelot? I swear it. This doesn't seem like the one I read about in Connecticut. Are the people here different than you read about? Yep. In the brains department, a lot don't seem to be pulling the full train. What's a train? I'll show you. Cool. Another one from your magic bag. Where I come from, all the kids have school backpacks. How blessed they are. So this huge long iron monster is a train? And what's this? Well, that's a bicycle. You pump the pedals and ride it. But it only has two non-parallel wheels. How's it keep you up? Magic? Science, not magic. Oh, but that be magic for certain. No, Clarence. It's only a mirror. We have shiny metal, but nothing so smooth as this. Marvels like these, no wonder you're disappointed in Camelot. The Camelot I heard about-- all of them might sit at a roundtable. Well they sit around here is a square one. That's how it is in the real Camelot. But this is the real Camelot. MAN: Lower the drawbridge! [horns playing] [music playing] Who's she? Morgana de la Fey, the King's sister, Mordred's mother. Does she live here too? No. she has her own castle. Welcome, Morgana. Why do you not visit us more often? My dear brother, how happy I am to see you. And Guinevere, you look more beautiful each time I see you. How we've missed you. [pleasant music] Sir Boss, how honored we are to have you visit us. What's the matter with them? They have a great fear of magicians. Come, come now, ladies. Carry on. Continue your music for Sir Boss. Sir Boss, these ladies in waiting. Hi. Queen Guinevere, I just wanted to thank you for standing up for me. It was nothing. Let it be known that my ladies in waiting and I are at your constant service. Excuse me, but what exactly do ladies in waiting do all day? Oh, so many things. We needlepoint lovely pillows, and we carve cameos from ivory. Where do you get your ivory from? The knights bring it back from their endless and courageous search for the Holy Grail, whenever they manage to kill one of those ghastly elephants. Elephants aren't ghastly. The killing of elephants displeases you? Yes, it displeases me a lot. That's all you and your ladies do all day? Sewing and carving tusks from poor elephants? We also play delightful music. Don't you ever work out? What is work out? You know, exercise to keep your body in shape. But what is exercise? Here, I'll show you. Come on. Hey, why don't you tell the band to pick up tempo? You know, the beat. Oh, but we only have one tempo. But there are lots of tempos. Here, I'll show you. [MUSIC - MARTIKA, "CROSS MY HEART"] MARTIKA: (SINGING) Hypnotized. With just one look at you, I'm paralyzed. I can't explain. Why just one touch from you drives me insane. This is a very-- very-- MARTIKA: (SINGING) You've got me head over heels. Better believe it-- Come on, ladies. Let it all hang out. MARTIKA: (SINGING) And I love how it feels. Cross my heart hope to die. May lightning strike me if I'm telling a lie. Cross my heart I swear it's true. I never loved anyone more than I'm loving you. My, this is a tempo that really takes my breath away. [music ends] MERLIN: She's taking over everything. She's a deceiver of the basest order. MORDRED: You realize how much 1% amounts? MERLIN: Tell him, Mordred. The king is blinded by this imposturous tomfoolery. MORDRED: Not for the long, Merlin. Not for long. MERLIN: She's devouring everything, infiltrating every nook and cranny with her-- [gasp] Why, you must be Sir Boss. I'm Morgana, Arthur's sister. I've heard so much about you. Hello. It's a great pleasure to meet you. From all the tales I've heard of your stunning wizardry, I hadn't expected to meet such a lovely, sweet young girl. Thank you. Perhaps you'd like to come to my room and taste of the delicate tea cakes that I've brought with me. I can't right now. Oh. I see. Then perhaps you'd like to visit me at my castle. We must have so much in common, so much to speak of. I'm sure that would be nice. Then it's settled. I'll send for you when you least expect it. I'll make it the most glorious surprise. Thank you. Thank you very much. [thundering] [feet stepping] [suspense music] [impact] [screams] What's going on? What happened? Somebody murdered my camera. [cling] [medieval music] [joyous music] Pull it back. Pull it. Ya! Ya! Ya! What's that? The knights you see use these targets for practice. Ya! Ya! Ya! SIR LANCELOT: Pull back. Bullseye! Very good. What's this, Sir Boss? Just a hot air balloon. It can lift you high in the air. You fly. Fly? Like a witch? That's something I miss. What is it? It's a telephone. It let's you talk back and forth over miles. I have a lot of telephones. Not so complicated looking and have a much better design. Look. Those are pigeons, not telephones. But they're telephone pigeons. You take one with you anywhere. And if you want to talk with me, you tie a note to it's leg, and it flies home. People can't just go around all the time with pigeons in their pocket. You don't have to. The pigeon follows you until you need it. And then you blow this. [charming whistle] QUEEN GUINEVERE: Sir Boss? Sir Boss? Be right down. My ladies in waiting and I have finished our first, as you say, significant needle point. Do you think of it? Okie-dokie, Queen Guinevere. Make sure every errant Knight gets one for his bed. Okie-dokie. Kiai! Ia! Hiai! [grunts] Oh, what fun, Sir Boss. You are teaching us so much. Ciao, baby. Ciao. Never have I seen the queen so happy. She adores you. This still isn't the Camelot I read about. Why? In Camelot, King Arthur was filled with the spirit of equality and justice. What makes you think our King Arthur isn't? Because when Lancelot marched me, I saw so many sad peasants. It's true. The people are very poor. But why? It's not King Arthur's fault. It's Mordred's and his cronies who tax everybody to death behind Arthur's back. And why doesn't somebody tell Arthur? Mordred would kill them. One lord was going to tell King Arthur, but the lord's wife warned him that if he did, she would punish him. Make his life hell on earth forever. In Connecticut, we have a punishment like that. It's called alimony. Sounds like something horrible. Oh, there's so much we need to do to make Camelot the way it should be. What's this? What have you been working on? An advertising campaign. And what weird campaign be that? It's for toothbrushes. But what are toothbrushes? We have to invent them. They're little sticks with bristles on one end. What do you do with them? You clean your teeth. Oh, sort of use the bristles to flick out stuck mutton pieces? Yeah. As Sir Boss, I'm going to make sure every knight has a sign on his shield talking about the need for toothbrushes. But who will make them? The peasants. And then they can sell them. And then they'll have enough money for food and decent housing. That won't work. Mordred will only tax the peasants still more, to keep them just as poor. But I'm going to go tell King Arthur everything, and he's going to toss Mordred out on his ear. Just make sure Mordred doesn't catch you. A toothbrush? I'd rather make a bicycle. [eerie music] Hello? Is anyone here? MERLIN: I am on the verge of creating one of the most astonishing solutions of my career. A solution greater than my boil of warthog, for which you had such generous praise. [inaudible] Yes. This be the magic elixir. [laughs] I have only to add blood of a chameleon. [laughs] And it will be complete. I be truly comforted to know this. I need but sprinkle one drop on Sir Boss, and she will be turned into a two-headed mouse. [laughs] With one sweep of my sword, I could turn her into dead. What a wonderful idea. With what ease did I slay her lightning box? Her magic is gone, but she is so diverting to Arthur and the court. It is better she breathe a little longer. But when can we kill her, Mordred. Every day, more the knights come to our side. But Arthur still has a good few faithful. Let me change them into two-headed mice. Soon. As it is, the restless peasants outside the gates are beginning to number hundreds, and will soon be ready to march with us. On that day, the King and all the faithful to him will be slaughtered. But when, Mordred, when? Within the fortnight. But now I must go. Ah. No, uh, first, let me give thee a special blessing of protection before you leave. 'Tis not a long one, I hope. Nay, nay. 'Tis the short and potent circle spell I suggest. Let Mordred gain his greatest dream. His sword with blood shall brightly gleam. First, behead the snake, Sir Boss. Then King and Queen shall be no loss. I like thee, Merlin. Twas a special blessing indeed. As for that elixir, a touch of hemlock wouldn't hurt. [door closes] MERLIN: [laughter] When we behead this snake, Sir Boss, we'll cut her to pieces. She'll make a fine sauce. [gargles] MAN: Your majesty. KING ARTHUR: My liege. Forgive me for being late, my King. But Merlin requested my presence at a special good harvest ritual, performed particularly with you in mind. That explains the great generosity of my Lord on this Day of Giving. LORD: My liege. KING ARTHUR: Your lordship. KAREN: King Arthur! King Arthur! KING ARTHUR: Ah, Sir Boss, come see what bountiful gifts I have received. I need to talk to the king alone. I really don't think this is a good time to bother the king, Sir Boss. But I-- I'm sure you didn't mean to intrude upon his pleasure. My compliments on this fine harvest. No, I certainly did not. KING ARTHUR: Mordred-- - Sir Boss. KING ARTHUR: --my lord has been most generous. Is there anything wrong? Yeah. There's a lot wrong. We need a girl to girl talk, and fast. KING ARTHUR: What think you, Mordred? The quality of the offering seems impressive enough. But the quantity is less than was expected. My king, this lord does not have a vast estate. Forgive me, Lancelot, but your counsel was not sought, as taxes are not your expertise. Indeed, in these matters, it is your ignorance that has a vast estate. The only thing not so vast would be your tongue if I put my sword to it. Mordred! Lancelot! Cease your weapons and your tempers. Sheath your weapons. But uncle, you noted I am most knowledgeable in taxes due. He is right, Lancelot. As you preserve my life, Mordred preserves our larder. Act as brothers and continue to bring me joy through your respective domains. Yes, your majesty. You wish to see me, my beautiful queen? I'd like to discuss something very disturbing about the kingdom. You must not concern yourself with such matters. They're for Merlin, myself, and Mordred, concerns for a man's mind. But Sir Boss says there's no difference between a man's and a woman's mind. What is it you wish to discuss? Sir Boss said she overheard Merlin with Mordred plotting to kill you and all those faithful to you. Merlin wants to turn Sir Boss into a two-headed rodent, and Mordred says the peasants hate you. Nonsense. Mordred is my dear nephew, the light of my sister Morgana's eye. Merlin's forever asking after Sir Boss's health, and all the peasant adore me. How can you be so sure of that? Guinevere, my laws ensure freedom and fairness for all my subjects. So outside the castle wall, you truly believe everyone is happy? Of course they are. I made the peasants free men. I gave them land and ask but little tax. And who enforces this fairness? Mordred, and he does so with my full trust. My husband, you always rule so much with your heart. Is it not possible just this once you are trusting someone you should not? No. Tomorrow morning, Sir Boss is planning to go out into the countryside to talk to the peasants herself, and I think you should go with her. Nonsense. Do you think a peasant would tell his King if he were unhappy? He would if his king were disguised as a peasant. Disguised as a peasant? My Lord, it is the only way. Talk to the people. See how they live, for the love of your country, Arthur, and for me. Dear brother, where do you rush with such vigor? Sir Boss and I are going forth from a castle to mix with the peasants, so she will learn how well they love their King. I don't understand. The peasants surely would not tell you otherwise. They will no know me. Sir Boss and I will be disguised in rags. Oh, Arthur, that's a grand idea. I've met Sir Boss. She's lovely. I haven't seen you this concerned for years. WOMAN: Your majesty. 'Tis a secret. We're leaving in the morning. I shall not tell a soul. I kiss you farewell. My lips are sealed. I pray God will be with you on this inspired quest. I shall wait only for your safe return to Camelot. I love you, sister. I love you, my brother. If you have to go, take the telephone pigeon with you. He'll follow you, and whenever you need him, just blow on the flute. Clarence, don't worry about me. I'll be OK. Good journey to you, Sir Boss. You just make sure you keep the home fire burning, OK? KING ARTHUR: Psst. Psst. 'Tis me. I know. Don't I make a grand peasant? Too grand. We'll have to work on that. But, how do you get out of here? Psst. This way. [adventurous music] Thou art letting them escape. However, it will be our duty to inform all lords and gentry to be on the lookout for two escaped lunatics traveling the countryside, one of whom claims to be King Arthur. Oh, what good will that do? A remarkable sufficiency when we offer a reward of gold for the first to slay the and bring us their heads on a platter. Finally, my darling son, the kingdom will be yours. Thank you, Mother. You're best mother in the world, the best. [cheery music] Wait. King Arthur, we really have to stop now. And what for? Look at you, you still look like a king. Well, what would you have me improve? Well first, your robe. [ripping] I thought you wanted me to look like a peasant, not savaged by a wild boar. Well, I suppose these rings must go. I'll start on your hair. Hm. [humming] I think that's quite enough. Now, I'm thirsty. Fetch me some water. You want me to fetch you some water? Well, the king deserves some privilege. Look here. Quick, bow your head. Stand up. Oh, marvelous tapestries. Stand up. Stand up. No need for that. I see quite well from here. Act humble. You're a peasant, remember? True. I had forgot it. NOBLEMAN: Respect at last. KAREN: Droop. Droop your head. I do not feel like drooping. NOBLEMAN: Why does he not look at the ground? KING ARTHUR: Not a bad animal, good sir. NOBLEMAN: This peasant dares to address a nobleman? It's too late now. You've already insulted them. Give me your sword. I will run it through anyone who thinks himself better than a free man. We have no weapons. We're peasants, remember? NOBLEMAN: [growls] How dare you have so little respect for human life, you coward. NOBLEMAN: Coward? Try that again, and my magician here will strike you with a thunderbolt. My king, please be quiet. Be more humble. I will not humble myself before a barbarian of this sort. Are you so ignorant to the laws of chivalry and your king? Your brain has all the substance of a melon. Now, I shall slice you both in half, and we'll soon see who is a melon. Try it, you delirious fool. Use your magic now. A plague upon thee, foolish metal varlet. Death to you both. Death! Use your magic, now, now. Hey! Stay right there or you'll be sorry. You plan to stop me with that pitiful chunk of iron? [screams] Stand still, so I can trim you like a lettuce. Die, you feeble fools. Sir Boss! TAPE RECORDER: You plan to stop me? With that pitiful chunk of iron? Die, you feeble fools. Who said that? Do not recognize your own blustering? TAPE RECORDER: Stand still so I can trim you like a lettuce. Ah! You've trapped my voice in that little box. I have. And if you don't clear out this second, I'll make your voice disappear forever. And then she will strike you in your head with a thunderbolt. Flee, flee, flee! Flee, flee! One is a voice witch who would smite us all. She's a horrible voice witch. WOMAN: Come on! NOBLEMAN: [laughs] [yelling] KING ARTHUR: I knew your magic would save us, Sir Boss. But I'm shocked a knight would behave so abominably to a peasant. Now you're getting the picture. These free men look so impoverished. They must be lazy or waste their harvest gambling. Look at this filthy lot. How can they squander their money so on drink? I'm sorry, sir, but think they're like this all over. Nonsense. I'll find out soon enough what's wrong. You wait outside. CHILD: Turkey, turkey, ah! [crying] Oh. Are you OK? Did you get all dirty? Oh. Don't cry. Friends, will you join me around my table for a glass of cheer? MAN: You're very kind, stranger. WOMAN: Never seen you around these parts. What would you have? Drink, food? Whatever it is you like. A brew if you can afford it, friend. Of course I can afford it. Please, sit here. Innkeeper. That's a mirror. Here. You can have it. I guess you can keep it. Now, tell me honest friends, what think you have your king? Oh, shouldn't we have more consideration for our stomachs before starting with such a concern? Is he no beloved here? Not here, not anywhere. Is he not adored? MAN: Is the plague adored? He won't be happy until he's taxed us to death. Taxes for the king are but a trifle. You must come from very far away. All within 100 miles of Camelot are taxed 90%. Who order you to pay such thievery? Don't tell me King Arthur, for I know his wishes as I do my very own. The king's nephew, Mordred, gouges everything from us but our eyes. And even our eyes if he catches us cheating over one ear of corn. You have seen Mordred himself perform these cruel acts? Arthur has given him the power of the whip. Your King has done no such thing. Your king has given you both land and property. He has given us land large enough for a grave. And I need not ask you if you love your king. What would you love is to take a chopping axe to him. Look, we don't know where you came from, but around here, our wives and children have nothing, and we have even less. I am stunned and close to tears. Don't weep for us when you can't be better off. But I am better off. And I had wished as well that all in my kingdom should thrive. I will redress your wrongs. Not before you pay the bill, I hope. Pay the bill? I'll more than pay the bill. Here. Here's for you and you and you and you. It's gold. All the gold I have today. But I'll be back with more. The King shall know of this. Are you a spy? The man's a spy. No. Though I am your king. You must take us for fools. You're a spy. You're a spy. [exciting music] You don't understand. I am here to help you. I will not rest till your wrongs are right. We're out of here. Get him. He's a spy. He's a lunatic. I am the king! [pig squeals] Stop them! They'll betray us! Don't let them get away. KAREN: Come on, King Arthur. Come on. WOMAN: The king's men will hang her. KAREN: Faster! MAN: He's a spy. Stop them! KAREN: [inaudible] Come on! Come on. Welcome, step brother, dear. And Sir Boss, welcome to your beheading. [suspense music] I know about Mordred and Merlin, but I didn't know Morgana hated you too. My own sister. Listen, sisters can be the meanest of all. I'm talking from personal experience. Now, my sister next to yours is like a pussy cat. What are we going to do? Why don't you just chant or wave your hand to make the door fly open? Or make Morgana and the castle disappear? [door unlocks] Good evening, sweet brother. What a delight to have you and Sir Boss visit my humble castle. Morgana, release us now, and I will forgive you. And I would not forgive you. Forgive him? For what? For having me live in this squalor all these years. This is a castle, not squalor. My rightful castle should never been here. My castle should always have been Camelot. Your castle, soon it will be. My loving son will be on the throne. And you will be dead. Excuse me, ma'am. May I please at least have my backpack? Why, I expect that you'd really like to get your hands on the little metal casket. Yes. Return it at once. Or she will cause a great boulder to fall on your head. As you wish, brother dear. Guard! [daunting music] Here is your metal box, my little voice witch. It's fame precedes thee. Use it now, Sir Boss. I command thee. They can pull Morgana's voice from her throat. [music picks up] They ruined the batteries. It won't work. Did you think I would not know witches and water do not mix? Then cast a spell. Transform her to a worm. It is you, dear brother, who will soon be worm food. Both of you will be beheaded tomorrow at noon. Hey, wait a minute. A little sibling rivalry's OK, but this has gone way too far. Come right back here this minute. You hear me? I know why your magic has failed us. It fails because I have failed my country, my people. No, your majesty. I still have magic. [plays flute] Look. Now I understand. A magic pigeon. You will transform it into a huge creature, and it will peck our enemies to death. No. I'll write a note, and when it gets to Clarence, he'll alert your finest knights to come and save us. Are those magic numbers on your note? Babylonia, 721 BC, first recorded solar eclipse. It's just a bunch of silly numbers. Clarence will know what to do. All right. Fly, pigeon. Fly. Fly to Clarence. Brilliant. The bird will fly to Camelot and then turn into a huge creature to fly my finest knights to save us. No. There's no point in wasting magic. Clarence will get the note and alert your knights to ride here before noon. Impossible. We're a full two days from Camelot by horse. I wrote on the note we're going to get our heads chopped off. That will just make them fly faster. It will take the pigeon a good time to fly to Camelot. Well, it could be killed by a hawk. Even if it arrives within the hour, it would take a knight another full hour to armour himself and his horse. The ground's in good condition, which would allow a seven mile gait, but we'd still have to change horses several times. Do you think they'll make it by noon? I don't think so. We'll need something else. What? A miracle. [drumming] It's dawn. You said you were going to execute us at noon. I lied. Proceed. Stop this now or Sir Boss will freeze your heart. Why don't we just try begging for mercy? Listen, all. I am your king. I am King Arthur. I command you to take my sister prisoner, now, immediately. Kill her! That didn't seem to work. Tell me now, what magic will you use to whisk my faithful knights here in time to save us? I can't whisk anyone here. Our goose is cooked. You jest with me. No. I'm dead serious. What a sense of humor. Let us begin. Who wishes to go first? Ladies before gentlemen. Whew, not where I come from. Then I shall go. Now save us. Work your magic. King Arthur, I have no magic. I think I love a joke as well as you, but-- Make haste. Chop his head off. Wait a minute. Stop. He's your brother. Please show mercy. You're right. Make it a clean cut. CLARENCE: We're coming, Sir Boss. We're coming! There's Lancelot and the gang. Wow. Lance made bicycles. Attack. Now, attack. CLARENCE: Quicker! Quicker! Quicker! Quicker! Quicker! Faster! Stop! Stop! CLARENCE: Here, your majesty. KAREN: Mean bikes. You save our lives. Look. She's going to get away. MORDRED: Welcome home, uncle. We were so worried about your absence. Your mother has shown me her true colors. You lied to me, Mordred. My lord, you listened to me. I heard you say you wanted to slaughter King Arthur. Now that is an insidious lie. I take extreme offense against my honor. In fact, I am hurt to the core by Sir Boss's charge. I too am deeply offended. I challenge you, Sir Boss, to a jousting match. Let our weapons decide between right and wrong. But I don't want to joust. Nor will she. Sir Boss will joust with me, for that is one of your laws I will uphold, my king. Defense of knightly honor. I suggest the joust be held tomorrow. Arthur, my husband, how I did miss you. But what is wrong? Mordred wants to shish kebab me. That's what's wrong. If Sir Boss permits, it is I that would be her champion against you. Oh, I permit. I permit. So be it! [horns playing] Here appears Sir Lancelot who fights this day to save the honor and the rectitude of Sir Boss. CROWD: [cheering] Here appears Mordred, who fights this day to repel the slander, according to him, by Sir Boss. CROWD: [booing] CROWD: [booing] MAN: Godspeed. WOMAN: [gasps] [gasps] MAN: Get up. MORDRED: Bring me my mace. My sword. MORDRED: Now we'll see who's strongest. Come on, come on, come on. KAREN: [gasps] KING ARTHUR: Enough of this. Let them retire to their tents. Combatants may now change steeds and weapons. SIR LANCELOT: Sir Boss. Forgive me, Sir Boss. But to date, I would say I have shamed your honor. Just hang in there. What are you doing? You at least have to look good when you go out there. This time, I will quickly knock Mordred silly, thrash him silly, crush his breastplate, demolish his skull. Oh, yeah. Sure you will. [horns playing] Now appears Mordred upon his new stead, [inaudible].. And here enters Sir Lancelot on his new steed Victory. Lancelot, the fate of Camelot is in your hands. You must win. I understand, my king. I hear with place upon Mordred a magic net which shall render him invisible to Lancelot, but not to us. Thank thee for this priceless blessing. It was the least I could do. [drumming] WOMAN: [gasps] KAREN: Clarence, all right. Make the sun shine right on Lancelot. That's it. It's perfect. That's really a knight in shining armor. CLARENCE: Awesome. MORDRED: My eyes. I can't see. CROWD: [cheering] Yeah, Lancelot. Now! Surrender or your king is dead. It was brutal of Mordred not to include you with the ladies. Their prison has more comforts. It's OK. I'm proud to be Sir Boss. And some day, everybody will find out. There's not much difference between sir and lady anyway. Being king was not enough. I have destroyed all of us and your magic by not being a good king. There are lots of kinds of magic. You haven't destroyed mine. If only someone could have warned me that I would become such a fool. I've done great harm to all my people, betrayed them and myself. This is the end of Camelot. No. Camelot doesn't end this way. I know. - Then I must not give up. - No, your majesty. First the, I must inspire Lancelot and I my men, but how? I wish I could tell you. You see them here, dispirited, disheartened. Too little have I cared for their advice. I must find a way to learn from these good men, as I did from those peasants in the inn when we sat around-- Yes? I sat there with those peasants in the round and looked each one who sat there in the eye. Seeking counsel is no weakness, but my strength-- Men, here! Move these benches and tables into one great circle. Here. Here. Now, in this prison, we will begin to build our kingdom as it should always have been. We will sit at a great round table where we will all have a voice. We will listen to each other with equal vigor. We will share our spirits and ideas. And together, we will be stronger and wiser and united. We will make Camelot the stuff of which dreams are made. KNIGHTS: [cheering] What do you want? Your veils, all your veils, throw them down to me, if you please, your majesty. Get with it, girls. What? Clarence wants our veils. Hurry up and take them off. He must have some unique plan to escape. Or Clarence is stranger than we thought. [music intensifies] It is the decision of the highest judges that tomorrow at noon the first and greatest enemy of Camelot shall be burnt at the stake. And just who is the greatest enemy of Camelot? You, Sir Boss. You are the greatest enemy of Camelot. No, Morgana. Burn me. I'm the on you hate. You, dear brother, you will be next. And then all of you! Morgana! MORGANA: [maniacal laughter] [pleasant music] You-- what? What's today? What do you mean what's today? What's today's date? What's today? I don't know, uh, June 20, maybe the 21. The year 528, right? The year is true. Why? I need to know the exact date. What's today's date? Is it the 21st or the 20th? Uh, yesterday was the 20th. That makes it-- That makes it June 21, 528. Why are you so happy? They plan to execute you at noon. No. Something very special is going to happen today. Precisely at noon, June 21, 528, we're going to have an eclipse of the sun. Or was it June 21 or June 22? Should've paid more attention in school. Guard! Guard! Sir Boss, what? What are you doing? What Sir Boss? What is it? Guard! What do you want, you little varlet? Tell Mordred and the rest of his cronies, if they try to so much as saute one finger of mine, I'm going to smother the world in eternal midnight. You wouldn't. Want to bet? I'm going to blot out the sun. It's never going to shine again. MAN: No, Sir Boss. - No, Sir Boss. Sir Boss, I pray you. You guys, I was just kidding. I'm just going to bot the sun out for a few minutes. What if Sir Boss was truthful about her threat to hold the sun's light? She has shown control over the elements only with her lightning box. Trust me, she is a fraud of the greatest proportions. I here perform the triple circle dance for protection. So [inaudible] hold your net, a pygmy to a giant. Sent forth the false wizard. I didn't know picking a lock was so difficult. I see it done 10, 20 times a night on cop shows. Cop shows? Something we have a lot of where I come from. Let me try, your majesty. Just wiggle it around until you hit all the right gizmos. Gizmos? Step forward, Sir Boss. Don't come near her. You will have to kill us first. We will. Stop. I'll go with you. But you're going to be sorry. I think. No, Sir Boss! Get back! MORDRED: Do you have any final words to say, Sir Boss? Yes. What time is it? 'Tis the hour of noon, and I predict bad weather only for you. Put her to the torch. Wait! You so much as try to take one step toward me, I'll blot out the sun, and you'll never have fresh vegetables even if your life depends on it-- which it does! Tie her to the stake. Why didn't I pay more attention in school? Why? [excited music] MAN: Look. Look there. All right! MAN: Well, that's strange. WOMAN: What is it? MAN: See how it moves? What we do now, Mother, dear? KAREN: I told you. I told you I'd blot out the sun. MAN: [inaudible] MORGANA: We kill her, we'll kill the spell. MAN: Stop her! MORGANA: Get her. [music intensifies] I'll cut your heart out with my own hands. Put me down! Mordred! Lancelot! Pretender. MAN: If I am to die-- Morgana. You fare sweet Guinevere, you are dead. QUEEN GUINEVERE: Kiai! WOMEN: [gasps] QUEEN GUINEVERE: That's for Sir Boss. MERLIN: Back, you little urchin. Come. Wait. Wait. I just. I'm not going to hurt-- I want to just talk to-- CLARENCE: Come on! Come on! This way. Wow. Great heavens. CLARENCE: Quick, come on! Faster! Quick! MERLIN: Sir Boss! Sir Boss, wait! CLARENCE: The sand bags, untie them, quick. MERLIN: Wait. Wait! All right, then. You leave me no choice. This-- this spell never fails. If I can't destroy you, I'll put you to sleep! I command you to sleep for hundreds of years! Hundreds of years! Sleep. Sleep. Close your eyes. You'll be in for a big surprise! [laughs] Hundreds of years! Hundreds of years! KAREN: Good bye, King Arthur. Good bye, Queen Guinevere and Lancelot. I'm going to miss you. KING ARTHUR: Good bye, Sir Boss. And thank you. [excited music] KAREN: Uh-oh. I guess you can't argue with destiny. [happy music] What's the matter? Merlin's spell. Merlin, he is a real magician. CLARENCE: Told you so. KAREN: He's after me. He's after me. He's after me. He's after me. LIZ: Karen. He's after me. He's after me. He's after me. Nobody's after you. KAREN: He's after me. He's after me. He's after me. LIZ: Nobody's after you. You fell off a horse. But Merlin's really after me. LIZ: Are you all right, Karen? Of course I'm OK. Then what's my name? If you don't know your name, I'm not going to tell you. I was so worried about you. You could have been killed. You don't even know half the story. Or at least you don't seem to have broken any bones. I was in Camelot, Liz. I met King Arthur, Queen Guinevere. You're going to need your head examined. I was Sir Boss. I had my own loft. But I almost got my head chopped off. I'm going to have to tell Mom about you borrowing a horse. No, you're not! Yes, I will. No, you can't. I'm going to tell her. She's going to blame me anyway, you know. No, she's not. I'm going to tell her it's all my fault. I can handle it. You must have banged your head harder than I thought. KAREN: It was an adventure! I met King Arthur and Queen Guinevere and Sir Lancelot. My best friend's name was Clarence. You'd have really liked him. He was definitely a page. Not a paragraph at all. [chuckles] [music playing]
