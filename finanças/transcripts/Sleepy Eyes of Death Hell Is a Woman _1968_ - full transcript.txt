Withdraw! Withdraw! From the Saeki Clan... I'm Tadokoro Genjiro... Please... take this to Chamberlain... Horii Unemenosho-sama. The letter that your people took was a fake. I don't care about the letter. I did what I was paid for. If you have the real letter, you should bring it to Chamberlain Inada Geki of the Saeki clan. You'll get money, a job, anything you want. I don't want anything at all. I see you have extraordinary skill. We'll meet again. What is this! The letter is a fake! A fake? How do you know that? The ronin said so... Ronin? Who is that? I don't know his name. But he has excellent sword skill. Are you sure that he has the real letter? Maybe. Knowing that, how could you come back here? "Kill Tadokoro Genjiro." That's all you told me. Find the real letter! Unemenosho will make a move, too. Do it as quickly as possible! He killed Tadokoro... and buried him, too? Yes. What a twisted ronin! What is his name? - He said Naruse Tatsuma. - Naruse Tatsuma? It may not be his real name. He's the one who took the letter. No, the other ronin took it. What? The other ronin? Be quiet! Give me the money! Here we go! I see... You really look different to be siblings. But I feel safe because of my younger brother. Sis! How many ri to the town of Saeki Castle? About 20 ri. (40 miles) - Are you going to Saeki? - Yes. I have to see somebody over there. Thank you very much! Oh, you ate them all already! Yes, I'm full. Let's go, Sis! Kid, protect your sister. Alright? Yes! Thank you very much for everything. Thank you, mister! Wait! Take this. How beautiful! Wow! You look so pretty! There. Well... It must be very expensive. Don't worry about it. You're worthy of having it. Sis! Take it. - I'll accept your gift, then. - Good. Thank you! - Sayonara! - Sayonara! Samurai-san, thank you very much! Sayonara! Sayonara! Sayonara! I've been waiting for you without your permission. Please forgive my rudeness. I'm very used to rude ambush attacks. I've been waiting to have you kill my enemy. Please... Please help me! Please do it for the sake of my brother. I can't do it. I kill people who would otherwise kill me. Killing someone as a favor to someone is not acceptable. My brother was an acquaintance of yours. Tadokoro Genjiro was his name. You're Tadokoro Genjiro's sister. It must have been fate for him to have met you. Nemuri-sama...! Please...! You really want me to kill your enemy? Yes. Will you do anything to kill your enemy? Yes! Then, I'll need to have your body. It's up to you to decide, since you brought up this business. Will you kill Naruse Tatsuma? The ronin's name is Naruse Tatsuma? Don't you regret losing the virginity you've been protecting... until today? Anything for my brother. How about for money? Your body can't lie about whether you've known men before or not! Pretending to be an innocent sister of Tadakoro Genjiro, but you must be a cheap actress! You can memorize lines for acting on stage, but you can't hide your true identity as a cheap actress! The cheap show is finished! Trying to use me saying you need an Adauchi(Revenge)... It was a bad plot! Please go home. I asked you to go home. I sincerely apologize from the bottom of my heart; you're right about everything. However, we desperately need your help. I refuse. Otherwise, we'll have to commit Hara Kiri in order to show our loyalty. Yes. We're working with Chamberlain Horii Unemenosho-dono to protect the Saeki Clan of 140,000 koku, from co-Chamberlain Inada Geki, who is rebelling against our government. If we had gotten there earlier, Tadokoro Genjiro would still be alive. Please listen to us! If we don't act now, Inada Geki will try to take over our clan! Nemuri-dono! Please! Please help us! I have no intention of helping anybody. But I'll say this one thing. The letter the ronin took from Tadokoro-dono was a fake. Then, you have the real letter? I don't have it. - Where is it? - I don't know. But I'm sure that Chamberlain Inada Geki doesn't have it. Well, two street performers. The girl is about seventeen and the boy is about eight. Oh yes. They came by a little after noon. After noon? Did they do something to bother you? Oh, no. I'm the one who might have created a problem. Oh... Welcome! - Sak√©! - Yes. Wait! How long does it take to get to the town of Saeki Castle? It's about 15 ri. Fifteen ri...? Then, I'll have dinner. I'm afraid I don't have any decent fare here. Decent fare? I don't need it. Pickled vegetables and a lot of rice. Yes. What an excellent sword you have. But... But it has a design of a very dark spirit. That's right. It can't help but bring misfortune to the sword's owner. Yes. I know that. By the way, are you going to Saeki Castle town? No. The Saeki Clan lord, Echigo-no-kami is bedridden with a terrible illness. Because of this, two principal retainers are fighting over the shift in power... and making the whole clan shake from its roots. For ronin like us, don't you think this is the perfect opportunity? One is the Chamberlain Inada Geki, the other is Chamberlain Horii Unemenosho. There's no telling who'll be the winner in the end. But I'll support Unemenosho. See, I even have a letter for him. Thank you for waiting. If you want to, I don't mind adding your name to this letter. Do you mind if I join you? Where are you going? I don't know... Where are you going? I'm in a hurry... Your lame foot is inconveniencing me. Hey! Hold on! Do you hear me? My brother... is trying to kill our father... What? Your brother kill your father? Don't let him... Please... What's your brother's name? What is his name? Na... "CHIKA" "Princess Sayo has escaped from Edo Castle... "She is headed toward her home town... "See to this matter." What a poor girl... Who was she? She was just a street performer. But why did she end up like this? It's my fault... I killed them! - What is it? - Thatman. I feel like I've seen him somewhere before. Hey! I'm pretty sure that man is Princess Sayo. How could that be our princess? Besides, she was alone. There's no mistake. Soon it will be night. The inn will be the only place she can stay tonight. I'm being followed by criminals. Please hide me in here. Perhaps staying here is more dangerous. I see a woman only as sexual object. Go away. I see you as a real samurai. Please take me to the town of Saeki Castle. Saeki? You're the one, aren't you? Go away. What kind of show are you starting now? Oh! I'm terribly sorry. Thank you very much. I didn't do anything. I'm a daughter of Saeki Echigo-no-kami, Princess Sayo. Please take me to the town of Saeki. I'll reward you in any way you like. If you're looking for a job... Stop! You think all ronin will wag their tails when you mention a job? Please forgive me. I have to get back to my castle as soon as possible... to protect my father in his bed... from his two Chief retainers, Horii and Inada. Please... Take me to the castle! I've had enough. Helping a princess protect her clan. That's nonsense. - Then, you won't help me? - Correct. I'm lost. Let me stay tonight. How much do you have? How much do you have? About 20 ryo. Then, two ryo. Are you serious? If you like... you can stay for a year, even two years. Women around here are famous for their kindness. You must be very kind to men. Woman, what kind of trap have you prepared for me? Kill him! Withdraw! Withdraw! If you don't mind, I'd like to help you. - Please. - No! I don't need your help. I'd be embarrassed if you take my hand. - Please leave me alone. - No. If you join me it would be very helpful for me, too. It's inconvenient for a woman to travel alone. Besides, I'm lost and don't know what to do. Well then, I believe I've found a cane. Please forgive me. It seems like you were in deep sorrow. Since I couldn't sleep, I went out to see the moon. The moon? It was so beautiful. I became very calm after watching the moon for a while. You seem like a married woman. My husband passed away six months after I married. Were you crying because you miss... your dead husband? I can hold you if you want... or I can fall asleep. I smell a man on your body. Is your man a good fighter? Your man must be an expert... with the sword if he plans on killing me. It's so unfortunate for him... that my eyesight came back. Why do you want to kill me? I have to support Unemenosho..! You no longer can get involved in your clan's power struggles. From now on, you'll be your husband's cane. Why are you preventing me from going to my castle? Why don't you understand that I must hurry to save my father? Can't you see I'm worried about my father and came from afar? Do you truly want to see your father from your heart? There's a true bond of love between my father and myself! And perhaps a true bond of hatred between father and son. Princess, how old are you now? Why do you want to know my age? Geki! Take me to the castle immediately! Don't be in such a hurry. Why not? Our lord is surrounded by Unemenosho's retainers. Your entering the castle would be... the most ideal situation for Unemenosho. Holding our lord and princess in his hands, The 140,000 koku of the Saeki clan... will be under Unemenosho's total control. In the worst case, they might try to kill our lord. That is why our princess needs... this Geki, to protect her in any way possible. Oh, you came. I knew we'd meet again. Sit down here. Let's drink together. I prefer to drink alone. I prefer to drink with someone. Good. Let's drink together. People say I can drink like a horse. I have some money to take care of you. You shouldn't spend a lot. You see... I might work for a chamberlain. Congratulations to you. It's still a little too early for that. But this city seems like a heaven for ronin. Including him? What? He looks depressed. Three flasks of cold sak√©. He drinks them like water and then takes off. He doesn't know how to drink. He might not know how to be with a woman. Poor guy. But he's said to have excellent sword skill. Inada-sama paid him 100 ryo. What? Geki paid him 100 ryo? It's too late if you came to sell the letter. The princess is with us now. Is that man a friend of yours? He probably came to work for Unemenosho. Hey! Come outside! It's been a while since I last enjoyed drinking sak√©. I said come out! You're not so smart, are you? It was your fault that you got fired! Why don't you contemplate your sword skill that got you fired. I'll let you know how good my sword skill is! - Hey, guys! - Yes! - Dump his body outside! - Yes! - Yes! His sword, too! I'm sorry about that. Let's drink again. Thanks. But I drink only 3 flasks. Besides, I don't like people buying my sak√©. What snobby customers are in here! Now, more than ever, I insist you drink my sak√©. He won't pay me up front but he wants me to work. I'll pay for it next time. Well... Did that surprise you? Not at all. Not only women, but ronin, too can be sold in this town. Are you for sale, too? No, I'm not. I'm looking for someone. Looking for someone? I want to meet... the woman you're looking for. It's a man. A man? For Adauchi...? Is 100 koku not enough for you? They're well trained samurai. One young ronin has especially good skills. I don't think it's worth putting my life on the line for 100 koku. How much do you need? Three hundred koku, plus an officer's position within the clan. No! Who do you think you are? I know myself very well. I'm worth 300 koku. You don't even have to weigh on your scale whether 140,000 koku is worth 300 koku. Reporting, sir! A ronin named Nemuri Kyoshiro is here to see you. Nemuri Kyoshiro? Is that a man? I'm Horii Unemenosho. Why do you so urgently need to see me? A few days ago, I saw one of your retainers, Tadokoro Genjiro, just before he died. He gave me his last will. So I came to see you. Well, what did he say to you? Winner. Make him the winner, Unemenosho-sama. "Winner?" What does it mean? If you don't know it, how should I know? Is that all? When I passed your house, I wanted to see your face with my own eyes. My face..? Then? As I thought I would, I see death in your face. A death that you can't avoid. Is it a threat? Or are you trying to give me a bad time? Take it however you like. Bye. Well... I need 10 ryo up front. You won't work if you're already paid. Ten ryo is preparation for big work. No! Nemuri Kyoshiro is famous for his "Full Moon" cut. I've heard that no one has ever beat it. Are you saying that you can kill him? Yes. However, I insist that I need 500 koku. - 500 koku? - Indeed. I'd like you to put it in writing... that I will have 500 koku... and an official post after my work is done. I believe that Kyoshiro works for Unemenosho. I heard that Kyoshiro... is an excellent samurai warrior. Yes, we've already been beaten by him. Tatsuma! Can you kill Nemuri Kyoshiro? Where is he? Until now, you've probably never thought about being killed. Of course not! A man who kills with a sword will be killed by a sword. Death is never on my mind. It sounds beautiful. But death is never beautiful. It's rather painful. You have to struggle with pain until death comes. I'll never die until I've completed my goal. I knew someone was behind me, but I couldn't take my eyes off of you for even a second. Well... Did I kill him for you? Thank you! Thank you very much! Thank you very much! Thank you! Here! Thank you! Here is your pay! Thank you! "A ronin and street performers...." It sounds like fiction. Watching the boy with a smile, Then guarding yourself with steel. Which one is the true you? Both of them are true. Don't get too close to me anymore. Why? All the women who got involved with me have met with misfortune. Well, I decide whether I'm fortunate or not. Where are you going? Samurai-sama! Please take this. Please read it quickly. "Please help me. Princess Sayo." Please, this way. This is the place. Please, here! Help me, please! Help me, please..! Did you find the man? Then, you'll leave soon from the city. Hold me. Having relations tonight doesn't mean we'll be together in the future. You came as a wind and you'll go as a wind. But please go when I'm not here... Forgive me. Pardon my rudeness. Finally, I got some money up front. It's only five ryo. Anyway, let's drink all night together. Hey, bring sak√©! Besides, I've got an offer of 500 koku in here. Look at this. It's because of you, and I really appreciate it. My luck is going up, and I'll negotiate until it's 1,000 koku. "Kill Nemuri Kyoshiro" is my sales pitch. You must make a deal for 500 koku. What? - You can't kill me. - I can! The Full Moon Style. Are you going to beat it with a cheap sword? You knew it already. Please go ahead! He wants me to work like an ant! - Hurry! - I see. I see. It's for my 1,000 koku offer. It's nice to welcome you. But I'll take the princess! The princess! The princess is taken! Useless! After we worked so hard to get the princess, you let them steal her. Sir! I told you we have more enemies than just Unemenosho! Find her! - Find her any way you can! - Sir! Don't worry. This house belongs to a friend of Otoyo. Well... Would you take me to the castle? It isn't my intention to save you. I can't tolerate people pretending to be faithful government officials, but instead they're using it to control power for their own selfish purposes. Then, what should I do now? You have to find your own way. I so regret having been born into the Saeki clan. If that's your destiny, you have to follow it. If I can't see my father, I'd rather die in here. It's your choice. But people are born to live. People can't die if it's not their time. You have to live, even if your life is full of pain. Did you say 500 koku is not worth it? Yes, I did. Now, more than ever, the situation has become critical. Critical? Correct. The enemy is very strong. Especially, Nemuri Kyoshiro, an exceptional swordsman. - Jinnai. - Yes. Kill Geki. Can you kill Kyoshiro, too? Would you rewrite the contract to 1,000 koku? Can you kill him? Kill or be killed. It really depends on fate. What do you think of this? I'll give you a really good price. Say, 10 ryo for this. How much is this? That's three ryo. But that cheap sword is not for you, Samurai-san. Don't worry. My skill will cover the seven ryo difference. Now, we have only one way to win this war. We have to break Unemenosho's barrier, get our lord back out, and start using his name to control our territory! Go hurry and prepare. Who cares about the clan's power struggle? Did you fall in love with Princess Sayo? People sometimes do things they never imagined they'd do. Stop. Please... don't do anything more. But you don't listen to me. It's alright. I won't say anything. It's cold tonight. Maybe it will snow. You're also the same. All the women who care for me end up in misfortune. That's a lie! I'm so happy. My body is full of joy. Hold me... tight! I won't make it... It's alright... Otoyo! Do you work for Unemenosho? I was told... that I must kill you... But... I'm glad... Because I could not kill myself... Otoyo! Hold on! I'm so sorry... I don't want you to have her... "Show me your Full Moon Cut. I'll be waiting at the lake." I regret that we never had the chance to drink sak√© together. Not to be drawn to your sword. The only way to beat your Full Moon Cut... is to avoid being drawn to your sword. Three ryo is three ryo anyway. Now, we don't have any reason to fight with you. Then, you'd better leave this town now. I don't need your opinion! Since Inada Geki was killed, you don't have a reason to stay here. I do. My reason for staying here is just beginning. If you accomplish your purpose, you'll be facing unbearable misfortune. Unbearable misfortune... My mother was like that. She worked at a mansion and became pregnant by the master. Then, cast away... "Don't kill Horii Unemenosho." Those were the last words of Ochika. Ochika. Did she die? She died in my arms. She tried to stop you from killing your father and was killed by Geki's samurai en route to the city. Geki's samurai? Why was Ochika killed by Geki? Well... I gave Ochika the scarf that Tadokoro Genjiro had. That led to Ochika's death. That's why I came to see you. Tatsuma! Fulfill Ochika's wish! Then, if you want to, you can kill me. The fact is, Ochika was killed by Unemenosho! I'll kill Unemenosho, my very own father! If we take the princess to the castle, everything will be perfect! - Congratulations, sir. - Yes. Hold. Kyoshiro, your work has ended in vain. But take it as good fortune that you're still alive. Oh, that's the same family Mon as ours. - Is that all you can say about this? - What else is there to say? The children of yours, Naruse Tatsuma and Ochika. Their pain and sadness is in these. That will teach them that they have to learn who they are. I'm busy preparing to escort Princess Sayo to the castle tomorrow. I don't have time for that kind of thing! You'd better delay the princess' trip to the castle. Nonsense! My dream comes true tomorrow after getting the princess to the castle. Naruse Tatsuma will attack the parade to the castle. Impossible. He will attack, no matter what! You... You came to save me? I don't care what happens to you. However, I don't want Tatsuma to kill his own father. That's all. But how can we prevent that...? There is a way. You! Withdraw! Tatsuma! Unemenosho? Withdraw! Tatsuma! Unemenosho? Unemenosho? You..! I'll kill you! I have to kill anyone who gets in my way. Die! You! Even the Full Moon Cut can't beat a gun. Throw down your sword! Throw it! Then, your short sword also. Hold it! I've never killed anyone who wanted to be killed! Even my wish to die won't come true. Tatsuma... Tatsuma...! Tatsuma, I'm the one who killed Unemenosho. Do you understand? Wait! Nemuri-sama! Thank you very much. Because of you, our Saeki clan will be... This villain has nothing to do with the Saeki clan. Nemuri-sama... I will never forget what you did for us! Please go. THE END
