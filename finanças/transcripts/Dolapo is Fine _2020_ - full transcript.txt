(girls chatter, giggle) Imogen: Dollop, what you think of my hair today? Dolápò: Yeah, it's nice! I like it like this. You should have it like this more often. Imogen: I really want Liam to like it. Dolápò: You're still thinking about Liam. You need to focus on yourself. (both laughing) Imogen: Who's this woman you're meeting today? Daisy. She's really successful. She'll probably, like, give me some tips, mentor me, get me into a firm or something. Dollop, that's so good! -Dolápò: I'm gonna smash it. -Imogen: Yeah, you are. -Okay. -(bell ringing) Right. I need to go 'cause I'm gonna be late. -Bye. -Good luck.

Uh, my name is Dolápò, but you can call me Dollop. I'm really inspired by your work. It's a real honor to have this time with you. Do you introduce yourself to people as Dollop? No one can pronounce Dolápò. Nobody can pronounce Adaeze, but that doesn't mean I call myself Dazed. I say, "Hi. "My name is Adaeze, but you can call me Daisy." Try again. Go out and come back in. Hi, my name is Dolápò, but you can, um... you can... Hi, my name is Dolápò, but you can call me Dolly. Take a seat, Dolly. My first question is why do you want to work in finance? Okay, so I've been thinking about this a lot lately, and... I signed up to help young girls like yourself, so take this as it's meant, Dolly. With the best intentions. Your hair is not suitable to work in the city. Assimilation first. Sorry, I-- Well, that afro is fine if you want to work in fashion. My friends like it. White friends or Black? -Does it really matter? -White or Black. -Mostly white. -(soft chuckle) They think you're "cool," don't they? Right. Let's get on with the mock interview. Tell me about a scenario where you showed leadership. (sighs) -(girls laughing) -(music playing) Dolápò: That is horrible. -Get this one. -No, it's blonde. -Beyoncé dyes her hair blonde sometimes. -It's not her real hair. Really? What is it? What about... (sighs) -This one. -Imogen: It has a fringe. I don't think a fringe would suit your face, Dollop. Calling myself Dolly now. I can't keep up with you. Well, I don't think a fringe will suit your face, Dolly. Ooh! What about this one? Ah! I think this one would be perfect. (groans) Although, I don't see why you have to buy a wig in the first place. My hair's curly, too, and I don't need a wig. Stop talking, Imogen.

I wouldn't wanna work anywhere that made me change my hair. Then I'll never have a job. I'm not you. My family can't just walk me into employment. That is so unnecessary, Dollop. It's not like your parents don't have money. It's Dolly now. -Where are you going? -I have work to do. (music playing on computer) (phone ringing) (ringing stops) -Hello? -Daisy (on phone): Dolly? It's Daisy. I have some questions for you. What do you think of the falling oil prices? I don't know. Daisy: You have to be sharper than this. Make sure you look at the financial pages. They need to believe in you. Have you styled your hair? Um, I was wondering, do you know where it comes from? Is it Brazil? Daisy: More likely from some poor girl's head in India. What does it matter? Be serious, Dolly, and tell me the difference between a stock and a bond. Um... Uh... (sighs) Uh, wait... Daisy: No, no, no.
