Did you think you wouldn't recognize me? - You never know. I parked that way. You don't have your convertible anymore? - I do, but Hella drives it. How is she? - I think she's doing well. What's this? I took it out. You have to sit in the back. Have you seen him yet? No, we're going there together now. Doesn't Manni have a wife who can take care of him? No idea. Manni and his women. You know how secretive he always was. Bernhard is there already. - Are you still in touch? Bernhard, yeah, but I kind of lost contact to Manni. And how is he? - Oh, real bad. Listen, Harry. It's best I tell you this right now. Yeah? - I have to go back tomorrow. You have to go back tomorrow!? - Yes, I'm sorry, there's no other way. I don't have time to take care of Manni. Please. You have to do it. You and Bernhard. You can't be serious. Yes? What's up? Listen, I have a terrible connection. You have to speak directly into the telephone, please. No, I can't go somewhere else. We're in a traffic jam in some kind of tunnel. No, no, no. Yeah. Bye. My ex. Cleo, my oldest, suddenly had the great idea to join some ritzy hockey club. And if she's allowed, then of course the others will want something too. Hey, look at this. My new watch. Did you see it yet? To die for. - It's exact to a hundredth of a second. And even has an eternal calendar. - Unbelievable all the crap you can buy. Excuse me. Olli! Yes, I received it. Yeah, hold on. I have it here. Yes, I just didn't have time to look at it. Qlli? Qlli? Olli?! Ah, there you are. - Harry. Justus. - Bernie. Where is he? - He's sleeping. Then we'll wake him up, huh? Listen, I don't have anything for him. A present or something. Do you? Manni. Manni? Look who's here. Manni. How about this for the kids? A puzzle from Bernie. Very educational, right Bernie? You don't mind if I give it to Justus do you? No, please. Four daughters... What a gift. Look. It's new. It's exact to the hundredth of a second. And look, it has an eternal calendar. You know what? I'll give it to you. You can't even make phone calls with that watch, Manni. Can it at least take photos? Hm? Oh, well. Well, you have your Ferrari now, huh? Yes, you always wanted a Ferrari, and now it's right out front. You're the only one of us who could afford something like that. That's why I never went on vacation, and have no children. Can you still remember that accident? It's a miracle nothing happened back then. Normally no one would survive an accident like that. The way we ran through the field. Totally euphoric. And totally stoned. The 24 hours after the accident were the best in my life. The way we talked about the future all night long. My God, all the things we were going to do. Well, we should have stayed together. Oh, sorry. You can still remember that night, right? - Yes, of course. Listen, I'd like to ask you something. Go ahead. Could you do me a favor? Yes, of course. Anything you want. Can you get Rosie? Rosie? Yeah. Yes, Bernie, Rosie. I'd like to see her again. Can you bring her here? Maybe she's not around anymore. Nonsense. I just wonder where she went. I could never find her again. Where did you look for her? In Switzerland? Why? Excuse me. You can't use your mobile phone in here. Sorry, I have to call you back, okay? Are you okay? It's just because of my friend. He's here in this ward. It's because of the radiation. It's really not good. I wrote her letters. They all came back. Address unknown. Do you think you can manage to find her? Do you need anything, Manni? Can we get something for you? I never saw her again after we broke up. Didn't talk to her once. Rosie. I just want to know how she is. I mean, I'm sure she's still alive. It's only been ten years. I hope she'll forgive me. That was really crappy of you. What? - To give him your watch. He was happy about it! You just did that because you felt helpless. To pity a friend like that just means that you already gave up on that person. You're the ones who are helpless. I treated him like a human being and not like some weird creature that is going to disappear into space in two days. If |I was dying and someone gave me a watch, I'd take it as an insult. Are you giving me a hard time now? - Come on, just admit it. That's an absurd present for someone who is almost dead. I don't know. I don't see him like that. Oh, so you think he's just a bit hung over? He was happy about it. I could tell! I'll put Manni's car in the garage now. Really? Is he scared someone might scratch the paint? What else did he want from you? Oh, nothing in particular. But for some reason he sent Harry and me out of the room. Come on, tell us. I think Manni kind of regrets becoming an actor. What? Why? Yeah, he told me on the phone once. He said, "Justus, you won't believe it, but I'm a man with nothing." What? But he had everything. Money, women... everything. Bliss. He says he thinks he threw too much away. Too many good things. Threw them away? Maybe he thinks he missed out on the most important things in life because of his vanity. - Well then he realized that too late. No, no. Manni wasn't vain. He was just too impatient to really let someone get close to him. When things got uncomfortable and he wasn't having fun anymore, then he just took off. - Now leave Manni alone. Oh yeah, then he asked me about a film we made together once. What film? It was about girls on Kurfiirstendamm. We filmed how Manni talked to young women on Kurflirstendamm. I think we made the first underground film, even before Andy Warhol. I'll tell you what they did, Bernie. They made a porno. Yeah, yeah. Come on, let's get out of here. If I was Manni, I'd just get in the jalopy and kill myself in a crash. But you're not Manni. And besides Manni is way too weak to drive. You could drive and kill the both of you in a crash. That might at least shut you up. Maybe I'd say yes. Now I'm happy, how I can die. Bernhard, he's making stupid jokes. I'm not making stupid jokes. I think you have to be happy when you die. To die unhappy... that sucks. How old is the average Ferrari driver? 56. Times two. You have to be sensitive to drive this vehicle. Oh really? Then you're the wrong driver. What's up with the rain? - I'm leaving that one alone. Ah here. The formula one switch. It automatically turns off if the tires have too little... Yeah, yeah. There he goes again with his whole three months of an auto repair class. Now watch out. Alright... Here we go. Don't go crazy man. Come on in. Everything here is pretty run down. We should plan something. Plan what? - To do something with Manni. No answer. What do you think about taking him to the next Hertha game at Olympia stadium? Come on, you can't be serious. There's not a single photo of her here. Hello, my name is Lenz. I'm sorry to disturb you, but I'm looking for a Ms. Diesel. Rosemarie Diesel. No. Uh huh. Yes. Thank you. What do you think became of her? Rosie was pretty unique. You could never tie Rosie down. Why are you looking at me like that? You don't want to find her, right? Why wouldn't I want to find her? Because there was something between you two. And now you're embarrassed to see her again. The other way around. You had an affair with her. She never loved Manni. Well, she wasn't that great either. She was a queen. Serious and proud. Need to talk now. Lo. Hello, my name is Lenz. I'm looking for a Ms. Diesel. Rosemarie Diesel. You have to aim. Try to hit me, Bernie. Aim, Bernie. Aim. But say, why don't you want anything to do with Rosi? Practice a little bit more. Okay, so we'll try to find her former friend Iris, and you go check the university registrar. At some point she was a student. What did Manni really want from you before? It wasn't really about the old film, was it? - No, it was about something religious. Religious? He wanted to know if I thought there could be something else after death. If God exists. About the future, so to say. He said I was the only one of us he could talk to about something like that. You know, Harry... I was never so good with emotions. I never knew how to express myself, feelings-wise. You know, and the only thing that I could think of was to go by foot. I understand. I even did a pilgrimage. I walked over 600 kilometers. I don't believe it. Yes. Good. Great. He found her! I'm going to walk. It's on the eleventh floor, Bernard! You didn't think we'd find her that fast, did you? I'd have guessed she lived abroad. At least in France or something. She always wanted to go to Paris. I don't see anything. She's not there. So tell me Harry, have you and Hella separated? Are you having an affair or are you living alone? Come on, tell me. I can't be alone. I never could. You and Hella have been together already 15 years now. Ten, Justus, ten. Lately Hella keeps talking something about continuity. Continuity? - Yes. She thinks continuity is somehow more important than any big dreams or ideas. Well. I used to think women like Hella are too exhausting. But then I realized that they are actually a relief for a man. A relief? - They take care of a lot of things. They become like men themselves. Just a little bit. Bernhard. Why are you always carrying that stupid bag around with you? We thought we'd at least bring her some flowers to greet her. But don't panic. She's not home. So, who's going to wait for her? Stay here. Not me. Let's go to that recreation center down there. Come on. Hello, Lo. I wanted to call you as well. No, we're out and about. We have to take care of something for our sick friend. I'm sorry, I can't unfortunately. Okay. Of course. Yeah, good. Then let's meet up later. Hey, Bernhard, did Harry tell you already? No. You can tell him yourself. I'm just about to, you moron. I can't stay as long as I wanted to. I have so much going on. Everyday it's some new shit. Oh, for God's sake, it can't be that bad. Have you forgotten that I have two women and four children to feed? So what? We all have two women. What's up? Well? Didn't you want to play against me? Ping pong? What? You can't play a civilized game of tennis at your age. First I'm going to have a beer. - I ordered a water. Yes, my friend, I haven't had any alcohol for six months now. Ever since I met Lo. Lo? She might come by here later. If she has time. She's very busy. Three waters for the gentlemen. Here you are. Thanks. Thank you. So you're just going to bail out on us. Come on, don't make such a big deal out of it. There are two of you. Then Manni won't see you again. You didn't say good bye to him, did you? He doesn't know that you're not coming back. Don't you leave now too, Bernie. He's checking on Rosie. How about it? A beer? Where is he? Ah, look. There she is. Hello? Yes. Yes... What?! Are you out of your mind? No, that's out of the question. No, I won't do it! No way. A journalist. He wants me to write an obituary for Manni. An obituary? He's not even dead yet. She's not back yet. Why do you think she's not at home? Because she's at some guy's house, what else? A present from my wife. For our tenth anniversary. She gave me an ultimatum. Who? Hella? No, Lo! What kind of ultimatum? She wants me to decide. Between her and Hella. By tomorrow. She won't put up with it any longer. Why can't it just stay the way it is? It's ideal. Yes? We found her, yes. No, she's not at home. We're waiting in front of her house. Yeah, good. Okay, sure. Manni. He wants us to come to the hospital. - To the hospice? Now? Right now. She refused, didn't she? She doesn't want to see me. No, Manni. We just didn't catch her at home. Come on, Bernie. You can tell me. I can deal with the truth. Ask the others. Harry! Harry? And this works too. Ah, hold on. Okay. This works too. Get up for a minute, Bernie. Shake my hand like normal. Now you. Should I stay standing? - No, you can sit down again. One more time. I said just normal. Can't you just simply shake someone's hand? What? Now you. - And? I've heard that men with a firm handshake are untrustworthy. And why? - They have something to hide. And what? A weakness. Because they have a certain weakness to hide. Oh, really? I heard a different story. Oh, yeah, what? Men with a firm handshake have a small dick. Nonsense. Then I'd have a thing like this. It's true. Nonsense, I have a real little one. Whose turn is it? - Bernie. Oh, yeah. Okay. Like this, yes? Class essays. About what? About the beginning. About the beginning. Yes, that's the theme of my students who'll be leaving school soon and have to go out into the world. And Mr. teacher, what do your students write about? Almost all the boys write about sex. The last time I slept with a woman was about a year ago. If only I'd known it was the last time! But how could I have known? It was the last time. Second day She's gone again. Hello, Rosie. Oh, you guys. Did you two get lost? No, no. Sorry about the surprise visit. But we have to talk to you, you know. It's urgent. Why, what happened? Bernhard. They're from Manni. From Manni? No, no. Tell him to leave me alone. No, you know what? Don't tell him anything. Just tell him that you didn't catch me at home. Exactly. Tell him that. Bernhard, did you understand me? Rosie! Rosie, Manni is not doing so well. He'd like to talk to you again. For the last time. Rosie! I'll find a way. Up until now I've been able to afford every kind of car. I had an old MG, a jeep, an Alfa Romeo, a Triumph, a Porsche, a Jaguar. And my big dream is to have a Ferrari. As soon as I have the money, I'm going to buy myself a Ferrari. I'll immediately use all the money to buy myself this car. 60,000 Deutschmarks. That's a lot of money. Others build an existence for themselves from that or a house... Unfortunately I'm really crazy. I want to have that car. Only a few are destined to have this car and I hope that I belong to those few. I didn't recognize her at all, at first. She won't come along. What do we do now? Just leave it? Let's say we didn't catch her at home. She left town to an unknown destination. I'll try again alone. Bernhard. You can't just refuse like that, Rosie. It's his last wish. You'll blame yourself your whole life, if you don't go. He should come here himself, if he wants something from me. He can't leave the hospital anymore. Harry, yes. Come up. She doesn't want to come. - I figured that. She has a dentist appointment later. That's just an excuse. I'll talk to her again. Where is she? And? She's embarrassed... - Embarrassed? Why? She's scared to open her mouth. Because she lost her front tooth. Do you have a smoke? - You have to ask Bernhard. I quit. In the glove compartment. Thanks. It's great to see you again. After such along time. You don't say. So, is Manni really doing so bad or is this just one of his usual tricks? Listen Rosie, if someone has cancer in the final stage, then everything is different. People aren't the same as they used to be. Listen Rosie, there is one last chance. We want to take Manni to an alternative cancer center in Shanghai. I have a colleague who the German doctors had already given up... Bernhard, could you please stop the car. Just a second, I have to... Okay. Rosie! Rosie! So where is this dentist we're looking for? Next left, then right. Hey, Manni. Hello! Hello, Rosie. Hello. Please sit down. So, I'll leave you two alone. You can stay here. You don't have to leave. I'll be right back. Thanks for coming. I'm glad you are here. I am too. It wasn't so easy to find her. Let's go out to the patio. It's nicer out there. Hey Bernhard, didn't Britt play hockey? No, you're mixing something up. That was Elizabeth, my first wife. Actually we weren't really married. She didn't want to get married. At least not to me. No, Britt ran marathons until she hurt her knee. Somehow I thought that one of your wives was in a hockey club. Did you all know Harry was a champion in surfing? Oh man, you always say that. I wasn't a champion. You were always training for something. - No, I never trained. But talk to Manni. He was always training. He even put one of those ridiculously expensive goal keeper training machines in his yard. That was ages ago. I was still a bit crazy back then. It didn't help, he always blocked the difficult shots and let the easy ones in. We lost most of the games because of you. Did you ever play sports, Rosie? No, only soccer. - Soccer? You used to play soccer? But not out of solidarity to him? No, with my brothers and later in a women's team or group. We had a group called 'world literature'. We read all kinds of books and when we had enough we went out and played soccer. And what did you read? It's ancient history. It doesn't matter anymore. I'd like to know too. You? Really? Yes. Here, my sports friends. The last one I think was 'War and Peace' by Tolstoy, but we never finished it. Ah, I always wanted to read that. What is it about, actually? Justus. - Come on, tell me. About a failed relationship and its new beginning. Listen Manni, a colleague of mine who was also very sick... She recently flew to China. They have a brand new alternative therapy there. No, no, thank you. I don't want that. No way. Do you understand? It's enough. It's just enough. How are you? Good. Really? I'm okay. We don't have to talk if you don't want to. We can just sit here for a bit. Listen, Manni. Do you want to go home? We'll get you out of here and take care of you. I talked to the doctor. There's this team... - Bernhard, please just leave me be. You don't even know what you'd be getting yourself into. The very thought of one of you wiping my ass. Maybe it was all too much for her. She's reserved. When she's been around people for too long, she sometimes has to retreat and fill the emptiness inside. Do you want some champagne? No offense, but I'd like to be alone now. We should definitely try again to get him home. We can't just leave him here. Why is she making such a big deal out of it? Because it is a big deal. - Nonsense. Then she should just act like... Forgiving someone is one of the hardest things there is between two people. But it was ages ago when he left her. - Maybe ten years is a really long time. But the wound is not healed, and besides she left him. Really. Why? Rosie... does Manni have any distant relatives? No, I don't think so. He asked me to make sure that we burn... his personal things. He said that? He doesn't want them to end up at some trashy flea market. Who's going to get the Ferrari? We're not going to burn it, are we? I have to go now or I'll miss my plane. You're really pale. You have to eat something. It's probably your blood sugar level. You haven't eaten anything all day. Come on, what's wrong? - No, I just have to hurry. It's a bit much all at once. - Is there a will, Bernie? What's wrong with you? Good bye. And take care of yourself. Come on. Ciao. Take care. Yeah? Okay. It was Justus. He forgot to turn off the pool at Manni's bungalow. Justus, nice. Tell me, Rosie. Do you know if Manni still owns the bungalow? He tried to sell it once. Why did he want to sell this beautiful house? Because we wanted to move away together. He wasn't able to sell it because a brothel moved in the villa across the street. Of course then the property values dropped in the neighborhood. If you flirt with me one more time, there will be trouble. Gato Barbieri, Harry. Did you know that he buried the Porsche back there? But, why? He was a bit nuts. He buried everything that was over. You're such beautiful men. Give me the joint, please. Harry found Manni's ape costume. What ape costume? You stupid monkey, you. Bernie! For me a Ferrari was a childhood dream. At the end of the day, the ultimate fulfillment. The last thing that a person can ever have. What comes after a Ferrari? At most a jet or some kind of rocket. As I said, only a few are chosen and I hope that I belong to those few. Do you think it's his charm or his car that attracts girls? It depends on the girls. I'd say that on the one hand it's his charm, but on the other hand a lot of it is his car. Honestly, I usually just like to be around people who don't have money and don't own fast cars. 1 really don't care if people have fast cars and money. As long as I have enough money for myself, as long as I have enough money for cigarettes and to go out, I'm content. Just because I always drive crazy cars doesn't make me a playboy. With certain girls it happens really fast. You just have to be clever.. You can tell them the silliest things. You just have to be clever and charming and then they'll get in. I think that a lot of girls today pay attention to cars... Hey, check it out. Manni as a cut rate Marlon Brando. But I always try to differentiate, and I always know right away if a girl just means the car and not me. But it's just to play around. To try things out. 1 only feel happy driving in my car. I can leave everything behind. When I'm speeding over some highway. But at heart, I'm always looking for something. Rosie? Where is she? No idea. She found her old love letters to Manni. Oh shit. We should take Manni home nonetheless. How am I supposed to pay for what may turn out to be six months of round-the-clock care... You never know. For Manni, that asshole. Watching this old film makes me sick. -Why? I sold out. You know what I am, Bernard? Yeah? No? A stupid money making machine that just produces money. But you did it for your kids. Can I tell you something? I have no idea why I even have kids at all. I think I did it without even thinking about it. I think I had them just because it was possible. Or because I wanted to know if it was possible. It is possible. And maybe it's impossible to do it right in the end. What are you doing here? Oh, nothing. Are you okay? We'd hang out here when it got too boring over there. Can you hold me for a second? Do you love me? I love you. (send to: Lo + Hella) Third day Bernhard. Oh, God. Bernie, we have to get up. Get up. Hella and Lo. Now they both left me. Yes? Yes. Yes. Manni? Yeah, sure. Okay. He's coming out. - He's coming home? No, he wants us to bring him to Rosie's. Your wife. Hello, Britt. - Hello, Harry. Do you want some coffee? He hasn't come home for two nights. - Yes... We're all a bit mixed up. Right, Harry? Where is he? - He went to get something for Manni. But, his car is outside. - Yes... He wasn't at school. He's never done that before. He hasn't missed a single day in ten years. We'll tell Bernhard that you were here, then he'll call you right away. We have to go now. We have to meet Manni. There you are, Bernie. - Bernhard. You're still here. We have to leave. Yes, I know. What's wrong with you? Justus already said that we're all a bit sad. It's an unusual situation. Do you think it was a good idea to come here in person? Don't you believe me? You were so strange on the phone. I have a confession to make, Britt. No, please stay. I don't love you. It isn't love. I'm with you... because you're nice. That's okay, I don't love you either. But I like you and that's enough. It's always worked out quite nicely. And another thing. I'm staying here with Manni as long as he needs me. Day and night. I'm going to take him home. And one more thing, I'm going to quit teaching. For good. You're just saying that because you're depressed. I'm not saying it just because of that. I'm starting anew. I had forgotten that you can start anew. You can always start anew. I'm driving. - Let me drive for once. No. - You're going to let me drive now. I'm driving. - Stop it. I'm driving today. Okay, then let Bernhard drive. He wants to start a new life. So, you're driving. - So. And now... - This ought to be interesting. Where do you put the key? At least Bernhard and Harry have families. Yes, but two people aren't a family. It's just a constellation. A constellation that will fail sooner or later due to a lack of respect or what do I know. Why did you stay alone? Because I no longer wanted someone knowing everything about me. I no longer want to have to explain myself. You want to stay... a secret? Do you seriously want to die that way? What for? That would mean... that no one really knew you. Did you never really show yourself to someone? If I ever showed myself, then it was when I was with you. You know more about me than any other person. Yes, I had the feeling sometimes... that I knew you. There were moments when I felt very close to you. Manni, slowly. Thanks. I really loved you. Yes, I loved you too. I wasn't much help. I destroyed everything. Come. Come here.
