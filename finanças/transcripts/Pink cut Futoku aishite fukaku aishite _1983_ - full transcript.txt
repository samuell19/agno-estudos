PINK CUT: LOVE ME BIG, LOVE ME DEEP [PINK CUT: FUTOKU AISHITE FUKAKU AISHITE] Written by: Tomomi Kimura and Yoshimitsu Morita Director of photography: Koichi Suzuki Set decorator: Katsumi Nakazawa CAST: Mayumi Terashima (Mami) Mai Inoue (Yuka) Koji Sato (Egawa) Katsunobu Ito (Akira) Ryoko Watanabe (Midori) Directed by: Yoshimitsu Morita Next client, please. - What will it be? - A "job interview special". Very well. Do you have a job interview today? It's freezing outside. Is the water too hot? It's perfect. I found an amazing hair salon. The hairdressers only wear mini skirts. They're always spreading their legs. Pure joy for the customers. You don't believe me? But it's true. They caress you like this, in a sweet way. And your interview? We'll see how it goes. Just go to the salon. We need to find a job. You're right. Are you practising your diction? Yes, it's getting better. - Are you going to class? - No. - Me neither. - Stop imitating me. Everybody's skipping then. - I'm coming. - What is it? My salon's closed today. It's Monday. Indeed, I forgot. But it's time for the Economics course. It was called off. Mr Haruki is absent. Oh, he went to the spiny lobster party. College teachers have a good life. How's your business going? I have lots of clients. But management isn't my thing. You seem to get by OK. It's been a year since your father died. You've always helped me. I wonder if I'll get my diploma, teacher. Many students get it without making any effort. And since you are a serious girl, you'll get it. College doesn't interest me much. I know. It's hard. Come here. I'm busy! I'm busy! - Oh, my hairdresser. - I know you. You look like a student in that outfit. It's true. - Did you find some interesting ads? - Yes. You don't seem very motivated. Not much, to be honest. I really like your salon. - Because of the girls? - Not just that. Though they're very cute. You think so? Mine was very pretty. - You're talking about me? - Indeed! I'm popular. You live in this neighbourhood? Yes, nearby. It's convenient. - You live alone? - Does it matter? I live alone. I go to college. Thank you. See you. I'll go with you. Where're you going? Here. My parents are dead, so I took over their salon. Wait. Here's my address. I'll come back. Alright! This is our number. - When are you coming back? - Soon. Then I'll wait for your call. What's this photo? Marunouchi, the elite neighbourhood. - Will we eat there someday? - I'm not part of the elite, yet. What's this? Do you know this chocolate? No. It's called "macadamia nuts". It's from Hawaii. My friend's boyfriend found a job. They went to Hawaii to celebrate. What about you? Those little advertisements never offer real jobs. You're exaggerating! You're the only one who hasn't got one. Why's that? I hate losers. I'll find one sooner or later. I hate idiots even more. - What about affectionate guys? - You only think about that. Huh? You open it from the front. You unclip it and let it slide downward. One more time. You undo it and let it slide downward. Try it. I unclip and slide it. Okay, I did it! Got it? You're not afraid any more? No, because I did well. It's called 'front clip'. Front clip bra! Akira... Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Yuka... Yuka... Here, it's for you! Thank you. Excuse me, I have to go for a bit. - It's your turn. - Here, sit sown, please. May I? - Do you have a preference? - Do as you wish. - The client has to decide. - A perm. I'll make it shine, then. Sorry for the wait. Say... You look very handsome from here. And you are very hot. You think so? You have very soft hair. Excuse me, I'll come back. I'm very sorry for the wait. Were you in the restroom? It's your fault. You made me wet. - Are you having tummy aches? - Yes. I often have diarrhea. It smells funny. I'll buy you a good perfume. - Really? - Yes. I'm glad. Could we go out next Sunday? - Could we? - Yes. Hair tonic... Hello? Mami? It's me. Remember? - Akira? - Wrong. It's Noboru. I'm drinking alone. Can you come? I'm sorry, but I'm very busy. A-K-I-R-A. Is this your address? It's near here. "This is a pen." "Have the cherry blossoms come out yet?" Hello? Yuka? - How was your job interview? - You can guess by my voice. So, you didn't get it. Big companies aren't easy. You know? Guess what I'm doing right now. You're with someone else? I'm wearing an under-kimono. An under-kimono? Don't tease me! You know that it's almost time for the coming-of-age party. Come here with your under-kimono. That's impossible. An under-kimono... Yes. Well, I have to go. And get a job. Yuka! Hi, Akira. Hey. Hi. Lend us your room. - Oh, you're a hairdresser from... - I'm Midori. Nice to meet you She's going to do my hair here. I don't get it. Where's the toilet? Take this. Go to the movies. Why should I go to the movies? Girls don't like it when we ask them "why"? You're naive! You're skilled. Feels good? Yeah. You're the best. Open your eyes. My body's not very strong. But it's well built. You think so? I'm very sensitive to cold. Don't worry. Everybody thinks that I'm in good health. No... No. I'm skilled too. Get under me. What's wrong? I'm very sensitive. I love your body. I'm too thin, right? No way. You're handsome. Something wrong? Continue. That's a beautiful top. - I love the color. - Really? - Really. - It goes well with your bag. Chie. Where did Midori go? - She must have diarrhea. - That's just an excuse to leave. I'm constipated. It's worse. And I feel bloated. I'm searching for a good treatment. Drink some yoghurt. - See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. Welcome. But we're already closed. I was passing by. So, it really is your salon. You thought it was a lie? Give me the cash! If you help me, I'd be willing to. - Can you carry that? - Yes. I need to work. - Where do I put it? - Over there. You seem to be a good worker. Big companies need... people like you. Sadly, they don't think the same. - Mami... - What are you doing? Let me go! Did you come for this? I'm sorry. I have a weapon. So, be careful. Sir, relax. Feels good? Feels good? Alright, we're done. What's wrong with you, sir? Chie, bring me a towel. Three, two... Six. No. If you want to touch my behind, it'll be 2,000 yen, okay? Yes. Do you want special service too? - Is it possible? - It's on our list. - You're not obliged. - Let's do it. - It's 5,000 more. - Let's do it! Alright, but you must pay in advance. Here. What a nerve! What are you looking at? What is it? What happened? Chie. Why did you do that? Please don't judge me. I'm just a hairdresser. Why do you only employ Lolitas then? Isn't that the purpose: to attract men? It's sick. You arouse them, without giving anything in return. - But we're just hairdressers. - Don't be a hypocrite. I'm doing nothing wrong. If anything, I earn the customer's loyalty. Don't mistake my salon for a Turkish bath! Are Turkish baths that bad? Work there, then. No. It's tiring. It's good to have new ideas, but the heart matters more. The sense of service. What does heart mean to you? What would you do with the perverts? Are you done? We need you. Sorry! We're coming. I have to talk to you too. About what? You'll see later. Now that I'm cured, I think I'll go back to the Turkish bath. I see. I wish I could pay you more... Money is not the only reason. When I saw Chie, I understood what bothered me in this job. You're better at the Turkish baths. Find yourself a sponsor. Me? Who would want me? Don't underestimate yourself. But I love my job. So, I'll manage. That's good. Give my regards to Egawa when you see him. - Don't catch a cold. - I'll be careful. Three, two, six... Hello? Akira Tomonaga. Is it you, my hairdresser? Right away. Thank you for the other day. And I apologize for... I don't have anything in particular to ask you. Then, why did you call me? I don't know. Can I shave you? Come. But the salon's closed. This is my place. It's great to feel privileged. Yes, indeed. Did you read all of your advertisements? No, not yet. You're not in a rush. Let's change the subject. Talk to me about Midori. You know her? She's dating a friend of mine. She's just resigned. Oh, really? Have I shaved you well? Front clip bra. Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Why are you sighing? I spent the night studying. It's the truth. You could have called me. It's fine. You can lie down if you want. You're beautiful in a kimono. You don't smell like you used to. It's not my fault. Sorry, it was the scent of my kimono. Why did you come so early? I came to encourage you. For what? You have a job interview tomorrow, right? Should we go to the hotel? Yes, of course. I don't like it when we do it here. Let's go! Today, I'm paying. Here. That's sweet of you. Tomorrow, do your best, okay? Student discount. Today, give me all your love. I'll do it. I'm not saying anything else, because you know what I want. Understood. Come. Akira. Heave-ho! Heave-ho! That's it. I want to do it again. Do me as much as you want. But in exchange, you know what I want. I'm not saying anything else. I know, Yuka. I'll succeed. One more time. Heave-ho! "We're still studying your application" Big deal! Be more direct, people! Fools! So? Did you fail again? Yuka... What should I tell my parents? Every guy I know found a job, except you. I'm fed up. I can't wait anymore. - The big companies are stupid. - You're the one who's stupid. Me? What should I say to my parents? - You're repeating yourself. - Oh really? - Your parents have nothing to do with this. - They have. - This is between us. - Our families are concerned too. Then come live with me. I don't want to live in a garret room. Hi, Akira! I'm leaving. Did you dump her? Did she dump you? What do you want? Can we go for a drive? Lend me your car. Stop hitting on girls! I want to go to the beach alone! And me? I'll lend you my bedroom. Call your girl. If Midori refuses, should I invite Natsuko? Fuck whoever you want. I don't care. Hello? Akira? Where are you? Wait a minute. - Do you want to go out? - For a drive? Let's go. Shall we? I don't go out for drives much. Where do you want to go? Wherever you want. What do you think about today's female students? I like them. They're happy. Of course. They live on other people's dimes. There's no gas station nearby. Should we call someone? But there's no phone booth. There's a light over there. Let's go see. I'm not very lucky... But I like these types of unexpected things. Everyone's riding a car. They have it easy. And we ran out of gas. My coat suits you. It's too big. Too little. No, too big. - There's a VCR. - Yes, amazing. Do you come here often? - No, it's my first time. - Liar. - You're right. - That's better. Do you have a girlfriend? You're the first. You're lying. We'd be more relaxed at your salon. Let's unclip it and let it slide downward. Front clip bra. I'm going to take a bath. Wait a little. Let's go together. - No, I'm embarrassed. - Don't leave me alone. How far can you scratch yourself? Here. Alright. - Over there. - Here? It's my turn now. Your head. - Is the water too hot? - It's perfect. - How about this? - Perfect! - And this? - It's... perfect. - And this? - It's perfect. That makes me horny. I found your hideout. Come in. It's been a while. You look amazing. I have a new boyfriend. I see. You got a bit fatter. He's employed at Japan Electricity. Your parents must be happy. He's waiting for me downstairs. You want to meet him? When you see him, you'll reflect about your life. I'm a bit nervous, you know? And I practice karate. I don't want to do something I'll regret. Don't worry. He's over 5'8". He has a law degree. He lives alone, is handsome and has a car. He's athletic and open-minded. He seems perfect. You found your ideal man. So, you're the guy who took her virginity? - Stop! - Answer me! Stop, Akira! Are you alright? Enough, Akira! You should've added two qualities: polite and sturdy. Right, Yuka? - Hi, Akira! - Hi. - You have guts! - You saw? - But you have another girl waiting! - Of course. Akira! - Hey! - Hi! What are you doing here? On one side: the boss of a hairdressing salon. On the other: a young student. You little minx! You're such a sneaky girl. I wanted it to be a surprise. You're taking Economics? I'm taking Law. What about going to a cafe? Good idea. I have something to do first. I'll meet you in a bit. Okay. Surprising. She's a student too. You still gave me my diploma, despite my repeated absences - Thank you very much. - I hope it helps you develop your sense of service... and improve your management skills. Do you have someone now? I hope it's not another teacher. Not at all. That's better. I'd be jealous. But it'll be sad. I won't hear your cute moans in my office. Please do me a favor. I want to kiss your hyper-sensitive thighs. Just a little. You don't feel anything anymore? It's over now. Thank you for everything. That's cruel. College diploma: Miss Mami Azusa. Congratulations! Mr. Akira Tomonaga. We announce that you've been recruited by ET Electricity. You will be assigned to the Marunouchi neighbourhood. Congratulations! But why? I want to work with you in your hair salon. Are you joking around again? No, I'm serious. Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Welcome! Sir! Wait for your turn. It's healthy time!
