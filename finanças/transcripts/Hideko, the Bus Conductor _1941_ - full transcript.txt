HIDEKO, THE BUS CONDUCTRESS Written and Directed by Mikio NARUSE Produced by Nanyo Cinematography by Ken AZUMA Art Direction by Kazumi KOIKE Music by Nobuo IIDA Based on a story by Masuji IBUSE The Cast: Hideko TAKAMINE Keita FUJIWARA Daijiro NATSUKAWA Tamae KIYOKAWA Yotaro KATSUMI The next stop, Inoue. There's no passenger. It's my habit to say that. I thought somebody got on unnoticed. Business is bad. We won't get paid. I think you're right. That's too bad. Look! A Kaihatsu bus. It runs well. Seems comfortable. I'm disappointed. Okoma, take a nap in the back. No passengers for a while. This isn't a stop. What'll we do? Stop. We need money. Sorry to make you wait. Thank you. - We should've refused him. - This isn't a truck. I'm sorry. Don't be. We have so little business. Sorry to keep you waiting. We got only 20 sen from them. Kaihatsu buses are cleaner and faster. But this bus is never crowded. This bus is convenient for carrying baggage. Stop near my house. Mama. What happened? A present. Kimono. It was cheap, so I bought it. - For me? - Yes. You'll be short of money. Never mind. - Are my clogs there? - Yes. Gotta run, Mom. Goodbye. Thanks. My best to the landlady. - How's Shin? - Playing outside. Sorry to make you wait. Hey, Shin. I'm back. Welcome home. It was hot, wasn't it? You're awake. I want a scrub brush. A scrub brush. 15 sen. Thank you very much. Take this. I forgot to tell you. Mr. Toda said that your company is no good. In what way? The bus business is only a front. Actually they do bad things. I wonder. What he said might be right. They can't do business with that dirty bus. But before Kaihatsu Bus developed like it did, our company's business was good. They'd better close the company. This is no time to hesitate. I'll tell you. I think there is a way to get more business. If they shut down, I'd feel sad. I understand. You're a pretty girl. Too pretty for that bus. Oh, no! May I help with the cooking? Yes. I'm fixing supper. - Will you buy some bean curd? - Yes. I'll carry the baby. Nevermind, it's hot. You're welcome. - Landlady? - Yes? We missed a chance. They're broadcasting about bus conductresses. What time is it now? Bus conductresses? What's it about? About bus guides. Maybe it's still on. Good. It's still going on. Over there you can see Atagawa Spa. They say Ota Dokan found it while hunting. We've come to Imajiro-hama Spa. White sand, green pine trees, fragrance of the sea - it's a popular health resort. She's good. This is Minamoto, the shogun's birthplace. Over there you see steam gushing high. That's Mine Spa, the biggest gusher in the Orient. It gushes 95,000 gallons in a minute. Using the hot water, to grow celery, melons, vegetables, peas and so on. We're approaching Shimoda Port. Over there, you can see Rendagi Spa. Shimoda borders the ocean, near Sagami Bay and the Sea of Honshu. Mr. Sonoda. I want to talk to you. About what? Your secret love affair? Don't be silly. You're wrong. What is it? Did you hear the radio program about bus guides? Sightseeing buses? If we did like that, business would increase. Are there noted places along our route? I'm a stranger here. There must be a few. Why not try, if you want? Will you tell our boss? If I did, he'd think I'm fresh. All right. I'll have a talk with him. Your pretty voice'll attract people. Don't say it. I'm ashamed. Want this? No, thanks. I'll give you extra. I used this a little. It's all right. - I'll go. Take care of the shop. - All right. Our company is like a bunch of hoodlums. I like buses best. My only delight is a pleasant drive. I think so. If only we could work better. Not for the money. You're right. Listen, Okoma, People are talking about us. When a country gets confused, loyal subjects appear, so they say. - Are we loyal subjects? - Yes. It's surprising. "Loyal subjects" is bombast. Boss, what do you think of it? I don't think that plan will make a profit. You're wrong. I'm sure it will. I've been fond of opening bottles of lemonade. It's interesting. They open with a pop. I like it. Look at this. I see, I like it, too. Let's get back to the subject. What do you think about my idea? Boss. I want to talk to you. What is it, Sonoda? Do you want to make demands? Hardly that. I have a suggestion. And that is? Well? Speak up! I'm busy. Very well. You may have heard the radio. About bus guides. They describe the locale. I know what you want to say. But describing the locale is troublesome. The driver doesn't have to speak. But the girl does while punching tickets. She'll lose money. But many companies have adopted the system. It relieves passengers of boredom. It enlivens the atmosphere. I'll make Okama watchful of money. I see. Are there any noted places here? Well, I don't know. We should adopt the system before Kaihatsu does. Before Kaihatsu? It's a great pleasure. Let's do it. Find out what noted places are around here. I'll have a man write the guide's announcement. No. I'll leave it to you and the girl. Okay. It's settled. About your plan... - How did it go? - The boss agreed. Glad to hear it. He wants you and me to write the dialogue. I'll find the places. Will you write the script? I can't. We'll need an expert. That's too bad. Is there a good one? Let's see. I know one. Who? The writer staying at the Tokyokan Inn. I brought him the notebook he left on the bus. Do you think a writer will help us with this? Let's try. I'll call and ask him. He accepted so easily. Can we trust him? He's all right. He seems okay and trustworthy. He must be an unpopular man. I think he likes to do that kind of stuff. I wonder. "Ladies and gentlemen, this is the Kohoku Bus Thank you for your patronage. I'll explain to you about the noted places along the route. " "Ladies and Gentlemen, we're on the Koshu Highway. There's a branch of this road behind the houses on the left. That's the Oume road. As you know... " This way, please. May I interrupt? I'm Sonoda, a driver for Kohoku Bus. Please favor me. I know you. I often use your bus. The bus is dirty. But it's nice to tell people about places along the way. I'll show you how to speak as a sample. I like this kind ofwork. "You can see a narrow road to the right. It runs parallel to this road. It's the old Koshu Highway. You can see a round mound; That's called Niwazuka. In the old days this area was called Wado-no-hara. Whenever the government changed, the refugees were forced to come here... " That part is a little funny. I'll change it. Conductress, listen well to my reading. To the tone of expression. The next part might be a little conventional. But it's emotional. It'll please people. Listen carefully to the sentimental tone. "Ladies and gentlemen, we're passing the Fuefuki River. You can see a little hill upstream to the left. That's Sashide-no-iso which is in an old poem: Plovers living in Sashide-no-iso sing, wishing the Emperor's lasting reign. Sashide-no-iso is there. " Don't speak too fast in the shaking bus. Your bus is old and rickety. Be careful, Mr. Ikawa. I'm sorry. Conductress, you have an accent, don't you? Yes, sir. Okoma has almost no accent. She always listens to radio dramas and lectures. She can speak standard Japanese. Girls here say that. Her best teacher of correct Japanese is the radio. Is that so? But having a little accent is better. Take this "Sashide-no-iso" for example. People here stress the first syllable. "Sa" is strong. I think it is better because it expresses local color. I wonder... Anyway I'll give this to you. If your employer agrees, use this manuscript. I hope you don't change it too much. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. By the way, let me ask you something... How much do you want for this? How much? My fee? I don't want money. You brought me the notebook. That's enough. I can't thank you enough. The fact is, she planned this guidance system. As for the fee for the script, our company hasn't decided the amount. Never mind that, I'm used to writing for nothing. Conductress, you'd better read this aloud. Read it aloud. Read it. "This is the Kohoku Bus" "Thank you for your patronage" "I'll explain to you about noted places along the route" "We're on Koshu Highway" "There's a branch of this road behind the houses on the left" "That's the Oume road" Stop. Fluent reading isn't enough. Modulation is important. When you mention the Oume road, you must speak with more emotion, so that people can imagine travel in the old days. Read on. "As you know" "Koshu Highway and the Oume road start in Shinjuku" "They separate, go up hills and cross rivers" "When they reach Koshu, they meet at this point" "On the left you can see bamboo growing" Generally, you're good. But a bus conductress must speak using gestures. When you speak about the bamboo on the left, you should point in that direction. Bus conductresses move their hand like this to indicate places. I see. That's better. Try. Like this? That's all right. Practice the statements repeatedly. Thank you very much, sir. Next is location of places. I'll tell you on the bus tomorrow. We're very grateful, sir. I thank him for writing this. But I have to punch tickets, and open and shut windows. I won't have time for this. I want him to shorten it. I think it is a bit too long. You better talk only when you're not busy. I agree. I didn't expect that he'd write such a long script. Ten pages. - He's very kind. - I wonder. It pleases him to make people listen to his writings. So he did it for free. Bring it to our boss and let him read it. If he agrees, I'll memorize it. Boss. Oh, Sonoda. I'll give you last month's salary. I've just paid my men. I'm grateful, Boss. This is the bus girl's script. I want your opinion. A specialist wrote it. Please read it. A specialist wrote it, huh? - This'll do, I suppose. - I'll go. Wait. Who"s the specialist that wrote it? A writer staying at the Toyokan Inn. - His name is Ikawa. - Ikawa? I've never heard of him. He can't be very famous. I don't think he's famous. He wants money, doesn't he? He'll take a small fee. Give him this. If he complains, return the script. Hey. Wait. Here's your bus girl's pay too. Thank you very much. It's hot today. Office Girl! Ice and lemonade. For all the men. How many are here? Thank you very much. The Boss was in a good mood today. He approved the script. And he paid us. Here. And here's the writer's fee. - He paid? - Of course. I didn't ask him. He volunteered. Ah, that's good. Okoma, take it to him. - Please come with me. - All right. Mr. Ikawa, the bus company people are here again. - For what? - They have something for you. Have them wait outside. It's good to see you again. You're too kind. This is a reward from our boss. I didn't mind doing it. Ten yen. Shall I write a receipt? It's not necessary. It's such a small sum. Excuse me. Let's return. He accepted the fee indifferently, - with no restraint. - As a matter of course. Let's start from here. Ladies and gentlemen, we're on the Koshu Highway. There's a branch of this road behind the houses on the left. That's the Oume road. As you know, Koshu Highway and the Oume Road start in Shinjuku. They separate, go up hills and cross rivers. When they reach Koshu, they meet at this point. On the left, you can see bamboo growing. They're the remains of a bamboo grove. It was once an execution ground. You've improved. But say it with emotion. I'll practice. Okoma, you're good. I get excited while driving. Mr. Sonoda, we passed the stop. - Was there a passenger? - Yes. Don't get excited. It's dangerous. Don't worry. I'm all right. That was close, kid! Mr. Ikawa, please get off. Okoma! Watch out! Hello? What? An accident? Ah, the Boss is here. Our bus caused an accident. Mr. Sonoda is on the phone. What? An accident? Hello? Ah, Boss. This is Sonoda. I rolled our bus on a farm. And Okoma got hurt. I'm sorry, Boss. The engine and windows weren't broken, right? What about injuries? There was only one passenger. He was outside and safe. The engine and body are safe. You said the passenger was outside the bus? Did you roll the bus while it was stopped? Don't you know our bus is insured? I know, Boss. So I asked people who came to help. And not touch the bus. I think the damage was just a scratch on the right side. I'm getting mad at you. According to law, If you leave a bus running while stopped, we can't collect on the insurance. Don't you know that? I know. In fact, it fell on the farm while it wasn't running. But if it were damaged, you could insist that it fell while it was running. Go there and break the engine and other parts. And break the windows. Get it? How outrageous! Hello, Sonoda... Answer! Get over there. Even when you order me, I can't do that. - We'll have to repair it. - Shut up! We must buy a used bus with the insurance money. Understand? If I can't buy one, I'll close the company. But there's a passenger who witnessed the scene. The passenger's in this hospital. Put that woman on the phone. Is the passenger a woman? Or a man? The passenger's a man. I see. Make sure that nobody's listening while you talk on the phone. And when you speak, speak in a low voice. The phone's at the end of a hall, so nobody can hear. But the passenger has been listening. He's beside me. What? Beside you? Stupid! I don't need to talk to him. Let him go. How foolish he is! Hey, girl! She went out on your orders. Mr. Ikawa, is perjury a grave crime? Yes. It's quite serious. Not only the law, it's morally bad too. To give false testimony is to double cross people. Not only that, you deceive yourself. It's very bad. I'm in a fix. What'll we do? What will you do? I decided. If I have to tell a lie, I will resign. I'll quit too. There are other jobs. Right. Mr. Ikawa, I suddenly feel cheerful. Being an honest man feels good. Mr. Sonoda... Let's ask him to write a good resignation letter for us. Good. Please write in a good style, so that we'll feel better. Don't be hasty. I don't think you'll have to quit. He'll make me commit perjury. Wait until I meet him. Leave it to me. I feel that I'm a little responsible. Do you think so? What's up? This gentleman was there when the accident happened. Really? So what? I know what you said. Did you really mean it? What are you planning? Blackmail? He's a writer from Tokyo. He wrote the bus girl's script. I see. Are you the man? About the phone call... Let's forget about it. Of course you have some connection with the newspaper people, I suppose. Yes, I have. Naturally... I've heard of your good reputation, sir. Don't address me with 'sir'. The point is... What I said on the phone was only a joke. Sonoda, did you believe what I said? Yes, I did. You're a fool! Couldn't you see that I was joking? Please come in. Girl, bring us something cold. Ice and lemonade, as usual. Please come in. Don't hesitate. Sonoda... I think that this is a good opportunity to clean the bus. That bus is really dirty. I'm ashamed. It's been crowded every day. I want to ask you a question. In the other companies buses, there are flowers. Do we have flowers on our buses? - No, sir. - Too bad. Put flowers in it. Don't worry about the expense. I forgot to ask you. How's your injury? I've been so anxious about it. It's only sore. I'll be fine in two days. That's good. I feel better. Take care of yourself. Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the Kohoku Bus. Thank you for your patronage. I'll explain to you about noted places along the route. Hello. Glad to see you. - How are you? - I'm completely cured. That's good. I wanted to go to the company. I'll work tomorrow. The bus has been cleaned. I'm glad. Mr. Ikawa said he'll return to Tokyo by the 2:30 train. I said we would see him off at the crossing. Let's see him! The owner of this shop will return soon. We're in time. The train will be here soon. He helped us a lot. I practiced a lot and became good at speaking. I regret that he won't be able to listen. He seemed to like his own writings. Here it comes. Goodbye! Let's work hard from tomorrow. The bus is clean and you're good at the information. I'm happy. The boss has been cheerful since that day. Mr. Ikawa made us happy. Mr. Ikawa said that you look like a boy called "carrot" in a French movie. "Carrot"? I said that you looked more "turnip". Turnip? Forgive me. Damn you! Hey, Sonoda. - This is real clean. - Yes, Boss. How's the engine? It's in good shape. Take a look at this. "La, la, la with a cart full of flowers" "Spring has come From hills to towns" "Let's buy violets from that flower girl" "In her clear eyes, there are spring dreams" "La, la, la, here come vegetables for the market" "Spring has come from hills to towns" "Young wives shopping in the morning" "In their baskets full of spring" I should explain here, but I can't. We can't. We passed the place. So, it's too late. Thank you very much. You missed the first commentary. - The next one too. - Why? Cheer up, Okoma. - Take this. - Thank you. You can use that bus for a long time. It was a real bargain. I wonder. It'll be used in the back country. The bus is too good. Cold drink? No, thank you. Hey, girl! We fired her yesterday. Oh, I see. What about this office? I'll close it today. Go to the tea house. Ice and lemonade? Ladies and gentlemen, we're passing the Fuefuki River. You can see a little hill upstream to the left. That's 'Sashide-no-iso" in an old poem. Plovers living on Sashide-no-iso sing Wishing for the Emperor's lasting reign. Sashide-no-iso is there. THE END
