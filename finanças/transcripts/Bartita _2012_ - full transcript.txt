-You're crazy! -You're replacing me for a whore? Get out of my house! -Get out! -You slapped me! -I told you, get out! -For a whore? -You're crazy! -Let go of me! You're crazy! You brought your daughter to expose me in front of her? And you brought a whore... What's wrong? Take care of yourself, girl. Don't ever upset God. -I never upset God. -You shouldn't die a sinner. She'll die a sinner. She'll die a sinner. She'll die a sinner. She committed suicide. -Wait, calm down. -Let go of me! I want to see Mom! Mom. Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! She's dead. You killed her! You killed her! Get out! Mom. Mom. Mom. -I'm very scared, Mom. -Don't be, dear. What's that sound? Wessam? Mona! You scared me to death! We were looking for a candle. What's wrong, people? Mona, we thought that since the fridge was empty, we'd fill it with some food. But it seems that it was a bad idea. -Thank you. -Come and see what we bought. -Hey! Watch it! -Are you talking to me? -Where are you going? -I'm going into Abdel Rahman's office. As simple as that? You think you can just waltz in freely? How did you get here, anyway? Where's security? I should call security on you. Who is he, Mona? -Who is she, Mona? -That's Mona, Abdel Rahman's daughter. Really? Take this. I'll go give him my resignation now. I don't know how to apologize, Sir. I'm really sorry. Sit down, Maged. Seems you two have met. Maged is the best employee I have. -Was, Sir. -Was? No, he is. He's the best at closing deals, and I'm making him a member of the board. Two days ago, when he found out you were travelling to Paris, he took care of everything in no time; the visa, the hotel, the ticket. Is the car far from here? By the way, this is my car. I'll drive. Yes, I know that. Really? Fine, then. There's a taxi right there, it's not far. -Open the door for me. -God give me patience. There you go, Ma'am. Answer, Mona. It's Wessam. I swear if you don't pick up now, I'll get your husband and come over. Did you like how I made you pick up the phone? Are you crazy? No, I'm kidding, of course. Tell me, how is your depression? Mona, don't tell me you're still taking those damn antidepressants. I'm telling you this 'cause I'm worried about you. No one cares more than me. Mona, why aren't you answering me? -Answer, girl. -No, I stopped taking those pills. -How are you doing? -How am I doing? Still the same. -Pray for me, Wessam. -Sure. -Bye-bye. -Bye, dear. Honestly, Sir, I like Mona, and I want to ask you for her hand in marriage. That's good. Why are you so stressed, son? You'll be a great husband. Every woman hopes for a man like you. I'm sure Mona will accept. One second. -Mona. -Yes, Mr. Abdel Rahman. -Come here, please. -Right away. As a wedding present, I'll assign you to the board as a senior member. I don't know how to repay you, Sir. -I'm at your service, Mr. Abdel Rahman. -At my service? -You're pretending not to know? -Mr. Abdel Rahman, -I meant your daughter, Mona. -What? He was one of your best employees, and you wanted to make him a board member? Enough. Him being a good employee doesn't mean I'll let him marry my girl. He's an exploiter. I won't let an animal like him fool me, understood? Maged is no animal. He loves me, he'd never cheat, -and he won't do what you did to Mom. -What? -Calm down, Uncle. -She didn't mean that, Uncle. -Calm down, Mona. What are you saying? -What did you mean by that? If God can forgive me, why can't you? I refused to get married again after she died for your sake! Wait, Uncle. She's impossible, Tarek! I can't please her, whatever I do! I'm warning you, Mona! Don't you dare defy me! -Come with me, Uncle, please. -Don't you dare! -Come with me. -Enough of her bullshit. -That's it, it looks very nice. -He's still not answering. He'll show up. Your dad loves you, he won't leave you on a day like today. Don't worry, I asked Tarek to talk to him. Give it to me. Get the door. You're so beautiful. -I said your dad wouldn't show up, Mona. -I can't believe it. Let's go, beautiful bride. Let's go, everyone has left. I want to see Dad. Please, Maged, I want to go see him. What are you saying, Mona? You have to leave with your husband now. We'll all go see him tomorrow. -Come on, Maged. -Please, Maged. He always wanted to see me in my wedding dress. Welcome, darling. I'm sorry I didn't attend your wedding. -Where's Dad, Nanny? -Saiida. I don't want to see anyone tonight. Dad. Dad! -So? You didn't have any luck? -No one wants to hire me. -They all support your dad. -So it's my dad's fault? I didn't say that, but no one wants to interview me. -We'll try again. -Try again? Start again from scratch and kiss some asses again? Are you an idiot or what? Why are you talking like it was my fault? It was your fault! He's officially gone crazy. That's enough, Tarek. You should make a call and have a friend teach him a lesson. Calm down. -Why did Maged do that, Mona? -He has issues and lashed out at her. After she deserted her father for him, that jerk showed his true face. What's wrong with you, Wessam? -I want to get a divorce. You tell him. -Calm down, Mona. I think you should stay here for a few days until things calm down. It's already over. Don't be upset with me for saying this, Mona, but Abdel Rahman was right. -This isn't the right time. -Wessam is right, Tarek. I was wrong. I thought I loved him, and I believed he loved me. I thought our differences weren't important. At the very least, he'd always take care of me. He'd never think about cheating on me. But it seems that I was wrong. Fine, then call your dad and go back home. He's the reason all this happened. You want me to go back to him? I'm not entering that house again. If you don't mind, I'll stay at the Abu Talat villa until I feel better. If we don't mind? It's your villa. It's your dad's villa, and he gave it to us. He considers my husband the cool member of your family. Show me your palm, girl. Why are you looking at me like that? Will I die like my mother? -Are you Mona Jamal? -Yes. These flowers are for you. -Who from? -I don't know. -Do you like the flowers? -Who's this? -You don't know me. -Hang up, please. -No. -No? First, I'm a respectable man. Second, I'm-- Are you going to tell me your life story? If you want me to. ANSWER THE PHONE QUICKLY Do you like my handwriting? You're either crazy or you have flowers to spare. -What do you want? -I want you to be happy. -Who told you that flowers make me happy? -A little bird told me. You know what time it is? I just wanted to wish you good night. Goodnight. Don't put the flowers beside you. They'll compete with you for oxygen. Fine. Bye. -What are you doing? -I'm making a coffee. I was married once. What about you? I was watching a movie. I'm going to sleep now. Goodnight. Goodnight. -How are you, Wessam? -What do you want? -Won't you let me in? -One second. Tarek! Tarek! Where's Mona, Wessam? You know where she is. What is it, Maged? -You want to beat her up again? -I know I was wrong, Tarek, but a man must know where his wife is. You're not a man! A man doesn't beat a lady. If you weren't in my house, I'd show you how to be a man. Don't be startled! I knocked many times, then went through the back door. How could you leave it open? You scared me to death, woman. How could you do that? Come in. -Here you go, dear. -Thanks. -I guess congratulations are in order. -For what? -Here you go. -What's this? Your divorce certificate. I felt like I was living in a nightmare. What is it? Why are you staring at the phone? No reason. Don't you want to tell your dad? He's worried about you. Dad got what he wanted, my divorce. Let him forget about me. Fine. -Where are you going? -I have to go. -You're still taking these damn pills? -No, I stopped. -Mona. -I swear I stopped. When I call you, answer quickly. Don't worry me. -Fine. -Take care of yourself. Sure. Say hi to Tarek for me. -Bye. -Bye. -Drive safe. -Sure. -Hello? -Where were you? -Do you like seafood? -What? Meet me in Al Kalaa restaurant in an hour. -Can I get you anything, Ma'am? -No, I... A coffee, please. I'm waiting for someone. -Right away. -Thanks. What's wrong? Nothing. -Do you want me to leave? -No. Stay. -You looked surprised when you saw me. -I just can't get my head around it. You can't get your head around it? Until you do that, let's order. I'm starving. Deal? -Mohammed! -Who's Mohammed? There must be someone named Mohammed here. Right. No! Cellphones are the thing I hate the most. When we're together, forget about this phone. Don't worry, I won't throw it away. Put it in your purse. Sure. They make special meals for me here. -When will I see you again? -Leave things be. I'll give you some time to think about it. So? Did you think about it? -What are you doing here? -I missed you. -We just parted. -What's the problem? -All right. Good night. -Good night. I was living with my parents in Canada, but I couldn't take it. People there are very cold. You know? The weather affects people. Really. Egypt is hot and beautiful, you know... and warm, like you. -That's why I came back. -What about your parents? They'll never come back. They've been away for 25 years. Dad is a professor at a university. Mom works with the United Nations. They've been there for so long. Did your parents mind that you came back? It wasn't easy, but I convinced them. I told them, "When you decided to travel, I was still a kid. But now, I get to choose if I stay or if I leave." So I came back... to see you. I never got the chance to ask you this. Where and how did you see me? I saw you leaving your house one morning. It was like I'd seen one of the mermaids they told us about when we were kids. But I told myself that this mermaid needed something. -Like what? -Me. -You never told me about your work. -Fine. You're changing the subject, but it's fine. I've loved the sea since I was a kid. That's why I bought this yacht when I came back. It became my house and my office. Your office? I travel between Egypt and Greece. I import salmon, sardines, tuna, things like that. -You want to see for yourself? -Sure. Come with me. Come here. -Where are you taking me? -Don't you want to see for yourself? -What? Crazy man! -Come on! You're crazy! -Do you know how to swim? -Yes. Let's go. Yes, that's it. You'll have the best seafood ever in just five minutes. You're a good cook, too. Everything I do, I try to do it the right way. -What? -What is it? You look beautiful with wet hair. I want to hug you. Wait! I said "want to." I wasn't going to do anything. Would you like some music? Really? One second, I have to get the door, someone's knocking. Okay. It's you? Why are you here? -Did you have breakfast? -No. -Let's eat, then. -Wait, let me change. There's no time. I'm starving. -One second. -Let's go. You look beautiful anyway. I wish I'd known you a long time ago so I wouldn't have had to go through all this. You'd have been the first man in my life. I feel so safe when I hold you. I want to spend my whole life with you. -Did you say something, darling? -Yes, I said I wanted chocolate. Chocolate? Sure. Hold on tight. -Good night, then. -Good night. I almost forgot. Happy birthday. -What's that? -Isn't today your birthday? -How did you know? -It's written on your license. -This is too much. -Nothing is too much for you. -Look, isn't it nice? -It goes great with those pajamas. -Peace be upon you. -Upon you, too. Who are you? -We-- -Come on. Won't you let them in? Come on in, Sir. -In the name of God, the Almighty. -Come on in, guys. You're welcome. -Wait. Who are they? -It's your last day as a single lady. This is the marriage official and these are the witnesses. I'll marry you now. May you have a blessed marriage. Sign here, bride. Yes, congratulations. Listen. Go to your house, get your things, hand in the keys, and come here. -Understand? -Sure, darling. -Good evening, how are you? -Where were you, Mona? You left your phone here? We thought something happened. I was away. What's wrong? I... don't know what to say to you, Mona. -Uncle Abdel Rahman... -What's wrong with Dad? May he rest in peace. I was trying to reach you for two days, but I couldn't. Stay strong, Mona. We'll always be here for you. May God give us patience. Thank God he didn't suffer, Mona. Pray for his soul. -He died angry at me. -Don't say that, Mona. Abdel Rahman used to ask about you every day. But he asked me not to tell you. Come on, Mona. Let's pack your things and go. You go ahead. Go ahead? We'll wait here until you're ready. Please, guys. I'll pack and travel myself. Come with you? How? The first time I meet your family, you want me to tell them, "May he rest in peace"? That's not right. You go, darling. I'll wait for you. May he rest in peace. May God grant you patience, Mona. He was very close to our hearts. His death has affected us all. May he rest in peace. May he rest in peace, Mona. Thank you, Maged. -Isn't it enough? -Isn't what enough? -Time has passed between us. -Please, Maged. I know I shouldn't talk about it now. I was determined not to mention it when I came here. -But when I saw you, I couldn't help it. -Please, Maged. That's enough. -It's not the time for this. -Fine. I'm sorry. As you wish, Mona. -Thank you, Om Hussein. -You're welcome, Sir. Don't worry, everything in his will was as expected. Mr. Abdel Rahman Jamal wanted to give 100,000 Egyptian pounds to the manager of his office, Mr. Riyad Rahmi, to show his appreciation. And the rest, according to the law, will be split between you and Mrs. Mona. But not equally, of course. Please, Uncle. I want to get this over with as soon as possible. I have to return to Abu Talat. Why do you want to return? Stay here, at your house. If you don't want to be alone, stay with us. You don't get it. I have to return because... my husband is waiting for me and I don't want to be late. -Why did Maged go to Abu Talat? -Maged? I said "my husband." Maged is no longer my husband. We're divorced. Oh, my God! Since when? Why didn't you tell us? "Since when," what? Wasn't it you who brought me the divorce certificate? -Me? -Yes, you! I gave her the divorce certificate? Say something! Tarek wasn't with you. You were alone. Calm down, Mona. When did this happen? About... -Do you have this divorce certificate? -Yes, it's at the villa. Are you sure you married someone other than Maged? -Yes, I'm sure. -Where's your husband now? Her husband Maged is at home, Mr. Mehdi, and he's waiting for her to come back. He loves her, he adores her. What's wrong with you, Mona? -What's wrong? -Get away form me! Do you want to drive me crazy? I told you, Maged divorced me! -All right, calm down, dear. -I don't want to calm down. I don't understand what's happening. You came to the villa with the divorce certificate. I have it, I swear! -I'm not crazy! -Stop... The number you're calling is not available... We couldn't find anything. It was here, I swear it was here. Calm down. Take it easy, dear. Focus. The divorce and marriage certificates are not important. Where's your husband? MARRIAGE OFFICIAL'S OFFICE -Good day, Sir. -Good day. -Who are you? -I'm the one who marries people. Is there another marriage official in this area? Who would open another marriage office in a remote area like this? Thank you. Come on, counselor. Let's go. Drink this, Mona. All right, Mona. We'll let you rest now. -Let's go, Wessam. -What, Tarek? How can we leave her? -I'll stay with you, Mona. -No need. I feel better now. Yes. No, I won't be there today. Tell them I'm sorry. -Mona, this man had a cellphone, right? -Of course. Give me his number. -Could you find him through his number? -Yes. Give it to me. Yes, Mona. I asked about this number in all the cellphone stores. There's no name or address mentioned in the purchase contract. He must've bought it from a stall. So, Mona? Has Ashraf disappeared? He's nowhere to be found. Ashraf is real. I'm sure about that. We asked about him everywhere, but no one knows anything about him. And you didn't bring me the divorce certificate, right? What has gotten into you? I'm worried about you. Mona, the counselor, Mehdi, called me. He said he needs your ID for the decree of distribution. The name of the groom is Ashraf Saeed Abdel Fadeel. The address is Building 15, Saqlabi Street in El Sakkakini. Mona, he needs your ID... SAEED ABDEL FADEEL -Is Ashraf here? -Grandma! There's someone asking about Uncle Ashraf. She's welcome. Let her in. You're welcome. Welcome, girl. Come on in. Have a seat. Do you know my son, Ashraf? -Ashraf is my husband. -Your husband? -When did you get married? -Less than a month ago. There's no God but Allah. My son Ashraf died three years ago. My son died three years ago. Are you sure that your husband is called Ashraf Abdel Fadeel? There is no power but that of God. This is my son, Ashraf. He died young, may he rest in peace. Is this the man you married? This is my son, Ashraf, may he rest in peace. -Good evening, dear. -Good evening, Nanny. Mr. Mehdi has been waiting for you for an hour on the terrace. Thank you, dear. -Good evening. -Good evening. You're welcome. Have a seat. -How are you, Mona? -I'm fine, thank God. I'm happy that you're going out and trying to overcome this situation you're in. -How do I overcome it? -That's why I'm here. Tarek told me that you left the company, that you stopped working there. This situation might heavily impact the empire your dad built. You want me to work when I don't know who or where my husband is? You still insist that you married another man? Tell you what, Mona. My friend is a psychologist. Please, go to him. Maybe he'll make you feel better. -Good morning. -Good morning. -Is Dr. Raouf here? -Who's asking? -Mona Abdel Aziz. -Okay. Mona Abdel Aziz is here, Doctor. Suddenly, everything disappeared. The ring. The divorce certificate. The marriage certificate. Ashraf. The marriage official, the yacht. No one believes me anymore. They all think I'm crazy. You think what happened to Mom will happen to me? First, based on what you said, she suffered from depression because of her continuous conflicts with your Dad, may he rest in peace. It's not a hereditary disease. -Then, why, Doctor? -What you told me, Mona, was very detailed. It makes it seem like it really happened. -But where's the proof? -Could it all just be an illusion? Sometimes, loneliness and antidepressants make you imagine things that never happened... just because you wanted them to happen. He married me. Do you know what that means? Enough, calm down. Take it easy. Tell you what, Mona. Why don't you stay with us here for two or three days? You can get some rest and forget all about what happened. Come on, you'll be fine. Come with me. This is your room. I want you to rest and not think about anything. Tell me if you need anything. I'm always here. Do you want me to leave? No, stay. -You looked surprised when you saw me. -No, I just can't get my head around it. I want to hug you. -Where's Dr. Raouf? -Who's asking? Tell him it's Tarek Al Jamal. Welcome, Mr. Tarek. I'm Dr. Raouf. Nice to meet you. Please, what is Mona's doing here? How can you keep her in an asylum? Ma'am, Mona needed to rest. It's not a mental hospital, as you can see. -Can I see her, please? -Who are you? I'm her husband. Sure you can. But please, don't talk to her about anything. The second floor, first room to the left. Come on in, please. Don't get up. I didn't want to disturb you. Since Tarek told me what happened, I... I've been unable to sleep. I can't fathom you cheating on me, even in your imagination. Don't you know what you mean to me? If you're doing this because you want a divorce, just say so. I can't tolerate cheating. Mona. You're divorced. Maged! -Maged! -I'm afraid he did something to her! -What's wrong, dear? -What did that animal do to you? -He told me the truth. -What truth? That I'm an adulterer. Who said you were an adulterer? What do you call what happened with Ashraf? Ashraf was in your imagination. Mona, dear, Ashraf doesn't exist. -Tell her, Doctor. -What should he tell me? Ashraf is real, and he married me while I was still married to another man! That means that I'm an adulterer! I'm an adulterer! Adulterer! I'm an adulterer. I'm an adulterer. Doc. One second. -What is it, Mona? -Ashraf is in Hurghada. -Mona, Ashraf is not real. -He is real. Everything is telling us that he's not real. Mona, you made him up. You just needed someone at a time like this. Please, at least one person has to believe me. I came here for that reason. -Please, I have to go. -I can't let you go like this. Come with me, then. Something might happen if I don't find him. Ashraf! Ashraf! -What is it? -I found Ashraf. -Let me change. -Come now, there's no time. He was here. I swear he was. Where's the boat you saw? It was also here. Calm down. Take it easy, come here. I'm telling you, I saw him! Believe me! What next, Mona? We've been here for two days and nothing has happened. Can we go back? As you wish. I'll book a flight for tomorrow morning. Would that be okay with you? Mona. Stop looking back. You should start thinking about the future. Come on, let's go. Good morning. The check. DENIED ON 5/4 -Why was it denied? -Insufficient balance. Do you take me for a fool? A bounced check? Listen. If I don't get my money by tomorrow, I'll give this check to the district attorney. Whatever happens, happens. I'm not kidding. I apologize to you all if I upset you. I didn't mean to. I miss Mom a lot. She haunts my dreams and my life so much that I've become a reflection of her. That's why I decided to join her, to be at peace. Mona. Why, Mona? Dr. Raouf, did they find the.... I called the police and gave them a photo of Mona. If they find anything, they'll let you know. I'm sorry. Her mental health had been deteriorating recently. Mona's dead, Tarek! Mona's dead! Yes, Dr. Raouf. Yes, Tarek. They found a drowned body that matches Mona's description. Could you come to identify her? -Where is she, Doctor? -In the morgue. I'm not close by. Can you go, and I'll meet you there? Should I call Mrs. Wessam? No, don't call her. She can't cope with the sight of a dead body. I'm on my way, Doctor. Okay, I'm waiting for you. -Goodbye, Doctor. -Goodbye. -Do you have hypertension or diabetes? -No, I'm fine. All right, good. This is a normal reaction to seeing a body disfigured by fish. Is it her? I don't know. Her facial features aren't defined. But my gut tells me it's Mona, Doctor. May she rest in peace. There's no God but Allah. There's no God but Allah. Put it down! In the name of Allah, the Almighty. Every human being is bound to taste death, but only on the Day of Resurrection will you be requited in full. Whoever is removed from Hell and admitted to Paradise shall prosper. -God forgive her and have mercy. -Amen. God, wash her with pure, fresh and cold water. God, make her abode in the Hereafter and her company better than that of her previous life. May God bless the Prophet Muhammad, his family, and all of his companions. All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of Worlds. Al-Fatihah. -May she rest in peace. -Thank you. May she rest in peace. Thank you. May she rest in peace. I'll give you two more days. I want my money before Thursday. -Thank you for coming. -Stay strong. -Who is he, Tarek? -He's an agent from Alexandria. -Seems he likes you a lot. -May she rest in peace. This is what matters, Maged. The good people in your life. You're home early, Tarek. What? What is it, girl? Did you see a demon? -How did you get here? -Through the window. What do you want? Aren't you hiding an ace card? If you don't leave now, I'll scream and let everyone hear me! You're such a decent girl. Don't pretend to be decent in front of me. So phony! -I'm more decent than you'll ever be. -Really? Who should we ask? The husband you turned into a thief? Or that poor girl you killed? -Mona killed herself. -You're saying that to me? I swear that Mona killed herself! She left a suicide letter with the doctor. Fine, Ma'am. Since you swear it, I believe you. Her death had nothing to do with my money, right? No, you'll have your money, every last penny. -Why the bounced checks, then? -Because Mona died, and it's all a mess. -Tarek will pay me, then? -I swear he will. We'll see. No need for Tarek to know I was here. He'll think we're having an affair. -Welcome, Tarek. -Welcome, counselor. Welcome, have a seat. Tell me, how can I help? I'm sorry I came here without an appointment, but I need to know. Did you file Mona's divorce papers? Yes, why? Nothing. I was just surprised to see Maged at her funeral. No, Maged divorced her before she died. It appears that he really loved her. Your uncle wronged him. Let's talk about what's important to you. All the inheritance is yours, don't worry. I'm not worried at all. I wouldn't mind not getting anything. I just wanted to know the legal situation so that we don't wrong anyone. Yes, sure. Excuse me, I have a meeting. -Make yourself at home. -Go ahead. -Who is it? -Who do you think? Open the door, Wessam. Why did you lock the door? I heard a noise outside. I thought it was you. I opened the door, but I didn't see you. I got scared, so I locked the door. -You look like you saw a ghost. -I'll be fine. Tell you what, you're not helping. In fact, you might get us in trouble. What did the lawyer say to you? Don't worry, he divorced her before she died. All the inheritance is ours now. How nice! It's as if God wants to make it up to me. -Here you go, dear. -How sweet of you! I wish it happened a long time ago. Tarek, we should pay that jerk. Where is this coming from? You said the opposite before. It's better than him showing up unexpectedly. -Did you see him? -Yes, I did. I saw him this morning at the funeral. You saw that jerk? He came to threaten me. HOW ARE YOU, ASHRAF? OR SHOULD I SAY, KHALED? I MISS YOU She's not dead, man! Go to the morgue and see for yourself! See for myself? Are you crazy? I'm thankful they issued the death certificate. Listen, don't call me again. I'll call you, bye. Hello? What did I ever do to you to deserve this? Answer me! What did I do to you? You destroyed my life. You made me an adulterer. Shame on you. Why did you do it? They told me you were divorced. I married you legally. Who is "they"? Why did you do it? Your family. Your cousin, Tarek, and his wife. You're lying again! How do you know Tarek? I'm not lying! I've known Tarek and his wife for over a year now. What? I meet them every day to play poker. Wait. Get me my checkbook. Check? We don't accept checks in poker. -What can I do? I don't have money. -If you don't have money, who does? The manager of the El Jamal Company has no money? You don't know anything. -Tell him. -Tell me what? He wrote me a check every time. Did you cash these checks? The first one bounced. -What's wrong, man? -You think you're playing against a fool? What's wrong? Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose! I don't lose to cheaters! How did he intend to finance these checks? By getting his share of the company. How was he going to get his share while Dad was still alive? I swear I know nothing about your dad. All they asked me was to enter your life and leave quickly. So, what do you think? -What's in it for me? -You'll get one million pounds. That's nice, but I want it all in cash before I do anything. Cash? You know that's not possible. It's not my problem. Let him steal from the company like he always does. Even if he gets caught, his uncle is the owner. What would he do to him? He'd put me in jail. He's a jerk. He keeps me employed at his company so that people say he's a nice man. That he feels for his nephew. Tarek was supposed to manage the company, not that animal, Maged, the one he assigned to the board as chairman. He married Mona so he could get the company all to himself. The most important thing now is that Mona is alone. Her dad is mad at her, and she's mad at her husband. She needs a man. -A nice one? -A handsome one. -What's her story? -I know all her stories. I'll tell you what she likes and what she hates. You'll be in complete control. If you don't believe me, come with me, and I'll prove it to you. Tell me, Tarek, why are we driving this late to a remote place? We'll bring our checks, give him his money and leave. -He can go to hell. -And if he doesn't go to hell? What do we do? I'll kill him. Don't say a word. What took you so long? Why is your face bleeding? Did you get into a fight? This time, the check won't bounce. Then let's have a drink. No, we're in a hurry. Give us our old checks back and we'll go. What's the hurry? Let's have a drink. A toast to the inheritance. I want to know what happened to Dad. I can hear you. Didn't we agree on one million pounds? Is this one million for marrying Mona or for Abdel Rahman? What does Abdel Rahman have to do with it? Isn't he the man who died? It's so weird, the girl kills herself and her dad dies. -What a coincidence. -What can we say? It's fate. Hopefully, your fate will be better. Tell you what, Tarek. -I want ten million. -How much? -Ten. -Are you crazy? We had an agreement! We agreed on me marrying the girl, not on me killing anyone. -Mona killed herself! -Mona killed herself and her dad? Why do you care? God! You told me it was a small, simple operation. It turns out it's a big conspiracy, and I'm barely getting anything. This is all we can give. Take it or leave it. Let's go, Wessam. Great. You've made things easier for me. I'll make one call to the police and one to the medical examiner-- Calm down, Khaled. If you call the police, we'll all get in trouble. No, you'll be in trouble. I had nothing to do with it. You're asking for too much. Fine, I'll take nine million if you tell me how that man died. Tell you what, I'll give you two million, and that's all you'll get. -Ten. -You just said nine! Did you tell me how he died? -I made him overdose on his pills. -Nice. It's nine million now. Will the power be out for long? -Don't worry, it's probably just Mona. -Mona? -God! Didn't you tell her? -Tell me what? Don't mind him, he's lost his mind. Fine, man. I'll go check what's wrong. -What is it, Tarek? -Nothing, Wessam. Don't light it! Hello? Yes, Mona. Did you find Khaled, or was I right? No, you were right. It was just an illusion. Subtitle translation by Jessica Hikayem
