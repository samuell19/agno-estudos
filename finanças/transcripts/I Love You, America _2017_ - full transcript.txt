Well, we all know the big news yesterday: It ain't ogre till it's ogre. "Shrek" is getting rebooted. But, you know, everyone's gonna be covering that, so let's talk about the midterms. Here's what Trump said. It was a big day yesterday, an incredible day, and last night the Republican Party defied history. Shh. Not today, Satan. Even breaking up with Jeff Sessions for the tenth time won't distract us from this. Because whether you're talking "Shrek" or the midterms, it was a big night for donk‐ays! I'm usually not good at, uh, accents, but that was pretty good. Regardless of your party affiliation, we got a bunch of new faces in the House, and 33 of them are women. Yeah, sure, I don't agree with all of them, but I don't agree with all the women in my Lamaze class. They don't even think I should be there. I'm like, "I'm sorry I'm not pregnant." Plus, we elected the first openly gay governor, two Native American congresswomen‐‐ one of them gay‐‐ and two Muslim congresswomen‐‐ one of who will be the first to wear a hijab. This is a grab bag of Republican worst nightmares. It's like a congressional caravan. They could be hiding Middle Easterners and people with ethics in there. But I gotta hand it to Wisconsin Republican cheesedick Scott Walker. It looks like he lost, but he's taking it‐‐ what's the opposite of in stride? He retweeted this meme from your Aunt Carol who collects Precious Moments figurines and breeds Corgis. Let us be glad indeed. And we should be glad. Look at the big picture here. Democrats are so defeatist, they can't even act like they won when they won. They fucking won. And even in places where they lost, there were huge gains. Think of it this way, without Bernie's presidential loss, we wouldn't have had, uh, all these democrats pushing for a livable minimum wage or Medicare for all. And, yes, Beto lost in Texas, but his presence increased Democratic turnout statewide and flipped two House seats blue. Also, if we look at some of these Republican victories, are they really victories? I mean, we're talking several seats won by indicted criminals and racists funded by Nazis. Brothel owner Dennis Hof may have won a Republican seat in the Nevada State House this week, but he died, like, a month ago. Republicans literally elected a ghost pimp. But winning the House is an incremental victory. If you wanna compare that to something, and stay with me here, look at the Tea Party‐‐ minus the conspiracy theories and lack of decency and founding father cosplay, faux righteousness, and, you know, just open racism. They used to be the far‐right fringe. Then they fought, they persevered, and they took the House in 2010. And now they've become the GOP establishment. Let's be the left's version of the Tea Party. The Chai Tea Party. In on other way but their perseverance. This is a win, so let's celebrate. This is Red Bull, by the way. We still have a lot of work to do. All right, I fucking love you guys. Whoops. I Beto'ed. What a badass. Whelp, see you in a sec.

[laughter] Well, it was a crazy night across the nation, and no place was crazier than the shit show that is Florida. But while everybody was distracted by the fact that Andrew Gillum lost the governor's race to "proud boy with a job" Ron DeSantis, something good happened. Florida passed an amendment that restores voting rights for over a million ex‐felons, which is a really big deal because during the midterms, quite a few people‐‐ about 6.1 million people nationally‐‐ could not vote due to their criminal record. Which got me thinking, I have a criminal past. I have a history of criminal behavior. One day when I was 20, a friend and I were, uh, in a car filled with marijuana smoke. Said smoke came from within our lungs. [laughter] The next thing we knew, we got pulled over, but we were only a little bit scared because without knowing it consciously, in our bones, we were aware of our privilege. We rolled down the window and the stench of weed literally punched this cop in the face. [laughter] He told us to find the registration card while he went back to his patrol car to run our plates, but instead, we started to sing along to Tracy Chapman's "Fast Car" with coordinated dance. And when he knocked on the window, we were both like, "Gah!" We were so stoned and so privileged, we honestly forgot we had even been pulled over. And here's how the story ends: we got off with a warning. Nothing. We got to keep driving. Driving in her car. ♪ Speed so fast ♪ ♪ Felt like I was drunk ♪ Sorry. God, that is such a good song. I wish I could sing more, but we simply can't afford it. This is what it is like for white people. It is why we like cops. Some of us even wanted to be them when we grew up. At my small New Hampshire kindergarten, it was in the top three of things we wanted to be when we grew up‐‐ with firefighter and butt doctor. [laughter] But we didn't know that cops were white‐people protectors. I didn't realize that if we had been two young people of color, the outcome would likely have been very different‐‐ possibly leading to jail time, possibly changing the course of our lives forever. We definitely would not have gotten into butt doctor school. That is for sure. [laughter] And here's the thing, as a nation, we love to jail. The United States is only 5% of the total world population, but we incarcerate 25% of all the world's prisoners. We currently have 2.3 million people in jail. Our threshold for what is criminal is very low. Driving with a suspended license, jail. Cashing a bad check, jail. Slug with a shell on its back, snail. [laughter] That was a test. I was testing you to see if you were listening. We love to jail, and if you are a person of color, the chance you'll get arrested is exponentially higher. Everything about our justice system is uniquely designed to punish minorities and poor people. It just is. Take, uh, you know, minor drug charges. Half of all federal prisoners are in jail for drug offenses. Half. And even though African Americans and whites use drugs at similar rates, black people are six times more likely than white people to go to prison for it. If you're wondering what just happened to the rest of the white potheads in that graphic, don't worry about them. They're at a Dave Matthews concert. [laughter] ♪ We are white and entitled ♪ [laughter] That was really good. [sighs] Meanwhile, good old GOP John Boehner is now sitting on the board of a major weed distributor. That is right. The old, rich Republican who once said he was "unalterably opposed" to legalizing weed is now making money off of weed. The same drug that black and brown people are still in jail for under legislation he supported throughout his career. I would call it hypocrisy, but punishing minorities for doing the same shit old white men make money off of is basically the GOP platform. It is like if Mike Pence suddenly opened a chain of gay bars. [laughter] Oh, my God, he could go in by himself without Mother. [laughter] Okay, if we're talking about our absurdly racist and classist justice system, we cannot leave out cash bail. Under our current system, almost half a million people are waiting in jail for a trial that could take weeks or months or even years to begin. They are serving time before they've even been to trial. Guess who isn't in jail? People with enough money to post bail or hire a good lawyer. It is not "innocent until proven guilty." It is "guilty until proven not poor." Think about that. There are innocent people behind bars simply because they can't afford bail, and there are guilty people walking around freely because they can. Half a million people in jail are awaiting trial. To put that in context, Six Flags sells over 15,000 funnel cakes every single day. [clears throat] Okay, you know what? That is‐‐I don't think that's a good comparison. I don't know why I chose that. That‐‐that's not good. It seemed light and fun at the time. I don't know. The question we have to ask ourselves is: what is the purpose of prison? Because if it is to rehabilitate people, we are failing miserably. But if it's to make money off of bodies that we have trained ourselves to no longer see as human, then we're killing it. We lock up so many people, state prisons can't even hold them all. So the government pays private prisons to take the rest. And private prisons are a five billion dollar industry. Five billion motherfucking dollars. And the danger of this business being lucrative is that incentivizes putting people in prison and keeping them there. The more people they lock up, the more they get paid. And the private prison industry will continue to thrive under our "tough on crime" president. The prison industry and Trump scratch each other's backs and their mutual success is garnered on the backs of prisoners. Trump promised to reverse Obama's plan to phase out private prisons, and because of that, major private prison corporations like GEO Group and CoreCivic donated massive amounts of money to Republican PACs to get 'em elected, and they did. And the very day Trump was elected, the stocks of those two corporations shot up. It is evil. It is "other countries do this, not us" evil. But then you remember, we're the "rip children away from their mothers" country, and it all makes sense. [laughter] Trump thrives on fear. He's your protector and everyone else is a potential threat. Democrats, the media, minorities, facts. [laughter] He's even criminalizing refugees. He is turning a group of migrants seeking asylum into a fresh stream of "criminals." And guess what? There is money to be made there too. The private prison company GEO Group has over 470 million dollars in ICE contracts. And if we don't treat our own citizens well in prison, just imagine how we will treat undocumented immigrants. Trump wants you to see danger, but make no mistake, he is seeing dollar signs. Follow the money. GEO Groups top donations this year are to the three Texas congressmen who determine funding for immigration detention centers and private prisons. As long as there is money to be made in keeping people behind bars, we will find a way to call people criminals. In Los Angeles, it's currently against the law to sleep in your car. That's our solution to homelessness? How is sleeping a crime? People are their least dangerous when they're sleeping. Look at this little guy. [laughter] Aww. Aww, genocide is exhausting. [laughter] Look. I am a criminal. The amount of weed I smoked before legalization could fill a stadium, and yet black people and brown people are serving long sentences for doing what I do every single night before bed. I'm talking about smoking weed, not masturbating. Masturbation's illegal, then put me in cuffs. Just keep one arm free. [laughter] I guess that's probably not how cuffs work. Fuck it. I don't even need my hands. I'll just use the corner of my cot. [laughter] Our justice system upholds the status quo for the white and powerful, because in America, sleeping while homeless is a crime, walking while black is a crime, but being white and high off your ass in your stepfather's car is a childhood memory. [cheers and applause] You know, all trilogies need an epic conclusion. "Return of the Jedi." "Return of the King." Here is part three of my interview with President Trump, "Return of the Dipshit." Take a look. [dramatic music] Describe your perfect day. A perfect day is I wake up at 6:30 and I got a smooth one. Not some wet blast that blows me out of the toilet for, like, a half hour, you know? Right, right. TRUMP: Something that drops quickly, okay? Something big. Big boom. Like, you know, Hiroshima. One drop, and it's done. SARAH: Big boom‐boom. Big boom‐boom. I send some tweets, and then nobody bothers me for three hours. Oh, and I have cake for breakfast! I remember hearing a story about you picking up Don Jr. for a Yankees game and‐‐ Punched him right in the face. He showed up, and he was in his sweats. And I was in my suit. And I was like, "The hell are you doing? "We're going to the Yankees game. "Joe Torre's gonna be there. "Okay? Oil Can Boyd "and the guy from 'Field of Dreams.' You're embarrassing me." So I punched him right in the face, and he went back like it was, like that movie, "Something About Mary," just funny, just, he went back and fell. Well, I wish I could say it's been an honor, but it has been an interesting experience. And, um, thank you for... Sarah. So great to meet you. SARAH: Ugh. TRUMP: Wow, incredible. By the way, I got tons of upskirts while we were talking. I think you're abhorrent, and you break my heart, and I think you're a bad man with no ideology, and just human garbage to the core, and I really don't like to think of people that way, but I do think of you that way, and I do believe that, if there were hell, which there isn't, you would be going to hell.
