[projector whirring, epic music] [upbeat disco music] [music cuts out, bulb unscrewing] [bulb smashing, man screaming] [music continues] NARRATOR: Long ago in a faraway place... the beautiful island of Goola began sinking into the sea. All the creatures of Goola lived in helpless fear of the day when their island home would vanish under the waves. [all screaming] - Ah, not yet. - Oh, boy. [all sighing in relief] But they knew it would happen one day. [all screaming] - Ah... no. - Oh, yeah. [all chuckling in relief] Until an especially clever monkey named Moneke had a very big idea. He would build a great machine to harness the power of the volcano and all the fruit of Goola, and create a concoction that would keep the island afloat. When it was finished... [applause] [applause dies] [quirky music] [mechanical rumbling] [sputtering] [hissing] [rousing music] [gasping] [cheering] The machine worked better than anyone could have ever dreamed. [key jangling] And there Goola remained for generation after generation, safely above the water. Until one day... Moneke's amazing machine began to fail. [rumbling] [alarm blaring, frenzied shouting] Watch the pressure! [hissing] You! Get on that valve. Yes, sir. Ooh, out of my way! [grunting] [growling] [snarling] [thudding on door] Ooh! [screaming] Cheek, buddy. No need to crash the party. You might try being a little lighter on your feet. - [rumbling] - Oops. Be still my beating heart. - What's all that noise, anyway? - [alarm beeping] Yeah, that's it. You mind turning it down? [growling] Whoa, there, take a number, big boy. There's plenty of me to go around. The old ape wants to see you. The executive summons. Well, what do you know? I must have done something right. - Duty calls, girls. - [giggling] Always leave them wanting more, that's my motto. I can see it's yours, too. [laughing] [rumbling] Somebody should do something about that. [Digg humming] What do you know? This used to be the way to my uncle's office. I guess we'll just have to turn around. [Digg humming] - Out of the way, pork chop. - Oh, ah! - [screaming] - Huh? Now, that's what I call cheek to cheek. [clearing throat] Oh, pardon, oh, excuse me. Sorry, sir. Don't mention it. And keep up the good work. Say, don't I know you? [growling] I could fire you, ham hocks, but if this island sinks, we might need an extra float. - Ha! You think? - Ah, don't listen to him! I happen to like a fellow who enjoys life... a lot. For luck. [breezy music] Hey, Sal, baby. Long time, no see. [giggles] Piece of advice: you need to learn who really runs this company, and start spreading the sugar around, if you know what I mean. Oh! MONEKE: Ah, Peanut. Uncle Moneke! There you are. How did you know I was coming to see you today? Were you? Well, it's downright eerie when that happens. Like a sixth sense. Must be that family connection. Over here. That's better. Now, what can I do for you? Peanut, I'd like you to meet an honored citizen of Goola. Pink was one of the builders of the original Goola Juice processors. Great Goola! That makes you... [whistling] A humble servant of Goola. Pink is one of our family's oldest friends. Sure is. Pleasure to meet you. With a name like that, school must have been rough. Not for me. There's no one sharper than Pink. You don't say. I asked him to come out of retirement from the other side of the island to give us his perspective. I'm worried about the recent breakdown of the machines. We're working on it, sir, day and night. - [kissing noises] - Of course you are, Cheek. But we can use all the help we can get. He's right. There's anything I've learned from my uncle, it's that machines break down and we repair them, whatever it takes. This time is no different. "We?" When was the last time you got your hands dirty? I don't know. When was the last time we shook hands? [chuckles] Now, boys, it's time we faced facts. If we don't fix the problem soon. What went up is going to splash down. That's why I ordered an investigation into the frequency of incidents and malfunctions. If it involves getting our hands dirty, don't we have apes who do that? Getting your hands a little dirty now, Peanut, is good preparation for later. All this, my boy, will be yours. [peaceful music] Here's my lead investigator now. Everyone, this is Flo. Good morning. Very, very clever. You did it without telling me? It was important to get a fresh perspective. Flo, if you'd care to share your findings with everyone? Thank you. Gentlemen, the data clearly shows that in recent months, the frequency of incidents and malfunctions has dramatically gone up, while the island has gone down. We're falling faster than a ripe grapefruit. Looking closer, key indicators suggest that there is a pattern at work. [tense music] DIGG: Hmm. Uh-huh. Ah! [banging] Big, round, hungry? You want a sandwich? No. Big problem. One point for me. Next word. It's fun. Pointy... pineapple? Rock? Your pet rock is a pointy pineapple? Nah. Back to problem. Swimming? Boogie? What are you doing? Moving. Parts. Machine. Ah! Ha-ha. Problem. Machine. Problem machine! I got it! The machines all have one problem. - Why, yes. That's right. - Huh? We should be able to trace all of the incidents back to one central problem. I'm glad you see it, too. Oh, actually, it was... obvious, in a not-so-obvious sort of way, if you see what I mean. Why, yes, I do. Now we just have to find the problem. Excellent, Peanut. Now, hold the fruit. If there was a central problem, I would have found it. Pink, what do you say? Hmm. I'm with the big one on this. I don't see it. But how can you say that when it's so... - Obvious? - But what about the tremors? It's been quiet on my side of the island. The increased volcanic activity? Volcanoes are known to bubble and boil. And the fact that Goola is losing altitude. Ah, the excitability of youth. Then again, I can't see much of anything these days. My dear Moneke. It appears that I have nothing useful to contribute here. I'm afraid my time has passed. As mine soon will be, too, old friend. Don't say that! Yeah, we'd be lost without you. Sooner than you think. [snickers] I'll take my leave now. Thank you for your service. Stay sharp. Now, some of us can get back to work. Not so fast! Boys, at a time like this, we have to put aside our differences - and work together. - Don't we always? I'm glad you agree, because Flo and I have come up with a plan to deal with our dilemma. [rousing music] Not since the days of Moneke I has such a noble task been undertaken. Look at that. Just a little warm. Somewhere out there, something is causing our great Goola to sink, and this expedition must find what it is, or we are lost. - Yes, Peanut. - Uh... If the problem's somewhere out there, what are we doing up here? Ah... I salute you and I bid you all fruit speed. [lively music] You mean we're going in there? It's the fastest way to get around the island. Not to mention an early grave. Oh, it's not that dangerous. Almost all of our first volunteers have come back. That's almost reassuring. [both laugh] What is so funny? Uncle Moneke, I was thinking. You were saying? What this team really needs is a... coordinator. - A coordinator? - Exactly. Someone to remain behind in case of emergencies. [buzzing] And since I'm an expert at reading messenger mugs, I'll be able to send supplies or help when it's needed. There will be no help, Peanut. No help? No one must ever know about this. The citizens of Goola will panic just like before if they really knew how bad things are. - Very, very, very sensible. - Glad you agree. I'm a sensible fella. Don't miss your bubble. [grunting] [Cheek screaming] - [clanging] - Hey, buddy. Thanks for that tip back there, you made me look great. - Anything to help, sir. - You mean that? Sure, I do. You're all going to be heroes. In that case, throw that wrench in the machine. - Throw the wrench? - Do it! - In the machine? - Go on. - That's sabotage. - That's an order. - Uh-uh! - [laughs] You really had me going, sir, that's a funny one. - Give me the wrench. - Peanut! - What's the matter? - I don't do bubbles. Unless they're tiny and in champagne. Let's face it, I'm just not the monkey for this mission. Normally I'd agree with you. You should always trust your better judgment. But I would be wrong. Now, now, no, don't doubt yourself like that. Today, you showed me that you truly understand the complexities of our problem. Even Cheek couldn't see it. Oh, that. I've never been more proud. - [Chameleon groaning] - Gee, what can I say? I need you on this mission. When you put it that way... Hey, slow down there. What are you... Hey, what are you, huh? I thought we were friends here. I wish I could trade places with you, sir. Well, your wish is my command! - [plopping] - CHAMELEON: Wait a minute. - That was fun! - Bye-bye. - Ah! Aw, too tight. - [burps] - Oh, that's better. - Oh, great mother of Goola. What did you eat for lunch? - Flipping! - No, no, no, no, no. I don't want to know. Toodle-oo. Have a safe trip. There go my frequent flyer miles. Oh, oh! I'm feeling a little upset in the tummy. [Digg laughing nervously] No, I got it under control. I'm fine now, thanks. [Digg gagging] [both screaming] [quirky music] Ah! Oh, fruit. Hey, boy, you know, this isn't so bad, after all! [both screaming] DIGG: This is so cool! We're going outside the city! Didn't anybody ever tell you it's dangerous outside the city? Ah, at least we're in here? Sure. Safely inside a giant speeding bubble. - I feel better already. - Hey, look! At least there'll be witnesses when this thing pops. Hey, hey. What's he doing? Maybe she has something in her eye. In a pig's eye, she does. Come on, we've got to get this thing over there. - How? - There! There, lean into it. That cheeky monkey. - Now what? - Left! Lean left. Right. Right. Left. Now we're moving. Aha! We meet again. This is it. Get ready. Aye, aye, sir! Now, full chops to the right! - [Flo and Cheek yelling] - Mission accomplished. - DIGG: Whoo! - FLO: What was that? Not bad, kid. Where'd you learn to handle a bubble like that? - In the bathtub, sir. - And say no more. DIGG: Yes, sir. CHEEK: I should have known. - Peanut? - And the Pig? That's more like it. Look how happy she is to see me. DIGG: I don't know. [gasping] What, are you kidding? She's totally captivated. Could be something else. Ah, what do you know about sheer animal magnetism? - It's big. - That's true. - Huge. - Now you're making sense. - Hot, hot! - Smoking hot! - It's a volcano! - It's a volcano. Hey, I like that. It's a volcano! [yelling] That's what I said. well, you call that an excuse? We're headed right for it. [suspenseful music] We have to go left. Wrong way, wrong way, wrong way, wrong way. I said left. - That was left. - The other left. - This is all your fault. - My fault? Why didn't you use your "animal magnetism"? I'll use it later. Right now, run! [Pig yelping] Don't breathe, Digg, Digg, don't breathe. [both yelling] - DIGG: Whoa, whoa! - PEANUT: Here we go. - [Peanut screaming] - Sorry! - Get off! - I'm trying. - I'm hatched already. - That tickles. - Stop. - You stop! No, we have to stop. Now! [suspenseful music] [both screaming] DIGG: Whoa, whoa, oh, whoa! Pop it! We're doomed! You gotta admit, that's some thick Goola Juice. Oh, my tummy. [burps] You did it! [both screaming] Hold on. [Pig wailing] We make it thick, so it'll stick. [Pig yelping] Ah! You saved us. You saved me. Yeah, well, don't mention it, to anyone. We wouldn't want people to talk. Does this mean we're friends? You see anybody else around here? No, sir. Now, let's find a way outta here. Short and sweet. Bubble burst, trapped inside volcano, send help. [electronic beeping] "And food? "Preferably apple flaps, Fruity Jacks, and a juice chaser "if you have room, over and out. "PS, a fruit tart would be nice, too." Go quick before he asks to see the chef. Hey, what's your name anyway? You can call me Digg, or you can call me Pig. Now you can call me P or D, or double-wide on the side, but don't you ever call me late for dinner! Ah, I had to ask. Somebody, save me. [stomach grumbling] Hey, you mind turning that down? We're lost. [gasping] That's a perfect way to get found. BOTH: This way! BOTH: That way? There is only one way to settle this.

How could something like this happen, sir? - It's terrible. - You're telling me. That song never fails. I sing, she swoons. Woo, woo, woo. Do you know what this means? I could be losing my touch. Say it ain't so. It's not a malfunction at all. - Keep talking. - It's sabotage. I think I see where you're going. That's how the bats know about the machines. Machines? Who cares about the machines? We're talking about me. How could they do this to Goola? We need reinforcements. Everyone needs to know what's going on here. But I thought everybody knows? No, no, nobody knows. - About our plan? - About their plan. Don't you listen to anything? [wind howling] FLO: Maybe we should go looking for them. There's no time for that. You said it yourself. The fate of Goola hangs in the balance. I know, I know, I did the calculations. I just hope wherever they are, they're safe. We have to face facts. Anything could have happened.

They've been monkeying around with the old machines to disrupt the system. I'll have, you know, that figure of speech is offensive, and entirely accurate. Why would the bats want to disrupt the system? Hmm, they were there when we originally built it. There have been rumors the bats are unhappy that Goola City isn't sharing enough fruits of their labor. You two, have done very good work indeed. - [yelling] - [gasping and screaming] - [ballet music plays] - [grunting in pain] [screaming] Congratulations. If all the fruit bats are in on it, we're going to need a much bigger team to root them out. In that case, I'll lead you back to Goola City. We better send a messenger beetle back so Moneke can start preparing. Good idea. Fireworks, fruit sculptures, a ticker tape parade. There's a lot to organize for a hero's return.

Leap, swing, and totally outmatched. [♪♪♪] Oh, great. Hey, stick around, will ya? What's he doing? [mushroom creature roaring] Come on, come on, come on, come on, over here. All aboard! Peanut, that's brilliant. I figure bunnies like to hop. Hold this for me. First class all the way. [romantic music] [screaming] - Boopsie. - [chuckles] Oops! Oops! I'll show you, oops! [mushroom creature screaming] - You're riding? - I'm there. [♪♪♪] [both screaming] Fancy meeting you here. - Touchdown. - Anybody ever tell you you have a future in cannonballs? Let's find Flo! There she is. I got you. We hope you enjoyed your flight today. It really worked. I prefer flying jumbos myself. - This pig can fly. - Oh, shucks. Hey, it's Mr. Pink. - CHEEK: You! - That's right. We made it out. No thanks to you. I saw the bats drop him. He needed my help. Oh, are you hurt? [chuckles] No. Just old, my dear. PEANUT: Good thing I held on to this. Ah, my trusty. Thank you. We were just coming to find you. Luckily for us, we had Peanut. He sure saved my bacon. Your uncle would be proud. Don't get carried away. Once was enough, I assure you. I was just saving my own skin. Now we know you were right about the bats. They obviously used me to try and trap you. [growls] Let's get moving. [♪♪♪] Ew! Don't be sweating on me, hog! B... b... but it's so hot. That's some spring in your step, Mr. Pink. Oh, yes, the volcanic warmth agrees with me. [chuckles] Look at that! Is that a bromance in the making I see? I'm starting to get a funny feeling about all this. Me too. Something stinks. - That's just you. - [sniffs] Oh yeah. What do we really know about that old sloth anyway? He's one of the original Goola founders and a living legend. Oh, that! [♪♪♪] Now, I know what they mean by if you can't stand the heat, stay out of the volcano. What's the matter? Can't you take it? Well, you know, it's not the heat, it's the stupidity. I think we're going deeper into the volcano. Away from Goola City. It's just lava pockets. We have to pass through them on the way out. Ah, see there. The journey is almost over. Where are we? Not the exit that's for sure. [gasps] The Central Cone! Did I mention I have a nose for danger? That looks like the Goola juice bubble maker. PEANUT: Only that's no juice bubble. That's lava. [machinery whirring] DIGG: The lava bubbles are so heavy they're weighing down the entire system. They're what's causing the island to sink. Let's get out of here. We have to tell Uncle Moneke. - [stone crumbling sound] - [ominous music] Whoa! Now that's an avalanche! Hey! The boulder almost flattened me! Flattened us, you mean? [chuckles] Sorry about that, Boss! Boss? You? [Pink laughs maniacally] And you! You're all in on the secret plot together. Not bad for an old fossil, eh? It was just a matter of modifying some of the original Goola machinery that had been abandoned. - But why? - [mockingly] Oh. But why? Because I saved Goola, it was me. - I built all these machines. - Impressive. [exclaiming in pain] Ah! Just saying. But your great grand-ape took all the credit and all the glory. You monkeys live like kings. While all I got was a golden pineapple and a pat on the back! No one knows what I built, but they'll know when I destroy it. What do you mean destroy it? That wasn't part of the deal. - No? - [tutting] Always a little late to the party aren't you, my boy? That is why I chose you. We were only supposed to make them think the island was sinking. Then we'd save everyone and rule Goola together. [evil laughter] As if I would share power with another cheeky monkey. - Never! - [Pink laughs maniacally] You betrayed me. Don't take it so hard. You betrayed me and we... - never mind. - But if the island sinks what about all the Goola fruit you promised us? Don't you see? He tricked all of you. Everyone. - No fruit? - No juice? No anything. [Cheek growling] [Cheek screaming] [Cheek grunts] [Pink laughs maniacally] You didn't think I was planning to go down with the rest of the island, did you? After Goola sinks, I will rebuild on the volcano that remains. [loud rumbling] [tense music] [klaxons blaring] WORKER: Hurry, Hurry, hurry! MONEKE: Let's go, let's go! CHAMELEON: Stupid. This is not my job. [♪♪♪] Revenge is the sweetest fruit of all. PEANUT: Wait a minute, didn't you forget something? - PINK: Pardon? - Um, uh... I'm too young to die? - Goodbye! - Stop him! [Cheek grunting] [laughs evilly] - Target acquired. - Locked and loaded. Dive, dive, dive! Ouch. What are we doing? - Huh? - We got wings. Oh, so? Oh! Let's get out of here. You're smarter than you look, Fufu. [dramatic music] We have to climb. Guys, guys. Guys! - What's the matter? - Pigs can't climb Last I heard they can't fly, either. Hey, yeah! let's get shakin' bacon. Yeah. After you, sir. Huh? Yah-hoo! There we are, all for one and one for all. That's my motto. Since when? Since right now. There's nowhere left to go. I hope that works out for you. So this is it. Somehow, I always imagined when the end finally came, I'd be somewhere else. Come on. We can't let this beat us. What can we do? We can look death in the eye. We can laugh. [forced laughter] - We can kiss. - Well... Oh, great Goola! Hurry up and end it! What? I don't think, this pipe is load-bearing. - Who cares? - But... but... but... - Kind of busy. - It might... You ever hear the phrase now or never? Break. [all screaming] PEANUT: Bubbles. Gotcha. They're too small. Stop grabbing! Let them stick to you. [quirky music] Phew. Madam, how do you do? Oops. [screaming] [blowing] It's working. We're alive? [cheering] - [farting] - That's right. I fly all the time! PEANUT: If we had booked early, we could have gotten better seats. - FLO: Oh, Peanut. - Did someone say peanuts. CHEEK: Nuts! You're all nuts! - Look! - It's going down. Uncle Moneke. [crowds screaming] - Oh, dear! - I don't know how to swim. FLO: Everyone. - Well, at least we made it. - [laughs] - [popping sound] - [cries out in surprise] We have to do something. Do what? It's all over. It really is over. Now I'll never get the penthouse office. It's not over. It's not over unless we give up. And unless you're not the monkey I think you are. You'll never give up, you're too obtuse to give up. You think I'm obtuse? Hm... Getting your hands a little dirty now, Peanut, is good preparation for later. We need to go that way. Can you do it? No problem. I got a full tank. - [farting] - CHEEK: What are you doing? - We have to break the machines. - Are you crazy? You'll get us all killed. - [farting] - [clanking] CHEEK: That was a mistake. This is how you break something. You two don't know what you're doing. I'll show you how to disable this machine. - [Cheek laughing] - [Digg farting] [clanging] [Cheek laughing] Let's do it! - Back it up, Pig! - Okeydokey, sir. [loud belching] I still have faith in Peanut. - I don't know how to swim. - Pink? [Pink laughs maniacally] [all grunting and talking over each other] FLO: It's working. [Pink laughing maniacally] [gasping] What? CHEEK: Ooh! [indistinct] fun! [clanging] [everyone grunting and yelling] If we get this, it should finish off the whole system. PINK: I don't think so. I won't let you stop what I've begun. You're too late. This is the beginning of the end. Or the end of the end. Or maybe it's the end of the beginning? Eat lava, monkey boy! [screaming] DIGG: My bacon is baking. PEANUT: I hope it's true that girls like fried bananas. DIGG: Do you think this is covered in Goola's health plan? PEANUT: Are you kidding? No way. I know. I wrote it. Hey! We're steering it! Other way, other way. No. Yes. - No. - Sir. They are heading for the lava! - PEANUT: Right, go right. - DIGG: Go right. - PEANUT: My left. - DIGG: Go left? - PEANUT: Right! - Oh, no! Cheek, jump! - [Cheek grunts] - FLO: Whee! PEANUT: I said left. DIGG: You said right! [♪♪♪] [splashing and sizzling] Peanut! You got any marshmallows? - Going up. - [machinery pops] I know these machines better than anyone. [high pitched whirring] PEANUT: Next floor lingerie, sporting goods, and deadly lava balls. Looks like we're having a special run on those lava balls. Oh, fruit! No! Buddy, I said, we make it thick so it'll stick. Ow! Oh. Flying gets easier and easier. - Partner? - Partners. [both yelling] Charge! Now try and stop me. [grunts exasperatedly] [♪♪♪] You asked for it! ♪ Goola, Goola fruity treat ♪ ♪ For blocking lava can't beat me ♪ ♪ Especially when I use my seat ♪ No! [♪♪♪] [nails screeching] PEANUT: This way. [suspenseful music plays] [rumbling] [♪♪♪] It stopped! BOTH: Hooray! [♪♪♪] [Pink grunting] - PEANUT: Oh, no. - Oh please. Well, you got to hand it to the big chimp. BOTH: Nah. [thumping] [tense music] [claws clanging metallically] [roars menacingly] [rumbling] [♪♪♪] [both screaming] [Pink yelling] PEANUT AND DIGG: Incoming! [Pink yelling] Jump! Hey, what the fruit are you doing? - No problemo. - Yes problemo. [thudding] [Pink sputtering] [crashing] Peanut! They're okay. That is one lucky monkey. [laughs] - Nice work, pig. - Why thank you, monkey. [screaming] Lookout! - [babbling] - [yelling] [Pink screaming] [laughs] Why you...! This isn't finished! You want to bet? [Pink sputtering] PINK: No! [screaming] He's in the juice now. About time he got canned. Now what? FLAP: Need a lift? You came back. What's the catch? She's kind of sweet on you. [chuckling] [Flip giggling] Well, you can't blame her. Not you, banana breath. Him! - Me? - Him? I like the strong, silent type. [Flip giggling] - Oh, I see. - Still friends? [gentle music] - [Digg humming happily] - [sniffs] [humming] [sniffing] The nose knows. [quirky music] - [Pink scoffing] - Why? I had enough of playing second banana to a bunch of simple minded simians. I'm sorry, old friend, but I order you to further service Goola City. You will help restore it to its former glory by cleaning up the mess you made. You order me? - [bones cracking] - [locomotive hissing sound] - [high pitched whimpering] - Uncle Moneke is a bad... [heroic music plays] Congratulations to you all for saving Goola City. - Ah, about that. - Yes, Peanut? We can do better than that. [♪♪♪] [rumbling] [♪♪♪] [cheering] [♪♪♪] [cheering] Peanut, today, I am proud to be a monkey's uncle. [laughter and cheering] Now this belongs to you. Ooh! Gee. [Cheek groaning] Hey crybaby, get back to work. Uncle Moneke, what can I say? I made a copy for myself years ago. [Moneke laughing] Oh, you cheeky monkey. [cheering] NARRATOR: Not so long ago, the beautiful island of Goola began sinking into the sea until a particularly clever monkey and his friends saved the day. - Hold the fruit! - [record scratching] Aren't you forgetting something? That's more like it. [smooching sound] - DIGG: Pardon me. - Hey, buddy. My buddy. Mind if I cut in? - Well... - Of course.
