Mom! Mom! Oh, God. Is the Bantul Nurul Huda mosque still far away? No. God, please bless my mother's soul. In the name of God... You'll see Panggung Krapyak. It's called Kandang Menjangan. There, keep heading south. It's not far from here. Just ask around when you get there. -Thank you, sir. -Yes. You're welcome. Har, come on. Nice! Our boss is already awake. Pras, would you like to take over for a while? He just woke up! He's still dazed. He could get us killed. Watch your words! Words are prayers. God forbid. It's okay. Let me drive. Good. You are understanding, Pras. Now it's my turn to contemplate the Indonesian economic situation. You want to sleep, but you talk too much. You're so fussy! Kids! Who wants to listen to the tale of Madaniah? -Me! -Gather around. Come on. -Come on, let's hear it. -Slowly. Amran, we're in Krapyak. Where should we go from here? Mother... -What happened? -Pras! -Watch out! -Mother! Mind your own life when you help someone, okay? -We have no time for this. Come on. -Mother Dedeh. -Where are you heading to? -The mosque. The mosque? Okay, show us the way. Pras, we have to... Bring his bike. Pras, you know how important this observation is for our graduation, right? The mosque will determine whether or not we'll become architects this semester. Let's not waste time on this kind of thing. Go ahead, I'll catch up. Just go there first and take some pictures. I'll take care of this first. -Take care of him! -What's this? Who are you? Pras, who is this? Pras! On a sunny day, at the house of Madaniah and her father, Madaniah asks her father, "Father, how can I go to heaven?" Pray five times a day, read The Holy Quran. What? Pray five times a day, read The Holy Quran. -Peace be with you. -Peace be with you, too. Hasbi? Hasbi, what's the matter? -I fell from my bike. -Oh, God. Are you all right? I'm okay, Miss Arini. This man helped me. Peace be with you. Peace be with you too. -Thanks for helping Hasbi. -Yes. You have to be more careful next time. I was careful, Miss. You were? Okay then. Did you pray before leaving home? -I was careful. -Did you pray before leaving home? Let's continue with our tale. Madaniah makes a promise to her father. "Father, I promise. I'll always pray for you and mother, so you both will go to heaven." Heaven is a place for... You're taking too much time with this thing! Oh, my God. -She's truly an Indonesian beauty. -And heaven is... This romance will cost me my graduation. Pras, when you find someone like her, you should propose to her immediately. Marry her and make it official, Pras. Married? Come on, let's go. You guys go ahead. I want to make sure Hasbi is fine. You're sneaky. Propose to her. Come on! So, kids, heaven is a place for people who are always grateful and also for people who are always sincere. Would you like to wash up before prayers? And also... You can do it over there. Yes. Right... By the way, I'm Prasetya. I'm Citra Arini. You can call me Arini. "Heaven is a place for people who are always grateful and sincere." What a beautiful line. Thank you. Sir. You want to be the one, right? What? That fast? We do need to pray soon, right? Oh, God! You meant the one to lead the prayers? Yes, of course. Be careful when you cross the street. Hasbi, don't run. So, we'll go to your place, right? Not now. -Why? -I promised my mom I would accompany her. -Hasbi, don't run yet, okay? -There is your prince charming. -Peace be with you. -Peace be with you too. Sita, you're so annoying. Come here. Meet my best friends. -Hi, Sita. -Hello. -Amalia. -Prasetya. Lia's house is near mine. In the Muntilan area. Only 30 minutes from Yogyakarta. So, if we go to our campus, we go together. Right, Li? Yeah, and when it gets late, they stay over at my house, in the city. And get a taste of being city girls. Right? You're annoying. By the way, may I have your number? Don't make a mistake. Too many zeroes. Ouch! -Thank you. -You're welcome. How do I get to the Bantul Nurul Huda Mosque? -Bantul? -Yeah, which way should I go? Just a moment. Sir, please take him to the Bantul Nurul Huda Mosque. Sure. I have to leave now. -Take care. -Thanks. -Peace be with you. -Peace be with you too. I think I'm going to sell some prepaid phone cards. It seems there'll be some extremely loyal customers. -Can I invest? -I want to. -Peace be with you. -Peace be with you too. How're you doing, Arini? -Kids, who can... -Praise God, I'm fine. And you? I'm good. How is Hasbi? Thank God, he's fine. He's well and healthy. He can run around already now. He's my assistant now. He brings puppets everywhere. Thank you, Hasbi. Kids, after this, I will tell you the tale of Madaniah! Why do you love storytelling so much? Storytelling is my way to give. Through tales, I can educate children. You're smart and poetic. You're just sweet-talking me. Pras, what do you like to do? I like drawing buildings. Hotels? Apartments? Schools, dorms, Islamic schools, and mosques. Orphanages. That's my favorite. Really? Why? I am an orphan. Oh, God. Sorry, I didn't know. It's okay, Arini. I hope you become a famous architect. I don't want to be famous. I want to make the world around me a better place unlike my past. Well, then I hope all your dreams come true. Amen. I remember when you were a child. You're serious about that Solo guy? You mean Pras? Are you serious? You're sure he'll be a good man for you? Who can guarantee whether a person is good or not? It's up to us to believe in them. And... You trust him? With your blessings. Well, then I'm relieved. You're serious with him. Thank you, Arini, for believing in me. I don't have anything to make you happy, except myself. For me, happiness is not given. But we can create our happiness by trusting each other. That is our heaven. If God permits, I will create our heaven with you. Amen. Don't ever hurt Arini. Long will you live Long will you live -This is for you, Mom. -Sweetie. Kids, let's eat. Hi, here is the birthday princess. Happy birthday. -Happy birthday, darling. -Thank you. Why are you only with Sybil? Where's your husband? Busy. Let's not talk about it, I'll get annoyed. Nadia, guess what I brought you. Give it to her, sweetie. What do you say? -Thank you. -You're welcome. Hon, there are special guests there. Who? Just wait for a while. -Let's play. -Go play. Sita, when will you marry? Don't date for too long. Rumors could start. -Peace be with you, Muslimin. -Peace be with you too. Please take a seat. -Please take a seat. -Thanks. Mom! Last night, I prayed for you, so that I can get a little brother to accompany the princess. Pras, this is big money, it can cover our operational costs for the coming year. Why... RECONSIDER CHILDREN'S LITERATURE Har, if that mall is built, markets in a five-kilometer radius will die. Small merchants will lose their income. WHO SAYS TALES ARE NOT LITERATURE? Pras, we are architects, not a charity. Why should we think about the poor? If this country suddenly becomes poor, is that also our responsibility? If we can't solve a problem, let's at least not make it worse. -How is the permit process going? -Not done yet. -The headman is asking for more money. -I don't care. This has to be approved! Let's vote. What do you think, Ran? We don't need to vote. I agree with Pras. -Explain that. -The headman... Sir, which dress do you choose for Mrs. Arini? Blue, pink, beige. -Pretty. -Okay, thanks, sir. Please take care of that, okay? Let's go outside. Hasbi, could you gather the kids? Tell them to step forward one by one. Ask them to share their experience. When they're done, write it down here and give it to me, okay? -Okay. -Thanks. What's wrong with you, Li? Li? I'm going to ask Rifai for a divorce. Oh, God. Why? Look at this. In room 205. Thanks for that night, honey. As a wife, how do you think I feel when I read such messages? Every time I ask, there's always a reason. He said his friend used his phone. Does that make any sense to you? For this kind of message! Does he think I'm a fool? Have you tried talking to him? Talk about what? The proof is clear. Maybe his friend did borrow his phone. Impossible, Sita. Don't be such a fool. Calm down, Li. Don't think negatively about your husband. You can say that because your husband loves you. He's faithful, unlike my husband. Heading to Grandpa's house. Why don't you come along, Dad? I want to tell tales with Grandpa. I'm sorry, Princess. I have to go to Kulon Progo to check my bridge over there. I'll join you this Saturday, okay? Don't be upset please. I'll meet you there. Be careful, okay? You're the one who should be careful. What's wrong with you? I'm worried about my best friends. Lia is having a problem with her husband. And Sita... I don't know. I'm worried that... Don't be negative. You think I'm a player? I only want you. Honey, I'm going, okay? Peace be with you. Peace be with you too. I'll join you for sure. Be with your father first. -Bye, Princess. -Bye, Dad. Take care of your mom. -Bye, Dad. -Bye, Dad. Bye, Mommy. Bye, Princess. Why isn't the permit issued yet? It's going to be too late. Never mind, I'm on my way. You deal with... Hello? Ran? Amran? Darn, I forgot to charge it. What's your problem? Help! Help! There's no ID. The police are investigating it. I don't want to bother Arini, but... Yeah, I'll call her after this. Okay. Thanks, Ran. -Mr. Prasetya? -Yes, Doc? We have to perform a C-section. -What? Pregnant? -Aren't you her husband? No, I'm not. Then, who will be responsible for all of this? Just go ahead, Doc. I'll be responsible. Okay, sir. Nurse, prepare the OR. Okay, Doctor. "Yes, because I see those ants are crossing the street. Don't let them get crushed." Grandpa, Mom said Prophet Solomon could talk to animals. He could. Why isn't Pras coming? He's working on his project in Kulon Progo. -Yes? -This is the patient's phone. I found it in her dress. Okay. Thanks. ME MYSELF Meirose. Yeah, you, Dad. I know you're paralyzed. But don't make that an excuse to forget about your sins towards me and Mom. Happy birthday, Meirose I can't believe you left me on my 12th birthday. I waited all day, Dad. All day. And you didn't come. HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MEIROSE Imagine how sad I was, especially when I looked at Mom. Ever since you left, many different men came into her room. Her room was filthy, dirty. And I was all alone. I had to get through all that by myself, Dad. Darn you! And you were not there when she died. You were not there. Imagine how I felt, Dad. I was alone. I was alone. I had nothing to hold on to. I was promised marriage, but then he left me. I don't know what else to do, Dad. I don't know where to go. Now, I'm pregnant and... Help me, Dad. I need you, but you aren't here for me. I can't be here anymore, Dad. I'm sorry. Good bye. -Mr. Pras. -How'd it go, Doc? The mother and the baby are in good health. Praise God. It's a boy. A boy? The baby and the mother are still unstable. Let's just pray for the best. Hope everything works out well. Amen. Thanks, Doc. You have to be strong. Excuse me, sir. What do you want to name the baby? -Akbar. -Akbar, sir? Akbar who? -Akbar Muhammad. -Akbar Muhammad, sir? You have to be tough. You must become a great person. God is great. Mom! Mom! Meirose? From where you're standing, it's 19,5 meters to the ground. If you only weigh 50-55 kilograms, there's a chance you might fall, but not die. Disabled, for sure. Who are you? Don't come any closer! I'm Prasetya. I brought you here. Why are you meddling in my life? I know about your life, Mei. I know how it feels to have a birthday without parents. -I know how it feels to be abandoned. -Good. -So, just let me die. Okay? -Mei, please. Please, listen to me. My mom took her life in front of me. Your newborn baby will have the same fate as us. History will be repeated, Mei. I don't care, okay? I don't care. After months of pregnancy and pain, now I have to take care of the baby? -You won't do it alone. -No. If you want to be a good woman, God will send a good man for you. Men? Forget it. -Later, that man will-- -I don't want to hear it! All men are the same. Always hiding behind the word "Later." Mei! No, Mei! No, Mei! No! I swear to God, I'll be by your side. I promise. -I promise. I swear to God. -Liar! Let me go! Mom! Mei! Forgive me. Let me go. Mei, I'll marry you. -Mei. -Let go! Mei, I'll marry you. -Liar! -I swear to God! I'll marry you, right now. I swear to God. Come on up. Mom... I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah. I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. You're mad, Pras. Mad! I understand, Har. If you understand, why should you-- Enough, Har. Let it go. Pras is not wrong. Here, read the Letter of An-Nisa. "And if you fear that you will not deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry those that please you of other women, two or three or four..." Read the Letter of An-Nisa, will you? Don't read it partially. Read the whole chapter. "But if you fear that you will not be just, then marry only one." Just one. Continue reading. Verse 129. "And you will never be able to be equal in feeling between wives, even if you should strive to do so. So do not incline completely toward one and leave another hanging." That's verse 129. I know the consequences of my decision. And that's between me, God and Arini. Pras, just be honest. You like Meirose, don't you? Har, I don't even know her. This isn't about whether or not I like her. This marriage is only intended to save a life. If you want to save her, just save her. If there's something wrong, take her to the hospital. Do you know how it feels to see someone commit suicide in front of you? Let it go! The marriage is done. Now it's Pras' business. Don't interfere. You talk so much. You are wasting your breath. Here, a cracker for you. One order of fried noodles. -Yes, sir. -With egg. I named him Akbar Muhammad. He survived for you, Mei. Before things get complicated, you'd better divorce her. Explain it to Meirose nicely. Then, leave her. Pretend all of this never happened. Meirose is a woman, too. She has rights. I can't just divorce her. Please oversee the Kulon Progo project, okay? -Pras. -Please help take care of Mei. She's still unstable. -Peace be with you. -Peace be with you too. I'm sure this will be a mess. Then we're the ones who will pay the price. Be positive. You have God. I promise to take good care of Arini and love her completely, sir. -Peace be with you. -Peace be with you too. Why didn't you call us? Sorry, darling. I didn't have time yesterday. Where are you now? On my way to Muntilan. I'll be waiting. Dad's gone. His heart. Daddy. Rini, your father is a good man. And I understand his reasons. Do we have to help people by marrying them? Isn't there any other way? Other options? Your father was fair. Fair? By hiding his second wife for 15 years? And by hurting his daughter. You call that fair? What kind of fairness? -How can this be called fair? -Rini! You won't betray me, right? We'll be like this forever, right? Honey, there'll only be the two of us, right? There'll be no one else, right? Let me. When will you tell your wife? I'll talk to her as soon as possible. She's the jealous type? I'm ready to be yelled at. Don't be negative. You don't know Arini. By the way... PRAYER GUIDELINES You're asking me to wear this? -Chubby? -No. You're more beautiful like this. Does every Muslim woman have to wear the hijab? Why are you taking it off? Do I have to wear it at home? -And I don't need this. -Why? You said you're the one for me. Then you should teach me. Okay? Okay. Check the names and the addresses of those who have already transferred. They've already ordered the book. Don't miss any details. So the plan is, we release it before Ramadan. I want Arini's second book to be ready for children to read during the month of Ramadan. So they can read it while fasting. Rin? Yes, I agree. I agree. Honey, why do you look so tired? The permit for our Kulon Progo project hasn't been approved yet. Everything is delayed. -So it'll be over budget? -True. Don't you know? Arini's father committed polygamy. That kind of thing makes me afraid to marry. You won't be like that, will you? No way. Do I look like someone who intends to practice polygamy like Amran? No way. How would I know? Men... What's the guarantee? Try this. This is the first time I have cooked for someone else. Okay? You really cooked this yourself? You don't believe it? -Auntie? -Yes, sir. Mei cooked this herself? Yes, sir. This is so delicious. Like eating at my own home. -What do you mean? -Sorry. That's not what I meant. I mean, the chicken, the ingredients, the meat... I've never eaten... You mean, it's like Arini's cooking? It's okay. I'm not angry. That means I can make you love me more. You're staying here tonight? Keep me company? Just a second. -Hello? -Peace be with you. Peace be with you too. Where are you? You can come home early, right? I'm cooking your favorite dish. -Yes, darling, but-- -You're busy, aren't you? -Yes. -It's okay. When you get home, I'll warm up the food. Okay. -Peace be with you. -Peace be with you too. Until when will we be like this? The timing is not right. Arini's father has just passed away. Just be patient. I can be patient. But a cover-up, even for a good reason, will look bad. And I don't want that to happen to you. Come on in. Come. What's happening? You said two weeks. But the asphalt isn't done yet. It's raining all the time. And the local people keep bothering us. Pras, have you talked to Meirose? Why are you meddling in his marriage? Our work isn't done yet. Just think about your own marriage. For me, marriage is a commitment. Before you can commit, you'd better not talk about marriage. Stop! Stop talking about it. We have been delayed by a month. Are you aware? Amran. Tell the foreman, if the asphalt extraction isn't done by tomorrow, we'll find another foreman. Everything is behind schedule! -Peace be with you, Mei. -You did this. Me? Because of him, everything is a mess. Because of polygamy, all our work is falling apart. Don't act as if you have been married for decades. You're still afraid of making a commitment. All you men think of polygamy? -What is polygamy? -Moron, you don't know? -That's Polygamy. -It's a bicycle brand? Sorry for being late. Hartono is using my car. -I finally got a motorbike taxi. -It's okay. His turn for immunization hasn't come, right? Not yet. PHARMACY It's 350,000. -Do you accept debit cards? -It's offline. If you want to pay cash, there's an ATM outside. The ATM's on the left. Okay. I'll get some money. Welcome. May I help you? Do you have any Biolysin? -Please take a seat. I'll get it. -Thanks. He's so cute. Hello. Ma'am, the medicine is ready. Here it is. Please pay at the cashier. Thanks. Thanks. 50,000. Thanks. Ma'am, there's a letter inside sir's pocket. -Thanks, Auntie. -You're welcome. -Hello. Good morning. -Good morning. I'm sorry to bother you. I would like to ask if there is any medicine for Akbar Muhammad Prasetya from Dr. Anita Ekowati? I'm sorry, where are you from? I'm from the pharmacy. There was some medicine missing yesterday. I would like to deliver it today. Could I have the address and phone number? Okay. Just a moment. He's been having a fever since last night. That's normal. After immunization, babies always have a fever. Just relax. While he's being breast-fed, he doesn't need any medicine. Because mother's milk is the most potent medicine from God. -It has to be dry. -Okay. Hello. Peace be with you. Hello? -Hello? -Who is it? There's no one there. Hello? How long have you two been married? -Since Akbar was born. -What? So all this time, you and my husband have been committing adultery? It's not like that. Akbar is not Pras' flesh and blood. I met him-- Whatever the reason, the fact is you married my husband. Here's what happened. He stopped me from committing suicide. -Now he's teaching me religion-- -By marrying you? You are amazing. Amazing! I knew you would be angry. I'm willing and ready to be considered an adulterer. Of course! One thing you must know. You've succeeded in destroying my fairy tale just to build your own. I'm sorry-- About our project... There are eight pillars that will sustain the bridge. And-- Peace be with you, Mei. Sorry, I'm still in a meeting. And this asphalt can last for about-- -Mbok. -Yes, sir. -Where's Madam? -She's upstairs, sir. Rin? -How could you? -Rin, I can explain. You promised me! -Listen-- -You promised! -Don't touch me! -Just listen to me, Rin. -Go away! -Just hear me out first. You all cannot be trusted! You all cannot be trusted! -Oh, my God. Where did I go wrong? -Arini, listen to my explanation. Mei was devastated. She wanted to commit suicide. She's an orphan, just like me. Good! Then you should be with her and not with me. Just go be with her. -Arini, listen! -Enough! The more you explain, the more my heart hurts. You've destroyed the heaven we built together. And I don't even long for that heaven anymore. -I want to go. -Rin, give me one chance to explain. -I want to get out of here. -Okay. I'll go. This is my mistake. See? I've been telling you it'd end up like this. If only Pras listened to me... Har, if you use the word "if only," it means you're not grateful. Whatever. The point is, it's all messed up. And it'll be hard to fix this. It will take time. -Hello. -Honey? Yes. -Sir, there's a letter from Mr. Richard. -No. Yes. -Are we still on for lunch? -Yes. Now? Okay, I'll wait for you. -I'll be there right there. -Okay, bye. Please revise it. I don't like it. Okay? A warning from our client regarding the delay of the Kulon Progo project. This is what I meant by "messed up." Now would you like me to be grateful? Please call me when you can. -Hello. -Pras. What is it? Have you read the letter from Mr. Richard? Okay, please send the reply tomorrow. Tell him that we'll meet the day after tomorrow and I'll explain everything. -Okay. -I want to take today and tomorrow off. -All right then. -Okay. Thanks. -How is Arini? -I want to see Akbar. I moved out. It's not your fault, Mei. If it weren't for me, this wouldn't have happened. It's all because of me. I'm ready to take responsibility. Okay, if you want to spend the night here, I'll prepare a hot bath for you. I don't think I can stay here, Mei. Okay, I understand. Okay. Let me make a cup of tea for you. Rin, this is from your mother. After prayers today, she was thinking of Nadia, so she stopped by my place. It's unlike you to come alone without Pras. Usually, you do everything with him. You want to learn to be independent? How is Rifai? Tell us. I canceled my divorce. He was right after all. It wasn't Rifai, but his friend. Rin, what's wrong? -Bye. -Come on. Peace be with you. Mother! -Dad! -Princess. -I missed you, Princess. -I missed you too. Why do you rarely come home? I want to tell you my new tale. I'm sorry, Princess. Nadia, come on. Dad brought his own car. You have to come home with me. We have to buy books to complete your tale. And you promised your teacher to present the tale onstage. Right. I forgot, Mom. Please come and see my performance, Dad. Yes, sweetie. I will. You two are fighting, aren't you? No, darling. We're not. -I just have a lot of work at the office. -Why are you crying? Nadia, we have to go home. Now. Come, sweetie. In all this time, I have never been so disappointed in you, Mr. Pras. But this time, I really don't understand. This is a fundamental mistake. I can't imagine this being done by someone like you. We are sorry, sir. -I have been having some family issues. -We have been negligent, sir. We accept our fault. For that, we will bear the cost of the increased expenses. It's not about the cost. We have committed to a deadline for the project's completion. -Let's focus on this one. -Yes, I agree. Mr. Pras, we have to postpone other projects until you complete this one. Agreed? Agreed, sir. If the next project is delayed, who is going to pay for the additional costs? You must find a solution. How long has it been since Pras came home? -How did you know? -I can sense there is something wrong. But there is no problem that can't be solved. Religion teaches us to face all problems with patience and sincerity. Are women born just to let their hearts get broken, Mom? I'm not as strong as you. I also don't want you to be like me. But there's one thing you have to think about. Nadia's future. There are lots of kids raised by a single parent who are successful. Oh, God. The Madaniah fairy tale that I created with Pras is ruined. I know that. But that tale isn't over yet. -May I borrow your comb? -Yes. Come on, honey. Don't forget what you have to perform. Mom, why hasn't Dad come yet? Don't worry. Don't wait for your dad. You have me and your grandma here. Could you call Dad, Mom? I want him here. Come on. Please. He promised me. Okay, I'll call him now. Wait here with your grandma. -Hello. -Peace be with you. And peace be with you too. -Where are you? -I'm on my way. God willing, I'll get there in 30 minutes. Okay then. Peace be with you. -Hello. -Akbar has been throwing up. Oh, God. Since when? Since early this morning. -Where is Mbok? -She's not coming today. -What medicine have you given him? -I haven't... I don't know. I haven't given him anything. I'm afraid I might give the wrong one. What should I do? Honey? Hello? Yes. Okay. Just wait. I'm going there now. -He's still throwing up? -Yes. Okay, prepare his things. Let's go to the doctor. Honey. Peace be with you. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the annual performance of Bianglala Kindergarten. -Hello, Arini. -Where are you? -Sorry, I-- -Whose voice is that? Where are you? Why is there a child crying? Akbar is throwing up again. I'm at Meirose's house. Akbar is sick, so I-- -Hurry up! -For the first performance... Be patient, sweetie. He promised. If he can't keep it, then he shouldn't make promises to me and Nadia. Let it go. -I'm sorry. -Ask God for forgiveness. Darling, let's go to the doctor. -Hello. -The vomit, is it watery or thick? Hello? Is the vomit watery or thick? -Watery. -It's watery. -Is his temperature high? -Wait. His temperature? -It's normal. -Does he have loose stools? Yes, three times since this morning. I think he just feels a little unwell. Just rub eucalyptus oil on his body. Okay. But if he still has loose stools and he's vomiting, -take him to the hospital. -Okay. Thanks. If you can't be here, it's okay. I'll explain it to Nadia. MY BELOVED HUSBAND Let's call our representative from the A1 kindergarten class, Nadia Citra Prasetya. Once upon a time, in a kingdom named Madani, lived a king and his kindhearted queen. They have a beautiful daughter named Sabrina. The king and queen love her very much. One day, the king has to leave the palace because there's an enemy threatening the Madani kingdom. Sabrina is sad to be parted from her beloved father. Dad, why are you the one who has to go? You could ask your soldiers. My beloved Sabrina, the soldiers of our kingdom don't have the courage to fight the evil fairy. They are cowards. Don't be sad, Sabrina. Your dad is fighting for us. Let's pray he'll come home safe and sound. Time passes, the king finally comes home and brings something home for Sabrina. Dad, I'm scared. Why did you bring an evil fairy for me? Sabrina, she's not an evil fairy, she is a kind fairy. We're the ones who are evil because we do not care for others. We forget that there are others who also care for us. We're arrogant, and that's why people are cruel to us. We have to care for others so that the Madani kingdom is respected. FAVORITE PERFORMANCE AL-MADANAH KINDERGARTEN Dad. -Why are you awake, Princess? -You're going? I... If you and Mom fight, I won't have a little prince. Nadia. We're not fighting. Nadia, tonight Dad won't go anywhere. He's here to accompany his little princess. Is it true? Yes, sweetie. I'm not going anywhere. Finally, the King is not going. Let's come inside. Okay. Peace be with you. And peace be with you too. Sorry to bother you, Arini. Why are you here? To explain to me why the two of you were in Pras' wedding picture? Rin, we've come here of our own will. And I know you don't like us both right now. But please remember one thing. Pras never meant to hurt you. He didn't. He only wanted to help the woman. So that her life wouldn't be ruined. So that she could have new hopes. So that Akbar's life wouldn't be like his. He only thinks about how to make this world different than his. And for me, it's like a fairy tale. But you and Pras proved to me that fairy tales can make people alive and give them hope. And make people self-confident. I'm your friend. I just don't want your fairy tale to end tragically. So what is the purpose of you coming here exactly? You want me to accept the woman as his second wife? If our fairy tale has to end tragically... Well, that's his choice. But, Arini, God promises a big reward if you're patient and sincere. So that in the afterlife, you could travel the bridge to heaven with ease and speed. So you can go to heaven faster than me and Hartono. The heaven that you describe is so beautiful. But I'm sorry, that is not the heaven I'm longing for. Thank you for being good friends to Pras. You're welcome. -Peace be with you. -Peace be with you too. Pras, always remember, as long as you have God in your heart, you will never suffer. Therefore, keep reading, son. -Peace be with you, Mei. -Peace be with you too. Where are you? At the office. Mei, I want to come to your house. There's something I would like to talk about. Okay. I'll wait. Mother, how did it feel when you knew Father married another woman? Hurt, angry, disappointed. Just like you. What made you bear that? Because of you. You tortured yourself. I don't know what would've happened if I made a different decision. As long as you're healthy and do not lack anything, every hardship feels lighter. I chose to let go and forgive. I did not want you to grow up in the shadow of your parents' hatred. You have to make your own choice, Rini. But whatever your choice is, you'd better discuss it thoroughly with Pras. Okay? Until the end of time, Akbar, you are my prince. And wherever you are, I'll be with you. Run, ma'am! Run! Yes? Hello? Peace be with you too. Who is this? Arini. Arini. Arini. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Honey, how did this happen? -Arini. -It's me. It's Arini. I'm here. You have to be strong. Be strong. You're the only one I have, Akbar. Whatever we do, the point is to be blessed. Blessed people, their hearts will be calm because they are bright. You are asking me to wear this? You look prettier like this. When kneeling down, we surrender everything to God so that we won't be arrogant. Seven points of our body have to touch the ground. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Keep the elbow close. While kneeling... He's my hero, oh, God. He saved me. But he's not mine alone. I forced him to share. If only I knew You better, God, I would never build my happiness over another woman's tears. I don't want to burden anyone. Pras, Arini, and also myself. You determine our fate, God. Keep me safe. Protect me. Protect Pras. Keep him safe. Arini. God Almighty speaks the truth. Thank God. -Arini. -Honey. I'm sorry. -I was naive. -You're not. Selfish. And I hurt your feelings. Nobody is wrong. And there's nothing to forgive. I mean it sincerely. I mean it sincerely. Arini. Can I come in? Please do. -Peace be with you. -And peace be with you too. -Are these your parents? -Yes. My dad left on my 12th birthday. My mom killed herself. Since then, I have lived alone. Well, with my maid. Thank you. I work hard to keep this house. Thanks. Where's your dad now? He's in Jakarta. With his new family. He's paralyzed. So, what's up? Right. I came here because Pras asked you to bring Akbar to the hospital. I shouldn't be there, Arini. I shouldn't be in yours and Pras' life. Whatever has happened has happened, Mei. Now we have to think of how to live our lives going forward. For Akbar. For Nadia. -Going forward? -Yes, going forward. Let's drink. Why are you doing all this? Life is a choice. And this is my choice. Come on, Mei. Let's go to the hospital, and don't forget to bring Akbar. I'll wait here. Okay. And finally Princess Sabrina hugs the evil fairy. And that fairy becomes kind. You're as good as your mom. -Peace be with you. -And peace be with you too. Mei, come in. Mother, this is Meirose. Meirose, this is my mother. -Lastri. -Meirose. This is Lia, Sita, my best friends. -Hi, Sita. -Lia. Pras' best friends. Amran. Sweetie. Nadia. Say hello to Aunt Mei. Aunt Mei, this is Nadia. Kiss her hand, sweetie. Who are you? I'm... From today on, she's my little sister. Here is Baby Akbar. You were wishing to have a little prince, right? Now you have a little brother. Nadia has a little prince. I'll make the puppet later. Here, let me hold Akbar. Akbar, sweet angel. Maybe he's thirsty. Or hot. -Peace be with you. -And peace be with you too. -Where's your hijab? -Please sit. Where's the pin? Hurry. Pras, let's start this. Okay, now it's good. Arini. Are you ready? Tonight is the happiest night of my life. My happiness tonight is almost perfect. First, I'm happy because my second book has been released. Second, I'm glad because I understand once more the meaning of patience and sincerity. People have their own will. But there is no human's will that's capable of beating God's will. Think about it. As humans, can we willingly and sincerely accept God's will, whatever it may be? All the answers are written in my second book. Star Palace. Please get the box that is upstairs. These ones are empty. -All of this? -All of it. The ones we stacked-- -Peace be with you. -And peace be with you too. Mei! Help Mei first. Be careful, Mei. Oh, no! Why did you come in a pedicab? -Yes. -How are you? -Fine. -Come in. Gudeg. Dad's favorite. Let's eat, little prince, so that you'll be strong. Now it's time for the little princess to eat. So that you'll be strong too. Aunt Mei, stay here tonight so I can play with Baby Akbar. How about if only Baby Akbar stays here tonight? I'm going home. Otherwise, who would take care of my house? No. I want to tell you the tale of Princess Sabrina. We're bored with it. You've told that tale too many times. It's different this time. Princess Sabrina befriends a very kindhearted fairy. You'll stay, won't you, Aunt Mei? Okay. Now you sit and eat up. Once we're done, I'll fix up the room for Aunt Mei. But you have to finish your meal. And don't forget to pray. -Let's eat, Mei. -Yes. I don't know whether to feel sad or happy about all this. Happiness and sadness only belong to God and are entrusted to humans. Both have to be appreciated. I don't know how strong I'll be living this fairy tale. In the end, if everybody gets hurt, I'll be the first who chooses to go. Mei. Mei. Mei, let's do our morning prayers together. Mei? Mei! Mei? Mei? Mei? Rini and Pras, I'm sorry I left without saying goodbye. Please take care of Akbar. Love him and take good care of him. I can't give him what he needs right now. But I'm sure, in your hands, he'll stay on God's path. Honey! It's Mei. We have to explain to Mei. Maybe she misunderstood. Mbok! We are leaving now! Please watch Nadia for me. -Is Mei here? -She just left for the train station. She's going to Jakarta. -Mei. -Honey. -Let's go home. -Why are you here? -Don't be reckless. -I'm not the old Meirose anymore. You don't have to leave. Why? -I have to choose and this is my choice. -But Arini... Arini has already accepted this. We both know there's no woman who is completely willing to share everything. We all make sacrifices. Me, you, Arini. Even Nadia and Akbar. I promised to protect you. You once said that a good woman will find a good man. I want to be that woman. Maybe one day, I could be like Arini. But for now, I... Mei. Honey, you have made me strong. So, even if God doesn't send that man to me... My prayer and my sacrifice and my life and my death are for God, the Lord of the worlds. Arini, thank you for everything. Forgive my faults. Please, take care of Akbar. Protect him and love him. I know you will be a good mother to him. -Take care, Mei. -Thanks for everything. Thanks. -Take care. -Okay. Today, I end my tale with sadness to let another woman's tale end happily. Because for me, happiness is when we can make others happy.
