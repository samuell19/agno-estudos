Bouskila, you want a ride? Why not? Thanks a lot. Ben-Lulu, is it possible that I'm dead? Hurry up, we don't want to miss your funeral. Look how many people came, Ben-Lulu. What an honor. Look at her, damn her. Putting on a show. She wants everyone to pity her. What do you expect? Poor thing. She's hurting. She drove me to my grave. Now she's hurting? Never mind. Look at Ben-Simon. We didn't speak for 3 years. Good for him for coming. Let's go, Bouskila. Did you invite her? - No. Bless your soul, everything'll be fine. Where'd you get that dress? - Like it? Congratulations. - Thanks. Let's get going. - Right away. Where's your father? - I don't know. Where's your father? - Dunno. In the back. Stop it, Mom! I invited her. Mom... Levana, she made her choice. Mom. Mom... Don't interfere. She eloped with an Arab, right? This is my party. Have some consideration. Take your flowers and congratulations and get out of my house! We have Elijah's Chair here, a rabbi. Show some respect. Rama, my sister, stop it. Today is a happy occasion. We have to finish before it gets late. We'll finish when I say so, you hear me? Now get out of here and take this garbage with you! What is this? A funeral? Let's go, Mevorach, it's a circumcision ceremony. Blessed art Thou, Lord our God, Who sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us to perform circumcision. Amen! Blessed art Thou, Lord our God, Who brought us to this day. Amen. Did Levana leave? Yes, she had to go. Good work. Won't you stay home tonight? They know your grandson had a circumcision today. Rama. Rama. Leave me alone. Rama. Leave me alone! What do you want? Rama. What do you want from me? What did he do to you? What do you want? So we're having a hard time, so what? Everyone loves him, he has a good heart. What are you talking about? Didn't you see that he went to work? Did you see what beautiful children he gave me? Not one is a criminal. Even Levana, bless her soul, named her son after him. No... no. What? Wait... Please, don't do anything to him. He doesn't deserve it. l'll do whatever you want. He's the only thing l have. Don't take that from me. Oh, that's what you want? Okay, just wait a second. Here, your favorite. All right? Rama? Rama, the newspaper. My dear. Bless your soul. Thank you. Robert, where did you buy that dress you gave me? From Yves St. Laurent. At Vanunu's, where else? Why? Levana, bless her soul... Too bad she had to go. Robert, l'm worried about you. You know, the wall. How long can l pacify it? What if it doesn't listen to me one day? lt gets madder every day. l can't calm it down anymore. l'm afraid something will happen to you, Robert. l don't want to be left alone. Robert? Are you listening, Robert? Drop it. Enough. You give me no pleasure. Stop threatening me with your damn wall. To hell with you and your stupid wall. You act like a primitive! lf not for me you'd still be in that village. What? And Levana left because she was tired of your nonsense and what you did to Marie. Shame on you! Don't mention that name in this house, you hear? Here, Marie! Marie... Don't mention that name in this house... Marie! Marie! Burn in Hell! l told you not to! Move! l'm leaving. Pack my things, l've had it with you! l'm leaving. Are you two at it again? She tried to burn me. She almost broke my nose. Big deal. What are you doing here, anyway? Have you no shame? Doesn't anyone around here have any respect? The other way around, Mordoch. Are you nuts? How can l bring this home? She'll throw me down the stairs. lf you bring this home, Malka won't let you leave the bedroom. -Really... What with the starter? What is "starter"? The starter! Wait. Here. l saw that one. l saw that one... What do you think l am, a video library? Take these two, they're all the same. Give me 50 bucks for the book, the DVD is free. Mordoch... all the best! Forget him, he's not for you. "Medical Center" Marie, you want a ride? No, thanks. Sure? l'll give you a discount. lt's okay, Ben-Lulu, l prefer to walk. Get in. No charge. No charge! keep going, Ben-Lulu. Lady, you want a ride? Go away, Ben-Lulu. You nut. Eventually, you'll get in. l washed your dress. l'll never wear that dress again. l'm scared. When it happens... l want to be buried next to my mother. l want to be next to my mother. Whatever you want, sweetheart. l promise. l want your sister's birth certificate. She's ill. She wants the forms so she can be buried next to her mother. Next to her mother? Why? Why not next to yours? She chose. She wanted to be an Arab. She is your sister! She's not my sister anymore. She made her choices. You're responsible for this mess. Why did she send you? You have destroyed the family. On my dead body, before she's buried in our cemetery. Even if Religious Authorities agree, she won't be buried by my mother. What? Go, go back to your village. Bury her there. You have plenty of room there, don't you? Bury her close to your mother, we'll see what she says. My mother is still alive. May God help you... Shut up! Shut up, you damn dog. Shut up! Who's there? Who's there? Who is it? Rama, it's me. Go away. Rama, open up, l want to talk to you. Go home. Rama, let me in. l need to talk to you. What do you want? First let me in. Over my dead body. Now what do you want? Be a big sister, just for once. Here... This is for you. lt was Mama's. keep it. Mama's? Mama gave you this? When did she give it to you? Or did you take it? lt doesn't matter. lt's yours. keep it. Rama, l need my birth certificate. What birth certificate? You don't have one, don't you get it? You don't exist to us. Why do you have to give me a hard time? Haven't you shamed me enough? Who shamed who? What about you, huh? The way you shamed the family. The way you shamed Mama. You broke her heart. She died because of you! Poor Dad, he was ashamed to go to synagogue. Rama... Rama, please... Rama, that was long ago. Why do you hate me so much? How can you be so cruel? Have you no heart? Rama, l love you. Rama, please. l love you, Rama. Can't you see? l'm your little sister, l need you! Go away. Rama, l need those papers! Rama... Rama, l'm begging you, l need those papers. Enough, enough. Come on. You don't need them. Let's go. Come on... What are you doing, Mom? Where's the box? Disgusting. Just like your father! What box? With the papers! When will all this nonsense stop? On top. Get up and get it. Where is it? Just wait till your father gets home... What do you need those papers for? Believe me, l'll get you a spot next to the rock by the sea. 5 minutes from your mother. Not even. Two minutes. No, one minute. You just have to jump the fence. Let's go home. Let's keep going. l'm not in the mood. Go home. l'm staying here. Don't break down on me. l'm not breaking down. l just need two minutes alone. l need to think. Alone. Please, go. Go... You're the love of my life. Go on. Go. You're coming, right? Go ahead, l'm coming. Promise? Ben-Lulu, give me a ride. Hey, Robert, how are you? Come join us. What a night, eh? Reminds me of my childhood in the Caucasus. What, Dudik? You had a childhood? What's your name? Whatever you like. Marie. Whatever... Marie... Marie... Marie... Marie... Just a second, Ruti. "A woman of valour Sima Bentulila" Take a look at my hand. What? lt's red. Could it be from my watch? Stop it. What are you doing? Does it hurt? - What? Does it burn? What? Does it sting? What are you trying to do? Peel my skin off? Go away, l'll shower by myself. You're no fun. What's up, Dad? What do you want? Nothing. Did you get some girl pregnant? Why do you always have sex on your mind? l wanted to ask you something. Rama, the door. This is the soil your sister is buried in. One thing l know, once your eyes meet hers you can't lose the momentum. Dad, l didn't even talk to her. Then why are you wasting my time? My sister Marie is dead. She's been dead to you for 20 years. The important thing... l'm tired. l'm going to bed. Dad? "Our beloved mother, sister and grandmother - Sima Bentulila" What was that necklace, Mama? Do you see her or not? What else happened that l didn't know about? Like always, you probably said to yourself: No big deal, let Rama take care of everything. She'll deal with it, she's strong, she'll protect the family honor. What about me? Did you ever consider my needs? You never noticed me, Mama. Never asked yourself what l want. Never! You never even noticed me. She was your angel. Her! lt was always her, her... Bravo, Madame Rama. keep blaming everyone but yourself for your problems. What's the matter? Scared? l thought you'd take it lightly after talking to a wall for years. l'm not talking to you. As far as l'm concerned... you can not talk to me as long as you like. lt doesn't matter anymore. You can't fry a fish twice. You poor thing. But l swear... l won't let you be until you bury me inside the cemetery, right where you're standing, next to Mama. Mama won't allow it. Right, Mama? Rama? You want to know where that necklace was from? Mama gave it to me to protect me from your Evil Eye. What do you mean? From my Evil Eye? From my Evil Eye? What do you mean? Marie! Where are you going? What did she mean, Mama? From my Evil Eye? Rama? What's the matter? What? Mind your own business. l'm serious. l'm telling you. We never had a girl like that working here. You know them all. Don't mess with me, Dudik. She was here yesterday, we went in the Purple Room! l wish. From your mouth to God's ear. Are those marks from those spices you eat? Don't bullshit me about spices! Answer me, you bastard! l'll tear your house apart! Goddamn you. Move! Robert, come here. Robert, calm down! Robert! Go home, Robert. Go calm down. Come back when you're sober. Hey! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! l just want to ask you something. Psst... Dad? Did you see her? l've been watching her for an hour. A woman, dressed in red. What woman dressed in red? Ruti, the one l told you about this morning. Didn't you see the other one? - What other one? What's wrong, Dad? Are you all right? l have to go, son. Looking leads to nothing. l know what l'm talking about. Ruti, wait a second. What do you want? Why did you go? - Why did l go? What was that garbage doing in your room? lt isn't garbage. lt's low-life stuff. - What's so low-life about it? ls this whole town low-lifes? People here have a shitty life and it helps them. lt helps them make love. You call that love? - Yeah, why not? People can do what they want in their own homes. Look at Mordoch the cripple and his wife. Things got better since l gave them the Sutra... the lndian book on sex positions. Or Rivka, who stopped having babies every 9 months. You have no idea how helpful it is. How thankful they are. Listen, what do you care? One second. What... That day...? My father? What's the big deal? He needed it, so l gave it to him. - What did you give him? What do you think, Ruti? That your parents don't... You're gross! Robert? Robert? l lost my appetite. Take your father to the doctor, l have to go, l have something important to do. What's the matter with me, Rama? What's the matter with me? What delicious cakes, l missed them so. l can't believe it. Bravo. What do you want from him? Leave him alone. Who? You want to get back at me through him? Shame on you! Through who? My Robert. Once and for all, was there anything between you? Listen to me and listen good, all l want is to be mourned like anyone else. Bless your hands. Sister, was there or wasn't there? You know what? Come closer. A little more, don't be cheap. Good. Until you bury me next to Mama, l won't answer you. And until you answer me, l'm not leaving. As far as l'm concerned... She's always complaining, messing up my room. What do you expect? She's a rabbi's daughter. Anyway, your room is Sodom and Gomorrah. One day l'll leave home and go as far away as l can, like Levana. She shouldn't think l'm going to forgive her. Who do you think you are? Threatening your mother! Don't get mad, Dad. Your mother was beautiful when she worked for us. My father would've traded her for my mother if he could. All she did was annoy me. Why? l don't even know why. Until one night my dad came home drunk, he went into her room and tried to wake her up. She wasn't into it, and as he dragged her out she grabbed a hanger from the floor and shoved it in his face. The hanger got caught in his nose. He looked like a fish on a hook. Now, instead of going into hysterics... He was an asshole, but he was my father. l started to laugh. And the harder he tried to get it out of his nose the harder l laughed. That's the story. She finally ran away. But she was so beautiful when she humiliated him... l think that was the moment l fell in love with her. l think so. And...? Robert? Come in. "Nothing"? What does he mean, "nothing"? ls he blind, that doctor? And what's "psychosomasi" supposed to mean? Psychosomatic. lt's like when a man can't get it up, the problem isn't in his pants, it's in his head. Heaven forbid. ls that next? How do you know these things, anyway? l read articles in women magazines. Robert, what happened? Oh, it's nothing... lt's psychosomatic. Like the woman he sees on the street. What woman? No, no, it's nothing. l just need a little rest. So long. You know what "psychosomatic" means but not "discretion"? What's wrong with you? Come here. Did anyone ever give you flowers? Sure, every Friday. For the Sabbath. Yes. Yes. The day when every Jewish family gets together. Have you forgotten? No, no, no. Stop it. Not for the family's sake, for you. Just for you. l am my family. "Woe to the family whose windows open on the darkness." Oh God, here she goes again. You and your old sayings. Talk normally. Mom? Dad doesn't feel well, we've been looking for you all day. What's wrong? l'm not going anywhere. But the rash spread all over his face, he needs you. He can manage by himself. But what are you doing here? She's dead. That's none of your business! Why is everything always up to me? Where's the green soap? ln the cupboard. Where's the cupboard? - ln the kitchen! Dad? He's grown. Are you all right, Dad? He's a man now, eh? Can l ask you a question? l told you, l won't answer until... No, no. Not that. Not that. What? Why didn't you have any children? Why? l didn't want to leave anything behind. l didn't want them to suffer because of me and my choices. Do you know how it feels to have people shake their heads at you? And force a polite smile? Why raise children in a world that doesn't care about your truth? What would l leave behind, sis? Rama, where are you going? A new generation of grief? Shunned children? You can't go yet, you still don't know. No, thanks. What do you want? l came and l went. You want me to sit here for the rest of my life just to find out? What do you care? lt's not like you have anything to go home to. What would you do if your little girl was humiliated Stay a little longer, sis. and she came home broken? Me? l'd poke out their eyes and give them to her. This is what l'd do. Then why didn't you do that for me? You were just like this when you were little. Honey, do the 60's dance for me. - What? The 60's dance. Please, just once. Just once... - Leave me alone, you nut. Go on, why not? What do you want? Come home. Come on, Rama. Come here. Come here. l'm not leaving till l finish my business here. What business? What's the point of mourning over a pile of sand? Nothing. Come home. l look terrible. Look at me. Where's the green soap? Under the sink, where it always is. Since when do we have a cupboard under the sink? Are you blind besides everything else? Go away, you annoy me. Go! Forgive me, sis. You're my world, my love... Who do you think you are, yelling at me? Come home before l tear your house apart. Forgive me... Go ahead! As far as l'm concerned... l'm not moving. Forgive me, forgive me... Come here a second. Tell kobi to scrub your back and leave a little before he rinses you off. Crybaby. Forgive me, forgive me, my love... l can't believe it's you. Where were you? Where did you disappear to? l missed you. So many things l wanted to tell you and do with you. You still not want to know if anything happened between me and Robert? Do you think it's safe? Yes? Let's get out of here. He's a respectable man, people love him. Yeah, sure, at that Georgian's bar, what's his name... What are you doing? lf it isn't you, then who cursed him? How should l know? Did you ask him? l'm dancing. The sky is falling and you're dancing? You don't ask a man what he does. How do you know how to dance, anyway? ln your case you're right. lt's better not to ask questions. You won't like the answers. She didn't even give you the time of day. What did you see in that Arab? lt's all your fault. You seduced me. You bewitched me. You made me your captive. Well? Well? You know what? What are you doing? Fine, it's my fault. You're so disgusting! But what about you, Robert? Let's see you be a man. Oh, how l love him. Take her out of her grave and put her in a Jewish grave, like she wanted. Go ahead. He always accepted me just as l am. You do it! He's the only one who truly saw me, You ruined it, so you fix it. loved me, You. l won't lift a finger for you. all of me. But to renounce your parents for him? Not a finger, you hear me?! Poor thing. l never renounced you, you renounced me. You threw her out, you embarrassed her. How could your father show his face in the synagogue? You made sure she wouldn't come in the house Stop it. We both know that that's not why you renounced me. and threaten you with her beauty. lt was because of Robert. So she wouldn't have feelings towards me... This is ridiculous. l honored Mama and Papa's wishes. And l do know how to dance. Right, Marie? Where are you going? l can dance, isn't that right? Marie, where are you going? Did something happen between you? Are you going to be an idiot all your life? How blind can you be? When will you realize that your troubles with Robert are your fault! Rama? Rama? When will you learn to respect yourself? Rama, wait. How can people love you if you can't love yourself? Rama, please... Rama, l didn't mean it. l didn't mean it. The saddest part is, you'll never understand why l chose Ali. So you don't like the cookies, eh? Always the same thing. You're so beautiful. You've lost your desire, eh? You're so beautiful. l understand, believe me. May l? Every day the same tears, the same wishes. You get sick of it, eh? You go crazy. Wait... Wait, l'll get you something. Here... Come here. Go like this. Here... You asked why l chose Ali? Eat. Have a drink. That's who l am. Me too... That's what l wanted, l'm not going anywhere until you eat. that's how l lived, Eh? and that's how l felt. Rama's cookies are better, eh? That's right. Rama? So what if he's an Arab? Rama? Wait a second. Rama! Why, what are we? Aren't Moroccans a kind of Arab? Rama! Arabs... Look, l can dance, Rama. Do we eat what they eat? Have short tempers like them? Look, l can dance. Pray like them? Talk like them? Why won't you look at me? Never. What are we, Arabs? Why won't you talk to me? Why are you running away? What do you want from me? What did l do to you? Wait, what did l do to you? Rama! Rama! Okay, you need help. No, your father needs help. Not that kind. Treatment. - Treatment? Treatment? What for? l'm fine, can't you see? Treatment, Mom. A psychologist. What for? lt's just like talking to your wall. Rama? But the psychologist can answer, it's human, it's normal. Didi and l went when l was pregnant and it helped. Rama. l'll take you to someone in Tel Aviv, no one here will know. Why do you think l need your stupid Tel Aviv? Why? Just look at you. Rama... You sit here covered with paint in the middle of a cemetery while Dad is sick. Does that make sense? What are you thinking? You're waiting for her to come back out? To apologize? lt's too late. She's gone. You have to be strong, Dad isn't well. You have to take care of him. Who do you think you are? Coming here in that truck of yours, with your fancy psychologists, schmychologists. What makes your psychologist better than my wall? lf your father is so important, you take care of him. l can't take care of him now. l have an important project. Rama. Rama. Go do your projects if it's so important. Get up... Get up, Rama. Get up... You don't want to miss anything, God forbid. You have to go home... - l can't... -Get up... But don't judge us. Stay out of our lives, you hear? She comes by every two months to ease her conscience, Get up... every Friday for an hour or two, and she's dying to leave. You have to go home. With her little plastic boxes... and her phone. Text messages. Here. Take this. Who are you talking to? You. You! Go home. You left your own son's circumcision. - Because of you! She's right about that. - Shut up. Stay out of it. Look at her. First thing, she attacks. No hug, no kiss, no "how are you, Mom?", nothing. Yes... Ruti? Good for you, sis. Don't let anyone push you around. Come here a second, Ruti. Did something happen between you? - Shut up. Ruti. l love you. Ruti... Ruti... What? What, "what"? Prove it to me... Nothing. Come here, l'll prove it. Fine. l'm going to the mall to eat. Can l get you anything? No. Hello, Mrs. Bentulila. Hello. l know we never got along. You have every reason, l did a lot of stupid things. But let's put that aside, okay? l have something important to tell you. Not about me. l'm not asking anything for myself, besides, you wouldn't give it to me anyway. l'm here for your daughter's sake. No, not the pretty one. The other one, the one who sleeps in bed with me. Look what's happening to her. l'm worried. Couldn't you just give her a little love? l'll tell you the truth, l don't know whether l love her. Sometimes you look all over for something that's right there. Come to think of it, l've never caressed her. You know, a real man can't degrade a woman. Only a degraded man can degrade a woman. What did she ask, the poor woman? Just to love me. And me? What did l give her back? Shame and humiliation. Ben-Lulu? Ben-Lulu, for God's sake, take me home. l can't, Robert, l'm in a hurry. - But l'm tired, Ben-Lulu. Robert, you don't look so tired. You can walk. There's your son, Robert. He'll take you home. kobi! kobi? Come here, you loser. Where to? l don't know, just driving. Just driving? All right. Take care of yourself, eh? Good luck. You too. Where have you been hiding that ass? Eh? Forgive me. Your hair is all white. What about yours? And whose fault is that? Mine. Obviously. lt better not be anyone else's fault. Now we're even. We're even. - Yes. Go take a shower. You look terrible. Come with me. l haven't finished the wall yet. Leave the poor wall alone. Give it a rest. Leave it as it is, as a memorial to the destruction of this house. Robert, it's time. "Regional Cemetery" Subtitles: Cinematyp Ltd.
