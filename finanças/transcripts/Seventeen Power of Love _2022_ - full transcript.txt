SEVENTEEN! SEVENTEEN! SEVENTEEN! How I dreamt of becoming a singer... When I was little, it wasn't my dream to be a singer. I thought it couldn't come true. Like, "This isn't my dream" I denied it… I wasn't set on becoming a singer or celebrity. It was just a vague thought. Should I say it feels a bit like fate? Now that I think about it. I loved listening to songs and music since I was a kid. It's not that I wanted to make it my profession. I just liked music. I liked dancing. I liked to dance, and that's when I saw Michael Jackson. He was so shockingly cool. So I thought, "I want to be a singer." The first time I was cast for an audition was when I was 15. After that, I started as a trainee… I think I learned to dance right away. When I actually got into the field, I realized that it was really competitive. I thought it was really cool how the trainees practiced so hard. Since then, I dreamt of becoming a singer. We trained hard and debuted together. We got on stage that time, and I saw that getting cheered by the people and receiving attention was a blissful job. That's how we didn't give up and worked really hard until our debut. First, I think this show will be a concert that can show various aspects of love. So that's why we named our concert "POWER OF LOVE." We tried to express love a bit more in the "LOVE" version. So our facial expressions are a bit more colorful, and it's a version that contains the message we wanted to send to the CARATs very well. The first thing that comes to mind is being on stage and wanting to perform more. It's been a difficult time, so we are more eager for it. Because we hadn't been able to see the CARATs for a long time, I felt that the strength we were holding onto diminished little by little. And I thought the CARATs would certainly feel the same way. So we wanted to share stories about the power of love even more. [Seventeen Power of Love: The Movie] The POWER OF LOVE Concert was held online. So because of it, we weren't able to connect and share emotions in person, and it might have been difficult, and you might not have felt the connection. But I truly believe love made it all possible. When we did the "LOVE" version, I tried my best to share my love for the CARATs. Having the audience there feels very different from not having them there. The sharing of this invisible energy is notably different. For example, we can read the members' vibes quicker when it's an online concert. We feel more pressure to do well. Our choreography and our live singing all have to go perfectly. "The camera is recording me, so I must look into it." "Are we lined up properly?" Because we were able to pre-record some parts, we were able to show many different sides of us. But when we were on the stage and heard, "5 minutes left, 3 minutes left," I got nervous. The cameras really felt like our fans' eyes, and once we got up on the stage, I got nervous. [The Beginning] I remember the moment of our debut- the moment when our debut was confirmed. [Debut] For me, it's the debut project. It was a life-changing start for me. One, two, three, fighting! We needed 1000 audience members to watch our performance on stage to receive the rings and pass the mission to debut. But somehow, I thought it was not going to happen. We gathered for the announcement, but right before that, our parents appeared behind us. I rarely cry, but I think I cried on that day. I think that was our first step. And at that time, I think there was nothing but ambition in our hearts. It's Seventeen's "Pretty U!" [First Win] They made the announcement, and our song played. That was a shocking moment. It was really shocking in a good way, and I cried a lot. Even WOOZI, who never cries, cried on other members' shoulders. I still remember that moment. It didn't really hit me at first. All the hardships we went through flashed back inside of my head. Because it felt like we were being rewarded for it, so it's etched in my memory. At that time, we were happy together but also crying together, so it'll stay in my memory for a long time. We're so grateful to the CARATs. CARATs, we'll always make you happy. Thank you! Hello, CARATs! It's S.COUPS. It would've been better if I could say this in person, but through this amazing opportunity, I hope you'll be happy when you see us in the theater today. Thank you, and I love you. Love? I think it's too difficult to come up with just one thing right now. For me, it's very pinkish... Loveliness? The shape of a heart came to my mind. I always feel the power of love in my everyday life. We want to express our love. There's sadness in love, and there's happiness as well. And I wanted to share how I felt about that with you. When the CARATs sang along together at the concerts I think I felt the love the most. We received so much love from the CARATs that I want to continue to express my gratitude. I think SEVENTEEN felt that the power of love is huge. Since the CARATs can't see the show in person, I think we named the concert like that in the sense that we want to see the CARATs in person as soon as possible. Unfortunately, Myung Ho and I couldn't participate in this concert. We didn't have enough time to practice when we were in China. So we shot our part, and it was played on the LED screen at the back. VERNON and JOSHUA were dancing in front of the screen. I guess it's a new experience performing like this. I saw JUN in a very long time, thanks to "Network Love." "We can connect wherever we are as long as there is love." It also went well with the song's theme, so I remember having a lot of fun doing it. I am always wanting to repay the love... I received from the fans. [PERFORMANCE] Since our unit is the Performance unit, music, rap, dance, and acting, they're all performances. We keep on finding and trying new things. Something more visual... Something tougher? We dance a little more than the Vocal and Hip Hop teams. Also, since it's four of us, not 13, there's more attention to detail because it's easier to see the formation. HOSHI's like, "I'll do this, so please keep up with me." He doesn't force it at all. I wouldn't have followed if I didn't like HOSHI, but I do like him. Sincerity, honesty. That is his leadership. It's been a difficult time, so we want it more. We're more eager about it, and we want to perform more. We want to show the CARATs something better, so "What might they like even more?" That's what I always have in mind. [HIP HOP] What makes SEVENTEEN Hip Hop Team special? Did the other Hip Hop Team members give this answer? Hip Hop Team goes with the flow like water. I think it's the most free and smooth team. So when Hip Hop Team works on a song, we decide on the topic, then scatter because we need to each write our own lyrics. When we get together, the topics go awry sometimes. WONWOO is quick in writing lyrics. He can just write the lyrics without getting stuck. And he doesn't care what others think. In VERNON's case, if there's a line that he wrote, he keeps singing it out loud and writes the next line. Then he reads those two lines out loud before writing the third line. So he takes his time. I try to take an interest in what's happening in the world. I should deepen my understanding of the world I live in in order to broaden my creative world. I'd say I make more unconventional songs than other songs in my team. I have no idea where MINGYU writes his lyrics. He just brings them at some point. MINGYU and I are the same in that we care a lot about what others think. So we revise our lyrics often. So MINGYU and I also seem to take the longest time to write. First of all, about "Bittersweet..." It was really hard to make. We had hoped the song would be sexy and also cool. We made a song about "between love and friendship." We wanted to upgrade SEVENTEEN's maturity a bit. And MINGYU and I could show a more mature side. So that's how we came to write the song "Bittersweet." Those are the moments that really stuck with me. I talked a lot with our members. I still remember writing lyrics until 5 AM or 6 AM. "IF I" is the first sentimental song that we tried out. It's a song that could show a new side of us at that time. "IF I" is… The lyrics I wrote were very fantasy-like. But then suddenly, he said, "No, it has to be a song about a breakup." You can ask Coups yourself about it. Really? Did I do that? I think we had different topics in mind. MINGYU wrote about dreams, I think? That's what I remember. After a long discussion and much convincing, we changed the topic entirely. I think he was talking about how he had to rewrite the lyrics from scratch because of it. After the song's complete and we perform it live, we forget the old lyrics, and they kind of make you cringe. The changed lyrics are now the best lyrics for the song. Coups is coming later. Is he doing the interview here? Yes. [VOCAL] The Vocal Unit is ♪♪♪. I think all the weird guys on our team are in the Vocal Team. There's not a moment that's boring. Even when we joke around, we joke around very creatively. JOSHUA and JEONGHAN really listen to the younger members well. WOOZI works very hard on the songs for us. I think WOOZI will kind of feel this way too. I don't think there's anything like "I'm the leader!" Everyone's just the same. We're all on the same level. We all say, "Our Vocal Team leader is awesome," or "Our leader's the best!" There's also a nickname for him, "Vobo," shortened from "Vocal team's Boss." I think they said that because I'm not trying to lead. I've never really thought that I act like a leader. What's funny is that we're all quiet when we're alone. But if the five of us come together, it's always the Vocal Team if something funny and weird is going on in SEVENTEEN. We're the team where the members' bright energy stands out the most. It was our unit song this year, "Same Dream, Same Night, Same Mind." "Same Dream, Same Mind?" Right, it's "Dream, Mind, Night." My bad. But this is all WOOZI's fault. Wooahae. "How about we make a song in a genre that we like and grew up listening to?" I suggested that to the members. We self-produce and give our own opinions on the music and choreography. A song that can resonate... SEVENTEEN is always by your side, even during these hard times, and hoping the CARATs are happy, at least while watching this. I think that's what love is. - DK? - Yes. What do the CARATs mean to you? CARATs are me, and I am the CARAT. - Thanks to CARATs! - I'm so happy every day! CARATs, let's sing together! Let's sing from the first verse again! I love you! [Making of "Snap Shoot"] The making of "Snap Shoot?" To put it short, it was the toughest thing I did. Honestly, it was really hard. I know how hard our crew works here right now, filming all 13 of us. I felt very thankful to the staff again. Because members are close to each other and I know them very well, I know what they'd like and what they'd not like. If I didn't know that well, we might've ended up fighting. - I don't think it's recording, Mingyu. - Really? - What? There's not much time left. - 5 minutes and 26 seconds? - Is this what I think it is? - Let's go, let's go. - The flower called you has bloomed! - Oh, no! We're all going to die! Looking at the flower called you! We're Kkanbu! Oh, wow... Boo Seungkwan! Boo Seungkwan! Boo Seungkwan! Go DINO! Go DINO! Go DINO! Go DK! Go DK! Go DK! [Brothers, Family, and SEVENTEEN] There are so many memorable moments that I don't know which one to pick. Hanging out with the members last night was already memorable. There was a time we had so much fun at the hotel pool. It was my first time having that kind of experience, and I had so much fun with the members, so that was one of the most memorable moments. Fix the camera below, shoot the legs from the bottom, and come down like this. To me, my members are like real brothers. It's just so much fun when we're all together because we are all close. But when I come back to my room, it comes to mind. "Was what I said a bit too harsh?" or "Was that joke too much?" Or "Should I have said something like this more?" I was surprised to find myself thinking that. "That's how much I care about the members." They're precious to me, like a real family. It's like we believe in each others' sincerity. Simply put, shall I say we got more attached? We talk about and listen to each others' hardships, and encourage and support each other. It feels great that we positively impact one another. Whether it's funny or not, my members will always laugh at my jokes. They boost my confidence, so I can be funny and just be myself. I came to Seoul when I was really young, and I don't have any siblings. We're not exaggerating or trying to prove something when we say we're family. It just feels like we are a real family. Oh, today is the last show. - JEONGHAN. - Yes? What can we do when we miss the CARATs? Seven years... Seven years is definitely not a short time. Should I say we built up this team well together? This is so... Those seven years have been so precious. The passionate cheers of the audience shouting at me and the eyes of everyone only looking at me. "Being loved is truly a great thing." That's what I thought a lot. Seven years is a long time. But I feel like it went by in a blink of an eye. I gained a lot of energy at the in-person concerts. So every time we went on the stage, I thought it would be great if we could perform in front of the CARATs as soon as possible. SEVENTEEN! SEVENTEEN! SEVENTEEN! The most memorable moment... That's a hard question. What comes to my mind right now is the opening for our Japan concert. Memorable tour? The first thing that comes to mind is the ODE TO YOU tour. It was the last in-person tour. That was the first time I felt "CARATs are supporting us from all across the globe." That feeling and how they look at us, their gaze, are really etched in my memory. When our fans stood in front of us with their glowing light sticks and looked at us with loving eyes, I think that was the most memorable. My legs almost gave out then. When the show's about to start, I take my in-ears off because I want to start by listening to the cheers. But that time, I got so scared and nervous that my legs got weak, and I got goosebumps, so I put my in-ears back on. That moment when the cheers from many CARATs surrounded me was so electrifying, and I cannot forget it. [MC MINGYU] It was the biggest venue we had ever held until that time. When I opened my eyes, the lighting was blue, so it looked like a cosmic universe of blue light was out there. I had my in-ear monitors on. And normally, the outside sounds don't come through the in-ears. But that day, I could hear the roars reverberating through my body. It was very electrifying, and I thought, "I'd be so happy even if this is the end of my life." That's how happy I was. Hello, I'm HOSHI, the CARATs' prince! This is HOSHI! I can remember the expressions on the CARATs' faces and everyone being so happy and excited. Our fans are dancing together and enjoying the concert. And in some regions, they just look at us endearingly. And when I hear, "Whatever you do, we'll be by your side and support you," the fact that they say that gave me so much strength. SEVENTEEN exists because there are CARATs. Now, I'd be sad if you weren't there. SEVENTEEN! SEVENTEEN! SEVENTEEN! During our world tours, we meet many different CARATs in each city. The cities are different, but the CARATs don't change. How we and the CARATs feel, and their love for us... I think that love could also be our power. I just keep thinking about that moment. I remember the light sticks and the CARATs having fun. Each and every CARAT holding the light stick... That love means so much to us. The CARATs look at us and cheer for us, and we look back at them. Words can't describe the interactions that take place there. I just go blank and then realize the song has ended. Thank you so much for always making us happy. Thank you. Actually, it felt surreal. "I've become this kind of person," "I'm someone that can receive love from this many people," and "I've become a special person that can give strength to many people." That's how I felt. Reading messages and letters from fans also gave me a lot of strength. The CARATs say they can go on each day with love for us, thinking about us. They send us a lot of warm words and are like friends. They're like family too. That's how I'd describe them. Actually, when I woke up this morning, I wasn't really feeling well. But since the CARATs have been waiting for us for a long time, I came here thinking that I should share a lot of energy and power until the end. We only live once, and thank you so much for letting me live showered with love. I lost my voice on the last day of the tour. I don't like to show that I'm not feeling well. So I danced and sang as hard as I could so that nobody would notice. Someone once told me, "I found the strength to live thanks to your music." But as time went by, I learned that it works the other way around, too, that I felt that way from the CARATs. As I saw myself becoming a person who is gaining strength to live from all of you, the CARATs are the ones that keep me alive. We had a really hard time back then. We had a lot on our schedule, and all the members felt very tense. I was feeling skeptical if I was being happy and enjoying the work. But when I saw the CARATs waiting near the concert venue, I thought, "Can I wait for someone in that cold just to see them in person if I were them?" I don't think I could've done it. That's when I realized I was receiving so much love. That was the turning point of my life, even to this day. It was when we couldn't meet our fans because of Covid. I went out for a walk and ran into a fan. She tried to prove that she's a fan with photo cards and stuff in her bag. At that moment, I thought, I'm so blessed to have this job. I was so happy. That was the day I could really feel the power of love. To me, the CARATs are... the ones that allow me to keep growing. [The ones who help me grow] There's something I always say to the CARATs. There's no SEVENTEEN if there're no CARATs. [The reason for my existence] The performances that we do are all for the CARATs. So I'll say they are the reason for my life. [The reason for my life] I wanted to convey that "we trust each other, and the trust is big." To me, the CARATs are the ones I could trust even during a war. [Someone I can trust during a war] I want to show you a better me. I hope we can see each other soon. [My thankful existence] I wanted to say, "If there are no CARATs, there is no SEVENTEEN." I want to be together forever. [Forever] We have CARATs that brighten our days, even during dark times. [My Rainbow] In the process of my growth, CARATs grow, too, so they are the ones that walk together. [My Light] The word "fan" is not enough. They're also like friends to me. Whether I'm lonely or not, they are the ones who are always by my side. [My Everything] They're the ones who made me who I am today. [The one who made me who I am now] The CARATs tell me that I'm a great person. [My driving force!] They're the ones that made me born again. The CARATs are so precious to me that they make me think about what they might like and makes me wonder how I can make them happy. They are the ones that keep making me think. [The one who gives happiness] Every one of them is a part of SEVENTEEN. I always think of them as one of our members. [Member number Zero] Put your hands up! Put your hands up! Put your hands up! Put your hands up! Turn up! Our youngest! - CARATs, thank you! - Thank you! - I don't want to go home! - I miss you! We are SEVENTEEN. Say the name! SEVENTEEN! Thank you! WOOZI, why aren't you singing? Put your hands up! CARATs, let's meet in person next time! Thank you for always staying by our side even when you can't see us in person, and thank you for coming to see us today. - Thank you! - Thank you! We are SEVENTEEN. Say the name! SEVENTEEN! Thank you! - I love you! - CARATs, thank you! - This is the last time online! - See you next time! - I love you! - I miss you so much! I miss you all so much! - Last online concert! - See you next time! I love you! Wonranghae! Encore! Encore! Encore! It's hard to put into words. If we meet each other again in person at a concert, of course, I would... I think I'd cry. I think I'd ask, "You missed us a lot, right?" Honestly, I think I'd be crying. But with jokes aside, I'll say, "I missed you." And I'm sure the CARATs feel the same way. I think the CARATs will be able to feel it just by seeing me standing on the stage- Those overflowing emotions. I think I want to say thank you the most. I feel like the words "Thank you" are always not enough. But the only words that can express how I feel now are "Thank you." So I want to say thank you. I want to tell you all that you're so precious to us. I hope we can all have fun at the concerts in person soon. It was hard for us, but it must've been harder for you, and thank you so much for waiting for us until the end, even when you couldn't see us. Now we'll make you even happier. That's what I want to tell them. If one day we hold a concert where cheering is allowed again, I don't think I'll be able to hold back my emotions. What should I say? There are so many things I wanted to say. But I think I'll go speechless if I see that scene. I just want to say thank you so much. Thank you. "I'm happy we're all back together, healthy and well." That's the first thing I'll say to them. The CARATs' lives are already beautiful as they are. And I want to make them even more beautiful. So I hope we can walk forward together. I'm happy because you exist. And I hope I can make you happy, at least a little bit. I hope you stay healthy and not get sick. Let's be happy together. Instead of saying, "CARATs, it's been a while. I'm happy to see you," I want to show our performance soon. I just want to shout. I missed you! [With CARAT] - I want to sing one more song. - Okay. What should we sing? When HOSHI shouts "Exhilarating," blast out the song, please. ♪ Exhilarating! ♪ One, two, three, let's go! One, two, three, four! - Let's just do this! - Just do this! Let me introduce our dance team, who shined on stage with us today. Dancers, please come out! Round of applause for them, please! So cool! Everyone! Let's go! [Special thanks to the CARAT]
