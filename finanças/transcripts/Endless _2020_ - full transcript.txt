Okay, senior year in Clear Lake, California was a blur. I graduated second in our class, did an internship with the DA, and applied to my parents alma mater, Georgetown University. But most importantly, I started going out with Chris. We totally didn't make sense on paper. I was this girl who liked to sit on the dock and draw, and make my own graphic novels. He wash this old school guy who barely graduated, and spent all of his time working on his motorcycle. I was completely, totally, utterly hooked. I could be myself around Chris. He saw me for me. Give Ry a hug for me. Yeah. Love you. We pretended that summer would last forever, like the future didn't even exist. Maybe it was easier that way. After all, we were in love. What are you thinking about? How incredible this place is. You're distracting me. No, it's good. Only good? Well, I mean, no it's great. Only great? I like the humps. You make good humps. Thanks, baby. It's amazing. Only amazing? You look perfect. Did you open it? Well? I got accepted for next semester. Oh my God! Yep. Time to celebrate. Actually, I'm going to Julia's party with Chris. Yeah, but not on a bike, right? Not the motorcycle? No no, I made that very very clear. Why don't you guys spend the night with us? We could order takeout, celebrate the big news together. Yeah, maybe next time I get in college. Oh, you're funny. She got in. You look good. Only good? Great. Perfect. Everything okay? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, let's go. Okay. So they still want me dead, huh? Yeah. Just a little dead. This is amazing. Thanks. Come on, come here. Everybody. Cut the music for a second. Thank you all so much for coming out tonight. It means everything to have the support of close friends. I have an announcement to make. You all know Riley. Woo woo! Well, she decided that she's too smart, and too cool, and generally baller to go to regular old state, like most of us. So, she just got brilliant news. She'll be heading East to Georgetown as soon as her internship with the District Attorney's done, which will be in? Five weeks. Five weeks. But I thought you wanted this. I thought you wanted to stay together. We can do the long distance thing. Babe, it can work for us. Come on, we're different. So, Riley the lawyer, huh? Yeah. Yeah, that's the plan. What? Because it sounds like you don't want me to have a career. What? No that's not. I want you to be you. How am I not being me? You're creative, Ry. I'm going into law, Chris. Come on, it's already been decided. Drawing is something I do for fun, but I'm not an artist. Yeah. I need another drink. Chris? What happened to him? Get off. Oh, okay. Hey Nate, can I use your car? Two shots, two hours ago. I'm fine. Thanks. No glove, no love. This isn't you Ry, it's your parents. I got it. Don't. Let me do it, let me do it. Just stop. You know I love you, Ry. You know that right? I love you so much. You okay? No! Hey, sweetheart. Hey, Ry. How you feeling? What happened? You were in an accident. You spent the night at the hospital. You were in and out of consciousness. You don't remember? No. You had a concussion from the airbag. But the MRI came back fine. The doctor said you'd probably be groggy for a couple of days but, you're gonna make a full recovery. Where's Chris? Right here. Ry? Daddy? They tried. Where's Chris? Why are you lying to her? Ry, I'm right here, I'm. Ry? No. - Hey! - Riley. Someone look at me. Someone look at me, I'm right here! I want to see him. Let me go! Hey. Hey! Someone look at me. Someone look at me. Let go of me. I'm right here! I'm right here! I'm not dead. I'm not dead. You okay? Let me go. Please let me go. I want to see him. No! No. Where is he? Lee's with him. Mom? No. - No. No! - Mom, Mom. No! Mom, Mom, Mom. Get off her! Mom! Mom! Mom! Sorry. Hey. Hey, hey. Do you know where 1025 Blount Street is? I'm late. Where is it? Tell me right now. Come on. Hey. Tell me! Tell me now! It's two blocks that way, all right. It's another half mile, now go. Get your hairy ass up out of here, bro. He asks the same damn thing everyday. He's a no-brainer. He don't know he dead. You know you dead, right? Yeah. What was it? What was it that killed you? Car, car crash. Classic. I love it, yeah. Well, I'm Jordan. Chris. - Oh, just Chris. - Chris. All right. Well, I catch you on the flip, just Chris. Hey wait. Where you going? I got a lot of important meetings with a lot of important people to talk about a lot of important things. I'm just playing, fool. Nowhere, we dead remember? How long ago did you- - October 3, '87. Yeah fools broke up into my auntie house. They was like give me your stuff, fool. Break your stuff. And I was like head up, hand up. You know, but they got a shot off on me. I was 17, but it's all good. 30 years ago, you know. See how old you was when you died is how old you stay when you come here. So what it really means is you ain't got to worry about arthritis or losing your hair, or anything else really. You know, you ain't gonna get hungry, thirsty, sleepy, horny, you're just gonna be. All right so, why are we here? Shouldn't I like know everything now? Do you know everything? No. Let's bounce, man. Now you got a good little spot up here, Chris. Well, so you're not from Philly? Nah, Oaktown you know, but wandering around there got old after like the first five, six years. So I was like, why not go somewhere else, you know? You like that? There's no like or not like when you're in this place man. Those words don't mean anything. You'll come around. You left somebody behind, huh? You got that look in your eye. Look, I know it hurts now man. Trust me I do but, as soon as you stop giving a damn, sooner it all gets better. You'll change your mind, you will. Oh you got it all figured out, huh? And what you're still walking for? So there's a perk or two. See what I don't get is why they can't just like throw it on the pan for a few minutes. 'Cause that's not how the Japanese do it. That's how I do it. Three dollars for this, seriously? Just try it please, for me. No, it's good. Okay, I disagree clearly. All right. Oh God. Oh God, oh. I gotta go. Check please. Morning Riley. You feeling better? Riley this is detective- - Detective Jenkins with traffic homicide investigation. This is just protocol, they send someone from THI in whenever, whenever there's a death involved. Do you mind? Go ahead. Now Riley, I can appreciate that this is hard on you and your family, but do you mind if I ask you a few questions? So Riley Jean Stanheight, date of birth September 6, 1999. Is that all correct? You know that car shouldn't have been on the road. Were you aware that the passenger side airbag was non-functional at the time of the collision? Had you been drinking? Were you distracted? Anything involved that may have impaired your judgment on the road? No. Are you sure about that? I think the answer was quite clear there detective- - Is there anything else? Anything at all that you'd like to tell me, Ms. Stanheight? I think we've had just about enough stress for the day. The brake lights. Riley. The driver in front of us, they stopped short. But there weren't any brake lights. Okay. Thank you. Yeah, and then he hit us with another essay about human sensuality in 1920's Parisian fashion. I think the man's just not getting any sex. You could do everyone a favor and offer your services. You guys don't have to stay. We're not going anywhere. I tried texting Chris last night. Pretty crazy right? No. The worst part is is that I waited for him to text me back. You want to hear crazy? The other night I played both halves of our Fortnite game, switching screens like a maniac. We never could get you two off of that thing. Remember that time at the rink when he forgot his skates, and he played goalie in his converse? They still couldn't score on him. In sophomore year he had this hat. He loved this hat, he wore it all year. What? Hey. What is it? These memories, they're Chris. Okay? Right, and and, and they're all that I have left. And they're gonna fade, and I'm gonna forget, and then Chris is gonna be gone, and then I. I can't live like that, I can't live like that. Okay okay, okay okay okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. You sure you don't want us to stay? Yeah. Bye. Ry, I wish you could hear me. You're gonna get through this, all right. I know you will. Like I told you, she's not ready. And I don't appreciate another house call. No I understand, Mr. Stanheight. Your daughter's recovery comes first. I'm only here to return this. That's mine. The records are showing that you were texting around the time of the accident. - I. - Quiet. Thank you. We'll be in touch. Listen Riley, sweetheart, we gotta seriously think about getting your statement together. That guy's not going anywhere. It's gonna be okay. Let's just go through it all as you recall it, what you were doing, what Chris was doing. Chris wasn't doing anything. I was driving, it was my fault. Well, just consider everything again. Make sure it's clear in your mind, and then we- - Why are you talking like that? Like what? Like how people are going to see me after this, or how it affects me. Of course we are concerned about how it affects you. You're our daughter. And what's Chris, just another thing to consider? Look I can't be late for work. Funerals are expensive. And his father still won't return my call so I'll do everything alone. I'm sure we could help with that. Lee, I was the one who was driving. It was my fault. I just lost the love of my life, and Lee I'm so sorry. Is that what you needed, getting that off your chest? I, I don't know Ms. Duncan. You think that I was sitting here, waiting for you to stop by and say sorry for killing your son? You think that's what I needed? No, that's what you needed. Rich kid, who thinks all it takes to make everything right is, is cash, and some stupid freaking words. Don't show your face here again. Who knew I was so popular? Looks like my father had better things to do. Chris let me show you something. Trust me, think of your favorite place in the whole world right now. Do it. Not my sport, but I respect it. This is incredible. Best seat in the house. So what happened? Oh, rookie mistake. You probably started thinking about something else. Yeah, you gotta watch them stray feelings, boy. Or who knows where you'll end up. Your mind can just randomly take you places whenever it feels like? I mean your mind, sure. But I mastered this teleportation stuff years ago. Dirty ass place. Where we at, bro? This was a mistake. What? Hey? Hey, hold up. You look good, baby. Only good? I don't know why I'm so surprised. I hear your voice every day, everywhere I go. I'm sorry that I'm so weak but, pretending that you're not gone feels really great. Only great? Amazing. Perfect. Chris? Chris? Chris? Dude, I am telling you. I'm telling you she could hear me. I've been here 30 years, bro, 30 long years. And I ain't never heard of nothing like this. The one absolute rule of being dead is we can't communicate- - With the living. You're wrong though. I'm wrong? Oh, you got it all figured out. Okay, prove it. I know Nate better than anyone, all right trust me. Your boy looks like hell. Yeah he does. Well, we doing this or what? Sorry. Damn. Nate. Nate, it's Chris. Nate! Nate? Why would I lie? Oh my God, you tell me. I don't know you. Okay listen, for the sake of argument, let's say you was being straight up with me, that you talked to her- - Which I did. Which you did, yeah. Look, maybe it's some, I don't know, special power you have. And maybe you're supposed to use it to do something. Right, well like what? Look there's only one thing anybody's ever trying to do here, move on. Like I said, most folks skip. Why didn't you skip? What if it only works with your girl, you dig? Like, what if it's just some connection only y'all had? You know we don't have to do this if you don't want to. No, I want to. How's Nate? Texting me awkward stuff in the middle of the night, skipping out on stuff, getting mad for no reason. It's super weird. Hey. Have you ever experienced something that like you couldn't explain? Like, I don't know like you heard something, and then you were like, I heard something. And then you look around and nothing's there. You're hearing things? No. No. Never mind. Okay. Sushi tomorrow night? Me, you, and Nate if I can get him? Yeah, I can dig it? What? Nothing, I've just never heard you say that before. It was always Chris's thing. Oh, I guess it just slipped out. That's Chris's number. He's wearing Chris's number, right? Yeah, he wanted to as tribute. You okay? You okay? Yeah. Okay, let's take a breather. Chris? No. Absolutely not. It's the truth, that's what you guys wanted. You were not texting at the time of the accident. Yes I was. No, you were not. Because if you were, it's no longer an accident. It becomes a felony. You do understand what happens, right? After a felony indictment, let alone a conviction? Do you want to destroy your future? There it is. I knew that this was coming. That's all you two care about is future, future, future. With good reason. There's no returning from a statement like this. It's the same as handing in a guilty plea. Well guess what? I am guilty. It's as simple as that. Young lady come back here right now. 21% report hearing them, 3% feeling their touch. Losing my father was probably the hardest thing I've ever had to- - And some people say that ones that have passed on, that they're actually coming to say hello. They're visiting with you and- - And she could feel her mother standing at the foot of her bed. An hour after he passed, I got a message on my phone. It was crazy. - Oh hey. - Hey hey. - Hi. - Oh, hello. Hey. What the heck am I doing? Damn it! Go home. I'm going home. Chris? Chris? Close your eyes. Oh my God, I can feel you. I can really feel you. It wasn't your fault Ry, it was an accident. You can't blame yourself. Of course, my imagination would make you say that. I've been reading up about grief. And I know that this is all just in my imagination. What, you think this is all in your head? It's my mind's way of coping with you being gone. I'm gonna tell you something you couldn't possibly know. My dad got me a watch just before he left, and I was so pissed that I buried it in my backyard by the shed. Find it for me, okay. Promise me you'll find it. I promise. Hello? Is everything all right? Riley? Riley? Yeah, coming Mom. Okay. Thank you. What's going on, honey? Is this all we have of my stuff? Maybe, I think there might be another box in the storage unit someplace. Why, do you need them for something? Do you remember this one? I made it for your 40th? Yes, Blue Rider, about the girl who took her horse into the city. Did you like it? Of course I did. What did you like about it? I love how much work you put into it. I think it's beautiful. It's detailed. But do you think it's good? I think lots of people, lots of artists are very good, even great. But only one or two out of 100 get to succeed at something- - Yeah, I got it Mom, thanks. You are my daughter, and I love you. I just want you to be successful. But do you think they're good? Do you? Do you think I'm good? I think you are better than good. I think you are incredible. Okay, it's that crab thing you like, with the actual crab, not with the fake stuff. You guys up for some sake bombs? Nate. No. Come on. I don't know when you became such a prude, Jules. It's like you're not even thinking. Boo, boo. Stop it. Oh my God. Are you already drunk? Just pre-gamed a little. It's all good in the hood. By the way, Riley. Heard the cops have been up your ass. Where'd you hear that? Around. Does it matter? So what, they think you were driving like a maniac or something? - Jesus, Nate. - My driving was fine. Except you crashed my car. So it wasn't that fine, am I right? Let it go. Two shots, two hours ago. That's what you said. Most of the night's still a blur, but that's coming through crystal clear you know. It sounds like you think that I was lying. Were you? Yeah. Freaking called it. But not about that. Your car, that you're too lazy to fix, that shouldn't be on the road, that's what happened. And I lied. I lied to protect you. I lied to protect your life, to protect my friend. Something wrong? I just don't like the taste. We also have pizza? That's gross. Hey, how was- - Great. What are you doing? Soul searching. This is ridiculous. Can you kiss me? Let's find out. This is real. I'm not making this up. It's not in my mind. I don't know what this means. How? I died, I kind of got stuck. Everything else, I don't know. You believe this? Yeah. That doesn't matter? Hey. Who's out there? Hey. Riley? Riley, can you come down to the kitchen please? Please have a seat, Riley. Mrs. Douglas has informed us that last night she caught you trespassing on her property- - Digging in my damn yard. Is that true? Yes. But I wasn't trying to trespass or anything. What were you doing there? I was looking for something. A watch. You stole a watch? It's hard to explain. Try. Chris told me to. Before my son died, he told you to go root around my shed? Hold on, Riley- - No, I mean you didn't think it was enough to kill him. You had to come lift his stuff too? Lee. Jesus, that's what you two do for a living, right? Protect the guilty, get rich doing it? Excuse me? That's how you keep your murderer daughter out of jail. Listen to me, Lee. I know you're hurting. I know what you're going through. But you're in the wrong to come here and call my daughter a murderer. You're wrong to blame her, and you know it. I don't care about the watch. Keep it. But, listen to me Riley. I can't see you because when I see your face, I see Chris, I see my boy. I don't know what to do. Riley? Hey? What is this music? Speaker volume 10. Well my question is, why do you always connect with her when I'm not around? No right, because when I'm with her I'm thinking about you, sure, right. Well there's always next time. So this thing is legit? That's what I've been telling you. Hey, you gonna show me how it works? What do you need it for? I thought you didn't give a shit about anyone anymore. I don't. So you gonna show me or not? How it works for us is, you need something you share, like a memory, or a strong emotion. For us it's Riley's drawing. Hey, what time is it? It's seven I think. Why? She used to play this for me every day after dinner. Every day, right around seven o'clock. It's really nice. Maybe that's it? Hey Dad. I'm doing great by the way. I'm dead, if you forgot. Hey, did you see any polar bears in Alaska? No? Weird. That's where Mom told us you went. And I get why. It's easier than telling your abandoned son that his dad was in the same freaking state the whole time! Joke's on me, huh? Did it work? And? Chris man, you need to focus on getting out of here all right. Like I said, most folks just skip. What? She's alive man. You're not. She'll eventually move on, and then you gonna have to face yourself. Face yourself? Are you kidding me? Or maybe you're just jealous of what I have? We're not talking about me, man. We're talking about you, all right. Well, what's holding you back, Jordan? 'Cause I'm not the one that's been stuck here for 30 years doing the same over and over and over again. Who the hell do you think you are? I'll tell you who you are. You're some nobody kid who got lucky enough to run into me, all right. I didn't have to show you the ropes around here but I did. After everything, you gonna come to me like this? I'm out. So what you want to do is grab the knife with your hand like that. Fingertips, on your knuckles. Yeah? Right up against that like that. Okay. And slice. There we go. How's that feel? I think I'm gonna be a TV dinner girl. No, you're not. You call yourself an adult, but you can't cook? All righty. I could definitely do this. Jules? Wait, slow down slow down. Where are you? Okay. Okay okay, I'm coming. You don't need to go to the cops. No, I have to. They need to know what I did. They need to know it was me. Nate. You said it yourself, Ry. I should have gotten my car fixed. So what, you're gonna walk in and say hey here's the deal, my bad, throw me in jail? Pretty much. I fucked up, right? It's time to face it. This isn't gonna help anyone. It'll help me. I'm losing my mind over this. This isn't what Chris would have wanted. Oh yeah? How do you know what Chris would have wanted? Come on. I want to show you guys something. Ry, are you sure about this? What are we doing? Seeing Chris. What? Look, if this doesn't work, I'll go to therapy and I'll admit that it's just grieving, okay. I'm in. Trust me, Jules. How do you know he's gonna come? He'll come. Is something gonna happen? What? I guess I thought that something was gonna happen. He's here. He's right here. Who is? Chris! They can't see me. No, but they have to. This has to work. Ry, I don't think this is good for you. Tell me something about Nate, something that only you would know. Ry, maybe we shouldn't. They have to understand. We have to go. This has to stop. Julia don't. Don't! He's dead. You need help. You need to live your life. This is my life. Have you looked at yourself lately? This isn't good for you, Ry. I love you, you're my best friend but, I can't watch you do this to yourself. So until you get help. Jules. Julia? You knew, you freaking knew. You chill. I don't know what you're talking about. Where are we? This is where it happened. Auntie brought my niece, Alicia, to the Christmas village. I tagged along. She was turning five. Auntie went to get us hot chocolate, she told me to look after Alicia. She wanted to go play, I told her not to go too far. I wasn't paying attention, and I lost her. Jordan, that must have been awful but, I don't understand what that has to do with- - You will. She was fine. Then she got sicker and sicker. And I ain't put it together until it was too late. But it was me, connecting with her. And now she's dead, thanks to you. Is she here? She skipped this level. Look, it ain't free. This connection? Somebody got to pay the price for it, with life. But we ain't got no more life to give, so it gotta come from somewhere. Well, my auntie didn't have many more years left anyway. So I guess it only took a few visits. But if you keep it up with your girl, it's gonna end the same way. So here comes the truth. There was no break-in, no fight, no shot. I didn't save my auntie. After I heard they found Alicia's body I, I came home, took out my belt. Jordan. Auntie found me. She never really recovered. You know maybe seeing me one more time before she died was what she needed. But you gotta stop, man. Your girl's got her whole life ahead of her. It's not yours to take away. Hey you. Ry, we need to talk. Don't go. You're gonna say that you have to go, and I'm telling you not to. I didn't realize it before but every time you visit me it changes me. No no, I mean the things that you say, that you like, that you don't like, they're becoming things that I say, things that I like. So maybe this means that this is just the beginning. Maybe we can bring you back or something, maybe we can. This is making you sicker and sicker, Ry. We have to stop. No, you don't get to decide that. I'm not losing you. I'm killing you. When I said that I wanted to let you go I was wrong. I don't want to. Those little bits that I left with you, they're always gonna be there. I thought that you wanted this. I thought that you wanted us to be together. Of course I do. Then don't leave. Come here. - I have to go. - No. - I have to go. - No, no, no! I love you. Chris? No! Stay Chris! Hey. Hey. Honey, I really think we should make a doctor's appointment for you, something's not... I'm fine. - No but- - I'm fine. I don't know, I guess I thought that'd be it. That that was the thing keeping me here. I'd let her go, and I'd move on. Saying it and meaning it are two different things. Hey. The detective was just telling us about a new development in your case that we thought you might want to hear. I did mean it. Really? Let me ask you a question. Would you still have said goodbye if you knew your visits weren't costing her her life? So the driver of the car that you rear-ended, we've learned that nine days before your accident he was given a ticket in Texas for a faulty brake light. Now so far, he's been unable to prove that he fixed the brake light. So if he still can't come up with this proof, all things being equal, I think we'll be able to close this case. If you could see her as much as you wanted, no problems, nothing bad happened after, if that was the way it was, would you still leave her alone? Thank you, detective, genuinely thank you. Hey, just doing my job. You drive safe, all right. Well of course I'd stay with her for as long as I could. You're not still here 'cause of her man. You still here 'cause of you. Not gonna forgive you. Not gonna get that from me, if that's what you're hoping for. I wasted so much of my life thinking about you. I'm done now. I hope you have a good life, Dad. I'm not kidding, I hope you do. That little boy looks like he really loves you. Maybe think of sticking around this time, huh? Dad? Riley. What are you doing here? He stopped coming. Chris, he stop coming. That's good. Is that all you came here for, to tell me that? No, I... Thank you for being my friend. And tell Nate that too. Wait. Riley? She's not with Julie either. We can track her phone. Riley! You came back to me. You came to me Riley, you shouldn't be here. There had to be another way for us to be together. And this is it. No, Ry. Let me go with you. I found my Dad, Ry. I told myself ever since I was a kid that I would never do what he did, I would never abandon the people I love. I was so scared that I couldn't see the truth. What truth? We have to move on. And I know it's gonna hurt. I know it's gonna hurt, but you're gonna be okay. No. No, not just okay, you're gonna be great. You're gonna be amazing. Wherever your life takes you, it'll be perfect. You gotta live for me, Ry. No. You have to be, you have to live for me, Ry. You have to live, Ry. Breathe for me, live for me. I have to move on. You have to live. Breathe Ry. Breathe Ry, breath. You can do it, come on. Breathe for me. Hold for pulse check. Come on, breathe for me. Hold for pulse check. Here we go, okay. You'll be fine no, okay. You'll be fine now. - There you go. - No! Riley. Baby. Just get the vitals for me, please? Hey guys just stay over for now. Are you guys family? Chris. Chris. There's a wooden box in my room. I was gonna give it to you when I finished it, but it doesn't look like I'm gonna get the chance. Open it, okay. I love you, Ry. Yeah you did good, man. Yeah, by the way, I never got a chance to thank you before you know, dipped out on me, so thank you for everything. I could join you but I think I'm good right here. Still got hands to hold. Ooh. What's up? I'm Jordan, and you look lost. It's all right. We both dead, in case you didn't know that already. Yes, breathe. Just chill, okay? Yeah I mean you're dead yeah, but it's all good. Wait. Please? Dear Ry, I'm not great at writing so don't make fund of me too much for this. You'll see I saved every piece you ever did for me. Even the little ones you wanted me to throw away. I stuffed them in my pocket when you weren't looking. This is what you were born to do, Ry. I know that probably doesn't mean much coming from somebody like me but, maybe it'll mean something coming from yourself. You're amazing, Riley. Don't give up on this. And when you publish your first graphic novel, I want a dedication right up front. Love, Chris. A fine arts minor? If it's possible, yes. Oh, it's definitely possible. It's just that generally we recommend a more complimentary minor for those pursuing law. I understand. Okay then, fine arts it is.
