Lee Doo Shik, Chief Prosecutor from Seoul Prosecutor's office Northern Division. Kim Sang Jil, Deputy Prosecutor from the Supreme Prosecutor's office. Prosecutor Hwang Il Su. Certificate of Appointment, Seoul Prosecutor's Office, Criminal Justice Division 1. Prosecutor Ma Hye Ri. {\a6}Fly high, so fly high, so fly high! {\a6}Go to the sky! {\a6}So fly high, so fly high, so fly high! {\a6}Go to the sky! {\a6}Now it's time to fly! {\a6}The heart, burn up. Engines, turn up {\a6}The dreams hidden in the heart will unfold. {\a6}Believe only me {\a6}I'll hold your hand. {\a6}I can make your dream come true. {\a6}Fly high. Your mother collapsed? Yes. They say she's gone into the operating room. So you see, I can't possibly... going to the workshop would be hard. Ah, of course. That would be the case. Your name is... Ma Hye Ri. Prosecutor Ma Hye Ri. Aigoo, on such a happy day as this... I have to hurry to the hospital. I'll be going now. {\a6}Give me, give me, give me all your heart. {\a6}We're making real love. {\a6}Come into my world. {\a6}Please come closer to me, {\a6}so I can feel you. {\a6}So I can stay in your embrace. {\a6}Come to me. {\a6}Take me, take me, take me to your heart. {\a6}I'll show you real love {\a6}now and forever. {\a6}Being together with you, {\a6}this moment... This looks really good on you too. Since your figure is so good to begin with. I'll take this. And this, this, this... and that. - I'm going to wear this out. - Yes. Uh, hey Yoo Na. You bought a new ski outfit and new skis? You already have some. Hey, what if my dad sees me loading the car and I get caught? Aigoo, you just didn't want to wear a 2-year old outfit. Of course, since I couldn't go during my time at the institute. Anyhow, I'm going up ahead and skiing, so don't be late. I just need to check inventory so I'll be leaving shortly. I'm really looking forward to it. Hey, just thinking about it, I feel like my heart is going to burst, Hey, it's all because of me, the complimentary ticket and the suite, even! Don't forget it. So I took two more of my mom's credit cards. But, how did you keep your dad from going to the Appointment Ceremony? Lee Yoo Na, don't you know I have a sharp mind? My IQ, 128! I heard you lost consciousness! You lost consciousness and 911 had to come haul you off, and when you arrived at the hospital, you were suddenly okay?! Yes, I guess so. Then, why'd you collapse at home? You collapsed suddenly, your eyes rolled, and you couldn't breathe. That's what I heard! So maybe, could it have been anemia? At your size, anemia? Anemia? Anemia has nothing to do with size. So you collapse with anemia, and near death, you called me? When you weren't even going to die? On a day like today. Exactly at that hour! If it was that important to snap a photo with your daughter in a prosecutor's robe, then you should have gone, whether you're mourning for your wife or not. What did you come for? I came to mourn for my wife. I came because I thought you were dying. Otherwise, would I have missed my daughter's appointment ceremony? Oh my... It's the day that Ma Sang Tae's daughter becomes a prosecutor. A prosecutor! Prosecutor Ma Hye Ri! I should have gotten a picture at least. You're about as useful as dog dung! You worried a lot, didn't you, President Ma? Doctor Kang. My wife... what happened? {\a6}Fly high, so fly high, so fly high! Because of my prosecutor daughter, it looks like I'll be getting a CT scan, an MRI, the works! It's not a bad thing to get your health checked. I had my regular exam last month. Mom, are you getting mad at me? I know if you can't do what your mind is set on, your stubbornness is unbearable, so I went with it. But I'm wondering if I really have to go this far. I can be a prosecutor even if I don't go to the workshop, but if it's not today, I may never see this baby. Mom, this baby is going to be the finishing touch to your daughter's life. I told you not to use words I don't know! The look on your father now makes me think he'll grind us to a pulp if he finds out. There's no way I'm going to get caught. Mom, I'll bring home a pretty baby for you too. Okay, it's a Grace bag for me. Okay! {\a6}We're creating a love that won't ever stop {\a6}When you fall, when things get tough, when you start to hate hiding it, {\a6}Be yourself and hold my hand. Hey, fly to your dream! {\a6}Now it's time to fly! {\a6}The heart will burn up. Engines, turn up. {\a6}The dreams hidden in the heart will unfold. {\a6}Believe only me {\a6}I'll hold your hand. {\a6}I can make your dream come true. {\a6}Fly high. As expected, she went to ski first. {\a6}[Launch Ceremony Auction] Gioberni Launch Ceremony Auction. 9:00. If Kim Dong Seok is really coming to the ski resort, he'll probably attend, don't you think? He didn't come to ski, but probably came to see that. This brand obtained almost all of Grace Kelly's clothes. Even now, there is a limited edition of the Grace line, and apparently, the women are crazy about it. Because women all dream of being a princess. Ma Hye Ri. Prosecutor Ma Hye Ri, you've suffered much. You've worked hard; I'm proud of you. Now your suffering is all over. What's left in your life now, is to go on the count of one! Prosecutor Yoon went where? Three years ago, there was a case called Watchgate where 80,000 won watches were sold at a launch show, as Swiss name brands, to the tune of 200 Million Won. The one where even celebrities bought in great quantities? The wealthy, celebrities, and retailers lost almost 30 Billion Won, But during the search for evidence, they lost the suspect, Kim Dong Seok, right in front of their eyes. It turns out he was working the local circuit in black market counterfeit brands. Was that Yoon Se Jun's case? Today, there's a brand name launch at that ski resort. They received a tip that Kim Dong Seok might go there. Might go? On a tip that he might go, not that he will go, the prosecutor raced up there? Without even reporting to the Chief? Chief, that's the guy. Ahh. That's the guy? He's been searching for him for three years. But still... He should have reported before he left. All right. Get to work. [Counterfeit Goods Suspect Search] They say it's the most popular ski suit this year. But, what kind of history do you have with this guy that you would... Because Gioberni is a brand that's popular with the Hollywood set, it's got a stamp of approval in this country too. If they launch and set up operations, then the fakes will surface right away, so-called "brand name" products any dog or cow can forge. The first guy to copy it will hit the jackpot. Since copying the design is the object, he'll show up at the launch show. Take a good look. Oh, what time is it? Already?! Why hasn't Yoo Na even called? Ah, my phone. Oh? Oh?! Hey!! Thief! Hey! It's a thief! Hey! Hey! Stop there! Wh-what... What should I do? Oh no, what now? Report him. Police! Oh no, he even took my phone. What am I supposed to do?! Aigoo. My cards. My cards. My cards! Your car was broken into? Please report it to the police and have them come, and check me into the suite. Ah yes. No! Report it. But, don't have them come right away. Have them come after the launch show. Ah, yes. Oh no, no, no. I'll go to my room and report it, so just check me in. Yes. But someone has already checked into the suite room. Excuse me? Someone has checked in? They just checked in. Ah! Oh, that's fine. That girl is a ditz. Yoo Na! Yoo Na, open the door! C'mon! Oh, Yoo Na, I... Who are you? You're the one who rang the bell and knocked on the door. Uhhh, that's because... that's our room... Did Yoo Na bring you? No. Then why are you in there? Because it's my room. Excuse me? They say they definitely have a record of someone giving your name and cancelling the room. Someone else has already checked in here. I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. I definitely reserved the suite and never cancelled it. Ahh, I'm gonna go nuts. Anyhow, it was your responsibility so you come and resolve it. Where are you and why aren't you here yet? I left you a message that I couldn't make it. I kept calling, but you wouldn't answer. You can't make it?! There was a reservation for a party dress presentation, but the party was suddenly moved earlier. It looks like I'm going to be here all night. Hey, my bag was stolen! You have to come no matter what! The clients have already come and are waiting for me. Are you still in Seoul? Hey, how much is it? I'll give it to you, so come right now and bring your card. They are VVIP clients. It's not just one, it's eight. So, I'm asking how much is that?! I said I'd give it to you! Hye Ri, I'm sorry. Hey! Hey! If you don't come, what am I supposed to do? What about the Gioberni launch show? What about my Grace shoes?! If you don't come, you and I are through! Hey! Hello? Hey, Yoo Na! Hey! Oh? Oh geez! You heard it, right? My friend never cancelled the reservation. It seems that way, but on our hotel computer, it's definitely shown as cancelled. Oh, that's fine. I'll give it up. Just give me another room since I have to change. - Quickly, quickly... - We don't have any empty rooms. You don't? It's the Valentine's season, and next week our ski resort will be closed. Then, where am I supposed to sleep tonight? Then, I can't give up this room. You heard that there are no empty rooms, right? So? - So you should give up the room. - Why? Because I'm a man and you're a woman? We made the reservation first, and the cancellation, when it's been investigated, will certainly turn out as a hotel error. A hotel error, not my error. I've already paid for the hotel room. I'll give you double the cost of the room. I'll give you double what you paid for the hotel. When? Excuse me? When are you going to give me twice the cost of the room? Didn't you say you lost your wallet? Do you have cash? I can tell them to send the money to the hotel. Tell who? My father. Ah, there was that method. Then, where would I go? When there's no empty rooms? Well, well, is this the only hotel? You can go to another hotel. Then you do that. Guest, where shall I put this? Please leave it on the table. - Yes. - Thank you. Do you think a man would use a suite alone on Valentine?s Day? If you weren't going to give it up, then why were you acting like you were going to give it up? When did I? Didn't you ask me when I was going to pay you, whether or not I had cash? I was just thinking maybe you forgot that you lost your wallet, so I was just reminding you. Guest, our manager said he would find a room for you nearby. Is there a hotel nearby? It's not a hotel, but a motel. Mo-tel? It's definitely not the hotel's error, but because your situation seems so dire... I've relayed the message, so I'll be stepping out now. What, what do they take me for? Do you want to use the room together? I can't give you the whole suite, but I can let you sleep here. What are you saying? If you don't have a place to go, I thought I'd let you share a room. Even if I have one room, I don't think it would be that bad. Aren't you waiting for your girlfriend? I am waiting for a woman. Are you crazy? I have an announcement. Shortly, beginning at 9 o'clock, the Gioberni Launch Ceremony Auction will begin. All clients who plan to attend are asked to gather in ten minutes. Please let me repeat... Oh? Ah! It's a relief there's just one thing I don't take after my mother in, not feeling sleepy in the early evening. Mom. We're not getting a divorce. Why not? Because you're pregnant? You said once, didn't you... Sang Shik is a good man. Oh! Aigoo. Let's go. I'm sorry, but can I borrow your phone? I've forgotten mine. I don't see him. What about you? I don't see him yet. It's been over an hour since it started. He's been on the run for three years. His funds are probably gone. They don't say a life of crime is scary for nothing. And an accomplice might be here in his place. An accomplice? Someone could win a bid on a product and make a copy, so during the auction, keep a sharp lookout. Don't just look at the men, but be wary of the women as well. Okay. Gioberni, a company that with a 133 year history, has a tradition of launching lines overseas with a launch auction. At this Korean launch, we are featuring the very special and prized limited edition Grace line. The proceeds of the sales will go to feed the nation's children in poverty, so we ask for your generous interest. Then we'll begin. Can I borrow your phone just once more? It's behind me so just take it. Is the auction over already? No, not yet. Then why did you call me? Have you taken all the pictures? [Have you been caught?] Hello? The wedding shoes that Grace Kelly wore were remade with a modern style and are a classic Gioberni Limited Edition. Each year, only 7 pairs are made by the head designer... Mom, they have to send the money to the hotel, no matter what. Okay? No matter what. ... this one especially for the Korea launch auction. Then we'll start the bidding at 1.8 million won. 1.9 2 million 2.2 2.3 2.5 2.7 2.8 The bid is at 2.8 million. 3 million. Yes, 3 million. 4 million. It's at 4 million. 4.5 It's at 4.5 million 5 million. 5 million. 6 million. 6 million. No other bids? 6 million. If there's no bid higher than 6 million. 7 million. We have a bid at 7 million. There are no more bids? Grace Wedding Shoes have been sold to client number 7. Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you! Yeah, Prosecutor Jin. Yeah. What? Client, really why are you doing this? I'll leave my car as collateral. You can keep my car overnight, and I'll bring the money in the morning. We have to go back to Seoul tonight too. Let's take my car. That works out well since I live in Seoul too. You ladies don't seem to understand the legalities very well. Section Chief Lee, Kim Dong Seok has come with a woman. {\a6}Is there anything in the Gioberni Auction documents Her name is Lee Moon Hae. Prosecutor Jin said she got a rental car. {\a6}that requires the winning bidder payment within a few hours? So, find the women from the auction. There isn't, is there? So, as the winning bidder... This won't do. Let's report it to the police. - Okay - Just a moment! I came just for this baby. I didn't come to ski. I came to get this baby, but when I got here, my bag was stolen. Just a second. Oh? That man. Excuse me a minute You thief! You jerk! Where's my bag?! Where did you go and sell my bag?! Prosecutor! What are you?! Move! Prosecutor, are you okay? Kim Dong Seok. Kim Dong Seok? Prosecutor? Not a detective? My shoes. Where's my baby? Where are my shoes? Someone else bought them. My shoes? You sold them? How can you do that? I won the bidding. I'm sorry. If you have a problem with how we handled it, please take legal actions. Oh! Oh! Oh, you can't, Prosecutor! You can't, you can't! Call for back up right away, and block all the car exits. And don't let the Lee Moon Hae's rental car get out. Okay. I'll get cooperation from the local police, So search the parking lot and find the car. Ahh, and after you were so right on with your feeling that Kim Dong Seok was here! Today wasn't supposed to be like this. This isn't supposed to be a day like this. I lost my shoes. And I'm hungry. And I want to go home. Mom. Oh! why is everything going wrong today?! Why are you doing this to me, really?! Client, your insurance company people have arrived at our ski resort. Really? Yes, but there are two broken down cars near the ski slope, and on the lower side there are also two cars waiting. Altogether four cars? Yes. How long do they say I have to wait? I think at least two to two and a half hours. Just a moment. There have been no phone calls for client Ma Hye Ri. Why don't you call somewhere else? Maybe a friend of a friend or well maybe your in-laws' second cousins? There are lots of people. You don't think I want to? Other than the numbers of Mom, Dad, Home and Yoo Na, Im Mi Kyung 6, Go Min Ji 7, Jee Hin 8, Hae Sook 35, aesthetician 11, Im Ki Sa 53, Yoo Kang Ho 17. I just remember the quick dial numbers. Oh? Those are my shoes. Who is it? Uh? What are you doing here? I'm here to share the room, I mean, you told me I could share the room. Wouldn't that be a little complicated for us to share the same room? No, no, I'm saying I'll use the empty room. Really? I was going to Seoul, but the tire's flat. And the service people won't be here for another two and a half hours. What an unlucky day. I guess your girlfriend will say I can't? Use the second floor. But, you have to pay half. Ask your girlfriend first. She hasn't come? She's not going to come? I'm waiting. Ahh. I'll see you in the morning. Mmm. Is he going night skiing and waiting till she gets here? He must really like her. Whoever she is, she's a lucky woman. She didn't come to a man that would prepare this kind of thing for her? She didn't come because she didn't know. What will we do if he leaves his car and flees? - He's probably already fled. - Excuse me? We can block the cars from leaving this way, but there are tons of little paths that people can come and go through. Ay, if it wasn't for that nut-job, we could have caught Kim Dong Seok. It's done. - Section Chief Lee, look in the trunk. - Yes. She won't come. She's not coming. That woman doesn't have the right to wear Grace shoes. Really, why would you give shoes to a woman who doesn't even show up. Tch, are shoes that laughable? Are they laughable? Are they laughable? Move! Get away! You wanna die! Get away! Move! Move, move! Get away. This door and the bathroom door were all open. Hurry, get out! Get out! Give me your car keys. So, she really didn't come. I just ordered. Because I figured the one getting a free meal wouldn't make a fuss about the menu. Who's getting a free meal? I'm going to pay it all back. This is my style. It's good I ordered that. You're swollen, aren't you? Are you swollen? How much is enough? Half the hotel room, the breakfast, and what else? Ah, the tire repair cost. How much was it? Write it all down. Don't leave out a won. Why don't you add another 100,000 won? I have to put gas in the car and pay the toll gate. You know you're asking a total stranger for 100,000 rather shamelessly, don't you? Write down your account number; I can get it transferred right away. I don't have my account number memorized. You don't have your account number memorized?! The secretary does the banking. Or I do internet banking. Call me when you get the money. You're not going to check my identity? What if I don't call? What are you going to show me so that I can check your identity? Your citizen registration? You don't have your ID. You're not going to pay me back? Why wouldn't I pay you back? It's not like it's that much. Fine, then. Yesterday, you were stood up, weren't you? The woman you were waiting for didn't show up. Then, what are you going to do with those? She didn't come because you bought that sort of thing and waited. You're not supposed to buy shoes for a woman you like. They say she'll put them on and walk off with another man. Is there such a saying? How entertaining. I should give them to her and see if that really happens. What if they don't fit? Do you know her shoe size? They probably fit. I knew it. That Grace line, not any woman can wear them. You know Paris Hilton, right? No matter how much money she has, she can't wear them. Because her feet are too big. Paris's feet are 280, but those Grace shoes only come in Grace Kelly's size, which in our country's sizing is 235. Are you a shoeholic? You know all kinds of trivia. Is your girlfriend 235? Well, there are lots of women who seem to want them, even though they can't wear them. So, you're going to give them to her? Is there any reason I can't? Why would you give them to a woman who never even came?! Then what should I do? I can't give them to just anyone, and I can't throw them away. You can sell them to me. Their owner was originally me. If I just hadn't lost my bag... I won them in the bid, but you bought them when I wasn't looking. Are you making a fuss right now? I... came here to buy those shoes. But after coming here, I lost my bag, got my reservation cancelled, slept upright, and went through all sorts of hell! Do you have to toss them to a woman who doesn't even want them? Do you? {\a6}Give me, give me, give me all your heart. {\a6}We're making real love. {\a6}Come into my world. {\a6}Please come closer to me {\a6}so I can feel you. {\a6}So I can stay in your embrace. {\a6}Come to me. {\a6}Take me, take me, take me to your heart. {\a6}I'll show you real love {\a6}now and forever {\a6}Being together with you, Oh my gosh! {\a6}this moment, {\a6}I wish time would stop. {\a6}Together with you forever. {\a6}I must be too late {\a6}to get into your heart. {\a6}Someone else is already there, {\a6}I know very well. {\a6}But I have no choice, {\a6}I keep falling, falling into your heart. Ta da! Aren't they pretty? Aren't they pretty? They're lovable, yet sexy! Huh? Huh? Well, they don't look worth writhing over for a couple of years. All the women who've worn these wedding line shoes have all become happy. Who wore them and how did they become happy? You know Demi Moore. She married a man 16 years younger than her. Demi met Austin after she started wearing this line. And Grace Kelly became a princess. But what money did you buy these with? Didn't you say your bag was stolen? Huh? Call me when you get the money. Where'd it go? Where'd it go? Oh geez. You still haven't been able to find it? I can't find it anywhere! Where'd it go? You said you didn't even have your bag and put it in your pocket. I did, but it's not here. Aigoo, with the shoes... If I don't pay this back, he's going to think I'm a total con! But he loaned you all that money, and he only gave a measly phone number? Do I look like I'd rip someone off? But still... With such deep pockets, you think he might be a second generation tycoon? Where is it? Welcome. Aigoo, Nui (sister)! Welcome Master Seo. I told you to go out with your friends if you're lonely to the point of tears. You're so lonely, you can't even swallow the soju. How'd you know? It's been over two hours since you opened the soju bottle. It's flat and tepid. Next time I'm born, I'm going to have to live with a man that's an artist. So, you want to live with a man again the next time you're born? How tedious. To live with a man who would know what a woman is feeling before she opens her mouth, I just want to know what that would feel like. What's happened in the last few days that you're talking like this? Who is it this time? Then are you an official prosecutor starting tomorrow? Where's your office? For a few months, I don't get my own office. I have to learn in a sunbae's (senior's) office. In any case, children and adults alike will come in front of you and address you as Prosecutor, right? Prosecutors are addressed Prosecutor, Teachers addressed Teacher, Reporters addressed Reporter... Why get so excited about something that's basically obvious? Are all titles created equal? A long time ago, even newbie judges and prosecutors were called Lord. It's not like that these days, Dad. It's totally different from a long time ago. Right, right. Prosecutors these days get badmouthed at the drop of a dime. What do you know about it? Geez. I'm not making it up. - In the newspapers and on the TV... - Eh hey! Wherever ten people gather, there will be good, bad and strange folk mixed in. But if a rich man is ruined, he can still survive one way or another for three years. You think that saying is for nothing? Whatever is he talking about? Our household, with Hye Ri, has gone up a rung and our status... All of us, especially you, should make a little more effort. Aigoo. Prosecutor. Oh! Good Morning. What are you doing here so early this morning, the set of you? You said a new appointee was coming today and not to be late. Was that today? Yes. I hear that this new appointee is a piece of work. Quite a reputation at the Judicial Research and Training Institute. Chief, it looks like you're in for a bit of a headache. Maybe at the training center, but could it still be true now? {\a6}Fly high, so fly high, so fly high! {\a6}Go to the sky! {\a6}So fly high, so fly high, so fly high! {\a6}Go to the sky! Prosecutor Lee, it looks like your eyes may fall out. I was just wondering if it was our new appointee. It couldn't possibly be, could it? It looks like she might be here to collect payment on some credit. It's not our division, is it? Hello. Oh, good morning! Of course the new appointee should come early and be waiting. Ah, hello. I'm Prosecutor Ma Hye Ri. They told me to come to Central District, Criminal Justice Division 5 starting today. Ahhh, ah, yes. Ah, um, um. Go introduce yourself to the District Attorney and the Assistant DA. Ah, yes, okay. Did you go introduce yourself? Yes. Is there something you want to say to me? It's this office. First introduce yourself to the head prosecutor, and then, see me later. Yes, okay. [Prosecutor Yoon Se Jun] [Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office] {\a6}[Criminal Justice Division 5] [Head Prosecutor] So this woman is Lee Moon Hae, Kim Dong Seok's partner. So, then who was the nut-job who jumped on you that time? What can I help you with? Can you tell me where Prosecutor Yoon Se Jun might be? Who are you? I'm prosecutor Ma Hye Ri, and I'm supposed to be training in this office. Prosecutor? Ahh, I had heard a new prosecutor appointee was supposed to come in. I'm Section Chief Lee Woo Hyung. Prosecutor. I'm prosecutor Yoon Se Jun. Ah, hello. I'm prosecutor Ma Hye Ri... You jerk! Where's my bag? Where have you sold off my bag? Oh! Prosecutor Ma Hye Ri? Ah, yes. Section Chief Lee, you've met. And this is Office Administrator Jin Mi Sun. Ah, hello. I'm prosecutor Ma Hye Ri. Your desk is over there. Yes. He doesn't recognize me? Please sit. He must really not remember me. ... and each went their own way? You say it's not so? Then, are you admitting to the charge? If I admit to the crime, can I get out faster? Are you admitting to the charge? If I can get out quickly by saying I did it, then let's say that I was the one who threw away the memory card. Are you trying to negotiate with a prosecutor right now? How could that be?! The room is so filled with the smell of cosmetics, that my mind is dizzy. Hey, Agassi (young lady). Get me a glass of water, will you? Pretty Agassi, I'm dying of thirst. I'm not an agassi. I'm a prosecutor. Agassi, you say you're a prosecutor? Can't I be questioned by the pretty prosecutor? Ahjussi, what are you doing? Where are you looking? What the hell is going on?! This kind of thing happens because a prosecutor doesn't act like a prosecutor. You need to come to the prosecutor?s office as a prosecutor, not as a woman. So, you're saying my skirt length today is a little too short, and that my stockings are excessive, right? I will tone it down starting tomorrow. I think that, um, each person has a very different style. Didn't you say there was something else that the new appointee was responsible for? Not just as the new appointee, but as the newest prosecutor, there's a lot that you need to do. - Follow me. - Yes. Every day before noon, get your sunbae's opinions, organize a menu, organize a menu, make restaurant reservations, and collect the lunch money. Sunbae, it's time for lunch. Track down your sunbaes each month on payday, to collect the lunch money. - Sunbae, it's lunch time. - Ah, okay. And there is the responsibility of the daily, weekly, and monthly publications. For each of the cases that the sunbaes are managing, the new appointee will do a short summary of any relevant articles. Yes. Prosecutor, there is a welcome dinner out tonight. Since you've flipped the office upside down on your first day, let's try to make up for it at dinner. Um, but why are we just standing here? We're waiting for the sunbaes and then going to the restaurant together. We're going to dinner tonight and now, lunch too? I can miss it if I have a previous engagement, right? Aigoo! I'll see you at dinner. [Prosecutor Lee Min Seok, Prosecutor Choi Ji Yoon, Prosecutor Jin Jung Seon...] Prosecutor, here are your cases. R cases again. Ask, if you have any questions. Okay. Today, in the company of these capable and solid hoobaes (juniors), and undoubtedly headed to become that kind of hoobae, the prosecutor with great fashion sense, newly appointed Ma Hye Ri, I'm in a great mood. In the hopes that yet another hoobae will serve well our country and our people... May you become a big prosecutor! Yes. Prosecutor Ma. Here comes another one. Where are we going for the second round? Second round. Ah. Ah, yes, we should go for a second round. Let's go for a second round. Let's go, let's go. Thank you. Our office newbie! I have a charm that's easy to be afraid of. It's all to tempt you. Hand and foot, do it! Turn on the moonlight, and shine it on my heart! Haha! Why do you keep looking at me-ee? Have you gone and fallen for me-ee? When someone's hot for me, I don't know what to do. I don't even know how to act I'm so hot. I'm too pretty. I'm so hot. I'm too charming... - Oh, no no no... - Third round... Go on home, Chief. Go carefully! - Goodbye - Goodbye. Let's go for a third round. Third round. Eh? - Let's go for third round. - Goodnight! Prosecutor Ma! Where'd it go? I'm so hot... Aigoo! Let's just go for a third round on our own. You went out for dinner and ate recklessly, didn't you? What did you eat? How much did you eat? Get on. Aigoo, geez. You went down 300 grams. I told you I didn't eat. About Prosecutor Ma, it was a little shocking yesterday, wasn't it? It didn't look like she would get overly stressed. I wonder how much of a better state she'll be in today. She doesn't seem like the type to change overnight. Are you two dating? Why did you ride in together? Are you married?! Sunbae, please go on in first. Prosecutor Ma, didn't you assure me yesterday, you'd rectify the way you dressed? I did rectify it. This is 1 centimeter longer than the skirt I wore yesterday, and I'm not wearing fishnet stockings, either. Are you playing with me? Do you seriously hear what you're spitting out? Just because you can spit out words, doesn't mean they're worth saying! How can a new appointee stand in front of a sunbae and tell a bald-faced lie. But, I was just doing it out of consideration for you in my own way. What? It's better than saying from the beginning that I absolutely don't want to. Absolutely don't want to? What? Then, are you saying you're going to keep dressing like that? In the constitution, there's a clause about the personal pursuit of happiness. We are public servants, representing the country. In the National Public Service Laws, is there anything about the length of a woman's skirt or standard of makeup? As a public servant, there is a level of form and dignity we need to maintain. Is that level specified by law? Hey, Ma Hye Ri! Before I'm a prosecutor, I'm a woman, so I'm going to exercise the right to dress how I want. You want to prance around like that even after getting sexually harassed by suspects yesterday? You can't avoid making bean paste because you're afraid of maggots. If you're going to be like this, don't be a prosecutor!! - Excuse me? - You! Do you know how hard it is to be a prosecutor in this country? It's people like you that give female prosecutors a bad name! Even prosecutors that aren't female get badmouthed when they deserve it. Are you saying you're going to continue like this to the end?! But, you saying whether I should be or not be a prosecutor, there's really no legal right for you to be saying that, is there? I'll be going now. Unbelievable. Mun Young Ho, you took someone else's wallet, not yours, out of the Internet Cafe, correct? Yes. And you took the money out, correct? Yes. Oh. And it looks like you threw the empty wallet out in the bathroom? Yes. And the amount of money you took from the wallet was 63,000 won. - Um... - Just a second. With that 63,000, you ate pork belly with your wife, paid hospital bills and bought rice. Is that all correct? That's true, Prosecutor, but... You were caught because the hall surveillance camera caught you taking the wallet into the bathroom. Right? - Prosecutor... - Wait just a moment. The law for repeat offenders states that there will be an added penalty to your sentence. ...added penalty... But even so, we can't let a thief off. I'm not asking you to let a thief off, but you could have fined him instead. It's not necessarily befitting to be absolutely penalty-minded. If it goes to court and gets an added penalty, he could get a prison sentence. But, I only acted on the fundamental principles. After doing time for robbery, before three years passed, he robbed again. You have to consider his situation as well. He hurt his arm and couldn't work for three months, so his pregnant wife couldn't go to the hospital, and starved for two days. Why do I... need to consider his personal situation? I'm a prosecutor, not a social worker. How could I consider each of the personal situations of the hundreds of suspects that come in every month? Well, what you're saying isn't wrong. Let's stop talking about it. What a strange person. What's he doing here? Did he come to collect his money? Please, have a seat. Okay. No, he can't!!

Do you think there's a curse on the ski resort? The two men you met at the ski resort both turned out not to like you. I have my own schedule every night. - Hey!! - Why am I... How could you not know what you've done wrong?! In choosing this career, there is one thing you must do, whether you like it or not, being prudent and cautious. I've met the person I had to meet. Become independent? Asa! You came to congratulate my becoming independent? Do you have an interest in me? Of course. Someone else is already there I know very well, but I have no choice I keep falling, falling into your heart. Everyday I want to be with you. Tonight should I tell you that I like you? Making shining light, making hot love together, making you my baby, come to my world. Give me, give me, give me all your heart. We're making real love. Come into my world.
