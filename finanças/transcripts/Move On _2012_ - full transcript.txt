So, where are we at? In our line of work we're taught bad, bad things but never bad manners. Hello Lena. How have you been? What happened in Hungary? Very interesting. Seems like your girlfriend isn't ready to be introduced to the family. She wasn't lying when she said her name was Alicia. One of many names, many countries. Greta Landwehr. Patricia Smith. No way to tell who she really is. Just like you. And the black Cayenne. Any connections to her? Doesn't look like it. We were able to track down the unfortunate guys you wrecked. Or what was left of them. And? No names. No identities. No past, present or future. I'm still working on them. I won't bother you with the details, but there's a mole in our outfit. Someone's been feeding them information. I see. And who exactly are we up against, Lena? Let's just say weíre happy itís not them holding the case. It's been sanctioned. And we will be watching. Take care of it. And what if she knows what's in the case? Do you? I have an idea. Yeah. I doubt this girl is stupid enough to open it. The fact that she somehow managed to steal from our 'golden boy' gives the case enough value for her to sell it. Knowing, or not knowing itís contents. Are your feelings getting in the way here? Outdone by a girl? See you around, Lena. Apartment 101. Wilhelmstrasse 70. Berlin. 1 Million. Thursday, 3pm. Meet me at &quot;Alexander Platz&quot;. 5pm. Bring the phone. I'm here. Of course you are. Weltzeituhr. Behind you. I see you. Go there. Quick, quick, quick. We don't have all day. Stop there. Stay there. And now what? Now you wait. Try to do that one more time and you'll never see the case again. Do you understand? Turn around. Face the tracks. Do you see me? I see you. Come towards me. Stop. Show me the money. Show me the fucking money! Ok. This is how we're gonna do this. On my &quot;Go&quot; we put the bags down and move across the tracks. And we keep moving. Do you understand? Tell me you understand. I understand. Ok. Put the bag down. Here we go. Nice and slow. I've got the case. Bring them in. Ah, fuck!! Tell me you've got your fucking eyes on her. Drop the gun. Drop it. And the case too. Take the chair. Sit. Sit down. I should've done this back in Slovakia. Put a bullet in your face. But it would've been too easy. Too easy. You got your money. This is not about money. OK. What? What do you want? You want the case? No. This is not about the case. I thought the apartment may have refreshed your memory... No. What? The young girl in the picture? Smiling with her Mummy and Daddy... Happy. Before you ripped us apart. Do you remember it? No. I don't remember anything. No names, no faces. They had names. Look at me. They had names. Mathias. And my little sister. Sofia. I'm sorry. What? What? I'm sorry. There was not supposed to be anyone up there. Everything went wrong and then... I'm... I'm sorry. I've asked for forgiveness. Not from me, you haven't. Look at me. Not from me. Do you want me to forgive you? Then I forgive you. I have the case. Money is gone, girl is gone. What do you mean the money is gone? Excactly what i'm telling you. She got away in a car. I'm coming in now. It was the case or the girl, I told you. The case is there. Right? You'd rather have the girl? Let it go, Lena. Let go off a milion euros just like that. Sure why not. I know who the mole is. He knows whats in the case and where its going. I'm afraid I'm gonna need one last favour from you. Do you unterstand? Take care of yourself, Marc. Did you loose your bearings? No. There were some issues. Here. The coordinates. After this I'm out. This is the end. As was agreed. We won't talk anymore. This is the last time you see me. You always do weak. Too much emotions. That's cool enough. Yeah, maybe. Maybe you are right. I told it to Anton. They don't listen. The old fool. They don't listen. It's been a pleasure working with you. Violence is... Sir. Would you like a new car? Car? This? That's your car down there. Have a nice day. Thank you.
