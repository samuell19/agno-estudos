(WOMAN NARRATING) 'The world blew up in a thousand atomic fireballs. 'The first blast was set off by five terrorists. 'It took two million years 'for some of the radioactive clouds to allow some sun in. 'By then, only a handful of humans survived. 'The rest of humanity had changed into hideous mutants. 'These mutant species floundered in the bad areas, 'radioactive lands that never allowed them to become human again 'and made each birth a new disaster. 'Then, in the good lands, 'they came back, arising from their long sleep. 'Fairies, elves, dwarves, 'the true ancestors of man. 'They lived happily in the good areas. 'It was a big day in Montagar. 'Delia, queen of the fairies, was presiding over the feast of plenty, 'celebrating 3,000 years of peace. 'In the midst of the celebration, 'Delia felt a pull from the skies. 'She looked up and saw dark clouds forming... on the horizon in every direction. 'She fell into a trance and left the party, 'heading for her home on a high hill. 'At first, the fairies were puzzled. 'But then they too felt a force drawing them to follow. 'Delia was alone inside. 'The storm grew until it was a raging cyclone 'hovering over the dwelling. 'One of the older fairies ventured inside the house. 'There lay Delia on her bed, 'holding a pair of twins in her arms. 'The older fairy instantly knew 'that these were not ordinary twins but magical wizards. 'The baby wizards were polarized like magnets, 'one attracting with a magnetic draw, 'the other repelling and impossible to get near. 'Avatar, the kind and good wizard, 'spent much of his boyhood 'entertaining his mother with beautiful visions. 'Blackwolf, the mutant wizard, would never visit his mother, 'and spent his time torturing small animals. 'More years passed, and Delia continued to slip. 'Finally, all life drained out of her, 'and Avatar held her hand 'trying desperately to use his magic to restore her. 'He cradled her in his arms and wept. 'When Blackwolf found that his mother had died, he was excited, 'for now he felt he would take over her leadership and rule the land. 'When Avatar confronted Blackwolf, he was enraged. 'They began a furious battle. 'Each using his magic, 'they continued until they had nearly destroyed each other. 'But Avatar's magic was stronger, 'because he had the emotional loss of his mother that drove him on. 'Blackwolf was defeated. "'The day will come, my brother, when I will return and make this a planet where mutants rule.'" 'Blackwolf headed off, leaving Avatar very disturbed.' (BLACKWOLF) The time has come. Kill! (LAUGHING) Well, hello, handsome. (BOINGS) Hello, honey. (NARRATOR) 'He is called Necron 99. 'He is one of Blackwolf's assassins. 'He travels the land destroying the believers of magic.' (CHAINS CLINKING) (HORSE NEIGHING) (MALE VOICE) "My children, the only true technology is nature." "All the other forms of man-made technology are perversions." "The ancient dictators used technology to enslave the masses." (GUNSHOT) (CROWS CAWING) (SMASHING AND SPLINTERING) Weehawk, can't we stay here for the night? - No. - Just for a few hours' rest? - I sense something. - But the road is clear. We haven't seen an assassin for days. A clever assassin stays hidden. Avatar must be warned. Our mission is nearly over, Westwind, but now it's time for one final run.

(WOMAN GIGGLES) They're really late now, aren't they, old wizard? Bad magic, isn't it? And if they don't show, you'll know no more than you did before. How true, fairy goddess of the New World! But if they don't show, I think that will tell us something too. Damn it, Avatar! If there's any danger, maybe we should - maybe we should arm our states. - Science and technology? - There's no time for that. Even if we could impress our people with the danger science and technology were outlawed millions of years ago. And we must admit it's been a peaceful world since then. Enough, Wizard! I demand to know what you know or I'll banish you! (FIERCE GROWLING) Banish him? But, Father, who will teach me all the magic I've left to learn? Only Avatar can make me a full-fledged fairy. As you can see, I'm only half there. All right. All right. (♪ PIANO MUSIC PLAYS) I'll tell you if you think you can handle it. What do you know about war, about bombs, that could turn a planet molten and liquid? To think it could start again, ten million years after the final one. Sometimes I get tired of being so old. Sometimes being a wizard is lonely at the top. We're waiting, old, old wizard. You know about my brother. Well, as the years passed, I searched for my brother in vain. He had settled in the dark land of Scortch, where people still died of radiation. (NARRATOR) 'For 5,000 years, Blackwolf studied black arts, 'increasing his wisdom 10,000-fold. 'He built a small following of frog-like creatures, 'but needed more troops for his evil plans. 'He then formed an army whose generals were called up 'from the black shadows of hell. 'Souls who waited for untold eternities for a new leader. 'Blackwolf's tremendous power enslaved... them all to carry out his will. 'Then stories of Blackwolf's armies 'attacking neighbouring countries came back. 'Demons of hell armed with black magic. 'But they would get bored or... sidetracked in the middle of battle, 'and give up, running home.' (SCREAMING AND SHOUTING) (WEAPONS CLASHING) Fritz! Fritz, get up, for God's sake! Get up!

Those lousy, stinking, yellow fairies! Those horrible, atrocity-filled vermin! Take this! Take that! They killed Fritz! (NARRATOR) 'They could easily have won, 'but they lacked the motivation and inspiration. 'Blackwolf knew he needed more. 'He sent his huge armies out ' to excavate ancient ruins for links to the past. 'Tales reached Avatar that bits and pieces of pre-holocaust technology 'were being dug up and marched back to Scortch I. 'With these ancient pieces, he built a new war machine. 'Still, his generals needed more to fight with. 'This drove Blackwolf mad with frustration. 'Then one day, that frustration vanished' I sent my elf spies to find out what was happening. I'm sure he has found some great power that will control his armies. You mean, you sent out that elf envoy to investigate based on a vague feeling of your...

Four more. It's not important! The main exterminations are complete. The remaining countries are now ruled by second-rate incompetents, so confused that even now they blame the killings on those within their own ranks. It's time to strike! Sieg heil.

Now, this here is Elinore, Queen of Montagar. What brings you here? (AVATAR) We're on a quest to the land of Scortch. (SEAN) You're heading for Scortch? You're in for trouble. (AVATAR) Will you tell us what you know? Steady, Westwind. We'll eat alone, lest we sit with fools. Meecher, where's Peace? - Arise, you fools! - Hey, what's that? Assassin! Technology! (SCREAMING) By the soul of Dulac and Rackham! - Elinore is gone! - It was Peace! I knew we should've killed him when we had the chance! Never mind. We must find Elinore. The fairies have taken her into the mountain. Hey, there's no time to waste. No one's ever been to the fairy sanctuary before. - It's forbidden to all. - Drums. It begins.

She allowed technology and death into the Golden Circle. - She is a traitor. - Traitor? You fools, release me. Stay back! As the king's guards, we can't allow... you near until the king has ruled. (GIGGLES) No one rules over Elinore of Montagar. (FAIRY) We rule! We rule over death, lies and deceit. We rule. She's emoting. I feel her pain. It hurts! It hurts! Wow! Avatar never told me I had full fairy powers. Ha! He said I wasn't ready yet. I told you, she's dangerous. Destroy her while there's still time. I say destroy her, king's rule or not. Now why'd you want to go and do that for, love? It's hard enough controlling them as it is. Release me, or I, Elinore, shall show all you ants something. (ROARING) - Stop him, Miss. Stop him! - Oh, did I do that? Stop! I command you to cease. Okay. Leave everyone alone. I say, Miss, you better stop him. I think it'd be better if you released me and we all ran away. (GROWLING) Kill! Kill! Kill! Holy chrome. Elinore's really gone and done it. It's all a disaster. Well, old man, what are you going to do about it? You better hurry up, Miss. Avatar the Great... coming! Avatar! Yeah. You can kill me now, I'm sure. I've given myself to you. - I make no attempt to save myself. - Save yourself? Save yourself? Save me! I can't, Elinore. The only one who could might be the king here. My mission, O Lord, is to save the world from another holocaust. Sean was killed not by us, but by my brother's assassins, who have been sent to kill Weehawk, Elinore, Peace and myself before we reach Scortch. For all I know and fear, Weehawk is dead. So might be Peace. I ask for permission to take the girl and myself to try to... complete our mission alone though it does seem doomed now. I will not allow you to hurt Elinore without a fight by myself. My brother lies, my good King! Avatar! Avatar! What will it be, King? Time's getting short. Avatar, could you hurry up a little bit? We have been sent death, images and humans each with a different story. Something happening here. Not you, please. Oh, no. I have always been very good and could even be better sometimes. It starts again, the only act that has been real so far is the fact that Avatar did not break his word. When the arrow struck him, he did not fight back. And from what we all heard about Avatar's power, that is surely the sign of truth. We will neither join nor hinder nor help these two. We will wait and see. That is our decision. (BELLOWS) Well, we're out of there. Ouch! Thanks. I forgot about that. - Let me help you. - No, no, no, no. Let me help you. How's that? It's very pretty, Avatar. Yeah, well, it could be warmer. We might as well begin. This is the way, I think. Scortch lies somewhere over these mountains. (AVATAR) Well, good morning. Cosy morning, huh? Avatar, we're trapped. It's nothing a little hard work won't cure. Here. Follow me, Snow Queen. (ELINORE) I'm so cold, so cold. Is it much farther? Elinore, we've rested long enough. We'd better move on. Just a little while longer, Avatar. I'm so tired. Well, okay. I'll go over and see if I can see a pass or a path... or a house or something. Oh, my God. They're our own tracks. We've been moving in circles. I better not tell Elinore. It'll do her no good. Avatar, riders! Run! Assassins come to finish the job! We'll cut their throats. Let them come. Right. I'll zap them back to Scortch. (HORSES NEIGHING) They split up. Going to come at us from each end. Avatar, we really tried, didn't we? Yes, Elinore. That's all anyone really could've done. Steady. Here they come. Braxis plaxis traxis! Montagar forever. (HORSES APPROACHING) Death, assassins! Peace! Peace, we found them! We found them! What took you so long? Quickly, Peace. Quickly. Let's get them off this glacier. The quest is saved. (NARRATOR) 'The night was spent in the protection of a cave. 'Elinore and Weehawk slept as Avatar counselled with Peace 'on the quickest route to Scortch. 'The journey took them past the ruins of ancient civilizations. 'Strange beasts lurked about, 'but the dangerous mutants that lived there were gone, 'gone to Blackwolf's army.

Well, we got them from old Blackwolf himself. - You mean you joined with...? - Ha-ha! No, no. We ambushed a wolf patrol, took everything except their women, and two days from now, we attack Scortch I. What do you mean, attack? The remaining elves of the free world have joined under my banner. That banner will be carried to Scortch I. Join us, old wizard. We desperately need you. (ANGRY MUTTERING) (COCKS WEAPON) Is this how you're repaying' me? Stand back. Avatar will not be touched. When our world was young, so was mighty Avatar. Misty moons ago, he strode this planet like a messiah, curing radiation sickness from man and bird, cleaning the planet of its filth. It was Avatar who fought alongside my father against the first mutant attack. So now we have our messiah back again. He's going to destroy his brother for us. With what? A woman-child... one elf... and a moron robot. Oh, Avatar. (WOMAN SCREAMS) - What is it? - It's Blackwolf. He's trying to gain control. Back! Back! Back to hell! You can't have him! You did it. You beat the demon. - What's happened? - Erm... Well, I suddenly felt very sorry for Peace, so I went... over to him and took his hand and I tried to comfort him. Peace is in constant mental battle with Blackwolf. Your kind words took his mind off the battle. It allowed Blackwolf his chance. Avatar. What's that? Trapped. (SQUAWKING) - Jump, Peace! - Jump, Peace! (AVATAR) Elinore! Elinore! Ah, I don't know. I just don't know. I don't know what happened to Elinore. Betrayal of Elinore to the quest has broken his heart. There is nothing wrong with him. Tomorrow morning, the attack begins. Avatar, we have to go now. The cliffs of Scortch can be seen. We have to go now to complete our mission. Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - How? - We have to swim in. Oh. Okay. (AVATAR) What's happened to the world? I don't know. I can remember back... All the fairies were so good... We're here. Scortch. Chrome! Come. We'll walk right up the road and no one will expect it. - We'll act like slaves. - Yeah. The castle. I see it. It's quite a distance. I had one where the whole country would disappear for a day. Oh... Ha! That was, uh... That was really, er... I just don't know. Over there. That must be the entrance to the lower cities. Guards might be about. Come on. Hmm. How ugly. How ugly. Kapow! Boom! (SIGHS HEAVILY) (HITLER SPEAKING GERMAN OVER LOUDSPEAKER) I just don't know. Maybe... maybe I should make a deal with them. (SINGING IN GERMAN) Chrome. Which way? I don't know. You know, I should've stayed with them. - They love magic. - Shh! - Avatar, just stay quiet. - Oh. Psst. Hey, General. Want to buy an elf hat? Elf beard? Souvenirs for sale. Precious souvenirs for sale. - Get them while they're still hot. - No more wars, you fools! Love! Scortch can be beautiful too. Look, look. Real, beautiful presents. Ha-ha! Now, that... that is a wonderful trick. - Wonderful. - It's Avatar. Oh, General. It's him. It's bad. It's come to hurt the Führer. Kill it. Oh, master, kill it. Ha-ha! That's impossible. That dirty old man is Avatar the Great? Ha-ha! If that is so then I am a warthog's uncle! Funny you should say that. (SCREAMS) Kiyah! Ki-yah! Oooowah! (SCREAMS) The enemy is dead. Oh, master, the enemy is dead. My God! What have I done? Master loves Larry. Master feeds Larry. What are elves good for? Avatar, good luck! The beast has shown us the way to the castle.

Don't! Don't! Stop, elf! Blood on blood flowing, fathers and sons dying, brothers and... lovers spilling false hate and rivers of life flowing away. Fool elf! Think your sword is always quick, but what else? Think! Weehawk, I could not help it. When I touched Peace in the desert, Blackwolf trapped my mind. I'm not as strong as Peace. It hurts. (SOBBING) Avatar must know. The trouble with you, my brother, is... that you've always been too good. Well, that may be. But I still think I look more like Ma than you do. You know, uh, lots of character. I'm aging' better. Brother, there is no need for me to destroy you. Surrender. Surrender your world. You always did need an audience, you sap. Let me tell ya, I ain't practised much magic for a long time. I wanna show you a trick Mother showed me when you weren't around, to use on special occasions like this. Ah. Oh, yeah, one more thing... I'm glad you changed your last name, you son of a bitch. (GROANING) Avatar! Elinore's no traitor! She was possessed by Blackwolf. (WEEHAWK) It is done! It is done! The world is free! (NARRATOR) 'The projector destroyed, the battle was over. 'Shadow creatures froze in their tracks. 'Some faded... 'some crawled back to hell. 'Mutants, leaderless, ran. 'Elves swept the beaches clear 'of the few remaining mutants that still fought... (CROWS CAWING) 'as hundreds of circling black birds... screamed at the carnage below. 'There was some rejoicing. 'But mostly, everyone wished to return home quickly 'to tell their loved ones that the war was won, 'Hitler was dead again, 'and that they could live once more in peace 'in the land they loved so much. 'God-given. Amen.' Avatar! Look what I caught! Don't hurt Larry. Larry served. Beast of a thousand scales! Hey, hey, hey. Set it free. It's harmless without Blackwolf. Pity it. It's not its fault. Mmm. So be it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, master. We ride back to Montagar. Weehawk, you ride back to Montagar alone. Avatar and I will start a new kingdom somewhere. You will rule Montagar as their new king. Are you and Avatar married, my Queen? Hey, kid, take it easy, huh? You did a good job, but don't get carried away. You think Avatar's too old to get married? Weehawk, how many years do wizards live, 10,000 or more? And I got at least a thousand left, you know what I mean? Forgive me, Avatar. Forgive me, both of you. For Montagar, forever. (NEIGHING) Well, come on. Let's make it. Avatar... (GIGGLES) You're getting older and much bolder. Come on! I meant let's make it out of here.
