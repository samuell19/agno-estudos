it's surprising do i look like a ramen shop owner? i have a simple request please let haru-chan know that he doesn't need to send money anymore... he's been sending you money? $30 or $50 at a time he even sent $9 once he has a payment system from his account... and he's been sending money ever since when i called his work place they told me he'd quit what did he do? he use to work for a pharmaceutical company he was in charge of attaining consent from patients to gather their blood at hospitals i worked at one of the hospitals and met him one day sometime afterwards, we married tada san i'm not sure what a ramen shop owner should look like what is it? a stalker is looking this way i know that face - let's irritate him - don't he's really creepy! wanna spend the day together? wanna get hitched? i wanted to have a child i wasn't getting younger i wasn't too busy... i thought this is my last chance tada san this child was conceived thru artificial insemination huh?

yamashita is really dangerous if he gets caught for doing something at least you'll be safe why? why're you doing this? if something happens to you, the chihuahua will be alone with lulu if that happens, shin-chans white powder may get into the dogs food then i'll get in trouble with tada here, shumai lunch box hey come with me handyman, where's your friend?

it messed with my mind! she said it was my child even if it wasn't, i was fine with it thinking that way... i really began to think it was my child so, i refused the test if by chance... the child wasn't mine... really, if that was the case what the hell was i suppose to do? i... i loved the newborn without any conditions this child is mine i'm fine with it i prayed my feelings wouldn't change but... the baby died suddenly a fever started one night i was looking after the baby... i didn't mean to fall asleep... when i woke the baby was cold... after six month, we separated you must've heard it many times... but i'll say it again it wasn't your fault touch my pinky it's all better now, isn't it?
