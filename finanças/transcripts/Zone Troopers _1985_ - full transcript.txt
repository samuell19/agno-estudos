[In the Moodplaying] [Mittens] Joey! -Hey, Joey! -What gives, Mittens? I'm reading here. You still got that book with them blonde dames from space? -Pirate Women of Venus? -That's the one. Sorry, pal. Swapped it to a guy in G-squad. For a pack of Luckies. Nuts! It had a swell cover. Say, Verona, you don't smoke. How about them Luckies? Thought you'd never ask. That's gonna cost you every candy bar you got. All of 'em? Smell that fine Virginia tobacco? Hand 'em over. [distant explosions] -How's that ankle, Philips? -[gasps in pain] This cold ain't doing it no good. What I really need out here is a nurse. Yeah, me too, doc. Me too. Snowman to Scotty one! Snowman to Scotty one! [radio frequency humming] Scotty, where the hell are you? I still can't reach him, Sarge. All I get is this junk. I tell you, it's weird. I've never heard anything like it. [radio frequency humming] Keep trying. Snowman to Scotty one, do you read me? [Sarge] Ferguson, let me see your compass. Sure. [pinging] Thanks. Hey, Sarge, how long are we gonna stay here? [in German accent] Forward, march! Hey, boys! Hold it just like that. [shutter clicks] Perfect! [distant explosions] Who the hell are you? Yeah, where'd you come from? I hooked up with your outfit this morning. Charlie Dolan. The Charlie Dolan? Afraid so. He's the writer guy. All the big papers print his stuff. Yeah, I know. Corporal Mattinski. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Jeez, Mr. Dolan. You gonna do a story on us? Something like that, son. [exhales] [Dolan] Hey, corporal. Mind if I bum a smoke from you? Thank you. Say, is that the Zippo General Patton give ya? -Sure is. -Wow! Thanks for the smoke. See you later. Say, Mr. Dolan. You didn't get the name. PFC, Joseph Verona. Fort Lee, New Jersey. Okay, Joey, you got it. Take it easy. Son of Angelo and Rose Verona. [distant explosion] Hey, Sergeant Stone. Charlie Dolan. Yeah, I know. How about that interview, huh? Later! -Butt me, Mittens. -Sure, Sarge. So, how are we doing? [soldier] Hey, Mittens, you got cigarettes? [Sarge] Sir, I don't think we can hold off the other squads any longer. I think they're lost. What's more, the radio's not working. Something's not right. I say we walk now, Lieutenant. Listen up, Sergeant. I've been taking your guff all morning long. I'm in charge here and it's high time you started listening to me. [soldiers approaching] There. There, you see? There they are, now. Lieutenant, I wouldn't... Damn green kid. -[gunshots] -[screaming] Take cover! [guns firing] [shouting indistinctly] [screams] [indistinct shouting] Pull out! [indistinct shouting] Red Cross! Red corps. [soldier screaming] [gunshots] More coming. -We gotta get out of here. -Joey, 10 o'clock! Matin! Make for the woods! Let's go! Come on! [Joey] Sarge! They got the sarge. No, look! [grunts] What are you waiting for? More krauts? Where are the rest of our guys? We're it! Move! Okay, I think we're in the clear. Boy, Sarge, I crossed you off that time. I guess it's true. Nothing seems to kill the Iron Sarge. What'd I say? I don't wanna hear that ration of bull from you or anybody. You know what saved my neck? This. Helmet. Steel. GI, Olive Drab. Government issue. Nothing else. Not luck. Not magic, not my guardian angel. Understood? Gentlemen, move out. Mittens, point. [Mittens] The radio bought it with Ferguson, Sarge. [Sarge] Did you check it out? Made sure it couldn't be salvaged? No, sir. I did not. Damn it, Mittens. What the hell were you thinking about? I was thinking of my pals laying dead back there. I was thinking of you turning down that battlefield commission. If you had been in charge, instead of that baby-faced lieutenant, we would've never gotten ambushed. So, that's how you figure it? That's how I figure it. What commission was that? What the hell are you doing? Taking notes. Ah, that's swell. Say, fellas, how much farther are we gonna hike? My dogs are screaming. Damnedest thing I ever saw. Compass won't settle. Probably some new kraut secret weapon. Magnetic ray, perhaps? Get a load of Buck Rogers. Could be an iron ore deposit. Where do you figure we are, Sergeant? I don't know. Somewhere behind enemy lines. You know, it's funny. You know, these woods. We could just easily be in Illinois. Yeah, till you get popped by a sniper. Sniper? No! [Dolan] We're in too deep! [grunting] Ain't nothing out here but us and the bears. Fire! Mortar! [explosion] [zapping] What happened? Could have been lightning, huh? Weird. [speaking German] [bomb whistling] [Dolan] Wife and kid? [Mittens] They were once. How long's it been since you've seen 'em? Two years. Only family I got now are Sarge and Joey. What about you? Got a girl? No. Too hard to keep 'em in my line of work. It's getting so I can't remember what a woman looks like. Well, I can. And that's worse. [chuckling] So, you've been with the sarge since North Africa, huh? Algeria, yeah. You think he can get us out of this mess? If anyone can, it's the sarge. Well, I don't want to raise any hackles around here, but he ain't the friendliest guy I've ever met. Sarge doesn't try to make friends because he doesn't like losing them. Thanks. [Dolan] Who's Velma? You ask a lot of questions, mister. I'm a reporter, mister. Is she the wife? Velma was a girl from the neighborhood. She beat the crap out of Mittens in the first grade. Is that true? [laughing] [gun cocking] If I was a kraut, you'd all be dead. Less mouth, more ears. Verona, watch. Yes, sir. [humming "In the Mood"] [gurgling] Mittens? I know it's you. Now, cut it out. Big lummox. [grass rustling] Mittens! You starting to get my goat. [owl hooting] [gurgling] [shouts ] What is it? It's nothing, I just thought I'd... Then back to your post! Sure, I just gotta do something first. Damn, it's cold. Sun will be up soon. Have some coffee, son. Thanks. Mr. Dolan, have you seen many guys crack up? You know... Battle fatigue, shell-shock. Too many. Last night, I could've sworn I saw something. Something weird. Go on. There was this man in the dark. Well... Not exactly a man. More like a... Like a monster. These big eyes and this great big, hairy head. And there was this sticky egg, see. Only, when I went back to go look for it, it was gone. I'm going crackers. Mr. Dolan, I'm going crackers, ain't I? [chuckling] Hell, no, son. You probably saw a moose or something. A moose, yeah, sure. That's right, a moose. It was pretty dark. And I don't feel crazy. Of course not. Listen, this is a new one on me too. Getting stuck behind kraut lines like this. Hell, even the sarge himself is sweating it. He only went to sleep a few minutes ago. Been up all night. You're up, Dolan. [grunts] Okay. I saw a deer. Boy, what I wouldn't give for a fresh piece of meat. So, let's bag it. [Mittens] Nah. Can't go shooting' up the woods. Nobody can trace one shot. You can drop a deer with one shot? Hey, back home they call me, "Bull's-eye Dolan." Where'd you spot him, Mittens? Let me check with the sarge first. No, wait. Let him sleep. Come on, he just got to sleep. He's not gonna complain about a steak breakfast. Okay, one shot. That's the limit. Mittens, I don't know about this. It was right here. Standing in the moonlight. A statue, like he was king of the forest or something. -[panting] -He was taking a dump. Look, he had something to eat right here. He headed off right across that way. Probably towards water. What are you, part Indian? Yeah. My uncle's Mahatma Gandhi. Wise guy. [Joey] Okay, that's two men on, two out, bottom of the ninth. Stan the man, it's up to you, or the cards are sunk. It's the wind-up, the pitch. [exclaims] Home run! The crowd goes wild! [imitating crowd cheering] You know, kid. I've seen a lot of screwballs come through my outfit, you take the cake, Verona. Gee whiz, Sarge. How else am I gonna get to see the World Series. What time is it? You should have woke me. Dolan said not to. "Dolan said." "Dolan said?" Where is that pencil pusher? He went hunting. Hunting what, soldier? Deer. Mittens seen a deer. Let me get this straight. We're ten miles behind German lines, and Mittens and Dolan are on safari? What's next? Schnapps at Il Duce's hunting lodge? Saddle up. Now! Yes, sir. Son of a bitch! Get that! Do you hear something? Yeah, it's coming from over there. Holy smokes! [gun cocks] [Dolan] Now, what the hell are the SS doing out here? Who cares? Let's beat it. Wait a minute. Wait. The camp's deserted. Where's the rest of them? Looking for us. Come on! No, no. Wait. That's impossible. This is the kraut elite. These are the big boys. They don't mess around with common joes like us. No, that's... Something big is up down there. -Maneuvers. -Maneuvers? Ten miles from the front? I don't buy that. Neither do you. Come on. Let's get a closer look. No. It's deserted, Mittens. Listen, Dolan. I went along with your stupid deer hunt, but this is where I draw the line. I am not marching into no SS camp so you can scoop a story, got it? All right, Corporal. I'm crazy, I'm nuts! I'm sorry! All right, come on. -Wait a minute. -What now? [bell clanking] I'd like to take a leak. Okay, but shake it up, will you? You got it. Damn it! Mittens should have known better. Dolan talked him into it, Sarge. Maybe they got lost. Boy, it'd be easy enough out here. This place gives me the willies. All them big, creepy trees. Like a fairy tale or something. Come on. I'll tell you one thing, they don't show up by sundown, you and I head back, alone. You can't just write Mittens off like that. What if he's in trouble? Joey, you okay? Yeah, yeah. But, what's that thing? I don't know. Looks like it was burned. [gasps] What, is it hot? No. Cold. So cold, it hurt. Funny-looking gizmo. Part of an engine, maybe? I don't know. But I don't like it. Come on! Double-time it, Dolan. [sighs] Dolan! Son of a bitch. [radio whirring] [both speaking German] What the hell is this? Some kind of Nazi secret weapon? [whispers] My God. Hey, Sarge. There's more of this junk all over the place. And the tops of them trees look like something smacked right through 'em. Verona, I got better things to worry about than some damn plane crash. I lost my entire squad out here and I don't even know where here is. Well, how's about I take a hike up that hill, take a look, see what I can see, huh? [sighs] Yeah, you do that. Sarge! You better come up here! Quick! I really think you should see this! I really do. What is it? Jesus Christ. [projector whirring] [shouting in German] [speaking German] [gunshots] You're one dumb lug. -Move out. -[motorcycle approaching] -What about this stuff? -Leave 'em, damn it! Come on! Uh-oh! [speaking German] [screams] [groaning] Hey! [engine humming] Jeez, it must have been huge. What do you think? Some kind of new zeppelin? [Sarge] I don't know. I've never seen markings like those. [Joey] Probably some kraut secret weapon. It could be ours. Or it might be... Might be what, Joey? Nothing, nothing. Best way to find out is to get inside. There's gotta be some way to get this open. [grunting] Gosh! Stand back! This thing's still ticking. There might be survivors. [engine humming] [Sarge] Like a steam bath in here! [Joey] Sounds like pistons. We must be over the engine. Hey, there's a door up ahead. Watch your step, Joey! Ah, it'll hold us. [Joey yells] [Sarge] Hang on! Hang on, Joey! Hang on, kid. [grunting] Thanks, Sarge! We're getting out! But we just got here. We gotta take a look around. [shouting] Who do you suppose built this getup? I don't know, but it wasn't the Army Air Corps! Take a look at it! It's humming like an engine! [engine humming] Listen, I say, we bail out of here! -She could blow any minute! -Come on, Sarge! Where's your sense of adventure? [Joey screams] Joey! Joey, you okay? Yeah, just a sec. [gasps] Sarge! Jesus, what's that smell? It's him. Him, who? My God. What is it? He looks just like the guy I saw last night on watch. I thought I was nuts. I was afraid to tell you. Don't you see, Sarge? We're on a rocket ship or something from Mars. Mars, nothing. Get with it, Joey. It's some kind of animal. Crazy Nazi experiment. They're doing it all the time. Incredible, we gotta get a light on here or something. Don't touch anything. -Don't touch-- -[whirs] That's swell, Verona. At least I got the lights on. Look, this chair's empty, right? That's the co-pilot running around out there in the woods. Look like re-con photos. Huh. These guys must be taking pictures. That stiff is making me sick! -We gotta get this door open. -Leave it to me. No, no! Don't do anything. You've done enough damage. Stand back. Some kind of periscope, maybe? It wasn't made for a human head, Sarge. See anything? Yeah. -The colors are all screwy. -[whirring] What's going on? -[Joey] Let me have a look. -No, I see, hold it! -Krauts! -[beeping] Lousy, stinking krauts! [speaking German] It's no use. I've tried every button and switch there is. [camera whirring] [speaking German] They're inside. [soldiers chattering] [indistinct chatter] Sounds like there's 50 of them out there. [gun cocking] We got plenty ammo. Come on, Verona. Think like a Martian. There's got to be an escape hatch around here somewhere. That stupid thing. [whooshes] I feel fresh air. It's a vent. [screaming] [speaking German] [conversing in German] [speaking German] [replying in German] Sarge, that kraut on the bike. Not now, Verona. We gotta figure a way to blow this ship. Are you crazy? I know you don't believe it, but I'm dead sure this is a rocket ship from outer space. You're out of line, soldier. Maybe so. But if I'm right, this is big. Bigger than the whole war. Think of it. Another planet. Another civilization. Listen! If the krauts want this thing, it goes. That's our job. That's our duty. Yes, sir. I figure we drop a pineapple in that tailpipe. Shake that engine up real good. We gotta move now while they're bottled up inside. Let's go! Let it fly, kid! [grenade clanking] [all screaming] [Joey] Sarge, the krauts that got away had Dolan's lighter. Maybe they did get Mittens and Dolan. If we're lucky, that bike will cut a path through the woods so we can follow. Come on, Joey. [conversing in German] [dogs barking] [conversing n German] [alien gurgling] [Dolan] Hey, Fritz, Fritz. What's all the commotion going on out there? Huh? What is it? [shouts] The big airship you guys shot down? We're hip to you! Can it, Dolan. You're not gonna stop until you get us both killed, are you? [sighs] Au contraire, my thick-knuckled corporal. The way I figure it is, if the Germans think we know something they don't, maybe they'll keep us alive. For how long? Well, who cares? As long as we're not dead. Hey, Hans! Hans! It's colder than a penguin's ass out here. How about a couple of blankets? Drop it, will you? Let's get some shut-eye. I can't sleep in this cage, Mitts. Yeah? Well, the way I see it... [grunts] If I'm sleeping, I ain't here. Well, I have to keep talking to stay warm. Besides, my arm's killing me. Hey, Hans. Under the terms of the Geneva Convention, you are required to treat prisoners of war by giving them warm food, adequate shelter and everything else That goes along with that convention. -Do you... -[blowing smoke] You're off my Christmas list, pal. I mean that. [shouting in German] -What's going on? -Get out! I am Colonel Manheim. You will be questioned, now. -[speaking german] -Wait. Wait a minute, wait! I'm an American correspondent. A civilian journalist. [speaking German] You can't do this to me, don't you... Mattinski, George R. Corporal, United States Army. Jesus! You ain't nothing, kraut-head. [grunts] [chuckles] Is that all you got? [grunts] Stop it, damn it! I'll talk. Now, you're showing reason. What do you know about the rocket, and where are the rest of your soldiers? Don't be a sap. -I can take it. -[Manheim] Well? Dolan, Charles Francis. Civilian correspondent, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, USA. Serial number C19717139. Francis? [laughing] [man speaking German] Mittens? Mittens? [speaking German] [gurgling] [conversing in German] Come, come, up! What are you gonna do with me? [shouting in German] In God's name, what the hell is that? What do you know about this? What, are you nuts? I don't know nothing about this. [grunting] You have never seen the creature before? Not a chance, pal. Believe me, I'd remember. You are lying. This is only becoming more difficult, Mr. Dolan. [speaking German] [gurgling] [speaking German] I'm not lying. I'm not lying! [conversing in German] -[whispers] DeinFuehrer. -[replies in German] Heil,Hitler. [Hitler speaking German] Heil,Hitler. [Hitler speaking German] [soldier replying in German] [Hitler speaking German] [speaking German] [all laughing] Pinch me, Dolan. Did I just KO Hitler? You sure did, champ. Too bad we won't live to tell about it. [speaking German] [gurgling] [speaking German] [dogs barking] Hey, Hans! Shut these dogs up, will ya? I need my beauty sleep. Shh! Verona, how'd you get here? Where's the sergeant? Don't talk, just listen. Me and the Sarge got a plan. We're busting you out. They had this bug-head guy in there. A spaceman, too. Hey, Joey. Mittens! You okay? In the pink. I decked Hitler. That bad, huh? Nix, here comes that fat kraut. Damn. [speaking German] Ja, ja. [speaking German] Uh, ja, ja. [replies in German] -Ja. -[shouts in German] [laughs] Ja. [screaming] The jig's up! We gotta make for the truck. Dolan! [speaking German] Heil,Hitler. [whistle blowing] [shouting in German] [speaking German] Mittens, now! [engine sputtering] [engine revving] Hang on! [yelling in German] [screaming] [screams] I got a present for you. Velma! So long, Fritz. [screaming] [grunting] Duck! [engine sputtering] [pulsating] Gosh, thanks. [speaking German] Yank the distributor cap. We'll leave the krauts a nice roadblock. What's up, Sarge? We gotta ditch the truck. We'll never make it past that checkpoint. -Where are we? -We're almost home. Ever since we blew that ship, the compass has been working. Dolan, you'll need this. Mittens, Dolan. Joey! All right, Mac, you're coming with us. [gurgling] What's that face mean? Why, it's one of them tombs my grandfather told me about. They're all over Italy. Great, we'll hole up here for the night. Dolan, Bug. [gurgles] What's eating you? Nothing. I got respect for the dead, that's all. Ain't no stiffs in there, Mittens, the robbers cleaned them out years ago. [birds chirping and hooting] [wolves howling] [Mittens] Why doesn't he do anything? [alien gurgling] What would you like him to do, Mittens, beg for peanuts? No, he just sits there, that's all. Yeah. [exhales] [sighs] What a story. I'd give a million bucks to know what's going on inside that noodle of his. [Dolan exhales] Maybe nothing, maybe he's sleeping. [Joey] Hey, you guys, quit crowding him. -So, you find the packs okay? -Yeah, right where we left 'em. How's he doing? Who can tell? Joey, break out the rations. Yeah, I'm starving. [whistles] Dolan, let's take a walk. What for? Joey, what'll it be? Goulash or SOS? Both, we got company. [gurgling] Hey, Joey, where do you think he's from? Venus, maybe? Get smart, Mittens. Anybody knows there's no life on Venus. He's got to be from Mars. Mars. What's on your mind? This whole stinking mess and where you fit in. -I don't get you. -Then I'll spell it out for you. Two days ago, command drops you in my lap. No reason given. Next thing I know, I got a half a spaceship, a six-foot-tall grasshopper and the kraut elite on my butt. I know, it's crazy, ain't it? Cough it up, news hound. Who sent you? Army intelligence? OSS? Ike knows about this. Roosevelt, too, right? Boy, are you off the beam. Sure, I had command keep you in the dark, but I came here to write about you. The Iron Sarge. -What? -It's true, Stone. Whether you like it or not, you're becoming a legend with all these GI's. I've heard you've been killed a dozen times but you always come back. Unless you want your name printed on a pack of lies, you've got nothing to print, Dolan. I'm just another dog-face fighting this lousy war. The boss says, "Come home." Come on, Dolan, let's head back. What's all this crud about Mittens decking Hitler? He really did. You should've seen it. [gurgling] No dice in the lima beans. Hell, Joey, even we don't eat those. He drank some water at least. Anything else in the pack? Nope. Wait a minute. [alien gurgling] It's my lucky day. Hey, what the... He's eating it? He's eating it. He likes tobacco. -Give him another one. -Forget it. Don't be stingy, Mittens. What is that? He wants to swap. [gurgling] Hey, wait a minute. [whirring] Joey, you okay? Look. Hello, soldier. I'm dreaming. I don't think so. Gosh. Hi. Lay off, lunkhead. You're cramping my style. I'm on a roll. Hand it over. Let's see if we can get a blonde in here. [pulsates] Now, you've done it, you big ox! Why, for two cents, I'll... [Joey] Holy... Easy, Bug. [gurgling] It was an accident. I think he's talking. Don't shoot, Sarge, he's trying to tell us something. [gurgling] What's he saying? Maybe that he's a soldier from outer space. It gives me all the more reason to tie him up. You can't do that. He's not an animal. He's an intelligent being! He just showed us that. Listen, Joey. It's for his own good. If he runs off again, the krauts could grab him. Look, he's scared. Sure, he's scared. [gurgling] A million miles from home. Lost in a strange land, doesn't speak the language. People trying to kill him. Sound familiar? [shivering] [gurgling] What are you looking at? [sighs] [Joey] Guess he makes those eggs to sleep in. Looks like he chewed right through it. Charlie, you were on watch. Didn't you see anything? [sighs] Sorry. All right, gear up. We're gonna have to go after him. Which way? Let's say northeast, toward his rocket ship. Yeah, he doesn't know you blew it up. [Joey] He couldn't have gotten too far. [Sarge] Hold it. What the hell is that? Stand back. It's like something out of the World's Fair. [guns cocking] [gurgling] Come on. [pulsates] Wow! [gurgling] Now, just what in the hell army are you people with, huh? They're from outer space. It's obvious. Joseph Verona, planet Earth. Pleased to meet you. The name's Mattinski, but call me Mitten. Mittens, Joey, as you were, damn it. How do we know this ain't some kraut trick, huh? [machine whirring] That gizmo in his ear must be a translator. Where are you people from? [Mittens] Wait a minute. Wait, my God, I've got a million questions. What's it like up there? How do them ray guns work? Do you have any women with you, like blondes from Venus, maybe? The Thrachian is a female. Jeez. We never thought of that. [gurgling] You're welcome, sir. [chuckles] Ma'am. [gurgling] Then, it's so long, suckers, right? My men risked their butts for Jiminy Cricket here and you just take off? Return the favor, damn it. Help us get back to our lines. Your little visit has cut the whole Kraut army loose in these woods. -[vehicles approaching] -Sarge! Take cover, guys! Verona! Get down! Get down! You gotta get out of the way! Come on! [gurgling] [pulsates] Jesus. Mittens! They got Joey! Oh! You'll be okay, Joey. We'll get you home. Mr. Dolan. I'm right here, kid. Never got that interview, did we, boy? You're gonna write about all this, ain't you? Sure, kid. Sure. So, the guys at home will know... Joey Verona met the men from space. [shivering] Shouldn't we say a prayer or something? No, it's too late for that. You'd think with all they must know, them rocket guys could've done something for Joey. [sighs] [Dolan] Sergeant, sergeant. Kraut platoon strike coming in from the southwest. Move. Hey, put your radio in your ear. [machine whirring] Radio in your ear. The enemy is on their way and they're looking for you. Listen, I figured the eight of us can catch them in the meadow with those fancy ray guns... We will not help you kill your own kind. The Nazis ain't our kind, pal. Forget it, Mittens. We'll just have to reach that meadow by ourselves. Just the three of us? It's like I told Joey. If the Krauts want something, it's our job to keep them from it. Mittens, Charlie. [machines whirring] [gurgling] [soldiers chattering indistinctly] What do you think they'll do now, Sergeant? Throw a squad in our face and another one on the back end. -How's the ammo? -Last clip. Likewise. What about grenades? One, and I'm saving it. Listen, we got to hold those krauts till that rocket takes off. [speaking German] -I'm dry. -Me too. Now, what? [speaking German] My men are out of ammo! I wanna talk surrender with your commanding officer! [speaking German] [sighs] I'd as soon kill you and be done with it. But, if you lead us to the creature, I will give you and your men free passage to your lines. You've got a deal, Fritzy. Let's shake on it. [guns firing] [shouting indistinctly] My God, he really did it. [Dolan] Yeah. He gave us a chance. Let's take it. I ain't leaving without the sarge. There's nothing left, Mittens. [soldiers chattering in German] [guns firing] Tough luck, Dolan. Looks like we've all bought the farm. [lasers firing] Did you see that? -Where'd it come from? -I don't know. [lasers firing] Thanks. Hey, how do you work this thing? Dolan, grab it like this. All right then. Let's show the Hun what this puppy can do. If we had 100 of these pea shooters, our boys would be home by Christmas. I wouldn't start buying that plum pudding yet, pal. No, no, there's too many of them, no. [laughing] That's cooking, bug-head. Yes, sir. [gurgling] So, now it's back to the heavens. [Sarge] Well... Thanks for saving our butts. [gurgling] Thanks, Bug. Dolan. [spaceship whirring] Well, the way I figure it, our lines are right up this road here. Looks like we finally made it. Yep. Listen to me. -Listen, Dolan. you got to write about this. -Yeah. You gotta do it for Sarge and Joey. Well, I've been thinking about that and you know what? What? -I can't do it. -Why not? Because there's not one shred of evidence. I mean, my editor would throw me in the loony bin. If I were you, I'd watch telling that tale about socking Hitler, too. I mean, who's gonna buy that one, huh? Write about it anyway. I don't know. Sell it to one of Joey's crazy magazines. -That's worth a try. -Yeah. -Last one. -[chuckles] Look. What's he doing? He's not shooting. [whistles] Well, I'll be damned. Butt me, Mittens. Gentlemen. Move out.
