POLICE SPECIAL FORCES Is the Bravo Team ready? Bravo Team? Room service. -What gives? -Room service. Camera? Security camera. Come here, you! Reyhan said that Çetin hasn't been home for three days. She said if that's what he's going to do, he can stay at his sister's. -Tekin! -Çetin. -Tekin! -The battery might die soon. EMERGENCY EXIT PLAN The counterfeit money operation pursued for more than two years by the Istanbul Police Department became a disaster overnight. Fire broke out in the raided hotel, leaving the operation up in the air. Tekin Yüksek, who's being held responsible for the collapse of the operation is currently in custody. The hotel's head of security is with us now. I would like to know, was the cause of the fire neglect? Absolutely not! The fire broke out as a result of a commotion caused by an irresponsible person. By the way, our hotel has air-conditioning. In other words, a fire in the hotel isn't possible. Thank you. Tekin Yüksek, the suspect who says he's a detective, is being removed from the hotel and is being taken to the Istanbul police headquarter for questioning. I'm a detective, mate. Why wouldn't you let people know beforehand that you were conducting a secret operation! According to the information we've just received, the suspect -works at Pops Detectives. -Tops, not Pops! -Yes, at Pops Detectives. -Tops! He's now being taken to the police station for questioning. You're watching, aren't you? Adnan, I think we've found our man. He says he's a detective, yet he set the hotel on fire! 1 MONTH LATER... -Look, it's Tops, not Pops! -Shut it! Look here, Tekin from Tops Detectives! If you give the shoddy photos that you shot to my wife, I swear... I'll finish you and your successful career! You got that? Easy, Mahmut! Are you wearing a ring? You're going to bruise my face! Help me up! Please bro, it makes things hard when we hang you upside down like this. No! Everything has to seem real. Whatever happens when a real beating happens. The idea is to appear on TV and clear the company's name. TV has a powerful impact with these sorts of things. -Is the cameraman coming? -Yes. But he'll be here around four or five in the afternoon. So you're chasing me in such a way that the cameraman can see. Then what do I do? I run into a side street. Then we just bash him as we wish. Of course. Everyone takes a hit. -You got the address? -Yes. Down Salih Mehmet Road. Why are you going so far? Why not just beat him here? Mahmut, you won't include him in the operation, will you? -No. -Kenan, what's with your clothes, man? -Don't worry. I've got it under control. -That's exactly what I'm afraid of. KAYA STREET Yes? Wounded Eagle has returned to the nest. -Has the wheat spiked? -Yes. And the fields? They're green. -And the clouds? -They've cleared. Open the door. It's me, Tekin! İsmail? -Yes? -The door! -Good luck with that. -Thanks, mate. -This is a serious firm, man. -What do you think I'm doing, Tekin? That's what I'm asking. What are you doing? Oh, this? This is a driving course thingamajig. They really liked my driving lesson. And now I'll attend first aid classes. -What happened to your cheek? -While you've been doing nothing I was clearing the company's name. Mahmut punched me while we were rehearsing. I'll get you a hardboiled egg to rub on the bruise. Thanks, but no thanks. Tekin my boy, I took first aid lessons for 25 years as a traffic cop. I was the first person to come to mind when first aid was mentioned. -But you play Scrabble in the office. -I win, don't I? The company's name is shattered and look at what you're worried about. Pops Detectives. What a smart name. How quick you are to forget your penis problems! Let's discuss this in the board meeting. Look, I've told you a hundred times not to touch this house, that it's not dry yet. -What's my father's gun doing here? -The sign painter brought it. The sign painter? What? Wasn't he supposed to do this in blue? POLICE Selim dear, don't slam the door. -Here's your tea, Tekin. -What's this? Bro, can we close that tab now? -We're not running away. -Dad has strict orders. "Go tell Pops they haven't paid rent for three months, so they pay for the tea." It's Tops, not Pops! Give it a rest and get me some real tea. -Give me 100 bucks first. -I don't have any change! No worries, man, I'll change it for you. Look, I'm sick of being caught between you. You keep saying no. I go to him and he tells me to go and get it. I can't answer back. -Please, tell me what to do. -You know what you should do? -What, bro? -Just fuck off, man! There's no need for that. -Tekin, come here and give me a hand. -Hold on a minute! Tekin, give me the money. I've got a game to get to. Close the door quietly. Pardon me. Is this Tops Detectives? -Pops madam, Pops. -Shut up İsmail, please! Furthermore, I'd really appreciate you putting away this dummy, İsmail. I can come back another time if you wish. No, of course not. We as Tops Detectives always keep our door open for clients. Won't you take a seat? -Tekin, man. -What? -The money for the tea? -Oh the tea, sure. Withdraw it from this card. -Do you know the code? -No. Place your finger on the machine, it'll give you the money. -But... -I'm in a meeting now. Later. -İsmail, show Selim the door. -Liked the door, Selim? Careful, don't hit your head. Take a seat. Yes, madam. How will I be of service to you? -Can we talk in private? -Would you like me to leave? -I'd like to speak with you? -İsmail. -Tekin. -İsmail. -Tekin. -İsmail. Tekin. -Weren't you leaving, İsmail? -What for? We have work to do. -Yes. Your name? -Suzan. Sezen, how long have your suspected that your husband has been unfaithful to you? -It's Suzan. -Who's Suzan? -I'm Suzan. -Are you Suzan? Yes. Do you think your husband is being unfaithful to you with you? This will harm the marriage. You misunderstood. You said Sezen just before, that's why. I am Suzan. -Who is Sezen? -How should I know? My name is Suzan. Pleased to meet you, madam. -We were talking about your husband. -I don't have one. I'm here for my daughter. -Has she hit the nightclub? -Hold on a minute, jeez! Mr. Tekin... If that's the case, we shouldn't bother. It's shifty business. What nightclub? Maybe she's just out to make some money. Can't she actually just be singing? Does she have a good voice? Look, if the nightclub is involved, then there's something not right about her. If it was about money, she could become a cleaner. Why entertain men at tables? Maybe she isn't entertaining men at their tables! Was your daughter wearing racy costumes lately? Not everyone who ends up in a nightclub entertains men! It depends on the club. Right? There are strip clubs, revues. Am I wrong? They use mouth balls, whips, nipple touch. Stuff like that. Mouth ball? Have you lost your mind? Was she kidnapped? It's the organ mafia, madam. They kidnap girls, take their kidneys and sell them back to nightclub. You're obsessed with the nightclub! How can a girl with just one kidney sing! -Mr. Tekin! -What? She wasn't kidnapped and she hasn't hit the slums. She's just going through a rough time. -Why? -We lost her father. -Then let's find him too. -He's dead. My condolences. At least you know where he is. Isn't that so? So how long has he been dead since he passed away? -About a month. -It's still very new. Have you held a wake yet? She may come for the ceremony. Jeez, how can a dead man go to a wake? Be a little thoughtful, please! I'm very sorry, Suzan. Look, it's a really difficult situation for a girl at this age to lose he father. What's more, Pelin's a sensitive girl. Exactly like İsmail here. You touch him and he's all in tears. I'm a retired traffic cop, madam. Sorry to hear that but Pelin's situation is no joking matter. She's been on her feet for the last month with medication and they've made her really aggressive. She won't see her friends, or me, and she won't come home either. Believe it or not, but I'm curious too now. Where is this girl? I am asking you for help. I'm afraid that something terrible will happen to her. Well I'd be scared if it were me too. There are thieves, molesters and rapists out there. Anything could have happened. Maybe, while we've been sitting here, getting to know each other chatting, they took the girl and locked her up in a studio in a really expensive studio, and they've oiled her up so she looks good. They've made her look like the cover girls on magazines. They're taking erotic pictures of her. See? I'm going to get up tomorrow morning and turn the computer on, enter the erotic site that I'm a member of, and there's your daughter! -So how are we going to find this girl? -I have a number. Then call. I have but I can't go through. The number belongs to a hotel. If you look for her, you might be able to find her. If you do find her, please don't leave her alone. Stay with her, okay? She may leave the hotel today at 12pm. That's the check-out time. Couch bed? The girl's definitely hit the slums. Not couch bed, check out! You know, those hotels with single use toothbrushes. So Suzan, do you have a clothed picture of your daughter with you? Yes. Here. This will do. Okay. I'll find this girl. Beautiful girl. She must be found. Aygül, Tekin and İsmail are the detectives who will find Pelin. -You're number? -There's no need, Aygül. Don't forget, 12pm. I trust you. -Suzan. -Yes? You can trust me. I'm warning you. The girl's definitely in a nightclub. She ran away from home. Crazy gal. I'm going to the driving class. I'm late. İsmail, we'll firstly renew my father's grave. Then we'll have a huge sign made for us. -Tops Detectives with a capital T. -Did you get a down payment? Enough. How much longer do we have to push the cart for five bucks? Just to the top of the hill. You said the same thing just a minute ago. Ok, just hand over the money. I swear it's just a loan. What loan, man? You already have two servings from last week. And now the one İsmail ate, that makes three. I'm just earning pocket money, man. You have a point too. You have a point. What have you done! -Hello. -What's the situation? Adnan, they are taking action. Very well. Get the minibus ready. So what did I just say? -Don't piss me off. -Wrong. You are not to piss me off! -You should not piss me off. -Bravo. He uses too much salt, it's unhealthy. So are we going to dally around like this? Faster! Dial one then dial five. Let's just go there, man. -Where are we going? -To the hotel. Give me the keys. I'll drive. -What keys? -The car keys. -I can't, I have a class. -You call that an excuse? He who pays the piper calls the tune. Hello, the late Nuri Yüksek. Use my father's phrases whenever you're lost for words. No one takes me seriously. No one takes anyone seriously for nothing. You have to earn it. So I haven't earned it? You sold your father's prized gun just to have a sign made! Just as collateral. And that sign is our face! -Fuck your face! -Stealing his words again! This may be a turning point for us. You won't be going back with this car. I'm going to class. -Please, man. -No. -I need it. -You're not getting it. -I will! -Over my dead body! DRIVER CANDIDATE Lady, come, come! Caps for the twins. Look! Lady! Jennifer wears one of these too. She was on TV recently. She looked great! -Come lady, come! -Fresh, daily, five bucks for a kilo. -Detective! -Nice to meet you. -Only I'm a little offended. -Why? Why won't you accept me? I've been sitting for the police exam for two years. Look, dear, I'm really busy right now. Let's talk later. But the police force needs me and that's a reality. Yes, dear. I for one know what the weight of a uniform means. -Yes. -My father was a cop. -In other words, you have to accept me. -You know what you should do? -What? -Go outside now and wait for a bit. -Ok dear? -OK, but I'll wait. Ok, go out and wait. Go on then. -I'll be waiting, okay. -OK. Go outside and wait. -Wait out there. -Detective? -Yes? -Go on. Get a move on. -Welcome, sir. -Hello. -Is this where you work? -Yes. Really? For how long? -Two years. -What? Two years? Sinem. Excellent name. How many beds do you have? -We have around 172 rooms, sir. -Ah, 172. I could fit the whole family here. -Do you require a marriage certificate? -No, sir. Look, can we put an end to the sir-business. Thank you, Sinem. Yes, sir, how can I help you? Dear, I'd like to see the guest list for the last 15 days on my desk immediately. But firstly I'd like a desk for myself. Excuse me? Are you deaf or are you ignoring me? -Are you playing games with me? -No, sir. You misunderstood me. I don't understand why you'd want one. Why? I'm Ejder Bilir from the police department. I want the guest list immediately. Sir... -Can I see some identification? -What identification? -Who are you to be asking me for ID? -No, sir... Are you asking me for identification? Who the hell do you think you are? Sir, you've got me wrong. Mr. Ejder? Mr. Ejder? Yes. OK, dear. Thanks boys. Thank you. The suspect has been found. Thank you very much. Kiss Sinem for me. If you don't, I'll kiss her. -Detective? -What? -Didn't I say that the police needs me? -You did. -I caught a thief. -Good on you! -So? -Call the police? It wouldn't be right to call the police while you're here. -Ok. Show me where. -There's this jewelry shop. Can't you do a bloody thing without me? Careful. Well, you're a cop. Tell them the door doesn't work. So what the hell did you steal at the crack of dawn, man? Is he the thief? Sorry. Are you the thief, man? Bloody hell. What did you steal? Tell me. Don't be afraid. Tell me. -I stole these bangles. -Oh, bangles. Good. Then... -There's this ring. -Look, the ring matches the bangle. It's a set. That's how it works. It's not worth a thing if you don't have a set. OK, what else? -Then I didn't take these. -You didn't? Why not? You forgot because you were in a rush. The new generation! OK, You took this one as well. Wow, you're such a man. You came for this and you leave without it. What else? Then we have something like this. Great. That's nice too. I like these. These are made in Diyarbakır. They're given to the bride at weddings. It also has a necklace. So you pocketed that too? -I took this Diyarbakır. -You pocketed it. -I walked out. -Well, you needed some air. The kid went out for some air. That's normal. Then what did you do? -There's a motorbike here. -It's nice, man. Look, I'll break your head if you ride without a helmet. What next? -I got on the bike. -Ok, so you got on the bike. It's extremely important for us to see how things develop with these types of cases. Then what did you do, dear? -Then I started the bike. -You started it. See how he steps on the juice. OK, then what? Then I rode off. I swear he went. Obviously the kid's in need. What can you do? The bike! My bike! My bike! There you go. He'll catch him. The case is solved. -Detective, he's gotten away. -But he didn't escape from you, did he? Why did I do this? I did it to test the hotel's security. Everything's a part of the plan. Mecit! Müfit! Back to headquarters. -What happens now? -You'll get some paper from the station. -What paper? -Toilet paper. Dickhead. What paper? -Hello, is the chair free? -Yes. Great! -Why are you leaving? -You sat down. -You said it was free. -You caught me off guard. It's a word thing. You're as smart as you look. -Don't believe everything you see. -I have to tell you something, Pelin. How do you know my name? I said how do you know my name? Let's have a drink together and I'll explain everything, OK? Waiter! Dear! Son! Hey! Someone hear me, please! -Yes? -Two tea, one with sugar. Then sugar for the other one as well. Two tea. Run along then. Cancel one of the teas. Where'd she go? Look, look! What look? You're always ill-timed. Go on. Smile, smile, smile. Move along. Where'd she go? Pelin? Buddy! -Follow that black van. -Piss off! Jeez! What's his problem? Sorry for disturbing you. I was going to ask you what the traffic's like towards Sarıyer. Sarıyer, that's right. Along the shore. Yeah, I know it's peak hour too. I was going to ask which road I should take. Hold on a minute. Hold on just a second. Hey mate! Mate! Mate! Maybe I have something important inside! Well I'm going to Sarıyer, can you give me a ride, too? Hey mate! Tekin, that's so not on, son! I'm a detective. I focus on nothing else when I'm on duty. Come off it! I could have become a private detective with İsmail's retirement pay as well. Rather than making wisecracks, Hamdi, let's get İsmail out. Hold his head. Careful. Tekin, it's rude. -Why put İsmail in the boot? -You said that already. There's no such thing as a private detective in this country. It's like selling antifreeze in Kenya. -You're playing with İsmail's life. -That's a bit heavy. It's not something to be taken lightly, Tekin. You lost your father, don't go and lose İsmail as well. You have no one. Loneliness is pretty risky. It's mostly the lonely who get lost in this world. Hamdi, you've done my head in! You haven't let me sleep. Nightmare after the other. -İsmail? -Are you OK, İsmail? -I'm OK, Hamdi. How are you? -İsmail? Hamdi, tell that person next to you that I'm not talking to him. -I missed my class because of him. -But İsmail? Hamdi, tell the same person that I'm nothing to him. -But İsmail, duty... -Hamdi, tell him! He can hear you, what do you want me to say, man? Hamdi, repeat, if a person doesn't exist for me, he no longer exists. Even if the Two Seas meet. Let's do this, you drive the car as the key person of the operation. I'm saying Two Seas, Tekin. No time for holiday! We're running late for the operation. But you always do the same thing, Tekin. I deserve to go to the seaside as well. -Money, Tekin? -OK. -Seventy bucks. -That would be good. İsmail, 70. But I'll pay you back next month, OK? -Tekin, I'm talking about the fine! -Whatever, I accept it, Hamdi. -As long as I can stick my feet in water. -Tekin, the fine! -Do you have change? -No, I swear. -Then hopefully next month. -How long can you live on credit, Tekin? Until the cows come home. -Why'd you lock me up in the boot? -I've fallen in love. If someone was to hit us from behind, how would we pay for the bumper? I have a plan. Why don't I speak to the girl's mom openly? We're going to class. I've missed it. We may as well just return the car. The most beautiful creature in the world is kidnapped, yet you keep going on about your class, the car. -That girl probably ended up in the slums. -I'm begging you. -You? Please! -We have to go to the lady's house. -We drop off the car first. -Duty first! -Car first! -Duty! -Car first! -Duty first! -Car first! -Don't forget. It's duty first! -Car first! -Two breaks in a car, ridiculous man! -I said car first! -Duty first! -Tekin, car first! -Duty first! -Car. -Don't step on the breaks! Duty first! -Car first! -Duty first! -Let's return the car! -Get your foot off the break. Remember our philosophy! Tops Detectives: Hot air rises! Excellent slogan! -Do you want one from me as well? -Go on. The person you trust the most in life fucks you. -Car first! -Duty! -Car! -Duty! -Car first, Tekin! -Duty! -Car! -OK, the car. Let's return the car then. We've been walking for 35 minutes because you, İsmail, put a spanner on the operation of our lives, and we're still not there yet. Tekin, you had the car towed, that's why we're walking. Don't mention names in these recordings. It's a secret operation. That's why we haven't been able to find the house. Alright, we will ask. -Excuse me? -Not at all. Dear guests! While our children are having fun here, why don't we all go upstairs and listen to Suzan? -Why'd we stop, Tekin? -It says welcome. So? It means that we're expected. It could be a trap. -A booby trap? -Not like that. -They could be listening to us. -Good idea. Let's take a break. -What are we going to do with you, İsmail? -That's what I'm wondering too. SNOW WHITE ENTERTAINMENT Thank you. I'd like to offer my deep gratitude to you for coming to this reception on behalf of homeless children. It truly makes me happy to see that the charity we founded in the garden here with eight women has grown like a snowball day by day, and transformed into a foundation. "Once upon a time, a beautiful girl named Snow White lived in a palace. Her mother had died and she had to live with her evil stepmother. This stepmother, the queen, was vain." İsmail, the coast is clear. Let's go. I worked as a traffic cop for 25 years, now look at the state of me! It's not my fault! They don't have any other costumes. Don't you think I'd like to be Superman? Let's go over our plan. You'll be the evil queen, and I'll be the mirror that tells the truth. You ask me: "Is there anyone fairer than me?" And I will say: "Of course not, Your Majesty." What is that, İsmail? Tekin, they always said it but I never believed it. A person really does get nervous before going on stage. God! He's worried about the stage! Thanks to us, homeless children now have many people who care for them. We have become their mothers, sisters, and teachers. Our children... The detectives are here. They've only been able to kidnap the girl. Yes, thank you all very much. Have fun. -Where are they? -I think they went towards the garden. Your Majesty, what's wrong? Speak! Have you swallowed your tongue? Mirror! What are we doing here, Mirror? But we were always here, Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Evil Majesty, you had a question. The one that we rehearsed. Your Majesty, get to the question and stop loitering! -What is it, İsmail? -İsmail's not here! I'm the Mirror! It's always the same! I can't start the operation because of you. Our little guest wants to meet you, Suzan. Is that so? Come here, sweetness. Yes, take a photo. Thank you. You made me wear this outfit. You fired me up, and now I'm to blame? -I'm to blame? -Of course you are. What a stupid plan! -Don't knock my plan. -You were born yesterday! Flogging a dead horse with yesterday's shit! -Watch it in front of the kids! -What? I tell the truth, Your Majesty. I am the Mirror, I am. -Give it a rest! -Just try it man! -Look, bro, you're getting on my bad side. -Is that so? I know your good side, too! That's enough! Tekin! Son! Bro! Mr. Tekin! Yes, Mrs. Suzan! Who could have kidnapped your daughter? We're checking out all the nightclubs. Nightclubs? Adnan! Hold me, Adnan. I'm going to faint. Suzan, you're going to fall! See what you've done? Suzan has fainted. Not good. Suzan! Move, mate! We're going to see Suzan. -I know first aid. Let me through. -So how has she been? Still unconscious. I'll let you know when she comes around. -Yes, but we have to question her. -I know first aid. Suzan is not in a position to speak now. You'll have to wait. Don't let anyone in. İsmail, let's go and find the girl's room. This way, İsmail. Where are they? -They'll come when we call. -The car? -We even have a photo. -Nice. -Now create a fake Erdal. -Erdal? We need a fake Erdal to send these idiots after. And get them to be suspicious of him when they walk in. I see. Excellent! But don't let them catch him immediately. -Let them follow him for a while. -Why? Let them think they've been kidnapped because they're after him. And our plan will continue from where it left off. -Let's split, İsmail. -That's right. We don't get along. Adnan, these men have made me really tense. Don't stress yourself out, darling, you'll age quickly. Don't be insolent. When did I faint? Fifteen minutes ago. Come on, call these idiots and let's send them after Erdal. Adnan! Alright. We're going to get them to suspect Erdal. -I don't want any mistakes this time. -Don't you worry. -Pelin! -Yes, detective. You escaped. I escaped to see you. I would have rescued you if you had waited. No one has ever worried about me like this before. My occupational illness. I can't help it. Detective! Do you like it? Which one? Shall we kiss? Together? -Of course. -Immediately! Tekin! -What? -We're in trouble, Tekin! -What? -They know who we are. We've been exposed. How? The servant caught me but don't worry, I took care of her. -How? -I wrapped her up in a carpet. You did what? -Tekin! -Yes. Please, let's not pressure her, because she's still in shock. İsmail, we're going to play good cop bad cop during questioning. I'm not the bad cop, Tekin. If the word gets out, I'll lose my retirement. I don't mean that. I'll go soft while questioning her and you'll ask the tough questions. -Ask who? -The woman. -Which woman? -Perfect! Yes. So your daughter was kidnapped and placed in a black van this afternoon. I don't understand. I still don't understand. How can a young girl be kidnapped in front of a hotel broad daylight? -Actually, it's obvious. -Shut up! For God's sake! What's there not to understand? -İsmail, you be the van! -No, I don't have a car insurance. -Fine. Then be the other man. -Sir, what are you doing? -Shut up, servant! -At least come in handy. So, they held the girl by the arms and pushed her head down. Push her head, İsmail. Bashing? Sure! Everyone's bashing at their horn! Everyone's out of control. The girl's a mess! They've covered her mouth. Cover it. Two people held her by the arms and threw her in the van. Unbelievable! -Tekin! -Straight to the nightclub. -You let the girl get away. -It's your fault! So this is how it happened. Now I ask you, do you have any enemies? -Yes! -Please, just shut up! Anyone who is jealous of your wealth? There were some people who had their eye on the inheritance. Inheritance? Keeping it all from me! How much did you inherit? -Forty million. -Shit! -Liras? -Euro! Come off it! There's no such thing. So, Suzan, was your daughter betrothed to anyone? No, I don't think so. -It's not an honor killing then. -Actually, the suspect... Servant! -So did your husband have any enemies? -Erdal. I told you not to speak! -Who is Erdal? -Sezai's partner. -Look, still talking! -Erdal is my husband's former partner. They had a few problems towards the end but Erdal isn't our enemy. -He's family. -The killer is the servant! -What! -Don't be afraid, Johnny Guitar! This is a common expression we detectives use. The killer is the servant. In other words, the suspect may be amongst us, near us. From this point on, everyone in this house is equally a suspect. Me included. I'm going to begin the questioning with me. -Question me, İsmail! -First question! What's your name, Tekin? You've known me since I was a kid! Ask something else! What do you call the area where cars line up to get right of way? -How would I know? -It's boundary crossing! -Uncontrolled boundary crossing! -That's heavy! When you say "jump ship", where are you jumping from? -Gentlemen! -Don't interfere! -Ask me when I last saw the girl. -Which club did you sell her to? -That's out of hand, İsmail! -I'm playing the bad cop here. -You don't know how to question! -It's never good enough! I've been a good cop all my career and here I am being despicable just for you. Considering the conflicts between my husband and Erdal, you should start with him. -So you too should suspect Erdal. -I told you to shut up! Take a look at this photo. Incorrect parking! This is Erdal's car. It was shot near the hotel that Pelin was staying in. I see. I have some very sad news for you. What? Unfortunately the clues point to one thing only. What? They may have kidnapped your daughter for a ransom. -Who? -The kidnappers. -Who are they? -The kidnappers. -What do they want from us? -Ransom. the chick doesn't understand. Fortunately, that's not our problem. We have solved these sorts of situations quite often. -Isn't that right? -It's not right. -What happens at the end? -What happens to whom? -At the end of these situations! -We start to argue like this! That's not what I mean. What happens at the end of these ransom cases? Oh. We'll find out together but as I said: "From this point on everyone in this house is equally a suspect." -But, Erdal... -Shut up! Why do you keep defending Erdal? Who are you to defend Erdal? You're irritating me! I know who I need to be suspicious of! -I've got it! -What? Erdal! I'm changing the whole course of the operation. We're going to start with Erdal. Come on, let's go. Well, I think İsmail as a staff member should stay here, right? Isn't that right? Yes. I think having a professional might make things easier. -İsmail? -Yes. -Are you sure? -Have you any doubt? -Well no, of course. -Well if you did have doubts... -Just as I expected. -What? This is the exit. But I need a car. -Adnan! -Yes? I didn't want to mention this in front of Suzan but Erdal called a few times and asked for Pelin. -I think that... -Don't gossip, servant boy. You have it ready. Thank you. Goodbye. -Tekin, that car... -The car is with me. Don't worry. Tekin! Was the one in the back an automatic, too? That was close! I swear. I think I wet my pants. How could I have the face to die If my mom gave birth to me It's better to settle down And put a smile on her face My dad molded me So that I can become someone It's better to find a job and pay the rent And then I run into you Brand new car. Hit me like a ton of bricks And I was startled I've been running from myself Going crazy thinking of you I got infected with your heart Now I am sick Great! I fell from the horse That I've been riding backwards I'm infected I've been running from myself Going crazy thinking of you I swear, a convertible is mad. It's so cool. I fell from the horse That I've been riding backwards -Hello! -Hello! It's me, Adnan. Speak up, Johnny Guitar. Now you're probably going to his office. I was going to tell you not to bother. Go straight to his house because he'll be leaving in 15 minutes. Am I going to ask you where I should go and when? No. I was just trying to be of help. I meant to tell you not to go to there for nothing. Who are you to tell me what to do? Cut it short! Hang up. Cops ahead. I've been running from myself Going crazy thinking of you I got infected with your heart Now I am sick I've been running from myself Brilliant! I fell from the horse That I've been riding backwards I am infected First day of operation, I'm in front of the girl's father's partner's office. The weather is mild. And I'm never going to wear briefs again. They've crushed my balls! -What's the time? -Quarter to three. How long will you be here for? I have a three o'clock reservation coming. I can arrange somewhere else. OK. I'll be leaving in five minutes. -Then give me a fiver. -Here you go. Go on then. -Five bucks. -For five minutes? -Up to an hour. -No way. I've got no change. We'll change it. -Where are you? -We're in the car. -Where exactly? -I'm sitting in the driver's seat. -Location, idiot? -Location? Piss off! For five bucks! Who do you think you are? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? -Who are you? -So, who are you? -No, who are you? -Who are you? Who are you? Watch your words, we can become a crowd really quickly. -Who are you, man? -Who are you, man? -Who are you? -Who are you, man? -Who are you? -Who are you, man? -Who the hell are you? -Who the hell are you? -And who are you, man? -Who are you? Well, that was really quick, really. Just ask anyone here. They'll show you. Call when you're near. I'll pick you up, bro. -He's gone to the office. -The office? He had to follow the bogus Erdal, not the real Erdal. Oh, OK. So what are we doing now, tell me that? Now get rid of him before he speaks to anyone. -Give me Bob! -I don't know Bob. Who are you, man! Yes. Bob is someone we all like very much. -Are you here for a reason? -You handing over the money? -I don't carry much cash. -Who are you, shit face? -Handing over the money? -Yes, yes. -Who are you? Bloody Pops! -Hit the gas. -How are you? -Good, thanks. Adnan's calling. Speak to him. -Hello. -Hello. Where are you? They're at the fitness center. What are you doing there? Finish this off quickly. He hung up! Give it here. Why were we following this man? Emin, son. Go get the van, the van. Hey. How's it going? Going for a swim. Excuse me, can I make a request? -Please do, please do! -Excuse me? Please, make a request. Take a shower before entering the pool, please. What's the situation? Everything's going to work out fine. Don't you worry. Adnan, if she doesn't die, they won't let us have a sniff of the inheritance. I'm aware of everything darling, don't you worry. You might be aware, but are the men? Will they be able to pull this off? Suzan, I told you that I'd sort it out, but when you tried to get a detective to be the witness, you got these idiots onto us. I was talking about the idiots you found. Will they be able to catch them this time? Everything's going to be fine. Don't worry. All you should think about is what we're going to do when the whole inheritance is ours. I already have. What are you yelling for? No yelling! Just a minute, I'm a detective. There's nothing to worry about. Don't scream! OK, you're all so bloody precious! How's it going? OK. I'll keep it short. As Shakespeare said: "Some things can be and some things can't be." Erdal, why would a person kidnap their partner's daughter? You have to answer it like a man. So tell me. How can a person kidnap his partner's daughter? We're speaking like two gentlemen here. Do you understand? Why don't you kidnap the mother, kidnap Johnny Guitar. Kidnap him. Better yet, kidnap me! Ok then, you can have İsmail. If I'm not enough, you can have him too. He can move in with you forever if you want. Take him as well. How could you kidnap this girl? Tell me that. That's what I ask. How can you do such a thing to such a beautiful girl? How could you kidnap her? That's what I wanted to ask. You're going to tell me where she is. You will tell me. I am asking you a question as a detective and I expect an answer. Where's the girl? Tell me. You've got five seconds or we'll have to go outside and duke it out. Where's the girl? This place is hot like hell. What is this, man? I'm a detective. Answer me. Let's get out of here quickly. Answer me! Who are you to not answer a detective? I'm pleading with you, who are you? Who are you, man? Where's Erdal? Grandpa, how long have you been here? Did they forget you here? What happened to you, man? You're a mess, all wrinkled. Go, save yourself. Get out of here. Hold on man! Is the chair free? -What are you doing? -We're knocking him out! Don't, please, don't cry Suzan. They may never release the girl. We must be prepared for the worst. -They're calling you. -Who? They didn't say but I think it's about Pelin. -Hold on. -But İsmail... Quiet! Hello! Hello! Hello! If you want to see the girl, listen carefully to what I have to say. Now you listen to me carefully. Why would you kidnap someone's daughter and sell her off to the nightclub! The girl's mother is crying her heart out. Tell me. How much money do you want? We don't want money. What we're after isn't money. -They don't want money. -Let me talk to them. No, Suzan, I'm doing the bargaining. So what do they want? So tell me. If you don't want money, why kidnap the girl? We're not playing games, you know! You will immediately sign the necessary paperwork to hand over Sezai's company to Erdal. Who is Sezai? There's no one here by that name. -You have the wrong number. -Sezai... Which girl did you kidnap exactly? Sezai is my deceased husband's name. The woman's husband died and you're still going on about a company. What do you want? Tell it straight. I think they want to take over my husband's company. Don't interfere, Suzan. So you want the company? We didn't quite understand. Yes, idiot! You will sign all the necessary paperwork for the company's transfer immediately, or the girl dies. They want the company. But that company means so much to me. The girl's become a whore, and you still worry about the company! OK. I'll sign whatever they want. Just bring whatever it is that you want us to sign but don't inform the police. And be at the Kartal car yard in an hour. -Car yard? -The car yard? Yes. Is there a problem? No, of course not but if we don't do as they say, they may harm Pelin. -What happened? What do they want? -Who? You just spoke on the phone... They want to meet at the car yard. We'll talk there. Talk about what? Well I didn't get into details. The phone could be tapped. They want me and Pelin to sign the company over to Erdal, isn't that right, İsmail? Didn't I just say that? So Erdal was behind all of this, huh? -Yes. -Then we'd better get a move on. -Do we have another five minutes? -Yes. Then we have time. Don't Rush. Go ahead. -Let's go and have a talk with these men. -What's he doing here? Who? -Let's go. -I'm coming. -Car? -It's ready. Help me out! Help me out! So you were here! I was looking for you. -You were looking for me? -Where have you been? Why were you looking for me? I'm going to rescue you. I'm here to rescue you. -Looking like this? -It's all a part of the job. -Are you a masseuse? -No. I'm a detective. A detective? Yes, but not like the ones in America. We don't arrest people. It's more about documentation. We don't arrest people. I did it a few times and I was arrested. It was really distressing. Can't approach someone looking like this and say: "You're under arrest!" No one believes you. Let's say you and I are together and if something happens to you, well, then I can intervene. I can rescue you. So, there's no arresting but I can rescue you. -It's all a part of the plan. -So you have a plan, do you? -Sure, of course. -Can I ask you something? -Go ahead. -How? -How? -How do you plan to rescue me? Take a look at yourself first! Look at yourself! What plan? Answer me, how are you going to save me? I think you should stop taking drugs because your head's off this planet. -What drugs, idiot? -Let's not scream, dear Pelin. -How do you know my name? -I'm telling you, I'm a detective! -Which planet are you from? -Our office is in Kasımpaşa. -Just behind the bread shop. -I'm going out of my mind! It's the drugs. Your eye was twitching like this when I walked in. So sad. And so young, too. Hold on a minute, what drugs are you talking about? How do you know my name? Who sent you here? Who are you? Please, I can't win, can I? -I'm here to rescue you. -Who are you to rescue me? -Who are you? -Who are you? -For the love of God, who are you? -Answer me! -And I'm asking you. Don't yell at me! -Who are you? -I swear I'm going to smack you! -Look at yourself! -Who are you, man? -How did you untie your hands? -I'm a detective. -Untie mine too. Quick! What for? You keep yelling. That's not the way! You have to be polite. Someone's coming. Quiet! -Where have you been? We're freezing! -Shut up! -Pelin? -What do you want from me? A signature. No one is kidnapped for a signature. That's ridiculous! Don't ever interrupt me again! You're going to sign your father's company over to Erdal. -What? -We are speaking your language. We better not get Erdal angry, right? Well, the signature is easy. We'll fix that, right? -No! I won't sign a bloody thing! -Yes, you heard the girl. You say that now but you'll change your mind later. I'll smash your face in! Look, he's running away! He sensed that I'd smash his face in, that's why he's running. -Go on. Untie me too! -Go on? What a romantic day! -Now you want me to untie you? -What romance? Just untie me. -You said you'd untie me. -Well, I'm not going to. -I said I'd rescue you. -What about the plan? It's all a part of the plan. I'm not untying you. You can just trip out a little more. This is a serious case. -Welcome. -Shut up! What are they up to? They're downstairs. I tied them up. What did I just say? -You told me to shut up. -Congratulations. Downstairs? Yes. Good. Take the girl and the man to the car yard in an hour. -Where did the car yard come from? -Change of plan. -Why? -No questions. Just do as I say. At the car yard in an hour. Is the door locked? -It's locked. Oh, I'm going to lock it. -The latch? Yeah, yeah. Wonder if there will be any traffic around the car yard. Let's not go there. Isn't there somewhere easier to get to? OK. Just shoot them in the middle of Taksim. Great! Let's do it. Where did you find this idiot? He's my brother-in-law. He's married to my wife's sister. He is my brother-in-law, isn't he? Whatever. When you get to the car yard and you're signing over the documents, listen to this carefully, you shoot the girl. No shooting. There wasn't supposed to be any shooting. Just shut up. The price doubles if there's shooting involved. -No. -We have a deal. We don't have a deal. We can't shoot anyone. Blood makes me queasy. I don't care who does the shooting. Just finish it off. Do we kill the man now then? If so, there's also the girl. What happens to her then? She becomes a witness. We'll have to shoot her. Then the police will get involved. There will be a huge commotion. It'll get messy. Should we just kill him? You're not going to kill the man, idiot. You're just going to kill the girl. -Reason? -The man's a detective. We're fucked. You've done us in. We're done. Hold on a minute. Don't worry. I'm going to sort it out man. So how's that going to work? You're going to shoot the girl while the company's being signed over to Erdal. Then that idiot detective will tell the police on the crime scene that Erdal's men killed the girl. And who are Erdal's men? -Us! -That's it! -It's that simple then. -Yes. Just one thing to remember. You're only to shoot the girl. -Because the man is... -A witness. -Where's the man? -He probably had things to do. He's gone. He saw that the plan was moving along without a hitch. Hey, how are we going to kill the girl? For God's sake, who did you take after? Please! The man's been explaining his plan. We'll shoot the man and then it's over. They're going to put the blame on Erdal. Where's your head? You're not focusing. Everyone's got it, but you. He's saying that we have to shoot the man. We're going to shoot him. The girl? What do you mean, who's Erdal? He's your father's partner. -Did Uncle Erdal do it then? -Yes. Who else? For God's sake! What do you think? The man's done everything to take over your father's company. -Uncle Erdal wouldn't do such a thing. -Of course he wouldn't. Erdal had a mosque made, why would he do such a thing? Why not? Listen to what I'm saying. These men first kidnapped you in front of the hotel, then the same men kidnapped me because I was following Erdal. How do you know this? You're the man from the hotel! -Is the seat free? -Are you following me? -I am, because I'm a detective. -Detective, my ass! Pervert! These accusations really hurt. I'm just trying to do my job. Your mother hired me to find you. -My mother? -Yes. -I don't have a mother. -Take that back. My mother's dead. Who's Suzan then? Suzan? She's not my mother. She's my father's second wife. -How do you... -You know, I admire that woman. She treats you like you're her own daughter. Because I told her: "Suzan, your daughter's been kidnapped." You should have seen the way she cried! She was shattered. As they say, she was wailing from the heart. Her chest was exposed while crying. That's how I saw her heart. -That convinced me. -What, did Suzan cry? And that's why we have to get out of here, I don't know how but I'm taking you straight back to your mother. That woman's not my mother. Plus, I'm not going anywhere. -What do you mean? -I'm not coming, simple as that! -You are, if I'm telling you to! -Don't raise your voice with me! Then you should be a little more polite. You can't do whatever you want just because you have an amazing body. How dare you speak to me this way? I'll speak the way I want. My career is on the line here. What career, you idiot? Detective! Who's he kidding! For God's sake! Are you calling me a liar! Talk to me properly. Put everything else aside. I'm older than you for one, so you should show me a little respect. What if I don't? I'll slap you so hard you'll hit the wall! Simple as that! -You won't rescue me? -That's right! You've been yelling all morning! Despicable woman! -Hush! Someone's there. -Of course someone's there! You yelled so much that everything's gone out of control! -We're going to get caught! -So be it. It's not working between us. Whatever happens, happens. I've had enough. -On three. -Getting undressed? -Punch, stupid! -I can't hit you. Maybe I like you? How can you expect me to punch you? Not me, you're going to punch the man! I'm going to punch the man! You women are all the same! It's the first day of our relationship and you're already making me fight. You're testing me. I'd like to get to know each other first. Let our skins meet first. It needs time. -Just punch the man when he comes! -Oh, punch the man. Great idea. OK then. I thought of that as well. Below the belt? Okay, I'm ready then. I'll punch him when you say so. What the hell's going on here? Brilliant woman, man! They're getting away! Bro! Bro! Shit, man. Where did they go? Come on. Hurry! -Does this car have tax stamp? -Excuse me? -Tax stamp? -I don't know, probably. What do you mean you don't know, Suzan? What about insurance? I don't know, İsmail. I don't deal with things like that. But that's not right, Suzan. Now if a cop pulls us over and asks for our papers, what will we say? How about license and registration? See? They got away. You're useless man! -Give me a break! -Come on. Come here! I'm talking to you! -Come here. -What are you doing? -What are you doing? -Hold on to me. Shit! -Are you OK? -Is the house OK? What house? There they are! Hey, you, wait there! Come on! It's the right season! Everyone's changing their car. What are you saying, İsmail? Why don't we buy a car while we're at it? A Sedan. -Sedan? -You know, the ones with large boots. -They're really handy for picnics. -What picnic, İsmail? Where are we going to meet the men? -Somewhere here. -Somewhere here? Yes, right. Like we're trading cars. We say the secret code, and we make an agreement. And what would the code be? We sign the documents, you let the girl go. -That's the code? -Which one? -We sign the code, you let the girl go. -Is that the way, then? -Let's kiss. -What are you saying, you idiot? -We have to kiss to convince them! -Run, they're getting close. We can kiss while we run. In here, in here! It's clear. Run, go on! Come on! Here, put this on! -What now? -I have a plan, just put it on! We got away, Pelin! -What's going on? -What? You don't open a shop on a public holiday! Come here, you! -Horsepower? -Ninety. -We have a deal for 70. -It's like a woman. He says it's like a woman. I think we've found our guy. I don't think it's them. Come on, let's go. Suzan, I'm a good judge of character. Leave it to me, please. -Are we trading? -Yeah. What do you have? -An important signature. Where's she? -Well, here she is. Where are you going? -What's happening there? -Let's jump. -Why? Let's just walk down from there. -Let's jump. No, I won't jump. Don't jump! -Are you okay? -Such luck! I landed on the ball. Hey! Sorry, kid. Where are they? Adnan, where are these men? You screwed it all up. What? Then go and catch them. Idiots, you can't get a thing right! Don't you think I know this car was made in Korea? Korea doesn't even manufacture cars with more than 70 horsepower! Get lost, mate! Piss off! I'm old enough to be your father. How dare you talk to me that way? -Give us the girl! -They've changed the meeting spot. Let's go. It's not them. Come on, let's go! I know, Suzan. I was just trying to bargain. What do you want from us? What's up? Out of breath, aren't you? Come here, you jerk! Is this the bottom end of Salih Mehmet Road? -Yeah, so? -What's the time? -It's five. -Brilliant! -Mahmut! -Who's Mahmut? -Hey, take a look at this! -Come here, Tekin from Tops Detectives! Hey you! -Who are they? -I don't know. Back off! Mahmut, they even brought the cameraman, see? That's luck for you. They're getting away. Bro! What are you doing, bro? See how they ran away? A bunch of men with sticks and rakes in their hands. Bro, who the hell are they? I have no idea. They had a camera. Let's hope they don't show us on the news. We'll be a laughingstock, the wives will see us. -Hey man! Where did they go? -How would I know? The police! We're going to the police! Where have you been? Everyone's been expecting you. Well the van's tire... -Where to? -I don't know, come on. What exactly are we doing here? -OK, man, alright. -Ok, get a move on. WELCOME TO THE POLICE OFFICERS' BALL This is yours? You keep going. Welcome. -Pelin! Where are you going? -What's it to you! -God! Just listen for once. -What, what do you want? I have to take you to your mother. That woman's not my mother. Don't get pissed off, darling, just say it nicely. You can't run off. What is it, İsmail? We have İsmail and Suzan. If you don't bring the girl immediately, they both die. Be at the dockyard with the girl at midnight. What? Pelin! Pelin! Stop, Pelin! Wait! Open the window. -Is he disturbing you? -So what if I'm disturbing her! No, I'll sort it out. You're starting to piss me off! And now they've kidnapped İsmail and Suzan. Who's İsmail? Well, exactly! Why would you kidnap İsmail? -Is this part of the plan? -This wasn't included. They've just called. We'll be at the dockyard at midnight. Such a stupid excuse! Tell Suzan I'm not coming. -They really have been kidnapped. -Let's go. Go where? Wait. Where are you going? Wait. You can't go. Pelin! Well, go wherever you want! All girls leave me, man. Unbelievable! Am I always going to be lonely! Will no one ever believe that I have a plan? Will I always simply be part of a plan? Everyone deserts me. Taxi! Don't just stand there. Get in! What? Is there any other way to make you give way! Father you were right Loneliness suits the Lord only I tried hard But happiness is far away While I am far gone in silence Close the deal already And be done with it I wish Oh how I wish You were here I wish Oh how I wish You held my hand I wish Oh how I wish You were right, dad. You said I'd be alone if I lived like this. Everyone said so but I'm not a very good listener. Wish you were here with me. I couldn't protect İsmail either. I know what you're about to say. I was too cocky. Forgive me. If you could just see Pelin. I love her. She's a crazy thing. She is in love with me, too. She asks which planet I live on. She loves me. This time I'm not going to disgrace you. You're going to be proud of me. Let's finish this off. I just don't understand what they didn't like about the car market. Plus, why kidnap me? OK, I understand them kidnapping you. You're wealthy, but why kidnap me? I spoke to the detective. He's coming with the girl. Now tie my hands up. Do we really have to kill the girl? It's just that you get 25 years for murder. -Don't ruin us for nothing, man! -Let's wait, she may just die naturally. Why are you being such cowards? All you're going to do is kill the girl. And then you're going to disappear. Erdal's going to be blamed anyway. No one's going to look for you. But don't shoot the detective. Do you know why? -The man's our witness. -Shall we shoot the old one? Don't shoot anyone but the girl. The reason I ask is because if we do, it will be two murders. In other words, the money will definitely double! Will the punishment rise by double as well? Will it be 50 years? No! 25 each. If we just kill the girl, I get 12 and a half years, that's all. -That's for the injury. -So we'll injure someone? -No, you... -Now if we'll harm someone.... All you're going to do is shoot the girl. Don't shoot anyone else. -OK. I've got the girl. -OK. I've got the old man. Look, the man's been telling you to just shoot the girl, not the man. As long as you don't shoot me. Who are you? You're Erdal's men. You're going to be rough with us. You're the killers so that our plan isn't understood. You're going to be rough with us. -Can you please slow down a little, sir. -Hey! Did you speak to my daughter? Is she coming? Shut up, you old frump! Please, a little slower, sir! Are you going to get me to kill you! Shut up! Look, you think you're scaring me -but I'm a retired traffic cop, my boy. -Leave him. Let's tie this one up. -Shut up! -Ah! Adnan! There he is. How's it going? Did you bring what Erdal wants? That's sorted. I settled it. I spoke to Erdal. -What? Where's she? -That's the question indeed. Untie Suzan. I have spoken to Erdal. Who exactşy did you say you spoke to? Look, didn't you want the girl to sign the documents? Well, I sorted that out with him. Everything is okay. -With Erdal? -Yeah. Erdal's here, son. Who'd you speak to? -Here? -Here? -Here? -Here. Isn't this silent fellow Erdal? Yes, that's Erdal. So, Tekin, who exactly did you talk to thinking it was Erdal? İsmail, that is not Erdal. Hold on a minute. Who exactly did you say you spoke to, Tekin? I rescued the girl. She's beautiful and we look good together. We went to Erdal together. Listen. We went to Erdal. We went to his house and I said: "What sort of person are you?" Then I went for it, held nothing back. I asked: "What sort of person are you? How can a man kidnap his closest friend's daughter? What would you do if we were to kidnap yours?" I was really hard on him. Thankfully he ended up being sensible. He understood and felt really ashamed. He said: "Please, detective, please don't, detective." -I'm going to shoot him man. -Don't! Don't! And he said: "Untie Suzan." He told me: "Say 'please'." He said: "There are going to be two brave and handsome men there and if one of them just happens to be holding a gun..." He said to be really careful because there's no joking with guns. -What's he saying? -He says Erdal... The fool's lying. Erdal was always here with us. You're not helping, İsmail. -Let me shoot him, bro. -Hush! No. You're not helping me either. I get tied to chairs like this as the key man of such an operation and you still won't let me get a word in. -Should I hurt the old man? -Stop! Did I get you tied up? You got yourself tied up! Why are you hurting the old man? He's the girl's grandfather. I came here to save your life and you keep telling me off. I've made a decision. I'll move to the seaside and open a driving school. You don't even have a license. I'm going to shoot him. I'm really confused! Don't. The man's a witness. Shoot the woman. Shut up! You ungrateful thing! How many times have I cleaned up your mess! I witnessed your circumcision! I've seen all your bodily parts. How can you reveal our secrets in front of everyone? -It's Tops, not Pops! -That's enough! Move over and give me the gun. Useless Pops. The woman's stressed out. Everything's sorted. -Be quiet! -Don't blow your cover, Suzan. Quiet! Quiet! What did I say to you? -"I don't have a husband." -Not that, stupid! -"Check out!" -Find the girl and bring her to me. Did I ask for much? It was so easy that even an idiot like you could have done it, but what did you do? -I found the girl. -I have been waiting for years for that senile man to die and just when it was my turn, an idiot like you appears and ruins all my plans. But I won't allow it, do you understand? -Is that gun real? -Tell me, where's the girl? Don't, Suzan. But he's our witness! -Tell me where the girl is. -You can't shoot him. He's our witness. -Shut up! -Shit! My leg! Erdal, see? She shot the man in the leg. Now listen. Tell me where the girl is or I'll kill you. Tekin! She's shooting! Tell her where the girl is! If she's shooting at us, she'll definitely kill the girl. She's her stepmother. -Her stepmother? You hussy, you! -Shut up! Tell me where the girl is, otherwise I'll kill İsmail right here. Suzan, don't let the devil get the better of you. -Shut up, you demented Pops! -Erdal, check this hussy out! Look, I'm counting to three. Tell me now, otherwise I'm going to shoot İsmail! Suzan! That's enough. You're messing with our life. Our life already got messed up because of your stupid men. You shut up, too! Three, two, tell me! Let me and İsmail go, otherwise I'll kill myself. Go on then fool! Then you won't find out where the girl is. He's right. Do you know what it's like to be shot? -No. Hopefully this will be the first! -Good. Let me do the honors. Please do, Suzan. It's tough when things don't go as planned. I know that all too well. Some of us make plans all our life and some of us just end up being part of the plan. But I'm not like you. I respect experience. Don't ever forget what our fathers say: "The weakest moment is when you feel the most confident." İsmail! -Son! -Where are you going, İsmail? Come here, you! Tekin! I'm telling you to come here! Come here! Come here! -Untie me. -Untie me, too, Erdal! He's not Erdal, İsmail! Oh dear! Come here, Pops Detective! This is not the end of this, Suzan! Look, just untie me. I know first aid. Just untie me. I'll get both of them up on their feet. Where are you, Suzan? -Suzan! -Come here! I'll kill you! Suzan, this is not the end of this. Where are you, Suzan? Get lost! Suzan! You'll go in there and you'll be in for it. -Just as I planned. -Here I am. You can't escape me. I swear. Come here, Suzan. -Tekin! Come here. -Come here! Tekin! OK, don't move! Put your hands up in the air! Up! It would be hard not to fall from here, man. What a mess! Hold them! Go on! Quick! I've gone way out to sea, man. I'm here, İsmail! This is not the end of this! Calmly, calmly. Bend my head. Let go! Let me go! You're finished too, Adnan! You're finished too, Adnan! I'm going to destroy you, too, Tekin! -Come here, Tekin! -Officer, I'm drifting way out. Officer! Can you pick me up as well? I'm a detective. İsmail! -Wow, I wasn't hit. -See! -Bro! -Hey! -What? -Get up! I thought I got shot. I fainted, but I wasn't shot. I fainted because I thought I saw blood. Didn't I say I'd get them both on their feet? It's so cold. I'm sailing to the other... The other... I'm here! Then we'll just keeping heading this way. Thank you. Don't be upset. They won't harm you anymore. I'm sad for my father. He was never aware. So is there anything else I can do for you? -No, Uncle Erdal. -She's here to rescue me. -Who? -Pelin. -Were we rescued by that girl? -Well, yeah. Suzan planned the whole thing. Pelin just came with Erdal. Of course. I knew that Suzan planned everything from the start. -You knew! -Of course. Look, Tekin, son, the girl comes and says her daughter's been kidnapped. She has a phone number, we tell her to call, she won't. It was so obvious that she planned the whole thing. She thought she'd kill the girl and get the inheritance. Those things aren't that easy! Isn't that right, son? -Why didn't you say anything? -Adventure's sake. Adventure? Don't tell the detective that I came to you, okay? -Whatever you want. -Thank you for everything. -Stay with us for a while, if you want? -No, thanks, Uncle Erdal. It will do me good to get away for a while. Ok, it's up to you. See you then. -Bye. -Ok. Alright. Compliment me when the girl comes, OK? Excellent, Tekin. Brilliant. You've got excellent reflexes. -Thanks. -Watch out for this boy. He's got really good reflexes. Tekin's reflexes are really good. That's İsmail for you. Also, it was quite a fine act of you to come and rescue me. My pleasure. What happened to your hand? These sorts of things happen all the time because I'm a detective. -I... -I... -You first. -OK. Pelin, despite everything we went through, it was kind of beautiful. We can say it was fate, but regardless of what you do, we're from two different worlds. I know. Why did you just say that? Oh. So that's what you think. -Thanks for everything. -You're welcome. Goodbye. Sir, can you make a statement regarding the incident? The police seem to think that you played a big part in this. Are you proud of your firm? Well, we at Pops Detectives... Wait, that's wrong! Tops, not Pops. Tops! Tops! The ransom payoff ended at the police station...
