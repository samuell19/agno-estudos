[CROWD CHEERING] DULCIE: Come on. Show him, Ned. -Look now, it's Hanlan. TOAD: Yeah. -Go on, Ned. Run that donkey. -Come on, Ned. Go. COONEY: Keep on rowing. Hey. Hey, you're a cheat. Hey, that's not fair. You bloody bugger, that's not fair. Foul. -Cheat. Foul. -Bye. You bastard. MAN 1: Pull back, Ned. MAN 2: Come on. Pull! DULCIE: Come on, Ned. TOAD: You got him, Ned. COONEY: Hey, Neddie, you pissed right down his backside. [CROWD SINGING] NED: Lookie, who's here? Mr. Hanlan? Bill McCoy. We met on the water. Dulcie, say hello to Mr. McCoy, the famous oarsman. Hello, Mr. McCoy, the famous oarsman. -Joining the minstrel show, Mr. Hanlan? -Putting on my business suit. Good. I'm here on business myself. Five bucks a case. Good stuff. Throw in the glass. I don't need your moonshine, but I have a proposition for you. Have you heard of the Centennial? Regatta in Philly? All the top oarsmen will be there. The real grease-bum boys. -So? -So I'll be your manager. Make you some real money. -And I'll get you a proper shell to row in. -You want me in the race? -I saw you today. You're a natural. COONEY: He was just coasting. You should see him pulling by moonlight with the cops up his arse. [LAUGHING] Yeah, rowing in the hot sun? Too much like work. Who wants to go all the way to Philly for that? Listen, nobody knows you from Adam, some hog grubber from Canada. I could get 50-1 odds on you easy. I've been waiting years for a sure lay like this. No, not for me. You don't know how good you are, do you? Sure I do. Don't I, sweets? [LAUGHING] NED: I got a delivery to make. Be nice to him, Dulcie. The man had a crushing defeat today. -All loaded, Cooney? COONEY: Yep, eight boxes. NED: Yeah, well, then cast off. I'm on my way. Isn't he cute? NED: Strike her up, Toad. [CROWD SINGING ] WOMAN: Bye! [CROWD SINGING ] TOAD: Watch out for the coppers, Ned. MAN: Good luck, Ned! DULCIE: Bye, darling. I'll be here when you get back. [HORSE NEIGHING ] Who's there? Repent, repent, repent, ye sinner. LEADER: Seize his godless cargo of foul liquor. THIN COP: Stop where you are! LEADER: Bring him to retribution. THIN COP: Shoot the bugger! SERGEANT: Hanlan! Come on, grab the bastard. SERGEANT: Come on, lads, lend a hand. MAN: Pull! LEADER: Smite him with the light, brothers. -Shoot him! Shoot him! SERGEANT: I said no guns! LEADER: Get the bastard! THIN COP: Head him off. LEADER: Get him! THIN COP: Nab him. That's it, men. NED: Piss off. [YOUNG COP SCREAMING ] LEADER: He's getting away! SERGEANT: I'll get you! I'll get you, you little scum. NED: Boys, I can't stop. I got another delivery to make. [NED SINGING ] [DULCIE MOANING ] Oh, Ned. Ned. -Should we let them finish, sir? -Finish? Give mercy to that degenerate up there? Disgusting. It's not bad enough that he breaks the laws of God and man. . . . . .by selling illegal liquor, but he also fornicates out of wedlock. Arrest him. -Edward Hanlan? -Hanlan! DULCIE: Oh, Ned. SERGEANT: Hanlan! Oh, Ned. Oh, Ned. -It's the cops. -Oh, my, God, yes. Edward Hanlan, stay where you are! Edward Hanlan? [SCREAMS] DULCIE: Ned! [DULCIE LAUGHING ] DULCIE: Oh, God. -Good morning, Mr. Hanlan. NED: What are you doing here? BILL: Let's just say I'm here to help you. Come on. -What are you doing here? -We'll talk about it later. -Maybe you'd better start rowing. -Rowing? Where? [HORN BLOWING ] Are you crazy? I can't catch that. DULCIE: Oh, Ned, go! COP: Stop, Hanlan! Edward Hanlan, stop where you are. Stop where you are or I'll shoot. DULCIE: Ned! SERGEANT: Hey, John, get the boat. Hanlan, get back here. You're under arrest. NED: Not where I'm sitting, I'm not. Beautiful morning. [BELL RINGING ] [HORN BLOWING ] I guess you won't wanna be showing your face around here for a day or so, eh? You're in luck. This docks at Rochester. We'll lay low in the States for a few days. Yeah, great, without a shirt on my back. Not to worry. I got connections down there. -In Rochester? -No. Philly. Get you some new clothes. Find us a nice little room. -You bilge rat, you set the law on me! -The qualities you'll need in a manager. -You stool pigeon. -The suit! The suit! You'll hurt yourself. You won't be able to row. He's gonna dunk him. -Back in the water, bilge rat. STEWARD: Steady now, there. -Steady, steady, now. -I'm fine. I'm fine. STEWARD: All right, everything's all right. That's a hell of a way to treat your new partner. With all the trouble I went to, arranging-- Oh, come on, you're just lucky this boat went by. Lucky? It was planned to the minute. All that hanky-panky of yours is what damn near buggered the works. I can't imagine what she sees in you. Oh, really? Same thing you saw: natural ability. MAN 1 : Round up, folks. Line up to see Colonel Buffalo Bill Cody. . . . . .and his incredible Wild West Show. They perform amazing feats at this corral. That's right. See real Indians from the Plains. See that Amazing Emily perform. . . . . .death-defying stunts above and below the ground. Walk up! Walk up! MAN 2: Cotton candy! [CALLIOPE PLAYING ] BILL: No, wrong. I do not agree. Listen, I sent you a wire that-- We made a deal. -That's not what we talked about. -You go to hell. You'll be hearing from my lawyer! You welsher! Gypster! The little weasel. Went and said he had a shell for me, went and sold it. -That's good, Bill. BOY: Psst, hey, mister. I know where you can get a boat. -Yeah? Where? -Cost you a dollar. . . . . .and one of them cigaroots. WALTER: She'll float on dew, boy. -The-- The seat's loose. -Loose? It slides, boy. Slides, slides like butter. I invented her. This will give you 40 yards on the mile, easy. But all them Harvard boys with grease on their backsides won't give it a chance. Laugh at me. Just like him. Look at him. Thinks I'm queer in the attic. Go on, go on, get the hell out of here. MAN: Going swimming, guys? [MEN LAUGHING ] Have you figured how to fasten down that seat, Mr. Brown? -Ah. Come on. PLAISTED: Look at him. Look at him. It will never work. [CHUCKLING ] WALTER: Easy, now. [LAUGHING ] Famous champion. Looks great. What's it like? How's it go? NED: Slides like butter. I see gambling. I see immorality. I see unbridled lust for filthy lucre. Betting and drinking. You will cease these immoral acts. You will mend your ways. BOOKIE: Colonel! Good day to you, sir, Colonel Knox. We ain't seen you since last year. Down here for a little flutter? Five thousand down on Plaisted to qualify. Let it ride on him to win tomorrow. BILL: Ned, come on. NED: What? -I got 1 00-1 on you. -A hundred? -They think you're a bum. -Thanks. Oh, by the way, Merry Christmas. -It's a beauty, eh? -It's baby blue. It'll fit you. ANNOUNCER: Attention, please. Attention. Gentlemen, oarsmen in the first qualifying heat. . . . . .hold your positions and prepare to start. Mr. Hanlan, good luck to you, sir. -Same to you, Mr. Plaisted. ANNOUNCER: Gentlemen. . . . . .are you ready? By the way, Mr. Hanlan, isn't that a crack in your oar? Don't! No, Ned, Ned. Left! Left, Ned! Straighten up, Ned! Straighten up! What--? What are you doing? -What the hell are you doing? -I'm too old to be a laughingstock, boy. BILL: Pull, Ned, 1 00-1 ! Pull! Pull! Come on, Ned, 1 00-1 ! You bring my boat? -What the hell is that? -Fifty bucks. . . . . .for tomorrow's rental. Ned finished second. He qualified. He did it in your boat! Well, look happy, you old coot! [LAUGHING ] [PIANO PLAYING ] Gentlemen, we are rolling in clover. I just turned down 1 000 bucks cash on the line. . . -. . .for Ned to pull a barney tomorrow. -Throw the race? Half the guys in here bet on that Fred Plaisted and they're real scared. Scared? Of me? Mr. Hanlan? Compliments of the gents in the corner. -See? They love me. MAN: Mr. Hanlan? -Oscar Hale, Toronto Globe. NED: Hello. -Now, tell me-- -You got a race tomorrow, boy. -Drink up. Drink up. HALE: Thank you. Now, tell me. How does it feel to be carrying your country's banner against-- They're not reading about me back home, are they? Absolutely. You're front-page news. -I've even given you a nickname. -Yeah? The Blue Flash? HALE: Uh-uh. The Boy in Blue. That makes me sound like some kind of a fancy boy. [HALE GROANING ] Nice try, boys. You take the two on the right. You take the two on the right. MAN: Hey, come back here. [WOMAN LAUGHING ] -Wait your turn, gents. BILL: Not now, lads. Not now. Five minutes, boys. [NED COUGHING ] BILL: Thanks. Ned, come on. -I couldn't breathe. -You were starting to like it. You're disgusting. Thanks, miss. You ought to be an actress. I am an actress. [CHUCKLING ] NED: Ow! Which one's Hanlan? BILL: I'm Hanlan. [SCREAMING ] Yeah, that's good. Come on, Ned. Put your back into it! Go! Come on! You'll get him on the turn. That's it, Ned. Pull! Pull! Show him your stuff. Yeah, that's it. He's yours. Pull! Come on, Walter. Here, lad. Come on. Come on. Come on, giddy up. Come on, Blue Boy! Come on! Pull, Plaisted! Go, Ned! [HORN BLOWING ] [CHUCKLING ] [BELL RINGING ] OFFICER: There he is, up there. NED: The place is crawling with cops. -Take it easy. You're a bloody hero. -What do you mean? -Look. [WHISTLE BLOWING ] -What do I do? -Act like one. NED: Dulcie! -Oh! -I missed you. NED: It's good to see you. He is responsible for the biggest upset in the history of the sport. Beating the best America had to offer. Ned, Ned Hanlan. Gracious, sterling. . . . . .honest, temperate. . . . . .sporting, clean. This young man is the very symbol of all that is noble in this great country. And so now, as your mayor, it gives me great honor and pleasure. . . . . .to present to you, Ned Hanlan. . . -. . .this silver medal. -I like your hat. Ned? -Ned? -Oh. [CROWD CHUCKLING ] MAYOR: Well, now. NED: Thank you. [CROWD CLAPPING ] Ned, I bring you a ride! Come on. NED: Hey. COONEY: Everyone's waiting at the hotel. [NED LAUGHING ] Coming to my party? [BELL RINGING ] Billy! Ned! Ned! Cute, isn't he? Simile. KNOX: Mr. McCoy? I'm Colonel Knox. I have a proposition for you. You gentlemen judges of horseflesh? Judges of fillies, maybe. Oh, I think you know a thoroughbred when you see one, Mr. McCoy. You spotted this young fellow here, didn't you? His unique talents. It's a young country, Mr. McCoy. People don't have a lot. Ripe for a hero. Someone for the common John to look up to, to cheer for. I'm a common John myself, colonel. Precisely. Big words don't butter the beans, colonel. KNOX: All right, Cap, take him out. Oh, we'd see to it that everyone's beans got buttered, Mr. McCoy. You cost me a lot of money in Philly. A man never costs me money twice. We'd back Ned, protect him from undesirable elements. Promote him. We'd manage everything. He's got a manager. -Oh? -Me. Aha. Well, perhaps you'd like to tell me. . . . . .just how you plan to manage your little legal problem. The police are thinking of taking out a warrant on Ned. They don't arrest heroes, colonel. It wouldn't do to have the Boy in Blue locked up for bootlegging. Maggie, dear, may I present Mr. McCoy and Mr. Hanlan? MARGARET: How do you do, gentlemen? KNOX: Gentlemen, my niece, Margaret Sutherland. BILL: Miss Sutherland. Yes, well, should we move into the house for some refreshments? It was quite the reception you had the other day, Mr. Hanlan. All that adulation must have been quite intoxicating. Yeah. Uh. . . . Likewise. But you know what rather surprised me? My speech? That you looked so ordinary. From the newspaper reports, I was expecting some godlike giant of a man. Ah. Well, they say I look bigger with my clothes off. Really. I mean, in my rowing outfit. Yes, your baby-blue suit. It's just blue. So when do we actually get to see some of your famous rowing? Well, I'd be happy to take you out. Give you a demonstration. Would there be room for me in that boat? What with all the liquor cases. BILL: We don't need that crowd, Ned. -You think the Colonel cares about you? -No. He wouldn't piss on you if you were on fire. Would you forget him? What about her? -I think she's foolish for me. -Aw, jeez. You're not gonna go losing your head over some quiff like her, are you? You wouldn't understand, Bill. I'm taking romance here. -Finer feelings. -Finer feel-ups. Hip! We're gonna drift down the river. Just the two of us. Alone with nature. And I'll move closer to her and say: ''Why'd you have to bring her for?'' You wouldn't take me for a girl who'd compromise herself. . . . . .by going out with a gentleman unchaperoned, Mr. Hanlan. Besides, I'm having a lovely time. Aren't you? Well, I'd be having a lot lovelier one if she weren't here. Why? Whatever would you be doing differently? Mr. Hanlan. . . . . .do you mean to say you might be trying to kiss me? -I don't believe you'd have the nerve. -You don't, eh? MARGARET: I think if I gave you my permission to kiss me. . . . . .you'd be petrified. [LAUGHING ] All right. Permission granted. Now? Aunty Gert. -Isn't it a gorgeous day, Aunty Gert? -Lovely. Lovely. BOTH WELL: Well done, Margaret. KNOX: Well, your little legal problem has been forestalled, by the way. I had a word with the mayor. There won't be any charges laid against you. For now. Just another small example of what I meant by giving you protection. Good shot, Margaret. Popping. Who's the blond guy? Andrew Bothwell. Harvard man. MAID: Refreshment for you, sir? Thank you. KNOX: Roger painted him black and he won in a canter. WOMAN: At first, I couldn't imagine what that strange odor was. BOTH WELL: How do you think he wins his races? All the others stay yards behind so they won't be asphyxiated. But surely he must bathe. . . -. . .at least occasionally. BOTH WELL: I doubt it. [WOMAN AND BOTH WELL LAUGHING ] [CHUCKLING ] NED: You really wanna know how I bathe, miss, hmm? First, I do this. -And then I scrub behind the ears. BOTH WELL: Why, you. -Get up, Harvard man! MAN: Good-- Good God! Exactly what do you think you're doing? MAN: Let the man go. GERT: What's happened? Let go of me! Let go of my arm. -Please let go of my arm! -I'm sorry. But this is making me sick, wearing these monkey suits. Hobnobbing with these varsity twits. . . . . .who think they're witty and sophisticated. You wouldn't recognize wit and sophistication if it hit you in the face. Margaret? Are you all right? She's fine. Bugger off. You know. . . . . .I rented a carriage for us today. Three bucks. It has velvet seats and everything. -Can we just-- -We certainly cannot. -Why? You know how I feel about you. -I neither know nor care. My mistake was feeling sorry for you in the first place. Sorry for me? Maggie. . . . MARGARET: William. -Miss Margaret. You may show Mr. Harlan out. And if he calls again, ever, I'm not home. [BAND PLAYING ] COONEY: Souvenir pillowcases! Get them while they're hot! Ten cents, 1 0 cents now, 25 cents after the race. Here you go. Genuine Ned Hanlan souvenir pillowcases! -Take Neddie to beddy-bye. MAN: And now. . . COONEY: Here you go, ma'am. MAN: . . .the event we're waiting for. The undefeated Ned Hanlan. . . . . .will meet three outstanding scullers. . . . ..in a special challenge race. MAN: Step right up, folks. Step right up. Come to me. I'll sell something that'll fix-- -Sparky. -How goes it, Riley? Get this down on the people's choice for me, Chappy. -On Hanlan? -Why should I be a sucker? -I ain't got a harlot's hope against him. -Where is he anyway? She threw me out, Bill. -Here, Ned, drink it. -She threw me out. Listen, you've got a race today, for God's sake. Drink it. They'll wait. They'll wait. They'll wait for the Boy in Blue. Pull, Ned! Pull! Up! Riley's, he's-- He's gaining on Hanlan. Hanlan looks tired, very tired, but he's still pulling. Hard to believe, but Hanlan's lagging. He doesn't seem to be dipping in clean. Where's his old vigor? He seems to have lost his ginger. And the unbeaten champion appears to be falling to the pace of the Poconos. And yes, yes, Riley is moving up on Hanlan. Now Riley has actually passed Hanlan. Could this be an amazing upset in the making or is Hanlan playing possum? Ned, pull! Up! Shoot! Now Riley looks tired. But he's been pulling away. Hanlan seems completely spent. Come on, Ned, pull! COLLINS: He's definitely in the lead. He's skimming. Wait! Wait! Riley seems to have cramped up. Oh, what incredible bad luck. And here comes Frenchy Johnson. He's in the water. [INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] Well, now I've never seen-- Well, row. Row, you lousy loafers. SPECTATOR 1 : Give us our money back! SPECTATOR 2: It's a fix. -Well, somebody row. Excellent, Mr. McCoy. -Excellent job of managing. TOAD: Make way! Make way! [COUGHING ] The offer's still open. Perhaps, Ned might like to reconsider it in the light of this. Reconsider, hell. We have nothing to talk about. For the moment, Mr. McCoy. NED: Boys, I'm back. Put her up again. Toad! [DOOR SQUEAKS] Toad! [COUGHING ] Suck it, sinner. If you make another move, Hanlan, I'll blow your head off. [PRISONERS SHOUTING ] Ned Hanlan? Cell 2. Two minutes. -Ned. -Bill! Are you springing us? You make a deal with Knox, you're out tomorrow. -Knox. -Who do you think you have to thank? He and his syndicate have the mayor in their pockets. -Oh, to hell with them. -Listen. . . . . .the cops are ready to throw the book at you. They'll let you rot in here. Well, say I do sign some piece of paper with him. . . . . .can we just go running our own show? It's you they want, Ned, not me. Knox will give me 500 bucks to crawl back under my rock. -Forget about it, man. We're partners. -Listen. You were born to row. You're the best natural sculler I've ever seen. You spend a year here, you won't be able to whip your sister. -I'll survive. -You could be a figure of glory, Ned. A guy they'll remember long after you've gone. Quit now and they'll call you a fluke. . . . . .a one-shot, say you only won with a trick seat. TURNKEY: Time, slick. -Is that what you want? The heck it is. Now forget about me, make the deal, do it, show them. . . -. . .blow them out of the water. -I said, time! Thanks, Bill. Bill, you make sure you take that $500 from Knox. Squeezed the cheap bastard up to $ 750. [CHUCKLING ] ''All gains or losses from wagers will accrue solely to the club. Hanlan agrees to use, praise. . . . . .promote Dr. Morse's Pills and Cherry Pectoralite. '' I think that's quite clear. ''Net purse money will be divided fifty-fifty between the club and Hanlan. '' Mr. Bainbridge here has drawn up the document. And, finally, ''The club will retain the right to--'' Good morning, gentlemen. Coffee? -You know my niece, gentlemen? MARGARET: Oh, please, don't get up. -I'll pour. KNOX: Where's Millie? The poor girl's coming down with something. -Go on with your business. -Yeah. Well, finally: ''The club will retain the right to arrange all details. . . . . .of any competition regatta we may see fit for Hanlan to enter. '' If you'll just sign at the bottom, Ned. -Excuse me, Muncie Albert. -Two lumps, Maggie. Don't you think Hanlan would be advised to have a solicitor. . . . . .to look that over before he signs it? I don't know anything about contracts, but why should the prize money. . . . . .be split fifty-fifty when it is Mr. Hanlan who's doing all the rowing? Really, Margaret, I think Mr. Hanlan is quite capable of-- I'm sorry, uncle, I didn't mean to interfere. It just sort of popped out. Um, maybe I should try to have a solicitor looks this over, eh? That was two lumps, uncle? I just came by to say thanks. I, uh-- Thanks. Why did you do it? Mr. Hanlan, if I saw a stray dog being kicked in the street, I'd try to help it. . . -. . .even if it was a scruffy, mangy. . . -Okay. -. . .un-housebroken, scrawny-- -I'm sorry I asked. Like to go rowing again, sometime? Like to go for a carriage ride? -Will you come and watch me race? -I did once. -It wasn't very edifying. -Oh, I can be edifying. Really. Just tell me what it means and I'll be edifying. Careful, you almost smiled. KNOX: Ned! Your new trainer has some activities planned for you now. -My new what? -Percy Collins. We've engaged him to take you in hand. COLLINS: There ain't no secret to it. It's just train, train, train. Listen, my boy. You may think you're the Blue Flash. . . . . .but as far as I'm concerned, you're just a piffle in the wind. Now, it's great to have a natural talent. . . . . .but there's a world of bloody difference between rowing to escape the police. . . . . .and rowing like a champion in competition. -I only won the biggest regatta-- -You won because you got a seat. . . . . .that gave you 50 yards on the bloody field. Well, now. Everyone's gonna have one of them sliders. . . . . .and they're gonna blow your loafer's oars off. [COLLINS CHUCKLING ] So unless you train. . . . . .unless you bust your bloody gut. . . . . .unless you put your mind on rowing and nothing else. . . . . .you'll never win another bloody race. So, what do you say? Sixty-eight, 69. . . . Just like a moving sculpture, isn't he? You've done a hell of a job, Percy. But is he ready for Boston? I hear this Trickett's a ruddy machine. I like Ned's chances. We still haven't seen what he can do when he really puts his mind to it. Keep that stroke up, Ned. BOTH WELL: No, not at all. I swear it. [BOTH WELL AND MARGARET LAUGHING ] BOTHWELL: Well, her face was a study. She sent him away with three of them, dear. I don't know, but she went to his grandmother's maid. COLLINS: Ned. Now keep that stroke up. BUTLER: Excuse me, Miss Margaret. This just arrived for you. It seems to be alive. [DOG WHIMPERING ] Oh. NED: Twenty-two. . . . . .twenty-three. . . . . .twenty-four, 25. [GROANING ] I'm gonna call him Rowboat. -Oh. So you like him. -I love him. Thank you. Cost me 20 bucks. He's a purebred. -You're not supposed to tell me that. -Oh, right. Well, it didn't cost me a dime. I found him being kicked in the street. Well, I guess I should let you get back to your training. You leave for Boston tomorrow? Yeah. Good luck. Thanks again for Rowboat. Won't you come with us? I can't. Besides, I'm not invited. I'm inviting you. With you there, I can't lose. Ned, please, listen to me. When my uncle was trying to convince you to join his business enterprises. . . . . .he said that it would help him if I could be nice to you. Go rowing with you, invite you to play croquet, lead you on a bit. Well, I guess I did and I'm really sorry. Well, I had that figured. I'm not as dumb as you think. Look, Maggie. I don't care about what you did. God, I've done lots worse than that sober. All I care about is how you feel now. All I've been able to think about is you. . . . . .wondering every day if I'd ever see you again. If I could ever. . . . . .I don't know. . . . . .mean something to you? -You do mean something to me, Ned. -Really? Yes, but-- I'm not so bad. I'm kind of reformed. I don't get drunk anymore. . . . . .to see how much things cost. At least not often, anyway. Maggie, what's wrong? I love you, really. -More than-- -No, don't, Ned. I'm engaged. I'm gonna be married. Who? Andrew Bothwell. Not that blond one. Why? Do you love him? Do you love him? Then why in the hell did you agree to lead me on? My uncle said that it-- It would give you support if I was friendly. That you needed somebody to-- No, no, he was wrong. I don't need you. I don't need anybody. [BELL RINGING ] HALE: When Trickett left Australia, he said you weren't fit to row with him. He beat Plaisted by 20 lengths. You think you've got a prayer? That's it. Ned will let his sculls do his talking. Now bugger off. Trickett will have him for breakfast. The little Bloke in Blue. Hello, Mr. Trickett. It's nice to see your face since I'll be pissing down your back on Saturday. [AUSSIES LAUGHING ] Twenty-six minutes, 1 2 seconds. Trickett was 25 flat this morning. But can he win now? Does he have a hope in hell? I wouldn't bet on it, gentlemen. Good Lord, man, we've bet 20,000 on him. KNOX: Twenty-five. Twenty-five? Look, AI. I can't afford to lose this. -You said to me that if the city-- -Oh, shut up, you sniveling hack. What's with that potato peeler of ours? He seems to have lost his spark. That niece of yours seemed to give him some spark. -Why didn't you bring her along? -Because she started to get soft on him. Why, I wouldn't know. Do you want him getting his hands on your niece? Twenty-five thousand at 3-1 ? I think I could bear it. COLLINS: Ned's been training hard. . . . . .but I can't seem to get him inspired. Now, gentlemen, he's not a poet. He's an investment that's going sour. The question is, what can we do. . . . . .to sweeten him up a little? [BAND PLAYING ] -Hello, Mr. Hanlan. -Dulcie? -Hi. You look great. You look gorgeous. BILL: Hey. Hey. -That's not on your training program. -Billy! You two got no idea-- You got no idea how glad I am to see you. -I mean, you got no idea. -I think he's glad to see us. I can't believe you came all the way down to see me race. Well, that, and it's a nice place for a honeymoon. He bought me the biggest diamond in the store. That's great. That's great. -I didn't know you knew each other. -You introduced us. -Oh, stupid fool. COLLINS: Come on, Ned. Stop the lollygagging. Hello, McCoy. Into the boat, lad. [WHISPERING ] We'll have a party. NED: Dulcie! -Ned! -Sorry, I'm late. DULCIE: Oh, it's all right. Where's Bill? He had to go out for a while, but he'll meet us at the Paul Revere Pub. [SINGING ] TRICKETT: Why, it's the Littlie Boy Blue. AUSSIE: He brought his sister for the shearing tomorrow. [AUSSIE SINGING ] -Hey, hey, break it up. -Cut it out. BILL: Come on, Ned. TRICKETT: Let's go. Take him over there, boyo. What's wrong with you? Take it easy. Don't waste your time with him. He'll get his tomorrow. His fat ass will be in the drink. . . . . .by the three-mile mark. Uncle Billy's taken care of things. You fixed Trickett's boat? -Why don't you tell the whole world? DULCIE: What's wrong? You think I wanna win the North American Championship on a fix? -I'll win fair and square or not at all. -Fair and square? -What is this, Sunday school? -I don't need to cheat to win, idiot. -You need something, boy. -The hell I do. I'm the finest sculler in the world. I'm the one that called you that, you-- You pompous little prick. You'd still be stuck in that louse-house hotel running booze with your pissy pals. -My pissy pals don't do this. -If it wasn't-- -If it wasn't-- -I'm going. Remember that. Knox was right about you. He said you were a smalltimer. You don't understand what rowing for a big championship means. And he does, eh? Who do you think paid me for that little job? Grow up, Ned. Grow up. Dulcie. Dulcie! Damn it! Damn it. I come to wish you luck, Mr. Trickett. May the best man win. He will. COLLINS: To hell with him. Let's go. AUSSIE: What are you doing? -You got a screw loose. The hell. They're as tight as a-- -Hey! -You better check those, Mr. Trickett. I don't want no excuses this afternoon. How the hell did that happen? The bloody screw broke. Where is Knox? In town. Putting more money on Ned. MAN: Mr. Edward Trickett, Australian and North American champion. Mr. Ned Hanlan, Canadian champion and challenger. [WHISTLE BLOWING ] MAN 1 : Five hundred. MAN 2: The odds? MAN 3: A thousand dollars bet 2-1 . MAN 4: All right. -AI, AI, we're in trouble. MAN 5: Five hundred dollars. MAN 6: 500? That's an awful lot. MAN 7: Three hundred? MAN 8: Give me 200 on Trickett. MAN 9: Trickett? MAN 8: That's right. MAN 1 0: Bill. MAN 1 1 : Hey, go shove yourself. -What are the odds on Trickett? -Favored, 4-1 . Thirty thousand on Trickett. -Pa, they're pulling. -Too late. They're pulling. Hey, Neddie, pace a bit warm for you, sport? You want me to ease up so you can fix the race again? SPECTATOR: Pull, Ned. Pull. Take a stronger backside. BO Y: Pull! SPECTATOR: Go! Come on, Ned. Put your back into it. BO Y: Pull. Pull. SPECTATOR: Go. Hey, Neddie, Neddie. Try using both arms. Don't embarrass yourself. Hey, Neddie. Come on, fart-catcher. That little blond tart I saw you with ain't gonna uncross her legs for a loser. You bastard! [SCREAMING ] NED: How do you like that, fart-catcher? Foul! Foul! Foul! MAN: Sabotaging and then ramming your opponent's boat is unforgivable. Rowing is more than a mere sport, it's a training ground for life. It brings out something fine and clean in a man. I firmly believed that until yesterday. . . . . .when we had the misfortune to witness. . . . . .the most flagrant and unsportsmanlike act ever seen. . . -. . .in 50 years among rowing men. -Here, here. I've taken into account the mitigating circumstances. . . . . .of your background and education, or lack thereof. But I am charged with upholding the principles and character of a noble sport. Therefore, it is the unanimous decision of this committee. . . . . .that you, Edward Hanlan, be barred from all races under our jurisdiction. Namely. . . . . .the United States of America. For how long? For life. Ned. Ned, you're home. [MAN SINGING ] WOMAN: We're with you, Ned. [ALL SINGING ] Thank you. WOMAN: You're home. We still love you. MAN 1 : We're with you, Ned. Forget those bastards. You're still our champ, Ned. MAN 2: To hell with the States, Ned. -Thank you. MAN 2: We still love you. [KNOCKING ] All right, all right. Hold your horses. I'm coming. -What the hell--? -Hello, Walter. Famous champion. -So Knox dropped you like a hot brick? -Trickett's his boy now. He even got Bill as his manager. Ah, what the hell? I wasn't cut out for that way of life. Knox is a bum. You're well out of it. -Sure is good to see you again, Walter. -Me too, boy. Me too. I want another go at that bugger, Walter. -Trickett? You think you can beat him? -I know I can. That wasn't me out there in Boston. My mind was fouled up. Listen, Walter, because of the ban, I can't race here in the States. But next year. . . . . .what about England? The Thames, for the World Championship. If I win there, fair and square. . . . . .no ban in the world would matter. I just need your help. -To do what? -To train me. To coach me. You know all the tricks. -I can pay you. -Pay me? Hell, boy, I'm gonna be rich. Fat rich. Some toff's already offered me 50,000 for the patent on my sliding seat. I'm gonna hang on to her. I got orders stacked to the rafters. That little darling's gonna keep me in clover till I kick the bucket. Damn it, Walter, I know I can do it. I know I have it in me to be the best. I just can't do it alone. I need your help. I raced once. Oh, yeah. Practiced, dreamed. . . . . .rubbed my backside raw. I even won a race or two. But I would've hocked my grandma for half the talent you've pissed away, boy. So when do we start? Thank you, Walter. Keep that up. You're doing good. Keep it up. Keep it up. Come on. Come on. Clean, boy, clean. I'm sorry about this, sir. The colonel gave explicit instructions not to admit you. Oh, it's okay, William. What's on going on here anyway? Oh, the colonel's having the place spruced up. . . . . .for Miss Margaret's wedding on Saturday. -Saturday? -Yep, it's gonna be quite an affair. WALTER: Scratch our back, colonel. We scratch yours. I own the world champion, Mr. Brown. My back doesn't itch. Trickett? You haven't made a dime on him in six months. -He's never lost for me. -No, he wins by half a mile every time. You can't lay no odds on him no more. Last race there was hardly any betting at all. What if I offered you a chance to lay as much as you wanted on Trickett. . . -. . .at even money, maybe more? -I'm listening. WALTER: Let him race Ned. -Ned? [KNOX CHUCKLING ] He's banned, finished. Maybe you hadn't heard. In the States, not England. I'm talking about the Thames, colonel. For the World Championship? I'll sweeten the pot. Let Ned row and I'll lay a side bet with you. Just you and me. The patent to my sliding seat. Worth 50,000. It's yours if Ned loses. You know, that's quite a noble offer, Mr. Brown. Just what is it about this Ned Hanlan. . . . . .that inspires such selfless devotion? I wouldn't expect a man like you to understand it, general. No, no, no! -Do not marry this man. -My fiancee has no wish to speak-- -Swallow it. Please, listen to me. -Get away, now. Away, I say. Stop, stop! Stop the carriage! Stop it, I said. Ned? Ned? Ned. Ned, are you all right? Ned, listen to me. Please. Don't marry him, Maggie. I'm the one who loves you. Me. -Not him. -Damn you. You scared the life out of me. Don't do it, Maggie. He's a wet goose. He takes two hours to get dressed in the morning. He'd bore you silly. He's going bald, Maggie. He uses Dr. Morse's Magic Hair Promoter. Bald and boring. Stop it. What's the matter, Maggie? Are you afraid? BOTHWELL: Margaret. Please. I see one thing hasn't changed about you, Mr. Hanlan. Obviously, you still don't bathe. Oh. I'm sorry. Terribly sorry. God, man, there's a lady present. Barbarian. I love you, Maggie. -Drive on. NED: I love you. Maggie! I love you! Didn't say no. Didn't say yes. Gonna keep us waiting until tomorrow. Where the hell's your shirt? [BOTHWELL AND KNOX LAUGHING ] BOTHWELL: Edward Hanlan lives. KNOX: That's right. Brown burbled on about Hanlan's great. . . . Anyway, I wanted more detail. But Brown, he is a chore. [BOTHWELL LAUGHING ] KNOX: It's a good opportunity, Andrew. I told Brown we'd build up Hanlan's chances. The odds would take care of themselves. BOTHWELL: I can see that. KNOX: Offer him a little bonus. BOTHWELL: What? KNOX: Ten thousand. Now, if you tell all. . . . Ned, wake up. Ned, wake up, damn you. Ned, listen to me, I overheard my uncle and Andrew talking tonight. I couldn't hear exactly what, but it had to do with you, Walter and the race. . . . . .and they were laughing. I don't know why, but I don't trust them. -Please be careful. -How did you get here? I said what I had to say. I gotta go. NED: Maggie. Your hat's too big. [MARGARET CHUCKLES] Stay. Brought you some breakfast. Thank you. -Well, now I know what it's like. -What? To be compromised. -Would you do me a favor? -Yeah. -Compromise me again. -Hmm. [KNOCKING ] KNOX: Ned? -Oh, my God. It's my uncle. NED: No, Maggie, back here. But I can't-- No, Ned, wait. My clothes. KNOX: Oh, there you are. Oh, nice place. -I want a word with you. -Here? Now? Yeah, here, now. -Why? What's wrong? -Nothing. Fine. Talk. KNOX: Now, I've considered Brown's proposal. -The English race is on. -Good. Great. Talk to Walter. No, I prefer to negotiate with you. I don't think Mr. Brown is gonna like my first condition. -It'll be fine. -You have to lose. -Lose? I'm not going to lose. -The condition is not negotiable. To make it a little more palatable for you, however. . . . . .I'll guarantee a rematch. . . . . .in writing, to be rowed fair and square whenever you like. -I row to win. -You row to lose. I'm prepared to provide an additional incentive for that. In fact, 1 0,000 additional incentives. Okay. -You agree? -Sure. -You agree to lose the first race? -Yes. Well, that's. . . . That's very sensible of you. Surprisingly sensible. It's all right. I think I just may have underestimated you, Ned. NED: Guess so, AI. We'll contact England and begin arrangements for the first race. I'll have my man, Bill McCoy. . . -. . .look after all that. -Okay, bye. -Oh, Ned. -Yes? I'd suggest that you don't mention any of this to Brown. He might just take a slightly old-fashioned attitude. . . . . .toward this sort of business arrangement. Bye. [ORGAN PLAYING ] [MEN CHEERING ] Everyone look at the camera. Ready, good. Go. KNOX: Christ! She married him. You know that she threatened to tell I tried to bribe Ned. . . . . .if we didn't give our consent? Then he sends me back the 1 0,000 with a note. A bloody note saying, ''I row to win. '' -That pompous, pretentious little prick. -Would you like me to cancel the race? Are you crazy? I've signed contracts. I'm heavily committed. Trickett's got to win. Ned'll give the Aussie a good run for his money, but I doubt if he'll make it. Trickett's too damn good. Relax, colonel. I don't relax. And I don't take chances. Ten thousand. That would butter a lot of beans for you, wouldn't it? Of course, if you won't take it, someone else will. That's what I find so reassuring. . . . . .about human nature. [BELL RINGING ] To the Thames. -The Thames. -The Thames. Well, you're going into the history books with all the great ones now, Ned. Chambers, Kelly, Renforth. . . . . .and now Hanlan. Here, here, lad, drink up. Excuse us, Margaret. I made a little wager with Knox. I bet my slider on you, boy. -What? -I'm telling you that now. . . . . .so you'll get it into your head just how much I believe in you. I know you're good. Tomorrow you're gonna know it. By God, tomorrow they're gonna know it too. [MEN LAUGHING ] [CHATTERING ] Walter, you old coot. How the hell are you? I'm all right. Ned, good to see you. How is everything? What do you care? Come on, Walter, let's go. Ned. Good luck, buddy. If you don't win, there's always tomorrow. Gonna win today for my friends. [CROWD CLAPPING ] SPECTATOR 1 : Hanlan. SPECTATOR 2: Attaboy, Hanlan. I shall say, "Are you ready?" once. And hearing no denial, I shall say, ''Go. '' Are you ready? Go. SPECTATORS: Pull. Go. Come on, pull. -Come on. -Come on, Ned. SPECTATOR: Come on, pull. [SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] MAN: Look at that. -Have we got a wrench in the bucket? COONEY: No, I don't have any. -Come on, Ned. -Come on! Come on! That's it. Keep going. -Come on, Ned. SPECTATORS: Come on, Ned. Oh. -Bill, did--? Did you--? -No. Shut up. [GRUNTING ] For God's sake, man, quit. -Will you look at that man? -What does he think he's doing? Hurry, Bill! Come on! Go. BILL: Go, Ned. Go. Go. -Come on. -Go, Ned. -Come on. -Come on. -Come on! -Go, Ned! TRICKETT: Well, you'll have to turn blue before you beat me, boy. You won't make it. You little bastard. When this is over. . . -Trickett, try using both arms. -. . .I'll punch your head in. [CHEERING ] [HORN BLOWING ] Thattaboy, Ned. [CROWD LAUGHING ] Hail to the champion sculler Toronto 's manly son Who crossed the line And on the Tyne -Hath famous victories won MAN: Shut up. -Hello. -Hello, Ned. DRUNK FRIEND: Ned! -Thanks, Bill. -Yeah. -See you. -Okay. Cheerio, Dulcie. COLLINS: Come on, Ned. DULCIE: Ned. [BELL RINGING] Got a message for you, McCoy, from Colonel Knox. Ned, help! Ned, it's Bill. Knox's men are beating him up. Oh, that bastard, Knox. -Ned, please. -Oh, here we go again. You take the two on the left. [NED CHUCKLING ] Subtitles by SDI Media Group
