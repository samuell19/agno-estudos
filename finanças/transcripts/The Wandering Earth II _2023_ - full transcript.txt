Humans are essentially a bunch of electrical signals. Your perception of this world, Your memory, is all getting into here, Right through this wire. Yes, Right here. Screw it! I'm not escaping. I don't care any freaking problems 100 years from now. This is not my problem! This is the technology keeping human civilization alive. I'm building a new world! Why is it forbidden? Your body is fragile. It gets hurt. It gets sick. It gets old. It dies. It gets freaking depressed. The digital you Can live forever, Theoretically. At first, Nobody cared about the disaster. It was just another wildfire, another drought, the extinction of a species, And the disappearance of a city. Until one day, it became relevant To everyone. You know, Back then, in this place, you didn't even need guns. You missed the good old days. This street Was not like this. The night market rocked. “”It was known as the "Little Northeast" of Africa. Barbeque stalls everywhere. It's fine. Patrols. The mosquito pie. About this thick. 500,000 mosquitos in one pie. Delicious. Can't even have mosquitos anymore. We're here. This is where they are. I brought Peiqiang to see you. Your kid has made you proud. He passed the examination for China Reserve Astronauts, And they're sending him To the Moon. He's doing training here. Rest assured. I'll take care of him. Is there really a Solar Crisis? You are going to be blind. There must be one. Otherwise, what's all this fighting for? Anyway The Earth will be engulfed in a century And the Solar System will be gone in three. End of story. What else can we do? Gently. Do you think You're ready for the Moon? You'll spend More than ten years up there, maybe twenty. Great. Then ourfamily will be Reunited up there. In any case, Earth isn't that great. Being alive is pretty great. Silly kid. Just remember To hang in there. Steady! Steady! See that? That's the first test engine of The Moving Mountain Project. It will be completed in less than six months. Six months? Can it be done? You know what? We can even Build these engines on the Moon. No Humans needed, All built by machines. Non-stop, fast. As long as no one tries to sabotage the construction, Six months should be enough. "Attention. ATC10171ATC10171 is entering D2 AA inner circle Mark D2. Please confirm. IFF check pass. Stand down: The Sun Is rapidly degenerating, ®and expanding. In 100 yearset the Sun will completely Engulf Earth In 300 years. The Solar System will no longer exist. To cope with the Solar Crisis That will arise in 100 years, The general assembly has decided that the UEG is hereby established. Dozens of plans for dealing with the Crisis were proposed. To ensure the survival of more people, The Moving Mountain Project was eventually selected. 1 The project aims to construct 10,000 Earth Engines, To propel Earth away from the Solar System. Three Lunar Satellite Engines will also be constructed 1304175Litmane1227to exile the Moon, Eenabling Earth to break away from the Moon's gravity to start its journey.134187J1223 To verify the feasibility of the Moving Mountain Project, 33 countries co-founded The joint experiment bases in Libreville and on the Moon's Campanus Crater. However, As the project progressed, As the project progressed, the difficulty and high cost of its implementation have intensified the impact on the interests of all parties around the world. Doubts, Opposition, and conflicts. Escalate day by day. Another armed riot broke out In the suburb of Libreville. UEG has sent peacekeeping forces to quell it. Their equipment is getting more advanced. There must be state-level armed forces behind it... The solution to the Crisis has become a crisis itself. The feasibility verification of the Moving Mountain Project is now a matter of utmost urgency. This is First Avenue. We have been attacked. I repeat. We have been attacked. This is UEG Avenue. We have three officers injured. Calling for backup. Location: UEG Building. There's been an explosion. Requesting for backup. The Headquarter was attacked. Be careful in Philadelphia. Okay. Just a minute. I think the Digital Life supporters did this. They should never have banned the Digital Life Project. Sorry. Do we know the number of attackers? I don't give a damn! Just send someone. Sorry. I don't give a damn! From 53 countries. As of now, There are 17 reports of damage on the UEG HQ building; The United Nations Avenue has 13; First Avenue has 21; 5 on East 43rd Street; 74 on East 44th Street. I'll cut to the chase. This attack on the UEG is an indication “ that people have lost interest Fin the project. We advise postponement of the Moving Mountain Project. Mike, I don't think that's a good idea. The hour before dawn Is the darkest. We advise Pushing the project forward, Withstanding all distractions and disruptions. Complete the verification as soon as possible. Don't forget, we only have a 13-month window. The Sun won't wait. CNZHANG PENGI'm telling you, I'm telling you, it's dangerous out there. Try your best to get in. Don't fall in love.

Mr. Secretary, Ladies and gentlemen, Merely 4 hours ago, the Space Elevator suffered a carefully planned and organized terrorist attack. As of now, the death toll stands at 3,521, With a further 5,137 injured. This is the largest terrorist attack Aimed at the Moving Mountain Project Since the attack on the UEG Headquarters 3 months ago. This attack has directly caused severe delays In the Moving Mountain Project. This means we will not be able to complete in time the verification of the feasibility of these projects. Mankind's countermeasures against the Solar Crisis Are increasingly likely to be terminated. We reserve all rights to take further action as appropriate. We are confident in our ability to protect our homeland And the safety of our citizens. The space agency replied, We have seven months. Seven months. Xiaoxi. Mr. Zhou.

That's just a photo from space that's Voyager looking back at us. I believe. So will my children. And their children, too. By that time, I believe the reunion under the blue sky, When the blossoms Hang from every bough. Now, what do you think you should do? I will convey this to my President. By the way, Completing the feasibility test for the Moving Mountain Project, In just seven months, is quite doubtful. But, good luck. Seven months. Two engines. Only us. This is not fair.

Canada's geological exploration is completed. Construction of North American Engines will officially begin. 550The quantum computer 550 series 550Cbased on 550C, is being developed with An Engine private network with higher computing power. According to a new round of surveys, For the first time, public support for Moving Mountain has overtaken that of Digital Life. The last of the Space Elevator attackers are now on public trial. Which marked the end of the Digital Life Project. You brats. I'll show you What a natural born astronaut looks like. As the Space Elevator is being rebuilt, The UEG begins work on the Navigator Project, to provide early warning for the Moving Mountain Project. Europe is handing over authority so that 550Cmore 550Cs can be used For construction. Sooner or later, We will be replaced by these things. Full automation Has replaced a great number of industrial workers. During the past 14 years, 550through self decision-making And automated construction, The 550 series has helped us Build 5,321 engines. The Underground City Sortition Program COMwas passed at the UEG general assembly today Chinese representatives protested strongly Against the fairness of the Program. The Sortition Program is seriously against the original intention of the Moving Mountain Project. Only half of the global population Will have the opportunity to enter the underground cities. As the Earth rotation gradually comes to a halt, We will switch from the 24-hour time system To a 60-hour one. The surge in solar radiation Has led to an explosive growth of cancer around the world. We experienced hardships. We've given resources, And time, even life. At the same time, we achieved Mutual assistance and unity. Get lost. Don't let the robots take our jobs. Look at their suits. Sooner or later, they will be replaced. Welcome to the Sulawesi automated construction base. 550C550W, an upgraded version of the quantum computer 550C, 550W enters offline testing phase. It's estimated to build the control network for Earth Engines globally in the next ten years. It's alright. No big deal. I can go do the navigator interview. Our son will then get a spot too. I hereby invite everyone to safeguard The unity of mankind. Please allow me To solemnly announce On behalf of China, The Moving Mountain Project is now officially renamed as: The Wandering Earth Project. In the past 28 years, There have been 9.1 billion Cyber attacks against us. 7.9 billion of these were made 2044 in the year 2044 alone. In January, 0.3there were 30 million cyber attacks. Over the past several months, We have seen the infrastructure of New York City UEGand UEG Headquarters Damaged beyond repair. And in March this year, There were 4.4 billion attacks. The Space Elevator was also attacked which resulted in the fall of the Ark Space Station. APEFRENng 11116STTCARLOn the lunar base, the life support And early warning systems were disabled.

Sit down. Any reply on the Moon's backup plan? Some countries raised objections And didn't sign the document. A major controversy is The donation of strategic nuclear weapons. I'm worried that it will end up like 14 years ago. Take strict precautions And get ready for a backup plan. In my estimation, the key Is the beans itself. Now there are many exceptional beans that Come from places like Sumatra, And uh...even Katmandu. When the Moon is too far to be seen, they'll probably cancel the Mid-Autumn Holiday. I'll be okay as long as we have mooncakes, Especially meat-stuffed ones!UEG-SCO are you sure you're talking about mooncakes? Northerners! People don't see the Moon of yore, Yet our Moon once shone on the ancients. The Moon will always stay in the memory of mankind As we pine for our homeland. As the Lunar Exile Project initiates, Once again, Let us give our best wishes to the Moon. One big watermelon Cut into two halves. Half to you, Half to Mommy. Come here, Come here. One, two. Go ahead. These are for you two. I'm taking mine with the phone, so I can edit them later. Mommy is going to edit the pictures! I want to do that too, mommy. Wait till mommy's done. Let me do it, mommy. Let me finish first. I want to edit them, too. In a minute, alright? It's okay. Mommy, I don't want to anymore. Don't be scared. Liu Qi, don't be scared. It's okay. It's okay. Don't cry. Don't cry. I know what you're thinking. Do you have any idea how many people around the world Won't get a spot? And can't enter the underground cities? Do you know how many people would kill for your spot? You should feel relievedlCPL That Yaya doesn't live in a world like this.CPL Although global Internet has been shut down, LIGNO COO550Wthe 550W retains All types of network interfaces. 550W The moment you connect Tu Yaya Your spot will be cancelled immediately and you will be sent to prison. What about my daughter? I haven't seen her in 14 years. Yaya is dead. That's the reality. Yaya is not dead. I don't agree with your opinion on Digital Life. I've waited 14 years. I am already old.planning ability Even if I go to the underground cities, how many more 14 years will I have? Daddy. I want to have ice cream first in the amusement park! Well, would you like to have a strawberry Or milk flavored one? I want the biggest one, The one that's taller than me! Let's have one of each! It's always mom who eats them in the end anyway. Mommy's teeth will fall out. What are we gonna do? 550Wif Yaya can be successfully connected to 550W, it would be a milestone in creating Digital Life. There, She will have a complete life. And your name Will be written in history. Initiate Yaya, and you will die. De-nothing. And you will live. Your choice. Navigator interviewees pay attention to the numbers called. Do not linger in the hallway. Major Liu Peiqiang, This is the Manned Orbital Space Station Operating System, 550Wthe offline version of 550W. Quantum size 8192. The most powerful computing hardware in human history. According to prior evaluation, All your flight records and exam grades were impeccable. I believe you have a great chance to work at the Navigator ISS. Thank you. I've longed for space ever since I was a kid. I hope I can roam in space on behalf of mankind. To understand each other better, I'm especially interested In your first impression of me, Why do you have only one eye? I have two different answers. The extremely humorous one is: It's easier to focus with one eye. So I can have a better look at you. Hahaha. This humor is... Just right. The official answer is: ToF this is my ToF radar unit, which can activate all networked devices and collect Multi-angled data on the target Including biological indicators And relevant information. For example, You are married With a son. Your wife was diagnosed With Type II Radiation Sickness 3 years ago, Inducing LAM Syndrome recently. Under such circumstances, the best option for you Is to back out of this selection to look after your family. It's always been difficult To honor both loyalty and filial piety. Please note that, While answering the following questions, You are forbidden to use metaphors, :rhetorical questions, Or implications. These type of communication could cause serious accidents In the Space Station. I'm very sorry to leave my family behind, but it's what I have to do. “”By "what I have to do",A Do you mean you're forced To take this job? You clearly know everything already. Why are still you doing this? Second warning. You're forbidden to use metaphors, rhetorica questions, or implications. I got a spot, But my wife and son didn't. Once I'm selected for the Space Station, My son will be covered by the preferential policy and my wife Can enter the underground cities with him As the guardian of a minor. I just want my family to survive. Daddy. What about the other family member? What do you mean? Major Liu Peiqiang, Your father-in-law, Mr. Han Zi'ang, Didn't get selected in the Sortition, either. What about Mr. Han Zi'ang? Time's up. Your best option Is to have Mr. Han Zi'ang as the guardian And let him take Liu Qi to the underground cities. Based on your wife's current condition, 84.3 Cher life is to end in 84.3 days. Damn you all! You have failed the stress response test. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Go to No.19. I'm sorry. Can I try again? You didn't pass the examination. I was too nervous at the interview. I'm not usually like that. Please. This examination... is important to everyone here. Don't affect them, okay? I really need this opportunity. I really need it. Everyone has one chance only. You have a secret mistress on the Moon, or something? You're so eager to see it go. He does, actually. They went to college together. Nonsense. Not that one. Which one's that? You know what? The Moon is pushed away every year by like, what, 10,000... 10,000 right? 10,000 kilometers.INN That'll be a long wait for you. Everyone listen up. Stay calm And keep order. It's very cold. ”Stay in line. There's enough for everyone. Hold on to your cards. Alright. Thank you for your cooperation. We promise you That everyone Will get their share. My child has a fever. Can you please switch places with me? Come here. I'll switch with you. Those in the back, get in line. Your turn. Comrade, What are you doing? Please stay in line. Everyone's waiting.

This is just the result of iterative evolution. This is merely your poor understanding Of Digital Life. It actually proves that YYYaya is alive. She's gone and that's it. YYYaya only has 2 minutes of life, I want to give her a complete life. You've got a spot in the underground cities. You still have a long way ahead of you. Live in the real world.

I'll keep it steady. Liu Peiqiang, Do you think you are riding a bike? Go faster. Peiqiang. This way. Are you doing okay? When I was little And when I couldn't sleep. I would sit here and look at the Moon. I don't think I'll make it. I've made up my mind. If you don't get selected, You should go down there by yourself, and go on living. If you do get selected, Then we'll have dad take our son to the underground cities. The spot will be wasted if I take it. When the time comes, don't let me go with those pipes on me. Peiqiang. Don't be afraid. I'm here with you. Always. The operating system for the Lunar Engines has been overwritten. The breach bears resemblance 2044 to the Space Elevator attack Back in 2044. 550WWe tried to rewrite the OS with 550W, But its access was denied. Who did this? Who the heck did this? Do we still have any staff on the Moon? Robots. Warning! Lunar 2 Satellite Engine's exceeding normal power level. Stand back! I'll say it again. Your acts of protest Have seriously interfered with the operation of New York Earth Engine 01.POLICENY 《》 According to Article 551, Paragraph 5 Of the Wandering Earth Act... Xiaoxi, Are those seagulls? I have never seen one of those, ®Mr. Zhou. Earth's rotation has been stopping for so long, How did they survive? I'm already in the building. You got it, too? I hear something is wrong with the Moon. Run!! Watch out! Recall to active duty! Look, Daddy! The Moon just lit up! This puzzle is too hard to be solved. “Extreme tidal could be incoming if it changes the lunar orbit. Residents in coastal regions Shall seek cover on high ground. Understood. Come have a look! It's an emergency! Dear, take a look at this. What's going on? Did you hear what's happened? I heard about the explosion. I told you. Dude, we're so dead! The Moon is falling! We're so dead! Now, Lunar 2 Satellite Engine is gone. Lunar 3 Must remain functional. ICSST] Images from CSST have been received. Broadcast it.VER-OCCAMINTE It wouldn't be so bright, If it was a shutdown. But based on the current data, We can only do such judgement. Lunar 3 has exploded also. The Moon is off its orbit and crashing down to us. We have an estimation of 221 hours remaining. Less than 4 days. What are we waiting for? Ignite the Earth Engines now! Earth will be torn apart, If the Engines ignite when the Moon is still there. Not to mention one third of the Engines Are still under construction! So there's nothing we can do but to wait for death? FRANCChina will be opening up all its underground cities To maximize the survival rate within our territory. Young lady if we let them all in now, They'll simply settle down and never come back up. Wait and see what happens when the food runs out, We will all starve to death. We are informing you of our decision To open up our underground cities, not seeking for advice. Salute! You don't need to go through the Sortition anymore. You now have immediate qualification To live in the-underground cities. After I leave, You'll be Liu Qi's sole remaining guardian. This is the only way To ensure that both of you can survive. That's enough. I'm sorry. Temporary crew members, Welcome to the Navigation Platform ISS Please report to Docking Hall No.4 at your earliest convenience. Temporary crew members, welcome to the Navigation Platform ISS. Please report to Docking Hall No.4 at your earliest convenience. How have you been? I'm fine. Mr. Zhou, The image you requested is ready. It's about time. Mr. President, Delegates, ,and friends from around the world, What you're seeing now Is a piece of fossil from 15,000 years ago. 8It's a human femur That recovered from a fracture. It marks the dawn of human civilization. 15,000 years ago. A fractured thigh bone was often fatal as it deprived you of your ability To find food or seek shelter. All you could do Was to wait for a predator to eat you up. SPAINHowever, this particular femur healed.SPAIN It meant that after the injury, Someone took care of the wound, Someone provided water and food, Someone protected this person From the predators. This kind of support Solidarity Is how we survived till this day, And made our civilization last. [20]44Back in 2044, after the successful experiment of the Lunar Exile Project, We proposed a a backup plan. Create a Lunar Surface Nuclear Array Using the world's nuclear arsenal. To trigger nuclear fusion in the Moon's core Till it collapses and disintegrates. Delegates from 33 countries in attendance, have received The same message as I did. It's the exact inventory Of the world's nuclear arsenal, And it happens to be the same as what we need To trigger nuclear fusion in the Moon's core. These numbers were once top secret, But now they are meaningless. I don't know the source of this messsge, Nor its intent. But it seems That someone is reminding us, After 15,000 years, till now. We are dealing with another fractured femur, is now placed in front of us. Will we make the same choice That our ancestors made 15,000 years ago? Your spot in the underground cities has been withdrawn. It's okay, Mr. Ma. I have proven that I was right. Does it matter? It matters a lot to Yaya. Now that Yaya has gained a complete life no one knows if she'll turn out to be an angelor a demon. Mr. Ma, No need to worry. Time will tell... There's no time. The Lunar Exile Project has failed. Earth must set off immediately. In order to control the Earth Engines worldwide, We need to restore the Internet. 408Since Earth's rotation stopped, sea water has submerged the rootserver in Beijing, FORMATIONSIGNATURE /making it extremely difficult to rebootGENCY ACTIVATION MISSIONTEAM Why me? According to the logs, The Lunar Satellite Engines overloaded 1.7just 1.7 seconds After Yaya's upload. Somehow I don't think it was coincidental. I suppose I can Decline? I don't think you will. Our mission is to place nuclear bombs on the Moon. Step forward if your name is called. Peter Walsh Here! Neil Drofa Here! No worries. It's already arranged. Liu Peiqiang! Here! Didyoul do this on purpose or what? It's based on their flight exam results. You don't get to go even if you want to. We'll see about that. I have to go. My son is still on earth I need to be stationed here. Need to be stationed here The countermeasures against the Lunar Crisis include 3 stages: Stage one, transfer the entire nuclear arsenal To the Moon via the Space Station. Arrange the bombs Inside the Campanus Crater, 46km in diameter; In a phased array. Lunar debris has formed an asteroid belt. The Navigation Platform ISS Will maintain in high orbit. All nuclear weapons are packaged, counting 3,750 in total. Standby for delivery. All personnel designated for delivery, prepare for departure. The mission has to be accomplished before the Roche limit is breached. Stage two, Connect all the nuclear weapons. Use the Space Station as a relay satellite ויוויfor remote detonation. This triggers nuclear fusion in the Moon's core causing the moon to collapse in on itself- Don't talk to me about redundancy. Get away. I can't magically pull 3,000 Engines out of thin air. The control center has received encrypted data Provided by the nuclear states. For remote detonation to be executed, All data has to be sorted and decrypted To connect all the nuclear weapons. Nuclear files have arrived. ALL MEASPlease make serial connection ASAP. Thanks. 550W550W has been connected to the decrypter. These files may have been created 19452045in anytime between 1945 and 2045. Different countries used Different cryptography in their creation. GIO UFO-It would normally take at least a decade To decrypt all these files. Yet we only have half a day to figure out how to connect them all to a single wire. Stage three, restore the root name servers in Dulles, Tokyo, ( and Beijing. This is to restore Internet connectivity And ignite the Earth Engines worldwide, So that Earth can evade the lunar debris, and embark on a new voyage. All of the 7,000 Earth Engines- Have opened their network ports And ready for Internet connection. Inform Advance Teams in Dulles, Beijing and Tokyo to set off. The task of bringing the root name servers back online has begun. After the nuclear bombs go off, We only have 30 minutes to start the Earth Engines. We only have 30 minutes to ignite the Earth Engines. Any longer, we won't escape the debris. The private network for Earth Engines Hasn't been built yet. The only way to start the engines is to bring the Internet back online. You'll need this key to restore the Internet. The password consists of 30,000 randomly generated numbers. It's the essential piece to enable access to the Internet and connect all the Earth Engines. Once the Engines are connected, 550W 550W will rewrite their operating systems To standardize the ignition command. I've brought you what you asked for. Thanks. Benben. These are waterproof sprays. They can form a thin coating on the surface of objects Thereby making the object highly hydrophobic If you have any more remarks to make, you should write them down now. No, thanks. I don't know whom to write to. Sync them up! Check the equipment. Underwater docking cableve has been installed. Contact the commanders. We're ready to go. Mr. Zhou, They have finished assembling the world's nuclear arsenal. We have 12 hours before the Moon falls. The rain has stopped. Let us begin. The number you have dialed cannot be reached. Most of the satellites Have been destroyed by Moon debris. I tried to call my daughter. But it didn't go through. Don't worry, I got you. I'll take care of you.

It's still missing one last set of key. Remember, A civilization without people is meaningless. The Moon is approaching. Don't push! There's no time. I bet you know it's really hard. All the warheads are of different models, From different times, And different countries. Get to the point. How much longer do you need? The warheads on the Moon are all set. We still need 714 hours. Humans. We used the most sophisticated safeguards on mutual destruction. There is one other option. This is a mechanical detonator for a nuclear warhead. And trigger. There are 81 models in total. We need 219 people for this operation. However, to guarantee our success, I call for 300. Our docking modules are not landers. Are not landers. So basically I can only offer you a one way ticket. Russian ones are without safety. We've got two triggers. I'm in. What are you looking at? The Moon belongs to us. There's no way I'm handing it over To kids like you.

Look at you, how are you all grown-up now! 2058 it's the year 2058. You are Tu Hengyu, member of First Advance Team You are Tu Hengyu, member of First Advance Team Of the Emergency Respond Group. Use the global Internet host key to ignite the Earth Engines around the world. Save the world from imminent doom. That's the reality. Who are you to define what's real and what's not. 127 F2037Recorded in 2037 Your own backup card hard drive. I thought you had drowned. Daddy, come here. Just then I really thought you had drowned. It's OK Daddy's here. I'll always be here. There's no time. Turn the countdown off. The Moon won't fall for another 3 days, Ignition or not we are gonna die! Turn them on. Start as many Earth Engines As we can. Are you crazy? We die if we ignite them now. God help us. ImgJingo home now. Engine network failed. The Earth is done. I don't want to die here. I'm going home now. It's time to address the world. Chief Commander. Excuse me, sir? The mission has failed: Time to go home. Fire the Earth Engines When the countdown ends. Our people Will definitely accomplish the mission. Thanks to your people, ▶ the root server in Beijing is still not online! If we fire now. It will tear the Earth's crust apart. ATIVEWe still have one last chance To be with our families. But igniting now is suicidel Let me say it one more time. Fire the Earth Engines when the countdown ends. Security! Toss this man out! Ignite the Engines. Ass.carpinter.netThat's the end of the key. Daddy, hurry up and save the world. CE, CAS Daddy, hurry up and save the world. Le's do it together. Ignite now! If we succeed,UEG/LECC don't forget about Yaya. What have you done? Will definitely 0390375F4F411260270accomplish the mission. Daddy! Global Earth Engines network established: Dulles. Overwriting operating systems. We're back online! The Earth Engines have been successfully ignited! In about 40 minutes, lunar debris will skim by the Earth. I believe The courage of mankind Transcends time. It transcends the past And futures And future. I believe our people Will definitely accomplish the mission, real or virtual, at all costs. I believe The reunion under the blue sky, when the blossoms Hang from every bough. The tidal waves have calmed. The tidal waves have calmed! Did we save the world? I believe we did. Daddy's going to take a nap in a big box. When you Can see Jupiter without binoculars, Daddy will be home. Look at all the stars Around me, keeping me company. Goodbye, Solar System. The 24 hour system is back, I'm glad. Heaven is round and the Earth is square. They sure are an interesting bunch. They even designed souvenirs. Madam Hao, A speech of such importance, Are you sure you want me to deliver it? Every speech here is important. Just read it, word by word. In the past seven years, We have finished the construction of the remaining 3,000 Earth Engines. Marks the completion of all Earth Engines and underground cities. It also marks the 7th anniversary Of the victorious conclusion to the Lunar Crisis, And 7 years of unprecedented solidarity among mankind. Starting from today, we are officially entering The Slingshot Acceleration Stage. During the first acceleration period, 2065starting from 2065, we will undergo 10 years of acceleration around the Sun. As for the second period, 2075starting from 2075, Earth will fly by Jupiter 2and this will give us the final boost. At this historic moment, allow me to solemnly Reannounce the 5 Phases of our Project. The Quarantine Project has been enacted. The best we can hope for now Is to keep the AI And the automation equipment On the Navigation Platform International Space Station. Every decision made by AI Will first have to go through Security Council's 5 permanent members. will expend 15 times the world's total GDP, GDPor around 10 quadrillion CNY, To construct 10,000 Earth Engines to propel the Earth and 10,000 underground cities for humans to live in. This is a particle tracking image DUDEfrom the DUDE Lab's neutrino department. The accuracy is getting better and better. If everything goes according to plan, by that time we will be passing Jupiter. In the second phase, Torque Engines encircled along the equator will fire To stop Earth's rotation. We'll break free of the Moon's gravity And the Earth's orbit around the Sun, ,taking the first step towards leaving our Solar System. Someone's helping us. Phase three, Earth will change its orbit, swing by the Sun and Jupiter and on both occasions achieve slingshot acceleration. Thereby embarking on its journey of wandering. Phase four, As Earth leaves the Solar System, The Earth Engines will be witched on to full power. We'll spend the next 500 years accelerateing to 0.5% the speed of light, Followed by 1300 years of glidi period, Followed by 1,300 years of gliding period, after which We will reverse the the Engines' thrust, And spend another 700 years decelerating. Hmm, you've got a beard now. It looked better on your Chief. I'll get you a razor as a gift. Lieutenant Colonel Liu Peiqiang, please head to the hibernation chamber immediately Best of luck. 550W 550W doesn't sound like a proper name But if you flip it around, You get MOSS: Like the flowerless plant. Cuter, isn't it? Now is this the official answer, Or the extremely humorous one? It's MOSS's answer. Will mankind survive? ®Looking through human history, ®the fates of civilizations Have always been dictated by the choices men make. I choose hope. The final phase, 4.2 Earth will reach its new orbit in Alpha Centauri, 4.2 light years away. As a new member of the star system.RIA The project will span 2,500 years. The project wil span 2,500 years. One hundred generations will partialpate in this magnificent intergalactic voyage. The project Is known as the Wandering Earth Project.
