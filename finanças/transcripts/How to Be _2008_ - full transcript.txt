[ Music ]. I just never got anything they were trying to do for me. What they were trying to do in general. I mean, once my father made me collect up all my toys, you know, like, I. mean, mansion toys from my bedroom. He took me downstairs and made me burn more in the garden. Yeah, I mean, he must have bought the stuff for me anyway because I was only about six. I mean, I just didn't get it. Every day. Constant, contradictory. That certainly seems like a pretty heavy thing for him to do to you, Art. But I don't know why you're telling me this now. I just thought you ought to know something about my childhood. Something about where it really came from. And then maybe reconsider. But this is about us. Now. It's just not working. When we first met, you seemed so elusive and brooding and intense. An enigmatic poet. What I took to be deep and mysterious has just turned out to be really sad and unhappy. The sun scored by the fire. I'm joking with us. Life is a stage on which we will play. The world is a symphony of sarcastic lust. Light be a part of the global game. But I'm left behind choking on dust. Choking on dust. Choking on dust. Choking on dust, choking on dust. It's not finished yet. It's a work in progress. [phone buzzing] Hi. Hey, honey, it's Art. Come in, you two. Who's that? I just feel like I'm going through some kind of quarter-life crisis. Arthur. Could you go over to that deli and get me some things? Why? I've been looking over there and some of the delicatesseries look delicious. Why don't you go over there yourself? I've been using this new Internet home delivery. So where are the features? Let me see. As you go over there yourself. Yep. London is perilous, Arthur. Oh, yeah, this is for that CD you lent me. They're not very good, are they? Why... First off, he is not a they, apart from session musicians. Oh, right. And I obviously like him, otherwise I wouldn't have lent you the-- What? I obviously like him, otherwise I wouldn't have lent you the CD. What? So why are you saying that? What? You're such an idiot. Do you think I should go into therapy? No, Jesus, why would I think you needed to go into therapy? It's cognitive. Therapy was invented in the '60s. Do you know what invented means? It means it doesn't exist. Well, what am I supposed to do then? Do your music. I am. I just had a gig. I told you I had a gig the other day. Gig, gig, gig, gig. Do more music. We should do some music. On the computer? Yeah, well, yeah, me on the computer, you on the guitar. It'll be good for you. It'll be a new thing for you. We could form a band. We could form a band that I could get Nicky Fierce to come and play some drums. Who's Nicky Fierce? Do you remember Nicholas Dwyer from school? Yeah. He changed his name. Nicky Fierce. Nicky? Yeah, Nicky. I don't know. It may be drums a little bit too loud for my acoustic sound. They're electronic drums, you're half-wit. We could make them as quiet as a mouse. It'd be like fusion. It'd be like electronic fusion. Electronic music. Electronic acoustic. Electronic digital. Come on. Do you want to do this? This is a good thing for you to do. This is the worst part of things for you to do. Should we start this band? Let's start our band. Should we do a jam? Should we do one jam? Let's do one jam. Should we do a jam? Should we have a jam? Should we have a jam on Tuesday? Should we have a jam on Tuesday? Tuesday. Should we do it? Tuesday. Come on. Tuesday. Do you want to do it? Should we do it on Tuesday? Should we have a jam on Tuesday? Exactly. Yes. Yay! Real heroes. I don't know what I've been told. Parents love us awful cold. Instead of night jump, they just scold. I'd like to find a way to break away. I just wanted someone to comfort me, you know, just to ease my anxiety. Right. But I'm still really anxious. Yeah, well, we all have to die out. Yeah. I know that, Jeremy, but... I just feel so unhappy all the time. Yeah, so you keep telling me. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I just feel so unhappy all the time. Yeah, so you keep telling me. Look hard. I mean, you've got to remember, you don't actually have things all that bad. I mean, there are so many people in the world who are hungry or oppressed, and, you know, they do anything to be in the position that you're in. I know. That's why I'm voluntarily giving my time to help the community. Yeah. Look hard. I can't help feeling that maybe your main reason for coming here is, you know, to make yourself feel good. I mean, this is... It's quite a... Quite an unthreatening environment, wouldn't you say? I have absolutely no idea what you're saying to me. (GENTLE GUITAR MUSIC). I just don't feel that I'm ready for this kind of commitment. No, you're not ready for this kind of commitment. You can't do this to me. I don't understand why you care so much all of a sudden. As long as if you've paid me any attention so far. Look, we're not breaking up. Yeah, we are. I'm adopted. There's folks out there. They're not my real parents at all. Well, that might explain why they hate you. They don't hate me. So what happened to your real parents? They died... in a house fire. And where were you? I was staying with my grandmother. She had cancer. She was painted with a... cancer brush... (CLEARS THROAT) ...psssh, tumour. You're lying, aren't you? (LAUGHS). Yes, yes, but you... A little bit. But, erm... you made me. It won't take long to make your stuff out, Willit. What? Willit. (SIGHS) Everything you should talk to someone. About what? Your family... your parents... it is not normal. Listen to what you're saying, Art. (SIGHS) Um, I'm so sorry. I... I'm gonna take this. I'll be right back. - Arthur? - Mom? I don't know how you knew to call me here. My own dad at the uni, he was busy, sir. He told me to call this no matter. But how did he know? I don't know. You don't know? No, I... I don't know. No. Now, neither do I. I've moved back in for a while... back home. I know. How did you know? Well, it was just a matter of time. Look for yourself. I've got another job later on this afternoon. I don't know what time it's gonna finish. Look, I really gotta go. Um, please? Try not to make a mess of things. Life is a stage... on which we all play. Don't... The world is a sun... the sky's still a last. I'd like to be a part... of the global game. I need you all to know... I'm choking on dust. I'm choking on the dust. I'm choking on dust. I'm choking on the dust. I'm choking on dust. I'm choking on dust. I'm choking on dust. I'm choking on dust. I'm choking on dust. [music]. [music]. [music]. [music] [music] [music] [music]. [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music]. [MUSIC PLAYING] Can I come read with you? Yes. I suppose so. I'm reading this book by the Sky Doctor, Levi Ellington. I'm just going to sit here, then. [MUSIC PLAYING] So this is what makes you happy, then? Sitting and reading, I suppose? No. No, not really. [MUSIC PLAYING] Great car. You're going to love it. Fantastic. 3A performance. One minute gearbox. We'll tell you about the airbags. Who needs airbags? Red line, stay the white side of that. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Your Uncle Jerry's money? You spent your Uncle Jerry's money? I just wanted to do something good with my inheritance. Your father won't be at all happy. You're always saying there's something wrong with me. So now I'm going to get fixed. I wonder at you sometimes. [MUSIC PLAYING]. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, bastard. You know, what I love most about you, Arthur, is your naivety. [BUZZER] Licky? What the fuck happened to my city? [BUZZER]. It would probably be advantageous if you could escape from structures. What do you mean structures? [BUZZER]. Well, consumer structures. Society structures. Just trying to escape from the consumeristic materialistic missiveau, you know, buying ego cars. Ronnie? Arthur? Art? Yeah, my nitrous oxide. Oh, yeah. Oh, wow. That's funny. Now, just try and find some easy peace. How? Well, don't know. Your own way. Alexander technique. Organic sleep. I mean, you could sleep, motherfucker, for the start. Sleep. Sleep. Those little slices of death. How I loathe them, to quote Pope. No, you just got that from the beginning of Nightmare on Elm Street 2. Well, it's the beginning of Nightmare on Elm Street 3, but I knew it anyway. Whatever. Look, the whole thing is about women, OK? Women, yeah? OK? And if I share a few of my powers of my wisdom. and offer them to you, then getting laid, it might actually seem like a possibility. Not so much for you, you know? Yeah, I was just-- I was thinking of something a little bit. Yeah. I like what you're saying. Tai chi. Yeah. Yoga. Lesbianism. Scrammick shoes. I've done all that. Look. The best thing I would do would probably get reborn. It was amazing, the whole thing. Hilarious. Yeah, I had a similar experience, actually, when I was driving on the motorway between Leeds and London in a Van. And I stuck my head out of the window for about 45 minutes. I used to get myself pretty bad cold. Yeah, good one. Tommy, do you actually like yourself? Yeah. Really? No. Oh. Me, you, London, come with me. I'll open your eyes. Um, why don't you come with me? No. I have a balance of self already. And I also think I'm probably getting a migraine. Thing is, I have this way different approach to life than most people, OK? Like, you ever heard of that dude needs me? Right, he had this amazing philosophy. Basically, you say, you know, you go around London, and you stick your dick in anything, you know? And the whole world just loves you for some reason. I can't figure it out, but it totally works for me. I'm just so unhappy. I just don't care about that for some reason. I'm not sure. Why is it different how you were at school? A minute. I was a geek. But check me out now. It doesn't matter. You can be like me, yeah? You just embrace your freedom. If you did something mental now, like got an old lady, told her to, like, she's stupid or something, or ring this doorbell. Ring this doorbell, yeah? And then we'll leg it and just go mental in London. Ring the doorbell. Come on. Don't be a cunt. Ring the doorbell. Ring it. And ring it and one with me. You'll be hilarious. You've actually done that. What? Are you just stupid? What? I'm just running away quickly. Idiots. You're an idiot. I appreciate the gesture, Nicky. Um. I mean, what do you think about things like therapy, self-help? Oh, that was close. Real close. Keep watching. Just sort of motivational stuff. I'm going to go now. No, no. One more. Watch this. Check it. Check it. Watch it. [GUNSHOT] [SOBBING] I've had a thick health. I've had a thick health. [SIGH] Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. I feel so much better. Well, I'm going to go now. Hmm? No, no. Go on. You're staying with me. Want to make a call? Yeah. We need some famina and indulgence. You with me at this, my friend? You with me? OK. Hey, kid. Hey, look at me. Hey. Hey. You all right? Come on. Give me a smile. Give me something. Hmm? Tonight, I'm like the karate kid, yeah? You are my protege. I'm going to teach you every single move, yeah? Train you up, yeah? You know everything. Yeah? Yeah? Doesn't that make me that karate kid and you, Mr. Miyagi? Don't be a part of this, by the way. But they're coming, OK? Follow my lead, yeah? Do as I do. We've done right. No can defend. No can defend. What am I doing? Just don't be yourself. Don't be yourself. Don't be affected. Do what you've done. [LAUGHTER] [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGHTER] Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. [LAUGHTER]. I've never had such a good time. Oh, no. [INAUDIBLE] What is that? [LAUGHTER] [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGHTER] You girls are saying what tonight? You're turning me on. You're turning me on. [LAUGHTER]. Turning me on. [LAUGHTER] I've got an erection. [MUSIC PLAYING] Thank you. I love these. [MUSIC PLAYING] What did you put in that? Cheers, Pepsi. [LAUGHTER] [INAUDIBLE] Trust me. OK, come with me. Shim over there. [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] [MUSIC PLAYING] And legs. She's coming as well. [MUSIC PLAYING] [INAUDIBLE] [MUSIC PLAYING] I don't know. [INAUDIBLE] Can I just show you while-- [INAUDIBLE] People typing on my computer. I want to show you one thing. [INAUDIBLE] You're such a-- [INAUDIBLE] Let me show you one thing. All right, but you're not going to pay for that computer when you bust it. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hello. I'm Dr. Levi Eilke. Perhaps by now, you're aware of my latest book, If Not Your Vote. [MUSIC PLAYING]. Sometimes we all need a little help. And with my new revolutionary systematic approach, you too can say goodbye to niggling doubts of the years. Be more at ease in social and family gatherings. [MUSIC PLAYING] Be more loving and communicative in your purpose. [MUSIC PLAYING] Have better job prospects and make more friends. [MUSIC PLAYING]. Set realistic goals and achieve them. One more and lead less. [MUSIC PLAYING]. With yourself, cloying thoughts that you disappoint in your merits. [MUSIC PLAYING] Have free time. And make better use of your ambition. And most of all, you have to understand everything. [MUSIC PLAYING] Are you sure you know what you're doing? Yeah. It's a macrobiotic, low glycemic index meal. Sounds very scientific. Yeah, apparently it'll detox our livers and make us more calm and communicative and stuff. Arthur, try not to make a mess or electrocute yourself. Please don't wear your sunglasses and doors. You look ridiculous. I wonder about you sometimes, Arthur. Why don't we have proper meal times like other families? Your father and I are very busy people. You've had a perfectly normal and satisfactory upbringing, and you know it. I suppose so. In my parents' household, meal times ran like clockwork and was downright oppressive, and I never felt the need for us to live like that. Why are you smiling? I've got a surprise for you and Dad. Don't say that, dear. [DING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER]. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Mum, Dad, this is Dr. Ellington. He's come away from Canada to party. The party stands for pragmatic, analytical, relationship therapy exercise. He's going to make me be more normal. Very, very famous. Very, very successful. I'm really looking forward to getting to know you when you're close. It must be so satisfying to know all these deep, complex problems, these psychological problems that you're trying to relieve you. I think it's amazing. It sure is. Tomorrow's going to be an extra, especially exciting day out. He's leaving the house. Where are you going? You haven't even had your breakfast yet? Not hungry. What are we going to do, something for family? Maybe at the weekend. Saturday. Saturday, right on Wednesday morning. I don't understand what you mean, Arthur. We could go to the cinema. Or for a walk or something. Why? It's like a family activity or a bonding experience. Oh, that sounds a little forced to me. What do you want to do? Haven't you already planned this? No. Um... I think we should go for a walk or something. Fine. Look, do you mind? I really got to get to work. Okay. Now, Arthur, what I need you to do is to show me the areas in the house which have either a happy or an unhappy, spatial memory for you. Visualize a time and a place. How did you feel? I feel like I'm in a situation where I'm not going to be able to see. I'm not going to be able to see. I'm not going to be able to see. I'm not going to be able to see. I'm not going to be able to see. I'm not going to be able to see. I'm not going to be able to see. I'm not going to be able to see. I'm not going to be able to see. I'm not going to be able to see. I'm not going to be able to see. I'm not going to be able to see. I'm not going to be able to see. I'm not going to be able to see. I'm not going to be able to see. I'm not going to be able to see. I'm not going to be able to see. I'm not going to be able to see. I'm not going to be able to see. I'm not going to be able to see. I'm not going to be able to see. I'm not going to be able to see. I'm not going to be able to see. I'm not going to be able to see. I'm not going to be able to see. I'm not going to be able to see. I'm not going to be able to see. I'm not going to be able to see. John Chubb is art. He and his parents used to live in this house. Okay, right. As part of an intensive therapy program, it is essential that art finds his mental space within a physical space. What would you like to see? Well, statistically, most traumatic experiences take place in the lower portions of the house. Can I go see my old room? Oh, where's the place? I've seen this, the room opposite. Is this your room? Can I come in? This used to be my room. That's the window. That's the garden, isn't it? Did you live here before us? Yeah. This is so strange. It just seems more spacious, but it's actually smaller than I remember it being. It was exactly where my bed was, but it was over there, and it was different. What kind of vibe did you get from this room? Did you ever get the feeling there was a kid who used to live here who was just very unhappy? It's probably not like that now, though, is it? Could you get out of my bed? I wish I was you. Why are you here, Art? I just wanted to talk to you. About what? Just talk. I don't know what you mean. I'm sorry, but I don't know what this is about. Well, um... I guess that's what I'm here for, too. Would you excuse me for a minute, Art? [door opens]. Um, Jessica, uh... Would you say the way your parents treated you has made you treat me? What are you doing? These are the kids' loos. Why are you in here, then? Did you say your parents loved each other? Get out of the toilets! Did they? Please! Did they love you unconditionally? Oh, no, your parents divorced me. What's this book up? What isn't it more like? Um... Well... Before? Did they argue much before? Don't try and draw me into this. It's over. Hey, shut up in your face! Art, don't do that. I've got a jam session later on. Uh... Just working through some ideas. Uh... You know, composing and expressing myself. Music. I think we need to try to achieve a set of conciliatory, objective, future-focused, introspective, and nurture. Or coffin, if you will. Is he with you, Art? Just listen. What do you got to say? I don't think we should see each other any more in any way. Well, I'm not totally happy with things. I don't get on when my parents saw that well. Please, don't do this again. What? Did you see what I did with those letters? See, oh, and then... Yeah, yes. Yeah. Wait, hold on. We kick it out with something like this. It's that kind of intro thing. Sounds like an electric didgeridoo. You kind of join in. I'm playing your chords, so just join in when you're ready. Play E. Play E. No, then no E. Do you know how to do single notes? Play A. What's E? E? This one, E. Arthur. I don't know how to do it. Play a C chord. We move. Play E. Play whatever you want. No, no, do you not have three wheels? No, only three wheels. ♪ Squiggle, squiggle, squiggle, squiggle ♪ ♪ Squiggle, squiggle, squiggle, squiggle ♪ ♪ Squiggle, squiggle, squiggle, squiggle ♪ What key are you playing? I'm not playing keys anymore. I'm giving you loads of golden opportunities to join in. Play your thing. Can you hear stuff? Come on, that's an amazing guitar line. ♪♪ [ Beeping ]. I thought of something that might appeal to you, Ronald. Do you know what iPod stands for in my system? Individual, personal, observational, discernment. In your system. That's right. Now tell me, can you dig that? Arthur, can I speak to you for a minute on the roof garden? [ Beeping ] Jesus. Look at this place. Yeah, 50 million single women in London. Keep your eyes on the prize, my brothers. Our eyes on the prize. I think I'm gonna go home. Well, I call it my home base, no. Yeah, well, why don't you move out? Join this place. Yeah, well, my dad. My dad pays for it. It's in my dad's name, but I'm just gonna pay him back when I get a job. I think it really is time we were going now, Arthur. How are you? I like to make a habit of being clean and in bed by 10.30. [ Pause ] [ Pause ] [ Pause ]. [ Pause ] [ Pause ]. How did you get in? On door. When? Hmm? Before any of you woke up. Was that normal night then? Got hungry? You didn't close by. Get over it. Okay. Uh... Thing is, Nicky, uh, I've gotta go to work in a second. Uh, this care center thing I work at sometimes. Um... But if you want to do something today, I'll cancel it. Figures show that people who are intrinsically motivated. gain a greater sense of satisfaction. and in turn, greater self-esteem. Self-esteem? That's good, right? Okay, uh, are you gonna be okay by yourself? Polygophon. I'll make myself busy. Go ahead. Work hard. And I'll see you later. All right. Okay, bye. Oh, it would have changed. This is disgusting. Tell me. Would you say you had an untidy mind? Yeah. Yes, I suppose I do, yeah. Come on, I'm dominating. There's one against all of you. It's like chess. It's like chess, you know. You gotta think it through. You gotta think about the move before he does it. Yeah, yeah, plus or back, plus or back, plus or back, plus or back. How do you feel things are panning out with this game here? Gareth. He's very straight-laced. I mean, when we were doing the disco, you kept putting a damn bill on things that old times. Gareth's one of the senior organizers here. That's his job. I know. I don't care how liberal you guys are, but sometimes people need putting in their place. Are we talking staff or residents now? I don't know. You tell me. I think you're trying to fog things now. The fact is, after today's embarrassing episode, I think we've really got to ask some questions about you working here. Yeah, good, do. But I want my personal therapist here during any formal discussion. You've got a personal therapist? Yeah. Um... Listen. Why don't we just forget this whole thing happened and get back to what we're supposed to be doing here, which has got to be worth a whole lot more than this hunk of junk. Ah! Art, I'm really sorry, but you just can't work here anymore. I'm a volunteer. What I'm giving you back your free time... Pricks! Pricks! Don't do that. Jeremy is a backstabbing prick, and I hate them all. And Gareth, that smiling, smug, self-satisf... He knew I wasn't very good at my job. I baked a cake, Art. Things are getting worse, not better. I think I'm passive-depressive. Now don't let's get morose. Don't be hesitant to look inward if it will provide reward. Part of self-esteem is well-being. How is your physical fitness? Um... Self-self. Right. Three times around the block. Okay. (SINGING). (SINGING). Look, I decided I don't want to work here anymore. And I've got a lot on my plate at the moment. And I'm more interested in other stuff. I've got a degree. So I just want to spend more time concentrating on my music and finding my core. So I quit. I resign. If you think of a problem as an unknitted Jigsaw puzzle, try to imagine the fragments of your lifestyle are the individual pieces. Now, when they lie scattered in the box, they may seem random. But remember, each piece has its place. They will knit. So if the picture that the puzzle makes is of a mountain, you'll know what it is you have to climb. In summation, an unknitted puzzle makes for a cluttered mind. Now, Art, I hope this session has made things clearer for you. This weekend, with your parents altogether, we'll redefine the parameters of what is possible. This is it? This is the grand ness grave? A little here, at this point. Looking right at it. So how's your career in the supermarket progressing? Okay, it's not really a job anymore. Um... I guess I was just biding my time, just trying to let my music develop, which incidentally my friends are saying sounds really interesting. I dumped all that voluntary stuff as well, just to ease the pressure. All the time for jamming, composing. Do you have any realistic career options? I've got a gig next month. Do you want to come, Dad? No, I don't really think I can. Bye. Well, I'm very busy. When are you? No, I'm very busy too. What, all month? Yes, now can we please drop this? I find it incredibly offensive that neither of you give me any support in anything that I try and do. That's not true. I give you a lot of support. I give you even more if I thought you were doing something of note. In fact, not even that. Just something that didn't make me feel such disappointment. So that's what I am to you then, just a disappointment. You know what I mean. No, I don't know what you mean. What do you mean? Stop being so babyish, Arthur. I wonder about you sometimes. Where did your father go? Don't stop touching everything, Arthur. This is not a playground. My father told me I was made in the garage out of plasticity. No, no. He told me if I wasn't to become a more manageable child, that he'd mow me into one. And that terrified me for years. For years, I was always on edge. A joke, Arthur. Were you so babyish you couldn't see that? No. No. No, no. Jokes. Jokes! I just disguise the forms of aggression. Positive presence, Arthur. Come on. What are you doing? (SIGHS). (SIGHS) (SIGHS) (SIGHS) (MUSIC PLAYS) (MUSIC PLAYS). Arthur, your father and I have decided enough is enough. I'm afraid Dr. Ellington will have to move out. What? No. No. It's only to start it. Why don't the two of you get a flat somewhere together, and you can ruminate on your problems all day? I couldn't even if I wanted to, could I? I spent all my money getting him over here and getting a car. Dad? Dad, why don't you say something? Arthur, your existence is an oxymoron. What are you saying that for? I think that you have so many contradictions going on in your head that you just can't think in an undeviating chorus. Both of you always criticize me at school, but you never help me, not once. You see, this is why we're calling this to an end, because this is turning out to be nothing but a series of bitter recriminations. dressed up as therapy. Well, you would say that, wouldn't you? Oh, good night, Arthur. Good night. Is that all for you? No. Mates. (GENTLE MUSIC) Hello? Ronny, it's Arthur. It's that time again. It's that time again. Don't stall with me, not tonight. One, two, three. Can you stop it, please? No. It's my flat. Yeah, well, I no longer have that luxury. You're preaching to a Saint in the know, Arthur. That's why I've got this pad. Yeah, because your dad doesn't want you living with him and his new girlfriend. Your point being... Look, at the end of the day, I'm fully self-sufficient. Did your dad pay your rent? Did he pay for my computer? I don't know, did he? Stop trying to analyse me, art Garfunkel. You're not a counsellor. Why are you even here? I just saw it. (BEEPING). It was that early. Just throw it. Can you do that one more time? Hey there, buddy. Oh, wow. Hi. Nice to meet you again. Why are you wearing a suit? You mean to a funeral or something? Hmm? No. Peacock there, my friend. Dressed or impressed? Guys love this bullshit. I don't know why. They despise them. Following up, I faint. I have to walk all over them. Live my life. Get a shadow in the wind. Okay. Who? What are you kids doing tonight? They used to stay here. No, let's just go out. We are out. We're on a roof guard. We're practically indoors and there's only us up here. Don't be like this. It is fine. Ronnie, you never go out, so... You never go out. So let's just go out. Why don't we just stay here and watch a film? Look, I'll get you both hot girlfriends, and I guarantee you that bullshit. Ronnie, I'm gonna go out for a drink. Why don't you come out with me? You got a drink problem. No, I don't. I just don't usually drink. You've got a serious drink problem. Face facts. Ronnie, you've got a drug problem. Are we here for you or are we here for me? You're coming out with me, Ronnie. I think I'm probably getting my drink. No. I think it's good. Ah, hold it. I didn't mean to do that. (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR OPENS). (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR OPENS). You know, I wasn't always like this. Well, I was a very happy child, and in actual fact, I was pretty popular. But I became increasingly worried about heart attacks, and I asked my dad if kids could get heart attacks, and he said they probably could. (LAUGHTER). I think it's the work coming. It's good to see you. I can't... I was thinking about... I mean, I didn't know. Do you think it maybe could have worked? I don't know. Sometimes I just looked into my hair a lot after a guy had him. Just to spend a lot of life. Yeah, a little admiration for him. It's really systematic, the shore approach, and he really believed it would work, and when I just didn't do it. It's like me, I've got loads of structure. It's like I go, and I'm all over that. What do you mean? I mean, you've got structure. What does that mean? You've got a webpage, which actually should check out, because it's got loads of bytes, but it can't be achieved. It's a thing. I really think we should do this music, I mean... I think we could be really good at it. I think it could be really good. We could almost just consider it like the art. We could do it like our main thing that we do, like our biggest thing in our lives could be that it's bad. You know? You've got to focus. You've got potential. I know, I think we're really talented. I think we're really good. I think we saw Jessica as an area earlier. Forget it, man. Make you wish to serve. It doesn't matter. Serve those waves away from that girl. I want to be your bad woman. She's so annoying. Take your own life and forget about it. What? Take your own life and forget about it. That's the same. That's what they say in films. You're upset about a girl, you say, "Take your own life and forget about it.". Take your own life. That's the advice. You need to go back up there, take his position. Right. Well, because he wants to go over this... - How about that girl? - Yeah, yeah. Have a good time. Have a good time. - Imagine... - Don't do that. - Imagine... - I mean, look over there. - Jessica... - Forget it. - I'm leaving. - Actually, don't do that. And do you know what? She's with the guy. - What's your problem? - Yeah, she's with the guy, you know. Break him down. Break him down, my friend. Break that down. Break him? Break him down. Break him down. Move over. Why? He considers himself an Alpha man. Go to there and deposition lies in the rationale. Rationalize him out of the Alpha man. You go back here, then. Yeah? You take that out. Well, yeah, yeah. You sort of out with burgalization. I think the bomb must be there. I think everybody does. You've got one of those faces that you just want to hit. Do you think we should go? Excuse me. Hey, Jessica. Jessica! Oh. Hi, Art. How are you doing? Yeah, I am pretty good. Pretty good, yeah? - Good. - Art, this is Dave. Hello, Arthur. Nice to meet you. - Musician? - Yeah. Musician. All right. - I want you back. - That's not gonna happen, Art. All right. You're me. You're me. Love each other. We're just two souls looking for something... Mm. ...disconated. - Up. - Depressed. - Up. - No. That's not true. I'm perfectly content. I'm really quite happy at the moment. Hi. ( music playing ). Listen, Arthur, you should come down to the club night. We've got a couple of mates. We've got jazz stuff. I play sax. I've got two mates. One's a drummer, one's a double bass player. We've got a lot of standards. Two guys I met out on the Patagonian Trail at my gap year. I know it's about a university. But I'm bringing guitar down by some guitar. I don't know whether you play jazz or whatever, but you don't want to play. You can just sit and watch us. It was a nice place to have a beer. Spanish beers, French beers. All those cloud-eaten sweet beers. All that kind of stuff. And then after seven, they served food. A lot of kind of Mexican stuff. You know, like nachos and tacos and guacamole, all that kind of stuff. It's good stuff. You can just sit and watch the music. What's munching on some snicky snacky snoo, you know, just having a good time. Why? Why? Seriously, I think it's better to... Embarrassing, because I don't know what you're speaking to. It's just a calm day. Embarrassing yourself. I don't know why all these people are here. Embarrassing yourself in front of me and the lady as well. If you want to let go, I think it's best if you do, because you clearly have too much to drink, all right? Yeah. (music) (music) Afraid I'm gonna get hit. (music) (music). (screams). (music). (music). (music). (music) Hey, Dad. Yeah, what? What are you doing? Arthur, what is it? What's wrong? Nothing's wrong. I just feel that we've never done anything like this before. What odder trouble? No. Apparently, sharing a space like this is a design of unconditional... Ugh, I suppose you were guided towards this mystifying gesture by Dr. Ellington. Both of you are quite clearly non-compasementous. Well, what if he's right? It's you with the problems, Arthur. You've always been an awkward child, but is this necessary? Well, I think we should be more affectionate like other parents, so, uh, yeah, I guess that it is. Well, don't guess, Arthur. Don't guess. Because this notion is perverse. Now, get out of the bed. Okay. Don't shout. There's no... I've got to shout. It seems to get a word in edgeways with you, following any perverse, sordid idea that comes into your mind. I just wanted to talk to you. In our bed? No, no, the bed was a different thing. I just... Oh, nothing you are saying makes any sense whatsoever. The important thing here is why you should think. getting into your parents' bed will help in the healing process. You just told me to do it. Yes, Arthur. Metaphorically, get into bed as a metaphor. A metaphor? What? It says in your book... This is a horrible thing to do to us. I'm sorry. I didn't mean... It's a silly thing to do. Odious, repulsive and harrowing. I'm just trying to make... Oh, Arthur, sometimes I wonder about you, Arthur. What? Why doesn't he wonder at me all the time? You don't give a shit about me and you never have. Of course we care about you. What else are we going to do? But I love him properly and I'll probe his son. Arthur, you're being hysterical. You have got to stop blaming us for everything. Have you ever felt guilty about producing such a pathetic, useless child? Of course I feel guilty. I don't feel that went as well as it could. You give him nothing! I'm sorry. [whistling] [music]. [whistling]. [music] [whistling] [whistling] [whistling] [music] [music] [music] [music]. [music] [music]. [whistling]. [music] [music] When I die, is it the heaven, heaven, heaven, and the earth? Yeah, my dear. Now go to sleep. [music] [whistling] [music] [whistling] [music] [whistling] [music]. [music] [music]. My mum made me feel like trash. [music]. Always belittling. Like I could never achieve anything worthwhile. [music] Most of my parents did. I was always playing second fiddle to my older brother. Our idea of relating to each other as a family was points scoring against each other. We were always trying to catch each other out. One of the things that makes me the most uncomfortable about Arthur is that he reminds me of my older brother. He eats like him, he walks like him, he constantly demands attention and sympathies just like him. She said I'd never make anything of my life. I'd never amount to anything. [music] When I was about nine or ten, my father suddenly decided to take an interest in me. He decided that I was to read a book and then when I finished it, we would stand by the night in front of the fireplace and discuss our thoughts on the text. Those books were hopelessly inappropriate for a child of my age. From try as I might, I couldn't figure out what it was all about. I dreaded having my ignorance exposed to him, leaving him disappointed. But though I read those books over and over, humiliation beckoned. [music] [music]. [music] [music]. [music]. [music]. [music] Where are we going Arthur? I don't know, I don't know, where am I going? Where am I going? [music]. Shouldn't we be going back into the house now Arthur? I can't go back in there now. Why did you stick up at me back there? What am I going to do now? When have you been all evening? Have you been drinking? He doesn't say anything in your book about what to do if you've alienated everybody. If you've been drinking and you should not be drinking too much... [crying] Fine! This all may prove positive. Yeah? But since you've arrived, I've got fired and my family hate me even more. I had nothing to do with you getting fired, Art. And your parents certainly don't hate you. Well you haven't helped me at all. Well, maybe I can't. But you know how many people I have helped? There's a chapter within your book. There's certainly stuff in your family that needs to be worked through. Well I think I might go and learn, you know. Well, fine. That's all we are eventually, alone. If you're going to learn to accept that, you might be able to go through life without being so disappointed in everyone. Just try to be systematic in your approach. I'm going to sell this car. Get a flat. Going back to Canada then? Yes. Probably. [birds chirping] [birds chirping]. If you go down to Emma, you'll never come back. In my opinion, you're on the wrong track. We'll always love you, but that's not the point. If you go with that fella, get a bow to us, as far as I'm concerned. You can't be just throwing yourself away, not even trying. You're your enemy. Okay, well here we are. And I took two. There's a new toilet up there by Route 7. You can read these, no noise after 10, there's others in the house, no guests after 10. I'm not going to keep losing, don't lose it. Okay? All yours. Okay. Okay, thanks. [music] You're not exactly full circle, but you know what I mean? I just feel like I want to help people. That's great that you're thinking about others, but I mean, not at the expense of, you know. I'm trying really hard not to focus so much on myself, and I'd really like to try this again. I thought you would approve. Yeah, but the point is, I like this job. It suits me. I'm good at it. Frankly, I don't think you're cut out for this kind of work. I mean, I'm sorry if it sounds cruel, but... Just another destitute child of Thatcher's Britain, good for nothing. There is definitely something to you, Art. You've got a tenacious spirit. You just need to channel it and keep it in check. You've got to be on yourself. I mean, all that stuff you were involved in, that's got its place, but you do take things to extremes. I mean, this sounds too simple probably, but what gives you a buzz? What do you really want to be? [Music] Sorry I had to leave, but I just had to get away for a while. I hope you don't mind me saying this, Arthur, but I feel that your father. and I have been put under a great deal of stress and anxiety from the guilt caused by your upbringing. Thanks for telling me to get on. I'm really over all that stuff now. Well, yes, but it's good to try things. Your father told me to tell you if I spoke to you that I should inform you that he loves you. I don't think I'm going to be around for a while. I don't know. Maybe I'll see you at Christmas. You're not a nobody. You're somebody. One of the greatest songwriters has ever lived. They're all going to love you for it. Okay? Listen, you've got as much right to be out there as anyone else does. You all right? Yeah, I know. I know. Why don't we just go into it, okay? Yeah. Yeah, let's just do it. All right? All right? Okay. Okay. That was what I was going to find. I was drifting behind the corner and hanging with it. This is French-Hives. And the heat there. I've planted a great big cross in the sea. I was lost and I was found found dosed. It's a mystery to me. Oh, yeah. I've tried to push it out. My head's consumed my scrap. I'm the color we found inside and put it out to look inside the soul. And that's your cross to bear. Yeah. Yeah. Don't think they've got to be out inside. And I'm fine. Thanks for listening. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
