What do you think about our sleeping arrangements? You think the boss is strict? Regardless if the boss is strict or not, you wouldn't understand him anyway. Not to worry, relax. Don't think about it. At least we're here now. I'll just go to the toilet. Filipino? I'm going home. - Dado. - Hey. Last night, you were disgusting. You were farting all night. That's not me. That was Mervs. Ease up on those hot pot dinners, man. Have you heard the news about Carros? What about him? He's gone. What? - Vanished. - Vanished? Maybe he's ducking deportation. Why? What happened? What did he do? He missed curfew again. He's done after strike three. Later. Are you going to see Anna later? I've got a date too, with Celia. Celia who? From the club, last Sunday. The one in white boots. You got her number? Yup, I did. She actually gave it to you? Hello, Celia. Hi, it's Manuel. Who? It's Manuel. We met at the club last Sunday. Which club? The Copa. Come on... You talked to me. The name's Manuel. Ring a bell? I remember your name, but I don't remember your face. It's fine. There were some guys around you that night. You were mobbed by fans. Will you be at the Copa tomorrow? I'm not sure. Why? What are you doing after church? I'm not really sure. I may go to Wan Wan. Really? That's great. See you there. Why? No reason. I just want to talk to you, to be your friend. Your call. Who are you talking to? The kids wouldn't stop crying. The couple fought again. They kept on yelling at each other. You know how painful to the ears when the Chinese curse at each other. I hear you. What happened next? As usual, the boss stormed out, then Ma'am left with the kids. And that's why... I'm off tomorrow. What do you want to do? What about her? They'll probably be back by night. How sure are you? They better be. I haven't had a day off in two months. Where do you want to go? Let's go to Danshui. Danshui? You don't want to see your friends? No. Tomorrow, just the two of us. Okay. - Take care. - Take care. - Hey, sweetie. - Hello. Papa? How are you, baby? Do you miss Papa? I miss you, Papa. It's my birthday next week. Can I get a Barbie? Of course. I'll get one tomorrow. Let me speak to Mama. Brother, it's Jessica. Tina was taken to the hospital. - What? - I'm here to take care of Sabrina. What happened? I can do it, yeah. I'm gonna make it. Shit. Boss... Hey, moron... Moron? You again? Sorry, boss. - Sorry, boss. - Haven't I warned you about being late? How are we supposed to run this huge factory if everyone acts like you? Please. You're late. Sorry. Please... You know him? Carros? Betel nut... - Gin! - Again? Man, how come you always win? Come on, pay up. Where's Dado? He's on the roof deck. Who's winning? Who looks happy? He's a cheater! Now I know why we always lose. Hey. Were you late? Three minutes over. He wasn't going to let me in. Careful now, even if you're a second tardy, it's still considered as such. Did he write you up? A bag of betel nut took care of that. Tina was in an accident. What happened? A tricycle knocked her down. Is she okay? I think so. They say it isn't serious. That's a relief. You know what's missing here? A couch. A simple one would do. But it should be nice and classy. However, it should be soft and comfortable to sit and lay on. Right here. So when we get home from work, we can lie back, gaze at the stars, and just sip in my ice-cold beer... Delicious! That's exactly it is. Manuel... Wake up, or else, we'll be late. Bus! Hey, bus! - Manuel! - Hurry up! - Wait for us! - Catch up, Manuel! Did she say yes? No, but it was the kind of 'no' that doesn't really mean no. Do you get it? I don't. I played it real cool, got her curious. And I hung up first. I just said, "Celia, see you when I see you." It's all confidence. With women, we should take the lead. Where are you taking her? My dad always said, "To part a woman's legs, first fill her stomach!" I'm buying her a steak dinner. You're loaded. I've saved up. Just the two of you? Why do I have to take you? Steak dinners are expensive. I've never tasted the steak here. Fine. Come along. Taste it if you like. On one condition. Fill her ears with good things about me. You should tell her that... I'm kind, loving, those things... Dado? Dado? That's a bit sketchy, dude. Text from Carros, he's hiding out. - Where? - Near the church. We can run into him, if you're not busy. Manuel? Celia... New ones to let go... You're just faking it... You are my Only treasure That I can't Fully find The beauty That you've created Is a glimpse Of your magnificence Tina. Forgive me. Why? It's really my fault for leaving you all. Dado, we're okay, stop worrying so much. Nothing's changed here when you return. Are you okay now? Tina, is your waist still twenty-nine? Fool, why do you ask? Carros? Carros! Hey, it's that guy. There, he's looking for Celia again. Where is he going? Watch, he's coming back. I hope he doesn't come near us. Here he comes... Have you seen Celia? Celia who? - Do you know where she is? - Not here! Hey, someone's looking for Celia. Celia. Here you are. I'm Manuel. We spoke on the phone last night. We met at the Copa last Sunday. I've been thinking about you since. Celia likes mango ice. Really? Mango ice? The one on Ling Sheng North Road tastes the best. - Get three. - Three! Manuel, I just saw Carros got arrested! - Not now! - Manuel, hey! - Thanks, you can take it from here. - Sure. Where's Celia, the girl sitting here? She left. Where's Celia? Beats me. She's not here. I thought we had a date. Where is she? Don't take it personally, Manuel. - Hey, what about our Mango Ice? - Yeah. Here, I hope you get diarrhea. - What the hell? - Jerk! Suzie's got new earrings. A birthday gift from Jose. How about me? I think I'd like a new pair. Dado, do you think I should get one? Dado... Are you okay? You're not listening. Is there a problem? Sorry. Why are you so weird today? No, Anna. I'm really sorry. It's okay. What's wrong? Let's end this. Huh? What do you mean? Let's break up. Are you kidding? You're not kidding. Why? I can't do this to my family anymore. But you can do this to me? You can hurt me on my birthday? That's right. It's your birthday. I'm sorry, I forgot. It's fine... Anna! Anna. Grandma, wait here. You know what? You're an asshole! Asshole! Any decent man wouldn't do this. You couldn't wait? You should've let this day pass. Anna, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... Stuff your sorry! I wanted to be happy, on my birthday. For once, just today. I waited all day for you to wish me. We've been over this many times. I don't want this couch! If we don't get this, where are we supposed to sit - in our new place? - I've told you over and over. Red doesn't work in our new place. Anna called me an asshole. Celia made me look like one. I want to go home. Well, Carros is definitely going home. Wait. Anna called you an asshole? What exactly did you do? I broke up with her on her birthday. You broke up with her on her birthday? You knew it was her birthday? I forgot. Wait a minute. Let me discuss this with my wife. Why can't you wait? Don't smoke! - Can't you see I'm pregnant? - Please don't smoke here. Don't argue with them. Come, let's talk. Again. Are you sure you broke up with Anna on her birthday? You didn't know it was her birthday? Couch is expensive, if you leave it here... You think this couch is expensive, and I'm cheap then? No, I didn't mean that. Dear! Dado. Look. A couch. God is telling us something. Dado. Come, sit. Maybe it's damaged. Damaged? It's in perfect condition! They'll come back for it. You saw them leave it. Why will they come back for it? It's really nice. Why throw it away? Dado, let's take it back to the dorm. Don't look at me like that. Picture this. You're back from work. You're overly exhausted. So tired, you can't even tell you're tired. But it's all right, you have a beer in your hand. Taiwan beer, but it'll do. Ice cold! The entire rooftop to yourself... But something is different. Something new. A couch! Sit, go on put up your feet. Now, look up. Not bad, eh? Stars are sparkling. You ask yourself, "If that's heaven I'm looking at, then where am I? Or, if I'm already in heaven, then what is that I see?" You done? Dado. Let's take this baby home. Do it yourself. Come on. Don't tell me you don't want it? You know you want it. Manuel, how do you plan to take it back? This is it. Nice, three thousand. That's too much. Gas is expensive. One thousand. Tell you what, since we're friends, two thousand. Cash, up front. Do it. That's two thousand. Okay, here's the deal. I'll give you a thousand now, the rest next week, on pay day. You're giving it to me next week? I need the money now, for gas. I don't have two thousand. Two thousand in cash, here and now! Either that, or I'm gone. You're wasting my time. See ya. Why didn't you pay the man? I didn't have the two thousand. Then, what do we do with this? Let me think. Flip it. Come on, higher, push, push... You can do it. Go! That way, follow the bus route. No, we should go this way. What? Look at Taipei 101. See how big it is now? We've got to make it this small. What? On the bus over this morning, it was this tiny. Remember? And as we got closer, it got bigger. So, to get back to our dorm, we've got to shrink it like this. Got it? - Which way now? - That way. - Let's go. - Follow the bus route. Right. This way, it'll be quick. Why are we going there, Manuel? It's a shortcut. This is illegal. Trust me. Make it quick. This is illegal. Hurry, before the cops spot us. There's a car coming. Just do it. Manuel, my slipper! What? What slipper? That one! You're stupid! Good thing you didn't get run over. I almost did. I'm still exhausted. Imagine the height of summer night with a gentle breeze... Yeah, that's great. The clear-- What the... Damn you! Fucking shit! Damn rich people! That's enough, it wasn't his fault. Those with the biggest cars have the tiniest dicks. Then, we're on the rooftop, clear sky, twinkling stars. I'm on my guitar. You're on the drums. Like old times. Holding an ice-cold Taiwan beer... Taiwan Beer? Why not the local ones back home? Where do you find those here? We're in Taiwan. If you're going to fantasize, at least go all the way. This is my fantasy, you go make your own. Let's go back to my Taiwan beer... Back to dorm, I shower, change and eat. Then I'll just stretch out on this baby and dream. Getting ahead of yourself again, Manuel? For you, everything is just a dream. What just happened? We got hit! You just kept going... The light was green. It's not our fault! Help him up... Let's move him to the side. We'll put him there... and leave. Come help me. Boss... Are you okay? Are you hurt? I can't! You live in Taiwan. Speak Taiwanese! - We apologize. - I'll accept Mandarin... Don't speak that ABC shit to me... We're sorry, we didn't mean... - This is all your fault. - Manuel, he's losing it... I'll beat this guy up! Running around with that couch, - I'll beat this guy! - Jumping innocent people. - Don't do it! - Hey! - Stop it! - How are you going to compensate me? I think he's drunk. - You looking for an ass-whupping? - Get away from me! Pay up, pay up right now! Don't worry, we've done nothing wrong. Pay up, dammit! I said pay me. Let me at him. - You, get up. - Pay up... That's enough! Pay up! Out of my way, I'll kick his sorry ass. Stop it. Manuel. What, huh? Come here! Bring it on! - We're going to get deported! - Hey, what's all this? Sir, are you okay? Listen, Ms. Policewoman. These two jerk migrant workers hit my scooter with that couch. Look at my scooter. It's broken. - Make them pay. - We didn't... Stop it! I didn't. It's him! He's drink-driving... Sir, looks like you have drank a lot No, I didn't... It was my friend's birthday, I just had a tiny sip. Not big deal. Pay for my scooter or I can't get to work. Stop it! Everybody to the station now! What a gorgeous police officer. Why don't we have beautiful cops like her in the Philippines? You want to buy her a steak dinner too? This is a good couch. I know that it is comfortable just looking at it. You know why? Because a couch... ...is a couch. Not like the old chair I have at home. It's hard and uncomfortable. So I say... That is why you've got to be what you are. Am I right? I'm sure they think we stole it. Who, the cops? Don't get paranoid now. They have our papers. They'll see we've got clean records. I don't want to go to prison. - Relax, nobody's going to prison. - Don't you start with me! What are these two doing with such a nice couch? Did they steal it? Sure, they'll ship it to the Philippines. Check, maybe someone's filed a missing couch complaint? You're probably right. I can't get deported. Sabrina's starting school soon. I'm an idiot. I always get caught up in your ridiculous schemes. Dado, stop! What's important now is how we are getting our couch back. That asshole cop has his eye on it. He can have it. No friggin' way, it's mine! Manuel Dela Cruz? It's Manuel. Diosdado Tagalog. That's me, it's Tagalog. Thank you. You can go. Thank you. Excuse me boss... You can't have my couch, halfwit. Be quiet, Manuel! He's a bit slow. Thank you. Thanks. Dado. What? What do you think Celia's singing at karaoke? How would I know? My bet is on "Touch Me Tonight". I am hungry. Manuel, I said, I am hungry! Don't blame me. Your timing sucks. I could have been eating Anna's birthday cake. And right about now, I should be eating steak. I'm sure there's a 7-Eleven around here. I love their sushi. You're Filipino, right? - Hello! - What are you doing out here? - And you're Ilongga? - Yes. Really? I'm Manuel. I used to live in Jaro. I'm Arlene. This is Jim, my husband. - Hello! - Hello! They need help? Don't know. Ask. Wait, where are you guys going? We'll give you a ride. Thank you for the offer, but we can't leave the sofa. Oh, that's not a problem. We can get it after giving you guys a ride. We need to use a truck for that. Truck? We can't pay for a truck. - What's happening? - Let's give them a ride home. Sure. We have a truck at home. You don't have to pay for it since we're from the same town. - Really? - But our truck isn't available today. Someone rented it and it won't be back until tomorrow. So we can give you a ride now and just get the sofa tomorrow. Oh, it's all right. We're almost there anyway. I don't want to be a bother to you guys. Are you sure? - Yes. - All right. We'll get going then. - Thank you. - Okay. Bye. Okay. Let's go. - Take care. - Thank you. - Take care. - Manuel, why are they leaving? Manuel, where are they going? Such a nice couple... Sure, but where are they going? - See, they have a truck... - Good, and... They said we could use it tomorrow for free. - Then that's great! - They offered us a ride back... But they said we need to leave the couch here. Of course I said no, and so they left. Are you nuts? That's the only chance we could be back in the factory! We can't leave the sofa here. That could be stolen here. This couch is a gift from God. You should've let me go with them. You can stay. I want to get back on time. Now you'll get me in trouble. Relax. We'll make it. Leave it to me. I want to go home... Dado, just trust me. Calm down, you're hungry. Your sugar level is down. Please don't be mad. I'll get your favorite burger from 7-Eleven. I'll find one. Bro, do you have fifty dollars? Just kidding, my treat. Smart man, Dado. My couch... You were trying to get rid of the couch? I was hungry, Manuel. You know I can't go long without food. Don't pull a stunt like this again. Hey, at least we have a ride now. Manuel, where are we? Where are we? Don't you dare answer me with a question. Didn't you watch where we're going? No. I fell asleep. This looks like a recycling factory. Come, help me. Where is Taipei 101? Where is Taipei one-zero-one? Ah, 101, over there. It's there. - Where? - There. That's a wall! Thank you, sir. Let's go! Don't act up now. Not with that ugly, sour face. If you didn't go against God's plan, and carried the couch, we'd be near the dorm by now. You're blaming me? I'm leaving! Don't do this, bro. Manuel, I don't want to end up like Carros. You don't even know where we are. I know the way, trust me. Besides, it's only three o'clock. Already? We've wasted too much time! Leave the sofa. Come with me. Let's go. You go, if you want to. You do know what happens when we get there late? We're almost there. Almost where? Manuel, I have a family. I can't afford to play 'fast and loose'. I play 'fast and loose'? Leave then. Manuel! Leave! I'm impressed, Dado. Shut up. Stealing from kids. Didn't know you had it in you. Well, you didn't stop me. Let's tie this up. - Dado. - Yes? Something's up. You're right. There's someone up on the roof. You watch out! I'll get up there and flay you alive! - Bastard, come down this minute. - I'm not going down! Every day with the drama... You want to jump, jump then! Fine, I'll jump for you! Don't come near me. - We aren't moving. - If you come near, I will jump What is she doing? I don't know. Push that couch away. Shoot this couch, come nearer. Up there, shoot the kid. Push that couch away. The kid's safe. Thank god. Let me ask the nurse for directions. What now? Have you tried betel nut? Dado, can I get fifty bucks? Are you nuts? No! It's just fifty, come on. I've spent so much on you today. I bought you hamburger and dried mangoes... I only have a hundred left and you're still taking it? Nice couch. Give me my change. Manuel! Once this sofa is up on our roof, I'm charging one hundred dollars for anyone who uses it. And me? Half price, you pay only fifty bucks. What now? Fine, twenty-five. Okay. You're free of charge. What's wrong? Manuel, this is our couch. I get half! No way, my foot. Dado, you're greedy! Come back here. Wait! Why? What is it? What do you want? Is she speaking English? You think this is live, Dado? I don't understand a word, but... I don't like her. Let's go. Let's do this. I'll count to three. - When I count to three, let's run. - Okay. One, two, three... Run! Hurry, Dado! Run! Are they in frame? Pan right a bit. Now. Three, two, one, go... This pair of Indonesian migrant workers saved a boy's life with their couch. We followed this pair from the scene of the attempted suicide, they have been carrying the couch from the scene of the attempted suicide, all the way to Keelung, where I am standing at now. However, we are still not able to know why they are moving around with the couch. What is actually going on? Are we witnessing a robbery? And finally, what is it about this couch that makes these migrant workers risk deportation over it? Our reporters are always on the spot to show you what's going on. I wonder what Miss Betel Nut likes? Dado. What? What should I get the Betel Nut girl? Would you hurry up? Dog! Run! There's a dog! Hurry! It's coming! Dado, leave the sofa, drop it... Let's stay here. Get that dog away from me. Why me? You know I'm scared of dogs. Go for it. It's your idea to go this way, remember? Come on, Dado. You know how to deal with dogs, right? Find a way. Get rid of the damn dog. Are you kidding? You want to do this? Okay, you do it! Dried mango for a dog, are you serious? It's a dog. Stupid. I am not stupid, you are! You're not even sure if we are allowed to take that sofa inside our dorm. You know what, Dado, if you think this is stupid you better leave then. Yeah, I want to go home, I miss my family. Then what are you doing here? You dragged me here. That's it! That's the stupid idea. You came with me. You know why you're here? Because you've got nothing going on in the Philippines! That's not true. Yeah? Then get rid of that dog! So we can cross the river before sunset. Or better yet, cut and run. Cut and run from Taiwan, like you did with Anna! Don't say that. I have a plan. Then prove it. Show me some balls. No balls... Enough! Loser. Loser... Fine! I'll deal with it! Are you happy now? See, it's shallow. It's shallow, I told you. You're right. Dado. Can a Sunday get any better than this? No, this is it. The couch, it'll get wet. Dado, it's getting wet. What, what happened? Raise it, it's getting wet. - This isn't shallow, it's deep. - I didn't expect the bottom to drop out. Lift, lift it up... Is it soaked? You' re a liar, Manuel. How could I have known? Up, more... You take too many short cuts. It's getting wet! You only think of this precious couch. Higher there. A bit more on this side... A little more... That's too deep! You told me it's just shallow. I choked on water. Sorry. Let's go. What about the couch, the rooftop, the ice-cold beer, the star-lit nights? I lied. We're not going to make it. I know. Let's go home. Relax, take a break. Anna. It's me, Dado. Happy birthday. Thank you. I'm sorry I hurt you. Anna, are you still there? You know, since I met you, life in Taiwan has been easier. Just got off the phone with Gus. He was drunk as usual. He doesn't even know where our child is. Anna... We're okay, Dado. I'm not that deep of a person. Thank you, Anna. Thank you very much. You still remember that tune? Of course. How can I forget, it was our band's first song. Remember when I put the band together? Yes. You played so hard-to-get. You were such a nag. Come on, you wanted in. Not with you all love-struck and dazed. When was I in love? The question would be, "When aren't you in love?" Okay, what was the band called? Christina! I rest my case. Who wouldn't fall for her? She was really gorgeous. So you admit it? Wonder where she is? You asked the very same question when she stood you up at our big gig. I'm so close to forgetting all about it, but.. Thanks for reminding me. You're a real friend. Do you... Do you ever give thanks to all the blessings you've received? You're so lucky. You have Anna. A family back home... Me, I got nothing. No Christina. No Celia. No family. Nobody. Just me. The sun smiles The wind kisses me The stars wink The moon caresses Everything comes to life Colors fill up everything around me When I'm with you I pray that you will always be by my side Even if we are far apart We will still be together I wish that you will always be by my side Anywhere in this world It's always you and me When I am lonely Alone and sad Your picture and memory Will be my guide I may be far from you But it won't stop me From dreaming That we are together I pray that you will always be by my side Even if we are far apart We will still be together I wish that you will always be by my side Anywhere in this world It's forever you and me Give me the bottle... This sea breeze is the best. That's true. Hey, what do you want for dinner? How about a squid adobo? Let's swing by the market. I'll cook. I could go with chicken adobo too. Or maybe pork adobo? Sure. But we've been eating too much pork. We might have a heart attack. So, what do you want? Something healthy like water spinach adobo. Water spinach adobo sounds good. That's so vegetarian! A dog! Keep him away. Do you want to turn into a dog adobo? Aside from adobo, what's nice is a trip around the world. Then, we'll lease a lot, put up a furniture factory, sell around the world. Furniture, great idea. We should export it, so we'll make lots of money... Exactly. We should get all the Filipinos to buy our products. You can sell to everyone in the world and not just Filipinos! That's right. We'll make plenty of... Dollars!
