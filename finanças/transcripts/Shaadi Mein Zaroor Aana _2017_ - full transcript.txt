Dear wait.. -What happened sister? -You come here Just now I sent a message to Sattu Is every thing fine? What happened? Listen carefully, to what I say Today morning I went to your in law's house I told your mother in law that, Aarti wanted to do a job after marriage She completely rejected it And said Daughter in law of Mishra family does not work How can she say that? Sattu himself told me Yes, I said you talked to Sattu about it Did you know what she said? Sattu is kid and she still buy his underwear. Do you know what this means? She didn't say this to me, She wanted you, to know That you definitely can't do job when you are there Forget about PCS But Sattu told me What will happen with Sattu's words? He can't speak a word in front of his mother. Now you decide, what do you want? Sister...I can't be a housewife I want to marry Sattu But in our first meeting itself I told him I wanted to work And he accepted I can't be a housewife I will talk to Sattu once... Why are you saying Sattu...Sattu like a parrot? He is going to be my husband He is a clerk When you become an officer, 25 clerks like Sattu will work under you I'm not saying that he is a bad guy. He is very good.. But even if he wants to, he can't understand this, Aarti What will I do now? What will I do....means? Look at me, father in law, mother in law, husband, children And three meals of the day, which nobody cares And on other side..respect, freedom and your self earned living. Think of it, Aarti Your future is calling you Think of it...why did your results come today? It could've come tomorrow, after your marriage You could have done nothing but now you can. Go from here, just go I'll call my husband He'll handle everything You go to Varanasi with him I can't do this to Sattu Can you do it to yourself? I and my husband are with you, you go Nobody will listen to you Go from here... Dear, you first become an officer, Dad, Sattu...everybody will give in. Aarti What do you want, dear? Dad, Sattu That I'll take care Do you want to be an officer? Then go away There is no other way, dear The society is like this, Value their boys more But don't value their girls And doesn't give them the life they want That's why whenever a girl gets the chance She must keep her head high and live life on her terms She should cross all the sea of fire and go Go dear, Go Aarti, leave now, Baraat is at the door I have to go down so that no one suspects and come I can't do this sister, Dad will kill me Aarti, Uncle said he'll take care of everything..right? Just keep in mind that Uncle will say, That you heard about dowry and ran away Sister, what wrong did Sattu do? He loves me very much You will get love again in life But this opportunity won't come again, Go.. Can I talk to him once please..? Only once.. No Aarti...Not now, and don't talk to him until I say If they come to know why you ran away They'll put all the blame on you Come now Abhaa, Baraat came Come, Let's welcome them Mom Brother in law is waiting at the back You go now.. Go, go. Good luck Congratulations To you too Where is Aarti? Where is Aarti? I'm asking you something She didn't want to marry, Dad She didn't want to, or you didn't want her to? What are you doing? Beating your married daughter? Go from here, Go away If not beat her...what should I do? Worship her? Please don't hit her...why are you hitting her ? Baraat is here Tell me where did she go? She must have told you.. I do not know Dad, sorry Dad Educate her more Send Allahabad to study You can't even look after a young girl? Why did you invite her? It's because of her... Uncle, why are you scolding sister? I didn't pass till now At least Aarti has passed If I can, I would have choked them And burn myself Don't say so... She has disgraced us.. What will we do now? Come here I can understand your pain It is a hard time, But we must somehow break it out See don't think of the world Just think about the 18 lakh cash, we gave. What will happen to it? Now you tell me what to say Sorry Mishra ji, we made a mistake Forgive me, our daughter ran away Put our money in an envelope and give it back, Like this? That's it Sir! You don't understand Once Mahesh hears our daughter ran, he won't give us a rupee back All the savings of your life will go So how will we get the money? Sister it won't, We must get it out Brother in law, I'm begging you, let me handle this from here Just keep quiet in front of them We will drink tea later First, tell us what's the matter? Why did you call us here? Mishra ji, the thing is there's a big problem For us and for you also -Problem? -Yes Jogi ji, What is the issue? The thing is that, Aarti What happened? Son, when we checked, she wasn't in her room Not there....means? There was only this letter Take it You look When our daughter came to know that, You've asked 25 lakhs as dowry She decided not to get married She left the wedding and went Where did she go? Dear, how do we know where she went? Let me to talk to her She isn't answering our calls, How do we make her talk to you Shukla ji, how's it possible Everything was fixed with the consent of both sides You are right I know it's not the matter of dowry I'm sorry, Sattu I haven't told you one thing, I attended PCS exam Today it's result came and I passed in it I'll be an officer She went to study in Allahabad Maybe she had an affair there The girl ran away, disgracing the family Did you understand? Buy lots of charcoal and put it on your faces, understood? -Put a brake on your tongue, Mahesh -Or else What will I do? I don't want to talk to you Look Mishra ji, you are educated I am folding hands and requesting you Now our daughter doesn't want to be related to your family So, return our 18 lakhs, in peace And go back with respect This wedding is canceled Is this train ticket? wedding canceled?
