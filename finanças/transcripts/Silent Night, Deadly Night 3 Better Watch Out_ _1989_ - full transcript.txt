(Monitor beeping) (man whispers) Laura. (Screams) Laura. (Pants, shrieks) (screams) Laura. (Screams) Help me. Ho, ho, ho. I want a Barbie doll and a bicycle and roller skates and ballet shoes and a Mickey Mouse watch and a doll. (Screaming) Easy, easy. Laura, Laura, it's okay. It's all right. You're just dreaming. Just dreaming. You're back now. It's all right. All right. Just lie down. That's it. That's it. Just lie down. There, that's it. Let me have a look here. - Ow. Ow, doctor. - Hmm. Now... tell me. What was it? I dreamed I could see. That's normal. And what else? Nothing, really. It was just a crazy dream. That's what you're here for, to dream. What kind of a dream? A dream about Christmas, obviously, because tonight is Christmas Eve. And what about Christmas? (laughs) Santa Claus. Laura, tell me what you saw in your dream. I told you Dr. Newberry, Santa Claus. All right, let's try this again. Maybe we're onto something. Can we try this again, Laura? Anything for you, Dr. Newberry. Good. I think, I'm not sure, but I think she made contact. (Inaudible dialogue) - (Laura groans) - Nurse: Doctor? What is it, Laura? What did you see? Can I go to the bathroom? Help her, will you? Subject may be making contact. Can't be certain if subject's reaction and mental response of coma victim are connected. I wonder if she's playing games with me. (Door opens, closes) Even if she does make contact with the coma victim, she may not be aware she's doing so. She may just be denying her powers. But I can't help feel she's holding something back. Are we almost through, Doctor? Almost. Just one more try, okay? Are you with me, Laura? Yeah, okay. Now, this time, I would like you to really relax, all right? Just empty your mind of everything. All the thoughts and all the clutter, okay? Let sleep take you away. Let the dreams come. Let the dreams come and take you away. Go. Go with the dreams, Laura. Go wherever the dreams go. There's nothing to be afraid of. Nothing. Just sleep and dream. And dream. And dream. Dream. And dream. And dream. (Inaudible dialogue) (beeping) (screams) - Laura, Laura, easy, easy. - No, no. - Laura, Laura, it's a dream. It's a dream. - No, no. - It's okay. It's all right. - Here's some water, Laura. Right here. (Monitor beeping) (machine clicking) So that's all? That's it? A scary Santa? That's it. And that's all you can tell me? Uh-huh. What time is it, Doctor? My brother is picking me up. Oh, I'm sorry, it's late. Going out of town for Christmas? Yeah, my grandmother's got a house out in the country in Piru. You're going to Peru? No, Piru. It's up in the north end of the Valley. Well, you have a good time. And we'll continue after the holiday break. Oh, and, uh, thank you for the oranges. Grannie's got a million of them. Doctor? I don't think I want to do this any more. Remember, I warned you that this would require a kind of courage. Well, you have other volunteers. I understand. Certain psychic abilities can be frightening. I'm not scared. Maybe you should be. On the other hand, maybe it was wrong for me to expect someone so young could, uh, venture into these uncharted areas. We'll talk about it after Christmas, okay? - Yes, okay. - Goodbye, Dr. Newberry. Woman on P.A.: Dr. Wallace, report to operating room one. Dr. Adam Wallace, report to operating room one. (Sighs) Do you think she made contact? I think that she's playing little girl games. Her body may be young, but her soul is old. Older than we can imagine. Do you think she'll come back? She's gone too far. She'll be back. And then she'll let me go as deep as I want. She likes it. Loves it. Knowledge, she can't resist it. She wants to penetrate his mind. See what he sees. The way that he sees it. (Machine clicking) - (chatter) - (phone ringing) My brother's coming to pick me up. Could you let me know when he's here? I'm very busy, miss. Well, if you see a red jeep outside, will you let me know? I'll do my best. - Bitch. - Excuse me? Woman on P.A.: Dr. Evans, report to gynecology. Dr. Evans, report to gynecology. Thank you. (Phone ringing) Mount Memorial. - (Siren blaring) - Woman on P.A.: Nurse Corey, please report to reception. Nurse Corey, please report to reception. (Inaudible dialogue) Excuse me. Miss? Hey! Hey, excuse me. Hey, what's wrong with you? (Screaming) Hey, Laura. Hey, sis, come on. - Nurse: Is she all right? - Yeah, she's fine. Merry Christmas. Not for you. - Hey. - Sorry, I couldn't help it. Sorry I kept you waiting. Remember that girl I was telling you about, Jerri? - Oh, the aerobics instructor? - No, the stewardess. You're gonna bring Miss Friendly Skies - to Granny's for the weekend? - How'd you know? I'm psychic, remember? - Do you mind? - I'll get over it. Thanks. Let's try to get an early start and leave around 2:00. Uh-uh. I got my shrink at 3:00. Then we leave later, pea-brain. Do you know how pea-brain gets his belt off? How? (laughs) - You're sick. - I'm not. Okay, Timmy, you be a good little boy, now, and take your medicine, and Merry Christmas. Ho, ho, ho! - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, Santa. Wanna lick my candy cane, little girl? Ho, ho, ho, ho. Woman on P.A.: Dr. Rothkowitz, please report to nutrition. Well, what have we got here? Coma victim. Hey, Ricky, want a drink? What's that? Vegetables don't drink? Great, pal. More for me. Cheers. (burps) Cheers. Ah. Hey, vegetable, who's your favorite singer, "Perry Coma"? (laughs) * Fly me to the moon * And let me play among the stars * * With Ricky. Ho, ho, ho. Ho, ho, ho. (Clangs) What the fuck? Hey, buddy. Easy, boy, you're not well. Hey, Ricky, uh, you know, about the broccoli, I was just kidding. Seriously, want a drink? No, no, no! You were hostile to the receptionist after telling Dr. Newbury you were quitting his experiment. She was a bitch. But you felt angry towards her. Yes. And Dr. Newbury, does he make you angry? I guess so. That's probably why you imagined the receptionist dead. You took revenge against her in your mind. I... I don't know. Laura, I wanna talk more about those unusual experiences you say you've been having since you were a child. Seeing things, if you will. After the plane crash, when my parents died... I told you, Doctor, I don't really see things. But you see them in your mind. What does it feel like? Can you describe it to me? It's a creepy feeling. A warm sensation in my spine and I get chills on my arms. Go on. My grandmother says all our thoughts are just pieces of one big thought. We just think about the little pieces. But sometimes we're thinking about the same little piece as someone else. Mm-hmm, yes. Scientists have been saying for years that animals communicate in this way. I believe it. My Airedale Ernest, every time I go away, he knows before I'm even packing. He starts to whine. It's like a special sense that most of us don't have or if we do, don't know how to use. You might call it extrasensory perception. You mean, I'm not crazy for an Airedale? Huh. Laura, when you say you're having visions of the past, or flashes of future events, I'm not doubting you. But I am wondering if something else is going on. Like what? Laura, I'm not criticizing you. I'm trying to put you in touch with your anger. The plane crash, losing your parents while you survived, the fact that you're blind and others aren't, there's a pool of anger inside of you. And you have to let it go. You need to reach out to people. Let people help you cross the street, even if you can do it yourself. Trust people more. Who said you have to be the World's Champion blind orphan? But, Doctor, will I stop seeing these creepy things? I hate it. I don't want to see the future or the past or anything weird. I just want to be normal. Laura, no one is normal. (Screams) Yes? Well, can I help you? (Screaming) (flesh squelching) Laura, this is Jerri. Jerri, this is Laura. Hi, nice to meet you. I never shake on the first date. Don't mind Laura. You should see her when she's really pissed. It's nice to meet you, anyway. Chris tells me you're psychic? Chris tells me you give great head. Jesus, Laura. - Oops. - I'm good with my hands, too. Let's see, you take the five onto the 126 and then you turn left. Forget the map. You take the 101 to Moore Park Road. That's the way we always go. So, Laura, tell me, how long have you been handicapped? I don't consider myself handicapped. Oh. Laura will kick your ass on water skis. That's wonderful. Change the subject, baby. (Inaudible dialogue) Ricky! Ricky, huh? New boyfriend? (Car slows down) Hey, Merry Christmas, buddy. Hop in. Wanna see why I hate Christmas? The wife makes me wear it every year. Would you wear a porquería like that? Then again, you could use a little brightening up. Christo. What happened to you, man? You get a head transplant? - (Groans) - You okay, sis? Here, have some Des Moines water. It's natural carbonation. Merry Christmas to you, too. (Music playing on TV) Your pardon me, young sir. I was at my devotions. I did not hear you. I'm sorry, sir, but surely I made enough noise to awaken the dead. Man on TV: The government of France. I've seen the uniforms of many governments in my time. What would a soldier of France be wanting here? - (Phone ringing) - Man on TV #2: Shelter, for one thing. Permit me to introduce myself. Lieutenant Andre Duvalier, - Fifth Chapter... - 126 service. Oh, hi, Kathy. I'm glad you called. I'm kind of lonesome here all by myself. I'm just watching a movie. Yeah, me, too. (Bell rings) Oh, wait, wait a second, I got a customer. Hold on, though, don't hang up. I want you to talk dirty again to me like you did last night. Okay. Okay, don't hang up. I'll be right back. Merry Christmas. Can I help you? Kathy on phone: Hey, Greg? Are you there? Come on. I wanna talk dirty to you. Greg? Okay, listen, I know you're there. I've thinking about you and my panties get wet just waiting for it. Oh, Greg. Man on TV: Stephen? - Yes, baron? - Cognac for our guest. (Humming) Oh, gosh, you're dumb. (Bell rings) (payphone dings) The phone's gonna ring. (Phone ringing) Hello? Oh, hi, Chris. Where are you? You know people ask me all the time if I'm not afraid of flying. The airline says you have just as much chance dying in a plane crash as you do being hit by lightning. And if they told you pit bulls make good house pets, would you believe that, too? Your favorite chestnut dressing. What? (chuckle) Tell Laura I made gooseberry pie. Just like when you were little. Oh, Chris, I was gonna go out, but it's such a long trip to the store. Could you stop and get a couple of sticks of butter for me? Thanks, dear. I'll see you in an hour. Drive carefully. (Music playing on TV) Kathy: I've waited for so long. (Doorbell rings) Yes? The scene here at County Hospital is one of mass confusion in the wake of two brutal murders. According to Lieutenant Connely, both the hospital receptionist and an unidentified man... Woman on P.A.: Officer Sandoval, report to security. Take me through this again, will you, Doc? You say this guy was in a coma? Comatose for six years, yes. Comatose six years? How come he's running around killing people? I believe that he's innocent until proven guilty. You do? (laughs) Come here. Come on, I want to show you something. Your, uh, coma victim, what's his name? Caldwell, Richard Caldwell. Caldwell rings a bell. Richard Caldwell. Wait a minute, Ricky Caldwell? It was about six years ago, "The Santa Claus killer"? He was really cute. Chopped people up with an axe. She sees what he sees. It's not the same guy, it couldn't be. This, uh, Ricky got iced in a shootout. Not quite. I was there. We pumped a dozen rounds into this bastard. Blew half his head off. His brain was surgically reconstructed. We brought back some of his basic motor functions so that his heart and lungs could keep working. We may have even reactivated his memory centers. But, uh, there was no way to know as long as he was in a coma. You jump-started his memory, Doc, is that it? In the vernacular, yes. Well, ain't science great? I've gotta tell you, if you don't mind my saying, I'd have pulled his plug. Even his life was of value, Lieutenant. Now, go ahead, eat. It's nice and hot. Good for you. There, there. You don't have to thank me. You see, we're experimenting with coma victims. We're trying to see if people with psychic ability can establish telepathic communications. I'm sorry, Doc, but all this new-age stuff just goes right over my head. All right, look. Imagine, um, imagine a telephone hasn't been used in a while. We're trying to see if we can make it ring. Okay, now, watch this. Laura. Hear that? Laura. What do you make of that, Doc? There's a young woman that we use in the experiment. She's extraordinary. She doesn't even have any idea of her powers. Her name is Laura. Laura, hmm? And she just sort of, uh, rang his telephone, is that it? She touched his soul. He's drawn to her. If she sees what he sees, what if Ricky sees what Laura sees? Just got a report in from the sheriff's office. There's a homicide out on Old Moore Park Road. They found hospital tags on the scene. I think it just might be our boy. Laura who, Doc? Where is she? Laura Anderson. I don't know where she is, but I tell you one thing, Lieutenant, you had better find her before he does. Those are my grandchildren, Chris and Laura. That one's Laura. Pretty, isn't she? You know, she's handicapped, too. They're coming tonight. It's an annual tradition. I'm just checking to see if Santa left a gift for you. (Grandma screaming) Jerri: * We wish you a Merry Christmas * - * We wish you a merry... - Chris: Wait, start, I'll start low, - you start high, okay? - Okay. - * We wish... - No, I start low. - (laughs) - Okay, okay, okay. (Both singing) * We wish you a Merry Christmas * * We wish you a Merry Christmas * * We wish you a Merry Christmas * * And a happy New Year * We wish you a Merry Christmas * * We wish you a Merry Christmas * * We wish you a Merry Christmas * * And a happy New Year * Good tidings to... (laughs) What's wrong? (Sighs) I guess I'm just tired. You two go on in and I'll get the bags. Granny? Granny? She's not here. - Chris: Are you sure? - She always hears the car. She always comes out on the porch to wait for us. Shit. I forgot to pick up some butter. Something's not right. Maybe she walked down to the Oats' house. Unless the boogeyman got her. Chris isn't gonna let the boogeyman get us, are you, Chris? Where's a telephone booth? I have to change. I like you just the way you are, Clark. Careful you two don't drown each other. Laura, give it a rest, will you? There's something wrong. Chris, I'm serious. Something's wrong. Laura, don't go all "Twilight Zone" on us, please. This chair's out of place. The chair's always right there by the fireplace. - How can she tell? - We grew up in this house. She knows every inch of it by heart. The chair should be here. So the chair is moved. What's the big deal? Come on, Jerri, I'll show you the rest of the house. (Wind howling) Granny? (laughs) Granny. (Footsteps) Wow, neat old house. Hey, Laura, are you okay? Why don't you start that bath? I'll check out the food situation. (Humming) Happy hour. (Dog barking) Hey, don't be sad. I can't help it this time of year. It makes me think about mom and dad. Hey, to Christmases past, present, and future. (Humming) (dog barks) (dog barks) I don't know about this. Just come on in. - Too hot? - You or the water? Mm. So nice. I don't think your sister likes me very much. I don't know. It takes her a while to warm up to people. But I don't want to talk about Laura. Okay. - Hey, what are you doing? - (giggles) Scrub my back. You mean, like that? Mm. Like this. I thought you wanted me to scrub your back. Shut up. This is just an old cop grabbing at straws, here, but, uh, if this guy is really on her wavelength, uh, it's possible that wherever she's gone, he's headed that way, too? She said that she was going to her grandmother's for the holidays. Uh-huh. I don't suppose you know where grandma lives? She mentioned something about, uh, Piru. Oh, that's north. Or it could be west, about 50/50. You can take your choice. You're not blowing smoke up my ass, are you, doc? That sounds like an enterprise of great pith and moment which I would just as soon decline, lieutenant. Just asking. She always brings me oranges. She said something about her grandmother having a lot of orange trees. Well, that's something, anyway. Yeah, Connely, here. I want you to go through the names of all the orange growers in Ventura. Look for Anderson, registered as Anderson. Yeah, right. Wait! Wait! Maybe we should go look for Granny at the Oats'. - Come on, babe, let's go for a walk. - Let's go. There's the North Star. There's the Big Dipper. And right over there, that's Orion. Where's Orion? I don't see it. Come on, now, baby, don't try to scare me. I don't like it, okay? (Shouts) Who lives here? Workers, people who pick the oranges. They come and go. Maybe Granny's here. We can give it a try. (Knocks) (dog barking within) How about that house? Man on TV: Gustav. She is saying you. She loves you. You must... help her tonight. Her soul cries out for release. Go back. Nobody at the Olsen's house, either. Yeah, I forgot. Terry always goes down to Baja this time of year. He has a trailer near La Fonda. You're worried, aren't you? I can tell. Well, it's weird. It's Christmas eve and Granny's not here. My kid sister is alone at the house. She's hardly a kid. Anyway, what about me? Hey, everybody's a kid on Christmas. You won't need those soon. Uh, you mean, um... We're practically there already. Ah-ha. You, uh, you hooked up? Uh, I mean, with one of these? Oh, no. I make it a rule never to attempt two important functions simultaneously. That's what I said. But once you get one, you'll never know how you did without it. You know, you got call registry, and call waiting, call forwarding, hundred-memory auto dialer. You got a stick? A what? Well, if you drive a stick shift, you need the hands-free option. That... that's a must. It sounds like you have a, uh, financial stake in these... hazardous toys. Well, I do get a hundred bucks off my cellular bill for every new signup. Well, perhaps you should, uh, conserve your zeal and vigor for the pursuit of our lost friend. Doc, you seem to know your way around all this mystical stuff. But do you know what they call it when you get déjà vu twice? A re-occurring extra-sensory phenomenon. No. Stupid. (laughs) Chris: You should give her a chance, Laura. Give me a chance. Be more tolerant of people, okay? I know it's hard, but nobody's perfect. You don't have to be perfect, either. I love you so much. Sorry, Chris. It's okay. I've been so jumpy lately. I don't know why. That experiment? Maybe. I just feel like that something's pressing at me, and I keep pushing it away. Does that sound crazy? What does your shrink say? He says it's a disequal... Diseq... Disequilibrating phase of my development. What does that mean? Heck if I know. I'm just plain nuts. Yeah, well, if you weren't a little nuts, you wouldn't be my sister. We're two peas in a pod. Two peas in a pod. And Granny. Where is Granny? The Oats' house was locked up, nobody home. We should go into town and look for her. Just give her another fifteen minutes. Granny won't mind if we warm up dinner. I'm starved. Did you move your car? No, why? It's not there any more. You know, with all your talk about scientific theory, there's one thing you keep leaving out of the mix. A little item called murder. Granny! Granny? Granny. (Screams) Hey, what's going on? Oh, Chris, please. Something really weird is happening. We just found my car. - Upside-down in the orange grove. - Completely trashed. Let's go. We can walk to the highway, please. - What if Granny needs our help? - Why don't we call the cops? - Smart. - I'll call. It's dead. Let me give it a try. You see, Vitus, even the phone is dead. It's not funny, Chris. Look, if somebody robbed the place, don't you think we would have noticed by now? Look. My picture... it's gone. Carved him up pretty good, huh? Red reactivates his childhood trauma. (Phone ringing) Wait a minute, that's my car. Yeah? Hello? Damn it. Yeah, Connely. Yeah? What you got? I'm in Piru. (Sighs) Can you hear me Ricky? Did you find her yet? Your soul still searching? I should have left you alone. I'm sorry. I should have let you sleep. Okay, about fifteen minutes up the road is a farm registered with the Orange Growers Association under the name of Anderson. Let's hope it's the same one. Let's hope we're not too late. It's him. I know it is. Chris: Who, Laura? He was a little boy, and then, and then something happened, something terrible. What happened? What little boy? I saw into his mind. He was showing me his past. Who? What are you talking about? I don't know what's going on here, but whatever it is... (screams) Holy shit! It's no use. (Jerri crying) He won't be stopped. (Shouts) Are you okay? He almost killed her. It's not her he's after. Do you know this guy, Laura? If we stay here, he'll kill us all. So what are you gonna do when we find him? Well, uh, we always hope that the guy will surrender... himself. But in a case like this it's really very difficult to tell. I'd just kind of like to stop him before he kills somebody else, you know what I mean? Then there's a possibility that you'll kill him? Well, there's always that possibility. There's no way that you can trap him, take him alive? I suppose you'd get all bent if somebody was to suggest you care more about your scientific theory than you do about innocent people? There are no innocent people, lieutenant. We're all guilty. Guilty of being stupid, irrational, doomed, and badly-designed. No, science is the only way to restore our innocence. Ricky isn't a killer, he's a way to stop people from killing, like snake venom is a way to cure the bite. Well, studying snakes is your thing, doc. Stomping on them is mine. And speaking of snakes, excuse me while I relieve the reptile. Crazy son of a bitch. Come on, Chris, let's go. Didn't he say he was just going upstairs? Look, Laura, we're all in this together, okay? Chris, hurry! Chris? Look what I found. It's granddad's old greener, with 12-gauge shells. This thing must be 100 years old. Hope these are still good. What's the matter? Come on, Laura. Wait. What is it? I don't know. (Screams) Laura: Jerri, Jerri. Chris, no! Help. Help, Chris! Run, go back to the house. No, Chris! - (Screams) - Oh! Let's go back! No! (Coughs) Hello, Ricky. It's Dr. Newberry. (Screaming on recording) Doctor: Easy, easy, easy Laura. Laura, it's okay. It's all right. You're just dreaming. You're just dreaming. Now tell me, what was it? She woke you up, didn't she? Laura: I dreamed I could see. Doctor: That's normal. And what else? Laura: Well, nothing, really. It was just a crazy dream. Doctor: Well, that's what you're here for, Laura, to dream. What kind of a dream? Laura: A dream about Christmas, obviously because tonight is Christmas Eve. Doctor: And what about Christmas? Laura: Santa Claus. (Stops tape) (grunts) Ricky. Ricky. Laura. He's dead, isn't he? Isn't he? Yes. Two peas in a pod. He was all I had. I'm sorry. I loved him, too. But we can't just wait here for this maniac to come get us. (Crashes) (screams) There's another gun, my grandfather's army pistol. It's under one of the beds, maybe this one. It must be the other. Stay here, I'll get it. No. Jerri... Shh, I'll be right back, I promise. Jerri? Yeah. I'm sorry I was mean to you. (Screams) Jerri? I can feel you here. Jerri? (Gasps) Laura. (Screams) (loud breathing) (screams) Granny: Laura? No. Laura, listen to me, dear. No. Are you listening? You must listen to me, Laura. You have the power. It is a gift. You must accept it. Learn how to use it. I'm scared, Granny. Don't be frightened, child. Use your power. Use it to do good for people. Use it for your life and the lives of others. But I don't know what to do, Granny. Please, help me. Concentrate, Laura. Use your mind like a lens to gather the light, to shine in the darkness where you cannot see. Use your power, child. No one can hurt you if you use the power. Granny? Granny, you're here. I can feel you near me. Granny? Granny? Granny, please don't leave me. Please don't leave me. Help me. Help. (Screams) (grunts) Now we're even. (Shrieks) Chris: Hey, bubblehead. (Cocks shotgun) Is it live, or is it Memorex? (Yelps) (gunshot) Chris! (Coughs) I'm over here, Ricky. Come and play. (Gasping) (siren blaring) Give me a call sometime, doc. Lieutenant, don't be stupid. I love you, Chris. (Police radio chatter) Call ahead to intensive care to set up life support. With a little luck, we can save this guy. (Siren blaring) Um, how are you doing? Are you okay? I'll be fine. Thanks. I don't know how you did it. But I guess there's a lot of things that I don't know. Merry Christmas. And a happy New Year.
