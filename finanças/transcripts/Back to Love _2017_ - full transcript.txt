[instrumental music] [sighs] [instrumental music] [indistinct chatter on TV] Hello? Air Bear! [Jill] Erica, is that you? - Hi, daddy. - Sweetie. - Oh. - Hi. Marc. Nice to finally meet you. Come here. - Hi, mom. - Mm. Oh. - This is Marc. - Such a pleasure, Mrs. Moore. Oh, so nice to meet you. Sorry we missed you on our last visit. - How was your drive? - Uh, easy. Something smells good in here. Oh, Erica's favorite brownies. Three more minutes left. I'm so glad you're home. Your room is almost ready, let me just put the duvet cover on. Just came out of the dryer. Dale, can you grab those bags and bring them into Erica's-- M-mom, we couldn't-- Erica, your sister's going to be here at six with the bridesmaid dress. And, Marc, make yourself at home. - Thank you. - Sounds perfect. Oh. Uh, it's, uh, Seth after his first tour. - He looks handsome there. - He is. He was. That's April and me. She's much taller now. [laughs] And you know April never was great at handling stress. I think you mean she never stresses. Well, if Scott and I weren't here to actually make a plan for this thing, it'd be falling apart. Well, I'm here now, so just tell me where the ship's headed and I can help steer too. Homefront is putting on an event. - Uh, it's Nate's charity, right? - That's right, on Sunday. There's been some competition for table rentals if you wanna help find a solution. Tables. On it. The event does sound lovely though. Honoring all the vets involved with the organization. We should all go support. Yeah. Okay. [chuckles] Um, we're buying a condo. Near Lincoln Park. It's gorgeous. I'm so excited to get back and start setting it up. That's a big step. - Is it time for that? - I think so. I've been reading articles about how soon is too soon. - Why, you think it's too quick? - Not at all. I'm happy for you. - Hello? - In here. - Hi! - You're here! - Oh. - Where's Marc? April, don't tell me the dress is in this bag. It's fine, mom. [sighs] Well, I can steam it. Okay. - Save me. - I'm here. [Jill] April, don't forget about the florist appointment tomorrow. Yeah, I got it. [Jill] And then the meeting with the caterers at three. Let's start packing the welcome bags tonight. - Wow. - I can't. We're, uh, going out with everyone. [Jill moans] Oh, my God. Mm, well. ♪ So I'm gettin' married ♪ ♪ And we're gonna eat some cake ♪ ♪ And I get to watch Scott get old and saggy yeah ♪ ♪ It's gonna be great ♪♪ It's beautiful. It's beautiful. [laughs] [blues music] I wasn't a fan of the barn venue. It's supposed to be the most meaningful day of our lives... not a stockyard show. Plus, it took a lot of explaining to my grandmother that getting married outside of a church actually still counts. Yeah, Scott is very concerned about getting hay on his tux. - Oh. - That's not the only reason. - Mm. - We've talked about it a lot. - It's one of 'em. - Yeah. No, it, there's many reasons. There are currently about 5000 but you guys probably wouldn't know that because you're not in my head. - It's gonna be fine. - It sticks, I mean, I... Yeah, it's dusty. It's a dusty environment. [April] You wanna look nice. He wants to look nice. [Erica] I, sure. [Scott] I do wanna look nice. As best I can... - Hey. - Hey. You're 20 minutes late. You're early though. - Ah, one week! - Hey. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I don't know what I was thinking. - Good to see you. - Yeah, you too. Welcome home. I can't even remember the last time I paid $3 for a drink. [chuckles] Hi, I'm Marc. Uh, my boyfriend. Oh, Nate. Scott's best man and one of my oldest friends. Of course, yeah. Let's get you drinkin'. I need some embarrassing stories. Well, now that we're all here I wanted to do a little toast. Um, April, would you like to say something? Oh, um... sure. [chuckles] Yes. I mean, I don't have anything prepared. Um, but, okay. Uh, thank you all for being here, seriously. Uh, this terrible beer and terrible company... [imitates kazoo] Makes the moments worth having. And, I can't imagine such a big moment in my life without any of you. Except maybe Marc. I mean, let's be honest, we just met, so... [laughs] Uh, I'm excited. [chuckles] Okay, uh, mic drop. - That's... Back to you. - Yeah. - Cheers. - Cheers. So, I had a couple of speeches saved for the big day but I wanted to do this one now 'cause I didn't wanna make it a thing. Don't worry, it's short. [groans] "April and I are so grateful to have everyone here "we love with us this weekend. "Family, friends. "Best man was probably the easiest choice "in the process so far. "Besides choosing my bride, of course. "But in the last few years, Nate has become my brother. "To my new big sister. "We're so glad to have you back home. And thank you for convincing your sister to go out with me." You're goin' in my will for that one. - Oh. - Mm. - Don't expect much. - Ah. "And to Seth. "We all wish you were here. "Not just to be our designated driver and pay for pizza, but... "Well, none of this is the same without you. "And lastly, to my beautiful bride. "You made me happier than a bird with a French fry "when you decided to marry me. Thank you for changing my life." Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. [indistinct chatter] I'm gonna get a drink. You guys want anything? - Uh, no, we're good. - Okay. - Here you go. - Thank you. Whiskey neat? It's a single malt scotch, upgraded. - You seem-- - Marc seems nice. Yes. He is. I'm really lucky. - How'd you meet? - Uh, work. Fundraiser. - You still do... - HR? - Yeah. - I do. Well, I'm sure they love you. [chuckles] How have you been? You know, I've been really good actually. - I've been busy with Homefront. - Hm. Yeah, my, my mom said there is an event on Sunday. Yeah, it's just a little get-together. We're trying to raise awareness for the organization but also honor the people it's for, you know. - All vets, right? - Yeah. Yeah, we help them find employments. Um, construction work, technology, things like that. Get them readjusted to civ life. That's really incredible, Nate. Um, yeah, there's gonna be food and a, and a raffle. - It should be fun. - Proud of you. Thanks. Uh, it seems to be workin' out so far. We are having a-a small dedication of a few new park benches for the fallen vets. Including Seth's. Well, nobody told me Seth was being honored. They didn't? Oh, I, I figured... Well, I don't have your number anymore or I would've called. You don't? No. But, um... if you wanna see the benches you could come by Homefront and see while you are here. - No, I-- - If you want. Do you still have the same number? - Mm, 555-- - 3728. - Well-- - Would you-- - I should-- - No. Uh, uh, nothing. Go ahead. I was saying I, I should probably get back. I don't want to leave him with the sharks too long. Yeah. It was really good to see you. You too. Mm. - How's work? - Mornin'! Got an early start. Bumped up my conference call. Stickin' to a hard out at four. - Good. - What's your plan for today? Uh, just wedding stuff, I think. Gonna meet everyone down at the barn at 4:30 if you can make it. Um, definitely tryin'. I was thinkin' about going down to see the bench they made for Seth this morning. Do you want me to go to that too? No, no, you finish this. Makes most sense. I'm trying to get everything done before the wedding day, you know. Yeah. Yeah, we knew that was the deal. I'm just glad you're here. I understand, sir, but the donation is so small. Okay, well, I appreciate your time and maybe next quarter. Okay. Yeah, maybe next quarter, you can take one less cruise so you can show the tiniest bit of appreciation for those who gave their lives so you can have that vacation. - Hi. - Hi. I'm, uh, Nate's friend, Erica. Oh, Seth's widow. Yeah, um, that's right. Me too. A widow. - Seven years. - Oh. I'm Melanie. It's nice to meet you. I'm so sorry. Likewise. Nate. Uh, of course, Tom, thank you so much. We really appreciate it. Bye-bye. Oh, you showed. I showed. So next, I'll be demonstrating how to bend wood. Now we're gonna take multiple layers and we're gonna bend them around the form and, Donald, the camera is drooping. - Don. - Hey, grandma. Uh, ah, kitchen's closed. - But the bar is still open. - Ah. - Hi, Grace. - Oh. - Hey, Roger. - Hi. - Roger. - Hello, sweetheart. Wow. I think this is beautiful. This is artistry. Yeah, well, we know what we're doin'. [chuckles] This one's Seth's. We're gonna put his favorite quote right here. Well, we're guessing it's his favorite quote 'cause it's the one he used in his valedictorian speech. We'll say that it is. So did you bring 'em? We had these made. I'm gonna put each one of their tags... right here. They're goin' in Tomkins Park. Oh, you have a little, uh... Just, yeah. Uh, I thought I was keeping it together so well. No one keeps it together all the time. Seth could. You're right, he could. The library. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Kid rips one and... [snickers] Seth, what are you doing? [both] I'm laughing in my quiet voice. [chuckles] Ah, what 13-year-old boy talks like that? Seth. I'm sorry for losing touch. I wrote. A couple times actually. Oh, and everything I wrote always sounded so... [sighs] I don't know. I never sent 'em. Hey. It's water under the bridge. [Scott] We're not sitting in a circle, April. - It's symbolic. - Of what? Being in a cult? Of union. And everyone can see everyone else. It becomes a shared experience. My mom's not gonna look at the back of my head the entire ceremony. Okay, fine, pretend that I am your mom. - Just-- - No, never, no. Oh, I see you, Scott. Hi. Look there you are right in plain view. You're being difficult. - Erica? - Hm? The... Oh, I can see either side. Uh, hey, Erica, would you mind grabbing me another 150 grit sanding sheet? - It's in my bag. - In your bag. Yep. You know, for somebody who says they don't really care about this sort of thing, it certainly seems like you care quite a bit. Well, I would just like for the few simple ideas that I have to be heard. - I understand that. - Do you? Is not, I mean, think about, uh, how are you gonna walk in? The other week at tastings I watched Scott debate steak or duck for an hour. Somebody's gonna be seeing my butt the entire time, so-- Well, they're seeing your butt anyway. [April] Okay, you know what, let's not do a circle. It's not like I care about the stupid chairs. He just won't listen. It's like he becomes this different person who suddenly cares about stamping family crests on place cards. Like, what? [sighs] I am so ready for all of this to be over. It's normal to be stressed. It's your big day. Thanks, Marc. I mean, I just, I wanted to go to city hall. Or like your wedding in the backyard that was perfect. I'm sorry, is that, is that a weird thing for me-- Not at all. Nope. I know Seth was important. I know that and I wish I met him. Well, that would have been one very crowded bed. [laughs] Yeah. I guess everything happens for a reason. - Uh, we need three more. - No. Yes. [sighs] [Marc] No. Today? That-that can't happen. I can't do it. Well, then get somebody else. What are you... No. He's supposed to be covering me right now. That's the deal. I worked it out with Michael. This guy gave me his word. He's supposed to cover me. That is the protocol, you know that. Yeah, we cleared it. Yes, we did. Uh, that's unbelievable. Hold on. I didn't wanna wake you. They want me back in Chicago. Apparently, the city was notified of some illegal basement on the complex that was about to close and now I'm trying to... Hold on, Jacky, I-- But I won't get to give you the tour. I wanted to show-- I know, I am trying to juggle it all but I don't wanna lose out on this deal. It could really affect how we move forward on the condo. It's just a couple of days. I'll catch a flight first thing Saturday morning. - You'll be back for the wedding? - Yes. Then go. It's important. I love you. Yeah, yeah... [scoffs] - See you soon. - Drive safely. [sighs] Mom? Dad! [sighs] [sighs] [cell phone vibrates] [whispers] I'm so sorry for your loss. [indistinct chatter] I bought you some coffee. - Oh, it's okay. - Thank you. - Hi. - It's so good to see you. - Good to see you too. Oh. - I'm so glad you're here. [Nate] So looks like we'll have a couple extra volunteers tomorrow. - Oh, that's good. - Yeah. [Nate] I think they can stay on for about a week. - I like that. - It helps. - You've been workin'. - Well, I try. I sat outside Seth's and my house for a while today. No idea what I was planning to accomplish by doing that. Just kinda ended up there. You think... Uh, whatever you wanna call it. Do you think it ever fully goes away? No. It just becomes normal. And then you feel guilty, that is normal. It changes... but it definitely doesn't go away. I do that, too, sometimes. Sit in front of the house. It just sucks. I'm really sorry. Both of you. But... I'm here. That's all. Just don't be expectin' me to be all sugary about it. [chuckles] [Marc] The good news is, Michael put a rush on it so, I'm definitely in the clear after tomorrow. I told him I'd buy every round of golf for a year. Like, he can't afford it. I know, he'll hold me to it too. Oh, hang on. - Got this for your sister. - Oh, wow. Figured they don't have too many $300 bottles in August Creek. [laughs] That's really sweet. Everything else good? Yeah, I-I helped Nate on a Homefront thing today. Um, I wish I'd been doing more since Seth. You should definitely get involved with something like that out here. Uh, let's research. I bet there's tons of VA programs out in Chicago. Yeah, yeah, totally. Yeah. And then, uh, we went to a funeral reception. Uh, for a vet. Uh, I didn't know him. But, um, it was cool to see the community around him. A vet? Yeah. Yeah, killed in a, a training exercise. Oh, that's awful. I mean, he's in a better place now. Yeah. I'm sorry I'm not there. - I miss you. - I miss you too. You better. [chuckles] - I'll see you soon, babe. - Goodnight. [man on TV] Down in the lowlands in the swamps beside the river lives a 12... - Hey, dad. - Hang on one sec. Okay. [indistinct chatter on TV] Okay, go ahead. Okay, I just wanted to say hey. I heard you're awake. Hey, bub, you want some? Sure. These guys haven't been back to the coast in three whole years. Mm. They got confused by a a weather pattern change caused by an icecap melting off the coast of Greenland. - Oh, wow. - Mm. Hm. I miss this. Our midnight snack time. I wish I had more time. Yeah, it's all planned out, isn't it? Usually is. But sometimes it comes down to the simple things, bub. We sure miss ya. - Chicago is good to ya? - Yeah. Yeah, it's an exciting place. Well, good. If you're happy, that's what matters. Oh, look at that. That's a... Eurasian wigeon, isn't it? Oh, looks like it. [chuckles] Holy smokes! Look at it go. Look, look, look. - Oh, oh, oh. - Look where he swam. - Oh, wow. - Ooh. - Where do these go? - Over there. Hey. Oh, you got 'em both. Whoa, you think this is your own private supply or what? Oh, hush. Oh, hush yourself. - Here you are. - Thank you. Yeah. - Here you are. - Thank you. You're welcome. - I made that. - What? - You don't make beer. - I do now. Very proud of that one too. It's the best one I made. Okay. [coughs] Wow. Huh. Well, I-I-I made those perfect circles over there. So who's impressed now? I mean, I'm not gonna say just anyone could have done that but they do teach circles in kindergarten. Mm. Well, kindergarteners aren't trusted with spray paint. Hm, nor should you be. Hey, but look, I am very proud of you. Oh, well, I could be a street artist. I could be Banksy. You don't know. I'm just sayin'. Hi. ♪ Rockin' ♪♪ Ah, alright. "Scott and April's first date." Going to dinner at-- Answer must be in the form of a question, mom. It's "Jeopardy" rules. What is Scott choking on a piece of popcorn in a movie theater? No. What is, uh, seeing the second "Bourne Identity" at Highland Theater? Eh, wrong. [laughs] Ah! - Yep. - I got it. I know we have a photographer already but he'll do it for free. Thank you, but we've already put the deposit down. Excuse me. Scott. That was really embarrassing, April. In the future, can we avoid such conversations in front of my parents? It's not that big of a deal. They'll just cancel the other photographer. The photographer is a professional. Okay, but my cousin is really good. And yeah, I know we'll lose a $200 deposit but we will save so much more than that. These pictures are gonna be on our mantle for the rest of our lives. We can't just, like-- Hey. You want a drink? - No. - No. Seriously, did you see the shot? - It's good. - I saw it. I had to do community service for a month. No, you didn't. Oh, Nate is reminding us of his criminal past. Ah, that time they were caught stealing candy. Oh, we didn't get caught. Seth left an apology note with the 75 cents and turned himself into the sheriff. He named me as his accomplice. [music playing over a stereo] You still omit me from that story? I can never rat you out. It's a serious crime, accessory to candy theft. [chuckles] Ketchup first. Then the lettuce 'cause you can't stand a soggy bun. Top off with four chips. You narrating my plate? Roger, you're cheating again. I see that. It's alright, it's gonna be fine. [screaming] [laughing] - I apologize. - Like, right before my eyes. [Roger] Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize. Okay. - I'm out. - Alright, goodnight, Mel. Goodnight. Goodnight. Thank you. So who do you hang out with in Chicago? Uhh, mostly Marc's friends from college. He knows a lot of people over there. They're all nice. Their girlfriends do Sunday brunches, so... I go to a lot of those. That's fun? It's expensive is what it is, but, um... [sighs] I don't know, it's good for me to go. Yeah, it's good to put yourself out there. Yeah. No 99 cent burger deal as well? No, no. It's definitely, uh, no John's Famous. I do miss this sometimes though. Did you leave because of me? No. [sighs] No. I, uh... I had to go get my life in order... somewhere else. I didn't know how to be here. Do the widow thing, the... People's expectations, the house. I didn't know how to do it either. You just... do, you know. But it was hard losing both of you. We could've stumbled through it together. Well, I did think about you. A lot, actually. I looked you up on Facebook. Stalker. Yeah, it's, it's not really my thing. Yeah, well, there's actually a, a Nate Jackson who looks eerily similar, who lives in Phoenix. So, you know, in case you were wondering. I was, thank you. Are you happy? I feel like things are finally back on track. And, that makes you... I-I mean, that's, that's what you need to be happy? Yeah. Then I'm glad things feel on track now. Ah, I think there's an outlet over here somewhere. [Nate] Oh, okay. Check the bulb. I hope something didn't chew through the wire. Um... Hey, can you shine your phone over here? Nate? Okay. It's not funny. Okay, you know I hate being scared. So... just get it over with. [car honks] God. [screaming] Stop it! [laughs] [Erica moans] I gotta go. Erica. - Erica. - No. No, this is not okay. We don't just do this. Erica, can we just talk about this? No! I'm going! I have to go. Where? I drove. Please, just take me home. [Jill] Well, we'll have to come visit soon. Hi! Hi. - Ah! - Oh. Uh, what are you, what are you doing here? Well, I tried callin' you. Oh, sorry, I-I haven't checked my phone all day. Well, Andrea finished for me so, I caught an early flight back. Oh, well, that's, like, what? That's amazing. - Are you okay? - Of course, yes. I'm just glad you're here. - Anyway... - Yes. I don't know if your parents do a big Thanksgiving or not but we would love to have everybody here. - Absolutely. - Well, that sounds like a blast. Right? Yeah. [sighs] What's wrong? Something's off. Did I do something wrong? No. No. It's just... umm, Seth stuff has come up you know, from being back. Oh. I'm sorry, I wasn't here when you needed me. I'll make it up to you. I promise. You don't have to do that. Hey, here's somethin' that'll cheer you up? Taylor and Meg got that place they were hoping to snag. So we now have a place to stay anytime we want in Grand Beach. - Mm. - Mm. [cell phone vibrates] - Hey. - Hey. You decided today wasn't a good day for you to come into work? The pamphlets came. Where are you? Okay. Hey, where are you? [sighs] Mm. Mornin'. You still feelin' emotional? Can I take you to see my favorite places now? [Nate] I mean... I have no choice but to be there. The best man typically attends, yeah. The day she left, I slept right there. She kissed you. Doesn't matter. I kissed her back. [sighs] I can't believe I did this. So... I lose my friend again. Friend? Yeah. Okay. I'm gonna count the number of girls I've seen you go out with. Let's see, there was, uh... Oh. Oh, actually... nobody. I've been busy with Homefront. I'm sure it's the same reason you never date. No, no, not the reason. A, shockingly, August Creek isn't exactly swarming with my type. And B... Jessie was it. No one else ever even... even registered after. And that was from the first moment we met and we were just friends too. It took us three years to become anything more, but... Jessie was my person. You can love a lot of people, but... love like that... doesn't come twice. She kissed you, dummy. If she's your person don't let her end up with some other person this time. Mel, I realize you never knew Seth... but he wasn't just some other person. And I'm sure Marc isn't either. Hmm. Mm. This magic... is what got me into college. My mom would get me these every time I got straight As as a kid. They're better than I thought they'd be. [clears throat] Try mine? Mm. - Mm. - Ah. [cell phone vibrates] You think you could ever picture yourself living someplace like this? Hmm, not really. [clears throat] I mean, Chicago's always done it for me. Everybody's back home. Opportunities are there and... Yeah, I don't think so. I mean, it's fun to visit though. Could you? No. I did that already but a part of me feels like I miss a lot. People take care of each other here and my family is here, obviously. Then why'd you move to Chicago? Fresh start. I'm glad I did it. Honestly, too, I feel like... I just put a lot of pressure on myself to get past it after I lost Seth. And having to get a new apartment new job, setting up new utilities it was a good distraction. Mm. Plus, I didn't have the... added expectations of being a good widow because nobody knew me in Chicago. When I was 17 our soccer team made it to the state championship... and, uh, we ended in this shootout. I was the last one to kick, so I had to win it for everybody. And I missed. I mean, like, not even close. I couldn't sleep for weeks, you know. Felt like I let everybody down. I-It's not the same, but... I get what you mean about... pressure, expectations, I guess. Wow. Hey! - Hey. - This is amazing. - I think you guys found your-- - This feels all wrong. The table's a little too close. Scott, the flow is fine. No. There needs to be more space to-- And nobody cares. Except you. We'll move 'em. Just show us where. Okay. Fine. Whatever. Do whatever you want. Oh, whoa! Hey, Nate, who invented the roundtable? Sir Cumference. [laughs] Ah, yeah, that's good. [Scott] Yeah, now that's perfect. Good. [April] Hey, Erica, can you and Nate carry the arbor in? - Please. - Sure. Thank you. Listen, I'm sorry for yesterday. Yeah, me too. I don't, It wasn't just you. I don't want you to feel bad. Yeah, well, I do. Me too. This is why you left before. Yeah, that was part of it. Do you ever think about the day Seth died? The actual moment? I do. And it doesn't matter. that I was lonely, it doesn't matter that we had grown apart, when I think that maybe... And at that moment... that I could have been kissing you... You know, I've wondered the same. Yeah, well, he deserved a lot better. So does Marc. I hate this. Tell me it will all be over soon. Tomorrow. And then it'll all go back to the way it was with Scott? - Yes. - Okay. But what if it doesn't? I mean, we haven't done it for three weeks. You and Marc were all over each other today and we're the ones getting married. I mean, is that a bad sign? Marc and I are right. You and Scott are right. You're just nervous. And, whether you like it or not... you look beautiful. - Mm. - Ah. I get to marry my best friend tomorrow. I'll meet you outside. - Hmm. - Not too shabby. Picture perfect. [instrumental music on phone] Can we try from second 12? Okay, everybody, let's, uh, let's, uh, head back. You have to answer one thing for me. [music playing on phone] Why did you kiss me? Because I can tell you why I kissed you back. This is not working. Can-can we try second 21? [music playing on phone] I know you're with Marc and that he's so... That's not what I'm trying to say. I don't want to talk about this here. [music playing on phone] This... - This can't be wrong. - Stop. I'm not talking about timing. I'm talking about-- Nate, I am with Marc whom I love at my sister's wedding. I'm asking you to please stop talking about this. - This is still not working. - It's crazy. What is the issue? It's just not working. I can't... So what if we just dance? We're not gonna dance down the aisle, April. Okay, but can we at least walk to an ironic song? I mean, this one doesn't seem to be working anyway. And I just, I think it'll be so funny if we were still super serious but it was like, "Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" or "Another One Bites The Dust." Why don't you care about this? [Jill] April, I think it's too late to make changes. Let's just run it again. Yeah, let's just stick with the plan. Yes, because God forbid, we have any fun. This is embarrassing. Can we just stick-- I don't care! I can see that. Okay, no, you're, you're right. You know what? I, I should be ashamed. You see, I, I forgot that this wedding is for them and it's for you because I know that it's not for me. Calm down. - Calm down? Really? - Mm-hmm. Since when do you talk to me like that? - I thought we were a team. - We are. Okay. Well, then how come you've made every single decision without me lately? I mean, is this what it's gonna be like our whole lives? Don't twist this. This isn't about our whole lives. Yeah, it is, Scott. And if you can't see that, then... we have way bigger problems than I realized. I can't do this. I mean, I just, I didn't realize that I was walking into some mid-century marriage where husband makes all the decisions controls our lifestyle. And me, little wife just has to look pretty for his parents. Oh, that's not Scott. He just... has some set ideas about how the day should go. But I, I wouldn't have said yes to any of that stuff. I mean, not that he even asked me. Yeah, do you know that he never actually asked me to marry him? Yeah. He took me to this awful expensive restaurant with, like, six forks. And dessert came and he starts rambling nervously about about being the chocolate to my cake. And then, some stranger walks up to me and hands me a rose with a ring on it. Like, he never actually said will you marry me? I mean, he could have asked me sitting on the couch in his boxers with a mouth full of cereal and I would have said yes. I mean, at least then it would have been about us. [sighs] I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do either. I'm sorry, I made you come home for nothing. Oh, no. I'm glad I'm here. You're gonna be okay. Yes, I promise. Oh. - Take it easy, man. - Yeah, see you. Hey, uh... Thanks for being there... for her while I was away. I know it's been tough on her being back and... and me being gone. [clears throat] I think helpin' out at project Homefront was good for her. Don't mention it. April? What's the plan here, April? I'm not getting married tomorrow. So you're gonna throw everything away because Scott doesn't wanna dance down the aisle? That's incredibly juvenile. April, come back here! Mom, just give her some space. We spent so much time on this. People have flown in. So much planning has gone into this. It can't be about that right now. I just think she's making a big mistake. Well, that's for her to decide. [sobbing] Oh, it's gonna be okay. It's just a mistake. When Seth died, I looked to anyone to tell me the right thing to do next. [sniffles] Just cling to something stable. It helps. He makes me tea every day. You want me to make you some tea? It's not the same. It's Friday. We always watch "Dr. Who" on Friday. He calls it "Dr. Who's" days. Oh. [sobbing] Erica. You excited to go home? Yeah. Goodnight. Goodnight. [Scott] April. April. April. April. Oh, my goodness. Scott! What are you doing? - I'm coming over. - Get down. Whoa! [grunts] Scott? [Scott groans] [sighs] [Scott groans] You should get a tetanus shot after this, dimwit. Let me just check to see if he has a concussion. - Hey. - I don't have a concussion. What were you guys even doing? Can you ask April to come out here? You really want her to see you like this? He showed up to my place hammered. Said he wanted to do something romantic to win April back. I told him tonight probably wasn't the night. When I went to go set up the couch for him, he bolted. What can I say to her? [Nate] Let me see it. - Oh. - No, you don't need stitches. - A bandage will be fine. - Uh, they're in-- I got it. I got it. Her phone keeps going straight to voicemail. And I, I don't care about the wedding. I don't care. Please tell her. I-I don't care. We don't even have to get married if she just comes back. She wants to marry you, Scott. That wasn't the thing. - She does? - Yes. She said that she would have said yes if you'd have asked in your boxers while sitting in the couch with cereal in your mouth. Yes, she does. But I ruined it. [sighs] She's a simplicity loving oddball. The hand-stamped place cards were a bit much. It's too late? Maybe. But if that's your person, you have to try. It can't get much worse. She's my person. Hey, what're you doing, man? Don't embarrass yourself. Shh. She's sleeping. You should take him home. Let's go. And watch your step. [sighs] Nate. I thought about what you asked... and I can't explain the why part. A... An extreme moment of weakness and... beer. Any excuse sounds pathetic, so I won't excuse it. But... I do think it was wrong... and it'll never happen again. I respect that. But... I don't wanna... I don't wanna do the same as before. I wanna keep in touch. I can't do that. I, uh, if I need to let go, I-I will. I've gotten used to that, but... I can't just pretend to be friends. [sniffles] Okay. [sniffles] What's going on? [chuckles] Ah, Scott just had too much to drink and he tried to climb in through April's window and there was this whole thing and... - He's, he's fine now. - No. [clears throat] I mean, what's going on with you and Nate? Every time I see you guys, you're upset. You're acting weird. - It's just wedding stress. - No, it's not. N... N-Nate and I... While Seth was away... we got very close. It almost went too far, but it never did. But it could have. So we stopped talking and we ended it... and I just waited for Seth to come back... but he never came back. And this, this was years ago? Yes. - And you haven't talked since? - No. And the feelings are gone? No. Okay. [clears throat] Are you coming to bed? What? It's late. We have to be up before seven tomorrow. I... Aren't you up-upset or... Nope. Feelings are feelings, they change. We'll be home in a day and I'll know you'll feel... a little more sorted out. Uh, uh, sorted out? I just told you that I feel-- Yeah, I know you feel. [sighs] You feel a lot sometimes. And I understand that. I do. Uh, the sad stuff, I get that. I do. No, you don't. I do. You're sad, I know. And I'm doing my best to juggle this all but I, I don't understand how you expect the condo to get finished, which won't happen if I lose this deal. And-and your family to get the needed face time and us to have time and-and... I can't take care of everything all the time, Erica. Marc. I don't think this is working. [sighs] [cell phone vibrates] [indistinct chatter on TV] [clears throat] Anything good? [sighs] It's the real somethings of somewhere. And some movie where everybody dies. Hm. I wanna take you somewhere. Will you come with me? Where? It's a surprise. Then definitely no. [sniffs] Marc and I broke up. If you do this one thing for me I promise we'll both come back here and watch "Moonstruck" on repeat. Okay. Yeah, okay. [April] So did Marc leave already? [Erica] Yeah, he left last night. I'll probably catch a flight first thing tomorrow morning. But you don't wanna stay for Homefront? I need to get back, find a new apartment. [sighs] Okay, what is going on? Why are we here? Why are you torturing me? Do you trust me? Hm. Fine. Okay, seriously. Why are we here? [chuckles] April, it took me 16 years... to build up the courage to ask you out... followed by another three for you to agree to it. Okay. I knew before we ever went on that first date that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you. You're everything. And I can't imagine my life without you. So if you'd give me a chance... I'd like to beat you every night at "Jeopardy" for the rest of our lives. [chuckles] It never happened and it never will. [laughs] April Anne Moore... will you marry me? Yes. [laughs] - Okay, just one second. - Okay. Wait. Right now? What, what is going on? [laughter] Friends and family, welcome. You have been chosen to share in today because each of you in some way have touched the lives of these two. Love goes beyond romance and feelings. But the feelings that you have and the friendship will protect these treasured parts of your union. You're better together than you are apart. My sleep talker my spider catcher you're my best friend... and talking to you at the end of the day is my favorite part one hundred percent of the time. [chuckles] [sighs] Therefore with God's blessing and the power vested in me I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss your bride. [all cheering] ♪ I was in love with the whole affair ♪ ♪ She's been leaving me upside upside down ♪ ♪ Feelin' high and turned around ♪ ♪ She's been leaving me upside upside down ♪ ♪ Like a dime story ♪ ♪ Over and over ♪♪ - Cheers. - Cheers. Excuse me. [indistinct chatter] You have hay on your tux. Good one. See how happy they look? You could be happy like that. - Oh, stop. - Okay. You gonna eat your ice cream? I'm not... going to halfway finish this thing. Left shoulder is drama, right shoulder is comedy. Yeah, exactly. [laughs] I'm gonna miss you, daddy. Well, uh, you know we just want you to be happy. Wherever that is. ♪ I can't see you ♪ ♪ I can't get your sound ♪♪ Thanks for coming. - Thank you. Have a good night. - Great seeing you. - Bye-bye. - Bye. Bye-bye. [sighs] - Oh, sweetheart. - Mom. - Mm, see you in a bit. - See you back home. Okay. Thank you for this. Thank you. It's teamwork. Hm. Where's Marc? Gone. Uh, I have to be back in Chicago in the morning, so... I just, uh... I just didn't wanna leave without saying goodbye. Oh. Sure. Best of luck... tomorrow. Let me know h-how I can contribute in any way, financially or, whatever. Ha. I could just talk to Melanie about that. [sighs] Okay. Okay. Okay. [instrumental music] [sobs] [laughs] [chuckles] I love you. [sighs] [sighs] [sighs] I miss you so much. I am sorry. Oh, Seth, I'm so sorry. [sobs] [sniffles] [sighs] What the... What are you doing here? Unh-unh. What are you doing here? I was just... I just wanted to come see Seth's bench one last time 'cause I don't know when I'm coming back. So... you're not going to the ceremony? No, I have an early flight. Right. Well... that's maybe best. Look, I don't know how you're feelin' about maybe missin' Seth's dedication. None of my business. But for Nate... Look, you have every right to be there. But you hurt Nate. I don't like that. So, yeah. Maybe don't go. Or... And I'm just spitballin here 'cause this is the last time I'm gonna see you anyway, right? Leave Marc. Nice guy, but eh. See if there's maybe someone out there that maybe fits you better. Maybe someone who makes you stammer get all flushed... but also understands what it's like to miss Seth. To feel lost. But you're gonna have to look really hard to find someone like that. [sighs] Well... none of my business. What happened? Honey, you haven't changed. I heard about Marc. Is everything okay? I don't know. Is Marc already back in Chicago? I don't know. Do you need me to book your flight? I'm happy to make a call if you-- Mom, I already booked a flight. What about the condo? There wasn't already a down payment, was there? If it's within 30 days, you might be able to-- Mom, it's fine. Well, what's your plan when you get back? You'll have to find a place as soon as possible. [chuckles] Why? Huh? Why? Why the rush to find a new place? I can come to Chicago for a little bit just till you get yourself resituated. Let me see. I don't think I could make it out before-- Mom. Mom! Why are we rushing to find a new apartment? What's so important about a new apartment? Well, so what's your plan then? I don't know. Uh, um, I don't know. I don't know and I think... I think that's okay. [laughs] Oh. [Nate] And in these times one of you, sometimes even a stranger will show up and provide. Just, show up. And I think that's pretty rare nowadays. I'm sure each of you have experienced something like that too. S... Uh, so... let us not only be grateful to the ones that we miss. Steven, Kelsey... and Seth. But let's be grateful for this community, too because we've proven to be just that. And when we do have to let go... when it's time to say goodbye... we get through because of this. So, see you in the park. Enjoy these benches as much as a bench can be enjoyed. [laughs] And remember the heroes of this town. Thanks. That's, that's all I got. Thank you. - Erica, I thought that-- - Hi, I'm not sure what... - What? No, no, you-- - Um-- No, no, what were you gonna say? Uh... I, I don't... Okay, I don't know how this goes. Ah, okay, I don't know what I'm doing. But, uh... Oh, I... Uh, what I'm trying to say is... Oh, I love you. I know I love you. That's pretty much all I know. And I know things are messy and it's now kind of a total f-freefall and I don't expect... I guess we'll stumble through together then. [instrumental music]
