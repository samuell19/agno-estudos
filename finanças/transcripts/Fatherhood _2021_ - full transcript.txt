Well, this fucking sucks. You haven't seen Matt, have you? I saw him go upstairs. - Hi, mom. - Hi. Don't dress me. You're gonna be okay. The both of you are gonna get through this, because the lord has a plan for you. No, mom, don't put on my shoe. You're just gonna pick yourself up, and be this wonderful, special guy you've always been. I don't need you to tie my shoe. Don't tie it, mom. We have to do this soon. - What do you mean by "soon"? - The baby's not due for another two weeks. Your amniotic fluid's low. Your daughter's already a healthy size, so let's get her out. - It's a girl. - I just heard her. I heard what she said. Oh, sorry. Were you waiting to find out? You would've knew that if you were our regular doctor, who chose this week of all weeks to go to Maui, which is insane. Why not go bodysurf? You know, it's just our first kid. Also she's still breech, so I wanna schedule a cesarean for this evening. - For this evening? - Mm-hm. I haven't even set up the crib. Are you serious? I knew I should've taken care of it. You told me to take it off my list. I wanted you to take it off your list. I'm handling it. I got it. That's really reassuring. - Honey, I'm handling it. - Are you really ready for this? No. Who is really ready? What does that mean when you say, "are you really ready for this?" This evening? Can we do it tomorrow? I got a fantasy football draft. Um, me and some guys from work put a nice little pool together, and... I'm kidding. Why are you taking me seriously? Stop. Relax, honey. That's a good one. - All right. - You good? - Yeah. My hands started sweating. - I know. Why couldn't you give us adequate warning? We thought it'd be fun to surprise you. We said, "we should have this baby tonight and mess with Marion." - Love your sense of humor, Matt. - At least I got one. Bye-bye. Okay, mom, we'll call you as soon as it's over. I love you. No, no. Skype me while it's happening. - What? Mom. - Okay, now we're just being weird. I want to be in the room with my daughter and see my granddaughter when she enters the world. I'll be here to take care of her. Like you took care of cousin janey's baby? - Mom, that is ancient history. - Here we go. Not that ancient. You don't put a baby on your lap and then strap a seat belt over you in the passenger seat in an automobile driving to 7-Eleven. I know you don't hold a baby in your lap and strap a seat belt over you in a passenger seat of an automobile driving to 7-Eleven. - I know that. - Terrific. Skype me. Sweetie-pie, mommy will see you tomorrow. Okay, goodbye. Bye. Give daddy a kiss. And a kiss from mommy. Two kisses. Wake up. - Oh, my god. - I'm ready. I'm ready to dance. - Matt. Hey, man. - Hey. What's going on? Oh, stay away from that tuna casserole. The one in the middle. Tastes like ass. My mom made that casserole, so... It's really good. It's really... - It's got, like, a tang. - It's all right, man. - Like a tangy... - It's okay. Come here. - Matt. - Jordan, I don't... Come here. Nope, come here. Bring it in. You need this. Bring it in. Let it out. Breathe, breathe. Come on, man. Let me tell you something. That speech... Your speech. You went up there and you talked. I don't, um... I don't know what to say. I assumed you'd written something, but you said, "no, I'm freestyling this." Okay, we done? Because I can't do this right now. - Please. - No, nope, Matt. Look at me. You can. - Let me tell you why. - You're not listening. Remember camp winapoo? Remember we went to camp winapoo? - I do. - You got poison Ivy on your face. Your face started blistering, and it was bubbling, and the bumps. Then the bumps was popping, so you had pus coming out of your face? You looked crazy as hell. Then you came to lunch, right? Your crush was there. Marcy. You used to love Marcy. And when she saw him, she screamed. - And you was devastated. - Yeah. - But you got through that. - Yeah. - You got through that. - Because you're strong. And confident. And you will get through this too. This is so much worse than that. How is that the same? - What? I'm just trying... - Jordan. I'MMA punch you in the face. Don't say nothing else to me. I told you I can't. - I swear to god. - Why you balling up your fists? Swear to god. Stop. - How you feel? - Good. - It's gonna be okay, all right? - Okay. I love you so much. I love my anesthesiologist. Stop it. Stop playing. You're so beautiful. - Matt, Matt. - Yes, Marion. I can't see. Come on. You're doing great, Liz. Might wanna look away now, Matt. It's happening. I wanna look, but I don't wanna look. But I do wanna look. But I don't wanna look. You're doing great. Oh, my god. We're about to be parents. I love you. I love you too. - Okay? How we doing, doc? - Here she comes. - You see the baby? - I do. Oh, my god, Liz. And there she is. We got a baby. Um... I just wanted to, uh... Matt. You didn't have to. I know I didn't have to. I wanted to, because you deserve it. It's beautiful. Thank you. - Let me put it on you. - Thank you. You still have to do diapers. As long as they promise to change my diapers when I get old, I'm happy. - Love you. Thank you. - I love you. - How you feeling? - A little sore, but... - How are you doing, Liz? - I wanna see maddy. Hey. I thought you might. Matt, I'll need you to come around here and help me. - Gladly. - She's gonna be a bit wobbly. - Okay. - We're gonna take this slow. - Take your time. - Okay? - Let's get you to the chair. Easy, easy. - Ready for a 10k. You good? All right. I feel lightheaded. Take your time, honey. Take your... Shit. Liz. Liz. Liz. What's wrong with her? - Was she dizzy earlier? - I don't know. Liz. She's having trouble breathing. I'm gonna get some help. Medical emergency. Liz. Liz. Look at me. - Give her space. - What's wrong with her? I need an oxygen mask. - Liz. - Can you hear me? - I need you to step back now. - Wait. That's my wife. She collapsed. No precursory signs. - Liz. That is my wife. Wait. Liz. - Start the iv. I said, wait a minute, man. Liz. Wait a... Liz. Mr. Logelin. Hey, what's up, doc? What's going on, man? Your wife had a pulmonary embolism. - Uh... - A blood clot traveled to her lung. What does that mean? What's that mean? Don't tell me my wife is dead. - Don't tell me my wife is dead. - What? What? What? What is it? Is it maddy? What? Just... Matt. How? I would trade everything to spend one more day with you. Here she is. He's not ready for a baby. He hasn't even put the crib together. Well, you know he's always been extremely immature. Oh, hi, Matt, how are you, dear? I'm extremely immature. Can I get the baby, please? I just gave her a bottle. You know, maddy... If you could have only one parent, I wish you could've had your mom. She would've been better at it. Better sooner than later. I don't know. Mm-mm-mm. Mm-hm. I don't know how he gonna do this. See? Will you tell him that? Naw. All right, all right, maddy. Okay. You win. You win, maddy. Tell me what it is. Are you hungry? Huh? You want your diaper changed again? Okay, wait a second. Hold on. Hold on, maddy, okay? Here. All right. Okay. All right, all right. Wait, I didn't get it all. Oh, my 6... Shit. What are you doing up? I probably will never sleep again. What is that on that baby's bottom? It's a diaper. It looks like a balloon animal. Is it inside out? The diaper's on fine. I just came down to give her a bottle. Already done. We heard her crying. You wanna give her some? There you go. There you go. Matthew, darling, we've been talking... We think you should move back to Minnesota. It's financially prudent. You can find a job there. Your mom and I can help you raise maddy. We'll all be together. You'll have a church. A support system. - You're all alone here. - I'm not alone, okay? My job is here. There are no good tech jobs at home. My friends are here. Your friends are kind of weird. Okay, that may be true, but they're my friends, mom. Liz is here. And every place that I look here, every single place, makes me think of her. Mom, you always talk to me about god's plan. I'd love to know what the odds are of me meeting somebody from my hometown halfway across the country. God? I had a plan. Liz was to go away to grad school, and then come back and work and live. That was the plan before she met you. Now, you want to stay? Do that. But maddy comes with us. - Marion, it's... - It's the best thing for her. Believe it or not, it's best for you too. I care about you. You think you can do this, but you can't. Raising a child, that's a nonstop, all-day, all-night affair. I understand. And I'll... I'll think about it. Okay. I thought about it. Yeah, I just thought about it. You're right. Marion, you're right. I can't. I can't do it. But you know what? I'm gonna do it. Yeah, I'MMA do it. I'm gonna bring maddy up. I'MMA bring maddy up, because I'm her father. - And because I love her. - I know you love her. Do you know that I love her? I doubt that you really do. I have no doubt you love that baby. I have no doubt you loved my Liz. But you wanna keep maddy to yourself because you need a life raft. I'm sorry I messed up your plan. You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar. You catch even more with a flyswatter. Marion. If there's one piece of advice that I can give you about bringing up a kid... Letgo. Look, as a parent, we do all this shit. Right? Trying to make everything perfect. But we don't have any control. You just have to accept that fact. Liz loved you. And it made me happy to see that. And I also saw how much you loved her. You are a, um... You're a good father. She was lucky to have you, Mike. Thanks. I had an aunt who died this past year. She was 99. Wow, that, uh, must've been a shock. It was. Listen. I want you to take as much time... Okay. As you need. - Thank you. - Five weeks, six weeks, whatever. I'll probably need about ten... 20 years. - That would do, but I need my job. - Yeah. You know, so I can't have that time. Howard, I was thinking, maybe I could just work from home. And come in as you need me. And when I come in, I'd have to bring my daughter with me. - You're taking care of her? - That's correct. All right, good. Great, okay. You don't think I can do it. It's not that I don't think you can do it. - Because I'm a man? - No. What does a woman have that a man doesn't? Pafience. Emotional vulnerability. Breasts. Some men have breasts. I'll let that go, because you're grieving. Listen, I love babies. You know, I have three of them myself. They're not babies anymore in the pictures, but when they started, they were babies. And I'm telling you, it's brutal. It'll wipe you out. She have solid poops yet? I'm dealing with the creamy shit right now. Enjoy the creamy shit. It's a big jump. When you get to solid poops, it's not a picnic. Okay. Save that. Put it with your roses and your flowers. It's packed with nutrients, that stuff. That's... That's a great tip. - Yeah. - The London account. I know it's coming up in five weeks. I just wanna tell you, I'm on it. I'm more than capable of doing the job that needs to be done. But if you feel like I'm not, or I can't be, you could put Oscar on it. Jesus Christ, Oscar? - Yeah. - No, no, no. No, no, no. Forget Oscar. Did you ask him? Did you ask him, "do you want Oscar to handle the clients?" - Remember? Like we rehearsed? - I said it, Oscar. It worked. - Told you it would. That's great news. - Yeah. It's kind of cruel to send flowers to someone who's grieving. Because, you know, flowers die, and then you gotta throw them out. It's just such a bummer. You know, I've never seen, like, a person pass or anything. But, um, you know, I've seen a squirrel pass. It makes you wonder about the circle of life. But it's not really a circle. It's a line. - There's a beginning and there's an end. - Hey, Oscar. Can you stop talking? You sound just like my wife. You're gonna swaddle maddy, aren't you? Did you swaddle Liz? I sure did. Then, yeah. I'MMA do whatever Liz would want me to do. But this looks insane. I mean, that's tight there, Marion. You think she's gonna run away? What up? How you doing? These are flaming hots. Anybody want some? Grandmas? Want me to give one to the baby? Y'all looking good, ladies. Can I say that to you? Thank you. - No problem. - Stop it. - Your pajama-robe thingy. - Jordan. - Stop it. - What am I doing? - You're flirting with my mother. - I'm not. I'm looking at you flirt with my mom. I'm flirting with both your mamas. Hey, Marion. How you doing? Looking good. - Jordan. - Kind of a blouse-sweater. Jordan, stop it. I can't help your mom is a gilf. - That's it. - Yeah, I said it. I got a present for you. Can I give you a present? Wait right here. I'll be right back. I got something for you. We've been making a list. We need onesies. And you need a look. A toilet lock. They can drown in a toilet. Look, I've been meaning to ask. How long are you staying? I wish I didn't have to go back in two weeks... Not you, morn. We discussed that. But, Marion, I wasn't sure about you. Well, since you refuse to move back to Minnesota, I'll stay six months. - Six months. - Yes. - What about Mike? - I don't care about Mike right now. Hey, Matt. Hey, uh, Mike. How you doing, man? Doing well, man. Okay. - I want us to be honest for a second. - Okay, let's be honest. The first thing I wanna say is that I love having you here. I know you do. No, I love it. But what worries me is that if you're here... You know, if you're here for an extended period of time, we're gonna end up getting on each other's nerves. In just six months? I was thinking maybe you could leave when my mom leaves. What would I look like, going home before I know that you are capable of taking care of my newborn grandchild? How are you ever gonna know if you don't let me do it? That is a great damn point. Huh? Forty-love. Forty-love, Matt. Here you go, brother. Look what I got for you. Huh? What the hell is that? - I got you a pet. - That's a goldfish. Let me tell you something. Kids with pets are really happy. Also they don't get any allergies. Did you know that? That's cats and dogs. - Damn it, you read the same article. - Okay, Jordan, this is... All right, I'm bullshitting you, man. I'm sorry, excuse my French. I hate this fish. You remember Tanya? She gave me this fish. Tanya broke up with me and left this dirty-ass fish in my house. Can you take me to the baby store? Hell, yeah. Team single father. I'm here to help you at the end of the day. Thank you. Okay, Marion, how about we do this? How about when you go back, right, I promise to give you updates, let you know how maddy's doing? I'll post pictures on my Instagram all the time. All right. I will go home when Anna goes. But if you are not handling everything all very well, you move your butt back to Minnesota. - Why would I agree to that? - Because it's not about you. Brother, real quick. You good on the fish? I don't want the fish, man. - How you doing? - Good, and you? I'm doing fine. Here you go. These are great. Oh, well... You better stop smiling at me like that. Here you go. I don't have no kids. This for my friend. This is for his baby. He's buying all this stuff. He's paying for everything. Oh, here we go. This is, uh, your diaper rash ointment for you. This one's maddy's. Just do his separate. Here, just put yours over there, so she knows that you have to pay for the stuff that you got for your problem by yourself. This one's the one I'm paying for, for maddy. - That's yours. This is maddy's. - Okay. He says, situa... I mean... - Bumps. - Bumps, but it's shaving bumps. - On your butt. - Not on my butt. - I have shaving bumps from shaving, and... - On your... And I saw a video that people use diaper rash ointment to keep they skin clear from gaining shaving bumps. - That's why I got such a smooth neck. - You look great. I look great. Look at that. She said I look great. Ask to see his butt. "Now insert the eighth 44-mm screw." I don't see it. I don't see the eighth 44-mm screw. I don't see it. You're not even looking for real. Look next to your shoe. - Okay. - Why do you keep acting like you're dumb? Because I didn't see it, I'm acting like I'm dumb? You acting like a dumb motherfudger. - Don't cuss in front of my child. - I didn't. I called you a motherfudger. Why are you saying "fudge"? There's a baby. I don't wanna curse in front of the baby. - Why not just choose another word? - I did. Fudge. Man, you know, your daddy is a witch. Yeah, I said it. He's a dumb-ass witch. Goofy motherfudger. See? It's not... - Just reach under and flip the switch. - I did. It's broken. You've always been so impatient. This ain't got nothing to do with Patience. I'm telling you. I'm trying to do it. I can't. I can't, morn. Shit. I can't do none of it. I can't do it. Not without Liz. You just have to do what's best for her. That's all you have to do the rest of your life. And I believe you can do that. Right here. Show-off. I'll pray for you ten times a day. Listen, if it's nine, don't kill yourself. Okay? I love you, morn. Say "bye, Nana." - Come, come, come. - You got her? We have a deal. If it's in her best interest, you're moving back, okay? No being selfish. Agreed. - Love you. - Good luck, Matt. I love you, maddy. Grammy loves you. Bye. Oh, hey, hey, hey. Daddy in a sling. - How I look? - You look great. Like a king. Don't say it just to be saying it. You look like a king. - You gotta buckle it. - Push it down. - I'm pushing it. - I'm pushing my side down. - So buckle it. - No, it's still wobbly. Fellas. Okay, have you even attached the third anchor latch? Oh, my god. Oh, no, no, no. Maddy. I'm sorry. Daddy's sorry. Booyah, come on. That's in there. That's sturdy. - Thank you. - I was a nanny for four years. Wait, wait, wait. What? - She's awake. - No, she ain't. Yes, she is. I just heard her. - I don't have a bottle, man. - Oh, man. Here's the formula. All right? You just cut the top. You were so hungry. You were so hungry. Hiyo. Oh, where's mom? Mom's an astronaut training at NASA. Where's mom today? Mom is serving time in San Quentin. Where's her mom? Me, I can't wait till Monday comes, so I can get away from my kids' screaming. Wow, I bet they're probably psyched to get away from you too. We brought you some flowers. Oh, I thought I should tell you, you got one of your wishes. I'm changing a lot of diapers. This little kid here poops a lot. Mm-hm. Mm. Cute baby, papi. - Hey, you mind if I...? - Yeah, sure. - Thanks, man. - All right. Maddy, we're about to pass the school that your mom would've wanted you to go to. Which means that that's where you're gonna go. They got nuns there. And you'll like nuns. Because nuns dress like penguins. That's a fact. And they're celibate. I know. I know. I know. You fussing. You don't wanna be celibate, but you're gonna be. Good talk. Come on, maddy. What, what, what? Roller coaster. Come on, maddy. Here it is. Going down this track. Going down. It's getting rocky and shocky. No, mom, listen to me. You don't understand. I'm serious. It's just, like, she will not stop crying. She won't. Sometimes I sang you a little lullaby. That would quiet you right down. Try to sing higher. It's not working. Oh, no, that... No, that made it worse. Well... She's not a clapper. She just won't stop. Listen to your daddy. Your daddy said go to bed, maddy. Your father is tired. - That's not abuse. That's not abuse. - Eh. That's borderline. My nipples are so cracked, I'm scared to even look at them. Is it weird that breastfeeding kind of turns me on a little bit? My husband wants sex. I just want him to die. Is that wrong? No. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Aa is down the hall to the right. I'm not here for that. I'm not here for the aa meeting. That's not why I'm here. She, uh, just went to sleep, but she's been, like, crying for hours. I mean, hours. To the point where I'm exhausted. And my face hurts, and I'm getting frustrated. And I don't know how to break the stroller down. I don't know how to fold it up. Okay, well, sorry, but this is a group for new mothers. You're lying. On that sign out there, it says "parents." I'm a parent and I don't know what the hell I'm doing. I don't have nobody else to talk to about this shit. Speaking of shit, the girl's got some stuff flying out her ass. It's like a firehose. I don't know if it's normal, but it's two different kinds. She can either hit you with a streamer. That's when it's all put together. And it's a little solid. And it's a direct hit. Or she'll buckshot you. And that's that spray. It's a quick: Whop. I need help. I need the crying to stop. How do I make the crying stop? Okay, um, my oldest had colic for the first couple of months. What's colic? It's when babies cry for hours on end without any reason, till you feel like your eyes will pop out. I gave the baby colic. No, that's not how colic works. I'm not washing my hands and I'm just touching the baby. That's how I gave the baby colic. You don't give a baby colic. It's more of a digestive thing. That's a relief. Thing that worked for me was white noise, surprisingly. White noise? White noise. And then looking ahead, I'm gonna turn it over to Matt. He'll show you how this can work for your customers. All right, Matt, you're up. - Matt. - Matt. I'm not sleep. Sleep. No, this guy never sleeps. He's deep in thought. Yeah, deep in... that's exactly what it is. Very deep in thought. Thank you. Thank you, Howard. And the reason why is because I'm so excited. - Yeah. - About this. With this upgrade, there's thousands, and I mean thousands, of preset visuals, from flooring, to walls, to lighting, that really offers... You hear crying? Crying? I don't hear any crying. I have a deviated septum, so my nose whistles. Maybe that's it? No, that's not what it is. I'm sorry. Excuse me for a second, please. - Whoa, hey. Where, uh...? - Sorry, sorry, sorry. Here we go. Here we go. - Huh? Huh? - Vacuum, yeah. We're gonna vacuum. We're gonna vacuum. Hey, maddy. - This vacuum sucks. - Hey. Whoa, whoa. What's going on? What's going on now? What are you doing? - What's it look like? - He's doing the vacuum thing. Here, let me take her. She likes the vacuum noise. Hey. Hi. Matt's got a baby. Hey, I apologize for storming out like that. But she goes on these crying jags. It's impossible to get her to calm down. Does she wanna try sucking on my pinkie? - It used to help with my kids. - Howard, no. - They loved it. - Not sanitary. Maybe this will help, mate. It's, um, a white noise app. - It helps me sleep. - Thank you. My baby always calmed down with skin-to-skin contact. She's 25 now. I want you to notice the easy map-tree interface. It's giving our customers what they want, which is simplicity. Right? Isn't that what you want, hmm? They want simplicity. I got a problem now. This is a place of business. Right? It's not a place of babies. In here, I'm kind of... I'm the designated asshole. Who designated you? I'm just asking. Was it from birth? Hey, you don't think there's an asshole above me? And above that asshole, another asshole. - An asshole chain. - It's an asshole chain. Exactly what it is. Yeah? Just wanted to say, great presentation, Matt. Definitely memorable. We'll be talking this week. Thank you for that. It means a lot, especially since I'm about to get fired. No. We'll be in touch. Thank you, Fiona. See you. Go on. Finish. Hey, you're not that lucky. I'm not firing you. I just happen to be worried about you. When's the last time you had a break? There's a new thing called babysitters. Oh, hi, maddy. My name is summer. I'm going to pick you up now. She doesn't speak English yet. She's just a baby. Oh. I believe you have to treat the infant with respect. Right, maddy? We've got this. Yeah, yeah. That's it. All daddies deserve some time off. Have some fun. You got a babysitter. Have a good time. You need this, bro. You a single parent now. Which is crazy to me to say this. Matt is a dad. To say that out loud still sound... Matt is a dad. - That is crazy. So insane. - That's crazy. - Hey. - What are you doing? - I ain't doing nothing. I'm listening. - Are you serious right now? - What? - What do you mean? What was that? You don't see the diversity just walked past? Huh? All the flavors. For all of us. Okay, I gotta get going, man. I'm going home. Matt. - Excuse me. Excuse me. - Matt, Matt. - Hey, Matt. - What, man? - What's up? Where you going? - What do you mean? Home. - Why you leaving? - I'm not having a good time. You're not having fun? We got girls, we're taking shots... I don't care about no girls. You think I care about girls right now? I brought you out to have a good time. I don't want your version of a good time, Jordan. I don't want it. I get it, you haven't been out since Liz... Shut the... hey, man. Don't. Don't do that. Don't bring Liz up. Don't do that. Idiot. - Say bye. - Bye. Good bye. We're never gonna see her again, are we? All we need is us. We don't need no one else. Here come Javier. That's daddy new best friend. He brings us our formula, our diapers. He gives us everything we need. We don't have to talk to people ever again. If anybody else ring this bell, they die. Hear me? I say, if anybody ring daddy bell, they gonna die. I said, no ringing. I said, no ringing the damn bell. I'MMA kill somebody. Good morning. - Hi. - Hey. - Where's my grandbaby? - What are you...? Is she dressed? - What are you doing here, Marion? - It's maddy's pediatrician visit. Oh, shit, is it Thursday already? You didn't forget the pediatrician's visit, did you? Didn't forget anything. You just caught me. We was about to leave. She just got out of the tub. You left her in the tub? Good. Yeah. How's she been eating? I mean, okay, I guess, you know? She, um... For the most part, it's fine. Once in a while, if she sleeping, I let her go a extra hour or something. How about you? How are you doing? It's not really about me. How is maddy? Is she okay? Look, I know I ain't perfect. I know that. Urn... I'm actually nothing. I'm a joke, okay? Matt, you're not a joke. Maddy is doing great. She's moved up to the 60th percentile in weight and 70th in height. You can start feeding her when she's hungry. I hope you don't mind me saying this, but your wife would be very proud of you. It's okay, Marion. It's all right. - You hungry? Wanna go get lunch? - Uh... No, no. Actually, I gotta get back to the airport. - Already? - Yeah, yeah. I told Mike that I was spending the day at the spa. You told...? Want me to take you? I can give you a ride. No, she needs to get to her little nap. You want a little nap? Oh, god. Matthew, today was a good day for you, as a parent. You keep all these little victories like you had today in a little box inside you. They'll be your most prized possessions. And don't let me have to come back up here, before father Mayfield is going to christen her in Minnesota. St. augustine's, three weeks. See you there. - Wait, what do you...? - Minnesota, three weeks. See you. - Minnesota? - Grammy loves you, maddy. Nobody said nothing to me about Minnesota. Who finished their whole bottle? You did. Yes, you did. You were hungry. Huh? "I'm hungry, daddy." It's her first flight. I never would've guessed. - She's a cutie. - Yeah. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. I'm so sorry. Hey. - What a bundle of joy. - Oh, my sweetheart. Good? Good? Come on, now. Anna, come on, let's get something cold to drink. Remember when I caught you guys messing around in here? Oh, my goodness. Yes, I do. You chased me with Mike's hockey stick. You kept yelling out, "not in this house. Not in this house." You thought you were gonna get lucky that night. You got damn lucky, didn't you? It's amazing what you can do when you're scared. I've never been that fast. The room looks different. I brought a lot of things down from the attic. From her childhood. I like it. I like it a lot. At first, I spent whole days in here. Whole days. Just lying on the bed. Smelling the pillows. Crying. Pissed. I'm down to one hour each day. That's all I allow myself now. I'd like for you to let maddy come and stay with us sometimes. When she's bigger. She could spend summers here. Summers? Matt, she needs family. She'll need a woman in her life. And I don't mean some woman you met in the club. Or on tinders. "Tinders"? I'm not on tinder. And what do you...? How do you know about tinder? Where are you getting this stuff? Hey, I'm... You think maybe you can watch maddy for me tonight? Yeah. Yes. Just wanna go meet up with some friends, go have a drink. - Yeah, you do that. - All right. - Yeah. - Okay. Thank you. Mom. Did dad like having a baby? Oh, he loved babies. That's why he had so many with so many different women. Yeah, but he married you. Yes, lucky me. I was lucky, because I had you. I hope I can be half as good a mom as you were with me. You're a good morn. Come in. Wake up, daddy. It's a school day. - Wake up. - I'm up. You gotta treat it like... Like you're sneaking up on it. And grab it. Over. Over. Okay. Okay, that's one. Just let me... What is this? I think it's a new... a new... a new look. I think it's a new hairstyle that can catch on if given a chance. Just stay still. We gotta go top. Let me... Hold on. Okay? All the girls are wearing skirts. But skirts make me feel like I forgot my pants. But she said it's a rule. Rules? We don't need no stinking rules. - [9iggles} - Do you like going to school here? Mommy wanted me to be here. I like it. That's all I needed to hear. All right, go ahead. - Love you. - Love you too. Two kisses. Forehead, forehead. I got you. - Bye, daddy. - Bye. - Good morning. - Good morning. Mr. Logelin, we need to discuss the dress code. You have a good day, okay? There's a dress code here. Maddy, it's on you. You wanna check or bet? Allin. - All in again. - All in again? - I'm gonna go ahead and fold. - Fold like a chump. - She looks serious. - Yeah. - I don't know if she's bluffing or not. - Seriously. Let me see your face. That's a poker face right there. That's a poker face. How can you break that down? You can't. I don't know what you got going on in that head. I can see into the mind of maddy. Hold on. I got nothing, guys. I'm out. I fold. I'm going all in. You kidding me? Look at this. Bam, queens. - What do you have? - What do you got? - Aces. - What? What? No. Pocket rockets. - Pocket aces. - Okay. - That was a good hand. It's all yours. - She's got rockets. - Scoop it. - What? - It's yours. - That's all you. This is all mine. - Go ahead. Take it. - You're not gonna eat all of that today. Ship it. There you go. Did you eat your veggies? What is that, cake? They're having so much fun. Makes you wish you had a kid to bring. Oh, I do. Crazy one's mine. That's maddy. Hi, daddy! - Hey. - Cannonball! Are you Matt? I am Matt. I think I know why Oscar and Rose insisted I come today. I think we're being set up. - Oh, wow. - I told them to stop trying. Funny thing is, I said the same thing to them. - Yeah? - We should mess with them. Throw your drink in my face. Make it look real bad. Or we could break up with them as friends. You know what? I've been looking for new white people. I have. I really have. There's plenty here, so... - What do you do? - Uh, I'm an animator. An animator? That's cool. That's different. I, uh, work with this guy. I work with Oscar. - That's my name. - Hey. Don't wear it out. I'm kidding. You can say it as much as you want. So you two meeting at Oliver's birthday party. - Pretty great. - What are the odds? What are the odds, you know? I mean, you know, you're great, and you're great. And it's just, uh... - It's not a setup, though. - Got it. - Very smooth, by the way. - Yeah. - Thank you. - Yeah. Great. Thank you. Hi, Rose. Hi, Rose. Unreal. My name's Liz. Stop playing. Um, I'm not playing. My name is... Well, Lizzie is what my friends call me. You're an animator. What have you animated? I work on a show called lucky Jim. Lucky Jim, I know what that is. Maddy loves that show. You let her watch lucky Jim? Yeah, it's a cartoon. Have you ever watched it? It's called lucky Jim because he gets lucky. - You talking about sex? - Ah-hah. I thought he was a leprechaun. Yeah, he's a leprechaun. A really lucky, really horny leprechaun. Is there a warning on it that kids shouldn't watch it? There's definitely a warning. You know where the pot of gold is? The pot of gold is right over there. And now that rainbow's up and disappeared. I think you're full of horse blarney. I'd like to show you what I'm full of, me Lassie, if you've no objection. I've no objection to plucking the clover out of you. I'm seeing stars. You will be seeing more than stars in a moment. That's it. - Oh, that's off. - Daddy, they were about to wrestle. I know that. And that's a little too violent for you to watch, honey. - Wait, did you call her? - Zip it. - What you mean? - Zip it. Don't be a bonehead. - Why I gotta be a bonehead? - Don't be a bonehead. - Maddy can handle it. - What'd I just ask you to do? Handle what? - Jordan, what I say? - Look, I got this. - Jordan... - That's what friends are for. I got you. Sometimes two adults meet each other. Right? And they fall in love. And they both are nearsighted. Have that in common and all these beautiful things. And they take long walks in the park together. You find that special someone. But then they get real petty one day, and kick you in your back. Because you snoring while you sleep. - What? - Now you're sleeping on the floor. - You're all messed up. - What? - Carpet burns on your arms. - That's enough. - It's not enough. - It is enough. You don't know if you're gonna find that special someone. You're not talking about nobody but yourself. - You know he's talking about himself? - I know. But if they liked each other, and then they didn't like each other, couldn't they like each other again? And wouldn't that be fun? - Yeah, maddy. - Whoa. Give me a high five or something. A hug. Come here. - I mean... - You are brilliant. You a genius. Gotta be to make sense of all that stuff you said. Don't be a hater. You are so smart. You definitely don't get that from your daddy. How come you wear boys' pants? Okay, stay together. No running. Hey, maddy. Are you a boy? Are you a girl? Zip it, bonehead. Madeline. I don't understand this. The kid was teasing her. You should talk to that kid's parents. I have. But he was teasing her because she was the only girl wearing pants. What if a boy wanted to come to school dressed in a skirt? Then that's that boy's business. It's the 21st century. Mr. Logelin, Madeline is in kindergarten. She doesn't have a mother to model after. I am well aware of what my daughter doesn't have. You have to at least show her that wearing girls' clothing is an option. I just don't understand why nuns are so tough. Why are you guys so tough? Like, what is it that happens in nun camp that makes you guys this strict? I won't say anything else. I don't wanna get struck down by lightning. Okay, here you go, maddy. - What about these here? - No. I want these. - You want those? - Yeah. Okay, if that's what you want. Are you going out? Yes. Rose is coming over. And daddy's gonna go out. With Oscar. No, not with Oscar. With Jordan? No, not with Jordan. A lady? Yes, it's a lady. Does that bother you? - Does it bother you? - I asked you first. Is it sister Kathleen from school? No, it is not sister Kathleen from school. Then that's okay. Who is it? It's a lady friend from the birthday party. You know what? I got a surprise for you. I was gonna wait till you got older. This was mommy's jewelry box. What I want you to do, I want you to pick something out of here that can be just for you. Anything? Anything you want. Hmm. This one. Wow. I like this one. Such a good choice. Such a good choice. Let me put it on you. Is she in this? Mommy? Yeah, she's in there, she's in you, she's in me. She's in... She's in whoever she touched. What did she say to that? Oh, she said, her mom is in her because of DNA. - What? - Yeah, I swear to god. Is she some kind of genius? You know what it is? Maddy just asks a lot of questions. I took her to this mummy show. They were talking about DNA. So I tried to explain to her what DNA was. And in doing that, she just... What? I'm surprised you're still single. All those hot single moms at the kiddie park. Stop it. Stop. There's nothing hot about single parents. We are ovennorked, sleep-deprived, covered in baby vomit. - That's hot. - That's hot. - It's hot. - All of that stuff is hot. You're funny. You're very funny. You've just been through a lot. You and maddy. We have been through a lot. But we're okay, you know? We, uh... We're on our own, but we're fine. I get that, you know. I'm on my own and I'm fine too. I like where I'm at. - Yeah? - Uh-huh. So you, um, must have had a good example of how to be a dad. No. No, I did not. I had the complete opposite of that. I know what not to do because of my dad. I'm gonna kiss you now, okay? Okay. I think I'm prepared. Oh, do you prefer my false teeth in or out? Leave them in, just in case I mess up. - So I got something to blame it on. - True. Does it bother you that my name is Lizzie? But you can change it if you want to. Okay. You know, if you wanna call me anything like your highness... Or, like, my mom was gonna name me majesty. Anything along those lines is great. - Okay, noted. - Mm-hm. What about Hank? What about Hank? Why? You said, anything I wanted. - Okay. - Okay? - We'll test it out. - Let's test it out now. Is that a deal? Okay, we'll test it out. Go. Go get in the house safe, Hank. Oh, my god. - Thanks for a good time, Hank. - Hank. - Good night. - No, all right, stop it. That's enough. Thank you. Good night. Wow. Wow, wow, wow. Hey. - You're late. - What do you mean, I'm late? You told Rose you'd be home at 11. Well, guess what. It is 11:13 right now. Yeah, late. All right. That is not that late. Hey, Rose. - Hey. I swear I put her to bed. - Did you? What are you gonna do? Huh? Ground me because I'm late? Huh? Is that what you gonna do? You ground your dad because he's late? - Yes, yes. - There you go. - Good. - Are your shoes tied? I don't think his shoes are tied. - Hey, maddy. - Where's daddy? Oh, um... Yeah, so your dad had to work late. But, um, we wanted to come and watch you play, and then maybe get some ice cream aftennards. Because he's not doing anything fun with anyone. And I am telling you the truth. I'm gonna walk you through how our software can help you redesign every aspect of your new mall. You gotta see... what? What's going on? Stop it. Sorry. It's bring your kid to work day. Imagine the madhouse... - No, it's not. - Yes, it is. - Let's go out. - No. Wait a second. Stop it, maddy. Stop. We are... we're... I've got your keys. I'm gonna throw them out the window. Give me the keys. Stop. What are you doing? What's your favorite movie? His girl Friday. Okay, that's a great movie. Um... bringing up baby. Let me think more recent. Let me think, like, not before the 1940s. Ask me mine. - What's your favorite movie? - I'm gonna git you sucka. Dad, dad, dad! What is that? No, I thought there was something on the window. No, I don't fall for your tricks no more. What? I thought something was on the window. I'm not gonna trick you. There's a booger on your shirt. Take it off now. Take it off now. Take it off now. Before we eat, I gotta tell you something. I gotta tell you something important. So Saturday night, I gotta go out. But Jennifer's mom said you can stay the night. Why can't I come with you? You can't come with me because I gotta do a bunch of grown-up stuff. - All right? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. Okay, baby, it's time to go to bed. Are you gonna sleep in those? You should take them off. Okay, hop in. Okay, good night, baby. Good night, sweetie. Mommy loves you. Good night, maddy. - You wanna go back to my place? - For what? You wanna play some poker? I don't know how to play poker. But I was thinking something even more fun than that. Wow. Is it twister? It's a form of twister. Okay. All right. Okay. Now that I have this information, I wanna be honest. Okay. I just wanna make sure that, um... - That I'm keeping maddy... - First. - Yes, like, she has to be the priority. - I know. You know? - I understand. - That's... I really do. I get it. Okay. It's part of what I like about you. Well... Then maybe I should teach you how to play poker. Wow, this is amazing. I know, right? It's gonna be so much fun. Hey, y'all gotta stop it. That's enough. Hey, slow it down. Let's go. It's way too loud in here. This is loud. You okay, maddy? - Yes. - Yeah? Yeah? Hey, y'all gotta turn this... Ifstooloud. Come on, stay close. Dad, you hit the clown! Oh, my god. He okay, maddy. Yeah, yeah. - Thank you. - Thank you. Come on, give me your hand. Give me your hand, honey. What an amazing day, huh? It's like the best day ever. I feel like nothing can mess up a day like this. - It was so perfect. - It was very fun. Yeah. I wanted, um... I wanted to talk to you. Can I talk to you? - Yeah. I wanna introduce you to somebody that I've been seeing. It's like a... It's like a friend I got, who I've been dating. I've been dating... A friend, right? That I've been... that I've been seeing. But I think that you would like her. - Daddy? - Yeah. Can I have a lollipop? Absolutely. Yeah. Let's get you some more stuff. Some more candy, okay? Maybe you take one home, and we finish this talk. Okay, but I don't want to meet anyone. Hey, come here. Come here, maddy. Come here. - Why? - Hey. - Hey. - How are you? - Good. How you doing? - Good. Maddy, this is Lizzie. Hey. Well, you can call me swan. Or dude. Or butthead. You guys wanna go to the tea party thingy? You wanna do that? After 15 minutes I heard they throw the tea in the water, which could be cool. - Mm. - Yeah. I'm super ambivalent too. I do hear there's a cool spiders exhibit in this kids' museum. Wanna do that? - I like tarantulas, but we already went. - Yeah. - Okay, how about we wing it. Yeah? - Okay. - Let's wing it, swan. - Let's wing it. This is nice. You guys are... Right? This is cool. - Look at that over there. - Too soon. - Yes. - Whoa. Whoa! When the boat comes, hit them with a wave. Ready? Hit them with a wave. There you go. See that? - See how cool that is? - Yeah. I used to play with these ducks when I was little. Hi, Billy. Hi, Bella. That was your favorite and that was your favorite. - Duck, duck, duck... - Oh, my goodness. Oh... ow. - Goose. - Oh. Oh! Let me do a solo. Solo, yes. - You wanna draw the castle? - Yeah. - What color? - Hmm. - Purple and black. - Ooh. And blue. That'll be great. Maybe in the middle, you could, like, add some fire or something. - Totes. - You know? Oh, wow. - Hey. - Hey, swan. You like it? This is, uh... This is something. Maddy, I don't know if we can keep this going, though. Why not? Well, because they're walls. Our house isn't the house for this. Grandma's house, those walls are the walls you wanna write on. All her walls are white. Are you visiting your grandma soon? - Yeah. It's her birthday. - Oh, nice. Is swan still here? Yes. - She's in the hallway. - Is she gonna stay here? Not tonight. She wanted to come tell you good night. Is that okay? - Swan? - Mm-hm? Hey, maddy. So I had a blast today. Did you have fun? Is she gonna sleep in your bed when she does sleep here? No, yuck, yuck. - No, I think that's disgusting. - Ick. Yeah, yuck to that. She'll sleep in the bathtub. You can borrow a pillow if you want. That is so nice. That'll make it more comfortable. - So generous. - Yeah. You should take some notes. Night, maddy. Good night. Get some rest. You forgot the two kisses. I almost did. That's one from me. And... That's a big one from mommy. Okay? I love you. Get some sleep. - You okay? - Um... No, I just forgot something. I'm a little upset at myself. Um... thank you. You were great with her today. Please. It was easy. Maddy is fantastic. Maybe you could come over to my place in the morning after dropping maddy off? You might get a little lucky if you bring me a latte. Okay. Mr. Logelin... I gotta get out of here. It's late. Sorry. Here we have a rule that all girl students wear skirts. Rules? We don't need no stinking rules. That's what my dad says. Okay, well, your daddy signed a paper when you were first accepted at this school. And he agreed to follow the rules. Sister Kathleen would like you to follow the rules and wear this skirt starting today. Are those boys' undennear? Maddy wears boys' undennear. Everyone, look. - Maddy wears boys' undennear. - Look, boys' undennear. Boys' undennear. - Zip it, Darren. - You zip it. I'm warning you, Darren. Boys' undennear. Cannonball! I want my daddy! Where's daddy? We're still trying to reach him. Maddy logelin. Thank you. Maddy. Maddy? Daddy. Hey. Oh, my god, maddy. Hey. Hey, babe. Oh, let me see, let me see. - Mr. Logelin, I... - Please. Please. How you doing, huh? I'm sorry, daddy. What? You're sorry? No. You don't have to be sorry. Dad. Daddy's sorry. Okay, come on, we're leaving. - Let's go. - Sir, sir, wait. - No. - Wait, sir, she needs stitches. No, listen to me. We're not doing anything here. You guys don't do nothing right. I've been here. No, thank you. Come on. She's gonna have a substantial scar if she doesn't get stitches. Look at me. You're so strong. Such a strong little girl. Okay? I'm proud. Guess who else is proud. Mommy would be proud right now. We're gonna go get some stitches, okay? Squeeze my hand, that's all. There you go. Mm-hm. Good job, maddy. You're doing good. - Hey. - Hey. I've been calling. Is she all right? Yeah, but... Sorry I didn't pick up. I'm just a little upset. I feel like I should've been there sooner. You can't blame yourself. It was an accident. I actually can. I can blame myself because I wasn't there. Anything could've happened to her. - She could've lost her eye. - She didn't. - She could've. - But she didn't. Can I, um...? Can I see her? I brought her this guy. It's very sweet. I think she's sleeping, though. I just think that right now, she's not ready. Ready for what? For this. She's not ready for this. This. - She's not ready, or you're not ready? - Look. Swan, the hospital that I was at today, it's the same hospital that Liz died in. I mean, thank god today I got there in time to hold her hand. With Liz, it was different. With Liz, I didn't get to hold her hand. I got shoved out the room. I got shoved out the room, and when I came back, she was gone. She was gone, and there was a tube sticking out of her mouth. Matt. I am so sorry that happened to you. It didn't happen to me. That's the problem. It did not happen to me. - Okay. - So don't be sorry. Don't be sorry for me. Okay, I'm, um... I'm gonna go. Would you give maddy my love, please? What's going on? What's wrong? I can't find mommy's necklace. What do you mean, you can't find it? Did you misplace it? I don't remember. You don't remember? You think it came off when you fell on the playground? Maybe. Okay, all right. Hey, hey, hey. It will come up. All right? - I need you to go to Croatia. - Croatia? Yeah, just for a month. Just set up the office there. That's all. Why don't you send Oscar? His wife's Croatian. He speaks Croatian. - He does? - Yes. I don't care. I'm gonna send you. I trust you. Howard, that's tough. That's really tough for me. I don't know if I can leave maddy for over a month. I can't do that. It's an opportunity. College tuition's not getting any cheaper. College? I'm just trying to get through the week. Yeah, well, hey, that's how it happens. Think about it. I don't need to... I should be traveling for work right now. I don't know if I wanna leave her with a friend for that long. And this is just the beginning, travel-wise. Welcome to not knowing the right thing to do. That's a dad specialty. Is swan coming to Minnesota? I don't think we'll be seeing much of swan anymore. Why not? Because swan and I broke up. What? You didn't talk to me about that. I did not, because I don't need your permission. - Call her and say you're still going out. - No. It doesn't work like that. So make it work. Stop. You're pushing it. Why are you acting like you care? You didn't even wanna meet her. Yeah, but now I know her. And we need more people. Other people have more people. - What are you talking about? - It's always just us. Oh, I'm sorry for being your dad. I'm sorry for being around. Is that what you want? It's not even just us all the time. You got Jordan, you got Oscar, you got poker sundays. - Swan's not at poker Sunday. - Because swan does not play poker. I don't care. I like her. And I like my grandmas, and grandpa Mike, and we never see them. "We never see them"? Then where are we going? How come when something good happens, it always gets taken away? I don't have an answer for that. I don't have an answer for anything else you wanna ask me. Don't ask me no more questions. For the rest of the day, for the whole flight, I'm not answering nothing else that you ask me. You hear me? Question time is over. I give you a inch, you take a mile. Carry your bag. - Ugh! - Who are you "ugh" -ing? Hey. Stop stomping, I'll tell you that much. We're going to have so much fun. Your cousins are waiting for you. Wait till you see your room, girl. It is fabulous. Yeah, come on in. That's your art on the wall there. Cool. I like to unpack. Because I don't like things to be all in a jumble in my luggage, and I can't find anything. I lost mommy's necklace. Yeah, your daddy told me. Why don't I buy you another necklace? It won't be the one daddy bought mommy. That's true. That's true. What was she like? Your mom was the best. Because she was strong and smart. You know, you remind me a lot of her. Hey, should we take a little mommy tour around the neighborhood? - Yeah. - Just the two of us. Come on. That's where your mommy's best friend, anastacia, lived. Stacy. There's a creek behind their house, and they used to go off in there, digging up tadpoles. And they would bring all of that smelly mess and mud into my kitchen. And then every Saturday morning, this is where your mom would come and play soccer. Hey. Um... Is Liz's room permanently set up for maddy now? Yes, yes. Is that problematic? I think it's confusing, especially with all she's been through, the accident and everything else. Well, it wasn't exactly an accident. What is that supposed to mean? If you'd followed the rules the school asked you to follow, instead of encouraging her to act out... You don't think that I know that? You don't think I blame myself for what happened? You don't really expect me to argue that, do you? Let it go. Why do I try, man? - We are all trying. - No, we're not. We have nothing in common outside of Liz. - Nothing in common. - We have maddy. Mike, I apologize to you. I'm not staying here. I'm not dealing with you. Oh, please... I think you both sort of have a thing or two in common. What are you doing? We're leaving. We're going over to grandma Anna's. I don't wanna leave. I wanna stay here. Hey, don't start with me, maddy. It's just for a little bit. You never listen to me. Maddy. This was mommy's room, and I wanna stay here. I wanna live here with grammy and grandad. Why can't we both stay here? I don't wanna go back. I don't wanna go to St. Joseph, even if mommy wanted me to wear a uniform. Okay, listen. Mommy would've wanted you to be happy. That's what mommy would've wanted. Come here. J“ what I've learned from the ocean j“ j“ how to dance and rejoice in the motion j“ j“ let the sun have its moment j“ j“ the moon will come j“ How's maddy? Happy. She seems really happy over there. - You know what I was thinking about? - Hmm? That time I asked dad, could I go live with him, because you wouldn't let me do what I wanted to. I certainly remember. He brought you right back here. All across town. He knew. It's probably the least selfish thing he ever did. J“ don't you grow up on me j“ j“ happy birthday, dear Marion j“ j“ happy birthday to you j“ j“ what I've learned from a travelerj“ you count. One, two, three. J“ there '3 no road that can lead to nirvana j“ okay, everybody, who wants cake? J“ but home is love j“ Sweetheart, um... I made a deal with you when... When you were a baby. Always try and do what was best for you. And right now I can't move here. You know, but that shouldn't mean that you can't. You know, grandma Marion and grandpa Mike... They brought up mommy. And mommy was the best. She was just like you. You know, um... You and your mom are the best thing that ever happened to me. And I, uh... I wanna thank you... For taking care of me. I want you to know that I tried. I know that you're happy here. I just wanna do what your mom would've wanted me to do. Two kisses. One from mommy. From me. Hey. This is gonna be fun. It's gonna be so much fun, you know? You get to spend time with grandma and grandpa. - You'll be back? - Yeah. Yes. Of course I'll be back. Dad's just gotta go... Gotta go to work, and take care of some stuff, and I don't... I don't wanna be selfish. I want you to spend time with your family here. All right? It'll be great. This'll be good. Okay? All right, give me a hug. I love you. I love you too. Look, Matt. Um... I know you don't really wanna hear this, but... Honestly, none of us thought... You would've did the job you did. Mm-hm. We thought you didn't have a chance of taking care of this little girl by yourself. Honestly, you did a way betterjob than any of us thought you would do, man. You should be proud of yourself, man. You did that. She ain't die, right? - I mean, I fed her. - Yeah. Put pampers on her, gave her some clothes. Yeah, that's a good job. I mean, what I did, you gotta say, was probably the bare minimum of parenting. That should be enough, right? I think you're being hard on yourself. I didn't mean it like that. No, I'm not being hard on myself. Nobody else thought that I could raise my child. So why did I? What am I doing? What decision am I making, and who's the decision best for? Because I don't know. Cheers. - I'm not cheersing that. - I did it. Matt, come on in. Close the door. Grab a chair. Yes, sir. I got some bad news. Bad news? I'm leaving. I'm leaving the office. I'm moving up that chain. And I've recommended you to take over my job. I figure, now you got more time to focus, you can travel more for work. I think you're ready. This could be yours. Also throwing in... A new salary. It says, "buy dog food." Turn it over. Wow. There's your college tuition. I mean, I don't know what to say. You know what? You deserve it. Thank you. You deserve it. You know, I'm proud of you. I don't know why. I've always felt sort of like a father figure to you. Not a father, but, you know, like an uncle, maybe, or a cousin. Kind of like a big brother. Neighbor? Maybe I felt like a neighbor. - Bigger, older neighbor. - Got you, yeah. - I don't wanna get all sappy. - You don't have to really get into... I'm not. No, no. But I wanna say... I'm very glad I didn't fire you. I'm, um... I'm glad too. You're a good man. Now go kick some ass in Croatia. - Then next month, London. - Okay. I'm gonna see that, I'm gonna raise it. What is that? Don't waste our time. Just fold. - Just fold. - Don't fold. Am I the only one that feel like this? Does it feel weird that maddy's not here? Yeah. Yeah, it does. - We usually play with, you know, cookies. - Yeah. The chips, that's cool too. You know, cash game. But... - Do you have any, uh, cookies? - You want cookies? Is that what you want? - We'll take some cookies. - Cookies would be great. I'm gonna bring the cookies out here. Y'all better eat every damn cookie. - Okay. - You hear me? You better eat every damn cookie. Or else there's gonna be a problem out here. Let it be a cookie left after I bring these cookies out. I mean, all he had to do is say he miss her too. The snacks are okay. Not super international, but they do have Brazil nuts. Dude, thanks so much for taking me on this trip. Seriously. So psyched to be wingman. Yeah, well, my Croatian's a little rusty. Teach me some stuff. Yeah, for sure, okay. Uh... repeat after me: - What does that mean? - It means, "be quiet." "Be quiet." Why would I wanna learn that? I mean, you know... Have you met me? Yeah. - My wife says that all the time. - You know? You know? Look. Look at the duck. Look at the ducky. Look at the ducky. Look at the duck. Look at the ducks. Oh, yeah. You like that duck? Huh? You like that duck? No? Come on, let's see the next one. Oh, what about this duck? You like that duck? No? All right. This one was my favorite. - She said that one was her favorite. - Because it always looks at the sun. Okay, I love you, dad. I'll call you when I get back to the dorm. No, I'm not nervous. Yeah. I can do anything. - Bro. Look. - What? Oh, my goodness. Maddy, hey, hey. Come here. You can do it, maddy. Jordan, Jordan. Come on, maddy. Come on, maddy. - Do you see this? Are you watching this? - I'm watching this. Oh, my gosh. Hey. Jordan. Jordan, she walking. Somebody's cutting onions close to us or something. I don't know. Ready for your first day? This'll be tough. She's never really been around anybody but me. So there's probably gonna be separation issues. But you're a big girl. Give daddy two kisses. One for me, one for mommy. Okay? Maddy. Maddy. - I'll hang out, just to watch a bit. - Sure, no problem. We should head to the gate. Oh, do you wanna talk or sleep, you know, on the flight? I tend to do both, actually. Talk in my sleep. Urn, so... If I do, just kind of nudge me awake or... You could even talk to me. I'm interesting when I'm sleep talking. I believe in you. Thanks, man. I mean, that's really sweet. I believe in you too. Matt? I really believe in you. The gate's actually that way. Matt? Got it. Hey. Hey. Daddy. I didn't know you were coming today. I surprised you. - Oh. Guess what. - What? Look what I found. - You found it. - Yes, I did. I found it and I said, I gotta get on a plane and fly here to give it to you myself in person. Let me see. So let's go home. Don't cry. I'm not gonna cry. Wherever you are, I wanna go there. Wherever you are, I wanna go there too. Give me a hug. I'll see you back here at christmastime, okay? Okay. Come on, maddy. Come on. Come here. I just wanna say thank you, Marion. For... For understanding, you know? I don't understand anything anymore. But I know that she would be so proud of you, Matt. You know, she said you were the one when you showed up with those little grocery store flowers. You had them gripped so tight, you crushed the stems. I did. I did. I was... I was nervous as hell. I remember that day like it was yesterday. It was yesterday. Take care of her. Grammy loves you. And grandpa loves you too. Give me a hug. Put you down, huh? All right. Take care of your papa. Travel safe. - See you later, Mike. - Mm-hm. - Dad? - Hmm? Are there schools near us where you don't wear a uniform? Uh, yes, there are, but I'm thinking about sending you straight to college, so we won't have to worry about that, okay? Hey. Hey. We were in the neighborhood. We figured we'd stop by. No, we weren't. - We were in the neighborhood... - No, we weren't. We weren't. We were not in the area. But I stopped and I got some flowers that say, "sorry for being an idiot." I wanted to come and bring the flowers by here and give them to you. But I didn't want you not to be here, then I leave them on the step, then somebody come by, steal the flowers, and you never get the flowers. You know, there are a lot of flower thieves in this building. - I didn't wanna say nothing, but yeah. - Really astute. Maddy. It's so good to see you. How you been? I have a really loose tooth. - Look. - Ooh. Hey, tooth fairy will visit. So I'll take those. I'm sorry. Can you forgive me? I... need to talk to maddy for a second. - Okay. - All right. I have a very serious question to ask you. What are your favorite flavors of ice cream? Hmm... Strawberry. I like strawberry. Vanilla. Coffee. Hold up. Coffee? Seriously? You actually like coffee ice cream? Huh. You don't like actual coffee, do you? Mm, no, that's gross. Okay, good. Yes, that's gross. If he is giving you coffee, will you text me? Ugh. Baby. All right. Have we left him waiting long enough? Mm. I guess. Girl, I guess too. Come on. Maddy and I are gonna go get some ice cream. You wanna third-wheel? I mean, yes. Yes, I would. - Oh. Ooh. - Is that your ice cream dance? - Are you sure you're okay with this? - I'm okay. I'm not afraid. All right. It's only for the rest of the year, okay? So you don't like it, we gonna find something else. But if you're not afraid, then guess what. I'm not either. Hello, Mr. Logelin. Welcome back, maddy. Interesting choice of outfit today, sir. I'm wearing my uniform, and maddy is wearing pants. You look very nice today, maddy. - And we're changing our dress code. - Thank you. Go to school. Hey, maddy. I love you this much. Hey, hey. I don't know how to do the dance. Good day.
