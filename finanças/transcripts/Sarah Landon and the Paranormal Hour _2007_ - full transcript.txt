YOUNG MEGAN AND SARAH: Lemonade... Crunchy ice. Beat it once, beat it twice. I'm totally into it. I don't think so. It's going to be so nice. I swear I'm not going. For sure not. Come on. SARAH: Hi, Mrs. Shaw. Oh, you remember me. Of course. How could I forget? How are you doing, sweetie? I'm okay. Mrs. Shaw called for you. For me? She wanted to know when you were coming out to Pine Valley to visit her. What? She said you two talked at Megan's memorial. That was like three months ago. Well, she still thinks you're coming. What would I do up there? It'd be totally boring. I don't know, Sarah. You've been out there before. That was 10 years ago. I was seven. We caught frogs. I think you should go. SARAH: My name is Sarah Landon. And this is the story of a recent trip I made to Pine Valley, California. My car, which had never given me trouble before, suddenly started making loud noises just outside Pine Valley. Some people say things happen for a reason. Is it fate I had car trouble that day? Sometimes I wonder. Hello? Hello. (EXCLAIMING) What can I do for ya? There's something wrong with my car. Hey, I'm just kidding. I'm Carlos. Let's take a look. Where you from? San Diego. Visiting? Yeah. My friend's grandma. Who's that? Thelma Shaw. Oh, yeah. 1987 El Camino. Belongs in the junkyard. (CHUCKLING) Nice woman, though. I used to hunt with her husband. It's your water pump. You're going to need a new one. Are they expensive? I'll work with you. Problem is, it's 4:30 on a Friday. Won't be able to get a new one in here until Monday. Do you want a ride to Mrs. Shaw's? Well... It's not a problem. (PHONE BEEPING) (ENGINE REVVING) Matt, I've got a young lady here who's gonna need a ride. All right. The kid that works for me, he'll be here in about ten minutes. Actually, he lives right around the corner from Mrs. Shaw. Did you say Matt? Yeah, Matt Baker. You know him? I played with him when I was little. Ah, he's a great kid. Works for me part time after school. Didn't he have an older brother? Yeah, David. It's a sad story there. What happened? The name Ben Woods ring a bell? No. David and Matt's uncle started up this place. His son, Johnny, was a local baseball hero and the apple of Ben's eye. I tell you Johnny's the best pitcher in the history of Pine Valley. What about Dan Cooper? What? Dan Cooper? Tell me, Hank, when did Dan Cooper ever have a no-hitter? Hey, Dad. Dan Cooper was one heck of a pitcher. Oh, Johnny, he wasn't even in your league. CARLOS: Ben was passionate about Johnny's baseball. But people in town hated his bragging. Let's just say he wasn't the most popular guy around. But there was no disputing the fact that Johnny was a great baseball player. And he was the most humble kid you could ever meet. Johnny's mother died when he was two. But he had an aunt that he adored. Ben's sister. Mary Ann. CARLOS: Ben and Mary Ann hadn't talked for years. Had a big falling out. But Johnny used to go over to Mary Ann's all the time. To play with his little cousins, David and Matt. Ben didn't like the idea. But Johnny didn't care. He loved those boys. High five. Hey! Oh, my God. You and your birthday balloons. You're 21. CARLOS: On Johnny's 21st birthday Mary Ann wanted to take him out for lunch. Oh, no. (BOTH CHUCKLING) CARLOS: August the eleventh, 1994. A day Pine Valley will never forget. They never made it to the restaurant. She swerved to avoid a cat. Hit a pole. CARLOS: Johnny died at the site of the accident. And the next day, Ben showed up at Mary Ann's door. You killed my son! Ben, please, it was an accident. You're gonna pay for this! An eye for an eye, Mary Ann. I don't care if he is my nephew, he dies on his 21st birthday. CARLOS: Poor David. Oh, my God. (CAR HORN HONKS) There's Matt. Thanks. No problem. You probably don't remember this but... I met you before. No, I remember you. Really? Yeah. I'm sorry to hear about Megan. Thanks. (ENGINE STARTING) Here we are. Thanks for the ride. No problem. Matt? Carlos was telling me about... Actually, never mind. What? Oh, nothing. Need help with this? No, I'm fine. Thanks, though. Bye, Matt. Bye... Hey, Sarah. Yeah? Maybe I'll see you tomorrow. Sure. (ENGINE STARTING) Sarah! You're here! I'm so happy to see you. You too. How did you get here? Matt Baker actually. Matt Baker? (LAUGHING) Willow, where are you going? Okay. Thanks, Mom. Love you, too. Bye. Are you going to stay till Monday? Yeah. Oh, that's wonderful. Was that thing there before? No, that's only been up there a couple of years. My husband shot it just before he died. He loved to hunt, you know. Yeah, I heard that. Listen, my extra bedroom has turned into a storage room lately. So I'm going to put you up in the guest house. Where you and Megan used to play, remember? We loved it up there. MRS. SHAW: The only thing is, the darn toilet is out of order. So you're going to have to use the one in the main house. I hope that's okay with you. Of course. I'll give you a key. Okay. Thank you. (GIRLS LAUGHING) Now there's clean sheets on the bed. And fresh towels in the bathroom. If you need anything else, just let me know. Thank you so much. Dinner will be ready in 30 minutes. Okay. (DOOR OPENING) Thanks again for dinner. It was really good. I'm just happy to have someone to cook for. Now tell me about your ride here with Matt. Didn't he grow up to be a nice boy? Yeah, he seems really nice. You know, this is kind of random, but he was actually my first kiss. (LAUGHING) Oh, dear, don't tell me. It was just a peck. We were playing a kids' game. I don't think he remembered, though. Oh, probably not. Mrs. Shaw? Mmm-hmm? Carlos was telling me the story about Ben Woods. And how he threatened to kill Matt's brother, David? Do you know about that? Well, what did he tell you? Well, he told me how Johnny died and about the threat. But then we got interrupted. He didn't tell you what happened on the day of Johnny's funeral? The whole town shut down. All the stores were closed. Even the local food market. I've lived here all my life and I've never seen anything like it. Everybody in Pine Valley was at the church. Except Ben. And he wasn't answering his phone. Finally, Carlos drove to his house. And when he got there, he heard opera music pouring out the windows. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Ben! Ben! (LOUD OPERA MUSIC PLAYING) Ben! Ben! What are you doing? Ben! Ben! No, Ben! He died? MRS. SHAW: Heart attack. Wow. It was about six months later that things got really bad for David and Matt's mother. David! David! David! David! DAVID: Mom? David? Mom. Mom. (SCREAMING) What? What? Every one of her nightmares included the same symbols. Two X's, a cross above the word "one" and a human skull. So she went to see Frida the town psychic. Half the people of Pine Valley thought Frida was a fraud. The other half thought she walked on water. These are telepathic dreams you are having. Really, they're psychic attacks is what they are. MARY ANN: From Ben? Yes. The unconscious mind is capable of receiving messages from the dead. Ben is sending you these dreams from the spirit world. The skull obviously represents death. The cross above the one you've been seeing really isn't a cross at all. It's a plus sign. XX is Roman numeral for 20. 20 plus one. Oh, my God. Have you ever heard of the paranormal hour? No. Midnight to 1:00 a.m. Witches call it the witching hour. It's when paranormal activity is at its peak. That's when he would strike. What are you saying? I'm saying, Ben will try to kill David on his 21st birthday. Between midnight and 1:00 a.m. That woman is a fraud! Telepathic dreams? Psychic attacks? All she wants is your money! Well then, how do you explain the skull? And the 20 plus one? They're called nightmares, Mary Ann. Everyone has 'em. You don't understand. Oh, I understand. You're convinced that Ben's gonna come back from the grave to kill David on his 21st birthday? All because some charlatan told you so? MARY ANN: Not so loud. MRS. SHAW: Soon after that, Ted walked out on Mary Ann and the boys. What a jerk. Yes. Yes, he was. And then the unbelievable happened. She saw his ghost? So she claimed. And she continued to see him. (SCREAMING) Return to where you came from. I order you. In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost. Leave me alone! Leave me alone! (SOBBING) They finally had to send Mary Ann away. She was in a psychiatric hospital for a year and a half. It's so sad. But then one day, everything stopped. No more ghosts. No more nightmares. They sent Mary Ann home. But she was never the same. Spent the next 11 years staring out her bedroom window. A lot of people in Pine Valley blamed Frida for Mary Ann's troubles. Then one day, Frida just up and left. Moved up to Redding, California, where she died a few years later. David was never the same after Ben's threat. It really affected him. When his 20th birthday rolled along, he started getting really strange. Hey, check this out. If today's your birthday, this is a very critical year for you. Ignore the skeptics. Scorpio was right. What if Frida was a Scorpio? What? Frida, the psychic. Horoscopes are crap, man. How do you know that? I just do. Okay, David, I have it right here. Frida was born on November the twelfth, 1929. MRS. SHAW: After that, he pretty much became a recluse. He quit school at the community college and moved into an old loft above the barn out there. Sad story. So what happened on his 21st birthday? Oh, that's on Monday. Monday? Yes. This Monday? Yes. So do you think anything's going to happen to him? Oh, heavens no. So Ben's ghost. You think Mary Ann was just imagining all that? Well, of course she was. Well, it's past my bedtime. But what about David's horoscope? And Frida? I was a high school science teacher, dear. I'm afraid astrology and psychics are right up there with ghosts for me. So how do you explain Frida being a Scorpio? Coincidence... Just a coincidence. (DOOR OPENING) (TOILET FLUSHING) (DOOR OPENING) Mrs. Shaw? (SHOUTING) Willow, you scared me. Mrs. Shaw? Mrs. Shaw... Mrs. Shaw? (BOTH GASPING) What's going on? Where am I? Come on. Let me take you inside. I must have been sleepwalking. Don't worry, Mrs. Shaw. It's okay. Mrs. Shaw, did you know Ben Woods very well? Well enough. My husband hunted with him. What was he like? Oh, despicable. I couldn't stand the man. Why? Because he was evil, that's why. The way he treated people. There was no excuse for that. And he knew I didn't care for it. I made it very clear to him. Then why did your husband hunt with him? It's a small town. There's only one taxidermy club. But let me tell you every time that man would come by to pick up my husband, it would turn my stomach. Sarah! Sarah, where are you? I give up now. Sarah! Sarah! Boo! That's the most greatest hiding spot ever! I know! (YOUNG SARAH GIGGLING) Who's out there? Hey. What are you doing? Reading a book. Reading a book? On a Saturday afternoon in Pine Valley? What's wrong with that? Nothing. But you're missing a lot of action. Oh, yeah? Like what? All kinds of stuff. 2:00. Hot apple pie comes out at Major's Diner. Wow. That's huge. MATT: You want to check it out? Yeah, sure. All right. Well, I'll be back in 10 minutes. Okay. Best pie in the whole world, huh? Mark my words, the best pie you'll ever taste. In this town? Yeah. So I heard the story about Ben Woods and your brother. Are you worried at all? My brother's crazy. You know where he lives? Yeah, I heard. He's been up there for almost a year. Lives like a hermit. What does he do up there? Up until a couple of months ago, I had no idea. He insisted I never go up there. But one day he was in with Mom... I said, "Forget it." I was going to see what he's up to. WOMAN ON STEREO: Ken and Alice had never heard of shadow people... And they certainly weren't the type to believe in ghostlike entities. All that, however, was about to change. You see, the people that sold the Reeds their new home had failed to disclose the fact that this charming little fixer upper was not meant to be fixed up. They appeared in front of her, lingered for several seconds, then vanished. Afterward she was left with a horrible feeling of dread. At first, Ken thought Alice had... I was shocked. Every inch of that place was covered with books and tapes and articles. All on weird paranormal stuff. Then I stumbled onto this documentary he was working on. DAVID ON TAPE: Okay, this is the road that my mom and Johnny were traveling down. This is probably where the cat would have been. And over here is the pole that they hit. As you can see, people are always leaving flowers here. What can I say? Johnny was a hometown hero. DAVID: What are you doing in here? What are you doing in here? What is all this? You really want to know? Yeah. I'm trying to figure out what happened to Mom. I'm trying to figure out how Ben is going to try to kill me. I'm trying to save my life! Mom had a nervous breakdown and Ben is dead. He can't kill you. Do you even know what a nervous breakdown is? It just a catchphrase for, "We don't know what the hell is wrong with you." That's what it is. I mean, have you ever thought that maybe Ben has Mom in some kind of psychic hold? What? Do you know what telepathy is? No. It's mind-to-mind communication. Frida said Mom was receiving telepathic dreams from Ben. They're called psychic attacks. And they cause psychic paralysis. What if Ben is somehow holding her in that state? You're nuts. See? That's exactly why I don't talk to you about this kind of stuff. You're just gonna say I'm crazy. Black art? Evil spirits? What am I supposed to think? Do you even know what an evil spirit is? What? It's a spirit that remains earthbound to enact revenge. Some even develop demon-like powers. That means they can possess the living, take over their bodies and then use them to commit murder. This is what you think Ben's going to do to you. No. At first I thought so, but now I think he's reincarnated. I think he's been reborn as another person and that person is going to try to kill me. (LAUGHING) Okay. Yeah, laugh. Go ahead and laugh. You can't be serious. I'm totally serious! Think about it! Mom stopped having nightmares and seeing Ben's ghost two years after he died. Unless he messing with me, there's only one explanation. He reincarnated. As who? There's no way of knowing, but it would have to be a kid. A kid. Ben's only been dead for 13 years. A spirit needs at least two years to review its previous life before it can reincarnate. If Ben reincarnated right after he stopped haunting Mom, that would make him 11 years old. Okay. I get your point! You really believe all this crap. But you know what? I still think it's crap, and I think you're nuts! Fine! Think what you want to think. But it's my life. Yeah, I guess it is. By the way, the sign says stay out! All right, I will! And thanks for all of your support! You're welcome. How do you know David's so wrong about all this stuff? He seems to know a lot about it. Yeah, he's done a lot of research, but come on. Wait till you hear this. A couple of weeks later... BOY: Hello? Hello. Hi. Who are you? I'm Justin. I just moved into the house around the corner. I was wondering if there were any kids here I could play with. How old are you? Eleven. Why did you come here? I told you. I was wondering if there were any kids here I could play... There aren't any kids here. He's just a new kid in town. Yeah. And he just happens to be 11 years old? He just happens to move right around the corner from us? And he knows he was Ben in a previous life? And he's here to kill you? No, it doesn't work that way. We all pick our parents before we are born. He picked his because he knew they'd be living in Pine Valley when I turned 21. Right now, he's scouting me out and he doesn't even know it. He has no idea he wants to kill me. But when my birthday comes his subconscious will trigger him to do it. Whatever. There are no coincidences, Matt. No coincidences. (ROOSTER CROWING) Good morning, Fletcher. (ROOSTER CROWING) * Camptown ladies sing this song, do dah, do dah... * Hey. What are you doing? Swinging. This is private property. Sorry. You need to leave now. Okay. Never come back here, ever! MATT: He actually believes this kid is the reincarnation of Ben Woods. So why doesn't he just leave town Sunday night? Get away from him? MATT: He was going to. (PHONE RINGING) Then a few weeks ago, Yolanda called. Hello. (WOMAN SPEAKING SPANISH ON PHONE) Wrong number. (PHONE RINGING) Hello. Hello... You David? Who is this? Yolanda Lopez. David Baker? David Baker? (SPEAKING SPANISH) I'll give you his cell phone number. Do you have a pen? (SPEAKING SPANISH) Forget it. Hold on. David. Yeah? There's a woman on the phone for you. Who is it? I don't know. Yolanda or something. Hello? YOLANDA: Are you David? David Baker? Yeah, who is this? Me Yolanda Lopez. I speak to, como dice, I hear Frida. Frida? Si, si, si. Frida. Frida's dead. We not talk phone. (SPEAKING SPANISH) I see you manana, in Tijuana. Tijuana? Si. Manana. Okay? DAVID: How do you know Frida? (SPEAKING SPANISH) Aunt. Your aunt? And she talks to you? Si. From heaven. What'd she say? Ben Woods try kill you. Oh, my God. She say you should stay home... Birthday... (SPEAKING SPANISH) How say... Twenty-one. Si, si. You stay home birthday... She wants me to stay home on my 21st birthday. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Did she say anything else? She say... God help you. MATT: She's obviously a fraud like her aunt. SARAH: But how do you know that? Trust me. The next thing you know, she'll be asking for money. So you got any big plans tonight? Mrs. Shaw's famous meatloaf. That's about it. Want to see a movie later? Sure. Okay. Pick you up at 7:30? Yeah. Sounds good. Bye. DAVID: This was Ben Woods' place. Back in the 1800s it was a schoolhouse. That's why it's got that bell on the roof. Ben was famous for ringing it every time Johnny's team won a game. MAN 1: Where are you from? MAN 2: Riverside. Relocating? Yeah. We thought we'd check out the country life. Well, you can't beat Pine Valley. WOMAN: Who lived here before? Vera Waters. Very nice woman. DAVID: Okay, I guess this would have been Ben's old room. It looks more like a woman's room now since he left it to his sister-in-law, Vera Waters. What do you think you're doing? I'm just checking out the place. Why? I'm thinking of buying a house. Yeah, sure you are. The sign says open house. Leave me alone. I know who you are. Get the hell out of here! (DOORBELL RINGING) Hi. Hi. Is Mrs. Shaw home? Actually, I think she's sleeping. Oh, okay. SARAH: Can I tell her who stopped by? Sure. I'm Justin. Cat hair. Cat hair everywhere. Justin came by to see you. Oh, probably looking for one of my ginger snap cookies. Do you know him well? No, he's new around here. I saw him riding his bike one day and offered him a ginger snap, told him Saturday was my ginger snap day. He's been back every Saturday since. Do you know where he's from? Iowa. Why'd he move all the way out here? I'm not sure. I haven't met his parents yet. If you want, I can drop some of those ginger snaps off to him. What a splendid idea. I'll send you with a plate of them. Oh, how sweet. Justin just went for a bike ride with his dad. But he'll be happy to see these when he gets back. Care for a cup of tea? Sure. (KETTLE WHISTLING) So where you from, Sarah? SARAH: San Diego. Are you related to Mrs. Shaw? SARAH: No, she's just a friend. That's nice. Would you like French Vanilla, Caramel Nut or just plain old Earl Grey? French Vanilla would be great. Thanks. So where are you guys from? Iowa. Wow, what made you guys move all the way out here? Well, just a change of scenery. Does Justin like it? Oh, he loves it. That's good. Kids normally hate to move, you know. Leaving their friends and all that. Oh, that wasn't a problem for Justin. What do you mean? Well, I don't know. He just loves Pine Valley, that's all. Milk and sugar? Are you kidding me? No. Just because she had a book on past lives. But what kid doesn't have a problem leaving his friends? Maybe he didn't have any friends. Maybe he was bullied. I'm telling you, something's weird. (CLANGING) Okay, I'm back at Ben's house. Like I said, it used to be an old schoolhouse. Maybe this was Johnny's room. Let's see what's down here. Just a bathroom. (WHOOSHING) (BELL TOLLING) (OPERA MUSIC PLAYING) (EXCLAIMING) (BELL TOLLING) Where have you been? MATT: At a movie. What's wrong? I need to see you now. Why? Just get here. Fast. Is it Mom? No. Just come. At first, I thought it was him. I thought he was alive. I thought he never died, but then he disappeared, and the bell was ringing and I heard this opera music. Calm down! You didn't see any ghosts. You're losing it, man. How can I calm down? You know what this means? He's gonna try to kill me from the spirit world! He didn't reincarnate! He's not Justin! MATT: I don't know why we're doing this. It's his camera, he should pick it up. Have you ever been in there? No. So you never came over here as a kid? No. I never even met Ben. My mom didn't want us anywhere near him. He wasn't your typical uncle. This place is creepy. Ben and Johnny. Here it is. (DOOR CLOSING) What was that? Somebody's here. Phil. Who's Phil? He's a real estate guy. Sells every house in Pine Valley. So many random things around this place. I know. Sometimes I look at all the stuffed animals, antlers and stuff and I think, who were they, you know. I wonder what it feels like to be hunted. Scary as hell. Seriously. I love this thing. What? Nothing. That thing just makes me laugh. Why? Me and Megan used to play on it. We called it the Teacup Game. You know, like the teacups at Disneyland? What was the Teacup Game? Well, one of us would sit in the chair and the other would twist the chair round and around and then let go. And the person in the chair would go spinning uncontrollably. (LAUGHING) Oh, my gosh. This one time I spun it so much that it was like all the way up to here. And Megan was sitting in it, just screaming out of control. And I let go and that thing spun like I'd never seen it spin before. (LAUGHING) Then the hook broke off the chain and Megan and the chair went flying. They landed all the way over there. Luckily she wasn't hurt though. Megan was a pretty special friend, huh? Yeah. It's weird to be out here without her. I mean, it's weird to be anywhere without her, but... this place? It's like, she's everywhere. You okay? Yeah. See you tomorrow? Sure. Bye, Matt. Good night. So, how does a dead person kill someone? The answer is, any number of ways. Apparitions have been known to cause heart attacks and car accidents. Every year, 700 people die in electrical fires. How many of those are started by evil spirits? (TOILET FLUSHING) (PHONE RINGING) Hey. GIRL ON PHONE: Hey, where were you today? I'm still in Pine Valley. You missed an awesome party. YOUNG MEGAN AND SARAH: Crunchy ice. Beat it once. Beat it twice. Lemonade. Crunchy ice. Beat it once, beat it twice. Lemonade. Get out of here. It's not safe for you. Mrs. Shaw? Can I borrow your car for a little while? Well, of course you can, dear. Where did you want to go? Just for a drive. (BUZZING) Hey, you. You the one who rang my bell? Yeah. Someone told me that Frida used to live here. You know, Frida the psychic? Is that true? Yes, that's true. Did you know her? Oh, yeah. Do you think she was for real? I mean, do you think she really had psychic powers? Ain't no doubt about that. Really? Do you believe in psychics? I'm not sure. She told me something once. She told me my dog was going to die. It died a month later. Perfectly healthy dog. How's Thelma doing? Did Mrs. Shaw tell you about me? No. You're driving her car. (BOTH CHUCKLING) So do you know the story about Ben Woods and David Baker? Pine Valley's dark secret. Dark secret? Trust me... Midnight tonight, no one from this town will be anywhere near that Baker boy. Ben Woods was a scary man. Have you been to the site where Johnny Woods died? No. They say you can still feel Johnny's presence there. Hi. Thanks for bringing the ginger snaps over. I ate like ten of them. Oh, you're welcome. What are you doing? Just riding my bike. See you later. Hi. Hi. You look a little bit young to be buying a house. Yeah, I'm just killing time. I heard a rumor this place is haunted. Is that true? I haven't seen any ghosts. Did the previous owner say anything? Not to me. PHIL: So where are you from? I don't think I've seen you around here before. San Diego. I'm visiting Thelma Shaw. You know her? Thelma? Oh, sure. I've been trying to get her to put her house of hers on the market for years and make some real money, but she won't listen to me. So do you sell many homes in Pine Valley? All of them. You must be a good salesman. The only one. There used to be another guy kicking around here years ago. But there wasn't enough business for the two of us. It's not every day somebody moves to Pine Valley. So you must have sold the Van Camps their home then. Sure did. You know them too? Yeah, I was over there yesterday. That Justin's quite a kid, huh? Yeah, he's a nice boy. There's something off about him, though. I can't put my finger on it. Something's different. Seems like a normal kid to me. I guess it's just me, then. Come to think of it, there was one thing that struck me as odd. Oh, yeah? What was that? Well, he was adamant that they moved to that area of town. He insisted on it. DAVID: Come on in. SARAH: Maybe Justin is Ben. But he can't be. I saw Ben's ghost, remember? He's in the spirit world. That means he hasn't been reborn as another person. Are you sure you saw his ghost? Yeah. Well, I could have been having hallucinations, but I don't think so. Do you know Vera Waters? Sort of. Could you call her? If anyone else has seen his ghost in there, it'd be her. I tried that. She hung up on me. She doesn't want anything to do with our family. Why don't you just show up at her house? She lives up in Julian now. So? I'll go with you. All the way to Julian? Please? (KNOCKING ON DOOR) What do you want? I need to talk to you. About what? Why are you selling your house? That's none of your business. Please. I need to know. Did you see his ghost in there? My life depends on it. I'm sorry. I can't help you. Please! I need to know. I'm as afraid of him as you are! I knew it! I saw him with my own eyes. He's in the spirit world. What are you talking about? She didn't say she saw his ghost. DAVID: She might as well have. Did I miss something? Why didn't she just answer the question? Why is she afraid of him? He's dead! It's because she saw what I saw, that's why. Ben's coming after me from the spirit world. Hey. Can I help you? Yeah, do you guys have a rest room I can use? MAN: Yeah, it's the little white building right here. MATT: Thanks. It's at your own risk, though. SARAH: David? Yeah. You okay? Yeah. What's the difference between a ghost and a spirit? A ghost is a spirit. Just a spirit of a dead person that hasn't crossed over to the afterlife. Stuck between two worlds. Why does that happen? It still thinks it has business to do here. In Ben's case, it's to kill me on my 21st birthday. If a spirit has crossed over to the afterlife, can it still communicate with us? Say, like in a dream? Oh, yeah. But how do we know if it's them or if it's just an ordinary dream? We don't, really. There's no way of knowing for sure. Can I talk to you for a minute? Sure. Why are you so hard on him? David? Yeah. I mean, I know you don't believe in ghosts and reincarnation and all that kind of stuff but, why not just be on his side? You don't understand. I've been dealing with this my whole life. And he hasn't? In six hours he thinks an evil spirit is going to try to kill him. He's been living in fear of this moment since he was a little boy. You don't have to believe it's going to happen to be there for him. But if you are, regardless of what happens he'll always remember you for it. Mom, I'm coming in. I have someone here to see you. Mom? This is Sarah. Hi, Mrs. Baker. Hello. Well, she must like you. She just said hi. It's a big deal. Most days I don't even get that. (BEEPING) YOLANDA ON MACHINE: Hello, David. It's Yolanda. Frida, you know, she has speak to me again. David. DAVID: What? YOLANDA ON MACHINE: Hello, David. It's Yolanda. Frida, you know she has speak to me again. She say tonight... Como dice? Midnight. She say you, Druid ritual, si? You know? Adios. Who's Drew and Rachel? I have no idea. Do you have her phone number? Yeah, on my cell. (YOLANDA SPEAKING SPANISH ON ANSWERING MACHINE) Hi, Yolanda. This is David Baker. I got your message. Who are Drew and Rachel? Please call me back as soon as possible. It's urgent. Not home. Let's check the internet. Maybe they're experts on this stuff. (TYPING) None of this makes any sense. Is there another word we can try? Besides paranormal? How about Drew and Rachel and evil spirits? You're wasting your time. There are no Drew and Rachel experts. If there were, I would have heard of them. I'm out of here. Where are you going? DAVID: To eat my last meal. Let's keep trying. All right. Try Drew and Rachel and black art. You know what's weird to me? What? The way she said Drew and Rachel. It's like she was assuming that he should know who they are. But he's never heard of them. Maybe she was saying something else. YOLANDA ON MACHINE: She say tonight... Como dice? Midnight. She say you, Druid ritual, si? You know? Adios. I don't think she's saying Rachel. I think she's saying ritual. And she's not saying Drew. She's saying Druid. The Druid ritual! What's the Druid ritual? It's a ritual to ward off evil spirits. The Druids, they were priests in ancient Gaul and Britain. They were surrounded by evil. DAVID: A Druid that was thought to be the target of an evil spirit would sit in the center of a circle of scooped up turnips fashioned into skulls and lit with candles to keep the evil spirit at bay. As a second line of defense, should the spirit be so bold as to enter the circle of skulls, the Druid would wear a disguise and attempt to confuse the spirit. But the Druid knew he could not display even the slightest sign of fear. For his disguise would be of little use should the evil spirit detect him trembling under his mask. I'll never be able to pull this off on time. Do you have a mask? An old Halloween mask somewhere, but definitely don't have any turnips, and it's Sunday night and the food market closed at 9:00. I'll call Ron. Fifty turnips and a box of tea candles? It's a long story. Sorry, Matt. I'm not going to open up the store on a Sunday night so you guys can go play some high school prank. It's not a high school prank, I promise. What do you need them for? Ron. Remember that time you needed that muffler? And I sped to Alpine and back for you so you could get up to Tahoe? Did I ask any questions? No. I just did it. How was that ride to Tahoe anyway? Pretty quiet, huh? Matt, sometimes you can be a real pain in the ass. (EXCLAIMS) What do you think? You scared me. Good. We did it. With 22 minutes to spare. Thanks, guys. So now what? You guys need to leave. Why? Because if you stay here, he might try to kill you, too. We're dealing with an evil spirit here. I don't care. I'm staying. No! In the book, the Druid is left to face the spirit all by himself. We need to follow the book. This could be my only chance. Okay. Okay. Do you think he'll try to kill your mom, too? No. She's the last person he wants dead. He wants her to live. What do you think's gonna happen? I have no idea. Maybe he'll take over someone's body. Like Carlos. Carlos? Ben was a hunter, he could use one of his hunting rifles. Okay. You guys better leave. All right. Okay. Sarah, nothing's going to happen. Trust me. The next hour's going to pass right by and David's gonna suddenly realize he's been worrying his whole life over something that could never happen. These are good. Yeah. You know, if David was right and Ben was going to take over someone's body to kill him, the last person he would choose would be Carlos. Why? Carlos was his best friend. He'd be charged with murder. Good point. MATT: If he was going to take over someone's body, you'd think he'd take over the body of somebody he didn't like. (DOOR OPENING) Mrs. Shaw. (DOOR CLOSING) Is that the front door? She sleepwalks. Mrs. Shaw, you're sleepwalking. (IN MAN'S VOICE) I'm not Mrs. Shaw! (GUNSHOT) (SHOTGUN COCKING) (PANTING) (DOG BARKING) Run! (SARAH GASPING) (SHOTGUN COCKING) (WHISPERING) Do you think she's still out there? I don't know. But we've got to go. Justin. Happy birthday. JUSTIN: No! Dad! Don't do it! Dad, please. Johnny? It was an accident. Unbelievable. Where am I? What am I doing here? I need to go home. The reincarnation of Johnny Woods. You guys. You saved my life. No, we didn't. Justin saved your life. Johnny saved your life. No, you don't understand. It would have been too late. The Druid ritual. It delayed Ben just long enough for... David! Matt! Mom? Mom! MATT: I can't believe it. MRS. SHAW: What's going on? Where am I? It's okay, Mrs. Shaw. Was I sleepwalking again? Yeah, you were sleepwalking. So I'm not crazy. Thanks for everything. You're welcome. Drive safe. Okay. Have a happy birthday. I will. I need to thank you, too. For what? It felt really good to be there for him. Can I call you sometime? Sure. SARAH: And that's the story of my trip to Pine Valley. That day, David cleared out the loft and moved back into the house. His mind finally at ease for the first time since he was a little boy. Justin has no recollection of what happened that night. And if we tried to tell him, he wouldn't believe us. As I drove home, I thought about my encounter with the paranormal. Little did I know, it would be just the beginning. * My hands are shaking * I've been driving all night * Into the daylight * My heart is aching * And I'm trying to find what's burning inside * When there's nobody else * I should take cover in myself * But I can't hide in the middle of nowhere * I don't know where I'm going * But I'll know it when I get there * Out on this one way road * It's time to let go of everything I know * My gauge is empty * And my soul weighs a ton from trying to outrun * Everything inside me * I see coming undone one by one * When there's nobody else * I should take cover in myself * But I can't hide in the middle of nowhere * I don't know where I'm going * But I'll know it when I get there * Out on this one way road * It's time to let go of everything I know * I should have said goodbye * But I'm not turning around tonight * I know I should have said goodbye * But I'm not turning around tonight * Tonight * But I can't hide in the middle of nowhere * I don't know where I'm going * But I'll know it when I get there * Out on this one way road * It's time to let go * But I can't hide in the middle of nowhere * I don't know where I'm going * But I'll know it when I get there * Out on this one way road * It's time to let go of everything I know * Of everything I know * You're all I know * You're all I know
