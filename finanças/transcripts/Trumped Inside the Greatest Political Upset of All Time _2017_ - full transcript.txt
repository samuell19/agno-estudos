I'm gonna spend a lot of time in Ohio and I'll bet Mr. Rubio's gonna spend a lot of time in Florida. - That's it. - [Rubio] A voter in Ohio that doesn't want Donald Trump to win Ohio may very well conclude that the best way to stop him in Ohio is to vote for John Kasich, and I respect that. The only one who has a chance to beat Donald Trump in Florida is me. But if you want to stop Donald Trump in Florida, any vote but a vote for me is a vote for Donald Trump. All right, guys.

What did you mean by that? [Trump] Uh, she doesn't have the look. She doesn't have the stamina. [Clinton] This is a man who has called women "pigs," "slobs," and "dogs." One of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest. He called this woman "Miss Piggy," then he called her "Miss Housekeeping" because she was Latina. - Donald, she has a name. - [Trump] Where did you find-- - Her name is Alicia Machado. - Where did you find this? - Where did you find it? - And she has become a U.S. citizen and you can bet... - [Trump] Oh, really? - ...she's going to vote - this November. - [Trump] Okay, good.

So the U.S. intelligence community "is confident that the Russian government directed the recent compromises of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations." - So I-- - Show us the proof. You don't believe it? No, I don't believe it. Why does Donald Trump suck up to Putin so much? Because he favors a period-- Why does he do-- why does he do that? Because he favors a period of détente. If Nixon and Brezhnev can make a deal, then perhaps Trump and Putin can make a deal You-your view is that American voters, when Trump sucks up to Putin, they think, "Yeah, we like that. That's good." I think they like peace over war. So Trump is not only the candidate of the silent majority, the forgotten Americans, the candidate of law and order, but he is also the candidate of peace. So at this moment, it's October 20th... Yes. What needs to happen for Donald Trump to be president? I would concede that, in my belief, Mrs. Clinton is probably slightly ahead. But Trump is Trump.
