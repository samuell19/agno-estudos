Her name is Kyung-jin. Kyung-jin Yeo. Every time I say her name, a weird feeling takes over me. There's surely something about her. There's no man on earth who doesn't dream about getting away with a girl he loves. I had, and, one day, we hit the road together. However, my fate... Well, let me begin with how we first met. Purse snatcher! Help! He's got my purse! Somebody Help me! Oops! Sorry! Stop! Stop right there! - Stop! - I'm not the one! It's him! There! He's right there! I'm not a snatcher! I'm a decent citizen. He's getting away. Look! You got the wrong guy! Shut up! Every criminal says the same thing at first. It's not me, for Christ's sake! I know you have the right to remain silent, but if you do, you're dead meat. Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law. You also have the right to consult a lawyer, but if you're broke, the government will get you one, which, by the way, I don't think will do you much good. Sir, I caught him red-handed. Officer Yeo, aren't you off-duty today? I am, but not when I see a crime going down, sir. Ma'am, this is the guy who took your purse, right? I nailed Him. Look, lady, you know it wasn't me. I heard her screaming, so I went after the guy. Hey, shut up! You sure you didn't screw up this time? - Come on, don't you trust me? - Well... Your ID. It's in the back pocket of my pants. Give me a break! - Occupation? - I'm a teacher. Physics teacher at Sunik Girls High School! I start this coming Monday, though. Stop fucking with me. I might ruin your life just for that, got it? I can give you a good description of what the guy looks like. A blue shirt and black pants. Curly hair, an earring on one ear, small eyes, goatee, Iong nose, rather fair-skinned, and... he was wearing shoes made of suede with gold plants on them. You remember all that? I think you're selling out your partner for your own ass. - I can draw his picture for you. - Shut up! - I know you're an accomplice. - Well... I don't think he is... See? I am not! What are you talking about? I'm a model citizen. Come here! Smile! Sir, They look alike, don't they?? I think they do. Well... What are you talking about? I don't look like him at all. Shut up and sit your ass down over there. He smells like a criminal. What smell! He can surely hear! Draw the snatcher's face. - This... - Let me help you. I've never lied in my whole life. Not even once! They definitely look alike. Well... you're not a bad painter. It's done. - Draw my portrait, too. - No way! No! I just found it here and was going to take it back to that lady. I was right all along. No, I didn't do it! You're under arrest! Let's do it one more time. One... two... three. - Is that him? - Yep, and he's a solo. Well, I'm out of here. Where do you think you're going? The least you could do is say sorry. The word 'Sorry' isn't in my vocabulary. You ever wanna hear me say sorry, you'll have to change you name to Sorry. Then, you'll hear me say sorry, when I call your name. You're so pretty! You're to supervise the under-aged in the red-light district? - That's right. - You're late. They're already gone. - Should I go alone then? - No. Wait a little. Your partner should be here any minute. - Get your hands off! - Shut up! How could a police officer beat up innocent citizens like myself?! Why not? What are you gonna do about it? What are you doing here? You got mugged or something? Hey you! Come and sit here. Many delinquents at your school? I don't know yet, cause I'm new there. They do drugs, too? I said, I don't know. Yummy! Let's eat some. A lot of high school kids do Ecstasy, you know. Fights and computer hacking are big problems, but the worst is those who organize school gangs and take money from other students. We should round them up and give them a lesson they'll never forget. As the old saying goes, "Only the wicked see the wicked." What?! No, nothing. You pay! I just have a 100 dollar. I'll take two. Wait a bit. Hey, boys! Get over here. Did you throw it at me, sister? You boys are high school students, aren't you? Pick it up. What's the fine for that? I'll pay it. You don't wanna make me upset, kid. Pick it up. - No way. - Now! What's wrong with you, sis? Are you PMS-ing? or what? Do yourself a favor and leave us alone okay? Pick it up now! Come on, bitch, let's get it on. Come on, keep your cool. You don't wanna deal with these kids. We'll notify the school, and they'll get what they deserve. You funk. Come here! - Let go of me! - Come on! Let go! You fucking bitch! - Pick it up! - You'll be sorry for this. Pick it up! Dad! A drug deal going down. Drugs? On the left is a dealer. If we follow him, we can nail the whole drug ring. Let's go. No way! We're here to supervise students, not to crack down on drug dealers! They sell drugs to students, too, okay? Let's leave it to the DEA. We'll call the station, okay? Let's get out of here. No, they'll be gone by the time the DEA gets here. Fine. You go after him. There's no way I'm coming with you. Let go of me! I'm not a prisoner! Please! You know what? The more you wiggle, the tighter it gets. - Give me a key! Right now! - I don't have it on me. - I know you do. - Don't grope me, you pervert! Let's go. - Get down! - Don't boss me around! Just get down! Come on up. Now you go down first and get down on the ground for me. What do you think I am, a ladder? Stairs? No, I am a teacher! And this isn't even your district! No peeing in public places, okay? One... Two... Three! - We have to get the boss. - No! Just get out of here! Freeze! God damn it! Who the hell are you? Who the fuck are you? I'm an undercover agent! An undercover agent? What's that? I have no idea! An agent who goes underground and pretends to be a criminal! Who the fuck are you? You ruined my case! We could've nailed them all. I set up the whole thing like a musical, and you had to walk in here and blow it! What you did was like putting feces on a Picasso painting! Come on up! - Uncuff me. - OK. It's gone! It must've slipped out of the pocket. Let me see! Don't you dare touch me! It hurts! Hold my hand. It won't hurt as much. Wow, it doesn't hurt at all. Sorry, I don't have a key, either. There's a huge crackdown going down, and everybody was called out as backup and they took all the handcuffs we have. By the way... You beat up a high school kid on the street, didn't you? Yes, so what? His father is a member of the City Council. He got pissed off. He'll be here any minute. I'd take off now if I were you. I didn't do anything wrong. He's known as a Godfather of nightclubs. He made his money in the red-light district, he's no different from a gangster. So, do yourself a favor and stay out of here until things settle down. You save me time introducing myself to her, sheriff. Did you beat up my son, bitch? Yes. Why? You stay out of it, sheriff! - Sir, let me talk to you for a minute. - Beat it! Who do you think you're, hitting my son, cunt? You're a police officer, so what? How many lives do you have? Keep your eyes down, bitch! You're really gonna get it! What do you think you're doing? Calm down. Let's have a talk. Who the fuck are you? Get out of my face! Tell me. What did my son do wrong? You call yourself a police officer, beating up kids? He was in the red-light district late at night, smoking on the street. So I gave him a lesson. What's wrong with that? I don't even say anything about him smoking. Who do you think you are, bitch? Don't call me bitch, you fucking bastard! What?! Look at this bitch! Should I break her neck or what? Sir, I'll give her a piece of my mind, okay? Please, leave now. Fire her! She does nothing but waste taxpayers' money! Watch your back, bitch! Boys, remember her face. You know what to do when you run into her on the street. - Right? - Yes, sir! Just you and me. What do you say? What a bitch! What makes you think I'd deal with bitches like you? Don't fuck with me, cunt! Scared, chicken shit? You fucking bitch! God damn it! Fuck! I can't take this shit no more. What did you just say, you bastard? Piss off! Yeah, you're a member of the City Council. So what? That doesn't mean you can beat up police officers, you motherfucker! What the fuck are you? Me? I got arrested for countless accounts of murders, arsons, and rapes! You wanna see what hell looks like? I won't mind killing one more before I get the chair! Come on, let's get it on! On your knees! I said, on your knees! Are you gonna stand there and watch? Do something! You brought it on yourself, fucker! On your knees now! All of you! On your knees! I'm sick and tired of this world where the rich get away with whatever they do! I've nothing to lose here! On your knees! Repeat after me! "I'm sorry, officer." "I'm sorry, officer." Louder, fuckface! "I'm sorry, officer"! - "I'll never mess with you again!" - "I'll never mess with you again!" Teach your son some manners, okay? "Teach your son some manners, okay?" Not that, you stupid fuck! I'll count to three. I want you all out of here by then. Otherwise, you're fucking dead! One... Get your ass moving! Sorry, guys. Sorry. Am I a good actor, or what? Put on my jacket. Can't you wash them after I wash up? On the process to complete a principle... Whose lunch box is this? Nobody's? Well, it's must be the teacher's then. There you go. Ladies, let me give you a piece of advice as a police officer. I am Officer Kyung-jin Yeo. Your job is to study. - Right? - Yes, ma'am! So you shouldn't use violence against your fellow students, drink alcohol, or smoke. Hey! How dare you eat while I'm talking up here? If I see any of you loitering around in the red-light district at night, you're dead meat. Understood? And your teacher, Myung-woo Ko, is a very good man. So don't give him a hard time. Oh, one more thing. He's my boy friend. So don't even think about hitting on him. And we slept together. What's wrong with you? Get out of here! What a great poem! Who wrote this? Please, don't tell me you wrote this, cause this is way too good. You know what? I think you wanted a servant, not a boy friend, didn't you? A boyfriend should help his girlfriend out with this kind of stuff. Which floor? The top floor. - Put them on the table. - Okay. You have a twin sister? No, it's a composite picture. You're twins, aren't you? - Which one do you think is me? - One on the right. Wrong! One on the left. - You are twins! Who came out first? - My twin sister. - I don't use black keys. - Why not? How's your sister? Is she a lot like you? Hook me up with your twin sister. No, just joking. She's dead. We looked so much alike that not many people could tell me from her. Our mom sent us to different schools so they wouldn't get confused, you know. She was like a black key, and I was like a white one. But, my sister was very playful, and sometimes we switched roles. She'd ask me to take exams for her, or... She'd make me do things that she didn't like doing. I hated her for that. And it was the day when I was to take a picture for the yearbook. I had a piano competition to go to, so I asked her to take it for me, and... On her way to my school as I asked her to, she got killed in a car accident. It should've been me. She died instead of me. So we don't even have our pictures in our yearbooks. She wanted to be a cop. What do you do when you feel like playing the piano? I do play it, without using black keys. - What were you like in high school? - Me? The only memory I have from my high school days is the school trip I took with both of my arms in casts, cause I had broken them falling off a bike. - That's wild. - I know. Let's get to work. - I'm not late, am l? - Only an hour late. Really? Well, I've got a little something for you. So do l. A book written by Chundeuk! Use his full name. He's over 90 years old now. Really? I thought he was dead. This is S2. We're in the neighborhood. This is S2 reporting in. Collected one of the packages, The other two are on their way to 103 district. Set up the intercept point. - Freeze! - Stay down! - Call for backup! - Watch your back! Collected one of the packages, The other two are on their way to 1 03 district. Send in backup. Yes, it's me. I'm running my ass out, and you're lying on the floor? No, I'm not! This is S2! In 103 district! Run away behind a side street. Send in backup! I gotta go! I'll call you back later! Let's drop her here. We should kill her. She knows what we look like, man. Kill her. - How? - You do it! - What? - I said you do it! I can't. Besides it's your specialty. No, it's not! No! What was that? How the hell did you get stuck there? No! You shouldn't kill her! Why not? God damn it! I'm having such a lousy day! - I'll visit you in prison. - Stop right there! Kyung-jin! Kyung-jin! You son of a bitch! Come out! You have no place to hide... What are you doing here in there? May I help you? Ma'am, I'm here to see Myung-woo Ko. Where is he? Oh, he just left. Didn't you see him on your way in? No... Thanks anyway. Bastard! Where did you get this piece of junk? Mind your language, lady, cause she is mine now. - You bought it? - Sure. - For how much? - You don't wanna know. As soon as the summer break begins, I'm going off-road across the country. - No pavement, only dirt roads! - Really? Take me with you. - I'll take some time off. - You should stay and catch bad guys. Bad guys are everywhere. Do it like me! Feels like flying. I guess I was the wind in my former life. I wish to fly like the wind. When it winds, while I'm gone, think of the wind as me. Then is this wind is you? They are my friends. If I die, I wish to be the wind. Hmmm... the smell of burning wood! - So good, huh? - You bet! Do you know why people use their pinkies when they make promises? Why? Once upon a time, there was a huge kingdom. And the princess was so beautiful. Mirror, Mirror on the wall, who's the most beautiful girl of all on this earth? Of course, it's you, My Lady. Are you telling me the truth? If you're lying, I'll break you! I never lie, My Lady. You're the most beautiful lady on earth. Because she was so beautiful and wise, princes from around the world came to her palace to propose to her. Five handsome princes made it to the final pick. To see who would be the best match for her, she gave them a test. She hid her right hand behind her back and unfolded only one finger, and the princes had to guess which it was. That was a sign that she'd marry him. Soon, they got married and couldn't be any happier. But the Crusade began, and the prince had to go to war. He promised her that he'd come back alive, crossing his pinky with hers. Ten years had passed, but he didn't come back. She didn't even know if he was dead or alive. And, because she was still so beautiful after all those years... Although so many men came to the palace, asking her to remarry them, she believed that her husband would come back and turned them down. But it got to the point where she couldn't turn them down any longer. So, she decided to remarry a suitor who would cross his pinky with hers. Then, one day, a filthy beggar showed up at the palace. The ministers tried to throw him out, but the princess called him in, telling everybody should be given an opportunity. That beggar was the prince. Truth was that the prince got killed on his way back from the battlefield. Ghosts stay here only for 49 days. That was the 49th day since he died. But he had to come back, even as a ghost, to keep the promise that he'd made to his wife. Finally, she found his body. Now, you understand what crossing pinkies means don't you? Sure. Can I ask you something? Do you think you can die after me Iike that princess did? Why should l? Stop putting in firewood. What are you trying to do, burn me to death? The room is too hot. Does it hurt a lot? Your lips are as fat as a cow's asshole. Forget about kissing any girls. After what you did to me, you don't even say sorry? Like I told you before, if you ever wanna hear me say that, change your name to "Sorry." Fine! From now on, my name is Sorry. Now, say my new name! Your name's Myung-woo! I just changed it! - I can't approve it! - Why not? I can change my name! Stop fighting and keep eating! You're hurting my ears! Myung-woo! Myung-woo! Wake up! Myung-woo! Breathe! Breathe! Breathe! You idiot! You can't die on me! Please, I beg you! Please, wake up! Why did you save me? So I wouldn't have to die after you. We went back to our normal lives. I taught, and she kept chasing down bad guys. This is S2. On the way to 'Lake.' Send in backup. Out. The guy is a jail-breaker named Changsoo Shin. Don't move in until backup arrives. Out. Kyung-jin, it's too dangerous. Let's stay out of this one. He's a jail-breaker. I'm not gonna miss this great opportunity to get promoted. - Put your hands up! - Weapon on the table, right now! Drop your weapon, or I'll shoot you! Drop it now! Are you all right? I found something enormous. This is awesome! I'm in hot pursuit of a criminal now. Where are you? I'll help you. No! It's too dangerous! Her voice sounded somewhat different that day. From the sound, I figured out about where she was. She was tougher than I was, and she sometimes acted through thick and thin. That always got me worried. You son of a bitch! That Son of a bitch doesn't know how to behave! Get down! Quit smoking! I got it. Don't they know how to use guns or what? Turn the car around! - It's Changsoo Shin! - What? Stop right there! Stop! We don't want this shit on our hands. Let's get the fuck out of here. This is S2. This is district 1 17! A man's down at the factory behind the 'Evening Star Park'. I need an ambulance ASAP. This is S2. This is district 1 17! A man's down at the factory behind the 'Evening Star Park'. I need an ambulance ASAP. I didn't save you in the river for nothing. You can't die! Come on. Tell me this is a dream. Tell me it's a dream! This is S2. This is district 1 17! A man's down at the factory behind the 'Evening Star Park'. I need an ambulance ASAP! Maybe I was destined to die in that river. No! What do you think you're doing? You can't do this to yourself! Let go! Let go of me! Let me die! I killed him. I should die, too! Hi! This is Myung-woo Ko. I'm either out of battery or in a non-serviced area. Leave your message after the beep. I'll get back to you as soon as possible. Thanks. Beep! I don't think there is any non-serviced area in the country. Get over here now. Get over here right now! No, no. No, I'll come to you, okay? I... Wherever you are, I'll be with you soon. Ma'am! Ma'am! What are you doing there, ma'am? What do you care? And don't call me Ma'am, okay? I hate that. You're trying to kill yourself, aren't you? Jumping off the roof? She said she is not Ma'am. - Ask her for money. - Forget it. It's shameful. Ma'am... no, Sis. We're runaways. Give us some money, - We won't stop you from jumping. - What? What about 50 bucks? Are you out of your mind? Or you can give us your credit cards. If you die, you don't have to pay the bills, right? Beat it. You're pissing me off. - What now? - She is really pissed off. If you got something to tell me, then do it in front of me. Not behind my back! Why don't you give us some money before you kill yourself? If you jump, your head will be crushed, and guts will spill out. - Okay, fine. What about 10 bucks? - Or let us fuck you. Make the most of your body before it becomes useless. - Let us fuck you. - Stay right there. - You're fucking dead! - She's pissed, man. Come right here! - Lets run. - Stop right there! You are fucking dead meat! Catch us if you can! I see your panties! - Yeah, I can see them. They're black! - She's not wearing any. That's why it looks black. You're fucking dead meat! Get your sorry asses back here! "Fuck you before I die"?! I'll beat you to death before I die! We were just hungry. We haven't eaten anything for 3 days now. - I'm telling you the truth! - What do you feel like? - What do you think? - Pizza! Pizza? Look at her. I can't believe it's the same girl who wanted to commit suicide a minute ago. I know! I've starved for 3 days, too! I should eat well now so I would look good as a ghost. What good is it? If you jump off the roof, your head gets crushed and the guts spill out... Hey, I'm eating here! Go get me some more salad. No bread, no cucumber, okay? Hey, you go. I don't want no beans, okay? Why do you make do everything? You go! - Don't eat everything while I'm gone? - Okay. One more pizza, please! This is for you to go home. So, go home, not anywhere else. I'll call you at home to make sure you're there, okay? Okay, thanks. No, she should thank us, cause we saved her life. - Want me to take the money back? - No! Thank you! Go home! - Okay? - Don't kill yourself! I'm really sorry. Is that the way out? Bye! When it winds, while I'm gone, think of the wind as me. If I die, I wish to be the wind. Myung-woo, is that you? Is it? The wind blowing now... is that you? Or is it just the wind? Where are you? Tell me, Myung-woo. Tell me. Myung-woo! You becoming the wind? You becoming the wind? I can't believe that. Today is the day that you leave forever. The 49th day! But I'll see you before you go. I'll! Mr. Park, put the guy from yesterday in jail. Take that desk there... and your Locker is over there... - Where's detective Kim? - I have no idea. - Detective Kim? - Me? No, not you. Youngho! There are so may Kims around here. There he is. Youngho! He's your partner. Keep up the good work! Hello! How do you do, sir? Who the fuck are you? Get lost! I'm warning you. Don't come any closer. - Kyung-jin, stop! - I'm warning you. I said, don't come any closer! If you want to do it, then do it right. OK, call me back when he shows up. Not anybody else, but me, got that? He's mine. Don't worry. Changsoo Shin? I've gotta go! Later! - I won't speed from now on. - Not this time. Step on it! Freeze! Freeze! Shoot him! Call for backup and an ambulance! Be careful! Myung-woo... Myung-woo... It's you, isn't it? Kyung-jin, stay with me! Think of something nice. You can't die on me, girl! Keep talking to her. I'm going to cry. Kyung-jin, do you remember that day? You were amazing! You can't die over a bullet! You can't die on me now! I've got confession to make to you! Kyung-jin, stay with me. I've got so many things to tell you. - Got some confession to make. - Keep quite! He said I have to keep talking. Kyung-jin! Check her vital signs! BP at 60. EKG on. Get the Thoracic & cardiovascular surgeons down here now! Breathing has stopped. Get ready for DC.! Intubations. 300 joule! Ready! Shoot! Nothing! No change on EKG! 300 joule! Ready! shoot! EP and BB! 360 joule! Ready! Shoot! Nothing! Nothing on EKG! 360 joule! Ready! Kyung-jin. Your night shift is over. Go home, okay? Okay. Myung-woo! Myung-woo! Myung-woo! Myung-woo! It's you, isn't it? You're alive. Why did you run from me? You're not even a good runner. I could've gotten away if I had more than one lung. How could you fake your death? It didn't cross your mind how much it'd hurt me? I didn't want you to see me like this. What are you talking about? - I love you for who you are! - No, I'm not the same Myung-woo. And you're not... Myung-woo! Myung-woo is dead. Let it go, okay? - He's dead! - No. But you're here! Alive, right in front of my eyes! He's dead! Myung-woo! EKG back! - She has a strong will to live. - What? She wants to live! Check the lung sound again! Get the chest tubes ready! And prepare blood for transfusion! Youngho... I know you like her a lot, and you want her to know that, but you're a married man. I don't think it's a good idea to confess to her how you feel. Oh, you've come to. The operation was successful, and you're recovering fast. Get some more sleep. What date is it today? Today? The last day of October. Myung-woo! Myung-woo! Myung-woo! Myung-woo! Myung-woo! Myung-woo! Myung-woo! Myung-woo! Someone has answered my wish. I... I can see you! I have to go now. I'm so glad I could see you before I leave you for good. No, please, don't go! If you have to go, take me with you! Don't go! No... Your time hasn't ended yet. You have so many days left to live. No! No! Don't feel sad for me. We can meet together again. You can feel it, I'm sure. When we get together later, tell me something funny and happy that you have experienced in this life And when you feel me whisper in the wind, you'll get to meet somebody whose spirit is like mine. Now l... Let me go with my heart full of your love. Myung-woo! Sorry! Don't say that. You know I never changed my name. It's still Myung-woo. I won't be sad any more! I'll think you're always here by my side! Come and see me when you miss me! You can come back as the wind! Did you look for me? I sure did. Someone brought this to Lost & Found, and it has your name on it. To Kyung-jin who saved my life... I'm all yours. How have you been? No more sad tears for me? I'm always with you. I told you once that when you feel me whisper in the wind, you'll get to meet somebody whose spirit is like mine. Can you feel me? I'm with you now. You'll meet him. Today! Who brought this book? He whispered to me in the wind. I could feel him. He was standing right beside me. Let me introduce my girlfriend. She... She went through enormous pain because of me and cried a lot. Her name is Kyung-jin. Kyung-jin Yeo. Every time I say her name, a weird feeling takes over me. There's surely something about her.
