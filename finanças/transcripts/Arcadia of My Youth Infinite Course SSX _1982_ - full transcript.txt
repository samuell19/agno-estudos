(thunder booming) (airplane buzzing) (thunder cracking) - [Phantom Narrating] My name is Phantom F. Harlock. It was when I was flying in a thunderstorm from Port Moresby across New Guinea heading for Rabaul in New Britain. As an ariel explorer my life long cherished dream was to conquer the air throughout the whole world. The only thing that stood in my way were the Owen Stanley Mountains. With its highest peak soaring up to 5,030 meters above sea level the mountain people feared calling it the Witch of the Owen Stanley range. My name is Phantom F. Harlock and this plane I call Arcadia is like my own flesh and blood. My companion to share my fate and my youth in Arcadia. Sharing those precious youthful days. Flying high in the sky. If it ever ceases to fly my life will come to and end. With a full load of fuel the plane was heavy that day. I couldn't gain any altitude and Arcadian's engine gasped desperately. The sound from the gasping cylinders was almost like my aged irregular heartbeat. I and my Arcadia flew through ravines wherever possible. (airplane buzzing) (dramatic music) But the Owen Stanley Mountains just stood there high and rigid and cold, totally dominating Arcadia and me. (tense music) Arcadia and me, we had to face bitter defeat for the first time in our entire life in the sky. While turning back swallowing my pride something made me look back. (echoing laughing) The mountain, the mountain was laughing. With my Arcadia I had been continuously blind believing we could never be defeated. I jettisoned all the fuel only leaving enough for 10 minutes of flight. Lightening the plane I'd staked everything on those last 10 minutes. (dramatic music) My name is Phantom F. Harlock. The plane and I shared every moment of my life. My youth and Arcadia, the life I lived flying in the sky with conviction. There is no regret so long as men do not abandon their dreams their dreams will never vanish. (echoing laughing) (dramatic music) (thunder cracking) (echoing laughing) (dramatic music) (thunder cracking) (echoing laughing) (orchestral music) (glass shattering) (screaming) (glass shattering) (gasping) - [Man] The third clock, impact gun damaged. - [Man] Starboard rear engine room damaged. - [Man] The ship's thrust 80%. - [Man] An enemy's ship approaching. Take phase three combat position. (dramatic music) - [Phantom] The dream is over now. Earth is the only place where Earthmen can live. We must submit to defeat, but have we done our best? Hmm. - [Man] This is Illumidus Earth Occupation Force calling. Follow our instructions and land your ship at base 446. If you resist we will take immediate measures to destroy your ship. Six minutes, 55 seconds before touchdown. Maintain present course and strike your colors. Do not attempt to resist. - [Maya On Radio] Broadcasting on frequency band 6050. With variable micro-frequency. The sun disappeared yesterday, but the sun will rise again today. Continue to have faith in the ever rising sun. - That, that voice is-- - Believe in our future. Everyone living on Earth. Although the ground has been burnt-- - [Phantom] Maya. - [Maya On Radio] Turning everything into ashes. All will revive again. The sky is ever so blue. The sound of the ocean unchanged. This is our own planet, Earth, so long as we keep our dreams. - Oh, listen, that's the underground radio from Earth. - [Maya On Radio] It will never disappear. - That's right, it's the voice of Radio Free Arcadia broadcasting from somewhere on occupied Earth. - [Maya On Radio] Keep a song in your heart for tomorrow. Let us stop crying and stand firmly on the ground for we shall all have a wonderful future. (dramatic music) (clanging) (screaming) (whirring) - Stupid landing. - That stumblebum. No wonder we lost the battle. - [Man] The Solar Federation. (mocking laughing) Some invincible armada. - Move, move. (gasping) - Move. (footsteps rapidly thudding) (suspenseful music) - Captain, isn't your name Harlock? Remember you're surrendering. I'll take your sidearm. A very amateurish landing, but I guess it was inevitable due to the poor condition of the runway. Still, I think your secret purpose was to disable your ship. - That's right. - [Zoll] You are to present yourself to headquarters and that will conclude all of your duties. - Haven't we met before? - During the battle at the Castlemagne Star Cluster you disabled my ship by blowing a hole in the hull. - I see. Now that you've won you must feel great. - It was a very long battle and many times I felt my last hour had come. You were a formidable adversary, especially your ship. - Thank you. And what is your name? - Zoll, of Tokarga. - Torkarga. Planet Torkarga? That lost the war against Illumidus a long time ago? - That's right. (suspenseful music) Report at 10 o'clock. Wait. Didn't you hear me? I told you to report to headquarters. - [Phantom] I still have two hours before 10 o'clock and there's a place I wish to go. - Your families' place? - I have no family. - Remember to report at 10 o'clock. - I will be there. What's wrong, don't you trust my word? - Just be careful walking in the streets. If you get killed and fail to return I'll be responsible. - [Maya On Radio] This is the voice of Free Arcadia. The sun set but it will rise again. There's no future for those who don't believe in the future. The ones who believe have endured. Some day we will meet again and some day join forces to start living our future together. Don't let the fire die down. Keep even the faintest spark with a firm belief in our future. (footsteps rapidly thudding) (guns firing) (screaming) - [Man] Over here. (dramatic music) (thumping) (groaning) (gun firing) (thumping) (yelling) (gun firing) (yelling) (clanging) (dramatic music) - I see no reason not to use a man who won the highest hero medal in combat. - Sir. - Apparently Zoll you thought too highly of the Earth man. (dramatic music) - I am here. What do you want of me? - This is the Illumidus Occupation Forces' supreme commander General Zeda. - And I am Harlock. The captain of the Death Shadow. And there's nothing more to say. - Don't get smart Earth man. (bones cracking) (groaning) - Let go of him Harlock. Reading books is not going to help you win any battles. Books will never help you win against us. - We've gathered a staggering amount of data on you Earthmen since our occupation and according to our computer analysis Earthmen are easily acclimated to a new environment. In other words even though they've been hostile up until today now they're wagging their tails at us. - But the fact is Earthmen are definitely not cowards. - [La Mime] Let me present Prime Minister Triter of the Illumidus Occupation cabinet. - Ah, good evening. - Prime Minister Triter I see you have failed to capture The Rose once again. - Ah well, I assure you that I will arrest and execute her the next time. - My orders are to identify the voice of Free Arcadia at any cost, not to execute anyone. And once we find out there are ways of taking advantage of it. - Oh, this man is-- - The ex-captain of the evacuation ship. - Ah, Harlock, this man is dangerous. (gasping) Well, if you'll excuse me, I have things to do. - A useless individual. - By the way Harlock General Zeda has seen your combat record and is willing to give you work, that is if you want the job. - I decline. - So you are also stubborn, you may leave. - Take your food coupons and get lost. Go anywhere, there is nothing for you to do. You will never have another chance to fly again, understand? La Mime, give him some coupons. - [La Mime] Just a moment please. Your food coupons. Keep your temper and eat while you can. The provisions on Earth are running short. Eat now or you'll starve to death. (jazz music) (chattering) - Hey, this guy has a black collar. Why don't we show him some fun? - Leave him alone, he might be the one who scratched one of our ships in battle. - Scratched our ship? I bet you're right. (laughing) - Hmm? (dramatic music) - [Phantom Thinking] I know how you feel. All we can do now is eat and wait. We've been defeated but we still exist. - Just don't die. (laughing) - [Phantom] And I was feeling sorry for him. (groaning) - Why you dirty yellow rat. Take that and go back to the gutter where you belong. And now you're stealing my food. (groaning) - That'll fix him. (laughing) (groaning) - Well? (groaning) (laughing) (thumping) (chuckling) (grunting) (thumping) - Go get him! (angry shouting) (thudding) (bonking) (groaning) (laughing) (thumping) - Now that things have gone this far, drop dead all of you! (laughing) (thumping) Whoa. (thumping) (laughing) - [Woman] Huh? What are you doing? (sirens blaring) (laughing) - That was fun. My name is Tochiro and I'm leaving now. - So am I. (sirens blaring) (cat scowling) (glass shattering) - What a waste. - But why, why do you go around acting like a beggar? - [Tochiro] You could call it a single handed revolt. - Revolt? - [Tochiro] That's right. - [Phantom] How can you call it a revolt without any weapons? - [Tochiro] If you had a weapon would you revolt? - Weapon? But they're impossible to get. (laughing) - [Tochiro] But there's always a way to get anything. Here. - Why that's-- Sort of old though. But how did you? - Better than nothing. (vehicle screeching) - Someone is coming. (gun firing) - [Zoll] Brought you here because the memory areas of both of your genes were put through analysis simultaneously and we analyzed 3,000 years of your past. - Why'd you do that? - Is this a torture? (yelling) - [Zoll] Listen to me. You both have the same common gene factor. See where those two lines overlap now and then, the place where it sparkles. - [Phantom] What does that mean? - [Zoll] It indicates your memories. Both of you have inherited some identical memory genes going back to your distant ancestors. - Identical? - With me? - Some time ago I happened to obtain some strange data on both of your genes. Both of you show the same memory based on a common experience. Now I am going to revive that memory for you to see. (machine whirring) (dramatic music) (gun firing) - Follow me. We'll land on the autobahn for refueling. (airplanes buzzing) (screaming) (clanging) Well I guess that does it this time. - [Tochiro] Why are you waiting there? Get out of there before it blows up. - This, I've got to... - Ah, a C-12-D. - [Phantom] This gun sight has never failed me. In the Battle of Britain or in Africa. What are you doing? (flames whooshing) (explosion booming) (dramatic music) - It's too bad your plane was destroyed like that. - Ah, I never thought that would happen. - Your landing gear wasn't strong enough. It's not your fault. - Are you Japanese? - Yes. I came on a technical exchange as an optical instrument designer. My name is Tochiro Oyama. - I'm Phantom F. Harlock Junior. - Harlock, then you're the one who wrote this book huh? - My father wrote it. - I see, My Youth in Arcadia. Only real men could understand this book. - Maybe. - [Tochiro] But why are you flying an Iron Cross plane? - I'm just doing it to pay the rent. By the way Tochiro are you a samurai? - [Tochiro] My father's a farmer. The first manned rocket in the world. (explosion booming) - I guess it ran out of fuel. - A lot of things are running out fuel these days. - But my battle's not finished yet. - [Man] We've put all the remaining fuel in that new one. It's the only plane left. (dramatic music) (gasping) - Why did you do that? No wonder this country isn't going to last much longer. - [Phantom] Are you interested in things like that? - That's right. My work is to develop a new precision sight. I was handling it very carefully, but your rough landing on the road caused it to be smashed. - I'm sorry. - This is a stupid war. - I guess we're both feeling frustrated. - If they'd only let me work without all this fighting I could work on a great project with a future in it like going to the moon. - There'll come a time some day when man will be able to go there. (airplanes buzzing) (guns firing) Tochiro what's wrong? Hurry and go. - But there's no place where I can go. - Go to Wiesbaden and then to Switzerland. - The Allies already took Wiesbaden last week and they're between here and the Swiss border right now. But I sure wish I could continue my research in Switzerland. (bomb whistling) (explosion booming) - [Phantom] There's not much room, but get in there. It's not bulletproof so if you get hit don't blame me. - [Tochiro] Don't worry, I'll be alright. (suspenseful music) (gasping) (suspenseful music) - Hang on, here they come. (guns firing) Tochiro, you alright? - [Tochiro] I've got a good view. Here comes a Spitfire on the right. - And here we go. And now. (gun firing) Strange, no rudder. Tochiro are there any broken wires back there? - Everything is fine. - Is it? A strange reaction. Got to get lower. So, I'm the only one left. (dramatic music) Switzerland. 10 more minutes. Tochiro, you want to go back to Japan? - [Tochiro] Of course I do. Harlock, don't you want to go home? - I do. And I want to return to Arcadia, the home of forests and lakes and a beautiful paradise like the one in ancient Greece where my memories of youth go racing through the rich green fields. The home of the pirate knight Harlock family. As the end of the journey approaches all my clansmen yearn to return to our lovely home. We all hear the voice of the spirit of the pirate knight of Arcadia. (engine rumbling) (wind howling) Tochiro, next stop Switzerland. 500 meters. Tochiro Switzerland is just on the other side of that river. Hurry up. Come on out. What's wrong? (suspenseful music) (groaning) Tochiro, your hands. You held the broken wire together with your bare hands. That's why the pedals felt so strange. I'm sorry Tochiro, I didn't know. - But I'm not dead. It's just my hands, they're a little numb. - Wait for a second. - [Man] Hey over here. I found them, over by the wrecked plane. (gun firing) - Somebody's coming. - They're French resistance who penetrated into German territory. Don't worry I'll help you across. (dramatic music) Tochiro take this with you. - Why that's-- - It's the one from the plane. Take it with you. - But this is your-- - I would only give this to someone whom I could really trust. Someone who was truly a friend. Someone I could believe in. - Harlock. - [Phantom] Here. (gun firing) Farewell. - Harlock what are you going to do now? - I'm not the type who would run off like a coward. A pirate must always be ready to answer for what he has done. Tochiro never give up your dream and make the most of your life. (gun firing) (gasping) - Harlock. - I'm glad I could meet you at the end of this stupid war. I wish we'd met in different times. - [Man] He's down in the river. Circle around to the right. - Harlock. Stay alive! Harlock, I'll remember you for the rest of my life. My whole family will never forget you. Our friendship will never never die. Never die. (birds squawking) - [Tochiro] Over a thousand years ago our ancestors had been friends. - But I wonder why Zoll gave the book back to me. - Harlock congratulations. My suspecting you of being in the underground has all been cleared up. - [Zeda] And I am quite pleased. - According to Zoll's report the results of the analysis proved you totally innocent along with your friend here. - I must ask your friend to leave us alone for I wish to talk to Harlock. - Harlock. We must have you pledge your loyalty to Earth once again. - I have always fought for this planet in accordance with the laws and rules of Earth at the time. - Alright, good enough. We have decided to send a volunteer army to the planet Tokarga. - Tokarga? - And I am assigning you the task of transporting the troops. - Why are you sending an army there? Why must Earthmen have to go to Tokarga to fight? - Let me remind you that you have pledged your loyalty to Earth and so have I. And now we are being forced into a position where we must either allow the mother to die or kill the stray dog. - So now Earth is the mother and Tokarga is the stray dog. - For Illumidus the entire planet of Tokarga is of no further use. - You intend to annihilate Torkarga, to liquidate it? And who in the universe can decide whether a planet is useless or not? Every single living thing in the universe has a right to life and now the mission to destroy Torkarga has to be carried out by Earthmen using my hands? The whole idea stinks. - Come back. We must cooperate with the Illumidus by sending a volunteer army. It's the only way they'll guarantee the safety of the Earth. You think the whole idea stinks, then tell me if you think it's a better idea to sacrifice the Earth for another planet's safety? (ship rumbling) (wind howling) - [Tochiro] Hmm? - I am Emeraldas, a freelance space trader, and I hold a legitimate license. I am no one's enemy and no one's ally. I'm a free space trader. Who are you? - [Tochiro] My name is Tochiro. - And what do you want? - I'm looking for my friend. But your ship, she's scorched pretty badly. - [Emeraldas] I made an error in crossing the Flame Stream Prominence. It's called the Owen Stanley Witch of Space. Not only is there tremendous heat energy, but super gravitation that pulls in any life reaction. (wind howling) (panting) - [La Mime] Zoll. (gasping) - What's wrong La Mime? It's dangerous to come here. - [La Mime] I know that, but-- - Tell me what's wrong? - [La Mime] I heard the top secret coded order sent to the general commander. - Ah? - Hmm? - [La Mime] It's Torkarga. - What about it? - [La Mime] They're going to... - [Maya On Radio] No matter how great the bitter agony may be consider it as the sigh of the beautiful future yet to come. Do not let despair lure you to defeat. The crisp air at dawn, the fresh wind, remember it all. Remember the time we ran hand and hand over the green, green fields, remember with love, remember. (dramatic music) (panting) (suspenseful music) (guns firing) (yelling) (thumping) (groaning) (gun firing) (yelling) (guns firing) (yelling) (guns firing) - Harlock. - Maya, look out, take cover. Maya. Maya! (guns firing) (yelling) (guns firing) - Harlock! - Maya. Maya. (gun firing) (dramatic music) Maya. (gun firing) (groaning) - Harlock. No. Don't come closer. Your coming this far, it's more than enough to make me happy. Hurry and get away. - How can I leave without you? - Oh no. Don't come any closer. Don't, don't throw your life away. (groaning) Stay alive and someday I know we'll be together again. Harlock, please don't. Don't come any closer. Harlock. (dramatic music) Please don't. (crying) - [Man] Fire! - [Phantom] Maya! (strained breathing) - Harlock, what's wrong? - A little man called Tochiro, have you seen him around here? - [Tochiro] Hey, you finally came. - [Emeraldas] And just where have you been hiding? - [Tochiro] I've been repairing the ship. I still need one part to make it perfect, but even without it she's ready to fly. - [Phantom] You mean you fixed it, it's ready to go? - [Tochiro] Don't you believe me? - It's not that, can she fly? - She sure can. Hey why don't you come aboard and see? (groaning) - Harlock. - Harlock. Harlock, what's wrong? (unsettling music) - [Maya On Radio] This is the voice of Free Arcadia. If you let it burn only ashes will remain, but a true living fire of hope will never die out. Some day like a forest fire it will spread from one to the other increasing its power and that hope will create a new and beautiful future. Even if you set off tomorrow to a distant place no one will think badly of you for people do have faith in you that you will return. (glass cracking) (gasping) (suspenseful music) - [Tochiro] She's been captured. - I can almost picture that poor girl. In her heart she's not only holding the torch for her oppressed people, but she seems to be in love with a particular person. That broadcast we just heard must've been a personal message. She put her life in danger to send that message to someone. - Emeraldas. Would you do me a favor and let me steal your ship? - [Tochiro] What did you say? - Because I must escape from Earth. - [Zoll] I can't let you do that. - You're just as rotten as the rest of them. You've turned yourself into a Illumidus dog. - [La Mime] Harlock, wait a moment. Zoll didn't come here to arrest you. We've come to take over Emeraldas' ship. Our people want to go back to Torkarga. - That's enough La Mime. They've got nothing to do with this. - Oh? - [La Mime] My planet was totally destroyed by Illumidus and reverted to a primitive state. The sight I saw from the refugee ship. I can never forget the grief I felt when our planet lost its glow. And now Zoll and all the other Torkarga people are facing the same tragedy. If Zoll and the others escape Illumidus will retaliate. Still they're driven by their love for their mother planet. If destruction is inevitable they want to perish on Torkarga with their families. They need a ship to return to Torkarga and that's why we've come. (dramatic music) The same thing will happen to Earth some day. For now I beg of you, let Zoll and the others go. - I'm sorry for what I've said. I understand. - [Murigson] All our forces have taken emergency positions. - Hmm, I have been overlooking those underground broadcasts so far thinking it would give the Earthmen a will to work. - Yes, but I thought today's broadcast sounded like a message to start a full scale revolt here on Earth or possibly urging them to escape. - Don't worry they can't go anywhere. They're like rats in a cage making a lot of noise, but they can't escape. - If Tochiro hadn't repaired my ship it would've been abandoned, therefor take it. - [Tochiro] Wait, if you use this ship no matter what she says Emeraldas will lose her free space traders license. Also as soon as Zoll takes off they will immediately commence to attack Torkarga. So we'll use another ship. Harlock, let us go to Torkarga in place of Zoll and the others. I've been waiting a long time, such a long time. Struggling to stay alive, living like a beggar. I've been waiting for this chance. Waiting for the day when I could set out in my own spaceship. - In your own spaceship? - [Tochiro] I've been looking for a captain worthy enough to entrust him with my spaceship. - This spaceship, where is it? (laughing) - I got one, I've got one. (laughing) - Your, you really are incredible. - Zoll, what do you say? With their spaceship and with their help perhaps we could-- - No this is strictly a Torkarga problem. Just let us have the use of the ship. - [Tochiro] No I can't let you do that. The ship is me, every bit of it is me and it won't move without me. - [La Mime] Zoll let me go in your place. Please, and ask Harlock and Tochiro to go to Torkarga. In return you stay here and pretend loyalty to Illumidus and protect the Earthmen. Illumidus is much too strong as an enemy. The only way to ruin them is to take invisible measures like bacteria spoiling it from inside. - You want me to be the bacteria here on Earth? - [La Mime] Yes. - And we'll be the bacteria on Torkarga. - Zoll I will go with them on the ship as a delegate of Torkarga and you take over here. - I've been a dog, a dog begging for the lives of my people, a dog that fights as instrument of Illumidus. The people who remained on Torkarga have been dreaming of a day of deliverance. Believing that we will come back to rescue them some day as they hold their breath under Illumidus's oppression. When I close my eyes I can see my little brother and sister praying and waiting for my return bearing so much bitterness and yet praying for me to come back and save them. (dramatic music) Tochiro hurry to Torkarga. (crying) I am grateful to you for making all this possible. Thank you. (crying) (dramatic music) - Now for the future of Torkarga and to the men of true courage, Zoll of Torkaraga, for Harlock, Tochiro and La Mime and all the rest of you brave men. (speaking in a foreign language) - [La Mime] It's a Torkargan word to toast with true friends. It means we pledge true friendship with our blood. (speaking in a foreign language) (guns firing) (yelling) (guns firing) (wind howling) - Take this to Harlock, please hurry. (coughing) (suspenseful music) (guns firing) (yelling) - Interesting, let's see just how far they can go. - [Man] Maya sent this. She made it especially for you and asked that you use it. - [Tochiro] Harlock we've got to hurry. - Don't worry, we'll protect Maya. Farewell and I wish you a successful trip. - Harlock. (suspenseful music) Down here. (suspenseful music) - Maya, you shouldn't be up. - I haven't got too much longer to live so please let me see Harlock take off. - [Tochiro] And this, the ship I built to fulfill our ancestor's dream and I named her Arcadia. - Arcadia? - Only the name Arcadia would be suitable for a ship that we launch. - Arcadia. - And this is our ship. - Arcadia. Our own ship. And you built this? - That's right. A ship I built with the technology I inherited from my ancestors. It took a long time, but Harlock this is the ship to achieve our dream. (dramatic music) What's that? It's fantastic. Do you want to go and see Maya? - She wouldn't want me to do that. She'd be upset. - But... - With this flag flying from the mast we'll leave. - [Murigson] The rebellious Earthmen are being put under our control but we can't find Harlock anywhere. - Anyway he's like a rat in a trap. (rumbling) What? - Launching angle 40 degrees. Balance normal. Release all circuit seals. Release armament safety circuit. Cylinder exercitation rate 360 million per second. All systems normal. Release thrust conductor valve. Energize artificial gravity. Activate rifle radar. Throttle slow to full speed ahead. (rumbling) - [Phantom] Arcadia, lift off. (tense music) (yelling) (screaming) - Where the devil did that come from? (upbeat rock music) ♪ I'll never be content with sorrow ♪ ♪ Or thoughts of yesterday ♪ ♪ I'll spread my wings to meet tomorrow ♪ ♪ And then we fly away ♪ ♪ Our life's too short to spend it waiting ♪ ♪ For time to take its toll ♪ ♪ Instead I'll spend it celebrating ♪ ♪ The freedom of my soul ♪ (gasping) ♪ To be free without a care ♪ ♪ To live a life no matter where ♪ ♪ To truly see and be aware ♪ ♪ Take on whatever's there ♪ ♪ Though there are times when it's so hard ♪ ♪ To face it alone ♪ ♪ But when the shadows fade away ♪ ♪ I'll be here to see the brand new day ♪ Stop that ship. Stop that ship immediately! (electronic buzzing) - That's the Illumidus Occupation Force radio. (gasping) Emeraldas. - [La Mime] Maya. - By six a.m. Earth time tomorrow if you do not return to Earth and surrender these two female rebels will be publicly executed. - Why the-- - To prevent another uprising from happening again. They will be executed by a firing squad at the crack of dawn. - [Tochiro] No! - [La Mime] We must go back. We can't let them be sacrificed. - An execution will definitely provoke the Earthmen to revolt. That spaceship is not coming back. They've abandoned those two women and that's enough for us to use as propaganda. - Just the opposite. We've got to set an example otherwise the rebels will get more aggressive. - If you cancel the execution I cannot guarantee we'll have full control over the Earthmen anymore. (birds squawking) (wind howling) - Earthmen executing Earthmen? They've turned into Illumidus dogs. (dramatic music) - Are they really going to do it? - After all, the spaceship did not return. (laughing) it seems your friends have abandoned you. - The entire proceedings of this execution are being transmitted to your friends' spaceship. This will be your last chance to plead with them. Ask them to return and save you. - Sorry to disappoint you, but neither of us is going to do that. Harlock and the others wouldn't return anyway. - It bois down to the fact that they are nothing but a bunch of cowards. - You wouldn't know the real meaning of being brave. You're just an ignorant alien who knows nothing about Earthmen. - What? (slap thwacking) (gasping) You may proceed. - Ready. (guns cocking) - Harlock. (suspenseful music) - Fire. (guns firing) (birds squawking) (shouting) - Stop them. - Fire, fire, fire. - Fire! (shouting) (guns firing) Stop them! (guns firing) - They'll pay for this. (guns firing) - [Man] The Earthmen and the Torkarga soldiers revolted and Zoll is leading the men. (guns firing) - Stay back, stay back. (gun firing) (gasping) - Maya. (gun firing) (gasping) (gun firing) (whimpering) - Farewell my friends. Forgive me for not protecting them as I promised. (dramatic music) - [Phantom] Tochiro raise the flag. - [Tochiro] Raise the flag? - [Phantom] Yes. Raise our flag. - [Tochiro] Alright. (orchestral music) - [Phantom] Set Arcadia's course for planet Torkarga. Zoll I'll keep our promise. (orchestral music) - Maya. - Emeraldas please forgive me for thinking only of Harlock. That's the only reason I used the radio, to urge him to escape from this terrible place and my doing it caused the death of Zoll and caused your beautiful face to be scarred for life and so many people have been hurt and captured. All this happened because of my broadcasting. I am the one who should be executed. - That's not true. Even without your radio sooner or later all the people of Earth, even Zoll and me would've done this. I'm sure Harlock, Tochiro and La Mime would also have done the same. - This is Illumidus Fleet Command. All ships will proceed to Earth immediately as reinforcement for Earth occupation troops. - [Zeda] Reinforcements for one man like Harlock? Murigson. - [Murigson] Yes? - I am positive Harlock will return and you'd better start thinking up a plan of how we're going to handle it. - [Murigson] Yes sir. - That's the planet Torkarga. - [La Mime] That's the planet Zoll told me about. It used to be a beautiful planet with rich green forests. (eerie music) - Hmm, my home and now it's been almost completely destroyed. (suspenseful music) That just shows you what Illumidus can do to a planet. The monsters. - [Phantom] It looks like the planet has already been annihilated. But lets go down and have a look. (dramatic music) (thunder booming) (blast booming) - [La Mime] Everything is destroyed. There's not a single life reaction. Torkarga is finished. - Huh? Drones. (guns firing) (explosions booming) (guns firing) (explosions booming) There's an automated defense system. (gun firing) (groaning) (guns firing) (groaning) (dramatic music) They must've fought till the last man. And I don't know where to start looking for Zoll's sister and brother. - Brother Zoll come back to Torkarga, please save us. Brother Zoll come back to Torkarga, please save us. (rumbling) (gun firing) (explosion booming) - Hey. - Hey! (laughing) (cheering) - Why you're still alive. You really are alive. (laughing) I'm so glad. (laughing) Yes I'm so glad to find someone still alive. - Brother Zoll come back to Torkarga, please save us. - [La Mime] What a dreadful thing. They even burnt women and children. - And the Earth will be next. - Please save us. (gun firing) (explosion booming) Brother Zoll come back to Torkarga, please save us. - Brother Zoll. Brother Zoll please help me. (groaning) - [La Mime] Mira. - You've come back. Please help me. - Harlock, hurry and come back. There's a planet demolition bomb right under the tower. (bomb whistling) (explosion booming) - Huh? Take care of Mira. - Harlock do you hear me? We must evacuate at once. What's the matter with them? Why don't they come back? - What is the situation on the surface? - We've got a big problem. A planet demolition bomb is set right at Harlock's position. - A bomb? The Illumidus fleet. - All ships 45 degrees to port and cover all possible escape routes of the enemy spaceship. - [Tochiro] Harlock, La Mime, return at once. - [Phantom] Arcadia lift off. Full speed gravity break away. (dramatic music) (whimpering) (explosion booming) (gasping) - Brother Zoll please save Torkarga, please. (dramatic music) - If we keep on this course we'll collide with the Illumidus fleet. - [Phantom] Can we lose them? - It's possible if we change course but then we'll be forced to go across the deadly Flame Stream Prominence. - The Owen Stanley Witch of Space. - That's right. The five fire streams that go over the double sun, Besberas. The hardest part of space where Emeraldas ship was scorched. - Alright we'll do exactly what my ancestor did. Change course and we'll challenge the Owen Stanley Witch of space. (flames crackling) (dramatic music) (gasping) - Our ship's heat resistance is higher than that of Emeraldas's ship, but she told me that the stream feeds off of life reaction. Thrust decrease 70%. Our defense speed is plus four. We're being pulled into the river of flame. - She's laughing. The witch is laughing at us. (echoing laughing) - Save me please. - [La Mime] It's alright Mira, you'll see Zoll pretty soon. - Big brother Zoll I held out as long as I could. (gasping) (dramatic music) - Now listen to me. The last Torkarga female has just died. Now there is no one left to bear Torkarga children. The Torkarga race is now doomed to extinction. Never forget that Harlock and the others risked their lives to try and give Torkarga a future. - Thrust minus 80%, descent speed plus 10. We're descending too fast. - Tochiro maximum thrust, all engines. (flames crackling) - Come on. (echoing laughing) Hey we've started gaining thrust. (laughing) Harlock we did it. We beat the Owen Stanley Witch of Space. (flames crackling) Oh, Mira. - [La Mime] It's not only Mira who died. - What? (footsteps rapidly thudding) (dramatic music) (gasping) - [La Mime] To cancel out the life reaction which was pulling the ship down. - Everyone of them jumped out into the river of flames? (flames crackling) (dramatic music) (orchestral music) - What, Harlock is coming back? Never. I'll alert the fleet. Intercept that ship. - [Zeda] Hold it. Let him return safely to Earth. - But why? It's only one ship, let's shoot it down. - Yes it's only one ship, but are we going to mobilize our entire fleet to shoot it down? It will only make the Earthmen revolt again. (groaning) - [Murigson] Commander we must intercept it. - They have formally requested permission to land. To send out our force to shoot down a spaceship with people who voluntarily wish to return to this planet where only misery awaits them is something I cannot do. They are very brave people and it's time we showed them a little respect. - Maya Harlock is coming back to the Earth. (gasping) He even made a formal request to Commander Zeda for permission to land here. - He's coming back to Earth and he'll only suffer again. - I knew he would come back. That's the kind of man he is. The next time when his spaceship leaves Earth let's go with him. You've already done more than enough here on Earth. - [Maya On Radio] This is the voice of Free Arcadia broadcasting on a new frequency, variable microwave 8390. 8390. This is the voice of Free Arcadia holding flowers in our hands. Let's proceed to the desert and welcome home our hope for the future with flowers. (dramatic music) - [La Mime] Zoll. - Zoll, I came back as I promised I would, but I came back too late, forgive me. I brought your sister Mira back with us. - Come back to Torkarga, please save us. Brother Zoll come back to Torkarga, please save us. - [Triter] You came all the way back here just to say that to a dead man even though you knew we'd be waiting for you? You're nothing but a stupid fool. - If you don't understand I feel sorry for you. - Maybe what you've done made you feel good, but it puts Earth in a very difficult position. At present Earth has an agreement to maintain cooperative relations with Illumidus even though some idiots are planning a revolt they will soon be suppressed. We want to maintain peace on Earth and a dangerous element like you does not fit in with our present policy and therefore our government orders you to be permanently exiled from Earth. - What's that? - If you insist on remaining here on Earth we will have no other course, but to order our forces to fight you. - You want to fight against us? - You happen to be enemies of Earth. - Enemies of Earth? Alright, if you say we're not welcome here than we shall leave. - But Harlock. - Harlock is right. There's no need for anyone to stay here and lower himself to the level of being a pig. - Emeraldas. Emeraldas. (dramatic music) - The two of you there listen very carefully, the savageness of Murigson who shot Maya and me will long be remembered. And the coward traitor who shot Zoll will never be forgiven. The ruthlessness of you two who think nothing of the life of man shall be avenged. - But I was-- - Don't bother making excuses. You can never justify what you have done. - This is the voice of Free Arcadia. This is Maya. My dear Earthmen I wish to continue to stay on the air and be with you. Oh, I wanted to continue being with you. But now I cannot keep going on. Please forgive me. This is the last voice of Free Arcadia. - Maya. - This is-- - Maya, that's enough. It's alright. - Harlock I had faith in you. I knew in my heart that you would come back again. I knew that you would keep your promise even though your friend Zoll is no longer with us. - We'll go together to the Sea of Stars. - I've been dreaming all these years of a beautiful place. We used to play together and now I will saail in the Arcadia with you over the Sea of Stars. - Maya. - Maya. Maya. Why did you leave me? I had so many things to say. Maya. (dramatic music) - Everyone, Maya who kept appealing to all of you to believe in a better future for Earth is now gone and the government of Earth has just condemned all of us to permanent exile. All of you beware, for the Earth will become a second Torkarga and how will you survive that? I urge all of you all of you to remember the voice of Free Arcadia. - That's enough Tochiro. Since we've been exiled we better leave now. Under that flag is there anyone among you who wants to join us? (dramatic music) Under that flag, do you pledge to fight for those who believe in freedom? - I do. - You can never return. - The Sea of Stars will be our home, our only home. (tense music) - Let's go. - Keep your filthy hands off. He was my best friend. - Hold it Harlock. I am also a proud man and if you wish to depart safely you must first go through me. - A duel? - Yes. And the choice of weapons and the place shall be mine. By custom a duel is fought one to one and I forbid interference. - Very well. - Commander you can't let that man get away now. (grunting) (suspenseful music) - You object to my decision and you raise a weapon in defiance of me and let that be the end of you. (gun firing) - [Maya] Now my loved one sets out with the flag of our freedom. Farewell until the day you come back to me. I believe in you. No matter how far apart we may be I know that you will never forget the Earth. (dramatic music) No one can keep you from leaving with your flag floating high. Farewell my Harlock. You always had faith and hope in tomorrow no matter what the circumstances. And I am proud to have shared my days in the past with you. I pray that your future will be the one you believe in. Farewell my dear Harlock. Live on with hope. Live forever. I see it so clearly deep inside your heart the flame is burning, believing in your future. The fire of the man who will never betray his friends. I love you and I will be apart of the flame in your heart. Deep in you heart I will be with you forever. (dramatic music) - [Emeraldas] Harlock. Look at the red pirate flag on my ship. It's the color of Maya's blood. Maya's white dress dyed like her blood, the flag of a pirate. The red badge of freedom that man is seeking. The flag of my freedom. - Maya was Harlock's-- - That's right the kind of woman who never tired down the one she loved. The kind of woman even you would've fallen in love with. (dramatic music) - Ah? It's signaling follow me. That's the Illumidus flag ship. - Harlock, I've found a true Earthman in you that no computer could fathom and Tochiro came out the same and also Maya. Therefore not as commander of the Earth Occupation Force but as man to man I am determined to have a duel with you. And I hope you will fight without restraint. - [Woman] Contact report. The Illumidus fleet attack force of 624 ships. (gasping) - I think Commander Zeda is trying to pull us away in the opposite direction from the area the Illumidus fleet is approaching. - Increase our thrust. - Roger. We're closing fast on the enemy ship. - Take combat positions. Combat speed five. All turrets combat ready. (orchestral music) Open all reverse jets and accelerate. - [Tochiro] Roger, reduce to combat speed three. - Port side gunner aligned, stand by to fire. Fire at 0.1 garm intervals. 30 micro-garms before volley. - Relative velocity, 128,000. Altitude variance zero. Main gun tracking speed in sync. 10 seconds before discharge. Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. - Fire. - Fire. (guns firing) (yelling) (guns firing) (explosions booming) (yelling) - Port side aft dispatch damage control team. (guns firing) - Give me a damage assessment report. - [Woman] Port launching tube disabled. - [Man] Port exhaust valve damaged. - Number 16 hold and the rear of the airship have been hit. - [Phantom] Hard to port, 180 degrees. - Reduce speed and hard to starboard, 180. (dramatic music) Vertical angle, vector octave. Range six million vols. Synchronize all starboard turrets. (orchestral music) Fire. - Fire. (guns firing) (yelling) (guns firing) (yelling) - [Man] Port side guns disabled. (dramatic music) - Tochiro are you alright? - I'm alright, but see that? The automatic firing sight, it's been destroyed. (suspenseful music) - Transfer all personnel from the side pod hull to the center master control ship at once. I repeat, transfer all personnel from the side pod hull to the center master control ship at once. - You've got the answer? - Yes. A manual sight, it's right in here. - A manual sight. - Look. - Why that's-- - Yes, the original sight your ancestor gave to my ancestor. (dramatic music) - And this, it's what tied our ancestors together, the eye. - Our eye. (dramatic music) - [Phantom] Here he comes. - Roger. Maintain course and speed. - Eject both of the side pod hulls and full combat speed. (gasping) - [La Mime] And Zeda's center control ship hasn't been damaged. - [Phantom] Concentrate fire on the central bridge. - I hope this sight is going to work. - Tochiro open fire. - Roger. (guns firing) (laughing) - That's it Tochiro, give him a broadside. (laughing) (guns firing) (screaming) (explosions booming) - Keep firing. (guns firing) - You alright Tochiro? - I'm still alive I guess, but if they come back and attack us one more time forget it. (explosion booming) (screaming) - All personnel abandon ship. (dramatic music) - [Phantom] Zeda's turning back for another frontal attack. - And I can't guarantee what'll happen this time. He's coming directly at us. - Zeda is a brave man. Years ago there used to be a lot of brave men like him on Earth. - He's going to hit us head on. This is it, here goes. - Tochiro, hold your fire. - Harlock you fought very well. When we meet in hell let's have a drink together. Till then guard your life and keep living and fighting to accomplish that long cherished dream of yours. Now farewell. (gasping) (dramatic music) (explosion booming) (dramatic music) (yelling) - [Phantom] Farewell Zeda, I'll meet you in hell. - Harlock. Commander Zeda led us to a position where we can escape from the Illumidus fleet, but only if we reverse course now and accelerate. - This is our new start on life. I'd hate to be called a coward who turned and ran after his first battle. Tochiro what do you think about it? - Well I don't want to show my back to the enemy. - I can see that anyone who goes against you is in for trouble. - A pirate must live a pirate's life and this is the way of life we have chosen. Action stations. Full speed ahead, prepare for combat. (orchestral music) - He's trying to escape. All ships fly in point, open fire with energy bolts and destroy that pirate ship. (guns firing) - [Man] Captain, all advanced ships report that their energy bolts failed to go straight. Computer side estimation readouts are all wrong. - What? - [Tochiro] Harlock, the magnetic field and dimension wave around us are showing an extraordinary phenomenon. - [Phantom] What's that mean? - It looks normal to the naked eye, but the instruments can't read the exact position of the enemy ships. - The explosion of Zeda's ship must've done it. When his high powered engines blew up they must've warped space over a very large area and I'll bet he did it intentionally just to protect us. Alright, frontal attack. We'll board their flagship. (guns firing) - Don't stop, keep on firing. (guns firing) (orchestral music) (gasping) (orchestral music) (gasping) This is no way to fight. - It isn't in the rule book, too bad because this is a pirate's way to fight. (gun firing) (groaning) (yelling) (gun firing) This is a lesson to teach you to sheer off when you see my flag. (air whooshing) (screaming) Both engines, full break away speed. And set a course for the Sea of Stars. (explosions booming) (dramatic music) Whatever the spirit is that governs the universe and space let my friend Zoll and Mira the last Torkarga female return to your bosom. Now let Zoll and Mira rest in peace forever. - Farewell my friends. (dramatic music) - [Phantom] Somewhere at the point where the rings of time come in contact we shall meet again. Goodbye Maya. Till the last moment of my life in the Sea of Stars the memory of you will stay with me. - [Tochiro] Ready Harlock? (dramatic music) - The Sea of Stars, we submit our loved ones into your hands. (dramatic music) We will never surrender to anyone. We will never seek help from others. We will never fight under any other flag and we will fight only for what we believe in. Standing under our own flag we shall continue to fight for as long as we live under this flag of freedom. Our ship of freedom Arcadia, lift off! - Queen Emeraldas lift off.
