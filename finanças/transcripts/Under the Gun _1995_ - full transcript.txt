(MultiCom jingle) (dramatic drums pound) (ominous music) - [Announcer] As we suspected in this championship, it's comin' right down to the wire. How about that shot by Dickson The Loved One and how 'bout this comeback by the Tomahawks? The scores are tied at 3 all, looks like this one's heading into overtime. The Boilermakers must feel like the roof is caving in. Now, Torrence has gotta be frustrated at the moment, the Boilermakers are blowing a 3-1 lead and Dickson's done a tremendous job shutting down Torrence. Alright, here's the last chance before overtime, Dickson brings the puck through satellite, he's at the blue light, (crowd roaring) this looks dangerous-- A steal, (crowd cheering drowns out words) Boy, where did he go? Do it, he's shoots, he scores! (crowd roaring) (ominous music) Is that the shot they wanted? I can't believe my eyes! He's done it again, Torrence, Frank Torrence... - I took the Boilermakers to number one. And kept us there with the help of Harry Hardaway, our new center. When I first saw Harry, I knew he was destined to be one of the greats. And word of Harry's drug problem got out and signaled the end of his career. Rather than betray a buddy, I took the fifth. Lotta good it did me. My own career went down the tubes. My one friend on the force, Lisa Kraus, called the investigation, "Dirty cops looking for easy money." She was right. All I had left was my nightclub, The Boilermaker, after my old team. Hey, there's nothing to running a nightclub. Everyone wants to be nice to you, right? Everyone wants to be your friend. (loudly crashes) (loudly grunts) (loudly thuds) (loudly clatters) (grunting) (loudly grunts) (loudly smacks) (loudly grunting) (loudly smacking) (loudly grunting) But I'm getting ahead of myself. (ominous music) Years had gone by, it was time to get out. But first, I had to do some renovating. Of course, it took longer and cost more than I planned. So, I took out a loan. Hey, how was I supposed to know the finance company was a front for the local mob? Now, Eduardo Carobelli, the head of the family decided I owed him. "As in, start fronting drug deals for me, "or kiss your butt and your club goodbye." Oh, yeah, this is Frank Torrence, I'm confirming two tickets to Mexico City for the 7:30 a.m. flight tomorrow morning. MY accountant found enough cash to buy The Boilermaker, provided renovations were completed. He was to bring in over a million dollars that night. It was supposed to be in and out, no questions, no problems. Plus, I now have $450,000 in cold cash, Carobelli's drug buy money. All I had to do was get through the night and I'd be home free. I dodged a drug by with the Triads as long as possible. But they showed up at the club. Now, I have to blow the deal in order to keep the money. Now, Frank all you gotta do, is stay alive. (shoes softly clattering) (ominous music) (cup clinks) (plastic crinkling) - So, what do you think, Frank, good, huh? - It's alright, it's good. We're expecting great. - We're not selling door to door, Mr. Torrence. Carobelli gave us his word to distribute long term. And he will keep it. (ominous music) (fingers snap) (loudly crashes) (loudly crashes) (grunts) (loudly smacking) (loudly thuds) (grunts) (loudly smacking) (loudly grunting) (loudly thuds) (loudly grunting) (loudly smacks) (screaming) (loudly smacks) (loudly smacks) (groaning) You'll be dead by morning if you don't come up with $450,000. - [Frank] Yeah, yeah, so bill me. (loudly clattering) (gun clicks) - Trouble, Frank? - No, trouble, Harry, they were just leaving. (shoes softly clattering) - I will return, Frank. (door slams) - Frank, is that developer still coming tonight? - Bringing a cool million three. - In cash? - You think I'd take a check? Alright, here's two weeks severance and a bonus. Here, you might as well take these too. - You're really... Gonna do it this time, leaving. - I told you I would. (soft music) Harry? - I uh, I was just thinking how I miss the game. You know, we really didn't realize how good we at it. I made a lot of mistakes, Frank, and, it cost us both our careers. I don't know how you forgave me, you covered for me, man. (soft music) Jesus, what the hell is this? - Heroine, better clean this up, Harry. (shoes softly clattering) (door clatters) (shoes softly clattering) (mirror clatters) (keypad beeping) (phone rings) Torrence. - [Man On Phone] Please tell me that the deal went smoothly. - [Frank] Who's this? - [Man On Phone] Santa Fucking Clause, who do you think it is? - Eduardo. - [Eduardo] Very good, Frank. We'll have to get you on Jeopardy. How are the renovations proceeding? - All fun and games, but we're battling on. - [Eduardo] Very good, very good. Did you get the merchandise? Well? - They never showed. - The Triads never showed? - [Frank] Most likely tomorrow. - Most likely tomorrow? It's been four nights in a row, most likely tomorrow. Now, you listen to me, you little shit. You got an additional $450,000 of ours in your care. If anything happens to it, you know what's going to be most likely tomorrow. - My funeral? - Yeah, well, technically you need a body for a funeral. Maybe, uh, memorial service. But then again, who'd wanna remember ya. (ominous music) (wheels rattling) - Piss off. Fuck! (loudly clattering) Asshole. (softy knocking) (loudly buzzes) Frank? - Yeah? - Says he knows you, Frank. Wants a security job. Let's go. - Get the fuck off me, man! - Hey! You wanna try that on me? - Hey, whatever you want, man. (loudly grunts) - [Frank] (chuckles) You wanna work security for me, you're gonna have to do a lot better than that. (loudly thuds) (loudly grunts) (loudly grunts) (loudly grunts) (grunting and smacking) (loudly grunts) Alright, that'll do it. (loudly grunting) Hey, Harry, enough, enough! Enough. - Take it easy. - You got a lot of heart. - Look, you don't know me exactly, Mr. Torrence, but you did some time with Charles Oakley, right? Years ago. Well, look, I was inside myself. Tom Oakley. - [Frank] It's okay, Harry. (loudly thuds) (soft music) (crickets chirping) (cicadas buzzing) - [Man On Radio] You're listening to the sweet sounds of 70's soul on KL Love Connection. (smooth soft rock music) ♫ Like a fever ♫ I'm burning up inside (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Frank] How's it going? - Great, Frank. Great time of my life. - [Frank] You'll be happy to know we're leaving. - Yeah, so you keep saying. All I see was a club weeks behind in renovations. - No, I mean, we're leaving tomorrow. - [Sandy] We are? - Yes. I finally got Linpow to agree on a price. He's taking over ownership tonight. That's why I've got the crew working around the clock. I've told him to bring the money in cash. He's playing three times what it's worth but the ledger doesn't show that. So, I've made up the difference in other areas. When he finds that out, we need to be long gone. - So, you think everything's going to go according to plan? - Piece of cake. Nothing can stop us. - [Sandy] Do you want me to confirm the tickets? - No, I'll confirm them. You just be here at six sharp. - Frank? - [Frank] Yeah? - Be careful. - Always. (upbeat rock music) (patrons chattering) (upbeat rock music) (saw buzzing) (saw buzzing) ♫ I said her love is my obsession ♫ She is the keeper of the night (upbeat rock music) ♫ My pride is at her mercy - [Frank] Put it away. - Frank, this is all I managed to salvage of the heroine. I don't feel too comfortable walking around with it. Maybe, we should stash it somewhere, like your office? - Put it in the bottom drawer of my desk. - Oh, oh, k-kay. - Hey Harry, do you want me to do that? - No, I, I got it. ♫ Keep on dreaming ♫ Keep on (upbeat rock music) (door clatters) (glass clatters) - Hey, Frank, you asked me to tell you when anyone suspect came in, right? - Yeah. - Check out that motherfucker at 12 o'clock. I've seen him before, Frank. Works for the Triads. - Are you sure? - [Tom] You know, Frank, they don't go around wearing T-shirts advertising the fact. That's what I heard. - Why tonight? I'm gonna go and ask him to leave. (ice clinking) Follow me. (shoes softly clattering) (glass shatters) Shit, he's here! - Who? - The buyer, Linpow. - What do we do? - Change of plan, Tom. Keep an eye on him. (glass clatters) Mr. Linpow, how are you? - Very good, Frank, yourself? - Oh, not too bad. - This is Lau, my new accountant. - Oh, how nice, how you doing, Lau? Oh. (softly chuckles) Well, shall we retire to my office and finish the deal? I noticed you've brought the money. - Oh, yes, yes, $1.3 million. But I think Lau wants to go over the books just one more time before we conclude matters. - The books are in order, we've been through this a million times. - Well, a million and one won't make any difference now, will it? - Well, I wasn't expecting this. See, I need my accountant, tonight's not a good night for me. - We will convene tomorrow night. - No, no, please, take a seat. He won't be long, I'll get him down here. - Very well, Frank. (dramatic music) (phone dialing) - [Answering Machine Voice] You've reach the service of Larry Hotto Accounting. I've flown to LA today and will be back Thursday afternoon. However, I will be routinely checking the messages, so if you need me urgently, leave your name, your number, and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. (phone beeps) - Larry, urgent is a major fucking understatement. I need the B ledger for Linpow tonight. The son of a bitch wants to go over the figures yet again. I think he knows something's up. I need to get a hold of them tonight. Or if you can arrange with one of your colleagues to fill in for you. But you better give him the lowdown on everything. Look, I'm definitely out of here tonight, so call me at the club, or page me, I'm 555-4678, pager, 122. (door clatters) (smooth music) ♫ She is here is her is night ♫ And her hands have the touch ♫ And how her love is much ♫ Of sands passing by ♫ As she is who she is ♫ Who she is, who she is ♫ Who she is, who she is ♫ And exactly how she is who she is is her own biz (smooth music) - That piece of pie is gonna cost you 500 bucks. - 500? - Look, you got her for 45 minutes, okay? - 500 for 45 minutes. - Make that 44, you wanna stand here talking and arguing? You consider yourself extremely lucky, I'm an old fan. (smooth music) (pool cue cracks) (smooth music) (shoes softly clattered) (muffled smooth music) (loudly crashes) - Shit. - [Thug] Listen, we need to talk. - [Frank] Oh, you're back. Hey, be careful, it's kinda slippery in here. (loudly smacks) (dramatic music) What's the matter? (smacking and grunting) You alright? (loudly smacks) (loudly grunts) (loudly clatters) (loudly grunts) (loudly clatters) (loudly grunts) (loudly smacking and grunting) (dramatic music) That's what you call a slap shot. (loudly smacking and grunting) (dramatic music) (loudly crashes) (loudly thuds) (shoes softly clattering) (ominous music) - Mr. Torrence. I hear you owe some friends of mine some money. - Well, you heard wrong. Hey, watch the floor, it's slippery. - Mr. Torrence, if we do not leave here tonight with $500,000, you will be, uh, how do you say? Dead. - That's exactly how you say it alright. Although, you're delivery's a little uninspired. Maybe next time, you can say something along the lines of waxed, or, "Frank, "you'll be taking an unexpected trip south." What's with this Mr. Torrence shit? You guys are so formal, loosen up a bit, my name's Frank. The friendly approach is always the more intimidating one. - Ah, well, I need half a million dollars, Mr. Frank. Or you will be moving west, oh, south, you'll be moving south. - Hey, yeah, not bad, not bad. (pager beeping) Oop, gotta go, gotta call my accountant. (softly chuckling) - I feel that you are not taking me very seriously, Mr. Frank. (dramatic music) (loudly thuds) (grunts) - [Frank] What makes you say that? (dramatic music) (grunting) (smacking and grunting) (dramatic music) (loudly crashes) (loudly thuds) (groans) (loudly grunting) (loudly crashes) (loudly smacks) (loudly smacking and grunting) (dramatic music) (loudly clattering) (dramatic music) (loudly grunting) (bottle crashes) (grunting) (loudly smacks) (loudly thuds) (grunts) (dramatic music) (loudly smacking and grunting) (loudly clattering) (loudly smacking and grunting) (dramatic music) There's one more in a storeroom, throw 'em both out. Fix this light, clean up this mess. - F-Frank? - I don't have time now, Harry. - Frank! (door loudly clattering) - Detective Dexter. What an unexpected displeasure. - Well, Frank, unexpected is the only way to catch slime like you. - Aw, slime's a little harsh, don't you think? - Harsh, but honest. - What can I do for you? - Well, you can make things easy. Tell me where you stashed the heroine you bought for the Carobelli's this month. - Heroine, Carobelli's? That imagination of yours is really running wild these days. - Was it... My imagination that put you behind doors 13 years ago? - No, I believe falsifying evidence is the correct terminology in that case. - Pity on your part is most of it didn't stick. - But just enough time to give you a taste of life behind bars, eh, Frankie? - Aw, look, I've got nothing to hide. I'm clean, that's a fact. - Then you won't mind opening your wall safe, please. - Well, normally, I'd ask for a warrant. But seeing as I've got nothing to hide, you did ask nicely, and you have no life. (mirror clattering) (keypad beeping) - [Dexter] What's this? - It's one of the b-- It's a business ledger. Sold my apartment. - [Dexter] I thought you rented. - Nope. - Frank, whenever we put the squeeze on the Carobellis, they use some poor dumb shmuck as a front man 'til things cool down. Well, a little birdie has told us for the next six months, you are the front man. - Little birdie's got its facts wrong. - That would make this 450 stolen property. I could detain you on suspicion. - Oh, and risk a false arrest charge? I got a better idea, Dexter. Why don't you find the heroine first, then you can arrest me for dealing. And the 450, well, that evidence can simply disappear like it always seems to when you're involved. - What are these? - Travel brochures. You know, they give you details of travel destinations? - Yes, Frank, I know the function they serve. What the hell are you doing with one? - [Frank] Who are you, my mother? (papers crinkling) (ominous music) (drawer rustling) (ominous music) - Well, that informer also suggests you're planning on shafting the the Carobellis. A high telling it'll turn you clicked on this dump tonight, it is tonight you're flying solo? (ominous music) (loudly smacks) - Actually, I think that's enough, now. You're not gonna find anything. - Move your foot and let me be the judge. (ominous music) What's your fucking game, huh? I can get a search warrant issued within one hour. - Well, you go get your search warrant, and you can continue. You can tear the fucking place apart. But right now, I got a club to finish and apart from being a fool with a badge, you're wasting my time. Now get out. - Okay, tough guy. You wanna play it your way, you wanna fuck with me, hm? Beautiful. Beautiful. (ominous music) (door clatters) (ominous music) (keypad beeping) Oh, Frank? Beautiful. - Uh, yes, hello, I'd like to speak with Detective Kruse, please. Oh, I see, can you have Lisa call Frank Torrence? Yeah, she's got the number. Okay, thanks. (phone clatters) - Well, Mr. Torrence? (upbeat music) - How about some champagne to celebrate the deal, Mr. Linpow? I think it's been long overdue. Louise, arrange some bottles of Dom and some glass for this table. - I need to talk to you, Frank. Are you kidding me? There's only a little domestic left 'cause some nutcases destroyed the storeroom. - You're kidding! Pour it in some glasses and bring it out anyway, they'll never know the difference. - Okay. - Would you like me to put this in the safe for you, Mr. Linpow? - What we want is to see your accountant, Mr. Torrence. - [Frank] On his way. - So is Christmas. (phone ringing) - Larry? - [Woman On Phone] Mr. Torrence? - Yes, sorry, who's this? - [Jane] This is Jane from Southeast Airlines. - Yes, Jane? - [Jane] There's been a slight problem that I have to make you aware of, sir. Your flight has been overbooked and I'm afraid at this stage, we cannot confirm seating. - That's a little more than a slight problem, wouldn't you say? Get me another airline, any flight to Mexico. - There was a mistake made, sir. I can get you on standby, sir. - Standby? Your airline lied to me, it fucking lied to me, and you wanna put me on standby? Listen and listen very carefully. If I don't make that flight tonight, I'm dead. So you better pull a fucking rabbit out of the hat! (dial tone clicks) (loudspeaker voices mumbling) (busy signal beeping) Bitch! (phone slams) (keypad beeping) (dial tone ringing) - Southeast Airlines, Jane speaking. - Uh, yes, Jane, this is Frank Torrence. (dial tone clicks) Aw, you fucking bitch! (ominousmusic) (truck rustling) - Frank? He's leaving. - Who's leaving? Mr. Linpow, please. I'll be right with you, my accountant's on his way. - We don't like to be made fools of, Mr. Torrence. - Well, who does, Lau? Please, take a seat, I'll take care of everything. - I'm giving you two hours, Mr. Torrence. - Please, call me Frank. - [Lau] Two more hours, Mr. Torrence. - Check. - [Club Patron] I'm concern about it this. (softly mumbling) (patrons chattering) There's nothing I can do about it, he's playing big bucks, do you understand? Is a very scary thing, I'm concerned, myself-- - Excuse me, can I have a word with you? - You can fuck off. We're leaving, she's got another job, okay? - This is a matter of life and death. Can't we work something out? - Look, don't bullshit a bullshitter, okay? You need her to keep your pigeons from flying away, right? I'm a businessman and you're a businessman, and the price has rose to 4000 in cash, right now. - Let's see if you can understand this. You're gonna leave your girlfriend here, I'm gonna let you walk out of here. You ever try to come back here and you'll never walk again. - Hey, fuck you! (switchblade clicking) (groaning) (switchblade clicking) - I think we both know what I could do if I had to. (lightly smacks) (loudly clattering) - Be careful, be careful! (screams) (bags crinkling) - How 'bout I give you the money? - Let me get this straight, you'll pay me personally? - Yeah, why do you wanna give that little scumbag his percentage for anyway? - It's the way it works, he gets paid to mind me. Speaking of which, where is he? - He's retired for the evening. - Then I must go. - No, look, I'll pay you $2000 for a couple more hours. - 1000 an hour? - Yeah, split it with him later or whatever you do, but I need you to stay. (dial tone hums) (keypad beeping) (softly ringing) - [Jane] Southeast Airlines, Jane speaking. - Frank Torrence here, look, I'm sorry for the misunderstanding before. - Misunderstanding, was it? No, there was no misunderstanding, sir. I understood everything you denigrated me with. - Yes, and I apologize for that and for raising my voice. But this flight is extremely im-- - Mr. Torrence, I have not taken you off standby, although I could have. Now currently, there are still no seats available and if the situation changes, I will contact you immediately. - Thank you very much, I appreciate-- (phone clicks) - Yeah, right. (busy signal beeping) (loudly clattering) - [Lisa] Executive stress? (dial tone humming) - Lisa! How the hell are you? - Better than you, it appears. (soft music) - God, you look great. (soft music) Come on, have a seat. Look, you didn't need to come all the way down here. I had a visit from you know who, he dropped in tonight. - Yeah, that's why I'm here. I have a few answers about you know who. I hear you're selling up. - [Frank] Where'd you hear that? - Word's out on the street. - How would you know about the street? Aren't you still under restricted duties? - No, not anymore. I just got back last week. - You know, I can't believe they're trying to suspend you for trading shots with some psycho intent on killing you and everyone else in a convenient store. - Yeah, well, once you have a blotch on your record, you seem to lose that benefit of the doubt. - I'm the one that put that blotch on your record. I suck everyone into the Frank Torrence vortex. At least, that's what Sandy calls it. - Yeah, well, Dexter's the one who should've gone down for that one instead of you. I tried to prove it. - Yeah, well, in a perfect world, you would've. Unfortunately, you and I were born into this one. - By the way, how is Sandy? - Hanging in there. - She excited about leaving? - [Frank] Oh, I think relieves the word. - So, you are leaving. - I just don't want anyone to know. - You know, Dexter sure as hell knows. He's out to get you. - He's always gunning for me. That's what makes the son of a bitch so predictable. - Yeah, but this time he's gonna do whatever it takes, if you know what I mean. - Set me up? - Do you trust everyone here? - My workers? - [Lisa] Yeah. - Well, I hadn't thought about it. - Story of your life, Frank. I'd like to help you. - Yeah? - Yeah. As long as I know. - Know what? That I'm clean? - If you just tell me straight, Frank, I'll believe you. - Lisa, you know me better than that. - Yeah. You know this side of town's not gonna be the same without Frank Torrence and The Boilermaker. A lot of people are gonna miss you, Frank. And not just the ones gunning for you. (soft music) (ominous music) (patrons chattering) (ominous music) (dramatic music) - Frank? - [Frank] I'll be back, Lisa, I just need some air. (fire softly crackling) (loudly thuds) (loudly grunts) (ominous music) - Frank? Hey! (grunting and smacking) (dramatic music) (loudly screaming) (dramatic music) (loudly thuds) (grunting and smacking) (dramatic music) (ominous music) (loudly grunts) (loudly smacks) (loudly grunting and smacking) (dramatic music) (loudly crashes) (loudly grunting and smacking) (dramatic music) (loudly crashes) (door clatters) (ominous music) (dramatic music) (loudly grunting) (loudly grunting and smacking) (dramatic music) (loudly clattering) (loudly grunting and smacking) (dramatic music) (loudly clattering and grunting) (screaming) (dramatic music) (loudly grunting) (loudly whips) (dramatic music) (loudly grunting) (loudly crashes) (loudly cracks) (dramatic music) (loudly grunting) (dramatic music) (drawer clatters) (drawer clatters) (ominous music) (drawer clatters) (dramatic music) Ha ha! (loudly clangs) (loudly groaning) (dramatic music) (loudly grunting) (loudly smacks) (loudly smacking and grunting) (dramatic music) (loudly thuds) (dramatic music) (flames crackling) (flames swishing) (loudly smacks) (flames swishing) (loudly smacking) You're a crazy nut, you know that? - It's a beautiful night. - Yeah. Got any marshmallows? (bell tolls) (ominous music) - [Tom] Taking a little trip to Mexico, huh, Frank? (ominous music) (softly clattering) (door clatters) (soft music) - [Lisa] So, I can't change your mind? - Yeah, you probably could. That's why I'm not gonna listen. Look, I have to get out, you know I have to get out. (soft music) It's not just what's happening now, it's everything. I'd give anything to be anonymous again. I'm public property, I'm a target. People think they own me, for Christ's sake. - So, you fight back. You stand up to them. I mean, can't you see you're letting them win? And you know I'll be there, Frank. - I know that. You're always there for me. - And I always will. - God, I wish it could be different. But it ain't gonna be. - Will you ever come back? - Oh, I don't know. Yeah, I guess. When things have cooled down. When people have found someone else to harass and I'm long forgotten. - So, I can't change your mind. - Afraid not. - Well, you can't blame me for trying. - Your two hours is up, Mr. Torrence. Where's your accountant? (pager beeping) - "Frank, call Larry urgently," speak of the devil! He's probably stuck in traffic. - At 2:30 in the morning? (dramatic music) (phone ringing) - Larry? - No, it's your wife, Sandy. - [Frank] Sandy, I'm very busy. - Well, excuse me for breathing! - I'm sorry, what's wrong? - If I told you, would you really care? - [Frank] Of course, I would! - Sometimes I wonder. - I've got a lot on my plate tonight, that's all. - [Sandy] So you got problems and you take them out on me. - I'm sorry, I was wrong, okay? - You think that fixes everything? - Apologizing? It's a start. It's up to you if you wanna try and understand the pressure I'm under. - I find it hard sometimes, to be honest with you. - [Frank] Sandy, are you with me or not? - Yeah. - Then nothing else matters. I wanna spend the rest of my life with you. That's why tonight has to work for me. I don't have time to explain myself, but I'm acting this way for us. I have to be out the door at six. I hope you're there with me. (softly sighs) (phone clicks) - [Man On TV] Start blowin' your little horn, for me. - He's stayin' put, trust me. - [Carobelli] I heard different, are you sure? - Of course, I'm sure. I don't think he's planning on shafting you or anyone. - [Carobelli] What about the Triads? - Well, as far as I can tell, the Triads didn't show. Just like you said. - [Carobelli] Tom, your old man crossed me, Eduardo Carobelli, and now he's dead. You want to end up like him? - Look, I'll keep an eye on things. I'll inform you if things change. (phone slams) Fuck you, Eduardo. (ominous music) (smooth upbeat music) - [Frank] Now where is she? - Hey, Frank. - Tom. - This place is gonna look great when it's finished. Are you sure you really wanna sell this place? (woman yelps) - You had the chance to come out, and you didn't! (loudly smacking) (woman whimpering) (loudly thuds) - What are you doing? - [Call Girl] I just came over here to get us a drink and he came out of nowhere. - Get your drink and get back there. - Frickin' whore! (loudly smacking) - How do you like it? How did this rat get back in? - I don't know, he, he must've slipped past me. S-Sorry, Frank. - Great. (loudly clattering) (screams) (loudly clatters) - You're dead, you're fucking dead! That's right, motherfucker, you're dead! - You know, I've been hearing that line for 10 years now. What, do all you scumbags get together and rehearse or something? Fact is, I'm not dead, I'm alive. When one of you kills me, then I'll be dead. (switchblade clinking) (clatters) (loudly smacks) (ominous music) (doors slam) - Huh? (ominous music) (shoes clattering) Let's see how tough you are now, Mr. Has-Been Hockey Player! (snickering) - Guys, wait a minute. I wanna talk to you two. Get over here. - What's goin' on, man? - Get over here! (shoes clattering) What the fuck are you two doing? - [Tom] Aw! - Get him, you walking steroid! - [Tom] I think every person I ever meet is an idiot. - [Harry] Well, well, I-- (smacking and grunting) Frank, the I should clear-- - [Tom] What are you doin'? What sort of credential's he got? (smacking and grunting drowns out chattering) (bottle loudly crashes) (chains clinking) Look, Frank, put me on the door, this guy's useless. (clattering drowns out chattering) (loudly smacks) (loudly grunts) You gonna leave her to handle everything? - You worry about yourself. (loudly smacking and grunting) - [Tom] You don't listen man-- (loudly smacking and grunting) (chattering drowns out words) - Hooray, get the bitch! - [Tom] He helped himself! - [Frank] Hey, listen, listen, wanna get? What, what? - [Tom] What's your problem? You're not listening! - [Frank] You two just start doing your job. - I can't with this cokehead on the door then, no way! (chain loudly clinking) (softly choking) (smacking and grunting) (loudly clattering) - [Frank] Split and leave me alone. - [Tom] Okay, why don't you go-- (loudly smacking and grunting) - [Frank] Now let me handle this! - That broad's in trouble! - Wait here. - Cut out her heart! (loudly smacking and grunting) - [Lisa] What is your problem? (loudly smacking and grunting) (Harry shouting) - [Tom] Concentrate on what's happening! (loudly clatters) What's the matter with you? - [Frank] Duck. (loudly smacks) - [Tom] You can't see what's going on, what are you, blind? - [Harry] Just get off my case, man! - [Tom] You've been stuffing that stuff up your nose, man-- - [Harry] Yeah, that's why. - [Tom] It's going straight to your brain! (loudly crashes) Get your act together! - Fuckin' busy. (screaming) (dramatic music) (grunting and whipping) (loudly cracks) - Get up, you coward! (softly smacking) I should've hired professionals. Yes, you can kick, you can punch. You can duck, you can weave, let's see you block a fuckin' grenade, Big Boy and Wonder Slut! Ergh! (ominous music) - [Tom] Oh, Jesus! (loudly clattering) (ominous music) (screaming) (loudly crashes) (explosion rumbling) (ominous music) What the fuck was that? - [Frank] Thanks, Lisa. - Any time. Just don't die on me, okay? - You alright? - Yeah, thanks, I'm alright. Looks like it's gonna be one of those nights. - Yeah, no shit. - I don't know about you, but I could use some coffee. (muffled soft rock music) - S-sorry, Frank. - Harry, the cops even smell drugs in here tonight, I'm finished. You understand that? - I, I'll, I'll do better. I'll get rid of it. - [Tom's Voice] Oh, yeah, you get rid of it. I know where you get rid of it, Harry, straight up your nose! - [Harry's Voice] Shut up, I, I don't know what you're doing here. I, I don't want you here. Frank, I don't need him here. - [Tom's Voice] Oh, is that right? Well, that's just too bad 'cause I am here. You need all the help you can get, you're a mess! - [Harry's Voice] Everything was fine until you showed up. - [Tom's Voice] Is that a fact? Looks like my timing was perfect, then? Pity yours is up in the Twilight Zone. - [Frank's Voice] Will you two both shut up? - I want that fucking money. (muffled soft rock music) - Really overflowing with confidence, aren't you, Harry? - Just ffff... fuck you! - Oh-oh-oh kay. - Harry, what happened? - Oh, look, we had some trouble outside. I took care of it. How you doin' anyway? Tom Oakley. - [Louise] Harry, you okay? - I'm fine. - [Woman's Voice] (static drowns out name) Hotel? - Ah, yes, Frank Torrence here, I need to speak with Larry Hotto. - [Woman's Voice] Oh, you just missed him, Mr. Torrence. But he did leave a message for you. - Can I have it? - [Woman's Voice] Yes, he said to tell you he'll be back in 30 minutes and he will call you then. (phone slams) - You're all going down. Now, I told you have those ready by today. What, what are you doing? (lightly smacking) What are you doing, huh? Are you listening to me? You eatin', you sleeping, huh? Get it together, I'm not kidding, alright? All you people are gonna get it, we're gonna burn this joint down. Okay? You'll be the first one to go, the first. (ominous music) - [Lisa] Can you tell Frank I had to step out for a while, but I'll be back? (ominous music) (shoes clattering) (light rock music) - Harry, can I have the key I gave you? - What? - The key, the spare key to my office? - That Tommy guy came up and got it, got it about an hour ago. - What? - He said the construction guys needed to have a look at the plans. - Why didn't you come and get me? - He-he said you were busy with someone and, and, had, had, authorized it. (ominous music) - [Lisa] Do you really think tapping Frank's phone is gonna be of any use? - Kruse, what are you doing this side of town? - Helping a friend. - Yeah, well, I think you better get out of here, Detective, now. - Oh, does Dexter have you too? Can't you see he's using you? - Uh, no, I guess we're all just blinded by greed or whatever the charge you're gonna fabricate. - Fabricate? - [DEA Agent] Fabricate. - Well-- - Hey! - We'll just see who's fabricating what. You better hope this is legitimate. (phone beeping) (grunting) (smacking and grunting) (dramatic music) (shoes clattering) I'm taking you all down on this one. (keypad beeping) (softly bangs) (thuds) (ominous music) - [Frank] You borrowed a key to my office, why? - Construction guys needed to have a look at the plans for the main bar. Think I've come in here and stolen something? Is that what this is all about? You calling me a thief, Frank? - You wearing anything? - Anything like what? - [Frank] Like a wire? - Are you nuts, man? - You're not Dexter's inside man? - I'm no one's inside anything! Who the fuck is Dexter? - A cop, stand up. - Aw, Jesus. Take it easy, Frank, I'm no cop, okay? - What about the Carobellis? - What about 'em? - You heard of 'em? - Yeah, I heard of 'em. - Work for 'em? - No, man, I don't work for 'em. - I'm sorry. I'm paranoid, this place is driving me fucking nuts tonight. - Look, Frank, I believe it now, this. I'd go with the flow, and adapt. And besides, it's all fun and games until someone puts out an eye, right? (door loudly clatters) (dramatic music) (ladder clattering) (shoes clattering) - What the fuck do you think you're doing? (shoes clattering) (ominous music) - Frank, what's going on? - Nothing, he's nuts. Let him go, he won't find shit. - What about the drugs? - What drugs? - The quarter ki of heroine you told Harry to stash in the bottom drawer of your desk, remember? (shoes loudly clattering) (dramatic music) - Torrence! (agents shouting) (shoes clattering) (shoes clattering) (dramatic music) (door slams) (shoes clattering) Torrence! Torrence! (loudly knocking) - Where's the rest of it? (loudly clattering) (dramatic music) (loudly clanging) (loudly banging) (dramatic music) (loudly clattering) - [Dexter] Let's do it. - Go, go, go, go. (ominous music) Okay, fire in the hole. (loudly crashes) (dramatic music) (guns clicking) (door creaking) (guns clicking) (softly thuds) (bell chimes) - [Recorded Voice] It's a full blown knockout! - I'm sorry, boys, I didn't hear, were you knocking? - Okay, tough guy, you thought you'd play it smart. But who I am, we'll do this the hard way. I'm gonna turn your place upside down. - Oh, well, turn away. I've even opened the safe for you. Oh, there's $450,000 in there. I trust it'll all be there when I return. Oh, let me get out of your way and you can start. - Hold it. (guns click) You think I'm stupid? - Oh, only slightly. - Hank, frisk every part of him. Twice. - Yes, sir. - Get to work. - Celeste, get me some salt and a glass of water. - [Celeste] What's wrong, Mr. Torrence? - [Man] Maybe it's only a little I heard you. - [Man] No, you didn't. - [Man] Maybe if you said when you'd go get-- - Are you stupid or something? I mean, how many times I gotta keep kicking you out of here? Get out of here, come on. It's the last time I'm gonna tell you, now just beat it. Go on, beat it. (door slams) (door loudly clatters) (grunts) (ominous music) - That's him, okay? (ominous music) Now, remember, I'm paying you good money, so don't fuck up! Hey, hey! (loudly thuds) - Take it easy-- (smacks) (grunts) (ominous music) (loudly clatters) (ominous music) (glasses clanging) - Oh! (loudly smacks) (loudly grunts) (ominous music) (loudly vomits) (softly coughing) (water running) (ominous music) - Shit. Who the fuck are you? - Me? No one special. - Well then get the fuck out. - You treat all your customers like this? - You're obviously upset about something. I don't know what it is and quite frankly, tonight, I don't give a shit. But I'll make you a little deal. I make this shot, we let bygones be bygones, you go your way, I go my way. - If you don't make it? - If I don't make it, I do what I do best. Beat the absolute crap out of you. Oh, guess what, I missed. (loudly crashes) (dramatic music) (screaming) (loudly crashes) (grunts) (loudly smacks) (loudly grunts) (smacking and grunting) (dramatic music) (loudly grunting) (nail gun snapping) (loudly clanging) (smacking and grunting) (dramatic music) (loudly grunts) (loudly smacks) (loudly grunts) (loudly thuds) (loudly clatters) (loudly smacks) (loudly clatters) (loudly crashes) (grunting) (grunts) (loudly thuds) (dramatic music) (smacking and grunting) (dramatic music) (loudly grunting) (dramatic music) (loudly smacks) (loudly grunts) (smacks and grunts) (dramatic music) (loudly grunting) (loudly clattering) (grunting) (electricity hissing) (loudly clatters) (loudly thuds) (loudly thuds) (shoes clattering) (people chattering) (papers rustling) Shit. (phone ringing) What the hell have you done with my phone? (phone ringing) - What's the matter, Frankie? Are we upsetting you? (pager beeping) - "Frank, where are you? "Will you call you back on your office line in 20 minutes, Larry," shit! - Frank? - What? - Tough night, huh? What are they looking for? - Drugs. - Drugs, you're involved in drugs? - Of course not. - So, that's why you're leaving, huh? - I'm not leaving. - I wish that were true. - Louise, I'm married. And at the risk of sounding pitiful, you're young, it's all ahead of you. You can do a lot better than me. - I doubt that. (soft music) (shoes softly clattering) - [Sandy] Enjoying yourself? (loudly thuds) - Sandy, you're early. - You bastard! - Wait a second! (shoes clattering) Look, will you calm down, I wasn't doing anything. - Tell it to the judge. I'm getting a divorce, I don't need this shit! - A divorce for one kiss? - You trying to tell me that you haven't fucked her? - I'm not trying anything, I am telling you I haven't. - Bullshit! - Look, she's young and confused. - Aw, yeah, and I bet you took full advantage of that. After everything I've been for you. - Listen, will you calm down? I don't need this, I have enough to do deal with at the moment. - Yeah, I bet you do. A failed business, a drinking problem, and a marriage on the rocks. - It's the first night I've had a drink in months! - I don't care, I want a divorce. - Just like that, you want a divorce? - It's not just like anything. I haven't seen you in months! You've been out all night, sleeping all day. Drinking, smoking, gambling. - I've never gambled in my life. - [Sandy] Oh, yes you have. You've gambled with me, and with your marriage. And you've come up craps. - Sandy, I run a nightclub. Hence the name and surprise fucking surprise, I work nights. You think this is fun? I hate this goddamn place. Living like a friggin' vampire. You lose your sense of reason, your sense of perspective on everything. And in less than two hours, it'll all be behind us. Two hours. You wanna throw away everything because you saw one harmless kiss. - I don't know what I saw. But it sure as hell wasn't harmless. - Look, you can't even begin to imagine the night I've had. - I wouldn't bet on that. - Sandy, a lot has happened, I admit that. But we just gotta pull it together one last time and we'll make it. (soft music) I need you to stand by me. Will you do that? - Do I have a choice? - Of course you do. Do you have the letters here? - Yeah. - Go and wait for me then, I won't be long. (shoes softly clattering) My lawyer will be in touch about the door. What, Dexter, what's the matter, come up empty? - Maybe and maybe not. - Well, here I am, arrest me if you've got anything. Or did a certain someone forget to do something? - I don't need any cheap tricks to bust you. - Well, at this stage in the night, if you wanna impound that 450 in cash, you need something. - You're a loser, Frank. You'll always be a loser. It's in your blood, ain't nothin' ever gonna change that. (ominous music) (shoes clattering) (ominous music) (ominous music) (papers rustling) (drawers clattering) (gun clicks) - [Harry's Voice] Frank, I just thought-- (radio static) - Hey, hey, we lost sound. (radio static) - Could be interference, wait and see if it comes back online. - You know, this is why I've honestly become numb. It's the short, sharp pain of being stabbed in the back. Which is probably the reason I'm such an easy target these days. Oh, Jesus, Harry. - (stammering) You don't understand any of, of it, Frank. - Understand? Understand what? You swore to me. You fucking swore to me. - Please, don't let 'em p-put me away. - So, once again, it was you or me. - Dexter wants a man behind bars. He wants Frank Torrence. Frank, we went from ch-champion season in my rookie year. It took 15 years suspension. We were from heroes to felons overnight and I can't-- - Because of you, because you look for the fast buck. I covered for you, it cost me a year inside. You've never learned what it takes, Harry. You could've been one of the greats. You just threw it all away. - I got nothin' now. You got this. - What I got is mine. I worked for it! (glass loudly crashes) You should try it sometime, Harry. You planted something, didn't you? - The v-vault, i-it's in the vault. - Open it. - I don't know the c-combina-- - Open it! (loudly thuds) Open it. - (stammering) Honestly, Frank, the s-safe is the way you open one-- - I'm thinking of a seven-numbered sequence with over 5000 possible combinations. You got exactly five seconds. (mirror clatters) (ominous music) (keypad beeping) Amazing, Harry, shoulda bought a lottery ticket today. Now, get the shit. Get the shit! (dramatic music) (ominous music) (softly clicks) (gun fires) What, are you fucking crazy? (dramatic music) (clattering) (gun firing) (loudly smacks) (grunts) You need help, Harry, and I can't give it to you. (ominous music) Take this shit and get out! - Whoa! (loudly thuds) (softly groaning) (ominous music) - [Frank] Harry! (ominous music) - Frank? Do you sink, or... Swim? (ominous music) (door loudly clatters) (groans) (radio static) - Still nothing. (guns clicking) - Let's move. (dramatic music) (door clatters) (screaming and shouting) (shoes loudly clattering) (loudly smacks) (grunts) (ominous music) (loudly smacks) (grunts) (loudly thuds) (dramatic music) (shoes loudly clattering) (door clattering) (guns clicking) (dramatic music) - You dumb brick, I didn't do a thing! Get these cuffs off me, you fuckhead! - [Agent] Get him out of here. I haven't done a thing! Put my wig on, why'd you pull it off? No, you fucker, you put my wig on. Put it on! Put on my fucking wig, put it on! - You weren't involved with the struggle? - Like, I said, I came in here. Saw him standing over Harry, managed to take him out. Goodbye, Dexter. Or should I say, Ciao? You've already demonstrated twice tonight you have a nasty habit of returning uninvited. (loudly thuds) (loudly smacks) (grunts) (thuds) (gun clicks) - You wanna finish it here now, Frank? All you have to do is open that fucking mouth of yours again. - [Radio Voice] 701485 2785... (softly rustling) - Hold it. - [Radio Voice] At 1 Lincoln Ave, David, Young John, (static drowns out words) (door loudly clatters) (shoes clattering) - [Frank] Sandy! - [Sandy] I saw an ambulance. - Go and get the car, take it around the alley and meet me at the side exit. - Five minutes, Frank. - Five, I swear. Sandy, use the side exit. - Frank. - Tom, lock up. - Yeah. (keys clinking) (shoes clattering) - It's all done, Mr. Torrence. - Excellent. - Thanks, Louise, you can go now. - Frank? Take care of yourself. (shoes clattering) (sirens softly howling) (car lock beeps) (shoes clattering) (sirens softly howling) (car door clattering) - [Man On Radio] Smooth sounds of 70s soul, and it's 5 a.m. on KL Love Connection. (dramatic music) (door clattering) (phone ringing) (softly beeps) (phone ringing) - Shit! Thanks, Larry? - [Larry's Voice] Frank, where the hell have you been? Larry, it's Larry, my accountant. - [Larry's Voice] Where the hell have you been? I've been trying to reach you all night. - Larry, I need the books. Linpow's accountant wants to go over them again. - [Larry's Voice] I know, I got your message. I found you an accountant, my new partner. He's on the other line. I've told him everything. He'll go through the books with Linpow. - Okay, can he come to the club now? - [Larry's Voice] Hold on, I'll just switch to the other line and ask him. (door knocking) Hello, Frank? - Yeah? - [Larry's Voice] He says he's already there. - He's where? - [Larry's Voice] At the club, his name is Lau. See you later, Frank. - Okay, Larry, thank you. (ominous music) - You were right, Mr. Linpow, the ledger was a fake. You're gonna sign over the ownership and give us the money in your safe. Now open it. - I don't have a safe. (gun fires) (mirror crashes) (ominous music) Oh, that one. That's empty. - That's not what your accountant says. Apparently, you got the money that belongs to the club. And a little bit extra. Now open it. (ominous music) Now the real ledger. Tell me something, Frank, does someone ever get used to finishing second? Or does it sting a little bit more each time? How does it feel, Frank? - It stings a little more each time. (ominous music) (loudly clatters) Once again, the wheel turns. Come here, you. - Take it easy, Frank. Take it easy, let's talk, alright? Ahh! - Drop the briefcase. - Okay, okay. - And the money. - Oh. - You can go now. Oh, and tell Larry he's fired. You wanna know how it feels? (loudly clicking) Well, whad'ya know, it's empty. (gun clatters) Now get out, you bean counter. I said you can go now. (lightly laughing) (loudly smacks) (loudly grunts) (loudly thuds) (dramatic music) You're an accountant, right? Shit. (ominous music) (smacking and grunting) (dramatic music) (loudly thuds) (grunts) (loudly whipping) (dramatic music) (loudly smacks) (loudly grunts) (loudly whipping) (dramatic music) (smacking and grunting) (dramatic music) (loudly thuds) (loudly whipping) (grunting and clattering) (dramatic music) (loudly smacks) (grunts) (smacking and grunting) (dramatic music) (switchblade clinking) (dramatic music) (papers rustling) (lightly whipping) (thuds) (loudly smacks) (grunts) (loudly thuds) (gun firing) (dramatic music) (gun fires) (groans) (gun fires) (grunts) (door softly clattering) - Oh. - We've been waiting to hear from you. - I told Eduardo on the phone that-- - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we know what you said on the phone, okay? (gun clattering) We don't fucking trust you. (ominous music) (shoes softly clattering) - This his wife? - Let her go, man, she's got nothing to do with it, Carl! - You tellin' me what to do, you fuckin' piece of shit, hm? - Look, Carl, you gotta tell Eduardo you got this Frank guy all wrong. - Get outta here! - You're selling him out, you bastard! (ominous music) - [Sandy] Frank! (ominous music) - If you'd just given us the money when we wanted you to, Frank. (guns clicking) - We want the money, Frank. (ominous music) (shoes loudly clattering) (gun clicks) - If you've got any money, Frank, I think it belongs to us. - Carl? - Hi, Frank, Eduardo heard you're leaving town for a while so he's not very happy about that. - If there's anything I can do. - Well, you can die. (loudly grunts) (gun firing) (groaning) (grunts) (dramatic music) (guns firing) (dramatic music) (screaming) (guns firing) (dramatic music) (gun fires) (grunts) (guns firing) (dramatic music) - Where are you, you friggin' piece of slime, huh? You watch out! You want some of this, come on then! (guns firing) (dramatic music) (groaning) (guns firing) (dramatic music) - Hey, come here! - [Louise] No, no! - I'm comin', Louise! (dramatic music) (guns firing) (screaming) (guns firing) (gun loudly fires) (loudly thuds) (dramatic music) (gun firing) (loudly grunting) (gun clicks) (ominous music) (guns firing) (shoes clattering) Sandy, stop! - Don't fuck with me, Frank. Put your guns down. Put your guns down! - Dexter, Dexter! That's enough, let's get the hell out of here. - I'll kill her, Frank! (gun fires) (loudly grunts) Just like that! (guns clatter) - Frank? (ominous music) - Shoot him. Shoot him! (dramatic music) (gun fires) (grunts) (loudly smacks) (grunts) (loudly smacks) (grunts) (dramatic music) (smacking and grunting) (dramatic music) (softly choking) (dramatic music) - Frank! Frank, stop it!

You believe that? They found Lisa's body. (soft music) Bastard killed her. I don't think we're going anywhere fast. I know you're disappointed. - Maybe it's a blessing in disguise. - Staying? Oh, I doubt it. - Well, we'd be on the run. Now, we can start again. (soft music) - God, I've missed you. - I know. You know, I think that we could really turn this place around. - We? You hate this place. - It's kinda like you, Frank. Sorta has a way of growing on you.
