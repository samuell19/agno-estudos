"I want to reside in your heart." "I want to reside in your heart." "In your dreams, arms, breath, eyes" "I want to reside." "I want to reside in your heart." "I want to reside in your heart." "I want to reside in your dreams, arms, breath and eyes." "I want to say something.." "I want to reside in your heart." "I want to reside in your heart." "I want to reside in your dreams, arms, breath and eyes." "I want to say something.." "I want to say something.." "Should I say it to you or to this breeze?" "Or should I say it to your beautiful hair?" "Should I say it to you or to this breeze?" "Or should I say it to your beautiful hair?" "I am lost and want to stay lost" "in your love." "I want to say something.." "I want to say something." "Who let the dogs out? Who.." "Who.." "Who let the dogs out? Who.." "Who let the dogs out? Who.." Hey, I am feeling very tense. - Why? We need a partner to go to the disco. But all of us are without partners. Don't worry. There'll be many others like us without dancing partners. We can select our dancing partners out of them. Welcome.. Girls, do you want dancing partners? Yes.. - Okay. Come on, boys.. My dear girls, get ready to choose your partners. Come on. Boy number one. Oh, no. Boy number two. Boy number three. - Come on. Very good! Very good.. Okay! Enjoy. Great! This girl hasn't chosen her partner yet! Sweeties, you still haven't found a partner of your choice! We have! Who? - Him! Him? He is Karan. My dearest nephew. Come here, my dear. You've won a lottery! Come on! Daddy, what are you doing here? You idiot! How long will you keep going to discos? What? No, Dad. It's you who goes there. You lazy fellow. It's nine in the morning. Are you planning to get up or not? Useless fellow. You do nothing except eat, drink and play cricket. You must study also. Come on, get out of bed. Good morning, Brother. You've become such a big Computer Engineer in Mumbai. Because of daddy's fear your prayers and worship are still going on! After finishing your prayers, write the letter. See you. Okay, bye.. - Bye! Greetings, Mom. - Finally, you are up! Yes. - Hail Lord Shiva. I'm already ready to go. What's going on in the house? Everyone is chanting Lord Shiva's name. Idiot. Today is 'Shivratri'. You should also apply vermilion on your forehead. Mother, you know I don't like all this. Aren't you scared of your father? Mother, he is your husband. You can be scared, but why should I be? You are not scared, that's why you get a firing every day. Mummy, I'm bored hearing him shouting everyday but how is it that he's not bored of firing me every day! Son, he scolds you for your good. That is because he loves you. He loves me! Has he ever even caressed me lovingly. Son, you change yourself and then see! Mummy, if there is anyone who needs to be changed I would change daddy straight away. What did you say? - What did he say? It's nothing, Daddy. I was telling her that it's 'Shivratri' and why hasn't she put vermilion on my forehead. Good. Very good, dear. Mother, one should genuinely want to pray, and not be forced to do so. What's with the sound coming from uncle's room? Uncle, what's this? You too are praying for fear of daddy! It's not that, my dear. Actually your father is a very good and religious man. He looks upon me not only as an elder brother but he looks upon me as God Father. To make him happy, I worship. Besides I worship because I have a personal desire too. Greed. - I want you to get a very good and beautiful wife. Uncle, just last night a lot of girls had come. Where? - At home.. Why didn't you tell me? They came in my dreams. You were also in the dream. What was I doing there? Then daddy came, he slapped me. My eyes opened and I got up. Your daddy doesn't leave you alone even in your dreams! Uncle, why does he always chase me like the God of Death? You mustn't talk in this manner about your father! Your father is like a coconut. Hard from outside, but soft from within. Do you know why have these prayers been arranged today? I know. It's 'Shivratri' today. Not only that, you are getting a new motorbike today! What! What did you say? Look through the window. It's standing down. Thank you, Dad. Thank you very much. For what? - For giving me a motorcycle. Before expecting a motorcycle have you ever thought whether you deserve it or not? Your elder brother got 85 percent to become a computer engineer and even then I didn't buy him an ordinary bicycle. Your sister got 95 percent marks in her pre-medical. Even then I didn't buy her a watch. While you've just managed to pass with 36 percent marks. You are dreaming about a motorcycle! You are not even fit for a D.T.C. bus. Go away. I have purchased it to buy things for the house! Krishna, give me the keys of the motorcycle. Brother.. - Come on, give the key. Brother, please do not mind, but it's you, who has spoilt Karan. Your darling nephew has just managed to pass with 36 percent marks. He has passed, isn't it? Think of it like this! He is progressing in life. Progress? Of course! Last year, he had got 35 percent and this year 36 percent. He has improved, hasn't he? You won't get it. Sushma, get lassi for him. Karan, my son, wait. Karan! Karan, take the keys of the motorcycle! I don't want them. Listen, the motorcycle is for you. I don't want anything! - Listen to me.. Uncle, one day I will leave this house and go away. You are feeling bad because of what your father said. He's living in such a society. Let him do what he wants. We are of a different class. You see, this motorcycle has not been purchased by your father. I have purchased it for you, from my personal provident fund. Really? - Yes. I wanted him to give it. So that the miser does not feel embarrassed. It seems his luck is not too good. But my luck is very good! Here are the keys. Thank you, Uncle.. Thanks a lot. Good morning, Karan. - Good morning, sir. Won't you congratulate me, sir? What for? For the garland? No, sir. Look under it. - Oh. You've bought a new handle. No, sir. Not that. Well, you've bought a new bike. Congratulations. Well to celebrate this, look behind and there is your nice little college. So, my dear, why not attend a class today. Don't worry, sir. Before you retire I will definitely fulfil this wish of yours. Let's go. Listen, if you want, I can get your class shifted to the canteen. No, sir, don't do this, or we'll have to shift the canteen. Go, sir. The empty classroom must be waiting for you. If you don't pay up this month, I'll not spare you. - Relax, man. "Shoot me in the head.. My head is spinning.." What song are you rehearsing for? The function's song is different. You are worried about the rehearsal. Our lives are at stake here. Why? What happened? Do you know Ayesha? - Who? Encounter specialist Inspector Bhende's daughter. - So? Hrithik has written a love letter to her. - So what? - So what? Her father has shot many people during an encounter. He must be searching for Hrithik, and us to kill us. That's why we are singing this particular song. Sing with love, my friends. "Shoot me in the head." - But where is Hrithik? I am sitting here behind the drum and he's sitting there behind the drum. "Shoot me in the head!" Come on, my son. - Where? - There. He is Hrithik, but is not at all smart from any angle. Listen, why did you do this? - Actually, she used to stare at me. One stares at a circus joker too. Your mother named you Hrithik, so you took your name seriously. And wrote a love letter! Your friendship will get us also into trouble. Look, he's so tense, he's exercising. Why? - So that I can run. If they come to beat me, I'll take their side and tell you.. How dare you write a love letter to my sister! Beat him up.. Stop it. What are you doing? He's fallen in love, not committed a crime. He's already frightened and on top of that you are scaring him even further. Don't daughters of police inspector fall in love? Of course they fall in love. I read in the library that more than two lakh police inspectors daughters, have fallen in love. What a data you've collected! Come on. Hide. Run.. Move, she's my girlfriend. - Let me have a look. My darling is waking all alone. My dear, what a decision you've taken. Look at her face and look at yours. What's wrong with my face? My mother says I am one in a lakh! You are right. No one else can even look like you! Hey! A letter. A love letter. Go now. Go. Come on. - Are you sure? Hey, I got the love letter. Bahadur, send something cold to drink, and sandwiches too. Read it.. Should I read it? - Come on, read. Why are your hands shivering? Well it's the first love letter of my life, that's why! What is there to feel scared? Come on, read. Call for a van from the mental hospital. My dear Hrithik. What's happened to you? Are there springs in the letter? Have you ever seen your face in the mirror? On top of that you are writing a love letter in English. So many spelling mistakes. Who advised you to write this letter? Give him a kick from my side. Why are you kicking him? - It's written in this letter. Had someone else written this letter I would have complained to daddy and got him sent to prison. But after reading that your name was Hrithik I was so relieved. After that I began to love you. I love you, Hrithik. "The heart seeks for love.." "The heart seeks for love.." "The heart seeks for love.." "The heart seeks for love.." "Life is too short.. You are my princess.." "Life is too short.. You are my princess.." "I wish to find the love of my life.." "The heart seeks for love.." "The heart seeks for love.." "We go crazy in one day.. Be it the college or canteen." "We go crazy in one day.. Be it the college or canteen." "We see our lover everywhere. He is lost in his own dreams.." "He is ready to die for love." "The heart seeks for love.." "The heart seeks for love.." "When the world is asleep, he is awake and lonely." "He runs behind unknown faces." "When the world is asleep, he is awake and lonely." "He runs behind unknown faces." "His heart beats only for love.." "He does crazy stuff. He is a mad guy." "God knows where and whom he shall propose." "The heart seeks for love.." "The heart seeks for love.." Hi, Karan. - You! Where have you come from? - Let's go, I'll tell you later. Get off, get off.. - Please, I'm getting late. Shall I jump the signal because of your haste? The signal is clear. Let's go. You are so foolish. You can't even ride a bike. You are so slow. Please hurry, I'm getting late. First you insist on coming. On top of that you start ordering. If you are in a rush get a rickshaw. I will only drive at this speed. Please, Karan, I'm already late. Even I am getting late. Where to? - Keep quiet. - You are irritating! Hey, you are so late. - I am so sorry. Sorry, I couldn't find a rickshaw. - So she found me. Priya, who is this? Karan, my sweet, innocent foolish brother. Hi, Karan. - Hi. Karan, go home straight, I'll reach in the evening.. Okay? - Straight home? Straight home! Come home, I'll show you.. Greetings, Uncle. I said, greetings. Hey.. Hello, Mom. No one is ready to talk properly to me in this house. What is the matter with you people? What is it? Nothing has happened. Fine, what am I in this house. I'm leaving. Did you hear me, I'm going back to the hostel.. I've heard it.. I 'm not deaf. You said you'd come last week and you are coming now. For such a small thing all your moods are spoilt. You call this a small thing? Because of your insistence that your studies should not suffer we let you go to the hostel. Now the hostel is everything for you. The home and we are nothing to you. Mother, if I stay in this house, uncle and Karan will play games with me all night and my studies will be ruined. - Yes, that is so. Mother, your daughter wants to become a doctor and studying for that is not easy. I know, you are going to become a doctor but when you don't come home we all get upset. That's why I am here. Mom. Mom! - What? - Two grey hair. Why don't you dye it? Go and have a bath. I'm cooking okra for you. "What are you doing in my patio?" Greetings, sir. Bless you. Tell me, have you got a girl friend or not yet! I did find one but she is a flirt, you know. You fool, feed the birds with seeds of love then see how many birds come and perch there. You are really getting romantic today. - What did you say? Nothing at all, I was asking where Karan is. Hey. - Greetings, ma'am. - Bless you, son. Have you come to meet Karan? Is there any special plan? Yes, ma'am, I've come to study. Good, you take so much interest in studies and look at Karan. He's forever getting yelled at from his father. Explain to him. I keep telling him but he just doesn't listen to me. If I tell him something, he teases me by calling me a bookworm. As for my studies I am at them twenty-four hours. If the power goes off, I study under the street lights. Very good. Very good. Excellent, son. Fortunate are the parents who gave birth to a son like you. Ma'am, I am like a blessing to them from God. You! - Run! - Where are you going? He's Karan's friend and has come to study. Study! Have you ever seen a book? He stands in front of our college and stares at girls. Even after their scolding he stands there shamelessly. Very good.. Since he is Karan's friend I have to suffer this humiliation. What are you saying? She's joking, sir.. Joke? Day before yesterday a young girl was beating you with her slippers. Oh! Well I've already tied up with her. - What? See, Mom. Hasn't he accepted? How will my brother reform in such company? Don't dare to come here again! - Understand? - Yes. How was your journey? - Well. The train was late. Stop. Hi, Karan. Hello, sir. - You? - Where were you? I had gone to pick my brother up. Why? What Happened? Cheeku tried to commit suicide. - What are you saying? Where is he? Nothing has happened to him. Let's go to his house. - Come on. Keep calm now. With God's blessings your son's life has been saved. What happened to Cheeku? What shall I say, son? He failed in one subject and felt so dejected that he tried to commit suicide. What's happened to you, Cheeku? I saw your mark sheet. You got forty percent in maths. 36 in English, 38 in Hindi. Then which subject have you failed in? In love. - What do you mean? Pinky's father wants her to get married elsewhere. I thought that if Pinky can't be mine then what's the point of living, Karan.. That's why I did this. - But ma'am said something else. If he had told his mother the truth he wouldn't have had to commit suicide. His mother herself would have strangled him. Do something, Karan.. Don't you worry. You two will marry and it's my responsibility to get the girl. Oh, God. - Where are you going? Where are you going on the bike at this late hour? Daddy will wake up.. - But where are you going? It's Cheeku's birthday party today. All his friends are coming. - So? If the friends are coming then the girlfriend must also come, isn't it. So, I am going to get her. - Forcibly? Yes, her parents are not allowing her. It means you are going to kidnap her? - You are right. Have you gone mad? - Daddy will get up. As it is daddy remains upset with you. If you misbehave, he'll get more upset. That's his daily routine. - I won't let you go. Priya, understand. Cheeku needs my help. To hell with Cheeku. I won't let you go. What is this argument about? Now uncle too is awake. He's coming here. Now you just cannot go. Where are you going at this time? First send this problem inside. - Come on, you problem, go inside. But Uncle.. - Go inside. I'll handle him. Tell. Come closer.. I'm kidnapping a girl for my friend. You are doing a great thing. And there's another news. - What? I have taken five thousand rupees from your cupboard for this. - Good. Oh, this girl is in a burka? I cannot perform this marriage. Don't worry. She is a Hindu. Her name is Pinky. Her father's name is Brij Mohan Sharma. Yes, if you don't believe see my ID card. Is everything all right? - Everything is fine but Cheeku hasn't come yet. - Cheeku hasn't come yet? What will happen now, Karan? - Don't worry. He said he will reach on time. - Where are Darshan and Hrithik? They have gone to arrange for the police. We are the ones at fault and we are calling the police as well? I think they are here. Father.. Please don't create any trouble, sir. We are politicians, son. We haven't come here to create trouble. Thank you. You mean you are ready for this marriage? If you were going to agree so easily I jumped your boundary wall needlessly. I climbed on the pipe by tying this sari, and brought Pinky down. We arranged for the burka too. That's all fine but where is the groom? He must be coming, sir. - Is it? He is already here. Go ask him if he is ready for the marriage or not. Marriage? Sir, he's even ready for the honeymoon. What are you doing here, Cheeku? Come, take the circumambulations and your in-laws' blessings. I don't know what you are talking about, Karan. What happened? Is there a problem? I was the one who lost my head. I thought you might not reach with Pinky, so I reached there myself. The minister's guard caught me and beat me up so badly that I can't even tell you. What am I to tell you, my friend. Is that so? You sit here. I'll go deal with him. You turned out to be very crooked, sir. After all you are a politician. You are using your dirty tricks on your daughter's love also. - Keep quiet. That shorty will become my son-in-law? He is no less than a joker. Let's go. - No, Dad.. - Don't do this. Please. You idiot. Moron. Why don't you go kill yourself? Why are you after my life? Did I get you a bike so that you could kidnap girls? He is the only one in our family who has been to a police station. You went to the jail. You should be ashamed. Krishna, why are you parading him even on Diwali? What will the neighbours think when they hear? Let them hear. Let everyone hear. Only then will he come to his senses. Go to your room, son. Go help your mother, Priya. And you, are you sitting here to eat sweets? Go out and see if there are lights outside. - Okay. Krishna, many big politicians have been in the lock-up and our son had gone inside not because of any misdeed but because of good deeds. Is it a good deed to abduct someone's daughter? Who has told you that he had abducted someone's daughter? He has brought together two lovers. He has done a great deed. In fact I feel very proud of him. - This is the result of you giving him freedom. He is getting more spoilt each day. So you think all this is happening because of me? - Yes. That's fine. On this day Ramchandra had returned to Ayodhya. I will leave this house today and go. Brother, you are unnecessarily upset. You are saying things to upset me. Now why are you staring at me? Go and prepare for the veneration. - I am going.. - Go! Subedar Balram Singh, you are too good. Last night I'd told you not to go out, but you wouldn't listen. You said Cheeku needed your help. Now go and help him. God knows, till when you'll be involved with such friends. Daddy will keep scolding you, and uncle will keep on protecting you. Hey, rickshaw! Stop! Come on, change your mood now. Come on. - You go. I'll come later. - But where will you go now? The prayers are going to start. I'll say my prayers later on. You go now. - Let's go. I said, go! - All right. I'll go. Why are you shouting? Come on, kids. Let's go. Come on, get inside the car. Why are you sitting so quietly in the middle of the road, like a fool. Nothing. - My bike has run out of fuel because of you. Idiot. Why do you feel bad at what daddy said? Let's go. Everyone's waiting for you at home. Hop on. Hurry! Hurry up. I wonder what you were doing here.. The auspicious time was at 9:40 p.m. Just ten minutes left. Oh, God. Dad is already angry. God knows how he will react. "Ever since I saw you.." "I haven't seen that moon." "Ever since I saw you.." "I haven't seen that moon." "I have lost my heart.. I am wandering." "I have lost my heart.. I am wandering." "That's how much you have made me crazy.." "Ever since I saw you.. I haven't seen that moon." "When the cool breeze" "blows on my face.. I feel as if.." "You are nearby." "What magic have you done?" "That I have become so crazy." "The sky is bowing down.. Time has stopped.." "My heart beats only for you." "Ever since I saw you.." "I haven't seen that moon." "I see you in the garden and on the streets.." "I see you on the roads and crossings.." "Sometimes I see you in strangers, sometimes in dear ones." "I see you in my dreams as well.." "I look for you everywhere.." "I wish I find you very soon." "Ever since I saw you.. I haven't seen that moon." What happened to you? We were going to win the match! We couldn't win the match, but instead made enemies. At the most they will think that you threw the ball on purpose. What on earth where you thinking at that time? Dabboo, stop the car. I say, stop. - Why? What's wrong now? What's happened to you? - Leave me alone. But.. - Let's go. Who are you? Excuse me, this pouch of yours fell down. Oh, my God. It had my tickets and credit card. Thank you. It's all right. - Excuse me. Yes. Ma'am, I don't want a tip. I am not giving a tip. I want your autograph. - My autograph? Ma'am, I am not a hero that you need my autograph. According to me, every person who does a good job is a hero. You've done good work. Autograph please. - Okay. Pooja, where were you? We've been waiting for you. Why so late? - Sorry, I got late. - Pooja, without you there's no fun in the party. - Sorry. From the last one hour, everyone is wanting to know the whereabouts of the girl, for whom this party is held. My dear, I enquired the most. - Do you recognise him? Mr. Chandrabhavan! From Shimla? - Good. You recognised him at once. How can I not recognise you? Papa always talks about you. You were his college friend. Even in the family album your photographs, right from childhood are there. Papa remembers you a lot uncle. - Yes, my dear. Raj Saxena was a very good friend of mine. He was a great scholar. When I heard about your mummy and papa's death in a plane crash I felt very sad. I've lost a wonderful friend. After marriage, this is what happens. Yesterday I went to my girlfriend's house. Her mother welcomed me nicely. In the meantime the scrap dealer called, and wanted to know, whether there was any old stuff in the house. She told him that there was old stuff lying in the house but right now he has gone to the office! You are fooling around here. Have you seen Karan? Let him be now. These days he is lost in his own strange world. At least try to find out where exactly is he lost? All right, ma'am.. Let's go. - Karan. - Come on.. Hey, Karan. Karan, why are you behaving like this? Is there any problem? Did someone tell you anything? I don't know. I just cannot concentrate these days. What has happened to him? Guys, it's of no use. It won't kill any mosquito. Why? - These days there is so much pollution that even the mosquitoes are moving around with gas masks! That was lame. Hey, stop! Stop please! I say, stop please! What's wrong? Where is he running? What happened to him now? Karan, where are you going? - What's happened? Tell us what's the matter? Tell us where are you going? - She'll go away. Who? - She.. "He's not suffering from a cold.." - Karan. "Or a cough but he's fallen in love." "Fallen in love." - Take this.. Congratulations, friends. From now on, we are all sailing in the same boat. Till now only Karan was not involved but now he too is madly in love with that pretty girl. It's not what you guys are thinking. I want to talk to that girl just once and ask her who she is. 'What is your name? What is your relationship with me?' Why is that I can't stop thinking about you, even for a moment? Why have you stolen my sleep? Karan, my dear friend. You are so obsessed in her love. Am I right? Tell me.. Tell me what is her category? - Category? Cheeku, the time has come for you to give him a lecture about the categories of girls and their general knowledge. Students, in our campus, there are 7 girls college, 6 Junior Colleges and 14 co-educational colleges. In all these colleges 14,810 girls study. They all come under different categories and I will teach him about all this. First category is 'A', that is the Deluxe category. I have no words to praise girls who fall in this category. There are 2,800 girls in this category. The second category is 'B' and in this there are 3,445 girls. It's because of them that all beauty and cosmetic parlours run. If they were not around all the beauty parlours would have shut down. Because of them lipsticks, powder and cosmetics are sold. The third category is the 'C' category. They don't look that great or happening, you know. In this there are maximum number of girls, that is, 4,445. No matter which girl you look at they won't look like girls to you. Thank you, Professor Shankar Mahadevan. Don't be breathless. Now tell us which is your category? - A class. He is doomed. I belong to the 'C' category. Chasing a girl from this category, I lost half my hair. You are chasing a girl from the 'A' category? I don't know what you will lose. I have to meet that girl under any circumstances. My friend, you don't know her name nor her address. How exactly will your find her? Hail Lord Shiva.. Here, Mom.. - You also come along, son. Mother, you carry on. What will I do there? You shouldn't say so, son. If you pray with all your heart your wish will be granted. I won't find her in the temple, will I? What? - No, it's nothing. Come on, or else, your father will scold you. That is his daily routine. Please go. The veneration is about to start. "You came closer and smiled.." Where has this Pooja gone? Excuse me. Your name is Karan, right? - Yes. Someone is calling you. - Karan.. Karan, you are sitting here. Your papa has been looking for you. Come on, it's time for the prayers to begin. Mother, you were right when you said that one can get everything by prayers. Thanks for bringing me here, Mom. Karan, where are you going? Pooja, where did you go away? Sorry. It's such a beautiful temple. I got so many photos. Come on, it's very late already. Come on, let's go. Come on. Look at him. You idiot. Even in the temple, you are up to tricks. What's over there? Dad.. - Come on, say your prayers. Stupid. Manu, can you drop me? I have an important interview. Why! Has your father filled the petrol? Go by bus. The interview time is twelve and it's already twelve. Why are you crying? Don't worry. Your work will be done. Here comes that innocent angel. Hi, Karan. - Hi. What's it? These days you are being talked about everywhere? Why? - I've heard, that you are looking for some girl. Found her? No, man. - Had you gone there? - What's there? Actually every Saturday there's a jam session. Specially for girls. All the girls go there. Go and try there. Where is this building? - In Friend's colony. Wait. He is going there. Drop him please. Sure. - Go on now.. I made a fool of that idiot. Listen, my interview is scheduled here. Just wait, I'll come in half an hour. Then I'll come along with you and search for that girl of yours! Listen, Sharma. Come here. If you had told me frankly that you had an interview lined up here do you think I wouldn't have dropped you? I'm sorry, buddy. - You fool. It's all right this time. In future if you try to fool with me, I'll really set you right. Go now and best of luck. - Thank you. I think she has gone upstairs. "Oh, my darling.." "My crazy heart is looking for you." "It's really difficult to" "hide my feelings now." "Oh, my darling.." "My crazy heart is looking for you." "It's really difficult to hide my feelings now." "I kept quiet for so long but not anymore." "I want to say something.." "I want to say something.." "I want to say something.." "Seasons kept changing and my heart was yearning.." "I was so engrossed in your thoughts.." "Seasons kept changing and my heart was yearning.." "I was so engrossed in your thoughts.." "I don't want to be away" "from you anymore.." "I want to say something.." "I want to say something.." "I want to say something.." "I might cross my limits.. I might just stop here." "I don't want to die yearning for you.." "I might cross my limits.. I might just stop here." "I don't want to die yearning for you.." "I want to lay down" "my life for you.." "I want to say something.." "I want to say something.." "I want to say something.." So. You saw that girl and lost your sleep and peace of mind.. Etcetera.. I think you've fallen in love with her! Right? - Right. From which film is this scene? Film scene? It's the truth, Priya. My dear sweet innocent foolish brother. You think that this is love but it's not. It's just attraction. Only attraction. Attraction? - Obviously. Only attraction? - Of course! What else? Let's go, Priya. - Where are you going? Just wait here. Priya. From the time I've seen that girl I have no control over my emotions. I feel as if I have been robbed. In my sleep, I stay awake and I don't know in which world I just get lost. And here you are saying that it's attraction. Karan. Priya, I had thought that you were the only one who would understand me. If I confess all this to you maybe my heart will become lighter. But.. - Karan, I'm sorry. I misunderstood your feelings. Don't worry, I am with you. What is that girl's name? - I don't know. Good.. Where does she stay? - I don't know. Very good.. Her mom, dad.. - I don't know. Superb, excellent. If you know so much about her.. I mean you don't know anything about her then this confirms that you really love her. Thank you. - What's there to thank me? I was doing my duty as a sister. Whatever her name is now she is going to be my future sister-in-law. Excuse me! Listen! Hello! Hello.. Excuse me! Listen! I must take his autograph. Excuse me, sir. Please call him. - Yes. Excuse me. Call him. Excuse me. Please call him. Hello. Call him. Sir, call him. Hi, Karan. - Hi, Priya. Hi. - Priya. What are you doing here? Can you drop me to the hostel? Sorry, we have a rehearsal just now. Take a rickshaw. Tell one of your friends to drop me. Come, I'll drop you. - Just a minute. Priya, you go by rickshaw everyday then what's the problem today? Actually, Karan.. I didn't want to tell you but on the way some boys tease me. Come with me. Karan, please.. Karan, stop. Karan. - Hop on. I'll take care of them. Karan, stop it. Please, Karan, stop it. Oh, my! They are the ones, right? - Please, Karan, stop it. Stop it, Karan. They are dangerous. Hey.. He got scared. Coward. Hey! Who did you say this to? What did you say? Oh, my! Take the name of the Lord. - Hail to Him! I will not spare you. I will not spare you - Hey. You are dead! - We are here. Stop! - Enough. Let us go from here. You arrive when the fight is over! - Dabbu! Stop it! Come on. Come on, let us go now. - Just stop it. - Come on. Come on. Bhaskar, I am very worried about my younger son, Karan. What happened to Karan? He does not concentrate on his studies. I want to send him to Shimla, to you. If he stays with you and studies for a few months then he may get better marks in this year's exams. Don't worry, send him immediately. - Thank you, pal. Priya, I don't understand why you all are forcing me to go when I don't want to? Because if you stay here, neither you nor your friends will study. And dear, if you don't come first this time then neither I nor uncle will be able to save you from father's scolding. Priya, why don't you understand there are things, other than studying, in this world. I know what work you have! You are thinking about that girl. Don't worry. We will both look for her after your exams are over. That is fine, but what if she falls in love with someone else after I leave? I will then have only her name to chant. You don't know, Priya, nowadays the competition is so tough that boys have to stand in queues for a beautiful girl. My dear, sweet, innocent, foolish brother. Girls don't love like that. Look at me. Do you think I will love anyone who comes my way? Hey, I was talking about beautiful girls, not you. What! - Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Pooja, is there any emergency? Why have you suddenly decided to go to Shimla? Uncle Chandra Mohan is a very dear friend of father's. He is not well. I will stay with him for a few days to give him company. Karan. Karan. Karan. Hey, Priya, this does not have my name! No reservation. Come, let us go home. Hey, mister, this compartment is S-4. And your reservation is in S-2. Come, let us go there. Come on. Why don't you leave? - There is still time left. Hey! - Yes. - Hello! Hello! Excuse me. Hello! - Oh, my God. - Pooja. - Pooja. Pooja, where are you going? - Where are you going? Come on. Come on, go in. Hello.. Who was he, Pooja? Who was he? The autograph guy? - Yes. - Oh, no. Come on. Come on. - Come on, the train is about to leave. Bye, Pooja. - Bye. - Bye. Take care of yourself. Okay, Pooja? - Bye, take care. Bye-bye. - Bye. "Follow me by my trail and watch before you come." How long will it take, mister? Only the car knows that. She is upset. - Hurry up. You are just singing songs. Sir, the car belongs to the mountains. Only a song will make her work. Mister, keep on singing. I will hitch a ride to Shimla. No, son.. Don't take a lift. There are terrorists in some vehicles. They may kidnap a rich boy like you. I will not let you go. I will take you, man. Oh, God. I missed the car because of you. Father had to punish me like this. Even Priya did not listen to me. She dumped me in these mountains. I could have found that girl had I stayed in Delhi. Why is the car reversing? Hi. Hi! - Did your car break down? Can I help you? Well, I want to go to Shimla. - All right, I will take you. Driver. - Yes, ma'am. - Help him. I will drive the car. - Okay, ma'am. Come. - Yes. Okay, mister. See you later. Bye-bye! Great! He started speaking English as soon as he saw a girl! Hi, I am Pooja. - Karan. - Nice to meet you. Thank you for this great help. Or else, I would have been stuck in these mountains. I have learnt from you that one should always help someone in trouble. From me? - Yes. You remember you saved a child from falling off a bike in Chanakyapuri? Yes. Now see how people unwittingly lose their most precious things. Like me. - Like you? What else? I ran after you to get your autograph. But the traffic light changed, and you left. Then I saw you at Nizamuddin station. I called out to you. I even ran towards the door. But I saw that you vanished again. Karan, I think your work is done. And then, we met in a temple before that. Yes, in the temple. And after that, in these hills. Karan, you are so interesting. Oh, God. - Oh, God! Karan! - Pooja! Pooja, brakes! Pooja! Be careful, Pooja! Pooja, brakes! Oh, God! Pooja, get out! Hold me tight, Pooja. Pooja, go! Go, Pooja. Come on, Pooja, try. Pooja, go up. Pooja, try. Come on, Pooja. Come on, Pooja. Try, Pooja. Come on. Try, Pooja, try! Come on, Pooja! - Karan! Karan! Come on, Pooja. Come on. Pooja! Pooja, try. Come on, Pooja. - Karan! Pooja, come on. Karan. - Pooja, hold me. Pooja, come on, try. Pooja, come on. Pooja. - Karan! - Pooja! Karan! Good evening, Mr. Singh. How is my niece, doctor? Has she regained consciousness? Don't worry, she is all right. - Yes? Come. - Thank you. Pooja. Dear Pooja.. Karan! Boss, what took you so long? It is not easy to cut and load sandalwood trees. Come on and sit down quickly. Hey, who is he? He was hanging from a tree. I think he must have tried to commit suicide. Is he dead or alive? - He is still breathing. We will drop him at a nearby hospital. - Come on. Uncle, any news of Karan? All this happened because of me. He was going his own way. I gave him a lift. Who was he, where does he stay.. How devastated his parents will be when they come to know! I feel very scared when I think of all this, Uncle. It will come. - Chiku, did you find out? We searched all the bungalows in the city. But we could not find her anywhere. Someone's father abused us and shooed us away. - Yes. Someone sent dogs at us. - What else! There is not a place left where we have not looked. I think she is not in this city. - Yes. Who says that the girl is not in this city? I do. - You fools, nincompoops, donkeys! If you all lose hope so easily then I will use my slippers and throw you all out of this house. Karan, I have found out about the girl. What! - Her name is Pooja, is it not? I told you her name. But you did not tell me that she is from America. - No. And you also did not tell me that she is here doing a research on Indian culture. - No. And you did not tell me that she is staying with her uncle, Rana Virendra Pratap Singh. Then you must also know her address. No, son, that is the only thing I could not find out. Why? - Because they managed to get our address! What? - Yes! Hi, Karan. How are you feeling? - Better. Much better. A lot better now. I am sorry, Karan. The truck driver was driving so rash so fast.. Suddenly he came in the front and I lost control of the steering wheel. I am sorry, Karan. Son, I have no words with which I can thank you. You have done me a big favour by saving her life. Autograph, please. Autograph? - Yes. Whenever she meets a nice person she takes their autograph to remember them by. Very good. Very good. Even I will start this habit from tomorrow. But I will take autographs of rude people. Krishna. - Yes? The first autograph will be yours. Brother, you are too much.. This one is for today. I need a second autograph for the day you saved that child's life. - Oh. Very good. Very good. Boy, this is great! The girl you were looking for came here looking for you. Now don't play this love game like a test match. Play it like a one-day match. What are you thinking of? Tell her in your next meeting, I love you. You fool, listening to uncle will do you no good. Has he ever romanced anyone in his life that he is giving your ideas? Then tell me what should I do? Look, Karan, Pooja is a smart and mature girl. According to me you should try to become her friend before saying I love you. Deepen your friendship first. It may take time but don't worry, when you get closer to her heart as a friend then that will be the right time to say I love you. Then she herself will say, I love you, Karan! Your sister is a doctor not a philosopher. She can cure just colds and coughs. You fool, do you know what will happen if you listen to your sister? What will happen? - It will take you six months to befriend her. Another six to get close to her. And when after six months you will say I love you she will say, I am getting married in the next six months. Hey, why are you all talking rubbish and chewing his brains? Priya is more intelligent than all of us put together. She will be correct, no matter what she says. Yes, he is right. - Yes, Mr. Undecided. So first friendship, and then I love you. But Dabbu, how will I know that she also wants to be my friend? Brother, if she has any feelings for you she will surely come to your house today. If she comes, then think that she too has some feelings for you, my dear. And what if she does not? If she does not, then she does not feel anything, my friend. Come on in. So, you finally found time to come home. Where were you? Father, I had my orchestra rehearsals. Breaking your bones did not satisfy you! If you really like to play in a band so much, then stop studying. And start playing drums in wedding parties. Then at least your hobby will bring in some money. Now, why are you staring at me? Eat and go to sleep. Useless! And listen, she was here. What is her name? Pooja. What? Pooja was here? Why do you need to get so excited because of Pooja? No. No, nothing like that. When did she come, Father? - I forget when she came. Forget about Pooja and tell me are you attending the tuitions I paid for? I will go, Father. I will go from tomorrow. Priya. - Yes. - Did Pooja come here? Yes. - Did she say something? Yes she did. - What? She said, Priya, where is my love? Where is my Karan? Now that I am here, I must marry him. Stupid, you always joke about everything. Hey, crazy lover, be careful. Uncle. Uncle, was Pooja here? Did she meet you? Was Pooja here? She did not meet me. Then whom did she meet? Father said she was here. Hey, naive, you still don't know your father. He is a very shrewd man. Extremely shrewd. He took Pooja's name to know your feelings. He wanted to see the expression on your face. And you thought that he was telling the truth. Son, you get upset so easily. Come here. Come here.. Sit down. Pooja did come here. What? - And she sat with me for a very long time. She had snacks, drank tea. And she was talking about you. Really, Uncle? - Yes. Yes! Yes! - Your hand! Priya, Pooja was here! My dear, sweet, innocent, foolish brother. You have won love's semi-finals. Now prepare for the finals. The finals. - Yes! "Your eyes really enchanted me." "Your eyes really enchanted me." "Your eyes really enchanted me." "Your eyes really enchanted me." "I am not the one to be blamed! You had fallen for my beauty!" "I am not the one to be blamed! You had fallen for my beauty!" "You gazed upon me and you stole my heart!" "And took away my soul!" "I am not the one to be blamed! You had fallen for my beauty!" "You gazed upon me and you stole my heart!" "And took away my soul!" "I am not the one to be blamed! You had fallen for my beauty!" "You are so beautiful and stunning" "that the entire world is crazy about you!" "My beauty is overwhelming that one can't help to fall in love with me!" "Tell me about your own experience and forget about the world!" "You'll know my feelings without telling you!" "Oh, I am the special one!" "Just tell me that you are mine." "You gazed upon me and you stole my heart!" "And took away my soul!" "I am not the one to be blamed! You had fallen for my beauty!" "I am not the one to be blamed! You had fallen for my beauty!" "I am not the one to be blamed! You had fallen for my beauty!" "I don't know who has stolen my heart?" "I have never seen one who has stolen your heart!" "Why do my anklets chime, can you tell me?" "Why don't you come near me I will tell you in your ears!" "Don't you touch my beautiful arms!" "So why don't you give me your heart instead?" "You gazed upon me and you stole my heart!" "And took away my soul!" "I am not the one to be blamed! You had fallen for my beauty!" "Your eyes really enchanted me." "I am not the one to be blamed!" "Your eyes really enchanted me." "I am not the one to be blamed! You had fallen for my beauty!" "I am not the one to be blamed! You had fallen for my beauty!" Oh, dear, I think you work too hard. Come on, why don't you go to sleep now? Well, Uncle, I will just send this email to my friend! Friend or a boyfriend? Uncle! Oh, well, I mean it is late and your eyes look lost. I can see dreams about your boyfriend in your eyes. You are absolutely wrong, Uncle. I am a 21st century girl. I know the value of time. I am not dreaming about boyfriends. I have more important goals to achieve in life. Oh, I see! And may I know what your goal is, dear? Uncle, I would like to fulfil my father's dream. I would like to tell the whole world about our great Indian culture. I want to get admission in Harvard university. So that people say with pride hey, that girl is from the Pratap family! What is the matter, Uncle? Well, you are just like your father, Raj! He had the same confidence and dedication! I am proud of you, dear. I mean, you are so determined at such a tender age! I am confident that you will fulfil Raj's dream! "Today is a special day for me.." Hey, Karan, meet my friends! They are from my hostel. Hi, girls! - Hi, Karan! All right! Don't you get too excited! Relax! Karan, my friends are here for the 'Teej' festival. Why don't you wear something suitable? What will they think? This dress is perfect for your friends. Priya, just see, you look so beautiful in this photo! You know, the album is full of photos like that. Is it not so, Brother? - Yes, of course! Shall I show you some more photographs? - Yes! Yes! 'Well, she is full of self-praise, is she not?' 'I have a plan!' Look, this photograph is from my school days. Oh, Priya, you look so smart! Girls, would you like to see another beautiful photograph of Priya's? She is bald in that! Bald, you know! Yes, yes, why not! No, Karan! Please don't show that photograph! Why not? What is wrong with the photograph? I will hit you if you show it to them! All right, then let me show it to them. Here it is! You.. I will get you for this! You just wait! Try and catch me! Come on, Priya! - Where will you run to? Catch me! - Just you wait! - What is this spectacle? Come here! Priya, come here! What are you two doing? - Mother! Look at him, Mother! Remember that photograph which you had taken after my hair was shorn off! - Yes. Well, he showed that to my friends. Everyone will tease me about it now! Karan, why do you always pester her? Come on, stop dancing around and apologise to your sister! - Yes! Come on! - Mother, did you see that? Karan! - Karan! I will get you for this! - Catch me! I will get you for this! Karan! Come out! You teased me in front of my friends! Priya! This is it! Throwing colour on me? Who do you think you are? Hi, Pooja! - Hi, Priya! Why is he looking like a cartoon? She has done this to me! - Oh, very good! Very good! Welcome, dear Pooja! Welcome! God bless you! Well, I must say, you stay in America but you have not forgotten our Indian culture! Uncle, I am doing the research on our culture so how can I forget it? So, I think this place is perfect for your thesis! What is going on here? Dear, today is the 'Teej' festival! All the women and girls adorn their hands with henna, wear bangles and do their shopping at home. They sit on swings and sing seasonal songs too! Wow! I also want to participate in this. Yes, why not! Take part and write about it too! Yes! Hey, why do you look like a monkey? Just go and wash your face, okay! - Oh. Come out of the cartoon channel and re-join the family channel! Go! Run! Karan, I really felt good coming to your house today. I have never been so happy before. You know, one never gets to see this kind of love and affection in America! It becomes difficult to spend time there. Hey! Karan is with a girl! Oh! Buddies! I think he has her! I am sure he will take her to a matinee show. So, tell me, what do you do? Well, I am supposed to be studying now. But I don't enjoy it at all. So my father keeps scolding me. Well, at your age, young folks focus only on studies. So, what interests you? - Well, I don't really know! Who are these fellows staring at us? They are all loafers from the neighbourhood. You know, they are from rich families. They don't study at all and just fool around. What do I tell you? I just don't pay any attention to people like these! You are very sensible to stay away from such company.. Karan! Karan! Oh, you! You called us ruffians, goons! - What happened? Well, the moment you see the girl, you give her your heart and ignore us? The moment you get her attention, you discard us? You did not even introduce her to us? Stupid fellows! First let me find out if she loves me or not! I am just a friend now. And if I introduce you to her you will be her friends too! Then there will not be any difference between you and me! That is why I was avoiding you! Where did you disappear, Karan? Well, I had just gone for a drink of water. For a drink? - Pooja, tell me something. You live alone in America. Don't you have any boyfriends? Of course! There is this Harry, my classmate! He is a really nice fellow. He always scores more than me in studies. I really like him. He is my best friend! Hello! - Yo! - Greetings! - Greetings! We are not loafers, we are Karan's friends! Karan, are they your friends? - Yes, I mean, kind of.. Why are you stuttering? He won't introduce us to you! So we will do the needful. Yo! I am Chiku! - Chiku? I am Ronnie! I don't want to praise myself! Sandy, why don't you tell her? Well before his birth, his father wanted a boy and his mother wished for a girl. So you know, God got perplexed. So God sent him with qualities of a boy and a girl both! Well, I am Dabbu! And let me tell you something about him. Well the government couldn't fulfil their five year plan but he managed to fulfil his! And how is that? Well, when we met him, he was five years senior to us! But just for our friendship, ma'am he waited for us in one class for five years! And from that moment on, we are all together! It is really nice to meet you. Well, you will jump with joy, when you will hear our orchestra! Orchestra? - Yeah, didn't Karan tell you? He is a very good guitarist! Karan, you are so talented. Why did you hide this from me? So where do you guys do your rehearsals? Right there! - There? Great! But Pooja, I don't think you would be interested in all this? What do you mean? - Well, it means that you are the studious and intelligent type! Well, I am studious! And I am intelligent! But I am not boring. - Oh.. If you guys can rock with musical instruments then I am a very good dancer too! Wonderful! This is perfect! We need a girl for our college function tomorrow! That is it! You will help us, won't you, Pooja? I sure will! See you on the floor! "It's not yellow, it's not blue! It's neither black nor it's white!" "My drape is just spic-and-span!" "It's not yellow, it's not blue! It's neither black nor it's white!" "My drape is just spic-and-span!" "My soul is moving! And so is my body!" "My body is moving! And so is my soul!" "If your heart really desires.." "If your heart really desires" "then come forward and colour my drape!" "Yeah, just colour my drape!" "My soul is moving! And so is my body!" "My body is moving! And so is my soul!" "If your heart really desires.." "If your heart really desires" "then come forward and colour my drape!" "Yeah, just colour my drape!" "It's not yellow, it's not blue! It's neither black nor it's white!" "My drape is just spic-and-span!" "It's not yellow, it's not blue! It's neither black nor it's white!" "My drape is just spic-and-span!" "It's not yellow, it's not blue! It's neither black nor it's white!" "My drape is just spic-and-span!" "People are just crazy about me!" "They are ready to give up their life for me!" "Be quick before someone comes and steals my heart!" "But nobody has won my heart yet." "If your heart really desires.." "If your heart really desires" "then come forward and colour my drape!" "Yeah, just colour my drape!" "It's not yellow, it's not blue! It's neither black nor it's white!" "My drape is just spic-and-span!" "It's not yellow, it's not blue! It's neither black nor it's white!" "My drape is just spic-and-span!" "It's been years, since I had awakened with feeling of love!" "I have guarded my heart with lot of care!" "If you want me with heart and soul!" "I welcome you with my heart open!" "Just marry me and take me away!" "If your heart really desires.." "If your heart really desires" "then come forward and colour my drape!" "Yeah, just colour my drape!" "My soul is moving! And so is my body!" "My body is moving! And so is my soul!" "If your heart really desires.." "If your heart really desires" "then come forward and colour my drape!" "Yeah, just colour my drape!" "My soul is moving! And so is my body!" "My body is moving! And so is my soul!" "My soul is moving! And so is my body!" "My body is moving! And so is my soul!" "My soul is moving! And so is my body!" "My body is moving! And so is my soul!" "My soul is moving! And so is my body!" "My body is moving! And so is my soul!" Well, according to your sister's plan you have befriended Pooja! So when will you say, I love you' to her? Tell me! Well, every day you park your vehicle in front of her house, but you never go inside! Why? Dabbu, I really have no idea. But I feel jittery you know! Hey, what are you afraid of? She had come to your house twice, right! So just tell her that I was just around here. And so I thought I might drop by to say hello! Well, what if she finds out that I deliberately did this? Hey, what has happened to you, buddy? Remember, you had abducted the MLA's daughter for Chiku! - Yes. So if you can help him, then why don't you help yourself? Now go! Be brave! Just go inside and tell her everything! Come on, go! Oh, God! Just help him out! I beg of you. Wow! Uncle, what a shot! - That is a beauty! Hey, come on in, Karan. How are you? I am fine. - Harry, meet Karan! - Yes! This fellow put his own life in danger to save Pooja's life! Okay! - Daring young boy! Hello. - Nice to meet you! Karan, Harry is soon going to be our son-in-law! 'Well, there is this Harry. He is my classmate!' 'He is really a nice fellow.' 'I really like him. He is my best friend!' Mr. Chaudhary, I think we are really fortunate to have met people like you - Oh, thanks a lot! Forgive us, if there has been some mistake from our side. - Oh, no! Oh, here comes our most beloved son! - Hey, where were you? Oh, come on, can't you control yourself in front of guests? Mr. Chaudhary, this is my younger brother, Karan! Hello! - Hello! Please come, Mr. Chaudhary! - Yes. Come. - Okay! See you! Brother, who are these people? - Well, they had come to see Priya! And the alliance is confirmed too! With whom? - He is right there! Dr. Rajesh! Him. Bye! Come on! 'Mother, I am going to marry a pilot!' 'I mean, he must have deep blue eyes' 'be handsome, have stylish hair!' 'I guess we will have to design such a special pilot for you' 'on the computer!' 'No, dear, we will get you married to a doctor!' 'No, Mother, I will remain unmarried all my life' 'but I will never marry a doctor! - Why?' 'I mean, he will behave like a doctor at all times.' 'Even when he comes home from the hospital!' 'But how can we find you a pilot?' 'Well, what is he there for?' 'My dear, sweet, innocent, stupid brother! He will find him for me.' Mother! Mother! Why are you marrying Priya to a man who does not deserve her? Hey, you, he is not a nincompoop like you! He is a doctor! And he makes a lot of money. Father, don't you interfere! I am not talking to you. Priya can't be forced to marry a man just because you have chosen him for her! Karan, how can you say this? - Yes, Mother, I am right! Hey, Karan, why are you arguing like this? Come on over here. - Uncle, you don't know! But I know Priya's choice very well. So I will never let father ruin Priya's life! Hey, Karan, why don't you listen to me? Do you think we are forcing Priya to marry him? Priya has taken her own decision. What? - Yes! No! This can't be! Priya! Priya! Priya, what is all this? Come and tell father that you are not ready for this marriage! Come on, Priya! Are you mad? - Yes! Because I know your choice! And you are taking this decision under father's pressure! Come on, Priya! - Karan, this is my own decision! Yes! This is my decision! Rajesh is my senior in college! For the last three years he has been in love with me! And only a few days ago he managed to tell me this with great difficulty. So what? You should have told him that you don't love him, and he can find someone else! If Pooja says the same thing to you, what will you do then? I guess, you are even afraid to think about it! Yes, even I thought that I shouldn't break his heart and agreed to marry him! So it means that, just for his happiness you are ready to sacrifice your own life? No, it is not a sacrifice! I felt love for him when I saw that he adores me so much! And looks don't matter! I know that he will keep me happy! And I will be happy with him too! Hey, why are you so upset? I know. Because your sister won't be here, right? Don't worry. When I leave after marriage, Pooja will come here after marrying you! Son, I am not really getting this. Why are you leaving for Mumbai when your leave is not over yet? Mother, you don't understand! If I go earlier this time then I will get extra leave during Priya's wedding! Mother, why are you giving me this pickle? You get everything there! Brother, I would also like to come to Mumbai with you tomorrow. Why? What don't you have over here? No, it is nothing. But I don't want to live in this city. Thank God! Finally he realised this! Pankaj, take him with you. Father, don't take him so seriously! Hey, everyone from this house has done well in studies! Will you at least get your degree or not? Do you think it is a great achievement to get a degree? Well, I say, go and book his ticket tonight itself. Hi, Karan! - Oh, hi! Well, uncle told me that you had come home? And when I called Priya, she told me that you are going to Mumbai? Is there anything special? I mean how come you suddenly decided to go? No! Nothing special. I mean, for how long can I take father's taunts? He has to face a lot of trouble because of me. Well, you tell me, so when is the wedding day? No, you tell me first. You met Harry, right? So how did you find him? - He is very nice! Honestly, Karan, I really feel that anyone will be fortunate to have a man like Harry! I can't really tell you how nice he is! I had introduced him to uncle when he came for the first time to India. And that was when he fell in love! And you know what? Uncle was not ready for the marriage! But I didn't budge and told him that the wedding will be possible only with Harry! Karan, can you imagine how lucky Simmi is? Simmi? - Yes, Simmi! She is getting married to Harry. Simmi? - Well, why are you so surprised? You talk as if you don't know Simmi! No! No! I do, I mean, I know her very well! Wait a minute! Just one minute. Just one minute, I will be back! Yes! Oh, man, God is great! Yes! Karan! Karan! Karan! It is time for the train, where are.. Oh, Pooja, you and here? - Hello! Hello! - Brother, one minute! - What? Pooja, just a minute! - What is it? Brother, I am not going to Mumbai! - What? But why not? If I go to Mumbai, my studies will get affected. You guys studied as much as you wanted. Why shouldn't I then? Oh, I see! Father was absolutely right! He said that you can change your mind at any time. I stood in the queue for six hours to get your tickets! And now you don't.. I am going now! Bye, Pooja! Bye! - Brother! - What is it? You know what, my pocket money is over. So why don't you leave Rs. 2,000 with mother? Oh, I see! Fine! - Okay, Brother, see you! Come on, Karan! Karan, will you call me when you reach Mumbai? Mumbai? Who is going to Mumbai? You? - Well, I am not going to Mumbai! - Why? Well, brother was getting worried. He said I am a kid now. There is still time for me to start working! First complete your studies, and then you can get a job. So what have you decided? I thought the same. You know, Pooja, I must concentrate on my studies now! Very good! Very good! Karan, where are your friends? I can't see them around! Today is Sunday, so everyone has gone to the disco! And you are not going? Well, don't you know one needs a partner to go to the disco? And I don't have a partner. You really want to go to the disco? - Yes! Okay then get to my place by 6 p.m. in the evening tomorrow. I will be your partner for the disco. - Yes! "O' dear God!" "O' dear God!" "O' dear God!" "O' dear God!" "O' dear God!" "What should I call this love, this passion?" "O' dear God! O' dear God!" "What should I call this love, this passion?" "O' dear God!" "How can I appease my restless mind?" "How can I appease my restless mind?" "What should I call this love, this passion?" "O' dear God! O' dear God!" "O' dear God! O' dear God!" "I feel lonely and passionate just because of you." "All I can think is of is you." "O' dear God! O' dear God!" "I really feel helpless because I can't tell you my feelings!" "You are close to my heart and yet you're so far away!" "My silence is not enough to convey my feelings!" "How can I appease my restless mind?" "What should I call this love, this passion?" "O' dear God!" "What should I call this love, this passion?" "O' dear God!" "How can I appease my restless mind?" "O' dear God! O' dear God!" "My love for you has now crossed all the limits!" "You have no idea, how much I love you.." "O' dear God! O' dear God!" "I have become so engrossed in you" "that I can hear your heart's desires!" "And I don't know how to satisfy that desire!" "O' dear God!" "How can I appease my restless mind?" What! Wow, my parcel has come. Hey, have patience. First tell me, what is there in this? Postcards! Only postcards. Postcards! Okay then I will give them to your father he can use them to write letters. No, Uncle, please don't give it to him. Then tell me first, what is there inside this? I will tell you! First give it to me. Shall I give it? - Please, Uncle! - So take it! Hey, these are so many pieces of card board! Have you decided to leave your studies and become a scrap dealer? No, Uncle, there is a beautiful picture in these cards. What do you mean? Actually, tomorrow is Pooja's birthday. I want to gift her this and without saying anything verbally I will express my love to her. How? - I will show you right now. Wow! So, Uncle, isn't my love getting expressed through this? Who made this design, son? - One of my friends. Your friend is a fool. - Why? Son, you can put all this together, but if you give this to Pooja she will make a mess of her face. These are all old tricks! Be a modern lover! Modern! Have you seen that movie 'Darr'? - Yes. In that, actor Shah Rukh Khan had written the name of his beloved on his chest, K-Kiran! Think something like that. Think son, think! Idea! Hi, Karan! - Oh, hi, Pooja! Happy birthday to you. Hey, what is all this? Suit, shoes and sun shades.. Today you are looking like a hero. Hey, it is all because it is your birthday today. Yes, it is! Pooja, I was thinking that you belong to a very rich family. I was expecting a very big party and lots of people song and dance, just like the way it is in films. But there is nothing happening over here. Karan, come on. Come, Karan, come in. Look at this, it is for you. For our friendship. Hey, what is this? It is me who should be giving you something today. Doesn't make any difference. No! No! Don't open it. Go home and open it. I won't like it. - Okay! Yes, where is my birthday gift? I am not going to leave it. Hold on, hold on. Here it is. - Wow! Open and see it, I will like it. - Okay. Oh, how nice! Something special? See it properly. There is something special in it. Really? Karan, you.. I have written it with my blood. What! What a silly joke! How disgusting! Are you mad? Have you gone crazy? I had never imagined that you would do such a stupid thing. Why do you upset me, Karan? Why! Karan, I don't like all this. I don't like all this! Karan, you have gone crazy.. Buddy, she is very different. Her sensitivity and sensibility everything is different, Karan! These Hindi film gimmicks, don't make any difference to her, buddy. Thank God he had only written happy birthday. If he had written I love you then.. Then she would have kicked him out of the house. My dear, I have told you so many times that don't fall in love with an A-category girl. Hey, what is this? - Pooja had gifted this to me. Oh! She must have gifted you this for getting angry with you. Hey, bring it here! Open it. - Open it. - Open it. Open it! What is inside this? - Come on! Hey, Karan, a trumpet! There is a letter also along with it. 'My dear Karan, I can never forget you.' 'Because I owe my life to you.' 'You have such a beautiful heart that cares for others.' 'Karan, I know that you are a very good musician' 'but you are not concentrating fully on it.' 'You have to become a big musician in life' 'because every person has a goal.' 'This gift of mine will always make you remember your goal.' Now do you get why she was angry with you and why she scolded you? Buddy, if she can think about you till such an extent then you can imagine how much she must be loving you! Now don't waste time, go and tell her, 'I love you'. Why are you getting scared? Be brave, Karan. By writing this letter to you she has given you the green signal, my dear. Yes. - Karan, all systems indicate a go-ahead. Get on with your love story, be patient. - Come on! Go to her and tell her, 'I love you'. Go, Karan. Hey, you scoundrel! Where are you rushing to on your bike? Can't you see that we have blocked the road? Are you going to attend somebody's marriage with this trumpet? Hey.. He is getting angry as though his beloved has gifted it to him. Here take it, sir! With love from Pooja! Oh! Pooja! Pooja! Oh, my God! Getting angry for such a small thing! No! Pooja, whose letter is it? - Simmi! Simmi! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! You have got admission in Harvard University. Congratulations! I will go and call up father, okay! Yes, call him up but don't tell him. I want to give him a surprise. - Okay! Hi, Pooja! Karan, what timing! You have come at the right time. As soon as I got the good news, you have arrived. I have got admission in Harvard University. I am going back to America. Oh! - Do you know, Karan I was waiting so eagerly for this day to come. I had been studying day and night for this day. Today I am very happy! I can see my destination very clearly. Hey how did you get this wound? Oh! It is because I met with a small accident. It will heal. Karan, I hope you are not angry with me because of yesterday. See it was your fault! Don't do it again, okay? Okay. - My dear, congratulations! - Uncle! I have got admission in Harvard University. Wow, that is lovely! - I am going back to America! Let us dance and shout! Greetings, welcome! Welcome! - Hello! Hey, not to me, go and give it over there. Hello. Hello - What are you doing? Hey, please.. What! Go and speak to her. Welcome! - Congratulations! Congratulations! Hi, Karan! - Hi, Pooja! How are you? Hello, sir. - Pooja! - Hi, how are you? Congratulations! - Thanks. Congratulations. - Thank you. Now congratulate me. For what? - First congratulate me. But why? I have got admission in Harvard University. I am going to America. Karan, Priya is calling you. Priya! What is the matter, why have you called me here? Karan, Pooja is going back to America. Oh! So you have called me to tell me this? Come. You are taking it so easy as though nothing has happened. Oh, come on now. In any case she had to go back. Has Pooja refused? No. Did you tell her that you love her or not? So I will go and tell Pooja right now. No, Priya, please! And you had told me to be friends with her first and after becoming Pooja's friend, I came to know that it was one-sided love. Priya. Pooja is so excited about going to Harvard that I don't want to hurt her by expressing my love to her. I believe that she will be more happy with her choice of life rather than my love for her. If you wanted to be her friend then why did you follow her like a mad man all these days? Do you know, Priya, what is the meaning of true love? To see your beloved happy. And Pooja is my true love. I want to always see Pooja happy. - By hurting yourself! Certainly! I would never want Pooja to know about my love for her. I know that you will also not tell her anything. Promise! Hey, Pankaj, come here. Yes, Uncle. - Go and tell them inside that it is time for the farewell ceremony, be fast. Okay. - And I am going to Priya's in-laws' place along with the truck to drop all the baggage. Okay, Uncle. - Hey, you fools, have you kept all the baggage? Yes, we have counted and kept everything. Well done! Well done! Very good! God bless you, my dear. Be happy. Mother, will you come to meet me? What are you saying, dear? How can we forget you? Where is Karan? Where is Karan? Dear, he must be somewhere around stop worrying about him, it is getting late, you go. How can I leave without meeting him? But, dear.. - Karan! Where are you going, Priya? Priya! - Everybody is waiting for you! Karan! Karan! Karan! Karan.. What are you doing over here? Priya, you are also leaving me? Karan! - Priya! Why is all this happening? Why is it happening with my brother? Priya! Priya! If I had known earlier that all this is going to happen with you then I would have told you to go and express your love to Pooja that very same day. I wouldn't have told you to befriend her. Your state is because of me! Why did I stop you? Why did I stop you! No, Priya! No! Don't say that. You have not done anything. Priya, what had to happen has happened. It is my luck, Priya. Don't cry, Priya, don't cry for me. I am sorry, Priya, I got late. Wish you a very happy married life. Thank you. - Come, dear. Priya, take care of yourself. Father, Pooja has come to take your blessings as she is going to America. Oh! Be happy. God bless you, dear. God bless you, dear. God bless. - Where is sir? He has gone to Priya's in-laws' house to drop her. He will come back tomorrow. Don't worry, I will tell him. Okay, sir. - All the best, dear. - I will make a move. Okay, Karan, I will get going. Don't forget, the flight is at ten tomorrow morning. Bye! - Bye. Son! Karan! Father! - My son! Karan. - Father! No, my son. No, my dear, no. I am proud of you. Pooja! Pooja! Where are you lost? Akash, will you take care of uncle? Of course, Pooja, you don't worry. My dear, what mistake have I made that you have asked me not to come to the airport? I didn't like it, dear. Uncle, it is because you can send me from here by encouraging me. What will happen if you are not able to control yourself over there? I won't be able to control myself if I see tears in your eyes, Uncle. Then maybe I won't be able to go. - Oh, it is fine! I am very brave. I am not so weak, dear, as you are imagining be to be. Come on. Take care, Uncle. You also take care, dear. You are going for a very good cause. I want that when you complete your studies and come back your studies and your research should be beneficial for our country. Okay, Simmi. Pooja! Pooja, don't go. Crazy girl, will you send off your sister crying like this? You are making us cry and then leaving. That fool decided not to express his love and you all didn't say anything! What could we do? He had told us not to say anything. I will see how he stops me! Brother, come on! - Now where are you going? My son's beloved is going away and I shall watch everything silently? I will go and stop her. Even if I have to bow in front of Pooja. Hey, you Romeo, from the ancient era! You still have time, before the flight takes off. You also check in, buddy. I mean, go and tell her that you love her. And if you don't have the courage then we will go and tell her. Yes! - Come on! Dare any of you go and say anything to Pooja. I think she has heard everything. I pray to God she has heard everything. Coffee Here. - Thanks. What are you thinking, Pooja? I am thinking that I refused all my family members and even uncle to come to the airport but I didn't refuse you. Why is that? Very simple. It is because they all are attached to you. And it pains a lot to separate from the one who is attached to you. And us? We are just acquaintances. And it doesn't hurt when separating from such people. Right? - Right. You have learnt to talk a lot these days. Krishna, put the motorcycle on the stand and come fast. Okay. - Come on. Come on. Hey! Hey! Where are you going? I am going inside. - Where is your ticket? My brother is getting the ticket. - You can't enter without a ticket. My brother is getting the ticket, I won't go in without a ticket. Security, get him. Take him away. I am a retired captain. Listen to me. - Get out. Pooja's flight will take off. Allow me to go in. - Come on. Karan, Chiku is crying a lot, we will have to handle him. What happened? - No. No. Nothing. I will be right back. Chiku, what are you doing? - He doesn't understand.. Control yourself. Karan, he wants to tell everything to Pooja. I have told you all so many times that no one will tell Pooja anything. But you still don't get it, do you? Why don't you want to tell her, buddy? Karan, she is your life support. How will you live without the support? Karan, we are your friends, we can't see you leading a suffocating life. You can stop me as much as you can, Karan but I will tell her everything today. Chiku - Stop, Chiku. Have you gone mad? You will see me dead if you take even a single step forward. Karan.. Karan, Pooja is coming here. Say it, Karan. Pooja is coming, wipe your tears. Say it, Karan. - Wipe them fast. What is wrong with Chiku? Why is he crying? No, it's because you are leaving. Yes. Yes. - Oh, Chiku, how sweet. Pooja, would you mind if I say something? Oh, God. - Yes, say it. You won't forget us after going there, will you? How can I forget, you all are Karan's friend. I will cherish each moment spent with you all. Hey, I forgot your autographs. Autograph please. Thank you. Now won't you give me one? - Why? What have I done now? Sometimes even the doer isn't aware of his deeds. Please. Pooja what happened? Karan, I don't know why but I feel as if I am leaving something behind. I have a strange feeling. As the time for my departure is coming closer I feel as if something is going away from me. - 'Air India flight number' '753 to New York is ready for boarding.' 'Passengers are requested to proceed towards the security check.' Okay, Karan, I will make a move. Okay. Bye, Pooja. Take care. Karan! Pooja! What happened, Pooja? I remembered, what I was missing. And even you know what I was missing. You do, don't you? You love me a lot, don't you? I love you, Karan. I love you, Pooja. - I love you. Go, Pooja. Your flight has been announced. No, Karan, I will stay here. Now, I won't leave you and go anywhere. No, Pooja, you will have to go. Did you hear that? You will have to go! We can unite later. But the opportunity that you have got today you will never get the same again. And then you had said that everyone should have an aim in life. Today, because of you, I have an aim in life. Forget waiting for days, months or years I can wait several lifetimes for you. Karan. 'Calling Ms. Pooja Saxena. Ms. Pooja Saxena.' 'Passenger travelling by Air India flight number 753 to New York' 'is requested to board the aircraft immediately.' Go, Pooja.. Our love will help us achieve our goals. Bye. - Bye. Come here, son. Come here. Yes! - Very good. Very good. - Uncle. Father. - Bless you, my son. Bless you. Good that she initiated it or else, you are so naive that you wouldn't have confessed your love all your life. He is still naive that is why he does everything wrong. But this thing that he did was very good. Whose son is he after all! - Wonderful, dear! Now that he has done something good you claim to be his father. And if he does something wrong then.. Then it is because he is your nephew after all! "Your eyes really enchanted me." "Your eyes really enchanted me." "Your eyes really enchanted me." "Your eyes really enchanted me." "I am not the one to be blamed! You had fallen for my beauty!" "I am not the one to be blamed! You had fallen for my beauty!" "You gazed upon me and you stole my heart!" "And took away my soul!" "I am not the one to be blamed! You had fallen for my beauty!" "You gazed upon me and you stole my heart!" "And took away my soul!" "I am not the one to be blamed! You had fallen for my beauty!"
