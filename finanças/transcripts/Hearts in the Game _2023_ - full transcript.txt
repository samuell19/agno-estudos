♪ Hey ya! ♪ ♪ Maybe I'm not typical ♪ ♪ I could be so cynical ♪ ♪ Yeah, I've come from ridicule. ♪ Try to keep this short. You've got back-to-back all day, including Mark Gold. - Mark? - Mmhmm. He wants to do breakfast. Maybe I finally broke through and he's ready to give my new firm a shot. How long do I have here? 20 minutes, tops. I only need 10. Maybe 15. Did you see gossip train? I look like a liar. How will anyone ever remember me, except as the girl that lies about being a vegan. My career is over. Here, take this. Breathe. You didn't do anything wrong. You're a successful young woman. The world is watching. Instead of hiding from middle-aged men with cameras who are waiting for you to feel shame that they created, you need to own this moment. Because if your body told you, you needed a cheeseburger, then you did what all women should do. You listen to your body. Yeah. With over 30 million followers. You have the power to spin this story any way you want, the way it should be seen. Mmhmm. Own it. Maybe brush your hair first. Now repeat after me. Listening to your body, you know, listening to yourself, is the only way that you can become the woman that you're destined to be. You know, it's the only way that you can become the woman that the world needs you to be. Just like my character in Teen Revenge again, which is in theaters tomorrow. Turning a meat-infused night of debauchery into a viral soapbox moment for female empowerment, while simultaneously driving fans to the box office. Can I be you when I grow up? Just wow, [kiss] a classic Hazel spin. Hey, mom and dad. - Hazel, hon, how are you? - Taking over the world today? Absolutely. Hi, Hazel's parents. Jax says hi. - Hi Jax! - Hey! We just wanted to call and say thank you for the surprise cheesecake. It was delicious. Oh, I know how much you loved it when you were here, so... Maybe next time you can hand deliver it. Mom... We really think you should come home, kiddo. We need to make a pit stop. I promised there will be coffee at breakfast with Mark Gold. This isn't about coffee. Dad, I got to run. I love you. I'll call you later. - Love you. - Bye sweetheart. Love you. Fred, we need to head to the West Village. You got it. If I didn't know any better Hazel, I think you wanted to be friends. We are best friends. So, just a seen? Not even a double-tap like, for me. Sometimes less is more. Is it? I write portraits of a person, not flashing moments of a never-ending zeitgeist. She's not my beat. I did not take you for an award-winning journalist who wouldn't want to uplift a young female voice. Hazel... you are better than that argument. The story is already out there. It's just not compelling enough. And plus, I know that that entire video is all your spin, which makes you an exceptional publicist. But it doesn't make her a good story. Biggest news in baseball comes from New York. That's Strike Zone Weekly. Sure is, Freddo. Big announcement today. "Looks like the New York Mets have officially lost their minds "as rumors spread that they are signing pitcher-non-grata, "Diego Vasquez." They want Vasquez. Why? "The league's top pitcher was dropped last season "for freezing on the mound in the 9th inning "of Game Seven of the World Series, "and Vasquez still won't comment on why." I don't know what the Mets are thinking. In our humble baseball opinion, this could be Vasquez's last chance at pitching professionally. Okay, what do I need to do to get an in Do I need to give you my proverbial first child? Or a table at the Met Gala? My rent-controlled apartment? I have told you a million times, but when you have a client with a story that nobody's gotten yet, that nobody can get, the ungettable get at an angle that my readers will salivate over, then I'll do it. But until then, Hazel, you need to stop stalking me at coffee shops. A guy that freezes like that is not New York Mets material. We are a team that cares about tradition, loyalty. But you cannot deny that Vasquez is one of the best pitchers major League Baseball has ever seen. I cannot deny that. Vasquez holds the record for the most no-hitters in baseball history. And that's exactly what our Mets need, Freddo. Yeah, well, I sure hope the Mets know what they're doing, because they're betting the entire franchise on Diego Vasquez. That's the beauty of baseball. The theatrics, the heart, the soul... Baseball, I take it. Always. Hm. Kid, we're getting pressure from the GM to make sure you look good. I don't look good? No, kid, you don't. Look, I understand you had a moment. We all do. Except your moment happened to be during the most important inning of baseball last year. And since you won't give me or the league an explanation - Mark- - No, no, no, no. I'm not even going to try and get the answer out of you anymore 'cause you promised me it wouldn't happen again. The New York Mets Club doesn't really trust you yet. I mean, they definitely need a pitcher, and you're the best pitcher this league has seen in over a decade. But you don't have a team. What are you trying to say, Mark? The Mets won't make it official until we start to see some good press. Okay, but don't worry, I've got it handled. How? What? We can't- But Mark- Let's reschedule. I have a... I'm feeling a little pressure in my sinuses. So, we're gonna reschedule. And you know what? It's gonna be great, because Martin loves me. It'll be fine. Alright. I've never seen you so shaky. I'd assume it's an ex, but I control your schedule and know you're all work no play, so... No! Jax. Diego Vasquez! The new Met? The new what? Met, as in the New York Mets. Oh, Fred is going to freak. I can't- Word broke this morning that they're signing him or thinking about it. While most fans, unlike myself, doubt whether he could be loyal to the franchise. There are fans like myself that lead with empathy and think a second chance should always be given. Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow! Mark Gold! He did say this meeting was with one of his sports clients. Hazel? Is Diego Vasquez, your new spin. Hazel, this is huge. This cannot be happening. Hazel, you know I'm not one to overstep, but Diego Vasquez would be a huge get. He hasn't talked to the press since- We are avoiding all things... all things Diego Vasquez. Oh. Hazel Lynn Miller. Do you know Diego Vasquez? Have you been holding out on me. Overstepping? Jax? Girl. Come on. We went to high school together. Okay, I will do this meeting out of respect for Mark, but that is it. Okay, let's get this over with. Here comes our safety net now. Diego, this is... Hazel Miller. Oh, I see her reputation precedes itself. Yeah, you could say that. Mr. Vasquez, it's so nice to see you again. I am so thrilled you came to me for help. Hmm. So you spin stories now... for a living. That's... that's fitting. Mark, I apologize, but I don't think my firm is the right fit this time. So, I will call you with another recommendation, should anyone bite. - No, no. Wait, wait, wait. - Thank you, Mark. They went to high school together? Hazel... It is not worth it. Mark will call again. Will he? Mark Gold has access to every major athlete on the East Coast. His roster alone makes the choice to go out on your own the right one. If you get it, you'll officially be the queen bee of the PR game. You need it, and this is your chance to get it. It's absolutely worth it. I cannot work with Diego. There has got to be a better option. No, this is it. Hazel Miller is one of the best publicists on the East Coast, maybe the country. I've seen her change the court of public opinion with one single post. Alright? I'm not some social life-gram influencer, okay? I'm a serious athlete. I have a career. Uh, no, you don't, actually. Diego, no one will sign you. Not unless she helps spin the story. Every news and media outlet in this country has been dying to get an exclusive with Diego Vasquez. He hasn't done any press since... The incident. Diego Vasquez, top pitcher, froze on the mound during Game Seven of the World Series, leaving his team with a big I and no one knows why. He's the anti-hero for all of Major League baseball. Villainized by every media outlet. But with the right spin, the Hazel spin, he can be back in action. You could change the fate of baseball, the fate of the New York Mets. And as a die-hard Mets fan, I could tell you that if we ever want to win, the New York Mets must commit to Diego Vasquez. You must commit to Diego Vasquez. If you ever want to throw a baseball again, you're going to have to suck it up. Whatever happened between you guys back when you were younger versions of yourself doesn't matter now, Do you want to pitch again? Or do you want to choke on your own pride and be remembered as the guy that walked away? You want that to be your legacy? I want to pitch again. You want pitch again? Right there. Diego is like... an ungettable get. Wait, what did you just say? An ungettable get. Especially if you can get him to give up the goods on Game Seven. I would excuse myself, but I don't want to. Hazel. - Hi. - Diego. Jax. My assistant. If I choose to do this, it's not for you. It's for me. My career. Okay. Know that. Okay. Tell Mark I'll be in touch with my decision. Bye. It is an honor. - Jax. - Yeah. Oh, man. And? And she said she'll think about it. Of course, she will. I have it. The ungettable get. The story everyone wants, but no one can have... Diego Vasquez. How in the world are you going to get Diego Vasquez? He doesn't do press. Believe me, I tried. And I don't try. To use your words, I'm exceptional, remember? Okay, and what's the angle? Hometown hero rises from the ashes. How a boy became a man on the pitcher's mound. The only way the profile works is if he admits why he froze. So I want the full story. And I want to do the interview in his hometown. Won't be a problem. Mark. I'm calling with good news. Hazel, you're really just a suburban girl making it in the city. It would appear that way, wouldn't it? I mean, your house has a porch. I can't believe I gave Morgan a spin that brought me back here. You mean a spin that brought you and your high school sweetheart back to the city you found in lost loving. Oh... so you figured that out, huh? The Internet did exist when you were in high school, even though it was ages ago. Rude! Plus, you've been rattled ever since you saw him. And you never get rattled. I get it, though. The sparkly eyes, makes it tough to see clearly. That swing is where I had my first kiss. Where he kissed me for the first time. That tough of a breakup to keep you away, huh. Well, it wasn't just him. Pam, they're here. Hi! Hey, Jax. Welcome back city slicker. - So good to be home! - You too! So, Jax, tell me what miracle brought my girl home? That miracle would be Diego Vasquez. You know what? I'm going to go for a run before my meeting. Okay. 'Cause the meeting is with Diego. The kid who used to live here turned out to be a pretty okay pitcher. Yo, Carlos. Happy to see you, mijo. Me too. Get up here. Me too. So... Hazel. Hazel. I knew she'd be back. Come on, let's get you settled. I'll take that. The house looks good, Tío. Thank you. I know you said I could pack it up, but I didn't want to do anything without you. - Smells good. - Mmhmm. Your mama's recipe. Thought it'd be nice for you since this kitchen is never used. Feels like she's still here. You want to help stuff some tortillas? - Yeah. - Come on. You're still cooking? Yeah. Helps me feel calm when I'm feeling... But I haven't made these in a long time. Feels good, no? - Yeah. - Like home. You know it. How are you feeling, mijo? You know what I mean. Being back here with her. Um... I don't know. Feels surreal. Hazel insisted that I meet her down at the diner, our diner, to talk strategy. Wow. And they want to do the photo shoot down at the baseball diamond. Oh, I know. Hazel's persistence hasn't changed a bit. Not at all. She's really sure of herself now. I mean, she's still so impressive, you know. I mean, she's supposedly turning my career around, which I thought was impossible, but she's really doing it. I know it's her job, but I... I can't stop thinking about that night and how she had no idea why and how I should have- You need to forgive yourself, mijo. Because if you can't, how can she? They were as in love as you can be when you're a teenager. And then he broke up with her. - Uh-huh. - On prom. - No. - Yeah. Yeah. Diego was her world. Too much so. So after the breakup- She dated here and there in college, but nothing ever worked out because- No one was him. So tragically romantic. - So she focused on her career. - Mmhmm. And built walls so she wouldn't break again. Classic arc. Sweetie. - Hi. - Hi. Hope you're not talking about me. I would never. - Hello. - Hey. Look, let's just agree to play nice. We're on the same team. I'm here to help. Here's what I'm thinking. You don't do social media. Ironically, in our case, that's a good thing. It means we can control the narrative, guide the story to highlight what makes you worthy, needed, lovable. As you know, Morgan Lucas is an award-winning journalist. But what you might not know is that she is from a small town in Michigan. She doesn't talk about it much, but she really cares about her Midwest roots, which is something the two of you have in common. So, basically, we're going to lead her away from anything that villainizes you further. Because right now, you're the one to hate. The one who ruined a team's chance of becoming champions. So we need to humanize you. Show you for your wholesome roots. Show you as the boy who became a man on the pitcher's mound. Now, Morgan's going to start easy. She's going to ask you how you got into baseball. And you'll say... My grandfather. Just a little more. Yeah, um, and my grandfather taught my Tío. Coach Carlos. He saved me senior year, passed me in Phys-Ed when he definitely should not have. And he's been so... Back on track. So your grandfather... He really loved the game. And he taught my Tío and my mom. And she, um... She uh... I never got to say, you know, I never got to say in person how sorry I was to hear about Angela. She was such a special person. Um... so, what's next? The biggest talking point is going to be Game Seven. You and I can craft some sort of a sympathetic reason as to why you froze on the ground- No! I don't... I don't want to. - Diego, it's time for you to- - No. - Talk about- - Talk about... no. Wait. Are you... are you leaving? Diego?! Hey! Diego! Diego, wait, stop! It's just me and you. Good. - Hey. Are you okay? - Yup. Hey. Diego... Diego. Just tap it down. Tap, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Tap but not- Look at getting their hands dirty. Oh, yeah. Jax is a natural. Two green thumbs. I'm fully committed to this whole small town vibe. So, how did it go with Diego? Oh, uh... Are you okay? He won't even try. Your lack of dialogue is scaring me. Not to overstep... again, but I think he's more sensitive than you think. Sometimes the toughest ones are the most breakable. I come in peace-izza. Can I come in? This is pepperoni and mushroom from Dominelli's Still your favorite, right? Yeah. Thank you. This house hasn't changed a bit. Look. Do you still have that record collection? Yeah. Oh, I am so glad you kept these. Your mom always had the best vinyl. Specifically jazz. She'd laugh if she knew what was going on now. She always wanted to know everything that was going on, remember? Which you'd actually tell her. I tried to hide everything from my parents, but you never did. It was really great, actually, looking back. You guys were so close. I always admired that. Is there something that you wanted to talk about, Hazel? Okay. Listen, this is clearly an uncomfortable situation, but it is happening. So, at the end of the day, no matter what happened a million years ago, you are now my client. And I care about my clients. I work hard for my clients. I make miracles happen for my clients. Which means I am going to make miracles happen for you. Because for me, work comes first. No matter what, aways will. I promised myself a long time ago that I wouldn't let someone else be my validation. All this to say you come first. As long as we are working together. - Diego, you can trust me. - Ok. You know, Hazel, you turned out really different than I thought you would. Everything is different. Well, not everything. Oh! - Still good? - Oh, so good. This is for both of us. Morgan Lucas wants to meet up later after she checks in. Okay. Jax will send you all the info. Oh... Wear something that says, you know, you want to love me. Your mom was really amazing. I loved her. Oh, really good. Text me! Thanks for leaving me a slice! Hey. So does this make you want to love me? Morgan! Hey. Welcome to Ohio. Thank you, Hazel. I missed the Midwest more than I thought I did. Morgan Lucas. Diego Vasquez. - Pleasure to meet you. - Likewise. I am really looking forward to what you have to say today. - Yeah. - Shall we? Yeah. - After you. - Thank you. Are you sure you want chocolate? They're actually known for... I am always sure about chocolate. She wants what she wants. FYI he can be a little slow to warm, so I say keep tonight fun, go deeper later. Ok. - One chocolate for you. - Oh, thank you. Thank you. Made best friends back there. Oh, yeah, he was uh... Sorry. I'd love to record this, if you're okay with that. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's why we're here. Come on, there's a table over... Okay. Oh, and ready to record. Mm. So good. Okay. You said he was... Yeah, he was actually from a town near where my family is from. Mmhmm. He thought I might have been born there. Where were you born? Texas. Yeah, and we moved here to Ohio. I grew up here until I moved to a farm team for Chicago. I love us Midwesterners. We always end up in the city. You are from Ohio, too, right, Hazel? - Mmhmm. - Mmhmm. Yeah, we're both from here. Oh. I didn't realize you two knew each other. Mmhmm. Oh, not super well. We just went to the same high school. Diego was a legend. Total hometown hero. Everyone thought he was going to do big things, and he did. We all followed his career pretty religiously. Even me. So, let's start from the beginning. How did you get into baseball? My grandfather. He could have gone pro if he'd been in the States. He just really loved the game. And he taught me to love it, too. Thanks for making the interview happen here. I just think there's something so interesting about how your childhood molded you into who you are. Anyway, we'll see you both tomorrow. - Night. - Bye, Morgan. Good night. Great job. Yeah. You think? Yeah. Um... I can walk you home. Oh, no, you don't have to. It's alright, so close. Oh, no. I know. Yeah. Okay. Why did you lie to Morgan? When did I lie? You said we didn't really know each other. Well, we need to keep her focused on you, not some uncomfortable nostalgia. Plus, I didn't really lie. We didn't know each other. Not really, anyway. Thank you for walking me home. Yeah, no. - You did not have to do that. - I wanted to. So... why haven't you come back? Every summer in college, I hustled to get internships at top PR firms. And then when I graduated, I got a job at a pretty prestigious one. It was a job like a million people were gunning for, so couldn't give up that opportunity to come home and visit people. How about now? Now I fly my parents to the city all the time. It's really fun having them in my world. What about you? Well, Carlos is still here, so he takes care of my mom's house. And I try to see him as much as I can, but usually that involves me flying him out to games. - You're busy. - You're busy. We're both busy. Yeah. - So, uh... - I'll have Jax... - You go. - No, you first. Okay. I'll have Jax send you all the details. - Okay, sounds good. - Ok. - Good night. - Good night. Morgan and her photog are going to be a few behind, but it looks like Diego beat us. He's on the field. How do I find the field? I'll find the field. Rather, I'll find someone to find the field for us. Jax, I know where the field is. Of course you do, obvi. You went here. So tell me, were you a Gretchen or a Regina? I was a Janice myself, except I wore a lot of pink. I would not have thought that. Head to toe. Head to toe. I feel like I'm in a John Hughes movie. This is beyond picturesque. Hazel! Coach Carlos. So good to see you. Mija, it's been too long. Thank you so much for setting this up. You saved me a lot of red tape. Did I have a choice? Absolutely not. This is surreal, huh. Hazel? Uh... is this good for the photo shoot or? Yeah, good. It is more than good, sparkly eyes. What did Jax's call me? Sparkly eyes. Jax thinks your eyes sparkle. Oh! Really? Oh, Morgan's here. She wants to start with a portrait. Good, good. Photo shoot. Let's do it. Does it feel different? Yeah. It does and um... it doesn't. There's great light here. Let's start with some shots of the mound. Those look great. Carlos, he's a trip, by the way. He said that you really loved Phys Ed, Hazel. Did he? Well, I'll make sure to tell him that I run marathons now. Mm? Should we get started? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's get started. Hey, is everything okay? It's just looking really fraught. Not the guy I met last night. Hey, maybe try smiling. Yeah, I'm smiling. Mmhmm. Okay. Maybe you can try loosening him up or something. Yeah, I'll go talk to him. I believe in you, Hazel. - Hey. - Looking all right. Let's do something to loosen you up. Like? Teach me how to throw a fastball. Be the pitching coach I never wanted. Come on. - Right. - Okay. Ready? Got to stretch. Okay. Get serious. Look this way. Check it out. - That was not great. - Not bad. All right. So teach me, Coach. Show me how to do it. Do you want to throw a four seam or a two seam? Literally have no idea what you're talking about. There are different grip. Let's just throw a four seam. It's a classic. And I learned it right here on this mound, actually. - Oh. - Yeah. Okay, so that's for you. You take your pointer finger and your middle finger about an inch apart on the seams. Yeah, like that. And then you rotate the ball like that. And then throw it straight. No spin. - But I love a spin. - Yeah. A pun. All right, give it a shot. Very serious. - Hey. - Okay. - That was still terrible. - Pretty bad. Yeah. But we can get you up to speed, yeah. After a few days at camp. Camp? Baseball camp. I am involved with this charity for kids with cancer. That's amazing. Hazel. Hazel. Yes. Hi. So keep it up, Coach. Yeah, I'll uh... That should do it. What? I didn't say anything. Thanks, man. ♪ I woke to find the frost across my window. ♪ You seem comfortable here. Yeah. I haven't been back in a while, but home always feels like home, you know? - Ready? - Mmhmm. Ready. Well, I guess I could have held my breath. Karlee. Hi Hazel. How are you? Good. Hi. I'm Jax. Hazel's assistant. Yes. We went to school together. Fun. Mmhmm. Oh, thank you. I tried to call. - I know. - Hi. Hello is she...? This is my daughter, Brett. Hi, Brett. Hi. She looks just like you. Sorry, babe. She's so fast. No way! Hazel. Hi, Chris. Oh, my gosh! So good to see you. Oh, you too. Karlee. Hazel. Walk me through your mindset in Game Seven. - What made you- - No. I'm sorry. That's... that's off-limits. Hazel knows... that. No. Diego? Chris! Come here, man! What are you...? - Good to see you. - Look at this guy. I haven't seen you for so long. You're both here. Are you guys back...? No. Hudson and Park Magazine is doing a piece on Diego. I'm the publicist. Hudson and Park. Wow, that's impressive. Karlee here is a writer. Hi, Morgan. Hi. - I'm the journalist. - Oh. So, how long are you here, dude? We're leaving tomorrow. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, perfect. We're having a party tonight because the weather finally got good. Our house. 407 Grove. You guys got to come. What else are you going to do on a Friday night? Nothing. Kids going to be with my folks. We are going to rage. You have to come. Uh... You have to come. Yeah. Yeah, Hazel. Rage. I mean... Oh, this is going to be so good. Just like old times. Everyone is going to be there. When they see you guys... they're going to flip. Wow, that's... I mean. Right? I'm doing a portrait of Diego and how the town made him who he is. I'd love to come. Maybe interview a few of you. Yes, of course. We would be more than happy to embarrass Diego. - Karlee... - Thank you. I don't have to come. No. You should. Okay. - I'll see you, bro. - Alright. See you tonight, Haze. I'll see you, too. Okay. It's gonna be just like old times. Yeah. See you guys tonight. - Okay. - Yeah. Everyone is going to be there, so. Did you want me to swing by and pick you up? We can walk together or if that's too- No, no... yeah. Yeah? No. Yes. That totally works. Okay. I'll see you... see you later then. See you tonight. See ya. See ya. Hazel, we need to talk. Diego will not open up about Game Seven. This... this is a problem. I'll handle it. You will get that story one way or another. You have my word. Okay. Have you ever had a friend break up? Karlee, I'm guessing? Yep. I chose work in Paris over her wedding. Most important day of her life. I mean, it is Paris. Thank you for trying. Hey. Come in, Mom. You look nice. Oh, thank you. Party at Karlee's. That'll be fun. Yeah. I'm happy you're patching things up with her. Honestly, I think she was just being polite. Because if Diego hadn't been there- Then you wouldn't be here. Touché. Okay. Which one? Oh, that one. Do you want to patch things up with her? Yeah, I really do. I just hope she can understand how much she was asking me to give up. My boss would have fired me, but I know how much I hurt her. And I so wish I could have been there for her. I don't know if I could go back and handle it all differently. I'm not sure I would. I made the right choice for what I wanted. I understand. You know, I find the older you get, the more empathy and clarity you have for those that you love. You've both lived a lot of life since then. Maybe you've had enough time to see the other person's side of the story. Maybe. I hope. Think about it. I'll let you finish getting ready. Okay. Hon... I just have to say it. I think you put a lot of pressure on yourself to be perfect. Just know we don't want you to be anything but who you are. You're amazing the way you are. Thank you, mom. You know, he never wanted you to be anything but you, either. I just don't think she has the dramatic personality to be a housewife. I couldn't agree more, Mr. Miller. Oh, honey, you look fabulous. Oh, beautiful. Ten out of ten. Hometown chic on fleek. I changed. I'll get it. A boy is picking you up from my house. I will get the door. It's not like that, dad? Sure it's not? Oh. Diego! Oh, come on in. Mr. Miller. It's been a while. Good to see you. Oh, man it has. Good to see you, too. - Diego. Honey. - Mrs. Miller. Oh, you are just as handsome as ever. These are for you. Oh! And just as smart. Should we go? Morgan's probably already on her way. Oh, right. Yeah, we should probably head out. But it's great seeing you both. Have way too much fun. And text me if you want me to pick you up. We can even go through a drive-through. Okay. Good night. This is kind of weird, huh? Beyond weird. You ready? Yeah. - Hey. - Hey. I'm just going to grab a couple more quotes and observe for a little bit longer, then I got to head out. Everybody really loves that guy. Like, genuinely. It's completely refreshing. Hm. Did you know he heads the Board to a pediatric cancer charity? And he actually volunteers, not just gives money. And he paid to renovate the baseball field. That was supposed to be anonymous. But that guy's wife's on the PTA and she's going to keep quiet. Yeah, and she said that you two were pretty hot and heavy in high school. That's not relevant to the story. You see, that's where I disagree. Because the story is about how the town made the man. And it sounds like you had a pretty instrumental part in that. I didn't. Trust me. Any news on Game Seven? Not yet, but you will get it. Okay, well, I need to turn the draft in for my flight, so tomorrow morning, the diner, Hazel. Okay. Okay. Hey. Hi. Am I crazy or did there used to be a wall here? You're not crazy. We watch a lot of home renovation shows. Well, it looks incredible. So do these cookies. Did you happen to save- Save some cookie dough? Do I have a soul? Hazel, would you like to break into the secret cookie dough stash? I would love nothing more. So you live here? I do. And I teach at Northside. English teacher. How did that happen? Are you still writing? Well, with teaching and a five-year old, it doesn't really leave time for anything. You could still find time to write if you wanted to, right? Maybe you just need to find the right story. Maybe. You feel right in this house. I tried to leave for so long, it's funny. Never did. You, Hazel, you really made it happen. The life that you always talked about. The life you made for yourself. The career that you made for yourself. Hey, um... I'm really sorry I didn't come to your wedding. It's the most important day of your life, and I was so focused on... No, I'm sorry. It isn't black and white and I made it that way. Weddings make you crazy. I think about it all the time. That I shouldn't have cut you out like that. No, I should have been there for you and I wasn't. And I know it hurt you and I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I missed you. I missed you, too. Whoa. We're just catching up. It really is a seller's market. Everybody thought they wanted to be in the city, buying everything up. It's like your old place, Diego. Rehab project is all a rage here. You should actually think about selling your mom's spot. Even if it is a tear-down. The land alone is major. I mean, I could probably get it off your hand in like a day. Did I tell you guys that Karlee roped me into- What? It's true. She roped me into chaperoning the prom later next week. And I mean, I had a good time at the prom, but not enough to go back. Am I right? Am I right, Haze? I'm going to get some water. - Chris? - What? What did I say? - Think about it. - Oh, I'm a moron. You stay. I got this. Alright. Thanks. So, Diego, what kind of free swag do you get? Dude. I'm a grown woman. I should not still be upset that I didn't go to prom. It's pathetic. I blame nostalgia. Well, to be honest, it was a let-down. The food stunk and the punch was mediocre. I am so glad you don't still hate me. Don't be stupid. I love you. I love you. Oh! This song! I love this song! This is nice. Just like old times. Yeah. - You been okay. - Yeah. Well, look, I just gotta say it, man. I think you two really work. I mean, you've always worked. Like, I saw those pictures of you and those models and actresses in the tabloids and you were never really smiling. And I hate to break it to you, buddy, but tonight you've been doing an awful lot of smiling. I just think you two could work. ♪ ...I saw the signs, it opened up my eyes... ♪ We should probably- Oh, yeah. This will be fun. Hello? Thank you. ♪ Come tomorrow I'll be missing you. ♪ ♪ 'Cause you'll be so far away. ♪ You want to get outta here? ♪ I won't be kissing you... ♪ ♪ I'll be on my way. ♪ Guys, goodnight. We'll see you in the morning. ♪ I have to say I love you to myself... ♪ So things seem really good with Karlee. Yeah, I think we're in the strike zone. That's a baseball term. Now that I'm basically a professional, I'm going to be using them all the time. - Oh, really? - Yes. Like what? Bullpen? Grand slam? RBI? Don't know what it means, but it means but we use it all the time. Wow. So now we know that your baseball terminology is better than your pitching. That's good. I was trying to keep the focus on you. Thank you very much. I can play. I can play. Sure. I can. I'm actually really good. Okay. - Seriously? - Really? Yes. Okay. I have an idea. Hm. I am suspect, but intrigued. It's too bad the gate's locked. You jumped the gate before. I'm not jumping the gate. I am in skinny jeans. Unless those skinny jeans are an excuse. I got a better idea. All right. Just uh... You can do it. Yeah. No, I got this. Do not help me. Not unless you ask me to, no. Okay. It's a process I'm getting- Oh, great, security. Oh. Diego, I'm stuck. Okay. I'm not helping unless you consent. Consent! Consent! Hey! Ball field is closed. There we go. Sorry. Sorry, sorry. Holy moly. You're Diego Vasquez. Hi. Wow. You're the best, man. Hey, that no-hitter against the Padres last season, the best! Thanks, bro. Listen, sorry. We were just trying to get a couple of pitches in for old-time's sake. Yeah, yeah, of course. No problem, man. Yeah. All right. Just so you know, the gate on the right is open, so you can just walk right on through. What? It is? I didn't know. Oh... Wow, uh... Hey, man, can I grab a selfie real quick? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on. Snap away. Tag me in it. Okay. Alright. One, two... All right, man. Hey, thank you so much, man. I really appreciate it. - You have a good night. - Thank you. You too. - You are in so much trouble. - I had no idea. In so much trouble. Oh, it just opens like that? Seriously? - I didn't know. - What? All right, let's go play baseball. Come on. Get you warmed up. Well... did... Bet I could hit one off you. Hazel, come on. Scared I'm going to embarrass you in front of all these people? Sounds like a challenge. Come. I am not swinging unless it's a real pitch. Ok. Did you see that? How? Well, I don't want to brag, but my Central Park softball team are the reigning champions, and I may go to the batting cages every time I want to scream. Okay. I can tell. Hey. What happened? Why did you freeze? I had a panic attack. I always get them on the anniversary of my mom's death. I wasn't told that I would be pitching that night till the morning of. I thought I'd be fine. I hadn't had any issues in a while. Then um... I saw this mom and her kid behind home plate. And the mom looked so much like my mom. I lost it. I... I froze. I don't know for how long before Coach came in to take me out of the game. I should have told Mark and opened up about it. It's just... My mom meant so much to me, and we were this really great team. I just never been able to talk about her death. I don't know what it's like to lose someone like that. But what I do know is how much you loved her. I think that's why this hurts so much. You had so much more love to give her. And really that's a beautiful thing. And it's strong because you are. But talking about it, that makes you strong. None of this makes you weak. None of it. It's what makes you a man. I found out I was losing her, and then I lost you. And then all I had was baseball. And now that's gone. Baseball isn't gone. Hey. I'm sitting right here. I want to show you something. I've never been able to go back in here since the night that she... and I want to pack it up. I really do. I've tried. It's just... I can't. Um... I need to tell you something about that night. It doesn't matter? It was a long time ago. Just let me get it out. The night of prom was the same night that I found out my mom was sick. It was already really advanced. She didn't want me knowing until after. But I saw some papers from the hospital and I should have told you, Hazel. But I couldn't. I didn't know how to let you see me that way. You were there, ready, in that amazing gold dress. And like I broke you. I've never regretted anything more in my entire life. Thank you for telling me. I am so sorry I made you feel like you couldn't. ♪ Oh, restless night. ♪ ♪ Please sing to me. ♪ ♪ I'll be awake ♪ ♪ when the morning breaks the sea ♪ ♪ I feel it all ♪ ♪ when sunrise comes ♪ ♪ when I reach for you ♪ ♪ and I know that you'll be gone ♪ ♪ you're always feigning in love ♪ I can't believe you've done this for me. Hazel... I missed you more than I ever knew I could. Me too. Not too old for fun. We raged! So loud. So much fun. You want some food? It's Mark... I'll take the call. Okay. I will be right back. Can you get me a coffee? - Yes. - Thank you. Cutting it pretty close, Hazel. But I have about an hour to get the article in. Morgan, I was thinking... - Do you have the story? - No. I think we have another exciting spin. We can- No, no, no. The article doesn't work without Game Seven. I'm sure there's another way we can- No. He needs this article. And without his story, the article is dead. Why is the article dead? Hazel? Why is the article dead? Unless you talk about why you frozen in Game Seven, the article is a no go. That was the angle from the beginning. Diego? Diego, wait, wait. Let's... let's talk about this. As my publicist or as my... As your what? Your career really does come first, huh? You're pretty clear about that. You sold me out. No, I didn't. Did you tell Morgan that she'd get the story about Game Seven? Well, Morgan thinks there's no story without it. That's not what I asked. Did you tell Morgan she'd get the story even after I said it was off the table? Yes. But I wasn't going to tell her. I told you everything. I showed you everything. And you just- Was yesterday just an... just an act? No. To get the story what you wanted? No. No. Mark hired me so that I could change your reputation. So you could play again. So I was just going to read my deepest secret as a headline? No. How are you going to spin that, Hazel? You know what? Tell Morgan whatever you need to tell her. Spin the story whichever way you want. Because you always do that. Morgan. Bye. Diego... Hey. Hazel. Are you okay? I know that there's a lot going on, but I think- No, you don't have any idea what's going on. You don't understand how it works. Oh, and why is that? Go ahead, say it, Hazel. I know you want to. The stakes are higher for me, Karlee. You think about how I got out of here. And you? Well, I got the chance to go to New York and create this amazing career and life for myself. And you think that your life is so great because you've crafted this story for yourself? Big city hotshot with a chic wardrobe. Your only friend is your assistant, and the only real relationship you've ever had was in high school. And you won't even fight for that one... again. Look, I may not have gotten to live out the dream I had when I was 16, but dreams change. I have a beautiful family that loves me and a job that is fulfilling every day. I live in reality. I don't live in this fake story like you do. Karlee, that's not- I feel like I missed more than I should have. I think I really messed this up. From what I heard, you absolutely one-hundo P may have messed this up. But if anyone can fix this, you can. You can fix anything. Just think about the right way to spin it. Or not spin it. My metaphor is off, but it sounds good, so let's just go with that, okay? How would you feel if I did the right thing but that may bankrupt my new business, which means you may have to look for a new job, and the New York Mets may never win again. If it means your happiness. I would literally love nothing more in the world, Hazel. Even over the Mets? Even over the Mets, which is hard. You got this. You've always got this. Okay. Let's go ruin my career. Okay. Morgan... I apologize, but I am unable to give you the information you want. Well, my editor wants answers, and I can't keep this quiet, Hazel, Feel free to serve me up. Word will get out, Hazel, and your business may not survive. I know. Are you sure you want to do this? Because, you know, above anybody else, being a woman in a competitive field, the job comes first... always. Otherwise, you can be knocked out of the running like that. Are you really sure that you want to knock yourself out of the running? I am sure. Okay. For what it's worth, I really respect you, Hazel, for putting your client first. Mark. Hello. I have some not so good news. So you want to talk about it? Okay. I'll wait, mijo. She sold me out. This whole thing was an act so that she could get what she wanted. I don't know, mijo. Hazel was always a bad actress. Remember when she was in that musical? Ooof! Listen to me. I know a lot of years have gone by, but Hazel always wanted what was best for you. Your mom always said, Hazel will keep you on your toes, push you to open up, be a better man. I think you should talk to her. Tío, she wanted me to tell the whole world about the worst moment of my life. And what would be so bad about that. Mark. What? What, what, do you mean the article's dead? She killed the article. Yeah, well, hopefully the Mets will still consider me, but I don't know what she was thinking. Yeah, I'll talk to you later. Articles dead. Tío! The article is dead! The article's dead. I gotta go! Hey, I know I've called like a trillion times already, but I just want to say I'm sorry again. I was wrong. I was so wrong about everything. Please call me back. I need you in my life. You are my... you're my best friend and I love you. Honey... I know you're an adult, but as your mom, I need to say something. You're so strong and so driven, and we are so proud of you. But you deserve even more than what you have, what you can give yourself. I don't think Diego is ever going to talk to me again. I did the right thing, right? Like, I didn't throw away my entire career for nothing, right? Thanks for coming. What can I do for you, Diego? I have about 20 minutes to catch my flight. Game Seven of the World Series happened on the same day of the 15-year anniversary of my mom's death. And the bottom of the 9th, I suffered a massive panic attack. Um... are you sure you want to do this? This can be a pretty difficult thing to work through. And I'll never make sense of losing my mom. But I also don't want to lose someone else. Someone who taught me that feeling my pain doesn't make me weak. So I'm going to start this story earlier on the night that I walked out on the love of my life. Yeah. Hazel. I texted and DM'd you like a million times. I turned my phone off. I decided I am never leaving this apartment again. Even though I can't afford it anymore? Do you still love me even though I'm not your boss? I really wish you hadn't gone on a comms cleanse today. Morgan sent this over a little earlier. It's coming out tomorrow. Oh, no. I ruined everything. I won state for oratory and speech and debate, so you're welcome in advance. "When infamous pitcher Diego Vasquez was barely 18 years old, "his mother was diagnosed with aggressive stage four "pancreatic cancer." Oh, God. "His single mom, Angela Vasquez, "immigrated to the United States at 13. "She got here and didn't speak English, "but she made a life for herself, for us. "I never knew how much I didn't have "because everything felt so full with her." Quote like Diego said a quote about his mom? I'll skip to the end. Shall we? Yes. "Diego Vasquez looked at me and spoke quietly. "Last night, I finally told someone my story. "And when she listened, I felt lighter. "Like the weight of my anger and sadness lifted a bit. "She told me that talking about my pain made me strong. "So I thought it was time to bulk up even more. "Even if it's the scariest thing I've ever done. "Because if I don't, who will? "I looked at Mr. Vasquez and couldn't help but think "there was absolutely no spin on this fastball." You think he's talking about me? Oh, he's definitely talking about you, Hazel. Got all your sappy voicemails, and I decided that I couldn't let you run away again. You're my best friend and I love you, too. I smell like food and tears. I'm used to it. I have a child. I have to find him. He's with Chris back home. Oh. He's been hanging out with us a lot. Why don't we get you packed and showered and maybe bring a dress. Thank you. You guys got me. I cannot believe you roped me into this. Blame Karlee. She signed us up for two chaperone spots, and she had to go out of town. The kids are freaking out. You know you're super famous. Oh, yeah. Hey, hey, hey! Dude, I'm hungry. Hey! Shh. Hi. Hey. Diego... After you broke up with me, I promised myself that I would never be hurt like that again. I built this wall of sarcasm and stories and bravado around my heart. But when I read that article, I saw how brave you are, so I knew I had to be brave, too. You thought you broke me, but I think you cracked me open and open to let you in. Open to love you. There has never been anyone else but you, Hazel. Will you go to the prom with me? - Well, yeah. - Yeah. Now we just got to work on your fastball. Yeah. No spin. You love a spin, come on. Not now, Mark. ♪ Listen to your heart... ♪ ♪ When he's calling for you ♪ It's Mark. Hi, Mark. Mr. Vasquez. What a comeback. A no-hitter in your first professional game back. How do you feel? I feel great. Yeah, I feel really great. It's been quite the year for you since opening up about your mental health struggles in such a public way. Yeah, a lot to unpack, but I'm better for it. My pitching is better for it. No way to spin that. And how are you liking New York? It feels like home. It really does. You better get ready. You're about to be so busy, you're going to wish you weren't so good. Cannot wait. Okay, your publicity call with the publisher is in ten minutes. The book is officially a bestseller. This author is hot. There was never any doubt. Karlee, it's official. You're a best-selling author. We have been fielding all kinds of interview requests, including Morgan Lucas, who wants you on her new podcast. Don't be nervous. You're a mom. You gave birth. You can do anything. Plus, you're my client. I will be with you every step of the way. - Hey, babe. - Hey. Look, I got to run. Talk soon. Love you. - Hi. - Hi. Oh, my goodness. I am never going to get used to this. Or someone cooking in my kitchen. Well, get used to me cooking in your kitchen for the rest of our lives, mi amore. At least in the off-season.
