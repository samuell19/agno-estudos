On the banks of Edo is the Terajima Flower Garden. In every season, despite being far away, refined people visit it to appreciate the flowers in spring, the moon in summer and the seven plants in autumn. Hagi (lespedeza), kikyo (bell), obana (iris), kuzu (kudzu), nadeshiko (carnation), ominaeshi (patrinia), fujibakama (eupatorium). In this flower garden, there is something hidden. THE FLOWER FLUTE MURDERS 15th of the eighth month of the old calendar, 1810. It all started on the evening of the full autumn moon. Do you want me to leave? You were at Mr. Bishu's party, were you not? And you only left for a moment. That customer does not matter. I heard they are going out on a boat to watch the moon while drinking sake. I do not care about that. Your obi is loose. What? I am joking. Hey! The ornament is about to fall. I am not going to fall for that anymore. I told you. You are evil. It does not matter if I tell you the truth, you get angry either way. The thing is... Miss Koen. Yes? Come in. I am sorry to bother you, but... Miss, Miss Tsurukichi calls you. Me? Yes. She is leaving by boat with the lord of the Yamashiroya, and has something to discuss with you. What would it be? Wait for me, okay? Do not go. It was bad to fall in love with the most popular Yanagibashi. They request you everywhere. You are saying those evil things again. Come in, come in, sir. I know, I know. Tonight I will be alone with Tsurukichi. Come quickly. Enjoy it. See you, Koen. Tsurukichi, come here quickly. Murder! Help! Someone help me! Murder! Help! There is a dead man! Please, help! Oh! Mr. Aoe! Call the watchman. Y-yes. And the murderer? I-it was a ronin with a white hood. A white hood? He came rowing a boat. I saw something shiny go by and... that cut Tsurukichi's throat. Eh? There, it is in there. Koen. Good thing it was not you. What? When I heard the screams I ran at full speed thinking it could be you. Was it Miss Tsurukichi...? Yes. Eh? Oh, this... Miss Tsurukichi gave it to me because it was something valuable. Will this have something to do with it? Spooky. Hey, stay with me tonight, please. Yes Mr. Genshiro? It is fate that has brought me this flute. Oh, you always say that. Well. I am keeping this. But today you will sleep alone. What? You are evil! Go carefully. Sir! Wait, sir, sir! Listen. Wait until the investigation is over. It is not my business. If a problem arises, tell the inspector to go to the Kurayami neighborhood in Shamisenbori. No, but... Goodbye. Wait, Mr. Genshiro! He wants the flute. KIKYO Kikyo... And that flute was the origin of the matter. Oh, the boss of the fight shop is out on business. I see, thank you for watching. No problem. FIGHT RECEPTION OFFICE Have you got it, idiots? I get it. In honor of the boss of the fight shop, I will not do it again. Good. It is good that you understood. Let's go fix it there. No, no, no. It is not necessary to fix it. Today, it was enough with this. Let- let's go. Bannai. The business is prospering, is it not? I wish that was true. They haggle a lot lately for the price. What about the bribes over there? Oh, the crisis is clearly felt. Did you already ate? Oh, if you invite me, I accept. Thank you. A white hood? Yes. Did you not say you had nothing to do with the geisha's murder last night? Why did the hooded man go to your house? I do not know. There is also nothing clear about the murder of the geisha. As much as I question Yamashiro, nothing comes out. I see. Yes. I have been failing lately, so I have to solve this. Anyway, it concerns me too. - Sir! - Yes? Give me tea. Yes. - Here you go. - Thank you. But you know, Genshiro? I do not understand you. In dreamless times like these, if you had stayed at work, at least you would have enough to eat. But you opposed the superiors for something absurd... and you screw an important position like that of accountant. You did something dumb. Was it absurd? The injustice of the mint? That is right. If we looked at all the mistakes, the world would be full of injustices. You have to ignore them in order to live. So, ignore... "Ignore injustice"... Senior counter Magozaemon Kiya also told me that. I objected, but the injustice of the mint was not made public. And in the end, I was forced to go to work in Kofu. Having a position in Kofu, means never to return to Edo. On top of that, what I could not bear is that in that place, full of the minor sons of vassals of the shogun, there were only obnoxious guys who did not know anything about a katana. I thought it was better to be a ronin... I had to see the faces of those guys, and I went back to Edo. I do not think I have done anything stupid at all. But the future is uncertain when living as a ronin, is it not? Well... Koen says that if something were to happen, she can at least maintain me. Do not talk nonsense, idiot! Settling for just food is a small thing. Goodbye. I hope you can solve it. Good. Soon I will have a woman to maintain me. You will see! His previous boss Magozaemon Kiya has the position of accountant. He is a greedy man with everything. He is gloomy and malicious. A fifty-year-old who has not married and has an adoptive daughter named Hagino. This daughter grew up so beautiful that is rumored to be called: "The beauty of Shitaya". Nice to see you. How is it going? Today I would like to talk calmly on this unusual visit, but unfortunately I have to go to a meeting. No. I came today because I want to ask Miss Hagino something. Hagino is not there either. Is she not? And that flute? No. Hagino will also go out with me. I see. Forgive me. Either way. I will come later. Hey, wait! Mr. Genshiro! Excuse me. Aoe! Father. - Miss Hagino. - Yes? Allow me the flute. Yes. HAGI So it is called "hagi". The song you played, how is it called? "Song of the Wild Wind". Wild wind... It so happens that I came to see you because I know that you are an expert in flutes. I am surprised they have the same build. Since when do you have it? For a long time, since I was a child. Since before being adopted? How reckless, Aoe. Do not talk about it in front of me. I am sorry. Where did you get that flute, Mr. Genshiro? The truth is that this flute is something that was commissioned from me. Do you not know who made this flute? No. It is almost time to go out. Go away for today, Aoe. Miss Hagino, I will see you later. Yes. I will be looking forward to seeing you. Hello, Genko. How are you? How are you sir? Nothing is going well. I earn a little. I will invited you to the Marutoku. Let everyone know. What? As it should be. Thank you, thank you. The boss of the fight shop is admirable, like a saint. What are you talking about? See you. Welcome, boss. She is there. Have fun. Oh, welcome home. Oh, here you are. Do not say "here you are", I got tired of waiting. What do you want? How rude. I am sorry, but I promised the neighborhood that I would invited them to the Marutoku. I see. Go carefully. I will be waiting for you here. Will you wait for me? Yes, I am going to stay here tonight. Koen... Are you that hungry? Hey, do not make fun of me! I want to talk to you. I do not know. Come on sit down. What do you want? It is about this. Tsurukichi's family name was Kikyoya? That is right. Tsurukichi Kikyoya. How was her life? I heard her mom was a shamisen teacher in Hamacho. But she died four years ago. And her dad? She never talked about her dad. That flute was a memory of his dad, and it never separated from her since she was little. Well, that is all I know. I see. Does that flute have some kind of mysterious link? Koen. I must tell you that it is dangerous for you to be alone in this house. Do not scare me. Today we will sleep together, but... In exchange for that, behave yourself. Again with that! THE FLOWER FLUTE MURDERS Shops that traded flutes were also few in Edo. One in Kurumazaka of Shitaya, one in Hanakawado and one in Shodencho of Asakusa. Yuushima, Nakasaka of Idamachi, FLUTE SHOP, MEIHODO also Akasaka, Shiba, and passing Okawa there was only one in Fukagawa. Three for the neighborhood of Nihonbashi and Renjakucho in Kanda. MASTER OF FLUTES, YAMAGIWA Although he visited many flute craftsmen, SHO'S FLUTE there where no answers anywhere. It started to get dark and he started to get tired Plus... OFFICIAL FLUTE STORE, SANCHIKUDO I know it. This is... the work of Shokichi Itto. Shokichi Itto? He was born in Kamigata. He is the only artisan who makes this lacquer finish. Strangely, people do not want him in Edo. And he has few orders. And... where does that Shokichi Itto live? Yes. He is back here. Back here? Then, thank you. Excuse me. I have arrived late. "Flowers of hagi (lespedaza), obana (iris), kuzu (kudzu), nadeshiko (carnation)... ominaeshi (patrinia), fujibakama (euparoium) and asagao (bell)". Okura. Okura is a poet from before the Nara period called Yamanoueno Okura. It is a poem written with the seven autumn plants. He did not immediately understand what Shokichi's intention was ripping out that poem. But he was intrigued by the fact that they were the seven autumn plants. Why... Okura's poem? "The seven plants of autumn"... Oh! Bannai! Why are you here? Passing by Sanchikudo, I was told to come and see because something strange was happening. Oh! It was not me. He was already like that when I arrived. I cannot say that I believe you. Hey, you are coming to the police station! Hey! Do you suspect me? That is how it is, because that is my job. Okay. This shuriken again. POLICE STATION Hey. It is rare to find yourself at a murder scene twice. And I think it will happen again. What? If it happened twice, it will happen again. If I did not know you, I would take you prisoner, but I forgive you this time. Do not hang around too much until things are resolved. Then I can help you find the criminal. Do not bother the police. Oh, take this umbrella. Get out! The boss of the fight shop is not here. I came because I have a favor to ask him. Oh, no, no, no. I do not know why, but for now he left his business. Oh, and when will he return? Sometimes he does and other times he does not. In the end, you never know. Arrest, arrest, arrest! Move! Get away, it is the police! Move! For ten days, there were murders in a row. And in all cases they were women. NADESHIKO One was Otaki, a waitress at a tea house in Okuyama, Asakusa. And the other two were sisters, Shinyoshiwara's prostitutes. Come, come! Extra, extra! As everyone knows, while the murder of the Asakusa waitress shocked the world. Another murder happened again. Two oiran were killed at the same time in Shinyoshiwara's Miura store. It amazes that the two were real sisters. I am back. Oh, welcome. Welcome. - Oh, grandmother give me a glass of water. - Yes. Hey, I heard something terrible. What? One of ours is buried in the Jokan temple in Minowa, so I go there when it is the anniversary of her death. I already know that. - Here. - Oh, thank you. - You can go, grandmother. - Okay. As you must know, in that temple they bury prostitutes, so the monk there knew the oiran killed in Shinyoshiwara. After their mother died of illness, they became prostitutes. And both sisters were reputed to be very beautiful. Again they were young people who did not know their father. That is right. Therefore, thinking about the possibility, I asked the monk if they did not have flutes. They had them. Right? That is right. And the flutes? Well, the monk said that he had seen them. But apparently, after their death, both flutes were not among their belongings. And what were the names of those two oiran murdered? The eldest was Obana, and the youngest, Makuzu. Wait... In the case of the tea house... the name of the other murdered woman... Her name was Nadeshiko. Oh, I am hungry too. And you do not wait for me. Obana, kuzu... hagi, nadeshiko... And as before, the kikyo was also called asagao... fujibakama and ominaeshi remain. The seven plants of autumn... Why are they been killed... having flutes of the seven plants? Perhaps?... It cannot be... That is a dream within a dream... What is it? What is it that cannot be? Nothing, it is my thing. No, you must tell me everything. Being honest, there are 18 women I did not tell you about. Fool! Hey. It is silly. They have successively killed people with flutes. It is so creepy. Hey, since it is creepy, what if you leave that flute you have in a temple? Just do it. Nothing good will happen if you have it. Where are you going? To Shinyoshiwara. What? Do not think bad, I am not going to have fun, silly. I am going for the case of Obana and Makuzu. THE FLOWER FLUTE MURDERS MANPACHITEI RESTAURANT A daijin from the mint? Yes. He called you, Miss Koen, so we do not have a choice. - You do not convince me. - Do not say that. This is a forced superior order and he says that a banquet without you is like seeing dry grass. You should give him his comedic performance of the faces. I ask the god of the daimyo to at least go and greet him. Think about it at least for the honor of this Ippachi. Oh, god Benten, god Buddha. You convince me. Exaggerated. So let's go right away. Mr. Daijin, thank you for waiting. The mint daijin everyone is talking about in the red-light district is Shozaburo Goto, 11th head of the mint. Go ahead, come in. Go ahead, come in, come in. Mr. Daijin, have fun. Long time no see, Mr. Daijin. I already told you not to call me "Daijin". Oh, did you tell me? - First... - Yes. Tonight I will receive an important client. That is why I insisted that it be you, Koen. I am sorry. No, do not worry Daijin... Oh, my mistake. And do you still get along with Aoe? What? I already found out... Oh, I see that you already know. Aoe is... Genshiro Aoe who was previously in accounting. Right? Yes. He is the most valuable person to me. But what a woman! You are shameless. That is the truth. Here. Could you not arrange a meeting with him? There is something I want to ask him. What about tomorrow? Okay, that is fine. Tell him that I hope we can meet calmly when it suits him. Yes. I just hope he does not lose his life for making a scandal. Even if he discover that by losing his life, if that happens in hands of someone superior that sacrifice will not be worth it. What do you mean by that? He is about to arrive. Let's go to the separate room. Excuse me, and tonight's client? It is the finance commissioner, Wakasanokami Mizuno. He sneaks in, so I expect discretion. Miss... - Miss! - What happened? Hurry! Koen... Miss Koen...! - What? - Miss...! "I will accept 'kikyo's' flute in exchange for the geisha. If you want to save her, bring the flute tomorrow between nine and eleven o'clock at night at the Shoden temple in Asakusa". WHITE FOX That night, even past the promised time the hooded man called White Fox did not appear. I do not understand. I cannot understand. I told you not to ask anything. Give me the flute. It could be dangerous for you to have it. Why? Tell me why. I cannot say it. Why? Stop insisting. There is something creepy about that flute. I say this for the sake of your life. I do not understand. Come on, bring me the flute without saying more. Father! Father! What is wrong? The flute! The flute...! What? Welcome. - Welcome. - Welcome. Miss Hagino. Heavens... But... what happened? The flute. Flute? Kikyo's flute. This is like this because they came to steal it. You should also get rid of your Hagi flute. They will stalk your life if you have it. My flute was stolen. Was it stolen? When? Last night, someone sneaked into my room. Mr. Genshiro. Does that flute have something special? No. I do not know. My father said it was a creepy flute. But he does not tell me what it is. Mr. Genshiro, was your flute also stolen? The one I had was undoubtedly stolen from me, but the one I left here was the fake "kikyo". But they will figure that out right away. And... what do you want? Is it about your flute? No. My father said that he wishes to see you, Mr. Genshiro. I came to tell you that. Forget the circumstances, talk to him and open your heart... I beg you, Mr. Genshiro. Do not fight with my father. Because he is not my real father, I cannot oppose. And that... makes me sad. Well... What else can it be? About the flute you bring... If that flute were a katana, a curse falls on it as with the cursed swords: "Muramasa" and "Shigeyoshi". A curse? I am saying that it feels something cursed. Get rid of that flute without asking anything. If you do not get rid of it, it will bring you tragedy. And nowadays... You are a suspect in the flute master's death, right? Can I ask you one thing? What? The entanglement of the flutes and the 300 thousand ryos, are they related? Four years ago, Mitsunobu, the ninth head of the Goto mint, died in prison. This man... for thirty years he stole broken gold, of the payments and the coinage of the mint... a total of 300 thousand ryos. Aoe! The fact was discovered and although Mitsunobu was imprisoned, he died four years ago without confessing anything. Where did he hide it? I heard that the whereabouts of the 300 thousand ryos is a mystery. That is a nonsense. There can be no dream story like that. I thought the same. But if it is real it would be interesting. The 300 thousand could be thirty thousand ryos. No... It could be three thousand ryos. But the bigger the rumor, the more interesting it is. Stop talking nonsense. That matter does not concern you. Now it concerns me. And as proof of it, involved with the Kikyo flute that I have, a geisha close to me... named Koen, was kidnapped. Mr. Kiya. When I worked in accounting, the reason... for which I became a ronin, was an injustice at the mint. And this case is no stranger to that rumor. That Mitsunobu... was fond of flutes. Mr. Kiya. Tell me what is behind the flutes of the seven floors. What do you say? You again, monster! I have Magoza Kiya's flute. Give me the kikyo flute you have. If you do not give it to me, to that woman named Koen I will tear her to pieces and display her before the people. What? What is going on? THE FLOWER FLUTE MURDERS Mr. samurai. How nice. I am not interested in knowing anything about what happened. Do not make that plausible face... Do you not want to play with me? Anyway... Lie down. You must be tired. It is fine by me. Turn off the light. What is going on? Do you want to embarrass me despite what I already said? I appreciate the courtesy, but... You are making fun of me. It is not that you do not like that, is it? Although I do not dislike it There are times when you do not feel like it. So it means you do not like me. No. It will sound like an excuse, but... I do not want to hear it. A man and a woman. It is just about that. No. I feel very tempted. I am tempted, but... those eyes... They look at me straight... He is my beautiful little one. He is smarter than a human. When someone bad comes he jumps up and slits their throats. Is that okay? Therefore... come here now... Listen. For me there is no problem. Wait. I like to do it, but not that someone do it to me. What? How pretentious. I know... I already know that I... Forgive me. I know that I am an artist equal to a prostitute. But, you know? An orphan like me... prefers a man who makes love to me every night, than a conceited one. You also do not know your parents. You will never know how this feels. This sadness. The man who came out... Is he Chinese? His name is Jukkan. He is a fellow dagger thrower. He works in the temporary theater in Ryogoku. I am Ofuji. I am Genshiro Aoe. You said Ofuji, right? Yes. Fujibakama... What? Do you have a flute? A flute? Fujibakama's. What are you talking about? It is okay if you do not have it. Enough is enough! You say so many nonsense things! If you do not plan to take me... Go away now! Why are you looking at me like that? Go away! I will not forget this favor. I will thank you later. I do not even want to see your face anymore! - Just one thing... - Shut up! If you have a flute, I give you some advice. Drop that flute. Your life is in danger. I do not care! That flute... Hey... Has something happened to the master of the shop? Like what? Yesterday, apparently Okane saw him and said that he walks the streets playing a flute. - A flute? - That is right. And then the women of the Red Light District scream with excitement. What would have happened that he changed his business to flutist? Mr. samurai. You are very handsome. Yesterday you also passed by here. Right. Hey, there is a limit even to extravagance. White Fox? Yes. I am trying to lure the White Fox with the flute. Jah, is this a joke from the Inari foxes? Is the White Fox the hooded one? He kidnapped Koen. Oh, right. What does the hooded man who kidnapped her want? What? I did not mean to tell you, but... you act weird. What? The flutes. The flutes? Well you know. What are you talking about? Would it be...? What? Wherever I go, you show up. Perhaps...? Will it not be you? Are you not the hooded one? I had forgotten but... You are an expert in games and martial arts. But what kind... Do not say that! I wish I was like that thug. I also do not want to be on patrol all the time. I, Bannai Shinoda, receive thirty ryos and two buchi. If I do not achieve at least a feat and ascend to yoriki, I will be worse than trash. Oh, now is not the time to laugh. Hey, Aoe. You are a suspect in the murder of the flute master and in the murder of Magozaemon Kiya. So we are enemies. Unfortunately, in that case there is no option. I swear I will catch you by the tail. Koon! Stop! Police, police! I will give you the flute, depending on the conditions. Where is Koen? Cheater! You are also a samurai! Die! I will take your hood off! Arrest! Arrest, arrest! Bannai! Police! Move, you are in the way! Do not move! Hey you! Do you plan to escape? Damn! Hey, hey... W-wait! You will not escape. But what are you saying? You showed up at a bad time. There will not be any "arrest". What? You are not the white hooded man. Of course not. Do not say you will investigate me at the police station. Oh! In exchange, teach me something. What? About the flutes. You followed me because it interested you. Yes, something like that. You are very ambitious. How dangerous. Is it that big? Goodbye. Hey! Hey, wait, wait! I just killed him. I killed Genshiro Aoe! You are an attractive woman. That is why it is impossible for you not to awaken those intentions in them. It is okay. Do whatever you want in front of my eyes. Unfortunately, you cannot do that. It was ordered to take her out without a single wound. Really? Ask your majesty. "She was questioned, but she does not know anything." "If she is left locked up, she is going to become a problem." He said that. So long ago... THE FLOWER FLUTE MURDERS What are you doing? You cheated on me. Why? Why did you save her? Did you do it for Genshiro? Did you meet Genshiro Aoe? Can you?... Can you kill me? The flute... I am the only one who knows where it is. Give me the flute. Fujibakama's. In... in exchange for that... Will you give me... opium? I will give it to you. Really? Will you seriously... give me... the opium? Where is the flute? I cannot. If I give you the flute... you... you will kill me. I will give you this as a gift for the afterlife. You have... six more sisters from different mothers. What? Is that true? I killed four of them. You? It cannot be... Impossible... Lie! That is a lie! It must have been someone else... FUJIBAKAMA It was said that the Chinese Ryogoku theater artist, Jukkan and Ofuji, were killed due to a robbery. Miss, miss! This girl brought this. Where? There on that bridge. I see. Wait a second. Take this, thank you. "I am calm knowing that you are safe. Do not look for me. Gen". And you are...? Excuse me, I am Hagino. So, you are the daughter of Magozaemon Kiya? Yes. Oh, thank you for coming to a place like this. My name is Koen. I ave heard a lot about you from Genshiro. Oh... Just now I received this letter from Genshiro. Oh... Oh, for now, come in please. Grandma, pour tea. Yes. But what did that letter say? Oh... Wow. Excellent! Mr. Genshiro is fine! By the way, miss, what did you come for? When going to ask for him where he lived, I was told that there was a lady in Yanagibashi who knows him well. Oh, who would have said that? Oh, I am ashamed. I am sorry! Did Mr. Shinoda not come? No, he did not come. - Where did he go? - Hey, hey. You seem rushed, what is it about? Well, I am sorry to say it in front of you but, as you are asking about a flutist ronin, I was told that there was a beautiful flutist. I asked where and... it turned out to be a young lady in a furisode kimono. But also, her profile was identical to that of Tsurukichi from the Kikyoya who was killed. Eh? What? She brought a black flute. And he seemed to come from an illustrious family. She lives with the grandfather who raised her and sometimes she plays the flute to earn a little spending money. A flute? Yes. Anyway, I want to tell Mr. Shinoda about it, and that is why I am running. Oh, hey. Where is that girl identical to Miss Tsurukichi? In Hatsunecho of Yanaka. She goes to the dango of Habutae. Goodbye. Here you go. The "Wild Wind" song. Rest a bit. Oh, you are very good! Come on eat. Hey, what is your name? Hey, where did you get this flute? Hey, tell me where. I will not take it from you, so let me see it, okay? Yes? I will not take it from you. Really? Yes, really. OMINAESHI I do not want to. Where did she go? Search, search! Next to the Tokiwa Bridge in Ichome, Honcho of Nihobashi there is a strange mansion. In a large lot of almost 6600 square meters there is only one gate. That gate closes at sunset and after that it is forbidden to cross it. This mansion is the mint. And it is known as the place where gold is transformed into money. It is where gold is minted to koban, kotsubu, etc. It is here as I expected. THE FLOWER FLUTE MURDERS This land strictly blocked from the outside by two fences is divided into four parts, the foundry, the residence of the boss, the officials' offices, and the houses of the workers of the mint and their subordinates. All workers live inside the mint, and they are forbidden to go out except at the end of the year. The mansion in Shozaburo Goto Mitsukane, eleventh head of the mint, was connected to a long corridor from the place where like a palace there is a thick wooden door. That Magoza Kiya... Surely he must have regretted it. He was very close to reaching a portion of the 300 thousand ryos. By eliminating Jukkan, the Chinese, and Ofuji, the ones that remain are the two of us. There is nothing better than the portion being bigger, right? I would keep it all if possible. Just kidding, just kidding. Only one flute is missing. It is the "kikyo" that Genshiro Aoe has. The secret of the whereabouts of the 300 thousand ryos is in these flutes. The flutes of the flowers are seven in total. Once you have all we will know where the 300 thousand ryos are hidden. Mitsunobu, the ninth boss, died in prison without revealing anything. He had no children, no offspring. The government surrendered having no clues, but I did not give up. The tenth chief, and I, the eleventh, are not related by blood. Did Mitsunobu, the ninth chief, really have no offspring? Well, he did. He had mistresses and illegitimate daughters. He made those seven lovers had a daughter, each one. And to each of those seven daughters, they were given a flute. But... none of those seven, learned that his father was Mitsunobu, the ninth head of the Goto mint. He hid who he was even to his blood daughters. Only one flute is missing. But whoever has it is someone fearsome. Who is it? You finally came. Assassin! - Face him! - Face him! It was you as I supposed. You are an idiot. You have cornered me. You killed a lot of people, Bannai. I had no choice. It was so that instead of a lifetime as a useless officer I could get a big dream. You changed, Bannai. I had suspected it, but... In this situation, one of the two must die. The world... is made for the bad guys to win. I did not think I would have to kill you. I do not like that either. How about this? Let's unite and split the profit. No way. If you insist that you will not leave... I will have to kill you. Hey, answer me one thing. Who was the other hooded man that time? The Chinese named Jukkan. He did well, did he not? He was a fellow actor of Ofuji. The one who also killed Shokichi Itto... was you. Instead, think about it one more time. Yes? Join me and you will live like a king. There is no evidence against me, more than you. You can kill me. But what a ridiculous conversation. Stop. I will no longer flatter you. Did you know this? Since before I... I have envied you... and hated you. That is right. I was good at games and martial arts, but I have not surpassed you in anything. Not in status, manhood, women or how to live in this world. But Genshiro... now I am up. Bannai! Die! Flowers, flowers. Flowers. Flowers. Flowers, flowers. Flowers, flowers. Flowers, flowers. It is a lie, right? That this reveal the hiding place of the 300 thousand ryos. It is something that is hard to believe exists in this world. It would be terrible if it existed. When it exists, it will be terrible because everything would change daily. Right, miss? You are right. And even if I find that money, that amount will not enter my pocket. If we want to conclude things by giving it to a superior, it will not be worth it. If we give it to him, he could give us a reward. A reward for 300 thousand ryos... How much would he give us? It makes no sense to ask that of me. You are right. Surely that is false. That huge amount would be a problem. It is probably a story they made up for fun. Those guys, as ambitious as they were, maybe they got excited about something that does not exist. That is right. Surely it is. Koen... What? Bring me a brush and paper. What will you do? Just bring it. Yes. For you, Miss Hagino... this came to an unexpected end. You lost your father and your real father is a man who died in prison, Mitsunobu, ninth head of the mint. From now on I will adopt and live with that little blood sister. If I can be of any help... look me up. Can I trust you? As an older brother? Hey, what are you going to do? Let's try it... just in case. TA So this is it. Koen... TA BU BU MI MI NO NO SHI SHI SHI SHI I I I know. "Hagi flowers, obana, kuzu, nadeshiko... ominaeshi, fujibakama and asagao flower". Okura Yamanoue. Okura? He is an ancient poet. It is "The Seven Plants of Autumn," is it not? That is right. First is the "I" of the hagi flower. "SHI", "BU", "MI" from obana, kuzu and nadeshiko. And it keep going. "I-shi-bu-mi." "Ishibumi" which means stone monument. It is a monument with "Seven Autumn Plants" of Okura. Oh, amazing! How clever you are! Look at the others. It says "no-shi-ta" (down from). Look, it is under the monument. It does exist! The monument with Okura's poem is in the Terashima Flower Garden. What do you think Koen? We still do not know anything. It happens that you reach that point and in the end it is a hoax. Let's go. "Flowers of hagi, obana, kuzu, nadeshiko... ominaeshi, fujibakama and asagao flower". OKURA Bring a bucket. Here, madam. You have to dig more. Faster, faster. Dig, dig. Faster, faster. They will know what is in there if they dig. What are you talking about? Dig. It is near! Dig, dig. It does exist!
