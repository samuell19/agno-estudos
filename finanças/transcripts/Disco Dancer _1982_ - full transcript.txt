Why did you bring Raju brother's guitar? His mother is sick. He gave me his guitar and he went to his village. And he said to tell bhabhi not to worry. If you need anything then write me a letter. But he didn't give the address. No problem. I have his address. Even your father belonged to that village. Mother, what did father do? He and your Raju uncle used to sing together. And Anil, your father wanted you to become a great artist. I'll surely be one, mother. I'll fulfill my father's wish. Now go and freshen up and then eat your dinner. I'll first eat and then I'll take a wash. I'm famished. But mother, how can I go to work all alone? You're not alone. I'll come with you. Why don't you eat? Mother, you know. I eat only with your hands. Hey! Come in. You sing so well. Yes, my father used to say, sing from your heart, not your throat. Do you play this? - Yes. Play it. - Will you sing? - Yes. Even I know your song. Let's begin. 1.. 2.. 3. Why are you laughing? - You don't know how to play. You don't learn to play a guitar if you buy one. Give it to me. Not here. Let's go in. Come.

You've come at the right time, inspector. This boy was stealing the guitar and trying to run away. He's lying! - My son is not a thief, inspector! Keep quiet! Inspector, it has become difficult to live.. ...because of these poor street people. Take him away. I'll send somebody else to write the FIR. I stole the guitar, inspector. He is a poor kid. He liked it. I couldn't control myself. Take me away. - Constable, take the guitar from the kid. Son, you go home. - I won't let you take my mother away. Inspector sir, all these are lies. My mother is not a thief. Even I'm not a thief, inspector sir. All these are lies. I've cooked this bread for you with my own hand, mother. Mother. Eat it. No need to worry, mother. I'll sit outside the prison. I've decided that I'll grow up quickly. And I won't spare that wealthy sir. - Son. Mother and son are thieves! Mother and son are thieves! Mother and son are thieves! Mother and son are thieves! Look, 2 thieves are coming. Mother and son are thieves! Mother and son are thieves! Mother and son are thieves! Mother and son are thieves!

The food doesn't taste so good when I eat with my own hands. Mother. - Yes. When I'll become famous and when this cruel city will respect me.. ...that day I'll eat from your hands only in the party. And that day I'll remind this cruel city.. ...that I'm the same child.. Before whom.. ...you had humiliated his mother. Why don't you forget all this? How can I forget it? I'll never forget it. That day is alive like a fresh wound. That day when that man was slandering you.. ...the streets, the shade, the sunlight of this city.. ...nobody said anything. That city will have to respect you. Mother, I have my music. I will sharpen this music.. like a sword. And I will stab that city. Hi, dad. -Hi, son. I'm going. - When will you return? Can't say. I'll go to Pune from here and then Goa.

Come out! Who is this, rascal! Sam, I'm David Brown, your manager. You should know that before entering a room, you should knock. You should know the difference.. ...between a green room and a bedroom. I'm not in the mood to listen to your speech. Say what the work is and let me rest. Oh, honey! After you're free from this work, get ready. We have to go to the airport. You have a show tomorrow in Chandigarh. To hell with Chandigarh! Go and learn how to talk to your boss. Chandigarh wants Sam's music. Then tell them to come to Sam. Look, Sam.. More important than this girl.. ...are your audience who will be waiting for you tomorrow evening. You'll have to come. It's a commitment. What if I say that I'm not in the mood? Then I think your bad days are about to begin. - Shut up! Sam can never be ruined. Sam is great, you know. Sam is the music king. Sam is a star. Sam is the heartbeats of countless girls. Now get out.. Then appoint another manager for yourself. Listen.. 36 managers like you are willing to serve me. But a star like Sam is born once in a lifetime. And his downfall is also very soon. Get out, you rascal! Nikki! Nikki! - Yes, dad. Come out. I want to have a word with you. Brown, Mr. Brown, you made a big mistake.. ...by leaving a superstar like Sam. What about my show? I will be ruined. - You don't worry. Yes, dad. You called me? - I left Sam's job. Dad, this is your everyday news. This is the truth. That tin man, that hoax of a disco dancer thinks.. ...that I should be a superstar's secretary. After falling apart from me, he'll realize my worth. I'll make a new star shine in the sky of disco. And Sam will drown in his brilliance, Nikki. "The music bonanza" "The lights all above" "It's a celebration" "How can I resist so much temptation?" Look, I've told you before too. You are just first grade. But.. You must be thinking that Sammy's manager is mad. I'm no longer Sammy's manager. My mother. - Greetings. - Greetings. Mother, Mr. David Brown. - Your son's manager. What! - Yes. Have a seat. - Mother, sit. He is Gulab Nabi. He wants to organize Anil's program. Greetings. - He is a bit nervous. But I've told him that if there is a loss in the show.. ..then I'll cover it up. This might reveal the extent of trust.. ..that I have on you and your talent. "Jesus." "Jesus, are You coming to us?" "Jesus. Jesus, come back to us." "It's for our salvation" "Come back to us. Come back O Saint" "Save us, save us. Halleluiah." "It's for our salvation" Will Nikki come? How can she not come? She is my daughter. Hello. - Hello. Nikki, why have you still not reached here? I'm sorry, dad. I can't come. You will have to come. My reputation is at stake. Sam.. - To hell with Sam! Nikki! Nikki! - Why? What happened? Sam disconnected the call. - Now what? You don't worry. The show will go on. I will do it! Hey, what are you pondering? I was thinking of what must be going on in the show. Shall I tell you? - Yes. My sister Geeta along with her friends will be ready.. ..to shower their beautiful sandals on that new artist.

But there is less of grace and more of pride in this beauty. Maybe even brain. And your brain reeks of money. I'm beautiful. And I'm proud of my beauty. If my brain reeks of money, it is because.. ..my father is an affluent man. And what are you? A street singer. Dancer. A street singer and a dancer. Wasn't this what you were screaming yesterday night? Listen, baby. Or whatever your name is. I've come to give the answer for that. An affluent man like your father.. ..had sold my talent to the street. I've learned tunes from the streets of Goa. I've learned rhythm from the lanes. And last night you tried to thwart my toil of many years. But my mother's blessing made me successful. And I swear on that mother some day.. ..I'll be so renowned that you'll come to take my autograph. Not on paper. On this lip. And I don't know whether I'll give you.. ..an autograph that day or not. My foot! Yes, we received the money. Thank you. Bakshi sir.. book 3 tickets to Mumbai for tomorrow. Yes. 'Mother and son are thieves! Mother and son are thieves!' Let him reach Mumbai once. Everything will bear his name. Jimmy ice-cream, Jimmy chocolates. Jimmy fabrics, Jimmy T-shirts. Jimmy this and that. Which tea he uses, which cream he uses.. ..which color he likes, he doesn't like. No, Brown sir. I won't allow Anil to go to Mumbai. No, mother.. we will go to Mumbai. That city has to repay my childhood's debts. Brown sir, we'll go to Mumbai. "Neither dark-skinned nor fair-skinned." "The world belongs to the compassionate ones." "Live with joy and die with joy." "We compassionate people." "Neither dark-skinned nor fair-skinned."

You must be preparing for your show. Rascal! Don't tire yourself out. Because I've bought your program. And a third grade person like you can't.. ..participate in David Brown's program. Jimmy will participate in that program instead of you. Understood! - You scoundrel! I'll sue you for defamation and breach of contract. Go ahead. But when you'll talk about your respect.. ..my lawyer will question you, what respect? Now about breach of contract. I'll honor that contract. You'll get your money. You can't do this to me! You can't do this to me! I'm a superstar! I'm a major superstar! See you! See you! God! David Brown, you want to ruin me! I'll not spare you! I'll not spare your artist too! Mr. Albert. - Yes, sir. I want to meet Basco immediately. You don't worry, sir. With so much money, I'll kill that guy and his family too. No, no, no. You just don't allow him to come for today's show. I don't mind, sir. Your work will be done. Bless me, mother! Today is my first show in Mumbai. God bless you. I was waiting for this day only. Go. May God protect you and your music! What happened? - Sir, the car broke down. I have my show today. I have to reach there quickly. You can catch another cab, sir. What do you all want? Look, I don't have anything. I'm a poor man. I know that you're broke. Then let me go. - You can't go. Why? -You want an answer. Look, you have been mistaken. This is the first show of my life. Let me go. Why don't you understand? I'll lose everything. If I've made some mistake, then forgive me. Thrash him so badly that he shouldn't.. ..regain consciousness till morning. No! What? But Anil left a long time back, David sir. He has still not reached. Everything will be wasted if he doesn't reach here on time. Lord Krishna, protect my son! "Lord Krishna, descend on the earth." "Lord Krishna, teach us about love."

Till the time the sun and the moon rise, he should.. ..continue to sing like this and the world should dance to his tunes. Enough, Sam. - I am not getting the high. Oh Gosh! What do his songs have that my songs don't have? He is just a street singer. Hi, dad! - Hi, dear. How are you? - Fine. Why has this man come here? Why has he come? Please, Sam! He has come to see the show of my downfall! Sam. - No. You had to be ruined. I've come to meet my daughter. In her house. Sam! - Get out! I'm sorry, dad. I'm very sorry, dad. - It's alright, dear. Sam doesn't rules the world of music. In just a few days people will forget him. No! I'm great! I'm still great! Great! I'm a thing forever! Forever! You used to have your own life too.

The day I become renowned. See this. - I'll make you all wealthy. Take this. - No. Have it, buddy. Take this.. take. Take. - I don't want money. - Why? I want to sit with you like old days and drink. No alcohol. - No alcohol. The place where you are going has only scotch. Enjoy the taste of Indian alcohol too. God knows whether later on you will get the chance or not. This is not so. Actually the Indian brand is too intoxicating. No matter what. We'll drink Indian brand only. Am I right, buddies? - Yes! Fine. We'll have a drink today. But at the place where we'd begun our journey. Yes, let's go! - Not there. Here. Wow! Indian alcohol and foreign car! Let's go! - Indian alcohol and foreign car! Now we all are intoxicated!

Mother and son are thieves! Mother and son are thieves! Mother and son are thieves! Mother and son are thieves! Mother and son are thieves! Mother and son are thieves! What happened, buddy? This is the same community.. from where.. ..people had banished us saying that we're thieves. Am I a thief? I'm not a thief. Even my mother is not a thief. Then how did these people.. I'm not a thief. Even my mother is not a thief. I'm not a thief! I'm not a thief! I'm not a thief! My mother is not a thief! My mother is not a thief. Wake up! I'm not a thief! Even my mother is not a thief! My mother is not a thief! I.. I.. He is Jimmy! The famous artist! Yes.. I'm Jimmy. The child.. whom you all had banished.. ..from this community as a thief. Jimmy! Jimmy, dear! I'm Rahim uncle! I'm Rahim uncle! Rahim uncle, you are God's man, aren't you? Ask your God, am I a thief? Is my mother a thief? - No, dear. She is a Goddess. Her sacrifices have made you so successful today. You're right, Rahim uncle. She is a Goddess. Yes, dear. Every person has to give account of their deeds. These people had banished you and your mother.. ..accusing both of you of robbery. But now Oberoi's men are banishing them from here. Dear.. dear.. God knows when the storm will strike. Oberoi sir, this is the same man. He has committed 7 murders in London. He was a great singer. I don't recollect his name. He only had murdered him. He is a hard-core criminal. The net profit of this year is 36,54,219 rupees. From this we're paying the income tax on 6 lakhs only. Well done. Sir, we were not successful in evacuating the community. Why? Sathe Swatantra is the MLA. He is a decent man who doesn't accept bribe. He has raised a chaos. Even the police can't help us. What nonsense! If the life line of that Swatantra, MLA is so long.. ..then when will Basco come to our aid? The place should be evacuated within 3 weeks. Understood! Stop! Stop! Have mercy! Stop! You rascals! Fear God! Oh my God! No! Fear the wrath of God! Rascals! Don't do this! Don't do this! For Allah's sake! Allah, help us! Allah! Stop! Jimmy dear! Jimmy dear! Save us from these cruel people! Save us! Save us from these cruel people! Save us! If anybody touches the belongings, then I'll break his hands! Keep the belongings down! Why have you all stopped! Throw the stuffs out! Turn all the houses into dust! It is not so easy to turn these houses into dust This mud has now turned into stone.. ..after being mixed with their sweat. It is good if you return. - I've not come to return. I think you all don't understand the language of love. Who has sent you! Speak up! P.N Oberoi. Go! Tell him that I'm no longer a kid! I've grown up! Go! Allah, thank you! Thank you! Geeta! Geeta dear.. remember we've to attend.. ..Mehra sir's party day after tomorrow. There are no buts, darling. We've to go. Okay? - Okay. I'll surely come. - Bring your mother too. Yes. I'll bring mother along too. Bye. Where are you taking me, son? Mother, Mehra sir is organizing a.. ..birthday bash for his daughter. He has called you too. - What will I do in the bash? Come and see mother, how these affluent people.. ..of big city hover around your son. Just to click a snap. - Really? - You'll come, won't you? 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2.. The technique behind this step.. - Jimmy has come! Where are you going? - Leave me. Jimmy has come. Jimmy has come!

Jimmy, rascal! He has snatched away my fans. He has snatched away my future! I'll kill him. I'll kill him. Have courage, my son. Have courage. Come. - Come, Jimmy, come. Mr. Jimmy, ma'am, come. Ladies and gentlemen, on the occasion of my.. ..daughter Dolly's 18th birthday, I present a gift. An evening with your favorite star, Mr. Jimmy. Give him a big hand! Hi, Jimmy. Mr. Jimmy, you're crying. Yes. Today I've cried after 18 years. But there is a difference between.. ..these tears and the tears of 18 years ago. Those tears belonged to a helpless, poor boy. But today's tears belong to a famous star. Present amongst today's guests.. ..is the man who'd made me cry. He had humiliated my mother. He has raked up the old wound. So I can only cry, not sing in this party. "What your heart says." "Do that, buddy." "Neither dark-skinned nor fair-skinned." "The world belongs to the compassionate ones." Today I want to.. introduce my two mothers. One mother is this Goddess, her name is Radha. She waited for my bright future for 18 years. The pain in my voice has come from her heart to mine. And my second mother.. is the street of this city. I've been raised there. I've walked barefoot on it under the harsh sunlight. But these streets never forbid me from singing. Today from the Mumbai's Mayor's house.. ..I salute those kind streets. Dolly Kanderwal, on your 18th birthday.. ..I present these tears to you. Mr. Jimmy, please cut the cake for me. Please. Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday dear Dolly! Happy birthday to you! It's the most wonderful birthday.. ..that is the dream of every young girl. 'When I'll become famous and when this cruel city will respect me.. ..that day I'll eat from your hands only in the party.' Wow! In today's world, the son is eating from mother's hand! Dolly.. today I'm fulfilling an old promise I'd made to my mother. Hello. I didn't know you are the same boy. - Yes, I'm the same boy. I still have that guitar. - What guitar? Jimmy! Jimmy! Meet him. Mr. P.N Oberoi. Staunch supporter of modern music. Hello, Jimmy. - Jimmy. I'm sorry, Mr. Mehra. The hands that had once slapped my mother.. ..I can't shake hands with it. Don't worry, mother. Today you're not the mother of a helpless son. And this man can't slap you before everybody. And he can't send you to prison for the crime of robbery. Because my money has purchased respect and decency. And today I'm a very decent man of this city. I'm sorry, Dolly. I spoilt your party. Say sorry to him, Mr. Oberoi. - Dolly! Daddy! You spoilt my party by inviting such a man! - Dolly! I will kill this man! - Shut up! Apologize otherwise I'll not spare him! Leave him! - Leave me! Leave! Go! Sorry, Mr. Oberoi. She is a mad girl! - I'll take his revenge! Come! Shameless girl! Clean it up. Mother. - These tears are of happiness, dear! I only told you.. that forget that insult. But it didn't mean that I had forgotten that insult. It was the only liability on my heart. Today, you have freed me from that liability. Now even if I die, I will die happily. - Mother! I don't owe anything to this city. And even this city doesn't owe anything to me. Jimmy! The insult of this P.N. Oberoi will cost you too much! Too much! I've come to take an autograph. Where is your autograph book? When that night, in mayor uncle's party.. ..I came to know that you are the same.. ..then I could feel your wounds that you had got.. ..ages before in my house, along with my pain. I couldn't even sleep. Wounds are healed.. but it leaves behind scars. I will erase all those marks with my love. Promise. I promise you, my beloved. You are my heart. You are my life. To live.. to live my life here, to live for you. If you are not there, then what is here? I'm going. - When will you meet again? Let's meet tomorrow. - Hey! Tomorrow it's too late. Learn to wait for tomorrow. Tomorrow will not come day after tomorrow. Tomorrow will come tomorrow only. Bye! Geeta! -Yes? Till tomorrow, take some sweet thing to remember. Where are you coming from? From outside. - Who was with you? Jimmy was with me! Don't you feel ashamed to roam.. ..about with your brother's enemy! Oh come on, dad! First thing is that if I would feel ashamed of.. ..then why would I go with him. And secondly, he isn't Sam's enemy. He is just superior disco dancer than Sam. And you know I'm a lover of disco music. He is fantastic! Listen to him sometime. Watch him sometime. Oh! He is a dream. Girls of prestigious families doesn't.. ..even dare to dream without their parent's consent! Do you know, he is using you as a ladder.. .. to share my prestige, to acquire my wealth!

I'm scared that he may.. - No! Where is Sam? - Over there. Sam! Sam! - Yeah? - What are you doing to yourself? Dear, come to your senses! Come to my senses? For what? To bear insult and rudeness! Sam is finished, dad! Your son is dead! Son, have faith. I will set everything right. Nobody! Nobody can do anything for me. Your wealth, your reputation, your power.. ..everything has been ruined by that beggar Jimmy. He carried away your daughter and you could do nothing! And due to him your son will be destroyed.. ..and you will be able to do nothing. I will not let you be harmed even a bit, dear. Even if I've to kill him for that! Tomorrow Jimmy is going to a party. People will ask him to play an electric guitar. And he will play. And the moment he will be about to.. ..touch the electric guitar my men will.. ..connect Jimmy's guitar's string to 5000 volts power. Then, our enemy will get blown away. How do you like my plan? - Good. I like it. Hi. - Hello. Hello, uncle. - Hello. Who is she? - She is my son's friend. Mother. - Yes, dear. You too come with us. - No, fool! Are you a child that you want to.. ..take your mother everywhere? Please come, mother. If I didn't have to do 'Janmashtami' worship.. ..then I would have come. You both go. - Mother, you.. God bless you. - Here. Come on, let's go. Move! Move! Move aside! Jimmy sir is coming! Move! Hello. - Hello, is Jimmy at home? He has gone out. Listen, the guitar that Jimmy is going to play has current. It is a ruse to kill Jimmy. - What! No! Today you all have given me so much respect. This is the same place where in my childhood.. ..I used to sing with my teacher Raju for 10 paisa. Jimmy, you'll sing today too! Jimmy, you'll sing today too! Jimmy, you'll sing today too! Jimmy, you'll sing today too! Yes. I'll surely sing today. Oh God! Jimmy sir, now you play the guitar. Mother! Hi, Jimmy. Did you sleep at night? How long will you stay awake? Jimmy, I.. Why did she die my death? Mothers make sacrifices for their children. And will her soul rest in peace seeing your condition? But what should I do, David sir? The music that is in your throat and your fingers.. ..share that with the world. I can't sing, David sir. I.. Look, Jimmy. Everybody live their life and die their life. If you love mother as much as you think you do.. ..then don't consider her as dead. She is with you every moment. She is in the dreams that she had weaved for you. She wanted your music to be renowned. Make mother alive in your music. Infuse your music with your mother. Sing. Jimmy, sing. Jimmy please, sing. That night along with my mother.. ..a part of my music.. my spirit must also have died. So if you find too much pain in today's song.. ..if you find tears in my tune.. then forgive me. No! 'Mother!' No! No! Jimmy! -No! No! -Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy! Sam! Sam, there is good news! - Is Jimmy dead? Almost. Now he will never be able to sing. He has guitar phobia. - Guitar phobia? Yes. It means he is afraid of guitars. Because guitar was the cause of his mother's death. Now he will never be able to touch guitar. Even if he gets well.. Basco will see to it that he never sings. He will follow him like a shadow. Sam! The victim has got trapped in its own net. Stop! Break his legs! Throw him in the bushes. Please. - Please. Ask questions one by one. How's Jimmy? -Better. Will he be able to perform on stage? - Why not? Will Jimmy be able to participate in the next.. ..month's international disco competition? Yes. Will he win it? -Yes. Can you say how all this happened? - Please! No! No more. Please, one last question. Uncle, we collected alms and bought this for Jimmy. Tell him on our behalf that he will have to get better. All the streets boys and girls of Mumbai are praying for him. He belongs to us. Even he was a street kid like us. I'll tell him. He will have to get well for your sake. He will surely sing on the 10th of the next month for your sake. Will he sing, uncle? - Yes. Thank you, uncle. Thank you. Jimmy will not sing. Otherwise I'll die. And I don't want to see Jimmy alive before my death. I understood, boss. Jimmy will not sing. And if he sings then that will be the last program of his life. Good. - Cheers.
