Looks like we'll see record temperatures this week, right, Marta? That's right, as the week progresses, we'll track this mass of warm air but over the next few days, temperatures could exceed all historical maximums since records began. Red alerts for heatwaves are starting to appear all over the peninsula and the authorities are recommending extreme precaution especially for the elderly. These recommendations include staying hydrated... With blood-stained tears I told the story Of this sacrosanct love That you brought to life With blood-stained tears I bought back my glory And turned it into song... And your mouth And your hair And the white warmth That you poured into me My soul was ripped out today Like a beast in heat And I don't know what I want Because I want you 103,82 ºF THE ELDERLY Wait for me in heaven, my love If you're the one who goes first Wait for me I'll join you soon Wherever you may be Wait for me in heaven, my love If you're the one who goes first Wait for me in heaven, my love So that we can start again Our love is so strong So immense It's never-ending And this life is so short And it's not enough For our romance So I'm asking you Please Wait for me in heaven And, there, Among clouds made of cotton We'll build our nest Dad? Dad, wait. Dad, please wait. What is it? Shouldn't we talk? Fine. What do you want to know? I don't know. I don't understand, dad. It's the static noise. The magnetic waves. Dad? Are you okay? Yes. Was she family, dear? My grandma. It's the rule of life. Us old people have to die to make way for you. Right? Naia. Come on. Want some water? Where are you going, dad? I'm off, son. I have to buy batteries. Batteries? Wait a minute, dad. Get your head straight. Please. You can't get by alone. You know that. Why don't you come and live with us? It's time for me to look after you. It's time, dad. I won't go where I'm not wanted. No, but... She agrees. Your wife would certainly have agreed. Dad, please don't start. I'll take the bus. Where's he going? Who knows. Naia! I'll be back later. I told you not to come. Everything okay? Get me out of here, please. What's this? A video game school. VIDEO GAME CREATION That shit's expensive. I can't afford it. As you wish. Or you could babysit for the rest of your life. Yeah. Cleaning up shit at 90 years old. Are you ever going to tell me why you're called Jota? Guess. I'd better not. It's probably Jorgito, or worse... I'll tell you one day. - When I'm grown up? - Nah... When you're old. Being old's gross. Nobody listens to you, they ignore you. That's right. I'll be shit scared. Why? Everything... Of losing my mind and ending up alone for however long I have left. Your grandad's not alone. He's got you. Old people know what's coming to them. They've been preparing their whole lives. I won't be scared. I don't care right now. I won't be wrinkly for ages. We don't know that. What? We could die tomorrow. Here. How do you manage here without a lift? I'm Mario, by the way. We just moved in. I just met the neighbours opposite. They're charming. I'd kill for a cigarette. Lena, please. Your leave started yesterday. Put that box down. Naia. Can you help Lena? You said I just had to do my room. Mario, this may seem stupid, what if we don't know everything about your dad? No. The police said my mum committed suicide. End of story. You think your dad's okay? No. That's why I want to look after him here. This is important to me, Lena. Where will we put him? In the end room. That's the baby's room. It's a big house! And there's a way to go. We'll see. Are you okay? Yes. Try to understand, Mario. We can't make sacrifices. We just lost our house, with everything else going on, and now your dad. You have a job now. Naia makes some money sometimes and I'll find something soon. Find what? You haven't installed an AC unit for four months. People are broke. Accept it. Lena, my dad's always helped whenever he could. So what? Mine gave us this house, they're not living here. Here we go... I do understand. But it can't happen. What happened isn't our fault. No... but he's my dad, Lena. His wife just died. My mum. They were married for almost 50 years so I think the least we can do is lend him a hand. So do I. He's my grandad, Lena. Fine. I'm the wicked witch in this story, right? Do what you want. I think I have keys for here. Dad? Dad? It's us. Open up! Dad? Dad? Maybe he's out. He's home. Dad. How are you? Here. Let me help you. And the rest? It can stay here for now. What? We'll come back for it. I'll help you, grandad. Give that here. I'll take the suitcase then. Dad... Naia will put the air-con on to keep you nice and cool. The wiring's pretty old but there's a lamp on the desk. Dad. It's just temporary, you'll see. And lay it at your feet I'll help you, grandad. And turned it into song And lay it at your feet How old was grandma here? Like me, or older? I have a picture of mum too. When she was young. Does she talk to you at night too? Naia, help me take this furniture downstairs. Like a beast in heat And I don't know what I want Because I want you And your mouth And your hair And the white warmth That you poured into me My soul was ripped out today... Music. It looks delicious. We'll fix the electrics. Shall I serve you, Naia? Yes, serve her. Naia. Come on, you love this. It's a country salad. I'm not really hungry. You'll waste away. Put your phone away. Enough? Yes. Do you like it? Do you like it? Dad? Dad? Is something wrong? Your wife's food was good. Dad. Lena's my wife now. Lena. Where are you going, Naia? I've finished. A lot doesn't make sense. Rosa... She had her wits about her, why would she kill herself? It makes no sense. And your dad... Why won't he let you into the flat? It's really weird. You should take a look around after the funeral tomorrow. Have you told everyone? What? About the funeral. No. And I won't. 106,88 ºF 108,86 ºF Mario. Mario! Yes? What? You know what? You're going to your dad's house tomorrow. Promise me. Promise me. Fine, damn it... First letter of St Paul to the Corinthians. Brothers. I tell you a mystery. We shall not all die, but we will all be changed, in an instant, in the blink of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed. Many who lie in the dust will awaken, some for eternal life... Naia. Others for perpetual disgrace. And those who taught justice to many will shine like stars for all eternity. Rosa left us when nobody expected it. She leaves behind a life dedicated to loving those dear to her. A hard-working life expecting nothing in return... Naia... She's waiting for you. Hello. Grandma? I hear them. Naia. Are you okay? Naia. Dad. Grandad. Yes? Why did she do it? Do you know what our first argument was? The Civil War had finished a few years earlier. One day, when we became boyfriend and girlfriend, we were walking through the outskirts, near the Fuente del Berro and we ran into Guerrita, a bastard who was in love with your grandma. She was so beautiful. And that bastard, because he was a real bastard, stood in front of us and said we couldn't pass without doing the fascist salute. What did you do? I knew that Guerrita was always armed and I was scared for your grandma so I lifted up my arm. I mean, it wasn't such a big deal, was it? But your grandma... Oh, your grandma. Rosa stood up to him, challenging him, like a beast about to pounce. And I noticed her hand just resting by her side. I grabbed your grandma's hand and shoved it into the air. Guerrita laughed like a hyena. And you know what? Your grandma never forgave me for that laugh. She took orders from nobody. She never gave in. She was unique. Like you. That's why she's gone. I've told you that story more than once, haven't I? Yes. Lots of times? Yes. Thank you. Naia. What? Nothing. Let's head home, grandad. It's getting late. You go. I'll stay for a while. Okay, but don't be too late, okay? Eeny, meeny, miny, mo Catch a tiger by the toe If he hollers, let him go Eeny meeny miny mo Hide your hand The old woman's coming 111,38 ºF 111,56 ºF JUNE JULY Fucking hell, dad. Yes? Is everything all right? Excuse me? Everything's fine, isn't it? I don't really understand, I just came to... get some of my dad's things. Your mum says don't forget to lock the door. Excuse me? What did you say? Your mum says that you always forget to lock the door. I sent them to you. Give me your phone. I took some photos. It's all quite neat and tidy. See? Mario, please. How many hours did you spend cleaning up? What do you mean? - Come on... - I wasn't cleaning, why would I? My dad keeps it clean, damn it. - You were gone for ages. - Well... I went for a drink at the bar afterwards. I believe the part about the bar. Believe what you want. Seriously. There was nothing strange? What do you mean "strange"? It's full of junk. Old people's stuff. What you'd expect. Well, a weird neighbour gave me a fright. A weird neighbour? Weird how? What happened? Hey. Is it really 12:30 a.m.? Naia. Where's grandad? Naia! - What? - Where's your grandad? He was in the park. He wanted to be alone. What were you thinking, Naia? - Isn't he back yet? - Let's go and find him. Put your phone down. I'm asking a friend to help us. Back in a minute. Where are you going? INCOMING CALL Hello? Hello? Dad? Dad? Dad? My grandma jumped from there. Yeah. It's dark inside. Your grandad isn't there. If anything's happened... Come. Hang on. Who is he? I don't know... but he might know something. Looking for something? My grandad. He's lost. He's here. What? Here, in the back. What do you mean? Where? I HEAR THEM Back here. Can't you see him? Look closer. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THEM Grandad? Let go of me! Get off her! Let go of me! Can you hear them? Get off me! Don't you hear them? Don't you? He's not up there. What's wrong? Let's go, please. I'll tell you later. - Did something happen? - I'll tell you at home. Let's call the police. He could become dehydrated in this heat. Your mum was right. Lena's not my mum. Grandad's old and sad, which is normal, right? Are you going to lock him up? What do you mean? Why the fuck are you here? He's my boyfriend. Give me that. I've dreamt this... It's Lena. Lena. Dad. It's me, Mario. I'm here with Naia. Where are you going? Your grandma's coming back. Nice and easy, Manuel. I'm almost done, okay? There's a rare strain of Alzheimer's that tends to appear after powerful emotional shocks. It's called Pick's disease and this type of illness can make things around the sufferer seem a bit... strange. At advanced stages, it can manifest itself as psychotic episodes, auditory and visual hallucinations and very rarely... even violence. But let's not get ahead of ourselves, okay? For the time being, I'll prescribe him some sedatives. Strong ones, to put your minds at ease. And... let's see how he reacts to the treatment. Of course, the heat, changes in the family, his age... None of that helps. Okay? Have him take this and drink lots of water, that's important, okay? You know where to find me if you need me. Have you considered hospitalising him? Hospitalise him where? A nursing home, dad. A retirement home, Mario. 115,34 ºF 117,32 ºF What? This can't go on. What? So yesterday was nothing? It's been two days, this place is like a haunted house. All day locked up in there... Who knows what he's up to. - I'll talk to him. - No! That's not it. Can't we talk about it? And don't say it'll pass. It's a downward spiral and he's taking us with him. Something must be done. Fine, I'll go get him and kick him out right now. Dad? Can't you see what's happening? To Naia and to me? Or don't you care? - It's not all because of my dad. - Yes, it is, Mario. React. Do something. I don't know. Anything. Put him in a home. Close your eyes. Don't move. Right. Lock him up in a home like a crazy person. Let him rot and die there. No, let him rot here instead. If he stays something will happen, something horrible, I mean it. I'm scared! Naia, what's wrong? What is it? Tell me. She jumped. She jumped again! Jota says this course has great prospects. Everyone's a gamer nowadays. Gamers have prospects? The guy from the other night? - Come on, really? - Is he cute? He's a smarty pants, that's what he is. Why Jota, anyway? Is his real name Jorgito? Idiot. Pass the potatoes. No, go on. Tell us. Is he your boyfriend? Looks like it, but they've got no idea. - You don't care. - Of course we do! Right, Mario? Of course, tell us everything. You're going to die tomorrow. What did you say? What did he say? Grandad? Sorry, dad. We didn't get that. I'm going to kill you. Tomorrow. In the night. That's it! Naia and I are leaving. Come on. Hang on a minute, wait. What the hell are you saying, dad? Grandad? What's wrong? Get him out of here. Get him out. Let him die. None of this will matter tomorrow. Shut him up! Shut up! I'm calling the police! Hang on! Wait! You... come with me. I told you! He's crazy. I want him out of here. Hear me? Let them talk, let's go. Since mum died standing up for you is impossible. All of this junk... The rooftop... What you said out there... What's going on, dad? Tell me, would you? Tell me what you're doing. Dad. Dad, please... What's going on with you, dad? Now we can talk. Okay. I'm listening. They've been watching us for quite some time. I know it's hard to believe, but I've been talking to them for a while. With them? Who? The voices. They communicate with me in many ways. Sometimes through the radio, the static noise under the music, the magnetic waves. Sometimes I hear them in the wardrobe. And if I listen carefully, I can hear them behind the mirror. I see their shadows in the reflection. In my dreams. I know how it looks. I'm not an idiot. If you heard them, you'd understand too. I can hear everything clearer now. Now... I'm strong enough to do it. Do what? It took me a while, but at last I understand. We have to do it ourselves. If we don't work together, we'll all die. This way, we have a chance. I'm sorry. But it's unavoidable, son. Are you serious? For God's sake, dad. Lena's about to call the police. They spoke to your mum too. But she... never gave in to anybody. Listen to me, dad. Please. Please. I'm sure that those voices seem real to you, but I promise they're not. You need help and we're getting it. You've never listened to us. It's too late now. That's enough! Nobody's talking to you! Nobody's listening to you! Understand? Look! Nothing's watching you. It's just you. Look! Look. You. This. That's it. This room, this bed. Life. That's all there is. That's it. Dad, listen to me. Please. You don't understand, do you? - Dad... - It's already happening. Dad... You're leaving me no other option. You're proving Lena right. I've already lost mum, I don't want to lose you now. They told me... that they can bring her back. You know? They might bring your wife back too. No, dad. No... Naia, wait for me! - We'll wait for you here. - No. We'll see you at home. We'll tell you about it then. I'm sorry. We can't take Manuel yet. RETIREMENT HOME "PARADISE" We need you to take him today. Impossible. As I told you, a place will come up soon but it could be in a few days or in a few weeks. Don't you understand, he's dangerous. He threatened to kill us. I know... Sometimes it's threats, sometimes it's incontinence... - Are you listening? - Urinary incontinence... Disorientation... Old age. I told you, there's nothing wrong with him. Try to use these days to say goodbye. Show him lots of love, he'll appreciate it. In the meantime, I'll get him registered. Okay? It was a pleasure to meet you. We might not meet again, I'm retiring next week. This is what I've been saying to people for years: "Welcome to Paradise". We'll lock him in his room until we can bring him here. We need to look after him. He's sick, that's all. - Where are you going? - To the toilet. Don't look at them. Do you hear them? Do you hear them? Do you hear them? Naia, wait. Let's talk. What did they say? What do you think? They are only taken to that prision to die. Lower your voice, damn it. Sweetie, it's best for your grandad and for us. We can visit whenever we want. So you're giving in? You'll let your dad rot in there? You're that much of a bastard? What's another death in the family? Like grandma. Like mum! You think I don't miss your mum? Every day. Every second of my fucking life. I can't do anything. Nothing. Naia. Naia. They'll lock him up at home and then at the nursing home to die Jota, we have to do something. Calm down. Listen. When did he say he's... Tonight? Yes. Okay. I've got an idea. Jota? Where are you going? Send me the location. I'll be right there. DOUBLE MURDER IN GIJÓN ELDERLY PEOPLE DIE IN FIRE STARTED BY THEIR SON I'll go to the store room. See if there's a padlock. Don't be long, please. What have you done? Mario. Hello? Hello? Sorry... Are you okay? My face spins around. What? Sometimes... when it's night-time and nobody's looking, it falls off. And then... I feel stronger. Forgive me. Lately, my husband hasn't been feeling well. Let's go home. Come on. Fucking old people. Come on, get going. Come on. Come on. You'll fall. Get in! It's freezing! Please! It'll cool you down. Turn around. Come on... Further around. So, we look after you... and you want to kill us. Turn around again. What's that? Let me see? What is that? Let me see. What's that? Let me see. Hey, let go of me. Manuel, let me go. You're hurting me. You're hurting me, let go! Let go of me. Let go! Careful with the baby. You wouldn't want to lose it. Listen to me, you bastard. I'm not like Rosa. It won't work with me. 119,84 ºF 121,82 ºF Open up, that's it. They'll make you feel better. That's right. Here. Dad. Did you really hit Lena? Dad. I need to know. Come on, dad. Get some rest. It's going to be the hottest day on record. I'll put the air-con on. Mario. Lock him in or I'm leaving. You lock him in. I'm off to the bar. I need some air. Is that you, Naia? GRANDAD'S WITH ME He has to be gone tomorrow, my folks will be back. No problem. - Naia! - Get going. - Where are you going? - It'll be fine, right? Don't you start... Naia! Naia! MISSING Lena's calling again. Hey, a film from your time. Seen it? Want to know why I'm called Jota? Massive electrical storms are also happening beyond our peninsula. According to our sources... - No way. - It's a global phenomenon. - What are you doing here? - Experts assure us... - No homes to go to? - climate change is to blame for these unusual phenomena. 123,08 ºF 123,26 ºF - Jota. - What? - Where's my grandad? - Shit... How long have you been asleep? - No idea... - Fuck. Where are my keys? Jota, where are they? Where are they? They're calling you. What next? - What is it, Lena? - Dad! Can you hear me? Naia? Dad, grandad's gone and we can't find him! Naia? Can you hear me? - Hello? - Dad! He has house keys. - Naia? - He has... keys... It's the end of the world, mate. The storms... My 92-year-old mum has been saying she's going to kill us all tonight. We're all fucked. Lena? Dad? Are you there? Naia! Lena! Dad... Lena. Lena. Lena. Dad! Dad! Get out. Naia. Get out! No! - Get out! - No, dad! Go on! Get her out of here! No! - Get off me! - Naia, don't! Dad! - I have to go back. - No, no, no... What are you doing? - Dad! - Calm down! Look at me! Look at me. Calm down, okay? Shit. We need to get help. No, no, no... Jota, where are you going? Quickly. Open up. Open up! Come on! Open! Dad! - They're not here! - Fuck. Dad! Dad! Dad! No! Naia. We have to go. Dad... Come on. We can't stay here. Come on. No, no, no! No, no, no! Don't move. Close your eyes. Your grandma's on her way.
