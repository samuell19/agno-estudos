"The green grass glistened with morning dew as Bertram held Geraldine in his strong arms ..." If you cannot contain yourselves, I shall cease to read on. Oh, go on! We promise to be good. That's better. Hello! You look tired. Good walk? Wonderful. Mother thought reading books was the devil's work. Imagine what she'd think about writing them. Now Marilla, you know Anne always puts a moral in her stories, and romance. Nothing wrong with that. Fact is, I kind of like 'em. "Together they surveyed a smashed-up coupé..." What's a coupé? It's a kind of carriage. It sounds French. It is French, Ruby. They're petite noblesse. "'Oh, Mr. Devere - Bertram - you may have saved my life, but I fear my heart will never recover,' said Geraldine, between gasps. 'Tis not your heart, Geraldine, but our love that ails you.' Then falling to his knees in the churned soil, he produced a diamond ring." "'Will you take me as yours, and give me your own thy self?'" That's not done nowadays. What? Well, men don't get down on their knees to propose. Oh, Ruby, I imagined a world where they did. But I - Ruby, don't be so the, the way you are. "Her marble bosom heaved in the moonlight." Oh, that's so romantic! For the ending, I imagined Cordelia was secretly in love with Bertram, and when Geraldine told her about the engagement, she was furious - especially when she saw the necklace and diamond ring. And all of her affection for Geraldine turned into bitter hatred, and she vowed she would never marry Bertram. And she pretended to be friends with Geraldine, just the same as ever. Then one evening they were standing on a bridge over a turbulent stream, and thinking they were alone, Cordelia pushed her right over the brink with a wild, mocking "Ha-ha-ha!" But Bertram saw the entire thing, and he plunged right into the water, proclaiming, "I will save thee, my Geraldine!" But alas, he forgot he couldn't swim, and they both drowned, clasped in each other's arms. I don't know how you can make up such stories out of your own head. It's all about cultivating your imagination. You can do it, too, if you put your mind to it. Oh, it's too late for me. What do you mean? I just, I don't think of those things. What do you think about? Ruby Gillis says she means to have a beau by the time she's seventeen. Ruby Gillis ought to. She's got a case of... Well, I'm not going to say anything uncharitable. I think you and I should take an oath that we'll never marry, but be nice old maids for the rest of our lives, and live together forever. Oh, not old. Never old. Let's be this age, and stay in Avonlea forever. As Minnie always says, I agree with that. Slowpoke! Is a snail your sister? Get down here! Your porridge is getting cold. Coming, Marilla! Oh, finally! Well, the flounce on that dress makes you look even taller. It was kind of you to add it, Marilla, even though it's not very sensible. Well, I'm not about to have the likes of Josie Pye making remarks about the state of your clothes. She's always tops and no taters, that one. Matthew! Sit down! Come have your porridge. Diana's waiting for me. May I skip it? Skip breakfast, the most important meal of the day? Not likely! The last time you tried that you nearly drowned yourself. That wasn't because I missed breakfast. Mm-hmm. It's funny. I don't feel any older, but I suppose I am. It's a serious thing, growing up. I'm not sure I'm going to like it. Excuse me, Miss Anne. I picked up a little something for you in town last week. You might be able to use them at school. Oh, Matthew! You always know how to cheer me up! Oh, now. Thank you. Marilla, may I go? As long as you don't run. Mind the puddle! She may be fourteen; there's still quite a lot of the child in that girl yet. My goodness! Gilbert's certainly grown over the summer. Oh, isn't it time to bury the hatchet between you two? I suppose. Hello, Diana. Hello, Ruby. Jane, that's a pretty dress. Thank you, Gilbert. Gilbert Blythe. What have you been up to all summer? Camp in Ontario. There's canoeing, and archery. You see, that's what happens when I try to be nice. Now, don't all crowd me! Now, you can all have a turn with it later. Yes, alright Jeremy, you can ring the bell. Lilian, don't touch the chain. You'll get your hands all dirty. I told you no good would come from hiring a woman teacher. Oh, Rachel, stop fussing! A bicycle! What next, a motorcar? That'll be the day! And she's got them reading Latin. Latin! Why, it's the next thing over from Italian. Well, I'm sure no harm will come from that, either. Marilla Cuthbert, you're getting soft. That's what. By the way, have you heard anything at all about the Abbey Bank? Just what everyone's saying - that it's shaky. Every penny we have is tied up in that bank. Matthew won't hear a word about going anywhere else. Once he's made up his mind, trying to turn him is like trying to turn the wind. That's a man for you. And that's another thing - she's got them doing something called "physical exercises." Girls and boys together. Shameful! This is an authentic pine wood paddle used by a coureur de bois. Runners of the woods. Each man's paddle was unique to him, and if he perished on the river, it also served to mark his grave. Who wants to learn the traditional paddling technique of the trappers? Anne Shirley, s'il vous plait? Grip the handle here, and here. The coureurs used smooth and steady movements. Arms straight, reaching out and drawing as much of the water over their blades as possible. Bien, bien, Mademoiselle Shirley! Mais, the coureurs never travelled alone. Who will be Anne's faithful partner? I will! Choose me, please! Monsieur Blythe, mon ami, veuillez-vous? A little closer, please. S'il vous plait. Now then. Anne, Gilbert, on my mark. Un, deux, trois, un, deux, trois, un, deux, trois... Do you mind trading sides? Un, deux, trois, un, deux, trois, un, deux, trois. ♪ Aloutte, je te plumerai ♪ ♪ Aloutte, gentille Aloutte ♪ ♪ Alouette, je te plumerai. Je te plumerai la tête ♪ ♪ Je te plumerai la tête. Et la tête, et la tte ♪ ♪ Aloutte! Aloutte! Oh! Euclid of Alexandria was known as the father of geometry. His genius was in reducing the things we know for sure down to five distinct axioms. First, a straight line can be drawn between any two points. Second... A circle with any radius can be drawn around any point, and Anne Shirley, what are you doing? Please see me after class. Fourth, all right angles are equal. Fifth - Romance. You like romance, do you? Do you agree with the theme? Theme? Men prefer women who are aloof. That's what Ruby said. In my opinion, there's nothing wrong with telling the truth. But that's neither here nor there, and it's not the reason I asked you to stay behind. It's not? She wants to organize an after school class for her most advanced students who mean to take the exam for Queen's. And Miss Stacey says that if I get in, and work hard enough when I'm there, I may qualify myself to be a teacher! Anne? I've always wanted to be a teacher! I didn't even - Anne? Thank you for the world so sweet, thank you for the food we eat, thank you for the birds that sing, thank you, God, for everything. Oh, Marilla! It's always been my undying dream, my whole life, to be a teacher! Really? That's the first I've heard of it. Well, I didn't mention it before because I thought it would be perfectly useless. Oh, Matthew! Think of it! Queen's Academy in Charlottetown! Can you think of a more alluring place in the whole world? Charlottetown, eh? But I would suppose it'd be dreadfully expensive. Well, I don't suppose that's something you need to worry about. But, I do worry. Anne Shirley, when we took you in we resolved to give you a good education. I believe that a girl should be fit to earn a living, whether or not she ever has to. So there's an end to it. Enough said. Oh, Marilla, thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you! Oh, I will work as hard as I can, and I will try my best to be a good credit to you, though, do not expect too much in geometry; but I think I can hold my own in everything else if I work hard enough. Reckon you'll beat the whole island. Beat 'em all easy, you'll see. Diana! Diana! Anne, what's wrong? This is nothing short of a calamity! It's not me, Anne. It's my parents. They think it's a waste of money. I'll most likely get married and stay at home. But you don't have to be like that. My mother thinks so. Oh, I will curse her to my dying day if that - Oh, gosh! I didn't mean that. I know. Why Ruby Gillis instead of you? Miss Stacey says she's a walking abacus. Why Josie? Why, Diana? We've never been apart in anything! Remember what Mrs. Lynde said? When that calf died in birth, and even Matthew couldn't calm you down? I know, I know. We can't have perfect things in this imperfect world. She's not a very comforting woman. No doubt she has a lot of true things to say. Go be a scholar. Though I have tasted the bitterness of death, I shall endure. Good bye. Moody Spurgeon, please introduce yourself to the class. Class, please welcome your new fellow student. Hello, everyone. Welcome, Moody. Thank you, Moody. In every life there is a moment - one moment, never to be repeated - when after years of hearing grown ups tell you to grow up, you decide on your own to do it. You have been given the opportunity to try out for Queen's Academy, where you will study with the best and brightest of our province. But it won't be easy. The work will be harder than anything you have ever faced. It will require your dedication, sacrifice, and strength. But if you seize this opportunity - as I believe that all of you here can - then this will be your moment. The entrance exam is in two months. The time has come to set aside childish things. Gallia est omnis divisa. Gallia est omnis divisa in partes tres; quaram unam incolunt Belgae. Gallia est omnis divisa in partes tres quaram... Anne. Muscle. Muscle. M-U-S-C-L-E. Muscle. Gilbert. Confederation. Confederation. C-O-N-F-E-D-E-R-A-T-I-O-N. Confederation. Anne? Peony. Peony. P-I-O-N-Y. Peony. Gilbert. Quandary. Quandary. Q-U-A-N-D-R-Y. Quandary. Head rolls! And begin! And the other way! Open your jaw! Ahh. And the other way! And then move it! Really work it! And the hips! Release your hips! With mast, and helm, and pennon fair; That well had borne their part. But the noblest thing that perished there Was that young and faithful heart. What do you think, Harry? I agree. Memory like an elephant. I just hope your examiner is sitting in a sturdy chair. Give us another one. Anne, you're shaking. I can't help it. You know, this is tiddlywinks compared to the teacher's course. Josie, good luck to you, too. Good luck, Anne. You, too. Forty-nine, Moody! If you don't know it now, you never will. Good luck, Anne. Thank you, Moody. Good luck to you, too. Good morning. My name is Superintendent Williston. I will be the invigilator for today's examinations. Eyes front, backs straight, put your personal belongings away. Do not open, do not touch, do not look at the booklet until the starting bell. During the examination, do not look onto your neighbour's paper, or you will be excused. Do not talk or whisper or you will be excused. And if you need to be excused, you will be excused. Ready? Begin. I have a creepy, crawly feeling about the geometry. It was fiendishly hard! Well, now, I'm sure you did fine. Ruby Gillis says it was so easy a child of ten could do it. Moody Spurgeon says he thinks he failed history, Charlie says he failed algebra. But we don't fully know until the pass list is out, and that might be for another week, at least. Mm-hmm. I'd rather not pass at all than place lower than Gilb... Than I expected. You hear that? What is it? A bobolink. Sounds so cheerful. Joyous and irrepressible glee. Like you. Not always. Anne! Anne! What is it? Are you alright? Oh! Yes, yes, I'm fine. Only father was in Bright River, and he bought the paper. It's here. It's all here. The pass list? Diana, I can't bear it. What does it say? You passed! You passed first! You and Gilbert! You and Gilbert both! You tied! I'm going to Queen's? Yes, you silly goose! You're going to Queens! Marilla! Marilla, look! I passed! Everyone did, including Moody Spurgeon, although he's conditioned in history. And Ruby, and Jane, and Charlie. And Josie Pye just scraped through, although she'll put on as many airs as if she led. I knew you would do it. Well, I'd say you've done very well for yourself, hmm? Mind you keep your wits about you. I will. And remember before you cross the street you - Look both ways. Those cab drivers are impossible. I was nearly run over! I know. You told me. And don't talk to strangers. To strangers. Heaven knows what kind of odd folk you're going to find in a great big city like Charlottetown. Marilla. I'll be perfectly sensible. And do not skip - Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. No, this one I need to hear you promise out loud. I, Anne Shirley, solemnly promise not to skip breakfast. Right. Okay. Miss Anne, that train won't wait. Okay, enough lolly gagging. Off you go. I don't know how I'm going to fill my days now that Anne's off at Queen's, which is silly, of course. I've got my work at the Aid Society, and enough mending to last me through the winter, and Matthew . I know you think I was a fool for adopting that child, but for all the trouble she's brought into our lives, she's brought as much or more of sunshine. You know me. I'm not one of those people as can never be brought to own up they've made a mistake. Goes without saying. But just think, Marilla. If I had been right, she could have set the house on fire. What? I locked up every match in the house for the first week because of you. Mind you, an odder, unexpecteder witch of a child there never was. But she's turned out real well. Hmm. Yeah. She's a credit to the both of you's. I tried to make it cozy for the, Petal, but the whole town is bloody drafty like. Manky colonial construction. Neither use nor ornament. Happen a cup of brew, Petal? Thank you. Conny lass. There's naught it's good for but the grave, we say in Yorkshire. Yes, ma'am. Hast thou ever been to Yorkshire, love? No, ma'am. I hope to gradley God some day, the will! Thank you, ma'am. Dining room's at the foot of the stairs. There'll be a lovely hot cuppa waiting for the. ♪ Ah, my own bonnie lassie Oh, gosh. Don't you just love life in the city? I know I do. It's what I was born to - Oh, you've been crying? You really shouldn't rub like that. Your nose and eyes are all red. It's most unbecoming. Do you understand a single word that she says? ♪ When I look to yon high - Personally, I have no intention of being homesick. Charlottetown's far too jolly for that poky old Avonlea. I don't know how I stood it so long. Oh, gosh! I'm so hungry I could eat the bottom out of an iron pot. Mmm. In any event, I'm off to meet Jim Stockley later at the park. His parents are very well known in Charlottetown, and he's such a sport. He noticed you in class today. He asked me about you. I said that you were an orphan and that no one knew very much where you came from. Why, Josie, the stork brought me, just the same as you. Oh, Anne, I feel as it's been ages since morning. Hello, Josie. Your bedroom's so much bigger than mine. Mine's dreadful. These must be for us. I hope so. I'm famished! Have you been crying? Oh, do own up. It will restore my self respect. I was bawling my eyes out before Ruby came along. It's true. She was a regular waterworks. I don't mind being a goose if somebody else is a goose, too. Are you trying for the Avery? The Avery? The scholarship. Well, I don't know anything about that. It's a full scholarship to university. Anywhere the recipient wants to go. Jim Stockley's uncle is on the board of governors. In any event, Gilbert's sure to win it. And the gold medal. Who says? If hard work has anything to do with it, I'm going to win that scholarship. That's the spirit! Hear, hear! Barred owl. Great horn. Mm-hmm. Awful quiet, don't you think? You have a gift for stating the obvious. Remember when she cracked that slate over Gilbert Blythe's head? Hmm. Dreadful behaviour. What was it he called her? Carrots. Carrots. The vanity of that child. "I will not go back to school! My honour has been tarnished." A child of twelve! I will allow I'll get an awful lot more done around the house without her here. True. I hired that local handyman, George; what's his name? McMurrich. George McMurrich. Hmm. Well, I'm for bed. He's a good man. Yes, he is. He'll be a help around here. Yes, he will. You understand. Yes, I do. Good night. God bless. God bless. What room are you in? Twelve. I'm in twelve. I'm in room eight. With Moody? Just my luck. What room are you in, Anne? Dearest Diana, here it is Tuesday, and I'm writing this i Mrs. Periwinkle's boarding house. Mrs. Periwinkle is a queer type. She reminds me of Mrs. Lynde, but without the sturdy backbone and the Christian morals. Last night I was horribly lonesome all alone in my room, and wished so much I could look out my window and see the light from your window winking back a me. There are scores of students here from all over the Island, along with our little group from Avonlea. Josie Pye has begun to do her hair up, and she spends more time with boys than studying; letting them carry her satchel, and generally behaving like a silly person. Not that I am opposed to masculine friendship - if only to furnish broader standpoints of judgement and comparison. Still, I find much solace in my studies, and am pleased to count myself among the favourites for the Avery Prize, among others, whom I do not car to name. Yours devotedly, Anne. Don't forget to ask them about the interest rates. I won't, Marilla. You've made sure of that. Maybe they can tell us the reasons that our savings haven't done well since - Since February. I know. I'm not so slow I can't remember what you told me half an hour ago. And don't be put off by them talking down to you. It's your money. You have a right to know what they're doing with it. And being investigated for what exactly? That's what I'd like to know. Why don't you come in with me? Oh, me talk to a bank manager? Not likely! But you - No, it has to be a man. You'll do fine. Now, you're going to ask them about what? Interest rates. Off you go. Go on. Go on! Get in there. Oh! Matthew Cuthbert in Avonlea! My goodness! What a delightful surprise! Oh, well, I just thought I - Come in, come in. Marilla not with you? No, no. Huh. I see her at church and so on, but she's always so busy with one thing or another. Uh-huh. She's a busy one, alright. Well, come into my office. Let's have a chat. My father. Hmm. He used to always say, "If all men were as decent as the Cuthberts, we'd be out of business, boy." So... Is this a social visit, or are we talking business? Well, what I mean to say is Marilla and I wanted... Yes? To know about the interest rates. I beg your pardon? How are the interest rates? Fairly steady, all things considered. Good. That's good. Anything else you wanted to know? No, no. That's it. What am I going to do with you? Father said any bank run by an Abbey was good enough for anyone. Father was a good man, but he was not a wise investor. Oh, good morning, Marilla. My goodness, Matthew. You're mighty dressed up for a Tuesday. Hello, Rachel. You certainly have an eye for fashion. You weren't just coming from the Abbey Bank, were you? Sorry, Rachel. We don't have time to stay and talk. I'll see you later at the guild meeting. George McMurrich's working up at your house now. That's right, he is. And he's a very good man. Quiet! Which is a virtue. Quietest man I've ever known. Muriel! This morning it seemed that nothing was so important as exams, but out here it only seems half so important. It's all very well for you, Anne. You're sure to pass at least. Ruby, what do you mean? You'll do fine. Not unless I can distinguish between a dangling participle and a split infinitive. Oh, I've completely lost my appetite. Why worry? What's the use? At least it's something that I can do. It would be so dreadful to fail after spending so much money. I don't care. If I don't pass this year, I'll just come back next fall, because my father can afford it. By the way, Anne, Jim Stockley told me that Professor Tremaine told him that Gilbert is sure to win the Avery. Jim Stockley's certainly entitled to his opinion. Oh, boy. Jane? Just thinking about exams again. Josie, what are you wearing to the tea dance? Oh, I'll just probably pick something up from the shops. Everything here is so much nicer than at home. Would you look at that? My hand's shaking. I'm going to wear my lace gown with the low waist. It shows off my figure. What about you, Anne? What are you going to wear? Well, I don't know why they have this thing a week before exams. It's such a silly tradition. There's so much studying to do. You're not coming? Oh, but you must come, Anne. Or else I'll be the only one without a partner. Girls! Don't be so insensitive. Perhaps Anne just doesn't have a gown. Gilbert reminds me of Enrico Caruso, don't you think? And I'm the Queen of Romania. Who's Enrico Caruso? He's an opera singer. Jim Stockley played me a recording of him on his Victrola. Why isn't Jim here? He's, he's probably playing golf. He's absolutely crazy about golf. Gilbert's a really good dancer. He can make anyone look competent. Even you, Anne. I have the least desire to dance with Gilbert Blythe. Oh, but everyone dances with everyone. It's tradition. She probably wasn't taught that at the orphanage. I wish they'd play a waltz. It must be thrilling to be whirled around the dance floor by a man. There's no chance of that. Miss Elwood is a Methodist. Uh-oh, here they come. Alright, lads. Come on. Let's not be shy. Alright, let's get this over with. Hello, Anne. How is life with you? Do you know the steps? Nope. Neither do I. Sort of walk-bounce-walk. Walk-bouce-walk. Got it. Gosh, Ruby sure looks pretty today. Dogasted, Moody! Focus! Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. Change partners. I'll lead. Uh-huh. You're a fast learner. And... and... Change partners. Afternoon, Anne. Gilbert. Josie's been chasing me like I'm a chicken on the loose! How are you finding Cicero? Cicero? The Roman writer who ... I know who he was. Battle before passion. After all that makes me cross-eyed, and all the magistrates. What? What is it? Well, the magistrates list in De Legibus. I know. So what? So the exam is on the other book. I read the wrong book! Let go of me! I didn't mean to. No, you didn't mean to. You're just so competitive. Anne I thought we were past - You thought you could get the Avery by saving this from me from the last second. But I won't let that happen, Gilbert Blythe. What? Just you mark it. Oh, poor girl. Her nerves are all shaken up. Did you know that orphans are twice as likely to be criminals as regular folk? What? Dance with me! Nec vero habere virtutem satus est quasi artem alliquam nisi utare. Nec vero habere virtutem satus est quasi artem alliquam nisi utare. Nec vero habere virtutem satus est quasi artem alliquam nisi utare. Ave, imperator, morituri te salutant, ave, imperator, morituri te salutant. Ave, imperator, morituri... Scran's ready, Petal. Get thissen sat down. The examination will consist of five sections, each of which you will have exactly thirty minutes to complete. Talking to another student, looking at another student's desk, or leaving your own desk before the examination is complete will result in your immediate disqualification, and possibly expulsion from this Academy. And stop. Turn your papers over, and wait for them to be collected before exiting the hall in an orderly fashion. Chin up, lass. If the failed, the failed. Naught to be done about it. You ken what we say in Yorkshire - "Bow't it's always best when the's paid well for it." Here, now have a soss of brew. Well, the only certainty in life is that nothing is certain. Fine words from someone who was throwing up not two hours ago. "Fate leads him who follows it, and drags him who resists." What if you passed your exam, but forgot to write your name down? The only thing that matters is that we all did our best. The next thing to trying and winning, the best thing is trying and failing. Do you really believe that, Anne? If I say it enough times I think I will. Anne? I can't. Can't what? March up to that bulletin board with everybody looking there. Can you go? You go look at it and come back and tell me. If I failed, just say it really quickly, and do not try and soften it at all. And whatever you do, do not sympathize with me. Promise me that! I can promise that. Anne, isn't it splendid? Anne, I'm so proud! About what? Gilbert won the gold medal, but you won the Avery! I did? Yes! Are you sure? As sure as I was the last time you asked me. What about the colour? When did you become so vain? Matthew, Rachel says that the Abbey Bank is shakier than ever, and if something should happen to it, we stand to lose Green Gables, and get nothing in return. Rachel says! You know what a gossip she is. And what could she possibly know about banking? Nothing! And nothing's going to happen. Fine, but what if it does? We are not selling this place. We cannot hang onto this place forever. I would rather die in a harness than some old folks home in town! There'll be no more talk about selling Green Gables. Ever! I can see that. Matthew? I'm alright, Marilla. Maybe we shouldn't go. Nothing on God's green earth is going to stop me from going to Anne's graduation. Well, then why don't I drive? Imagine what Rachel Lynde would have to say about that! No, no, Marilla, let's shake a leg. We can't miss Anne's speech. Up you go. Education. What do we mean by education? From the Latin educat - led out. From the verb educare - to lead out. And so we see that to be educated is to be led, as well as to learn. Learn. From the Old English, leornian, which also means, to teach. Reckon I heard Harry make a better speech. And now a few words from this year's Avery Scholar, Anne Shirley. Mr. President, my fellow students, stunned as an owl is how I fell today, winning this award, for which I'm most grateful. I've been so lucky, but my greatest piece of luck in my whole entire life was coming to Prince Edward Island. I'd say we were the lucky ones. Look at that moon! Polished to the Queen's own taste, as they say. Home. Charlottetown was wonderful, but oh, I'm so happy to be back! I missed the smell of the leaves and the ocean. So different here. And Green Gables. Who's that? George McMurrich. He's helping out around the place. Since I left they had to. It's a good thing they did. You know how I feel? I bet you'll tell me. I can be studious and ambitious, but right now... I feel as lazy as a pet pig. I just want to lie around and do nothing. Tell me all the news! Don't leave out anything. Oh, I don't think a woman of the world like yourself would be interested in what we country bumpkins have been up to. Dogasted, woman! Fine language for a lady! Well, since you're so keen to know the gossip, Mrs. Allan dropped by unexpectedly last week, and there was no cake in the house for tea. Your poor mother. Oh, I don't think she'll survive. Frank Wright has been walking me home from meetings on Sundays. You sly fox! You didn't mention it in your letters! Well, I never thought anything of it, but last week he gave me a pencil case. A pencil case? You're practically engaged! Oh, no! Anne, don't say that! I could ever imagine being engaged. Okay, maybe I can. Did you hear? Jane already has a school in Newbridge. I thought they'd give her the school at Avonlea. Haven't you heard? What? About Gilbert. You know I don't care a whit about - He's going to be teaching there. Where? In Avonlea. What? Josie Pye told me this morning. But he won the gold medal. He could go anywhere, do anything. Why would he stay here in Avonlea? His father can't afford to send him to university. He means to earn his way through teaching. That's rotten unfair. I thought you didn't have time for Gilbert Blythe. I... Anne? No. No, no, no. No time at all. Marilla? Mm-hmm? How's Matthew? What do you mean? Well, he just seems not so well. Well, he's had a few spells with his heart this spring, but he won't spare himself a mite. Maybe now that you're here he'll take it easier on himself. And how are you? I'm fine. Well, my eyes are bothering me a bit, but there's a new eye doctor in town. I've made myself an appointment. If you want to make yourself useful, why don't you go out there and help Matthew put Harry to bed, hmm? Mind the puddle! You're very quiet, Miss Anne. Am I? Time was you'd be chattering away. Make me dizzy with all your questions. I suppose it's because I'm just so happy. Isn't the fog magical? Like the old folks used to say, a mantle of mystery. Of course, now I'm one of the old folks. Remember when I first came to Green Gables? My memory may be fading, but that's not a day I'll ever forget. I can still see Marilla's face when she found out I wasn't a boy. I've never seen her so speechless before or since. Night, Harry. I sometimes think if I'd been born a boy I'd be more of a help to you. Spare you a hundred ways. Well, I guess it wasn't a boy that took that prize, was it? No, no. It was a girl, our girl, and we're very proud of her. Here, now. You see this? Scotch rose. It is, indeed. And you know, our dear mother first planted this when she came here. She was homesick as all get out, and these roses were a comfort to her.

Matthew Cuthbert, of Green Gables... May the road rise up to meet you, may the wind be always at your back. May the sun shine warm upon your face, the rains soft upon your fields and until we meet again, may God hold you in the palm of his hand. May the blessing of the rains be on you. May it beat down upon your spirit, and wash it fair and clean, and leave there a shining pool where the blue of Heaven shines. It was a lovely service, Pastor. Thank you. But frankly it's easy to say kind words about a truly lovely man. Yes, indeed. Indeed. Have you seen Marilla? Come to think of it, no. Gilbert? Thank you. For what? Being here. I liked Mr. Cuthbert very much. He was shy. Sort of like me. Marilla? Do you really think that you should be... Now what about your hired man in there? Oh, George McMurrich! Not so quiet when it comes to talking about Matthew, is he? Did you hear him say Matthew is the most religious man he ever met? My Matthew! Can you imagine that? Well, no, I can't at that. But I can imagine that Matthew wouldn't want you in here catching your own death. Life goes on. I could be an ordinary neighbour to Matthew. But I loved that man. And so did you. Goes without saying. Come on. Let's go inside. Anne? Thank you for all your help. So very kind. Oh, it's nothing, really. We don't know what happiness is until it's taken away. Would you like me to sleep here with you tonight? I don't mind. Would you understand if I'd prefer to be alone? I suppose. When I saw him in the coffin I cried my eyes out. Since then I've been completely tearless. I just have this, this long, dull ache, and I know there's so many tears left inside me. And to find them I just need to be quiet and alone. I understand. Really, I do. Gracious Heavenly Father, it's me, Anne Shirley. You probably already know what I'm going to say. Normally I'm really good with prayers. It's Matthew. It's Matthew. Yes? Oh, Anne. Anne. Don't cry so. It won't bring him back. What are we going to do? How will we go on without him? We have each other. It's never been easy for me to say things from my heart. Anne, I know I can be harsh with you sometimes, but you must know I love you as dear as my own flesh and blood. You've been my comfort and my joy ever since you first came to Green Gables. There, there. It'll be alright. We'll be alright. Um, "attack, they seemed to yield to the weight of the Roman power..." Good. Next. They "They marched something something." Uh, tropics, but... climate invaders. Good. Next. "Europe... was of course scarred, scared, scarcely!" Miss Marilla Cuthbert! Yes? How do you do? My name is John Sadler. I'm new in town. I'm just getting to know the place. And my sympathies on the passing of your brother. Thank you. After all these years together. It must be terribly lonely. Yes, sir, a farm can be a terrible burden. Can I help you with something, Mr. Sadler? Well now, ma'am, I think I might be able to help you. What did he say? Who? Oh, the oculist! Well, he said if I give up sewing and reading entirely, and any kind of work that strains my eyes at all, and I wear glasses all the time, that my eyesight might not get any worse, and my headaches might be cured. Well, that's good news, isn't it? But if I don't do exactly as he says, I stand to lose my eyesight entirely within six months. Marilla, he's given you hope. Hope! If you're careful you won't lose your eyesight, and if you wear glasses then your headaches will be cured. I won't be able to read, or sew, or... Well, no point in carrying on about it. If you'd make me another pot of tea I'd appreciate it. Anne Shirley, don't tell anybody about this. I couldn't bear people coming around sympathizing with me. Yuck. I won't. I won't. I won't. Well, Matthew Cuthbert, I don't mind telling you I'm a bit cross with you. You don't know why! I'll tell you why! You're unshakable faith in the Abbey Bank that's caused all this... I know, I know, no point crying over... Just get on with it. But if you have any really good ideas, please let me know. You'd be proud of our Anne. She misses you but she's bearing up. Miss Stacey! Miss Stacey! I thought you went to Montreal! I came back to pick up the rest of my books. I'm so sorry to hear about Matthew. The world without him in it... I can't seem to get used to it. I don't think one ever does. It feels as if my carefree youth is over. Of course. But it won't always. I promise. There's so many great adventures still to come. Right around the corner. Out of sight. Have you decided where you're going? Oh, I supposed Redmond. Redmond? In Halifax? It's close enough that I can come back for weekends if I need to. Anne, you have an exceptional talent. You know that, don't you? I have imagination. Nothing else. Imagination is a God given gift. And don't you think Matthew would have wanted you to use it to the fullest? With the scholarship, you can go anywhere you'd like. Toronto, Montreal, even New York if you'd a mind to. Imagine the possibilities, the art, the music, the people. It's a momentous decision you're making. One that could affect the rest of your life. But there, you're a sensible girl. I know you will make the right choice. Anne Shirley! What on earth are you doing up there? It's alright, Marilla. Well, come on down. You're going to break your neck! Don't worry. Matthew showed me how. Well, Matthew didn't have much sense, either. Pound of nails, bag of grass seeds, new axe, and flap. Thank you. Hello, Anne. Hello, Josie. My, you look lovely. Thank you. I was really sorry to hear about your guardian. You must miss him terribly. Thank you, Josie. That's, that's very kind. That black shawl makes your hair red, like it used to be. Is that the effect that you're going for? No, but thank you for pointing it out. Will you excuse me? Mr. Williston? I'm Anne Shirley. I'm sorry. Do I know you? No, but I know you're the school superintendent. I was wondering, could I talk to you for a moment? In private? Oh, well I, I don't usually... It's important. Hello, can I help you? Hi, young lady. Is Miss Cuthbert at home? Whom may I ask is calling? John Sadler is whom I am. Oh, don't mind me. I'm just taking some measurements. Prior to purchasing the property. Purchasing? Yeah, well, to be honest, the place does need a lot of work. Marilla? Marilla. Hello, Miss Cuthbert. Marilla, you didn't talk to him about selling Green Gables, did you? Oh, you can't be serious! Now, now youngster, you should let the old lady make up her own mind! Pardon me, Mr. Sadler, but this is a private conversation. You can see for yourself I can't possibly stay here with all the trouble, how lonely it would be - You won't stay here alone. I'll be with you! No, what? I'm not going to Redmond. What? I saw the school superintendent, and he told me I could teach in Carmody. There's a position. Isn't that wonderful? No, no, no, no, no. It's already decided! It's only a drive away, and then I can be back in time for supper, and then I can read to you, and keep you cheered up. Anne, I cannot let you make that sacrifice. Sacrifice? There is no sacrifice! Nothing would be worse than losing Green Gables! Nothing would hurt me more. Go away! Your Miss, Miss Cuthbert and I had a verbal agreement. Please leave. I'd hate to have to bring the law into this. Go ahead. But in the meantime please vacate the property, or I'm going to have to take the shotgun from over the fireplace. Shotgun? Well, I said it was a lovely gift, and I was ever so grateful, but I was far too afraid to actually ride it. So mother said it should go to you. Oh, yes. I'd love to borrow it. Oh, not to borrow. To keep. Really? Yes, really. You must show me how. Start like this, feet on both sides. That's it. Well, you can bring it with you when you go to university next term. I'm not going. What? You're not - I've got plenty to do at Green Gables. But what about your ambitions? My only ambition at the moment is to ride this contraption. Okay. Now... Right. Push! Woo! Oh, be careful, Anne! Be careful! Woo! Mr. Sadler was fair put out by Anne chasing him off the property. Said she was a demon child. Anne! I'm glad to hear you're giving up your idea of going to university. I don't believe in girls going to university with the men, cramming their heads full of Latin, and Greek, and all that nonsense. I'm going to study Latin and Greek just the same. I'm going to teach during the day and study for my Arts course at night. Anne Shirley, you are a right caution! Well, speaking of teaching, I saw Gilbert Blythe and his father in town the other day. Hmm. Anne, do you know the story of Marilla and John Blythe? Rachel, stop it. What's the story, Mrs. Lynde? Rachel. They used to be beaux. Oh, that's just what people called us. You were thick as thieves, you two. Well, I suppose we were, at that. What happened? Oh, I don't know. We quarrelled. About what? I don't even know. Can't remember. But he was proud, I was proud, and that was the end of that. You needn't look so surprised, young lady, at the thought of Marilla Cuthbert having a bit of romance! You can never tell about people from the outsides, and don't you forget it. Oh, speaking of Gilbert, he told me he's resigned his teaching post over in Avonlea. Imagine that. What? Apparently he got a job offer over in White Sands. Excuse me? Is there anything for me? Oh, um, yes. Just some textbooks is all. Must be pretty dreary stuff. No, actually. Hmm? Never mind. What's that you're reading? It's a novel, dear. Would you believe it's all about Cavendish? Cavendish down the road? Yes! Written by a local woman. All about the funny people living there. Mind you, I could write a book, the things I've seen. Scandalize the Christian world. I'm sure. Can I help you with that? Oh, no, thank you. Please let me. I can manage fine on my own, thanks. Lord, you are a stubborn one, Anne Shirley. Oh, I'm the stubborn one? What do you mean? You know exactly what I mean. I swear, I don't. I don't care to discuss it. You've made your decision, and that's that. Though it's only cutting off your nose to spite your face, as Marilla would say. What are you talking about? Taking a teaching post at White Sands. I suppose you couldn't get far enough away from me once you heard I was staying at Green Gables. Is that what you think? That I took the job at White Sands to get away from you? Don't pretend it isn't true. You do have a high opinion of yourself, Miss Shirley. And I suppose you're the soul of modesty? Anne, I took the other job so that you could have the job in Avonlea. What? So you wouldn't have to drive so far, and could be at home with Marilla. That's the truth. The trustees have agreed to offer it to you. Believe it or not, it doesn't matter to me. Well, it's time for me to be off. Give my best to Marilla. Gilbert. Yes? I've been an awful fool. I won't argue with you there. I let my pride get the better of me once again. I wish to formally apologize. I don't believe my ears. Anne Shirley, apologizing? Is the sky about to fall? It's time we buried the hatchet. I agree. That day on Miller's Creek, when you snagged me out of a tree. I was perfectly awful, wasn't I? Well, when you mention it like that, I mean - I can explain what happened, but it wouldn't make sense to you. Because I'm a dunce? No, because you're... Well, well, just because. I suppose I'm guilty of a certain stubborn pride, as well. I guess we've cheated fate long enough. What do you mean? We were born to be good friends, don't you think? Father says White Sands is a lot different. I don't know if he's right or not. My, my, my. Smell that? Cedar. More like fence posts. Look at the moon. Polished, to the Queen's own taste. Funny. I was just going to say. Don't think I've ever seen you and Gilbert Blythe talk for so long. Must have been an hour. It was that long? Hmm. I suppose it was. We have five years of conversation to catch up on. There's still so much more to discuss. Why don't you go in and wash up for supper? Alright. Look at the moon. Polished, to the Queen's own taste. Funny, I was just going to say. Say what? Doesn't matter. Anne, you were thinking something just then. Well, yes. Is that so odd? Only if you don't say it out loud. I was just thinking... I was thinking it's a dear old world, and I'm glad to be alive in it. So am I. Matthew, I don't really know what to say. But I think... I think God is in Heaven, and all is right with the world.
