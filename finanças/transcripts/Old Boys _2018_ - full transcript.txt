VIRILITER AGE ACT MANFULLY CALDERMOUNT COLLEGE MOTTO A breathless moment as he clears the last man with some truly dazzling footwork. The rule book lies in tatters. This boy has the grace of a jungle cat. A maverick. A dark horse. His mane blindingly bright in the stream today. This phoenix, risen from the ashes of an academic scholarship is about to carve his name into the history books of Caldermount. In your dreams, charity case. Sit down, freak. OLD BOYS Jeffreys. - Audley. - Yes ! Robinson. - Birtles. - Banham. Aitken. Dale Harris. Aitken. Howard. Huxley. Dear father, haven't heard from you in a while, so just a quick update from the front. Montague. Bingham. Bratby. This week I trialled for Streamers. Boothe. Johnson. It went well, actually. Vickers, the head boy, and Winchester are captains. Er, Gunderson. Everyone wants to be on Winchester's team. No, you, Noodle. It's Amberson, actually. But don't worry, it's only been four years. Fortunately, Winch is a close personal friend of mine. Streamers, gentlemen. The tourney of kings. Why do you want to play for the Founders XI ? Greatness, sir ! You sound like a pack of desk wallahs. Is that what you want to become ? Some pen-pushing wet dream in a suburban semi ? Like Amberson's dad. Why do you want to play for the Founders XI ? Greatness, sir ! Let the trials begin. Theirs is not to reason why Theirs is but to do and die - Yeah ! - Yeah ! Did I tell you about Streamers ? It's only played at Caldermount and has been for three hundred years. Strange it hasn't caught on because it's so much fun. Little Gidding. A real intellectual game, actually. A real battle of the wits. It's like playing chess. And away, German bite. Baby's coming. There's the boy. Winchester's the best by a country mile. He's got about thirty relatives up on the captain's honours board so he was literally born to play this game. Obviously, the Ambersons aren't up on the honours board... Yet. I may need a mouth guard. Jackhammer good. To score, you have to climb up on to a wall and hit a tree stump with the Streamers ball which, being square, is technically not a ball because, you know. Now I get it. Caldermount's not about thinking, it's about the boast. It's about earning your place in the history books. Boast possible. And today I did just that. Boast in flight. Boast ! Touch it down ! Touch it down ! Touch it down ! Touch it down ! Boast dead. You may think you were being quote unquote 'subversive'... I was drowning, sir. And what better way to destroy a grand old tradition than with your death ? I should take you straight to the Headman. - Please don't, sir. - Now I understand, Amberson. You're a minnow in this magnificent pond. - And Caldermount is sink or swim. - Minnows can swim, sir. Well let's say you're a crippled minnow. What do you do ? Allow yourself to drown, or hold up your wee gammy fin to a kindly salmon. Er, sorry, you're the salmon ? Note my manly frankness, Amberson. My dignified carriage and my doughty upper lip. Model yourself on me and you won't go wrong. Yes, sir. Half rations. Bucket run. Play up, play up and play the game. You'll thank me for this. Yes, sir. And smile, Amberson. These are the best days of your life. Lovely shot. Birdie. Fill her up. Back by seven. Pleb ! Drat. VIRILITER AGE You idiot ! Can't you look where you're going ? I can't believe it ! These boxes are huge ! You should've seen them ! I'm sorry... Is there someone I can call ? Someone at the hospital ? You're French. How do I contact your carer ? Er, no, no. I'm not ill. No ? You look like you wet yourself. - Are you dangerous ? - No, I'm a public school boy. Amberson. I'm helping you up. Cool. How can... I come to your aid ? You could carry that. Roger that. And then... One, two, three. Oh my God... What do you keep in this thing ? You must really love this book. My father wrote it. No, no, no, no ! I'd rather die ! That school wants me to dress like Batman ! If you're Batman, then Gotham is really in the shit. Pack up ! We're going. - Dad ! - What ? When you finish your book, then we can go. - But now you need that job. - No, I don't need a job. I need money. And you know why ? Because of that harpy ! My mother is not a harpy. She left us, remember ? I mean I almost jumped out the window. Who's the deadbeat ? Has he wet himself ? Hello, Monsieur. My name is Amberson. My book ! Careful, these are first editions ! They're the only editions. That makes them even more valuable. 250 years ago, Sir Thomas Calder... The founder ! ...built his school on a few simple principles. - Sir Thomas... - The founder ! ...believed in team spirit. Loyalty. Discretion. Knowing when to dominate and knowing when to submit. You must remake the world in the Caldermount image. The founder ! Dunkirk. Agincourt. The Opium Wars. The Swan of Avon. India. Trains. Internal combustion. Caldermount. Viva Caldermount. The founder ! Founders Day. I think it's pretty bloody disgraceful. Celebrating that crook Caldermount. That's the Establishment, man. They're all gangsters. Good morning ! Good morning, Monsieur. My name is Monsieur Babinot. B-A-B-I-N-O-T. The 'T' is silent. You may sit down. As you may know, I'm replacing your last teacher, Mr Nobes. You... what did Mr Nobes teach you last ? Er, Saint-Exupery, monsieur. Saint-Exupery ? Excuse me. If you want to learn about a little thing called life, I suggest... I suggest you give yourselves a little dosage of Felix Martin. Now, would you be very careful with those books. Okay ? First editions. Careful. Careful, first editions. Is this curriculum, sir ? - Curriculum ? What is your name ? - Johnson. Now you open the book page one and start to translate. Jacques held the knife to the pawnbroker's throat... Go to hell. He whispered to the... To the whimpering pimp. Whimpering pimp. Right. Left, left, left right, left... The bad woman is a blonde horse ? The woman has blonde hair. Can't you read ? Oh, not really. Nobesy taught us frenetically, sir. He said if we nail the oral paper, we could flunk everything else and still get a C. Well it's just random noises, basically. - So he was a fraud ? - Absolutely. Always down the pub. We never really saw him. Well, show me then. And if it's good, maybe we can all go to the pub. Er, not together. I can't. I'm writing a book. You. Curled up in a ball in your middle class security you never ask yourself those questions without answers. You. No one shook you by the shoulders before it was too late. Now the clay... Now, the clay of which you were shaped has dried and has hardened and nothing in you will ever awaken the dormant ...musician... or the poet or the astronomer that possibly inhabited you. You just have to give me the boxes. Alright. Go, go ! Well, boys... Silence ! So, phonetics. If she's looking for action, she's come to the right place. I'm just saying, women prefer a Roger Moore to a Sean Connery. Mum says I'm extremely charming. French girls are famously filthy. Zero moral fibre. They all have cats but you're not allowed to touch them unless you buy them dinner. If she's not Rosa Luxembourg, I'm not interested. My money's on Winchester every day. Amberson ? Amberson ? Your old man's on the blower. - Dad ? - Come to my house at midnight. I need to see you. Who is this ? Good evening, Agnes. Two camparis, please. Bollocks. Why didn't you come last night ? I waited for you. Don't run away from me. - I've gotta get back by seven. - One minute. - What do you want with me ? - You're a nice guy. Nice ? No, no, no. Er, don't you bel... I'm a bloody... Okay. Look... Back in Nantes, I knew a lot of boys. They all wanted to play games. They tried to be macho or so clever, and I thought "Oh, fuck off, you're all so empty", you know ? I mean, I feel the same way... About, um, girls, obviously. I wanted to travel, but my father says "Don't leave me alone, without you I can't work". He is writing another book ? He's been writing the same book for eighteen years. It drove my mother crazy. And now he has to finish it because it's the only way he can move on. So, I come here to help him, and now I'm his fucking maid. I cook, clean, pick up his underwear. And there is nothing here. Oh my God, there is no theatre, no library. The library. I'm angry and I'm bored. And I can't say how I feel, because there is no-one to talk to. And then this happens. You see someone and it's like, maybe they understand ? I know the feeling. Maybe he's going through the same shit ? He probably is. - You can't get him out of your head. - Why fight it ? Then you realise you like him. I... Are you... Will you give this to him ? Him ? The poet. Tall, handsome. Winchester ? Halt ! Don't move ! Freeze ! I said freeze ! Move ! Bogey in the red zone. Bogey in the red zone. This is not a drill. - What have you got there, boy ? - It's for Winchester, sir. Better give it to him then. Get down on your fucking knees or, so help me God... ! Right. So, you can't just threaten me with a wooden gun. Good shot, Lance Corporal. Are you cognisant with the dire consequences of wasting my damn time ? I have something for Winchester. - Can you referee a wrestling bout ? - You're joking ? - Does he look like he's joking ? - I'm not altogether familiar with... Ah, well then you'll have to compete. Come on. Go on, fight back. Come on, Noodle. - Come on. - Alright, guys. Winchester, I've got a parcel... - Flip him. - ...from the girl. The French beak's daughter. You bloody hoondog. Classic Winch. - Guys, please. - All bets are off... naturellement. Come on, Birtles. Come on, let's tell the others. He's pulled a bird. I repeat, Winchester has pulled a bird. So, this... lady ? - Agnes. She gave this to me. - To you ? To give to you. - To me ? - To you. - Why ? - I think she likes you. - Me ? - You. - Why ? - I have no idea. Hang on. Is it a porno ? No, it's almost certainly not a porno. I SWORE I'D NEVER TRY THIS AGAIN BUT YOU LOOK DIFFERENT WHAT HAVE YOU GOT ? What the hell was that ? I think that was a challenge. - You've got to reply to her. - No way. I can't do that. - I can help you. - I don't need your help. I'll blast her with my charm bazooka. - God, why did you have to tell them ? - Oh, I'm sorry. Look, let me help you. - Why ? What's in it for you ? - Nothing. That's fishy. My old man said, "Never become the victim of charity". I mean, I think he meant the NHS or tax or something. But the point is, let's make it a deal. Quid pro quo. You... you must want something ? Audley. Oh, I'd like him to stop being... Stop being such a colossal prick ? - Deal. - Okay. Let's effing do it. That babe ain't gonna know what hit her. - Salud. - Go on, out. B team. How can the XI improve if they're sparring with a bunch of piss-poor jessies. Stream crunch, all of you. Sorry, sir... - ... do you mind if I ... - Come here, you old dog. Can I borrow Amberson ? - Amberson ? - Moving target. Classic Winch-hunter General. Amberson, you're excused. Go on, run. You've stopped. Why ? I got this for Christmas. When you need to enforce the offside trap, accept no substitute. - Cool. - Well you think that's cool ? Pere Noel put this in my stocking. It'll blow your effing mind. Pins in my face. It's my face. But it's pins. - Shall we, er... - Oh, yeah. - Let's get on with it. - I've brought you some cards. Great, yeah. Hustle up. And why, why don't you just write what you think ? Boom. There we go. There he is. I'm just gonna write... ... just gonna write what I think. What do I think ? My name is Henry Winchester but most people call me Winch. Or Winchy. Of the two, I prefer Winch. I'm Captain of cricket. I'm courteous and punctual. My hair is 100% natural. I once saw a ghost. FUCKIN BRILIANT ! - Pretty much nailed it. - Right. Okay. Can we, can we try it another way ? Yeah. Could you bring your hair down ? My hair's my signature look. Try and look pissed off. Just, just imagine going completely bald. Great, that's it. Now turn slightly. Right... First card. YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT I'VE GOT Perfect. Really that, that... that was great. So, so, so, so, um, so, have you, you've had girlfriends before ? Me ? The mighty Winch ? Er, yeah. Ish. I mean, I met a girl skiing once. You know the thing after the skiing ? I've never been skiing. You're joking ? That's just you being funny-peculiar, right ? Do you think I'm peculiar ? The apres-ski. What a shocker. I mean, she'd bang on about her family, her friends, her school, her clothes... her diet, her dog. Her feelings. Good God. I mean, power to her, I'm just not up to the job. YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT I'VE GOT I'VE GOT 1 YEAR LEFT ON MY SENTENCE I'M KEEPING MY HEAD DOWN DOING MY TIME BUT IF YOU SEND ME A CAKE WITH A FILE IN IT I'LL SEE YOU ON THE OUTSIDE At the bottom of a dead end street she stood, bitterness in her eyes, rage in her heart. She looked like a wolfhound but with a hint of otter. But he was too big hearted, his spirit too generous. No, he pitied her. She who thought she was a Karenina, she wasn't more than a Bovary ! - Are you done ? - Yes. You could make it shorter. I mean, I don't know... I get it, the guy doesn't like his ex-wife. But I want to know what he's going to do next. After that, he rescues the prostitutes. - Just like 'Opium Dimanche'. - It's not like 'Opium Dimanche' ! It's not set in the Bronx ! Why don't you try something new ? - Like what ? - Another story. I'll be back. You keep working. It's stupid, I'm nervous. He gave me this to give to you. Agnes ! I have an idea ! Hide. I'm coming back. I'm coming ! So what if my character were a cop ? But he breaks all the rules, he plays fast and loose... - What do you think ? - Yeah, it's great. You're not convinced. - What are you doing ? - Sorry, sorry. Oh, it's okay. It's just scenography, design. You are a set designer ? No. Well... there was a theatre with a learning job... - Apprenticeship ? - Yes. But it was in Berlin. - And that's a problem ? - I told you my father needs me. Er, no, I just... I mean, this, it... It's very interesting. It's like a doll's house. Is that a very stupid thing to say ? It's for 'A Doll's House'. The play. Play. Absolutely, yes. Absolutely, the play. Classic. - You never heard of it. - No, I have. It's about some dolls. 'A Doll's House' is about a woman who leaves her family because she can't be her... Agnes ? I think I know now. - Agnes ! - Yes ! It's a cop, who has to work with a partner. At the beginning, they don't get along, it doesn't work... But slowly, little by little, they become a super team. - It's genius. - Yeah, it's great. What are you doing ? You still want to go to Berlin ? I'm only telling you this because I love you... But to be an artist you need passion, of course. But you also need... Talent ? I'm not saying you don't have talent. I'm not saying that at all. Go to bed, we'll talk in the morning. Kiss, good night. Are you okay ? I'm getting used to it. Are you okay ? - See you. - Goodnight. Go easy on Amberson, will you. Just a bit. Hey, class traitor. It's a bomb. It's orange juice. Haven't you read the Anarchist's Cookbook ? I'm sending the PM a message: the revolution has begun. Morning, Winchy. Vickers. Dick. He's talking to you. Call me. 03163625. - I can't do it. - Of course you can. Maybe tell her that you didn't like the cake. - Why ? - I think they like being teased. - Your cake was disgusting. - Who the fuck is this ? Hello ? Hello ? Hello. Agnes. Hello. Hello ? Thanks for the cake. It was completely horrific. Well, er, thank you. Um, how are you ? Hello ? Are you still there ? - Hello ? - I just... Sorry, Agnes. It's not a good line. - That's okay. I just want to talk. - I'm not one for talking. I live by deeds, not words. When I want something, I take it. I don't want to play games. Testify. I am who I am and that's who I am. It's like I always say... Er, what do you always say ? They teach you all the ways to die but only you can learn how to live. I think you're right. Let's cut the crap. I should kiss you. Take me to the moon. Then you can kiss me. Take me to the moon ? - God, she's a dirty little enigma. - She wants you to... Take her to the moon ? How the hell are we gonna do that ? I don't think she meant it literally. She wants you to prove that you're artistic. But I'm not artistic, thank God. You are now. Hi. Er... sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me. Could the band come down to the cricket pavilion, please ? Piss off, Noodle. You heard what the man said. Now. - Amberman. - Headman, sir. Amberman is a scholarship boy. Fairly 'other ranks'. But we took this diamond in the rough... and we polished and we buffed him and now here he is... running an errand for the Adjutant. The very picture of a Caldermount gentleman. - Yes, sir. - Yes, Ambrose. Who knows, in the closing of some glorious day you may yet wear a garment all of blood, which, washed away, shall scour your shame with it and say 'presume not I am the thing I was'. You a fan of Shakespeare, sir ? I practically bathe in him. Three, two, one... Go stars. Action moon dust. And... action. Cut. Cut. I'm alright. Three, two, one... - What's the line again ? - Cut. It's Saint-Exupery. And it's 'Love is not...' ...looking at each other, it's looking in the same direction. Yes, come on. We're gonna run out of battery. Cut, cut. So, the results are pretty mixed. Unless you like slapstick. I'm gonna need to re-sync your dialogue. - I was doing my best, man. - You're just very wooden. Don't take this the wrong way, but you're not exactly Al Pacino. You're not even Jean-Claude Van Damme. Alright. Kind of denting the old self-confidence. - Look, it's fine. - It's not. It's just a film. Look, Agnes is creative and thoughtful and intelligent. This is about proving to her that you deserve her. That you're not just a Labrador in trousers. Look, man, I... I don't need this. I'm okay looking. And I can play guitar. Agnes will like me for who I am. Really ? Well, I'm looking forward to seeing how that works out for you. You know what ? You can be a bit of a dick sometimes. - What's the line again ? - Cut. Hey. Have you seen Winchester ? Saw him heading off over the games field with his guitar. Oh, Christ. And we're going to line two. It's Keck. Hi, Keck. Hello ? Line two ? Keck, are you there ? Shit. I wrote this for you. You bowled me over You caught, you caught me out I went for a duck I've been ruled out by the... Umpire of love Oh, pretty baby I want to be on your team I ain't much of nothing but I'm the best batsman you've ever seen Unless you're a fan of professional cricket Sorry, what's cricket ? What's cricket ? Oh my God. Cricket is a game involving two teams of 11 men... Just a minute. ...all of whom need to be nominated in writing before the toss. It's not going very well. Forgive me, Agnes. - Um, forgive me, Agnes. - Henry ? An ironic representation... An ironic representation... - The young suitor... - The young suitor... - As Troubador... - As Troubador... An aperitif. A pair of teeth. To the main... event. To the main event. That's my lad. That's my Spitfire. Huh ? Go up. What do I do ? - Sorry, I thought you knew what to do ? - No, I've never... The lads think... Just quickly... do I lead with the tongue ? No. I think I'd let her break the ice, tongue-wise. Right. Right. Thanks, by the way. - I'm a likeable guy. - In a weird way. You, boy. - Amberson. - Yes, sir ? How are you, sir ? - What are you doing out here ? - Science project, sir. - Recording the sounds of night birds. - Night birds ? Indigenous night birds. The owl. The nighthawk. The night egret. The night crow. Very elusive, the night crow. A call like you wouldn't believe. - You little degenerate. - Huggins ? How can I work like this ? - This boy's spying on your daughter. - Oh, no. No, I was... Hey ! - You were filming her ? - It's not... Spitfire ! Oh, my reputation. I have lost the immortal part of myself, and what remains is bestial. The Moor. My guest at dinner was the South African Minister of Justice. Doctor van der Plooij also owns a diamond mine. He has four sons. Four. But will he send them to a hotbed of violence, lechery and deceit ? Decent, hardworking families like the van der Plooijs pay your wages. They make up the shortfall from your scholarship, Peeping Tom. They pay because they believe in Caldermount. That name, that reputation, which you dragged through the mud tonight. As long as this remains between the three of us I won't require your resignation. Shut up, please. You'll need new accommodation, somewhere your daughter can't fire the boys' fetid imaginations. - I'm... - Silence ! I will expel any pupil with whom she is caught 'in consortium flagrante'. So, tell me, who was in that room ? - Hello, Mr Amberson. - Good evening, Headman. These are hard times, are they not, Mr Amberson ? Well, the scholarship helps, sir. And we're all very grateful. Now, your son is refusing to name the boy in Miss Babinot's room. Listen. Maybe you think you're protecting someone, but who did you see ? - Whom, Mr Amberson. - Whom did you see ? I don't know. Double bucket run. Technical suspension. Fifty hours in the kennels. You have one last chance, Amberson. Viriliter Age. Thank you, Headman. Come on. Get up. Come on. On the floor. On the floor ! - Put the sack on his head. - I thought you had the sack ? You didn't snitch, Amberson. We respect that. Breakfast ? - She wants to see me. - Well, that is great, isn't it ? I need to see you Thursday midnight by the well I do not wanna get expelled, man. It is meant to be dangerous. Isn't it ? - What ? - Well... love. Yeah. Look, it's Streamers. I need to focus one hundred per cent on the boast, dude. I understand. Can you tell her ? I'm sorry. I'm just not good at all this word shit. Bulldogs ! Bulldogs ! Wait. I will need a sample of your handwriting if I'm gonna do it right. Sure. Make sure she knows she's really great. Bulldogs ! Laura. AGNES Agnes I am sorry to say that I can't see you. Agnes I am sorry to say that it's over. I can't stop thinking about you. HENRY ESCAPE PLAN ESCAPE KIT So please, can I come with you ? How do, neighbour ? Bloody nice houses, these. Good walls. I purchased you a house warmer. - It's a metal fish. - Jelly mould. Um, listen, I'm having a soiree Friday night. Some of the lads are coming down for Founders Day. Noggin and a natter. Bit of bare-knuckle banter. There will be cheese. No, thanks. On Founders Day we're going to make history, boys, because we are effing warriors. Yeah ! - It's 'bodies on the line' time, lads. - Bodies on the line ! Look at the man on your left. That man is your brother. I want you to lay your life down for him. Yeah ! Yeah ! Stop ! - Where is Henry ? - He couldn't make it. The Headman suspects that it was him in your room so he's on total lockdown. So he sent you ? Winch said that if you trusted me, then that was good enough for him. Why, um... why were you hiding ? To surprise him. It's stupid. You come with me ? - Me ? Where ? - Who cares ? - I can't. - Yes. I'm on my last chance. I want to ask you so many questions about Henry. Well, I would love to tell you all about him. Let me show you what Planet Earth looks like. Sorry. Henry's a good writer. He's got this voice. It's authentic, poetic. Yeah. Winch is a very poetic guy. - Will Henry come with me ? - To Berlin ? - Yeah. He's not happy here. - Oh, no, he's incredibly happy. - How ? At this horrific school ? - It's not horrific. This place is bad for the soul. What ? Oh well, it's just... You know... souls ? Don't do that. Don't pretend to be a piggy English fool. Sorry. Where are we going, by the way ? What... In French what do you call those ? Sideburns. - Sideburns. - Yes. Yes. What about you ? Your family ? Me ? My family ? - Brothers ? Sisters ? - No. And you ? You're okay ? Yeah, I mean sometimes I can, I can feel a bit... Blue ? - You know, when I feel... - Blue. I look at people and I try to imagine their first kiss. I mean, do you live in a novel ? It's a positive feeling. His first kiss was so tender. His was against the law. Maybe a cousin. It's that kind of place. What about him ? Alright there ? Okay. - It's 1939. And Victor... - That's Victor ? Victor is leaving to join the RAF. Just as the train is leaving the station, his childhood friend, Wendy, leans up to the window and kisses him. Bam. She gives him hope and that hope keeps him alive. 1945, Wendy and Victor get married. 1946, they realise they have literally nothing in common apart from that kiss and the illusion has chained them together for life. Er, meant to be positive. Eventually, Wendy leaves Victor for some chap that she met in Eccles. Wendy's happy. Victor's not. He's alone. Er, stop. Don't go on. That's what he thinks. But he survived D-Day, dammit. He's not gonna let that stop him. So, he buys a leather jacket and a motorbike and he starts chasing geriatric tailfeather. See, Victor, he's a charming old bastard and he's made himself a promise, every day is gonna be the best day of his life. What about your first kiss ? The theatre gave me a job. - What did your dad say ? - He doesn't know. I'm going to say 'yes'. - What about Winch ? - He can come with me. But what if he can't ? And at first you think they're not gonna get along but... I'm Agnes. Don't bother. She doesn't speak a word of French. And I'm not going to call you tomorrow, because you are boring. He says, I should ask, "What do you want me to call you ? Mummy ?" You've been hurt, but that's not an excuse to hurt other people. Who cared about other people ? Where do you think you're going ? There's a girl over there. Over there. Get Amberson. Now. - You could get me expelled. - I had to see you. Okay. You're beautiful. But, no offence, beautiful people are usually fucking idiots. You should be a nice empty box, you know ? But... you have these ideas in you, these feelings, this voice. I mean, I didn't even hate your poetry. So, you could be ugly. - You could be really fat, like... - Le Michelin Man. Yeah, okay. Or you could have no arms or legs and just be like a little worm. But I will still love you. So meet me at the Norfolk tonight. At ten. And let's go to Berlin. - You there, boy ! - Hey, you there, stop ! Stop ! Get in line ! Everybody in line, now ! She's gone effing postal. - Who ? - Agnes. She thinks I've been writing her effing poetry. Crazy. Do you think maybe you didn't explain it to her properly ? You know, Founders Day, game face, bish bash bosh ? Maybe I didn't dot all of the 'I's or bash all the boshes. Okay. I know some people think I'm a bit of a plank, but you're not telling me something. I did write to her. But then I kept on writing to her. Pretending to be me ? It's not the end of the world. She wants to run away with you. No, you dick, she wants to run way with you. She's fallen for whatever weird Mills and Boon crap you put in those letters. - Do you really think so ? - Yes. She's gonna be gutted when she finds out that you've been lying to her. I wasn't lying to her, I was being creative. Call it what you want, mate. You don't lie to your friends. Well I don't know that, do I ? I'm Noodle, I don't have any friends. You're right. You don't. Quiet ! Unthread the rude eye of rebellion, gentlemen, lest I cry havoc and loose the dogs of war. Break ! Run, move it ! Line up. Just line up. Starlight Express. You will not believe your eyes. It's as if a train's actually in the room. - Adrian. - Goodnight. - Tower. - Goodnight. - Two-stroke. - Night, Huggins. - Skids. - Goodnight. - Bronty. - You're a legend, Huggins. You're a balls to the wall legend. Mmm, that is a nutty bouquet. Understood, sir. No, we'll keep a lookout. Good luck. We've got a break-out. Huggins saw the Babinot girl waiting for someone down at the Norfolk. It's not me. I'm stuck in here, listening to his tale of woe. I told you, Noodle's up to something. I was prepping the oranges... Cheers, Vickers. See you. Maybe she's waiting for him ? Maybe to shag ? - Johnson, you're not making sense. - Come on, Winchester. A term ago, you didn't give two shits about Noodle. What's in it for you ? His name is Amberson. Now shoot. - Pint of bitter, please. - ID ? Pint of lemonade, please. - Are you sure it's her ? - Absolutely. What in God's name have you done to your hair ? Nothing. - Tried to make it look like yours. - Thanks. It's alright. What are you doing here ? Oh well, that's it, then. Balls. You are not gonna let this opportunity slip through your hands. Get in... Tell her the truth and get the hell out of there. I'll draw their fire. It's bodies on the line time. - But, wait... - No, it's alright. Defect to Berlin. I'll have to be Streamers without you. Why are you helping me ? They teach you all the ways you can die but only you can learn how to live. That doesn't mean anything. I made it up. Poetry. Shit ! My bloody car ! Yeah. Yep. - Whom are you meeting ? - Hey ! Hey ! You don't touch my daughter like that. - I just came for a drink, alright ? - See ? Case closed. She's meeting a boy, Babinot. They're running away together. No, she's not. Open your eyes, man. She's got a suitcase. Okay. This is bullshit. He's angry because he tried to hit on me. - This is not true. She's a bloody liar. - You what ?! - What's your problem ? - Pick up your case, we're going home. No, I'm done. Finish your book or don't, I don't care. I'm done. - I can't help you any more. - Agnes ? And you, Winchester. Yeah. They can't do this. I'll tell them everything. This is all my fault. Honestly, don't bother. Pa took it pretty well, all things considered. - Where will you go ? - Well... I'll either white-water raft the mighty Limpopo feasting on big game with... - Or... ? - The Army. Why did you do it ? Because you're a mate. - But are you gonna be alright ? - The Mighty Winch ? I don't know. Compadre. Tell her the truth. I have to tell you something. Before it's too late. You're on the team, Amberson. Do it for Caldermount. Hello, Dad. How was Geneva ? Left, left, left, left right left. This is Thomas Huggins, broadcasting from my alma mater, Caldermount College, on Founders Day. Here we are. What a beautiful day. Old and young. Past and present. Champions versus legends. Age Viriliter. Now, after many years, having graduated to Deputy Headmaster, I have mounted the summit of my own personal journey. Here is the beginning of theirs. Yes, today they face off against the Old Boys, an epic clash which it is my privilege to steward. Get a move on, Amberson. Smile. Come on, then, let's do this. Founders Scratch versus the Old Boys XI. This is it. The contest in which boys become men and men become boys. Have you ever seen Huggins with a bird Great banter. Great British banter. Theirs is not to reason why Theirs is but to do and die Commence the jackhammer. Come on ! You stupid... Run ! Boast ! Come on ! Come on ! Score it, you fool ! Agnes ! Agnes. Hey. Winchester Amberson. It was you ? - Why are you telling me this ? - Because I really, really want to. Because I wanna tell you that you amaze me. And I know that you're going, but I just want to be here, now, face to face, even if it means getting slapped. I never slapped anyone before. The boys in Nantes ? I made them up. I was pretending to be okay, cool, like I wasn't afraid. - Of what ? - Life. Final call for all passengers. Shut your eyes. Come on ! - Score it, you fool ! - Boast ! Dad, I have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. Your words. Why did I do it ? I don't want to be engraved on anything. A board, a medal, a cup. I'm leaving Caldermount. Dad, this is not a goodbye. So I suppose it's au revoir or auf wiedersehen or arrivederci, adios, sayonara, shalom. Your son. Martin. THE END
