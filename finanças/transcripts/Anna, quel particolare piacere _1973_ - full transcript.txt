Wait. Where is the car? - Down there. - Give me the keys, I'll drive. They shot you in the shoulder. Come on. It's nothing, come on... Get in. Don't move. Relax... Keep calm... If you want me to remove it, try not to move. Here it is... Wait... A nice shot. A 9mm calibre. Be careful not to stain my carpet. At least you did a good job. Yes, it's me. Nothing serious. The doctor's sewing him up. The car? It's in the garage. - I'll make it disappear. - You've got to disappear too. Nobody saw me, the car's not in my name. And where do I fit in? You knew Zuco wouldn't have liked this game. And I don't like how it finished either. I'm a peaceful man, When things are quiet business runs smoothly, but if you start shooting up the streets, you're finished. You'd better disappear for a while, paid holiday. No, don't argue. I'm the one who decides. A bit of fresh air will do you good, you'll see. Idiots You can only kill women doing their shopping. A richochet, that son of a bitch... He's gone over to the competition with our business. I should have killed him myself. Because people like you can't be trusted. You're fools. He was just lucky, next time he won't get away. - Consider him dead. - What? I'll kill you... Oil. Look at this. It's about the mafia in Sicily. For me Milan's become a district of Palermo. No,just a minute. Accountant, what did you have? Don't worry, Mr Farina. It's my turn today. If you insist. Do you always ask money for kisses? From cheeky types like you, always. - Have you got a phone? Give me ten tokens. - Can you give me change? For the jukebox, can you give me change? Nice car, isn't it? - Do you have 100 lire? - What did you say? I need 100 lire for cigarettes, will you lend it to me? Here. - very kind. No, just a minute, don't leave. I'll pay you back straight away. - Your 100 lire. - Does it always work? No, but I always try. Can I offer you a lift? I live near here. Fine, I can have a little walk as well. How exciting. Everything's closed, dark. ls it always like this? I don't envy you at all. What happens in Bergamo after nine in the evening? I don't know about the others, but I go to bed. Alone? It was just a question, I don't know the provincial customs. - How do you ask about it here? - I'm home. You're beautiful... but it's not just that. There something about you that interests me. A kind of contrast, your head's full of dreams. And you're afraid of life, perhaps you just need some affection. My name's Giulio, and you? - It's 10 o'clock. - And you're still not in bed. But now I'm going. I'm really home, I live there. I'll be here for you at nine tonight. Just to tell you that I can't come out. - I may be leaving tomorrow. - Where are you going? The way you spoke I thought you'd say Australia. In the Milan there are savages like in Australia. Well, it was nice meeting you. - What do you do for job? I do things that allow me to have this car. I'm expecting a call at 9:30, so keep me company for half an hour. I don't have just half an hour, I've all the time you want. - So you're not leaving? - Not tomorrow. - Did you get something at the bar? Good, lets go down to the night-club. Don't tell me you ended up doing a provincial tour. No more or less than you. Let me introduce my friends. - Want something to drink? - So, what should I say? Tell the Albino he can trust me. I don't know how he'll react. He might think he'll be exposed here. I do business here, you pass it on. - Who are they, people with money? - The usual rich sort. There's the brunette you dumped whose killing me with her look. Anna, I want to introduce you to Miss... Get in. Nobody's forcing you to stay. But if you stay you'll stop this foolishness. The trouble is I like you too much. I don't understand anything anymore, you arrive and... decide whatever you want, it's all so easy for you. I know nothing about you and what's worse is I don't care. Leave me... leave me while there's still time. As you've realised, I'm not really a good man. If you go now, right now, I'll let you go. About time. Enjoying the good life? Loredana called. - From where? - From Rome. She's coming in a few days time to see her mother. She's set for life. I've really lost my head this time. I don't know what's happening to me. When he looks at me I don't understand anything anymore. He can do whatever he likes with me, who knows how it'll end. Badly, if he keeps on hitting you and you do nothing about it. Sorry, I didn't want to... - Why don't you come to Rome with me? - If you'd asked me a year ago... Come on, listen to me. What's keeping you here? I've got a house in Rome that's so big I get lost in it. - At least keep me company. - Don't you have any friends? - Lots, all friends of my husband. You should hear them when they talk about particle dynamics. - Boring. - You're not happy with... With Piero? Everything is marvellous with him. If just that... - I want a child. - And he doesn't? We're not talking about me, but about you. - Have you seen him again? - No,I haven't. At least I hope not. Thanks for the tea and cakes, but leave us alone now. Hear that? Hear how she speaks to her mother since she met him? Loredanda's leaving tonight and we've got a lot to talk about. - So, have you seen him again? - Gone away? - I don't know, he disappeared. Eight days ago... The idea that I won't see him again drives me to distraction. Do you know what time is it? You think I care? What? Your mother's asking that some hot water be left for the dishes. You can't even get washed in this house. - What's she up to, going out tonight as well? - Of course, it's Saturday. Every day's been Saturday around here for a while now. - Why are you here? - I've been waiting for you. Can't you see I'm busy? You do business at a gambling table. Do you trust me? I love you I'm going to Milan in an hour. You can come with me if you want. - Been here long? - No, just got here. I need one more hole... two shots and I'm yours. I'm dead tired, I can't Wait to have a shower. You can have one at the club if you like. I'd rather go home and I've got someone with me as well. In the car. - Oh, really? Who? - A girl. - No, she's not in the business. - So, a total break. Not all of them, I meet a certain kind of people in Bergamo. - Fancy a game for 300? - Million? No, small change. Sometimes I get the idea you think you're still talking to Zuco. Don't fool yourself, I won't be your servant like he was. You work for me too, just like him. And what happened to Zuco? - Shot. - Yes, it went wrong for you. The oven was ready but the chicken escaped. I don't want anybody dead, as long as they don't bore me. Zuco escaped to Switzerland, so he won't bore me anymore for now. That's why you got me to come back. Right, now it's his turn to run. If there's a fire it's a pity. But if someone starts shooting, they'd better hit the bull's-eye. Talking of which, how's this girl? No, don't wake her. All this stuff, these clothes. You shouldn't have, you've spent too much. Now go home. I'll come tonight. Don't be late, though. You know I get bored at home alone. So don't go, take it. Money is there to spend. Buy all Milan if you like. See you tonight. How's it going? A Perfect job. It's better than a safe here, isn't it? This is the documentation, the corpse is at the Monumentale Cemetery. It's a Swiss citizen, Monsieur Pilot. Here's the permit to enter Switzerland. Don't get the wrong corpse. Treat us like two old clients and give us a table on the dance floor. I'm not here on business tonight. - Nice to meet you. - Won't you stay with us? I've got to talk to you, come into the office for a moment. Don't worry, I'll just steal him for 5 minutes and I Won't leave you alone. This is Lisa. She'll keep you company, nobody ever gets bored with her. Now, if you'll excuse us... - What sign are you? - Sign? I'm a Virgo, a virgin, but just for horoscopes. - You're Guido's girl? - You know him? What a question, we're from the same stable. Don't mind what I say, I always have a drink... Have one of these too, it's the ideal start to an evening. To be honest I'd hoped to start it another way. - Something wrong? - We'll soon find out. - How are things? - Good. He's playing a silent game. - I'm in the office if you need me. - Which table do you recommend? - This evening, here. - Your advice brings luck. - I'm pleased. That's enough, leave him alone. Interpol heard about the hearse, Customs are waiting for it at the border. If Zuco paid you to trick us, it's gone wrong for you. Zuco's a cheap Mafioso. But you're even cheaper. And you know how much your skin's worth now? Nothing. If one of your lot sings to the police, it means you're paying them too little. I'd have earned 10% on this deal. Have you tried calculating 10% of 300 million? Nobody would be an informer with that percentage. - Why don't you prove it? - How? We heard someone had sung. The goods are safe. But they've got to reach their destination. You take them. I'd be more noticeable to Customs than the hearse. Send someone you trust, that girl for example. - Yes...she doesn't look like an idiot. - That's the problem. But you send the hearse up there too so they'll stop it and Anna will pass through with the gear. It's the only safe way. I must say a few kicks do you good, they brighten up your ideas. You should try this treatment one of these days. No, it's not for sale. At least, not yet. - Are you going? - Tell Guido I've had enough. If I were you, I'd wait for him. But you're not me, at least not yet. - What are you doing? - You can see for yourself. - I'm getting ready to go to bed. - And what does the case mean? Coming back home gave me a great desire to leave again. - Why didn't you? - I don't even know myself. I'm tired, I'm going to bed. I advise you to relax, be natural. Hey, you look as natural as someone about to be hanged. Come on, don't make that face. With your legs what do you expect those idiots to look at. Fine, I'll take the bus. See you in Switzerland. - Documents. - It's all here. - It's a group? - Anything to declare? No, nothing. What are they looking for in that hearse? The corpse, miss. - I'll drive. - What are you trying to do? Shut up. You forgot this. Tell him who you are. - This is the Albino. - Tell him you're dead. Did the bastard understand? What's going on? You always get cheated, Zuco. Hurry up, get in the car. - You killed him? - He was asking for it. You have the bad habit of overkill, but you've convinced me anyway. It was Zuco's trap and you're not involved. Double-crossing me is dangerous. Killing's also dangerous, especially if you leave witnesses. A pair of eyes saw you kill. They must be closed somehow. She's my property. Yes, but if she talks you go to jail, not her. We'll all go. That's why I want her involved, clear? There's an address, he's a client I hold clear. You said she was yours, didn't you? She'll be happy to help you out. And if she doesn't, worse for her. Because it'll mean you got it wrong. she's not yours, she's a witness. Get rid of your provincial mentality. - Times have changed. - Know what you're asking me to do? Of course, but it's a sacrifice that may bring advantages to us both. You are mad... If you refuse you'll see what they'll do to me. You want to frighten me? I'm just trying to explain we have no other choice. Our feelings don't matter. You've have feelings? Who hasn't got feelings? But money's another matter. That man has a cheque he has to return to me. You're disgusting. That's to remind you to be careful what you say. He's called Frossi, room 32. What makes you think he'll return that cheque? Depends on you, he saw you at the night-club. Relax, I won't eat you. - Want something? Come on, dear. Strip. Slowly though... No rush, this is always the best part. - Your cheque, take it. - You're wrong, it's not mine. Exactly, and he's the boss. Shall we try our luck? - Who's she? - A new one. I'm an expert in haute cuisine, and you? She's not an expert. ...and everything boils over in the end. I can only make good omelettes with women. - What are you doing, are you leaving? - I'll be straight back. Cheer up. Tell me, has this happened before? Yes,two days ago. Have you seen a doctor? This really shouldn't have happened. What do you think you'll do? I don't know. Where are you going? Wait. I'm tired, I'm going to my room. Can't I even do that? - Where's the money? - What money? The bread, the dough, the cash... The money you steal every day. What have you got in your head, sawdust? You still think you're at the cash desk in that cheap bar in your home town raking-off on cappuccinos? In our organisation the accounts must be right to the penny. Listen, do you prefer returning the money or meeting with Riccardo personally? I don't understand. That's to brighten up your ideas. That money's mine, it's my money. Don't say that, you know... - Don't say that again. - I need it. I'm expecting a child. You're expecting what? Whose would it be? Mine...just mine. - You must have an abortion. - No, I don't want to. Whether you want to or not, you'll do what I say. You like it? You don't turn up your nose anymore. You played the precious one, but you're the same as all the others. I hate you. It's all your fault, you brought me down to this level. It wasn't me, I was just the starting point. You couldn't wait, stuck behind that cash desk in Bergamo. That's not true. You're an idiot if you think you can want out. They'll kill you, and your bastard will die anyway. The injections aren't enough, it's in too advanced a state. There's nothing to be done but a small, clean curettage operation. - What are you waiting for? - Where, here? Bring her to my surgery in half an hour. Come on, get dressed. - Now what's up? - I'm not coming. I don't have time to waste. Come on. You'll have to come with us. This is insane, what have I done? There's an Interpol arrest warrant out for you. - What happened? - They took Guido, I don't know why. You've got money? This is all I could scrape together. Thank you, where do you intend going? To Rome, to a friend of mine. Hello, sir. Something to drink? Make yourself comfortable. - You know, I thought you were out of town. - That's what everybody thinks. Tell me, how are things? One thing's for sure, Zuco's got a hand in it. - He's lost his head. - Like Guido. Now the Albinds corpse is a cannonball that could drown you. The Albino's record might push the investigation in the right direction. There's more: the Albino talked to the police at Customs that day and gave them Guido's name. You know what they're like... they love riddles. But there are riddles and riddles. Do they have a chance of figuring it out? If Zuco helps him, I'm afraid so. No, he's not been stupid so far. Not so far, but if they arrest him and lean on him, who knows? Zuco's not the man he was, he's finished. Now tell me, how's Guido taking it? He's nervous, but all in all he's handling it well. And he'll handle it to the hilt, he's a good man. - You can rest easy. - There's something worrying him. He wants to know what's wrong with his girl, Anna. Who knows? She's vanished... and I can't get too involved now. So far you haven't been named. But continue to be cautious. She could either get him off or get him put away for thirty years. She was with him when he blew the Albino away. Now I understand why Guido wanted news of her. No, too dangerous. It's better to lose her than find her. As long as she's out and causes no trouble, let's forget her. He's just fallen asleep. - You shouldn't have. Doesn't it seem like this mother has already begun to spoil her son? You're right, madam. It's time he went back to the nursery. - So soon? - You've got to rest too. - You have something to tell me, yes? - It's not good news. Start with the bad news, I'm used to it. I'm leaving for New York. My husband worked as a researcher in a major industry. And that's bad news, in your opinion? Yes, I'm leaving you here, with no friends... And with a babe in arms, you mean? Thanks to your help the worst may be over. - I'll manage to get by. - Are you interested in books? - To read? - No, to sell. Take it. My husband's friend has a bookshop and needs a cashier. You'll have to do the accounts too, but you'll be paid separately for that. - It's a good job, you'll see. - So, I'll get myself some culture too. The other news? It's him, isn't it? Six years is a lot, but I wish they'd given him a life sentence. Please, leave me alone. I've got one proposition for you, but only one. - Come on, lets hear it. - Vanish from the scene. You got me to come all this way just to tell me that? Take it or leave it. If you accept I'll send you to South America, I've got influential friends there. - What happens if I don't accept? - Not my business. Count the number of friends you have left and give me an answer. This is worse than an insult, and I won't forgive you. - They hit a tree. - Don't move. - I could kill you. - Come on, shoot. Or get lost. Farewell, you ugly bastard. Son of a bitch. Nothing doing, not here either. Lets try the Policlinico. Quicker. You go, there's another two outside. - Doctor, where can we take him? - To emergency, quick. Sister, there's a sick boy. Impossible, there's been an accident, they're all operating. - We can't do anything here. - He's stopped breathing. Sister, please help me. My son's dying. - There isn't a bed... - What now? Doctor, I beg you. My baby's not breathing. - Do something. - Make available room two for me. - But doctor? - That one has a fracture. I've have to do a tracheotomy. - What did he say? - Wait here. - Has he got to operate? - Immediately. - Is it really necessary? - There's not a moment to lose. Don't worry, it'll all be fine. He's a doctor, he knows what he's doing. At least, lets hope so. Sit down. You really shouldn't, but you can stay here till tomorrow morning. He's still under anaesthetic, but it went well. He's out of danger, you can take him home in a week. But for you my son would have died. If it hadn't been me, it'd have been someone else. That's the way life is. Poor thing, she's tired and doesn't want to play. - Are you my father? I don't know my father. Are you sure it's not you? Did you see the present the doctor gave me? I quickly went to Paolo's, but you'd left. Now he's better they won't allow me to stay. I've got to go at the end of visiting hours as well. Rules aside, it's best that they send you away. You've been in there for a week... If things go on like this Paolo will get better but you'll get sick. Apart from that, I was looking for you because it's Saturday. And I wanted to ask... do you like the sea? Take my scarf, for your hair. Are you scared? - No, the opposite. I love it. But how can I put the scarf on if you don't slow down? Hey, I told you to slow down, not stop completely. You're joking, who'll take us back to land? - Why? - We're empty. There's not a drop of petrol in here. - What are you looking at? What are you going to do? You're a great doctor, but not much of a sailor. - I'll swim to land. - Are you mad? Don't tell me you can't swim. Wait for me. We're on dry land, but how will we get back to Rome now? I'm sorry, I really wanted to give you a nice day. Apart from the adventure and the cold water, it was enjoyable. Where are we going? See those dunes? The house of a painterfriend is behind them. He has a phone and will help with the motorboat. I knew he'd be here. Now the motorboats safe, why you don't sleep here? There's a lot a traffic towards Rome now. Why bother? Leave tomorrow morning, agreed? Standing on ceremony? There's a double sofa and you'll both fit. I've got nothing against it, but there's Anna, too. She must decide. When do you start work? At nine, but after four years there they won't fire me if I'm a day late. So it's decided, you'll sleep here. So, let's drink this bottle. Hi, Lorenzo. Mummy bought me a ball. You know I'm going home today? Why don't you come as well? Darling, we must go. Anna, what's wrong? - Nothing. - What do you mean, 'nothing'? I've searched for you for six days, why didn't you answer the phone? Please, don't complicate matters. We spent a nice Sunday together, and that's all. That's all for you, but for me it's different. Doctor, the professor wants you in the corridor. - He can go to the devil. - Should I tell him that? Go, I'm coming. I must go now. Anna, don't you understand I'm in love with you? That's precisely the problem. Please, don't make it all even harder. - Come on, lets go. There's someone else. His father, it's him you love. Why don't you have the courage to say it? See? You're already suffering and you're trying to hurt me. What kind of love is that? He's the dad I like. Why isn't he coming home? He can't, he's a doctor. He has to stay here. You know that all the other children have a daddy? Why don't you buy me one as well? You don't buy daddies at the supermarket. - Get into bed. - Where's Lorenzo's little monkey? Of course, that sly boots must be hiding. I'll go and find him. You know he was already asleep? Be a good boy and go to sleep too. Be good, eh. Be careful not to wake him. I've got your scarf here. I forgot to return it to you. I thought I'd send it to you at the Policlinico in the morning... You'll be sorry. You know nothing about me. Don't say anything. I want you to know... - You need to know something. - I just know I love you. I'll note it down. - Is this the latest edition? - Let me see... - Yes, it's the latest. - How do I look? - Like a freed wild animal. Thanks for the compliment. Luckily my amnesty came, if not I'd have gone soft. You didn't expect me so soon? Looks like you're not happy. - You guessed. - You haven't changed. You left a lot of regrets behind in Milan. Get on with it, what do you want? Don't start again, I don't like questions. Your bastard's in there? A nice place... expensive too. Take it, go to the monks and tell them to keep him full-board. - Come on, move it. - Why should I? - You're returning to Milan with me. - I'd rather kill myself. - You'd leave an orphan. - You're worse than an animal. But I'm not alone any more. - I've got a man. - Right, that doctor... He knows nothing of you or night-clubs or orgies at clients' houses. Would you like me to tell him? Like me to tell him everything? - Leave him out of it. - You're beginning to get it. Hurry up, Riccard's expecting us tonight. Another thing, be careful what you do. Calls to the police, or anything like that, would be unforgivable. It would fall on your son's head. Get out. He'll need a set of clothes. He's over there. I'll go and call him. Paolo, see who's here? You're happy with the nuns? I'm only happy with you and with Lorenzo. Listen... listen my love. Mummy can't take you home today but you'll be a good boy, won't you? Promise me? Mother has to go away, she has to leave. But you'll be good till I return. I'll be back soon, I promise. - Come on, go and play. Go and play with your friends. - I'd like to ask you another favour. Could you post this letter, it's very important. - I'll do it, don't worry. Why are you crying? You should be happy. You're back to being a lady. Look, the wardrobe has been renewed. Riccardo took care of all it all. He did it for me to show his gratitude. Riccardo respects me a lot. You deserve each other. Who do you think you are? Just because you let him seduce you while I was rotting in jail you think you're better than before? Anyway you're here now, whether you like it or not. - If you cause trouble, I'll hit you. - You can kill me, if you like. Come on, stop it. I don't want problems. Look at me, all those years in jail without a woman. Don't touch me. Do what you like with me, but don't touch me. And there I was thinking of you all that time. I hate you, I hate this house and all it represents for me. And I'll hate you till my dying breath. Alright, hate me. Hate me as much as you want. But I know what you're like. I know how to treat you. My dear, when you read this letter I'll already be far away. And I'll have left you're life forever. I should have done this earlier, but your desire to live and love infected me. You managed to make me believe I could also be happy, but unfortunately it's not true. Feel alright? Would you like me to continue? Despite the joy you gave me I wish nothing had ever happened between us. I know I'm hurting you, and I ask your forgiveness. Don't search for me, it'd be useless. It would be bad for both of us. Forget me. Curse me if you like. Hate sometimes helps us to survive, and that's what's happening to me now. That's a good new start. He has a load of money. - Now what'll you do? - You'll pay for this. - Relax, what are you trying to do? - Have I to let her go like this? Outside. Do whatever you want, but no scenes here. I'm not here. What do the police want with me? Sorry doctor, but you have to come with us. What's going on? Don't worry, they just have to give you some information. The woman has expressed the desire that you take the boy to her. I can go today... What's happened, is she sick? Milan spoke about a firearms injury. No other details. Please follow me, we can trust the boy to the nurse. If you come with me, I'll show you something nice. - What? - White mice. Go on, Paolo, It's just for a bit, then I'll be back. Make yourself comfortable. I'm Ferretti, the director. This is Mr Gerli of the flying squad. The doctor's involved in inquests and has to ask some questions. First I'd like to ask one. How is she? It's hard to say, but we've tried a second operation... now she's unconscious and it's impossible to be sure. Just some information. How did you meet Anna Lovisi? I'm a doctor and I treated her boy. What work did the young lady do? She was a cashier in a bookshop. Why? It seems to us that she practised quite another profession here in Milan. - What do you mean? - Haven't you even read the papers? Well, you should read them. Feel cold? Don't tire yourself, the cold's just an effect of the anaesthetic. - But it'll pass. - My poor love... Why? I'm happy to have found you again. I wish it were true. Who knows what they said about me. About you? What do the others know about you? Only I knew the real Anna. And what was the real Anna like? Tender and unhappy at first, then tender and passionate. A wonderful creature. Please don't talk like that, you'll make me die even faster. No, why should you die? Don't say such things. I'm here, I'll take care of you. I've spoken with the surgeon and he's filled me in. The operation succeeded and there's no further risk. We'll go back to Rome together. it'll take time, but you'll heal. You lie really badly, my love. But it doesn't matter... thanks all the same. Thanks for everything. I'm tired, but I don't want to sleep. Lorenzo, help me stay awake. Where's my son? He's here, here with me. Behind that door. I'll bring him in now. My love. Promise me, swear to me... you won't abandon him, he's so small... so defenceless... It's not his fault. Hold me... hold me tightly. Lots of kisses for your mummy. Mummy told me that you're my daddy now. The heart's still weak but more regular. Who knows... She asked me to tell you to take the boy outside and amuse him. - Of course, but you must do me a favour. - Certainly. I want to phone you occasionally to see how she is. - Which one do you want to go on? - On that one there. Hold on tight. I'll wait for you here. What? When?
