[TIRE SCREECHING] [ANNOUNCEMENT AT AIRPORT] [METAL DETECTOR BEEPS] [METAL DETECTOR BEEPS] - Welcome, welcome. - Hello, Mr. Shantanu. - Arjun Singh, sir. - Please have a seat, gentlemen. I thought I'd see you tomorrow morning. Then my PA told me about your tight schedule. - Thank you, Ajay. - Thank you, sir. I shall come straight to the point, Mr. Damani. Two days ago we received your draft for 20 million and this contract. We've studied it, and we can work on it. Well, then I guess it's a deal. There's only one small problem. You've given us 5 percent service charge and we were expecting 7 percent. Before we discuss that... ...I'd like to see the security arrangements and facilities of your firm. Sure. But for that, we'll have to go to the third floor. And we can discuss on the way. - Yeah sure. - Please, follow me. Mr. Shantanu, we've 32 diamond mines in South Africa. We send almost 50 percent of the rough diamonds... ...to Jaipur, for cutting and polishing. But they're not very professional. - That's the reason why we want to try out your firm. - [INHALES] - [COUGHING] - Excuse me, we're here. - Sir. - Come. - This week, we'll be sending you 500 carat diamond from South Africa. - [COUGHING] If we get quality as well as on-time delivery... ...we'll increase our quota. - That's great. - So, before taking any decision... ...please look at the bigger picture, Mr. Shantanu. Sure. - Sir. - This is our state-of-the-art... ...cutting and polishing section. The workers' shift ends at 7 o'clock. That's why the room is empty at the moment. - Excuse me, Mr. Singh. - Yes, please. In this unit the polished diamonds are matched. - Sorted and checked. - [PHONE RINGING] - Excuse me for a minute. - Sure. Yes, Mr. Jethmalani. Yes, I've reached Mumbai. No, sorry, I won't be able to come to your office. It's already seven. Yes, I suggest I'll send my secretary. Mr. Arjun Singh to your office. He'll collect the papers. Yes, of course. We'll meet at the minister's party. Okay. - Arjun Singh. - Yes. Go to Mr. Jethmalani's office and collect the papers. - Okay. - And come to the hotel. You won't have any problem going out. - The doors are self activated. - Fine. There's a thick stainles steel paneling of 12 inches on every wall of this floor. This is the most secure place in this building. [DOOR OPENS] It's impossible to get in here. The diamonds are sorted in this windowed section. And as you know, natural light is very necessary. - Hi. Punch in your code. - Okay. [INDISTINCT] The grills outside these windows are made of 3 inches thick stainless steel. Mike brother, where are you? Hello. Just to let you know, I'm in. It's time to win. At 8 o'clock in the night when we shut down 440 volts of current runs through them. Coming in contact with them will be 100 percent fatal. This grill can't be opened by blasting either. I'm impressed. This is a pretty good setup. - Shall we leave? - Please, come. And by the way, the entire building is monitored 24-hours by close-circuit cameras. This place is like a fortress. I'm happy we're in safe hands. [MACHINE BEEPING] It'll be a pleasure doing business with you. Thank you, Mr. Damani. I assure you, there has never been a theft here... ...and there will never be one. You won't have any complaints from us. Hey. Your sandwich. [TIRE SCREECHING] - Mike, all set? - MIKE:Yes. Good. - So, we're ready to play. - MIKE:Yes, we're in position. It's show time. We're on. [PHONE RINGING] Let's go up. Something's wrong. - Prince. - Mike, what's up? Prince, the guards are coming up. What should we do? - Should we abort? - No way. Mike, plan B. It's plan B. - [WARNING ALARM TONE] - Alert! Alert! Alert! [WARNING ALARM TONE] [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS] Put your hands up in the air! Don't move, don't move! I said, don't move! Or we'll fire! It's show time. [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS] Outside Mumbai Headquarters, where a huge robbery... ...has been committed. We've learnt from reliable sources that this theft... This is the biggest heist ever reported. Yes, the biggest heist... Yes, let's watch what happens next. The CBI is reaching in a short while. [INDISTINCT] Excuse me, sir. Sir. - Sir. - Sir, one question please. Sir, this is the job of the local police. - Sir, one question please. - No comments. Sir, the thief was successful in pulling off the heist... ...inspite of such foolproof arrangements. No matter how far DCOI's Yashoda kept it... ...Lord Krishna stole the butter. - Move back. - Why are you glorifying him? He's just a thief and not God. Sir, don't you wonder how did he commit... ...the robbery inspite of such tight security? Security is only for the white-collared. So, sir, what's for the thieves? - Prison. Only prison. - Sir, one more question please. Sir. - This thief was very smart. - Okay. All the recorded evidence we'd in our video cameras... ...he's erased everything. - Completely wiped them out, clean. - Okay. - Did you find anything? - No. Good morning, sir. You're a very positive man. I see you at every crime scene... ...and you wish me, "Good morning, sir." If anyone dies, "Good morning, sir." If there's a bomb blast, even then, "Good morning, sir." Sir, you're my senior. And... it's my duty to wish you good morning. Your duty is to catch the criminal. - Any clues? - No, sir. We only got the staff's fingerprints. And no one else's. - Mark this. - Yes. He's a very cunning thief. Not just one or two, but he has stolen kilos of diamonds. And from this little hole. Sir, I don't understand how this is possible. Wherever he goes anything is possible. Who's that, sir? Prince. "Come to me, darling." "In your arms." "Come to me, darling." "In your arms." "Rock this party tonight." "Fire!" "Oh my Lord." "I've lost my heart." "Rock this party tonight." "Oh my Lord." "I've lost my heart." "I've lost contact with both the worlds." "Oh my Lord." "I've lost my heart." "I don't know when this happened." "Oh my Lord." "I'll inhibit your dreams." "I'll dwell in your eyes." "My image will dwell in your memory." "No one will ever find me." "Oh my Lord." "I've lost my heart." "I've lost contact with both the worlds." "Oh my Lord." "I've lost my heart." "I don't know when this happened." "Come to me, my darling." "Don't torment me like this." "I'll surrender myself in your arms." "Come to me, my darling." "Don't torment me like this." "I'll surrender myself in your arms." "We'll meet during lonely nights." "We'll talk the night away." "Everything seems different." "Since my world has changed." "Oh my Lord." "I've lost my heart." "I've lost contact with both the worlds." "Oh my Lord." "I've lost my heart." "I don't know when this happened." - Who are you? - What are you doing, sir? Sir, what are you doing? Who are you? Your servant, sir. PK. Who... Who am I? [GROANS] Sir. [BREATHING HEAVILY] So you really don't remember anything, sir? Who... What is my name? - Your name... your name is that, sir. - What's that? - Prince. - Your name is Prince, sir. Prince. Prince? - This... this house? - It's your house, sir. Sir, you've another house in the city. You often come here for weekends. Three days ago you phoned me from your house in the city... ...and called me there. I'd just reached the building compound... - ...when your that arrived. - What's that? Your car, sir. Your arm was bleeding. I asked you how you got hurt. But you scolded me, sir. On the way I asked you again... ...whether we should go see a doctor. But you scolded again. Sir, you kept yelling at me all the way till we came here. And... l hadn't lost my memory then? - [DOOR CLOSES] - Yes sir! You remembered everything. You said to me. Get that from the bedroom drawer. First-aid box! - I got it. I even bandaged you. - But you fell unconscious. And when you regained consciousness you started strangling me. And before I could free myself and say something you fainted. I couldn't tell you anything about your condition... ...or the condition of your car. The condition of my car? It's in a bad shape, sir. Look, bullet holes. Here and another one here. Two. Sir, I feel someone followed you and tried to kill you. Sir, between you and me... ...there are only two types of people who fire bullets. First are goons, and second are them. The police. So, no doctor, no police. Right, sir? Sir, you've another house in the city. - Your name is that, sir. - What's that? Prince. Sir, I think someone followed you and tried to kill you. Sir, can I get anything else for you. Fine, sir. - PK. What... what do I do? - You shift things around. I mean, sir, you work at an import-export firm. Sir, I've your card as well. Here. Here's your office, sir. I'm reporting live from the headquarters of Wolf International. - As you can see behind me... - But what is this? Blue shirt. Black jacket. This is police. Why has the police come near your office? Do you know about the police? Police? You said that I've an apartment in the city. - Yes, sir. It's close-by. - Which way? Left from ahead. Let's go, sir. [TIRE SCREECHING] Keep going, sir. Our building is ahead. - Police. - Police? No, sir. Everyone dressed in blue isn't the police. They're in orange jackets. The municipality. They must've come to clear the garbage. - They aren't the police. - Yes. They're much more dangerous than the police. - Sir... sir, can I go home? - Go. Thank you, sir. Wait! If I don't come back home within 24 hours... ...inform the police. Okay, sir. Who are you? Prince. These are your MRI scans. They're all clear. Your nervous system is in perfect order. There are no marks of internal injury in your skull. All your blood tests are absolutely clear. You also remember everything that occurred for the past two days. Names of people, addresses, how to drive a car, how to come here. You can do all the daily chores. Then why did I suddenly suffer this memory loss? The human brain is still a big mystery to medical science. Your case is strange, Mr. Prince. But trust me, I'll try my best. But it will take time. You'll have to be patient. [GUN COCKING] Prince. I heard that you're very fast. Today I saw it for myself. I'm impressed. So am I. I don't like wasting bullets. So, it's better you don't make any smart moves. Who are you? And what do you want? You'll soon know what we want. Now, come on. Good work, Roy. And welcome to I-Grip, Prince. Indian Government Research and Intelligence Portfolio. You might've never heard about this unit of ours. You're talking to Colonel Khanna, Bureau Chief. Let me come straight to the point, Prince. - Where is that coin? - Coin? - Which coin? - The same antique gold coin... ...for which you struck a deal with Sarang for 500 million rupees. Yes, we know. There are many ways of extracting information. So it's better that you tell us quickly. Where is that coin? I don't know about any gold coin. So, you want to act tough? Now get up, come on. Start the brain-mapper. Let's load his memory. Take note of it. This is unbelievable, Colonel. He has only a day's memory. Sir, how can it be possible. Try once more. Okay, try once again. But you know, Colonel, all the other information is missing. - And it seems like he has... - Like, he has used the coin... ...on himself. Himself? But why? There are many people who are after this coin. We came all the way from India for this coin. It's very difficult to hide this coin. It is very easy to forget everything after using it. Sir, we should keep a strict watch on him. Maybe, he might remember something. Gradually, when his life and memory become normal... Normal? He's Prince, Roy. His life was never normal, and it'll never be. Take him. You've lost your memory and the reason is that coin. So let me tell you a few important things. Sarang wanted to give you 500 million for that coin. You need to remember just one thing. You had that coin in your hands... ...and you'll soon have it again. Because, you aren't doing this job alone. There's someone with you. Your partner. Partner? When your partner contacts you, you tell him... ...that coin is worth much more than you thought. Sarang was offering you 500 million. We'll give you 1000 million. Do you understand? That coin is like God for you. And only that can save your life. But you've only four days. No one can save you after four days. Not even God. Take him. [TIRE SCREECHING] Candy Club, 9pm. Maya. Sir, that's Mr. Sarang. Your boss. Have you ever felt that I'm not into import-export. - But something illegal? - Never, sir. Not at all. You're a very nice man. Actually, sir, once I was in need of money. You gave me double of what I needed. Do you know of any girl called Maya? Not any girl, sir, she's your girlfriend. She works with you. In fact, you also said that you're going to marry her. Do you have Maya's number? How can I have her number, sir? It must be saved in your mobile. But it was lost that night. Maya. "It's show time." "It's show time." [RAP LINES] "You dwell in my eyes." "You inhibit my breath." "Get closer baby." "All day and all night." "The restless heart says." "My heart craves for you baby, now." "My heart craves for you baby, now." "My heart craves for you baby, now." [RAP LINES] "Let me come closer to you." "There are burning desires." "It's difficult to spend these restless nights without you." "Let me come closer to you." "There are burning desires." "It's difficult to spend these restless nights without you." "Life and death are meaningless without you." "My heart craves for you baby, now." "My heart craves for you baby, now." "My heart craves for you baby, now." "My heart craves for you baby, now." Excuse me. Is there a Maya? - Maya. - Prince. I missed you so much. I thought... I thought I'd lost you forever. Oh, God. I was... I was so scared. I was so scared. How is your arm now? Are you seeing your Maya for the first time? - Prince, I'm... - I am... I'm sorry. Honestly, I don't recognise you. Maya. You've lost your memory. But not my love. I'll remind you of our story. Those beautiful moments we spent together. But, someone jinxed your love. Sarang. The biggest white-collar criminal of Durban. But you were Sarang's real power. His number one man. Only a few were fated to play with Sarang. But no one could win against him. [GUNSHOTS] We wanted to start a new life. A life that belonged only to us. And weren't moments stolen from Sarang. You knew everything about Sarang. And only death could separate someone... ...from Sarang who knew so much about him. But you were never scared of death. - Maya, I'm going to steal Sarang's coin. - Coin? Yes, Sarang's coin. It was no ordinary coin. It was made in Sri Lanka, 3000 years ago. And it's said that the gold it was created from came from Ravan's chariot. And it's also said that it has magical powers. You made a plan that after stealing the coin you'd come home and pick me up. [PHONE RINGING] - But that night, when I was waiting for you... - [PHONE RINGING] - Hello. - PRINCE: Maya. Prince, where are you? - PRINCE: Maya, I've been shot. - What? Relax, I'll be fine. Listen to me. I've stolen Sarang's coin. - But his men are following me. - [GUNSHOTS ON PHONE] Prince, are you fine? PRINCE: I'm fine, Maya. But you aren't safe there. Get out of there immediately. Go somewhere safe. - PRINCE: I'll contact you later, okay. - But... Maya, I love you. I love you too. Prince. I couldn't do anything else but wait. Forget about Sarang, his coin and the money. You know, Ruby knows a bar owner in Cape Town. I'll get a job there. Please. Please return Sarang his coin. So he can leave us alone. Right. I don't have that coin. You said you've hidden that coin somewhere. Only the coin can save us from Sarang, Prince. I... I've forgotten everything. And until I find that coin you'll have to stay with Ruby. There are many people after me for that coin. I'm not safe. I'll contact you myself after I find the coin, okay? Okay, but... But, where will you look for the coin? Sarang wanted to give you 500 million for that coin. There's someone with you. That coin is like God for you. And only that can save your life. But you've only four days. No one can save you after four days. Not even God. [PHONE RINGING] - Hello, Prince. This is Maya speaking. - Maya? - MAYA: Yes, Maya. - But I told you... MAYA: Look, meet me immediately at the boat club. - Are you fine? - MAYA: Yes. I'm waiting for you at pier number 4. - MAYA: Come as soon as possible. Okay. - Maya! Maya! Pier number 4? Prince. Prince. Thank God you're okay. I was so worried. How is your arm now? I've been trying to contact you for the past two days. But I couldn't get through to your mobile. And you didn't contact me either. Finally I spoke to Sarang and have taken 24 hours time. - Anyway, we'll need that much time. - Who are you? What's wrong with you, Prince? I'm Maya. - Prince! - You aren't Maya. But you know that I've lost my memory. And you're trying to take advantage of it. Why? Who are you? What are you saying, Prince? What's wrong with your memory? I'm Maya. CBI officer Maya Malhotra. You're Maya? Prince. Prince! What's wrong? Prince! [GUN COCKING] Your gun. Your ID. CBI Officer Prince. CBI? And this is your partner. I mean, mine. Officer Maya Malhotra. We're working with the CBI chief, Officer Khan. Now do you believe me? These... these id's could be fake!! Fake? Do you know what this is? The map of Sarang's house. And this is Sarang's case file. It has all his details. We came here to get Sarang arrested. Operation 'Durban Under Cover'. Stage one, winning Sarang's trust... ...and working with him. Stage two, collecting evidence against him... ...and arresting him red-handed. - [DOG BARKS] - But it wasn't so easy to get to Sarang. Because Sarang is South Africa's biggest white-collar criminal. That's why we posed as thieves ourselves. And committed three high-profile robberies. Paris, Jakarta, and the Diamond Corporation of India. And after that Sarang noticed us. He contacted us and gave us a proposal to join him. Then he gave us the job of stealing an antique coin... ...from the Cape Town Museum. Our plan was that. After we steal the coin and deliver it to Sarang. Officer Khan would arrest him red-handed. The Durban police was after us. Because they didn't know that we were undercover. We parted that day and met only today. We still have a lot left to do, Prince. And I can't do it alone. I need you. One more thing. We aren't just partners at CBI. We're life-partners as well. Here's the coffee. Without sugar and milk for sir. And for madam, sugar and milk are separate. Right. You remember everything other than names, isn't it? What's in the name, Maya madam? Thankfully sir met you. Otherwise, I was going on answering his questions. - Mad. - PK! Okay, sir. That foolish servant of mine says that I work for Sarang's company, Wolf International. An unknown girl says that. Sarang is a gangster and I'm his right-hand man. And now you. You say that I'm an undercover agent for CBI. And I was gathering evidence against Sarang... Prince! Sarang isn't an ordinary gangster. He has offices all over the world. He operates from Durban. But he has connections with international cartels. I don't know how many lies that girl has told you. All I know is that your life is in danger. Because Sarang has contacts from the ministry till the media. Sarang can go to any limits to wipe out his enemy. Regardless of what price he has to pay for it. Sarang gets everything he wants. And now his sights are on that coin. And it's very important for us to find it, Prince. You don't know how dangerous Sarang is. [BOMB EXPLODES] - Any news? - No, sir, nothing yet. Contact to Serena. Find out where Prince and his Maya are. That girl who was dancing here yesterday hasn't she come? There are many such girls who come here everyday. Do you know her address? I don't know her address. Your drink. This is my number. And this is yours. Call me if you find her address. [PHONE RINGING] Hello. Your lover was here. - He was asking for your address. - What? He has offered me 25,000. - Send 50 before the club closes down. - Okay. NEWS ON TV: Hello. Welcome to News One. I'm Pragya. Rahul Singh, son of Infrastructure Minister Vinod Singh... ...passed away in a plane accident. We've learnt from reliable sources... - ...that Rahul Singh. - Sir. Was testing his new private jet. - Rahul Singh's close friend and business associate... - [PHONE RINGING] - ...Sarang has expressed his condolences. - Mike. Sorry, sir. - We've still not found out. - Sir, I'll be back. The reason behind this accident. [PHONE RINGING] For God's sake, Priya, you know I'm with Sarang. Shut up, Mike. This is an emergency, okay. We're in trouble. - Prince came back to Candy Club. - Oh, my God. Why... why did he come there? Tomorrow he'll come here looking for me. - MIKE: Priya, I'd told you before... - Send 50,000 today to Tony... ...before the club closes, okay? Forget the coin, Priya. It isn't easy to deceive Sarang or Prince. Mike. You know I'm doing all this for us. You know I love you. [TIRE SCREECHING] What are you thinking about? About the coin. I've found my Prince. So Prince will find his coin as well. I don't want to leave. But I need to contact the department. They suspect you. And I need to ask Sarang for some more time. But don't worry. I know, you'll surely find the coin. Okay. Khan. I didn't know you'd be waiting here to welcome me. It's such a happy occasion. The CBI was involved in the coin robbery. And you didn't tell us that. Sir, I didn't know that I-GRIP was interested in the coin as well. It's clearly written in 1st August's circular... ...that I-GRIP is the highest authority. Higher than CBI too. I'm sorry, sir, but I didn't read that circular. What happened in the coin robbery case? Maya has located Prince. And we're almost ready to nab Sarang. We don't have anything to do with Sarang. We just want the coin, Khan. - At any cost. - Fine, sir. The coin will be yours. But Sarang will be ours. Okay. You'll have to keep me informed about whatever you do. Why just you, we should inform Sarang as well... ...about the plan we've hatched to nab him. Actually, why don't we publish a newspaper? Times of Crime. Khan, don't act smart. Roy, I am smart. PK, try to remember. I need to know exactly. The other night, did we stop anywhere? - Anywhere? - No, sir, I've told you so many times. That night, once we left from that house... ...we stopped only after we got here, that's all. Car. "Who am I?" "Who am I?" "Who am I?" "Who am I looking for?" "Who am I?" "Who am I looking for?" "I'm on lonely roads." "Who am I?" "Who am I?" "No one knows the moment of my solitude." "I keep following my shadow." "No one knows the moment of my solitude." "I keep following my shadow." "Who am I?" "Who am I looking for?" "I'm on lonely roads." "Who am I?" "Who am I?" "Who am I?" [PHONE RINGING] - Hi, baby. - Maya, guess what. I found the coin. - That's amazing, Prince. - Yes, I know it's amazing. Okay, tell me what we need to do next. Sarang is at his farm house at the moment, Santa Cabana. I'll contact him and arrange for the coin's delivery. Sarang will come with his men. And Officer Khan will be ready with his men to nab him. There's a place amidst the mountains... ...where Sarang can't hide. It's called Wild Extreme. Everything is set. Khan is reaching with his team. Where did you find the coin? In the heel of my shoe. [CHUCKLES] Sarang. Prince, my number one man. I heard that you were shot. I was worried. - Where's the coin? - Where's our money? Coin. Sarang! No! Leave me! There's something wrong, isn't it? How can everything end so easily, isn't it? Yes. Now I remember. Where's your CBI team, Prince? They haven't arrived yet to arrest me. - What was the name of that Officer? - Khan. CBI Officer, Ali Khan. - He hasn't arrived. - PK. The police should've arrived on time, sir. After all, how long can we criminals wait? Right, boss. You've run enough, Prince. Who will save you now? Boss, wait. Wait please, this is a fake coin. It's a copy. Give back the gun, Prince. [GUN COCKING] What are you thinking, darling? That how can your Maya kill you? But Serena can. Yes, Serena. Your Serena. Who could've done anything for you. Give me the real coin, Prince. Or I'll kill you, I promise. Where is the real coin? Sarang. Come on, move. Watch out! [GROAN] Get them, I want them alive. I want them alive. [MOTORCYCLE ENGINE REVVING] [TIRE SCREECHING] - [MOTORCYCLE ENGINE REVVING] - Go. Go. Overtake him, catch them. [DOOR CLOSES] [CHUCKLES] Come on, Prince, you can do it. It's show time. [TIRE SCREECHING] Who are you? Maya. Another Maya. Another story. So, what's your story? All I want to say, Prince, is that I love you. More than my life. I won't tell you any story. I'll tell you the truth. Neither are you Sarang's right hand... ...nor are you a CBI officer. You and I are professional thieves. We've been working with Sarang for many years. The same old story. New twist. Interesting. Go on. Few months ago we decided that we'll leave this profession. And settle down. But it was very difficult to do that. Sarang's organization is a one way street. And there's no u-turn. We had only two options. Either we kill Sarang. Or get him arrested. We chose the second option. We contacted CBI Officer Khan. We offered him a deal that we can get Sarang arrested. But in return we want all our past criminal records wiped out. Khan agreed. A few days later Sarang gave us a job... ...of stealing an antique gold coin. We got the opportunity we were waiting for. - [POLICE SIREN] - [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] Copy that. Centre request clearance on West and Aliwell. Package coming through. The plan was that... ...when we deliver the coin to Sarang after stealing it. Then Officer Khan would arrest him red-handed. The plan was foolproof as well as difficult. - [POLICE SIREN] - [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] Unknown elements on the bridge. Eagle team to Alpha team. Unknown elements on the bridge. Copy that. - [POLICE SIREN] - [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] Hold the convoy. Hold the convoy. Alpha team, clear the bridge now. Move out! Move out! Move! Move! Move! Hey you, put your hands up in the air right now. Leader to Eagle One and Two. Take position. Take position. - Eagle One coming into position. - [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] Eagle Two coming into position. I've a clear shot. All units move up. Blue team, stay with the package. I repeat, stay with the package. Put your hands up in the air. It's a hologram. Code red! Code red! - [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] - Eagle One and Two do you see anything? Speed boat approaching, look down, under the bridge. Copy that, take position. - Go! Go! Go! Go! - Move back! [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] Move! Move! Move! Take position! [CAR EXPLODES] The package is down! The package is down! They're getting away. Fire at will. [GUNSHOTS] - Eagle one, do you have a visual? - Negative! Negative! [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] MAYA: We were successful. But we didn't know that the coin... ...and robbery will change our lives forever. Go on. I won't tell you anything else, Prince. CBI Officer Khan will tell you the rest of the story. You should've let me kill him, Sarang. Why did you stop me? Serena, don't make it personal ever again. Until we don't find the real coin he has to stay alive. He has to die. You've loved him for two years. So hate him for a few days. You've just heard him sigh. He still has to bear a lot of pain. Lot of blood has to flow. Okay, Charlie, let's discuss this in private. - Let's discuss this in the common room. - Okay. Hello, Prince. I feel I'll have to introduce myself again. Khan, Ali Khan. Actually, we're very old enemies or shall I say friends. But this isn't the time to rake up the past. Seeing your condition I'm assured... ...that Sarang has used the coin on you. Just one question. What the bloody hell is this coin? I'll tell you. Come. Lights. The biography of this coin starts from here. Date, 24th August, 2001. Place, Gwalior's Defence Research Laboratory. Characters, a team of chosen scientists from the country... ...who were secretly carrying out research on Nanotechnology. And the most proficient amongst them was him, Dr. Ram. After 8 years, Dr. Ram attained success in his mission. The mission belonged to the I-GRIP. I-GRIP had spent millions on it. What was Dr. Ram working on? Dr. Ram was making a path breaking memory chip. Through this chip human memory... ...can be extracted on a computer disk. It can be altered and re-implanted in human brain again. Putting it in simple terms... ...it means that through this chip... ...you can change a man's thinking. The memory of enemies can be altered... ...and compel him to believe that... ...he's our friend and not enemy. The memory of a super intelligent person... ...can be implanted into thousands of other people... ...and they all can be made super-intelligent. A criminal's memory can be altered... ...and he can be turned into a nice man. The possibilities were immense. Medically and also for the country's defense. - How... how can that happen? - It has happened, Prince. With you. Two weeks ago... ...when Dr. Ram was to make a presentation of this chip to I-GRIP... ...at that time his dead body was found. And the chip and its software were missing. According to the team's investigation... ...this was the job of his assistant. He stole the chip and had fled to South Africa. I-GRIP's intelligence found out... ...that he has struck a deal with someone called Sherry. Sherry is a famous antique dealer who operates from Cape Town. And Sarang's biggest rival as well. He deals in defence secrets and arms-smuggling. Sherry knew what this chip was worth. He sent word to his international buyers about this chip. And made an intelligent plan to sell it. Sherry would often sell defence secrets covertly in his priceless antiques... ...through auctions in Durban. - And that's why he... - He hid this chip in an antique coin. Exactly. The plan was that chip was to be sold in Durban's auction. So that the deal is official... ...and the buyers can easily take the chip out of the country. Sherry arranged to send the coin... ...from Cape Town to Durban along with his other antiques... ...under the protection of the local police. Sherry's plan was good... ...but he didn't have one thing which his biggest rival had. You two. The most cunning and professional thieves in the world. When we stole the coin we didn't know what was inside it. The coin was in our hands... ...and Serena was standing before us. Either Sarang grew suspicious of us... ...or he didn't want to take any chance with the coin. That was the reason why we couldn't contact Officer Khan. We didn't know that fate will play a cruel game with us... ...that will change our past, present and our future. You should only play the games you can win. Whatever the game you should know how to win. Let's shake hands. The coin is in my hand, the cash is in yours. At the moment, everything is in my hands. Coin. Prince, my number one man. What deal has Officer Khan offered you to get me arrested? I want to shoot you right now. But when a weapon becomes rusty... ...we don't break the weapon, we clean it. You've done a great job for me, Prince... ...by stealing this chip. You know what this chip is? I can make the entire world bow at my feet with this chip. I can rewrite lives with it. Starting with you. Mike. Today I'll clear the rust in your head. Erase all of Maya's memory from his mind. Don't leave anything, Mike. I want a Prince that lives only for Sarang. Every step he takes is for me! I want Prince my number one man. [GRUNTING] Mike, don't! Don't do this, Sarang, you'll regret it. Relax, Maya. It's my turn to say to you, "It's show time." We... we're ready, sir. Take a look, Maya. Prince has lost all memories of you. Next time when he wakes up... ...you won't be part of his memory or his world. Stop! Nobody moves. Give me the chip, Prince. You're making a big mistake. You're making the mistake, Sarang. Maya was right. You'll regret it. [GUNSHOTS] [GLASS BREAKS] [GROANING] [TRUCK HONKING] Move. [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] Come on, move ahead. Move ahead. Keep moving. Keep moving. Go. [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] No! Prince! Before we separated we'd decided that we'll meet at the beach house. But when I reached there I saw that PK was already there. I understood that Sarang had still not found the coin. They were still looking for that coin. I kept observing you slyly... ...so that you aren't in danger from Sarang. And waited for the right moment to contact you. That means I remembered everything... ...even after we separated. But Mike had erased my memory with the help of that chip. Just like after deleting software from a computer... ...we need to restart the computer to clear all the traces. Similarly... ...you had an image of your memory in your brain at that time. When you slept at night and woke up in the morning... ...all the images were cleared. It's not just the question of that coin any longer. It's also concerns the national security now, Prince. And now you're a part of it as well. Do you think he has met Khan? I know he has met Khan. Then he must've found out everything. If he knew everything he would've come running to me. Because if he doesn't come see me... ...then tomorrow will be Prince's last day. Prince. There's something I didn't tell Officer Khan. That day you sent me a voice mail. Maya. I'm safe. I've hidden the coin. Gandhiji's looking after it. Maya, remember the letters. But what does it mean? I sent this message from some landline. It must be a payphone. - We should track it down. - I've already tracked it down. This phone booth is on Osborne Road. Let's go. Maya, in the message I said, I've handed over the coin to Gandhiji. Nelson Mandela is considered the Mahatma Gandhi of South Africa. Okay. Maybe the coin is inside this. Okay, I suggest that you go out and keep a watch. I'll open this. The coin isn't in these. This is our arms room. And this is where we've planned all our high-tech robberies. Thank God you didn't tell PK about this. Prince. That's no ordinary IC. They're high-power tracking devices. And this is the receiver. - Come on, move. - Jack, check in the kitchen. One guy go inside. [PHONE RINGING] - Yes. - PK:Boss, you were right. Maya and Prince were coming here. - We followed them as well, but... - But you lost them. - Right, boss. - If you don't find them by morning... ...then you'll be missing as well. Come on, guys, let's go find them. Come on, move it. There's a small thing hidden in this big city. And everyone's after it. You'll find it. Okay. What does this coin look like? How does it look? Just like the fake one. - Which you gave Sarang. - Right. But, why did I hide that fake coin in my shoes? Not you, I did. I kept that fake coin there. You? Serena had weaved her web of deceit all around you! You believed that she was Maya. You would've have never believed me... ...if I'd contacted you at that moment. That's why I hid that fake coin in your shoe. But it was late. Too late. I promise you, Maya. I'll find that coin. For you. Good morning, Prince. Don't be so surprised. I was waiting for you to get up. How do you say this? Life is too short. You must know everything about the brain-mapper now. Everything. But there's one defect that still remains. And the effect of that defect is that your memory is erased... ...each time you wake up from your sleep. And the symptoms of this memory erasure are... ...nausea, temporary blindness and headache. And if your memory isn't reloaded in your brain... ...then your brain will keep crashing like this. It can lead to brain hemorrhage. Sudden death. In this condition you could live for six days. Today is the sixth day. In fact, you've only eight hours left now. Find the coin and take your memory back from me. I'll not kill you, Prince. Just give me the coin. Prince. I don't you want to die. At least, not without your memories. What are you doing, Prince? Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Post Office. Osborne Road. It's on the same road. Mahatma Gandhi Post Office, in Durban? Maya, I think this could be it. We should go check it out. Maya. All the safe-deposit lockers... ...have six digit numbers on them. Every locker has six numbers. I said in my message that Ghandhiji's looking after it. And remember the letters. - Right? - Right. Gandhi. Six letters. Give me your phone. Quick. Gandhi. 426344. We're looking for 426344. 426344. Come, let's go. - Hi. - What can I do for you, Sir? - We'd like a safety deposit box. - That will be 50 Rands. Here. Please fill up the form. Is it possible to get 426343? I'll just check for that, sir. 426343, please. You're in luck, sir, it's vacant. Thank you. - May I? - Sure, sir. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Maya. Security cameras. Cover me.

"With tearful eyes and heavy heart, just for you." Prince. Sweet. The road ends here, Prince. The coin, please. Prince. Prince. Prince. Prince. Sarang did a terrible thing with you. If it had been me, it would've been far worse for you. - Sherry. - Good. Now I don't have to tell Prince... ...that you stole that coin from me. Come on, Prince, be a good boy. And give me my coin back. One coin, and two who want it. Maya. Guys, get ready. [INDISTINCT] Which coin is it? [INDISTINCT] [INDISTINCT] Maya! Maya! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Maya! [INDISTINCT] [MOTORCYCLE ENGINE REVVING] [MOTORCYCLE ENGINE REVVING] Come on, move. Come on, hurry up. Hurry up, come on, move, move. [CAR EXPLODES] [MOTORCYCLE ENGINE REVVING] [GROAN] [GROAN] No! Prince! Darn. - Bloody hell. - What happened? He doesn't have the coin. We didn't find the coin and abducted Prince as well. If he doesn't have the coin... ...then Maya must have it. And Maya will give us the coin to save her Prince. Yes, she'll give the coin. And one day, she and Prince together will kill us. Will you shut up? Sherry was going to pay us 100 million for that coin. - Sherry. Sherry is dead. - So what? Now Sarang will pay us. [TIRE SCREECHING] - Serena, where are they? - They fled. Let's go. [PHONE RINGING] - Mike. - [PHONE RINGING] Hello, Mike. No, Priya. I know you have the coin. But before you go to Sarang you'll have to come to me. Sarang has the brain-mapper. - What do you have? - Me? I have Prince. [PHONE RINGING] Maya, where are you? Officer Khan, I've found their location. Maya, we need the coin. You'll get it. But first I need to save Prince. - The location is... - Just a second. - Okay. - Yes, tell me. Ushaka Sea World. Sea Point. Two of them. Okay, Maya, we'll be there in a while. You just hold fort, okay. Found them. Let's go. The coin. And your gun. First tell me how you can save Prince's life? I've a copy of the brain-mapper software. Which I took from Sarang's laptop. It's the question of Prince's life. How can I trust you? You have to, Maya. You have to. Sarang wanted to kill Prince as soon as he got the coin. I made this copy to save Prince's life. Please, Maya, believe me. Prince has very little time. Gun. Let me see, darling. The coin that's responsible for all this, how does it look? Priya. Prince has very little time. Please, Baby, I just... I just want to see it. Thank you. What are you doing, Priya? Give me back the coin, Priya... You're so stupid, Mike. What did you think... ...a girl like me can fall in love with an idiot like you? [GUNSHOTS] No, Maya. There's just one idiot in this room. And that's not me. I will shoot if I have to. Bye, loser. Priya was right. You're a loser, Mike. Don't worry, Maya, Prince will be absolutely fine. I'm not a loser, I have the real coin. I'd learnt about Priya's greed long time back. So, which coin was that? The same duplicate coin that you gave Prince... ...and Prince gave to Sarang. If I can steal the entire brain-mapper software from Sarang's laptop, can't I steal a coin? Okay. This is it. Here goes. You're incomplete without your memory, Prince. And I'm incomplete without you. Come back, Prince. Or else, or else, we'll lose this battle. Come back, Prince. "Come to me, darling." Please. "Don't torment me like this." Come on. "In your arms." "Come to me, my darling." "Don't torment me like this." "I'll surrender myself in your arms." "Come to me, my darling." "Don't torment me like this." "I'll surrender myself in your arms." Mike. Save me. [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS] No! Maya, no. Maya. No! [GROAN] You had one chance to live. But, maybe, you're in a hurry to die. Serena. Sarang, we know you're here. But there's no escape for you this time. Do you hear me? No escape Sarang. Put your hands up. And come out, one by one. [GUNSHOTS] Go, go. Wait. Prince. Prince, I... I... I'm sorry. [GUNSHOTS] Sarang, Prince. [GUNSHOTS] Let him go. We have the coin. Go. They've reduced firing. Looks like they're running out of bullets. No, Sarang is fleeing. From behind. Don't worry, Prince. We'll soon find out Sarang's location. Colonel Khanna has gone after him. Colonel Khanna didn't go after him. He went with him. [GUNSHOTS] What the... Blanks. There were no bullets in any of I-GRIP's guns. That means we were wrong. We were wrong the whole time. Sarang had already bribed Khanna. He had all the details. He knew bloody everything. And now we've lost him. - Trust us, Officer Khan, we'll find him. - How? We just won't be able to find him now. We will. Wherever Sarang has gone, he must have worn his shoes. I'm sorry, but sometimes good news comes to those who wait for it. - Do you have the coin? - Yes. And very soon you shall have it. - Sarang. - Yes. Where are we going? Is it safe? - I'm safe. Don't know about you. - What? Just kidding. Look outside, Khanna. This is Sharakiya. The point between the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan... ...which is no-man's land But belongs to everyone. There's a base-camp located seven kilometres from here. Here you can find every weapon from every country. But no weapon of any country can locate us here. Tell Khanna that Prince can locate you anywhere. How did you find out about my location? - Ask your shoe, Sarang. - Shoe? [TIRE SCREECHING] [GUNSHOTS] Rogue. Sarang, coin. - Captain, down, down. - Okay.
