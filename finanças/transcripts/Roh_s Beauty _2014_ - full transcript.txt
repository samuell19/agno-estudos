Let go! Don't! Come on, woman! What's wrong with you? -Keep it down. The kids are sleeping. -Have you lost your mind, Safiyah? You're telling me to shut up in my own house! Don't move! You're gonna get screwed tonight! Watch out, kid! -I missed you. I'll give it to you hard! -Hurry, I don't have time for all this. No! Don't rush me! Come here! What in God's name is this? What's this? Who are you? Oh, my God! There's a noise outside! Could my husband, Salah, be back already? What the fuck? Didn't you say he has a shift tonight? Why are you whispering, boy? You must've done something wrong, you devil! Are you trying to bullshit me? Pay what we agreed on! Why are you so flustered, Sayed? -That's enough. Goodbye! -Where do you think you're going? Where are you going? I'm talking to you. Answer me! What's going on, Zakaria? We cannot sleep with all your shouting! What do we have here? Now I understand. You little motherfucker! What's the problem, Madam Shosho? You are speaking so loudly that we can't sleep! Me, shouting? God help and forgive you! Anyways, relax and sleep well, Madam Shadia. Because sleeping is just like singing. Every melody needs a little push. I want you to push, and I want to push you. -What do you mean, Zakaria? -I mean, you're itching to sleep. So, relieve that itch and sleep. But make sure not to snore! Come on, Sayed. Take me home. -Idiot! -Come on, boy! Will you ever stop peeping at women? Can't you quit this disgusting habit? Did you never peep on women when you were younger? You little bastard! Tell me, Uncle Zakaria. I always come here, and you've never told me who this tasty belly dancer is. That is Madam Sabah Alaga. She used to be a renowned belly dancer. Now, she owns a cabaret and a family restaurant. Let's go there and enjoy ourselves. Or is she just for you? Just for me? You little devil! But it's okay, you imp. I'll take you there sometime. Sayed, do you notice the beauty mark under her lower lip, to the left? Yeah, I see it. She has another on her back towards the middle of her spine, in addition to five others in other forbidden places. You're making fun of me. How could you know? Could you even see back then? I know because I always prayed for her, "May God grant you greater beauty!" -You son of a bitch! -"Son of a bitch"? How dare you insult me? I meant it in a friendly way, man. Oh! If it's friendly, I'll let it pass. You know, Madam Roh, our neighbor, reminds me of Madam Sabah when she was young. Stop right there, Uncle Zakaria. There is no one like Roh. How can you say that, you mama's boy? Did you ever see Sabah in those days? -Why doesn't her husband ever come around? -Whose husband? -Roh's, man. -God damn you, kid! What I know is that her husband, Tawfik, went traveling two months after their wedding and, to this day, has never come back. -Drink! -This needs to melt on the tongue, idiot! How could anybody marry such a beauty and leave her like that? He's an idiot, for sure. You're right, boy. But men are like that. A man will search for a woman of unparalleled beauty, but when it's time to shoot, he shoots blanks! You're a naughty boy indeed! Won't you teach me how to beat this thing? Beat? Play! The term is "play"! But it's not your fault. Your father didn't teach you or send you to school. He never taught you anything but cruelty, anger, and beatings. Here we go again with my father and mother and what they did or didn't teach me. Just show me. Are you gonna teach me or just insult me? Why don't you just hit me? To hell with all of you. Give that to me! -Here. -I'll teach you. -Heat some water, Roh! -I'm on it. -Is the water okay, girl? -It's nice and warm. Yes, it is good. Don't pinch me, girl. Why are you so distracted? -Leave it! -Okay. Give me that! Go on, take these away. Lock the door and go to sleep. We need to wake up early tomorrow to finish the transfer. Come on! Good night! Come on, boy, wake up! Get up! -Oh, my God! -Where have you been all night, boy? -I just-- -You just what? You left me alone! Didn't I tell you never to leave? -Didn't I? -You did. Be a man, son! Always stay by my side. Come on! What a beauty! You shouldn't be walking on your feet! Cover yourself! I told you to wear an abaya, but you didn't listen! Hasn't Roh showed up yet, Fawzi? She went out with her mother-in-law this morning and isn't back yet. Why are you looking over your shoulder? Just walk straight! -That girl needs a man to tame her. -No man could tame a girl like that. -Hey, sweetie! -Shut the hell up! What are you staring at? Here she is! -She's pure honey. -Hot! So sweet! What's this, you bitch? Are you crazy? Now you can flirt all you want! What is it, boy? Help me down the stairs. -How are you, Fathi? -Good morning, Um Tawfik. What's with you, boy? Behave yourself! I don't understand why the men are all over her like that. She looks grumpy. -Congratulations, man! -But I want a better deal next time. We'll do our best. Off you go. May God be with you. Good morning. That's a lot of money! What a blessed morning! Is there nothing here for me? Good morning, Arafa. What? More shisha stones, boy. -Why are you so gloomy? -Listen, Arafa. Make the delivery, and I'll make it worth your while. If not, I'll ruin you. I get it. The woman is outside. That's why you're watching the road. Look, Arafa, since you're so useless, just let me handle it. I'll repeat what I said. If she ever went out alone, I'd bring her to you. Why such fuss? Women are all the same, but you're fixated on her. -So, you won't be able to do it, right? -That hurts. I'm the perfect man for this job. You make me want to leave and open a cigarette stall. What are you talking about? Who leaves a decent job like yours to open a cigarette stall, Arafa? Sit down and relax. Take it easy, man. "Give me more love. Give me more!" Let me carry it for you, Madam Roh. How are you, Madam Um Tawfik? -Do you need something? -I just wanted to ask about Tawfik. Does he call or send letters? I mean, is he well? What is it that you want, Arafa? Stop it, girl! I only want the best for you! We're your neighbors and we're at your service. Enough with this "neighbors" bullshit! Do you hear me? Everybody knows about you. Your stench precedes you. Shut up, girl! Why? Don't you think I bathe? Anyone with a nose knows what you smell like! What's wrong, Um Tawfik? I'm Arafa. If I get hit, I hit back twice as hard. You can't say that to me. What's wrong with you? Are you going to rant like a woman? You've built yourself up with dirty money, you pimp! -Look at this, guys! -I should cut your tongue off, woman! Salah, come look! Um Tawfik is wiping the floor with Arafa! What could I want from you, woman? You have one foot in the grave already! Arafa! Behave yourself, man. You can't talk to Um Tawfik like that. -Okay, for you, I won't. Otherwise, I'd-- -Enough! Get lost before I take off my slippers and hit you with them! -You seem like-- -Enough, Arafa! I said, enough! -Get lost! God damn you! -It's my bad, Um Tawfik. It's my bad, Madam Roh. Come on! You've made quite a scene. Go to hell, all of you! What an old witch! -Are you happy about what just happened? -What have I done? Everything that happened is because of you, dear! If you walked straight, they wouldn't think you were so easy! Have mercy! I've never even seen the street! When I do go out, it's with you. You won't even let me look out the window! -Have mercy! -Bullshit! -Do you really not see what you're doing? -I'm doing nothing! I keep to myself! It's the same speech every time we go out. You will act decently until your husband returns home safely. My husband! Where is that husband of mine? Sayed, prepare some shisha for the boss. -Good evening, sir! -Give it to me, son. So, what do you think of this blend? It's good, Arafa. You're doing better already. Oh, I'm relieved! I like an oily weed. The smoke goes directly to the brain. Better than yesterday's horrible weed. Shame on you, boss. I'm the king of good vibes. A lousy blend isn't worth the coal that's burnt to smoke it. Sayed, renew the shisha stone for him, boy. Quickly! -Why are the women so late, Arafa? -What's your problem? Relax! Here they are. Go, let them in! They're late. The women I deal with always have perfect timing. Welcome to an evening full of beauty and joy! Good evening to you! Here they are! Come here, darling! -Walk me-- -Say hello... Come here, girl! I've missed you, beautiful! Now you know my word is good, boss. I'm head of the Great Rack division! You're a liar, and you aren't doing enough to maintain your livelihood, Arafa. What do you mean, Talaat? If you're so smart, why do you keep disappointing me? It will happen. She will come crawling to you on her knees. How the work is done is more important than actually doing it. Isn't that right, people? -Of course. -Enough with that already! Honestly, Arafa, you're only able to get second-hand women. Are we second-hand, boss? Who are you calling second-hand, boss? Yes, second-hand. Stained couches. That reminds me, cutie, your wedding night with Anwar is tomorrow. Why do we have to get married, boss? Listen, girl. This marriage will protect you from the police and their raids every now and then. Understand? Congratulations, dear! Amarah is a tough girl. Do you remember those two days? -How could I forget? -Congratulations, Anwar! I feel for you, Arafa. Roh's mother-in-law made a fool out of you! Do you think I'd let a witch like that humiliate me? I'll make her pay three-fold! Tell me, Mr. Talaat. Who is this woman who is keeping you up at night? An exceptional woman! One you'd pull out all the stops to get! -And who is this woman? -Roh. Those countless hours... made up for all the dancing and happiness that I had missed in those long years. Didn't I tell you it's a small world? Work hard, men. I want decorations that everybody will talk about. May God make us all happy! We'll see. How the work is done is more important than actually doing it. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. All this joy and entertainment is thanks to our boss. Trading in spare parts is his field. He is the original, the excellent, Mr. Talaat, the Jaguar! Love has brought us all together. The whole world will hear us, and this will be a wild night! Let's hear it! This is a greeting from my heart to my dear, precious one. If we fall in love, it's because we have good taste. Let's hear it! -What are you doing there, girl? -Watching the wedding. Wedding? Shut that stupid window. Come on! -Get in your room and go to bed. -Okay. Why are you still standing there? Get in! -Okay. -God damn you, idiot! -What are you doing there, girl? -Watching the wedding. Close the window and go to sleep, sweetie. I've had it up to here with you. I'm just having fun. Isn't it enough that I have to endure this horrible life with you and keep your son's reputation clean? -Women like you-- -Like me? I'm not just any woman! I keep both men and women on their toes! And if I ever decide I want a man, they will line up for me beneath the burning sun! -For what? -I'm the original product. Take a look! I don't have crooked teeth or deformed bones, and I don't need to straighten my hair. Listen to me, Roh. The small neighborhood we live in is a sea containing fish of all shapes and sizes, but the stench of each one is the same. I'm fed up with the stench of your words, and of being imprisoned here with you! -Let me go. -You want to be freed, Roh? No, I want my husband to keep me company and have a good time with me. I want him to eat with me every day and make me feel safe every night! -Where are you going, girl? -I'm going out! -Be sensible and stay inside, girl. -Why don't you just die? If you're looking for beauty True beauty is within the soul There are people with exceptional beauty Living lives of pretense What good does beauty do If you're living in pain? Don't let beauty deceive you Don't let beauty deceive or delude you If you let it deceive you You'll sleep each night on a burning bed Beauty, no matter how fascinating Will eventually fade away Beauty, no matter how fascinating Will eventually fade away Love of the flesh will not last What will last is the beauty of the soul Oh, my long nights Oh, my sleepless eyes What really hurt me What broke me inside Was that I gave them my all And they abandoned me They abandoned me They abandoned me They abandoned me Tomorrow will reveal Who is really caring and who is cruel Only then will you know the true me When time reveals everything When time reveals everything When time reveals everything I'm swimming in rough water With big waves all around me Throwing me around And everyone is taking advantage of me Everyone is taking advantage of me Everyone is taking advantage of me I lived my life for them And I feared for them They made me forget who I am And I'm not staying with them anymore I will be the last one standing I will be the last one standing I will be the last one standing Some people throw God's gifts away And others pick them up and honor them Whoever demeans women Whoever demeans women Will be demeaned in life Life has humiliated many powerful men Put your hands up Oh, dear Oh, dear Oh, dear No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! If you don't put your hands up... If you don't...! Oh, Abdel Salam! Sing with me! Isn't this it? The beauty The beauty The beauty This isn't it Oh, yes, it is The beauty The beauty Sing with me, sing with me, sing with me Sing it You prince! Again! Repeat that again! Oh, dear Oh, dear Oh, dear Congratulations to the groom! Congratulations to the bride! That's enough! What? Are you gonna kiss me, hug me or what? I haven't decided yet. This situation is bigger than me. So, you're one of those men! One of what men? Behave yourself, or I'll teach you a lesson! Do you think you're married to some sissy with a man bun? Bun or no bun, make it quick. Take all the time you need... and show me what you can accomplish. My stomach really hurts. I must've drunk a lot. Tomorrow, I'll rock your world. What? Tomorrow? Move it! You've taken up a lot of my time and effort. I didn't even touch you! Where are you going on our wedding night, woman? -Are you going to stop me? -Just don't be late. What is that voice? Certainly not my stomach. Oh, my God! Sayed, stop! Sayed! I'll make up for your parents' deaths. I'll spoil you and take you with me everywhere. I have to go to Kuwait for two months, then I'll take you away. Won't you say yes? Hot delicious fava beans! -Who is it? -It's us. Open up. -Good morning, hun. -Good morning. We wanna talk to Um Tawfik, please. One minute. I'll go wake her up. Oh, my God! Help! Help me, Mother! -Um Tawfik! Um Tawfik! -Help me! Oh, my God! -Come and take a look at your dear girl! -That's enough! Don't make a scandal! Couldn't you find anyone other than my husband, you whore? -Mother! Help! -Oh, my God! -Help me, Mother! -What's going on? -Oh, my God! -What's happening? Don't you know what's happening, you shameless old woman? Your precious little daughter-in-law was having sex with my husband! -Oh, my God! She's lying. -Oh, my! Are you messing me around, girl? -While I was asleep? -Why are you doing this? -What a scandal, Tawfik! Oh, dear son! -I'll make an example of you! -Let everyone here know... -Help me, Mother! ...that Roh, who's pretending to be an honorable woman, was sleeping with my husband in her apartment! Nobody in the world has any shame anymore. I couldn't bear to be touched by another man! And the old witch, Hanem, is covering for her! -Such a filthy old woman! -This is scandalous! Why? She's disgraced us all, the shameless tramp! Stop it, all of you! I said, don't make a scandal. I'm a man. I can do whatever I want! If there was a man in this place, he'd have killed her already. -You're no man! Did she cast a spell? -What's going on? Madam Roh, put this on. -She must have cast a spell on him. -Are you trying to prove you're a man? -What's this, Sayed? -If you touch her, I'll cut you open! What the hell is going on? What's this, Sayed? You're holding a knife, you son of a bitch? Acting like a thug? Get the hell out of here! What's going on here, Anwar? What happened? Are you still here? Get the hell out, you son of a bitch! -What happened, Madam Roh? -They're falsely accusing me. What's with you, Anwar? You just got married! Are you bored already? No, boss. She's the one who winked at me and told me to visit her at her home. You lying son of a bitch! Get the hell out! And put your clothes on! -Mother, I swear, nothing happened! -I'll cut your throats if you come back! Fine, have it your way, then! But I swear, if she ever approaches my husband, I'll beat the shit out of her! -Get out, woman! -They attacked me and undressed me! -Oh, my poor son! -Move it, man! -Oh, my poor son! -May God protect our women! Your wife has disgraced you! Please, Um Tawfik. Don't tell him anything. He'll be so shocked, it might even kill him. -Oh, dear God! Um Tawfik! -Mother! -Mother! -Um Tawfik! -Mother! Wake up, Mother! -The woman is gone! -No! -Oh, my dear Um Tawfik! My dearest! Mother, please wake up! Hold her, Roh. I'll take care of everything. I'm a brother to you. Oh, sweet Um Tawfik! No! No, Mother, please! No! The commandment of Allah will come to pass... -You raised a knife to my face, Sayed? -And I'd have cut you open with it. -Quickly, How much for this? -This? 35 pounds and a phone case. I will take no less than 400 pounds. Four hundred? Are you selling an apartment? Do you want me to tell people? I saw with my own eyes that you couldn't consummate the marriage. There's nothing going on here, people! Keep it down, man. This is a heinous claim! That was all just practice. I consummated the hell out of her later. Liar! If you don't give me 400 right now, I'll tell everyone. Fine, Sayed. What a fucking way to begin the day! -There you go, Sayed. -Give it here. -Be strong, girl. -Thank you. -Be strong, honey. -May this be the last of your sorrows. Thank you. Sayed. What's wrong with you? -I have something I need to tell you. -What is it? -Talaat and my father aren't saints. -You're hiding something from me. I know that you're nothing like the women they hang out with. That's why I'm warning you about them. You must pay Talaat for the funeral. Take this. -How did you get this? -I make good money. Just take it. -I have enough money. -Come, Mr. Talaat. What an honorable man! Good evening, Sister Roh. God has spoken the truth, indeed! Listen, Madam Roh. We've come here to discuss something important. We want to get to the point as gracefully as possible. What does that mean? Mr. Talaat means to say that we're here for you. All you have to do is ask. We will do anything you ask of us. Anything you want, consider it done. Thank you for taking care of the funeral costs. But if you don't mind, I want to know how much it cost. Don't ask that, Mrs. Roh, please. It disappoints us. There's no need to be so formal. Let your road be paved with grace and friendship. My husband, Tawfik, can take care of my needs. Tawfik, you say? We wish him the best. But isn't it enough that he has left you here all these years, Roh? Anyways... Just so you know, Mr. Talaat is doing all this for you. Just for your sake. -Why go to all this trouble? -He cares... and wants to be cared for. I have to go now. Take care, Madam Roh. Thank you, sir. What's this? -Where's your family? They didn't show up. -I have no family. How come? Since Mother died, I've had no-one but Tawfik. I wonder what he'll do when he finds out that his mother died while he was away. -Did you tell him? -He didn't pick up, so I sent a message. I told him that his mother died, and that now, I'm all alone. -Don't say that. I'm right here. -God keep you safe for me, Sayed. I'm worried about him. What if something bad has happened? Sayed, I need you here first thing in the morning. We'll call him from a different number. Maybe he'll pick up. You got it, Mrs. Roh. Thank you, sweetie. Come here. What are doing here with these kids? You should be thankful that your father sent you to school, unlike mine. -He didn't even send me to preschool. Go! -Okay. Tough guy! Do you shout at Roh like that, too? Roh? She wouldn't argue with me. She cares a lot for my feelings. -Bullshit! Words are worthless! -Yeah, they are, punk! -So, you're sleeping with Roh? -I leave her house at dawn every day. -You gotta be kidding? What do you do? -I kiss her lips and hug her. Bullshit! He's fooling us all. -Stop listening to him, guys. -It's none of your business anyway. Did you really kiss her lips? Her lips? -Yeah, her lips. -Take a photo, and we'll believe you. I don't need a camera. I can show you when Roh and I go out tonight. -Give me a cigarette. -There. Do you have a light? You little devil, Sayed. He is going out with her. You just lost to him. Really? Just because he's walking with her? You're just bitter that you lost. She's walking by his side. I'll show you! Don't come crying to us! -Look, Jaguar. Like father, like son! -A copy of his father. Since he's started so early, he'll end up beating his father and bringing in loads of money. He's still not picking up. Call him for me again, please. The number you have called is not available... What? His phone is off? Where's his father? Call him and tell him to come here. -Who is this girl, Sayed? -Just a neighbor. Don't mind her. What is it, boss? I came as soon as I could. Take care of her, then. -Take a look at your son. -What did he do? You son of a... It was my idea. Do you think he'd act on his own? I'm trying to find a way to get you what you want. More importantly, have you had your morning fix? -Put it in, quietly. -You got it. This is an original piece. So, Mrs. Roh was with you this morning and you didn't tell me, Sayed? I'm angry with you. Just you wait until you find out what happened between us. -What happened? -Remember that woman you told me about? Damn! Why did you have to remind me, Sayed? She was so small and cute. She used to tell me, "I only feel like a woman when I'm in your arms, Uncle Zakaria." -She called you "Uncle"? -Sometimes. Anyway, let's hear about you. Tell me everything, Sayed. What I did with Roh is much more than what you did with that woman. They say that the best test of a swimmer's capabilities is to throw them in water. Prove to me that you can swim, and then I'll believe you. Sure, I'll prove it to you. -Who is it? -It's me, Sayed. -Come in, Sayed. -I have a guest with me. I'm no stranger. Good evening, Mrs. Roh. What a sweet smell! Come in, Uncle Zakaria. Excuse us, ma'am. Come here. How could you do this, Sayed? No stranger has ever set foot in here. He's no stranger. Uncle Zakaria came to offer his condolences. He's blind. -Welcome, Mr. Zakaria. -Thank you. How do you take your tea? -Don't worry about that. -A couple of spoons. -Has she left the room? -Yes. -What did she whisper to you, boy? -She's upset that I brought you. No kidding! That's why we should leave immediately after having tea. -Did she actually say that she’s upset? -Yeah. She won't be able to get comfortable with me while you're here. Tell her that I'm blind and I see with my hands. I already told her, you funny guy. Damn you, you little devil! Here is your tea. What a heavenly smell! Thank you, dear lady. There, Uncle Zakaria. Thank you. May God keep you safe. By the way, tell me, my lady. What songs do you listen to? -Anything. -This isn't the time for this. The woman just died, and you're talking about songs? Right! I'm sorry for your loss. -We have to go. We're late. -We didn't even get to talk! Fine. Madam Roh, next time, I'll play "Oh, Night, Please Don't End" for you. We've stayed for longer than was needed. -Let's go, Uncle Zakaria. -Listen, Sayed, didn't you want me to take you to see Mrs. Sabah Alaga? Yes. So what? I'll take you, then, and we can take Madam Roh with us to have some fun and take a look around the city. -What do you think, ma'am? -Maybe. Let's go, Uncle Zakaria. You're such a pain in the ass! You know, she only let you in because I was with you. You didn't want me there because I figured out your lies and knew that you hadn't done a thing with her, you little liar! Did you think she would have done anything with me while you were there? Isn't it enough that my hands were all over her body? All over her body? Do you think I'm blind, kid? -Get the hell out of my face! -Suit yourself, man. Sayed, wait! Wait up, kid. Take me home, at least! -You can go home by yourself! -Sayed! At least tell me... does this street have lights or not? -Hand me a rolling paper, Sayed. -There you go, Dad. Believe me, you're the only one I hope will turn out better than me, because you're my son. And Mr. Talaat is our man. He's a generous man, and he's the one putting food on our table. Do you see what your friend Osha does? Do you see how he keeps by the boss's side? He's a smart kid! I want you to be even smarter than him. No, I want you to be as smart as I am. I know I didn't go to school, but I have the mind of a genius. These are our three mottos: "Yes, sir." "I got it." "Consider it done." -Do you get it, Sayed? -I get it, Dad. Pass the tape. Let's go for a drive around the hill while we smoke this lovely cigarette. Drive slowly, okay? God be with you, Sayed. -It's been so long, Ziko. -God keep you safe and well, my lady! This right here is Madam Sabah Alaga. She's among the top artists in the Arab world. Thank you, Ziko. Who is this little darling? This is Mrs. Roh. My neighbor. Are you a dancer too? Dancer? She just came with us to get some air. -And who is this little guy? -Sayed. A friend of mine. He's a little devil, but he's also very brave and gallant. It's a pleasure to have you here, sweetie. -Where is her beauty mark? -"Beauty mark"? -I was just saying you're very beautiful. -God damn you, kid! Madam Sabah, I've told them about your great fish dish. The one that could bring a dead man back to life. Ziko, consider this your very own restaurant. You and your dear friends can come here any time. You have no excuse now, Mrs. Roh. You must come with us here all the time. -I wish I could. -Mrs. Roh doesn't leave the house. -Why are you dressed in black? -My mother-in-law passed away recently. Why would anyone wear black for their mother-in-law? Come with me. Come on. Come on! Let's see if this dress fits you. How can I stop wearing black? -Where are you from, Roh? -From Mansoura. Oh, my, we are from the same city! That must be why I liked you instantly. -You're from Mansoura? -I ran away when I was a little girl and came to Cairo. When I was younger, I was just as beautiful as you are now. I knew I was beautiful. Dancing ran in my blood, and I began a career in it. And this where I've ended up. You are doing just fine. May God keep you safe! Listen, put on that dress and follow me to the kitchen. Come on, sweetheart. Zakaria is very hungry. Go and check on Roh and your dancer woman. "Your dancer woman"? Is that what you call her, you son of a pimp? They're having women's talk. Why are you so worried? I'm afraid she'll teach Roh to dance. You have no shame, talking about dancing like that! Listen, Sayed. Is there a platter of desserts anywhere? Yeah. Get me a few pieces. -Are you even hungry? -I am. Get me a selection. Oh, my! You are so beautiful in this dress! You're such a kind woman, Madam Sabah. -Why are you so innocent, girl? -Innocent? What do you mean? Life is always unfair to the innocent, and you have such a tempting beauty. If you stay this way, people will walk all over you. -What do I do? -Be strong. Face life in all its colors. -You're such great company, Mrs. Roh. -Thank you, Mr. Zakaria. Oh, my! Your voice is like a cool breeze on a hot summer's eve! You're gonna blow us away with your talk of breezes. We're already home. We can't be seen with Mrs. Roh. You're right. Mrs. Roh must walk on her own. Go ahead, my lady. -Have a nice evening. -You too. Sayed, let's follow her for her own safety. -Go home, man! -Wait! Sayed! -Look at that. That's her, guys. -Your woman, Mr. Talaat. Arafa, what's going on? Why does she look so different? She's wearing red instead of black, and she's gone out on her own. Yeah. But so what? She can wander off all she wants. You want her on a leash? I told you that I could bring her to you in chains, but you refused. Take it easy, Arafa. A sweet courtship makes for a sweet honeymoon. Your best stones for the boss, kid! -Good morning. -Good morning, hun. -How much did you do last night, Shadia? -Just a sad hundred-pound note. -Fine. I owe you 40. Remind me. -All right. -What about you, sweetie? -What about me? I sent over all the money I made with Mona. Didn't she deliver it? -She did. -Listen, stud. Why don't you stop by like you used to? You slut! Keep your focus on work. Personal concerns ruin professional life. -Suit yourself. -Keep your phones on. -I've got customers tonight. Understand? -Yes. What's our motto? How the work is done... ...is more important than actually doing it. -Take care. -Bye. Bye. Come on, Sayed. -Where is number seven? -Do you have a description? -Who are you here for? -Roh El Masry. -Madam Roh? What do you need her for? -I have to hand her a divorce notice. Divorce notice? Madam Roh isn't here. She's in Mansoura. She stops by every month to pay the rent. Give it to me and I'll deliver it myself. I can't do that. I'll have to see for myself that she isn't here. Come on, man. There you go. She's a sister to me! You got it. -Give me the paper. -Your ID, please. Don't you know who I am? I'm Arafa El Syriaqusi. And here's my ID. -There you go, man. -Thanks. -Your ID. -Thank you. -See you. -See you. I have a thousand-pound piece of information. What is it, Arafa? Did you quit your job or what? Never! Give me my reward first. Say what you have first, and then we'll put a price on it. Finally, he's divorced her. -Who are you talking about? -Tawfik. Roh's husband. He divorced her in absentia from Kuwait. Go and get us two cups of tea, kid. I ran into the person serving the notice and gave him a little something for it. She doesn't know yet, poor thing. Watch it, you piece of shit! -Do you think it'll change her mind? -Of course. -Take this. You've earned it. -What is this? 200 pounds? A little bit more appreciation, man! I'm working on this full time! Paying the guy alone cost me 200 pounds! Come on, Jaguar! That woman is as good as new. She was only married for two months Just get it done and I'll give you a big reward. In that case, we need to strike while the iron is hot. She didn't even get the chance to be a real wife, getting divorced so soon. Excuse me for now. I need to go and tell her the bad news. Come with me now! -Don't be too brutal. -I'll be kind, indeed. Go, Arafa. -Who is it? -Open up, Mrs. Roh. It's Arafa. -What do you need, Mr. Arafa? -Just a few words, sister. About what? It's not appropriate to talk to you from behind a closed door. You know that I don't let strange men come in, Mr. Arafa. What I came to say will make us more than just strangers. -What is it? -I have news about your husband, Tawfik. -What's wrong with Tawfik? -Excuse me, sister Roh. I'm so ashamed. I don't know what to tell you. What is it, sir? Tawfik has turned out to be a despicable bastard. -What happened? -How could he divorce you? You took care of his mother until her final days! Poor thing! Sit down, sister Roh. Take it easy, dear. You've waited honorably for him for years. He's divorced me! Tawfik divorced me! How do you know this? I wouldn't lie to you. Here are the papers. He sent someone else over with the divorce papers. Such an ungrateful son of a bitch! I don't want you to be sad. I'll be by your side, like a brother. I'll take care of you and keep you safe. Consider me your closest friend. We've known each other a long time. My dear, I know that the shock is huge, but it is what it is. You must forget about him as easily as he let you go. Mr. Talaat is here! Come in, Mr. Talaat. You're no stranger. He's wanted to come since he found out. He's a true gentleman. Sit, boss. I'll be back in five with something for you to drink. Excuse me! Don't be sad, Mrs. Roh. Tawfik did not deserve you. He didn't deserve even a single hair from your head. Who, in their right mind, would leave a beauty like you? Listen, Roh. Your neighbor and I can’t bear the thought of you living alone. I'm lonely, just like you, and I understand what you're going through. You have no idea how much you mean to me. I swear, I see nothing good in this world but you. Just trust me and I'll make you a princess. If anyone dares say a word about you, I'll cut out their tongue. Let me be your man, Roh. I know it's bad timing. But I can't keep it in anymore. I'm an honest man. But I'm not an easy woman! You're pointing a slipper at my face! Fine, Roh. Fine. Why? Why? Why, why, why? Why? Leave me be! Open up. It's Sayed. Sayed! Sayed! Sayed! Come here, man. Where have you been? I need to talk to you. -What's up, boss? -What's with the attitude, Mr. Sayed? Is your father giving you superman pills, boy? Osha! Yes? Go and get a cold drink for Sayed. Sayed? Why the hell would I get him anything? Do what I say. Right now! This isn't like you, boss. Sit down, and I'll tell you everything. Listen, I know that you're an honest guy, the best in the whole neighborhood. Right? Listen, man. I don't like how things have turned for Mrs. Roh. And I need you to help me be there for her in this difficult time. Listen to me. Roh is my responsibility. Touch her, and you'll be in big trouble. I hope you get it or I'll have to sort you out. Sort me out, Sayed? You used to pee all over my clothes, boy. Say hi to your honorable father! Have some dignity, and don't let anyone slap you. It's none of your damn business! Why did you anger Mr. Talaat? We have business with him! Why'd you do it? I didn't do anything! He thinks I'm dumb and he wants to use me to get to Roh. Why can't he? Help him, if you can! What is there to lose? Be smart, you bastard! I'm not like you, and I never will be! You wish! What's wrong with me! Am I tainted? I work my ass off to keep this house running and feed you and your mother! Yeah, and you use women to do it! You son of a bitch! Women, men, why the fuck do you care? Why do you care? All you should care about is your mother and brothers, nothing more! Understood? If you're fine with that, you'll be fine with anything. Are you fucking lecturing me? You lecturing me, boy? You will listen to me, or I'll fucking cut your throat! Sayed! You will not stay here another minute, you bastard! -Have mercy on the boy! -Shut up, you retarded woman! You're a bad fucking omen! Get out of my face! -Have mercy on us! -You spoiled him! -God is our protector! -Shut the hell up! Go to sleep, you fat pig! That's my girl! That's the way to deal with them! I don't even know how I had the courage. God made me strong! Stay strong, and you'll be able to handle anything that comes your way. Listen, sweetie. Watch out for yourself, and don't let them push you around. Get out there and teach them. Oh, my! Why is she suddenly in the mood for dressing up and flirting? She's lonely, and she's ripe. She needs a man. The road has finally been paved. What are you waiting for? If she's ripe, go and pick her. -Right away. -Go. It'd be too bad for such a beautiful thing to be left on the shelf! What are you staring at, boy? Go and get me a cup of coffee. I wish I was a piece of clothing, so that you'd wash me with those hands. Nothing is getting the dirt out. I don't know what to do to clean you! What's tainted will always be tainted. Enough with the laundry. I've got something more important to say. I can't get rid of this mud stain. Nothing is working on it. Just use a different approach. I'm the man for the job. I make things extra shiny. Still dirty! I've washed it a thousand times, and it's still dirty. Come on, Roh. Are we gonna keep going back and forth? I'm talking business here. Anyway, I'm having a small gathering. I have all the best detergents, and it's still dirty! I don't know what to do! Such a filthy place! -Who is it? -Arafa. -When are you gonna stop? -What's wrong, Mrs. Roh? I'm a man of honor, and I'm knocking on your door. Hear me out. -What? -Good enough. Throwing water is a sign of hate, but I'm an optimistic and forgiving man. But even though I forgive you, there are still people angry with you. They'll teach you a lesson, hun. -Make it short, Arafa. -All right. I like making it short and clear. -We're having a small gathering-- -Gathering? What gathering? Don't act like an innocent little girl. You wander all over, and we watch in silence. Why not include us in your plans? Let me live in peace, you people! If you don't come willingly, we will force you to come willingly. I'll be waiting for you. Don't make me angry. Open up. It's Sayed. -Open up. -Leave me alone, Sayed. Uncle Zakaria! Uncle Zakaria! What? What's wrong, kid? What's with you, Sayed? -I don't know how to help Roh! -What's wrong with Roh? My father threatened her. He wants her in his choir. Your damn father! He won't leave her in peace. Your father's filthy stench is all over the neighborhood. What are we gonna do? She's sitting at home, crying. I'm afraid that she might hurt herself. She won't open the door. Don't worry, kid. I'll get dressed and we'll go to her house right now. This is your night, boss! Don't jinx it, Arafa. These things are sensitive. I'd never jinx it. I'm the one who brought her to you, with my blessings. He's right. And she's charming! If you have any problems tonight, boss, we're here for you. What a stud! A woman's man! Enough lying, Anwar. Get the hell up. I'm not at all comfortable with how you're talking about this. And now she's late. Take it easy, man. Be cool. The other women aren't here yet. Are we having other women, too? Listen to me, all of you. I'm paying for this night, and the women, too, -so you'll keep your eyes off my woman. -Right. A single blessed bite would suffice for a hundred hungry mouths. My bite is for me only, kid. Keep your hands to yourselves. At least leave us a few crumbs, boss. Share, and don't be greedy. I'm the boss, kid! I always score. Share and score? What do I do, then? You're the technical director, Captain Arafa. Let's go, Sayed. Walk slowly, boy! Open the door, Mrs. Roh. And be easy on yourself. Nobody can force you to do anything you don't wanna do. Madam Roh? Could she have given in and gone there? "Gone there"? Sayed! Sayed! Answer me, kid! She didn't show up, man. Just keep ranting on, with your stupid motto! Come on, boss! I swear on my dear mother's grave that if she doesn't come, I'll humiliate her before the whole neighborhood. All you're good for is taking my money. -I'm spending all my money on you! -How can you say that! Honestly, you're a shadow of a man, good for nothing but talking. -Are you speaking to me, motherfucker? -Listen, man. If you can't control the women anymore, step down while you're still on top. So, this is how it's gonna be tonight? You're making me the joke of the night! What's wrong, Mr. Talaat? This woman is tormenting you. Listen to me, all of you. Know your boundaries, and don't talk shit. I don't want to have to hit anyone. I'm leaving. Where are you going, boss? I don't care if they leave, but I don't want you to! Get off me, Arafa. I can't stand you anymore. Just calm down, and I'll make it happen. Roh! Roh! Roh! Roh! Open up, Lady Roh! Open up, Roh! Roh! Now you've made me angry. All right! Where did you go, Roh? I can't think, Sayed. Do you have a little piece of hashish on you that could help me focus? How are you in the mood for this? I'm going nuts! Where could she have gone? She doesn't know anyone but us. -Maybe she went to Madam Sabah. -You devil! Sayed! Where are you going, kid? Sayed! -Take me with you! -Stay here. This is not a holiday. Sayed! Open the door, boy! Sayed! As long as no-one has anything on you, don't worry, dear! Don't believe That monsters Could ever Become human Causing pain Is what they do And unfairness Is in their nature To them, betrayal Is just another thing they do... -Zakaria! Welcome! -Good evening, Madam Sabah. -Good evening, Zakaria. -Did Roh come to you? I'm right here, Uncle Zakaria. Roh! I've finally found you! You got us so worried, dear. Sit down, sweetie. I've missed you a lot. God bless you, Madam Sabah. -Make yourself comfortable. -Thank God! -Bring that here, boy. -Thank God! Don't be so grumpy, my dear. Nice! Very nice! What do I smell that's so delicious? ...as though they can never Have enough of betrayal Don't believe That monsters Could ever Become human Causing pain Is what they do And unfairness is in their nature To them, betrayal Is just another thing they do To them, betrayal Is just another thing they do They're betraying everyone as though They can never have enough of betrayal They're betraying everyone as though They can never have enough of betrayal... Roh, consider yourself under my protection from now on. I'm sorry, Madam Sabah. Roh is under my protection. He has such a good voice! I've been looking for you everywhere! It's okay, Sayed. Don't worry. You devil, Zakaria. I personally locked you in! How'd you get here? You thought I wouldn't get out, little bastard! How did you get here? Madam Sabah's maid gave me the address. Come on, son. Come, sit here, Sayed, and have some dinner. Eat something, dear. Go ahead. -Excuse me, Madam Sabah. -Yes, dear? I wanna talk to you in private. Come, dear. Anything you want! Come with me. -What is it? -I wanna borrow 300 pounds. Just until I can go back to my hometown and repay you. -Anything you want, my dear! -Thank you, Madam Sabah. -I'll never forget this. -I've got more than enough. -Good evening, Madam Sabah. -Hello, Mr. Ashraf. Now I know why you asked me to come so quickly. We are so pleased to have you here. -It's a pleasure to meet the sweet lady. -Please, make yourself comfortable. -Excuse me. Ladies. -You're welcome. You are such a lucky girl! Let me tell you why. Where did they go, boy? They're standing over there talking about God knows what. Be a smart girl and try to keep up. Wealth is contagious. That man is very rich and privileged. Come with me. Come on, don't think too much! Come with me. -Welcome, Mr. Ashraf. -Thank you, my lady. -It's a pleasure to have you. -Have a seat. -Welcome. Have a seat, dear. -Sit down. Sit down. I'll sit down with you. Please! -Sit down. -Go ahead. Have a seat. The gentleman is a very dear friend. You are very welcome. -What's your name? -Her name is Roh. -I'll be back in a minute. -Sure. Don't worry, dear. I will be right back. The man is a friend. Don't worry. You know, Roh, you have a beautiful name, but there's something about you. Your eyes are charming, but so full of sadness. Do you want a drink? Here you go. It's just juice, nothing to be scared of. Drink it. Tell me if you like it. How are we? -Where are you going? -Let me go! -Sayed. Uncle Zakaria. Come here. -What's wrong? -What is it? -I just wanna go home. I'm tired. -Are you okay, Mrs. Roh? -I'm tired and I wanna go home. Okay, let's go. -See you tomorrow, Madam Sabah! -Let's go, man. Easy, boy! -Let me see that picture again, kid. -Here, I sent it to you via Bluetooth. So? How do you open it, boy? Open it for me. -There you go. -Nice, Osha! You're a smart kid. What is this, man? She's got an open buffet down there! Why did she push me away, then? -Let me handle it this time. -I let you handle lots of things. It was truly a sweet, sweet night The men must have gone blind to desire a tramp like you! Shut up, smelly Salwa! You're a disgusting witch! Acting like an innocent girl when you're a slut! You've turned out to be a whore! Keep walking, don't mind them. -Oh, my! -"Oh, my"? She's turned out to be a slut after all, but only with outsiders! -Immoral brat! -Shut up, pig, with your sissy husband! Don't mind a thing they say. They are faulty at their cores. -Watch out. -A bunch of vicious and spiteful women who hate you and are jealous of you. There she is. Get ready. Your night will start in an hour, boss. This is your last chance. God forbid I'd ever wanna take someone's living! Good job, Osha. You're Jaguar Junior! This is very nice! What happened to the word? How could you dishonor the men of this place? You're the last person who should talk about honor, you pimp! Watch your language, Arafa. I'm warning you! What's your problem, you pitiful, drunken bar musician? Stay out of this, or pay the price! I'm talking to the babe who's running around with strangers and ignoring us! Why? Aren't we manly enough for you? Come here, bitch! -Come here! -Let me go, Arafa! Get your hands off her, Arafa! Stop it right now! Zakaria, I don't wanna hit a blind man! I might be blind in my eyes, but you are blind in your heart and mind! Listen, pimp. Roh has more honor than you and your women combined. -You filthy people! -Go to hell! Don't worry about them. I'm here for you. Open the door, princess. Open it, you little bitch! You don't learn your lesson. Open it! I'll open it. What the hell are you doing here? Didn't I warn you about coming here? -Stop hitting him! -Don't stare at me like that! -Sayed, Leave! -You won't leave? -Still staring at me! Get out! -Leave, Sayed! -I won't! What do you want with her? -Why the fuck do you care? Get the fuck out of here, boy! Hey cutie! What is this beautiful photo? The whole neighborhood has seen it. You got yourself a little scandal. And now you're exposed. -I'm so sorry, Uncle Zakaria. -You didn't do anything, Sayed. I'll stop by later with Mr. Talaat for a good time. -I'll either kill you or kill myself! -Kill me? Why so vicious? If you kill me, my women will finish you. If you kill yourself, the men who want you will finish me. So it's best if we all just have a good time. I'll be back. Take a shower. Is it fair, what Dad is doing to Roh? I fear for her so much! Sayed, I love Roh. What? Are you out of your mind? Roh is mine, and no-one can harm her. Do you understand? Sayed! Sayed! Boy! What the hell? What are you doing, boys? Are you gonna burn the place down? I'm gonna tell Mr. Jaguar, I swear! -Osha! -What do you want? -You're a weak, useless kid! -Weak? I'm a barricade, boy! If you were strong, you'd have stood up to Talaat when he insulted you. What do you want me to do? He's my boss! Fine, turn around and present to him your back to whip. Sayed, I don't wanna hit you. You're okay with what they're doing to Roh? I am. She keeps disobeying the Jaguar. Would you be okay if it were your mother or sister? I'd bury anyone who dared hurt my mother or sister! Think of her as your sister. Are you with us? Osha is not a man! I'm with you. -A man! -A true man, Osha! Fill them up, boys. We'll burn it all down. Manhood isn't just about words, Sayed. Whoever comes close to her house is a dead man! Let's work quickly, guys, before they come. Roh, open the door. Don't be scared. This is Zakaria. Open the door, Roh! Forgive me, Roh. Please, forgive me. I hate my blindness, now, because I couldn't defend you. I couldn't protect you! You must know, Roh, people aren't all cold-hearted. Not all people are like Arafa and Talaat and their gang, or their women. There are good people out there. Their voices are unheard, but I hear them. I know them, and I sense their presence. I told you, I can do it. Take this pill. It'll help you get the job done. No need for pills. My burning desire is enough. -What the hell is this?! -If you touch Roh, we'll burn you up! This is what you raised, Arafa? Sayed! What the hell are you doing? Molotov cocktails, boy? Are you gonna set fire to your own father? A dog would show more appreciation! -Go away, you little dogs! -Come closer and we'll burn you! Bring me that boy! Those kids need a good beating! -Hang him upside down! -Let me go! -Move, Fawzi. -Let me go! Let me go, you bastards! Let's go, Arafa. We have no time for this. -Consider them your kids. -I want them crippled. I may not be able to see you with my eyes, but I see you with my heart. Roh. Roh! Roh... I'm... I'm in love with you. I don't need your love! Oh, God! Please, take me to your mercy! No! Roh, please, don't say that! You might as well wish death on me! I swear to God, I don't want anything from you. I just want you to be happy. Where are you going? Roh! What's happening? What's happening, Roh? You sons of bitches! This is your night, Roh. Where do you want to go? Let me go, you sick bastard! -Stop! -Who's the sick bastard? Who's the sick bastard? Stop it, Roh! Stop, you little bitch! I told you to make it easy for yourself, but you want to get raped! Don't be scared, Roh! I'm right here. I won't let them hurt you! You dogs! I won't let them! Roh! Where are you going, bitch? Let me go! You're making a scandal, you dogs! I won't let you! -I'll kill you, Arafa. You filthy pimp! -I don't wanna hurt you, old man! -I won't let you. -Move! -Let me go! -Go where? -Hitting a blind man, Arafa? -Yes. Someone, help me! Help! You son of a bitch! I love you, Roh! Roh, I love you so much. You're the most precious thing in my life. I'll get you whatever you want. I'll give you everything you need in this life. I'll protect you. Do you see, now? See this blood? You're hurt. You're leaving! Why are you leaving me? Your precious little daughter-in-law... If you walked straight, they wouldn't think you were so easy! Wealth is contagious. Talaat and my father aren't saints. I love you, Roh. If you don't come willingly, we will force you to come willingly. Oh! My legs! Did you have a good time? I can't take it! Roh! The darkness held me back and will always hold me back! Leave, Roh. Leave. Roh! -Get the hell out, you slut! -Roh! Get the fuck away, you disgusting bitch! Roh! Roh! Roh! Roh! This place will finally be clean! Roh! Leave, you disgraceful whore! You little bitch, tainting our honor! Roh! Subtitle translation by Ahmed Khedr
