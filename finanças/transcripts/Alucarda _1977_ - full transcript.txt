It's a little girl, my lady. She's beautiful. My baby. Poor little creature. I'd like to see you grow. But you must survive. Take her to the convent. Please promise you'll protect her. And don't let them take her. Swear. Swear. I swear. I will protect her. I'll take her to the convent. Justine, at last you're here. This way Justine. We were so sorry to hear about your parents' death. We've been expecting you for several days now. Come on. Come on! Here she is, Justine. Yes Mother Superior, I know Danielle has been very happy here with you. - Excuse me mother. - That's alright. They were just leaving. Now young lady, I hope you will not forget us. No of course not. She'll be back again next summer. You've done wonders and soon she'll be able to do things for herself. Won't you darling? I'm sorry I can't stay, but we have to get back to the village. Patients get restless you know. Mother... This is Justine. - Reverend Mother. - Now child. There's nothing to be afraid of. Life must go on. What you need now is rest. - Is the room ready Sister Angelica. - Yes Mother. Remember Justine. From now on, this is your home. - Sister Angelica will show you the way. - Thank you. You will find a new life here Justine. Come along. Now you have to think of yourself. Remember the Lord will always be here to guide you. And so will I. Come right this way Justine. This is your room. Let me open the window to let in some fresh air and sun. And this... is your bed. Now promise me you'll try to get some rest. - We'll call you in time for supper. - Thank you Sister. - Justine. - Yes? I hope you'll be happy here. But if ever you're in need or troubled Please don't hesitate to call on me. Alright? Thank you, Sister. Hello. I'm Alucarda. - My name is Justine. - Who's that? My mother and my father. - Mother just died. - I never met my mother or my father. - I'm sorry. - I've got something to show you too. These are things I never show anyone. They're secret. Every day I find a new secret. Look. Look at all this. It belongs to me. This for instance. It means I like you. And this. Do you know how small creatures love each other? No. I'll show you. I'll take you to the gardens, to the woods. Everything is there. What's that? I've never seen anything like them before. It's one more secret. One is identical to the other. It's like an image in a mirror. Like you and me. Do you want us to be sisters? Come on. Come on. Look. They are burying a sister. She killed herself. They will bury her in unhallowed ground. I'm afraid of funerals. We have to die. All of us has to die. And there's no way we can avoid it. Don't be afraid. It's not very far. Come on. Well, well, well. What have we here? Would you like to see... Oh, please. Please don't be afraid of me. I was just in the middle of an interesting game. Would you like to know what it is? I think we should start back. Would you like to know how someone will die. Or would you like to buy an amulet? Which will bring good luck. Lots, lots. I have many more things myself, in these woods. Follow. Don't be afraid. Follow. Come on. No. Come on. He won't hurt us. Justine! Alucarda! Don't believe such a creature. He'll only tell you lies. Better let me read your hand. - Oh, my God... - What did you see? Nothing. Perhaps a reflection of her own dreams. I see nothing. Only shadows... Take care. She's yours. Sell her your charms for the supernatural. Look at the marvelous things that I have. Among other things I profess the useful art of alchemy. I can turn dust into precious stones. and these, in dreams never imagined. And you, young lady. Look. This knife was the tear of a gypsy girl. What strange eyes this girl has. Deep, sharp, mysterious. As the birds in the forest. I see clearly. Your past and future, your dreams. You've come from the dew in the forest and there they will be waiting for you. Strange creatures they are, and you must take care. If it obsesses the young lady, here I am and here is my box of charms. If she wishes I will make her free from such a dream. then if the dream comes true, I shall be expecting her. Hey, where are you going? Did I offend her? Alucarda! Alucarda, wait. Look. It looks so familiar. - Let's go inside. - No! This place scares me. Let's go back. Are you afraid? Justine This is simply beautiful. Come. I hear the voices from the past. I feel as if I've been here before. I remember every stone and branch. It's as if I lost this world a long time ago. One can live eternally instead of turning into a little pile of dust. Are you... - Are you afraid of dying? - Yes. Everyone is. I mean dying, loving each other. Dying together, to live as one forever. With the same blood always flowing through our veins. Darling. Darling Justine. I live in you. Would you die for me? I love you so. I have never been in love with anyone. And never shall. Unless it's with you. - Do you mean that? - You're quite right to ask. You don't know how dear you are to me. I hope you love me as I love you. Call me cruel and selfish, but love is always selfish. You don't know how jealous I am. I want you to love me to death. Alucarda, for the love of God, Don't talk to me of death. I have a dream. The memory of a night. I was almost murdered. Wounded here. I was never the same again. - Were you near death? - Very close. Let's make a pact. If we ever depart from this life, we shall do it together. We shall do it together, Alright. If it makes you happy. No, Alucarda! Wait. Lucille died in 1850. 15 years ago Justine. Our age. See what's there. I'm afraid Alucarda. - Let's open it. - No. My God! I told you this place frightened me. Look what it's done to you. Please let's go back. It's cold. I'm shivering. We have to Go back. Go back. Go back! The devil enters the body of the person he wants to control. Uses the organs of that body for his own pleasure. And performs feats, far above the capacity, strength and ability of the person thus possessed. Here in the holy book for the knowledge of mankind, since the days of our lord, and even before, Satan and the other demons have persecuted the souls of Christians. they make no distinction between men, women and children. He, the devil, uses the bodies of others as his own, destroying those he wants to dominate. Perverting their language and distorting their lips. Froth exits their mouths rather than words. Lead a virtuous life and place yourselves in the hands of Our Lord. You must live within the rules of our religion. The only true religion. Otherwise the devil will find a place inside our bodies and take our souls away. And then... we shall burn in hell forever. Throughout eternity. Your souls will find no rest. Your bodies will suffer eternal torture. The wrath of Satan has no mercy. Repent! Oh, God, please help me. I don't want to burn in hell. Calm down. Justine, what's wrong. Answer me. Are you feeling better now? What happened? I don't know. She shouldn't be left alone. She should rest for a while. I can look after her. Please don't leave me alone. I can stay with her. Would you like to stay Alucarda? Alright. We'll leave her in your care, Alucarda. If you need anything, I won't be far. Monsters! Monsters! They have done this to you. Justine. Don't tell of our secret. I hear voices. Voices from the past. The same dark voices. They were soft at first. I was looking at the trees and the voices began to speak to me. Coming from the forest. I can hear them clearly Justine. Only you and me. Only you and me Justine. My God, I'm so scared. We will make them pay. Bit by bit. For all they have taken away from us. Alucarda. Lucifer. Lucifer. Satan! Lucifer! Alucarda, for God's sake. What's happening? Please! Alucarda, please stop it. Death! Death! Death! - Death. - Alucarda. Please, no. Alucarda. Answer me. Answer me, please. Answer me. We'll make a pact and seal it with our blood. We'll make them pay. You're right. We'll make them pay. To start with, a little rain. Thunder! Call him. Call him. Call him! Lucifer! Satan! Look at me. You're so beautiful, Justine. Look at me. Look at me. Now you shall blend. One with the other. one with the other. And then... blend into me. Look at me, dear Justine. Welcome Justine. Giver of all gifts. Of flowers and fruits. Jesus. give me strength. Please. Behold the body of thy new servant. My Lord. Don't abandon me. Manifest your spirit. Satan... Lucifer. Do not abandon me Lord. We beseech thee, Satan. God! Save Justine. Don't abandon her Lord. Please keep her from harm. Today we will continue studying the teachings of Saint Theresa. And this is what the devil does. To beget his evil he obtains help from our virtues. Even if the gain is small, his harvest is great. But God in his infinite wisdom understands the wiles of the devil. And so gives us the strength to face them with noble thoughts and prayer. In this way, I trust that you have been listening. Yes Sister. Then you can repeat what I have just read. Well, Alucarda? Stand up child. And this is what the devil does. He grants us virtues to expand his kingdom. The only valid one. God with his lack of knowledge does not understand this truth, and opposes it with false thoughts and prayers. God. Silence! I renounce the other God and all the saints. Don't listen, don't listen to them. Lord and master. Don't listen. Go out of the room. Go, go, go. I promise to do all that is evil. I will declare you name to all and will not cease to serve the Lord of Darkness. My body, my soul and my life belong to you. Call the Mother Superior, quickly. What's wrong with you girls? God help up, please. Please, stop it. Alucarda, my child. This is blasphemy. Listen to me sisters. This is blasphemy. God help me. How dare you blaspheme. Are you mad? Have you taken leave of your senses? Answer me. Answer me. I only repeated what you said. God forgive you. You have just invoked the kingdom of darkness and rejected the infinite wisdom of God. And now you deny it. And Alucarda too. Liars. Repent. Here in front of the cross. Beg. Ask for forgiveness. - Sister Germana - Reverend Mother, thank god you're here I have to inform you of the strange and blasphemous behaviour of these girls Mother, in front of me Sister Mary and all the pupils. Justine and Alucarda denied the Lord our Christ. They used the most evil language to recognise Satan as their Lord and Master - I can't believe it. - But it's true. What have you to say for yourself? Sister Mary. Send for the doctor, perhaps they are ill. Father Lazarus will be here soon. I want them both to be prepared for confession. - Go, hurry now. - Yes. - I need more light. - She gets worse by the minute, doctor. - How long has she been like this? - Since this morning. But she has got much worse. Her pulse is faint. Her heart is weak. This girl is very sick. Pray, Justine. Pray, my child. Pray for the sake of your soul. Pray. Pray Justine. Pray. What is it girl? What's the matter? Easy girl. Easy. It is your turn now Alucarda. - Yes my child. - I... I... - Yes, go on. - I was told to come to you. Speak up then. I was asked to answer a question and I did. And Sister Germana is angry with me. And for a very good reason. I am not what you may think father. The facts were explained to me my child. You have sinned. I don't recall doing anything wrong. Liars rot in hell for eternity. I know for sure that you are doing wrong. Don't miss this opportunity which has been granted you. You can tell the truth here and now. Perhaps I have done wrong. I couldn't have lied. I love life... with With... - Go on. - Justine. is a close friend of mine. I love her. You call yourself blessed, and believe in eternal life and worship God. I worship life, you worship death. I love Justine. You love to kill. We have made a pact and sealed it with our blood. Justine and I The fault isn't ours, but yours. You cover your body with a black cassock as if you are ashamed of it. But you'd like to possess me wouldn't you? Take me. Take off your cassock. - What happened Father? - What happened? Please sister, get her out of here. My God, no... no. All we can do is wait. We'll know better tomorrow. - I hope she'll recover. - I'm convinced she will with the help of the Lord. The things she said were so horrible. Please Lord do not abandon us in such times of difficulty. You did not hear what she said. It was the devil. As if the devil himself was speaking through her mouth. These words cannot come from anyone else, only the devil. - The devil. - The devil. Father Lazarus. Do you really believe that because we belong to the church we are safe from the devil's influence? I remember when I visited the archives at the Vatican. I read many incidents that had been confirmed. Incidents like this. In 1491, at the monastery of Cameron some nuns became immensely strong. They barked like dogs and predicted the future. They contaminated the rest of the community, and made the monastery a temple of the devil. In 1550 the nuns of the convent of Nazareth became possessed. They climbed trees like cats and levitated for hours. In 1555, in Rome itself, in an orphanage just like this one, three orphans were responsible for horrible things, which could only be the work of a diabolical mind. Two of them became seriously ill. And the third finally died, killing all three. Justine and Alucarda may be possessed. Mother The devil is elsewhere, not in those poor girls. It looks like we are the victims of a conspiracy. Justine and Alucarda are possessed by the devil. It's not surprising that Satan has chosen these delicate creatures. His plans are directed against the Holy Church and its representatives. They may not be possessed by the devil himself but at least by one of his evil messengers. What are we going to do? We must pray that God can help us. Jesus Christ Deliver us from this nightmare. Don't let them... possess us. How long has Justine been like this? Almost a week. And then she became ill. She fainted during the hymns and said the light affected her. That's it. A heliophobic demon. A sixth category devil who hates light. He acts at night, when the shadows protect him. We must destroy him in order to free the girls. We must prepare... an exorcism. Justine. Poor Justine. I won't let them harm you. I won't let them take you away. I'll take you somewhere where you can be safe. My poor Justine. You've got to help me. - No. - You must get up. Sister, what d'you think you're doing? Open the door. Come child. Do not despair my child. We are here to deliver you from evil. It's not the child, but the demon inside her that's resisting. I shall prove this by exposing la marca diaboli. The devil's mark she has on her skin. The mark of the devil. Remove her clothing. God of heaven. Jesus Christ. Die soon! Die soon! This is all the evidence I need. You have all seen her. They cannot stand the name of our Saviour. They are possessed. You'll die soon! Silence her. I order thee, evil spirit in the name of the one who judges. the one who has created and can destroy the world, The one who has the power to send you to hell. Go! Depart! Leave the bodies of these two servants of God. They must return to the Holy Church. By the power of my faith and of the Holy Ghost I demand that you return to your bottomless pit. Humble yourself at the feet of Christ, because his faith is greater than yours. Christ before whom you tremble. Christ who takes lost souls from the fires of hell, to the light of heaven. Now depart. Back where you belong, evil spirit. God commands you. Do not resist. God the Father commands you God the Son commands you God the Holy Ghost commands you. The Holy Cross commands you. The faith of St. Peter and St. Paul commands you. All the saints command you. The Holy Cross commands you. All the faithful command you. Depart, seducer. Enemy of virtue. Stop it. Stop it, I say. Stop it. Doctor, how dare you interrupt our holy ritual. Holy ritual. This is the most shameful thing I have ever witnessed. This is not the fifteenth century. I thought reason had replaced superstition. This is not an act of faith. This is the most primitive expression of ignorance I have ever seen. You... You... You have just killed Justine. How dare you. Damn you! Damn you! Release her. I'm taking this girl with me, before you kill her, as you killed Justine. My Lord. Oh, my Christ. You were witness. How did this happen. Where is the love he spoke of, Mother? To cleanse her spirit you have destroyed her body. But the Lord will not abandon her soul, because it is pure. May he have mercy on you for all that you have done. Enough Sister. - Yes? Who is it. - Open the door please. - Doctor, what's happened? - She's been hurt. We must care for her. - How is she doctor? - She's alright. Bring the stethoscope. It's alright. Don't touch me. Nobody wants to hurt you. Everything's alright. Father... I'm scared. - Is anything wrong? - It's Alucarda. She had a nightmare. Don't be scared, darling. She just had a nightmare. Who is she? Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. It's only me. Daniela. You just had a bad dream. You're safe with us. Try to rest now. Can I stay with her for a little while father? Yes, darling, but not too long. I'll be downstairs if you need me. - Your father want to frighten me? - He doesn't Alucarda. - You were dreaming. - I'm afraid of dreams. The things I see are so real. My father is a good doctor. He'll cure you. - Have we ever met before? - I don't think so. Because... I do remember people's voices. - You are very pretty. - And you are beautiful. Please don't go. Stay with me. Rubbish, pure rubbish. - Who is it. - It's me doctor, Felipe. Something terrible has happened at the convent. - You've got to come. - But it's five in the morning. The Reverend Mother sent me. You are to come right away. I'm familiar with the terrible things at the convent. What is it now? She didn't say. Only that you had to come. I'll be right down. Thank God you've come, Dr. Hasley. Justine's shroud. - Who did this? - That's what we would like to know. She was brought here to be prepared for burial. She was here all night, until a few hours ago. - Who was with her? - Sister Veronica. - Where is she now? - We don't know doctor. The least you should have done was to say with her yourself. Doctor. Doctor, please. No one in the convent has been sleeping since Justine died. We have been flagellating ourselves as we flagellated Justine. - Then someone took Justine's body. - There's no other explanation. - I must notify the authorities. - No. They'll want to know how she died. - Our religious community. The scandal. - Don't worry. The death certificate will say Justine died of an unforeseen accident, which is partly true. Doctor, Mother Superior, Doctor. Come quickly. Oh, my God. She's been burned to death. It looks as if the fires of hell have reached her. Take her to the chapel. I want to look at the corpse again. - I'll go with you. - No. I want to examine it alone, if you don't mind. Take her to her cell. Father, what is the meaning of this? This nun was dead, and yet... She moved. The devil moved her limbs. She was dead. But the forces of evil had not abandoned her. How can you explain this from a scientific point of view? It happened, is happening in front of your very eyes. Do you still doubt? I don't know. You're the only one here who has the answer. These are the doings of the transgressor, The seducer, the enemy of virtue. The perpetual persecutor of innocence. The arch enemy of Almighty God. You mean... the devil? The devil. I still can't believe it. And yet this destruction was by someone who hates all religious manifestation. To that being, this chapel was a terrible antagonist. When I studied at the University of Paris, I was taught that demonic possession was pure nonsense. Or the sad result of the workings of an insane mind. They taught me that religion was a farce and a form of slavery. That the time has come to break the chains of superstition. I'm a man of reason. And I'm faced with something supernatural, which frightens me. This woman was dead. Yet there was evil inside her ready to come alive and attack the innocent. This could only be as you say, the work of what you call the devil. Yes. It was the devil, who entered our sister's body. And turned her from the altar of the Almighty to the fires of hell. - Someone must have contaminated her. - Justine. And we must find her... before there are more victims, more corpses, more possessed. Yes, we must find Justine, or what is left of her. You won't believe how things were. But that's why we exorcised Justine and Alucarda. They were possessed by the devil. Is that why Alucarda was at the ceremony? Her behaviour was evil, diabolical. - Oh, my God, no... Daniela. - Doctor Daniela?s alone with her. Daniela. Thank you father. - Mother Superior. Daniela's gone. - I understand. We must find them immediately or Daniela also will be possessed. - We'll all search for them. - Thank you Mother. - Are you ready Doctor? - Yes Father. We must find Alucarda. Where should we start looking? - I think I could help find her. - How would you know, sister Angelica. I remember some of the places they used to go together. - Let's go then. - Promise me you won't hurt her. - Please Doctor. - Don't worry. This way doctor. Mother Superior, please bring Father Lazarus. - Yes doctor. - Sister Theresa, where's your cross? I've lost it. Thank you sister. Doctor. They used to come here. There seems to be another way out. Come on Brother Felipe. Please, no! Justine. Oh, God. Justine. You're just killing her. Doctor... Alucarda... The convent. Alucarda at the convent. Of course. That would be the last place we would look for her. She must be there. Burn them. Burn them. Lucifer. Burn them. Doctor, what's happening? Alucarda! Take her out. Satan. Let it down. Lucifer. Alucarda, please. Daniela. God the Father commands thee. God the Holy Ghost commands thee. Subtitles: Corvusalbus
