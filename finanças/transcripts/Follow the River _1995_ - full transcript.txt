No sleep again, love? I slept. She did not. You're very sure 'tis a girl. Mother is sure, and since when has my mother been wrong? Will you mind a girl, Mr. Ingles? I'd not mind a dozen if they're as pretty as you. You wore a strange look before I spoke. Will the world end today? Oh, I think not. Yet I do feel something. - I'll stay home. - You will not. The fencing can wait. Go to your fences. The farm's a more demanding mistress than I. No mistress for me, my Mary. I've all I need in you. The birds are Up and I am up, And please may I have my oatmeal? Pa, can I help today? You're not big enough to be building fences yet. But you can help Gran pick blueberries. After you've fed the chickens. And collected the eggs. Morning, Mary. Will I be an uncle again today? She's having her strange feelings again. Not about the baby. You'll take care in the fields? Yes. Until sundown then, lovely wife. Tommy, help your ma now. Alright. Ten times, ten Times ten away Across the Ocean blue Oh ten times Ten times ten away I'm coming Home to you Look at the mountains yonder, Tommy, and just pretend that all that space between there and here is water. Now suppose you came across that water-- In a boat. Aye. Now how many times that far do we go in the boat? Ten. And ten times that and ten times that. And no tree or hill to be seen. And you come to a wee place called-- Ireland. Good boy, Tommy. Ireland. Where your grandfather, George Draper, and I come from. Good morning, Mr. Harmon. Mrs. Ingles. You leave some of that water for me, Betty Draper. I'd give a guinea for my mother's big copper kettle. If I had a guinea. Maybe the peddler will have one when he passes again. I'm wet with sweat and frozen to the elbows. You'd best get finished before Casper sees you or you'll get nothing more done. Be kind, Mary. He's lonely since Alice died. Though he does talk. That he does. That he does. Ah, Mrs. Draper. Do you remember I told you that my dear sweet Alice first came to these shores in 1743? Well, I was mistaken. It was 1742-- Mary! Ellie! Oh my God, Mary! Hold there, John. Thought I heard a gunshot. It's likely my belly growling for hoecake. Maybe Mary's started her labor. My sister's no sort to fetch you from the field 'cause she's having a baby, Will. Not unless she's having trouble. She was feeling strange this morning. She gets those feelings. She's tougher than you and me put together. Like as not she'll have the baby at her breast and be splitting firewood with her free hand by the time we get home. There again. Do you not hear it? I've got it in me to run up to look on her. I'll be back. Don't eat my food. As you will, Will, as you will. Mrs. Ingles! Mr. Lenard! Ma! Ma! Tommy! Mat-tah! Nee-gah. Mother. Will walk. Eee-yah diero. Betty, how are you? I'm dying. Don't say that! We're going to be alright, Bett. I feel it. I want to die, Mary. Tommy, you let your auntie die, I'll give you a good hiding. Hear me? Yes, ma, I hear you. Thank you, Mrs. Ingles. You're welcome, Mr. Lenard. Will we stay here, sir? Up there. Don't die, Aunt Bettie, don't die. Paradise below for a camp, and they put us in an eagle's nest. It's safe from pursuit, that's why. We must remember it so we can find our way back in case Will and Johnny-- Who is to follow, Mary? Have some sense. They're all dead. Not Will and Johnny. I'd know. They killed the Colonel and Casper. And maybe your ma, God forbid. But Jim Cull lit out for the woods, and Miz Lybrook knows we passed by. They're all dead, I tell you! You don't know that! Now let's take a look at that arm. I'm afraid I'll have to tear the sleeve off your dress. It's alright. Tommy, thank you for not letting your auntie die. You did a fine job. You're a good lad. Op-chee, ageena koh. Are you not afraid, Mrs. Ingles? Of course I'm afraid. Mother always said, "Know thine enemy" and "Never let them see you are afraid." I fully intend to do both. They could be gone to the devil by now. Why can't we start at first light? Mr. Ingles, there are but six of us, against how many Shawnee? There are men coming from upriver to aid us, and I need my scout. We should have gone after them. We should never have let them go. By now we'd be dead as Mr. Barrier, God rest his soul. Be easy, John. I'm as anxious to leave as you. Wake up, Tommy. I don't care how much we hurt, Bett. I do care, but let's be still and bear it. Once we're to wherever we're going, we'll scream our heads off but not so long as we're surrounded by nervous savages. So stand up, darling. And help your mother up. Be proud. Stand tall. Right you are, Mrs. Ingles, dignity it is. Sir, can you not lead him by his hands? I know. Mother. You not do. I need comfrey and willow bark. Mother! Be still. See? Thank you. Weh-sah. Weh-sah? Does that mean comfrey? Weh-sah is good, strong. Weh-sah! May you burn in eternal hellfire for what you've done to us, but may the devil give you a moment's respite for this kindness. Moccasins. Here. And there. They'll be following the creek to the New River, I'd lay odds on it. They will not follow the New River. They will travel where our horses cannot go. North. And then west. Captain, the trail is already cold enough. I do share your urgency, but I advise caution. I'll not lead these men into an ambush, not if King George himself were hostage. She's a beauty. I thought the little jill'd never turn you loose. Poor little tad, first thing she'll feel in this life is a mosquito bite. Here, pretty one, that's quite a head of hair you have. It's Will Ingles' hair. What shall we call you, my love? Elenor, for my mother. And Bettie, for your brave and kind auntie. Bettie Elenor. That has a fine sound. What do you think of that, my Will? Now you've got the daughter you've always wanted and she's beautiful. Mother. Come. She can't move yet. If I don't move now, I'll not be moving again. For heaven's sake, you'll bleed to death! They won't wait, Bett. They'll kill us all and go on without hindrance. Now help me up. Mother come. Mother weh-sah. Weh-sah. Diero. Nee-gah. Wee-sah. Not make big voice. Shawnee mother-- Strong. Weh-sah. Shawnee mother. Surely not. Just squats, gives birth, and then goes on with her life? Eh-see. Maybe I'll try that next time. That heathen has his eye on you. And you like it. I'll thank you not to talk rubbish, Bettie Draper. If you had some dignity, instead of whining, and put a smile on your face and not scowl at them like they're devils, they'd probably treat you better too. They killed the colonel and Casper and you laughed with them. Bett, I am trying to keep us alive! I hate them as much as you do, I know they'd kill us without a second thought. But if they come to think of us as not afraid of them, it'll maybe give us a chance to survive! We can't shut each other out. We've nothing but each other. And all is not lost, love. Johnny would never let you go. They stayed here days ago. Betty's dress sleeve. It's got blood on it. But no dead bodies. Let's move on. But I caution you, Mr. Ingles, I have some experience with the Shawnee. While they have great respect for courage, they have no patience for the sick or the wounded. Come on. Mary, how will we ever get home? If there's a way to somewhere, there's likewise a way back. All we must do is follow the river. Can I try? Nee-gah. Ah-reen. Mom, can Little Cloud teach me a game with the ball? Please, Mom? Which one is Little Cloud? The one with the ball. How do you know his name? We pointed, "little cloud." I told him my name is To-mas. He's nice, Ma. Please, can I? Aye. Go play your game, To-mas. Thanks, Mom. He'll be a proper little savage all too soon if you ask me. Better a savage than dead. He's six years old, Bett. The Indian is just a lad. Let them play. Bah-bay-sah. Bah-bay-sah. Bah-bay-sah. Baby? Bah-bay-sah. Thank you. Weh-sah. Very weh-sah indeed. Bay-oh. Tommy. Wake up. We have to move on. One thing to be said for all this walking. It'll help you regain your figure quicker. If it's regained your sense of humor back, it's worth it. Aye, Mary, it's been gone a while. How far do you reckon we've come? Ten times ten times ten away Well, Betty, love, now we are truly in their world. Remember, Bett. Let John be proud. I will, Mary. Thomas, stop that noise or I'll tan your hide, you hear me? Dignity it is, Thomas. Thank you, Mr. Lenard. Thank you, Tommy. You're a good lad. Ja, zeer goed. Ja, zeer goed. I am "ungry." Angry? Yes, I reckon-- Neen, not "angry", hungry. They not feed. I am old woman. I need eat. From vere you come? The Blue Ridge. Ah. And you? Fort Duquesne. You know it? Injuns fight vit Francemens, all British army killed. One, two months ago. All dead. Your name is? Mary. Mary Ingles. I am Gretel, vidow of Herr Stumpf. How do you do then, Gretel. Though tis not much of a place to meet. No. What will happen next, do you think? I not know, Mary Ingles. But nothing good, I think. M'sieur, I regret, but you must run, comprenez? Run to the big lodge and bow to the chief. If you fall, you run again. Savez? Go! Vite! Vite! Alright, you big Injun! Hunh! Ha! Pas! No! She's an old woman! You can't! Gretel, run! Go! It's not so bad. You can do it. No, I will do it! Nee-kee. Mother be still. She will run. Sir, my sister is sick and wounded! I will got twice! Once in her stead! Ah-ho. Mary, you have more nerve than the devil himself. Welcome. Thank you. You speak English. Yes. You welcome. You eat. Then sleep. I never thought venison could taste so good. I have so little milk for her. It's fennel seed, Mary. For you, madame. Monsieur, thank you. It is all there? Bon. It is old, non? A beautiful thing. It belongs to my mother. She's a fine seamstress. Ah. Oui. And you? I manage. How may I repay you, sir? I have nothing. There is something. She is my wife, madame. It is difficult to explain. Madame, my wife's baby, my baby, a son, il est mort. Less than a week ago. He died. I'm so sorry. Tis a hard thing to lose a child. Merci, you are kind. Red Leaf, the old woman with who you stay, she tell me, us, that your baby is hungry. So, I think, perhaps? But she's an Indian. Oui, madame. They too have children. Amazing, is it not? Your box will be sent in the morning. Trois. Un, deux, trois, madame. Madame. Monsieur, forgive me. I'd be very grateful to your wife. Merci. No, it is I who thank you. To cover you, when you sew. Madame. S'il vous plait. It was bon chance he find you. Another man, who knows? They call him "Chat Sauvage." How do you say, Wildcat? He is Kispokotha, a great war chief, and he thinks you are brave. Weh-sah. Good. That is why he sends you to his mother. Red Leaf is his mother? Yes, Indians have mothers too. She's a grand dame, Red Leaf. A Lenni-Lanape taken in war by the father of Wildcat. She is wise. He does you great honor to send you to her. A word of advice, Mary. I know these people. We are, how do you say, allies. They are brave, tres genereux, tres tres gentile. Serve them well. For you are here toujours. Toujours? What does that mean? It means you are here forever. And so we, er, propose to do commerce with you. We will be, er, partners. Do you agree, madame? Agree to what, monsieur? LaPlante? Madame? I'm sure you have discussed this. You will make les chemises, shirts for us to sell. You sew for us, we supply the fabric, and you will share in what we make. And how much will you pay? Elle dit, "combien?" For every ten shirts you make, we give you one fine wool blanket. I'll not sew ten for that! Four. Sacre bleu, non! Eight. Six! And I want the silver bracelets you buy from the Shawnee. But why? You cannot eat silver. It is not warm. It is no use here. One blanket, for six shirts. And my sister is to have the same work when her arm is healed. Eh bien. Six shirts it is. Nee-gah. I walk her with? Mattah, Otter Girl. Say, "I walk with her." I walk with her. Go for your walk. I'll never understand these people. How can she let LaPlante crawl all over her? It makes me sick. How is she going to stop him? She's his wife. Aye. I wonder what minister made that wedding. And what about you and your traffic with them, Mary? Letting your baby be suckled by a heathen! I have told you. Her own child is dead. Will would die of shame! Will would see that I have no milk! And without my "trafficking," you'd likely be dead too by now. I wish I were! Blast you for a sniveling, ungrateful witch! I wish you were too! Mother is good? As well as can be expected, sir. Considering my circumstance. And yourself? I am good. I wanted to thank you, I'm very grateful, me and my sister both, that is, for all your kindness. Your mother has been a wonderful woman to take such care of my baby, she arranged for my baby to have a wet nurse, and-- Stop. Mom, do you like Wildcat? He has been kind. Little Cloud says Wildcat is the bravest of all the war chiefs. And his ah'shemah's to marry Wildcat when she's big. What was that word you used? Ah'shemah, his sister. Of course she's only 10. Will we ever see Pa again? Yes, Thomas. We will. Someday we'll go home. All of us. You and me. And the baby. And Aunt Bettie. I'm glad. It's fine here, but I sure would like to sleep in my own bed again. And you shall, Thomas. I promise. Captain, even I can tell we're following our own spore. I admit it. The trail is cold. They're ahead of us somewhere. Somewhere? You could hide five armies in this valley. I regret we must turn back, gentlemen. My condolences. Then we'll go on alone. Now that'd be suicide. He's right, Johnny. But there must be another way, perhaps ransom. Shawnee do not talk of White man. They are enemies. The Cherokee sometimes trade with Whites. Might not they speak to the Shawnee on our behalf? I know a man. His name is Snake Stick. He's more Shawnee than Cherokee. So I warn you, he may be difficult to persuade. I reckon he'll have his price. You're talking madness. It is my wife and son and sister-in-law I speak of. Sir--will you take us to him? Tell him if can ransom my family, there will be gifts for him, horses, cattle. Anything. Please. Please. Coat. I beg your pardon? Coat. Coat. Must hold. Oh, you want a shirt for yourself, is that it? There should be one your size. Not this. Mmm, must be like-- Wildcat. Wildcat coat. Oh, it's a bespoke shirt, you're after. A dandy we are now then. Very well. I'll measure you. Be still. You not do. I did not mean to mock, sir. Hear me. Mother good blood. Children good blood. Pe-eh-wah, come with me to Kispoke Town. You cannot know what you ask. I will be father to your son. He will be nenothtu, a warrior, not slave. He will be neequithah. My son. My--my son already has a father. No! No! Go with him! No, no! Mary, no! God, no! As long as we're alive, there's a chance! No, God! Your sister has fine man. Piqua Shawnee, a council leader! She go to lodge upriver. You stay with us to make les chemises, n'est pas? You cannot buy me! Mais, madame, we have so done. For deux chevaux--two horse, two blanket. We own you now. For the old one, widow Stumpf, we give but one blanket. Buying and selling us like cattle! You'll never own me! I take. Sir, please. He is mine. You've been kind to us. Is this your revenge because I would not go with you? It is done. Ma! Tommy! Ma! Don't let him take me! No!! Tommy!! Gretel! I want to go home. I want to go home to Will! It's not funny, Mary. But we can do it! You talk mad. Stop it. They've set us to foraging, have they not? We leave the village right after dawn. We return at nightfall. Why not keep on going instead of going back? We'd have a day's start. We would starve. There are nuts, grapes, berries. Plenty for us to eat! But no meat. The men have meat. Our things are added only. It's crazy talk, Mary Ingles. I don't want to hear this. But you could go home, to your kitchen and bake honeycakes. I have no kitchen. No home. It burn. All my family dead but me. Then come with me. Come to Draper's Meadows. Live with Will and me. The baby. It cries. They hear this. We'd be miles gone before they knew. All we must do is follow the river. Come. We must work. Mary. You must leave the baby. No. Yes. First she would die. Then me. Then you. Better that than live like this. It's true. So, I must think. It's too late to think now. I will know in the morning. Gretel, when we go back, you will not tell them what I mean to do? You think I tell them? You hurt me, Mary Ingles. Bon nuit, mon ami. He is now yours. Dorm'bien, Goulart. I will wait for you, Marie. There is time. You are young. You will come to me. She's-- It's used to you now. A good life, she will have. Not slave. Shawnee she will be. I had no choice. Thank you. Not one hour I sleep all night. I say yah, nay, yah, nay, yah, nay. By dawn time I am so weary I say nay, nay, nay. But come sunrise, at you I look and I say, yah. Yah, I go. In a while, I go. Because I cannot let Mary Ingles go alone. I, too, thought all night. About the baby. Well, enough of this idling, Mrs. Stumpf. Come, we have sassafras to gather. There's a fine tool to do it with. Monsieur, we need your ax to cut sassafras. It is sharp. You will take care. You can be sure of that. Thank you. Your arms. They are bleeding. Aye, from fighting with berry canes so you can fill your bellies. Eh bien Marie, you must fight back. But take care. We must not lose you, mon cho. Mary. I thought I was ready. Who could be ready for this? She is your baby. Come. We forget this. No. I have to go home. I have to go home to Will. Come. Come. They can't hear you now. That's it. Good girl. Yah. Good girl. Good girl. It's the first time in so long that we are free. Yah. Come dear, and step lightly. We're going home. You think Jack has found this Snake Stick? Why has he not returned? It's been days, Will. Why do you have the look of Mary when she's feeling strange? Do I? She used to say we could read each other's minds. Least she could usually tell what I was thinking. I wish-- I want her to know that we've not given up, John. That's all. I am mad to listen to you! Gretel, we've come many many miles with no hurt to speak of. I hurt! But we're free, dear! We're free as birds. Free as birds. And do you know how free bird is? Always a bird is here for a seed, here for a gnat, here for a fly, and that is all he do, all day long. Free as a bird. Aye, it is like I said then. We really are free as birds. And what if there is another creek, and another river? Then we cross them! We cross them all! Look, is bridge. Come, come. No, Gretel! Yes! Come. You are young but I am strong. I take you home. Come. Be careful, is slippery. Careful here, Mary, it's difficult. Why did I listen to you? If I not listen to you, I be in warm Indian house with fire and not this cold river. Gretel, I know where we are! Oh, good! Down there, it's where they let us bathe. Now we are truly halfway home. And at the end of the day he'd rub my feet. I can still see his hands now, big, and solid. With that fine dark hair, and the blue veins under his skin. Such hands has my Will. So strong and yet so gentle. I was good-looking then. Like you. All the young men wanted me to come to the party to dance. But the kitchen of my mother-- was where I wanted to be. It was big and warm and--safe--always, with copper pots and spoons, hanging from great black beams. And ach, the smells! Cheese in cloths, and butter in churns, and huge ovens that smelled always of fresh baked bread. Stop! Have mercy, woman! You're caressing me at one end and torturing me at the other. You are all I have in the world now, Mary. All I have in the world. Mary, please! Very well. We'll rest here. Lord knows I'm tired enough to sleep and never wake. Mary, we are lost, no? We cannot be. If we don't eat soon, I will die. No. I won't let you die, Gretel. We will share the blanket. If you give me your word you'll let me have it back at my turn. I give my word. I have seen my cousins the Shawnee and they have told me what is in their hearts. They had a good life. But then they were forced from the south to the O-he-oh lands, where they had to learn to live all over again. They took up the tomahawk against the English because they were driven from their lands. They will not give up their captives easy. You must know that they adopt captives to replace Shawnee people killed by white men. I know that. I regret what has passed but we seek fair exchange for our families. Cherokee too love their families, but Snake Stick not happy with what you ask. Not proud to go to Shawnee brothers to talk for English. They will ask, "If you so close to English to speak, why do you not kill him?" I reckon you'd tell them the Cherokee are not at war with the English. Plus that's my whiskey you're drinking. Now sir, do you wish to hear my proposition or not? English talk. Good. Ask your Shawnee brothers for a woman named Mary Ingles, her son Thomas, and another woman, Bettie Draper. They were taken from a settlement near--Jack? Chi-no-da-se-pe. New River. Mer Englis, son To-mas, Betah Daper. And a man, Henry Lenard. No! Shawnee not sell English man. At war with English man. Let the Shawnee decide. Carry the message. Damn squirrels! Everything gone. Now we have 11. We'll find another, it just needs patience. Give me the ax. I'll do it. No, I'll do it. I can do it. Give it to me! I know you out there! And when I find you, I eat you raw! Gretel! Not enough. Find your own tree! Then you find your own blanket. No, I am sorry. Here, I give you some. I'll not eat wood. You hear me now. I have a purpose. I'm longing for a faraway place and a husband who waits there. I'll not be stopped by starving or sickness or hurt. Nor will I be stopped by a woman who's got no purpose, who's ruled only by her gut, for she's nothing to go home to. Eating wood. You'll be eating worms next. I'd rather eat worms than the worms eat me! Mary, Mary! Mary! Mary! Don't leave me! Mary, no farther, please. I know it's hard, Gretel, but we're getting closer. I no have to do what you say. I die from doing what you say. You'll die if you stay here. No, I die from listening to you! I am sorry. I not mean. I not hit you again, Mary. I promise. You better not try, Gretel. Because if we're to reach home, we have to do it together. Get that greasy carcass of yours out of my path. Move, you clod! You do that to me once more, I kill you! You've nothing to kill me with but your bare hands! We have to cross here, Gretel! Maybe we'll find some more berries over there! I want no more berries! Well, we've not had much luck at fishing. I want no more fish! Maybe I eat you, Mary Ingles! No, wait, Mary! No! Mary! Come back! Mary, no, don't leave me here! No! No! Mary! No! Mary! Mary! Mary! I am sorry! I want us friends! Like before! It is best that we're apart. You have your side, and I have mine! Did you find food, dear? A root! Mary, please! Be my friend! We must be on our way! Gretel! Please! Lord, I don't think I can go on. Quit your whining, Mary Ingles. Just keep moving. Just keep moving. Have to pray, have to pray. Why? What's to be thankful for? Lord, you could've been kinder! Not that I'm telling you your business! I--I must-- must remember. Must remember Will. I must pray. I must pray or I'll never get home. I must pray or I'll never get home. I'm coming home, Will. I'm coming home, Will. I'm coming home. It's a woman. Could it be Mary Ingles? Mr. Harmon-- Save your strength, Ma'am. I can't say much for my skills at nursing, but we've sent for Miz Lybrook. My mother? Passed on, ma'am. It was not the massacre. It was more like grief, I'm thinking. And Will? Will's not here. Him and Johnny went looking for ye amongst the Injuns. They ain't come back. I'm real sorry, ma'am. When you were across the river from me, my heart, Mary, was more empty than my belly. I know, dear. Mine was too. Oh, Gretel. No two souls were ever closer than you and me. And now you're all I have left. Miz Lybrook says that woman eats like three men and a horse together. She was kind to take her in. Gretel is a good soul. There's young Adam with fresh beef. Will! Let's get this over with, there's just two of us to hear. What happened to Tommy? He was taken by a chief to raise as a warrior. Taken I don't know where. And the other? She was born in the forest. Six days after the massacre. I carried her, and fed her, until I had no more milk. And then? And then I had to leave her with a wetnurse. She'd have perished. You can see that by the sight of me. Did you give this girl-child a name? I did. But you are not to know it. And I intend to forget it as quick as I can. That's as it should be. Have you nothing to say to me? When they took off with you, I had to run the other way. And that's as it should be. If you'd been fool enough to run into a massacre, where would you be now? We're right where we were seven years back, Mary. Just us two. And I love you more, Will Ingles. Is that true, Mary Ingles? I have proof. I am here, am I not? Will!! Ma! Tommy! Ba-bay-sah. Thank you. Sir, why have you done this? Your wife-- is nenothtu. A warrior. I do this for her. To-mas. Tanakia. Farewell, sir. Tanakia.
