Be strong. There's always light the next day. It was so good to have you here. So sorry for your loss. I appreciate that. - Thank you. - You're okay? Tell Doug to call me if he needs anything. I will. If you need anything, please let me know. Just call me if you need anything. Thank you. Just as she would have wanted it. I appreciate it, thank you. You know, what you did was illegal. I'm the executor of her will. Me. Not you. Not Edith, not your grandparents. Who survived the Holocaust. And you wanted to tell them that their Jewish granddaughter would be cremated? That's what she wanted! She wanted a lot of things that she shouldn't have. Whatever happened to honoring the dead? Funerals are for the living. I'm living, aren't I? Yes, exactly, I am living. And your grandparents, as venerable and as adorable as they may be, they've got about five years left between them, tops, whereas I now have to live the rest of my life knowing that I failed her. Even in something as basic as cremation, - I failed her. - Doug, it was either deal with your anger or do with their anger, and, terror, just more of them. Please. This is hard for me, too. Oh! Just kicking. Oh! You want me to make you some tea, huh? Get you a heating pad, run you a bath? It would be much easier if I knew what was wrong with you. Yeah, run me a bath. She just wrote, "Fuck you." Do you understand what kind of doghouse you've put me into? Yes. Can you imagine if you were pregnant, and your baby daddy just didn't show for the anatomy scan? Yes. It's a pretty damn important one, you know. It's like where they find out about heart defects and stuff. Yes, I know what it is. I guess if I were more thoughtful, I would have gone to the ER at the same hospital as her OB-GYN so you could have done both. Well, at least tell me what happened... Forget it. I shouldn't have listed you as my emergency contact. They wouldn't let me leave by myself. They actually would if you sign a bunch more papers. Great, I'll know that for next time. That what? Next time that what? It was a kidney stone. Oh, okay. Yeah, sorry. It wasn't a bullet wound or anything. No, no, my uncle had one of those. They had to, like, jackhammer it up with a laser. Okay, well. It's over. How do you feel now? You need me to help? No. I'll just, I'll take that bath. Go. Look, my flight is at 10, so... Charter school? Oh, yeah. You didn't tell me you got the charter school story. Hey, I got the charter school story. So, if you start to feel worse, you promise me you'll call your sister? Her baby's fine. She would have called you. Look, my flight is at 10. You didn't tell me you got the charter school story. Hey, I got the charter school story. So if you start to feel worse... I'll take that bath. Go. I'll take that bath. Go. I'll take that bath. Go. Go. Well, this is what happens when you bury people, Kira. They can come back to haunt you. It's in the Bible. He wasn't buried. Well, he wasn't cremated either. Maybe you should talk to someone, hm? I've been talking to Dr. Levine about it. It really helps. I got it. This looks like it might be something. We need to cancel her accounts and all that stuff. I'll take credit cards, you take utilities. Wait, we should take a picture before we touch anything. The police already did. Still. You okay? Yeah, I just need a moment. Here, lie down. Guess who called me? Dad? I know, he called me too. I didn't answer, obviously. Well, I didn't answer either. But then I did. He's in Mexico. - God! - Yeah. Yeah, says his trucking venture went bust. Let me guess. The guys he teamed up with cheated him? Ran off with the shipment. And he needs money. You got it. Don't tell me you're giving it to him. I don't know. I'm telling you. He did share an interesting factoid with me. Oh, yeah? Turns out someone gave him money back in March. And you swore you wouldn't. - And now you're giving me a guilt trip... - Okay, okay! for even thinking about it. Fine! Shit. What happened to the money I gave him in March? Idunno. Why didn't you ask him that? 'Cause I didn't want him to lie. Hm, how noble of you. Anyway, I already sent it. Aw, Inez! I said it was from both of us. And I said it was the last time. Fuck! How much was it? Five thousand. You don't have to give me half. I don't want to give you half. And you don't have that kind of money. I do. Okay, so you do now, but... You have to be careful. I know. Any interviews? Any dates? - There is this one guy. - Oh, yeah? He the sharpest knife in the drawer. And also... What? He was uncircumcised. So? Kira, we're Jews. I don't want to put something un-kosher in my mouth. You eat bacon-wrapped scallops. Have you ever been with anyone uncircumcised? Uh, no. Okay, well, you go do it and then get back to me. You know, most of the world is uncircumcised. I'm not planning on sleeping with most of the world. I dunno, isn't it supposed to be better for something? Like what, concealing stuff? Like, for some aspect of sex. Kira, it's like this. So, I think that could be sexy. Yeah? Mm-hm. Hey, baby. Hm? Hey. Hey, baby. No, don't slap my face. Don't be like that, don't be like that. Just kiss me. Stop, stop, oh my god, stop! Kiss it! Don't you dare, no! Kiss my foreskin. Kiss it. No, stop it! Oh, Doug. This is my sister, Kira. - Hi. - Hi. We were just... Sure. Doug is the guy from AA I told you I was bringing. Oh, right. Hey. Hi. Hi. She loaned this to you for that Great Gatsby party, remember? And she made you the little hair thingy with the liltle veil? Kira? What? Oh, it's clean. They cleaned it, see? And that was the leak? You can hear Angela in the downstairs apartment? Angela found her. Why does she have wine? Oh, she started drinking again, responsibly. Responsibly? That was like months ago, before Louis. We haven't exactly been tight, if you haven't noticed. Yours? Yeah. She always kept a stash for me. You want? It's 10:00 a.m. They're non-alcoholic! Mm. Louis' stuff. This is what she did before killing herself? Going through old pictures and packing up ex-boyfriend's clothes, instead of writing a note like a normal person? Should we give this stuff back to him? Fuck him. He sucks. You remember him at your birthday party? Oh, fuck him. This scarf, though, is nice. Mm-hm. Maybe..? - It's really super soft though. - Nope. Stop, give me the scarf. Her credit report? I don't know. Whoa! Ugh. George took that. Mr. Small, our guidance counselor. What? Yeah, they had a thing. He got fired. I hope he went to jail! No, she was 17. It's legal in New York State. I did run into him in the city about 10 years ago. Turns out he's a psychologist. Hope he's not a child psychologist. Here's a list of therapists who take our insurance, organized by patient satisfaction rating and distance. You are the most wonderful human that ever lived. You're working on that charter school story tonight? Yeah. Can you pick up some boxes after? So, Doug, tell me a bit about why you're here. Well... I've been having trouble sleeping. It's both insomnia and um... restless sleep. Like, like super vivid dreams. And I know why. Um. It's because my friend died. My best friend, actually. Do grownups even saying stuff like that, my best friend? Her. Cancer? Razor blades. Were you together? No. I'm, I'm with her sister. That's right, she had a sister. Twins. We're actually having a baby. But such different girls. Fraternal. Sororal, I guess. Is that a real word? Yes, it's a real word. - Yeah. - Yep, it's real. Believe it or not, I joined the public school system to make a difference. I just wanted to help kids. You didn't knock. So? So, go back outside and knock. Come in, please. So, do you know why you were sent here? Because I was causing a disturbance in art history. And how is that, exactly? I kept calling St. Francis a sissy. - What? - St. Francis of Assisi? But I kept saying, "a sissy." The Caravaggio painting? "St. Francis in Ecstasy?" Look, Inez, you're a bright girl. Why the constant acting out in class? Are you bored in class? I guess. Kids are generally bored because the work is too challenging and then they tune out. Or because they're not being challenged sufficiently. So, which one are you? You know which one you are. I have your transcript right in front of me. Then, why are you asking? Because I want to know if you are aware of your motivation. What does it matter? It's an AP class. That's as high as it goes. What if I told you we could sign you up for a college art history class next semester? If someone is too advanced for the AP class, and they're motivated and they're mature enough, we can... I really don't think I'm... mature enough. What, what is your deal, anyway? Are you punk? Are you grunge? I'm not anything. This is just my own style. You honestly think this getup is in any way original? I don't see how you're qualified to be a fashion critic. It's not about fashion. - Look, George. - Mr. Small. Look, Mr. Small, I see you're married. That's irrelevant. Oh, but it's not. Because you see, Mr. Small, I'd like to ask you, when's the last time your wife sucked you off? That long, huh? I sent her to detention. But gradually, day by day... Kelly, my wife at that time, was finding herself Inez's parents were divorcing. I think her father walked out, disappeared, so... How long did it last? Five months, maybe. And then? Oh, and then Kelly came back. Inez went nuts. She kept calling our house, and then she told the principal. Excuse me. The principal received an anonymous letter. She ran me out of town. I went back to school, finished my PhD. And... And you're still married? Oh, not to Kelly, no. We got divorced, two kids and four years later. Guess what I tried last night? Drugs? No. Anal. That's disgusting! You have to keep an open mind, Kira, or else, you'll end up repressed, like George's wife. Oh, shit. Our high school reunion. So you won't go. I guess I should email an obit to the alumni newsletter. Oh, and the Dartmouth magazine and Yale. I told the folks at AA last night. How did that go over? I mean, we couldn't help but wonder if this would have happened if she'd stayed in AA. If I'd made her stay. So I say I don't want to. I'm sick today. And he's like, "Fine. "Just one beer then." Can't say no to dad, you know, especially after he's had a few. So we cheers and I make like I'm taking a swig, but I don't. Actually poured it into a flower pot when they weren't looking. And later, dad's like, "Why does Elvis keep sniffing that fern?" This is the dog, Elvis. Look, I know I gotta tell him eventually, but apparently this weekend wasn't it. But I didn't drink. Thank you, Dennis. Now, Doug, you also wanted to share today? Yeah, yes, I do. So, I'm Doug, as most of you know. And I'm an alcoholic. Hi, Doug. I want talk to you about the moment when I realized that I needed help. I moved to New York to be a journalist. I was a copy editor for New York Magazine. My drink was Whiskey single malt, neat. Neat. Mmm. I like that term. It's like it implies that ice is messy. Yeah, well, look at the Titanic. Inez, I know it's your first day here. But we don't interrupt when someone is in the middle of sharing. - No, it's okay, T.J. - I'm sorry, Doug. It's okay, I thought it was funny. It doesn't matter if it's funny. So, I had a girlfriend named Laura. She also worked for New York Magazine. And after a couple of years together, she said, "Have you ever noticed that almost everyone else "in your department has been promoted and you haven't?" But that just made me drink more. And one day she left. And I thought, well, fine, good. There are plenty of women in this town, and I just kept it casual. And time goes by fast, real fast when you're drinking. And one day, I ran into Laura on the street. I saw her and she had two kids with her, and they were big kids, like tweens or something. And I thought, "Shit!" And she said, "Hey." She teaches at Columbia School of Journalism now. She said, "Are you still at the magazine?" I said, yes, which was a lie because they'd fired me like six months earlier. And the next morning, I wake up on the floor. No watch, no wallet, scraped knuckles. But actually, that had happened before. But there was this smell. There was this, like, sickly sweet smell. I had myself a blue-tongued skink. That's a lizard with a blue tongue. It literally looks like he's been sucking on a blue lollipop. And I named him Sergio and they can live like 20 years. And he'd been with me for like 10. And he was dead in the aquarium. That was the smell. He was... He was decomposing. I hadn't fed him in probably about a week, and God knows last time I'd cleaned his aquarium. Look, I know Sergio is just a lizard, but, unlike Laura, he couldn't complain and yell at me and pack his bags and leave. 'Cause just, I want, I need to have beings in my life who could depend on me. I want to have a family, I want kids. And that's when I called my friend, Mike, and said I needed help. And he brought me here. Thank you very much for sharing that with us. There's a school of thought that says alcoholics won't achieve success with the program unless we've experienced rock bottom. It's a bit of a controversial theory. But even if you subscribe to that theory, rock bottom can mean different things for different people. And now, let's talk about next month's bake sale. Yeah, it was harder than I thought it would be. You did great. Hey, Greg, come on over here. Hi, sorry again about that interjection. Oh, my God, it's really no problem. It just seems like everyone else takes themselves very seriously. Yeah, well, I think the goal is to be sincere. So, sarcasm is just kind of at odds with that. Anyway, since I'm supposed to pick a sponsor, I was wondering if it could be you. Oh, wow, thanks. Um... I think you should have a female sponsor. Yeah, that's what T.J. said, too. But he also said there's no rule. So if you wanted to? I mean, I'm not hitting on you or anything. Yeah. It's just that I'm only three months sober, so, I think maybe you should talk to Martha. She's two years sober, I think. She's really nice. She was homeless. And we're both black. I'm Jewish, you know. My dad was black, my mom was Jewish. So I'm Blewish. Blewish. Look, I just get the sense from you, like you feel safe, you know? Can we just try it? If it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out. Nineteen. Thirty-six. And thirty-four-and-a-half. So, how exactly did that thing end with the guidance counselor? You think this is like mid-century or something? Like, did someone spot them together or? Someone tipped off the principal. Oh, yeah, who? Anonymous letter. And they never figured out who wrote it? I don't even really remember. What does it matter? George fled, left town. And then Inez put her head in the oven. Wait, what? She didn't know that oven gas hadn't been poisonous since the late 70s. Do the kitchen table? Wow, this all looks amazing. I should've brought more than just a six pack. No, no, no, no, no, that's great, really. And who's that? That's Biscuit. The girl who lives downstairs is away and also having her floors done. So Biscuit has to stay with me until the fumes die down. He talks back. Yikes, I hope I didn't say anything like, "Your mother is a whore." So, step nine. Amends. Super long list, starting with my sister. Twin sister, not identical. Do you guys have like a special twin connection? A little bit. There is this one time I got this super sharp pain in my side and turned out she'd broken her rib skiing. Oh, my God. I've always wondered, are twins better people, because you're born having to share? Well, clearly not. Maybe you'd be even worse if you weren't a twin. Well, my sister is definitely a better person than I am. How so? She never caused any trouble, unlike me. She always forgave me when I was an asshole to her. She never resented that certain things came easier to me than to her, you know, like boys and school and work. You should just meet her. Okay. What are you doing on the Fourth? Um... Great, we'll pencil you in. Okay. Oh, hey, by the way, I sold a story. - To that nature blog? - Yup. Oh, congrats! Cheers. It's my first check in a while. Mm. So... So, I wanted to celebrate by... asking you on a date. A date? Yes, so here's the thing. I really like you and obviously, I don't want to make this 13th-Stepping, or to interfere with any of the great progress that you've been making. So I've already talked to Martha about transferring over your sponsorship to her. And I can start going to the 79th Street meetings. That's just as close to my house. I thought you were my friend. I am your friend. Would anyone even be my friend if they didn't want to fuck me? Oh, my God, I'm sorry. You were helping me. I was getting better with you. Why I fuck up anything good that ever starts in my life? No, listen, I'm sorry. Forget everything I just said, please. I'll stay your sponsor. But that's not what you want. Yes, it is. I just want you to be happy, I swear. Come on, let's practice. - Now? - Yes. Okay, fine. Hi, my name is Inez. Hi, Inez. Yeah. So, I'm Inez, and I'm a drug addict and an alcoholic, I guess. And I'm... bipolar. I was always, I don't know. Something was always off, but I did good in school. I went to Dartmouth undergrad, Yale Law School, got a job at a top firm. The hours were insane, 80, 90. There was a lot of Ritalin going around to stay awake. And then in the few hours we had off, we hit it hard: booze, coke, speed, ecstasy, to cram 30 hours of living into three. I'm not saying this to get sympathy. I was making a lot of money. I was on partner track. About that time, I was diagnosed as bipolar. Initially it was a relief, because all those mood swings made sense. I was given tools to control them. But you really shouldn't mix those meds with alcohol. Let alone cocaine. I was dating this guy in banking, and he, well... it didn't work out. And that crushed me. I was at my firm's holiday party. I locked myself in the bathroom, and I did more coke than I'd ever done. I woke up in the hospital, handcuffed to the bed. You know... I also want to be able to have a kid. I want to be a good mom. Anyway, the charges were dropped and I did three months in rehab, and here I am. And we welcome you. Were you her one phone call? I was arrested, too. Oh, she didn't tell you about that part? Mm-mm. I had started a counsel position with her firm in September of that year, so we went to the holiday party together. I knew she was upset, but I had no idea... But why did you get arrested? There was cocaine in both purses. My arrest was expunged, but I lost that job, obviously. Well, you're better off in-house anyway. Yeah. I mean, those hours are insane. Yeah. She kind of did you a favor. Hi. Nah, I'll just wait till Sean gets here. Check this out. - Oh, no. - No, no, no, it feels good. I don't know, it's just numb. Oh, shit, be right back. Hi. I'm Valerie. I'm taking Sean's shift tonight. He should have texted you. Oh. Please. Yes, he did. Okay. Well. It's good to know that his business is in good hands. Hey, do you private parties? It would really depend. How about New Year's? I imagine that's a busy time for you. I'll have to check my schedule. What was that? That was the new Sean. Yeah, I get that. You said you were gonna be in Geneva through New Year's? Look, I don't ask you about your personal life. You are my personal life. I don't think this is a good time to have a relationship convo. Have you been seeing other women? Really? Have you been seeing other women? You and I never had a conversation about exclusivity. Well, it was certainly implied. Implied is not stated. As a lawyer, I think you'd know the difference. How many are there? When do you even do it? I met your mother! Please don't flip out on me. We've been dating for six months. - Yes. - Six months. Doesn't that mean anything? Yes, it does. It means that we work well together, because you share my hours. But we've talked about our dreams and settling down. No, dear. You talked about your dreams, and I listened to you, which is something most men don't do. But don't you want to slow down, start a family? I don't want to start a family with my coke buddy. Shit. Please don't do this. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm out. No, you can't. Tonight's important. - Inez, I'm... - No, John. Please, listen to me. I'm going to introduce you to Peter. I've told him all about you. He's gonna be there with his stick-up-her-ass wife. - Peter, what Peter? - Peter Cole. As in, senior partner Peter. As in, my partnership hinges on his perception of me, Peter. Then you don't want to ruin your makeup. John, please don't leave me. I need to appear normal, okay? The other minority woman in partner track has two kids, and I'm not even engaged. I think that's my final cue. Here. This was supposed to be for us. - Hey. - Hey. - You ready? - Yeah. You've been crying? Oh, come on, no. Hey, come on. Breathe. Okay? Yeah, okay, okay, I'm okay. You still want to go? Yeah, totally. It's going to be great, so great. I really, I'm totally ready. I'm so ready. - Are you sure you're okay? - Yeah. Can you tell? No. Seriously? No, you look great. I promise. Hey! How do I look? Oh, you look so great! Oh, that purse, though. What? It's nice. Why? Yeah? So much better. Mm-hmm. I think we need to take another look at all these. Like, what's this one? Oh, that was camp. And what happened there? I dunno. We tried archery. Did something significant happen? Doug, I don't know. What about this one? This was law school, probably. And? Doug, I don't know. I didn't go to Yale fucking law school. Okay, stop. This is weird. And you know, she can hear everything now, so. Oh, is she kicking? Why doesn't she ever do it for me? Because you're weirding her out. We're going home. Oh, don't cry. Oh, my God. What? Kidney stones, what? Why did she lie to me? Huh? Pelvic ultrasound and misoprostol aren't for kidney stones. That's what she told me, I swear. She had a miscarriage. I knew it. I knew we were going to get pregnant together so that our daughters would be as close to twins as possible. We've got to tell Louis. No. If she wanted him to know, she would have told him. Or maybe she didn't tell him, but then at the last minute, she decided that she did want him to know. That's why she packed all this stuff up for us to give to him and for us to tell him. There's meaning behind everything here. Don't you see that? I mean, this is her note. She's trying to communicate with us. Like she's trying to communicate through your dreams? Okay, look, why don't we just return his stuff to him and suss out what he knows? And then we can make the call whether to tell him. Damn, this guy sure has a thing for cashmere, huh? I hope she didn't induce it. Like, throw herself down the stairs or... drink something. Why would she have done that? I don't know. I don't know why I said that. I'm gonna start packing the kitchen. I'll take that bath. Go. Fuck charter schools. Inez? What did you do? - Just the table. - Oh, that's fine. That's fine, too. Oh, this is my boyfriend, Doug. - Hi there. - Hey. As I was saying, there's just, if you want to look, there's a little scratch there on the leg, that's it. It's just so much darker. It's just a lot darker than on the photographs. Sorry, I was the photographer. Oh, it's just we have these Danish chairs and... Yeah, but they're a lot lighter. - Sorry. - No problem. - I'll show you out. - Okay, thank you. Bye. I didn't know you're going to be here. Well, I didn't know you're going to be here either. I thought you had that interview with the teachers union lady. Um, she rescheduled. I was going to meet Louis. Really? We agreed. We didn't. Okay, well. It's happening. Okay. And Kira, I just don't think that it's right to be bringing people by here yet. You know we need to clear this place up by the 31st, right? Yeah, but I just think it's... It's like a little, I don't know, sacrilegious to be hawking furniture while she's still... while there's still unfinished business. And when will this business be finished? After Louis, will it be finished? I can't tell if this is... normal grief or something else. Well, you know, I could just as easily accuse you of being a little too good at coping. And Dr. Levine must be one hell of a shrink because you're totally Zen about this. Okay, Doug, what you don't seem to understand is I have had my entire lifetime to prepare for this. I remember her crying at night, growing up, hours and hours, night after night. And our parents would be in there trying to console her. I think that's what finally drove our dad away. Come on, that's a shitty thing to say. That's what happened. She had a talent for driving people apart, didn't she? I don't want to be here when he shows up. No, no, no way. No, no, no, I'm not going to. I'm just turning off the ringer. See? No, just... What if it's an emergency? What are the chances of it being an emergency? Well, if they're so low, just take the call so I can stop worrying and get hard again. What?! Is she okay? It's midnight, Inez. No, that's where you're wrong. I don't want to be disturbed, but I can't turn my ringer off because one never knows when you're having an actual emergency, so. No, you can't talk to him, he's busy. Goodbye. Jesus. Well, what was it? She had an epiphany. She might be manic, I should go over there. No, Doug, no. You're a good man and that's why I love you. But people take advantage. Last week, it was a spider. Tuesday, her cable went out. I mean, Doug, this is my last day in the cycle. Next month, I'm at the conference. We're going to blow two cycles. Okay, now don't be upset, but I quit AA. Now, I never actually had a problem with drinking. It was the coke mainly, and I haven't touched drugs since I got out of rehab, not even pot. But I have to be able to drink with dinner. I mean, first of all, first of all, it's fun. People are so boring without it, and I'm so boring without it. Secondly, if I don't drink with dinner, he's gonna know something's wrong with me and he definitely wouldn't date someone with a substance abuse problem. He's got a lot to deal breakers. Who? Louis. Who's Louis? He's my epiphany. I had this total breakthrough. Why have none of my relationships ever worked? Because I go for guys who leave me. But this time, get this, this time, I'm going for someone I never in a million years would ever get with. This guy, Louis, he was in love with me in college. He's like this nerd, this little nerdlet. And I found him on Facebook. I wasn't even looking for him. He just popped up through that wonderful algorithm. Then I met him, and now we're going to date. Great. See, I'm so far out of his league, he could never leave me. Do you even like this guy? This guy wants to settle down. This is my last chance to have a kid. You have time. Oh, right, how's it going for Kira? Is she on her 20th round of IVF? You don't have to be with a man to have a child. You want my kid to have a single mom who is bipolar? I've been through that, I wouldn't recommend it. Wait, Edith was bipolar? Mm-hm, never diagnosed, but most definitely. Why do you think my dad left? Hm. This guy Louis is so uptight about sex. He was like raised religious. He's only been with like five girls and he's got such a huge chip on his shoulder about it. Doesn't sound like you really like him. I like the idea of him. I'm thinking long-term. I'm thinking about what matters. I'm not really attracted to him, if that's what you mean. But, you know, bottle of wine and I can just close my eyes and think of England. 'Cause who cares about physical attraction? You know, that's good for six months, tops. It fades, that initial lust fades. It's overrated. Good looks are a smoke screen. Good-looking guys can't be nice. They don't need to be. Can good-looking girls be nice and not call in the middle of the night? I just wanted to run it by you. Look, I'm on thin ice with your sister. I really love her. Please don't fuck this up for me. Fine. I've reordered for you, but you've got to put it in your calendar for next month cause if you don't, your nerdlet will definitely realize that you have issues. Thank you. You're my savior. Mm-hm. I'm gonna be so normal, I'm gonna land this guy. I'm sorry for your loss. There should have been a blue scarf? Nope, no, no scarf. But she did put her credit report in there for some reason. Do you know why she'd want you to have that? Uh, actually, I gave her this. You're early. You got the test! It's my credit score. Citibank, Amex, student loans, why do you have my credit report? It's a full background check. I see. I didn't think anybody could just do that. I didn't do this. My dad did this. Asked his friend at the Bureau. Why? Because I was thinking of... A future together. Why are you using the past tense, Louis? You were arrested for possession of a Schedule Two narcotic! Everyone has a past. I don't. I got a parking ticket once, because the meter was broken. I'm running for public office, Inez. You're running for Democratic Precinct Committee Member. It's a stepping stone. You know, non-convicts don't show up after seven years, so pretty soon, that'll be gone. That's not even the main point. The main point is that you don't respect your body! I haven't touched drugs since then. It's not just about that. I, for example, have only been with six women. How many men have you been with? Your dad didn't tell you? You're not even remorseful. Come here. Come here. You feel bad about it, don't you? Don't you? Yes. I need your medical history. You just saw my blood test last week. Your full medical history. Ashkenazi test panel, everything. Well. I will save you the trouble. I'm bipolar. That's it, just like that? Would you marry someone with mental illness? She called me totally hysterical after you left. I ran over here, and Kira kicked me out. I'm sorry. You said that she thought that that was some kind of a test result? We, uh.... We took blood tests to stop using condoms. Her results came back; we were still waiting on mine. So you... You always used condoms with her? Obviously. Why? Was she pregnant? Well, it must have been another guy. As you may know, she had many. You know, Inez thought you were too unattractive to ever reject her. Maybe she should have tried you! What took you so long? Well, I did take a moment to get broken up with. What, no. Didn't you tell her Louis left me? Mm-hm. Shit, I'm sorry. I'll talk to her. I'll make everything okay. No, Inez, you don't make anything okay. You just fuck things up. God, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry. Wait. Was this full? Shit. If Kira can kick you out for helping a friend in a desperate situation, then she doesn't deserve you. And who does deserve me, Inez, hm? Nobody. Certainly not me. Come on. Come on. You're not so bad. - Yes, I am. - No, you're not. Yes, I am. Everybody has always left me. - I never left you. - You should have. - No. - Yes, you should. Stop it. Why would you stay with me? I fuck everything up. 'Cause you're... You're Blewish. And you really know how to insult a cat. And you... You're, you're interesting. Like, when I'm with you, it's just not going to be an average day. Whoa, no. You're drunk. I need you. Please, I really need you. I need you more than she does. Damn, don't sneak up on me. You need help lathering up? No. I think you do. Stop it, you gotta give me some space. Don't you want some of this? No, I just want to wash my ass in peace. How about some of this? I mean, I want some of that. What the fuck? Who said that? It's coming from that leak. Yo, who's up there? You're just going to speak to my woman like that? Oh, you lost your voice all of a sudden. Speak up. I'm coming up there. - Joe, don't. - I'm coming. Joe! Joe, Joe, stop. Joe, please! So, you're the big man here. Eavesdropping, dirty-talking, leaking her ceiling? Look, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Angela. I didn't mean anything by it. I was not trying to eavesdrop on purpose and I didn't leak her ceiling. Joe, this is where that lady died. Yeah, she leaked her ceiling. So what are you doing here? You know what, I don't know. To be honest, I don't know why I'm here. I thought I was trying to get some clarity, but everything's gotten a lot murkier. You better step on a super finish fixing the hole. Absolutely, I will. I will talk to him again. - Okay? - Okay. Hey, Angela. Sorry, we have to vacate by the 31st. I'm gonna need your set of keys. I never had keys to her apartment. But you found her that night. The door was open. Fuck charter schools. Inez? You can't go in in there. Why, what's in there? How long have you been here? Huh? When did you come here? I don't know. It was probably 3:00 or 4:00 a.m. Some guy named Vijay called. Said he hasn't heard from you in 10 days. That you're a week behind on that draft for the charter school thing. Why aren't you answering your phone? I guess I just didn't hear it. Doug, did you ever go see the therapist? Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did. So? Wasn't a good fit. Doug, I want you to come home with me now. No. Why? I don't know. She's dead. She's dead. There is nothing anyone could have done. We all love her, we miss her, but she's dead! Okay?! You're glad she's dead. I'm not glad she's dead! I understand why she's dead. And you refuse to understand it, even though she is trying to explain it to you. It is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. It's a permanent problem. The way she saw the world was a permanent problem. She couldn't deal with... with it. So, what? So, some guy broke her heart. So what? It happens to everyone. Everyone moves on. People move on, from rape, from divorce, from being paralyzed. She couldn't deal with anything that ever happened to her, so she just suffered. And she made others suffer with her. Well, she's done suffering now. Yeah, that's what she wanted. She wanted to stop suffering. You don't have to keep your phone on at night anymore. You won't have to worry whether she went off of her meds or not. You don't have to share my... Attention. Doug, please. Please, you have to get out of here. Please come home. We need you. Don't use the pregnant "we." That's not fair. Fine. Fine. I have to get out of here. And I am bringing somebody to look at the bed tomorrow. And don't ever, ever walk out on a woman when she's sleeping, especially when she's pregnant. I don't want to see you. Give me those. Seriously, only Doug should have a set. I'm pregnant. Go, Doug. Inez! You've never done IVF, but it's fucking hell. The first two batches didn't stick. And I'm so scared about this one. Doug and I were trying to work it out, but, you know, we're both so volatile and, yeah, I'm really sorry, but I asked him not to see you. Just until it's born. Just let us have this baby. Thanks, thank you. Are you pregnant? Why did you say that? I don't know, it's just... Well, I'm not. Because if you are, you can come to me to discuss your options. My options? Well, I'm not. - Okay. - Okay. Don't go. Inez? Inez? Please stay. Just stay. Stay with me. Why didn't you tell me? - I would have... - You would have what? Held my hand during the abortion? I would have helped you do whatever you wanted. Of course, I would. I swear I would have been there for you. Please, believe me. What do I have to do to make you believe me? You can come with me now. Come up to heaven with me. We can live in heaven with our little girl. Be there for me now. Be there for her. I don't think you can be in heaven. You killed yourself. No. Judaism is really chill about that. Don't go. Don't go. No, Inez, wait. I'm coming. Kira, she's... Inez, I know you were with Doug today. He missed our NT scan. You gotta stop her. Baby's healthy, if anyone cares. I don't care if you're in the bath. We need to talk. Inez. 9-1-1, what's your emergency? Hello, this is 9-1-1. What's your emergency? Can you hear me? What do you want? I want some more hot water. You thought I'd be a bad mom. Kids turn out how they turn out. Yo, who said you could use my perfume? A big bubble. Right there. Right in here. Right up these stairs. Come on in. What did you do? Kira, were you here that night? What night? That night. Were you here the night that she got pregnant? I've hit bottom. I need help. I'll help you. I need help. I need help!
