Did you finish practising? Yes master. Chakri! Karate, kung Fu & kick boxing which you are practising now. Do you know the real motto of these martial arts? Non-violence! Ahimsa (Non-violence) Yes But, for the people who keep watching & who are interested in fighting This is an art of war. It is a great learning to the people who knows the importance of it. This is an art for self-defence. Where is Rohit? Rohit! Why do you practise so much to fight against a local guy? Local fellow? Yes, that government college guy Chakri. Here, hold like this. Do it correctly! Do you know why I like Kick boxing so much? - Why? Blood! I like the blood & pain which is visible in the opponent by our punch power. Looks like government folks are practising hard. - But for which child is play? Not everyone who practises becomes a champion. Model college guys are heroes. Government college guys are Zeroes. Look! Be sportive towards sports. And do not try to create rivalry between colleges. We will get to know who the winner is in the coming match. You are a better lecturer than a coach. No man can defeat model college while I am here. Impossible! As your parents are rich, you will definitely be arrogant & say so. It is confirm that Chakri is going to win this year. Only then model college guys will realize what government college is. So, Mr Surya, How far did you guys practise? Mr Vishwanathan, Your son is the champion in this upcoming inter college championship. There is no doubt about it! No, no, not just inter college championship but also on a national level. That is my ambition. My son should achieve what I could not do. It will definitely happen! Consider what I am saying is the truth. You came! Was thinking why are not you here yet. You always come & go when he is here, would you tell what is the connection between you both. Actually, Without seeing Mr Vishwanathan.. You do not feel like having coffee or breakfast. You are correct. Moreover, we are friends even before this canteen was put up. So, you are dependent on him since then. It is going to be like this, if you treat a cook as your family member. Excuse me, this dialogue should be said by him & not you. What difference does it make? Anyhow, get Bournvita in this flask, & Horlicks in this for my second wife. Where did I keep it? And in this. - I understood, milk for your kids. What else! Greetings Master! - Greetings Chakri! May you long live! He is a well-mannered man, serves coffee & clean the cups. Not just that, he also serves without hesitating to his college mates if they are here. That is why, I wish to have a son like him if I get married at this age. But, why not like his second son? He is okay & he is mischievous. I do not want like him. What Sudha! Did you prepare good at least for this semester? What preparation! As India is not into semi finals I prepared for science instead of maths. Will you at least pass this time? I can only write but cannot guarantee it. Hi Subramanyam! - Subhash! What son! You are here with plasters all over you. Why did you come in this condition? It is exam day sir. Oh my goodness. Come! Nowadays kids are wasting their parents money just like that. Whereas you are here directly from hospital to write the exam. You are not an ordinary man. Andhra student! You are an Andhra student. Sit carefully. If any nail there, will have to plaster your back as well. Sir! Will you write Om for me? You are unable to write Om & how will you write the exam? It is a small sentiment sir. You have got me with your sentiment. It is a great thing that you are here directly from the hospital. Not just Om, I will write everything & give. Give me the pen. It is perfect! All the best. Yes dear, you look like a very intelligent student. How come you failed exams in march? As there was not a proper supervisor. Why? What did he do? - He did not write Om properly. You have failed because he did not write Om properly? I have written it perfectly & you will pass. Hey! Have you made me write Om just to copy from this & write? Oh my goodness! He has a list of all chapters! What? What? You have kept this in your leg. Stand up on the chair! What? Are you dancing? Is this your leg or a garbage bin? It is Vikram Guide Sir. Let me see which chapter is where! Aurangzeb is history is in Manohar is pocket! What happened Sir? What son! You did everything you should not, & why have you kept your face like a milk drinking child. Here it is written that your pocket has Aurangzeb is history. Take it out. Hey Krishna! Am I Dushasan & is this a saree or what? Next! Chandragupta is family is in Shivanand shirt collar. Where is that idiot? What are you staring at? Will take out your eye balls! Take it out. I did not copy Sir & here is the proof. I will check. What is this? Looks like the belt on the dog is neck. Just the belt or do you have a chain too? I will show you proofs, I will show you proofs. Look! Look! Oh my goodness, what is this? It is like money falling in Tirupati hundi. Next! Weapons of Ancient is with Jumanji. Hey! Where is the face you idiot. It is better covered! Already our history is spoilt & you have spoiled it even more keeping it in under wear. You both are debarred. Get out. How dare that you copy, debar! Sir! - What? Why are you calling? Are you trying to bribe me? I will not take a single rupee. If so, take two rupees then. - Shut your mouth! Why did you hit me? We should be proud for having such a supervisor! Autograph please! I will not give to these idiots. It is only for you. - Thank you Sir. Keep it carefully for your entire life. He will keep! He will keep! Write down. To darling Kamala. - The Botany teacher. You still being a bachelor, & me with a dozen kids. I am thankful to you for agreeing to be my second setup. The decoration of the flat is not completed yet which I took for you. We will shift the moment it is done. Regards, Kameshwar Rao. With love, Kamesh. Is it Economics Kameshwar Rao? - No, it is English Kameshwar Rao. That means it is me. - Yes, it is you. That letter will be given to your wife if you debar us. And you will be divorced at this age. Hey! We are out two hours early. What shall we do? - Let us go to the internet coffee shop. We are not allowed in the internet shop & no cash to have a smoke. You innocent fellow, why to worry when we have Janaki as Reserve bank. The bad time is passed, shall we start now! He always starts when the class is about to finish in 10 minutes. The bell rings the moment he says the chapter name as usual. Today is chapter is Abhigyana Shakuntalam In this chapter... Hey! Who drew my sketch? Hi Jaanu! - Hi. It is you? - Yes! - Why have you come? Did you already finish your exam? I wanted to write, but they did not allow me. Copying again! You are stupid, the next attempt is march itself. That is okay! Jaanu! Jaanu! Jaanu! Give me a hundred. Why? To have fun near the internet shop with your friends. I do not have. - I am requesting you. It is better if you give if not, - If not? Hey Avadhanlu! Who is that calling like a classmate? It is Dushant Sir! - Very good, that you have reminded. In the beginning of the chapter, Dushant goes to his father & says. Daddy! Daddy! I want to go to the forest. He did not allow him to go. No, no, I will go to the forest and... I do not have, go! And I should believe this. Look, how will I get it! Dushant entered the forest with the same speed. The moment he entered a deer hopped towards him. Why are you all laughing? It is not English lady, it is Telugu lady. Then, he took his arrow & tried to aim at it. It did not come. He tried again, & it did not come again. He tried again & again, & still it did not come. He tried again. The hand came off and the arrow did not. But the arrow is still here. What is this? He looked behind as the slipped arrow was still there itself. Nobody is there, the arrow is not stuck too & he tried again. It did not come, tried again & again, it did not come, so he tried harder! Look! - Give dear! Do I not know about my Jaanu, 10120 rupees with this since 5th class. Mother, Will I fall on you purposely? It happened accidentally! I will complain to the principal. - No! No! Mother. Why do you complain to the principal? My match has been fixed recently. What shall I do now? Did I do anything wrong? See you later Avadhanlu! - Okay bye! When did this Subramanyam come? After the bad time passed Sir. - Then it is definitely his job. Please trust what I am saying! Hi friends! You are putting a scar every minute. Where did you come from? - Punjab! Punjab? - Yes! I had a barber shop there for a year, & later realized that it is waste to keep a barber shop in Punjab. Or a cool drink shop in Kashmir! I want to go inside. This is for model college boys & not for government college guys. I will explain you about the Andhra student I will wear different attire that no one can imagine Lovely girls are our target We do not care about the risk We create a new sensation By saying our student life is best none can compete with us Will do whatever he likes, like an Andhra student Ruff and tuff is our motto, playing rough is Mannerism We challenge that we are Fashion guys Height is waste what we wear is the best I do not care if you will not understand I will be life in every street I will steal all your hearts We will show our dare and make place in your heart You will fly high like a rocket if someone loves you Hey Subbu! I am feeling hungry, come soon. I am tensed whenever he cooks, his duty is to cook two days a week, & breaks half a dozen of plates & glasses every time he cooks. Hey elderly person, if I come there... No matter how many plates you break, your cooking is awesome. Your father is planning to make him the permanent cook in the canteen. I do not mind, but I am just thinking about you. Hey! That is not for us, it is for him, he likes this very much. Finish it. - Anyhow, he likes me a lot. Why does it taste so worse? Hey old man! You must stick to your words. You said it is great when I served this last week. Why do you say it is worse now? - Is this a week old curry? - Yes. If not, will I do specially for you? Just have it. Come daddy, food is cooked just now & it is hot. Even he is hot. You look so excited, did your exams go so good? I wrote everything without leaving a bit. You have started with Om it seems! Copying in exams, & blackmailing the supervisor, are not you ashamed of it? You missed it in March, thought you would read well & clear at least in September. I would have written well if I was not caught. Subbu! - Subbu! - We named him as Subramanyam & he calls himself as Subhash. He does not value the name given by the parents. He has a good name as Chakri! And me Subbu Subramanyam! I am unable to bare it. - Hey! That is your grandfather’s name. It is better to name schools & colleges by this name & not kids. You would have completed your second year, if you had shown this smartness in studies. Do not worry daddy, he will study. - And you! Why do you support him? It is because of you he is behaving like this. His friends are passing in first class & he is just roaming throughout the year. Going behind girls & just roaming with friends. You know to eat on time but not to study on time. Idiot! It is always like this. You always scold while eating. One must not believe the man who cries. I do not need this, I prepared this with hard work, you may eat. Eat. You also eat well. It will not digest. Hey son! Hey Subbu! What daddy? You scold him while eating. So that he would realize why is he eating & what is he doing! Super! Only you should prepare the mutton curry! Subbu likes this curry very much. Who that Subramanyam? Which curry does he not like? Why are you friends with him? Do not you have girls in your class? You always roam with his gang. And you do not listen if I tell you go & study at grandmother is place. What daddy! We both have grown up together. You did not grow together, but he grew being with you. You gave your slate when he broke his slate. And gave your books too. Also helped him with the fees. - Hi Kutumba Rao! Did you see, he is here on the right time! What Subramanyam! What is happening? - Subhash! What Sir came here at this time? Mother! Please give me something! These beggars have no other work. Actually, want to improve general knowledge by reading Hindi newspaper You will get fat & ugly by eating this meat. That is an English paper! Translation! Wash your hands Uncle. - Oh! Do not I know that? Keep the remaining curry in the fridge, can be used tomorrow morning. Keep it in deep freeze Jaanu. Do not chit-chat with him for long, come & sleep soon. I will also leave uncle, good night. Good night! Good night! - Good night Jaanu! He is doing too much. Oh my goodness! Come soon & sleep. - Okay! Okay! Hey! I came out of the house with pride, what happened to you guys? Did we participate in freedom fighting to receive awards, it is the same story in everybody is house. My father put me on the floor & bit me! Hey! Is your father mad? - Yes, he became mad after your dad bit him. Hey Jumanji! - What? Are you too thrown out of the house? I am getting hiccups since morning, so going to the hospital. Hiccups? - Yes! Shall I? - Go on! Why did you hit me? - Hiccups will vanish if you get shocks. But my father is getting hiccups, not me. You should say this before he hits you, do the same to your father he will not get hiccups in his life. Subbu, Why all this? This would have not happened if you study. You are spoiling being friends with these guys. What? Is he getting spoiled because of us? He is all by himself, he may spoil you too. Hey! Where are you going? - To give food to Subbu. He cannot starve for long. He cannot tolerate. Cannot he tolerate? Look there once. Hey you! Wherever you leave him, he will live as a king, he has got that talent. Why did you destroy it? Hey Subhash! Look behind once. What is it? - It is 1942 love story. In which theatre? - In bus stop theatre. Oh! You speaking about Shanti. Is it? Is my bro also watching? He is looking as he is watching cricket world cup. Is Shanti blushing? She is blushing like the actress Vijay shanti, you may look behind. In response to that he will give a short smile. Did he? He is smiling as Sachin Tendulkar in Colgate advertisement. Is Shanti also smiling now? She is laughing closing her eyes like film actress. That is it! They will not move an inch further. I am watching this love story since 7th class. Hey! How dare you throw a rocket to me? Wait! I will throw missiles at you. I mean half yearly exam marks papers. What is this dust? He already has dust allergy. This dust is from your head itself. You gave just 100 grams of answers for 1 Kg questions Now we will get to know what your history is! Firstly, as usual ladies first. Janaki! Like always you have got the first rank, & scored 92 out of 100. What happened to the rest 8 marks? The crow took it. - Oh! We thought it is father took it. Susheela! - Sushi! - Shut up!

On the day of exam, my mother asked me to wash clothes & go. Why? Is your father not at home? - No, he went to the camp. Say like this! Take it. You are the brave girl who washes clothes! You are the golden hand who washes utensils. That is super timing sir! Next! The zero Sarasvati. Come girl, come! Zero out of 100. You have raised your house name. Do not worry that you cannot study! Son! Calm down son! Shut your mouth! You are next, Kodanda Rama Manoharan! - That is me! 13 out of 100. What is this? You scored just 13 even if you copy from others? What shall I do if they do not study? Kodanda Rama is a small baby! Kodanda Rama is a small baby! Hey sit! You are doing too much! - You sit down! Say like this, I will sit. Now, it is a V.I.P. is paper, who is putting all his efforts to ruin this college Do you want to see the idiot Subramanyam’s paper? Yes, we want to see.

The final contestant is Chakri from Government College. The opponent is Rohit of Model College, the last year champion. Hey brother! Why are you like this? Because you lost the match? Shall I say something? Forget it! No use. Will have to say something special. Arjun! I mean Chakradhara, you have to be strong in such times. Will we destroy the theatre if the film is not good?

Round table conference with the Russian delegates. Next? Cancel all my programmes for my lovely sake. Lovely! When are we going to meet? 5 o clock? - Oh! How romantic! He is very dangerous! If we are not aware, he will sell my kidney to me itself. Jaanu! My lovely friend Jaanu! Where are you? Something happens! - Subbu! To whom is this rose for? I do not need it. Go & give it to some model girl. And they only need cars not flowers. Take it. What is that? - Is it not good? Turn! Cannot even keep a flower. Now you look like Titanic heroine. Is this Honda city? Yes why? Nothing, actually dad gave some work, so Okay let us go, I will also come along. If not you will tell stories while returning. You will also come? But your dress, my dress & car colour does not match. Shall I wear the dress which I wore on the festival day? - Yes do that! Hey Jaanu! You come to the canteen!

These are just stories & you believe all this? - Shut up! How dare you play with girls? Hey you Model college guy! Is this your father is place? It is for everybody, understand. How dare that he insults me! You should have seen his face when I said about Rita Meeta & Bata. Not just colours, he also changes characters. That I am not rich & am son of a canteen owner. Moreover, which is that cheap college? - You mean Government College? He will also say that I am a student of it. Lovely! Will get back in 5 min. I am coming from the service centre, your car is here ready. You disturb me while I am speaking to Foreign delegates. Security! Take the keys & throw him out. Subhash, why is he scolding you? Dad is always like this. Daddy? That means all this - Yes, it is our Palace. Sorry Lovely! I could not introduce as he was upset. He scolded me as I came late for the meeting. Sorry Subhash that you are delayed because of me. I do not know where I will be when. I may be in London tonight, & in Switzerland a day after, he tie ups with everybody & asks my signature for everything. Subhash! You are so simple even after being in such status. Even I feel like roaming with friends like you. That is why, I will come out like Gautama Buddha with plane cotton clothes someday. May I expect your support all the time? Subhash! Elders are always like that, we will have to adjust. Do not decide to leave all this in a hurry. It is very different today Do not know what went wrong May be its love Where everything I see I always imagine you Her smile is thrilling Did he fell in love? My heart is singing Love is playing with me. It is very different today It is strange, happiness I think this is love brother. I see her where ever I turn My heart is singing Feels like fresh air It knocked my door spoke to my heart The birds sang He is singing well Did you fall in love? Yes I fell You have started to sing, but does Lovely really love you? Tell! - If flower is given, that also means heart is given. Not just that, she said will meet tomorrow at Valentines day & tell something important. I will express my love too. If that really happens, those model college guys should roam in college wearing helmets. We will not wear helmets, but will cut your heads & make you unable to wear helmets. Look! Lovely is my girl, be careful if you enter unnecessarily. What will you do? - Hey! Hey Mister! What is happening? We will see you later. Should I say especially to you? Go! Does lovely really love you. Tell me. If you want to teach him a lesson, you & Lovely should definitely meet tomorrow. But do not propose her just with a flower. Anyhow you acted as you are son of a millionaire Take some costly gift along! 10000 Rs, why? To gift a beautiful diamond ring to my lover. Did your lover ask for such valuable gift? It is enough if you just give flowers. Flowers my foot! It is not an ordinary day tomorrow. It is Valentines day. Lovers say what is in their heart on that day. If you gift something valuable on such occasion, the range is completely different. Anyways, I do not have that much money. If you do not have money, Reserve bank also does not. Jaanu! Jaanu! Please Jaanu! You are always like this Subbu! Okay wait. Take it. Shall I say something, I feel you are born for me whenever you help me out. Bye Jaanu! Bye. Why this ring? When you are about to get a new one! Excuse me! Oh! Thank you brother! This is the correct match for me. What is the time? - Get lost! What Janaki! You said he will tell something on this day. He is still with those monkeys. - You wait. Shall we go shopping tomorrow? - Why? I have to shop a lot. By the way do you have a city bank card? I have a bus card. Catch this, I will go get the bus! This Manohar is never going to get a girl in this life. Every girl is booked! Subbu is the only guy whose love is going to be a success. I am tensed here & you are making me worry. Everything is okay, what is he tensed for? Hey! Look he is coming, all the best. Will you be my friend forever even if you do not like what I say? I Love you! I have bought this ring for you as a signature of our love. Is it enough if I say it like this? Correct! Please tell me! Look, she is here, wish me all the best, bye. Lovely! I Love you! - I love you too! Wait! Wait! Hello! Hello! Mic testing! Dear students of Government college, today our college name should be in the Guinness book. Since the time Subbu used to wear shorts, excuse me! To till date he has grown a lot. It is true that he did not cry when he was born, & said just Love. The proof is how he fooled Lovely. I am having tears in my eyes by looking at his simplicity. I want you all government students to take him as an example. We must get hold of the model college girls, And the boys should call us brother-in-laws! I request the Model college hero Subhash to speak a few words. Soda Please! - Would you not let me speak? May I speak now? - Yes! You may. I want to let you know what I have achieved is nothing & have to achieve much more. On this achievement, our college lover boy Shiva would like to honour him And is roaming with a four day old garland, I mean a fresh garland. Wherever you are come soon! Hail Big brother! A photograph please! - No photographs, leave! Now, on behalf of our college, it is A.R. Rahman musical night! You are the King of the Kings! May you live long forever! Jaanu! Jaanu! Jaanu! Jaanu! Hi Jaanu! Why are you still sleeping? Thought you would get ready neatly like a Mahalaxmi. Did you have your dad is drink by mistake yesterday night? And, how come you left yesterday without informing me, do you know how much I searched for you! Hi Jaanu! What happened dear? You have changed a lot Subbu! Have changed the hair style slightly & trimmed the moustache too. After all I am in love! I am very lucky to get lovely as my lover. Correct! I am only the unlucky one. Hey! What is wrong with you? Am I not unlucky if you do not introduce me to your friend lovely? Me proposing her & her accepting it, and then the diamond ring, it is so thrilling you know! It is thrilling to me as well. - Is it? You are talking continuously & could not make out that I am suffering fever Fever? It is boiling & how come he left you here alone? Common let us go to the hospital. I already visited the hospital. Okay! Did you take the tablets? You will not take them. Where are the tablets? Now take some rest & have fun. Okay! Subbu! Why are you leaving without asking for the car? That is true, but you... - It is okay, you can take it. You are not Mahalaxmi! You are Varalaxmi, who fulfils wishes. Hello S.R.Motors! - Daddy! - Janaki! What dear? Did your temperature increase even more? Nothing as such! - Then what is it? I will go live in grand mother is village. - Grandmother is village? Yes! I will go study there itself. Even you used to say the same. Yes, but why all of sudden? I do not feel like living here. I will go there & live. If you will to study there sincerely, what else do I require? You may go when you are okay, now take some rest. You said will give me a treat & just roaming the city, where are we going? I am searching for it. What? I think we missed the address, so searching for it. Yes! Got it. Subhash! Everything feels new to me here. It is the same for me too. But why so? You do know about me Lovely! Dad had forced me to come here. Anyways, where are the newly wedding couples? Let us go wish them. Yes, I am looking for that itself. Here they are! Hey brother! Congratulations man! She is Lovely! - Hi! Rohit! Lovely! Sorry Bro! Dad could not come as he is busy in a board meeting. By the way, who are you? Hello my son! Common! Common! Do not tell your mom that I am having a small peg, she might feel bad. Take care of my son. Subhash! Who is he? - I too do not know. Hey Mahesh uncle! Lovely doesn't know them. But I do not think Subha would be knowing them. Subhash! You are telling everyone your dad did not come, but he is here! My dad will not come like I do, - But he is here! This daddy! Ah... my daddy! Yes! - As he is here, we shall move! No! You go meet him right now, if not he might scold you for not attending the party. Greetings Sir! I have seen you somewhere! Car keys Sir! Hello my son! Are you steady? - Yes! - Are you not able to talk? Look my son, please do not tell anyone in the family that I drank a full bottle, especially me! Why are you calling yourself as my father? You are not my father! Am I not your father? - No! If so, you are not my son! Hello my son! Bloody drunkard! Did not even let me speak to my father. We got to know that some outsiders are in this party. It is better if they go out by themselves, if not we will have to throw them out. That means, they are having our drinks & also disturbing us! This is too much! Who is it? Is it you? Is it you? If there is some outsider here, it could be... None other than, myself! I am disturbed mentally, shall we go! Did you see how loud the heart beats? I would have got caught, if he was not there on time. Why do you hide Subbu? You can tell the truth to lovely! Will anything be left if I tell the truth? But if you keep hiding things, only the one who loses, will know the value of what is lost. You should not face such kind of situation. There is no doubt that lovely is deeply in love with me. But I am thinking how would she receive this. Okay! I will tell her the truth as you are asking me to tell. Subbu! - What? I am going to the town day after tomorrow. - Which town? Town of my grandmother. When will you get back? I am not going to return, I am going to study there itself. You took a nice decision, If so, I would be in trouble. What is the trouble if I will not be there? Chakri would help me with the money. But the car? Jaanu! Jaanu! Please tell your father to give me the car whenever I need. Okay! I did not introduce you to Lovely right, we both will come together to give you a send-off, bye! Hey Subhash! Generally lovers roam around parks & beaches But why did you get me here? To tell you the truth! - The truth? About what? I am not an engineering college student as you think, I am a Government college student. Not just that, I am not a millionaire is son, I am a simple man. I am a canteen owner is son! Lovely! I did not do all this to cheat you , I love you sincerely. I was afraid that you would not be with me, so I did all this. But I love you Lovely! Really I love you! Mad Subha! You thought I would get angry & leave you? I will just kill you! I will kill you! I got scared that you screamed all of sudden! Bad dream! - What? Did you dream a flight crash while going to a business trip? Almost like that! By the way Subha, What did you feel when you saw me for the first time? What is your first feeling? Oh gracious lovely walk Why are you in such hurry? Oh sweetheart amidst everyone Do not raise my heart beat Hey girl, your name is lovely Do not slide like a fish You look like a guava Please do not tempt me Have tried so many ways Oh lady does not bother I have tried many tricks for you, she does not bother I greet her casually She does not reciprocate Flouting her waist Look at her attitude Talk to our boy Please follow this lovely boy What is that I should do? To make this girl mine This girl falls for me Hey friends please advise me Is there any short cut? What is that, this girl needs How long should I wait Is it the height? But I am taller than her Does she knows about my status Kindly let her know If she smiles a bit She loves her wealth Is she looks at this youngster she will not lose her charm Please look at him once Please do not leave saying no Let him come closer to you Come on love him Come on love him Come on love him Come on love him Common Chakri fast! Chakri! Common! Common! Why are you getting so upset? Are you not able to practice with concentration? Chakri! You do not have to feel depressed for losing once. To be a winner, you must utilize your failures as stepping stones to success. If not, handover the canteen to Subbu & try practicing full time. What! If I do so he would change the shape of the canteen entirely within a day. That is why, I will handle it by myself. Hey Rohit! Advance bidding for Inter-college Kick boxing championship. Hey! Do you know who the opponent is? It is the kid Chakri who lost to him last year. Hey I bet you, that he will remove his hand or leg definitely. He will finish him. Hey! Rohit's mood is on Lovely & not on the match. Its on lovely. Hey! Look there! How come you are laughing while he is taking your candidate? I was wondering on how is he trapping Lovely, now I get it. Hi Subha! It is you! How come you in Subhash is car? I am here to tell you how Subhash is roaming in my car! Janaki! What daddy? I need to buy some spare parts urgently, & I am in short of 10000 Rs, The money which I gave on your birthday to buy bangles, If you give me that, I will return it to you in 2 days with interest. That... - What? I spent that money Daddy. What! You do not even spend 50 or 100 Rs, how come you spent 10000 Rs? That..., my friend Laxmi was in urgent need, so... Did you also learn to lie? You gave it to that Subramanyam right? To hide that, you are making stories that you gave it to Laxmi. I gave it to Subbu, but, but... - Shut up! I remained silent while he used to take 50 or 100, But now, he came to a stage to fool girls & take 10000 Rs, If we still remain silent, he will mortgage this house someday! I will ask, I will go ask his father! Daddy, do not daddy, uncle will not keep quiet if he gets to know. Do you think I will be silent? You just shut up! Daddy please! - Hey! You shut up! Hey Vishwanatham! Hey Vishwanatham! Come out once. What happened? - Do you want us to live here or not? Where is your younger son? - But what happened? This mad girl gave money to Subbu, thought would give him some more if it is not enough Daddy! - You shut up! Will hit you if you try to defend him. He cheated & took 10,000 Rs. - 10,000 Rs? But why did he require it? Not just thousands, lakhs are also not enough to the one who just roams You better control him. - I will speak to him. What will you speak? It is actually your mistake & not his. It is not enough to have kids, you must also grow them better. You must notice what all is he doing! Where is he? Hey girl! Will you not speak? Hey girl! Girl! Hey girl! Girl! Hey girl! Will you not speak? Hey girl! Girl! Hey girl! Girl! Hey girl! Will you not speak? Hey girl! Girl! Will you not speak? I will give 5 rs, buy flowers & keep it in your head! I will give 5 Rs, hey! Hey! Hey! I will give 5 Rs, buy flowers & keep it in your head! Hey girl! Hey girl! Will you not speak? Hey girl! Girl! Will you not speak? If you say yes! Hey! Hey! Hey! If you say yes! Hey! Hey! Hey! If you say yes, I will give my heart to you. Hey girl! Hey girl! Will you not speak? Hey girl! Girl! Will you not speak? How come Multi-millionaire Pramod Kumar's son Subhash is here? Oh! For time pass, is it? Lovely you! With factory workers, I am just... Shut up! - How more will you lie? You are a rascal of Government college & lied that you are an engineering student. You do not have a cycle & lied about cars, buildings, foreign trips & you cheated me in the name of love. It is true that I acted as a millionaire, but I did not tell you the truth as I was afraid that you would leave me. But my love is true! But why should I love you? Are you a merit student or a sports champion? What! What is happening here? Dad that... - Oh! So you are Vishwanatham! You have trained him nicely to trap a rich girl! Speak with respect! Respect! Being a canteen owner is son, your son told that he is a millionaire is son. What respect should I give to such people? Lovely, I will explain it to you. - What? That this is a drama & he is also not your father? We will lose our status if we speak to such people. Come let us go! Daddy! Lovely did not knew... You got my head down by taking 10,000 Rs from Janaki. And here, you cheated that girl & insulted us on the roads. Do not show me your face, get out! What? Should I tell you specially? I am not like them. Is it? Is this your father is park then? Jeans pant! T-shirt! Are you a thief? Must be a hustler! Nothing as such! - Hey just leave! Go! Hey leave! Just go! Go from here! Go! What Subbu? You forgot about us if uncle threw you out of the house. That you are roaming around parks. Come let us go! Common let us go! - Only you come inside! Subbu! His father threw him out & you got him here! His father just threw him out for what he did. Whereas, I would have killed him. As you were not seen, I thought you went to your friend’s place. But you went near him! Your train must have left. If you have no shame to bring him here, at least he should have had to not come here. Daddy please! Subbu! He left! Common, I will send you in some other train. Daddy! I have told you that I will go, but now I cannot go leaving Subbu in this condition. So, where will you go now? - I can take you to my place, but my people... It is okay, you may go! Where will you stay then? Subbu! Here! Have this! I am not hungry! - I know that you cannot control hunger. Subbu! My father should not have spoken like that. It is okay! - If you do not mind, shall I say something? What? - Actually, It is your mistake! You know that, what you are doing is wrong. And still you continue doing it. Anyone would react the same way as my father did. You walked off with attitude, but did not feel like apologising him for what you did? Chakri helps him a lot, & you made him loose his respect in front of all. It is useful to you & not to him, if you listen to him & study well. And if you become great, it is your benefit & not his. What will you achieve if you roam around with anger? Look how disgusting is your situation the moment you are separated from your father At least now, listen to your father & make him proud in front of all. I am telling you this as you would respect what I say. Please change your habits Subbu! Hello Sir! - Subhash! It is you, how come you are here? There are no college girls too. I thought of carrying the items. - Oh! They are already packed, the kid will be here 10 min, I will send it across. From now I will take it, the kid is not required. Oh! From now on you like to grab on this money as well? No! I would like to help him at least in this manner. It is okay, you may take it. Greetings Sir! - The guy who is taking the items... It is Subhash Sir, Vishwanatham’s son, as the kid is not here, he is taking his canteen is items by himself. You fool! He is a hustler, his father threw him out from the canteen yesterday itself. He will sell all this to another store & enjoy with the money. Go & catch him. Subhash! Hey Subhash! Stop right there! Give the items first. - Why? What happened? What is that power? I am going crazy by holding this. Probably Rohit might go mad in the battle. Chakri! Oh! You are practising! Look what I bought for you. Head guard & knee pads. I bought it for you from Mr Chandrasekhar as he was going to Delhi. Why all this now? I know what sportsman spirit is. New things always encourages. What else do I need if you grow from state level to national level. My son will fulfil my ambition! - Definitely Daddy! I will win this match. Not for me, you will win it at least for Shanti. Shanti! Shanti! Ah! I know about you both. But what you do not know is, that I and her father spoke to each other. Day after tomorrow is your engagement. - That means elders have agreed to the marriage. That is true! Also the phone rang! It is marriage time! - Hello! Yes it is me! That idiot will not let me live. - Who daddy? Your brother! He tried to hustle the items from the super market! Owner Sridhar caught him meanwhile, he says would have hand him over to the police if he was not my son Chakri! Trust me I did not go to hustle the items. I have made him loose his respect on the roads! I have realized now! I was scared to face him, so I thought of impressing him by doing some canteen is work. But they... - You are always like this kid. Always going in the wrong root. You should have fell on his feet, if you really wanted him to forgive you. Why did you try doing this? He is getting hot as fire by taking your name. Now what shall I do? - I would have given you a brilliant idea if you would have asked me before. You do not get tensed, there is a way to reduce his anger. What is it? - Day after tomorrow, me & Shanti are getting engaged. You & Shanti are getting engaged! Shanti is my Sister-in-law then, hey congrats dear! I will try to convince him in that function. - You do not worry kid. Look Brotherhood! Hey look! Thought of 5 star hotel getting Lovely. But look, he is not deserving a footpath too. What Subbu! Hey! Anyhow you know to clean cups. Try to get some job in a cheap hotel! If not, being low-class dreaming for a high-class. Look! Happened has happened! He is no more behind that girl now. You do not poke him unnecessarily! The elder one got angry if we poke the younger one. His arrogance did not reduce even after losing to Rohit! Do not show your talent here, it in the boxing ring! Understood? Please, do not attempt to fight. Hey! What will you do? Will you hit? Hit me! The joy has just started Happiness has stood in front of us The wedding has fixed, the house has enlightened It is like a blessing, which comes from mother I will always take care of you I will mot trouble you You have to enlighten the house like a daughter Everyone has to bless the couple in the marriage The knot has to be auspicious The moonlight will be the witness Hey Subhash! Hurry up! If not we might get delayed. Then.., Chakri's engagement? Engagement is tomorrow! He is dreaming as it already happened. Why did you hit me? - He is already in pain, you do not worry Chakri will definitely convince your father. How will I alone manage all the work? Canteen work, house work, outside work, now this engagement work! Malli! What is your problem? I have two hands & not hundred. It is better if a human helps another human! Tell me what help do you want? I will do it. Now we have to tie mango leaves to the doors, will you climb the tree or me? If Subbu is here, he would fill the entire house with mango leaves. I already told you not to take his name! Actually daddy, this is our first big occasion, it will be good if he is also here. He realized! From now on he will be good, I will guarantee it. Please do not say no daddy! I will go get him right away! Chakri! Listen to me! - Please daddy, I will go get him right now. - Hey Chakri! Hey Chakri! Do not look back, he is telling to get him back quickly. I think the curry is on fire! What Chakri! There is time for the match, if you are to fight, fight with me & not with my friends. Look! They have insulted my brother, that is why I taught them a lesson. Do not make this an issue unnecessarily. What issue? Sister! Check the blood pressure! His life is not in danger, but he might take 2 to 3 months to get up as his spinal cord is injured severely. I am also not sure about it. I know how many dreams you have on him. But I am sorry! Why did you come? To see how we are? Have a look at that girl! They should have been engaged by now! He always talks about you in every matter. He wanted you to attend his engagement even if I did not agree to it. And now... Hey! Did you at least do one good thing till now? - I will join my hands! - Daddy that... - No! You are not my son, I have only one son. Go! Go & die somewhere! Get out! Do not worry Subbu! Look Jaanu! What daddy is saying! That I am the reason for Chakri’s situation. No one used to say anything when I used to just roam. But now, they say I am the cause for everything! Calm down Subbu! Your dad has dreamt that he would rise his name with lots of respect. He could not handle himself after what happened to Chakri! He must have said that as he is worried. Do not mind for what he said, try to understand & get close to him. How is Chakri now? Is he conscious now? Not yet daddy! I am worried by looking at Vishwanatham Uncle. I could not see him with tears. Subbu's situation is even worse. It is okay if you go there for the sake of Chakri or Vishwanatham But you should not meet Subbu from now on! What are you saying Daddy? Are you asking me what? I am just telling you what you have hidden ! Did you get that idiot only to fall in love with? But, what did you see in him to love him? He is with you since childhood, took money from you & spent it on someone else Are you not pissed of him still? That you are still writing non-sense about him. Daddy! I loved Subbu! And not telling him is my mistake. He may love whomever he wants to, but Subbu will always be in my heart. There is improvement! But I do not think the wounds are caused just by accident. No Doctor, it is accident, I myself went into the wrong route. No problem! You get alright within next three months. The match is near, that means, Will I not be able to participate? Daddy! Why did not he respond? Chakri! Why all that now? We expect a lot to happen in life, but will that all happen? Daddy! - I know that you will win, but it happened this way! Think you have lost without participating. No Daddy! I have to attend the match at any cost. And fulfil your dreams. I know how hard you worked to make me a champion! I also know how proudly you used to say that I will win the match. At least for that, I will... But now, I do not have any aim or dream. You are here alive, that is enough! We clean cups in the canteen, why do we need a cup? You better forget about it. If so, it is not necessary to buy boxing gloves or head guard for me! Just buy one wheel chair for me. - Chakri! Yes Daddy! - What will I achieve now? You have dreamed a lot to see me as a boxer. Sorry Daddy! I am not able to fulfil your dreams! Chakri! - Sorry Daddy! I am not able to fulfil your dreams! You have dreamed a lot to see me as a boxer. Sorry Daddy! I am not able to fulfil your dreams! We clean cups in the canteen, why do we need a cup? What Subhash you are here? How is Chakri? - He is okay Sir. Anything else to speak? I want to participate instead of Chakri in this year is Kick boxing championship! If you start to train me, I will give my name in the college. I will learn sincerely, Please! Look Subhash! I can understand your pain! You may have taken this decision by looking at Chakri is Situation. But to learn Kick boxing, One should practise sincerely for years. I will be sincere. - You who roams behind girls without any responsibility will never get it! I will only teach to the sincere ones. Not to people like you! You may go. Sir! - Deciding will not work! Your life will be at risk if you participate without proper preparation. Subbu! You are very stubborn. Come! Subbu! What Sister, you are here? I want to speak to you in personal. Say sister! - What do you think about Janaki? Janaki? She always helped me since childhood. She is a great friend, who would also give her life for my sake! Being a girl, I am saying this as I understand her heart. You are not just a friend to her. You mean everything to her! Yes! Janaki loves you since she knows you. Lovely choose the Subhash with status, cars & bungalows But, it is status for Janaki only if you are beside her. She tried to go away from you, after knowing that you love Lovely. But she could not leave you in this situation. It is true Subbu! As she can't go against her dad, is suffering every moment as she cannot live without seeing you. It is always better to be loved by someone, than loving someone. Think it over Subbu! Dear Janaki, you are very lucky, the boy agreed by seeing your photo. It is a great match, he is a software engineer in America, earns 2 lakhs per month. As he has not got leaves, he wants to confirm this match on the coming 10th! What do you say? Are you listening? I am telling it to you! I also told you long back, Only Subbu will be in my heart forever! If you still continue to do all this, You may lose your daughter! Uncle! How come you are here! I am here to ask about you, as you are my would be son-in-law. Yes! Subbu is my life! I do not mind him loving someone else But I will always love him, this is what she says! Hey! You tell me, will any father agree to give her daughter to an idiot & a vagabond like you? Tell, will any father agree? No, will not agree! You cannot even feed her one time, & will any father agree? Never! Hey! Janaki always lived for your sake since childhood If you want her happiness, tell her to accept to marry to the America guy Only you can convince her. She will only listen to you! Subbu! Are you also asking me to accept this match! If not, is the groom a vagabond like me? He is a nice guy it seems! Elders always say for our betterment. It is you who told me, that it is better if we listen to them. If you have any respect to my words, please agree to it Jaanu! Okay Subbu! I always wanted you to be the champion. I want to see you winning the cup & become a champion, then I will leave. How are you? What! As you are not participating, you are training your brother & sending him My brother? You could not withstand my punch power, how come that kid Subbu will? Keep a bed ready beside you for his sake! You & your brother can rest together! I have done this to you, for just touching my friends He is trying to compete me, ask him to be careful with his life! Why is he here? Why is he threatening to kill ? Shanti! Ask Subbu to meet me urgently wherever he is. Why? He is about to fight against Rohit. I have to stop him. Our Subbu! If so, I think he is going to achieve what you wanted to! You do not know about Rohit! He will do anything to win. He is the one responsible for me being in this situation! He made the accident on the day I was going to meet Subbu! I hide this, as where Subbu will loose control on this & loose his life. Shanti! At any cost I shall stop him from fighting! Is everything there for tomorrow’s occasion? - Yes we have! You should not repent tomorrow! There cannot be anyone else than Subbu in my heart, But I know that he is never going to be mine. And I cannot live with the person whom you want me to get married to. There is only one solution to this, my death! Subbu! Dad! Dad! Subbu! Dad! Ask him to stop! Subbu! Subbu! Stop it! I believe that you have changed into a good person. Yes really! You do not risk your life for my sake, stop it! Subbu! Listen to me, stop it, please! Subbu! Common Subbu! Janaki! Dear Janaki! Chakri! This cup is yours! Daddy! Subhash! I am your Subbu Daddy! Subbu! Janaki! Jaanu! You want to make me lonely and leave this world all alone? Please do forgive me for not Understanding you! I truly love you Jaanu!
