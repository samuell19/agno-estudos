--== McEphie ==-- [gentle music playing] [man] According to a census, at least 11 million people live in Metro Manila. With all these people, how would you be able to tell who is the one for you? What if you passed by them already but you didn't notice? You were probably busy tying your shoelaces when she walked by. He might have stood beside you when you checked the traffic light. You might have seen her in front of you, had it not been for the pedicab. Among everyone here, some have been lucky to find the one for them. Some are still searching. Others have given up. [mimicking motorcycle noise] [man] But the worst of them all is if you already found the one, but you let them go. [sighs] Imagine this… If the one for you comes just once in your life, would you pass this up even if they're in front of you? How many sets? Ten boxes? [laughs] -[applause] -Thank you! That's all it takes! It's that simple. Just remember this… The moment the doors open for you, that's your only opportunity. You grab that chance and make that sale! Because if you don't, you'll have a hard time in the second time. Or worse, you won't have any chance at all. [phone ringing] -Thank you! -Thank you, Apollo Ganuelas, Klaro's Division Head from 2008 to 2010, -who just arrived from Davao. -I'm on the way! The traffic's bad! Hey. I'll see you, okay? I'll just text him to say we're about to start. -Where is he? -He might've turned off his phone. He's not replying. -We can't just wait for him. -He's late again. -Apollo! -We'll do without my best man. -Hey, wait! I'm here! -There he is! -Apollo! -There he is! l made it, bro! Ouch. [solemn, gentle music playing] -Congratulations, son. -Thanks, Mom. Hey, handsome. [chuckles] Yeah! [chuckles] [gentle music continues] -[camera shutter clicks] -[crowd cheering] [Ken] I've never understood why it takes so much effort just to drink your wine. You're jealous because you'll never marry! -I love being married. -What? [crowd] Kiss! [cheering] So sweet. -Okay, our turn! -All right, your turn. -Not in front of everyone! -One, two… -[Ken] Come on. -[both giggling] -Show some passion. -[giggling] -Is that a couple's kiss? -Now, I'm really envious! Me, too! Hey! Count me in! -[Ken] There, the one in pink. -[Apollo] One. -[Eric] Standing? -[Ken] With the headband! -[Apollo] I said one. -[Ken] Your standard's too high. How about the petite Chinese? [Apollo] Two. [Ken] How about this one. This should be okay for you. -Three. -Okay, one more. -Finally! He went past two! -Three, bro? -Okay, go for her! -Go! -Later. -[Maia] Picture time! -There, let's take a picture. -Picture time! -Let's take pictures! -Any luck? -Guy's too picky. -[photographer] One, two, three! I don't think he's really looking for someone. [camera shutter clicks] Maybe he's already found her, he just doesn't know it! -I knew it! -Who could that be? I think I know her, is it the teacher? -She was caring! -Yes, the teacher! Here you go, Cedric! Hmm! Delicious, right? Marco, here, l promised you some! There you go. Hmm, yummy! She cared for him so much, she ended up treating him like a baby. [friends laughing] -Your turn! -No, thanks. -It's yummy. -No, I'll pass. Please? -Come on, just a tiny bite. -I said no. -No. -Please? [laughing] I was thinking it could be Miss Perfect? What a waste. It used to be so beautiful here. The Philippines was the number one country in Asia. Everyone wanted to travel here. And he ended up being Mr. Imperfect with her. Really? How could you not know that? -[both laughing] -[Eric] There's another one. The stewardess! She took you to heaven, right? Helicopter style! [door banging] [playful music] She was like a dream. She'd take off before he'd wake up. [glass clanging] -[all laugh] -Oh, my! Oh, I know! What about the MMA fighter? The tough girl! She was really hot! [whoops] Rawr. Oh, her? Didn't she turn him into a rag doll? [friends laugh] [both grunt] -[bone cracking] -[grunts] [groaning] Ken! [overlapping chatter] [Eric] But someone came before all of them. -What? -Really? The photographer. [Apollo] No. She might turn me into fertilizer. -There we go. -Come on, let's just eat. Eric, l spotted a couple of girls over there. Let's play basketball. [indistinct chatter] [playful music] I made it! Not too shabby. -She'll do. -There you go. -Did you see the connection? -Told you. There, one more time. Just a little bit more. -There it is. -Right. They gazed at each other. Oh. Oops. Not possible. Not gonna happen, bro. [buzzer rings] ["Mahal Kita Kasi" instrumental playing] [buzzer rings] Ouch! That hurt… [buzzer rings] Chibu Manalac. I have two kids… But no wife. [buzzer rings] -Hi, I'm Eric. -I'm Jackie. With a C or a K? Oh, both. -Jackie! -[buzzer rings] -Hi. -I'm Jackie. I'm 22 years old from Quezon City. I'm the third of four siblings. [camera shutter clicks] [woman] Hey, you're not listening! I said I'm the third of four siblings. [buzzer rings] Jan! Jan! Okay, game! Is it okay? -Hey, you're married! -Just engaged! You can't say no, bro. Wow. It's like looking down a crevice. Hi. I'm Apollo. Uhm… -I'm not part of this. -It's okay. It's not important. I want to know if you believe in love at first sight? No. [chuckles] ["Mahal Kita Kasi" playing] What about second sight? Yeah! -Right? -[soft chuckle] [Apollo chuckles] I knew it. I'm a camera. -Why? -Because I can make you smile! You know what? You might not go home tonight. Why? Because you're already in my mind! [both laugh] -Uh oh, -Yeah. Just like lice. Already in my head. You're a piss… Because I can't hold you back. If you were a ball, I'd never be able to shoot you. Because you would always miss me? [chuckling] You're a piece of crap. What? I could never play with you. [laughs] -I've never been compared to crap. -[laughs] [chuckles] I'm Apollo. Irene! I'm Irene. ["Mahal Kita Kasi" by Nicole Hyala playing] Thank you, Lord. All l asked for was bread, but you gave me burger. And with fries! [wheezing] [exhales] I'm introducing him to Mom and Dad! -They don't speak a lot. -What? Here they are! My mom and dad. This is my mother. Her thigh. Her nails. Here you go, Mikey! -Hey, wait up! -I'm in! -I'm in, too! Ready, one, two. -Come on, Pops, smile! -Wait! -One, two, three! -[camera shutter clicks] Yay! My turn! -Wait! -Okay, okay! Okay! -[camera shutter clicks] -Take a good one! [clicks] [camera clicks] [camera clicks] [camera shutter clicks] -Hold on! -[laughter] Put me down. Come here, Pops! Just the two of us! One, two, three! [camera clicks] Okay, miss, we'll get it. Really? [squealing] Thank you! I love you. Open, open! Come on! Go! Go! [camera clicks] ["Mahal Kita Kasi" continues] [camera shutter clicks] Go, go, go! [camera clicks] [camera clicks] [camera clicks] [camera clicks] Yes! At least they're only 20 points ahead! At least it's just 20 points. Hey. Rematch! Come on, battle of looks! [rival team jeering] -We win! -Not even close! [chuckling] They're not even close. -Bye! See you! -Okay! [Jan] We'll be back for our future! ["Mahal Kita Kasi" continues playing] [sniffing] Hmm! -Smells good? -No. -Smells bad? -No. It smells like… It smells like you. Just like that. [sniffing] There! That's it! Hmm! Hmm! Hmm! [giggling] -[indistinct chatter] -[both gasp] [whistling] Let's go home. Come on. -Let's go? -Okay. -Wait! -Why? Hold on. You gave this to me. Come on! [squealing] Come on, come on, come on. Hmm! Hmm! Ouch! Hey! That's burning me already! -May I see? -There. Oh, my. Better now. ["Mahal Kita Kasi" continues playing] [both chuckle] -Wanna go back to being curly? -Am I crazy? [rain pouring] -Hold it. -Let's go. Here. Give me that. Also that. Here. Come on! My darling's feet can't get wet, let's go! -Wait! Wait! Are you crazy? -[whooping] -Wait, wait. -What's that? -Your hair will get wet. -[laughs] [both laughing] [Irene squeals] Since we have an umbrella, let's stay a little bit longer here under the rain! -[squeals] -[laughs] I'm so dashing. -Hmm. -Oh. [sniffs] I wish you were a bottle of perfume. So I can wear you every day! What if I don't want you wearing anything? -Yes? -Hold on. Stay right there. [growls] [Apollo] Oh… Is that what you want? Okay. Here I come! I can't see you but I can smell you! -Really? -[chuckles] [moans] Whoa. [both softly chuckling] [giggles] [singsong] [giggles] [breathing heavily] -It's cold. -What? Pol, Pol, it's cold! I'm freezing! -[shivering] -Oh, no! Pol, it's really cold! [heavy breathing, wheezing] -[heavy breathing] -[shushes] [heavy breathing continues] [inhales] [exhales, inhales] Hold it. [exhales] [breathes normally] [gentle music playing] Sorry. It's okay. Next time. [kisses] [delicate music playing] Will you marry me? [gargles] [soft chuckle] Say that again? [gentle romantic music plays] When I was a boy, my mom would always scold me. Because I was always so forgetful. So, what she does is… tie a string around my finger. And she'd make me wear it all day. So whenever I'd see it… I would always remember what she'd tell me. This is to make you remember that on this day… I asked you if you wanted to marry me. Only if you want to. [soft chuckle] [pants] So I will never forget the person who gave me happiness. [both chuckle] Yes. Yes. Yes. [indistinct chatter] Go, girl! [romantic music plays] [indistinct chatter] [chortles] No one in their right mind would park this way. [chuckles] What happened to you last night? You suddenly disappeared. The alcohol was so strong I got drunk immediately. We understand. We know you're allergic to weddings. [kid] Can I buy a lollipop? Bro, I'm sorry for reminding you about Irene last night. Who told you I was thinking of Irene? Thank you. [gentle music plays] You okay, dude? Yes! I'm okay! I'm very much okay! Son, you wanna talk about it? Lucky you for having a companion. Lucky you for having a partner. Would I ever be as lucky? Do you guys think I'll die alone? It's okay, cuz. There are lots of other fish. I'm sure you'll find the right fish for you. Agree. Being alone makes you crazy. [tense music plays] What's happening? It's Irene. Your Irene? -Irene-- -[shushes] -I think. -You think? [indistinct chatter] [gentle music playing] Irene! -[shushes] -[grunts] -[thuds] -[groans] How are you, Irene? Who are you? Do I know you? I have amnesia. I don't remember anything since my accident. Sorry if I don't remember you. -What did she say? -Bro? Why did she leave? Uh… -Soap opera? -She's just angry! That's what I said! -Maybe she has a boyfriend. -That's what I also said! What's the use of us talking if he's said everything already? -What if it's true? -Here, Daddy. Assuming it's true, do any of you know someone who's had amnesia? No, but that doesn't mean it doesn't happen! [Ken] "Amnesia… A severe blow to the head or from a traumatic experience." She could've bumped her head! Or gotten into an accident. Or got hit by a car. She doesn't look like she had an accident. She looked pretty. It might've been a while back. Maybe on the day of the wedding, after Apollo left Irene, she was so heartbroken, she got really upset, right? So she ran out of the church. She kept running and kept crying while the rain kept pouring. And as the rain poured, so did the tears from her eyes. And while the tears rolled down her cheeks, she slowly tripped until she broke her teeth as she hit the gutter. Then a truck passed… She wasn't hit because it was in the next street. But while she was on the ground, part of her brain fell out. -And that included her memory of Apollo. -[laughter] [bittersweet music playing] [rain pouring] It's raining! Irene! Irene! Cover your head! Hey, what's with you? Irene! It's raining, what's with you? -Come back here! -[sobbing] [bittersweet music continues] [car horns blaring] [car horn blaring] [tires screeching] -[thuds] -[shouts] [thuds] Oh, my god, Irene, you got into an accident? [music cuts off] Of course not. That's just my alibi in case I see him again. So you're expecting -to see him again? -[Irene] No. Just in case. It's better to be prepared. This is so complicated! You could've just said, "I hate you! You're evil!" -And not, "Who are you?" -You're right. What an excuse! I was caught off guard! I tried to forget the guy. He was like a zombie that just came back from the dead! Irene, you better be careful. You might end up really forgetting all the mistakes he made before. That definitely won't happen. So you're really pushing through with that? Yup! Hmm… -LET'S TAKE PICTURES -Come on, baby. -Let's go back? -No! -No? Just one more. -No. Be a good boy, just one more! One last. Look here, and one… [camera shutter clicks] [Irene] Beautiful! Okay, one more. -Last one. -Yes? -What can I do for you? -I'd like a picture -of my future child taken. -Oh, sir. That's great. Take a look at our packages. You might like one. I don't need discount packages, I'm rich. -Can she be the photographer? -[camera clicks] -Okay. -Miss, excuse me? Yes? Uh… [playful music] Sir? Uh… Um… I'll just come back when my wife is actually pregnant. I might be infertile. Thanks. -Here he comes. -Well? She does work there. And she didn't recognize me. Are you convinced? Let's go! Wait, what am I supposed to tell her? What do you mean? When have you ever lost your charm? This is different. This is Irene. Irene, who does not remember you. -Come on! -Come on! -Come on. -Faster. What if he's there? What's the problem with that? You already have your story set, right? -[door chime sounding] -Didn't you-- -Hi. -Sexy, hi! Mr. Infertile, you're back! -You guys, too? -No, just him. I'm Ken, by the way. Ouch! -Ouch. -[chuckling] You're funny! How can I help? We're friends of Irene. What do you need from her? We'd like our picture taken. -She's busy now-- -Irene's over here! Who are you? It's Irene! -[Peachy] They say you know them. -Who are they? Eric. -[Irene] Eric. -I'm Jan, from earlier. -I'm not infertile. -Jan. And I'm… Ouch! [chuckles] Ken. Ken. Um… Pol. Pol? You look familiar! Have we met? Grocery store! Right, at the grocery store! So, what brought you guys here? Have our pictures taken! [all chuckling] [Irene] Smile! And… [camera shutter clicks] You're all so cute! Guys, here's more! Is this yours? What's this? [Peachy] Mine and Irene's. Here you go. How long have you been doing this? -Around a year, right? -I need a hand. [Irene] Um… When did we last see each other? Uh… Around… two to three years ago. Right, Pol? [Apollo] More or less. I think. You have amnesia, too? [Irene chuckles] -Just kidding. -[laughter] [Irene] Smile! [camera shutter clicks] Wait. Could any of you be an ex of mine? Not me, I go for foreigners! I prefer someone a little taller. I used to be gay. Oh… Good. So I didn't upset any of you. At least we've made that clear. Smile. And… [camera shutter clicks] [Jan] Let's try to have solo shots. We'll begin according to name. That's you-- According to our favorite fruits. -Yours is apple! -Apple. [chuckling] Apple. I love apples. Okay, one, two, three! [camera shutter clicks] Ugly. Not you. The lighting. [Apollo] How have you been? Huh? I'm okay, why did you ask? Um… It's been a while since l saw you. [gentle piano music plays] It's as if nothing's changed. Really? What was l like before? Just like that. You're still cheerful. Kind. You're still beautiful. [camera shutter clicks] Wait, l have an idea. There! Fits perfectly! I'm glad I saw you again. Smile! [camera clicks] No good, lying snake! I can't believe he lied about being your ex! The nerve of that guy! [groans] But hats off to you for your acting! You really convinced him! I wonder why he's back. Because there's someone to come back to? Never. I've been fooled once. That's enough. What if he's persistent? What if he chases after you? Then let him. He'd never catch me. -Girl! -Oh, it died. Brilliant. Apollonio, just hear me out. If you're not sure about Irene, you better stop now! Just leave her alone! But, Pops, it was just himself that he was not sure about. Wait. Listen, Pol. This time around, are you sure about yourself? Not just that. -Are you ready to get hurt? -Why would he get hurt? Come on, bro, he knew a different Irene then. Surely, the Irene today is a lot different. Who's to say if the new Irene would still fall for Apollo? Of course she'd fall for him! That's my son! -Oh! -[laughter] Listen to Mr. Hitler. Okay, we're already at that point. What if she doesn't? What's the rush? Do you need to poop? -[chuckling] -There's the restroom. You all seem to be in a hurry. I haven't thought about any of that. All I know is that right now, l have a chance to make up for things. I'm not going to waste that chance. [gentle music plays] Shot! -Go for gold! -Go shot. -[laughter] -[Ken, clapping] Go, come on! Okay, okay. -[Irene] Come on! -[Peachy] Wait. Mister, door, please! Good morning, ladies. -Hi. -Let me. Mister? Ma'am, he said he will be your model. -Model. -Let me. -Here, let me. -Why did you come back? Something wrong with the pictures? No, I was just looking for you. Why were you looking for me? Why do we look for someone? Because you like them? No. Because she's lost. You look like you escaped from prison, so I looked for you. [fake laughter] [Irene] He's funny. Come with us. Come on! [fake laughter continues] -Let's go, mister! -[Irene] Come on, faster. [chuckles] -How did--? -[Apollo] Hi, again! [driver] That was quick, sir! And what are you doing here? l forgot to ask you if you'd like to grab a bite. We have a shoot today, right? -How about after? -This will take all day. Peachy and l are the only ones handling the shoot. [Peachy] Let's go. [Apollo] Then I can help! To make your job easier. [Peachy] Don't you have work? I don't. -[elevator dings] -You resigned? I just took a leave. You took a leave to grab some snacks? [chuckling] Yeah! -What floor? -12B. [elevator bell dings] [pleasant piano music playing] [indistinct chattering] [Peachy] Are we late? -You can put the stuff there. -Okay. [woman] So… it looks like the chase has started. Let's see. [playful music] [indistinct chattering continues] Give me your clothes. Um… Pol? I left the tripod in the van, can you get it for me? Okay. [playful music continues] [whooping] Noel! Pronto, unlock the door! What do you need, sir? [elevator bell dings] Thank you. Tripod! Just this? There are two in the van. Can you get the other one? Okay. [playful music continues] Noel! One more, open the door! Ah! Here! Thank you! Oh, wait! One more favor. Can you buy some body oil for the models? [chuckling] All right! Pay for it first, please! [giggling] [elevator bell dings] [elevator bell dings] Spritzer! [laughs] [elevator bell dings] -Text me, okay? -Okay. [elevator bell dings] [elevator bell dings] [yelps] [thuds] [music stops] -The lighting's better here. -Go back to the last one. -Irene. -How about this one, ma'am? Okay. -Floaters. -Thank you. This one is better. Burger. And fries! No, thanks. I don't eat that. Thank you! What else do you need? Stand there. I'll call you if I need anything. -[woman] l prefer this one. -Where were we? She said it's okay. [Irene] Um, Pol, can I ask you a favor? What is it? [Irene] Okay, girls, look here. Smile! Hold that! More wind, please! Wind! [blowing] [playful music] [Irene] Okay. Get down, Pol. Okay. Thank you, Pol! Smile! [shutter clicks] [Irene] Beautiful! Thank you, girls! Now, let's try the boys. Thank you, Pol! [Irene] Pol! Excuse me! We're short one model. Didn't you say that you're a model? -Help us out, please? -Model? That was a long time ago! Okay, girls, exit for a while. Be quick! Wait, what is this? Racquel, take charge, okay? -You know what to do. -[Racquel] Strip! -What do you mean, strip? -[Racquel] Strip. Irene said so. Oh. Okay. All right. [playful music] Irene? Hmm? Don't I look too hot in this? No, you look cute! Come here. You just need more body oil. Racquel, body oil! Come on. Okay. Just like that. You look nice. My hands have salt. Racquel, finish this. Faster. Catch it. Okay, everyone, clear the set, please? Come on, clear the set. Where's Pol? Come on, Pol. Center, please. Make way. Yes, center. Okay, look to the camera. We'll have a test shot. Pol, stomach in. Compress, everyone, test shot! -Okay, one-- -Hold it, Irene. ls this a joke? Huh? You'll ruin my calendar. I can't have this kind of body on my March page! Sorry. You're cute. But your stomach's too big. Well, Irene? Pol, can you step aside? The four will do. Okay, guys, compress and look here! This is a test shot. Okay, one… -Two-- -Winner. [gentle music playing] Can someone retouch the oil, guys? [playful music playing] What? [chuckles] [music fades] [pastor] "But if a wicked man turns away "from all the sins he has committed "and keeps all my decrees and does what is just and right, "he will surely live. He will not die." You think he's awake? -Probably! -At the back, please. [chuckles] How long do you intend on having amnesia? Until he disappears from my life! [phone ringing] -Wait. Hello? -[knocking] -Miss Marizel? -Good morning, ladies! Emergency? [Irene] Yes? You forgot something at the hotel last night. Really? What? Me. Oh… [chuckles] Sorry. Amnesia. So can we finally go out for a snack? Irene? What? Miss Marizel has an emergency. She's passing the shoot over to us! What about the debutante ball? We can handle it ourselves. It'll be extra cash. It's just a small family thing. Mister, the stuff. Wanna come? -Wanna come? -Sure. Wait. [woman] Get ready. Fix your makeup. We're about to start. Miss? Miss Irene? -Miss Irene Gallego? -Yes? We're Miss Marizel's clients. Oh… I was told it was a family portrait. Why are you dressed that way? It's our parents' golden anniversary. This is our gift to them. There they are. [melancholic music playing] Don't run, Nathan. Why didn't you tell me this was for a wedding? [Peachy] It's a photo shoot. l thought you were just allergic to wedding rites? -It's just the same. -Sorry, next time. -Where does this go? -Try it in the water. I'm kidding. Place it here. -Come here. -There? Where is our lovely couple? Position yourselves! Here, in front of me. You can remove the tripod. Yes, them first. -Here? -Lower, Pol. Lower. Look here. Smile! [camera shutter clicks] [melancholic music continues] -[woman] Can we see a kiss? -[man] One more, a sweeter one. One more? That's beautiful. Smile. [camera shutter clicks] [woman chuckles] They're so sweet! [chuckles] You're right. [birds chirping] Pol, move the reflector backward. Move it away, Pol. Farther. [woman] Dad, give Mom a hug! Farther. Farther. Huh? Farther! More, Pol. -Here? -Move away. Farther! -Farther! -Farther? Farther, Pol. Farther. Does this still have any effect? It still does! [man] Look at the camera. You're really making me cry! One more. Okay, look at the camera. Thanks for accommodating us despite the short notice. -It's not a problem. -We'll get you again next time. I'll recommend you someone else, she's much better than me. -Go ahead, you'll get wet. -Thank you! No. It's okay. That would've been a good gig. -Peachy can handle it. -[rain pouring] That's fine, leave it. -Let me. -I'll take care of it. -Let me. -Let me. I'll do it. Irene! The rain is starting to pour. Hey! Irene! Wait! It's pouring already. Stay in the hut. The camera's getting wet! [rain continues to pour] [rain pattering gently on roof] Hmpf! Here. I don't need it. Did I do something wrong? No. I was just reminded of a story my friend told me. [Irene chuckles] About what? I was supposed to get married before. [gentle music plays] But the guy left me at the altar. They didn't tell you who… that guy was? Beats me. No name? They didn't bother telling me. I might end up killing the guy. No pictures, nothing? None. They burned everything. So I wouldn't have to remember. Awful, right? What kind of person would do that? To think, he knew I had no family. That I prayed so long to find someone to be with forever. They said… I was so happy that day. It was a bright and sunny day. [bittersweet music rises] Everything was so magical. I was a glowing bride… [camera shutter clicks] to a perfect groom. In a perfect wedding. But I was wrong. After the guy ran off… they said I hid behind the altar. And that's where I kept crying and crying. Poch even tried to drag me out of the church. But I said… "No." They told me I said no. I wanted to stay there. To wait for him. I told them, "He'll be back. He can't do this to me." [rain continues to patter gently] [sniffles] [voice cracking] But I was wrong again. [crickets chirping] [bittersweet music plays] [rain pouring] It's raining! Irene! Cover your head! Hey! Irene! What's with you? [crying] [honking] [honking] [sobbing] [sobbing] Good thing l got into an accident. Imagine, despite having amnesia, it's still really painful. Let me ask you. Why? Why do you think he left me? You told me, I seem cheerful. You told me I'm beautiful. Kind. So why did he still leave me? [sobs] Maybe he was afraid. Bullshit! That's it? Maybe… he thought he was rushing into things. What a jerk! Then why did he bother proposing? I'm sure he had his reasons. Even I would be afraid. Of what? Of you. Of me? So it's my fault? No, he was afraid for you. That you would hurt more if he pushed through with it. That's bullshit! Does he think I'm not hurting now? Maybe he had a lot of questions then. What if everything would be about the two of you, that he would lose himself, that if he said yes then… what if he won't be able to commit to his promises? Did he find his answers? Huh? Did he? He realized it was harder for him after he lost you. Irene, I'm sure that wherever he is now, he regrets ever letting you go. That he hurt you. But… If he were standing in front of you, I'm sure that he would only ask you of one thing. That you forgive him. I'm sorry, I was too much of a coward. [gentle piano music playing] [heavy breathing] Irene. [choking] Here. [inhaling] [heavy breathing] [sobbing] [dramatic music plays] [crying] [crying] Serves him right! I'm sure his conscience is eating him up now! You were right to tell him how bad of a person he is. You should've rubbed it in more! He deserves it. When he said "sorry"? That he was a coward? You should've slapped him! Hey, Irene? I think you're the one who needs some slapping. Hey. I can see something in your eyes, Irene. Tell me! What's that l see? Look at me. What's that? -Well? -Anger! Wrong answer! What should I feel? You shouldn't be feeling anything! The fact that you're still angry means that there's still love in there! There's none. Hmm… -No more! -Okay. I said no more! No more. Life would be easier if we were just cars whose sins can be washed away. What's that? A manwash? [laughing] Hey, Apollo. It's not that. It's just different when you hear it straight from her. I used to think I was just a bad person. Now I feel like a monster. Take it easy, bro. You might self-destruct. That's why I don't want to fall in love. Of course true love is meant for the brave ones! Are you calling me a coward? -Yes! -Yes! [laughing] That's mean! Let me show you what true love is all about. Here. In three… two… one… two… three… -Right on cue! -Hi, honey! Right on cue. -Cheesecake! -Again? Isn't there anything else? Are you getting tired of this? Of course not, this is my favorite! -You should serve this at my wake! -There. -Sweet. -That's what you call brave! If only I can ease the pain I caused her with my embrace. I would have her in my arms until she heals. Careful, Pol, she might overdose! [laughing] I just want to see her smiling again. [gentle piano music plays] I just want to tell her… not to cry. That not everyone is like me. I want her to believe that someone has the capacity to love her, who will not leave her or betray her. Or ever make her cry. What if that's not you? Ouch. But, I can take care of myself. What's important is her. That she shouldn't close her doors on love. I love you, bro. You finally woke up. Breakfast? Sorry. Sure, later. Something is missing this morning. Looks like someone's given up. Good for him. [doorbell rings] Speaking of the devil! [door opens] Your bills keep ending up in my house. [camera clicks] -[Irene] Okay, thank you. You may change. -Thank you, too! Mrs. Rodriguez called to remind us not to be late for her child's party. -[Irene] Okay. -[door chime sounding] -Disappointed? -[door chime sounding] [gentle music plays] Coffee? He's still not showing up. You know, only two things can spoil a birthday. One, you end up being with the one you hate the most. Two, you don't get to be with the one you like the most. Drink up. Come on. Len, finish this for me. -We can't be late. -Okay. -[Len] Yes. -Come on! -Are we here? -Wow! This is it, ma'am. -Coral Tree Garden. -We'll handle this. Why are there two parties? -Must be a big celebration! -Which one? -It's a children's party! -Oh, yeah. Mrs. Rodriguez didn't mention it would be a children's party. -Said it was a birthday party. -Where's Mrs. Rodriguez? Looks like we're early! Surprise! [laughter] Hi! [gentle music plays] Hi. [Apollo] Hi, Irene. It's hard to ask you out for snacks. I had to leave you with no choice by booking your entire day. Let's go. Wait, I paid for this. You can't leave! And… they've been waiting for some time. And so have I. I didn't tell you to wait for me. Why does a person wait for someone? Because they escaped from prison. No. Because you like her. [chuckles] Irene, 27 years of your life were erased when that guy left you. I just want to bring back everything he took away. Such as? Hmm? Your smile. [Jen] Hi, Irene! There. I'm Mrs. Rodriguez. [gentle music continues] Happy first birthday, Irene! Really my first, huh? [blowing] -Happy birthday! -Hold this, let me clap. Happy birthday, Irene. Happy birthday! Hi, Irene! You can call me Daddy Diego. I'm Apollo's dad. Happy birthday! Thank you! [blowing] [Apollo] Pretend we have the power to time travel. We'll go back to your first year. We'll replace all the memories that you lost. From this moment on, all your memories are new, happy, -whole. -Happy birthday! [applause] -Beautiful! -Just relax, right, Peachy? What's going on? Are you ready? -[upbeat music playing] -[cheering] Wooh! Go! Go, boys! Go, Daddy! Wooh! That's great! Yes! Go! -Go, Daddy Diego! -You're doing great! Pol! [laughing] Go, Pol! Yes, here comes his wild side! [woman] Wow! Look at that! [laughing] Here we go. Ready? -Irene! -[camera shutter clicks] Wait there. Faster. Nice. Happy birthday again! [gentle music playing] [blowing] [Diego laughs] [camera shutter clicks] [blowing] Yay! -[laughing] -Yay! Happy birthday, Irene! This is so awesome! Are you ready for your next birthday celebration? [Irene] Huh? Yes! Just relax! Irene… -Where are you going? -Stay there! [music fades away] [crickets chirping] [gentle waltz music playing] [music stops] [tender music plays] Thank you. ♪ There you are again ♪ It's broken! I'm sorry. Hey. What now? -What's wrong? - ♪ There you are again ♪ He's nervous. It's okay. It's all right. Let's go? Go. Go ahead. ["Di Na Natuto" by Noel Cabangon playing] Close your eyes. Hmm? Just close your eyes. [song continues playing] They say… that with your eyes closed, you find out what you're really feeling deep inside. Irene, I wish that on this day… your heart would no longer be filled with pain and anger. I wish there would be happiness, too. …19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24… -Almost there! -…25, 26, 27, 28. [cheering] Happy birthday! -Okay. -Good morning! Coffee for you. Here's some coffee. And for my Irene, coffee and breakfast. All right, thanks. Thank you. Are you getting taller? Hmm? You used to reach my shoulder, but now you're up in my mind. [squealing] [door chimes] -[Peachy] Pretty girl, your ride's here. -Coming. -Thank you. -Let me. -Are you getting shorter? -No, why? You used to be up in my head. Now you're right in my heart. [chuckles] This is for you. Take it. [laughing] [door chimes] Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas! Twenty-three. Twenty-four. Twenty-five. Twenty-six. [Peachy] Twenty-seven. Pol, you lack one! I was hoping to be the 28th. This is it! [bright, tender music playing] Merry Christmas! I LOVE YOU BECAUSE… Here's one more. I don't think you'll be forgetting why he loves you! [giggles] Excuse me, sir, -this needs your signature. -[cell phone ringing] Hello? [Irene] Did you know you can be sued for trespassing? Because you keep breaking into my mind! [chuckles] You ought to buy some floaters, quick! Why, are we going swimming? No. Because you might drown in my overflowing love for you! l have some papers that need your signature. Huh? [pensive music plays] Your car might get towed! I don't care, as long as you won't be late. -Come on! -Let's go! [woman over PA] Smoking inside the station and the train is strictly prohibited. Thank you very much.

[chuckles] [exhales] [giggling] If I could do over just one thing in my life, it would be the day that I met you. I could go back countless times. Again and again. For the rest of my life. If you would let me. Will you marry me? [tender piano music plays] [cries softly] Wait. Will you? Mm-mm. Oh, okay. [Irene crying] [passengers cheering, applauding] [Irene crying] I need to tell him the truth! You shouldn't tell him you faked your amnesia! You're both happy now, right? What's the problem? Why ruin everything? So she's just going to keep pretending for the rest of her life? That would be unfair. Unfair? But of course! Hello, the poor guy is just going to look stupid forever! So what? At least she's happy! [scoffs] I know. [upbeat music plays] What are you thinking now? I need to have another accident. I'll bump my head, I can tell him my memory came back. He will never know I've been lying to him! -How will that be? -Huh? I will fake an accident. -What? -Say that again? I will fake an accident! She lost her mind! And what accident would be convincing enough for Apollo? I'll bring him to the gym. [panting] Am I doing this right? Pol! [grunting] Apollo? Who are you? Apollo? Who are you? -That's bad. -That's bad. It is. What if I do it this way? [playful music] Pol, the cat! [tires screeching] -Where? -[horn honking] Apollo? It would be a lot simpler to just tell him the truth. This is it! I'm telling her the truth! Hallelujah! My son finally got it right! -Your drinks are on me. -There you go! -And there's more! -That's a first! With free appetizers, too! Wait, did I hear it right? You're admitting the truth? Ken, I love Irene. If we're getting married, I don't want us hiding anything from each other. She has to know that I'm Apollo. But what if this happens? What if she says, "I don't want you anymore! I'm upset! The wedding's off!" What if she says, "I forgive you, Apollo!" [Apollo chuckles] What we mean to say is… You have to be sure about what you want to do. You've been given a second chance, but what if a third won't come? [fake crying] -What? -Because of that… I don't wanna cry. -That's your last! -[laughter] What if she comes to her senses? Wait a minute. Just sit down! Seriously, all I'm saying is, if she is to know the truth, she'll probably be upset about me lying to her. Right, Pops? But if you love a person, you must stand by your actions. -That's right! -Expert! I just learned my lesson. Are you feeling cold? Hmm? No. I'm okay. It's your hands that are cold. Might've been the glass of juice I was holding earlier. Pol, where are we going? Surprise! Pol, I wish I could get my memory back. Pol, watch out for the cat! [tires screeching] [coughs] [playful music plays] You okay? Huh? -Did that hurt? -No, I'm all right. We're here. [dramatic music playing] What's this? We're time traveling. Remember I said that if I were to return to a moment in my life, it would be the time that I met you? Wear this. Irene, this is where we first met. You were an event photographer. You stood there. And I stood here. That's where I first saw you. I even said, "Not too shabby!" [delicate music playing] Then I winked at you, just like this. Your friend went up to you and placed something by your chest. That's when I found out you were an organizer. [Apollo's friends] Not possible! But I said, "It's all right." [buzzer rings] The entire night I kept glancing at you. You kept going around. You kept going around because you kept taking pictures. Finally, Jan arrived. I asked him to take my place. So that I could approach you. This was where you stood. And I came from here. l went up to you. And I said… "Hi. I'm Apollo." But you said, "I'm not part of this." I said, "It's all right. I just want to know if you believe in love at first sight?" You said no. So l left. But I came back. And I said, "What about second sight?" Then you smiled like that. [sobbing] Then you said, "I knew it. I'm a camera. Because I can make you smile." So I said, "You might not get home tonight. Because you're already in my mind." Then you said, "You're like lice. Already in my head." Then I said no. You remember now? I never forgot anything, Apollo. I didn't get into an accident. I don't have amnesia. Apollo, I never forgot about you, ever. I'm sorry. I just got scared. I got scared of losing you. I'm sorry. [sobbing] [dramatic music swells] Amnesia, eh? I can't believe we were so stupid to fall for that. We really fooled ourselves. This is your fault. Mine? Amnesia. Who are you? Who bought the television? Did I just throw a punch? [voice breaking] That hurt. I didn't see it coming. I would've expected… [sniffles] A slap, a punch, a lot of anger. Not that. [sniffles, exhales] I know I have no right to be angry. I was the first to hurt her. I get that. But… This really shoots through the heart. Woo! [exhales loudly] It's so sad. It's just so sad that we ended up this way. [sniffles] Dude. Stop crying. Men don't shed tears. [Apollo's father] Hey. Leave him to shed his tears. That's a good remedy for sore eyes. His heart has sore eyes. But once the bruises heal and the dirt clears up, -he will know the answer. -The answer to what? The answer to why he returned to Irene, and why he will let her go again. Right? The census says… that at least 11 million people live in Metro Manila. With all these people, how would you be able to tell who is the one for you? Are you okay? Yup. What if you passed him, but you didn't notice? [Apollo] When she walked by, you might have been busy tying your shoelaces. He might have stood beside you when you checked the traffic light. You might have seen her in front of you, had it not been for the pedicab. With all these people, some have been lucky to find the one, some are still searching. Others have given up. But the worst of all is if you already found the one but you let them go. But, sir, how could you be sure that was your true love, if you let them go? Huh? Did you try searching for others? What? Or would you just consider her your true love for sentimental reasons? Because she'll never come back. No. She came back. I had her back. We had a second chance. [gentle music plays] Yeah. I had a second chance. And I loved her even more. Sir, you're so lucky! [whispers] Yeah. [door chimes] They just left. It isn't him. [groans] I can't take this anymore! I'm going crazy! -Where are you going? -To apologize to Apollo! -He might be mad! -It's okay! -If he ignores you? -It's fine! -If he slaps you? -My cheeks can handle it! -If he doesn't accept it? -I don't care. I just want to tell him how sorry I am. I just want to talk to him. I just want to tell him how much I still love him. [cell phone ringing] Apollo? Where are you? On my way to you. You're on your way to me? Why would a person make an effort to see someone? Because you like them? No. Because you love him. [sobs] I'm sorry, Apollo. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [shushes] -Irene, I love you. -I love you. [chuckles] -I love you, too. -I love you, too. Uhm… Just stay there. I'll go to you. Okay? Just stay there. [sobbing] I'll stay here. Yes, I'll stay right here. I really, really, really, really, really love you. Don't ever forget that. We'll start over. [exhales] [romantic music swells] [horn honking] [tires screeching] [grunts] [honking] [groans] [music turns dark] [woman speaking indistinctly over PA] Who are you? I've already used that trick. Who are you guys? [doctor] Apollo is experiencing traumatic amnesia. This happens when the head suffers from physical injury. I'm afraid the medial temporal lobe in his brain was affected. It may be temporary, but… we'll never know until we run some tests. Hopefully, we can help him recover not just physically, but also emotionally. He should be given as much love as he can get for a quicker recovery, and the possibility of regaining his memory. I'm your most handsome cousin-- It hurts. I'm Ken, your cousin. The most handsome. Apollo, my name is Jen, Jan's wife. I'm Jan. Your father. [laughter] You're confusing him! Seriously, I'm Jan. -Your mother. -[laughter] Poodle. One more! Fortune cookie. -[laughter] -[man] One more. Candy. [playful music] [Jan] You know, my dear, amnesia is all in the brain. When banged hard, it can cause memory loss. But I believe in the power of the heart's memory. When the heart loves, despite how much trauma it goes through, it never forgets. Check this out. Irene and Apollo. Yihee! I'll make one more. -Really? -Here. A bird with no wings. Enough, enough! It's your turn. You might get tired walking around. Let's start from the beginning. A review. Who am I again? You're my Irene. My fiancée. You're a photographer. -Eeh! No! -What? -I'm a policewoman. -A policewoman? Because you are my most wanted. [chuckles] And you are a can of paint. Because… You brought color to my world. Or a dictionary. Because… you give meaning to my life. Wait. Whoo! What is this? Dental floss. You see… when you were young, you'd often get a scolding from your mom because you were so forgetful. Wear this so that you will never forget that from this day onwards, I will be the one to take care of you. It's my turn. And even if your memories never come back, we'll make a whole lot of new ones. Happy ones. I will never leave you, Apollo. Do you believe in love at first sight? Yes! Sorry! And second sight, third sight! Fourth! Fifth! Sixth! Seventh! Eighth! It doesn't matter how many sights! -Are you an alarm clock? -Why? Because you woke my sleeping heart. Are your eyes filled with poison? Because you've got killer looks. [giggles] Wait. If you were a cactus, I wouldn't mind getting hurt as long as I'm in your embrace. You're hurting me! Wait. What's your blood type again? Type A, you? You're my type. I love you. I wish you were a pirated CD. So that I could hear that over and over again. I love you. I love you. I love you. I really just love you. [jazzy romantic music playing] [Apollo] Your clothes fit you well. But I'm a better fit for you. [Irene] Ooh. Are you asthma? Because you take my breath away. [Apollo panting] [Apollo] Where were you last night? [Irene] I was just here. Why? [Apollo] No wonder you weren't in my dreams. [Irene] Hmm. [chuckles] If you were rain, I'd be the ground. Whether you like it or not, you'd land on me. [both giggling] -[Apollo] Maybe you are the storm. -Why? You have such a strong effect on me. [Irene] Hold on. Is there a traffic enforcer here? Why? Because our hearts just crashed into each other! [Apollo] Oh, yeah! -[Apollo] They're staring at us! -[Irene] Let them! -[Apollo] They're just envious. -[Irene] You're right. [Apollo] Just wave at them. [Irene] I don't want to. Don't lie there. -[Apollo] There's your doctor. -[Irene] Bye, doc. -Bye, doc. -Bye. [Apollo] Would you like to run for office? [Irene] Why? [Apollo] My dad's rooting for you. Oh! -[Irene] Are you ice? -[Apollo] Am l? -[Irene] No. Are you ice? -[Apollo] What? Spell it. [Irene] Ice! Well, are you ice? -[Apollo] Why? -[Irene] I want to crush on you. [chuckling] -[Apollo] Are you wine? -[Irene] Why? [Apollo] Because you make me tipsy! [Irene] You know… You must be the electric company. Because you bring light into my life! -You know that. -[Apollo] Really? Can I reach you? [Irene] Mh? [Apollo] Because you're my dream. [Irene] Is there a ghost? Why don't you just sell your house? [Apollo] Why would I do that? -Because you're free to live in my heart! [both chuckling] [Apollo] If you want, you could be my driver. -[Irene] Why? -[Apollo] So that you can run my life. [Irene] Ah! So you want a vehicle? Why don't you just be my magic carpet? -[Apollo] Why? -'Cause you took me to a whole new world! [laughing] [Irene] That's too much but you handled it well. -I'm impressed. -[Apollo] I have a question. Where do you want to get married? I'd want it right next to you. [Irene] Aww. [Irene] You know, you're like a soap opera. [Apollo] Me? [Irene] Because you're so addicting! [Apollo] And you would be a movie. -[Irene] Huh? -[Apollo] It feels good just watching you. [both laughing]
