DENIS ALLEN JAMES Mr. Denis how many were wounded in this fire? Five dead, twenty eight wounded The five dead are four men and one woman Mr. Denis, does the police suspect that the Rolls Royce Music Parlour is a cse of arson? According to the evidence found at the scene eye-witnesses saw a man whose legs were on fire jump down from the stairs when the fire started Therefore we initially think that this is more likely an arson case Our investigation team is now handling this case We hope that the public could help provide us with the following information First of all, on February 19th if someone was seen with burns on his hands and legs or who has any leads about this man please let us know Second, on February 19th anyone who threw away burnt clothing or anyone related to this please let us know Thirdly, would all medical centres kindly provide information on the man who has been treated with burns Fourth, on the night of February 18 or morning of 19th if anyone's seen with this kind of carton for gasoline or any related persons or anyone from a gas station, repair shop particularly in the Mongkok area who has sold this kind of gasoline or if you discovered that about 2 gallons of gasoline in your car had been stolen during the above mentioned period please contact us immediately I have a question Go ahead Mr. Denis It was rumored that a man's leg was found at the scene Does this mean that this is not only an arson case but also a murder case?
