- Rage. I call it that for a reason. After 12 years of schooldesks and uniforms, you open the gates and the animals run out. They're all here. The foxes. The zebras. The lions. - I laugh in the face of danger. - Kyle's dad is CEO of some multinational farmer company. Trust One vibes. And while daddy is skiing in Italy, we stole the keys to his beach house. Sihle got thrown out of physics in March. Never went back. Still finished top of the class with a bursary to study biochemistry. The only thing more pathetic than a fuckboy? A wannabe fuckboy. Leon. - So, um, are your parents terrorists? - That's wildly offensive. - No, 'cause, 'cause they made a bomb. Um... - He's gonna do some hardcore engineering shit and Elon Musk his way to Mars. Tamsyn posts like five times a day. Hashtag art, hashtag beautiful. She dreams of New York and Paris, but we all know she's from the ghetto. Neo is all about the self-improvement, emphasis on self. He's gonna study law and sue himself rich. Me? Yeah, that's me. I'm all about the gap year and the backpackers and carpe-ing the fucking diem. I've been a good girl all my life. Maybe it's time to be bad. - You're perfect. Like even the way you're ignoring me now, it's... Tamsyn. Tamsyn, it's okay. - I'm calling the fucking cops. - Neo, I was trying to save her. She fucking turned into something. - Something? - I don't know, I don't know. It wasn't her. - What did she drink? - Ooh. Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit. - Okay... Where? - Get their stomachs pumped? - No, just glucose and vitamin C. Give them some of the pancakes. - Oh, guys. Are you okay? What happened? - Oh my god, Tamsyn. - What up? We were on fire in there. - Please don't talk like that. - Guys. - Come on, man, what? What happened to him? - Leon? - You look drunk. - I'll take those. Where you guys staying? - Hey. What's up? - Safe! - Jesus. - Listen, if you guys ever need to talk or maybe we can help you clean up a purchase, give us a call, okay, - Do you want to come in? - You guys have to leave this place. - Okay. Good talk. - Blessings, guys. - Blessings, y'all - Actually gotta keep your weight up. There you are. Where you going? - Swimming. - Come! - I'm thirsty. Yeah, they're partying again. I don't get it. What's the big secret, anyways? - Well Henkels are supposed to be responsible, you know. - To think. I've abdicated my crown for you, a commoner. - Do the speech. - Oh. Oh my god. And so my fellow matrics, I say to you, with apologies to Alexander Pope, with too much quickness ever to be taught. With too much thinking to have common thought, may we purchase joy with all that pain can give and die of nothing but a rage to live. - Yes. - Bullseye. Yeah. - Nice, girl. - Yes. - Oh, nice, nice, nice. Thanks, girl. - You're welcome. - Thanks. - I can't move. - Morning. - Oh, you give me life. - Just what the fuck happened last night? - It was, it was like another dimension. - A dimension of dicks? - Hey? - I literally died. - Oh my God. What did you take? - Yeah. - Nothing. - There were millions of butterflies. It's like I was born again. - Oh honey, you don't get that from two vodka tonics. Somebody spiked your drinks. - Well, I'm not going back to get roofied. - Hells no guys, we stay here tonight. - That means shopping for actual food. - Oh my gosh, guys, there was this really cute shop up the road, like all old school farm stall kind of thing. - Okay, Leon, let's go to the cutest little shop. - Oh my gosh. What is this place? - I know. - I see you're a servant of the phallic gods. - I'm sorry? Guys, no, man. - There's nothing fresher? - We don't get customs this time of the year. Sorry. - Yeah, it's like a ghost town. - Are you here for the rage? - I hope we're not disturbing you. - Oh no. We welcome fresh blood. - What's that? - Niggerballs, you want? - I'm sorry, what did- - We'd just like some vegetables, maybe some quinoa. - Boetie went to town this morning. Perhaps he'll- - Just maybe butternut? - Can we just talk about what just- - How old is she? - Is this what your dad and his PA get up to here? - No, no, that, that came with the house. Yeah, some artist chick who ended up joining this hippie commune out here. You know, Charles Manson vibes and suicide cults and all that shit. Whatever. What's it worth? - A ton. If you believe the old man. And where do you think you're going? - Would you look at that? It's time to grow up. Come on. - You see the bathroom is down the passage. - So what's over there? - Dad's office. Trespassers will be shot. - Ooh. Okay. Thanks. - Rox. You all right in there? - I'm fine. - Should I come in? - No, Kyle, just... Fuck, wait there. Jesus. No, no, no, no, come on. Fuck. Shit. - Oh fuck, Roxy. Geez. - Rox? Are you okay? Oh, shit. Shit. Shit, shit. - I know, I'm sorry. - Oh god. It's the mothership. Hello mummy. - "Hello mummy." - Just board games and stuff. - Oh yes, oh. - Kyle. - Leon. - Yo. Yo, mister hovering ominously on the edge of the property. Can we help you? - I'm here for the toilet. - I cannot. - Take me to your toilet. - It's this way. I'll show you. - Roxy. - Hey, what are you looking at? - This was my Opa's house. - Oh, why did he sell it? I mean, it's so beautiful. - He didn't. He died. He hung himself from that balcony. - Neo. Sorry. - It's okay. Dead peoples don't care. - Oh, so why didn't you live in it then? - We lost it. 'Cause of the bank. This house has a septic tank. Aye you, you girlies been throwing all of your whatchamacallit toilet in the toilet? - Excuse me? - Bit of a heavy flow. - Oh my God. - Whoa, that's- - Better than a rage baby, aye? - That's not cool, bro. - We know what this week is about. - Are you coming? - Yeah. Sorry. - Guys. He was there last night. - Oh, that's impossible. I thought it was a private party. No cavemen allowed. - You know, there are not so many young people in the area. Anyway, I'm not, you know, a cool guy. - No, nonsense. You should come have a drink with us sometime. - You really, you don't mean that. - No. No, I mean, of course I do. Mm. - Is it. - Fuck it. - Two, guys, I swear. Is that like guys or girls or? - Uh, you know I love my licorice all sorts. - Mm, and Tamsyn? - Uh-uh. - Can I guess? I'll guess. Four. - Have you been reading my diary? - Whore. - What the fuck did you just say? - It's something in my throat. - Fuck off with that slut shaming. - What? I'm just joking, man. You know, I love a woman with experience. - What's yours? - That's classified. - Mm, he wants us to think that it's loads. - The confidence of a mediocre white man. - Meantime, he's sitting with his little dick in his hand every night. - Fuck you. - Uh uh, no, I do not even want to hear it. - Number one, it was a dark and stormy night and I met this very handsome stranger. - Ah-ah, no, please. - I remember him. - Leon, what about you? - Um... Five. - And what were their names? - Um, so, Melanie, Victoria. Then Jerry, Emma. - You're literally naming the Spice Girls. - No guys, come on. Guys. Stop it. Ignore him. Come here. It's beautiful, okay? - Aye, fuck off. Guys, it was five. Come on. - Hey, hey! Sorry I'm late. You wouldn't believe my mum. Yeah, and she makes me so mad. Hey, brewski? - Brewski? - Brewski. - And you invited him? - I didn't think he'd come, okay? - What, do you want a rage baby? - You know what this actually is? It's racism. - Ah, it's not racism if the guy's a fucking ax murderer. - Oh my god. - You know who dies first? The Black guy. You know who dies second? The gay guy. - You're being ridiculous. - And the virgin survives. Thanks, Rox. - He can't keep ruining our vibe, man. Seriously, what a dumbass. - I'll make for you a nice fire, aye? - What is this music? - Um, not sure. It's Spotify. - Spotify? You must get for me that CD, eh? - Fuck. - I'm a person of the peoples. Some drying, some talking. But my mum- - Oh my god. Oh my god, oh my god. - What? - There's some weird shit going on over. There's some fucking exorcist Halloween witchcraft voodoo... - That sounds dope, let's go. - What? No. - Just come here, come here. Take it easy, take it easy. Hey, you're through the looking glass now. - Okay guys, I think it's time we take this party home, eh? - Uh, don't be salty. - Where's Leon? - And I thought I was gonna fail that test. Aye, Salinger, oh? Ooh. Good call on this one, aye? - Oh, for fuck's sakes, Neo. Oh, ooh. - Bruh. Madame. - Don't mind if I do. Ooh. Can I interest you in some methylenedioxymethamphetamine? - MDMA. It's pure ecstasy. - You should have a drug for every emotion. Like, I just took a tab of jealousy. - Rage! - I'll chug it. - Down it, down it. - Down it, down it, down it. - Kyle, stop it. - Yes, man! - What's wrong with you, man? - I'm leaving. Leon, walk with me? - Be right back. Roxy? - Yeah? - I love you. I love you. - I just love you guys so much. I mean really. I mean, we just meet you, but I can sense that you're good. - What are you doing? Did you just touch my boob? - What the fuck, man? - I'm sorry, I- - Are you fucking insane? - I'm sorry. - Ah, fuck off, man. Go fuck off back to your own people, pervert. - I'm sorry. - No, girls, we're leaving. - Tell them, friend. - Uh huh, tell them nothing. Fuck you. - I'm sorry- - And don't try that shit again, man. Fuck you. - Okay. - Fuck. Roxy. Roxy, stop! Come on, Roxy. Come on Rox, it's nothing, man. It was nothing. Shit. - Oh, shit. - Roxy, it wasn't me. It was Molly. Who the fuck are you? Shit, oh shit. - Are you okay, girly? - Oh my god. You gave me a fright. - Don't be afraid. We always keep an eye out. What's wrong? - I think... I think I, I saw something. - Oh. Are you alone? Where are your friends? - They're not, they're not my friends. - Honesty. It's the most important thing. They are not honest people. - I'm really sorry if they offended you earlier. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Everything can be made right. - Wait, what? What do you mean we? You said that we always keep an eye out here. What? - Oh. My family, this place. You know, it was our farm. Nothing bad must happen here. - Oh, shit. - The struggle is real. - Kyle said the reception is pretty shit here. - Guys. Guys, it's real. It's real. What I saw last night, it's real. - And a lot of blood and a, and a dead baby's feet. - What? - We have to report this. Call the police. - Kyle! - Where is he? - And Roxy. - They ran out last night. Guys, did you know that- - That they were a thing? Yeah. - How? - Uh, my sixth sense. The way she looked at him. - It's not your fault, Tam. - Nothing? - It's not supposed to look like this, right? - No, it's not. 13, please. No, 13, a spanner. It's the shiny thing with the round top that says 13. - Oh. Is it gonna work? - I'm gonna try sprawling it. - I just wanna say that I think it's, like, amaze-balls that you can do this. And if I'm in a sitch on a dark night, I know who I'm gonna call. - Cable tie. Fuck. Cable tie. The plastic thing with the little head that looks like a ladder. Neo? Geez, man, Neo? Neo! Guys. Neo's gone. - What do you mean gone? - I don't know. Fucking taken, I don't know. - Taken? Pick a weapon. Something you can swing. You don't wanna get too close. - Can we talk about how you went from zero to GJ Jane in like five seconds? - Guys? - What? - Here's one. - Fuck. - Guys. - What? Oh. Shit. Guys, wait, wait, stop. It's a trap. I'm not saying we should stop all I'm saying is- - This could get us killed. - And we're not killers. - We don't know that that's what- - Tamsyn. I think we know. - We have to go. Go. Go. - I've got some money, man. Whatever you need to not do this. - We're getting you ready. - For? - What is this? NPF and DayGlo shit? - This is it. This is what I saw, on the beach. - Looks like a Namlanga. - Which is? - An artist. She painted these rituals, like Goya, in Africa. And then she joined some hippie cult and started calling herself the Pride of the Sun. Never seen one like this before though. - That's a sunstone. Didn't the pagans use to mark the seasons or something? - Yeah. During their fertility rituals they ask the gods for healthy children and good crop. - Like you just ask God, he's like, "Sure bro, why don't you just say so?" And then it's, like, boom. Good crops. - It's not that simple. They usually have a sacrifice. - What, like a lamb or a pigeon or something? - No, the virgin sacrifice. - Thank God we're safe. - Are we? - It's just a painting. - Roxy. - Roxy. - Where were you? - Leon. - Hm? - Oh my god. Fuck. - We need to get you to a hospital. - Speak to me, my darling. How you feeling? Rox, use words. - Look, can you tell us what happened to you? Where's Kyle? - Time's nothing but a rage 'til death. - Oh my god, guys. - What? - The wound. It's drilled. - Guys, this is fucking insane. How is she alive? - Here, just rest now babe, okay? Just rest. - What are you doing? - The next town is 25 Ks out. If I leave now I can make it before dark. You can't go out there, Tamsyn. - I'm not asking you to come with me. Stay inside and stay quiet. I'll bring the calvary. And the medics. Leon, help me. That's my sign, don't open for anyone else. - We'll set up camp in the living area. Sleep there, eat there, everything there. - All right, what do we do with Roxy? - Unless you wanna dabble in neurosurgery, just keep her still. - We have to prepare for a long night. Stop them from coming inside. - They've already been inside. - Fuck. - We locked it from the inside. - Exactly. - Do you think this means that... - She let herself out. - Hot, aye? You want a lift? - No, I uh... - Look... I'm sorry about... - My friends, they overreacted. I wouldn't mind making it up to you. Kneel. Get down. Get down! - Okay. Where are the fucking keys? - This old girl works a bit different. First you have to warm her up a bit and then I have to connect the wires. No hard feelings, huh? - Get off me! - Hey. - No, please. - What do you think of me, huh? I'm a cheap woman? Hands. Hands. You know what they say? If your eye bothers you, rip it out. If your hand bothers you, cut it off. - Please. - I'm a believer of choice. Left, right? Or center, hm? - Left, right or center? - I'm not playing your fucking game. - Okay, center then. - No! - Left, right or center? - Help me! Somebody help me please! - Now you see, that's why I like it here. It's nice and quiet. - Left. Just do it. - May I interest you in the Mediterranean platter, madam? - Right now, I could eat a dead horse. - As opposed to a living one, sure. - When we get outta here, I owe you dinner. Some fancy le jeu de jous shit. - Maybe it's Tamsyn. - Obviously not. - Help me, help me. - Okay, okay, okay. Are you ready for this? Do you understand what I mean? - Yes. - Okay. Let's go. Oh, fuck. Shit. Oh my god. Okay, okay. Let's just- - Shh. I think they'd hear us. - What's going on, Leon? Leon. Leon. - It's gone. - Thank you for doing that. I don't think I could have. - Guess there's a first time for everything. - Guys, please open. - Tamsyn? - Open up. - Do your knock. - I can't, please just open. - Why not? - I can't. Open it please. - Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. - My hand. - Okay. Okay. Shh. Okay, gimme a second. Let me check. Okay. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Okay. I'm sorry. - They're watching us, right now. They talked about a ceremony at dawn and how flowers need to be harvested. - Flowers? - She means us. She means this. - Can you bring it closer? - Got it? - Yes. - What's that? - Put it down. - Okay. - Guys. - Bitch. What the fuck? Welcome to the museum of fucked up shit. - Sihle? - Hm? - This is a simple molecule. Two methyl groups, nitrogen, hydrogen. This is DMT. - That Ayahuasca stuff. - You get it in plants, right? - It's all over. Nobody knows why it even exists and the brain produces it in the penial gland in tiny dosages, except for when you're born and die, then in floods. - That's why they call it the spirit molecule. - They say it feels like heaven and death. - So that's what they were doing. - They were testing. - And now they're harvesting. I can't believe this is happening and we're just waiting. - What do you want? Immunity? At least you got your wild orgy with the Spice Girls, right? - Sure. It was such a crazy night. - Actually, we kind of thought that you were playing for the other team. - Yeah, I'm still figuring it out myself. - We all are. - Actually, I kind of thought the same thing about you. - Oh, what? - Yeah, that you were into girls. - I'm not into a gender. I'm into people. Come on. It's just me and you, okay? - Okay. - Let's save you, Leon. - Better tell those fuckers about this. - Yeah, I'll just make it my status. - Thank you. - It wasn't a favor. I would've wanted this anyway. - Me too. - It's happening again. They drugged us. They put it in the food, in the booze. I don't know. The water, obviously. Okay, sit down. Sit down. Bunker down and ride it out. - Guys, guys, they know where we are. We can't sit you and wait to be killed off one by one. - No, we should all go out and get killed off all at once. - Honestly, that kind of sounds better right now. - No. - Yes! Okay. - Do you think they're watching us now? - Stop it. - We've gotta get out of here. - Just remember it's all in your mind. - I know you think you're our leader but we didn't vote for you. - Leader? - I... - I wasn't talking to you. We've gotta get out of here. - Me too. I have to go. The house is on fire. - It's really not, though. Guys. - I walk. - None of this is real. Is this real? - That's pretty fucking real. - This is so beautiful. Go inside. - Fuck we will. - We want the flowers, not the bee. - I can see the final thought. - No. Leon. Leon? No. - I will see you on the other side. Yes, yes, yes. Please. Okay? Okay. - Give it back. - No. You gifted this to me. Hello. I just got here. - Okay. Okay. - Gotta suck the matter out of life, aye? Uh uh. - Tamsyn? - Yeah? - I'm freaking the fuck out. - Me too, friend. Me too. - It's like this is not my body. - I'm here. - I'm here. - This is real. - This is real. - This is how we'll get through this. - Keep talking, please. - I started it all. - No. - They were waiting for us, looking at us. We never stood a chance. I still feel like if Colin and I- - You ever heard of survivor's guilt? Like you feel guilty because the others were so unlucky? You feel like you should have been dead. But it's all just random. All just a throw of a dice. - Yes. - Like if you didn't sit next to me in the first day of grade eight, we wouldn't be here. But you did. And I'm glad that you did because we had a time. - You had those ugly braces. - The ones with the colored elastics, yeah. Those were super cool when I was 13. - You were super cool. Thank you for always letting me copy your homework. - What were you gonna do with the inner structure of the mitochondria, anyway? - Did you hear that? - Probably not, but I can feel you. - That's enough. Sihle? - Shh, shh. You know what they say. The youth is wasted on the young. - Sihle. - Would have been nice. - Boetie! - Roxy, help me, please. Roxy. - You purchase the pain with all that joy can give and die of nothing but rage to live. - Please!
