Tanya, you wouldn't believe the dream I- Tanya? W- What's going on? Mama? Papa! What's- What's happening? Mama, help! Ohh! Oh, my God! Shhh, Fievel. Mama's here. Shhh. Wha- W-W-What happened? Fievel had another nightmare. I didn't mean to. Of course not, Bubeleh. That's okay. Everyone is scared. Sure! All those homes smashed. Mice snatched from their beds. Horrible stories of huge teeth... and slashing claws! Papa, enough already. What? I'm just discussing. Fievel, it's very late. Try to sleep, okay? Try to sleep. Sleep, sleep, sleep- Holy Swiss cheese! I'm gonna be late for work! Uhh! Oh, no. The sun isn't even, uh- - Oh. - Oh, I can't believe I overslept! This is awful! Just awful! You want to talk awful? Oy, look at this headline. "Manhattan Monster Mystery Torments Midtown Mice." My boss, Mr. Daley, came up with that. I think it's catchy. And I think it's cockamamy. He should be ashamed printing such stories. It's a wonder any of us can sleep. But, Mama, Mr. Daley says that's what sells newspapers. Only Nellie Brie says that all the rumors about a monster... are just a bunch of babble and balderdash. They argue all the time. You actually met Nellie Brie? Sure! First day I'm on the job, she walks up, shakes my paw... and says, "Welcome to the Daily Nibbler." Say, when you see her, tell her that was some article she wrote about those mice... slaving away at the clothing factory. So, what kind of a story is that? Everybody we know works hard! No, Mama. This was different. This was criminal. Mice working days at a time. No air. No food. No water. No nothing! Whoo! You bet, "whoo." So Nellie Brie goes to work there undercover and in disguise too. She exposes the whole thing in the newspaper, and all the rats who own the place, they go to jail. Wow. She must be really brave. Yes. I suppose so. Good! Then I want you should take Fievel to work with you. - Huh? - And have this maven, Nellie Brie, tell him that this monster is a bunch of "bubel" and "bolderdip." You mean "babble" and "balderdash." "Buble," "bauble"- whatever. Fievel, go get dressed. Okay, Mama. No, Mama. Please. I can't! T- Tell her, Papa! Mama, she is new on the job. Yes. But how did you get this job? Well, through Tony. But-But- And whose friend is Tony? Fievel's. - So, it's settled. - I'm ready. I'm doomed. Julius! Julius! Quiet, please. Quiet. Your attention- I have an announcement. My fellow rodents, rest assured that the council and I will get to the bottom of this crisis. Rest assured? Ha! We can't sleep in our own beds... for fear of some ravenous hobgoblin popping up through the floorboards! He's right. That wall they built maybe stopped the cats, but it didn't stop that monster! I think we better off before, huh? Tanya, slow down, will you? Now, just remember when we get to the newspaper, don't be a pest. I am not a pest! And don't even try to talk to my boss, Mr. Daley. Understand? Why? Is he mean? Mean? Oh, no! He's wonderful. - He's the kindest, smartest- - So, you like him? Like him? No. I didn't say that! What do you mean? I'm just saying he's- He's busy. Huh? Next. - State your destination. - I'm going to my job at the Daily Nibbler. A- A-And I'm with her. Hmmm. Huh? Hmmm. Huh? Huh. Heh? Very well. Pursuant to United Rodent's Council Resolution four, dash-three, dash-seven. I hereby inform you that we are in a state of emergency... due to recent attacks by an animal or animals unknown. For your own safety, stay on the main streets, stay in plain sight. Return through the gate before dark. Any questions? Be careful out there. Hey! Good morning, sir. You? Get your paper! New York World! Two cents. Get your paper! Right here! There you go. A'right! Sir. New York World, right here! Extra! Extra! Read all about it! Street- This stop 54th! 54th Street. Watch your step. Careful. Careful, dear. That's the last one! All right, now. Be careful. Of what? That. Okay, men. Load up the carts. Head for that table. Whoo. Whoo-haaa! Ooh-woo! Ah. Fievel, behind you! Hey! Yeow! Oh, honestly. Is this your idea of being careful? Now, hold on tight. Well, hello, Tanya. Nellie. Thanks. That was really- - Why are you dressed like that? - Oh, ha. Well, you see, I'm writing an article about the security gate, looking for signs of blackmail and kickbacks. Things of that sort. Ha! Couldn't find a stitch of it. Excuse me. You're- She's- Nellie Brie? That's my byline. - And you are? - Uhhh- Oh, Fievel Mousekewitz, ma'am. Delighted. Well, better be on my way. If I'm late, Reed will bluster on about it all morning. And we wouldn't want to give him the satisfaction, now would we? Wow! You wanna talk with her or not? Here you go, miss. All aboard. Thank you. Come on, Fievel. Get in. I'm coming! Uh, am I going to enjoy this? As my daddy would say, I hope you didn't have a really big breakfast. Ohhh! Ohhh! Copy desk! Ohhh! Ohh! Ohhh! Copy! Over here! Hey, copy- Oh, is this how you always go to work? Yup. Eeshhh. Wait! I can see it now. "Security Gate Guards Caught in Cheesy Bribe." Look here, Reed. I haven't seen anyone take a bribe. And the only cheesy thing around here is your preposterous headlines. My headlines are the only reason anybody reads your stories. Well, my stories are the only reason anyone reads this paper. You know, if you weren't a lady, I'd give you a piece of my mind. And I'd take it. But that would leave you with none to spare. Blast it all, Nellie! Ow, ow, ow! Oh! Who's that? My boss, Reed Daley. Isn't he something. That Manhattan monster is the biggest story in years. But not according to Nellie Brie. No, sir! She's off digging up dirt on politicians and potholes. Look here, I write about facts, not fairy tales. Look, maybe all this talk about a phantom critter is a load of hooey. But until I see some evidence to the contrary, I'll cover it like it's the real McCoy! Because it sells newspapers? That is the business we're in. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got work to do. Where's that new assistant? Right here, Mr. Daley. Call a staff meeting. Gimme a double buttermilk and cancel my 3:00. And get Bert to get those circulation figures on my desk pronto. Huh? Who are you? Me? Ohh! My ears don't look like that! True. But to be accurate, he'd need a bigger piece of paper. All right. Who let in the kid? Oh, Mr. Daley, I'm sorry. Ah-um. He's my brother. My parents made me bring him. So I could ask Miss Brie about the dawdle and the balderdump. The what and the who? The babble and the balderdash. Your so-called monster. Oh, yeah. Well, sorry, kid, but this isn't a baby-sitter service. Yes, sir, Mr. Daley. It won't happen again. Honest. Bu-But I didn't get to ask Miss Brie! Forget it, Fievel. Oh, things could not get any worse. - Yo! Philly! - Wrong. Hey, what are you doin' here? I came with Tanya. Great! Oh, hey there, Mr. D. Do I know you? Sure, I'm Tony Toponi! Your new rovin' reporter. Tony, you are not a reporter. You're a newsboy. Yeah, that too. But I'm makin' big connections on the street. And have I got news for you! He's all ears, obviously. There was another monster attack last night... in Chinatown! This on the up-and-up? Posotootly! Swiped a guy right out of his living room! I heard it was a regular massacree! Blood all over the place! Arms and legs twisted right off! Eyes sucked clean out of their sockets. - Tony! - What? Okay. Here it is! "Monster Strikes Again." Uh, "Fortune Cookie Crumbles for Chinese Mouse." No. Well, I'll think of something. In the meantime, Nellie, go get me that story! Oh, yeah. And take little Rembrandt here with you. - Oh, honestly. Reed! - Look, either he goes with you to Chinatown, or you stay here with him and play baby-sitter. Hey, Roberto. Hi, Luigi. Thanks ever so much for the tip, Mr. Toponi. Ah, no sweat, Miss Brie. You need to know what's up, I'm your guy. Didja, huh? What rug? I didn't- Wasn't me. I'd- Whoa! Tony! Hi, Fievel. Howya doin'? Ah, and what have we here? This is our friend, Tiger. He's a cat. You don't say. What were you doin' in there? Oh, I was just takin' a nap... 'cause- 'cause I'm pooped. You know- You got Tiger workin' for you? No. With! We're partners. He gives me mobility. I give him half the take, after expenses. - What sort of expenses? - Well, with the cost of the papers, advertising and promotion, he clears about ten percent. Mr. Toponi, I think you're going to go far in this business. Really, I do. Bye, guys. See you later. Yeah, later. Bye, Miss Brie. So- So, what did Mr. Daley say? Did he go for you becoming a reporter? Well, not yet. But don't worry. I think he's warmin' up to me. Well, now, what was it you wanted to ask me? Well, it was about... the monster. Oh, I see. All those horror stories have you worried, do they? I'll-I'll say. I've never been so scared in my whole life! I- I'm afraid to go to sleep, and when I do sleep, I get these nightmares that are so- Aw, you must think I'm nothing but a big baby, huh? Not at all, not at all. I know exactly how you feel. Aw, no, you don't. You're fearless! No, Fievel. Only fools are fearless. But I have learned that once you find out the facts about something scary, it helps make the fear go away. - Really? - Really. ♪ When the night is dark with shadows all around ♪ ♪ And the monster's everywhere you turn ♪ ♪ There's a very simple secret I have found ♪ ♪ That anyone with courage can learn ♪ ♪ Get the facts All the whats and wheres and whys ♪ ♪ Get the facts Simply open up your eyes ♪ ♪ Seek the truth find the proof and your fears will all go poof ♪ ♪ Follow the tracks Get the facts ♪ ♪ Get the facts Stick your nose in everywhere ♪ ♪ Get the facts Snoop it here and sniff it there ♪ ♪ Find the clues See it through Do the best that you can do ♪ ♪ Don't be lax Get the facts ♪ ♪ Everyone's afraid at times ♪ But if you use your wits ♪ You'll find what once was scary ♪ ♪ Is really very ordinary ♪ Get the facts?

Try as we can. Doing what we can. Miss Brie. Come on, Fievel. Best you see this for yourself. Say, where's all the blood and stuff? Well, apparently, Mr. Toponi didn't quite get his facts straight. It's a mess, all right. It's hardly a "massacree," as he put it. Hmmm. Which is most peculiar- What you doing here? Get out my house! Go away! Oh, calm yourself, please. We're with the Daily Nibbler. I'm Nellie Brie- - You help us, yes? You get my husband back? Oh, now, now, madam. I only report the news, I-I don't- Well, I shall try. Really, I will. - Now, tell me what happened. - Husband come home. I serve him dinner. Eat real good. Then, room shake, floor split. Awful sound like million angry wasp. Aiiieee! Also smell. Smell like fiery breath of dragon. Then monster rise up. Eyes bright with fire. Teeth flash. Hear cry of husband. Aiiieee! Then... n-nothing. Don't let the fear win. Keep your eyes open to the truth. W- W-What do you mean? Now, is this the kind of impression left by a colossal monster? Well, uh, no. I mean, Tiger's paws are longer than that. So, what do you say you get to work, eh, partner? So, if it isn't a monster wrecking all those homes, who's taking all the mice? That's exactly what we need to find out, isn't it? Who is next? Oh, you. I am getting a vision. I sense that you are from a faraway land. Uh, well, actually, yes. I am! Oh, ho-ho! Just as I thought. And you. Oh, mon petite, I sense a kind heart and a life spent caring for others. Is that not true? - Well, uh, yes. So, I am right again! And you. Ohh! I am feeling, how you say, an impression of pain. Yes, great pain! That- That's true. She's amazing! Hello? Hello. Excuse me. It's Nellie Brie. - Uh, pardon my asking, uh, but what are you, exactly? - I... am Madame Mousey! - Oh, no-no-no. Sorry. I- I mean, what kind of animal are you? - What species? - What do you think? I'm a dog. Um, aren't you kind of small to be a dog? No-o-o-o! I am a miniature poodle. We are by design très petite. Well, I think she looks like a rat. Ohhh! Look, palsey. I am not a rat! You got that? Not, not, not, not! - Okay, okay, okay, okay. - That's a good little mouse. Now- ah-he-he-he- Where were we? You were about to explain yourself. I was, moi? Oh. I am but a humble soothsayer. I travel from town to town, reading the minds, divining the future, providing guidance and hope to all that I meet. And for a small fee, n'est-ce pas? Well, a girl has to make a living, you know? Oh, what's wrong with her? Hmph. Nothing a good kick in the tarot cards wouldn't cure. Owww! All of a sudden, I feel a sense of fear in this place. Oui. Great overwhelming fear! Perhaps, there is something that is threatening you. Something mysterious, supernaturel. Huh? You know, scary! - Well- There is the monster. - A monster! It is fate. Destiny. No wonder I was drawn to this place. To save you from this creature de la nuit. A- And just how exactly do you intend to save us? What is with you? Why, with Madame Mousey's patented essence of dogbane! Yes, ladies and gentlemice, simply hang this enchanted herb in your home, and the monster will flee from your doorstep! I sense that you are not afraid. So, then, you do not believe in the monster. Not until I see it with my own eyes. Come along, Fievel. Adieu. Be careful what you wish for, girlie. You just might get it. Now, which one of you wishes to be protected from the monster? I'm scared! Everybody leave! Pack! Get out of town! Get- Ohhh! - - Mama. Run! It's- It's the mon... ster. W- What happened? You fell asleep in your soup. Oy, oy, oy. My little Fievel. You, I give such a klop in kop! I would've woken him up. At least this way, he might eat a little, sleep a little. Drown a little. It was a shallow bowl. That's all right, Mama. I'm okay. I guess I'm just kind of tired. And no wonder. For weeks you are running around town.I know. Getting all fermisht about this monster madness. I know. And for what? You are too tired to stay awake in the day. And at night, still you don't sleep. I know, Mama! Fievel, mind your manners! I'm sorry. I just thought hanging out with Nellie was supposed to stop me from being so scared. Feh! Who told you that? You did. But it didn't help. Guess I'm nothing but a coward. Now, now, Fievel. Such talk. You could never be a coward. No! I am! The more I see, the more I'm scared! Wait! Fievel! This makes five new attacks in the last two- - What's wrong? - I shop here. I know the owner. Or, rather, I used to. Nellie, s-something's moving. It's-It's the monster! Aaghh! Back for more, is he? Oh, Mr. Haggis, you're alive! What else would I be? Dead? Not likely, laddie. It'll take more than that banshee to pack ol' Haggis off to the pearly gates. So, you saw the monster? Aye! Came up through the floor, like Nessie herself, breakin' the surface of Loch Ness. Nothin' but teeth and fins. H- How did you get away from it? By fightin' the blasted thing with my own paws, that's how! I was just startin' a wee batch of shortbread when it came for me. So I grabbed a vat of melted butter... and poured it right down the beastie's maw! Well, what did it do then? See for yourself! Yuck! You smell that? I certainly do. It's positively putrid. Well then, here we go. - Eewww. It-It's- Just a run of the mill, spit-up- by-a-house-cat hair ball! Start drawing, Fievel. 150, 175, 76, 81, 92- One hundred and ninety-five! Not bad for a day's work. Traitor! Let us outta here! Stinkin' mutt! You're a disgrace to your species, you are! - Shut up, you repulsive little- W- What is the matter with you? You want to know what's the matter? Hokey-dokey, I'll tell you what's the matter. We got greased, man! No. Actually it was... butter? Though, either way, not good 'cause, oy, with the sticky! Did anyone see you? Uh-uh. I got us outta there real, uh- What's the word? - Fast? - Badda-bing. So, so far, the mice, on us, they got nothing. See. Let us see, now. Survives the attack- Survives the attack! Scene of the- Hair ball! Ooh-ooh, not happy! I'm- Oh, see? I got such a touchy tummy. I- Bootlick, tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk, the stomach is not the problem. It's the fact that you got brains the size of a walnut! Don't get cocky with us, Madame. We know all about you. What do you mean? Well, there's a rumor going around 'bout this certain prissy poodle. Wanted to pal with the other stray pooches in town. The problem is, none of the other poochies fell for it. They ran her right out of Central Park. Sound familiar, Mousey? Ze name is "Moo-say." Mousey. Do you hear? That's French! - And, what of you, mes amis? You had it easy. Then the mice built their fortress wall. Suddenly, you're out of food, out of luck and out of business.

Get your paper. Daily Nibbler. Whoop-de-doo. Paper here. Anything in there about the monster? What am I, a librarian? You want to know, buy yourself a copy. Tony? What? Somethin' bothering you? Me? No. Why'd ya ask? Paper. Hey! Get your paper. Fine! So stay ignorant! Tony, no foolin'. You sound kind of, I don't know, cranky. Well, okay, maybe I am. I mean, Tanya's workin' with Mr. Daley. Fievel's hanging out with Nellie Brie. But I am out here poundin' the pavement. Uh, Tony, I'm poundin' the pavement. You're sittin'. Tiger, the point I am makin' is... I can do that reportin' stuff. I believe you, Tony, with all my heart. Only, what you gotta do is dig up a scoop on that Manhattan monster. Then Mr. Daley will have to notice you. Get it? Right. What I need is a clue. Yeah. Sure. A tip! A lucky break. Who don't? Psst! News-personnes! Over here! That was fast. Ain't you that psycho poodle? The word is "psychic," not "psycho." - There's a difference? - Excuse me. Did you say, "poodle"? Oui. I am a poodle. But that would make you a d-d-d- a d-d- - Dog? - Dog! Nay! I thought you were just a rat with big hair. Oh, no, no, no. I am not a rat. Ya got that? I'm not, I'm not, I'm not a rat! Got it. Merci. I am seeking the famous Nellie Brie. - You would not, by chance, know her? - Sure. - No! - Honest! See, me and Nellie Brie, we works together. I'm a reporter too. Of course you are. Which is why I can trust you to give her, how you say, a hot tip. And what exactly is a "teep"? No, no, no, no, no. Not a teep. A tip. Sheesh. You know, a hint. A clue. A lead. Oh, oh. Good. Good. One that will guide her to the hiding place... of the dreaded Manhattan monster. And who gave you this insight? Sorry, Miss Brie, but a professional reporter... should never "digest" his sources. Tony, the word is "divulge." Oh, sure. Get technical. Look here, Reed. This is absolutely absurd. Nellie, if we've got a hot lead on that whatsit, I don't care where it comes from. But, Reed, after all the legwork I've done. You've got nothing but a bunch of hunches that go nowhere. - And a stack of drawings that don't even match. - Of course they don't match. Fievel simply drew this thing the way each witness described it. - I did? - Yes, of course. You see? The Chinese saw a dragon, and the Scottish, a sea serpent, and so forth and so on. It's the same monster. It's just seen through different eyes. Well, maybe. But I still want you to check on this hideout rumor, pronto. Come on, Fievel. We better chase this wild goose before it flies south. But what if the rumor's true? What if the monster's... really there? Good point, Philly. So what say you stay put and I'll go. Whoa, newshound. Not so fast. But Mr. D, it's my tip. Forget it, Tony. Mr. Daley said no, and that's final. Now buzz off. Go! Shoo! Okay, okay, I'm- Boy, I hope we have the wrong address. Ah! Well, just as I thought. Nothing but a wild goose chase. Please tell me I'm having another bad dream! If you are, this would be a good time to wake up. Run! Look at that. Hurry, Nellie! Ohh! Ohh! Fievel! How in the world- Hey. Up here. Tony! Next stop, ground floor. Mr. Toponi, didn't we tell you to stay away from here? Yes, you did. But you came anyway. Yes, I did. As I said, Mr. Toponi, you're going to go far in this business. Now, let's go after that thing. What? Nellie, what if it's still down there waiting for us? Well, then we'll just have to start running again, won't we. That, and hope we don't run out of chandeliers. Ohh! Fievel, take a look at this. Wh-What is it? I believe it is a sewer line. Sure smells like it. Look! Is that a ruby? No, a cheap imitation. A rhinestone. And a clue. Oh, you know, this park is a lot nicer during the day. What do you say we come back then, huh? - S-Sounds good to me. - Oh, now, what are you afraid of? For o-one thing, that. Ah, but you see, that is precisely what we're after. That rhinestone we found is the sort of thing... one sees on human costume jewelry... or on a dog's collar. Did you say d-d-dog? Yes indeed. I have a contact in the Dog High Council. They meet here in the park every night, you know. Oh, that's so ni-ee-uh- Whoa! Whoo! What do you say we go the rest of the way on foot? What are you doing here? Oh, Miss Brie, it's you. That is one big bowwow. Yes. He's the contact I mentioned. These are my associates, Mr. Mousekewitz and Mr. Toponi. - What about that? - H-He's our friend. Yeah. Who are you? You may call me Lone Woof. Do you recognize this? Where did you find it? At an old house in Carmansville, after we were attacked by- - Uh- - By the Manhattan monster? What is it? How can we stop it?

Get everybody back here. We need all the paws we got. Mickey, start up the presses. What you got for me, kid? Kid? That house was owned by the Public Works chief and his wife... till they moved out six months ago. So? So the wife is also... the owner of the dog in the poster. Bingo! Movin' day comes, and the poodle takes a powder. Nice work, sweetheart. Sweetheart? Move it, boys! We got a paper to put out! - Okay, Rembrandt, you're on. - W-Well, I drew on the missing dog poster, like Nellie said. It's just as I told you, Reed. Our mysterious madame is a match for the missing mutt. Which ties Mousey to the house. Boy, that's the last tip I take from her! What? Well, uh, yeah. She was the one who told me to check out that old house... where you... almost- Oh, how could I be so stupid? Practice? That clinches it! Nellie, I need your story in ten minutes. I thought you might. Newshawk. Get that ink over to the press. On the double. I'm goin'. I'm goin'. By the way, Rembrandt, you can stay. - What about me, Reed? - I'll let you know after I read your article. Nellie, how come Mr. Daley's always so mean to you? Well, it only sounds that way. He's really crazy about me, poor thing, and it upsets him terribly. You see? Actually, no. Uh-uh-uh. Huh? Ooh, loud! And with the pain! Oh, easy, man. I'm hurtin' here. Yo, me too, okay? And I'm doin' the heavy liftin'. Hey, Twitch. What happened? Ya wanna know what happened? I'll tell ya what happened. We got bamboozled is what happened! Bushwhacked by a bunch of mealy-mouthed mice. And you wanna know why this happened? I'll tell you why. 'Cause Fifi there had another one of her high-falutin' plans! Huh? Which would have worked- ouch- if you bunglers had followed orders. Is that so? Well, you won't have to put up with us anymore, Curly, 'cause we're done playin' fetch. It's time the doggie took a walk. You know, you're really trying my patience here. You can't fix the machine without my help. Wake up and smell the catnip, Mousey. I'm sayin' we don't need your machine or your help. No, see? We already got Mousey's sewer maps, right? Uh-huh. Yeah. And if we know where the sewers go, we got us a way... around that stupid security gate, right? So what I'm sayin' here is... au revoir, Madame Mousey. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hang on, fellas. - I mean, let's all stop and think about this for a minute. What about the mice that got away? Huh? What about Nellie Br-r-rie? What about Nellie Brie? While we stand here arguin', she's off writin' a story about how the monster is a fake. And once the mice read that, you won't have the element of surprise on your side. And they'll fight back! - All right, all right, all right! Lemme guess. You got another one of your plans. But of cour-r-rse. "Hot Dog Linked To Manhattan Monster- Seer Suckered Us All." Heh. Perfect, if I do say so myself. And I do. Ladies and gents, consider this paper put to bed. Now, I suggest the same for all of you. Good night. See you tomorrow. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Oh, Mr. Daley. That was amazing! You put that whole paper together in just a few hours! Yep. Reminds me of my field correspondent days during the Civil War. Heh! Really gets your heart pumping, doesn't it? Oh, yes. Now, go home, kid. It's late. Oh, no, Mr. Daley. I can stay as long as you need me. I mean to help, um, tidy up. Me, I'm gonna go find Tiger... and tell him I'm a reporter. You mean, cub reporter, part-time. And remember, you and that cat still have to deliver the papers... starting at dawn. Yes, sir, Mr. D. You're the cheese. And don't call me "cheese." Would you like me to walk you home? It is late, you know. I'll be okay, Nellie. Fievel, there's nothing wrong with being scared. Sometimes, fear is the thing that saves us... from doing something foolish. Now remember, Mousey and that whatsit of hers... are still lurking about out there. So keep your eyes open, eh? Right. Eyes open. You bet. Keep your eyes open. It's okay to be scared. Keep your eyes open. Keep your eyes open. Yeah. I'll be okay. Eyes op- Mama! Papa! No! Mama, Papa, Yasha, no. It can't be! Th-The monster! No. No, no! Tiger? Fievel, I could have a heart attack tryin' to keep up. - I thought you were the monster. - What? The monster? Whoa! Where? Whoo! Philly! Tony, the monster- I mean, Madame Mousey- I mean, she- they got my family! I know. Mousey's gone nuts with that monster of hers, whatever it is. All over town, she's grabbing mice like it was a fire sale. Tiger, we can't stop Mousey by ourselves. We need help. You've got to go to the dogs! D- D-D-D- Who? That's right. The dogs. But- I'm a cat. Feline, you know. I mean, dogs and us, we just don't- Tiger, you're the only one who can get there fast enough! Yes, well, that may be, but- Honest. You'll be fine. After all, Lone Woof knows who you are. He- He does? How? You remember. In the park? 'Course, you was unconscious when you was introduced. Sometimes I think it's better that way. Tiger! What? If you don't go, my family, all the other families- It's gonna be too late for 'em. You're our only hope! Okay, Fievel. You can count on me. I'll do it. Central Park, here I come! Ooh. That way. Hurry, Tiger! Hurry! So now, what do we do? Find my family! Somethin' really smells about this place. - I know what you mean. - No, I mean it really smells! Like that sewer pipe we saw under the house. Tony, that's it! Remember what Tanya said? Madame Mousey's owner was the wife of the Public Works chief! - So? - So that means he's the guy in charge of- Sewers! Look. Oh, yoo-hoo? Dogs? Anybody home? Oh, well. Must be their night off. Who goes there? Cold! Cold and wet! Oh, there's so many. How dare you defile the sacred fountain! Oh, no. Look, sir, I'm puttin' it back. See, good as new. We are the Dog High Council. Hi. I'm Ti-Ti-Ti- You are a cat! A shiftless and unworthy eater of mice. Oh, n-n-no. No. You got me all wrong. I like mice. I, uh- I mean- but not that way- Not the way you're thinkin'. I just like to be- Silence! Oh, please! I didn't wanna come here, honest. But the mice, see, they need help. We have no interest in the affairs of mice. Yeah, but only- See, this monster keeps grabbin' 'em. It's not really a monster. You see, it's a- - Okay. Go ahead. Chew me to bits. I don't care. You're all nothin' but a bunch of bullies, goin' around scarin' everybody, just like that crazy poodle. Huh? Did you say poodle? Okay, what ya got? A new batch. They're from the basement of Luigi's Restaurant. Oh, perfect. Our customers love Italian food. Oh, almost got ya. I love it when they beg. Hey, you, with the fish-breath. It's Papa. So you think you are tough, scaring women and children? Shame on you! Shameful! What are you doing? You want them to eat you? They're going to eat us anyway. Maybe I can give them a little indigestion beforehand. - What's the problem, old mouse? Feeling left out? Don't worry. Yeah. We got cats all over town, just lined up to buy our product. Yup. We steal. They make a deal. And you are the meal. Well, you sure showed them, Mr. Smarty-pants. Now who has the indigestion? That does it. Let's get 'em. Tony, wait! We're two mice against a dozen cats. What's a matter, you scared? Well, yeah! And there's nothing wrong with that. 'Scuse me! Tony, doing something dangerous doesn't always mean you're brave. Sometimes, it only means you're dumb. We rush in there without using our heads, we'll get stomped. Yeah, but, Philly, your family's over there lookin' like the catch of the day. Look, I'll go get Nellie. She'll know what to do. Oh, for cryin' out- Please, Tony. Promise you won't do anything till I get back. All right. I promise. I still say we coulda took 'em. Do you realize, Madame, you're quite mad? Huh? The newspaper office! I would not say mad. How's about stark raving... rabid! But- But why? "Why?" Because my whole life, I have been compared to you vermin! "Oh, isn't she cute, like a little mouse. What do you feed her, cheese? Hey, look at the rat on the leash!" I got your leash, pal! Come on! Right here, you and me! Then, opportunity knocked. Watch your step. Movin' day came, and a door was left open. I escaped from my owner. And I joined my fellow canines in the park. The only thing is, they didn't want you. No. Can you believe it? They called me... "Lapdog" and "Powder puff." Et voilà, here I am, in charge of a bunch of cats instead. But it all worked out. Thanks to my little invention, I am able to pass along my misery to you! The monster. Oh, no. Once you find out the facts about something scary, it helps make your fear go away. No! You're not real! You're fake! It's- It's only a machine. Listen, Mousey, show is over. Nobody's gonna buy that monster malarkey, after they read The Daily Nibbler. Only, they ain't gonna read it. You see, tomorrow, the rodents of New York will wake up to find that... the offices of The Daily Nibbler have been trashed. And you? Simply the latest victims of the Manhattan Monster. You see, I have thought of every- thing. Nail that pest! What? - What? Where is- Boy, that is one dumb cat. Tanya! Glad you dropped by, Rembrandt. Oh, come on. Get this thing movin'. Okay, now, it's time to feed the monster. - Oh, no. Fievel! Get back here, kid. Yeah. Now smash the presses. Over my dead body! - Honestly, Reed, your dead body is exactly what they're after! Wake up, Fievel. I mean it. Aw, leave me alone, Tanya. I haven't slept in- Maybe we could lose 'em in the newspaper office upstairs. Oh, do let's try. Oh, I don't like this. Fievel shoulda been back by now. Mmm. Hey, I'm gettin' hungry. What do you say we grab us a snack? Hey, you know the rules. No eatin' the inventory. Who's gonna tell on us, you? Me? No. Uh- I'm goin' on my break. Bye. Oh, boy. Promise or no. I gotta- Ow! Hey. "Emergency release valve." Mama, Yasha, no! Papa! Hey, lookey, I got the combo-meal. - Ow! - That's my baby! Then say bye-bye, Daddy. Hmm? I'm comin', Mr. "M." - Hey, you, Mr. and Mrs. "M." Tony, did you do this? Yep! I figured if there's one thing cats hate more than gettin' hungry, it's gettin' wet. Hurry, everyone! The guards are gone! Unlock the gates and swim for your lives! Tony, where's Fievel? Relax, Mrs. "M." I'm sure he's fine. Run him down! Reed, I hope this works. It better. Now, if Fievel and Tanya can just lure those cats in here. Here they come. Wait. Not yet. Now! - Uh-oh. Did we get 'em all? Yep. - Yep. Nope. Run, Nellie! - Reed! Don't worry, girlie. I'll take care of the both of ya. Huh? Hey, Cat, what's the problem? I thought you guys always land on your feet. Fievel, what are you doing? Come out, you little rat! Ya know ya can't get away. Maybe you'd better spell it out for me. I am losing my patience here! You little stinkin'- Okeydokey. Now, I'm gonna finish this the old-fashioned way. I'm gonna eat ya! Huh? "Pull to engage... printing press." What's goin' on here? Hey, slow down! Slow down! Hey, you. Let me out of here. I can't move. Anybody? Fievel? I- I'm okay. Oh, yeah? Hey, where's Twitch, Slug? I don't know. What do we do? Well, if I were you, I'd start running! Come on, out of my way! Well, that settles that. Wait a minute. Where's Tiger? If you hurt him, I'll- My, my. So bold for such a small mammal. Okay, Rat-face, keep movin'. Yo, fooey, look what we found... tryin' to crawl back into the sewer. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Watch where you stick that, cat! Or I'll turn on you like a vicious- Lapdog? Moi? Well, now, it's Mousey's turn to look for help from above. - Lone Woof? - Sh! Mmm. Oh, I was so afraid you were- Relax, kid, I'm- Nellie! Nellie, you're okay! Of course I am, Reed. You saved my life, though I don't know what possessed you. Don't play dumb with me, Nell. It's 'cause I'm crazy about ya! - Yes, I know. - You do? But when I saw that cat goin' after you, nothin' else mattered. My word, Reed, that almost sounds like a proposal. So, what are you sayin', no? Well, no. But, honestly, Reed, you do realize that we'll be utterly miserable together? Aw, lady, I'm countin' on it. Tanya? Here, Papa. Tanya, my bubeleh. Gee, is she gonna be okay? I have no idea. I got pickles. I got celery. I got cheese. I got more cheese. What's the point? Oh, I don't care. Life has no meaning. That's nice. Now eat a knish. The outlaw cats, wet and sneezing, were last seen fleeing up Eighth Avenue. Ooh, I love a story with a happy ending. Thanks to our brave little boy. That's right, Fievel. You helped Nellie Brie find the monster... that was hiding right under our noses. And in return, she helped you find courage... that was hiding right under your nose, in here. I wonder what the Dog Council did with Mousey. Well, according to my sources- - Your sources? - Well, okay, Nellie's sources. Anyway, the dogs made sure that Mousey's gonna pay big for what she done. You mean, they stuck her in the city pound? Worse. Much worse. Come, come, Mousey-Wousey. - Oh, Mrs. Abernathy, is that your lost poodle? Yes. Someone must have seen the posters I put up in the park. Oh, how wonderful for you! Odd thing, though. Whoever brought her home just left her on the porch... all wrapped up in the morning paper like a day-old fish. Poor thing couldn't move a muscle. And her fur was stained and scorched, oh, dear. But at least I have her back, and from now on, I'll never let her out of my sight again. Never, never, never, never, never, never, never. Now, maybe Fievel can finally calm down and get some sleep. You were saying? Sweet dreams, my little Fievel. Sweet dreams.
