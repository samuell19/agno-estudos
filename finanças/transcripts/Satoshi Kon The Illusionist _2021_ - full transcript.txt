One, please. Of all the people I've worked with, nobody else provides the unique sensations he does. Satoshi Kon broadened the scope of animation. He created animated films that were as powerful as live-action films. That's the overriding impression I get from his work. To sum it up, he was a prickly guy. He spoke his mind. Even if the other person might get hurt, he never held back. He said what he wanted to say. He was radical that way. I remember that well. I'd never seen the Japanese style of animation used just for a real adult, dramatic story. It was very clear he was this kind of one-man machine. It felt like he just kind of did his thing in his cocoon, and created his work. That was my feeling of his genius. For me, Satoshi Kon was not just a great director. He was also a great mentor and teacher, as well as an activist who was trying to improve the animation industry for its creators. He had this ability to make the audience smart. You can't leave your brain on the couch with his work. He's an osteopath for the brain. Always ahead of us. This is a filmmaker who's expanding the boundaries of film making. And not just animation. A lot of people in live action are chasing the Satoshi Kon feel, that level of immersiveness. He's a master. Someone I'll be learning from for the rest of my life. Kon, in a word, is a genius. And a nasty guy. In a nutshell. SATOSHI KON: THE ILLUSIONIST On August 24th, 2010, at the age of 46, mangaka and filmmaker Satoshi Kon died. His body of work is not immense. A handful of comics, four feature films, one short, and a TV series. But his contribution to the history of animation, and Japanese cinema in general, is fundamental. He even influenced Hollywood cinema in the 2010s. Satoshi Kon's broken trajectory is that of a visionary and essential early 21st century artist. I refuse to do it! In 1998, Perfect Blue, Kon's first feature, is released worldwide... The film is a thriller about a young pop singer harassed by a fan when she decides to quit the music industry. The film's daring narrative and dark, tense atmosphere make it an instant classic of adult animated cinema and catapult Kon onto the international stage. Born in 1963, Satoshi Kon began writing and drawing mangas as a boy. He was first published at the age of 22. It all began when I was in art school. I planned to become a mangaka. When I started out in the profession, I was already a fervent admirer of Katsuhiro Otomo's mangas, like Akira. His style inspired me in my own comics. In my mangas and animated films, the core of my personal vision is clearly influenced by Otomo. Other magazines for young people were mostly read by students and office workers. White collar, basically. Whereas Young Magazine tended to be read by blue-collar workers and young slackers. Kon's first two award-winning mangas were works of science fiction. They were clearly influenced by Otomo. What's most important in drawing is expressivity. I was his supervisor at the time. I was very impressed by the power of his drawings. Foreign filmmakers took an interest in Kon's early mangas. Marc Caro, whose films with Jeunet were popular in Japan, hoped to bring the most popular one to the screen. Why was I interested in Kaikisen? I felt the story was so timeless, so international.. You could place it in any context. This conflict between tradition and a kind of raging modernity hurtling towards who knows what... It felt very current. The relationship to the sea, the mermaids, all the sea-related mythology... I was hooked from the start. So, obviously, I met Satoshi Kon. It turned out, we both admired each other. And we had a lot in common. I had a great story to tell. And, on top of that, I had the blessing and enthusiasm of the person I admired, who'd written the story. I was beyond overjoyed! Satoshi Kon was already known at the time. I wasn't the one who discovered his talent. It was already clear to everybody. I made him an offer. The timing was good for both of us. It was the beginning of a very important collaboration. And now, without further ado, please welcome CHAM! The first meeting with Mr. Takeuchi, the author of the original book, took place at Madhouse studio. He was very frank. He gave us permission to modify his book. So we had a lot of freedom. It was a suspenseful book, with a heavy dose of the grotesque. Mr. Kon and I decided we wanted to do something different. So, what would we do? Mr. Kon wrote down a few notes. "A man pursues a woman, "a woman pursues her own shadow." As we wrote down all those notes, we decided that would be our concept for the film. Perfect Blue quickly stood out. In particular, on the international stage. It was seen as the work of an auteur. Satoshi Kon began to be seen as a major animated filmmaker. But when you place it in the context of what Madhouse produced in the 90s, it's very coherent. It corresponds exactly to what Maruyama was trying to do. Animated films for older audiences. Darker, with a more realistic aesthetics. I suggested we try cutting it in pieces and mixing it all up, so we wouldn't know where we were going. He said, "We gotta try it!" He was up for the challenge. It's me, Mima Kirigoe from CHAM! When I met Satoshi Kon, I could see that he didn't know I'd started out as an idol. That made me happy. Perfect Blue latched onto the Japanese phenomenon of forming musical groups with the express intention of creating idols. Casting bands of future idols. The film asks Japanese audiences to ponder the fates of these young women, so quickly discarded, and whose short careers expose them to harsh public scrutiny. Idols must always be smiling. We have to sing and dance, even with a fever. Idols are like puppets. And in their private lives, they are all the more tormented. I was happy that Satoshi Ken had taken an interest in it. These very smiley idols were popular in the 1980s. They were wildly popular. They were on all the TV shows. Then came the 1990s and the "Underground Idol" craze. The distance between idols and their fans narrowed. A fax? Who can that be? Traitor traitor tRaitoR TRAiTor TrAItOR Who are you? I myself had to deal with a stalker. I brought that anxiety to my acting. It was surely what made me stand out during the audition. Perfect Blue is a really, really good horror movie. And as a horror movie, you can connect to it many different ways. You can compare it to Alfred Hitchcock, you can link it to Dario Argento, you can link it to the maze-like movies that you get with some of the David Lynch work. What's striking in Perfect Blue is the way Satoshi Kon appeals to the audience's intelligence and imagination. Is Mima an idol? Did Mima dream she was a celebrity? Is Mima being pursued by a psycho killer? Is the head of Mima's talent agency killing everyone around her? A variety of possible worlds exist within the linear story of Perfect Blue. The film seems to say that all these fictional states are simultaneously co-existing. As the film goes on, you do get the sense... of an escalating nightmare. The situation is getting more and more menacing. There's a feeling of hysteria. As with Mima, you start to feel the sanity slipping away. And I just remember thinking, "This film is too disturbing for me." I don't like this. I don't think I like the director either. Because it seems as though, why does he have to torment this girl so much? Why does she have to suffer so much? Why does he have to portray so much? I think it literally was day one, I spoke with him and I asked him about Perfect Blue. "Your portrayal of women isn't always nice." And he says, "That's because they're me." I was like, "That's very interesting." He said, "I don't know why, but when I represent myself in a film..." He said he himself is always in his movies. Especially with Perfect Blue. Mima is Satoshi Kon. The psychological torment that Mima is going through is the torment he has experienced with the politics of the anime and the comic book industry. So that's when my perspective of him totally changed. The first time I saw the film, I couldn't stop crying. My thoughts were all over place. I felt it was good to have made this film. That my family might be surprised. I felt joy, but I was also worried. All these thoughts swirling in my head. Some said the film was original. They said it was very striking, and that it left a strong impression. I can't say that the world of anime thought much of the film. To be blunt – we lost money. I think I met him before I saw the work. My memory is I met him when I was in Japan promoting my first movie, Pi. Which probably was in 1998. They were like, "There's a filmmaker." I'm not sure why, but we got together and we had a meal. I think we went to a tempura restaurant. I remember him talking to me a little bit about a movie. I was very interested in anime. I didn't really quite-- It was early days in anime, at least for Westerners. I think, shortly after that, I did see Perfect Blue. I was blown away by it, it was fantastic. And it was very different than any other anime I had seen. Bastards! In Requiem for a Dream, I was probably in the script process. I was looking for a scene to get the internal mindset of Jennifer Connelly's character Mary. And probably at the same time, I saw Perfect Blue. And I remember writing to Satoshi in Japan, saying, "Hey, would you mind if I used one of your shots, in homage to you, "but it would help this moment in my film." He was very flattered. I remember he was fine, and generous. So don't worry, Seymour. It'll all work out. You'll see already. In the end it's all right. Eventually we went back to Japan with Requiem for a Dream. I asked him what he thought of the shot. He said he was very proud. So it was great. It was a lot of fun to have that connection with him. So at a certain point, we tried to get the rights to do a version of it in live action. It was very complicated to do it, because no one understood what a pop star was, understood this kind of character. There was no real character. Britney Spears hadn't really happened in America yet. So we didn't really have that type of character for people, so it was hard for them to understand. I think now would be a good time. People understand that character. We're 10-15 years behind that cultural phenomenon in Japan. Perfect Blue explores Kon's idea that the universe, and its representations, are but one. Dream worlds, virtual worlds and reality merge and interact. It was inevitable that Satoshi Kon would soon explore cinema itself. I was truly blown away when I discovered Perfect Blue. So I contacted the producer Maruyama and told him he absolutely had to introduce me to Kon. Perfect Blue didn't really receive the recognition of the industry. It was pretty humiliating. We had to take another chance. Usually when your film tanks, you don't make another one. But we like a challenge, so we said, "Let's give the audience "something that'll really impress them!" I think this film falls more into the literary category. The main character is a great actress who has retired. An old woman. I feared that wouldn't attract the crowds, and I said as much to the director. Nice to meet you. I'm Chiyoko Fujiwara. This is a big day. What an honor to meet you! He said there'd be young girls too, and he'd draw Chiyoko young. He told me not to worry. And he assured me he'd mix fiction and reality and use lots of visual tricks. Can I say something? No. My mother... thinks acting is a dubious profession. Did she say dubious? Madam! The film is set in Manchuria. It will raise troop morale and encourage the people of our nation! I'm sure Chiyoko wants to serve her country! Millennium Actress is a fascinating film in the way it uses the history of Japanese cinema. We follow the great actress Chiyoko, said to have been inspired by Setsuko Hara. Both actresses started out in propaganda films, as we see Chiyoko do in Millennium Actress. Setsuko Hara was a great actress. Even though she's not from my generation, she was a superstar. But she left cinema and retired in Kamakura. We knew her story and thought it was wonderful. Her life was fascinating. This gave Kon a chance to explore his relationship with cinema and create a universe, at once complex and obvious, in which we constantly vacillate between the reality of life and the reality of films. When Mr. Kon and I discussed cinema, Slaughterhouse 5 was the first reference we had in common. A whole swathe of artists in Japan experienced that film like an electroshock. It wasn't just that the chronology was mixed up. It was defined by the movements of the heart. The film maintains a narrative thread, even though the scenes are out of order. How much can the audience understand? The film served as an experiment in answering that question. The sequence of the scenes is out of order, but the film remains clear. For us, and all other members of the audience. That is the film's major strength. From an aesthetic point of view, I wanted to play with the same types of effects. I told the whole crew of my intentions. On Perfect Blue, the influence was purely technical. But for Millennium Actress, I took on the themes. Millennium Actress shows that inside a human being, memories, the present, the past and the future co-exist. I think the themes of Slaughterhouse 5 influenced me precisely in that direction. It's the key to what matters most. What matters most? Give me until tomorrow. Promise? Millennium Actress is built around a key that was given to the heroine. She keeps the key throughout the film, trying to find the person who had passed it along. The key becomes a symbol of the intertwining storylines. A symbol of how difficult it is to find a key that will solve all the mysteries the character is facing. Millennium Actress seems to be the story of Japanese cinema. It shows all kinds of Japanese movies. From domestic dramas to Godzilla movies. It also seems to encompass the whole of modern Japanese history, starting about a thousand years ago and moving up to World War II and beyond. To evoke the various periods, we needed a wide variety of material. We had to find accessories to inspire our drawings, scout locations... I did a lot of research. We looked to Ozu for the ending, when Chiyoko is a bit older. There's a scene with her mother. Ozu's work was a major reference for us. I'll find him! You don't even know if he's alive! He's alive! I know he is! He was very much into getting into people's minds and and into the internal monologues. And I guess that's something very common for live action, but it's definitely unique for animation to treat your characters with such psychological depth. If anyone is a dubbing legend, it's Shōzō Iizuka. He has played hundreds of animated characters, over a career which began in the late 1960s. Here and there in the film, you sense the smells, images and all the rest in a very realistic way. Up to that point, in the world of animation, we had many people who wrote with talent, but they preferred style over substance. From Millennium Actress on, people wanted to live up that film. People worked harder to write better animated films. That tells you how good that film is. In my opinion. The first time we met, I didn't know if he was Japanese or not. He had a really unique aura. I thought he might be Chinese. So I was pretty nervous when we met. Then, talking to him, he turned out to be very nice. You could tell he was sure of himself and knew what he wanted. Usually, experience teaches us what we're capable of. But Mr. Kon never asked himself such questions. He felt he could do anything. And in the moment, that made me feel enormous pressure. The film won the top prize at the Japan Media Arts Festival. But it was the year of Spirited Away, so, exceptionally, they gave the prize to both films. When it came to the final line of the film, he says it reflects his own way of pursuing things in his own life. He also says that the relationship between the heroine and the man she's seeking was like the relationship between a director and the ideal movie he had in his head. As it turns out, chasing after him is what I like best. He was... abandoned. If you want to start watching Satoshi Kon's films, anybody's recommendation would be to start with Tokyo Godfathers. Because it's fun, it's light, but it's very beautiful. It's a Christmas gift sent from the sky! It's our baby! What? Each new Satoshi Kon film got all the filmmakers talking. I've seen them all. From one film to the next, the tone can change radically. Take Perfect Blue and Millennium Actress. They explore similar themes, but they're very different. And Tokyo Godfathers takes us to another place entirely. The way he reinvents himself each time through such different genres shows us that cinema, holds infinite possibilities. Even his quick pencil sketches looked like photographs. Add to that his vast knowledge of the art of drawing, and his work is very rich. Sometimes he felt the work itself would overtake him. And it was important for him to question his aesthetic tastes. After Millennium Actress, I thought we could do a simple story. I thought we could remove all those layers, and it would still hold up. So I proposed something a bit lighter and more entertaining. The film really delves into Japanese society in a way rarely seen, especially in animation. He chose to explore marginal characters. A runaway girl, homeless people... This was significant. It allowed Kon, in his way, to stand up for a Japan that was hurting. To give voice to those left behind by the economic miracle. It's quite raw, quite violent. But zaniness is injected throughout. Hilarious scenes, lighter stuff. And this very simple situation – a baby landing providentially in the arms of 3 homeless men – launches us on a voyage through Tokyo, the sordid underbelly of Tokyo. Not the Tokyo tourists see. I was really into it. I love the freedom of tone. It really works. He's a bad gambler, a coward, his feet stink, he drinks too much! He claims his wife and daughter are dead to get pity! He claims you have an incurable disease! I feel sorry for you, having him for a father! This is where I discovered Shinji Otsuka, the animator. He animated the sequences in the hospital, of the drag queen going crazy. Her acting is so extreme. He showed me the folder, because it was in the studio. The folder was about that thick, just for one scene. And it was submitted to Kon. In Japan, the animators animate, and then the directors apply the corrections on top. But because there was so much paper, he just sat back, going, "I can't correct this, there's too many drawings." But he watched the animation and he loved it so much. He said Tokyo Godfathers was the most fun he had in any film that he directed. All the animators started going really wacky and mad and expressive. He said every time the animators got crazier and crazier, he had to instruct Mr. Ike, the art director, "More realistic! More realistic!" Because the animation was becoming so surreal, he needed something to keep the world in reality. I got a lot of praise for the depiction of Tokyo in Tokyo Godfathers. I was interested in exploring parts of Tokyo not usually seen, like the alleyways and paths I would take on my way to work. I'd always wanted to show Tokyo as I knew it. The director shared my desire. When he told me he'd be using that side of Tokyo in his next film, I knew the job was for me. We tried to be extremely faithful. We wanted Tokyo to become a character in itself. The film was influenced by a western, a Hollywood film called 3 Godfathers. Because of the framework, which is 3 adults who find this baby. It's something that's been done in other movies, obviously. There was a French comedy, which was then remade as a Hollywood film, Three Men and a Baby. It's a familiar template, but Kon turns it his particular way. We had such fun here, didn't we? ♪ In this old bar ♪ ♪ I've drained so many glasses ♪ ♪ My memories too ♪ ♪ Are draining away ♪ He used to really make us laugh in the evenings, dressing up as a woman. He loved to do that. Surprise his friends, crack everyone up. To him, in all things, frontwards and backwards co-exist. The front alone didn't interest him, nor did the back alone. Every single film, he financially struggled, to make sure that the animators were paid quite well. People say he's really established as a director, he's very respected. At the end of the day, the reality and the politics of the film industry is that if he's not making big bucks like Ghibli is, he really isn't 100% respected by the industry itself. Between the moment we finished Millennium Actress and its theater release, a year passed. So we threw ourselves into producing Tokyo Godfathers. Millennium Actress was praised by the critics. It was considered a masterpiece. But for a director who still hadn't had a hit at the box office, it was very difficult to finance the next film. For that reason, Kon told me I'd brought shame to the profession. In the middle of the project, I got booted off the project. When we started working together, he wasn't yet known. But he did consider himself to be a genius. I think that's how he saw himself. Seraphim was a project for a manga series. As he did for Otomo, each panel was fully-developed. It was admirable. I remember thinking that there weren't many mangakas able to express in their drawing what I wanted to convey. Especially in this case. There were so many important details. I would've loved to have him drawing for me to the end. But from the start, my desire to collaborate with him was an unrealistic idea. He was someone who confined himself to his own works. Working on a manga that I'd written no doubt hurt his pride. Every time we got together, we ended up getting in a fight. We only ended up with one volume. We reached a dead-end. The level of conflict we experienced as collaborators was totally new to me. We had no choice but to abandon the project. Paranoia Agent, right? When I saw it, I thought, "Wow!" Personally, I really like things like that. You don't know what's going to happen, and you need that kind of suspense in a series. He should have done series instead of cinema. Satoshi Kon's answer to Twin Peaks, Paranoia Agent spends 13 episodes pursuing a mysterious rollerblading aggressor terrorizing Tokyo, in a narrative and graphic maelstrom unprecedented in animated series. Welcome to M&F. No, sorry. We couldn't reach her. That's all I know. I'm going to check the hospital. The victim of this savage aggression is the creator of the famous Maromi, Tsukiko Sagi... For Satoshi Kon, it was a very experimental piece where he was playing around. Every episode, he was playing around a little bit with different styles. It was kind of a study period for him. He would assign a handful of directors to direct the different episodes. Satoshi Kon wanted each episode to have its own identity. Character designer Masashi Ando created many characters for Ghibli before leaving the studio after Spirited Away. At a certain point, I wanted to take a different direction. And that's when Satoshi Kon came to me. I wanted to be part of his universe. It was so exciting. And it could enrich me in so many ways. I think if someone other than Mr. Kon had been directing, such drawings never would have seen the light of day. In ordinary animation productions, we were content to draw cute girls, handsome boys... But when Mr. Kon saw things like that, he would wax ironic. He'd point out the characters' imperfections, and tell us that was part of their charm, and the charm of humanity in general. Working with him as a character designer was a great opportunity for me. Throughout the series, we see the figure of the boy with the bat. This character embodies the potentially horrifying, intrusive idea of dreams seeping into reality. We see here the beginnings of the work he further develops on Paprika. The porosity that can exist between nightmares, dreams and reality. Paranoia Agent is built around the idea of alienation and the inner transformation individuals undergo when they construct a micro-fiction. The boy with the bat embodies this. He represents a collective fiction that sparks paranoia in society. Satoshi Kon's vision may be extremely negative. But we see all the elements pushing an individual over the edge. You rang? What makes the series both optimistic and unsettling at the end, is that everything is resolved, but starts again. To get by in life, we all need an escape. Through fantasies, dreams, or even paranoia. Otherwise, life is too hard. The way an individual sees the world is altered by his fantasies or paranoia. So I don't think paranoia is necessarily unhealthy. The series gets us thinking about our mobile phones. In hindsight, we see that the series develops a fairly elaborate, precursory theory about all these communication devices that isolate people and shut them down more than they facilitate communication. It makes lots of satirical points about the pressures of society, the pressures of the workplace, about masculinity. There's one episode, I think episode 3, Double Lips, that seems like a kind of funny, campy remake of Perfect Blue, with another woman with a frightening split personality. Shut up and follow me. You're hurting me, stop! You make me sick. Paprika is kind of the positive flip side to Paranoia Agent. In much the same way as Millennium Actress was the positive flip side to Perfect Blue. One of the most obvious is the figure of the policeman who drives the plot. Both Paprika and Paranoia Agent have women who have double personalities, which again arguably goes back to Perfect Blue. In Paranoia Agent, the two split personalities are fighting each other. Whereas in Paprika, they have some arguments, but they support and empower each other. It's the greatest show time! I think Paprika's charm lies in the unprecedented visual impact it had. It was brand new. I think Paprika is a beautiful film. There's something joyful about it. I would say it's the most fun of Satoshi Kon's movies. For his final feature – and biggest hit –, Satoshi Kon tells the story of scientists who invent a machine to visit dreams, that gets stolen. Professor Chiba sends her dream-word double, Paprika, to visit suspects' subconscious. The film is an adaptation of a novel by Yasutaka Tsutsui. The legendary author's work has often been brought to the screen. But Paprika was considered unadaptable. Tsutsui is an author of science fiction. Beyond that, he's a distinguished literary figure. He went as far as writing about language itself. It got to a point where it became difficult to adapt his work. It had such a wide scope. It was so unique, so bountiful. He is utterly original and very avant-garde. All that makes him a bit of a star in the eyes of people of my generation. Among Satoshi Kon's influences, Yasutaka Tsutsui is huge. Tsutsui's work was a very important element in his personal development. I understood that very well. So when we worked on Paprika together, I let him do what he wanted, eyes closed. I had seen many works by Satoshi Kon, and I liked everything I saw. Millennium Actress was the one I liked the most. It explores one of the recurring themes in my novels, the confrontation between reality and fiction. This theme runs through all of Satoshi Kon's work. Only Kon could adapt Paprika. So I asked him to do it. I'd read the novel ten years prior and really loved it. In Perfect Blue and Millennium Actress, I'd subconsciously tried to recreate the world of Paprika. I only kept the bare bones of the story in my film. The rest was modified. The story of Paprika is so gigantic, it was impossible to boil it down to 90 minutes. So, either you do a synopsis of the work – which is not interesting in comparison to the novel – or you decide to do something completely different. Paprika really affected me profoundly, because we were adapting at the same time, for Madhouse, a novel by Tsutsui. What angle would Kon take in his Tsutsui adaptation? I wondered that, as I was directing The Girl Who Leapt Through Time. And when I saw it, I felt that it was so limpid. Expressing Tsutsui's work in that way was so impressive. In a film like this, we go from the world of dreams to reality, and vice versa. You mustn't let the audience know exactly where the frontiers lie between these two dimensions. We mustn't know where dreams begin and reality ends, and vice versa. No other director was capable of pulling that off. Kon was the one and only. I just remember saying, "I thought Paprika was really really nice. "I like the fact that it was quite dark, in comparison to the trailer." He said, "I didn't intend it to be dark. You think it was dark?" I was like, "Very!" He was saying that was meant to be my big commercial prostitute film debut. And he was like, "Paprika is my Sailor Moon project. "She's the magical girl who can transform into anything." I was like, "I don't think people saw it that way." Satoshi Kon really became the blinking light I was aiming for with Spider-Verse. It blew me away. The level of subtlety, the textures, the risks that he was taking in almost every aspect of his film making. It was something that I and the crew of Spider-Verse could watch and say we want to make something that can tiptoe up to the realm of this. Paprika just created its own feel. It was transporting. It was unnerving. It wasn't just a movie about bending reality, it was a movie that captured what it feels like to have reality bended. From that, I really learned one of the main lessons that I thought a lot about during the making of Into the Spider-Verse, which is that animation doesn't have to look real, it just has to feel real. It just has to feel like some aspect of reality. I don't know that I fully understood that until I watched Paprika. And again, it gave me something to aim for. Maybe this is really reductive, but I often go back to Kubrick. I think they're two completely separate filmmakers, but they both transcend medium and genre. And they both manage to create images and a story that make you feel multiple things at once. He is the illusionist of anime. He is a director who starts off by making you wonder what is real and what is not real, and by the end he may well think that it doesn't really matter. It's show time! That parade scene is the high point of the film. The most amazing moment. Both in terms of animation and drawing. ♪ Plant trees that grow dreams and money. ♪ The film Paprika is a culmination. It encapsulates all his major themes. The film explores metamorphosis, and the plasmaticity of animation. The art form's capacity to present changing forms that can move from one realm to another. Kon thus illustrates here the very origins of animation. It becomes the film's backbone, and breathes new life into the very idea. ♪ God and Buddha exchange religions. ♪ ♪ They entertain me in this floating world. ♪ ♪ They entertain me in this floating world. ♪ Am I... still dreaming? The parade is like an image from another world. It's like he was channeling truly another world. Again, I can't think of many films that have that kind of power. As we were doing the dubbing, we actors got the impression that the director was a very gentle man. Very polite and respectful. A real gentleman. He seemed very serene. Though his films might lead you to believe that he was half-crazy, he was absolutely charming, and very calm. But although he radiated gentleness, he was impenetrable. Someone a bit crazy who does crazy things is easy to understand and approach. But the fact that he was so calm, yet created such a delirious world, made us wonder. The more I saw him, the more mysterious he seemed. People who embody evil itself had no place in Kon's universe. He always had excuses for them, justifications. That's a testament to his kindness. Or to the generosity of people from Hokkaido. That was the feeling I got from his work. He was very soft-spoken, and very humble. But I could tell he was very confident in his ideas. He was definitely a filmmaker. That was inspiring to find out that he was conceiving it, drawing it, writing it. So many of all the different worlds were basically coming out of his imagination and the hard work. I remember kind of feeling empathy for how much work he had to do. There was gonna be a lot of pain and a lot of work to get his film done. A year before he died, we ran into each other at a party. He smiled at me. "Hey, Taro, we should go for a drink soon!" That surprised me, but also made me happy. Then he died. Several years later, there was a screening in Sapporo. I saw the film Tokyo Godfathers again. I discovered things I hadn't picked up on at the time. I realized he hadn't been ignoring me over financial problems. It was because I hadn't understood the very essence of his film. Rediscovering Tokyo Godfathers was an intense experience for me. I had really underestimated its power when it came out. That was a shock to me. It will be etched into my heart for all time. ON AUGUST 24, 2010, SATOSHI KON DIED OF CANCER AT THE AGE OF 46. THE NEXT DAY, HIS BLOG FEATURED A GOODBYE LETTER ENTITLED SAYONARA. MY GREATEST REGRET IS THE FILM DREAMING MACHINE. I'M WORRIED, NOT ONLY ABOUT THE FILM ITSELF, BUT ABOUT THE CREW I WORKED WITH. I'm already working on my next film. It's aimed at adults, as well as children. Paprika marked an end to my usual themes, the blurring of reality and fiction. He was really clear that this was a family film he was trying to make. On Earth there are no humans left, or creatures in general left. And what's left are machines, that were created by people to do the labor. Now that people have disappeared from Earth, these robots are still doing their jobs that they're programmed to do. Robin, Ririko and King are the main three characters. And they become friends. The situation is that electricity is running out. And obviously without electricity they cannot live. The tsunami is happening, and places that they can survive are starting to become limited. They know of a place called "The Land of Electricity" where there's an unlimited supply of electricity. So their goal is to get there. The whole story is seen through the eyes of Robin, a child, so it's easier to understand. Ririko arrives in the Garden of Eden, where Robin is living alone. So he uses a lot of symbolism. Ririko is the representation of Eve, of Adam and Eve. She gives Robin, the main character, his brain, because he's missing his head. Ririko is a robot type of the babysitter, or the nanny. So she's built and programmed to take care of children. That's why she looks the way she looks. She looks a bit like a Barbie or a cuddly toy. The whole design of the project had to be done by Kon. It's pure science fiction. I really would've loved to see the result. See what he'd have done with it. When you read the script of Dreaming Machine, there's quite scary stuff in it, and there's a lot of dark points in it, and there's a complexity in the narrative as well. When Satoshi Kon is working on one project, it's never about that film. He's actually thinking about the next film within that film. So, in Paprika, actually some parts you see are similar to Dreaming Machine. There's a graffiti on the wall, of the main 3 characters. There's actually a lot of hints about what's coming next. I got a call from Mr. Kon. I was surprised. He felt I wasn't working hard enough on Paprika. "Mr. Mima, I'm not seeing the hard work." He was preparing his next film and wondering whether to work with me. He was very direct. I figured I should be as direct as he was. So I told him I was quitting. I wouldn't work with him anymore. Mr. Kon demanded skills and expertise that were far beyond my capacities. For the first time, I waved a white flag, and we got into a fight. I told him I'd be the first to go see his film, but that I didn't want to be a part of the crew. I turned down his offer to work on Dreaming Machine. Mr. Kon died soon after that, and I was full of regret. That's the reason I agreed to be in this documentary. To say that I'm here today, thanks to Mr. Kon. His big goal for Dreaming Machine was that he wanted to aid training of young animators. So he wanted to give opportunities and he wanted to mentor these people. His loss isn't just the loss of a great director, a really unique creative. The anime industry lost somebody who's actually a representative and a really strong force of trying to improve the industry as a whole. So I think that was the major part of his loss as well. THANK YOU SINCERELY FOR ALL THESE BEAUTIFUL MEMORIES. I LOVED THE WORLD I LIVED IN. JUST THINKING ABOUT IT MAKES ME HAPPY. I'm convinced that Kon's films will be major references for all future directors of animated films. Even subconsciously, future artists will be under the influence of Satoshi Kon. The way people see animated cinema has evolved since he died, in Japan and throughout the world. I think he landed too soon in this industry. But thanks to that, he's an inspiration to many others. I would say this is one of the great filmmakers of the last 30 years. Someone who's contributed more to the well of innovation and inspiration than almost any filmmaker I can think of in the last 30 years. You're gonna have a very, very unique experience. Very, very unexpected. And you'll have a full human meal and a full human journey in any of his films. As much for his personality as for his films, he sought perfection at any price. How can I put this...? Not only with a perfect drawing, but with perfect direction. He couldn't forgive the slightest error or failure. Through his films, he was trying to resolve things he didn't understand, and share that with others. Few people are capable of transposing such deep questions to cinema with such virtuosity and illustrative talent. If someone tried to measure up, they would be nowhere near as good as him. Summing someone up in a word is difficult. Especially Satoshi Kon. I can't do it. He had two sides to him. He could be a nasty guy. A really nasty guy, okay? But I loved him. I can say that, because I love him. He had more than one face. Sometimes you had to be wary of him. But he was also endearing. You couldn't help but get attached. He will always be in our hearts.
