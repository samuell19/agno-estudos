I see the clouds they're rolling in They hide the sun but not my sin The Judas kiss still on my lips Can't walk away from where I've been Oh ohh Hear the calling Woah oh oh Hear the calling Walkin' on the water Darkness under my feet Gonna make the devil holler Hallelujah My name is Hazel King. Sometimes I look back on my past and it feels like it belongs to somebody else. But then it all comes flooding back. And the girl I left behind isn't really gone. She's just buried with him. And I know better than anyone.. Nothing stays buried forever. What will it be? What's in the tuna melt besides tuna? Cheese. Why don't you have garden burgers, Hazel? Because no one would order them, Rudy. Why won't you go out with me, Hazel? Because you're broke and unattractive, Willy. - Is the club sandwich on rye? - Nope. Well, I'd order the garden burger if you had them. - No, you wouldn't. - You're right. I wouldn't. I'm not unattractive once you get to know me. You're more unattractive once you get to know you. Ah, that's what my ex-wife said. Who do you think I heard it from? What's the soup of the day? Minestrone. Every day. How can you call it the soup of the day? I don't. You do. I call it the only soup we've got. How about garden meatloaf? Why don't you have that? Okay, you fellas have been coming in here two to three times a week since I opened the place. Every time it's the same thing. Willy wants to know why I won't go out with him even though you know you got a better chance of banging Carrie Underwood. And Carl wants to analyze the menu even though you knows it hasn't changed since the Bush administration. And Rudy wants to know why we don't serve healthy items even though you know you wouldn't order them if you had to. So, what'll it be? - Tuna melt. - Minestrone soup. Bacon cheeseburger. Fantastic. Javi. What, Diego hasn't showed up yet? No. Yo no soy dishwasher. Okay! - Anything else? - No, I'm good. Thank you. - Oh, stop. Get out of here. - Thanks. Mom, you can't afford to keep comping the cops. A little goodwill can make the difference between them showing up in five minutes or five hours. Is Travis going to order anything or is he just here keeping an eye on you? He's not like that. Okay. Um, did you check back on five? Steak and eggs. Moving like he's on death row. Alright. Well, you got more tables. Four's having coffee and two's sharing a donut. Listen, I need to ask you something. - You do? - Uh-hmm. Can't wait to hear that. Mom. I was wondering if I could get that college money. Oh, are you returning to college? Well, yeah. Someday. Maybe. Honey.. College money is for college. That's why they call it college money not hand-it-over-to-your tweaker-boyfriend so-he-can-blow-it-all-in- Vegas money. I'm wasn't going to give it to Travis. And what makes you think he's a tweaker? You're so evil. We want to get a place together. Over my dead worm-infested body. I'm 19. We love each other. Joy, his love will get you beat up or knocked up or dead broke or all three. You don't even know him. He's a good person. And he doesn't have insane ideas about who I am like I'm some sort of genius who could make it through pre-med. So, you're saying he swayed you with low expectations? Honey, come on, give yourself some credit, okay? You made it into a great school. Will you stop always trying to make me what you want? You don't know me. I don't even know who I am. You're my daughter. And who's my dad? Hmm. Are you ever going to tell me? 'Cause I've been trying to figure it out on my own but it must be some sort of state secret. Please keep your voice down. Forget the money. We'll figure it out. Anything to get out of here. My girls, too. At that age. Always in a mood. Why did you order 18 bucks of food if you had no money? - Another deadbeat. - Knock it off. Can't pay your check? I'm so sorry, um.. No. Lose it all in Vegas? I lost it all. Not in Vegas. Get that deputy back here. - Come here. - What? Don't judge. Unless you've lost everything, you can't know what it's like. He's robbing you and you're nice to him. Go help table seven. You know, I mean, she's not, she's not wrong to be angry. Well, I've never been a thief before. I just haven't eaten in a couple of days, so.. You got anything? A watch? Pocket change? No, nothing, nothing that you would want, no. Well, you're not from around here. No. LA. Did you come in off the bus? Yeah. Bus. What did you do in LA? Cardiothoracic surgeon. I'm not a dishwasher! Can you wash dishes? Job pays minimum, free meals. Your bathroom will be the men's room in the diner. There's a outdoor shower behind the kitchen. I promise not to peek. I'll take it. Thought you might. - Hazel King. - Elliot. Elliot Morgan. - Stop! - Hey, hey.. Ah, it gets colder here at night more than you might expect. I-I'll bring you some extra blankets and a towel and a bar of soap. She doesn't get it. I don't fit in at college or anywhere around here. The only place I fit in is next to you. You know somebody's gonna take that place out from under us if we don't rent it quick. That money is yours, Joy. You better come up with a way to get it. Come here. Alright, I gotta go. - Get outta here. - See you soon. See ya. Some homeless guy eats your food and can't pay for it so you give him a job and a place to sleep. Are you running a diner or a shelter? I don't think he's homeless, baby. I think he's just lost. He could be a serial killer for all you know. We probably won't wake up tomorrow. We can't keep going through dishwashers like paper plates. If I give him a place to sleep, he's more likely to stay. - I don't understand you. - Oh, get in line. You've known Travis for two years. He's the man that I want to marry but you wouldn't piss on him if he was on fire. You've known this deadbeat drifter a couple of hours and answer his prayers. I know people, Joy. And hopefully someday you will, too. Leave those. Give me your feet. - Really? Oh, my God! - Uh-hmm. I was so hoping for this, but I was too scared to ask. Ahh! - About my college money.. - Ah! Joy, not again... I'm not asking for you to give it to me. But maybe I could borrow some? - Nice try, but no. - I'll pay it back. I said no. And I assume my continuing to remind you that Travis will bring nothing but misery will only drive you closer to him. Definitely. Great. Hey, I need you at breakfast. It's gonna be a busy day. - Love you, too. - Joy, 6:00 a.m! I tried. Even said I'd pay her back. She's hanging onto her fantasy that I'm gonna be the world's greatest doctor. Maybe your family could... I'm not taking anything from them. - They've got the money. - Yeah. And they'd make me pay for it the rest of my life. Okay, so.. If we got married right away it could be mom's wedding present. But Joy no love Travis. A thing. Did you just say when your cousin dated a chicken? He dressed it up. Took it to restaurantes. It was a thing. What, like, a chicken? - T-the bird? - Si. How is your cousin dating a chicken similar to Joy dating Travis? It really pissed off his mama. - Uh-hmm? - Yeah. A chicken? - You up? - Yeah. We're gonna need all hands on deck. Everybody's going in to Vegas for the fight. Let's go. I'll be right.. There. I'll have the club sandwich. No, wait. Scratch that. What kind of cheese on that club sandwich? American. Why don't you have soy cheese, Hazel? Because it tastes like bubble wrap, Rudy. How would you feel about going line dancing with me, Hazel? Like a torture victim, Willy. What's the soup of the day? - Manhattan clam chowder. - Really? No. Minestrone. Every day. Which we've been over. With the fat-free beans? Yeah, sure. Diet beans. - Diet beans? - Diet beans. Hey, I'm getting the hang of this. We're falling behind out there. Just go bus some tables, alright. You, you want me to finish? Let it go. Go! Now, go. You're late. We went to the races in Laughlin. You could have called. I'm not a child, mother. No, you're an adult and adults have consideration. That's part of what makes them adults. Why are you hiding the side of your face from me? - I'm not. - Yes, you are. No, I'm not. - That piece of shit. - It was an accident. Javier, you're in charge. Mom, don't hurt him. His family's dangerous. - Que pasa? - Su boyfriend. Bad news. 'Judge Janice? Total screamer.' Dude. She's like, eighty. Moaner. No, dude, screamer. I can always tell. Yeah, like hell you can. Hey, who's that? Man, just keep your mouth shut. I'll handle this. Hey, Travis. Can I have a word? Mm.. I'm busy. - Won't take long. - What is it? Can we talk in my car? 'Why can't we talk right here?' 'Cause I'd like to speak in private. Well, what you say to me, you can say to old Conrad back there. - Damn straight. - Alright. I came here to tell you that you're a walking argument for birth control and you don't have the balls or the brains that God gave a field mouse. And if you ever go near my daughter again I will kill you and your entire inbred family. - Are you done? - Not even warmed up. Well, Conrad here and me was just wondering if just by looking at a woman you can tell if she's a screamer a moaner, or she lies there like she's dead. 'Now, I'm of the opinion that a-a fine looking cougar' such as yourself has gotta be a world champion moaner even though I-I personally, have never been all up in your business to find out. 'Can't say I haven't thought about that, Hazel.' So, what is it, cougar mama? Are you a screamer? A moaner? Or you dead? What the hell? - Get up! - You're dead! - Get up. - Bite me, bitch. Don't hurt. Alright, alright! Get up. You broke my nose, you bitch. - Yeah, I'm just getting st... - I'm calling the cops! And that will be the last thing you ever do. - Turn. - Oh.. - Oh, my God! - Don't move! Hazel, please just let me go. - Get in the car. - What? No, no way. Get in the car or I will shoot you in the face. No, my nose. 'Wait. Hazel, Hazel, I didn't mean to.' Now, be still. Come on, sunshine. There you go. You're alright. There you go. What is that? Yeah. I know. I know, I know what you must be thinking. What a bizzare coincidence that a grave dug to the exact dimensions of my body is out here in the middle of the desert where nobody will ever find me. No coincidence. I dug this hole the first day we met. Because I knew this day would happen. I knew you would hurt my daughter and I knew that I would then have to kill you. You know, people think it's easy digging a grave in the desert but I'm here to tell you that's bullshit. This took me two days. There's nothing that a mother wouldn't do to protect her child from harm. And you... are harm. Seems like a, a shame to waste such a hard dug grave on your bitch ass, but.. I can't have two days digging for naught. So, here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna find out.. If you're a screamer a moaner... or dead. Argh! Please! Please! Wrong answer. It was an accident. I swear! Please, please, please, you don't want to do this. The hell I do. 'That's right, baby girl. We're free.' 'We're finally free.' - Tu mama? - Si. I'll help you find your Familia. Gracias. I want to know what happened, mom. Travis and I exercised a robust exchange of ideas. And? And he's leaving the state immediately and will never go near you again. No way. Struck me as firmly swayed. Give me the keys to the Bronco. No. You're working. Or you're supposed to be. I have to find Travis. No, you have to bus your tables. Mom, what happened? Travis said that he thought it would be best if he left California entirely. You know who his family is, right? They're criminals, like, violent criminals. So be happy they're not your in-laws now. They're gonna want payback. Joy, I am not afraid of these people. And I'm gonna do whatever I have to do to protect you. Then I'm going someplace where you can't protect me. - That's your prerogative. - Yeah. - You're damn right it is. - Language. Volume. Did you even think for a microsecond how kicking Travis out of the state would make me feel? I don't want that. - What is our mantra? - Ouch. Say it. "He raises a hand, I raise a fist. He raises a fist, I raise a gun." Words to live by, baby. Yeah. You get the gold star for parenting. Joy, it's my job to teach you how this world really is. Like your mom did? My childhood is my childhood which will never be your childhood. I love Travis. You don't know jack squat about love. That's funny coming from you. Knowing that you've never loved anyone in your entire life. I love you, Joy, more than you'll ever know. That's not what I mean and you know it. Everything good here? Great. Hey. You know that guy? Nope. No, I don't. It's my hobby. I, I love old diners. Can I get you anything else? No. Just the coffee. Thanks. Hi. Hey. - You alright? - Yeah. Fresh air... bad dream. - You wanna talk about it? - No. Not really. Goodnight. 'Hang on a sec.' Umm.. Joy seems to think that you're some homeless killer. Well, we all have our secrets. Yeah, well, if yours come knocking on my diner door like that guy taking pictures... Hey, I told you, I don't know him. Good. Make you a deal.. You tell me your secrets.. I'll tell you mine. Oh, that's a deal you don't want to make. Look, I worked my ass off to build this place. I can't have trouble. You are not gonna get it. Not from me. - Okay. - Goodnight. Goodnight. Who are you, what were you doing in my diner this morning? Freelance reporter, taking pictures of your dishwasher, lady. - Why? - He killed his girlfriend. Check the computer. 'Drunk driving accident in LA, 2016.' He did four years for manslaughter. Well, how is this news now? Because before he crashed that car... your dishwasher.. Was a famous heart surgeon. If I catch you in my diner again I'll use your nuts for chilli. - Hang on, Javier. Hold on. - Rapidisimo. Gracias. Hey, the other day, you had a girl in your van. - Who's that? - Que? The girl in your van? - My cousin. She's shy. - Bring her in next time. You want to keep having this conversation or help me cook? Got dishes. I'll have the patty melt. No, wait. Scratch that. That. How big is the patty in the patty melt? - Quarter pound. Butter. - Cooked in vegetable oil? I'm going to the drag races this Saturday. That sounds life changing. Haze, could you do a kale salad? Can you do an Irish jig? What's the soup of the day? What I'm really thinking is how I can ever get you to go out with me. I'm not yanking your chain, Hazie. I'm serious. You might be surprised how good we get along. I'm not talking permanent, just... company now and then. Get a dog, Willy. She didn't say no. Here. He knew it was wrong, you know. Right away, he apologized. Yeah, they do that. Doesn't mean it won't happen again. Mom, he's good. He's so good. You'd know if you'd just let yourself see it. I'm sorry, baby, but good doesn't do that to somebody they love. I gotta get out of here. Yeah, okay, you can clock out. I wish I could clock out of my life. Hey, don't talk like that. Joy. Joy. Leave me alone. - Phil. - Well, hello, Hazel. Long time. I'd say about 20 years. How you been? - Surviving. - Von's out. How? One of the counts got reversed. Okay, when? Tomorrow night, 9:00 p.m., same place. - I'll be there. - Oh, I know you will. Oh, isn't that Joy, huh? She's a beautiful young lady. You did real good there. See you soon. - Hey. - Hey. - Did you eat? - Yes. Javier left some fried chicken for me. It was very good. Very good. Yeah, he's the best. Is Joy still upset? For now. Wel, it's hard to let go of someone you love. Speaking from personal experience? What are you guys talking about? I'll let you ladies have your evening. - Goodnight. Goodnight, Joy. - Night. Loser. Feeling a little better? Trying not to feel anything at all. Okay, let's get something straight. I'm allowing you to sulk. Allowing me? I don't need your permission. Joy, you've had a shock. But what's happened has happened. And the best way to get over it is to plan for a better future. Because trust me, little girl I want you to get out of this town even more than you do. Oh, after keeping me in a cage my entire life? Yes, I made you study. You made me the weird girl that nobody wanted to talk to. - Except for Travis. - Oh, God! Well, I'm not going anywhere until I figure out what happened to Travis. Poof! He disappears! And he just leaves his truck and his business? And he doesn't call me, or his family, or any of his friends? You know, the only possibility that makes sense.. Is what, Joy? What? Did you hurt him? You don't actually believe that I can hurt someone, do you? No. And for the record, I would do whatever I needed to to protect you, but I give you my word, when I left Travis he was very much alive and leaving California. - I believe you. - Thank you. And I don't believe you. I think he might be dead, mom. Baby, he's not worth this. Joy? W-where are you going? 'Joy? Joy?' Put it all on the line Put it all on the line They see me.. - Hey. - Thanks for texting me. I needed to get out. - What happened to your eye? - I fell. If you say so. So have you talked to his family yet? They hate me. Racist douchebags. I wonder if they'll make a missing persons report. They don't want the cops getting involved with their shit. Travis's dad is doing time. So? They've all got records. Well, we were gonna break away from all that. You know, get our own place, make a new start.. God, I-I can't stop obsessing. This is it, right here. Get in on this. Yeah. Oh, shit. Cops, let's go! Let's go! Oh, shit! Hey, Joy. Let's go. I'm here to take you home. Let's go. - I owe you one, Luis. - Oh, don't mention it. That was the most excitement I've seen on a night tour since, um.. Well, long time. Uh, griddle's gonna be ready in about 30 if you want breakfast. Actually, my partner and I really need to get back. You know, paperwork. Plus, my wife will have breakfast waiting for me, so. Thanks again. Again? Where's yours? I-I have no time. I have to Casa. I'll see you tomorrow, I have to go Casa. - Okay, adios. - 'Hey, see you, Javier.' Hey, boss. Mind if I join you? Yeah, sure. So it's a hell of a day today to be on our on the floor all by yourself. Are you okay? No, actually, I could use a quadruple bypass. Do you know of any good heart surgeons? I've been Googled. You know that guy that was here the other day? The one taking pictures? The one you said you didn't know? Yeah. He's a reporter. And h-how do you know that? I paid him a visit. What do you mean you paid him a visit? You do know him. Yeah. Yeah, his father was a patient of mine and he died on my table and.. Walter blamed me for it. Like a dog and a bone he just keeps draggin' my name through the mud and.. Well, you know, eventually I'm going to get my medical license reinstated. The Medical Board is gonna have a issue with this so.. Well, I had a conversation with him. I might have persuaded him not to run it. You know the thing he never got right is that they, they painted me as this rash, arrogant.. Vain surgeon with a shiny career. A fancy car, a beautiful fiance, but what they never get right.. When I asked her to marry me, she said yes. Her love, it changed my life. And I was so happy. And then in an instant, I just... boom. I lost everything. I'm sorry, Hazel. It's, I didn't mean to just take it out.. Dark road of my life, so thank you for listening. - It's like doing me a favor. - Sure. I could actually use a favor myself. Yeah. Anything. I have to go to Vegas tonight. For fun times? No. I'm from there. It's never fun. - Uh, Joy.. - Yeah. If she does anything or if anybody shows up that you think I need to know about, will you please reach out? Yeah. Absolutely. I should be back by breakfast. Are you sure? You don't sound sure. I'm sure. I can never get out of Vegas fast enough. Thanks. Heard you were coming, but I didn't believe it. Last time I saw you, you were in high school. You were a lot smaller. Yeah. I believe I was, yeah. Uh, arms out for me. Thanks. Alright. I told my baby sugar.. Right on time as always. Well, well, well. My little girl Hazel. Welcome home. It warms my heart like a microwave to see you. It's poppin' corn right now. Congratulations on your release. Who knew the world had little luck left in it? Sit. - You want a drink? - Uh, no, thanks. No, no, no, no. You want some of my good bourbon. To celebrate our reunion. Did I ever tell you where I found this little gemstone, Phil? Remind me. Squatting in an alley downtown. Hooked on smack. 'Servicing salesman behind the El Cortez' for ten bucks a pop. What were you, 16? Fifteen. But I saw something in her, same as now, no fear. None. A pure predator. So I brought her home, cleaned her up. Trained her for what she was born to do. Man, did she prove me right. Hey, Phil, where's the burbon, huh? My girl. All those years... you never came to visit me? Couldn't stand seeing you in a cage. - Thanks for caring. - What do you want, Von? Our work continues. Perry Gamble is in town. I need him... met. You must know a dozen other contractors... I've never known a contracting artist like you. And there's no one else who can get closer to Perry. I'm retired. I'm... rusty as hell. I got a bad back, bum feet. Advance up front, per usual. I can't do it. I'm sorry. I, I know I owe you big time. But I-I-I can't do it. I won't. You're worried about Joy. 'A mother's instinct.' 'Her boyfriend's disappeared, she's..' '...emotionally unstable.' 'God forbid she does anything reckless.' That would be a tragedy. I can never say no to you. Perry's got a suite at the Ibis, he's only in town a few nights so you have to move fast. I don't have to tell you there's no room for failure. And when have I ever failed you? Good girl. No. If I was that, I'd be no use to you. Mr. Chen? Perry Gamble. Thank you for coming. 'Uh, let's talk in my suite, alright?' Hello? Turn those off. Thought you were a burglar. It's the only place where there's no drama. Join me? Yeah. So... you made it home. Safe, sound. Fun times. Have some. It's, uh, good stuff. That.. That is the first alcohol I've had since the accident. Oh, God. I'm so sorry. No. No. I, um.. I've wanted to experience as much... guilt and grief and self-loathing as possible without anything to take the edge off. See, I'm some sort of a-a champion at numbing my feelings. In med school, it was lithium. No shit. For depression and anxiety. I was a heroin addict. - Jesus. When? - 'Uh-huh.' Fourteen, fifteen. No shit. I just wanted to escape. Felt trapped. Story of my life, really. Always wanting to escape, but just ending up trapped. I guess that's sort of what Joy is feeling, huh. Well, that.. Is a feeling that I do not want her to have. That feeling can make a girl do horrible things. Like what, Hazel? Well, let's just say that I've... secured the presidential suite in hell. Actually, I would say that the only good thing I've ever done is raise Joy. Yeah. You got sober. Yeah. How, how'd you do that? A benevolent master. Only that ended up being a trap, too. There was a time that, that I felt free where I was raising Joy, and starting the business, and.. And the monsters were the ones that were locked up. And you, how do you feel now? It's okay, you know, the secrets you tell in the dark.. They don't count in the daylight. Goodnight, Hazel. I knew you were in here. Oh, I forgot. - I gotta grab this. Alright. - Okay. Well.. You promised not to peek. That was before last night. Yeah. How'd you sleep? - Not long enough. - Yeah. Yeah, me neither. - Last night... - Was awesome. Yes, it was. Umm... it was a first for me. First time havin' sex in your diner or first time havin' sex with one of your dishwashers? One of those. How about you let me blow my first paycheck... on you. Take you out, proper dinner? Um, I can't. I have to go to Vegas again. Okay, well, another night, then. Yeah, yeah, we'll see. - Mom. - What? - Customers are coming in. - Okay. I'm gonna.. I-I'll see you in a second. Yeah. Oh baby then the girl puts the silkiest piece of otoro on my tongue. I swear to God, the best I had in my life. - Whoa! - Watch it. Oh, my God. - Hazel? - Perry Gamble. Damn, woman. What's it been? A dog's age. Ooh... damn. Still fine. Still mine? You held up pretty fine yourself. Girl, we gotta hang. I-I-I got a suite upstairs. A-a view of the Strip.. Um, no, I, I can't. I'm-I'm waiting for everyone. It's, it's girls night out. Nah, we got us some serious catching up to do. Baby. Okay. Yeah, yeah, we do. Yeah, we do. - Come on. - Okay. - Damn, you look good. - Thank you. And then when you karate chopped that kid in the throat. Stop. You're not supposed to remember that. You know what? Enough with.. How is business? Umm, a whole new world. - Yeah? - Yeah. I'm almost completely legit. You? Legitimate? - It's true. - Really? On the inside, I developed relationships with people who know people who have cash they need to park somewhere. Substantial cash. So... you're washing money? Investing money. Vegas is growing again. Stadiums, tech hubs, arts complexes. 'Growth needs cash.' And that's where I come in. I am sort of a... matchmaker. Sounds legit. You and me. Runnin' and gunnin'. Best times of my life. Yeah, I know what you mean. Why did you leave? What? That night. Our last night. All those years ago. You just took off. And I never heard from you again. Until tonight. I just had to change things. Everything. Yeah, I guess I can relate to that. But still.. We shared a lot, you and me. Yeah. You can say that again. I've never had anything like that since. Me neither. Then why did you leave? I mean, really? Perry, I knew if I stayed, I wouldn't live to see 30. I loved you, Hazel. I loved you too. Ever since then I've been trying to find that kind of connection again but I never have. Me neither. To us. To us. I'm busy! I'm sorry. If he-if he knocks a second time... Yeah, go. Sorry, boss. Mr. Chen, he wants you to join him. 'And he's insisting.' Uh, tell him I'll be right there. Um, my, uh, biggest Chinese investor... It's, it's fine. Go, do what you need to do. Not gonna run away? No. I'll be here. I'll be back. Okay. 'Let's go.' How's the storage shed, Elliot? It's comfy, Joy. Thanks. Bet that's not the worst place you ever slept. You'd win that bet. 'What's at the bottom of Elliot's list of crash pads?' Prison. Mom, did you know that he's been to prison? Yes. Can we drop it, please? What crime? Vehicular manslaughter. Told you he could have killed someone. It was an accident. A drunken accident? Yes, Joy. I was drunk at the time of the accident and at the death of my then fiancee. Well.. I'm sorry that that happened. Thanks. I was a husky. U Dub. I went there. - Really? - Med school. Right. Elliot was a cardiothoracic surgeon in LA. Prior to aforementioned accident. Our dishwasher is a heart surgeon? Bet you didn't see that coming, did ya? 'Joy was pre-med at U Dub.' For the eight months that she was there. What happened? Why'd you leave? College is a joke. - College is a racket. - Exactly! Well, see, what you gotta do is you gotta figure out that they're playing you, and then you have to play them. Now, if you want, I can teach you how to game the entire pre-med curriculum 'cause once you learn that.. Then college is a breeze. Okay. What made you want to be a doctor? Um, I've always been broken. And I thought that if I could fix other people that I might be able to fix myself. Did that ever work? Yeah. For fleeting moments. I guess it did. What about you? Why do you wanna be a doctor? I want my life to matter. What matters more than saving lives? That's right. When you're right, you're right. Hey, Phil, you remember me telling you about a punk on the inside, begged me for protection? Remind me. He was so scared he'd vomit just thinking about the showers. - Then he came to me. - You gave the word. - Nobody touched him. - Not a finger. What do you think would've happened without my protection? Nothing good. Right. Nothing good. All that stuff could still happen. And worse. I saved her goddamn life. She would've died in that alley if not for me. And now, when I need her and what, she's goes straight? I put you in there for a reason. - My reason. You understand? - I understand. Yup. I can't control her. You-you have to understand that. Don't you tell me what I have to understand. - All I can do is... - Just shut up! Time's running out. I need to know everything she does before she does it. Everything. - You will. - Get him out of here, Phil. Can I ask about something you don't like to talk about? Sure. Are you in money trouble? - What makes you ask? - These trips to Vegas. No, uh, honey, that's just business. What kind of business? Old business. It's nothing to worry about. You know, I do worry. Even though I'll hate you until the day I die. And I was thinking.. If you need the college money... What, no. I don't.. It's-it's just an old debt that I gotta pay back. - That's all. - Thought so. It was either money or a new man. And must be money. Seeing how you and Elliot are such happy little bang buddies. Young lady.. Don't even. It's so obvious. How? Well, for one thing you can't keep your eyes off his ass. - It is a great ass. - It is. - Joy. - It is. But it's not like you to mix work with pleasure. That can get messy. And you hate clutter. 'It's not messy yet.' Have you given any thought to what he said about you going back to school? Well, it's not like there's anything keeping me here. So, is that a yes? Don't get your hopes up. I just haven't ruled it out yet. - I'll see you in there. - See you. It's too late I'm sorry.. He made his mole today. Oh, then you know what I'm having. Hey, Hazel, how many people coming through here every day would you say you know personally? Well, probably half, maybe a little more. Why? We're getting multiple reports of young girls gone missing. You know, coyotes bringin' them over to join their families in the area, and the girls never showin' up. - What do think's going on? - I don't know. Could be a lot of things. None of them good. Yeah, hang on. Javier! missing girls? It's very sad. They need to be protected. If you see anything suspicious... Yeah. I've got your number. Thanks. Thanks for waiting. Something to drink? Wow. Well, lunch just got a whole lot prettier, Joy. You were here the other day. You know my mom. We go way back. - Way back to what? - I got this. - Four needs a check. - Introduce me to your friend. And two needs to be cleared. - Nice meeting you. - Yeah. I assume you have a message for me. Von wants me to remind you that Perry leaves town tomorrow morning. Well, you can remind him that I've never failed to do a job. Ever. He'll be glad to hear that. Joy seems to be doing a lot better. Joy is none of your business. Oh, well, you see that's where you're wrong. Joy is very much my business until the job gets done. Clock's ticking, Hazel. Hey, Joy. This is for you. Nice to meet you. What did that guy want? Nothing. Just some jerk from high school. Hey. Hazel. - Hey. Can I help? - What? What do you want? - Can I help? - No. You can't. Alright. Do you wanna talk about it? No, I don't. Just need to think. I just need to think. I'm not your enemy, you know that, right? Well, I don't know that you're my friend. In fact, I don't know you at all. Well, actually, you know a lot more about me than I know about you. Well, I can't help that. I'm not as notorious. Whatever that guy said to you inside, don't take it out on me. I warned you I'm not always so nice. Yeah, well, you weren't kidding. Okay. - You wanna know about me? - Yeah. I am cold. I am calculating. I never drop a grudge. And I always have an exit plan. And everything that I care about is in there. Joy. Javier. The people that I see everyday. This place that I made here. And I have to protect the people that I love. - Okay. - Okay! Okay. Hmm. I have to go to Vegas. - Again? - Yes, again. And with.. Any luck, it'll be the last time. - Look at me. - Hmm? Hazel, look at me. - Look at me. - What? I'm not goin' anywhere. I'm right here. It'll be okay. 'Where you going?' Ye-yeah. Hey. Can't sleep? Wow. You look, you look hot. Uh, I can't. I have to leave now. This late? Why are you goin' now? Well, the guy that I work for sometimes keeps odd hours. So.. Listen, Joy's really thinkin' about going back to school and, and I wanted to thank you for that. Yeah. Don't go. Don't go. Whatever you think you have to do.. Don't! Don't do that. I-I can't. I don't, I don't have a choice. Um.. And this, this is, it's very sweet but it's not happening again. It's good. And it's messy. And I can't have clutter. Okay. You're the boss. Exactly. Hey. Yup. She's on the way. Yeah. - Bellman brought this up. - Ah, okay. Alright, thanks. - You can't stop me! Get away. - Ma'am. Ma'am. 'But boss doesn't want to be disturbed.' I'm his wife. Baby. - Think you could surprise me? - Who snitched? Nobody can keep secrets from the boss. You really set this up for me? Baby. Baby. Baby, baby. It's all for you. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. He said he wanted to see me. - Alright. You know the drill. - Yeah. What the hell Hazel? Hazel, really? Help me get a bourbon, Philly. Ah.. It's Hazel. - Check it out. - I got it. Hazel, what are you doing? Come on, honey. We can work this out, huh? After all we've been through, it can't come down to this. You're my girl, right? I'm finally gonna be free of you. We're a good team. A great team. Don't let your.. Don't let your emotions take you down the wrong path. This is the right path. It's the only path. You need me, Hazel. You'd be dead a long time ago without me. And I'm the only one that's gonna be there when you slide back into the shit. And you know you will. You think Joy's gonna stick around? - Or Elliot? - You think this is funny? Elliot works for me. If you don't believe me, you can ask him. I own him like I own you. You don't own me. This is for mom. And this is for Joy. And this is for me. I saved your life. The only good thing that came out of what you made me is that I can do this and still live with myself. Dad. Hey. Morning. Javier, how much do I have to pay you before you get a new van? That one runs bien. How long you've been working for me? Sixteen, no, seventeen years. - Yeah. - Since my youngest was five. Since Joy was two. I'm gonna buy you a new set of tires. - No, no, no, no, no. - Yeah. - For your loyalty. - You don't have to. After all, if we don't have loyalty, then what do we have? Honey, you don't have to do breakfast. I got it. Oh, that's okay. You had a long night and everything. - How did it go? - Good. - What about that debt? - Paid in full. - Get any sleep? - No. Will you ever tell me about it someday? Sure. - No, you won't. - No. - I love you, baby. - I love you too, mom. 'Psst.' Shh. - Hey, Mom. - What? Yeah. - Can I borrow the Broncho? - Now? Some friends want me to come over. I won't be long. What about break.. I'll have the Denver omelet. No, wait. Scratch that. Now, on the Denver omelet can I substitute the ham for wheat germ? If you hate yourself. How'd you like to go to a John Denver concert with me, Hazel? - I'd like that, Willy. - Really? - Because John Denver's dead. - Oh. Right. Was the Denver omelet invented in Denver? - Phoenix. - Get outta here. Uh-huh, in 1862, Union General Wade Jefferson Denver created the, "Denver Omelet" in Phoenix, Arizona. - Well, I'll be damned. - I made that up. Why would you do that? To spice up the day. I don't know. How about a Kenny Rogers concert? Also dead. Of course. What's wrong with me? Can you do an egg white omelet, Hazel? I could, Rudy, but I choose not to. - Toby Keith's alive. - His music sucks. I don't even know what I want. - Me, neither. - Me, neither. Okay. For the first time ever, we're going to introduce breakfast roulette! That's where I choose your meal at random and you accept the result without complaint. Okay? Okay. Willy. Sausage scramble. Rudy. Blueberry pancakes. Last but not least, Carl. Bacon and egg sandwich. No substitutions. That'll work. Sure, yeah. Sounds good. - Where's Javier? - He went out back a while ago. You and I are gonna need to talk at some point today. Okay. Jav? Jav. Javie. Are you okay? Get the girl. Hazel! Hey! Hey. Okay. That's okay. You're okay. You're okay. Alright. Okay, I got you. Okay.. You're gonna have to trust me. Okay? No, no, no. Okay. Yeah. You're gonna have to trust me. Put pressure here. I'm gonna put pressure here. I got you. I got you. Alright? Stay with me. Right here, look at me. Yeah. Look at me. Look at me. Hear the calling
