It came through the roof? Yes, it scared us to death. Had long glowing knives instead of hands. - Do you think it was a ghost? - Or a demon or something. Do you hear voices when you're possessed? Yep. It's been about two years now. We're waiting for you for the big sale out on Route-- You didn't see it. I seen it with my own eyes. - It came out of the trees. - Cats don't do that. - Any biologist will tell you that. - My two calves was dead the next day. - Explain that, Mr. Scientist. - Somebody's pulling a prank. I'm a good person. I don't deserve to go to hell. Hey, Julie. Hi. I don't know where I am. I passed the town sign, there's no town. Wait, I think I found it. Well, I wanted a small town. I got it. People are staring like I'm from another planet. I'll call you when I'm settled in, okay? Julie? I'm losing you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Waiting for the parade? - Sorry, I can't hear. You see, there's-- The sign says ''stop.'' It don't mean stay. Right. I'm sorry. - Uh-huh. - Thanks, officer. Oh, give me a break. - What did I do? - See the-- A sudden turn like that's a great way to get sideswiped. All right. Sorry. You travelling, Miss Stillman? Dr. Stillman, the school district's new therapist. There been a shooting at the school or--? Who said kids around here need a headshrinker? Most school districts have a therapist on staff these days. My taillights, brake lights and signal work. Oil might be a bit low... ...but l'm meeting with the elementary school principal. - If you want to ticket me-- - No ticket. Here's the thing, I'm just trying to keep a small town safe. Right. I'll stay out of trouble. Is he still on the phone? Hey, there. Hey. Ed Turner. - Dr. Stillman. - Sure. Sorry to keep you waiting... ...but I guess we don't much run on New York time out here. - I think your clock has stopped. - Say again? Well, what do you know about that? Whoa, hey! Careful feet, boys. Careful feet. Golly, I would love to have half of that energy, wouldn't you? So, Dr. Stillman, what exactly do you plan on... -...doing with the kids? -How do I work? What kind of techniques or therapies--? Do you have them draw pictures or tell stories? -lt depends. Sometimes I use-- -Do you use the puppets? -Whatever they're comfortable with. -Are they anatomically correct? -The puppets? -Yeah. I don't think puppets should be anatomically correct. I don't think peenies and woobies belong on dolls. The dolls emulate the children. Unless '' peenies and woobies''-- Okay, that's enough of that. That's enough of that. -Show me my office? -Sure. You're gonna be sharing an office with Della, Nurse Divelbuss. Bet your mother killed herself because you're such a freak. The little bitch-ass punched me. -Okay, enough. Enough! -He punched me. Dude, I didn't even see him do it. Don't you give me that look, mister. Time-out for you again. -Good luck. -Thank you. Charlie Hickocks to Principal Turner's office. Hello? Come on, sit your can down. Brings it on himself for being strange. Didn't I say to stop looking at me? Huh? And put that garbage down when l'm talking to you. You are gonna be the death of me yet. -Who are you? -Dr. Stillman. -That room's private. -You talk to kids like this? -He bloodied a boy's nose today. -I don't care. - I'd like time alone with him. - This is my office-- This is my office too. Thank you. Can I get a break here? Let's trade. l'll give you the comic book back for your name. Okay? So who are you? Benjamin James McCann. Benjamin. Do you like '' Ben''? I'm Dr. Stillman. I saw you outside on the crosswalk. Did you see me? So you like comics? My favourite are Twisted Tales and early issues of Alien World. You read number six, The Invasion Begins? -I love how in the end-- -No! -I want to find out for myself. -All right. So it's aliens for you? No skateboards or dinosaurs? Dinosaurs are aliens. Aliens brought them here. They couldn't survive in this ecosystem and went extinct. Who told you that? -Why'd you hit that kid? -I didn't hit him. Well, he beat you up pretty bad. What happened? Want me to call your mom? Okay, l'll call your dad. Hey, you're not strange, okay? No matter what that nurse with the big butt says. Tell her I said that, I'll tell you how issue six ends. The Christmas program will be held.... All choir members make your morning rehearsal. Did you at least win this time? You okay? You feel sleepy? -You have headaches? Follow my hand. -Dad, l'm fine. I checked his pupils. He's okay. Dr. Stillman. The new district therapist. I called you. I'm Dr. McCann. Michael. I'm the town doctor. -Nice to meet you. -Well, I better get this one home. Thanks for calling. - You're welcome. - Dad, she likes comics too. I never knew a girl who liked Alien World. Could I have a word with you? -Were you talking to him? -Yeah. -Well, why? -He was in a fight. I just asked him some basic background questions. -Like what? -Like about his mother. -Did he tell you about her? -No. -He reacted when I mentioned her. -Right. Well, she's gone. She died five years ago, in an accident. Ben's all I have and l'm all he has. I know what my son needs. -He needs the past to stay the past. -You're a doctor. You should know that if you bury the past, it'll rear its ugly head. Whatever. I just don't want my son in therapy, okay? I'm sorry. We close at 9. Well, what can I get in 1 5 minutes? -A burger. -A burger's fine. Can I get a cappuccino? -Please tell me you have cappuccino. -Of course we do. -You think you're in Hicksville? -No. Coffee's fine. Thanks. I was a judge for 35 years. I'm retired now. But I still run two miles every day. And I hardly sweat at all. Thanks. I heard the McCann boy gave the Bertz boy a bloody nose. News travels fast. I heard the Bertz boy had it coming. Dr. McCann took his boy out of school. -That man is a saint in my book. -Why is he a saint? -Adopting the boy after his mom died-- -All right! Jesus Christ, Judge. Let the gal finish her burger so we can close up. Macaroni and cheese: the dinner for real men who can't cook. Is this safe to eat? We should talk about what happened today, huh? -You said you'd be different this year. -I am different. - It's just the other kids-- - I'm not accusing you of anything. I don't want anyone to get hurt. Oh, what's this? What is this? - Look what I found! - Issue five. The prequel. I can find out what happened before the invasion. -Can I be excused? -Homework first, and then aliens. -Hey, Ken. -Hey, how you doing? Storm tonight. I heard Ben had a little trouble in school. Della said the new headshrinker just spent some time with him. Yeah. Yeah, a little. So he-- I mean, how'd that go? Well, you know Ben. He doesn't really talk a lot. I wouldn't worry about it. Okay, well, I was just curious. She's pretty, ain't she? Dr. Stillman. Yeah, she is. There's nothing to worry about. There's the weir do. What's up? Thanks for the chips. Doofus. Want to tell me something about your mom? Anything? I don't remember her. - Let's talk about your dad. - Everybody knows l'm adopted. Does it make you feel different from others? -That's not why l'm different. -Why are you different? I can't tell you. I have something for you. See, it's blank, so you get to tell the story. What's he thinking? What's she feeling? -I know what you're doing. -What? How am I supposed to remember her? I was four. Kids remember things when they're two or three. Parties and vacations. We like to forget bad things. Was life with your mom bad? Then you do remember. Something good, something happy, anything. Anything. Ben, stop! I'm sorry. You forgot this. I want to help. Trust me. -Everyone says that. -What? - I don't remember. - You could if you tried. Let me help. Look, no one will know what you say to me. I swear. Talk to me! People say mean things, huh? But you know what? They're gonna be surprised. Because one day, Daddy's gonna come back. He's gonna land his huge spaceship... ...and take us home. Remember. We're not from around here. Mommy? Mommy! - I told you, no therapy. - I'm sorry. - You've no idea what you've done. - What l've done? What happened to Ben when his mom died? - Who was Ben's father? - We don't know. - Maggie Miller wasn't from here. - She fucked anything that moved. The thing is, you really shouldn't be out here all by yourself. Forty-eight hours ago, a great cone-shaped object was discovered. Where did this massive artifact come from? Could it be from another planet or even another galaxy? All we can say is that it was not made by human hands. The discovery coincides with the slaying... ... of several of the town's citizens. I made us some popcorn. Way too much popcorn. What is this? One report cited the appearance of a figure in the woods. Alien movie? Is that the alien? - I'm sorry. -I have a feeling of doom. There are two forms of life fighting for survival here. Only one of them can win. It's got to be us. You're right, kid. Hey, buddy, I want you to know that whatever happened today... ...I promise you it's not gonna happen again, okay? I mean that. Dr. McCann. Yeah, Bob. Calm down. Is she vomiting? What's her temperature? Okay, l'll be right over. All right, just stay calm. -Do you have to go? -You know there's nobody else. - I want to go with you. - I'm sorry, buddy, you can't do that. Look, why don't you watch your movie... ...dig into that popcorn, and before you know it, l'll be back. - I've never seen anything like this. - Let's go! -This place is creepy. -Get a grip. I'm frightened. -What was that? -Quiet, damn it, it'll hear us. -There's something in the trees. - I don't see anything. Quick! Hide in the shed. Daddy's gonna land his huge spaceship... -...and take us home. -Dad, I'm here! Remember, baby, when you need him the most, he'll come back. Shoot! Shoot it! Dad, where are you?! I'm here. I'm right here. Wait! Wait, stop! Hello? -What are you doing out here? -He's right here. Who's here? My dad. What happened, Ben? I saw him. Who? Saw who? -Come on. -Let me help you. I was worried, and Ben forgot this at school... ...so I came by. -You okay? -We'll be fine. We'll be just fine. Don't even think about it. But my real dad's out there. -Ben, l'm your father. -He's gonna come looking for me. You can't go around saying things like that, son. I'm not your son. Okay, this is how it's going to be. Don't tell anyone about this, especially Dr. Stillman. Do you understand me? Well, to help you understand, l'm going to ground you. I'll drive you to school. You'll do your homework at my office. If you disobey me, I promise you, there will be consequences. Now get into bed. Don't, stop! Oh, God, it hurts. You're killing me. -Who's the doctor? -You are. -Who's the doctor? -You are! -Who is the doctor? -You are. Yeah! I am the doctor. And the doctor is in! Yeah, I love it! Damn high school students! Goddamn it! Damn it! You are such a bad boy. Forgive me. Della? Sweetie. Come on, Ben! -What's this? -Jesus. lt's awful. I had to borrow that yellow crime-scene tape stuff. -Calm down. What happened? -Look, I need-- Can you take him somewhere safe, come back and give me a hand? -You don't want him to see this. -Sure, all right. -I'll be back in a few minutes. -Let him out! Shit. Wait a minute. Hold up there. This is a crime scene. You shouldn't be here. -What happened to her? -It was an accident. -You called this a crime scene. -All right, here's the thing. This is official police business. I'm asking you to leave. So much for keeping a small town safe. I told you. I don't like pancakes. -So? Your dad said to watch you. -That's just what we're doing. Stop looking at us and eat up, scout. It's possible it was an accident. I mean, animals could've eaten her face off, right? There's no bite or scratch marks. It looks like her face was just... ...skinned. -Did Ed Turner see anything? -Why would he? Come on, it was Tuesday night. Everybody knows he bangs Divelbuss every Tuesday. Okay, l'm-- He did tell me he saw something here last night. -''Something''? You mean someone. -No, I mean something. But he was in a goddamn panic, raving about some huge creature. Ed wins most original story for getting caught with his pants down. I just can't go accusing people. I know everybody. Well, almost everybody. -We ain't open yet. -I'm not hungry. I saw you through the window. I'm sorry about what happened in my office. It's okay. Friends? His dad don't want him talking to strangers. He's talking to you, isn't he? I've never met anyone stranger. I don't want you to be in trouble so I'll talk. Nod your head yes... ...when it's yes. And you shake your head no when it's no. You know what happened in school today? You heard them talk about it? Did your dad tell you? The nurse in school, she got hurt and she got killed. You know that? How do you feel about that? Do you feel scared? Do you feel sad? Do you feel happy? You know, darling, you ask way too many questions. -Which ain't too smart in a new place. -Especially with this homicide. How do you figure? You show up and suddenly there's a killer in town. -Whoa. How Tippi Hedren of me. -Real funny. How funny do you think it'd be if l... ...put your ass under a citizen arrest? Leave her alone! She's not the only new person in town. Don't look at me like that. I gotta go to the bathroom. Harlan, why don't you just finish setting up? No one comes or goes till the sheriff arrives. Dad? He's here! He's here! Come and get it. -Harlan? -Thanks for the coffee, I gotta run. Goddamn you, Judge. Sit! Unplug that goddamn jukebox! Carlita? Should I call law enforcement? What happened in that bathroom? -Tell me. -I already did. It was my dad. -But your dad's at school. -My real dad. I told you he came back. -He didn't mean to hurt me. -Wait, let me see. lt's okay. Why are you doing this? Come here, l'm sorry. -Judge, you okay? -Karl, I need your car. Here. -Take this. -I couldn't. Wait and I'll give you a ride. Give me the goddamn keys. -Give me the goddamn keys! -What are you doing? I know I deserve to die for what I done in my life, but I'm a coward. Make way. Irma, move aside, please. Coming through. Tell those people to leave, and put up yellow tape. We used it all up at the school. Then get me some prints off the bathroom door. When you're done, find the judge. He's got a goddamn boot here. Billy, could you call my house and see if my son's there? I'm gonna question Stillman. She couldn't do this. You see the bodies? I also see a dead body in my cruiser. Della's not in the morgue yet, and we got two more bodies, friends-- There hasn't been a murder in-- Let's just say a long time. Stillman's been in town less than a week, and I got a fucking body count. -She didn't do it and you know it. -Goddamn it, if there's-- lf you got a theory about who's doing this horrid shit, tell me. What if Harlan and Della and Carlita... ...were just in the way? What if whoever or whatever's doing this is still looking for someone? Like who? -Who? -Like Ben. Ben? He was in the diner, but he wasn't at school that night. Was he? Was he? Look... ...the other night... ...Ben said that he saw something out there in the woods. -I was with-- -I just got through. Ben's at home. Thank you, Billy. I don't have to say that these people dying is very disturbing to me. These three people. -Capitano-- -I told you not to call me that. It was stuck in the bathroom stall. Pierced right through the metal. -What is it? -It looks like some kind of claw. -Sorry if this hurts. -It's okay. Good job. What's that? -How'd you get it? -I picked up something hot as a baby. -Why'd you say that was your dad? -Because he was. He must not have light speed, and it took him this long to get back. Did you know it'd take us years to get to Jupiter? So if that was your dad, why did he scratch you? Because he has a temper. Sometimes he gets so mad he just-- He doesn't know who he's hurting. -Lots of dads are like that. -Yeah, they are. I think sometimes you want things to be true so bad... ...like your mom saying your dad was an alien who'd come back for you... ...that was like a story. Like these stories, they're cool and fun. -You don't believe in him. -No. I don't think you should either. You're too smart. If your dad was smart enough to come here in a spaceship... ...you think he'd act this way to get what he wants? There's someone out here hurting people. If I were you, I wouldn't want that to be my dad. Well, maybe you should meet him. -Didn't mean to scare you. -No, that's okay. -She was just fixing my cut, Dad. -Yeah, I can see that. -You okay? -Yeah. Why don't you hang out here for a bit? You've had a rough morning. I'll check you later. Thank you for bringing him home. I shouldn't have left him at the diner alone. I just thought that he'd be safe there. Look, forget I'm the school psychiatrist for a minute. Pretend I'm just a friend. Ben is suffering from mother loss. He said his alien father was in the bathroom. He's not safe. I can't help him here. I need to take him away. Hear me out, please! -You don't know. -Explain to me. Goddamn it, just go. All right? Go back to where you came from. Just leave. I feel like l'm in some surreal cowboy movie... ...where the sheriff says to get out of town. Miss Stillman. Please come with me. Is that how you got out? Last night, when Della was killed? Don't give me that look. Get away from the window. Now. I'm gonna ask you something, and I want the truth. Were you near that school last night? -I won't ask again. -He didn't mean to do it. -Who? -He's looking for me. He thought l'd be at school. But then those people made him mad. -Christ. -He lost his temper. What's going on? lf you know who's doing this... ...you better tell me. Don't tell me he's your dad. Somebody's killing people. Just some people. No. Not some people. Certain people. Certain very... ...specific people. Don't hurt him. I don't want anybody hurt. I never wanted anybody to get hurt. No, please, no! Stop! Dad, stop! No! Please, don't! It's my room. I won't allow you to bring it to this house... ...if I have to lock you in a closet. Do you understand me? I'm not from here. You always knew that. Didn't you? Here. There's a town meeting later. Folks want you arrested. -You mean lynched. -Not if you tell us who it is. When I left the diner, they were alive. Ask the judge. What happened to the judge? Oh, my God. That's strange. What? These weird brands. These scars. What are they? Oh, my God! Ben has this brand. He was attacked. He said he saw his real dad, but he saw the killer. -I've got to stay with him. -Hold on here. You're in my custody. Let's go to the meeting. Mike and Ben will be there. Oh, Lord... ...have mercy. I have been merciful. Who's there? Don't talk all at once. If you'll just give me a chance. Go ahead, Capitan-- Sheriff. We all know that we've had some murders here, brutal murders... ...and my department is doing... ...everything we can to get the killer. If you'll stay home and lock your doors... ...everything will work out just fine. I'm so sorry. I was with Della Divelbuss last night when she.... I suppose you all know about us. And now my wife.... What did you see? What'd you see, Ed? Who would do that? It's not human. I saw it. Believe me, it's a monster. - It's not from here. It's not of here. - He's crazy. All right. I believe Principal Turner. There is some thing out there, and it's not one of us. And we are all in danger. If Dr. McCann says something's out there.... Now we have to do this our way. We have to comb the woods. We have to find it and kill it! Ben! Ben, wake up. Ben wake up. I need you to wake up now. Did your father give you a shot? He didn't-- He didn't want me to leave the house. McCann, I swear l'm gonna have your medical license. - Why are you here? - Why did you drug him? Did you wake him up? Did you let him out? - This is great. - What are you doing? - This isn't normal. - Ben's not normal. You said it. - He's exceptionally-- - Exceptionally sad. Everyone treats him like a freak. - He lost his mom. - We'll lose him. I'm his dad and doctor. He's obsessed with the idea... ...that he talks to that thing in the woods. The alien will cut him to shreds. Unless we find it first. Hold up. Did you just say alien? - From another planet. - I know what an alien is. - This town is crazy! - Is that your diagnosis? We've got people who've seen it. Principal Turner has. Listen to me. You are a cop. I know you've seen human emotions and rage. It explodes into uncontrollable violence. Humans will do anything. They're monsters. Maybe in big town, missy. Okay, listen up, everybody. Form a line, keep your neighbours a few yards away. We'll go in that direction. If you see the damn thing, no heroics. Wait till we know what it is. Let's move. - Where you going? - I don't know. To the next town to find a sheriff who isn't nuts. I don't think so. And I wouldn't venture out in the woods. Someone might mistake you for an alien. You can come out now. I know you didn't mean to hurt me. You didn't come here to kill people. You came here to find me. So here I am. Can we go home now? Hello? Hello? Ben. God, I miss New York. There you are. Wait! Wait for me. Goddamn it, Mike. If this thing wants you dead, you're dead. Stop! Come back. - We want to go! - We're waiting for the others. - I didn't do anything. - Liar. - She's got some freak power. - Her eyes are evil! You want somebody to blame. We're going home! - You're a danger. - She looked at the window. - Glass flew everywhere. - You're all fucking crazy! Michael, thank God. - You bitch! - Go to hell! You go to hell, missy! Mommy! - Get him out! - Make her pay for it. Get her now. Baby, you've gotta stop doing this. It's gotta be the last time. Don't do anything to them. They'll kill you if you do. - Promise me you won't hurt them. - Promise. Okay. We got her now. - She's done it this time. - Get away from me and my son! Let's finish this. If you hurt him, l'll kill you. I'll kill every one of you! No. They can trace a shot. If you touch him, I'll find you. And next time, I'll make you all burn! Let me see, Maggie. That looks bad. - What do we do now? - We know what to do. I'm sorry. l'm sorry, Maggie. It's okay, buddy. - What about the kid? - I got it. No! We're not gonna kill a kid. It's gonna be okay. It's okay, buddy. - Hello, son. - It was you! Is that-- You think he remembers? You think he remembers anything? What? What is it? What was that? Let's go find Ben. You okay? - He wants to kill us. - Who? My dad. Both of them. Thing's probably already inside after Stillman and the boy. What if it is? That's what you want. Let's think about it. Don't you want this mess to go away? This is our chance to take care of this thing once and for all. I won't let any more people be hurt by this. I live with what I did. Five years. Look at me, it's eating me up. I don't care if I die. We're stopping it. You're my friend, but l'll shoot you if resist. You know I mean it. Okay. lt was just a thought. We'll do it your way. What are they talking about? Ben. I need to talk to you, Ben. What you remembered out in the shed, it didn't happen. Dr. Stillman put false memories in you, Ben. I bet they left their keys in the car. - Have you done this before? - All the time. Dad doesn't know. Do you know what false memories are? lt's when someone makes your brain lie to you. Oh, God. No! Mike! Mike, help me! Help me! No! Ben! You come down here right now! Haven't you killed enough? - You don't know anything. - You covered up a hate crime. - You can't prove it. - You killed her. I saw you. I adopted this kid, for God's sake. How did I know I was raising a killer? How are you doing it, Ben? Are you using those spooky powers of yours? - Like your mother? - Mom didn't burn you all. I did. Of course. Of course. And how'd you make that thing in the movie come alive? He created something to kill for him. Tell her, Ben. Tell her. - Tell her that creature is you. - Okay, that's enough! The sheriff's dead and it's after all of us. I don't think so. I think it's only after me now. Right, Ben? Well, that's not the way it's gonna be. Come here, Ben. Come here! It's okay. It's okay, buddy. You can stop this, right? You know I can't control it. - I can't control it. - Yes, you can. You do what Daddy tells you. You understand? I'm sorry, Ben. I'm sorry. Does it help when I say I'm sorry? I didn't want to do it. You think he'll let me go? Do you think he will? Maybe if I end you... ...I can end it. Don't move, Ben. He's just a child. Please! Please, don't hurt her. It's over. Ben. Hey, Julia. How you doing? No, the job here just didn't work out. I think I like the big town. Yeah, I'm coming home. I'm bringing a friend with me. Subtitles by SDI Media Group
