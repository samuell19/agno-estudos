Yep, yep. All right, all right. Lee, why don't you come to my office and we can discuss the additional coverage. You can set up a date with one of my secretaries, either Candy or Donna. Okay. All right, bye. Oh, hi Benji. Hi Candy. Hi Donna. Oh, hey Benji. My, but you girls look lovely today. Thank you. Candy. Here's the Henderson file. - Thanks, Donna. - You're welcome. Oh, kitty cats. I love kitty cats. I had one once. Oh, that's nice. He got squished by a car. That's not. Yeah. Oh, he's off the phone now, You can go in, Benji. Oh, thank you, Donna. You're welcome. Keep them out of the street. No worries. They're indoor cats. Hey Benji. Hi Danny. Hey, wanna go to lunch? Daisy's Deli has that turkey sausage sandwich for special today. You know the one with the fried green peppers and the onions. I may have to pass. Heartburn, I think. Oh. You're still getting that. About a month now of off and on. Mm. Protonics. I keep telling you, Danny, I've been taking that stuff for years and I can eat anything I want. That's what you keep telling me. Protonics. I'm telling you it, it's much better than any of that over the counter stuff. And the important thing, diarrhea. What? None. Not a drop. Well, you won't get it from taking it. Well, thank you for that very descriptive piece of information. Let's do it another day. Oh, alright. Thursday. We'll see. Okay. Are you okay? What? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Oh, okay. Well I better go. See ya Thursday. You know, when we were at Andrew Farnsworth's funeral, his wife told me that he had complained of discomfort in his abdomen for a very long time and just kept putting off seeing the doctor. Just like you, dad. How come you only speak when you want to point out other people's flaws? Where did you learn that? It's whiter. You really need to set up some guidelines at that place. Are you still getting those pains? It's heartburn, doesn't last long, goes away in minutes. But it keeps coming back. You too? Maybe that's why you don't enjoy life as much as I do. No, it's because I'm older than you. And I know what's really happening in the world while you and your generation are the first to complain and last to act. That's not fair. I'll tell you what's not fair, living as long as I have and knowing what I know based on years of experience and being looked at by younger people as if all of that doesn't mean a thing. - Daniel. - Okay. I'll have it checked out. I can make an appointment for you with Dr. Marshall. No, I'll, I'll do it. You said that last time. Didn't you say you had somewhere to be? No, my shift doesn't start til late. Shift? You got a paying job? I volunteer. As what? A grief counselor. For what? For people having a hard time coping with the final season of "Game of Thrones". It's not funny. You'd be surprised how many people get severely traumatized if their favorite TV show doesn't end the way they expect it to. Like "Breaking Bad", final season perfect. It's not funny. Yes it is. Look, if you had to watch one TV show in your entire life, it would for sure be "Breaking Bad". Everybody knows that. Ever since Bernie died, it's been hard for me to keep things organized. That's why I'm glad you're helping me make the more difficult decisions. Bernie used to do all that. Well, he was good at it. So if you think I need this extra insurance, then I do. Well, it's your decision, Mrs. Loomis, as always. But I think it's better to be safe than sorry. I mean, whatever you say, Daniel. I trust your judgment. I mean, you're so good at this. It must have been your calling in life. An insurance agent? Could all be part of God's plan. Well, I don't know about that. Well, either way, there's still time. Sometimes we have to go through a lot in our lives before it's revealed to us. And when the time is right, when the time comes, God will let you know. You're still a young man. I sure don't feel like a young man. You're just a pup. Oh, right there. I'll, I'll date it. Thank you, Daniel. You're a good man. Have I ever told you that? All the time, Mrs. Loomis. Can I get you guys anything else? No, thanks, Alice. We're good. Can I take this from you? Yeah, yeah, I'm done. And how about you? - Take this... - Oh, no. I'm still working on my fries. Okay. He was just a little bit older than us. Who? Andrew Farnsworth. I told you, you didn't have to go. You know how you are with funerals. Think about something else, will ya? Don't concentrate on this finger or you will miss all that Heavenly gold. Bruce Lee, "Enter the Dragon". Yep. He's dead too. And his son. Just like Beverly. Hey, come on. Don't go there. Finish your fries. I hate funerals. They always remind me of how many people we know who've left us. Like who? Glen Fry, Tom Petty, Burt Reynolds, Aretha Franklin. We didn't know them. And they were still part of our lives. More than Farnsworth was. Benji should've never gone to the funeral. He's gonna drive me crazy the next few weeks. Maybe you should pray for him. No, you do it. Not now. Daniel, it really bothers me that you won't pray with me. Then you do it. Now, you're, you're better at it than I am. How are you gonna get any better at it if you don't even try? God and I have a relationship. I know him. He knows me. Prayer's nice, but I, I don't think it's that big a deal. How can you say that? You know me. I know you and you know I love you. That's why I don't have to say it every day. And that's why it means so much more when you do. We may know you, but sometimes we really need to hear it. Maybe you and Benji should go out, do something together. When was the last time you guys just hung out? I don't know. Might take his mind off of it. Don't get me wrong. I care about him, but it has been a lifetime responsibility. It should be. You're his best friend. Again? Yeah. I'm making an appointment. Okay. Do it. We never go out. That's what I was told. It's a wonderful world, isn't it? Hey, can be. No, I'm not talking about the people in it. I'm talking about the world itself. And sometimes I'm just like sitting around in my apartment and thinking, how good things are. And then I just, just smile, like a real honest to goodness smile. Thank you. Thank you very much. Now the time I like to do a little thing called amateur showcase. This is where I invite someone up from the audience to come up here and show us what you can do. I should have known, ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for our regular, Mr. Benji Baker. Thank you. Thank you very much. And it's, it's I don't need the music for this. The music will just screw me up 'cause this, I'd like to dedicate this to my good friend, Danny. It's Daniel. Yoo-hoo. Daniel. I was wondering, could you walk Pretzel? He has to poopy. I'm sorry, Ms. Tucker. It's Virginia. Virginia. - I'm late for work. - What? Sorry. Hmm. Looks like Daniel's not going to help with poopy, Pretzel. Maybe next time. Come on. Come on, buddy. Let's go. Daniel Adams. Oh, hi honey. No, no, no, go ahead. I couldn't get you an appointment with Martinez until next month. However, I was talking to Dory and she told me about this doctor who just opened his practice right here in Bethany. His name is Dr. Hajia. He's from Indonesia, I think. And he's an internist, best in the field, according to "Entertainment Tonight". Wait, "Entertainment Tonight"? He's gotten a lot of exposure lately because of his client list. Some of them are famous, like Hollywood famous. And get this, he looks just like the soup Nazi from "Seinfeld". Who? No soup for you. Yeah, yeah. Well, what's he doing in Bethany? He has an opening this afternoon at 3:00 p.m. So I grabbed it. His office is off route 88 at 1619 Wilber Road. Don't be late. Wait, wait, wait 3:00 p.m. That's so last minute. Daniel, just leave the office early. You are the boss. Okay. Okay. All right, gimme the address again. It's off route 88 at 1619 Wilber Road. Okay. Bye sweetie. Bye. May I help you? Yes, I have an appointment with Dr. Hajia. 3:00 p.m. 9824. 9824. Going once, going twice. 9825. 9825. Going once, going twice. 9826, 9826. Did you make the appointment? No, my wife did. Daniel Adams? Yes. Have a seat, I'll call your name. Okay. Daniel Adams. Daniel Adams. Follow me, please Take your jacket off. The doctor will be with you in a minute. I know, I know no soup for you, right? How are you my friend? Well, I would say fine, but, and I wouldn't be here, would I? Oh, oh, a joke. Yes, yes, yes. Humor. I love it. And you are? It's not on your tablet there? Oh, you are Dr. Hajia? No, that's me. Humor. Yes. I know. I'm Daniel Adams. Like the beer? No, that's Samuel Adams. A very good, very good. And so you tell the nurse, you have pain? Yes. Yes. I mean, it comes and goes, but it's, it's been getting worse lately. In the butt? No. In the chest? Where? Not, not exactly. Kind of in the middle. Hm. Open mouth please. Hm. Deep breath please. Deeper. Deeper. Three times. Hmm. Cough, please. We need blood. Oh, I'm afraid I'm gonna need a little help getting that out. Oh, oh, humor. Yes. - Very good, very good. - Yes. And the nurse will be in to take your blood and then we see. Yes? If you are really Samuel Adams, she. She. She could. She, she could. She could take your beer. You know, doc, you really should take your job a little more serious. Humor, yes? No. No? Have you recently been bitten by an insect that maybe you are not familiar with? An insect? No, not that I know of at least. Coughing, shortness of breath, blood where it shouldn't be? Where it shouldn't be? No. What's going on doc? Well, I, I don't want you to alarm your wife or your family. Just the tests we did revealed something. What, I mean, revealed what? Have you ever heard of Ebola? Pneumonic plague? Dengue? Hemorat, hemorrhagic infection? No, none of those. Why? Which one of those things do I have? What have I got? It's early, but there's something there. Where? Something where? It's early. Is that why it took so long? Or which of those things is it? It's early. You keep saying that. Well, more tests maybe. I think I need to send the blood for more tests to be sure. Oh wait doc, you can't do this. You have to tell me. You don't know me. I'll go crazy. The waiting could be worse than the diagnosis. Is this serious? Is it? Well, I don't believe in not telling the truth to my patients. I understand. They need to know, yes. Yes. I mean, absolutely yes. So you're saying it's something serious and you want to do more tests and you don't want me to tell my family yet. Yes and no. How serious? Serious. Like fatal serious? I mean, like I could die serious? It's early. I got that part. How serious doc? Come on. Daniel, there's a good chance you have a terminal illness that could result in death in a short period of time. Look, my nurse will call you when we get the results and you will have to come back and see me very soon, yes. Doc. How long? Three weeks, okay. Maybe less, but I will do everything in my power to help you. You will just have to come back and see me very soon, my friend. Yes? It's early. Three weeks, maybe less Ebola. Pneumonic plague. Denny's mathematic infection. I've never heard of any of those. Oh, maybe Ebola. Three weeks. There's a good chance you have a terminal illness. Three weeks, okay. Three weeks. You don't want me to tell my family yet? I better not say anything to Becca. It's early. Well? Well what. Dr. Hajia, how was he? It's early. What did he say? It's early. What's early? That, that's what he said. He took some blood. He's gonna run some tests and get back to me. That's probably the pizza. Pizza? I figured he might be a little late getting home. So I ordered one. Hi, Chloe. Hi Benji. I didn't know you delivered pizzas. How wonderful. Yeah, for about a month now. Benji, I knew you got a job at the pizza place, but didn't know you delivered. Yeah. Hi Danny. How. How, what? You don't have a car. My bike. Too many right turns. Maybe you can hold it at an angle and then that way it all just all just shift right back into place. Don't worry about it. We'll make due. How much do we owe you? Oh, $26.97. That's with delivery. Oh. Thank you, Rebecca. Did he say bike? Beverly? Yeah. Oh, don't worry though. Next time, I'll take a different route. One with little fewer right hand turns. Bye Benji. Daniel! What? It's early. We already established that. What? Wait, what? The clock hasn't rung yet. Do you wanna get up? Oh, I, yeah. Couldn't really sleep. Bad night. You all right? Was it the pain again? No, no, no. Just couldn't sleep. Do you remember the time we first met? Of course, 1987, the church picnic. You're just as beautiful now as you were then. I used to tease you. Called you a holy roller, 'cause you were always trying to please God, always reading and quoting the Bible. It was so important to you back then. It still is. Yeah, I know. I love you. I love you too. Candy. Yes? Any calls from Dr. Hajia's office? Not since the last time you asked. That was only five minutes ago, wasn't it? Yes, it was. Well you have a remarkable memory. Yes I do. What? I'm gonna to go to lunch. Is 9:45. Brunch then. Okay. But what are you going to be back? I don't know. - I don't know? - Okay. - Okay. - So $5. But where is this place? This is kinda like the day before a colonoscopy, spending every minute terrified they'll find something in between all the bathroom runs. Except this time, you won't be waking up afterwards to see if they found something. Excuse me. Excuse me, sir. Can I ask you a question? You look like you may not have a lot of time left. Although you look really great for your age. But I mean, obviously you have less time ahead of you than behind you. You know, when the time comes, you know, when you find out you have to go or exactly when you're going to go, what do you do with the time you have left, whatever it is? Probably watch all six seasons of "Breaking Bad". Hi mom. Daniel, why aren't you at work? Can I come in? Who died? What? Why would you say that? You come to see me in the middle of a weekday? No phone call, no gift. What else could it be? Maybe I just wanted to see you. Fat chance. Mom. The last time you came to see me like this was when you and Rebecca got pregnant for the first time. Why did people say that? Say what? Me and Becca. We. We didn't get pregnant. She did. Oh my. So Chloe's not your daughter? No. Did you just find out? No. I mean, yes, Chloe is my daughter. Dylan? No, no, no, no. That's not what I meant. I don't know why people say that, we didn't get pregnant. She. Nevermind. It's not why I'm here. Something has happened or is happening to me and well, I have something that I really like to tell you. Okay. Ever since I found out, I've been seeing things from a different perspective, you know, the sun, the sky, the flowers. I mean, I look around my house differently, everything and the rooms, the furniture, color and the walls. And it what, makes you wanna redecorate? I watched Becca last night as she was sleeping, thinking how beautiful she was and how much it's gonna hurt when I tell her. I really need to tell someone. I thought being my mother, that if I was gonna tell someone that you should be the first. Well Daniel, honey I understand. And I am so glad you decided to share this with me first. Thanks mom. I don't know what brought this on at your age, but it's a different world with the internet and all. Oh yeah. Does Rebecca suspect anything? Mm, no, I don't think so. Although I have probably been acting a little funny since I found out. Have you been walking funny? What? To be honest, Daniel, I should have seen this coming. Do you remember when you were 11 years old and I caught you trying on your sister's dress? I just thought it was an innocent curiosity. Oh, you mean the Halloween costume? And you did play with your sister's cabbage patch dolls a little too much. You mean the ones that I was gonna sell for her? It's okay, Daniel. But I think it's important that you tell Rebecca as soon as possible while she still has a few good years left in her. The kids won't care. Nowadays, everything's okay with them. It's okay, honey. Hate the sin, love the sinner. Huh? Now you just sit there and be whatever or whoever you are and I'll go make some tea. Ellen comes on at three. Bad idea. Do you wanna go see Daniel? Do you have to poopy? Good. Daniel? Well, that was a little rude, don't you think. We're good, right? You know, I never did explore other religions. I wonder if one's any better than the other. Maybe they know something the others don't. Hello. We are from the Church of Jesus Christ of Modern Day Saints. Do you belong to a church? Yes. My wife attends Bethany Baptist church and I go when I can. I heard that that's a very nice church. Yeah. Guys, I just got home from work and I'm really not feeling that good right now. We understand. Thanks. We just wanted to make sure you are good with God. My name is Daniel. I'm elder Jones. I'm elder Wallace. It would seem that I'd be the one carrying that title here. Yes, it would appear that way. So do you have first names or did you have to lose those? We prefer the elder title and then our last names. Well, it feels a little awkward, but okay. Could I call you Wallace and Jones maybe? - Sure. - Sure. So did you see that play, the Book of Mormon? You know the one by the South Park guys. Oh. Funny. Yeah, pretty funny. You saw it? Yes. We may have lost our first names, but not our sense of humor. Of course. So you guys out recruiting today? We don't recruit. We are missionaries. Oh, sorry. I thought that's what you guys, you know, the Mormons do. Yes, we know. So Wallace, what did you mean by me being okay with God? Well, if you don't mind me saying, you look like a troubled soul. Well, I just found out something that could affect my whole future, or what's left of it. Something bad? Could be. Are you guys okay or, or good with God? Well, I think I can speak on behalf of elder Jones when I say yes, we are. So hypothetically, if you were to die, let's say in three weeks. Three weeks? Yes, three weeks to live. Are you sure that when you die, you're going to be with God? Well, I think I can speak on behalf of elder Jones when I say yes, we are. Well, I didn't know if it was any different for you, you know, being that you guys have your own book and all, you know, maybe, you know something the others don't and that gives you more of like a, a backstage pass, you know, all access. Heaven's not a rock concert, Daniel. I know, I know. What I meant was do Mormons know something other religions don't that might make it more of a sure thing when one dies? Well, if I had three weeks left live. Hypothetically. Hypothetically. Hmm. Well, I think I would want to spend it with my family. Hmm. I would agree. We believe that family is just as important in life as it is in death. Behold, children are a heritage from the Lord, the fruit of the womb. Fruit of the loom? Womb. Oh, sorry. There's nothing more wonderful and fulfilling then the presence of family. Children are a heritage from the Lord, offspring, a reward from him. Now, speaking of offspring, look who's come home, my son Dylan. Hello? Hi. Mormons? We prefer church of Jesus Christ of Modern Day Saints. Hey Dylan, why don't you go upstairs to your room and play one of your video games, like space invaders. Space invaders? Or any video game? I wasn't even born then. I'm entertaining guests right now. You're entertaining Mormons. - How? - Dylan! Mormons! How cool. And my daughter, Chloe. Oh. I'm Chloe. I just said that. I'm elder Jones. I'm elder Wallace. Wow. And you guys look so young. Mormons. How cute. Chloe, they're people, not puppies. I am so happy to meet you. I've seen you wandering around the neighborhood and I never thought my dad would ever invite you into the house. At least he said he never would. Imagine my surprise. Proof there is a God. - Yes, there is. - You just let me know if you'd like anything to drink or eat. I'll get you anything you want. Mormons. Bye, Chloe. What was that last part again about offspring being a reward? Lord, I'm terrible at praying. You know that. But if there was ever a time that I needed to pray, it's now. I don't wanna die. Please, not now. I still have so much I wanna do. I know, how many times have you heard that, right? I'm only in my 50s for God's sake. For, for your sake. You know. Although I gotta admit, it's a pretty messed up world we live in today. I, I've seen just some real hate, Not, not just what comes from people, but as an entity with, with a mind of its own, from the looks of things, it's gonna get a lot worse before it gets any better. That might be the only reason I wouldn't be afraid to die. Not so sure I wanna be around to see the results of all that hate. Lord, I, I have and asked you for much in my life, but I'm asking now, please see me. Feel me. Touch me, heal me. Wait, that's a song from the Who. Scratch that. If you do, I promise you I will change. Not that I've been that bad of a person. Like Benji. I promise to spend more time with him. I'll pray more. I'll read my Bible every day or as much as I can. Okay, every day. I'll give 10% of my income to our church. Okay, 20%, maybe more to see how I'm doing. I'll even walk Ms. Tucker's dog. Can I think about that one or is it too late? Okay, nevermind. I'll become a, a man of God, of you. You know what I mean. Amen. How's that? Good morning, sunshine. Good morning, my love. No time for breakfast. I'll grab something on the way. Good to see you eating at the table, son. Is it just me or has dad been acting a little strange over the weekend? You mean like putting $50 in the collection plate at church? Or going to the church in the first place? It's the Mormons. God bless you, sir. Yeah, I know it's an older vehicle, but with all the upgrades. Fab fours grumper. Yeah. Full width. Black. Front winch HD bumper. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Alpine I 209 GM N-restyle system. Nice. Could all that even be installed on that old of a vehicle? It wasn't easy. Well, even with all those upgrades, the stated value vehicle is the same. Oh, come on, Danny, you can do it. I figure we're looking at about 17 grand worth of coverage. That's all for my own peace of mind. Well, you know, I'm really not. It's a little extra coverage. Wouldn't call it a little. Come on, Danny, you know how I am. It. I'm gonna take care of this thing like a, like a newborn baby. Come on, it'll just make me feel better. For me, man. Okay. For you. God bless you, man. - Donna? - What? Check your email. What, why? Just, just do it. What? You okay? Yeah, I just had to give myself a shot. I almost forgot. What's in the briefcase. My life. Your life? Okay. By the way, my treat today. Why? Well, it's been a while since I've treated so, you know. Whoa, you've never treated. Don't look at gift horse in the mouth. How's everything been going? Well, my boss, Antonio, he hasn't been too happy with my delivery work. Even got even more unhappy when I asked him for a raise. I meant since the funeral and Beverly. Why have you told me all this time not to bring her up and now you do. Maybe sometimes it is better to talk about it, you know, with a friend instead of therapists or doctors. Who knows your better than me. Why now? I don't know. Sometimes we need to take advantage of the time we have. What do you mean? I mean, you know, how often do we reach out to help someone in pain, but end up just spending our lives thinking, no, hey, they'll be okay. Would you like to talk about it? No. Well, you can. I mean, you can come to me with anything. Just like I can come to you with anything. You never come to me with anything. But I could, you know, for whatever. I just want you to know that I'm your best friend and I'm here for you for as long as God allows. Why, are you going somewhere? As always, it's up to him. Okay, Danny. I, I gotta get back. Wow. It's been a long time since you did that, too. Too long. Sounded urgent. I was in the neighborhood with my granddaughter. I hope you don't mind that I brought her in. Oh, sure. No, that, that that's fine. Hi there, what's your name? Olivia. Olivia. That's a very pretty name. Thank you. I hope everything is okay. Oh, oh, it is. I just thought it would be important to tell you face to face. I was looking over that umbrella policy, the one you just took out, and I'm thinking maybe it's not necessary after all. Oh really? Well, I trust your judgment and you know what's best. Well, thanks. There you go. Is, is this the way out? Yes. - Thank you. - Thank you. Have a great day. Daniel? - Yeah. - What's up? I don't know. He's been acting strange ever since he went to see that. Dr. Hajia. Oh, he went to go see him. Yeah. Got to tell you, I talked him into it. Strange how? Like he's got something on his mind. Didn't you say he was talking to Mormons? You think that's it? What? Like they brainwashed him or something. It's just one time. Was it something Dr. Hajia told him? Maybe. He said they were gonna run some routine blood tests and he's been waiting to hear the results. It's taking them forever. That's it. Blood tests always make me nervous. Yeah, probably. Otherwise he's doing everything he normally does. Hmm. Come here, baby. Did everything come out okay, baby? Sure did. There it is. Thank you so much for walking Pretzel. I really do appreciate it. - Sure. - Would you like to come in for some refreshments? Thank you, no. I gotta get back. Am I losing my mind or did I just see you hand a baggy of dog poop to Ms. Tucker? Honey, is there anything I should know? No. Let's just say that for now, I've had an epiphany. Epiphany? Can you even spell that word? Probably not, but I know what it means. And that's all that's important. And what was your epiphany? Truth is there are no backstage passes. Backstage passes? To heaven. Nevermind. If, if we're to be good with God, we got to show we're serious. I mean God helps those who help themselves, right? For however long we're here. You can't earn salvation, Daniel. I know that. It doesn't sound like it. So this is why you've been talking to Mormons and walking Ms. Tucker's dog? No. And yes. Pick up the book, read it and decide for yourself. Rebecca. Oh boy. What? You've only called me Rebecca three times since I've known you. The night we first met, I told you my name and you repeated it just before we kissed for the first time. The time you accidentally dropped the new car keys in the sewer, outside the hotel we were staying at in Florida. And the first and only time you've ever asked if your mother could live with us. Really? Only three. So get to what you're gonna say. The last time I tried to tell someone it didn't go so well. Your mother. How'd you know? Mom. Not now, honey, your dad may be in the middle of another epiphany. Ah, what? The reason I've been acting a little strange the last few days. You're going to become a Mormon. No. In the Chicago suburb of Bethany, Illinois, an Indonesian man posing as a doctor was arrested two days ago and is now in custody. Dr. Morak Hajia, also known as the doctor of the stars, has developed a somewhat notable reputation for treating various celebrities throughout the entertainment industry. Dr. Hajia has been under investigation since the closing of his place of practice in Los Angeles last month for allegedly posing as a doctor, seeing patients, diagnosing them with terminal cancer and then charging them for tests that were never performed. It appears the fake doctor thought the little town of Bethany would be the perfect place to hide and continue his illegal practice. He's being charged with the unlicensed practice of a healthcare profession. In other news, four men were charged last week with car jacking a woman in the... Yes! Rebecca! Mormons. - Daniel. - Yes? Don't drop me. Oh. I am so sorry, Daniel. For what? I was the one who recommended you go to him. If it wasn't for me, you never had to go through all of that. Hey. It's not your fault. Yes it is. Okay, it is. So you got yourself all worked up for nothing. What must have been going through your mind? Well, I was losing my mind. That night, I told you I was gonna pray and I did. I was so sure I was gonna die, I, I even asked God to heal me. You did? It was the most sincere prayer that I've ever prayed from the heart. The most honest that I've ever been with him. That's wonderful. I even went as far as to promise him a bunch of things I do if he healed me. Oh, I'm glad that's over. I don't know how long I could have kept that up. Kept what up? The promises. The ones you made to God? Yeah. You told me it was the most honest you've ever been with him. It was. So you're not gonna keep the promises you made? What? No, I, I, yes, of course. Other than your blood pressure being a little high, I'd have to say you're, you're fine. Everything's good. Well, what about the chest pains? Well, that was probably anxiety. The x-rays didn't show anything and the stress test came back normal. But you know what? I think I'm gonna have to put you on some blood pressure meds. Is that really necessary? You want to die? No. Then take the pills. Morning ladies. - Good morning. - Good morning. You got a call from Mr. Hargrove. He wants you to call him. Anything else? Oh, the main office sent an email to confirm the changes in Mrs. Loomis' coverage. Right. Wait, you know what? Don't respond. I need to look over that coverage again. Okay. Here you go. Hey, dad, can at table 12? Sure. Benji. I got another complaint about a delivery you did. I'm sorry, Antonio. I'll be more careful when I ride. This bike thing isn't working out. I can't keep losing more customers. I thought you said you had a driver's license. It expired the long time ago. Look, Benji, you've been here only a month and it just isn't working out. Then no raise. No, I told you that the last time you asked. The no job? No job. Sorry. Mom, what are you doing here? Anita. Anita, what are you doing here? Well, I'm standing out here on your porch waiting for you to invite me in the house. Oh, sorry. Come on in. I've been experimenting again. Pickled Kiwi pie. Lovely. Can I get you something? Bourbon and Coke? We don't have any hard liquor. How about a bottle of water? Eh. Water makes me sick. Is my son around? He's at work. I hear he came to visit you a couple of weeks ago. Yes and what he told me was quite a shock. Oh yes, it was. So he told you? Yes, he did. Took him a while to work up the courage, but he finally did. Well, I told him to. You're taking it quite well. Well, it was quite a shock at first, but once he stopped seeing that guy and went back to the other he's much better now. There was another? Of course. He had been seeing him for at least the last 12 years. And didn't really like his bedside manner. So I suggested he sees someone else. You, you suggested. Well he was so unhappy with the other guy, I thought it would doing good to see someone else. Something wrong? Honey, not if it's okay with you. Of course it is. Men, you know how they are, never happy with what they have and always looking for something better. Well, okay. I think we're done. That's the reason I came to make sure everything was okay with all that. Hmm. Tell Danny I stopped by. Hi grandma. Hello, Daren. Dylan. Eh, close enough. Give your old grandma a big hug. Can I ask you a question, sweetie? Yeah, sure grandma. Have you ever tried on one of your sister's dresses? No. Attaboy. Now go play some football. How about them Bears, huh? Bears suck, grandma. Daniel. Crap. Sorry, Virginia. I'm doing a new workout program. Gotta keep the heart rate up. It's not moving. It'll just take a minute. No, no, no. I gotta go inside. I have to run in place indoors. Can't lose my momentum. The doctor says I can get skin cancer. Too much sun. Don't wanna die before my time. Well Pretzel, looks like you're on your own. Hi, sweetie. Was that Ms. Tucker I heard yelling out front? What? No. I'm pretty sure it was. Oh yeah, you're right. She was yelling at the postman. You know Mrs. Tucker. Miss. Miss, Ms. Tucker. And the mail came hours ago. Really? Benji called. Yeah, what'd he want? He sounded upset about something. He wants to see you. He said he'll come by the office tomorrow and maybe you guys can talk at lunch. Sure. Everything back to normal? Everything. Did you check your email? No. Check my email. Premature. Yep. Next year. What happened to next month? And only 2%, not 10. Why would he do that? I knew it was too good to be true. You told me it was come covered. What it was above the market value of the car. You knew that. Of course I did. That's why I took out the additional coverage, which you said would cover everything. Lee, you've been my client for many years. I'm sorry if my good intentions may have been misleading. Misleading? Is everything okay? Yeah, we're good. All I know is you said it was covered. How is that misleading, huh? Well, you know, this could be looked at another way. How? The reason you took out the additional coverage with everything that's happened, it might look suspicious on your part. That so? Well wouldn't a good agent have known that and not approved it? You know, this doesn't look any better for you than it does me, Daniel. Maybe we'll just let the Illinois Department of Insurance decide. Use your good intentions to pick up the check. Lee, come on. Great. - Daniel. - Daniel. - Hello. - Hello. Guys, what are you doing here? You said anytime we were in the neighborhood and we were in the neighborhood. Yeah, well that was obviously a failed attempt at a subliminal goodbye. Can we come in? Gee, you know, I, I just got in from work and there's a lot going on. We understand. Elder Wallace. I don't see the a dog. Maybe if we hurry, we can make it. Elders, guys wait. All right. Just for a little while. And how are you Daniel? Good, good. With God? Oh yeah. Good with God. Yeah, everything's great. Great with God. Couldn't be better. That's wonderful. Did you get a chance to read the pamphlets we left you? Pamphlets? Yes I did. What did you think? Everything looked good. You know, made sense within the context of your religion. But you know what, there was one thing I had a big issue with. What's that? Well, the whole coming back thing. The resurrection. Yeah. So in your religion, you believe that everyone comes back from the dead? Yes. Everyone? Everyone. Isn't that reincarnation? No, with reincarnation, you would come back as something else. Like a cat or a bird. And with the resurrection, you come back as you. In the same body? Yeah. Huh? I don't know if he was a Mormon, but that might explain Keith Richards. I mean, he looks like he may have died and come back a couple of times. Who? From the Rolling Stones. - Oh. - Oh, I see. Well and, and what if you're cremated? I mean, do you come back as baby powder? Ah, you see, that's why I'm having the problem. You know, honestly, I lost all interest in people coming back to life after the seventh season of "The Walking Dead". Oh, but that's... Look guys, I totally respect your faith and your religion, but I'm afraid it's not for me. But Daniel. What? I thought you said you were a Christian. I am. Then you understand about the resurrection. I do. You should. All right, guys, really appreciate you stopping by and talking with me, but I was messed up. Okay, truth is this doctor told me I may have had only a few weeks to live. Hypothetically. Right, hypothetically. Well, as it turns out, I'm not gonna die after all. Well, that's great. Praise God. Well, that's just it. I mean, actually God had nothing to do with it. I mean, the doctor was a fake and I didn't need him to heal me after all. So like I said, I'm not gonna die. But Daniel. Yeah? You will. Nice talking to you, Daniel. Elder Jones. Here. Oh, no need. We, we know where the door is. Daniel, hey, what's going on, man? I don't have time now, Benji. I've got a really serious problem that needs my attention... Yeah, me too. Not like this you don't. Look, I've been trying to get ahold of you for days now. Look, man, I'm in big trouble, okay. Something's happened and I could lose my license. Yeah. Really bad. Well, okay, the same with me. I mean, how about, look, you said that I could come to you and I am. Benji. Benji. You're just gonna have to deal with whatever it is, okay. You're a full grown man for crying out loud. Hey, crying out loud. Look what happened is I went, what? You walking? Oh, oh, I'm sorry. I'll calm down. Look Benjamin. I've known you ever since seventh grade. I know just about everything that's ever happened to you. But not what just happened. The world does not revolve around everything that happens to you, man. I didn't say, cause you said I could come to you. - I have my own life... - Then why'd come to me. And right now I have a very serious problem. What? Did you find out that you're gonna die after all? No. I told you I'm not going to die. Why should I. Hey, something... You told me a lot of things... Somethings happening that could jeopardize my reputation and could result in me losing my business. But no matter what happens... - I don't... - Hey, I'll get over it. I'll get over it. That's what you need to do. But Danny, I... Beverly's dead. Get over it, man. Let it go. Benji. One of my customers, Lee Hargrove, just filed a complaint with the Illinois Department of Insurance. Yeah, he claims that I intentionally sold coverage above and beyond the market value of the car and verbally promised and we cover it. - Did you? - Yes. But he told me he had someone he thought would buy it for 40 grand if he did the upgrades. So I thought, what are the odds something would happen to the car in the interim. And? It burned down to the ground last week and was totaled. And I think he might have done it. Wasn't he one of your best clients? Yes, Becca. - That's why I did it. - Don't yell at me! It happened right after the whole Dr. Hajia thing. You wouldn't believe what was going through my mind at the time. And that's why I was double checking my life insurance policy and giving away money, talking with Mormons. Now look, what's happened. What does this have anything to do with all of that? He was my best customer. I thought I was doing something good for him personally. Then you took it out on Benji. What about Benji? Your father told Benji to get over Beverly. His bike? No. Beverly was a real person. So? Benji was engaged woman named Beverly Arnold many years ago. They were out test driving a new car they had bought when the car missed a sharp curve at 60 miles an hour and ended in the ditch. She wasn't wearing a seatbelt. She died. He passed out at the wheel from low blood sugar. At the time, he didn't know he was diabetic. That's why he doesn't drive? Yes. In addition to that, he's got problems with his heart. That's why he is on all those meds. He's never been the same. That doesn't sound like something that easy to get over. No Chloe, it doesn't. Maybe Danny's right Time to let go. Can I ask you something? What did you promise? To who? God. What did you promise, Daniel? Lots of things, like walking Cujo. What else? It doesn't matter. I'm okay. It was a false alarm. He knows that. But as stupid as this sounds, I just thought the promises I made were contingent upon him healing me. I said it was stupid. If a man vows a vow to the Lord or swears an oath to bind himself by a pledge, he shall not break his word. God doesn't make deals. He isn't someone that you can bribe into healing you, especially with vain promises of being a good person. You know that Daniel. Rather than being concerned with keeping promises, maybe you should be more concerned with what God really requires of you now. Admit your weaknesses to him and pray for God to renew your heart. Now that's easy for you to say. You've always been better at this sort of stuff than me. Then get better at it. He passed away. Excuse me. The old man. That's why you looked over here, right? How did you know about the old man? Probably shouldn't be talking to strangers. I shouldn't really be talking to anyone, but you. Me? Or anyone. Well you don't have anything to worry about with me. Is that a promise? Yes, that's a promise. Someone watching over you? Always. The last time I was here, I thought I was gonna die. The park looked different then. I, I saw things that I had taken for granted as it for the first time. And now? Now? Now it all looks like it did before. Why? Probably because I'm like I was before I thought it might be over. Were you scared? Yep. And I did a lot of stupid things because of it, some things that became mistakes, big ones. You sure did. I even asked God to heal me, but as it turned out, I went to a different doctor later and found out I was okay. And Daniel, how do you know he didn't? Wow the strangest thing just happened in the park. Dad. They found Benji on the floor of his apartment, unconscious. What? They found Benji on the floor of his apartment. But who's they? His landlord, the police. Well, what happened? They don't know. They're still looking into it, but they think it was his heart due to his diabetes. What hospital? They did everything they could. It's too late. Our Father who in heaven, hallowed by your name. Your kingdom come, Your will done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debts. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory. Amen. And now Benji's best friend, Daniel would like to say something. Best friend. Death is terrifying. Don't think it isn't. The comfort of never knowing when it will happen or how, gone and usually that's when we turn to God for help as I did, when I was told I may have only three weeks to live. I even made promises out of fear and desperation, even though I thought I was being honest to God, I, I wasn't. Like the doctor, I was also an imposter pretending to be a loving, caring Christian. I've known Benji since the seventh grade. We grew up together. Even back then, people thought he was strange. And even though I may not have known it at the time, I was his best friend. And unfortunately it took me all of these years to realize that he was mine. Now, one of the promises I made to God was to be a better friend to Benji. And now the last memory I'll have of him is him trying to reach out to me and I wasn't there for him. I, I don't believe that this is a consequence for not keeping one of those promises I made. But right now it feels like it. Goodbye, my friend. I can't remember if I ever told you this all these years, but I love you. And I know you're with God know. Rest in peace, Benji. Benji. Well, it took some time, but by God's grace, I made good on the promises that I made Him, all of them. And it wasn't until I began being honest with myself that I found out what my true calling was in life. So, here I am. And since this is my first day, I wanted all of you to know how I became your pastor. I'd like to close with a verse from Numbers, 30, chapter two, If a man vows a vow to the Lord or swears an oath to bind himself by some agreement, he shall not break his word. He shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth. So the next time someone asks you about your faith and you tell them you're a Christian, be honest to yourself and to God. Wonderful sermon, Pastor Daniel. Well, thank you Rose. So mom, what did you think? Very nice. Very nice. You messed up a couple of times, but you covered it up well. Messed up? I didn't mess up. When? - When you... - You did real good for your first time, honey. Well, I hope so. I hate to think the three years it took to get ordained or for nothing. I just hope the almighty is good with what you're doing and being the way you are. Mom. You think that becoming a priest would've changed everything. A pastor. Whatever. Mom, we have talked about this many times. Actually, it did mom. It did? It changed everything. Well, it's about time. But mom. Let it go. Oh, we gotta go. Come on, Rose. Not so fast. Goodbye everyone. - Bye, grandma. - Bye Dad, you did great. Thanks honey. So pastor Dan, it's a bold move, you giving up your old job to do this. Well, he really didn't have much choice in the matter. Dylan! What, he didn't. Well, sometimes we lose something in his life... Like your license. Dylan! It just means God has something better in store for us. Whether you wanted it or not. Dylan! No, no he, he's right. I take full responsibility for what happened. Look, I, I gotta get going. Thanks for coming, Dylan. Call us every once in a while. Okay? Time to get this little girl home. Yeah. Thanks for coming honey. Oh, of course. You take good care of my girls, James. I will. She'll make sure I do. Bye sweetie. Good sermon, Daniel. Hey, hold on. Thank you. I'll take good care of her. I know you will. You know, I never asked you out of all the promises you made to God, which one was the hardest to keep? So did I ever think I would become a pastor, that it was my calling in life? Absolutely not. Only God knew that. Well, it looks like Mrs. Loomis was right. Sometimes it can take almost a whole lifetime to find out what it is. One thing I do know, the next time a doctor tells me I only have three weeks to live, I'm getting a second opinion.
