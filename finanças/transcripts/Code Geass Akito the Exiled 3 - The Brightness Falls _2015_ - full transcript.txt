Revolutionary Calendar, year 228. It has been 7 years since Japan was conquered by the Holy Britannian Empire and renamed Area 11 . In Europe, the United Republic at Europia continued to resist Britannia. Leila went into battle with Akita and the others. In that battle, they encountered a golden Nightmare. Its knight's name was Shin Hyuga Shaing. He is Akito's alder brother, whom he had not seen since they were children. Euro Britannian Territory Saint Petersburg Caesar's Palace Show some respect! Kneel, Lord Kingsley! I have been granted full authority by His Majesty. Here is the proof. The imperial scepter! You will henceforth take my words as His Majesty's and you will obey them! Whew, it's freezing... Well, I'm fine as long as I have this. Eliza! Elizabeth! I've brought you lunch! Eliza! Time to eat! Eliza? I wish you would finally get used to me. Come on out. I just can't manage Eliza. Leila... We've been stuck here for a whole month! United Republic of Europia Territory Warsaw I've been checking in with HQ every day. United Republic of Europia Army Garrison Former Warsaw Sports Stadium - Besides, the people here are-- - Look at that! If it isn't Eleven soldiers! Do your best to die instead of us, okay? Even Elevens might become heroes when they die! - The supply trailer has... - The summary sheet has been copied. United Republic of Europia Army Supply Corps Warsaw Branch Fix it, or you're not getting a single pencil! - The Lt. Colonel sure is uptight. - Careful, he'll hear you! Are you an idiot? You are, aren't you?! Reread the manual from page 1! Hm? My name? You want to know my name? Sure, I'd be glad to tell you. My name is Lt. Col. Pierre Anou! Commander, 103rd Supply Corps! Idiot! I'll slow that unit's supplies to a crawl! All right, people! Don't just sit around! I'm surrounded by idiots... Assault Unit ZERO Operation Commander, Leila Malcal Her?! You don't have what it takes. 0-Of all the places to run into you again, Leila Malcal! I'd heard that being a soldier was easier than this! I'm sick of this crap! Hey, just do whatever you can. What's the point of coming to the bazaar if we don't have any money? My ID also has a credit function. How much is on it? Around a million Euros, I think. - A million?! - A million?! Then let's eat lots of good food! - Now you're talking! - You're not a It. colonel for nothing. Oh, wow! Oh, wow! Oh, wow! Oh, wow! These are so great! So's this one! Can we get some, Leila? Right, that's a good idea. - The army hasn't issued us uniforms-- - Come on, Leila! Oh, this one is cute! I think this one would look good on Yukiya. Better than on you, at least. Hey, pops! Can you cut me a better deal on this? Okay? Paar thing... You poor thing. That can't be right! Are you sure that thing isn't broken? It can't be, I just had it checked! See? Your credit's no good. But that's not possible... - Bring cash if you want these! - Hey, wait a minute! What the hell? What's going on? United Republic of Europia Army Garrison Security Gate I'm getting a code error. There's no registration info recorded on it. I can't let you in with that ID. You checked it when we went out! - I'll get to the bottom of it at HQ, so let us through! - He's an idiot. The guy's an idiot. Sorry, I don't make the rules. Civilians can make arrangements through the Public Relations Department. Stop screwing with us, damn it! That bastard... If I run into him on the street, I'm gonna belt him 5 or 6 times! You mustn't stoop to violence, Warrant Officer Sayama. Aren't you pissed off? It can't be helped. A military has to strictly adhere to regulations. Wasn't he just harassing us? That's certainly possible. You poor thing. You're a cursed child. Let go. You poor thing, you have such a terrible curse on you... Die. I'll lift the curse for you. Let go! How could you do that to a little old lady?! - It hurts! It hurts so much! - Great Granny! Her leg is badly scratched! Are you all right? - It hurts! It hurts! - This scratch might kill her! We don't have any money to take her to a doctor! If only we had enough money to buy medicine for her! Are these old biddies shaking us down? - How could you say such a thing? - Growing old is so sad... You attack us and we're the thieves? Oh, it hurts... She's done for! She's going to die! We really are sorry. I hate to break it to you ladies, but we don’t have any money. - We don’t even have a place to sleep. - You what?! - How can that be? - They say they're broke. That was a waste. You know what that means, right, little lady? A glass of wine after a job really hits the spot! And look at these sweet, young servants! But just look at those indecent outfits! - That's for sure! - I'll go blind! Oh, you know you love it! What's the deal with this horde of grannies? They have so much energy... She doesn't look like she's at death's door to me. - I'm sorry, but we have to go back and-- - Trying to run away, eh? N-No, we wouldn't dream of it! Then get changed to get to work! Stop it! Please, stop! That's all of it! Don’t look! - You have the loveliest skin! - Thank you. Just like we used to have when we were young! That's for sure... Am I wearing this right? - That looks wonderful! - You look like me when I was young! Oh... What's this smell?! These clothes are all musty! Are they? It's not surprising, I haven't taken those out in 50 years! Damn those crazy old broads... - Like a rock! - Hands off, granny! My outfit seems a bit girly. It's cute. If you don’t hurry it up, you’re not getting any dinner! - It's hard to do this by myself! - Then get someone to help. Leila! Leila! Jeez, where did she go? You there. "Akito", was it? YES? Go fill those buckets with water from the river. Lt. Hyuga, let me do that! - I'll do it. - But I... Find something that you can handle, Commander. - Is this about right? - Leila, are you done? I-I did it wrong? You're terrific at chopping! I had to learn to cook for myself when I was little. You're a good boy, Yukiya! The pasta's done boiling! She didn't... I messed up... A'! 'Emu? No thanks! You don’t need to touch the food, Leila! Akito, help fetch the wine. - Is it in the cart? - Yes, Ryo is already-- I'll do it! - How can you drink all this? - I'll help! No, Leila! Don’t touch those! - I can carry this much! - Don’t! If you drop it, they'll all break! Find something else, okay? Fine, I understand... It's unthinkable that she wouldn't check in! She must be... Think positive thoughts, boss! Right, we did get a report from her from the Warsaw garrison. I'm sure that she's fine. I understand, Maj. Hammel. But she isn't a child. We haven't been able to reach Cdr. Malcal for three days! Shouldn’t we assume that something has happened to her? Maybe... Anyway, there's nothing that we can do about it from here. We ought to file a search request, Deputy Commander! I'm not so sure... - What do you think of this one? - This fabric is wonderful! Would this make your luminous beauty even more radiant, Miss Alice? This pattern is cute. But this color is pretty, too! Brother, look! Which do you like better? - Let me think... - Come on, which? Mother would be a better judge. Oh, my! Shin is embarrassed! Please don’t tease, Mother. Brother is blushing! Now, now, Alice. Then let's go with this pattern in this color. Water... Water... Water... Suzaku, water... Bring me water! Suzaku... Bring me water... Sister... You can't sleep? I had no idea that I was this useless. They're only good at it because they had rough childhoods. It's nothing to be worried about. Are you trying to make me feel better? Not really. I'm just stating the facts. Our experiences here aren't ones that you need to have. But aren't they important skills to have to get by in life? It's better if you can get by without needing them. You might be right. But I feel like I'm completely helpless. Like with my father. Your father, Commander? He was a politician. In Europia after defeating from Britannia... Wait, Assemblyman Breisgau was your father? You've heard of him, too, Lieutenant? He was. My father... was Bradow Von Breisgau. Breisgau! Breisgau! Breisgau! Breisgau! The freedom that we can have will not be given to us! Naturally, it won't come from the hands of policymakers, either. Those who have won that freedom have a responsibility and a duty to pass it down through the ages. Freedom is only won at the cast of human-- The assassination of Assemblyman Breisgau... Yes. It happened when I was six. You also lost your mother then? Yes. In the chaos after my father's death. Please get out of here with Leila, Claudia! Mama ? Leila... I was the only survivor. I was a stranger, so I'm grateful to the Malcals for taking me in and raising me. But... ...I want the strength to live on my own terms. What do you intend to do about the ZERO unit, Gen. Smilas? Have you heard of the Maid of Orleans? Joan of Arc, sir? She received a divine revelation to save France, which was exhausted in the Hundred Years' War against England. We might need one of those. Our own Joan of Arc. - Put your back into it! - Yes, ma'am! - Harder! - Yes, ma'am! - Hit it harder! - Yes, ma'am! - Harder! - Yes, ma'am! Thank you for teaching me the proper way! What's up with that? - Hard work is contagious, I guess. - Work faster! - Let's help when we're done here. - I'll try! Leila! Hold on tight! I will! Don’t worry! Then here goes! Ready, go! That looks fun. Want me to take over? Quit bothering us. You're on water detail, Ryo! - Now we're gonna wring it out! - Ready! Okay, then... - Your rear is as fine as ever! - What do you think you’re doing?! - Come on, where's the harm? - You crazy old broad! - Ryo! - Oh, no! Ryo can't swim! He's being carried downstream! Are you okay, Ryo? - That damn hag... - There are deep spots, so be careful! I had no idea that you couldn't swim. You're not joining them? It's none of my business. Keep your hands to yourselves! He's such a good eater, too! - He sure is! - Hands off, I said! - How is it, Leila? - It's really delicious! This is great! Akito, you’ve got to try this meuniére! I'll pass. Hang on, you don’t hate fish, do you? I can't understand people who eat this stuff voluntarily. What's this, Akito? You don’t eat fish?! - Leave me alone. - Then you don’t eat sushi or sashimi? As if I could eat that smelly stuff. Come on, Akito! This is great! Open wide! - I don’t want any. - Ayano. - Ayano, shove that fish into his mouth! - Cut it out! - It's delicious! - Akito! Are you okay? I'm ready to turn in. Oops! Great Granny! Watch your step. - There are large rocks. - All right, all right. You're a sweet girl, Leila, so I'll do a reading for you. I'll tell you your future. Current preteria futurum... Current preteria futurum... You met a witch in the forest long ago, I see. A witch in the forest? A curse was placed upon you by that witch. A curse... Leila... - Leila... - Mama? Hurry, run... Leila! Do you want to live? If you had power, you could live? I'll make a deal with you. Accept this contract, and while you will live in the world of humans, you will live unlike any other human. A different providence. A different time. The power of the king will isolate you. If you are prepared for it, then use that power. But you are still a child. I will give you until you reach adulthood to make your choice. Once you use it, there will be no turning back. Bu! if you do not; i! will cease Ia exist. That wasn't a dream! The stones say that that power can save him. Save him? Save who? About that... Someone dear to you. Where did Ryo and Yukiya go? Beats me. Maybe they went to gather firewood or something. Can you use such an old PC? I'm boosting its speed with holo-discs. We're in big trouble if you take too long to crack the password. Don’t worry. This will give me the processing speed of a supercomputer. That's my dagger! Were your ancestors samurai? Yeah, they were! That's what my grandpa said. You were born in Europia? That's right. What about you? The same. So were Ryo and Yukiya. I'd love to go see Japan sometime. All of us together. Cdr. Malcal left this with me. She said to give it to you once this operation is over. Why'd she do that? She said it was because I had better odds of surviving. It's a rational decision, but I'd never let my commanding officer get killed. You hold onto it, Akito. That dagger is a talisman. It's supposed to ward off evil if you have it. Then you-- You keep it, Akito. I'm not gonna get myself killed. I always run away, so I don’t need it! - Yukiya, you’re so clever! - He sure is! Our IDs were deleted by someone who infiltrated the army's server. - A hacker? - No one that smart. He's leaving tracks all over, so he's both an idiot and scum. So you recovered our ID data, then? Of course. They were illegally tampered with, so I just restored them. Why is the store so far?! Plus, I left that stupid scum a gift. To teach him a lesson. Your registration info does 7 seem Ia be an file. You saw me when I left! Civilians need to make arrangements through our Public Relations Department. Bastard! What's that mean? You're going back? You're all leaving? Grannies, thank you so much for being so kind to us. - I don’t think that's why. - They're sad to see their slaves go. Grannies, don’t you go senile and forget about us! As if we could ever forget you. Not such a sweet young thing like you! - Yes, his rear is so firm! - Grope away! Grope away, ladies! That's hilarious! - Don’t sit there, dance with us. - Hurry up. Come on! Let's have a good time together. This is stupid. Count me out. Akito? Akito! Leila! - Ryo! - Stay put. Why? Come on, why?! Akito? Can Join you? Akito... I'm afraid. I feel like something bad is bound to happen after times like this. It was like this that other time, too. The moonlight was pretty, and my mother, father, and the entire clan was laughing. Except for my brother. Brother? And then everyone died. I did, too. But I was the only one who came back. When he saw that I had, my brother... Akita... Die. Die! I was supposed to die. I should have died! I should have... I... But then... My brother can't be saved. So I'm... ...going to kill him. Akito... I'm really happy that you survived. I mean, it let me meet you. Is wine all right? Sorry. I'm out of my usual nightcap. How's the husband? Want to see him? Honey, it's Claus. Good evening, Dr. Handle. I heard that it happened during an experiment, right? That's right. Five years ago. The BBS theory is our dream. That we can share will and emotion by resonating brainwaves. That's amazing. I still believe in them. In miracles. - Take care! - Make sure you eat enough! It's a relief to get away from those crazy broads... - I think I'll miss them. - Ryo, are you crying? Don’t be stupid! I bet we'll see them again, Ryo. Commander. I hope we can all go to Japan one day. Caesar's Palace Visitor Parlor However, I found something troubling in recent battle reports. A Europian commando squad known by the code name "Ghost of Hannibal". Lord Shaing, I'm told that you know the details? I encountered them in battle two months ago. Unfortunately, failed to destroy them. "Failed to destroy them," eh? You will assist me... ...Lord Shaing. It's wonderful that you managed to bond with the team. I was a little worried, though. I wasn't sure if you would ever come back. True, it would have been nice to live with them like that forever. But... you came home. Is this one new? The color's different. The components are the same, but the programming has been upgraded. Its movement speed is 30% faster. Oh, you used our combat data to do it? Good eye, Yukiya! Also, we were sent schematics for new weapons from the Barcelona labs. Weapons? Weapons aren't our field of expertise, so we're just following the schematics to build them. We're outputting the parts on the element printer now. New weapons, huh? I can't wait to try them out. Euro Britannian Territory Greenland Hey, old man! How long are you gonna make me walk?! If you stop here, you'll die. If you don’t want to die, shut up and walk. Hey! Is that any way to address me, a knight of the Order of Michael?! Hey! Old man! Don’t leave me! Old man! Old man! Remains of Sakuradite Mining Base Caesar's Palace Operational Command Center To think he summoned the grand duke! He'll trip up soon enough. What is he up to? Announcing His Highness Grand Duke Velaines! Lord Kingsley, if you would be so kind as to begin? There is no need to hurry. We will see results immediately. Unlike you gentlemen. Watch as I drag a spineless Europia, which has avoided all-out confrontation, onto the execution ground that is the battlefield! - Lowly servant! - Restrain yourself, Gaudefroy! Now, let us raise the curtain on the performance. Gentlemen, enjoy the show! Boy, it's cold... Mind if I help myself, Commander? Be my guest. How is it? Oh, it's delicious. Actually, I don’t know much about tea. You said that you encountered a Britannian officer in Slonim? Yes. It was a golden, special-model Nightmare. If that's the case, maybe we should assume that the enemy knows about us. About the ZERO squad? Because the operations we've carried out have had an impact on Britannia. You don’t mean... ...the ultra-long range transport? Using that, we can strike anywhere on the globe. How long are these blackouts gonna last? I'm gonna file a complaint with the power company! They say the North Sea power plant was blown up by terrorists! Terrorists? They say a video claiming responsibility has been uploaded to the net. Hey, is this it? Attention, citizens of the United Republic of Europia. We are the World Liberation Front, the Ark Fleet! Hey, what's this? - Our goal is the true liberation of a people who suffer under the oppression - Go offline! - I can't! - Of foolish polio ymakors. - I can't shut it down! We have destroyed your offshore power plant in the North Sea. Here is the proof. The judgment of the gods will be passed upon those who wallow in foolish culture and live in the tranquility of decadence. Soon, stars of destruction will fall on Paris. Repent and mend your ways! That is the only way that you will survive! They say there was a bio-terror attack in London! It's all over! Burn it! Burn it all! There was an explosion in the Metro! The genocide is beginning! I hear the wealthy are escaping to the New World! Who do they think they are?! Hang them all! String them up! String them up! String them up! String them up! String them up! Do you think this is true? They say there's been attacks in Geneva and Berlin, too. Do you suppose it's happening all over Europia? - There's panic and rioting in the cities. - This is terrible... They say it was set off by the North Sea bombing. Social messaging sites are always full of BS. But there are so many posts! Human beings react strongly to bad news and spread rumors without knowing if it's even true. Right, nothing spreads faster than nasty rumors. Are you saying that someone's deliberately spreading bad rumors? Who would do that? The judgment of the gods will be passed upon those who wallow in foolish culture and live in the tranquility of decadence. Soon... We're getting reports of Eastern Front Forces units that were facing Euro Britannia are retreating. That rabble is using terrorism as an excuse to abandon the front lines! The 40 Man Committee is calling an emergency meeting, but we have intel that assembly members are fleeing Paris. They're despicable! This unrest is gives us the perfect opportunity, General! The people have clearly seen the weakness of the government. Now is the time to make your ideals a reality, General! Greedy capitalists have become a new aristocracy! We must reform the unfairness of a Europia that exploits the masses! The time has come for us to rise up! Please give the word, Gen. Smilas! Burn... Let it all burn... Burn to ash. B-Brother! Daniel! This is terrible! Our banks are being attacked by rioters! My bank! Yes? This is Stefan. There's rioting at the Marseilles factory, too?! I don’t believe it... How can this be happening? Master loan. This arrived. What could he be reporting now? The power plant is still. ...! The ideal tool for controlling people is fear. And nothing overwhelms people more than an unseen fear. Scoundrel. Duke Velaines. Order all your forces to advance. If we march on Europia now, countless innocent civilians will be caught in the crossfire! Innocent civilians? One cannot achieve victory if overly concerned with civilian casualties! Lord Kingsley! His Imperial Majesty is only interested in victory. You do not take his orders seriously enough. No, you harbor rebellious intent. I place you under arrest for treason against His Imperial Majesty. He planned this... Damn you! How dare you treat His Highness in this manner-- Be advised that defying Lord Kingsley is tantamount to treason. I believe that obeying Lord Kingsley's commands for now is in your best interests, Highness. Highness, please give the order. Lord Shaing... Reports say that Clement Industries has been damaged by rioters. Fake stories and rumors are only fanning everyone's anxieties. Leila. I finally found you. Surely you’ve had your fill of playing soldier. It's time to give it up. Britannia is using false intel to rile up the masses. The North Sea power plant is still there! It hasn't been blown up! Britannia is certain to invade under cover of all this chaos. So come home! Right away! Thank you for worrying about me. But I'm looking for a different sort of freedom. Leila! Stupid woman... [mean it; loan. Thank you. It was foolish of Duke Velaines to defy the emperor. Perhaps one could say his time has come and gone? He is under arrest for now, but he will be beheaded before His Majesty. What of the Great Nobles? I doubt that they have the backbone to attack the Britannian homeland. I shall guide Euro Britannia. Checkmate. Well played. You projected the real world onto this game, didn't you? At one point, I would have lost had you only sacrificed your queen. I'm afraid I don’t understand. There are things that you cannot bring yourself to sacrifice. Am I wrong? Everyone possesses such a weakness. A parent, a sibling, a friend. Or perhaps a lover? But I am different. You are? What I must protect, what I am willing to lay down my life to protect, is His Imperial Majesty and no one else! His Majesty... H-His Majesty...! Wh-Who’s there? Who are you?! N-No, I'm different! Th-This... What is this place? Where am I? The Tokyo Settlement? No, Kamine Island? Get out of my head, Julius Kingsley! - Lord Kingsley. - He seems to be out of sorts. I am terribly sorry, Lord Shaing, but I must ask you to leave. When I heard of the Ark Fleet plan, I was reminded of a certain terrorist. The name of a terrorist in Area 11. Lord Kingsley's elaborate plan bears a striking resemblance to one used by that terrorist. No, it is the very same. What are you implying? - He is the rebel, Zero. - Zero is dead! Executed by the emperor! Suzaku Kururugi. The very fact that you, a Knight of the Round, are guarding him proves it. Any further groundless speculation will not end well for you! I respect you, Kururugi. To think that you, the son of Japan's final prime minister, would become the knight of its conqueror... What of it?! It's brilliant. The Order of Michael! Lord Shaing! Is barging into the quarters of His Majesty's emissary with Nightmares the Order of Michael's idea of manners? We're facing a Knight of the Round, but there's nothing to fear! Slay Lancelot and win glory for your family name! Stay calm! It's just one Nightmare! These fools... Don’t let him escape! After him! Kururugi, look around you. At this world of blood and death. This is what you wanted. You're wrong! I don’t want to fight! You are the same as me. You hate the world and have lost faith in humanity. You're wrong! You want to use that white demon and destroy everything, don’t you? You're wrong! You're just like me. Who are you? Who... Your Majesty! What is this place? Where am I? Nunnally... You're the emperor's... Now I see. You're the Eleventh Prince that rumors speak of. The White Devil... I can see the darkness that lies in the depths of your heart, Suzaku. Is that clear? Word of the plan is not to leak out under any circumstances. We will use their assistance as needed-- In all ages, the young always eagerly rush to their deaths. It can't be... Even though heroes are just another dead man. I have no desire to see them dead! Of course. You would never express it in those words. Nevertheless, you are guiding them to the land of the dead. For your own benefit. What are you implying?! We aren't the least bit interested in you making yourself king of this world. However... You did conspire against us once. We must make you atone for that transgression. Atone for it? How? What do you want me to do? In the name of the Geass, I command you. Take Shin Hyuga Shaing's life. Lord Shaing? How do you know about him? I don’t believe it! Is he... That will settle your account with us. If you refuse, we will-- I understand. I will keep my word... You are bound by a contract. Do not forget that. All that matters to us is that the balance of space time is maintained. We do not care who becomes king of this world. Lord Shaing may belong to a noble family, but he was adopted. For him to summon us is the very height of insolence! - Here he is. - That damn Lord Shaing... I have news that I must relate to the members of the House of Lords. I have learned that the man calling himself Julius Kingsley, military advisor of the Holy Britannian Empire, is in fact the rebel once known as Zero. Zero? The terrorist who caused all that trouble in Area 11? But I thought he was executed! All a fiction put together by Kingsley! For that reason, I killed him. Wait, Lord Shaing! You did this without confirmation from the homeland? Did you not harbor discontent towards the homeland? Towards His Majesty? If we openly defy the emperor, it will mean war against the homeland! I suggest you resign yourself to that. To the west is the United Republic of Europia! To the east, the Britannian Empire! For Euro Britannia to survive, its only hope is to fight! What of His Highness?! What does Duke Velaines think?! The fighting has already begun. Please place full authority in the hands of us warriors. Is that the consensus of the Four Great Orders? Unfortunately, the other commanders were afraid to fight and planned to flee to the homeland, I was forced to... - Lord Villon! - Lord Saint-Gilles... Impossible! For Euro Britannia to survive, fighting is the only option! I request the transfer of all of the grand duke's governmental authority and full control over the House of Lords! The rebels are believed to belong to the Order of Michael. It's Lord Shaing. He killed Manfredi. And now means to kill me. We're unable to reach the Orders of Gabriel or Uriel, or General HQ! They were attacked by the Order of Michael? Their commanders must have been killed... Hyuga... You will pay for this. The large-scale blackout in Paris was not caused by a terrorist attack on the offshore power plant. The North Sea power plant is still there, unscathed. What about that video on the net and on TV? An elaborately constructed video file. But the net says there have been attacks all across Europe! All those reports are false. They're using false stories and rumors to whip the people of Europe and set off riots. Then that Ark thing is fake, too? No, the Ark does exist. A giant, flying weapon would deal a powerful psychological blow. However, that is... ...a bluff. A bluff? Just for show? Yes. We believe that it is not equipped with high-yield bombs, and is not an offensive weapon. It is an ingenious plan meant to prey on human fears. To put down the riots, I believe we must reveal the Ark's true nature. You want to use the Wyvern Squad to do it? Yes. But someone who could devise such a devious plan would not have overlooked the possibility of an assault against the Ark. That is why-- Count me in. We have to go. Right? - Of course. - I'm in. I can get the job done by myself. Come again? If you came along, you'd only get in my way. Don’t act so tough! You'll just. . .!! It's obvious what you’re thinking! - S-Stop it! - Let them go at it. Ryo thinks the world of Akito. Anna, would you like some tea? This is delicious. Dr. Handle! - Shouldn’t we do something? - Ah, to be young again. - They're really hanging in there. - But that might be all they have. Even if you’re worried, we'll all come back here together! Count on it! Suit yourself. Brother... Goodbye, Alice. Brother... I love you. Jiyuu tte setsunaku nai desu ka? lsn 7' I! a painful thing Ia be free ? Hitori ni nattan da ne.
