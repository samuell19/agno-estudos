Oh yes, the cage. All right. - Is this it? - There are two compartments as your father asked. You have to separate the turtle doves during the mating season.

And forgive my disturbing your meditation. Have you any word from Mary? She has been gone for three months. - No Joseph, Mary is still with her cousin. - She's surely staying to help Elizabeth give birth. - Do not worry Joseph, Mary is a sensible girl. If she stays, it is because she feels it is her duty. - As soon as she returns we will let you know. - Thank you. - [Narrator] And Mary remained with her for about three months, and then returned to her home. - So, you have returned Mary, was it a good trip? - Very good Deborah, thank you. - Well Joseph, you must be pleased. - Why is that Deborah? - Your betrothed has returned. - Mary is back? - I just passed her. Have you finished my stepladder? - Your, not yet. Come back tomorrow Deborah. - You are eager to see your Mary again hmm?

If your betrothed as is his right, publicly repudiates you, do you know what will happen?

Mary and I are both in the line of David. - Bethlehem? That's twice as far as for us. In your condition in midwinter, it's dangerous Mary. - Yes, it is dangerous. - I'm afraid Joseph, for him. - Such a journey is not possible. We will go to be counted after you've given birth. - No, you heard what he said. You could go to prison. And what would we do without you? Tomorrow we must leave for Bethlehem, it is wiser.

They say they have read in the stars above the birth of a king of the Jews. - Master, all these astronomers are sacrilegious, offending God. - No doubt, but is there not an ancient prophecy that predicts the coming of a king of Israel? - It is so master. It is written. And you Bethlehem in the land of Judea, from you shall come a ruler who is to shepherd my people Israel. - Bethlehem. I would be alone! - We have come to greet the Savior born unto us. (baby crying) - Noble and learned Kings, I greet you. I desired this meeting to hear from your own mouth if it is true that the Stars have revealed to you the birth of the King of the Jews. - It is true Great King. We have come to pay him homage. - So it is. Your science has revealed to you the birth of a leader of Israel. - We have had a sure sign of it. We saw his star at its rising in the east. - You bring great home to my people. Go and search diligently for the child, and when you have found him, bring me word so that I may also go and pay him homage. (slow light music) You! Listen carefully.

(ominous music) (light angelic music) - Mary, the Lord has heard our prayers. (king gasping) - Your Highnesses, the king your father has just rendered his soul to God. (indistinct chatter) - [Narrator] When Herod was dead, behold an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream saying "Arise and take the young child "and his mother and go into the Land of Israel. "For they are dead which sought the young child's life." Joseph and Mary went every year to Jerusalem for the festival of Passover. And when Jesus was 12 they went up as usual. When the festival was over and they started for home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but his parents did not know this. Not finding him, they returned to Jerusalem to search for him. After three days they found him in the temple sitting among the teachers. Listening to them and asking them questions. And all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers. - Hear what Isaiah foretells. A shoot shall spring from the stock of Jesse, the wolf shall live with the lamb, the panther shall lie down with a kid, the lion shall eat straw like an ox, the infant shall play over the cobras hole. - According to you, when will the Messianic time come? And what signs will precede it? - It will come when the eyes of those who look are able to see and their ears to hear. For the prophet has said, "You have looked and not seen, "you have heard and not understood." (indistinct chatter) - Son why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been searching anxiously for you for three days. - And why were you searching for me? Did you not know that I must be in my father's house? - Jesus did not mean to hurt you. - Seeing him every day as I do, I had forgotten. I am such a fool. - Forgotten what Joseph? - Who his real father is Mary. - Jesus loves you as a son loves his father. - He loves. Such a lowly man as I am. - He has eaten your bread since he cut his first teeth. You held him up for his first steps. It was to you he gave his first smile. - Me? Joseph? A simple carpenter. I taught the eternal on high to walk. You mean that Mary? - Yes Joseph I do. - Did you hear how he answered all those learned men? He seemed to be teaching them. At 12 years old. - Pardon me for keeping you waiting. I will go with you. - [Narrator] Then he went down with them to Nazareth and was obedient to them. His mother treasured all these things in her heart and Jesus increased in wisdom, and in years, and in divine, and human favor. - No no no no no no no. No Jesus. Not that way. This way. Keep the plane flat. If you press too hard, the blade will gash the wood. - I understand. - Yes, you understand. You understand everything. (singing in foreign language) - He lived among us and always set an example. He feared God. And now it is Joseph that you go to sleep with your father's. - He would have made you into a fine carpenter. (light gentle music) (loud hammering) The peaches are from the old rabbis garden. I picked them this morning. - The bread you bake is like no other. I would know that smell among a thousand. And the taste. - When must you leave for Bethabara? - Tomorrow at dawn. John is waiting for me. My father spoke through the prophet Isaiah. "Behold, I send my messenger before your face, "which will prepare your way before you." - When Elizabeth was waiting for John to be born, I remember that she was so proud her son would be born before mine. - She was right to be proud. Among those that are born of woman, there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist. - They say he attracts big crowds to the banks of the Jordan. - A considerable number are coming for the baptism of repentance. But I am afraid for John. The Tetrarch has sworn his ruin. And the high priests of Sanhedrin accuse him of sacrilege. - After Bethabara you will no longer work as a carpenter will you? - No. - [Mary] Where will you go? - I will go everywhere to give the good news that comes from God. And tell everyone the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at hand. This is my last work as a man. - [Narrator] John came from the desert where he lived on locusts and wild honey. Then many people came and they were baptized by him and confessed their sins. - [Narrator] Who are you? - I am not the Christ. - [Narrator] Are you Elijah? - No. - Then who are you? Let us have an answer for those who sent us. - I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness who says, prepare the way of the Lord. - [Narrator] If you are neither the Messiah nor Elijah, you're a prophet. Why are you baptizing? - I baptize you with water. But he who is coming after me is mightier than I. Whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with Holy Spirit and with fire! (old man laughs) - Impostor! You are abusing these imbeciles. - You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath that is coming? Even now, the ax is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. - You will end having your tongue cut out false prophet! (John roaring) (slow paced music) - Rabbi, I need to be baptized by you. - Leave it like this for the time being. It is fitting that we should in this way. Do all that righteousness demands. (triumphant music) (slow paced music) - Behold the lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world. - [Narrator] But looking back, and seeing that they followed Him, Jesus said. - What do you seek? - Rabbi, where are you going? - Come and you will see. You, you are Simon, the disciple of John. You shall be called Peter. (men shouting) - Are you the one they call a Baptist? - Yes, I am the one. For I baptize in the name of God. - And I am the one who arrests you in the name of Tetrarch my master. - Your master offends God. He took the wife of his brother Philip and committed adultery in his palace! The stench of his sin rises to heaven! God Almighty, may the palace of this fornicator become a den for jackals! May the body of this sinner rot like a dung hill! - My friends, these are my brothers who've chosen to follow me. This is Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were fishermen on Lake Janessa. Henceforth, they will be fishers of men. This is Philip of Bethesda, and this is Matthew the tax collector, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother. This is Thaddeus. And this is Bartholomew. And he is Judas Iscariot. (singing in foreign language) (indistinct chatter) - [Narrator] There was a wedding at Cana in Galilee. And the mother of Jesus was there. Jesus also was invited to the wedding with his disciples. - As for me Rabbi, I've kept all the commandments since my youth. All of them. I've always paid my tithe, mint, fennel, and carraway. - Then Samuel, if you wish to be perfect, sell everything you possess and give it to the poor. Then you will have your treasure in heaven. - But the thing is, I have many goods and also many children. - You see Samuel, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. (upbeat music) - It's a marvelous feast Jezebel. See how happy your son looks? - He is a good son who has given us great satisfaction. And your Jesus, is he not thinking of taking a wife? At 30 it is high time. - My son's life has only begun. - Ah. Well the important thing is that he be a respectful son. Oh. - They have no more wine. - Woman, what concern is that to you and to me? My hour has not yet come. - Do whatever he tells you. - Fill the jugs with water. (triumphant music) (loud splashing) Now pour it out and take it to the master of this house. - [Narrator] Jesus did this, the first of his signs in Cana of Galilee. He revealed his glory and his disciples believed in him. And it came to pass afterward that he went throughout every city and village preaching and showing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God. The 12 were with him. And certain women which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities. - You see, I am sending you out like sheep into the midst of wolves. So be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. As you go, proclaim the good news that the kingdom of heaven is near. Cure the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons. You received without payment, give without payment. I have not come to bring peace to the earth, but division. I have come to set a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. Once foes will be members of one's own household. Whoever loves father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me. And whoever does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Those who find their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake will find it. (slow paced music) - You are Mary of Nazareth, the mother of Christ? - I am. - May we sit near you? - Come. I am called Mary as you are. I'm from Magdala. I have lived a dissolute life and I have known many men. Your son has taken away the impure spirits that were in me. - I am Susan. I was stricken with the sickness of languidness. Jesus cured me. - I am Joanna, wife of Chuza, Herod's steward. I was driven by pride. I heard your son and he brought peace to my soul. - I am called Salome. I have followed the master since he left Galilee to hear his words. - And who are you? - Judith of Bethesda. I too walk behind the Rabbi. But I'm afraid I'm not worthy of receiving his lessons. I was a prostitute. - One day I heard my son say to his disciples that women who had fallen would go before them into the kingdom of heaven. - In that case, I'm sure to be the first to enter. (women laughing) - Your son speaks sternly of mothers-in-law, is it because he doesn't like them? For I have one in Jericho and she is very nice to me. - Have no fear. My son loves mothers-in-law just as much as other women. - Is it true what they say? - [Mary] What do they say? - That Jesus is not your husband's son. - [Mary Two] Is that any business of yours? - [Susan] Are you not ashamed to spread such gossip? - It is not gossip. - Then, it is true? - It is true. Jesus is not the son of Joseph, my late husband. - Well then, who is the father? - One day, (light music) just as I finished baking bread in my parents house, the angel of the Lord appeared to me and said, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you "and the power of the most high will "conceive in your woman you will bear a son. "And you shall name him Jesus." My son was born nine months later. - Tell us, what did Joseph say? - He said to me, "Mary would you kindly enter my house?" And he loved Jesus. - [Mary Two] May we walk beside you? - Well of course. What woman isn't pleased to walk with her sisters? And just between us, I'm happy for a change of disciples. Men's stories do get a bit weary. - Yes. - [Narrator] The fame of Jesus had spread throughout all of Syria. Vast crowds followed him. Coming from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and Transjordan. And the crowd tried to touch him because a force emanated from him and cured them all. (indistinct shouting) - [Narrator] Just look at me! Just look at me Jesus! Just look at me, cure me! - Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for justice, for they shall be satisfied. Blessed are you, when people persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. When you pray, pray like this! Our Father who art in heaven. - [Crowd] Our Father who art in heaven. - Hallowed be your name. - [Crowd] Hallowed be your name. - Your kingdom come. - [Crowd] Your kingdom come. - Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. - [Crowd] Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. (slow paced music) - What do you want children? - We want to see Rabbi Jesus. - And while you are here who's watching over your sheep? - Jacob stayed to watch them. - Would you like to meet the Rabbi? - Yes we would. - Then go over to him, he's there under the olive tree. He will be happy to see you. Go on. - Hey little ones, what do you want? - To see Rabbi Jesus. - The Rabbi Jesus is resting, you must not disturb him. - She said we could. - Matthew, let the little children come to me. Know this, it is to the like of these that the Kingdom of Heaven belongs. Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as a little child, this same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. - Children, you wanted to see the Rabbi, you have seen him and he has blessed you. Now you must go back to your flocks. - Truly, I say unto you, whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein. - These are for Jacob. To thank him for watching over the Sheep. - What's your name? - Mary. - Mine is Zechariah. - Goodbye Zechariah. Goodbye children. - [Children] Goodbye Mary. - I am the bread of life. Whosoever come to me shall not hunger, and whosoever believes in me shall never thirst. I have come down from heaven to do the will of the one who sent me. That is the will of my father. That everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him, should have eternal life. And I will raise him up on the last day. (crowd speaking) - [Narrator] And the Jews then murmured at him because he said "I am the bread "which came down from heaven." - How can he, the son of Joseph the carpenter dare to say I have come down from heaven? Did you hear? - Isn't he Jesus, Mary's son? What presumption. - In truth I tell you, no man is a prophet in his own land. - Rabbi, your mother and your brothers are outside and wants to speak to you. - Who is my mother? And who are my brothers? Here are my mother and my brothers. For whosoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother. - Jesus said, "Who is my mother and who are my brothers?" - He does not even acknowledge his mother or his family! - My poor Mary, your son has publicly disavowed you! - Well I would say that Jesus is a bit crazy, that's all. - We have nothing more to do here! - They're not wrong Mary. Sometimes the Rabbi does say strange things. - That is true, my son does say strange things. Even I do not always understand. - When he speaks in parables, I racked my brains. - You see Mary, my son is the word of his Father. It is we who do not understand what he says. - He does not acknowledge his family, so be it. Just between us, they're not much of a loss. But you, his mother? Why does he say he doesn't know who you are? - That's between him and me. - Peter, James, Matthew, Thomas, Andrew, and you Judas, come. Who do people say that the son of man is? - John the Baptist. - Elijah. - Jeremiah. - [Narrator] Isaiah. - Abraham. - But who do you say that I am? - You are the Christ, the Son of the living God. - Blessed are you Peter. For flesh and blood have not revealed it to you, but my Father in heaven. And I say also to you, you are Peter. And upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it. I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven. Whatever you loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven. Now, we are going up to Jerusalem and the Son of Man will be handed over to the high priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death. And they will hand him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and scourged and crucified. And on the third day he will be raised from the dead. (slow paced music) What do you want woman? - Must you go up to Jerusalem? - Yes I must. - Why so soon? - Because all that has been written by the prophets about the Son of Man must come to pass. - It seemed like only yesterday that you were a child and I took you to the synagogue. - I will always be your child. (triumphant music) - [Narrator] Glory to the new King of the Jews! Glory to the new King of the Jews! - Do you hear them Mary? The people want your son to be their king. Who would dare to touch him now? - They would. - Quite these people, Jesus of Nazareth! They blaspheme! - They believe you are the King of the Jews! - You should be ashamed! - Verily, I tell you that if thee should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out. - Jesus, just say the word and we will bleed all these Roman pigs to death! You will be our King! (crowd indistinctly shouting) - Look, Caiaphas the high priest. - Even the high priest greets Jesus. - He's quite a sight, the new profit, perched on his donkey. (men laughing) - [Narrator] Every day Jesus was teaching in the temple and the people came to him. The chief priests, the scribes, and the leaders of the people kept looking for a way to kill him. But they did not find anything they could do. For all the people were spellbound by what they heard him say. - Every day the crowds grow larger! - Why have you not brought him? - My men do not dare. The people say, "No man has ever spoken like him." - So, you have also been taken in by him. And your men with you! I ask you, does even one of us believe in this man? - But this crowd, they don't know the law. They believe in him. - What do we do? For this man works many miracles! - [Narrator] Must I have him arrested? - It is not a question of arresting him. But of putting him to death. One man must die so the entire nation shall not perish. - But how? The people say he is a prophet. - He must be made to blaspheme in public, then we can have him and judge him. But not during the festival. An uprising of the people must be avoided. (loud crying) - [Narrator] Get along! - What has this woman done? - Committed adultery! - [Narrator] A bitch! We'll stone her to death! - Where are they taking her? - To a certain Jesus. The false prophet of Nazareth. - Now he will have to tell us if he is ready to obey the law! - [Narrator] Stone her! Stone her! (crowd indistinctly shouting) - Master, this woman has been caught in the very act of adultery. According to the law of Moses, she must be stoned. What have you to say? - [Narrator] They said that to test him. But Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground. - What is your answer? - Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her. Woman, has no one condemned you. - No one Lord. - Neither do I condemn you. Go and do not sin again. Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me. - Ask him who it is. - Lord, who is it? - It is he to whom I shall give this morsel. - Is it I Lord? - You have said so. Do quickly what you are going to do. My dear disciples, I am with you for only a short time. You will look for me, but where I'm going you cannot come. - Lord, where are you going? - Where I'm going Peter, you cannot follow me today. But later on. - Lord, we do not know where you are going. How can we know the way? - I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. - Why can't I follow you now? I would give my life for you. - You would give your life for me? Truly I say, before the cock crows, you will have denied me three times. - Lord, show us the father and we shall be satisfied. - Have I been with you so long and yet you do not know me Philip? He who has seen me has seen the Father. A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another even as I have loved you. By this all men will know that you are my disciples. Take, and eat. This is my body. Drink this, for this is my blood. The blood of the Covenant which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of me. - Why do they want to eat his body and drink his blood? - I have no idea. - Well I'm leaving this place. These people are Pagans. Obviously they're practicing forbidden rituals. (flute music) (foreign singing) - I shall deliver him to you this night. - Where? - In the garden of Gethsemane. He's there every evening. - In the dark, how will we know him? - The one I will kiss is the man. Arrest him. - Here's your payment, 30 pieces of silver. Count them. - Tell me Judas, just why are you handing over your Messiah? - Kiss. - Sit here while I retire to pray. I am deeply grieved, even unto death. Remain here and stay awake with me. (solemn music) My Father, if it is possible, let this chalice pass from me. Nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will. So could you not stay awake one hour with me? The hour is at hand and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. - There are soldiers, they're armed! They're going to get Simone. - See, my betrayer is at hand. - Greetings Rabbi. - You betray me with a kiss. (slow paced music) - [Narrator] Those who arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas. But Peter followed him at a distance as far as the courtyard of the high priest. And going inside he sat with the guards in order to see how this would end. - They arrested him and not too soon. - He's a troublemaker. Sacrilegious, a Nazarene. - He's even blasphemed against the temple. I know, I was there. - Who are they talking about? - About Jesus, that false prophet. - Oh. - You, I know who you are! You were with Jesus the Nazarene. - You don't know what you're talking about. - I'm sure he was with him. - I swear that I don't know the man. - She's right. I saw you in the garden. - I swear, I don't know the man you're talking about! - I'm sure he was with him! (rooster crowing) - [Narrator] When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people handed him over to Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea. - Pilate listen to me. - What do you want now? - I beg of you listen to me. - Don't you think I have enough troubles with these fanatics? - I beg of you, do not meddle in the affairs of this just man. I suffered dreadfully in a dream last night because of him. - Calm yourself. I will chastise him and release him. (indistinct speaking) - Your son has committed no crime in the eyes of the Romans. Pilate will have to let him go. (Mary sobbing) (everyone laughing) - Here is the man. What accusation do you have against this man? - If this man were not a criminal we would not have handed him over to you. - If he is guilty take him yourselves and judge him according to your law. You are the King of the Jews? - Do you believe I am a king or have others told you this? - I'm not a Jew am I? Your own nation and the chief priests have handed you over to me. What have you done? - Procurator, we have a law and according to that law he must die. Because he claims to be the Son of God. - If you release this imposter, you are not a friend of Caesar. - We have no king but Caesar! (crowd boos) - You have heard what they charge you with. Well? - You have said it, I am the king. For this I was born and for this I came into this world to testify to the truth. - What is the truth? It is customary to release a prisoner for you at the Passover. Do you want me to release the King of the Jews or Barabbas? - [Crowd] Barabbas! - But Barabbas is a Brigand! Condemned for murder and sedition! (crowd shouting) Who are you? If you do not answer you condemn yourself. Do you not know that I have the power to release you or crucify you? This man has done nothing to deserve death! (crowd shouting) - My lord, if you persist in saving this visionary you may have difficulties with Rome. Divine Caesar does not want trouble in the provinces. - I am innocent of the blood of this just man. - Mary, what are you doing? - Following him. (suspenseful music) (foreign singing) (women crying) - [Narrator] If you are the son of God come down from the cross! (everyone laughing) - King of Israel, make the nails come out! (everyone laughing) - [Narrator] He has saved others, but he cannot save himself! - Father, forgive them for they do not know what they are doing. Woman, here is your son. John here is your mother. My God. My God, why have you abandoned me? Father, into your hands I command my spirit. (loud thundering) (solemn music) - [Narrator] Now, in the place where he was crucified there was a garden. And in the garden a new sepulcher wherein was never yet man laid. There they laid Jesus. - You two, you will remain on guard all night. And keep your eyes open. You are responsible before the procurator Centurion. If the disciples of this Jesus come tonight to steal the body and proclaim that he lives again, they will not succeed or you will answer for it. You people, you're a complicated bunch. - In a year's time, no one will even remember his name. Mark my words, he'll be forgotten. - [Narrator] The morning of the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene went to the grave carrying arrow mats that she had prepared. She found out with surprise that the stone had been removed. (Mary gasps) - [Jesus] Why are you looking for the living among the dead? Go tell my brother's they must go to Galilee, there they will see me. Do not touch me, because I have not yet ascended to the Father. - Jesus is alive! I just saw him and spoke to him. - He is risen! - On the third day as he said! - I will believe it when I see it. - I saw him as clearly as I see you now! He said to me "Go, tell my brothers, "they must go to Galilee, there they will see me." (singing in foreign language) - Mary! Mary! - [Narrator] From that moment, John the disciple welcomed Mary into his house. Mary, daughter of Nazareth, you who are younger than sin, we know that you are infinitely great because infinitely small. Infinitely joyous, because infinitely sad. Infinitely eternal, because infinitely temporal. Infinitely heavenly, because infinitely earthly. (triumphant music) (light gentle music) (triumphant music) (ominous music) (light music)
