SANTO VS THE FRANKENSTEIN'S DAUGHTER Why did you take so long? Yanco has been asking for you. Has the doctor asked for us? No, she hasn't left her laboratory. This one makes seven. It's seems like Dr. Frankenstein wants to create... ..one living person out of seven dead. Just like her father. One-Eyed! Stop that habit of thinking out loud. It might do you wrong someday. Forgive me, doctor. But you know that I respect her more than anybody. What do you mean you respect her more than anybody? You confuse respect with fear. Yes, I'm afraid of her. Even Dr. Yanco is afraid of her. Aren't you? If it wasn't for that serum she gives us... ...every time we need it... ...we would only be a bunch of miserable specters. Have you forgotten how old are you... ..me, and Dr Yanco? And the rest too? It's forbidden to talk about age in here. The corpse is ready. Prepare the tools to remove the eyes and transplant them... ...to Ursus. Right away. Freda. Did you have to inject yourself again? But it's only been two weeks. Two weeks. Two weeks! The effects of the serum last three months on you. But their duration has diminished in me. That's because I started using it many years before you. My body is saturated. The previous dose lasted two weeks. This one might last for a week. The next one, will last one day and then... ...nothing. You know who is it, right? It's me, thirty years ago, when I started using the serum. Can you imagine how I would look today... ...if it wasn't for the instant mummification... ...producedby the serum? You might think I am defeated, right? Well, no. I am not defeated thanks to Santo. Are you sure his blood will be useful? Yes. Years ago, I saw him fight in USA, A month ago, I saw him fight here. The same agility. The same reflexes. Not a hint of decay. I found it weird. When the fight ended, I pushed my way throught the big crowd. A thread of blood ran down his nose. I cleaned it with my handkerchief. He smiled at me. I came back to the lab and examined that blood. I confirmed my suspicions. His blood carries the TR factor... ...in a proportion a hundred times larger than normal people. My father discovered the TR factor and I isolated it. It's the element that heals the wounds. It renews the organic tissue. When that factor's concentration is as high as Santo's. ...that blood renews the tissues of the body constantly. It means that that body wiIl never get old. It will not die. It will stay young forever. That's why I need Santo. I need his blood! Truxon. He's nervous. Lets go. Calm down. Calm down! That's as far as my work has progressed. Truxon. Half man... ...half beast. Freda, you... Yes I know I've achieved more than anybody. I've transfused the blood of a gorilla into a human being. Watch this. You see the results? A slow, but relentless transformation... ..has occurred in the man. The bestial features and instincts of the gorilla... ..have prevailed despite my efforts. Pretty soon... ...the metamorphosis will be complete. According to your theory... ...he will become a complete beast? That's right. Unfortunately the human species is very weak.. ...compared to the superior vertebrates. That's why I tried with a gorilla. Now, you see the pathetic results. Open the door. But, Freda... Open it! Calm down, Truxon. Calm down. I wont take your food. Keep eating. That's right, yes. Very well. If he obeys me now, is because I have him hypnotized. But soon I won't be able to control him. I can't stop here. I have to go further. My two objectives are... ...first, to bring Ursus to life. A creature built with parts from different corpses. Similar to the creature my father created. And second... ...to catch Santo, ...and keep him by my side forever. El Santo attacks El Toro very harshly. Very famous wrestlers... Don't let him hit you Santo, don't let him! A beautiful flip. El Santo tries to win the round... ..but El Toro is very strong. El Toro makes a great effort. His left shoulder is hurt. A bar. The bar on the leg is very strong. El Santo escapes with a scissors. El Pampero looks for protection. Don't let him get up. don't let him! He throws him against the ropes. Heres the excitement! What a great flip! A beautiful bridge. He repeats the action. El Santo tries to finish him off. Here is his famous lock The horse lock. Referee Bulov tells him to give up. And he gives up. El Santo wins the first round. Bravo, Santo. I love you. Lower the volume. Norma, the neighbors are going to complain. How can you watch the man you love get beaten? He's wonderful. You should see him fight. He just won the first round. He's beautiful, my Santo! I don't understand how can you love a man whose face.. ...you've never seen. When we are alone, he takes the mask off. If you saw him without it, you would also be crazy for him. The second round begins for the finals... ... of the World Medium Weight Chhampionship. El Toro from Argentina is attacking very roughly. He hits El Santo's plexus. That's no way to fight! Dirty swine! Dont let him. love! Don't let him! Get up! He hits his stomach and his plexus. He tries to hurt his lower ribs. What a knee strike! Once again, he attacks El Santos eyes. - For the first time it seems... - Swine! ...he might lose a round. He's hitting him really hard. El Santo reacts. He hits back very hard. That's right, my love. That's it. Come on! They're giving something to El Toro. It's an iron ring Watch out, Santo! Here he comes! El Toro performs.. ...an illegal move, but the referee cant stop him. A tremendous blow! He's hitting him really hard with the iron ring. El Santo has the mouth open. He's stumbling. He's almost knocked out. His legs are weak. El Toro keeps hitting him. The referee intervenes to take the iron ring... ...that has cut Santos face. Once more, on the hurt area. The solar plexus. Santos mask is reddened. He has incredible wounds on the stomach and chest. El Santo is in very bad shape. Finally, the referee is taking the ring. No, he still has it. A weak reaction from El Santo. He's trying to resist, to get some oxygen. Once more, on the face. Seems like Santo's nose is broken. It's impossible for him to recuperate. Not even his supernatural power, could help him win this round. The crowd is anxious. For the first time, it seems like Santo will lose the round... Get up, Santo! Get up! No athlete could bear Toro's unmerciful punishment.. ...such an illegal punishment, The crowd is desperate. El Santo tries to react... ...but it's impossible. El Toro is firm on breaking... ...Santo's unbeaten record, and on passing to the final round. Medium Weight Championship. ..against the Japanese Yamaguchi. Again, El Toro, what a hit on the jaw! El Santo is mangled. The crowd thinks that their hero will not be able to react. - But he does! - That's it! Yes! Bravo! Bravo Santo! Bravo! El Santo has a great capacity to recuperate. The multitudes idol excites his audience. Bravo! There it is. His famous flying kick! A very hard kick on El Toros ribs... ...whose left shoulder is hurting again. He doesnt even move it. El Santo gives it all. All of his fury and his devastating power. That's it, yes! He throws him on his back and goes for the suicidal strike. Watch out! He falls on him! One! Two! Three! Eh Santo wins! He wiil be the contender for the World Championship. Santo! Santo! Time's running out. I need the blood of the Man in the Silver Mask, no matter what. That mission's more difficult than you think. It is difficult to capture that damn masked man. There has to be a way to attract him and catch him. When you investigated him, you said he had a girlfriend. - A girl called... - Norma! She will be the bait. What are you waiting for? I want her right away! Have the generator's ready and watch the manometers. One-Eyed, turn the switch on! Not that one, you idiot! I've told you already the red switch is there... ...to blow up the lab if were discovered. Once activated, even if you disconnect it... ...we would blow up in five minutes. Give more power to the magnetic fields. What are you waitihg for? I said all the power. I didi t! I got it! He lives! I gave's him life! Take the electrodes off. Stop everything now, or you'll burn his brain! We have to go to the place in the note right away. I'm afraid of what might happen to my sister. Calm down, Elsa. I'll go there. Norma will be fine. - Try to calm down. - I can't Santo. I won't until I see Norma. I'll go with you. I couldn't bear staying here, waiting. We'll do what you want. I hope you dont regret it. Lets go. Shes very pretty. Dont you think? Let's go to the lab. We have to prepare the shots for the elderly. I dont want to get lost again. Are we okay? I think so this is the road indicated in the note. All right, gentlemen. When Dr. Frankenstein hires you... ...she applies a serum that'll make you young for three months. After three months, if shes pleased with your service... ...she'll give you a new dose of that serum. But if you fail her... ...the serum will be suspended... ...and you'll be old again. All of us who serve the doctor are in the same situation. None of us is under 100 years of age. Including her. This is confidential. Therefore, we are living, as they say... ...on borrowed time. The doctor is Dr. Frankenstein's daughter... ...the great scientist. A great wise man with whom I collaborated when I was younger. He created the monster that carried his last name. Doctor. Are you here to get injected, Don Elias? You'dont need it. You look very well. Yes, doctor. I come for my shot. I think I'll need it soon. Thank you. You'll feel terrible pain, as though your blood was boiling. But in a short time you'll be young again. I don't see people. It seems like a ghost town. You're used to the noise of the city. There are no night clubs here. POLICE STATlON "SANTA FE" Do you think they'll hear us? Nobody seems to be here. I'm sure they will. The light is on up there. He's very nervous because he's hungry. Dr. Frankenstein gave orders not to feed him... ..to convince El Santo to collaborate. He is a beast in a human body. The human part belonged once to an employee of the doctor. What did he do to deserve such punishment? He disobeyed one of the doctor's orders. He only disobeyed? So what will happen to Scorpio? You can imagine. Thanks to his indscretion. the police almost found... ..the doctor's hideout. Poor Scorpio. Did you call me? At what time will the effects of the serum end in Scorpio? At 11:30. I want all the personnel in the lab at that time. You won't give more serum to Scorpio? No But, Freda... Do you have anytihing to say against my decision? Nothing. Your orders will be carried out. What's going on? Why do you look at me that way? Where is the doctor? Doctor! Where is the doctor? Dr. Yanco, I should get my shot at 11:30. Doctor. The effects will end at 11:30! I need the serum! I'm starting to age. I feel it. The serum. Please the serum, doctor! Theres no more serum for you. No? You said no? Why not? My hands, doctor! My hands, doctor. They are transforming! The serum. Please, the serum! My face! My face is full of wrinkles! Have mercy! I'll do whatever you want. The serum! Forgive me. Forgive me for what I did! I've always been your slave. I'll always be. Give me the serum, please! The serum! Do something for me! Do something! Doctor. Give me the serum. Please. That's the price you pay for betraying Dr Frankenstein. That's why we are in a hurry to get there. I've told you a thousand times, miss... ...that it's very difficult to find a horse here. I suggest you don't travel through the night. Why not? The people of this area say they've heard... ...horrible screams at night on the path you want to take. We should go right away then. She's my sister. You're free to do what you want, but my duty is to warn you. We thank your intentions, sheriff. But we have to be there tonight. Your motives must be really important. Well, you know what you're doing. I'll be waiting for your return. Step back! Step back. infernal beast! Step back! Step back! Calm down or these flames will take you to hell... ...from where you came from! Back! Calm down! Step back! Don't stop or I'll burn your face. Walk! Step back! Walk! Walk! Walk! You'll stay there, horrible beast! It's a hungry coyote. That's why he's howling. If he's hungry, he could attack us. Coyotes only attack in group. They rarely attack humans. They never attack pretty women. Here. - Who is it? - It's me! It's very urgent! Freda, the girl escaped. - Ursus got loose and... - Dont explain anything. I would have to punish too many of them and now I need them all. We brought her anesthetized and she scapes with eyes wide open. If she gets to the city, she'll come back with the police. I will have to use the red swtich. Divide them into thres groups and find her! No, wait! I'll direct the operation myself. We arrived late. She shouldn't be too far. Let's go! Freda! Let me inject you before your transformation begins. Later. I have to endure it. She might appear at anytime. Okay. Yanco. Yes? Remember. I don't care what you do with the girl... ...but I want Santo alive. All right. Run back to town. Santo! I'm really happy to see you. - How did you find me? - You found me. Now we have to find Elsa or have her find us. She insisted on coming with me. You know how stubborn she is. She was very worried about you. I told her to run back to town. Where could she be? I can answer that question. I warn you that if you try to escape... ...I'll blow her head off. Don't be so sure of your triump, ma'am. The sheriff is waiting for us. If we don't get back... Don't trust people you don't know. You could be unpleasantly surprised. Freeze! Or I'll kill her. We have to capture them no matter what. I don't want to think about the doctor's punishment if we don't. We'll say that Santo attacked us. That we are three and still couldn't capture him? Forget it. Let's go. Sheriff. Sheriff! So you are Santo. The famous Man in the Silver Mask. The invincible. The indestructible is here, defeated... ...at the mercy of a fragile woman. I dont think you are fragile... ...nor a woman. You would like to find out. We could be friends. With my science and your skill we would be invincible. With your blood and my formula we would enjoy an eternal youth. Youth, ma'am? Thats why you want my blood? I suspect your face is a mask that hides a horrible old woman. I want to see your face. What a pity, your face. You will regret what you just said. I'll lock Truxon with you. Well see how long does your arrogance last. I want to test your physical strength. Here's the key to the locks. I'll give you the chance to defend yourself. Those screams of pain you heard... ...were caused by the reaction of the mixing... ...of Dr. Frankenstein's serum with my blood. So in exchange for being rescued from old age... ...you become a criminal under her service. The price is minimal for being rescued... ..from old age's loneliness. They're waiting for you outside. Good. Stay here until I get back, and watch her. Dont worry, sheriff. What will you do with me? Dr Frankenstein will decide that. You have to humiliate him. Make him ask for forgiveness. Hit him. Truxon! Beat him, Truxon! Kill him. Truxon. Truxon! Truxon! Kill Truxon and chain Santo. Concentrate. Concentrate. You have to obey me. You'll do what I tell you. Everything I tell you. Concentrate. Concentrate. You'll gouge Santo's eyes out. You will gouge them out. Do you understand? Concentrate. Concentrate. Concentrate. Concentrate! Untie her. Without his eyes, he wont be dangerous anymore. I just want you to bring me his eyes. His eyes only. That will be his punishment for rejecting me. It will be you... ...the woman he loves so much... ...who will carry out my vengeance. With the dagger you will rip them out. You'll bring them to me in the basin I just gave you. Go now and obey. I command you. I'll wait outside. Bloody eyes always give me goose bumps. I had to leave. It reminds me of when I lost my own eye. Norma. Norma! What's wrong? Wake up! You cant do this. Our love is stronger than that woman's wickedness. Norma... Norma! Wake up! One-Eyed will be punished for burning you. Who is it? It's me, doctor. The girl is bringing Santo's eyes. Your mind is powerful, Dr. Frankeinstein. But Norma loves me. Her love broke the chains of your hypnotic force. You'll finish your diabolical experiments in jail. Stop here! I've not surrenderes to your power yet. One more step and in five minutes we will all be dead. My powerful mind will command Ursus to destroy you. Ursus! Destroy him! I command you. Norma, run away! Now! Kill him! Kill him! Kill him. Destroy him. Rip him apart! Kill him! Destroy him! Like that! Kill him! You won't escape alive, Santo! I swear! You don't have much time! Ursus. We'll escape the same way I did last time. Farkas! Sandro! We have to get to town right away. I hope Elsa is all right. The doctor said the whole town is at her service. Lets go! You have to anesthetize the girl and take her to the doctor. Don't you think it's strange that we haven't heard from her? Don't you think Santo...? Do what I say and stop guessing. You're good for nothing! A bunch of imbeciles! They've escaped twice through the same spot. Why did you leave her alone? I assure you that if Farkas and Ursus don't bring Santo back... ...you'll follow Scorpio's fate. I thought the girl was hypnotized. Stupid! Why didn't you stay in there like I told you? I was terrorized of watching her gouge his eyes. It reminds me of when I lost mine. I swear l'll gouge the other one if they don't catch Santo. And you, Man in the Silver Mask... ...I swear to Satan that I'll destroy you! Wait, I think I sprained my ankle. You should rest. It's a slight sprain. It hurts a lot. I'll investigate while you rest. Let me go! Let me go! Santo! Santo! Santo! Let me go! Santo! Let me go! I can see the town's lights. Lets go! My sister! Elsa! Elsa, stand up! - Did they hurt you? - No. You'll talk later. The sun will come up. Lets go! They took the distributor. Bastards! Soon a car will pass by and will take you the city. You are not coming with us? Go to the city and explain what happened to Inspector Martinez. No! Please, come with us. I have to go back to the witch's lair and stop her from fleeing. Tell the inspector to send his men. A car is coming! Would you be so kind to take these women to the city? It will be a great honor to serve you, Santo. You are my favorite wrestler. Next time you see me fight. go to my dressung room. I will be pleased to see you again. Get in, girls. If I don't hear from Santo in an hour, you won't have any serum. Please, calm down! I'm sure Rene will find them in the highway... and will take them to Sandro and his men. Imbeciles! That masked man has a pact with the devil. He's very dangerous. To hell is where you should go. Don'tcome back until you have news from Santo. The sooner, the better for you. Poor miserable man. It's amazing you're still alive after all the blood you've lost. I don't know if you can understand me, but l have to go. I'll come back for you as soon as I can. I know how much youre suffering. ...but that's all I can do for you. The doctor is very interested in seeing you again. Soon Santo will destroy that witch and all of you. You have a loose tongue, and that can be bad for you. You are a coward! You'll regret your words pretty soon, babe. Lets go! Get off me! Doctor it seems like somebody is in the secret tunnel! I know It can't be any other than Santo. - Tell the men to be prepared. - Yes, doctor. Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Freda. Each time the pain gets more intense. That could perturb her mental capabilitles. I hope I'm not here when that happens. You can live with a mad person if you know how to handle them. I don't think you'll be able to do it with a rope on your neck. Lift him up. Lets go back. I don't like this place. Your sister caused Ursus' death when she helped Santo escape. My work of years was ruined because of you. No! No! Dont do it! No! No! I'll start her punishment by gouging her eyes out... amd them I'll fill her eye sockets with acid. Her pain will pay in part Ursus' horrible agony... when he fell over the cross. Open it. He's dead. Santo! Do something, Tanco! Don't move, or pretty soon you won't recognize her face. It's sulfuric acid. One more doubt, and next time I'll spay it on her face! Ursus, destroy Santo! That's why Lucifer sent you here. Attack her Ursus. Shes responsible for your horrible life. No! Not me! After him! Kill him! Get away, beast. You have to attack Santo. I command you and you have to obey me. No Ursus! Ursus! No! Run! Everything will blow up! Follow us Ursus! This way, Elsa. Freda! Freda? Freda? Freda. Let's go! Follow me! Let's go let's go! Hurry up girls! Hurry up! We've got to get away from here. Everything will blow up. Santo! Santo! The multitude's idol, El Santo versus the Japanese Yamaguchi. It's the first round. We are seeing the first moves, full of action. What a beautiful flying scissors from El Santo! He repeats it, and the crowd is with him. Lets go! Great physical condition show by the great athlete. El Santo, the Children's Friend. The Japanese is also a great athlete. El Santo is easily dominating the Japanese Yamaguchi. Here's a strike. Watch out! El Santo rolls nicely. Now he prepares his flying lock. Which has made him so famous. The world's idol is completely dominating Yamaguchi. who's also beimg applauded for his chivalry. Big blows! El Santo is hitting him hard. Here's a hammer combination. The referee Bulov asks if he will give up. But look how easily El Santo escapes... from the attack to his leg. Yamaguchi goes after him El Santo wraps around his waist and looks for a lower lock. He traps him with a bar. Here, El Santo smiles at his crowd. And the horse lock! He's got him trapped. The Japanese gives up and El Santo wins the first round... of the World Medium Weight Championship. The crowd is happy They are all with him. "Hoorays", left and right. You can hear "Santo", "Santo" all around the arena. The crowd is happy. I hope their dream of El Santo becomimg... the World Medium Weight Champion comes true. We are on the second round. He gets a good hold of the waist for the "nelson". A "kosamagi" from the Japanese. Yamaguchi traps him using a tough lock on the neck. Once again, the lock. El Santo escapes very easily. It's amazing. A beautiful change in locks. Watch out, Santo. They want to apply the crab on him. He rests his right knee on Santos' back. El Santo has freed his leg! He gets rid of him very easily. El Santo, the Defender of the Weak. He's looking for a "nelson". Another combination of locks. Yamaguchi escapes very well from Santos neck hug. But there's the flying scissors again. They make Yamaguchi flip around spectacularly. Over and over again. He has him at his mercy. The crowd is very excited. They love to see their idol triumph over. the very dangerous Yamaguchi, who sometimes looks desperate. He's perfomed some great moves, like this hammer on the arm. A hard lock that El Santo resists and manages to escape... with a Japanese lock. The "kosanagi" and now the whip! And here we expect the tragic brldge. What a big blow to Yamaguchi! El Santo shows his great physical shape... But he's been caught in a lock. This is the first illegal move from Yamaguchi. Completely desperate. He hasn't been able to control the multitude's idol. He wants to repeat it, but look how agile is Santo! Now, El Santo will finish him off, with the famous "crotch"! The crowd is screaming. And to please them; The suicidal strike. Here it is!
