Drenches the soil, slowly from the sky. Fills the sky, steadily as vapour. Like the floating rains or a flowing river Like the ever turbulent sea. Water, your great journey.. Grasses, flowers and humans are awakened because of you.. However ancient you may be, you always stay unique.. Water! Water! Water! If you come to our campus & hit our students, should we stay silent? It was your students who started it. Radhika is his girl. Ask this stammerer to speak normally first. Is his stammering the problem here? Won't you understand if he stammers, idiot? Didn't you get enough? Radhika is his girlfriend. Knowing that, why is he going behind her? Who? I don't want to get beaten anymore. It's going on since morning. She might be confused because she's blind. Let's go ask her. Radhika! What's the problem? Sorry. We didn't mean to disturb you. Asmall m... Missing? Massage? Message? Maintenance? Misunderstanding! You and your bloody English. I can't speak English. I'm leaving. This idiot Sanju is saying that you are his girlfriend. You can say boldly, that you're in love with Nelson. I myself have seen you many.. You've seen her many times at many places, right? Many times! So all this drama was for that? I don't like Sanju. I don't like Nelson as well. But whatever you said is true. We've hung out together. But it's not because I love him or anything. I just used the chance I got, very well. To get to know about him. Him? Who is he? It's you. To get to know more about you, I needed someone like him. Why should you get to know about me? Why should you get to know more about him? Because I like him. I like you! I'm all confused! You keep going to the gym &tattoo yourself. If you had a stammer, you'd have been lucky! Hey! Just a minute. I'm another guy. Do you really like this idiot.. I mean, this stammerer? Just think about it properly. I may be blind; But I can say that you're very em barassed rig ht now. That's rig ht. Is Nelson here? He is here. Nelson, I'm really sorry. The other team? - They're behind you. I'm very sorry. I'm late for the rehearsals. You're all leaving, right? Shekhar, We'll meet later. Let's go. Dude, we guys.. Move! We guys go behind each girl, fill petrol, buy everything that they need, we won't even get time to put our purse back in our pocket. And now when an offer has come to him without any expense, don't try to spoil it! - Can you please stop? You're going on and on! Are you sadder than him? I am sad. You're not getting anything and you're not letting him have it either; And I'm getting nothing at all. I'm really sad. She might not like me today. But there's a chance tomorrow, right? Is this a lottery ticket or what? To keep announcing that it's tomorrow? I don't want anything that you don't like. See! He feels bad. Dude! Do you seriously like her? Then tell me! I don't have any problem. If you're happy, all of us would be happy. You sure? He's not saying it just because he's drunk. His word is final. Got it? You won't change it later, right? Don't change it. I've also started stammering. Bro, you have a blast! There's no problem at all! Dude, you look really good. I swear! Then why should you go behind blind girls? Hey. He agreed! Shekhar? Who agreed? N.. N.. Nelson! Nelson? I can't do anything by upsetting him. But now he has given permission. We can start now if you want to! Who is he to give permission? My dad? I just said that I like you. Doesn't mean we gotta go around rig ht away. Are you making a fool out of me? In front of all of them, you said that you like me, not him; Okay. Why are you getting angry now? Who's getting angry? I just said what happened. Okay. Why have you come to meet me now? When a girl looked at me and said that she liked me, for the first time in my life; I got curious. Curiosity over? You may go now. Let things get set for that bro over there. You can't see me walking away from here, right? I'm walking away from here, really furious! Fine. Leave. Well, Shall I ask you something? Even if it is me, or Nelson; What's the difference for you? You can't see the person anyway, right? Shekhar, Even you have, a manufacturing defect, right? How much ever you stammer while talking, your voice is heard the loudest. Even if you get stuck in between, you don't mind all that; You will finish saying whatever you want to say. On that day, right from the time I heard it for the first time; I noticed your voice. After that, do you know how many times I've come behind you just to listen to that? Hearing it again and again, I liked it very much! I think I made a mistake. I didn't think about this disability of mine. It will be like this, lifelong. If you think this is a problem for you, tell me right away! What's that for now? In. This is the only way how I know to say sorry. I'm sorry too. Why? Radhika! Radhika! Radhika! Why isn't anyone saying anything? Then you start talking. Nam aste. As the eldest among the groom's friends, I don't have any objection in their marriage. I approve of it! Hey! Who are you? I came along with the groom's friends. What's the hurry for marriage now? Exactly. You're not old enough to get married yet. You haven't even completed the course you're studying. Rad hika, think about your career. Even if we get you married, how are you going to live? I'll take care of that. But we cannot go ahead like this anymore. How'? Without getting married... Try to settle down in life first. Let them get set first & then settle down. Only after that, we can get set. Hey! Didn't I tell you to keep quiet? You didn't tell me to keep quiet. You asked me who I am. Get lost! - I won't. No way I'm going to get my sister married to a jobless loafer like him. You're talking as if we are in a hurry for this marriage? We're not at all interested in this. Watch your words! Don't raise your voice! Shall we tell them the truth? Not now. Don't raise your voice! This is a public place. Who are you to tell me not to raise my voice? We are going to have a baby. Now we can get married, right? Didn't I tell you not to tell them? - Who's crying? - Your mom. Now they can get married right? Leave me. He is coming to hit me. This time I'm going to hit him back. No. I love you. Aren't you ashamed to get beaten up for romancing around? You can't even take care of yourself properly. How are you going to take care of this blind girl and her baby then? Don't mind it. Even last week, he came to the hospital and took money from me for petrol. You're still a child. You're not fit for all this. Why are you spoiling her life as well? For you, I'm still like a kid in 8th grade. Your eyes haven't seen that I have grown up. Even though she's blind, she can see that. That's enough for me. Okay then. Carry on then. They left. It's nice to hear whatever you're saying. But are you actually going to live with this blind girl, bro? I just said that in a flow. But one thing is for sure. Whatever happens, I want this blind girl with me. Bro! Who is she like? Like me. Be serious. Is she like you? Eyes are like mine, even the nose; And hair all over her head, just like me. But. All the beauty is yours. Actually, she's even more beautiful than you. Then, Say sorry to your pretty baby immediately. Sorry, my baby. As soon as you were born, dad had to leave without telling anyone. It won't happen again. Really.. Really sorry. Hereafter, I would never leave you both and go. Promise! Radhika Srinivasan? Dr. Geetha's patient. Radhika finished her tests and left with her brother. With her brother? Yes. With her brother. What are you doing here, Chechi (sister)? I asked her to com e. Geetha is my batch mate. She called me when she found out that it's your case. What's the matter? Com e. We need to talk. Radhika wasn't blind since birth. Do you know that? Yes. She had sight until she was 10 years old. Why are you talking about this now? There's something that you don't know. Radhika's child's pre-natal test results are out. What test? According to that, her child also has the same disease. If Radhika lost her sight when she turned 10, her child will lose her sight within 7 or 8 years itself. Since this is a genetic disorder, it cannot be cured. But Madam.. In Radhika's present health condition, we can't do an abortion. Does she know about this? I already talked to her. She understood everything. It's good that we found this now itself. What if you found this out only after the wedding? We can fix a good amount as a compensation. Which will cover all the expenses. Don't worry at all. I'll take care of everything. Why are you unnecessarily taking upon the burden of her & her child? If you live with these patients, you would also end up having some disease. Let her mind her own business. Let her and her child do whatever they want! Our child! What? That's my child as well. Stop shouting & get lost! - What can I do if my sister said so? - Get out. This is our life. It's a matter which affects us and our child. It's us who have to take a decision. Who are these guys to interfere in that? This is about me and my wife. What wife? For that, have you married her yet? Get out! She is going to be the mother of my child. That's enough for me to claim her as my wife. You get lost! Radhika! Shekhar! Leave from here. Inna If you utter even a word more, you won't be able to see me after this, ever. Radhika! Just go! Radhika! Radhika! I am like you now. I have blindfolded both my eyes. To see the world that you cannot see. It's true! It's all dark here, and it's fully black. My world without you, will be darker than that! If this ability to see, which you and your child don't have, separates me from you; I don't need it! I don't need it for my whole lifetime! If you both don't need me, then so be it! But I need you both! I need you and our super cute daughter who is yet to be born. I forgot to tell you. I am sure! We will have a daughter. If you try to avoid me, I would keep chasing you. Until you change your mind and come to my house, I won't leave you, dear! Radhika! Radhika! I will come. Both of us will come. Take us with you. As my sight started diminishing, dad realized that there was nothing left to be done. He decided to take leave for a year. To go on a long journey with me. Just me and dad. The thing I liked the most during the trip, Our car broke down at a beach side while we were going to the airport. Dad was busy with that. I walked slowly and went to that beach. And stood there watching the waves. After some time, I got scared for no reason. When I turned back, My dad was standing right behind me. We just sat down there. Without speaking anything. That's when I realized, wherever I go, my dad will always be with me. Then we shall go too! Where? To that beach. Who will take me? You? If your dad can take you there, I can take my daughter there. We will also go to the same beach; And sit there for a long time. Just that no one should come and disturb us then. Will you take my daughter there without me? Why not? What if she cries? There's a small stammer while she's crying, like you. She would definitely not have that. What if she has it? Would your love for her decrease? When she loses her sight, you won't need her anymore? I will just love her even more then. If you had called Packers & Movers, they would have done this easily. If I had done that, I wouldn't get this pleasure. I didn't know pleasure was so heavy. At least buy us snacks after making us toil so hard! That will break, Pattoo. What? She said that it would break. Be careful, you idiot. How does she understand all this? She understands everything. Then you can't enjoy looking at girls anymore, huh? Even if you do, I will find out! Shekhar! Shekhar! MBRHDRG! Nothing will happen. We'll be there in no time. Radhika! Juhu beach in Bombay. Marina in Chennai; Kovalam in Kerala; There are many beaches in Goa; You didn't tell me which beach it was! Shekhar! I want to go to all the beaches. With you, and our child. I love you! I always feared whether you would leave us. But now, I myself have.. I'm sorry, Shekhar! I'm sorry, Shekhar! I'm so sorry. Without you, how will our baby and l.. You both should be happy. I like you. Lifelong, will you be able to live with this blind girl, bro? I love you! I love you! Love you too! Dad! Oh cool breeze, that caresses me slowly. She who comes raging as a striking storm" As breaths and sparks, you sustain the flame of life, without extinguishing. When wind ceases, they are just coffins. Wind! Wind! Wind! Shit! Shit! Are you ok? Quick! Come here. - Jusfin! - She's still breathing. We can take her to the hospital in an hour. We have boozed, man! If we take her to the hospital now.. I'll drive then. Listen to me. No need... Quick, open the car door. Trilok. Justin, Annie shouldn't know about this. I raised her without her mother. If she knows this, she'll be shattered. Don't be tensed. Nothing will happen to the girl. Call Dr. Tresa. And tell her what happened. If we take her to the hospital in this condition of ours, won't the police charge a case against us? It's a non-bailable offense. Your wedding to Annie would be canceled. And I'll go to jail. Do you want that? What are you asking me to do then? We never came this way. Nothing has happened to her. We'll reach the hospital in half an hour and we can save her life. Didn't I say no? Stop the car! Let's leave her somewhere on the road here, Jesus will take care of this girl. Jesus would never forgive us. Look at her. She's still breathing. Won't you obey if your dad asked you? I can't, uncle. God would never forgive me. Didn't I say no? Stop the car. What if this had happened to ourAnnie? Is this girl's life more important to you than my daughter? Stop the car. Stop the car! Uncle, look... I think she stopped breathing. Those who cry, call Your name, Those who are in sorrow, depend on You; Console your follower with your promises; The Lord of life and death; Didn't Sunny's father too die due to a heart attack? This is his first attack, right? He has left all of us and gone away. I'll take care. Grandma, come on. Come with me. I'll bring your food inside. See. See howmuch he loves grandma. Even her own children wouldn't have given her this much love. I thought Papa would object to me and Justin getting married. But he was never able to say no to any of my wishes. He raised me by pampering me a lot. But when it comes to business, both of them won't say anything to me. Papa always said that our problems should remain within ourselves. Even though both of them love me more than their lives; When they get together, I'm always left out! Do you know what all they have done without me? Isn't it, Justin? Hello? Good morning, sir. Where did you reach? - Just crossed Chalakudy. - Chalakudy? I'm almost there. Call the agent and ask him where he has reached. Sir, is he there yet? I've been waiting for half an hour. No one has come. I'll wait for 5 more minutes. After that I'll go my way. Got it? Hello. Enough! He's quoting an expensive rate to fool us. Don't attend his calls again. Got it? Even othen/vise, who's going to buy a plot at this Godforsaken place? Justin, I've left from Mathew Uncle's ho use. Where are you? I'll take two more hours to get home. Father Abraham has given 10th as the date for the baptism. We should go there and discuss things with him. What about daddy's insurance? There are some more formalities to be completed. I'll call you. What happened? I said I'll call you back! Justin? My God! Are you ok? Cover your face. Hello. J K hospital? Accident case. Critical. I'll be there in 20 minutes. Hey! Stay awake! Come on! Hey! Stay with me! Stay with me! Nurse! Doctor! Where is the duty doctor? Attend to him immediately! Who's the surgeon? Is it an accident case? His rib cage is 90% damaged. Immediate surgery is required. Sir, we're not allowed to register accident cases. Get him admitted. I'll do the necessary formalities. Bring those papers! Sir, your name? Trilok. Trilok Menon. Justin, don't move too much. Doctor has said that you'll be in pain for a week more. Where is he? Who? The person who admitted me here. Oh! Dr. Trilok? He left only after the operation. He came yesterday also. He said he'll come today also. You want to talk to him? I don't want to see him. Why? I want to go back home quickly. As soon as I can be discharged from here. Does he know where our house is? Justin, what happened? Understand what I'm saying! Didn't I say that I don't want to see him? Justin, what's wrong? - Madam! That angry Vet Doctor has come. Shall I send him in? Is he still on sedation? Didn't he wake up yet? No. He just had food &went to sleep. He's in a lot of pain. Don't worry about that. It will be all right in a week. But he must definitely take bed rest for 2 months. You know he was this close? If I was late even by half an hour, we would have lost Justin. It was Lord Christ who sent you there at the right time. I don't know how to thank you. 4 years back, when my wife was hit by a car and lying on the road, God didn't send anyone to save her. If she was taken to the hospital on time, she would have survived. But nobody cam e. She wasn't as lucky as Justin. Or else she would have been with me now. So I don't believe in God. I'll call you, Annie. Justin, what happened? Justin, what happened? Tell me what happened.. I did a mistake. To be precise, I helped in doing a big mistake. Uncle, come fast. She's still breathing. We have boozed, man. If we take her to the hospital now, Let's leave her somewhere here and go. Jesus will save her. Hello! - Trilok? Ya Annie. Busy? I'm trying to tame a son of a b**ch. A stubborn Great Dane is not having his medicines. What's the matter? Can you come here? No. Justin wants to meet you. I was anyway going to come in the evening. Okay. I'll come right away. I'll be there in one hour. See yo u. Any change in dosage today? It's the same. Trilok has come. Are you sure about this? Ya. I'm not staying. I don't know how to face Trilo k. You go home. I'll call you. Phew! Finally I saw you awake. How are you Justin? How do you feel now? Better. Sir, I don't know how to thank you. You shouldn't be thanking me. You should thank Daler Mehndi. I got irritated hearing his song and switched off the stereo. That's when I heard you shouting. Annie is not here? I want to say something to you, sir. I don't know how you would react. I know your wife. How do you knowAisha? The car that hit Aisha, Annie's Papa was driving it. I tried to take her to the hospital. But on the way itself, she lost her life. I didn't have any other option to save Annie's father. We had to leave her on the road and escape. After that incident, I've never slept in peace. I always think about. Did someone bury her? Are her parents still looking for her? I wanted to contact her family several times. But I didn't have the courage. However much I apologize, it won't be enough. I know that. It's fate that brought you in front of me. Are you able to move your hand? I asked, are you able to move your hand? It's partial paralysis. I doubt if the dose was less. I couldn't mix it fully outside. That nurse was too irritating. She kept bugging me. Just 20 more minutes. First you'll lose your voice. Then it will be difficult to breathe. Without oxygen, the heart will stop beating. It will all be a big blur. I had mixed 30 ml in your father-in-laws food, just like this. But before I could finish talking, I want to watch you also dying, live. Me and Aisha were settled in Bangalore. Since it was a Hindu-Muslim marriage, our parents never wanted it to happen. After our marriage, it took one year to settle the problems with our families. Honeymoon didn't happen. It was after planning for a long time, that we came here. Aisha doesn't like hill stations at all. But it was me who forced her to come here. After the accident, I didn't go back. I started a small clinic here, and began practice. I had to survive until I found you, right? Me, who was a doctor; Became an expert in cars by then. While jamming your brake shoe, there was only a 50-50 chance for your death. It happened exactly as I had wished. You survived. You might be thinking now; Why did I try to save you if I wanted to kill you; If you wanted to throw my Aisha on the road, why did you try to save her? I found out which car it was with just the tyre marks. I found out how many people owned that car. Hello! Is it James sir? It's Sunny. Is this Gireesh Kumar sir? Mr. Charles? Sir, I'm Suresh. From General Bank. By checking one by one, I deleted each name on that list. Until I found the right person. - Can you tell me the details of your car? - What details? If we send a customer feedback form, would you fill it up? BMW. 525D. I inquired which family among them had the same model car. Just to confirm that it was Ponkunnel Thomas Zachariah's family, it took 3 years. After hearing your father-in-laws voice over the phone on that day, I was sure that I hadn't gone wrong. Now hang "P! I came and stood at your doorstep. I saw the faces those voices belonged to. The voices that didn't let me sleep for all these years. I heard. I heard clearly. Both of you talking. And my Aisha dying bit by bit. Justin, Annie shouldn't know about this. We never came this way. Nothing has happened here. If we take this girl to a hospital in this condition of ours, won't the Police charge a case against us? It's a non-bailable offense. Your wedding to Annie would be canceled. And I'll go to jail. Let's leave her somewhere here and go. Jesus will save her. Even after you crashed on to her, she was alive. Even after your father-in-law brainwashed you saying that Jesus would save her; She was alive. Even when he threatened you asking if she was more important than Annie, she was still alive. You left her on that road and went away; But until I reached there, she stayed alive. I decided on that day; Even if it takes my entire lifetime; Even if I had to go to any corner of this world; I will definitely find you both! Like my Aisha lost her life bit by bit; I would take your lives too! A long wait has come to an end now. The good heart that you had to confess everything; I appreciate that. Makes me feel, you're a good man. But not good enough. If you were so, I wouldn't have lost my Aisha. Bye Justin. AfterAisha's post-modem, I was told that that her left brain was completely damaged. Her rib cage was shattered. Both her legs were crushed. She lost 90% of her blood as well. But I was completely shattered, when I came to know that she was pregnant. When you agreed to your father-in-law; You didn't kill just one; But three lives. Do you think that we need a child now? You are there for me, right? That's enough for me. I'm asking you seriously. You think we are ready to start a family? My family, my life, my world, It's all you, Aisha. Hello! Where are you off to? It's a forest. There will be bears & tigers here. Then catch up! Oh! Is that so? Okay. Then untill catch up, let me sing a song. Your favourite Daler Mehndi! Shut up! When it burns, it wakes the world and stirs your soul. When it burns, it thrives the light of life through the glowing sun. Even when it flames away the mortal sins of human emotion, Let you flare high universally, with an inventive lease of life. It's our mistake that we got you married to him, trusting him. Why are you wasting your time talking to him, brother? Shiva, get the suitcase and come. You should not stay here for a second longer. Shiva, com e. Let's go. Shiva! If you leave from here now, that will be the end of everything! You won't be able to see them or even their shadows in this life. Siddhu! Siddhu! Mom! Have you come here to feed goats or what? Why can't you pick up when I call? Come up! Come! I'm coming. Calm down. Smile! See you! I don't have to take the corpse to the hospital to confirm the death. I can judge whether he's dead or not by seeing him trembling. And I've never gone back without finishing a job I've taken up. Did you send the photo to Seth? I sent it long back. Got a blue tick too! If I take up a job, I don't delay it. Have you seen a porcupine? Porcupine! Why, dude? Tell me! With a plaster on its hand, it will look exactly like you. If you keep talking like this, I'll take up the contract to kill you myself. Then do at least that and stop hogging on others' cash. Get lost! Hey! Stop it! Listen! You don't have to kill the guy. Just take his arm or leg. Okay. Got it! Did you hear him? You heard him right? Let's get going! This doesn't work. (Sings actor Sathyan's song) Hey! Hey! Sing Prem Nazir Sir's song, man! Oh God! (Keeps singing Sathyan's song) If you don't know, don't sing! You sing only Sathyan Sir's songs or what? (Sings actor Prem Nazir's song) Enough of your screaming! He's not going to die! Hello! Yes. When? I'll come! Hey! Come Shiva! Hey Handicap! Come, let's go! It's your daddy who's a handicap! @$@g He won't let me complete anything. Is there a dog in this house? If you have one, don't give this to it. It Will die. The food was that terrible! Smile! Sir, are you coming for dinner? You carry on. I'll come. The boys messed with a big team, Bhadra. That boy is still in the hospital. They broke his skull. That too, right in the centre of the college. We haven't registered an FIR yet. You can take him if you want to. Even if it's out of his range; Don't you know he's our brother? Couldn't you call us before you roughed him up, you pig? Or, were you messing with him knowingly? Nothing has happened, right? I'll see to it that it does not become a case. You shouldn't have laid your hands on him. We're keeping his pocket happy, right? Stop m Sir! Hold him! Catch him. Stop him! Leave him! Listen to me. Leave him! Didn't we tell you not to raise your hand? Didn't we? It wasn't wrong to hit him, son. But the place; That went wrong. Shouldn't you have hit him where no one was around? You should learn from your elder brother. Shiva! He beats everyone to pulp! You can be like your brother! It's no big deal! But, everything needs to be done at the rig ht time, brother. From tomorrow, you can come to our den with them. Want some? Or you want this? You were justifying him all this while, right? You can ask him yourself. Ask him where the hell he was for the past 3 days? Looks like sister is really furious! Are you packing your bags & leaving? You don't even have the time to see if I'm still alive here. Goons, it seems! Why have you come here now? There's no one who's close to you here. I'm leaving! Wondering whether he's lying dead somewhere, I was going crazy here. Rukku, stop shouting! Do you think we're nursery kids for someone to bump us off? Shut your mouth! Shiva! There's a knife inside. I'll slice you & leave you to the dogs. Get lost from here! If you come anywhere near here, I will burn you alive! Get lost! Where are you taking my child? Open the door! Open the door, I say! To hug & pamper her, she's not your child! She is my Ammu! Do you think you can throw me out and live peacefully with my child? I won't allow that! Open the door! I know very well that you're tolerating me because ofAmmu. I know! It's because of your love for her, that you felt pity for me and brought me here. Now you both are in, and I'm out? ODE“! She is my child. Wait. Don't you want me Shiva? Even after hearing me shout like a mad woman here, couldn't you ask me what's wrong? At least beacuse I'm feeding you everyday, right? At least because of that gratitude, you could have asked me. Go ahead! You also become like your brother. Hey! Ask your brother to come for dinner in the night. I will be waiting. Call you later. Hello! We'll reach in 10 minutes. Okay. Why are you giving me that scary look? Bhai asked you to come. Not me. Let's go! Sir, how long do you want us to wait? Wait. He will be here any minute. No one knows who is the culprit. If you ask the right way, they'll say it. ACP is on his way. We can't keep the body here any longer. He's here, right? Dad? Dad! Dad! Dad! Get lost. All of you get lost. I don't need anyone. Shiva, please take your brother away from here quickly. OthenNise your dad will beat him to death. Dad! Dad! Go! All of you, get lost! First your mom left me. After that, you left. Now take him away as well. Get lost! I don't need anyone! Get lost! He came here like he always comes. He had 3 rounds of rum. Someone came and sat next to him. He kept talking for a long time. Suddenly, he took out a gun and shot him, sir. Do you know him? Can you identify him? What sir? Can you recognize that guy if you see him? He hasn't come here earlier sir. I don't think he's from our city. Sir, if we check the CCTV camera, we can find something. Keep quiet. Hey! What is he saying? Nothing, sir. Just like that. Answer me! If you check our CCTV camera, you might find him, sir. I don't know anything else. His photo should reach all our boys. Only after we finish him, we'll do anything else! His name is Vishnu. He is from Bombay. He has a transport company in Bombay for the sake of it. He keeps visiting Kerala, Tamizh Nadu & Karnataka twice a month, with that excuse. Not just transport, all his deals are fishy. He escaped to Bombay yesterday. But whatever we need to know about him, we've got it from this guy. Shiva! Finish them all! Shiva... How come this sudden love for your dad which wasn't there until now? Shiva! Didn't I tell you not to go? I'm scared, Shiva. I'm really scared. Me, Ammu, and our child who's growing in my womb, we don't have anyone else! Don't Listen to me, Shiva! Shiva! Shiva, you understood whatl said, right? Finish all this fast, and come back here soon. I'll take care of the rest. The bus will halt half an hour for dinner. Hey! Did you ask him to come? Move! What are you doing? Prabha, take him away! If you don't listen to me after coming there, I'll rip you apart. Go inside! Vishnu! Like his name; A man of God. His actual business is in Dubai. Hey! You will teach me business? Shall I tell you what your margin is? I know very well how to break into your house and get the money from you. My; Neelesh's 15% is coming. You guys leave. It won't happen today. Come tomorrow From the ruling party to the opposition, everyone is connected to him. He isn't any little chicken. Hey! Come here. Looks like she is Bhai's 'set up'. Why do you want to take someone else's trouble upon us? Don't poke your nose into unnecessary stuff. Vishnu's original business is in Dubai. What's happening? But it's not that easy to finish him. That's all? That man was speaking for so long! He said just what we need to know. These bloody Mad rasi people would say whatever, and you'll screw up your business like a mad dog? I don't want these guys in my house. How many times have I told you, don't poke your nose into my business! You mind your own business! And let me do mine! Got it? Can you get him or not? They are asking whether we would be able to do it or not. It will be done. But it will take time. He is leaving to Dubai tomorrow We can do something only after he comes back. He is going to Dubai tomorrow. We can finish him after he comes back. No way! We have to do it either today or tomorrow. Tell us whether you can do it or not. We know how to do this. - Exactly! They are saying that. Tomorrow is the last day of his Pooja (Prayer meeting). If you want to kill him, this is the only chance. What is this bloody devil saying? Tomorrow! Stay silent! Don't even breathe! Stay inside until we tell you. Got it? Any sound comes out of this, I'll break all your bones. Okay. He's gone upstairs! Chettaa! (Brother) I had warned you not to do it! Don't screw up our business! I had warned you! Which room is vacant? - That one. - This one? - Is it vacant? Now you can keep running or hiding, lifelong! Everything will be all rig ht in 2 days. - Shut up! If you say anything more, I'll break your face. Take him inside. Com e, Bhai. Come in. Don't give out any room on rent today. Don't pick up any calls. Where are those guys and the doctor? There! There? I'm bringing the doctor! What happened? Nanda? Can you hear me? I can hear you. Stop weeping and answer me. Everything is screwed, brother. Did you see? Doctor! They killed our Shiva! Did you see them killing Shiva? I saw it, brother. He's gone, brother! They killed Praba too! I will be there by tomorrow. Take care of our brother. Understood? Praba is also gone, brother! Hey! Listen! Rukku, there's no problem. I'm going there tomorrow I had warned him, not to go. I tried telling him several times. He didn't listen to me. Sathi, - Come! Come fast! Hey! Listen! There's no problem there, rig ht? From the police? Ya. We are going there now. Okay. We are leaving in 2 minutes from here. - Come! - Ya. We'll reach soon. Come fast, Bhai. Com e. We're getting late. Come on. It has been 13 years since I slept in peace. I always hear her crying on the other side of the bed. All that was for a word she gave. Do you know what that is? That she would never go searching for you or your kids. She kept her word. But until this day, I am being punished for that. I had decided long back; That if ever I was to come face to face with you someday or the other, I'll settle scores for everything that you've done. Mom? Mom? Vishnu! Vishnu! Siddhu, Siddhu, go away from here. Siddhu, go! Leave, I say! To the incessant rains, and the scorching sun; And to all the flora and fauna; The mother who embraces all of them, the Mother Earth! Life originates here, and one day, falls back here and disappears. Mother Earth. Mother Earth. Mother Earth. Rudra! Rudra! Report to the Commandant now! Come on, cadets! Sir! Brigadier Ramachandran has summoned you. Report back home. Sir, is it official or personal? I didn't check that. Next time please check, sir. I don't want my training to get interrupted. Hey! Your dad is calling you! Go! Thank you. Okay sir. I'll take a leave then. Have a good day, young man! I know very well why you came here, Sir. If you ever try to put me in trouble" Colonel knows me very well, right? Get going! Who is in the hospital? Doesn't look like you both have any problem. Then why did you commission me from my training? I almost broke your record today, sir. Don't you know why that Colonel came here? Did you threaten Akshara's father yesterday? Would you stop any prospective groom who comes to see her? Would you break that guy's face? Who do you think you are? Aren't you ashamed to behave like street thugs? You are a Brigadier's son. Did you forget that? Without any discipline, how are you going to become an officer? What? Don't you have anything to say? Shall I say something urgently? What? Get the lunch ready. I'm starving! I'll slap you! Donkey! Everyone is asking me, whether my son is crazy. It's becausel didn't raise you well, it seems. Do I deserve to hear all this? I can't make him understand anymore. Dad & son, can do whatever you want! If even one person comes here to complain against you, You'll see my true colours! Got it? Don't sit there. You're all dirty. I just cleaned it. Mom's share is done. Now you can start. Hey! What your mom said is right. There's no point in you playing the fool in front of her. What do you want me to do? Be practical. None of this is good for you. That Brigadier Sunder Rajan. If he puts a charge on you, your whole future becomes a question mark. I tried. I imagined how my life would be, without her. Not possible! What would you do if you were in my position? If you were madly in love with a girl, what would you do? I am not a fool like you. I won't be doing such things. Whatever I do, I would keep my parents' concern in my mind. Mom has left. Rudra, I have always been like a friend to you. But I must assume the role of your father, in this matter. We don't need these unnecessary problems. Just get rid of it! Okay. I'll get rid of it. Usually, it is said that 6 & 10 don't match. But looking at both their horoscopes, it's a perfect match. So it would be great if you could fix their wedding in April itself. In that case, we needn't delay it anymore. If you don't have any objection, we can fix an auspicious date. Like I said earlier, you have my full consent, uncle. If we could know Akshara's wish as well.. Akshara. Akshara! Akshara! Sreesanth, Isn't that your name? - Sreekanth. I think you're amazing! Uncle, one minute! So, Sreesanth! Sreekanth! - Doesn't matter! Our horoscopes are a perfect match! I will be a best life partner for you. Your family, They're so lovely. I will be one among you. And then kids! I'm sure they'll be lovely. I mean, just look at us! Actually, just look at me. But. But. There's a small problem. What problem? Here comes the problem! One second! Why are you late? You're always late. WW Fm Catch! Academy Cadet Adjutant Rudra Ramachandran. Also, Akshara's boyfriend. Groom! Get up! - Excuse me? She is mine! Do you want to marry her? Then come and knock me out. Didn't understand? That's why I asked you to get up! Rudra! Let him go! Why are you getting tensed, sir? Didn't I tell you that whichever groom comes to see her, I'll come here. It's actually beneficial for you too. Don't you want to know if your daughter's groom is brave enough? If Akshara faces a problem in the future, how do we know whether he won't leave her and go? Hey! I can take care of myself! I know that. You'll take care of him. But the groom? What's your name? Sreesanth. I mean, Sreekanth. Shouldn't we know whether Sreekanth can take good care of you? What is this, sir? You're calling us home & insulting us? How can you humiliate us like this? I didn't expect this from you. Rudra! Sheesh! This is not Sreekanth. This is Sree-Wimp! Groom is knocked out in 5 seconds, sir. Next time, we'll find a great guy. Like me. Akshara! Here I am! Don't worry aunty! I'll drop her back by 8 o'clock! 8 o'clock morning! Throw him out of the Academy first. I want him on charge sheet. Things have gone out of control. With the ruckus he created at home, I can't even show my face to people. He will learn only if he is sent to jail. Excuse me. Me and my wife tried our best to advise him. We also made him understand that all this would affect his records. To use force against him and make him understand, he's not a little child. And we all know, Rudra is a meritorious cadet. But in this topic, if you still think expulsion is all that is left, you can go ahead. He's not a school kid! He's a bloody animal! He'll learn only if he is tied up & beaten up. Can you please stop? Why is one everyone targeting my son? If something has happened, not just him; Your daughter is also responsible for that. They cannot control their daughter. For that, how is it fair to put my son on charge sheet? Don't talk to me about being fair. Don't you know that threatening a decorated officer & family is a punishable of fence? Your son is a repeat offender. If you cannot control your son, tell me. I'll take care of it. Would you take good care of me, sir? Then adopt me! This bloody tongue of yours! Vidya, enough. Rudra, go outside. What did I do? Where are you going? Sit down! See what I'm dealing with. I want him expelled. Pefiod. Let's not make it official. I'll give him a warning. Verbal warnings are pointless. I'm planning to send my daughter to Australia. I want their word. That he won't create a problem there as well. I think it's better that I become a civilian. Civilian? Why? Your dad doesn't like me because I'm going to be an army officer, right? My dad doesn't like YOU! In any case, I'm not going to marry a civilian. So if I was a doctor or a clerk, a salesman at a textile store? Won't you love me? What doctor-engineer? If you were an auto driver, lorry driver, bar owner, or even a laundry guy, my Rudra Deva, I'll still love you! Yesterday your dad said you were going abroad? Holiday? Akshara'? I got through Deakin University. Deakin? Australia? And you're going? Rudra, I really didn't think I would get through. But after getting the admission, dad says that I must go. What do you think? I'm thinking, it's a good idea too. Listen, it's better that we stay apart for some time. I'll finish my course. You finish your training. Then we'll do what we have to do. These days long distance relationships are not a matter at all! You know, these days with Face Time, Skype and all, it will be like we're just right next to each other. I want this Face Time! If you go to Australia, and what if some foreigner woos you? I won't even hesitate to kill! The ioreKQner'? You! Who can resist me, who's so hot and cute? I can't blame them! Didn't I tell you that day? You are mine! Just mine! I'm also saying the same thing. I belong to you! Just you! Trust me! I belong to you! Just you! Trust me! I'm yours'.! Yours alone! Trust me! Those were her last words to me. After that, I have never heard about her. You didn't hear from her? What do you mean? I tried contacting her several times. But she didn't agree. She left to Australia the very next week. I couldn't bear it after a point. I arranged some money, took an FL and went to Australia, to see her. You went to Australia to meet her? - And did you see her? Did you meet her or not? I saw her. But you know what she did then? She went inside her house and shut the door. I waited outside her house for that whole night. She didn't open the door. And didn't even speak a word to me. That girl seems to have a heart of stone. The Akshara I know wouldn't have done that. She has changed a lot! For the past 4 years, I've been fooling myself saying that. That she is no one to me. Until this letter came to me yesterday. Her irritating cousin sent it to me. He did it on purpose. To irritate me. She's getting married? She's marrying a police man? What nonsense is this, dude? More than her marriage, the fact that she's marrying a police officer made me angry. Why? Sir? Why is she marrying a police officer? I don't know, sir. Why did she leave without telling anything to you? I don't know. Don't you want to find out? No. I got over her long back. I convinced myself that I would never get an answer to why she did that. And that's when I get this letter! Some day, when I'm not next to you, if my memories or thoughts - nothing is left with you, will you still love me? Wake up! Wake up! Let's go! Where, sir? If we leave, in 4 to 5 hours, we'll be there. We'll be there by lunchtime. Where are we going? You might not want to know it. But we need an answer. Lieutenant! In my unit, officers don't accept defeat. Now let's go get some answers. Come only after getting an answer. Good luck! Hi. Hi. Can you guys excuse us for a few minutes? Should we leave? Ya. 2 minutes. I need to talk to you. I didn't come to trouble you. 2 minutes. You look really beautiful. I've never seen you looking more beautiful than this. Rudra, go away from here. Did you agree to this marriage? Please go. I'll go. But answer me first. Akshara! Coming! Got to go. Will you still love me? You're going to be someone else's wife tomorrow Even then? Will you still love me? Get up! She's mine! Mine alone! Rudra! If you want to marry her tomorrow, you have to knock me out now. Rudra, please don't create a scene. Are you deaf or what? Get up, I say! Are police officers scared of soldiers? Come alone if you dare! Let's fight it out! Rudra, stop it! Get out! - Alok.. - It's okay. I'll take care of this. Come on! Hit him, Rudra! KC, leave him alone. But sir, how can we.. Shut up! Come on, Rudra! Hit him, Rudra! Police Academy gold medallist. National level boxing champion. Well done, Alok. That's my boy. Well done! We didn't come here to carry you away from here. I've seen you fig ht before. You are better than this. Come on! Take your trash, and leave! That's our boy! Come on, Rudra. Hit him back! Come on! Let the beats begin! Enough! Why are you doing this? That's what I'm also asking you! How did I become a nobody to you one fine morning? Only I know how much I've suffered without an answer for that. You can marry whoever you want! I care a damn! But why did you do this to me? I need to know that! Tell me! You need an answer, rig ht? Go ask your dad! We are not together today because of your father! What did you just say? What did you just say? Go ask him! He begged me to stay away from you! You would have been dismissed from the Academy. Do you know that? My dad had done all the arrangements for that. If you didn't become an army officer, he would have been devastated. That's why he came to me and pleaded. Dad wouldn't do that. He's my best friend. Even when you came to Australia, he called me. He was the one who told me not to meet you. Even if he said so, would you do it? You think it's been easy for me? Really? It's taken me so long to get over you. And now finally, when I've moved on; You come here, on my wedding day; And ruin everything for me! You've ruined everything for me! Just leave! Leave! Get in. Come in. Hi ma'am. - Welcome. Hi? gum You can have one more. - Can you pass this please? For you? Chicken for you. Do you want Roti? Rudra, pass that. Rudra, I was asking you. Why did dad do this to me? You could have done it. But I didn't expect it from dad. He's my best friend. How could he even think of doing it? There's something that we haven't told anyone. You were around 2 years old then. Your dad and I had decided to separate. If we lived together even after that, it is because of you. Just you. It's something that we didn't want you to know, all these years; I have to tell that to you now. Back then, the reason for the problem between us; Was because your dad had an affair with another woman. Dad? How is that related to this? It is related. That woman, is Akshara's mother. But that affair came to an end soon enough. A few days after that, we heard that she was pregnant. So Akshara'? I don't know. We never tried to find out. Initially we thought, what you had with Akshara was, a teenage infatuation, and that it would be gone soon enough. But as you both grew closer, our fear also grew stronger. As much as we tried to separate you, you both grew even closer. When we realized things are going out of control; And we had to do something somehow, your dad decided to meet Akshara. Ms'? E He didn't tell her anything. Does Akshara know about this? - I hope not. We know; Her mom should be knowing; Her dad? Rudra, Rudra! We should have told this to you first. We're really sorry. There's.. There's no fault of yours in this. You didn't do anything wrong. It's all our fault. Please Rudra. We're really sorry! Not your fault. You didn't do anything wrong. Sorry! Why, dad? It happens. Didn't you get anyone else? What if I ask the same thing to you?
