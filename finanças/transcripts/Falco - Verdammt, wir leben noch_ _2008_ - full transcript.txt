MR Falco - dammit we?re still alive Incredible how well Hansi plays. I?d rather he became a doctor. That?s a serious profession. The auditorium was full of people. See how practicing pays off? Nothing leads to nothing. Remember, Hans. To be able to look in the mirror and to have people who love you ... that?s important in life. Sleep well, Hans. Why didn?t dad come? He couldn?t leave work. He was really sorry. Goodnight, Hans. Hello, there! How long is it on with that slut? What? Don?t act stupid! A customer of mine saw you ... ... With your boss?s secretary! You went to a hotel! Are you crazy? The whole street?s talking, you son of a bitch! Calm down, Hans could hear us! Why should I calm down, you pig! Hans will find out anyway! I can explain. There?s nothing to explain. You told me you worked after hours ... What are you doing with your bag? That?s none of your business. You?re skipping school? And you? No, I?m on the way to school. I just made a delivery. For my father. Who are you anyway? I?m Billy. So, what do you want? I want to know what you?re up to. What?s that boys? No school? We just took a look ... You?re too young to take a look. Sorry. When you grow up, you can also touch. Touch? You can buy love here. That?s how it works. And now go! Go to school and learn! So you?ll achieve something. It?s about a commission? Yes. I?m at your service. Wedding marches, banquet tunes, what do you require? A requiem. A requiem mass? Yes. If you accept. For whom? The name is of no importance. It?s for a soul. That?s no ordinary commission. I?m so hungry. Food at school was terrible. What was it? Something ... weird ... with meat ... According to this you?ve been skipping school ... for three weeks ... Where did you go? I want to know where you?ve been strolling around! I don?t like school, mum. There?s a lot of things i don?t like. Still I do them. That?s what adults do. I want to grow up fast to do exciting stuff. Pardon? Look, I want to be a pop star. No need for school then. Pop star? When you?ve finished school, be what you want. Until then you?ll go to school. Understood? Yes. If I didn?t have you ... My god. - My boy. - Mum. My parents told me not to meet with you again. They?ll calm down. You always go too far, Hans. A few days in school and nothing would have happened. But we didn?t go. My father will not allow me to play the piano. He sends me to a sports group. What?s that for? Sports. Soccer and stuff. Tennis. We won?t have a band then? Don?t think so. Why don?t I have siblings? You had two. They were in me with you. They died before birth. Died? You were triplets. Only you were born. The doctors couldn?t believe such a miracle. Did you bury them? No, they were too little. Four months. Not really human yet. I was so happy when you were born. Very happy. May I listen to the radio? Well, I forbid ... Two songs. Thanks, mum. That?s it for today. 12 o?clock tomorrow. Vickerl, I want to evolve... that?s why I also play with Weber?s group ... with "Drahdiwaberl". Hansi Lang, too. Well, I can tell you ... there?s no money in that. But Weber lets me sing if he likes the song. Solo. My own song. I see, a very own H?lzel song. Didn?t know such a thing existed. I don?t want to be second row forever. See you tomorrow at 12. Bye ... H?lzel. Do you really have your own songs? I wrote lyrics ... I mean ... treatments ... and bass lines ... C?mon, let me hear them. Maybe I can contribute. Strange. We?re rehearsing in this stadium where all the big gigs take place ... we should be playing here ... 50.000 people screaming your name ... Hansi! H?lzel! Very funny. You can change a name. But you should be unique. That?s what people pay for. That?s what they pay for? I thought they came for the music? David Bowie ... I like his thing. He took his name from a hunting knife. His styling is from another planet, the music is a smash! If you come up with such a thing, you?ve made it. That works in America, they?ll declare you insane here. Most people do anyway. Americans have no culture. We Europeans have a rich background. Americans dig that. It?s really the English who set musical trends. The Americans understand their language and copy them. Would you like to live in America? - In L.A., on the beach ... - I don?t know how they tick over there. Why America? Let?s move to the countryside and open a commune on a farm! Oh no. Boring. Everybody fucks everybody and raises sheep. Nothing for me. What would you do if the "Company" had a hit? Just the same - sex, drugs and rock?n?roll. You?ll have to work harder. Pot and beer won?t make you famous. Look Billy. An entrepreneur?s son like you doesn?t need that ... Money?s no problem for Mr. Filanowski ... My parents want me in the office three days a week. Oh god, Billy! Really? Three days? Anybody got pot? [voice of actor Oskar Werner] His heart is racing, he takes her as his wife. Don?t flee love, my friends. Nobody flees her realm. If Amor catches you, you?re done with. Look - artists and newspapers, that?s a natural conflict. We have to keep secrets, papers have to unveil secrets. We have to keep secrets, papers have to unveil secrets. As your mother I?d like to know if your music pays your life? Sure, mum. Each weekend I play dance music in discos. That pays the bills. I also play with the "Hallucination Company" and with "Drahdiwaberl". And I have my own songs. What?s that band?s name? "Drahdiwaberl" - "Spin, woman". Wonderful. Thank you, mother. Doesn?t your girlfriend cook for you? Young women today are different. They don?t want to stay at home and cook. I went to work, too - still I always cared for you. You?re unique, mum. What can you do? Joker. Really. Progress is a sign of our time. Progress means change. Where did you hear that? From politics, from Bruno. [Bruno Kreisky, Austrian chancellor] Since when do you care for politics? - My girlfriend Chouchou does. - I see. She says, in the end all politicians will run away with the money. Does she? How progressive. What are your models in music? I like the Beatles, but we want to do something of our own. Something new. Since when is he on heroin? Some time. It?s supposedly intense. It?s hard to stop though. Did you try? No, but I took LSD. Crazy stuff. We always had someone with us who took nothing. For safety reasons. It can turn out bad. If you can?t handle it, leave it. It?s not about handling. They got the best birds in Vienna. They don?t fuss around. - You?ve been here before? - Two times. - Expensive? - Depends on your desires. I always want everything. Always everything. You know what?s funny? What? All day we?re talking in German, and here we?re copying English pop culture. That?s crap. I think so. Why don?t we write German lyrics? You got one? Rehearsal?s over, gentlemen and choir boys! Gig?s on saturday, Soundchek is at 5 p.m., be on time! I don?t want "Drahdiwaberl" to show bad behaviour. You said, I could sing, if you like the song. You got one? First they were laughing, but they turned quiet when I sang. Rabitsch even played along. Great. Congrats. What do you think? Too many gangster movies? Why? Imagine a white suit, a silk scarf and white shoes. Maybe shorter hair. And this hat? Exactly. Yeah, funny. Funny? I?ll show you funny. You give up? Many people succed without talent. They exploit other people?s talent. I can make it on my own. You talk like a politician. You want to open new perspectives for our youth? I don?t believe in politics. You pay taxes for nothing in return. Oopsie. You don?t know anything. I know different things. Stop! It?s always the same. Music and fucking, that?s all you know. That?s not true. What about pollution? That?s an important subject. You don?t care at all. Male dominance of our society? You don?t care. Now you bring that up again. You can?t make normal conversation, not for 5 minutes. Talk about emancipation to your friends, but spare me, okay? - Is it that bad ... ? - You?re a reactionary! In front of your friends you play the artist, drinking and smoking pot. But you know what? You?re a typical bourgeois! A bourgeois? I want to be with a woman who doesn?t think like a man. You?re so primitive. Please stay! I?m sorry. You?re right, I don?t understand. That?s typical. A midget christmas tree, but the biggest TV set. I had to spend a few fees. But there?s enough left for a son to take his mother to a Christmas dinner. No girlfriend at the moment? No, girlfriends are sold out. Temporarily. Take your time. Most young women are sluts anyway. Mother, let?s not spoil Christmas Eve with pointless discussions. Imagine you?re famous and everybody recognizes you ... in the pub, at the baker?s, the cinema ... I?d like it. If you?re successful, everybody waits for your fall. In Vienna you have to die to be praised ... but after that you?ll live long. Glory has it?s dark sides. My mother could?ve said that. How long will it take till Munich anyway? Now this season?s super flyer, Falko Wei?pflog. Will he compete for today?s victory? No, that will not be enough. Superflyer Falko Wei?pflog has been beaten. Falco ... Superflyer Falco ... What?s happened to you? Carnival?s not begun yet. Hans, get changed, we?re almost on. Handsome. Where?d you get that suit? Vickerl, don?t say, "On bass, Hans H?lzel", but ... ... on bass, Falco! Be so kind. Will you wear that with "Drahdiwaberl", too? All of Vienna is on heroin today. All of Vienna ... dreams on Mozambine. All of Vienna ... also takes cocaine. In ball season anyway. You see, all of Vienna ... is wonderfully wasted. Cocaine, codeine, heroin and mozambine ... destroy us, 1 - 2 -3. Cocaine, codeine, heroin and mozambine destroy us. The day will come, the river Danube will go wild, in the U4 the gold fish will party, [U4: legendary new wave club] Bruno?s safe on the shore, and Hannes, too. [politicians] We?ll learn how to swim, we?re floating anyway. My band mates won?t believe that Falco?s got a record deal. You?ll have to get used to two things in this business: envy and mischief. I won?t be stopped by that. If someone gets in my way, I light a cigarette and blow him away. No, I?m sorry, Mr. Spiegel. I don?t understand what ... what?s his name? ... what he?s singing about. First you have a song about Vienna on heroin, which we cannot play, of course. And now that nursery rhyme ... I?m sorry, Mr. Spiegel. Such an asshole! Just blow him away, huh? He knows nothing. You?re a newbie. You know zip about media and journalists. Is it like the Circus Maximus? One thumb down and you?re done? That?s business, you have to run along. Without these people nothing goes. Another thing: Never take on a journalist. Rather take on the president. He may pardon you. What can we do now? Bork speaking. This is Hans H?lzel. Falco from Vienna. Markus Spiegel talked to you? Markus told me that you have a potential hit there? There?s a few songs. We?re working on an album ... with my producer, Robert Ponger. Yeah, I?m here. Fine. Come to Hamburg, I?ll listen to it. The case is clear, Herr Kommissar, even if you think otherwise, All the children know the snow we?re gliding downhill on. And now the nursery rhyme: Don?t turn around, the Kommissar?s around. He?s got the power, we?re all small and dumb, and ... What do you want from a manager? We want a release in Germany, Mr. Bork. Austrian radio won?t play us ... Mr. Spiegel thought, radio stations here might be more open. To this new, rough and cool wave. Artist, producer, record company, manager ... four fit in a taxi. Traditional mangers? saying. All?s clear, Herr Kommissar? We meet, Jil and Joe, his brother Hip and the rest of that cool gang, they?re rapping here and there, while they?re scratching at the walls, The case is clear, Herr Kommissar, even if you think otherwise, All the children know the snow we?re gliding downhill on. And now the nursery rhyme: Don?t turn around, the Kommissar?s around. He?s got the power, we?re small and stupid, and the frustration turns us mute. You?re number one in Germany, what?s your statement? My statement? It shows the Krauts have taste. What an arrogant prick. Nice to see a human being. We?re number one in Austria. We?ll have to finish the album fast. No problem on my part. Only If I refuse to take off my shoes again ... Which I intend to do. Whoever smells the maze first, gets his trial first. Berlin?s a cloud, we?re on the run again. The album?s a smash! I told you, it will get a lot of air play. The "Kommissar" did enter the UK charts? At number ... 5, I think. I really liked the song ... at second or third try. - But this is ... - A smash! Fifty percent for the producer? That?s in the contract. I agreed on that, that?s a common deal. It has to be a million by now. About that, yes. - Can?t we do anything? - No. Have him record a playback tape. You have to do PR in Germany. In all of Europe. Record stores, radio shows, local papers ... the hard way. February 19th is my birthday. My 41st. I?d like you to be here, Billy. You?re flying Lauda Air on the 18th, I booked the return flight for March 4th. Call me back. - Don?t you recognize me? - Of course, Hansi. Hi. It?s been an eternity. How are you? Super. I often hear you on the radio. I saw you on TV. Screw it. Why are you here? I have a customer to meet here. You know what, Billy? I haven?t seen Hans for a year. Not even a phone call. For more than one year. He?s on promotion tour all over the world. - I see him regularly. I can ... - We miss him. Everybody. We all miss Hans. He?ll call, I?m sure. We don?t want anything from him. Like money or stuff. - We don?t need that, look. - Sure, Hansi. I know. - Will you tell him that? - I will. Why not? If I walk into a shop to photograph a jacket and shirts they?ll ask why. Then you?ll them them that a customer who can?t come himself is interested. Hi Billy, old pervert. Connie - Billy, Billy - Connie. Hi. Choose something nice for me and call me before you come. Come in. I think I described all of my life in my first album. Emotions, experiences, fears ... Yes - fears! I?m empty now. No words emerge from my head. I turn it left, right, shake it - nothing. Silence. Just the phone ringing. The company wants the album, Spiegel says waiting costs him a million ... The press want stories, my mother worries. Even Bork is nervous. There are more important things. The whole world waits for the end ... Every moment the sky could darken and the world will be swallowed. As a friend I gotta tell you ... ever since you came back from your tour I don?t recognize you. What?s happened? Nothing. I sold 6 million copies, I?m a dollar millionaire, nothing new. That was much in a short time. I think you drink too much, Hans. You do too much coke, you?re withdrawing from the world. You sit here all day watching videos. This one?s great. They saw off someone?s ... You have the booze brought to you from the cafe downstairs ... You feed on pizza deliveries, there?s one girl after the other. Everything I release will compared to the "Kommissar?s" sucess. Can you imagine that? Just blank paper to write a world wide hit? I see you?re under pressure. Still ... Everybody wonders why you avoid contact. Why? I can?t trust anybody. - Nonsense. - Support here, money there - I can?t! Don?t play the whining jerk! How long will you imprison yourself? Pull yourself together! I make it as hard as possible for me, believe me. I do. Get back on your feet, Hans! Go on holiday! Go to Italy and enjoy yourself! You?ll be Hans H?lzel again. What you don?t want me to do to you, I trust someone else to do. What about that? I don?t know. I can?t judge. You can?t judge, but I can. I?ll only record it what I like. Which one of you three really digs me? One of you has to love me, no? Shit. Don?t ask for old new values, see white light, see just emotions, the night is ours until sunrise, we?re into all games. Don?t let this journey ever end, doing comes from being, alone from the dimensions, the illusions and sensations pay off ... Young Romans, dance differently from everybody else, they love their sisters more than everybody else. Ask the young Romans: Do you still know the sun? - It knows the sorrows. Young Romans, the night is young like you, forget about tomorrow. [Italian lyrics] From the album "Young Romans" which fell behind sales expectations. It was number one in Austria but doesn?t go well abroad. Why? - Not only Falco is asking that. Maybe the new single will work. No, it doesn?t. Maybe the album?s ahead of it?s time ... but the fans expected something else. The first white rapper. - Too much art, too little commerce. - Maybe. Maybe this was a necessary step in his evolution. The Americans have lost interest. What to do? A new album - as long as he?s hot. Or just a single. It won?t be easy ... ... to ask that of him. Young Romans bombed. - Let?s be honest. - You know Hans. He?s down right now. It will turn to depression, he?ll be gone the next months. Let him get some rest. While he?s at that, others can start to write songs. He won?t work with Ponger. They?re too different. They hate each other. He needs a new sound. I know who can deliver. So who? The Bolland brothers. Rob and Ferdy Bolland in Amsterdam. What?s up with those two cheese wranglers? Listen to it, dammit! It?s a great single, after that you?ll work on the album. I?m watching a great movie, my dear. You?ve seen it a 100 times. I demand you to listen! How can two run down child stars who maybe can sing in a choir ... understand Falco?s world view and write about it? It?s more likely than you writing 15 great songs. Now fucking listen! I got one more chance ... either the new single takes off or I?ll stay a one hit wonder. Understand my reservations. I?ll get a big advance payment if we work with the Bollands, I promise. What?s the title? He was a punker in the big city, In Vienna he did all his things. He was broke, because he drank, but all the women loved him... calling out: "Rock me, Amadeus!" He was a superstar, popular, he was eccentric, cause he had style, he was a master, a rock idol, everybody called out: "Rock me, Amadeus!" It was around 1780 in Vienna, no plastic money anymore, the banks against him, Everybody knew where the debts came from - he loved women, they loved his punk. He was a superstar, popular, he was eccentric, that was his style. He was a master, a rock idol, everybody still calls out: "Rock me, Amadeus!" We?ll be number one in Germany soon. The record deal ends soon, such a hit makes negotiating easier. What?s up, Hans? I see. The blonde, huh? She?s my type. Blonde, tall, tuberculose. Go and tell them to come here. You gotta be in Holland tomorrow, they?ll cancel if you miss the flight gain. I won?t miss it. Please get the blonde. May I introduce, this is Miss Jacqueline. - That?s her friend ... - Susanne ... Susi. Let?s sit down. She wanted to get to know you ... ... ever since she saw you on TV. Stop it. Pity it took that long. Did you see the gig? - No. - We changed our mind. How was it? Call me Hans, okay? What shall we drink? The same? Sure. Horst, check it! Jacqueline is a big fan. I just turned a fan of hers. Horst, she?s incredibly hot. Miss Styria 1981, did you know? No, but we have to leave, Hans. Meet her again, when you?re sober. I can?t let her go home. You?ll have to, she said she was married. Screw it. - Hans, you can?t ... - I don?t need a nanny! Stop it! I told you I?m a rock star and I don?t want her to go. Yeah, sure. Everything?s fine, Hans. Zip up your trousers. Fucking trousers. What?s my room number? What? Horst ... my room number ... Please. Horst, master of the strings. Let me hug you. How are things in beautiful Hilversum? Rob said you drank too much. They had to stop recordings. Is that true? Again: I don?t need nannies. I need tough producers. I?m the director. It should say on the cover: Directed by Falco. I never saw that before. Which makes it good. Tell it to the flatlanders. Hans, I don?t want you to block yourself. I have visions. I?m afraid that those two Edamers will turn it into ordinary. You know this won?t happen, Hans. Just concentrate on the recordings. - Uhm, that girl song ... - Jeannie. - Yes, Jeannie. It?s madness. It will create a big uproar when released. Yesterday they showed me lyrics for a song called "Vidiot". About a guy who spends his days watching videos. Guess who they meant? Funny, no? Don?t blow it up, that?s a joke. A Joke, fine. But I won?t get mocked ... by two woodclogs with a fucking studio at world?s ass. I wrote new lyrics in one hour. About America and Rock?n?Roll. Because ... ... that?s what those cheese eaters dig. The story?s this, cause everybody knows, it wasn?t always easy with Dig?n?Roll music in this country. In me everything?s white spritzer though I?m drinking whisky since I went to USA. They say, "Falco you are wonderful" - hey, give yourself a break, if you still buy my records, that?s okay with me. The typical thing about me is that I?m entirely untypical, Sometimes up, sometimes down, sometimes drunk, sometimes sober. You?ll have to take me as I am, I?m telling you. Show me a slender leg, then I?ll be there for you. America - believe how much you can be missed. America - believe how much you can be missed. It?s me, Hans. I want to see you. What? Take a plane as soon as possible. Why should I? - First I don?t hear from you ... - I?ll die without you. I have to feel your skin, smell your hair. Come. Jacqueline, hello? Where are you? A hotel in Munich. I got a gig tomorrow. What are you doing exactly? Did you know Elvis? twin brother died at birth? No. I had two siblings which my mother lost. I?d have been one of triplets. Really? Maybe that?s why you have so many faces. Do I? Dunno. I think. Strange that I was to survive. I think it makes me strong. The knowledge of having escaped death once. Hans, I gotta tell you ... It gives energy and courage. Maybe too much. I?m pregnant. Pregnant? Yes, it took me by surprise. Yeah ... how ... ? Our first night in Graz. By me? I never expected it. Like a miracle, huh? In Graz? Yes. I don?t even remember. You don?t want it? Are you crazy? Of course I want it. I?m happy. Falco will be a dad. You?re sweet when you?re happy. I can?t believe we?ll have a child. Nice. Great. And big enough for a start. Guess so. Let?s see what Hans thinks once the child is here. It?s some time. You met in Graz? In Graz, yes. I?m from Graz. When was that? Not long ago ... June. In June ... Well, he fell in love head over heels again. I guess. I?m having a divorce ... didn?t work out ... The keys. I let in some air. You?ll adapt quickly. Thank you. Stella sits in Rio, Stella lies in Tokyo. Men ask her for fire and the other thing. Sugar Chris misses you a lot, your leg and your face. You can do without me but not without luxury. What do little girls play with, be it Tucson, Arizona or Toronto, Canada? Vienna, Vienna, you know me up and down, Only you, Vienna, where have your women gone? Two, one, zero, red alert - Vienna in danger! - I?ll get a drink, you too? - No thanks. What?s that? It?s for sleeping. I?m going to Germany tomorrow morning. When will you be back? The day after tomorrow, baby. Sometimes I have to sell my skin. What are those tubes and needles in your dressing room? How do you know? Just saw them. Do you spy on me? So soon? Definitely not. Do I have a reason? It?s a kind of ... doping. A cleansing of blood. They take it, add oxygene, and put it back. Then my body?s 15 years younger. And healthier. Really? Money can buy anything. I couldn?t last a tour otherwise. Crazy, what you do to your body. Don?t start like that. I don?t take that well. And that from somebody who smokes and drinks during pregnancy. Finally honest words. A macho like you can?t be tolerated soberly. You?re so pathetic. You don?t even know what a macho is. Go to your mother and cry there. Not necessary. My mother thinks all my girls are sluts. Pardon? Forget it. Stupid asshole! I want an apology! Sorry, I didn?t mean it. I don?t believe you. I wanted to hurt you. That was stupid. Sorry. Never say that again. Or I?m gone. I promise. Everything will be different with the child. I?ll stop drinking ... also the other stuff ... It?s cold Let?s get out of here. Your lipstick is smeared. You bought it. And I watched. Too much red on your lips. You said: "Don?t pick me up!" But I saw the truth. Eyes tell more than words. You need me, huh? Everybody knows we?re together. I hear them. They?re coming to get you. They won?t find you. You?re here with me. After five years abroad and with no knowledge of German pop ... I heard Falco?s "Jeannie" on the radio ... and got appropriately enraged. That could have been it. Then I heard it was number one everywhere ... I heard it sold 20.000 copies just yesterday. Facts and numbers make "Jeannie" a news issue. In the last months the number of missing persons rose dramatically. Local police report another tragic case. It?s about a 19 year old girl, last seen two weeks ago. Police can?t exclude the possibility of a crime. Three Austrain Catholic organizations talk about an irresponsible game with crime and violence. They?d like Austrian radio to follow the German broadcast ban. I knew the candle eaters would react like that. Incredible how easy to manipulate the media. You?re right. Eight German women?s associations protested against the song. They say it?s a war song playing down violence against women. They complain that the song ... endorses sexual assault and murder. Worst thing is we?re still number one in Germany. Right. In a few weeks we?ll announce ... there will be a sequel to "Jeannie" on the next album. It?s agreed upon with the Bollands. Next we?ll put "Amadeus" on the US market, then it?ll be Christmas ... Hans will go on holiday ... in January everybody will have calmed down. Yes ... unfortunately. That?s business. Hans, the Carribean?s a dream ... the islands and stuff. Look ... MTV America, baby. Who?s on the air? Your man. What do you prefer to watch? This? Or this? Inhale. Deeply. My daughter. Carolina Tanja. Your dad loves you. I?ll always look after you. I love you, sweet little flea. Today she?s one week old. Are they at home? I?ll fetch them tomorrow. Were you present at birth? Sure. It was hard. But when I think how cute Carolina is... how she looked at her dad, the sweet girl. Let?s drink to that. To Carolina. You?re number one, Hans. Number one in the US charts. The first German language number one in US rock history! Champaign! We only have sparkling wine. Three bottles! Incredible! Elton John?s "Nikita" is on 9. Prince?s "Kiss" at 5. John Mellencamp?s "Heart" is on 2. And number one is "Rock Me Amadeus" by Falco. Dude, you made it. - I always believed in you. - Thank you. You were number one in England and the US. Aren?t you happy? That?s the biggest thing to achive as a rock musician. They?ll judge me on that basis forever. Maybe I cannot repeat that. Stop that. Be happy and celebrate. One thing I know. They will only love me again when I?m dead. Excuse me. Hans! A toast! I?ll be back. The world revolves around me. I?m an egoiste, the guy closest to me is myself. Tell me - are you really that stupid? Watch your mouth! It freaks me out when my girl doesn?t know David Bowie and thinks "Solid Gold" is a jewellery store. That?s not important. Everybody is asking, where I got such a birdbrain. - I just asked a question. - Hit me again and I?ll hit back. You can?t tell me anything, I decide how to live my life. If you live with me, you have to live accordingly. Stop shouting, you?ll wake the girl. Then I?ll put her to sleep again. Just shut up. Crazy asshole! I?m not done yet. Coward! Hit a woman? You?re a white trash pig! Let?s see what your mother has to say about that. Drinking damaged your brain. The coke, too. Don?t you hear our daughter crying? My dear, your mother?s shouting, but daddy will take care of you. I?m here. I love you. - What are you up to? - Give me the child! Give me the child. Our lawyers will sort out the rest. You make a fool of yourself. You?re crazy. Kiss my ass! Get lost! Never come back! Never! Don?t think you will ever enter here again! That?s that. What if I hadn?t been at the train station? Where would you go with her? To your parents in Graz, of course. Not that hard to guess. I would have gone. 10 minutes later I?d been gone. I would have banged at the door in Graz. You?re a crazy guy. It?s 7 p.m local time, West Village, business as usual. The city?s noisy, the air is bad. The music?s black. What do you say? Great house, huh? Maybe this is a mistake ... but the best things about the American flag are those red and white stripes. I don?t want to live here. We don?t have to rush it, but to have success in America, you?ll have to be here. You have to adapt to the culture, meet the right people at parties ... You?ll have to be more reliable. Yes, but if I?m not comfortable here... Am I supposed to raise my daughter in LA? With all that crime, the earthquakes and fires? You?re exaggerating. - Many people with children live here. - No, no, no. I won?t do that to my princess. My family comes first. You know what that means? At the bottom of my heart I swim against the waves. Don?t worry. Let?s have a drink. What is it, Jackie? I?m working. So? It?s 4 a.m. Come to bed. I?m an artist. A blade runner, gambling with life. I don?t work 9 to 5. If you want that, get an office worker. I?ll go to the studio today. The song is dedicated to you. It?s called "Emotional", it?s about ... Come. You?re Falco. You call the shots. Your family needs a father, not a human wreck. Turn off the lights. I won?t be able to sleep, baby. Yes, you will. Sometimes I wish I were normal again. And that writing?s easier again. It will be, Hans. We?re high up, like never before. We?ll play the new album live. With samples and two hot background singers. Let?s talk about it tomorrow. No. Why? We?ll tour Japan and the US, you?re the band leader. Awesome! Japan! You?ll rehearse the songs, I?ll come in at the end. - Okay, Hans. - Great, dude. Don?t you have a video shoot tomorrow? Thank you for calling, guys. On behalf of Hans, too. I?m sorry. You?re welcome, Mrs. H?lzel. He?s okay again. He won?t go home though. He has family trouble. Jacqueline moved out again. My god. Stop it! Get up! We go home. Mum. - Why are you here? - Get up, the cab is waiting! Come on. - Come. - Come on, Hans! I know that the woman who can tolerate me, hasn?t been born yet. But I beg you: Come into the world! You know I got a lion?s heart. I decided to dedicate the album to Carolina. I?ll put it on the cover. I can?t do without you two. The big apartment is so cold and empty. Heard that before. Can?t remember how many times. Jackie, I?m a man of extremes, I know I?m a jerk to many people. I do everything excessively. But we?re family, baby. Over there?s our child. Should she grow up without a father ... in Graz? Even if she?s got a loving father? You weren?t loved enough in your life. You lack something there. You can?t deal with love. When you?re hurt you don?t seek a human embrace, you lock yourself into yourself and heal yourself with booze and drugs. I?ll quit, you?ll see. You?re insecure in every respect, you drink out of fear. You?re afraid of people. Of failure. If someone gives you love, you?ll treat them like a dog. You owe me one more chance. One last cance. You and me against the world. You have judged us, you have judged me. But our time has come, when a dream comes true. They?re crazy about Falco here. In the hotel a hundred cute Japanese girls wait for a photo and a signature. At night they throw their panties at me. Then I?ll come with you next time. Any news at home? Not that much. Papers say you?ll receive the "Golden Bambi" along Paul McCartney. True. The Germans have style. True. Congratulations. - I gotta go, Horst is there. - Okay, take care, bye. - Bye. Horst, my friend. I hope it?s nothing to ruin my mood. I?m afraid it is. American tour is cancelled. Yes. The producer won?t take the risk. - No chart breaker since "Amadeus", no yellow press ... - Well, the pissers will have to do without me then. Up in smoke. Fuck them. What is it? There?s a request from Brigitte Nielsen, Sylvester Stallones ex-girlfriend ... she wants to be a singer ... the management asks you to record a song with her. Are you crazy? I didn?t want to get into the charts, I wanted to get in her panties. 14 days in Saint Tropez paid off. Asshole! The papers write what they want to. It?s a bad record, too. Stupid drunk fuck! You should know it?s nothing but PR. I don?t know myself why I?m in the yellow press. You think I?m stupid? I?m not that stupid. Pull yourself together! Fuck you! You can as well die! I ... didn?t want to. I?m sorry. Shit. Stay. First it was about Carolina. Everybody says she doesn?t look like me. Then that Nielsen story from the papers. Well, that wasn?t too smart. I hit her in the face and she bled. Are you crazy? I?m terribly sorry. Jacqueline is great in bed ... but other wise ... she?s a bit simple. Who am I talking to right now? Falco or Hans? I?d prefer Hans. - Come on ... - He doesn?t have to play the asshole all the time. She keeps on nagging ... I was back from Japan and she started again. She nags about the drugs ... Like you, Billy. You?re like a woman somehow. That?s no joke, Hans. You destroy yourself. Look at you! You?re always drunk ... the glassy gaze. - Come on. - Decide who you want to be! It will pay off to fight to be Hans again. You talk like Jackie again. I?ll be going, Hans. You should, too. Get some sleep, go to Graz tomorrow and persuade her to come back again and again. If you?re sober, call me, we?ll do some workout. Don?t be pissed off. You?re really like a woman ... Billy, wait! You won?t believe me, Jackie ... I have dissapointed you too often... you?re still there even if you?re long gone ... I destroyed myself ... an important part of me has been ripped off ... my pain evokes my real feelings ... I want to show you what you mean to me ... I?m sure now ... that I love you ... ... I want to fight for your love ... and for my beloved daughter Carolina Tanja ... I?m ready to give up everything for you ... I?m nowhere, but I have arrived ... in the centre ... the eye of the storm ... Mother. Your son got married. What is it? No congratulations? Why didn?t you tell anybody? We didn?t want any fuss. It was a quiet ceremony in Vegas. You can imagine that I would have liked to be there? Come on ... It was just minutes ... It was cold. The Americans and their air conditionings ... I?ll play my new song, mother. You?ll like it. You, too, my dear. Falco?s under contract just in Austria? Exactly. Boring. His times are over. Let?s just listen. Let?s see, Mr. Spiegel. I just got the call, I?m sorry. The whole tour has been cancelled due to lack of sales. All the gigs. Germany, Austria, all of them. It?s no use. I know I?m seen as arrogant because I don?t care for the rules. And I?ll fight for that reputation. That?s what you and I live off. That?s not the point. Tha album didn?t fulfill expectations. That?s the point. It?s like "Junge R?mer" after "Einzelhaft". It didn?t sell immediately. Keeping that pattern the next album will be a hit. They mustn?t shit their pants. That?s a weird theory ... I can?t tell them that. You can. You forgot they paid you 40 million for your signature? I think ... we should have stayed with our American label. They built us over there. As soon as they saw me signing somewhere else they dropped me. It?s more complicated. You wanted to switch. It was your idea. You told me we?d get more money. And? What?s your point? Could it be they bribed you to persuade me to sign? How much did you get? Hans, I don?t take that serious ... Why should I do such a thing? I?m your manager? Did you forget? Shit. I don?t care if you like my records. Look at you! No wonder you produce one bomb after the other. You would have ruined the tour with your antics anyway. Shut the fuck up. That?s all you can say. Next thing you drown in self pity and blame it on the bad, bad world. You never understood me. I know. How could you? Your knowledge ends at the door through which I hope you leave now. I will. You must know one thing: I won?t return this time. Never again. We?ll talk about the child in court! Jackie, wait! I want to ask you something. Am I really Carolina?s father? Tell the truth. What do you think of me? A whore that uses a child for a fraud? What will Carolina think if I tell her that? You look fine. Billy went jogging with me, I only drank water in 4 months. That wasn?t bad. Where did you go? No one missed you. Jackie, I told you on the phone, it?s about the divorce. There?s many reasons why we didn?t work out ... I?m sure it was mainly me. However ... Just a moment, Hans ... you sound like a salesman. I?m not sorry. I don?t regret anything. You?re not an easy person ... but I don?t want to miss our times together. Not a second. Me neither. I?ll open an account for Carolina ... I?ll pay you a monthly sum ... I want to give you this, too. What?s that? It?s a marriage contract, my lawyer wants you to sign. What?s written there? What i just said ... plus a statement of confidence. You mustn?t talk about me and our marriage. No interviews, no public statements. Your silence is worth 4 millions to me. You know what? Your lawyer should transfer the money to me. Now take it back to Vienna. I don?t want it like that. Danube Island Festival I left at midnight, he stayed. He was late two hours for sound check. He crawled over the stage, boozed up. He?s seriously drunk. Maybe he took uppers, that and the booze put him out. Can he perform somehow? There?s an audience of 100.000. You?re incredible. It?s raining cats and dogs but you?re still here. Our foot?s on the accelerator, we got fashion covered, We don?t miss a trend, our outfit is up to date. Now whistle! Our sisters bought wild west style costumes yesterday, They say they?re comfy, also they?re beautiful. Sorrows? We don?t have any. What a fashionable world view! What a wonderful life. My life, your life, our life - high life spleen. Say, isn?t it great? So great. I have to know. A big part of my life is just made up. Tell me if this is genuine at least? If this is really Hans H?lzel?s? I don?t know, Hans. It can be either of you. We know she doesn?t look like you. Let?s do a test, I have to know. Is daddy here? Did we wake you? I don?t care. Will you stay? Speaking. I?m not the father. I see. Is this the falcon?s comeback? Behind TMA we find no one less than Falco. He shows a massive sign of life with "Mother, the man with the coke is here". It?s top 10 in Austria, it will chart in Germany in weeks, days, hours, seconds ... This is TMA feat. Falco with "Mother, the man with the coke is here". The black gold turned white. Just use a simple recipy ... and coke turns into coal again. ["Koks": German for both "coal bricks" and "cocaine" (slang)] ["Kohle": German for both "coal" and "cash" (slang)] Mother, the man with the coke is here. Yes, I know, my dear. You got everything in Gars an artist needs. That?s not the point, Billy. I paid taxes in Austria for all of my life, a fortune, which was okay, but now it?s over. Hans, I?m not an expert in the biz, but will you be able to record in the jungle? Why not? I think you?re running away. From your critics, from the press maybe. They treated you badly. In this case I?d have left years ago. You listen to the wrong people, Hans. They pretend to care, but they don?t give a fuck. And who is that? You know that. Look - in the Dominican Republic ... you?re away from the world ... away from big cities ... You?re wrong. I can record over there. Come on. Reconsider, please! I sent my mother first. She liked it, so I?m here. - What do you say? - I like it. - You have to like it. - I do. I?ll change a few things, then it?s fine. I told you on the phone ... I think we should part ... businesswise ... You don?t need an expensive manager right now. Dude, tell it like it is. My last album bombed years ago. "Coke" was a short-lifed high, the company laughed the other demos off. I don?t care. Artist, producer, label, manager ... I?m the only one left in the cab. I can still look in the mirror. I?m sure your time isn?t over. Where would I be if I had listened to you? But I didn?t. You can?t fight fate. Neither can you alter it. I?d have had less fun for sure. I only live once ... and how I live it once is enough. I have a wish. Stop drinking. And the other stuff. Will you stay for my 40th birthday? Those who don?t get it now, will never. The stars are different for us. In falling and lying it is that we?re really living. Dammit, we?re still alive. Still. At Christmas I?ll fly home. We can meet in Vienna. During midterm break you can come here. If you want to ... and your mother agrees. It will be snowing in Austria while we?re in the pool. That would be great. Hopefully mum agrees. - I?ll talk to her. - Shame we hardly see each other. We?ll phone more often, okay? That?s something. Do you mind me calling you "daddy"? No, but "Hans" is more suitable. - As you like. - You?re my daddy, I?m proud of you. Come on. The important thing is to know who you are and what you want. Also that we like each other. I love you. Do you remember when we played chess in the old apartment and you threw all pieces around? Sure. Mom was angry. But you gave me chocolate. Mum was angry at you. I know. And now? What does she say about me? Nothing really. Not much. She looks for you in the papers. Really? Yes. I always enjoy our talks. Daddy ... Hans ... We will talk again soon. Sleep well in the Carribean. Greetings to your mother. I will. - Bye. - Bye. Round yon Virgin Mother and Child, Holy Infant so tender and mild, Sleep in heavenly peace Sleep in heavenly peace I can?t remember such a peaceful, joyful Christmas Eve. True. It was nice. Billy?s parents are old now. They?re nice people. Billy wants to sell the business? You gotta be able to finish things to start all over. Like in a relationship. It?s really tough. But it makes you strong and straight. He?s the undercover agent, the private clubbing patient, on an ego rearrangment mission, all the girls believe that. Anything to drink, Mr. Falco? Whiskey, dearest. You can leave the whole bottle. Light years of luxury, in vain, hard pulse in the stomach stays. He knows, she?ll do ... ... it tonight, and then she?ll be ... captain of the night flight. Maria H?lzel has been living in a Viennese old age home for some years. Billy Filanowski works as a real estate agent. Markus Spiegel is a music business advisor. Horst Bork is still active as a manager. Carolina-Tanja learned a profession in Graz. Jacqueline A. never appeared in public again. Falco was buried in a Honorary Tomb in Vienna on February 14th 1998, 5 days before his 41st birthday. His estate was converted into the Falco Foundation. I can?t get enough of you, you?re in every breath I take, everything revolves around you, why was it me? I?m counting hours and seconds, time seems to stand still, I tortured and twisted myself, let me go - what more do you want? Do you want to count my days, why do you have to torture me with my desire? Your hell burns in me, you?re the drink of survival to me, I?m torn apart, when will you come to kiss my wounds? Do you hear the voice saying ... Do you hear the voice saying ... I?m ready, it is time for our pact on eternity, You?re close to me, I can feel you, Let me seduce you, kidnap you, let me surrender to you one last time tonight, Give me your hand, my life, announce the price, I?ll give you yesterday, today, tomorrow, then the circle will close, The point of no return, the white light closes in, I want to surrender, do I have to die to live on?
