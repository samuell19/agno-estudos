♪ ♪ Grandpa, did you go on being a sailor after the Titanic sank? Oh, no. Once I hit New York, I got a new job. I would never have stopped being a sailor. Why did it sink if it was the most wonderful ship in the world, huh, Grandpa? It was well built, wasn't it? Mm-hmm, the best ship ever seen. Listen to what it says in this old paper. "Tragic ending to the maiden voyage of the Titanic. The liner goes down. Hundreds missing." A lot of people died, huh? Well, youngster, it's a long, complicated story. The truth of the matter is that those missing persons were never really missing. It's all a misunderstanding. One of these days, I'll tell you the whole story. Huh? No, tell us now. Please, Grandpa. Now, now, now, now, please. Come on now, kids, relax. Don't make such a fuss. Grandpa, what was this whistle used for? You put that down right now. It's dangerous. It's just an old whistle. Hand it over. This was used for calling the terrible Mr. Ice! -Who? -Who? Why was he so terrible? Huh? Ice was a cruel and merciless monster. All right, all right, youngsters. You've talked me into it. I'll tell you the whole story, if you'll behave yourselves, that is. Why, sure. Uh-huh. I still say she was the most beautiful ship that ever plowed the waves.

Got it. Good. We skim up that, uh--uh, hawser and run real fast up it. And if we hold on tight, we won't fall off into the water. I'll die of cold if that happens.

I was, um, simply admiring the masterful way in which you're carrying out this operation. Yes, things are proceeding smoothly. There's no reason whatsoever why the Duke shouldn't grant me exclusive worldwide whaling rights. Not to mention the hand of his darling daughter. By marrying her, you'll get your mitts on all of his money, won't you, boss? Sorry. (laughs) That's quite all right, Jeffries. You've hit the nail on the head. There's nothing in the world that counts besides money and power. Everything else is simply there to be used to achieve those objectives. Still here? Hurry, man, hurry!

(both chattering) ♪ Friends, sailors, fellow travelers, welcome aboard the Titanic, the most magnificent ship now afloat. Probably every seagoing rodent in the world envies us right now, but remember, not all that glitters is gold. The problem is this ship is new and has never been past a review by the mouse inspection board. As we know, men are greedy and all too likely to cheat on construction and materials. So for the first few days, be careful how you move about. The good news is that the food on board will be abundant thanks to our official vittler, Jean Luc Camembert. Bonjour, mes amis! It's a pleasure to see you all here. We can count ourselves lucky to have a professional of Jean Luc's stature aboard. Now, just a minute before you go. Wait, wait! One last thing, friends, and very important too. My network has informed me that the humans have brought on board not only several dogs, but unfortunately two cats as well. (gasping) Sounds great! Good food and cats. I'm really going to enjoy this crossing. Ronnie, Ronnie, don't play with fire. I've seen them, you haven't. Those are snooty cats belonging to rich people, the kind who kill just for the pleasure of it, not because they're hungry. You heard what the captain said. Promise me you'll be very careful, all right? Hey, let's go check out the dining room, huh? Oh, see you, Stella. Oh, Mr. Connors. Yes? Ronnie's a bit of a gadabout, but I know I can count on you not to let him get into trouble. (laughs) Thank you so much. See you! (indistinct chatter) Oh! Well, good evening, Maltravers. Your Grace, what a pleasure. Sorry for being late. I was working and didn't realize the hour. Elizabeth, you look more enchanting than ever. Not only is it the best ship in the world, but it has the finest cuisine too. Captain, have you met Mr. Maltravers? Yes, this morning. I never even knew places like this existed. And I thought I'd seen everything. No crumbs of sweepings for us on this trip. It's gonna be one long banquet. Don't go getting any of your crazy ideas, Ronnie. I promised your beautiful sister I'd take good care of you. I don't want to lose any sleep over you, get it? Oh, it's splendid, isn't it? Indeed, my dear. Those dishes are full of good things. And I'm just dying of hunger. We'll feast on the leftovers later. What if they eat everything? -Huh? -Oh. Ladies and gentlemen, I propose a toast to the most famous young couple of the moment, Lady Elizabeth Camden and Mr. Everard Maltravers. Ah, Elizabeth and I are moved and honored, Captain. Thank you, sir. Oh, wouldn't it be wonderful if they married aboard the Titanic. The whole world would talk about it. Everyone who counts, that is. Don't you think it would be just incredible, my dear? Incredible isn't the right word. What would be incredible would be if someone were to ask my opinion on the matter that concerns me so closely. Always joking, our little girl. (laughs) I've never been more serious. And now if you'll excuse me, I feel a touch of seasickness coming on. I think a breath of fresh air would do me good. Please go on without me. Wait, please. Lady Elizabeth, I had no intention of upsetting you. Please forgive me. I had no idea. It's not your fault, Captain. Please sit down. Have a brandy. Really, dearest, you must do something about that girl. No true lady should ever behave that way. I don't like that woman, not one little bit I don't! She's as beautiful as a picture, and as fiery as the feijoada carioca. You can't be serious. Her? That old witch in the feathered hat? Of course not! I mean the one who left. Ahh. I'll see her in my dreams for the rest of my life. (laughs) I hate to be a spoilsport, but I would like to draw to your attention the fact that she's a woman and you're a mouse! Well, there's one thing I'm not, and that's a racist. That girl is a masterpiece of beauty, and we Brazilians always appreciate beauty. Let's go help her against that witch. ♪ ♪ You can wish on a star if you try ♪ ♪ Time will say goodbye ♪ Time is slowly fading away Hello there! Huh? Yes, you!

We added a little magic of our own and voilà! The spell was cast. Only now, you really must stop crying, my dear. Yes, please, or you'll drown us. (laughing) Wow! What a jumper! Oh! And what a hitter. Oh, you mean you really care about me? Did you hear that, Ronnie? I knew she was a nice lady, and I knew she was in trouble. Now thanks to this magic, we can understand each other, and we'll really be able to help her. They're--they're incredible. They're fantastic! What are you talking about? These guys don't realize they're sitting on a gold mine. I don't know what you mean, Ronnie. With the elevation they get in their jumps, they could score goals from all over the soccer field. If I could turn into a dolphin like you, that would make me happier than anything in the world. I'd be free to roam the oceans and not have to worry about evil men and wicked women. Then I'd have no reason in the world to cry. If you were in my place, young lady, you'd have no time to cry. We're engaged in a desperate battle to save the lives of our friends, the whales!

It will be a catastrophe. The whales will be massacred unless there's some sort of miracle. ♪ Milord. Mr. Maltravers. As I was saying, Your Grace, my entire fleet is ready to set sail. At this moment, there are dozens of ships sitting idle in the ports and costing me a pretty penny to boot. Mm, yes, I quite see the problem. Yes, indeed. And since your daughter and I are to be married, I could ask for no finer wedding present, Your Grace, than the exclusive rights to all your whaling territories around the globe. You will have a happy son-in-law able to make your daughter that much happier. Well, there's no great hurry, is there? Either for the concession or the wedding. I wish you a pleasant night, Maltravers. (growls) Boss, I just saw Lady Elizabeth. Damnation! One way or another, I'll have that whaling concession signed and sealed if it's the last thing I ever do. Send wires to all my captains immediately. Order them to begin the hunt. You got it, boss. Just a minute. Advise our special friend to keep himself ready for action, and don't lose sight of Lady Elizabeth for a minute. You must become her shadow. Do you understand-- her shadow!

I'll never sit at that table again as long as Everard is there. You'll never get anywhere by running away from it. You ought to face the issue squarely and tell your father and Everard what you think. It's the only way. (sighs) My father's under Rachel's thumb totally. Hmm. Listen, you can't just give in like that. This game isn't even in the second half yet. You've got to fight! Of course I'm going to fight.

Of course I'll see her again. It's up to me to make it happen, that's all. (barks) I can't spend the whole voyage curled up in a ball grousing to the world at large and pining for her, now, can I? So she's not dining with us tonight either? This is intolerable. I shall go have a word with my wayward daughter and see what's going on in her silly little head. That stupid little chit is going to ruin everything we've been working for! And that imbecile I married is going to help her. I must speak to Everard at once. You stay here. Thank you.

Let's get going. (moaning) Come on, slowpoke! Whee, here I come! (laughs) Oh, I almost forgot. We'll come back and make our report as agreed, but there's one thing you have to do in exchange. Get out of this state room for a while. If you want those whaling rights, you have to convince the old fool that Elizabeth's in love with you. How can we do that, though? She's so stubborn! What do you think? You're right. I'm beginning to think my fascinating charisma isn't up to par these days. Fascinating like a rattlesnake. Shh, quiet. Your charisma's not in dispute, dear Everard. It's just that my stepdaughter's too stupid to see it. But I think I have a plan that will salvage our business affairs. Fortunately, our affairs aren't limited to business. Those filthy schemers! Now, what's this idea? The expression on your face. You'll tell him you've ironed out your misunderstandings, and you'll get him to sign over that miserable concession before he's had time to talk to her. Your Grace, yet another of your marvelous ideas. And if you continue to help me like this, I see a rosy future ahead for us. Hurry! We have to warn Elizabeth! Let's go! Oh. -Are you sure? -Yes!

You seem a little nervous. Huh? I'm plenty nervous. Look over there. It's Ice and his gang. Yo, Orcy. What are you and your gang doin' in our territory, Ice? We got a problem, and we're looking for Tentacles' advice. What sort of problem? What are you talkin' about anyway? Well, let's just call it a bet. A couple of my boys think they can heave an iceberg farther than Tentacles can. That sounds like great fun! Oh, I know you're the strongest thing around, Tentacles. Don't get me wrong, but these guys think they can beat you anyway. They're welcome to try. (laughter) Oh, you're such a good sport. Oh, sure, Ice. I can't wait to start. (laughs) You're terrific, kid. Why don't we start with somethin' easy, you know? Just to limber up the muscles. What do you say? I say let's get going. (laughs) Tentacles, there's something suspicious going on here. I've never seen a shark playin' a game in my life. You worrywart. Get a couple of the boys and grab that pint-sized, nosy, skunk-colored, so-called killer whale and lock him up in the old shipwreck, but make sure nobody sees you. (groaning) ♪ Yeah. ♪ (groaning) He bought it. (laughs) Sucker. ♪ (all cheering) I got to hand it to you, Tentacles, you're Mr. Muscles, all right. Oh, you think so? But it really wasn't so tough. Well, I'm impressed, kid. Now, um, you feel like trying your hand at something heavier? Sure, I'd love to. Let's go. Attaboy! Now, let's go for a real record breaker. What do you say? Tentacles, help! Here we are. I certainly hope this works. (barking) Come on in. Hello there. How about a nice treat? Huh? Here. Good catch. I'll bet one's not enough for you, right? Smiley, the message is under the cookie bag. (laughs) Yay! ♪ (cat yowling) Oh no, oh no. Stay. (cat yowling) Got you now. There. Ooh. What a way to... make a measly buck. Got you. They ought to give that man a medal. Not a medal, a monument. (laughter) Two monuments. I regret to tell you this, Maltravers, but the wedding will not take place after all. I appreciate your frankness, My Lord. Furthermore, in all honesty, I must confess to being somewhat perplexed regarding some of the details in your whaling proposal. However, I'm quite prepared to take a look at the documents. They're in my state room, My Lord. We can go over them together. Well, well, then. Lead the way, my dear fellow. (barking) There's Smiley. That must be the message. Hey. Good dog, Smiley. Attaboy. It can't be true. Huh? I'm sure Father would never have given him the whaling rights. We have to speak with him. Come on. Take it easy, Duke. Nothing will happen to you. Why don't you sit down, My Lord? (grunts) You deaf? Now, if you'll condescend to take a look at these papers, I'm sure you'll find that there's nothing missing. Well, there is one thing missing, and that's your aristocratic John Hancock! Do I make myself clear? Yes indeed, but I'll never sign them. (laughs) I think you will. You're wrong, sir. Wrong. Sign them. Sign. Sign them now, you old goat. Sign them, or I'll kill that stupid presumptuous daughter of yours and the silly prancing gypsy dancer she's so fond of! Better do it, Duke. (laughs) ♪ (knocking at door) Come in. ♪ Oh. Jeffries, the rope. You got it, boss. Dear me, this is turning out to be an unfortunate evening for you, my lord. (laughs) Sign this other document, and we'll pretend we're parting good friends. We could've been millionaires, but you had to be an obstinate fool to the bitter end. Come on, now, sign it. Sign it! ♪ (laughter) If you had accepted me as a son-in-law, none of this would have happened, old chum. ♪ It's getting late, ladies, shall we? You've just signed your last will and testament, my dear, and I'm the beneficiary. ♪ See that, boss? I got him trussed up like a chicken. Don't be a simpleton, Jeffries. There's no time to lose. (whines) (barking) Oh! ♪ All right, boys, do not betray the slightest hint of nervousness or anxiety. (all cheering) Shucks. That overgrown cuttlefish is playing right into our hands. Now all I got to do is to get him to heave an even bigger one, and it's bye-bye, Titanic. (cackles) Hey, boss, I've just been checkin' out the situation on the surface. The Titanic will be right where you want her in a couple minutes from now. Good, very good. (laughs) Action. Gotta hand it to you, kid. You've almost won the bet. Only almost? Yes, 'cause only if you throw a seriously huge hunk of ice can I call you the winner and hire you as head of my own elite guard unit. Got it, kid? Well, if I had your cap, I guess I could give it a try. All right, all right. You want the cap, you got the cap. But first, you got to heave that iceberg over there exactly 118 yards east by northeast. Yeah, that one over there. Go to work, kid. Hey, w--gi--give me back my cap! I told you you could have it after you threw the berg. Not before. There are more important things right now. Yeah, right, never mind. Okay, keep the cap, but you don't get the job until you throw the berg. Well, fair's fair after all. I'll try. ♪ ♪ Well, now I can wear this hat with honor. Huh? Where did they all go? You really did it this time, Tentacles. Yeah, I think I beat my own record. All right, boys, block that rudder! Don't you realize what you've done? I beat the sharks at ice throwing! You threw an iceberg at a ship full of people! I don't know how many of them we'll be able to save! They'll freeze to death in these waters. You really did it this time, kid. Oh, no! (crying) Easy does it, Jeffries, you bumbling idiot. (barking) Oh! What's going on? Faster, Jeffries, faster! Sound the alarm, Mr. Craig. Four passengers are stealing a lifeboat. Yes, sir.

My place is with my ship, and I'll go down with her. Just make sure you get an S.O.S. sent out before you disembark, Mr. Craig. Good luck, gentlemen, and farewell. We're in terrible trouble, laddies. (indistinct shouting) There's only one thing we can hope for. They're sure to send out an S.O.S. Maybe there's a ship near enough that can make it in time to help us. Oh, the telegraph! Oh, my goodness, we cut the wire. And you didn't repair it after? That's against every rule in the Sea Mouse Maritime Union! Do you realize what you've done, you little fools? (indecipherable shouting) ...that I shall live to see such a day! (crying) I guess we can try and fix it. You're right, and that's just what you're going to do, or I'll have the hides off you! Are you still here? -On our way! -Whee! If they fail, it's Davy Jones' Locker for us all. ♪ Oh! Ooh! ♪ You go find whoever you can and start splicing those wires. I'll go look for Camembert.

We have to fix the telegraph wires! If we don't reconnect the wires, they can't send out the S.O.S. We will have to think of something, won't we? (groaning) We just can't make ends meet. Oh, no. We're too late. Send out an S.O.S. Give our position and then abandon ship. Aye-aye, sir. It's now or never, guys. You gotta make it work. Oh, no! I've got it!
