Yeah, good, good! Come on! Stop clinging on me. Come here. You go girl! I love that t-shirt. Me too. Martina, what do you think about yourself? I'd kill for a fuck. When you are out, you can fuck anybody you want. I want Roman, no one else. Are you nuts? He does not give a shit about you anymore. You will call this off! You will call this off! Yeah, right. Cunt. Let go! You let go. Open up, open up! Cunt, come here. What are you doing, let go of me! Come out! At least let me wipe my ass. Ouch, let go. Take it back, take it back! You think he has been just spanking this whole year he was out? Let go! Take it back! You know the girls in Prague are posh. Take it back! OK. OK. I'm taking it back! Good for you girl. I am his Shakira. Anyway, you won't give a shit about me once you are out of here. You won't remember me after a year. Here you go you puppy. Are you crazy you dyke? I was watching out. You promised a whole one. Don't be rude. It's an honor to guard us. Thanks a lot. I got shit everywhere. What are you doing you cow? You better not tell anybody. Let's go! Maybe I'll tell, maybe I won't. Go and wash my socks. Come on, let's do it, here... Why did you turn it off? Hey Shakira! What color is your bra? What for? I got everything nice and hard, not like yourself. Oh you would be surprised. If you'd see the elephant... What elephant? Here are the ears. And you pull out the trunk yourself. I'm gonna get my tweezers. I am going mad in here. Me too. Think some parent got nostalgic? It's probably a new one. When I imagine another year, it makes me wanna vomit. Don't get hysterical. I'll be calling you. You should have come half past. Today is a long awaited day for you Martina. You are an adult so I hope you'll behave like a respectful citizen. The state and us in the service have made it possible. ...for you to have a decent home and education. I don't have much time, so I will be brief. I don't want to miss lunch because of you. Me neither. My dear Martina Potockova. Being late does not pay off in real life either. So here are your release papers. Here is your ID card. Here is your health card. Do not lose it. And here you have your mother's address. As you know, your father is anonymous. I don't know, how up to date this address is. Your mother doesn't communicate. She has never showed any interest in you. I recommend you promptly... Sign up at the social bureau. Oh, Martina. You will get double today. We know you are leaving. So will you miss us? Terribly! So you enjoy Martina. Why do you laugh like idiots? It will be quiet in here! This is revenge. I'll eat it if you don't want. Explain. You are so small and you stuff yourself the most. You are like a snake. Unlike yourself I am getting tall. Stop it. This is my day. I'm sorry. Sorry. So tell us. What did she tell you at the administrative? Regular brain wash. That agriculture is a fab school and the state loves me. Why are you crying you cow? Leave me alone you lesbo. So... Do you know where you will go? Where should I go? Of course to join Roman in Prague. -So how much did they give you? -That ain't your problem. Wow, I have never seen so much money. Look, that's the new one. His name is Igor. I heard he was adopted when young and... and his step father has... That's hardcore. He does not talk to anyone. Iveta. Go and sit next to him. Why me? Don't you see he is alone? -Hi. -Hi. Can I sit next to you? You danced good. I know. I'm curious if he hasn't changed out there. Roman? Don't be foolish. He wouldn't change. You think so? Happy birthday. I made it myself. It's great. It's for your good luck. I am fat and ugly. There will be no one waiting for me outside. Yes there will be. I will be waiting for you. I will miss you so much. -Lesbians. -Where do you think you are going? I just came to ask: when are you gonna start packing? When I want to. Why are you rude again. Well, just whether you are taking everything. No one takes everything. What I leave goes to Jana. You are a great friend. Touching. I am curious how you fit in when you are so fat. Get out! Are you really going to wait for me? I will wait. And I will pick you up in my own car. Leave me alone. -Why are you clinging onto me? -Don't shit yourself you romantic. Cigarettes. Cigarettes! Which ones? The usual of course. I don't have change. That ain't my problem. Don't you steel anything. What are you staring at? I wanna remember how I don't want to end up. The damn cab driver gave me a tour, I missed it! Yeah. I am telling you I missed it! Hi love. I am in Prague already. I'll try again later, I am really looking forward to you. Bye. So what? Should I hop on my dick and fly? Next one comes in 4 hours. I'm telling you. Hello. Hot dog. Hot dog? Do you want it with ketchup or mustard? How do you like it? So two, one with mustard, one with ketchup. Two? Great choice. So... One for the lady... With mustard. And one hot dog for the lady... With ketchup. Your change back. Thanks, good bye. Have a good one. Oh shit. Fuck. Hello? Venco? This is Martina. From Roman. Hold on please. He gave me your number... That I can call you if I can't reach him. Yes. Six months? Thanks, thanks, bye. What is it going to be? One tea. The ice cream shop is next door. Was Roman here already today? I was told Blackie comes here. Look tight ass. I ain't no fucking information point. You wait and you will see. Hi. Hi, five beers. Fuck. Don't you know who's table this is? -That one was looking for Blackie. -Which one? Back there. -What did she want? -Don't know. Look, now Onion is hovering around her. I need some player for my daughter. Sure, no problem. Want any money? You joking? Get the fuck out Onion. Take the fucking beer. What do you want from Blackie? Do you know him? Perhaps. I'm his girlfriend. Is Roman going to be here today? I don't know. Everybody does what he wants... You got a name? Shakira. Toudy. What are you doing? Do you know him well? Yeah, quite well. If you want we can wait for him together. -So? -Alright. I was at the main station today. -That dick was there, the cop. -Don't spit on me. He was there with his mama and little son. -Dude, you are spitting so much. -She is so ugly... -Now I know why he chases whores. - Move over a bit. Do you need to shout? I am not deaf! -Move over. -What's up? This is Shakira. Blackie's girlfriend. So they walk past me and the fucking bastard says... Look son, do you see that junkie? Don't you end up like him! And the little one started crying... Cunt that's what I say. Death to the police state. A fag is better for a father, better than a cop. Or a whore for a mother, huh? You think your mom would sleep with me as well? You cunt. I will jump over the table and show you who's the cunt here! Leave it and calm yourself. I'm telling you to calm down. -You calm down as well! -I'm ok. We'll finish the drinks and go, everything is set up, cheers. Hey that is my beer. Move your head just a little. That will do, that's great. Dick, dude. You cunt. What are you laughing at? So I pissed all over my hand. Go and fuck off. Get lost. Wait. You dickheads. -Go! Go you boldfaced ass. -What happened? You are from the foster home too? -What a couple of retards. -I'm not ready. Watch out! You keep fucking around. The cops will screw you. Go, go hurry. Hurry. Go! -Your shoes smell so bad! -Hi. Hi, Toudy. Can you back me up, I am really fucked. -I'll pay back tomorrow, please. -I know you too well. Toudy, come on man. My parents are leaving for a holiday. -They changed the locks ages ago. -I will steal grandma's key I swear. Please, please I swear. Prodigy, come here! -What's up? A problem? -No, no, it's all right. Here you go. Make sure you get me some good player, understood? -Tomorrow! -Understood. Of course Toudy, thanks. You are the greatest. Really good player. Get lost. -Please, just be calm, ok? -You know I am a cool hand. Yeah, exactly, I know you. Hey Cassandra, hey girls, nice, nice. Greetings. What's up? I got some stuff here. Here, see, oh gee thanks a lot. What else? -What? -More. -What more? -More means more, an increase. -Get lost. -Shit am I an idiot or what? -Hey, hey! -Whom you talking to? I'm not going to fight... -Leave him alone, hey! - Be calm, be cool. Be cool guys, calm, peace. -Peace, peace, come here, idiot. -Nice jacket... nice jacket. He is a dick, he is such a dick. What do you think you are doing? I didn't make it, I couldn't. I couldn't... can you back me up? -You think I am a bank? -Get out of the way. -Hi, sorry. -Hi. I think I got something for you. Three. Which one is it? The one by the column. Call her. Come here. Not you. You, come here. -Sorry about that idiot. -It's nothing. Ah... Little angel. What's up? We'll go and take a leak. Let's go! What's your name? Shakira. Shakira! Shakira. -Do you have a place to live? -That's my problem. Alright, alright, alright. Pen, you dick. If you think it over. Give me a call. OK? I'll even find you a job. Let's go! Shakira. I am Santa Claus. Yeah, you for sure. Bald-headed dick. What's up boys? Cold, isn't it? You don't have a good job. -Shakira, what are you doing here? -Roman, I couldn't reach you. They stole my phone you know. -What? -Nothing! The air is clean, you can fuck! Shit, why are you bothering... wait. -What? -My phone... Hello? -It's for you. -For me? Hello? Shakira, wait a minute, shit! Shakira, wait. What are you staring at? And wouldn't you want me? So where are you? Paris, do you hear me? You are not going to believe who is with me. Yeah, yes. Yes, and he didn't change a bit. We also found each other with Edo. Yeah, I just left the bathroom. You will fuck like rabbits. Who's there? I got to hang up. Paris? Hello? Roman. Everything is alright? Let's get out of here. Where? To your place... You know some things didn't work out... Not quite so... So I don't have a place to stay. I have money. -Roman! -What's up? Roman! Let's go ride the big one! -Forget it. -No, let's go! -Let's ride that one. -I've never been... So what? I've never ridden on a Ferris wheel either. This was a gift for good luck. I am not going to need it anymore. Sorry. Imagine that my mother lives in Kladno. That's not far, is it? Did you go and see you father? I could shit on him. Why? Will you go and see her? And should I? I would go. Maybe she is rich. Perhaps she is nice. If she was nice, she wouldn't have put me in a foster home. What if her bad conscience is eating at her? That's a return ticket? Are you afraid I won't come back? I wouldn't be surprised. I don't even have a place to take you. Prague really is expensive. I talked with Mikes, he could find us a flat for one thousand. I don't believe that guy. Well, we wouldn't have to pay the hostel. It would be cheap. -And for how long? -I did not ask. At least for six months. OK. -So... -Here, you get some food. -No, it's ok, I will manage. -Here you go. Hey, don't you know where Maria Horvatova lives? Horvatova. Horvatova... There, down on the first floor. Hi. -Does Maria Horvatova live here? -Yes. Mom! What's going on? I'm coming. Get running. What do you want? So, what's going on? Me... -Are you from some bureau? -No... -No I am not from a bureau. -So he did something wrong? -Did you do something bad? -No... no. I am... You are from Slovakia, aren't you. I am probably your daughter. -What do you want from me? -I don't want anything. I can make you a coffee. OK? OK. Take your shoes off here. Zdeno. Zdeno. Zdeno. I have a visitor. Stop it Rendo, for fuck sake. I told you. Come on. Are you a baboon or what? Shit, it will be quiet in here! One can't focus on nothing in here. So I read here, you were in, Biele Vody. Biele Vody... a hole in the ground. Name they gave you... Martina. Martina... I would have given you a different name. A more interesting one... Dasha or Elen. I thought you gave me my name. And when did you leave? Day before yesterday. You can't live here. My husband is sick, you know. We live hand-to-mouth. I have a boyfriend. We want to live in Prague together. Is he my father? No... I don't know his name... We made you at a disco club. Do you like dancing? Yes? You see, that is why. He probably does not know who I am? He does not know. And he is not going to find out. One is ashamed of such things. Why did you make me then? Exactly, I was not making you, it was a mistake. What's this guy want?...you know. Can I make a phone call? I don't have any credit. If you want to call, there is a phone outside in the housing project. Boys, food, wash hands. Do you eat pasta? You like pasta? Come closer, chop chop, do you want any? Martina. Sorry, sorry. One more time? Oh, I see, sure, wait a minute. Here, operator passes the call! Not for you dumb ass. So, how did it go? Is she loaded with cash? She has two kids, you know. I have two brothers. She has a weird man. I can stay over for the night. Yeah. I miss you. What about the flat? I am working on it. Hello? Are you there? Roman? Damn it. Pour tall shots! For everyone, on me! -I must have heard wrong. -You heard right, shots for everyone. Alright! Get the large shots here! -Pour! -You owe me already. I'll pay you, come on. I told you to pour. Enough you cunt? -Why are you making a mess? -I was knocking. You think that when someone's nice to you at the bus stop... ...that you will be sticking around or what. Get out or I will smack you, you stupid cow. Hey! Lady where are you going? -To the room. -Just a moment! You left in the morning, right? And if you want a room, you have to pay in the evening. That means we have a flat! -Sorry, was Blackie in here? -Watch your step! -I know you're not the information... -I threw them out about an hour ago. So what, Praha, Praha, Prague is nice, yeah? Prague, beer, did you have beer? You don't care for beer, you came for something else, I get you. So look... here we are... it's whore-street here. Look, every one that walks goes for money... a whore Whore Avenue, a drive through... one after another. Ah you want... yeah? How much? It's nothing for you, you got it free. You will pay me more for the ride. Hey, what about that gypsy? You like Gypsy? Do you fancy gypsies? I heard they are warmer... inside... by one degree. What? No? Something else, white meat? What about that one? Wait, I will make a deal. Come over! Come over. Come over please. -I got some dough for you here. -You have what? I got dough for you, get in. You are making money, I got a great hard dick for you here. -Get in. -I am not a whore! -Idiot! -What are you doing you cunt! Don't make me run after you. It's ok dude, I will get another. Come and shit myself! Madame came back to the Hilton? Where is Roman? Forget Roman, screw with me! No, no, no, I heard he has something with Mikes. With Mikes, dude. Ran out of money? -Worry about yourself. -Relax, you can always whore some. If only I had such pussy... If only... -What do you know about my pussy? -Sorry, I did not mean it. Give me the wine. It will warm you up. Did you hear what Chip did? He stole a car instead of a player and he fell asleep inside. That's so gay, right? He's being mom in the prison now. Exactly, he's a fag. Won't you go with me and get warm? -Toudy, leave me alone. -Shit, leave her alone. The girl is not interested. Right? You did not change your mind? -Marek, I won't sleep with you either. -Cool... I am going to sleep anyway. -Marek... -What are you laughing at you homo? Yeah, give it to her real bad! All she can take... Jiz in her pussy you brutal one. Do it just like to his mother! Whose mother? -Relax, calm yourself. -Do you see now? I am telling you. -You are paranoid. -He's paranoid, I'm gonna kill him. I will smack him bad. Did you think it over? We can go. I will keep you warm. Toudy let me be. Sorry, I mean well. You should get used to it. Shakira, Shakira, come. Get up, shit, get up. Come. -Roman, you are here. -Come. -Come. -I am so cold. Where are we going? Roman. Come. -So they found us the flat? -Come! Look, I have two balls, square ones. Two sixes, I won. Ouch! You won, you won! Idiot. You can judge, you are my master... -So take care of it, don't fuck up. -OK. Princess, where are you going? Go with them, ok? I thought you wanted to see the flat. -I don't have the whole day for you. -Yes. There is a blanket in the trunk. You're shaking like shit on a shoelace. He will join us later. He wanted a flat, he has a flat. He wanted a job, he has to work. Princess, we are here. Are you testing my good side? We will have beautiful legs. -It's on the third floor. -We will never forget this favor. I told you I am Santa Claus. We are people, we have to help one another, right? We are here. As if you were home little girl. Coffee! So what do you say? So? Nice flat. -Can I? -Yes, of course! You will fall in love with it. Let's have a coffee, it brings people together. I don't drink coffee. Seat yourself. Two? No, twelve you asshole. Oh, coffee, wonderful. You should give it a try. First, you have to smell the coffee. Are you from the foster home like your boy-friend? I heard you visited your mother, did it go well? Yeah. She lives her own life. -We have each other with Roman. -Well, now you have us as well. -That's going to be Roman. -Sit down. Open the door, prick. -Hi Gucci. -Hi. Gucci, hi. Coffee? She is nice, nice, good. -What are you doing? -Get naked! My God, she is good, she has a good pussy. I'm taking her. Give her some stuff. Little girl. For peeing. Go and wash yourself. Leave the door open! I told you open, they didn't teach you to listen in the foster home? You don't know what open means? When I say open, it means open! No one will joke with me, understand? Open is open. Open! Understand? Open! You will like it you will see. Shout. Shout! Shout! You have never been so wet! You thought you would skip me... That's all they gave you at the hospital? Three rules. First. Be back by nine. I lock the door then. Second, if I find out... Drugs, booze, anything, you are out. Third, you got to work hard here, understand? -I don't hear anything. -Yes, I understand. Work bureau, social bureau, that's your business. We work for the city, one who works has a bed. Now you are lucky, it's not freezing. Well, some... would rather freeze to death, than give up drinking. Dining room. Lidunka, bon appetit. And what is the food like? Everyone cooks for him/herself. Hide your toilet paper. Toilets... Are here. There is only one shower here. It's not used much. Just in case, lock the door from the inside. Damn. I was traveling you know. Well... Here and there.
