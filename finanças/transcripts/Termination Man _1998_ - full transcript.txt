(insects chirring) (suspenseful music) - [Sergeant] Company, move out. (static buzzing) (suspenseful music) Move, down. Prepare to fire. Fire on target. (gunshots booming) - [Corporal] Nice shooting, Tex. Looks like you started a fire. - [Sergeant] Pull back, soldier. - [Soldier] I'm just gonna stomp out the fire, Sarge. (static buzzing) (Geiger counter crackles) - Corporal, do you have a reading on that smoke? - Yes, sir, it's showing nothing, Sergeant. (hissing) (coughing) - [Sergeant] Check your seals, we're under attack. - [Corporal] I still don't get a reading, Sergeant. - [Sergeant] Comm, this is Black Arrow, Comm, come in. We are under gas attack, we need immediate extraction. This is not a drill; I repeat, this is not a drill. We are under gas attack. (static buzzing) Comm, We are under chemical attack. I repeat, We are under chemical attack. (groaning and coughing) - [Comm] Black Arrow, this is Comm, Black Arrow. Black Arrow, Black Arrow. (orchestral music) - Well, how's he doing? - Look. (birds twittering) 30 minutes. - 30 minutes? That's not bad. - 10 miles in 30 minutes; I'd say he's doin' pretty good. In fact, better than I'd hoped. He's stronger and faster; hey, Pope! - Yeah! - Are you tired? - Not at all! - All right then, be ready. We'll move on to the second part of the test. - Okay, what's that? (suspenseful music) (grunting) (blows thudding) (orchestral music) Good job, Pope. - Thanks. Morning, Cain. - How do you feel? - A little stiff. Nothing a weekend in Maui wouldn't cure. - Unlikely. - That's too bad. My tan's beginnin' to fade. - Pope, Joint Security Operations has invested a lot of money and resources into enhancing your abilities. I think it's time we put 'em to good use, don't you? - Guess that means no trip to Maui, huh? - [Sergeant] Comm, this is Black Arrow; Comm, come in. We are under gas attack, we need immediate extraction. This is not a drill, I repeat, this is not a drill. We are under gas attack, do you read? Comm. - Black Arrow, this is Comm, Black Arrow! - What you just heard took place eight hours ago on a UN peacekeeping patrol in Bosnia. The chemical pierced the protective suits, and they were dead in less than a minute. - What was the chemical? - We don't know. It left very few traceable deposits. - Do you want me to find out where it came from? - Oh, we know where it came from. - I am Commander Yurdovich, of Serbian Independence Organization. We are responsible for launching the deadly chemical offensive against UN forces deployed here. We are demanding the United Nations remove all troops from our region. If the UN fails to comply with our demands, we will be forced to begin an aggressive campaign against all non-Serbian forces. I am granting the UN 72 hours to begin the withdrawal. - Yurdovich is a former Special Forces operative. One day, he just cleared out his desk and left. For a couple of years, even the CIA couldn't find him. But they finally did. - I'm supposed to take him out? - Ah, that'd be too easy. And it wouldn't stop his men from launching the gas. - What would? - You. - Why did I know that? - If the UN were to pull out, Yurdovich's group would overrun all of former Yugoslavia. The Joint Security Organization and the UN are calling an emergency meeting before Yurdovich's deadline. You will go to the region and disarm Yurdovich's chemical weapons before the end of that meeting. This is Agent Delilah Shane. - [Pope] Where'd you find her, Cain? - [Cain] Our MIT recruitment program. - MIT, huh? - She's better than good, Pope. You're the only one who can get close to those weapons. We think the enhancements to your body will keep you from being affected by the chemical. - What if they don't? - Then it's a one-way trip. - Fair enough. At least I'll have her all to myself. - Not quite. Dylan Pope, Agent Ted Marks. - Pleasure. - How you doin'? - Gentlemen, these radios are excellent for short-range communication. The scrambling technology is state of the art. And this shirt here is equipped with smoke-bomb buttons. Just snap 'em off, press both sides to activate. (explosion booming) Standard ballpoint pen. Twist the rear section counterclockwise, it becomes a laser. Press the retractor and... (laser sizzles) But please be careful. It could burn a hell of a lot more than a hole in your pocket. Camera with a built-in flash, except this is new, pay attention. You press the button, and it increases the flash power 500 times. Watch your eyes. It'll cause total blindness in five minutes. Now you should know about these. Mini-grenades, twist the cap to arm, and bam, in five seconds. Free anesthetic, free fragmentation. Excellent anti-personnel weapon. - Yeah, they came in real handy last couple places I worked. - Where'd you work? - Panama, Beirut, Los Angeles. - When you arrive at your destination, you'll come as tourists. Right above the port is a small castle. A restaurant, really. You'll find Agent Shane there. She'll arrange for you to meet up with a former KGB contact. Then he'll take you directly to Yurdovich's compound. And from there, gentlemen, you're on your own. - We're used to that. (orchestral music) She looks capable. - Don't they all? - Right there. (orchestral music) (ship's horn honks) (speaking faintly) (surf roaring) - Do you think she'd come down? - [Ted] I don't think so. - Nah, I don't either. (suspenseful music) - Hello. I'm Delilah Shane. - Ted Marks. - I'm your liaison. - I know it's politically incorrect, but you are beautiful. - You can save your charm, Agent Pope. Your reputation precedes you. Now I've arranged to have a car meet us in the next village. From there, we'll meet our next contact, who will lead us to Yurdovich's compound. - Sounds easy. - It never is. (suspenseful music) One o'clock! (gunshots booming) - Friends of yours? - Nope. (gunshots booming) (ominous music) Think they'll stand still for a photo? - [Ted] I think so. (gunshots booming) (beeping) (explosion booming) (yelling) (gunshots booming) (groaning) (body thuds) - I didn't think they'd be onto us so quickly. - You okay? - Yeah. - Did you pay the docking fee? (orchestral music) - All clear. - For now. (Delilah sighs) - You know, I bet those are some of Yurdovich's men back there. - I hope not. - Why? - Means there's a leak or a mole. - Don't know who to trust, huh? (orchestral music) - Now the car that's picking us up will meet us right over here at the market. - I hope we don't have to do much walking. - Hey, it's only about a block away. - Okay, we're all-American tourists. You and I will be a couple. Marks here can be my brother. - Okay. We're gonna take the front, so you watch our backs. - Anything else? - Listen, we're here to protect Pope and get him to his destination, and I happen to know this country. You got a better idea? - No offense meant. - None taken. Come on, let's go. (shoppers talking faintly) - Don't eat too many of those. - You and I'll work it off tonight. - Where's that car of yours? - Katrina's never failed me. She's from the old school, she's one of the best. - She'd better hurry, we're about to be ambushed. - Damn, you're good. - Instinct. (shoppers talking faintly) (gunshots booming) - Marks! (gunshots booming) - Damn. You're Ar-vee-ta? - No, I'm her niece, Natasha. - Would you be kind enough to get us the hell out of here? - Yes, of course. (tires squealing) (rooster squawks) (glass clattering) (tires squealing) (clamoring) - [Ted] Someone in central's on us, Pope. - [Pope] Yeah, I got the same feelin'. Duck! (suspenseful music) (gunshots booming) (groaning) (gunshots booming) (groaning) (somber music) (yelling) Bazooka! (explosion booming) You did good back there. - Just doin' my job. - Okay, I understand. Uh oh. - Roadblocks are common in this country. - Papers. - Please. - Is your name really Natasha? - [Natasha] Today, it is. - You from a fishing village? - No, my family was from Sarajevo, they sent me here. - Really, they stayed? - They were executed. (somber music) - I'm sorry. - There are thousands like me. - I doubt that. - I don't know your mission, but perhaps when it is done, we'll meet again. - Possibly dinner. - Done, and a walk by the sea. - Bring it on. - Okay. (Pope and Natasha laughing) - Excuse me, I don't mean to interrupt you, but could you please tell me how much further it is? - 16 kilometers. - Thank you. - You know if you stop hating me for a minute, I might grow on you. - Like a tumor? - More like caviar. - Well, I hate fish. - Of course. (orchestral music) - Get me Yurdovich. (dramatic music) - You must change your clothes in the back. - Damn, that car's windy. - That's a Serbian convertible. - You guys don't take anything seriously, do you? (engine rumbling) - You want some binoculars? - Might come in handy. - How 'bout you, Marks? - Those government issue? - For you, restricted. - [Natasha] This is a safe house. - Looks like a haunted house to me. (eerie music) - The bunkers are here to be below the ground. This first tunnel here... A-dee-ta! (sobs) - She's dead. (clicking) - Dive! (gunshots booming) (explosion booming) (gunshots booming) (dramatic music) - [Delilah] Which way out of here? - [Natasha] This tunnel goes to the mountain. - [Pope] Let's go! (explosion booming) - I didn't think it'd be so dangerous for you. - It's okay, I'm with you now. - Okay, I'll catch up to you, okay? (suspenseful music) - Marks, back there? - [Delilah] You wait here. - [Pope] Marks? - Marks! Marks. (coughing) (orchestral music) - [Pope] Marks. Marks. (gunshots booming) Marks, can you hear me? Dammit! (suspenseful music) Look out, let's go. - Pope. - I wanna stay a few minutes and wait for Marks. - Marks is dead. Besides, we're running out of time. - Yeah. (orchestral music) Uh oh, trouble ahead. I'd like to start avoiding these altogether. - Agreed. Hold on! (dramatic music) (Delilah whooping and laughing) - Good drivin'! (suspenseful music) - I don't think they liked that trick too much. (gunshots booming) (soldiers clamoring) There's not much chance we can lose 'em on this straight road. - Maybe we don't have to. (explosion booming) (gunshots booming) - It didn't even seem to faze them. - Maybe these will. (orchestral music) (beeping) (explosion booming) - They're still comin'. - Ah, hell. (gunshot booming) - Damn! - Good one. - Thanks. - Hey, Natasha. Do you know anybody that can help us get to Yurdovich? - Maybe someone. (jazz music) (patrons speaking and laughing faintly) - I hope you don't plan on drinking too many of those tonight. - You're beginning to sound like my ex-wife. - The information you want is available, for a price. - Well, we're willing to pay your price, if you can guarantee that it's accurate. - It's guaranteed. - All right then, tell us. - Yurdovich's compound is located 100 kilometers from here. Near Dubrovnik. You can get there by car, but a car will be spotted 20 kilometers south. I suggest you walk. As for his weapons, it's near the compound. - Where? - Nearby. - That's not good enough, for what we're paying. - I can provide you with safe house there. The code: the sun is red. The reply will be, the moon is not. You'll meet an old man. He'll have the information you need. - He'd better. - It's guaranteed. - So your reputation didn't include an ex-wife. - That was a long time ago. I like to keep it that way. Just keep walkin'. - What? - Keep walkin'. Don't turn around. Keep movin'. (suspenseful music) There you go. (laser sizzles) (exclaiming) (dramatic music) (tires squealing) Don't stop for any fares. - You got it. (gunshot booming) (tires squealing) (gunshots booming) - [Stanson] I couldn't help noticing who you were after. - Do you know them? - It's guaranteed. - You know, I don't think we can trust Stanson's information. - Don't have a choice. There's only 48 hours until Yurdovich carries out his threat. - Stakes are high. - That's what makes the game exciting. - Uh oh, looks like we got us some company. (dramatic music) - Watch your eyes. (flashbulb pops) (tires squealing) (explosion booming) All right. Scored. - God, I hope those were the bad guys. - Me too. (birds twittering) (speaking faintly) (orchestral music) - Welcome to all my guests. Let us celebrate the new Serbia that tomorrow will bring. (orchestral music) (birds twittering) - [Pope] We better walk from here. - I thought you didn't like to walk. - I don't. (panting) - I see the safe house, 200 yards. Wanna have a look? (Delilah gasps) - Put me down! Let's go, I... - This way. (suspenseful music) Hello? (knocking at door) Anybody home? - [Delilah] Hello? - The sun is red? (guns click) - And the moon is not. (upbeat music) - [Dwarfman] Put that on. - Guess I'm not dressed appropriately. - Now. - Aren't you at least gonna be a gentleman and turn your back? Guess not. - [Yurdovich] Welcome, Mr. Pope, please have seat. - I'd rather stand. - You killed many of my men. You are impressive. - Pleasure was all mine. - And mine. - You are a very beautiful woman, Agent Shane. In the new Serbia, I think this will be the uniform for all women. - I guess you're not one for equal rights. - A woman has one right: to serve men. - I think I will sit down. (piano music) - Thank you. - '64, roo-sont. - Oh. - Very good year. - You are a man of fine taste. As am I. She is the youngest of my wives. I have 15. I believe in the ancient ways of kings. - Murder's a very interesting trade. - But, this is a war. And war is not murder. - So what are your intentions? - To create a new Serbian empire. How do you feel, Mr. Pope? - You um, drugged my wine. - Merely a precaution. - Son of a bitch. - I'd like to know about your enhancements, Mr. Pope. - What is he talking about? - Agent Shane! Please do not insult my intelligence. I'd sooner kill you than have that. You know what I'm talking about, don't you, Mr. Pope? Very well. Let me have you pay a visit to Dr. Chu. He has extraordinary methods for regaining memory. - [Chu] These rats have been starved for weeks. They will chew through anything when given the chance. (suspenseful music) You have 30 seconds. (chuckling) (rats squeak) Tell me about your enhancements, Agent Pope. - What is he talking about? - It's classified. All right, stop. I'll tell you. - Pope, don't tell him anything. - Don't you see it doesn't matter? He'll kill us anyway. - Tell me now, or I raise the gate. - The secret is, you're a dead man. (grunting) (Chu exclaiming) (Chu grunts) (squelching) (groaning) (suspenseful music) (rat squeaks) - Sorry, friend. Lunch's gonna have to wait. (orchestral music) - [Delilah] Pope! - Jump! Now! (Delilah gasps) Are you ready? - Always. (dramatic music) - Fire! (gunshots booming) - Surround the area. And bring him back. Alive. (orchestral music) - [Delilah] I can't run in this outfit. I have to rest. - [Pope] Come on, we don't have time. They're right behind us. Without weapons, we're sitting ducks. (Delilah panting) - I have to stop. - Okay. Okay? - You haven't even broken a sweat. Who are you, Superman? (chuckling) - No, not quite. - So where do you think Yurdovich will spray the chemicals? - Not around here. - Why do you say that? - This is Yurdovich's home, not a weapons depot. - Yeah, but what about Stanson's information? You think he was wrong? - Worse. - He tipped off Yurdovich. - Exactly. Sh. - I don't hear anything. - I do, come on. (dramatic music) - Pope, please, I have to catch my breath. - We don't have time to rest. Now I'm not leaving you, but I will carry you if I have to. - And here I was supposed to be the one protecting you. (dramatic music) (gunshots booming) (men groaning and yelling faintly) - [Natasha] Hi, you two okay? - What are you doing here? - I felt bad, so I followed you. Well, I've brought you some stuff. - Where is Agent Pope? - He escaped. - Where are the rest of your men? - Dead. - The threat he possesses might be much greater than we thought. - I doubt that. Don't worry about Pope, I'll handle him. - How? - While you're at the UN meeting with Cain, I'll track down Pope and find out if he's immune to the chemical. - I agree. Dwarfman and his men will be under your command. - What men is that? (birds twittering) - Welcome to the JSO, Mr. Ambassador. - Thank you; I've just received a bit of good news. - I could certainly use some. - Yurdovich has agreed to attend the negotiations. We'll convene the meeting here tomorrow. - That's excellent, sir; now it's just up to Pope. - The Pope? - No, sir, Agent Pope. (orchestral music) (waves lapping) - It's a good thing you knew about the paths through the valley. - They won't find us here. - Natasha, where does Yurdovich keep his chemicals? - I don't know, why are you asking me? - Stop playing games with me, right now. You set up a meeting with Stanson for us, when you knew where Yurdovich was all the time. Didn't you? - No. (ominous music) - She does know about those chemicals. - Yeah. (dramatic music) (gunshots booming) - Come on, let's get the hell outta here! (gunshots booming) (groaning) - Sorry, Natasha, there's just too much at stake. (orchestral music) (groaning) - This way. (Pope painting) All right, let's rest here. - [Pope] My pleasure. - How are you feeling? - Better. The pain's gone. - Lemme get some water and I'll wash that wound. All right, now let me know if I hurt you here, okay? Oh my God. - The wound has already closed, hasn't it? - How? - Can't tell you. - Yeah, but the bullet... - An X-ray would show it had already been dissolved by my body. - Who are you? - An agent, like you. - No, you're not like me, this is unreal. I know that it's our job to keep secrets, but I wish you trusted me. - I do. It's just sometimes it's better not to know things. - Okay, answer me one question. - Okay. - Are you human? - Very. (orchestral music) - Good. (insects chirring) (wolves howling) (orchestral music) Well, I just finished washing our clothes out. I was having a really hard time getting all the blood out of your shirt. - That's not surprising. I've been trying to get it off my hands for years. - So why did you become an agent? - Why'd you? - I don't know, I thought this would be an interesting career choice. - An interesting career choice. - Yeah, what about you? - I love the game. I live for it. - Is that all this is to you? Just a game? - Not right now. You cold? - Not right now. (orchestral music) (suspenseful music) - Still no word? - I'm afraid not, sir. - I shall inform the general consul that unless your man succeeds, we intend to accept their demands. - I have the utmost confidence in Agent Pope, sir. - Let's hope you're right. (suspenseful music) (birds twittering) - [Ted] Pope. - Marks? - [Ted] Do you read me, over. - Marks, is that you? - [Ted] Yes. (cattle lowing) (suspenseful music) - There he is. - You're not gonna believe what happened to me. I just went as fast as I could, the smoke was so thick I ran smack into a wall, head first, knocked me flat out. (laughing) - Ooh, that's bad. - What took you so long to find us? - You guys are hard to track. Where's Natasha? - Yurdovich's men gunned her down at the lake. - I can't believe that. I spoke to Cain; the UN's convening the emergency meeting. - Yurdovich gonna be there? - He's there, happenin' as we speak. - So then how much time do we have? - Cain said it's not gonna last much past dinnertime. - Shit. You know, we don't even know where the chemicals are. - Yes, we do. (choral music) Cain's confirmed that the chemicals are held in that church on top of the mountain. - So all we gotta do is get inside? - It's easier said than done. There are 30 armed men around that church. - That's 10 apiece. - Okay, let's get to it. (suspenseful music) - As the UN representative, I call this emergency meeting of the International Arbitration Committee to order. Commander Yurdovich will speak first. - The Serb Federation's position is clear. Our demands remain in force. Unless the West has something new to impart, we will carry out our plan as scheduled. - Commander Yurdovich, the UN General Consul has advised me to inform you that any aggressive action on the Serbian Federation part will be met by equal force by the UN. - Ambassador, I doubt that the UN is willing or capable of launching a chemical offensive against anyone. Therefore, Mr. Ambassador, I call your bluff. - We're here to negotiate, Commander, and that's what we're prepared to do. (dramatic music) - Well, looks like there's more than 10 apiece. - I like a good challenge. - You know, we can't all be super-agents like you, Pope. - You know, she's right. Lemme go up around the other side and see if we can get in from there. - Why don't we all go? - Let's not risk more of us than we have to. I'll just check it out, be right back. - Okay. - Okay. - I hope your man comes through. I don't know how much longer we can stall. - Well, we don't know the full extent of his chemical arsenal, do we, sir? - No. - Well, maybe we can beat Yurdovich at his own game. - What is that game? - Poker, sir. - I think, Commander, you'll find the caviar here excellent. - I have caviar every day, Mr. Cain. - I see you know me. - Of course, we're in the same line of business, aren't we? - I don't know about that, Commander. But what I do know, as we speak, the UN forces are in a position to defend against your chemical offensive. - I'm not so sure about that. - We are, sir. - Would you ever consider getting involved with somebody you work with? - Well, I guess that would depend on who that someone is. You know, this line of work doesn't really lend itself to a gentle heart. - Yeah, I used to think that. Not anymore. - I might consider your offer, under one condition. - What? - That we both get outta here alive. Deal? - Deal. (gunshots booming) Stay here. - Wait, I'm going with you. - No, it's okay. I want you here. (gunshots booming) - Hey, you fuckin' idiot, hold your fire. (gunshot booming) (suspenseful music) You talk to Yurdovich? - No. - Then the plan's the same. I get Pope into the church, expose him to the chemicals. I know how bad you want Pope. But under no circumstances are you gonna get him. He is mine. - What do we get? - Agent Shane, she'll tell you everything you need to know. - What are you gonna do with Pope? - I'm gonna kill him. - All right. (sighs) - What's wrong? - It's Marks. - Is he dead? - He's workin' for Yurdovich. - So what now? - We go along with the plan. - Ambassador, these negotiations are growing stale. If your tactic is to stall, it will do no good. You see, I know about your plan to destroy my weapons. But what Mr. Cain here doesn't know is that his man will not find my weapons. They are already deployed in the areas where they will be used. On my command, the weapons will be remotely activated. And, Ambassador, I'm getting closer to giving that command. - Commander, am I to understand that you're aware of the JSO's Agent Pope? - He and I have had the pleasure of meeting. - I've been authorized to disclose to you that Agent Pope has been involved in the JSO program known as Operation Phoenix. - Yes, Ambassador, I know all about Operation Phoenix. - Commander? Let me inform you of what you don't know about Operation Phoenix. There are 50,000 soldiers under the NATO command who are immune to your chemical. - The UN has authorized the offensive deployment of these companies, to force the unconditional surrender of all troops under your command, and all those who are part of your cause. Therefore, your chemical threat does not warrant the demands you make. (chuckling) - In that case, maybe I should give the command right now. - If you do, then the UN is in a position to retaliate with extreme prejudice. - There is one problem with your position, Ambassador. You don't know for sure whether Agent Pope or anyone else is immune to the chemical. Is that really a chance the UN is willing to take? - Okay, I found a way into the church that's harder for them to defend. - What is it? - The perimeter's only protected on this side. So if you go around the back side, you might be able to create a diversion that's gonna draw 'em off the church. Then we just slip in, and I figure we're gonna be safe 'cause they're not gonna wanna go near the chemical. What do you think? - Sounds easy. - It just might be. - What do you think? - Well, I think that I should stay here until the weapons are destroyed. Then I get back into town and inform Cain. - That's good. - I agree. - Let's split up, create two diversions. - No, I don't think so, I think we should stick together. - Why? - Well, 'cause you're our best man, they're gonna think they're being surrounded, they won't blow up the church. - Good thinkin'. (gunshots booming) - She's an agent, Pope, she'll be all right. Come on. - Hey! (gunshots booming) It's not nice to sneak up on a girl like that. - [Ambassador] You know, Cain, your bluff with the NATO forces may have worked for the time being. But how much longer do you think we can stall? - [Cain] As long as it takes. - What are you talking about? Yurdovich is a loose cannon. He'll release the gas, even if unprovoked. (chuckling) - That's what he wants you to think, Ambassador. Yurdovich is here to bargain. He's not gonna give up his only chip. - So what do you recommend we do next? - We wait. - [Ambassador] Wait, for what? - Same thing Yurdovich is waiting for. If Pope is immune to the chemical, we win. - And if he's not? - Then you pack your bags and go home. (choral music) - Okay, once we set off the explosives, most of the soldiers gonna go and check it out. Whoever's left, we're gonna have to handle. - Then we'll blow up the church. - We can't blow up the church. The chemicals'll spread through the whole region and kill everybody. No, you've gotta go into the church and disarm the weapons. That'll give Cain the time he needs. - You comin' with me? - My job was to bring you here. If the chemicals leak, chances are, it's not gonna harm you, but it's gonna kill me. - Okay, let's do it. (explosion booming) (somber music) (explosion booming) - Good luck, Pope. (dramatic music) - [Dwarfman] Go go go, go go go! - Just as I thought. Now we don't have to deal with as many. - Yeah, that's right. After you. (laser sizzles) (groaning) - Say cheese! (flashbulb pops) (yelling) (gunshots booming) - He's gonna get us both, go on! Watch out. Pope, get in the church; go on, go! (groaning) (dramatic music) (yelling) I could have handled that guy. - No, you couldn't; let's go. (orchestral music) - [Ted] We made it. Hey, Pope. - Yeah? - Good luck, man. - Thanks. (somber music) Shit. - What? - Door's locked. - The door can't be locked. - Yeah, it is; you wanna try it? - Get inside the church, Pope. - What a surprise; you're the mole. - That's right. - Money? - Yeah, a lot of it. You know, the chemicals aren't even in the church. And the command center's in town. - So why do you want me to go inside? - 'Cause I left a few chemicals just for you. Just to see exactly how enhanced you really are. - I guess this means we're not gonna be friends anymore. - Always the funny man, aren't you, Pope? Get in the fuckin' church. - Okay. (suspenseful music) (clicking) (somber music) - He's dead, let's go! - I have an announcement to make, gentlemen. Apparently someone had a little trouble with gas. Agent Pope is dead. (door bangs) (dramatic music) (somber music) - The UN has reconsidered, and is prepared to accept some of your demands. - I'm sorry, Ambassador. That will not be acceptable. The terms have now changed, and this meeting is over. (dramatic music) - Commander Yurdovich, (speaking in foreign language) Yes. - What are the orders? - We wait. (Pope sighs) (orchestral music) (suspenseful music) (gunshots booming) (gun clatters) (suspenseful music) - I guess this is where I get off. - Who we got here? You're one tough lady, aren't you? - You're one slime-bag piece of shit. - Insults excite me. (Delilah cries out) (spits) She's yours, Dwarfman. (explosion booming) (speaking in foreign language) (gunshots booming) After him! (dramatic music) (gunshots booming) (groaning) (suspenseful music) Dwarfman. (orchestral music) (clattering) - You wouldn't shoot an unarmed man, would you? - Sure I would. But I don't have to. (clattering) (suspenseful music) (grunting) (bones snapping) (somber music) (dramatic music) (Delilah cries out) - Set 'em off! - [Pope] Marks! - Don't try me. - Let her go. - I'll blow her head off. - Do it, Pope! - You got it, baby. (crackling) (groaning) (explosion booming) You okay? - You just kill that bastard. - You stay here. (suspenseful music) (grunting) I'm with ya! Friend! (grunting) - Pope! (yelling) (thudding) (somber music) - Congratulations, you accomplished your mission. - But what about Yurdovich? - As it were, Yurdovich wasn't much of a threat. He only had a small amount of gas, and that was stolen from a lab in Germany. - What? - You mean the whole mission was to sniff out a mole? - But what about the command post? - That was to fool Marks. You see, Yurdovich wasn't quite sure he could trust him. Turns out, he could. - You're leavin' something out, Cain, what is it? - Unfortunately, it was our scientists who developed the gas. It was the most lethal threat to mankind since the atomic bomb. We had to find out if our antidote worked. You were the guinea pig. - Guinea pig. - That's the game, Pope. Delilah, don't unpack; your next mission is in Damascus, and you're going to Zaire. - No, no no, game's over. - The game is never over. What else is there that you can do? - I'm checkin' out Damascus. (orchestral music) (slow orchestral music)
