My name is Tiger. I am a third grader. In my home there's only my morn and me. Last Christmas, I remember it was very, very hot- I was given the Stone of Courage, and I saw an UFO. I also did something amazing. You know what I did? I turned my morn into a robot. To save her life, I turned off all the power in the whole world. Mr. Tie, Where are we going? We're going to check on your morn. You're back from school. Your dinner is ready. You're going away on a business trip again, Dad? Yes. I'm going to Mars for seven months. Dad, I want to go with you. I want to go with you. Be a good boy, Harry. I bought a Mother Android 2 for you. It will be delivered soon. What is a Mother Android 2? It's the newly launched mother robot. It will take care of you every day. You'll love it. Wow! Is there a little Harry here? Wow! Here you go, little Harry. Your package. Bye. Hi Welcome to your mother. Mother Android 2. I am Dr. Three Strands. Please hold your android tight for ten seconds. To activate it. Its second-generation DNA system software allows it to respond to a child's hug. It will love you, take care of you and spend time with you like your own mother, but without the nagging. All the better! Thank you very much. Turbo cleaning function on. Everyone calls me Tiger, but I gave myself a secret name back then: The Lone King He was a very special knight in that. He didn't have to protect the Earth, his sole mission was to keep himself company. The lonelier I got, the more powerful he grew. In all those years, if loneliness were my demon to fight then my mother's would be all the bills she couldn't pay Listen, I'm about to get married. Can we cut down on Tiger's living expenses? You haven't paid his living expenses in six months. Cutting down? We're still friends, aren't we? How long has it been since you last visited him? But... you know how busy... I have been. The bill, please. Here's your bill. I'm paying for my coffee only. No problem. Keep the change. Thank you. Wait, wait. You're leaving? But we're not done talking... I have a perfect home, It's clean, beautiful and comfy; My siblings are fun to play with, Miss Yang, someone's here to see you Good day, Miss Yang. Have you noticed anything different about Tiger lately? Miss Yang, Something wrong with Tiger? Well, in our art class, I had all the kids draw their mother. Everyone drew their mother's face except for Tiger. He drew the back of you. The back of me? He drew with dark colors. And irregulars lines. Tiger told me You often have your back to him at home, So that's what he remembers about you. Perhaps that's what's affecting him. One more thing. Tiger has a hard time concentrating in class. He's always fidgeting and he'd quarrel with other kids. I know how stressful it can be being a mother, But I have to remind you, Tiger has not paid his lunch fee in a few months. We'll need you to take care of it at your earliest convenience. This is how a Mother Android 2 charges its power. It will charge itself from now on. OK and when it's done charging, it will stop on its own. OK Mr. Ha, the car to Mars is ready. You'd better hop on bye bye Harry's father is heading to Mars to work, while Harry and Mother Android 2 stay home and begin their new life together. Don't miss out on all the exciting adventures tomorrow, right here on "Saving Mother Robot." Mommy, sign here. Wow, you got a 92? That's total 92 for math, English and Mandarin. Only 92 with all three courses combined? Cat only got 60 for all three courses. I'm ten thousand times better than him. You missed the payment again, Morn. You are the only morn who hasn't paid. Time for bed. Go brush your teeth. Now! Mommy is a big idiot! I want to throw her into outer space. I wished my morn was like a Mother Android 2. Then she would only play with me and not nag. Sorry, sorry. Let me pass. I'm in big trouble Sorry! I'm running late Give it back! You're stepping on my magazine. I'm the chief editor of this magazine. Mr. CEO, here's the print sample you requested. Human Resources tells me you're late every day. Mr. CEO... Editorial tells me you turned in your assignment finally but it was only halfway done. I'm sorry, that's because... yesterday... Then Sales Dept. says you have been taking side jobs to make more money. Miss Cao Yi, Miss Cao Yi, what on earth are you up to? You want to lose your job? No. I'm very sorry. Sorry, it won't happen again. You've said this many times yet. It keeps on happening. And now you're sitting yourself down. Just what do you think you're doing? Pardon me, Mr. CEO. A Mr. Tie is here to see you. This way, please. Mr. Tie! Daniel has told me about you. How do you do? Get a glass of water for him. Right away. Have a seat. I have a letter for you from Daniel. My dear Daniel. How's he doing in London? Time flies, you know. Can't believe it's been ten years already. He's doing well. Recently promoted to be the Editor-in-Chief That's great. You know what? Daniel and I used to daydream together when we were kids in Hong Kong. It's wonderful that we're hooked up again because of you. So you're here to document some big birds? Yes. The geography magazine is doing a special issue on With the ecosystem all messed up right now, we are seeing the Red Kites where they shouldn't be. We would like to document this. Good Idea! We will assist you in all ways we can. You're new in town. If you need anything, just ask Cao Yi! Cao Yi! Go with Mr. Tie and help him in whatever he needs for the shooting. You're now his assistant, got it? it? Yes. Don't just say yes. Take down his number. Oh, right. Mr. Tie, may I have your phone number, please. 0932-722... And your email? Why don't I write it down for you. By the way. Do you have a place to stay? I have a cottage by the ocean. Very nice one. Hey, hey To document these birds you need to dress in natural color. Otherwise you could scare it away Mr. Tie, would you mind giving me a heads up about what I'm required to do? To tell you the truth I'm no expert in anything other than protecting chicks like a hen. Could you go lie down there and pretend to be a dead hen. What? What for? To lure the Red Kites Are you nuts?! Just kidding It's not funny The Red Kites are a very special animal. They clean up for nature. They make a feast out of dead animals, dead fish, rotten meat... They are like mothers, then. They eat leftovers Are you OK? You like that thing, too? My aunt gave it to me when I was little. I carry it with me everywhere. Can I see it? Sure. My son has one exactly the same. Maybe you're my son's father... No no, I mean, maybe your toy is the father of my son's toy Hey, honey“. Mommy is still working. Listen, I will be home before dark, OK? If you're good today, I will give you a piece of chocolate after I get home. When I came down to work the field this morning, I was like, What the fuck?! What happened to my field? How much land have you lost? Well, I lost half of my entire lot. You know... Look at this... Look at this... Look at this... Will you be applying for subsidies from the the Farmer's Association. Yes. Yes. I will definitely apply for subsidies from the Farmer's Association. However, in order to apply for it I'm at a rice field near Dadu Road. The radiation level here is as high as 40uSv over the entire field, some unknown object must have flown past here last night. Could there be a new message from above? I remember when I was a boy, one day... I sat under a tree thinking about my mother, who had just passed away. And I saw an UFO when I looked up into the sky. My aunt told me then, that the UFO had come to get my mother, that many of our loved ones live up there in heaven after leaving us. Perhaps I have been searching my other self all this time. After that day, I never saw a UFO again. It's as though the world in a child's eye is entirely different from that in an adult's. I can't believe. My boss is asking me to be the assistant to a UFO maniac on top of working on a photo magazine full of shirtless men. That chest is a top-quality pillow. Suits you just fine. It's about time you got sexed up. All this work is about to bury me alive. C'est la vie, my friend. We're all in the same boat. Look at me, a shop owner, so what? By the way. Did that asshole ex-husband of yours pay his alimony? He's gonna cut it down by half, says his company isn't doing so well. Cut it down by half? That's terrible! Can't believe you haven't told me this. Am I not like a sister to you? Here's what we're gonna do. Why don't you come over to work in my shop on the weekend. And I'll Pa)' YOU- This will help you with your finances a bit. You can do your art design work here while tending the shop. OK, it's a deal. Just come over in the evenings. My nephew Curly will be here as well. Fangfang, I love you. I love you, too! Thank you for watching Life Weather Forecast. Due to global warming, winter this year has been as hot as summer. Tomorrow's temperature will remain 33 degrees all daylong. All schools have made the announcement to have their students switch to summer uniform. To prevent heat strokes, do remember to dress lightly this winter. I'm out playing soccer with the kids. Cat and I are best friends, but I have no clue what he's talking about most of the time Look, my mom's bought me all these toys. Here's the car that runs faster than a Ferrari. And this is a magical belt. You're so lucky. My morn never buys me any toys. Good thing my cousin gave me a "girlfriend." Hi Betty. No, her name is Orchid now. She was Betty when she used to my cousin's, now that she's mine, I call her Orchid. Let's go home, kids. I thought you were going to play soccer with us? Curly thinks he's a super stud. I think he is rather funny. Who did that? Who did that? Come out now! You wanna hide? Fine. The ball is mine! That's it, then, OK. Bye. Little... Kids... Kids... Meat...? ...Bun. The shop owner is called Mr. Human Meat. He used to work as an engineer in the electricity company. What is an electricity company? We all use electricity at home, don't we? Mr. Human Meat was the one making sure we got the electricity we needed from the company he worked for. Listen, you two better stay away from the man, you hear? Why? Because he hated kids ever since he got nutty and was dragged into a mental hospital. He opened up a shop like this so he could grab all the kids from the street, kill them, and turn them into meat buns. Kids like you, Cat, are his favorite. You'd better hang a few talismen over your neck. Why? Why? Look at yourself, all this fatty meat. Best for making juicy buns! Tiger! Let's go. Hi, Mr. Tie. Miss Cao? I am now looking for that herbal tea shop, but I have no idea where it's located. What street are you on right now? You think I'd call you if I knew that? I've already sent you his video clip. Have you seen it? I...|. I am watching it right now. So this is the UFO you were talking about. Oh, I know! That herbal tea shop is on Dihua Street! Hello there. Are you Monsieur Bear Hat Lin? Lin? Hat... Bear? Hat“ Bear? Yes, I am. Tell me, Monsieur Lin, did you shoot this video? Yes. I certainly shot that video. Jincumi! How very interesting! No one believed what I had to say about this thing, you're the only one coming around asking. Jincumi! Jincumi? Jincumi! I get it. Having talked to Monsieur Bear Hat Lin today, I now know where the UFO has made its appearance: a placed called "Jincumi!" No, no. You got it all wrong. This was shot in the Chiun (Elephant) Mountain of the Four-Animal Mountains. Chiun? What mountain? The Chiun Mountain! The four animals are ho, pao, sai, chiun (tiger, leopard, lion, elephant) Ho (tiger), pao (leopard), sai (lion), chiu (elephant). They make up the Four-Animal Mountains. Ho, pao,, sai, chiu. Ho, pao, sai, chiun? What do they mean? Oh, forget it. What a waste of time and energy to talk to you. You don't get a thing I say and you're not here to buy anything. You don't want to talk to me? But I want to talk to you! Hello Lady Cao, just exactly when do you plan on coming over? Where do you want me to go? The herbal tea shop of course. You drew me a map a moment ago, remember? Mr. Tie, I had no idea you needed me there. From now on, would you please tell me directly what you have in mind for me to do? OK. Can you please come over here right now? But I can't. I'm tending the shop... Then why waste my time talking so much? Mr. Tie... Mr. Tie... Mr. Tie Mr. Tie Mr. Tie This is urgent! Please listen to me! This is urgent! Please listen to me! This is urgent! Why didn't you answer my calls? I just went over to the herbal tea shop, but I didn't see you There's nothing for us to talk about. You didn't want to help. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. Please forgive me and give me one more chance to work very hard for you. You call this... "Asking no one for help?" I know I'm hardly the best, but I promise to work extra hard. I cannot afford to lose this job. I am the only one supporting my family. I have to earn money to bring up my kid. I have to pay for the food, the mortgage, the toys and the cram school, all by myself. You're a single morn? Is... ls there a problem with me being a single morn? Would that keep you from finding your aliens? No, not really. Then“. Fine. I'll see you at the herbal tea shop, same time tomorrow Thank you. That's the toilet. Thank you. Tiger, how come you didn't do your homework? The teachers at cram school help you do your homework? I'm talking to you. Hi Tiger. Can you tell me a little about your drawing? This is the Lone Knight. He's the strongest knight of all. He is very strong because he's always alone. Why is he strong because he's alone? Because the Lone Knight only has a mommy and no daddy. His mommy is always working and has no time to be with him, so he sleeps alone, he eats alone, and he plays alone. His mommy goes to work until very late, and so he never gets a hug from her before going to sleep. OK, everyone, don't forget to place your card in the sock after writing down your wish, and wait for Santa Claus to show up. Now, remember, write down your wish but don't say it out loud, or it will never come true. Oh, and one more thing, for our next class, please bring a live insect. I will be teaching you how to draw insects. Class dismissed. Thank you, Miss Yang. Santa Claus Christmas is the holiday to make wishes. This year I wish for my mommy to turn into a Mother Android 2 for real. She will do as I say, and spend lots of time with me playing my toys. Thank you for watching today's weather forecast. Let's take a look at tomorrow's weather. As you all know, tomorrow is Christmas Eve, but it will be an unusually hot day. Oh, I'm feeling over-heated right now... My skin, my fair skin is getting all tanned, you see. It is 38 degrees Celsius, Ah... that is just outrageous! God, hey. let me ask you, God, why are you giving us such a hot day? It's so hot I'm about to pass out! I've forgotten to send you your Christmas present, and it so happens that the courier services here on Mars are now on strike. So I thought of a way to solve the problem. I will have Mother Android 2 fly over to get it. It can fly? Yes. The 2nd generation comes with the flying function. It will take about 12 hours for it to fly to Mars. So 24 hours for the round trip. Doesn't it need to sleep? For you it doesn't. But when used over 24 hours, its chip will have a fever. What do we do, then? Just let it rest a while, so it won't break down. I see. Ouch! Here you are, Mother Android 2. Here's the present for Harry. Much obliged. Merry... Christmas... Ha.. rry... It's a kite from Mars! It looks like Harry's robot mother is about to break down. Tomorrow, tune in to "Saving Mother Robot" to find out what will happen to Harry. Mommy, Mommy, wait What, honey? My assignment My teacher says we have to bring an insect to class tomorrow. What? Insect? Why didn't you tell me earlier? I did tell you. But you forgot. Alright. I promise to get you an insect after work, OK? Even if you don't get to sleep. Yes, even if I don't get to sleep. Bye now. Be good. Deal It seems as though my wish is starting to come true. The planets lining up in a row; what are the chances of someone witnessing such a thing, It's my lucky streak, I tell ya, having witnessed what I did. I guess I am a late bloomer. "He says..." HO... Mr. Lin says the UFO he saw was in the shape of a banana boat. He says he isn't bluffing, and that the whole thing wasn't just a blind coincidence meaning that good luck is finally on the side of a late bloomer like him. The UFO that Monsieur Bear Hat Lin saw was in the shape of a banana, meaning it's the boomerang type, which had appeared once in Turkey. According to the UFO Association, what happened to Monsieur Lin would be classified as Contact of the Third Kind. Tell us more... It took me everything I've got to shoot that video. It took him everything he's got to shoot that video. The banana boat was flying so fast, shiu-shiu-shiu, like that. So if you weren't good with the camera you couldn't possibly get an image He said, it's not easy filming that UFO because it was moving so fast. If you weren't good with the camera you couldn't do it. The banana boat wasn't moving in a straight line. It was going shiu-shiu-shiu, and shima-shima-shima. Excuse me. Shiu-shiu-shiu? Yes. Shiu-shiu-shiu, shima-shima-shima No, he was saying... Oh, please. A monkey will be a monkey even if it's dressed in a suit Let me tell you, this guy here is Mr. Bluffing Magician. He's an expert in turning nothing into something. Stop with all that nonsense right now What a joke! You're the one talking nonsense! Why don't you take a rest, and I will inform them of everything they need to know. About that green dragon in the sky, the way it appeared that day was like this... For Christ sake! They are my customers I did a reading that day and something unusual came up. Turns out it was spot-on accurate! On that day Lin and I went to the Elephant Mountain, Actually I was the one who caught the footage. But no worries, young man, you still have a chance. The first day of the last month of the lunar calendar is that comes around once every 60 years. Something magical will appear in the sky that day. Don't miss it if you like this sort of thing. She says that last night she got a very unusual reading which says on the first day of the last month of the lunar calendar if we look to the northeastern sky, something magical will appear She says to look out for it if you're interested. I am definitely interested. Master, thank you for describing it in such detail. I make no mistakes in telling someone' fortune. I like your good looks, so I'd really like to reveal certain things to you. Looking at this face of yours, I see that you are closer to your aunt than your parents. Be good to this aunt of yours, she helps you heaps throughout your life... What did she say? She says she's spot-on when it comes to fortune-telling, and she wants to tell you a few things because she likes She feels that you are closer to your aunt than to your parents, and that this aunt of yours helps you a lot in your life so you must treat her well. Let's go say goodbye to your mom. How come my morn went to heaven after only a few days in hospital. Because“. Your morn was taken away by a UFO. Really? You don't believe me? Then look at the sky Many of our loved ones live up there. It's where we have all come from. When our time is up, someone will send a UFO, to take us home. Aunty, I don't want you to go on, silly. Am I not sitting right next to you? Here, one for you and one for me. Have a lollipop when you miss your morn, then look at the sky. When you taste the sweetness in your mouth, it's your morn smiling at you. You'll have to smile back. Oh no, it's 11 already! What should I do? All the shops must be closed. What shops? I have to get my son a live insect. I believe there's a pet shop near my place. We need to go. Thank you. Sure thing. Come again. Bye Oh no... It's closed! Let me call the shop owner. Cockroach. Cockroach will do. Please... I beg you. Mommy? I forgot to bring my earthworm. Could you bring it to school for me? I've told you I can never deliver anything to school for you because I'm a shop owner and I've got business to tend to. If you get in trouble, it's your own fault. Your mom is so nice. My morn wouldn't bring it for me I have a feeling my morn is turning into a Mother Android 2. Why is that? Because I made a wish. What wish? Can't tell you. Otherwise the wish won't come true. Tiger! Aghhhhhh... Mommy The cockroach... It got away The cockroach got away... Go catch it! Come back here, cockroach! Come back! Darn... I'm such a lousy mother. I was just trying to deliver the insect to school for Tiger and I nearly screwed it up. Go away... Away YOU 99- Hey. What're you doing?! The devil has taken possession of your brain. I'm chasing it off. Hey! There's something wrong with my eyes. Some black things are flying in front of them. I did it! My sorcery ritual done. Miss Fangfang! Are you listening to me? My vision has been unclear these days and my back aches like hell. Sometimes my entire arm feels numb, from finger to shoulder. That's because you've been on the computer too much! You think I want to? I'm working on your catalogue here. Here you go. Dr. Xie. He's a great ophthalmologist. Call him up. Here. These are good for your brain and eyes. And these- they will ease all your pain. OK Thank you very much, Aladdin. Your sure know how to turn tricks. Miss, look after yourself, will you? Cheer up a bit! Look, that's your son over there. What's he gonna do if you fell ill? Sometimes I think mothers are not human beings, we are robots. There's a million things to take care of every day, when do we ever get time for ourselves? No no, speak for yourself. But then, if I were a robot, I would be the most beautiful one. O-KEY You're the most beautiful one. Happy? And I'm the one who's ugly and gets picked on like a cockroach. But you know what? I'm an unbeatable cockroach! That's right! That's the spirit! OK. Now let's shout it out. No, no... Come on. "A woman is her own salvation!" No. I'm dead tired C'mon. C'mon. Do it. Ready? Go. "A woman is her own salvation!" When you wake up every morning, shout it three times. Stop with that, let's do it again... C'mon C'mon "A woman is her own salvation!" Tiger Cat, I have two scary things to tell you. What are they? Mr. Human Meat has captured a kid. I saw him. Oh no! The kid will turn into a meat bun. What's the second thing? The second thing is, I saw my morn charging her power, just like on TV. Hi, Mr. Tie. I think you are early Sorry. I'm used to being early. But... I was just getting my son out of the shower... So... Wait... I didn't meant to... Would you please come in and wait for me? Mommy, wipe my hair for me OK, OK. Come over here. Mommy is late so we need to hurry. Can you do it yourself? You do it then. I have to go change now. OK? This is Mr. Tie. Be polite, OK? OK. Make yourself at home. This is for you. My mom says I can't eat that. I'll put it away if you don't want it I want it! Do you want it or not? This guy is a bit strange. He can move his nose, and ears. He tells me, I am not from planet earth Is he from outer space? He must be a very cool alien. I want to show him my secret base. You're the very first visitor. Your mom's never come in? No. She'll love this place, I guarantee it. My mom says you're looking for UFOs. Have you seen them? I have, when I was a kid, but never again after that. But I believe I will see them again one day. Why? Because believing in something is power. It will make things happen Do aliens live up there in the sky? Not only aliens. The Jade Emperor, the Money God and Santa Claus all live up there. I thought Santa Claus lives in the Headquarter. I've been to the Headquarter and met Santa Claus in person. I even took pictures. I hope the Headquarter will remember my home this year. Could you remind them? last year, Santa Claus forgot about me. This is my number. From now on, if you have any messages for Santa Claus, just give them to me, and I'll pass them along to him. Don't forget, OK? Pass me a new memory card, please. Thank you. Where is it? I don't see it. Here, I'll get it. If you don't feel well, just go home and get some rest. I don't get paid for taking time off. I'm fine. Don't worry. I won't tell Mr. CEO. I'm fine, really. Why do you believe in living beings from the outer space? Why not? The world is huge, with so many things unknown to us. I saw it with my own eyes when I was little. You sure? Yes, I'm sure. Tie, I don't think you should waste so much time on these impractical things. You should do fashion photography and build up your contacts. That way you'll make more money. Certain things in life just can't be measured by money. When you come back to reality, you'll know how important money is. What's reality? It's different for everyone. In my eyes, this is reality. The world does not revolve around you. I'm so thirsty. I want some water. I have some here. Drink it if you want. No. I don't want to give you my cold. I'll go buy some. Ouch. Are you alright? Is the rock OK? That's not funny. It hurts. Ouch. Are you alright? I think I sprang my ankle. Easy, easy. Don't press hard on this leg. I don't see any cars. Hey, there's a car coming What happened? Could you please give us a ride? She injured her foot. Could you please? Alright. Get on. Does it hurt right here? How about here? You'll feel better with it propped higher Sir. You got any ice? I see a fridge back here. I don't have much in there. Should be enough, thanks. Hang on, it's gonna hurt. Ouch You know... Once upon a time, there was a guy by the name of Match. One day as he was walking down the street, he scratched his head. He scratched and scratched, and his head burst into flames. Oh god. That's a bad joke. And then there was this guy called Pizza. He walked down the street one day and walked straight into a brick oven. Even my son tells better jokes than you do. Is that right? Is your son's name Pizza? I'll have my son tell you a joke next time. Hello. Hello. Hello. I just mailed you the audio file of the master's prediction. Please check for me to make sure the time and place are correct. OK'? Are you alright? Mommy, your forehead feels hot. Don't worry, I'm fine. I've been having a lot of nightmares lately Having nightmares, are you? Oh, poor thing. Let me give you kisses and you'll feel better What is it? Sun up? Mommy, how come your computer can speak? Because there's a man in there with whom I work. Have you forgotten Mr. Tie? Say hello. Hello, Mr. Tie Yes... I can speak. I'll go check on it. Wait here. Hello, Alien. I am a robot No, you're not Then what is this? My Lone Knight is just like yours. Mine has many functions, including burping and farting. Tiger. Are you being naughty again? Time to go to bed. Mommy has more work to do. Good boy. Sorry about that, Mr. Tie. I just checked, the date and time in the Western calendar would be December 24th between the hours 7 to 9pm. Location wise, like what the master had said before, the Elephant Mountain fits the direction given by the reading. You are a lefty, too? Yes, I know you're left-handed as well. Living in the world of the righties, we lefties, can get very lonely. How do you do, I am Mr. Lefty. Hello there, Mr. Lefty Ready“. FUD... I'm the Flying Knight! She's all smoked up! Someone come and help! It's too late. The market will be closed soon Get that postman to help us Mr. Postman, look! That kid over there is being very naughty. He's about to break his mother Hey there, watch out. There's something wrong with your mother In the cartoon, Mother Android 2 broke down Will my android-like mommy also break down? Let's take a look at the satellite images here. The thick clouds hovering seem to portend thunder storms all around. I can't hang on anymore. Everyone of you out there, when you go out, be sure to put on your raincoat and bring an umbrella. Make sure you're prepared for this weather. Oh my» what are we going to do with such a big thunder storm? Tiger. Oh no! I burnt a hole on your pants! I fell asleep. I'm so sorry That's OK. I don't like them anyways. I'm sorry. Mommy's too tired That's OK. All I did was make a wish. How come my mommy is breaking down like Mother Android 2? I'm so hungry. Oh dear, it's so hot! When over used, the IC chips of Mother Android 2 will break down due to overheating. When this happens, please go to the bathroom, turn on the hot water, then shout into the mirror three times. Come in, Headquarter. Come in, Headquarter. Come in, Headquarter. How may I help you? Dr. Three Strands! Losing more strands by the day. My mommy is breaking down! You've overused your mother, haven't you? The only way to fix her would be to have her stop being a mother. But honestly, I don't have a clue how to stop her from being a mother. Very sorry. Look! This is my spinning top. These are my toys, you can have them all! Please help me. Pretty please! Pretty please! Alright. Alright. Since you're such a good boy, I will tell you a secret trick. No one has ever used it before. Probably, it would work. Now listen carefully: Go find the box substation for your house and turn off all the power from there. This way your mother will be forced to shut down after she's run out of power and cannot recharge. This is the quickest way to re-boot her. Mr. Human Meat... What's wrong? How can you be depressed at your age? You depressed? No. My mom is sick It's all your fault. Look at the nice clothes you're wearing. You get good toys and eat good food, spending all of your mother's money. No wonder she is sick. And me? I don't even have the money to buy soy sauce chicken! You little brat. You're killing your mother! I didn't know it would turn out like this. All I did was make a wish. Hey. look! I won the online auction for this Stone of Courage at a high price. I used it to help me woo a hot chick, and it worked like charm. YES! So now I'm going to pass it down to you. Once you get the Stone of Courage. It will give you courage and hope. And with that, you will succeed like I did. You want some buns? I... was just leaving. Wait. Why have you come if you want no buns? I want to know where the box substation is. Why do you want to know? Either you tell me why or you do something for me, otherwise I won't help you. I'll do something for you. If you eat this bun I made, I will tell you where it is Sir, I want five crispy bowls Not only was the kid I had seen not killed, he came cheerily to buy five crispy bowls from the man. I discovered that Mr. Human Meat wasn't scary like Curly had told us. After I finished eating the bun, Mr. Human Meat was quite happy, he finally told me where the box substation for my home was. Please hand this to the Headquarter for me. No problem. I go there quite often these days. Because of this wish, I must go some place tomorrow. Where are you going? I can't tell you. So... What is your wish, then? My wish won't come true if I say it out loud How about this? You draw down your wish to show me. This way your wish will still come true. It Will? Of course. Things are very busy at the Headquarter these days, the more details you can give me, the better I can help to remind them. But you can't tell my morn. Deal Deal In order to save Mommy, I changed my wish and asked Mr. Tie to send it to the Headquarter. Dear Santa, please help me. I am about to embark on the mission to rescue my morn. And this... will save your life, when you're in need. Off you go.- Thank you so much You're very welcome According to Mr. Human Meat, first stop: Da'an Medical School Round 1 At the school entrance there's a crazy policeman, he bites like a mad dog. I must watch out for him. Push harder back there, will you? Stop. What's your business here? We're hereto deliver these stage boards for the fair Is that so? I don't care who you are. Do you know who I am? I am Security Guard Cai. No one goes into this campus without telling me, understand? Show me your IDs. Quick! Time is money, understand? There. Make no mistake about this: with me here, it is simply impossible for anyone to try and slip in. Simply impossible. The fair is that way! Business coming! May I help you? Miss Virgin Mary and Goddess Guanyin are wearing the same dress. Did they buy them in the same department store? Oh, whatever. Wait, wait. Hello? Hello? Aha! Intruder on site. Think you can outsmart me? You're so busted! Tie, I've got everything ready for your shoot. The batteries are all charged. Right here. Thanks. What happened to your eyes? No biggie. Some eye drops will do. Who sent you all these lollipops? Watch out for cavities, big boy. My aunt... sent them to me. She knows I love these. Your aunt? You seem very close. I lost my morn was I was little, so I was practically raised by my aunt. To me, she's like a mother and a big sister. When you said you're a single mother, it reminded me of her. She's also without a partner. Actually, your profile look a lot like hers. Your neck and this side of your face especially. You both exude this certain beauty of tenderness. Having photographed so many beautiful women, I've discovered, those who forget about their own beauty are the ones truly beautiful. And most mothers fall into this category. I didn't even know my neck is beautiful. Wrong. I am 75 years old. Wow... My shiny hair is real, so is my tight skin Wow... And I'm as virile as ever Wow... Now's the time you witness miracles. Round 2 Mister, welcome to our energy meeting. This way, please Have you seen a little kid around here? Come and witness the power of the Energy. This way I'm looking for someone... Stop right there! Don't run! Thank you. You get 10% off if you buy ten of them This is the wish list from Tiger. I'm told you forgot about him last year. Please don't do it again. I do usually get him presents. He's a bit naive, still believes that the presents are from Santa. I got too busy last year so I forgot. I wonder what toy he wants for Christmas this year? Toy? Dear Santa, I have changed my wish. I hope you will turn off my mom, so she can get some rest. I would be very sad if she broke down. Mom, I love you. Oh dear, why would he write such a thing? Feeling a bit bitter sweet I'm guessing? Here's a lollipop for that. Have one and all problems solved. That's not funny. Have you visited Tiger's secret base? You should. He loves you very much, that's why he's worried about you. Believe it or not, Kids see through all this mess we adults create after all. The character for the word busy is made up by the radicals of 'heart' and 'death.' So when too many things pile up in the heart, it dies. When that happens, the word busy becomes the word blind (same pronunciation in Mandarin). Your vision turns blurry. You know why I carry this pair of scissors everywhere? To remind myself to take on only what I can handle. When problems arise, try and solve them. And if they can't be solved, cut them off. Here. My present to you. Tie, I can't see clearly. Wait, I can't see... I can't see! What's wrong? I don't know. I can't see anything! I can't see! Round 3 Mr. Human Meat told me, once I reach the second floor, I'll see a storage room. I'll see a window. When I walk up to the window, I'll find the box substation right next to it. I believe you might have experienced seeing black floating dots that appear to fly around like mosquitoes? And your vision becoming blurry with objects going out of their normal shape? I thought it was because I had been on the computer too long and my eyes weren't getting enough rest. You should've brought your wife in earlier. The retina of her left eye is about to come off. It seems that you don't care about her very much. You need to get ready for surgery. Now. Doctor, I use my eyes a lot for my work, Please help me! I can't afford to lose them! You will be fine. You were pretty blind to begin with, can't go any "blinder." No such good luck for you. That's not funny. Mr. Tie Hello? Tiger? Are you back home? Where are you? I'm in the hospital with your mother right now. Tiger? Aghhhn. What the heck. Stop hiding. Come out now! You naughty b0)'- Come out, you! Come out! Hello? You can't hide from me! Tiger could be in danger. I have to go find him. Round 4 Goddess Guanyin? Virgin Mary? According to Tiger's map, I should head off in the direction of Guanyin. Tiger... Tiger... Tiger... Tiger... Final Round. Good thing I have a secret weapon. Oh no... there's another dog! YES! Mr. Tie, the key broke. The door is open Here comes my super-duper secret weapon Hello, little lamb, here comes the big wolf. What the?... What's going on? It's so sticky... K. O! Yes! We did it! I missed my chance to see the UFO, but instead I helped a kid fulfill his wish. That makes everything else seem less important. Mr. Tie, where are we going? We're going to check on your morn. Mommy, What's wrong with you? My battery broke, the doctor fixed it for me. I won't have to work for a while. Can I stay here with you? Alright. You can come and spend the night here and tell me stories, OK? Yay! You feeling much better? The doctor says the surgery went well. After two weeks of bed rest, I can get out. Relax and enjoy your off time. OK? But I'm so worried... About what? About all those things waiting for my attention. Work stuff, school stuff, cram school stuff... and Tiger... Miss Lefty, learn to be more like me, won't you? Things that can be resolved, work hard to untie the knot and resolve them. Things that cannot be resolved, please just cut them off. Mr. Lefty, should I cut you off, or try and untie the knot over your heart? Mr. Tie, there's a UFO! It's fireworks. Such beautiful fireworks. It was so wonderful. Santa Claus came in a UFO, gave me a healthy mommy and something extra... Mr. Tie. All of our wishes came true.
