I knew him as well as any fan can know him, you know? But I was never lucky enough to be able to actually shake hands with the guy. I wish I knew him like I know my best friend. His lyrics-- they just, like-- they talk to the man. I don't even know what that means. I don't even know why I said that. [Colin] You guys-- you guys could, you know, make up a verse, too. [interviewer] Where is he buried? Um, in a grave. I think he's buried in Texas. Seattle, right? St. Louis. That's-- that's where we're going. -♪ Sweaty balls -St. Louis. -In France. -[interviewer] France? -Yeah, in Paris. -♪ Sweaty balls I don't know. I don't know. But wherever it is, I'm going. [laughs] [Colin] Yeah, we'll lay it down for real now. ♪ Thank you, man. Anything to, you know, keep the memory of Colin alive. People need to know how amazing he was. I only miss the fact that I never got to have that last moment with him to tell him how much I hated him. He died long before he ever died. Do you know what I mean? [sniffling] He was taken from us too soon. ♪ [sobbing] He lives on in our hearts. ♪ This is, um, Colin Fitz, and I channeled this. And this is him. He's here. ♪
