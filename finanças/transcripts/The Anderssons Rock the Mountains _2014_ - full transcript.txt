Go, go, go, go! First of all— No, my name's not Sven. Secondly—I don't understand. How could it turn out like this? We'd better take it from the beginning. Be careful, that's my life you 're flushing away. Hey Hey! Here comes Sune. Not that far. Come on! Stop! That's where it all started, but it was in colour then. ♪ I'm a little pine cone, a cute little bud ♪ -♪ We are in the wide forest ... ♪ - Sune! Oh, they're so cute! - They're fantastic. - Sune! Hey! - You're annoying. - Why do they look like that? - They're cones. Like poop cones? Is that allowed? - Håkan, Håkan. To the camera. - Like poop cones? - Rudolf! ♪ be grateful for the air where you live ♪ - Wow, what ugly costumes. - This is how we dress at home. Trouble is we can't use pine needles. - Where do you get everything from, Sune? - Oh, here and there. - Is it difficult? - No, it's snow problem! Come with me sometime. Yule love it! - Maybe so. - Hi, Sune. - Hi, Sophie. - We're going to the mountains for sports holiday week. Can't you come too? - Are you out of your mind? - No, you go. I'll be here pine-ing for you! - Maybe. Can you remember if we decided to be together or not? - Good question. - I think we decided we were just friends. - Perfect - What d'you mean, perfect? - I told you: I'm going to the mountains. - So what? Wait, what do you mean? Bravo! Now the Headmistress is going to sing. - Thank you. - Not this year too, surely? - She does this every year. - And now, as tradition dictates, I will sing my own little song: "Hey, you happy compost". ♪ Hey, you happy compost ♪ ♪ you who give us all our food ♪ - Well hello! - Hands full, I see. - Let me help you. - We didn't see you. Maybe you were hiding from us? I would have if I'd been you! - Weren't they all good? - Especially the Headmistress. - The same awful song every year. So out of tune I get goosebumps! Look! It's standing up! Headmistress—Hello! You were really good. God, how embarrassing. - Relax. It'll be forgotten in 50-60 years. - So, mountains for the holidays as usual? - Of course. It'll be great. - Maybe you could join us some time. - Yes, absolutely. We'd love to. - You say that every year. - Then we'll have to say it every other year. - Well, see you in a week. - Have fun. - Thanks, bye! - Well, that was close. Go on holiday with the Blixt family? I'd rather stay inside a bank deposit box. That way you get to keep your stuff. Look. He ate the lot. - What's she doing? - You're not supposed to understand it. - It's just so silly— - Hi! - Hello. - Hi! - How's it going? - Fine! - How are you, Anna? Don't you usually break your knee on the sports holiday? - Yes—yes, that's right. Every time—completely knackered. - We're in a group going to the mountains. Swimming in an ice hole, riding a snowmobile. - What fun. I'm going to the mountains too. - Really? Great! - Where are you staying? - Red Row. - And the après-ski? - Easy! I know an awesome place— - Listen. - See you after the holiday, Anna. Sophie! What did you mean by "perfect"? - There'll be other guys up there. - Like who? - Well, Santos is going. - What? Sport-Santos? He can't even talk to girls. - Oh stop it. - No, ask him something. Anything you like. Santos! Sophie wants to know what time it is. - See? Who'd want to be good at sports? - Pass the ball, Sune! - Sune, that's probably not a good idea. Sune in the Mountains. Did that old man with the stick die, Mum? - No. He was trying to protect himself from the ball. - The headmistress got his stick in the face. - Yes, but everyone survived. - The ambulance came. - It was an animal ambulance, Håkan. - Animal ambulance? Why? - The headmistress got the stick in the face and fell backwards right on top of a miniature poodle. - Did the poodle make it? - Could you put on some music, Rudolf? - Yes. ♪ Can you take your dog with you to heaven? ♪ ♪ He's kind and he's been a true friend ♪ Rudolf, maybe we should think of something to do for the holiday. - Absolutely. How about baking muffins? - I was thinking of something a bit more exciting. - Danish pastry? Danish pastry with a little chocolate? - No, maybe go away somewhere. After all, we've had a tax rebate. - I've found a trip for the whole family to the Canary Islands. - Have you really? Oh Rudolf, why didn't you say something! - I called the travel agency. Do you know what they said? If we don't go, we save 48,000 kronor! - Rudolf—! Sune! - Håkan! - Sune was just showing me what he did with the ball at school. - You're not mature enough to handle round objects. - You're gonna fucking pay for this! - Did you hear that Santos and Sophie are going to the mountains? - Yes. What about it? - Aren't you feeling a little jealous? - Me, jealous? Are you kidding? Rudolf, the TV! No! - Hello. I hereby announce that there will be no TV during the sports holiday. You're welcome. We're going to the mountains for the holiday. There'll be other guys there. Look. Nooo! What should I do? Now? - Now? - Now! He's good! My dear family. Last night something completely unbelievable happened. - Wow! Did you pee yourself? - I had a dream. About a trip we're going on. One that'll have excitement, romance and song. - Hawaii? - The Skull Cave? - Paris? - Bengtsfors? - We're—going—to— - Into your imagination? - To the mountains with the Blixt family! - You should become a stand-up comedian! - And get the Nobel Prize for Comedy. - Don't be nasty. He's come up with a great suggestion-. - Exactly. - But completely, hellishly wrong. Because we will never go on holiday with the Blixt family. But it was funny. - Not even if they pay for it? - Stop! - What did you say? Did you say pay for it? - Yup. - Why would they want to pay for us? - Yes, why would they want to? They've finally realised— Realised how much they owe us. - Now they want to pay it back. - Yes! - Exactly. - Remember when we offered them the family pizza? Do you? And when they paid us back? Remember when they paid us back? - No. - No. Exactly. Because that never happened. They never pay us back. - The dresses, recipes, shoes, books, films— - Yes. Why didn't they say anything? - Why didn't they say anything? - We met them. - Wait. It's a surprise. - Is it a surprise? - Yes, a surprise. - Yes! That's what it is! - It's a surprise! Can we really accept it? Well? From the Blixt family? - You're right, Karin. We are the Andersson family. We don't fall for buttering up. That's how it is. Look what I found! - Håkan, only the essentials. - That's coming with us. We're going to the mountains! - No. No. Yes. Stop, stop. Stop. You can't take Mrs Gunnarsson's dog with you. You can't put it in a case. - That's it! It's full! - No—! It's going like clockwork. See you soon. I think you look very nice. - Me too. And they're easy to see. - It doesn't even have the right name. - We just grabbed what was closest, Sune. You look great. - Can I have your tickets?. - Good morning! We're a family. Anna! Anna! Håkan! Be careful! - I don't understand what we need all this stuff for. - What don't you understand? I only brought the bare essentials. I haven't brought anything unnecessary. What are the tents for? - You never know when catastrophe will strike, Karin. Then we'd have to survive in the wilderness. - Cata—What? - Where are they? - What did they say on the phone? Why are they coming here? - No idea. They just thanked us for the invitation. - Invitation? Did you invite them here? - Yes, but we do that every year. - Not because we want them to come, but just to be nice. - Family, keep in mind that they're paying. We have to be really nice. - We mustn't get carried away. - They'd better not think we're going to pay for everything. Rudolf is the most miserly person in the world. - Don't overdo it because they're paying. - Hello! Welcome to the mountains! How nice to be together. - Ragnar? - It'll be such fun! - Isn't Sophie here? - I paid for the tickets. So we can sort it out it later. No problem. Anna! So. Håkan! Sorry! - What did I say? It's starting already. - Look, Pär! - Look! A monster. - No, no, Håkan. It's impolite to point. You don't do that. He's not a monster just because he's ugly. - No, that! - Yes, Rudolf. That monster. - Children! Where do they get it from! - Where's Sophie? - She's training for Saturday's competition. - Can she do a slalom? - Of course. Everyone can! Yes, Rudolf is on his way in too. So it's important to be careful. - He could flatten the whole village. - Funny, Ragnar. You're a funny guy. - Storm Rudolf is incoming. - Yes, yes. - What's the difference? Sophie! I'm here now! Your favourite guy is in the mountains! Nearly there now. There's the big slope and this is the restaurant. - Spjället. - But—Ragnar—when's Sophie coming? - She's coming to the cottage. - I thought you wanted to have a look around. But no, the Anderssons don't want that. You want to go up to the cottage and unpack. But you do what you want, of course. - No no. We do what you want. - Good! - Could it get any better? A whole week's free mountain holiday. Thanks to you, Sune. - The world's best Sune-Pune. Piss-Nisse! Bastard! Who put that there! Hello. Welcome to Åsdalen's mountain hotel. - Pontus! What are you doing here? - Sabina and I took over the place. It was a dream we had. You have to follow your dreams. - We thought you were dreaming of Thailand. - Yes, but then we dreamed about this. - That's nice. - The most fun I had— - They left without cleaning in 4. The tap in 8 is leaking. You take the toilet in 1. - I have some new guests. - I can't deal with any more idiots. Well hello! How lovely! Welcome. What a wonderful dream! Here are your keys. There you are. - Don't worry about a thing. We're friends. We look after cleaning, toilets— rubbish, bedding—everything. Welcome to Fjällevision and hotel Åsdalen. Like last week, it looks like it'll be great ski weather in our area. Now, moving on to Hurricane Rudolf. A bit like another Rudolf I know. Complete disaster. - How can you be here and there? - A recording from last week. - I want to be on TV too. - No, you're too small. I thought you wanted separate rooms, but no, the Anderssons don't want that. You want to be able to sleep together. But you do what you want— - It'll be fine, just fine. - Yes, it'll certainly be very cosy— - I thought since we know each other so well we should ignore cleaning rotas. - Yes! - Oh yes. - But then I realized the Anderssons want order. Rudolf loves that. Meal rota, cleaning rota, rubbish rota, washing rota, cooking rota. We 're team 1, you're team 2. But of course you decide that yourselves. - Yes, and we mustn't forget the poop rota. - No! - Here it is. If you— It's only a small septic tank. To avoid the emptying fee, everyone does the big one out on the slopes— and the little one in here. - Yes. Unless you have an upset stomach. Then the big one doesn't count. - Remember, Ragnar? - Yes. That, yes, I do. - Dad, you'll have to poop on the slopes. - Well, it was this thing with the adventure package— We got it as a wedding gift. - Pontus, the adventure package. - Absolutely. Let's see. Yes, of course. We have one here. The adventure package— Here we are. This is the adventure package. - No no no—Håkan, wait! - Where's the ski rental? - In the rental kiosk, across the street. - Slalom equipment included. - Watch out for cars. - Right, left, kids! - That's lovely. The mountains! - Good morning and welcome. What can I do for you? - We want to hire skis. - Are you staying at the hotel? - Yes, you just checked us in. - Yes! I have to talk to the front desk later. - So let's see. Shoe size? Helmet? - I have boots, and I don't need a helmet. - Why wouldn't you wear a helmet? - I'm only going to do cross-country. - Cross country? No. The gentleman needs one of these little things here. - What's that? - A snowboard. Never seen one? - Of course I have. Give me the other one. - Dad, there's only one. - I know that. Give me the sticks. - This'll be mine in a few years. - Pick up sticks! I'll start. - It moved! I'll take this one. - What the hell—! - You're wearing skis, Jörgen. - Yes— - You're going to get a beating! - So are you! - Everything all right? - Don't hurt each other, guys. - That's the whole point! - No throwing snowballs! - Go to the children's group now. Let's see where the ski school is—There! - Who did that?! You mustn't throw snowballs. You can hurt someone! I get so angry... - Jörgen? - Oh! Sorry. Coming! - Piss-Nisse! —and teach us a little before— - Welcome. Sabina's ski school. Sabina takes care of the skiing and I do the booking. Do you want to sign up? - Gummi Bears? Mon amour! Where have you been all my life? Don't you look nice tonight! Sit down, and let me offer you supper. Hi, Sophie. - Hi, Sune. What are you up to? - Everything that two people could need in the mountains. - My favourite films and my favourite candy! - Come and sit down. - But—TV? We're going out on the slopes. - Nothing's getting me out on the slopes. - Okay, but that's a real shame. I'm going to get some practice in. Santos will be here soon. - No! Wait, Sophie! Sophie! - Wondering what it says. - I can read. It says: Warning: Precipice. - Who's Precipice? No clue. - Warning: Precipice. Another one! - They're everywhere. Finally something's happening! Precipice must be a very dangerous snow monster. - What? - He'll tear us apart! - You think so? - Sure. No! No no no! Hello everyone! That was close! Hi, Santos. Isn't it embarrassing how much fresh air you get in the mountains? Sophie, sports aren't something us normal people like. The two of us, when we were little, we always said sports are just for jerks. Remember that, Sophie? - What do you mean? - You used to say anyone who does sports and all that crap might as well be dead. Or was it me who said that? Doesn't matter. We're so alike! We think the same things. It's like we were made for each other! Think about it! We've known each other all our lives. And even today we're the best of best friends! D'you remember this? Diggi loo diggi lay, everyone looks at me as I walk in my golden shoes Then there's the dance! Sune, what are you doing? Are you jealous? - What? Me, jealous? Allow me to smile. - Santos, come on! I've marked a new course only we know. Don't trust anyone. - Who's that? - Santos's Dad. He wants Santos to win. - I've marked it here. - Isn't that cheating? - Santos, there's good and bad cheating. What we're doing is good cheating. - Aren't you afraid of heights? - No. I've got over that. Long time ago. - That's great, you can look after yourself. Check out the guy with the sledge. - So go on then! - Go, go, go, go! Hello, everyone, I'm Sabina, your ski instructor. Hi there! - Hi there! - Modern alpine downhill skiing was introduced in Sweden in 1934 by Sigge Bergman and Olle Rimfors. Interesting. ... towards the top of the mountain, that's the up ski. Then going down is the down ski. - No! It's the roller-coaster ski, isn't it? - Yes. - It doesn't matter. There. We're done with the introduction. See you tomorrow. - Aren't you going to teach us to ski? - Not today, no. Bye! - How do you turn, Jörgen? - Step over. Well done, Kicki! - Help! - Step over again— - What a speed! - Bloody hell! - What was that? Hello! Sune? Wake up, Sune! - Am I in heaven now? - No, you're in the push-button lift in Åre. - You know, I hate high places. I'm never going on a mountain again. Why did you go up then? - That Santos is trying to take Sophie from me. - Want a tip? Get him to make a fool of himself, and everything will work out. - Yes! That's great, Håkan. Can you dig me out now? Say: "Thank you, dear Håkan. You're best in the world. Please dig me up." - Stop fooling around. Dig. - Come on, Pär. - Okay, okay, okay! Thank you, dear Håkan. You're the best in the world. Now dig! - And me. - And Pär Pear. - And my tame worms Golge and Muttrick. - And your tame worms Golge and Muttrick! Dig me out now! - Come on time. There'll be lots of people. - That sounds like fun. Now go to the finish line. The professional skier Jon Olsson is there. Hurry up and get an autograph! Come on! - There you are. You're welcome. How hard can it be? To move forward, put on your boot. Put on your boot. - I've just done that. - "I'm a piece of shit." Did you say that? - Anna. - What?! - Try the boots on the other feet. It'll work much better. Stylish hat by the way. What if he bites though? - If he doesn't then he's not a real monster. - Perfect. This is everything we need to catch Precipice. Perfect. Put it there. The best way to catch monsters is to get them to lose their way. - With food. - Training is A and O and D and G! But we need to have fun too. - So say we'll have fun. - We'll have super fun. - There. You teach technique, I grind the skis. See you later. Hi, Santos. - Yeah. - Cool helmet. You're really good at skiing. I don't even understand how you do it. - Thanks. - Have you learned to talk to girls now? - Shut up! What are you doing? I might have a little problem talking to girls. - If you want, I could help you. - You think so? - Yep. - I don't see how. Get him to make a fool of himself. Santos, can you dance? - No. - Perfect. I'll fix that. Trust me. Hello. - Hi, Sune. - I want to register someone for the dance competition at the après-ski. Yeah, great! It starts at 1700 with my big opening number. Then everyone gets two minutes to dance. Then there's my big closing number. - Good! Make the coffee, whip the cream! Hot shot, hot shot, hot shot! Hello, Pontus! - Book a table with the maître d'. - No, Yvonne and Ragnar— - Hello! - Hello. Welcome. Have you booked a table? How many are you? Four? We'll probably manage that. Come on, welcome! - Family, remember that everything is free if you charge it to the room. - That reminds me of something— Guys, do you want some? - It's for everyone. - Yes! Ragnar and I love après-ski. It's the best. - You could say it's the same as after-work, but you've come from skiing. - We haven't been skiing. - Whoever's worked before after-work? - Excuse me. - Look at that! - Thank you, Sabina. Come and join us. - I can't, no time. Living the dream! Wow! You look completely—incredible. - I don't know— - Yeah it's brilliant! - It really doesn't feel natural. - Dance is rarely natural. - Mind you, I can't dance either. - Exactly, exactly. That's exactly why you should dance. You have to tackle your problems. Trust me. I'm the expert after all. Come on. Hello and welcome to après ski! We start with our popular dance competition Let's Dance! For everyone who's good at dancing. ♪ Willkommen, welcome, to our little show that's about to start ♪ - There probably aren't that many people. - There's a lot. - Ok, good luck now. - Aren't you coming with me? - I have to look after Håkan. - But Håkan's sitting out there. - Exactly. I take the chance when Håkan's not at home. It's you now. Good luck, go on! - Here we are! - Don't say that I helped you okay? - Why not? - Just promise. Break a leg! Have you seen my Winner-Santos? - Winner-Santos? Yes, actually. Winner-Santos! Welcome back to Let's Dance, where It's time for our next contestant in the competition. Here he is: Sport-Santos! Stop, stop! Turn off the music. - Come on, Santos. Breathe out! Let's see what the jury says. Dermot? - Well, I don't know what to say. That wasn't good at all, Santos. - I agree with Dermot. It wasn't your best dance, Santos. On the contrary. - Why are you always so kind? It was a disaster! Worst I've ever seen. You shouldn't be dancing, You should be in jail! Can we get the jury's votes? - The worst - Sorry. Total rubbish. - Not funny. A total shellacking! How are you feeling, Sophie? - I see now that I've bet on completely the wrong guy. - Now I know Sune's right for me. - Santos let himself down. So embarrassing! - If you're watching, Sune, can you forgive me? Can it be you and me again? Yeah, you're listening to "Night Owl" with Pontus Egonsson. Tonight I'm tasting lingonberries. A lingonberry is a small red berry. We might wonder why lingonberries are red. Good morning in the cottage! Time to wake up! Today it's team 2's turn to set up the breakfast buffet! It'll be fun to see what you've come up with. Eating rota, dishes rota, poop rota! It's insane. - Think free, then it'll be easier. - I think the price is a little too high. - Yes, you're right. - Good morning. - Good morning? - I'm a night watchman here. Wonderful seeing the expanses in the moonlight. The calm, the silence ... It's like a dream. Here you are. - What's this? - The breakfast bag you ordered. I moonlight and run errands on my kicksled. But don't tell Sabina. It's a secret. Have a nice day. See you later! - What're we going to do with all this? - Monsters love salami sandwiches. It's snowing—a lot, all over the mountain. - Hey, how did the après-ski go yesterday? I heard Santos was going to dance. - Was he a success? - Well, you should have been there. - I'm pretty glad I got out of it. Tell me anyway. First he came in looking a little lost. Like he'd been thrown on to the dance floor. But then something happened. Like he was in a trance. That's the best I've ever seen! - He was great. He's goodlooking, too. - He was absolutely wonderful. There. Here it is. - Jörgen? You've gone off a cliff now. Seriously, Håkan. I don't want to hunt monsters. I'd rather be in the cottage. - What would you be doing there? Crosswords? Watching Antiques Roadshow? - I like crosswords. - You can spend the rest of your life doing crosswords. - What are we going to do with the sausage? - You'll see. Sophie? - Yes? I forgot to ask about this thing with Santos. You said you were interested in him. - What? Did I? - Yes. At home, before we left. - I said that just to tease you. - What? I'm so stupid! I've been worried you were interested in Sport-Santos. - Yes. But I am now. You were right. We can still be friends. Isn't there a lot of washing up today? - Yes, but it was actually just a litt— - Then let's look at today's rota. Unless you have a better idea. - No, no. - I've got it. - Sorry I didn't hear you? - I have another idea. You can get lots of ideas, but they go Woosh. it doesn't mean anything. Everyone can be involved and decide. - Isn't that so, Ragnar? - Yes. - What does Karin want to do today then? - To be out on the slalom slope would be fun. - Why didn't you say that before? That's exactly what's on today's rota! Isn't it, Ragnar? Slalom slope, it says here. Yup. - I didn't see that! Sorry! - Well, it has to be a little—flexible. Isn't that so, Ragnar? - Oh yeah! It should be a little flexible. That's best. - Yes, yes. That's great. - Sven! Sven! What a triumph! It turned out exactly as you said it would. I thought you were lying. So—what's the next step? Should I meet Sophie now? - No you can't. You and your Dad have to get into training. I thought the competition was important. - Never mind that. I've been wondering what it's like to dance and hang out with girls. - Santos! Where are you? - Look! Here he comes. Bye. - Santos! - Sven, it's you and me now. I think I have the talent to enchant girls. - Sure— - Thank you! - The last one to the lift is a poop sausage! - What? - Rudolf! - Where's Karin? Where is Karin? - That's what you get! - Hello! We always have a coffee first. - Look out behind you. - Be careful! - Sorry. It just said click and so—Thanks. Sorry. - You look as if you need some help. Do you want to hang on? - Yes. Of course. Look after my mutts while I go to the toilet for a while? No, no. No! - What weather we're having! - Bloody Stockholmers. - Are you sure about this? - Yes. It's a monster trap. - What do we do when we catch Precipice? - Tame him and take him home. Then we go on tour with him and make a lot of money. And then he has a breakdown and gets sad. Then we release him. - Why should we catch him? - Shh! I heard something. Dad? What in—? Sandwich! No, the dogs! - We'll get hell for this. - The dogs! - So we take the chairlift now? - Oh yeah. That's best. - It's time for the après-ski now! - What the hell— You're the expert, but we've been here for hours now. What's the point? - When Sophie arrives, you push her over. - But isn't that kinda shitty? - You know, girls like that. Is it you or me who know this stuff? That way you show you're interested. Here she comes! Okay, let's go. - Thank you, Santos. You saved me. - What? - You have no idea what a hero Santos is. If I'm the coffee, he's the cream. He threw himself in front of me, risking his life. You should have seen it! It was like in a film! - It looked life-threatening. He-e-e e-lp! - What do you mean? Did you see it? - Sport-Santos trying to play superhero? Yes, I saw that. - I knew it! I told you you're jealous. - Of Sport-Santos? I don't think so. You know what? I hope you have a— —wonderful life together. Yes, a six again! It's fantastic! It's fantastic! One, two, three, four, five, six. Look, you've disappeared again. - It doesn't matter. - Mum, we're losing. - It's such fun to play with you. We start to argue with other families. - Three, three, three! - Over there, Ragnar. - Yes! A three. - No, it should be thrown again. We always do that in our family. - Yes, but in our family we actually get to change our mind. - He should throw again. - Shit. - No we don't. Not at all! - We certainly do. - Since when? - Since now. It counts, Ragnar. - So that's settled. Isn't that right, Karin? - Yes, absolutely. - So you're off the board, Rudolf. - Now it's my turn. - With a five, you can take Yvonne out. - Five, five! - Wait, Karin. You can take it, but maybe you should take that one? - Are you stupid? Take it, Mum! Now you have to start again, Yvonne. - That's how it goes sometimes! - I don't think it was very smart. - I don't see that it matters. It's only a game! - Ragnar, would you turn on the sauna? - Children, off to bed. - What? Why? - Go to bed! I think it's time we talked about some little details. - Yes. Of course we're thinking about money. It always comes as an nasty surprise when everything has to be settled. - You don't want that. - Nothing's free. The house. the food, the lift passes and everything we do together. These rotas I've done— We— So that everyone's happy, Ragnar and I have come up with a plan. We share everything, so there's no confusion. For our extra work in finding the house, Rudolf can mow our lawn a few times. Sharing! - Stop it, Håkan. - Wake up, Sune! - What have you got say in your defence? - Why did you say that the Blixts would pay? - Well? The truth, now! - Okay. It's like this— When I was three you left me in a grocery store. I decided then never to be alone in a grocery store again after closing. Another time I was teased at school for a pink bag I got from you. Then you told the class that all people are equal. - Do you remember what you said then? - No. - If you want a friend, you have to be a friend. Then I knew I had the best parents in the world. Even though I had nightmares for years after what happened in the grocery store. - I think that's why I lied. - Oh, Sune! Poor Sune-Pune. I understand you. - Sorry we were a little angry. It's—Sorry. - It doesn't matter, Dad, you do your best. No one can ask for more than that. - Thanks. - Thank you, Sune. Sorry. These are your costs so far. - This is crazy! It's crazy! I don't understand! - Rudolf, pull yourself together! - I don't want to live! Hold the lift-queue right there. This is wrong. Chocolate, spa, face peeling, sunscreen, ski goggles, ski trousers— yoga, pony riding, Jämtland Thai massage. - It was wonderful. We could have anything, you said, if we charged it to the room. - Did I say that? Those damned Blixts! Do you know what the worst is, Karin? - That I took the massage? - No. The worst thing is, we've wasted money on unnecessary pleasures. As if we were pleasure-loving millionaires. We're not! We're just normal nice. No. We've been unnecessarily nice to the Blixt family. - Is there a problem? - No— - Are you upset? - No it's fine. We were going to do some— - Outside the box. - Exactly. - We were thinking. - Something free, Dad? - Yes, exactly, something free. - Nothing's free in the mountains! - Right! Rudolf. Breathe. - Andersson family, grab the sticks. This is going to be fantastic. - You do have safety equipment, don't you? I'm thinking of Karin. - Karin is with me. What could go wrong? - I was talking about Storm Karin. - Now, family! Now we begin our holiday! - Yes, it's starting! Greetings to Yvonne. - Yeah yeah. - You dropped your stick. - Sven! Sven! Where are you going? - You were going to help me meet Sophie. - Look after yourself. I don't feel like it. Bye. And by the way, don't say Hi to Sophie from me. - Dad, tell us when it'll be fantastic. - Oh yes, I promise. - Dad? When's it going to be fantastic? - Soon! Soon, Håkan. Håkan? Now it's absolutely fantastic. - Fantastic? Where? I want to see it too. - It's here, now. - I don't get it. - Håkan, sometimes adults settle for very little when it comes to experiences. Practically nothing sometimes. - This is probably the tastiest orange I've ever eaten. - Dad, it's a little windy! - There's no danger, is there, Rudolf? - Okay. Children, how about pitching camp? - When's it going to be fantastic, Dad? - No, Rudolf. This doesn't feel right! - Camping's great! This is the life. We're on holiday now, my darlings! - Here's the opening! - Here's an end! - Anna, I've got you! - I have the stick here. - Why should I hold on to this? - Leave it there, Anna! Precipice! - Håkan! Håkan! No, come back! Hold on! - Are we going to die now? - No, little man, we're not going to die. - So why's Dad firing emergency rockets? - They're just New Year's rockets. - It feels like we're going to die. - Shh! Listen! ♪ A papaya coconut ♪ ♪ and a place in the sun ♪ ♪ yes, that's all it takes to thaw a frozen soul ♪ ♪ a papaya coconut ♪ ♪ lazing there by the pool ♪ - Rudolf! - Hi, hey, kids. - How cosy we have it, don't we! - Cosy? It's a snowstorm! - When do we get dinner? I'm as hungry as a wolf. - There's no danger, is there? - Don't ask me, you're the survival expert. - Yes, Pär, your turn. I can help you move three places. Honey, it's your turn. Right, I'll move you. And then you lose a piece. - It was much more fun when the Anderssons were here. Some are punished by God immediately. If you do something bad, you'll be punished immediately. Try to sleep now. Isn't this nice. - I think I lost my—my— I think I lost my best friend because I was stupid. Was that God? - No, friendship's not the same as God. It's more like a saucepan. Do you understand? - What? No. - No, it's more like a canvas. You pull and you tear together until you think: This can't go on. But—then you pull a little more. And so you think: No, this can't go on. But—then I pull a little more and we fight each other. You think: This can't go on. And so you pull— That should be enough. - Good night. Look, family, we're saved. - The mountain patrol. Hello! God be praised! Here you are! Thank you for saving us! There you are! Tell me when you're going to camp. You missed the fireworks yesterday just outside the cottage. Breakfast is ready. Early bird catches the worm. - Well hi! Welcome! It's your turn to wash up. Oh what the hell, you have to be a little flexible. Come here, sit down. Come on, here's breakfast. - Where have all the rotas gone? - What do we need rotas for? We know each other so well. - Well, if you don't want them— - No! Then we thought of offering food tonight. - Yes. - That won't be necessary. We'll be living in the 22 across the road from now on. - It's the same price. - We thought it would be for the best. But thanks for everything. - Bye, Pär. - Bye. Back out so Dad can come out. Bye. Yes, yes. Never mind. - It'll be good getting rid of them. - Yes, it's going to be nice. - Isn't it nice to be rid of them. - Being together means everything. - That's nice, Rudolf. Thanks, I know. Us against the world. - Isn't that right, Sune? Sune? Santos! Santos! - Sven! I thought you'd abandoned me. - I wasn't completely honest with you. But now I'm going to help you. Time to learn some real charm. - Yeah, it'll be great! - When are you going to see Sophie? - Tonight. - No time to lose. See you at the hotel. - Okay. - Santos! Where did you go? You just disappeared. I was standing alone cheering for gold. Talk to me about the weather. And then you talk to her. Come on. Maybe it's sn— sn—s— s-s-sn—s— - Snnooow. What's the problem? It's so simple! - I should stick to the slalom. - That's it! Look at it as a slalom race. When you see the girl, you go out and say: Hey, girl. Isn't this beautiful? Know what? I'm on my own, so— Give me a kiss. Hey, girl. I'm on my own. Then I'm across the line. So—I push myself forward— and say: Hey, I'm on my own, so give me a kiss. - Take it easy. Think about what to say. - I pee myself when I'm alone. Last but not least: surprise her with something nice. A chocolate ball? Would you like—? - What are you doing? - What are you up to? - That went well. What do you think? - It was him in the green hat. I was a bit hesitant at the end, but that's how it goes. - Santos—I think we— should maybe—run— Like now! - Where are you going? - Stop! Jörgen? You've got Capricciosa all over you! Wait, no, it's Vesuvio. - I wonder where they were going. - I wonder where they were going. - You've got skis, Sune? - Yes. You have to start somewhere. - Too bad it turned out like this. - Yes. C'est la vie. - You're not busy just now, are you? - Me? No. Have you talked to Santos? - We've a date tonight. Don't ruin it for us. The competition is tomorrow. I was going to ask him for tips. - Good luck. - C'est la vie. - We're doing a broadcast about Precipice. If you see anything— Sune, you know what? Me and Pär Pear are going to be on TV. - Yeah. That's nice. - What is it? Love problems? - Sophie wants Santos, but he doesn't understand. I promised to help Santos, but Sophie thinks I'm ruining everything. - You know what? That's easy. See you at the kiosk at half past seven. Bye! - What are they doing? - Yvonne's watching TV. - What are they doing? - Karin's watching TV and Rudolf is— - Watching me. - Rudolf? Håkan's on Fjällevision. - What? - Come here. - Håkan Bråkan and Pär Pear. - Oh, aren't they so cute! - Tell us about your investigation. - We're chasing a snow monster. We haven't caught it, but we've been close. We're wondering if anyone's seen the monster. - It's a life-threatening snow monster, more dangerous and bigger than you. - Sure. Ok, so now you're wondering where the monster is and maybe if it has a name? - Yes. Precipice. - Precipice? - Yes, Precipice. - Right. Ok, yes— - Every sign says: - Warning for Precipice. - Hasn't it struck you that maybe you read it wrong and that it says Precipitation? - No. I don't think you believe in it. - No, I don't. - Do you believe in Precipice then? - No, I don't believe in Precipice either. Right, now we move on to the evening's menu here at Åsdalen's mountain hotel— - Hey, the sound's gone. Nice. - Sune, here's all the stuff. The cord's for— - For connecting audio maybe? - This cord should fit nicely into this. This thingy needs to be with you. Talk into it. It's all connected up. Here's another gadget. And here's a camera. Take all this, so you can hear everything they say. I think that's all you need. Good luck with the date. - Håkan, do you know what you are? - Yes, a genius. - Yes. Rrrrrolling r— - Are you sure it works? - Trust me. Put that in your ear. Just repeat what I tell you, and everything'll be fine. Can you hear me? - I meant later. Not now. Hi. I'm here to meet Santos. - Ok. Just say what I tell you, Santos. Good luck. Hi. It's nice that you wanted to meet me. Shall we sit down? - Just sit down, stupid! - Just sit down, stupid. - No, not like that! - No, not like that. - No. How nice you look tonight. Sit yourself down and I'll fetch you a snack. - How nice you look tonight. Sit yourself down and I'll fetch you a smack. - So do you. - Sit down, you idiot! - Sit down, you idiot. - Maybe I should go. - No, no. Sorry. My upset stomach is bothering me. My upset stomach is bothering me. - Oh, I see. What a pain for you. Are you okay? - Smile. Remember to smile. - What? Maybe you could give me some good tips before the competition. - It's about winning. - You're right about that. Well said. - I don't think we should worry too much about the competition. - Okay. - We can talk about—us, can't we? - Of course. So let the last sweet years become the best in our lives. - Let the happiness we feel last a lifetime. - Let the happiness we feel last a lifetime. - A lifetime? - Are you sure you're all right? - Of course. - Of course. - Quite sure? - Honestly, I haven't felt this good since you brought chocolate when I had measles. - No. It was Sune who was ill. - No. - And what's that? It's Sune, isn't it. - Santos! Can you hear me? You have to follow the plan! Santos, hello! - I knew it. Bloody Sune! - Santos! Can you hear me? Well hello, Sophie! - You're here? In the food cellar? - Karl Sune Rudolf Andersson. You promised not to get involved. - I can exp— - I don't want to hear your explanations. Just once more and I won't talk to you ever again. Yes, but it— - It didn't go well, did it. - No. - I knew it. I should never have started charming girls. That's just not my thing. - What is your thing then? - I like skiing, I guess. What about you? - Right now? I truly have no idea. - Yeah, well. See you tomorrow then. Take it easy! Do you know where the competition is? - Up the slope there, then right. - Thanks. - This is like a dream, isn't it? - It's great, honey! - Rudolf, this may be completely weird of me, but— Maybe it'd be fun to watch the competition with the Blixt family? - Yes—that might be quite pleasant. Hello! We thought we could—watch the competition— - Jinx! - Then we can have lunch afterwards. - Yes, what a great idea! Come on! What fun! It feels like an eternity since we did something together. - Anna? Is that you? - Hello! - So you can ski? - Of course I can. - Stylish hat. - We might see each other at the après-ski. - If she gets down. - Maybe! - Here, I got some buns. - Cinnamon buns! That's Jon Olsson. - You look so good in those hats. - I've had logos before. - But yours was much more in fashion. - I was forced to wear mine. Welcome to Kläpprännet. Our annual youth competition where we discover this year's comets! - How about a sausage? - No! It's starting now. We have to go up. Maybe we can have a sausage, Rudolf? Rudolf! - What's the reindeer's name? - Irene. - Irene? - Yeah. - Sune! Shouldn't we go and cheer Sophie on? - No, that's not such a good idea. She's pretty upset with me at the moment. - That's good. - What? It is? - Yes, very good. It shows she cares. But if she says she hates you, it's all over. Forever. - Dad, you're eating reindeer poop. - Yes. Fresh reindeer poop directly from Irene. Refined. - Do you sell things like that? - Yes. - Good, I must say. Support the homeless mountain animals. 20 kronor. - Well now, it's time for this year's comets! First out is—Gro Brask. Go ahead and go, Gro! - New skis, Gunnar? - Yes. - Nice.

If nothing unforeseen happens she's heading for a clear win. - Oh Hell! - Sune? - Sophie? - Something unforeseen has happened— - Sophie, you mustn't be angry now. - Sune, I hate you. - No, I'm sorry. - Idiot! - Sophie! - Sune! What happened? Where's Sophie? - I saw her at the lift there. - Rudolf, he's here! Stop, stop, stop! We're closing the lift, it's freezing cold. - But why? It's working. - Not any more. Sophie! - What're you doing here? - I've come to rescue you. I know I haven't been completely honest. Sorry. - Is there anything else I should make a note of? - That I'm in love with you. - What? You just wanted to be friends. - I thought that's what you wanted. Sorry. I've always been in love with you. - I was winning. - Yes, I know, but— I've figured out how to solve it. Come on. Trust me—if you can. - Next skier: Thomas Torleifsson. - Santos, you have to help me. - Make it fast then. I'm going soon. Time for number 16: Santos Hernandez! This is the future of skiing in Sweden. - Team Santos! - Then we only have one skier left. Could Santos beat the leading time and win Kläpprännet?Let's find out! Bravo! - It'll be a great time. - Come on, Santos! It'll be the best time. It's absolutely incredible! - And he's finished! - Yes! Santos! There they got it, we won! Yes! Team Santos! - Yes! - But—it's Sophie! Bravo, Sophie! - Thanks. - Darling, you were absolutely superb! - Congratulations. - What a triumph! - You were great, sweetheart! What a superb race. Sophie, you really are the best. - But, Santos, you can talk. - You're right. Qué hice yo? What have I done wrong? - Will you have a problem now? - To hell with him. Besides, I already know what I want to do. Sune was right. Go Santos! - Can anyone compete in this? - Oh yeah! - Hello. - Can we sit here? - Aren't you working? - No, we're guests tonight. Some customers wanted to buy the hotel. They had a place in Thailand. We've been dreaming of going there, so now I've bought a hotel. It's like a dream. Hashtag: luxury. - It's like a dream, Jörgen. Isn't it? - Yes. - But, Jörgen— You'e got a horn on your forehead now. Sophie! Easy as pie! Well that's how it turned out. It doesn't get better than this— It gets much better than this! I knew it. Precipice! Hey! - No one would believe me anyway. English subtitles by faxeholm1234 and jeremys TNT 2022
