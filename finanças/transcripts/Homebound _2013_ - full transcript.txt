The cancer came back. - Why did you leave the hospital? - Well they told me what they had to say. (sad music) - It's that damn place that made you sick, isn't it? - What, the bar? How's that? - Being around those drunks all day. - Being around friends doesn't give you cancer. - I thought you had this thing beat. - Well apparently the cancer didn't get the news. - Oh don't make stupid jokes. - Well what the hell do you want me to do instead? Cry like a goddamn baby? It is what it is. (sighs) - Hey dad, man. Let's take you to California. - So this is what I need you to do, I need you to take care of the business. - We could take you to L.A. - For when I'm gone, make sure everything is settled. The doctors have given me a few weeks, so that gives you enough time. - They make new advances in medicine all the time. - Decide what to do with the house. - Okay, and I have the money, so I can pay for it. - Take care of the family, take care of grandma, then I gotta teach you how to run the bar. - Dad, you're not listening to me, we can get help, okay? - (shouts) It's done! Now I need you to do this! And then you can go back to your, so important life. (sad music) Good. Let's take a walk. We gotta make sure your grandma is taken care of. Her house is paid off, but, I wanna set up an account to take care of her monthly expenses. And I wanna set up an account to help your cousins out with school and stuff. - Dad. - And I gotta show you how to run the bar. - I'm not gonna that place. - That's okay, I got someone who can do it. Someone who's working there already. You just have to keep an eye on it. - What's this? - This is all gonna be yours. - [Richard] What do you mean? - Well, this is all ours. Now it's all yours. It was your mother's idea. She didn't like you traveling so far to school, so, she got this crazy idea of building one right next to the house. - How the hell?! - Yeah, we started buying all the land around us, but we never got around to building the school. First it was an elementary school, then it was a middle school, and then when you started playing football, she wanted to build a football field right over there. - No way. - Come on, I'll show ya. (sad music) - Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad. - Here it is. - Here's what? - This is for the hospital your mother wanted to build. - Hospital, why? - Well it was really more like a clinic. - How am I supposed to sell all this in a few weeks? - You do what you gotta do, son. I'm gonna miss that. - What? - The sunset. I don't want anybody to know. - Why? - I don't want pity. I got enough of that in my life. Gee, sunsets in Texas are... Like no other. (sad music) * When I die, I may not go to heaven * 'Cause I don't know if they let cowboys in * And if they don't just let me go to Texas * 'Cause Texas is as close as I've been * (laughter) - [Group] Happy birthday! - Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, I'm the Big Bad Wolf DJ Lobo and at this time, I'd like to give a big shout out, a birthday shout out, 14 years, to Dania Lyta from La Paz.

You know, hey! - Hmm? - You need to rest! - I'll rest when I'm dead. Okay. You need to take a look at these. This is uh... This is the deed to the house. And uh, this is my will. And I'm leaving everything to you. So, I need you to make sure that you distribute everything to the family. And I told your cousins that uh, whoever wanted to, could go to college, and I would help them. So, you need to create a trust for that. - Which cousins? - Whoever wants to. - And you can afford this? - I should have enough, I'm hoping one of them bites. There's documentation on the bar, okay? Now, you need to take a look at this, all right? - Got it. - All right. I made an appointment with Mr. Bonilla for today. He's a discreet man, so... Thing is, you're gonna have to go alone 'cause, I'm not feeling so hot today. - [Richard] You wanna go to the doctor? - No, just go talk to him. - Okay, boss. I told you I have to stay here and take care of some things. - But what about your promotion? People are talking. They're like vultures. - I'll call 'em tomorrow and I'm gonna make it all right. Julia, it's... I have to stay here and help my father. All right, he's... He's not doing too well and he doesn't want anyone to know but I know that I can tell you. He's sick. So, I'm trying to get him to go to the hospital. - You know what Rick, I have to go. - Hello? (sad music) - Well, trust funds are pretty easy to set up, you know, just have your dad give you the power of attorney... - He already has. - He has, huh? Hmm. Looks like everything is in order. Okay, well I'll start drafting the documents. - And the house? - The house, he wants to sell the house? - He just uh, wants to find out how much the property is worth. It's a midlife crisis. - Hmm-mm. Well, uhm, I'll have an appraiser look at it, okay? - [Richard] Okay. - [Mr. Bonilla] Give me a second. - Can I ask you a question? - [Mr. Bonilla] Sure, what is it? - How much do you think Sunnyside is worth? - Sunnyside? Yeah, there's no way your dad wants to sell Sunnyside. Is everything okay? - Yeah, everything is fine, I just wanna know how much the property itself is worth. - Well that land, I'll tell you right now, it's not fertile. - But somebody, I mean, should wanna buy it, it's right near the freeway. - There's a lot of history there. - Yeah well let's have an appraiser take a look at it anyway. - Of course. - You've been waiting for years? - Yeah. - Let me tell you something son, don't ever wait that long. Because this woman is gonna be gone. - No I know-- - Hey son! - I didn't think you'd be here. - Why wouldn't I?

They used to bring you after football practice. - Yeah, everyday. - Right? (laughter) Well let me show you around the place. You don't know the history behind this thing. You know this was gonna be, I think it was gonna be a bowling alley at one time. Yeah, we took it over.

What uh, what do you got going today? - I'm taking Sebastian to the beach. - You know he's been talking about going to the beach non-- (telephone ringing) - Gotta take this. Hello, Mr. Young. You know, the cat is almost in the bag, sir. - I need you back here, by Monday. - Sir, I'm gonna need a little more time. My father, he's still not a 100%. - People are waiting for me to announce the new management. - I've been putting in 60 hour weeks, all I'm asking for is a little time. - I can't do it, Rick. You get back here, or I'll find someone else. - There is no one else. - Thank you for the tickets. I had a great time, too bad they lost. - Yeah, too bad. (sad music) So how long has it been since you've been to the beach? (Sofia speaks Spanish) - She says a long time ago. The beach is fun! - [Richard] Not afraid of sharks, are you? - [Sebastian] No. - [Richard] All right. Are there sharks in Venezuela, Sofia? - Yes? - Sharks?

(Sofia speaks Spanish) - You're stubborn. (laughs) - [Richard] How did you like the beach? - It's awesome, but the water is brown. - The water is not brown. What color is it in Venezuela? - Clear, always blue. - Blue. - [Richard] Hey! I told Fred to come down to the beach. He showed up. - Just doing my thing. I'ma let it rain. I see the sun. (mumbling) everything. Get my mind clear. Sofia take it back, sing a song for us here. Now go ahead! (laughs) (laughter) (crowd muttering) - Come on Sofia! - Whatever, anything. - Anything!

(sad music) (flames burning) (door knocking) - You're not dressed yet, we're gonna be late. - Oh, I forgot mother. - Hurry, this is the day that we worship the Lord. - [Richard] Well, let me go wake up my dad. - Wake him, he's over at my house mowing the lawn. - What, he's not coming? - He doesn't go to church anymore ever since your mother... I tell him that it's a sin not to accept God's will, but he doesn't believe me. What's happening here, what's all this packing? - Didn't my dad tell you? - [Grandmother] Tell me what? - We're exterminating. - I told him he didn't keep this house clean enough. - You're right. - [Grandmother] Sofia can't do it all. - [Richard] Sofia? - Yes. Hurry, we're gonna be late. - [Richard] Is she coming? - She's a Catholic, I told you. - Oh, right. - Besides she's gonna meet us later at Lisa. Everybody is gonna be there, everybody wants to see you. - Oh shit. (gasps) - Richard Lynn Escamilla Pisalof. - Sorry mother, I meant dang. (church bell ringing) You have your own parking space, grandma? - God's helper of the month does. - That's nice. (communal music) - Oh my, if it isn't young Richard. - Hello Brother Mark. - It's so good to see you, I'm so glad you're here. - Thank you. - I told him to come and see you, brother. - Thank you, Sister Escamilla. I was raised by two very strong grandmothers. Now one of them was strict Southern Baptist and one was strict Church of Christ. I was in church seven days a week and still going to hell according to one or the other. (laughter) But faith isn't about the trappings. What we learned from our reading today, is that we can look a mirror and all we see is a cover of our true selves. But our souls, can be filled with hold. And whether you live in El Campo, or Southern California, you cannot hide from that truth. Amen and amen. - [Congregation] Amen and amen. * Amazing grace, how sweet the sound * That saved a wretch like me (relaxing music) (crowd muttering) - [Voiceover] Hello. - [Richard] Hello. - Look who's here. - [Voiceover] Richard Lynn, you have grown so much! And looks like you've grown up so much like your mother. - Ugh, heathens. They're always drinking. - [Voiceover] Mother, it's Sunday, they're just resting. - It's a sin. - And did Jesus not turn water into wine? - Back then wine had no alcohol. - [Voiceover] Hey Richard, how you been? Great to see you dude, I haven't seen you in a long time. - [Richard] Yeah, it's been a while. - Oh great man. - Man, I missed this. - So you're my cousin? - [Richard] Yeah? - Yeah. - Happy birthday. - Thanks man. - I remember you, when you were like, what, he was like this big? (laughter) - Lisa insisted in having brisket for you. - [Richard] Nah, you didn't have to do that. - Yo, I'm throwing up for you, man. - [Group] Hey, cheers. - Welcome back, congratulations. - It's good to be home. (relaxing music) (sighs) - That's Gilberto isn't it? - Hello familia! (the grandmother speaks Spanish) - [Grandmother] That's a nice bike. - Thank you mother. - But those things are dangerous. - I know (snickers). Ladies. - Look at that, John Wayne in the flesh, man. - That's right, thank you. - You, hey man, aren't you too old for that, man? - It's never too late, right son? - Yeah... - Better late, than never. So how's the brisket? - Man, it's freaking amazing! - [Voiceover] It's gotta be better than that, man. (laughter and crowd muttering) (telephone ringing) - [Julia] Hey Rick. - Where have you been? - I've been working, you know. - Is everything all right? - No, no, everything is not all right. You freaking left and you didn't even tell me. - Well I told you to come down for a couple of days. - Oh, and do what? You don't just walk away from your responsibilities. - I already told you, my father is sick, the least I could expect is some moral support from my girlfriend. - How long until you get back? - Until I have to. You know, I'm trying to explain to you, my father, I gotta be with my family. - I don't think this is gonna work out for me. I need a man who's not gonna throw his future away. - You know what, my family is calling me right now, Julia, you just do what you gotta do, okay? - [Grandmother] Well, I guess I wanna call it a day. I'm very tired and it is very hot. - Just stay. - No, no, no, no, no, I'm not comfortable anymore. I have to go. (playful cheering) (sad music) - Hey. - Hola. - Can I buy you a beer? I brought you a beer. - Gracias. Salud. - [Richard] Salud. What are you doing here? - Ah... (Sofia speaks Spanish) - I had a dream about you. I had a beautiful, "sueno" about you. - [Sofia] Si? - Si. (giggling) (crowd muttering and faint guitar playing) Look at that. - It's quite something, ain't it? - How often does the family get together? - Pft, every other week. - [Richard] And how's the farm running? - All right, we had to sell some of the land because of the drought. - Oh man, sorry to hear about that. - I didn't want to, but, I gotta do what the wife says. It's all good man, I wouldn't have it any other way. - Salud to that. - Yep. She's a looker huh? - Who? - Sofia, that's who. - Yeah, she's kinda cute. (laughs) What? - It's funny. Don't tell anybody I told you. A while back ago Gilberto and I, about a year ago, he was feeling kinda low. So, I took him over to the Gentlemen's Palace over there in Victoria. I didn't want Lisa to find out, so we went all the way over there. The man has needs. Pass me another beer. Well he sees her there and just falls for her. Next I thing I know, a couple of weeks later, she moves in with him. He must've gone back and convinced her. (ominous music and laughter) Ah... - Hmm. - He's so lucky, that son of a bitch, to have a woman like that. He's going to marry her. Let's toast to that. (laughs) (Jim laughs) Ah come on man, I'm just joking around, you don't have to get all mad and everything. - Oh, I'm not mad. - [Jim] Ah yeah, alright. - I'll be back. - [Jim] Hey, where you going, come on man?! You said you weren't mad! (Jim laughs) - [Richard] Fuck, I don't have a car. - [Sofia] Richard Lynn, Richard Lynn? - Leave me alone whore. You know that word, don't you? (Sofia speaks Spanish) Now that my dad's dieing you wanna fuck and suck him dry, don't you? - Gilberto die? - Don't act like you don't know. - No... I no whore, I no whore... (shouting) I no whore! - [Richard] June sixth, Sunnyside, goes to Sofia Palumbo? What is this? Hmm? You can't do this. - I know, I need your permission. - Why would I do that? - Well, because you hate the damn place. - Oh, it's fucking clear now huh? You wanted me back here so that I could sign these papers. (aggressive door knocking) (sad music) - What's wrong? - Why did you tell her, she's devastated. She's the last person I wanted to know. - I'm sorry. I didn't know about... I didn't know about you two. - What the hell are you talking about, Richard Lynn? - I know the two of you are together. - Who do the hell do you take me for?! - Jim told me everything that was going on. - How are you gonna listen to fucking Jim? He's a goddamn idiot! - Hey! Dad, sit down, sit down. (sad music) Let me get you some water. (grunting and heaving) (coughs) - I, I met her at that place. - [Richard] I understand. - She, she was working there as a cocktail waitress. - Waitress? - Yeah, yeah. She had such a special way about her, she... She didn't belong there. God, Richard, she glows just like your mom. Sebastian's father, he got really involved in politics down there. She was a news reporter. She did some story that he thought was anti-government, so... He, he turned her in. She's here under political asylum. - She can't go back? - Not now, who knows when. She's the one who took me to the hospital. And I lied to her. I told her I was fine. You gotta make sure that she's taken care of. You gotta promise. - I promise, okay, I promise. (doorbell ringing) (door knocking) Sofia? Sofia, I need to talk to you. Sofia? My dad gave me your address. - Gilberto is okay? - Yeah. Can I come in, please? Hey! Sofia, I'm sorry. I just really need to talk to you. Please, will you talk to me? - You call me, you say... - [Richard] I know, I know. I'm sorry I was a jerk. - Jerk? - [Richard] Yeah I was a jerk. (Sofia speaks Spanish) - (Spanish language), jerk? - Jerk is I don't... I don't know, I don't know how to explain jerk. It's what I was being. - Jerk? - You can call me jerk whenever. - Jerk. - [Richard] Yes. Can I come in? I just wanna say thank you. For, for being there for my father. When I wasn't. - That's okay. - I just... You know, I ran away when things got hard. I ran away from my family, my friends, everything that I knew. (Sofia speaks Spanish) You don't understand me? (Sofia speaks Spanish) I'm gonna make sure everything is okay with, with you and Sebastian. - Sebastian. - [Richard] Sebastian. (romantic, sad, Spanish music) - You good. (giggling) (Sofia speaks Spanish) (telephone ringing) - Hello? We gotta go. - I just gave him an injection, he's in and out of consciousness. - How did you... - He called me. - Can I go see him? - Go ahead. - [Sofia] He good? - He's doing okay, yeah. - [Sofia] Okay. - He's just in and out of consciousness, but he's resting comfortable, yes. (sad music) - [Richard] Dad? - Hey... - What happened? - Uh, I think the cancer got the news real quick, hehe... - You just need to rest. - There's something that I need to tell you. - Dad, don't talk like that, okay? - I know that you blame me for what happened to your mother. - Hey... Please. - That night at the bar. I tried to help her. But there was nothing any of us could've done. - [Richard] What do you mean? - [Gilberto] She had a weak heart, Richard Lynn. Do you remember, going in and out of the hospital? - Yeah. But she told me... - [Gilberto] Oh, she... She loved you so much, Richard Lynn. That's why she never told you. She wanted you to be so happy. To not worry about her. - Why didn't you tell me after she died? - Because I gave her my word that I wouldn't. She wanted you to remember her healthy, strong. I guess when I see her now, I'm gonna have to tell her that I broke my promise. - Dad forgive me. Forgive me for running away. - [Gilberto] You're home Rich... You're home... You're home Richard Lynn. Can I ask one last... Can I ask you a favor? (Richard cries and laughs at the same time) - [Richard] Another one? (Gilberto laughs) Anything. (sad music) (faint crying and church bell ringing) (the man speaks Spanish) - Ey yo Rick man, how you holding up? - All right. - Where you going? - [Grandmother] Richard Lynn! - I'm gonna go burn that place down. - Man come on Rick man, you ain't gonna burn nothing down. - [Richard] Told you I was. - Rick, where you going man? - I'm gonna burn the fucking place down, I already told you. - Rick come on man, you ain't gonna burn nothing down, get out the truck man. Hey come on, get out the truck. Rick, Rick! Get out the car, Rick! Rick! - [Sebastian] Rick!! (ominous music) (screeching brakes) - [Richard] Thank you everyone for coming, but please leave. Please leave. This is private property, leave! Leave, right now, leave!! - Hey yo Rick man, what you doing? - I'm burning this place down! - Come on man, I thought you was just playing! - I told you I was! - Rick Lynn, no! (shouts in Spanish) - My mother died here, my mother died here, I'm gonna burn this place down. - Tough times don't last, tough people do, come on man! - This place made my dad sick, it's cursed. - No, it's not! - [Richard] You said it yourself, grandma! You said it yourself! - I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I was wrong, I was wrong! - This place is cursed! (police sirens and crowd muttering) - What's going on here? - Please stop him, he says he's gonna burn down the place. - Gilberto saved for years to buy this place, so it could be the center of the town, so we could all come and get together here. (crowd shouting) Beautiful things have happened here! (sad music) (crowd shouting) - [Freddy C] Tough times don't last, tough people do man. - [Grandmother] Richard, Richard remember, remember? - I like this place, Richard Lynn. - I like it too. Hello Mr. Young, I'm sorry but uh, but I decided to take a better offer sir. Hey now, I wanna thank you, I really wanna thank you for the opportunity and everything you've done for me and just, I really hope you understand. All right sir, I'll talk to you soon. - This one is going out to the beautiful couple. Y'all put y'alls hands together. (applause) Oh yeah! (relaxing music)
