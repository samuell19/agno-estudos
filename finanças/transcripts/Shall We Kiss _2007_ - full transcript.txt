Excuse me. Where can I find a taxi around here? Let's see... around here? No, I don't know. Doesn't matter. I'll stop one. Thanks. Excuse me. Where are you heading? To hotel Dobr?e near the city hall. Are you passing through? Yes, I live in Paris. Do you come to Nantes often? - No, it's the first time. On business? Yes, I design furniture coverings. Usually I work at home, but sometimes one has to meet new suppliers. Excuse me, that door won't open from the inside. Thank you very much. When are you going back to Paris? - Tomorrow. See you later. Enjoy your stay. Pardon me. I haven't even introduced myself. I'm Gabriel. I'm Emily. Thanks. Thanks for this evening, for our conversation... ... for giving me a ride, for the excellent wine... ...for the bill, which you paid behind my back. And for giving me a good remembrance of Nantes. May I... I would like to give you one last memory. Excuse me. You don't have to excuse yourself. I'm not blaming you. I have to admit... ...I feel flattered. I think you're attractive as well, but... But? We'd better not. Are you in a relationship? Yes. Listen, I want to be honest with you. I'm living together with someone too. The kiss I wanted to give was just... ...a goodbye kiss. A kiss which meant... ...I really enjoyed spending these hours with you. A kiss without consequences? - Yes. I was thinking the same thing. - What's stopping you then? A story. A story? Which happened to you? No, about people I know. And that's why you don't want to kiss me tonight? Some stories get a grip on you even if you don't want it. I would like to tell it to you, so that you'll forgive me... ...but it's too personal. And it's late. I hope you understand. See you again some day. So you're not going to tell me the story? You?re saying it's too personal, but... I will never meet them... ...and I will never see you again either, right? You've made me curious. I wanted to get some sleep. - Tell me the moral of the story. To make a long story short, this girl was very happy. It's hard to tell if someone's really happy... ...but I think she was. She's living in Paris and is my age. Don't think I'm hiding behind a personage. Her name's Judith. And she doesn't look like me. She loved her job. She analyzes or does research in laboratory. Or something like that. She was even happier because she didn't need to work. Claudio, her husband, had already suggested her to quit. He made good money. His family was rich and helped him with the purchase of a pharmacy She refused, because she worked hard to achieve this... ...and didn't want to be a housewife. Not yet anyway. She wanted to stop working when she would get children. For a while at least. Because they both wanted children. Yes. She was happy. Among Judith's friends there was one more special than the others. She knew him since high school. They told each other all their secrets. The knew each others lovers. Because Claudio worked every Saturday Judith and Nicolas met... ...to talk about the past week, their concerns, their problems... ...their big and small pleasures. Questions about life... ...feelings, desires. Everything. Judith was fascinated he confided in her so easily. This trust and openness... ...encouraged her to share her most intimate feelings with him. She loved that, really. It was Judith who introduced Louise to Nicolas. They got along right away. Really very nicely. Two years later, when Louise got a good job abroad... ...they split up. But they stayed friends. Judith was worried about Nicolas. But he seemed to be doing fine. She was impressed. But a few months later it felt different when they were together. She suspected he was hiding something. That had never happened before. Then, one day... On a Thursday, around a quarter to four, I think. Excuse me... I'll be right back. Yes, it's me. I'm sorry to disturb you. I know you're at work, but... I want to see you as soon as possible. It's pretty urgent. No, I can't talk about it over the phone. What's the matter? I can only tell you, but I don't know if I can manage it. Is something wrong? - Yes. It's serious? It's gnawing at me. That's it, it's gnawing at me. Physically or psychically? - Both really. Why? This might sound strange... ...but some people have a shortage of vitamins, iron or magnesium. I lack... ...affection. But there are a lot of people around you who love you? I don't mean that kind of affection. Which one then? - I mean... A different kind of affection. - What kind? I miss physical affection. Physical affection? Don't you get what I mean? Not really. When two people are crazy about each other... Physically, I mean. I hunger for love so much, I can't think about anything else. It occupies me so much... ...I'm starting to feel ill about it. It's like having a splinter in one's buttock. Not really bad... ...and still it can really upset a person. When you're living together with someone, your partner can remove it... ...but I'm alone. You think I'm ridiculous, right? - No. Yes, you do. I think it's preposterous myself, compared to the big problems around us. A serious illness does not stop you from doing something about a cold. You have to get treated. - I know, but I don't know how. No doctor or medicine can cure it. And meeting someone? I mean, a woman who can remove the splinter? I guess that's what I need. But I don't want to meet a girl just to remove a splinter. That wouldn't be fair. - That's true. Maybe you can try to have feelings for her. I have no feelings, The way I'm feeling right now. I'm too obsessed. You know, there's a kind of nurse who can treat your illness. I mean, have you thought about seeing a prostitute? Yes, I thought about it, but... I don't think that's what I need. You can only tell once you tried. Well... ...I saw one this morning. And what was it like? Tell me. I wanted to go for a few days, because I thought it would help. Then I saw a report on TV about the way things work nowadays. To get in touch with a girl you have to get on the internet. Are you joining me for lunch? - No, I have to... I have to mark some papers. Don't wait for me. l don't have internet, so I used the computer in the teachers' room. Excuse me, sir. I noticed you're still here. I just wanted to say... - Yes? You left your pencil in the class room. Put it over there. Yes, there. Bye. - Thanks, bye. l randomly chose a girl. There were pictures, but one couldn't see their faces. I chose her because of her name really. Eglantine. l don't know if it's her real name, but I liked the way it sounded. There was a phone number. I called it. We met at her place. Well, across the street from her place As a precaution, I used a false name Hello, it's Fr?d?ric. Yes, I'm in front of number 11. Really? She asked me to cross the street Yes, I see it. OK, good. See you in a moment. Later I understood why. She could observe me from her window. and check if I was eligible. Come in. Oh right, excuse me. It's for sex isn't it? Yes, if that's not a problem? The bath room is over there. Get in while I prepare myself. Do I have to wait for you there? - No, take a shower. Here's a towel. I'll be waiting upstairs. But I already took a shower this morning. Sorry, it's a matter of hygiene. And it applies to everyone. I didn't know that. Do I have to wash my hair? Of course. If x goes with e, 0 times x gives 0. 0 is not reducible, for the space below 0 can't be reduced... ...to 0 and e. Do you understand? So if q is smaller than e and n greater than 2, q goes with 1. So if you have psy from ei, this equals ei+1. When i from 1 ... I'll call you back later. Excuse me, I didn't hear you come in. Doesn't matter. Are you coming? What are you doing? I wanted to kiss you. But there will be no kissing. I was speechless. I didn't know that either. I left without asking my money back. - Why? I can't do it without kissing. - Really? Maybe I'm not normal, but I have a need for tenderness. And that means kissing. I'm sure there's a solution. Even though I can't think of one right now. A solution is possible. But it's an obvious one. - Which one? No use telling you it. - Why? Tell me. Talking about something impossible is an unnecessary waste of time. How do you know it's unnecessary? - I assume it is. Then you don't know it for sure. Maybe it will give you an idea you hadn't thought about yet. Maybe, that's true. Tell me. Look, I thought... ...because of our relationship... ...maybe you could cure me. How? Because of our intimacy... ...the trust and understanding which exists between us. Look... I won't bother you with my problems. That's normal among friends. I'd be willing to help you, but... I see. It doesn't matter. It's because you asked. Why don't you ask another girlfriend? H?l?ne or Sophie? You're my best girlfriend... ...who understands everything. I wouldn't dare asking them. When do you want us to do it? I'll leave it up to you. - Let's do it now. Let's get it over with. Why not? That's a good idea. Shall I get undressed or do you want to do it? Do you mind if we take our time? I've got all the time in the world. Can I sit down? - Of course. Are you coming? Tell what you'd want. Oh, everything you want. I'm like that. I enjoy giving my partner pleasure. We are alike. Shall we start? Go ahead. Can I touch you? Can I touch your breasts? Is that enjoyable? I allow myself to enjoy it, because you said you like that. Thanks. That gives me pleasure. Are you still enjoying it? Can I stroke your other breast? Do you want me to lie down? Shall I continue? Can I close my eyes? Will you think of Claudio then? Not at all. He rarely strokes my breasts. And when he does, it's not the same. How? He's... ...rougher. What do you like more? I don't know. Depends on how I'm feeling. Can I move my hand across your body? What's the matter? Sorry, my throat is dry. I'm getting a glass of water. Do you want one as well? Do you mind if I put on some music? Do you want me to assume the same position? If you want. - No, if you want. Maybe we can get undressed first? Ready. Me too. May I kiss you? Do you really want to? Don't you want it? It's just that... ...if I won't like it, I might not be able to continue. It's easier for me to do it with someone whom I've never kissed... ...than with someone I'm crazy about who isn't a good kisser. That's why prostitutes don't want to kiss. If you really want to kiss me... ...you'll run the risk I will withdraw afterwards. I'll take the risk. Otherwise I won't be able to do it. But please tell me if you like the way I kiss. I don't want to force you. OK, I promise. Was that OK? Can I use my tongue now? And I wanted to go to bed early. What time is it? Half past eleven. - Already? I'll try to tell the rest of the story quickly. - I'm all ears. After a month Judith and Nicolas met again. I don't why they didn't see each other sooner. Are you doing well? And you? - All right. Oh, before I forget... I met someone. - Really? Yes. But that's great. What's her name? - C?line. C?line. Nice name. Yes, I think so too. So you're happy? Yes, very happy. You must feel all light-headed, sucked in by love. I didn't fall in love head over heels. But you're in love, right? Yes... It's still too early to tell, but I feel it's possible... ...I'm falling in love. I think it will grow slowly. You like her, don't you? - Of course. Do you want to see a picture of her? She's pretty. Do you fancy each other? - Yes, I was attracted to her immediately. We get along really well. We talk a lot. That's important in a relationship. You'll find out she's really nice. I was lucky to have met her. Are your worries gone now? Cured for once and always? Is something wrong Well... Not really. - Tell me. Everything's fine. Really well, but... But? It's silly... ...but when I kiss her, it's all right. Well... But? But... It's just completely different with you. I'll try to forget it, but I can't. Ever since that kiss Claudio and I are... Everything's all right, but it's not the same. It seems less... Do you understand what I mean? You mean for you it's like that as well... It's all my fault. - No, it's no one's fault. We haven't been honest about our feelings. We haven't judged the situation well. It's a damned memory. It's no memory but an illusion. That's all. If we would do it again, we'll notice it's nothing special. You think so? I'm sure. Every psychologist will tell us that. So there's no other remedy? I don't think so. And you? I'll have to think about it. For how long? - I don't know. Even if I take my time, then I still don't know if I'll find something. The problem is: I'm in a rush. Claudio and I are taking a vacation. I'd like to resolve this first. Yes, I wouldn?t want it to get in the way of my relationship either. What shall we do? - Whatever you want. Do you think it's OK if we do it now? - OK, short and snappy... Short, but not snappy, we'll have to try our best... ...to refute our memory. Good idea. Let's do it mechanically. Totally fine. - Where shall we do it? Let's do it on the floor. It'll be less comfortable that way. How did it go for you? And you? - No, you first. You won't be mad if I tell you the truth? To tell you the truth... It was... It was fantastic. Even better than the first time. I'm sorry. I didn't do it on purpose. Far from it. Are you angry? - Yes. But I'm angry with myself, not you. I thought it was great too. Damn it... Let's do it again right away. That way we'll know for sure. Yes, let's leave this behind us as soon as possible. What shall we do now? Let's give it our best shot. But that's not what we want. Think. Now we've accomplished what we didn't want. If we try what we don't want, we might get what we do want. Maybe you're right. So let's try everything. All right? I'm betting it was still great? You're right. I don't know why, but it was clear. I hope I haven't hurt you. I haven't done this before. It's strange. It didn't hurt before. On the contrary. What shall we do? - I can't think straight. Oh no. - What's the matter? It's terrible. I want to kiss you again, just like that, spontaneously. Please don't say that. It's terrible. It's coming. Your mouth. What about my mouth? When I see it before me, it attracts me. I'm restraining myself, otherwise I'd give it to you. Restrain yourself, I can't do it by myself. I'm trying. But maybe we shouldn't stand so close to each other. You're right. What will happen to us now? - I wish I knew. Don't you think it's... - What? How shall I put it? Love? I don?t think so. And you? - No, I don't know. I wonder. I'm just saying. If you're not sure, you'll have to consider every possibility. But we fancy each other, don't we? Yes, but it's friendship. - You're right. But there's love among friends... ...because one likes to see and spoil them. Yes, but it's not the same as being in love. Naturally. But what does love have extra? There's force of attraction. - Sure. But isn't that happening between us? In love there's mutual attraction. One agrees being attracted to each other. We're experiencing that as well... ...but without wanting it both. - You're right. But doesn't that happen in a case of love at first sight? I don't know. I just know I'm in love with Claudio. You're lucky. - Why? It's clear to you. I'm starting to doubt. About your infatuation for C?line? - A little bit... What about love, friendship, attraction, understanding? I'm getting a bit confused. You're not really helping here. You shouldn't doubt. I'm sorry. You're in love with C?line. - I am? Of course you are. Let's not make a big deal out of it We'll laugh about this in a few days, you'll see. But they didn't, right? No. I'm ordering another. I'm thirsty as well. But it will be my last one. I'm going to sleep. Excuse me, the same please. Sorry, the bar is closed. I just wanted to ask you to leave. Can't we have a last drink? We'll finish it at the reception. Sorry, sir. I can't pour liquor outside the bar after closing-time. I would like to do it, but if the manager finds out... I'm still on trial. I understand. - Thank you, sir. Is there a bar around here? I think everything's closed by now. You could try the station. Don't mind the mess. I wasn't expecting anyone tonight. Do you want a drink? - Yes, please. Did you make that? - Yes. It's really beautiful. I'd like to have such curtains as well. Thanks you, but I won't sell them to you. - Why not? I'm telling you this story because we don't know each other. If I were to sell you that fabric, we'd have to exchange addresses. We'd have to talk again... ...maybe meet again. It's too late now. When the story's over, we won't see each other again. Too bad for my business. Too bad for me. Can I lie down? My back hurts. Go ahead. Can I take off my shoes? Yes... Have a seat. This way I'll know you're still listening to me. You're right. I must focus my attention. Where was I? - At the point... ...where Judith and Nicolas were wondering if they'd fallen in love. I think they're in love... ...but don't want to know it. Which makes me think of a story. - A story? Which story? - I don't want to interrupt your story. I won't mind taking a break. Unless it's too long... It's short, very short. It happened two years ago. On a weekday. l was practically alone at the museum when I saw a girlfriend. Well, not a girlfriend. The girlfriend of a good friend. Often I feel uncomfortable around partners of friends. One has to hold oneself back not to find them attractive... ...but still act like a friend while one really isn't. Gabri?l? How are you? - Fine. And you? Very well. Visiting the museum too? - Yes. Me too. So everything?s fine? - A lot has changed. Like what? Haven't you heard? - No. Fran?ois left me for another woman two months ago. Really? I didn't know that. I'm sorry. Don't be. It isn't your fault. It might sound strange... ...but I feel much happier now. No, honestly. It's not to convince myself or so you'll tell him. I'm feeling better. Can you tell? Well... Sure. It has taught me I have become another person. More independent... ...lighter, more open to new things. Much more free. I surely wouldn't want another relationship for example. Even if you meet a nice man? - Then I'll go for it, give myself. I won't ask questions. I'll expose myself completely, on condition that it won't last long. Even if it's fantastic? - Yes. I only want adventures. I want them to be brief and just deal with pleasure. I don't want them to get serious. I want to try out all the good things in life. Does that shock you? It's an amusing story... ...but where's the connection? I'm not finished yet. We've been living together since then. Are you still together? - Yes. She's my partner. That's why Nicolas and Judith remind me of this story. One falls in love when one expects it the least. I think they love each other... ...but don't realize it. That's right. But they knew soon enough. They hadn't seen each other for a few weeks... ...and all seemed to go well. Excuse me, but I have to talk to you. Not here, everyone can see us. Come. What's going on? You're scaring me. I want to tell you two things. First, I have thought about it. I love you. Now I'm sure of it. I really love you. Secondly, I know it's not convenient now. I shouldn't bother you anymore. So you'll have to help me not to love you anymore. I want a "No" from you on all accounts. I have to feel it's mutual, so I can move on, you understand? So... Look me straight in the eye and tell me you aren't in love with me. Go on. OK, let's try something else. I'll try to kiss you... ...and you'll push me away to make me comprehend. OK, here it goes. Go on, push me away. I'll start over. If you don't react, I don't know what to do anymore. I think I'll have to be ruder. So you'll really react. I see no other way. Still not a word? You won't get angry with me? Please tell me you're angry. All right... Look what I'm doing. So you see what I'm doing? Tell me you don't want it. Tell me. Please, tell me. I'm looking for Judith. Sorry. Have you seen Judith? Thank you. There you are. I had lost you. - Yes, we were talking. Yes, you know, I needed to tell her something. Nothing serious? - No. But it felt good telling her. Swell. A woman once told me: ''My ideal man is not my lover... ...it's the one I love tenderly and peacefully... ...and whom I'm never jealous at''. Funny woman. She was an old woman. But I think it makes sense. Don't you? Too sensible for my taste. I have a friend who says: ''You can only be sensible if you're crazy''. I think he's right. I haven't been crazy enough to become really sensible. And you? I don't know. Look, it's one o'clock already. And I'm in a hotel room, tipsy, with a man I hardly know. I think this answers your question. I think you're very sensible. More so than me. But I haven't spoken about the terrible consequences yet. Why ''terrible''? If it wasn't so terrible, it wouldn't have affected me that much... ...and I would have kissed you before... ...and God knows what we would be doing now. The story of Judith and Nicolas may seem attractive up until now. But in the story you just told, you and your friend were alone. They weren't. To their mutual partners... ...they tried as hard as possible not to arouse any suspicion. They didn't know what to hope for... ...what to think. Maybe it was just a fantasy which would blow over soon. Or if was a need for change. something to avoid the routine of daily life? Maybe it wasn't love, but physical attraction. A story of pheromones. A biological phenomenon? "Maybe I'm not like others, too weak to be guided by reason"... ...Judith thought. ''Maybe I'm a selfish monster led by sexual instincts''... ...Nicolas thought. ''How can one hope for world peace with immoral women like me around?'' ''It's because of people like me no civilization develops in a harmonious manner?'' ''Must one make a mess of one's life for kisses and embraces?'' ''What if it's not just kisses and embraces... ''...but a special relationship?'' ''What if it would be a love story like in novels and films?'' What's the matter? - We shouldn't do it. Don't you want it? - Yes I do... But I have to make love to Claudio. It's been such a long time. Why are you looking like that? Are you jealous? - A little. Shall I think of you? That way I wouldn't be cheating on you. You're jealous. Yes, but I understand. This way I can make love to C?line without having to feel too much guilt. Are you going to make love tonight? I have to. You don't want me to break up. I said it because of us. I don't want you to be alone if I'm not. I would feel so guilty, knowing you would be alone. I think I'm better of by myself. - But C?line's nice... That's why I feel guilty, because I don't love her. She deserves better. Claudio deserves better as well. Tell me if I should put on something else. I have to talk to you. Please don't look at me. You're wondering what I want. The tone of my voice worries you. I can't see your face, but I think you're looking gloomy already. My words aren't reassuring... ...while I'd very much like them to be. My words mean no harm... ...but they'll hurt you anyway. I know they'll hurt you for sure. I can hear your heart. Your beautiful heart is panicking. Because of me. I would very much like to embrace you, but I can't. I shouldn't. Yes, I'm no longer yours. And yet... ...a part of me... ...will always be yours. Just a part. The other, bigger part... ...now belongs to someone else without me noticing it. I haven't chosen it. It just happened. I can't help it. But I won't be far. We can stay neighbors, I hope. I'm already regretting leaving you... ...but even more if I wouldn't do it. To comfort you, remember this: I will spare you my regrets. Someone else will have to listen to them. Do you want to hear something else? I'll get a drink. Want one? What are you thinking about? I'm imagining this house is ours... ...and I'll end up in your arms each day. How would you make that happen? - What? By living together. We have to tell Claudio and C?line and find a place. What's the matter? I'm never able to leave Claudio. I can't hurt him. I can't bear to see him suffer because of me. Doesn't your cocktail taste good? I'm not really thirsty. Are you feeling all right? - Yes. Well... no, not really. What's the matter? I'd rather tell you after dinner. Why? It would spoil your appetite. - Nothing can spoil my appetite. When my father died, everyone was surprised I was eating. They thought I wasn't sad. But that's who I am. Well OK... I think the time has come... ...for us to split up. It isn't your fault. I'm not blaming you for anything. On the contrary, you're... ...fantastic. But it's not exactly a ''love story'' between us. That's true. But it could be. with a little effort. That's what I said to myself too. But I haven't been making an effort lately, haven't I? You seemed absent. Have you met someone else? Yes, and... ...unfortunately it's true love. Why "unfortunately"? Because it's not convenient for her at this time. And neither for us. It would be better if we'd carry on together. You can't have everything in life. Your acting strange. Aren't you angry with me? Don't you think monsters like me shouldn't exists? I'm a fatalist. What do you mean by that? Imagine... ...walking somewhere and being hit by a cyclist. You get hurt. All you can do is wait until your wounds are healed. Complaining about it doesn't help. Aren't you just a little angry with the cyclist? Why? Your wounds won't heal any faster because of it. It's not the cyclist's fault. He didn't do it on purpose. That's right, but you can also blame him for not being careful enough. But it requires experience to be careful. You can't blame someone for not having experience. That's absolutely true. Very nicely put. I had to leave you to discover your hidden charms. Thanks, that's sweet. I'd almost want to kiss you. - It's too late for that now... Yes, that's true. But if you want to, you may kiss me on the cheek. Did I gain a girlfriend? And I a friend? The ways to friendship are just as strange as those to love. What did you say then? The ways to friendship... I'm not sure whether I said: ''The ways to friendship are just as strange as those to love.'' I think I had this idea this morning. It occurred to me then. She really is a great girl. - Yes, she's really... ...great. Why are you looking like that? I was never jealous of her, but if she becomes a girlfriend... If life would be fair, Claudio would meet someone else. That's it, you've got it. What? - You just said it. If he met someone, you wouldn't have to leave him. He would. He wouldn't mind leaving you and he would be happy to see us together. He wouldn't even have to feel guilty. Hello. I'm afraid I don't have much time. What do you want to tell me? Well... I want to know if you're still single. Nicolas, you know... I've thought about it. You were right, we're not really suited for each other. I don't know if I want to give it another shot. - But this isn't about us. I want to know whether you're prepared... ...to meet someone. To meet someone? - A good person, much better than me. What's this all about? It's a bit complicated, but I'll explain. So I was thinking of you. You've got nothing to lose since you're still single. You're terrible. - Why? No, nothing You were supposed to meet other men. I'm asking you to meet one more. if you like him, great. If you don't, too bad. See.. I've got a picture of him. What do you think? He looks nice. - He looks a lot better in person. I'm willing to meet him, but just because of you. There's a chance of one in a thousand we'll fancy each other. I know, even if it's one in a million, it's our only hope. Thank you, C?line. Thanks. I have to go. I'll call you when I get back. Nice to meet you.. Nicolas has told me a lot about you. - Me too. Good to see you. Would you like a drink? - No, thanks you. Yes, it's... That's him. Nicolas already showed me a picture. This... This picture is newer. Excuse me. Sorry, I'm late. So you've met? Well... We came up with something. Tell me if you agree. It's complicated, but we're willing to give it a go. And you as well, I hope. Claudio's somewhat special. He never showed interest in other women. That's our biggest problem. That's why we have searched for a way to make him interested in you. And Schubert came out. Schubert? - Yes, Schubert, the composer. He's very much interested in Schubert. He knows his music by heart... ...and has read everything about him. If he were to meet a woman who'd share his passion... ...then something might happen. Judith, tell her the plan. Here it is. Claudio works every day at the pharmacy close to the Parc Monceau. Every Thursday around 12 o'clock he leaves his job. He's taking tennis lessons in the Bois de Boulogne. After his lesson, around 2 o'clock, he doesn't go back right away. He always eats a sandwich at the same place. He likes the silence there, and the view through the large windows. He'll stay there until around 3 o'clock. Sometimes he reads, or listens to music on his walkman. Sometimes he's daydreaming. You'll have to wait for him there with this book. It's a new Schubert biography I've ordered on the internet. When he sees it, he will surely ask where it has been bought. Gee, I know nothing about Schubert. That doesn't matter. Tell him you've just discovered him. He'll be delighted to talk about his hobby. OK? Is everything clear? To be honest... ...I think it's all a bit thin. You never know. What's the matter? - Nothing. Is something bad going to happen to me? No, on the contrary. What will happen is... ...great. Then why are you looking like that? Because it's isn't great for me. - I don't understand it. You will meet someone. - And? Someone you'll fall in love with. Very soon, it can happen every day. What? - The cards are crystal clear. You don't have to worry. That's nonsense. Come here. It's not nonsense. Bye, I'll see you tonight. What's the matter? You said bye like you meant "farewell". Don't tell me it's still those cards. This is getting ridiculous. Don't worry, we'll see. You're totally bonkers. I'm going. I don't want to hear anything about it. Yes, it's me. He just left. The day went by slowly. It didn't seem to end for Judith and Nicolas. A bit of silence, please. The arranged time has passed since a long time. They still hadn't heard anything from C?line. Sorry, I... Yes, it's me. Heard anything yet? No, she still hasn't called. Have you heard anything? No he hasn't returned to the pharmacy yet. He doesn't answer his mobile phone. They should still be together. C?line knows she's supposed to call when she's alone. At nine o'clock Claudio still hadn't returned home, and no news from C?line. How is that possible? Surely she would have time to make a call? If Claudio hadn't returned, things must have gone well with C?line. Nothing really went as planned. Do you remember Claudio leaving in the morning? Bye, I'll see you tonight. What's the matter? You said bye like you meant "farewell". Don't tell me it's still those cards. Don't worry, we'll see. This is starting to get ridiculous. I'm going. I don't want to hear anything about it. He just left. Yes, he's got his tennis racket with him. It's not raining, so I think he'll go I'm sure of it. Yes, I've laid down the cards, but I'm not proud of myself. It wasn't a good idea. He didn't believe it. Nicolas? I can't hear you. Can you hear me? Have you talked to C?line? Good, tell her to be there before 2 o'clock... ...and to bring the book about Schubert. Let's keep our fingers crossed... I love you too. Call me when you've heard something from C?line. Bye. He was too surprised to react right away. He just went to his work. Hello. Excuse me... Are you doing OK? Come here. C?line followed the plan without expecting anything special. Certainly not what was about to happen. Does Schubert interest you? Yes. I'm discovering him. But I want to know more. Why? Are you interested in him as well? Just between us... ...you don't know anything about him, don't you? That's right. I?m just starting... But I want to know more about him. Are you here for the first time? That's right. I figured some sports would be good for me. A girlfriend recommended it. I'm here to check it out. Do you come here often? Aren't you ashamed? Excuse me? I don't understand. I know everything. But... I don't know what you mean. To feel shame, one has to have a heart at least... ...and a bit of sensitivity. You're confusing me with someone else. - No, I'm not. And I'm not cheating on anyone. - You're wrong, I don't know you. Stop this game. Stop taking me for a fool. Are you getting paid to do this? Fine... It's true. I'm here for a reason. I don't know how much you know... ...but I don't think you're crazy. No one. It's not about the money. You're not doing this for money? You're doing it... ...for free? Then you disgust me even more. Just as much as them. I'm just here to help them. It was their only hope. They planned this for your own good. For my own good? Do you expect me to thank you? How lovely: I'm being surrounded by so many concerned people. I've never realized it myself. I know how you're feeling, but try to understand it. Understand, why? You are saying I don't have a heart, but have you got one? If I wouldn't have a heart, would I feel like this? Is humiliation proof of a heart or wounded pride? You're talking to me like you know me. If you only knew how much I love Judith. I love her like you never have. So you want her to be happy? - I've always wanted that. But now she's happy with someone else. But she loves you too much to leave you. Until now, she has suffered in order not to let you suffer. That's it. It's up to you to make her happy... ...if you love her, like you say you do. C?line wanted to tell Nicolas. All night Judith waited for news about Claudio. All night Nicolas waited for news about C?line. Hello, I'd like Nicolas Gimas' number please. Paris, Rue Fontaine. Are you sure? Not known? It was hopeless. - Hurry up, we have to go. She only had Nicolas? number in the memory of the stolen mobile phone. For three days Judith and Nicolas were left in the dark. Good morning. Good morning. Do you want to eat something? No, thanks. Do you want a drink? You're hurt, what's the matter? Sorry, did I hurt you? - No. Where are you going? You were right. About what? I have met someone. The cards. They were right. How's that? What you said that evening, that I would meet someone... I don't understand. I've met a woman. It was love at first sight, as they call it. I never thought it would happen to me. We've been away for three days. I'm sorry for being so upfront... ...but I don't want to lie to you. I know it sounds strange, but you understand me, right? Are you hurt badly? No... Well, yes, badly... I don't know. Even though the cards predicted it, I didn't expect it to happen so soon. Aren't you angry with me? No... It's useless... ...to get angry and fight each other. I'm happy... ...you're taking it this way. I'm going, I'm expected. I'll be back to pick up the rest. A few hours later C?line landed in Paris. she went straight to Nicolas. He was home. So she could tell him what happened. After that Nicolas called Judith and told her. After a few days she heard Claudio had returned to his family in Italy... ...and he was in a bad state. How did Judith and Nicolas feel when they saw each other again? What we did was wrong, wasn't it? - We didn't want to hurt anyone. Maybe it's a necessary evil. Don't get me wrong, but... ...as long as Claudio isn't happy, I can't be happy either. And that could take a very long time. How do you feel about it? I assume you don't find it a necessary evil. On the contrary... How I feel about it? I think it was a necessary good. How's that? Without it, I would never have met my husband. You mean poor Claudio is your husband? No, he's very happy now. That's what I think anyway. Now I understand about the kiss. You understand I don't want him to experience that again. Yes... But... ...I meant a quick kiss. Before a kiss has been given... ...no one knows whether it will be intimate or quick. I don't want you to have regrets. I want you to have enjoyed this evening. You have been so kind to listen to me. It was a pleasure. It feels like I owe you that kiss. I even think I'll enjoy giving you a kiss. Even when it's just an innocent little kiss, we must be aware of unforeseen consequences. The body is unpredictable. What do I have to do? We will kiss each other. And when it's done... ...we won't say anything. We will not say a word. Not even goodbye. We will say goodbye first. We will remain silent as not to betray our feelings. You don't know my last name. I don't know yours. We won't try to find out about them, nor try to meet each other. When the kiss is over... ...you'll leave... ...without a word or glance... ...or even a facial expression. We will keep our feelings to ourselves. Do you agree? - To be honest... ...I have to say I like these rules. Good. It's late. It has been a wonderful evening. The time has come to say goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye.
