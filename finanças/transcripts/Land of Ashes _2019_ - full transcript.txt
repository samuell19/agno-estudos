CENIZA NEGRA Elena. Get up. Shut up. Your face is all swollen. Stop doing stupid things. Do you want to end up in the hospital? I have a new word: kala kalakapun. Kupichi. Zorro. Zorro. Z-o-i. Zorro. Z-o-r-r-o. With a double "r". What was my mom like as a kid? She was beautiful. She was a beautiful little girl. What music did she like? She liked... guaracha. She loved guaracha. She danced guaracha. Entrechats? No, guaracha is a genre of music, like cha-cha-cha, for example. Not entrechats. Well, you need to take your hand. Come on, do it. And then, do like this. Go on, go on. Yes, but not so sticky. This way. - And you ? Do it. - Okay. Not so wet. Is it Fabián who taught you? - No, I learned by myself. - How ? With my hand. And who taught you how to do it with your hand? Mind your own business. I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to her. - So, have you ever kissed him ? - No. - Are you sure ? - When will you ? Why are you blushing ? - You're lying, right ? - No. You're blushing. Look. What happened ? I found it dead in the forest. It's a grass snake. Elena ! You can have it for 10,000. Too expensive. Don't listen to this crazy hag. You... nosy girl ! Mind your own business ! How much ? Look, you can make a bracelet out of it. - Nice. - Make me an offer. It's really delicious, right ? Give it back. - Not a chance. - Give it back ! Never touch my mom's stuff again. - Don't fuck with my business. - Stop killing snakes. Traitor. - Jerk. - Asshole. - Bitch. - Dumbass. Slut, stinky breath. Tadpole. Fool, slut, witch, whore. Big cunt, dickface. Dumbhead, flat ass, idiot, drunkard. - Skunk. - Moron. Stupid, silly face. Kalakapa. Lukpacti. Kulukupish. Ayacatum. Shake your belly. It's not fair, you're fatter than I am, so it's easier for you. No, I'm gifted. Let go. Loose. Up ! More, more. Elena. Grandpa is breathing funny again. Push him a little. Imagine a crab made of sky. It would be so white. Or a crab made of wood. Did you know that the strongest animal in the world is the lion? When they die, they stand up, they don't lie down. When we die, we can turn into a lot of things. Like what? Shadows, for example. In the desert, what will we eat? Elephants. Camels. I learned a new word. Chupalapika. Kupashi. Chumpampin. Kalakapa. Lapilinga. Lumusi. Chapani. My dad called. Tomorrow, he will send me money. Let's have a girls' night out. Let's do it. Listen to the frogs singing. I bet someone died. What are you listening to ? - What are you listening to ? - Rock. I don't like it. But my dad loves it, he has a lot of tapes. Which ones ? I don't know, but I can lend you some. Lend ? Give them to me. So greedy. What will I get in return ? What do you like ? Violeta ? No, Arab music. - So weird. - You're weird. No, listen. The goats ate everything. And the tiny one ? She is big now. Very big. - Is she eating enough ? - I gave her extra food. Look at your back hair, it's so long. See the tiny goat. She's so pretty and so small. Do you like it ? I love it. What do you like best, a long kiss or a short one, but with the tongue ? Both are good. You're right. Can I use your purse ? No. - Why not ? - You always get it dirty. When I go to the desert, I'll buy tons of purses and I won't lend you any. Do you like this place ? I love it. Don't tell Grandpa I brought you here. Not a word. Are we going soon ? I don't want to leave him alone. I'll be right back. Where are you going ? I'm coming. I'll be right back. Yesterday, I gave the goats extra food. And they ate everything. Isn't Elena with you ? She had a problem yesterday. A girl's thing. Okay, I will tell you, she got her period. Dirty liar. Eat, Grandpa. Yeah, but nothing too... He was joking, but that guy... He's too flashy about it. That's the way he is. - They recorded him. - He went crazy. Yeah, he looked like him. Dude, it's Fabián's chick. In any case, I wouldn't do that at school. - You wouldn't, but he did. - I don't think so. Anyway, he's in trouble. Where is Elena ? I'm sure she's at her place, don't worry. Elena ? Grandpa, look at me. Do like this. Inhale. - Do you feel better ? - Yes. Look what I brought you, from Elena. She wants you to fix it. Quickly. - Where is she ? - At her house. Listen. Grandpa, come eat. Eat a little. It tastes like goat food. What did you put in it ? Vinegar and onions. Don't you like it ? I do, but next time, let's cook together. Elena likes it. Eat a little. I'm putting a coin in so you can get one for me. Which one ? Which one do you want ? This one. No, the other one. - This one ? - No. This one is easy. If I catch it... My turn. Let's see, a little more... No... That one. - Go on, pick it up. - This one ? If I don't catch it, you buy me one. No. Grandpa, I'm home. Grandpa ? Hi sweetie, I found him alone in the forest. Thank you. Come, Grandpa. Grandpa. Thank you. Call me if you need anything. Where were you ? I got lost. It's okay, it's over now. Are we going by ourselves ? Stop being a pussy. Yeah, don't act like a baby. - I'm starving. - Hurry up, seriously. Why are you doing your hair ? We're not going to a party. Move ! Elena ? Why would she be here ? Because ! Elena ! You two, call her too. Hello! Is anyone there ? Should we split ? - Okay, you go this way. - Are you sure ? Yes. You should get dressed. We're late. Help me. As if you had no hand. We could play the song she liked. I don't like any song. Liar. This one is too large. Let me get you the blue one. Drunk hag. Grandpa, are you sleeping ? No, not yet. Tell me a story. A story... Once, when I was a little boy, I went down to the river for a swim. The current was strong, and it dragged me into a whirlpool. And I almost drowned. Almost. You almost died ? - You almost died ? - I almost died. What does death mean to you ? Well, dying is like sleeping... A deep sleep. You fall asleep forever. You never wake up. What color do you want ? White. Like a tiger. A tiger. One, two... Three ! Put it in. Now out. In. Out. Like that. Tap it. - It's good. - Is it ? Eat. I don't want to. I'm saving it for my goats. My little goats, they eat a lot. - Eat a little. - No. I'm saving it for my goats. - Eat. - I don't want to. Listen. What ? I can't hear anything. The goats are sick. I already told you, they don't exist. Don't you get it ? Bring me Elena. Eat. I don't want to. What's wrong ? Nothing. Tell me. I need to see Elena. Hi, tadpole. Hi, filthy cat. I went to the desert. How is it ? I rode a camel. Liar. Let me see. You've grown up. You know... Grandpa can't take it anymore. Yes, he's very tired. When he tells you he's hungry, cook him a snake soup. I don't want to be left alone. Don't worry. Close your eyes. I'm going to tell you a secret. Did you know that, every four months, snakes change color ? They wiggle and jiggle, their eyes turn white, they leave their old skin behind, and their new color appears. It looks like they are dying, but they are just changing color. As if they had thousands of lives. Grandpa? If I were a snake, I would change color, gold, silver, purple, pink, blue, and I would leave stars behind me wherever I go. Why aren't you sleeping ? I'm hungry. Tomorrow, we will eat. Elena will come and eat with me. So you should sleep. I dreamt that I was walking down the beach, and the sea was beautiful, glittering. And I kept walking and walking... Then, I heard a voice calling my name. I wanted to jump into the water but I woke up. So I thought: "Well!" "Later this morning, when I get up, I will go and swim." And I went into the sea. Here, Grandpa. Thank you. You look handsome today. So do you. To Dilara, little girl of fire.
