Young lady, I'd like to order a cake. I must have it in 24 hours. Here's my card. What kind of cake would you prefer? A $5 one. A birthday cake. Chocolate. All chocolate. I love chocolate. Would you like a little rose on top? No, make it a pansy. Very special order. - A birthday cake. - Thank you. Oh, girls! Everybody upstairs for Ms. Martin's gymnasium class. Fall in. That's fine, Jane, you're getting to look more like me everyday. Heaven help you! Oh, Nadine! Watch yourself. Dangerous curves ahead. Reach for a pickle instead of a pie. Mary, you gained two pounds since last week. Didn't I tell you to cut out the French pastry? Honestly, Ms. Martin, I haven't touched any sweet. I guess, I know French pastry when I see it. Now, you all better listen to me. Nowadays, the average maiden is extremely overladen with what's known as Adipose tissue. To retain that normal slant line in the region of your beltline has grown a national issue. Dieticians and physicians favor this and that but there's only one sure way of reducing that fat. Oh, girls, don't forget your sun pack on the roof this afternoon. Oh, Ms. Martin, the last few days.. - They have? - Yes. Why, the idea? I'll be up there this afternoon myself. Well, what do you think of that? How about a basketball game? Not today, girls. I've got to go over and see Professor Yolando. Oh, you mean that fortune teller? Say, he's not an ordinary fortune teller. Mr. Clark never makes a move without consulting Yolando. - Is he expensive? - Yes, but he's worth it. Could he tell me whether I was going to get married? He's a mystic not a magician. He promised me a husband and I am going over to get my promise. 'And now my friend, you must leave behind' 'all worldly thoughts.' 'As we prepare' 'to commune' with the unknown. Rinse yourself of the flesh and be purified. That you may be fit 'to converse' 'with the spirits.' 'Now, let us all' 'join hands' 'and form the mystic circle.' You feel good now. You will now hear three gentle raps. That was four. Merely a ghostly echo. Is there any departed spirit with whom you would like to communicate? I... I would like to talk to my Aunt Matilda of Minneapolis. Aunt Matilda.. Are you there? Aunt Matilda are you there? This is your Aunt Matilda talking. How are you, my dear little nephew? 'I am fine, aunt.' Are you happy.. Where you are? 'Yes.' 'The weather is fine' 'here in Minneapolis' 'considering the tough winter we've had.' Aunt Matilda.. In Minneapolis? Matilda, why do you speak of being in Minneapolis? I am in heaven but there is a Minneapolis in heaven just as there is a St. Paul. But don't mix up Minneapolis with St. Paul. The spirit cannot linger. Wait a minute, Aunt Matilda. When can I hear your voice again? 'How is Friday' 'at 8:30 for you?' 8:30? 'Yes.' 'At 7:30' 'we have a harp rehearsal.' A 8:30? Fine. It's a date, I'll meet you here. Aunt Matilda now signing off until Friday at 8:30. What was that? We are now on a higher plane. The spirits mocked our approach by the tinkle of bells. Bells! Oh, the bells. Bells, bells. 'Stop! Stop!' 'A spirit will suffer' 'if this continues.' I feel a spirit approaching. Do you think it might be my Harold? I'll enquire. What is your name? 'This is Harold talking.' Harold talking? Why, Harold was my dog. 'There is a conflict' 'between the human and animal spirits.' 'But the animal spirits will triumph.' Oh, make him bark again. 'Harold, your mistress wants you' 'to bark for her.' Harold, what are they feeding you? 'Liver. Liver' That is enough. The spirit has passed on. 'The table will now' 'slowly rise.' The table will now lower. Want me to give you a big.. Crazy. Sometimes, the spirits are perverse. The table will now lower. - Oh! - It's still going up! This table don't hear very well. The spirit should hear even through walls of stone unless they're deaf! Lower! Oh, my toe. Shh.. 'The seance, my friends' has come to an end. 'Oh, Professor.' I have a very confidential question to ask you. I know. You want to ask me about... - Love. - Of course. You're a woman who is much sought after. I maybe sought after, but nobody ever finds me. Ah, that is because you are one of those noble souls who must wait patiently. Oh, professor, can't you speed it up? If I could find my ideal man I'd give $200. Ah! I see the light. The man of your dreams will come to you. Oh, what does he look like? I see him clearly. He wears a white carnation. 'Oh, I love carnations.' 'Pale and somewhat anemic.' That's alright. I'll build him up. He has big, black eyes that pop right out of his head. If you think, they're popping out now wait until I get hold of him. 'And this one won't get away!' 'Have no fear!' At 11 o' clock.. He will come to your place. - At 11 o' clock? - Hmm. Oh, I must hurry. I'll be waiting with open arms. What am I gonna do with you? You almost ruined the seance. Now, you're going up to Martin's. - No, I won't. - What? Listen, I have carried out your predictions and I've never complained. But when you start bringing women into it.. That sex! You'll do as you're told or I'll kill you. Go ahead and kill me. See if I care. What's my life worth anyhow? Yesterday, I tried to kill myself. I walked in front of a taxi cab and dared the taxi to run over me. But the taxi wouldn't do it, you know why? It was yellow. Well, I am not yellow. No, I won't go! Every time that fool gets excited, he must sing. You'll go, you hear? No, it's not honest. Would Washington go? No. Would Lincoln go? Would Lindbergh go? Lindbergh wouldn't go! Lindbergh wouldn't go! But after all, I am not Lindbergh. Oh, 11 o'clock! Well, that's enough today, girls! Go on! All back to work! Hurry up. Get out! All of you, all of you. Hurry, hurry, hurry! 'Come in.' Oh, my gigolo! Pardon me, are you Ms. Martin the physical torturess? Yes, I'm Helen Martin but you may call me Helen. I'm Eddie Simpson, you may call me Tuesday. Oh, come back, darling! All my life I've been waiting for this moment. Well, you've had your moment. Goodbye. Oh, but you don't understand. You're the man I've been waiting for. Where have you been all these years? Oh, it's a long story. But first tell me who is that man? That's our president. Hmm, how Hoover has changed. No, that's President Clark of the bakery. Oh, but darling, come, sit down. Oh, come to my arms. No, no, no, no, no! But why are you singing? Are you ready? Oh, uh, not just now, judge. Would you mind waiting in there, please? Judge? Why, what's the judge for? - He's gonna marry us. - Oh, no! - We're gonna be married! - Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, don't be silly. We were made for each other. Oh, no. You're far above me! How can you say that? Our marriage was arranged in heaven. Well, that's where I'll marry you! Oh, I don't know why I should love you. You're no Ronald Colman. Say, you're not Marlene Dietrich yourself. Oh, Dietrich's got nothing I haven't got. Oh, that's good. Oh, baby you're the key to my ignition. Well, then you better start your engine and keep moving. Oh, you don't understand. Marriage is a science. When two fine physical specimens like us get married. I know, then all our children will be acrobats. Oh, let me explain. - Here, feel my muscles. - Mm. Now, compare it with yours. It's about even. Now, let me see, how heavy you are. - Now, you lift me. - Oh, no. I don't like this kind of a game. Let's play hide and seek. I'll hide first. Oh, this is science. You must lift me. Oh, why don't you get a fella your size? Life me! Oh, no, no, no. Oh, what brute strength. Oh, tell me something about yourself and your family. What were your parent's names? Papa and mama. Oh, I mean, where do you come from? What is your pedigree? Listen, please. You don't wanna marry me. All my people came from the hospital. My father died two years before I was born. My grandfather passed away when he was still a baby. And my mother was so sick she was never allowed to marry. When I was three years old, I had measles. And you know what happened? It was fatal. And by the way, I'm insane. Boogie-boogie-boogie-boggie. Oh, you're just the man! All my life, I've been wanting to work on a thing like you. - A thing like me? - Yes. A thing like you. Come in here. - I'll build you up. - I don't wanna be built up. I'll build you up and how I'll build you up. Here, now take this medicine ball. This will do you good. Oh, you can't swallow a thing like that. - Oh, throw it. - To you? Come on. Atta boy! Boy! You were better than I thought you were. Oh, boy, this will build you up. Now, come on. Up! Atta boy! Yeah. - Now, isn't that nice? - Yes. But what part of me will it build up? Well, your back, your shoulders and your back! - You want it stronger? - Well, I don't know. Wait a minute. That's no good. Oh! Isn't that romantic? I can see us together in the moonlight riding way off into the desert. Your horse going faster and faster.. Take me off. I don't like it. Oh, that's what I call love. - Take it off. - Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I smell something burning. It's me! Take me off! I'd kill the horse. - Take me off! - Wait a minute, will you? - Stop! Will you stop it? - There. Stop it. Oh! Oh! That's the worst thing I ever felt. Oh, it's, oh, it's broken bottles. Oh, it's pins and needles. You stabbed me. Oh, don't be worried. Oh, wait a minute. I think I'm going to keel over. Oh, you poor boy! Oh, no circulation. A good massage is what you need. What're you gonna do now? I'm gonna give you a good massage. I don't wanna.. I don't... You don't realize how happy I am to be able to do something for you that's gonna do you so much good. How about me? Why you can't ask me, dear? Boy, by God you've got two left legs. I was all together before I got on that horse. Well, don't worry. I'll make it right. Oh, what're you doing? You crip.. What are you... doing that for? Do you think sweetheart that you could ever learn to love me? I'm dying and she asks me riddles! Now! This may seem unnecessary, dear but it's very, very necessary. - Necessary for whom? - For you, dear. This will make you robust! Did you say robust or robot? This is good for your diaphragm. Nothing wrong with my frying pan. Now, I've got to unravel you. Oh, at last I meet the man of my dreams. Face to face. Oh, how often.. Do you feel better, darling? Yeah, pretty soon I won't feel anything at all. Oh! You think you could marry me now? Oh, just keep on hitting me till I'm in the mood. Oh, if you only knew what I feel for you. There isn't any sacrifice I wouldn't make for you. I would.. I'd give you everything. - Oh! - Oh! Come back here. I haven't finished with you yet. 'Oh, I love you so..' Come on. Broken bottles. Oh! He comes, Mr. Clark. He comes. Who comes? A man who will build your business. He walks into your office. The clock strikes 12:00. 'Engage him at once' 'and at any cost.' 'Do all he tells you.' I don't know how to thank you, professor. Don't thank me. It is fate. Put 200 bucks on Clark's bill. How do we stand with the old boy? I've got him eating out of my hand. What do we do? The richest sucker in town and you ask me what we do. What do you suppose I've been planning for? A lot of cash around there. One of us ought to be there to protect it. Joe, at 12 o' clock today you go to Clark's office get the job and leave the rest to me. I get you, chief. Yu-hoo! Busy? Hello, baby! Hello, Steve. Gee, I'm glad you came in. Do you suppose anyone would see if I would've kiss you? I'll close my eyes for one. - Is father here? - Well, no. He went to Yolando's. Come on into my office. - Did you tell father about us? - I did. What did he say? Well, he asked me if I could support you. I told him I could start you on bread and milk, the same as he did. Well, if you can't, all he's got to do is raise your salary until you can. And if he doesn't we'll take a nice little cottage back at the gasworks. I might have to give up smoking but I wouldn't mind that. And I'd be waiting at the gate for you. With little Joan baby Clark. And I'd say, "Steve where'd you been all night?" Hello, dad. I'm just dropping in on your future son-in-law. Hey, hey, young lady. You get out. Let this young man work. I just wanted to tell you, I'm expecting a new efficiency expert who's going to do wonders for this business. Where's he coming from? From heaven. What time is it? Almost 12 o'clock. 12 o'clock. 12 o'clock. Come back! I'll look after you! - What? - Come back! I'll look after you! Well, here I go. Look after me. Oh, come back here. 'Don't leave me now that I've made you so healthy.' Thanks very much but I've got date with an undertaker. You're here. You can see for yourself. Where did you come from? Out of the everywhere into the here. It's a miracle! I feel the same way about it, Mr. Clark. Ah, you know me! - I saw your picture. - Where? Up there! - Up there? - Yes. Up there. Not down there? I haven't been down there yet. This is the happiest day of my life, Mr.. Simpson. Eddie Simpson. I can't really believe you're here. I'm here! Pinch me. See? If it was a dream, you'd wake up, wouldn't you? Yes, yes. - Let's get down to business. - Alright. If you want the position of efficiency expert here I'm ready to pay you $15,000 a year. 15,000? Don't get mad! 20,000. 20,000? 25,000. - Make it 9. - That's economy for you. Now, then... what do you make? I draw 50,000. 50,000? From now on, you get 30. I can't live on 30. So, you can't live. What difference does it make? I tell you, Mr. Clark, it's up to you. I've cut mine down to 9,000. Be a man and cut yours. I'll take 30. I'll take 8. I'll take 25. That's the spirit. I'll take 7. - Cut mine to 20. - Make it 15. - No! 15, no. - Make it 15. You can eat all the crullers you want here. You can take the bread home. Well, make it 15. I mean, now-now make it 15. Make it 15, 15? - Fifteen? - Well. I'll take 15. That's the boy. Now, what do you take? - I'll take 20. - Oh, oh, but... We can't keep it up all day. This is a business. You got to go on. For goodness sakes. Now, if I could only cut down on my relatives. - You've got relatives? - Have I got relatives? Wait, under that? Here is the list I have to send checks to every week. I'd like to get rid of half of them. Half of them? But you kept the wrong half. Alright. I can fix that too. Ask me anything. What's the capital of United States? Half of what it was last year. Boy, you know, this is a great day's work. I'm all in. Whatever you do, don't wear yourself out. I can't help myself. I'm just a bundle of nerves. When I get going.. Quack-quack-quack. I can't keep still. Say, that's pretty good. It should be good. I've been practicing it all my life. And before I get through, Mr. Clark let me tell you something, I'm gonna have every man woman and child in this bakery quacking all day long. Uh, say, will you teach me too? Look, have you got a lower lip? Put it under your upper. Look. No, no, look. Did you ever hear one duck paging another duck? Look. I'll tell you what to do, you practice here a while while I go outside and find myself an office. - Alright? - Yes. Do you mind if I use this office? Why, no. Go right ahead. Gee, it's swell. Yes, it has a lot of nice furniture in it. Oh, it has more than that. 'What do you like about it?' Oh.. Something. Oh, if you have some work to do, I'll get out. No, no, no. I want nothing moved out of this office. I want it exactly.. As it is. I've never seen you around here before. I work here. I'm an efficiency expert. - Since when? - Oh, since.. Well, the crash was in 1930 and my aunt uh, wait, uh about five minutes. - Who engaged you? - Clark. - Do you know him? - Yes, pretty well. Say, how would you like to be my secretary? You know, I can fix it with Clark. - You can? - Oh, yes! Clark and I, we're like this. That is I'm like this. He's practicing. I'll tell ya, let me run over to Clark and ask him if he'd put you, wait for me. Oh, no. I'll ask him myself at dinner. You have a date with him for dinner? It isn't necessary to have a date with your father. Oh, give me strength. Listen, I.. ..I want to apologize. I, you know, when I first came.. I will, you know, you were.. I could never, well.. Then it.. Well, you see? It's perfectly clear. It is? Well, then explain it to me. Well, it goes like this. Here I was sitting in the office. Hello. Hello? We have Ms. Clark? Yeah, she's here. Who? Ms. Martin. - Hello? - Joan. Can you come up for your exercises now? I couldn't leave now. No, I can't, Helen. I wouldn't do it for anything. Oh, break that luncheon date with Steve. You wouldn't if you knew him. 'I fell for him, the moment I laid eyes on him.' Yes, some other time. But not now. Goodbye. Mr. Clark calling Mr. Simpson. Mr. Clark calling Mr. Simpson. 'Mr. Clark calling Mr. Simpson.' I'd like to stay but Mr. Clark is calling Mr. Simpson. Oh! Oh! Oh! I'm in love. I'm in love. I had never wanted to fall, but I'm in love. Whoopie! Is he crazy? 'Look, I've got it.' - I got it. - What? That's fine. Now, remind me tonight. - I'll give you some homework. - Homework? Sure. You don't wanna practice on the first time. That's right. Have you got anything else to suggest? Nothing, but lunch. I never let anything interfere with my lunch except my indigestion. You've got indigestion? - Last year I had an operation... - You had an operation? I'm gonna show you an operation, my dear man. Fine. I get everything set and you crap it. What could I do? I get there and they wouldn't even take my name in. They tell me Clark just got himself an efficiency expert. - What's the name of this guy? - I don't know. Do you know your own name? Now, I got to go over to Clark and straighten the whole thing out. Well, what do you want me do now? - Have you got a gun? - Yeah. Then go shoot yourself. No, no, no, no without jelly. The unicorns without jelly. No, we tried them with jelly, but they become very sticky. The donuts without and then, uh, yes. Hello, hello, don't bother. No, no, I couldn't do it. Hello.. You girls better leave. There's gonna be language used here that you shouldn't hear for five or six years. Thank you. You're welcome. So, you are the efficiency expert. Yes, if you're a fortune teller, I'm an efficiency expert. Even if you're not a fortune teller I'm still an efficiency expert. Trying to double-cross me, eh? - What do you mean double-cros... - You know how you got the job? I told Clark I was sending him an efficiency expert. I don't care how I got it, I'm gonna keep it. Certainly, you're gonna keep it. Then you don't mind my resigning from you? - Resigning? - Yes. I sent you a letter in the mail today. You'll get it tomorrow. Of course, there's two cents due on it but then you owe me a week's salary. - So, we'd be even. - You rat! Mr. Rat to you! If I use my power, how long do you think you'll be here? Listen, you couldn't do that. Give me a chance. This means my career. Your career is to follow up my orders. The only way to get me out of here is to kill me! That can be arranged. 'Say, there's an idea.' I wonder where I can get some whiskers. Say, you know that French guy whose picture we saw in the paper this morning? - What French guy? - That psychic. - Ledoux? - Yeah. Well, he's waiting out in the hall to see you. - To see me? - Yeah. Oh, boy! We're getting up in the world. I can learn a lot from that bird. - He's no phoney. - No? No, he's known all over the world. - Show him in. - Fine. Ah! Monsieur,professor. I am so happy to meet you. Mwah! Mwah! Mwah! I have looked forward to this moment. I am honored by your visit, professor. I am sure you will never forget it. Look, I would like to be alone with you. Could you please send away these monkeys? I want for both of us to commune with the spirits. Professor, what is the latest method of reading people's thoughts? There's only one method. Madam psychosis.. 'What?' I will show.. You still use this? Passe! Passe! - Why, that cost a fortune. - Ah! it's worthless. Ha.. You still read the palm! The palm, you read? Such won't stop. Oh, professor, this is nothing at all. Nothing at all! This is nothing! Ha, what is the modern way? Mm, come here, I will show you. Come with me. Now, you see? Lie down. Lie down! First, I put you in a receptive mood. Yes? That hurts! Ah, but only for the first half hour. Now, please show me your Adam's apple. Your Adam's apple. I see. Now. You're choking me. Ah! But it is the latest French method. Obviously, but it is painful. Ah, but it will feel so good when I stop. And now, you repeat after me. Inki-pinki-powli-boo. Inki-pinki-powli-boo. That's good. Now, we join hands.. So I may read your soul. What-what's the matter, professor? I am going in a trance. Yolando.. I feel you're an honest man. I feel it in your bones, you're an honest man. You only take things beginning with an 'A' like "A thousand dollars A diamond bracelet, A pearl necklace." Why, professor, such a thing never comes to my mind. Does not come to your mind, but it comes to your hand. - Yolando... - Why, professor.. Yolando.. I see a young boy who wishes to go on the honest path. But you will not let him go. You will not let him go on the path. And why will you not let this boy go, I do not know. But there's something else I want to talk to you about. That professor, and this is this. This boy has big eyes and a skinny neck. 'He's a sweet boy and the spirits are crazy for him.' They follow him around and if you do him harm, the spirits will fix you good. And I don't mean maybe. Oo-la-la. He will become, what you say in America, a hoodoo. Yes, he is hoodoo for you. A hoodoo? Now I see the number '13.' Thirteen is my lucky number. Not this time, it is your lucky number. Thirteen, 12 jury men and a judge. - No, no, no. - Yes, yes. Who's seeing this, you or me? Lay down, I give you liver. - Liver? - Liver to me. Now, I see you sitting nicely in a chair. - Ask me what kind of a chair. - What kind of a chair? A chair, underneath is electricity and steam is coming out of your head. You are having a hard time, Yolando. - No, no. - Yes, yes. Stop it! Stop it! I'll let the boy go. - You let him go? - Yes. - You let the boy go? - Yes. Mon ami! You always sing when you talk, professor? Your soul, eh? I'll tear your liver out, you little rat! Oh, please, professor... Oh, I take things that being with an 'A.' How would you like to have 'A' sock on the gum? Listen, why don't you give me a chance? I did it only because I wanted to go straight. Yeah, you'll go straight to the cemetery. - What is this? - I'll take care of him. But Clark's outside. Oh, he is. Listen, you hit me and I'm gonna tell Clark all about your fake predictions. - Oh, wouldn't dare... - I wouldn't, eh? Mr. Clark! Mr. Clark! Why, Eddie, I didn't expect to find you here. - I'm ready for your reading. - You don't have to bother. I found out that you had an appointment with the professor and I took the reading for you. Boy, you got an efficiency expert. You know, Joan, you're getting prettier everyday. - How do you do it? - Well, most of it is makeup. But some it is being in love. Must be the make up. Look at me. I'm in love right up to my neck and believe me, that's pretty far up. - Is he cute? - "Is he cute?" Say, when he looks at you, your heart goes, hot ziggetty.. Say, you must be in love with Steve too. With Steve? Don't make me laugh. Oh, yeah? What's the matter with Steve? Oh, Steve is alright, but he hasn't got anything that makes your heart go hot ziggetty.. - He hasn't? - No. Then why does my heart go.. When I see him? Does you heart go when you see him? On the level, Joan, you do love him, don't you? Love him? The stars that shine and as your sky... Ahh, hold everything. You love him, "As your sky," as you were. Well, no accounting for case, is there? Well, tell me about your great moment. What's he look like? Oh, it's just an ordinary face nothing to write home about, but I like it. - Tall? - No. He only comes up to about there. Does he show any signs of being in love? Well, when he see me, he runs away. Does that mean anything? Are you sure you're in love with him? Sure, I'm sure, I can't sleep, I can't eat. I see his face in front of me all the time in the beach too, in the asparagus even in the spinach. Joan, I keep kissing the spinach and when you kiss spinach, you're in love. Maybe I ought to give Steve back his ring. Yeah, maybe I ought to break your arm. Steve is alright, he's a nice young fellow handsome and got a lot of money, but no spinach. Don't you think a marriage could be happy without spinach? I'm afraid not. Don't you think that sometimes as two people are good friends, they may develop some spinach? Oh, Joan, that's only artificial spinach. There's no vitaphones I mean-I mean vitamins in it. You might as well eat broccoli. What do you think I ought to do? Give Steve up? Certainly, not. Marry the guy. You can always get your spinach on the outside. If you know what I mean, yeah, know what I mean. This is our key room and that's the cake shop. You know how many girls work here? About half. Well, you're the efficiency expert, fix it. - Alright. - I'm going to go get a bite. - I don't like your makeup. - I like it. Well, that settles that. - May I look at you? - I don't see why you shouldn't. Thank you. You know it's nice to see a girl without too makeup on. - I bet you don't drink. - I don't. - Do you smoke? - No. - Do you stay out late nights? - Never. My, you're a nice girl. Say, I'd like to ask you something. - Uh-huh. - Do you drink? - No. - Do you smoke? - No. - You stay out late night? - Never! - You're a nice girl too. Ah-ha-ha-ha! Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. My dear, lady, I know what you're trying to do. You're trying to dunk. Wait a minute, but that's not dunking. That's bathing. 'Uh, wa-wait a minute, will you let me tell you one more thing.' Look, always keep your finger out like this in dunking. See? It's acts a safety guard. Otherwise, you'll have to dunk right up to the elbow. Well, you see? My goodness. Well, Eddie, how're you getting along? Sit down. Lady Godunka, this is Mr. Clark. - Mr. Clark, lady Godunka. - How do you do? - I'm a little bit disappointed. - Why? This place should do a much a bigger business. We should. We serve the finest food in town. And we have the most beautiful girls in the world. Not enough, nowadays, Mr. Clark people want more than food and good looking girls. They want to laugh, they want to be happy they want to sing, they want entertainment. Mr. Clark, in less than no time I can make this place the talk of the town. And when I say I can make this place the talk of the town I mean, make it exactly.. 'Just can't wait to hear him. They say he's wonderful.' Wait until your hear him. He's great! 'I hope so.' Look! Look, everybody! The first thing, you know, he'll think you love him. Daddy is that polite? Is that the kind of the letter to write in Eddie Simpson's office? It's the kind of the letter I'm going to leave on Steve's desk. - You're very happy, aren't you? - Why shouldn't I be? You're announcing our engagement tonight. But Steve doesn't know that. - You haven't told him. - Certainly, not! I want to keep it as a surprise. I'd love to see the expression on his face when he finds it out. - Great boy Steve! - He's the finest boy on Earth. - And I'm wild about him. - Yes, I can see you are. Will you stop reading Steve's mail? Mail? Mush! Oh. Hello, Eddie. How's the efficiency expert? Well, I.. I don't know what I can tell you. What's on your mind? Joan, I.. I'd like to ask you a question. Yes? Do you think that people should marry young? Well, I'm no Beatrice Fairfax, but I say yes if they loved each other. Oh, these two love each other that is, I know the girl loves the boy and.. I'm just crazy about the girl, I mean... Ah! You love the girl? Love her? Say I'm cuckoo about her. And, you know, at night when I go to sleep, I.. I just can't sleep. I.. I-I get trouble with in-insunami insunambula, insambulance or something. You think, you think I'll ever get over it? Why, yes. You will when you get married. - Married? - Yes, married. - Did you say married? - 'Yes.' She said married. M-A-double R-I.. What happened to the desk? - Efficiency. Great, isn't it? - Great what? Well, don't you know how people come to your office sit on the corner of your desk. No corner, can't sit can't sit, can't take up your time. Great, isn't it? Why can't I think of these things? - What am I here for? - That's right. Now I told her not to leave this note around. I read it. Great girl, Joan. I'm kind of proud of her. Let's get to work. Say, I'm proud of you for having her. - Eddie? - Mm-hm. - Can you keep a secret? - Mm-hm. - I got little surprise for you. - Yeah? I'm going to announce the engagement tonight. - Announce the engagement? - Yes. But don't tell anybody. I want it as a surprise. In fact, I intended keeping it even from you. Is it okay with Joan? Sure, it's okay. I asked her. And she said yes? Yes. And she kissed me. - She kissed you? - Yes. - That's the least I can do. - Don't be silly, Eddie. She kissed him. She loves me. Oh, my heart. She loves me. She loves me not. She loves me. She loves me not. She loves me. She loves me. Ah, prosperity at last. - That's the bonus money. - The bonus money? Well, you see, once a year, I distribute $25,000 amongst the best workers of each department. Aren't you gonna put the money in safe? Count it and take it downstairs. Four thousand, 5000. What's the safe for? Well, Michael's gonna break it up in the right amounts. Four thousand 17,000. It's okay. Okay? Why don't you count the rest of it? See, if it's alright up to 17,000 you don't have to worry about the rest. Alright, take it downstairs. Yes, sir. - How do you do, Mr. Clark? - Hello, professor. You certainly are. Everything I do is for the best, Mr. Clark. Funny, every time he gets excited, he sings. What a peculiar habit? Hello. Yes. 'No. Take it upstairs.' - You know Mr. Simpson? - Of course. Of course. Of course. Professor, I'd like to have you give a reading before my guests at the party tonight. I'd be honored. You know we try to get Professor Ledoux the famous French mystic. But he suddenly went out of business he lost his whiskers. I'll expect you there, professor. I'll be there. And I may have a message for you. Thanks, a thousand times. Eddie? There's a great man. As honest as the day is long. Mm-hm. The days are getting shorter and shorter. What's up, boss? There's a lot of cash in the safe up in Clark's office and Eddie has the combination on a yellow strip of paper. - Will be give it to us? - He either gives it to you. Or you take it away from him, see? Come on. Wait.. What are you doing here? 'Just a social call, that's all.' Mm. I'll.. No, you don't. I just wanted to order some tea. I thought maybe you'd like some coffee. Yolanda wants the combination of that safe. And we get it from you dead or alive. Dead or alive? Can I choose? Yeah, you can choose. Give it to us and you're alive. If you're dead, we take it away from you. Well, that's a very attractive proposition. I'd like to think it over, gentleman. Could you come back in a couple of years? Stop wise cracking, we mean business. Well then I.. I guess I better give it to you. 'Now, you're talking. Turn it over.' Alright. He thinks I'm gonna work Sunday, he's crazy. - Forth floor. - Going down. He couldn't have gone very far. Well, let's take a peek downstairs. Main floor. Here, I'm not through with that.

What's the matter with you? - Give me that towel. - 'No, no.' - Give me that towel. - 'No, oh, I'm ruined.' That's right, girls, don't be afraid to use a little soap. It won't do any of you any harm. Somebody give me a towel for the love of Lord. Give me a tow.. A Turkish towel. Please. Why do you want a Turkish towel for? You'll never know. Go on and take your shower. Oh! Oh! 'If I don't get a towel, I'll be the funniest guy' 'Come in. Help! Help!' - What's the matter with you? - I'm burning. - I'll come in inside. - No, you won't. No, you won't. I'd rather burn.

What have you in that bag? Now, who are you? Well, Eddie Simpson, Mr. Clark's right hand. - Oh. - And left. I'm sorry, but at a party like this we have to watch any suspicious looking character. Suspicious looking? Whoa! Yes, you've met my girl, that's sufficient for me. Hey, Mr. Clark, I wanna talk to you about a matter of great importance. Yes, not now, Eddie. Not now. I'm too busy. I'm too busy. No, you don't understand. Oh. Pardon me. Have you seen Eddie Simpson? Eddie? Why, yes. He was here a few minutes ago. - Oh, he was? - Yes. Boss, I tried to tell you before I had something very important take up with you. Can't it wait until morning? It maybe too late. Too late. Ah, Mr. Simpson. Why? Did you see bumps on the young man's head? Come, my friend, I want to give you a reading. - But, Mr. Clark. - Go ahead. The professor will give you a great kick. Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of. - Take that satchel. - There's nothing in there. Open it. - What's that? - Why, that, that's my lunch. You know, I've been to these parties before. Well, I'll be hanged. - Is that a prediction? - Where's the money? In a place where you'll never get it. You'll never get out of this place alive. - Wait... - Gentlemen. The future has great things in store for you. 'Mr. Clark requests the presence of everybody in the gala.' We're coming. Meet me at the gates. After you. Oh, no. After you. Still after me, huh? Joan, may I have this dance? Why, certainly yes. Excuse me. Hold me closer, Eddie. - Even closer? - Yes. Isn't the music beautiful? Music? Oh, yes. There is music, isn't there? - Where are you going? - Oh, there's such a crowd here. I'm suffocating. Would you like to take a little walk? Maybe I'll say something. Pardon me. Have you got your revolver in your pocket? Joan.. This is the greatest night in my life. It's a wonderful night for me too, Eddie. - You mean that? - Of course, I do. Ooh. - Where are you going? - Look. But, Eddie... Come, gather around, everybody. Where? Where is Mr. Simpson? Eddie? - Where is my right hand? - Right here, at our left. My friends, I want to introduce to you a young man you all know. A young man who has shown great promise and ability. 'A young man, whom I shall be glad' 'to count as a member of my family.' It gives me great pleasure to announce the engagement of my daughter Joan... Mr. Clark, you've been robbed! The safe is wide open, and thee bonus money is gone. What?! Eddie, weren't you going to take care of that? I'll explain it to you later. Did you put the money in the safe? - I did. - Well, where is it? I can't tell you now. 'But we were the only ones who had the combination.' 'What became of the money?' But I'm telling you, I can't tell you now. I'll make him tell. - Come on out. - Well, listen to me. Come clean now. - Where's the dough? - The dough is in the bread. Don't get funny. - Where's the dough? - I tell you, it's in the bread. I'll have to give him the old hypnotism. - You get out. - Sure. Stand against that wall. - Now, look me in the eye. - Which one? Concentrate. Concentrate. Not so stiff. Relax. Relax. Get up. - Now, follow me. - Where're you going? Quiet. Watch this finger. Make a motion. I move, we adjourned. Close your eyes. You're asleep. - Have I got my pajamas on? - Sleep. Shhh. - Where're you going? - I'm walking in my sleep. Stare at me. Keep staring at me. Things are going round and round. You're getting dizzy. Everything swims. - Swim! Swim! - I'm tired swimming. Do you mind if I float a little bit? Stare at me. Stare at me. 'Keep staring at me.' 'Don't.' Don't. Don't... stare at me. Oh, so you're the fellow that was going to.. - 'Have you got it, Eddie?' - 'Yeah.' - 'Good.' - Listen, Mr. Clark.. Well? Now will you tell me? I've been trying to tell you all evening. I was afraid we were gonna be robbed. So I baked the money in the bread. Here. Well, where is it? That's funny. - I guess, the joke's on me. - Joke? I must have taken the wrong loaf. Why.. You don't think.. Eddie, I like you. I trusted you. I looked in you as a member of my own family. Joan. Steve. You don't believe.. Listen. You people who know me. You don't believe I'm a crook? I'm sorry. - Come on. - Why, listen. Somebody. 'Somebody listen to me.' What have you done to Eddie? I tell you, officer, you're makin' a big mistake. Oh, sure. Get in. Wait a minute! - Wait a minute! - What is it? I can tell you plenty about that guy. - You can? - Yes. Hop in. Come and tell the sergeant. The bakery. Quick. Stop the car. Stop the car. - Stop it. - What's the matter? My hat blew off. Do you mind if I go and get it? Wise guy. You go and get it? You might forget to come back. You stay here, and I'll go and get it. Alright. Oh, that was great, Eddie. Now we've got to get to that bakery. Did you really bake the money in the bread? - I did. Honestly, I did. - Why? - Yolando is a crook. - Yolando? Yes, he was after the money so I took it out of the safe and had it changed to 25 $1000 bills. How could you bake all that money in one loaf of bread? It was only this much to it. - Oh, look out! - Oh, please! Eddie, we simply got to find it. - Where is it? - I know where it is? It's in the stock room. Come with me. - Where're the lights? - 'Here they are.' Now hurry up, and find the money. Find the money. That's almost impossible. Now, hurry, Eddie. We've got to find it. - We've got to find it. - Sure. Find it. It's like looking for a haystack in the needle. What am I gonna do? Say, my mother said I should pick this one? I suppose you think I can open it up and find.. It's the money! I've got to take it right back to Mr. Clark. 'Give me that money.' - Get it. - Throw it! Throw it! Let me alone! - Hurry up! - Alright. Go on, run! Don't stop. Look, over here. You leave him alone now! Don't you.. Eddie! Eddie, give it to 'em. I'll give to them, alright. Here, take it. Give it to 'em. Give 'em anything they want. - Take that from him. - Come on, Helen. Give it to me. - Why, the money's gone! - I bet it's him! Oh, I'm glad you gave it to them. You mean, the bread? Here's the money. Open the door, or I'll break it in! - Phone Mr. Clark. Go ahead. - Oh, Clark. Open the door, do you hear? Hello. Mr. Clark, this is Helen Martin. Eddie and I are in the bakery. We've got the money. 'Why don't you save yourself some trouble and open the door?' 'I want to be nice to you, Eddie.' - 'Give me that dough.' - No. The money doesn't belong to me. It's Mr. Clark's. 'That sucker.' - And I won't do it. - 'You all won't, eh? Come on!' Come on, Helen! - Helen, come on! - Get him! - Clark's Bakery. Fast. - Alright, captain. Let's go. Come on! Why don't you pick on somebody your size? Hey, traitor! - I won't have you do.. - Hey, let go of my hair. I'll sock your mouth numb. I will. Ah! Oh! Don't you do that to me. 'Well, what do you mean?' 'Well, you don't know who you're doing this to rough..' - You think I can't.. - Let go! Ah! You get away from me! Well, search a lady. The window, Helen! Leave him alone! Leave him alone, I tell you. Help yourself. I'll be alright? You're going to see why. - Knock yourself, Helen! - Leave that man alone. Why don't you pick on somebody your size? - 'That's what I'm saying!' - The coat! The coat! The coat's full.. The coat! It's your own coat! - Eddie! - Aah! This's your coat. 'Make up your mind, you don't leave this' 'not until I get that money.' - 'But I haven't got it.' - 'Who has?' - 'I have it.' - 'Oh, don't believe her.' 'Don't believe her, professor.' 'She's just saying that to protect me.' Really. - Ah! - Oh! Double crosser. - So long, Eddie. - Wait a minute. - Wait a minute. - Get off my back. Oh! You senseless brute. - You do not hurt somebody.. - Let go of me! 'Let go, I say! Let go!' - There's your man. - Mr. Clark. - Why, I'm a sucker. - I got your hat. Get 'em outta here. Get 'em out. All of them. - Come on. - Let's go. - Hurry up. Get 'em out. - Let's go. Mr. Clark.. Here's your money. - Eddie.. - Listen, everybody. Three cheers for Eddie Simpson. - Hip-hip-hooray! - Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! I'm terribly sorry. Just give me a chance to prove it. You want to do something for me? Anything. Mr. Clark.. I've just discovered that I'm in love.. Really in love with Helen Martin. Congratulations. I want you to break the news gently to Joan. Tell her I can't marry her. I hope she doesn't take it too hard. Tell her.. Tell her, it's life. Helen.. I've got a surprise for you. - Will you marry me? - I've got a surprise for you. Ooh! You take this man to be your lawful wedded husband? - Yes, yes! - Hmm.
