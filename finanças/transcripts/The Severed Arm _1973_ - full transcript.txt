(dark electronic music) (door creaks) (footsteps clack) (saw scrapes) (ominous tones) (suspenseful music) (knocks) - [Man On Phone] I don't know. (knocks) - Hello, special delivery package. Sign here, please. That's very good, that'll do it. Thank you. - Yeah. Mm-hm. Yeah, so did I, it was a great evening. I'm opening a package. Christmas is early, I guess. What time should I come over? Yeah, you know it. (ominous music) Dr. Sanders, please. Jeff Ashton. Tell him it's urgent. (peaceful orchestral music) - May I help you, sir? - My name is Jeff Ashton. - Oh, yes, the doctor's expecting you. Mr. Ashton is here. He'll be right with you. - Thank you. - Come on in, Jeff. Hold all my calls, huh? - Yes, sir. - You didn't call the police, did you? - Are you kidding? Of course not. - What'd you do with it? - I got rid of it. What would you want me to do, donate it to a medical school? - All right, all right, take it easy. It's just... Drink? - Yeah, a scotch. - It's just that it's such a hell of a shock after all this time. God. Whose arm do you think it is, anyway? - Who knows? Maybe one of the others. Mark or Bill? Who the hell knows? - I knew it. I knew we hadn't heard the last of this. It's Ted, isn't it? - Gotta be. The last thing he said to us was he'd never forget. - I thought he was in some institution somewhere? - He's out. - He's out? - I just called there. - He's a raving maniac! - That's right! Either he got better or he put on a damn good act. Important thing is he's out. - Jesus. Jesus, that miserable place. How the hell could I have enjoyed such a thing? Crawling around some damn hole in the ground. It's going to come back at us, Jeff. Hard. After five nightmarish years. (dark electronic music) - Jeff. Are you sure you know where the hell we're goin'? - I told ya. It's about two miles, right over that hill. - Should we carry packs? - No, if it's not any further than that, we can hike up there and come back for the packs. - It's your cave, Jeff, what do you say? - Let's take my pack, leave the others here. Bring the Colman's. - You're the boss! What's Colman's? - Why don't you guys relax and I'll rig up the elevator. That'll hold okay. Solid. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah, solid. - Okay. My pack. - Here's your hat. - I'll take the first ride. - Ready? - Yeah. - Give him a hand, guys. (suspenseful electronic music) (wood snaps) - [Jeff] Okay, next! - How's it look down there? - Looks okay from here. Not very big, though. Come on down! - Okay, I'll go next. (Sanders grunts) Looks like there was a cave-in over here. - Oh, that's old stuff, probably happened years ago. - What do you think, is it safe? - Hell, I don't know. That's what makes it exciting. - What do you say we split this cave and go to Vegas? (wood snaps) - This stuff is really rotten. - Why don't you guys stop worrying and get some samples? We oughta be outta here in time to get back to the Rover before dark. - When's lunch? - Fantastic. - Well, this old mountain's blown up top a couple times. - I don't know, you've seen one cave, you've seen 'em all. - Look at that. Look how this formation has pushed its way up through there. - Oh, yeah! (hammering thuds) Hey, Herman, what the hell are you doin'? - Well, isn't that what we're down here for? Collecting rocks? (hammering thuds) - You see what you did? - It's an old cave. (rumbling) - It's a cave-in! Take it easy! (tense electronic music) - [Man] It's locked, we're trapped! I told ya, god damn it, I told ya, I told ya! - [Jeff] Stop it, Ted! Stop it, Ted! - [Ray] You wanna start another cave-in? - [Jeff] Help him! (coughs) - [Sanders] I can feel air, it's comin' through here. It's open up above somewhere. - It's solid, we'll never make it. - Well, we gotta keep trying! - Wait a minute, wait. (grunts) - Easy, easy. - No! (coughs) That's no good, we need to get it to the Rover. - Well, we don't have it, so let's keep at it, huh? - All right! Come on, it's fine, let's think. Let's think. There's gotta be a way. - They'll find us, probably lookin' right now. - This was a two-week trip, remember? Who's expecting us now? - Oh, god, nobody. (coughs) - We'll wait. Must conserve every bit of energy we can. - There's no food and damn little water. (somber music) How many days now, Ray? - Just seven. - "Just seven," he says. - If I don't get anything to eat soon, there won't be anything left to rescue. - I once wrote a short story about a group of sailors who were lost at sea for 60 days. Know how they kept alive? - Fish? - Nope. They ate the weakest member of the crew. - Swell. Now we've come to cannibalism. We'll have to hold off until tomorrow. I can't eat meat on Friday. (chuckles) - You'd make an exception this time, wouldn't ya? (dark electronic music) - They should've found us two weeks ago. - [Man] We've had it, and you know it. - Ray? How much longer can we hold out? - That's the last of the water. Maybe tomorrow. - There isn't one chance in hell of anybody finding us by then. - What if... What if the men on that raft had, had only eaten parts of each other? Could they have survived? - Why? - Think about it. - I don't have to think about it! I know what's on your mind, you're crazy! - It's a way. Take a part from everyone in turn. - You wouldn't like me. I'd give you high cholesterol. (laughs) You're serious. You're god-damn serious. - I'm trying to stay alive. - You're talking about cannibalism. - He's talking about survival. - If anyone died, it would be pure murder. - That's cop talk, Mark. - What would you call it? - Like Ray said. Survival. - I don't think I could eat human flesh. - Christ. I know I couldn't. - Hey. Hey, this whole thing is sick! Just knock it off. - So we just sit here and rot? - Now, uh... Don't get me wrong... I'm not for it. Like, how would we decide? On who'd be first. - We draw straws. - It's crazy. - Would you rather die? - That's going too far. - You know a better way? - What part gets cut off the loser? - That's up to the loser. - Now, wait a minute. You sound like this has already been decided. Who gave you-- - You've already been told that some of us, maybe all of us, can't make it through tomorrow. - Is that true? (tense electronic music) - Come on. (Bill laughs) (suspenseful music) - My god, not me! Stay away from me! Keep away from me! - I'm sorry, Ted, you've lost! We all took our chances, you lost! - That means your life and ours! - No, please! - [Jeff] Hold him! Hold him! - You can't do this to me, I've got a family. Listen, please listen, give me another day. I promise, give me another day and I'll do it! They're all looking for us right now. Just a few more hours, please! - A few more hours won't make it any easier! - [Ray] We can hold off that much longer, my god! - [Jeff] What about it, Ray? - [Ray] A few more hours won't make that much difference! (Ted sobs) - All right. Get up, Ted. (Ted groans) - (groans) Geez! - The hell's goin' on? - What's goin' on? - He tried to kill me. - Are you all right? - Yeah, I don't know, I guess so. - You're lucky, it's not too deep. - You tried to kill me. - [Jeff] We might as well do it now. - No, no, you promised. (tense electronic music) A few more hours! A few more hours, please? Please. - The lighter. - Here, I got it, got it. - [Ted] Please, please, please! (screams) - [Ray] We need a tourniquet! - Use my belt. - Move back. (thud) - Ray. - Hold it. Get some more light down here. - All right, yeah. - [Ray] Mark? Okay. (Ted screams) (flesh squelches) (ominous tones) Okay. (Jeff coughs) (distant tapping) (dark music) (rocks crumble) - Who the hell knew? (distant tapping) - Won't matter. (thuds) When the newspapers and the law get through with us... We're gonna wish we all died. - What do you mean, "the law?" We only did it because we had to. - Mark's right. They'll crucify us. (distant tapping) (Herman laughs) - About your timing? (laughs) You butcher! It was your idea. You came up with it. Why should we take the blame? - No one has to take any blame, if we keep our heads. - Stop kidding yourself, Jeff. We've had it, all of us. - No, we haven't. Now, listen, all we have to say, is that Ted's arm was crushed in the cave-in! Ray had to amputate to save his life! (Bill laughs) - You think that Ted is gonna go for that? (laughs) - It doesn't matter, he's been delirious for over a week. Kept screaming that we'd cut off his arm for food, and nobody in the world's gonna believe that! - I don't know, people will believe anything. - There's no other choice! (distant tapping) - Maybe he's right. - What've we got to lose? - Nothing, now. (somber electronic music) - Mrs. Rogers, we tried to save his arm, but uh... - I asked you to wait. I begged you. I won't forget. - All right, men. (siren wails) Who would've thought exploring a cave would end like that? - Right now, I'm concerned about Ted Rogers. - I wonder who he got to. You know where the others are? - Bill and Mark's still in town. We oughta get together and talk about this. What about Herman? - Gwen? Would you see if you could find Mad Man Herman for me? He's at one of the Valley radio stations. Yeah. I'll find Herman, you get Mark and Bill. We'll meet at my place tonight. Eight o'clock okay? - Yeah. - All right. (crickets chirp) (doorbell chimes) (doorbell chimes) - Here he is. - Man, you are late. - What the hell is the matter with you, huh, Jeff? Now, you get an arm in the mail, an arm! And you don't report it? - You're damn right, can you imagine the headlines? - The hell with the headlines! - I hear you just made detective. - Right. - What's gonna happen to your career if this mess is stirred up again? - [Mark] There doesn't have to be any publicity. - Oh, come on, be realistic! Newspapers would be all over it. Some damn reporter would tie it in with what happened in the cave. Ted's family would be hounding us again. It'd open up the whole thing again. - It was bad enough five years ago. (suspenseful electronic music) - [Ray] I think we better report it. - That's what I'm trying to tell you, we go through legal-- - Hey, look, look, I gotta split, I got a show to do? - [Jeff] Okay, so we report it. Can you guys stand the heat? - [Ray] What do you mean? - Come on, Ray. You'll have patients staying away by the thousands. What about it, Herman? Are all those Lillie White sponsors gonna line up to buy time on your radio show? - No way. - Bill? How many building contracts are you gonna get, huh? I'd never sell another line to a TV show. Everyone satisfied? If the truth comes out, we're finished. - So what do we do, wait around for him to find us? Any one of us could be next. - [Herman] You sure know how to make a guy feel secure. - [Bill] He's probably just trying to throw a scare into us anyway. - Yeah, he succeeded. Look, whoever lost his arm didn't just donate it. I feel sorry for him. He's the way he is because of us, but he means business. - We've gotta get to him first. - What do we do when we find him? - [Jeff] Have his family put him away. Quiet, with no publicity. - Yeah, but how do we find him? - That's up to Mark. - That's easy. He's sitting somewhere, watching television, and drinking beer with his one good hand, just waiting for the doorbell to ring. - No, but his family should be able to help us. - If they will. - They oughta be as anxious as we are to keep this quiet. (suspenseful electronic music) - Ray? Is that you? (handle rattles) Ray? Answer me, don't be funny. Is that you? Answer me, Ray. Oh. - What's the matter, honey? (Mrs. Sanders chuckles) - I heard a noise at the door and the doorknob turned. You frightened me when you didn't come in. - There's been no one upstairs, you must've been dreaming. - No, I was wide awake, reading. - "The Psycho Lover?" (chuckles) What're you doing? You'll skip the psycho part and get to the lover part, you won't hear anymore noises. The guys will be going pretty soon and I'll be up. Okay? - Okay. - Don't waste any time, Mark. - I'll keep in touch. (suspenseful music) - [Mrs. Sanders] Everybody gone, dear? - Yes, dear. I'll be right up. (Ted laughs) (Ted laughs) - What's the matter? - Quiet. - Ray! - [Ray] Quiet, and just stay in this room. (door slams) Come on out, Ted. I know it's you. I don't wanna hurt you, Ted. (music intensifies and swells) (screams) (screams) (screams) (thuds) (screams) (Mrs. Sanders screams) (somber electronic music) - Ruth, is there anything we can do? - Can you give him his arm back? Mark, who did it? - We don't know. - You have an idea, though. You men haven't seen each other for five years, and you want me to believe that you just got together for old times' sake? - Our meeting again had nothing to do with this. - The last time you men got together, another man lost his arm. Why didn't you tell that to the police? - Ruth, I've had myself assigned to the case. Believe me, I will do everything I can. Let's go, Jeff. (suspenseful electronic music) (water splashes) (water splashes) (water splashes) (thuds and clunks) (tense electronic music) - Mark? Jeff. Just listen to me for a minute. Ted got to me. Here at the house. Yeah, I'm all right, just a bump on the head. Mark, we've gotta find this guy. Well, damn it, if you know where he lives, what're you waiting for? Yeah. Yeah, okay. Four o'clock. (suspenseful music) (knocks) What if he comes tearing out of that door with an ax? - [Mark] Miss Rogers? - Yes. - I'm Sergeant Mark Richards, this is Jeff Ashton. Do you remember us? - What do you want? - [Mark] We'd like to speak to your father. - He isn't home right now. - Could you tell us where he is? - What do you want him for? Is he in some kind of trouble? - That's what we'd like to find out, Miss Rogers. Do you know where he is? - Look, my mother's very ill. Could I talk to you somewhere else? - Of course. - Do you know the Sea View Hotel? - I know where it is. - [Rogers] I'll meet you there, in a half an hour in the lounge. - Fine. - What the hell are you doing? We practically have the guy and you walk away and leave him. We should've just gone in there. - Haven't you ever heard of a search warrant? I don't have one! Besides, this isn't my jurisdiction. - Do you think he was in the house? - I doubt it. It's too obvious, he's gotta know we're looking for him. - Yeah, I guess so. (suspenseful music) - Look, I've gotta call in. So I'll park the car and meet you inside, okay? - Fine. (background chatter) (peaceful piano music) She's not coming. She's helping Ted get away. - Looks like you're wrong, pal. Can I get you a drink? - No, thank you. I hope this is important. You know, my father has been in and out of hospitals for five years because of what you did to him. - Listen, we did what we had to do to-- - Jeff! - We did what we had to do to save your father's life. Now, you believe his story. Okay. If I were in your shoes, I'd probably do the same thing. So let's get right to the point. We've got to find him. - Why? - We think that he's the one who mutilated Dr. Sanders. - We also think that he assaulted me this morning. - Will you try and help us? - I haven't seen my father in three weeks. - [Jeff] But you must know where he is, or have some idea. - Has he ever, uh, talked about us to you? - Of course. For a while, you were all he talked about. Then about two years ago, he seemed to be getting better. Then he read something in the paper about Dr. Sanders, I think. And right after that, he started getting more and more depressed, talking about revenge. They took him back to the hospital. When he got home, he didn't mention you at all. He seemed almost normal. I really don't believe he did these things. - And, uh, you have no idea where he is now, huh? You have a brother, don't you? - Mm-hm. - Is he at home? - No, he's back east. He moved out right after high school. Couldn't stand it at home. - Well, uh, thanks for helping us. We better get movin'. - Yeah. (dark electronic music) (door slams) (tire hisses) Do you think she was telling us the truth? - Who knows? - We've just gotta find some way to protect ourselves. - Jeff. Look, he's obviously been stalking you, right? He sent you the arm, he attacks you in your own home, he leaves a message for you on the mirror. He probably followed you to Ray's house. Christ, for all we know, he's been following us all day. - So where does that leave us? - We've got to get him into some situation that'll bring him out into the open. - Yeah, well that's not gonna be easy. - You're telling me. It's getting late, I better get outta here. I'll think about it and maybe I can come up with some idea. - All right. - In the meantime, keep your doors and your windows locked. - Don't worry, locked and bolted. - Good. - Yeah. Listen, you be careful too, huh? - [Mark] I will, I'll see you tomorrow. - Okay, goodnight. (tense electronic music) (gun bangs) What the hell's going on? - Ted. He almost got me. - Are you all right? - I'm all right, I'm all right. - Sure? You know, there's, there's one sure way to bring Ted out into the open. The girl. - Use her as bait? - Right. - Look, we'll go over there tomorrow, see if she'll go along with it. (knocks) Could we talk to you for a few minutes? - I thought we talked about everything yesterday? - Teddy, your father tried to kill Mark last night. - That's right, we would like to try to trap him. So that we could capture him. - And you expect me to help you? - Would you? Look, he's a very sick man! If we don't get to him first, he could be killed. - I'm sorry. - I can understand how you feel, but if you'll come with us for a few minutes, I think I can change your mind. - Don't count on it. (somber electronic music) - How is he? - It doesn't look so good. Even if he regains his health, I don't think he'll ever recover emotionally. Even under heavy sedation, he wakes up screaming. It's horrible. - Ruth. Ruth, listen. He's a strong man, he'll be all right. - [Ruth] He was a strong man. - Now do you see what we mean? - (sighs) It's not new to me. I saw my father when he was in the hospital. - Well, I'm sorry we bothered you, Miss Rogers. - Wait. I'll help you. (upbeat music) - This is Mad Man Herman giving you temporary mwah. Stay tuned for that sparkling anticlimax that follows called Charlie Reagan. In the words of Camille, "I'll be back in a half hour, "after my coughing break." (upbeat music) - It's all yours. - Did you get my sandwich, Charlie? - I was running late, didn't have time. - Thanks a heap. Jesus, I've only got a half hour between shows. How do they expect me to go out, get something to eat, and be back in time? - Don't eat. - It's pretty obvious why no self-respecting deejay stays in this crummy station more than three months. - Well, you can leave at any time, no great loss. - Don't lose too much of the audience. (playful music) Harry, just the man I wanna see. - I'm in a hurry, I'm on the way to the last office now. - Man, do me a favor? - Nope. - You don't even know what I want. - I don't care what you want! You ever do me a favor? - Sure. Didn't I give an autographed picture of me in the nude? That's right, man, keep sweepin'. How long did you work here? (door slams) (wind blows) (suspenseful electronic music) (engine churns) (door slams) (door slams) (horn honks) (brakes squeal) - Hey, man, just comin' to work? - Funny. You know I'm on all night. I was goin' out to get a sandwich, now my car won't start. - Oh, hey, take mine. Leave the keys at the switchboard. - Thanks, man, I owe you one. At least I won't starve to death before sign off. (door slams) (tense electronic music) (engine revs) - [Mark] I'll bet you that he is getting ready to make his next move. - You're guessing. - I don't think so. If that message on the mirror was right, he's on the top of the list. - If I'm on the top of the list, why did he go after you? - I don't know. I don't know! Opportunity, maybe. Maybe he figured he'd get me and then come right in here and get you. - Two birds with one stone, huh? - What we've gotta do is get him to attack when we're ready. Teddy. What would your father do, if he thought that you were spending the night with Jeff? - The way he hates Jeff, he'd probably kill both of us. - Yeah, that's what I figured. All right, when I leave, you go around and start turning off all the lights. - Now, wait a minute. - I'll circle back around and wait for him outside. - Okay. - Let's try it. (suspenseful electronic music) - Goodnight, you nymphomaniac. You know what nymphomaniacs are? That's people who have trouble sleeping, around. (tense electronic music) (intercom buzzes) (smooth jazz music) Yeah, I know I shouldn't have said that on the air, but... - [Ted] How are you, Herman? - Splendid. - [Ted] I'd like to make a request. - Sir, if you are making an obscene phone call. Who is this? - [Ted] Just an old friend requesting a song. Why don't you play "I'll be seeing you?" - That dates both of us. Come on, now come on, who is this? (suspenseful electronic music) - You know, I tried for a really long time to hate all of you. - Do you? - I don't know. I just want it to all be over with. - Yeah. - And now a piece of nostalgia from World War Dos. I don't want her, you can have her, she's too fat for me. From that Disney classic, Beauty and Obese. (Teddy sighs) - It's been quite a while, what do you think? - I don't know. I just wish something would happen soon. This waiting's beginning to get to me. - Ladies, it's that time again. Why don't you come by and get reupholstered, at Mitchell's Upholstery? 35222 Ventura. Whether it's a sofa convertible or easy chair, Mitchell will put more spring in your zings. Zing in your spring. The hell with it. (scratches) (scratches) And now, another record done by that new swinging group, The Hormones. We'll give it a shot. (upbeat music) (cat meows) Aww, look what we have here. Come here, honey. (tense electronic music) (phone rings) (ominous music) - Hello? - [Ted] You never take enough from a man, do you? Now you have my daughter, too? - Ted? - [Ted] Listen to me, and listen good! When I get through with you, no woman will ever want you. - Is it? - Yeah, it's him. Try to talk to him. - Daddy? Daddy? (phone clicks) He hung up. - You want some coffee? (smooth jazz music) Milk or nothin', right? You're right, coffee makes you nervous. Heavy heavy. (chuckles) This far-out instrumental group recently gave a concert, and almost got arrested for taking out their instruments in public. What do you mean this show is in bad taste? Ho-ho-ho. (laughs) (intercom buzzes) (upbeat jazz music) Yeah. - [Ted] Herman. - Ted? - [Ted] Herman. - It's you, isn't it? Hi, man. (laughs) Ted, remember, I was the only one who didn't go along with what they did. You remember that? Operator? - [Operator] Yes? - Hello, yeah, I-- - Can I help you? - I've been receiving some threatening phone calls here. - How many? - Two in the last few minutes. - Well, we have to hear it. - I'll try to keep him on. - What's your number? - My number here is 461-3771. - [Operator] Well, when he calls again, contact us at once. - Thanks, I'd appreciate that. (tense electronic music) - Need any help? You ain't allowed to park around. Is this a hold-up? - No, I'm police officer! - Oh, thank god. - Mister, you don't know how close you came to getting it. Now, please, would you get outta here before you get hurt? - Oh, yes, always willing to cooperate with the police. (Mark sighs) (intercom buzzes) (upbeat jazz music) - Yeah? - [Ted] Herman. - Ted Rogers? - [Ted] How are you, Herman? - Thought I didn't recognize you, huh? You were the one who cut off Ray's arm. You know, Dr. Ray Sanders. I wanna help you, Ted, I'm your friend. I wouldn't talk to the police, you know that. You know me. Good ol' Mad Man Herman. KLIG Radio, situated at 3030 Chapel Road. No, Ted, don't hang up. (smooth jazz music) (pills rattle) This is Mad Man Herman, just chewing on a nitroglycerin tablet. Mm, good. (tense electronic music) (intercom buzzes) Hello. - [Operator] Sir, this is the operator. What is your address there? Where are you? - 3030 Chapel Road, KLIG Radio, why? - [Operator] Sir, the calls, the ones you asked us to trace? Well, they're coming from your other line. Whoever it is, is in the building with you. (tense electronic music) - This is Mad Man Herman. This is your old Mad Man. Someone's in the studio. (screams) (glass smashes) (intense electronic music) (dark electronic music) (cat meows) (suspenseful music) - Get down! - Jeff, it's me! It's me. - [Jeff] My god, I thought you were Ted. - I know. Herman's dead. - [Jeff] Herman? - I just got it on the car radio. He was at the station, he was on the air. - Was it-- - Just like Ray. Who are you calling? - Police. - It's too late, Jeff. We've been withholding evidence. I'd be suspended, we'd both be put in jail. Tomorrow, we'll get Bill, and the three of us will stick together until, until we find Ted. - Yeah. Well, it's the only thing we can do. (suspenseful electronic music) - Excuse me. Where could we find Bill Hale? - Well, let's see, he came by here just a little while ago. He's probably over at the mill. That's that big shed right around the corner. - Thank you. - Yeah. (saw screeches) - I think it's okay now, huh? Run a couple of boards through just to make sure. - Hey, Bill? We gotta talk to you for a minute. - [Bill] Go help Charlie unload the truck. We'll finish tomorrow. - You heard about Herman? - You would have to be deaf, dumb, and blind not to hear about it. Oh, the news media's havin' a ball with it. - Ted made damned fools of us. We thought for sure I was next. Now it could be any one of us. - You think I don't know that? - You know he's not gonna stop. - That's why I'm carrying one of these. - Bill, listen, we've all gotta stay together now. - You see, the way I figure it, that way he can't isolate-- - Wait, wait a minute! You two stick together, I can take care of myself! - You mean you're not gonna work with us? - It's work with you guys that got me in this whole mess! Hey, as far as I'm concerned, you get yourself one of these, and every man does his own number. (phone rings) (sports commentary from TV) Hello. Yeah, this is Bill Hale. Fire? At the yard? Yeah, I'll be right there. Who is this? (tense electronic music) - It's time for his walk, he gets a little excited. Come on, Sebastian, in, in. That's a good boy. Ah, ah, ah, not yet, this isn't the lobby. Come back, Sebastian, that's it. - I know I look a mess, but, I have to go out and get a TV guide. I've been looking for this program all week, and I can't find it. - All right, Sebastian, come on. Come on, now you hold it until we get outside.

This is Teddy. Listen, Daddy just called, he's on his way after Bill. - [Jeff] Try and reach Mark, I'm on the way over there. - Okay. (suspenseful electronic music) (tires screech) (gate hums) (engine revs) (tires screech) (gate hums) (gate clacks) (door slams) (tense electronic music) (thuds) (elevator dings) (elevator dings) (elevator dings) (Bill gasps) (Bill yelps) (flesh squelches) (Bill groans) (Jeff pants) (ominous music) He told me on the phone about Bill, it couldn't have been more than 15 minutes after I talked to Jeff. - Who did he pick to be next, or didn't he tell you that? - [Teddy] No. - Well, what did he say? He did talk, didn't he? - Please, Jeff. - [Mark] Do you have any idea where he is, any at all? - You promise me you won't hurt him? - He's already killed two men, he's mutilated a third! Now, what the hell do you want, lady? - He wants to meet me. - [Mark] Where? - At Trankus Cliff on the beach. I don't think my father's gonna fall for this. He said "come alone." - I think you're wrong. When he sees you with me, he'll have to do something. - Maybe he won't show up. - There's someone following us right now. - It's probably Mark. - Nope. He's already at the beach. (eerie electronic music) (footsteps thud) (distant waves crash) (doors slam) (waves crash) (footsteps shuffle) (Mark groans) - [Ted] Jeff! - Mark? - [Ted] Jeff! - What is it? (body clunks) (Teddy gasps) (engine starts) (tense music) (tires screech) (tires screech) (engine roars) (dark electronic music) - What are we going to do? - Get away. Just get me away from here. - Yes. - Where are we going? - Oh, my brother has a cabin in the mountains. We'll be safe there. - Ted will find us. - No, no, he never knew about it. (door slams) (door slams) - Teddy, I... I don't know how to thank you for helping me like this. - Jeff? Don't move. There's someone I want you to meet. (door slams) - Ted? Ted! Ted, no, wait! Wait! (groans) - Roger, you were beautiful. Daddy will be so proud of his son. (chuckles) Here, let me help you. (Roger grunts) (chuckles) - Come on, sis, help me get him into the house. - Okay. Good morning. Would you like some coffee? - No, thanks, sis. - It sure is nice having the family together again. - It's too bad Mother couldn't be here. - (sighs) Yeah. - She never really understood us. - No, only Daddy did. - He's a wonderful father, (chuckles) and I'm glad we could do this for him. - It's just like Christmas, isn't it? Wow, what a nice surprise. Let's do it now, okay? (dark electronic music) Good morning, Daddy. We have a wonderful surprise for you. We're going to make you well again, Daddy. When you see what we've got for you, you're gonna come back to us. Come on, help me, Roger. Come on, Daddy. (dark electronic music) Good morning, Mr. Ashton. Did you have a nice sleep? - Where am I? What are you doing to me? - Nothing. We're not going to do anything to you. - Ted? Ted, please! I know you're behind this! Please! Just get it over with! (sobs) Please! I can't take it anymore! (sobs) Please, Ted! (sobs) - No. No, not Ted. My daddy never hurt anybody in his whole life. He never has. He never could. - But I did. All of you. For him. - Where is he? Ted? Are you here? Listen to me! Listen! - Shh, no need to shout. Daddy's right here. (dark electronic music) - My god. You've killed three men. And Ted will never even know it. He'll never even know it! - Oh, yes, he will! He will, just as soon as he sees what we're doing. - But you said you weren't going to hurt me. - I said we wouldn't do anything to you and we're not. You're going to do it. Just like you did to Daddy. And this time, it'll be your idea again. - You mean... Cut off my own arm? - Either that, or starve. When you get hungry enough, you'll do it. - You're insane. Insane! (groans) - You know you have to do it. It's the only way you'll live. I have a little present for you. You see that wall over there? You see that little door? Open it. There you go. Oh, Daddy, you should see. It's your scalpel! Now it's all up to you. - No! No. No. I won't, you hear? I won't do it. Never! Never! Never! Never!
