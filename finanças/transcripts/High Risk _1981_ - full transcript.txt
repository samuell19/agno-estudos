- [Reporter] The big news in Los Angeles this morning is the weather. An inch and a half of rain fell on the Southland last night in what appears to be the tail end of California's rainy season. Blue skies are expected before noon today. The temperature in Downtown L.A. is 56 degrees. News time now is 6:38. Two more automobile manufacturing plants are threatening to close their doors. This could cause a substantial number of auto workers to join the already swollen ranks of the unemployed. The fight against inflation seems to be still losing ground. Washington sources believe that the administration's tax breaks to big businesses and programs will have little or no effect on the economy for at least two years. Gang violence is in the news again and for today's special report-- (funky rock music) (horn honks) - Great weather we're havin', huh? - We still going? - [Stone] Damn right, we're goin'. Go ahead, get in. - C'mon, I'm gettin' wet. - You forgot your rod. - I don't know what I'd do without you, baby. Okay. - You two take care. - Okay. - Get this thing in here. - Would you watch it with that thing? - Will you just get into the truck? Come on. - Bye bye. - See you later, Stone. - [Stone] Bye bye. - [Rockney] Leaving, ha! - [Tony] Did you get everything? - [Stone] Yeah, I got everything. - [Rockney] I haven't been up this early since I got on unemployment. Come on, woo! (funky rock music) - You know, what if he calls? What do I do? - Uh, tell him the check's in the mail. (horn honking) - Have a good time, okay. Call if you're near a phone. - I won't. - [Wife] Bye! - You got enough stuff? - Yeah, let's just go. (funky rock music) - What the hell's the cooler for? - [Dan] Looks good, now let's just go. (funky rock music) (engine revs) - Come on, it's just you and me, baby. - Hey, here we go! - Okay, everybody take their last malaria pill? - [Dan] Hey, why do you got to take that for six weeks? Did you know that? - [Rockney] Hey, how do you say where's the bathroom in Spanish? - [Tony] There's no bathrooms where we're going. - [Dan] All I want to know is what do we say if we get caught? (speaks in foreign language) - [Stone] We're not gonna get caught. - [Rockney] We won't hurt anyone. (funky rock music) (birds twittering) (Rockney sighs) - You sure this is the right place? - Yeah. (birds twittering) - Hey, what time is it? - It's 10. - I wonder what Charlene is doing? - She's probably with her old boyfriend George by now. (Tony laughs) - [Rockney] You're real funny, you know that? Real funny. - Goin' out with the plumber, I guess. (Dan laughs) Just like last time. - Both of you are real funny, you know that? (all laughing) - [Stone] This looks like him now. (engine rumbles) Stay here, okay? (dog barking) - There is no substitute for love but more love. There is no substitute for forgiveness but more forgiveness-- - How ya doing? (dog growls) - [Evangelist] There's no substitute for Jesus. - Hi. - Ya got the money? - Brothers and sisters-- - Yeah. - [Evangelist] I want you now to bow your heads. (Stone grunts) - Well, we'd like to see the stuff first. - Friendly lookin' people, huh? (Dan grunts) - [Tony] Let's go. - [Evangelist] Pray for the souls of those children for murder, no matter how accidental. - Nice lookin' dogs. - I can trust 'em. Just the four of ya? - [Stone] Yeah. - [Evangelist] That weapon with no heart. - [Clint] Looks like ya got a mixed bunch. - This is, uh, Clint. - Hey, how ya doin'? - Hi. - Hey, you boys aren't gonna doin' anything to hurt any animals now, are ya? - No. - Oh no, sir. (doors squeak) (Rockney whistles) - [Rockney] Jesus Christ. - Well, seein' as how ya didn't know exactly what you'd be needin', I got ya somethin' for every occasion. Here's a couple of 357s for close-up work. There ya go. Here's a M16 automatic for anything up to 400 yards. (gun clicks) Easy to work. The Israeli machine gun. - Wait a minute. Hey, what is this? - Yeah, what's it look like? - You said we were gonna need a couple of pistols for snakes. - [Rockney] Yeah, this wasn't the deal. - Hey, we're gonna be carrying a lot of stuff. What if we run into some bandits or something? - Bandits? - Yeah. - There's bandits? - Bandits? There's enough stuff here for a war. - You can count me out. - Me too. - Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute. Have you got a second, Clint? - Sure, go ahead. - Excuse us for a second. - [Dan] Now look, you didn't say anything about this. And what's this shit about bandits? - I just asked him to get us what we needed. So he went overboard a little. - You said no violence! - It's just protection. It's not violence. - Protection? That's bullshit, and you know it. - What's bullshit? I sold everything I own for this, everything, my house, even the goddamn dishes. And you call it bullshit. What did you sell? What do want, just somebody to hand you a million bucks, huh? - I'd take it. - Hey, look, if we don't go ahead with this, you forget the dreams. We're gonna be bustin' our butts for the rest of our lives for a pension that won't even pay the bills. - It's a hell of a lot better than being dead. - Hey, nobody's gonna get hurt. If you don't like what you see when you get down there, you can back out. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. You want to be poor all our life? - [Dan] It'd be a hell of a weekend. - Got a lot to gain. - (laughs) Jesus Christ! (guns firing) - Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, ho, hold it! Look, boys, it's not how many bullets you shoot. It's what you hit that counts. Now let me have that thing. Now look, quit squintin' your eyes and just point the damn thing and squeeze, you see. Like this. (gun firing) (glass clatters) Make sense? Yeah. Now let's put that thing on automatic. Yeah. (gun fires) - Should I pull this out, too? - Go ahead. (rifle clicks) (rifle firing) - Hey! (Rockney laughs) - Woo! - What it is? Hey, mister. - No need to grin, man, no need to grin. If there'd had been a man out there, he'd have blown your head off. (machine gun firing) - Hey, look at that. - Woo! - It does the same thing to a human skull. - [Rockney] Oh, hey, you mind takin' a picture of us? - Sure. Yeah, good. - [Rockney] Hit that little button right there. - Okay. Uh, let's not get by the truck, fellas. Let's get over there. (rifle clicks) Press this thing here? - [Rockney] Just push it in. - Just slide it! - Just push this in? - I don't know. - Push that bottom in. - Okay. You boys got a name? - No. - You got a cause? - Yeah. Inflation. - (laughs) The times must be changin'. Last 10 years been nothin' but causes. You're just a bunch of gringos headin' south, huh? - Yeah. (camera clicks) (engine whirring) - [Dan] What lens did he use here? - 1000. - [Dan] I can't figure out why he didn't rip 'em off himself if he had the combination. - [Stone] No balls. They killed his brother down there. - So how much we getting up front? (rock music) - Three full tanks of gas. ♪ Can't you see I'm playin' - And a bottle of tequila. - We didn't get any money? - No. We're gonna get the money when they get the money. - How did they find out about this? - The big guy's a cameraman. He did a documentary on cocaine dealers. - Bunch of amateurs, man. How you guys doing? - I thought you said it'd be gettin' cooler? - It's cool. It's cool. - Hey, how can we be sure that they're gonna come back? - We're givin' them 200 grand. (dog whines) Let's go over this one more time. The hacienda is situated here on the east local mountain. Only access is from the sea, up this road. Now we jump and land right in the mountains, hit 'em from behind. We go back over the mountains and into the Amazon. The plane'll pick us up right here, at the old mines. If any one of us gets separated, what? - Uh, follow any of the rivers till they get to the falls. Take us right to the falls. - Okay. - Did you see any snakes while you were down there? - Nothing over 10 feet. - What the hell are you doin'? - I'm taping up my pant legs. I don't want anything crawlin' up 'em. Want some tape? - [Tony] No, that's okay. - [Dan] Gonna need tape. - We'll be up over target in about 20 minutes. Anybody want any body stimulants? Oh, it's strictly organic. - No, we'll just, uh, start getting ready, thanks. - You guys have a good one. - Body stimulants? (engine whirs) - [Bradley] In about five minutes. - I can't jump with all this stuff. I can't even stand up. - Who gets the dog? - I'll take him. Where'd you get this dog, anyway? - A little old lady in the park. All right, everybody understand how the safety chute works? - John, now listen, these chutes are different than the ones you showed us. - Danny, they work the same. - Yeah, right, well-- - What have you got there? - [Dan] Is this, is this the pull string? - Safety chute is situated in front of the parachute. - Okay. - In case of emergency, pull the strap. You better keep that. - We're comin' in on target. Looks like a nice open area to the left. It's a lovely temperature outside. We hope that you've enjoyed flying on Eos Airlines. Hope that we can further fulfill you future traveling needs. Adios. - [Stone] Looks good. - Remember, jump close together. The chutes'll open automatically if there is a foul up. - Can he get a little lower? - No way. Okay, get ready. Go! - Three days! - 200,000! (Stone yells) - [Rockney] Oh shit! (playful music) (Dan yells) (playful music) Jesus Christ! I'd call it the right faith. (upbeat music) How is it? - [Stone] Hard. (body thumps) - [Rockney] Oh goddammit. - What happened? (liquid patters) - The dog peed on me. - [Dan] Here we go. Bend the knees, bend the knees! Bend the-- (body thumps) (gun fires) - What's goin' on? - I'm okay. - What happened? - Went off. - [Stone] What have I told you about using your safety? - Uh, semi, fire, safe, oh, over here. (safety clicks) Right. - [Rockney] He remembers to come back. - He will. Spare the chutes and get movin'. (solemn music) - You know what this stuff looks like? - Yeah. It's a bush. (solemn music) (dog barks) (solemn music) - [Tony] That's it, huh? - [Stone] That's it. In about 40 minutes, the people will settle in for their siesta. We wait about an hour and then move on down. - Now why don't we wait until it's dark? - Less security now. (solemn music) - This is really goddamned stupid. Do you know that? - You know what? (horse whinnies) You say that going to work, every morning. - [Rockney] You realize nobody knows we're down here? If anything happens to us, that's it. You got any of them vitamins with you? - [Dan] Yeah, you want one? - [Tony] How the hell can you guys eat at a time like this? - [Rockney] I always eat when I get nervous. (horse neighs) (Rockney grunts) - [Tony] You think you could kill someone if you had to? - [Rockney] Hm, I never even thought of it. - You? - (chuckles) I've never even seen a dead person. (gun clicks) (rooster crows) - Hey, let's talk about something else, huh? - Looks all clear, let's get it over with. Come on. (guns clicking) Let's go. (solemn music) (dog barking) (solemn music) (suspenseful music) (dog groans) - Go on. Go on, go on, go on, baby. (suspenseful music) Go on, go on, baby. Go on, go on! (suspenseful music) Hey, hey, go on. (small dog barks) (guard dogs growling) (dogs barking) - [Dan] How's she doing? - Okay, let's go. (dogs barking) (Rockney grunts) - Let's go. (parrot squawks) (speaking in foreign language) - I thought you said everyone was sleeping. (speaking in foreign language) - [Rockney] Jesus Christ. - Danny, watch the window. - People all around this place. - [Tony] This is goddamned stupid. (wood rattling) - She's just swimmin', but there's a guard out there now. (lock rattling) - What's the matter? - I don't know. - Aw, man. - They've changed the combination. - Jesus Christ. - What happened? - He changed the combination. Hey, we're gettin' outta here. - I'm not leaving here without the goddamned money. - Are you crazy? - Look, look, John, John, now let's just regroup, and we'll think of somethin' else. - We're gettin' out of here. - [Stone] I'll make him talk. - Wait a minute, wait a minute. He's right. I'll just do a little number on him. - What number? - Oh fine! Look, we're goin' home. - You know what to do? - Just get him down here. (Danny chuckles) - Come on, let's just get it over with, Tony. - It'll be okay. - Great. - What the hell are you talkin' about? (solemn music) (door clicks) (people chattering) - [Serrano] You acted wisely, General. - [General] Can I expect you in my place next Thursday? - 9:30? - Wonderful. I will open some chardonnay at the bar. (speaks in foreign language) - Beautiful, beautiful. - (laughs) Oh will you please say goodbye to Anna for me? - Of course, General. - Goodbye, amigo. - Safe journey, General. (tense music) (lighter clicks) (tense music) (gun clicks) (solemn music) (knuckles rapping) - [Serrano] Enter, Manuel. - Yes? - Where is Jean Trevejo? What about Guttiere? - [Manuel] He's come into power. If the people get word, they can take him down. (suspenseful music) - [Serrano] Where've you got him? - [Manuel] He's staying at-- (tense music) - [Serrano] I'm going down to Miami, next Wednesday. (tense music) (sings in a foreign language) - Please, lady, please. (dramatic music) - Manuel. - Yes? - Did the bulls arrive? - Oh, of course. (speaks in foreign language) (Serrano laughs) - We'll play later. (car door thuds) (engine revs) (solemn music) (gun clicks) What can I do for you, sir? - We're going downstairs. - Downstairs? (tense music) - Uh-uh. I will blow your head off. (solemn music) Let's go. (solemn music) - Good dope-pushin' son of a bitch, I'm gonna kill you. - Wait a minute, wait a minute! Let me try talkin' to him, first. - Cut his faggot ear off. - Give him a chance. Just let me talk to him. Okay, look, just tell us the combination to the safe. - Yes, and I'll open it for you, if you want me to. - Oh, well, go ahead. - Uh-uh, uh-uh. Just give me the numbers. - Right, one. Left, two. Three. (lock clicks) - Holy shit! - Give me a pack. Give me a pack. - How much is in there? - How much? - Five million in cash, maybe a little more. But you're not gonna get five miles. - Tie him up and gag him, both of 'em. - Sit down, please. (speaks in foreign language) - [Stone] We got to get rid of all this stuff. We need room for the money. What the hell is this? - Oh, I got to keep my toilet paper. - Wine. - Put some of this in that pack. - No, no, no. - Huh? - [Stone] Just the money. (speaks in foreign language) - We're gonna need a truck to carry all this. We gonna need a goddamned truck! Take it, take it, I ain't got time. There's some that fell down over there. - Put some in your pockets, too. But I don't think we're gonna have enough room. - [Rockney] Charlene's gonna die when she sees all this. She is gonna die. - Tears right off. - [Tony] Here, fill this up. Gimme some more. - This is beautiful, beautiful, man, beautiful. I'm gonna buy me a new Eldorado or somethin'. Fill it up, fill it up. - [Stone] Don't breathe too deep. I just broke open his stash. - There's little bit more room in here. - Don't forget the side ones. Okay, that's it. Let's go, let's go. - [Danny] Oh! (speaks in foreign language) - Shh, shh, shh. - What are we gonna do with him? - [Stone] Knock him out. - [Dan] Oh come on, will ya? - What are you gonna do, take him with you? - We'll tape him up. - Shh, shh! (gun thuds) (guard yells) Just hit him again. Hit him! (gun thuds) (gun fires) (parrot squawks) - Oh they're shooting! Let's go! (dramatic music) (guns firing) - [Rockney] Goddammit, Stone! (guns firing) (tense music) I knew this would happen. I knew it! (dramatic music) - Shoot! - [Rockney] What if you miss? - Don't shoot, just run! - [Rockney] Good idea! (solemn music) Dammit! (gun fires) (dramatic music) - Now they're really pissed. - Let's just keep going. - I think I'm hit. - Let me see, let me see. Where? Oh, that's just a scratch. - [Tony] I don't believe this. - Well, I don't know how it feels. - [Tony] Shh! (solemn music) - Let's go, let's go, move! (engines rev) (dramatic music) Horses! Give 'em some money. Get down, get down. How do you say get down? (speaks in foreign language) Tony, get yourself a horse. (dramatic music) (speaks in foreign language) - Guys, they're coming back! - Come on, man, get on. - They're comin'. - Hey, Tony! - [Rockney] Come on, let's go! (gun fires) - [Stone] Come on! - Hey, you guys, hey, wait for me, wait for me! I don't even know how to ride a horse. (guns firing) (dramatic music) (sheep bleating) - You see anything? - No, I think we lost them. - Can we go home now? - Yeah, we're going home now. - Hey, senor, you want to be poor all your life? - Little ass on top of big ass (laughs). Five million bucks, you know what I mean? I can't, I can't believe it. (both grunt) - Hey, asshole, how's it feel being a millionaire? - You're still a crazy son of a bitch. - Woo, woo-hoo! You better get down. (Tony giggling) (solemn music) - [Tony] My ass is killin' me from that mule. - A real nice house cost these days? - About 150. 200,000 if you want a pool and stuff. - [Stone] That could leave about a million to play around with, you know. - [Rockney] Hell, wow, that's gonna be real nice. - Hey, is this water safe to drink? - Too late now. - What are you gonna do with your money, Danny? - I don't know. Rent a new wife? - Hmm, I got dibs on the old one. - You always did. (Danny laughs mockingly) - You know I'm worried. - About what? - Inflation. - What? - What'd you know about inflation? - We've got to go back, spread this money around and get the old US of A back on its feet again. - [Tony] I'd give five grand for a cheeseburger right now. (gun clicks) (horse whinnies) - Wait a minute, somebody's coming. It's just the damn dog. (dog groans) - Baby, oh, pooch! Baby, come here! (dog barking) You poochie, you (laughs)! - [Tony] I hope nobody followed her. - Baby, you missed me, didn't ya? (dog barking) Oh yeah, mm, it's good to see ya. Oh baby, we got to clean you up, sugar. - I think he's got somethin' goin' with that dog. - [Rockney] You didn't like them Latin lovers, did ya? (Rockney laughs) - Anybody feel like a hot dog? - (laughs) Hot dog, man, give him a kiss. Give the Latin a kiss, babe (laughs). It's so good to see ya. We gonna clean you up, straighten your little ribbon out and get all this mess out of your hair. (solemn music) (horse neighs) (dog barks) Come on, baby, now let me sleep, huh? (horse whinnies) (ominous music) You guys, wake up, wake up. Look over there. (ominous music) Looks like a whole damn army. - Jesus, how many are there? - [Rockney] What are they doing down here? - [Tony] I'll give ya two guesses. (solemn music) - Let's go, let's go. (dramatic music) - Over there! Open fire! (guns firing) - Give me your pack. (guns firing) (dog barking) Come on, let's go! - Come on, come on, come on! (guns firing) (solemn music) (Tony grunts) - [Rockney] I knew this would happen. I knew it. - Go that way. Go that way! (solemn music) - Over there! Come on! Hey, come on. Over there. Come here, come here. (dramatic music) - We shoulda stopped, dammit! We shoulda just stopped! - What good is that gonna do? We get out of here alive. Then we can buy 'em back. - Well, who would want to buy them back if they're dead? (guns firing) Go, go, go! (guns firing) (dramatic music) (horse neighs) (guns firing) - [Stone] Assholes! - [Dan] Don't hit anybody! - What? - We may end up being their prisoners. - You want to quit ? They shot my horse. - Let me just-- (gun fires) It wasn't even your horse! (gun fires) - Go! (gun fires) (speaks in foreign language) (bull grunting) (speaks in foreign language) (Serrano laughs) (speaks in foreign language) (bull grunting) (speaks in foreign language) (solemn music) (Serrano laughing) (crowd applauding) (speaks in foreign language) (bull snorts) (solemn music) (horse nickers) - Did you enjoy the contest? You got here just in time. You know, sometimes the horse makes a mistake. And at that moment, he knows that, he knows his insides are gonna be scattered all over the arena. But these are very special horses, the Andalusians. They're willing to risk everything for that moment. Are you, huh? Where's my money? - I don't know. - You don't know? (Rockney grunts) (dramatic music) (fist thuds) (Rockney grunts) In a minute, his spleen will be ruptured and the lining of his stomach. He'll start to bleed from the nose and from the mouth, like that bull. (solemn music) (Rockney grunting) - Tell 'em to stop. - You remembered? (solemn music) - [Stone] What do you think? - [Dan] I think we'd better negotiate with 'em. (gun firing) Ah shit! Shit, oh damn. (gun fires) (suspenseful music) Stop shakin' it! (suspenseful music) (speaks in foreign language) Move it, will ya? (suspenseful music) (gun fires) (speaks in foreign language) We give up! Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. - [Stone] Goddamned assholes! (gun fires) Steady, steady, goddammit! (suspenseful music) (gun fires) (Danny and Stone yell) (soldiers laugh) Where are ya? - [Dan] Where the hell do you think I am, goddammit! - [Stone] Let go, you'll make it. - Let go? - [Stone] Let go, Dan, goddammit, let go. - Climb up, climb up! - Let go! Let go! - Right now? (Danny yells) How did you know we could make it? - I didn't. I figured if you'd make it, I'd be okay. (speaks in foreign language) - [Rockney] Next time I see that son of a bitch, I'm gonna kill him. - Here, put some ice on it. - Hey, hey. What's that? - It's a Coke. You want some? - Oh man. - Hey. They were gonna kill you. - So you told them, huh? - I told him where I buried the money. - What, what money? - Listen, they only found your money. They didn't know Stone was carryin' mine. So I told them I buried it. - Oh yeah, that's great. That's real terrific. - Listen, tomorrow, when they take us down there to find it, it's gonna be a hell of a lot easier trying to escape out there than it is in here. - You think they're gonna let you walk out there? Man, they're gonna have you handcuffed, and when they find that there's no money buried there, they're gonna shoot both of us. (brick clatters) - Hi. - Hi. - Oh, you're Americans. Where you from? - California. Why? - Why not? What'd you do to your ear? - He cut it. - How much were you carryin'? - We weren't carrying anything. - You got a lawyer? - No, why? - Do not trust Roberto Reyes. Got any money? - No. - Well, whatever you got, they're gonna get it. And whatever your family's got, they're gonna get that too. And then, just maybe then, if they get tired of feedin' ya, or if they get bored with your company, which I don't think should take them too long to do that, then just maybe they'll let you go. - How long you been in for? - Five months, three weeks and two days. Two Italian guys on the other side, they've been in here for three years. Of course, they've gotten to know each other pretty well by now. Oh, you, you, you guys got any grass? - No. - Oh, you want to buy some? - Who the hell is she? Put the brick back. - We'll talk to you later. - Some neighbors you gonna be. Couple of goddamned bores. Listen, you better develop a sense of humor. You're not gonna make it if you don't. (rooster crows) - You okay? - Yeah. (Rockney sighs) And I was gonna get married next month. ♪ I'm a rambler ♪ I'm a gambler ♪ I'm a long way from home ♪ And if ya don't like me ♪ Then leave me alone Anything? - No, nothing. How's it going? - Okay. It's about dry. Gonna be lighter now. All we got to do is pick it up. We'll get 'em back. Look, we got $4 million. We could put Donald Duck in the White House. Hey, uh, you, uh, you got two 50s for a 100? - Use a leaf. Get out of here. (gun clicks) - [Dan] Hey, John. - Right here. - [Dan] You know something? - What's that? - [Dan] I'm glad we did this. I mean, I wanted to do this more than anybody. - Dumb shit. - [Dan] Hell, it's not just the money. It would be nice to bring the bacon home, for a change, get Dale something. It's not the money. I mean, all my life, I wanted to do just one thing where I had to put it on the line, you know? (gun clip clicking) Fight the dragon. (gun clicks) (Dan chuckles) Jeez, I mean, shit, I've been scared all my life, might as well be something worth being scared about, right? (solemn music) Just wasn't smart enough to know that it was gonna be so hard. But I'll tell ya, if we get out of this, first thing I'm gonna do is move away from that goddamn airport. I mean, every time a 747 comes over, I think I'm gonna lose my-- - Gringo. You want some paper? Here's a piece. Come on, I think you need it. (solemn music) (speaks in foreign language) (bandits laughing) Yes, right. (people chattering) (rooster crows) (speaks in foreign language) - Give me the watch. - What's happening? - Give me the watch! - What's happening? - Just shut up. (speaks in foreign language) - [Rockney] What the hell is going on? - [Tony] He's gonna give us the chain off the truck, relax. - [Rockney] Oh man. That little dude is gonna take my watch and split. - [Tony] You see that, what'd I tell ya? - [Rockney] Jesus Christ. - [Tony] You can trust the kids down here. (speaks in foreign language) - What's he saying? - He wants something else. - Well, give him your ring. - What do you mean, give him my ring? No way. (speaks in foreign language) - What's going on? - He wants our shirts and our boots. - He can have my shirt but not my boots. - What do you mean? You're a hell of a lot of help. Listen, little person, let me tell you something. - Don't make him mad. - [Tony] What do you mean, don't make him mad? - [Rockney] He's our only hope, now, come on. - [Tony] No, sir, I'm not gonna even do that. (speaks in foreign language) - Don't start that antagonist shit. We in the wrong neighborhood. Now take it off. - I bought-- - Take the shirt off, take it off right now! - I'm gonna kill that little bastard - I don't care what you're gonna do. You can do it later. - I'm gonna kill that little son of a bitch. - Just take the shirt off! (speaks in foreign language) - [Rockney] What's that? - [Tony] Hot, it's hot. (rooster crows) (speaks in foreign language) (Tony chuckles) - What'd he say? What'd he say, what'd he say? - He wants to know what you did with the clothes.
