(dramatic music) (suspenseful music) Hi, my name is Frank. I'm a couple's therapist. You know, I had this one, couple, I did counseling for a long time, and this is kind of the last resort for them. I've invited them out here for Thanksgiving dinner. I don't expect much. He seems to be a little lazy and I think she's at her wits end with him, but one can always hope. Maybe like whittling a masterpiece out of a piece of wood, they can salvage something from their marriage, At any rate, hopefully they'll have a nice Thanksgiving dinner. I'll let them use the cabin for the weekend. Maybe little sparks'll ignite again. One can only hope. (whittling, scraping sound) So, Jackie, what do you hope to accomplish this weekend? I wanna, I want him to want me, like he did when we first met, like, I want me, I want him, I wanna feel loved and you know, wanted, needed, he doesn't, he doesn't do anything. I do everything. I try everything. I, he's a gambler. I pay all the bills. I pay the mortgage. He doesn't make me feel sexy, wanted. I want that feeling. I wanna, That's terrible. I wanna feel like a woman again. Let me ask you something. If it turns out that he's incapable of being the man that you want him to be, would you look elsewhere for your satisfaction? I've thought about it, but I, I, I, I haven't done it. I, I have, I just, oh, oh, okay. Why is that? Why is that recording? Why are we recording? Oh, it's standard procedure. I record all my sessions. Yeah. Well, it's making me really feel uncomfortable. It shouldn't, it's for both our benefits and I can review it at the end of the day and see if I made any mistakes, could have done something different. All right? But let me ask you something. So, I mean, you would take somebody to, you know, caress you and perhaps, you know, get a little risque and show you what they want and show you what you need. Are you asking me for him? Or are you asking me for somebody else? From somebody else? I'm just asking. I'm a therapist. I need to know these things. I would want it from him, not from somebody else. But the question I asked is if he's incapable of doing that, are you going the rest of your life without it? But he is capable. He just lost it. I know he can get it back. I pray he can get it back. I, I that's that that's about Tell you what, I'm gonna do the best I can. All right. But remember, you know, help is always there in case he can't. Like, what do you mean? What are you, what are you talking about? I'm here to help. Any way I can. Okay? I don't know Just like this piece of wood. And what is that for? And why do you have a knife? Oh, I was just whittling. Okay. Fine. So, Danny, what do you hope to accomplish this weekend? I'm hoping to get our marriage out, back on track. That's what we're here for. Just like my wife would. But we're both on two ends of, you know, the spectrum here. We, you know, she thinks it's me. And I think it's her. A little bit of ravaging would go a long way with her. Ravage, ravage, ravage. She wants to be taken. She wants to, she. Wants to be taken. Okay. She wants to be taken! Well, you know what? If the woman would shut up and stop nagging me, maybe Well, haven't you thought of putting something in her mouth to quit nagging you. Well, I thought of that. Well, what's she think about that? She don't like that. See, she, she wants me to do all the work. No, I'm thinking of a number. She wants me 69. Yeah. No, no. She don't like that. She wants me to do all the work. Now listen, it's hard for a man to perform. When he is constantly putting, being put down. You gotta take her breasts, you gotta cup them firmly. Take her breast, listen to you. Listen to me! What has she been filling your ears with? You gotta kiss her. You gotta take your tongue. Kiss her, take my tongue You gotta run it down her belly, down her legs What about her (beep) tongue? Well, she's got a tongue. Listen, it goes both ways, doc. I don't know what she's been telling you on this camera here, but we both have needs. All right. You both have needs. Her need is for you to grab her by the (beep) Slap her down into bed and do her, in plain English. Well, like I said, doc, it's pretty damn hard to get in the mood, to get aroused, to get my blood going, to want to do what you're saying to my wife, with her nagging all the time and telling me what a piece of (beep) I am. Then don't be a piece of (beep). I am not, I'm not a piece of (beep). She may think I'm a piece of (beep). And you might even think I'm a piece of (beep). No, I just get the impression. Just cause I don't have a nine to five job doc doesn't mean I'm a piece of (beep), and I don't do my share in this marriage. I just get the impression that you're a lazy bum. Well, you got the wrong impression. So I just spoke to Danny and (clearing throat), he's stubborn. I keep telling him that Jackie just wants to be, felt loved and desired. And you know, he's not making that effort. Like you got a wife like that, she's hot as hell. Okay. I mean (laughter) I got wood! And he just doesn't see it that way. He says that he can't get it up because she keeps calling him a so and so and a lazy bum. I got news for you. If I had a wife that hot, I couldn't give a (beep) What she called me, I'd be on that thing. Like stink on (beep), all right? And, but I guess what we'll do now is we'll get them both in together and see if we can get them both to inch towards the middle. So two of you are here, let's try and get to some sort of amicable solution to this. Jackie, tell Danny what you told me, what you want from men. I want you to desire me. I want to feel loved. Desired. Hold it, Jackie, be a little more specific. So he understands what he has to do. Remember when we first met, and we started dating and you couldn't keep your hands off me. You used to, I used to walk in the room, you used to just push me up against the wall and caress me and kiss me and want me. You haven't done that in years. And, and I'm, and I'm kind of hurt by that. Well, things have changed. And if, you know, if you keep treating me, you know, like a piece of (beep) and calling me a piece of (beep), just because I don't have a regular nine to five job, and I go out to Atlantic City and I play cards. I throw a few dice every once in a while that I'm, I'm not, you know, I'm not, I'm less of a man. Maybe I will start acting like a man in the bedroom. And, and, and my, my, my juices will be, you know, won't have a problem getting my juices flowing for you. But, but you know, I, I can't, I can't perform under this kind of stress. Oh, but you expect me to pay for everything. The rest of our lives. Well why not? You make a pretty good living. Yeah, but I shouldn't, but you should provide with me too. We haven't gone away in years! Yeah, but you make enough money, you make enough money. Come on, Danny! Listen, I make money, you make money, but you make the, you make the money to pay the bills. And I go out and make a few bucks myself. And it's all for you. You don't do nothing. No, I bring the money home to you, honey. No you don't. I do. I do. No, you don't. I do. No you don't. Yes, I do. All right, Hey, look, we're not getting anywhere like this. Let me explain something to you. Pick up that piece of wood, Danny. Pick up the wood? Pick up the piece of wood What I gotta pick up the wood for? Pick up the wood, Danny. All right, I got the wood. What do you want me to do with it? Let's say that's your relationship. Okay? Yeah. Someday this could be your relationship. Wait, wait, what is that? How is that even possible? What the (beep) is he talking about? A lot of whittling. Lot of whittling. Now you whittle This, this is what I'm paying you $150 a session for, telling me about my, my piece of wood could be like this. I'm paying for this session. Not you. Oh that's Oh, there we go. She's paying for it, you're right. She's paying well, she's paying all the bills. So why not? What is she paying all this money for? So you can compare wood here? So you can ravage her like she wants to I came 200 miles up to your cabin so I can compare my wood to your wood? She wants you to strip her naked and do her. Yeah. Is that what she wants? Yeah. That's exactly what she wants. Is that what you want? Is that what you want? That's what I want! You want me to strip you naked? Exactly. Throw you up against the wall. Exactly. Well we're gonna end the session here. I'm hoping we made some progress and we'll leave you to your own devices, leaving you the cabin. Hopefully you make good use out of the time you spend with each other here. Remember, okay. You may not think that it's a big deal to her, this attention she craves, but it could save your marriage. And you just may make him see a different side of himself here, where he finds that it's worth it to try and please you. Whatever it is, don't waste this time that you've been given. So I'm gonna leave you the key to this cabin, along with a chilled bottle of champagne and a very comfortable bed upstairs. What you do with this weekend will determine your marriage. Don't waste this opportunity. Understand? Thank you, doctor. Yeah. Thanks a lot. (ominous music) So to keep track of how this couple is doing, I'm gonna, you know, check in on 'em from time to time. I have cameras mounted so I can check on their activities. I would like to think that they might be able to get through this. I just don't think so though. I just some, not this couple, it just doesn't seem like they're right for one another. I mean, I'm gonna try it the best I can. I have no idea where this is gonna end up, okay? Could end up going nowhere, it could end up being a disaster. I guess only time will tell, you know, but I'll be checking in on 'em. (lawn mower) [Frank] Can I help you? Frank DeMonico? [Frank] That's me. Who's asking? Barron Richards. I have a practice in town. Come in. [Frank] So what kind of a practice do you have, Mr. Richards? I'm a couple's counselor. Really? And here I thought I was the only therapist in Amityville. Yeah. Well, up until recently, I thought the same. [Frank] So how can I help you? You may remember a couple, Joe and Linda Martin came to see you last year about this time. She's a pretty redhead with tattoos. Oh, you're right, around Thanksgiving time last year. [Barron] Yep, exactly. Okay. Yeah. They were former clients of mine. (sigh) Seems [Frank] Why would they come to me? If they were clients of yours? Maybe they thought a different therapeutic approach would help. I don't know. Nevertheless, they haven't been seen since last Thanksgiving time. They came to see you. They seem to have disappeared. (laughing) I'm sure somebody else must have seen 'em in a year's time. [Barron] Nobody's gone on the record as saying such. So maybe they said something to you that would indicate what they were gonna be doing, where they were gonna be going. Were they leaving the country with anything? Any information No. Last time I saw them. They were walking merrily down that path towards their car. Well, maybe you could tell me what happened during your therapy. Did anything indicate that they were going to be leaving the area, leaving the state. [Frank] First off, anything that I interaction I had with them during therapy is highly confidential. You know that. I don't keep track of my clients like that. They see me once or twice and I never see them or hear from them again. I've done some looking into you since I've become aware of your being here. And I found that that also there are other couples who have gone disappearing since they've seen you. [Frank] Not uncommon. It just seems awful coincidental that couples come to see you and then no one hears from them again. [Frank] What are you saying, Mr. Richards? What I'm saying is that you may likely know something that you're not telling anybody. I don't know why the police didn't come to see you, but I'm coming to see you now. And I'm just asking. [Frank] And I told you, I don't know anything. Really? You know what? Mr. Richards, you're gonna come in my house and threaten me and threaten a man with a knife in his hand. Are you an idiot? Get outta my house. Get off my property. Don't ever come back on his property again. Do you understand me? [Barron] Okay. Get out. Okay. Do it your way right now. So what do you think? I don't know about this guy. I think he's a little crazy. Why? He's a little too obsessed with you. Maybe that's just his process. You know, you're always jealous. I think you're crazy. No, no, no, no. He goes into too much detail. He's talking about your curves and how you like to be ravished with the tongue and the fingers and the, he gets crazy. Well, this is what I told him. And this is, and this is why, and this is why we're here. Cuz we gotta, you know, we gotta work on this. I think that he's a little, I think you're little jealous. He's a little crazy here. Look at this. Look at this. He's probably burying bodies back here. Oh my God. You see what I mean? You're crazy! No, I'm not crazy. Look at this. You think of all these things. Come on. No. I did. I did get crazy. You're always jealous. You're always saying these stupid things. You never listen to me. Okay This guy is out of his mind. There's a reason for it. There's very strange things going on over here. I see a hole over there, could be dead bodies. God knows what's going on in this place. Come on, Danny. We're out in the middle of nowhere. Amityville. I never even heard of this place. That's the process Amityville This is a good place though. I don't know. Like I said, look at this place. Look at, look, look, look. It's not, it's obvious. He's not growing tomatoes back here. I mean, it could be a dozen dead bodies back here for all we know. Would you stop thinking that, dead bodies? Look at it. Look at this. Look at this. It's it's I can't even see back there. You're crazy Me as a man. I'm afraid to walk back there. You're nuts, you're crazy. Look at this. Look. Look at this. No, no, I'm not crazy. Yes you are, you're always crazy. Listen, listen honey, listen, honey, You're jealous, you're crazy This guy, this guy is out there. I'm telling you. Just relax. Oh, wait a minute. Look, look, what's this. What's this? What is that? Jesus, stop touching things. Oh aye aye aye, whoa boy oh boy. Oh, look at this. Oh my God! Look at this. Look at this! No, no, no, you are not bringing this in the house. I haven't played this game in years. No. It's bad luck Come on, Let's just bring it in the house NO! See what kind of demons we could drum up.

We're up here for the weekend. He's our therapist, yeah. Folks, folks. This man is not a licensed therapist. He is not a doctor. He is a dangerous, dangerous man. Whoa, whoa why should I believe you? You jump out in the bushes like you're a stalker, you scare the heck out of my wife. I don't know you from Adam. Last year, former patients of mine came here to see Dr. DeMonico, and they've not been seen since. He told me about those patients. And what did they tell? What did he tell you about that? He said they they're back together. No, no, no, no folks. They've not been seen since. No one has seen them in the past year. Since they were here last.

(screaming moans) Oh, oh that's it. Oh my God! (animalistic grunting) Danny. Danny! Danny! What happened to you? What happened? You don't remember? We had sex. No. It was the best sex ever. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm, I'm okay. I'm okay. Are you sure? Yeah. Yeah. I'm okay. [Phantom Voice] The gun is in the kitchen. Take the gun. Kill your wife. (grunting) Kill her. Shoot. Shoot. Shoot. (bang) (Jackie screaming) Danny! What the (beep)! Why do you have a gun? Get out! You have to come over, Danny's Danny has had a gun. Please, you have to come I don't know what to do. Should I call the police? (crying hysterically) Please, you gotta come, you gotta come quick! I'm so scared! Please help us! Okay, okay, thank you. Oh my God. What happened to you? You had a gun. You had a gun pointing at me. I called Dr. Frank, he's coming here. Okay? We don't know, you're lucky I didn't call the police. What the (beep) I, I don't know what, what happened? My God, Danny. I must have been sleepwalking or something. Sleepwalking? You never sleepwalk! I don't know what happened. I What is wrong with you? You had a gun pointed at my head. I, I, I, I don't know what happened. I gotta sleep in a hotel? Really? You're gonna make me go to a hotel. Danny just go. Okay. Whatever I have to do Doc. I'm so sorry. I didn't figure him to be that violent. No, I can't. I, I can't, I I'm still married to him. I, I still love him and I don't know what happened. All right. Well, I mean, you may not survive your marriage if that's the case. Look, I'm willing to stay here tonight. You know? I just want you to know that I'm here for you. Moral support. Even physical support if necessary. No, no, no, no, no. I'm still married. No, no, no, no, no. I'm still married. No. You were almost dead. Get out, get out. You don't want me to leave. Yes I do. I want you to get out. Get the (beep) out! So Danny came back with a shotgun. I kicked him out of there. Sent him to a motel. Things went according to plan. I tell you things are dropping right into place. (eerie sounds) So do you want to go or am I gonna go? I don't know. I mean, you seem to be the one with the most complaints about things. No, because you're online all day. I try and talk to you, and for some reason you're always on your phone. What is it with you and your phone? Posting all these pictures, doing duck faces. What is with you and these duck face pictures? You used to like my duck faces. Yes. But you don't give me duck faces in real life anymore. You only gimme duck faces in your pictures. I wanna see the duck faces in person. You remember when we had a great time together. We were always happy. And all of a sudden now I feel like you're just always on your phone, texting other people. What's going on? Who are you talking to? I'm not texting any other people, see that's the thing, you know, you just don't trust me anymore. I trust you. But the thing is though, remember when you met Carl Butler and you met up with him and you had that thing? You remember that. You thought I wouldn't let that go, didn't you? Yeah. I mean, that was, that was last year. And I thought we got through that. Well, we tried to, but now I see you on your phone all the time, it's making me think that you're making these pictures for somebody else. No, it's just, I don't know. It's just something to do. And it's like also something for the public too. They, they like it. You know? You like it too. I do, especially the shirtless ones. When you do all those muscles, I love the muscles. Yeah, but And I don't know why though, you've taken to having to shave all your body hair. What made you decide to do that? I used to like it when you were really hairy, all you got is a beard. Well, I mean, I don't know. I just Do you like it smooth or what is that about? Yeah. I mean, it's just, I wanted to try something different. But I don't like it. I don't know why you had to do that. That's half the reason I'm upset. Can you please grow it back? I mean, it's not gonna happen overnight, especially after the wax job, but you know. I know if you ever get, how do you say that electrolysis, if you ever get that you're out for good. You don't have to worry about electrolysis, Bitch, you better not! I told you, I want you hairy, we're bears. You're supposed to be hairy. Well, I mean, what have, what have we tried? I mean, what haven't we tried, that's a thing. Yeah, I mean, there was, you know, there was visiting where we first met, you know? And then the kink, you had all these kinky things you wanted to try, all those flavored lubes and everything that was your idea. You said flavored lubes. I mean only a couple of them I know. And some of them, some of them are really strange taste. I don't like 'em. And then, and then the thing you wanted to do with the, the whipping, you know, I'm not a fan of that. That hurts. Yeah, I don't, I didn't like that either. I just, well Why'd you think that was something that you wanted do? If you went through your whole life, never doing these things, I thought you wanted to do that. I didn't wanna do that. You're the one that said it was getting boring. It was getting boring, but I didn't want you to whip my hams. That's what you just didn't understand, I didn't want that. You've gone in this weird direction with our relationship, of doing all these strange things and that's not what I wanted. I wanted us to be the way we were when we first met, when we had true love. When you looked at me like, you love me now you look at me like you just want me out of the house. Now, that's the last thing I want. I want you. Oh, oh that you, you know, I love when you putting my hand on your tummy, I rub it like Santa Claus. Yeah (laughing) Whoa, ho, ho, ho doesn't know, ho, ho, ho. Saint Nick's ghost, right, you know! Tell me what you want for Christmas and everything. Yes, I know. I know. Yeah, we used to do that. What are you doing? Getting a little. Well, I was just holding your hand cause you know, I just want you to know that I guess therapy's working already. I'm still here for you. Thank you. I appreciate it. And I want us to be back to, you know. The way things were. Yeah. But also just better than the way it was because you know, the way it was before is, that's why we're here now. I know that's what we want. We want it to be the way it was. So that's what we want doctor to be the way it was before. Yeah. I just told you what we expected to go the way it was before. And we want you to help us Or better than the way it was before or better, better than it was before. Amazing. We, we loved each other. Everything was perfect. And I feel like it's starting to get like that again. Yeah, maybe. I mean, doctor, I think we might have to take a little trip to the, you know, the back room or something. Do you have a back room or anything in here? No. No. Why do you wanna talk to Enrique? As we, I told you, we gotta go in the back. You want to talk to him alone? I can talk to him and then, you know, we can. All right But wait, wait minute. Why? I miss you though. I miss you too, baby. I, I'll be back. All right. Okay. Okay. I, I know, I know we found love again. I love him. I mean, there's always like, I don't know. Sometimes it just seemed like, you know, does he even like, still look at me the same way sometimes? And then of course, you know, something just happens where, you know, we just, we just find other things to fall in love with each other again. I mean that whole Carl Butler situation, it wasn't, wasn't necessarily like cheating. I mean, it's you know, just letting somebody eat your (beep) Is not necessarily cheating. You know, eating ain't cheating as Bill Clinton once said. Right? Of course. I mean, I mean, yeah, I'm a man. I I'm, I look at other guys, so yeah, but they're not, they're not him. They're not. Yeah. I'm still in love with him. Yeah. I mean, we haven't really talked about it much, but I mean, I was thinking about it, but it just never came up. Doctor, where is Enrique? You know, he never came home yesterday. So are you with him? Did he leave me for you? What is going on? Where is he? [Female Voice] If you're No, but I need to know where he is, okay. He wouldn't just disappear like this, his phone is off. I can't get in touch with him. If you've done something, I'm gonna go to the police. Come and find me and do what? So now, so this threats makes me think that you did do something to Enrique. So where is Enrique? Where is he? [Female Voice] Did he have a heart attack? No. (ominous music & screaming) Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. And what was with that gay couple? You know, I don't have the kind of skills that that takes to counsel people like that. First off, I don't even know, you know, how they act amongst themselves. I'll tell you this much though, that Enrique he's a big boy, a lot of meat on those bones, right? So I couldn't help, you know, using him for something. And I, so I took Jeremy, killed him off and used him to stuff Enrique. And it was enough meat left over there for two Thanksgivings. I put half in the freezer and I'm gonna tell you what, it was still good the following year. Can't run out of food. I'll tell you, it's just there for you, man. It's better than going to a supermarket. (ominous music) (high pitched gibberish) What the (beep)? (high pitched gibberish) As far as finding that Turkey costume, (laughter) That was a leftover for when the Martins were here. Tried to use that as some sort of therapy, it didn't work out well. And you know, first off, Mr. Martin was a pain in the ass. So I beat him to death with a stick, like I say, and just the flesh just rolled right off him. And his wife, what a pain in the ass she was. She wanted no part of carrying any demon spawn or anything of that nature. So I had no choice, but to just kill her and devour her. You might say they both became Thanksgiving dinner. So, you know, I hope they appreciated the balloon reference. As far as everybody else, I didn't need that until these two came along. You know, a sexless, couple. (laughter) Sexless couple. Try to have sex wearing a Turkey outfit. It didn't work out for the Wells or. the Martins. And I don't think it was gonna work out well for these other two either. Doctor Frank, please, please come back. I'm I'm I'm seeing things. I'm hearing things. I need you to come back, please. Just, just come back. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that I, I was just seeing things all day. I checked upstairs. There's nothing up there. I saw her, I saw her And you just went through a traumatic experience night. You might see things that aren't even there. I know you had a traumatic experience night, which might make you see things, but there's nothing there. Okay Look I believe you. I'm here for you. Okay. Here for you physically, mentally. Thank you. Why don't I take you to bed? Would you like me to take you to bed? Okay Well, why don't you go upstairs and Okay. Get undressed. I'll be up soon. Okay. All right? (ominous music) (moaning and screaming) And of course, you know, after Danny left for the motel, which he had to go I had this outrageous sex with his wife, somebody who hadn't had decent sex for a long, long time, I stuck my tongue in there for, she was screaming like a banshee, and she climbed on top of me and damn near ripped my flesh apart. Talk about turning the tables! And then, when it was all over, you know, I, I was relieved to be able to know that I put my demon seed inside of her. And she was so gratified for the sex that she just laid there and smiled and clutched on to me. And we ended up doing it again, you know, as many times as we could, before I finally passed out, gave into the darkness and rode me for dear life. And now she'll be part of that darkness, as my seed's firmly implanted inside of her, she's carrying my successor, I would like to think. (crying) What, did I do? I cheated on my husband I said I wasn't gonna do it (crying hysterically) What did I do, what did I do? Oh my God! What the (beep) did I do? What the (beep) did I do? OK, Jackie, what did you do? What did you do? Okay, just relax, relax, relax, relax. You're gonna be fine. You're gonna be fine. (screaming) (ominous music) [Jackie] What are you doing in here? Danny? What did you do to my husband? I didn't do anything. He's one of us now. He played with the Ouija board. Shouldn't have. [Jackie] What are you talking about? He's no longer your husband. I am. [Jackie] Danny. Make him stop. Did you enjoy the bliss that we had? I left you with a little something. Demon spawn, that's growing inside of you. It's gonna make me immortal. I'm gonna live forever, thanks to you. Be strong. Take care of this baby. As soon you're gonna be part of us too. Every Thanksgiving I take some souls. Last year was the Martins. Oh yeah, I think you met her. She was the girl in the shower. Last year was the Martins, this year it's you and Danny. And next year it'll be someone else. So I hope you enjoyed the bliss, but not to worry. You'll live forever. [Jackie] No! (wind blowing, muted screams) No! (screaming) Doctor Barron. You know, I gave him a friendly warning to stay away from the property and he just couldn't do it. He wanted to cause me problems. Well, he ended up with the problems, okay? I have his jaw mounted somewhere on the wall. I dunno whether to use it as a coat rack or what. The rest of him? Ah, we all know what happened to the rest of him. He's part of the legacy that's buried out here somewhere. And I gotta tell you something. I made sure it was agonizing to him. He didn't go quickly and I wanted to make him suffer. (door squeaking) (stairs creaking) Got you this time you son of a (beep). Mr. Richards. Hello, Frank. You're just in time for dinner. We have some unfinished business. You and I. I don't think so. No? No. I know for a fact that the Martins never left this house. Really? Yes. I wanna know what you did to them. You got me. You got me. Well, let me tell you something. The husband, I beat him to death with a stick twice this size. To the point that the skin just rolled off his bones like fricassee. The wife, oh, she was a real firecracker. She was, but she wouldn't stay pregnant with my demon sperm. So I ended up filleting her and having her for dinner. Boy, I gotta tell you she was tasty. I always saved the best for last. (dramatic music) You're out of your (beep) mind! I'm calling the cops. I don't think so. Get him. What the (beep)? (wet slap) (loud moaning) (news intro music) This just in our next topic today is on a local doctor Who's now missing in action after being named the suspect in a series of disappearances spanning several years. This doctor is Frank DeMonico, and he is a resident of Amityville. And he has been in practice for decades. Now he was allegedly was the last person to see multiple couples who were patients of his and was said to have seen them at appointments shortly before they went missing. No bodies have ever been found no evidence and no formal charges, but we do have witnesses who claim to know the truth. One man who requested not to be named said in a recent private interview that he and his girlfriend, twenty-three year old Petra Smart, went for multiple sessions with this doctor and that he grew increasingly more creepy with each visit. Hmm. This gets really interesting. He says that the doctor asked for them to start doing solo sessions and that Petra went twice alone. He, however, never went by himself. The first time she returned saying that she felt the couple should stop going altogether and that it was just not working out with the doctor's methods. The boyfriend agreed. And he is quoted as saying the doctor made him feel incredibly uncomfortable. And his questionings were bordering on perverted with how he spoke to them. Somehow the doctor allegedly convinced Petra to return to discuss something in her file alone. And she was never heard from again. When police spoke with Dr. Frank DeMonico, he stated that she never showed up for her appointment. Without any further proof of it, she was there or not. And after a brief investigation, he was left to continue his business. But it continues. There was one last interaction that this man claims happened before he never heard from the doctor again. He states that someone sounding like the doctor called him from an unlisted number saying that they had gutted his girl and would strangle him with her insides if he ever called him. When asked what the man did about this, he quoted to say that he believed him. And to this day, fears running into him. Hey guys, there's something I need to tell you. My girlfriend Petra has been gone for days now. And I think I know the reason why. So me has some, you know, me and my girlfriend has not been doing great. And we went to meet this guy, named Frank DeMico, whatever his name is for marriage counselor, cuz we haven't been doing good. And I noticed that he was, you know, touch her. And I told my girlfriend, we need to leave. She didn't notice. So we came back home, but she decided to go back to meet that guy. And so she came back home all of a sudden I'm she hasn't texted me for days and I've tried calling her, text, I went to her place, nothing. So I tried everything until one day I got a message from, from her as I thought. What I find out is that it's from that Frank, on the phone, he said he was gonna do things to her. He was gonna kill her. I went to the police, told them everything. The voicemail, nothing. They even went to his place and they didn't find him or her. So Petra, if you're out there. I hope you are okay. I'll find you. I will. I love you. And anyone who's seeing this, please spread this around. Everyone needs to know about this guy. His name is Frank DeMicro, Damico. Whatever. If you find that son of a (beep), you kill him. Goodbye. Hmm. Funny thing is, this is one of several people who claim that this doctor is responsible, but unfortunately the only people who have proof are still missing and at this time, so is he. It's your old buddy Frank again, as you can see, I'm not doing too good these days. Even those of us who live in the dark side sooner or later, you know, age, end up leaving this planet. But all the fun I've had all the bodies that I've buried around here. I don't know, twenty, thirty? I dunno, you lose track after a while. Yeah. And even the ones that didn't die the way I normally would've expected like that, that Jackie, that couldn't hang onto my demon spawn and that useless husband of hers, Danny, that outlived his usefulness the first night. And then that, that pesky doctor, whatever his name was. Okay. They're all gone all buried, all around here. Some I beat some I ate, you know, if it's all in the realm of things, right? That was my demonic nature to do stuff like that. And I'm gonna miss not being around to do more of it. You know, it's, it's like, my job is not done, but unfortunately I'm not gonna be here to finish it. I'm just hoping somebody else out there is as devious as I am, to pick up on what I did, cuz I left a legacy here. Just somebody has to pick up that, pick up the stick and keep going with it. You know, not just to whittle it like I used to do to, but to beat people with it. All right. And I'm gonna tell you what. When that day comes, watch out world because you know, whoever it is, is gonna be in a lot better shape than I am right now. And they're gonna finish the job. (ominous music) (papers rustling) [Male Voice] Now it's that show, I'm gonna get this son of a (beep) Frank, I'm gonna get you. When did this come? Yesterday. Oh my God. Frank's got my daughter. He's got my daughter on a video tape. He's taunting me. Oh my God. Jack, my pesky reporter friend. I'm saving the best for last. You know that darling daughter of yours, Stephanie. Oh, I gotta tell you, boy, she is a mouthful. What a morsel! Are you a religious man? Jack? You know, remember Jesus' last meal. Stephanie's gonna be my last meal. And I'm gonna savor every bite of her, every morsel, I'm gonna be licking my lips in between. And I'll eventually send you a little something in the mail. I'll send you an email of this tape, but I'll also send you a little something in the mail to remember her by, the part that I don't want to eat. You know? Cause certain things just, eh, oh, maybe I'll send you some intestines or something. I don't know. A little something to remember her by, but that'd be that Jack. It's almost time for her to be here. Oh boy, lunch. She should be here soon. Good thing I didn't eat this morning. I want to save my appetite. I'm sure she's coming, sooner or later. (birds chirping) Eugene Tolerance here. Tonight, we'll be discussing a local columnist named Jack Tolerance. No relation. Supposedly he got too close to the story he was chasing. Now this man was highly respected and had tons of followers. So thus it should serve as a cautionary tale for all of you investigators that are fly by night. He was going after the story of a local therapist, Frank DeMonico. This guy has tons of bad press. No matter what he does, his reviews are the worst of the worst. And even though he's got multiple and I mean multiple police investigations going on astonishingly his practice is still open. So Jack tried anything he could to break the story. In fact, allegedly even having his own daughter, can you believe that, his own daughter pose as a patient in order to bait this guy out. Regardless of how Mr. Tolerance's daughter wound up involved in this situation, she came up missing and the doctor is still missing as well. I cannot get away from the fact that this just screams paranormal, especially in Amityville, it's always intrigued me. I have a ton of theories. I'd love to hear you guys' feedback, but it boils down to, I think the bastard is possessed. That is my professional opinion speaking. Tolerance out. Hello. My name is Grant Haines. I was hired by Dr. Barron Richards to investigate therapist Frank DeMonico. What I found was shocking and proves that Frank DeMonico is responsible for the deaths of Barron Richards and several others. At first he seemed like a normal couple's therapist, but once I really got close to this case, I saw him commit many many horrible and unsafe practices. His clients have gone missing. He convinces these women to commit sexual acts with him. And first the husbands disappear. Then next, the wife ends up missing too. I told Dr. Richards to stay away from the cabin in Amityville, but, (beep) he wouldn't listen. He's been missing for a year. And I believe I have proof that it was Frank DeMonico. Frank had skipped town and packed up all his files and abandoned the cabin. Shocking. Hmm. But I searched the cabin and found something under the floorboards. He left face behind. It seems that he recorded everything without patients being aware. He's a sick, sick, twisted old man. But he had recordings of himself having sex with female patients. I have to stop for a moment. The look in his eyes. He looked like he knew I would find these tapes. He has a lot of VHS tapes. I gotta warn you this next part. It's gonna be very graphic. I do have proof though. That Frank DeMonico is the murderer. One of these tapes. He has a man slowly being tortured to his death. The man's jaw is missing and he cannot talk or scream for help. The painful moans are disturbing. He's unrecognizable, but I believe this man is Barron Richards. I will be going through these tapes. I will be sending it to the proper authorities to help find Frank DeMonico. Hey Frank! (chuckling) I know you're out there. You you, Hm. You sick old bastard! You better hope they find you before I do. Hey guys. I know I haven't been on in a while and then I usually don't post anything serious. Usually I'm on here gaming and I took a break and I, I didn't really want to talk to anybody about it, but my sister's been missing. Her husband is actually a suspect right now and they can't find him either. I, I guess what everyone is saying is that it's usually the spouse, but I don't really believe it. Now don't get me wrong. They had problems. They actually were going to counseling. They were both hotheaded. I can't say that I ever saw him be abusive to her. In fact, she was even really more aggressive, not really bad. They were a pretty normal couple. Just having a really hard time. It's, it's been crazy for them, with everything going on privately and my family. And so they, they did the right thing by going to therapy, really urban legend kind of stuff, or gossip or bar stories. But I guess there were some other people that went missing after seeing this counselor or whatever you wanna call him. My sister and I weren't close for a really long time, but she did reach out about them possibly getting separated. And I feel res responsible because I really pushed her to do the therapy route. But that's the thing, the therapist that they were seeing, I, I don't know, but he had a really bad reputation, Not anything concrete, but there's a lot of rumors, but he still had the highest rated business where they live. And, and during the process of looking, he just won them over. She said something about this family showing up. She wasn't sure, but it was kind of weird to begin with. And, and then people just dropping by. She said it was going good, but the guy was pretty creepy. And then she left a voicemail for me. And I felt so bad. I can't be any more angry myself because I didn't get back to her right away. And that call, she said she had a really bad feeling and that her husband was acting really, really weird, but happy Thanksgiving. And she would call me when they got back and she never did. Now, no one has any answers, her husband and now the doctor are all missing. Apparently there's another doctor reported missing from the area. I think he's someone who they originally interviewed to do the therapy or they met. I'm not sure about that either. I just don't know what else to do. And I'm up to all night thinking about this. I, if anyone has any information about that area over in Amityville or any of these doctors, or if you know my sister, just please private message me. My family and I, I are horrified. We can't go through another Thanksgiving without any information. So please, and thank you guys. Thank you. (ominous music)
