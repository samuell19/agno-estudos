I'D PLANNED TO COME UP HERE WITH A FRIEND OF MINE, LARCH A-TAS-KA-NAY. THIS WAS HIS HOME COUNTRY. BUT THEN ONE NIGHT ON PATROL, THERE WAS A MORTAR SHELL. (explosion echoes) WELL, I HADN'T COME HERE TO LOOK BACK. THERE WAS SOMETHING I HAD TO DO-- FIND LARCH'S FATHER. HE WAS THE CHIEF OF A SMALL TRIBE OF INDIANS CALLED THE TAKLUTES. THEY HAD A SETTLEMENT ON THE SHORES OF WHITE BIRD LAKE. OLIVER RED FERN'S STORE. I KNEW ABOUT OLIVER-- A COLLEGE MAN WHO'D RETURNED TO SERVE HIS PEOPLE. HELLO THERE. SAM EAGLE SPEAKER. I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT HIM, BUT I'D LEARN. HELLO. CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE I'LL FIND MR. A-TAS-KA-NAY? - ARE YOU SOME KIND OF GOVERNMENT MAN OR SOMETHING? - NO. WHY? WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH PETER A-TAS-KA-NAY? - WELL, I WAS A FRIEND OF HIS SON, LARCH A-TAS-KA-NAY. WE WERE IN THE SAME OUTFIT IN THE ARMY. - I AM HIS FATHER. - I'M BOB LESLIE, SIR. LARCH AND I WERE FRIENDS. THESE ARE HIS THINGS, SIR. THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE 'EM. I'M SORRY, SIR. I'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT THIS PLACE, I THOUGHT I'D LIKE TO STAY HERE A WHILE. DO SOME CAMPING. - I'M A LICENSED GUIDE. SKIFFING OUTBOARD, TACKLE. 30-30 FOR HUNTING. PLENTY OF MOOSE, ELK, COUGAR. 15 BUCKS A DAY. YOU FURNISH THE GRUB. - NO HUNTING FOR ME. JUST A LITTLE FISHING. - I'VE GOT AN OLD CABIN OVER AT NUGGET CREEK. IT'S A FEW MILES UP THE LAKE. NEEDS SOME FIXING, BUT I'LL RENT IT TO YOU FOR 30 BUCKS FOR THE SEASON. - SOUNDS FINE. - THERE'S SALMON AND STEELHEAD IN THE CREEK. LITTLE GOLD TOO, IF YOU WANT TO PAN FOR IT. WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IT? - NO, I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT. - YOU'LL NEED A CANOE. SAM HERE WILL RENT IT TO YOU. - 15 BUCKS. - HE'LL TAKE TEN. - (sighs) ALL RIGHT. TEN. - I'LL NEED SOME GROCERIES TOO. - OKAY, WHAT'LL YOU NEED? - UH, GIVE ME SOME BEANS. SIDE OF BACON. SOME COFFEE. YEAH, SOME HONEY. DURING MY TRIP ACROSS THE LAKE, I REMEMBERED HOW LARCH ALWAYS SAID THAT FOR A COUPLE OF STRUNG-OUT VETS, THE WHITE BIRD WOULD BE GOOD MEDICINE, AND ALREADY I WAS BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HE MEANT. I GOT A NEW LIFT OUT OF THE FIRST MOOSE I'D EVER SEEN. AND A WOLF. AND A COUGAR. I STARTED THINKING ABOUT MYSELF AGAIN WHEN I SAW THE COW ELK. SHE WAS RUNNING AWAY TOO, ONLY SHE KNEW WHERE SHE WAS GOING. I DIDN'T. THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO BE ALONE FOR A WHILE. MAYBE I COULD FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WITH THE REST OF MY LIFE. BUT ANSWERS WERE IN THE FUTURE. THAT FIRST DAY, I WAS JUST FEELING GOOD ABOUT THE WHOLE SCENE. THEN I GOT MY FIRST LOOK AT OLIVER RED FERN'S CABIN. WELL, IT WASN'T MUCH, BUT IT WAS HOME, AND IT HAD OCCUPANTS TO PROVE IT. A FAMILY OF RACCOONS. (raccoons chattering) ANYBODY ELSE? ALL RIGHT, CHECK OUT TIME. EVERYBODY OUT. COME ON. GET. JUST CLEANING OUT TOOK THE BETTER PART OF SEVERAL DAYS. AND AFTER THAT CAME THE PATCHING UP. WHAT WITH ONE THING AND ANOTHER, IT WAS ALMOST A WEEK BEFORE I FIRST SAW... THE BEARS. RIGHT AWAY, I LEARNED SOMETHING. BLACK BEARS AND BROWN BEARS ARE THE SAME BEARS. THEY'RE JUST DIFFERENT COLOR PHASES. THE VERY NEXT MORNING, I WAS GOING AFTER SOME FRESH FISH FOR BREAKFAST. BUT THE ABANDONED SLUICE BOX ALONG NUGGET CREEK GAVE ME A MILD CASE OF GOLD FEVER. THERE WAS A LITTLE COLOR SHOWING, AND I COULD RECOGNIZE GOLD WHEN I SAW IT. I SHOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED TROUBLE WHEN I SAW IT TOO, BUT I DIDN'T. HELLO, GUYS. WAIT A MINUTE. DON'T RUN OFF. (bear growls) HO! (growls) I JUST LEARNED A CARDINAL RULE FOR BEAR COUNTRY-- DON'T EVER GET BETWEEN A MOTHER BEAR AND HER CUBS. GOLD PANNING NETTED ME A HALF HOUR'S WAGES IN TWO DAYS OF WORKING. ON THE THIRD DAY, I HAD A VISITOR. MR. A-TAS-KA-NAY. HELLO. COME IN. - NO, YOU COME. I HAVE SOMETHING. MY SON'S. YOU USE THEM, MAYBE. - YES, YOU BET I CAN, BUT... - HE WAS YOUR FRIEND. - WELL, I APPRECIATE THAT. I--I CERTAINLY DO. JUST A MINUTE. I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU TOO. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. MR. A-TAS-KA-NAY? NO, I-- I WANT YOU TO HAVE IT. MR. A-TAS-KA-NAY... A HANDSHAKE WAS THE ONLY WAY I KNEW TO REACH OUT TO THAT OLD MAN. HE WANTED ME TO TALK ABOUT LARCH. I COULD SENSE THAT. BUT HE COULDN'T BEAR TO LISTEN. SOMEWHERE I'D HEARD THAT WILDLIFE IS BORN TAME AND MADE WILD BY PEOPLE. THAT'S IT. COME HERE. COME ON. GOOD. LITTLE BIT MORE. HERE'S SOME GOOD SALT. COME ON. (distant gunfire) (gunfire) HUNTERS. THEN IT HIT ME. THE BEARS. JUDGING BY THE SOUND, THE SHOOTING HAD BEEN IN THE BEAR FAMILY'S TERRITORY. SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS, I'D SEEN THEM AROUND HERE. BUT THEY WERE IN NONE OF THE FAMILIAR PLACES. (motor whirs) SAM EAGLE SPEAKER AND SOME OF HIS SPORTSMEN. THEY'D KILLED THE MOTHER. BUT WHAT ABOUT HER CUBS? (suspenseful music) ♪ ♪ (bears mewling) POOR LITTLE GUYS. NOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO YOU? WHO'S GONNA TAKE CARE OF YOU? HO, BOY. GUESS I'M ELECTED. FIRST THING I GOT TO DO IS FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET YOU DOWN OUT OF THERE. LOOK, HOLD EVERYTHING. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. THE WAY TO THEIR HEARTS MIGHT BE THROUGH THEIR STOMACHS, AND SINCE I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT BEAR CUBS ATE, I JUST MIXED UP A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING. COME AND GET IT. (bears calling) ALL RIGHT. (bears sniffing) (suspenseful music) ♪ ♪ EASY NOW. EASY. IT'S ALL RIGHT. EASY. RELAX, FELLAS. I'M NOT GONNA HURT YOU. MAYBE THOSE CUBS DIDN'T LIKE ME, BUT THEY SURE LIKED MY COOKING, SO A SECOND HELPING MIGHT JUST BRING THEM AROUND. (bears mewling) AND IT DID. WELL, COME ON IN. HEY, HEY, HEY. WHAT'S ALL THIS? IT'S ALL RIGHT. JUST SETTLE DOWN NOW. EASY. CALM DOWN. NO ONE'S GONNA HURT YOU. EASY. YOU GOT IT. THAT'S IT. EASY. ALL RIGHT, NOW. IT'S ALL RIGHT. NOBODY'S GONNA HURT YOU. THE LITTLE GUYS HAD COME HERE EXPECTING FOOD, AND I WASN'T GONNA DISAPPOINT THEM. I'D JUST CALM THEM DOWN, PROVE I WAS THEIR FRIEND. COME ON. YUM, YUM, YUM. COME ON. IT'S ONLY ME. I'M NOT GONNA HURT YOU. COME ON. COME ON. JUST A LITTLE TASTE, HUH? COME ON. COME ON. COME ON. (bears yelping) THAT'S IT. COME ON. YEAH, COME ON. THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT. YEAH. GOOD, HUH? (snarls) OW! NUTS. THE BEARS AND I SPENT ALL DAY COOPED UP IN THE CABIN, AND THAT NIGHT I WAS STILL TRYING TO WIN THEM OVER. IT SEEMED THOSE ORPHANS FELT ALL THEY HAD WAS EACH OTHER. STILL SCARED, AREN'T YOU? YOU GUYS GOT TO START TRUSTING ME PRETTY SOON. MAYBE I WAS PUSHING THEM A LITTLE TOO HARD. THE THING TO DO WAS TO PLAY IT COOL AND WAIT. MEANTIME, MIGHT AS WELL GIVE THEM SOME NAMES. THE LITTLE GUY WITH THE NERVOUS ITCH JUST HAD TO BE SCRATCH. THE BLACK CUB WITH THE WHITE PATCH WAS NATURALLY PATCH. THE LITTLE BROWN GUY WAS A LITTLE BROWN GIRL. I CALLED HER RUSTY. IT TURNED OUT TO BE PATCH THAT MADE THE FIRST FRIENDLY MOVE. AT THAT MOMENT, IN SOME MYSTICAL SORT OF WAY, A BOND WAS FORMED. IT WOULD SOON COME TO INCLUDE THE OTHERS, BUT IT WOULD ALWAYS BE A LITTLE STRONGER BETWEEN PATCH AND ME. THAT NIGHT, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE, I HAD A FAMILY. THE NEXT DAY, I BEGAN MY NEW CAREER AS A MOTHER BEAR. I PLANNED TO DO ONLY WHAT SHE WOULD HAVE DONE-- TEACH THE CUBS TO BE SELF SUFFICIENT, AND THAT WOULD TAKE SOME DOING. WITH THOSE LITTLE CRITTERS, LEARNING CAME SECOND. FUN CAME FIRST. THE ONE THING THEY DID LIKE MORE THAN PLAYING WAS EATING, SO THEY HAD TO LEARN WHAT WAS ACCEPTABLE CUB GRUB. LIKE A PORCUPINE ISN'T, BUT SALMONBERRIES ARE. KIDS, I GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU. COME ON. LOOK, LOOK. AFTER GRADUATING FROM BERRIES, WE MOVED ON TO THE PROTEIN COURSE-- GRUBS AND BEETLES. WHERE TO FIND THEM AND HOW TO GET THEM. SEE, RIGHT HERE. YEAH, HOW'S THAT TASTE? DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS, THE CUBS RANGED A LITTLE FARTHER ON EACH TRAINING TRIP. THEN ONE DAY THEY GOT OUT OF SIGHT AND INTO TROUBLE. AN ELK CALF. THE WAY THE CUBS SAW IT, A POSSIBLE PLAYMATE. BUT THE CALF DIDN'T SEE IT THAT WAY. HEY, YOU GUYS. (elk growling) HEY, WHOA! STOP THAT! HEY! COME ON. JUST GET OUT OF HERE. (elk snorts) ALL RIGHT, GET OUT OF HERE. GO ON. SHOO. GO ON. SHOO! RUSTY? PATCH? (bears mewling) COME HERE, RUSTY. COME ON. HEY, HI, RUSTY. COME HERE. COME HERE. AW, COME HERE, BABY. COME HERE. COME HERE. COME HERE. WELL, I HOPE YOU LEARNED YOUR LESSON. LIFE WITH THE CUBS WASN'T ALL TRAINING AND TROUBLE.

(laughs) YEP, EVERYTHING SEEMED TO BE ON AN EVEN KEEL. BUT IT WASN'T GONNA STAY THAT WAY. THIS TIME THE CREW STAYED IN LINE. IT WAS THE SKIPPER WHO HAD THE HANG UP. DOGGONE IT. WHOA!

(bears yammering) BASIC TRAINING FOR THE CUBS WAS OFTEN AS NOT AN EDUCATION FOR ME TOO. IN ONE CASE IN ONE DAY IN ONE LESSON WE ALL LEARNED ABOUT THE TOUGHEST ANIMAL IN THE WILDERNESS-- THE WOLVERINE. BEING OUTNUMBERED DOESN'T WORRY A WOLVERINE.

THOSE BEARS COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED. - YOU LIVE HERE, MY FRIEND, YOU GOT A LOT TO LEARN. OUR TRIBE IS A BEAR TRIBE. THE BEAR IS OUR BROTHER. - AND YOU DON'T CARE IF YOUR BROTHERS ARE KILLED? - OUR PEOPLE BELIEVE IT IS BETTER TO BE KILLED THAN TO BE CAPTURED. - I DIDN'T CAPTURE THEM. THEIR MOTHER WAS SHOT. THEY WERE HELPLESS. I'M ONLY TRYING TO PROTECT THEM UNTIL THEY CAN TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES. - OR UNTIL HE CAN SELL 'EM FOR A GOOD PRICE. - NOW WAIT A MINUTE. - ANYTHING A WHITE MAN DOES, HE DOES FOR MONEY. CARTRIDGES. - SAM, YOU BEEN BOOZING IT UP? - I SAID CARTRIDGES, NOT WHISKEY. OUR BROTHERS WILL BE FREE! - HOLD IT! (gunfire) (both grunting) (dog barking) - (speaking native language) - LOOK, MR. A-TAS-KA-NAY. THIS MAN IS EITHER DRUNK OR CRAZY. HE WAS TRYING TO SHOOT MY CUBS. HE ALREADY SHOT THEIR MOTHER. - THAT'S A LIE. WE WERE HUNTING ELK. - (speaking native language) SIR, I BEEN TRYING TO EXPLAIN, BUT NO ONE WANTS TO UNDERSTAND. I'M ONLY TRYING TO PROTECT THESE CUBS. - THEN WHY DO YOU TIE THEM? - I HAD TO BRING THEM WITH ME. I COULDN'T LEAVE THEM BY THEMSELVES. - A BEAR IS NOT A DOG. A BEAR SHOULD BE FREE. - THEY WILL BE. JUST AS SOON AS THEY'RE OLD ENOUGH. - WHAT YOU'VE DONE IS WRONG. - HOW IS IT WRONG? - YOU ANGERED THE GREAT SPIRIT. IT IS HE WHO WATCHES OVER THE BEARS. NOT YOU. - THE GREAT SPIRIT DIDN'T DO TOO WELL BY THEIR MOTHER. MR. A-TAS-KA-NAY, CERTAINLY YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT THESE BEARS ARE TOO-- - NO, IT IS YOU WHO ARE TOO YOUNG. THE YOUNG HAVE LOST ALL RESPECT. TAKE THOSE BEARS BACK WHERE YOU FOUND THEM. SET THEM FREE. - MR. A-TAS-KA-NAY, PLEASE. - ENOUGH. THIS IS AN EVIL DAY. BAD THINGS WILL COME FOR OUR PEOPLE. - (sighs) I WAS SORRY THAT OLD PETER WAS ANGRY, BUT INDIAN SUPERSTITION WOULDN'T CHANGE MY PLANS FOR THE CUBS. NOT TILL THEY WERE READY, ANYWAY. DO YOU MIND?

WHY DO THEY DISAPPEAR EVERY TIME ONE OF OUR PEOPLE COMES HERE TO TALK TO THEM? - I'M SORRY, COMMISSIONER. I GUESS I'M IN THE DARK. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. - WELL, HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN STAYING HERE? - ABOUT TWO MONTHS. - I SEE. YOU GET ALONG WELL WITH THEM? - WELL, YES AND NO. UH, RIGHT NOW, CERTAINLY NOT WITH CHIEF A-TAS-KA-NAY, BUT I GET ALONG ALL RIGHT WITH OLIVER RED FERN. BY THE WAY, HAVE YOU TRIED HIS STORE? THERE'S ALWAYS-- - WE TRIED IT. NOT A SOUL IN SIGHT. - THAT'S VERY STRANGE. - OH, NO, IT'S NOT. OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS, I'VE BEEN UP HERE HALF DOZEN TIMES, AND I END UP LOOKING AT THE TREES OR A STRAY DOG. - I'M STILL VERY MUCH IN THE DARK. WOULD YOU MIND-- - OH, NOT AT ALL. IT'S NO SECRET. NEXT SPRING WE'RE SENDING A CREW UP HERE TO START CONSTRUCTION. THIS WHOLE AREA IS GONNA BE A NATIONAL PARK. - A NATIONAL PARK? HERE? - IT'S GOVERNMENT PROPERTY. IT'S NOT A RESERVATION. THERE'S A BIG NEED FOR RECREATIONAL AREAS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. WE CAN'T COME UP WITH 'EM FAST ENOUGH. - I SEE. AND WHEN THE PARK MOVES IN, THE INDIANS HAVE TO MOVE OUT. IS THAT IT? - EXACTLY. THESE THINGS ARE NEVER PLEASANT FOR EITHER SIDE, BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO SIT DOWN WITH THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AND DISCUSS THE MATTER. - BUT IF THE INDIANS HAVE NO CHOICE, WHAT'S THERE TO TALK ABOUT? - OH, THERE'S A LOT TO TALK ABOUT. FOR ONE THING, WE'D LIKE TO TAKE SOME OF THE ELDERS UP TO THUNDERBIRD LAKE WHERE WE HAVE A RESERVE FOR THEM. BELIEVE ME, THE TAKLUTES WILL HAVE EVERYTHING THEY HAVE HERE, PLUS A GREAT DEAL MORE. - WE'RE NOT ASKING YOU TO PLEAD OUR CASE, JUST PUT IN SOME KIND OF A WORD FOR US, SO THAT WE CAN ESTABLISH CONTACT WITH THEM. - I'M AFRAID YOU'RE ASKING THE WRONG MAN. BUT IF THE RIGHT MOMENT EVER COMES, I'LL MENTION IT TO OLIVER RED FERN. - WELL, FAIR ENOUGH. WE CAN'T ASK FOR ANY MORE THAN THAT, CAN WE, JOHN? - CERTAINLY CAN'T. - WE BETTER GET MOVING. THANK YOU FOR THE HOSPITALITY, MR. LESLIE. - MY PLEASURE, COMMISSIONER. - YOU DO MAKE GOOD COFFEE. - HEY, HOW ABOUT MY BISCUITS? - (laughs) - (speaking native language) - THERE WAS AN OLD ROOT CELLAR NEAR THE CABIN, AND I FIGURED I'D BETTER STASH THE CUBS THERE DURING MY NEXT TRIP TO THE SETTLEMENT. COME ON. DOWN HERE. LET'S GO. COME ON, GUYS. I GOT TO GO AWAY FOR A WHILE. HERE, KIDS. OVER HERE. DOWN HERE. THAT'S IT, PATCH. COME ON, RUSTY. GO ON. ALL RIGHT. DOWN HERE. THAT'S IT. SEE YOU IN A LITTLE WHILE. ACTUALLY, THIS TRIP WAS PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE CUBS. THROUGH THEM, I DEVELOPED A GROWING INTEREST IN THE FOREST AND EVERYTHING IN IT. SO TODAY I WAS SENDING FOR A MAIL-ORDER COURSE IN NATURAL SCIENCE. - (speaking Native language) - MR. A-TAS-KA-NAY. OLIVER, I'D LIKE TO MAIL THIS. A LITTLE GOLD TOO. MR. A-TAS-KA-NAY. WHAT'S ALL THIS ABOUT? - WE SAW YOU WITH THOSE GOVERNMENT MEN. - WAIT A MINUTE. YOU DON'T THINK THAT-- OLIVER, I DON'T WORK FOR THE PARKS DEPARTMENT. THEY DID WANT ME TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT A NATIONAL PARK. - NO. ALL WE TALK ABOUT IS WHAT IS ON THIS LIST. OKAY? - OKAY. WHEN THE BIG SNOWS COME TO THE NORTH COUNTRY, YOU JUST CAN'T HAVE TOO MUCH FIREWOOD, SO I SPENT MOST OF MY TIME CUTTING LOGS, AND THE CUBS SPENT THEIRS CUTTING UP. MY WINTER LOGGING EQUIPMENT WAS A BUCKSAW, A HOMEMADE SLED, AND A PAIR OF BARREL STAVE SKIS. HIYA, PATCH. HOW YOU DOING? YOU GO ON AND PLAY. I GOT SOME WORK TO DO. BY NOW, THE CUBS HAD JUST ABOUT DOUBLED THEIR SIZE, AND OFTEN AS NOT, THAT MEANT DOUBLE TROUBLE. THIS TIME IT STARTED BECAUSE THERE WAS A SWITCH IN THE ITCH, AND IT WAS PATCH THAT HAD TO SCRATCH. THEN SCRATCH WANTED TO WATCH PATCH SCRATCH. AND THAT'S WHEN THE BEAR WENT OVER THE MOUNTAIN. HEY, PATCH! WHOA! OH! OH, NO! (bears yelping) OH, NO! AS THE DAYS GREW SHORTER AND COLDER, THE CUBS SPENT MORE AND MORE TIME SNOOZING. NOW THEY WERE READY FOR HIBERNATION. AND I'D GIVEN SOME THOUGHT TO THAT. FOR THEIR LONG WINTER'S SLEEP, BEARS NEED A FAIRLY COLD, CONSTANT TEMPERATURE. THAT RULED OUT THE CABIN. BUT I'D COME UP WITH A PLACE THAT SEEMED JUST ABOUT PERFECT-- THE OLD ROOT CELLAR. COME ON, PATCH. WATCH OUT. GET OUT. (grunts) THERE YOU GO. SLEEP TIGHT, FELLAS. I'LL SEE YOU IN THE SPRING. FULL WINTER CAME TO THE WILDERNESS. IT WAS NOT A TIME TO BE OUT AND ABOUT, BUT THAT'S WHEN A SURPRISE VISITOR CAME TO MY CABIN. OLIVER. - I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT NEED SOME SUPPLIES, MAYBE. - I SURE DO. COME ON IN. MAN, THIS IS A SURPRISE. I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE GONNA SPEAK TO ME AGAIN. HOW ABOUT SOME COFFEE? - SURE. OH, UH, THE CHIEF SENT YOU THESE. THEY BELONGED TO HIS SON. - WELL, NOW YOU'VE GOT ME. WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT CHANGED EVERYBODY'S OPINION ABOUT MY BEING A GOVERNMENT MAN? - WELL, WE FIGURED IF YOU WERE REALLY A GOVERNMENT MAN, YOU'D BE BEHIND SOME WARM DESK, NOT HOLED UP HERE, FREEZING TO DEATH. OH, BY THE WAY, THESE BOOKS CAME FOR YOU. - OH, THANKS. I'D BEEN WAITING-- HOW'D YOU KNOW THEY WERE BOOKS? - WELL, I OPENED THE PACKAGE. - YOU DID? - SURE. MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BOMB OR SOMETHING. - (laughs) OLIVER, YOU'RE TOO MUCH. SIT DOWN. - WELL, I'M--I'M REALLY GLAD THAT MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT ME IS ALL CLEARED UP. BUT THERE'S STILL SOMETHING THAT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT, OLIVER. WHY ARE YOU PEOPLE SO DEAD SET AGAINST THIS NATIONAL PARK? - WE'RE NOT DEAD SET AGAINST IT. JUST LET 'EM PUT IT SOMEWHERE ELSE. THAT'S ALL. - YOU--YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE SOME VERY INTERESTING IDEAS. WHY NOT JUST SIT DOWN? - LOOK, EVERY TIME THE RED MAN HAS SAT WITH THE WHITE MAN, HE'S HAD THE CHAIR PULLED OUT FROM UNDER HIM. - NO, THESE GUYS AREN'T LIKE THAT, OLIVER. - JUST TELL ME ONE TIME IN HISTORY WHEN THE INDIAN EVER WON AN ARGUMENT WITH A WHITE MAN. - I--I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL, BUT YOU HAVE NO CHOICE, REALLY. TALK OR NO TALK, THEY'RE GONNA MOVE YOU PEOPLE OUT OF HERE. - WE'LL BE READY FOR 'EM. WELL, I BETTER GET GOING. THERE'S A BLIZZARD COMING UP. I COULD SMELL IT ON MY WAY UP HERE. BY THE WAY, IT'S A GOOD THING YOU GOT RID OF THOSE BEARS. THE CHIEF WILL LIKE THAT. - YEAH, UH, OLIVER? THEY'RE IN THE ROOT CELLAR HIBERNATING. BUT I'M GONNA TURN 'EM LOOSE IN THE SPRING, JUST AS SOON AS THEY'RE BIG ENOUGH. TELL THAT TO THE CHIEF, WILL YA? - NO, I'M NOT GONNA TELL THAT TO THE CHIEF. YOU JUST GET RID OF 'EM. I MEAN IT. FOR THE GOOD OF EVERYBODY. - A WHOLE NEW WORLD OPENED FOR ME THAT WINTER. I WAS REALLY HOOKED BY THOSE MAIL-ORDER BOOKS, ESPECIALLY THE FORESTRY STUFF. ALL ABOUT WHAT EVERYTHING WAS, AND HOW TO TELL ONE FROM THE OTHER. WINTER FINALLY RETREATED TO THE HIGHEST PEAKS, TO MAKE ROOM FOR SPRING AND THE VALLEYS BELOW. THEN, ONE DAY, I GOT A CALL FROM THE ROOT CELLAR. (bears yelping) RUSTY. OH, RUSTY. COME ON OUT. HOW BIG YOU GUYS ARE. WELL, HELLO. COME HERE, SCRATCH. COME HERE, SCRATCH. OH, PATCH. COME HERE, SCRATCH. SCRATCH. COME HERE. COME ON. COME ON. DON'T YOU GUYS RECOGNIZE ME? OKAY. OW. OW. HEY, SCRATCH. HOW YOU DOING? BOY, YOU GUYS HAVE REALLY GOTTEN BIG. THE CUBS WERE BIG ENOUGH NOW TO BE ON THEIR OWN, BUT COULD THEY HOLD THEIR OWN AGAINST OTHER ANIMALS IN THE FOREST? WELL, I'D LOOK FOR THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION. SO I CONTINUED OUR FIELD TRIPS, ONLY NOW, I COMBINED THEM WITH MY NATURE STUDIES. TODAY I WAS LEARNING TO IDENTIFY TRACKS. I'D JUST ABOUT DECIDED I WAS LOOKING AT A COUGAR TRACK. (bears growling) (cougar growling) (hissing) (growling) (growls) PLAINLY, THE CUBS WERE MORE THAN ABLE TO HOLD THEIR OWN. AND THAT SETTLED THAT. FROM THEN ON, THE CUBS CAME AND WENT AS THEY PLEASED. BUT EACH TIME THEY CAME BACK, THE ONE THAT CAME ALL THE WAY WAS ALWAYS PATCH. AND ONE OF THOSE TIMES WAS THE WORST POSSIBLE TIME. (motor whirring) HELLO, MR. A-TAS-KA-NAY. OLIVER. YOU COMING OUT? MR. A-TAS-KA-NAY, THE BEARS ARE FREE NOW IF THEY WANT TO BE. THEY ONLY COME AROUND FOR FOOD. - THEN DON'T GIVE 'EM FOOD. - WELL, IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU, OLIVER. WHAT BRINGS YOU AROUND? - THIS LETTER CAME FOR YOU. - PARKS DEPARTMENT? WELL, IT'S FOR YOU, REALLY. THEY WANTED ME TO TELL YOU THAT A CREW WILL BE COMING AROUND ON THE FOURTH OF THIS MONTH TO START CONSTRUCTION ON THE PARK HEADQUARTERS. - WHERE? - AT THE SETTLEMENT. EVERY EXISTING BUILDING IS TO BE REMOVED. - I TOLD YOU THE BEARS WOULD BRING TROUBLE. - IT'S NOT THE BEARS, MR. A-TAS-KA-NAY. IT'S YOU PEOPLE YOURSELVES. YOU CAN'T IGNORE THIS ANY LONGER. YOU'VE GOT TO DISCUSS IT. - (speaking native language) - OLIVER, BELIEVE ME, I'M ON YOUR SIDE. - SIR, I HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO INFORM YOU THAT AFTER DUE PROCESS OF LAW, THIS AREA HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THE PARKS DEPARTMENT FOR THE PURPOSE OF ESTABLISHING A NATIONAL PARK. THE DEPARTMENT REGRETS YOUR DECISION NOT TO COOPERATE, AND IS LEFT WITH NO FURTHER ALTERNATIVE BUT TO SERVE YOU WITH THIS DOCUMENT. - WHAT IS THIS? - AN OFFICIAL NOTICE TO VACATE. I'M SORRY, SIR. OUR TRUCKS HERE WILL HELP YOU MOVE UP TO THUNDERBIRD LAKE, BUT THERE MUST BE NO DELAYS. WE HAVE TO CLEAR THIS AREA. - YOU GO AHEAD AND TRY, WHITE MAN.

WE'LL BRING THEM ALONG LATER. ALL RIGHT, HAL. GET YOUR MEN BACK TO WORK. - ALL RIGHT, GUYS. LET'S GO. OKAY, COME ON. NO, NO. CUT IT. CUT IT. WAIT. HOLD IT. HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? GO ON. GET OUT OF HERE. - WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? - LOOK AT THAT THING. SOMETHING'S GOTTA BE DONE ABOUT THIS! MILLER, LET'S GO OVER SOME OF THESE CALCULATIONS. (engine starts) - IT WAS A BIG MESS THAT WAS GOING TO GET BIGGER. I WAS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE. (gun fires) - GET DOWN! - HIT THE DECK, MEN! - THAT'S IT, HAL! NO MORE. - ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. (arguing indistinct) - ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO. - HELLO, THIS IS THE PARKS DEPARTMENT. GO AHEAD, WHITE BIRD LAKE. THIS IS JOHN McCARTEN. I WANT TO SPEAK TO THE COMMISSIONER. AND TELL HIM IT'S URGENT. OVER. LOOK, YOU TELL YOUR MEN THAT THEY'LL GET THEIR PROTECTION. I'M CALLING IN RANGERS. - YES, SIR. - NOW GO ON. AND KEEP 'EM QUIET AND CLOSE THAT DOOR. - LISTEN, IF YOU DO THAT, YOU'RE GONNA-- - LOOK, WE HAVE A SITUATION HERE, LESLIE, AND IT'S GOT TO BE DEALT WITH. - FINE, BUT NOT BY FORCE.

WE'VE HAD SEVERAL INCIDENTS, AND TODAY, UH, WE WERE FIRED AT. NOW NOBODY WAS HURT, BUT THE MEN REFUSED TO GO BACK TO WORK UNLESS THEY GET PROTECTION. I THINK YOU SHOULD SEND IN RANGERS. I DEFINITELY FEEL WE NEED A SHOW OF FORCE. DO YOU AGREE, SIR? OVER. - NO FORCE. I'LL SEND IN RANGERS TO PROTECT THE CREW, BUT THE LAST THING WE WANT IS A PITCHED BATTLE. NOW I WANT TO TALK WITH THE INDIANS MYSELF. I'LL FLY UP THERE IN THE MORNING. YOU KEEP THE MEN IN THEIR OWN AREA, AND TRY TO CALM THINGS DOWN TILL I GET THERE. SEE YOU IN THE MORNING, JOHN. OVER AND OUT. - VERY WELL, SIR. WHITE BIRD LAKE, CLEAR. TRY AND KEEP THINGS CALM. NOW JUST HOW AM I GONNA DO THAT? - LET ME TALK TO THE CHIEF. I DON'T THINK I HAVE MUCH INFLUENCE WITH HIM, BUT I CAN TRY. - LOOK, IF YOU HAVE ANY INFLUENCE AT ALL, YOU GO AND FIND THAT OLD MAN AND USE IT, PLEASE. ALL RIGHT NOW, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, KEEP IT QUIET. - HIS BOSS DIDN'T DO IT RIGHT NOW, BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG HE'S GONNA BE ABLE TO HOLD HIM OFF. HE SAID HE WAS GONNA COME OUT HERE AND LOOK AT THE SITUATION HIMSELF, SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE. IF HE SEES HOW DESPERATE IT IS, WITH INDIANS SHOOTING AT... - OUR LAND. OUR GREAT LAND. WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO? SIT HERE? LET 'EM SPIT ON US WHILE THEY STEAL OUR LAND? - SOMEONE'S GONNA GET HURT. NOW I DON'T WANT THAT, AND YOU DON'T WANT IT EITHER. WE CAN SETTLE THIS WHOLE THING IF YOU JUST LISTEN TO WHAT THE COMMISSIONER HAS TO SAY. - THAT OLD MAN, OUR GREAT CHIEF! HE AIN'T GONNA DO NOTHING ABOUT IT! I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'M GONNA DO. NEXT WHITE MAN I SEE, I'M GONNA LIFT HIS SCALP. - CHIEF. - HEY, YOU. YOU GOT A NICE SCALP. HOW ABOUT I PUT A PART IN THAT, UH, CURLY HAIR, HUH? (grunting) - SAM! THAT'S ENOUGH! THAT'S ENOUGH, SAM. WHY DON'T YOU GO SOBER UP? - HEY! (speaking native language) - I GUESS I BRING OUT THE WORST IN HIM. AS A PEACEMAKER, I'D BEEN A WASHOUT, SO I DECIDED TO MIND MY OWN BUSINESS, AND, MEANTIME, CHECK ON MY BEARS. PATCH? I'M HOME, FELLA. WHILE PATCH STILL STAYED GENERALLY CLOSE TO THE CABIN, RUSTY AND SCRATCH BY NOW WERE OFTEN GONE FOR SEVERAL DAYS AT A TIME. TODAY, FOR A CHANGE, THEY WERE ALL CLOSE BY AND TOURING AROUND TOGETHER. HIYA, FELLAS. HOW YOU DOING? (suspenseful music) ♪ ♪ (grunts) (splash) (Patch whines) PATCH WAS ALIVE, BUT HE NEEDED HELP, AND I NEEDED SOME WAY OF MOVING HIM. A BLANKET FROM THE CABIN WOULD DO. ALL I COULD DO NOW WAS DRAG PATCH TO THE SAFETY OF THE LAKE SHORE. - (speaking native language) - ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO. LET'S GET IT IN GEAR, MEN. COME ON, LET'S GO. AROUND THE LAKE THERE'S ANOTHER ROAD. FOLLOW US. OKAY, LET'S GO. GET THOSE SHOVELS. COME ON. GET THOSE AXES. MAKE THOSE TRUCKS STOP. MOVE 'EM BACK. - HEY, CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME HELP? OVER HERE! HEY, OLIVER. I KNOW I SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THAT FIRE, BUT I WOULDN'T ABANDON PATCH. GIVE ME A HAND OVER HERE. I NEED SOME HELP. THAT'S WHEN I DISCOVERED HOW MUCH OF A FRIEND I HAD IN OLIVER RED FERN. HE UNDERSTOOD HOW I FELT, AND STAYED TO LEND A HAND. WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK, OLIVER? WHAT ARE HIS CHANCES? - I DON'T KNOW, BOB. I DON'T KNOW HOW BAD HE'S HURT. - ISN'T THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO FOR HIM? - I HAVE SOME MEDICINE. LET'S GET HIM BACK TO CAMP. - WHATEVER THEIR PERSONAL DIFFERENCES, THE CONSTRUCTION CREW AND THE INDIANS WERE TOGETHER AGAINST THE COMMON ENEMY--FIRE. THE REST OF THE DAY, THEY FOUGHT SIDE BY SIDE, AND BY LATE EVENING, IT WAS ALL OVER. MEANWHILE, ANOTHER BATTLE WASN'T GOING AS WELL... FOR PATCH. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS, OLIVER. I CAN FEEL THE SLUG IN HIS SHOULDER, AND IT'S NOT ALL THAT BAD A WOUND, BUT HE WON'T COME AROUND. - SOMETIMES THAT HAPPENS, BOB. HUNTERS CALL IT SHOCK. HE MIGHT DIE. - MR. A-TAS-KA-NAY, WILL YOU HELP US? PLEASE? - IF A BEAR DIES, IT'S THE WILL OF THE GREAT SPIRIT. - GREAT SPIRIT DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS. IT WAS SAM EAGLE SPEAKER AND HIS RIFLE. - SAM EAGLE SPEAKER WILL NOT COME TO THIS PLACE AGAIN. - YOU PEOPLE, ANYONE, DO YOU KNOW OF A WAY? DO YOU HAVE A MEDICINE TO HELP THE BEAR? YOU'RE GONNA LET THIS BEAR DIE FOR NO REASON. LARCH TOLD ME HIS FATHER HAD MUCH WISDOM, BUT RIGHT NOW, I DON'T BUY THAT. - YOU HAVE NO RESPECT. - YES, I KNOW. YOU TOLD ME THAT. BUT THERE'S ONE THING I DO RESPECT--LIFE. IT'S ALL THAT MATTERS. YOUR SON AND I LEARNED THAT ON THE BATTLEFIELD, AND LET ME TELL YOU THIS, IF LARCH WERE HERE RIGHT NOW IN YOUR PLACE, HE'D HELP HIS BROTHER THE BEAR. THANK YOU, OLIVER. - (speaking native language) - WHAT'S GOING-- WHAT DID HE SAY? HE SAID TAKE THE BEAR TO HIS TIPI. - IF I DO THIS, IF THE BEAR LIVES, WILL YOU PROMISE TO SET HIM FREE? - YES, I PROMISE. - AND IF THE BEAR COMES TO YOU AGAIN, WILL YOU DRIVE HIM AWAY? - I'LL DRIVE HIM AWAY. - THAT IS GOOD. (speaking native language) HE WANTS TO DIE. - NO. PATCH? PATCH? COME ON, BOY. COME ON. COME ON. PATCH. HERE. HERE. GOOD. HERE. HERE. COME ON. GOOD. ATTA BOY. GOOD. THAT'S GOOD. - WE WILL LEAVE HIM NOW. HE WILL SLEEP. - I THINK I BETTER STAY WITH HIM. HE NEEDS ME. OKAY. IT'S ALL RIGHT NOW. (mewling) PATCH. HI, FELLA. HOW YOU DOING? YOU FEELING ALL RIGHT? YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD. LOOK AT YOU SITTING UP. - YOU COME. - MR. A-TAS-KA-NAY, HE'S FEELING BETTER. HE'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT. - COME. (seaplane landing outside) - THE CRISIS HAD PASSED FOR THE BEAR, BUT FOR THE INDIANS, IT WAS STILL COMING UP. - LOOK. IS THIS THE MAN YOU TALKED ABOUT? THE CHIEF? - IT MUST BE THE COMMISSIONER. - (speaking native language) - PATCH? I GOT TO GO AWAY FOR A WHILE, BUT I'LL COME BACK AND GET YOU, OKAY? - FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO THANK YOU PEOPLE FOR GATHERING HERE AND LISTENING TO WHAT I HAVE TO SAY. NOW I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY FANCY SPEECH. I JUST WANT TO REASON WITH YOU AND TRY TO COME TO SOME PEACEFUL UNDERSTANDING. WE GOT A BAD SITUATION HERE. WE KNOW IT. WE KNOW YOU'RE ANGRY, AND WE UNDERSTAND WHY. BUT THE POINT IS THAT THIS LAKE, AND ALL THE AREA AROUND HERE, IS GOVERNMENT PROPERTY. EVERYBODY IN THIS COUNTRY, INCLUDING YOU, HAVE A RIGHT TO USE IT AND ENJOY IT. THAT'S WHY THE DECISION WAS MADE TO DEVELOP THIS INTO A NATIONAL PARK. NOW IT WAS NEVER OUR PLAN TO THROW YOU PEOPLE OUT WITH NO PLACE TO GO. SO A RESERVE HAS BEEN SET ASIDE AT THUNDERBIRD LAKE. AND YOU'LL HAVE EVERYTHING THERE THAT YOU HAVE HERE. AND LOTS MORE. - ENOUGH. YOU HAVE TALKED ENOUGH. WE DON'T WANT THESE THINGS. WE WANT ONLY TO KEEP WHAT IS OURS. THIS LAND WAS OURS LONG BEFORE THE WHITE MAN CAME. WE WERE BORN HERE, AND WE WILL DIE HERE. AND IF THE TIME HAS COME, WE WILL DIE RIGHT NOW. - NOW JUST A MINUTE. LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT ANYBODY DYING. - WE HAVE LISTENED TO YOU. NOW I WILL TALK TO MY PEOPLE. (speaking native language) - WHERE ARE THEY GOING? WHAT DID HE TELL THEM? - OLIVER, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? - THEY ARE GOING TO JOIN THEIR ANCESTORS. - WHERE? - IN THE SACRED PLACE ON THE MOUNTAIN. - WHAT FOR? - THEY WILL WAIT AND FAST UNTIL THEY ALL DIE. - YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS. - COMMISSIONER, BELIEVE ME, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO. - COMMISSIONER, ISN'T THERE ONE SIMPLE ANSWER TO ALL OF THIS? WHY DO THESE PEOPLE HAVE TO GO? WHY CAN'T THEY JUST STAY HERE? - 'CAUSE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. JOHN, WE GOT TO GET BACK TO THE OFFICE-- - WHY IS IT IMPOSSIBLE? AFTER ALL, THESE PEOPLE ARE AS MUCH A PART OF THE ECOLOGY AS THE FOREST AND THE WILDLIFE. - LOOK, IT'S AGAINST REGULATIONS, BOB. NOBODY'S PERMITTED TO LIVE IN A NATIONAL PARK BUT THE RANGERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. - THEN WHY NOT MAKE 'EM RANGERS? - IT WOULD TAKE YEARS FOR THEM TO QUALIFY. I MEAN, MOST RANGERS ARE COLLEGE MEN WITH DEGREES IN BOTANY, BIOLOGY-- - JOHN, WE DON'T HAVE THE TIME. MR. LESLIE, WOULD YOU LET US SOLVE OUR OWN PROBLEMS OUR OWN WAY? NOW, WE DON'T WANT AN INCIDENT HERE. JUST KEEP THOSE PEOPLE ALL SEPARATED. GET IN TOUCH WITH WAYNE THOMAS OVER AT THE DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS. MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THE COMMISSIONER'S ADVICE AND MINDED MY OWN BUSINESS, BUT I FELT I HAD TO FIND THE CHIEF AND ONCE MORE TRY TO TALK TO HIM. I OWED IT TO LARCH. I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE THE SACRED PLACE WAS, SO I JUST KEPT HIKING AND SEARCHING THE MOUNTAIN. MR. A-TAS-KA-NAY? - THIS PLACE IS SACRED TO US. WHY DO YOU COME HERE? - BECAUSE YOU'RE... BECAUSE LARCH WOULD HAVE COME TO TALK... TO REASON WITH HIS FATHER. - MY SON IS DEAD. YOU CANNOT SPEAK FOR HIM. - WELL, I CAN TRY. MR. A-TAS-KA-NAY, YOUR SON HAD WISDOM TOO. HE--HE LEARNED THAT THE WORLD CHANGES, THAT THE INDIAN CAN NO LONGER LIVE BY THE OLD WAY. - I WILL NOT CHANGE. MY PEOPLE WILL NOT CHANGE. - BUT IS--IS A PIECE OF LAND, A--A LAKE, ARE THEY WORTH DYING FOR? - THE WHITE MAN IS LIKE A COYOTE. HE GOES FROM PLACE TO PLACE, CLAIMS EACH HUNTING GROUND AS HIS OWN. BUT THE GREAT BEAR HAS ONLY ONE HUNTING GROUND. WE ARE THE PEOPLE OF THE BEAR. THIS IS OUR HUNTING GROUND... AND OUR HOME. DO YOU NOT KNOW THE MEANING OF HOME? LEAVE US IN PEACE. - JUST WANT TO BE SURE YOU'RE AVAILABLE. OVER. - I WILL BE, McCARTEN. JUST KEEP ME INFORMED, ALL RIGHT? - YES, SIR, I WILL. OVER. - I FOUND THE CHIEF, TALKED TO HIM. - WELL? - HE WOULDN'T BUDGE. NOT AN INCH. JOHN, YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SOME KIND OF CONCESSION. - I CAN'T MAKE CONCESSIONS. YOU KNOW THAT. - NOW LOOK, HOW LONG DO YOU THINK THOSE OLD MEN CAN LAST OUT THERE ON THAT MOUNTAIN? NOW EITHER YOU DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT, OR I WILL, AND I'LL START BY CALLING THE NEWSPAPERS. - THAT WOULD BE A MISTAKE. - I'M NOT GONNA S-- - THIS IS OPERATIONS OUTPOST STATION. - YES, THIS IS WHITE BIRD LAKE, LO-99. I WANT TO MAKE A LONG-DISTANCE CALL, PLEASE. OVER. - HOLD ON. I'LL COMPLETE YOUR CONNECTION. - OKAY, I'LL HOLD ON. LOOK, BOB, YOU HAD ANOTHER IDEA, AND IT WASN'T A BAD ONE. JUST PLAY IT COOL FOR A WHILE AND LET ME WORK ON IT, OKAY? - YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME, MR. McCARTEN? - HAL, STANDBY. - WHAT IDEA? - LOOK, LATER, BOB. HAL. LOOK, THE COMMISSIONER WANTED ME TO GO OVER SOME THINGS WITH YOU. NUMBER ONE, UH, KEEP THE MEN DOWN THE CANYON. AND KEEP THEM AWAY FROM THE LAKE. - McCARTEN HAD SAID I'D HAD AN IDEA THAT WASN'T BAD. IF SO, IT WAS THE ONLY THING THAT WASN'T BAD. MY BOOKS, NOTEBOOKS, EVERYTHING, GONE WITH THE CABIN. AND AN IMPORTANT PART OF MY LIFE AS WELL. BUT AT LEAST I COULD STILL KEEP MY PROMISE TO THE CHIEF. COME ON, BOY. LET'S GO FIND SCRATCH AND RUSTY. I KNEW I'D FEEL A LOT BETTER ABOUT PATCH IF HE COULD BE WITH SCRATCH AND RUSTY. RUSTY! SCRATCH! THE FIRE HAD DRIVEN THE OTHER TWO CUBS AWAY. I'D FIGURED ON THAT. BUT I HADN'T FIGURED HOW FAR AWAY. DURING THE NEXT FOUR DAYS, WE COVERED A LOT OF MILES, AND NEVER UNCOVERED ONE SIGN OF SCRATCH AND RUSTY. AND NOW I WAS BEGINNING TO THINK PATCH MIGHT HAVE TO GO IT ALONE. THEN WHEN I'D ABOUT DECIDED WE'D NEVER FIND THE TWO CUBS, THE TWO CUBS FOUND US. RUSTY. SCRATCH. (snorts) GO ON. GO ON WITH SCRATCH AND RUSTY. (yelps) WELL, GO ON. GET OUT OF HERE. IT WAS A LONG, LONELY NIGHT. I DID A LOT OF THINKING. ABOUT THE CUBS, ABOUT OLD PETER AND OLIVER AND THE INDIANS. AND ABOUT MYSELF. (motor whirring) CHIEF, OLIVER. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? WHAT HAPPENED? - I WILL SPEAK. A VISION CAME ON THE MOUNTAIN. AND AS I FASTED AND PRAYED, THEIR WAS A SIGN-- A RAINBOW ON WHITE BIRD LAKE. - A RAINBOW? - IT CAME TO ME THAT OUR LAND WOULD BE GIVEN BACK TO US, AND THAT WE WOULD LIVE HERE AS ALWAYS. THAT DAY, IT CAME. - WHAT CAME? - A TOKEN FROM THE WHITE CHIEF. A TOKEN THAT FROM THIS DAY FORWARD WE WOULD LIVE IN PEACE TOGETHER. - CHIEF, COULD I ASK YOU WHAT KIND OF TOKEN? &quot;CHIEF DEPUTY RANGER.&quot; - WE'RE ALL DEPUTY RANGERS. EVERY MAN IN THE TRIBE. - DEPUTY RANGER. HA. HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT GUY? HE DID IT. - WHAT GUY? DID WHAT? - McCARTEN. HE TOOK MY IDEA, ADDED A WORD, AND MADE IT WORK. - I DON'T GET IT. - WELL, HE COULDN'T MAKE YOU RANGERS, SO HE--NEVER MIND. THE POINT IS THAT YOU CAN STAY. YOU CAN GO ON LIVING HERE, RIGHT? - WE ARE TO BE IN CHARGE OF ANIMAL CONTROL. - ANIMAL CONTROL? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? - WE CONTROL THE ANIMALS BY FISHING AND HUNT. BUT ONLY FOR OUR FOOD. - WELL THEN, NOTHING'S CHANGED, REALLY. - OH, YES, SOMETHING HAS CHANGED. THEY PAY US NOW. AND THEY BUILD US HOUSES. SOMETIMES THE WAYS OF THE WHITE MAN IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND, BUT IT'S ALL THE WILL OF THE GREAT SPIRIT. WHEN YOU HAD THE BEARS, WE HAD ONLY TROUBLE. NOW YOU'VE SET THEM FREE, GOOD THINGS HAPPEN. (distant bear calls) - CHIEF. - YOU'VE DONE WELL, MY SON. - CHIEF. - PATCH! - HEY, YOU DID NOT KEEP YOUR PROMISE. - CHIEF, BELIEVE ME, I DID. NO, PATCH. GO BACK. GO ON, PATCH. GO AWAY. - NOW WE'LL HAVE MORE TROUBLE. - LET'S GET INTO THE BOAT. - GO BACK. GO BACK, PATCH. STAY AWAY, PATCH. GO, BOY. GO BACK. GO BACK, PATCH. GO ON, BOY. GO BACK. GO BACK, PATCH. GO BACK. - HERE. USE THIS. - I CAN'T DO THAT. - YOU HAVE TO DRIVE HIM AWAY YOURSELF. - PATCH, GO BACK. GO BACK. (whines and groans) THAT WAS THE HARDEST THING I'D EVER HAD TO DO, BUT ONCE IT WAS DONE, I KNEW IT WAS RIGHT. THE BEARS BELONG TO THE WILDERNESS NOW, AND THEY'D BE SAFE IN THE NEW NATIONAL PARK. AND MAYBE I'D SEE THEM AGAIN TOO, BECAUSE NOW I KNEW WHAT I WANTED TO DO WITH MY LIFE. I'D FINISH MY STUDIES IN COLLEGE AND APPLY FOR THE FORESTRY SERVICE. IF I WAS LUCKY, I MIGHT EVEN BE ASSIGNED TO THE WHITE BIRD WILDERNESS. LARCH WOULD HAVE LIKED THAT.
