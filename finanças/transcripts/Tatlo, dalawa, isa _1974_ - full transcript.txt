Where am I? You're in the rehab center. Scrub that floor, you worthless pieces of shit! Why are you here? - To get well. - How? - With your help. - Why? Are we doctors? No. You are my brothers. So what? - You will help me get better. - Idiot! What do you think we are? Do you think we're like you? Stupid idiot! You only think of yourself! Go back to the hell you came from! In this place we don't care about garbage like you! Hey! We're all the same. You think this place is a hospital? You're lost. The hospital's in Manila. You think you're going to be cured here? You're an idiot. Drug addict! We don't take in garbage. Go back where you came from. If you think we're going to help you, forget it. You'll get nothing from us! Moron! Why are you here? I want to help myself. Idiot! Asshole! I don't like Noni. When he got here yesterday, he looked at me the wrong way. Like he was some bigshot looking down on me. Is Gerry telling the truth? I didn't look down on him. Asshole! When you arrived, you looked like you were disgusted by us! I was afraid. I didn't know anyone. I didn't know what to do. You got no balls? You need someone to hold your hand and tell you what to do? Is that it, boy? Poor kid. Do you want milk? He looks like he's still suckling at his mommy's tit. Maybe there's a mommy here who needs a baby. When he's mommy's not around, he's a coward. We're not going to fight with you. Hey! Announce it on the radio. We got a lost child. This isn't an ordinary place, you know that. Then why do you look down on us? I'm not looking down on you. Who else has a problem with Noni? You think you're better than we are. I don't like him. It's like he's proud of something. I am proud. I'm not like you. Who do you think you are, screaming at me? Do you know anything about me? We have one thing in common. That's all you know. Do you know yourself? Would I be angry if I didn't know myself? Animals get angry too. I'm not an animal! Show us who you are. I'm an honor student from the Ateneo de Manila. I was there from grade school. Then they put me in Pigpen University and I'm still an honor student. How can I show you who I am when you only want to see the ugliness? I'm an honor student from the Ateneo de Manila. I was there from grade school. Then they put me in Pigpen University and I'm still an honor student. How can I show you who I am when you only want to see the ugliness? If you want to show us who you are, use your Ateneo accent. Ateneo student! Speak in English! Spokening dollars! Junkie thinks he's hot shit. Bourgeois shit. You think you're something? - Animal! - Animal! What else do you see? I see an animal trembling with rage. He can't speak. Can't think straight. I understand him, but I don't like him. I see an animal who sees the ugliness in others... but not within himself. I see an animal I don't know and will never know... because he doesn't want to act like a human. Animals! You're angry with yourself. - Animals! - Animals! Stop it. Please. Stop it! Stop it! Why are you crying, Noni? I'm hurt. What? I'm hurting. How are you hurting? I don't know. I feel it. What do you feel? The pain. How painful? Painful. What? Painful. Say it! We can't hear him. - He's like a record. - What pain? Rheumatism? Hey junkie, we don't have dead men here. What are you waiting for? - Say it! - It hurts! Again! It hurts! - Shout it! - It hurts! It hurts. It hurts. It's so hurting. You are in Hope House. This is not just a rehab center. It's a therapeutic community. Whatever you experience here is for your own good. Trust us. Don't lose hope. Whatever you hear is meant to help you. We're all brothers here. It doesn't matter who you were before. What matters is the here and now. Do you understand? Yes, brother. The hurtful words we use in encounter sessions here, are meant to open you up and make you face yourself. When you are open to yourself, you are open to your fellowmen. They are the mirrors that show you the truth about yourself. You are their mirror. You will see that real peace, comes with real humility. You will pick yourself up and make yourself whole. Don't be afraid. If you are alone in your pain, you are not alone here. So many words but only one truth. We're prisoners and we'll never taste freedom. Look at our surroundings... the mountains, lakes, forest and trees. Far from civilization and Manila. Sometimes a plane flies overhead. The pilot says, there's Hope House where the pitiful are. Asshole! Piece of shit! You're the asshole! Shut up! You sound like idiots! You can't fix one fault with another. You have to talk it over. Understand? Yes. Are you alright? Who's next? Asshole! You think your jokes are funny? Don't you know you're offending others? You're the asshole! You started it! Idiot! You're both idiots. Did you come here to be comedians? You came here so you could understand your lives. Who else? - I have a question for Noni. - Go on. Why are you always quiet? You don't mingle with us. I do everything that's assigned to me. Noni, you can't just follow orders. You can't close yourself off. You have to open up to the whole family. You have to relate to others. Anything else? I have a problem with Totoy. Go on. You fucking annoy me! You're always looking at me! Morning, noon, night staring at me! Is he right? Yes. I admit I look at him. But I didn't know it annoys him. Why do you stare at me? Nothing. I envy you. Why do you envy me? You have the qualities I want. Idiot! Envy won't give you what you want. That's why you can't progress, you're all envy! What do you envy? Your face. Your body. What are you, a faggot? You don't like being dark and fat? I have something to tell you. I've been hiding it for a long time. Before I came here I was... You were what? - What Rudy said. - What? A homosexual. You're laughing? Why don't you want to say it? I'm ashamed. Why are you ashamed? Cause people treat you differently. You don't want to be called gay? What? Don't just shake your head, say it! Why don't you say it? You're gay. Faggot! Yes. Why did you never say it? You've been here a long time, but you only admit it now. Because I want to show myself to you. You want Rocky to know you're gay. I know lots of gays! I'm sick of them! Not all gays are the same. - Faggot! - Faggot! A fag was staring at me. Your hair's long. Brother Carlos explained the method here. It seems alright. At first I didn't understand all the yelling and cursing... but now I understand. You need it to be stronger. To be stronger for what? So I can look at you? I have to be stronger to look at you, to accept you. I did nothing wrong. I am a human being. I'm human, too. Weak like you. You didn't have to lock me up here. Whatever I did was because I'm human and weak. You don't understand. It's clear to me. You went with Mike because you're only human. But if all people used that excuse, then nothing would be considered wrong. I'm a junkie because I couldn't accept the truth about you. We junkies get locked up here to be strong. Where will you be locked up? Let him be. Let him feel the pain, he needs it. He'll understand eventually. Idiots! If you want to eat, work first! Plant what you're going to eat! You're too slow! What are you doing with that garbage? Don't you have a brain? Are you still there? Where's Gerry? Where's Gerry? Goddammit! Double time! Where's Gerry! Weren't you looking after him? He ran! Quick! Get in! Get him! Here's Gerry. A runaway... a child... a weakling... a coward. Many resent you for what you did. Many are envious. Many feel bad for trusting you, for the time we spent on you. When will you stop running? When your mother is dead? When you can't feel? Who will take care of you? Now you have to start all over. Try to change. Remember that only the dead can't change. Noni. Objective. I can't run away from myself. That's why I'm here. I'm afraid to face the truth. I disguised myself. I ran. I closed myself to others. I cannot understand my true self. I will shed my disguise and face myself with my brothers. Here we stand together. I will be a person of dignity with the help of God and my brothers. Why did you run? I always run. Didn't you know? That's why I keep changing rehab centers. Those are the happiest moments of my life. The whiff of freedom. Even for a while. Aren't you afraid? Why be afraid? I always come back. What if they put you in the ICU? No. I spoke to Brother Carlos. I'll stay here. What did you tell him? Nothing. I gave him the drama. That's what everyone here wants. The drama. What did you see outside? Joy. I felt like a bird. Like I had no problems. I stopped at the bridge. It was beautiful. The sky. The earth. The water. When I was there, I thought of my parents... My former friends. I don't know why. Then I thought about this place. I started laughing. Just one year ago, I was singing in clubs with a band. Then what did the boat say? The boat can't speak... but when Juan Tamad rode, the boat it began to move. Do you know why? Because of the water. What's with the water? The water moved. Right. So the boat brought Juan Tamad to the middle of the lake. Mom, where's my father? He's in the U.S. Why doesn't he come here? Because he's working. Who are you going with? Gerry. Remember him? The one with the moustache? Yes. He's nice. He gave you that electric train for your birthday. Why do you always go with him? Because your mommy has no friends. Your daddy's not here. He's not coming back. You understand, right? Gerry? Hurry up! All you know is sleeping and eating! What's wrong Noni? I want to leave. Just bear with it a while longer. There will be other Octobers. Novembers. Let's love each other all year, even when it's not Christmas. Let's love each other all year, even when it's not Christmas. Now I will sing for you. But first, a gift for you. I'm giving you leave to visit your families for two days. - Hip-hip! - Hurray! - Hip-hip! - Hurray! - Hip-hip! - Hurray! - Hip-hip! - Hurray! - Hip-hip! - Hurray! Hey look, a necktie! My grandma's picking me up. When I come back I'll bring gifts for everyone! Isn't someone picking you up? They already visited on Christmas day. You? My folks are in the province. Too far. Hasn't Roger left yet? He's still there. What time are you going? I'm not. I thought someone was fetching you. I only said that cause people were listening. No one fetches me on holidays. You? Is your mother coming? She wanted to, but I said no. Why not? Nothing. Why are you still here? The car was supposed to pick me up. It's still not here. Maybe they had engine trouble. They said they would come. I thought you'd already left. I said 6 o'clock but they're not here yet. You're still here? We're supposed to hitch a ride with Popoy. It's a good thing someone was left in charge. My ex-girlfriend was from Maryknoll. She ditched me when I got in here. Me too. She dumped you? You had a girlfriend? Mine has a job. When she heard I was here, she left for the States. Got a sweetheart? I left my sweetheart. Didn't like his moustache. Careful! Don't fall down! See that light? That's where we live. See that red billboard? Near there. - We live near you. - Where do you live? Nowhere. What can you see, it's all dark? We go by the lights. It's almost midnight. Let's shout out messages for Manila. Starting with the youngest. Blabbermouth! Manila! I'm almost home! To the Maryknoll girls who cheated on me, I'll cheat on you too! Granny! Why didn't you pick me up! You old crone! I'll be home soon! We're going to do it! Mom! I'm all out of clean underwear! Manila! I like to sleep next to you! Happy New Year! Happy New Year! When school starts... we'll give you live-out privileges for a year. You'll help at the center in Fort Bonifacio. After that we'll consider you a graduate. Thank you, brother. How are you? Do you still feel the need? No, Sir. But I have bad dreams. I get scared. What dreams? I'm running down a long hallway. Someone's chasing me, I don't know who. I stop in front of a door. I open it, then I wake up. What's behind the door? I don't know. I always wake up. I know what's in it. What? I know what's behind that door, it's your self. Yes, Noni. You're afraid to face yourself. Your weakness. Behind that door is the truth. Noni, what's that? Leave me alone! Let go of me! After giving some interview questions to your son... We've decided to commit your son to the intensive care drug rehab unit. That's where we send those who don't cooperate. Isn't it dangerous there? Don't worry. After a few days we can transfer him to a rehab center. He can still get better. I just came from the drug rehab office. Why did you have me locked up? It's for your own good. My own good? Or your own good? You must be happy. You can do whatever you want. This is your locker. Put your things here. Are you afraid? If you need anything, tell me. What's your name? I'm one of the female expediters here. Expediter. I know how you feel, Noni. I was a drug addict too. If you don't try, you'll never be well. Remember that. Help us! Have pity on me. Help me! Don't you understand? I can't forget the past. That part of my life. The horror. The ugliness. Don't find excuses, Noni. Don't compare yourself to those who are lucky. What matters is yourself. What you can do. What you must do. Wake up. Then you can leave this place. Open that door... and you will truly be free. Mom? I'm sorry. Good luck. I wish you all the best. All the best. Thanks. "I only laugh at my own life." Gerry? Gerry? Gerry? Gerry? Gerry? Gerry? Gerry? I'll clean the house after I'm done ironing. I'll put up those curtains we use on Christmas so it's more presentable. Whatever you do, it'll still look the same. It may not be a rich home, but it'll be clean. What food will you serve them? I'm bringing these to Miss Gomez, then I'll borrow plates and utensils. I've already bought the fruit cocktail. Look. I also bought two bottles of gin. That's not enough. Leave everything to me. Don't worry. What did your father say in the letter? What time are they coming tomorrow? 4pm. Their plane arrives tonight, so they'll visit us tomorrow. Visit you, not us. They only want to see you. By the way, a letter arrived for you yesterday. Must be from America. The stamp is American. Why is it open? Read it. What does it say? You don't know what it says? How would I know? Why did you open it, it's not yours. It's not as if you could read. Why are you getting up? I'm going. You're not done with breakfast. I lost my appetite. Gina! Is your father really coming? Gina, we heard something about you. What? That your American father is arriving from the States. Yes. Why? He might know about my ex. They were in the navy together. Maybe my daughter can finally meet her father. I hear he's bringing his wife. So what? Nothing. What about your mother? It's none of your business. Watch it! Stop that! We're just playing basketball. Playing?! You're being rude. We're just kidding. I don't find it funny. What a snob. We're the same color. You again? My class is at eight. Why do you always follow me? Is it wrong? It annoys me. Don't you like the company? If it's you, forget it. Why do you speak to me like that? I'm just like you. No, Rudy. I'm different. They're shooting a movie with Susan Roces! Let's go! No thanks. Come on! Don't be a killjoy. I'd go if it were Troy. Always Troy. When are you going to meet him? Soon. "She peeked in the hallway. There was no one there so she came out... to be continued." I don't understand why Patricia likes Diego. Why wouldn't she? Her husband beats her. Mrs. Dadang, your child is crying. You brat! All you do is play! We'll be on our way. All you do is look at comic books. It's my only entertainment. Were they here all day? What did you talk about? The way you talk! We didn't discuss anything. Nothing? Everyone in the neighborhood knows my father is coming. Do you have to tell them everything? It's nothing. They're our friends. They're like family. Maybe to you. Get dressed. I'll set the table. You've prepared so much food. I have to finish this now. Dadang and I are leaving early tomorrow. Where are you going? Antipolo. We might be there till late. But we're expecting guests. You know I have no education. Can't speak English. He's bringing his wife. What would I say? I'll take care of it. I'll do the talking. Let me go. It's you they want to see. But I need you here. You're the one who knows him. I thought you'd help me. So he'll take me away from here immediately. Take you away? He's my hope. You have to help me get out of here. I don't want to get old and wrinkled waiting for my chance. Day in, day out it's always the same here. But if I go to America I can prosper. I can go places. I don't like it here. You're a big girl now. Whatever you decide, I'll support you. "News from UPI. Lyndon Johnson has been sworn in as the President of the United States..." What's that on the radio? The President of the United States. Kennedy. He was killed. "This is your Auntie Dely." Why aren't you dressed? Why do I have to get dressed? This is clean. Look at yourself, it's embarrassing. I was listening to that program! Enough of drama. This is better. Why'd you prepare so much? We only have two guests. Better too much than not enough. We should get a half-gallon of ice cream. Americans would like that because it's so hot here. Americans don't like fiestas with so much food. This flan you made? They don't eat that. They'll get a tummyache and blame us. Not the flan. Your father likes that. Before he went back to the States, he ate two servings. Is the living room clean? I've been thinking about what you said. I think they will take you to the States. You'd have a better future there. Don't worry about me. I can take care of myself. Look, when you were two. Your hair was brown and so curly. You drank two cans of milk a day. You had smooth skin and shiny hair. This is when you were Reina Elena at the May festival. I bought you a lace dress, 12 pesos in Quiapo. And white shoes. You were like an angel. When you're in America, write to me. Send me pictures. All your dreams will come true. You'll finish your studies. Maybe you'll find a husband. Exactly. And I'll never come back here. I don't want them to know I came from a pigpen. Have a boy wait for them at the corner, they might get lost. Good idea. Here's 10 cents. When you see two Americans, bring them to my house. Go. Watch where you're going! Why did you hit my son! He should be careful. He didn't mean it. Didn't mean it? If you don't like it, go to America. Here children are running everywhere. What's going on? She hit my kid! Why did you do that? He bumped into me! Gina, this is a squatter community. A little understanding. Understanding! Your children are a nuisance. Don't talk like that. You can't go through life by yourself. You'll never prosper because you meddle in other people's lives. Do you think you'd survive without us? When your mother gave birth, who helped her? When your sick, who helps her? We're not like your father who impregnated her, then left. Go with your American father! No one will bother you there! Mother? What are you doing, drinking? We're expecting guests! I'm not drunk. We're just having a drink. She's just confiding her problem... You know we're expecting guests and you let her drink. The hell I know. I was putting the kid to sleep and she comes up here. I'll tell your wife! Go on, you think I'm afraid of her? If she scolds me, I'll leave her! Over there. Gina's father is here! Who says I'm drunk? What will I do when they get here? Let them in, talk to them, serve them food. Mother, the American is here! He's here! Hurry! They're here! William, your friend. My boyfriend, you remember? My G.I. baby. Looks like William. I'll talk to you later. If we have guests, we face them. - I'll tell them you're out. Stay here. - Why are you ashamed of me? You're drunk. Please stay here. Do it for me. Don't be noisy. Don't come out. G.I. Joe! Victory Joe! Yes. So you're Gina. Aren't you going to let us in? Please come in. Be seated. Let me talk to him, maybe he knows about William. Please leave us alone. Our house will fall down! Don't you have anything else to do? I'm sorry about that. I'm glad you got my letter from the embassy. Hello, Soldier. Mom. Have a seat. He wants to bring me to the States to study. You don't have to work anymore. He'll send you money every month. He can take you, but I'm not taking his money. I wasn't paid to have Gina. Go on, tell him. Tell him! You haven't changed much, Tom. Your stomach is so big! Your face is wrinkled. Under the eyes. You're not the gallant soldier I knew. It's funny. Even the Gods fade, too. Soldier! Hello! Why are you backing away? Don't you remember me? I gave you everything, I raised your child. Look at her, isn't it a pretty doll? You're the same. Let's drink and be merry. Mom, you're drunk. Let me be. Your wife, is she pretty? I'll call her so she can drink with me. Are you ashamed of me? We have another guest. Introduce me. Isn't she my guest, too? You're pretty. Who are you? Are you American? Mother, that's enough. That's his wife. His wife? Is it her? There's nothing you can do. You let him fool you. Me? Did you fool me, Tom? You're right. I'm not your wife. You just disappeared, in the dead of night. You didn't say goodbye. You left me with only my memories. I thought you were heroes. I was happy. I ran to welcome you in your tanks and trucks. You were like gods. I trusted you. I trusted you. I let my savior fool me. My hero deceived me. Why? What is he saying? Are they taking you with them? Let's entertain them. Sorry. I said I'm sorry. They only wanted to see you. I took care of you for 17 years. They didn't see you once. Now he comes here, with his wife, to take you from me. Everything I have, they take from me. When will it end. Animals. Why are you doing that? Señorita Rosenda left orders. Why? Where did she go? She went out. What time did she leave? About five-thirty. What time is it now? - I don't know. - Stupid! Look at the clock. The clock is dead. Idiot. But the sun just set. Open the window. Señora, it's cold. It's bad for your health. Do as I say! Cranky old woman! What are you saying? Nothing, ma'am. Just praying. I was cooking when the Angelus sounded. I forgot to pray. Well, what are you standing there for? Señorita said that when you woke up I should give you your dinner. What? Those were her orders. No one can close that window. And no one can serve me food but Señorita Rosenda. Eek! What is it, Felisa? It's a good thing you've arrived. Where are you taking those? Bring them back to the kitchen. Yes, ma'am. Felisa left the window open. Only you will close that window. Only you will serve me my meals. Why did you suddenly change your routine today? Every single day you've opened the window, fed me, bathed me. You clean this room. Why did it suddenly change today? Maybe it was Felisa who changed the flowers in the vase. This change is very sudden. It doesn't mean anything. You even sound different. I've never heard you speak like that. Did you really only start today? It's the fifth day of my novena. The fifth? Then you've been leaving for five days? The novena is my diversion. Diversion? That's a sacrilege. The church is not a diversion. I'll change, then I'll bring your dinner. Have you lost your patience? Mama? Are you tired of me? Señorita, we need to get a gardener. I can't manage it by myself. Like I said, find someone to help you. I don't know anyone. I'm afraid of Señora. When she heard about the last gardener, she kept yelling at me. I nearly had a heart attack. Tomorrow we'll have a new gardener. He can help with your chores. - I thought you didn't know anyone. - I met someone. When? In church. On the first day of my novena. Five days ago. Who is he? His name is Miguelito. Ma'am! You left your umbrella. Thank you. What is it? I'm new to this city. I don't know anyone here. I'm hungry. Take this. Go on. Thank you. On the third day I saw him again on the patio. He looked better. Decent. Good afternoon. Good day. I've been waiting for you, Ma'am. Why? I've found a job as a gardener at that house. Gardener? That's good. - I want to thank you for... - It's nothing. Ma'am! My name is Miguelito. The next day I saw him again. He tried to pay me back. I didn't want to take it, but he said he was no beggar. I saw him again yesterday. He was sad. He said his employer was cruel. Treated him badly. Poor man. I thought I was the most miserable person on earth. Señora is terrible, but you treat me kindly. Tomorrow I'll offer him the job. I'll see him tomorrow. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with Thee, blessed art Thou amongst women... Felisa, your Señorita will be the one to pick the flowers for my vase. Go to bed, Felisa. Yes, go to bed. I'm not growing taller or heavier, but it seems you're having trouble lifting me. I just feel a bit weak. Tomorrow have Felisa call Roberto. I will ask for a new prescription. I notice you've been fragile lately. I passed by the doctor's house earlier. He sends his regards. He hasn't been here in a while. I hear he was ill. He's lost weight. Why didn't you mention it? What was his illness? Our family doctor is old, Mama. Old age. Poor Roberto. There is no cure for old age. And he only has a servant to keep him company. Not like me. I'm lucky to have one daughter to care for me. Good night, Mama. I'll send for the doctor tomorrow. Good night, dear. I thought I was going to expire from illness. Roberto. So I changed my last will. Changed it? Why not? My ungrateful children have all married and moved away. I don't even know who they married. They've forgotten me. When I was ill, not one of them visited me. That's what hurts. They grow up and forget. Who will you leave your possessions to in case... I die? My children will not see a penny of it. And I will rest in peace. That's right. I'd do the same thing. You do your duty to them, but they abandon their duty to you. Rosenda. I brought some hot cocoa. I missed your hot cocoa when I was ailing. Excellent! Just the right mixture! I asked my servant to prepare some, but she couldn't get it. Before you enjoy the cocoa, give me a new prescription. Oh! right, for your backache. Now I believe you. You did the right thing with Rosenda. If you didn't restrain her, who would care for you? If only I'd listened to you... You can't blame me. When her father died, I was afraid of the people around me. I didn't want to remarry. You were right. Rosenda looks after me, so she inherits all my money. I'm close to death. I feel it. But I've known only one truly wise person, and that's you. Good afternoon! It's you. Come in. Good day to you. I'm here. Your garden seems fine. Felisa needs help around the house. She'll tell you what to do. I think she'll have you clean your room first. You're drenched in sweat. Yes, Ma'am, it's very hot. Where is Ma'am Felisa? Sit down, I'll prepare your snack. Come here and eat. This is such a big house. There's only three of us here. It feels like a cemetery. There's only three of you? Yes. Señora Atang, Señorita Rosenda and me. Good thing we're four now. You know why I'm the only maid? The old woman is so cranky. She's mad. All the servants leave. But things are changing. Señorita's starting to go out. Unlike before when she was like a monk. Only went out to go to church. The old woman is an invalid. I'm only biding my time. I think the old woman will go soon. This is just between us. Are they rich? Filthy rich. They're an old San Juan family. And the luckiest is our Señorita. She's the sole heir to their fortune. You hired a young bachelor for a gardener? If Felisa didn't get help, she might've left us. Stupid! What does he look like? I don't look at his face. Fine. Have him stay in the storeroom. That's where I put him. He can only come into the house when he has chores. Will he join our nightly rosary? No. Only Roberto can come in here. Señorita! A snake! Oh my God! Be careful, Miguelito! Here it is! Where are you? I'm here. What are you doing there? I'm fixing something. I have to go out. Where to? Señorita's sending me to the doctor's house. He died today. I don't know what Señora will do when she finds out. That doctor was like family to her. He was the only man she ever spoke to. I'll go with you. Never mind. Just don't go out. Look after the house. I'll be out till late. Yes, I'll take care of everything. The vase was broken. This is where I keep the vases. Let me lift that. Here it is. Ungrateful wretches! I thought your mother was a cripple. I'll call a doctor. Where am I? You shameless wretch! Ingrate! How could you be with that man? You disobeyed me. I'm ashamed of you. After all I've done for you. You're the shameless one. I did everything you asked. On my wedding day I left the man I loved because you were crippled. But you're not really a cripple. I gave you my youth, and you call me ungrateful! Your money won't make up for what you've done to me. I'd have to hire someone to look after me when I'm old like you. I never complained all these years, and now I'm the ingrate? What is left to me? What future? Tomorrow is dark because of your cruelty! Why did you do this to me? What did I do to you? My heart, my heart. My servitude is finished. - Water. - You want water? Here's a glass. You can walk. Take it. Roberto, call Roberto. He's dead. - Liar! - You're the liar. Die. Die. Thank you, Doctor. What luck... What great good luck. I'll marry Rosenda, then... I'm a lucky man. Rosenda? Rosenda?
