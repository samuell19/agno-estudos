Drop the socks. You're gonna find somebody. Not one of these fuckboy riffraffs that comes crawling up in here all sweaty. No, not one of those. Not one of those sweaty guys. You're gonna find someone that treats you like a queen. You think so? I do. By the tip of these French tips. There we go. You know, I just hope he's as good a man as Vinny, 'cause that man... he's got a cock like this. And you know, I've seen him put up a TV in under, like, 20 seconds, I swear to God. What's up, ladies?

Your body aches from a pain you can't explain I wish I could be the change But you need somebody brave Your mind, it wanders like a bird Without its wings, if I could give you anything Just a free-falling grace Just keep your head up Even when there's too much weight Go each time, don't wait for fate You know I could do you wrong That's my fault, I'm a stupid one Hi. Howdy. Can I help you? I can manage. Thanks. Okay, well, you know, if you need anything, I'm... here. Sweet car you got out there. Thanks, Ponyboi. How do you know my name? Oh, right. I'm Bruce. Like Springsteen You a fan Every Jersey girl is. Tell you what. There is something you could do for me. My buddy, Phil, referred me. Thought I might have a little fun before I head to Vegas tomorrow. Oh. Phil's a good guy. You ever been to Vegas? Mm, no, but... I've always wanted to go, um, if I ever got married, on my honeymoon or something. I know it's a stupid dream. No. I'm a sucker for those pretty lights myself. So, um, what do you say... Ponyboi Sorry. It's a bit of a shit show in here. I like it. Very... you. What's the deal with that name I know your mama didn't name you Ponyboi. No, um... my daddy did. And how'd he ever come up with that? Well, when I was little, I... hated going to the doctor's. And I loved ponies, so whenever I went with my dad, he said if I was a good boy, he'd get me a pony. And did he ever get you one? No, but, um... we'd go to the boardwalk arcade, and we'd win knockoff My Little Ponies. Over there. That's quite a collection you got there. Why were you at the doctor's so much? I guess I was... born a little different. That's okay. I like that you're different. Want some music? You know, I've seen you before. Oh, yeah? In a dream. You're crazy. I'm serious. Hmm. I feel like a prom queen. Imagine us... rolling up in that white Mustang of yours. Oh, that old thing. I love that old thing. It's yours if you want it. Don't fuck with me. You can have whatever you want. You just have to think you deserve it. What do you want, Ponyboi? Too many nights... The doctor's gonna help you be a man. - Don't you wanna be a man - No! 12-year-old intersex male. He needs surgical intervention. We'll always be in love Don't fear Too young to feel this way Too young to run away Too young My Little Pony! Hey. You good? Oh, yeah. I am better than ever. You fucking reek. You know you like it. Where's Angel? I dropped her off at my place. Puked at Red Lobster. What the fuck? She's, uh... she's pregnant. What? - Mm. Looks like I'm gonna be a daddy. You know you want Daddy's dick. S... st... Where you going? "Ponyboi, "meet me at the boardwalk. Yours, Bruce." Baby, baby, baby, I'm sorry. W-wait, where you going? Get the fuck off me. No, what, are you just gonna run away again? Get the fuck off me! You won't last a second out there before you start sucking dicks in bathrooms. You know why 'cause that's all you're fucking good for. Well, you're just a closeted fucking loser. And you're gonna be a terrible fucking father. I don't know whether to fuck you... like a bitch... or a faggot. There she goes Under the sun Some question there...
