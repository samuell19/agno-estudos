This is just wrong. ﻿Someone has to tell him those aren't his grandpa's ashes. ﻿Shut up, Tsufi. Not a word. ﻿Besides, what does it matter? ﻿Look how sad he is. ﻿Who cares whose grandpa he is? ﻿Ashes are ashes. ﻿Yaki! -Shut your trap! -Shut up, idiot! ﻿What's going on? ﻿I'll kick your ass, moron! -Leave him alone! ﻿It's always been this way. ﻿They're children. ﻿You drive me nuts! ﻿Faster, Grandpa! Don't be scared! ﻿As fast as you can! ﻿As fast as you can! ﻿Rabin, here we come... ﻿Stop fighting! ﻿Kleers, watch your mouth. ﻿Morad, don't listen to him. ﻿I know I'm only Yaki's grandpa ﻿but I feel like everyone's grandpa. ﻿Even yours, Aya. ﻿Yaki, you're going to sing for Prime Minister Rabin ﻿and you better not screw up. ﻿You're beautiful and it's gonna be perfect. ﻿Beautiful, my ass. ﻿Kleers, put a cork in it! ﻿Be like a fist, don't stop singing. ﻿The Fist. -The Fist! -The Fist. -The Fist! ﻿The Fist! -The Fist! ﻿Kleers, you're not singing. I can't trust you. ﻿Dump the trash and cheer them on from the sidelines. ﻿Welcome Mr. Prime Minister ﻿Places, boys, Get ready. We go live in three, ﻿two, one... ﻿The autumn night falls on the Negev ﻿Kindling stars silently ﻿When the wind blows through the doorway... ﻿Yaki, Tsufi, are you in or out? ﻿Did your grandpa teach you to lose? ﻿Shut up! ﻿Kleers, Morad, you're all in. ﻿Show your hands. ﻿Just a sec, I gotta pee. ﻿Be right back. ﻿Pee? Now? ﻿What is this crap? ﻿What's going on, Morad? ﻿You don't walk out on a game. ﻿Morad! ﻿Dear pupils, remember, tonight at 6:00 ﻿is the Purim party in the courtyard. ﻿Did you tell Kleers about us? ﻿He'll figure it out soon enough. ﻿Ready? -I was born ready. ﻿Good luck. ﻿Who turned off the power? -Go, go, go! -What's going on? ﻿No, no, no... Get back here! ﻿I have four aces, get back here! ﻿What're you looking at? ﻿But I won! ﻿Shut your mouth! ﻿Aya? ﻿I love you. ﻿I love you too. ﻿You're aren't getting back with him, are you? ﻿No way, he's trash. ﻿My grandfather... ﻿built this country. ﻿He was many things. ﻿He had many friends. ﻿That meant a lot to him. ﻿He loved them. ﻿He was very demanding of me. ﻿He didn't care about school, money. ﻿He wanted me to be a good person. ﻿Even if... ﻿he taught me the hard way sometimes, ﻿I loved him. ﻿Maybe he... ﻿loved me too. ﻿You've Been Chosen ﻿We're honored to invite you to the game of the century ﻿Texas Hold'em - Four vs. Four for 1,000,000 shekels ﻿Shut up. ﻿We're going to reconnoiter Oren Kleers' bar. ﻿He's got a big poker game happening. ﻿Does the Chief know she needs thicker walls? ﻿Why? -Because you eavesdrop. ﻿This is how you sound: ﻿I fell asleep. How did the movie end? Did she blow him? ﻿It's not our case. Remember what happened last time? ﻿We saved a boy's life? ﻿If I beat you this round, we go. ﻿Fuck! Must've been a blank. ﻿I'm still reporting the guys in the armory. ﻿Let's go! ﻿Beber Reuveni. ﻿Sorry for asking, but were you friends? ﻿Family, Mr. Incinerator, "The Fist." ﻿Big urn. ﻿He weighed 450 lbs, ﻿you want them to put him in a cup? ﻿My condolences. ﻿One last thing, ﻿I highly recommend not looking into the urn. ﻿Of course. ﻿Just a sec. ﻿What're you doing? ﻿I want to take a look. ﻿Are you crazy? Beber will fall out. ﻿He won't fall out. ﻿It's human ash, dude. I gotta see this. ﻿The opening was on the bottom. ﻿You're a bright one. ﻿You're covered in Beber. ﻿I'm all Beber-ed out, man. ﻿What do we do? ﻿Secret poker game, huh? ﻿Can you believe this? ﻿Why'd they make the envelope so fancy? ﻿It's a million shekels, Morad. And there are four of us. ﻿Yaki's in mourning. We're only three. ﻿We always wanted to know how good we are, right? ﻿Here's our chance, it's a gift from God. ﻿Let's sign up, we have a chance. ﻿Yaki will understand. ﻿Can I tell you no? -Morad... ﻿Do you have the urn? -Let's get out of here. ﻿Close it. ﻿Shouldn't we tell Yaki we're checking out the game? ﻿What if I say: ﻿Wow, that's tight on you. ﻿Harassment. ﻿What if I say: Good job. ﻿Cool. -You sexy thing. ﻿Harassment. ﻿You're a wild animal, Hili. ﻿Lousy personality but a wild animal. ﻿Can it, virgin. ﻿Look who's here... ﻿Who is she and why should I care? -Racheli Shimoni. Works for Kleers. ﻿The Chief's gonna have your ass. ﻿It's not our shift, not our case, you fucking moron. ﻿Who cares if it's our case?! ﻿This case will make us big, Gilden, if you don't act like a wiener-dog. ﻿Did they open the envelope? ﻿Did it go smooth? ﻿I already told you, yes. ﻿Still cheating with that pack? ﻿Only when I have to. ﻿Can I go? ﻿When all four are signed up. ﻿Why four? ﻿Where'd that come from? ﻿One guy's grandpa died, Beber Reuveni. ﻿He's mourning, he won't come. ﻿Fat Beber died? ﻿See why nobody can work with you? ﻿It's like talking to a wall. C'mon, Oren, ﻿I covered my debt. Keep your word ﻿and let me go... ﻿No way ﻿do you tell me what to do. ﻿You're stupid. ﻿Your debt is paid when I say so. ﻿I need all four, and it's your job to get them! ﻿So his grandpa died?! ﻿Deal with it. ﻿Hey, who are they? ﻿With a little luck, these clowns like poker. ﻿Wow, you are cute... ﻿and tall! -Let's go home. ﻿Tomorrow morning well... -No! ﻿I'm 20 feet away from the hottest case in the department ﻿and I know I can handle it. ﻿I just have to find out if there is game ﻿and where it is. ﻿Gilden... ﻿Fine. Fuck off and die. ﻿Benson, this is what I call a bar. ﻿Anybody home? ﻿Not a soul, man. ﻿Want a drink? ﻿You sure this is the place? -I dunno. ﻿Morad Nimni. ﻿Aya Shickler. ﻿It's been years. ﻿Nineteen. ﻿But who's counting? ﻿You said you'd wait for me. ﻿You got married the day you were discharged. ﻿I didn't even get an invitation. ﻿And now he's divorced. ﻿What's up, Morad? ﻿I hear Beber died. ﻿Bummer. ﻿Poor Yaki, huh? ﻿Oren Kleers. ﻿Benson. ﻿Oren Kleers? ﻿You're with him? ﻿You know, if you're with him, ﻿your son will murder Jews ﻿and your daughter will be a whore. ﻿Can I tell you something? ﻿Don't get mad. -I don't wanna be here. ﻿Aya, wait. ﻿Aya. ﻿Morad, ﻿we've been together for three months. ﻿She came home after 10 years in Belgium, I grabbed her at the airport, ﻿I leave no room for error. ﻿It's a match made in heaven. ﻿We cry together at movies, Morad. ﻿I'm not trying to hurt you ﻿or pour salt in your wounds, not at all. ﻿Aya ﻿is the love of my life. ﻿You aren't angry, are you? ﻿I want to turn over a new leaf. ﻿Is that so? -Seriously. ﻿That's why I invited you to the tournament. ﻿It's exclusive, two days in a hotel, a pool, fancy bar, the whole nine yards. ﻿Registration isn't cheap, ﻿but there's a million waiting for you at the end. ﻿People already placed bets. ﻿How can you turn that down? ﻿Suck my dick. ﻿Let's get outta here. ﻿You were full of shit last time, too. ﻿That's how you return a favor? ﻿Beat it, chicken. ﻿That's why Aya dumped you, 'cause you're chicken. ﻿I'm chicken? -You sure are! -I'm chicken? C'mon, ﻿let's play, just you and me. ﻿Deal, big man. ﻿Let's see you beat me. -Sit down! ﻿I'm playing him, he's full of hot air. ﻿Don't, Morad, it's a trap. ﻿Don't play with him. ﻿Morad. Morad... ﻿Back already, Morad? ﻿Listen here, Morad. ﻿If you don't care about your car I don't either, ﻿but you do, so I do too. ﻿Y'know what I'm sayin'? ﻿I'm not sure. ﻿Don't bet your car. ﻿Morad! ﻿Back for more? -Shut up and deal. ﻿I'll suck his blood! ﻿Through a straw! ﻿We're going to that game, y'hear? ﻿Morad, count me out. ﻿I'm not losing my pants for anyone. ﻿I'm not coming. -Say that again and I'll spit fire at you. ﻿Can't you see I need you? ﻿Go get your scooter and pick me and Tsufi up from my car. ﻿Oren's car. ﻿My right nut's car. ﻿Whoa, it's a bombshell. Call the bomb squad. ﻿How's it going? ﻿Everything okay? -Hold on, hold on... ﻿Sorry. ﻿I always wanted to sit in one of these. ﻿Comfy! ﻿Much comfier than you'd expect. ﻿Racheli Shimoni. Looking for a ride. ﻿Boom. -Benson. Bar owner. ﻿What happened to your head? Looks bad... ﻿Sorry. ﻿Didn't mean to hurt you. -I ran into some glass. ﻿Happens too much lately. ﻿You know Kleers? -Did him a few favors. ﻿I don't really know him. ﻿Did he say you play together? ﻿No, no. ﻿Why do you ask? -No reason, ﻿I'm going away next week ﻿and I might be bartending, make a few bucks. ﻿Love the blond. -Thanks. -Brings out your personality. ﻿Well, I'm off. ﻿Where are you from, anyway? -Jabotinsky St. ﻿Never heard of it. ﻿You should smile more often. ﻿You sure you're not going? ﻿Of course I'm going. ﻿Does 8:00 a.m. tomorrow work for you? -Works. ﻿G'night, Jabotinsky. -G'night. ﻿Why don't you leave them alone? ﻿Find some serious players, your caliber, so we can make some money. ﻿Why waste it all just to get revenge ﻿for something that happened 20 years ago? ﻿I dunno. ﻿Childhood flashback. ﻿Let's move on. ﻿You won. ﻿You have it all. ﻿You have me. ﻿You have money. ﻿Isn't that enough? ﻿No. ﻿I want to beat them at the table. ﻿All of them! ﻿Where it matters, where it counts, ﻿where it hurts! ﻿I want to leave them with nothing! ﻿No friends, no money, ﻿no dignity, nothing! ﻿Dust! ﻿Okay? -No, it's not okay and you're being a baby. ﻿Where's the game, anyway? ﻿I want to be there to protect you. ﻿You're not coming and I'm not telling you where. ﻿It's cash on the table, it's illegal and I don't want you involved. ﻿Babe... ﻿I'm coming to the game. ﻿What's gonna be? ﻿Whose is bigger? ﻿Morad, ﻿do yourself a favor. ﻿Kleers is a big boy now. ﻿Stay away. ﻿C'mon, Aya, ﻿let's grab a taxi and get outta here. ﻿Take off our clothes, talk about old times. ﻿Bye, Morad. ﻿Don't go to the game. ﻿She slipped through your fingers, doofus. ﻿Nazi bastard. ﻿Fuck everyone. ﻿Her name's Racheli. -Whose? ﻿The hottie from the funeral. She's going to the game. ﻿I dunno, Benson, it smells fishy. ﻿Don't be a jerk, it'll be awesome. ﻿Kleers will eat his heart out. ﻿I'll beat that prick for sure. ﻿I'm telling you, I'll beat... ﻿Evening, bitches. Pull over. ﻿So none of you heard about Oren Kleers or a secret poker game? ﻿Where's the game? ﻿Where's the game? ﻿Where is the game? We saw you talking to a girl. ﻿She's not involved. She's my girlfriend. ﻿She settled for less. ﻿She hangs out with crooks, gamblers, you name it. ﻿I told you it smelled fishy. ﻿Bullshit. She bartends for him. ﻿She's leaving the country soon. ﻿Crooks, my ass. ﻿We don't know anything. Can we go? ﻿Hold on. You know that women are better at solving crimes? ﻿Here he goes... ﻿You work better under pressure, ﻿you have better psychological skills, ﻿you communicate better, ﻿you move, you dance. ﻿You've got a good job. You're gorgeous. ﻿What's your problem? -The bastard startled me. ﻿Can we go? -Who's stopping you? ﻿What's with you, Gilden? ﻿You like your blue eyes, huh? ﻿Got 'em from my mother. ﻿Can I get your number? ﻿Gimme your phone. ﻿"Gimme your phone"? ﻿"Gimme your ph..." ﻿You just tapped his phone without authorization. ﻿I've got wood. -Harassment. ﻿The Chiefs gonna kill you. Hili, let's go home, ﻿we'll pick up the prisoner first thing in the morning, ﻿play it simple, beer at 4:00. ﻿We'll pick up the prisoner, ﻿but we'll take him along for observation. Gilden, ﻿you need to grow some cojones... ﻿of bronze. ﻿We'll do it under the Chief's nose ﻿and we'll nail Oren Kleers. ﻿Oren Kleers, we'll catch him red-handed, it's the case of the century! ﻿You ass, you fool, you twerp, you lame-o! ﻿You think the Chief will care how we did it? ﻿Idiot! -Tell me exactly how that felt. -That was good. ﻿Who ordered what? ﻿I don't care. ﻿Beber Reuveni RIP ﻿What do we tell Yaki? -Nothing. ﻿No matter what we say he won't come. ﻿Well tell Yaki the truth, about Kleers, about the game, ﻿he's mourning, show some respect. ﻿Yaki. ﻿Yaki, we're here... ﻿You know... ﻿To give you... ﻿our condolences. ﻿How you doin'? ﻿Aren't you mourning? Where're you going? ﻿I'm going south in my grandpa's jalopy. ﻿To scatter his ashes. ﻿I still can't believe he was cremated. ﻿Relax. Beber had every STD there is. ﻿He'd either burn here or in hell... ﻿Sorry, man. He was my grandpa, too. ﻿Ours. ﻿We're all mourning, Yaki. ﻿Who cremates Jews, anyway? That's so primitive. ﻿It's just wrong. -Shut up... ﻿Why'd you bring luggage? ﻿We're... ﻿coming with you, of course. ﻿Obviously. ﻿Beber's fist! ﻿Love you guys... ﻿Wah-wah. ﻿Marco Wah-Wah, ﻿the Brinks terror. ﻿What's your story, Marco? ﻿It's all a bluff. ﻿Say, do you use face cream? ﻿Did they find the money you hid? You loser. ﻿Yeah, right. ﻿You're going on a field trip today. ﻿If you behave I'll let you open a window. ﻿Let's move. Do we have a location? ﻿Yeah, but why can't we hear them? ﻿What's Yaki doing on the roof? ﻿Tying on the urn. ﻿What a mess. We can't keep a secret. ﻿It'll all come out wrong and there goes the game. ﻿Don't worry about it, Tsufi. ﻿You and Benson keep quiet and he'll find out when we tell him. ﻿He's miserable as it is. ﻿Here he comes. ﻿Ready? -Yeah. ﻿Before we go let's make one thing clear. ﻿This is a happy journey. ﻿My grandpa wanted me to scatter his ashes in the South ﻿so I'd get to know Israel better. ﻿Look, he left a map. ﻿He marked stops, left details, ﻿and at the end he wrote: Have fun. ﻿Get the idea? -Totally. ﻿Take the spare keys. ﻿FYI, we're picking up my girlfriend. ﻿Whoa, Benson! ﻿You got a girlfriend, Benson? ﻿Congratulations, man. ﻿Is she leather or rubber? ﻿Son of a bitch... ﻿Hello, Racheli. ﻿What a doofus. ﻿Poor guy's nervous. ﻿Hi.-Hi. ﻿Thanks for the ride. -Don't mention it. ﻿Listen, Yaki doesn't know about the poker game. ﻿He's sensitive, with the funeral and everything, ﻿okay? -Got it, but are you gonna tell him? -Of course. ﻿And they think we're together. ﻿Just slipped out. ﻿Benson scored, huh? ﻿Shall we? -Sure. -Let's go. ﻿Can you get that? -Sure. ﻿Hey, everyone. -You guys, this is Racheli. ﻿Hey, Yaki. You must be Tsufi ﻿You're a few sizes too big for him, Racheli. ﻿Ignore him, he's detoxing. ﻿Where to, Yaki? ﻿Here it comes... ﻿First stop, Hulda Forest. -Yes! ﻿This case is a pig in a poke. ﻿There's a guy named Abdallah Ben-Artzi there. -Who are you following? ﻿Why don't you take me to jail? I have arts and crafts today. ﻿Shut up, Wah-Wah. ﻿If I tell you where I buried the money ﻿will you let me go? -No. -Of course. Now? ﻿Racheli, let me introduce the guys, ﻿I can see you're guessing. ﻿This is Morad Nimni, No. 4 at the docks. ﻿Divorced, brokenhearted. ﻿And that's Yaki, chocolate skin and a heart of gold. ﻿What about Tsufi? -Rich. His dad has an island in Peru. ﻿It's the Faroe Islands, numbnuts. ﻿What bullshit... ﻿And Benson you've met. ﻿I'll just mention that... -Quiet, Yaki. ﻿You play guitar, Racheli? ﻿You know D minor? ﻿Will you play us a ditty? ﻿I only know happy songs. ﻿Inappropriate. -Why? Perfectly appropriate. ﻿All right, then. ﻿Good thing I came. ﻿Know this one? Will you join me? ﻿We stand at the piano and learn to sing together ﻿But my voice walks alone in a song of another day ﻿In the Promised Land swaying back and forth... ﻿Hey, you guys are good. ﻿You kidding? "The Band" is our favorite movie. ﻿That and "Goodbye Meital." ﻿I remember when I came in to audition ﻿I forgot everything, words and music ﻿And I thought: All is lost ﻿I don't stand a chance, I'm going back to my battalion ﻿I'm going back to my battalion! ﻿I always wanted to be a dancing, singing soldier ﻿I wanted to be a funny, happy guy ﻿Who smiles and sings sing-along songs ﻿Even if he's terrified deep inside... ﻿To live three years minute by minute ﻿With the whole ba-a-a-and ﻿- Ben-Artzi Ranch - With the whole ba-a-a-and... ﻿Maybe there's nobody here. ﻿Let's get outta here. ﻿Dude, he shot her ear off. ﻿Yaki broke the sign. ﻿Confess, Yaki. ﻿Are you Abdallah? ﻿Listen, we're sorry... ﻿It's a tall van and I didn't see it and it's on... ﻿a slope... -He broke the sign. ﻿Yaki, gimme the sign and I'll jump him. ﻿Yaki, buddy, how you've grown! ﻿Where's Beber? Is he with you? ﻿Abdallah... ﻿Grandpa's dead. ﻿Abdallah Ben-Artzi. ﻿Worked for the Nature Authority, IDF officer, ﻿decorated for bravery. ﻿Amateur. ﻿Totally Israeli. ﻿Arrested 40 times for violence, suspicion of drug trafficking, ﻿auto theft and revenge for a death in the family. ﻿Vegetarian. ﻿Abdallah, ﻿I didn't mean to tell you like this. ﻿There's one way to receive bad news ﻿and it's by surprise. ﻿See that horse? ﻿Fine horse. Arabian. They never give up. ﻿Doesn't it hate to be tied up? ﻿Maybe not. ﻿Here, ﻿for old times' sake. ﻿What? ﻿Is this Beber? ﻿Some of him. ﻿I remember when he came up to the stage after they dumped the garbage on you. ﻿He hugged you. ﻿My dad loved him. ﻿Y'know, ﻿talking about him breaks my heart. ﻿Where are you going from here? ﻿To Ein Gedi. ﻿Heading south. ﻿In that van? ﻿No. ﻿That van's had it. Leave it here. ﻿Take one of mine. -No... ﻿It's a gift. ﻿Show them the car. ﻿Take the gray one. ﻿Which? -The gray one. -The gray one! ﻿Which gray one? This gray one? -The gray one. ﻿Hold on... ﻿Thanks, Abdallah, but my grandpa left me the van, ﻿I can't leave it here. ﻿Abdallah, we'll take it. ﻿Yaki, you'll get over it. It's worth twice the inheritance. ﻿Abdallah said something about ﻿my grandpa hugging me after some garbage was dumped. ﻿Does that ring a bell? ﻿I just remember he was mad at you because you stopped singing. ﻿I remember the song "Brotherhood," I remember garbage being dumped ﻿and I deleted the rest. ﻿The autumn night falls... ﻿Will you shut up? ﻿That song's off-limits. ﻿Shouldn't we tell Yaki about the game? ﻿We'll tell him tomorrow morning. ﻿Don't worry about it. ﻿I'm hungry. Are you? ﻿See if there's anything besides the lousy pot noodles. ﻿Sure, I'm hungry. ﻿Tsufi! ﻿See if there's something to nibble back there. ﻿Oopsie... ﻿What is this? ﻿Is this Abdallah's? ﻿It's full of Tylenols. ﻿You mean ecstasy. ﻿Must be Abdallah's. What'll we do with it? ﻿We either get high... ﻿or sell it to Uzi Babel. ﻿Who's Uzi Babel? -Some dealer. That Abdallah... ﻿is no fool. ﻿But forget that, I'm hungry. Pot noodles? ﻿She's stopping. -Well? ﻿Want some? ﻿Well what? They're all asleep. ﻿Gilden spikes their pot noodles with MDMA and gets out of there. ﻿Piece of cake. ﻿Are you really considering it? ﻿Drug them for information. Espionage 101. ﻿They'll tell us where the game is. ﻿You want to get this over with? ﻿Let's get it over with. ﻿The Chief'll have your ass. Life sentence. ﻿Same for your wiretap. ﻿You don't tell, I won't tell. -Let's stop, make some coffee, ﻿look at the stars. ﻿Tsufi, where's your phone? ﻿I'm taking it, my battery's dead. ﻿He's asleep. Can't talk to him. ﻿I'm going in. Keep an eye out. ﻿Wait, I forgot the pot noodles. ﻿Shit! Gilden, Racheli's going back... ﻿Fast as lightning. -How many did you give each one? ﻿Three. -You could kill them! -You wanna close this case? ﻿They'll be fine. Piece of cake. ﻿To Grandpa Beber. -To Beber. ﻿Cheers. -To Beber. ﻿Last stop, Ein Gedi, 5 miles from here. ﻿There's a guy named Bobby there, friend of Grandpa's. ﻿I love your grandpa's friends. ﻿Hey... ﻿what were you saying about garbage? ﻿Racheli, why don't you eat some dirt? ﻿Leave her alone. ﻿Why rub salt in our wounds, Racheli? ﻿Look at this place. ﻿Look at this beautiful bonfire you made. ﻿Soon the stars will come out, ﻿the Big Bear, the Little Bear. ﻿When did you last have sex? -None of your business. ﻿A month? Two? More? ﻿Could it be a year? ﻿Hili? -That's Officer Rosen to you. ﻿Maybe more than a year, maybe less... ﻿None of your business. -Wah, wah. ﻿Prison conditions. -May lightning strike me twice ﻿if that's not the craziest thing I ever heard. ﻿Is it a medical issue? -No, it's not medical issue! ﻿When's that ecstasy supposed to kick in? ﻿Yaki... ﻿Yaki's dead... ﻿Yaki's dead, Yaki's dead, Yaki's dead... ﻿They could be talking about the game ﻿and we're stuck here like herrings. ﻿Gilden, go turn down the music. ﻿I can't hear a thing! ﻿Your turn. ﻿I'm not budging. ﻿I want some gum! ﻿Me too! ﻿I want six pieces of gum! ﻿get some from the car. ﻿Get some for Larry, too. -Who's Larry? ﻿Yaki, you're alive! ﻿You know what Grandpa just told me? ﻿He ate a dog! ﻿Oh, no! -Yes. ﻿You guys won't believe this... ﻿I'm wasted, man. You're scattering my ashes here tomorrow. ﻿Hello? ﻿Morad? ﻿Who is this? -Aya. ﻿Who dialed her? ﻿I'm with a beautiful policewoman. ﻿This is awesome. ﻿Aya? Are you there? ﻿What's so funny? ﻿I must betripping if I think I'm talking to you. ﻿You are talking to me. ﻿Forget everything, please forget everything... ﻿This was all in your head. ﻿What? -You raped a suspect. ﻿No I didn't, and it isn't rape. ﻿Whoa. Wake up. ﻿Wake up! ﻿Man, I'm wasted. ﻿I've got cottonmouth. ﻿You have to drink. ﻿You can't play if you're dehydrated. ﻿Play what? ﻿Poke... ﻿Fuck. ﻿Something you want to tell me? ﻿Yaki. -Yes, Benson? ﻿Your grandpa wants us to be The Fist, ﻿right? ﻿Like Cahane's flag, a fist. ﻿And since we're The Fist, ﻿we thought we could... ﻿win a poker game tonight. ﻿I'm scattering my grandpa's ashes, heartbroken, ﻿and you're talking about poker? ﻿What's your problem? ﻿How can you even think about cards now? ﻿So you aren't coming? ﻿Morad, ﻿tell him. ﻿It's against Oren Kleers. ﻿Aya Shickler's there, too. ﻿Y'hear me? Aya Shickler! ﻿It's amazing, ﻿she hasn't changed a bit in 20 years. ﻿Gimme the keys, Morad. ﻿Come on, Yaki. ﻿Yaki... ﻿Are you just gonna leave us here? -Yes. ﻿Where's the car? ﻿Someone stole our car. ﻿Gilden, someone stole their car. ﻿Gilden. Gilden! -I'm awake. ﻿I gather Marco's still asleep. -Someone stole their car ﻿right under our noses! ﻿We're the worst cops in the world. -Hold on, I'll wake him up. ﻿Someone stole their car. ﻿A little Bedouin on an Arabian horse. I saw him. ﻿Okay. Gilden, wipe your drool. ﻿Well wait for them in Ein Gedi. ﻿I hope we get there soon. -But they're both gray! ﻿I'll bet Abdallah took it. ﻿Who was guarding it? -Racheli. -Shut up! ﻿How could you slip me ecstasy ﻿when I'm detoxing?! ﻿I'm AA! ﻿Tsufi. Chill. -"C'mon, ﻿"let's pull over, make some coffee, look at the stars." ﻿I knew something ﻿was wrong with her. -Fine, then I'll go. ﻿Don't go. Shut up, Tsufi! ﻿You killed me. ﻿Grandfather and grandson died the same week. ﻿Where's the money for the game? ﻿Don't tell me... -It's history! ﻿We're so fucked! ﻿I can't believe this! ﻿At least we still have the drugs. ﻿Wait... Racheli, ﻿what was that dealer's name? ﻿We can sell all these pills. ﻿You mean Uzi Babel? ﻿I never really met him, I just tried his stuff. ﻿Screw the money. Let's visit your grandpa's friend, ﻿take a shower and then figure it out. ﻿How do we get to Ein Gedi? ﻿By camel. ﻿Is your phone charged? Why? -I could call Uzi Babel. ﻿-I could call Uzi Babel. ﻿Why're you so worried? -What? ﻿I'm not, I just want this to work out for you. ﻿Because if we don't play you won't get to work the bar? ﻿Racheli, if you need money I'll give you some. ﻿You're so patronizing. ﻿Why do you assume I'm only thinking of myself? ﻿And why would I need money? ﻿Why do you look at me like a lost orphan? ﻿And why would I need someone... -Relax, Racheli! ﻿I didn't mean it. Sorry. ﻿I just wanted to help. ﻿Never mind. ﻿My own issues. ﻿Maybe I'll just go. ﻿I've spent too much time with you. ﻿What's this number? ﻿The game's in Arad. Yes! ﻿Arad! Gilden, you jerk, it's happening! ﻿Racheli! ﻿Are you sure you want to leave? ﻿I'll meet you at the hotel in Arad. We'll talk there. ﻿Just... ﻿promise me... ﻿you'll make up with Yaki. ﻿If you say it the right way he'll come, ﻿he'll realize ﻿he'll enjoy the game. ﻿Can you drop me off here? ﻿Fuck. ﻿I'm telling the Chief it's in Arad. ﻿Bad idea. She'll ask how you know. -Sent. ﻿Don't worry about it. ﻿Hello? ﻿Yes, Chief. ﻿Yes, Chief. ﻿Yes, but... ﻿I'd rather not say who... ﻿We're heading there now. ﻿I understand. ﻿Whatever you say. ﻿As soon as we get there. ﻿Marco, make room for Hili. Her career is over. ﻿She just gave us the case. ﻿Are you okay, Yaki? ﻿Chill, Benson. ﻿Racheli's gone. ﻿Tsufi, shut up. ﻿Hit the gas, we'll follow Racheli's bus. ﻿Well be in Arad in half an hour. ﻿Still into your rape victim? ﻿Is his ginormous? -Yes. ﻿He's living it up, huh? ﻿Who is this guy, anyway? ﻿Bobby Nachmani, a friend of my grandpa's. ﻿He wrote that he had good times here. ﻿Hi.-Hi. -We're looking for Bobby Nachmani. ﻿I'm Bobby Nachmani. ﻿Wow, you look just like... -Beber Reuveni. ﻿Fat guy, ate a dog once. ﻿Ask her about Uzi Babel. ﻿I'm Beber's grandson. ﻿Yaki... ﻿You look just like him! ﻿Beber? ﻿Beberiko, I'm sorry I didn't make it to the funeral. ﻿Here, we've brought him to you. ﻿Here, have a little of my grandpa. ﻿Wow... ﻿Come in, come in, ﻿have something to eat, drink, wash off the dust. ﻿C'mon, Morad. ﻿Morad. ﻿Sorry. ﻿I feel like death warmed over. ﻿The times we had sex on this table... ﻿Sex? ﻿With my Grandpa Beber? ﻿Here, on this table? ﻿Why only on the table? ﻿He changed the shocks on his Volkswagen twice a month. ﻿Oh, the Volkswagen. ﻿He left it to Yaki. -I'm sure he did. ﻿It's worth a million shekels. ﻿First off the assembly line. ﻿He always said you'd get it. ﻿You ruined Yaki's life! -It's your fault, too! ﻿You're ruining Yaki's life! ﻿Are you crazy? -You're crazy! ﻿How should I know it's worth a million? -You should! ﻿A million shekels went to Lawrence the Spiderman! -Shut up! ﻿Shut up! -Shut up! -Shut up! ﻿Not another word! ﻿He screwed us with the Volvo and sent us to die in the desert! ﻿You ruined Yaki's life! ﻿Enough! ﻿Stop arguing! ﻿It's over!

Uzi... ﻿Listen, Uzi, I'm in bad shape. ﻿Just give us the cash and we'll go. ﻿Give him the ball. ﻿Uzi. ﻿Morad, don't. ﻿Can I talk to you a sec? ﻿Relax, man. ﻿You're a fighter. Don't be scared. You've been through much worse. ﻿Relax, I'll aim at your forehead. ﻿Make sure you hit my forehead. -For sure, man. ﻿Don't you dare... -Don't worry. ﻿Morad... ﻿Your forehead. Don't worry. ﻿I'll knock his face off. ﻿Morad! ﻿Relax. ﻿Morad, I've always respected you. ﻿Check this out. ﻿Got it. ﻿Tsufi. -What? -What's in your eye? ﻿Morad, don't you dare laugh. ﻿Why did you spit on him? ﻿Because someone spiked my pot noodles! ﻿I don't know who, a leopard, a jackal, a deer, ﻿Racheli... ﻿I'm downing a shot the minute we get to the hotel. ﻿Chill, Tsufi. ﻿Fuck you... ﻿Okay, I'll just smell it. ﻿Miss him? ﻿Remember, I have the Taser. ﻿Remember, we're arresting him. ﻿It really bothers you, doesn't it? ﻿Excellent corn. ﻿Come on.. ﻿Come on! ﻿What a crappy player! ﻿What's the schedule? ﻿Kleers explains the rules and then we start. ﻿Who are you texting? ﻿Racheli. She's a few doors down. ﻿Ask her out for a meal, stupid. ﻿He's a caveman, he doesn't think of those things. ﻿He doesn't think, period. ﻿No, she says she's taking a shower... ﻿That's a hint, stupid. ﻿Is it? ﻿Yes! ﻿Get going! ﻿Benson, look at Morad. ﻿Show no mercy. ﻿Go for it. ﻿Leave me alone, Oren, I covered my debt. ﻿Why'd you leave them in Ein Gedi? ﻿Because Benson started asking questions ﻿and they slipped me ecstasy, the bastards. ﻿Ecstasy? ﻿Yes, ecstasy. ﻿Did they give you trouble? “^-Sure did? — ﻿They're in, that's all that matters. ﻿All four. ﻿You look like shit. ﻿Racheli just said... ﻿Look who just came in, ﻿Aya and Kleers. ﻿You're mine until the game is over. ﻿Because I said so, that's why. ﻿What is this dump? ﻿No, no... ﻿Shut up and listen. ﻿What's up, Morad? ﻿Still stoned? ﻿I'll get right to the point, ﻿I said enough yesterday. ﻿I'm here because of you. ﻿Kleers?! You're too good for him, Aya. ﻿But not for you? ﻿With your gangster act ﻿and your infantile personality? ﻿Yes, but I'm a charismatic infant. ﻿We're gonna grow old together. ﻿Silly boy. ﻿I missed you, Nimni. ﻿Don't join the game. ﻿Don't try to beat him. ﻿All right, ﻿friends, ﻿dear friends... ﻿One game, ﻿Texas Hold'em, ﻿four on four, ﻿the last two players from each team... -Hello, hello. ﻿Hello, Racheli. ﻿How's it going? ﻿Keep walking. ﻿Go screw someone else. ﻿Along with the bets... -Excuse me? ﻿Buzz off. -We hope to reach a million. ﻿Folks, I'm playing with these three clowns... ﻿What's the matter, man? ﻿It's all over. -We're playing against ﻿tonight's four stars... -It'll be okay, Benson. ﻿ladies and gentlemen, ﻿the Garbage Pail Kids. ﻿What a pile of garbage! ﻿What happened to your face? ﻿A drug dealer threw a basketball at it. ﻿No, seriously. Did you start drinking again? -What? How did... ﻿Oh, police. ﻿No, I'm not drinking again. -Good. ﻿Don't. ﻿Grab your buddies and go home, ﻿otherwise I'll have to... -Rape you. ﻿Gilden, put a cork in it! ﻿Sorry, they're... bugging me. ﻿Is it possible that we had sex? ﻿Don't avoid the subject, and BTW, absolutely not. ﻿If you're there I'll have to arrest you. ﻿I'm pretty sure we had sex and it was amazing. ﻿Naturally. But didn't have sex. ﻿Concentrate. You could end up in jail. ﻿Or in Hili. ﻿Gilden! ﻿Tsuf... ﻿Tsuf... ﻿You'll get two years at least. ﻿If you're there when there's money on the table... ﻿it's all over. ﻿We definitely had sex. ﻿Trippin'! ﻿You're really trippin'. ﻿No? ﻿You can go now. ﻿Before we prepare for the game ﻿I have a little gift for you. ﻿After all, we're friends, right? ﻿If you please. ﻿And now, a live broadcast... ﻿What is this crap? -Kleers is such an idiot. ﻿The pupils of Hebrew High School in Jerusalem ﻿singing "Brotherhood" for Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. ﻿Look at us back then. ﻿Spaghetti! ﻿A total idiot, I'm telling you. ﻿Yaki, Yaki, Yaki... ﻿What's the matter? ﻿Go fuck yourself. -What's the matter? ﻿It's a joke. Morad! ﻿I'm glad that happened, ﻿now we'll work out our anger at the table. ﻿Count me out. ﻿I can't handle this crap. ﻿I'm going to scatter the ashes. ﻿So he can rest in peace. ﻿No more of this nostalgia shit. ﻿I understand, Yaki, ﻿but he humiliated us again. ﻿Are we gonna let him? ﻿I don't care any more! ﻿Yako, your grandpa gave you a big hug, ﻿with all the garbage, the humiliation... Whether you play or not, ﻿he hugged you, man. ﻿Where are you going? ﻿I'll do ten laps in the pool ﻿as long as I'm here. ﻿Are you OK? ﻿Just smelling, Benson. ﻿Just smelling. ﻿Yaki Reuveni, ladies and gentlemen. ﻿The autumn night falls on the Negev ﻿Kindling stars silently ﻿When the wind blows through the doorway ﻿Clouds walk along the road ﻿For a year we've hardly noticed how time has passed in our fields ﻿For a year only a few of us remain when once we were many ﻿But we'll remember them all ﻿The handsome young men ﻿For brotherhood like this will never let our hearts forget... ﻿The Fist. ﻿Wanna go play? ﻿And finally wipe the garbage off our faces? ﻿When do we move in? I have men with families here. ﻿Weren't you at the briefing? ﻿We move in at the end, ﻿so keep your pants on. ﻿It's genetics. -Or the batteries. ﻿Chief! ﻿Officer Rosen, ﻿Officer Gilden. ﻿Ready? -Ready. ﻿Money goes out, we go in. ﻿Brilliant idea. ﻿Hili, ﻿what are you listening to? ﻿Chief, she's way out of line. -Clam it! ﻿My source is shy. We'll wait for the arrest. ﻿If Kleers gets away again ﻿I'm blaming you. ﻿Squaw. ﻿Aya says your dick is teensy. ﻿Is that so? ﻿Big enough for your mama. ﻿My mama died this year, stupid. ﻿So that's why she didn't move. ﻿Can I talk to you a sec? ﻿Buzz off. ﻿If you see a green deck, ask to switch. ﻿I said buzz off. ﻿Start playing, already. ﻿What the fuck? -What's going on? ﻿Did you and the Chief plan this? ﻿No. -Gilden! -No! ﻿They were just here. ﻿Those bitches have style, huh? -What's going on? ﻿Where'd they go? -Chief... ﻿This may sound strange, but... ﻿Get to the roof and scour the joint. ﻿Move it! ﻿One more wink and I break your legs. ﻿You have two minutes before Kleers disappears. ﻿Screw up, you're out. ﻿Where are they?! ﻿Careful, you'll poke my eye out! ﻿My apologies... ﻿I'm always cautious when there's money on the table. ﻿You never know who's watching. ﻿What's the story? We have ashes to scatter. ﻿Wanna hear the sea? ﻿Hello? ﻿Morad. ﻿All in. ﻿Just you and me and Lady Luck. ﻿Who deals? ﻿You've met, haven't you? ﻿Racheli thought she was through for the day ﻿but I persuaded her to stay. ﻿Shame on you, Racheli. ﻿One hand, all in. ﻿Anyone want to switch decks? ﻿Deal, for fuck's sake! ﻿Why are you just sitting there? ﻿What about your wiretap? ﻿The rape victim? -Tsufi! ﻿Kirschheimer? ﻿I hear them. -Speaker! ﻿Washing machine! -Dryer! ﻿All in. ﻿Show your cards if you want. ﻿Do you? -No. ﻿Last card. ﻿Hearthat? ﻿Washing machine! -Dryer! ﻿Dryer... ﻿You loser. -Can you hear the sea, Kleers? ﻿If you're a poker player, I'm an African. ﻿You are an African. ﻿How can that be? ﻿I can't believe it! ﻿What are the chances? ﻿Makes no sense... ﻿He tricked you, Morad. ﻿It's a trick deck. ﻿I'll kick his ass... ﻿I knew it! ﻿Son of a bitch! ﻿You're dead meat! ﻿Stinking crooks! Move! ﻿Aya? ﻿You mean you're a... -Cop? ﻿Idiot! Are you crazy?! -Shut up! ﻿You shut up! -Idiot! -Moron! ﻿Take your stuff and wait outside. You're free to go. ﻿What? -Hili... ﻿Are you serious, ma'am? ﻿I said wait outside. ﻿Tsufi... ﻿stay here. ﻿I'll stay with Tsufi, ﻿he's a little unstable. ﻿Tsuf Kirschheimer. ﻿What's all the mystery about? ﻿I tapped your phone... ﻿three days ago. ﻿What? -What? ﻿Is that legal? -No, ﻿but if you don't want to go to jail with your pals, ﻿Tsufi, ﻿you'll tell everyone you were working with us from the start, ﻿that you helped us take Oren down. ﻿Do I have a choice? ﻿It's that or jail. ﻿I'll take jail. ﻿Kidding. ﻿Cute. ﻿I won't do it. ﻿I have a condition. ﻿Release Racheli. ﻿I'm not kidding. Let Racheli go. ﻿I don't mind a year in jail with my buddies. ﻿You'll let Racheli go because... ﻿Really? ﻿Sign here. ﻿Want my number? ﻿have it. ﻿Gilden, beat it. -What? -Out. ﻿Get lost. ﻿Kiss my ass. ﻿Where is she, shithead? ﻿You're free... ﻿and I apologize. ﻿You'll want to catch your flight. ﻿There is no flight. ﻿Shithead here lost all the money. ﻿I'm looking for a bartender if you're interested. ﻿You'll cover your trip in three years. ﻿For sure. ﻿Give it to him. ﻿Loser. ﻿Can you believe Aya's a cop? ﻿Suits you. ﻿Thanks, bro. ﻿For what? ﻿Insisting that I come. ﻿It did me good. ﻿You can go, cop with a beard. ﻿I spit on people like you. ﻿Yaki. -Aya Shickler. My oh my. ﻿I thought about you all week. ﻿Sorry to hear the news. -Thanks. ﻿I cried, can you believe it? ﻿Be right there. ﻿Hili Rosen. ﻿You took good care of your source. ﻿Well done. ﻿You could've said something... I wouldn't have had to worry so much. ﻿You'd appreciate me less. ﻿Nice job, Hili. ﻿Gilden helped. ﻿Chief, Hili raped a suspect. ﻿Virgin. ﻿Well? ﻿You're a cop, huh? ﻿Does it matter? ﻿Not really, but... ﻿Can I ask you a question? ﻿Do you get discounts? ﻿More than you'd believe. -Is that so? ﻿Will you wear your uniform next time we meet? ﻿If you stop breaking the law. ﻿This is just wrong. ﻿Someone has to tell him those aren't his grandpa's ashes. ﻿Shut up, Tsufi. Not a word. ﻿Besides, what does it matter? ﻿Look how sad he is. ﻿Who cares whose grandpa he is? ﻿Ashes are ashes. ﻿Yaki! -Shut your trap! -Shut up, idiot! ﻿What's going on? ﻿I'll kick your ass, moron! -Leave him alone! ﻿It's always been this way. ﻿They're children. ﻿Do you realize how much money slipped through our hands? ﻿It's money, Morad, it comes and goes ﻿like the wind. ﻿What a trip. ﻿And don't forget the Volkswagen. ﻿Stop! ﻿Are you thinking what I'm thinking? ﻿The Volkswagen, you fools! ﻿Okay, what's the plan? ﻿We need some military tactics. ﻿I forgot everything the minute I was discharged. ﻿Aya? ﻿What does he care about the most? ﻿The horse. ﻿So... someone release the horse and someone steal the car, or someone do both. -Right. ﻿I'll do it. -No, Aya! Me too. -No, Racheli! What're you doing? Morad, it's dangerous! I have a spare key! We're done for. -Fuck, fuck, fuck... What's she doing? -Benson, the keys! He'll kill us, He knows we're here. No, that was just a stray bullet. Uh-oh, This is turning into Custer's Last Stand Take Beber. -The urn is empty. Here they come! Our darlings. -Aya, let me drive. Run!
