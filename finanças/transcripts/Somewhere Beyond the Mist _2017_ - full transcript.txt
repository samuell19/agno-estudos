Dr Ho! You're here! You need to come home. Your home is here. You cannot go anywhere. You follow me home. Come, I'll bring you home. We need to go home. Your house is here. "Top Doctor with a tender heart" Honey, I write down your police office's number. No, I don't want people to ask about my dad. Dad, put it on. Keep it OK? Leave it If you get lost, show it to someone. - What's up? - You look upset. No. Don't get mad at your dad. It's bad for the baby. You're too sensitive. It's only three months pregnant. Baby tell your mum to stay calm. You know what? What? The baby says that you're silly. - He says, I'm handsome! - No way. You're silly. Get up. It's 7:45. Late. It's your standing punishment! Stand here! You never bring aprons to cookery class. It's your last warning. Bring your aprons, or go to Disciplinary Office. - Angela, your call. - Thanks. Inspector Lai. We found two middle-aged bodies. The male is Stephen. The female is Ling. They don't seem to be drowned. Bruises were found on the necks. We suspect that it wasn't an accident. Their son confirms their identity. We're looking for their daughter, Connie. Connie. Yes. So? Let's find the janitor. Yep. Let's go. Pretty? They've been here for a few days. Hi, we're police. Are you Connie? Yes. Is he your boyfriend? No, we're classmates. Do you know your parent's death? Yes. Would you come over and help us? OK. No, we aren't arresting. Thanks. Connie, please. Can you drop me off somewhere nearby? Then I meet you up. All right. Angela, I take her. OK. Connie. Jessica. Take care. We found your parent's bodies near the dam. I know. Do you have the photos of the bodies? May I see? Yes but it looks bad. You have heart disease, don't you? Septal defect. It's incurable. I have artificial valves inside three big scars outside and metal wires in my chest. But I can see. Here they are. I see. They are my parents. Are you OK? Why not? What do you mean? I killed my parents. Watch your words. I did it. Eh she's underage. Call a social worker next to her. - She still has family. - Who's left? - Her older brother. - Well, do you mean her sexfriend? No, her real brother. Real brother? Hey, what's his name? Hey. - Hey. - His name is Frederick. - Done? - Just a second. It's done. What's he? A crook? Hey! I heard about your parent's mishap. Do they find the killer? No. The police is still searching. - Don't be upset. - I'm fine. Don't be sad. No. I'll buy a necklace every day for you so you can have more commission. Thanks. My hotel is near here, convenient for me to see you. Come to see my room? - Hello. Thanks for coming, Frederick. Welcome. Find a lawyer? No. Let's start. Did you plan to kill your brother? No. Tell me about your childhood. My brother took me to Ocean Park. I don't remember. But I'll go along with Connie. This is the closet. My parents said Eric hid himself inside. I know that Eric slept over here. Have you seen him? No. It's just a feeling. In the past I was close to my sister. This earring was a gift from Connie. She bought it to make fun on me. But I put it on to show her. She laughed. Why didn't you notice the bodies hidden here? I hit the sack when I get home. We've barely seen each other. Even we've hardly had meals together. Why did Connie kill? No clue. My parents died. My sister was arrested. Case closed. How much? It's my treat. I help you. "Social Worker Room" Hi, Jessica. I'm Angela. I don't want to talk. Don't put up with bullying. People are evil. Fight back! I don't fight. I smile. Take revenge after smiling. Got it? Roll down your pants. It's beautiful. Promise me to dress like this. No matter what happened, Connie is always my friend. Didn't She kill? Killing has nothing to do with friendship. Look at your panties. What are long panties! With big tits! Stupid pig! Yeah! - She is so smelly! - Check it out. - Don't move! - She smells like curry! Don't wear your curry perfume! Ok now. I talk to them. Let me help. - I'll fight with them. - Here they come. Let's hide. Catch you sneaking around. Record them. You banged her! How fun! You played with sex toys! Stop it! Was he a pimp? He was a driver. He delivered vegetables. Those were his hobbies. You cover him. Excuse me? He was killed by me. Damn! No taste. Hi, it's me. Morning. Hey, you can't treat me like this. I'm just badly in love with you. I'm not fucking nuts. Take the bowl back. Beware of the roaches. Don't fucking block me! What the hell are you finding? Fuck off! Chill out. Why so itchy? The scars? Those wires inside the chest! Cumming. You dad likes porns. I warn you. Don't tell anyone. OK. Did he ask you watching together? He's so perverted. You're so pretty. Did he ever touch you? If he dares I kill him. Open the door! - New! Who is hiding there? Open it! You bastard! Get out! Come! You chicken! Fuck you! How dare you touch my daughter. Get out! I'm gonna kill you! Fuck you! How dare you! I cut off your dick. Fuck you! Listen up! If you want to get laid I get you a client. A virgin pussy costs more money! I'm so handsome. - Silly. - I'm serious. Look around clearly. Although it's remote it's better than any luxury mansions. Hang on. Let's go. Always, we can hear bird singing. I'm so romantic, right? My home is the best love hotel. Watch out. Welcome to my palace! Come on in. Hey, you are so early. Yes. This is your pa's friend. - What's your name? - Hi, monitress. You are classmates? Monitress is smart. Go back to your room. Eat with me. Are you nuts? You're grown-up. Don't come over. I have my friend here. Help me. That side. Sit down. Let's enjoy. You had dinner with his wife at home. It's ashamed. I was paid for that. Really? Men are weird. It's his fetish. It's OK to me. How about his wife? She never spoke. I wonder if his wife was dumb. But he said that she just didn't like to speak. Good shot! Here you go. Good. Be seated. Thanks. Welcome, Mr Leung. Just call me Stephen. Hi, Stephen. You're her social worker? Yes, my name is Shing. Nice to meet you, Shing. Well, sorry about my daughter. It happens. She used to be a nice girl. But I was busy at my office in China. In China? Yes, just like most of the Hongkongers. You still work there? I'm back to Hong Kong now. I see. As a father, I support the school. I strongly agree no dating at school. You see. My daughter is pretty so I'll work with the school to prevent this from happening. Yes, Connie and Eric are close. That brat is horny and filthy. Keep him away. We'll keep an eye on both Connie and Eric. Yes. But we have another issue. Oh, yes. Actually, it's already settled. Connie stole from her classmates. What's that? Nothing valuable, so it's settled. What did she steal? Pens, exercise books, and hair ties etc. - Hair ties? The black ones? - Yes. Everyone has one. - He set you up. - No. The hair tie has a smiley face. What the hell are you talking about? Damn fatty, how dare you! We have evidences. What the fuck! Don't bullshit! Her pocket money is even more than your salary! I'll call the police! I didn't beat anyone! How dare you accuse her! You're a beast. It's bad to your daughter. Do you mean I'm a bad father? Damn you! Fatty! Motherfucker! Don't be nuts. I'm sticking up for you. With What? I'm gonna kill you! Let's see. I'll kill you! Shut up! - Honey. - Huh? I take a walk to there. OK. Be careful. Dad, stay here. You don't eat chicken. You won't eat it. Eat the vegetable. Want some? - Joyce. - Yes. Come help me. Dr Ho, come with me. You need to clean up. Dad, it's fine. Let me do it. Come with me. - Dad. - Dr Ho. Sit down. Stop. You eat. Stop. Stand up. Watch out. - Honey. - Huh? Do you come? No, I don't. Dad will spend the rest of his time in this elderly home. He deserves a single room. It is already a very nice place. When mum died, it was worse. We can afford a single room. It's not a matter of money. We go now. Calm down. Calm down. Dad. Dad. Dad. Calm down. Eric I want to kill my parents by myself. Can you help? Let's commit suicide. They should die, not us. You're such a gay coward! Go home. Be your mama's boy! Go back to your mama. You can't even kill! That's why everyone calls you faggot. You're actually worse. Now you tease me. You can't kill. You've got no balls. Go, faggot. Eric. Do you help me? I'm through with you. My son didn't do it. He is a descent boy. I'm a taxpayer. I won't let him go wrong. You're just a guardian to accompany him. I can speak for him. Son, come home with me! Shut up! I don't want to see my mum. I prefer a social worker. What? You're my baby boy. I'm a grown-up, not a baby. I will go to prison. I won't see you anymore! Connie. I want her to be my girl. Then I won't be a gay. His father brutally beating is not a big deal to me. He found me in his daughter's room, so he beat me. It's understandable. There are people, with no reason sticking a broomstick to my ass. They say I'm a sissy, not a real man. Did Connie fight back for you? No, she's bullied too. Be my friend? I first killed my dad. Then my mum. I work very hard and I'm hard. Wait. I call you later. Open the door! You wear too little. I'll exercise. Execrise or get laid? Hey, your heart is too weak for that. Put on more clothes. Don't catch cold. How long was it between two murders? Three hours. Mum is a part-time psychic, but she's a fake. Connie, help! Now you speak. Why your mum first? She's lighter. How about your dad's body? No hurry, so let it be. But it became stinky. Do you mean from the corpse? After a week, the weather got hot the smell got disgusting and weird so we dumped it. Why is there blood? The closet's floor was still warm. Finally, I'm a man. So? What? Hi, Jessica well, it's time to pee. She has school tomorrow. Hi, Jessica well, it's time to poo. So? So? So? Tell me. Tell me. Don't stare at me! Tell me. No idea. No idea? You ruined me! Open the mouth. "Tube-feeding" I'll give birth soon. For a while I can't come to see you. I wish I could leave you. It's unfair. Mum should've been happier. I almost forget her face. I only remember she cried in front of the washing-machine. Few months ago I came across a parenticide girl. After that, I always had nightmares that I killed you too. I'm not scared of the killing but being jailed. Why did you go to the mountain? For a vacation. For the life that I deserve. That's it? Yes.
