WOMEN WITH DICK, MEN WITH VAGINA. RECIFE - BOA VIAGEM BEACH NORTHEAST OF BRAZIL We'll see on the way. What's the best beach to stay. There's a right time to drink. A beer before lunch is good to think better. I walk where I want. You're twisting better girl. On the beach where the sea touches the dance just started. And she is... Hi I'm Alice Junior. Hey folks, I'm Alice Junior. Hey folks, I'm Alice Junior. The incomparable girl! For those of you who don't know me yet, I ask: Where on earth have you been? Ring any bells? No. I'll refresh your memory. I was one of the finalists of the last “Next Teen Top Model”. How cool! I didn't get to win the prize but it was cool to be in the finals. Look at her! Finally! As promised, I'll be here with you every Tuesday on this channel. MARVELOUS POWERFUL DIVINE Alice Junior Answering these troubling doubts. May it rain letters. Just go there and ask your question. This question was sent by @Gustrava. Trava, trava, trava, trava! “Alice, on your show you revealed you've never been kissed.” “Now that you're famous, is it raining boys in your inbox?” T-lovers are everywhere. They're pouring down. It's just hard avoiding them. Mrs... Mrs… As for the kiss, there's a cute new boy at school who asked me out to see the new Star Wars. Who knows, right? Pierre, I've been wanting you for a while. You attract me, I'm all yours. Next question: “Alice, I'm 14 and I realized I was a trans person” when I saw you in the Next Teen Top Model.” “Thanks for inspiring me. I chose to call myself Marcela. What do you think?” - It's beautiful Marcela, when I… - Alice! Dad, I'm recording. I need to talk to you. Ok, go ahead, I'll edit later. Ok. Can I sit here? Do you remember I told you about an exotic fruit they found down South? You know I'm a bit absent when you talk about work. You attract me, I'm all yours. - Are you recording? - I'll edit later. Anyway, Oxygen was thinking of me to study it for its new winter's perfume. - And you got the job? - Yes. Congrats, dad! Now I can get a new computer. Make a little heart to the camera for the video. The problem is that Oxygen expects that the fragrance be revealed in its natural habitat. Natural habitat. Hum... hmmm. Be specific. What do you want me to do? That you pack your bags. We're moving. Heeeeeeeeeelp!!! This place doesn't even have 50 thousand people. Good. What I really need is peace to work. I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to Rhinoceros. Excuse me. Not even 50 thousand people, Rhinoceros. It's like an illuminated village. And the forecast for this week… Is a maximum of… 59°F! Huh? No friends, no career, no kissing, no Pierre, and to make it worse, no phone signal. It's just a small change for a few months. It won't hurt you a bit. ARAUCARIAS DO SUL - SOUTH OF BRAZIL - A small change?! I call this a kidnapping! Did you have any difficulties to reach paradise? We got a bit lost. That happens… soon you'll get used to the town. Araucarias do Sul is small, but it's first rate. Put in second gear, and you're out of here. Pleasure to meet you Mr. Jean. When Oxygen contacted the agency, we knew we'd be dealing with sophisticated clients. I did everything to personally come here to welcome you. - Give me Rhinoceros. - And this boy is your son? No, it's a girl. Sorry, it's really a boy. These days they love to be androgynous. Shall we visit the house? This house gets the sunlight on both sides. The old owners did this to get as much sunlight as possible. They were as we say… sustainability. The couple that lived here before were very successful in cinema. But they had to leave town… they were gays. Not that I'm against it. I'm a straight dammit. - You said there was a basement. - Yes. This way please. URGH This is where they would make their movies. It's perfect. Here are your keys, and my card with my phone number. If you need anything, just call me. I hope your stay in Araucarias do Sul will be fruitful. You'll see, this house will do lots of good to your son. My daughter! It's very calm, well isolated. I don't intend to isolate her, thank you. Get out of the dumps. Travesti don't give up girl. Don't force me bitch. You have no idea of the situation I'm in. Stop it. You're whining on a full stomach. That's because you're not the one dragged out here - in the asshole of the world by your dad. - I see you got the devil in you girl. And when you're like that, you know, girl, Sashay Away. Kisses! I love you. My crush… THIS IS TO REMIND YOU HOW AMAZING DAD JEAN IS! Alice. - I have a surprise for you. - What is it? This. I've spoken to your endocrinologist. You can start the treatment. Come here, dad. - Sorry, daddy. - Speaking to me again? I miss you. Today was the day Pierre was taking me to the movies. It should be the day of my first kiss. Dad, I'm serious. Here we go. You're marvelous, my girl. You'll soon be surrounded by new friends. About that, what's the school like here? Oh, hum, hum… Jean Genet, don't pretend you didn't hear me. It's a catholic school, No, dad. Seriously? - Of The Sacred Heart... - You're joking? - Of Our Lady... - No! - Of Redemption. - Dad! - It's the best there is, my dear. - Hory shet! Alice! Swearing at the table, no! And it's “holy shit”. Tomorrow's the day of fighting lions, I must be ready! Alice. I'm not calling you again. The car's on wasting gas. Relax, damn it! This is a story of a girl who liked to dance. Everyone was amazed at her way of breaking. Algerian, wee, northeastern, mind-blowing. Snazzy makeup, brightness of cut. Look at this girl, honey. You're beautiful, my dear. A pearl. Thank you. But, are you sure? Since I'm going to catch their attention anyway at least like this I'll have some fun. Oh... I was almost forgetting. Excuse me, baby. Hmm... THE SACRED HEART OF OUR LADY OF REDEMPTION SCHOOL Fuck! Alice... go easy. I've arrived. I've arrived putting the house down. Ready to whip my hair. Screw it. It can blow up for all I care. 'Cause nobody is ruining my day. Warn them, tell them. That I've arrived. I've arrived putting the house down. Ready to whip my hair. Screw it. It can blow up for all I care. ' Cause nobody is ruining my day. Warn them, tell them. That I've arrived like a sickening hurricane. I've arrived fierce as fuck. Look at me, turn the lights off and turn up the sound. The jealous bitches freak out. Crusty cunts conspire. To make others envious, I am good. What's your name? Alice Junior. I don't know what place you came out of, but here in Araucarias do Sul, students don't come to school dressed like clowns. Agenor, go to the stockroom and get a male uniform for this boy. Boy?! What did you expect... Jean Genet Junior? Here. Next class folks, the African Diaspora. Excuse me, teacher. Faggots go to the back. Who hasn't read about the subject yet, read page 32. Read! Not search on the Internet. Oh... Again, Guilherme... Get out! - But teacher, it was he... - I said out! Straight to the principal's office. Tell her I'm the one who sent you as a gift. And you... can sit down. Don't forget, the essay have to be based on the Calango video. 15 lines minimum to hand in next class, folks. Bruna, Manoela, 15 lines. Don't come with 13 or 12 lines. History teachers know how to count. Lino, 15 lines. See you tomorrow. You. What's with me? What's your name? Alice Junior. Are you crazy, girl? Get out of here Viviane. Get out, you... Yuck... - What the fuck? - Hi. Sorry, I'm testing my new device. It's a direct register that subjectively distills the patriarchal reek in this juvenile academic center. What? Never mind. My name's Viviane. You're Alice, right? - You know me from the reality show? - What reality show? No. It's just that you're the trendy topic at school. Don't worry. I'm here to fight against any type of oppression. I'm also in your class. But I sit in the front desk. Oh… ok. You're... transsexual, right? We still say transsexual? It can be. But I prefer Alice. You can call me Alice. Against labels, this young transsexual prefers - to be called… - Hey, what's this for? This is for my snap news. I'm the… school's young reporter. Can I? Great snack. Where did you get it? I brought it from home so that I don't eat that shit food from school. Hey you, young Araucarian. I, Viviane Amorim, am launching the new campaign: #AvoidTheCanteenSnacks. My new friend, Alice Junior, and I will be giving some tips on healthy nutrition so that you won't be left out or anything. So, Alice, tell us a bit more about your… Fierce fag. We're in the same class, right? I'll tell you only once and I hope that it's clear. We have nothing in common. I'm not like you, you're not like me, so we'll never be friends. It hasn't been easy to go unnoticed all these years in this macho school without calling the attention of the Alfa machos. To be friends with the travesti (him) of the school is far beyond my survival plans. I'm “THE” travesti (her) of the school. What a crusty cunt! No touching! No touching! No touching! No touching! IMPERIAL PINECONE Give me a Cachaça Horn. Ok, Zé. - Thanks, Fi. - Thanks, Zé. You're mine now. It's 3 for 10, sir. Give me a dozen of these Imperial pinecones, please. Fucking damn it! Is this yours? I'm sorry. I thought I had attached the ladder well. - It just came out of the inspection. - Don't worry. I'll cover the costs. - That's the minimum, no? - Well, well… So much negative energy needing to come out. What kind of a joke is this? Ok. We can talk now. Here, put down your number. Well, well, well… what do we have here? Aunt Rosa told me to keep an eye on you, Alice Junior. Your aunt's the bitchy principal? Wow! What strong genetics. Sininho doesn't like it either when BOYS poke around the GIRLS' bathroom. I just wanna see when you can't hide from her anymore you're a dyke, and need her help. Rhinoceros, please tell me you had a normal day. Meow. So I say. Don't you want me to buy you a female uniform? And use that really ugly military skirt? No fucking way. It's for a short time, you know. Whatever, dad. I just want to have a normal day tomorrow. - Antonia Meireles. - Present. - Alicia Camargo. - Present. - Bruna Miguel. - Present. - Beatriz Ramos. - I. HOW WAS THE STAR WARS MOVIE? - Eduardo Souza. - I. Smartphones off and in the bag. - Julia Menezes. - Present. Jean Genet Junior. Present. But correct it, teacher. It's Alice Junior. Jean Genet Junior. Jean Genet Junior. Jean Genet Junior. Alice Junior. Present. HOW WAS THE STAR WARS MOVIE? Saw it but didn't answer it, damn it! Hey hunty! How are you, my dear? Look at me! I put 150 ml in each side. I know that face. What happened? This is what happened and what's happening girl. I mean, finally a teacher called me by my social name. - Anyways, these boys are all idiots. - Humm, I understand. But I'm sure it's not because of this gag that you're telling me this. Come on, speak up! What is it? The boys from Recife are also idiots. Alice, advice: Forget these far away boys, my love. Concentrate on what's happening around you. Think of this person who called you by your social name. If you concentrate on what's happening around you, you'll meet a great person. You'll meet an incredible person. Go on and free yourself. You know, you're right. Oh, fucking shit! Thanks for the tip, friend. Got to go. I'll explain later. Bye, love you. Hey! Need help? I was just avoiding that web pain-in-the-ass. Viviane? Who doesn't? God, is that a real tattoo? No. It just pen. Wanna see something? Holy shit! Your parents let you? Fuck my parents! Can I? Cool. I can't wait to tattoo Rhinoceros. Rhinoceros? My cat. I could tattoo your back. That would be cool. Girl are you crazy? I got to get a really small one so my dad doesn't see it. - Oh, shit. - What's wrong? I got to do my tucking. - What? - Hide my prick. Cover me. Check that no one's coming. Done. Thanks. Hey! I don't know your name. - Alice. And yours? - Taisa. Bye, Taisa. Beware, those I catch photographing the board. Grab a pencil and write: - Calloused hand... - Subject known by heart. Shitty pinecone. What is your secret? My dear, smell it. What do you think? Dad, you want a cute answer or a sincere one? The cute one… It smells like when Rhinoceros took a shit after eating mothballs. Expecting anyone? It must be Viviane. So we have a friend? You want a cute answer or a sincere one? She's more like a fan stalker. Like the one in horror movies. Reeeeeeecording. Sound. Sound. Sound. Here we are starting the second interview for the series Great Araucarian Personalities. - Here we are with Alice Junior. - Who was your first interviewee? Me. All right. Let's start. Tell me. How did you choose the name Alice? - I was… - Wait. Speak here. I was 10 and mommy would read Alice in Wonderland to me every night. I'm a super fan of Alice. I swear. And how was it at that time? Tell me. I was really free. I had lots of imagination. I would wear mommy's clothes and go looking for Mr. Rabbit in the yard. I knew who I was. I just didn't know the word trans existed or that there was an entire society that would imprison you. - Yes, I understand. - Now, I ask you a question. - Have you ever kissed on the mouth? - What!? Viviane Amorim, have you ever kissed on the mouth? What a childish question. Why? You look like someone who has a VM (Virgin Mouth). - You look like someone who has a VM too. - I have a VM. I'm a trans VM. That's one more title to put on my account. Well, I've never kissed either. - Are you a lesbian? - Lesbian? No! Yes... - Yes or no? - And no. Politically, yes. Everywhere I look, I see male privileges. I like boys. It's just… I don't know. Just knowing them better gives me ten kinds of laziness. That's our answer. Ok. Continuing the interview. You were talking about you mom, or as you said: Mommy. I want to know what your relationship's like? I'm dying to meet her. Vivi, my mom died when I was 11. Oh my, Alice. I'm so sorry. I really didn't know. - I'm sorry to make you go through this. - Vivi, it's all right. I'm the worst reporter in the world. Stop it. It's all right. Seriously. You're the best reporter that's ever interviewed me on a pedalo. Seriously, I'm ready to continue. Really? Really. There's just one condition. - Huh? - You ask a question, and I ask another. Deal. What do you want to know? You said some of the boys in school were good-looking. I want names. - Oh no, Alice. - Come on, come on. What for? What's it going to change? - Lino isn't? - Lino? Lino's out of the question. Matheus. - Matheus? - Matheus. - Seriously? - Paulo. - Paulo's cute. - Paulo came and spoke to me. - Paulo spoke to you? - He came to speak with me. Where? I didn't call him. He came up to speak with me. - Where? - At school. - Seriously? - Humm. Ok. I dropped my book and he came to talk to me. What? I saw it in a movie. You saw it in a movie? What did he tell you? “You let the book fall. Pick it up” See. What a man. He was worried about my studies. "Do you want any help to pick up your dignity that's on the ground with the book?" Discover the secret for Oxygen. Good morning, daddy. You spent the whole night working? What time is it? It's already 7:10. Look! Even the sun came out. Good. Perfect. I'll put my baby Araucaria to maturate. Daddy, I'm late and have exams today. Focus. All right, all right. What a pain... I don't know... My heart... Will know... Of the illusion... I'm going to the sea... To seek... - A stone necklace... - Hi Alice. Hi... to beautify you... This is Bruno, my boyfriend. Plea… Pleasure, he's all mine. I mean… I mean, no... Pleasure. So, how did I come out in the picture? - I didn't know you knew each other. - No, I just ruined her selfie. To class I will… you… To class I will go, and… Bye. Bye. That thing you said is really true. - What thing? - She really looks like a girl. Your test is here! Mr. Guilherme. Alice. - Alice. - What is it? - What's wrong with you? - I'm dying to pee. Ask to go to the bathroom. What bathroom? There are no bathrooms here for me, Viviane. Teacher, may I go to the bathroom? No chances, Alice. You just came back from the break. Go later. Hey! Look! The faggot pissed herself completely. Pisser. Pisser. It's a waterfall. FAG PISSES HIMSELF IN CLASSROOM Pisser. Pisser. My dear, what happened? All that was missing, dad. Now I'm the Sissy Pisser of the school. - I'm very sorry for your son. - Daughter! What you and your son do or don't in your home doesn't interest us. Look, even here at the school we have two or three delicate boys like your son. That's one thing Alice isn't, delicate. What I want to say is that the difference of values cannot prevail over the school rules. Just because of that, I'd like to deal with this through the law, and not your values. - Meet my lawyer, Mara Rocha. - Is this a joke? Alice is not allowed to use the girls' bathroom in her new school. Lord! How square! Really? And the principal here isn't very up-dated. - Hello, my dear. Ready? Let's go. - What's this? Alice. It's to the teachers' bathroom. If any of them complains, tell them to talk to me. Thanks. But I don't intend to come back here ever. Access to locker rooms, bathrooms and any other gender segregated places must be guaranteed according to the person's gender identity. In Alice's case, the gender FE-MA-LE. Way to go, Mara. Thanks a lot. I don't want to take anymore of your time. No worries, my dear. And send Alice a kiss. Bye. You really think you scare me with your accent and your portable TV? I don't scare anyone. Now, Mara, you should see her at court. She'd, as we say in Brazil, slay the house down on your face. I'm not aware of these vulgar expressions. You're not aware of many things. If you'll excuse me, a school doesn't run by itself. I don't know if you know, but I created this perfume Golden Peach by Oxygen that you must be using ever since it came out about… 20 years ago. One phone call, and I take it off the market. Great choice, by the way. Daddy… Why do I exist? What kind of question is that? I just screw myself, so why do I exist? Alice... You exist to shine. And I've been living on the edge. I didn't notice. Meow Hi, folks. After days without posting anything, I decided to go live. A tutorial for those who went through a dramatic week and need to plaster that panda shadow under the eyes. I'm going to use a base that I usually use in my day-to-day. And… I'm already getting messages. Sandra says she misses me. Me too was I missing so much this contact. You can't imagine how much. And... Carol says: “Who thinks I could look good after a week of shit.” I don't know if you were sincere, but thanks. And Rafa says: "Here's the link where he pi… pisses himself..." FAG PISSES HIMSELF IN THE CLASSROOM. - Hey, kitty. - Hey Alice. We came to cheer you up. Come for a ride with us, and frighten the town. I'll show you a place really “pa”. - “Pa”? - Paradisiacal. I see your sad eyes. But you insist. To be silent. We go crazy. Everyone knows It's much nicer up there. Alice will like it. I don't know if I came with the right clothes. Alice, forget it. Feel this air. If I don't feel a snake bite, that'll be just great. Keep cool, Alice. Our spot is just up front. Let's run! The sun's setting. Let's go! Do not be afraid, I read in a "Haikai". Our life looks like a eighties teen movie. Oh, shit. I don't remember which way is the shortest. Oh, Bruno, seriously? Taisa! Taisa! Knowing her, she's already up ahead. My mother told me to be a boy and not to discuss. But I'm stubborn and wanted to be a travesti. T way. Come here, Alice. Oh Bruno. I don't know. It's really high. Come on! Trust me. It's not dangerous. So? It's beautiful. Can you see Recife from here? - It's right there after those trees. - Really? Of course not, Bruno. Taisa says great things about you. - Oh, yeah? - Yes. She says you're very beautiful. When I saw you at school, I never imagined you were a trans. That's a terrible thing to say to a trans. Really? Really. Because it shows that for me to look like a woman, I have to be pretty. And I'm a woman, whether or not I'm pretty. After all, what is it to be pretty? You're right. My bad. - Where's Taisa? I'm worried. - Relax. She can take care of herself. Sorry about the thing I told you not looking like a trans. This is all really new to me. Would you ever date a trans? I already have a girlfriend. The city looks so small from here. From far, everything's pretty small, fragile. It gives you another aspect of existence, of why we exist. - Yeah? What aspect? - I don't know. Why's it some things are if they're not meant to be? - This is really stoners' talk. - A bit. What's that? Just a habit. - But you do that, like for real? - I do, yeah. - Do some rhymes. - I don't know how to rhyme. Improvise. Just say some truths like Nicki Minaj. - Go. - All right. Wait... People don't understand me, they have no patience. But what they don't know is that my body's resistance. Holy crap. Where did that come from? I don't know. From my life. - Did I missed the sunset? - Run! It's almost gone. - Ahhh. - Thanks. It's getting cold, no? So Alice. What do you think? You really wanna know? Our Lady of Redemption will have to deal with a trans student, yes. And who's not happy can go to hell! - Go, Alice! - Go, Alice! Go, Alice! Go, Alice! Confronting lions! Confronting. Taking over something that's in place of another… Confronting lions! Confronting. Taking over something that's in place of another… Bite! The skin is wounded. Stick to the trail, in the field and go on with life! In the end... Sadness is a false friend. Teach to confront lions. All right. What's the stupid joke now? Relax, Alice. We wanted to invite you to my traditional spring-coming pool party. And you couldn't be left out. I've always wanted to tell you I was cheering for you in the “Next Teen Top Model”. Oh, and the invite's for two people. So bring your sweetheart along if you want. We'll see you there? YOU ARE INVITED TO MANOELA'S POOL PARTY Alice. Do you realize what just happened? You were invited to Manoela's legendary pool party. I've been here three years and have only heard about it. You'll have to take me! Am I hearing right? Viviane Amorim, the paladin of the oppressed wants to go to the Barbie Doll party? I heard there's pole dance championship, with Vodka shots! Guilherme! - You'll break it. - Wow, how cute. Give it back! I think it broke… It broke? The screen's cracked. My mom hasn't even finished paying for it yet! Why don't you pick on someone your size? Fight, fight. Would that be you, you Paraibano shit? - I'm not even Paraibano, you shit head. - Fight, fight. Don't' go, Alice! What did you call me, shemale? You didn't catch my accent? I'll say it your way: SHIT HEAD. Fight! Fight! Do you think that a trans person is a joke? No touching, no touching! TRANS GIRL TAKES REVENGE ON CYBERBULLYING My! What negative energy we have here. Where were we? Have you seen in what state my son is because of that aberration? Weigh your words when talking about my daughter. Your son is unbalanced, Laura. It's been a while that Lino complains about him at home. Some kind of strong lack is affecting him. You should pay attention to that. You're going to teach me how to take care of my kid? From you, who can't even raise a man. I'm alone at home, and I raised Alice very well. - Alice is incapable of hurting a fly. - Right, Guilherme is one to talk. Maybe he's a good-for-nothing. Enough! You're dismissed. Why only her? - It's not the baby doll's fault. - Baby doll? He's just a victim. As for you two, there's nothing to discuss about. Violence is not permitted in this school. This time, three-day suspension. Next time, expulsion. Did you have to use your fists with that boy? - What did you expect me to do? - Use your intelligence! - He deserved it. - I didn't raise you to be like that. You know your facts. You're evolved. Fighting is for savages. You have to be patient. Easy for you to say, dad. Male, white, cis and straight. - I'm not falling for that one! - Gotta recognize your privileges. - Alice! - Hey! Wait for me in the car. - Hi. - Hi. I wanted to thank you for your daughter's defending my son today in the courtyard. Alice sometimes gets out of control. I'd like to invite you both for lunch at home with us tomorrow. Lino doesn't have many friends. I think it would be cool for him to have company his age. Alice needs to leave the house a bit, too. I think that's what's driving her crazy. - So, tomorrow at noon? - All right. - All right then. See you. - Bye. I invited your friend over to have lunch with us tomorrow. - Mom, she's not... - My friend. Why don't you show your studio to your friend? - No Marisa. Thanks, I'm fine. Seriously. - She'll love it... I'm sure. Come on. Take her there. My God! They hate each other. Don't touch anything. I organized it yesterday. - Are they yours? - Well, yes. They're beautiful. You should put on a fashion show. Right. Put on a fashion show, and parade to whom? At the knitwear fair of Araucarias do Sul? I want to go to a fashion school and flee this place. By the way, have you heard of a program called “Next Teen Top Model”? Yes, Alice. I know who you are. How couldn't I know about the fuss you made in the finals? Sincerely, I think these reality shows just fetishize the fashion world. What a pity. That's where I met Alexandre Nakabuki. You know Nakabuki? Yeah. I paraded in his last year's summer collection. My God! You've already worn a Nakabuki. His last trainee became so famous that in just a year, he started his own brand. What do you think if I sent him some pictures of me wearing your clothes? - You'd do that for me? - I broke a brat's nose for you, Lino Neto. This place you have here is incredible. Yeah. You can forget the world. I mean, I forget. Not Lino. He's always connected. It's impressive. Look. I've always had this sweet Araucaria here at home. - It's the Imperial Pine? - Yes, it is. Inside the cone, there's a hidden flower. That reveals itself with the blow of who has discovered its true essence. It's a lovely story, but it's just a folktale. I've tried that a thousand times. Now, let's get down to business. This is the part I like the most. Try it. This is incredible. Are you a botanist? Biologist? I'm a boozer. And as you say: Voilà! This is my breadwinner. Come taste the cachaça I made with the sap of the sweet Araucaria. Try it. - Did you like it? - Like it? I think I'm gonna have an orgasm. Alice used to embarrass her mom and I so much. Oh, you're exaggerating. No, I'm not. - Alice has such a dirty mouth. - Really? I tell her: Alice, finesse. A bit of finesse. It's useless. One day, when she was 9... the pediatrician told her jokingly... that she was becoming a little man. Do you know what she did? She told him to go get fucked. You're laughing because it's not your problem. Lino's very sweet. Sweet? Lino... Lino's a devilish bitch. He's my son. I love him! But he is. - A toast to them. - A toast. To the devilish bitch and the dirty-mouthed trans. So, who starts? Here, Alice. Here. Until you know it by heart. Until you know it by heart. Cut their heads. Until you know it by heart. Until you know it by heart. Until you know it by heart. Until you know it by heart. - Until you know it by heart. - No touching, no touching! Alice. Wake up. Alice, wake up. Alice. Alice, wake up. Wake up, creature. Damn it, Viviane. Let me sleep. - Right, and miss the pool party? - Who throws a party at this time? - Alice, let's go! Bruno will be there. - What does Bruno have to do with this? Well, it's just that you like all the pictures he posts. You think I'm blind? Stalker alert on you, Viviane. Stop saying these things. I don't wanna cause any trouble. Taisa is my friend. - I'm much more on your side. - Me, too. Now, leave me. - Let's go, girl. Get up! - Damn it, Viviane. You talk too much. My God! I'm just here to wake you up. Let's go! - Nobody gets up before seven. - Of course they do. Everybody does. Five o'clock and I'm up. Hurry Ali… Fuck! Come on. You got to get up now! - We're gonna be super late. Let's go! - It's seven in the morning! It doesn't matter. We're almost there girls. We arrived. Yeah! Alice let's go, let's go. Dad, do I look feminine? - You're beautiful. - That's not what I asked. Alice. If you need me, call me and I'll be right over. Hey, welcome. Come here. Let's take an official picture. Wait, wait. Don't forget to check in, and to put #PoolParty on the pictures. This is too normative! Now that we're here, we'll have to stay. - The pisser! - Ignore him. Hey pisser! Seriously, I wanted to thank you. You just made me win the game. The Joker was the Queen of Clubs. A carmine colored lampshade... The blue bed sheet. Silk curtains... On your naked body. The best thing about this party is your look. It's really sickning, by the way. Oh, Thanks Vivi. Hi. - Hi, Taisa. - Hi. In all the beds I sleep there's only you… - Are you avoiding me? - Me? No. Are you thinking of going in the water? I can't. You've got your period, too? I don't have periods, Taisa. But thanks for the compliment. I'm not wearing a bikini. I'm using padding underneath. - Next. - I'm next Guilherme. Let's massacre these dorks. I'm good at truco. Thanks, but I'd prefer to keep some distance. I'm in. Venom girl. You have a serene way of being. And every night in my room comes to numb me. Numb me. Numb me, yeah, yeah. - Holy shit! - What's up? - The water's great, isn't it? - Yeah. How cool you came and that you haven't died of boredom yet. So you knew this party was a compound gathering. Taisa is friends with these Barbie Dolls. So I come along... just to see their faces when they see a black guy swimming in their pool. Nine. Go down, son of a bitch, down. You lost so badly you little shit head. Next. Sorry, but I'm not leaving Alice alone. Although she's in very good company. Bruno. Play with me. Looks like they killed your joy. Viviane, stop. This party's such a flop that… Gaga would save it. If Gaga were playing, it would be much better. - They should put on Gaga. - Shouldn't they? That's what I'm saying... - Get off, let me go! - Stop with that, stop! - Get off, let me go! - Let me go, stop! - Get off, let me go! - Stop! Let me go! - Leave her alone! - Let me go! - Let me go! - Stop with that! Let me go! Get off, let me go! Let her go! Stop with that! Stop with that! If you mess with one of us, you mess with us all! If you mess with one of us, you mess with us all! If you mess with one of us, you mess with us all! Manoela, tell the girls to put their tops back on. - Otherwise, I'm sending everyone home! - Then you'll have to include me too. Let's go. FEMINIST BATHROOM. What the hell is this? - Now if you wanna piss, you need a sorority. - Sininho? Sininho is fucking dead. Now, I'm Rita Rubão! I baptized her. Isn't it lovely? You're tougher than Alice. Inside the cone, there's a hidden flower that reveals itself with the blow of who has discovered its true essence. Eureka! I slayed it. I slayeeeeeeeeeeed it! Not now, dad. I'm recording. Hunty, you're really sickning no? So folks, after a dark period getting f***ed around… I can say that I'm over it. And I'm back with one more: Alice Answers. Miss me? Send a kiss to the “pocs”. (feminine queers) May it rain letters. - May it rain letters. - Oh, right. Not to mention the vlog. The first question is from Izabelle. "Alice, how do you manage to be in peace with your body?" "I'm not a trans person, but I'd like to have your confidence. Iza... my body is my body. It doesn't matter what they say. It's the body of a woman. Don't fight with it. Don't make it your enemy. Instead, fight with it to be who you feel you are. Put your face in the sun honey. The second question is from Rudy. "So, girl, have you kissed yet?" A kiss... Rudy, no I haven't yet. But I feel that things will… Soon, there'll be more information. Samy is asking: Alice, "what's your last achievement?" Cool question Samy, because there were many. Alice. - Hi, Jean. - Hi. How's it going? - Daddy, come here. - Alice. - Sorry. - Vivi, confetti. Uieee. Dad, answer Samy's question: What's your last great achievement? My last great achievement? Smell this. I've just discovered the secret of the Imperial pinecone. Stunning, dad! We're going back to Recife. What? - Are you Ok? - Oh, daddy... I... I don't know. Bo, I can't believe you're coming back. Give me the day and time and I'll be there waiting for you. A party. Let's have a party. Kisses, I love you. I can't believe it either. Come dance with me. - I'm fine. - Come on. We could throw a farewell party. What do you think? Just for a few people, ok? Of course. This girl's a treasure. Golden butt. 18 karat ass, she has. She knows she's hot. She's put the house down. So spank it, it'll shine and go for it, too. Showing off all this wealth. Play naughty, play gently. Feel the motion, go slowly. Get ready girl, it's your turn to shine. She beats the drum with her butt. When the drum beats her butt. She beats the drum with her butt. When the drum beats her butt. When the drum beats her butt. When the drum beats her butt. This girl's a treasure. Golden butt... 18 karat ass, she has. Here you go, Vivi. Let's go girl. Relax. Let me fix you up. Turn around. Let's go. You're beautiful. Come back in half an hour. Best party! - I thought you weren't coming. - I'm gonna get a drink over there. What a face. - We had an argument before coming here. - Oohh... I just wanna have fun with you. Come. So folks, here's how it's gonna be. Tonight's the revolution. Everyone can be whatever they wanna be. Let your body love, express and transform itself. And if someone wants to leave their body, it's allowed. So move those hips, that ass, those boobs, those arms, those legs, those mouths because the night is just starting! Let's rooooooooock! My love. I warned you not to wait for me. I ain't no saint and the dance floor's on fire. You might be hot, but the DJ's calling me. I'm catching everything that moves... my love. I warned you not to wait for me. I ain't no saint and the dance floor's on fire. You might be hot, but the DJ's calling me. I'm catching everything that moves, my love. If you like me. If you like me. Slow down boy. What are you doing? No, no. Enough. Go back to the party. Relax, my darling. They'll survive. Forget all this. Let's go dance. I warned you not to wait for me. You've had enough, no? Just following your orders. I'm leaving my body. I've decided I wanna go to college in Recife. Are you telling me I'll never get rid of you? Never! So be forever welcome to Wonderland. Who told you to fall in love with me? That's your problem! The mistake is yours! That's your problem! The mistake is yours! My body drove you mad Problem, that's your problem I made it for you this afternoon. For your first tattoo. I tried to make something punk rock. It's pretty cute. I liked it. It's discrete. Seriously, I loved it. I already miss you. Me, too. But not now. Now's the time to enjoy that I'm still here. Let's go. A kiss for the DJ. A kiss for the MC. A kiss for the good folks. A kiss for the travesti. A kiss for the singles. A kiss for the gossipers. A kiss for the crazy ones. A kiss for the travesti. A kiss for the foreign ones. A kiss for the local ones. A kiss for the bunch. A kiss for the travesti. A kiss! A kiss! A kiss for the travesti! A kiss! A kiss! A kiss for the travesti! A kiss! A kiss! A kiss for the travesti! A kiss for the DJ.

That wasn't a kiss. My first kiss wouldn't be… Let me kiss your eyes. I just wanna touch your soul. Please don't ever let this go. There's no much time. Let me kiss your eyes. We never get that too close. You can take me on your own. There's no much time. We just need make each others night. So hold me tight. We'll make it last forever. So hold me tight. We'll make it last forever. Make each others night. So hold me tight. Make each others night. So hold me tight. We won't be here forever. Vivi, I finally kissed. I saw. You don't even have to thank me. Anyway, how was it? Yes, Vivi. It was great. We just need make each others night. So hold me tight. We'll make it last forever. So hold me tight. We'll make it last forever. Make each others night. So hold me tight. Make each others night. So hold me tight. We won't be here forever. Hey, Vivi, be careful with my look. The world's really a huge mess. I just know that we all leave a little trace behind wherever we go. And a little bit of love can always water a seed about to sow. They say it doesn't matter how far we are, we're always responsible for our happiness wherever we go. Araucarias do Sul, even in your smallness, you gave me the certainty I can face the world. It doesn't matter what you are, but who. To reach this idea, we must always let ourselves... TRANSform. So folks, you know me as Alice Junior. I'm a trans person, hard to beat, and ready for whatever comes my way. And who are you? (Subtitles: Emmanuel Rosset, Adam Fischler, Byron Emes) I've prepared my grounds. I came to say why I come. To transform is what I do. To overflow, conquer space. I'm not afraid of the future. Soon there will be no walls. Our body is our home. Here I love and will live. I'm dancing to this beat. Swaying I make partners. Joyful with resistance, And slaying everything I go. I'm dancing to this beat. I have more tickets... Come, come! Everyone's invited to see the pride parade of being... Me! I've prepared the plot. I bring along my ghetto. No one here gets put down. And when they dance, the walls tremble. I'm not afraid of the future. I've learned to take down the walls. My body is my safe haven. And nobody will bring me down. I'm dancing to this beat. Swaying I make partners. Joyful with resistance, And slaying everything I go. I'm dancing to this beat. I have more tickets... Come, come! Everyone's invited to see the pride parade of being... I resist. I don't omit myself. I arrive dancing samba to the beat. I don't need an invitation. Today, the party is ours. The drumbeat continues. While there's a queer in the street. That's why I invite you. Transforming is your cure. Come to the party. Make it happen, the world is your house. Nobody will butt in. Come to the party. Make it happen. Gather your friends until the break of dawn. Knocking down prejudice. Transcending this power. I'm dancing to this beat. Swaying I make partners. Joyful with resistance, And slaying everything I go. I'm dancing to this beat. I have more tickets... Come, come! Everyone's invited to see the pride parade of being... Me!
