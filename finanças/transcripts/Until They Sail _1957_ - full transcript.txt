Now, Major Harding did you know Delia Leslie Friskett personally? Yes, I knew her but only casually. It was the other Americans who knew her, personally. Well, will you tell us, in what connection you knew her mainly? I was sent to investigate. That was my job. - Investigate what? - 'Her marriage.' Her marriage to Friskett? Of what interest was that to you? No, not her marriage to Friskett. Well then, major, her marriage to whom? To a marine. 'An American marine?' Yes, an American marine wanted to marry her. But she was already married. She didn't tell the marine that. And he applied for permission to marry her. 'And you were sent to investigate?' 'Yes.' Is that customary? 'Yes, always.' You mean to tell me that all New Zealand girls who wanted to marry American servicemen were investigated? That's right. Tell me, major, what kind of a woman did you find Delia Friskett to be? What kind of a woman was Delia? Was she so different from her three sisters? All four of were lonely. We lived in a country of women without men. Is it so hard to understand? To forgive? It happened to us in New Zealand the way it happened in other countries where the men went marching off to war. Barbara, there's Mark. - Mark - Mark. Mark. Aren't you gonna wave to him, Barbara? He knows I see him, Evelyn. Mark, my darling, I hardly know you. I hardly know my husband. A month, a small month. I don't see Kiff. Does anybody see Kiff? He's kissing some Sheila goodbye, if I know brother Kiff. Hope he remembers that people will know his fathers son. Hope he behaves himself. I hope he has a fine time. I hope we all have a fine time. As fine a time as they can have. Well I do. Look, Delia. There's three of your beaus all in a row. Nice that they can be together. They can compare notes. Evelyn, don't be a tease pot. Christchurch is going to become a tea party sort of place. We're all gonna become gossipin' old maids and spinsters. Only without the men, there won't be anything to gossip about, anything. 'Delia!' Hello, Shiner. Ladies. Fine posse of men, wasn't it? My brother Kit's with them and Barbara's husband, Mark. Well I decided here was the place for shining. Uh, defending my homeland. 'And the honor of the girls they left behind.' Well now, one pin for Kit and one for Mark. Who'll be in charge of Kits'? You're one of the bright particular favorite, which pin do you want? 'White, red, black, blue?' Red's a happy color. Red for brother, Kit. Where shall I put it? You can see their ships going upto Wellington now. Then I'll put it there. There you are, Kit. Have a fine time. A fine time! I think I'll take the white one for Mark. When Tommy goes, I'll take-- The war will be over before Tommy goes. - He's seventeen. - Well we hope it'll be over. When Tommy goes, I'll take the black one. It's romantic. Black. That's more than one you can save for Tommy. I'm sorry. Somehow I think there ought to be a pin for dad. Even though he is gone, so if nobody minds I'd like to put one in for him...there. Well...I think what we need is a nice cup of tea. Come on. Your answer to everything is a nice cup of tea. It gives you some thing to do. Get's you past the moment. We'll have to drink an awful lot of tea to get us past all the moments we're in for. Dee.. Alright. Stiff upper lip and all of that. It's happened. It's happened. - What has, Dee? - I'm engaged. I'm engaged. Well, isn't anyone pleased? What's the matter with you two? We're delighted for you, Dee. Aren't we, Anne? Who's the lucky man? - Shiner Phil, who else? - Shiner? Well, that's wonderful. When are you gonna get married? Yes, when is the happy day? What's bothering you, Anne? You parading the fact that you hate men. - I don't. - I know you don't. Anne.. Dee.. Darling.. ...Kit's dead. Where? A place called, Lamia. Where's that? Greece, but I can't find it on the map. Lamia? And I thought that.. Has anyone told, Evelyn? 'Not yet.' I better tell her. I will. What does it matter where they die? They all die in some horrible lost village. You know as well as I do that one by one, they'll all be lost. 'Oh, Barbara. I'm sorry.' Oh, it's alright. Mark's alright. He'll be alright. Just that I'm sick with fear.. ...they'd die out there and leave us to Shiner. You know if mother or dad were alive.. ...Shiner wouldn't even be allowed in the house. Let alone marry, Delia. Anne, Delia needs us very much right now. It's no use worrying about Delia. She's lost. Look here. Delia's going to be married in this house and you and I are going to be very nice to Shiner Phil. It's our only chance to save Delia from.. Well, from becoming a very unpleasant person. '...giving and receiving the ring and by joining hands.' 'I pronounce that you are man and wife' 'in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost.' 'Amen.' Now don't tell me you don't see the point of the story. - You see the-- - We see the point, Shiner. - Unfortunately. - Oh. Oh, you mean it ain't in good taste? Sorry. Knitting that for me, old girl. No. For the boys overseas. For Mark. I got the implication, thank you. Well, it may not be long before I'll be one of them. 'I've got a feeling, the army is blowing down my neck.' So, I'm lookin' into the Air Force. That's the sorta life. Give me a light, will you, Dee? Old girl, If you don't knit those tighter they'll make a better fish net than a sock. Perhaps you'd like to show me how. That's a good girl. I could if I wanted to. When I was knocking around Australia.. ...I picked it up. Did you work in Australia, some kind of job. You think I never worked in my life, don't you? Well I didn't work much in Australia, but I've worked. Just that never knowing when you're going to get called up. What's the use of starting a job you're going to leave. Besides.. ...Dee and I are just getting to know each other. 'As the reports of the Japanese attack' 'on Pearl Harbor spread around the world..' '...semiofficial sources in London said that' 'the British Empire would carry out Prime Minister Churchill's ' 'promise to give the United States full support' 'in the event of hostilities with Japan.' 'The Prime minister..' - Anything we haven't heard? - No. The same. What are you doing home this early? I've chucked my job. You've what? I've chucked my job. - Are you taking a new job? - Yes. - Doing what? What do you mean? - Now, Barbara-- Just that even before I've said anything you make it seem wrong. - I haven't said anything. - I know, that's what I mean. 'That is the end of the news from London.' Dee, what are you gonna do? I'm goin' up to Wellington. The Navy office. I can't stand Christchurch another day. - Now, go ahead and say it. - What? - That it's no good. - Oh, it's not good. You know yourself, it's no good. You in Wellington, alone? You wouldn't understand, Barbara. It's the terrible loneliness of Christchurch. You walk down Colombo Street after tea.. All women. It's like they're suspending life for two years. - 'And it'll go on.' - Dee.. What makes you think I don't understand? You love Mark, and you write to him and.. - I don't know. - Oh, it's still lonely. But you're right, I am luckier than you and Anne. Dee, you're going to Wellington because there'll be men there. Dee.. Do be careful. You're terribly attractive. 'It was officially announced that' 'the American fortress of Corregidor at the entrance' of Manila bay surrendered today.' 'It was the second day of the final Japanese assault' 'started on Tuesday..' 'Stop making those crosses.' Where's dad with his ship? where's Mark with the New Zealand Division? Where's kit? You know the men are needed where they are. Stop it. And even Shiner, never thought I'd feel any loyalty toward Shiner, but now that he is a prisoner and God knows what'll happen to him. I do, um...sorry we were so wretched to him. 'Barbara! Anne! Barbara!' 'Listen, listen!' Barbara! 'Oh, Barbara!' Barbara, Anne. Wait till you see it. You'll never guess what it is. Oh, look. - What is it? - Look. I'll show you. They say in town it's the Americans. It's about time. They've been about it long enough. Alright, you men. Square wire your gear. Check your equipment and standby. 'Alright already, get the lid up, come on snap it up.' There is a small charge for looking at me arms. What are you looking at? Ah, they're nuts. - Hey, come here a minute. - Why? - I want to ask you a question. - What? Come here. I'm sorry. You can't get shot for trying. - Hey, what's your name? - None of your business. The hoity type. Who cares? Never seen such a display of flashing white teeth in my life. They look as though they own the place already. Perhaps they do. The first sight of a man. Yes, in many, many months. It's quite wonderful. There's nothing but women in this town. - Are you complaining? - No men. Where are the men? - If you-- - Anne. Anne, please. Excuse me, I didn't say nothing. No. No, it's alright. That one must've killed off all the guys in this town. We ought to tell them where they are. Why embarrass them, they'll find out. I see someone's got to have a talk with her. It's the first time she's had a chance to flirt. And my sister, Barbara. She's a wonderful cook. Tell me something. How old are you? Fourteen. Why? You better wear a sign around your neck. "I am only fourteen." Oh. These are my sisters. - Barbara and Anne. - Hello. I've just invited Captain Bates to supper, Friday. - Oh. - Lotsa girls are inviting 'em. This is wonderful. We live way out of town up in the suburbs. - You really think you might-- - Oh, it's alright. I can't come anyway. I'm on duty. - My sister didn't mean to be-- - I understand. Then Saturday? Well, I have duty Saturday too. Thanks just the same. I have to get my men squared away. There were so many ships and only these few men? There are more of us in Wellington. We were there before they sent us here. It's much more exciting in Wellington. We've got a sister there, she went up there because it's much more exciting. Well, this looks alright to me. It's a nice town. I'm sure it's nothing compared to American towns. Why, it's different. It's more like England. - Oh, you know England? - Yes. My sister and I went back there to school. - We're glad you're here. - Thanks. The way the Japanese kept coming down the map. We were beginning to get afraid. Well, if we weren't afraid we were lonely. Honestly. - All squared away, sir. - Good. It's nice to have talked to you. My name's Evelyn. Evelyn Leslie. And these are my sisters, Barbara and Anne. You shouldn't just walk up to a soldier and ask him to supper. That's the sort of thing I can see Dee doing, not you. I'll bet Dee's doing it right now and having the time-- - Dee is married. - Oh, that's true. - But still.. - Now that's enough. I'm late getting back to work. Don't pick on Evelyn, what she's doing is perfectly normal for a girl and we don't want her sneaking out behind our backs. Don't see why I'm the one who's standing up for decent behavior. - We all want decent behavior. - Yes we all want it. What do we do about it. You let Dee go-- It was not a question of letting. Dee needed to be near family, especially now. I think one of us should go up and see Delia in Wellington. Dee is a married woman. I wonder if she's remembering she's married. Oh, it's all so crowded. Let's go somewhere else. Any place you say, I'm a stranger here myself. Come along, I'll show you. You take the friend. I'll take her. I've got a sister who might like to come along. I'd love to meet your sister. I'd like the room number of Mrs. Philip Friskett please. No. She maybe staying here as Mrs. Delia Friskett. No Friskett's at all. Perhaps, Delia Leslie. Oh, Miss Leslie. Yes. Room 724. Thank you. - Let's have something to eat. - No. I wanna have a drink. Come in. - Oh. - Dee. Barbara. Oh.. You're the last person I expected to see. I know. Let me look at you. Still the same old Christchurch girl. Hardly. You're not pulling up stakes too? - No. I bring news. - Oh-h. Shiner's alive. A prisoner, but alive. Thank God. 'It surprises you that I'm glad. Doesn't it.' No the only time you surprise me is when you don't surprise me. I prayed for the little idiot every night. I believe you. He's not so little. Compared to the Yank's, he is. I suppose so. We were wondering, Dee.. If perhaps you might come back home to Christchurch for a bit. Why? Oh, get the family together again. You're sweet, Barbara. Anne wouldn't have put it quite so nicely. 'I suppose all sorts of gossip has been..' ...trickling back to Christchurch. Hm? How about coming home, Dee? - I can't. - 'Think about it.' But I can't. Shiner's been away how long? And he'll be away, God knows how much longer. Mark's been away too, Dee. 'But you love Mark.' That's a terrible thing to say, isn't it? But you knew it all along. So you have someone to think about, plan for. I only want Shiner to come back so that we can get a divorce. Well that's honest, but...still.. I know you don't like the Americans. They're not...English and all that. But I like them. And someday I might like to go to America. I would give anything to go to America. But I'm married. And these boys are going off to the island. We only see each other until they sail. I don't know how to talk to you, Dee. I wish you wouldn't. It's hard enough. - Hiya, honey. - Andy, you made it. Oh, I told the commandant I had a little girl who didn't like her.. This is my sister, Barbara. Well, hi. - Hello. - Hello. You, uh.. You sure don't look much alike. - Oh, Dee is the pretty one. - No. No, no, you both.. - This is Andy. - Yes, how are you? I'm fine. Well, let's have a drink. You're sister looks okay, doesn't she? Yes. Fine. - Andy bought me this dress. - It's lovely. Say we got enough glasses, honey? Oh, none for me, thank you. Think I better be getting back. - But you just arrived. - I know, but.. Barbara.. I know this is tough to take. I was brought up the same as you and Delia. Thanks. Let's bottoms up a couple of these and hit the town. I'd like you to meet a guy. I rather not. Thank you. Hello. Hello Captain Harding's room, please. Well, try anyway. Sometimes he doesn't answer till he gets mad at the phone. I'm meeting Sally at 2 o'clock and no room. - Said he was in here somewhere. - Hello, Andy. - How you feeling boy? - All spoken for, son. - Where is that guy? - Why don't you join us, Andy? Suddenly, I'm the most popular guy. Hey, Andy, there's room over here. - Hiya, Del. - Hello. - De, I'm gonna duck outta here. - Oh, please hang on. - He said he'd meet here. - I don't wanna meet anyone. - I haven't seen you in months. - Delia, how are you? Come on, honey. Come on. He must be over here somewhere. Trust this guy to find a corner to hide in. Right. That's all we've been talking about. I know that you love your wife and I love.. Dr. Livingston, I presume? - Hi. Hi, Delia. - Hello, Jack. How come you wanted me to horn in your act? This is Barbara. Barbara, this is Jack Harding. Five bucks if you can make him smile. Order us a couple of whiskeys, will ya? - But Andy-- - Come on, honey. Oh, De. - I'm sorry. - Why? Being thrust at you like this. Well, uh, Andy's not very subtle. He's made it his primary mission in life to get me a girl. He seems to think I need the same kinda set up like he has with Delia. Delia is my sister. - Sorry. - And I'm married. Congratulations. It's funny you know. You Americans coming here sweeping all before you with you charm and your money. Then you look down on the girls who are nice to you. Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry I sound dreadful.. No, no, I understand, you've had it up to here. They're not like this at home. Delia's not like this at home either. In war, I guess nobody's really at home. Is your husband.. Last time I heard North Africa. Wow! That's a great game of musical chairs. The New Zealanders go to North Africa the North Americans come to New Zealand. And every place you've got this. Well, war makes strange bedfellows. Sorry. That was a poor joke. 'Hi, Jack.' - Oh, hi. - Hello, Jack. He's got a nice wife in California and a baby on the way. And you? Oh, I'm newly unmarried. - Sorry. - So am I. It's not the way I wanted it but.. ...we were very modern. Are you very modern here in New Zealand? Oh, people fall in and out of love here too. Yes. You smiled. Hell. I smile all the time. Oh, steward. - What do you want to drink? - I'll have a whiskey. Four whiskeys, please. Hey, five. Closing down your drinking places the way you do at 6:00 makes everybody tank up before sundown. Do you want a cigarette? Yes, thank you. Keep 'em. Legal tender of the occupying army. No, thank you. My wife was a chain smoker. And I could understand her doing.. ...practically anything for a cigarette. Sad. Uh, would you excuse me for a moment? I have family here in Wellington and I promised I'd call them before 5:00 and.. Well, I'll be back. I don't blame you for clearing out. It's a little confusing to me too. I wish I could go home. I hope your husband's alright. He's very lucky. Thank you. Dear Mark, I love you and I miss you. And as I read our poems each night I am close to you and think of you. And I'm grateful that I have you to keep me.. To keep me what? To keep me decent. It's not decent, it's not decent or proper the behavior of these.. Well, is it decent? What's happened to De, and the way they act. Nothing happened to Delia. She rushed into the experience herself. - And you left her there. - Yes, I left here there. Yes? - Yes? - May I help you? Uh, is this what they call sheer? Sheer? Where did you learn a word like that? - What's the matter with you? - Sheer? Is this the sheerest you got? Sheerest. Sheer, sheer. Come on, shut up. - Yes, it is. - Looks pretty cheesy to me. Cheesy, it's sheer, you dope, look. Down, Rover, down, down, down. - Is this for that penguin? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - How much is this? - That's one pound six. - What is that in legal money? - A buck and a quarter. A buck and quarter, this is sheer. Why don't you look where you're going. That's $4.20. - I'll take it. - What size do you want? I don't know. Your size. If it fits you, it'll fit her. This will be alright then. Uh, you wanna hold it up so I can see? Very nice. How'd you like one of these for yourself, huh? Will that be all? - Pardon me for breathing. - What's the matter with you? Don't you know a nice girl when you see one? Alright, show me one. Go ahead. Pigs. - Thank you. - Don't mind my friend, miss. He didn't even wear shoes before he joined the marines. - Pig. Come on. - This is what they call sheer. This man that Delia's with I suppose he calls her pig. Your sister a pig. I don't think so. I can't understand you, Barbara. I just know they were happy together. Happiness. But what about decency? Stop using that word. I've been thinking about writing to the papers about the way they behave. Been other letters on the subject. - Oh, Ann. - I'm going to. Nice girls with husbands and sweethearts away at war. - Pigs. - It's been 13 months. Some of them don't even remember what their husbands looked like. Try to understand them. I know you don't think I can. Yes? Oh, hello. Hello, I've come from headquarters to apologize on behalf of the marine corps who to Anne Leslie. Are you Anne or Barbara? I'm Anne. What're you apologizing for? It's your letter in the paper today headquarters is very upset about it. Didn't realize it would attract such attention. I have been instructed to say that America appreciates deeply the courtesies your country has extended us. We know our intrusion is bound to cause friction. 'We regret that. Indeed we do.' Oh, thank you. Won't you come in? Thanks. Headquarters wants to know if you wish to make any specific complaint. No, I'm sorry, I really don't. Thanks for taking that attitude. That's very generous of you. I'm sure they have reasons. Men away from home.. You people have been kind in that respect. Letting the men in your homes. I'm sure the boys that you've entertained didn't act the way these men did in the store. The truth is that we haven't entertained any. I suppose we should have. You see, both our parents are dead and it makes it a little more difficult. You have a lovely place. It's like an English cottage. Yes, you said you had been in England, didn't you? Yes, I-I was at Oxford, I was a Rhode scholar. Well.. Have you, I mean, I suppose you've had lots of invitations. Actually none since your little sister's that first day. 'Anne, who is it?' Well, that was my fault I'm afraid. But you all did seem rather overwhelming that day, right? I guess we did. You thought that we'd bring our trucks to dinner or something. I don't know what's for supper but you can come if you like.. ...and give me a chance to apologize for my rudeness. Oh, I'm afraid I trapped you into that invitation. We usually have supper at 6:30. Can I bring something and help out? Oh, no thanks. We've quite enough. 'Anne.' Who on earth are you talking...oh! - Hello, I'm Richard Bates. - Yes. I've invited Capt. Bates for supper tonight. Good. He came to apologize for the marine corps in my letter. Yes, her letter was referred to our office and I.. ...well, I.. - Supper's at 6:30. - I've already told him. - Oh. - 6:30 then. He said that the boys who were entertained by families here acted better. - Thought we oughta do our bit. - Of course. We'll have coffee in the other room by the fire. Can I help with the dishes? What's the matter? - That's women's work. - Oh, not where I come from. Oh, no, no, really. Is it a crime for a man to wash dishes? I can just see dad doing the dishes. We'll, do them later, thank you. Shiner left some cigars. Oh, darling, it's been so long, they dry out. Oh, that's alright, I've got cigarettes. Obviously this is where I'm supposed to sit. - It was dad's chair. - And Marks. Well, I'm an unworthy successor but I won't complain. Capt. Bates, what color do you want to be? What do you mean? Well, this is Mark. And this is Shiner. He's Delia's husband. That's our sister in Wellington. This is where dad's ship sank. And this is Tommy. A friend of mine. You can be purple, orange, pink. I don't think I really belong up there. Why not this green one to match your uniform? I still don't think Irate it, but thanks. It will give Anne a pin to move around.. Where'd you hang my coat? - Oh, you're not going? - No. It's in the hall. Evelyn, come and help me do the cleaning. - Oh, no please don't. - You can clean up later. I want to look at him. I have something for you. Probably wrong kinds. Perfume but it's all PX had. You can give 'em to someone else. Not me. Evelyn, if I remember right, this is spring fancy. - Very appropriate. - Thank you. Barbara, here's something called heaven scent. S-C-E-N-T. Did you know this is the first present I've had from a man? Well, it's about time. And because you're the one who invited me, Anne. This is called, believe it or not, merci bien. 'Or as we say in Oklahoma, thanks a lot.' I'm sorry. Well, it's...it's just that today's my birthday. So many of the girls have been getting gifts from you Americans, you know? Americans like to give gifts. Oh, you're very generous. But it's all got involved with.. ...well.. What do I do now? You said you could wash dishes. I'm sorry, Barbara. It's just that, he was, well, so nice. And all of a sudden those presents from the PX and then we were like the other girls scavenging from Americans. My mother always taught my sisters it was alright to accept the following gifts from a man candy, flowers and perfume. Even asked him to dinner that very first day. Come on. Wonder where. - 'He'll be back.' - 'Of course.' No rumors even to go by. At the shop today, they said our troops are farther west then that in North Africa. - Oh, where? Did anyone know? - Hmm, Tobruk. It's a wire. I-I saw him coming up the path from my window. I-it's Richard telling you he can't come tonight. Yes, Mr. Hall. Evelyn. Oh, Anne. 'The official communicate goes on to report' 'that the six months long battle for Guadalcanal' 'is now in its final stages.' 'Casualties are heavy, and more American marines' 'have been flown to New Zealand for hospitalization.' '"So that was Christmas..' '"You'll be pleased to know that Betty and I' "are doing our patriotic bit by going to the USO and dancing. "If you can call it dancing, with the boys. "Some of them are real creeps, some real cute. "Some French sailors in the other night.. "...believe it or not "and my high school French came in mighty handy. "Particularly, the word no. "Well, Dick, that's all the sisterly chatter for now. "Get someone to write a letter for you. Love from us all, Audrey." Oh, you've got a visitor. It's Anne Leslie. Oh. I'm sorry I couldn't make it for dinner. - Previous engagement. - I'll clear out now, Dick. - Thanks, doc. - See you later. I brought a few flowers from our garden. Flowers in January? This is sure an upside down country. How'd you find I was here? I asked. Why? I wanted to know. - How are you? - Oh, I'm fine. Don't let this thing on my eyes frighten you. They'll be fine. They don't want me looking at things yet. I'd like to come and read to you if they allow. - Sure. - Or write letters for you. Thanks. - Barbara, Barbara. - Hmm. Are you awake? Well, I am now. What is it? - You would never believe it. - Believe what? - Iceberg Anne. - Who? Anne. She's out front nicking her head off. Well, of course I believe you. Now go to sleep. I think it's wonderful. Our Anne and an American. Evelyn, do you know what a peeping Tom is? How am I ever going to learn anything? Believe me. Not by watching. - Is she going to marry him? - None of our business. Now get back to bed. Go on. Scoot. Tell me, what do you think of all the marriages between Americans and New Zealand girls? I don't think you wanna know what I think. I think you wanna tell what you think. One girl married a man from California. When she got there, she took one look at his home and turned right around and came back. Could happen. I-I haven't heard of anyone who went to your state Oklahoma and came back. That's nice to know. Tell me, do you approve of these marriages between Americans and New Zealand girls? Evelyn, curiosity killed the cat. And satisfaction brought him back. Okay, okay. I was going to ask Barbara if it'd be alright for me to marry Anne. You seem to be the most concerned. - So do I have your permission? - You bet. Do we have your permission too, Barbara? Of course. When? Where? How? What are the particulars? Well, there's only one particular. Admiral Halsey. Permission? Yes, but I'll start the machinery tomorrow. - Give us a little warning. - It'll be a while yet. Sometimes they act a little faster for men who may be moving north. Nobody knows when, but the press would.. Well, I will be going sometime. So if you'd like to think it over, Barbara. You and Anne have thought it over. That's the only important thing. Perhaps they'll decide to leave you behind this time. And anyway, we have until you sail. 'Along with the displeasure of the point of attack' 'of theAmerican marines' 'came reports of staggering numbers of casualties.' 'The marine landing on Tarawa' 'may perhaps be the costliest operation' 'to date in the Pacific War.' 'Early reports indicate that the landing was a Persian force' 'with the marines having to dig in on the beaches' 'only a few feet from the point of landing.' Tarawa. That's where they've gone. Where's that? One of the Gilbert Islands. It was due north. I've never heard of it. First reports of casualties.. No names yet, just fantastic numbers. Richard will be alright. When he comes back, permission will have to have gone through. You'll be married and it won't all be so rushed. Barbara, I'm going to have a baby. Oh, Anne. Dick will come through alright. We both knew the ships were sailing soon, some other island. Anne, you don't have to justify yourself to me. Everything's changed so much. The way I used to feel about Delia and.. Now I understand her a little. Of course it's convenient for me to understand her now. Makes me feel a little less alone and guilty. Darling.. What should we do, Barbara, if Dick doesn't get back? He will. It would be unfair if this family loses anyone else. If he doesn't, I'd like to have the baby here if you let me. Let you? Whose home do you think this is? How Delia would laugh. I don't think so. I'd like to phone Delia. Oh...I won't say anything about Dick and.. Well...I won't say anything probably, but.. ...just to talk to her. Suddenly feel I want to talk to her. Hello, I want a personal call, please. To Mrs. Delia Friskett at the St. George Hotel in Wellington. Oh, uh, Delia Leslie. Oh, um, Delia Leslie. Thank you. I'll hold on. 'Let it ring.' 'Let it ring, Delia.' Hello. Yes, this is Delia Leslie. It's my sister. Hello, Anne, hello. No, nothing's wrong. We just thought we'd call. I'm fine. How are you? Oh, I'm fine. Uh, how's Barbara? Yes, yes, I'm fine. How's Evelyn? Oh, Evelyn's well. She's not here but Barbara's here. Say hello to Barbara. Hello, De. How are you? Yes, fine. I take it everything's good with you? Yes, I'm well. Well, I mean to write.. Yes, I'm fine. Fine. Well, it's good to talk to you. We will. Say goodbye to Anne. Goodbye, De. Keep well. And remember, we love you and miss you. Goodbye, De. Take care. I will. And thank you for calling. Goodbye. 'Give me a beer, huh?' - 'Now what?' - Will you shut up? Why do they have to call me? - You've gotta go back now. - Why? Oh, you. Always asking why when you know perfectly well. Why? You got some kinda monster inside that house you don't want me to see? I bet one of your sisters have got two heads. - Go on home. - Home? what do you mean home? I only meant I've gotta go in now. I'll see you when you get off next. Well, maybe you will or maybe you won't. When I was a kid I used to carry girls books home. - Well, I ain't no kid no more. - Well, that's up to you. Bye. Lots of girls walk with American soldiers. They're real keen. - Darling, you're only 15. - He's only 18. I wish you wouldn't go with soldiers. Oh, for a couple of years yet. Iceberg Anne went with one, and everything turned out swell. Maybe not so...swell. Why? Because...Anne's going to have a baby. Oh! Alright, I'll do what you say. I won't walk with Americans till I'm 17. What's this about Americans? I just met a nice Yank. We've been walking together. Let's agree on one thing. If you wanna talk to a soldier you'll bring him home to meet us. That's fair enough. Anne, you ruined it. She just promised not to see any Americans until she was 17. But, Barbara, she's almost grown. - Hello. - Hello. - This is a surprise. - Yes. I met this officer up in Wellington when I went to see Delia. For about ten minutes. Uh, I'm looking for Anne Leslie. - I'm Anne Leslie-- - Oh, I'm sorry. This is my sister. Anne, major.. Harding. Has something happened to Richard Bates? No, no, nothing like that. I've been given the hazardous duty of checking on girls that Americans wanna marry. I looked over the forms that Bates filled out and I've interviewed your minister, your friends your neighbors and you're as good as married. Oh, and the, uh, the American government out of the goodness of its heart wants to give you this present. Oh, thank you. If you're going to live in Oklahoma we want you to learn about it. We give lectures for brides-to-be at the Young Eagles Club. Uh, the lecturer's a bore, but he means well. I guess all bores do. Well, you can tell your captain that everything's cleared. He's at Tarawa. Is there any way you could find out? They won't let us have the casualty list yet. Red tape. You know, I often think that it must be harder on you people. I mean, waiting for word from Africa and now Tarawa. Barbara's husband was killed last year. I'm sorry. I didn't know. How could you? Well, don't forget your homework. Don't worry. You'll be in Christchurch for a while then? I'll be in and out until they certify me for combat duty again. Why do American lighters always work? You were very nice to Anne at the meeting tonight. - Thank you. - Line of duty. No, she's nice. - This Bates.. - He's nice too. Maybe it will work. It's more than you think of most of these war marriages I take it? Mm-hmm. Why? Because most of the people involved were just lonely. You know these guys come in and they say they never knew what true love was before they met the girl. Well, the truth is, they, they never knew what real loneliness was before they came here. Yeah, but the girls.. Well, it's a little easier to understand them when you realize that our men have been away for more than three years. So, there's loneliness everywhere. And hunger, yeah. There you are. Come on, let's get out of here. Eat, drink and make love, for tomorrow we die. That's Delia's way of fighting the loneliness. Yes. Anne's is another. A different way. But if Richard Bates is dead in Tarawa, where's she? She's gonna have a baby, isn't she? Yeah. Now, why do I wanna say that's nice? 'Cause it isn't nice. Not according to the standards that I was brought up by and you too, I'm sure. But I wanna say that's nice. For them to have known, uh the sweetness and the comfort of love before he dies. He mustn't be dead. Yeah, but if he is.. ...then the sweetness turns sour. Time will see to that. And Bates' a nice guy. While he lies dying in a ditch, what's he gonna think? Poor Anne, what did I do? And there you are. Oh, that's where Delia, Anne and Dick are, but.. ...where are you? This is what I spend the night with. And no regrets. Oh, I get a gentlemanly hangover in the morning, but no regrets. And nobody gets hurt. What's the matter? Nothing. Okay. What's your solution? Well, you said it was.. ...three years of hunger and loneliness. I've gotta go in now. Evelyn's alone. No, don't bother. I hope everything's alright. Thank you. What do you do now? Go to your quarters and get drunk? - Cold-blooded, isn't it? - Yes. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Barbara, uh, this is Max. - Max Murphy. - Hi. Hello, Max. Babs, Max thinks you make wonderful cakes. - Oh, yeah, they're great. - Well, thank you. I was just down learning a lot about your country. A meeting where they're indoctrinating prospective American brides. Are you one of them? No. Just curious. You sure don't look like most of them look. I saw the last bride ship leave for the States. I wouldn't touch 'em with someone else's ten-foot pole. - Have another cake, Max. - Oh, that's alright. You know, I think most of the guys just got hooked. - Some gratitude. - Gratitude? For what, Max? Oh, I mean, savin' your country. Oh, well, were you at Guadalcanal, Max? Well, no. I just come off from Hawaii a couple of weeks ago. Oh! But I'm away from home now, for over a year, trainin'. - Have you now? - Have you really? Yeah, it's been plenty rugged. Anne, this is Max. Max Murphy. - Hello, Max. - Anne. Barbara. Oh, Evelyn, you entertain Max. Excuse me. - What's the matter? - I don't know. I think your sister Barbara's mad at me. That crack about the bride ship. - No. - Is she married, Barbara? - She's a widow. - Oh! What about Anne? Is Anne married? Anne's...not married. 'You've changed the way you wear your hair.' When I left it was different. Or is this an optical illusion? Can I cut in? Thank you. - Hello, where have you been? - Up in Wellington. - Investigating brides? - Yup. Same hazardous mission. Oh, did you see Delia by any chance? No. - How's Anne? - Fine. I understand that the permission for her marriage came through a week ago. It's filed. - Does she hate Dick Bates now? - No. - Herself? - No, nobody. That's nice. Has she been advised of her rights? What do you mean? There's a board she can appeal to for the support of the illegitimate-- We don't need that. Thank you. We don't like thinking of it in that way. Alright. However, it's nice of them setting up a board to have the whole thing organized. Anne may not hate anybody, but you do, don't you? No. Just the war. Sorry. What are you doing here anyway? I didn't think you came to dances. It's part of my job to show up at this.. How about you? Oh, I'm chaperone, you know. Old married woman. Who chaperones the chaperons? - No, did someone bring ya? - No. 'Barbara.' I told you that practice is gonna pay off, huh? Just stay loose, kid, 'cause here I go. Whole new bunch got in today. Most of mine leave from the forward areas. Oh! And tomorrow morning the office will be swarming with guys with hangovers muttering that they never knew what true love was before and please can they marry the girl. I've got a car with some $100 punch in the glove compartment. - Would you like to, uh.. - No, thank you. Okay. So you're still carrying on your hot affair with the bottle? Yup. I'll hear from that in the morning. And what will you say to him? Same thing my father said to me when I wanted to get married. Oh! I met my wife.. ...during Easter vacation in Bermuda. I was a senior in college. I'd never seen her before. The setting was perfect. Just like this one. The girl was beautiful. And there she was shimmering in the moonlight. Don't make fun of it. Maybe I shouldn't. Well, my father.. "What do you know about the girl? What she likes and dislikes?" "Dad," I said, "she likes to kiss in the moonlight. "And she dances like a dream. And I was never in love before and I never will be again." Sounds lovely. Yup, and so they were married. Six years later they became a statistic in the divorce records. I loved her, but I didn't like her. And she liked me, but she didn't love me. How was a guy supposed to know? So, do you tell the boys that once back in Bermuda there was a moon like this one a girl you'd only known for a week, et cetera, et cetera? No. But I try to talk some sense into them. Like recommending the bottle. - Somehow that's cheating. - What? The bottle. How? Removing you from it all. Might make you slightly patronizing to the boys who are not afraid to get involved. I'm sorry. Barbara. Yes. I don't.. I don't love you. I know. And I don't want to marry you. But I.. Oh, my darling. 'Our neighbor across the street' says that decorating Christmas trees is a nasty German custom and she's not gonna do it this year. Her contribution to the war effort. Well, ready for the lights. Oh, Anne, we're gonna light the tree. - 'Coming.' - Would you get the light? Oh, how lovely. Ooh, see the pretty tree. See that? Oh, do you remember? Father always said something at this moment. You do it, Anne. God rest all the men who fought for us all over the world. God rest the Americans who were with us 'and the nice ones who've been to our house.' Dick and...John. Evelyn, uh, should we include Max Murphy? No, he was a drip. Tommy will be home soon. And God rest all those that have gone. Mother, dad.. Kid.. Dick.. And Mark. 'And may the war end quickly' and may everyone come home. Well, that's all in this. May I make a wish for your son? Please do. Well.. I just hope that when all this is over we'll have a world where.. ...where he can grow up and grow old. 'Where he can become, well, a fine boy..' ...a husband, father, grandfather. Whatever else he wants to become. Did you hear that? You're going to become a grandfather. 'It's almost midnight now.' and Christmas starts around here at dawn. You could sleep here. Kid used to bunk out here. And once in a while Dick Bates. Take a look at the view. Remember, Barbara, we'd lie here and look out.. ...and you'd tell me things. Yes, I remember. So, it's all set up. You'll stay? I'm afraid not, Evelyn. I have to report back to the base tonight. Oh, gosh. Oh, I've gotta help Anne. She's absolutely no good at changing nappies. Instead of teaching her all about Oklahoma you should have taught her how to change a baby. 'Night.' The reason I can't stay tonight is I'm not gonna be here tomorrow. Oh! I'm sailing. Shoving off. Some battleship admiral took a look at what he had coming to him in the way of his staff. Discovered he raided a marine major and didn't have one-- - Whereabouts, do you know? - I don't know. Up north of here around Ulithi I guess. I'm really not very happy about it. I'm not a sea-going marine sitting around doing staff duty. It'll be better than investigating prospective brides. Maybe. Thank you for my lighter. Merry Christmas. Happy New Year. I wish I had stuck to my bottle. Do you? Really? I don't know. I, I know what you mean but these have been nice months. I think we've both been.. ...a little less lonely. That's for sure. You know, this may sound funny to you, but.. ...you're the first girl that I ever really liked. Well, that's nice. It means a lot more than it sounds. I know. I don't know. Just...hanging around the house.. ...watching you and your sisters just living.. Well, it's a way that I never got to know a girl before. And you leave a wiser and no sadder man. Wiser, yeah. No sadder? I don't know where I'm going. I don't know what's gonna happen. I suppose, sooner or later we're gonna have to land on the Jap mainland.. Well, if that happens, it'll make Guadalcanal and Tarawa and the rest of them look like kid stuff. But, at least.. ...it won't be like with the others. You worrying whether I'm dead or me lying in a ditch full of guilt. - That's something. - It is. And we've had a good time. Wonderful. I guess you must've thought it strange the times that I.. ...times that I.. ...I told you how wonderful it was just to hold you.. ...and to have you hold me and nothing more. Some people couldn't understand that. I do. It's funny. It is. Well.. When I know where I'm going, I'll write. I'll write too. There's Tommy. Look, he's grown a mustache. Oh, that's not such a tragedy. I've never kissed a man with a mustache before. Well, maybe he'll shave it off for you. It's good to have it over with, isn't it? I mean, our part of it. I know you're thinking about Okinawa, Barb-- Oh, it's good. You be happy. Go on. Go on about Italy, Tommy. Go on about Italy. Evelyn, for a week you've done nothing but ask Tommy questions. Well, I could've been interested in a big batch of these scones. - Did you like the socks? - They were great. Only, I'll never wear another knitted thing in my life. I was wondering if I might have a few words with you, if I may? Oh, of course, Tommy. Um, Evelyn, why don't you go and make some fresh tea? - Oh, Barbara, I'd-- - Come on. What is it, Tommy? Well, I.. I-I've got a good job promised to me in Oakland after my leave. And I've, I've managed to save up some from my army pay.. Well...well, I love Evelyn. Oh, Tommy. You don't need to ask. The government is offering all returned men temporary passes on trains and planes. They want us to, to see the land we were fighting for. Wives can get along, so.. I saw the bloke and he said it'd be alright if Evelyn went along. We'd, we'd end up in Oakland and.. ...we'd be married at my uncle's place up there. Of course, you can go. When do you plan to leave? Oh, Barbara, I knew you'd say yes. We'll have to get you all done up a proper bride. Oh, Tommy. If only you knew how lonesome I've been. Oh, yes. With all those Yanks around. They didn't make any impression on me. 'The casualties continue to mount at Okinawa.' 'The heaviest toll thus far, has been among the destroyers' 'on picket duty off the northern end of the island.' 'And that's the end of the news from London.' 'There is still no report on the actual effects' 'of the atom bomb on the city of Hiroshima.' 'An impenetrable cloud still hangs over the city.' - Yes? - Miss Anne Leslie, please. - I'm Anne Leslie. - 'What is it, Anne?' I've been instructed to give you these funds. Five hundred pounds and this cable. 'And that is the end of the news from London.' "Beloved daughter, come home at once. Bring child. Funds with this cable. Mother." But, I-I don't understand. Darling, I wrote to Mrs. Bates. What? You know the notices in the paper. You've seen them. But you didn't mention it to me. Uh, if you would sign for the funds, please. Go ahead. Perhaps you will care to verify the amount. No. It's okay. Uh, if the bank can be of any further assistance.. Thank you. Thank you very much. Barbara. Barbara, should I? - Well, of course you should. - But there's you and De. I know. But Shiner will be home soon. They'll find him in a prison camp and they'll live with me. Oh! - Miss Anne Leslie? - Oh! United States Marines, at your service. What is it? We received the following cable from the American Embassy. "Representative Webson, Oklahoma "demands immediate passage, states Anne Leslie and son, Christchurch, expedite." I'm here to expedite. The Americans. Expedite. I trust that was expeditious enough for the congressman. You've been very kind. Thank you. It was my pleasure, ma'am. It was nice of you to fly down to see Anne off. I didn't come just for that, Barbara. Shiner gets in tonight. Tonight? Barbara, would you do me a favor? Let Shiner and me have the cottage alone for a day or so. It's going to be difficult and I want to be alone. I'm going to ask him for a divorce. Now, don't lecture, Barbara. Don't lecture. De, you can't just wash away responsibilities like that. Barbara, I'm going to California. With Joe, if he gets back from Okinawa. Oh, De. I don't know, Shiner. I wouldn't know him if he came down the street. Well, 'course it will be hard. What about your fellow in Okinawa? If he return and ask you to marry him, you'll run off-- - I don't run off with Yanks. - Well, 10,000 girls did. And you'd be a fool not to. And you can, just like that. Because Mark was killed and you're free. Don't talk like that. But Shiner's alive and he's going to be here tonight. I want you to leave the cottage so that we can have this out alone. 'Ladies and gentlemen, the war is over.' 'Word has just been received' 'that the Japanese have offered to surrender.' 'I repeat. The war is over.' 'Word has just been received' 'that the Japanese have offered to surrender.' You know, I never would've recognized you, girl. I know. You said that. Would you have recognized your old Shiner? - No. - Alright, what you got to say? - What do you mean? - You got something to say. It's been hanging right there ever since I got in. What is it? We heard what went on down here. Are you going to tell me something like that? Are you? There's no other way of saying it, Shiner. - I don't love you anymore. - You never did. What difference does it make? You're mad at me because I was the only thing around in trousers. - Well, it was alright with me. - That's not true. If you're going to lie, shut up. If you're saying how you caught it on with Americans like your damn sisters, shut up. - I want a divorce. - No. Now come to bed. Shiner. - I'm going to get a divorce. - No. - It's been four years. - And how many Yanks? I'm going to marry one of them. The hell you are. Proceed. So then, your sister did confide in you. From time to time. Yes. Now, she went to Wellington in the early part of the war. 'Didn't she tell you why?' She told me she was going to get a job with the.. ...navy office there. She wanted to feel that she was helping the war effort. Directly, I mean. 'Mm-hmm. And you visited her on one occasion' 'in Wellington, you say?' 'To bid her word, I believe that her husband' 'was saving a prisoner of war.' 'Is that true?' 'Is that true?' 'The witness will please answer.' Oh, yes, yes. Was she happy to hear of her husband's safety? 'I asked, was she happy to learn of her husband's safety?' Oh, yes, very. We made plans that after the war Delia and her.. ...her husband would.. '...live at the cottage in Christchurch with us.' 'I see.' You'd say then that your sister was a happily married woman eagerly anticipating the return of her husband. Yes. She was a lovely girl. 'Thank you.' 'The hearing is about to resume.' Yes, I'm afraid public opinion will be biased, Barb. Are you gonna give evidence for Shiner? Barbara, I was ordered here from my ship to give evidence. - Barbara, please. - Please, what? - It's nothing to do with us. - It didn't happen in a vacuum. American supermen with more money than they've ever had before in their lives. Dazzling little girls who were lonely. It wasn't us. Now we kept it from being us. After they release me here, probably tonight they're gonna fly me up to Wellington. And then a ship home. Come with me. You're going in there and saying terrible things about Delia and then you expect me to pack my bag and follow you home. - Barbara-- - Why did you come here? Why did you all ever come? We came because there was a war. 'Major Harding, you mean to tell me that all New Zealand girls' who wanted to marry American servicemen were investigated? - That's right. - Why? - Well.. - Come on, major, speak up. Tell us why. Well, we didn't, that is, the government...didn't want.. Didn't want what? Didn't want people entering the country...who were.. 'Undesirable is the word you're looking for, isn't it, major?' - Yes. - Yes, undesirable. Your government did not want undesirables such as, shall we say, racketeers and gangsters. 'Now, of course, you wouldn't want' 'people like that in America.' 'Now, tell me, major, what kind of a woman' 'did you find Delia Friskett to be?' Attractive and intelligent. No, I mean morally. Well, since I didn't know she was married I judged her to be satisfactory. What did you think later? - I didn't think anything, sir. - Quite correct. It wasn't your job to think. But what did you report? 'Major, I said what did you report?' That, um...she was living with a lieutenant before she met the marine who wanted to marry her. - 'An American lieutenant?' - 'Yes.' 'Before that there was another American.' Yes. 'And another and another' 'and another.' - 'Yes.' - 'Speak up, major.' 'I said three anothers.' - 'Yes.' - Yes. Now, I'm gonna ask you, major how many Americans in all you reported Delia Friskett as having been intimate with? Seven. I really do apologize, major, but you must speak up. - Seven. - 'Thank you.' That is all, Your Honor. The court will adjourn until this afternoon at 2 o'clock. 'Here is the news.' 'The trial of Phil Friskett on a charge of murder' 'took a surprising turn this morning.' 'An American officer took the stand to disclose' 'the sensational nature..' Barbara after they release me here, probably tonight they're gonna fly me up to Wellington and then a ship home. Come with me. You're going in there and saying terrible things about Delia and then you expect me to pack my bag and follow you home. Why did you come here? Why did you all ever come? We came because there was a war. Is Major Harding staying here, please? Room 822. Thank you. Hello. You don't have to knock. Just walk right on in. - Major Harding's room? - It sure is. Come on in. Hey, look what I found. Wait a minute. - This is Major Campbell. - Hi. And this is Mrs. Campbell. Hello. This is Barbara. Oh! - Come on, Bob. - Barbara? That's right. Barbara. - Oh! Sure. - Come on, let's go. This is the hotel where I lectured Delia about running away with Americans. This is different. It's always different, isn't it? If my father could read the history of his daughters.. He'd understand. As they say, to understand is to forgive. Or is it, to understand is not to forgive? I can never remember.
