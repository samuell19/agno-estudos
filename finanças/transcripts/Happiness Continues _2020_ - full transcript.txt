[Kevin Jonas] The breakup needed to happen so that we could find ourselves as individuals, so we could come back and do this better. We were a group. We lost sight of who we were as people. So until we found that, we could never come back as a band. [Nick Jonas] When we got back together, it was about actually going in and reopening some of those wounds to properly heal them. ’Cause you can’t just slap another Band-Aid on it. You have to get in and see what’s really there. - [Crowd cheering faintly] - [Joe Jonas] We really healed. And we really have mended a broken relationship. And now, we’re better than we’ve ever been. It’s family. - [Crowd cheering] - ♪ City is small ♪ ♪ Can’t look up And see the stars ♪ ♪ Can’t look up And see the stars ♪ ♪ Seeing my name On that walk of fame ♪ - ♪ I been a king And I’m back ♪ - [siren wailing] ♪ Whoo! ♪ [Nick] I think every day is about choosing happiness.

Even the challenges that we present to each other. And having a better understanding now of what the mature version of us working together is. [Cheering continues] [Nick] You nervous at all about today? [Kevin] I don’t think I’m nervous. I’m just kind of excited. [Nick] The last month and a half that we had off, like, after the album came out-- Just taking the downtime, being away from each other a little bit is always good. Come back inspired and enthused and ready to go. And we don’t want to kill each other. Do you think anyone will come? Yeah, well? All right, uh, shall we get in the car? - [Laughing] Yeah. - Yes! Wow. - Wow! - It’s gorgeous. It’s stunning. [Band playing rock riffs] [Baz Halpin] Um, hey, Eric! Can you turn the Mozarts on? A little glow. - This is so great. - I love this. This is my favorite, man. I mean, this is where I would want to see anybody tour. Somehow we decided to build the Death Star out there. [Classical music playing] Everything is a curve. Everything is a bend. Everything is a ramp. Like, I think it needs to be a Vegas, like, showman moment where it’s like... ♪ Happiness begins ♪ [imitates rock riff] I think there’s literally like a... [imitates explosive rock riff] I can’t help but get in the crowd when I’m onstage. I usually jump off. I want to be part of it. I want to be with the people. We built the stage to cater to everything we love. [Laughing] That’s the magic surface here. It drops down. Oh, the stairs go down and then comes up. Can we do it once? I wanna do it. It’s powerful, but at the same time, for me, it’s a little bit like-- it’s, like, real boy band... shit. He can only see out of one eye. And he’s only got 50 % vision of that eye, - but he’s a good pyro guy. - That’s good to know. - Whoa! [Whooping] - So basically, it’s "Rollercoaster," "SOS," "Cool," "Only Human," "Strangers," "Way We Roll." I think you throw another new song in. "Every Single Time" or something. Or you can do, um, "Still In Love With Me" there. "Still In Love With You" there. Then you go to "Jealous," "Cake By The Ocean." [Nick] Well, when you look at it from this perspective, you kind of get the full scale of it. - [Joe] Yeah. - [Kevin] It’s overwhelming. - [Joe] It’s amazing. - [Kevin] Like, I just want to get here. I want to get in the venue. You are in the venue. I was lost for so long, not knowing, like, my identity. But now, I’m sitting here again. Just tell myself to just take a breath, chill and enjoy.

What? [Laughs] - [man] You know what we were watching today? - What were you watching? [Man] We were watching Bollywood hits. Of course you were watching Bollywood hits. - It was amazing. - It’s his hype music. [Man laughing] "That’s his hype music." Gets him lit. [Upbeat Bollywood music playing] [Priyanka] I didn’t do that. It was requested. I just want to be clear. [Man] Oh, yes! I try to clear my mind. I actually try to forget any of the things that could be holding anything back. I essentially try to... go into a meditation state. No, no, no, no, like a different style of mount in the back that will drop the TV without having to, like, rip anything off the wall. [Chattering, laughter] No! - [Chattering] - [woman] One person did, but... Alena, come here. Alena, don’t walk away. [Kids shouting indistinctly] I do a lot of things. Um... [rock music playing] [mouthing] [laughter] [Joe] A little preshow ritual. I do 20 push-ups. I stretch my arms out like this. - And I scream. - [Screaming] I usually, like, do a quick little sprint back and forth. [Both growling] I have somebody slap me in the face. [Both growling] For the last few shows, it’s been Kevin or Nick. They’re both very timid though. Like, I need a good slap. [Yelling] - [man] Let’s go! - Who wants it? - [Man] High energy! - [Kevin] Here we go. God, thank you for keeping everyone safe on this road and this journey. Let us stay safe on that stage. Let the voices be strong, instruments played well. Let’s have a great time. Jesus’ name, amen. - [All] Amen! - [Yelling, whooping] All right! This happiness begins... [all] Right now!

[Marching band playing] And I used to feel weird saying that, but then I spoke to a lot of fans and they were telling me, "It’s my first kiss song," my graduation song, my tenth birthday, like real-life stuff. [Kevin] When we talked about even doing a show, the first words out of my mouth to them was... "Do you think people will even care?" - We love you! - [Raucous cheering] The fans. I mean, they cannot, should not be overlooked in all this. They were loud enough online and other places for us to know, okay, there’s an appetite for it. My favorite Jonas brother is Nick. My favorite Jonas brother is Joe. My favorite one is Kevin. Kevin, I watched your show. You know what was cool last night? Leaving the venue after rehearsal and then notes and everything at 1:00 a.m. and seeing those fans there. Yeah. And not one of them was there just to get a picture. Actually, no one asked for one. And it was just like a cool conversation. They were like, "You guys should go get some rest. You got a big day tomorrow." - There was a real difference in the fans. - They’re like a support in it. It’s like, we’re here for you. Like, whatever you-- That’s-- I’m getting emotional again. It’s crazy. - Nick. - Joe. Me too. - Joe. - Nick. - You know it’s Nick. - Nick. You know it’s Nick. It’s Nick! - It’s Nick. - They’re all hot, though. - Nick. - I’m a Joe girl. - Kevin. - Joe. And I have to apologize because I followed him to a restaurant in Lima, Peru. You were with Sophie and I followed you to the bathroom. - You can’t pick a favorite. - Kevin! - Joe. - Kevin. - [Man] Kevin? - Kevin. Kevin, Kevin. Forever Kevin. - Nick. - Nick. Nick también. Pero Kevin. - Joe. - Nick. Favorite brother? Kevin. - [Cheering, whooping] - Kevin, right? Kevin! I love the Bonus Jonas, so I just wanna say Frankie. [Man] Who’s your favorite Jonas brother? Ooh. Myself. [Laughing] Yeah. The truth comes out. Joe. King in the North. I love you. - Nick. Nick. - [Both laughing] Nick! Nick... [speaks native language] Certainly we felt like, okay, if we do this, there’s at least some people that would care. Fans. - Let’s go... - Say hello? - What’s up? - [Fans whooping] - Who’s pumped? - Hey, what’s up? - You made it. - [Fans] We did! - Yeah, nice. - What’s up, guys? How are you? - [Laughter] - Nicole? Good to meet you. [Chattering] [Kevin] It’s gonna be emotional for the fans that were there when we were playing the parking lot in front of the Dick’s Sporting Goods here in New York.

[Blows raspberry] We didn’t understand who each other were anymore and we weren’t friends. I was like, if we’re gonna be a band, we gotta all contribute to the creative process. Or we don’t, and that’s a rule that it’s okay to do that. We didn’t treat each other like equals. Nick’s running the show. When that happens, then I’m more inclined to not give a shit. There has to be some structure, and that’s me. There has to be some. You know, I asked Joe and Nick why they left me out of a show. Multiple shows. And Kevin has this incredible ability on this side to just connect. He connects all the dots between the three of us. You know, like, that’s a hard thing to confront someone about when it’s been years of billowing underneath the surface. There has to be some element of things being loose and free and exciting, and that’s Joe. Felt like at times I was last to know things. We started to prioritize the band over our relationship as brothers. For Joe, it was a lot of things, about, you know, me not controlling the process, Kevin being present. We started as these three kids from New Jersey who loved playing music together. And then it turned into, like, us bored, annoyed, jaded. The times where Kevin felt like he couldn’t be himself and live his life and we weren’t proud of him and his family because we were so focused on the band. Which is true. We didn’t understand that they could all coexist and actually make your life better. For the first time since we were kids, we’re now on the same plane when it comes to our relationships. Uh, we’re each individually married and have similarity again. So we each have a role. And without all those pieces, it doesn’t quite work the same way. I think it’s kind of poetic that Nick was the one that hung up the phone, but he’s also the one that picked it back up. He was the one that said, "Hey, I miss you guys onstage. I want to do this with you again." I thought I was done with the Jonas Brothers.

It was a really crazy moment in our lives and... while so much good was happening, I don’t think I had the emotional maturity yet to know how to process the moments that were very challenging. And I actually played that song at this venue for the first time for my dad and my brothers. It was actually a shower ’cause the acoustics are so good in the showers. But as I’m in this room, I think about, like, how much time has passed. I was, uh, 14 when I wrote that one. But I think I like that it didn’t take itself too seriously and it was... you know, making love an object of some kind. Or like a thing. Which then was an easier way to make it make sense in my brain at 14 than getting too deep about it. [Playing intro to "Lovebug"] When I start playing it, I start thinking about... how amazing that would be to play live and just to start the song like that, and people know immediately what it is and connect with it. - [Intro to "Lovebug" playing] - [crowd cheering] - [stops playing] - And then I tease them a bit. - [Resumes playing "Lovebug"] - Keep going. - [Intro to "Lovebug" continues] - [cheering] ♪ Called you For the first time yesterday ♪ ♪ Finally found The missing part of me ♪ ♪ Felt so close But you were far away ♪ ♪ Left me Without anything to say ♪ ♪ Now I’m speechless ♪ ♪ Over the edge I’m just breathless ♪ ♪ I never thought That I’d catch this ♪ ♪ Lovebug again ♪ ♪ Hopeless, head over heels In the moment ♪ ♪ I never thought That I’d get hit ♪ ♪ By this lovebug again ♪ ♪ I kissed her For the first time yesterday ♪ ♪ Everything I wished That it would be ♪ ♪ Suddenly I forgot How to speak ♪ ♪ Hopeless, breathless ♪ ♪ Baby, can’t you see? ♪ [Music swells] ♪ Now I’m ♪ [guitar solo] ♪ Yeah, oh! ♪ ♪ Now I’m speechless ♪ ♪ Over the edge I’m just breathless ♪ ♪ I never thought That I’d catch this ♪ ♪ Lovebug again ♪ ♪ Now I’m hopeless ♪ ♪ Head over heels In the moment ♪ ♪ I never thought That I’d get hit ♪ ♪ By this lovebug again ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Lovebug ♪ [cheering] ♪ Again ♪ [Nick] It started in such a simple way. [Song ends] Those are the ones that I think will always connect the best. We got here early just, and like, there’s so many shows that... we’re late and everything’s rushed and I have so much anxiety. - And then today, we’re-- - [woman] You should be so calm today. Today, it’s almost eerily calm. Do you want us to cheat and make it a little shorter because you have the guitar? Like, is it getting in the way of your playing? What you do to those girls-- And boys. [Woman] And boys. And boys, is what, like, Bette Midler does to me. [Woman laughing] Fashion plays a big role, I think, in all of our lives. - Right - Um... Some of us do it better than others. Obviously. - Do you want to do low tops with this? - [Kevin] Yeah. - Okay. - And I also wanna do no shirt. Oh, my God, yes. Give them life. I’m just kidding. Uh, this jacket doesn’t need shit. [Soft orchestral music playing] [crowd chanting] Jonas! Jonas! Jonas! [Chanting fades] [Kevin] Every night before I go to bed and I’m away from my family... the only thing I’m thinking about is... the moments where they’re a part of this world. I didn’t know my identity. But they gave me such incredible empowerment and love and purpose that it didn’t matter what happened with the Jonas Brothers ever again because I knew that if it happened, great. But it wouldn’t matter unless they were by my side. I never thought this would happen again. [Cheering] This just proves dreams really do come true. [Cheering] Thank you for waiting.

I can see in the audience when it’s definitely... those other people’s songs. I see couples holding each other. I see somebody, that song got them through something.

[Kevin] If I’m gonna do a tour, it’s gotta work for me too. You know, I’m not gonna miss the first day of school. Like, I’m gonna be there to bring her to her first day of school. I’m gonna make it happen. - [Alena] Hey, Mommy’s here! - [Barking] [Danielle] Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo. [Kevin] Did you know why this venue’s important to Daddy? - [Alena] Why? - Because this was one of our first sold-out shows ever in our career. It was at this place about 11 years ago. Ten years ago. [Kevin] It’s a different dynamic, but it’s a fun one. And I think that that’s what’s so cool. Everyone’s celebrating each other’s individuality. [Playing soft melody] [Nick] The inspiration for this album came from a lot of different places. I think the biggest was the excitement of getting back in the studio and creating something that was a combination of all that Joe did with DNCE and his development as an artist over that time and where I came from with my solo stuff and doing something that connected all those dots. Ah. [Clears throat] [sniffling] Yeah. ♪ Just please say yes ♪ ♪ Please... ♪ It’s, um, surprisingly challenging. ♪ Just please say yes ♪ ♪ Please say yes ♪ - You got it? - [Man] I think so.

Any other artists that are doing two days of vocals and day-of-show vocals for their MSG shows? No. It’s a big move. It’s not really a thing that I think a lot of people are doing. You’ll be very warmed up. Sing a bunch more, and then, uh, go sing tonight. - Yeah, exactly. - Yeah. [Singers vocalizing] [Joe] I’m a stage junkie, man. I love it. The only reason I would want to... [laughs] ...run on a treadmill ever is because I want to be able to sing and move. I never want to be standing still on that stage. I looked at Nick yesterday at rehearsals and he was, like, "All right, tomorrow we’re gonna work on where everyone’s gonna move." I’m like, look, man, like, you know how it’s gonna go. Let’s pick a moment where we all go forward so we don’t catch on fire or whatever. But, like, I can’t stand still naturally.

I think it’s only fair that we do something special for Chicago. [Cheering] There’s gonna be a number up on the screen, okay? I want you all to text that number right now. [Kevin] Chicago was cool because we got off that stage and we’d played a bunch of shows at this point, and we felt like now we’re kind of in the groove. I think it was Joe. He was like, "We should play a club show here." Uh, Joe, you nervous about playing with John and Greg again? With a lesser musician. You nervous about playing with a-- I’m more nervous about remembering lyrics to songs that I haven’t played in so long. [Siren wailing] [Kevin] Ironically, the only place that we could find was a spot that we had played on a tour, like, 12 years prior. [Loud cheering] [Joe] We played most of the songs we played back at that same venue so long ago. The energy in that place was amazing and sweaty and brought me back to these shitty rock and roll venues we used to play. - Oh. - My legs. Come on, man. - We made it. - Oh, there’s beer? ♪ Don’t complicate it ’Cause I know you ♪ - ♪ And you know everything About me ♪ - That’s what it is, yeah. - You have to kill all of these. - We’re learning songs.

The first time I’m ever gonna play it. I played it. I covered it. So, go like this... [whistling melody] [vocalizing] [cheering] Whoo! It really does feel like I’m kind of dreaming right now. This could be 2006. I don’t know. Should we do this thing? - [Laughter] - Cheer... Hey. - To getting the band back together. - That’s right. - That’s right. - "The One Where They Got the Band Back Together." It’s probably sloppy and it’s very sweaty, but that’s what it’s about. That’s why we do what we do because we love this so much. We don’t need all that production. We can strip it all back right now and say, like, "Let’s just play." And it’s just three brothers loving playing music together. [Cheering] So there’s something really cool about going from a room of, like, 16,000, 17,000 people... to a room that only fits, like, 200. [Cheering] We played this venue on February 9, 2006. [Cheering] This is the original Jonas Brothers band onstage right here. - [Cheering] - As you can see, Greg Garbowsky. [Cheering] John Taylor. - [Raucous cheering] - [Nick speaks indistinctly] We have not played these songs with them in, uh, seven or eight years. So please have some grace. You guys ready?

It went so far as they didn’t tell anyone. So we got on an airplane and flew to Philadelphia. And when we landed in Philadelphia to go to baggage claim to get our bags to go to the gig for the show the next day, uh, I got a phone call that said, "The tour is canceled. The band is breaking up." - [Audience singing] - There it is. [Greg] It was sad. I mean, I was working at a store in downtown LA. I remember one time, I was sweeping up and they were playing "Superstition," Stevie Wonder, and I’m sweeping, and I remember thinking, I played this song on the Grammys with him and the Jonas Brothers. And it was kind of a sad moment. ♪ Happy as can be ♪ ♪ Just gotta Be, be good to me ♪ ♪ Baby ♪ [quiet instrumental interlude] Who remembers the talking bit? [Fan] I want to kiss you!

Thank you so much for coming out tonight. [Joe] Thank you, everybody! [Joe] We started out playing music in our garage and we went to go play those venues with not even half the crowd in that room. It’s so important to remind yourself of where you came from. We actually went back in the car and we were like, "Anybody else wanna, like, hang out?" [Chuckles] We should, like, go back to that shitty dressing room. - [Chattering] - [clapping] It’s not, like, "Oh, this is so foreign." Like, this is actually who we are. What’s the spot that we played on-- You’ll know. The spot we played on Super-- - The Middle East. - No, Super Bowl Sunday. And no one came to the show. That’s not even a bar. That was a trailer. - [All laugh] - [Nick] That was in Columbus, Ohio. Columbus, Ohio. That’s where it was. Super Bowl Sunday. The year that the Steelers won. - No, no. That was Missouri. - It was Missouri. - No, no. - It was Missouri. - It wasn’t? Am I wrong? - It was Columbus, Ohio. There were two other guys trying to watch the Super Bowl who were like, "Shut the fuck up!" In between every song. The only place that we could find to rehearse was a chicken restaurant. Our show at Jones Beach when we played The Click Five’s gear was probably the worst show I’ve ever played in my whole-- I forgot my guitar in the green room. It was terrible. [Woman] We’ve seen them, like, a total of - 14 times. - Fourteen times, yeah. This is Carly and Nick when she saw them in New York. [Both laughing] So here’s me with his nice tushy. We need to find more pictures. Here’s me and Paul Jonas. I love Garbo. And this is a sign that we made for Kevin when he got engaged. This is a sign that we made for Joe. This is my mom with a picture of Nick Jonas. [Laughing] [lively chatter] [Nick] Lately, I was just feeling nostalgic and, like, remembering the songs. - It was very fun for me. - I had a really good time. [Laughing] Yeah, I had a great time. Even as simple as sweating. Like, really sweating during a show. The big shows, it’s hard to really differentiate what you’re playing. When we play somewhere like this, I can remember everybody’s face in that crowd tonight. It was the most fun I’ve had in seven years. [Nick] I think that for every performer... there’s a deep-seated thing, I don’t know what you want to call it, a gut feeling within you that says that you can do anything with that support. You know, like, you could fly. Every show, you want to talk about it, be around friends, celebrate. [Kevin] It comes through your feet. That’s the thing, though. People are like, "Oh, it’s just loud. You’re just hearing screams." No, you feel the energy in your legs. [Nick] That passion, that electric energy fuels you in a way that’s just indescribable. [Nick] My biggest lesson early on was just not being over-excited with it, because then I would not sing well. But now, harnessing it and using it as something to propel you. If you do, it’s an unforgettable life to be a performer.

I don’t go to college. ♪ We weren’t meant ♪ ♪ To get out of Jersey... ♪ [Kevin] I’m in a band, I do the thing, and now our trajectory is just up. The Jonas Brothers become what the Jonas Brothers became and my life was this insanity for ten years, till I was 26. You know, that’s what’s crazy. I did this for 12 years with my brothers. It’s all I knew. And then it’s over in a single conversation. - [Man] Oh, yeah. Yeah. - [Guitar picking] You don’t know who you are anymore. During the years, I kind of threw, you know, darts at the wall. You know, I went into the app business, I went into some real estate stuff. So I just kind of focused my energy in that space for work. But really, I spent so much time at home with my kids and my family and my wife and really enjoying having newborns and seeing them grow and try to make every day special. [Crowd cheering faintly] [birds chirping] [Kevin] During the years that we were apart, the fracture hit me a lot harder than I think I ever expected. I, you know, put on a brave face, saw the guys being successful and was happy for them. But it wasn’t always easy to watch. You grow to be okay with it, but then the minute it came back around, it felt right. I feel like I have something to prove. I’ve been out of the game for five years. People haven’t seen me, you know, perform, they haven’t seen me sing, they haven’t seen me play guitar. So when I step out on that stage, it’s pretty much like... "I’m back. Let’s go."

[Band playing upbeat instrumental] [playing guitar solo] - [music ends with flourish] - [cheering] - Oh, my God. - [Whooping] [crowd cheering] Holy shit! [Whooping] [Joe] You see bands break up all the time. - Oh, my fucking gosh! - Yeah! - [Whooping] - Oh, my God! [Joe] And every once in a while you hear about a band of brothers breaking up, but, like, I want us to get better as brothers every year and hopefully help mend some broken families out there through our story. Oh, my God. How did we unlock this level? [Laughing] [Kevin] When we stepped on the stage for the first time together... I think, emotionally, it was more than I even knew that I could handle. [Cheering and applause] [Kevin] I think our parents were proud of us. And it’s now gonna be where I’m proud that I’m doing it for my kids and they’re proud that their dad is. So it’s still a family dynamic. It’s, like, so built into our core. - Everybody! That was amazing. - [Cheering] Let’s do it another 82 more times. Yes! [Laughter, cheering] - And let’s go have a drink, everybody. - [Cheering] - We’re out of here. - [Indistinct chatter] - It’s a hundred-- - Sorry, hundred times! [Laughter] [Priyanka] Trust Nick to correct you. [Laughter] [Nick] We had our tough, tough conversations while making the documentary. We said some real shit. And now I think it’s just like, we have the ability to just hash it out, talk it through. It’s that simple. Our dad always said... as long as your kids call him Uncle Joe... and him Uncle Kevin... nothing else matters. I hope that we mean something to people. You know? That it’s bigger than the music. That it’s bigger than a hit or a song on the radio or a sold-out tour. But that when it’s all said and done... that we meant something to people, that they felt connected to us and that we made them proud. Somehow I feel like, with us, there’s this energy of, we’re kind of their boys in a way. Which feels good. We own that. We love it. We just want to make them proud. ♪ Yeah, ooh-la-la ♪ ♪ By the pool We’re singing "Bailando" ♪ ♪ Turned down lights With a view, yeah ♪ ♪ Keeping those blinds closed Yeah ♪ ♪ She said, "I wanna find Somebody by nightfall" ♪ ♪ Ooh-na-na, could it be Yeah, baby, I like you ♪ ♪ Oh, watching her move I was lost in the rhythms ♪ ♪ And she pulled me close By the look in her eyes ♪ ♪ Don’t know her name But I know that I need her ♪ ♪ She said, "No, you won’t be Lonely tonight" ♪ ♪ She said, "Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Kiss me like your ex Is in the roo-oo-oom ♪ ♪ Don’t you be afraid Of something new ♪ ♪ If you play it right You can be that someone ♪ ♪ Yeah, that someone who Won’t leave me Lonely tonight" ♪ ♪ Yeah-yeah-yeah Yeah-yeah-yeah ♪ ♪ Yeah, ooh-la-la Make a move Yeah, baby, by last call ♪ ♪ Full moon night With the lights off ♪ ♪ Baby, your eyes glow, yeah ♪ ♪ Don’t know why But I feel like ♪ - ♪ I’m-a go psycho ♪ - ♪ Psycho ♪ ♪ Ooh-la-la, if it’s cool Yeah, baby, I’d like to ♪ ♪ Oh, watching her move I was lost in the rhythms ♪ ♪ And she pulled me close By the look in her eyes ♪ ♪ Don’t know her name But I know that I need her ♪ ♪ She said, "No, you won’t be Lonely tonight" ♪ - ♪ She said, "Ooh, ooh, ooh" ♪ - ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ "Kiss me like your ex is ♪ - ♪ In the roo-oo-oom" ♪ - ♪ Roo-oo-oom ♪ ♪ "Don’t you be afraid Of something new ♪ ♪ If you play it right You can be that someone ♪ ♪ Yeah, that someone who Won’t leave me Lonely tonight" ♪ [woman singing in Spanish] - ♪ She said, "Ooh, ooh, ooh" ♪ - ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ "Kiss me like your ex is ♪ - ♪ In the roo-oo-oom" ♪ - ♪ Roo-oo-oom ♪ ♪ "Don’t you be afraid Of something new ♪ ♪ If you play it right You can be that someone ♪ ♪ Yeah, that someone who Won’t leave me Lonely tonight" ♪ - ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ - ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Tonight ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Someone who ♪ ♪ You won’t be lonely Tonight ♪ [song ends] [instrumental music] [music fades]
