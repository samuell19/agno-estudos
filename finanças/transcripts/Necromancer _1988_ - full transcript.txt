Remember, you asked for my help. I don't care anymore what I agreed to. I just want you to stop hurting him. And have you forgotten so soon how you were wronged by this man? No, but I want you to stop. I'll give you more money. I've already been paid satisfactorily. Why don't we go inside and talk about it? Okay, but my mind's already made up. Whatever it is you do in here, I want you to stop. Does your husband Matthew know you're here? Are you kidding? And does anyone else know you're here? I'd be afraid my friends would laugh at me. Quite. Look, please, I just want you to stop! It's too late! What? No! No, why? No! Hello, Ernest. J locked in my heart j surrender to all this passion j heals that you trust what's in your heart j feel the power j oh, baby, I've been caught on the wire j oh, you fight fire with fire j no, no escape from the fire j it's the call of the wild J tonight you'll sleep j tomorrow you won't remember j I'll be a shadow from the night j feel the power j yeah, baby, I've been caught on the wire j oh, you fight fire with fire j no, no escape from the fire j oh, oh j the call of the wild boo! Charles. Professor delonge at school, remember? Ah, you're angry, huh? - Alittle. - Alittle? A lot! You're a lot angry, I want you to be very, very angry, okay? You don't understand. I got good news for ya. Last night, I decided to cast you as Kate in taming of the shrew. - Really? - Yeah. But, I mean, Kate is a very angry young lady, so you've got to be able to bring that out of you. You can't just hold it all in, okay? Do you think I can do it? I wouldn't have cast you in the part if I didn't think you could do it, I mean, you've done all these little fluff parts and uh, well you've done a couple of dramas that you've been excellent in and now is the time to stretch out, but you gotta bring that out of you. And listen, why don't you come by my place tomorrow night and we'll go through it, huh? I'll give you some shakespearean breathing exercises and uh- - I don't think that's a good idea, Charles. Well, I'll just have to go home by myself then, and go to sleep. To die, to sleep, no more. Ah, to sleep. Perchance to dream. Ah, there's the rub, for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil? Must give us pause, menopause. Santa claus. Some things never change. All right, listen. We'll go over your character tomorrow in class, okay? - Okay. - All right. Goodnight. - Bye. Security! Key. Radical. Masks. Ready? Let's do it. Let's go. Stay here! Keep your eyes open for the campus cops. Why me? Why can't he do it? Just shut up and do it! Come on. Shh, shh! This way. Check the desk. Shh! Ah, all done. No problem. Paul. Can't get any easier than this. Got the test. Excellent. Give me the camera. Let's see what else we've got in here. Eric, you know I'd like to spend the night in your dorm, but we can't take another chance. What's this? Put this back. Check this letter out. Julie, that chick in the office? She's banging professor delonge. "Dear Charles. I think about you late at night while I lay in bed. The passion of last night stays fresh." Oh, this is beautiful. I wouldn't mind doin' her myself. If we got caught, you'd lose your scholarship and so would I. Look, why don't we just meet for a cup of coffee and talk or something, huh? Okay, I'll pick you up in 15 minutes? Okay? See ya later. I'm on my way. Bye. Get down! Let's bail. Come on! Allan? Allan, the building is closed. What're you doing here? Uh... Nothing. Well, you better get outta here before a security guard sees you and you get in trouble. No one's getting in trouble. Get your hands off me, Carl! What is going on here, Paul? Nothing. Just a prank. I'm calling the security guard. No, please. What do you want? "Dear Charles. When I lay in bed at night, my thoughts are of you." Where did you get that? What's the difference? Now I got you. Shut up! Scream again and I'll cut you. Why are you doing this, Paul? Why are you doing this? Hey, what're you gonna do, man? Now we're gonna have some real fun. Stop it! I'm not into it, Paul. Just hold her down! Don't let him do it! Please, don't let- don't move! I will cut you. You got a problem, man? - Stop! Please make him- - You shut up! Shut up! On our first date, you wouldn't even let me kiss you! It's all right, come on! Come on! - Oh, my god! - Shut up. "To become a witch, you must have a natural inclination to worship the old gods. It must be a feeling which Springs from the heart and carries you on towards your goal in exactly the same way it happened to the first witches thousands of years ago." Oh, listen to this. "Swm exec." What's swm? Single white male. "Late 30s, looking for female in her 20s. Must dig whips, chains, and trampolines. Also looking for couples to videotape orgies on the roof of my rv. Contact happy, box 13-13." That's sick. We gotta talk about what happened last night. Not here. I don't know how you guys can listen to that garbage. I mean, it's really disgusting. All right, I'll think of it as research for my sociology class. You dropped sociology. Okay, well I'll think of it as history! How can people's weird sexual fantasies have anything to do with history? If people didn't live out their sexual fantasies there wouldn't be any history. Makes sense to me. Come on, read some more. Julie, what's the matter? Did you and Eric have a fight last night? Well, what is it? Julie, what? I've been raped. What? I've been raped. Oh, my god. When? Last night. Where? At the theater. It was Paul dushane and Carl caulder. Did you tell the police? Why? - I can't. - Why? They found an old letter I wrote to Charles. Eric doesn't know anything about that. He won't understand. If Eric really loves you, it won't make any difference. You have to tell the police. You can't let them get away with this. I'm afraid. You can't let them go on like nothing happened. People like Paul and Carl think that they're above the law. They'll do it again. You have to report it. If not for yourself, then at least to keep it from happening again. Oh, Julie. I'm sorry. Julie, before you say anything. Look, I know what happened last night. Who told you? I know she's telling him everything, man. Carl, it's three people's word against one. There's a law about that and the law will protect us. We broke the law. Hey, hang with me on this one, man. It takes a lot of courage to keep your life exciting. To dare to be different. What if she tells somebody? No insecure bitch can touch us, 'cause we matter. She's just a chick. Am I right? I hope you're right. Count on it. And I know one thing for sure. I think you think that music's the only thing that matters to me in my life, but you're wrong. You matter to me. Eric, listen. Look, Julie, when you didn't show up last night, I got really mad. Eric. Something happened last night. I know, I know pushing you to spend the night with me in the dorm made you upset, I understand that. But you didn't have to blow me off to teach me a lesson. I didn't blow you off. - Okay. - That isn't what happened. Okay, so you just fell asleep and from your point of view, it seems like all I seem to think about is sex. Can you blame me? I mean, it beats the hell out of studying. Anyway, what I wanna try to tell you is that I think from these music gigs I'm starting to make enough money to where I can afford to get us a place off campus. Just you and me. Eric. Just think about it. Eric, there's something else we have to talk about. Julie, I love you. You know that. There's nothing to worry about. - Hi, Freda, how you doin'? - Good, thanks. Julie! What happened with Eric? What'd he say? Nothing. He thinks I shined him on last night 'cause I was mad. - You didn't tell him? - I tried. He just, he thinks I'm so damn perfect. I don't know what to do. Well, I do. I don't know if it'll work or anything, and you'll probably think I'm crazy. - What? - Come on. Trust me? Yeah, this is the right place. 1113. It doesn't look like anybody's home. Come on, this is it. Now that we're here, I'm kinda curious myself. Okay, are you gonna tell me now? What are we doing? Trust me. Shouldn't we at least knock first? Look, when I called, the lady told me just to come around to the back of the house. Don't worry, she's probably some old hippy who took too many acid trips or something. - Who? Come around here inside the gate where I can see you. I was beginning to think you weren't coming. We got a little lost, I'm not- my name is Lisa. - Uh, Freda and this is- - Julie? My fee is $20. Payable after the session. And only if you are satisfied, okay? Whatever happens inside this room will only help to release the anger within you. Anger, I might add, which is more than justifiable. The people who lived here before me left in rather a hurry, so I inherited some of their things. Julie, come stand within the circle with me, and hold my hand. Freda, stay outside of the circle. Now, Julie, I warn you, whatever happens, do not let go of my hand, and Freda, no matter what you hear or see, do not enter the circle. Now, before I call upon the spirits of darkness, I must ask you once again. Is this what you really want? If it is, say yes, three times. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes! So be it, then. Spirits of darkness, we call upon thee. We call upon the legions of the desolate one. He who has many names and many shapes. The lord of doom, king of darkness. He who was once called belial. The one who rules the world of vengeance and anger. We call thee now! We disturb thy kingdom. The domain of the unholy one. The one who was outcast as unclean and vile! More vile than the bowels of deva! We ask thee now to heed our position! Help us now! Send forth thy angel of vengeance! Stop! Let's stop, please! Look, I don't know what's goin' on, but let's get the hell out of here. - Where the hell did she go? - 1 don't know. Let's just get outta here. Can you believe that? I mean, did you see what I saw? I guess. I mean, it's kinda creepy. Where did she go anyway? I don't know. Was kind of elaborate though, I mean, all those lights. What was that red thing at the end? Who knows? Probably the bowels of deva. You are so gross sometimes. Wait, no. No, Julie, it had to be the demon of vengeance. No one else was invited. "Send forth thy demon of vengeance. More horrible than the bowels of deva." If you agree, say yes, three times. Oh, yes, yes, yes! Oh, spirit of the unholy one. Unholy one. We call upon thee now. We disturb thy kingdom. I want to meet the demon of vengeance. I could use a date. Hey, you maniacs! This is trapper. They're gonna turn you around. J places remind me of faces behind me j and you look like someone I know j but she just abused me, only to use me then go j there's something about you I feel of all places. Why did this party have to be at Paul's house? Julie, are you sure you wanna do this? I have to. I promised Eric I'd come and hear his band play. Okay. Here we go. J turn around j look in my eyes j and see the look of love you can't disguise j oh j please turn around j please don't reject me or leave and neglect me j I've got a few questions for you are you ready? For what? You won't believe this, come on. Believe what? It's okay, Julie, you can come too. - Go on, I'll be fine. - Are you sure? Yeah, go ahead. Come on. J there's something in your eyes you can't conceal j looking right through me I met this really neat guy today from one of those singles ads. J turn around j look in my eyes j and see the look of love you can't disguise j oh j please turn around j I look at you and I get strange vibrations j I hate to think I know the explanations j if you're who I think you are, the realizations are true j yeah Shut up! Hey, Julie. Hey, Julie. In here. Closet. Scream and I'll kill you. You're crazy. You like it that way. Now's your chance to get even, babe. Why are you doing this? Oh, my god. Do it or I'll cut you so bad nobody will ever wanna look at you again. No. Do it. Shoot me. No! Do it! Oh, my god. I shot him. Get a doctor. No, you haven't. We're just rehearsing her scene. Right, Julie? You really are sick. You havin' fun? J she was a playgirl with a neon smile Julie! Julie! What do you mean where have I been? Where you been? I've been talkin' to the band. Oh, the band? - Yeah. - What about me? Well, pay attention. Hey, Paul. - Hey, dude. - Hi. - Paul, we were gonna dance. - Okay, later, honey. - Okay. - What's goin' on? You're not gonna believe what I just did. - What? - This calls for a shot. - All right. - Come on, come on. Give me some of that. - Tequila. Paul, I gotta talk to you. What happened to Julie? Why'd she leave? - Who? Julie, my girlfriend! Why'd she take off? Well, maybe she didn't like your music. Look, pal, don't give me any of your jokes. I'm not your pal, I'm your employer, and I'm paying you to play, so play. You know what happened, and you're gonna tell me. - You don't wanna know. - Yes, I do! Okay, tough guy. She wanted to buy some blow but didn't have the cash, and she came onto me and I passed. You're a liar, she doesn't do drugs. Oh, really? She does a lot of things you don't know about. - Oh, yeah? - Hey! Pretty boy. Hey, if you hit me, I'm not gonna pay you or your band a dime! Don't hit me, man! Don't hit me! Turn that shit down! Gail's on the phone. Eat shit and die. Your music stinks. J she had me checking out her vital signs j all systems go, yeah we were flying just fine hello? What do you mean you can't come over? I just don't feel up to it, I'd rather be alone tonight. We had a date. Honey, I'll call you tomorrow. Of course I love you. Yeah, you love me. Yeah, right. Bitch. It's good, huh? Yeah. Jesus. What? Guess Paul was right about you. You bastard. I'm leaving. What? I just realized what's happening here. What're you talking about? You know exactly what I'm talking about. You made me lie to my boyfriend, just so you could use me. You're stoned. Come back to bed. You got what you wanted, but you're not getting any more outta me. What're you talkin' about? Where are you goin'? I'm gettin' outta here. Come back to bed, bitch. Don't touch me. Just stay away. Shit. Well, well. Look who's back for more. I always knew you wanted it. You're just like all the rest. This is gonna be fun. No! Paul? Paul? Paul? Paul? Julie? Did someone you know just get hurt? Who are you? My name is... Ernest. I know about her. She hurts people. The necromancer talks to the dead. Uses their spirits. Wait, I don't wanna hurt you. Then what do you want? Did you answer an ad in the paper? Do you know Paul dushane? No, is that who you're looking for? Did she hurt him? No. I don't know. Look, if you see him, tell him to find me. Wait, I don't know who he is. It was just a dream. She makes people disappear. I don't want you to get hurt too. Oh, Romeo, Romeo. Wherefore art thou, Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name. Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, and I'll no longer be a capulet. Okay, Jackie, that's fine. I think that's enough for today. Don't go away yet, though. Something I wanna talk to you about. Just a minute. Jackie, you're doing just fine. You really are, it's coming along, coming along. You seem a little uptight, though, a little nervous. Yeah, I didn't think so, but I saw in class, I saw a certain, like an innocence, you know? There's a great beauty that's in you, and I just, I wanna bring that out, especially in this part of Juliet. You seem to be all knots, look at this. Can I loosen this? Sure. In fact, you don't even need this here. Take that. Okay, let's just loosen these knots up. There. Now, do you feel better? - Yeah. Kickin' your shoes off at night, right? Okay, I want you to try something. Here, spread your legs a little bit. It's a breathing exercise. I want you to think of when you take a breath, don't do it until I tell you, but you take a deep breath, and let it come from right down up through your womb, and into your body, let it come right up, and right up into your breasts and up into your body, up into you head and then let it all come out of your mouth and that's what I want you to do when you think about Juliet, the part. I want that to come through you like that, all right? - Okay, all right. - Okay, now here. Okay, let all the air out. That's it, okay. And breathe in real slow. Real slow so I can feel it fill up. That's it. Deep. That's it, that's beautiful. That's coming along. And what that'll do is that'll take all the energy and bring it out, bring it out of you. So you'll dig deeper into yourself and it won't be just a bunch of words fallin' out, you know what I mean? Yeah. I have some, are you doing anything tomorrow night? - No, no. - Can you come over? - Yeah, sure, sure. - Great. Okay, I'll give you some exercises that'll really, really help you so that when you get on the stage, you won't be quite so tight, okay? - Great, thanks. - You're doing good, though. Just keep it up. All right, I'll see you tomorrow night, professor. Okay. Goodnight, Jackie. Charles? Julie. Have you, uh, been here long? No. Now look, if you came to talk to me about your part, the character, I'd just as soon do it in class, okay? So that all the students get the benefit. It's not about school. Julie, what's wrong? I'm here to warn you. Warn me? About what? The night before last, Carl caulder and Paul dushane raped me. What? Oh, my god. Julie. Oh, I'm so sorry, honey. You went to the police, didn't you? I'm going to, this morning. I don't know how but dushane got hold of a letter I wrote you. I was worried it would show up in the investigation and you'd lose your job. Well, uh, couldn't you just tell them it was, uh, it was a romantic fantasy? Look, say whatever you want. I'm sorry, Charles, if this has to involve you. Oh, no, no, no. No, no, you've gotta go to the police. Julie, it's... It's just that it's, well, it's a damn shame that, well, they'll probably revoke your scholarship. Why? Why would they do that? Well, I thought you knew, I mean, dushane's mother is on the school's board of trustees. Julie I'm so sorry, honey. But listen, don't worry about it. We'll think of something, okay? Okay. Okay, that's my girl. Okay. Eric? I gotta go. Eric, wait. Eric. Do you mind stopping? I would like to explain. I'm late for class! Look, what you saw isn't what it looked like. Professor delonge and I were just talking. That's all we were doing. - Is that what it was, huh? - Yes! - Atalk? - Yes! - Just talk? - Yes. About something that upset me. About something you don't know about. After what I saw last night, I'm sure there's a lot of things that you're doing that I don't know about. What does that mean? Eric. Eric, what does that mean? Look, you had me convinced you were some kind of angel, and I almost fell for it. Now I know how you get your straight as. Oh. Allan, I need a copy of that test. Where's dushane? I don't know. What did he do? Take off for Mexico again? "By astral light, by moonbeams bright. I charge the water clear. To turn the tide for Julie, the face reflected here. The moon will take away all strife, commence another phase. A mirrored surface, smooth as glass, will thus describe your days. With hope serene within your breast, forget all hurt and pain. Emerge from oceans newly born, and laugh at life again." Everybody, it's show time! If you'll all gather around, I'd like to let you know what's going on tonight. We're gonna start off... can I have some quiet, please? We're gonna start off tonight with Romeo's balcony speech. As soon as we finish that, we're gonna run the entire show from top to bottom, now it will be a stop-go rehearsal, so I would appreciate it if everybody would bear with me and have Patience. If you wanna run your lines, fine. Do it backstage, but do it quietly. The only actors that I wanna hear are the ones that are on stage. Please, do me that courtesy. All right, keep your energy up and enunciate. All right, let's get going. You wanna get up? Uh, Romeo? Would you like to get to position, please? Freda, listen, if there's any costumes that aren't quite ready, I'd like to see them on stage anyway, okay? Just so I can get an idea of the whole color scheme. Have a good rehearsal. He jests at scars that never felt a wound. But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun, and kill thy envious moon, for she is- that's fine for now, yeah. You're gonna do fine. The Dean's gonna be really proud of his son. Oh, good. All right, everybody, let's take it from the top! Damn, damn, damn it! - That's not Shakespeare. - The hell with Shakespeare! Well, get angry with him, not me. I'm angry with myself for not telling the police about what happened, and I'm even angrier with Eric for thinking I'm still sleeping with delonge when he knows it isn't true! Typical male chauvinist. He just makes me so damn angry, I could just explode! Doit. Freiden, phone! Who is it? Hello. Whatever I said or did, I want you to know something. I love you, and I don't care what you say. I'll still love you. Well, I love you too. Maybe that's why I got so upset. I'll explain everything. I love you. Hello. Just a minute. Julie, there's a phone call for you. Eric? Hi, Julie. This is Allan. - What? - Don't hang up. I didn't do anything to you. That's right, you didn't do anything. You could've stopped them, Allan, or at least tried. But you didn't. I suppose you know that caulder and dushane have split? I guess they figure you'll dump this whole thing on me. Well, if my name gets into this, my old man will find some way of shutting you up for good. Aw, no prize. Sorry, Susan, no prize. Take another dart, don't be upset. Okay, Susan, four darts left. Seven blues on the board with two prizes to go. No! Allan? Allan? Allan! If you dreamt that he's dead, that he died violently, he is dead. Why are you following me? I just wanna help you. She won't stop. Lisa. She likes the killing. I don't know what's happening to me. I've been having these dreams. There's good and evil within each of us. I watch her. You're not the first. You have to be very careful. I can tell you how to make it stop. I know how to make it stop. I'm going to the police. They won't believe you. I've already told them. You're a vessel for her anger. She kills for you. And when she kills, she is you. Can you tell them that? No! It's a dream, it's not real! It's no dream, people are dying. She's a demon! When she looks like you, then you can kill her. You can't be afraid! You're crazy, both of you! You asked for her help, you wanted the revenge. Yes! - You wanted them to die. - Yes! But not really. I just wanna help you. To be your friend. If you need help, I'll be around the corner of the house. I'll be there alone. You're too beautiful to die. My tongue will tell the anger of my heart! Or else concealing it, my heart will break. And, rather than it shall, I will be free! Excellent, Julie, excellent. Keep that level of anger, it's right on. Julie, I'm so glad you came. Listen. You were so good tonight, so good. I was so proud of you. Come on in. What do you want, Charles? I've just missed you, that's all. It's been a while, you know? Here, sit down, sit down, sit down. I've been so busy with the theater and listen, why don't we smoke a little framus and uh, relax, huh? Charles, whatever we had between us has been over a long time now. I have a boyfriend who loves me, and I love him. Well, that's cool. I've got somebody too. I mean, you and me, you know, it's goalies for goody. Hey, remember how you used to love me? I was young and I looked up to you. Really, I learned a lot from you and you're a good teacher. But I'm sure there'll be many others. Well, for you, maybe, but uh, I mean, not for me. I can't just cut it off just like that, you know? I mean, you're just too special. I better go now. You know, you're probably gonna lose your scholarship. I don't need it. I'm getting financial aid next semester. Oh, I don't think so. I don't think you can get financial aid if, uh, if you fail a course in your major. I haven't failed a thing. I have straight as. So far. I can't believe you'd do that to me. Believe it, I would. For what? Why? I don't know. I don't wanna lose you. You mean too much to me. You're no better than caulder or dushane. Oh, now, that's not the way you used to talk about me. Remember, I was ecstasy, or have you forgotten that? No. I haven't forgotten. Good. I'll tell you what. Go on into the bedroom, and I've laid something out on the bed for you. Just slip into it, I'll light a nice fire, make us a drink and we'll take it one step at a time, okay? Go on! Oh, alas, fair maiden. Who knows? You might even enjoy it. Guess what? I've got your favorite bubbly. You remember that night on the beach? Shooting stars. God, it was beautiful. You said it was magical. Oh, you were so naive. You thought you were gonna learn everything in one night. I think you did, too. Julie. You look stunning. Beautiful. Come here. Oh, yeah. Oh, you look better than ever. Oh, you feel better than ever too. Oh, Julie. Oh, god. This is like the first time. Oh, Julie. Oh, Julie. Hello? Lisa! Lisa! Shit. "Upon this candle, I will write, what I require of thee tonight. May the rune of magic flow, by mind and spell and flame aglow. I trust that thou will Grant this boon, o lovely goddess of the moon." You came. I knew you would. Come in. It happened again. Only this time I saw it with my own eyes. Was it someone you were angry with? Yes, but I really didn't want him to die. Oh, Ernest, I'm so afraid. Can you really help me? I do know a way, yes. You have to have courage in order to use it. It will ward off the evil demon she is. This is my avama. With it, you can invoke the elemental lords. All you need do, 'cause of my power, is aim it. The power will focus out in that direction. It is your purpose, with this avama, to command the power of the gods. And do you command the power of the gods, Ernest? Yes! I mean, no, no! I told you not to meddle in my affairs. She's so beautiful. Beautiful? And am I no longer beautiful to you, Ernest? No. I'm ss 0 rry! I'll obey! I'll obey. I'm sorry, I'll obey! It's too late! No! No, no! Is it Eric freiden there? What do you want? Eric? Something terrible has happened. I was just at delonge's house and- yeah, I know all about that. How could you? Well, I just happened to see you kiss him. I can explain, but not on the phone. I need your help, please! Do me a big favor. Save it all for delonge. I'm sure he'll believe you. Listen, I saw something horrible. I couldn't believe it, I was... Eric? Eric! He who was outcast as unclean and vile! More vile than the bowels of deva! We call thee now, heed our position! Send forth thy angel of vengeance! Ernest? Ernest? Ernest? Ernest? What're you doin' here? Eric? Are you sure you wanna do this? Oh, my god. Eric! Freda, you've got to come with me. Julie, Shaun's on his way over here for dinner. She's killed them all! Paul, Carl and Allan. I dreamt about it but then I saw her. Me, it! I saw this horrible monster and it killed Charles. Now she's after Eric. We've got to stop her. Please, you've got to help me. Okay, let's go. I've gotta get to Eric! Julie? Wait a minute, wait a minute. Don't hurt him! Leave him alone! Stop it! No! No! Stop it! Stop it! Why are you doing this? You were angry, and wanted revenge. I am the demon of vengeance. You called me forth and now I am free. Go away. I didn't know. I didn't understand! Not him. I love him. It's too late. It can't be. It can't bel You can't have him. I love him. He is mine now. You guys! Come on. Is everything okay? Will you please open this door? Julie. Julie. Eric? Eric. I love you. Did I just miss something?
