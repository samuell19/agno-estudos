Now listen, men. Spring is here... and spring is a dangerous time of the year, especially in Paris. The wanderlust is in the air. Travelers are coming here from everywhere - from Cincinnati and Singapore. - Now, what do they come for? - We know. That's right. Chicago packers don't come here for a plate of cold cuts. Big planters don't come from Brazil just for nuts. From Norway and Sweden, they don't come here to fish. But whether they come from Amsterdam or Birmingham or Siam... we let them do whatever they wish. We let them play in any way... as long as they're willing to pay. That's okay. But spring is here. And after dark, our cafés are empty. But every park has standing room only every night. - Now that's wrong. - That's right. The situation is not funny. Our best cafés are losing money. We must clean up the public parks. We must clean up the public parks. Cleaner parks and more prosperity. Cleaner parks. Cleaner parks. More prosperity. More prosperity. Come on. Come on. Where do you think you are? What are you doing? What's going on here? The French Revolution. Hey! You can't make love in public. - I can make love anywhere. - No, you can't. - Oh, but, Officer, he can. - Darling! Get up. - What's your name? - Dr. Bertier. And your name? Madame Bertier. - So you're married, eh? - Yes, Officer. And you expect me to believe that? - Oh, please. - Please. Now let me tell you something. You're the only married couple in this park. Get out! Well, there's only one other place to go. Why not? Listen, Officer. Do you see that moon? If he could talk French, do you know what he would say to you? Phooey. Ladies and gentlemen, I must talk to you. This is a very delicate situation. There is Colette, and here am I. And I know what you think. Oh! I know. How dare you. You remember that policeman? He was wrong. And so are you. Believe it or not, we are married. I am her husband. And she is my wife. And I can prove it to you. Oh, look. This is a picture of our wedding. Myself and the bridesmaids. And this is my wife. Before the wedding, naturally. And look at this lady. My mother-in-law. A marvelous cook. In other words, I am married, and I like it. I'm sorry to disappoint you. Now, gentlemen, as a doctor... let me ask you a personal question. How long since you have been in a park? I mean - I mean, with your wife. Ah. Ladies, that's what's wrong. Build up your park life to ensure your home life. Darling. That's for me. Sweetheart. That's for her. I'll be with you in a minute. That's for both of us.

But, darling, you don't even know who it is. It's Mitzi. My old school chum Mitzi. - Not Mitzi! - Yes, Mitzi! Oh. Mitzi! Andre, what have you against Mitzi? - You don't even know her. - No. - I want you to meet her. - Yes. - I know you'll like her. - Mm-hmm. She's the very best friend I had until she moved to Lausanne. - Mm-hmm. - And now she's come back. Mitzi, Kitzi, Fitzi, Bitzi. So that's Mitzi. That's she. My wife. When I married her, she was a brunette. Now you can't believe a word she says. That's all very well, Professor, but have you any proof? As a prospective client to a detective, let me ask you a question. Would you call me handsome? Well, as a detective to a prospective client, uh, no. - Have a cigar. - Thanks. Now let me ask you another question. As one man to another, would you call this a beautiful woman? Oh, sweetheart. - She's lying again. - Lie back. - Yes, angel? - Good morning. Good morning. Are you busy? No. Not at all. Well, uh, I don't want to disturb you. Good-bye. Good-bye. In Switzerland we have a very peculiar law. When a husband shoots his wife, they put him in jail. - Is this taxi engaged? - Yes, madame. Oh, that's too bad. But, madame - - Really, I - I hate to do this, monsieur. - It's perfectly all right, madame. But perhaps both of us - Perhaps I could drop you, if you - - I'm going towards the Bois. - So am I. - Oh. That's fine. - Oh, that's splendid. - Professor- - Yes. Speaking "detectively," you're as good as divorced right now. Do you think the Five-Year Plan will go over? Madame, I don't believe in making plans. Neither do I, monsieur. I leave everything to the moment. It's a very good place to live in. You know, I think it was awfully sweet of you to take me along. I think so too. Oh, monsieur, you're conceited. No, madame. I am married. So, you have a wife. Mm-hmm. And she has a husband. Mmm. I can imagine. - Madame. - Monsieur. Tell me. Do you see anything wrong in us being alone together in this cab? - Absolutely not. - Neither do I. Two strange people of opposite sex, riding in a cab... sitting side by side. The gentleman reading a newspaper. The lady looking out of the window. Explain that to your wife. She won't believe it! Would you believe it? - Never! - I wouldn't believe it myself. No, and let me tell you something. My husband wouldn't believe it either. Your-Y-Your- Oh, m-madame, we're in a terrible situation. Oh, we're as good as guilty. All the facts are against us. What shall we do? Throw your newspaper away and let us face the facts. Madame. Monsieur. Driver, stop! Madame, you may think I'm a coward. I am! - Mitzi! - Colette! Darling! You look marvelous! Oh, Mitzi, my darling. How have you been? I haven't seen you since that day in Lausanne. I've so much to tell you I can hardly begin. But weren't we happy and gay in Lausanne? You look just as smart and as stunning as then. Oh, I'm much wiser, though, thanks to several men. Oh, how's the composer you went with so much? He's gone, but he had such a wonderful touch. And the painter who painted you all draped in gauze? One night I found out what an artist he was. Your boudoir's adorable, simply divine. And that bed - It's too gorgeous. I wish it were mine. My favorite perfume. Femme de Paris. Yes. Andre's so generous. He gave it to me. - Ah. - Oh, I must show you my new lingerie. Too stunning for only a husband to see. - Those dresses - how thrilling! - Yes, they're really quite fair. I was just telling Andre how I've nothing to wear. - Ah? - Of course, these are his. Oh, they're as cute as can be. But where is the rest of them? Oh, pardon me. - Well - - Colette! I buy all his things, and believe it or not, he wears even the ties. - Well, he must love you a lot. - How's the professor? - Which one do you mean? - The one that you married. - Oh, he's still on the scene. - You don't sound so happy. Unless you're well mated, this business of marriage is much overrated. Oh, Mitzi, you don't know how sorry I feel. As for Andre and me - well, he's just too ideal. He sets me atingle.

I'm crazy about her! - Then why don't you want to go? - Because I don't want to mix "musiness" with Bitzi. Business with Mitzi. Oh, Mitzi, Kitzi, Bitzi. All right. I'll go. Yes, Madame Bertier. Yes.

One question follows an answer. You know? Eight minutes - Eight minutes can go like that! Yes. Yes. Then you, uh - you got out of the car. You went to the house, and at the door... my wife handed you the key. You unlocked the door... and after a short conversation, you went in. This was exactly 2:51. Uh -Am I boring you? Oh, not at all, Professor. Uh, yes, y-your wife - your wife said... "Wort you come up and have a little brandy?" And I said, "Ah, a little brandy can't hurt." - So, I - I went up. - Yes. And, uh - And you had the brandy? Yes. Was it good brandy, Doctor? Excellent, Professor. You drank this brandy from 2:53... to 4:44. Professor, I assure you... that there is absolutely nothing wrong. We just -We just had a chat... and a few laughs. You know, y-your wife - your wife is very amusing. Yes, everyone says so. It must be true. Now, Professor, all appearances are against me. I know. I know. But let me tell you again - Not another word, Doctor. - I believe you. - Thank you. You're very welcome. I believe you. But no one else will. Too bad, isn't it? I just came up here this morning to ask you... if you would appear, voluntarily, as a... shall we say, witness in my divorce suit? Professor, please believe me. I'm an innocent man. I'm not guilty. And neither is Mitzi. I mean - I mean, your wife. My friend - May I call you my friend? - Please. - My friend, nobody is guilty. I have a theory that nobody is responsible for their actions. Right! That's absolutely right. Our doings are controlled by circumstances over which we have no control. Oh, excellent. Truer words have never been spoken. Therefore, nobody can be held responsible for his actions. Oh, what a beautiful thought, Professor. You know - You know that you're a poet? This, of course, has nothing whatever to do with our case. - Good morning, Professor. - Madame. Ah, I'm so glad you dropped in. We should see each other more often. I'm afraid the doctor doesn't like me. Oh, Professor. Where did you get such an idea? Oh, by the way, how's Mitzi? - Mitzi? - Yes. Oh, Mitzi. Uh, let me see. She left this morning for Lausanne. - Lausanne? - Mmm. - Oh, to see her mother. - I suppose so. - I hope nothing's happened to her mother. - To her mother? No, I don't think so. Well, we'll see. I'm sorry, but I must be going now. Well, you must come again sometime. And when you write Mitzi, you'll give her my best regards, won't you? Oh, I surely will. And yours, Doctor? Please. - Well, good-bye. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. Don't you think he behaved strangely? Oh, no, not at all. Andre? There's something wrong between the professor and Mitzi. Oh. What an idea, Colette. I feel it. I feel it. My womars instinct tells me. And there's a man in it. Andre?

Was -Was it a good breakfast? Marvelous. Had a - a good night's sleep? Yes. Wonderful. - Feel strong? - Great! Strong enough to face - to take a-a nice - a nice, long walk with me? I'd love it. Sit down, darling. Darling, I've got to disillusion you. Your instinct was right. There is something wrong in Mitzi's marriage. Didrt I tell you? Didrt I tell you? And who wouldn't believe me? Oh, darling, tell me. Tell me all about it. You were right. There's a man in it. Rodovsky? - No. - Goldberg? - No. - But who is it, darling? Tell me, who? Me. You? You? My husband... and my very best friend. Look at me, Andre. Oh! Go away! Either you leave this house or I do. - But, sweetheart - - Our marriage is over. - Darling - - From now on you're nothing but a doctor to me. - I love you. - Tell it to my lawyer. Believe me, there was nothing wrong in it. I know I shouldn't have done it... but please, please forgive me for-for what I didn't do. I don't want to hear another word! You can keep the house, my jewels, the furniture, everything! I don't want any alimony! How do you do, sir? Adolph. Don't go. Sweetheart, you must forgive me. Forgive you? I'm in no position to forgive you. You think you were bad? No. You were just a naughty little boy. Look at me. I'm the one that's bad. You think you're a Don Juan, eh? Well, if you're a Don Juan, then I'm a Cleopatra. You, with your one hour. What's your one hour compared with my 25 minutes? Remember the dream I told you about Adolph and me? Well, that was no dream. It happened, right here, on the night of our party. - Oh, so you think a man couldn't fall in love with me. - Let me kiss you. - You think I'm not attractive enough? Maybe I'm too old. - Well, I'll show you. - Oh, darling! Darling. Adolph! Adolph, I want the truth... and nothing but the truth. After the party was over, did you or did you not... wait in the garden till after Andre had gone? And didn't you come into the house in the dark? And didn't I find you on the couch? Yes. Well? Sit down! And then, Adolph, didn't you, with - with an uncontrollable impulse - didn't you untie your tie? - Yes. - Well? Sit down! And then, Adolph - then didn't you take me in your arms and kiss me? And didn't we sit on the couch, and didn't you kiss me again? And didn't I like it? - I guess so. - Answer yes or no! - Yes. - Well? Sit down! Well, Doctor? We're even. A tooth for a tooth, an eye for an eye... an Adolph for a Mitzi. Fifty-fifty. But if I ever catch you aga - Kiss me, sweetheart. - You don't mind, do you, Adolph? - No. - Ladies - - And gentlemen - - If he were your husband - - And she were your wife - And you find out he's a Don Juan - And you find out that she has dreams - - And he confesses - - And she admits - - But you like him - - And you love her- - And you adore him - - And you're crazy about her- What would you do? That's what I do too.
