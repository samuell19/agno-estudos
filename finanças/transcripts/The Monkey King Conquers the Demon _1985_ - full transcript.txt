Monkey King Conquers the Demon The Monkey King had been trapped by the Buddha in Five Finger Mountain. 500 years later, he is saved by Tang Sanzang, who is on his pilgrimage to the West. Understanding that the Monkey King will be difficult to control, Tang places a magical circlet on the Monkey King's forehead. Once Tang speaks out spells, the magical circlet will give the Monkey King headache. But later, the Monkey King becomes loyal to Tang and protects him on his pilgrimage to the West. Later on, Tang and the Monkey King are joined by Pigsy and Sandy. They face many difficulties on their journey. Report! My Lord, I've spotted Tang's group. So here they are. Yes. They are on the road. Now send out my order! Our preys arrive. It is said that if we eat Tang's flesh, we can be immortal. Oh really? It is true! Then I must catch Tang! He is mine! He is mine! Yours? Don't overestimate yourself! Shut up! Do you really believe you can catch Tang? Our Lord, why do you underestimate us? Don't you know who Tang's disciple is? Sorry, we don't know. He is the powerful Monkey King, who wrecked havoc in heaven 500 years ago. Really? I have heard it. The Monkey King defeated the army of heaven easily. Oh no, I don't believe we can win. We can only give up. No, we can't give up. I have a plan. My disciples, we have faced so many difficulites. We rarely find a place as beautiful as this one. It seems to be a peaceful place. True, but I'm hungry. I need to eat. Me too. Who can find us food? I'll do it, Master. No, I'll go. I don't think we can find any food in this barren place. Let me fly to South Sea and get some fruits. Please get as many as you can, Big Brother. We give you our blessings. Fine. Take care of Master, Pigsy and Sandy. Do stay alert. Can you hear it? Who is asking for help? Seems to be a woman. Who will go to have a look? Master... Master, I'll do it. Help! Don't be afraid. I'm a monk. I see. What happens to you? I encountered a tiger on my way. I was scared and I fell off the hillside. A tiger? Did it eat you up? If I was eaten, why could you talk with me now? Right. Let me help you to get up. I'm painful. No problem. I'll carry you. Please don't. Don't. Stay here. I'll come back soon. I'll come back soon. There is a woman who encountered a tiger. What's up, Sandy? I'll kill the tiger. The tiger is gone, but the woman is injured. She can't walk. Can I lend your horse, Master? As a monk, helping the needed is my duty. Let's go. Master. May the Buddha bless you. Are you alright? I heard that you are injured. I recover. Thanks for your caring. Oh... You recover so quickly. It's dangerous for a woman to walk on the mountain alone. My husband passed away one year ago. I go to the temple to hold a memorial ceremony for him. Master, are you hungry? May the Buddha bless you. Pigsy! Master, why don't you go to the temple. You can stay there and have your meal. Why didn't you tell us earlier? Master, let's go. Where is the temple? It is a short walk across the peak. Please follow me. Let's go. May the Buddha bless us. Master, we need to wait for Big Brother. Oh... Follow me, Master. Follow me. How rude are you! Who are you? Who are you? You're a demon! Help, Master! Stop, Monkey! She is a widow but not a demon. No, she is a demon! Stay calm, Big Brother! A demon can't be so pretty. I see. You become lustful seeing her pretty face. Don't misunderstand. But who wouldn't be lustful after seeing a pretty woman? Monks are still human beings. It's wrong, Pigsy. Sorry. Please forgive me. How can you kill the woman? We are in trouble now. How dare you to kill an innocent woman, Monkey! Wait, Master. Look what she is hiding. I can't believe it. It's your trick, Big Brother. Even if you can fool Master, you can't fool me. It's a lie! How dare you to fool me, Monkey! So painful! So painful! Stop it, Master! Listen to me! Big Brother! Master! Big Brother! Monks should show mercy, but you killed an innocent. I don't want a disciple like you. Oh really? You'll regret. Don't argue, Big Brother. You'll make Master more angry. Forget about it. The woman is dead already. It is useless to do anything now. Let's finish our meal and restart our journey. More arguments won't do any good. May the Buddha bless us. Alright, I'll forgive you this time. But if you make the same mistake next time, I'll punish you even harder. No problem. Mother! Mother! Who is asking for help? Don't worry about it. It is not our business. Yes. We had enough troubles with the woman's case. I don't want another one. Mother! Mother! The voice came from my back, but now it came from my front. Who are you? Why do you cry? My mother went to the temple, but she haven't returned. I'm seeking for her. But I'm so tired now. This kid... Poor kid. Carry him, Pigsy. Fine. Don't! He is ugly. I'm afraid. Alright, it is not my business now. Give it to me. Don't! Give it to me. No, I want this monk to carry me. Yes, only Master is a human being. Pigsy, help him get on the horse. You can't escape, demon! Don't harm him, Monkey! Oh no! Master! Don't escape, demon! How weak you are. Try again. She disappeared. What a cunning demon! Another trap! You must be tired. Please come to my home and take a rest. No. We hurry on our journey. See you and thanks for your kindness. No need to hurry. How dare you to trick us so many times? Monkey! Big Brother! Don't kill him! Get off my way! Help! Help! Stop it, Monkey! Master, he is a demon. Stop! We can't make judgement without reasoning. My eyes can identify whether he is human or demon. Don't fall into his trap, Master. Whatever he is, human or demon... What now? Even if he is a demon, you can't hurt him if he doesn't harm us. Nonsense! I'm so angry now. You killed the widow and claimed that she was a demon. Later you killed her son. And now you claim that this old man is a demon. In your eyes, everyone is a demon. What? Were my daughter and grandson killed? I don't want to live anymore! Kill me! Since you want to die, I can beat you now. Are you really a monk? Your disciple is cold-blooded. Don't badmouth us, demon! Stop, Monkey. I'm gonna punish you. Even if you punish me, I'll still kill this demon. Master. Please stop it, Master. Big Brother. I won't let you escape. Master. Big Brother. Big Brother has fainted. Please stop it, Master. That's right. Please forgive Big Brother, Master. Monkey is disobedient to me. Big Brother. Big Brother. You cold-blooded murderer. Why don't you follow my teaching? You have killed three innocent people. What will Buddha think of us? I don't want you to be my disciple anymore. You misunderstand me, Master. All of the three people were disguised by the demon. The demon wanted to harm you, so I beat him. It is you who fell into the trap, so don't blame me. Master. We need Big Brother. Only he can protect us. Please punish me instead. I've made my decision. I won't change my mind. Master! Go away. Alright. But you need to remove my magical circlet. I don't know how to remove it. Alright. Big Brother. Sandy. Pigsy. Big Brother. Be alert on your journey. It's your duty to protect Master now. Master, I've followed for many years. Now you decide to abandon me. However, please accept my gratitude as your disciple. Then I can leave without regret. Master. Master. Take care. Who is he? He is our king. Our king is back. Our king is back. I've arrived for a while. Why don't you welcome me? Why did you hide yourselves? Since the day you were trapped in Five Finger Mountain, we were injured or killed by the army of heaven. We have had a difficult life. How many of you still survive? No more than a hundred. Aren't you on the journey to the West? Why are you here? It's hard to tell. Why should you be a monk? Please stay with us. Stay with us. Monkey King. Since I've returned, let's decorate our home. Obey my order, the God of Wind. Obey my order, the God of Cloud. The God of Thunder. The God of Lightning. Dragon King of East Sea. Finished. Finished. Thank you all. How nice. It's late now. Let's find a place to stay. Alright. Please take a rest. I'll go and see if there are any places to stay. Protect Master, Sandy. Be alert. I'm free now. It's very late. Why hasn't Pigsy returned? Where does he go? Can you see it? There is a tower. Towers are usually close to temples. But why is there a tower in this barren place? Go immediately. We need a place to stay at night. May the Buddha bless you. May the Buddha bless you. Master! Master! I see. It's you who are disturbing me from sleeping. Your Master is seeking for a place to stay, but you fall asleep. None of your business. How do you know it? I know many things. Tell me more. Your master and Sandy have been captured by the demons. You're lying. Really? I swear that I'm telling the truth. Where are the demons? Follow me. Open the door. Open the door. My Lord. My Lord. Our prey arrives. Where is he? He is standing and shouting outside. I see. So Pigsy finds our base himself. It does save me the effort of finding him. I'll come to see him. No need to do it yourself. Let me do it. Are you afraid of demons? Who is shouting outside? It's me! Your boss! Release my master! Otherwise I'm gonna kill you. It's too late. Your master had been eaten by us. I'm gonna kill you! Oh my God! He escapes. My Lord, Pigsy escapes. Go and catch him immediately. Yes. Mouse. I'm here. Go invite my Granny. Invite her to eat Tang's flesh with us together. Yes. It's mine. It's mine. It's mine. I'll give it to Monkey King. Please accpet our gift. How delicious. Show yourself! Catch him! Yes. Don't run away. It's me. Pigsy. Pigsy. I see. You're Pigsy. Yes. It's me. Why are you here? Aren't you following Master? Master asked me to find you. I don't believe it. Master hates me. I won't go with you. Master really wants to see you. No, I won't go. I am free now. I don't want to be a monk anymore. Forget about it. Master really wants to see you. Get out. This monkey wants to be a demon instead of a monk. How bad he is! Who are you badmouthing? No, I didn't say a word. I'm scared. Why are you badmouthing me? No, I didn't. I swear that I didn't badmouth you. Tell me the truth. Otherwise I'll beat you. Big Brother. Listen to me. Listen to me, Big Brother. Alright. Tell me the truth. I'll tell you the truth. Master and Sandy were captured by the demons. Why don't you tell me the truth? I'm afraid that you are still hating, Master. Let's go and rescue them. Yes. If you come, our enemies will be in fear. Wait. I won't go. What's the matter with you? If Master claims that the demons are innocent, why should I worry about him? Are you serious? No demons are innocent. Come with me. No. I won't go. How cold-blooded you are. It's Master who is cold-blooded. Alright. I'll rescue Master myself. I'll try my best to rescue Master. Even if it is on the cost of my life. You've grown a lot, Pigsy. Monkey King, why do you reject his request? The demons are smart. I'm afraid they are supervising Pigsy. Therefore I reject Pigsy's request on purpose. My boys, stay here and protect our home. I'm leaving to fight the demons now. You bastard! Retrieve! Retrieve! Who are you? Why are you here? I'm enjoying my wine. I'm thirsty. Can you share it with me? Good wine. You're drunken. Where are you going? I'm going to invite my Lord's Granny. We're going to have Tang's flesh as our meal. So Tang is alive. Yes. We can't eat him until Granny arrives. Here is my home. You can drop me here. No. You're dead now. Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! I see. It's Brother Mouse. How are you? I'm fine. Mouse, why don't you greet me? Sorry, Granny. My Lord is inviting you to eat Tang's flesh. Please come. Good daughter. Let's go. Let's go. Yes. Mouse, guide us. Yes. Sandy, I don't know which one of us will suffer first. You're older than me. It should be you. Actually Monkey is older than both of us. But he didn't come. I'm here. Are you tired? Let's eat something. Come. Eat. You fall into my trap. Help! Help! I won't let you escape, demon. Transform. Transform. Let's go. This is mine. No. It is mine. Mine. May the Buddha bless you. Give it to me. Watch closely. Isn't this farmer's tool? How funny Pigsy is! Don't tease me. I'll beat you once I'm released. How cocky you are! We'll cook you first. Report! Granny arrives. Bow to Granny. Granny. Hello. Oh. Why do you laugh? Are you crazy? Look. That Granny looks familiar. Did you meet her before? Look carefully. I've caught Tang the monk. Great. We'll have Tang's flesh as our meal. Then we can become immortal. You're really a good daughter. I heard that Pigsy is also caught. There he is. I want to have some pork. Must be delicious. I'll beat you if I'm released. Don't overestimate yourself. You'll regret for underestimating me. What you have is just a big belly. No, I have a large brain also. Don't be rude to Granny. Is he Tang? Yes. Where is Monkey King then? He won't come. Why? Ask Tang. Where is Monkey King? I've abandoned him. Why? He killed three innocent people. This is a disgrace to the Buddha. Why do you laugh? It was my plan. Those three people were disguised by me. And I broke their relationship easily. How smart my daughter is. Can you show me your tricks? Yes. Take your seat. Appreciate my tricks. Master, follow me. Follow me. Mother! Mother! I want my mother! I want my mother! You have killed my daughter and grandson! How dare you to claim yourself a monk! Master. I want my mother! How dare you to claim yourself a monk! Answer me. Mother. Master. Answer me. Mother. Master. Mother. Monkey! I regret not having listened to you before. Right. What's wrong with you, mother? I'm so proud of you. You are really smart. I'm so happy. Would you like to see my tricks also? Why not? Watch closely then. Transform. How is this? Do I look like Monkey King now? How amazing you are. I am completely fooled by you. Why are you laughing? What are you doing, mother? No, I'm really Monkey King. Die, demon. Fine. How dare you to fool me, Monkey King. I'll kill your master if you keep chasing me. Do anything you want. You can't escape. Transform. May the Buddha bless you. Master. Master. Here is the demon. What should we do with her? I'll let you decide it this time. Fine. Master. Big Brother. Pigsy and Sandy. We have killed all the demons. Monkey. I'm so sorry. Forget about it. Just promise me not to punish me again. Master. Get on the horse. Please. The end
