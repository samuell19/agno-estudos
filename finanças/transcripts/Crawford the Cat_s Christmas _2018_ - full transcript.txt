[music playing] NARRATOR: On the outside of Crawford the Cat's house, Christmas Eve awoke bright and shiny with a fresh, clean blanket of snow covering the ground. While on the inside of Crawford the Cat's house, Crawford the Cat himself awoke, bright and shiny with a fresh, clean blanket of flannel covering him. Did you say it snowed last night? NARRATOR: I did, indeed. Yippee! It's Christmas Eve! And it snowed! Brr! Oh, oh, that's better! My slippers have little Christmas cat heads on them. NARRATOR: I noticed. I like cats. NARRATOR: That's probably a good thing, since you are one. And I love Christmas! Especially when it snows! It makes everything look so, so, Christmasy. [gasp] Hooper's Hill! NARRATOR: Pardon me? Look! Over there! It's Hooper's Hill, all snowy and sparkly! It's just sitting there waiting for me to ride my sled down it! NARRATOR: That sounds like fun! It will be! Oh, oops. My stomach's grumbling. I think I better have my breakfast first. NARRATOR: Good idea. I have a very busy day planned today. I'm going to need lots of energy. NARRATOR: Oh, what do you have planned? I'm meeting my very good friends Harriet and Milow. And we're going to spend the whole day getting ready for Christmas. Christmas tree shopping, Christmas present buying, Christmas cookie baking, Christmas tree decorating, and Christmas carol singing! Oh, oh, and the best of all, at noon, I'm picking up Aunt Kittypat from the train station. NARRATOR: Aunt Kittypat? Aunt Kittypat is my most favorite in the world. She comes every Christmas and spends the holidays with me. We have so much fun. NARRATOR: That's wonderful! I guess I can see why you might need a lot of energy today. Yes. That's why I'm having Crunchy Christmas cereal, Christmas milk, and a Christmas egg. NARRATOR: OK, I can imagine where you get Christmas cereal. But where do you get Christmas milk and Christmas eggs? From Christmas cows and Christmas chickens, of course. NARRATOR: Hahaha, of course. So after breakfast, Crawford the Cat pulled his sled up to the top of Hooper's Hill. He knew that sledding down it would be the fastest way to get to Rudolf's Rink, the place he was going to meet Harriet and Milow. And then Crawford the Cat went whooshing down Hooper's Hill! At 50 miles an hour! And 100 miles an hour! NARRATOR: Can you really go that fast? Even down Hooper's Hill? No, probably not. But it's fun to pretend! NARRATOR: Hahaha, yes. So, down Hooper's Hill slid Crawford the Cat. And when he got to the bottom, he slid right up to the top of Parker's Peak. And then, slid over Manny's Mountain, which wasn't really much of a mountain at all. More like a little speed bump. NARRATOR: Now, at the bottom of Manny's Mountain, Crawford slid directly to the edge of Rudolf's Rink. Hi, Crawford, Merry Christmas Eve! Merry Christmas Eve to you, too, Harriet! Is Milow here, yet? No. He said he had a surprise for us. While we're waiting, would you help me practice my ice skating? I'd be happy to. I'll put my skates on and meet you over at our spot. Great! I'm teaching Harriet how to skate. She's getting better and better every day. NARRATOR: I can tell. So, Crawford the cat and his good friend Harriet had a grand time practicing and skating all around Rudolf's Rink. Hey, Harriet, watch this! I've got something new that I want to teach you next time. OK! Ta-dah! That was just wonderful! I think I'll pass on the ending, though! I think I would, too! Hahaha! This was fun. Thank you, Crawford. It's been so nice of you to teach me how to skate. You're welcome, Harriet. Gosh, that's what friends are for. That's true. Well, as soon as Milow gets here, we can go Christmas tree shopping. Yay! I can't wait! This year, I want to get an extra special one. Aunt Kittypat love to decorate the tree. [sleigh bells] Do you hear that? It sounds like sleigh bells! It is. Look who's coming. It's Milow! He said he had a surprise for us! We're going to get to go riding in a one horse open sleigh! Merry Christmas, Milow! Merry Christmas to you too, Harriet, and you, too, Crawford! Merry Christmas, Milow! What a wonderful surprise. Thank you. I rented from Grandma Guernsey's store. We can use it to go pick out Crawford the Cat's Christmas tree. That'll be fun! What a great idea! Oh, I almost forgot. I've got all of our names ready to go. Oh, goody! See, each year, we put our names on little pieces of paper, and then put them in a hat. Then we each draw a name. Whoever's name is on our piece of paper is the one we buy a Christmas present for. NARRATOR: I see. Here we go! Uh-oh, I got my own name. I got my own name. I got my own name, too! We better do this again. I got somebody else's name, this time. So did I. I got me again. Hahaha! One more time! Did you get yourself? Nope, I got somebody else. I got somebody else, too. So did I. Whose name did you get? Oh, I can't tell. It's a surprise! Speaking of surprises, Aunt Kittypat is going to be really surprised if she gets here and there's no Christmas tree to decorate. Well, we can't let that happen. Let's go! Off to the Christmas tree forest to pick out a tree! Yay! Giddy up, horsey! (SINGING) We're off to find a Christmas tree, riding in a very special sleigh. Not just any Christmas tree, but one that's right in each and every way! ALL: Not to short and not too tall. And we'll decorate it, one and all! We are the best of friends, you see. So we need the perfect Christmas tree! CRAWFORD: We're off to find a Christmas tree to brighten up the house today. A tree that we can all agree is perfect for this Christmas holiday. Looking high and low, and far and near, for a tree that's filled with Christmas cheer, we are searching carefully, for a very special Christmas tree. Sharing Christmastime with friends, makes holidays so bright! ALL: Friends so near and friends so dear, we'll trim our special tree tonight! We're off to find a Christmas tree, a tree like no one else has ever had. HARRIET: A red, yellow, orange, or a purple tree. CRAWFORD: Or maybe, if we're lucky, one that's plaid! HARRIET: Plaid Side by side we sing along this very merry Christmas song! Happy as best friends can be! We hope that we don't miss it! Wait I think I see it! ALL: Our very special Christmas tree. NARRATOR: So, Crawford and his friends did find the perfect tree, and delivered it to his house. Then, it was off to Grandma Guernsey's general store to return the sleigh and do some more shopping. Boy, this is turning out to be the perfect Christmas Eve. Grandma Guernsey said it's OK to leave the sleigh right there. Thanks for renting the sleigh, Milow. It was a great idea! Yes, thank you! You're welcome. Maybe we can do it again sometime. I'd like to. Well, I'd better get going. I have a few things to do before we come over to your house to decorate cookies this afternoon, Crawford. Me too! Could those things to do include buying someone a Christmas present! Haha, could be! See you later. See you later, alligator! After a while, crocodile! Well, I guess I'd better get moving along. Aunt Kittypat's train should be here any minute. And I've got to buy a Christmas present for Harriet. I got her name in the drawing. NARRATOR: So, Crawford the cat headed inside Grandma Guernsey's general store in search of just the right gift for his good friend, Harriet. CRAWFORD: HARRIET: Merry Christmas, Grandma Guernsey. Hi, Crawford. Just the person I was hoping to see. How come? Just wanted to tell you how many folks have said something about that pretty Christmas Garland up there. It does make the place look Christmasy, doesn't it? Oh, it sure does! Just wanted to say thanks again for hanging it for me. I'm a little wobbly on ladders these days. And besides, what I would have done wouldn't have been half as pretty as what you did. Well, you're welcome, Grandma Guernsey. It was fun to do. I'm glad. Now then, what can I do for you? I'll take one of these, please. Oh, these are nice. I'll be right back with it. NARRATOR: Well, that didn't take long. Oh, no. I already knew what I wanted to give Harriet. Do you want to see what it is? NARRATOR: Of course. I got her one of these. It's a Christmas tree ornament. NARRATOR: Oh, that's very pretty. CRAWFORD: There were words on it. It says, "a friend is the best thing you can have, and the best thing you can be." I like that. It's perfect. If I give that to Harriet, she'll know just how much I like being her friend and how much I like her being mine. I think she's going to love it! NARRATOR: And I think you're right. Here you go, Deary. I wrapped it in tissue paper and put it in a little box. Thank you, Grandma Guernsey. GRANDMA GUERNSEY: You're very welcome, Crawford. I'm so excited. We got a tree. I got Harriet and a present. Aunt Kittypat will be here any-- come to think of it, shouldn't she be here by now? It looks like the 12:05 train from Catnip Creek is running late. Oh, Honey, it isn't running today at all. What? But my Aunt Kittypat was supposed to be on it. She's coming to spend Christmas with me, just like she always does. We were going to decorate the tree and everything. Oh, I'm sorry, Sweetie. The snow we had here was nothing compared to what they had over there. The train's snowed in, can't get out of the station for, maybe, a couple of days! Oh, no! Now, don't you worry. The snow can't last forever. You can just postpone your Christmas for a couple of days. But today is Christmas Eve! I know it is, honey. It just won't be the same. You going to be all right, Crawford. Sure, I'll be fine. I just got to make the best of it. Thanks, again. You're welcome, Honey. Oh, don't seem quite fair, him missing Christmas with his aunt, and all. Hm, I wonder. NARRATOR: Even though Aunt Kittypat wasn't going to be there this Christmas Eve, Crawford decided carry on all of their traditions just the same. Yes, Aunt Kittypat would want me to. Oops! Heh-heh-heh! I'm baking cookies, decorating the tree, and wrapping presents all at the same time. NARRATOR: Wow, that's a lot to do! Yes, it is. I sure miss Aunt Kittypat's help. But mostly, though, I just miss her. NARRATOR: I understand. Is that box Harriet's present? Uh-huh. And this is the paper I've chosen to wrap it in. Do you like it? NARRATOR: Oh, yes, very much. Thank you. It'll be so pretty, Harriet won't want to open it. Oh, she'll open it, all right. She'll be real careful, though. Harriet saves wrapping paper and uses it again. NARRATOR: That's wonderful, a recycler! Yes! It is wonderful. But it's also a hard thing to do. NARRATOR: Saving the paper? No, unwrapping presents carefully. I get so excited, that I'm not too neat. NARRATOR: I know what you mean! [beeping] Hooray! More cookies are done! Every year, Aunt Kittypat and I bake Christmas cookies. And then, Harriet and Milow come over to help decorate them. Then we take them to all of our friends. It's a Christmas tradition. NARRATOR: And a very nice tradition. This cookie dough recipe is super, super, super secret. NARRATOR: Three supers? That is secret! Well, it's not really that secret. I'll give it to you, if you want to. NARRATOR: That's OK. CRAWFORD: Mm-mm! NARRATOR: May I have one? Not yet, they aren't quite done. I'll have to reset the timer. [buzzing] NARRATOR: What's that? Well, I'm using timers to remind me of when I need to do something. That one was the tell me to start decorating the Christmas tree. I'm on a schedule. NARRATOR: I see. Oh, forgot to take my mitts off. There. [buzzing] NARRATOR: Another timer? Yes, that's the timer to remind me to wrap Harriet's present. But I've already got that started. Oh, it's nice to be ahead of schedule. NARRATOR: It sure is! I'll just reset this to remind me to finish up the wrapping later. [beeping] Oh, the cookies must be done! Perfect. I'll reset the timer to remind me to put these on a cooling rack in a few minutes. [cuckoo clock] NARRATOR: That timer sounds like a cuckoo clock! It is a cuckoo clock! It cuckoos every hour! And now, it's 3:00 o'clock. 3:00 o'clock! Oh, my! It's later than I thought! I'd better get back to decorating the tree! Now, I'm behind schedule! [buzzing] Wow, already? NARRATOR: That's not the oven timer, Crawford. That was your gift wrapping timer. Oh, yes, thank you. I can't lose track of this, either. I'll be back for you in just a few minutes. The gift's got to be finished first, before she gets here. [beeping] That's the oven timer. Don't go anywhere! Cookies on the cooling rack! Cookies on the cooling rack! [buzzing] Oh, the tree! [buzzing] The gift! Oh, the tree! [doorbell] What's that timer for? NARRATOR: That's the doorbell! Oh, right! I'm getting busy! HARRIET: Crawford, it's me, Harriet. It's Harriet! She's early! Uh, just a minute! I got to hide the gift! Hi, Harriet, come on in. Merry Christmas, Crawford. Merry Christmas. You're out of breath. What were all those buzzer and beeper sounds? Those are my timers, to keep me on schedule. Only, it's not working so well. [warning siren] What's that? That's the timer for my Gilroy Gofer game. It's to remind you to mix up some frosting for the cookies. I've been trying to get everything done, just like when Aunt Kittypat is here. It's been a challenge. I heard that the train wasn't coming today, and neither was your Aunt Kittypat. I'm sorry. I know you look forward to her visits. I sure do. That's why I came early, to see if I could help with anything. Thanks, Harriet! That's very nice of you. Well, as you said this morning, that's what friends are for! Now, then, what can I do? Well, the last batch of the cookies are out of the oven. But we need icing to decorate them. Could you mix up some while I finished the tree? I'd be happy to! I'll make red, and green, and every color in between! Hahaha! That'd be perfect! What's in the bag? My gift for our exchange. No peeking! Don't worry, I don't have the energy! [doorbell] Oh, I'll bet that's Milow! Yup! Hi, Milow! Merry Christmas Eve! Merry Christmas, Crawford! They told me at the store that your Aunt Kittypat wasn't coming. So I hurried over to see if there was anything I could help with. Why, thank you, Milow. You're a good friend. Would you like to help decorate the tree while I finish wrapping a present? Sure! CRAWFORD: Great. All the ornaments are in these boxes. MILOW: Perfect. CRAWFORD: Hey, Harriet, there's more food coloring in the pantry if you need it. HARRIET: OK! NARRATOR: So, with the help of his friends, Crawford the Cat got his presents wrapped, the Christmas tree decorated, and the frosting mixed. And soon, they started decorating Christmas cookies! And we finished decorating them, too! See? NARRATOR: Beautiful! Mine, too? Yours, too! How about mine? NARRATOR: Superior! So, how many cookies did each of you decorate? A lot! More than a lot! Lots and lots! NARRATOR: Oh, my goodness! That is a lot of Christmas cookies! We have a lot of friends! I see! Hey, it's dark outside. Let's turn on the Christmas tree lights. I want to see how I did! Yay! And since you did most of the decorations, you can be the one who turns it on! Thanks! Ready, set, go! Ooh! It's beautiful! I like those twinkle lights. CRAWFORD: Those are Aunt Kittypat's favorites, too. HARRIET: I like the candy canes! CRAWFORD: I like the cat ornaments! Haha! I could just sit here all night and look at that beautiful tree! If we didn't have other things to do, like-- Open our gift exchange presents! Yes! Woohoo! This one is for you, Milow! I drew your name! And this one is for you, Harriet! I'm so excited! I just can't wait for you to see what I got you! This one's for you, Crawford! Who goes first? Let's all open them at the same time! OK! And tonight, I'm not even going to be neat! [cheering] HARRIET: Oh, my, they're all the same! You got him what I got you! And she got me what you got her! And I got you what he got me! Let's all read them at the same time! "A friend is the best thing you can have and the best thing you can be." When I saw that declaration, I thought, I just must get this for Harriet so she'll know how lucky I feel to have her as my very, very good friend. That's why I bought one for Milow. And that's why I got one for Crawford. I guess we're all really lucky to have such good friends, huh? We sure are! I only wish your Aunt Kittypat could have been here to share the fun. Ah, me too. [doorbell] Who's there? GRANDMA GUERNSEY: Hohoho! Santa Claus? Uh, come in? Hohoho again! Grandma Guernsey! Yep! CRAWFORD: What are you doing here? Is everything all right? Hunky dory, and then some. I just stopped by with a little Christmas present for Crawford the Cat. Me? Yep. Will the mystery Christmas gift step in, please? Hello there, Sweetie. [gasp] Aunt Kittypat! It's Aunt Kittypat! Oh, I'm so glad to see you. And I'm glad to see you, too. Where did she come from? How did she get here? How did you find her? Did the train come? No, no train, still snowed in over in Catnip Creek. But I got to thinking that train might make it through the snow, but my good old one horse open sleigh might just make it to Catnip Creek and back. So I decided to give it a try. After all, Crawford's always doing nice things for people all year long. Just wanted to do something nice for him. So, here I am! Thank you, Grandma Guernsey! Oh, 'tain't such a much, really! It is to me! Oh, my you got here just in the nick of time to go with us! We have Christmas carols to sing! And Cookies to deliver! If y'all want, I can haul them in my sleigh! [cheering] ALL: (SINGING) Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way! Merry Christmas, everyone! Thanks for these great cookies! You're welcome! Merry Christmas! Well, the cookies are all delivered. And the songs are also sung! Who's ready for hot chocolate! We are! Giddy up, horsey! Let's go! NARRATOR: So on this Christmas Eve, Crawford the Cat was reminded of something he already knew! The words written on the ornaments they bought for each other weren't just a nice saying, but a wonderful way to live each day. I think this is the best Christmas ever. Me too! NARRATOR: Merry Christmas, Crawford! Merry Christmas! ALL: (SINGING) Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way! Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh!
