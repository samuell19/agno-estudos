Pod will drop in Well? That's definitely it. Does it seem calm? Hmm... Guess I'll try shooting it. That didn't work at all. Yeah, he's savage. Well, he is a wild one, so I supposed it can't be helped. Should I hit him again? Nah, that should be enough. All right. Seems to be dead. Is it starting? Okay, gonna burn it. That oughta do it. Now what? Let's slack off a bit more. Sounds good. What? Trying to see the sky or something? Hmm? Something is falling your way. Something? I dunno. Maybe shoot it just in case? Let's go back already! Let's go back! Let. Us. Go. Back. Now! Umm, it's blinking now'n then. I wonder what it is. Who knows? That's something for the doctor to think about. You're an idiot, so don't bother. You're one to talk! You know, you're just— you're... We're back! Welcome back. Anything good? Doctor, look at this! What is it? Doctor, what in the world...? I do believe it is human. You mean one of the humans from the uppermost level? This sort of head is only a container for the ego. Doctor, what are humans? Our ancestors. In a way, they're gods. This is God... What should we do with it? I guess we could try giving him a body. But isn't that dangerous? Well, it seems he's lost all his memories due to shock, and his life support apparatus is damaged. He won't last long like this. / Understood. I'll begin preparations immediately. Hey! Hey, can you hear me? For crying out loud, don't hit him! You probably don't understand what's going on... Could you bring the mirror over here? Yessir. Okay, now just calm down and have a look. Is this... me? This is... I'm... a child?! -No, you're God! -You, shut up! It'll probably take a while for you to comprehend what happened. Just take your time. No need to rush. You guys take good care of him, now! Okay! Doctor, we're going out collecting. Wait! Take this fellow with you. Roger that! Now listen here. Your head is still damaged, so don't overexert yourself. Got it. Well then, God, let's go. "God"? What's the matter? Mmm... I just can't get used to this body. Well, that's 'cause it's just some junk we found lying around. Junk... Ugh... Yeah, this body is just not... Hey! Grab my hand! You dumbass! Follow us like you're 'sposed to. Otherwise we'll get in trouble! Sheesh, and you call yourself God! I didn't, though... There's a worm hole here, too?! We'll have to come back'n burn it ASAP. There've been more'n more of these buggers lately. What are these? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Don't touch 'em! Why not? If you touch 'em, a scary worm'll come out! Do not touch them! A scary worm? What do you mean, "scary worm"? What kind of worm? God is dead. We killed him... He is risen! Hey! Are you okay? Hey! I shouldn't have bought this. An epidemic of a new type of virus has killed over 200 million people in six months. That's 30% of the population. As part of the search for a way to restore the human race, the central government will launch a study on the subterranean Marigans. Good morning. So, as I mentioned, this will be our last lesson. That's too bad. For me, too. I'm just not making ends meet lately... What are you going to do next? Actually, I'm thinking to apply to be one of the subterranean researchers. Wow! You'll go underground? Yes. I'll get to go on an adventure and make a higher salary. Like this. Wow! I'm sort of looking forward to it. What a wild one you are! Now then, let's begin. Wild men are... so dreamy! Hey! Are you okay? What's gotten into you? Who the hell are you bastards? Huh? Is his. Well, he did hit his head. They don't understand me? Then I have no choice— What?! My attacks had no effect? Huh? What the—?! The hell?! The fuck is this body?! I have no idea what he's saying. He's busted, huh? Poor guy. Fuck! Let me go!! Let me go, you fat bastard!! I'm gonna fucking kill you!! What a racket. Wanna put him in here? I like the way you think. Hup! Piece of cake! Oh, it's just Toro. Long time no see. Sorry, I don't have any food for you today. No, c'mon, I mean it! Do you understand? Yes. Given that we don't even currently have an understanding of how deep the lower levels go, this might be a reckless mission. But we need the genetic information of that Marigan we caught on tape... ...no matter what! What's with you all of the sudden?! This is no good. We gotta hurry up'n get the doctor to take a look at him! Doctor! Come quick! What in the world is going on? He bumped his head and now he's acting all funny! We can't understand what he's saying, either. Now, now, what seems to be the problem? I'm surrounded... That was close. Which way did he go?! I'll try this way! I'm totally lost... Dammit! Buh-bye! Hmph, so they're just beasts after all. Where... am I? Who... are you? Who... ...am I? What're you doing?! Hurry up and close #15! Yes, ma'am! Step on it! Yes'm!! At this rate the pipe's not gonna hold. If that pipe bursts, this whole place'll be blown avyay! We have no other choice. Divert some of #8's pressure into #9 and #12! Here we go! 3! 2! 1! Zero! That was close. Man, though, pipe #8 is really acting up lately. Well, this is an old facility. Outta the way! Sheesh. This is why men are just useless! Can we really leave on our tour the way things are? Hey!! That's not a toy. I'm sorry. You jerk! Go to hell, ya old fart! Hello, Boss. Oh? What's that? Picking up trash again? No, no, I'm sure this will be handy. Wasn't that your excuse last time? It was, wasn't it, sir? ♡ No, I have the feeling this time is different... Like we care about your half-assed hunches! We don't, do we, sir? ♡ Well, in any case, we don't let good-for-nothings hang around here. Right. I'll do my best. Whazzat? Junk! Junk! Oh, Boss. Hey there. How's it going? Fine, sir. By the way, what's that thing? That's the guy I picked up the other day. Hey, you kids! Don't beat him up! Dumbass! Dumbass! Go to hell, limp dick! Rotten brats. This is that trash? Yes. He may not look like much, but he can handle most odd jobs. Feel free to order him around. Really? Seems kinda junky. Yes. The only thing is, he can't talk. How outdated! He understands what we say, though, so it's okay. Really? Then raise your right hand. Okay, put it down. Now your left. What an idiot. He's probably not used to this body yet. Agh, I'm blind! Hey! Don't point that at people. He probably did it on purpose, the bastard. Honey! Whadaya think you're doing? Oh? Is it already that time? Not "Oh"! Don't look at me with that spacy face. Listen. We're going on our gourmet tour. Don't screw up while we're gone! Got it?! Of course! Have a nice trip and don't worry about a thing. We'll see. If you screw up, I'll knock you flat on your ass. Phew, she's finally gone. Indeed, sir. Now we can relax for a while. Then how about we make that dish you like? Yeah, let's do it. Can't splurge except at times like this. Hey, you, piece of junk. Who else?! What's his name? Oh, he doesn't have one yet. Okay. Then I'll give him one. How about Junkers? Brilliant, sir! Okay, Junkers, I have a job for you. All right. Just follow this map, and bring back some mashrooms. 10 of them. Nah, better make it 20. Here's a voucher for them. Don't look at me with that spacy face. Got it?! If you screw up, I'll knock you flat on your ass. Mashrooms aren't good unless they're fresh, so come straight back! Once is enough! Wait right there. Sorry for the wait. Here you go. 20, right? See how they're still alive? Mine are feisty. Thanks a bunch. Oh, well h'lo there. Don't see too many full machine bodies 'round these parts. Where you from? Huh? Can't talk? Must be tough. And wow, you're a mess. Oh, how rude of me. No, no. You're delightful. You got charm. So where you headed? Oh, there, huh? On your way back, then? Is this your first time? Oh, here it comes. Hm? Did you pay the fare? Probably not on your way over either, huh? That won't do. Hmm, okay. I'll negotiate for you using those mashrooms. Okidoke, you can count on me. Cool, cool, I gotcha. Okay, let's go. Boy, though, I can't believe you made it this far. It's so dangerous lately. Really, it's a miracle you survived! All right! I'll escort you back. No, it's no trouble at all. There must be a reason we met. You can... count on me. Okidoke, let's go. You'll be fine as long as you're with me. Whatcha so nervous about? You'll be in trouble if you don't take my advice! H-hold up! This is bad! Look! Look at that! Those guys are known as the Three Hell Ogres. They're horrifying. One wrong move and you might lose your head! Don't look! Oh no! They're glaring at us! We can't escape anymore. We only have one choice now. I'll negotiate for our lives, at least. Gimme the mashrooms. Don't be stingy! If you die, none of this will matter. You shouldn't even have to think about it. There's a good boy. Okidoke, leave the rest to me. Don't move until I say it's okay! Cool, cool. The negotiations were a success. Somehow I got them to spare our lives, although I had to use some mashrooms. Well, you only get one life. Okidoke, let's get going... before they change their minds. Hurry up! Let's go! Let's go! Don't look 'em in the eyes. Boy, that was a close one. If it weren't for me, you woulda been a goner. Hold up. Okidoke, I'm headed this way, so this is where we part. If you go that way, you should make it back. Oh, almost forgot. I'll take a mashroom as a guide fee. You'd probably feel bad if I was so nice and you didn't thank me, right? Okidoke. I'll be going now. Huh? You don't need to see me off. You got a long ways to go, so you should run along home. There're a lot of guys up to no good 'round these parts. Be careful! Okay, okay. Bye-bye! Ta-ta. See... you. Hey! Pipe #8 is acting up again! Open the valve, quick! Hurry up! How about you help, too! Oops, oops. The fire almost went out. Thanks for waking me up. Did you need something? Oh, you can't talk? Hm, hm. You're lost, huh? Well, you know that big corridor you just came from? Walk left down that for two days. Then go up the stairs at the end and walk another day. What is it? This caught your attention, huh? It's a machine that purifies gas. But this flame has to be stable. I make adjustments with this lever. When I make the flame smaller... See? That's what happens. Well, I don't know what'll happen... if the fire goes out. Maybe it's because I've been on my feet for 400 years, but I'm tired. Maybe I'm getting old. Oh dear, that's no good. Don't mean to grumble at you. Take care. What is it? You don't know the way? You're giving it to me? Wow. You made it? Let's see here... So comfy! Thank you! Thank you so much! You're practically a god to me! Oh, Boss! Look! That idiot! How many days does it take to run a simple errand?! You piece of junk! They're all Stale now! You dumbass! Who can eat this shit?! Let's go! So he was just a hunk of garbage after all. Who's this? Where'd you come from? What's with you? Get out of our way! Gettin' pretty saucy there, Junkers! Get outta here, garbage! I didn't do it! Not my fault! Here you go... Hey, Junkers. What're you doing? Don't talk to strangers. We're going hunting, so get ready. Don't miss. No kidding! He's gonna drag me away! Shit. He's escaping. Hey, Junkers. Go reel him in! What? What the heck? Owww. What is he doing? What's wrong, Junkers? ...Hey. Hey, Junkers! Pull yourself together! Wake up! One this big shouldn't be on this side of the electric fence. Is it broken? But if his picture is true, we got a hell of a monster on our hands. Let's get a survey squad together and get ready to fix the fence. I wish we had a little more info... It's fine... You're fixed, huh? That's good. Over there? No! I'm not going! Save me! What the hell is that? A monster like that... What can we do...? Oh, I heard about these great hunters. Oh, I've heard of them, too. Boss! All right, send someone out to fetch them at once. ...Junkers! Nope, nevermind. Be careful. See you soon. Hey, I'm back! Huh? What about the hunters? They're setting a trap and will be here in a minute. What the heck? Are they really the hunters? Yep, no doubt about it. Aren't they sometimes called the Three Hell Ogres on the other side? Hello, hello. Looking forward to having your help. Sure, leave it to us. Thank you for coming from so far away. Seriously, though. I'm beat! Hey, Junkers! Give him a massage! A little harder. Hey, Junkers. Why don't you bring them something to drink? My apologies. He's a bit oblivious. S'fine. No big deal. We'd like to check our gear. Is there a workshop we can use? Sure, right this way. Where're the tools? Right on those shelves. Outta the way! This... Could this be...? Hey, take a look at this! What's going on? Who knows? This is definitely him. What did you guys do with him? Where's his head?! You poor thing... Hey! Do you know who this is?! This is... God!! Tell 'em, God! Junkers—err, he doesn't talk. Hrm, is he broken again? C'mere a minute. Mm, by the way, God... How've you been? Yeah, for real. We looked all over for you. You don't remember anything? It's okay. No worries. You'll remember soon. We have a good way to fix you. Whoa, whoa! That was overkill, you dumbass! We didn't have very many materials, so this is what we managed. Well, it's probably fine. He was already able to see, but now he should be able to talk, too. Don't hit him! Thanks for back then. No, no. You're welcome. I'm sorry I was so rude. Well, don't worry about it. I see... And that's why you're looking for the reproductive genes... So why Toro? Huh? I mean... That's a tail! Right now he doesn't have any hair, but usually he's all shaggy. Ah, don't be so upset. If it's reproduction you're after, how about looking for a tree of life? A tree of life? Yes. We call them trees, but really, they're Marigans that have mutated into tree form. We're born as their fruit. Fruit? Yes. One about this size makes a few hundred. But once a tree produces fruit, it dies. A handful of the fruits have the mothering nature... and become the next trees. But the fruit inherit the personality of the mother. The trees should be cherished and nurtured, but it seems the wild, violent ones... get destroyed. Where can I find a tree of life? That, I don't know. The original tree of life... is somewhere in Kaapvaal. Supposedly it still bears fruit, but I don't know if a human would be able to approach it or not. Is that far away? From here... over a pekora. A pekora?! You can get there fast on the Red Rail. Red Rail? It's the railroad the Red Rail Line runs on. But to get there... you have to go through the area where that monster is. Don't worry. You got us! Yeah, yeah! Thanks, but you know... I've trained, too. ...God! Foolish people! Bow your heads! Uh, you can act normal... Prepare to welcome a god! Hey! Outta the way, dirty brats! They're utterly oblivious! Kids these days... Um, let me down for a second. 'Hey! Cmon! Didn't you hear what God said? But do you really think Junkers is...? Yes. I sensed something special about him the moment I saw him. Brilliant, sir. I heard you're God. Nah, I'm not. I'll tell the villagers to give you some food. - Thanks... But... Uh... I have a favor to ask... What is it? Um... err... I want you to make me pretty. I can't do that. Even though you're God? I'm not... But you don't have to worry about that. I think you're cute the way you are. By the way, have you ever danced before? I'll teach you. Actually, I've never done it in real life, myself, but... Ready? Here we go. Ow! You stepped on my foot! Oh, sorry. There they go. This village will be known for saving God. And that great deed will be attributed, to you. Well... yes, that could very well be. Oh no, oh no. The devil was whispering to me again. But when it's so comfy like this... I get... so slee... py... Achoo! Hm? Earthquake? Dunno. What's heaven like? I don't know, but supposedly it's nice. Didn't you come from heaven? No! Up above is where the humans live. But aren't humans gods? No, not at all. Then where's heaven? Supposedly if you do good things, you go there when you die. But humans don't die, do they? Since I came down here I almost died a lot of times. Up there I had forgotten what it's like, but down here I really feel alive. If these didn't work, it must be pretty huge. This is still fresh. It's close. This'll be a tougher fight now that it's wounded. Let's prep here. High-velocity bullets, I guess? Know how to' use this? I think so. Hold on, I'll get the bullets. There's something over there. O-oh! Why are you following me? Huh? I was just taking a walk, y'know? You can't! It's dangerous here. You should go back. No. I'm serious! You'll get hurt! I'm going... with you. Jeez. What can I say to convince you...? Hokuro! Hokuro! It's no good. This isn't working. The fast bullets are worthless. Guess we have no choice... Is everything okay? Yeah. We're just getting started. But he's so big. Marigans have unstable genes, so there are all different kinds. Just, most of them are stupid. Not as stupid as you, though, right? What?! You jerk! You jerk! You jerk! C'mon, you guys! Time to get serious. But the day after is always so rough... Ugh, you said it. Okay, let's do this. Leave the rest to us. Okay. Here we go! C'mon! Well? Seems to have worked. Something weird is happening. That was close. Speaking of which, is God okay? A- Alexander, watch out! Alexander! You did it. Amazing. Nah. Are you okay, Alexander? A-OK. Let's go over there. Thanks. I'll be fine if I rest a bit. Okay. Is he dead? Hrm, I wonder. Maybe I'll make sure. What do you think? Dunno. This one's stubborn! Hurry up! We can only use the drug once! I know! Go! Now! But! It's fine! Alexander! Over here! Give me your hand! Hurry! If we prop it up with something... Look out! It's no good. My drug is wearing off. Mine, too. We're... done for... Hey, Francis. What, Julian? Do you think we'll go to heaven? Sure we will. I mean... we... saved... God. Don't worry about it. We all have to die sometime. But why did they do that for me...? It had nothing to do with you. Bodies react on their own. Those guys don't regret it. Gross! Alexander, wake up! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! It's no good. The bridge back to the village collapsed. There should be another village up ahead. I have to get back to the doctor. This is where we part ways. Thanks for everything, Alexander. No problem. More importantly... I'd really like to see the world above sometime. The sky is pretty, right? Yeah, it's really pretty. Do you think... those guys went to heaven? Yeah. I'm sure of it.
