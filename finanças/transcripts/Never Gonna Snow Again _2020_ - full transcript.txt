Please. What's that you're dragging? A bed. How may I help you? I'd like to live here. I know you from somewhere. You've been here once before? What have you written here? Place of birth: Pripyat... That's Chernobyl. You were born exactly seven years before the disaster. On the very same day. Perhaps you're radioactive? You didn't specify which languages you know? All of them. What do you want to do? I feel quite strange around you. Please help me. I am taking away your misery, your suffering, your sickness. Like a black stream, it flows from your feet through your body, your head into my hands. Take a deep breath. As you exhale, you become lighter like a piece of dust. Is that bed of yours heavy? You should come by for some chai! NEVER GONNA SNOW AGAIN Oh, Zhenia I forgot. Come in! Get up! I'm so sorry about this mess. Come! Get up! The bus won't wait for you! - Good Morning, sorry. - Lena's ready! He's unconscious: the after-effects of you playing all night! Are you getting up or not? You want a massage in that state? - Mind your own business! - You drank three bottles of wine last night! At your own daughter's birthday party! Mind your own business! Get up! - Get up, Kacper! - Why are you kicking him? - I didn't kick him, I shifted him. - You kicked him! - But you kicked him, I saw it! - Get up! Hold this, please. Eh, we're going to be late! - Listen, get up. - Get up! Oh Lord! Get up! Come on, now. - Take this. - I'm not eating that crap! - Let's go. - Put this on. Listen, I have cycle training this evening, so I'll be home late. See you. Bye. - Thanks, goodbye. - Go on! - Goodbye. - Goodbye, bye. - Come on. - Lena, did you take your mask? Yes, we have everything. Go to the car. Bye bye! The most water is used for... What uses the most water? Do you remember? - The production of meat. - Exactly. Where will we do the massage? Here, I guess... What a mess... Poo! Hi. - Aren't you going to school? - No. I'm pooing. Have you seen Santa yet? It's too early. There's no snow. It'll never snow again! Maybe I won't draw the curtains, the light is so nice. We have a lovely view here. I'm sorry. I want juice! And the iPad! Can't you see I'm having a massage? Take the iPad, I'll get you some juice later. I want juice! And the iPad! I said you'll get it in a moment. Blanka! How many times have I told you not to spit on your mother! I'm sorry. I'm going to tell your father that you're spitting again. Zhenia, juice? Juice? There, take it. Don't spill it on the iPad! We won't buy you another one. Sit down here. I'm sorry. My son is very independent. He orders Uber Eats all by himself. Although the last time he ordered it, the guy spent ages driving around the estate. He was lost, I doubt he had a driver's license. The food was cold. Which isn't that bad. My friend told me she once got a pizza with a bit chewed off! Maybe they were hungry! But you can't communicate with them. It's insane. Well, obviously, they're all Pakistanis or Ukrainians... I'm so sorry Zhenia. I hope you didn't take what I said about Ukrainians personally... Of course not... Everything's fine. You are different. You're wonderful. Slut. What does that mean? No, that's... Blanka... Better stick to your drawing. Draw Zhenia! No, of course, I'm all for it. I'm... I'm very tolerant. Too tolerant, even. You know, when I think about how hard life is for you in Ukraine, I... Funny, I've never been to the East. I mean, apart from Asia. But that's not the same. It's not. My God, that smells beautiful. What is it? Comfrey and pine. I love it. I feel like I'm in a forest. A pinecone... wilderness... It makes me think of you. I feel instantly energised and relaxed. I can feel it under my fingers. You can feel me relaxing? Of course. It's all interconnected. I feel everything. Stress, fatigue... psychotropic meds... alcohol. Right here. Tension caused by high heels. - It hurts! - It hurts, I know. But I can also feel the effects of regular massage. Looking at your body, I'd say you're 28. You're exaggerating now... Yes, really! Although... I'd give myself 35. But I look after myself. You are asleep. You are asleep. You are asleep. I am your healer. I am taking away your misery your suffering your sickness. Like a black stream, it flows from your feet through your body, your head into my hands. Take a deep breath. As you exhale, you become lighter. Like a piece of dust. Don't be afraid! He's just saying hello! Thank you. Please get up slowly, you might feel dizzy. God, I was thirsty. Fuck, it's that awful guy. I could've fucking killed you! He only moved in recently. You cut me off! Watch what's happening on the road! He was in the army. Ex-soldier. He fights over everything. Take it and get lost! I heard he goes around with a loaded gun. The kids saw it. Good Morning! I'm quitting smoking. I heard that hypnosis can be very helpful. Thank you. Perhaps you know how to do hypnosis? Goodbye, Zhenia. A gift. Come in. It's nice to see you, Zhenia. Where will we do the massage? Sir, could you help me? My name is Zhenia. There. Thanks, Zhenia. It smells nice. It's from my region. From Pripyat. From Chernobyl? Close by. So, it's radioactive. Possibly. You know, I felt much worse after chemo. I tried everything: radiotherapy, brachytherapy, chemotherapy, induction therapy, Tai Chi, acupuncture, and then... all they suggested was palliative care. How about hypnosis? No... I haven't tried hypnosis. But I only believe in natural methods! I've worked through it. I can feel the illness retreating. You said yourself that you can feel it retreating, right? Yes, of course. I feel the illness isn't as strong as it was. Oh, Vicky dear... I asked you not to smoke. I'll put it out in a moment. But you know, the best cures are CBD oil, beta glucans turmeric, mushrooms, garlic, pomegranates, ginger and skullcap... Vicky, what was that skullcap thing? - Baikal. - That's it. Baikal, Baikal... A good diet; herbs And staying warm. Right, Vicky? I feel it leaving me, you know? Sir, don't be scared! They're just saying hello! Is your mom home? Zhenia. Thank you. I think he's disturbed. Jan's friend, unfortunately. Some strange people have moved in recently. It used to be all pheasants and meadows. Pheasant. Pheasant. Oh, Fazan? Fazan. Where will we do the massage? There. Bye, darling. - Bye. - Bye. Hello. Hello. Hello, Zhenia. Down! Don't be scared, that's just how he says hello. Go on! I can feel the effects of regular massage. - Judging by your body, I'd say you're... - Go on? 35 years old. Not 28? Well, no. I'm not concerned about my looks. Most people here care only about their looks and whether they look better than others. The results, may I add, are poor at best. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Aren't you going to school today? He doesn't have to. He won the Olympiad. The Olympiad? So, you are a sportsman. The Chemistry Olympiad. He knows how to make aspirin, he'll be making amphetamines soon. Clever boy. I can feel the stress and fatigue under my fingers. Alcohol. Drugs. Your thinking is stereotypical. Psychedelics happen to be very effective cures for PTSD, phobias, and anxiety and I have a long history of anxiety in my family. Besides, psilocybin, ayahuasca, the vine of the soul, the devil's snare, wormwood... And that fashionable thing now... MDMA. MDMA? Methylenedioxymethamphetamine. You are an ignoramus. How's your perception? What do you see? Circles. I don't care about the circles. I see a point. A dot? I see a point, you see circles. You - a dot. Me - circles. From your point of view, it's: you - a dot, me - circles. Me - a dot. You - circles. Why do you agree to everything? You offend yourself. You have to understand that thoughts are separate. Thoughts mustn't arouse your emotions. I made an observation, I shared it with you and then you had an emotional response. This is the model taught by your parents. Me - a dot. Me - a dot. That's just what I needed! Thank you. Tell me, what is it that you have in your hands? What's in these hands? Graphite? Some other type of isotope? I feel high! Look how much energy I have! Look! I'm... I'm... I'm practically bursting! Vicky dear, I asked you... One a day. You know how much this illness has given me? I... I wouldn't swap places with anyone. I live a much fuller life now... ...than I did before, you know? Vicky will tell you. I've changed. Right, Vicky? Yes - darling - you've changed. You've no idea what we're preparing for Christmas. By the way, what are you doing for Christmas? I haven't thought about it. It'll be mind-blowing! How long have we been preparing? Three weeks? Yes. You must come to our school play! Kacper will be delighted! Have you heard about Houdini's metamorphosis? He did this thing... He went and put... Don't bother Zhenia. Oh, right... I don't want to give it away. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Remember, you've got to come to the play! Sure... It's going to be something else! - Why aren't you singing? - I don't know when to start. One more time. Focus. One, two, three... I keep getting this "la nuit" wrong... Don't you know what "la nuit" means? I don't. You don't understand any French. I don't, but you should be glad I want to help you. Then why do we go to a French school? So that YOU can understand it! Don't argue, focus! That makes no sense. Focus. ...and! For fuck's sake! It's wrong to speak to your mom like that. Mind your own business. Everything I do in this house is wrong, Zhenia. For your information: everything wrong. Everything. Hello. - Aren't you having a massage? - No, I'm not. Look at my finger. Follow my finger. Close your eyes. You are plunging deep into yourself. Listen to my voice. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. I don't like... I don't like it. I don't like that bike. I want my daddy. I want my daddy. Where is my daddy? I don't know. When you wake up you will feel a wave of energy. On the count of three. One. Two. Three. How are you feeling? I felt so good. Thank you. - Bye, darling. - Bye. I should hurry, or I'll be late. - Good Evening. - Evening. Some guys were asking around for you. Two of them. Let's go. You want to dry up? Want some chai? Here he is! Here he is! Wonder Zhenia! My saviour! - Please, please save me! - Hello...? Quick! Quick! I... I've never massaged a dog. Hugo... is suffering terribly. He's apathetic. No, I mean... Oh yes, I understand. Perhaps you could... rub his tummy? Rub his tummy? But wait. You're completely soaked. Please... Please... Please get undressed. Let's get this dry for you. - No, no... - Oh yes, yes. I'll do it myself... He's let one fucking rip! Perhaps you are hungry? I could make Zhenia a sandwich? You're rather... skinny. We have to eat! A good appetite is a sign of health. You visit that man from No 33, you've seen what he looks like. Is it now trendy to starve yourself? Perhaps he's sick? - Cheers. - Cheers. That's nice. I'll fuck those bastards up. I'll fuck them up! Fuck off out of here! Are you going to film me, huh? We have permission. I don't give a fuck about your permission. Fuck off out of here! Now! Fuck off out of here! - Please calm down. - Calm down? - Put that rake down. - Huh? - Wait till I whip your ass... - Calm down. There's no way you're cutting them down! What, you bastard? - What? - Calm down. Dicks. Get the fuck out. You too! I'm very upset today. Very. We're not going to do the massage today. I'll pay you, of course. The tree will grow back. My husband is buried there. I composted him illegally. You composted him? Compost. Fertilizer. His body is fertilizing the soil. Jan helped me. He knows about those things. Do you even understand the concept of the afforestation of the Earth? How's it going? Does it last long? Does the high last long? Come to the little tree. Come. Come and help. Help daddy. Hold it. Hold it! Hold the little tree! Look how green it is! Look! Come here to daddy! Come on. Give me a hug! It's alive, you know? It's alive. Now shout! I was always scared of shouting. Don't be afraid to shout. Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. Don't! Don't! Don't! Don't! Smell it! See? Alright then... Now we'll decorate it. Hold this! Hold it. Your husband left this. You don't fancy her, do you? Who? Vicky? I meant that drunk with the bulldogs. Oh, her. I was wet. She helped me. Oh. That Vicky is 10 years younger than me. Would you believe it? She looks so old. She's a good person. She's pretty. I mean, I don't think so, but... Shame about her husband. Such a nice man. Come in Trick or treat! Trick or treat! I was thinking... That, um... That maybe we should give hypnosis a try? Mom... Mom, can you hear me? Look into my eyes. You are plunging deep into yourself. You are plunging deep into yourself. Close your eyes. I'm starting to count. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. I died. There's so much beauty in the world. So much beauty. I heard it'll never snow again! It'll never snow again! I heard that too. But maybe it will. I find you attractive. And because you know my body, we can go further than normal when it comes to sex. Hugo! Borys! Filip! My boys! Hugo! Hugo! Borys! Filip! Let go, Blanka. Come on. Go with Mom. Take that. You smell like a Christmas tree. Come on, Blanka darling. We'll be back after ten. You can heat up your dinner. Alright. It's a shame you're not going with us. I just don't have the strength. Goodbye, Zhenia. Goodbye. Right there, right there... Do you have a girlfriend, Zhenia? I don't have the time. You don't have the time... How do you deal with that kind of stuff, then? You look like the kind of guy who knows what he's doing. - Maybe. - Yeah, maybe. Don't be shy! Tell me, what kind of girls do you like Zhenia? Blondes, brunettes, eh? Zhenia...? Do you prefer fat girls or skinny ones? Eh? What turns you on, Zhenia? Come on, don't be shy. Zhenia? Ow, Zhenia! You're living the life, Zhenia. Make the most of it before you have a family, pal, because it all gets complicated after that... Don't think bad of me, Zhenia. Don't think bad of me. Hi. Natural Remedies for Cancer I would like to tell my children that I love them. I hope I'm 1020 years old when I die. Many years of life ahead. Life is wonderful, Dad. Dad planted a tree? When it grows, you'll be able to hang baubles on it for Christmas. Do you like playing football with your Dad? What's your favourite team? Mine is Shakhtar Donetsk. I know who you are, Sir. My husband died. I forgot to text you. I'm sorry. You don't have to come here anymore. There's no need for that. No need. No need. Hello. Sorry. I came to the wrong house. No, no. It was me who called you. Come in. It's cold in here. I never feel cold. I heard you have great abilities, Sir. Hands up! Oh, no, no... Take it easy. - Cheers. - Cheers. He should ...take part... in the Olympiad! A sportsman! Sportsman! And you... You're single, aren't you, Zhenia? How lonely is my path, far away from home which I cannot see under the snow How can I feel the unease of foreign lands If I can't even remember my own... I'm a superhero! I will save you all! All of you! Zhenia, I'm waiting for you... Is anyone here? After the explosion, radioactive dust floated in the air. You said it looked like snow. Winter was your favourite season. Oh, the magic of snow... It falls silently, and you will never find two identical snowflakes. When the world is tired, and it wants to rest the snow covers it like a blanket. You believed the snow had extraordinary powers and that you were a superhero. And that if you truly wanted something, it was sure to happen. You would repeat that to me when I was ill. You'd sit by my bed, telling me not to be afraid. "Everything's going to be alright, Mommy." "Look..." "The flowers bloom, but it's snowing." "I'll make you get better." Zhenia... My son. My little son. The school play was very important for him. It's too small. I'll have to adjust it. You won't like it, dear. Everyone can see. A big thank you to the children from our school! You are wonderful! Bravo! Thanks for preparing this wonderful piece with our school choir! Maestra - bravo! And now, time for a magical surprise prepared by Kacper's parents. As you know, Kacper's daddy has left us. Luckily, we have found a fantastic replacement. And so... fingers crossed. And let the magic begin! Stop the music! He's not there! Was he supposed to be there? He's not there! Take the chest... take the chest. Take it... take it. Take the chest. Madame... Where is he? What have you done with him? Good morning. Good morning. We're from the Employment Office. What is this about? Department of Foreign Workers. Do you recognise this man? No. Are you sure? Please take a good look. I know that man! Blanka, what are you talking about? He's a superhero! Are you chasing him because you want to remove his superpowers? Children! I'm sorry, goodbye. Gentlemen! Pardon me... Did that man do something bad? Here lies Marek Roznowski who died aged 58 Beloved Dad and Husband FOR SALE Forecasts indicate the last snow will fall in 2025. Festival subtitles: EJSAK Company
