[music playing] Want to try it? [music playing] [humming] [music playing] [grunting] Mr. Lafleur, are you back yet? Stay here. If he comes back, I don't want him in until he pays his rent. What a mess. Ow! Ooh, damn it. [grunting] What am I doing? I'm going to go back to clean up that mess. [children playing] No. Just shoot me. Every summer. [music playing] Just what I need. I don't have time for this. [music playing] Oh, Mr. Thatcher. Here, let me help you with that. Bless you, Sara. Whoa, those look heavy. Yeah. Is that tenant of yours still missing? Afraid so, Mrs. Thatcher. He'll be back any day now. Those insurance types are pretty reliable. Now, don't you let him keep showing off for you. He's gonna throw his back out again. That McAllister girl, when's she going to get a new fella? And those horizontal stripes. Bye-bye. [radio playing] Davy Howard disappeared once. I didn't know that. Mm-hmm. He scared the daylights out of everyone. Where'd he go? Vacation. He forgot to tell the mailman who was delivering his mail. It piled up, the old man figured the worst. Vacation, now that says intrigue. Yeah, well, people should know to do things without telling someone. Scared the daylights out of everyone. So I hope your tenant comes back, Sara. Everybody knows? Isn't there anything more exciting going on? No. No. Nigel Bowers' wife's pregnant. She was going to find out, sooner or later. Nigel's having a baby? How nice. His wife, actually. Twins. How fertile of them. Bye, Alice. It's OK. Uh, Nigel, you know, dumped me a long time ago. Right. At least, what? Uh-- uh, four years? Five? Five. Right, right. That, uh, that summer that your parents died. Thank you. [beeping] Uh-oh, what do we have here? Mr. Maldon to the register, please. I'm right here, for crimey sakes. Well, what's the problem? Uh, your-- your card, it rejected the charge. $26? Let me see that. Well, you're probably over your limit. You know how fussy these banks are now days? Let her take it on credit. Oh, no. No, really, Mr. Maldon. I-- Now, now, Sara. What are you going to do, run out of town on me? I've known you your whole life. Why-- why that bucket's liable to be more unpredictable than you are. You know what I mean? Yeah. Um-- I'll bring you a check. Bye. Bye. NANCY: It doesn't mean you're boring. More predictable than a bucket? Only cement is further out on the boredom spectrum. Stop it. It just means you're responsible. That's not bad. It would go cement, Sara McCallister, bucket, then maybe lint. Just stop feeling sorry for yourself. I'm more boring than lint. I just want to withdraw $200. Mm-hmm. N-O. What? We can't take out what you don't have in. Shoot me. OK, just give me whatever I have in there. NANCY: Deposit, please. Ooh, this is going to hurt the bank. Sara, a word? Maybe you should have worn those vertical stripes today. Nigel, congratulations. Twins. Sara, I know we have a, uh, history, and, uh, I'm trying to be understanding, but I'm the manager here, not just your ex. I don't know, Nigel, since you dumped me before we were married, does that actually make you my ex? Oh-- technically speaking. - Is that sarcasm, Sara? - Sorry. I'd be remiss if I didn't bring to your attention the condition of your finances. They're not exactly shipshape. More like shipwreck. I know. But right now, Nigel-- No-- no-- you're-- you're-- behind in your mortgage-- I know, and I promise you. I'm sorry to barge in like this, but Sara's got to come with me. It's an emergency. An emergency? Haircut. An emergency haircut? It's a girl thing. An emergency haircut? I got flustered. Lying isn't my thing. You're something else. What else is it going to be? An emergency dye job? I'm a natural blonde. Blonde? Wait a minute. This is "mouse," or "dish water," but I could make you really blonde. What am I going to do? How about a cute little pixie cut? Or-- or maybe we could go platinum? Ugh, stop, stop! I'm having a breakdown. Russell Lafleur is gone, along with his back rent. I'm broke. I'm on the verge of losing my family's home. How is platinum going to help? Platinum tells the world, my middle name is "adventure," things happen. I mean, come on. When was the last time you had a real date? A date? That's like a fig, right? Sara, let me spruce you up. [music playing] (ON THE RADIO) It's another beautiful spring day in Schomburg Cove, Maine. It's 11 AM, you're tuned to 93.2 FM. It's 71 degrees, looking for a high of 75 today. Beautiful and sunny. This one's going out from-- Wait a minute. Mr. Lafleur, you're back! Mr. Lafleur, hello. Welcome home. Mr. Lafleur, I have some mail for you. Hello? Mr. Lafleur? [muffled screaming] Shh-- shh-- shh-- no yelping now. Promise? Let me go. I'd love to, darling, but, uh, you're the one who's got the grip on me. See? Exactly who are you? Flynn. You're a friend of Russell's, Mr. Flynn?-- Just Flynn. Flynn. Right. How did you get in here? I broke in. Oh God. Don't Oh no. No, please-- uh-- FLYNN: See a ghost? You don't look like an assailant. FLYNN: Who's being assailed? Well, if you understood the definition, it-- Oh, I do. What I don't understand is whether keeping your butt from hitting the floor is attacking, raiding, or storming. Please don't hurt me. Oh, just shoot me. No! Ha, I mean-- nervous-- don't shoot me. I'll do anything. Anything you want. Please. Please don't shoot. Please. Make me an omelette? Please? Nice place. SARA: Thanks, I'm sure you only pick nice places to burgle. Now, technically, it's a B and E, ma'am-- breaking and entering. You're good at that. Doesn't take a lot of talent. Secret is a sharp-- So, Flynn, onions with your omelette? Oh, only if it's not too much trouble. Here. Thank you. Oh, do-- do you have any white wine? Wine? Uh, forget it. W-- would you mind if I wash my hands? Onions, you know? Eat. I'll be right back. [water running] Hello, George? It's me, Sara McAllister. I'm being held hostage. Yes, in my house. There's a man in my dining room. He has a gun, George. Yes. Hurry. You really didn't have to do the dishes. What, are you kidding? After you cooked? Will that hurt it? No, no. I put all my guns on the piano. No fast moves, OK? So tell me more about Mr. Lafleur. How long's he been gone? I already told you everything. He's not that interesting. He sells insurance. Then how about playing something for me. I'd love to hear-- No. Absolutely not. Never. Whoa, just a simple question. I don't play in public. Ever. This isn't public, darling. This is just one-on-one. [car door opening] Look, you can rob me or whatever it is you're going to do to me-- GEORGE: Open up, police! Huh, George-- George in here. He's got a gun! Hurry! Ha ha! How you doing, George? That's all right, Jim. Go wait in the car. Flynn, we'll I'll be god darn. I haven't seen you since that bank thief. Good to see you, man. You're looking good! Wait a minute! Hold it, George! This is the way you treat known criminals? Flynn is one of the best bounty hunters in the country, Sara. Now, you should be proud to have him as a guest. Guest? He's an intruder, George. I have a, uh, bench warrant here for a Benny Fortrell, a.k.a. Russell Lafleur. GEORGE: What's he done? International antiquities thief. Ancient statues and coins. Not my thing, but, you know, Greece seems to want it back pretty badly if you catch my drift. Wow, right here in Schomburg Cove. Wait a minute. What about me? Ugh-- ow-- he held me at gunpoint. Fortrell's, I doubt it has a license. It's empty. You forced me to cook for you. George, he forced me to cook for him. I did-- I didn't force. I said "please." Killer omelette. - That's it. Out. Out of my house. It's been real. You know what? I don't care about Russell, Benny, statues, Greece. Just leave, please. I was hoping that I could spend the night. Wh-- I'll just let the two of you work that one out. Goodnight, Ms. McAllister. George. Spend the night? - Fortrell is-- Are you mad? --on his way back from Greece, and he's due here any minute. You don't know me-- Well, let's keep it that way. I am not leaving until I apprehend him. Now, why don't I rent out a room? You have a sign up front saying there's a vacancy. Over my dead body. 500 500 bucks a night. Read my lips-- no. NANCY (ON PHONE): You said "no?" Nancy, he did B and E. NANCY (ON PHONE): After the way you described him, let him do the whole alphabet. Come on Sara, take a chance. Take off the clothes you're wearing right now, put on something sexy, invite him in and fluff up his pillow. Now. Tomorrow we'll do your hair. In the meantime, don't let him out of your sight. Tomorrow he'll have Russel-- Benny, whatever. He'll be good riddance, still a lying cad. To think I cooked for him. NANCY (ON PHONE): What's he doing right now? SARA: How on Earth would I know? [doorbell ringing] SARA: He's got more nerve than a rooster in a hen house. This better not be you, Flynn. Don't even think I'm going to fix you coffee and breakfast. Coming. Nigel. Hi. [car honking] I'll be fast, 'cause Corinne's waiting for me. The little misses. Flynn? Uh, Sara, here's the deal, all right? Uh, all houses are, well, you know, endless money pits. Now, you've given it your all, in honor of your late parents, but it is destroying you. Let me buy it from you. - What? Yeah-- I'd be doing you a favor, if you think about it. Right, like the favor you did me when you found out my parents didn't leave me any money. That was a long time ago-- What do you call that favor, Nigel? Liberating me from our engagement. Gee, you're a living saint. This is not very produc-- Saint Nigel, the Benevolent. Let's not get bitchy. [car honking] Come on. We need the extra room. And, well, Corinne's got her heart set on putting little swings here where this old spruce is. My grandfather planted that spruce. Tell Corinne she can kiss my-- FLYNN: Sara! Darling. Sara. Sara. The neighbors! Don't mean to be rude, old man, but you've caught us in an inconvenient time. Well, I'll-- then-- I'll-- I'll-- come back at-- at, uh-- later. Why did you do that to Nigel? This whole town is gonna be talking. He was in my way. I'm tired. I need a-- a shower. I need a cup of coffee. I need a bed! What does this look like, the Y? Look, I heard you talking. I know you need the money. Let's make a deal-- if you let me stay here to catch Fortrell, I'll make you my associate. We'll split the bounty. How much? Let's put it this way, you won't have to worry about your mortgage, ever. A spruce tree. How do I know I can trust you? There's only one thing that follows a man throughout his life-- his word. You can trust me, Sara. Ooh, how about this? Wear this. That's underwear. That's what people wear on dates now. Look at Madonna. This isn't a date. It's dinner. It's business. It's close enough. Ooh, how about this? We're going to be discussing strategy, important bus-- Oh, no. Not these shoes. You're going to look like you write English detective novels. Sensible shoes? Ugh. Nobody notices shoes. Besides, "must be aware of unintentional sexual messages--" Oh, Sara, for once in your life, take a chance. Go for it. You don't always have to be Ms. Responsibility. I mean, this time let somebody else balance their checkbook right to the penny, or mow their lawn on exactly the seventh day, or-- or install their summer screens-- I'm already a week late on my summer screens, thank you. And what? Did the world come to an end? Did you read in the paper, "Sara McCallister a Week Late on Her Summer Screens. Photograph on Page 3?" Huh? No. Everybody else gets to have fun. Why not you? - I think maybe this blue dress. - Ugh. You're going to look like a nun on her day off. At least belt it. Belts make me look fat. I give up. Ugh. OK, you're right. I'll belt it. Walk on the wild side. Woo! [doorbell ringing] - He's here. Don't worry. Dress. I'll go. Ow. Hi. Are you OK? You must be Flynn. I'm Sara. No, I'm not. I'm Nancy. Sara's on her way downstairs. Can I get you anything? Uh, no. That's-- that's OK. I'll just, uh, wait. Oh, well yeah. Come in. You know, I just want to say-- well, this may be presumptuous, but, um, Sara's such a good person. She's decent and sweet and-- well, what, exactly, are your plans? You mean, are my intentions honorable? Well, I just don't want her to get hurt. Oh, I didn't realize that dinner was such a high-risk activity. Except those little chicken bones. Gotta watch those. Is this Sara? A little baby fat. Hmm. Well, that was years ago. And this is her with her parents. This was just before her first big piano recital-- her first and last. Yeah, what happened with that? She would-- she wouldn't play for me the other night. Oh, well, she, um-- she bombed on stage. I mean, it wasn't really her fault. Her parents were just so overprotective. They never really gave her a chance to prove anything on her own, so that night-- I mean, there she was, the biggest night of her life, and she froze in front of everyone. It was a total disaster. And that was it. Never again. You know, in fact, I've heard her play. She's great. Lucky you. Look, Mr. Flynn-- Just Flynn. You don't come from here, and you won't end up here, but we do. Where you come from, that-- that glamorous "jetset-y," "bounter-y" "hunter-y" kind of world, you don't know girls like Sara. She's good on the inside. You know, she-- she has integrity. She's-- she's sensitive in a way a guy like you would never understand. Hey, hey, Dr. Freud, obviously who and what I am is an open book to you, but don't lose any sleep over me, OK? Th-- those homespun qualities that you mentioned? Not my type. Zippo. You want to know what my intentions are? I'm going to catch my man, and then I'm history. Got it? - Take it off. - What? - The belt. - Why? - Just do it. - But you said that-- I know, I know. I made a mistake. He's not the one you want to wear a belt for. He's not for you. You mean I'm not good enough. You took one look at him and realized. FLYNN: Hey, up there, we have a job to do. All I want to do is keep you from getting hurt. Don't you understand? Too well. Oh, you dressed. You-- Nice shoes. Sensible. So, you mentioned dinner? FLYNN: Welcome to the glamorous world of bounty hunting. SARA: I love this old wharf. It's been for sale for as long as I can remember. So, what's our game plan? How come we're out here? I figured Fortrell is either headed back to your house or here. You see that story facility? Depending on how cautious he is, he'll either store it or keep it with him. Wow. How did you figure all that out? I, uh-- well, I-- ha-- found this invoice in his garbage. I could have done that. So this is what he stole. That is a panel from the Constantinos Hoard in Cyprus, which means that it's a fresh dig, no provenance. [throat clearing] Ca-- Can I have the English translation? The operative words are "priceless" and "stolen." There he is. I can't believe it, quiet little Russell Lafleur-- thief. How do you know he's even going to come back? He'll come back. Too many people would be suspicious, especially in a small town. I'll say. And plus, he left his gun behind. If he wasn't planning on returning, he would have ditched it. Hey, what if he's back at the house right now? We've got it wired for sound. We'd get him before he could change into his socks. So you're a high-tech Dick. A high-tech Dick. So, now what? Now? Nothing. This is a stakeout, Sara. Now we wait. Spread your legs. What? In your dreams! Ex-- Excuse me. Mm? I, uh-- I thought maybe you might be thirsty? Sorry. You want to open it? Woo. Sorry. I didn't know your work was this exciting. It can be, it's just your lucky night. What's that supposed to mean? You're not exactly the gutsy type. Oh, and you know my type, huh? I was gutsy once. Oh, yeah? When? When I was eight. I just learned how to ride a bike and my parents, they would only let me ride in the front yard while they watched. But one day I chased a fire engine all the way past the radio tower outside of town. That must be about five miles from your house. 5 and 6/10 each way. Why? That's a lot of pedaling for a little girl. Fire engines were my weakness. I'd hear them and think about it, the danger, excitement. That day, I just couldn't help myself. Off I went, no turning back. That was a long time ago. Fortell's not coming, let's go back. Thank you. So, your room's beside Russell's-- I-- I-- I mean Benny. When he comes back, I'll be waiting. Goodnight, Sara. Flynn, you want to come in? Go on inside, Sara. I-- I've already decided that I-- I'm not going to kiss you goodnight. Nerve! "I've already decided I'm not kissing you." Well, who asked you? All the stinking nerve. Arrogant. Creep. Jerk. [electric toothbrush] Jerk. If you were the last person on a desert island, begging me, I wouldn't kiss you. Flynn. Mm, Flynn. Flynn. Just shoot me. [car approaching] Oh, Benny. Ah, key, key. Where is it? Ah, uh, uh. (WHISPERING) He's coming. Flynn. Flynn, wake up. - You're under arrest! - It's me. Stop, he's coming. - What are you doing? Russell-- I mean-- I mean Benny. Damn it! Ow, ow! Get up, get up. Come on! Hurry! - Handcuffed. You handcuffed me. Where's the key? The key? - Come on, get it. - I see it. He's getting away. [muffled speaking] FLYNN: Go, go, go. Go, go, go. SARA: Ow! FLYNN: Damn it, he's getting away! SARA: Watch it. [falling down stairs] SARA: That's Benny, he's getting away. Ow, why'd you handcuff me? FLYNN: Whose fault is that? SARA: Whose handcuffs are they? FLYNN: Who came barreling in here where she didn't belong? Who forgot to tell his partner her part in the plan? What plan? There's no plan, it's just me. So give me the key. Now. No plan, you were lying? Look, I am not discussing this now. You lied to me! Give me the key. This isn't a game. Ow! Unlike that blather about "one thing that follows a man around for the rest of his life." Give me that key. I have a job to do. Y-- You don't belong me. I am going with you. Stop acting crazy, Sara. Just stay here in your little town where you belong-- ow-- and finish changing your window screens. You're too old to be chasing fire trucks. We had a deal, Flynn. You said you were a man of your word. Are you? Get in the car. SARA: Nelly, the speed limit's only 30 around here. [music playing] Flynn? Flynn? Flynn? Flynn! Flynn! Flynn! I thought you ditched me. Those tranquilizers wear off, dear? We let her We let her out once a month. Nice shoes. Try these on. They should fit. You bought me new clothes? In a matter of hours, we're going to be in the office of the world's authority on the contents of the Constantinos Hoard. If we are lucky, he will let us know which collector is buying these artifacts. Now that is where Benny is going with the panel. How do you know this stuff? Well, it's my job, ma'am. Besides, once you get out of the boonies like Schomburg Cove, Dr. Hamilton-Ives happens to be relatively famous. And you want me to wear this? As opposed to what? Hey, that's brand new. What are you doing? Exactly. You're an archaeologist. We've been on a dig in Greece, and have made contact with Turkish grave robbers who will supply us with the stolen antiquities from the Constantinos Hoard. For the right buyer, of course. [MUSIC PLAYING - COLIN JAMES, "KEEP ON LOVIN' ME BABY"] COLIN JAMES (SINGING): Well, I want you to love me. Well, I want you to love me. Well, I want you to love me. Naturally, a find like the Constantinos Hoard doesn't turn up every day. We have been hearing rumors of more activity with it. And, uh, what about provenance? Can your advisors provide the legal documentation? You're testing us, Dr. Hamilton-Ives. You know this dig is fresh. There are no documents, because Greece doesn't allow these items out of the country-- not legally. If your collector has a problem with this, then perhaps we should go elsewhere. No, no. I assure you you've come to the right place. My collector has assembled all the known pieces of the Constantinos Hoard. It's become something of an obsession with him. If you have access to more, I can assure you he'll want to meet you. Why don't we discuss this further in my office? (WHISPERING) Sara. Sara. I have a feeling you would like to take a souvenir home? Extraordinary piece. DR. HAMILTON-IVES: Yes, they are beautiful, aren't they? SARA: The collector is John Charles Alford? Milk-toast Russell hangs out with John Charles Alford? Fortrell is no milk-toast if he's dealing with Alford. He's swimming with the meanest of sharks, Sara. Do not underestimate him. A shark? Zillionaire philanthropist John Charles Alford is a shark? And there there's no Santa Claus either. That way. Now what? Now we have less than two days to beat Fortrell to Miami, headquarters to John Charles Alford. Two days? We'll be there by dinner if we make the next flight. No planes. What? There's one every hour from-- This is not negotiable. Come on. What, are you afraid to fly? Maybe you could say it a little louder. I don't think everybody heard you. Mr. no nonsense, tough as nails, Mr. I'm so perfect-- Could you-- could you stop this. --is afraid to fly. Well, let's hit the road then. FLYNN: Has anyone ever told you you have a little mean streak in you? Why don't you let me drive? I've never driven a Corvette before. In your dreams. It so happens I won the defensive driver award in my driver's training class, and I've never been in any sort of accident. Oh, then the odds are against you, and you're an accident waiting to happen. Trust me, it is not going to happen in this car. This car is my family. - Don't be rude. This is a thing. Family is real. [whistle] Suit yourself. [MUSIC PLAYING - COLIN JAMES, "KEEP ON LOVIN' ME BABY"] COLIN JAMES (SINGING): Well, I want you to kiss me. Whoa, yeah. Whoa, yeah. Whoa, baby. You know what pleases me. You know what pleases me. Early in the morning. Flynn! I hate to break it to you, but you almost just crashed your family. OK, you drive. We'll make better time. Don't make jokes about something you don't understand. [MUSIC PLAYING - COLIN JAMES, "KEEP ON LOVIN' ME BABY"] COLIN JAMES (SINGING): You know what pleases me. You know what pleases me. Early in the morning, or any time at night, well, I can feel your tender lips making me feel all right. You know it pleases me. Oops. Just don't let it be the oil pan. Ugh. TOW TRUCK DRIVER (INTO RADIO): Johnny, I'm looking for an oil pan for a Corvette. Sure, I'll wait. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Flynn, please. I'm so sorry, just-- You can stop that anytime now. Why don't you just yell, get mad, say something. I found the part. I can fix it up by seven-- that's AM. See? Life goes on. Yeah, life goes on. Let's just ride it where it takes us. Is that what you want, Sara? To ride it? Sure. Why not? Then you have to ask for it. That's rule number one in getting what you want, you get to ask. Are you trying to scare me, Flynn? Are you scared, Sara? What's there to be scared of? You're a white picket fence kind of girl. You like words like "commitment" and "forever," nice, safe words. Well, I don't know those words. And when I see a white fence I just want to burn it down. It's the fire that scares you. Maybe you're the one that's scared, Flynn. And all that fire is just a smokescreen. But if you're mad about your car, you should just say so. It's not nice to manipulate people. Hi. I never said that I wasn't close to my family. Well, technically, you said your car was your family, which might suggest-- Which might suggest that there are certain topics that are off limits in the course of idle chitchat. You're right, Flynn. I'm sorry. I just thought I could get to know you. I was hoping we could be friends. I'm sorry, I'm tired. It's OK, it's-- it's my fault. FLYNN: My dad was one of the first casualties in Vietnam. You don't have to tell me. I barely remember him. I was just a kid. I remember my mom crying, though. And when she pulled herself together, she took a job. And she used to work all the time, but there was never enough money. One Christmas, I remember complaining because I only got a pair of shoes and everybody else got bikes-- whatever. So the next year, she-- she took on a second job so we could have a real Christmas. It was a night job in a bar. The last thing that-- that she would say was, leave the light on for me, kiddo. It was-- It was kind of our own private joke, you know, since it was me that was afraid of the dark. And, uh, one night, there was a fight in the bar. They broke it up, but the guy came back with a gun and-- just one of those flukes, she got in the way. Story of my life. Flynn, I want to spend the night with you. On your terms, not mine. No safe words, no picket fences, just the fire. [music playing] You're so beautiful, Sara. You're so beautiful. You don't even know. Mm. You're still here. I thought I dreamt you. Don't go yet. FLYNN: Get dressed, Sara, it's morning. Flynn what happened last night wasn't just physical. I know you were hurt as a child, but-- FLYNN: Don't psychoanalyze me. I-- I have been pitched by more savvy women than you, and it doesn't-- here, I'll cut to the chase, OK? I'm afraid of intimacy. I admit it. Happy? Point is, I'm going to stay afraid, so save your speech, because I'm not going to change. I'll wait. $350. Yeah. FLYNN: Nice doing business with you. No, no, better. NANCY (ON PHONE): Tell me you didn't just tell me that. I'm in love with him, Nance. And he's in love too, he just doesn't know it. He eats women's hearts for breakfast, Sara, and you got naked with him? How was it? I don't kiss and tell. FLYNN: Come on, Sara. Let's go. Look, he's waiting. I gotta go. Um, I just wanted you to know I'm OK. No, you're not OK, Sara. I mean, besides having a broken heart waiting to happen, Nigel is foreclosing on your house. You've got to get back here. Tell Nigel all I need is 24 hours. We'll nab Benny Fortrell and-- [car horn] --Flynn will have come to his senses. Wish me luck. Don't do it, Sara. SARA (ON PHONE): Bye, Nance. SARA: When are we stopping? I'm starving. FLYNN: Grab a candy bar, clock's ticking. SARA: If we had flown, we wouldn't even be having this conversation. FLYNN: Whine all you want, I'm not stopping. FLYNN: Stop looking at me like you're waiting to talk about feelings. What? I'm just sitting here, minding my own business, eating my breakfast. Well, hurry up. We have to make Miami today. Gulping one's food isn't good for digestion. Boy, are a grump in the morning. Sara, the bounty runs out in exactly 15 hours. I'm not here for some romp to break up the monotony of my life. Is that why you think I came? To break up the monotony of my life? Let me tell you something, I came because-- because something snapped. Like something, some force was suddenly going to keep me from dying of acute responsibility. Here lies Sara McCallister, always did the right thing. No, Flynn. You came along and-- it was fate. I'm nobody's fate. [music playing - "la bamba"] Just the lady. Stay, wait for me. - I don't want-- This time you are listening to me. We're not even registered. I-- I can't just hang out, I mean, look at me. Pretend you're the gardener. - Right, I'm-- - Out. Stay here. I'll be back. Hurry. [music playing - "la bamba"] FLYNN: It's showtime. Let's go. No time for jokes. Put this on. Where exactly would you have me put this on? Right here in the lobby, where I've been waiting for you for two hours. HOTEL EMPLOYEE: Mr. Arnold, your room key, sir. FLYNN: Thank you. HOTEL EMPLOYEE: Thank you, sir. Happy? Who's Mr. Arnold? FLYNN: Your husband, Mrs. Arnold. You are Susan Arnold, and you are extraordinarily rich, but you're even more private than rich. You don't even look like you. One hour, the Arnolds are meeting John Charles Alford. We have been investing in antiquities, and have heard the rumors of the Constantinos Hoard. We want it at any price. You let me do the talking. Now get ready. I'm sure the clothes will fit. Did you lose your personality back out on the highway? [door slam] You're being a real jerk. SARA: I'm sure the clothes will fit. So arrogant. [knocking] Go away, I'm not ready yet. [knocking] Extremely rude. Five minutes to dress. Mrs. Arnold, I'm here to do your hair. Just one last touch and then-- perfect. Voila! Come on, let's have a look at you. Oh, Mrs. Arnold, you look lovely. You know, that suit fits you perfectly. It's time. Why did you throw these away? All they need is a little washing. You won't be needing them. Well, I can't exactly wear this suit for the next three days. Not that it isn't the most beautiful thing I've ever worn in my whole life, even though you haven't noticed. You don't get it, do you? It's over. We're this far from Fortrell now. Which means that you're this far from getting on a plane and going back to your life-- your house, your windows, your picket fence. Now, come on. We've got less than eight hours before the bounty runs out. You ready? Do you have your story down? Just let me do the talking. I can't do this, Flynn. Are you in or out, Sara? I can't think straight. Just stop it. But last night, I know that means something. Would you make up your mind-- in or out? I have told you my terms. If you can't accept-- Then I quit. Right now. My terms. This is my job, Sara. This is the eleventh hour. How can you think about a job? This is your life. You are about to-- The whole thing is hopeless. I mean, think about it. If the Arnolds are so extraordinarily rich, then Alford is going to know them socially. This is a stupid plan, Flynn. Alford knows about them because of the DEA, who spent years inventing this cover. DEA, as in Drug Enforcement Agency? I thought this was about antiquities. John Charles Alford is Juan Carlos Alfonso. He's the banker to Medellin and Cali drug cartels. He launders their money, Sara, which is why this is about antiquities. They are very expensive, they tend to be untraceable, and they're only semi-legal to begin with. This is not a game, Sara, so are you in or are you out? Mr. And Mrs. Arnold, how nice to meet you at last. I've heard so much about you. Mr. Alford. Please, call me John. I hope you don't mind the informality. I prefer it. This is my wife, Susan. Susan, say hello to Mr. Alford-- John. You OK, Susan? You seem a little-- (BRITISH ACCENT) It's just Miami-- I'm not terribly fond of the city. Although I mean no offense. No offense taken. I'm not a native, myself. Let's go into my office. Straight ahead, this way. (BRITISH ACCENT) If you don't mind, I would like to wash my hands. Cities, you know, so unclean. Yes, of course. My secretary will show you the way. Meanwhile, Guthrie, why don't you join me in my office? I understand we have much to discuss. [phone ringing] SECRETARY: Ah, Mr. Fortrell, how was your trip? No, I'm sorry, he just stepped into a meeting. But I will let him know that you're in the city. And you're staying at your usual hotel? OK, bye-bye. Ah, there you are. I trust you're feeling better. Your husband has been telling me about your collection of antiquities. I must say, I am very impressed. It's not often that one meets a kindred spirit. (BRITISH ACCENT) Yes, sometimes it happens only once in a lifetime-- finding a kindred spirit, I mean. JOHN CHARLES ALFORD: Yes, I know. And yet, that puts us in the regrettable position of desiring the same thing. I understand you're here because of my passion for the Constantinos Hoard. I bet you'd just love to see the collection, wouldn't you? (BRITISH ACCENT) Well-- Absolutely. Would be an honor. It would be my pleasure. Please, follow me. Please, this way. Constantinos Hoard. These are, perhaps, the finest antiquities to come out of Greece. This is definitely what we have come for. Oh, unfortunately, it's not for sale. Oh, I beg to differ. Everything is for sale. Yes, well-- As long as the collection is complete. I understand that there is another piece that has been discovered. Mr. Alford, if that's everything, I'll be leaving for the evening. Your messages. Yes, the new panel will be here tomorrow. Remarkable detective skills you people have. This altitude, John, our world is very small. When, exactly, can I see it? (BRITISH ACCENT) Really, Guthrie, Mr. Alford says his collection isn't for sale. I don't believe you should press it. - Well, actually-- - (BRITISH ACCENT) No, no. You've made yourself clear, and we are being crass by pressing it. I-- I can explain. Susan! (BRITISH ACCENT) Yes, Guthrie, do explain. I'll wait for you by the lift. Good evening, Mr. Alford. Good evening. Forgive her. Cities-- puts her on edge. Just give me a moment with her. FLYNN: (WHISPERED) Sara. Have you lost your mind? I've been on Fortrell's trail for six months. I'm on the brink of closing this case, finding Fortrell-- We've got it. Let's get out of here. What? Fortrell is here. You are brilliant. You are amazing. I've never been so scared in my life. "I'll wait for you by the lift." Where did you get that? In a book. Where else? So what's with the DEA and how did you know about Alford and Arnold and-- I-- I helped invent them. For-- for 10 years, I was Special Agent John Flynn with the US Drug Enforcement Agency. Where do you think I was all morning? Shopping for me? Trading information with the local office. It's amazing. You are amazing. Is Fortrell there? FLYNN: Nope. Now what? Remember the stakeout, Sara? Ugh, man, that is so boring. There's got to be a better way to find out where he is. Yeah, well, I left my crystal ball at home. What are you doing? Flynn, there are some things I'm going to be much better at than you. (NEW YORK ACCENT) Benny Fortrell told me you'd know where I could find him. He said all I had to do was ask. Yeah, and, uh, who are you? His landlady, who do you think? I'm looking for back rent. You know Blackjack's, over on Bay? Be Sure. That's where he'll be tonight. Oh, man. Ugh. Flynn. I have the most gigantic favor to ask. Oh, sorry. That's OK. Did you say something? There's just this one spot in the middle of my back. Funny how our bodies are designed-- almost perfectly, you know? 99 percent. But then we have these arms that don't quite reach the middle of our back. One teeny little design flaw. Crazy, isn't it? Don't stop. Your plane leaves tonight. What plane? The one I just reserved your seat in. I'm borrowing one of your shirts. You can have it-- a memento. I'm going with you to Blackjack's. Right. It's a solo game from here on. Someone's got to peel you off the floor when you get shot. We are not having this conversation. Don't be so stubborn. You need me to ID him. Somehow, I have managed without you all these years. Yeah, well, in your photo, Benny has a beard. He doesn't happen to have one now. I know what he looks like. Sara, you are not coming, period. If you don't take me, I'll follow you in a taxi. I'm down to the wire on this one. The bounty runs out at midnight. And either I have him by then, or it's gotten pretty messy. Now please, Sarah, I-- that's something that I don't want you to see. Do you understand? For us, whatever us is. We ID Fortrell, and then you go. Agreed? Agreed. [MUSIC PLAYING - "MAN SMART (WOMAN SMARTER)"] PIANOMAN (SINGING): To find out which one is smarter. Some say men, but I say no. So what do I do? Nothing. Come on, Flynn. OK, you have two jobs-- stay out of the way and find Fortrell. And don't act like a girl. Technically, that's three things. Evening, folks. What can I get you? Hi, uh, bourbon neat. White wi-- whiskey, with, you know, cubes. On the rocks. Uh-huh. I knew that. Do you see him. No. Bourbon, and one white whiskey. PIANOMAN: Eleven o'clock, almost quitting hour, folks. But I've got time for one more tune. Just send that request on a brand new $20 bill, and I'll do whatever you want to here. Oh, no, no, I ain't doing that. Sara, you promised. Stay here. PIANOMAN: Oh, that's not bad. What do y'all think about that one? [inaudible] OK, well, listen. What kind of music you been listening to-- I've got to find a way to get past that bouncer. - Let me. - No. Well, maybe I can distract him. - No, no, no, we had a deal. - "Yesterday." "Yesterday." GUS: Play "Come a Little Bit Closer." "Come a Little Bit Closer." Gus, you know I don't play "Come a Little Bit Closer." GUS: Come on, man, you know it's my favorite song. I know it's your favorite song. Every night, Gus, you want me to play "Come a Little Bit Closer." "Come a Little Bit Closer" just one time, please. I know, I know it's your favorite song. You gotta be crazy, I ain't playing that. I can do "Come a Little Bit Closer." FLYNN: Sara. Sara. But only if you'll join me. PIANOMAN: Looks like we have a volunteer. What do you say, folks? - Are you crazy? I must be. I barely know the song. PIANOMAN: Right this way. I've been keeping the bench warm for you. Don't mind them, they're just a little young and restless. You know how it is. Don't be nervous, darling. You'll be fine, just fine. Now sit yourself down. That's right. Now you go get them, girl. [MUSIC PLAYING - "COME A LITTLE BIT CLOSER"] Mm-mm. AUDIENCE WOMAN: A little more heat, honey. A little more heat. (SINGING) In a little cafe just the other side of the border. She was sitting there giving me looks that make my mouth water. So I started walking her way. She belonged to that man, Jose. And I knew, yes, I knew I should leave, but I heard her say-- yeah, yeah-- come a little bit closer. You're my kind of man, so big and so strong. Come a little bit closer. I'm all alone, and the night is so long. GUS: [chicken noises] Sing it to me. SARA (SINGING): Then the music stopped. When I looked, the cafe was empty. Then I heard Jose say, "Man, you know you're in trouble plenty." So I dropped-- FLYNN: Hey! SARA (SINGING): --the drink from my hand, and through-- Hold it, Fortrell. Yeah, what are you going to do, shoot me? Don't tempt me. You've got less than an hour left, then your bounty's up. What do you want to talk about, sports or music? Hands on the roof. Like this? What you going to do now, mister bounty hunter? Sara, I told you to get out of here. You want me to get out of here? We had a deal. Do you ever hold up your end of a deal? I happen to be extremely conscientious, as a matter of fact. Then get of here! SARA: Oh, OK. Now? You want me to go now? Right now? Right after I just saved you're butt? You didn't save my butt. Stop it, just stop it. Move. Back off. Move now. Go on. Back off. [MUSIC PLAYING - 54 40, "INSIDE THE HORN"] 54-40 (SINGING): Here we go. Not a bad idea, Ms. McCallister. This is irre-- really irresponsible of you. Open your eyes! Open them! Ooh-ooh, this is fast. 54-40 (SINGING): Inside my head, I see a lady. Completely numb from the shock of war. Wondering when if it's raining. I gotta get you. Gotta get you. I got to get you home. I gotta get you. We lost him. 54-40 (SINGING): Gotta get you. I got to get you home. They say with love comes a bolder force. Make a life more worth saving. I could taker her out and set her free. FORTRELL: So you want to play chicken, huh? 54-40 (SINGING): With her eyes in play she beckons me. You take my place. I'll take yours. FORTRELL: Ahh! Flynn! [crime scene noises] POLICE OFFICER: Here it is. Better call the boys from the DEA over. REPORTER: Benny, you got any comments? Benny, how do you feel now that you got caught? What'd you have, Benny, drugs? DEA OFFICER: What do we got here, 10 million dollar pizza? Drug game's not like it used to be. Hey, guys, here it is. Imagine laundering money this way. We keep looking for suitcases of greenbacks, the cartel keeps finding new ways of getting the money out. This is unique. I don't know what all the fuss is about. This just looks like a piece from my folks' back yard. Isn't that something? Here, take care of that. I'll be back in a minute. Well, congratulations, Flynn. The boys at the agency were taking bets you wouldn't pull this one off, but, uh, this was just wired in from Athens. That's nice. Looks like the Greeks had a little more faith in you than we did. They paying you that much for a piece of plaster? That's not plaster, it's history. Big difference. Apparently. OK? SARA: See, you just tie the short end over like that. Jeez, yeah, you could be an honorary paramedic. Can I steal you patient yet? Oh, she's healthier than we are. You take care, Sara. Thanks. You feeling all right? Yeah, just some bruises. You were pretty terrific, Flynn. You almost killed yourself to save that panel. It wasn't the panel I was trying to save. Here, this is for you. Flynn, this could buy me three houses. Yeah, well I-- I let them know that I have some information about the rest of the Constantinos Hoard. And Greece is very serious about their history. Take it. You earned it. They've, uh-- they've offered to, uh, fly you home in their private jet. I know you like champagne. Flynn-- Don't say it, Sara. We're partners. We should be together. - You know me and flying. Don't make jokes. Do you remember when I-- I told you that the first rule of getting what you want is asking for it? The second was asking for the right thing. It isn't me. Don't do this. Don't tell me that I'm not good enough. That's not what I'm saying. It's not you. Sara. Go home. Live your life. Look at you. You don't need me. You're going to be all right on your own. I know that, Flynn. But what about you? MAN: Go, break it up. There's nothing to see. FLYNN: She's ready to go. [music playing] So was he really tall, dark, and handsome? Everybody's talking. Can I just make a deposit, please. Everybody's right. Thank goodness you are back. What on Earth where you thinking of, going off with that-- that-- that-- "Man," I believe is the operative word here, Nigel. Man. Don't get flip, Sara. I'm just thinking about your reputation. And for a woman on her own-- Do we actually have something to discuss here? Like how you tried to foreclose on my house while I was gone. That's not a done deal. But maybe in the future you're going to thank me for that. For the time being, I'm just glad that the Sara we know and love is-- You know what? You never knew me, and heaven knows you never loved me. Adios, Nigel. Hey, hey, what about your house? I'll call you. Give my best to the misses. NANCY: I told you he'd break your heart. Well, you'll never see him again. SARA: He didn't break my heart, Nancy. I did it for myself. Wait a sec. Why do we always stop here? Is it some kind of secret ritual? I like the view, so shoot me. [laughter] A little late on those windows, aren't you, Sara? Who's there? [baby crying] I'm looking for Sara. Doesn't she live here anymore? I wish. Try the wharf. CORINNE: Can you get in here? I need your help. I'm coming, Corinne. CORINNE: I can't change them both at the same time. NIGEL: Yeah-- just change one of them then. [MUSIC PLAYING - "THE LIES OF HANDSOME MEN"] SARA (SINGING): I believe in witchcraft. And I believe in Cinderella. I believe in Gypsies. And I believe I cast a spell that's sent into the sky. 'Cause I believe the lies of handsome men. Sometimes, in a dark and quiet place, the truth and I meet face to face. But even though his highness disappears, I keep some stunning souvenirs. So I believe in heroes. And I expect that happy ending. Wishing on some rainbow, I pretend he's not pretending. Someday I'll get wise, but right now, I need the lies of handsome men. SARA: Thank you. A friend of mine once told me the secrets to getting what you want. He said, you have to be brave enough to ask for it, you have to be persistent, and you have to ask for the right thing. If you follow these three secrets, then what you want might just walk through your front door. Well, folks, the best thing about owning your own club is you get to take a break whenever you want. I think people are staring. It's a small town, you'll get used to it. I love you, Sara. I know you do, Flynn. It took me a while to work out how to say it. It's a long winter. We have lots of time to work out the kinks. By the way, I love you too. [MUSIC PLAYING - "THE LIES OF HANDSOME MEN"] SARA (SINGING): I believe in star signs. And I believe in film romances. I believe in fantasy. And I believe with just one glance he's crazy for my eyes. 'Cause I believe the lies of handsome men. I believe in witchcraft. And I believe in Cinderella. I believe in Gypsies. And I believe--
