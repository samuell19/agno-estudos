Sir, can we talk? I don't have much time now. Let me tell you this. To make it short. My husband worked in the Red Cross as a sanitary inspector.. Then one day... I don't know why, but... someone intruded into his office. Since that day, I did not see him any further. Now I don't cry. I'm broke. I can't pay for my daughter's college. Sir, my daughter is my big help. My daughter is a heavenly creature. She is 15 years old and very polite. She likes to be a nurse. I believe that she will succeed. Sir, it's a great assumption. To believe in it, like you do. Execuse me, madam, perhaps I didn't understand. I want to hand my daughter over to you. Madame... Look at her. She came with me, look right there. She's wearing yellow. You can see she's poor like everybody in this country.- She doesn't have much chance to escape from it. I take her everywhere I go. They would kill me to get her, I don't want to die, but I can't leave her. Can't leave her. I'm begging you, Sir Take her with you. I can't do so. Reconsider. Look, Sir. The good and the bad are mingled. But each wears a mask. wszystko w porz?dku? Doskonale. Don't hesitate to ask for anything. It's our cook, Denise. - Good morning, Denise. - Good morning, Madam. We serve cold beverages. Good, thanks. Denise, help the lady. Do you need anything, Madam? No, thank you. Hey. Do you still remember me? Certainly. How long are you here? I've just arrived. - Are you alone? - Yes. So you use your Visa a little, don't you? Yes, I do. Sorry, I must go. Later. Ellen, how about dinner tonight? - OK. - See you later. Thanks. - Did you eat? - I'm hungry. A sandwich? - Two. - Two sandwiches. What beverages? - Do you want Coke or soda? - Soda. Coke and soda, please. We'll take Coke, soda and two sandwiches. Hello, Sue, do you like the weather today? Very much. - Verry sunny. - That's why I encamp. Sure she's got tough skin. Sue is a lumber jack. A good strapping girl from the north. How can you be so mean. She's a really nice girl. Sure she is Did I ever say on the contrary? You are really taking care of her. Unfortunately, I have to. It's flattering for me, I guess. Do you find me fat? I'm not guilty. I like women who pay me. Next man talking about women... Don't start. As always, you now how to flatter. Did you believe me? Hope is opium for the people. A ritch woman is interested in certain men. You are very polite and ritch. I didn't mean that. I don't want to be fat. - You are jelous. - Jelous? It's funny. I don't want to catch myself on thinking about fatness. I assure you that, before Rubens, fat was a sign of sickness. He ended up in museums. Before what? Rubens, a Flemish painter. He painted fat belly, fat thighs... I would like it. Take a look around, my dear. You've got everything you want right here. - Sue? - Yes? Do you want to hear something? No, no, nothing. Stop, I don't fancy her. I know, I'm terribly unfair. I just can't imagine you in bed with her. When does she leave? I think Saturday. Ah, our meal. Thanks. Take it. What is this? A German woman gave it to me. I don't care. Do you think it's nice? Certainly, very nice. You're the one here who's nice. Hello. - Hi. - You're a new guest? Come and sit down. You just got here? About two hours ago. Where are you from? Savannah, Georgia. And my name is Brenda. - Oh, hello, Brenda, I'm Ellen. Nice to know you. - You too. Let me introduce you... - Jessica from London... - Hi. and our young friends Chico, Eddie and Ekbar. - Did you come alone? - Yes. Well, welcome to paradise. You're gonna have a ball. Actually, I already know the place. I was here before. Really? Yeah, but three years ago. Three years ago? I don't remember. It was in September. Ah, that's why. BRENDA The first time I came it was with Mark, my husband. It all started when Mark took pity on this young boy who hadn't eaten two days. Invited him to eat at our table. I bet he wasn't too happy about it. The boy didn't look a day over 15. I especially noticed his pretty smile. Mark told him he could order anything he wanted. You should have seen him. I never saw anyone eat so much in my life. When he left, Mark said: "he's a nice young fellow". Day after day, we started having all our meals with him. At that time, he was very shy. We spent hours with him, discussing his life, his family, his future. He was in school then. We kind of adopted him. And he seemed to have taken that for granted too. One day I... It's like just he comes swimming with me. He took me to a secluded beach. We were both lying in our bathing suits on a big rock, basking in the sun. His body fascinated me. Long, light, musclar. Skin glistened. I couldn't take my eyes off him. And the later I got the more I was losing my mind he was lying there beside me, his eyes were shut. I remember every move as if it was yesterday. I edged my hand over and placed it on his chest. The boy opened his eyes and immediately closed them again. That encouraged me. And I moved my hand down his body. Such soft, young skin... He was motionless. Then, I... slipped two fingers into his bathing suit and touched his cock. Almost immediately it starded getting hard, growing in the palm of my hand until it just poped out. The his arms were beside his body. He breathed faitly, but very regurarly. I looked around to see if no one was coming. And I threw myself on him. I literarly threw myself on him. It was so violent, I couldn't help but scream. I think I never stopped screaming. It was my first orgasm. I was 45. He opened his eyes. He was exhausted too. Shy and afraid. I kissed him all over. I was crying. No, no. No, Jeremy. Take care of my horse if you want to do something. I will take care of Jeremy. Let me take it, I tied it. OK, I know how to do it. If you're tired let me know. No. You go all the way when you invite us. All the way. Come on, take it. No, I'm afraid that I'll get sick. Give it to me. - It's strong. - Ah, OK. But it was courageous. Another one. Go for it. - Do you want it? - No. I will smoke. No, you? You're much too young. No, no, no. Here. We were having fun. Why is it over now? Devil's nature. Are you going for a swim? I don't know what I was thinking. I was a child. Oh, come with others. Nothing to worry about. Here everything is different. - We don't know you were yet, my dear. - You will see. C'mon, Ellen. I'm sure in this room there are lots of men that attracted to you. No, I'm telling you. They aren't the least bit of horny. When I see them on the beach, they remind me of the big white whales wallowing in the sand.. More red than white, in fact. The red whales can't be horny, don't they? If you're over 40 and not as dumb as a fashion model, the only guys who pay interest are natural born losers or husbands whose wifes are cheating on them. So thanks a lot. Not every kind of guy. You know very well that you're beautiful. I'm 55 years old, kiddo. I think you're very beautiful. Well, thank you, Brenda. But at the same time, let's be honest. Here, I don't even notice whites. We're too busy sitting beside blacks, no? If blacks turn you on so much, you must've been born in Montreal. - There's new shortage of blacks up there. - Well, that's for sure. At the plant in my workshop the act is stand. And you never dated any of them? No way. At home black guys don't interest me. Here, they are very different. It's true. You're right, I don't know why. Is it because they're closer to nature? Is it the sun? Anyway, they're more gracious. The big differece, sweetheart, is that here you see them stripped to the waist. I don't know if it's just that. I know you don't know it, but I'm sure of it. And I'm also sure it's precisely why you came back here. So stop pretending. You didn't come here just to get a nice tan. I mean think of those cute guys. They're a dime in dozen. Take your pick. - Ellen. - Am I shocking you? Why am I shocking you? Have a little... - Well, it's a bit... - Listen. I will let you in in something. I'm crazy about love. Sex or love. I'm not sure anymore. I was told myself that when I'm old I'd pay a young man to love me. I just didn't think it would happen so fast. Other than that, I have no problem with it. And, Brenda, listen to me. You shouldn't either. What you're shy to pay them are certain gifts. I know you aren't asleep. Hello, do you remember me? Ellen. - It's difficult to forget. - Cheater. You are very beautiful, like a doe. Beautiful doe. Me? Beautiful doe? I look at you and I think you're a doe. And what about you? I suppose you're a tiger? Exactly. Tiger. No, stop, I don't like you like this. I'm sorry. I don't want to disappoint you. What do you want? You think it's about you. It looks good. Do you want me to kiss you? No. It's OK with me. Don't people need tenderness? Yes, but I'm not in a hurry, I don't have the need. A little Sal?. Come on, lay on the stomach. Wait, don't move. What do you do? Don't move. Are you charmed? Or do you hold me up to ridicule? I want to see your sleeping face and your neck. Whatever you like. What do you want to do later? I don't know. Let's go to the beach at 5. It's OK with me. - Later. - OK. - Good morning. - Good morning, Ebgar. !Personal privacy. OK, prepare the food and I'll take care of the tables. Don't interrupt us. I am 55. Let me tell you there's nothing in Boston for a woman after 40. Don't tell me it's otherwise. I was in all those bars of that damn snobbish city. But neither from near nor from far there's nothing resembling to that in here. I do not hope that the affair develops thus A boy born in NY is the same goat as that born here. I'm on a pile of shit. I was always drawn by the South. But I've never thought about Port-au-Prince. I don't believe it really exists. It's like a cattle farm. Yet it's the 6th time I arrive here annually. And I spend the whole summer here. Each time I stay in this hotel. It's calm, neat... The beach is beautiful. And I feel like coming home. I have the opportunity to have a good holiday. I am a professor at Wesley. I teach French literature. I'm trying to delay catching my husband red-handed. Sometimes, in the process of grizzling in the hallway we discover that the guy left us. I cry my story of a fat cat. We descend during the number two and the next day it's forgotten. We come back to be exposed like a small dove of peace. I don't ever see my little companion like this. I guess he resembles everybody. I don't know. When they cry you see they're those martyred teenyboppers. Perhaps they like to see a woman cry. I don't. You never go to the city? I like the market. It's cheap there. I buy sculptures, paintigs... I take it all home. It's cluttered. As for me, the less I move the better it is. I prefer staying in calmness right here. I want to go. Just to see it. Anna and Andrea are invited to the Presidential Palace this evening. It's a party. I'm talking about that minister of something... There'll be about a hundred of people. And after the meal they'll talk about how to feed the city. And besides All the money, all the waste... I don't know for sure. I don't know why you say this. You said it. Do you know the name of this drink? Tequila Sunrise. You know why? Sunrise means the Sun in English. Like the Sun rising on the horizon. I don't care for the name. It's good. I got to go now. Mabye take Brenda to the city. Another time. Bye. - Bye. - Bye. I have no money to pay for the beverage. I can't find it here. I have it. Take it. Bye. Have a nice evening. Is it so bad? A night with girls alone? Did you see? It was for you. You have a fan here! I don't look at the boys, I am watching the game. You are not interested in football now? You would think it's boyswho are interested in football. Be careful. I like the boy over there. You mean me? Not, I mean Edie. Tell me how come they all fall for you? I will explain later. I still have a game to win. Help him, give him a piece of advice. He's pitiful, help him. Your problem is what you speak about a lot. Than what should I do? Take my clothes off? No, wear good clothes. But if I come, they all walk away. Perhaps you are right. Yes. Is it all? Everybody's characteristics is different. You are just a friend, not a lover. This is also quite good. Sir, 10 gourdes. You know who you talk to? You can't talk like that. Show me your licence! Show your papers! You always take 10 gourdes? He did nothing to you! Do you have a problem? Not, all right. Execuse me, madam, we can't serve him. Why not? These are the rules. But I want to eat with him. He is my guest guest, that's all. Invited or not, this is impossible. This is unbelievable! He eats with us on the beach all day. You can eat there with whoever you want. But this is a restaurant. I'm asking for the second time, give him the menu. Anyway, Madam, the kitchen is closed. But I believe it's at least warm. We've got chicken, Madam. Do you want chicken? Yes, I like chicken. And give him a drink, please. It's incredible how racist they can be! There are idiots everywhere. I was born in Cap-Haitien before moving here. My family is nationalist. They all fought Americans during the occupation since 1915. My father died not having seen a white lady. It was his distress. He used to say that if I see a white I have to run away. My grandfather didn't experience that danger. Whites were just animals for him. When he thought about whites, it was equivalent to Americans. What's sad, the invaders desired the land. If he only had known Americans are here, he would have come from dead. Those follies are not to love them. They are a bit more than just a status we gain. Dollar Result? Everybody, who had contact with it, is corrupted. All paid for it. And that's when Brenda discovered she's a bitch in need. Ellen, please. Like us all, darling! Hello, big boy, is it a feast today going to the restaurant? Brenda invited me. Yes, I saw it. Do you want to take a walk if you finished? I'm hungry but we can go. Eventually, she takes all that she wants. It's about time. Everything resembles what Ellen left in Boston. That's what life is. SUE A discreet woman feeling different 'cause of her British accent. But here, like the Sun, it's a part of the picture. So everybody is sunburnt or dead, we must go uphill. But the boys are crazy about her. Only she achieved this. I work in a company that sells food processors. I work in a warehouse, only with men. I'm good with it. We sometimes make each other laugh after the work. But I don't find them too attracitve. I slept with one of co-workers. And then I thought of what I'd done. However now he didn't work with me. He took my interest when I saw him. But it's not like I wanted him all to myself. Imbecil. He thought that mabye I consider getting married or something. But I wasn't. We had good sex. But that's all. It ended like I could've never imagined. I know that I am a lonely person. However, when I arrive here, I feel like a butterfly. I have no obligations here. And Neptun. It's not complicated with him. I think that I love him. I really love him. I know that it functions only here, but here, it is like that. Everything is different. It's better. So... What will you give me? I give you... I give you my heart. I don't care about your heart. What have you got for me? That you want what? What do you want? Let me think. What does make you feel happy? A passport. Why do you think that I this? Miss Savannah already suggested it? - Who is Miss Savannah? - Brenda. - You are here alone. - But did she suggest it? But... I don't want to have a passport. That's your answer. So... I don't like this. - Really? - I don't like how you behave around me. You're too playful. You're too old for that. Thanks. Look at me. You're very beautiful. You have beautiful hair. And now you act like a juvenile flapper. What's the matter? - I have enough. - You're already having no fun? Can't you swim? - I can teach you. - If you want... OK. Relax, lay on the water. Relax. Get on the car! What are you doing here? Where are we going? Execuse me, you don't have to be afraid. However this is only way I could talk to you. What do you want? A little bit trust. You're in a deep shit. Ekbar, please, it's not a nice thing to say. I have nothing to say. So listen. One evening, 2 month ago, I went on a wake. Colonel Beauvais was also there with his the wife and his daughter. He looked so seriously, I didn't think that he noticed me. The day after, Frank appeared looking for me. I don't know how he found me. These persons will get what they want. He didn't give ma any choice. Did he hurt you? No, it's not like that. It's about jewellery, smile, gifts, roses. But when you already know who gives you jewellery, smile, just for trying to please him, he can beat every imbecil who crosses your way. You should understand that all of it is as cold as a machine gun on your neck. But you like it. No, Ekbar. Don't blame me if you're to blame too. It's not a moral lesson for you. Take a look around, look at my younger sister. Mary is nice for everyone. She's still sleeping with him, cleaning after him. What about your cousin Makenson, who repairs tires? He humiliates himself everyday? Tell me... You and me. Are we made for that? No. Do you agree? It doesn't explain why I'm in the car. What are you trying to say? Do you want me to kill colonel? No. Listen... I am alone. I need a friend, a friend who I can talk to. Without controlling what I said. I need someone trustworthy, a true friend. It's the first time I feel so freely. I had many lovers but no friends. Can you hold me in your arms? Frank... Did you see this boy? He is my friend. Take a good look. Do you hear me? I tell you that this is my only friend. Frank is my guardian angel. He can also be yours. Now, when he accepted you, no one can hurt you. It's late, Mademoiselle. 2 minutes, Frank. I have to go, but promise me something. Promise me we'll see each other again. We can meet at my mother's house, or at your mother's. She would be happy. She loves stories about you, when I come see her. She would like us to see each other. She would be very happy. Do you agree? Who is she? She can't be staying at the hotel, I've never seen her. Go and ask him if you're so interested. All I can say she was escorted tonight by a charming little brut of a guy. Brenda, if I were to advice, give him a free rain. Look who's talking! If you are here for a husband, you've come to the wrong adress. Ekbar belongs to everyone. He makes the decisions. So, madams, What do you think about? What's the matter? You look tense. Come, relax. Are they yours? It looks good, doesn't it. You don't like them? You bought it for him. Yes, I did. Did I need your permission? When will we stop discuising him? It's not for him. He looks like a black guy from Harlem. Don't come to Haiti if that's what you're looking for. What did you say? I said that you look like a guy from Harlem now. You don't like guys from Harlem? No, I don't. Would you like to dance? Yes. It's that. Take her dancing, it'll make you feel good, but have courage. For three years you were all I could think of. I missed you. I missed you so much. It's like an addiction. My whole body ached. My head, my belly... It's just agony, every day, every night... Especially every night. Do you feel sad? A little. Can I accompany you? I you want... What's the matter, young gentleman? I will be gentle like this. No, my dear, I prefer to be alone. - Will we go there? - If you want... Madam, can I take a picture of you? Thanks. - What is it? - Herbs. What's the prics? OK. What do you want to eat? You can't be sure. He wasn't born yesterday and he knows his way around the city better than anyone. I'm telling you. The guy shot at him! The cops would have told you if they found anyone. No way! The guy was a cop if I've ever saw one. Don't exaggerate. Did they treat you OK? They don't like a white woman worrying about a black guy. They almost knocked me down, that's what they did. You'll be OK, you'll be fine. Today you spent all day together. Yeah... Today things were fine. I bought him a lot of presents. He was happy. I even think he was in love with me. He looked at me in a way he never did before. Brenda, c'mon, Brenda. Calm down. Or you want some tranquilizers? Want me to get you some? In my purse... There must be some left. Valium? Do you take a lot of it? Are you crazy? Three? In this heat and with what you drank, it's enough to knock down a mule. It won't do anything for me anymore. Come in. Madam, he is there. Is he OK? - I think yes. - Thank you. Can I talk to you? Come. Go out, go out. - What do you want? - She thought you were dead. What did you think? Who is that guy? Answer me now. What happened? Your silence won't make me help you. Think about it tomorrow. Mabye you will forget about it. If you need anything, you ask me for it. We will find a solution for everything. - Listen, you're not my mother. - What? You are not my mother. It's not the right moment to take offence. Don't you understand? I am really frightened. Can't you see that I want to help you? If you need money, you can ask for it. This is not a problem, you should know. However you have to stay with me in the hotel. Don't go anywhere. Now go with me to my room. Ekbar. Ekbar. If you're in danger I can protect you. I am rich and respected here. I can take you abroad, arrange a passport for you. Tomorrow, if you want. You wold be stupid. You can go stay with me. We can always be together. You can do nothing. Only thoroughly enjoy your life. You could walk the streets without fear. Ask yourself. Ekbar, Ekbar. Where are you going? Brenda? I see you've found the path. It's been 15 days. Where have you been? You look tired. I was worried. I don't know where you go. You are very tired. Didn't you sleep? Tell me where you slept. - I slept. - Where? Do you want anything? Food? Do you want a coffee? Yes, thanks. I am very tired. I seeked in the hospital, in the prison... I asked your friends if they know where Mister could be. Mister is bad, he brings havoc to the streets. I'm tired of him. I have little to give you but you can return to living here. You should live together with your mum. Mum, don't say it again! I worry about you! You worry me. I'll give you this. Where did you earn the money? I worked. Thank you. Gotta go, mum. Poor Brenda! She's in pain... Such pain! Ellen, please. What were you thinking of, Brenda? Marrying him? Taking him to Savannah, Georgia? Mrs. Ekbar. Everything was fine 'till you got here. We led a simple life. Then you arrived. Dragging along your romantic love, Your goddamn syropy love. You convinced yourself Ekbar was a love of your life. You wanted him all to yourself. Let me tell you something. You're not better than the rest of us. We're all here for a good time, that's all. But we don't kid ourselves, we don't cheat. You don't think you can just show up and upset everyone just because some kid gave you an orgasm. He's dead now. Your stupidity kill him. Romance is over. Welcome to Haiti! Didn't you realize no one is allowed to grow too tall in this country? That's enough, Ellen. Who are you to talk like that? Everyone here knows you're suffering too. Everyone knows you were madly in love with Ekbar. Mabye. But I respected him. Don't you want to wait a few days before leaving? You shouldn't take off in a hurry. I'm sure Ellen is already sorry for what she said. Like you, she's still in a state of shock. Can you hear me, Brenda? Of course I can hear you. Are you all right? I'm fine. I know it's tough for you, but you should go talk to her. It doesn't matter anymore. What was that? I said it didn't matter anymore. In what way? I don't give a damn what Ellen thinks. That's a step forward. The most important thing is that you should go home at peace with your heart. At peace with my heart... What is it? Nothing. Stop looking at me that way. What have I done to you? The way you look at me is more than enough. I'm sick of those looks that say "poor Brenda, crazy as ever". I never think anything like that. Your look thinks for you, sweetheart. I hate the way people look at me, I've always hated that. I mean my husband looked at me, the way my family or my friends did. Maybe Ellen's right. Mabye I didn't love Ekbar. All I know is I loved the way he looked at me. I certainly loved that. When did he leave the hotel? I don't know. At 10? Write down 10:30. OK, I won't bother you anymore. - Is it all? - Excuse me? Don't you want to know why we quarreled? I don't feel that your quarrel would bring anything up. What do you know about that? Execuse me madam, but Ekbar wasn't a saint. A boy like him had million reasons to end up like that. I think you didn't know him. You know nothing about Ekbar. I'm sorry, madam. I can't understand. It's all so simple for you. But there was a murder. There, on that beach, two persons died. Don't you feel that this is a very dangerous affair? Tell her from me that it wasn't a tourist who died. Goodbye, madam. What did he say, Albert? What did he say? He said that... He is said that tourists don't die. Did you know her? Who? That young woman on the beach, did you know her? No, I've never seen her. It interests me who started a quarrel which ended like that. Since I have nothing to say I will go back to my life. He wanted to stay overnight with Brenda. And that young girl... Mabye he truly loved her. Do you think so? Perhaps someone killed them when they were making love. Stop, you torture yourself. What do I do here? I already don't know. I want to go home, to my husband. Mabye he's waiting there. He was so beautiful. I wanted to look at him for hours. I could almost touch him. Two times, I... wanted to die but he didn't stay in my body. If not for this I would have done everything without a fear. I wanted to be ready for him. Sometimes I imagined myself with my friend, a trifle of me, like all the others. But now it's all the same, I've never suffered so much. Goodbye, Albert. Goodbye, madam. Have the courage. Of course I won't go back home. Besides, I don't have a house anymore. Or husband. I want nothing to do with men from the north. I want to visit other island on the Caribbean. Cuba, Guadelupe, Barbados, Martinique, Trinidad, Bahamas. They have such lovely names. I want to know them all.
