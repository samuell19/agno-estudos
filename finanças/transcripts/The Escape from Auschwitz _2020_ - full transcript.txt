For every action, there is a reaction. Escape does not set you free. Work sets you free. If you fail to recognize this rule, I will continue to remind you. Show you, in fact. As a consequence of your actions, this, of course, is part of my day. My recreation. My ability to serve my country with authority. The fatherland demands respect. And respect it shall have. Rosa. Rosa. I can't keep doing this if you're not able to cooperate. Cooperation is not something I'm willing to risk my life for. Please. Everything okay? Pick it up. Pick it up. You choose to disobey me? Look at me. Run. Stop. Back to work. Freedom. You think this is playtime? You're here to obey us. So you will obey us. Load the wagon. If they see you resting, I'll be cleaning your blood. Sorry I'm late. What happened? Another attempt. You know how? No real plan by the sounds of it. A man that skipped his duties of pulling a cart full of rubbish. Caught? - On the south border. - Suicide. How many? 50. Death by starvation. Stop. These walls see everything. I shouldn't have to warn you. This is a nightmare. I'm going to escape. And your punishment will be the murder of hundreds of Jews. If things continue as they are, it'll be thousands before liberation. What are you suggesting? The world needs to know. And you're assuming they do not know already? Extremism is humanity's best kept secret. You can look at me. You are doing a good job here. Roll call is in 10 minutes. 15223. Clean yourself up. 46574. Is there a problem? I won't ask again! We must remember that neither escape or suicide are acts of bravery. Instead, they both demonstrate pure cowardice. You may all be wondering why I chose not to shoot him in the head. Because he wanted to die. So that he could not be punished. Sadly... This is not how it works. But let's not dwell. We are running behind, and my breakfast will spoil. Everybody back to the barracks! Immediately! I saw you. I don't know what you're referring to. The Kapo. Everyone, inside immediately! I want to know the contents of the paper he gave you. And why didn't you just take it from him? Well? I'm not willing to risk my life, and most importantly, everybody else's. Halt! What was he asking for? He's part of a small resistance group in the male sector of the camp. They claim they need someone from this side to assist them. And you don't want to help? I just want to survive. What is the matter with you? I've been taking notes. What kind of notes? Documenting the entries against the murders in the camps. Nationalities, age, gender, date of death. And what's the problem? I think I must've fallen asleep before I hid them last night, and somebody's taken them. Is there a problem? Back to work. Why did you take my paperwork? I think you're lucky I found it rather than somebody else. Why did you keep it a secret? They're just statistics. If I'd have known your intentions of escaping were for more than your own personal gain, I may have been less reluctant in the first place. Thoughts? It's nothing I don't already know. It's what needs to be told. Oh and how are you suggesting we spread the word? I was hoping that's where you might step in. All this will be for nothing, if you do not plan accordingly. Think about how many we could save. And if we get caught, think of how many will be sacrificed for our stupidity. Well, our sacrifice could end this for good. Well, I'm unsure how you think we can save the world. I do have something to offer. I speak German. Stop. No resting until you've reached Kanada. That's where the treasure is. Food. Better. What could be better than food? Clean this. Move. Where did you say he was taking that cart? Once the carts are filled with the possessions of the Jews they're coming on the train. They collect them and take them for sorting. How far is Kanada from here? Do you know what the living conditions are like? Fewer guards. And alcohol. Don't forget I'm just a regular Auschwitz man working. Working on what? Mechanics. Right again. Rosa. I know. What do you mean? I know. What do you want? To help. I am privileged here. I have more authority than most. You want to help us? I have a good reputation with the guards. I have more access than most in Kanada. Rosa doesn't want to help, but I do. You need to get back. Now. Kanada. So... Kanada. You understand Kanada is not a retreat? Less guards, less chance of getting caught. And how do you suppose you would get there without being caught? Tonight, I escape from the barracks, and hide in the carts bound for Kanada in the morning. I'll disguise myself amongst the contents of the cart, and pretend that I'm assigned to Kanada. From there, I will make my escape. You have not thought this through. You do not have to come with me. But I may have more chance of surviving if you do. I will arrive at the second cart from the right of the male barracks after nightfall. I will not be suspected until the morning. Heinrich! How many tomorrow? 23,000 from Hungary. And you are prepared? I am. Are you? The team around us is questionable. How so? Missing inmates. Hey. Shh, shh, shh, shh. Now we rest. You're going to sleep? And you're not? Tomorrow's a big day. Tomorrow. We're early. Maybe there's an early arrival into the camp. They might see the cart sooner. The arrival pattern's been the same for months. Okay, we stick to the same plan. A couple of hours won't make a difference to the escape. We'll still be out of the perimeter before morning roll call. Maybe. But we just turned left. This cart isn't going to Kanada. We need to move. Quickly. What is your destination? Maintenance. On this cart by the garage. I'm normally based in Kanada. The guards, they recommended I was best for the job. Move swiftly. We don't have much time. I'm glad I decided to intervene. When we met the other day, you asked too many questions, but I'm glad you did. I was surprised that for a seasoned prisoner you didn't know more about Kanada. Still, I made it sound too appealing. I have thought about hiding in a cart and disguising my way out to that part of the camp. But the truth is, nobody's escaped from Kanada, much as nobody's escaped from the rest of the camp. - It was suicide mission. - You don't know that. And you do? I'm going to help you to escape. I'm going to help us to escape. I guess that you've been thinking of Kanada as your easiest way out of here. So I suggested that one of the carts that would be sent for sorting stop by here first, for maintenance. It was risky, but even the SS can be fooled. And they didn't think to supervise you? They know I'm capable. But they don't know how capable I really am. And they like to drink on a Friday night. Saturday mornings are hard, even for the SS. So why are we sitting here talking about it then? That over there is a coal bunker. There's a hatch on the inside that grants access to a storeroom where the SS keep some of their uniforms and weapons. If we can break into that coal bunker, before daily proceedings begin, we can act as the SS, using this car as our ticket out of here. Well, what're we waiting for? Why not now? Because morning roll call occurs camp-wide in 20 minutes. And they will realize we are missing. That siren you've been hearing. That's the alarm for the camp and surrounding towns warning them of fugitives who must be caught. Because if the world knew what was happening here, it would end everything. At least, we can hope. So what do we do now? The sirens that have been ringing for the last three days are because of two Hungarian escapees who failed in leaving the camp unnoticed, caught before they left the final perimeter. Now, the two who brought you here. Adam is assigned to forming the straw stacks, 500 yards away from here. That's where you'll be hiding. Hiding? Gavriel is a Kapo based at the Kanada sector of the camp. They won't be escaping with us. But they have my promise that I will not die before telling the world of the atrocities happening in Auschwitz. In three mornings time, they'll meet you with two Kapo armbands. You will pretend to march them to the coal bunker, acting as their superiors. Once you've broken into the coal bunker, the hatch will grant you access to the storeroom where we'll have everything that we need. Apart from the car, of course, but that's for me to worry about. The rest will go like clockwork. Once the alarm sounds for your disappearance, you cannot be seen by anyone. After three days of sirens, the search is called off. And that's when we make our move. I need to know that you're ready for this. I am ready. Gavriel and Adam have orders to take the cart back to its final destination at Kanada as soon as I'm done with it. If you're seen entering or leaving that cart, you'll be killed on the spot, along with other Jews and punished for your disobedience. As soon as they've noticed the cart has left the local vicinity, they will come to check up. But with the cart already on its way back to Kanada, they'll take my word. Plus, one more guard checking up on me is one less guard for you to worry about. When the cart stops, you'll have less than 50 yards to travel undetected. Gavriel will escort you to the straw stack, when the coast is clear. Adam will stay with the cart, ensuring no guards become suspicious. If you are approached, your last hope will be to explain that your duties have been changed because of increased executions at the camp. But once you reach your hiding place, you should be safe. You'll have one can of gasoline between you. That should cover up your scent. The dogs will be on a hunt and they won't stop until they find you. Adam will continue to replenish the straw stacks every day as part of his camp duties. He'll be able to leave you one piece of wet bread per day for you to share. This should be sufficient to keep you hydrated and fed enough for survival. In three mornings time, when you act as Kapo to Gavriel and Adam, you will be at your highest danger. But be bold. Be brave. Just don't get caught. You understand... This is the second escape this week. The prisoners will start to become... Reluctant. We're still superior. Not in the eyes of a populated army. No matter how inferior their race may be. The siren went off not more than one hour ago. One hour too many. Someone coming. There's a note. Outside entrance. It's wet. They said it would be. You fell asleep. Bad dream? Apart from the nightmare, you slept well. I've slept better. They're already bringing the straw. That's strange. That means we get fed sooner, no? Yeah, we can hope. Security has risen. They're bringing more guards from Auschwitz one. And more dogs from the other side too. They're prioritizing finding those escapees, and they'll stop at nothing until they do. Are you sure these aren't just rumors? You should have more faith in the SS. It's not the SS that concerns me. What does it say? "Things are bad out here. Security has heightened. And the search for you both is beyond what I expected. But fear not. We will meet before dawn. Hours earlier than originally planned. Continue to be alert." You smell blood, don't you? Over here! What do we do now? We wait. What're you doing? We are recapping. So... Tomorrow morning at dawn, Adam and Gavriel will meet us here at the straw stacks. We put on the Kapo bands to disguise our identity and to give us both more authority. Right but we just have to walk 500 yards undetected. And once Jonas has arrived at the bunker, we'll wait for him to change and collect weapons. We will then leave Gavriel and Adam to clear any evidence, while Jonas, you and I get into the car. There are two main barriers that we need to pass to exit Birkenau. Now, it's not a long drive, but we cannot predict any of the obstacles that may get into our way. However, once we pass this second barrier, we drive. Jonas is driving. And you're in the front with him. Why me? Because you are the only one who speaks German. So if we're stopped, you do the talking. How long are we driving for? 60 kilometers, at least. And once we've stopped? We tell the world. You were a spy before this? No, a builder, and a successful builder never builds a house without strong enough foundation. And you? A German translator, working in education. An intellectual. I'm surprised they didn't try and kill you sooner. They did. We must rest. Wake up. They're here. How much further? Jonas is ready? Hey, keep it down. - Why? - It's too loud. - Ammunition? - Different store. Come on. Come on, come on! A uniform and weapon. It's all you need. Be quick. Everybody keep still. It's too early for morning roll call. - It could be unrelated. - And if it isn't? You both need to leave immediately. You're, you're coming with us? We knew that this might happen. We're just hoping everything is going to plan on the other side of the camp. What, what's this? Your ticket out of here. Now, go. What has happened? We need to move! I am trying. We knew this was going to happen. But the focus is not on us now. We just need to make it out of here alive. The rest, is out of our hands. And if we're caught? Let's not get ahead of ourselves. There's two main SS checkpoints for us to pass through. The first one should be fine, the second, not so easy. What's he doing? Heil Hitler. Halt! Where are you traveling? We have been sent to search for the escapees from Kanada. What's taking so long? Open the fucking gate! Heil Hitler. Another escape. What do you suggest we do? Alert the local villages. The sirens will reach them. I want all the local villages warned about these fugitives, within a 200 kilometer radius. You think they'll make it that far? I don't think we should take the risk. We haven't eaten in three days. We cannot go on like this for much longer. I know. We're lost. Do you think the others managed to make it out? Maybe. Do you dream, Levi? Sometimes. Do you? Every night. Good or bad? I used to ask myself the same thing. Until I realized that even when you're lost in a forest, no dream can be worse than that nightmare. Elazar. Elazar. Do you hear that? Little girl? Yes? - You dropped this. - Thank you. You're welcome. Freedom.
