Hey. Just a second. I'm stepping outside. Yeah. Tell me. What is it, Chechi? Hasn't he come yet? He has gone to buy milk. There he is. Yeah. There he is. Hello. Hello! Tell me once you finish talking to everyone over there. I'll talk after that. You're so silly! Everything is so offensive for you? Get lost! I'm standing on top of this, just to talk to you. Sorry. Keep your sorry with yourself. You didn't tell me when you will start tomorrow, Sachi. What's our plan tomorrow? What tomorrow? Nothing. I'm hanging up then. Hey! Shall I tell you about tomorrow? - Hey! Just hold on. Dude, do you have 100 bucks to spare? Stop irritating me and get lost, you schmuck! Sorry! No problem. Dude, he doesn't have it. - Hello! What did you tell him now? What? - What did you call him now? Schmuck! I don't like you using such language. Is schmuck even a cuss-word, Vasu? Shall I tell you about tomorrow night? Not the night... Morning! What's in the morning? I'll bring you from Kottayam. Before that, my dear should go and tell your mom... that her son is in love with a girl. Hey! My mom is really innocent. Well, all moms are innocent, right? I swear. If you don't believe it, I'll make you listen to it, tomorrow morning. You're bluffing! No, dear. I swear! Hey! I was thinking about tomorrow night. What? Me... and you... A night for us... Some rain, along with that... A lovely Hindi song... That will be just 'Awesome-of-the-India!' No! 'International!' Papa is calling. Is it? Then hang up. I don't feel like hanging up. Then don't hang up. Get lost! Hang up, dear. I also have to get back home anyway. Okay then. I'll call you tomorrow morning. Good night. Okay then. 'Ishq' [Love] Not a Love Story Get into your phone as soon as you wake up in the morning! Tea! Kunjechi! (Sister) It's black tea. I'll give you tea along with Dosa. Where is Kunjechi, mom? - She has gone for a bath. Hey! Your uncle will deposit some cash into your account. Hey! Shall we go buy the clothes today? Hey! No! We can't go today. What was it? I'll be late today, mom. Why? There's one more week for the engagement, right? Time will fly! If we keep postponing, she'll have to exchange rings wearing a Churidar. Keep grinning! If you're late to come home tonight... the next scene will be your wedding! - Scene? Mother! - Don't expect any mercy from mother! Indira aunty's daughter is coming on Friday. If she likes you, you will be done for! You play on the phone a bit too much! Wait! Wait! Why is Indira aunty's daughter coming? They are coming to attend the engagement. Then... They can see you also along with that... We can fix things, right? Why should they see me? Am I a girl or what? I'm a young guy, right? No one has to come to see me. Why? Isn't she a good girl? Mom! - Yes. Did Kunjechi tell you anything? No. Why? Well, I heard that she told you something. What? Anything at all? Anything at all? Don't play the fool. Don't you hear me talking all night on the phone? Don't just... What are you saying? When did I play the fool? What did she tell me? Kunjechi hasn't told you anything? She told me about buying fish or something. Don't crack lame jokes when I'm serious. Okay. Did she say that I'm in love with someone, or that I'm interested in marrying her, or anything like that? No. Nothing at all? Then, I love someone. Where? Don't drive me crazy! Really? You? Don't tease me, mom. - What's happening here? Your Highness was here? You don't know anything, right? I'll throw a bomb during your wedding! Has he gone crazy? Hey! Don't go! Hey Sachi! Tell me and go! Hey! Don't go! What was I going to say? It's okay. I'll take a bath and come! I won't forget. I'll send it right away. Hey Sachi! Mom! Tell him to drop me to the bus stop. We have to go buy a lot of things today. We're really busy. Hey! Send uncle's phone number to this number. Dear... Can't you take an auto rickshaw? Radhamma, you have to tolerate me only for a few more days, right? See you later, mom. Hey Sally! Where are you going? You know Jamshad, right? His sister was groped by some guy. We will rip him apart today, for sure. Is that why you have dressed up so much? Well, it's a college, right? There would be chicks there, right? So you're going to fight there? - Yes. You both go on the bike. We'll come on an auto rickshaw through the back. Shall I hop on? - Hey! Give two punches the guy who groped the sister, from my side. Okay bro! - Done! That's awesome. - Everything should happen as per our plan. - Okay? - Just call that blackie Justin for a confidence. - Okay? Not here. Drop me at Kadavanthra Double Roti restaurant. That's not what you told me when we started. Who's over there? - There... Your brother-in-law. Brother-in-law? You idiot! Your brother-in-law! So what did you tell mom? I should invite people for my engagement, and not you, right? Not mom, as well. Understood? Come on, go fast. Hey! - Hey! Your mom is really funny, huh? I was laughing so much! I'm riding the bike. I'll call you back. This is what mom keeps saying. You're always on the phone! Big deal! Look straight and ride! Here, right? - Yes. Okay. Shall I leave? Aren't you coming in? - No! I have other work. Aren't you on leave for one week? Shouldn't I invite my friends for the engagement? Chechi (sister), one soda, please. Why did the police come? The boys from your quarters started a fight at the college. That's why the police have come. Dude, the mad-men (cops) took Sally, who's from your area. I knew it when those teams entered the college with tools, that it will end up like this. Sally escaped first. The mad-men took him from the quarters. Now they will leave him only after 'taking care' of him. It's funny, bro. Hey man! Shall we go? Dude, will you take the bike? No need, bro. You just drop me home. - Drop you home? Dude, please take care of my bike. Definitely! What's the plan then? It's her birthday today, dude. Is it? - Yes. You'll go broke filling petrol mostly. This one doesn't have any mileage. Shall I return the car after the engagement? That's okay. Bring it after all your work is done. Okay! Tell Kunjechi that I will come in the evening. Dude... So, as we agreed upon! Okay? So, call me after your programme. - Okay. Okay? Bye, dude. Hey! Where are you going? - Wedding. Wedding? - No. To invite for the engagement... Will you invite my friends instead of me? I didn't ask you to get this car, for you to roam around. Nice Saree. Where did you buy it from? Stop giving me scary looks. Go on! Only one week is left. If you cut my call when I call you... I won't let you inside the house. Mind it! I'll be late to come back today. If I get too late, I can come tomorrow, right? Don't annoy me, Sachi. I'm coming. - Okay, bye. Hello! What? Where are you? Okay. So, shall we go? Let's go! I'm really tensed. Did you call the hostel? - No. Call and tell them that you're going home. - I will. Where are we going? You call the hostel first. Okay. Aunty, this is Vasudha. I called to say that I'm going home today. Okay aunty. So, where should we go first? 'Bombay Toast' from Indian Coffee House. Bombay Toast! What happened? Wherever I used to go to with Papa, we'd visit only Indian Coffee House. Is this what you eat usually? Bombay Toast? - Yes. Is your mom always funny like this? My mom has a great sense of humour. I'll coax her easily. Remind me to call mom at 9.30 in the night. Okay. I'll remind you. What happened? Nothing. Is he staring? No. Who? - Shall I order Masala Dosa? - I got late yesterday. Sachi! [Indistinct chatter] Brother... Do you know her? No. Do you know who I am? If you stare at her too much, you'll know who I am, okay? What? What's the problem? Nothing, dude. - Nothing. It's okay. That's a different problem. It's a different problem. What is all this, Sachi? Cheap show! I don't like it. Then why don't you marry me? As if a yellow thread of 5 Rupees is going to decide our freedom? My family has started bringing proposals for me. Yeah right. I believed it! I'm not the only daughter to my father. Someone is coming to see me day after. I swear! And you're telling me now? Vasudha! You're telling me this only now? Answer me, Vasu. Idiot! Get lost!

Don't spoil it. First night, it seems! If there was rain as well, it would have been super awesome, right? It can rain any time, right? Where are we going? This road goes straight, right? Let's go straight, till 2 AM. After that, wherever we reach by then, we'll go back from there, and drop you to the hostel by 6 AM. Not 6 AM. 8 AM is fine. Or else, aunty would ask why I came early. What? Don't you have anything to say? [RJ continues reading messages on Radio] Can you give me a kiss? What? Can you kiss me? Yeah right! Kiss... on the middle of the road? Sachi! - Yes. Where are we going? You have a problem with the middle of the road, right? My dad was admitted here for 5-6 months. Mom and I were here, full time. That was when I left Bangalore. This place has changed a lot now. Many new buildings have come up. There was a parking lot here. I'll go buy some water and come. What about this then? Well, I'll buy one more. You're going to smoke, right? Well, do you want AC? No. Be careful. If it's withered coconut, it will break. You and your damn withered coconut! When I bring it at midnight, the old man is complaining! What? You look really pretty. Go! Shall we go? - Where? Back... Give me a kiss and we'll go. Is that enough? Tell me. - No. What is this? Nothing. Vasu... Come here. Shall I come there then? Why are you throwing so much attitude, Vasu? It's paining! Let's go. - Go where? Let's go back. We're not going until you kiss me. I didn't ask for something that will get over if you give it, right? It's just a kiss, Vasu. Just one. Turn that side. Close your eyes. Shouldn't I see? Okay, okay! Sorry! Sorry! Sachi... Let's sit here for some more time? Let's go! Let's go then. Hey! Don't go like that. Sachi... What is it, Chetta (brother)? - Move. What is it? - Move. What's the problem? Move away. - Where? Move, Chetta. Don't play around. Move. Tell me the matter, Chetta. Don't... Don't shoot a video, please. Please, Chetta. Tell me, what's the problem? What are you doing here? - What? What is it? - What were you both doing? Nothing. We weren't doing anything. I saw it. - What? Move, Chetta. Let us go. - Don't act so tough. If you act tough, you'll be the one in trouble. What trouble? What were you doing? - Nothing, Chetta. We came to the hospital. - Hospital? We came to the hospital. Is it you who's sick or her? - What the... Did you get it cured? Who are you? Move, Chetta. Are us policemen here to **** up then? Sir... What sir? Ask her to come outside. No, sir... Ask her to come outside. - What is it? Or no need. Let me call the station. Sir... Then she'll come out on her own. Sir. Don't call them, sir. Sir, let's talk. Sir, don't call. Move away. Move away, I say! Yes, sir. Yes. I'm at the hospital. Yes. Two people. Yes. They were doing that only. Do you think I'll let them go, sir? Yes. I'll be here. Will you send a vehicle, sir? Okay sir. Chetta, what is it? What is it? - What's in the car? - Nothing. Hello sir. What's the problem? These kids came to the hospital. They were upto something in the car. There's so much space in the hospital, and what were you upto in the car? Nothing, Chetta. The other one is inside. I saw! That's interesting. Why did you come to the hospital? My friend's uncle is in the hospital. - Whose? My friend's uncle. Where? - He's in the ward. And did you see him? Yes. - Why are you shivering for that? I didn't shiver! Come here. Let me tell you something. Come! Come, son. If someone is in the hospital upstairs, shouldn't we bring him down? Only then we'll know who it is, right? Call him! Aren't you calling him? Whom are you lying to? You think us policemen are fools? No, sir. This won't work out, sir. Let the vehicle from the station come. Let's get there and decide whether he has to say the truth or not. Sir, don't make it an issue... My sister's wedding is about to happen real soon. Don't create an issue. - Why shouldn't we? You think you could do all this debauchery here, and escape easily? Us policemen are assigned on duty here to catch all this! And you are canoodling here in your car? Well, I have seen you somewhere. I've seen him somewhere. No, sir... I've never come here. - No? What's your name? - Sachi. Sachi? - Sachidanandan. Where's your house? At Ernakulam. - Where in Ernakulam? Panampilly Nagar. Where in Panampilly Nagar? - Near Diamond Park. Diamond Park? The girl's house? - Kottayam. Where in Kottayam? Ramapuram. See! The girl from Ramapuram, Kottayam and you from Kochi.. What were you doing in this car? Nothing, sir. Let me see that girl then. Sir, we're going to get married. She's my would-be. - You marry her! Move! Sir, I'll tell you the truth now. We were going to Trivandrum. We stopped the car when I felt sleepy. - Good you didn't sleep. Sir, that's the truth. Please believe me. How do we believe you? What did you say first? You came to the hospital because you were sick! Then what did you say? Your friend's uncle was sick! Now you're saying that you're going to Trivandrum. Sir, everything he's saying is a lie. - Yes. No, sir. This is not a lie. Why should you park your car here, if you're going to Trivandrum? They won't get this pleasure on the highway, right? And no one would know if it's in a hospital's car park, right? Move. Bring her out. Sir, don't bring her out. People will notice. Please sir. Why are you grinning? Why is he grinning? Did I crack a joke? You're getting a call. It's from the station. It's from the station! Come here. Let me tell you something. Did they bring the stuff yet? They are calling. Arrange it fast. - You wait here. Let me talk. - It's trouble. The call is from Night Patrol. Sir, please tell that sir. Son, that sir is quite dangerous. Go and tell him instead of telling me. Yes. We are here. What about the thing I asked you for? When will you reach? You're taking so long! Vasu... We'll go, right? Let's go.. - I... I will talk to them. You sit here, okay? Okay? Nothing to worry, okay? Nothing to worry. Sachi... Buy it with whatever you have. I'll give it when you reach here. Sir... Sir... She's the girl I'm going to marry. Sir, I swear, we didn't do anything. We were just talking. Looking at you both, anyone can guess that you are from good families. After doing all this nonsense in this car... Moreover, if this becomes a case, it will be a huge hassle. Sir, I don't know what I have to say to make you believe me. Sir, forgive me just this once. Sir, at least for her sake. I'll only be as old as your son, right? I'll fall at your feet. Don't do all that. Sir... You can go for the time being. Thank you sir. What about that sir? I'll tell him. You can go. Thank you, sir. He asked us to go. How much would that be? Sachi! - Stop! Open! Open, I say! - That sir told us. - Which sir told you? Give me the key! - Sir, please. Sir, please tell him. Leave the key. - This sir let us go. - What did I tell you? Leave it. - Sir, the key will bend. You're messing with a policeman? Come here. Let those kids go! What kids? Did you... I mean, sir see what these kids did? Move. When I looked, she was sitting on his lap. What? Sir, what all are you saying? Son, did you lie to me? I swear, nothing like that happened. What are you saying, sir? You thought you could fool him and go? You're such a fraud! Sir... Nothing like that, sir. If there was nothing like that? Then what was it like? What? If there was nothing like that, what was it like? Say it, son. What did you to her in the car? Tell me. Tell me the truth. What did you do? Sir, it was nothing. Let us go, sir. What is this? You can go if you say the truth. Don't you want to go? You can go. Tell me the truth and go. But don't think you can fool the police and go. Did you hug her? Did you hug her? Did you do it? If you did, then say the truth to sir. Admit it if you have hugged her. Then you can go. After hugging her? Did you kiss her? Say it if something happened, boy! What did you do after hugging her? Say it. What did you do? Did you kiss her? Yes. Where did you kiss her? Where did you kiss her? Say it, son. Sir... Let us go, sir. You don't have to go! How can you kiss, being like this? Sir, come with me. Say whatever the truth is to sir, and get going! Sir. - Coming! What are you doing, man? When I build up something nicely... What did you build up? Did those guys get the stuff? What stuff? - Where's the bottle? You're worried about the bottle, when we have rich kids in our hands? Who's that? Then ask them for money! That's 'Snake'. 'Snake'! It's me, Alwin. Nothing. You carry on. I'll call you. Go! Sir, people have started noticing. Let us go, sir. Say that to him. No point telling me. Sir, people have started noticing. - Let them notice. For what you did, you both should be stripped and paraded on the road! Look at him standing like a post! I should have given you one... punch first itself! Now let the vehicle from the station come. Did you call to the station after that, sir? Didn't you call the station? That can wait. They are kids. If their family and people know this... No! What do you actually do? I work for a company in Kakkanad Infopark. Came for some company, from a company? If you're taken to the police station, it will be a huge case. Sir, that's what I said. Don't make it an issue. I'll do whatever you want. That won't work. If we don't make this a case, we will be in trouble later. Sir, they are kids, right? Shouldn't we consider their future? They are young kids... - What kids? They are big shots, sir. What I'm saying is that... we needn't go to the station! Call the people here, call their families, and get the married here itself. Instead, if they go to the station, they can get out easily. Sir.. - Didn't you see her? She's a big shot. Sir, please forgive us for this one time. Didn't I say that I'll do the needful? Come here. How much do you have? Around 5000 Rupees. What say, sir? 5000 bucks? You're mocking us? You're scr**ing me over after scr**ing her? I'll take the rest from an ATM. - Where? From an ATM. - He'll get it from somewhere. We should consider their future. Start the car. Come on, fast. Come on! Get inside. Sir, don't go to the backside. What's wrong if I get in here? Don't sit with her. Move! Start the car first. This sir won't do anything to your girl. Start the car, son. Come on! Try to escape somehow, you loser! Get in. Mosquitoes have entered the car. Sir... Can you sit at the back? Why? Come, sir. Sit here. We'll make her sit in the middle then. Come on, start the car. I'm not going to touch your left-over. Start the car, kiddo. Come on, let's go. Sir... Did you see this? - What? Look at him bringing a wall. He's really suspicious. Does he suspect you too? Stop doing circus with one hand, and drive with both hands! Drive properly, son. What's your name, dear? Didn't you hear me? Why are you getting scared? Is a banana stuffed in your mouth? Tell me your name. Look straight and drive, man! Tell me your name. Vasudha. You were reluctant to say such a nice name? Look straight! Son, you look straight and drive. He's scared whether this girl would sit on your lap when he's not looking. What is it? - What is it, son? ATM. He's really lucky. We've reached an ATM. Go and withdraw how much ever you can. How much should I withdraw? Get 5000 Rupees. Go. What is it? Aren't you going? Look at him going! Turning back every second. What a schmuck! He'll believe whatever we say! There's one movie in which the husband suspects the wife, right? Which one? - 'Can I get a pestle?' Oh! That one! I'll tell you. Sreenivasan's movie. - 'Vadakkunokkiyanthram'. I've seen it 3-4 times. Isn't there another dialogue in it? 'I don't need so much wind' Our boy is coming. Sir... - What happened? There's no cash in this ATM. There's an ATM after the bridge. Let's go there. It's okay. You get inside. Let's see if we can let you go without paying money. Get in. - Get in and start the car. Stop dancing around and get in. None of you are sleepy or what? Sleep... Start it. Let's go. Turn the car around! Play some music, kid. We're going our own ways, right? Let's leave happily. Do you have a cassette? How do I switch this on? - Don't play music. He will sing. Won't you sing? I don't know any song, sir. Oh no! If you don't know... - Mukundan sir, sing that song! Which one? - The one you sing while drinking with Kunjumon. How can I sing that without having 2 drinks? Imagine that you've had a couple of drinks! Okay listen! 'Even if you wear a decayed flower' 'Don't wear a used flower' 'Smiling girls can deceive you, never forget that' 'A handsome boy from Kochi' 'And a naughty girl from Kottayam' 'Got into the car and...' 'Even if you wear a decayed flower' 'Don't wear a used flower' 'Smiling girls can deceive you, never forget that' 'Smiling girls can deceive you, never forget that' Pull the car over to that side. A little more. A little more forward. Why did we stop here? What happened? Have you boozed, sir? How can I booze? I asked you if they brought it, right? But I can smell booze. Have you boozed? But I don't think she would... You turn that side, man! Have you boozed? Are you on alcohol? Sir... Calm down. Let me ask her. Come on, blow out. Blow! Has she boozed? I think so! You come out. Just go out. Go ahead. Come out. You want to pee? Then move forward. She needn't see it. Hey! Come here. Stop repeating what you said, and tell me the truth. Where did you score her from? I know that boys like you can score girls like her from Kochi. What's the rate? 5000 & Churidar? You're getting a call. Pick up. Must be your saviours! Let this be with me. I can't let it go on like this. Shall we go, man? What's in this? What's in this? No condom in this? Usually, do you bring it, or your custom... - Move away, you dog! Vasu, there's a limit in tolerating! - How dare you touch a policeman! They said they're policemen, right? Let's go to the police station. Let's go from here. - Listen to me, Vasu. No. - You...!! No! Alwin, no! We have to live together anyway. Let's face this. Listen to me. - If Papa knows this, I'll commit suicide. Sachi, don't. How dare you hit a policeman, you son of a @%@^@! You think you can mess with a policeman? People will notice, man! Stop it. People are coming. Now there's only two of us to sc**w your girl. You want to see more people joining? They are my boys! Sir, what's happening? What about the blood donors? He said he will arrange it, right? Didn't you call them after that? Didn't you call them? - Didn't you? They have crossed Kottayam. - Kottayam? Where did you boys go? - To watch a movie (in Hindi). Which movie? - Uri. When are they going to reach? We've been waiting for so long! Those are the north Indians from the tile factory. If they had also joined, it would have been awesome. They are outsiders. They will be really strong! What acting is this, man? Loser! You've come out with this loser who can't act? You're all sweaty! Switch on the AC. Come. Let me say something. Come. - I'll sort you out soon. You heard me? - Come. Alwin, what game are you playing? You're over-doing everything! Get something from them, and send those kids away quickly. Come with me. - Where? Shall we go? Shall we go? They will catch us, Sachi. Sachi...!! Let me ask you. What's your plan? Who's there? Who is it? You've been there for a long time now! Didn't you hear me? It's that annoying doctor. Hold this. It's me, sir. - Who? We came to the hospital. Sir... - For some blood... So what are you doing in front of my house? Nothing. We just moved a little forward. Should I call the police? - Not necessary. Then get going! - We just came forward a bit. Stop staring and start the car. Let's scoot. To spoil my sleep at midnight. - Get in. If the police comes, you'll be in trouble! Get in, I say! Get in, you loser! There was no space to park there. That's why... - Get going. Come on, start. - Quick! Let's go! Doesn't he have to sleep or what? Pull over to that side. To the left. Yeah. Stop there. Why are we stopping here? - I'll tell you. Who's that? - That's an auto rickshaw. Have the boys brought the bottle? Alwin, this is that creep. Don't get involved. You've been eating for quite a long time now. Give some to us also, man! Yeah. I've shat some here. Shall I get that for you? So you're the one who shits? - Yes. Then I need to see that shit. That creep is coming here. - Mukundan, you're also here? Move! Don't create an issue. - Alwin, don't create an issue. Sir, please. If he doesn't know it, advise him. Come on! Try advising me! - Get lost! Alwin, don't create an issue. - What issue? No, Chetta. There's no problem here. Please go. I'll put an end to his frustration now. - What will you do on this road? He is drunk! Muruganna... Muruganna, please go. Get going. Police is doing rounds. Don't get into trouble. I agree all that. But tell him something. I have seen a lot of 'food', and eaten it too. Understood! If you have eaten it, go and shit. - I'll make you shit. [Mumbling] I'll sort you out! I'll sort you out. - Come on! Try! What did you drink today? When I find something to eat from somewhere, he comes to eat the left-overs. Bloody... - You're his guy, right? - I'm going. Who asked you to hold me? Leave my hand! Sir, this won't work. Now let's do some policing. Take him away and question him. Let me question her. You shit! - No sir. I'll sort you out soon! - Try doing that! Let him go, man! - Sir, sir! - Move. Sir, listen to me. Don't question her alone. Will you decide that? Take him away. Sir, listen to me. Ask her whatever you want, in front of me. Leave your hand. If you do something on the middle of this road, and if people see it, Let me ask you. What's your problem? This girl shouldn't be questioned inside this car. That's all, right? Alwin... Keep the door open and question her. Why? - This guy doubts that girl, man! Or else will he do this on the road? Whatever. Take him away and question him. Come, son. - No, sir. I'll stand here. Get into my mouth then! Come, son. Don't you trust me? Then come. Come. Sachi... - Sir won't do anything to her. Did he do anything wrong to both of you till now? He didn't do anything, right? Even sir has two kids like this. But since we're policemen, we should ask something, right? And if you create trouble on the road, it will be a huge issue. That's all. That's what I said. Come. What's your actual name? My dear sir, what was I saying all this while? Check! This is my ID card. I work here. She's a 1st year MA student at Kottayam CMS college. We are in love. We came to this car park unknowingly! I hugged her! What do you want to know? We were saying the truth! Well, I didn't ask to make you feel bad. Since we're policemen... Vasu... Vasu... Sir! Vasu! Sir, open it. She saw who a real man is, now. Come here, sir. What happened inside was really funny. What this wimp said was true. She was smiling inside. - Vasu, what happened? What he said was true. He should say properly, right? Look. What? What's the problem? What did you do? She was smiling till now. She was smiling till now. She's crying seeing your face! Ask her to smile! We were talking, cracking jokes and laughing. Ready to let you go. Don't you want to go? Don't you want to go? Don't you? Then ask her to smile. Smile and go. Or else, I'll gather a crowd. Tell her. Vasu... Shouldn't we go? Then what! Sir... - Enough, man. She was smiling till now. That's what! Hey! Come out. Come out! Do you know, sir? - What? That girl is like my sister. We are going to let you go now. If someone else had caught them, you'd have known... Right? - Alwin, you know what time it is now? Take whatever the kids have and let them go quickly. Kiddo, take the girl and go home quickly. Didn't get the bottle too. I'm leaving. Where are you going now, sir? - I'm going home. Don't go, sir. We became friends, right? Couldn't drink too, and he's torturing the poor kids. - Sir! Then go! - I'll go! It's been 4 hours! Hey! What's your plan next? Are you going to roam around with her again? No. - That would be risky. No sir. We will go. I'll get a room for you, if you want. No. - You can wake up in the morning, freshen up and go. No, sir. We will go now. Then get inside. Did you eat anything? We'll go eat something. No, sir. We had eaten. We ate. - Let's go buy something. No. - She hasn't eaten. She is hungry. Right? - No, sir. We ate. She's not hungry. Do you know about her hunger? I would know it better, right? Get in. Let's go buy something. No, sir. She is alone. We will go now. No need then. We'll buy it from the shop there. That shop is open. Let's go there and come. Let her stay here. Don't be scared. Stay here. We'll go and buy something to eat. This is my area! Come. Let's go to that shop. What's it? Aren't you shutting the shop? Should I call the police from the station? The Hindi guys from the tile factory came and asked for a lot of stuff. What's there to eat? To eat.. there are bananas. Is that fine? Okay. Get me half a kilo. Do you want anything to drink? Get me a Mirinda. Cigarettes? - Only Gold. Gold? Pay it. How much, Chechi? - 160. You want a banana? - No. Come. Sit here at the back. Let's sit together. Eat my banana. You're really tired. It's been 3-4 hours since she ate anything. Ask her to eat the banana. Hold it and eat it. You want it? Oh! You're not hungry, right? I'm really hungry. Drink this. You'll be really tired. Why are you looking at me like that? Ask her to drink it. Ask her to drink. Drink this and go. Ask her to drink my water! This is my area! You know, right? I'm keeping this here. I'm keeping the banana here too. Sir, we will go now. Let us go, sir. Give me the key. Wait here, man. Let me smoke a cigarette too. Hey! Do you have to leave urgently? If it's urgent, you can go. Have you kept the money for some emergency? If it's for some emergency, no need. - No. No emergency. I'll pay it back. This is a debt. - No. It's the festival, and I'm running tight. - That's all right. Give me your phone number. I'll call you. Oh! Your phone is with me. What's your phone number? Sachidanandan, right? I'll keep calling. You should be safe until you reach, right? Can you please delete that video? I'll delete all that. You don't be tensed. Get going. Don't stop anywhere again. Everyone else won't be like me. Hey! See you! Seems like she's really upset. Vasu... What did he do to you yesterday? After closing the car's door, what did he do to you? After all that happened, is this what you felt like asking me? You didn't even ask whether I was okay! Vasu, stop. If you have sacrificed anything for us, tell me, Vasu. I am a man! I need to know! I didn't see any of this manhood yesterday, Sachi. Sachi... Hey Sachi... What is it, mom? What's wrong with you? You want the phone inside your toilet too? You've been in there for so long! What are you doing in there for so long? Let me do whatever I want to. Why do you care? Well, the groom's sister has come from their house. Please come out. 'Sleepless nights, and senseless mornings, dragged along, barking and crawling' 'The body shivered, the mind kept panting' 'While dying with the heat of the burning embers poured into the throat' 'I closed my eyes, and said softly' 'This too shall pass' 'The tune of the song that someone is singing within me' 'As it drops as flowers of tears' 'I am weeping, all alone' 'I am weeping' Hey! One soda! There's no fizz in this! Are you fooling me? Here. I'll be back. Who? The one who fought with Chakkappan? Yes. Him. I saw him at Vyttila yesterday. He's an Uber driver, I guess. Alwin, you got done early or what? Lost my mood in the morning itself. I took a child from Vypin. What happened? An accident? - Yes. A small child. That child died. - That's really sad. Alwin, did you get into a tussle with Murugan day before yesterday? Whom? That 'Shit' Murugan? Yes. Aren't you ashamed to fight with old men? - Old man, it seems! He should know his limits when he's drunk! What will you get by messing with him? Should I kiss him instead? Hey! 'Dog' Biju! - 'Dog'? Hey Biju! We need a dog. - For whom? For which Doctor? - Doctor Gopinathan. Let me ask my dad. He has a direct connection with dogs. - Yes. Your dad would know about dogs! You want two? Not two. Just one. Just one for now. Is it a cross-breed? - No. Direct. Who? You? Dad, is there any tall dog with us? Is pug a tall dog, dad? I'll be right back. - Don't say this to anyone. Hey! We have a dog! Okay. - He'll come in the evening for the dog. - Do one thing. Send me photos on WhatsApp. - Okay? - Try to arrange one, man. - We can booze with that, right? - Started already? - This will do for a full bottle in the evening. Hello! When did you reach? Why didn't you call me? Open it. Roll it down. Don't play around! Roll it down. Let me get inside. Don't play around, you **** Roll down the window, or open the door. Or open the door. Why are you staring at me like that? Roll down the window. Come on! I called you so many times. Why didn't you pick up? You stopped roaming around at night, and started roaming in the morning? What about her? What is it? Why are you acting tough? Have you come to trouble me? Get going! Scram! I let both of you go that day. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I'll go. I'll leave. - Then start the car. Scoot! Go! Get going! Get lost! 400 Rupees? Isn't that a bit too much? This is his routine when he meets strangers. Who's that? He's a boy from my native place. - Where? Near my house. Hey! Stop! Stop! What is this? - Where are you going? I'll come to your house tonight. Let's go. Okay! - Go ahead! Go carefully! - Where's 'Dog' Biju rushing to? He went to buy booze. - What about the dog for me? He keeps his word. Biju will bring the dog for sure. Who's over there? Whom are you looking at? What happened? Must be some kind of trouble! He's quite angry. Who's that boy? He's an annoying fellow who stays near my house. Oh! Was it? - Hey Alwin! Forget about the boy and the dog. What plans for this year's festival? As we had planned... Come home at 10 PM. - Will you escape? Is it your wedding? Is that how you speak? Then? - Asking if it's my wedding? Stitch it fast. - Don't get angry, Chechi. I will be angry, right? If we both get angry and explode, it will be a huge issue here. I need to take my wife and child to show them the lights and fireworks before that. Do that. - But last year, I lost 800 Rupees. No way. - No one has returned it yet. You just keep saying that you'll return it. - Don't buy some shady stuff. You bloody...!$! We must make him buy some good stuff this time. Stop! Driving into my mouth or what, you ****? Giving me scary looks? Hey! Hey! Biju! Someone take him away! Biju, calm down. Don't create an issue after getting drunk. No problem here, Chetta. Get going. Move! - Biju, listen to me. Have you gone crazy? I think your dad has come. I'll come now. You keep playing there, Miya. Isn't this Alwin's house? Yes. - Is he home? Ichayan (Husband) is at the hospital. - Is it? I wanted to meet him. He should be coming now. Is that so? Who are you? - I forgot to say that. My name is Sachi. Chechi, my phone ran out of battery. Can you please call him for me? When I called him earlier, he asked me to come here. Can you please call him? Mummy, it's superb. You and your superb! You keep drawing here. When dad comes, I'll go to the Church with him. Then don't cry saying that we didn't take you! Is it ringing? Yes. He's not picking up, Chechi. He must be driving. He must be about to reach here now. He had asked us to get ready to go to the Church. It won't affect your outing. I just need five minutes. Shall I wait then? Oops. Please sit down. Don't sit there. What's your name, Chechi? Mariya. The one who drew all this? Where is she? She is inside. - Oh okay. Miya! - Yes. Come here. Can I get some water? Oops! I forgot that. - That's okay. That's not Ichayan. Shall I make tea for you? Tea? - No. Water is fine. Why? Don't you drink tea? Not because of that. It's all right. I'll get you tea. Miya dear... An uncle has come. Go and see! Look who's here! Miya dear... Come. Come here. You drew all this? Then come. Let me ask you. Come here. Who is this? Who is this? Daddy! Daddy! Became friends already? She's always drawing. - I'll draw the rest. This is her routine. She keeps ruining the walls. Kids always draw on walls, right? But when they draw, they should draw in their own house. Let the kids draw! Mariya... Yes, Chechi. I'm waiting for Ichayan to come. You go ahead. We will come. - Chechi... Okay, Chechi. See you at the Church. Okay. I needed some more sugar. - Oh! I'll add it. No. It's fine. - No! I'll add it. Give it to me. It's all right. - I'll do it. Oops. It slipped, Chechi. And the phone also rang. I forgot to say that it's hot. That's okay. Did it fall on your Saree? - I'll do that. Oh no! - It's okay. Chechi, it fell on your Saree. It will go away if I wash it. Didn't I tell you? Move. I'll clean it. Move. Miya... - What is it, Mummy? Bring the First-Aid kit. - Okay. No, Chechi. It's just a small cut. Can't you stick a Band-Aid? It's okay, Chechi. I'll take it. - I'll bring it, uncle. Move to that side. You're a nurse, right Chechi? Yes. Didn't you have duty today? I'm on leave since it's the Church festival. Mummy, I can't find it here. It must be in the shelf, dear. Look properly. Shall I go and search, Chechi? I'm busy now. I'll call you. Hang up! Here you go, Mummy. - Keep it there. Didn't you say that your phone was switched off? Not that it was switched off.... It doesn't have talk time balance. That's what I meant. I'll go and throw it away. Just tell me where... Stick that Band-Aid. Chechi... If you put it there, won't it get hurt Miya's feet? That's okay. You will say that it's okay now. Just... What's wrong with you? Wherever I may be... What the **** is wrong with you? Hang up & get lost! Will he come anytime soon? Sorry. Suddenly I got a call... Will he come anytime soon? It's been a while, right? Move. He will come. Move. - Sorry, Chechi. I got worked up when I got that call. Miya... Miya, where are you? Where are you? I am here. Stop drawing! Don't spoil your clothes. I'll be done now, Mummy. Don't you know that dad will come now? Seems like there are many items, Chechi. Is beef curry the special dish for the festival? Can't find anything in this house in its place! Miya, did you see my phone? - No. That's a nice curry, Chechi. It's spicy! What are you looking for? Did you take my phone? No. What happened? No. You haven't returned my phone. I returned it right away! Chechi, tell me your number. Let's dial and see. Tell me. - Are you trying to fool me? First you told me your phone was switched off. Then you said you had no talk-time. I'll tell you when Ichayan comes. Can you please leave? No, Chechi. I have some balance. Tell me your number. Chechi, I have an iPhone. Why would I take your phone that stinks of fish? Tell me your number. Let's try calling. Only me and my child are here now. I'll tell you when Ichayan comes. You leave! Is it because I broke that glass? - What? Tell me the number. Let's try calling. Can't you understand when I say it once? Should I call my neighbours? - The kid will get scared! She'll get scared. Speak softly! What is this, Chechi? Why do you want to scare the child? Where are you barging in? I asked you to get out! Chechi, there should be a reason for everything, right? Or... If it's because I got your Saree stained... I'll buy a new Saree for you. Get lost! Chechi, what is this? - Step out! Don't create an issue. - Get out of my house! Chechi, what is this? - Miya, dear... Don't shout. - Where is Daddy's Miya girl? Are you ready? We have to go to the Church, right? What are you doing here? Do you know him? What is it? Sir... Where were you all this while? We've been waiting for so long! See... Miya dear, got scared. Ichaya, who is he? Sir... Tell her. Tell her who I am. Tell her about our relationship! Why have you come here? Ichaya, answer me first. Chechi... Cool down! It's nothing... I had stained her Saree earlier. It must be because of that. If it's about the phone, I haven't taken it. When did he come? - Didn't I tell you? It's been a while. Ichaya, can you please ask him to go? Chechi... Didn't I tell you when I came, ... that I need 5 minutes time? But 5 minutes won't be enough now. Daddy! What is it, dear? There's nothing to worry! Don't worry. You leave now. We'll talk later. What happened, sir? Got scared? You're the brave policeman of the town, right? Scared? Of you? If you come and show off in my house... Move! Didn't we ask you to leave? Why do you want to get beaten up by him? Go! It's nothing, dear. I'm really thirsty. Shall I drink some water? Ichaya... - You want water? Ichaya, leave him. - I will make you drink water! Dear, go and call John Chettan. You keep quiet. We're not calling anyone here. Don't call anyone! No problem. I will leave. Ichaya, who is he? You.... Chechi, I will tell you. You won't say a ***... It's nothing. - What happened, sir? Aren't you cussing? You get going! I told you to get lost, when I saw you at noon itself. Then why the hell have you come here? You thought you can attack me at my own house? Why are you silent? Didn't we ask you to leave? Why are you staying? I'll get rid of your arrogance! Ichaya... Please go! What did I do, Chechi? He was the one who did everything. Shameless dog! You bloody.... Chechi, ask him not to hit me. - Leave me. Leave me. - Chechi, please. Move. Ichaya... I'm going to break his face! Move. Enough! That was a bit too much! You're over-reacting! - Shut up! Don't hit me. - Move, Ichaya. Don't do anything more to him. - Why should I move? Who asked you to invite him into the house? Invited him into the house? Didn't he come to talk to you? He's saying that even now! Will you invite whoever comes to talk to me, inside our house? You won't understand anything now. - What? Sir... She didn't invite me. I came on my own. You... - Ichaya! What do you want now? You want to talk to him, right? Go ahead! Talk! - What's he going to talk? Get going! Don't get beaten up by him! Okay then. I'll leave. Why should you both fight because of me? Dear... Don't be scared. Uncle will leave now. That was one hell of a slap, sir. Stop blabbering and get going! Ichaya, our daughter is here. Ichaya... - Chechi.. Shall I say one more thing? Don't say anything. Get out! I've been asking for 5 minutes time since I came, right? No. Did I behave indecently to any of you till this second? To you or your daughter, Chechi? Ichaya... But sir was the one who slapped me twice, for no reason! So, without saying what I have to say, and without lisening to what I want to hear, should I leave after getting slapped by this pig, you #!%%^@^? Ichaya! Daddy! Ichaya! Mummy! - Ichaya! Leave me. Leave him. Leave him. Leave him! Ichaya! Leave him, I say! Someone help us! Come fast! Help! Mummy! Uncle, no! Leave my daughter! Keep quiet! - Leave my daughter! I'll kill her! Shut up! - You!! Let my child go! Dear... Leave my child! Miya... Miya... Don't be scared. Your daddy hit me first, right? Not me, right? If someone hits us, shouldn't we hit back? You finished hitting him, right? Can't you go now? Chechi, I asked only for five minutes ever since I came! Sit there. But what can I say to this broken guy now? Sit there. Daddy! Dear... - Mummy! Apply some cotton there. It has gone inside the wound. Or you do it, Chechi. You're a nurse, right? Do it, Chechi. There are glass pieces in the wound. Miya... Isn't this a game, dear? In the game that day, your daddy was the policeman... and I was the thief. He made me cry a lot for no reason. There's blood coming out of his mouth, Chechi. Clean it. Ichaya... Miya... Leave my child! I'm scared! Why are you scared of me? Did I do anything to you? If you don't listen to me, I'll become angry. Tell me, dear. Whom do you like more? Daddy or Mummy? Tell me, dear. Won't you say it? Do you like daddy or mummy more? Tell me, dear? Is a banana stuffed in your mouth? Say it, you... This is Alwin! It won't end with this. Did anyone say that it would end with this now? You're yet to realize... Realize what? You don't know this Alwin. If I know it, would I pee or what? Yes. I would have made you pee. Had I known that you were such a guy, I would have made you pee. Not just you! Even her! Sir... Lost it, right? Lost what? Lost what? What the hell did I do for you to attack me in my house? No. Is it paining, sir? I'll forget everything you did to me. If you do anything more over here, you'll leave from here only in a coffin. First stand on two legs, and then bark, you dog! What more can you do to me? Alwin! - What is it? Hey! Stop it. Alwin! You loser. Go there and call. Just bark loudly, man. Open the door, Alwin. Hey! Ichaya, keep quiet. My daughter! I will light her up! What is it, Biju? Isn't anyone home? There's light inside. - He has escaped, man! Escaped? - This rascal always does this when he has to spend money. Then why are we sitting here? He asked us to come in the evening, right? - Give the stuff. Come on. Should we finish it now? - Give it. Biju, give me your phone. Let me try calling him. It's ringing. - That's what I also said. Where's the glass? Pour some water & drink, man Dude, don't finish it. You know where he would actually be now? Either at the Church... or he must have picked up some item and taken her to bed. He has stopped all that. Yeah right! Where's the other glass? He just has to see clothes on a stick. He'll go behind that. Biju, tell him about that incident. Oh! That scuffle with Murugannan. Some schmuck had brought a girl to our parking lot that day. Ah! Bring it on! I heard that our man took her to some corner near our canteen and had her nicely. Since that guy was a schmuck, he didn't tell anyone. I swear! When there's such a hot item at home, what's wrong with him? Mariya is super hot, right? Are you getting goosebumps hearing her name? - Of course. Shouldn't I say the truth? - He doesn't value her when she's with him. You have the rest. Here. Dude, let's go. - Dad is calling. Must be about the dog. Oh no! It's dad! That's what I also said, right? - Yes, dad. My dear dad, don't keep asking this all the time. Dad, is pug the tall dog? Send a photo on WhatsApp. - Not peg. Pug! Mariya... I don't know what you did to him. He would have killed my child now. I'm asking this for the hundredth time! Who is he? Mariya, I haven't done anything. Don't imagine unnecessary things. Don't believe what he's saying. Don't imagine unnecessary things. Hey! Stop it. Enough! What did I do to suffer so much? I let you go, right? Don't mess with my family! I forgive everything you did. Now you leave. Ichaya, I want to know. Mariya, I will tell you. Let him leave. You go now. Go! Mariya, believe me! Let him leave. Hey! Go! Sir, I don't feel like stopping this. Mariya! Don't stop it! Here! Kill her... and then kill me also. Do whatever you like! Ichaya, let him do whatever he likes. But I want to know. We will suffer after that! I want to know what my husband did to you, for you to react like this! Do whatever you want, man! Tell her. Tell her. Shall I tell her? No. Tell her that I haven't done anything. Tell her I haven't done anything. I saved you when a crowd was about to gather, right? I saved you when that Murugan came, right? I bought you food, and let you go happily, right? Didn't I call you till you reached? But you were the one who didn't pick up! I must have said 2-3 cuss words since I was drunk. That's all, right? Let it go. I didn't do anything else, right? What did you do to her, closing the car's door? What? What the hell did you do to my Vasudha, closing the car's door? I didn't do anything. Hey! My child... My family... Go! Should I go? I will go. I'll go. But if you sing the song that you sang that day..., I'll go. That 'other' song. Sing it, sir. Or leave that. Ask me to go with a smile. Then I'll go. Say it, sir. Hey! - No, Ichaya. He doesn't have to go now. I want to know. Go! Sir will say it. Can you sit here, Chechi? No! Don't! Sit down, Chechi. Sir will say it now. Mariya... You...!! Did you kiss her? Did you hug her? No, please. I'll fall at your feet. It's not that. Then... Did you do this then? Stop it. I'll say it. I'll say it. Believe me! I swear! I swear on my daughter! Mariya, it happened somehow. Let me go, at least for the sake of my family. I'm falling at your feet. Forgive me. I'm stopping all this forgiveness, sir. There's that itch on the tip of your manhood, even when you see a guy & a girl just talking, stop that with this! Before messing with us again, remember that there will be people to come and attack you at your house, you dog! Chechi, sorry. Shouldn't I do at least this much, Chechi? Minimum? Mummy... - Mariya! Mariya... Dear... Mariya... Dear... Mariya, it happened by mistake! Didn't I tell you, Mariya? Mariya, it happened unknowingly! Mariya, please. Dear... Tell your Mummy... Mariya... No, sir. Please! No! No, please! No! Do you want to go? Tell me. You can go! I'll let you go. Give me a kiss and go! Just one kiss, right? Please! Please! No! Just one kiss! Please! - He won't know! No! Give it. Please! Please! No! Leave me! Leave me! You...!! Hey! Hey! Don't cry! I'll let you go! Get up! Get up! He is coming. Don't cry! Smile! Come on, smile! Sheesh! Hello! Vasu... I want to see you right now. I'll come to Kottayam now. I'm in front of your hostel. I can't see your face. Come under the light. What happened? Can you give me a kiss? Vasu, I need to meet you. I'll be in front of Mamman Mappila hall. My phone is low on battery. It might turn off. You just come there. Okay then. Good night. Bye. Let's go. Sachi, stop the car. What happened? What do you want to know? We'll proceed only after you know that. One minute. Come. I did it by mistake, dear. I swear! - Chetta... Do you have money to go back? - No. Here. Which is this place? Ask around and go. I shouldn't have joined that guy... I need an answer, Sachi. I know everything. You did whatever I should have done that day. Forget it. No, Sachi. If he had done something to me that day, would you have dumped me? Shall I wish you for your birthday now? It's been a long time since I slept properly now. When I think about it, I'm reminded of them. When strangers pass by this way... Their first question is this - 'What are you up to here?' 'We want to know what you were doing. We're from this area.' This is indeed an ideal park. You shouldn't come for any hanky-panky here. You can see the face, right? Why did you look at a girl in a Burkha, while you were in the hospital? Chetta, my friend was waiting there. I am sorry! Will you ogle at girls? - No. I am sorry! It's been one month since the moral police attack happened at Kollam Azhikkal beach. Death threats from the accused's friends.... If he hadn't been beaten up by them, they would have attacked me. They said my husband looks like a Hindu... They said that it's not my husband and hit him. I was 5 months pregnant... So if something had happened... Four people came out asking, where are you going, why did you stop here? They circulated the visuals through social media. Depressed about this, Anish, from Agali in Palakkad, hung himself to death. Police arrested a couple while they were talking by the canal, took them to the station and questioned them for hours. They said that I look like a Muslim, and asked whether she was indeed my sister. If those bullies showed some humanity, we could have saved one life. Though they have complained to the police, no actions have been taken yet. We won't let anyone lie on anyone's lap here. In a complaint that the police themselves became the moral police in Trivandrum, Neglecting their claim that they were married, they were abused. And they were pushed into the jeep. They were dragged out and beaten. Both the husband and wife were beaten up. They said we should be tied up at home and punished. 'Don't show your wedding chain' 'You'll get it for 50 Rupees in the market' 'How many husbands do I have? How many wives does he have?' 'If you're husband and wife, what's the third guy doing here?' I consider him like my younger brother. No one should suffer this fate. I'm scared to talk even to my friends now. Because I'm scared of any more problems. According to me, that person should be arrested, the one who took Nirbhaya to such an atmosphere, where she had to face such a grave attack.
