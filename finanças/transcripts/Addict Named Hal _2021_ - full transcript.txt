And I remember this guy standing up and sharing about this girl that he was talking to, and he woke up in the morning and she was dead. - Hmm. - I think you're falling asleep. And he shared about it, right, 'cause the two of 'em met in a recovery house, and they started seeing each other, and couldn't get a 60 day key tag between 'em both. - Come on, give me your phone. - Why? I wanna put my number in it. And she died. And he said, "You know that's what happens to a dope fiend." And then I got to thinking I was with this girl once... Hey, new girl. No phones in the meeting. - [group laughing] - I was. Anyway, me and her, we shot up, and it was the first time she had ever done that. And she OD'd, man. I didn't even call it in. I was fucked up. I've had to learn how to forgive myself for that. And y'all taught me how to do that, because y'all have done some really fucked up shit too. [group chuckles] Took me about eight years to put one year together, but man, I got 18 years now.

[group clapping] At this meeting we give out key tags for varying lengths of uninterrupted sobriety, uh, including weekends. Anyone have 30 days? [group clapping] Hi, I'm Zachary, and I'm an addict.

[Tony] Oh, fuck. - Shit! - What the fuck? - Shit, shit, shit! - Don't fucking do this to me. - Call 911. - Oh, we can't do that. - I have warrants out. - What? They're probably looking for him after last night anyway! Shit. Um. Uh, do you, do you have the, the, the thing? The, what, what's it called? The fucking, the... - Naloxone? - Yes. - I don't have that shit! - Uh, shit! Um, wait, wait, wait. Please, God, please, please, please. Yes, yes! Okay, here. - What the fuck is this? - It's Naloxone! I don't know how to fucking use this! It says you, it says you spray it up his nose, so just go ahead! I'm not fucking doing this, man. Fine, fuck! Okay, okay, okay, okay. Um... Okay, all right. - It's not working! - Do it again. Okay, okay, okay, okay. It's not working. Fuck! [Tony] This is so fucked, man. - [Hal coughing] - Oh, okay, okay, okay. [Tony] Oh, thank fucking God, man. Okay, Hal. Hal. Hal. [Tony] Is he okay? Hal. It might have been to fucking late, man. 'Cause like you had to hit him like twice, and sometimes people still fall out, man, because like the drugs hit their system again. Okay, okay. Okay. But he's breathing now and so I think we should just take him to the hospital. And fucking hand him over to get locked up? Okay, better locked up and alive than here choking on his own vomit. [garage door whirring] [Amy] Okay, okay, okay. - Okay. - [Tony] Let's go. [Amy] Okay, okay. - [Tony] The door. I'm gonna get it. - Okay, okay, okay. Fuck. [panting] Hurry up, hurry up, hurry. Okay, one, two, three. - Fuck. Okay. - [Tony] Watch out, watch out. [Amy] Okay, okay, okay. Shit, fuck. [Amy grunts] Okay, okay, hold him, hold him, hold him. [Amy groans] Fuck. Okay, okay, get his legs in. - He needs to sit down. - Okay. Oh, my God. [Tony] I'll drive you but I can't go in there with you. [Amy] I know, I know. [Tony] They're gonna ask you a bunch of questions you're not gonna wanna answer. [Amy] It doesn't fucking matter, Tony! - [car door shuts] - Oh, fuck. He threw up again. Hal? Hal? - I don't think he's breathing. - [Tony] Fucking shit. Check, check his pulse. [footsteps running] [Tony retching] [Tony retching] Okay. [Amy whimpering] Got him? Careful. Oh, God. [melancholic music] [Amy crying] [Bradley] So I'm standing there, right. And I thought the pills would sink down to the bottom of the fish tank. But the motherfuckers started to float. So she comes in and I know she sees the pills, she's gonna kill me. And she's already suspected, right? - Right. - So she's all yellin', "Bradley, were you buying pills again?" So I put her like right in front of the fish tank so she can't see nothin'. Then I'm all yelling too, like, "Ma, you crazy? Of course I wasn't buying no pills." And then meanwhile, bloop, bloop, bloop. They're fucking falling out of the filter and into the water. - [laughing] - So she turns around, and she sees these pills just going around and around, and I'm in even more trouble 'cause I'm getting my sister's fish high. [laughing] [Andrea] Oh, no. - [Amy] Tony. - Hm? How did you start using heroin? How's anyone start, man? Okay. It's not like a great story or anything. My mom had knee surgery, I was maybe 15, and I was all mad 'cause I brought a girl home and she said it was wrong. So I took her painkillers away. Not thinking I'd take 'em, just I wanted her to hurt like I hurt. And it occurred to me, what if I take one? And it felt good. Figured if one feels this way, what'll two do? Nobody ever thinks they'll become a drug addict. What do you do if you start to think it? [Tony scoffs] Man, I'm the wrong person to ask. - [group laughing] - [birds chirping] [Bradley] Man, yeah. Oh, now here's this motherfucker. Girl, you don't care you got a curfew around here? Sorry. What's my bag doing there? Oh, Rich packed it. You can just go knock on his door. Yo, Amy, you didn't lose track of Hal, did you? We was suppose to check out a new meeting today but I don't know- Did you leave together? Oh, they left together alright. They're just heading out for more of that sweet, sweet love. [knocks] [door opens] Shit's on the porch. I need to talk to you. Searched your room last night. Found your little bottle. The cops, they came by here this morning too. But I know you know what that's about. You're in deep shit, Amy. Rich, I don't. [sighs] What do you wanna say now? Bring Hal with you? [Amy crying] No, Hal's dead. [Rich laughs] Fuck. [Amy crying] Fuck. I, I need help, Rich. I don't, I, I know I don't deserve it, and I know I'm realizing it way too fucking late but I, I don't know what else to do. I... So now, now you want my fucking help? [sobs] Yea. Where's Hal now? He's... The body's in the woods where someone will find it. Fuck, man. [crying] I didn't know what else to do. Please, Rich, I don't have anyone else to go to. Alright, alright. Brad's got his sister's car. Alright, he's gonna take you to the emergency room, and you're gonna tell them you got withdrawals, that you're gonna kill yourself. And they're gonna put you into treatment from there. Okay. Okay, okay. I wish I could say that I hadn't done worse shit than what you done today. I really wish I could. [Amy crying] This is the only place we don't run out of chances. Now you're gonna have to take the help that's offered you. Can you do that? Yeah. Bradley, will you take me to the hospital? Shit, of course. You're gonna be okay, girl. Where's Hal? [door closes] [Tony crying] [turn signal ticking] [phone ringing] [Amy] Hi, Mom. [poles tapping] [traffic humming] [door opens] [door creaking] [door closes] - [phone beeping] - [phone buzzing] Hey, Ma. Hey. I'm so sorry, I... I had house stuff, and... [Mom] She can't wait to talk to you. Put her on. Daddy. Hey, little girl. [Aubrey] You didn't call, Daddy. I know, I know, baby. Um, Daddy's had a long morning. [Aubrey] But it's only 8:30.
