(suspenseful music) (door clanking) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (upbeat dance music) (people chatting in club) (women talking softly) (speaking in foreign language) - Hi. (speaking in foreign language) Oh, sorry, don't speak Spanish. - Oh, well, I was asking, are you waiting for someone else? - Ah, very nice. - Where are you from? - No, no, no, I'm alone, I'm alone. Please, sit down, sit with me. - Really? Thank you, okay. - I'm Thomas from Wales. - Wales? - Like Prince Charles. (laughing) - Prince Charles, wow. - Would you like to be my Diana? - Oh well, I would prefer not to end up dead on the Alma Bridge like her, but... (all laughing) Dark humor. I like that. - A drink? - Yes, sure. - Whiskey, champagne, wine maybe? - Mojito? - Two mojitos. - Yeah, two mojitos, please. - Mojitos. Wow, good decision. - That's okay. - Wait here. (dance music continues) (speaking in foreign language) (dramatic music) (speaking in foreign language) Okay, two mojitos. - Thank you. - Thank you. - For the most beautiful - Chilean ladies. - Oh, do you wanna know the names of those beautiful Chilean ladies? (all laughing) - Cheers. What is your name? - My name is Lily, she is my friend, Natalia. - Oh, Lily, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, Thomas. - Nice to meet you, Natalia. - Hi. You too. - Thank you so much. - Now, cheers again. (upbeat dance music) - Ah yes, we became friends since she came from Venezuela. Yeah. - Yes. - Really? From Venezuela. - Yes. - Like Miss Venezuela. - Exactly. - Wow. Wow, wow, I can't believe that. (all laughing) - Hey Tom, you said you're a lawyer, didn't you? - Yeah. - And tell us, what is it you are doing here? Where do you work? - I came here for some meeting representing my client. I was in the North. - The North? - Yeah. - That's cool. - Have you heard about the lithium? - [Both] Yes. - Yeah, yeah. - Lithium? - Lithium. That is the future. And the future is my business! Yeah, yeah. - Your business? - Well, well, well, well, that sounds amazing. - Like, amazing. - Like making lots of money! - [Thomas] No. - Yeah, you're making lots of money! - Not really. Oh, yeah, okay. - And tell us tell us something, what about our future? Do you see something good for these beautiful ladies? (laughing) - Please, give me the candle. Here. (inhaling) Well, now that you mention it, I see something, yeah, a message from the future. Both of you - [Natalia] Hmm? - in my home! (all laughing) All of us together, happy, so happy, wow! (speaking in foreign language) Chile! Please, don't stop, don't stop. - Wanna bet? I just made a good friends and bad man. - Please, could you not drink, what the fuck? Sorry. Would you drive me home? Sorry, I'm drunk. - Oh my God. - Please. - We need to think about it, we need to think a little. - Yes, go. - Are you cool? - Yes. - Well, you can tell Tom, the green magician, yes. - What? (all laughing) - Sorry. Cheers, ladies. - This is the last one. - Cheers. - And this is for the future. - Okay, okay, okay. - [Lily] The one for the future. - [Thomas] Oh my gosh, wow! Come here, come with me. - Oh my God. - [Thomas] Come here, come. Wow. Do not forget the key. - You never said that you were so drunk! (all laughing) You're crazy! - The light! Wow! Okay, go, please. - [Lily] Let's go in. Where's your house? - [Thomas] Wow, here. - [Lily] Which one? - [Thomas] Please, please, my home is your home. - Oh, it's a nice place, very beautiful. - Very nice. So cute - As nice as the owner! (Lily and Natalia laughing) Tom, are you a lawyer or a YouTuber? (laughing) - [Thomas] A YouTuber? - I mean, it looks like you spend many hours inside this place. - [Thomas] Oh, really? - It's dirty! (laughing) - [Thomas] This body need food. - Oh well, that's for sure. - Yeah. - Sure. (speaking in foreign language) (suspenseful music) - Hi! Which one you prefer? - Wow. - Cabernet, or a Cabernet Sauvignon? - Cabernet, of course! - Of course! - Good election. - [Lily] Very good election. - It's okay. Glasses. And one for me. - Do you have a corkscrew? - Yeah, yeah. Here. No. No, no, no, no. - Hard to find. He's a little not fixed. - No. I know, in this room. Come with me. - Okay, I'll go with you. - [Thomas] Yeah, please. (suspenseful music) Get it! Wow! (clapping) Amazing. Beautiful. Wow.

(speaking in foreign language) - So we can have a cheers again. - Yes. - And again, and again! - Yeah! Cheers. - Delicious - Yeah. (all laughing) (suspenseful music) - I think it's time for something. - What? - Yes. You have to prepare for a special surprise. - Yeah? - You have been waiting all the night. (both laughing) - Yeah. Wow. - I wanna see this empty as we come back. Bye-bye. - [Thomas] Beautiful. So beautiful. - Thank you. (suspenseful music continues) Bye. (speaking in foreign language) No, no, no. (speaking in foreign language) - Yeah, no sweat. (speaking in foreign language) (both laughing) (dance music) - Woo hoo-hoo. - [Natalia] Hey, Thomas. - Yes, very good, very good. - No, no, no. - Relax. - No. (dance music continues) (both laughing) (dramatic music) - Hey! Hey, hey, Thomas, Thomas. Thomas! Hey, hey! Thomas, Thomas. - What? - [Natalia] Hey. - Calm down, calm down. Hey, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing? (screaming) - Please, what are you doing? No! No! No! (dramatic music continues) No. No, stop, please. No, stop. Lily, Lily! (dance music) (speaking in foreign language) Lily, let's go! - Okay, okay, okay. (dance music continues) (suspenseful music) (speaking in foreign language) (eerie music) (both coughing) (speaking in foreign language) (both laughing) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (both laughing and cheering) (speaking in foreign language) (Natalia coughing) - Naty? Naty? - Lily. (eerie music continues) (coughing) (both coughing) - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. (speaking in foreign language) Hey! (dramatic music) Hey! Naty, Naty! Nat! Naty, Naty! (speaking in foreign language) No. No. (crying) (dramatic music continues) (Natalia coughing) (instrument buzzing) (sighing) (gasping for air) (screaming) (breathing shallowly) (Lily screaming) (horn honking) (gasping for air) (gasping for air) (speaking in foreign language) (gasping for air) (gasping for air) (speaking in foreign language) (gasping for air) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) - [Natalia] What's going on? (gun blaring) (speaking in foreign language) (sirens blaring) (suspenseful music) - Buddy, just breathe. Look at me, look at me! You're gonna be fine. Can you tell me how many fingers I'm holding up? Doesn't matter, just keep breathing, okay? And please, please don't die on me! The ambulance is almost here, you're gonna get fixed up good as new. No buddy, no, stay put. Do you want your bag? You want your bag? I'll get it, just don't do that shit anymore. You're freaking me out. Hey! Hey! (suspenseful music) It's coming, it's coming. It's me, I called! - What's happening here? - This guy was crossing the street when a truck hit him. - [Paramedic] Why did it happen? Did you get the plate number? - No, man, they drove away, it was so fast. - Definitely a concussion, probably internal bleeding. Broken ribs. The lung may be punctured. Look at that foam. - I didn't move him. He tried to get up. I tried to put him in that safety thing. (man groaning) Got his bag here. - [Paramedic] Not now! - Yeah, sure. I was thinking, you know, the ID. - Go away. (suspenseful music continues) - Stay with me. (dramatic music) (man groaning) - [Owen] So, this is his bag. - Give it here, you know this guy? - [Owen] No, I was just out. - So you can't drive with with him, sorry. - Fine. - We are taking him to St. Lawrence, so if you want to see him you have to go- - He's unresponsive! We gotta go! - [Paramedic] Go! Go! (siren blaring) - [Owen] You're welcome! (dramatic music continues) I'm not saying I wanted a hand job from the Mayor, some thanks woulda been nice. They barely looked at me. - I'm sure that they appreciate it, hon, they were probably just really busy. - [Reporter] No news on the location of the Chilean scientist suspected of illegally spreading toxin and biochemical substances. - I know, it's dumb, I just... I'm freaked, okay! This guy went flying in front of me, he was all bloody. - Aye, aye, aye, aye, you did great. Wow, you're sweaty. (sniffing) Do you think you wanna go visit him, see how he's doing? - No. I don't want it to look like I want something from him. - I'm sure that he's gonna be happy to see the guy who called the ambulance. You saved his life. - What if I didn't? What if I take the bus all the way there and it turns out he died? Then I'd just be bummed. Can you take the day off tomorrow? - No, I have to go to work, Owen. - But I was traumatized, I don't want to be alone all day. - Well, you don't have to be alone all day. - I looked at the listings, nobody's hiring. Not me, anyway. - Oh, don't you sulk now. You know, I might not be the Mayor, - [Owen] Uh-huh. - but... You know? - I know. (sighing) (upbeat music) Fuck. (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) Babe, I was thinking, why don't we eat out tonight? My treat. I found some cash in an old jacket. You just pick a place, somewhere nice, romantic. (dramatic music) (burping) (crunching) (slurping) (gagging) - [Stella] Hey. Still no fever though. Here, drink some of this. - Thank you. (coughing) My throat hurts. - Are you okay? You scared the hell out of me when you called me at work. - [Owen] I feel like shit. - I know. It's okay, you just got a bad stomach bug, it serves you right for eating all that Chinese food of mine. - You think it's funny? - Oh. (coughing) - I was puking when I started to gag shit. I couldn't breathe! - Oh, don't get that tone with me, Owen. Not after I had to ask Rhonda to cover all the rest of my shift, okay? - But it hurts! - I know, I know, but get some sense of measure. Think about the guy you saved last night, don't you think he had it worse? - What? Why are you talking about him? - I'm just saying that maybe seeing something like that could give you a little sense of perspective. - I'm sorry. - It's okay, just get better. Do you think you can eat something? - I can try. - [Stella] Hmm, hmm, hmm? Oh, aye, oh. Okay. I guess you were hungry. (suspenseful music) Okay, my little sloppy slob. You wanna try to get some rest? (coughing) It's only gonna be for a couple of more days. Yes, and I'll be back on Monday for inventory, yes, yes. Honestly, I thought it was just a bad stomach bug. But, you know, it's been two days now, and I don't wanna risk it, I feel awful. Yeah. No, I'm constantly hungry, all the time, it's just I can barely keep it down. And I get shivers all over my body. I sweat like a hooker or something. What? No, that's just something that my grandmother used to say. Anyway, I'll see you on Monday at work. Okay, thank you, thank you so much, okay, bye, bye. (coughing) So, I think they bought it, I've got a couple o' more sick days at work. Still no fever though. That's good. (dramatic music) Owen, slow down, you don't wanna puke this one too! - I'm sorry. - It's okay. - I'm just starving. - It's okay. (rock music on TV) - The light it's hurting my eyes. - Sorry. - It's okay. Maybe I should lie down. Can you? - Sure. Come on. Here, lean on me. (coughing) (wheezing) (coughing) - [Owen] I'm sorry. - [Stella] It's okay. - [Owen] Babe! Babe, bring me a glass of water? My throat hurts! - Shit! (dramatic music) (coughing) (wheezing) (knocking on door) - One moment! One moment. (knocking on door) One moment! (dramatic music continues) Jesus, you got it too! (coughing) (coughing) (wheezing) (somber music) (groaning) (Stella groaning) Baby, baby, look, my nail. - Shut up! I mean, seriously, I just finished puking my guts out, could you waited 10 fucking second before you show me your next boo-boo. - I have a boo-boo. - I waited on you hand and foot the entire week. God, it's never enough with you, isn't it? You're so fucking needy. Do you realize that I could get fired? I could get fired from work. What are we gonna do then? What's gonna happen? - Don't you worry about that, I have some money. - Oh. - [Owen] I know I'm already taking care of rent, but... - Oh my God, buttering up your racist grandma so that she's gonna let you stay here, it's not, it's not taking care of rent. It's not, it's mooching. You need a job! - I told you, nobody's hiring! - Did you call them? Did you call? Did you call any of the con file that I left you last week? - [Owen] Yeah. - How many? How many of them did you call? Owen? - [Owen] Do not. - Oh, not even one fucking call. Not even one fucking call. And yet you had all the time in the world to pester me at work. - You're right, I wanted to call. - No, no, Owen, no! No, no more excuses! How many times have you been lying to me? - What? - Is that the reason why you don't wanna go visit that guy? Is that the reason why? Did you make him up too? Did you make him up too? - It was like I told you, I saw him get hit. - So where did they take him? Tell me where did they took him? Saint, Saint? - I do not remember! - You do not remember! You don't remember. Oh my God, that's so fucking convenient! - I can't remember! (laughing) (dramatic music) Do you really think that I would lie about something like that? Why? - [Stella] Why not? - [Owen] Help me. - No, no, no, - Believe me! - Don't you fucking dare, don't you fucking dare! Can you prove it to me? Prove to me that there was a guy. Prove to me that you saved a guy the other night. - I can't. (whimpering) - Oh my God, I cannot fucking believe that I believed this. I cannot fucking believe it. - [Owen] It's not like that! - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You stay fucking there, that's your fucking spot, right? Isn't it, isn't it, isn't it Owen? - I swear, I saw him get hit. - I don't give a shit, I don't care, I don't give a shit anymore. No, no. You stay there. - Help me. - I'm gonna go to my sister, okay. And you better check yourself into an hospital because I'm done, I'm so done playing the nurse. - [Owen] Wait! Wait a minute. - Owen, get some fucking dignity, would you? - Don't leave me. Don't leave! (yelling) (dramatic music) (doorbell ringing) (dramatic music) (doorbell ringing) (dramatic music) (doorbell ringing) (Owen wheezing) (dramatic music) - Hi! It's 27.50. Thank you. Wow, you really like this stuff, huh? Well, take care, see you soon! - Who you judging? (wheezing) (suspenseful music) (wheezing) (groaning) (dramatic music) (somber music) (thunder clapping) (wheezing) (crying) (dramatic music) (thunder clapping) (wheezing) (dramatic music continues) (wheezing) - [Stella] Will you eat, will you eat? (dramatic music) - I fucked up. I know, I'm a mess. I can't do anything right. But I'm sick of it. I'm sick of feeling like a monster. (dramatic music) (thunder clapping) (bodily fluids pouring) (dramatic music continues) (doorbell ringing) (Owen sniffing) (doorbell ringing) - [Child] Trick or treat? (grunting) I like your mask, mister! - [Stella] It's over, Owen, stop calling me. You're not gonna change, I know it by now. I knew who you were when I took you in, but I didn't care, you know. I thought you were sweet and cute. So I thought I could help you get your shit together, but I wasn't helping, I was enabling you. You need to learn how to stand on your own. I care for you, I love you, but this is not enough to plan a future together. You can't live your life on somebody else's couch, you can't eat and watch TV all day. You need to make something of yourself. Give something back instead of constantly taking. I know you don't like leeching off me, I know you feel guilty about it, but that doesn't make it okay. That guilt will only fester if you don't do something about it. It's time to grow up, Owen. You need to make a change. (lock clicking) (door creaking) (Owen wheezing loudly) Owen. - [Owen] Sorry. (Stella crying) (Owen wheezing) (soft music) - Owen, Owen, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. Shh. No, no, no, no, no. Shh, shh, shh. It's okay. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. (wheezing) I'm sorry. Shh. (Owen sniffing) We'll get through this. We'll get through this. We'll get through this. We'll get through this. We'll get through this. Okay? - [Owen] Okay. - Yeah. (dramatic music) Together. (somber music) (dramatic music) - Even if in the world their beauty's chanted, admired, and reached out. Should have never been considered as a game. All are in search of something in this existence. But goals are becoming all similar to be selfish, to be beautiful, to be rich. But how many of them can really get this? We need the right people to realize our dreams. And also, we need to be the right people. That's why I asked you not to wear makeup, I am the only one who can consecrate you to the absolute beauty. To the one that all aspire to. But I need to see if you deserve it. (dramatic music) And you do. If you let my treatment reshape your body you will not have anything to envy to be world's best top model. You will be amazing, divine. Human beings are so imperfect, but thank God we can improve ourselves. Plastic surgery, it's easy, but people's trust not. They spend 1,000 of euros just for some few injections. (dramatic music) That's why people like me exist, they give perfection the right price. (dramatic music continues) - Fuck! (yelling) (dramatic music) No. (yelling) - We are done. (suspenseful music) You were already beautiful, but now you are a goddess. (dramatic music) (cell phone ringing) - [Eva] Laura, finally, how are you? - [Laura] I'm fine, thanks. - [Eva] Great, any news? - [Laura] I have a great news, yeah. And the phone number that you will need. - [Eva] You mean you called her? - [Laura] Yeah, yeah, exactly, I called her after Bruno's suggestion. He told me the treatment on his wife was perfect, perfect. - [Eva] Oh my God, this is so exciting. So how was it? - [Laura] Well, you have no idea. She didn't even ask much, and in just one appointment made me amazing. - [Eva] Oh, unbelievable! So you did it? Was it expensive? Was it not painful? - [Laura] Yeah, crazy I cannot believe why people pay thousands of euros for a clinic. - [Eva] 'Cause if it's cheap people don't trust it. - [Laura] Yeah, that's what I say. - [Eva] We must need to meet up. I really want to see what she did on you, I really need to do something with my lips! Why don't we meet tomorrow for a coffee by Bruno? - [Laura] No, come to me tomorrow so you will see all the details! - [Eva] Perfect, I'll call you tomorrow when I'm near your house. I have a client now. Ciao, sweetheart. - Okay darling, see you tomorrow, bye. (somber music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (machine whirring) (dramatic music) - Laura? Laura, are you there? (dramatic music continues) (clicking on steps) (dramatic music) (Marco moaning) (moaning) (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) - Marco, I love you too, bye. (suspenseful music) (groaning) (suspenseful music continues) (whimpering) (groaning) (cell phone ringing) - [Answering Machine] Please leave your message. (beeping) (sighing) (clock ticking) (suspenseful music continues) (cell phone ringing) (groaning) (clock ticking) (cell phone ringing) (scoffing) (dramatic music) (cell phone ringing) Please leave your message. (beeping) - Doctor, please, I have some stains on my skin and some bumps, maybe I'm allergic to something. I don't know, please call me back. (crying) (cell phone vibrating) (gasping) (dramatic music) (groaning) Fuck! (crying) (dramatic music) (gasping) (dramatic music) (groaning) (grunting) (panting) (gasping) (cell phone vibrating) (sighing) (dramatic music) - Laura? (dramatic music) Get naked. - No, no, let me suck your dick. - I paid, and I wanna see you naked. (Laura groaning) (Laura whimpering) (yelling) (groaning) What the fuck? (man groaning) (dramatic music) (laughing) (dramatic music) - Laura? (gasping) Laura, what happened? (dramatic pulsing music) - I just wanted to be beautiful. (eerie music) (dramatic music) - I don't know where to start. It all began in the upper class, the high society. That's where the virus started. It was a designer drug, the idea was you'd inject yourself and have the ultimate high. They made and event of it, they had parties. It's kinda sick when you think about it. But it makes sense if you have too much cash on your hands. Of course it all spun out of control and before you know it, half of the world's infected. (dramatic music continues) My son is infected. He's dying. He's dying because you had to play God. He's dying for your pleasure. Word is there's an antidote. You can always count on the pharm industry when there's money involved. But people like me can't afford it, it's just too expensive, plain and simple. First you make money with the virus, then you make money with the antidote. I'm scraping together everything I can but we're running outta time. I've isolated him. And I found a way to keep the virus at bay. - [Connor] It's hurting me! - [Father] Connor, I don't know what you need! - [Connor] Cut it out! (crying) Cut it out! (screaming) - There's a town nearby with a functioning wi-fi signal. I'm gonna upload this video in the hope that someone sees it and helps us. Please, please help us. Please don't let my son die. (dramatic music continues) ♪ Happy birthday to you (somber music) ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday, dear Connor Go on, make a wish. (Connor breathing shallowly) (father laughing) Well done. You okay? Any more attacks? - [Connor] No. - And I got some more money from town. We're almost there, all right? But you're gonna have to hold on a little longer, okay? Just a little longer. You hungry? Huh? All right, there you go. One more? (suspenseful music) Fuck! (dramatic music) Fuck. (dramatic music continues) Connor! (Connor screaming) (dramatic music) Connor! Connor, what the? (flesh squelching) (suspenseful music) Connor, get away from there. Connor, get away! - [Connor] No! - [Father] Get away from there! (Connor screaming) Come on, I've got you, I've got you, okay? - [Connor] No! No! - I've got you. (dramatic music continues) - [Connor] Dad, it's starting again! (screaming) - [Father] Where? Connor, where? - [Connor] Forearm. (crying) (Connor screaming) (Connor screaming) (soft music) (crying) - I don't know how long I can take this. (soft music continues) (birds chirping) (rain pattering) I don't really know if these videos are good for anything. It's more like therapy for me now, so. Yesterday I had to witness one of the worst things I've ever seen. (dramatic music) The virus is causing an insatiable hunger in Connor. And we're running out of food. I tried to give him everything I can, but food is scarce. Last night he crept out. And when I found him he'd bashed a fox to death and was eating it raw. He can't die. He can't die, I won't let him die. There has to be a way to fight this. I have to save him no matter what it takes. I know he won't be the same afterwards, if and when we get through this. But at least he'll live. I started to the west side so far, so I'm heading east today to see if I can scrape up some more food and money. (dramatic music continues) Connor? You awake? I'm heading into town to get some more food. Will you be alright on your own? I'll hurry. (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) Connor! Connor, you won't believe what I found. (Connor screaming) (dramatic music) Connor. Connor, Connor, Connor, where does it hurt? (dramatic music) Connor, you have to show me where the pain is! (screaming) - I love you. - Connor! Don't die! Connor, don't, help! Don't die! Don't die, no, no, no, no, no. Don't die! Don't die. Connor, don't, no, no, no, no, no. (father screaming) (groaning) (dramatic music) (screaming) (crying) My son is dead. I tried everything to save him, but I failed. (suspenseful music) And now I'm infected. But I don't have anything to fight for. I have lost everything that mattered to me. And we weren't even close to the money we needed. What should I have told him? That there was no hope? Should I let him have died without hope? (suspenseful music continues) I hope you get what you deserve even if I'm not there to see it. (dramatic music) And I hope you suffer as much as we did. (dramatic music)
