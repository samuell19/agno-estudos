What time is the Russian due in? Two o'clock. Mr. Chan said we should be very careful. The KGB will stop at nothing to get him back. You don't suppose they're going to try one of their fake reception committee stunts, do you? I doubt if they'd pull that on Bruno. An old intelligence operative like him would spot that trick in a second. So far they've answered all our signals. Good, he doesn't suspect a thing. This is like taking candy from a baby. I can't believe the CIA haven't interfered with us yet. You don't suppose we've been overestimating them? Welcome to freedom, Mr. Bruno. Thank you very much. Please watch your step, sir. We're not out of danger yet. Goodbye, sir. Thank you, my friends. What's going on? I don't understand. Those two are probably tourists, but we can't be too careful. Hands up. Drop that gun. Just keep moving towards the car, sir. We'll keep those two covered. I've got good news for you, Colonel. Your man was safely intercepted at the last minute. So I've heard. He's on his way to Washington right now. That's swell. Don't let me interrupt you, do sit down. That was a close one. I knew you would bring it off. Nobody suspected they'd try that old trick. Don't laugh, it almost worked. Oh, would you please have this film developed at the usual drugstore? Certainly, sir. We certainly appreciate all you've done for us. We of the Chinese-American community are proud to serve our adopted -- And the money's not bad, either. Mr. Bruno, you were in charge of the insurgency program for the KGB. You seem to have some kind of secret weapon. No bullets, but plenty of dead adversaries. I've got a strange feeling this technique you've been using isn't all that new. As a matter of fact, you have hit the nail right on the head. What we have done, basically, is add the modern technique of auto suggestion to the ancient Chinese martial arts. The result is a human killing machine. Of course, the men have to be in perfect physical condition and completely trained in a wide variety of different fighting styles. What about the auto suggestion? We have developed a method by which... by which, you might say, the fighters can put themselves in a kind of hypnotic trance. In this operation, only the Killer instinct remains alert. They even lose their sex drive? So would you in that state. You've certainly supplied us with a wealth of information. I'm pleased to help the cause of freedom. It's good to have you aboard, sir. Thank you. That was pretty mind blowing, sir. You guys are really on the ball. Thank you for -- It's an honor to be associated with a professional like you. Thank you. Now, how about some real American hospitality? You are very kind. I'll bet you're hungry after that long session. Well... Where the hell are the security guards? Right at our front door. Is this your idea of freedom? I tell you, heads are gonna roll for this. How in blazes did they get a sniper on the CIA lawn? I don't believe it. One of our own people. Here's the file on that killing, but as far as we're concerned, that Russian never set foot in the United States. Stop making faces, Sanders, this is the CIA. Sometimes, we play rough. I know. Now we're supposed to find ways and means of copying this Russian fighting technique. I don't know who this we is you're talking about, you're the martial arts expert. Would you please tell me where I'm supposed to find that -- Easy, Sanders, ours not the reason why. How about paying a call on that venerable gentleman who taught you all you know? The Chinese connection? All right. I know when I'm licked. If you can't stand the heat, then get out of the kitchen. That's what the man said, I'll get back to you on this one. I sure hope he can help us. Hold it, this is private property. If you don't want your face rearranged, get lost. Listen, if you hold these for a second, I can prove I'm a friend of the boss. You call that fighting? You guys never learn, do you? Oh. Not so fast, buster. Halt, who goes there? Not another beginner. Pleasant dreams. Where's Mr. Chan? Right in back of you, turkey. I thought you were a fighter. What's this flower power routine? Watch. Huh? You old devil, you haven't changed. Something nice for your lapel. Now then, to what do I owe the honor of your visit? I'm on a confidential mission for the agency. We've just discovered the Russians have developed a new technique of martial arts. Oh, there's nothing new about that technique. We've known about it for centuries. As a matter of fact, there's a man teaching that technique right here in the United States. His name is John Liu. Right here? Well, not exactly around the corner. He has a school somewhere in the suburbs of Santa Barbara. He calls his technique Zen Kwan Do. He's a real hotshot, champion of the world. Twice. He and his brother are native born Americans. He served in Vietnam. When he got out, he said he was so disgusted with war, he never wanted anything to do with the military again. Since then, he's become a pretty good tournament fighter. All the belts, championships, you know. It's ironic, his identical twin brother is still serving in the military. Something to do with a liaison in the far East. Far East? I suggest we bring him home on a recruiting mission. This time, destiny got there before we did. The twin was injured in a car accident. He's recuperating on his brother's ranch right now. Well, how's the patient doing? Okay. It takes more than a car accident to put me out of commission. Right, being tough's an old family tradition. Listen, I thought about what you told me last night. You know how I feel about war. I think you're going to have to be the patriotic member of the family. John, I wasn't asking you if you'd like to get involved with the CIA. I was telling you what you're going to have to do. You know how Uncle Sugar is. No way he's gonna take no for an answer. He's not gonna get a yes outta me. I'm looking out for number one. What's so goddamn funny? For a guy who's been all over the world, you're awfully naive. If the government wants your services, they know how to make you volunteer. Not this boy. I wouldn't be so sure of myself. Even a macho like you has his weaknesses. Blow it out your ear, brother dear. You'll see. Take my word for it. You won't win this one. I win them all. Put down the groceries, honey, you're coming with me. Easy does it, honey. Get your hands off me, you low-life creeps. Get her. Oh, please help me. Those men are trying to molest me. Get back here. You stay outta this, mac. Going my way? Save yourself! Run. Come on. Let's get out of here. I live just around the corner. Come on. Talk about a knight in shining armor. You've got a great place here. My brother and I were really lucky to find it. Here. Thanks. I just don't know how to thank you. Nonsense. Don't bother. Well, it's a wonderful day. You wanna go for a swim with me? Mm-mm. I'll just sit here for a minute. You go ahead. Now, don't be shy. If there's anything you want, you just say the word. I'll just enjoy the view for the moment. This place must cost your brother an arm and a leg. He's in the service. They pick up the rent bill. Don't wait for me. Enjoy your Coke. I just wanna dry off. You're not going anywhere, friend. Now I get it. You're the CIA recruiter. My name is Sanders. I've been assigned to tell you Uncle Sam wants you. We need a man with your abilities in the organization. You don't say. We're starting a very ambitious martial arts program and we want you to be in charge. Who, me? No way. I'm not interested. Can I see that? You are good. Listen. Will you stop playing games with me? You just do your job and I'll do mine. I can prove I've done my military service. I've got better things to do with the rest of my life than get mixed up in foreign intrigue. Here. Thanks. Mr. Liu, you're an intelligent man, and you should have realized by now that's not an invitation, it's an order. If the police find out what you were doing with my wife... hmm, San Quentin express. Your wife? Mm-hmm. Well, what do you know? So that's where it's at. I don't know why I thought you guys played fair. There's an old Chinese saying, "If you can't win, there's no point in playing.‚Äù We like to win. Now, why don't you go back to your house and say goodbye to your brother? My brother? I should have known. Bastard. Mr. Liu? Yes. Welcome. Major Sanders is expecting you. Thanks. Home, sweet home. Thanks for the ride. You can do better than that. Harder. Okay, next guy. I gotta warn you, you got a new coach coming. He'll teach you the meaning of work. Hold that steady. You call that steady? Every one of these guys is an honors graduate from a major college and they're all well-trained In the traditional stuff, knives, handguns, rifles. They're all in good physical condition. It's up to you to make good martial arts fighters out of them. Think you can? How do you do? I'm Dr. Staff. They call me The Brain Backer. I'm in charge of the computer system. Yes, if you want to check any of the personnel records, all you have to do is come see me, or one of my assistants can help you. Caroline, this is John. What a happy coincidence, I was just showing John around the data processing system. John's the new martial arts coach. Better watch out for him, he's a real killer. Oh, Doctor. Now, Caroline here is the lady with all the secrets. She's got her fingers on everyone's most intimate details. Dear, why don't you show John around? You're welcome to pry into most people's private lives, but please don't ask to... to see any top secret material. Of course not. Lead the way. John, why don't we start with the usual stuff, place of birth? John, I hope you appreciate this is a top security installation. It would not be in your interest, or ours, if I authorized full access to offices. All restricted areas are clearly marked. Well, I won't have much time for exploration, anyway, will 1? Fine. This way. Ah! I said I don't want to hear one word outta your mouth. Please. You've got to stop it. I can't stand this torture. I can't... Ah! We've all gotta go through this endurance training. It's the only way of helping us out. You think that's painful? Wait until the enemy gets you and wire your balls for sound. You don't get your act together here, you're a dead man. Now brace yourself, man. I'm upping the voltage. Compared to what the other side will give you, this is nothing but a children's game and there's no getting out of it. Someday, you'll be grateful. One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. I've been watching you guys train and I think you stink. Sergeant. Hmm? Yes, sir. Sir? College graduates? A bunch of hillbillies. What is this? Why are these men barefoot? All the Chinese fighters we've seen in the movies took their shoes off first, sir. Can the joke. Shut up, Wong. You work for the Playboy Club? If you think it's too long, I guess I could take off an inch or two. It all goes, Sitting Bull. At ease, clown. You guys really think you're hot stuff. Mr. Chan, you're going to have to help me. When you got me into that CIA unit, you didn't tell me I was going to be tortured. Those people are crazy. Mr. Chan, have you heard one word that I said? Huh? You've got to get me out of that unit. If there's one thing I hate, it's a coward. Endurance training is all part of the standard program. If you can't take a little punishment, don't come crying to me. This was more than punishment. I tell you, if you don't get me out of there, I'll kill you. Sit down. Stop it immediately. I want you to return to the camp. Forget it. Listen, I won't stand any back chat from cowards. The rest of you return to the house. So you want to kill me? I'm not afraid. You haven't got enough courage to Kill a mosquito. Don't make me do it. I've got to get outta here. Anne, could you do me a favor? Sure. What is it? The Colonel needs a printout on Johnny Wong. The guy with the long hair? That's the one. You mean the freak out? We don't know that, do we? No more, enough! Since 1953 I have worked for the CIA, hypnotizing people and knowing their thoughts, all the employees of the agency have to go through my hypnosis and brainwashing sessions. You know, if you paid more attention to your work, you'd feel a lot better about yourself. Really. I know from experience. All right, you win. It's good to have someone to talk to. Now I'm going to make a swordsman out of you. The trick is to fight without drawing the sword. Beg your pardon? You heard me. Now watch. Look out, here I come. Okay, I give up. It says here your name is Susan Armstrong, born in Summit, New Jersey, Master of Arts from Vassar. And you wanna learn the martial arts? Yes, sir. If you don't say. Shall I show you what I've already learned? Hmm, so you've had some previous training in grade school. You think you're pretty clever. I don't wanna argue with you. What? Well, then why don't you fight? You got a deal. Let's see what you've been taught. Okay. That was very funny. I knew a loud mouth like you once. She wound up with no eyes. This is no ballet class. Watch it. Not funny, Sergeant. You're all right. You've got a lot to learn. Wanna show me some legwork? Leg straight, waist firm. The other leg. Go ahead. That's fine for the Rockettes. Needs work. Now, let's see you attack. All right, come on. One, two, three. Watch carefully. That's how the grownups do it. Now, this is the kind of style we're aiming at. Oh, what a wonderful lesson. You're cute. Susan, if you don't feel like working, we can quit and you can transfer to another unit, sewing flags. Sergeant. This is a garrote. You know how to use it? Now you can try it on me, or perhaps the sergeant would like his collar size reduced. Damn. You crazy idiot. What's the matter with you? Somebody help me. Hold steady now. You sure came along in the nick of time. Thanks. Lady with the secrets. Can't afford to lose you. See ya. Can I treat you to dinner? What do you say we... we go Dutch? Picnic? Mhm, great. Love it. You're on. Hey, come on. I wanna try something with you. In the middle of the park? Are you crazy? Come on, Caroline. Come on. Lie down. I love this. Would you like an orange? Later. How about a little game of catch? With that? Are you ready? Let's have it. Go on. Okay, now it's your turn to catch. Ah, you idiot. This way, sir. Well, Pasco, how's that new instructor doing? I've got my reservations about him. Frankly, I don't know why he's here, sir. We've had a perfectly good martial arts program here for years. I honestly don't see where we need someone from outside the camp. Has he introduced the self-hypnosis phase into his work yet? No sir, he hasn't. He does practice some kind of mumbo jumbo every day in the courtyard, but I think we better run some kind of test on him before we let him start teaching the men a lot of stuff we may have to unteach them. If you wanna run a test on his technique, that's fine with me, but I want some results on my desk this week. You'll have them, sir. I want to have a man attack him. To test the pain response? Exactly. Good morning, sir. Hello. And then we want to take a look at the old sex drive. Susan Armstrong's preparing a seduction test, which may prove very revealing. If he passes that with flying colors, then it may be safe. Morning, sir. I think that makes a lot more sense than hitting our valuable personnel with a lot of untested oriental kicks. Well, then test him and get it over with. Yes, sir. Hi. Hi, tough guy. In the mood for some wrestling? Oh, I forgot to salute. Cut the comedy. I'm really not amused. Oh, this isn't comedy. And if you don't believe me, look at this. How do you like that little weapon? I don't want you training with any weapons until your legwork improves. Come on, cut it out. Good morning, sir. I suppose you're gonna tell me you were practicing self-defense tactics. Listen sir, I... It's the newest Chinese teaching method. It's a little unconventional. Listen, I'm getting a little sick and tired of all the funny remarks. I didn't ask for this job, you guys. Easy does it, John. Susan, you really put your body and your soul into your work. Good for you. Thank you, sir. Hey, penny for your thoughts. What? Oh, oh, sorry. Tell me something. Okay. I don't know who's crazy, everybody in that camp or me. Sexy Susan crawled all over me and when the Colonel caught us in the act, he congratulated her on a good job and that long-haired kid... Could we talk about something else? Mhm. Sir, I really can't stand by and let this guy do what he's been doing to the recruits' morale. Everybody on the base hates him. Really? With one exception, that is. One of our key computer people. As a matter of fact, they spent the night together. I don't know what his game is with her, but I'll tell you this, it's gotta stop. Don't get too close. Hey. Come on. What's in that shirt? Next time I'll hit you goons with a court martial. Hi, honey. Good morning, John. What have you got in the box? A little surprise for Wong. I've been looking for him all over. What happened to everyone? We usually work out right here at this hour. The men are all out on a field exercise. Whenever the Colonel comes in, they have to show off. I wonder why nobody said anything. Hmm. Do you think...? Hmm? I wanna get to the bottom of this, for once and for all. Fire! All right, men, reload your pieces. Hadn't we better go back? You can if you want to. I've gotta find out where I stand. I hope you're doing the right thing. Ready, aim, fire. Hello, John. Morning, sir. What brings you here? Somebody told me it was Johnny Wong's birthday. I got him a little surprise. Oh, great. Wong, front and center. Yes, sir. Your tutor's got a little surprise for you. Come over here. Nice weather we've been having. They said this morning on the radio it might rain this weekend. Here, a present for you. Huh? I checked your records and discovered you were born in the year of the rabbit. Go ahead, open it. Happy birthday, Johnny. You mean it's mine to keep, sir? Right. Gee. You're going to have to cut down on sweets. Oh, shucks. Look at the size of him. Isn't he adorable? Hi, fella. Hi. Any minute now, we'll turn on him. Do you read me? You are very tired, very tired. You need to rest, you need to rest. Do you hear me? You are very tired, you need to rest. You have been in service for 25 years and rest is necessary. You need to rest. Wong, obey your instructions. Hope this will cheer you up a little. What? Do you think you can buy me off with a stinking rabbit? Get this and get it good, I'm sick and tired of you making fun of me. I swear to God, if you ever have the nerve to come near me again, I'll kill you. That's what I'll do. I'll kill you and I'll kill you. Very good, Wong, keep it up. Why do you do that? Why? Why do you torture me like that? Can't you gimme one good reason, you son of a bitch? Ah! A rabbit! Come here. Don't run away. Goddamn it, Wong. Come to your senses. Don't try it. I'll get you for this. My rabbit! My rabbit! Give me my rabbit! It's mine! It's mine! Do not be sad. They are all crazy. Come on Caroline, you don't scare that easy. Are you trying to challenge me to a boxing match? No. Wrestling. How do you like this hold? I like my holds a little closer. Do you really? Try it, you might like it. What do you make of that business with the kid this morning? I told you there are things I can't talk about. Can't we leave it at that? Hmm. But why do they force me to come here and then do this? There are some things you just have to accept on faith. You don't really believe your country would bring you here with no rhyme or reason? I'm honestly starting to wonder. All right, you guys, look alive. Yeah, that goes for you too. Hey, fix your hat, man. More like it. Hey, what's the matter with you, John? Ain't you been getting enough sleep? I'm all right. I must have dozed off. Take off a little weight, I'll make a fighter outta you. Not as long as they got rifles. Hey, keep going. Nobody gave you guys permission to stop. Yeah, some college they must have went to. Good morning, sir. Feel like practicing what you're gonna show your teacher this afternoon? Yes, sir. All right. Pretend I'm him. Listen, Wong, I told you the purpose of this test was to measure his resistance to pain. Now come on, hurt me. Listen, you're gonna have to do a whole lot better than that if you really want to hurt him. That's better. You've been toughening up just the way I said you would. I think it's about time you learned a couple of dirty tricks. Hey, nice work. I never knew you were such a pro, Pasco. Really? Thank you, teacher. Mind if I have a quick word with Wong? Have a slow one if you want. Thanks. Look sharp. Hey, you've got a lot of potential. I just wanted to tell you... when we run the auto hypnosis test this afternoon and you attack me, I really want you to give it all you've got. Try to wipe me out. All right. I've got a little assignment for you. I want you to put the make on our martial arts instructor again. Thanks, I've done my last number with that gentleman. Don't you talk back. I won't say this again. You're expected to do exactly as you're told. Get your filthy hands off of me, you creep. I think you'll be disappointed after you run that test. If Mr. Liu comes through successfully, as I think he will, I'll expect you to apologize. Keep me regularly informed over the walkie-talkie. Yes, sir. Susan. I am the field chief, you hear me? Listen carefully, you must follow my orders. Your instructor is marvelous. Now practice what you learned at the camp, use it on the instructor. Wong. These are my orders, attack the instructor. Attack him immediately! Let's go! Wong, stop it! Listen John Liu, no matter how much strength you have, you will not be able to resist the control system! Oh, yes, John Liu. John Liu. Do you hear me? It's not worth resisting. There is no escaping my control. You have to listen to my command. Can you escape? Can you carry out my orders? You cannot avoid it. Susan. Are you ready? You are the best in our unit. Attack the instructor. Obey me. Go now. Don't waste time. He's tensing up. Now he's prepared. I'm sending in the attacker. You laughed at me, now die. He's got pretty good control, but he can't resist the girl. What's he made out of, wood? Don't worry. It's only a matter of time. If he doesn't respond to this, he isn't human. He's starting to weaken. Good work, Susan. No, sir. I don't think I owe anybody an apology. I wouldn't be so sure about that, Pasco. The electrodes on his body haven't registered one change since he went into his trance. Don't touch that dial, sir. Now he's moving in for the Kill. He's starting to lose control now, sir. How's his electrode reading? Steady as he goes, Pasco. Are you sure you and I are monitoring the same event? Okay, you two. I should have known better than to trust a couple of beginners to run this test. Get back to the base. You too, Susan. Sir, I think Susan may need another couple of toughening up sessions. Did I pass? You did. I even have to offer you an apology. Well, in as much as neither one of us is very thrilled about having to work together, I suggest we make the best of a bad bargain. What's that supposed to mean? I think we can learn a lot from one another. There isn't one thing that I could learn from a civilian, buddy, and I think the time has come for me to prove it. I accept the challenge. You may be in for a surprise. Why don't you just shut up and fight? The last guy that got funny with me wound up with no eyes. Gentlemen, now that that test is out of the way, I hope you're satisfied that I'm legitimate. Are there any more doubts in your minds? I never doubted you in the first place. What about you, Pasco? I'm convinced, sir. So, what's the problem, John? I wanna resign. I can't teach self-hypnosis to Westerners. I doubt if anyone can. It's something you almost have to be born with. It's just a matter of setting your mind to it and you've got a splendid mind. Sir, I don't think you've heard a word I've said. I can't possibly make this technique work. Hold on. You're just gonna have to find a way to do it. That's what I meant before about him not having a military approach to things. You do as you're told, otherwise... If you don't shut up, I'll... Let's simmer down, John. Why don't the two of you sit down and behave like civilized adults? Let's forget we ever had this conversation. We don't normally accept resignations from anybody. John, you're in the claws of the CIA. The claws of the CIA, indeed. Have you ever heard anything so ridiculous in your life? What am I anyway, a slave? That's not so far from wrong, John. What are you talking about? All I can tell you is that you belong to the CIA as long as they feel like using you. The best thing to do is accept it. Isn't there any way I can get away from it? I really shouldn't be telling you this. You know, we're not so far from the Mexican border. Planes leave Mexico City for everywhere in the world. I'm not about to become a fugitive. Why should I do that? I haven't done anything wrong. I think I might write a letter to the president. John, no. Don't you realize how important you are? You have no recourse to appeal to anyone. But this is worse than prison. They have no right to hold me like this. They have whatever rights they need and the power to exercise them any way they see fit. I can't crawl over the border alone, like a hunted criminal. You won't be alone, John. You didn't think I'd abandon you at a time like this, did you? Not after all you've meant to me. Make sure you keep those classified documents well hidden. Nobody can touch us as long as we've got them. I've organized an interception detail. They won't get away. Here they come now. We leave for Paris next week. It was the first booking I could get. I don't like it. I don't feel safe here. John, look out. Get down fast. Try to calm down, darling. By tomorrow, we'll be out of here. You sure know how to calm a girl down and get her excited at the same time. One move and she's dead. I wouldn't try that unless you want the lady's throat cut. Now, hand over the harpoon. Move it. Get him fast, John. Caroline, are you all right? Start the ship. Sure you're okay? Yes. No. Caroline? Caroline?! I'm not gonna make it, John. Run away... Caroline! Caroline! Hodgekins, Operations. Anymore on the Liu case? We think we've tracked him down to Paris, sir. And what do you propose to do about that? We're having him shadowed day and night, sir. Sooner or later, he's going to have to lead us to that classified material. That was some pretty nice shooting, Pasco. We can't afford to miss him, man. Now, that kid must think he's hot stuff, but we know he hasn't got a chance. We know even the smallest details, he has a gym in Paris and goes out with a very rich widow named Fanny. She is a famous model and has a son and a daughter. Liu trains every morning in front of the Eiffel Tower. Sir, he just picked up his girlfriend's kid from the apartment. They seem to be on the way to his new school. Uncle John, mommy said it was all right if I had an ice cream. Right. All I have to do is pay for it. Well, there's a place. Let's see what they've got. Well, what kind do you want? Chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, buttered almond with soy sauce? My favorite is coffee. Can I have coffee? Sure, but you get exactly one scoop. I don't want you to ruin your appetite. If you don't eat your dinner, your mother will hand us our heads. What's in the paper, Uncle John? What do you care? I take Current Events in school. CIA denies any complicity in the Mexico yacht murder. Bastards. Waiter. Oh, excuse me. Punch him out, Uncle John. Come on. Oh boy, you're the best. I think we better move on. I'm not fond of our fellow diners. Bah! We've tracked him to the tourist boat dock on the banks of the Seine, sir. You think he's planning to escape? On a tourist boat? No. I think he's waiting for somebody. Hi, honey. Hey Mike. How you doing? It's his secretary and her kid, sir. Josette, I've got to leave Paris. They found me here. Let's talk about that later. Maybe you don't have to leave. I have friends who can hide you. You've got it. Bye. I'm afraid we'll have to ask you to come with us. Just keep moving, everything will be okay. Keep moving. Momma! Keep moving. You get that kid under control. I'm from the CIA. Now, you come here, young man. Hey, that's John's girlfriend. Grab the child. Stay right where you are, girls, or you're dead. Get in the car, fellas. I told you we couldn't get anywhere near him, sir. He's got fighters posted all over the city. If only we could just eliminate him. We can't. Not as long as he knows where that classified material is. Oh, God. Even the kids a killer. What a collection of creeps. You've gotta admire the guy's nerve, operating a school under his own name. You wanna try this rifle? Now, this is the routine. Hands off of him for the time being, but anyone who goes anywhere near him IS eliminated with extreme prejudice. In other words, gentlemen, we shoot first and ask questions later. You got that? Yes, sir. We start with the girl. Yes, sir. George, you wanna put her away? It will be my pleasure. Hey, you're not delivering any messages, lady. We're not fooling, lady. Stop just a minute. Wait a minute. John. What's the matter? You've gotta help me. Someone just called Josette and said that she would be killed unless you give yourself up. He'll really stop at nothing. Can you take a message to her? That's what I've been trying to tell you. It's -- You've delivered your last message, lady. Blood. John. Josette, no. Get out. Get your hands off me. You touch that girl and you're dead. I can wipe you all out. Don't move. Don't you dare. Ah! Josette. Josette. Don't let him get away. Stay where you are. I'll get you for this, Pasco. You're not going anywhere. Mr. Liu, if you'll just tell us where those papers are, that's all we need to know. Cooperate with us and we'll cooperate with you. Otherwise, you haven't got a chance. Just leave me alone, gentlemen. This is official business, sir, now please... Here's my identification. Oh, shit. Oh, where the hell's my gun? Oh, here. Mr. Liu, if you don't want sore kneecaps, you better come with me. This just isn't my day. Now. Heya! I've never had a case like this in my life. He swears he won't leave Paris until he's settled the score with you. You clowns weren't such goddamn amateurs. I'm angry right now. Get to work. The place where James Liu lives, California, United States. Dear John. What can I tell you? I warned you back in California that you're powerless to fight the whole CIA. Besides, what's the point of trying to take on the legitimate representatives of your country? Take my advice, turn yourself in and return those classified documents. You say I got you into this mess, now I've got to get you out. Only you can get yourself out. Love, your brother James. Maybe you can get me out, Jim. I think I may have to appropriate your identity for a little while. Can you book me on flight 128 to Barcelona? Hey, John. Wake up. Come on, John. Wake up. What time is it? Time to wake up. I get the message. John, would you teach me how to -- Good morning. John, a messenger from the airline brought you this. Come on, Billy, let's play. Okay. See you later, John. And these look like his glasses. His cheeks are a little fuller than mine. He parts his hair in the middle. James, I hate to do this to you, but you didn't ask my permission to get me involved in this crazy situation in the first place. Ladies and gentlemen, Iberia announces the departure of flight 128 from Paris to Barcelona. Passengers are kindly requested to proceed to gate number four. John, I'm on my way to Germany I will divert attention from you by making a call to the US Embassy, and telling them that I have something in my possession that proves the innocence of my brother. It seems to me you can take the plane without any risk. Is this our man, or James Liu? General, we have the wrong man. We have killed James Liu in his car. We should try and catch up with John at the airport. Yes Sir, I'm going there. Message for passenger Liu. Passenger Liu, kindly report to the stewardess. My name is Jo -- I'm Mr. Liu. Yes, sir. I believe you have a message for me. Oh, yes, here you are. Thank you very much. Uh huh. John Liu. We have your brother. Get off the plane if you want him to keep living. We will meet in the suburbs of Paris, in a town called Boulogne. Murderers... It's all my fault. What a dirty move. Ugh, well, look who the cat dragged in. Hello, Susan. What the hell are you doing here? I had myself assigned to surveillance duty because I wanted to see you again. I'm here on a top priority mission for the agency. I know all about it, "The Coach." Then I suppose you have some information where our subject is hiding. What do you mean hiding? We followed him from the airport. He gave us the slip. We know for a fact he hasn't flown anywhere else. He must be hiding. He wouldn't know how to hide. He's wandering around Barcelona like a perfectly normal tourist. He was just waiting for you to come along. Oh. You expect me to believe that? You can tell that story to the Marines. If the Marines wanted to engage Mr. Liu in combat, I think they'll find him in Anna's ceramic shop. I'll get you the address. Excuse me, aren't you Mr. Pasco? I'd like to ask you about my brother. Oh, John Liu. You didn't expect me to believe that masquerade, did you? You're a professional. I knew you'd catch on sooner or later. Only it isn't going to do you that much good. You see, Pasco, I've come here to Kill you. I came to do the same thing to you, as soon as you hand over those files. No way. You bastard. There's two kids without a mother, thanks to you and your wipeout squad. Don't get your insides in an uproar, my friend. I think it's time I taught you one or two hard facts about life. When brave men are fighting to preserve democracy, the occasional innocent gets caught in the crossfire. It's never pretty, but it's how things are. Nonsense. You're perverted. You're all sick. You don't believe that yourself. When I release those files, it's the end of all of you. I'm not finished with you yet. Ah! Don't move. Ah! What's this all about? I don't know. Hey, what's happening? I don't know. Colonel, I'm not afraid to use this gun. All right, men. Hold your fire. Satisfied now? You'll be sorry you did this. You drop your gun, too. I'd like that briefcase back. Thank you. Now, all of you, keep your distance. Don't anybody get any smart ideas. Well, you're the boss. Where do we go from here? You get on that aircraft and prepare for takeoff. Come on. Now, listen carefully. I'm not gonna say this twice. You contact the tower and -- Look behind you. What's matter with this plane? Give me that thing. Ont! Goddamn it, open this door. Open it. Colonel, I'll get you if it's the last thing I do. You guys taught me how to use these things. I see you're running out of oriental tricks. You killed everybody I ever cared about. Now it's your turn. I'll kill you any way I can. Nobody wanted to kill those women. You forced us to do it. You could have turned over those papers, but you had to be the big hero. I have nothing more to say to you. You'll pay for all those lives. If you don't want your men killed, then get 'em out of here. You heard what he said. Get moving. And shut the door. I think you're right, John. We've talked long enough. Go ahead, kill him. Come on, shoot. Let's get this over with. That was an order. I said an order. I want this animal killed. Watch out. You know, I've learned to take orders now and I've been ordered to kill you, but I won't need this pistol. Hmm. I'll do you in with your own weapons. Once you told me to wipe you out, now watch this. Ha! You were right all along. They're just criminals. You are right. Now what the hell am I gonna do? You already made up your mind. What in blazes is the matter with this plane? What the hell are you doing here? Hands up. Sit down. Just keep your mouth shut and you won't have any trouble. Wong, Mr. Chan told me to save the file. Hey, Wong. Quick. Get in. The hell with them. Get those papers. Hurry. I'll kill them all. Now watch me take care of Mr. Liu. I don't understand why you gave him the papers. In a few minutes, those files won't matter anymore. You'll see. General, I don't think we need this pilot. He's got a parachute. Maybe he better use it. No way. You heard the man. Jump. I'll jump when | goddamn feel like It. You fellas have no right to order me around. We are CIA officers, you better do as you're told. Your superiors are gonna hear about this. I'm as superior as you get. Now, jump or we'll toss out your body. You monkeys are gonna pay for this. Just send a bill to our Washington office. I sure will. My God, how did this thing get in here? Throw this out the window. Colonel, what's wrong? Ah! Two more dead. Does this mean we're murderers? That wasn't murder. Hm-hm. Sometimes you have to get rid of vermin so the decent people have a chance to live. What happens to us now, John? We find some place where the two of us can start again. Wong, to coin a phrase, "I think this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship."
