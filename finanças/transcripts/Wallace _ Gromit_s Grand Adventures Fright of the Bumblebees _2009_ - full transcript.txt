Right, first time, Graham. Another perfect landing your turn to make breakfast Gromit eggs, I think. And toast with honey today. Step to it, lad. I'm famished. Oh, honey piped directly from the source. Everyone in town will want their own honey tap when word gets out. Oh, no, No final demand, oh hell, no, my payment due now, no disconnection. Nothing but bills grommet. I can't look at these before I have my breakfast. If we don't find some steady customers soon, I don't know how we'll make ends meet. Alright, then I'll open one. But just the one. Hmm. Seems your subscription to marrow growers monthly is up for renewal. Don't suppose you'd consider cancelling. So not. Better payoff then. Now, where did I put my pen? Oh yes. Now, that's what I call a breakfast feast wasn't so difficult, was it lamb with a hearty plate of eggs and toast under my belt? I'm ready to take on the world Gromit. I have a strange feeling this is the day our fortunes are going to change. Warning volleys. May I have a word If it's about yesterday's little mishap? Oh no. You see, I can assure you it was an accident, Mr. Pinner, and I'll certainly pay for the damage to your grocery shop. I was just putting the sniffer 3000 through its paces. It's still only a prototype, you know? I realize that Mr. Wallace, What better place to test out a cheese detector than in a shop with such an excellent selection of cheeses happen? But you'll still have to pay for the damage, I'm afraid. Yes, of course. I'll put it all right. The funds are how can I put this a little tight at the moment only until our new business is up and running high? Well, that's what I'm here to talk about. I understand you and Gromit are in the honey business now. Fresh deliveries daily from B to you. Oh well, perhaps I can help you get on your feet. I'm having my annual sounding of the crumpets festival and I'm clean out honey. Can you deliver 50 gallons, 50 gallons by Tonight? Tonight it more than cancel your debt and it'll be good advertising for you. What do you say? I say. I say, yes, we're in business land. Heads up. No time for slacking from B to you has landed its first major order 50 gallons of honey by tomorrow. I want this place to be a hive of activity. It's your chance to show the world what sort of workers you are. Certainly buzzing with excitement. Or maybe they're hungry. Did you remember to feed them this morning from it? Liver, my blood. I'll do it. The whole not exactly a flood, is it? Flood waters grow. It's the weak link in our production chain. We need more flowers now. Where can I find a whole lot of flowers in a hurry? Beautiful morning, Mr. Wallace. I'm pleased to see you've emerged from your subterranean lair. I'm doing a spot of gardening. Have you miss Flint Working my green fingers to the bone? But the hard work appears to be paying off. Indeed, it does. Blooms everywhere. I call it my purple paradise. It certainly looks delicious. I mean, I imagine it would look delicious if you were an insect. You mean if I were a bee? Well, now you mention it. You want to feed my flowers to your bees. That is, if you don't mind. How many would you like? As many as you can spend. Well, you can have all you want, Mr. Wallace. Oh, much obliged, miss plate here. You can jolly well grow your own. Oh, right, oh. Then now with hard work and a little look, you should have a nice bed of flowers in two or three. It can't wait two or three months. I've got a deadline this evening. You pull a simple man. Nothing grows That quickly. Wonder Rex Armstrong's quick grow muscle formula. Watch them sprout in seconds. Hmm. If it works on people, perhaps I could adapt it to work on flowers. Three miracle ingredients grow ting and a giant strong girl. Well, I need a miracle and fast. There shouldn't be too tricky to knock up a batch myself. Then we'll see who's got the grandest garden in West Wallaby Street. The Hive will be humming in no time. You can't take an oath to up by Cloning made major. Come eat. If you don't mind any invasions, I beg your pardon. Did you get my message? Received intelligence of a major air assault? Expect the sirens to sound any minute. Hope you know where your nearest shelter is. If I do recall Something about that, but major crumb? Are you sure you're not mistaken? I know. I know I've made predictions before, but I'm not trying woof this time. I've got truth. Joe, it's what's Inside the job that counts incontrovertible evidence that the enemy is on the move, Does it? I can only see a snail. Of course it's a snail. But what's she trying to tell us? That's the important thing. What is she trying to tell us? What could happen? She's retreated into her shell in the middle of the day, and that means only one thing. It means she knows. Rubble is about to strike from the image, you know, of nature. Wallace lived in France during the war, never wronged yet. Oh, Weiss, I see you at least appreciate the seriousness of the situation. Now spread the word if people don't believe what an old soldier has to say, perhaps they're listening. Thomas Neal. Looks like can it really be She's beat his father's Wensleydale, your favorite? I'm going to take it that these are, yes, free samples. No, I Don't mind if I do Mr Barnier one for now and one for later. Oh, that is Miss Snipper 3000 banged up like a common criminal. Breaks my heart, that cheese detector is not a bad machine, just a bit over keen. It's all the energy needs in its system. Energize, it seems to me. Yes, energized is one of the ingredients in Rex Armstrong's quick grown muscle formula. I use my last energized battery to fuel the sniffer. I'll have to get it back if I want to finish the formula. Oops, miss. Morning Constable deboned. Got an early start today. Not planning anymore visits to the shops. You must be awfully hot under that helmet, I reckon. A sunny day like today, It's a trifle sweltering. Yes, well, it's danger and discomforts are all in the line of duty for an officer of the law, Though most folk don't appreciate it. I I noticed you received my petition for early release of the sniffer 3000 constable demands. Yes. And I notice it's attracted the signatures of just one man and his dog. We're only appealing for natural justice, But you have blinking chase detector thing. Give me what you call it, destroyed an entire grocery store. Teething problems. It's still only a prototype prototype. It's a felony. Yes, me a diabolical device. You can see that in its face. My machine isn't evil, Constable Gibbons. It's just got a short fuse and a few loose nuts who will Say, I'm going to formally interview this glorified cameos. And if it can convince me that it's not a menace to society, then perhaps I'll release it into your custody. You that prisoner Can only look at me when I'm talking to you. That's more like it. Now you've got time to think, what can you tell me about what happened yesterday? Feel bad about what you did, do you? He's waiting. Maybe these contraptions got feelings, after all. Now, I want the truthful answer. If I release you from custody, will you do it again? Well, I'll be darned. The prisoner has been interviewed. Yes, I'm Having exhibited signs of repentance. I am prepared to release into your protective custody provided Wallace. You give me an assurance that you'll keep your blink an eye on him or it or whatever he answers to. Oh, keep an eye on him, Constable Gibbons, you have my word on that. Phil Wallace, love host business. Could those be? I couldn't help but notice the flowers on your window ledge, Mrs. Gabelli. I love Lamp. Bring a touch of summer to the town square, especially the purple pansies. Always been partial to pansies me. You should see the flat. It's one of them blinking weeds if you ask me to buy them. Oh, going love and yet Monet. Oh, now look what you've done yet. Clumsy. Oh, I know what I'll get window when I'm yelling out you. Oh, right. Only to prove your insult. Don't get to me anymore. More do flexible. Is that so? Hey. What is it now? No amount. That, Jackie, you spotted Dodo. You do Know how to wound up Winning. He got about time. Serves him right for being such a grumpy old granddad. Do you mind if I? That is. Could you see your way fit to lending me that pot of pansies, Mrs. Galbally for business purposes, business purposes? Well, that'll be my guest. I've got bunches of them. I realize this may seem a trifle irregular, but Major Crum insisted, I show you this. It's oh, the smile in my garden. Have you lost your mind, Wallace? I'm not sure, To be honest. A nice cup of strong tea or the spark up the old gray matter May bring up back your Thieving rascal. Hold on a minute strongarm. That's one of the ingredients in Rex Armstrong's quick grow muscle formula. I need that tea bag. Here you are a little fella. Try some toast. Yes. Do you feed him? I'm sure the little man's hungry. What are you looking for exactly? Miss Flint, if you'll just take a look at the Panthers, I think you'll I Told you, Mr. Wallace, I refuse to let those yellow hooligans have the satisfaction of, Oh oh, you see them mending their ways. They're just needed a firm talking to, that's all. But the forgives, you are you not little Burns's sweet satisfaction, Mr Waltz. Yes, indeed. Very sweet. So that's where the dog tags went, I'm sure Gromit will be glad to get them back. Lawlis, thank heavens you made it to the shelter, I'd given you up for lost caught in the crossfire, were you? My work as a very devoted to their queen, I thought you might find this useful major crumb Ever made by George Wallace. There's nothing like a good helmet, makes a fellow want to put himself in the path of projectiles. If you know what I mean, you've got to get your mind off the carnage up there. Would you like to hear one of my old war stories? Help pass the time? Well, I hate to. Of course, you, lord. I brought visual aids. I still see. I found these in the whole major crime attacks, High Commission bound to happen. God can't leave good military material sitting on the shelf. I believe in that regard. Sounds like you were quite a soldier, major crumb. Well, why the past tense? Oh dear. Once a soldier, always a soldier, something you civilians will never last, and I'd be happy to prove it by charging into the fray that he is. If I had a set of dog tags and a regulation helmet, which I have had, I must. So George is a pretty boy. And yet beauty compels me to remain here. No one else to guard the protein bars around it. And so D.O.T. Gromit couldn't do the job. Private, it can I entrust my precious cache of protein bars to Tango? Perhaps he's proven himself a trusty foot soldier. If I am called away to the front, I'd feel comfortable leaving private Gromit in charge. Oh heavens, I shouldn't be skulking around in a cellar like a frightened rat. I'm a soldier under private bonnet. I hereby appoint you officer commanding this air raid shelter. I'm sure you'll pass out the rations. I've got a me. Request dispensation of protein bars, soldier. Now to mix up my very own quick grow muscle formula. That ought to do it. Oh, the Mix of mix all mixed up, go. Oh, thanks a lot. Checking to see if anything sprouted yet, Mr Wallace. Well, as a matter of fact, miss fled. Weirdly, I don't see what you're. Don't you think it would make Foot Road miracle? We're in Business now. We see from it, look, we're a bit of enterprise can get you. If I hadn't found that flyer, you chucked in the bin, I'd never have been able to concoct my miracle grow formula. And then where would we be? You really must be careful what you chuck. Hell no. Lincoln, nor oh, I would I think I'm going to faint. This ought to be plenty of fuel for the old pollinator. That's a beer that is 50 gallons of honey had just in time for my annual tea and crumpets festival. Pleasure doing business with you. Always aim to please our bees. That's the last of our bills grommet, and we've got just about enough left over for that little holiday we've been planning this year, I fancy. Black. Oh, yes, lad, I think our money troubles are over at last. Let's do This again. Excellent vantage point. Prepare for a crash landing. You get used. Sorry, Wallace, but I'm going to have to come to your dining room Now just a minute major crumb Time to argue, Oh man, the apartment. But here they come. And it chromate giant Beast. Heaven help the good citizens of Western Wall Street. Civilians out, but that's an order. Wallace Typekit Gromit kindly escort the civilian from the battle zone. Good heavens, grommet, you don't suppose those monsters have anything to do with our honey making operation, do you blend it? Well, a quick grow formula. It didn't just affect the flowers. Just hope it's a wrong number and not more bad news. Now, listen to me. Nice, doggy. I'm trapped in this tree by giant bees. Do you understand? You must take a message to your muster. I need him to get me down from here. Can you tell him that, Oh, wait a minute. Given this, it's no. Yes, Mr. Pannier. Well, of course, you're upset being dive bombed by giant bees isn't good for any business. We're doing all we can to get the situation under control. Normal honey service will be resumed as soon as possible with normal sized bees. That's a promise. It's a giant fly in the blood, and it's shaped like a bee. They're taking over the town. Time to read the Riot Act. I am their employer, after all. Oh, they won't listen. They're completely out of control. This funny business has a sting in the tail and no state, oh, do something for me. Hello from Peter. Constable Gibbons, Mr Gabala I hate what you going, at least you don't know. But I spoke out of turn yesterday. You're not down there, after all what I said?

Do know that they me to accompany the welcome to my, but I don't think how. I said, get out of there, they're knocking on, but I ain't finished yet.
