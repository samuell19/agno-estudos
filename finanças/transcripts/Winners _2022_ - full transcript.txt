In the name of God This film is dedicated to Abbas Kiarostami, Asghar Farhadi Majid Majidi and Ja'far Panahi Reza Naji Hossein Abedini Mahmood Jafari Parsa Maghami Helia Mohammadkhani Malalai Zikria Ezzatollah Ramezani Far And Special Guests Asghar Semsarzadeh Mir Taher Mazloomi You're making a movie, right? The man and the woman... Take a left, thanks. To Shahran. They were actors, right? You know how I figured it out? His last line was like in the coffee shop scene in "Crimson Gold", wasn't it? You, a cabbie? No way. Mr Panahi? - Yahya? No-one at your age is awake this late. Watching films every night. Sleep. - By God, it's not a bad film. - I don't care! Your eyes are popping out! Look at the clock. I'm just watching a film, Mother. What is the big deal? You watch films instead of eating or sleeping! Switch off the TV. Is watching films going to earn you any money? Okay, I'll sleep. I can't remember you! Midnight in Paris! Woody Allen! Oh, that's right! WINNERS Sure. Finally after the Trump situation, the statue has arrived. The Committee decided to keep it in the cinema museum. And I went this morning to collect it. I will personally hand over the parcel to the museum, don't worry. Will do, see you soon. Bye. You are coming from abroad? Let me play our music to wipe away all of the stress. You know you are my love... Could you stop the car? I need to get something, please? Lady, please come back fast. I'll be quick. Many thanks. I shouldn't stop here. Where did she go? The KIA driver! Move your vehicle! Move your car! - This is not the place to park! - I'm really sorry! Move on faster. Yes? There's a problem. I picked up a passenger. She left her parcel in my car. Mobile?! She doesn't have my number! It's not a mobile. It's some kind of statue. A man standing very politely. Like the statue in Horr Square. Like them but classy. My dear, people have always said: anything you find, you should put in the post-box. But this is too big for a post-box. When I pick you up at your mum's place, we'll give it to Garmsar post office. Okay, I'm coming. Actually, it was left in a car in Tehran last night. No, he didn't know its importance. It was the weekend and he didn't want to return it to Tehran. So he thought he'd bring it here. POST OFFICE COMPLAINTS BOX You're welcome. Where is my photo? Hi, can I see the photo? Here you go. Listen carefully... This is made from 92 percent tin, 7.5 percent copper... What is it? An important international trophy. Oh, yeah I've seen it on TV. You sure have. It's very famous. Is it? What is it doing here? It came here by mistake. We'll send it to Tehran on Saturday. - Let me pack it. - No, I'll tape it myself. When they moved to Sham Abdul Zubayr was already there in the year 672 AH or 673 AH, therefore the documentation of Yazid's murder is true. It was also very clear the cause of death was an overdose of alcohol. That is clear now about Yazid. What about the death of Ubayd Allah Ibn Ziyad who ordered the killing of Imam Hossein by Yazid? Well, Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad... It was the year 666 AH when he revolted against Imam Hossein in Karbala He was based in Iraq, in the city of Kufa... Hello. How are you my daughter? I was busy darling. You can't believe what I'm about to show you. An international statue! It came to Garmsar by mistake. The one our film director won, remember, the golden award? They showed him on TV the other day. I want to show it to the family. It has travelled all over the world. No harm in being our guest for a night too! Put on your glad rags. Take a photo with it. I'll put it back tomorrow. Don't worry. Nobody will find out. Give way! Let's get going. Congratulations. - What happened, Nasser Khan? - It broke down! It's your fault, you should go on a diet. Saber, hurry! What happened, Mr Nasser? Uncle Ezzat? Yes? Whose wedding is this? The groom is a stranger, but the bride is Shirali's daughter. They're taking the bride to the groom's house. Congratulations to them! But when will you get married? You're getting old. I'm always ready. Look! Move the car. Let me pass. Can't you see it's broken? Where are you going? - Home? - Where is your home? It's blocked! It will take time to fix this, take another path. - Oh no, among the bumps and holes? - Yes, that's right. You danced very well, cheeky. That was great. - Did you bring the DVD? - I said I must watch it first. But you watched it 100 times! You never get tired, even if you watch it 1000 times. "Cinema Paradiso". Whoever watches falls in love with it. You keep teasing me. Why would I? Let me watch it once more. You see every scene has a deep meaning. Each shot also has its own meaning. Then you can have it. It's a heavy film for you. You two! Come down from the top of the car. Hey, don't just sit there and chat. The dustcart will arrive soon. - Run, Yahya! - Run! What do you want from Saber? Your mother will be upset if she finds out. She told you not to talk to him. - Saber is a real jerk. - That's why you're so close to him? For a week now he was supposed to bring me a film. Another film? Don't be so friendly with him. He has all the films of the past 155 years. He has 1500 DVDs! Ah, so you get your films from him. Yes. What's wrong with that? Look, I hate him. Saber is my friend and he's a cool guy. Don't talk behind his back. - You said he was a jerk. - I will get my film in the end. Yahya, it's getting dark. Let's hurry. The dustcart will be arriving soon. The others will get there before us. You're right, let's go. Wait for me. Turn your back. Leila, don't look at me. Sure... Yahya? - Look - What is it? I don't know. - What is that? - Dunno. Let me see. Looks like a doll. This is not a doll. Isn't it gold, Leila? No, I think it's brass. It must be valuable. Let's go. Fill your bags before the council officers come. Anyone finished, just move on. Well done! What was that? Nothing - I'm asking again, what was that? - None of your business! Hey, metals are his, you know that! I brought it from home. - Let me see it. - It's a doll. It was metallic and shiny. Piss off! - You found it here, liar! - I'm not a liar! - Back off! - I did not find it here! I tripped her. You okay? Nothing happened to you? I'm fine. Why did you get involved? You'd be dead if he punched you once! Is the statue safe? They didn't get it? Never! It's here. I'm fast as a hawk! I guess it's valuable. It looks like the figures on the front of lorries. Saber has one, it looks like a dog. He took the dog statue from the damaged lorry. Let's take ours to Garmsar town and show it to Mahmood's uncle. He deals in antiques. He may pay a good sum for it. Strangers will cheat us. Let's hand in the plastics first. Okay. - Can you walk? - Yes. Give me your bag. You can keep the statue. Put it under your jacket, where no-one can see. Just wait! Give it to me? What's the matter with you? Don't you see he's naked? That's more like it. He's respectable now. What are you doing? Line up! One at a time and be quiet! Make a line! Don't make so much noise! Stay in the queue. You've become a bully! Don't be noisy. Jabbar! Why is a weight missing? Can't you remember? You put them back yourself. - Yahya! - Yes? Come here. Bring the weights. Sure. Faster. You keep weighing yourself. - What did you steal? - What do you mean? - The golden vase, the one you stole! - Watch your language! You are the thief. - Have you found the weight? - Yes, I'm coming. Let's go. One at a time! Back off! - What's going on here? - Hi Mr Naser. Why all this noise? - 25.7 - 25! - He said 25.7 - Go if you don't like it. There's a kilo of dirt on them! They're not pure. - Take it or leave it! - Okay, no problem. - 23.7 - 23! Next! Weigh this. - 25.6 - 25! - But he said 25.6 - Don't haggle. - Did you all get your money? - Yes! - Thank God for that! - Thank God! Empty your bags and leave. Leila, you go. - Don't be late. - Sure. Did you watch the film I gave you? Did you bring it? I watched it but didn't bring it. I'm going to town. Good for you! Hope it's nothing bad. I have something to do. No problem. Don't go without a film. Here, watch this. - What is it? - "Chokolate". Chocolate? Yes, chocolate with extra cream on top! No, fool! The film is called "Chokolate". A famous French actress is in it. "Beenosh" Juliet. She was in an Iranian director's film too. He is very international. The whole world knows him. - He's really Iranian? - Of course! - Don't you know? - You never told me. Anyway, watch it till. "Cinema Paradiso". I give you. - When? - Pack it in! - Tell me when! - Go! I will give it later. What a beauty! Where did you get it from? I could make one easily. What a body he has! It's shiny. I could make one from dough. Hello. Where did you get it? We found it in the rubbish. - I am Mahmood's friend. - Mahmood? Your nephew. Oh, our Mahmood! That's right. I'm at your service. How much is it worth? It's a collector's piece. Good for those who collect such things. It isn't worth much. - How much will you pay for it? - It's no use to me. - You won't buy it? - I don't have a customer for it. I cannot resell it. Nobody wants such things. - They could smelt it. - Possibly. Isn't there gold on it? Because you're Mahmood's friends, I'll pay a base metal price. - How much is this doll? - You want to buy it? 5000. These fish are pretty. Follow me, I filled the pond with water. Wait a moment? Why this pond? Isn't it a pity to have a nice pond here... and not have fish in the water? I did it for you. Really? Good job we didn't sell it! He was trying to cheat us. He was a real chancer. He thought we were kids. It's beautiful. - Let me wash it. - Why? What happened? I need to wash it... You might drop it. - Give it here. - It's still wet. I'll dry it. No, I'll do it myself. Can I have it now? Is it good now? Where are the fish? The golden one just passed my foot. It just touched my feet. Hello my darling. You look happy today? Yes. Is there any food? Before you take off your shoes... Take this kilim to the customer. Okay, I will do it later. It's urgent. Don't make excuses. Can't he pick it up himself? No, make sure you don't lose the money. This is annoying. By God, I am really ashamed. You made a bad mistake. You disgraced us. You ruined your work record of 28 years for nothing. I didn't want it to happen. It's a breach of trust. I'll find it. I promise I will. Tell me what happened. All of it! It was still in the bag when I got here. Was it wrapped up? Yes, I mean no! They were taking the bride when I got here. And then the road got blocked. They danced and got presents. Their song became the song of my hard luck! I had to wait a while, then I took the farm path. You can clearly see the bike marks on the road. I was looking after the statue all the time. Where do you think it fell? Maybe here, there, behind the hill, in front of the hill, I don't know! I don't want to upset you, but your charge is theft. My God! Theft? Oh my god. We should have found it, if it was here. Find it before it's too late. We don't have time. I'll find it! Goodbye. Where can it be? What do you want? Look who's here! Yahya the Hawk! Who do you think you are? What do you want? What did you do with it? You sold it? Yes, I did. - You wanted to spend the money on her? - Don't drag her into this, jerk! You're offended now? I will take you down. You wish. Hurry Jabbar. It may rain. I'm tired. "Tired!" You've worked only a little. Saber! Look who's here! Mr Yahya! Hello. Hello, brother. Welcome! You should've told me you were coming, I would've organised a party for you! - Why are you upset? - I got into a fight. Who with? Give me his photo and I will deliver his dead body in a flash! It doesn't matter. Is Nasser Khan in? - No, let's go inside. - No, thanks. Will you give me the film? - "Cinema Paradiso"? - Yes, please. You're so lucky, I brought it today. Let's go in. - Would you like tea? - No thanks. Sit here so you don't get dirt on the bed. Sure. Don't touch it! Careful. You'll scratch it! Okay, I will not. Give it back. Don't be nosey. No, no! It's... It's what? How can I put it? Not good for your age. Where is it? - Ah... it's in the player of course. - Should have thought of it earlier. You're sleeping in front of the TV again? Mother, I got this film today. I must watch it. It's a very good movie. I'll go to sleep quickly once I've watched it. What's different with this rubbish? You'll go blind. This one's different. These movies are changing you. Now you go and fight in the streets. [The Song Of Sparrows] You are a grown up. You must find a better path for yourself. Soon I won't be able to look after you. You are a man now. If you don't listen, I'll send you to work cleaning tractors. I'll tell Nasser Khan not to buy plastics from you. What's it got to do with Nasser Khan? He is no-one to me! We should be grateful to him. - Go to sleep now. - Okay, I will! You always pick on me. I'll burn your rubbish and myself to be rid of you! Did you give any thought to all the bacteria and trash in the water? Mr Karim, they said if we throw fish in here... they'll be worth double in a month. Fish can't survive in the sludge. Oh! He's so like Nasser Khan! Instead of cleaning, you need to drain it... so we can find the hearing aid. It's him. It's definitely Nasser Khan! Snake! Snake! The dustcart is coming back. Let's go! Wake up. Let's move on. Who's first? 10.2. Next! 11.3. 11! - 15.2. - 15! 18.7. 18! -11.2. -11! 15.8. Next! 15! - But it's 15.8! - Go somewhere else if you don't like it. - It's only 200 grams short of 16 kilos. - Go where they count it that way. - What choice do I have? - How do I know? Here, this is for 15. 27.9. - Why are you staring at me? - Nothing, sir. - 15.8? - Okay. Here you go for 15 - 11.5. - Here for 11. - How much was it again? - 11.5. Okay. Here you go too. Put it here boy! Focus. - 25.8. - 25. - Is that not enough for you too? - Doesn't matter. It doesn't? I'll pay you less then. What's the matter with you today? 11.2. Saber! Pay them, I'll come back. You, come with me! Where did you get it from? Come with me. - Get in! - What have I done? Take your shoes off. Get in. Go in there! - I bought it from the shop. - The shop was wrong to sell it! Is that you, Nasser Khan? Nasser is dead! Nasser is ruined! He is poor. It is you, isn't it? Listen to me boy. Let me live my life as now. I had a different life, a different job before, in Tabriz. I loved cinema and theatre. One day I got a role in the cinema, from a very famous director. I had no idea I'd become so famous so quickly. I got awards from all over the world. Everybody expected too much from me. People expected more money from Mr Winner! Every time I wanted to buy something I couldn't even haggle. I couldn't even sell anything. "You're famous, they'd say now, don't be stingy!" They think actors are made of money. I never even got paid for acting in the movie! My life started to go to ruin. I was under so much pressure. I lost my job. The pressure of fame was hard to cope with. I had to disappear. My family didn't want to leave our hometown, even my wife never wanted to move from her birth place. I had to take the hard decision to come here alone. Don't tell anyone who I really am. Let me live here in peace. Here no-one knows me. Promise to keep it to yourself. Swear on your mother... Don't tell anyone who I am. I'm Nasser and that's it, okay? - Deal? - Yes We'll go out now and weigh your bag. No word to anyone. Okay? Good boy. Come with me now. Why are you fighting? Play nicely. Be kind! - He pokes his nose into my business! - Make up now, tell each other jokes. Come with me. Why didn't you pay them? You have the money. - Let's weigh again. - Sure. Yahya! Bring yours. - 25.8. - Here is 26 for you. Put it here. - 15.3. - We're together. Here you go... 16. 8.8. Next please. - Why did you give them more? - Don't complain! Take yours. - What did you tell him? - Nothing! - You sure it's him? - Yes. He told me everything but made me promise not to tell anybody. Then why is he living like this? He doesn't like the life of famous people. He wants to live for himself, to have a job. He doesn't play in films anymore? He loves cinema and sometimes takes little parts. I think when Saber says he's gone to another town, he could be acting. Maybe. Imagine if I became an actor one day. You made a mess. Wait Reza? Let me tell you something. Tell me what? You've ruined everything. I didn't say anything about you. The boy worked it out. Just like that? Who gave him the DVD? I didn't. He took it. Even worse! Anybody can enter and take anything here. You're like a scarecrow who doesn't scare! I promise I didn't give it to him. You ruined everything! Why are you blaming me? Please forgive me! You've turned this place into a video club. We can't work together. I told you many times not to keep our own films here. Are you satisfied now? We must live like tramps again. Okay! Go! He doesn't believe me and blames me for everything. He thinks he is the only one who acted in films. I'm getting rid of everything, even all of the DVD's. Look here! Is that what you wanted? Am I your problem? They're worth nothing to me! Take them! Destroy them if you want. I also ran away from myself. 24 hours cameras watching me too. I miss the days when I was myself, before I was an actor. I worked in the fruit market and lived my simple life. Whatever I wore was my own business! Nobody looked at me, how I arranged my hair. Sometimes I wish I'd never met any directors. And never won that worthless glass trophy! "Reza Naji!" "I dedicate this award to my people and Iranian cinema." Time passes and the seasons pass and our life it also changes. It's a beautiful song. But I will not forget you, believe me. My beautiful friend, do not forget me! Remember the sweet memories of our past. Do not forget me. Don't give in to gloomy thoughts. I have good memories here. It's hard to leave. Yahya is a good son. He isn't a tell-tale. - Yes, he is a good boy. - Then why are you worried? I'm not. I'm just tired. I wouldn't have let him watch that film if I knew. Don't say that! It isn't his fault. It is my fault. I'll tell Yahya not to tell anybody. That's why I'm here. I must work out what to do next. I'm fed up with him watching films all night... when he has to go to school in the morning. He talks about some ornament he found the other day. It's become his life. An ornament? He found it in the rubbish. And he was beaten up for it. It's already hard for me to raise a son by myself. If only his father was alive. My son is all I have in this foreign land. We are Afghans. I have nobody to support us. God bless you for giving my child a job. Help him! You can be his guardian. Trust in God. Don't you worry. Thank you. Bye for now. Thank you too. Hello, Mr Nasser. Hello, my dearest Yahya. What did he want in here? He came to say hello. Hello. He suddenly came to say hello? Don't be bossy. He wanted to talk about you. Yahya? God doesn't like us to reveal our secrets. Remember never ever breach the trust of others. Give me two days and I'll find it. I'm sure I will. God! What did I do to myself? The good people of Padeh Village! Attention please! We've copied this photo to be posted on the walls. This statue is missing. Look well in your farms, by the river. It's shiny metal. Easy to spot. Go away! It's candid camera! Let's look for the camera. Somebody's probably buried it to take it out later. There is a lot of gold in it. Allow me. I work in Garmsar Post Office. This parcel came to us by mistake a few days ago. A colleague made a mistake and lost it here in your village. This trophy is very important. It belongs to our greatest artist. Very few artists in our country have achieved such an award. Look! - He looks like Nasser Khan! - It's him, isn't it? What are you talking about? He has much more hair than Nasser Khan. No, he looks nothing like him. He must stay in the station until the statue is found. Who is that? What happened? What have you done again? Yahya! Where are you going? Wait, I need to speak with you. Oh God, please take my life and I will be released from this boy. - You okay? - Yes. Something's wrong? What is an international statue doing here? In Padeh village, with us? - Leila? - Yes. What would you do if they arrest me? You'll be alone. Why would they arrest you? We'll give it to them. We didn't steal it. We found it. My mother will grieve to death by the time I prove I didn't steal it. - What are you going to do? - I'll deliver it to the owner myself. - How will you find him? - Nasser Khan will have his address. Wait! Yahya? What's wrong Nasser Khan? I'm tired, I can't take it anymore. I miss the old me. Have you forgotten so much trouble? What trouble? It was Love. We should not be ungrateful. Come. Where did you find it? - That's his house. - Over here. Hello madam. We have been given information your son has the statue. Is your son home? Leila? Come, my dear. Come here. Eyes off! Saber, time to go. Something happened? I need to go. Have I upset you? I'm not upset. I've had some advice. I need to sort out my life. Here you go. This is your share. And this is mine. Forgive me. I need to go. Look after yourself. Mr Reza, don't go! - Yahya, I'll give you a lift. - Sure. Uncle Reza wait, I'm coming too! - Saber, sing for us. - Sure. I like a special flower in the meadow. Dear Friend, remember me next spring... ...when you are on top of the. mountain, do not forget me. - Can I open this, Uncle Reza? - Go ahead, son. Oh! What is it? It's the Silver Bear of Berlin! "The Song of Sparrows". Mr Reza won this for in competition with strong international actors... beating Daniel Day-Lewis, Eric "Banana" and Ben Kingsley. In the end, he beat them all! Hi, Mr Reza Actor! Mr Reza, I think you are exposed! Hello, Mr Reza! And what is this one? - Why is he wearing that dress? - Take it off. It's so Leila won't see him naked. Leila isn't here now. - You don't know what it is? - No. They call it Oscar. Many people dream of winning it. It raises up some who win it.. but destroys others. Two international trophies! All actors dream of winning one of these. Yahya, over here. Yahya, take this money. You'll need it in Tehran. No thank you. I have money. Take it! When you get off the train in Tehran... take a taxi and tell the driver to take you to Milad Tower. There is a programme there this afternoon. If they don't let you in, give me a call. Okay. Saber, I didn't think this would happen by watching a DVD. No problem. Take care in Tehran. I didn't tell anybody about you. Only Leila. - No problem my boy, go now. - Bye for now. - Will you take me to Milad Tower? - Yes. Get in. How far is it? About 30 minutes. How much must I pay? Usually a lot. I'll walk instead if it is a lot. Don't worry son, I'll take whatever's in your pocket. - Where are you from? - Padeh Village in Garmsar. Sorry to ask but what brings you to Tehran? I have something important to do. Hello! What are you doing here? It's a job too. One must live. We should work to survive. - You came to work in this city? - No. Do your relatives work in there? No. There is a famous person I'm looking for. Famous? Interesting. He's a cinema director. You don't know him. He won the biggest award in the world. It sounds very serious. So you are after the cinema's famous man! Interesting! What is interesting? - Because I love cinema too. - You do?! Yes. Is he your relative? Or are you just a fan? I'm a fan. I love his films. You know him? And you want to play in his films? I must give him an important belonging. An important belonging? Why have you stopped? - What a crazy driver! - I'm so sorry. I've never seen you this quiet before? What's the matter? It's the film festival season. I miss the feeling. Why have you stopped? I haven't seen this statue with a dress before! Is it not proper to deliver it like this? I'm sure he would love it. Deliver it like this. It's interesting that you know the owner well. I love his films. I know all directors! All of them? Do you know Jafar Panahi too? I do. My friend Saber gave me his film "Taxi" and I watched it. - I never thought! - He had a camera on his dashboard too. - And he looks a bit like you. - Are you sure? When I won this award... I dedicated it to the Iranian nation on TV. I'll take it to the Cinema Museum. It belongs to the people. Hello my friend. How are you? I know. But they won't let me in. I have a surprise for you. I'm bringing someone there. He has something for you. We'll be there soon. Okay, bye. It was him?! Yes. You don't believe that? You are in the cinema too? That depends what you call "in the cinema". I don't understand you. Thank you. Goodbye. Go, son. Tell him Jafar said hello. Sound? Camera? Action! I take my instrument hanged from the wall... and place it on my chest. When you are asleep, how can I play the instrument for you, to show you I am arriving? I am worried Uncle Reza. Could we at least change our trashy clothes? Let's put on some chic clothes first. Saber dear, people will just think we are coming from set in our costumes. Don't worry about it. Uncle Reza? Jafar Panahi? Isn't that him in the taxi? Where is he? For sure, it's him. He's a very unique filmmaker. I always enjoy watching his films. Every time he makes a film, there is a buzz internationally. Cinema is in his blood. Saber, dear, like you cannot separate a child from its mother. Agreed. Oh my god! Look who's here? Can I take a picture with you? With pleasure. Thank you. You can also see Mr Reza Naji! I really like you! - A picture please? - Yes sure...
