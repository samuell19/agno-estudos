You be careful now, poke. With your help, we're gonna make this barbecue and rally, the biggest thing that's happened in this part of the state. And I just know it's gonna go a long way to gettin' Jesus Mendez over the top for that congressional seat in Washington. Now Jimmy, what about those campaign placards, and the bumper stickers, and all that stuff? Is that taken care of? Placards are all ready sir. We got the sticks being cut now. All the kids are just standing by waitin', to stick one of these on every bumper in the country. Hello, mister Duke. How you doin', Ellis? Everybody's in the living room. I'm late. And all the beer that all the men can drink. I think it'll do. Mornin' Duke, mornin', mornin'. I'm sorry I'm late but I was over at the grounds going over with some extra security people, just to make sure they understand their positions for today. Mm-hm, there's your man. Stick with him. He's your personal responsibility. Well, just about the only other thing I got to say is, if they don't pick up on Jesus, maybe they'll go along with Jesus. This place has got everything poke, booze, broads, and barbecue. Looks like everybody's here. Listen now, we should go over there and get some free beer, and sorta get, you know, sorta get wound up. No thanks, boogie. I got a friend I gotta go see first. Whatever you say. All right now, everybody listen. The one who catches the pig, gets the gobbler. Cooter, you ready? Yo buddy, if you're waitin' on me, you're backin' up. Well then let her go! You got it, you got the Turkey. No, don't tie it, I'll just take it like that. Okay. Be a quarter. Thank you very much. Well good afternoon, mister sheriff calley. Poke, why don't you get the hell out of here? Oh come on now, that ain't friendly, Duke. I'm gonna have to apologize for Duke here, he forgets his manners sometimes. I'm telling you, get your ass out of here. Duke, you're just full of talk. His bark's worse than his bite. The truth is, Duke here he don't bite, he's just a little pecker. You know, like a chicken. Like a chicken, Duke. Duke here's a chicken who thinks he's a rooster. Excuse me ma'am. Poke, I oughta bust your head open, but I'm not, because it's such a nice day, and bein' as I'm in such a good mood, but I just want to remind you about that bus. I don't want to see the sun risin' on your ass, boy. You know what I mean? I don't want to see the sun rise on your ass, you know what I mean? How are you? Well you look great, it's nice to see you here, and the first think I want to know is, are you gettin' enough to eat? Yeah! Well that's fine, that's fine. Now, I wanted to interrupt you just long enough to say, to introduce you to the man that's responsible for bringing us all here together. Come on. Here, come on, try again. Hi, here. Go ahead, play it. Sure do grow up fast, don't they? Yeah, that's just what I was thinkin'. Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me a great deal of pleasure, to introduce our next United States congressman, Jesus Mendez. Thank you, thank you. My dear friends, how long ago, it seems. You know, in a year that boy's gonna be runnin' right over the top of his mama. He's gonna be needin' a daddy full-time. You been thinkin' about last night? Yeah. Yes, I have. It's been so long, I almost forgot how good it was. Yeah. How about California, huh? You're stupid. And ain't nothin'. Ain't nothin' here. Mary Lee, I think it's about time we get somethin' to eat. Mama. You heard me, now come on! Okay. Bye Kevin. And so my friends, I leave here today with open arms, and with open eyes. And when I am elected, my door will be to you forever open. You know, that sure was a heap of speech-makin' mister Mendez. - Thank you, thank you. Sure been some wingding, ain't it? Yes indeed. You know, I tell you, I think you're gonna make it. That's fine, that's fine. It really did go well, I think the same thing's gonna happen over in new braunfels. What time's that rally over there? Three o'clock. Three o'clock. Sheriff, you take him on over there. I'll see you guys in about 30 minutes, okay? Where's my briefcase? Oh damn, I forgot it. I'l go back and get it. Go with him Lenny. He don't need me, Duke. Go with him, Lenny. All right, hold it. Stay back, stay back, there's nothing to see. Oh Jesus god. What happened here? Son of a bitch opened up on him, he didn't stand a chance. Well don't just stand there, get an ambulance. He don't need no ambulance. He's dead. Well this sure as hell doesn't say much for your security. You just don't know who you're hiring these days. My god, what's this country comin' to? God damn it. Nobody could have seen a god damn thing 'cause... Son of a bitch! Lenny, come in. Yeah, Duke. I want you to pick up poke Jackson. What's the charge? Same damn thing, possession. Poke, you gonna tell me why we're in such a god damn hurry to get this car together? I mean you've been actin' crazy ever since... Listen up boogie. Now Duke didn't just shoot that boy, oh no, not Duke. What do you mean? I know nobody thinks Duke is any kind of hero. No no, that ain't what I mean. I mean he killed him, he murdered him. Cold blood. Somehow those two boys was in it together. What kind of shit you tryin' to hand me? I ain't handin' you no shit, 'cause I saw it. Duke no sooner plugged that boy, then he took something off him, 'cause he knew it was there! Jesus, what was it? It was this. 25,000 dollars. Jesus h Christ. Jesus, what are you gonna do with it? I'm gonna buy this car, gonna go get Mary Lee, I'm gonna get my boy, and I'm gonna get out of here. How was it? About 11.6. Hell, I can do better than that. Howdy sheriff. What brings you out here? Got anything new on that Mendez killing? Well, we ain't got no new leads, looks like he was working by himself. You bring that money with you? Well not exactly. Not exactly? What's that mean, not exactly? What's that mean? Well, he didn't have it on him. You wouldn't bullshit old cj, would you Duke? No sir, I ain't bullshittin' you. He must have left it somewhere. I gave you 25,000 dollars, and I'm gonna hold your ass responsible for it. You understand? Yes sir. I want to find it just as bad as you do. Well, I'll be in touch. Buster, put another'n in the chute. Yeah Lenny, what is it? Hey Duke, I'm at boogie's. I think we got poke. All right Lenny, I'm on my way. Yes sir, chief. Boogie? Is it Duke? It's Lenny. Why don't you go out and just talk to him? Just be real nice. Go on, go out and talk to him. Hey Lenny, what you doin' around here? Nothin' much. What's you doin', boogie? Well you see, I got me a lady inside and... Lady? Yeah. Your radio making her a little nervous, you know what I mean? She thinks the place is gonna be raided. She must be a pretty kinky lady. Why? Well do you usually make out with a wrench in your hand? Huh? What do you think, I'm dumb boy? What's poke's motorbike doing over there? Hell, that's been here ever since poke left, you know that, Lenny. Well I don't know that, boy. Where's poke, inside? No, no. - Where is he? I ain't seen him since this afternoon at the picnic, Lenny. I'll kill you, boogie. Chase their butts off. Duke, poke got away but I'm on his tail. All right Lenny, you stay on his butt. Yeah Duke. All right junior, I want you to set up a roadblock on black bull Avenue. You got that? All right Duke, I'm on my way, 10-4. Emergency unit come in, come in. Damn. Shit! Shut up! Who's out there? Me, poke. Get back! Dumb son of a bitch. Poke Jackson, I might have known it was you. Come on in, boy. What the hell you doin' out here? I need your help, cleotus. Poke, you're always gettin' in some kind of trouble. Hey man, Duke's just out to bust my ass. And it ain't just the same old shit. Cleotus, I gotta get out of here. Hey, I want to take Mary Lee and my boy with me. And Duke's watchin' 'em. I don't know. I just don't know. There ain't nobody else I can ask. Cleotus, you gotta help me. Ah, come on poke. You know what you askin' me to do, boy? You askin' me to get my ass shot off. There ain't nobody else. All right, suppose I do want to help you. How you figure on gettin' in there and gettin' them out? I don't know, but I ain't leavin' here without Mary Lee and my boy. Mama? That you? Hey Duke. How you doin' Mary Lee? Okay. You seen, seen old poke Jackson? No, I ain't, why? Oh nothin'. Because of him, two of my deputies were killed. Wife, kids, both like that. I just thought maybe you might have seen him, since I seen some motorcycle tracks out there. I don't know nobody else ridin' a motorcycle, do you? Huh? I don't know what you're talkin' about. You don't, huh? No I don't. Well when's the last time you seen poke? At the barbecue. At the barbecue? That's cute, that's real cute. I'm gonna say this, and I'm just gonna say it one damn time. Now tomorrow morning they're gonna be burying a man. There's gonna be some kids there watchin' him go down in the ground. And you know what that means? Hmm? I told you. I don't know. You think I'm playin' with you? No! No, I told you I don't know. Get outta here. I'm gonna give you a little piece of advice. Don't you be caught with him. You think this is just another chickenshit arrest, boy? Huh? See that? See what that says? That's a warrant for poke Jackson's arrest. Murder one, and that makes you an accessory after the fact, boy. Hey, you even hit the big time, boogie. But, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna fix those front headlights, and I'm gonna fix that dent, and I'm gonna let you go home, have a nice big old bowl of black-eyed peas, and some hot cornbread with your mama. Huh? Where's poke? I don't know Duke. Hey boogie, you remember them times you and me played pool? Huh? And then went out and got drunk together? Why I even let him come through town a couple of times in this car, and I didn't stop him one time, now did I Lenny? Never did. That's right, and you know something? Things have changed since old poke Jackson got back into town. That right, boogie? Now, where's poke? I don't know, Duke. I told you! Duke! Duke! Don't hit me! Boy, you know I don't like losin' my temper, because when I do I get indigestion, and that makes me very angry. All right, he ain't gonna talk. So I'm gonna take him downtown. Now you stay here, and if poke shows up, you call me right away. I'm gonna send junior back here in about 20 minutes, okay? Come on. Damn boy, get along with. Come on, boogie. Straighten up, here. There you go. Come on. Come on, boogie. Get in there. What? Somebody at the door. - Huh? There's somebody at the door. Boogie, lord god almighty. Boogie? Come on, let's get him inside. Jesus! Yeah, what happened? All busted up inside. Old man calley, beat me ass not more than half a mile from here. He didn't know it, and I didn't say nothin'. Poke, You don't have to pay me nothin' for that car, poke. I want you to have it. I want you to have that car. He's dead, cleotus. Duke killed him. I'm gonna kill that son of a butch. God damn, I'm gonna have to kill that man. Cleotus, I'm gonna kill that man right now. Hey, now you hold on. You get outta my way! Now get outta my way! Hold it, hold it right there. What about your son? Here you go, hon. Now don't touch it now, 'cause it's hot. There you are. What you fellas doing out here? Never mind what I'm doing out here, what the hell you doin' out here? Well I saw missus Carter in town, and she told me she had some good old junk just layin' around. Yeah, well get the damn junk and get out. We're on a stake out, you know. Who you lookin' for? Poke Jackson. Lord have mercy, that boy in trouble again? All right now, come on, get out of here, get out. Eat. Cleotus, what the hell do you do with all that junk? Well, I kind of make something out of it. What the hell could you make out of that? Well you have use your imagination, you know. Might be able to make a Swiss watch outta this. You can't make no Swiss watch outta that. You ever tried it? You don't know then, do you? You sure don't. How about a pinkie ring for the jolly green giant? Now I'm curious, now I want to know what you gonna do with that stuff? Well, I thought I'd sell it. That? Yeah. For how much? Oh I get about 10 cents a pound's worth. So what happens if you come up with say, six, seven thousand pounds of that stuff? Well, I'd buy me a jug and just forget about the rest of the week. Tell me, what did poke do? Murder. Murder? Dead. Aw, come on. Poke? Are you crazy? Lenny and junior are out there. What are you doing? You and me and Kevin, we're gonna get in that truck, and we're gonna go to California. Hear that Kevin, we're gonna take you to California. Oh no, you killed someone. Poke, they told me you killed someone. Baby I didn't kill nobody, I wouldn't kill nobody. Well how come Duke calley's looking for you? He even came here looking for you. 25,000 dollars. Duke calley took this off the man he killed at the picnic, and then he hid it. Oh Mary Lee, Duke calley was in on the killing. He set that Mendez up. Mary Lee I saw him do it, and that's why Duke calley wants to kill me. But I came back for you Mary Lee. I came back for you too, partner. I want you to come to California with me, Mary Lee, 'cause I love you. I love you too. So come on. Let's get goin'. Come on. Okay.

Now I want you to stay down, stay low, get on the floor. All right? I'm a son of a bitch. That's a transmission for a '62 Ford pickup. That ain't no Ford, mister junior. Honest. That's a dodge. Cleotus, I know a '62 Ford transmission when I see one. Well it looks like a dodge to me. Well how much you want for it? Uh, 10 dollars. Who is it? Looks like poke Jackson. Son of a bitch stole my car. Junior, we are in trouble. Step on it. Wait, you're in trouble. He didn't steal my car! Just step on it! Where's Kevin? Junior? Lenny? If Mary Lee and Kevin don't come out of there, get your ass in the water. Where is he? Where is he? I got ya, it's okay. Oh Jesus. No Kevin. Kevinl Feel better son? Lenny, let me have a cigarette. Everything's gonna be all right. Yeah, that's another thing we'll get this old boy for. Kidnappin'. He did kidnap you didn't he? No, I went with him. Then you're a damn fool, you could have got yourself and the kid killed. Let's talk about killin', huh? Hey Lenny, Duke ever tell you about what a big man he is? Did you know that he murdered that guy who killed Mendez? Just outright murdered. Hush up will ya? Peckerhead, he was shot trying to get away. Oh Lenny, he's always feedin' you the hind ass of everything. He murdered that guy. Shut up! Only Duke messed up this time, because I saw it. Ain't that right, Duke? What the hell's he talkin' about, Duke? Lenny. Lenny, why don't you ask Duke about the 25,000 dollars he took off him after he killed him? Hush your mouth, please. He hid it, only I got there first. That's right, Lenny. Listen, you shut up huh, just shut up. I've got the 25,000 dollars. Shut up! Who you workin' for, Duke? Huh? Who'd want Mendez dead? Who'd pay you 25,000 dollars to do that, Duke? You stay here. Where you takin' him? Shut up! He's gonna get what he deserves. Where's he takin' him? You stay back! He's tellin' the truth Lenny. He's tellin' the truth, Duke'll kill him! Where's the money? Look for it. You know somethin' poke? You always did have a big mouth. You know somethin' else? Always didn't know how to shut it.
