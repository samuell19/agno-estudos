(eerie electronic piano music) (metal clanking) (scanner beeps) (man calls in foreign language) - Don't move. (metal creaking) Well that leg looks pretty bad. (tense music) I gotta go. (peaceful music) - Wade, what are you doing? Where's Mandroid? - Mandroid is here. - Well this is certainly keeping out of sight. - Zanna, I just saved some guy's life. - Wade, if a security patrol came along and saw you-- - Security patrol can't do a damn thing to us. - Except throw us in prison, execute us for no reason, torture us. - All right. Fine. - Hey. Hey. I'd rather have you alive than dead. That's all. (adventurous orchestral music) (laughs) - Tell me, tell me, Carolyn. - Why? Are you interested? - Just curious. - Curiosity killed the cat. (laughs) - Okay. Don't tell me. (sneaky music) - You know what to do. - (grunts) Yes. - Hurry! - He used the old line about being an American lost here and would I show him the city. - Did you? - Sure. Just enough. - And? - And what? - Did you fall in love with him? - Right now, I'd drop to the floor for any man who would take me who would take me to the US. - Any man? - Yes. (Alexa laughs) Any old pig would do it. (laughs) (man grunting) (men chuckling) (car engine running) - Ah! Let's push it down! (men grunt and groan) (car screeches) (women scream) (screaming) (men taunting) (screaming) (door creaks) (creepy music) - Please. Don't hurt me. - I will not hurt you. I just... want you to be nice to me. I want you to dance for me. - Hm. (chuckles) Looks like somebody's been stockpiling young women. Ooh la la. - You think that's funny? - Hey, take it easy, alright? - Those girls might be dead right now. - Wade, it was a joke. - Just do your job. Let's get Mandroid fired up. - Don't be angry at Ryder. We're all under a lot of pressure. Ben gets out of the hospital tomorrow and we're running out of time. - You got all the time in the world with me. I'm not going anywhere. - Well, I didn't say that. - Oh, what the hell. I'm either in the chair or in the tin can. Let's get this show on the road. (beeps) (dark music) - Ready to rock and roll? - [Mandroid] Captain Radiation strikes again. - Time, Zanna? - 10 seconds. Record it all. (electric buzzing) (explosion) - [Wade] Zanna, turn off the unit. (alarm beeping) - Don't panic. Cut the power manually, Wade. - What the hell's that supposed to mean? - Break the cone, if we hit the red we're gonna fry half the country with this. - [Wade] We might want to run a check on Mandroid's delicate touch. (mysterious music) (snoring) - My God. - [Zanna] Yuck. Some leftovers. - Here, catch. You start on the salad, I'll improvise the rest. - Ooh, I didn't know you were a chef too. - Just an asshole, right? - You know, I have this stupid idea that one day I'm gonna pump the Supercon in me and I'm gonna stand up and walk away from this chair and... (sighs) I'm trying, Zanna. - I know. Am I too heavy? - I couldn't even feel it even if you were. - Well. - I can feel that. - That's good. (thunder crashes) (dramatic music) (groans) (rain falling) (thunder crashing) (door creaks open) - You'll look good in this. (giggling) - Now Philip, drink this. Don't you want these scars to disappear? I can make them go away. Now, drink this. Please. Now! New tissue should grow almost immediately. (groaning) (chuckles) Take him with the other failures. (door creaks open) (gasping) (men jeering) - Do whatever he says, whatever it is. - What? - [Prisoner] Do it! - Or he'll give you to those crazy bastards. - What crazy bastards? (spits) (frantic music) (cheering) (yells) - And what are you going to do for us tonight? - I don't understand. - Dance for us. - Bam bam. Bam bam. (claps) Bam bam. Bam bam. Bam bam. Bam bam. (exotic music) (men clapping) - She's all yours, boys. (men groaning) (screaming) - Oh Ben, this is our new assistant, Ryder. - Mr. Knight, this is quite an honor. - Don't be too sure about that. I've got quirks. - Excuse me? - Zanna didn't tell you. - Never mind. Let's go. (mysterious music) (computers beeping) - Hey Ben. Is that you under there? - Glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor. - Gotta have it. - It's good to be home. - It's very good to have you. Come on, guys. (Ben chuckles) What's so funny? - I don't want to take my bandages off. You know, I have thought about getting undressed with you I don't know how many times but I ain't doing it now. - (laughs) Well, why not? - Can't be modesty. - Well, I don't want to not see myself. If you know what I mean. Jesus, my eyes! - That's because there's nothing to stop the light reflection on the eyes' surface. Your optics nerves are completely exposed. - Good diagnosis. - Hold still. - [Ben] Ow. - Next time I tell you to wear your shades maybe you'll pay attention. - How long before this stuff takes effect? - Well, Dad's last notes indicate between two and three hours. - So, what do we do until my guest appearance? - I'd like to get to work. - Ryder, do you have everything? - Yes I do. Right here. - Oh, great. Now I'm getting emphysema. - The hardest thing for you to get used to is your hand-eye coordination. That's completely changed now because you can't see them. You'll have to learn to do the simplest things all over again. - Not if the drug works. - Ben, this is just the beginning of the experimentation. There are no guarantees. - Well, I've got my fingers crossed. I mean, who would want to be this way even for five seconds? - You know Ben, this invisibility thing does have it its pluses. You can skip out on checks in restaurants, you can check out the ladies room at the gym. I mean, the possibility are endless. - Ben, if you can light this cigarette, you are my hero. - [Ryder] That's incredible. (chuckles) - Doctor Knox, you must think I'm a fool. - [Knox] Of course not, sir. - To come to me with this strange story about invisible men. You have seen too much American television. - Aren't you the least bit interested in how your predecessor died? A CIA agent was killed with him, you know. - Goodbye, doctor. - There is many involved here. And power. I can help you, sir. If you have the knowledge, you have the power. - Goodbye. - Virginia, bring me the files on Colonel Kolczech and Dr. Karl Zimmer. (thuds) (breathing heavily) - Hold it, Ben. Let's see. Okay. This is steady. What was his last pressure reading? - Uh, 160 over 40. - A regular see through Arnold Schwarzenegger. - Yeah, well Arnold, you better relax for a minute. I am not sure how all this exercise is effecting the Supercon treatment. (yelling) Ben? Come on, you have to talk to me, you have to tell me. Ryder, I'm gonna need some help here. Ryder, hold him! - Hurry! (yelling) - Forget it, Zanna, you'll need a sledgehammer. - I'll cut you in half you metal son of a bitch! (dinking) - Come on! - Stay still. Keep him down, Ryder. (groaning) - I guess I lost it, huh? - (chuckles) You could say that. - Metal son of a bitch. - Hey watch out, you know, I could bring him in here anytime. Ooh. - Wade. How do you deal with it? - Usually? Not very well. - Looks like we both have a lot to get used to. (grunts) (glass shatters) (screaming) - If we don't get lucky soon we may never be able to reverse Ben's condition. - Oh. I'm off to the Supercon chamber again, huh? - What's on the schedule? - Wade and I have a little work to do. - Then you don't need me tonight, right? I'll see you in the morning. - Right, you're the hook again, Ryder. - Come on, Wade. - I'm sorry Zanna, that guy bugs me plain and simple. - He does good work. - He's not the only one. - What's this? - Well... (metal stomping) - This is incredible. Wade, when did you do this? - I've been working on it for a while. The old helmet made me feel like I was playing for the 49ers. Now I'll look like Elvis, the Vegas period. (Zanna laughs) - Hm, well, I've seen a better Elvis. But Wade, this technology is fantastic. - Thank you. (dramatic music) - The kid, he's here. - I'm waiting. Come in, my boy, come in. - Benjamin Knight's come back. - In what condition? - Zanna hasn't found the formula for a cure yet and the one that she tried had side effects. After an injection he had some kind of a... psychotic fit. (laughs) - The Zimmer medical talent is up to its usual standards. The fits can be controlled, you know, with drugs. You concentrate on the Supercon. And be sure to get the special set of specs that Zimmer had always hidden away. That's priority number one. - If I do this for you, you'll release my father? - I will. - I need a guarantee. - I guarantee he will never leave if I don't get the Supercon spec. (laughing) - [Ryder] Dad. (laughs) - I love family reunions. Move your body. - [Ben] Is this absolutely necessary? - It's just a precaution, Ben. I have to give you a bigger dosage this time. - Not that it wasn't fun last time, Ben, watching you tear apart the lab. Ooh, Zanna's gonna give you the big needle. (Ben gasps) - Sorry Ben. So, how are you feeling now? - Okay. What's happening? Get me a mirror. Boy, do I need a shave. - To Zanna Zimmer. If your father were here he'd be very proud. - I had help. - This is permanent. - What? - Me. Being visible. - I'm sorry Ben. The radiation you were exposed to absolutely mutated your body, to stay visible you will have to stay on this drug. I'll figure the dosage and the frequency next. - For the rest of my life? - Probably. - Can I control this thing? - As it is now, if you touch a Supercon crystal you will become invisible so. - Speaking of invisible, where's the perfect little assistant? (tense music) Hey. Zanna doesn't pay overtime. - Oh, ha. There were a few things that needed cleaning, so. - You've already the efficiency award. Take a break. What's wrong? Hey, you don't look so hot. - Uh... I think I'm just gonna go home and get some sleep. - Ryder. You need something? - No. No, I'll be fine. I'll see you in the morning. Congratulations, by the way. (tires screeching) (truck horn blares) (yells) (tense music) (engine hissing) (explosion) (gargling) - I hope you'll be able to identify Mr. Ryder. - [Zanna] Is it that bad? - It's most unusual, doctor. Most unusual. Let them see the corpse. - That's him. - And you're sure? There isn't much of him left. - I'm sure. - This is the most remarkable thing. The state physician has no idea how this condition could have occurred. One of my lieutenants thinks this is a sign from God. Mr. Ryder worked in your lab. How do you think this could have happened? - I don't know. - Then consider yourself under arrest for not cooperating. - [Ben] Jesus, this bench is cold. - Ben? Ben? - Who are you talking to? - Uh, no one. No one. (chuckles) Where are you? - [Ben] I'm about a foot to the right. - How did you get here? - [Ben] I hitched a ride with you guys. I'm getting you the hell outta here. - (chuckles) Crazy one. - Is this the man you talked about? - No, this one helped pick up Benjamin Knight at the hospital. He worked for Zimmer. Has she talked yet? - No, not yet. But I can assure you she will. - I have drugs that are quite efficient if you need some help. Colonel? - Yes? I was just thinking. Imagine what an army of invisible men could do. - Anything, Colonel. They could do anything. - Colonel, how long do you intend to keep us here? - You are free to go at any time. (grunts) - [Ben] Wade, get a head start towards the truck. Come on, come on! - [Zanna] Come on, Ben. - [Ben] Back to work, ladies. Move over! (grunts) (speaking foreign language) (thuds) (grunts) Come on, guys! (engine starts) (alarm beeps) - Go, go, go! - Go on, go on! Come on! (men muttering) (wheels skid) - Woah, hey. - [Ben] Jesus, it's weird not having my hands in front of me. - You're doing great, Ben. You're doing fine. (car beeping) (gun firing) - Get closer! Faster! - Jesus. (gun firing) (gun firing) - Oh. - [Ben] If I get hit, do you think I'll be able to see my blood? - Drive, Ben, drive! (gun firing) (gun firing) (gun firing) (yelling) (explosion) - [Ben] What happened? Did we lose him? Well, we got them off our back. - For about five minutes, Ben. He won't stay down for long. (dramatic music) - Look through these documents and take as many as you can. - Alright. - Zanna, we're never gonna get all this stuff together. We've gotta get outta here. - I know, I know. - So where are we going? - Ow! - There's only one place I can think of. And that's Dad's hold hunting lodge. (tense music) (alarm beeping) Aw, damn, they're here. - We're trapped. - We'll try the backdoor. - They probably have the house surrounded. - Come out with your hands up and no harm will come to you. - [Wade] Ah, Colonel, what a nice surprise. I thought we'd lost you back there. - Where is Dr. Zimmer and that thing? - Oh, I'm sorry, you just missed them. - Search the house. How do you operate this machine? - Well, we're still working on that. I don't mind telling you he's a little temperamental. - Colonel, the house is empty. - Bring this man. And this machine too. (mysterious music) (tense music) (blows) (blows) (blows) - [Ben] Cigarettes are bad for your health. (grunts) (thuds) - Ben, you okay? - [Ben] Piece o' cake. Let's go. - Here, get dressed. (engine starts) - Incompetent stupid idiot. (glass shatters) I told Ryder to be careful! He wasn't smart enough! (sobs) And Zanna has disappeared. Now where would that limited intelligence take her? (birds chirping) - This is great. - [Zanna] Yeah, I haven't been her in a long time. - You keep it really nice. - Well, there's cleaning supplies in the kitchen, Ben. Join me for cocktails? - I'd prefer a margarita. - Sorry, all we've got is Molotov. - Happy hour, huh? - I have a feeling we're gonna need it. - Pretty weird seeing that photo of Drago and your dad up there. - It's hard to believe they were best friends once. Used to come up here all the time. They hunted and talked and when they got back they always had a new idea. It was a good time for all of us. - Yeah. - Well, they're both gone now. Top this off, will you? - [Petroff] Doctor Franklin, I hope you slept well. - Like a prince, thank you. - I have some questions for you that I hope you can answer. - [Wade] Well, I'll certainly try. - First, I would like to know about the death of Dr. Karl Zimmer. - Gee, I dunno anything about that. - Are you associated with a CIA agent called Joe Smith? - Joe Smith? Sorry. (groans) - Now we are on equal footing. - Go to Hell. - One of my soldiers present when Dr. Zimmer was killed talked about this huge robot, indestructible. Unfortunately he was killed and so were all the others present. The only one left was Miss Zimmer. She claimed that they had been ambushed but it was never clear by whom and why. Do you know what I think, Dr. Franklin? - Ask someone who cares. - I think that the CIA was interested in buying this thing. Something went wrong. You wound up in a wheelchair and Dr. Zimmer was killed. - That's a wild story. I guess that's why they pay you the big bucks, right? - Dr. Franklin. You and I are going to have a very, very nice long talk. And you, you are going to tell me everything I want to know. - Woah, woah. That cabin should be empty. Let's have a look. - Ben, here's some more Supercon in case you need to become invisible again. (gargling) (whistles) - What was that? (groans) (chuckling) - We have to come up with a plan to get Wade. He's been in there too long already, Ben. I can count on you, right? - You can always count on me. Don't worry, he's gonna be okay. - Ben... - Hey. Don't worry. I'll just go find myself a nice invisible girl somewhere. - Yeah. - I'm gonna get the stuff out of the car. (grunts) - Why don't you cooperate and free yourself from the misery that you are in? - Misery? Are you kiddin'? I call this character building. - You're a tough man, Dr. Franklin. I can see I have to use a different method with you. Virginia, get Dr. Knox and tell him to bring his drugs. (glass shatters) (men laughing) (screams) (yelling) (screaming) (men yelling) - I wish you hadn't killed my friend! (Zanna screaming) - Hey! (gun firing) (emotional music) (breathing) (footfalls) (man yells in foreign language) (slaps) (yelps) (woman speaks foreign language) - You will just feel a little sting and then we'll talk about everything. - You're too kind. (knocking) - Get on with it. - What? (tense music) - Doctor? (thuds) (grunts) - Ben? - [Ben] I think I need some help. - You invisible son of a bitch. (grunts) - You wanted to know how I worked, Colonel? So study this. (grunts) (groans) - [Ben] Come on, let's get out of here fast. - Good idea. (speaks foreign language) (thuds) (clanks) (thuds) - Hold it! (gun firing) (grunts) (alarm beeping) (engine starts) (guns firing) - [Drago] Find anything interesting? (gasps) - How can you be alive? - There are so many things about the human body you don't understand, Zanna. And that's why the invisibility secret keeps escaping you. - Ryder worked for you, didn't he? - Very good guess. I needed the Supercon formula and now I have it. - You have nothing. - Little Zanna, still trying to be the scientist. You're a lost girl in need of guidance. - Let go of me you son of a bitch! - Ah, a fighting spirit. I like it. You know Zanna, I can think of only one way you'll be of any use to me. (mysterious music) (brakes squeaking) (screaming) (dinnerware clanking) (Drago yells) - Pump, pump, pump. (clapping) Pump, pump, pump. Pump, pump, pump. (exotic music) (men jeering) (beeping) - I can't get up these. You're gonna have to go it alone, okay? - Okay. Let's go. (men yelling) (clapping) - Do you like this, Uncle Ivan? Don't move or I'll slit his throat! - Very impressive, Zanna. - Shut up, you're coming with me. - Why don't you cut my throat, huh? Go ahead, do it! You can't do it, you are too weak, Zanna. - [Drago] Feed on her! - No. No. No! - Don't be afraid. We're here to help you. We're looking for a blonde girl they just brought in. - I don't know. We're not allowed to talk to each other. - Okay. Come on, let's get out of here. (men yelling) - Don't run, Zanna. (screaming) Don't run, Zanna. Why not enjoy the time you have left? (groaning) - She's not here, Ben. - [Ben] Okay. Take the back stairs and get as far away from this place as possible. - Who are you? - [Ben] Never mind that. Just get outta here quick. (tense music) (screams) (Drago yells) - Zanna, dear. You are exactly where I want you to be. (high-pitched scream) - [Ben] What the hell was that? - I don't know, but I don't like it. (men jeering) (Zanna groaning) - How are you feeling, Zanna? - Go to Hell. - Getting a little nervous, my dear? (laughs) (thuds) What are you doing? Imbeciles! Don't be afraid, it's only a machine. Kill the machine! (men yelling) Goodbye, Zanna. - [Ben] Not so fast. (gasps) - Oh, Benjamin, my boy, are you back on your safety pills? (sword slices) (grunts) (yelling) - I'm gonna break you in two. (Drago speaks foreign language) (screams) Hold on, Zanna. I got you. Come on, it's okay. There you are. Are you alright? - Yeah, but Ben is hurt. Ben. Ben, can you hear me? - [Ben] Yeah, he didn't cut of my ears. - Come on guys, we gotta get outta here. - Not yet. I can't let Drago get away a second time. (dagger unsheathes) (yelling) (grunts) (gun firing) (glass shatters) (yells) (intense music) - Now Zanna, end of the road. (gasps) (exhales) No. I need some air. (breathing heavily) (yells) (body thuds) (soothing violin music) - Okay, enemies of the state, let's go. The border's half an hour away. - We haven't decided where we're going yet. - Wasn't it the US? - Ben, it's a big country. - I always wanted to see New York or Los Angeles. - What about Washington? - Washington. - (giggles) Yeah, Washington. I think we'll fit right in. (glasses beep) (engine starts) (epic orchestral music) (soft violin music)
