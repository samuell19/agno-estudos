Peony Lanterns [Botan Dorou] August 13th is the first day of the Festival of Obon, when people honour their ancestors. And when the spirits of the dead return. Onkaimikai. Welcome, sir. Have the spirits already returned? Yes, probably. This is my second son's first Obon. Time flies so quickly. I'm late, forgive me. Don't worry, go in and take your place. Today we invite to our family's house... the spirit of my second son. We shall pray and perform the ceremony. Thank you for inviting me. No, thank you for coming. Once again, thank you. Shinzaburo, tell us something. Don't you understand how your father feels? What do you mean? As you know, Kiku, the wife of Dzendziro, his second son, has been invited here. But Dzendziro died recently in an accident, and now his young wife lives alone. İt's a very bad situation. Her relatives haven't called her back yet. And after what happened, she should become a nun. Perhaps they feel sorry for her. She can't carry on being a young widow. People won't forgive it. So we think that his third son, Shihzaburo, should marry her. But we ask for advice here, in the relatives' house. Shinzaburo, are you dissatisfied? You shouldn’t show your discontent. Shinzaburo, it will be good for your future career. It will be good. It is reasonable. Shinzaburo, this relative has this to say: If I were not the successor, I'd be glad to be in your position. And what do you think? Kiku? Yes? We've already talked about it this morning, Tell your relatives what you think. If it suits you, I agree. Shinzaburo, what do you say? Kiku, you may go. Have you already got a wife? - No. -Well, then... You must make successful career, otherwise you'll be In a difficult position. You must become the head of another house. The fact that you teach poor children to read and write... brings terrible dishonor to our house. Father, I don't agree! Don't you understand yet, Shinzaburo? Thank you for waiting, Sire. If you please, everything is ready. I can't permit you to do what you want. Is that clear? August 16th - The Day When the Spirits Return I'm sorry I'm late. Mr. Banzo, we're waiting for you. Well, let's go. Come back #om paradise The six realms of existence Are full of suffering The present reflects the past When you are between paradise and Hell, there's nothing to hope for There's no escape - What happened? - My lantern's caught! Float! Thank you, Mr. Teacher. Many thanks for our lanterns. For what? You helped start our lanterns along the river. We're very glad, aren't we? Good-bye. What's wrong? Nothing. Thank you all for your work. Many thanks. It was great fun. Good night! - Mr. Shinzaburom - What do you want? Well... Money for expenses again? That's that... Many thanks, excuse me, good night. Banzo! Your wife will be back home soon. Be careful what you get up to. What are you saying? I can't behave myself? Excuse me, please... Excuse me, please... - Oh, it’s you again. - We've come to thank you. - it's not necessary to thank me again. - No... But you are a very kind person. it's rare to meet such people now. Madam wishes very much to talk to you. 'l'hat's why she asked me... Please forgive us for troubling you. That's quite all right, but I've nothing to give you. It doesn't matter. Can we enter? Please, come in. Madam, he has given permission! Madam's name is Otsuyu. And I am Oyone. We are from the red light district. You're probably not going to like what I tell you about madam We're from Yoshiwara Madam Otsuyu is known professionally as Tamamushi, and I'm a waitress. They sell special flowers here for the festival. For the lantern fair. Did you know that? No, I only know about this district from books. During Obon, the girls of the district... can ask permission to "come out". Why do you call her "madam"'? Madam Tamamushi wasn't always in this distressing situation. Her father was ordered to serve the feudal prince in the west of Edo, but then the Tickle prince changed his mind. Her father left his house, wandered for a long time, and became ill. My mother left the house... and our relatives disowned us. There was nobody who could help. Then Otsuyu put trust in a moneylender, who turned out to be a nasty person. He produced the IOU, took madam away from her sick father, brought her to Yoshiwara and sold her. And what happened to her father? From that day on he ate nothing, cried all the time... And then he died. What a terrible story. Fortunately, madam came from a Samurai family, so she's had a good education. Madam was trained in tea ceremonies, ikebana, singing and playing the koto and the samisen. And she's still a virgin. Thanks to her talents, she became the main Courtesan. The owner felt sorry for her and allowed her to have ho clients for three months. But one elderly man has fallen in love with her. Recently, he gave her a gift. When this Obon festival is over, she has to show her gratitude to him. Poor madam! it's terrible. It seems that madam likes you, and while she can leave the district... she would like to be with you. Oyone, what are you saying? I knew that you'd get angry. Please... To talk about such things... it's impolite Forgive us! What's your name? Hagiwara Shinzaburo The second son in a Hatamoto family. There were many children around you, weren't there? They're children from poor houses. I teach them to read and to write. People who think only of glory and honour... don't consider the poor to be human beings. They leave them to the mercy of fate. I don't feel any sympathy for my Samurai relatives. They don't allow poor children to be educated. And I want to bring up these innocent children to be glorious people. I have a dream to open a school for them in the future. My family thinks it's nonsense. They won't even meet me halfway. İt's a wonderful ambition. I can see from your vision... that you're very strong-willed. Why are you hesitating? Madam, madam! Mr. Shinzaburo! Mr. Shinzaburo! Could you please wait a little while for the money? Your master should pay your debt! Certainly, he will pay! Don't come to the gambling house anymore! Get out! Excuse us. We're late. Oyone, from Tigyo's place? And the other girl is Tamamushi, I suppose. Bu y! Very cheap! Very good gifts #om Etigo! "If a person isn't lazy..." - Don't make a noise; the children are studying. - Mr. Hagiwara will get angry. - I'm sorry. - Hey, merchant! - Hey, merchant. Give me 10 sweets. - You want to buy? Many thanks. Thank you very much. Well, children, try once again. - "Confucius;s says..." - "Confucius says, "that all people want to be rich and noble. "If people are hardworking, their lives become quiet and serene. "He says that people do not want to be poor and of low origin. "If a person isn't lazy... "he can avoid a life of poverty." Perfect. Well done. Here are some sweets for you. Mr. Shinzaburo, your mother's here. Mr. Teacher, thank you very much. How can you live in such a house? Do you have some business with me? Shinzaburo, come back home as soon as possible No. Your reply shows me that you don't have any feelings, but Kiku will be a good wife for you. All the people in the village worry about Kiku. And that's why I should marry her? - Is that what you're saying? - Shinzaburo, listen to me. If you become a member of Kiku's family, it will be of great benefit to our house. I can't marry simply because it's good for our family. - It's only a formality. - We don't love each other! If you refuse, we shall disown you. Your father said so. Shinzaburo, please do as he orders. Hi! Thank you very much. - So you're still alive? - What are you talking about? I haven’t seen you for a long time. Now my master works at the school I have to behave modestly; I can't live it up. You've got no-one to go with you to a tavern. I know one good place. - Let's drink? - I suppose I'm paying? - Come on, let's go! - OK! Here, please. - Girl! - Yes? - Bring one more cup. - Yes. Your master will want to know about my master's secret meeting. He'd pay for the information. Tell him about it, - and I'll get some money. - Who are the women? One of them is Oyone, the waitress from Kikyo, the ether's a prostitute, Tamamushi. What's the matter? Are you sure? - Yes, I saw them myself. - In that case, we won't get any money. Why not? Because they're ghosts. Those women are dead. Is that a joke? You should'n joke with me like that. Hey girl, hurry! I'm not lying: it's the truth. But I really saw them, with my own eyes. I tell you, they're ghosts. One man fell in love with Tamamushi... and took her to his castle on the cape, but he died on the first night. And then she out her throat. Oyone was a servant there. She died together with them. Yes, girl? If you think I'm lying, go to the place where she used to work and ask. İt's the first Obon for them, so that’s probably why they can return. But why have they appeared to your master? Sir, when did you see them? Hey, Banzo! Pay the bill! When did you come? Forgive us for entering without your permission. Never mind. How are you? For the sake of my family, I'm forced to do something impossible. If l disobey, my family will damn me. Your father left his house because of a Tickle prince. Why should we live, submitting to their callousness? Your master and my parents can do what they want, because they have power. I've lost all respect for Samurais If I had money, I'd like to pay for you and to live with you. Do you really mean that? But I can't do it. it's sad. No, we're very glad to hear these words! Madam! Mr. Shinzaburo, at least she can be your bride for the period of the Obon festival. Madam, what happiness! Let's celebrate your union now. It lasts only for the festival, but your hearts will never change... and you will remain husband and wife forever. İt's a symbol. This mirror is a family relic from madam's house. Accept it, please. Wait just a little. Whats he talking about? There are HO ghosts here. Mr. Shinzaburo! Oh, I can't take it. Hey, I'm home. Dammit! Hey, wife, dammit! Sensei! Sensei! Open the door! - What's happened? - Please, open the door! I'm opening it. Banzo, whats happened? Water, water! Give me water! Water! This isn’t like you. What's happened? Tell me. Drink this Ghosts! Ghosts? Mr. Shinzaburo is sleeping with a ghost-woman! An assignation with a ghost... I read something similar in a Shinano book, but it's nonsense. Sensei, you shouldn't treat it so lightly! I saw it with my own eyes. Thank you very much, Mr. Teacher! Yes, there's a really serious problem here. His face is marked by a seal of death. Really? Nonsense! they’re not ghosts. They've given me a fine gift: a family heirloom. How could a ghost do that? Besides, it's just for a short while, only for Obon. You shouldn’t meet them. If you continue to do so, you'll die. You teach poor people. it's not easy to ind someone who'll do that. For the sake of the children... tell the ghosts tonight: "We must not meet again". Well? Why are you doing this? Why are you treating these women so badly? If you really think they're ghosts, what are you going to do? Banzo, who have you told? No-one. I just thought that Sensei... Leave! Leave! Sensei, let's go. He doesn't believe us. Nonsense! What nonsense! Tell me please, if there's a castle on this cape, where the waitress from Yoshiwara used to live? The castles over there. Are you connected with it somehow? I'm looking for a girl called Otsuyu and her servant, Oyone. Are you sure that was their names? - Aren't they here now? - No. Is it really true that they're dead? I don't know who they were, but after the wedding, both of them died. Do you know where they were buried? In a Buddhist temple: Shimbandzuiin. - Someone's been here already. - Who could have done this? Someone's opened the graves. Very bad. These are the graves of Otsuyu and Oyone. Someone has stolen a mirror! A mirror? - Master, welcome home! - It was hot today, wasn't it? Banzo, master has returned! Welcome home! Where've you been, Sensei? - Wo's there? - it's Banzo! I've brought your supper. Don't come in! Leave! Leave! Ten o'clock! Ten o'clock! How is your master? He believed me at last. He's locked his door, and won't let anybody enter. That's good. The ghosts will arrive soon. We should leave here quickly, before they can possess us. Ten o'clock! Oyone, I want to see Shinzaburo as soon as possible Good evening! Madam, you don't need my help anymore, do you? No. - I'll prepare the bed for you now. - Stop! What's wrong? You're not normal people. Why do you say that? You're not alive! Us? What do you mean? I went to the cape and was told that you're both dead... and I saw that your graves are empty, and the mirror that was there has disappeared. Who are you really? Tell me the truth. Do you think... that we are... thieves? No, I think... I think that you are... You think that we are... what? Mr. Shinzaburom You made love with madam, and now you want to kill her. Sensei! İt's Banzo! Sensei! Be careful! Be careful! Mr. Shinzaburo, forgive us. I understand why you lost your temper. Please forgive us for lying. If you know that we are ghosts, it's a pity... that you are so cruel. Why don't you ask us... how we died? About Madam... If you knew why madam died, you would approve of her deed! By killing herself, she showed that this cruel world was intolerable for her. Why don't you tell her, "l will kill myself too, and follow you!" You shouldn’t say that, Oyone. He knows who we are. Do you want to stop seeing him? Do you really want to? Mr. Shinzaburo, please. There are just three days until the 20th, can't you keep meeting her, just for three more days? Mr. Shinzaburo, I wish I'd met you while I was alive! Otsuyu! Mr. Shinzaburo! Good morning! Good morning! Shinzaburo, have you slept? Something happened yesterday. Sensei, do you remember last night? You shouted loudly, I thought something had happened and I came to you. You brandished your sword and then you attacked me. You? Last night the ghosts came again. Did you see them? Banzo, I definitely know now that they are dead. I went to the cape to see for myself. I saw their graves... They were empty. And someone had stolen a mirror. You've learnt so much! Have you told them that you won't meet them anymore? Have you? But that woman died to protest against this cruel world. She has proved her courage. - Sensei! - You look so different after last night! You're so pale! I couldn't turn them away! Why did you allow them? Perhaps the head of the temple will be able to help. This person is very kind to us poor people. He teaches our children to read and write. Sir, sir, our children miss him. Please, help us! Mukaebi ire calls the spirits of the dead for the Obon festival. But on the 16th they return to paradise. However, the souls of restless spirits... continue to wander on the Earth until the 20th. There are two Clays left: tonight and the next. If they don't meet anymore, it will save the teacher's life. Sir, please, help us! Please! Mr. Hagiwara, we are forced to lock you in Komori temple for two days. And over the doors and windows we shall post scrolls with prayers and charms, so no ghosts can enter. For the sake of the children, sir, please, listen to him. Sir, please listen. Thank you very much! Don't worry. Sensei's illness will soon pass. Good, good. Here is food for two days. Please, be patient. Sir, you mustn't remove the prayers. OK? Sir, you shouldn’t remove these scrolls. Nobody should touch them. None of them should be moved. You should stay in your houses after dark. Do you understand? Madam! - What's happened, Oyone? - Charms. Charms, everywhere! What? And here as well. it's awful. Mr. Shinzaburo! - Oyone... - Yesterday you promised, what happened? Mr Shinzaburo, this is cruel! It's cruel! My decision hasn’t changed. My feelings are still the same. But why are these scrolls here? İt's for the sake of the children of the poor: I need to live, for their sake. You should meet her, she has to return to the underworld soon. Please, leave me and go back to your world. I want to live to improve this world, where you suffered so. Please, abandon these meetings. Please tear the scrolls off! Mr. Shinzaburo! Pf ease, tear them off-' Mr. Shinzaburo, please tear them off. Mr. Shinzaburo, please tear them off. Don't you love madam? Don't you care that she's suffering? Hey in there, open up! There's no one here. Are you at home? Open up! Omine? What are you up to? Nothing special! Nothing special! Nothing special? Why have you got home so late? - Is there someone else here? - Don't say that! it's serious! They come to Mr. Shinzaburo's house... Ghosts! What are you talking about? - Fool! Fool! What have you done? - Don't shout so loudly. - Did you see something outside? - I saw nothing! I was almost back here, but my foot started to hurt. If someone knocks on the door, it can only be me, get it? Well, both of us are at home now, so let's close the door. You've started again. Ghosts are just tales for children, but some adults believe in them, too. I'm very tired and I'm going to bed. Omine, have you fallen asleep so quickly? I haven’t seen you for a long time. I've had a terrible night. What are you doing? Haven't seen you for a long time, Mr. Banzo. Haven't seen you for a long time, Madam Oyone I feel guilty. Think about the past. I did you harm. Please, rest in peace. That's over and done with. Please, tear the scrolls off. I can't It would be very bad. Forgive me. Pf ease, don? refuse. It will be morning soon. Good-bye. I will come again tomorrow night. Tear the scrolls off by then. You were hiding someone. Damn you! No, no, no, she was one of those ghosts! Once a year, during the Obon festival, I get leave from my job... and I rush to come home, and you have a woman here! In this house! Who is she? İt's not like that, you fool! She's the waitress from Yoshiwara She committed suicide together with the prostitute. Ghosts, ghosts! Stop trying to deceive me! I'll tell everyone about you! Wait! You, you... Well, damn you! Omine, Omine, you can ask anyone! I've never lied to you! You're the best, you know that. Don't say that! Damn! There's only one night left, don't worry. Well, do you believe me now? They asked me to tear the scrolls off. Did you agree? I had no time to answer because morning came and they left. They'll return tonight. I'm trembling! Omine, it’s only one night. We'll escape Somewhere. No, we won't. Then what should we do? - Ask them for money. - What? Listen to me. Tell them this: our family depends on what Mr. Hagiwara pays us. If something happens to him, we'll be destitute. If we had 100 ryo to live on, things would be different. Tell them that! Shall we tear the scrolls down, then? But if we do that, master could die. Let him die. Anyway, at least he'll have fallen in love once. So what if it was with a ghost! But ghosts don't have feet. Be serious! Ask them. İt'll be great if they bring the money. If I had 100 ryo, I could leave my job. If they don't bring it, it will be very bad. Au right! But about the negotiations... You should handle all that. But maybe you... What's the matter? You're a coward! They won't trust me, because I'm a woman. But me, too... - What? - No, no, nothing. OK! We're going to get 100 ryo! Sensei, whats happened? There's only one night to go. Stay at home and pray. - Where will we pray? - Just here. No, we refuse! What's the matter? Give me a futon! I'm very cold suddenly. I'm very sick. Again? As soon as I heard about ghosts, I was trembling again. Forgive me. - Oh, that's bad. - Then you should pray in some other place. We wanted to pray close to your master, but if you're sick, the drums will disturb you. Excuse me, please. - Omine, it's OK, OK. - Cold... it's cold... Forgive us for this. - Take care! - Yes, yes! Why did you feel cold suddenly? Are you OK now? İt's hot! Why have you given me this futon, fool! Even if they agree, we can refuse at the last moment. it's hot! They’re here! - Ouch! - You're afraid? Me, too... Be strong! Hey, wife! Mr Banzo! Excuse me, but the scrolls are still there, and we can't enter. Madam mustn’t suffer any more. Mr. Banzo, show your compassion, Please, the scrolls... My wife and I can hardly make ends meet, and that's only thanks to Master Shinzaburo How will we survive if something happens to him? We're in a difficult situation... 100 ryo! If you bring 100 ryo, I'll remove the scrolls at once. 100 ryo! 100 ryo? You're very rude! Husband, be strong! If you don't do what we ask, we won't do what you ask. But we haven’t got that sort of money. We can't help you. That's it, then... We should give up. This is the last night. If you don't help us, we'll return to the underworld! Please! Mr. Banzo, I hate you. Madam Oyone. Wait! Madam Oyone! Madam Oyone! What are you doing? Why don't you do something? - Well, you... - Tell them to bring the money. Calm down, it isn't our destiny to be rich. And besides, ghosts have no way to get money. Hey, we've saved the life of the teacher; why aren't you glad? I'm going. I'm going to pray with the others. I'll tell them all about it. - they’re here! Money! - What did you say? Ghosts, are you here? If you don't have the money, get out! Madam... In Shimbandzuiin cemetery... Search to the north... The second grave from ours. There you will ind money. Then come back at once and tear down the scrolls! Do not fail us. - OK, we understood, we understood... - What did you say? Have they left already'? - Well? - Perhaps it's the truth. Go! Go? Me, alone? I'll go with you. lf the 100 ryo is there, we'll disappear quickly. Will everything be OK? They’re only ghosts! Even if we ind the money there, there's absolutely no need to kill Mr. Shinzaburo The ghosts could overhear us. Well, then! Either we'll get rich, or not. We'll know soon! What is it? Otsuyu... Oyone Really, it's written here! Really? From here -to the north. The first... The second... Here! İt's too dark. - I've found something! - What? Gold! Gold! Look! - 100 ryo? - Yes. 100 ryo! But how could the ghosts have known about it? - It doesn’t matter. - Let's go! Now! Now! Hurry! What are you waiting for? Hey, wait a minute! Have you found the money? Are you happy? Yes, yes, we're happy. Then go and remove the scrolls quickly! Please! Mr. Banzo, now! You're a coward, even though you're a man! I am happy. Now I can see Mr. Shinzaburo! Thank you. Remove them, quickly! Madam, now. Otsuyu! Don't send me away. We'll go to the underworld together. And you'll be husband and wife there forever. - Otsuyu? - I'm so happy. Mr. Shinzaburo is mine! İt's dawn already. Thank you for all your prayers. Well, let's go to Mr. Hagiwara Let's hurry. Hurry, remove the scrolls! - Sensei, it's terrible! - What is it? This scroll is torn! - Call Banzo! - Right! - He's hot here. - What? Not here? Both of them are missing. - Is your bag very heavy? - Yes, very. Could it be stones? Hey, hey, don't frighten me! Everything's all right. The ghosts have returned to their world today. - Yes. So? - So they can't appear to us anymore. Definitely! - Welcome. - We should go. - Shimbandzuiin cemetery. - The cemetery? It was terrible and dark there last night. Do you think there's more there? Oh, you're so bad. What do you say? Let's go and check. - You're a very good wife. - You said it. Please take... - Found something! - What? - it's a bone. - Don't do that! Hey, are you stealing our hidden money? No... we... Well? What do you say? - Ghosts, ghosts! - What? Are you an idiot? There are no ghosts nowadays! Forgive us! - You Suggested we come back! - No, it was you! Let's get out of here!
