♪♪♪♪ Barbara: ON MARCH 8th, 1982, A LINE FORMED OUTSIDE A FUNERAL PARLOR IN NEW YORK CITY. I STOOD THERE IN THE COLD WITH HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE, WAITING TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO AN OLD WOMAN FEW OF THEM HAD EVER MET. YET MOST OF THOSE PEOPLE WOULD'VE SAID SHE CHANGED THEIR LIVES. I HAD BEEN HER CLOSEST FRIEND, AND SHE MINE, BUT ALL OF THAT ENDED A LONG TIME AGO. THE BODY WILL BE ON VIEW FOR THE NEXT TWO HOURS. IN THE INTEREST OF OTHERS, WE ASK THAT YOU KEEP YOUR TIME BEFORE THE CASKET BRIEF. "IN THE INTEREST OF OTHERS." EXCUSE ME? I DON'T THINK SHE WOULD'VE LIKED THAT. MA'AM, WE NEED TO KEEP MOVING. THE CRITICS HAD CALLED HER THE LEADER OF A CULT, A DANGEROUS THREAT TO PUBLIC MORALITY. HER NAME WAS AYN RAND, AND I LOVED HER. ( buzzer ringing ) HELLO. I HOPE WE'RE IN THE RIGHT PLACE. YES, SHE'S EXPECTING YOU. UH, ARE--ARE YOU MR. RAND? I SUPPOSE I AM. HELLO. I'M ACTUALLY FRANK O'CONNOR. PLEASE CALL ME FRANK. ( whispers ) This is right out of the book. WELL, THEY'RE HERE. YOU ARE NATHANIEL BLUMENTHAL? YES. AND? BARBARA. WEIDMAN. MISS RAND, I-- I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR-- FOR TAKING THE TIME TO SEE US. AS YOU MAY RECALL FROM MY LETTER, I HAVE SEVERAL SPECIFIC QUESTIONS REGARDING THE PHILOSOPHICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS OF YOUR NOVELS... TELL ME YOUR PRINCIPLES. TO THINK FOR MYSELF. TO REACH MY OWN CONCLUSIONS. TO SEEK TRUTH, WHEREVER IT MIGHT LEAD. AND BARBARA WHITEMAN, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY FOR YOURSELF? MISS RAND, UH, I PICKED UP THE FOUNTAINHEAD WHEN I GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL. I READ IT IN ONE NIGHT. IT CHANGED MY LIFE. DO YOU SEE, FRANK? SEE THESE TWO... BEAUTIFUL YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME TO OUR HOUSE. COME IN, COME IN, SIT. ♪♪♪♪ WOW. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? IT HAPPENED, BUT I-- WE SPENT THE WHOLE NIGHT TALKING TO AYN RAND! YES! OH. I FEEL AS IF... AS IF MY WHOLE LIFE I'VE BEEN ON A LEAKY RAFT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN, AND AS SOON AS I COVER ONE LEAK WITH MY FOOT, THERE'S ANOTHER... ALONE AND SINKING. YES, YES. BUT AFTER TONIGHT, I THINK... IT'S POSSIBLE TO STAND ON SOLID GROUND, TO UNDERSTAND, TO REALLY KNOW! YEAH, THE WAY SHE LOOKED AT ME? MM-HMM. I FELT SHE SAW EVERYTHING ALL AT ONCE. I ALMOST WANTED TO CRY. WHY? I DON'T KNOW. I FELT RELIEVED AND SAFE. I FELT-- WE SHOULD QUIT SCHOOL. NOTHING HERE COMES CLOSE TO HER. LET'S QUIT. NATHAN! I MEAN IT. I CAN'T BELIEVE I HAVE PHILOSOPHY IN THREE HOURS. YOU THINK YOU'LL GET IN TROUBLE FOR BEING OUT SO LATE? I'LL THINK OF SOMETHING. BARBARA. NATHAN... NO, NO, NO. I JUST WANTED TO SAY THIS WAS... WELL... THIS WAS THE FIRST DAY OF MY LIFE THAT ACTUALLY MATTERED, AND I CAN'T THINK OF ANYONE ELSE I'D RATHER SHARE IT WITH. NO ONE ELSE WOULD'VE UNDERSTOOD, AND, WELL, THAT'S ALL. I THINK YOU'RE BRILLIANT, NATHAN, YOU KNOW THAT? NO ONE'S LIKE YOU. ( chuckles ) GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU. I NEED TO BE ABLE TO SHOW WHY SOMETHING'S RIGHT OR WRONG. I HATE GIVING IN WHEN I KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT... OR BETTER. I NEED TO BE ABLE TO PROVE IT. IT'S NO GOOD OTHERWISE, IS IT? SIT HERE. PRETTY GIRL. DO YOU MAKE LOVE WITH NATHANIEL? NO. BARBARA, YOU MUST TELL ME. OTHERWISE, HOW CAN I HELP YOU WITH THIS CONFUSION? I LOVE HIM, BUT I'M NOT IN LOVE. WE DON'T MAKE LOVE. IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT. YOU DON'T LIKE TO MAKE LOVE? I DIDN'T SAY THAT. YOU RESPECT HIS INTELLECT? VERY MUCH. YOU SHARE THE SAME PRINCIPLES? ABSOLUTELY. YOU ACCEPT THAT EMOTION ULTIMATELY DERIVES FROM THE THINKING ONE HAS DONE OR HAS FAILED TO DO? I DO. THEN THERE IS ONLY ONE POSSIBLY CONCLUSION. NATHAN IS YOUR IDEAL MAN. YOUR MIND ALREADY KNOWS THIS. YOUR FEELINGS MUST FOLLOW THAT LOGIC. WHAT IF LOGIC WASN'T INVOLVED? I CAN EXPLAIN EVERY EMOTION I HAVE EVER HAD, BECAUSE THIS IS THE FOUNDATION, YOU SEE? OTHERWISE, CONFLICT IN ALL OTHER PARTS OF YOUR LIFE. DO YOU KNOW WHO YOU REMIND ME OF? NO. MYSELF. I KNOW WHAT KIND OF INJUSTICE AN INTELLECTUAL YOUNG GIRL HAS TO SUFFER. BUT I WILL SEE THAT NO HARM COMES TO YOU. YOU WATCH, YOU LISTEN, THE WORLD SEEMS SO CONFUSING, INCONSISTENT... PEOPLE... YOU WANT CLARITY, YOU WANT COHERENCE, YOU WANT TO KNOW GREATNESS. YES. THEN YOU MUST BE RUTHLESS IN YOUR SEARCH, STARTING HERE. PROMISE YOU WON'T DISAPPOINT ME. I PROMISE. I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING OTHER BUSINESSMEN AREN'T DOING. YOU CALL YOURSELF A CAPITALIST? I CALL MYSELF A BUSINESSMAN. ( chatter ) HERE YOU ARE. JUST THE WAY I LIKE 'EM. LET'S GO FIND MINE. THESE PEOPLE, WHO ARE THEY? HOLLYWOOD RETIRED REPUBLICAN LEAGUE. REALLY? NO, JUST FOOLING. HE OWNS A CHAIN OF LAUNDROMATS. HE MAKES AIRPLANE PARTS. YOU HAVEN'T MET ALFRED YET, BUT I'M SURE YOU REMEMBER NATHANIEL. SHE'S, UH, TRYING TO GET THEM TO PUT THEIR MONEY WHERE THEIR MOUTHS ARE. THE NEWSLETTER. A WHAT? A PHILOSOPHICAL NEWSLETTER FOR THE COMMON MAN. WE DISCUSSED IT. UH, YOU AND HER? MM-HMM. NOW, WHERE DID SHE FIND YOU? I WROTE HER A LETTER AND INCLUDED MY PHONE NUMBER. SHE CALLED YOU? HUH. YOU KNOW ABOUT THE BOOK? WHAT BOOK? THE NEW BOOK. DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT? IT'S GONNA BE ENORMOUS AND BRILLIANT. THE FOUNTAINHEAD WILL LOOK LIKE A FOOTNOTE. WHAT IS IT? ATLAS SHRUGGED. ATLAS? ATLAS SHRUGGED. YEAH, BUT WHAT'S IT ABOUT? IT'S, UH... WELL, I DON'T KNOW. I HAVEN'T READ... SHE HASN'T FINISHED WRITING IT YET, BUT I... SHE, UH, CALLED YOU? A SCREENWRITER IS... IS AN EMPLOYEE. YOU'RE BOUGHT AND PAID FOR, IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME? UNLIKE YOU, I'M NOT IN A POSITION TO MAKE ANY DEMANDS. MAYBE AFTER I... SO, ALFRED, ON YOUR NEXT PICTURE, THEY SAY, "WE WANT YOU TO WRITE A SCRIPT ABOUT A GREEDY INDUSTRIALIST, "ABOUT THE NOBILITY OF FAILURE, ABOUT LITTLE PEOPLE BANDING TOGETHER," AND YOU DON'T. IN SPITE OF ALL I HAVE SAID TO YOU, YOU WILL DO IT, BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST AN EMPLOYEE. IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME? ANY, EVERY DAY, I'M RACKED WITH TREMENDOUS GUILT. YOU KNOW THAT. WHAT? I ADMIT I FEEL GUILT. UH, WOULD ANYBODY LIKE A NIGHTCAP? NO, I THINK I'D BETTER GO. IT'S... LONG DRIVE HOME. ♪♪♪♪ Ayn: WELL, WHAT DO WE THINK OF ALFRED? Barbara: HE SEEMS CONFLICTED BETWEEN HIS NEEDS AND HIS VALUES. HE'S WEAK. AH! OH! TERRIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT. I UNDERSTAND THERE'S A NEW BOOK. NO, IT'S NOT A BOOK YET. WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO SEE SOME OF IT? WHY SHOULD I POSSIBLY SHOW IT TO YOU? WELL, BECAUSE I'D BE YOUR BEST READER AND YOUR MOST HONEST CRITIC. COME ALONG. OH, COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO. NOBODY HERE BUT US CHICKENS. ♪♪♪♪ UHH! ( panting ) AHH! UH... AHH. OH, I LOVE YOU. OH, I REALLY... I REALLY LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU TOO. NATHANIEL BRANDEN, WILL YOU TAKE BARBARA WEIDMAN, HERE PRESENT, AS YOUR LAWFUL WIFE? I WILL. BARBARA WEIDMAN, WILL YOU TAKE NATHANIEL BRANDEN, HERE PRESENT, AS YOUR LAWFUL HUSBAND? I WILL. YOU MAY NOW EXCHANGE THE RINGS. BY THE POWER AND AUTHORITY VESTED BY LAW, AS A CLERK OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU MAN AND WIFE. ♪♪♪♪ THANK YOU FOR THE BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS, FRANK. THAT'S WHAT I DO BEST. SO, MR. BRANDEN. YES. DO YOU LIKE IT? A NEW MAN NEEDS A NEW NAME, YES? SO MANY NEW THINGS, NATHAN... NEW BRIDE, NEW CITY, NEW LIFE. NEW YORK. WE'LL MISS YOU. YOU WILL? YES. IT WILL BE LIKE... LIKE SHUTTING OFF A LIGHT. MAYBE YOU'LL FIND ANOTHER LIGHT. THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE. NO. MUSIC WAS ALWAYS MY PLEASURE WHEN I WAS A CHILD IN ST. PETERSBURG. I ALMOST WORE OUT THE PHONOGRAPH PLAYING MY TITILLATING MUSIC. "IT'S A LONG WAY TO TIPPERARY," "COME ON, GET HAPPY." A LITTLE GIRL DANCING AROUND AND AROUND MY ROOM. AND MY MOTHER SAYING, "WHY DO YOU LISTEN TO SUCH NONSENSE? "BACH, MOZART, BEETHOVEN IF YOU MUST, "BUT THIS? SUCH A-- SUCH A BRIGHT MIND, ALICE, AND SUCH TERRIBLE TASTE." ( chuckles ) BUT THIS WAS MINE, YOU SEE, MY DISCOVERY, MY JOY, AND THIS THEY COULD NOT TAKE AWAY FROM ME. THOSE SOVIETS. THEY TOOK AWAY EVERYTHING ELSE. THE PHONOGRAPH, THE HOUSE. THE PHONOGRAPH WAS IN MY LIFE IN THAT HOUSE. BUT NOT WHAT WAS MINE. THAT I WOULD NOT SURRENDER, THE IDEA OF JOY. BECAUSE IF-- IF I COULD HEAR IT IN THE MUSIC, THEN IT HAD TO EXIST... SOMEWHERE. ( music stops ) WOULD YOU LIKE TO DANCE, AYN? ♪♪♪♪ Nathaniel: WE'LL MISS YOU. IT'LL BE LIKE SHUTTING OFF A LIGHT. Ayn: YOU MUST GO TO NEW YORK. YOU MUST DRIVE YOUR PROFESSORS MAD WITH THE LOGIC OF YOUR ARGUMENTS, AND YOU MUST BECOME A BRILLIANT PSYCHOLOGIST. THEN I WILL TELL THE WORLD THIS IS THE MAN I HAVE CHOSEN TO CARRY ON MY WORK... THIS NEW MAN. FRANK. FLUFF, LOOK, THE HYACINTHS. I'VE ALWAYS HAD SUCH TROUBLE WITH THEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA. LOOKS LIKE WE'LL HAVE A BLOOM SOON. I LOVE THE FRAGRANCE-- FRANK, I CAN'T WORK HERE ANYMORE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? HERE, IN LOS ANGELES. WHERE COULD YOU WORK? NEW YORK. I-I NEED TO BE IN NEW YORK, FOR MYSELF, FOR ATLAS SHRUGGED, FOR MY WORK. I NEED THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF MAN AROUND ME, NOT ALL THE PALM TREES AND HOT DOG STANDS. NO, NO, NEW YORK. NEW YORK IS WHERE WE BELONG. NEAR NATHAN AND BARBARA. THEY'LL BE THERE, YES. AYN... I LOVE THIS PLACE. FRANK, FRANK. BE A HERO FOR ME... AGAIN. NOT SO GENTLY. MUST YOU ALWAYS ASK MY PERMISSION? ( horns blaring ) Barbara: I MUST CONTINUE QUERYING. ( phone ringing ) HELLO. I MUST WORK TO RESOLVE MY UNIDENTIFIED PROBLEMS. OH, GREAT! NO, NO, OF COURSE NOT. I MUST LEARN TO RESPOND TO NATHANIEL... WELL, WHENEVER'S CONVENIENT. ...AS I SHOULD... YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT TOO EXHAUSTED? GREAT. WE-WE'LL BE RIGHT OVER. BYE-BYE. ...AS I WANT. WELL, THEY'RE FINALLY HERE. SHE WANTS TO SEE US NOW. WHAT ABOUT OUR CLASSES? NATHAN! Ayn: OH! AFTER ONE HOUR HERE, I FEEL MORE STIMULATIONS THAN AFTER EIGHT YEARS IN CALIFORNIA. AND FRANK FEELS THE SAME WAY, DON'T YOU, CUBBY? Frank: IT'S CERTAINLY DIFFERENT. Nathaniel: AND ATLAS? Ayn: NOT MUCH LONGER. WHEN I'M DONE, THEY ARE GOING TO WANT MY HEAD. Nathaniel: OH, I THINK THE LEFT'S JUST AFRAID OF YOU. HA! I DON'T CARE ABOUT THEM. NO, NO, IT'S THE CONSERVATIVES I CAN'T STAND, WITH THEIR SUNDAY SERMON MENTALITY AND THEIR THICK LITTLE SKULLS. THEN WHAT ARE YOU? ME? I'M ALONE. NO. NO, I AM A RADICAL FOR CAPITALISM... AND THIS IS MY FLAG. Ayn: IS THE MARRIAGE WORKING? I THINK WE'RE IMPROVING. WE ARE. AND NOW THAT YOU'RE HERE, MAYBE... ARE YOU HAPPY? WELL... THAT'S A DIFFICULT QUESTION. NATHAN, YOU ARE A HEROIC BEING. TO BE HAPPY IS THE MORAL PURPOSE OF YOUR LIFE. YES, I KNOW. I KNOW, BUT BARBARA... SHE NEEDS SOMEONE TO GUIDE HER TO HERSELF. SHE'S AWARE OF THE PROBLEM, AND I'VE BEEN TRYING TO HELP HER. THE MAN MUST HAVE THE WOMAN WHO REFLECTS HIS DEEPEST VISION OF HIMSELF, AND IN HER SURRENDER IS HIS HAPPINESS. AND THE WOMAN? MUST WORSHIP THE HERO. IS THAT HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT FRANK? YES, OF COURSE. ♪♪♪♪ DO YOU LOVE ME, BARBARA? OF COURSE. WHY CAN'T YOU SHOW IT, THEN? ( sighs ) I'M TRYING TO. I'M GETTING BETTER, AREN'T I? I--I THINK I AM. I'M JUST... NOT IN THE MOOD. NO, I'M NOT. YOU EXPECT SO MUCH FROM ME. I FEEL I'M ALWAYS BEING HELD UP TO SOME IDEAL-- I SUPPOSE I'M NOT. ( water running) WHAT WERE YOU TALKING ABOUT WITH AYN? HER BOOK, MY PSYCHOLOGY CLASSES. TOLD HER ABOUT DAVID AND AARON. SHE ACTUALLY MADE A JOKE. SAID THAT WE SHOULD GET TOGETHER SATURDAY NIGHT AND CALL OURSELVES A COLLECTIVE. DID YOU TALK ABOUT ME? NATHAN, DID YOU TALK ABOUT ME? WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW, BARBARA? DID YOU DISCUSS OUR PROBLEMS WITH SOMEONE OUTSIDE OUR MARRIAGE? OUR PROBLEMS? YOU MEAN OUR ANXIETIES? OUR LOW SELF-ESTEEM, OUR HATING SEX WITH OUR HUSBAND? WHAT A HAPPY FUCKING HOME. NATHAN AND BARBARA HAVE TOLD ME THAT ALL OF YOU AGREE WITH MY CONCEPT OF SELF-INTEREST. YES. ABSOLUTELY. COULD YOU TELL US WHY YOU CALL IT SELFISHNESS? YES, OF COURSE, ON THE PREMISE THAT, IF THIS BE TREASON, MAKE THE MOST OF IT. ( laughing ) MM? LET'S MAKE THAT COFFEE. ...A PAINTER SHOULD BE MORE INTERESTED IN ARCHITECTURE INSTEAD OF LANDSCAPE? CAN YOU GROW HYACINTHS IN NEW YORK? Ayn: NO, NATURE IS WONDERFUL... PEOPLE SEEM ABLE TO DO ANYTHING HERE. Ayn: BUT WHAT CAN APPROACH THE EXULTATION OF OBSERVING SOME OF MAN'S GREATEST WORK, HIS SKYSCRAPERS, FOR EXAMPLE, THE RAILWAY... YOU HAVE A GIFT, FRANK. YOU SHOULD USE IT. A GIFT FOR FLOWERS AND PAINTING. NOT MUCH LIKE HOWARD ROARK, IS IT? Ayn: ...PHYSICAL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SURROUND US. ♪♪♪♪ Man: BUT, AYN, YOU'VE SAID THAT BANKS ARE NOT TO BE CHARTERED. WHY NOT? IT SEEMS PERFECTLY REASONABLE. ♪♪♪♪ ( typewriter clacking ) Ayn: I AM THE MAN WHO DOES NOT SACRIFICE HIS LOVE OR HIS VALUES.

I AM THE MAN WHO WILL NOW TELL YOU... I-I AM THE MAN WHO WILL NOW TELL YOU... Ayn: NATHAN? FRANK INSISTS I TAKE A BREAK FROM WORK. HE WANTS TO LOOK AT BARE TREES AND SNOW. YOU CAN'T GIVE UP. IT'S TOO IMPORTANT. TO WHOM? TO EVERYONE. I DON'T CARE ABOUT EVERYONE. WELL, THEN, TO ME. Barbara: NATHAN? COME ON! GIVE IT A TRY! OH, DON'T BE ABSURD. SOMETIMES I-I THINK I'M NEVER GOING TO FINISH THIS BOOK. YOU CAN'T THINK LIKE THAT, YOU CAN'T. AYN, I REFUSE TO SIT HERE AND LET ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINKERS OF OUR TIME PRETEND THAT-- WHAT? OH... WHAT IS IT? SO WONDERFULLY YOUNG. OH, DON'T CONDESCEND TO ME, PLEASE. NO, DEAR NATHAN, I AM NOT DOING THAT. I-I KNOW WHAT IT IS TO DOUBT MYSELF. BUT YOU HAVE NO REASON TO. I DO. WHAT-- WHAT HAVE I DONE? WHAT HAVE I DONE, ARGUE WITH MY TEACHERS? ANYONE CAN DO THAT. WHAT DOES THAT AMOUNT TO, COMPARED TO YOU? NATHAN, YOU ARE A GENIUS. I KNEW THIS THE FIRST TIME I MET YOU, AND I DO NOT PASS THIS JUDGMENT LIGHTLY. YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON WHO SEES THE BEST IN ME. NO. NO. NOT THE ONLY. THE FIRST. JUST THE FIRST TO KNOW YOU. ♪♪♪♪ ( honks ) I THINK YOU KNOW WE ALL HAD A WONDERFUL TIME LAST WEEK, AND IF YOU DON'T MIND, IDEALLY, WE'D LIKE TO MAKE IT A ONCE-A-WEEK EVENT, MEETING AND TALKING. YES.

I RESPECT-- I SAW YOU! WHAT DID YOU SEE? I TALKED TO HER, IS THAT IT? YOU SAW HER GIVING ME SUPPORT. MY GOD, IF WE CAN'T EXPECT THAT FROM AYN, WHAT ARE WE DEVOTING OURSELVES TO?

WELL, THAT'S A GOOD SIGN. UM, UH, MEDICALLY SPEAKING. WHAT'S THE QUESTION? PERIPATETIC. IT'S GREEK. IT MEANS TO WALK AROUND. ARISTOTLE FOUNDED THE PERIPATETIC SCHOOL. THEY WALKED AROUND ATHENS DISCUSSING RHETORIC, ETHICS, THE NATURE OF REALITY. UH-HUH. SO, WOULD THAT FLY IN MANHATTAN? ♪♪♪♪ ( chuckles ) ( chatter ) SHE FLED COMMUNIST RUSSIA IN 1926, BLEW UP HOUSING FOR THE POOR IN 1943 IN A NOVEL, AND NOW SHE'S TELLING US WHAT'S WRONG WITH AMERICA IN 1957, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH HER. AYN RAND. ATLAS SHRUGGED. A BIG BOOK. A BIG THEME. WHAT'S IT ABOUT? SIMPLY PUT, THE MIND ON STRIKE. WHOSE MIND? THE MINDS THAT MATTER. SCIENTISTS, INVENTORS, ARTISTS, INDUSTRIALISTS, THE MOTORS THAT RUNS THE WORLD. I SHOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THAT MOTOR STOPS. AND WHAT'S THAT? CHAOS, BOTH SPIRITUAL AND PHYSICAL. IS THAT A SURPRISE? IT IS TO A WORLD THAT ENSLAVES THEM. ENSLAVES INDUSTRIALISTS. HOW? BY A MORALITY THAT REQUIRES A MAN'S EFFORTS BENEFIT EVERYONE BUT HIMSELF. MM. YOU'VE BEEN CALLED A FASCIST. I ABHOR FASCISM. I ABHOR THE USE OF FORCE. WHAT DO YOU LOVE? REASON. HEROISM. THE LUMINOUS POTENTIAL OF MAN. "EXECRABLE CLAPTRAP." I BEG YOUR PARDON? THE REVIEWS. "OUTPOURING OF HATE," "LONGER THAN LIFE AND TWICE AS PREPOSTEROUS," "CRACK-BRAINED..." THEY GO ON AND ON. "APPLAUDS THE DESTRUCTION OF THE WEAK TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE STRONG." "RAND IS ARGUING FOR A DICTATORSHIP." NO, I AM FIGHTING A DICTATORSHIP, A DICTATORSHIP OF SELF-SACRIFICE, OF COLLECTIVISM-- YOU SEEM TO HAVE A LOT OF ENEMIES. IN THE WORLD THE WAY IT IS TODAY, THAT IS A COMPLIMENT. TWELVE YEARS, FRANK. I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO... NEVER AGAIN. I DON'T HAVE IT IN ME. I GAVE MY LIFE TO THIS BOOK... AND I ACHIEVED SOMETHING NEW. I ACHIEVED... AND SO BOOKS ARE PRINTED AND CRITICS TELL THEIR LIES. AND NO ONE SPEAKS OUT TO DEFEND ME, NO ONE. NO ONE, NOT TO EVEN SAY I EXIST. AS IF I WAS INVISIBLE. NATHANIEL'S HERE NOW. ( sobs ) SORRY I'M LATE. MY SESSION RAN OVER. HOW DO YOU FEEL TODAY? OH, MY BACK, MY SHOULDERS... COME HERE. WHEN DID WE LAST MAKE LOVE, NATHAN? WOULD YOU LIKE TO NOW? ( chuckles ) YOU GOT ANOTHER DELIVERY OF FAN MAIL. THAT'S LIKE OVER 2,000 LETTERS THIS WEEK. I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN CAPITALIZE ON IT, AND I'D LIKE TO TRY SOMETHING, IF IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH YOU. NOW YOU-- YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO DO A THING. JUST GIVE ME YOUR BLESSING. WE DO NOT GRANT TO ANYONE-- THE STATE, THE COLLECTIVE, AN ELITE, THE MASSES, THE NEEDY, THE SUCCESSFUL, THE WHOLE POPULATION OF THE EARTH-- OWNERSHIP OVER OUR LIVES. IF YOU GAVE FOUR PEOPLE THE ASSIGNMENT TO SOLVE A CERTAIN PROBLEM, YOU PROBABLY WOULD FIND THEY TRY TO DO SO IN VASTLY DIFFERENT WAYS... ( applause ) OUR LIVES BELONG TO US, TO EACH MAN AND EACH WOMAN INDIVIDUALLY, TO BE LIVED AS REASON DIRECTS IN SERVICE OF OUR OWN HAPPINESS. I'LL TAKE QUESTIONS NOW, UNLESS... MRS. BRANDEN, I ENJOYED YOUR LECTURE SO MUCH, I THINK I'LL JOIN YOU. ( murmurs, applause ) Man: EXCUSE ME, MISS RAND, I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD GIVE US THE ESSENCE OF YOUR PHILOSOPHY STANDING ON ONE LEG. GO ON WITH YA! SIT DOWN! ( murmurs ) METAPHYSICS: OBJECTIVE REALITY. EPISTEMOLOGY: REASON. ETHICS: SELF-INTEREST. POLITICS: CAPITALISM. ( chuckling ) THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, MISS RAND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT WAS A FASCINATING LECTURE. THANK YOU. I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD TELL ME WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A PERSON DOESN'T SPEAK ENGLISH. IF THEY'RE DISCUSSING MATTERS OF LOVE, LET'S SAY, HOW DO THEY KNOW WHAT THE OTHER IS SAYING... IF THEY DON'T ACTUALLY SPEAK ENGLISH? HOW CAN THEY COMMUNICATE? WHAT DO THEY DO THEN? IF-- IF THE SOLVER... MY APARTMENT. THANK YOU. MY BOOKCASE. MY CLOSET. MY LAMP. MY TELEVISION. MY FIREPLACE. MY RECORD PLAYER. ( trumpet-led jazz playing ) CAN YOU DANCE TO THIS? UNLESS YOU'RE AMISH. THIS IS, UM... IT'S VERY PERIPATETIC. I CAN'T STAY. IT'S ALL RIGHT. SPOKE TO THE PUBLISHER TODAY. THEY'RE STARTING THEIR FOURTH PRINTING. THE BOOK IS FLYING OFF THE SHELVES. NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT, ESPECIALLY AFTER THOSE REVIEWS. HAVE YOU TOLD AYN? SHE WON'T LISTEN. SHE KEEPS SAYING WE'RE IN THE LAST DAYS OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. ( chuckles ) LISTEN TO THIS ONE. "DEAR MISS RAND. "LAST NIGHT, I FINISHED YOUR BOOK. THIS MORNING, I ANNOUNCED MY RESIGNATION FROM RABBINICAL COLLEGE." ( chuckles ) ( shivers ) I WANT TO DISCUSS SOMETHING. UH-HUH? YOU ONCE ASKED MY PERMISSION TO CHANGE A RELATIONSHIP. I GAVE IT. I ACCEPTED THAT IT WAS NECESSARY, MAYBE INEVITABLE. NOW, I'D LIKE YOU TO DO THE SAME FOR ME. WITH WHO? RICHARD FOLGER. YOU'RE JOKING. NO. THE NOTION'S ABSURD. I DIDN'T ASK YOUR OPINION. I ASKED YOUR CONSENT. MY CONSENT? THAT'S RIDICULOUS. WHY BOTHER? BECAUSE IF ANYTHING'S LEFT BETWEEN US, I HOPED IT MIGHT BE HONESTY. WELL, THEN, HONESTLY, LET'S RE-EXAMINE YOUR PERPETUAL NEED TO DEGRADE YOURSELF... THAT IS-- AND ME. DO YOU EVER THINK ABOUT THAT? MORE THAN YOU KNOW. OH. I SEE. I SEE. IT'S MY FAULT YOU HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY. BARBARA, CAN'T YOU SEE YOU ARE STILL RETREATING? IF WE WERE DISCUSSING SOMEONE EVEN CLOSE TO AN INTELLECTUAL EQUAL-- LIKE CAROLINE. IS SHE SMARTER WITH HER CLOTHES OFF? AND NOW WE ADD PARANOIA TO OUR REPERTOIRE. YOU'RE ATTRACTED TO HER, AREN'T YOU? I AM TEACHING HER. BARBARA, I KNOW WE'RE ALL IN A DIFFICULT SITUATION. I CAN'T STOP YOU FROM DOING WHAT YOU WANT TO DO. BUT I CAN'T GIVE MY CONSENT. NOT TO SOMETHING THAT MOCKS EVERYTHING WE'VE DEVOTED OURSELVES TO. DID YOU SAY ANYTHING ABOUT CAROLINE TO AYN? THAT WAS A GOOD MEAL. YEAH. LITTLE SPICY MAYBE, BUT... YOU GONNA COME UP? Hooker: HEY, RICHARD. WEST 25th. YOU KNOW, BARBARA, I THOUGHT, UM... I DON'T KNOW. WE COULD BE HAPPY TOGETHER. IT'S NOT THAT HARD. RIGHT, BUT YOU DON'T THINK THAT MATTERS, HUH? IT MATTERS. THEN WHY ARE WE DOING THIS? GOOD EVENING. YOU KNOW THOSE BOOKS? I LIKED THEM. THEY WERE GOOD STORIES. AND IT'D BE NICE TO KNOW YOU WERE A GENIUS... YOU DIDN'T OWE ANYTHING TO ANYBODY. YOU'D ALWAYS EXPLAIN YOURSELF TO YOURSELF, ALWAYS BE RIGHT, BUT LIFE'S NOT LIKE THAT. IT COULD BE. ♪♪♪♪ ( honking ) I HOPE IT IS. FOR YOU. ( sighs ) GOOD NIGHT. 'NIGHT. IT'S ABOUT TIME WE TOLD HER. I CAN'T JEOPARDIZE THE INSTITUTE RIGHT NOW. IT'S MINE, MY NAME. I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW AYN WOULD TAKE IT. SHE, UH... BROUGHT BARBARA AND I TOGETHER. WE'RE KIND OF LIVING PROOF OF HER WORK. SHE... SHE CAN BE VERY EASILY UPSET. WHAT AM I TO YOU, NATHAN? ♪♪♪♪ WELL, I WOULD SAY YOU'RE MY WORST STUDENT. YOU'RE ASHAMED OF ME. YOU'RE ABOUT THE ONLY THING THAT I'M NOT ASHAMED OF. I love you. I just wish we could tell her. I KNOW. I WISH WE COULD TOO. ♪♪♪♪ IN 1951, I SWORE I WOULD NEVER AGAIN RETURN TO LOS ANGELES. I CONSIDERED IT A SWAMP OF MORAL EQUIVOCATION AND OF MINDLESSNESS. ( laughing ) HAPPILY, THERE HAS BEEN SOME KIND OF PROGRESS IN THE LAST 13 YEARS. BUT-- BUT NOT IN OTHER PLACES. "ASK NOT WHAT YOUR COUNTRY CAN DO FOR YOU, BUT WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR YOUR COUNTRY." SO SAID OUR LATE PRESIDENT. BUT THAT SENTIMENT WAS POPULAR IN ANOTHER COUNTRY AT ANOTHER TIME. NAZI GERMANY, 1933. THE DEMAND IS THE SAME, WHETHER IT IS CALLED THE THIRD REICH OR THE NEW FRONTIER. THE INDIVIDUAL MUST SACRIFICE HIMSELF TO THE STATE. JACK KENNEDY WAS NOT ADOLF HITLER. YOU DON'T CARE IF THE POOR STARVE. AYN, TELL THEM. TELL THEM THAT FREE ENTERPRISE CREATES JOBS. IT'S STATISM THAT STARVES EVERYONE. THAT IS NOT TRUE. THERE'S GOTTA BE SOMEBODY-- YOU'RE PREACHING SELFISHNESS. THAT'S ALL IT IS. THIS COUNTRY TOOK YOU IN AND GAVE YOU REFUGE. DON'T YOU FEEL YOU OWE IT ANYTHING? YES, OF COURSE I DO, AND I HAVE GIVEN IT. I HAVE GIVEN IT EVERYTHING I HAVE-- MY WORK, MY BOOKS, MY LIFE. SO DID KARL MARX. WHAT HE DID FOR COMMUNISM, I DO FOR CAPITALISM. WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT AFTERWARDS. GOOD. NOW-- NOW WE ARE BEGINNING A DISCUSSION. SO. MORE DISCUSSION. YOU SEE THE AUDIENCES YOU'RE CAPABLE OF DRAWING? MAYBE THEY THINK I'M DIETRICH. THERE'S AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN HEARING YOUR IDEAS, DESPITE WHAT THE PRESS SAYS. THESE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR SOME DIRECTION. IF WE CAN MARSHAL THEM SOMEHOW-- WHAT? TO BE BACK IN CALIFORNIA, AFTER SO MUCH TIME, WITH NATHANIEL... AND STILL, HE IS SO YOUNG. ( chuckles ) I'M NOT... NOT THAT YOUNG ANYMORE. WAITER? I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU. OH, I WANTED TO DISCUSS THE POSSIBILITY OF THE INSTITUTE PRINTING SOME OF YOUR EARLY STORIES. I'M STARTING A PUBLISHING DIVISION. SO MUCH BUSINESS. WELL, YES. YES, I DON'T WANT TO LOSE AN OPPORTUNITY, NOT WHEN PEOPLE'S MINDS ARE FINALLY-- I'VE MISSED YOU. I HAVEN'T GONE ANYWHERE. I WONDER. I FEEL AS IF I'M WAKING UP FROM A LONG SLEEP. I DON'T THINK THINGS ARE THE SAME BETWEEN US. I THINK ABOUT YOU EVERY DAY. AS A COLLEAGUE? NO. AS A TEACHER? AN OLD WOMAN? I THINK OF US IN BED TOGETHER. I THINK OF MAKING LOVE WITH YOU. AYN, PLEASE UNDERSTAND. I FEEL ABOUT YOU THE WAY I ALWAYS HAVE. WHAT IS THE PROBLEM? ( chuckles ) BARBARA. I THOUGHT SHE COULD CHANGE, BUT... THE MARRIAGE IS FALLING APART, AND IT'S DRAINING EVERYTHING OUT OF ME. AND YOU DON'T TELL ME THIS? I DIDN'T WANT TO BURDEN YOU. NATHAN, I LOVE YOU. I WANT TO HELP YOU IN YOUR TROUBLE, HELP YOU TO FREE YOURSELF. I-I DON'T THINK THAT'S POSSIBLE. OF COURSE IT IS POSSIBLE. JUST-- DON'T HIDE FROM ME. MISS RAND? I'M JUST GETTING OFF SHIFT, UM... SO SORRY TO BOTHER YOU. I HAVE TO TELL YOU, YOUR BOOK'S CHANGED MY LIFE. I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD SIGN. YOU HAVE PEN? UH... HERE. THANK YOU. COULD WE ORDER? NATHAN, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, I GIVE NO ONE THE POWER TO HURT ME. NO, NO, NO. TODAY. SORRY. JANET, SEND OUT THOSE MINUTES? NO, I'LL GET RIGHT ON IT. ( phone ringing ) THIS IS THE NATHANIEL BRANDEN INSTITUTE. ( chuckles ) YES. NO, THIS IS THE BRANDEN INSTITUTE. NO, SIR, THIS IS NOT A FARM-STYLE DANCING SCHOOL. ( mouths ) NO, I'M SORRY, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT-- THANKS. BYE. HELLO. UCLA? THIS IS CAROLINE KELLY. I'M CALLING ON BEHALF OF THE NATHANIEL BRANDEN INSTITUTE. YOU'D EXPRESSED INTEREST IN A SERIES OF LECTURES? MM-HMM. YES. YES, HE'S WONDERFUL. UM, SO, WHEN DO YOU THINK YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE HIM COME AND LECTURE FOR YOU? HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN SLEEPING WITH HER? A LONG TIME. AND YOU TELL ME NOW? I'M SICK OF HEARING MYSELF LIE. YOU CALLED RICHARD AN... UNACCEPTABLE COMPROMISE OF MY PRINCIPLES. WHAT ARE YOUR PRINCIPLES, NATHAN? DO YOU HAVE ANY? ( sighs ) WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO? ( sighs ) FIND ANOTHER APARTMENT. CONTACT A LAWYER. GET A DIVORCE. WHY DID WE MARRY, NATHAN? DO YOU REMEMBER? A VISION OF... SOMETHING HEROIC. WOULDN'T THAT HAVE BEEN NICE. Frank: HELLO, BARBARA. COME ON IN. ( door closes; Ayn yelling ) SHE'S IN HER OFFICE THERE. IT'S ICARUS. YOU CAN SEE THE WINGS HERE. AND HE'S-- HE'S JUST PLUNGED STRAIGHT THROUGH THE-- THE-- UM-- THE LIGHT. Ayn: YOU WILL NEVER AGAIN PUBLISH A BOOK OF MINE. UH, THE YELLOW LIGHT. THE SUN. ( receiver slams ) YEAH, BUT IT'S OKAY. HE'S ALL RIGHT, YOU SEE. HE'S COME THROUGH ALL RIGHT. BARBARA! OH, BARBARA! AND HE'S GONNA BE OKAY. THANK GOODNESS YOU CALLED. YOU ARE THE ONLY SANE PERSON I CAN TALK TO. IT'S NATHAN. I DON'T-- I DON'T UNDERSTAND HIM ANYMORE. HE'S BEING SO DIFFICULT. I MEAN, HE SAYS HE CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT ME, BUT THEN THE NEXT DAY, I-- OH... I DON'T KNOW. YOU THINK BECAUSE HE DOESN'T BREAK IT OFF WITH ME, HE STILL LOVES ME? IS THAT POSSIBLE? CAN WE GO AND TALK PRIVATELY? Nathaniel: SUPPOSE A MAN WHO PASSIONATELY LOVES HIS WIFE AND IS SPENDING A FORTUNE TO CURE HER OF A DANGEROUS ILLNESS IS ASKED TO LET HER DIE IN ORDER TO SPEND THAT MONEY TO SAVE TEN OTHER WOMEN. THAT WOULD BE A SELFLESS SACRIFICE, AND THAT'S THE CLEAREST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OBJECTIVISM AND ALTRUISM. Miss Rand would like to see you immediately. EXCUSE ME. ( murmuring ) ( doorbell buzzing ) ( door opens ) NO, NOT IN MY LIVING ROOM. SIT THERE. DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'VE DONE? DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'VE THROWN AWAY? ME. WITHOUT ME, YOU'RE NOTHING! NOTHING! IT WAS MY LIFE, MY WORK, MY MIND! AND YOU REJECT ME, THE WOMAN YOU SAID YOU COULDN'T LIVE WITHOUT, YOUR HIGHEST VALUE, YOU SAID. I GAVE YOU MY LOVE. I GAVE YOU MY NAME. I OFFERED YOU THE WORLD! I'M SORRY, BUT I LOVE HER. YOU ROTTEN HYPOCRITE, YOU LYING, CORRUPT MEDIOCRITY! YOU-- YOU SHOULD HAVE LOVED ME, GODDAMN YOU! GODDAMN YOU! GODDAMN YOU! GET OUT. GOOD-BYE, AYN. I'M VERY TIRED. AYN... NO, I'LL, UH... I'LL DECIDE LATER. DO YOU NEED ME? I DON'T NEED ANYONE. ( door opens, closes ) ( chatter ) ( shushing ) I'VE TAKEN ACTIONS THAT I KNOW TO BE WRONG. I HAVE FAILED TO PRACTICE THE PRINCIPLES THAT I TEACH. AYN RAND GAVE ME FREE USE OF HER WORK AND HER NAME, AND I HAVE DEFAULTED ON THAT TRUST. MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MISS RAND... HAS BEEN SEVERED, AS IS HER MORAL RIGHT. WHAT DOES HE MEAN? I DON'T KNOW. WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT? I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON. THIS BREAK SHOULD IN NO WAY AFFECT YOUR SUPPORT OF OBJECTIVISM, A PHILOSOPHY SHOULD NOT BE JUDGED BY THE BEHAVIOR OF ITS TEACHERS. I... I HEREBY RESIGN FROM THE INSTITUTE AND ALL ITS OPERATIONS.

AYN, FOR THE INSTITUTE TO CONTINUE, WE HAVE TO-- NOTHING WITH THAT HYPOCRITE'S NAME WILL BE ALLOWED TO EXIST. HE WILL BE STRIPPED OF EVERYTHING HE HAS TAKEN. HE WILL BE EXPOSED AND HUMILIATED. THEN LET HIM WANDER THE WORLD AS THE NONENTITY HE IS. HE'S WRITING A BOOK, AN OBJECTIVIST PERSPECTIVE ON PSYCHOLOGY. A PLAGIARISM OF ME, ISN'T IT? NEW AMERICAN LIBRARY WANTS IT. HE WILL NEVER BE PUBLISHED! I WILL BREAK HIS CONTRACT. HE WILL VANISH! THIEF BASTARD! SPINELESS... STOP IT! STOP IT! YOU CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS. HE'S LOST HIS FRIENDS. HE'S LOST HIS WORK. IT'S PUNISHMENT ENOUGH, AYN. DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING? I'M ASKING YOU TO SHOW COMPASSION. WHY? IT'S WHAT HUMANS DO. FRANK. TELL THEM, PLEASE? BARBARA. I DON'T UNDERSTAND A WORD OF IT. NEVER DID. BARBARA, BARBARA, BARBARA. YOU ARE FALLING INTO ERROR. NO. THEN YOU HAVE PASSED INTO CORRUPTION. IT ISN'T RIGHT TO DESTROY HIM. YOU KNOW THAT. YOU ALL DO. AND SO... YOU DISAPPOINT ME. YES.
