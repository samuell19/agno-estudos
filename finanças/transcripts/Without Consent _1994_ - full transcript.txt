[upbeat music] [Man laughs] Come here. [Man] Mmm. [woman pants] You're so pretty. [music playing on car] [Michelle] Unbelievable. How many times I've... I wasn't trying to embarrass you. I was just giving you a clue. [Robert] I felt like an idiot in front of everyone. How am I supposed to know who wrote "The Stranger"? But nobody cares that you didn't know the answer. [Robert] I don't know why do we play that stupid game every time we go to their house, anyway. It gives Vince a chance to waive his college degree in my face. Could've at least have stayed for dessert. ♪ Something a little more than time to kill ♪ ♪ There's no mistaking the laws that we're breaking ♪ ♪ We'll do what we always do ♪ [man chuckling] Hey... you scared the hell outta me. Laura, I wanna see you in the other room. [sighs] [Laura sighs] Get dressed and get out of here. [Laura] Dad! [Laura sighs] We weren't doing anything. How much have you had to drink? A little. I told you I never wanted to see him here again. You completely disobeyed me. You never got mad when I was with Danny. Is it that you don't like Eric? Because-- Danny would never have been in there like that. Oh, you just never caught us. This is not about which boyfriend we like better. This is about trusting you when we're away. You're grounded for two weeks for this. -Mother, what--? -[Robert] Go to bed! Sleep it off! [Laura sighs] This is getting out of hand. I'm too tired to get into this now. I'm going to bed. Right. Are you coming? In a while. [birds chirping] Well, I'd promised to be harder, Steve when business picks up, but on what if business doesn't pick up. Have you seen my briefcase? Oh, here it is. Listen Laura, some stupid stuff like the one you pulled last night, have got to stop, do you understand me? You know how critical your senior year is to getting into the right college. Now we have four weeks to send in those letters of recommendation. You're on top of those, right? Yes. I'm not gonna do all this by myself you know. Tonight we work on Northwestern's and Wisconsin's, I'm counting on you young lady. [sighs] Maybe we all hold onto them until the end of the month. Maybe things will pick up. I'm showing a house at 5:30 but I should be home in time to make dinner. I'm going to work. This time I promise. I'll see you later. Uh-huh God, I'm late. So am I. Don't forget your lunch. I'll just grab something at school. Try not to make it french fries. [sighs] [bell rings] [chattering] [Man] Laura, can I speak to you? You didn't turn in yesterday's assignments. You flunked the midterm, Laura. I don't know if I can let you make it up. I mean, you're so far behind. I understand. I don't. You were one of the top students in my class last year. Look, I know what your brother went through and I just don't wanna see you start down the same path. I'm just burnt out, that's all. I've talked to Mr. Carlson about this. I'm required to tell him when things slide this far, you know the policy. Yeah, whatever. I'm late for calculus. [chattering] [Boy] Hey you. [Eric] You spilled. You okay? You ever wonder what would be like to be somebody else? Someone else. What do you mean? Somebody else, somebody different, different family, different schools, different looks. Everything. I don't get it, how could you be someone else? Forget it. No, you gotta give it a rest Laura. You've been talking crazy lately. Really. Well, maybe I'm crazy. Hey, isn't that dad over there? [Eric] Don't tell me it's his cousin, right? -Get outta here. -[Eric chuckles] [door opens] [Michelle on answering machine] Hi, it looks like I'm not gonna make it home after all. I know, don't say it. Hmm-- The Northwestern application is in my desk, why don't you get started I'll arrive after dinner... [Robert] Laura? Is that you? [Michelle on answering machine] ...lamb chops are defrosting. -Yeah? -[answering machine beeps] [Robert] Come in here, we need to talk. So is there something you wanna tell me? No. Why? Well, I got a call from your guidance counselor, Mr. Carlson? He says you're barely passing any of your classes, you've been ditching school. He wants to see your mother and me Wednesday afternoon. I-- Dad, don't worry. I'm not gonna flunk any of my classes. This is exactly how David started. First its the grades, then its the--- Dad, I'm not stealing things or doing drugs, why don't you just lay off? We have a serious, serious problem here, Laura. What are we gonna do about it? Nothing, just don't worry. Don't worry. Well, that's just great. You tell that to your mother. She's only been helping you fill out applications for college for the last month. I never asked her to help me fill out those applications [sighs] Laura! Hey, Laura, get back here! [chattering and music from inside] [Laura] I couldn't really get you that much because mom didn't have time to go to the store and I was doing some stuff, not like lying on the couch. Cool, I could use those, thanks. How things in squirrel cage? Don't ask, I feel like I can't breathe in that house. [David] What's up? I just can't wait to get out of there. All mom talks about is, what college am I gonna go to. She makes such a big deal about me being first and the family to go. I guess I kind of left that on you, didn't I ? Yeah, I think. If I hear mom saying she's counting on me one more time, I think I'm gonna explode. I should be so lucky. What do you mean? Mom never said anything like that to me. When I was about 13, I guess, Bill Turner and I broke into dad's liquor cabinet after school. We drank a whole bottle of his bourbon, it was the first time I ever drank. I was so wasted. [chuckles] Mom came home early and busted us. And after she sent Bill home, she came up to my room with this really serious look on her face. I was pretty scared. And she said, "David... I always knew you were gonna be the loser in this family. I don't think she meant it. Oh yeah, she did. [clattering] And that wasn't the last time I heard that from her either. And after that, and I don't know, I just started getting in trouble a lot. Nothing seemed to matter anymore. But hey, getting outta that house was the best thing I ever did. Now that I got a job and everything, I'm gonna get my own place. That's what you said last time. This time I'm serious. Besides, Stuart said I can only stay in the back of the shop till the end of the month. Guess I'm running out of friends to hit up. Or you can always come back home. Yeah. Right that'll be the day. Yeah. I guess this is not a very good idea. Real bad idea. [sighs] [door closes] -[Michelle] Where have you been? -Out Out where? You're grounded? You saw David, didn't you? Ah-- He's my brother, I'm allowed to see him, aren't I? How are you planning to get into college without finishing high school first? I plan on finishing high school. Not with F's and all your classes. I'm not getting F's in all my classes. Don't lie to me! What the hell has gotten into you? Do you wanna end up like your brother? Do you wanna throw your life away? He hasn't thrown his life away. He's got a good job now. Right, washing dishes? You're such a snob. Listen to me. Is that what you want? Because that is exactly how you're gonna end up if you don't get into a decent college. Maybe I won't go to college next fall. Maybe I won't go to college at all. [Michelle sighs] You don't even know what you're saying. Go to bed. We'll talk about this in the morning. [sighs hard] [Counselor] Has she been moody, secretive, depressed lately, hanging out with different friends? Yes. All of those things. Just to say, we're very concerned. Well, I know that we discussed this option when you were having problems with David and I understood your reluctance then but a residential treatment facility, such as Meadowbrook has been having terrific success in dealing with these types of behavior disorders. You might want to reconsider getting some professional help this time. I have to tell you, I feel very uncomfortable about this. I still like to think that we could handle any problems ourselves. I understand, but I do have to be honest with you. I've seen these types of sudden behavior changes in kids and oftentimes it's a cry for help. If that cry goes unheard, it could lead to self destructive behavior. Nowadays with teen suicides at epidemic proportions, I just think we all have to look closer at these types of warning signs. [dramatic music] Robert come up here now! Where'd you find those? In her desk. Well what were you doing in her desk? Looking for something, drugs, anything answers. -Well it's only a poem... -[Michelle] Read it. [reading] Feeling so small, but I know it'd be better for everyone. If I just wasn't here at all. Just a poem huh? [Michelle sighs heavy] Well, she couldn't really be talking about suicide. [door closes] I'm going to talk to her. [footsteps approaching] Hi. How was school? Fine. Can we talk for a minute? Sure. I know we've had our problems lately but I want you to know that you can always come and talk to me about anything. No matter how bad it is. Yeah. I know that. I know breaking up with Danny was tough on you and sometimes it's good to talk about that stuff. Eh-- If you feel like talking about it and you can. [smiles nervously] I would like it if you did. I remember when I broke up with this guy in high school, Dev Warner. I thought I was gonna die. I'm fine. I really don't need to talk about it. Are you sure? Yeah. Well... I just wanted you to know that I'm always here for you. I'm not gonna do my homework. I'm grounded, remember? Michelle, look at this. What is it? It says here that Laura never took the SAT's? What? No, this is a mistake. I'll call the school. [Michelle sighs heavy] Mom, what are you doing? When were you planning to tell us about the SATs? Eh-- I was gonna tell you-- No. no more excuses, no more explanations. I don't wanna see you now, I don't wanna hear your voice. Okay. I'm just gonna go-- I don't care where you're going. I don't know if I can ever forgive you for this. [defiant music] [car starts] [car skids] [TV on] [Laura] I can't believe how stupid I am. I've never seen her like that. Uh-huh. I can't go home. My roommate is not coming home until Thursday so you can stay here. It's late. Let's go to bed. Well, why don't I sleep on the couch. What's wrong? [chuckles] I just told you that I can't go home. Uh-huh. And my life is totally messed up. Look, I just need a friend right now. Hey, I am your friend. I'm the best friend that you've got. Look, I said no, just leave me alone. This is the perfect opportunity. We got the whole place to ourselves. I can't believe that's all you're interested in. [sighs heavy] You never cared about me. Oh don't be so selfish. What I'm doing here. What about me? What about you? [dramatic music] [passing car honks] [tires screeching] [passing car honks] [tires screeching] [loud crash] [police radio chatter] Are you sure you all right? Dad, I told you I'm fine. Yeah, the officer said that your blood alcohol level was very high. You probably know that we've made a decision. We're gonna get you some help. We're sending you to a place called Meadowbrook. [dramatic music] [Dr. Winslow] Self esteem, life management skills, leadership qualities. These are the goals of Meadowbrook. Now we don't know yet, the extent of Laura's problem. The behavior you have seen may be the tip of the iceberg, or it may just be growing pains. But I assure you, our success rate here is impressive. Often the two week evaluation period is more than enough to take care of the problem. At Meadowbrook we really do turn lives around. [knocks] [Dr. Winslow] Yes. Thank you. Very good. Your insurance is more than adequate. [sighs heavily] [Robert] I love you, sweetheart. I can't believe you're doing this to me. I hope you understand we want what's best for you sweetie. Don't even try mom. [steps walking away] [sad music] [sighs heavily] They admitted here without even talking to her. What? They admitted her without seeing her, without a diagnosis. How could they do that? Well, what did they say to the insurance companies? It will be all right? It's just two weeks. The important thing is she's getting help. Dr Winslow, I don't know what my parents told you, but I really don't belong here. You know Laura, I think it best that the time that you are here that you try to make the most of it. Consider it a break for you and your parents. Time to sort things out. -Okay. -[Dr. Winslow] Okay. This is Ms. Collins. She'll help you settle in. -All right? -Okay. All right. [door-lock opens] [door closes loudly] [Nurse] Sit here. What's that for? It's procedure, everybody gets it. [Ms. Collins] It's just something to relax you. What are you doing with my clothes? They're inappropriate. We have a dress code here. No dresses and skirts, nothing provocative, no shorts, no makeup, no jewelry. Only long pants and shirts with the appropriate sleeve lengths are allowed. Now, why don't you get undressed and we'll finish getting you settled in. What do you mean get undressed? I mean, take your clothes off. Excuse me? Strip search, it's routine. Nothing to worry about, honest. Here. Put this off. We have five status levels here at Meadowbrook. With each level you get more privileges. You're at level one. Earn a hundred points and you move to the next level. You just earned 10 points for cooperating back there. See how easy it is? If you behave, you get privileges. Phone calls privileges, maybe even off grounds. Talking with other patients will be confined with social hour, from three to four daily. That's all. While you're here, there'll be no TV, no radio, no mail, no visitors. I think we better get a grip on napping in the middle of the day. Thank You, Ms. Collins. I will modify my behavior. Your dresser. Your bed. Now, if you follow the rules, you and I will get along just fine, okay? Group in 15 minutes. Hey. Look, I can't talk to you. Okay? Why not? Cause I don't wanna lose any points. I'm almost on level four then I get my own room. Fine, we don't have to talk. Did you get anything past them? Like what? You know, cigarettes, pot, anything ? [chuckles] You mean if I wanted to believe me, they looked everywhere. There's ways around that you'll see. [chuckles] At least you gotta little buzz going there, right? Yeah. I feel like I've been run over by a truck. You're doing the "thighs-in shuffle", that's all. Just enough to mellow you out. If you didn't have a drug problem coming in, don't worry you are going out. [CJ] And we had totally different taste in music which was like this big issue with my old man. I mean, he thought I was worshiping devil or something. He was into all this... folk music, peace and love crap. With all of his friends that wore sandals and sit far out all the time. I just couldn't take it anymore. So one day I took all of his records out and busted them up with a hammer in the garage. And how did that make you feel? Felt great. [chuckles] [Marty] Oh. [Counselor] Yes Marty. You have something you'd like to share? Well, I have a complaint to register. Fine. What is it? Well, you know that that blue water stuff they have in the toilets here? The commercial says it's supposed to last 2000 flushes. Right? Well, I've been counting. With one night it can only last 879 flushes. That's a difference of like 1,121 flushes. That's false advertising. I mean, I say there ought to be a law--- [Counselor] Thank you Marty. Keep it up. You're gonna be at level two for the rest of your life. Does anyone else have words of wisdom to offer? All right, we have a new member of our group joining us today. Stand up. You can introduce yourself to everyone by stating your name and admitting that you're an alcoholic. Alcoholic, what are you talking about? You got into a run-in with the police the other night. Crashed your car, it says right here that you'd been drinking. That's a mistake. [chuckles] I don't have a drinking problem. I don't even like the taste of alcohol. Group? Denial. Denial Denial. Denial. [CJ] You either face up or shut up. Those are the only two choices you've got. [Counselor] CJ's right. The sooner you admit that you have a problem, the sooner we can get at some of the feelings that are at the source. Eh-- I'm not gonna stand here and say that I'm an alcoholic when I'm not. Fine, your choice. Maybe you'd like to take a couple of hours and time out, to think about it. You had 20 points toward a level two Laura. This is going to cost you 10. -Wait-- -[Nurse] Come on, let's go. No, this is all a big mistake. Hey, just don't go away mad, just go away. I-- I don't even belong here. [Laura] Get your hands off me. [CJ] If I had a dollar for every time I heard that one. [Marty] You okay? They are just trying to put crap on your head, that's all. They will let you out by dinner. [chattering] [Marty] Same Meadowbrook. The food is bad but there's plenty of it. [Marty] That's just Naomi. She's weird. Yeah, I can see that. [Marty] It's her nightly routine. What's wrong with her? [Marty] I don't know. She snapped. Stopped talking a couple of weeks ago. They got all upset about it after meds. They can't handle it when you act nuts. They think she's faking it to get attention. [crashing] [Nurse] Let go of her. Leave her alone. I said let her go! [Nurse] You've got to modify your behavior. Are we getting a grip on not giving our food away? I told you I didn't give my food away. I said, are we getting a grip on not giving our food away? Yes. Ms. Collins. I will modify my behavior? I will modify my behavior. Good. When you've finished this one, you can go back to your room. [girls moaning] These places are all the same. I've been in and out of them since I was 13. What for? The usual. fought with my mom a lot. I wasn't crazy or anything, although I'm not so sure anymore. But I'm out of this place. I've been working on it for a few weeks now. There's this ventilation crate in the main room, leads out of the building. Every time I get a chance, I loosen one of the screws. Couple of more days and I'm mystery. [Nurse] Up. Face the wall. What, you think you're special? Come on, face the wall. [Rachel] And after that, I don't know. I just started throwing up after every meal Your mom's cooking must have been pretty bad, huh? I just don't want to get fat that's all. Marty, that's not level two behavior now is it? Huh? Let's try to get a grip on not making jokes in group. I'm sorry. I'll get a grip on not making jokes. Marty. Thank you. I'll modify my behavior. [Counselor] Alright, Rachel. Thank you. How about you, Laura? Do you feel like participating today? Do I have to? Well, if you wanna get some of those points back, you're gonna have to start participating. [CJ] Maybe she thinks she's too good for us. [Counselor] Is that true, Laura? No. Look at her. You can tell. I knew girls like you in school. Stuck up rich kids. Maybe she just hasn't got anything to say. Give her a couple of drinks, she'll loosen up. Laura. Let me ask you something. Why do you think you're in here? I don't know. Well, I'll tell you why, because your parents put you here. Because you're making their lives miserable, because your own life has become unmanageable. You're an embarrassment to your friends, your family, everybody around you. They may not say that to you, but believe me, it's true. I mean, it's bad enough for your parents that your brother was a loser. Now you? I don't have to take this crap. [Security] Where do you think you're going? I'm going to see Dr Winslow. Nobody sees Dr. Winslow. Believe me, if he has to come in here, you're in a lot of trouble. You can't keep me here, its against the law. Not if you're under 18, but hey, if you want to call a lawyer. Then take me to a phone. Sorry, only level two and up can use the phone. [Laura yelling] No! Let me go! No! Get off me. No... If you settle down, I won't have to sedate you, now its your choice. Go to hell! Get off me. No... [whimpering] [faintly] No... [whimpers fade] [defiant music] [chatter] [whispering] I wanna escape with you. Why would I let you do that? Because with the two of us loosening screws, it'll come off faster. All right, but you gotta be careful. They've got these security cameras everywhere. What the hell are you looking at? You gotta figure out a way to get yourself into the main room when nobody's there. Best way is to get yourself in trouble so you get put on deep clean. How do I get myself in trouble? [chuckles] [door opens] You better get a grip on not sleeping in the hall. Are you gonna answer me, huh? Or are you gonna play your usual games? [whimpering and laughing] Answer me. Hey, leave her alone. She's not gonna hurt anybody. You just got yourself two days in deep clean. [whimpering and laughing] Are you gonna answer me? [whimpering] Get up. -[Naomi whimpers] -[Nurse shushing] Come on. [Naomi whimpers louder] [Nurse] Show's over. Everybody get back to your room. Come on. [Naomi whimpers] I want you to clean the entire floor. [dramatic music] [Security man] Make sure it's done right or you doing it over. [kung-fu screams] Oh man... I love to give that cheesy weesy a kung-fu action. [chuckles] So... you keeping it together alright? Barely. You'll get the hang of it. Don't worry. -[Laura] What'd you do? -[Marty shushing] What's the big deal about talking in this place? They don't want you to make friends. They want you to rat on each other. That's how you get points. So that's total sex paranoid in this place. Like if you're talking with someone, they think you're having sex. Yeah right, that should be so lucky. [chuckles] What did you do to get deep clean? Eh... I don't know. I found some stupid white out in one of the four counselors desks. What, were you like sniffing it? Sniffing it? No, I was, eh-- I was gonna use it to paint this little house I built. What little house? This house is made up of an old meal box, I stole it from the kitchen. It's for Phoebe here. [smiles] Hey. Hi. Oh look, she's so cute. I named her after Holden Caulfield sister, you know, from catcher in the rye? Oh. You're really pretty. You're the prettiest girl here. It's not lying or anything. [Laura smiles I guess it is but I didn't mean anything by it. But I meant it not really. Well, thanks. [Marty] Do you wanna be friends? 'Cause, except for Phoebe here, I really don't have one, and... it could be our secret. We wouldn't have to talk or anything. We just know that we were there. You know like... friends do... and like eh... pen-pals or something, separated by thousands of miles. What'd you say? Yeah. I'd like to be your friend. [soft music] Wow. Hardly recognize a meal that doesn't come out of a Styrofoam container. I guess it has been a while since we showed at the dinner table together. It's so hard for me to get out of the office before seven, This looks delicious. Is it me, or does it seem too quiet in here? [both smile backwardly] Maybe we should turn on some heavy metal music upstairs and I guess feel more at home. I miss the kids. Well... I mean. I tried to call Laura today. Robert, you shouldn't have done that. You know what they said? She needs to be separated from us. I know, I couldn't help it. They said she was fine but they wouldn't let her come to the phone, so-- I just hope she's really okay. Don't do this to yourself Robert. We need to give this a chance. We have no other choice. It's only 11 more days. Yeah... But who's counting, huh? [radio chatter] [Laura] What happened to her? [Rachel] Tried to up herself. just probably cheeking her meds. You know, taking the pills back against her cheek. When the attendant leaves, she spits them out. Then she saves them up and takes them all at once. They'll pump her stomach. She'll be back here in two days. [ping-pong game on] That guy's always looking at me. [Marty] Who, CJ? Maybe he likes you. I don't think so, it's different than that. I wouldn't trust him. As far as I could drop, kick a range Rover. Who is he? Some jerk. Got here a few weeks ago. Spent the whole first week in the SR for mouthing off too much and fight with the attendant. Got him so strung out. I don't think he knew what planet he was on. But now all of a sudden it's yesterday. "Anything you say, sir," Winslow's poster boy. So what about you? What about me? Why are you in here? Why'd you do that? I don't know. [chuckles nervously] Some days, I-- Well, some days I get all wired and I feel great. I feel like I could jump out of an airplane without a parachute and just fly for days, you know? And other days... [laughs nervously] They call it bipolar. It's a... manic depressive, you know. But I'm much, much better now really. I mean, they make me take the meds here and they help a lot. So... Ha... I don't think I could ever do that to myself. What about you? Why are you in here? For being stupid. [Rachel] Come on, let's go. [Laura pants] Go, go. [suspenseful music] Go. [chair moves] [Rachel whispering] You go first. [Laura] How come you are not? -[Rachel] You. -[Laura] Okay. Rachel, it's a dead end. [Rachel] There she is. I followed her out here. She tried to escape. [panting] [Rachel] She tried to escape! [Security man] We're not gonna hurt you. [Security woman] Come on, stay right there. [Security man] Calm down, we're not gonna hurt you. Calm down! We won't hurt you! [Laura] Stay back! [Security man] Calm down! You go back to your room. [Laura panting] [panting] [Laura] No! Wait... [CJ shushing] I'm on your side. [Laura] What are you doing? [Laura panting] Shut up and listen. When you get out to the parking lot, head for the trees on your right, don't stop till you hit the road. Call a woman named Nora Fields. You get the Teen Law Office. Tell her what you've seen in here. Everything. You got that? Yeah, yeah. Nora Fields, right. [CJ] Come on. [Laura] Wait, wait, what about the doors? Just leave that to me. [Emergency bell rings] [CJ] Go, Go! [grunts] David, hi, its me. Now I know it's early. I'm sorry. But I need you to come pick me up. Eh-- It's a long story. I'll tell you when you get here. You sure you wanna do this? You can always stay with me you know. No, everybody's looking for me. I just want it all to be over. Hey, I'll call you later. Bye. Mum? Dad? [Michelle] Baby. You wouldn't believe the terrible things-- [Robert] Laura? They strapped us in chairs and they... put straight jackets on us and they drugged us. What's wrong. [Dr. Winslow] She won't participate in group sessions. She disobeys all the rules. She takes no interest in her own recovery. I can't believe that's Laura. Needless to say, the two week evaluation period was a bit optimistic. We suggest that her stay be extended by at least a month. A month? I-- I don't know. Mr. Mills, your daughter's behavior has become volatile. She's a danger to herself. She's a danger to others. She requires 24-hour supervision. Are you prepared to watch her for that long? Unless you say to me that you know what is best for your daughter, then I'll-- No. She'll be safer there. How do we get her to understand... that she needs this help? Let me talk to her. [steps walking away] [Laura] You're not taking me back there. Laura, the way I see it you have two choices. You either come back to Meadowbrook, without making a scene... or I call child services and you go straight to a juvenile detention center. And if you were uncomfortable at Meadowbrook, believe me... this is it, choice is yours. [door opens] I don't understand why you're doing this to me. Everything I told you was true. Hey. Call a woman named Nora, the Teen Law Office, she'll tell you everything. You're making the right decision. Yeah. [engine revs] [van door closes] [sad music] I'm going to work. [defiant music] Wait a second, you're not putting me in those. You ran away, you're going to be strapped. No, let go of me! No! No! No! You can't do this, let me out. You better regulate your moods Laura. No! Get that away from me. You'll feel better in a few minutes. [panting] [sighs hard] You all right? I couldn't sleep. I feel like Judas. Don't think like that, we did what we had to. What if she's telling the truth about what goes on in there. You really think kids are being drugged and strapped to chairs? What if it isn't helping, what if it's making her worse. It has to work. It has to. Otherwise we have lost everything that we've ever planned for her, her whole future. All of her dreams gone. When did we ever ask her what her dreams were? [Dr. Winslow] Laura? Laura? Hello Laura. How are we doing? I'm strapped to my bed, how do you think I'm doing? Please, Laura, it doesn't have to be this difficult. You don't have to fight. Then let me out and I won't. It doesn't work that way. You first have to acknowledge that you have problems and that you need our help. I don't need your help. [panting] Just let me out! You give us no choice but to continue this course of treatment Dr. Winslow, this patient has had over 30 milligrams of Cyclizine in the last 24 hours. All right. Let her rest. [grunting] [rapid door knocks] Hi. Listen. I know I'm not supposed to be here, but... I just came by to see how Laura was doing. Alright? She's not here. Oh yeah. Where'd she go? You sent her back there, didn't you? I can't believe you, how could you do that to her? We were afraid she was gonna kill herself. We had no other choice. What are you babbling about? Laura would never kill herself. What are you doing here, David? I told you not to set foot in this house until you'd paid back-- Don't worry, you don't have to lock up the silverware, I'm leaving. I just came by to see my sister. Leave Laura alone. I don't want you around her. You've done enough. Ooh, really? Hey, I hear the mom of the year award is coming up. Maybe Laura and I will nominate you. Don't look at him. He never gets his hands dirty. He's the man of stone-- All right David. [David] Aren't you pops. You can leave now. If you think Laura's just going to waltz back in here and forgive you for what you've done, you're both insane. And you wonder why you're not welcome in this house. Oh you make sure to remind me every chance you get. [bangs door] Hi. Eh-- I was just nowhere near your neighborhood. And thought I stop in for a cup of coffee. [laughs backwardly] Are you okay? [Marty shushing] Come on, don't cry. [Marty] Hey, do you believe in reincarnation? 'Cause I do. I believe I'm gonna come back after I die. And I'm coming back as rock star, Michael Jordan, something. Next time, it's gonna be better. So when it gets real bad, you know? you think about that. Think about next time, another chance. Get a grip. You belong in your own wing. You know the rules. Thank you, Dr. Winslow. I'll modify my behavior. Laura... your moods have become unmanageable. You need therapeutic intervention. You can't handle this on your own. You know that now, don't you? I think you're ready to start cooperating. It's time to let go. You've gotten a grip on your anger, haven't you? [whispering] Yes. I'm proud of you. You're gonna be just fine. [chattering] Hey, they let you out. Yeah. Yeah, I don't want any more trouble. I'm just gonna do my time. Tell them everything they wanna hear. Good. That's good. It's easier that way. Yeah. They made me a level two for promising to cooperate. [Marty chuckles] Took me out of Cyclizine. So then, you'll be okay in here without me. What do you mean? I'm getting out today? What happened? I don't know. They just told me to go pack my stuff. [chuckles] That's great. Yeah. Yeah, my dad is going to come pick me up. We're gonna go to our house was going to be a big party. Everyone's going to be there. You know. I'll give you my number. Now that you're in level two. You call me, right? Yeah, I will, I promise. You gonna be okay out there, aren't you? Me? Yes, of course. I told you I'm all better. Really. Okay. Don't forget to take your meds. Yes, I will. I promise. I-- I'm going to miss you. [sighs] You're the only friend I have in here. We'll still be friends. We'll always be friends. [sighs] -[Robert] Hi. -[Woman] Yeah? -[Nora] What do you want? -[Robert] Are you Nora Fields? Last time I looked. I-- I talked to your secretary earlier. My name is Robert Mills. I got your name from my daughter. She's a... patient... at Meadowbrook, which is an adolescent treatment center. I know what it is. Sit down. How'd your daughter get my name. I don't know. But she told me that you knew all about these places. Is that true? I advocate for kids who have been wrongly placed in institutions like Meadowbrook, which you might if you're like most of them. That's not to say there aren't some good ones. There are, but I'm here for the ones that aren't. I'm with this little... David and Goliath thing here, you know. Just glad it's me and my secretary. for the whole operation, so, I'm clearly insane. Herbal... disgusting. So, what can I do for you Mr. Mills? Eh-- My daughter, Laura tried to tell us that there are some pretty awful things that go on in these places. And... to be honest with you, I don't know what to believe. Well, if half of what you said was true, is that enough? Yeah, I guess it would be. I guess you got your answer. Well... let's hope for her sake that you got a lousy insurance policy. I'm sorry, I don't understand. Now you see the length of stay in these place, seems to depend on how much the insurance will cover. Insurance runs out, presto change-o, Johnny's cured. Well, how can they do that? That's not right. [scoffs] Mr. Mills, would you buy a car without checking it out first? I mean, at least kicking the tires. No, of course not. I hate to tell you this, but you just bought a lemon. What do you mean? Did they give you a tour of Meadowbrook? [Robert shuffles on his seat] All right Mr. Mills, I'm gonna tell you a little bit about these private treatment facilities. [sad music] [smile] [sobbing] [sighs] [CJ] Hey, they don't like you to stay in here after the social hour. Thanks. So, did you get in trouble after the fire alarm? That? No, a couple of days in SR, no big deal. Sorry. Forget it. You would've done the same for me, right? Listen, you have to stop getting the injections once they got you hooked on the big T you're theirs. I'm not getting injections anymore. They're just giving me a couple pills. Good. You have to start cheeking them. Why do you care what happens to me? I just do that sometimes. Come on. I went to see someone today, a woman from the Teen Law Office. I think Laura was telling the truth about the things that go on in that place. Why are you doing this? She needs to be there to be watched 24 hours a day. These places like Meadowbrook are dumping grounds for parents looking for easy answers. Easy answers? There's a lot of kids that don't even belong there. Th-- This woman, she was telling me that these hospitals, they overcharge and double building insurance until they bleed them dry. And then they stamp cured on the kid's file and turn them loose. That's not happening at Meadowbrook. We were there. Honey, I think we gotta get her out of there and into some kind of family counseling. [Michelle sighs heavily] You always do this to me. We take a stand together and then you fold and I'm left picking up the pieces. If it weren't for me, nothing would get done in this family. Hey, I work my off every day. -[Michelle] And I don't? -[Robert] I didn't say that. You know, if you had been there, if you had been available for your children, if you would've been willing to take a stand just once, we wouldn't be in this mess. I have a responsibility to my child. She needs me to be strong for her and I'm going to be strong. Where are you going? Out. [door knocks] -[Robert] -Hi. I was wondering if we could talk. Yeah. It's late. I know. I thought maybe we could get a beer. Sure. As long as it's non-alcoholic. I heard Stewart's dad gave you a job. Yeah, they got a big contract with the city. Need an extra hand. It's nothing much, it's just got me doing some groundwork for now. Mostly sub-metering, three-phase wiring, stuff like that. Oh, that's great. Look... I know you didn't bring me here to talk about my job. I know you brought Laura home the other day. But David, I need to know did she say anything about what goes on in that place? Yeah, she did. Sound like a concentration camp in there. And you believe her? She wouldn't lie to me. [sighs hard] We really trying to do what we thought was best. She thought it was best? Wait til she gets out of that place. And she has to go back to school where everyone knows she was in a nuthouse. It's getting late.... No. Wait, wait, Please. Look, I didn't kind of just talk about Laura. I-- I came because I needed to talk to you. Look, David. I know how hard this has been for you. It hasn't been any easier for me. Your mother and I, we haven't said two civil words to each other since you left. So it's my fault then? No, no, no. I have no one to blame, but myself, I know I haven't been the perfect husband or the perfect father. But I'd still like to think that you and I could... [chuckles] It's a little late for you to try and be my dad. Don't you think? I mean, it's not like we're going to go in the backyard and chuck the old football around. Yeah, you're right. But I'm still your father and I love you. [sighs] Look, do you want me to let you off the hook? Fine. You're off the hook. I screwed up, I know that. Living with me was no picnic either, but I'm okay now. I'm not carrying any grudges. Things just turned out the way they turned out. You know, end of story. So you can just stop feeling sorry for yourself, okay? Thanks for the soda. Hey, come on. Let's go back to your room. [Laura] Come on. everything's gonna be okay. You all right? Come on, let's just lie down. Come on. [door creaking] What are you doing here? Maybe I should ask you the same thing. Listen, don't let no one come in please. Fine, tell me what you're doing in there. Why don't we just go back to our rooms and forget about everything, okay? Come on. The attendee comes by 40 seconds. Fine. Thanks. Now we're even. Open. Tongue? I'm proud of the way you've been taking your medication lately. You've just earned yourself another 10 points. [Counselor] It's nice to have you joining us again Laura. I don't suppose you're ready to start participating. My name's Laura and I'm an alcoholic. No, listen. I've told you a hundred times, I cannot do it anymore. That's it. I know, I know, I know, I'm sorry. Look, it's my fault. I guess I have to get it together. I have a family. I gotta start being there for my kids. You know? No, I'm sorry. It's over. That's it. Oh. Mr. Mills. What can I do for you? Well, I've come to get Laura. Yes. Is there a problem? No, no, no, no. There is no problem. We just want her at home. We, is your wife here? No, she couldn't come. I see, have a seat. [Robert clears throat] No, that's all right. I think I'll stand. Mr. Mills, it is not advisable for you to take Laura out of here before her treatment is complete. Just show me where to sign. I'm afraid it's not that easy. We have been authorized by you, her legal guardian and your insurance company to perform a service. We have diagnosed her as being severely depressed. That's enough to mandate a stay here for up to six months. Six months? What are you talking about? Let me try to explain this as simply as I can. If you take Laura out of here against medical advice and she harms herself, you could be liable for negligence. You could lose custody of your daughter. Look, I-- I'll take my chance. Please go get my daughter. I don't know what to tell you. I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Mills. I'm afraid I can't let you take her without your wife's consent. Wh-- What are you talking about? There were two signatures here on the admissions form. Under state law, you to have joint custody. We'll need her signature. That's the law. My hands are tied. [sighs] Phone privilege allows you three calls per week. All calls must be kept to under five minutes, your conversation will be monitored. [David's answering machine] Hi, this is Dave and I'm not here to take your call, so please... I got the machine. Can I make another call? Okay. [Woman] Hello? Hi is Marty there? [Woman] Who is this? I'm a friend of his from Meadowbrook. Can I speak to him? Hello? What? [sad music] [chattering] Marty's dead. He killed himself. Huh-- yeah. He told me that his father was gonna pick him up. Whole family was gonna have a big party for him. Marty didn't have a dad. He lived alone with his grandmother at the trailer park. [sobbing] He told me that everything was gonna be okay. He wasn't ready to go. Listen, whatever problems he had, they only got worse in here. As far as they're concerned, the only thing he suffered from was insurance deficiency syndrome. They shouldn't have let him out. It happens all the time. I'm sorry. [crying] Michelle. We have to go get Laura. They won't release her without your signature. I'm busy right now. We can just come back some other time. It's all right, he's leaving. I have people here, this is my work. What is more important? You work or our daughter? Will you excuse me. Michelle. This is not the time to talk about Laura's problems. Well maybe the problem isn't with Laura. Oh, it's me, huh? I'm too demanding a profe-- Maybe you are. Maybe-- I work too much for my children. Somebody has to want something from them. What do you think I'm doing. I raised those kids. I made their life out of nothing, where the hell were you? Fine, why don't you admit you're married a man who couldn't live up to your expectations. I guess your girlfriends probably have lower expectations, Right? But I deserve a better. We're just gonna leave our card. No, I'm sorry. [Michelle] Please. I-- I-- [sighs] Man, Look, the attendant is going to be by in a minute, Just go back to your room. No, I wanna go on with you. Unless you want me to go get the attendant. We can both explain to him why we're standing out here. [sighs heavily] Help me with this. [door creaks] Here, don't lose it. It's the key to this room. Alright, come on. [CJ] We're gonna look to all these files over here. When you start to take out those files right up there. What are we looking for? Anything with a dollar amount, the billing records, stuff like this here. See this amount here? $860 is their actual cost of medication for one patient from the weeks 8-6 six to 8-19. This is what they billed the insurance company. $20,600? Insurance fraud. Grab those files right there. Why aren't you trying to bust them for all the other stuff that goes on in here? The way they torture kids. Those complaints have to be filed as malpractice suits and you're impossible to win. The way to beat them is to expose the fraud. When the insurance company stopped paying, this place goes out of business. This is crazy. [suspenseful music] Who are they? These are names of people I collected taking kickback money for referrals, school administrators, counselors, teachers, they are on the tape. Dale Carlson is my guidance counselor. Not bad, he's nine grand richer than he was a year ago. I get this into the right hands, this place goes out of business. Who are you, really. My real name is Jason. I'm not really 17. I work for Nora Fields. She is the one who got me in here to try to get enough evidence-- [rattle] [CJ] Come on. CJ... looks like you'll have some explaining to do. Why don't you wait outside? Hmm? [door creaks and closes] Well, do you wanna tell me what you were looking for? Just looking around and the door was open. [suspenseful music] Peterson... Colin James, nickname's, CJ. [CJ] What are you gonna do with me? [Dr. Winslow] I don't know. We'll go to restraint while I decide it. It's clear that you've become a danger, and not only to yourself, but to others. After all, starting a fire in the records office is a serious crime. It's a good thing I caught it in time. [phone dialing] -[Man] Hello. -[Laura] Hi, it's me. -[Man] It's late. -[Laura] I know, I know. But I need you to do something for me. You're leaving? I was saving this for Laura. I wanted our beautiful baby girl to wear this at her wedding [sobbing] Oh Robert, what happened? [crying] How did I push everybody away, was I so terrible? It wasn't just you. I-- I wanted to be perfect. Some of us can't be perfect, I'm sorry. I am sorry-- I am sorry for a lot of things, but... But it's too late. I don't know. I don't know. But we can't let our problems destroy our kids any longer. We've got to save our family. I don't know how to do that. We've got to start by getting Laura out of that place. Alright? Okay. [hopeful music] [phone rings] What do we have here? Yeah. Nora, Hi, its me Laura. Sorry, Laura? I'm still stuck here in Meadowbrook. Can't wait to get out of this place. Laura, right, how are you? Okay. I guess. It seems like ages since we've talked. Yeah. Ages. Hey, it's Jason there. Jason. No. Jason stepped out. He's not in trouble again is he? No, not trouble. It's just he went out. He'll be back in a little while. I'll tell him that you called. Great. Your birthday's coming up. I haven't forgotten. I have something for you. Jason helped me pick it out. But I guess he won't be able to get it to you until I get out. Eh-- Listen to my time's up. I have to go. No, Laura, just wait a minute. Okay? No, I really should go. I'll call you again. Laura. Okay. Gladys, call the district attorney's office. I'm getting the police. How can all of last month's billing records be gone? I don't understand this. I told you, I don't know where they are. You're lying. You've hidden them somewhere. Even if I did know why. Why would I tell you now that I know real scam that goes on in this place. Scam? We provide a service here. We save lives. So you need to justify ripping off insurance companies? If that's what it takes to stop. One more kid from slitting his wrists. Yes. That's how I justify it. All right, that's a winner. I'd love to be there to see you explain that one to the D.A. Listen to me you little punk. I don't know who you think you are but one phone call from me and there is no more CJ Peterson. You will spend the rest of your life in a padded room. You gonna spend the rest of yours in jail so. You're gonna tell me where files are. Kiss my-- [CJ grunts] [panting] [Alright] Dr. Winslow, your telephone's has been waiting for over half an hour. I want everyone to confined to their rooms. Dr Winslow, Hi I'm Mr.Sanders, I spoke to you on the telephone yesterday. Yes Mr. Sanders, sorry I kept you waiting. I-- Dr. Winslow, we've come for Laura. We want her out of here with or without your signatures. Now you lied to me. I checked. I did not, it's hospital policy-- Fine, whatever. Where is she? Forgive me. Something has come up, please excuse me. I'll be back in a few minutes to start the paperwork. Hey, don't walk away from me. We are not gonna wait any longer. Mr. Mills. I will tell Ms. Collins to start the release forms. There's nothing in here. [Security man] I don't understand. I heard you talking to Dr. Winslow. Is there some kind of problem with this place that I should know about? [Repair man] I don't get it either. All I know is we got a signal down at the switching station that said the problem was coming from your cafeteria. [Nurse] Oh yeah? It's just ridiculous. I'm not gonna wait for them. I want you to go get Laura, we haven't got all day. I don't know if I can do that. Oh, I think you can. [Ms. Collins] Dr. Winslow... her parents won't wait any longer. All right. Take her out. I won't be long. [Nurse] Dr. Winslow, the ward is clear. Dr. Winslow. You dropped this. [dramatic music] Ms. Collins! [grunts] [Ms. Collins] Come on! Get her! -[Robert] Come on-- -[Laura] Dad! Dad! Get off me! [Robert] Laura! [Dr. Winslow] Calm down. [Laura] Let me go! [Dr. Winslow] Calm down. Let me go. Laura, don't make a scene. She doesn't have it! Let her go or I'll call the police. [Dr. Winslow] We have reason to believe that your daughter is hiding drugs in her room. He's lying I don't know what he's talking about. We're taking our daughter over here. Now this patient has a borderline personality disorder. She is a danger to herself and to everyone around her. Dr. Winslow, I want to see CJ. If you take her out of here now you're going to be liable-- Dr. Winslow! We have a warrant to search these premises. What the hell was that all about anyway? It's a long story, I'll tell you later. I don't know what to say, these things happen. Thank you. Thanks. Yes! You're about ready? Yeah, almost. You might wanna leave some of this stuff. My place ain't that big. [Laura chuckles] [David sighs] Folks getting along any better? They're trying. So what's the verdict on the college thing? I just told 'em that I needed some time to sort things out. Maybe I'll go next year. [grunts] All right. Let's do it. [Michelle] You have everything? Yeah. Did you want to take your TV? No need still got the one I stole from you guys. Right. [Robert sighs] So Laura, just wanna make sure that you know that... your father and I don't want you to go. Mom, leave it alone, it's her decision. I'm telling her how I feel. [David] Mom, it's her decision-- [Michelle] I'm telling her how-- Every time is going to be like that? Will you guys please just stop fighting? [sighs heavily] [sighs] Let's get out of here. [Robert] Wait, wait, wait, wait. This is ridiculous. You're right. I don't want to fight anymore. We've all made a lot of mistakes. We love you. Um... Maybe you can come by for dinner this weekend. Both of you. Mom's cooking. [chuckles] Could be dangerous. I think we'd like that. [smiles] Bye.
