SPANISH FRONTIER - Good afternoon. - Fill it up. I may be a tourist but I'm not an idiot. Give me the right change. We don't rob anyone here. How many kms is it to Caldeya? 15 kms, sir. Another fool going to Caldeya. God makes them all, women, men, a mixture of the two. Are you mad? Tom Dixon. It's the never-fail method of hitch-hiking. I imagine you're going to Caldeya? - Yes. - Just a moment. - May I? - Yes. I'm working on the portrait of a rock. - Oh, yes? - I've been working on it for a year. The rock itself, not the soul of the rock. I get it. It's technically difficult. I have to get set up on a rock across from it, and the canvas tends to slide around. Do you see? - Yes, of course. Have you tried using a counterweight? That's a good idea. Have you reserved a room? A friend is lending me his house. Reginald, perhaps you know him. Luxury editions for aesthetes. We're business partners. Congratulations. Well, here we are. Have you been here before? - No. - Then, I'll explain. I already know. Sodom and Gomorrah. It's not that. But it's an unforgiving place: hard people, a village of old bones bleached over time. A set for a Shakespeare play, King Lear. Although I think Shakespeare's an idiot. Shall I take you to Reginald's house? I have to pick up the key at Pascal Regnier's. Do you know him? - Yes, one of the pillars of Caldeya. He's an excellent novelist. Whisky and girls, girls and whisky, that's his unvarying timetable, a fantastic person. Daniel, come here. This is Regnier's son. Take this gentleman to Reginald's house, your father has the key for him. Thanks for the lift. Straight ahead. Hi, Tom. Do you want some? - You like to mix fries and ice-cream? - It's what I eat all the time. There's Reginald's house. Stop here, we can't go any further in the car. Come on, let's go. That's our house. These things happen! What are you doing? Are you moving? I'm an idiot! Thank you, I don't need anyone. - Fine. - If you forget something... Don't worry about it, I'll let my dad know. She's a crazy hysteric with her jealous scenes. Where did you come from? - I've brought someone here. Vincent Brener. Oh, right. I remember you. Did you come to get the key? - Yes. - How's Reginald? - He's well, thank you. - What was that idiot doing? - Crying. Well, she can keep on crying as long as she leaves me alone. Just a little technical problem. I was expecting you in August. It is August. Already? - Where did we meet? - In London, at your publisher's house. Right. And now, in Caldeya, we meet at my publisher's house again. He lends me this luxurious house because he thinks I work well here. - It's a nice place, isn't it? - Very much so. A whisky? No, thanks, I'd rather get set up. Right, I'll come with you.. Look... The village is exquisite. I've been told that it's also unforgiving. Absolutely, and it's crazy too. It's a closed place. Focused on pleasure. A place that drives you mad. I'll show you the house, let's go. - It's so like Reginald. - How do you mean? - It's a grotto. - Yes. Kind of. Elegant but reserved. Very barroque. Do you like it? Yes, for what I came here to do. - You came here with something in mind? - Yes. To get myself together. I'm tired. It seems that I need to rest and relax. - And Reginald sent you here. - Why not? - Isn't it a place to recommend? - It depends. - On what? On the strength of your soul. Right, I'll think about it. But at least for tonight, I'll sleep. No way! First, I have to take you to meet Jenny. The famous Jenny. Come on. She's waiting for you. - What is Jenny like? - That depends. She's like a mirror... where men can see themselves. La Estrella. Good evening. - How are things? - It's all good. Hello, darling! Hello, sweetheart. - When are we shutting it down tonight? - Not before dawn, of course.. - Good evening. - Good evening, Regnier. So you see, girls, whisky, ideas... A whole collection of heads and bodies, all within reach. It's been years since I 've seen a player-piano. Some guy called Bryant gave it to Jenny. "All the player-pianos in the world for singing in different ways about fleeting love affairs, and loves that are over." Who wrote that? - Where is Jenny? - Here she is. Reginald's package has arrived labelled "Caution. Fragile". - So that's what you're like? - Is that good or bad? It's not how I imagined him... but good. Good. - Whisky. - Yes, madam. - I prefer brandy. - Right, sir. - I'd have sworn that you liked whisky. - Jenny who's never wrong! I've just recevied a telegram from Reginald. How do you know him? - We've been friends for years. We're also business partners. "Look after Vincent, I think you can help him. but be careful, he's vulnerable. He's very dear to me." Is that all? No. He's added: "Don't devour him". - Is she that dangerous? - Don't ask me, we wild animals don't devour each other. But with Jenny, you never know, she just might get hungry or be scared. That's reassuring! No, you can relax, Reginald knows what he's doing. He's relying on the sister of charity that's hidden away inside her. I'm on my way. See you later, my friends. To welcome you! Do you look after everybody here? No, my refugees can look after themselves. Running away from what? - What are you running away from? - Nothing. Nor are they. - Have you been here long? - Four years, summers and winters. I live next to the church. On your own? I might have a man from time to time, like I might have a drink. Are you homosexual? I don't think so. It's annoying. I can't figure you out. I'm not worth the effort. I'm much too tired to be a trophy worthy of you. Come on, it'll be fun. Hello, Maria. So, is he coming or not? He's coming, he's about to arrive. - Tonight? - Yes. - For sure? - For sure. Would you like to sing us the song he taught you? If you like... "In the village of Moia, "a little shepherd "was guarding his flock "and they say that..." Pay your bill and get out. - Don't get upset! - Get out! - Can't we have a little fun? - No, you can't. - She doesn't understand. - Leave her alone. It's O.K., Maria. The band is going to play now. Oh, good. There's only one house rule here: do not bother Maria. Understood. She's always here as Jenny's guest. She smiles and waits. - For her lover's return, I suppose. Of course. We've got some characters in Caldeya. - It's surprising. As surprising as how fiercely Jenny protects her. There's something going on tonight. Jenny! What's happened? - It's Nora again and it seems to be serious, come on. - What's the matter? - One of Jenny's friends has had an accident. Come on, you can help us. What an idiot! So that's what suicide looks like. Is there a doctor here? - Take him to the doctor's. - Yes, madam. Go on, the girl will show you the way. To cling to life and then kill yourself without really wanting to die. Stop fooling around! Who's fooling around? And who's cheating? She was another one you tried to help. It's not my fault that she fell in love with me. I'm not sure about that. - That's enough. - Yes. That's enough. I hate people who try to help others. - You make me sick. We're friends, aren't we? So stop playing Saint Bernard and look after yourself. Once there's been one victim, another one always comes along. It never stops. And one day you'll find yourself drowning, because some fool didn't know how to swim. Even you, Jenny. Thank you, Regnier. No problem. - Thank you, doctor. - She'll be fine, she needs to sleep. - Good night. - My pleasure. She's been saved. The drama's over, I'm thirsty. Vincent, do you know how to swim? - Yes. - That's good. What did he mean? Regnier and I have a secret language. I'll translate. He thinks I like you. And now you've actually seen a suicide are you still thinking about it? When I left Paris, I said that when I turned 35, I'd draw up a balance sheet. Failures on one side, successes on the other. - When's your birthday? - In three weeks. So we've got time! - And Nora? - What about Nora? Did she do it because of you? I don't know. - Won't you tell me about Nora? - I don't understand. I don't understand anyone at all. Good night. Wasn't bad for your first day in Caldeya, was it? - Hey, Jenny! - 'night! Guys, it`s Serge. Hi, Serge! - Hello, Serge. - Hello. What shall we play? - I've got a brilliant idea. - Tell us about it. Come on! - We`re going to take over the vllage. - What does that mean? It's easy, you invade houses without being seen. You all take over at least one house. - What a great idea! They used to do it in the Middle Ages. - And if we get caught? - Then you get yourself out of it. - That's no fun. - Yes it is, come on! Come on, in pairs. Nadine, stay with me. They're such kids. Things still bad at your house? - Yes. My Dad's got a new bird - you know that little English girl. - The one singing at La Estrella? - Yes, they got going last night. - They're all the same. - It's because Dad's afraid of getting old. - Come on, Serge. - Let's go! Hey, Serge! Serge! Nadine! I've got one! Super! Remy's taken two houses at once. - Others have managed it too. - I'm going with them. There's no-one here. They left on Saturday. - This house is enormous! - Yes. It smells really strange. Yes, like in church. This is heavy! Come and look at this! Can you imagine sleeping here? It's like a boat, you could go anywhere. Are you coming? We can sail away. - It's hot in here. - Yes. You can kiss me. I want you to touch my skin. - Hasn't anyone ever touched you before? - No. Do you like me? You're so pretty. One day I'd like to go away with you. Where to? I don't know, somwehere far away so we could always be together. - Would you want to? - Yes, with you, I would. I'll set it up, you'll see. You're so pretty. Serge... No, no. This way. Decadence. A society that's incapable of imagining its future. Do you understand? Incapable of thinking in the future tense. It's the same throughout the whole of the western world. The Russians and the Chinese are able to thik about their future, but for us, there's only the past that's left. The past bores us and the present terrifies us. Jenny, would you like a drink? No, thank you Nora. Are you enjoying yourself? Madly. He's the one who saved your life. Come on. Nora, this is Vincent. I'm happy to see you so full of life. Are you the one who got me invited here? You live too much on your own. That's unheard of in Caldeya. Let me introduce you to Mr. Bryant, he's the one who invited you. It's the least you can do. I'll be right back. Well, you came to get bored stiff too! I hate all these fools. Then why are you here? Just to find some new reasons to hate them. - Hello. - Let me introduce Vincent Brener. Art ctitic, aesthete and recluse. - Even though he knows you? - It sometimes happens! - I'm pleased Jenny brought you. Excuse me. - Just a minute. Come on. Look me straight in the eye. - What? - Tell me, what's going on with the recluse? - Don't be stupid! - So what's Bryant like? - A millionaire, dull and desperate for love. What else? Oh, yes, we were together five years ago and I still really like him. Come on, I want to show you something. "You're abandonning me too." You idiot! Go away Nora, you scare me. You smell like death. How strange. One day, someone told Bryant to buy some art and this is the result. He rarely comes to look at it. He says it's a gift to his friends. I have a favour to ask you. Go ahead. I'd like you to become Nora's lover. Interesting! What for? I mean, your reason? - I'd like to shake her up a little. - I see. You'll discover the other reasons for yourself. - Agreed? - No. - Why not? - Lack of inspiration. - Nothing else? - Nothing else. - That's a shame. - Who for? For Nora, for me, or for you? I'd like to go swimming. Will you come with me? Yes. I could be right. I could be wrong. I don't know. But I think we need one another. Love? Love. - Do you believe in it? - I must believe in it. I gave it up so long ago. No. Not the Jenny who protects Maria's dreams so fiercely. There's Maria and there's Reginald too. He warned me," Don't devour him" . There's no Reginald. You know what you remind me of? A bullfighter about to go into the ring. He looks at the bull in the same way. You're scared. - It's full of sea urchins. - Where? All over the place. - What's this rock called? - Cucurucu. - And what does that mean? - It means Cucurucu. It's obvious isn't it? Nadine! Nadine! What's she doing? I'm going to find her. Turn over. You're beautiful! It's weird, they're moving. What does this one want? Is he looking for his wife and kids? or his house? At least this one will be happy. Why are you looking at me? We've got a favour to ask you. But you have to promise to keep it a secret. - I promise. - We've made a big decision. - You're going to get married? Not now, only when we're old enough. We're going away together. Where? Just getting away from our parents to live on our own. We've figured it out, but we don't have any money. - How much do you need? - 30.000 francs, or so. - Well, I can get that. - You're terrific! - Why don't you come with us? - Me? Who would look after my dad? Ladies and gentlemen, here you have Tom Dixon, the best known of the unknown painters. - I'm afraid of becoming like them. - Like who? - Like the adults. - Don't even think about it! - But it's how we'll end up. - Not us! What's your name? That's just great! I don't understand a word and neither do you! We're the perfect couple. - A little owl! - It brings bad luck! No way! It's wing is damaged. I found it on the beach. Careful, it bites! - What are you going to do with it? - I don't know. - I know, let it loose in La Estrella, you'll see. - You think? - It'll be amazing! - Do you want to? - Here. - Did you see its legs? - And its eyes. We're going to have a good laugh. - I'll come with you. - So will I. No, Daniel'll go alone. The rest of you stay here. Act naturally. - Sure. - What have you got in that bag? - Nothing. Say hello to my son. Perfect, she doesn't speak any known language. Do you have any idea how much time that saves? That's just great. Sorry. - There's only hookers and drunks here. - Yes, sir. Praise be to hookers and drunks! The kingom of God is open to them. Long live rehabilitation! Long live love! And praise be to the sisters of charity! That's enough. You have to drink! You have to drink to escape death. The more you drink, the closer you are to it. Ironic isn't it? And so melodramatic! - Do you like my novels? - Yes, I really do. I don't. If I was certain I would escape death, I'd be a great writer. Failing immortality you have to put up with all this. There's also yoga, God... Stamp collecting. And eroticism, Jenny. Eroticism! No, don't touch it! It's come back. This bird is an omen. Ancient bird of wisdom... - Here he goes! Ancient bird, it's written in one of my books: "The day that the little owl comes to visit me..." He'll start to bug us again! Is there any sensible way, my flying friend, to save this world of idiots? You're rotten! - I'd rather be rotten than impotent. - I'll show you... The impotent serve a useful social purpose because they are ideal cuckolds. So there! Regnier! - Get out the way, kid! - But, what's happening? - He insulted France! - He insulted France? Maria! Come here! - Don't move from here. - No. Call the police! Come and hide quickly. Thank you for the owl, Daniel, it was a really nice gift. - They're keeping him a long time. - Don't worry about my dad, For one thing, Jenny's with him. And he's probably stll talking. The police love listening to him. I don't know if you've noticed, but my dad loves to talk, Yes, I had noticed. Mr. Regnier, everyone here likes you a lot, but such behaviour really can't be tolerated. I'm not telling you as a friend but as the commanding officer here. Excuse me, sir, can you sign my book for me? Of course. Excuse me. Have you read it? - I think it's your best novel. - It's so moving. - It is, isn't it! Here. - Thank you. - I'm sorry, what were you saying? - Nothing. That took a really long time! You know, nothing bad can happen to me as long as you're with me. Is that true? Nothing in the world is true, except that. I'm going to buy an ice cream. Do you want one? - Great! You dump so many responsibilities on to that poor kid. What do you mean? "Nothing bad can happen to me as long as you're with me". Yes, you're right. I'm a real shit. But I'll redeem myself, you'll see. I'll eat an ice cream. Here! - They've closed the bar for 3 days. - Because of Regnier? No, it's just an excuse like every year. Then later, there'll be the fine. I count it into general expenses. Three days! We could go somewhere, just the two of us. - Are you sure? - Yes. In Caldeya everyone is very easy-going, and not very responsible. Being on our own wiil be quite different. On our own, somewhere else. - Let's go! Anywhere! Barcelona! - No! - Why not? I don't know, but I'm a bit scared for you. Don't say that, nothing bad will happen to me if you're with me. I've never seen a woman pack her bags so quickly. I used to be a maid once. Don't laugh, it's true. Right, I believe you! Reginald, i don't believe it! It took 48 hours and I drove all night but it was worth it to find you in such good shape. Tanned, clear-eyed, a little agressive perhaps... You're looking good, Vincent, and that makes me happy. Thank you, Reginald! - Suitcases? Why? - I'm going to Barcelona. Great idea, I'm sorry to wreck it for you. We'll go together another day. I'm sorry, Reginald, I want to go now. But I drove all night to see you. And whose is this? Jenny's. I'm going to Barcelona with her. Perfect! There's no one better than Jenny for showing you Barcelona. Yes, she's here. Jenny! My princess! The sunshine of Caldeya! Good morning, Reginald. Good morning, love of my life. - Are you coming down, Jenny? - Right away. Jenny, you're a picture. Younger than ever. You're looking wonderful! You should have let us know. I don't mind him going. I got 3 manuscripts to read and one of them is 400 pages. Oh I forgot, I brought you a little gift, perfect for the trip. Reginald, listen! Look at this. Do you like it? Paulina worked like mad to get it finished in time. Put it on. No... You're not going to refuse it, are you? Thank you! Bon voyage! Good riddance! Be careful all the same, there's some dangerous curves. "Whoever drinks from that fountain will return to Barcelona." - Have you drunk from it? - Yes. With Bryant? No, on my own. I used to work in this hotel. - In this hotel? Really! What did you do? - I already told you, I was a maid. I thought that was a joke. - Because you're a snob. - It's true, I am a snob. And you? You're beautiful. And you're going to save my life. - From all the dragons in the world. Who can that be? Wait a moment. It's flowers for me. Who from? Without reading the card, I bet they're from Reginald. "I'm faster than Sputnik and I want these flowers to arrive in Barcelona before my beloved Jenny." He's quite remarkable. He's sly. - You're wrong, he's very nice. - I love you, but don't be an asshole. I love you, but don't be crude! But I am crude, my darling. - I'm sorry. - It's fine. Jenny, I'm really sorry. What are you doing? I'm arranging my beloved Reginald's flowers. Jenny, please... Don't tell me this is crude! I would rather you said it's extraordinary, or ridiculous. O.K. it's extraordinary and ridiculous. Caldeya is my refuge. I'm always afraid to leave it. Let's go back. Let's admit that it's all over between us. No. I love you, believe me. - I do believe you, but it's all over. - Jenny, I'm fighting for my life! Help me! But you'll have to let me make mistakes. Make your mistakes, darling. And forgive mine. No, Vincent, darling! Bravo! What a sight we are! But that's enough! I'm really sorry! We behaved like new young lovers. No,we're not in the right mood to make love. Let's go out. I'll get ready. You get dressed. Wait for me in the bar. Another double. It's that bad? I'd like one too, a whisky. Yes, madam. - Tell me the story of your life. - Are you crazy? - That's what everyone does in bars. - All right then, here you are: When I was 16, I had a child. He died. The father disappeared. My parents threw me out. I met another guy, the love of my life. He died too. I was going crazy so I came to Spain. I was out of control. Without Bryant, I'd have ended up a hooker. He bought La Estrella for me. I live there on my own, and disguise myself as a strong woman. And everyone believes it. - Except Regnier. Well done. You're very perceptive! - I'm jealous of Regnier. - I'm pleased to hear it. I'd like to have the right to be jealous. Oh! Just like Hamlet! Blond, blue eyes, Nordic... Listen, please call number 42 in Caldeya, Mr. Reginald. No! I said no! - We left so quickly... - That's enough, Jenny. - Are you trying to test me? - Yes. Did I pass? You got 18/20. And why not 20/20? You were too emotional. "You can't turn back. "It's imposible to turn back." Excuse me, excuse me, sir. Keep a tight hold on him, my dear, we'll eat him alive otherwise. Why did you bring me here? My name is Eurydice and I'm taking you to hell. I love you. You'll get to know victims and ghosts. I love you. You'll get to know wounded and disfigured people. You'll be a good Christian and won't judge them and you won't judge yourself either. What about you? Will you judge me? What right would I have? Come on, I'll introduce you to a friend. It's not possible! Jenny! Jenny! - I'm so happy to see you. - Don't I get a kiss? Who wouldn't want to kiss you? - Pablo, this is Vincent Brener. - Pleased to meet you. Delighted. Come and sit down. Still as young as ever, Jenny. You've got as fat as a pig! How can I explain to Mr. Brener how handsome you were? I was irresistible. But I'm being very rude. Let me bring you something to drink. At the very least, he's exhuberant. He was my lover. No, I don't believe it. Yes he was and he loved me. I can't believe it. What are you trying to prove, Jenny? Why are you putting me through this? We've both hit rock bottom but I'm not going to let the past drag me down again. Let's pull ourselves up, Vincent. I know we can do it together. - How's business? - Not bad. You should come and see me. Too much sun for me. Poverty, smells, sunless streets, that's what he likes. I don't want to work any more. I'm fed up with working so that pimps can eat! I'm fed up with pimps! You are disgusting! You're really disgusting! You're really disgusting! On your own, blondie? - What are you doing? - Mercy! Let me go! Leave me alone! Take that! Let me go! - Leave him alone! - Leave me alone! Very good! Very good! - Give him one! - Kill him! - Get lost! - Kill him! Let's kill this one! Why are you getting involved? - Take that! - Watch out, here come the police! - Police! - Come on,let's go! If ever I needed an apartment, it was Reginald. A car, it was Reginald. A job, it was Reginald... If I needed to be with a girl it was at his house. I even got to know you through Reginald. Reginald knows how to be patient. Are you mad at me? Yes, because you made me cry. I had promised myself... Listen to me, I'm not trying to hurt you... There's one thing I have finally understood, We deserve whatever happens to us. We deserve what we come up against. We deserve the ones we love, and so... my lover of less than 24 hours, you have to get used to who you are and forget who you would like to be. And you're the one telling me this? Yes. He lets me go away from time to time. Why is that? To prove you can't survive without him. Are you sure Daniel will come back? Yes, he's always late. - Perhaps he won't bring the money. - Doesn't matter, we leave tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Aren't you ready? Kiss me, I like it when you kiss me. - Oh, excuse me. - There you are! Did it go well? Yes.Here. 30 grand. Fantastic! You're amazing! So, are you leaving? - Tomorrow, can't wait any longer. - Of course. - Are you ready? - Why? With girls ... - What if Nadine changed her mind? - Why did you say that? - I don't know. - You're crazy. I'm saying she won't go with you. Is that true, Nadine? - I wanted to tell you yesterday. - Tell me what? I can't just leave. I'm scared. I didn't think you really wanted to... - Really wanted to... what? That you really wanted to leave. It's not worth blubbering, You shouldn't have playacted. - I wasn't playacting. - You've been stringing him along and you shouldn't playact with Serge. Ever! You're a bitch. Here, blow your nose. - Let's go. You're as beautiful as a fruit, as an orange. My Orange. You're woman reduced to the simplest state, the most restful... We can invent everything, even a language. It's the beginning of a new world. The sun, we'll call it... "Avrou". Come here. "Avrou". "Avrou", say that. - "Avrou"? Very good. "Nuray". "Nuray" means 'to eat'. - "Nuray". - "Nuray"? "Aroun". "Aroun" is this. - Oh, "Aroun"? - "Aroun". "Lanou", means this. You're like a cat, a real little kitten. What does our language need to be complete? Oh, to make love. To make love will be... "Rupa". "Rupa". "Rupa". Five words can be a whole world, for now anyway. Soon you'll have to learn "to cry", "to wait", "to break up"... One thing at a time! How did you know she didn't want to leave? All her friends knew. - You know what? - What? I love Nadine. It was the first time I could tell someone everything. She took everything from me. Perhaps she loves you anyway. No, if she loved me, she would have gone with me. There's no other way. - Take your money, I don't need it now. - Keep it, you never know. - What would I use it for? - You figure it out! I'm going to bed. You coming? No, I'm going to stay here for a while. O.K. See you tomorrow. That's all I need! - What's the matter? - That girl! - That girl what? - Is she going to stay here? For a day, a week, a month, who knows? You don't, I don't, she doesn't either. - Well I don't want that. - You don't want what? - All this. - Do you want her to stay here? - I don't want anything, I don't care. - You don't care! - Can I finish shaving? To eat? "Aroun"? You stupid bitch! She's pretty. Very pretty. Is she for you or for Daniel? - What are you doing here? I thought you were in Barcelona. - Well, as you see... - It didn't go well? - It was a disaster. I'm really sorry, Jenny. What can I do? - Nothing, Don't be kind or I'll spit in your face. Spit in my face, if you like, I'll still love you anyway. I'm sorry. Forgive me. Did you love him? Go and play with your little girl, she'll get bored without you. O.K. But one day I'll spend time with you, you need taking in hand. Go away and leave me in peace. Tell me, Jenny, how can I help you? Who once said to me:" Who do those who help others think they are?" Garul! Garul! Go ahead. Garul! - What do you want? - I've come on Serge's behalf. Quick, we're eating, I'll get in trouble. What does he want? - Nothing. He's gone. - Where? He's left the village. First, he climbed the hill with the olive trees, behind the church. and then... - Then, what? - I don't know, it depends on you. - Nadine! - He'll wait there for you 'til midnight. - But I can't go. Then whatever happens will be your fault. - That's not fair. - Nadine, come and eat. And you think it's fair for Serge? Nadine, where are you? Well then? - Did you see her? What did she say? - Nothing, she was crying. It's all she knows how to do. She's an idiot. - Drop her. - I can't. Listen! - What are you going to do up there alone? - I know she'll come. And if she doesn't? Then I'll leave on my own. Serge! Good luck! Who's winning? Who's cheating? We have our standards, we don't cheat at cards. We just cheat at life. That's enough, Nora! I'm going to teach you another game. That's Jenny and this is us moving around her. And who wins? Well that's just it, nobody wins. Everyone loses in this game. Not me. I'm leaving, Jenny. I've had the offer of a job to make costumes for a play in New York. Accept it. You have to get away from here. I was sure you'd say that to me. But she'd have preferred you to say it with less enthousiasm. This is all such a pain! I've had enough of all these dramas, Can't we just have fun? At least, we used to laugh. - I came to say goodbye, Jenny. - Goodbye. There's nothing else to say. - Goodbye, Nora. - Goodbye. - Goodbye to your rock, Tom. - Goodbye, Vincent. - Is Vincent going? - Yes. Goodbye, Reginald. Thanks, Jenny, you did well. As Daniel would say, I was "brilliant". Goodbye, Vincent. Did you love him? You know, as we approach 40, we get worried and search desperately. Are you afraid of getting old? Aren't you? - What are you doing here? - Let me go, Serge is up there. - What's going on? - A boy has died in the fire. Serge! Serge... He's my friend. He's my friend. Come on. Go home, don't cry. Come on, let's go home. Keep back, please. Back, please. Move back, please. Daniel! Jenny! He's dead and it's my fault. - No, no... - Yes. I helped him leave, I couldn't stop him. It was an accident, it's not your fault. What do you know? Nothing matters to you, you don't know anything about it. Daniel. Jenny, I don't want him to talk to me. Tell him to go away. - I don't want to hear him - Daniel! You know that your father loves you more than anything else in the world. - Dad, I didn't really mean it. - I know, I know. He lit a fire so Nadine would see it and understand, so that she could find him, and that's why Serge... got all burned up, all over. With his eyes wide open. Now, try and get some sleep. - Dad, I have to tell you something. - We'll talk tomorrow. We can talk tomorrow but I have to tell you this tonight. I stole 30.000 francs from you for Serge. He was going to leave. - 30.000 francs? 30,000, not one cent more. Let's not talk about it any more. - We'll talk tomorrow, won't we? - Yes, I promise you. So, suddenly, you've decided to take over my life, my timetable, the women I see, my work and what else? I thought I would be able to talk to you... Oh, I'm sorry. You can tell me anything you like. In fact, you have to tell me. Sit down. - Could we stay here this winter? - Stay here? Why not? - We would freeze in this house. - We could find another one. And your studies? There's no school here. There's classes by correspondence. We could always try it? What would we lose? It's strange. - What? - You and me, for years you've been like a mischievous delicate little animal and suddenly you've become a witness to my life - and a judge and I didn't realize it. - But I don't judge you. - Yes you do and with good reason. My friends with divorced parents live with their mothers, why don't I? Because I wouldn't accept that. I wanted you with me, you're a part of me. Your mother loved someone else, not me. It was her great passion. - Why don't I ever see her? She never asked to see you. Little by little, she came to hate me. I suppose you would remind her of that hatred. Daniel, tell me the truth, and take your time to think before you answer. Have you been unhappy with me? - Oh, no! I'm only unhappy when I'm at boarding school. In a certain sense, my life is a disaster but I'm not complaining, No one escapes their fate. But until today something has always saved me from complete despair, our relationship, our way of life. Do you understand what I'm saying? - I understand. However, I'm terrified at the thought of spending winter here although it could be a good break. So, we'll stay here? - If I go crazy, you'll be responsible. - O.K. Come on, let's go! - "Rupa"? - No, not now. You understand her? We've invented a language so we can understand each other A private game? I'm with my son. Go to bed. "Rupa"? Go to bed, but on your own. "Rupa." Here, they gave me this for you. Thank you, that's kind of you. It's from Nora. "I hate goodbyes. "I'm on my way to Paris. "Tonight I leave for New York. "Don't forget me too quickly." In a few days, there'll be no one left in Caldeya. The end of summer is so sad. "Avrou". "Avrou" is finished. There's no more sun. It's autumn. But it's not the end of the world. Sure, it's raining, but there's no need to cry like this. Orange, listen... Well, shit! You again? Are you spying on me? - No, what's happening? Orange has been crying for 2 hours because there's no more sun. - Do you want me to look after her? - Yes, find her some sun. - "Avrou". - "Avrou"? There's no more sun, no more holidays, no more of you in this bed. I'll give you a tip. You want some sun? The sun is further south, in Malaga, in Morocco, what the hell. Come on, get up! Get dressed. I'm not looking. Come on, let's go. Do you have any money? Cash? Here. - So, you threw her out? - Yes. - And your father? - I haven't seen him yet. That's enough ice cream, I'll bring you something more substantial. OK great! Jenny is beautiful. - Do you remember my name? - Yes. You're called Daniel. - Come on! Beautiful! Wait, Jenny. I've persuaded Dad to stay here for the winter. - No way. - Yes, really. Congratulations! There's just one problem. We have to leave our house and find another one. I'll find one for you. At this time of the year, it'll be easy. Yes, but without a woman... Hello, Jenny, hello. What are you planning? And look at me when I'm speaking to you. How come you've never slept with my dad? What! Come on Jenny, you know I'm precocious. O.K, keep talking. - Do you think my dad is handsome? - Yes, very. - And the best writer in the world? - Pretty much. And you like him? Let's recap. You want a house for your father - mine. And a woman in the house - me. - Jenny, what a great idea! Dad will be delighted! - Have you spoken to him about this? Not exactly, but he likes you, I know that. And if we work together, he won't be able to resist. You monster! Iago! Machiaveli! Do you realize how much fun the three of us could have? That's right. Oh, here you are! Where's Orange? - She left. - What do mean, she left? - On the bus. - Are you pulling my leg? You threw her out? - She hated the rain. - You find that funny? - Irresistible. She finds it funny! She finds it funny! The winter here, without a woman, as a bachelor, what else? Well, we're not spending the winter here in Caldeya. - But you promised! - Doesn't count any more, you traitor. He promised. - And he wants me to say he's right. - I think he's right. - Can you see me here in winter? - Very easily. Well then I'm done for, you and him, a sacred alliance. What can you do here in the wiinter? - Lots of things. I get it! All the drinks are on me. It's my day today! A special day! Let's have some fun. Your good health! - Yours too, Mr. Regnier. Come and have a drink with us, it's my special day today, I'm getting serious, I'm settling down in Caldeya for the winter in the corner by the fire and I'll go to mass. I swear, I'll even learn to knit. Shit! Poor Regnier... My rock has been born, here he is. It's a special day for me, too. Let's see, we'll take the canvas and take a look at the rock. The rock of rocks. Young man, this is not a rock, a thousand times no. This, young man, is a sponge. - Why do you say that? - I should say it's a "butt sponge". -What? -It's an "eponge a cul". Obviously impossible to translate into English. - Don't say that! - But it's the truth. The truth. Get back, you drunken piece of shit! "Here lies Regnier, transformed into a bourgeois by Daniel's passion and Jenny's benevolence, Autumn, 1964." You and me, pretty funny, isn't it? - I'm your prisoner. - No, just my hostage. There's a large room upstairs where you can work. I teach you about winter in Caldeya. The best thing is that I feel ready to write. My subject: "Taming wild animals" You and me in a book. The story of two monsters. With Daniel just as wild as us. Vincent will come into it, too... I mean to say... Vincent and me. Why? I'm writing a peaceful story. The Vincents among us disturb the peace. They freely expose their problems and want to foist them on anyone. I admit he bothered me. But now I'm over it. Yes, but with a few scars. Scars are our badges of honor and I've got so many scars that I must look like a matador! I really like you, Jenny. We'll be good together. I can't make you very unhappy since you expect nothing of me. Don't count on it. Oh, Jenny, dear Jenny, I've never felt so calm and so much at peace with myself. Well, I don't guarantee you peace. We don't necessarily love each other but we're so good together. And you can just leave us alone! We don't love each other. English subtitles: Nocturne
