It's time to go. Okay. Jude. Let's go, baby. Shh. Come on. Hurry. Mr. Hamilton, we're doing everything that we can. I haven't always been good to her. She doesn't deserve this. Don't think about that now. Just, you know, forgive yourself and be nice to her. Hey. Are you married? - No. - Okay. Because I was thinking, my friend, Hank, he has a small farm in Nebraska. And he could really use a hand. I don't think that house has been cleaned since we were listening to The Bee Gees. Hank's not for everybody, but I think you'd like him. That's very kind of you, um, but I couldn't leave my job or my other job. - Alice. - Thank you, though. Thank you. We need you in there, not out here. Bye. Come on, Alice. It's really all I can do for you. I don't mean to be rude but firing me is all you can do for me? That's the conclusion I've reached, Jeff. But I haven't done anything. That's exactly my point. We're trying to sell some mattresses here, put some people to sleep. I don't see your contribution. I just need a little more time to get the hang of it. There are many of us who doubt that would make any difference. Actually, I think we're all agreed that you're pretty bad at just about everything. That... That's not, that's not true. Name just one thing you are good at. I'm sorry. This is so cool. We should keep this. What if we get a new house? I want you to have it. That is very nice of you, but we don't need it. We're on vacation. It's great, though. We got crazy lucky. It probably fell off a truck or something, right into our lives. Well, I don't think that it's gonna fit right into our trunk. Besides I have to confirm where we're staying. We just give it to someone else then. Everybody likes a good chair. That's why we're gonna leave it here for someone else to find. Where are we now? Some place you've wanted to go for a long, long, long time. The mall? Better! - Look. - Not New York. Yes! That is Manhattan. But Dad says we don't like New York. I've never been to Manhattan, so, I really wouldn't know. What about school? New York is going to be a kind of school for you. So... I'm tired. More pancakes? You've only had 11. - I gotta go to the office. - Now? Yeah. I'm in court at 8 a.m. tomorrow. - So, I will see you on Tuesday? - Tuesday? - My group. You said you'd go. - Did I? I'll be honest. It's very helpful. Helps me get through all those times I have to defend someone I know is guilty. And they're found not guilty. Yes. So, you forgive them? I forgive myself. What's the damage? - I'll get that. - Are you sure? Yeah. I invited you to celebrate. This is true. All right, goodnight. Congrats on your first day as a free man. Putin gets up at seven or eight. That's right. The time difference between Moskva and... Excuse me. I just need to pay my check. Have another drink. Did your friend leave? - My lawyer. - Those guys get up so early. I've heard that Putin sometimes gets up at 4:30 a.m. This is your place? We are only the advisors. Timofey is the owner. The service is terrible. Not as bad as the food. What can I tell you? Did you try the celery thing? - Nah. - It's disgusting. You don't by any chance for some reason play the double bass balalaika, do you? Do I look like someone who plays bass balalaika? Don't worry. It's absolutely all right. - Everyone can learn. - He said no, Timofey! It doesn't hurt to ask. He ask everyone. Please. We have a lot on the plate at the moment, but we care very much for this house. Timofey, he inherited everything from his grandfather who came here right before the revolution. He did not leave Russia for political reasons. On the contrary, he always remained loyal to whichever regime was in the Kremlin. But, Timofey, your heart isn't in it. Please, Sergei. We've had this conversation. Many New Yorkers feel uncomfortable sitting in these surroundings. Just as an example, we don't know how to make that celery dish work. I know how to run a restaurant. Interesting. - Hmm? - Hmm. Hi. Oh, hi. Can I come in? Uh, eh... Yeah, sure. Thanks. So, you're in the city, huh? Yeah. Just drove down from Buffalo. Richard is looking for you. Um, could you just not tell him that I'm here? Why would I lie to him? He's my son. Those boys of yours are my grandsons. You hardly even know them. Well, they're never here. Richard wouldn't let us come. Are they here now? I'll see you. Next time you come, you scrub up first. Will you? No. Want a donut, dear? We need a place to stay. Just for a couple of days. Just me and the boys. I promise they won't be any trouble. You had a fight, you took the car. It's my car. Where are you going? Just sightseeing, really. Me and the boys have never been anywhere. They need a little, um, education. Oh! Classy. Yeah, so take them to see the Statue of Liberty and then you go home, okay? Richard needs you. I have to call him. No, please don't. Please... Don't call him. You know what'll happen. He's insane. Hey. Richard is the best cop I've ever seen. Now move your hand. I wanna call my son. He's started beating up Anthony now. I, uh... I don't... I don't wanna come between you two. I'm sorry, but I can't let you stay here. How about some money? I don't have anyone else. He took my credit card. Just a little money for gas and food for the boys. I can't do that. Excuse me? Do we like them? I don't know. Why don't you try it? They're good for you. What's the black stuff? Um, they're eggs from a fish. Just try it, okay? I want you to be worldly. Fish lay eggs? Yeah. They're called hors d'oeuvres. Where did you get them at? Mmm, they're from Russia. - Anna? - Well... I used to rent out non-existing apartments, get the deposit and then just disappear off the face of the earth. And then I got thousands of dollars out of sleepless, lonesome people selling them fake melatonin on the Internet. So... Being here makes me able to look people in the eye again. The other day, for example, I went right into a store and bought a bra. Thank you for sharing that. It's true. I'm still wearing it. You wanna have a look? No, I'll pass. - John Peter? - No. Maybe some other time. Marc, you're new here. Do you wanna maybe tell us a little bit about yourself? I don't think Marc knows if this is the right group for him yet. Forgiveness? What could be wrong with that? I'm just here to support John Peter. John Peter is a defense attorney and he has to live with seeing guilty people go free and having innocent people go to jail for murder and everything. Thank you very much for that. The works. He's lost so, so, so, so many cases. Thank you, Bonnie. John Peter, last week, was it you who said that you feel uncomfortable with other people? You feel like you don't trust them? People lie. Anyone here can verify that. Marc, what do you think about that? They do. Most people only think about themselves. And food. They are constantly eating. What about work? I have a job at a restaurant. That would explain the eating. Touche. Do you talk to anyone at work? No, it's Russian. A Russian restaurant? Receptions, ballroom... - Caviar. - Caviar. Cameron? I think it's unbelievable how many people suck at dancing. Right. - Beer? - Can't. Work. - Good? - Yeah, I can do what I want. I haven't seen anyone since the day I got the job. Well, if I find myself a girlfriend, we will come and have dinner. Give it a couple of weeks. The food is still pretty awful. So are the women who would come to have dinner with me. This is from the hospital. If I were you, I'd wear some gloves. Where are your gloves? I forgot 'em, but I'll remember 'em tomorrow. Are you a temp? Yeah. I'm hoping, though, if the week goes well, that I can... Who sorted this? - This is just not happening. - What? Are you aware of what could have happened? How could you? You just... You just grabbed Beyonce and threw her in there? This is his dog. She's a living person. Does she look like laundry? A little bit, kinda. I'm sorry, Jeff. The dog is fine, but Rafael just can't seem to forgive you. So... There's an ATM just around the corner. I can't take out any more cash today. Because my husband... Um, we've reached our limit on our card because he bought a car today on the card. A Toyota actually. A Toyota Avalon, I think. Have him come pick you up, then. If the room's empty already, what's the harm, right? We'll be in and out so quiet and... I'll clean up after us, I'll make the beds in the morning. No one has to know. What can you lose? I'll lose my job. Then I'll lose my room. Then I'll lose my address and my chance of getting another job. Sorry. You just don't look very... Bankable. Is this for work? Soup. Sometimes it's pretty good. Are you here to help? Um... Yeah... I'm not... This side? I'm Alice. You want these for that. You're gonna get the hang of it just fine. Next! I need your ID, please. I can't give it to you. Is there a search warrant out for you? I just can't give it to you. What, don't you have family? I have my two sons. How do I know they're your kids? 'Cause she's our mom. Right. Hi, Glenda. You know, you can call the police for protection, if you... So, there is a warrant out for you? No. Can we just shower? We'll be in and out. Ten minutes tops. Pass me towels. Just this once. Thank you. It's down the hall, okay? I'll buzz you guys through. - Thank you. - Make it quick. Go ahead. Do you think I can borrow her computer? No, you have to wash your hair. Hello, Alice. - Hi, Timofey. - Can I take your coat? No, I'm wearing my uniform. Looks nice in here. Yeah, I'm not so sure. Long day? It's so peaceful here. Yeah. I'm just gonna have my usual. Just a small size. Spasiba. Alice is a regular. She's always alone. For a while I assumed she was a manicurist, which I understand can be quite demanding in this neighborhood, but no, she has a totally different job. Totally. A nurse. The consomme of the day, - just don't make those again. - Okay. Perhaps soup is out of our league. I usually just tell people that we're out of everything except for the caviar. People like it and you can't go wrong, it's straight out of a can. Can you just stay out of the kitchen, please? Sorry, yeah. Small size caviar, three pancakes, no lemon, please. Oh, by the way, I think my grandfather left a couple of interesting champagne coolers in your apartment. You could take them down here if you need cabinet space up there for the... For the clothes you don't really seem to have. Wow! Now, read, okay? I don't like to read. I know. You gotta try. I'll be back really soon. Be quiet, okay? Stay where you are. How did that work out for you? Oh, nothing worked for me. Let me know if I can help you with something else. I'm Stella. Thank you. Here. Food. Come on, Anthony. It's time to get up. Where's Jude? He's not here? He was here before. How long have you been sleeping? I wasn't sleeping. Why do you look like a spy? I told you to stay where you were. Jude! Jude! Come on. He probably went back to the car. He won't remember where we parked. Maybe he went up to a cop. I told him he can't do that. Jude! Jude! Jude! Mom! - Anthony. - Mom, Jude! Mom, hi! You must be out of your mind. We almost had to call the fire department. That would have been great. Or the police. Can you imagine? I could have lost you. I wanna see more of Manhattan while I'm here. You will. We're not going home. I want some food. Some Russian food. Not right now. Some hors d'oeuvres, please. I'm thinking those little eggs. I said not right now. We're never going back, right? No, honey, we're on vacation. - Promise? - Yes. Get in the car. Listen. Where are we? It's real. It must be coming from a concert hall. What's that? It's a theater but only with music. So what do you look at? I think people mostly just close their eyes. It's back through there and up the stairs. - Excuse me? - Sorry. It's my accent. The ladies' room is back through there and up the stairs and is, uh... "badabing" the correct word? I think so. Thank you. More? Thank you. You weren't here for the dinner, were you? No, I had to work late. I'm an interior decorator. I do hotels, so... You know, mostly bedrooms. - Bedrooms? - Mmm. Are you part of the family? Um, yes. I'm the aunt. The aunt? This is a silver anniversary. Well, Glenda and Dave... They got married so young. - Glenda and Dave? - Mmm-hmm. I thought they were Russian. The parents gave them American names. But, you know, we love them to pieces anyway. Ah, babushka, there you are! It's those ones over there. Of course. Thank you. Bye-bye. What are you doing up there? Come on down. Come on. Where were you? Just at a party. It wasn't fun. Come on. Was Dad there? No, honey, he can't find us. It's too big a city. Let's go. Do we have any food? What were you doing up there? Was it the music? I couldn't sleep. Do we have any food? I'll find something. Let's get in. What do other people do? Where do they go? Probably sleep on someone's... ...fold-out bed. Maybe they go to their family. Folks... Yeah. Other people have folks. We don't. Dad... I hate him. Once he made me hit Jude. Hard. Otherwise he'd beat us both up. So I did it. I hit Jude a lot of times. It's not your fault. Hey, um... Hey. I'm sorry I keep pestering you. You didn't have to do that. I'm not even a psychologist. It's fine. I'm just here to keep John Peter company. You are terrific. Seriously. I know... I for one would be toast if it wasn't for this and you. She's very good, Marc. You can talk to her. You don't have to talk to me. Tell her. It was his brother. They worked at a restaurant together. His brother was a drug addict and a dealer. Um... Marc tried in vain to get him out of that stuff, but his brother just kept on doing bad stuff with very bad people. One day the police raided their restaurant. Judge gave him eight years. Marc didn't want to appeal. You were his attorney? John Peter got me out after four years. My brother died of an overdose after I'd been in prison for two years. I ran the kitchen there. I'm completely over it now. Right. Uh, I'm so sorry. I've gotta get to my other job. Yeah. Um... You want us to walk you to the subway? Maybe another time. I think I'd like that. We should go. Just ten more minutes. I just wanna check something. We gotta get back to the car. Next time. Let's go. Come on. Why? Because... The bigger the city, the more parking tickets you get. What is it you keep doing on that computer? Nothing. Don't worry about it, Mom. Where are we going? Sightseeing. Sometimes I see people that look like Dad. I know, honey, but it's just the uniforms. Can he find us when we get parking tickets? Not in New York. Wait a minute. This is where we parked, right? Yeah. Where's the car? Promise we won't go home? Yeah. It's just the parking tickets. They can take the car and put it in a lot somewhere. Can we get it back? - It's in your dad's name. - Mmm. Well, when you live in New York you don't really want a car, so... That is exactly what I thought. I'm cold. Hey, guess what? I've got a surprise for you. What is it? A surprise. Come on, come on, come on! Well, I think we can just sit down, don't you? Mmm. I think they've forgotten us. It's a pity the service is so bad since the food is so delicious, huh? - Hmm. - Yeah. I don't think I'm hungry anymore. Are you? No, not really. Not really. God, I'm so glad you're all right. I'll buy you dinner. How did you find us? I'm a cop. I've got friends. Boys, what can I get you? Hmm? Clara... Something sweet and sour? S... Soda... Soda. Soda, good, yeah. Jude? Thank you. Here you are, sir. - Thanks. - For you, sir. Can I go to the bathroom? It's down the hall. Sure. This is for you. Thank you. Please... Please come home. It's been a long time now, you've made your point. I'll forgive you. Just come home. We need each other, right? I just need a few more days. You know I can't give you that. The boys need their father. Oh! I... I should... Can I? Yeah. - Come on. - Sorry. It's okay. Come on. Here you go. Mom! Mom! Over here. Go! Come on! Hey. Thanks. Thank you, sir. No problem. - There you go. - Thank you. Thank you. Hey. Do you need something? Jude. Thank you. Say thank you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Are we still on vacation? Not so much. No. Are we homeless? We are no more homeless than anyone else here. Are you homeless? Jude. Oh. Hey. Hey, Will. I've been trying to reach you. Yeah... Don't you have a phone? I lost it. That's not true. It was on top of the toaster and then it slipped inside. And then I turned on the toaster and so I melted it. Is that why the power went off last week? Could be. I was in the middle of drying my hair. Looks nice. And the whole building's complained. And, Jeff, you're four months behind with the rent. I know. When's the next time you get paid? Ahh... Well, then that'll be the next time I get paid. Well, that makes sense. Look, I'm gonna need those keys. I've got new people coming in at 6:00. I can only give you an hour. Why didn't you call me? Your phone melted. But this is my apartment. No, it's not. That's my bed. Not really. That's my blanket. And the picture on the wall, and the magazine and my shoes. That's my yellow toothbrush. Male African American, early 50s. We don't think he has an address. Fractured skull, partial spinal fracture. We're gonna take care of you. Can I get some blood work and a second IV? I need one liter of bolus. I've got no pulse. He's coding. One amp of Epi. I'll get it. - You're good? - Yeah, I'm good, man. Thanks. Sir? Come on, we gotta get him up. Come with us. We're here to help. I don't need any help. I got you. It's cold. Hold on. Have you done any drugs? Can you remember? I don't do drugs. I'm just cold! Ah, I'm just cold! Why are you wearing that dress? I work here. It's my day job. I'm not dead, am I? They got you just in time. Thank you. Would you like me to take those for you? Sorry? The sandwiches. No, thank you. I'll see you out. I used to work when I was about 17 in a place called Curtis' Curtains. They made some really beautiful things. Drapes. Then... Curtis... ...thought I was stealing, which I wasn't. I just made a mistake with the computer. Did he say he was sorry? No. He didn't. He called the police. Two policemen came. And one of them stayed. That was your father. In his uniform. He didn't arrest me. He just asked me on a date. And we got married not long after that and then you came and... I never needed a new job. What if he finds us again? He is a police officer. And you've been stealing. What do you know about it? Mom... Prada shoes. Those weren't Prada. Those were Florsheim. And they were suddenly just there instead of my old ones. I never steal from anyone it will matter to. You just deserve the best. You deserve to be educated. You should look smart. That way you'll become smart. Yeah. Would you like a pair of these? Yeah, uh... Don't you have any? I probably had some mittens when I was a kid. I don't know. Maybe you can wait to finish until it stops snowing. Yeah, uh... I was gonna finish up real quick and then I'll be done. It's amazing how quickly you've gotten the hang of everything. You think so? Yeah. Forgiveness is here. I gotta head off. - Let's pencil out that. - It's so cold in here. - Okay. - It's so cold in here. No ice. I'm sorry. Our trays are 20 years old. Never any ice. Okay, so let's start. Lloyd? You know, I could bring in some ice cube trays from home next time. Five or six of them. I remember that suggestion we had that you should love thy neighbor before your neighbor loves you, uh, whatever that is. Bonnie. Shouldn't I just go ahead and say the phrase correctly? No. Is there still nobody you like, Marc? No. Come on, Marc. You and me, we're kind of friends, aren't we? You don't count. Obviously not. Some weeks ago, in the restaurant, there was a... A woman. She... No. Great. Now everything falls in place. Shh. What about you, Bonnie? Did you get manage to get through the week without hitting your dog? I think that one's open. But Mom doesn't like churches. But it's warm. Like I said, man, nobody expects you to open up. Me neither. Oh! I'm just about to close the church. Can we just stay for a couple of minutes to warm up? I'm so sorry, I've got to get to my other job at the hospital. Is there a library nearby? There is, but that's about to close too. You guys don't have anywhere else to go, do you? No, we don't. - There's a fold-up bed. - Anthony! Perhaps you can just stay in my office tonight. They close the doors but, uh, Jeff, the volunteer, he'll be here in the morning and open up. Can you help me? - Yes, of course. - Sure. Okay? I'm not supposed to do this. Thank you so much. Alice, can you do a 12-hour shift? I'm understaffed in the morning. Sure. I figured most of the others got kids, and no one's waiting for you. Yeah, of course. Your watch. Jude. Jude? Jude? Jude! Come on. Is he dead? He just won't wake up. Come on. - Take his clothes off. - Anthony, stop it! - I just needed to check his pulse! - Get away from your brother. Oh, my God. I think he has hypothermia. Come on, baby, wake up. Wake up. Careful. Please just leave us alone. Your son's not dead. There's a chance he'll still pull through. Can I see him? Where is he? He's sleeping. Can you just take me back there? We have to wait for the police first. It's protocol. I'm sorry. We called your father. He's on his way. Don't worry. You can't call him! You can't call him! Please tell them, please! You can't call them. Please tell them you can't call the police. I think they already have. If they call my husband... If they call him, he will take my kids. He'll kill them. Do you have any other family? Would you like to just come back to my office at the church? No, he'll find us. We called the ambulance from there. Mom, he'll get you arrested. He'll take Jude. Nobody's gonna take Jude anywhere. I work here, I'm gonna make sure of that. Come here. He wouldn't survive it. Where can I take you? Let me take you somewhere. Somewhere warm? He's in good hands. - You'll take care of him? - Mmm-hmm. You'll make sure he's okay? We're gonna do everything we can. All right? Yeah. It's going to be okay. I've gotta go back to the hospital. But I thought maybe, you know, some coffee or an omelet perhaps. Look, I'm gonna look after your son. You know, if anything changes, I'll find you. Um, sorry. I'm gonna be back in a minute. All right, guys. It's late. We'll finish up tomorrow. Thank you. You did good tonight. Glass? Sorry. So sorry. No, it's fine. You've been sleeping for a long time. I'll go in a minute. Is there anything I can help you with? Just please don't tell anyone that we were here. Is the boy okay? I have two boys. The little one... He's in the hospital. I'm nothing. I'm just a housewife. One day I came home, and my... My husband was beating up my boy, Anthony, because he'd left a spoon by the sink. He'd put him on the dining room table. It must have happened before. The boys had always wanted to go to the city. We slept in the car. Parked in the alley here a few times. I know. In the beginning, I thought he'll just do it to me. The boys would miss him... ...if we left. Why don't you go to the police? My husband is the police. He has so many friends there, he'll find us. Uh, I'm heading home. And if I have to say so myself, the champagne pyramid really worked this time. I thought you were a Russian. Uh, sorry, yeah, no, I grew up here. My advisors tell us to speak with an accent for the sake of the guests. I find it very humiliating, and hands down, my name isn't Timofey, it's just Tim Mortimer. For what it's worth, Irina in the coat check, she isn't Russian either. Her name is Doris. She's from Newark. Not now. Just, just go, please. I'm so sorry. He's nice. Is he? Where were you? Thank you. We won't bother you again. Bathroom? Here we go. Yeah. We should wash up. Hey, Sid. Can I get you a sweater? Sorry. Is that okay? How about some socks? Thanks a lot. Hey. You guys need anything? I'll tell Alice you were here. Lady? Is this your son? He was downstairs in one of those stalls. He was crying so hard I had to break the door. Is this your mom, son? Is she sick? Is there anything I can do for you? No, thank you. Maybe I could get you a cigarette? No. Lady! Lady! Lady, I'm trying to help you. You're looking at me like I'm dirt. You're no better than me. I've got children, too. I had a home. I had insurance! Bill! I had a job! I had a life, lady! Hey! Hey, hey, come on, come on, come on. Come on. - She's not looking at me. - Bill, Bill, all right... She's not looking at me. - Bill, calm down. Calm down. - She doesn't see me! She doesn't see me, Jeff. I see you. Calm down. Okay. She just needs to be left alone. Please, Mom, please just open your eyes. Just open your eyes, please! Don't give up, Mom. Please don't give up. I don't care about the rules. I'm his dad. I'm sorry, it's because of the circumstances. I know, but he needs me. I'm sorry, he's not my patient. I can't just wait here for days. I have to see my son now! Do something, will you? As far as I know, your son has had a shock, but he's better now, and I have an emergency. I'll have someone look into it. So, please, just stay right here. Can you grab that? Hello, Alice. Look... You can stay at my place. It's in the top floor of the building where I work. Okay. Come on. Come on. There's a bedroom over there. I usually sleep in here anyway. Here are the keys. Thank you. Is there a computer? You can use mine. Where are your normal things? I don't really have any things. Everything was just here. I'll show you where you can sleep. Don't touch her! Leave her alone! Anthony! Anthony, stop! Stay away from my family! - He's not gonna hurt us. - Done. Anthony. Leave us alone. Leave us... Alone. Look, it's better than sleeping under the piano. Are you cold? Sit here. You don't like it here, do you? I like it. I just don't think it's for me anymore. I'll be right back. Hello, Alice! Hi, Timofey. Can I take your coat? No, I've got my uniform on. I mean, um... You don't have to put on a Russian accent. I'm an ER nurse. I've seen everything. Long day, short boyfriend. Yeah, this is Jude, he's a patient at my hospital. I'm hoping that I might find his mom here. Well, most of our guests arrive quite late. This is a first-class restaurant now, it's not Starbucks. I know, but Marc, your manager, I talked to him earlier, and I think she might be hiding here with her other son. - She has two sons? - Yeah. So the bigger one is not an only child? That's a relief, because they can be absolutely dreadful. So she's here. In confidence? Try the top floor. You have to go through the kitchen. Can you call her and have her come down because I have to get back to the hospital and discharge him? Okay. - Yeah? Thank you. - Yeah. Would you like to, uh, see the menu? Would you like me to find your mother? Oh! I'm sorry. Jeff. I was just... I was just here... ...in case they came back. Keep a lookout. Is the kid all right? Yeah, he's okay. I got him discharged. Is he with his mom? Yeah. Jeff, are you hungry? I could eat. Please say something. I know you don't wanna talk to anyone. But maybe you could talk to me. You know, my parents gave me this wristwatch when I graduated. My dad was so proud he went and showed everyone in the neighborhood. It's pretty. You need it for your job. Weren't you supposed to work tonight? Would you like a vodka? I don't, uh... I don't have any money. I'll get it. Can we have two vodkas? Uh, sure. Russian Standard? Then I don't have to go to the stock room. Sure. Make 'em doubles. Sure. You don't have anyone you need to get home to? Well, not really, no. I... Six years ago, my parents died within a year of each other and I'd moved out to take care of them and took leave from the hospital. When I came back, my boyfriend had found someone new. Was he sleeping with her? Jeff... Sorry. So, um, what... Thank you. Well, what about... What about you then? I haven't been with anyone since. Four years now. I thought people that had jobs at hospitals had, you know, all kinds of things going on. All those beds. Not in my hospital. I don't even know if I'd remember how. Alice... I know I'm not your type of, you know... Person or, you know, whatever, and you're not really my... I don't have a type, really. But you've been so kind to me, I'd be happy, you know... You know, to... Just once or twice, you know, so you got the... So you found your way back to it. An afternoon when the children's orchestra is gone or something. Are you thinking in the music room? On the piano? No, I thought we could put some cushions on the floor. No, that's okay, but I... Thank you, though. Yeah. It's the least I can do. I'm not gonna go to work tomorrow. How come? I'm just not good with people anymore, Jeff. Yes, you are. The Forgiveness group, you help those people. They help themselves. You're kind to them. You are kind to them. Even when they're not. I'm not someone people get close to. I'm no one's numero uno. Is that Italian? Yeah. Bye. Hi. Hey. I thought you were sleeping. The boys are. How is Jude? The same. Anthony was on your computer all day. Yeah. Would you like to go out? Now? Yeah. Just for a walk. Kids are safe. You must feel trapped in here. I can't. Anthony gets nightmares. Besides, I like it in here. This isn't a prison. No, it's not. If we were going to go out, where would we go? Where would you like to go? Hmm, not too far. I would take you quickly to Canal Street. We would cross that, and then we'd slow down. When we'd reached West Village, I... I think I would have waited so long for you to take my hand that I would try to take yours. Hmm. Forgiveness, is that you? You know, it's not on today, but, um... I have a leaflet here. I'm not looking for forgiveness. I'm looking for my son. Jude Brand? The hospital told me he's gone. You're Alice, right? Uh, there's a children's orchestra on Thursdays. My son doesn't play. I'm looking for my other son, too, Anthony. And my wife. You work in that emergency ward, don't you? They say his mom must have picked him up. Did you see them? No. I mean... I don't know. I don't know. I don't think you should lie to me. Why would I lie? This is a church. Would you like me to call the police for you? No, no, no, I don't think you should. I love my wife. I love my sons. I don't think you understand what love is. I don't think anybody loves you. Okay, you're good. You want a mirror? No, I'm okay. - Good. - Thanks. You want me to cut your hair, too? Mom? Mmm-hmm? What will it take for us to go home? That Dad goes to jail? I don't know. I think so. When we were home, I was on his computer and I saw some photos he had. Just leave it alone. Read a book or something. Mom, it wasn't just police photos. People being beat up. I've been trying to find them. What are you talking about? That's Marc's computer. It's not on here, they're on Dad's computer. And, you know, I've been trying to connect to Dad's computer but it won't let me, so I can't show you. Like, I can't. It was horrible. I mean, torture and stuff. Like what he did to us. Do you know a lawyer? Yeah. - John Peter, Clara. - Hi. Nice to meet you. Hi. It's right through there. I'll be right with you. Thanks. Far above your standard. - She's just a friend. - You don't have any friends. Okay, I don't. What's that? - It's a chair. - Really? Thank you. My assistant found it on the street, and she insists I keep it 'til she finds a boyfriend. She says it's retro. So you like her? She's 26 years old. She thinks I'm retro, too. Plus I... May be falling for someone else. Ah! - Someone I know? - Yeah. Yeah, you'll leave us to it? Oh, I'll leave you to it. Um, have we met before? I don't think so. I'm a friend of Marc's. Hmm. Have a seat. Well? So, um... Hello. Is there an... The Plaintiff shall be awarded... "His uncle came in..." Back in five. Yeah, Phil, just give me a minute. There's a church she goes to. Leave a message. Tell her to come see you, that she's forgiven. I can't stop that trial. She's not gonna come see me. All she wants is money, okay? Please, Dad! I need to take care of my sons. I need her to stop that lawyer. It's gone too far. She has a soft spot for you. She's unreliable. She left home when she was a kid and now she's leaving you. She's flaky! She's not gonna win. Please, would you just do it? I don't... Oh! Ah! Ah! Stop! Ah! This time was not quite as hopeless. See you next Thursday. It's nice. A little orchestra. Yeah, it's pretty nice. You wanna sit down? I'm not sure where to begin. You've been calling in sick for weeks. I know. I'm so, so sorry. For the love of God, I am a head nurse. You look just fine. Is this where the soup kitchen is run from? Yeah. And the support group. Management asked me to come find you. It's not just you. The staff is worn out. They can't very well ask us to turn patients away. Can I tell them you'll be back next week? I don't think I can do that job anymore. What will you live on? I don't know. Soup. Sorry. Maybe I can ask the hospital to fund your group. Really? People are grateful, I hear. Except the ones who complain there's a waiting list. There's a waiting list? Yes. Um... Well, will you put in a good word? I'll try. Thank you. - Goodnight, Jack. - Goodnight. Are you busy? No, no. Not at all. The boys are asleep? Mmm-hmm. Have you heard from John Peter? It turns out, someone found my father-in-law lying on the floor of his apartment. His girlfriend... She got him to a hospital. They think my husband beat him up, so... Now they're offering the boys and me a place to stay. So, you're moving? Tomorrow. We can't go home until after the case is settled. Will you be staying in the city? I don't know. They won't tell us the address. It's confidential. I have to take care of my boys. Follow me. Thank you. Why have you put small spoons on every single place setting? Did you do that in kindergarten or are you trying to force people to order caviar? Don't you see how rude that is? Don't you think people should have a chance to decide for themselves? Sorry. It's completely up to you if you want people to have spoons or not. I'm sorry. Yeah, no, you, you, you may have a point there. It's actually a little tactless to just assume without... I should have seen that. Don't I have eyes in my head? Look, I'm, I'm, I'm the one who's sorry. I'm grateful for what you do at this place. It's going great. Again, I prefer not to discuss anything that has to do with business. But I have been more worried than I realized about... ...not being able to keep the place. It shouldn't be a problemovich. Will she be coming back? I don't think so. Goodnight. Can you ask her to? And the kind little boys? I don't even know where they are. Do you wanna sleep in my bed? It's not your bed. No, it's not. You're nothing like him. Neither is Jude. Neither of you have anything bad in you. I want to kill him. If we win this, he's gonna go to jail, I think, for a very long time. You're gonna grow up and you'll forget him. But what if he wins? I had no idea how much we owed. I just put all the bills in my bowling bag. Huh. And my wife loves shopping. I mean, I think we had 100 tea pots in my home and we mostly just drink coffee. Uh, she even bought one that was made to look like Saint Peter's Cathedral. Can we stay on topic? We've got one like that. Can we stay on topic, please? Right. Uh... I think I'll forgive myself next Tuesday. Yeah, you said that last Tuesday. Who's next? John Peter... You hardly ever speak. I'm an attorney. I'm sworn to confidentiality. Not about yourself. I have no problems. Not enough sex, but... I assume everyone else in this room shares the same problem. Speak for yourself. Yeah, Bonnie, I'm sure you're on fire in bed. Well, still waters can run deep. Very deep, Lloyd. Why can't you just be kind? Terrible things happen, and some of you have nobody to turn to. But you have strangers. Why can't you be more careful? More compassionate. And you two, you sit there and you don't talk and you take up space. Well, not you, John Peter. You've actually been... You've been terrific. You've been very kind. But the rest of you... What gives you the right to be unkind? Shut up, Bonnie. What? That was so helpful! John Peter and Marc, could you stay? Firstly, forgive me. - Of course. - Absolutely. There's a waiting list for the group, and I hope we're moving to the hospital. So I think you guys should stop coming. Oh. Well... I'm only here for his sake. I'm only here for his sake and for you. Um... Ah. I'm gonna go for a smoke. Good. In that case, um... Are you free to come here on Sunday night? Yes, I am. Um, any special reason? No special reason, just now you're not my client anymore. Um, I can invite you to dinner. Rock and roll. That's the first time I've ever used that expression. Whoo! Will Alice be there? Yes, it was her idea. And she is going to cook for us. Will Marc? No. Come on, you'll sit over here. Thank you so much for having us. The boys were so excited. I'm so glad that you came. Nice to see you. When everyone is seated, I'll get some chairs. Okay. They're a little wet, though. - Hi. - Hi. - Oh! - It's just, yeah, I'll... Oh, hi. Have you heard anything? No, I'm sorry. No word yet. - No word? - I'm sorry. - You all right, Jeff? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Say hi to John Peter. - Ah! Hi. How are you? So, uh, Jeff has been cooking all day and it looks incredibly delicious. It looks great. Which corner, which corner, which corner? Any. Okay. This one. This got... This got good potato. I've got it, Jeff. I've got it. Mmm-mmm. - Uh... - What's wrong? Forgive me for being a bit gauche, but, uh... In case we need to eat someplace else, um, I know a place. That would be great. Beautiful, Marc. Beautiful work. You found a way to make Russian food delicious. This Prince Igor salad, is this what Brezhnev ate in the '80s, the early '80s? Shut up. It was delicious. I like the caviar. Oh, guys, it can be Brezhnev's favorite meal and still be delicious. That was wonderful. Anthony, have some more. Maybe later. Jeff, can we get some ice cream? Yeah. You want me to go get it, though? Unless you want to. Why don't you hang out, hang out if you want. I mean, you worked a long day today, and... I got kicked out of my therapy group so I could, uh, I could use someone to chat with. So when is your case decided? Uh, next week, they think. If it goes well, we can go home. John Peter's been amazing. Oh, yes, he is. The day he won my case, I wanted to take him to dinner, so we came to this place. The investors happened to be here. We drank all night, and the next day I had the job. It's the concert hall. Mmm. I like this place. And I like you. It's gonna be hard to say goodbye to you again. I think we should do it now. Goodbye. Goodbye. Come, sit down. Uh, we won. Your husband is going away for a very long time. You're safe now, it's over. You can go home. You can go anywhere. How am I ever gonna thank you? Oh, I intend to bill you substantially. I have a girlfriend now who eats caviar the way the rest of us eat frosted flakes. - Alice? - Yeah. She's a monster. Where's Dad's computer? They confiscated it. I'd like to change schools where they don't know me and Jude. We could move. To the city. We could live close to the library. It would have to be a really small apartment. That doesn't matter to me. We could sell the car, then. We could get you a computer. If you wanted, we could get one of those really big ones. With a box under the desk. Just a small one is fine, thanks, Mom. - You sure? - Yeah. We should probably stay here, though, for Jude. It'd be better for him. Mom? Yeah? When Dad said I had to hit Jude... Yeah? Jude said he could see why I did it. He'd have done the same thing if he'd been the older brother. So he forgave me. So you should forgive yourself, too. Mom? We should move. I can call you back at six o'clock. All right, bye. Hi, everyone. I'm Alice. Forgiveness is this way. Just follow me. Bonnie, will you introduce everyone? And I'm Bonnie. Peter. That's Marcus. Carol. Jonathan. Sita. JJ. Carrie. Ola. Your receipt is in the bag. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Na zdorovye. Na zdorovye. Spasiba. Thank you. - Take care of the place. - I will. Clara... I owe you a lot of money for rent and everything else. I can pay you now. No, you don't have to. Things are going very well here. We hired a new doorman. Jeff. He's not helping people park, is he? Good. Are the boys at school? Not far from here, actually. It's for you. Thanks. You're not very good at getting presents, are you? Usually, no. What is it? Swimming trunks. I thought we could go to the beach. Now? At some point. Give me ten minutes. If you could just stand out there, you know, you'll get the hang of it in no time. Should I help people in and out of the taxis? No, they can do that for themselves. Should I say hello to them? No, they can do that for themselves, too. I mean, if they insist, you speak with a Russian accent, okay? Rushklenov. That sort of thing, yeah. You want me to play this? Could you if you had to? Sure. Okay. Give it a shot.
