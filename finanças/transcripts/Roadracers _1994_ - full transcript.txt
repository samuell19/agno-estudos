Want a tamale with that shake? Hello, JT. Sarge... What do I owe you, JT? Thank you. JT, do not give special treatment to this thug. Are you a business, or you take it as a business, or you were in the street before resorting to the Ministry of Health. My thing is to feed people, Sergeant, keep the thugs at bay is up to you. You better be devoted to each his own. That's the spirit, JT! You shut up! Yes Got a minute? Sure. Well, you might seem a little sudden, but... I want to say that I like what you do. Thank you. How did you do that? Fact what? Well, that... I mean... that the world is not very easy for those who want to do things differently. Well I started playing, and went with it. Nothing special. - Do you smoke? - Yes... yes Look at this, JT. From here... to Eternity is the time before I was born. And from here to Eternity... is the time after I die. And this... is all the time that I have... to use it. You do nothing. You'll spend the rest of your days here in this town. And you will die here... with my burger in hand. And nothing more. I want you to know that in my group have good news and bad news. We have signed a record label to take on tour. - And the good news? - That's the good news. - Ah... well... what's the bad? - Gone is the guitarist. - Why? - Because it was not the time or something. Did you say you play? If you think we can help, you should do a test. If it goes well you could do the tour. There is a lot of money. Enough for 2 people to live? Sure. Hey, I think you do because you know that everyone is covered in shit. If... I'm sick of all these people who have success being a real shit. Look, I want to make music... to affright staff. If... I understand. That same train came to me long ago, and I lost. This time will not go without me. Our last show is tomorrow. Come if you think you can fill the gap. Okay... thanks. Uncle!, A record... a tour. Forget all this... I never have an opportunity like that. Girls... women... fame and fortune. If... not say anything to Donna, yet nothing is certain. It might be jinxed. No... I do not want to get your hopes up, in case it does not work. Well... if you need rep or something... not... someone to help you... and if I have other commitments... Shit... I will not go without you. - Do you want to go see that movie tonight? - I can not. Is it Donna? Are you sure you want to date someone like Dude? Yes It's that one day his father was caught and we are scared to do the same. Donna, just think about your future... as good parents. And with no one to guide him, we fear that it can not give everything you expect from a man. Dude I know things you do not know any of your friends gossip. Like what? As it is a good musician... going to have a group going to sign a record deal, and earn so much money that will suck. Well, if that happens you will have our blessing. I already said. But if not, I want you to be prepared to look at other options. - Oh!... This will look that good. - If... Go body! I assure that you'll get later I can. Ah... this jumps a lot, right? It is good idea but jumps every time we caught a pothole. Well... What we do tonight? Whatever you want, Donna. I like the dark. I want to go see... a movie. Want to watch a movie with me? For my Dudi whatever. What do you want to go see? Thank you, Donna. How many times have you seen this movie? 15. Why do not you tell me that you had left your father? Never tell me anything. There is nothing you have to know about me that I have not counted. I want to hear about your father. From my father just got a thing. What? Better not to know. Fight,... in the park... tonight... at 9. Where children play, Teddy? They will not miss. I love to jump rope with you, but I have an appointment. It's settled, goes to your appointment. I already atizare other day, not tonight. With that hot chick got that quote? Surely not this whore with which you. With this Mexican whore. We are Like the music, right? The cockroach... cockroach... Is a Mexican song, right Donna? Did you know that you were throwing a cockroach? Leave her out of this. Why? You would have burned my girlfriend's hair, so bud! You think I'm going to leave you alone like that? Fuck you in the ass! Tonight... at 9... At 9. I'm sure you are. Are you are going through a bit, is not it? - What have been those now? - Teddy wants to dance. I thought that was the police. Yeah right... is the police, but... Do you not understand?, Can not trust anyone. They've taken over the entire city. How the hell warn others if there's no one? Fuck!, You can not even trust his girlfriend. Well,... and when he learns that the girl is one of them? When she kisses him. Whenever you hear well, right? When it's late... So are they... girls. Listen to me, guys. I have lived much longer than you. Do you think a child dreamed of making burgers for scum like you? You have to know you want to do. And above all... when. Because the time is important. If not, you realize, as the guy in the movie, that... fuck... it's too late. We ask you something. What do you think it gives impression that the son of Sergeant... is the village idiot? Huh? I'll tell you. People say that you can skip the laws. You know... my laws. Because apparently you can not handle a thug dirty and disgusting. - I told you I will. - Yes?, How? I challenged him to a fight tonight. I have the kids ready if comes up with something. Everyone knows it's a hook. You'll have to work hard to fuck at all. Listen... Not because I had a problem with his father long ago. Got it?" I have my reasons for putting a broth. You know, son? If excuses were worth cents... you'd be a fucking silver dollar. Do not forget to put this in my hand when I'm dead. "Who knows what the devil looks in the human heart" "The Shadow knows" - Dudi? - Hey, baby! Come here, I have to talk to you. - What happens? - Sit. You know that group you like? They are looking for a guitarist. - Yes, I have heard some comment. - Is our chance! - What do you mean? - Have signed a record deal. And are your style, do not touch anything sweet. Now!, But I have to think about my mother. Listen! If you had wanted to go somewhere ask me to leave my parents. Yeah, well... but not the same, they are not your real parents, are not your own blood. Do not go to the fight tonight, Dude... please. Come to the club, show them what you do. Worth a try. We will not have another chance like this. Please... You promise you're going to try? "Please! I promise you. Ready to machacarles? Yes, very well. Teddy has gone too far. I spoke to the club. I was talking about the fight. Did not you hear anything I said JT? Yes, I... an uncle very deep. Dude, fuck the fight, the only chance to get out of here. Why waste it with Teddy? My father never faced with anything in his sad life. One was dedicated to flee. And I'm not going to flee. Neither Teddy nor pig of his father, or anyone else. Do you have the brass knuckles? - Oh, yes. Do you think it will? At least that appears with this Donna. You know that I like fair fights. Meddle not, assholes... is all mine. Lately you have not hit very hard. Want to see how you swallow that comment? Just saying... Apparently that made you all a cocoon. You were lucky. And the hair of my sister? Then what are you gonna do, Teddy? Would you let your face like a finely chopped raw hamburger? If... that and much more. Its true that I do nothing of myself, but I dont get in trouble. People do not want to know anything about you. It's exactly what I want,... so do not bother me. Look, Dude... have forced me to be. And you have forced... give me one. You'd fuck not no crabs in a whorehouse. Oh, very well. Ten reflections! Sorry, Dude. - It's okay. - But... Stay away! This if... which is stronger!... We're here waiting asshole face. That guy is not going to appear. Hey, where are you going? It's too chicken to come... we go. I love it when you play out of tune! Quarter's 11! I know you hate this city, you hate Teddy, I also... But I also know how you like your music. Fight for what you like... not for what you hate. Well, what are you gonna do? Clubbing... and machacarles. Need a lift? Hey, hey! They put a record spinning! It is a fraud!, Is a fraud!, A fraud!, A fraud!, Fraud! You bastards!... They were playing a fucking fag. Music, Dude... it was just that... just music. A great fuck! You did not have to, we had a chance and you fucked up as ever. You're selfish, Dude. I give a shit about my dreams. Those dreams are mine, not yours. You get one. Asshole." Now your father if you're going to be okay to broth, Teddy. No, Teddy!... yes Here we are... Cursed chickenshit. It's time... once you start. Fuck off with your shotgun cartridges! Do you really think I would have to buy the chocolates? But if you're too fat. I think with the petunias enough... and even perhaps - Mustard? - Eh, sorry... what? Do you want the dog with or without mustard? Sarge Con love the mustard. Get in the fucking car... we go! But do not want to eat? Get in the fucking car now! Add all at once! - Where are you going, Dude? - Looking for Donna. A Teddy something happened. They say he is dead... Take me with you, Dude. You have to start following only your way. What I do here? If I'm not in trouble, I go crazy. You spend what you better looking than me mounting them. What will you do? Living in the streets, with all the garbage... People throw many good things. They're hung... What are you doing, dude? Say you do not think we will go skating, Donna. I want to help. No can help me. I will not ever believed that I am a problem. I can not go with you, Dude. It's all... you're better off without me. What remained of me? A dim image in a mirror... Faster!... catch that son of a bitch! Damn... This time will not get away, you bastard! We... to end this... now. I should have fucking long. I'm going to kill you, fucking asshole. Check the brake! Check the brake! About the camera a little. To see wait a little, soon followed. The mother who bore! Sometimes it can seem as hard as you want!
