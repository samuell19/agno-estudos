Send Midhat once he's arrived They've sent an ultimatum, Majesty How long do we have? Two days Why not open the gates to the people? Address the people Denounce the leaders of Ittihat Everyone will be behind you You're so young, Izzet I will never let it be said that I led my people to civil war Midhat Aga What's happened? Tell me With your permission May I withdraw, Madame? I'd lost hope, Nadir I'm almost done The Sultan dismissed Izzet Pasha He must decide before dawn I have two pages to finish Did you hear what I said? This is probably the last night What ending does he want? Voiletta survives... So why are you worried? The Sultan likes happy endings Let me just finish this It's time to lock the doors He must have it tonight He won't read it tonight You decide for His Majesty now? I don't feel up to it tonight Let someone take my place Gulfidan, come tell us a story What can I tell? I don't know How can I, since you're here? I've never done this before I won't be able to Water and fire Shadow and light day and night are like youth and old age They seem so different but in fact, they're not Youth is the past of old age Old age is the future of youth A new girl arrived in the Harem The Agas asked her to wait and left her alone in a room She was tired. She was frightened So looked around She knew nothing of this world which she had entered perhaps for ever She looked around She glanced at a divan more beautiful than the others She decided to sit down But once she had she heard an order Away from there For the divan belonged to an old favorite whose last day it was in the Harem She was waiting for the boat that was to bring her to the Palace of Tears Both women were waiting But for different voyages One was arriving, the other departing Suddenly, the door opened A cold wind invade the room Good night There they were, sitting unable to ignore each other I don't know who spoke first They exchanged some polite words The older woman said I have no advice to give you but remember this Within these walls three things are essential love power and fear Nervous, the younger woman asked Love for His Majesty? The favorite said no What we feel for him is adoration The same adoration we owe Allah in this world and the next It's not the love you speak of that fire which consumes the heart and banishes sleep One cannot love His Majesty like that Unawares, the woman began to talk about her life in the Harem The only life she had every known Fire! The Sultan's atelier is burning Fire! Fire! Hurry, we must save the novices What demon took hold of you? My love for you, my Lord Take her away Let no one look at her as she leaves Who are you? Her name is Safiye Was she your friend? No, Majesty As of today it is forbidden to leave the Palace forbidden, evenings on the Boshporus Forbidden, carriage rides Forbidden, strolls in the gardens Our enemies are more numerous and closer than we think than we think We can trust no one Have you seen Selma's jewels? And her dress? Marvelous. A French tailor made it The one in the Palace? It's a beautiful color You are very pale, Safiye Didn't you sleep well? What's it to you? She slept fine Don't listen to her It's dangerous to call attention to yourself Dangerous to call attention to yourself You're jealous His Majesty never even notices you His Majesty won't notices you either I'm not from Hungary I was brought up for him Why hasn't he summoned you? His atelier has burned He has time for you Maybe he wants you old, like him Watch your tongue! He isn't old Don't insult him I'm insulting you! Stop! The fire wasn't enough? Shall I turn you in? Safiye, go to the baths I'm eating Eat later Welcome You bring us joy Enter Don't be shy Come. Have a seat You don't want to sit? You're not going to eat standing? I'll sit when my host has arrived It that case, you may sit Do you also think I did it on purpose? If I wanted to be noticed it wasn't be the Sultan It was done spontaneously She was one of us Do you know why she did it? Everyone knows Gulfidan, please I don't like your expression I don't either But my face has a will of its own The Sultan loves us all He shares his love with all Ayse made a mistake She fell in love with him She wanted him all to herself When he stopped seeing her she burnt what was dearest to him Is she banished? The Sultan will let her marry a guard What cruel punishment She'll never see him again It's stupid to disobey the rules Everyone here should know that The first rule is to master one's feelings If they go against his desires I haven't disobeyed I never even spoke with Ayse Was I speaking of you? Am I here to be scolded? No I wanted to know you better Would you wanted to if I hadn't helped her? But you did She's Italian Her parents sold her when she was 8 We don't know her birth date A French ship brought her to Cairo where she was bought Abdul Pasha offered her to your son the Sultan She can read and write three languages The moon Has the eclipse already taken place Midhat? I am Nadir Tiem as passed and your eyes have mellowed, Midhat I am not Midhat Tell me when the eclipse begins One monent Enter, Safiye From what I've heard your tutor did not teach you well Espeically when you eat with your fingers Fingers are the source of all refinement Next time be more careful, Nadir Aga Don't waste my time with well brought up girls Our Safiye is as perfect as the Sultan's mother can desire I see a long road then a wide gate Beware the evil eye Gulbahar, it's my turn Wait, Nimet. Safiye first Not now I warn you I will not undergo one more test You don't trust me? You lie too well You pretended you had no table manners We're even You don't understand me You're perfect only when it suits you Careful Why pretend to be my friend then test me? I'm not pretending I must be sure That I'm worthy of your attention? Not of mine A century ago Sultana Esma adored English furniture and comfort Anything old or Oriental was sent up here She'd take this boat in search of boys to quench her desire Everyone knew her boat with its cargo of splendid boys She dominated them all on her throne, or standing like a bird in flight in search of prey When she'd chosen one she brought him back to her palace after one night of love she had his throat cut She was not a favorite nor an odalisque She was the sister of Mahmud II No woman of the harem ever had such power unless she became the mother of the next Sultan thus becoming herself the Valide But that road was long and fraught with peril You need a protector as companion a man of trust I'm not the favorite He's already asked about you Unselfish friendship doesn't exist here I wanted someone with whom I'd feel myself Different from others I can offer you much more Close your eyes I can offer you this Look Fear not, no one can see us I cannot Please, close that door Be my companion and I'll be your true friend You'll become his favorite mother of his children The Sultan approached the closet with the lovers inside and brusquely opened the door But the closet was empty The dagger slipped from his hands He fell to his knees before such a miracle Allah has sent three apples One for the teller of the tale another for the listener and the last one for me Do whatever you like here To change the furniture, just say so No one must know I've given you this An opera Translate it for the Sultan It's difficult, but you can Listen to the music. You'll see We must stand fast now The woman told her how His Majesty fell in love with her He called for her not only at night but also by day Together they listened to the music they loved Whenever music echoed through the Palace everyone knew she was with the Sultan A shadow follows you A woman's shadow Another, still larger, follows It is the shadow of a mob But little by little I see the shadows give way In the end, you will have peace Very good Only two mistakes You're making progress Delicious, Gulfidan I didn't bring them Did you, Karanergiz? You must be vigilant There are two of you Nadir Nadir Can you wake up? I'm worried about Sumbul He's disappeared Halit is over there Halit You're looking for me? What's wrong? Have you seen Sumbul? Why would he be here? People said he was Maybe they think he's about to join the army? He shouldn't go out at night I swear he's not here All right, Halit. Forgive me Come back, Sumbul No one find out Why did Midhat involve you in this? This has nothing to do with Midhat This is between Halit and me What! You don't have to please him because you're not a man I'm doing it only for myself Don't talk nonsense! We're the same No, we are not the same I'm in love Gulfidan found them under my bed The third time I'll have them burned How do they get into my suite? It drives me mad I'm afraid to be alone even in the hammam You're never alone there Even for my mud bath I send for Gulfidan It's not very wise to meet here All eyes are on you Did this belong to Sultana Esma too? I don't know If it was her wedding gown it brought bad luck The eunuchs lived outside the Harem In fact those who survived sastration came to the Palace to be educated They said that even Cairo's black markets had forbidden the sale of emasculated African boys I am happy that you came Before you go to Egypt stop in Istanbul, for my sake Think of me I don't know if I will Anyway, what do I care where I go? As long as I travel... What are you running from, Anita? We weren't talking about me Don't change the subject I'm jealous of certain memories If I put them into words they may escape and never return I don't want them to abandon me too You have nothing to say? Yes, but n an unknown language that has no dictionary She too is Italian And she also knows music She sings very well and she plays three instruments Much time was spent in teaching her the art of love She was brought up in secrecy Perfect Just as planned We can still give up We mustn't run any risks Leave me alone with her We have to finish preparing her Withdraw As you wish, Madam Stay Don't be afraid I won't harm you You're Italian? What's your name? Aliye Aliye... Let me spend the night with him and they're yours I don't need them I'll have the same tomorrow These are not the gifts of one night Do you think it will last? I can't Look at me All these jewels for one night And so it was The girl drank up the old woman's words just like all o fyou right now The young woman was curious to know whether Safiye made it to His Majesty's side Just as you'd like to know. She did When his Majesty saw her, he said I didn't call for you, he told me I know, I said but this night is mine. I bought it He looked at me, stunned with a certain pleasure and said, from whom? I murmured From the girl you were expecting Excuse me your train will be 20 minutes late Thank you I'm tired of talking Tell me about yourself No, please We have so little time left Go on, please With your permission Aliye is dead Poor thing Poor creature What happened? We've heard she drowned in the Bosphorus His Majesty couldn't have ordered that Of course not It wasn't His Majesty Everyone thinks you had her murdered Help me, Gulfidan Give me my clothes Are you feeling unwell, Safiye? No. I'm fine Thank you for your kindness We weren't expecting you They said you were tired that you hadn't slept Some halva in honor of the deceased? Safiye Magnificent necklace I received it today Say he's ugly to ward off the evil eye Safiye, come here Come sit next to me Let me see your face You have beautiful hands You smoke? Young women shouldn't ruin their hands Why are you so silent? I wanted to think you for letting Osman stay with me You're sentimental That's why you were chosen as my son's music advisor You like opera? I hate it I hate theater What purpose does it serve? To dream Other peole's lives? I dream my own life and that's boring enough Do you like stars? Have you ever seen an eclipse? That's when the moon masks the sun Night takes its revenge on day It's our revenge the revenge of women Is my son handsome? Of course Describe him Can't you see him? When I close my eyes I can't remember his face Open them and come play You want me? We demand you There's your mama Going to Bursa? It's unbelievable It's an important mission Amber used to go I'm happy for you We'll all miss you It's just three days Osman... Osman I'm here. Gulfidan What happened? Don't worry What happened to my baby? Help! Help! Help! Help me! Children... just speaking of them can bring joy as it can bring sorrow Sorrow feeds on silence The old woman fell silence The young woman dared not speak You know you can't see him They're good doctors He needs me He'll get better His heart problem isn't serious Stop torturing yourself Every sorrow has its remedy Every poison, its antidote What do you mean? Who poisoned him? Who'd poison the Sultan's son? No one, clam down I didn't mean that Who'd dare? Who poisoned him? How malicious Stop, Madam Call Midhat immediately How dare you come in here? It's alright I was coming to see you Don't torture yourself Allah willed it I beg you. Have pity on me for your own children's sake I can do nothing to end your suffering Give me the antidote I'll forgive you Please, get up Antidote? What do you mean? Make him live I beseech you Tell me what to do You know the truth Safiye has disappeared You must find her Safiye... I wanted you to see him Forgive me, Safiye Don't weep, Safiye Death does not exist Death does not exist... From then on there was an unspoken pact between me, the Sultan and the Harem The very walls seemed to respect my sorrow I had been granted a sort of immunity the price of my grief and my tears In the name of what should I spare you? In the name of this document I bring for your signature, Majesty Sign this constitution and all will remain as before By dawn the Sultan had signed the constitution For eight months all went on as before But in fact it was the beginning of the end Are they taking us very far? Not that far It's very beautiful Don't you want to go on holiday? Midhat says we're going there forever Midhat always loves to joke around Why isn't he coming too? He's staying to watch the house Aren't you, Midhat? A word from you would suffice To whom, Midhat? If only I knew to whom He's taking me with him to Thessaloniki What a great honor for you You deserve it I can't leave you Have you the choice? Sumbul will tend to you I'll be back. I promise The Sultan's desire is our command It outweighs even your promises I could feel you were suffering I'm sorry I'll never forgive myself You will You're the one who's alone She's staying with him Between them, there will always linger a trace of this suffering Time heals all wounds You'll be able to start a new life when the pain of parting is no more than a memory How did you manage to be so strong? Who says I was strong? Inside there were rare silks from India There were also robes embroidered with precious stones and table topped with a thousand and one delicacies Wealth abounded The Sultan said to the young woman All this is yours Tell me. What else do you want? Don't worry. Stay calm In the name of the law the Harem is now closed You may rejoin your families You had to break in here to tell us that? We bring you freedom Freedom? What freedom? To die of hunger and cold? No one takes care of us anymore In order to send you to your families we need your names and those of your relatives If was have no family? We'll work it out You're no longer prisoners While we're here, no one may enter It's the law The law can wait outside They'll tell you what you what We have the right not to be offended by your eyes Everyone out Get us the necessary information We'll do what the law requires Come Gulbahar We can't leave without you Your relatives are coming They'll find a place for everyone They promised We'll all have a home. They promised Promises, promises... Allah help us Do you want something, dear? Durisehvar! Durisehvar What do they want? Nothing Then why do they want you? They're offering room and board Only for the young Nevres is leaving Nevres Nevres Nevres I didn't want this to happen I didn't want...

Such was hers Don't torture yourself like this You look frozen, Nadir Come closer to the fire How is His Majesty? Who's taking care of him? How Sama? Everybody leaves! So many men have been sacrificed Who are these people To you You never went out while living with the countess? Sometimes, rarely... afternoons I dared not look around I felt all Istanbul staring at me Careful, Safiye Nadir? Why are you here? Don't you know it's forbidden to be out? We're hunting for dogs It's dangerous to be out? The lady is with me I was showing her home We got lost in the fog You're from the Palace Hurry home Tonight the streets won't be safe This way It may have been the last stray dog in the city All the others had been captured They took them to a deserted island Day after day the wind brought from aftar their echoing barks Then, suddenly, the city was enveloped in an ominous silence Someone wnet out to the island The dogs had devoured each other Not one had wanted to survive its race Following her triumphs in Paris, London and Berlin we present you the loveliest flower of the Sultan's Palace Only a short time ago, she lived enclosed with in forbidding walls guarded by fearsome black eunuchs A slave amongst the slaves! A master of almost godlike power I promised you a "Night in the Harem" You'll get much more She's going to dance for you She'll sing for you She will reveal the secrets the mysteries of her life and of her forbidden loves Introducing the Pearl of the Orient The Last Favorite Sublime Safiye Italy, October 29, 1923 Did you work long in music hall? You never found your family? What have you done since? I have just grown old Your train is coming Thank you I have to check my baggage I'll be back to say goodbye Look what's arrived. Maybe... No, it's from Karanergiz Dear Madam and invaluable benefactress light of my eyes Unfortunately, I bring sad tidings With the harem Agas who remained we struggled against our misfortune For some time, our dear Nadir Aga had been growing somber One day he disappeared We sought him everywhere We learned he was victim of an accident at Kiziltoprak Our Nadir had breathed his last, crushed under a train Oh light of my eyes I tried to sort his things He'd left them all in order The amulet he wore around his neck was in a box on his bed My God I'd rather be struck blind than bear such news Madam I would give my life to console you I kiss your beautiful hands I kiss your eyes, my benefactress And Nadir? Nadir... You've said no more about Nadir I never saw him again But I've heard form him I letter from time to time He's happy now His dream has come true He married a widow with two sons He's founded a family You never tried to see him again? You're still waiting for him? You have beautiful hands, Anita Young women shouldn't ruin them Here Don't refuse It's a souvenir... Only a souvenir Two ships in the night they were about to part forever The young woman asked Instead of advice why tell me the story of your life? The old woman smiled Then she answered Always remember this... and these were her final words What's important is not how you live your life but how you tell it To yourself and others In that way alone will you make sense of errors of suffering and death Allah sent three apples from on high One for the teller One for the listener and the last for the heroes of our tale
