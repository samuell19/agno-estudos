He who could not, who did not dare take risks when it was needed has no right to complain about the mediocrity of his existence Saint Exupéry Under the Sign of the Voodoo My name is Codjo. It's my story I'm about to tell you. It happened here, in Dahomey. In my memory, everything began with my initiation. That day, I affirmed my bonds with the other members of my community. And all together, in accordance with our tradition, we renewed our pact with the voodoos. Lacoë was making his round. the following day, as we were working in the fields, he came to see us. He was launching an agricultural campaign that had been decided, he said, in the interest of the country. He had chosen what we were to cultivate without even consulting us. And now he wanted to tell us about a deputy. My father coldly greeted him. Not far from there, we went to Abomey. Despite the threat of an imminent storm, my father and I came to attend the party The storyteller was relating the exploits of our former kings. During our absence, lightning had hit our house. The sun rose on a depressing sight of desolation. Our house and our harvests had been destroyed. We had not been attentive enough to the voodoos. Thus, they had decided to test us. This is what I was thinking. And this was what my father was saying. With him, I went to consult the marabout. The marabout explained the origin of our misfortune. For too long had I neglected the fetishes. However, a number of signs must have warned me. And so I remembered I had hurt myself with my hoe. A few days ago. Also, for more than a week I had been passing near the fetishes without honouring them. Through the mouth of the marabout, I was remembered of the pact of alliance and interdependence that had been made between the voodoo and me. So as to keep it strong, the sacred power of the voodoo needs to receive the recommended sacrifices and offerings. My forgetfulness had sidelined me from my community. The marabout told me the conditions for me to reintegrate in the human group. I had to distance myself from the village and accomplish a number of offerings. I couldn't decide on leaving. I talked to old Abo. He advised me against leaving. He thought my place was in the village. I don't know how, he ended up telling me about the last days of slavery. "You, my son", he said, "Even if you were baptised," "don't forget we initiated you." "If you decide to leave despite it all," "you must never lose contact without the sacred things of your country." Old Abo had moved me. But he had not convinced me. Our harvest was lost. Our soil could not feed us anymore. I had to earn a living. My father had put all his hopes in me. I had to leave. And so my father dispensed his last recommendations. I had one last look at the village. And I left. Cotonou is far away! I thought it would take me several days. I randomly tried to hitch-hike. I couldn't believe it. The very first car stopped. I did the trip in one go! The first thing I saw in the city. Adjito players in a passionate duel. I asked them the way. They were way too busy to care. In the end, they showed the way. I arrived at my cousin's home. Ah! It's you. How are you doing? - Am I disturbing you? - No, no. You were sleeping... - What's up in the village? How are you parents ? - Fine. Do you have a job? - I just arrived. - Oh, right. So... - For your job, I will... - Who is that? It's Codjo, my cousin! We were born in the same village. For your job, I'll talk to my friend at the harbour. In the meantime... This is Brigitte. Codjo. I'll see what I can do. I was intimidated. These persons seemed weird. This cousin had too much self-confidence. These girls, Brigitte, who was living with him... Why is she staring at me? How are you doing? It's fine, thank you. Oh no... Well... Uh... Excuse me. Hi everybody! Here is what the car needs. It must be ready by Monday! We can trust this client, I swear! If we drive fast, we'll be in Lomey in 3 hours. They'll wait for us there. It's a piece of cake! Well... Is that all? Boss, don't you have something to eat? And there is also this weird guy that they call Johnny. I don't understand a thing he means. I find him very suspect. I was more and more embarrassed. So... It's a deal? Are you crazy? - Of course it's a deal! - Good. Some people like to spoil your days off! During my days off... I'll take care of that business. Anyway... You found your way to the house alone, thanks to the address? It was difficult at first but... - I met people who helped me. - You know, I have a lot of problems. I asked people from the neighbourhood to watch my back. But don't worry, I'll sort it out. I'll call a friend, he will solve the problem. Well... You will go home now. We need to have a men's talk. Very well. No more women. Well! So... Don't worry about your job. But you will have to listen to what people will tell you. If you listen, there will be no problem. If you come to Cotonou and don't listen to our advice, you're done for! Go home! - You understand? - I understand. I'm not trying to scare you, it's the reality. Cotonou is not our village. You understand? - I understand. - Good. If you understand, let me take care of you. Everything will be fine. Okay? The cousin had already planned everything. Organized everything. My father didn't need to worry. In my cousin's home, we would have been cramped. He took me with him. We went to visit my future landlord. Yes? - Hey, how are you doing? - I'm fine. Hello. - You're fine? - Hello Codjo. - Speak French. - How are you doing? So, you have to keep your windows closed? The rain! The rain! - All day long. - It's so troublesome! So, as I told you this morning, here is the young man. I entrust you with him. He's just arrived. He will need to... be guided. I liked her right away! Ask him to help you with the chores this evening. - Agreed! - Well... - So... - Goodbye. Codjo! See you again! - Sit down Codjo. - Thank you. How was your trip? One thing really reassured me. She was as intimidated as me. We exchanged a few banalities. I could only think about one thing: my future job! - How are your parents? - Very well. - I hope you will like living here. - I hope so. Can I... Can I ask you where the post station is? - The post station is nearby. - I have to write to my parents. Okay, I'll take you there. Come Codjo, I'll show you your room. The following day, I was working at the harbour. The job was not difficult. It was about transfering sacks. The first day passed without an incident. In the evening, the second day, somebody gave me a package for my cousin. I was told he already knew about it. That night, I wrote to my father. Dear Dad, No. My very dear Dad. What can I say? Dear Dad, Dear... Dear Dad... I was very well welcomed by our cousin. He lives with a woman called Brigitte. She was very nice with me. No, I'd better not mention this. Our cousin earns a good living. I haven't yet understood what exactly he is doing. I haven't yet understood what exactly he is doing. He got me a job at the harbour. I'm transferring sacks. It's not very difficult. I'll soon be able to send you some money. One month passed. My cousin had opened a bank account for me. I was able to make cash withdrawals. I have a savings account here. I brought my... bank book. What can I do for you? Why did I have to notice that girl? She was looking at me without prudishness nor impudence. And I... I couldn't take my eyes off of hers. I barely forgot my father and the money I had to send. That day, I didn't dare approach her. But the following days, I looked for her everywhere in the city. I found Assiba as she was coming from the hairdresser. We chatted a bit but I had to go to work. That day for the first time, I got bored. The following day was a day off. I had a rendez-vous with Assiba. Her name is Assiba. Assiba.. I like her name. We chatted. She is a student. It impressed me. I am but a mere farmer. Son of a mere farmer. I feel like I have many things to learn. I told her these thoughts. She kindly made fun of me. She told me she was the one who had many things to learn. Maybe? Anyway... She was intimidating. I didn't know what to do for her to like me. I could never be bored of being with her. Meanwhile my cousin was looking for me everywhere. When he finally found me, he gave me a notification of firing from the harbour. He was very upset. He told me he had great expectations for me and that he would not admit that I put shame on him. I answered I would always be worthy of him. But it was not what I really wanted to tell him. Thanks to my cousin, the following day I had a job at the airport. I was in charge of cleaning the planes during the stopovers. This is how I one day witnessed the arrival of the Holy Man. I learned later that the Holy Man was somebody important. He has connections in high places. He's a high-level gangster. My cousin was waiting for him at the airport and they had lunch together. How did it go, Boss? For the most part, everything went smoothly. Then, on my way back, I stopped at Abidjan. - For our deal. - Oh? He will come next week. - Really? There's no problem? - No, everything's fine.. - And Codjo? - Yes, Codjo! I had found him a job at the harbour. But the guy has a tendency to... Meddle in things that... But don't worry! Don't worry! He works are the airport now. - Here. - Yes, right here. He sweeps the planes. By the way, I have to meet his supervisor today. He is a bit late but he will be here soon. As it happens here he is. This is... He is our boss, he doesn't appreciate when people are late. And his lady. So, it's about Codjo. Can you guarantee it will work? - Everything will be fine - Even Codjo? - I'll take care of him. It will work. - It has to work. - Can I trust you? - Yes Boss! - Absolutely. - You know how I work. You have always been successful there is no doubt on that subject! When the Boss promise you something it's guaranteed it will happen. - Definitely. - That's our boss. Don't eat too much. I don't want you to get fat. Okay. Apart from that? When I met the Holy Man, he asked me to work for him. I told him I was satisfied with a little job. He laughed. - It will work! - I've launched the offensive! Actually, I couldn't care less about his offer. The only thing that mattered was that I had a rendez-vous with Assiba. Here is the house. - Are you sure you won't be in trouble? - No, idiot. Come in. I hadn't found yet the courage to talk to her. But she knew how much I cared for her. That evening, we arrived very late at her place. Assiba proposed me to sleep at her place. Hello Assiba. Hello Codjo. This night... I had a strange dream. You were with me. In my village. I was prisoner of a horrible smuggler. You bewitched him. Freeing me at the same time. Then... Something weird happened. Some kind of fight. I couldn't remember why I was there. I had a lapse of memory. Somebody was trying to destroy me. A fight to death. I think I won it. But...weakened. And shaking. Then I awoke. That's it. Dreams are often strange. Maybe not that much. I belong to the Convent of the Fetichists I believe in these dreams. The people of Dahomey are proud people. Besotted with justice. Rich of the plentiful resources of its country and its sharp mind. Capable of sacrificing all its savings, eager of taking charge and assuming its own destiny. I could think of nothing but Assiba. She had made me forget my father. I had forgotten my village. My job. All the reasons why I had come to the city. How could I realize that, in the meantime, my father was worrying? He wasn't receiving money anymore. He had no news from me. And I was not aware that he had had a heart attack. I was going out every night. The village was nowhere near my thoughts. Every night, I was having nightmares. I was neglecting the voodoos. Sooner or later, they were going to manifest their wrath. The dreams were telling me so. The dreams were saying the truth. I received a letter from the village. My father was very sick. I immediately understood he was about to die. The voodoos were telling me so. My father was very sick. He was about to die. - Hello. - Is Codjo here? Codjo? No. Why? - I need to see him. - Really. You can wait for him here. Thanks. How long have you known Codjo? It's none of your business. What? Hey! What a way to answer! If I'm bothering you... You know the way. What way? - You can wait for Codjo outside. - What? You can wait for Codjo outside! - Over there. - Over there? - Over there. Wait for him outside. - Who do you think you are? - I'm fed up! - What's wrong? It's is too much! We're fed up with your tricks! - At least, Codjo is honest. But you... - Wait for him over there. Get out! Leave! Hey Codjo! What's going on? I looked for you everywhere. Where were you? Where were you? - What's going on? - Go. I'm fed up! Fed up! You should go home now. Codjo! - Yes, what? - Let's go home. - I'm fed up! - Let's go! Wait! I... I'm fed up! Let's go! Codjo, what's the matter? What happened yesterday? I never saw you behave that way. I never saw you drink or smoke. What's the problem? Yesterday... things went mad in my head. It was too much, I couldn't take it. I thought... One or two glasses of whiskey... And a few cigarettes... may help me forget a few things. Some problems. She took me to the beach. For the first time, I was able to really talk to her. I told her I loved her. And that my father was about to die. I told her about my anxiety. First, the voodoos have set my house on fire. Now, they were taking my father. I told her about old Abo. Old Abo was right. One must never lose touch with the sacred things of one's land. I was in great disarray. I didn't know what to do anymore. Assiba asked me what I really wanted. I want to go back to my village, be near my father and heal him. That was my answer. "Then you have to go", she said. I told her I loved her and that I wanted to marry her. I arrived too late. Another heart attack had taken my father. He had already been buried. I sent a message to Assiba. She arrived the following day. Old Abo told me about the last days of my father. He showed me everything he did before his death. He told me what he was expecting from me. First and foremost, he wanted me to give him a grandson. I'm back home, at last. Here, I'm safe. I feel safe. And I'm not alone anymore. Assiba started to dance. And she bought the offerings. The voodoos are now protecting us. They received our offerings and they came back. They need us to remain strong. And we need them too. Subtitles: tadanobu@KG Timings: Chaiwalla Proofreading: flipflink
