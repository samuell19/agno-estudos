When you start to paint a picture, everything is possible. You can create your own world, there is no up or down, there is no right or wrong. All the ideas come out of your own mind, so, these ideas are you. Even the dark side that crawls out of your soul like an ulcer sometimes. And still you will never be able to paint as darkly as reality can. No black can even start to express how you feel, when the woman that you loved cheats on you and takes away your child. Just like that. Because she has more power. Because she is better at lying. And suddenly they’re telling you, that in the real world there is also no right or wrong... If you sign this legal settlement, we agree to 10,000 Euro compensation for damages, 7 months’ probation, and your wife guarantees you visitation rights once a week. Yes, and they throw me into the insane asylum. No. You must undergo therapy. But as an out-patient. You’ll go there once or twice a week. That’s it. Mr. Jelik, it’s pointless now. Let’s go. If I sign this, no one will ever believe that it wasn’t me. But who believes you anyway? Except for me? The truth will send you to jail, and you’ll lose your son. What use will the truth be then? So, you mean you don’t remember committing the offence? I mean, I did not commit the offence. These two just want my money. If it wasn’t you, who was it then? What you did to your wife, Mr. Jelik? I can tell you exactly! Fractures, bruises... And why? Because you could not bear that she dropped you for another guy! No, I didn’t even know that she was cheating on me! You were seen by a neighbour! How do you explain that? They want to take Simon away from me. That’s what it’s all about! I tried to call you more than once last night... Where have you been? You know what time it is, right? You’ve had company? Why? Because of the beer. But these bottles are still full. So, what did you do? David, it wasn’t me. I know. Of course not. Hey, calm down, ok? Maybe you just need a little distraction? No, stop it, David. Hey, Freddy, come on... I’m going to the bathroom. Excuse me! -What kind of a dickhead are you? Sorry, I couldn’t have known someone was in there. I couldn’t have known, I couldn’t have known... You slammed the door in my face, man! Yes, I’m sorry. You’re sorry... maybe you should turn on your brain... Even you can figure out that someone might take a piss in the toilet! You’re the guy I saw in the newspaper, right? The one who was cheated on by his wife and then beat the shit out of her, right? My brother Freddy was quite famous for his work a while ago. You should see his paintings! Ah, there he is. Freddy, this is Nadja and Nicole. I already invited the two ladies to your exhibition. You won’t believe it, they don’t know your paintings. Never mind. David exaggerates. His surgery is far more exciting. Surgery? Are you a doctor? Assistant doctor. But my apartment is way more interesting than my office. I need to ask you to leave the bar immediately. Excuse me? -Don’t make a fuss, ok? Get out. Hey, what’s this about? We didn’t do anything! Your friend beat up another guest in the toilets. Idid what...? -Get your stuff and get out. You must be joking! Chuck this asshole out! - Hey, calm down! What did you do? Urn, nothing. They tasted weird. Hey, it’s been tough lately, right? Yes, quite... Radio: Freddy Jelik’s case shows once again that offenses of domestic violence are rarely punished with appropriate penalties. The victim Sandra Jelik told us after the hearing that the famous painter, who had initially maintained his innocence despite the overwhelming evidence, was able to get away with quite a lenient legal settlement. Urn... We are the new neighbours. We just wanted to introduce ourselves. That’s Mizi, my daughter and I’m Paula, we’re from Berlin. And we don’t come empty-handed. Here you go. For me? Thank you. But isn’t the custom the other way around? The new neighbours get bread and salt from the old ones? I told you, but you didn’t want to listen to me... Ok, but aren’t all these customs a matter of interpretation? Although now I realize why I’ve never seen anybody running around with so much bread and salt... Urn... would you like to corne in? Have a drink? I think we have to get going with our welcorne-crusade. But thank you. Ok, see you around. See you! Bye! Hey, it’s me. When can I see Simon? Preferably not at all? You know full well that the legal settlement allows me to see him at least once a week... I know. Saturday. Saturday evening. -What? Hey... Did you start your therapy yet? - Yes. I’ll be in Salzburg in an Ayurvedic Spa over the weekend. If you wanna see Simon, that’s your chance. Ayurveda Spa? Sounds like things are going well for you, huh? He could at least stay here for one night, no? It’s not a problem... No. He can’t. Krishna takes him to Yoga class. Yoga class? He’s eight! What’s an eight-year-old doing in a yoga class? I’ll drop him off in the morning then, ok? That’s your cat? Yes, Monty. Urn, yeah, I’d like to ask if maybe you and your mother want to come over for dinner later. Only if you don’t... Wait a minute. only if you don’t have other plans. Yes, we’re happy to come over! Ok? Around seven? No, that one doesn’t work either. Oh dear, everything is going downhill for this guy. -Why? You don’t know him? It’s Mr. Jelik. He used to be really famous, but then he beat up his wife... He is always friendly around here though. This one was closed two months ago. The remaining amount of 174,862 Euro has been withdrawn. Closed? How is it possible my wife can close my account without my knowledge? But it wasn’t your wife. You withdrew the money and closed the account yourself. What? Me? I closed the account? Are you completely out of your mind? I’d remember that, wouldn’t I? But look here. That’s your signature, correct? You’re in on this too? How much did she pay you? A share of my money? Mr. Jelik, I’ve got nothing to do with this. Maybe you just forgot about it? Now let me go, ok? You’re hurting me! Ah, the one in Rosen street? Yes, the optician. But why didn’t you go on working as a nurse? Well, there’s no hospital here anyways... That’s true! Being a nurse is a really hard job anyways. All those night shifts and then I have to care for... MUM! You gotta see this, it’s really great! So? Isn’t it awesome? Wow. Beautiful! Who is this? That’s my wife. Your wife? Yes, I mean, we’ve been separated for a while. We also have a little boy... Simon. But he’s with her most of the time. Why? That’s a long story. I’ll tell you another time, ok? But hey, did you see these paintings? They’re paintings of your school! Really? -Yes, really. Great. Do you want to go outside? - Yes! Did you buy the house? That’d be nice. No, it’s my aunt’s. But we can stay until we find something else. Damn. I thought you were rich. She’s sweet! What’s the matter? Are you starting the “I’m going crazy, you’re only in my head” thing again? You’re not really here. You’re not really here. I’m not really here. I’m not really here! Well, that’s a complex discussion. Because we consist of billions of particles, Freddy. And they’re always moving. This implies that you never really are where you are. I read in my records, that you had hallucinations as a child an imaginary friend called Eddy, right? Why did Eddy disappear? Look, I know exactly what you’re thinking, ok? You think I lost it, went crazy and did this to Sandra. But why? I didn’t even know that she was having an affair. So maybe it was Eddy. Maybe he beat her up? There is no Eddy. Risen from the dead? Yeah, sorry. You know what was going on. Hey, where are my paintings? They are neatly packed in storage. You can pick them up anytime. Tonio? This is Freddy. Freddy Jelik. Ah, piacere. Bad news... I don’t like your art, Freddy Jelik. Pretentious, too colourful... Too colourful? Pick them up? What are you talking about? What about the exhibition? The paintings from the Munich gallery will be delivered to your home, of course. What about the exhibition, Carlotta? Tonio? I’ll take care of the projection. Hey, all this shit in court... It wasn’t me, ok? Aggravated assault, Freddy. Don’t you read the newspaper? You even admitted it yourself! Yes, I know. But it’s not true. Okay like this, or is it too bright? Sandra wanted to take Simon away from me. What was I supposed to do? You should have considered this before you decided for her. 5,000. 5,000, what? I’ll keep your paintings and sell them as a set. You know exactly that the skull itself is worthl2,000 Euros minimum... Was. Was worthl2,000 Euro. Unfortunately, you only have yourself to blame. Are you nuts? I need the money! Hey, painter, piss off! You are full of shit, painter! All painters are full of shit. colourful and shitty. Antonio? Would you make a green tea for us? Toni and I are a couple now. So what? Just to let you know. Money, money, money... It was always only about money... She only wanted my money!! But it’s all worthless now... She just wanted more. More and more. And then she just took what she wanted. With no regard. She dug her own grave now. She just doesn’t know it yet. But she has... and a guy like that always needs more. I don’t even have enough money for this guy, Christian. maybe Sandra still got some cash hidden between her plastic tits! I hope you’re aware that if anybody passes by right now, he’ll think I just broke up with you... Didn’t you? No. I’m here to help you. You know that. Hey, you stay here, ok? You don’t want us to show up there like the double Lottie, do you? I take care of it. Wait a second! Shit. You look exactly like me. What are you doing here? I had a think about our last conversation. I think you’re right. Right about what? What kind of paintings will be exhibited here tomorrow? Certainly not yours. You know, I made a wrong decision a while ago. Leave. Sure? Sure. Completely sure. And why? Nobody wants your paintings anymore. People hate you and therefore, your paintings too. Got it? And you? Do you hate me as well? You know what they said in court? They said I slammed Sandra’s face against the wall. Over and over again. She said she had never seen me like this before. So? Your paintings will hang back on the walls tomorrow. You even get an advance. But... you should reconsider your acquaintances... Good morning! Awake already? I always thought artists sleep until noon? Well... I have to prepare an exhibition. Exciting! It’s not that exciting... Mizi was quite impressed by your paintings. Really? Yes, she even said that you’re the only one among these peasants that she can deal with. That might be the best compliment I’ve had in years! Hey, Ihavea lot of salt left... We will see... Your mail? Freddy, where are you? It’s your turn! 8.10 metres? You’re a cheater! Cheater? Me? I can still do it! Now I know where you’ve been the whole time! In the attic, training long-jump! Hey, this is David, but this time you stay here, ok? So? What did you want to show me? Hey, you took the old C64 out? Awesome! What’s that? Sunshine Games? No, that’s not it... Huh? Of course, it’s Sunshine Games. Oh god, you’ll think I’m completely insane... What? What are you talking about? Hey, promise this will stay between us! Yes, sure. Eddy is back. What? Yes, sure! No, really. Two minutes ago, he was sitting in your place. Honestly. Here? Did I crush him? Do you think I’m crazy? Are you serious? You’re shitting me, right? Come with me! You’re playing guitar again? Not me! That’s Eddy’s room! Hey, what did you say to her? Good morning, what else? And who did you say you are? I didn’t. She didn’t ask me. Hey, are you jealous? Hey, are you wearing my sweater? Yeah, gotta do my laundry first. Problem? No, no... Hey, let’s take a picture together, ok? Hey David... Yes. No, I just wanted to take a picture of... Mizi, please... Great. Mizi, that was excellent! I’d say we’ve got a new talent here! What do you think? Don’t mind, it was really nice. I hope you make something out of it. Yes, I want to be a singer. Oh, “I want to be a singer”...! Wolfi! Don’t let them get you. It was very beautiful. Now let’s go on... Dirty bastard! Excuse me? So, you got out of that easily, by simply declaring yourself insane? Mrs. Birkle, you know well enough, that it wasn’t me who came out of the house, ok? Then you flat-out lie to me, just like that. But I can imagine where this comes from. It is well known that all artists take drugs... I know exactly who I saw there. Maybe you shouldn’t believe everything written in your tabloids. Look at the forecast. Today it says rain. And? Not even a cloud! Get up. Why? Get up on the table. On the table? Yes, I guess you are capable of the German language. Come on, get up on the table! And now? Good. Very good Now close your eyes. Concentrate. Are you joking? Do I look like I’m joking? Let your arms hang. Calm down. Now listen deep inside yourself. Close your eyes. Think about something nice... Have you ever been to Africa? No. -Me neither. Never mind. Think of a lion. A great big lion. He’s lying in the steppes under a tree. He’s lying there, big and powerful, in the sun. Snoozing. Suddenly he hears a noise! Carefully he opens his eyes... eyes open... and he’s looking around and now he starts roaring! Start roaring, Freddy! Like a lion! -You want me to do what? Roar! Like a lion! Come on! Now come on! Roar! Roar! Is it so hard? That’s all? Roar, Freddy! Otherwise the court will have to declare the treatment a failure. Come on. More! Is that all you got? Otherwise you’ll never see your son again, Freddy... Freddy, you’re a hopeless case. Excuse me? I mean look at you! Standing on a table! Doing animal voices... What’s wrong with you? I thought you were a grown man? What... It was you who told me... Yes, because I wanted you to finally open your mouth! So, you start talking to me! Did Eddy beat up your wife? Was it him? Or did he tell you to do it? Where is Eddy now? Is he at your home? Is he sleeping in your bed? Or is he just deep inside you? He’s not inside me, ok. Freddy, I want to help you. But for this to happen you need to start cooperating. He just reappeared. But it’s not like before. It’s completely different. Everything ok? Something happened? I was about to go eat an ice cream. You wanna join? Now? During the winter? Who says you can only eat ice cream in the summer? Is there a law? Look, I have 5 Euro. That’s enough for both of us. C’mon! The ice cream was a really good idea! Right? I told you! And what shall we do now? -Wait for the bus. You don’t want to walk, do you? -No... Would you draw a picture of me? Sure. Ok, now it’s my turn. Your turn? -To draw you! That’s me? And this? What is this? A guitar. A guitar? It was wonderful when you played it. I played the guitar? Two days ago? In front of our house? The song that was dedicated only to me... Come here. You’re freezing cold... I know you don’t want to hear this, but... He’s back. You’re the only one I can tell this. Everybody thinks I’m insane, Mum. Even David. Nobody believes me... Why did you kill him? He was your brother!! But I promised Mum I wouldn’t tell you. Mum? Mum hasn’t been responsive for years. And you? You watch me talking about an imaginary friend the whole time and make a fool of myself! Not telling me anything! I had a twin brother! But he died shortly after birth! You know what Momma said? Mum said, I killed him! Don’t take this too seriously. Mum suffers from dementia. I shouldn’t take this so seriously? If I shouldn’t take this so seriously, why didn’t anybody tell me about it? You had just begun to do a little better when I heard about it. Damn. Mum said you were strong and powerful when you were born and he was a weakling from the very beginning. And that you had sucked him dry inside her belly. She thought that was the reason you invented Eddy. I sucked him dry? Apparently. You seem to have developed some feelings of guilt. Subconsciously. But you can’t live both lives. Eddy is dead... Dirty bastard! I know exactly who I saw there. How are you? Fine? You? Good, thanks! Urn... rny son Sirnon is Corning over tornorrow and we’re gonna go to the swimming pool. I’d wanted to ask... If you’re free... well, you and Mizi could join us... I gotta work. -You gotta work... But I’m sure Mizi is in! Simon is only eight, but it should be ok, right? No Problem. Hey, where is he going? Is he heading to Mrs. Birkie? Seems like it. Oh god, I hope everything is alright. Yeah. hopefully. Hello. Two children, one adult, please. Seventeen Euro. Seventeen Euro? With warm bathing surcharge! With warm bathing surcharge... Exactly. Exhale when you’re underwater. Right. And keep the legs together. Wait a minute. -What’s going on? Stay here for a moment, ok? What are you doing here? What do you think I’m doing? I’m a lifeguard, I’m doing my job here! Sorry, I got you confused. Calm down a little, ok? Yeah, I’m really sorry. Hey, how did it go? Al right. They got along really well. If Mizi needs a cheeky brother again, she can always join. I was always dreaming about having a brother. A big one who protects me. Yes, you’ve got one, right? Yes, I have a half-brother, David. And you know what’s really crazy? I just found out that I had a twin brother who died shortly after birth. That’s hard. Well, yeah, whatever... Daddy, when are you coming? On my way! -I wanna leave! Airight, ok! The boss is calling... Hey, you asked about going sledging, right? We could go on Friday. Shall we come over and pick you up? Great! -2 pm? How are you? -Fine. We were at the swimming pool. How is she? Same as always. Granny, my name is Simon. My dear Eddy. Mum, that’s Simon. Your grandson. Grandma, stop it. Why is she talking about Eddy? Mum, Eddy is dead. Maybe it’s not me hallucinating, what if Eddy is still alive? Freddy, that’s bullshit. Eddy died at birth. Look. Simon nearly looks the same as me as a child, that means Eddy must have looked like this too. Simon, stop it! Freddy, you were talking about Eddy for years! Mum is completely demented. She mixes everything up. So what? She recognized him! She didn’t recognize shit! Shit is a swear word! Mum, is Eddy still alive? Simon, you got everything? -Yes, I got the Ultrapowerman magazine. Ultrapowerman magazine? You bought this, I assume? Yes, I bought it for my son. And I don’t give a shit if it disrupts your chakras. It’s not about me, Freddy. It’s about your son. You’re blocking his mental development. I’m doing what? Listen, Christian, I don’t need your shit around here, ok? Pretending to be a hermit but showing up with a posh car like this? How does that work? -Krishna, let’s go. I wish you would loosen up for once. You’re emanating such a grey aura, I can barely stand it. What are you talking about? Grey aura? What’s worse? The fact that she left you, or that I’m fucking her now? That also wasn’t you, right? Sandra, he was... Fuck off, you asshole!! And never, ever touch me again! Sandra, let’s go. He’s insane. He doesn’t know what he’s doing. Sandra, he provoked me and... I will report everything in court. You’ll never see Simon again! Hey, you can’t do that! You didn’t hear what he was saying, he... Sandra, let’s leave! This guy is mental, he has no idea what he’s doing. How did you get in here? The patio door was open. What’s that supposed to be? Is this a biotope or are you into Japanese art now? No. I saw this in a film... Oh right, Paranormal Activity! Because of the footsteps! Are you serious? Because of me? Put yours next to it. Ah, no, this won’t work, I’ve still got your shoes on. Shall I try barefoot? No, drop it... Hey, what happened to my guitar by the way? It fell on the floor. It fell on the floor. What a pity... Hey, you are my brother, right? Sure. Brother! No, you stay inside. I’ll take care of it! What’s the matter? Who would do something like this? Someone killed it? That’s our cat... Yes, I know, I know... As a child Eddy supported you in your self-confidence and now he’s doing it again. I know you don’t believe me, but I’m not insane. He has to be my twin brother. His name was also Eddy, right? Yes! But David just told me about him. That means that as a child I couldn’t have known that he was called Eddy as well. Mr. Jelik, not long ago, you assured me that Eddy does not exist at all. Now he not only exists, but he’s also your dead twin brother. What kind of story will I hear tomorrow? I think my mother lied to David. He never died. But why is he showing up now? Now that you’re feeling miserable. Where has he been all this time? And in particular, why can only you see him? Lunch break already? No, I have a meeting with the principal because of the cat. It was someone from school? Maybe. There’s a boy that’s bullying her the whole time. She just told me now. Ok. You want me to come along? I think I can do it by myself! Hey, I’d like to take you out some time, if... Absolutely! See you! We should watch this... David! Sorry, I have to talk to you! Are you nuts? You can’t just barge in here! It’s important! I have the proof! Eddy is alive! Go and wait outside, damn it. So, I’ll see you in two weeks, ok? Okay, thanks. - Goodbye. You have to see this! Are you crazy? You can’t just burst in here! Ok, that was stupid. But never mind. Now look at this! Isn’t this crazy? He’s real! Watch this! Eeny, meeny, miney, moe, catch a tiger by the toe, if he hollers let him go! Isn’t this bizarre? He’s alive! Ok, Freddy, listen. The last few weeks have been stressful, but you need help. What? Are you crazy? Look here, you can see him for yourself! I see only you. And I can smell the alcohol. You filmed yourself and just can’t remember it. What bullshit! Look carefully! The guy in the video isn’t me! It’s not... Eddy is alive! Yes... Hey, you really think I’m a lunatic, right? No, no, I’m sorry. I talked to your therapist and no, I do understand it. You’ve had a hard time and now this old story comes up again... You did what? First you tell me about having a brother and then you talk to this psycho doc behind my back? I told you Mum made me promise not to tell you! You know what? I don’t give a fuck what you say. I’m going to find my real father. He has to know if my twin brother is still alive or not. Great idea. Go find your father. Mum didn’t run from him without a reason. Perfect timing to go clear things up with your violent father. Go to the damn therapy, Freddy! Fuck you, David Where are you? Are you in the attic? What are you doing there? Nothing. I was looking for my old guitar, because yours is broken. So? Didn’t find anything. Never mind. Hey, I had a little look through your closet. Looks good on me, right? Well, you look just like me. So, we both have great taste in fashion! Why so dressed up? Got a job? Job? No... You never know what the day will bring. Hey, I brought you flowers. Thank you. From what you have told me, you most likely suffer from schizophrenia. To start off with, I’ll prescribe medication. You’ll get your prescription at the front desk... Furthermore, I’d like to ask you to participate in our study. What kind of study? For a long time, it was assumed that, besides experiential psychological factors, genetics play a major role in schizophrenia as well. Scientists have found a gene mutation which is clearly related to a special form of schizophrenia. This gene mutation attenuates the prefrontal cortex, which is the region of the brain that controls moods and behaviours. In some cases, these genetical changes, release creative potential, in others it leads to psychotic delusions. And this genetic test can determine whether I’m schizophrenic? It is just a study... But that means you can also determine that I am not, right? It’s just a study. Hundreds of DNA samples get compared. It’s an indication, but it won’t offer 100% certainty. Yes... no, we had a fight and he is not talking to me anymore. That’s why I ask you. Genetic Test? Ok, if it’s genetic it could affect me as well, right? Yes, ok, I’ll pass by the laboratory. Thank you very much Dr Weiss. What are you doing here? Urn... the door was open. I rang the bell three tirnes, and because nobody answered, I went in. Is that ok? Yes, I guess I didn’t hear the bell because I was listening to music. No school today? No. Actually yes, but... I decided not to go. But don’t tell Mum, ok? Do you like it? Yes, but the guitar was broken, wasn’t it? I bought a new one. I thought it would be a shame to stop, now that I found such a talented singer. May I sit on your bed? It’s easier for to practice together that way. I play the guitar and we both hum along, ok? Seems like we need to practice quite a bit! Let’s try the following. You close your eyes and then we hum together, ok? Keep going. Feel the vibrations in your whole body. In your face... In your throat... In your chest... In your belly... Feel it all the way down. I gotta go. But we continue another time, ok? What makes you think I want anything from you? I’m here to protect you. I thought you knew. People got hurt. I never wanted this. Oh really? What did you think I would do when we went to Carlottas gallery for example? Only talk to her? You did that already, Freddy. I just do what you don’t dare to. That’s all. But I don’t want this. You are not me, ok? I don’t want you here anymore. Leave me alone! Don’t you find that a bit rude? After everything I’ve done for you! I actually think it’s the other way round and you owe me. And what would that be? My house? My money? What? No, it’s not about any of that, is it? It’s about Paula, right? I saw you when you were “accidentally bumping into her”. Oh, you were spying on me? I wouldn’t have expected that of you. Don’t make me laugh! What else then? What? What do you want from me? Something you and mother took away from me a long time ago. Hey? Shall we go? Go where? Urn... Sledging? Sorry, I completely forgot. And Mizi? Isn’t she coming along? No, she is busy. But if you don’t feel like going, we don’t have to. No, no. I just had... I’m sorry, I’m a little confused today. Give me five minutes to change, ok? 5 Minutes! I meet you at the garage! You don’t believe me? Wait and see! Faster! One more ride? One, two, three! You know what? I’m happy Mizi isn’t here now. Me too. Psst. And Simon. And my mother... We’re behind the first mountain slope on the right side. Wait, now. Look. Can you see it? Look who it is! Is this the new neighbour? Yes, Paula, this is my brother. David. Pleasure! And this is... Don’t you remember her? We met her in the bar! Yes, of course. Sorry. They have mulled wine here? Yes, over there! You want one? -Yes, I’d love one! Then you have to watch my sledge. And also, my brother. He’s going through a difficult phase... Where did Paula go? Isn’t she with you? She followed you. What did you say to her, David? What? Nothing. You waved her to come over. I waved to her? Me? Yes. Over there. You are such a beautiful woman, Paula. Paula, is everything ok? Everything ok? Are you out of your mind? Are you hurt? You kicked me! What kind of an asshole are you? It wasn’t me! I swear! I nearly hit that tree! Eddy did this! My twin brother, ok? When I came back with mulled wine, you were gone. And then I saw you and Eddy on the sledge... Eddy? Who is Eddy? He’s my twin brother. He looks exactly like me. Really? A few days ago, you told me, your fucking twin brother was dead! That’s what I thought! But he’s back, he’s alive and wants to ruin my life! Yes, sure! And why did I nearly get killed then? And not you? I don’t know! I have no idea why he is doing all of this. But he pretends to be me! You have to believe me! That was Eddy. I am Freddy, I told you... Listen, I don’t fucking care who you are right now. I just want all of your personalities to disappear in front of my house, ok? Is that you? Didn’t you want to sleep at Anja’s house? Mr. Jelik? Do you think I’m an idiot? These are extremely serious allegations against you! Are you aware of that? I did not abuse Mizi. She is fourteen. She is a child. Stop it! It’s all in her diary! And sexual acts against minors are criminal offences. You know that, don’t you? And when was this supposed to have happened then? Several times, Mr. Jelik! The girl already confessed! Listen, I did not touch the girl, ok? I swear! So? Nothing. He denies everything. He doesn’t stop talking about his twin brother, who he’s sure is alive. I’m sorry, we can’t do anything. These here are the genetic similarities between you and your brother Freddy. Because you’re half brothers there is only a 25% match. Ok, and why are you showing me this? Now look at this profile. It’s a 100% match. What? Who is this? This person got in the database for another study. And there is no doubt now that he is the twin brother of Freddy Jelik. I can’t believe it... I don’t recall my lawyer’s number, but just call Dr Weiss, ok? I went to therapy that day, I was not with Mizi! Ah, psychotherapy? Just call Dr Weiss please, okay? Airight. So what’s the doctor’s number then? Freddy, you won’t believe it. You were right! Eddy is alive, he is real! They found his profile doing the genetics test. He has exactly the same DNA as you! I have his address. He lives in Miesbach, 46 Karlinger street. Listen, I have to do one more home visit then we can meet there, ok? That’s unbelievable. I’ll meet you there. Ok, see you there. Bye. TV: Mr. Jelik, incredible exhibition opening yesterday. Congratulations. -Thank you very much. TV: I’ve heard more than half of the paintings are already reserved? David, come in! He’s not here! Did you break the door? Yes, no one opened, so what else could I do? But look at this. These are all articles about me. My previews, the court hearings... and here, Sandra’s charity ball! These are all articles about me! The guy haunted me at every turn, David! This is sick. He was in a mental institution for years. I called them. They told me he has a severe psychosis. That’s completely absurd, man. Here’s a picture of me, when I started as assistant doctor. That’s two years ago! This guy is completely mental. Prescriptions, medication, admissions in several psychiatric hospitals... Look, even a court summons for physical assault. And I thought you were the crazy one! The doctors from the mental hospital told me the whole story. You were right all along! Really? What did they tell you? Sounds like Mum fled in the middle of the night and abandoned Eddy. That’s bad enough already. Then they put him in an orphanage and... And? Go on... And he escaped and killed your father. That was the ticket to the closed psychiatric hospital. And he always knew that there was a twin brother out there, who had a better life... You think so? Yes, sure! He must have read some articles about you. But that’s not very surprising, considering Sandra’s urge to share every little detail about you. Yeah, she really did. So now we know where this guy has been the whole time. In a closed psychiatric hospital And he’s definitely not going back there... Mrs. Naegele? I’ll be back in a minute, ok? It looks like everything Mr. Jelik told us is true. There really is a twin brother, Eddy. You want to tell me that it was Eddy who slept with Mizi? It’s the only logical explanation. But that can’t be true. He told me his twin brother is dead. How shall I explain this to Mizi? Hi, I can’t take your call right now. Please leave a message. David, it’s me. I’m back home now. Dr. Weiss’ receptionist confirmed that I was in therapy that day. Call me back please! What did you do? Me? I went shopping. Look, the fridge is completely full. What did you do to Mizi? Oh, the little bitch? That’s what this is all about? What would you have liked to do to her, Freddy? That’s the question here. Because everything I do is happening only in your head! I’m the one you would really like to be! But you don’t dare to! And why? Because you’re a conservative asshole. That’s the reason your wife is fucking someone else. Because you’re such a loser. Your life has become so boring that you started fantasizing. You’re a sad man, Freddy. Ami? We’ll ensure that you and your daughter get psychological support. Mr. Winninger, I have to talk to you. What’s the matter? -The child is missing. We can’t find her. Have you had enough, Freddy? What did they do to you? Oh my god. I’m so sorry! I didn’t want this to happen! My mother read my diary and... Why is he doing this? Why? What’s my daughter got to do with this? Hey, your face is all smeared up. Let’s go to the bathroom. Why have you got so much make up on? What are you trying to do? You want me to tell you what you look like? You look like a little whore! A little slut! What do you see now? Huh? What do you see now? Are you a little wet? What do you see now? What do you see now? A little child! A small child! You didn’t really think I was interested in a small child, right? Oh, now you’re crying? Why? Huh? Why? Because I’m not interested in you? Is that it? Because I think your mother is hotter than you? Shall I show you again how it feels like to be a real woman? Run! Mizi! Run! Where’s the little pussy? Look, we can wait here. When’s school over? She’ll be here any moment. Freddy, I really thought it was you who... If I were you, I would have thought the same. You know where he is now, right? Excuse me? Is that a guitar? -Yes. Can I have it for a moment? Yes, but isn’t this a cast on your arm? How do you wanna play it then? Well, I’ve got one good arm left, don’t I! Thank you! I didn’t know! That I play the guitar? Sure. Open the door! Open the door, it’s the police! Help! Help!
