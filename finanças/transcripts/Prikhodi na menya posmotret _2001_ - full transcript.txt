Come Take a Look at Me Based on the play by N. Ptushkina "While She Was Dying" [ "The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby" (C. Dickens) ] "Tim Linkinwater was joyful himself... ...and little Miss La Creevy was in such a comical state, that of themselves they would have composed the pleasantest party conceivable. Then, there was Mrs Nickleby, so grand and complacent..." Will life become easier for you when I die? What's wrong, mom? Do I continue? A lot of us, old people, hope that our departure will ease the struggle of the ones we love. I will die, but I'm afraid your life would become even worse after that. Mom, do you have pains? Right..."There was... ...hat the old servant stood transfixed behind his master's chair, and felt his eyes grow..." Again! I had enough of their repairs! It's time! I'm not afraid of death. I'm afraid for you, Tanya. I'm leaving you without a husband, children, anyone close to you. You're the best daughter one could ever have! Why is it so unfair? Why do you have to end your path alone? Mom, there's lots of old maids in the world. Don't you dare say that! You're pretty, slim, educated, intelligent, honest, good around the house, no bad habits. A model old maid. I'm serious. I'm serious as well. Page 162. I've never asked you... What about an omelette? Slowly roasted, with cheese, celery? Can I ask this at least before I die? Were you ever in love? Mom, I fall in love so easily. I was, about 30 years ago. What about an apple and carrot salad? Huh, mom? Did you have any hookups? Hookups? What do you mean? Well, let's assume... Don't get offended... Let's assume, with men? Well, with men only, I'm afraid. Mom, don't worry. All of this is in the past. You have a past? Many?.. Many what? Well, of these...hookups? Two, I think. Two? In the span of how long? Mom, don't worry. In all my life. Only two! Horrible! How long ago? Pretty long ago. Why didn't you want to marry those two? They didn't want to, mom. Idiots! Well, where are they now? Both are married, as far as I know. Do you still talk to them? Not since they got married. That's not practical, Tanya. They could've become widowers! Or divorced... I'm sure they remember you very well. And regret their mistakes horribly. Don't think so. That's it, mom, dinner time! The salad. What about your colleague from the editorial? Oh, God forbid, forget about him. You will be left alone because of my egoism. It's hard to die with such a burden! Mom, what's up with you today? Don't get scared! Don't cry, don't panic! I know I'll die! Today! Or tomorrow! I'm calling for a doctor immediately. A doctor won't console me. Only one thing will give me peace before I leave you. You having a husband! Knocks. The neighbour? Strange that they're knocking and not ringing. The power is out, mom. Ask who is it. Who? Tanya, cookoo! Cookoo! Hello. Mom, please call Tatiana here. I'm Tatiana. Tanya, who is this? One moment, mom! Wait, are you the only Tatiana here? Yes, the only one. I'm sorry. Hold it please. Let's check. Where was it... Stolyarov Street 13, house 3, flat 27, right? 3B. What 3B? 3B, the house. Wait, there's "A"? Of course, there's "C", "D" and "F". She didn't mention the letter... Oh dear... Thank you for the consultation. I have to walk through the entire alphabet now. Oh, sorry! Sorry. Time to start the foot-climb... It's pretty dark here at your place. Take the candle! I have a lighter... a broken one... Have the candle. What am I going to look like with that candle? The holy pathfinder... Careful. There's something slippery there sometimes. All right then. Be careful. Goodbye! What happened? You need help, mom? I slipped. The neighbour child always chews on his bananas and throws all the peels to us. Did you break anything? At your age it's pretty... I don't need your help. Go. Is it sore? Let me at least walk you there. It's alright now, thank you. Why are you crying? Don't mind me... My mom is dying right now... Well... I'm powerless here... My condolences. Hold this. As they say, money won't help... Will all the sincerity! Are you crazy? Well, all of us had mothers once. Don't worry, it's not a large sum for me. How dare you humiliate me like this? Tanya! Tanya, where are you? I'm coming, mom! Will you manage? I will, don't worry. Well, bye then. Wait! No, no, no, sorry, you can go. Wait! Listen, what do you want from me? Help me walk, please. Grab the arm. No, pass me the flowers and champagne. You hold the candle. Hello. Mom, please meet, uh... Igor. My pleasure! And this is... Tanya, did you forget all the names today? That's Sofya Ivanovna, my mother. My pleasure. So that's you... Yes, I told you about her. Do you know each other for long? Yes, for about 20-30... Years. Exactly 30 years! Time flies fast! Right, Igor? Incredible! Fast indeed... My pleasure! Have a seat, Igor. Please. Can I call you just Igor? Yes, of course. God... Tanya, why didn't you say we were expecting guests? Well, you need to make something. Something tasty, you know... to go with champagne. Pass me the roses, please. Oh my God, oh my God! I feel young and happy! Tanya, it's been so long since we had roses in the house... Are you stuck? Hang Igor's jacket up and go to the kitchen. We'll talk in the meanwhile. Please. Oh no... you know, it's time for me... No, no, no! I'm not letting you go! Open the champagne! Please take off your jacket for starters. Tanya, I don't understand, why are you still standing? Don't worry, I'll be back soon. Tanya told me so much about you... About me? She's got no one to talk about but you. You're mistaking me with someone. No! My legs are rubbish, that's true. But my head, you see for yourself. Thank God! Is perfectly fine. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you. Interesting, so what did she say? You won't believe... Only the good things. You cannot even imagine how much she likes you! Indeed, I had no idea. I already see that you're somewhat unsure about yourself. Don't be. You've made some mistakes, things happen. It's all in the past now. Everything can be fixed. Don't get upset about your age. For you, happiness is still very possible. What happiness? Family happiness, of course. No other exists. I prefer personal happiness. The thing you're looking for... is at the end of the hall. Where can I buy flowers and champagne in your rathole? I'll give the money back to you. I don't want money! Just wait for quarter of an hour, please! I'll show you the shop. For my mom's sake. I'm neither a doctor, nor a priest. I'll explain everything. Quarter of an hour! The battery's dead. Fine, can I use your phone? Yes, of course. Please, as much as you like. I'll bring the phone to you. Tanya, where are you? Where's Igor? One minute, mom. Igor needs to make a phone call. Tanya, is Igor the first or that second one? Later, mom. I'll shine some light for you. Tanya! Bunny! I'm late. Me? At the meeting. Yes, it was so sudden... Yes... myself... Don't be cross, mousy! No, birdie, not for long! Have my passionate smooch. Ah? My prickly hedgehog! Cookoo! You'd better ask your birdie which house is her nest at. Listening. No, it's a flat. Who lives? I live here. Who do you need? What? She started swearing... I think it's for you. That hybrid of yours, probably. Who? Damn! Her phone has a number detector. What did she say? She said that even if I'm blonde, that must be fake, that she doesn't care about my legs even if they're growing out of my head, and that she doesn't give a damn about my sexy appearance, she doesn't care, I mean. At least she didn't offend you. You think so? You're wrong. She did? Of course! How? The usual. Oh, I'm sorry! Well, why... It's not your fault. She has a temper. She's twenty. Twenty? What do you talk about? We don't really talk much. Twenty! And she's jealous of me? Of you? You're seeing things. You know, it was more pleasant to talk to your mousy than to you. Let's go into the room. The phone is busy. Don't pick up! It's for me. Excuse me, but sometimes I also get calls in here. Sorry. Hold it. Listening! Ah, bunny! Yes, kitten, I'll call him now. Passing the phone, mousy, already. Hello to the hedgehog! Yes... I'm a womanizer? What legs? She doesn't even have legs! Why don't I? I very much do! Normal legs. Pretty even... Who's a blonde? She's fifty years old, at least! I swear. You're swearing for nothing. Yes, Tanya! Ta... What have you done? I've been chasing her for at least two weeks! Don't grab the phone in my house! It compromises me. What? You won't understand. Yes, listening. It's me. The ancient and legless one. I want to steal Igor from you. What are you saying? Give me the phone! Give me the phone! That's for me! They're asking for me. You better hold the pan. Yes, yes, bunny, I'm listening! How can you foresee that? Or predict? To receive such a desired present in my last days! One cannot know everything, just cannot! Who? Thank you! Who am I as well? Oh, no, that's a bit too much. You’re pleasing me. Yes, he's noble. He has good manners. And he's pretty handsome. Goodbye. The mousy said that you don't need to worry anymore. She’s got someone to spend the evening with. It's just dangerous to stay long at your place! What are you allowing yourself at your age! Do you have problems with my age? How old are you, for instance? I'm a man! So? Do men have one year as two? How old do I look like? About forty years old. Because it's dark here. I came to your place by mistake. Right? You slipped. Right? I acted like a gentleman... But you can't be a gentleman for five minutes. Better not be one at all then. What's wrong? Gastritis. Oh, let's eat something, then. And it will go away. C'mon, follow me. Porridge, that's it. I'll make porridge for you. Sit here. Right, be back soon. Tanya, are you insane? Champagne with porridge? Make something tasty! Alright, mom. And we'll talk in the meanwhile. We're in no hurry. What's the weather like today? Frosty? I don't know. And I always know. My legs are telling me, I haven't walked in ten years. Well, you're still too young of a man to understand me. And nothing probably hurts in your body. Nothing, yes. Eat faster! Tanya, we forgot about the roses! Put them in a vase! Eat, I'll be back soon. Don't eat! Better open the champagne. What are you doing? Why do you need this champagne out of a sudden? Let me open it. What do you need from this bottle? I'll open it myself. Eat. Don't eat! Tanya, I insist! It's a man's duty to open champagne! I'll manage! Oh! Sorry! Is the suit expensive? You restored it. Be back soon! That's alright. You eat. Eat, eat. Where have I come to? Tanya has never dealt with alcohol. She just doesn't know how to handle it. Our family doesn't drink at all. It's even awkward to confess. That's me when I was younger. Here! As good as new. Eat already, eat! Mom can't have it. You can't either. And I can. I will drink. Tanya, let Igor drink a bit. He doesn't look like an alcoholic. Thank you. Here's more porridge. Mom, here's for you, two drops in your tea. Tanya, please let Igor drink some! No, thank you, I'm driving. Oh, you're a driver! A wonderful occupation! I'm an auditor. What did you say? Auditor. I don't get it. An auditor is an accountant, mom. Oh, so you're an accountant! Why are you driving? An accountant behind the wheel... Strange! I have a car. Your own? My own. Where did you get it? What? Well, you had to get that car from somewhere! I bought it. Bought it. It wasn't easy, I guess. You had to give up a lot of things, save up all your life… Uh-huh. There was a time when I had to refuse myself a lot of things. Surprisingly, I didn't manage to save a single penny back then. But now, I'm just earning a lot. Working several jobs, perhaps? No need to exhaust yourself at this age. I propose to have a drink! I mean, for everyone to cheer, and for me to drink alone. After you! And after Tanya! For you to finally get it right this time! Oh, it hit already. She's not used to this. Our Tanya is so happy today! That's because of you, Igor! That's insane, so many years... We're drinking, and he's munching porridge over there. I haven't eaten porridge in like fifty years. Mom used to force me to. "Igor, eat your porridge, you'll grow strong". Here. I never listened. Did not grow a thing. Meek snake! Huh... It's very nice. Really? Allow me seconds? Come take a look at me! Please come, I'm alive, I'm in pain... Nobody warms these hands. These lips... said, ...enough. Every evening they bring my chair to the window. I see the road. I'll never reprimand you for the final sour taste of worry. I don't fear a thing... See, I forgot the words already. A poem by Ahmatova. Folklore music. Mom's. You're a great listener! Eatener. I love homemade food. You can recommend me as such to your friends. I like your Igor so much! So much! How did you find Tanya? I guess I just got lucky. Beautifully said! The words of a real man! You didn't even hope for it, perhaps? Couldn't even imagine! I would've laughed if I was told an hour ago that I would be having porridge for dinner in the company of these two wonderful ladies. A great toast! Raise your glasses! Tanya, you're drinking for three men today. What do you think, Igor, did Tanya change? For the better. Don't get carried away, Tanya. There should be a limit in both happiness and sorrow... You think Tanya is drinking a lot today? Oh no! I remember how much she could take back then!.. Outdrank them all! You allowed yourself to get drunk, Tanya? What are you saying? Oh, Sofya Ivanovna! I'll never forget how she danced on the tables! So many pubs were applauding her! You visited pubs? Men were all over her! I was going insane from jealousy! It's so true that mothers are the last ones to learn the truth about their daughters. Now I understand why you didn't marry Tanya back then! But now she's completely different! Oh, don't know! Oh, not sure! Igor has changed a lot as well, mom! He became braver! And today he finally proposed to me, in the kitchen. Tanya, you are getting married? To Igor? I'm so happy! I need to think, mom! Think? About what? Sofya Ivanovna, don't pressure Tanya! I will wait. Thank you, Igor, it was a nice evening. I know you're in a hurry. Mom is tired. Mom, we should let him go. Why? Don't let me go. Why? I'm not in a hurry anymore. I'd still eat something, though. I'm... getting... memories from 30 years ago. Who told you I'm tired? I'm not tired at all! On the contrary, thanks to Igor I feel wonderful, for the first time in many years. You will make a beautiful couple! Are you retiring soon? What am I going to do in retirement? I don't seek retirement. I prefer working. "What is there to do?" It's the best time to live! Buy some land, build a house! We have some savings. Tanya will be on gardening. Are you against having your own house in the fresh air? I'm not! I've got one already. You have a house? Where? On the Canary. Oh, the Canary... And the land? What is it? I mean, is there enough space? There is. And the house? Not too small? Not really. Is there a forest, a lake nearby? No. All of that is somewhat far away. How could you buy land without a forest or a lake? Well, do you have any plants there? Well, something must be growing I guess. And who's taking care of all this? Nobody. It grows by itself. Just listen to men! By itself, he says. What could be growing there by itself? Nettles? Oh, God knows. Oranges, I think. I don't come there often. No time. Oranges... How did you say? Canary? I've heard something about it, can't remember... Which way is it, Tanya? That's in Spain, mom. A land in Spain? So far away! Why? It must be so inconvenient! And costly. On the contrary, it's cheaper there. Tanya, do you understand anything? Yes, pretty much. Can you explain it to me? I will, mom. God! I'm so behind in life! I guess you can't survive without TV nowadays. In our times, nobody bought land in Spain... Ah, maybe it's not bad after all! I think life is becoming somewhat more... festive! Well, now I really should go. Nice to meet you. Thank you for the evening. No, no, Igor, I'm not letting you go! Have you been christened? Yes, as a child. Thank God! Then... stand here. Tanya, pass the icon, please! Mom, what are you up to? Tanya, I've got no time! I could die today! I feel I will die tomorrow! Or in a week, in the worst case! Don't idle. What's taking so long? Stand next to Igor. My children! Let the Lord bless you! Live long and peaceful! Treasure each other! Love each other! Have my blessings! Mom! Tanya, don't interrupt me! You know, these might be the best minutes in the life of any woman! I just remembered how your father and I were blessed. And your father gave me this engagement ring. You can't take it off. I will be buried with it. And then we married in a church. Tanya, put the icon back. What do you think about marrying in a church, Igor? In a church? It's beautiful. Tanya, you must promise me that you and Igor will get married in a church. Don't make hasty decisions, mom. Tanya is very proud, Igor. She never chased after men. Unlike her friend. She had a friend once... Mom, Igor has no interest whatsoever listening about this friend. You're wrong, I'm interested in everything. So, she had a friend, and when this friend saw a suitable man, she'd pretend to have slipped and fallen. And she’d grab the man, well, for him to walk her home... She was married eight times, Igor! Eight times! And Tanya never did. When is the wedding? We will have a wedding, right? A modest one. A modest one, but certainly a wedding. Yes, Sofya Ivanovna, but us, financial workers, have those annual balance sheets to produce now... I wouldn't want to pile all of this up... the wedding, the sheets... No, piling up is no good... When is the report due? First of March. Then the quarterly one on the 15th of April, then... I won't live till then! I have a feeling. I've got one or two weeks left, no more. And if I die, you'd postpone the wedding for a year because of the mourning! Well, who's going to mou... Let's gather all together! You come early tomorrow, please. We'll have a cosy evening. And decide everything once and for all. No, no, no mom. We can't do it, tomorrow Igor is leaving on a business trip. What business trip? - For how long? - Half a year. And what about the balance sheet? He'll write it during the trip and send it over here. If it wasn't for me, Tanya could've joined you! I've always been a burden in Tanya's life! Mom, do you realise where you want me to go? Where do I want you to go? To the tundra, the eternal permafrost. Go around on dog sleighs, eat fish... raw. Ditch this job then, Igor! Well, somebody has to... Igor will be calling us. From the yurt? Better write letters. I still have the letters saved. From Tanya's father. If trenches had phones, what would I have been left with today? Be careful... for us! I've grown attached to you like to my own son! If I'd stayed longer, you would've sent me to a different galaxy, without missing a beat. Are you angry? Well, I worry a bit, that I gave a word to marry you in front of an icon. It's nothing, forget it. Well, I wouldn't want any issues with the Lord Almighty. Don't think I've got a sense of humour for such things. Why do you think you were swearing in front of an icon? YOU were the only one drinking here. Did you even look at whatever you were swearing? I gave her the portrait of Dickens. Do you have a sense of humour for Dickens? How fortunate! He, too, loves Dickens! That friend, who married eight times, is an angel compared to you. Yes? Well, I wish you all the best with your long-legged hedgehog, with your blond kitten, with your sexy bunny, and with the rest of your zoo. - Thank you, thank you. - You're welcome. Thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye. - Tomorrow I'll visit your mom. - All right. I'll be here anyways... Never found out her house number... Ah, goodness gracious, you certainly will! Have I offended you? No, you were incredible. I even managed to stay a gentleman. Your rating? - Highest rating! - Yes? But you can't be a gentleman for one night. Shouldn't have started in the first place if so. I'm interested, what are you going to make up if I never show up again? Kill me in a car accident? Push me on a gangster knife? Give me a terminal illness? You have no idea how imaginative I am! Well, why? I have an idea now. Don't you remember anything at all? Remember what? What? I will be reading your letters to my mom. Letters? Ah, from the tundra? Just be modest. Don't read the intimate parts out loud. Please forgive me. For what? Well, for sucking you into this story. Mom wants me to get married. Let her believe that her dream came true. Maybe this deception will prolong her life. Sorry for wasting you evening because of us. Sorry for what? It was a good evening. I will definitely visit you again! Not in the world, please. Why, am I this unlikable? I'm afraid you've made too much of a good impression... on me. Glad to know. Well, maybe because everything was in place: the flowers, champagne, the candles. You look great. Even with the lights on. You have a wonderful mother. I would visit her... Her!... again. No, you don't have to come here anymore. Goodbye. Nice to meet you. Mom! What's wrong? Do you have pains? Horrible! Why is everything so horrible! You guessed it? Immediately! I'm not deaf or mute, I still have the head on my shoulders! Sorry! Sorry? For what? For what? For that you love him so much? You got so lucky this time! He loves you so much! Yes, I could see it. Tanya, you two will be very happy. Why the tears then? It still burdens me. What burdens you? It's my fault, Tanya. It was so nice living with you. But deep down I always worried that you'd ditch me and marry someone... and now I've been punished... Severely punished! I want a granddaughter! And I will never have one. God, I want a granddaughter so much! For her to love me. And love you, of course. For all of us to love each other. And I would've been waiting for great-grandchildren instead of death right now. Great-grandchildren are wonderful, you know. They make so much noise, run around the house... Well, there are the worries, of course... All those tantrums, trouble... Yes. And instead of this, because of me, you sit here all day, with a boring granny. I love you so much, mom! I enjoy living with you. It's late! So late... It's so incredibly, horribly late when we finally realise our mistakes! Stop stressing out! Leave the drops! Is that all you can give me at the end of my life! Igor is such an interesting man! And you're so beautiful! You would've had such a wonderful girl! Forgive me, Tanya! I'm such an egoist. Why were you so obedient? Why, daughter? I'm still happy that you're getting married. Still happy! Mom, I don't need anyone. Are you crazy? Yes. I'm happy! And you? Me too! Why are we so unhappy then? Everything will be alright. I congratulate you! Thank you! I'm really, really happy, mom! "Then, there was Mrs Nickleby, so grand and complacent; Madeline and Kate, so blushing and beautiful; Nicholas and Frank, so devoted and proud; and all four so silently and tremblingly happy..." "...so subdued yet so overjoyed, and there were the twin brothers so delighted and interchanging such looks, that the old servant..." It suits you. This great-grandmother's bow is at least a century old. Can you finally explain what's going on? Is it a special day today? Just a regular day, mom. It's bright outside, the sun is shining! Don't play with my head, Tanya! I can see it. You've been cooking all day. Are you waiting for someone? Beautiful! Igor? No, it's not Igor. Who, then? Wait! Who is this? The neighbour boy is having fun again. I'll show him if I catch him. Did Igor leave? I think he's on his way already. Far from Moscow. There's something mysterious in the atmosphere of our house. What awaits us? Tanya, what awaits us? Dumplings, salad, cake. Did you invite somebody? It's a surprise! For you. You're off on a business trip, remember? Can't you hear? The dog sleigh is barking at the entrance. I'll jump on board in half an hour. And sprint right to the tundra. Came here only to say goodbye to my bride. Godspeed. No, I need to rest, catch my breath... regain my strength... You know, the age and all... Gastritis. How is your mom feeling? The roses are for her, by the way. Thanks, but she hasn't run out of yesterday's ones yet. Well, let her have more. No, you better spoil your bunny with those. Tanya, who's there? Nobody, mom! It's just me, Sofya Ivanovna! Why are you not coming in, Igor? He's in a hurry! In a hurry to see you, Sofya Ivanovna! Well, where? Where? C'mon! Coming! Hurrying! Sprinting! I'm so glad you came! Tanya didn't say anything about you! But I sensed it! She was waiting for you so badly! She was getting ready, tidying up. Bought so much stuff. I'm glad to know you were waiting for me so badly, Tanya! I wasn't waiting for you. Who were you waiting for then, if not for Igor? I thought you'd left. I'm surprised. Pleasantly surprised? Just surprised. Right, Igor, take your jacket off. Feel yourself at home. Tanya, put the roses in the vase. We only have one vase. Understood, I'll bring a second one tomorrow. And what should I do with your roses today? Throw them away. Children, don't argue... Tanya, take off his jacket and sort out the roses. The trip was postponed! Cancelled altogether! My dream was right. Imagine, I had a dream of a road with a big pile of... Sorry, but that leads to happiness. Imagine, I had the very same dream: a road and the same pile of... Tanya, can you imagine, Igor and I had the same dream! What dream? We saw... I forgot. But I remembered when you came in. What could you possibly dream of in such a sync? It's my and Sofya Ivanovna's shared, little secret. How do you feel, Sofya Ivanovna? Excellent! I had a dream that came true! You came! We can dine now! Everyone is here. Sadly, Igor has a train to catch. Tell her, Igor. She doesn't even know what happy news are waiting for her. Can you imagine, Tanya, the trip got cancelled altogether! Yes. We can celebrate New Year together! Yes, but Tanya hasn't invited me yet. Well, the New Year is far away! It's in a week. Mom, sadly, Igor can't celebrate with us. - Why? - He's celebrating with his colleagues in a restaurant. With the colleagues. It's a tradition. Igor will phone us on the day. You think that's normal? The world has changed, mom. A land in Spain, New Year with colleagues in a restaurant, with all sorts of hedgehogs involved, ferrets... It's normal, mom. You must marry as soon as possible! Igor, I have to remind you that it's time. Why? The trip got cancelled, Tanya! Yes. But the balance sheet is still a thing. Igor, I beg you - go and do not return without the sheet. What's wrong, Igor? She knows... Gastritis? Give me a piece of bread. The pain is unbearable. I need to eat something immediately. Tanya, c'mon! Do something! C'mon, serve the table, hurry up! Igor, you need to sit down. It's important for me not to move right now. I need to take a seat... for about five hours. At least. Please do! We would be glad! Or lie down. I don't understand, what's wrong with our Tanya today? She was waiting for you for so long. But seemed to get upset when you actually came. Really? I haven't noticed. Is it broken? What is she doing there? Can you make it to the kitchen? Yes, I'll try. It's good you came here. I'll feed you here. Quick. I'm in no hurry, don't worry. This bow suits you. I can't help but compliment your taste. Don't get distracted, sit here. Enjoy! Vinaigrette. Salad. Sorry. You can't have that. Bread... Why put everything on one plate? Cheese. Butter. Don't be like that to me! The plate is big, everything will fit. Eat! Why do you keep me in the kitchen? It insults my basic human pride. C'mon, chew faster. Why are hurrying me all the time? I'm nervous because of you. I'm restless thinking about your gastritis. My personality is not defied by gastritis only. It's nice, by the way. I haven't eaten this well in a while. Want more? Thanks, I'll restrain myself. Or I'd eat here and then sit in the room like a fool. Watching you eat. What do you want from me? Honestly? Yes. If completely honest, I don't know myself. I'm not here. Do you get calls here already? Listening! Ah? Yes, I recognise your chirping. Igor? He's here, of course. Where else can he be? Igor! Igor! Your kitten is calling! You have a horrible personality. As expected of an old maid. Please don't talk for long. I might get a call. Yes. Cookoo! Today? Well, hard to say... A cookooing kitten! Ecology got ruined completely. No, no, don't cancel anything because of me... It's alright if you're busy. I'll call you. Bye-bye, my prickly hedgehog! I'm reminding you that we're not a phone office or a hotline. There's a queue, kitten, and they're banging on the window already. Hurry to your mousy, she's waiting! - I'll call you back, hedgehog! - I'm waiting for someone. Who are you waiting for? A new candidate for a husband? But your mom is already attached to ME. Don't traumatise her. I just want to know, how do I not fit? Your mom doesn't have anything against me. What do you want? I'm waiting for a guest, you're an extra. - What do you want? - Nothing special. I like these lamps, I like a full table. Got sick of restaurants... It's been a long time since anyone was as happy to see me as your mother. Imagine, I've never been a son-in-law in my whole life. Then go marry your bunny. I'm too young for her. - You? Too young for her? - Of course! I'll survive for twenty more years maybe. And she's dreaming of becoming a widow, not a wife. Why do you need her if you talk like that? Why? I'm a man after all. Ah, right. Tanya, are we going to eat? One minute, mom! - Right, right... - Right, we're on the way, Sofya Ivanovna! Let's go. Leave immediately! With the vinaigrette? How can I, I'm a man of values! Quiet! Vinaigrette - in the room, you - out of the room. Don't show yourself. Yes, sir! Why are you still here? Just interested to see who came. C'mon! Too ashamed to show me? By the way, how should I introduce myself? Your fiance? Your fake fiance, or your ex-fiance? I'm confused. Let's work it out. Oh, he's very persistent! He must be craving to marry you. That's from the district services. C'mon, leave. Maybe I should work for the district services? Go! You get well-prepared for their visits! Here I am! Dina! Hello! Your daughter! Yours... the only one... ...was found. Tanya, who's there? Grandma! Grandma, my love! We have finally met! Tanya, help! Dina, Dina, don't do it like this, do it slowly... Do you know her? Who is she? Grandma! Do you not recognise your only one? Do you want me to throw this only one out of here? Right, who is this? You didn't warn me! That's my daughter, mom! Your granddaughter. Granny, my lovely one! My mommy! Enough! Stop screaming and throwing yourself on everyone's necks. Don't shout at the child! I don't understand, who is this? My God, my heart is beating so fast! Don't torture me, Tanya, who is she? Your granddaughter, mom. Sorry for hiding that. O Lord! A granddaughter! Mine! I better not go nuts. Right... Where were you hiding her, Tanya? Oh, she gave me up... right in the hospital. And some strangers adopted me instead. They themselves had seven kids... all of them were alcoholics. That's what my life has been, my orphaned life, with my mother and grandmother alive. You rejected your child, Tanya? I won't let attack my mother. Is that all true, Tanya? All true! It's my fault! Grandma! I can't stop looking at you! My beautiful unfinished song! It's all my fault! Forgive me! Ah c'mon, grandma, forget about it! Were you scared of me, my girl? Was I really such a monster? Forgive me, my girls. Mom, mom, don't worry. It wasn't like that, I'll tell you the truth. Don't! The truth is too sour! And I've grown up already! What is there to explain now? Let me take a look at you! Well, what's your name? Dina. Tanya's eyes. And my chin. Petya's brows. Right, Tanya? He didn't live to see her. My chin and his brows! Or mine? No, let them be his. His, of course! Whose else? Looks do get passed through generations. Tanya's eyes. And Tanya's forehead! The contour, I mean. Look at the forehead, Igor! I admire the forehead. And the nose? Whose nose is it? Give me at least a hint or something?.. Who is it? I am an extra in this particular celebration of life. Igor, would you really judge Tanya for a child out of wedlock? After all this time... Who am I to judge her for anything? What do you mean "who"? You're almost married! Yes! I was almost ready to marry a woman who assured me that she's an old maid! An old maid is something touching, romantic, strict, helpless. And now it turns out that she's been leading a double life for all those years! Bunnies and hedgehogs have more tact than her. They're at least straightforward! I'm going on the trip after all. I'll call from the tundra. Right from the snowdrift. Who is he? Your father. Who? Your daddy! Daddy? Daddy! Daddy, my lovely daddy! We have finally met each other! I had no idea I have a father! I needed you so much! Stop it! I won't buy this trick. Igor, are you rejecting your own daughter?! I'm starting to get disappointed in you, Igor! I never had children! Never had children! No girlies, no sonnies. My Tanya can't lie, Igor! You should know that better than anyone. Yes, I have... have noticed. How old are you? Dad, let's not talk about... How old are you, I ask? Don't shout at the child! How old are you, darling? Don't be afraid, tell daddy. 26, so what? 26! Wow! I was doing completely different things back then. I’ve been on duty as a lawful citizen! Served in the army. In Vorkuta, far away from here. And you, Tanya? And I worked in Elts, got sorted there after the librarian university. Were you in Elts? Never! I visited Vorkuta from Elts. You? From Elts to Vorkuta? Why? A tourist trip. Oh... Was it... the May holidays, by any chance? Igor, come closer. What? Yes, the nose is definitely yours. Take a closer look. What a Mexican soap opera... Dad, why worry now? What do you lose? Too late for child support, plus I've got a place to live. You can only gain from me. The final days are not far away, and you have a daughter already. Someone who can pass you a glass of water. Right, enough! You're tiring the child out! Enough, all sorted! Let's have dinner. Well, tell us. How did your life go without us? Was it a life even? The parents lost custody over me because of continuous drinking. What parents? Well, the ones that adopted me. I don't even consider them parents! Why so harsh? They did raise you. Then I waddled around in the orphanage. Then in social housing... I don't believe a thing! Tanya, you knew how much your daughter was suffering and kept quiet! How could she know? We lost each other right after the hospital. And how did you meet? Yes, my God! How did you meet? By chance! Literally yesterday! Amazing! How did you recognise each other? A call of the blood? One sec. Here. What is this stuff? My dowry! Clothes, napkins, everything my mom had left me! A Mexican soap opera! I am tearing up. There, only for you. Mom's marks in the corners. Still don't believe it? That's strange! Grandma, say it's strange not to believe after this! Show me! Tanya's style. Sofya Ivanovna! You're a clever woman! No, but it is really Tanya's style. But it's sewn... somewhat blurry... You left your marks on the napkins when you abandoned the child? Of course! Like a cookoo mother. Don't you dare talk like that to my mother! - Want dumplings? - Nope. Poor girl! Suffered so much! Always alone! Alone. But now I have mom and you, grandma! Sincere! Beautiful! Why didn't you marry anyone? Oh, do you know how many times I've been married? Just five official marriages alone! My whole passport is trashed. Do you have kids? No. It's alright, though. We need to move in together! Live together! Tanya, bring the box in. I would be glad to, but I've got nothing to move in with. You've got a palace! And I have a hole in a communal flat. C'mon, bring it in. We've got two rooms, you have one... We can apply for a flat with three rooms! You don't have to live with strangers anymore. We'll be together. Who is this? Your grandfather. Oh... Look, granddaughter! Holy hell! This is like a museum! Tretyakov Gallery, no less! Wow! A diamond diadem. Treasure, for sure. So beautiful. A TV-shop. A necklace... with different-sized pearls. A bracelet... Privalov! A serf, by the way. 17th century. Diamond pendants. Treasure! Have you robbed a museum? No, these are family jewels. Inherited by the female line. So you got all of it? From your mom? My mom. And she got it from her grandmother? From her great-grandmother. She was such a beauty! Stylish! She loved jewellery and kept buying it all her life. She was a some sort of noblewoman then? During the tsarist times? Mom, help. Hold this. Your great-grandmother was a serf. She was a singer in Italy and in France. A singer. - A serf? - Yes. Naomi... Campbell! So, all these jewels are yours, then? No. Now they're all... yours. You are such a treasure to me, granddaughter! Such a treasure! And for Tanya as well... such a treasure... Thank God! Someone to leave the jewellery to! Thanks to you, I will die happy! Don't, grandma! Please live! Child, let's take these off, put them away. You will know that they are yours. You will visit us and look at them. So complicated! Let her have them! Take them, Dina! Grandma, are you really going to give those to me? I already did. That’s... tsarist jewellery! Crazy money! Worth of several cars! But we're not giving them away to a stranger, but to the only daughter and granddaughter. Grandma! My lovely one! Thank you so much! Daddy, my beloved! Don't! Don't touch me. Alright. Mommy, my only one! Thank you for finding me! I'll be wearing this jewellery and thinking of you. Why think of me? I want to be with you while I'm alive! Because I have a feeling that I have a month or two left to live... Of course. But now it's time. I've got to get up early and all. Dina, aren't you going to stay for the night? Of course, next time! It's like I went insane today! Am I sleeping? Do you realise it's dangerous to walk around like that, all covered in diamonds? Yes. Look at me! What idiot is going to rob me? Grandma! Mom! Dad! Thank you! Thanks for everything! Love you all! Will never forget this day. Careful on the stairs. The neighbour boy always chews on his bananas and throws us all the peels. I'm not scared of bananas! I work with bananas. O Lord, keep my treasure safe! Can you explain what all of that was? What? An amateur and talentless performance. If I knew that I had a daughter and that she would be treated this way... I would've taken the girl in. She would've been raised in my house, she would've been loved, she would've been treasured, spoiled... And my mom would've lived longer. I'm not here. You tell them then. Yes! Why are you talking to me like that?! My daughter is twice your age! And stop calling here! Yes, I've got my mother-in-law and my daughter here. And she's not my wife, yes. It just happened. Got a mother-in-law, a daughter, but she’s not a wife. It happened, yes. I lied? Lied about what? I got there. Yes, by accident. By accident! Yesterday - by accident, today - not by accident, yes. For a while! Stop calling here! Thank you. Personally, I am ready to sacrifice myself for atoning the sins of the past. In what sense? Literally. Don't scare me. Even if we get married, nothing horrible would happen anyway. Why risk it? You can't be thinking just about yourself. You still need to create a family. You, your mother, your daughter. Wait, did you believe it? I'm starting to recall. A lot of time had passed, sorry. I met you yesterday for the first time in my life! I've never been to Vorkuta! Never given birth. Dina is a cashier from the veg shop at the corner. I don't even know her phone number! I don't even know her last name! Do you think I'm an idiot? You give her the jewellery and don't ask her name! Maybe your jewellery is fake as well? Maybe everything about you is fake? The jewellery is real, the life is real too. The daughter is fake! My mom is dying and I will do anything so she would die happy! Is Dina your daughter or not? Don't shout! Is she your daughter or not? - No! - Who is she? - Nobody! She's a nobody to you. My mom is a nobody to you. And I am a nobody to you. Monster. You are a monster! A cruel, cold-blooded woman! I'm crossing you out from my memory. I'm not imposing my company on you. And I'm not holding you. Not holding me, really? Forget everything? Erase everything? You can do that, I can't. It's alright, you can. Say hi to the kitten. My God, I'm so unhappy! Did Igor phone today? Mom, you already asked. Igor phones every day. What does he say? That he loves. Whom? Us. And in more detail? He's worried. About what? About your health. Do you only talk about me? Not only. Does he love you? Of course. And do you love him? No doubt, mom. I don't like any of this. Here's the snowgirl. You chewed on it as a child. And where's Dina? I told you, mom, she's ill. - Ill? - I told you, mom. Just a cold. You treat it like that because you didn't raise her. At the beginning, every illness looks harmless. Oh! Father brought it from Germany! And the consequences could be different! No need to worry. It's just a cold. Do you like the tree? Why are you lying? Do you think I don't see what's going on with you? I think it's very pretty. Yes, very. I love you, mom. Then leave me immediately and go to Igor! Mom, but it's impossible! Tanya, daughter, I'm pleading you with my last strength! Please go to Igor! I want you to meet New Year with Igor so much. Mom, I can't leave you alone. Do you want to spoil the day for me? Do you want me to suffer and worry for you all night? He might meet another woman while we're sitting here. Who, mom? Igor! Tanya, if he ditches us, I won't survive it! I don't want to go anywhere. Do it for me. I'm ready. Why the morbid look? Come here. Smile. There we go! That's better. I am happy that you're leaving me this night! Mommy, I too wish you good health, happiness, and many years to live. Well, I won't last long... maybe a year or two... Mom, should I stay? Go, I said! Say hi to Igor! And the gift? A gift for Igor? It's New Year! Ah, sure, I'll get something on the way. For Igor? On the way?! How can you? How can you, "something"? Mom, don't worry, I'll figure... I figured it out already! Our 30 volume edition. Igor loves Dickens just like us! To me! "....there was Newman so subdued yet so overjoyed, and there were the twin brothers..." One moment, Igor! Dina, my dear granddaughter! My beautiful one. I'm no good for anything! Keep calling, Igor, keep calling. One moment! One moment... Just a moment! Just a moment! Charlie, to me! Charlie! No, Charlie! Happy New Year! Happy holidays! It's me, your daughter! Dina, you?! You recognised me. I just wanted to go to you. I thought, it's New Year, you won't kick me out. But you got kicked out yourself, I see. Dina! - ...with your stuff. - It's so great! My mom sent me to Igor to celebrate New Year. - To whom? - To your dad. Right. I haven't seen a real Ded Moroz in years! There, there... My crutches are pretty real as well. Real?! What happened? God punished me, Tanya. How come? Punished for nothing? Well, he gave the honour to that boy who eats bananas in your house and throws the peels around. I'll kill him if I see him. I don't understand, Dina. I'm sorry, Tanya, I have to talk to you. Let's talk. I really need to. Well, let's go together maybe, to confess? Are you crazy? To confess? Don't take my grandma away from me! She's the only one I have! I don't have any relatives. Only her! Then let's call each other properly. Don't mess it up. I'm the mom, got it? Easy. Sincerely. We'll hold together. Mom! Mom! Mom! She could've gone to the loo. She hasn't walked in 10 years! A kidnapping! Bad times nowadays! Everyone gets kidnapped. Mom. Why are you back? Did something happen? I'm old Moroz from the forest! With a silver beard! Cheerful and rad as always! Happy New Year, kiddos! Who is this? Don't get scared, mom, it's our Dina. She decided to surprise us. Granddaughter! That's a funny thing you made up! You're so clever! Ded Moroz on crutches! I've never seen anything like this before! So funny! What does it mean? It means... both legs are broken. And you argued with me! “Just a cold, not dangerous”. See what it can grow into sometimes? And what's up with you today? You're strange. Careful, mom. I will never fall anymore! Not when a happy and quiet life has finally begun! All my presents are shiny and great! A camera for you, grandma. A camera! For me! Thank you! You know, I had a camera once, "Leika". Yes. My father gave it to me when I turned 18. Oh, so beautiful! "Leika" was also beautiful... It was so nice, the lens would move in and out. I used to take many pictures, but forgot everything now. There's nothing to learn! Nothing easier! Here, I'll teach you. We've got the whole night ahead. Here's for you, mom. A dress. I've spent all the money you gave me on this. Thank you, Dina. Hang some family stuff on yourself as well. Put it on, mom! Yes, there were lots of things in my youth. I had hobbies... Took pictures of your grandad. Grandad?! What grandad? Well, hello! "What grandad?" Pyotr Alexandrovich. I've got lots of pictures of him. Ah, grandad. Here's a second tree ready. The more festive, the better. Wow! Princess Frog! The queen of the hill! A beauty! A malachite casket! And now, get out! New Year is close. Grandma, where are you kicking mom out to? To your father! To Igor! And we'll be having fun here! It's going so well. Mom. Oh! How are you here? Let's say goodbye to the old year. Take this. Are we going to drink on the stairs like alcoholics? But we should drink! Better drink on the staircase than not to drink at all. It's evident. Without snacks? You want everything at once! It's important to drink now. I'll bring the snacks later. Well, after the old year, let it burn in hell. Hooray! Hooray! We need to talk. Let's have one more. Cause I don't know when I get a chance to come out again. Slower, slower, take it slow. Or you'll get drunk and end up lying on the staircase, covered in diamonds. Wow, it's already too much. Drink or you'll catch a cold. Close your eyes and drink. Ah, what was I going to say? I'm pregnant myself. What to do? I don't even know. Don't open your eyes, c'mon, drink, don't stop. I haven't drunk that much, but I already see two Ded Morozes. Well, we'll have a third glass then, and you'll be sipping from the bottle. A drink for three on a staircase. What a life. Do you know who that is? Of course. Who? Ded Moroz. Right. Dina? Dina! Where are you? Mom, sniff a branch so you won't get drunk. C'mon. I'll be back! With champagne! You decided to celebrate New Year here? Yes. So what? Nothing, nothing. I guess I like it. Can I celebrate with you? Well, tell me, why do I need two Ded Morozes? Understood, I'm leaving. I'm sorry, the joke was bad. Why are you stripteasing in front of me? Ded Moroz became a clown. I... must apologise. About the slap? That's my best memory! Am I drunk? It's New Year. You must be sorry, right? I'm admiring you. You're incredibly beautiful. Clown. I have a present for you. I have one for you too. I'll get drunk today! Pour me... 20 drops! Right in the tea! It's a gift. Remi Martin. I was saving it the whole year. Haven't you poured yourself too much, dear? Don't worry! There's enough booze. I've brought champagne too. Well, after the old year, let it go to hell. O God, forgive me! Here comes hooray. Give me your hand... the right one. I won't! Oh, that was the left one. Let's figure out the right one. Here it is. Please double-check or I could be mistaken again. Where's the heart? God, the heart is here. The right one. Why do you need it? Oh. I'm nervous. What if you won't like it, or it won't fit... Why? It fits. I like it. The clock is working! It was broken for a decade! Happy New Year! Don't get distracted, don't get distracted. Happy New Year! Oh, hi, dad. - Hi. - Why are you here? The clock is ticking! Bring the bag. New Year is a family celebration. You can't have it on the staircase. Vanya, c'mon! Everyone is at the table already! Kill ya! So what? Do I give birth or not? Yes! Mom, you will be a great-grandmother! And I will be a grandad?! Well, thanks! I will have a great-granddaughter! So much has happened while I was dying! Granny, I love you so much! My only one! Just hurry! I feel I won't stay with you for long. Do not plead me! Three or four years, not more! Piper-Heidsieck! Sofya Ivanovna! But I have a burden! What burden, mom? The child must have a father! A daddy! If only I had any idea who that could be! Get ready. I don't want to listen to this, Dina, my beauty! - Funny, gentle, honest! Only one thing can console me. - Eleven! My great-grandchild must have a father! Strange, why are they knocking and not ringing? Go, go. Go, don't be afraid. Ask who is it.
