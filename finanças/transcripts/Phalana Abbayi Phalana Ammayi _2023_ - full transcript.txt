But you didn't give them an advance I asked for two days time. That's not how it works. By the way, I too am searching for a roommate. Is it? Can I trust you? Upto you. There's a lot of people showing interest. No need. Let's finish our dinner and check out the room. Till then, accept this pickle as an advance. Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. How many pickled peppers did Peter Piper pick? Say it in a loop. Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. How many pickled peppers did Peter Piper pick? You turn now. I'm a friend of Anupama's, sir. An up am a who? Second year, Mech. How do you know her? School mates, sir. Which school? Brilliant Grammar High School. You are not bluffing, are you? Believe me, sir. I was in 2B and she was in 3A. We have been friends since then. Okay. You may go. May I go as well? Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. How many pickled peppers did Peter Piper pick? What happened? Why don't you introduce An up am a to me as well? I can't tolerate the ragging anymore. They were asking me to salute them with my pants unzipped. An up am a? She said she won't come to college for another seven days. Sanjay! Are we childhood buddies? They were trying to rag me... So you went to Brilliant Grammar High School? I was in 3B and you were in 2A, is it? No. I was in 2B and you were in 3A. Shut up. Hi! Are you An up am a? I heard that you are childhood buddies. Please save me from the evil, An up am a! Please save me too, Oh great An up am a! Please save me, Oh senior student... Hey, stop it. I mean... What is your father's name? Hanumanth Rao. And your mother? Tell me. A run a! What does she do? Housewife. I'm talking to you; Why are you leaving? You touched a sensitive topic. His mom died last year. I found it out just yesterday. Hi, did you face any difficulty finding our room? What are you doing here, An up am a? Ma'am... I'm planning a skit. I need a fresher to participate. You said you liked acting. I thought you'd be interested. A skit? - For the farewell? - Yes. I want to perform on stage, too. But I'm scared. That's okay. You'll get over it. I'll put your name down. Okay. See you. Is that what you are here for? Actually, I came here to apologise. But apologies need not be said, it's enough if you feel sorry. - Nagarjuna! - Father! It's farewell day today in our college Do you know what's a Farewell party? What is it? It's the day all the Seniors leave our college... I'm feeling very sad, Nagarjuna. What about you? I'm also very sad. Really. There are many people out there. They are enjoying the event. Thank you. I'm getting a chance because of you to get onto the stage. Excuse me. What are you doing? What are you performing on the stage? I'll be singing a song, sir. And you? We are going to do a skit, sir. We don't have that much time. I can allow only one of you to perform. (Student singing) What happened to you? I was so excited about this day. I even got a camera from Valentine's church. Video camera? Are we rolling? Should I press the red button? It's recording! Are we really rolling? - Action? - Action! Why are you blushing? I'm not. It happens to me. You said it was your life's dream. And that it was your ultimate goal... Did I say so? You were the one that put my name down. Don't you have any respect for your senior? Come on... Action! Come on. Not this skit. Please... Come on. Come on. No, no... Please cut it... Please... Let's do something else. Please... The first presentation in the Janaranjani program me is a skit written by An up am a and Sanjay filled with fun... and entertainment. A short play. Requested by Mallik, Sai, and Nitin from Jalarpet, and Srinivas and Sagar from Chavulamadum. He is lying. Nobody requested it. We were eager to perform it but nobody wanted us, because... Come my sweet bird, I want you. You should ring the bells of passion in my heart. Prakash Rao sir... That is why it is said that one should not trust people with round faces. Hello, even my face is round. No! You have an oval face... Your face? I too have an oval face. My sister's? Oval face. - My mother's? - Round face. You are a bit crazy, you know! You are crazier than me, you know! ...to obtain an accurate result through a FEM model. Typically, the smaller the mesh size the more accurate the solution. Got it? So, at what point do we stop refining the mesh? We continue to refine the mesh until the results are no more than 0.5% different. But finding a mesh means more computing time. The elements in the mesh... Sanjay! Sanjay! All you had to do was to ask her out And you made a mess of it. It was Anupama's idea. Didn't you call me a genius for the same idea? Ideas seem brilliant when you get them.. But the shit goes downtown during the execution phase. It's burning. Is it? Wait a minute. Hello, Ms. An up am a? Do you plan to help us? Or are you waiting to be fed? It was you who accepted the challenge. Yes, it was me. But now... I doubt my talent. Okay. - Pass me the onions. - Onions... You have chopped only this much all this while? - Eggs? - Eggs... Eggs It smells delicious. I know. Is it done It's not? You go first. Okay? You'll eat second, right? You eat. I'll eat out. Hi! I had a small argument with my friends. They say you are not supposed to ask for a girl's number if you don't know her for at least a week. What do you say? Where is Keerti? She is in the department. Where is Valentine? He is watching a movie at my house. Which movie? [watching movie] Hi, An up am a. This is Giri. If you remember, we exchanged our numbers yesterday. Please give me a call when you get this message. - Giri called. - Okay. Tell. He asked me out for a coffee. What did you say? I said I'll think about it. He said he thought we were a couple. What? Don't be so shocked. A lot of people think the same about us. Who are those people? The ones who don't know about us. But it's not their fault. We should not give them a chance to misunderstand us. We do go a little overboard when we are in public. You know there is a saying in Telugu... "Since mother can't follow her son everywhere, she packs her handmade pickle for him" What does that mean? Your mother, when she can't go with her son everywhere, she buys mangoes, cuts them into pieces, and puts them in... What is it called? What is 'aava' in English? I don't know. The small seeds used in tempering. Forget it. It's not working in English. Mustard! Let's do one thing. Whenever you cross your limits, I'll warn you. - What? - What, what? Do I cross my limits? No. I'll warn you if you cross the limits and you warn me if I cross the limits. Okay? Let's see. - Let's see. - Let's see. It's you. How shall we warn each other? Shall we have a code word? Thank you. I... I really enjoyed the movie. Yeah? Hold on. One second... One second... - Yeah? Stay here. - Okay. Kafifi? Kafifi? It's very short. We can disguise it in cough or sneeze. How? Kafifi. Kafifi. Kafifi. Kafifi. Kafifi. Kafifi. You remember the song from the movie? You are my pickle and I'm your ice cream. This is the pickle. For you... Thank you. Kafifi. We can do that too. Kafifi! - I gave away the pickle. - What? I gifted her a jar of pickles. What kind of gift is that? But it worked out for me. She invited us to her birthday party. I'm scared. Why? I heard Valentine practising a song. Which song? Some English song from a Telugu movie. Does he want to spoil his love story even before it started. I don't know. Hey... Kafifi? Yes. But the fries are good. Kafifi. "This East and that West" (Valentine singing song) "When they unite at the Auspicious time..." "Western sunset tunes are adorning the feet..." "Ting... Ting... Ting... Ting..." "You aavakai.. Me ice cream." "This is the hot and sweet loves dream." "United states of hearts we have like Indian Namaste." Now I invite my friends Sanjay and An up am a onto the stage, please. No, we will not come. No, no, no. I have nominated you. You must come. Keerti, you must join them too. May I have your attention, please? So, this song is called... Kafifi. We just made it up. Actually, we are going to make it up as we are going to sing. So... Kafifi! Ka... Fifi! Kafifi! "When in public, When the desire to display affection arises," "Kafifi is something that keeps them both in check." "Kafifi differentiates love and lust" "Makes you understand the true meaning of love And keeps you within your limits." "A strange company that has no boundaries and sprints carefree is not acceptable." "It's a line that separates us such that no one will ever look down upon us with a condemning question of "what will happen next?" Kafifi! Ka... Fifi! Kafifi! "When we laugh together at a joke and when the people around us don't get that joke..." "When they doubt what is happening between us and are curious about our relationship..." "During our untimely outings" "the closeness that we share." "When people all along the way speculate our behaviour..." "It is the boundary that lets us walk in dignity." Kafifi! Ka... Fifi! Kafifi! "When there are no permissions required to claim what is yours and what is mine..." "There will be no restrictions amongst us." "But can we convince the ones who see it from a different perspective?" "Will they trust us?" "It's a line that separates us such that no one will ever look down upon us with a condemning question of "what will happen next?" In which language? Whichever they understand... - Hello. - Hello. My thesis proposal got accepted. Oh! Congrats. Congrats. Thank you. Did you hear the title? It's a foot long. 'Application of the New IEC International Design Standard for Offshore Wind Turbines... to a Reference Site in the Brighton Offshore Wind Energy Area' Wow! You may be awarded the degree just for remembering this name. - Yes. - When is your defence? Maybe in Summer. But my sister is getting married. So... if I go to India during the summer then the defence would be in the fall. What does the groom do? He is an investment banker at Parkley's. Kafifi. Sanjay. Where are you going? I'm getting late for the class. Bye. What's up girls? - What are you cooking? - Dal! Shit, I shouldn't have given away the pickles. I must say you girls keep your house very clean. Where is Sanjay? You have reached the voicemail of Valentine and Sanjay. Please leave us a message. Sanju, I'm hungry. I'm waiting for you. I called you at the office too but it was diverted to the answering machine. Can you call me, please? Anu, where are you going? I'll be back soon. You guys carry on. - Hi. - Hi. Sorry. We laughed about it just yesterday. I didn't think you'd feel bad about it. Sorry. It's okay. I have to tell you something. Remember I told you Giri asked me out for coffee? I said no. - Why? - Simply. Because of our fight? You, silly. What does this has to do with the date? I don't want to go. But why? I just decided I don't want to. But you wanted to! Now, I think it is unnecessary. If you find him promising, I think you should go. Kafifi. This seems more promising to me. This is to inform the general public that Sanjay Peesapaati and An up am a Kasturi are best friends! If we both are best friends... then why should we stay in separate apartments? Why shouldn't we stay in the same apartment? We have a lot of relatives in the UK. What if our parents come to know? Wouldn't that be a problem? Come. Are you angry? Let's go. Tell me you are not angry. Come. Wait, let me pick these up. It looks like a magazine cover photo. Give a nice headline. There is nothing between me and Anu. We are just friends. I don't believe in dieting. This figure is God-given. I will pursue my acting even after marriage. I'm ready to show skin if the character demands. Yes. Me and Sanjay are in a live-in relationship. Yes! Me and Sanjay are in a live-in relationship. Me and Sanjay are in a live-in relationship. Yes. Good morning! Good morning! When did you wake up? 10 minutes ago. What plans? To be with you. I have to book tickets to go to India for my sister's marriage next month. Will you come? I love you. I love you. (Sanskrit hymn) [marriage chants] My brother's son lives in California. He left India long ago, in 1985 itself. My uncle's grandson lives in Texas. He married an American and settled there. He never came back to India. My eldest brother's grandson, Satthi's son, recently shifted to the US. To San Jose. Sorry, sorry. It's San Jose. We write it as S-A-N-J-O-S-E but in that J is silent. It is pronounced as 'San-hous-sey' How do we pronounce B-A-J-A? 'Baa-ja'? They call it 'Ba-ha'. Completely different in California. You know, Nevada? It's a desert. But just within a two hours drive, you'd find snowfall. California in the south has earthquakes. In California... Everything is silent except you. Yes. There was a person named Henry Kissinger. Because of him, India drifted towards Russia. Sanju! Can you come up once? I'll be back, uncle. Yeah. Yeah. Please carry on. Dear... I'm thinking of arranging an alliance between An up am a and Sunil. What do you think? I missed you. I missed you too. Hi, An up am a. - Are you fine? - Fine uncle. Are you done with school yet? I still have a year. Do you remember my son? You must have forgotten. Sunil. Come here. You wouldn't even let the doctor use the needle on you Unless Sunil was pricked first. Remember? Sunil. She's An up am a. Talk to her. - Hi. - Hi. Talk to her. Go. What should I talk about? Son, just a moment. - Go. Go. - Dad... Hi. Hi, Sunil. Friends. How are they? They are childhood friends. Talk to her. Hey, Sanjay. When did you come? Are you discussing London matters? No. I'm being taught about American history by him. Did he start already? He just gave me a brief introduction to Mexican influence in California. Just a wee bit. Anu, go to Aunt Rukmini's house and pick up a saree for me - Now? - Yes. Now. Catch an auto. It's already late, come back before lunch. No need. My son can do the pick up and drop service. No, thanks. I don't need any pick up and drop service My son is a good driver. Hey, go and drop her off. Come, Anu. Give, I'll serve. Dear, when can we have your wedding feast. My wife and I were planning to come to your house in a couple of days. What do you say? Someone is starving over there. Go and serve him. Okay, son. Sunil. I have to talk to you. Can you come up to the terrace? Shit, I'm so embarrassed. It's all my father's fault. I'm really sorry, Anu. Don't be. I'll be awkward every time I see you. There's nothing to feel awkward about. In fact, I'm glad I got to meet you after these many years. Yes, she told me about it. What did she say? That she's glad to meet you after all these years. Shall we leave? You leave. We'll stay for some more time. Actually, our doctor has recommended that we stay longer under the sun. For Vitamin D. Oh! Vitamin D? Yeah. Vitamin D Okay. Thank God! I cleared it. I'm relieved too. What did she say? She's soaking in Vitamin D. Vitamin D? [marriage chants] "The time spent with you, the distance walked with you. I like all of them." "The discrete conversations we had. I love every bit of them." "Our arguments and adjustments, I like both of them." "I love those sleepless nights spent with each other." "Two bodies with two souls should unify as two bodies and one soul." "Our journey should be like the Godavari river flowing in the serenity of the moonlight." "The time spent with you, the distance walked with you. I like all of them." "The discrete conversations we had. I love every bit of them." "It is your magic that the dreams are diving into the depth of my eyes." "It is because of you that my heart is so light that it flies out of my body." "I shall hide myself inside you" "I'll shelter you within myself." "With you..." "You taught my lips to quiver and made them speechless." "You taught my heart to sprint, now it only follows you." "Let's unite such that nobody can differentiate you from me and me from you." "The time spent with you, the distance walked with you. I like all of them." "The discrete conversations we had. I love every bit of them." Anu? Anu? What happened? Nothing. No, something happened. Tell me, what happened? Can we talk at home? Okay. I found a lump. What? I didn't get you. Two days ago, while in the shower I felt something odd. But I ignored it. Now after the swim, while showering... while showering...? I found a lump. What do you mean by lump? A lump in my breast. I'm scared, Sanjay. Hope I'm alright? Thank you. Did you notice the seventh item in the main course? That's your favourite. My taste has changed. Hey, I bought a house. Just 10 mins away from here. Why don't you visit once? Well, we can go after you finish your meeting. Seriously? An up am a? - Yeah. - Sorry, I'm late. You know what, this place serves the best Indian food. Why don't you talk about something? I'm trying to but I'm not sure what to talk about. I know. This is very awkward. I didn't expect them to arrange a lunch date for us. Why did you lie to me? I don't know about it. I really don't know. Don't try your petty games with me. I don't like it. Come and pick me up. Pick you up? Okay. Now that you are already there, just spend another two hours. We'll be there. What should I do here for another two hours? Please... this dinner is very important for your brother-in-law. I'm not going to stay here for more than 15 minutes. Anu... handle it carefully. Don't let this be an awkward thing for your brother-in-law. I hate that Suresh Malepati and his fake accent. He acts as if he is a Britisher by birth. He helped us a lot. Us? Aren't you leaving me? Sanjay, I'm graduating this fall and you are graduating the next fall. What should I do for one whole year? So you're not obliged to inform me about your application, is that so? I do it every day. I have applied to 32 companies so far. Sanjay, I've got an interview opportunity at Clarks on scientific. Are you happy for me? Happy for you? I'm very happy for you. But, I'm not happy for us. Just one year, Sanjay. Can't we manage a long-distance relationship? You can come to visit me on the weekends. We'd have a decent apartment. I should visit you? You don't want me to graduate? My thesis proposal also hasn't been approved yet. Okay, I'll visit you. It's not about who visits whom. I feel hurt that you are hiding things from me, Anu. What did I hide? I just found out about it... Anyways, all the best for your interview. [song humming] I'll get back to you on that. Thank you. Bye. Sanjay! Sanjay! - Hi, Pooja. - Hi. Oye, you want to have a coffee? No. I'm good. Are you coming to India Night on Saturday? I don't know. I'll be busy. Come on, man. It'll be fun. What are you working on? Thesis proposal. Hey! - Don't disturb... Please. - Okay. Are you coming or not? Are you coming or not? I'll come. Good! Do you know how much debt I had by the time I graduated? All the credit cards had maxed out. I cleared everything in the first two years itself. There is no fun in a student's life. The real fun starts after you receive your first salary. I bought a BMW X3 for 32 thousand pounds. 32 thousand pounds, bro. Revving it up on M25 feels like... Woah... You have to speed up your Masters program me. I'll be submitting my thesis proposal this semester. I'll have the defence by next spring. Isn't it too late? I came here in the fall. I achieved 180 credits in 3 semesters. Also, I didn't let that affect my grades. I scored a 3.75 GPA. Is everything fine between you and Sanjay? Yeah! Marriage can complicate things. If you are not sure, you should... Sister, please... Sister, What I ever told you, I told you in pain. Please forget all that. You know I love you, right? You can call me anytime you feel like talking to me. Okay? Thank you. Do you have a lighter? I don't smoke. He has many credit cards and cleared all his debt, so what? Who cares if he owns a BMW and how it revs up? Moreover, he put a lighter in his pocket and asked me for a lighter. Can we not talk about that, please? So, Valentine... Where's your girlfriend? We broke up. Yeah. I'm good. She sang well, no? - I didn't expect that. - Sanju... Dude wants a beer. We are going to Gillies. Would you care to join? You promised, bro. You carry on. We'd leave for home. Okay bye. Guys, I can give you a ride. Let me play some music, guys. This CD has only this song. Do you like that song that much? Yeah, I love that song. You just need one song for your entire life. That's enough. What a romantic song! Nice meeting you. Thank you. Bye. - Bye. - Bye. Bye. Hi, Anu! We reached the International Students centre. Where are you guys? Have you started or not? We are waiting for you. Hi, Anu. This is Suresh Malepati. I have some good news for you. Remember I said I had sent your resume to Mark? He might call you for an interview. Are you ready for an interview? Hi, Suresh. How are you? So, I'm ready for the interview. No, no, I wasn't busy. We had been to India Night. Health? Fine. I'm fine now. Why aren't you attending the party? Is it because its Anupama's farewell? Oye, is everything okay? Yeah. Three men are in the prison and they are going to die by the execution of the chair. God says to them, you are allowed to pick one meal, just one meal, before you die. The Italian man says, "Oh, for my last meal, I'll have a pizza". The French man says, "I'll have a croissant". And the Indian man says, "I'll have some strawberries". God says we can't find any strawberries, they are out of season. The Indian man said, "Okay, I'll wait". You are finished? Will you come home? Actually, I cooked for two people today. We'll have dinner together. Dinner? I'm not hungry. Hey, what? Please. Okay. Leave me alone for 10 mins, I'm writing my Thesis proposal. Okay. By the way, my house is all messy. Come to my flat after 20 mins of me leaving. When will you come? After 20 mins. Good. Actually, come after 30 mins. Okay. - Don't be late. - Okay. Okay, see you. - Thank you. - You are welcome. Anu, where is Sanjay? He should be here shortly. Oh! It's very, very, very hot guys. Do you want a beer? Yeah. It's very hot. Let me get you one from the refrigerator. Thank you. Hi! Hello... Come. Yeah! Here you go. Nice song! Until yesterday, I just liked this song. But today onwards, I'm in love with this song. Is your girlfriend jealous-type? Why do you ask? Simply. Actually... If boyfriend is handsome, it is obvious that she would be insecure. She is not jealous at all. Yeah! Cheers! We'll really miss you. Thank you so much for coming. Thank you. You seem to be too busy, dude. Thesis, man. Sanju, where were you? I called you so many times. I was in the department. Shall I warm your dinner? Sanjay bye... We miss you, An up am a. - Miss you too. - See you soon. I'll be in touch with you by phone. But I'll miss your food. Miss you too. See you guys. Bye. Bye. Come Garry - Bye. - Bye. (Humming a song) Anu! Anu, are you okay? Yeah. I'm good. I'm good. - See you. - See you. I'm gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you too. See you. Bye. Good luck, Anu. Thank you so much. Sanju, where were you? In the department. You were aware of today's party, weren't you? The deadline is approaching. Have you finished your work? Not yet. Where did you listen to that song? Where did you listen to that song? Which song? Don't pretend. Am I not allowed to visit my friends? Friend? I noticed how she looks at you. I'm not an idiot. I just went for a casual meet. Why do you overreact? Casual meet? You didn't attend my send-off party and went to see some other girl... You are throwing a party for leaving. I didn't feel like attending it.. So what? This is how everything starts. This is how we gradually grow apart. First, you'll say it's a long-distance relationship, you'll meet me once a month. Then you will get busy and will have new friends... You are leaving me. Why did you lie? Why did you lie? Why did you lie to me? I don't understand, why am I being interrogated? Yes, I lied to you. Just like you applied for 30 companies, I too have 30 friends. You feel very distant, Sanjay. I'm preparing for a long-distance relationship. Do you even love me? You are leaving me and you are questioning me? Do you even love me? Answer my question. How many times should I answer? I don't feel it. You didn't support me when I got a job. You don't like my family. You don't spend time with me. What are you doing when I was in the hospital, Sanjay? I don't even know you anymore. I love you. If things change, I'll let you know Okay? Say that while looking into my eyes. What kind of demand is this? Answer my question while looking into my eyes. Tell me. I have to tell you something. I didn't know this was a date. I hope you are not disappointed. Now you know that. I hope you are not disappointed. I don't like this. What don't you like? Love, Marriage, I don't want all this. Then why did you come here in the first place? Maybe I'm an idiot. Sanjay. Do you still want to show me your house? Usually, there is no traffic on this road. The roads get busy only after crossing Runnymede. My dad visited me last Christmas. Do you know what he commented about my house? He said why did you buy an old house for such a hefty price? I found a lump. I'm scared, Sanjay. Will I be alright? Are you scared? A little. They ask you to count to 10 after injecting you with Anaesthesia. You will barely be able to count to 5 and by the time you regain consciousness, the surgery would have been done. Don't be afraid. Everything will go well. Where is Sanjay? He is at the insurance claims. He said he might get late. Hey, may I use your phone? Go ahead. Thank you. You have reached the voicemail of Valentine and Sanjay. Please leave us a message. Sanjay, where are you? She was just taken into the surgery ward. She waited for you for a long time. The surgery would be completed in 3 hours. Come here before that, we all are here. Anu! Anu! Doctor said everything will be ok. Impressive. 17th century. Do you remember this microwave oven? We bought it for 30 pounds. I paid 15 and Valentine paid the other 15. While moving out, he took the vacuum cleaner and I got the oven. I didn't hold onto anything from my past, I threw away everything. I kept it as a memory. Nice. What memories do you have? I have a microwave. Very sentimental! He doesn't mean anything to me. What do you mean why did I meet him? I need closure. Listen to me, Anu... You have always asked me to move on, right? I have some questions to ask. I can't move on without finding the answers to them. I'll send you the location details. Come and pick me up. Anu, we are waiting for your answer. My answer is no. Why? I don't want to meet anyone. He's my client's cousin. He did his Masters in the same field as yours. He wants to meet you. Just meet him and talk casually. This is a crazy plan. How long will this go on, Anu? 'You fall in love only once in your life' is not true Don't fall into that trap. Thank you. What did you pray for? That you should behave well. Am I not behaving well? Dad handed over your responsibility to me. What happened now? What wrong did I do? Do you know how many people are craving to have a life like yours? Look at other students, they are working part-time at grocery stores or petrol to pay their fees and study. You got admission in a good university. Your brother is paying fees for you. Yet you are discontinuing your Masters? I don't understand it. Hello, Mr. Bhaskar Rao, I'm not discontinuing my Masters. I just deferred it. I still have six years to complete my Masters. That's what I don't understand. Why don't you finish it in one go? It's very hard to get back this momentum. Listen, I know what I'm doing with my life. Learn to respect my choices. How can I respect them when all of them are stupid choices? What are you talking about? Tell me. What are you talking about? Do you know where I can find asafoetida? I don't know. - Hi. - Hi. This is my cousin, Anvesh. He stays in Manchester. - Hi, Anvesh. - Hi, An up am a. In the university, we were... Oh, okay We planned to chill at home this evening. That's why I thought... Do we have beer? Yeah! Yeah! Where are you working? Design Engineer at Clarks on Scientific. And you? Imagination technology, semiconductors. I'm in between jobs. I'm not looking for any job right now. I'm in no hurry. Alright. I'm an active member of the Telugu Association of London. You must definitely attend the next event. Okay. I'll take your number from him. I don't have her number. What? You both are from the same university but don't have each other's number? How? I mean I don't have her latest number. Can we exchange numbers? Sure. I can give you my number if you... I'll type it in. Call that number once, just to be sure... - Thank you. - You're welcome. Anu! Sorry, it was a little awkward. It's okay. Can I call you or is it... - Sure. - Thanks. What did you want? Beer? - Cheers! - Cheers! No. No. No. There you go. It was great fun. Hey Sanjay, we are going to Billie's to play some poker. You wanna come? No, Sanjay. Please. I'll be back in an hour... please Once in a while is fine but this shouldn't be the only source of your entertainment, right? Come on. Please. Just one hour. Please. Okay. Call me after you reach home. Sanjay, I love you. Take care. Fantastic. Let's go. Let's go. Bye. Julia? Oh, you're back? Was she a good girl? She was a darling. Oh, good girl. You, mumma's baby! Yes, you are. Yes, you are. Yeah. Call me tomorrow. Why don't you stay for dinner? Oh, no. My sister's waiting for me. You need to get a place of your own. And get yourself a boyfriend. I'll ask dad to take you back to India. Brother, love is sacrifice. You know that? I'm sure I can change Sanjay. I will. You're a fool. He is a torn currency note that you'd exchange in the bank. Everyone goes through a phase like that. Pooja, he doesn't love you. Don't waste your time on false hopes. Think about it. Hey, our coffee date... I'm very sorry. It's embarrassing to think about it. Oh, God. It was so much trouble. I reserved a table. Later I asked him to cancel but he refused to do so. He threatened to sue me in court. Then I offered him a solution. I told him, you have another coffee shop in Brighton where I and An up am a would come and have coffee after two years. Then he cancelled Smooth. Why didn't you go there with your cousin? I tried but the reservation read An up am a and he's adamant that only An up am a should accompany me. Oh! So we have to go to Brighton and have coffee. Are we leaving now? Are we leaving now? Hi, dude. Hi, dude. Long time. Did you gain weight? Stop it. My head is going to blast with anxiety. What happened? Are you planning to keep my standing? Can we have a seat and discuss my issue? Move... Let's go. These elders... It's difficult to deal with them. All they do is blackmail us. I can't say no to anything they ask or else they blackmail me of suicide. What happened? They say they'll kill themselves if I marry a girl of my choice. So they want me to kill myself by marrying me to a girl of their choice. Is this your new girlfriend? You didn't inform me. I came here to tell you about her. The last time I visited India, I wanted to hold her father's collar and reprimand him for being so narrow-minded. I couldn't do it because Keerti would feel bad. Why would Keerti feel bad? I didn't understand. That means, you and Keerti... Yes. Stop kidding me. Why would I joke about this matter? Why didn't you tell me all this while? Even Keerti never mentioned anything about this. Her family started to look for an alliance. She called me and said she can't adjust in an arranged marriage. From then onwards... So when are you getting married? I don't know. It's their wish. I have no part in it. I was given the opportunity to choose the bride. By the way, I forgot to tell you something. I called An up am a and she was with somebody Who? Giri. Why are you feeling sad? I'm not feeling bad. It's her life, her choice. How's Pooja? Yeah! Sanjay... I love you. Thank you. I'm saying I love you and come back with a thank you? Why can't you say you love me? Sanjay? This is too much pressure. Just a little while. If you let me be. Every time you ask me to spell it out for you, I feel like I'm being forced to repeat it. Try to understand. Sanjay, I want commitment. How can I give it to you? Do I carry it in my pocket? It's how we feel about each other. But I know how I feel about you. And I love you. Sanjay, I love you. I really love you, Sanjay. Why can't you say you love me? Is saying it out loud enough? Don't I have to feel it in here? Anu... Coffee. Are you in touch with Keerti and Valentine Rao? Sometimes. And you? Sometimes. Hey, do you remember Keerti's birthday in Paddleton Apartment? Yeah! I have a video of that event. Wanna watch that? Hello. We have Keerti, An up am a and Valentine with us today. Happy birthday. Happy birthday. Happy birthday to you... Happy birthday to you... Happy birthday to Keerti. Happy birthday to you. Anu, do you want some? It's not my birthday, it's Keerti's. I don't want it. No. Don't. Whose hair is this? No. No. No. - Anu come... - No.. No.. Please Did you ever imagine they'd get married? Vali, An up am a is not coming. Why? I told her that Sanjay will be coming. Since then she kept saying she's undecided and now finally she said she won't come. Hey! An up am a is coming. Vali, will there be any problem? I have a master plan for this, you don't worry. Welcome, buddy. Hello! Are you in disguise? What's with that beard? I would have directly come to the hotel, why did you call me here? Chill, my boy. I need a favour. Sure... You know my cousin Neelima? You have to bring her along with you to the marriage destination. Why? I expected you to arrive a week before the marriage and help with all the arrangements. You didn't do any of that, at least do this one favour. I feel very awkward with strangers. Please, dude. Okay. Where is she? Ms. Neelima? - Valentine's cousin? - Sanjay! Come, sit here Valentine told me about you. Why are you depressed? Depression? He asked me to not leave alone even for a minute. All along the marriage? Yeah. Look at me, I'm always happy no matter how many hardships I have faced in my life. It's okay. Hi! I'm Neelima Ratnababu. Hi, I'm Sanjay. Is Ratnababu your father's name? No. It's that scoundrel's. Which scoundrel? The one they got me married to. Ms. Neelima, if you don't mind, I'd like to tell you something. I don't think it's a good idea that we both accompany each other. My cab is waiting outside, I shall... Wait... Let me tell you about Ratnababu. We gave 60 lakhs dowry to him. My father arranged it with a lot of difficulties. Those days, my father was facing a loss in business. I was their only daughter. To avoid humiliation, he sold off the plantation. Humiliation - Plantation, did you like the rhyming? He sold it off for 5 or 6 lakhs, now its value is more than 1 crore. Why do I need to know all this? You are obliged to know my marital status. Listen, I couldn't say no to Valentine. But I can't accompany you. Relax. I'm divorced, okay? Congratulations. I'll get the official papers in three months. So you are not divorced yet? I'm divorced. Are you crazy? Don't you get it? You said you didn't get the papers. You see, the properties are attached to both of us, so... Ms. Neelima, I don't think it's right on our behalf to accompany each other. Mister, stop overacting! I promised Valentine. - Is it unavoidable? - Come on. How may I help you, sir? I have a reservation. May I see your ID, please? I have a friend named An up am a. Can you tell me her room number? An up am a... How do you spell her last name, sir? K-A-S-T-U-R-I Ok, got it sir. An up am a Kasturi and Giriraj Kamarsu. They are in room number 1327, sir. Mister, let's go. How long will it take? - Thank you. - My pleasure. Coming. Sanjay, don't call her. Don't ever call her, okay? If you see her, don't even talk to her. If she initiates the conversation... Sanjay, come fast. Usually, BF's wait for their GF's. Here everything is happening in reverse. Ms. Neelima, we are not BF and GF. What kind of attire is that? This is so out of fashion. What kind of attire is that? I told you to wear the mustard green colour shirt, but you didn't listen to me. Ms. Neelima, please. Ok, come. Come. Come. - Hello. - Hi. Hello! Are you here to attend the marriage? Yeah! Where are your manners? Introduce yourself. Hi. I'm Sanjay. Giri. Where are you from? London Are you Chowdhari's? Ms. Neelima, do we need to know that? Come. One minute. I just asked them whether they are Chowdhari's. Why did you scream at me? Sorry. Ratnababu used to do the same thing, he would shout at me in public. Hi Anu... How are you? - HI! - How was your Flight? It was good. Oh my god! - How are you? - I'm good. Did you really think, I won't come? I did. I didn't. Hey, Sanju. Neelima... Hey, Vali! How are you? Are you really getting married? Didn't you get married as well? Shouldn't I? - Okay. Stop it. - Sanjay! Hey, Keerti... Congratulations. Thank you. Thank you. How was your flight? All good. - HI! - Come, let's go. Come. Sanjay, come. Sanjay, come fast. What? Come here. Shall we go there? There's an empty table over there. Okay. As you all know, Valentine has had his fair share of girlfriends. I'm an attractive guy, you see. I know, I'm not his first love. But I'm not upset about it. Because when we were discussing our marriage, he said one thing, He said... you might not be my first love but you are certainly my last love. I felt the honesty in his words. It's more blissful to be somebody's last love than to be their first love, isn't it? What a lovely couple! But I don't like the fact that the marriage event is only for a day. Destination weddings should take place for a week, at least. Hello, my beloved guests, we are not sponsoring your holiday. We are getting married! It's okay, bro. Anupama's and Giri's marriage event will happen for 5 days. Sanjay, come here. Shall I tell you a secret? Do you remember Anu and Giri? The couple that we met in the lift. That boy is not her first boyfriend. She already had a relationship. They were in a live-in relationship. But he wasn't a good person. He was a womaniser. He used to beat her as well. - Beat her? - Yes. They didn't say that specifically but I know about such men. They say Giri is a good person. I also felt the same way. Maybe her ex-boyfriend was also a good person. Don't take his side. Do you know how ill-treated I felt with Ratnababu? But still, I used to adjust. Ms. Neelima... Ms. Neelima... Ms. Neelima... Shall we leave? We are getting late for the marriage. It's just right beside the suitcase. Okay, I'll get it. Key card? Ms. Neelima... I'll be back. Where? I'll be back here. I'm asking you where you are going. That's why I didn't want to accompany you. Okay. Okay. Sorry. Go.. I had to use the washroom. I didn't know this was your room. The door was open, so I came in. Okay, bye. It's okay. You can use the washroom. Are you sure? I'll manage. No, no. It's okay. Go ahead. What are you searching for? Are you done? Shall we leave? Can I have a cup of coffee? I'm drowsy due to jet lag. Help yourself. Everyone was saying that Giri was your boyfriend since your university days. Why didn't you correct them? Are you done? Give me a minute. It's hot. I heard you refused to attend the marriage because I was coming. No, I didn't say so. Do you think about me? Aren't you not done with your coffee? Are you happy with Giri? Every relationship requires a strong foundation. You have that with me. If our foundation was so strong, why did our relationship fail? If I could get one more chance. How can you be so selfish, Sanjay? I'm with somebody now. You enter my room and... How can you talk to me like this? Actually... Shall we leave? Are you marrying him? What makes you think you can ask me these questions? Okay. Your life, your wish. Let's go. I'm just talking to you. Do you have a problem talking to me? Once upon a time, I was your best friend. Once upon a time, I spoke a lot with you. Now I don't have anything to talk to you. Just get out, man. "The clouds around my eyes... will you please stop?" "There is no point in negotiating with the shadow that will not return" "The memories that incite grief in your heart..." "Don't think about it, let it not make you agitated." "The clouds around my eyes... will you please stop?" I love you! Good girl! You tell me... See you tomorrow. "No matter how close I'm to you, there will be still distance between us," "I realised this the moment I encountered you." "Only my aching heart knows the pain of the separation" "Only the feet which once walked along with you know what parting away means." "The clouds around my eyes... will you please stop?" "The path where you are not present leads to a deadlock." "The time stops to find your whereabouts." "Oh, rainbow, the one that emerges from a downpour..." "Will you lead me to my co-passenger of life?" "The clouds around my eyes... will you please stop?" "There is no point in negotiating with the shadow that will not return" It seems Sanjay misses you a lot. I can't help it. Did you miss Sanjay after coming here, even for a moment? Giri, please. I'm not asking this to inquire about your relationship with him, I'm asking this to have clarity on our relationship. Did you miss Sanjay? No! Sanjay... do you know Anupama's ex-boyfriend? I know him. What is he doing now? He must be crying somewhere in the corner. Poor guy, he must have also hurt his hand, Right? Do you know what I found out in these two days? When it is not working out... What do they say... Move on or move out. We must do that. Anu... An up am a Kasturi, will you marry me? This is my first car. EMI is 600 pounds. I shall always be indebted to Ms. An up am a Kasturi who financially helped me with 200 pounds. Why did you help me financially? Is it just friendship or something more than that? I was getting a car and a driver for just 200 pounds. I thought it was a great deal. Is it recording? Should I press the red button? Yes, it is recording. Come on. Is it really recording? Action? Action! Why are you blushing? I'm not. It happens to me. You said it was your life's dream. And that it was your ultimate goal... Did I say so? You forced me to submit my name. Don't you have any respect for your senior? Come on... Action! Come on. Not this skit. Please... Cut it. Cut it. Please -No, no. Come on. Come on. Let's do something else. Please... What shall we do? The first presentation in the Janaranjani program me is a skit written by An up am a and Sanjay filled with fun... and entertainment. A short play. Requested by Malik, Sai, and Nitin from Jalaripet, and Srinivas and Sagar from Chavulamadum. He is lying. Nobody requested it. We were eager to perform it but we were not allowed because... [singing song] Shall I ask you something? What? Never mind. I'll come in a minute. Bad idea. Should we greet him? We should. Hi. Sanju, pick up the phone. We had to go to groceries right. Keerti is not coming. I'm ready. Come, pick me up. Sanju, I'm hungry. I'm waiting for you. I called you at the office but it's being diverted to the answering machine. Call me, please. Hello, I'll be back home in 15 mins. It feels as if we are married, isn't it? I love you. Okay. Delete it after listening to it. It'll be awkward if somebody else hears it. Okay? Bye. Sanjay, where are you? They just took her to the surgery ward. She waited for you for a long time. The surgery will be done in another three hours. Come fast. We are here with her. Sanju, where are you? I'm scared. I want to see you. Please come to the hospital. Anu! Where is my phone? Which phone? Where is your bag? No. Sanjay! Sanjay... Sanjay, leave it. Sanjay... Anu, give it back. Hey, why are you harassing her? Sanjay... I told you. I told you to not visit him. Sanjay! Those are my memories. I have equal rights on them. I don't want you to have them. Apart from these memories, I don't have anything else in my life that makes me happy. All this is fake. Everything is a lie. Yes, I made a mistake. But what happened between us is not a lie. I don't agree with that. I love you. I always did. Yeah? Sanjay, why weren't you with me when I was in the hospital, when I needed you the most? Tell me. Tell me. Come, Sanjay. Come, Sanjay. Anu... Anu... I was scared, Anu. When I saw you at the hospital, it reminded me of my mother. I didn't expect it. Mom was always beside me during my illness and happiness. But all of a sudden, my world turned upside down. I never expected that. She promised that she'll come back. She kept saying that she's fine. And then she was gone. Again it happened to you. I was scared of losing you. For the second time... For the second time in my life, I was shit scared. I didn't understand what to do. I didn't know whether you'll come back or not. I just didn't understand what to do, Anu. When you needed me the most I was not there beside you. Then how can I say I love you to you? How can I muster enough courage to look into your eyes? I couldn't face you. I thought of leaving you before you left me. Sorry, Anu. I'm sorry. You've always said that love is not a feeling, love is an ability. I learnt it. No, I'm learning it. You saw something in me and said this is promising. Look at me from the same perspective for one more time. I won't ever let you down. I promise. "This is the first-ever celebration for the heart." "This is the podium of dreams that eyes were awaiting." "Now that we have realised each other to be soul mates..." "Death won't part us apart." "The story that started with the conflict between a spark and a droplet is going to be endless." "The world is painted with joy and the path is filled with blooming flowers." "Silence is talking to its counterpart while swinging in the clouds." "The world is painted with joy. The air has sprinkled incense all over." "The once distance has now become a thread that has tied us together." "The world is painted with joy. "The insurmountable delight has caused me to get lost in bewilderment." "The universe witnesses this!"
