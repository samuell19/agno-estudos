I found this man laying, with his head roughly the center of the bed, his body coming back like this. His two hands were laying over the... the bed like this, and just off, or right below his, uh, right hand, was a .45 automatic. Just a short way away from his left hand was a shotgun. I didn't know if he was... uh, how bad he was injured, so I picked up... I grabbed him by the left wrist, and I pulled him out into... or onto the door, which had been used as a barricade. I then backed off again. [ Speaks indistinctly ] - I'm the Deputy Chairman - Of the state of Illinois Black Panther Party, Fred Hampton. - I have the pledge tonight - To introduce - who I believe is - One of the baddest motherfuckers in the world... [ Crowd cheers ] a man that did something that a lot of us oughta be very glad that he did. He was a part of making the only party which exists in the United States today that represents the people. [ Crowd cheers ] As a matter of fact, he was one-half. - Him and Huey P. Newton started - Out in 1966. Sometimes I think where some of us were in 1966. - I think what we would've said - If we'd heard - about some niggers - Going out in the street, - talking about sheriffs and guns, - Fighting all them policemen, - because we didn't know - They was pigs, out there in the streets. - -Right on. - -Right on. - Hampton: And I think I'm - Speaking for the whole party of the state of Illinois... I know I am... [ Crowd cheers ] - ...when I say that we love - Huey P. Newton. - -Right on! - -Right on! - -We love Eldridge Cleaver. - -Right on! We love Bobby Hutton. Right on! We love the Black Panther Party. - -Right on! - -Right on! - And we love - Chairman Bobby Seale. - -Right on! - -Right on! - We love them - Because they was the first ones to took a stand against capitalism and racism - and said that we are fighting - Till the end. - We said, "We'll join the line - Somewhere, motherfucker, - if you try to pass us, - We'll blow your brains out." - -Right on! - -Right on! - They was the first ones that - Came through with the program - that was initiated for the, uh, - For the benefit of the people. - All those things that I named - And reasons why we love them are reasons that make it beneficial to us. But let me simply say when I'm introducing Brother Bobby that we love him because he loves the love. Chairman Bobby Seale. [ Cheers and applause ] Seale: Right on! Right on. Alright. We here for some jive conspiracy. You know what we gonna do? We are going to defend ourselves. Because Huey P. Newton said, that power... power is the ability to define phenomena and make it act in a desired manner. Power is the ability to define phenomena - and make it act - In a desired manner. What kind of phenomena? Social phenomena. What is the social phenomena? - Black people, Mexican American, - Any kind of people, begin to learn that the social phenomena is that, in fact, - U.S. racist, decadent, - Capitalist, imperialistic America is a phony state. That a phony state exists here, - that these pigs - Are doing nothing - but protecting - The avaricious businessman and the demagogic politician, protecting the exploitative system that they got going. That, in fact, we are tired of it, we are sick of it. - You've been brutalizing - The Black people. - You been murdering - And lynching them. Black people are tired of it. - Black people are the vanguard of - The revolution all of a sudden, and if phenomena correct also, but we are concerned with that social phenomena. - We are concerned - With that exploitation. We are concerned with the oppression that Black people - and all other peoples - In the world, - who are suffering the same - Common oppression that we are suffering today. The thing is that we have the ability to define it. So if we have the ability to define it, the only next thing to do is get organized. Get organized. So when a pig walks up to you, or a pig get too jive with the people, - you'll be so organized, - You'll be learning some tactics, - you'll be learning - Some revolutionary principles, - you'll be having some guns - Hid out somewhere, you'll have some proper tactics. That when the pig get to jiving with you, the pig is wrong. - You whip your guns out on him, - Blow him away, and then you have the ability, in fact you have made that pig act in a desired manner. [ Cheers and applause ] Seale: But for what? But for what? - For a new system, brothers. - We need a new system. The people need a new system. I sat yesterday afternoon next to Bobby Seale, while he said that a federal marshal tried to ram a 4-inch piece of cloth gauze into his mouth. Three marshals held his head, one marshal held his nose so that he couldn't breathe, and a fifth marshal attempted to press against his mouth, with all his weight, this gauze that ultimately resulted in Bobby bleeding profusely around the mouth and the lips as they tried to jam this piece of object into his mouth to silence him. I'm so thirsty for revolution. I'm so crazy about the people. We're gonna stand together. We're gonna have a Black army, a Mexican American army, and a line to solidarity. - We're gonna have some - Progressive whites. All of us. - And we're gonna march - On this big power structure, - and we're gonna say, - "Stick 'em up, motherfucker. We come for what's ours." Up against the wall! Power to the people. Thanks, brothers. [ Cheers and applause ] [ Man speaking indistinctly ] [ Cheers and applause [ continue ] - When they got together, - Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale, - yes, - They got together with guns, - and there's nothing - Wrong with that. Because we need some guns. Black people need some peace. White people need some peace. - And we are gonna have - To fight, we are gonna have to struggle, - we're gonna have to - Struggle relentlessly to bring about some peace, - because the people - That we are asking for peace, - they are a bunch - Of megalomaniac war-mongers, - and they don't even - Understand what peace means. - And we've got to fight 'em. - We've got to struggle with them - to make 'em understand - What peace means. [ Applause ] - Bobby Seale is going - Through all types of physical and mental torture. But that's all right, because we said, even before this happened, - and we gonna say it after this - And after I'm locked up, and after everybody's locked up, that you can jail the revolutionary, - but you can't jail - The revolution. [ Applause ] Right. - You might run a liberator - Like Eldridge Cleaver out the country, but you can't run liberation out the country. You might murder a freedom fighter like Bobby Hutton, - but you can't - Murder freedom fightin', - and if you do, - You'll come up with answers that don't answer, information that don't explain. - You come up with conclusions - That don't conclude. And you have come up with people - that you thought should - Be acting like pigs, - is acting like people, - And moving on pigs, - and that's what - We've got to do. So we gonna see about Bobby, - regardless of what these people - Think we should do. - Because schools - Is not important and work is not important. - Nothing is more important - Than stopping fascism, - because fascism - Will stop us all. We gonna see about Bobby, because Bobby came and saw about us. When I saw he had 16 pieces of adhesive tape strapped across his mouth, when I saw the gauze around his head, when I saw that his ankles were strapped in leg irons to his chair and his hands handcuffed to his side, I knew that we would unite in this country to stop this outrageous, criminal, Nixon stampede over elementary human rights. We will free Bobby Seale, and we will stop this trial. A lot of people don't understand the Black Panther Party's relationship - with White, - Mother country radicals. - A lot of people don't even - Understand that word that Eldridge uses a lot. - What we're saying is that - There are White people in the mother country that are for the same types of things that we are for... - stimulating revolution - In the mother country. - And we said that we would work - With anybody, form coalitions with anybody, that has revolution on their mind. We're not a racist organization because we understand that racism is an excuse used for capitalism, and we know that racism is a by-product of capitalism. Everything would be alright - if everything was put back - In the hands of the people, - and we're gonna have to put it - Back in the hands of the people. Everybody in the state of Illinois is gonna have to be involved, or even around, the revolution, 'cause we gonna have one. We gonna have to do more than talk. - We gonna have to do more - Than listen. - We gonna even have to do - More than learn. - We gonna have to start - Practicing, and that's very hard. - We got to start getting out - There with the people, - and a lot of times, we think - We're better than the people. - But that's an insult, - And that's criminal. - It's gonna take - A lot of hard work. - Come on in, little brother. - Come on in, little sister. - Y'all can sit down - And get something to eat. - [ Child speaks - Indistinctly ] Y'all take off y'all's coat. We need some more cups out here. Sit down, man! - Y'all can eat as much - As y'all want to. Right on. [ Indistinct conversations ] Who wants seconds? You want cereal? Who all wants cereal? One, two... Who wants cinnamon? Raise their hand. Who... Anybody want some milk? Alright. [ Indistinct conversations ] [ Speaks indistinctly ] Well, take it. That's good for your teeth, man. It makes your teeth strong. Who else didn't... Who left this milk over here? [ Indistinct conversations ] - That's what the Breakfast - For Children program is. - A lot of people think - It's charity, but what... - It takes the people - On the stage to another stage and another stage. - And any program - That's revolutionary is an advanced program. - Revolution gets changed, - Unending, - just keep on changing, - That's what we do. - We take the people in there - And take them - through those changes, - And before you know it, - they are, in fact, not only - Knowing what socialism is... - They do not need to know what it - Is, they are endorsing it, - they are participating in it, - They are observing, and they are supporting socialism. Oh, you fitting to go to school now? Alright. Right on. All power to the people. That's the people's thing! Socialism is the people! You afraid of yourself. - If you afraid of socialism, - You afraid of yourself. - Basically, you knowing - My ideology, and basically, me knowing yours, you can, uh, support some of our programs, that what you're saying? Diaga: Why not? Breakfast for Children program, free health clinics? Brown brothers? - We believe - They're good things. Uh-huh. - As the focal point - To organize their mothers and fathers. Uh-huh. Peace. Mm-hmm. - There's no educational - Program in here? Uh, that's a social license thing. You set that up, brother. You can't put everything on one piece of paper. What about this bank? - -Credit union? - -Mm-hmm. Man: Credit union. - Credit union, my brother, - Is a bank. - Are you hip to credit unions? - It is a bank. - Yeah, you go - And borrow money? Yeah, that's a bank. It's a bank. Owned by the people. Run for the people. And by the people. Mm-hmm. - What would money be - Given out to people for? - Well, the people - Would decide that. Whatever. You know, the people in the community decide. You need some living room furniture maybe? You need a car, maybe? - See, - The thing is with me, - I need to know - Some more about... - I wish you had some more - Literature about - the educational - Thing here. Because, you dig, as far as we concerned, you struggling... - the way you look - At struggling is that, uh, - this depends on - The educational thing, you dig? - Because this depends - On the education. Well, the whole thing... - No, but ain't - Any of this does. - You... you could form this - With no education. - You could form this - And this. - Uh, no, not the way - We talk about forming it. You know, right, we talking about forming it right. - You know, it's not on paper. - We didn't write it on paper. - How you form it right - With no education? No. - Let me give you - An example. Jomo Kenyatta formed - an excellent revolution - With no education, - and all it did - In the end thing, - Jomo told them motherfuckers, - He said, "Well, uh, you know, you can educate, uh, hate in every blood. - I'm your brother. - I'm gonna help you - Lead the revolution, now I'm gonna oppress you." - Another example... - Papa Doc in Haiti. - Papa Doc in Haiti - Hated everything White. - Man, you couldn't put - This White paper - in front - Of Papa Doc's face, - but he moved - All the White people out - and he took over - To be oppressor, you dig? Because of no education. - And if people had been - Educated, they'd have said, - that, "We don't hate - The motherfucker White people, we hate the oppressor, - whether he be White, - Black, brown, or yellow." - So we got to know - The educational program - to find out what is - Gonna be in the finale. - Lot of people... - Jomo Kenyatta's called not a never-revolutionary but an ex-revolutionary. - So is Papa Doc. They brought on - Successful revolution. - That thing in the Mau-Maus - Was a bitch. - Bantu, freedom fighters, - All that kind of action. What we saying is, is the end. - But you don't - Judge Castro now. - You can't do it. - Nobody in this room can judge - whether Castro's gonna be - A revolutionary or not. You know what I mean. - We talking about things, - You know what I mean, - with, uh, China, - The People's Republic, - and even at the state - They in now, - talking about even - Going on further into a Communistic state. - That's what we talkin' about. - Those are revolutionary. - So we got - To understand here, - the educational program - That you have, to be able to figure out - whether it will go - On the right lines, - where the people will end up - In a situation, - where they can be able - To really control themselves. - You understand - What I'm saying? - Uh, with no education, - The people - that take the local foundations - Start stealing money, - because they won't be - Really educated - to why it's - The people's thing anyway. - You understand what I'm saying? - With no education, - you have neocolonialism - Instead of colonialism, like you got in... in Africa now, like you got in, uh, in, uh, Haiti. - So, what we talking about is, - It has to be, uh, - educational program, - That's very important. - As a matter of fact, - This is so important to us - that a person - Has to go through - six weeks of - Our political education - before he can consider - Himself a member of the party, able to even run out ideology for the party. - Why? Because if they don't - Have an education, - then they're nowhere. - You dig what I'm saying? - They're nowhere. - Because they don't even - know why they doing - What they doing. - You might get people - Caught up - in the emotionalist movement. - You understand me? - You might get caught - Being poor, and then want something. - And then, if they're not - Educated, they'll want more, - and before you know it, - They'll be capitalism, - and before you know it, - We'd have Negro imperialists. Yeah, but you see, brother, - the reason we don't do - A lot of talking - because what you say is - A foregone conclusion with us. Yeah, well, see, brother, - the reason I do - Do a lot of talking - is because I don't... - There's no foregone - conclusions with me. - Who are these programs - Geared towards? - You got Black Easter, - You got Black Christmas, you got Black Groundhog Day, you got Black April Fool's. - Ain't geared toward nobody - But Black businessmen. And I say that anybody that comes into our community - and sets up any type - Of situation that does not meet the needs of the masses, - then I, Chairman President - Of the Black Panther Party, say that I catch that nigger by his collar neck - and beat him to death - With a Black Panther paper. We not bullshitting. [ Cheers and applause ] Rush: In that area, - where you have - A high infant mortality rate, - where you have, uh, - Lead poisoning, - where you have inadequate - Medical service, we saw... we saw the basic need for free medical service, and we worked hard and worked over long period of time, in order to make that a reality. - Now up to this day - In the Black community, - you have doctors there - Who are more concerned with private wealth rather than public health. The concept behind the medical center is that we will take the profit out of the medical profession. Our medical center is a direct result of the basic need in the Black community for free medical service. [ Indistinct conversations ] You had this done about three days ago, - you said? - Hmm. - This is not - The burned hand? Right. Oh. Does it feel painful? - Like it's infected - And everything? No, it's not painful. - That's good. - Looks good. - We got doctors - For every day this week. Next week we got... No, we need one for next Thursday. Come to the clinic tomorrow for an appointment. - Rush: What about... - What are the chances - we get an ambulance - Down here? We can buy an ambulance. That's about the best chance. Well, what about... Idea's alright, but... - you know, - The idea's alright, - but we just gotta have money - To get an ambulance. - But can't you get - A used ambulance? Yeah. I tell you, I'm gonna bring a couple of pharmacists from the hospital where I am. - They're gonna come out - And see. - They're interested - In working, you know. Satchel: We can have patients come through, see a doctor. After they gets through, get tests, what have you, - then they comes in - And see the people's advocate. That's a community person or personal partner who acts like a liaison between the center here itself and the community. He asked me, what type of service - they thought they got here, - In the center. You know, any other criticisms of the medical center itself. It's also to deal with problems - outside medical problems, - You know. People's advocate has a resource file. In this file, we have, uh, teachers, uh, sociologists, speech therapists, social workers. You know, this is all a part of resource files. Hampton: Okay, well, look it here. Look it here. He'll sit over here and talk about all that jail time - he had behind - His motherfucking badge. I said, "I got the rap, too." [ Speaks indistinctly ] [ Cheers and applause ] This is Bobby Rush. - The Deputy Minister - For the state of Illinois. Bad motherfucker. You can tell the way Chairman Bobby Seale - feels the way - About Huey P. Newton. I feel the same way about Bobby Rush. [ Crowd cheering ] - We didn't start - The Black Panther Party, but we do know this... - That we are some - Bad motherfuckers. - -Right on! - -Right on! - The Black Panther Party - Gonna remain here in the state of Illinois. - -Right on! - -Right on! - You know, some time - We get to talking, - and I go to court, - And they say "Well, Fred"... I come back and Rush say, - "Fred, we got to keep you - On the streets." - Then Rush'll go to court, - And he come back, - and I'll say, "Rush, we got - To keep you on the streets." And after we just went back and forth, we decided that we liked each other so well, - Goddamn it, - We're gonna both stay on the motherfuckin' streets. [ Crowd cheering ] Ain't nobody goin' nowhere. They ain't taking us nowhere. - we gonna stay right here - With the people. We are gonna have to move, - and we're gonna - Have to move fast, - we're gonna - Have to move hard, - and we're gonna have - To move organized. To be able to keep Bobby Rush on the streets. - They got our field secretary, - Sams, Jr., up against the wall. - They got our Minister - Of Information up against the wall. Everybody... They even got Chairman Fred up against the wall. Everybody against the wall. They even talking about giving folks 20 years, talking about giving me 20 years. They did... For the ice cream truck robbery. [ Laughter ] That's right. $71 worth of ice cream, 710 ice-cream bars. I might be big, but I can't eat 710 ice-cream bars. [ Laughter and applause ] - But even though - They tried to give me all that bad publicity, they still came out, in the end, showing the true nature of a capitalist. - Because they said I went in - To the truck, beat up this pig that was in our community, exploiting people, took the ice-cream bars from him, handed them out to the kids. [ Cheers and applause ] - Even though - They made me a thief, - they made me - A Robin Hood-type thief. Yay to the people. Here is a man of the revolution, people. - Deputy Minister of Defense - For the state of Illinois, bad motherfucker, a brother of mine, - a brother I've been working - With a long time and will continue to work with. - I'm gonna eat with him, - I'm gonna sleep with him, - I'm gonna die with him, - I'm gonna live with him, I'm gonna lead with him... Bobby Rush. [ Cheers and applause ] Hello! Hello! - We gonna take the case - To the people, and the people said that Fred is gonna remain free, - that Fred is innocent of - Anything against the people. He might be, uh, guilty of, uh, fuckin' - with the power structure, - But we can relate to that. Power to the people, and we are gonna move on this power structure, like Bobby said, - we gonna say, "Get up - Against the wall, motherfucker, - because this is a hold-up, - And we came to get what's ours." Thank you. [ Cheers and applause ] Hampton: Okay, now, we're gonna organize the movement so big to make sure that the leaders of the Black Panther Party in this state are not political prisoners - and are not exiled - Or are not killed, - that that movement - Is gonna be so big that we might even have to go and get Huey P. Newton and let him carry a sign. - We gonna have everybody - Involved. We're gonna have everybody involved. And we gonna start a thing called "Free Fred." Don't that sound nice? Hey, let's do that. "Free Fred!" - -Free Fred! - -Free Fred! - -Free Fred! - -Free Fred! Free Fred! Free Fred! - Hampton: - Hey, I ain't even in jail yet. - Bailiff: The state of Illinois - Versus Fred Hampton. The Honorable Judge Elijah presiding. The defense will call its first witness. I'd like you, again, to describe to me - what happened, - If anything, - after you - And Officer Dunn - had pulled - Onto the school ground. Uh... well, I identified you as the person who, uh, grabbed me by the throat and held me down in the ice-cream van. We were walking, looking through the crowd, and looking for the one that beat him up. And what, if anything, did he say when he saw me? - Or what, if anything, - Did you say to him? Who said something first? He said, "That's him. I'll never forget his face. That's the one." Okay, now, when that police car pulled up, - what, if anything, - Happened? Well, the policeman... - One policeman was on the outside - Of the car, and one was on the inside of the car. - Officer Dunn - Pointed to Fred, and said, "That's the man that did it, isn't it?" Mm-hmm. And the ice-cream man, um, he said, "Yes, I think so." So in other words, the officer pointed out me as being the... the... the person who had robbed this man. And in response to that, after that, the, um, ice-cream truck driver said, - "Uh, yes, - That's the man." That's right. What race were these policemen? One was White, and one was colored. Right on. [ Laughter ] Hampton: Officer Dunn, do you know the defendant, Fred Hampton? - Dunn: - Yes, I know Fred Hampton. Do you know, of, uh, basically what Fred Hampton stands for? Politically. No, I don't. Uh, Officer Dunn, do you know... do you know the... the... the situation that... - poor people, Black people - And White poor people and the brown people are in in this country today? Well, not completely. But you do know... - That part that you do know, - Does that part include the fact - that, uh, - These people are being, uh, oppressed, by the White people, that, uh, like to oppress people to make profit? Do you know that? Judge: Sustained. Let me rephrase the question. Do you know, uh, a whole lot of, uh, blood-sucking pigs are vampires - [ Laughter ] Do you know, uh... Do you think you're free, Officer Dunn? Dunn: Yes, I think I'm free. No more questions, Officer Dunn. God help you. So we say, as we always say at the Black Panther Party, - that they can do - Anything they want to to us. We might not be back. I might be in jail. I might be anywhere. - But when I leave, - You can remember - I said, with the last words - Out of my lips, that I am... a revolutionary. - And you're gonna have to - Keep on saying that. - You are gonna have to say - That I am a proletariat. I am the people. I'm not the pig. You got to make a distinction. - And the people are going to - Have to attack the pigs. - The people are going to have - To stand up against the pigs. - That's what the Panthers - Are doing, - and that's what the Panthers - Are doing all over the world. We have brought to trial here Fred Hampton. You are here to judge between two conflicting testimonies. Somebody is lying. Now reason stands... The reason is very clear here, that Private Jones, who had come from Sanford, North Carolina, would have no great desire to see Fred Hampton up in this trial. But, Fred Hampton, a key figure in this community, has great reason for not wanting to be put, uh, in jail. But the state's attorney and the state's attorney office has reason to see Fred Hampton in jail. We've got a new state's attorney, you see? And he said already what he's all about. People that had different, uh, political beliefs than he had. His speeches sound somewhat like those of Hitler. And we know why he wants to see Fred Hampton put in jail. - Why do I have a lot of arrests? - Because of harassment. Why is there harassment? - Because the people - That harass me has set up a problem that made me disagree with them violently, - and they... they set up - This problem in order to exploit me and other people like me. And why do they want to get rid of me? - Because I'm saying something - That might wake up - some other exploited people, - And some other oppressed people. - And if all these people - Ever get together, - then these pigs - That are exploiting us, - we'll be able to - Run into the lake. - That's why they want - To get rid of us. And, it's just, uh, it's sort of like a primary thing with me. I'm the... the first move that they'll make. I'm a part of the organization - that will be the first - Organization they'll move on - because I happen to be - A part of an organization in the Black Panther Party, - that is the only organization, - In fact, - that has came out - And stood up, loud and clear, - and said that we don't care - What anybody says, whether they have guns or not and badges or 18 uniforms, - if whenever they step outside - The bounds of legality, - into the bounds of illegality, - We will blow they brains out. - If they bother the people. - -Right on. And what makes them mad about that? - They constantly bothering - People. - Anybody that's out there - For the protection of the people - happens to be - In direct conflict with them. What makes them mad about it? What makes them mad about it is, that they had Black people - and White poor people - And red poor people - and Puerto Rican poor people - And Latin American poor people of poor people of all descent. - They had them caught up in - Their movements based on racism - when the Black Panther Party - Stood up and said, - "We don't care - What anybody says. - We don't think to fight fire - With fire. - We think to fight fire - With water." - We gonna fight - Racism not with racism, - but we gonna fight - For solidarity. - We say we not gonna fight - Capitalism with Black capitalism, - but we going to fight it - With socialism. - We stood up and said, "We not - Going to fight reactionary pigs - and reactionary state's - Attorneys like this and reactionary state's attorneys like Hanrahan - with any other reactions - On our part." - We're going to fight - Their reactions - with all of us people - Getting together - and having an international, - Proletariat revolution. - -Right on. - -Right on. - Hampton: And that's saying - All power to the people. - They're saying that - No matter what color you are, you go into two classes. - And they're saying, - "There's a class over here, and there's a class over there." - And the reason - That this class over here - has never did anything to get - This class off its back, - because this is lower, - This is upper, this is the oppressed, this is the oppressor, - this is the exploited, - This is the exploiter. - And these people in this class - Have divided themselves - and said, "I'm Black, - And I hate White people. - I'm White, and I hate - Black people. - I'm Latin American, - And I hate hillbillies. I'm hillbilly, and I hate Indians." - So we fighting - Amongst each other. And you heard the testimony of pigs here, - and you got pigs of all colors, - You know that. - You got pigs that are White, - You got pigs that are Black. You've even got pigs that are Black and White. - Propagating the same type - Of madness that, uh, this buffoon Hanrahan would be propagating if he were here himself. And why? Because they want to keep you to believing that I'm your enemy. And that everybody else that's Black and that wears a lot of hair on his head and hair on his face, - they want to keep you - Thinking that he's your enemy. Why? Because if ever you were to disregard him - and overlook him - Just for a minute - and throw away the cause - Of the racism and start to dealing with a little logic, then they can be beaten. - There would be no one else - You could attack - other than Hanrahan, - Other than Daley and other than "Tricky Dicky" Nixon. - If you make the right decision, - Then the oppressed people - of the world - Get complete satisfaction. - I know you'll return the verdict - Of "Not Guilty." Thank you. Man ♪3: Today is May 1st. Huey P. Newton's trial is up for appeal today. Free Huey! Free Huey! Free Huey! Free Huey! Free Huey! Free Huey! - -Free Huey! - -Free Huey! Man ♪3: Our Chairman Fred Hampton has not arrived yet. The pigs are trying to incarcerate him. These are some of the things we have to deal with. Somebody, somewhere knows what happened to Fred this afternoon. So dig, you motherfuckin' pigs, get off your dead asses, FBI, and J. Who Edgar, and go and find Fred before 7:00. [ Crowd cheers ] You find Fred, motherfucker. - -Right on. - -Right on. Rush: And if anybody's out there with him that's harming him or that's kidnapped him, and he happens to be a pig, well, then we just don't discriminate about who... whose ass we gonna kill. - -Right on! - -Right on! [ Indistinct yelling ] Rush: So y'all go home now, and, uh, grease some pieces. - -Right on! - -Right on! And set them sights, and what-not... - -Right on! - -Right on! raise the windows. Right on!

The immediate, violent, criminal reaction of the occupants in shooting at announced police officers emphasizes the extreme viciousness of the Black Panther Party. So does their refusal to cease firing at the police officers when urged to do so several times. This is 2337 West Monroe, described by police as a depot for Black Panther Party arms and ammunition. 14 State's Attorney's policemen, led by Sergeant Daniel Groth, found out indeed it was a depot for weapons. After a 15-minute gun battle that cost Illinois Black Panther Party Chairman Fred Hampton his life, Sergeant Groth described the raid as 15 minutes of hell and a miracle. A miracle because not one policeman was killed, a miracle because not more policemen were shot. - The firing stopped only when - The occupants realized their arsenal was no match for the police arsenal... an arsenal that included a 45-caliber sub-machine gun and two shotguns. - Andrew: - What they didn't understand and what Edward V. Hanrahan doesn't understand and what Richard Jolbeck's chief assistant didn't understand and what those police officers - who put those two bullets - In his skull and in his head as he lay asleep didn't understand, and what Richard Nixon and his assistant lackey Mr. Mitchell don't understand, is that you can't kill Chairman Fred. - -Right on! - -Right on!

[ Applause ] What they didn't understand... What they didn't understand when they did that is that pigs die but Chairman Fred lives. You are ones who are gonna decide for yourselves what happened in that apartment on the morning of December 4th. You are gonna decide whether or not Fred Hampton and Mark Clark were the victims of premeditated murder. At this time, there's no response from within. I take my revolver in my right hand, and I pound... possibly four or five or six times. A voice from within... a male voice from within... replies, "Who's there?" I respond, "Police officers. I have a search warrant. Open the door." Hanrahan: "As soon as Sergeant Daniel Groth and Officer James Davis, who were leading our men, announced their office, occupants of the apartment attacked them with shotgun fire." I wait several seconds. - There's no replies from within. - The door's not open. I again take my revolver with my right hand. I wait a second or so. A male voice from within the apartment says, "Just a minute." - Reporter: There was - No response from the group? There was no verbal... was the firing of a shotgun blast at our police officers. There was no verbal response? - The response to - Our police officers was the firing at them by a person in the apartment. - Didn't they ask - Who it was several times? When the police officers, uh, announced their office, they were fired upon. Didn't they ask who is it at the door? I looked at Duke. I said, "Okay, Duke." Davis: Go in... Go in over to about here. And I hit the door, and I go to the bed. Duke forces this door here open. - Simultaneously with that, - We enter. A shot rings out, Duke falls off in this direction. I enter in a semi-erect position. There's a woman lying on the bed with a shotgun, calmly pumping it, pointed at my direction and fires. The, uh, fire illuminates her face. I get a very good look at her. I feel something go over my left shoulder. I then step back here. I look in, get up on my toes, point my revolver, look in again, cover my face and fire several shots at the girl. I heard a knock on the door. They said, "Policemen," told us to open up. - And Mark Clark said, - "Just a minute." He got up, and next thing I knew, they had busted into the door and came in shooting. They shot me, they shot Mark Clark. This woman fires a shot, and she... - The illumination apparently - Illuminates... - the dang shooting illuminates - The fella - sitting behind the door - In a chair. He's pumping his shotgun. I turn in his direction. I fire two shots at him. He stands up. I stand up with him. We struggle. He falls down over the chair on the floor - with his head facing - The corner of the door here and the wall. I fall across his body. - This here is the room - Where first brother Mark Clark was murdered at. - Man ♪9: Don't touch nothin', - Don't move nothin', 'cause we want to keep everything just the way it is. Don't touch no walls. Please don't. Okay, this here is the door that they said sister fired through with the shotgun. - If the sister had fired - Through this door with a shotgun, you can look at the wall out there and see some, uh, holes - where the pellets - Had left out there. You can see no signs of a shotgun blast - being fired - Through this door here. Reporter ♪2: Sir, you say your men were fired upon? - Witnesses who have seen - The apartment say there is no evidence of bullets from the direction where the, uh, Panthers supposedly were to be. I said that, uh, after our officers announced their, uh, purpose and their station several times, uh, they were fired upon from within the room. We say this is nothing more than a fascist lie to justify the murder that took place in this crib here. The doorway here is absent of a door. The door's been removed and is now in possession of our defense attorney - and is going to be used - In our case - to prove - That what happened here was nothing more than murder. After days of maneuvering, Black Panther attorney Francis Andrew finally brought a bullet-punctured door panel to the inquest. However, a controversy immediately arose - as to whether Andrew's panel - Was the same one that was removed from the Black Panther apartment. This is Andrew's version. Reporter ♪3: Which side is the outside, sir? Andrew: The outside, uh, you're looking from the inside now. - Looking from - The inside now? - Yes. - Look out this side. - Reporter ♪4: - This the inside? This is the outside. - It looks like the door is - Splintered on both sides. - You'll see that - There's a hole up here, - which none of the police in - Their testimony have mentioned, as a matter of fact, they have denied. This hole up here, it shows a bullet coming from the outside to the inside. - The hole - At the bottom there? The hole at the bottom is a hole that was made - while the door - Was standing wide-open. Assistant State's Attorney Nicholas Motherway - says Andrew could've gotten - The door panel at any lumberyard. - Motherway's point was backed up - At least in part by a police crime-lab technician, - who examined the door - In the Panther apartment the same day as the raid. - The technician said, - First of all, - that there was only one hole - In the panel the day he examined it. - And second of all, he said - That he couldn't be sure - the panels were one - And the same. Andrew: It is December 4, 1969, at 10:54 a.m. My name is Skip Andrew, and I am at 2337 West Monroe Street, Chicago, Illinois. This door, which is the door entering into the living room, has two holes in it. - This one I'm pointing - To right here, 10 inches from the edge, and this one, uh, down here, 12 inches. Uh, the first one I referred to is 25 from the top, and the second one 36 from the top. - Now, as you open this, - There's also, of course, a knob door in this one. As you open this door, there's, uh, blood behind the door. The, uh, top hole shows that the bullet was incoming. They fired through the door - and hit the brother - Through the door. The brother fell here, - and most of the blood - Is dried up, - but you can see - A little bit of it there - and a little bit of it - On the floor. - The brother was shot four - Or five times. - So after they came - Through the door, - they shot him again - To make sure he was dead. Mr. Montgomery, Dr. Constantino testified today - that Mark Clark - Could not have struggled - after receiving - That shot through the heart. - Now, in your mind, - Does this contradict - the testimony - Of Officer Davis, who described a struggle? Uh, yes, it seems to me - that was a very - Startling thing. We also learned that, uh, the bullet which was, in fact, recovered from Mr. Hampton's body was a bullet fired out of a carbine by Officer Davis. So that indicates also that Officer Davis, uh, may well have walked into that back bedroom, - contrary - To his testimony, - and fired a shot into the body - Of Fred Hampton at one point in time or other. - Carmody: - There were six others assigned to the back door. I came up on the back porch. I placed myself to the right of the door. - I put my head down enough - So I could hear if there was any conversation in the building. I heard people talking in the front, and then I heard a loud, uh, shot, sounded like a shotgun. I backed up and kicked the door open. I started in, and before I could get past the threshold, there were three shots fired from the rear bedroom. They were directed directly at the back door, uh, as I was coming in. I backed out again. Hanrahan: Only by the grace of God, uh, - were one of our... or two - Of our police officers prevented from being killed, uh, when they were fired upon - as soon as they announced - Their office and knocking on the door. Andrew: On December 11, 1969, the "Chicago Tribune" carried a story that had characterized as an exclusive version - from the State's Attorney's - Office. Reporter ♪5: Why was the exclusion made in the "Chicago Tribune"? Because that newspaper, the "Chicago Tribune," in my opinion, gave a very balanced, fair report of the events that occurred. - It has nothing to do - With the class of people, - or the type of people - That buy the "Tribune" - as opposed to other papers - In the city? Does anybody have a sensible question? Andrew: Included in the exclusive was a photo, carefully circled to show bullet holes supposed to be in the back door. - The account that - We made public yesterday gives a detailed explanation of what happened in that apartment. I stand whole-heartedly behind it as absolutely accurate. - Reporter ♪6: There is - One inconsistency. Well, for example... I do not intend to quibble about that account. - Do you intend - To get the truth? The account that we gave of the events is the truth. - One of the four pictures - You gave the "Tribune" - had two bullet holes - In the right side of what was supposed to be the rear door. Rush: Hanrahan has lied before, he's gonna lie again. - That... that hole that - He's blown up in the paper is, uh, the hole of a nail. - Man ♪10: Tight close-up - Of the nail head. - Man ♪11: Plus a little bit - Of the door hasp. Plus the door hasp. Mm-hmm. Here you see the large nail heads being pointed out. I have said that, uh, we released the pictures. We have not characterized or described, uh, the, uh, conditions that they portray, other than to say that that is an accurate portrayal of that, uh, particular object. - if any of the four pictures - They received - had portrayed bullet holes - In any of the walls? [ Stammers ] - Andrew: Another photo claimed - To show the bullet-riddled door across from the bedroom. The officers testified that the Panthers fired into that door from inside their bedroom. In fact, the door in the photo was the bedroom door, and the holes in the door were made by police gunfire at the Panthers. As you can see, the bathroom door is intact. Not only the bathroom door, but the entire wall area is intact. There was a... there was a picture of the, uh, the inside of the door to the bathroom, yes. - Reporter ♪9: That door, - Our reporters discovered, - corresponded to one - On the front living room adjoining the bedroom. - There were holes - In the door. When the door was opened, those holes corresponded - to holes - That were in the wall adjoining between the bedroom and the living room. - When they stuck a stick - Through the holes, they all matched up. I have... I make... As I say again, I make no evaluation of the pictures, other than to say they portray conditions - as they existed - In that apartment at the time those pictures were taken. This is the door that is supposed to contain numerous marks, from, uh, stray shotgun blasts, small-arms fire, which again was fired by members of the "vicious" Black Panther Party, who was standing in this bedroom here, - shooting out - Into the hallway here. I urge... I urge your inventory of each of these vicious weapons. This attack... this attack by the Black Panthers on the police, plus the weapons which were recovered, uh, at the, uh, depot where they were storing them, clearly demonstrates the true character of the Black Panther Party. - Nobody... - I have never denied - that there - Was no weapons there. - As a matter of fact, - He would be a fool - if he didn't - Have a weapon there, - knowing, uh, the ferociousness - Of the pigs, - how they just jump out - Of the cars and shoot you down, - how they knock on your door - And blow, uh, - 19-year old sister's - Head off with shotguns, - how they kill two brothers - In one week. - Yeah, he's... - And as a matter of fact, - everybody that's concerned - Should have - something in their homes - To protect themselves because Hanrahan is a madman. - Reporter ♪10: Mr. Hanrahan, - Can you tell me - why your officers - Did not try to use tear gas? - Isn't this - The usual procedure to flush someone out of a building? Our officers, uh, used the means necessary to effect the search and to present... prevent themselves from being killed upon after they were... - killed after - They were fired upon. Isn't it true that you usually use... your men usually use, uh, tear gas, - in situations - Such as this? - And why didn't they use it - This time? No, that is not true. They came with murder on they mind, you see? - Even if they wanted - To take somebody to jail, - it would have been - A simple matter - of just shooting some tear gas, - And it'd brought everybody out. Right on. This is where our Chairman had his brains blown out, as he, uh, laying in bed, sleeping at 4:30 in the morning. Someone came into the room, started shaking the Chairman. - Said, "Chairman, Chairman, - Wake up. The pigs was mapping." Still half asleep, I looked up, and I saw bullets coming from it looked like the front of the apartment, from the kitchen area. They were... pigs just shooting. And, uh, about this time, I jumped on top of the Chairman. He looked up. Looked like all the pigs just converged into the entrance way to the bedroom area, back-bedroom area. Mattress is just going. You could feel the bullets going into it. I just remember thinking they dead, everybody in there. Um... when he looked up, he just looked up, he didn't say a word, he didn't move except for moving his head up. He lays his head back down to the side like that. He never said a word. He never got up off the bed. - Um, the person - Who was in the room, - he kept hollering out, - "Stop shooting, stop shooting! - We have a pregnant woman, - A pregnant sister in here!" At that time, I was 8 1/2, 9 months pregnant. My baby was to be delivered in two weeks. Pigs kept on shooting. So I kept on hollering out, and finally they stopped. They pushed, um, me and another brother by the, uh, kitchen door. He told us to face the wall. Heard a pig say, "He's barely alive. He'll barely make it." I assumed they were talking about Chairman Fred. So then, they started shooting. The pigs... they started shooting again. I heard a sister scream. They stopped shooting. A pig said, "He's good and dead now." - Pigs running around laughing. - They were really happy. You know, talking about Chairman Fred is dead. I never saw Chairman Fred again. Inflammatory statements and false charges - against our office - Have been made by spokesmen - for the Black Panther Party - And others, despite the fact that the speakers had no reliable knowledge about the occurrence. - Well, the best account - That I can give, is, uh, the room where I was in, uh, the actions of things surrounding me personally, you know, first thing I remember, when I woke up, was, uh, a knock on the door, and it was only a matter of seconds. In fact, I would say it was less than 5 seconds that I heard, you know, shots. - Now, the thing that struck me - Was that, I not only heard shots, but I can see plaster coming out of the walls... of the... of the walls in my room. - So, I knew that the bullets - Were coming through the room that I was in. I stepped over, and I put the machine gun, still on single-fire, and I started from the left side of the wall, coming across, watching where the rounds were hitting. And I went over the girl's head, down on the other side of her, and continued fire across this wall. One strange thing about this wall is this... State's Attorney's Gestapo raiding pigs say that they fired, uh, numerous, uh, slugs, going up and down, up-and-downward motion, attempting to avoid hitting the people in the apartment here. You notice that all these slugs are on a straight line. You also notice that all were fired at a low level, at about bed level. - Next thing I remember is, - Uh, someone... - I think - It was one of the pigs... - told us to come - Out of the room. - But there were still shots - Being fired. Now, I didn't know at this here time - that people had came... were - Coming through the back door, - but I took it - That shots were being fired - at the back of the house - And at the front of the house. And, uh, you know, they were all coming through the walls. The walls were nothing but plaster board. And, you know, a bullet - will come through the front - Of the house and go all the way through, out the back. Somebody told us to get out, - but I remember - We were so afraid... the bullets were still coming... that we remained on the floor. I heard another pause, and then one of the pigs told us that, - if we don't come out, he was - Gonna put something in there that would really get 'em out. The idea came to my mind that they were gonna shoot tear gas or something in there. We realized that there were still some people remaining in the front bedroom. We don't know whether they're injured or not, so I plead. I beg them to come out, - "Please come out with your hands - Up, pull out your weapon." But the next thing I heard was a barrage of shots, real fast. And, uh, you know, we were hit this time. I started with the gun, still on single-fire, being very careful - and watching where - Each round hit on the wall. I walked them around, uh, the girl sitting on the bed, and brought it all the way across the wall again. As I was doing this, Officer Davis was stepping up, and he started firing across the wall, from right to left. I put one shot in the door. I put a short burst with the machine gun on automatic fire into that closet. I fired four or five shotgun blasts into the bedroom. The second form, still coming up, caught a blast as the gun came further across the room. They told me, uh, you know, to get up and walk. And I told them I couldn't. And then I think they hit me. - Then some of they told me - They'd kill me if I stay there. So I kept trying. I managed to, you know, get up, and, uh, I made a little hop, and I finally hopped out. You know? I am taking the word of our policemen, uh, over what we understand is supposed to be a version provided by a defense attorney and by the occupants of the apartment. I was hit five times. I was hit, um, two times in the stomach, one time in the leg, and I was hit... grazed in each hand. Yeah. This is just a scar, you know. I had to have a section of my colon taken out because of infection. I was shot over here. Hanrahan: I expect the general public to recognize the quality of these men's work and the political consequences can take care of themselves. - Reporter ♪11: Do you plan - To resign, sir? Of course I don't plan to resign. - He's changed the story - Every time, - uh, from newspaper to newspaper, - From channel... one channel to another channel, - and he's had to change the story - As we've brought up facts, truths about the evidence, uh, that he reportedly had given out. Such as the nail heads, such as the bullet holes and what-not in the walls. And it's only my conclusion, is that Hanrahan, if he wants to give an objective opinion about what happened here that morning, - he would have to come - To this apartment and find out, because he's done a whole lot of subjective analysis - because the man hasn't come - To the, uh, apartment - to find out what really did - Go down in the apartment. We have invited Hanrahan here to see for himself the evidence that we have shown to the masses of people and to the public. - Mr. Hanrahan, have you been - At the scene yourself? No, I have not been at the scene. Based on available evidence, namely the physical condition of the home and its contents, the physical conditions of the remains of Fred Hampton, the search warrant was merely a subterfuge and the mission of the police was to murder and maim. This blatant act of legitimatized murder strips all credibility from law enforcement. In the context of other acts against militant Blacks in recent months, it suggests an official policy of systematic repression. The pious statements of State's Attorney Hanrahan - concerning the brave response - Of the police, against the vicious Panther attack, and his allusion to the "grace of God" - concerning the sparing - Of the policemen, only makes the situation more macabre and terrifying. - Reporter ♪12: As an individual, - Are you convinced - that the official version - Is a lie? That it is a case of murder? Personally, I am. - Anyone who went - Through that apartment and examined the evidence that was remaining there could come to only one conclusion, and that is that Fred Hampton, 21 years old, and a member of a militant, well-known militant group, was murdered in his bed, probably as he lay asleep. It seems very clear to us that he was assassinated. - And the police officer - Who did that assassination then walked away from it, walked away from it and said to other people, "Bobby Rush is next." - Now all of you who know - Bobby Rush know that he is the Minister of Defense for the Black Panther Party and also one of our clients. And all of you also, I assume know, that Bobby Rush's apartment was broken into last night and also searched, - but fortunately for him, - He's still alive - because he was not - In the apartment. - You think that if you had been - In your apartment yesterday, - you would've been - Shot by police? Yes, I would have been murdered. - I still think there's a... - A great possibility of people trying to murder me. All the moves in the past - initially was done - On the part of the police. They murdered Fred Hampton. They are out to murder me, - just like they'll murder anybody - That's Black in this country. - Do you think there's - Gonna be retaliation then by the Panthers? - There won't be - Any retaliation by the Panthers. - I think that there are... - The time will come when the people themselves will, uh, - take the power - That belongs to them into their hands, and move, uh, to guarantee life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. - We would not be forced - Underground until the people... We really feel satisfied that we've done our duty, perform our duty to educate the masses of the people - to the injustices - That the power structure - inflicts upon poor people - In this country. All the mass demonstrations that young people endorse, this is happening right now. - Bobby, what's the next move - For you personally? I'm... My... - There's no personal anymore. - I'm the People's man. So whatever the people decide. - There's nothing personal - About it. And, uh, the Panthers will be there to serve the people. Okay. Thank you very much. - Andrew: Of course, - Numerous people have attempted - to make formal - And informal investigations, with a report by the Grand Jury for the Federal District Court, - the Northern District - Of Illinois. And I quote, "This report contains the findings of the Grand Jury after hearing nearly 100 witnesses and considering over 130 exhibits, including police records, photographs, moving pictures, transcripts of testimony before other bodies, voluminous investigative and scientific reports, - and reports - Of investigative interviews with over 100 potential witnesses who were not called." - And, of course, - Among the main witnesses before the Federal Grand Jury were the 14 raiders in the apartment, - the police officers - Who were assigned - to the State's Attorney's - Office. The report tells us, contrary to some of their testimony prior to the Grand Jury proceedings, the report tells us that, "At 4:00 a.m., on December 4, Sergeant Groth briefed the 13 assembled officers and told them the location of the raid, and that Panther arms were involved." Reporter ♪13: Did you know that they were Black Panthers? Carmody: No, we didn't. - We just knew that we were - Informed that there were guns and contraband in the building. - Did you have information - That indicated - that Fred Hampton - Might be there? Not to my knowledge. - You just knew - That there were guns, and the possibility that these may have been Black Panthers? - All we knew is there were guns - In there. - At this point, - It appears that, uh, - the people - Who are deceased were, uh, in a gun battle? - Oh, they were definitely - In a gun battle. - I mean, that they - Were firing at police? Yessir. - We saw the shots coming out - Of the two bedrooms. Sergeant Groth, of course, from the beginning claimed, along with his fellow officers, that a shot had been fired by a young Panther woman - in the far corner - Of the living-room door as the officers entered the door. The report, however, explains the impossibility of this account given by the officers. Reading again now from the report from page 181, it says, "Groth, Davis, Jones, and Gorman..." Those are all officers. "all insist that a shot was fired by Brenda Harris at them as they came in the door. None of them could explain what had become of this shot. - And it is not possible - To draw a line from the southeast corner of the living room - where Harris was said by Davis - And Groth to be on the bed holding the gun, out through the living-room door, the entrance-hall door, and the outside door. There are no holes in the west wall of the apartment." - Officer Carmody, - When you knocked on the door, what happened? Well, I didn't actually knock. I heard our officers at the front, uh, announce their office, and shots fired, uh, so I kicked in the back door. - And as soon as - The door opened, I could see, uh, shots being fired at us at the back door. - Do you have any idea - How many shots were fired? - Officer: Uh, quite a few. - I have no idea. - Any idea over - How long a period the gun battle ensued? - Seemed like - An hour to me. - Andrew: Of course the raiders - Would have us believe that they approached the apartment in a gentlemanly fashion, that they were attempting to save human life. They knocked on the door, - and they announced - Their purpose. They fired no shots until they were fired at. They called for "cease fire" on at least three different occasions. Thereafter, three times, Sergeant Groth ordered all his men to cease firing and told the occupants to come out with their hands up. Each time, one of the occupants replied, "Shoot it out." And they continued firing at the police officers. By their own testimony, they admit that, for 12 minutes, for 12 solid minutes, in those early morning hours, there was gun firing in that apartment. And yet the Federal Grand Jury concludes that only one possible shot could've come from a Panther weapon. - And that shot could've - Come through the door by a man who had just been shot in the heart. They would have us believe that, even though there was only one Panther shot, they called for a cease fire on three different occasions and didn't get it, and so they continued their firing. The great variance between the physical evidence and the testimony of the officers raises the question as to whether the officers are falsifying their accounts. Those officers fired 99 shots - through the walls - Of an apartment - where they knew people - Were sleeping. Murder is defined in Illinois as follows... "A person who kills an individual without lawful justification commits murder if, in performing the acts which caused the death, he knows that such acts create a strong probability of death or great bodily harm to that individual or another." Federal Grand Jury comes to its conclusions... "Unquestionably, the raid was not professionally planned or properly executed. And the result of the raid was two deaths, four injuries, and seven improper criminal charges." In spite of those conclusions, the report then goes on to say, "The physical evidence and the discrepancies in the officers' accounts are insufficient to establish probable cause to charge the officers with the willful violation of the occupants' civil rights." - Hampton: I want you to know - That I want you to think. - Crowd chanting: - Power to the people!
