There's a bunch of boy's camping over there. What a shame! We chose this haunted beach. To avoid other people how come they're here too? They are approaching, what shall we do? Don't worry, no one would dare to take advantage of you. But I'm afraid I can't control myself! Mad nutcase! They are afrom our neighbouring school. I wonder why they're here is it because of... Certainly not because of you! Right, because of me! Because of you? What so funny? Look at the guy in blue. He beseeched me earnestly for hours yesterday. But I just answered him briefly. What did you say? Mainly about you! He tried to gather information about you. So I told him we're camping out here today. So it's because of our lovely Juliet again! Look, how many wolves and mad dogs you have attracted. Pretty girl like me is always the source of troubles! I'm terribly sorry... Mad nutcase! Hey, your chicken wing is burning! I'm busy, you take it! Dumb jerk, you don't seem to show any response. Are we going to sleep in such a big place? Big? Why don't we invite them to join us! Mad nutcase! Look, the 5 boys are pitching five camps. What are they driving at? Very simply. They want us to sleep with them. What shall we so then? One of us will flirt with them. They'll be out of their minds and may even sleep here. Gosh, my chicken wing's burning! Same here! He's singing loson, country bumpkin! I don't understand why he sings mandrain song? Maybe he only speaks mandarin! Wrong, because our Juliet likes to speak mandarin! Gosh, you think it's going to rain? The weather forecase says it won't. It's raining, what now? Keep calm, lets get into the camp. He's still singing in the rain. He's a Romeo in real life! Romeo? I think he's a mad nutcase! I hope the wind will blow away his umbrella. I can't stand it! Same here! What are you doing? The rope is loosen! Tighten it up. Follow me! There's a temple in front, let's go in there. Okay... I'll be right back! Are you ok? Watch out! Get up are you sure you're alright? What sort a temple is this? So horrible! God, I'm wet all through! I wonder if there's a caretaker to lend me an iron. I don't thnk there'll be anybody except ghost! Don't frighten us or I'll get mad! Same here! The radio says today'll be a sunny day. I told you to change the damn old radio. What has it got to do with the weather? I'm talking to her what has it got to do with you? You think the boys will come in? Sure... I bet they will! - Let's go in to take shelter. - Alright! You think the boys will take advantage of us? How are we going to take advantage of them? Let's disguise ourselves as ghosts! No way. They will be scared away. What shall we do then? To tell ghost stories to them! I'm sure they'll hold us tightly if they're scared. Good! I've never been hold by a woman before! Let's find a favourable place. Excuse me, may we share the table? Oh no, share the temple! God ahead. Abunch of hypocrites. Marvelous... So boring, can you entertain us? Sure! Let me tell you a romantic, loving, touching and sentimential love story. Great... Are you trying to scare us away by telling ghost stories? Right, a ghost story! One dark and windy night, a flash of lighting just like now... A bunch of people ran into a ghost in a temple all of a sudden... - It's horrible! - Are you scared? A rat, a big one! A real big one! What a coward! He's even scared of a rat! Let me tell you a more horrible ghost story. Great, go ahead! Listen, ghosts hate people sitting on their table. None of my business. I smell something strange, there must a ghost around. When his spirit isn't settled it will become an ill wind you know the proverb, an ill wind brings chills. My hair's standing up on one end! My legs are like jelly! My grandma says the ghosts will find a substitute. How? Depends on one's luck. If you have bad luck, the ghost will get hold of you. This is what we called possessed. Your eyes will be blurred. As if the ghost is forcing you to do what he has done. Bonnie, what are doing? I'm demonstrating how a person's possessed. To these six cowards. Six? 1,2, 3,4, 5, 6! But there were only five of them. How come there are six now? Are they altogether six people now? Right! Yes, five in front, and one at the back. See with you own eyes if you don't believe! Help! A coward! Don't try to scare us by telling ghost stories. They screamed while they are watching at our back. - Perhaps... - Don't frighten me. No ghost. Turn around and see with your own eyes. Turn around and look! Why me? Comeon, you have guts! No way... Comeon! Alright, I'll do it. I told you there's no ghost in this world. Are you sure? See with your own eyes if you don't believe. Are you sure? A bunch of cowards! The ghost won't kill you for just a little glance. It stops raining, let's go! Yeah... packing up it's mine Get the stuff. Come on, let's go! Ok... got the lights on here! Wait for me! Hurry up! Gosh, we're here in this prison again. God, I haven't finished my homework yet. Work on it now! Twiggy! Twiggy! What's the matter? I'm in deep trouble! You haven't finished your homoe work again? Come on, give me a hand! Alright I'll finish it for you by tomorrow! You'll take care of the doggie for me. The warden's going to check the rooms today. Leave the doggie here and take it back afterwards. Thanks a lot! Mad nutcase! Hi! Honey! Mad nutcase! Honey... that rope moves... Hang on! I saw it crawling down from the desk. You must be joking! I think it's because you read playboy too much. Fortunately twiggy has fed you! I'm sorry... Bobby, are you alright? Are you tired? I'm exhausted, I want to sleep. Darling, go to bed! How indecent, I don't want to see it! Su no evil! Help! Help! What's the matter? Who's attacking you? I saw a man in manchu costumes. He just looks like a rampire. Which part of your body did he attack you? The bottom of my feet! Come on, don't try to make a fool of us! I'm serious, it's true! Where's he now? He disappeared in the air. Still thinking of the ghost story in the temple? You'll have nightmares if you're over-exhausted! Go to bed early! I just don't understand! You... who are you? I beseech thee not to get panic-stricken. I'm very sorry to intrude upon your privacy. Are you trying to Rob me? I'm not a burglar, I'm... I'm not a human being! I know you're not a human being you're a beast. How dare you sneak into a girl's room at night? And touch the bottom of my feet. You're a sex maniac! I'm not a sex maniac. I'm a ghost! You're an extra in the movies. Ridiculous, I don't believe you are a ghost! Don't be so sure, since you haven't seen a ghost before! How do you know I've never seen a ghost? Believe me, I'm a real ghost! I think you're just putting one foot in the grave! Why are you hitting a kind man? So you admit you're a man! I'm a ghost! Alright, you're a ghost! Since you don't believe, I'll show you something. Up! Stop! Keep your fingers off my clothes! You're a magician? Wrong you are... So you're a real ghost? Right you are! Help... a ghost! Please help me out! Help... a ghost! Stop yelling, it's already very late! You're a ghost, please leave me alone! I don't want to scare you, you brought me here. Only a dumb jerk did! So you're a dumb jerk! I hanged myself with this rope in the temple. And this rope becomes the abode of my spirit. So you brought here my spirit together with the rop. Yet I am not trying to harm you. What I did is just to prove my identity. Pardon me if I have intrude upon your time! Oh my god, I'm scared to death! The game's over, you may go now! You want to get rid of me? You're insulting my dignity. Actually I'm a scholar official known is bindeye. Binding your eyes? You mean binding your neck? Don't get confused! This is neck, not eye. This is eye, not neck! You died cos you bound your neck & hang yourself. You don't seem to know anything about human structure. But you know nothing about Chinese history. Bindeye is the secound place in the imperial exams. One after the winner, one above the thired. I was a bindeye in the ching dynasty. My job was in the archives. Stewart pik's my name, I'm known as scholar pik. I think you're a stupid pig. So why did you commit suicide? It's a long story! I don't want to listen to it. I'm very tired, what do you want? Please bring the rop back to the temple. No problem, after our sports day tomorrow! Thank you from the bottom of my heart, adieu! Does it mean I have tough luck? You look so pale? I ran into a ghost last night! Why did you come here? I just walked in to get changed. Why did you follow me? Are you kidding? We came here before you. You're a ghost, please leave me alone! Why are you following me everywhere? I don't want to be bored to death. I want to see this wonderful world. You're just disgusting, I can't stand you! Can't stand me? What does this mean? Someone's coming, you want to scare them away? Get lost immediately! Yes, ma am! Are you Bonnie lam from the red cotton? This is she! You're the most promising representative in f.5?

I don't force you the believe me! What are you doing here? Waiting for you! This is a ladies bathroom, get lost I like the atmosphere here! Come here! Sex-maniac, I'll bind your eyes sooner or later. Mencius said, food and sex is man's nature. This is said by confucius. What's the matter? Are you really going? Sure. Don't go away, please stay! I'll be friend with you. Friend? That means we'll be intimate and bosom friends! Intimate and bosom? Impossible. Human being & ghost can't be friends. Besides, I'm afraid. What are you afraid of? I'm afraid we'll fall in love with each other. Don't worry, I won't! But I'll. Doesn't matter, I'm a very conservative girl. I won't easily make love with you. Make love? What does that mean? That mean we'll make friends! So make love means make friends? How can a ghost make friends with a girl? A wicked ghost! A good ghost! No problem. You're not a ghost to me. You're a... A fairy! Ths most intelligent fairy in this world. Honestly I'm very intelligent. If not, I wouldn't have become a bindeye. So you should stay and help me out. You can help me to solve out many problems. My pleasure, helping people is the source of happiness. Actually I feel very happy after helping you. Right, you should stay and I'll make you happy. Come in, I'll teach you how to play electronic games. Please. What the hell is she doing? What's the matter? There must be somebody inside. None. Don't lie to us. Is there a boy inside? Across my heart, there's nobody in my room. He's not a human being. You mean he's a foreign devil? So you're going out with a foreign devil. Don't get me wrong! Introduce him to us in the school ball tonight. I'll give you 3 minutes. To bring him to our room and meet us. If not, we'll disclose the fact to everybody. Foreign devil? Scholar pik, come with me to meet my 2 friends. Nonsense, I'm a highly esteemed ching officer! They should come to see me instead. Don't be so aloof, they'll trick you! Only the ghost can trick man not the other way round! Mothing is impssible in this world. Right, unless you burn my rope. Alright, I'll meet your 2 friends. Who is it? I've brought him here! I warn you: Don't be scared. Come in! Your boyfriend is a gutless coward. Look, he's sacred away. Come out! Come out! What are you doing? Come out or I'll burn it! You have to keep calm. A 1000 year old antique will appear at your back. How are you? Good day, ma'am! Oh, it's only a dumb jerk! Are you a cantonese opera singer? Or a singer in the open-air market. I'm not a bit-actor! I was nearly the topscholar in China. Dressing up? We don't have a costume party tonight. Did you do anything indecent in Bonnie's room? I didn't... I'm a scholar. I'm well-versed in poems, and I know the rules. I'm a highly esteemed and learned bindeye. How dare you condemn me as a thired rate actor. I'm angry for you accused me of imposing as topscholar. Now... You even accused me of indecent assault. I'm innocent... Are you singing catonese operea? This is not human language. Please don't talk like a smart ass. Be more straight forward. Okay, I'll be more straight forward. If you have no objection. I'd like to make love with both of you! You're really very straight forward! I think he's out of his mind. I have already made love with her. Why can't I make love with you! So you have made love... He doesn't understand english. Actually he is a ghost from ching dynasty. But he's not a harmful ghost. I don't get it. Right, a ghost can't be so dumb. I told you the fact but you don't believe me. Show something to them to prove yourself. Alright, right away! That's the end of it. It's very dangerous to be friends with a ghost. If you're possessed, you're done, right? I don't know. What do you think? At least there's I advantage-during the sports day. It's because of his help. That I won the champion! At least there is some benefits! Is he coming tonight? Sure! You'll be able to see him. Sister. Here comes your prince charming! Boys, this way! Dumb jerk!

You attracted so many boys you really need his help! Let me give you a hand! You give me a hand? Ask my advice when you're looking for a boyfriend. You can't judge a person by this appearance. Some people may be a wolf in sheep's clothing. You won't be able to distinguish you're human being. What's your trick then? I have a secret weapon, behold and you will not see! Sit down and look at the boys over there. Why is it like that? Well, every person gives out some light. Look at the short-sighted boy he has a yellow light. That means he's a sex-maniac. Keep away from him! What about the green light? That means his eyes are blurred! He always makes mistakes. I'm sorry... What about the orange light? Simply because he drinks too much orange juice. Does the black light mean he drinks too much ink? Not really, the black light means he's unlucky, look. He hasn't got any light? That means he's colour blind. What about the rainbow colour lights? That means he's colourful man. Is it good or not? Excellent, that means he's diversified and interesting. I bet he's the right guy for you! Welcome, the ball will start very shortly. Just feel free to dance... No, you have to behave yourselves. Don't turn off the light, behave yourselves. Sister, let's go out and leave them alone! Alone? I'll keep an eye on them. May I... What a boring party! Let's get out of here! No way, bindeye pik! Bindeye pik! Here I am! We're bored to death, do you have any tricks? Because of her? Alright! Yeah! I laught the most. Happy ghost!

Smells as good as my wife's shortcakes! So you're married? What did she look like? Was she good-looking? Of course, she ws good looking! She was known as the queen of the shortcakes. Did she sell shortcakes? Right, she sold shortcakes while I studied hard! I was even known as the prince of shortcakes. So your wife supported the family? That means you're a bum! Don't insult my dignity or I'll be angry. Fame is very important to a man. People study hard to get a name. If I were the topscholar my wife would be the first lady. Just imagine how glorious it would be. I think to be lady bindeye is good enough. It should be good enough. Don't stand in the way, follow me! Let's go! Let me take a look. Nothing spectecular, move on! Stop pulling me! Why are you here? Nothing. I just want to say good night to you. Ok, go ahead! - Good night! - Good night! May I come up to say good night?

Why did you Polish your nails? Take your hans out! Stay behind after school! Why did you put on lipsticks? Because my lips are too dry... No excuse. Stay behind. Your uniform is too short. Yours too! Your uniforms should be long enough to cover your knees. I have to see your parents. Aren't you ashamed of wearing such short skirt? You're students, you have to respect yourselves. You shouldn't expose your body. You're just like Teddy girls! Your uniforms should be as long as mine. Take me as an example! Stop laughing! That's funny joke, I guess everybody's happy. That's why I say bindeye pik is very smart. Not really! He is nasty, wants to see her legs. Why are you hitting me? You're so ungreateful! Venus, your phone call. Thank you, fattie. You two carry on! Come back soon, he doesn't know how to play! Here are so many excitying games in the human world. Is it what you called dog dog ball? Ping pong ball! Yes, I knew it already!

It's a school certificate examination. If we fail in the mock exam, we'll be disqualified. You ask me to help you in the exam, how? You'l help me to cheat! You'll be my spook. No way, I hate to do this sort of thing. If I had cheated, I would have become the topscholar. Just help me then! No! You sure you won't? No... Well, if you won't help me. I'll bring the rope back to the temple. Don't try to threaten me, I won't play. A ghost! A ball! Honey... the ghost is playing ping pong ball! Mad nutcase, I told you not to read playboy again.

The exam is drawing near, don't fool around! You should concentrate on your studies! I don't want to give you pressure. I won't blame you if you don't achieve good results. Your sister is a lawyer, your elder brother's a doctor. Your younger brother is in Cambridge with scholarship. Doesn't matter if you can't make it. Try second a ttempt if you fail this time. Or just get married. Don't give yourself a hard time. Don't listen to what your dad says. He's just talking nonsense because he's exasperated. You have to work hard and pass the exam. Do this for your beloved mother. Are you sure you'll take me back to the temple? Of course, unless you promise to help me. No way, even ghost has his principle. I'm a ghost of dignity. Driver, get off! You're so nice for not talking me back! Let's get back to the hostel and have fun! Where are you going? You won't have fun there! The doctor says the abortion fee costs $5000.

We were examinated on the classics. Let me take a look again! Analyse the casue of the fall of ching dynasty. Comment on the high-pressure ching policy! I can't answer these questions or I'll be executed! I can't answer them... You're not going to answer the questions, right? What are you doing? Take a look at others paper and tell me the answer. See you! Concentrate on your work! I'll find out who did this sooner or later. My memory is completely blank, why? I studied overnight, but nothing comes to my mind? Gosh, I'm running out of time! I'll just have a quick glance... Don't do that! If everybody cheats in the exam. It'll be unfair to honest people like myself. No way! Give the book back to me. What are you doing? Venus, get out of here! Everybody stops writing! Remain on your seat until you're asked to leave. What now? You may leave now! Bonnie, what are you doing? You claimed to be a learned bindeye. And a highly esteemed scholar official, bullshit! I'm you're not a friend in need! What are you doing? None of my business! You don't even know how to answer such simple questions. And you too! I won't need your help if I know the answer! I wonder how you become a bindeye. You're insulting the diginity of your friend. Friend... What good do I get to be friend with you? I teach you english, and how to enjoy life. You are very ungrateful. I don't want to see you again! Bonnie! She's out of her mind from studying too much. Poor Venus! Venus! Venus was crying as she was heading for the hostel! Don't bother me! Venus may do something silly! Venus, get down! It's very dangerous up there. Come down! Honey! Venus, don't be silly, come over here! Life is so miserable, I don't want to live. All my sorrows will be gone if I die. Don't come near me! What shall we do? God knows? God? Bindeye pik, please come out! Bindeye pik, come out! Don't be so narrow-minded I didn't mean to scold you! Venus, please come down! I'll inform sister Lee if you won't come down. Right, go and tell sister Lee! Doesn't matter, go ahead! Help! Juliet, don't frighten me! I don't want to die yet, Bonnie! Hang on a second, I'm coming! To resuce her! Bindeye pik, don't let Venus die! Venus, I don't mean to harm you! A ghost! Balloons, balloons again! Fly away... the little space shuttle... Bindeye pik, where's Venus now? Don't worry. Just follow me! Balloons... last time is ping pong ball now balloons! What balloon? A flying bird, oh Venus! Venus has turned into a flying bird! What are you talking about? A ghost! I'm sure this hostel is haunted. I've withness with my own eyes. The girls are mingling with a ghost. Bonnie, you're not a friend indeed. Why didn't you tell me you're going to commit suicide? Will death solve any problem? Who taught you this? Life is so miserable. Maybe I'll be relieved after death! I don't think so! How do you know since you have not died before? But I have. I apologize for plunging you into such deep trouble. I don't blame you, it's my fault! I'm sure you don't want to disappoint your parents. Actually, I'm trying my best to please them. However my memory is getting worse. It became completely blank. I couldn't help but to check! It's all your fault! I'm ashamed of what I have done! If I died, I don't have to force myself to study. Actually I've thought of committing suicide too. I felt so frustrated when Joseph rejected me. And I don't know what to do with my baby. Stop crying! Bindeye pik, are you crying too? Actually I'm not a bindeye! Alright... you're the topscholar them... Okay, you're an emperor! I'm not a bindeye. I have never been a bindeye. This hat was stolen from a bindeye. I have never been a scholar official except in dreams. I became a scholar at 16, and after that year. I failed in the open exam, for 14 times. I sat for the exam at the age of 17 until I was 37. So you're even worse than myself. My father had high hopes on me! My wife prayed everyday that I would pass the exam. So that she would be the lady topscholar. And she wouldn't have to sell shortakes. What happned finally? Finally... Every scholar aims at getting a name. But I failed every time. My father when I failed for the seventh time. At his death bed, he asked me. To keep working hard to attain the position of topscholar. When I failed for the tenth time even my wife cursed me. That I would have to feed on her shortcakes forever. At the 14th time, I though I would make it. Unfortunately, I failed! Finaly my wife stoped with somebody. I was a cuckold husband. So I brought along a piece of rope. To hang myself in the temple. I thought I would be released after death. Because I had grievances, my spirit. To become reincarnated I ended up a roving spirit. Such a lonely and sad existence. You hear that! Lucky both of you didn't die! Venus, I think we're both very silly. We have been the slave of examinations. Right, I'm not silly, I have brains. You wasted a lot of time you've no ambition in life. Actually you have your parents who care for you. You've the chance to receive good education. And you got good friends you should be contented. Do you agree? Bindeye pik! Don't call me bindeye pik! Just call me scholar pik. We're going to sit for the exam again tomorrow! So you have to work harder and try your very best. Even if you fail, you won't feel sorry. Ok, you'll make coffee for us. You'll mend our socks and clean our rooms. Is this an order? Alright? Alright! Good boy! Who? Give me your school bag. No, I've got some confidential documents inside. I'm doing this for your own good. This rope helps me to abstain from eating too much. Right, there's something strange about this rope. No wonder you brought it to the exam hall! Apart from keeping a doggie you want to keep a ghost now! Burn it! Please don't... Get lost! All of you! Watch the door. Scholar pik. Get out of here! Go and jog for 1 hour! No wonder I slept in the toilet the other day. My shirt was pulled up for no reason. Now I know the tricks. He's our good friend, he won't harm us. Sister, please don't burn him. No way! Why don't you go out and start jogging! Or you'll be kicked out from the school. Keep running unless I ask you to stop! Go! Keep running! Get up! Keep running, or I'll fail you in the exam. I'm very worried about him. We can't be so ungrateful, we have to rescue him. It was destroyed! You should concentrate on your studies from now on. Scholar pik. Scholar pik. Scholar pik. Scholar pik. Where are you? Scholar pik. Please come out! You're a good friend to us! You promise to make coffee for us. And you promise... Scholar pik, it's all our fault! Bonnie! Scholar pik, our good friend forever! Let's go and burn him! Scholar pik. God, we thought you were dead. Why didn't you show up earlier, damn it! Man will die, but not the ghost! You told me you'll die if the rope is destroyed. Now I know you're deeply affected to me. I'm not! But we did hear you screaming for help. Are you sure you're alright? At first I thought I'm done. When they were burning the rope. I was so scared that my spirit flew away. You're really ok? From the time I be friends with three of you. All my woes is gone forever! I'm no longer so narrow minded, I realized something! What have you realized? It's more exciting to be a human being. Because they have ups & downs. They have ambitions to crave for. So I made up my mind to reincarnate as a man. Great, I'll give you my spiritual support. Not only that. I need your physical support. Now the rope's burnt, my spirit's attached to a bamboo. You have to take this bamboo out. So that I'll have a chance to reincarnate. Where are you carrying the bamboo to? We just want to hang the wet clothes. You must be joking, there's no sunlight! You must be talking nonsense because of the ghost. Are you alright? I have a meeting with the headmaster. We decided to give you another chance. We'll give you private tuition for 2 weeks. Ok, go ahead with hanging your clothes! Watch out! Hang on! What's the matter? I'll teach him a lesson, let's go... Honey! You so of a bitch, reading the playboy again. I'll cut you into pieces! Here it is! I've got to go at 12:00 pm sharp. We won't be able to see each other again. Keep an eye on the new born babies. - Maybe I'll be one of them. - Right! Promise me one thing! In the coming inter-school 100 metre spring semi-final. I hope you'll try your best to win without my help. Impossible, tarzen ko will win over me. You'll succeed if you persevere and have confidence. I'm sure you'll win. I'll give you my spiritual support. It's time for me to go! Good bye, my 3 darlings! Scholar pik! Scholar pik! Scholar pik! On your Mark! Set! Try your very best, I'm sure you'll make it. Scholar pik... I made it! Bonnie! - One more! - Here! Although I have worked hard I still failed in the exam. However I'm very excited. For I will represent Hong Kong. In the Asian youth olympic games. I am studying in teachers training school. My ambition is to become a good teacher. Besides, I met my better half. Finally I got married with joesph. He's working as a clerk in the central. I gave birth to a 9 lb baby boy! Look at your baby, he looks so weird. Right, why is it like that? It's very strange? He looks like scholar pik! Is it the reincarnation of scholar pik? Bindeye pik! Bindeye pik! Call me dad!
