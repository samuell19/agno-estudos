[MUSIC PLAYING] [HONKING] Locking in on the asshole from the Lone Star state, Captain. [HONKING] -Aye! That Texan's toast, Captain! [HONKING] Go get him, you redneck cling on. Aye, Captain, we be low on fuel. [KNOCKING] Looking for a party? Looking for a party? Hey, baby, come here. Let me see what my money can buy. Still some miles on that odometer. How much? 50. You can take it straight, but I'm best when you let me take control. Come on. Come on. Let's go. If I wanted a statue, I'd go around with a mannequin. Don't you recognize me? That ain't fair. You got your clothes on. Look at my face. Mira? Ireland You're all grown up now. And you're a hooker, what a surprise. Is that all you got to say to me? You and I never have much to say. Come on. Let's go. Let go of me. Let go! Come on, sweetheart, like old times. No! Let go of me! let go of me! Haven't learned not to fight me? No! [GASPING] OK? Hey? Hey? [COUGHING] No! No! Let me go! No! [GASPING] No! No! No! Hello, hello. [SCREAMING] Oh my God. Oh, shit! -God! God damn! -Please! You gotta get me out of here! -What? He tried to rape me! He's going to kill me! [GUNSHOT] [SCREAMING] Please! Please go! [GUNSHOT] Hey! Hey, Ah, damn! [PANTING] Look, you need to slow down, all right? You're hyperventilating. Here, hold this over your mouth. [SCREAMING] Put this over your mouth! [PANTING] We've had a hit and run at the milepost 126 truck stop off Interstate 5! 126, copy. What happened? Some hooker tried to roll me. Kind of wish you had blown those assholes away. Still got time. Hey, the Smoky is on his way! Miya. Miya, oh, right, right, Trent. Listen, the guy back there, you sure he tried to rape you? You're a prostitute, right? And how do you rape a prostitute? Is that it? I'm sorry. [CRYING] -Who the hell are you calling? -The cops! And what? Get arrested on a hit and run? Look, you were almost raped. We were shot at. Almost! you, on the other hand, did hit and did run. And you answered it yourself. Who the hell is going to believe a prostitute crying rape? That guy back there with the shotgun that tried to rape me, that's my father. This is the first time he didn't get what he wanted. I'm-- I'm sorry. '68 Mustang driven by punk trash, involved in a hit and run. Anybody? Over. [MUSIC PLAYING] Will that be all? Uh, yeah, I'll have a quart of Bourbon. Whoo, god this material just doesn't breath. You probably haven't seen a pair like these, huh? Or at least not in the flesh. But you do have a favorite, don't you? I do. Is this all? Yeah, um, why don't you give me cigarettes, in the hard pack? So is she blonde, brunette? Stocking and heels, or raw? How old are you, 15? 16. Let me see if I can kind what page she's on. Um, anything other than the beer, the bourbon, and the cigarettes? I'm thinking. Damn, Roxy's got more plastic in these titties than Barbie. All right, that's, uh-- Let's try page 69. Pack of cigarettes. No, let's try page 90. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Found her. Here, here, just take them and go. It's OK, sweetie, you don't have to be embarrassed. [GRUNTING] No respect! Particularly rough bowel movement? Your little friend caught up with you, huh? Here, this will help. I-- I don't think so. Come on. We'll split it. No splitting, this one's for you, medicinal purposes, one every five minutes. Oh, and a swig of this, subside the pain. What do you want me to get a DUI? You won't if I'm driving. Um, look, when my parents gave this to me for graduation, I promised them that no one else would drive it but-- There's no one else out on the road, right? And my parents will never know. All right. [ENGINE REVVING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHTER] [MUSIC PLAYING] I must have dozed off. Your parents made you drive 20 miles out of your way just to catch a freebie off some friends? Yeah, they thought it would be safe. Now, would you get in the back? Come on. Or maybe they thought you'd be watched. Come on, come on. Normal Rockwell lives. Hurry, hurry, hurry, stay down. Ever since the accident, Emily's been a little sensitive about drinking and driving. I'm sorry, bad choice. Hey, there's nothing wrong with knocking back a few. Your old man and I, we had plenty of wild nights. But not when we had a 600-mile drive ahead of us. Relax, nobody needs to know. Thanks, I appreciate it. Hey, it's our pleasure. Look, I'm going to catch some sleep. I'll help you with your bags. -Actually, I'll manage. -Sure. It's a beauty, huh? Wild west, huh? Up here isolated like we are, you never know what comes crawling in. I got quite a collection I could show you. I'm a little tired. Tomorrow, OK. Cabin five, sleep it off, huh? Hi, Mom. MOM: At the Fosters? Yeah, we just got here-- I just got here. MOM: How are Tom and Emily? I hope you thanked them. What was that? MOM: I hope you thanked Tom and Emily. Yeah, I said thanks right away. MOM: How's the cabin? Yeah, the cabin's great. MOM: Please be on your best behavior. You did thank them, right? What was that? MOM: I said, you did thank them? Yeah, I said thanks right away. Yes, yeah, I promise. Uh-huh. [COUGHING] No, Mom, I don't have a cold. Yeah, I love you too, Mom. Bye. Wait a minute. I didn't sneak you in here so you could put on a peep how. You know, you really have to stand up to your parents. Do me a favor. Keep the drapes open just a little bit. I want you to see me. Whoa. [MUSIC PLAYING] Ow! [MUSIC PLAYING] [WHIMPERING] [MOANING] [SIRENS] Odometer said 65. Registration is current? Let me see your driver's license, please. There was a hit and run about 45 miles down the road. Did you see anything? Well, he checked in at the last weigh station. Registration, everything checked out. Can I go? All right, you can go. You just drive careful, OK? -Yeah. Hey, go on. [HONKING] Always peep on your guests? I was just checking on the boy. Boy? No, he entered manhood while you were fogging up the window. Relax. It's just a cigarette. Can I get what the boy got? So you want me to, uh, bend and spread so you can get it on for 30 seconds? More like a marathon, baby. And I'll pay. Oh, really? What about Betty Crocker on wheels? Nobody has to know. You know, we'd have a lot more fun if you'd just trust me. Oh, it's been a while, huh? Three years. That's not a marriage. That's a life sentence. I still love her. You have to love her, and then you can screw, huh? Sorry, no sale. I can't let you walk away. Well, ask nice. Please make love to me. I'm not your wife. I want to fuck you. Without the gun. No. I want to hold it. It's the only way. Come on. This is what men have. What? Guns, to get control. But women, we have our bodies. Yeah, I guess so. Is it fair? With a body like yours, sure. It's a lethal weapon. But, you know, a man with a gun can get everything he wants. He doesn't even have to attract. He can force, and a woman has no choice. Let's see what happens when a woman has a gun. Hey. Get down on your knees. I'm not playing this game. Game? Get down on your knees. That a boy. Good. yeah. Open your mouth. Yeah, you like that? Huh? You like that? WIFE: Tom! -Paralyzed. She deserves better. What's happening? Tom? Answer me. RADIO: Car 3246, we got a 41 at Foster's Motel east on 250. Copy. Let's go. [SIRENS] [KNOCKING] State police! Open the door, please. State police! Open the door, please! Police. What's wrong? What were you doing about 3:30 this morning? Uh, sleeping, I guess, why? There was an attempted armed robbery involving Mr. Foster. Was he hurt? The suspect surprised him and wrestled his gun away from him. I don't even have a gun. I didn't ask if you owned a gun. I need to ask you a few questions. -Traveling alone? -Yes, sir. Coming from? Ohio State University. I'm a freshman. Going to? Home, for Thanksgiving. Where's home? Lancaster, Pennsylvania. There was a hit and run involving a Mustang and a trucker. Let's go look at your car. No wants, no warrants. I count five cans of malt liquor in here. Oh, that-- that, I was, you know, save the planet, recycle. The trucker said a hooker jumped in with the driver. Sounds pretty good to me. Well, according to the witness, the driver was a male, fairly young. He got a better look at him at a gas station grocery store about 35 miles back. It was a male, around 20, strong built, short dark hair. They exchanged some punches. Boy, I'm-- I'm starting to wish I was this guy. Is this is a big joke to you? No, sir. If you're protecting the hooker, I recommend you don't. No, I'm alone. Look, this is more than just a wild ride in the saddle. There's a bigger price to pay. OK, I guess that's it. If you can think of anything else that will help us, let me know. Yes, sir. -Drive careful, huh? -Thank you. Kid's got no future as a bullshit salesman. Empty wallet. Kid's just thinking with his dick. RADIO: Highway 76 heading north heavy with traffic. If you hook up with 80 just after Newscastle, it thins out. It's smooth sailing till Harrisburg. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? MOM: Four rings? I'm sorry, Mom my coat was laying over the phone. MOM: Everything was fine at the Foster's motel? Yeah, great, lots of sleep. MOM: I suppose Emily wouldn't let you go without whipping up a big breakfast. Yeah, I'm stuffed. DAD: Hey, son. Hey, Dad. DAD: Back on schedule. Yeah. DAD: All right, you've got 560 miles to go. Right, right. DAD: OK, so get your gas and lunch in Hobi. It's about 60 miles east of Burwick. OK? Now, I know you like burgers, Trent. But there's a great subway shop on Main Street. It's cheap. An it's fast. And you need to make time. MOM: Trent, it's your mother. Listen, one last thing, I-- -Hold on. I got another call coming in. Hello? MYRA: Guess who? You took my money. That was my food and gas money! MYRA: Don't take it personally. It's just business. I'll tell you what. You come back to the cafe you passed a few minutes, and I'll buy you breakfast. I wouldn't want Trent to go hungry. You are unbelievable. MOM: Trent? What was that? I'm sorry, Mom. It was a wrong number. Anyway, what were you saying? Well, I-- you know, I just want you to promise me that you're not going to pick up any hitchhikers. I promise. OK, honey, bye. Thanks, Mom, love you. All right, I'm here. So where'd you vanish to? Nowhere in particular. When did you leave the cabin? When it was dark. Why'd you take my money? I'm a hooker, remember? $360? Hey, you should have shopped around. So why'd you call me anyway? Well, I thought taking your virginity was probably enough. I never said I was a virgin. You didn't have to. Two state troopers woke me up this morning. Your cabin was speeding? No, someone tried to rob Mr. Foster this morning at 3:30. No. Yeah, a woman. And he didn't shoot her? Look, the state trooper put it all together, all right? The guy I hit, the guy I got in a fight with, you, me. If the state trooper put it all together, Trent, you'd be in jail. Look, they got descriptions of both of us, all right? My car. We're screwed. So what should we do? I don't know. Well, we could split up. Oh, but then one of us could go to the cops. And, Trent, you know how convincing I can be. Stick together, I think it would be better if we had the same story. You'd be more convincing if you weren't looking at my breasts when you said that. Don't be embarrassed. I'd never let the cops take me. But you know what I think? I think you and I were meant to find each other. My parents are going to go ballistic. Oh, look, it's Trent on "America's Most Wanted." [PHONE RINGING] Cops don't work that fast. Hello? MOM: Trent, I was worried. Hi, Mom. MYRA: You were supposed to have checked in 15 minutes ago. I'm sorry. I'm running a little bit behind. MOM: Is anything wrong? No, Mom, everything's fine. MYRA: Well, going to college out of state, I just worry about you. You're my only child. I'll put your father on. DAD: Trent? Hey, Dad. DAD: What's the odometer read. 176 miles. DAD: You're barely passed Hawkinsville. I know. I know. I'm running a little bit late. MOM: No speeding. DAD: Now, if you get sleepy. Calisthenics, I know. DAD: Planning on your ETA of 6:30 PM, turkey, trimmings, the whole nine yards. It will be ready then. Bye. [LAUGHTER] No speeding! I bet you never lie to your parents. Look, my parents are a little overprotective. That's all. Truth is, they embarrass you. Listen, I really don't think about it, all right? Oh, yes, you do. In the back of your head, there's a little voice. You're just not listening. How would you know? I used to not listen either. Now I do. To voices in your head? Maybe you're a little crazy. -Yeah. Maybe I'm a lot crazy. [HONKING] Jesus! Sorry, I dozed off! Sue me! [KNOCKING] At least it's not Sylvester the Cat. [KNOCKING] It's Roy. [KNOCKING] Crazy bastard is trying to run us off the road! [KNOCKING] Pull over! No, we end this here, little present from Tom. I can lose him. Last night, I postponed the outcome. This ends here! What are you doing? [GUNSHOTS] -Shit! -That's it! I can lose him! Get the holster behind your chair! It's got more ammo! We can get away! Give it to me! We can lose him! -Like hell we can. -What are you doing? Terminating the relationship. Closer! I'm trying! I can't believe I'm doing this. I can't believe I'm doing this! [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GRUNTING] Get out of here! [GRUNTING] Go to hell, Daddy! No, Roy, no more! You just stay away from me! No more! No more! Please, Roy! No, please! No! Daddy's little baby looks short. Please, Daddy. Daddy, no more! Trent, get out of here! How can a father do that to his own daughter? Come on up and see. Get a ringside seat. Get on your knees. Get on your knees. [SOBBING] Let's see what all those zippers taught you. Open up my pants. Go ahead! Go ahead, take my pants down. [CRYING] Take them down. Look! Look at me! Look at me! Don't-- [SOBBING] Don't turn away from Daddy. Look at me! Don't turn away, I said! Don't turn away! [SOBBING] Baby wouldn't hurt Daddy. Miya, Miya, no. She wouldn't hurt me. Miya, no. Don't worry about a thing. Miya, no. Nah, nah, baby, you wouldn't hurt your daddy, would you? Put it down. That's right, honey. Put it down. [GUNSHOT] [SCREAMING] Oh, Jesus, oh, God! Oh Jesus! Oh my God! I didn't want you to take your balls to hell! [SCREAMING] Shut up! -We should have called the cops! -No! The cops can't handle this! [GROANING] It was him or it was me! And I won! And he lost! I handled it! Remember that. Because all parents rape their kids! Not mine. My dad screwed me here. Your parents fuck you here. The difference is I knew I was being fucked, and it was over in a minute! [WHIMPERING] [LAUGHTER] [DIALING] POLICE: Main dispatch, highway patrol. Something happened. I don't know what to do. POLICE: Tell us where you are. You have to know it was an accident. POLICE: We need your location. She has lots of problems and-- POLICE: Tell us where you are. Oh. I think we should go to the cops. No cops. Look, if we tell them what happened-- It's not an option. Then I let you out at the next town. Stay with me, Trent. I you do, I could be real good for you. Turn me away, I don't take rejection very well. Look, I've got a real future ahead of me. I'm not throwing my life away. Pick him up. You can pick up guys after I drop you off. Oh, I forgot. Don't pick up hitchhikers, right? Pick him up. -Look, do me a favor. Keep your legs closed until we get to the next town, huh? Funny, you used to like them open. You going to New York? I'll go as far as you want, maybe even farther. This isn't a mirage, is it? Well, why don't you touch me and find out. Woo-hoo! Name's Pez. Pez. His name is Pez. Hey man, since you're sharing this fine ass, least I can do is offer you a hit, aye? Oh, no, no, Trent's queer. Can you imagine? But I see you don't have that problem. [LAUGHTER] Hey, not yet, there's no hurry. As long as I get it, huh? Whoo! -What kind of bull-- -Shh. Patience, it'll come. Give me some of that. Driver, turn on some music! [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh yeah, look at these beauties, huh? [MUSIC PLAYING] Look at these things! These are God's gift to mankind! [MUSIC PLAYING] End of the road, Pez. The fuck it is. The fuck it isn't. You two are really fucking sick! Hey, you're lucky you weren't killed. Faggot! I never had a man fight for me. It was no big deal. I just threw some guy out of the car. I don't even know what I'm doing anymore. I do. You're taking control. [SIRENS] Some accident. Looks like our robber forgot to take the money again. Definitely got the jewels though. Let's go. RADIO: Susan Taylor on the KBA news chopper. There's an update on a report on west Interstate 80. That's right, Susan, what was first though a traffic accident, the State Highway Patrol now reports it appears to be a homicide. A light blue semi truck was found abandoned just off the interstate where a male, late fifties, was found fatally wounded. No motive has yet been established. Oh, God. We're going to get spotted, all right? We need to pull over somewhere so I can think. Yeah, let's pull over somewhere. Whoa! Look at this place. This is some barn, huh? When I was a kid, I had this Aunt Trudy. And one summer, my dad dumped me off on her farm. And she had this really, really, really big barn in the back, and all these pigs. And it smelled really funny. We used to play with all these chickens, and play in the hay. She was great. She really loved me. That was the only time it ever stopped. Hey, Trent, look, there's a swing. Come on. Give me a push. [LAUGHTER] Mr. Sourpuss? You're not going to pout all day about being an accessory to murder, are you? Twist me around so I can get really, really, really dizzy. Yeah. [LAUGHTER] [MUSIC PLAYING] TRENT: Hey, Dad? Son, you're in the home stretch. We can't wait to see you. TRENT: Yeah, me too. Um, there's someone I didn't tell you about, a friend. She's a-- she's a freshman. And I met her at the University. And I was hoping she could join us for dinner. DAD: Sure, what's her name? [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh! [MUSIC PLAYING] Now, this won't hurt. Ah! Maybe a little. Do his nose, James. -What? -Shh. [GROANING] Come on, Trent. Don't be such a baby. You almost done? Anything worth having comes with a little pain. [GROANING] [LAUGHTER] You deserve a reward. How about my reward being a movie theater? Yeah? [LAUGHTER] [PANTING] Wow, oh, thank you. Thank you. I've never had a family Thanksgiving before. Thank you, Trent. Why are you looking at me like that? Well, think you're finally ready to stand up against parents? Look, everything isn't about control. No, everything is about control. When a John hires me, he thinks he's buying control. But, no, he's only fooling himself, because I hold the cards. I say what happens, when it happens, and when he gets off. Everybody takes part, Trent, everybody. Listen to me, kids, they cage their pets. Parents try to mold their kids. Wives wait on their husbands. Husbands submit to their bosses. It never ends, right up to the grave, when some heir chooses the cheapest fucking casket so he can spend more money on himself. So you think you can just blow into your parents' house, the new haircut, new earring, new clothes, and all of a sudden they're going to relinquish all their control? No. [PHONE RINGING] Hey, can you feel the leash pulling? [PHONE RINGING] Come on. What's the matter, still hungry? Yeah, go ahead? RADIO: I just got a report on the same make and model seen parked outside 456 Main, the Main Street Grill. -Copy. Let's go. -You got it. [SIRENS] Freeze! Freeze this! [SIRENS] They're still following us! Cops have a tendency to do that, Trent! [SIRENS] You can't outrun us, Trent. So pull over. We don't want to use force. [SIRENS] We're going to end up like that education movie "Red Asphalt." Shut up and keep driving. [GUNSHOT] Oh, God. She's firing at us. We're gonna die. [GUNSHOT] Keep back until we're out of the residential area. Whoo! Go on, Trent! Drive! I'm trying, all right? Well, I can't shoot and drive at the same time! Oh, shit! Keep a little closer. I got a bad feeling about this. -Just hang in there. -Drive! I'm going! I'm going! Shit! [GUNSHOT] Whoo! You're sick. -Drive! -I'm trying! I'm going! Jesus! I'm hit. We got him! [SIRENS] Jesus, I don't believe the bitch shot me. Just hold on. I'm coming around. Check? Check? She's got a 9 millimeter. She's a killer. She hates men. Don't take any chances. Just follow my lead. I want the parents and the son to get out alive. You got it? Go around this side. Go around the back. You come with me. Let's go. Look, we-- we just can't keep running, all right? -From the police? -Yes! You've got to get them out of your mind, Trent. It's Thanksgiving, a real family Thanksgiving. Don't let the police spoil it. No, the running you've got to stop is from your parents. It's your threshold. I've crossed mine. Now it's time for you to cross yours. Can I get one? [COUGHING] Well, Mom and Dad will be based because we're on time. Relax. It's Thanksgiving. And everything is going to be just fine. What if I can't do it? I'll be with you. Take control. Take control of what, though? Everything, Trent, everything. [DOORBELL] There they are. Hi. Whoo, without any underwear on, this fall wind goes right through me. What are we thinking of? Come on in. Come on in. So, how was your trip? Guys, this is Suzie. So you must be Trent's schoolmate. Yeah, psychology major. Um, Suzie, this is my mom. Mrs. Colbert, let me guess, anal retentive? Dad. Well. Woo, tongue even, I didn't expect such a warm greeting. Huh, golly. So, parents, what do you think about Trent's new look? Trent, that's-- that's something. Why don't we go into the living room, maybe get a drink? I know I could use one. Parched. Trent, if you could come help me, it would be great, thanks. I'll, uh, just go check on the turkey. Oh no, no, why don't you come talk to me, woman to woman? Come on. What's your, uh-- what's your choice there, Suzie? Surprise me. There's-- there's something that-- I already know. Know what? I've got a goddamn SWAT team upstairs. Now, your job is to separate her from us and get her out in the backyard alone. -I-- I can't. -You can. And you will. Would you like that on the rocks? Straight up. Are the cops here in the house already? Or are they on their way? I don't know what you're talking about. Is she joking? You're a worse liar than your son, better kisser though. What are they going to do to her? Not miss, I hope. So have you known Trent long? Long enough. Aren't you even interested in hearing my side of what happened? No, I'm not. I'm interested in getting you out of this mess. Now, look, I know she's got your head messed up. And I can see how. But you have got to think straight, Trent. You understand, son? Think clearly. Bring the dip. There, sit over there with your mom. Well, that is an interesting outfit? Did that hurt? Nope. She's in the living room with the family. So, Trent was just suggesting that maybe he'd like to take Suzie for a walk, show her our property? I think he'd like it. Unless it's too cold. Well, take my jacket. No. Move in. We could have sat down at the table and ate together. And you could have told me about Trent growing up. No! [GUNSHOTS] [SCREAMING] -Go. -Myra, behind you! [GUNSHOTS] [SCREAMING] Please don't hurt him! Please don't shoot him! Nothing ever changes, Trent! Nothing! We're still being screwed! She's taken a hostage. Get over here, Trent. [GUNSHOTS] Come over here! Take the gun. Take the gun, Trent. I can't do it for you. But I will do it! I'll blow his head off if I have to! Come on. Just take the gun, Trent. I can't do it for you! Look at you. Your father's dead. And look what you're doing to yourself. He will never be dead, Trent, not to me. Put the gun down! [GUNSHOTS] -Look, stop it! Stop it! Put the gun down, and move away from it. Myra, you said you wouldn't hurt him. Please don't hurt him. You said you wouldn't-- Shut up! You're so close, Trent. Take control. If we surrender, they'll help us. I'd rather die strong than live weak! I swear to god, I'll kill him! I swear! No, please! See? See? Can't you feel it? Huh? Trent? Inside, and outside, everywhere, everything, Trent, all the sensations, all the sounds, all the smells, everything. I've been there, Trent. I know. I know. OK? And you don't have to be scared. So just do it. Both of them. Both of them? We surrender! No! No! No! No! [GUNSHOT] It will be all right. No, it won't. We can get through this together. It will never be the same. [MUSIC PLAYING]
