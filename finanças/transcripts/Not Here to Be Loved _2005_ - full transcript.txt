Who is it? Mr. Delsart, bailiff. - Are you Mrs. Rose Diakite? - Yes. Open the door, please. Did Francis send you? - Does he want to come back? - No, not at all. The court has ordered you to pay the sum of... EUR 3,292.90, which is what you owe in unpaid rent. Here's a copy of the ruling. But I can't... I can't pay. You'll have to find a solution. The court has made its decision. Don't blame me. It's way too much! What am I supposed to do? I have a job. I don't depend on anyone. But I can't... And my boyfriend's not here, so... I see, but look... You have some time to pay up. But you need to find a solution. Good-bye, Mrs. Diakite. NOT HERE TO BE LOVED Jean-Yves, cheers! Welcome aboard. Thanks. - Peanuts? - Thanks. - Raring to go? - Sure. Luckily. We're swamped. I'm greatly relieved to have you around. What was I telling you? It never ends. - Ready? - Yes, I am. I recently got a card from Mother. Maybe she'll come to France in a few months. When she arrives, I'll try to avoid her. - Do you like your apartment? - It's fine. It's not very big, but it's sunny. That's important for my plants. Some had to go in the bathroom. But other than that... I found a place for all of them. Let me show you your office. You should talk to H?l?ne. She'll explain how we work here. The files, etc. I'll be off, my work awaits me. See you later. Mr. Delsart? I meant to say... Your father is being difficult again. He reduced one of our girls to tears. If he could be more respectful, we'd appreciate it. - I'll talk to him. - Thank you. I'll put a house on it. 14,000... How'd you spend the week? Guess! Playing basketball? How are things with the nurses? As if they care about me! - No problems, then? - Are you going to play or talk? They're not the same. Yes, they are. What's wrong? They're not! - They taste bad? - That's not the point. They're different, period. So stop treating me like an idiot, OK? As if you don't know! They ran out of the 80%, so I got the closest. - How come they ran out? - I don't know. They had 72% cocoa. Take them back, I don't want them. Buying me some chocolate shouldn't be a problem. Go on, play. I've had enough, dammit! You come see me once a week, I ask you a simple favor, but you can't even do that. Is it so difficult to buy some chocolate? Fact is, I can't trust you. That's nothing new. Always the same old story... I'm so pissed off! - Care to go for a walk? - No. The lounge, then? To talk to senile old fogies? I'm going to bed! - I'll go so you can sleep, then. - That's right, get lost! You got what you wanted! You piss me off! You piss me off! You piss me off! - How old are you? - Fifty. Almost 51. Your blood pressure's fine. And your heart tests are good, but there may be a slight coronary insufficiency. You're not getting any younger. I'll prescribe you some trinitrin, but only if you feel an attack coming on. You'll have to be careful. Eat less fat, for one thing. Drink less, exercise... Do you practice a sport? Plenty of tennis when I was younger, but... That was a long time ago. Tennis is definitely out. Unless you want a heart attack. I don't know... Cycling will do you good. Swimming too. No, not swimming. Because of the chlorine. Whatever you prefer, but... You have to keep physically active. Or one day, your heart just says "Stop." Good-bye, then. It was a real pleasure. I really enjoyed it. I certainly look forward to next week. Next week, I'll be coming with my fianc?. See you next week. Excuse me... I've been staring at you all night... I think I know you. Really? - Jean-Claude, right? - Yes. - Jean-Claude Delsart? - Indeed. - Don't you recognize me? - No. Fran?oise Rubion. Doesn't ring a bell. Your mom was my nanny, remember? Fanfan... Fanfan, of course. Now that you mention it, I do remember. Fran?oise Rubion, right? Mrs. Rubion's daughter. Hi there... Get lots of work done? No, I couldn't. It's crap. Total crap. No, you always say that. Show me what you wrote. Why? I got nowhere. Hungry? No, my gut's in a knot. Simenon could write a novel in two weeks. I'm getting nowhere after seven months. Simenon was Simenon and you are you. Authors write at their own pace. Stop working yourself up. But the days are passing by, the school year coming to an end and I'm nowhere near finished. I can't face those kids in class if I haven't written my book, it's too important. I know you can do it. Your book will be great. I promise. But stop stressing yourself out. Won't you ask me how my first tango lesson went? Sure, how did it go? It's not easy. The instructor makes it look so simple, then you try and it's really hard. But it's great fun. We're all having a good time. Next time, you're coming. No backing out again, OK? Yeah, but I'm not making any progress, and I can't do two things at once. Fine, but the wedding's not far off. You can't afford to miss too many lessons. I want us to look good for the first dance. Your book's going to be great, I know it. - Right! - No, I know it. Michel! Basket! Mr. Lemel was out, so I left him a written notice. Same goes for Ranc. Mr. Lef?bvre was in, so I gave him the court order. As for Saramito, you know... It's like pissing in the wind... - Is he a nutcase! - Maybe he's slightly deranged. Mr. Noblanc called. He'll call back. Screw him! Tell him I'm out, OK? And hold all calls for the rest of the day. I have a zillion things to do. Good evening. Where's your fianc?? Pardon me? Last time, as you were leaving, you said your fianc? would be here tonight. Actually, he was tied up. He'll be here next week for sure. We need to practice for our wedding. But let's dance together later. I'm counting on you. She's OK, but he can't lead. So what was good and what wasn't? What's good is that you listen to the music. What's not so good, Laurent, is you don't lead Christine enough. She's left on her own. Remember that next time. Who wants to go next? Fran?oise? How about you? Who would you like to dance with? I don't know... - Jean-Claude. - Very well. Take up your positions. Jean-Claude, remember to listen to your partner. I missed my bus. The next one's in a half-hour. Can I have a lift? - Of course, get in. - That's sweet of you. Please excuse the mess. No, it's fine. That's my school. Really? What do you teach? Actually, I'm a guidance counselor. What do you do? I took over the family firm. I'm a bailiff. Across from the tango school. Very pretty. - How does it feel? - Great. Except it's a bit long. - Can you take it up? - Of course. Lace would suit you. No, it's fine like this. A wedding dress needs lace, volume... And speaking of volume, you need an underskirt. No way, not an underskirt. It'll give me a big butt. Your sis looked great in hers. She had volume. Agn?s is Agn?s and I'm me. It's my wedding, I choose the dress I like. And I like it. It's exactly what I wanted. I'm not too late, am I? That's pretty. You look beautiful. Mother wants more lace. - Why bother with lace? - To give it volume. No, leave it, it's much better. - Really? - Sure, of course. I wanted to see you, we have to talk. I've been thinking it over... Don't take it personally, but I've decided I won't be staying with the firm. I hate it, I don't wanna be a bailiff. To be honest, I freakin' hate it. Say whatever you like, I don't care. I really hate it. Sorry, my mind's made up. Where's the repossession order? In the file underneath. Good, thanks. You can go. I think we need to talk. Go on. Well, actually... Since I joined the firm... I've been thinking... Being here and all that. And I've decided... This isn't against you, it's not aimed at you, but I... but I... It's a bit... It's my own personal... Although... I was wondering if... Spit it out. What's the problem? There's no problem... Ask her to hold. What? I was wondering if... Can I put some plants in my office? Yeah, sure. Don't invade our space, that's all. Come on, off you go. It's about my tango shoes. I think I left them in your car. I'll take a look. Whatever works for you. Either you come here or I come over there... I'll come there, I have time. Early evening? Seven o'clock? - Am I too early? - No, I just got in. Go on through, please. I was wondering about something... Isn't your job tough? Going to people's houses demanding money. No, it's all about... ...contact. - Enjoying the dance lessons? - They're OK. I suck at it. - No! - I do. You don't suck at all. I'm not good either. You're too hard on yourself, you're really good. - Honestly? - Sure. I have a problem with el ocho, the back el ocho. Let's see... Peso, peso, peso and back, feet together, to the side, center, leg... - That's where I screw up. - Not that leg, the other one. Watch. Peso, peso, peso, back, center, to the side, feet together and then this leg forward. Hold on. Peso, peso, peso, OK... Back, center, to the side and leg... - Not that one, this one! - This one, right. That makes... ...peso, peso, peso, back, center, to the side, feet together. - And then this one forward. - All right. Ready? Three, four... Back, center, to the side and forward. That's where I get in a tangle. You have to shift your weight to move the other leg forward. Hold on... Weight. And leg. That's right. Now I pivot? Try again. OK, I've got it now. The leg... Thanks for the drink and the shoes. My pleasure. - I told you we'd be cold. - But it's good to get out. If you want me to catch my death, don't bother coming. You have a sweater and a coat, you won't catch cold! At least your brother and sister don't try to pretend. They never visit. They don't, but I do, so stop sniveling, OK? I was thinking... Remember all the cups I won when I played tennis? Know where they are? - Why do you ask? - Just wondering where they were. Rubbish like that probably got thrown out. You threw them out? All those cups I won? - You could've said so. - What'd you expect? They were gathering dust. Still... You could've mentioned it. Didn't you figure I'd retrieve them one day? What for? That's kids' stuff. I won them, they're my cups. They're mine. You throw out the big one I won at the regional championships? Along with all the others. Damn! Why scream at me to win if you were going to throw them out? Really! I'm going back, I'm freezing my ass off here. I don't give a shit! You're pissing me off! She hasn't paid her rent for eight months. A court order was issued for her to pay or face seizure. Of course these people are in deep shit! Don't think, just enforce the law. You're not the Good Samaritan! Why didn't you slip the order under her door? Her neighbors were insulting me. So let them insult you! Who cares? It's water off a duck's back. Act like you're deaf. Lose the plants, this ain't a nursery. You always find an excuse not to come. I had a huge wave of inspiration in the late afternoon. I can't stop now, it'd be a waste. You always have a reason. One thing, then another thing... You won't be able to tango at our marriage. Gimme a break. You're going to see a show. It doesn't really matter, you'll teach me, it can't be too hard. Go and write, then! You don't get it! Isn't Fran?oise coming tonight? She's supposed to be. Isn't she here yet? Doesn't look like it. - How are you? - Fine. How would you like to go for a drink after the show? I'll have to head home, it'll be too late. - The show won't finish late. - We'll see. - I'm counting on you. - OK, we'll see. I love your car. It's very pleasant. It's a foreign car. Actually... I planned to buy French, but ended up buying foreign. I see. Good-bye, then. - See you soon. - Yes. - It's me. - Hi! I'm making headway. I found a great twist to get the plot rolling. - Can I help you? - Yes, hello. I'd like to buy some perfume. For yourself or as a gift? - A gift. - Very well. For a younger or a more mature woman? Not too mature. Under 40. What kind of perfume do you have in mind? Don't you have anything... I don't know... Something a little lighter. Perhaps a little more citrus. I like that a lot. It's Intense Passion. Intense Passion? Would you have the same scent with another name? Desert Rose is closest to it. OK, Desert Rose will do. - Gift-wrapped? - Please. You're making a big mistake. Don't mix everything up. I once fell for a guy at the gym. - I even had an affair with him. - You had an affair? Why not? Marriage isn't the end of desire. - Philippe knows? - No! I don't want to give it all up. Philippe, the kids, the house... You move on. How old is this guy? - In his fifties. - Of course. A sweet talker... Divorced, right? He uses women. A checkout girl, fine, but not you! He's not at all like that. That's not his style. What is his style, then? I don't know. Normal. Really? You're going to ditch Thierry for a guy who's normal? Does he love you? Has he given you a present? See? Then stop dreaming. Besides, nothing happened between you. Something about this escapes me. Mom would be terribly hurt if you called it off. She'd loathe you and never recover. I'm saying it for your sake. You can't see Jean-Claude again. He'll use you then he'll leave you all alone. When you're 20, fine, but you're no longer 20. Look at me. Promise me never to go to another tango lesson, and never to see this Jean-Claude again. Think of Mom. OK. Excuse me. How are you? All ready for the wedding? Didn't you tell me you were getting married? That's right. Will it be a civil or religious ceremony? At church. Open up! Jean-Claude, we have to talk. I need to explain, Jean-Claude! Why are you looking at me that way? No reason. Actually, I just wanted to say I love you. And I'm sorry if I'm a bit edgy about my book, but all that counts for me is you. You becoming my wife. That's what really matters. I'm very happy. My little princess. How'd it go today? Fine. - Did you see Mr. Gauthier? - Indeed. What did he say? He wasn't very happy. - Did he yell at you? - A little. No big deal, I ignored him. Someone to see you. Who is it? Show the person in. Thank you. I owe you an explanation. The other day, you didn't give me time to explain. To tell you the truth, yes, I am getting married. I'm to blame. I should've told you. I don't know, I mean... I didn't, true enough. So if you figured that something... That there could be something between us and if I hurt you, I apologize. But someone said when you're getting married, you can be mixed up and you... These things happen, you see? Still, that's no reason... ...to erase the rest. I don't want to. I didn't want you to think I'd led you on or was playing games. I'd be crushed if I hurt you. I'm very fond of you and I love dancing with you. We can still tango if you like. We can stay friends. I don't think so. I don't really want to be your "friend." You've had your fun, you've made... ...a right idiot of me, so what I would really like is to never see you again. That's all. - Didn't you forget something? - What? - I'm on your property. - Sorry. Rue de Paradis... 6,000. That's my token. Sorry. Are you playing or not? If you're going to play like this, there's no point coming. You haven't uttered a word since you got here. If you weren't here, it wouldn't make any difference. Now you're really pissing me off! It's the same every weekend. I come visit, but you whine. I'll be off! Do the others visit? Do they play Monopoly with you? No, but like an idiot, I come back every Sunday! It's too hot, too cold... You're never happy. Never a kind word! You piss everybody off! First my mother, then my brother and sister, now me! And everybody here! And those cups I won playing tennis... Why'd you throw them out? You never gave a shit about me. Too busy complaining. Backhand, serve, forehand... I'd have cracked you over the head you with my racket if... Guess what? I'm going. You won't see me again. Now you'll spend your weekends alone, you sap! Mrs. Rose Diakite? Can you open the door, please? It's Mr. Delsart. By virtue of the powers vested in me by law, and following various orders you have chosen to ignore, I am here to seize your furniture and request that you vacate the premises thereafter. Excuse me... Can you two dorks stop giggling? Thank you. Go on, get out. Get out, I said. Don't waste your life in this shitty business, like I did. But I'm filing the photocopies. Do me a favor, scram. Time to cut the crap. You'll be better off tending your plants. Come on! I'll go, then. Michel, come to Mommy! I'm off, Mr. Delsart. - See you tomorrow. - Good-bye. It's none of my business, but I wanted to say... The lady who came here the other day said some things... She wasn't at all sincere. How do you know what she said? You eavesdrop? Actually, I do at times. I must say... The day I told a man more or less what she told you, I wish someone had been eavesdropping. I wouldn't be alone with my dog. You can't always be a fool. There, that's all. Good night, Mr. Delsart. - Turn it down, kids. - We can't hear it. Turn it down or I'll just switch it off. - Thanks for your help. - Leave 'em alone, they're OK. Easy for you to say. Cut it out. Now, then... Based on what we agreed... Thierry, can I have a sweetener? We'll have tables of eight. Thanks, that's kind of you. So... Here's the head table, with you two, Agn?s, Philippe, Thierry's parents, me and Granny. Here, the Dusseaus, the Taugourdeaus and the Chopins, since they all get along. There, Claudine and her husband, the Veillard kids and their partners. Except... Claudine and her husband will be bored there. Why? They have absolutely nothing in common with the Veillards. - So where do I put them, then? - Somewhere else. It's all set. I'm not changing it around now. Just find two other guests to sit with the Veillards. Who? - Michel and Lucienne? - They don't know them! But Claudine and her husband know the Veillard kids, even if they don't like them. That was a bad idea! I spent two days working on the seating arrangements. Don't worry, it's only for the meal. - No one asked you to do it, Mom. - Now it's done. I figured it'd make you happy, now you're all against me. No, we're not, we're discussing it. What's wrong? Are you OK? What is it, honey? You can tell me. Come on, Fanfan, what's wrong? Is something the matter? What's eating her? You've no idea how long she's waited for this moment. Yes, I'll take it. Yes, speaking.
