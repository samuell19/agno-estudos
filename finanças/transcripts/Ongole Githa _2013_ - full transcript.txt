Do you know who rules over this yard? Adhikesavulu sir! He's the chairman of this yard. - Look at sir, how simple he is! Sit silently, sir hates praise.

Sir, please give me a handful of rice. l've already eaten it, no sir. - Please give me, sir. That's it. Very good. - Thank God! l've arranged free meals, came to test if food is good or not.

Okay, do as you wish. Give me the bottle! Give me! You know l wouldn't spare anyone if l lose money.

The fight will result in heavy loss to exporters. People responsible for it would be fined according to market rules, and they would be expelled from market yard. Why are you beating our men? - Look at them, brother. No...no...they'll expel us from market. Always picks up fights right from his childhood days. He feels he owns the market. Feeling? The market is mine. Did you see how proud he is! cancel license, send out.- Okay. What else then, brother? ls it wrong to think the market we work as ours? Business is being done on highway instead of market, how much market is losing because of it? Traders like me and farmers too are losing heavily. When l questioned them, he sent his men to beat me. lf you don't interfere, it may give bad name to you only. That's why l beat them. - Yes sir, what White did is right! White fights but not unnecessarily. - Stop! What he says is right! How important l'm for getting good name to this market, we need another man to protect, that is also very important, that's White! Sir! - What you did was right! Hereafter the market is your responsibility. Come. How hot and fiery red chillies are, so is the young man's heart... l'll ensure no business deal slips away... Would anyone dare challenge me? Chilly market is livelihood, honesty is our tradition.. Hail Seetha Rama! Though there's burden on our hearts, we'll carry any load easily... l'll make the wind blow this side... l'll make you say l'm the best here... This market is my birthplace...

We'll be happy, right? How much would you give? l spent this much to become an MLA. - Rs.100 crores! Let's get it shifted. There is problem...Adhikesavulu!

Market will be shifted to this place. Greetings...greetings... Your arrangements are rocking! You promised to come with your family. - They're coming. How much time will you take madam? We've to go quickly for shop opening ceremony. Shouldn't l offer incense? Tell her to start first, don't know how many more circumambulations she'll do? Madam, how long will you go around it? At least you come, madam. We're getting late. Should l find ifjunior madam has finished taking bath or not? Madam Sandhya! Have you finished taking bath? Come quickly, we're getting late, madam. Today is Sunday! Not a drop of water should fall on Sandy! l don't hear the sound of water. Wait...shouldn't l finish my bath? Thank God, she has started taking bath! Madam, please come out quickly. Would anyone take bath on Sunday? You didn't take bath, did you? - You know it! No...- lt's important to be neat not clean, grandma! Dirty girl! - l'm not dirty girl! Sandhya, get ready quickly. My name isn't Sandhya, it's Sandy. - What's that name, madam? ln near future l'm going to marry and settle down in America, right? lf not as Sandy, should l be called like old film heroine? Nothing short this, don't you've the sense of taking bath before attending a function? Who is that fool to inaugurate the shop on Sunday? White, you're wanted there. lsn't she has grown up? l'll be back in a second. Dirty girl! - Shut up. Grandma, welcome. Madam, what's madam's name? That's it. Get cool drinks for them. Why did you come so late, sister? Who is he? Why is he overacting? He owns the shop that is to be inaugurated. Didn't you find any day other than Sunday to open? Your father selected the day. - Come. l'll not come. l'll sit here. What's this? This side, sir. Mother! - What? - Come here. Grandma, please wait a moment. Grandma, you're lighting the lamp in every shop, she's like Goddess Mahalakshmi, why not ask her to do it? No please, you don't know about her. lf you want, l'll... - Grandma! Give a chance to youth. No, please listen to me. Please come. He doesn't know it, please don't ruin his life. He's calling me, what bothers you? Please listen to me. - Sit tight here. Please come. He's digging his own ditch, what can l do? You've taken the right way to capture the market, White! He's dead! Let him go to hell! Madam, please smile! lsn't it funny? What happened? - Look there! Thanks to Adhikesavulu and his daughter Sandhya for inaugurating my shop... Sandy baby! Do you've sense? Because my father told me, l came on Sunday to open your shop, would you take my photo and put up a banner near my college? Not just here, l've put up banners in 18 places all over the town. 18 centres? Have you dishonored me everywhere? Couldn't you at least put a good photo of mine? What's this nasty photo with a nastier write up? Criticize anything but not the write up. He had drinks and took an entire night to come with it. Look, how he's feeling bad! lsn't it? - Didn't you like it, baby? Next time, l'll have a half bottle and rock it. Next time smile in the photo, l'll rock it. Are you mad? - Keep this. What's this? For lighting the lamp?- No! What should've been sold in 6 weeks got sold off in 6 hours, believe me! lt's the magic of this hand. Give it to me. l'll start my business with this 1000 note, even if l fall short of Rs.1 lakh by one rupee, l'll not meet you tomorrow. Would he earn it? Why don't you decide it? l'm promising 10% for shifting the market. l'm making it 20% but you haven't yet agreed. Okay, have a drink, foreign wine, my son sent it. What are you looking at? - Don't you know he doesn't drink? l know, tell him to shift the market. Whatever you may tell, market yard will not be shifted. Look, don't refuse the deal that has come to you. lf you don't listen, you'll stay in this seat for a week only. A new man will take charge, l'll appoint him as an MLA, l'll change you! What will you do then? What will you do? MLA is threatening our chairman with dismissal for refusing to shift market. We must show our power to him. That's our vehicle! - The vehicle is not insured too. Did you see that? We love this market and sir loves us! lf you do anything with market against his wish, Why did you give it to me? He'll die today, tomorrow we're all ready to die. Tell quickly! lf anyone comes here as chairman instead of sir, we'll burn down you also! Hey put off this! He blew it off. What's your name? - Subbu, sir. Do you've any dream? - No, sir. You must have dreams, l too have a dream. Do you want to hear it? What is our MLA telling us now ...hold this! He says to shift the market from here to there, he's promising to 10 to 20 crores for it. lsn't it wrong sir? - lt's Wrong, right?- Go ahead. What my dream is... lf we shift this 100 acre market to this side, 200 acres around it is mine, land prices will shoot up, my dream's value would be Rs.200 crores. l've such a big dream, why are you refusing to give your 10 acre land in between to ruin it? We thought you were like God, sir. To make you believe it, to protect the image of good name you gave me, since morning when l get up to night when l retire to bed, do you know how difficult it is to act like a good man? l'll tell you, listen! When l leave home to market in the morning, greeting everyone on the way gives my hands terrible pain, when he uses the already used blade to shave, fearing l would get afflicted with AlDS, but still l've to get shaved in market to get good name, eat from the plates of low class people, even if it is nauseating, l've to spit it secretly, l always do a bottoms up with liquor, l've to act with same smile as if l'm a teetotaler. After acting for the entire day when l reach home, l don't get sleep at night, do you know when l get sleep? Stripping out everything... if l tell l'll lose my honour, even after taking so many precautions if anyone comes to know about me, bloody! l've killed so many like this! You've two options. One, give me your land and die, two, l'll kill and take your land. Sir, please leave me. Only God and l should be there in the world to know my true self. Not another soul must be there. - Sir...sir... Now market will shift to the place we want to, What? What are you thinking? ls it about MLA? - No, about White, brother. Neither people nor MLA would be hurdle to our dream but White! lf White is the hurdle, he'll be my next victim. What are you studying baby? - Can you understand if l tell? Why are you going away though l'm calling? Has 1000 become a lakh? Okay, give me a lakh now, you can make it a crore by tomorrow. What a great hand this is! lnstead of giving 1000 or lakh every day, why not l own these hands forever? How nice my life would become? What are you saying? That is... - Cool, White, she's in college, can't she understand this? What's it? Love? She knows it! Come...come... lt may be good for you to tell you love a girl like me. But l can't tell anyone that a boy like you loves me. Why not? What does he lack? lsn't he a man? That's not my problem. l wished to marry a software engineer and settle down in America. Don't ruin my dream. Sandy baby! Don't ruin his dream also. Whichever country it may be, you want to me to earn well, right? l too earn well, l own 4 shops in market. That's it! l hate that market, chillie, dust and this white dress. Understand this, our hands too can't meet to shake hands. Please leave me alone. Okay, go. Go! Can our hands meet at least for this? Go! l didn't expect this mass boy from market to leave me so easily. How could you lose in this business deal? Remember one thing, this is A-1 quality here, can't l clinch this deal? MLA is back again! MLA is here, if we've any problem, our Chairman will discuss... Close the door. We had warned you but still dared to come back again. Let's leave this place immediately. Do you know how hot the market is with chillies? l know...l know it very well. So, after thinking over it again, l've taken a decision.- What is he saying? The candidate to represent you is... He must tell my name, if not market would go up in flames. ...White! Don't go, please listen to me. lt looks like silence before a storm. l thought it was very difficult to buy a man against you, but did you see how easily l got one? Why are you beating them? Are you such a great man to come to my market and change our chairman? Now l've come to your area and telling you, market will not move, it'll stay as it is, you're not enough to take on a good man like Adhikesavulu, to oppose him you need another good man, there's only one man in this world, though he's little costly, buy him! Who is he? Tell me, who is the man who can stand against Adhikesavulu? l'll buy him with crores. Tell me, who he is? l! When l came here as 12 year old boy, they chased me out from market saying l wasn't the size of chillie. l had decided then someday l must rule over this market! Now l got that opportunity. l want your blessings, sir. Look, l've selected White as my candidate for chairmanship, if you and your chairman don't like my selection, l'll go away. Wait...wait... l've served people for 25 years as their chairman, to give opportunity to youth... - l told you, brother. What? - He's the danger man. Experience? One must have experience, how can he do without experience? 6 acre market has grown to 60 acres in my chairmanship, does one need experience or not to look after such a big yard? What's in experience? When you took over as chairman, you too were of White's age only! Well said...did you hear that? l was also of White's age when l became chairman, didn't l get experience? He too will get. He'll also get experience. What would a good chairman like me wish for? He'll wish only good for you! Sir, you told nobody can harm market if White is here. What else do l need? You don't know, l'm sleepless thinking about who would be next chairman, l prayed to Lord Anjaneya, he has shown our chairman, White has all the qualifications to become chairman after me. White is our chairman! Sir, you told nobody can harm market if White is here. What's in experience? When you took over as chairman, you too were of White's age only! l thought it was very difficult to buy a man against you, but did you see how easily l got one? Why are you beating me? Have you gone mad? How dare you make White chairman of this yard? This market is mine. l'll tell you where this market should be shifted, will you pay me paltry 10% commission to me? Do you know this? l kill people too. l thought of killing White, if he dies you'll find another man, l'll kill you. No...no...don't kill me... l beg you. Please spare me. l'll shift market yard to wherever you want it. Please listen to me. You've a daughter and l've a son, let's fix their marriage and become kinsmen. l'll do whatever you order. Please listen to me, don't harm me. You're the first man to go alive from here after seeing my other side. Apply powder. You had announce his name as chairman, you've to announce that he's not the chairman candidate anymore. Apply powder. What l'm trying to tell is high command isn't accepting your candidature, What? l asked them, they say you're very young, they you don't have much experience, do one thing, join my party and grow up little, l'll take care of it later. l guaranty you'd become chairman. You announced him as chairman, when we're asking about his swearing-in ceremony, are you saying he's not our chairman? Are you playing your dirty politics here also? lf you say no to White as chairman, we'll sacrifice lives. Please listen to me. - See sir...- What? See, what's happening here, sir? How injustice is being meted to us, sir? He promised White as chairman but now says no. That's why...the promise you made yesterday... That's why l say politicians are two tongued. lf White is not the chairman, who else is here... Who else other than you! l? Party high command has taken this decision. What can l do? - lt is wrong, l told you, right? Please leave me. Why are you pulling me into it again? No sir... - Look at him, young boy! How many dreams he would've dreamt about becoming chairman? Sir... - l'm telling for an argument. How can you say he's not chairman suddenly. l've seen my days, l can take it easily. How can this poor boy take it? lt is wring. - How can it be wrong? lf l choose another man instead of you, it is wrong. People want you as their chairman, what do you say? That is their affection. - l'm withdrawing, sir. l'm withdrawing. You stop! lf it hurts me so much a day, if he's removed after being chairman for 20 years, would he have slept last night? No, sunny... - l said it for an argument only. Can we say no if sir is our chairman again? That's it, everyone is happy, right? No sunny, please listen to me. - What's there for him to listen? Why no again? He said okay, right? You go. Please... Please go... you please go... Why do you love me so much? - You're God! Sir, one minute! l'm doing business here for the past 10 years, l've never gone home without making a profit, if l go today, this will be the fist day to go home losing. lf l give up this position, it's profit to you, market and everyone here but... So if you put some profit into my account, l'll also be happy. What do you want? Rs.10 lakhs? 10 shops? l'll arrange it. Why do l need shops, dear? - Then? Tell him to fix my marriage with his daughter. Why did you make such a wish? Why are you asking me that, uncle? lf l had made the same wish as chairman 5 minutes earlier, nobody would've found it wrong, do you know whom l've bought? lf you think l'm not qualified to marry his daughter, tell me. l'll withdraw from this too. Sir, White is good and responsible man. Since it is your daughter's issue, your decision is final. You said the groom is from America but now says groom is changed. Who is he? Shouldn't you show him to me? Should l show you? See the cut outs everywhere! lnvitation from fans of White You promised me, right? l'll tell 10 things, 6 lies and 4 truths. Sandy baby, White is like that, you'll understand as time passes. Adhikesavulu, please come here. Sir, please call groom's parents. Priest, l don't have anyone. - No? But l've a father like person. - Then, call him. No sir, till now l thought l was just a business partner, he has made me his father now! Please don't cry, accept it. Calm down, Pavuram. Accept it. You gave up daughter for market, now we're stuck with him. l gave a promise among people, so l got trapped. This marriage will not happen. l want my both my market and my daughter. You wanted market but earned a girl. Will you leave market for a girl? Did you get it like that, uncle? l want both girl and market. But for the present, Father-in-law! l want a group photo. Who is to put a banner for a poem? Sandy within brackets Sandhya, You came to my shop... l fell for you on first sight... You took over me with your beauty... You dragged me into your love... Has he put a banner for this too? Did he? He's dishonouring me in public. lf he has put a banner, he must be somewhere here only.- Hello dear... Girl! Sandy baby! Did you like the poem this time? We put up such a big banner and waiting for your reaction, why are you hiding your face and leaving silently? How can l show? l told you l can't tell anyone that l love a man like you. Should l paint the town red about marrying you now? You planned well and trapped my father, right?- Trapped? Girl, come here. Protect your complexion. You bloody! ls your father any girl to trap him? l'm unlike my father. That's why l like you. Hello son-in-law! Are you here to meet my daughter? Get in, dear. Hey, come here. l'm calling you, get on my bike. - See father! Nothing father-in-law, You arranged the engagement without knowing much about her, l must get to know her before marriage, right? You tell her. He's my son-in-law, please go with him. No problem. Come, you may have plenty of work. Where are you taking her to? To love!

He's not my son. - No? Why are you saying no? Look at him properly again.- Come. Take money and buy a new bottle. He's going away. - Let's go.- Where? Where did he go away? Hey dirty girl, come. lf you call me dirty girl, l'll kill you. Missed him, sir. - We mustn't miss him. Get me the details of devotees who visited temple and offered prayers here. l want their names and from where they were! We didn't find him yet, why is he leaving? Hello, please stop. - Your bag! My boss has no habits but why is he watching films here? We hardly earn anything struggling, entire day amidst hot chillies, look at them they're making millions by applying powder. lt isn't that easy to apply powder and act? lt is very difficult. Only actors know the pain, you watch the film. Why are you surprized? Adhi and l are good friends. Shift the money and market will shift automatically. l can trust you, MLA sir. We're partners. But what about that elderly man? What if he creates trouble? He won't create any trouble, there's a man to silence him. l know how to convince him. l'll take care of it. MLA will make him chairman again by tomorrow morning, work on your project will start immediately.- Automatically. You enjoy the evening happily. Where are you keeping the cash? To keep or steal, there's only one place, cold storage. Keep my share also there only. Rs.100 crores, where else can you get a better place? Sir, it's all over! l mean hero is caught, sir. What would happen next? l'll burn down the market. What? White trading company? l'll shut it down. Pavuram got drunk again. Why are you created such a scene after having little rum? What's your problem? Who am l? - Good trader! Who am l to you? Father like person. Then, who is the man searching you with this photo? My father! The man l didn't want to see in this life, he's that man. My native place is Thikkavarapupalle. Everyone in the village is crazy. But nobody is crazier than my father in the town. Leave me father...leave me... Be careful...slowly! Slow...slow... No problem, come...come... lf you run fast, you may fall down. Take rest and come slowly. That's it. My sweet darling son! My son came last! - My son came first! Did your father raise you like that? Atrocious! There are many more atrocities than this, Pavuram. What are they? Karri Neelakantam beat me only once, but my father beat him many times. He may kill me today! l'll never beat your son again, Bangarraju. Stop...stop... - Please leave me. Let's sit and talk. - That's better, come, let's sit. Tell me. Will you whisper in ears? My ear! The boy climbing tree... that isn't me! That is also not me. This is also not me. This is me! l'll climb father. - No son...no... Please listen to me, get down son. Get down...my dear son, right? Didn't you ask him why is he raising you like that? l asked him strongly. Any father would like his son to win, why are you raising me like this, father? l'll mix water with drink and tell you. l know what my father would tell. My dear, l fear danger to your life. He would say! Bloody life! What is life without a victory? l ran away from home and boarded a lorry, the lorry brought me here, everyone in the market wanted to make money, but a loser like me, l wished to rule over this market. You wanted the market but ended up earning only a girl. Market will come to my hands anyway, but tell me a good idea to flatter the girl. No use of buy teas, tickets and savouries,- Then? You must give something she won't forget. - What's it? Lip to lip kiss! Not to me but to her! Go! - Bend.- Why? l'll climb! l'll climb the wall! ls the gate open? - You climbed the wall unnecessarily. Okay, come. Nobody must see us. Who is it? - White! Grandma! Where is she? l'll also come. Where's the light? She's irresistible! She won't take bath on Sundays! She's fresh today! White, l'm stuck in grandma's hand. Save me! l'm your partner. l'm not your partner, l'm a lover now. You know what would a good lover do now? What would he do? He'll cut the phone call. Why are you so irritated in sleep also? Smile please! This is good. What l gave isn't enough... There's still lot to give... Hey girl, your beauty troubled me all the night... That's why l jumped over the wall... Hey girl, l brought you all my kisses... May l shower it on you? May l on your cheeks... May l on your lips... May l on your waist... May l on your heart... Where shall l plant my kiss? Till now l felt like kissing anyone... Why don't you tell me the place you like me to kiss? Will it be sweet on your lips? ls it warm on your heart? ls it sensational on your waist? ls it cool on cheeks? Are your curves tantalizing? Where's the place l can kiss you passionately? Bloody idiot! Go away! What happened, dear? Why are you shouting? How many times l had complained to you? Did anyone care about it? Do you know what was he trying to do entering my bed room? What did he do? He tried to kiss me. She's lying, grandma. l kissed her. He didn't, grandma. - l did, grandma. No, he didn't, grandma. - Did you or didn't you? l kissed her, Pavuram. Why is she saying l didn't kiss her? Won't anyone believe me? Shall l kiss again? What's this? Father...did you see him? What is he saying? Father-in-law, you had a full bottle, right? You're shaking! We both had half bottle only. He never drinks. Did you see him? How is he talking about you? lf l say anything, he says love. Anyway l... Abuse me l don't mind, if you abuse my love... What's this? Do you know the greatness of my love? What's your greatness? ls it your greatness to come and create trouble at midnight? Yes, it is great! When asked to choose between market and you, l chose you leaving the market, but your father, when given choice between market and daughter, he gave up daughter for market! Would l get scared if you tell your father? lsn't it father-in-law? Won't any man get angry if anyone belittles his love? l got angry, l'm hurt. l'm going away. Be careful, that side. Which brand father-in-law? Secret? Okay! Did you see how he's talking? l don't know how you do it, give him the chairmanship and cancel this engagement. Decide whether you want me or that market. You go, dear. l'll take care of him. Go! Hey elderly man! What's this nonsense? He said you're like father to him, is this the way you raised him? Talk about anything but never about the way l raised him. l'm not like father to him. But he has a father Bangarraju in Thikkavarapupalle, l didn't raise him like that! l raise him properly. How dare you talk about it? l'm also hurt! l got you, boy! That White got engaged with my daughter lying about not having father. What would people in market say if they know he has a father? They'll after just a cheat! Chittoor Vegetable Market - Call from your brother-in-law. How are you? - l'm fine, brother-in-law. Where's he? - Brother-in-law on line. l want a man. - You want him dead. l want him alive. - Give me his address. Bangarraju, Thikkavarapupalle. Hey, come here man! - Are you lame?

You want to meet Bangarraju? - Do you know him? Next to my house. - Where's your house? l'll tell on getting down. l got down, tell me. l didn't mean you getting down, l mean when hangover is down. Tell me! When l drink l forget my house, how can l tell you? What man? Come on guys! He's beating me to make my hangover come down. Move...move... You stop...stop... Already our village has bad name. lf you answer crazily to new people, what would they think about us? Go away! Tell me, what do you want? Where is Bangarraju's house? - He won't. He won't! Even if you shout, he won't. - Are you all mad? Call us crazy we'll bear it, if you call mad, l'll break your back. People of Rayalaseema can have pride, Godavari district people can have sarcasm, shouldn't people of our village be crazy? l'll pay you Rs.1000 if you tell me where's Bangarraju's house? lf you pay Rs.677, l'll tell. This is Rs.1000 note! - l'll tell if you pay Rs.677! That side is Rs.10000 loan, this side is Rs.1 lakh. Mine is Rs.677! - Give me change. Show me where is Bangarraju? l'll not show you Bangarraju. l'll make you hear him! Don't always sing about your son, Bangarraju? Sing something else. Remembering Silk Smitha... My heart is in pain... Drinks in my hand... - Who are you? For drinks? lt is consoling me... Lord Hari...Lord Adhinarayana... A drunkard never lies... Hail Adhikesavulu for getting elected as chairman again. Hail Adhikesavulu! Brother, l came here for his father, l got a man we desperately need. How is the film? - What are you saying? l mean how is the talk? Already l'm irritated with their craziness. Why are you also behaving crazily? How can say film is not good without seeing it? Watch it and then decide. - l'll tell! l remember my son... my heart is in pain... Drink in my hand... lt is consoling me... Sugar cane field is shaking! There's no indication of wind or rain. Sugar cane field is shaking! lt's not yet time to cut canes! ls it ghost there? There's God in me... Lord Anjaneya's blessings are there protect me... l'm not scared... My God is my courage... Who are you? What's your craziness? What's your craziness? - He's my craziness. l've a 20 year old revenge to settle with him. l must kill him. My craziness too is same, 20 year old revenge. On you! He's my enemy! - He's my father! Are you still alive? The life my mother gave is over when you hit me. l owe this life to my father. lt won't go. lt'll take! l didn't come to Ongole for nothing, l'm there on a job. Since my father is an hurdle to my mission, l lived away from him all these years, don't unite us both now. Then, l'll unite you and your father in death! This is not no moon day, Ghost! Why did you come then, madness? Go away ghost... God is here... lf you're in Shakini form... He'll make you furious... lf you're in Dakhini form... He'll cut your nails... lf you're a fiery ghost... He'll cremate you... lf you're a windy ghost... He'll bang your bell... lf you're a bad soul... He'll cure your madness... lf you're a blood sucker... He'll bury you alive... lf you hiss with anger... He'll stamp you out... lf you do any harm... He'll snuff out your life... lf you jump over... He'll chase you out... lf you scare... He'll beat you to death... lf you pick up weapons... He'll kill you... lf you attack from back... He'll drag you out of the field... Son... - Dorababu! Where did you go away for years leaving me alone? My son has come back to me. My son is back. Oh thick sugar cane field! O babe, your concubines are ghosts! You scared me a lot! Shake now! You oomph girl! He's not ordinary man! He's not like me. He's a real man who can create storms in your fields. He's a macho man! Here comes a warrior son... He'll take you head on... He'll show you the power of real anger... He's a raging bull... he's ploughing newly... With your grace, my son has come back to me after years. Hail Lord Shiva! Why are you offering coconuts? You've been found, right? That's why. This is just beginning, there's much more. When l ran away 10 years ago, l thought only my father is sad, but entire village is offering prayers for my return, how am l to repay your affection? Repay your father's loan. Do you think we love you? Unable to know how to get back the loan your father owes us, all of them were dejected, you made the entry at the right time. Did my father take loans? - Took loans? Do you know how much loan he took to raise till you were 10? Do you know the interest on it? Do you know how much loan he took to search since the day you left? Do you know the interest on it? He drank barrels of liquor in the sorrow of missing you. Do you know how much he owes for it? Do you know the interest on it? How could you lend him money without a pawn? You're the pawn. - Am l a pawn? Yes! - Do you know what did he promise me? He said his golden son would come, promising to get my daughter married to you, he took Rs.3 lakhs from me. l gave him Rs.6.5 lakhs. Sit down...sit... Tell me all your principle and interest together, l'll settle it. My Dorababu will marry my daughter. l'm not that great character to settle such a big loan for me. Not for your character but for your complexion. Not a white breed in my entire clan! You're dazzling like a young Ongole bull! lmagine yourself in my family photo! Brother-in-law, fix the marriage date. No need to delay, l'll fix it in 4 days. Shouldn't l've interest in that marriage? We're not bothered about your interest. Get your money with interest that l owe you from him in 4 days. Play the band! Father! Come here, Dorababu! Seek your father-in-law's blessings. Dorababu will stay with me after this marriage. Come, son-in-law! Hold the finger! We may not have colour but we do have character. He has hit on my character. Catch him! Dorababu, run away! Run away...don't get caught. Stop...stop... Leave him, he's innocent. Run away, Dorababu. Son, you run away! Why did you come here? - Are you his son? Had l known you were his son, l would've killed you on day one. Don't accuse without knowing anything. Do you know my father... When you say 10 things 6 are lies and 4 truths, how am l to trust you? l'm telling you only one truth. My father is a good man. Your father is a murderer who killed 32 people. What do you know about my father? - What do you know? l know everything, that's why l entered Ongole. Any father would like his son to win, why are you raising me like this, father? l'll mix water to my drink and tell you. Oh mother! Father! You should've grown well, that man is responsible for this. That Adhikesavulu! Greetings! Move out, Narayana sir is coming! Greetings! Results will be out, l need your blessings, Chennakesavulu. We're thinking of winning this time. victory and defeat isn't in our hands. Narayana has won in the election against Chennakesavulu. Move...move... Says he's not interested. God! This market must always be lively like this. Farmers and traders must prosper. Shower your mercy on all. What does he have which we don't, brother? Goodness. Goodness! Either be born as a good man or must know to act like a good man. l don't have both qualities. Make it a habit. lf not it's very difficult. Never live a life like mine. Hubby! Should he commit suicide for losing? lf he wanted the position, he should've asked me, right? Never do anything silly like that. Stay with me hereafter. Look after market work. Stay here and help them. Okay sir. - Be careful. lt seems l must work with him. l mustn't live like this, father. Junior chairman is coming. Greetings sir. - Greetings sir. Give me a handful. - No sir. No problem, give me. - No sir. l'm asking you, please. How could you eat this food? Brought it from home 4 days ago, can't go home till stock is sold, sir. Where do you sleep? - Somewhere here only, sir. What's this, brother? lt shouldn't happen hereafter. We must build free meal centre and rest house for farmers. No farmer must go back with difficulty and losses. How much it would cost to do that for farmers, sir? You know the revenues of this market, right? You see the accounts, right? lt's a place of business, sir. This business is dependent on farmers. Farmer is not just backbone of this market but to this nation. lt's our responsibility to look after him well. Service to farmer is service to God. This should be the mantra of this market. To achieve this we must expand the market. Brother, come here. - Sir. Look after their needs personally. - Okay sir. Sir, you know about his father... His father may be bad man, why should he be branded like that? Let him work to forget his worries. - Okay sir. Do work. Brother, tea. No need, take it away. Unlike his father and uncle, he seems to be a good man. Clear it. Adhikesavulu, do that. Sir is telling you, clear it. Clear it fully. Chairman is requesting for donations. - Donations? What's going on? Traders are troubling for asking donations.- Move...move... Why should we give money? Why should we give money? Stop...stop... Why should give money? - What's this, Adhikesavulu? Stop...stop... sir... You handed me some work, shortage of funds, so l asked them. They're refusing. lf you need funds, you should've asked me, right? Who told you to collect it from people? No need to panic, there was a small mistake. You don't need top pay anything, l'll pay for it. You asked for money and now you say no need. There's nothing fishy in it, right? What are you saying? l'm asking if accounts are proper or you've tweaked it. Who are you to ask it? Why not? l'm asking for all of us, right? He's not bad enough to seek accounts you're good enough to question him. We know about him. How can he dare question you, sir? l wanted to take on him publicly but not a man trusted me, did you see? But still we mustn't spare him. l'll not spare him. Yes, we mustn't spare him. Let's kill him, brother. We mustn't kill him. - Then? We must kill your father. My father? What the hell are you saying? Unless he dies the market won't come into our hands. lf we've to kill him with goodness, it's in our hands. l'll not spare you. Your father is a crook, my father was a crook. They'll never change, how long should we've to carry their bad reputation? My father is dead, if he too dies, we'll get food assurance, and good future. Will you kill him? There's no way l'll spare... Who hit me?... Hey you... Shall l serve food, son? No, mother. l'm going to upstairs room. Why did you do this injustice to me? What's this? You! You killed my father for asking accounts. What are you saying? Why would l kill your father? lf not who would kill him? Your true colour is out. l'll also ask for accounts, will you kill me also? lf you want check the accounts, get the books.- Okay sir. See the accounts. - l'll not spare you. See! What's this? ls it accounts? - Don't raise alarm. All of you and see. All are tweaked accounts, he killed my father for asking explanation. l'll kill you today, you killed my father unjustly. Move...move... Don't create trouble. Don't create trouble, l'll lose my respect. You come with me, sir. Did you see? - You come with me, sir. Don't create trouble. Come...come. - What's going on here? l'm confused. l didn't kill him. - l'll believe you, sir. They don't have any loyalty, doing anything for them is useless. Listen to me, we don't need this market, give it up. lf we give for raising few questions, who will look after them? Brother... What is he saying, brother? He's refusing to leave the market. One death isn't enough for him. Market is burning down! Come...douse the fire. Come! Nobody is injured, right? Who did this? l know you did this, right? l know you did this. Douse it...douse it... What's happening here? Why did you burn down the market, sir? Water...water...l want water... l didn't do it. l don't know anything. l'm innocent. Trust me. Trust me, l'm innocent. l'm not connected to this incident. Trust me. Will you betray our trust for trusting you like God? You'll be ruined. Hubby, let's go away from here. No...no...don't stay here...go. - You too come with me. No...please. - Listen to me. Hubby! Take him, go from here. Hubby, please come with us. Hubby! - Why are you still here? Go. You too come, let's go away. My husband is getting burnt in fire. Please save him. Come...come....get me water! Brother! - Father and son mustn't be alive. Kill them! Were you behind all this, Adhikesavulu? Was l playing all these days with my death? Were you father and son playing a drama with us till now? l'm coming. Till now l wanted to make you my son-in-law for your complexion, not anymore, l've decide to make you my son-in-law for your character. What a character! l really like you! l like you, son-in-law, you must do two things for me. One, you must tie this dhoti to me in public, two, you must tie the knot with my daughter. till then dhoti will be on my shoulders. Then, you too must do two things for me. What's that? One, my father mustn't know l'm in Ongole, What about the second? He must be with you till my orders. Nobody must know about this. - Would l tell? Generally we don't answer straight to any question. By the way, who is he? He's Mangababu. l thought it was my duty to kill Adhikesavulu for my father, but he sent him here to kill my father. lf we hand over him to market, his true colour would be out, right? He won't get caught so easily. We can hit a bad man straight. But he's a bad man with the mask of a good man. Greetings sir. l did try many times to unmask him. At age of 10, l hit his men as he watched. He didn't come out. l poked my nose into every trouble in market. He didn't come out. When l challenged him to the post of chairmanship, l thought he would hold my collar. Didn't l get experience, he too will get it. He too will get the experience. He didn't come out then too. At last l got myself engaged to his daughter who is his lifeline. Bloody bastard! He didn't show his true colour. He didn't steal the market from my father. His goodness. lt's in his mask. What are you planning to do now? Adhikesavulu, who is acting like a good man in public, l'll show him the hell in acting good man from today. l'll unmask him. Your father is coming! Where's my white breed? Where's he? He ran away. - Ran away. Where did he go away? We told him about son's responsibility for father's problems. He has gone to fulfill it, he'll be back after fulfilling it. lt seems White has father. - No sir, he's an orphan. Am l lying then? - Can l say like that, sir? lt seems White has father. - lt seems White has father. Does White has father? Why don't you answer us? lf he comes to know about your father we both would be dead. Do you really have father, White? Everyone is asking you, do you've father? l do have a father! But though he's there, it's like l don't have. That's why l didn't tell anyone. l always wanted to achieve something in life from childhood. l dreamed of coming good in life. My father crushed y dreams and dumped me in a corner. Unable to bear that hell, ran away from home at 12 and came here. Won't you search if a 12 year old boy runs away from your house? We will search. But do you know what did my father do? My father conducted my last rituals though l'm alive. Would anyone say about a man like him? Whatever it is, a father is father, right? Okay, father-in-law! Since you're saying, l'll forgive my father. Where's my father, father-in-law? Cut! Why are you asking sir about your father? lt seems you sent Durga to bring him here. ls it? ls he telling the truth, sir? Father-in-law, tell him to bring my father quickly. Marriage is nearing, right? l told him...he'll come quickly... You're done, sir. What's this noise? Father-in-law! lt's not festival time too, are you surprized with this festive atmosphere? Anyway you'll celebrate marriage grandly, you'll bring my father, father-in-law, l believe you can do it, you promised marriage but didn't fix a date, when is the marriage, father-in-law? Nothing father-in-law, marriage in our home is a grand affair to people, right? so, l've invited every group that rocks entire state, you decide which beat or rhythm you like. Come, my King...come... Let's go on chariot along with band... Come my king... Le's bring palanquins and complete the marriage rituals... Let's enjoy merry-go-round... Clear off! Father-in-law, next is Adilabad Ravi! O girl, who plays dandia in the parks of my village... Let's marry, tell your father and come to me... You've taken away my heart... You're the flower to adore my home... l'll buy you nose pin an gold waist belt... Your waist is sensuous and your smile is gold... lf you don't like tell me, father-in-law. Next l'll bring Ankampalem dandia troupe. O girl join me gently... lf she says no, how am l to tie the knot with her? Your sins end today... Watch out, l'll take you to task... l'm God of Death to you... l'm the right man for you... l asked you for a marriage song, why are you singing a damaging song? Take him away! Clear off! Uncle Nagulo... You're sleeping on wall getting angry... You're sleeping amidst liquor bottles and glasses... Even after this you're still silent, father-in-law. Don't you like this music or you don't like this marriage itself. l like your music, l like your marriage with my daughter, What are you waiting for then? You've fixed the marriage, why don't you shake a leg too? How will you dance, uncle? Dance and see it yourself... There's Koluru Kolattam dance... Dance to rock the place, uncle... You made Adhikesavulu to dance! You've achieved it. - No. The day my father enters market without covering his face, that would be my real victory. Till then, l'll not spare him. Give his phone to me. Get it. Why is he rushing? Give it to me. Who is he? Your father? ls this Mangababu's phone? No, Nokia! - Where's Mangababu? Anyone can climb if we use a ladder. ls it 9849012399? - l'll check and answer. That's my number, man. l don't know, that's what l see here! What shall l do now? What am l asking and what are you telling me? lf you don't know what you're asking, how can l know what l'm telling? Are you mad? Call me crazy, l'll agree but if you say mad, l'll break your back. Tell me my brother's address, wait there, l'm coming. Wait...l've finished the last cigarette. What to do now? He cut it. He escaped! When l called Mangababu, someone is answering crazily. You go, check it personally. Whatever it may be White's father must be here. Okay brother. Are you driving lorry? - No, watching a film, brother. A hen has run away. - What should l do? He wouldn't have crossed the border, find and bring him back. Wait, please get down, brother. - Why? Get down, brother. - Why? Get down. Why am l meeting only crazy guys? Get down l say! Please walk, brother. Get in, brother. Piece is with me, l'm coming, brother.- Piece? Take it. lf you've any problem, bring it to the notice of chairman. You mustn't fight it out yourselves. Why are you beating him like a beast? Lodge a complaint with chairman. Wait, l'll come. Why are you beating him, White? 100 lorries are entering our market without receipt saying zero business. Rs.1000 per lorry per day for 100 lorries, l mean Rs.365 lakhs which should come to our market, l'm collecting it from them. Moreover they're collecting Rs.10 per bag for lorries with receipt, our market receives more than a lakh of bags, contractors who feed the farmers are taking Rs.25 lakhs, Rs.1000 per shop for keeping a bag in line, they're stealing crores of money that must come to our market, whose money is it anyway? - Who are you to ask me? Husband! Husband to the daughter of this market's chairman. l'll find out who is behind this. ls it you, father-in-law? Did you see father-in-law? How they're looting market under you? Don't worry, father-in-law. l'll unmask the entire network behind this illegal trade. Tell me. Who is behind you? - Nobody is behind us. Then, is he before you? lf he's not behind or before you, l'm sure he's with you. Tell me! What happened, father-in-law? l'm sad for trusting such men. lf you beat and create a scene, it'll hurt me more. That's why father-in-law, to know where all mistakes are going on here, l've called sales, service and income tax authorities, they would've started the raid also. ln cold storage! Sir, there's lot here. There's plenty of cash here, sir. Who owns this cold storage? So much money? ls it cold storage or Swiss bank? Money is there, okay! But why an iron box, mirror, face powder too? Bags of money in sir's cold storage? Who's money is it? - Who said that? Do you think it happened with sir's knowledge? Do you say the money belongs to sir? Look at that face! Father-in-law is God! Tell me, father-in-law, is it your money? No... - Then, whose money is it? May be his. - Who is he? l can't hear it. Who is Durga? My father-in-law's right hand, sir. He too... Never trust anyone. Find Durga. Don't come to cold storage again, father-in-law. Nothing, once a doubt arises, it's difficult to clear it. That's why. They're taking away the money, this tin...l'll take it. Hey idiot! Why are you crying as if you lost your money? Do you think we're kids from Bombay? Bloody... - Are you an MLA? 'lf anything goes wrong, you can't find worse goons than us. You assured market would get shifted. Market must get shifted. You may be MLA or MP here, one call to Bombay and you'd get blown up in a bomb blast. You be happy here, they're torturing me. Answer me. Durga mustn't come back alive. Durga mustn't come back alive. Why should l be afraid? God is with me. Who are you? Remove your mask. Stop...stop... l said stop. Stop...stop...come back. Who are you? Why are you wearing a mask? What do you want? Phone? Wait, l'll give. Tell me the number. lt is ringing. lt's ringing, speak. Brother, Bangarraju is none other than Narayana. Enough of scaring me, remove the mask and speak. What are you saying? Come fast. - Run... What were you doing when he was running away? Nobody can send me out from this market. l want this market. Tell him to get his daughter married to me. Where's my father, father-in-law? Stop the vehicle. Come back...come back... Brother! - Sir, found Mangababu. Forget about him later, kill Durga. Brother! Brother, stop! lt was an order to kill Durga only not you. Brother! What are you watching? Find him. Go! How did he come here? Your son told me to hide him here. What? Where is my son? - He's in Ongole. l must save my daughter, l must save my market. Above all that l must save myself. Hardly 10 days left to the marriage. Why are you matching horoscopes now? Ever since engagement, something bad is happening. They both must be happy, right? l've called astrologer to find if there are any defects and remedies. lf it doesn't match? - Will you cancel the marriage? He's very famous astrologer. MLA has sent him. Whatever he decides. Will this marriage happen, priest? After studying these two horoscopes, what l've come to know is, God, please cancel this marriage. This marriage will not happen. - Will it not? Take it down! l got it. l mean it won't happen ordinarily. Not ordinarily? - l mean celestial marriage. Groom and bride with these horoscopes will unite before marriage. Marriage will happen later. What do you mean by that? Baby, please come here. Your ear please. They applied powder and told me to say it won't happen, you applied more powder on it and told me to say about union. Why this third coating now? Do you've any doubts, grandma? Only that coating is balance, bye, l'll take leave.- Okay. Marriage is just 10 days away. lf what should happen after marriage is going to happen before. l'm feeling terribly shy. l couldn't bear the thought that he loves me. l'm unable to bear the feeling of being engaged to him. How can l bear this union before marriage? l'm going crazy. Why do you worry? Your father is here to take care of it. A good man like my father is of no use to me now. Urgently l need a bad boy! Who are you? Don't you know smoking is banned in market? Are you White? Who are you? Are you Black? No, bad man! He looks like a brief seller, is he a bad man? What do you want to cut? - Want to see? This is just a sample. lf you're a good man, l'm a bad man! here as much difference as Laden and Obama have between you and l. lt seems you said about making love with Sandy. Did she tell you also? Nothing of that sort would happen till l'm here. Are you warning me? - Yes, warning. Why are you warning so weakly? - lsn't it? Why am l getting kick if you drink? Not getting kick but going down. - What? Your blood. Tie this. lf you come to Sandy's house again, l'll cut my entire body. Get lost! He didn't warn me, he gave me an idea. Don't get tensed. l've given him a strong warning. He'll never come to you again. He's here...he's here... Why did you remove the fuse? Darkness suits the best for love. Put this fuse at right time. When? - When everything is over. When will it get over? Don't you know that, you thief? Put it when you hear a shriek. Don't get tensed, am l not here? He goes berserk in normal times, if he comes drunk, don't know what else would he do! Where have you gone? Where are you? Where did you go away, dear? Where is she? Are you hiding here? l'm coming....coming... l got you. Same dress! What's this? Trap? What are you planning? lf i'm in mood, l'll kill too. You're safe from now. You make an exit, l'll make an entry. Where are you? Come...come...come... Sandy is calling me, l'm coming... This is not that voice. Coming...coming... catch...catch... Why do you come in between us? Why are you sleeping here? There's something strange is happening here, madam. Come quickly, we must stop it. Where will you go now? lt looks like my boy's voice. The shriek must come from there, right? Who beat me? Why are you putting the fuse? l heard many shrieks. l'm confused which shriek is that! The next shriek will be louder, put the fuse then. Here! Bloody, he pinched me. Will you bite now? - l'll chew you. Stop...stop... Bad man's life may get ruined. l don't know if l'm man or woman. Stop...that was just interval. Where are you, Sandy? Are you here? Come fast! Sit here! Madam, run fast! Anything untoward could happen! He's a pain. He's not an ordinary man, spooky man! What's that language? - l too don't know. Why did you leave in interval? You want a break? Come, l'll buy you popcorn. Why so many shrieks at a time? What would have happened? Where will you go, dear? Please save me! - Are you shameless? You said you're a bad man, you want me to save you. He's worse than me. He's biting wherever he gets his teeth on. Go...go away! l can't take it anymore. Shut up! - Save me! Sandy, stop! Behave smoothly with ladies. Don't make them run. Sandy, don't go upstairs, father-in-law is there. Let's play downstairs only. Come...come... Are you going up? Go quickly. - Fuse is fixed! Why is he in this shape here? No...no... What's this hubby? Why are you in this condition? Oh my God! When he said he'll sleep along upstairs l thought something else. ls he having drinking habit too? l didn't know till today, mother-in-law. Why has my innocent son affected by such a disease? When l see this, l feel father-in-law is possessed by something. How could he get this disease without his knowledge? Ghost! - Ghost? Ghost may have possessed him. - Ghost? When and how did he take over him? Ghost? Only people possessed by ghost behave like this without their knowledge. ls it? ln day time it is calm but at night it goes berserk. Watch now How l'll overact! What happened? lt seems you're possessed by ghost. - Me? l'm fine. Didn't l tell you? Father-in-law doesn't know anything. Father-in-law, without your knowledge, you're roaming naked at night. Am l? No way...why? lt seems you've possessed by ghost. - Ghost? lnjustice has been meted to me, l can't bear it, mother-in-law... We must get rid of the ghost. - How?02 03 There's way for it. How? No please, wait. Not to father-in-law, it must hit the ghost inside, move away. What? Come again! Lakkamma? How many years are you with him? Didn't you find anyone else? 02 Didn't you desire get fulfilled? Are you living with him? lt seems its Lakkamma! Wait, l'll take you to task. Sister! Do you know Lakkamma? - l don't know. Who is she? Lakkamma was a famous call girl 17 years ago. She has possessed your husband. Yes, you drive her out. He you, how dare you take over my husband! Go away...leave him... l'll beat you! Leave him... That's our Dorababu! He's driving out ghost from someone. Go away! Who told him? How did he come to know? Mangababu escaped. Your father saw him. Why are you talking to him? Answer me first. What are you doing here? Why are you wearing white shirt? What business are you doing? Do you know which place is this? Do you know who he is? Do you know who am l? Will you tell him flashback again? What are you saying? - What am l saying? Did he ran away from home 10 years ago without you telling him? Did l tell him? - Yes.- Did l? Yes, son-in-law. You know the truth, right? What are you doing here despite knowing it? What should l do there knowing the truth? Can you roam without covering your face, father? You cover your face on seeing a stranger, why? Knowing well about your life, how can l not come here? What are you going to do? You must walk without covering your face. l must show to people this is my father's face. Till that happens and unmask him, l'll not come. l'll get back what you lost! - Did l ask you? Did l ask you to get back what l had lost? Did l ask you to give me birth, father? Didn't you do it? This is also like that, father. How am l to tell you, son? How can they both be same? What l lost there isn't great? The blame l'm carrying isn't a burden. l got you back alive, that's invaluable to me. What if anything happens to you? - Nothing will happen to me, father. Till now nothing happened to me, anything may happen if they know l'm your son. lf you stay here, it'll be harmful to me. Even if go away, your life is in danger. Adhikesavulu knows you're my son. He knows, right? Don't stay here for a moment also, father. Go away...go away! Please listen to me. - Go back to village, father. Send him away. How can l go away from here leaving him in this situation? We're not going anywhere, all are staying here only. For son-in-law's safety. Who is here for your safety? - Aren't you here? What about my safety? - Aren't we here for you? He must die today! Kill him...kill him. Do you've a weapon? l'm a weapon, why do l need a weapon? Sandy, don't get tensed and make me tense. Why are you both having full bottle? Overbearing sadness. - Too scared. l'm getting drunk. Why did he come back? Leave him to me, l'll take care of him. l'm your fan. What's this? What are you doing? l'm a bad man and he's worse than me. l understood it the hard way. Boss, a peg for me too. - Receive the guest. Are you human? Did you come for me, Sandy? Are you human? - What happened now? What happened? You jumped over wall and created a scene in my house. Everyone is asking if that thing is over. What am l to tell them? Yes, it's difficult to tell what never happened as happened. So, my idea to you is... Don't come near me, l'm warning you. l've a big weapon. l'll stab you. Show me. She stabbed my son! She stabbed in his heart! Who is she? She's Adhikesavulu's daughter. How is she connected to him? Your son is going to marry her. - Oh my God! They ruined my daughter's life. lf you shout and if they know you're here, he'll stab me. Stab you? l'll stab everyone here. How can she marry my son-in-law? What's this? This is what remains after you stabbed him. Then, he... - Can't say if he can survive. Are you blind? - Sorry, l didn't see you. Who are you? You lousy girl! Why are you roaming in this street only? l almost broke my waist. What do you think of yourself? You bloody bitch! Stop...stop... How dare you come here and hit Saroja sister, who are you? Remove the helmet! - Remove the helmet! Will you remove or shall l slap you? ls it you? Are you here for White? Why don't you tell me that? How do you feel now? Are you here for me? Come, let's go upstairs. - l'll not come. isn't he calling you? Go! This is our house. Get up...get up... A girl will come here in a week. watching TV serials. l don't know what you like or don't like. l'm doing everything assuming you'd like it. lf you don't like tell me, l'll change it. ls he doing everything for me? He says out of 10 things he tells 6 lies and 4 truths. But is this completely truth? l've brought soaps and scents. - Keep it there. Generally people buy more soaps and less scents. Why are you buying more scents and less soaps? l'm not yet clear about the usage of soaps and scents by my wife. Once l'm clear we can buy accordingly. That's kitchen! Can't cook! That's our bedroom. Don't get tensed, l'll enter this room only after you love me. But our horoscopes say we'll unite in love before marriage. What shall we do now? That's bathroom. l'll change it. Why are you surprized? l'll always say 10 things, 6 lies and 4 truths. But l'm telling only one thing about you, l like you. l and my home would await you. Enough...enough of watching... Enough...enough of what you did... You dropped the anchor with your long skirt and half sari... You created a sensation with your square design lungi... Hey girl enough of killing me with your sensuous beauty... Hey boy, enough of rushing on me like a Ongole bull... When you smile my little heart would go pounding crazily... My eyes would brighten up... With your lightning touch my shyness would vanish... You get the fruit of love easily... Don't pound me with desires... Don't increase my hunger... Now that l'm here, come l'll serve you hot... No more days of hunger for you... Enough of making me go crazy with your sensuous waist... Enough of biting my sweet lips with your desires... Your beauty is pulling me, l came running to you sleepless... May l've your beauty, even if you say no, l'll not leave you... When you praise me, my heart and my youth is all yours... Don't tom-tom it in public, l'll rap your head with love... l'll tie the knot with you... and be your life partner... Then, l'm read, let's find the nearest temple... Come, let's play game of love, enough of teasing me... Enough of squeezing the pillow watching me over the wall... Why are you surprized? Minister, you break the good news. File to shift market has been signed. Why are you not reacting? Won't you believe Minister also? Happy that it is moving, l'm afraid people may oppose it. Tomorrow l'll announce this in market, Adhikesavulu will finish it. Hello, we don't care about your govt. or it's decisions, my people, it must do good to the market, that is enough. There are few good things in your decision, l've seen it, l'm thinking over it. He's here only. Order a new car, sir. Father-in-law, l see many bad things in it.

Govt. will not shift this market. l'm dying unable to answer Minister and those Bombay guys. You want to end up as good man. What happened? You lost both daughter and market to him. This is what remains with you. Have it. lf l shouldn't die, then he must die. Don't go, stop! Load those 16 bags. Note it down. Till now you tried to unmask me, now l'm going to unmask your father.

White, whom l thought was God till now is behaving like a demon. My daughter's marriage is fixed with your son. What would you achieve with marriage without shifting the market? Market yard will be shifted. Marriage is at 4 am! Market yard will go up in flames at 4.30 am! What are you planning to do with Narayana? ln the lakhs of bags that will go up in flames, he will be in one of those bags. Go immediately and save your father. What about the marriage? Father...father... Father! Father! Father! Market is burning down! Sir, our market is burning down. Dorababu! Didn't l tell you he's a crook? Look what has he done to us?

Till l usurped his good name. l killed 32 people and put the blame on your father. 33, l killed my paternal uncle too. Wrong again! 34! l killed my father too! Mustn't live! Do you know why? l mustn't get what a bad man like father got in his life, and to get everything a good man like your father gets, do you know this? lt's very easy to show a good man like your father as bad man. But it's very difficult to prove a man like me as bad who acts like good man. You showed me naked, but could you show my real self? Got angry? Will you kill me? Kill me, l'm ready. But l'll never utter with my mouth that your father is a good man. Do you know why? lf a statue is installed in market, it must be mine! When you say 10 things, it has 6 lies and 4 truths, l don't have any confusion like that, if l say 10 things, all ten are lies! Go, spend your life like your father in hiding. Douse it! Get water! You go that side! You all go that side. Come here. Come. Come quickly, what happened? Bloody crook! You've been unmasked! Your film is over. Don't act anymore. People will lynch you. Father, you're not Bangarraju anymore. You're the king of this market! How you acted and cheated us all these days? How many lives you've taken? - Kill him... Why did you do like this?

Dear son, you loved the girl, right? Loved her? Where did l've time for it? Half of my life is over fighting for you. Not a kiss...not a hug... At least that? No! When will you marry then? - We need 3 months. What will you do till then? ln future you'll get many such treats. Have a go! Who are you? What are you doing here? Having a party in my family's marriage? - Marriage? Who brought you here? White, biryani is great! Fourth plate, great taste! How dare you party in our marriage? What's wrong if we party? Do you know who is he? Son of chillie market yard Chairman. Tell me how much is the bill after party, he'll pay along with tip. You mean?

You tore all the memorabilia of our love. That's why this party! Would any sane man say this is party? You... lt'll be like this now, after ten years this will be very nice to remember. Bloody idiot! What sort of love is this? Mass love! You can never forget it. Will you tease a girl you love like this? l'll kill you. Hey mad man! Go away!
