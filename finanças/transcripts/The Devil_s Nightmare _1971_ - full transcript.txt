Call the Baron Calm yourself, he's coming Be strong, madame Well? So, Hans? The baroness is exhausted Her heart is very weak It's a boy? Baron... Your wife... Tell me, is it a boy? N0. It's a little girl A girl... Baron, are you alright? Is it a girl? G0 to the shelter, it's dangerous here And you, General? It's an order, Hans, go now And Madame...? The dead are out of danger, Gerda And your daughter? I'll take care of her G0 now, Gerda, I'll follow you I heard your family has suffered a terrible curse for many years It seems a curse has been visited on my family for centuries But that's not a subject for your magazine It depends on how it's written, surely Will you allow me to take photos of the castle? - Out of the question. - But... Please don't insist - Will we arrive by nightfall? - I hope so What are you doing? You trying to kill us? It wasn't my fault. There's something in the way See? The road's closed There's someone over there Go and ask him. How do we get to Hohlenstadt? There's only the ferry, 50 kilometres away... But never after sunset You'll be too late Are there any hotels around here? You could ask at the castle The Baron sometimes agrees to receive paying guests ls it far? Turn round, go past the village, it's on your left Where did you find her? Near Baron Von Runberg's castle You think she was murdered? I think it was a heart attack It's like she was terrified Yes, people can die of fear Of fear? What's that, doctor? It's the Devil's mark The succubus has returned to the castle The door's opening by itself What was that? Just some falling masonry It's very beautiful Yes, beautiful. But it could have killed me Look there Don't be afraid, it's just a toad - Help me with the luggage It's going to pour down - There's no-one here? - It's your job to find out S0, Mr. Ducos, where are you taking us now? Well I... Follow me... With all the rain, this castle gets even more mysterious Is anybody up there? Welcome to castle Von Runberg Don't be alarmed. The castle is full of hazzards We were told you might give us shelter tonight I prepared everything after the telephone call Phone call? Who called? I don't know, sir It was a female voice She gave me your names If you come with me I'll show you to your rooms This is your room, Father Sorry, I'm not a priest yet. I study theology in the seminary Please do not leave your bag there Why not? Look at the mark in front of the fireplace On 13th December 1569... the date on which Erika Von Runberg... disappeared in the night with the monk who exorcised her Erika disappeared, leaving this Devil's mark Exorcised? Why? Because of a family curse Baron Von Runberg may explain it to you later Mr and Mrs Forster, this is your room What's that? Sometimes pigeons fall down the chimneys of the castle It's not unusual Possibly... But finding a wounded bird is a strange welcome It's an historic room, sir In 1437, the Prince and Princess de Hardt... had their throats cut while they slept Throats cut? But that was in 1437 He's insane This is your room, Mr. Ducos And this is yours, Mr. Masson I hate stuffy rooms. Can't you air it? - It's impossible, sir - Why impossible? - The window is sealed - Sealed? After the inexplicable accident... that cost the life of Eric Von Runberg in 1735 Enough of these gruesome stories I'll never be able to sleep alone in this castle Maybe we should share? I have just what you need, miss Well? I showed them to their rooms, Baron Fine, serve dinner at eight o'clock Why not have your bath? It's ready Let me rest a while, I'm so tired Let me help you I've never seen such a lazy girl If I don't help you we'll be late for dinner Your skin is so soft I know your tastes, Howard You haven't been able to keep your eyes off her Enough, Nancy I told you, I have no interest in Corinne You've been all over her since we got here My money is all that interests you I'm tired of satisfying your every need, Howard I would enjoy getting a divorce My love, how could I live without you? Sometimes I wonder, Howard I see you collect weapons Not only do I collect, but every morning I train with Hans He was my assistant during the war Speaking of Hans, why does he insist on scaring your guests? They're all strange here Come in, please - Baron Von Runberg - Max Ducos - Some port? - With pleasure Can I tell you something? Ten years I've done these tours, you're the first seminarian I've had Just between us, this is my first guided tour And very badly guided True, but it's all working out fine now Can't complain about this place You think not? I can't open my bedroom window... the butler has a hideous face And that baron is very strange Could it be worse? I hope the ladies are comfortably settled Yes, but I must say that your castle is somewhat forbidding Old castles are always a bit austere, miss Dinner is served, sir Shall we go to the dining room? Please forgive this... improvised dinner It's perfect Baron, will you tell us about the Von Runberg curse? If you insist But I don't want to spoil your appetites Don't worry about me When I'm hungry, I could sup with the Devil I was just about to mention him In the 12th century, my ancestor, Siegfried Von Runberg... made a pact with the Devil You mean that he sold his soul to the Devil? In exchange for his services, as well as the soul of Siegfried... Satan demanded that the eldest daughter... of every generation of our family be in his service That she would become a succubus - And what is a Succubus? - A sort of a vampire, I suppose You're mistaken, Mr. Masson A Succubus is a demon who takes female form... to seduce men and lead them to perdition It's not necessary to be a Succubus Any woman can do that Personally, I don't believe such things Me neither. D0 you deny the existence of the Devil? I don't believe in vampire or Succubus I'm an atheist, thank God Unfortunately all the girls in our family became Succubi All my ancestors were the victims of a violent death D0 you have a daughter, Baron? You again? What are you doing here? Why? Aren't you pleased to see me? You promised never to set foot in here again The roads are blocked I can't be out in weather like this Did you forget that today is the anniversary of the...? I'm sorry, miss, we have unexpected guests The castle is full There's one room left, Martha The Baron insists on hospitality - What name shall I say? - My name is Hilse, Hilse Milller - May I use the phone? - Of course, it's right there I don't think the phone's working It worked a little while ago It must be the storm, there's no connection Perhaps It's the first time that's happened Could you come with me, miss? I'll show you to your room I bid you welcome Please take a seat I'd love to see your laboratory You want to see my laboratory? Very well You may be disappointed. Alchemy is nothing spectacular An oven, a few mortars... But it's enough to turn lead into gold Well, to at least try D0 you have a hobby, too? Yes, men Even the married ones? What do you think about fidelity, Mr. Forster? Well, nothing good And you, Mr. Sorel? Anything to say about it? Don't fool yourself. Faithfulness to God is not easy - Look at that pig - Don't be unkind, Mr Masson Your housekeeper does not seem to appreciate our presence Forgive Martha, she's a wonderful woman - My brother was very fond of her - You have a brother? An older brother, Rudolf He was burned alive inside his tank in Stalingrad Don't be alarmed The generator sometimes stops when it rains Light some candles and serve coffee in the lounge What's up with you? Hurry up with that coffee We hear this music every time the Succubus appears Can't you talk about anything other than Succubi? In fact, today is the anniversary of the covenant Enough, Hans. Please change the subject You have too much imagination Could the Baron tell me who's playing the harmonium? That's none of your concern You can serve the liqueur now Check... and mate But this is impossible You're very lucky, Mr. Sorel No, I play well, that's all Your only mistake was not paying attention to my queen Who knows what a queen could offer a young seminarian? I wish you all a good night Hans will remain at your disposal if you need anything You forgot your promise? My promise? Follow me, but I assure you my laboratory is nothing special Can we meet when the others are asleep, Corinne? If only for a few minutes Just for... a few minutes? No, of course not So... where and when? Behind the attic staircase. At midnight See you then I have to go to the bus, anyone need anything? As a matter of fact, I forgot my paper I'll get it Goodnight... I'm off to bed Checkmate No, Madam. Making gold is not the main goal of the alchemist Have you ever turned lead into gold? My main pleasure is searching for philosophical truths It's late, I'll take you back Don't worry. I can find my own way back Take this candle Don't get lost - What are you doing here? - Did I frighten you? There are very strange things going on in this castle I was going out to investigate, but I couldn't open the door Let's go into the dining room Three games and three victories. You really are a good player I am used to more difficult opponents than Mr. Masson - Have you got my things? - It's impossible to go outside, the key is in the door, but I can't open it What have I done to deserve such useless people? All right, come on. I'll open the door for you, you'll see Come with us Mr. Forster Hold this, give me good light Just like I said Can't you help instead of staring at me like that? - It's impossible to open it - This isn't normal Hold on... hold on At least I'm giving it a try That sounded like Regine. Come on, quickly What is it? What's happened? Blood on the ceiling N0 need to panic. There must be some explanation Like the front door? I'll see what's the matter Who's with me? Look at this It's horrible Who would torture a helpless creature? Well? You think that's normal? It was you who drove us here Look over there It's a sarcophagus And that's a guillotine You seen a lot of attics like this? Well, none of this will keep me awake You're going to stay here? I have to clean up - I wish you a good night, sir - Good night, Hans Don't worry It was just an injured cat trapped up there But keep the door locked. You never know - Did you lock the door, Howard? - Yes, my love Lots of strange things in this castle The strangest of all is Baron Von Runberg making gold Go to sleep. I'll just close the window - I couldn't sleep - It must be the storm What are you reading? A book about the Von Runberg curse Listen to this... Succubi appear mainly at night... They use all their lascivious charm to seduce hermits... with the sight of their shameless nudity Do you find me lascivious? Shameless? What if I were naked in front of you? Do you think I could be... a Succubus? If you could see your face... It's so funny It's good to hear laughter So rare in this castle Take a seat Doesn't it look great? Would you like some wine? You're not coming? Looking for an imaginary treasure? I saw gold in his lab I'm sure there's more hidden If it's true, Nancy, the gold doesn't belong to us Whatever you say Let's go How about a final glass of wine? The best... Sounds good The Devil leaves this mark on all who make a pact with him There is another explanation, which says that God forced the Devil... to mark his creatures with this symbol... so all cursed souls might know each other You frightened me Are you looking for the treasure? You too? There's enough for both of us Come with me I'm sure the Baron hides his gold in this cellar Let's look Help me. - And if l left now...? - Don't joke What would you say? Enough. Stop it. I'm trying to sleep here. Let's go somewhere else Let me out. Whoever you are. Stop this. Someone's trying to make a fool of me here Are you the ones making the noise? I've seen you. You're not going to get away from me. I've seen you. You don't have to stand Why are you always here at this hour? It's very late I must have fallen asleep I should go to bed now Am I upsetting you? Not at all Why are you so nervous? I'm not used to being alone with a beautiful woman You really find me beautiful? D0 you have a cigarette? - And you? - I don't smoke No use running away, Alban You'll die just like the others - The others? - Yes, I killed them all I killed them in the state of mortal sin They died because of their sins Why did you kill them? I am a Succubus... Alban G0 now, Hilse, I shall deal with him Why did you run away? I mean you no harm I'm not afraid of you. You have no power over men Come closer then Why don't you come outside? Why don't you come inside? You speak defiantly, because your body is protected But your thoughts are troubled You desire Hilse Your nights will be long, Alban I will spend them in prayer. And in penance For the moment, I am satisfied with your companions But I'll come back for you later Wait. Can I propose a deal? A deal? Release the poor souls of those who died... and I will accept damnation Such pride Why would I trade souls I already have for one I will have soon? But think of the souls I'll save if I become a priest You don't have my soul yet Instead of saving souls that are of no use to you... would you not rather have earthly riches? Love...? All I want is the souls of my companions Will you not feel remorse? Will you follow me blindly? Sign... and those six souls will be free Mr Sore]? We're waiting for you I'll be right down I had a terrible nightmare after all these stories of Succubi Tell me about it I wouldn't call the Baron a champion And his butler is a total animal The Baron has been wounded Please sit I would like to... I'd like to unburden my conscience Please don't tire yourself The ambulance is coming I don't hear you well Yesterday... I lied I did have a daughter I killed her In her cradle You killed your own daughter? She was the oldest... the oldest Von Runberg And cursed - How is he now? - Not good, Martha... we can only pray It was because of Hilse that the accident happened She is cursed. You're mistaken. Hilse is not to blame But you don't know the truth - Hilse is a succubus - Such things don't exist Anyway, Hilse is not a Von Runberg Hilse... is my daughter Her father was Rudolf Von Runberg He died without knowing that I was pregnant And I never had the courage to tell the Baron He would have killed her Hilse... she is the oldest child of the Von Runberg's Come on, hurry up or we'll never get there in time Anyone seen Mr. Sorel? He's at the Baron's bedside I'm sorry about the Baron, but we can't stay here forever My mother talked to you? S0 you know everything Can you believe I am a Succubus... but didn't know it? It's terrible to live in doubt N0, Hilse, Succubi are just legends You are sure of that? No... You're just trying to reassure me Will we meet again... Alban Fate will decide Here comes Mr. Sorel Where's your luggage? I can't leave a dying man. Go on without me I'll make my own way Well, good luck then Let's go to the terrace to say goodbye for the last time
