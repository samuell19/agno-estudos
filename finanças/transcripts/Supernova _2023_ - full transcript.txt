Girls, we go to Bucket tonight, a must! Obvious! Sure thing. Yeah... You, too. Don't play dumb. - Why? - We're a sure win. If so, I win a film and mom's carbonara. - What a pain! - She's obnoxious. Maybe you don't get it. Andrea's bringing a friend tonight. Here, look. - He's ugly. - Ugly? No! No, wait! Sorry... - A dud, sweets! - What's wrong with him? You can't say he's ugly. He's on special at the supermarket. You're nuts. You're long gone! Okay, stop, I'll come. C'mon! - We have a race! - You're coming, eh? Sure, sure... The bottle, hon. Elsa! - Hold. - Not the visor, c'mon! - I have delicate skin. - You're too much! Women's 200-meter Heat at the start. - Ready? - Charged. We're go. Attention... go! Go! Go! Elsa, stretch! Go! Go. Rhythm. - Stretch. - I'm not with it! Again! What's the matter? More, c'mon! Elsa! SUPERNOVA In a few minutes she'll be taken to her section. I'm sorry, this evening she has to stay under observation. Why? I don't understand. I told you, ma'am... her platelets are too low, her leucocytes are high. We have to examine in depth. She had no breakfast this morning, then the race, the excitement, maybe even a touch of flu? I'm sorry. We'll put her in Hematology. We'll run all the tests. Okay? I brought all your things, especially... fresh spring rolls, the fried ones are rich. Okay, but you got the fried ones? Of course! We'll get the test results in the morning. Okay. Hello! Let's make room for chicken and puree. Thank you. That's it, right off? The rules. Actually, you should go now. I can't stay here tonight? Of course... What time for breakfast tomorrow? Mom, don't worry. - You're sure? - Yes, go. Bye, darling. - Call me for any reason. - Sure. Goodbye... very kind! Excuse me. May I? Bye! It's even worse than it looks. Rest. ROBERTA We won't race until you're back... ROBERTA How are you? Any news? ELSA Not yet... ROBERTA We're waiting for you... She was lacing her shoe, the comfy one, but, while distracted, a radioactive spider bit her. That's not possible! So, to defeat their fairy godmother who wanted her to wear those darned crystal sneakers, she ran away, directly to another planet. And that's how Snow White became an Avenger. That's not possible! - She's a princess, not a prince. - Anyway, she became an Avenger! Off to bed now. - No! - Yes. Matti, help me out. Okay, we'll go to bed, but tomorrow we want the one about the Supernova. A promise. - Let's go to bed. - Tomorrow the one about Supernova! Are you here for the Supernova story, too? No. I was looking for snacks. You shouldn't eat off-schedule. - Aren't you too young for a doctor? - Nurse. So, you know where the snack machines are? Like to take a walk? Meaning? A walk. Where are you going? - Can we? - Come! What are you doing here? I don't know, I feel fine. Just a touch of the flu. But they're doing loads of tests. It's normal, part of the initial routine. Listen, if you agree, we could do some extra tests to see what you have, what you don't... But if you agree. Okay? - Tests? - Yes. Easy stuff. Okay? All right. Join your pinky and thumb on your knee. - Like this? - Yes, on your knee. Just one leg, eyes closed and keep your balance as long as you can. Excellent. Excellent! Isn't this for drunks? Now, the same thing, but crawling. You're jerking me around. Thanks a lot, eh! I feel much better! I get it, you're touchy. - And you're a nurse? - A novice. - But I'm good. - So-so. You should be more serious if you want a career. Who said I want a career, Thing-o? Elsa. Don't you have a tad of ambition, Thing-o? Edo. At the moment, my ambition is to win the sandwich contests. Sandwich contests? Are you my grandmother? What stress! And you? Are you six? Sandwich contests? I thought you were very sweet, but after this, it's over. Really? Too bad. You've also got some food in your teeth. - Is this better? - Finally! Am I sexy like this? Hi, darling. Hi. Hi, Elsa. We have your test results. It's called acute myeloid leukemia. We should start treatment. The first step is chemotherapy. The disease is in remission. That means you're much better. - Will I get out of isolation? - Yes. In a few days you can go home for a while. You're on the list for a marrow transplant. Unfortunately, there's no matching donor so far. Your mother will donate. Parents are 50% compatible. It's not the best solution, but it's a good one. I'll take care of it. I'll put these in here. Remember to take them. A NEW TEXT FROM Roberta 2 NEW TEXTS FROM Roberta 3 NEW TEXTS FROM Roberta 4 NEW TEXTS FROM Roberta Don't answer. You can tell them all to piss off. Right. You've been freed! I wanted to visit you in the bunker but Carla was defending her territory. Turn around... Nice, you look younger. I'm 17! How do you feel? Excellent prospects. 50% is an excellent prospect? What university did you attend? You know Mattia, the little one in pediatric oncology? He's 10 with a 10% chance of making it. I've had two horrible weeks. I don't say I'm worse off than him, but... The worst is over! I see! You're already one of those insensitive nurses. Edo, tell me you did the IV! With ice, practically a spritz. - Get back to your room. - What room? - His! - My private office. Since I can tell people to piss off, you're the first. Now who's insensitive? How are you? Fine, fine... this is just a pit stop. A few weeks of check-ups, an engine re-vamp, maybe a soup-up... Really? Look at me. Would I joke about this? I had a transplant six months ago. So, you can tell me what it's like. Who's your donor? My mother. No brothers or sisters? Works better. An only child, no father. Stop playing nurse? I'm sorry about your father. He's not dead! I mean... not that I know. Question on the absent father in three, two, one... Happens often? It's the story of my life. - The short version. - Very short. He left before I was born, I don't even know his name. - Maybe a transient. - Yeah, with a hairy back. Like Ben Affleck. - No, Leonardo Di Caprio. - To each his own. Your mother's here, what do I do? I send her away, say to wait... No, I'm coming. Bye. Can I have pasta with goat cheese and pepper if I'm... EDO has started to follow you. Follow Already following EDO What are you doing? ELSA I'm at a rave party! ELSA What parties do you go to? This is the sandwich contest? EDO No, that's me before I threw up EDO What are you doing? ELSA I'm at a rave party! EDO And you go diving in the Tiber. Are you a canoeist? ELSA A rower! We're going backwards, can't you see? EDO A common sport with young people ELSA "Inland Voyage" ELSA I read it at 8 and it changed my life EDO What a sad childhood! ELSA Screw you! I don't see why I can't take the responsibility. What's the matter? I can't donate, he says I'm not eligible. - We found a heart problem... - Which is damn nothing! I take a pill once a day and I'm fine. It's not even a disease, it's a condition. And so? We wait for a donor from the public register. - There aren't any. - Yes, but one might come in. - We have to wait... - No way. - We'll change hospitals, c'mon. - No, wait. No sense changing hospitals. The protocols are valid everywhere. C'mon, we'll talk about it at dinner. We'll see... if we should change hospitals. I know it's hard. I'm sorry. - I dozed off? - Yes. So, she's looking for your father? Yes. I saw this photo on her computer last night. I think she knew they wouldn't let her donate. You're sure? - You've talked to her? - No. The picture was an e-mail attachment. A colleague sent it, a tweaker. It's from a festival at Lago Lungo. I still don't get it. She's your mother, why don't you talk? It's not easy. You can't get the picture. It's not a normal story. My mom never mentions my father. Okay, but you need a transplant. If she's looking, make sure she finds him. We haven't been here in ages! Always good, eh? I'm looking into another hospital, one whose doctors are a little more... updated. I know you're looking for my father. I saw the picture. I thought I would. But then, no. He wouldn't help you anyway. Why not? Because I will. Don't worry. Well, did you talk to your mother? Yes, she said she's not looking. And he wouldn't help me anyway. But why? Dunno! It's all... It's all a mystery. Parents always come unraveled. My mother's teaches Physics, when she learned I was sick she paid 800 euro for a Tarot Reading. So, what do I do? I'm going nuts. You have that crappy picture, you know where he lives, you don't need her to find him. The picture is 2 years old, maybe he was passing through. And I don't even know his name. Anyway, I won't go looking alone. Not alone. But with me you can. With you? Yes. And they just released me. I passed the revision! It was about time! It's fantastic. Anyway, no. Then send the picture and I'll go alone. I'll pick you up, okay? Meaning, you want to go now? No, we'll organize for New Year's... Move! And bring your bathing suit! Here we are! I'm so stressed, like we're pulling a heist. The first bone-marrow heist in history. I left my mom a message with bullshit. No more guilty feelings. - Set the navigator. - Okay. Continue for 165 feet... Anyway, my "maybe father" might be this guy's friend. There's a booth, maybe at a festival, it says "King of... Stoves"? So, this King of Stoves is your father? No, that's his friend, my father's the other one. - Did you Google it? - Yes, got nothing. - Watch the road, please! - What a pain! You have a license, right? Mind your business. - No? - What do you think? Again? Since when? A month. I can't believe it. I can't believe it... Sure? I'll throw you out of the car. Three, two, one... I'll throw myself out if you have no license! What if he has another family? Please! Sorry, I conked out. There was just one with chocolate. Obviously I'll have it myself. Here, strawberry. Not even half? Huh? Litterbug! - Mom? - Tell me it's a joke. You're with a friend? Who is he? - I met him in the hospital. - Is he sick too? No, he's fine now. Doesn't your friend know you just finished chemo? Give me two days. Who is he? Let me talk to him! Have I even given you trouble? You are now, big trouble. I'll call tonight, I swear. We can expect helicopters, the Navy... frogmen... Where do we begin? Dunno. Hello... 2 MISSED CALLS FROM Mom - Yes, King of Stoves. - Thank you very much. You're welcome, goodbye! The lady knows the King of Stoves. She does? - So? - I'll explain as we go. Excuse me... is this your booth by chance? They told us... your chef is a sort of institution. He's called the "King of Stoves". "Lord of the Range", not "King of Stoves". Thank you. But at least we ate. - The check. - Thank you. Thank you. Walk out. - I'll be right along. - Huh? Trust me. I've got this, go! Run like the wind! Shit! Sit up, block it. Is it normal? Baw, stop! It's just a little blood, relax. Need help? Do you have any hankies? Wait, I'll find them. Block it. Sit up. How are you doing? Fine. Does it happen often? Got another one here. Something cool? Did it scare you? - How is it? - A little more, block it. - What a disaster! - No, hold it there. Thank you. - I'm Mila. - Edo. - Elsa. - This is Baw. At 10 I thought it was a nice name. Poor thing. - Can you make it to the car? - Sure. - Want another one? - No. - So, you're all set? - Yes, thank you. Bye. Guys, wait. Could you give me a lift? I argued with my boyfriend and I'm stranded. But where? I work in a nearby camping ground. You're from here? No, I do the camping season and surf. And I'm with Lorenzo when he's not a jerk. Can't say you're too easy-going either. Me? I'm cool. He pisses me off, flirts even with trees. And I think he's into something. Did you catch him on texts, or stuff? No, that's the problem. For now, I'm the paranoid. Could you drive smoother? I feel like throwing up. Relax! Do you have another tent, by chance? Because we don't know where to sleep. Sure, we'll work something out. Great. Thank you. See that? He's not coming over. - Yeah, but you left him on the beach. - He deserved it? Yes. I'd say it's not a solution, if I may. I know, she talks like a grannie. No way! I just mean to see it in general. Hear that? In general... If you find out you have 6 months to live, the general picture is shot to hell. Guys, what kind of talk is that? Look! Why, do you think? Dunno. Excuse me! Hi! Why the fireworks? Is there a celebration? Not a celebration, a party. Celebration, party... It's Luciano, he's here to sell. Mornings it's firecrackers, at night he pushes all sorts of stuff. Red: hash, green: weed and blue is a fabulous thing that... if you're not in the mood, I'd advise against it. Listen, what do we do tomorrow? Dunno! Relax a little. Now what do we talk about? I don't know! Want a Supernova story? Not Supernova, no! What's this, a black hole? No, it's more a type of fireworks. - In essence, it works... - Wait! Wait. Wait... It might be the "King of Strobes". Not the "King of Stoves". Shit! Hi! Hi. Good evening. Can I show you a picture? This... It's twenty a gram. No, we'd like to see if you know this man. Why are you looking for him? So, you know him? No. It's twenty a gram. Here. - You done? - What? - He knows him! - Forget it, let's go. What's wrong? The guy, my father... I don't know if I want to find him. What do you care about the guy now? Forget it, I don't want to, that's all. Look, I know. Thinking about death is like... I don't know, it's like an extreme sport. If you think too much, you end up killing yourself directly. Actually, what's hard is keeping your brain under control. Okay, you say, I'm no prime example and here too, I have to say you're right. But... Are you here? Anyway, that's the Big Dipper, even I know that. Okay. Nice, my effect on you. 3 MISSED CALLS FROM Mom 1 NEW TEXT FROM MOM Will you answer? I'm going crazy. Headache? I was connecting to Mother Earth. Ugly beast. - And that? - Take it. - You're sure? - Smoke it. Thanks. How did it go with your guy? The usual story. Listen, ah... is she sick? Leukemia. Actually, she's trying to locate her father. He should be her donor. Will you help us? Good morning! Thank you for the jacket. Listen, I think Mila can give us a hand. How? I don't remember. I need coffee. Okay, let's go. No need to race! Here you are! For once, Lorenzo did a right thing. In what way? Lorenzo is best buddies with the guy, Luciano. He found out where your father is. Fantastic! His name's Pietro and he lives in a farmhouse not far from here. I'll finish serving breakfast and take you. Perfect. You told her everything? Maybe I wanted to tell her myself! - Elsa, we got him! - We don't even know if it's him. Listen, you want to find him or not? Yes. Good. That should be it, the one at the end of the road. INCOMING CALL FROM Mom C'mon, get out. 4 MISSED CALLS FROM Mom Okay, let's go. Looks like no one's here. Help me. You're crazy. It's him. Inland Journey I knew it couldn't be mom's. Guys! Maybe I know where you can find him. LifeMusic Restaurant, this is a shift schedule. Tonight. Call, c'mon. - Who? - Your mom! She must be worried, you promised. Yes, I should. 5 MISSED CALLS FROM Mom 1 NEW TEXT FROM MOM Send me your position or I call the police Not now. Was the water cold? Yeah. Nervous? No. How come? Dunno. Maybe also thanks to you. Listen, um... do you think, if we'd met at a party, would we have noticed each other? You're saying you like me because I'm sick? That's pretty disturbing. No! It was just... Well, who knows if I'd have noticed you. No, I mean, we have this bad thing in common, that brings us close. And it's nice. But it's for a bad reason. Maybe I'm not explaining it! Could this also be a wrong relationship? Lord, what's a wrong relationship? What if there were nothing? That's an exaggeration! I gave you six months. Seems like no one's here. You've decided how to tell him? Like this! I'm your daughter. I have leukemia and only you can save me. Understand? Do that, and he'll run away on the first flight to Mexico. In 165 feet turn right. Sure you don't want me to come? No, I'll go alone. Okay, I'm here. What is it? My name's Elsa. Listen, I'm busy. My mother's name is Katia. Your mother knows you're here? How did you find me? We were on the beach... - And... - Want some water? - Sara, bring some water? - Right away. Listen... Thank you. That boy outside watching us, who is he? He's my boyfriend. What does he know? What do you know about me? Nothing. No, I know... that you don't... want anything to do with my life. You never legally acknowledged me. That's not exactly how it went. Then how? I want to know about you. Are you studying? I'm doing... going into my senior year. And then civil engineering, I think. Good for you! You have it all planned. - I do rowing too. - Really? - Rowing, not canoeing. - I know the difference. Why rowing? I didn't like ballet. - But rowing isn't for everyone. - Want to see? Sure. This is me. - This one here? - Yes. You're good. Look at you go! - Why did you turn it off? - It's my fault we lost. - You didn't end up in the water! - No. No. I have leukemia. I need you, I need a marrow transplant. What should I do? - A blood test, I think. - Where's it done? But first, you acknowledge paternity. I can't. You don't risk anything, it's just... - But why? - I was never here, not interested. Bye. What's going on? - He said no, let's go. - Meaning? - He's an asshole, forget it. - I'll talk to him. - No! - You can't always step aside... Mind your fucking business, he's my father, okay? Then sorry I didn't let you die, I should have realized. - What? - Everything's a burden for you. You're a bastard. - Having fun, eh? - Great fun. You don't get a thing, trust me. Anyway, everything's for yourself. Mom? You gave me a heart attack. Are you all right? How did you find me? I found him. You were right, I'm sorry. No, you were. He doesn't want to help me. I know. Yes, but now I'll take care of this. Stay there. No, wait! What's going on? Wake up! Mom, call an ambulance. I can't believe he lied to me. He told me he was cured. Try not to think of that now. You're in love? I was in love too. With your father, very much. I suffered a lot too. Now you have to tell me. We were kids... About your age. We were in... a ring of drug dealing, petty theft. That's not why I liked him, but there was... that adrenaline. We were stupid, irresponsible. And then I got pregnant. And so he left? No, I said: "Now we end this crap" and he said: "Certainly, of course..." It even seemed he was trying. Then, one day the police came... and arrested him for international trafficking, I had no idea. Tell me it's not true, or I'll go nuts. I was 7 months pregnant, I went to visit him and said he'd never see me again. Two years later, I heard he'd escaped. He didn't look for me, right? I wanted to protect you. Sure. Come with me. You have five minutes. See how charming I am? Why didn't you say anything? Take the mask off, I can't hear you. Why didn't you say anything? I wanted to be happy for a while. Without thinking of the consequences. I'd have ended up here anyway. It was fantastic. I'd do it all over again. So, I was right, you did it for you. No, for both of us. 50%. Okay, maybe 55 for me, 45 for you. There. How did it go with your dad? He disappeared. He was a criminal, a real criminal. I think I managed to slip my number into his pocket. He might change his mind. Stop. Now I don't give shit about me. I do. Actually, you know that notebook, the famous one, that's on the night table? Take it, I want you to be the animator in my place. No. - You refuse my legacy? - Stop it. We shouldn't have let him leave. I'm sorry. He said he was well. It's something devastating. A gigantic explosion, a brilliant luminosity. The energy released can exceed that of an entire galaxy... Are you asleep? No. - You? - No. It's so stupid to sleep and dream about sleeping. True. I miss you. Why? I'm here. It's a shame the fireworks block out the stars. But, look, there's weed! How are you feeling? Any news of the donor? I found a picture that really made me laugh, one I took of you and Edo! I'll show you. No! No? No. You can't eat at this hour. Neither can you. What do you want? That one. Would you like to tell us a story? He goes to Iron Man and asks him... if he can loan him the armor. She comes back from the wolf... It wasn't like that, was it? I can't do it. Let's go to bed, it's late. - Hello. - Hi, Elsa. This should be it. Thank you. - I don't know how... - Listen! Sometimes I go into Edo's phone. I found a text asking about you. I put the number in the booklet. If you want... Bye. There are no wrong stories, just stories narrated badly! You're worse than I thought, but I'm glad I looked for you, because there are journeys we have to take even if, in the end, bad things await us. But you do have one good thing... That canoe hanging from the ceiling. Good? Specialty of the house. Can I ask you something? Certainly. If I hadn't been born, what would you have done? Look, it's what I care less about in the whole world. So, I can... stop feeling guilty for having kept you from becoming... What? What should I have become? - A ballerina, a musician... - Can you see me? Hi. What should I do? - You're Elsa's father. - Yes. But I've never legally acknowledged her. It's happened before, we can rush the procedure. A fugitive has happened before? Not really. Look, no one will deny your right to be a donor for your daughter, but it all has to be official. Is that clear? - Yes? - It's me. I heard they've taken your phone. - Still like to read? - Sure do! Maybe you've read them... Thank you. I guess I did it for me too. - I've heard that before. - What? No, never mind. What is it? Mom told me... in jail, when... I mean, she was the one... who decided... I don't know. You know, I don't know? Maybe if she'd told me you both were outside waiting, I'd have toed the line. I'd have got out for good behavior, dunno! Maybe. What do you mean, maybe? Meaning maybe I'd have kept on being a jerk. I really don't know. Okay. Can I ask you something? Why rowing and not canoeing? - They said it was more complete. - You let them take the piss? You really like going backwards! - No... - Trust me, try canoes. All right. Promise? The removal of marrow went well. He's waking up. C'mon, tomorrow it's your turn. It's an absurd idea, even worse. - No matter. - Look, it's a crime. I can't think about that now. Excuse me, did you sign the form in the secretary's office? - No. - Come with me, only take a second. Come in. We have to go. Here. And on the other side. - What's going on? - Please, let us go. Please! It's easier than escaping from jail, eh? You're crazy. Now you can go. If it goes bad, you can always visit me in jail. If it goes good, I won't see you for awhile. Okay... I'm used to it. - Now go. - Yes. You're so slow! You go first. Cocky. Bye! Move, I have a week's vacation, not a month's! Yes, the coach was late! But the coach... - Changing the music. - Sure! It's something devastating. A gigantic explosion, a brilliant luminosity. The energy released can exceed that of an entire galaxy. Because that's exactly what happens to stars before they die: they release energy and change our universe. It's what they call a supernova.
