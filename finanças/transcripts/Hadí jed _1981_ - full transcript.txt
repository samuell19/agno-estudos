Serpent's Poison Marenka, come help me. Martinku Once again. Once again, twenty five. Soon you'll be a grandpa like me. Come here. How clumsy I am. C'mon, Anicka, not like this. When Martin was this high I always took him on my lap and he peed on me. He was one year old. Here, the photograph, see? That's terrible. Hold on, Martin, it won't last long. Come, we'd better dance. ...small shoes... My children! - What is it, grandma? - I'm too old for night life. But I wanted to give something to you to both of you Now you're 25. It'll come handy for the mountain trip. - You see, Vladenka? - Thank you. Grandma, thanks. - You're so lucky. - Martin, come help me. What did you say? Nothing. Only that you're so lucky. What about you Vladenka? What about your studies? Well... good. I'll be having my final high school exams this year. C'mon... At least let the child eat up. She'd like to know what you plan with our Martinek. What gossips we are. Our little orphan. It's exactly the opposite of what you said. Sorry, I can't read maps. Do you know how many kilometres we've driven... - in addition? - I'll give you the money for petrol. Don't be afraid That's really not what I meant. What do you mean then? Look, Vladenka... I know what you're thinking about. - 14 days of winter holiday... - Nobody has said how long it will be. You have to read the newspapers for that. I don't know what you expect. Such nonsense. Well... It's not nonsense for me. You don't even know how disappointed you could be. So many years. You never saw each other. You never wanted to. It's not like you need it. You know very well how my family likes you. It's you who don't need it. So many people around you, but what about me? Our little orphan. Sorry. Look, Martin. I think we're here. Wait. Listen to me, I won't leave you here alone. Martinek, now you listen to me and admit that it'll be better if I go there alone. How would he feel in front of a stranger? Who's a stranger here? Don't be angry and listen to me. Go back and I promise that as soon as things get bad or weird I'll come back too. But I have to handle this on my own. Don't you trust me? I do but I don't like it. Goodbye. Bye. Get out, Capak, what do you want here? - Matches. - Matches, sure, so you can burn something. Just go. Mad man. He only knows about ten words. Excuse me... can you let me know me, furtively as soon as the people are here? I have a message for one of them from Prague. I don't know what he looks like. Which is it supposed to be? The grandpa or the engineer? Vesely Jan. The engineer then. You see, and I thought it'd be Peta, he's into girls. Will you give me a signal, when they're here? Oh course I will. And I'd like to give a signal to you, Mr. Barta, that you've had a fifth beer. You know grandma doesn't like seeing you like this. - What would you like, Lojzik? - Chewing gum. You don't say. Here. Good bye. Hello Lojzik, man, going into pubs now? One beer. Andula, what food do you have? Hey, what's for dinner? Burgers and goulash. I think there's still some soup too. Miss. Miss, here they are. - Are you sick? - No, I'm fine. - Aren't you hungry? - What have you cooked for us today, Anca? - What do you want. - What do you think I want? You don't care, both of you. I'll let it go. - There's no wood either. - Look, some girl is looking at us. Girl... I tell you there's no wood and we can't have a fire. Miss, here they are. Did you hear that? There's no wood. What do you want to heat with? Pardon me, do you work here at the drill holes? Sure, miss, at the drill holes. So you've finally met. Miss has waited for you for such a long time. And? Is one of you... Jan Vesely? That would be me. So what? Mrs. Macova, such news, isn't it? - You have to be in the picture. - All you know is to be rude. I've looked for you for a long time. May I sit down? You're an engineer? This one? This one is a big shit. With PhD. at the end. What a joke! What do you want? Well... I promised to deliver a message to you. From Prague. From someone called Neckar. You know him, don't you? I don't. Mrs. Macova Give us four big ones. Are you from Prague? I am. We're on holiday right now. Winter ones. When I said to my acquaintances I was coming here Pepa gave me this address. And told me to say hello. But he didn't talk about an engineer. Maybe it's not you. It doesn't matter, miss. I'm no engineer. Neither am I the one who's supposed to be said hello to. But the barmaid told me that... So what'll it be? Shall we? Are you sleeping? The barmaid sent you some blankets. Thank you. - Do you need something else? -No. Get out and go look after your friends. Go. Listen. Does the man still drink so much? The engineer? He does everything properly. He's an engineer? Oh no, He was studying something but he didn't finish it. Whenever he's drunk he remembers he could've been an engineer, so we call him that. What's he like, otherwise? How, otherwise? I see... You should have told me, I'd have sent him here. Stop that obscenity! You could have found out right away. Screw your engineer! Screw you too. Dandy. How could I be so dumb? Back! You're here? What are you doing here? You said hello, so is there anything else? Lie down. Get in. I told you something completely different. Really? But why? Neckar doesn't say hello. When will the men come with the wood? Mrs. Novotna says hello. Vladimira. How come that you're supposed to say hello from Vladka I mean... from Mrs. Novotna? So. You know her? I do. I'm her daughter. You? You're really her daughter? I am. So, you're really the daughter of Vladka Novotna. The one who lives on Pankrac? Really. Does your mother know that you came here? I guess so, since she says hello. She doesn't. Mom died, it'll be a year now. So what do you want? Nothing... I only wanted to see you. I got the money from you. And when mom died, it was weird to take it. Since I didn't even know who sends it. I mean, I knew who... I didn't know what you look like. Nothing. So I told myself I'd come to see you. In order to see you. But I couldn't find you. And I wanted to say to you that after finishing my exams I'll find a job. So you don't have to send anything anymore. Are you crazy? Now, you'll need money even more. What was wrong with mom? She had the worst sickness. The worst at all. That's such a bad thing. What I'll only come into... You know what? Make some coffee, or tea there's a gas cylinder and a lighter, can you handle it? I'll get it. Can I put the fire on? Yes. So I have a daughter. That's not possible. What do you say? I've been waiting for you for five days. Too much work. - Why are you lying? - Wait... When will you come? I don't know, I'm really worried now, you know. I can see that. What the... I didn't know you ran a buffet here. I wish. I only know that you're drinking coffee here... I'm allowed to. And if you don't mind I put the fire on. What a way to behave. - How did you sleep? - Fine. Do you know you're not allowed in this area? No strangers are allowed here. And how do you know I'm a stranger? All the time he's drinking something Wild goings on then. It's interesting, that when you touch his things he goes mad. Do you know you have my cup? - Am I supposed to pour it out? - Oh no, I've taken his. You'll probably tell me that it's not my business but do you think there's some hope? What do you mean? You and the engineer. At the start he looked like he would... - for his whole life... - Let it be. But... after a while he's done with women. Stop it, he could be my dad. What are you doing here? There's a lot of work outside. Relax. You know, I'm entertaining miss here. So she won't be sad. Get out. Bastard. What's your name anyway? Vladimira. After mom. But I'm called Vladka. And will you stay here longer? We have the winter holiday. So far only 14 days but maybe we'll get longer. You know what? I'll finish it today and we'll have lunch somewhere. What an idea, eh? We'll see after that. Why are you staring? Well... I'm thinking What should I call you? It doesn't matter. Call me what you want to. Mrs. Macova make something special for us. From your own larder. I'll pay you later. If someone sees that I gave you alcohol so early there will be trouble. You should wait until evening. Especially after yesterday. Don't tell me you've never had a drink. Just a little. When I was 18. Me and Martin bought two bottles of French wine. Who's Martin? My boyfriend. He studies at a college. Economics. So you have a boyfriend. What do you actually... do now? Economics. But only a high school. I'm not good enough to go to college. If you have a talent it would be a waste. Whatever... Whatever I am I'd give you money. After all I never missed. You studied too. Why didn't you finish? There are rolls, is that OK? The old man will scold me. - Mrs. Macova? - What's up? Please... Do you have french wine? What? What for? Who would drink it here? I see, that's true. You know what? Go to the shop and buy two bottles of french wine and one for you. So you'll have a gourmet session and I'm opening in a while and I don't have any food for people. Why didn't you finish school? That's hard. When I learnt you were born mom didn't show you to me. Not at all. I wasn't allowed to see you. So I left school and went to work. But you can't understand that. God, don't make a fuss about it. So you told her to give it away. Even women say that. My mom kept me after all. So what? See, we've got wine. And here's the second one, let me cook now. And don't get drunk. People will be here any moment. Get to work. A toast to what? What do you think? A toast to that we'll be frank with each other. And that we'll ask everything of each other. And that we won't make a fuss of it. Don't make a fuss out of it. It's because I enjoy you being here. The main thing is that you enjoy it. But why do you drink so much? Don't be afraid, it'll be alright. I see you're engaged. You fool. She's my daughter. She looks like you. Bastard. What do you do with him when he's like this? We lay him on the bed. Wait here. Wait. Wait! Go away. It's not his fault. I understand him, he's too many troubles. No one else would last. I only had one glass. But he's been drinking it like water. He can't last too long like this. I'll put the fire on and bring another blanket. You won't freeze here. And tomorrow you'll sleep with dad. Me and Peta will sleep here. If he doesn't stay at the village with some girl - Will he wake up now? - Careful! Dad? Not today. Careful. Slippy, isn't it? - What about the boy? - As I said, he's not coming back. He went to take photos and he'll stay in the village, I guess. And the dog'll stay sitting there until morning? If his master won't get up he won't move. Hi, old man. Oh, yes. Hi, Vladka. Hello. Come and wash. I put some water on to boil. - Won't he bite me? - No. He bites only if I tell him. Come. Yesterday, I overdid it. Enough! I won't be able to fit my clothes. It's over now. Or just sensibly. Shit. I bought it for you yesterday. I'll have to throw it away. I guess I was sleeping on it. It's good enough. Youre nice. Look Vladka, I... sometimes drink. But I don't get drunk. I put all the money here. I didn't even know what for. But I said to myself maybe it'll come in handy. And now it does. You know what? Take it And tomorrow go to the city and buy something. It doesn't matter what. Well. For me in order to know it makes some sense. Here. You'll cheer me up. Fine, then. Look. A visitor. Peta. Take it for a moment. Good day. Where's Honza? I don't know. He was here a while ago. What do you want from him? I'm not telling you what I want from him. I did it too for him. And before me, another woman did it. There'll be another woman doing his laundry after you. There's probably a misunderstanding. You did Mr. Vesely's laundry? Not only that. You know, I'm doing the laundry for my dad. You're not so mistaken. Look at yourself. He really could be your father. What a bother, eh? Did she say something? Not really. She just was a little bit weird. There'll be the old man's foil speciality today. They dated? With the woman? I'm not spreading rumours. You can tell me. I don't care, he's an adult. Ask him yourself. Can't you take off your old boots? Can't you see she's cleaned in here? You treat everywhere like a pig sty. I didn't notice. Just go. Men, it'll be done. Slice the bread, meanwhile. What a smell! Thanks. Here take it. Is there a milk bottle? Sure, there's plenty of bottles here. But not from milk. There. It's nicer here, isn't it? It is. It's completely different. It'll blossom by Christmas. You'll see. Will someone help me, or not? I'm coming. What a girl! You fool. Do you believe I could be faithful to such a girl? Really. Totally faithful. Let's get things straight. I know you, Peta. If you think... of trying something with the girl... Then what? I'll beat you up. Do you understand? Here it is. What a great meal. It's like on a trip here. Something's missing, right? Geez, how cold it is... Do you have one more? Honza, don't play the fool. One beer won't kill me. Will it, Ladka. Well, I'll have one myself. Two, then. This is for both of you, this one is for the old man. That's alright, I'll have what remains. Just play. You can't sleep in this. I only took it because of the cold. Here, this one is clean. The trousers will flap a little but it will do. Shall I sleep here? Yes. Well... The old man sleeps down here and Peta up top. I sleep there. This blanket is completely new. Thanks. Won't it bother them to sleep elsewhere? Oh, no. It's a change for them. Peta sleeps there always when they have a visitor. The old man has slept there too. He sometimes snores terribly. Play something for me. And sit down here, will you? Who does your laundry? It varies. There are laundry rooms, right? What should I play? What's your favourite? When you're travelling around stop by. I'll give you a flower of amaranth. A flower, a green one, if you're so honest come to me. A flower, a green one, if you're so honest come to me. Mom loved this. Good night, Vladka. I don't feel like sleeping. We don't have to sleep. A woman was searching for you here today. Blanka, I guess. She was sad because you weren't here. Don't be mad, it's none of my business, I just It's just for you to know she was here. I'm not a man who should be with a woman. She would be sadder if I were with her. Even if she looks for me. How come? Everyone needs someone, right? D'you want to stay alone forever? I don't know. It's weird anyway. You're young. Healthy. I won't be young forever. Nor healthy. And there's money only ocasionally. That's not so important. You could have lived somewhere in the city. To have your flat you know. Everything. What's in the city? I always ran away from it. Here I am free. I'll do my job and nobody watches over me. But a man needs some hapiness. At least a little. That's right. You're here. That's enough for me. But I'll have to leave some time. Right. What can one do. Good night. I'll be right back. I'll get some cigarettes. He's full of shit, he's going to have a drink. I was just trying it. That's alright. I didn't want to come in with these boots on. Be so kind, my cigarettes are in the closet. In the other one. At the top. But there's nothing here. What a mess. - The old man doesn't have any neither. - I'll get you some then. - Would you be so kind? - Sure. Can he go with me? Get up, you're going for a walk with miss. Come! - You forgot to tell me which ones? - Laikas, I guess. Or whatever they have. That's it. Great. Number one. - Now, sit down. - Wait. Like this. Leave the coat like that. Yes, yes. Perfect. Great. It's stuck. It's good, let's go. With my dad, too. Maybe it would be fine for you to come live with me in Prague. I've told you I don't like the city. You don't even know if we'd get along. - I do, maybe you'd finish school too. C'mon. How did you figure it out? Just so, I think it could be wonderful. Vladimira, you two were alone all the time? When I was little, we were. I envied every girl having a dad. Mom told me you were far away and that you earn money there. Sometimes she bought me a toy and told me it's from you. Then an uncle moved in with us. And mom told me you'd died. I always bothered her with dad... Daddy, daddy... What else was she supposed to say to me? The uncle, his name was Prokop, He was alright. But when mom got sick he got rather nervous, worried how he'd ended up. And when mom returned from the hospital dear uncle had disappeared. Mom was devastated, she cried terribly. And then she told me... That you were alive. I came to life, right? Now, pay attention. Is it allowed? What do you think? Is it allowed? Clever rascal. What's his name? He has no name. That's impossible. It is. He's a foundling. He was tied to a tree. So I untied him. Since then he hasn't left me. I take him everywhere with me. Poor thing. We got used to each other. And you, when you'd figure out we get along would you go with me then? We could take him with us. Martin would train him. He's good with wolfhounds. You see, you have Martin. You'll get married and what about me? What do you say? What a size, eh? Wonderful. Hold this. Is it really allowed? Not really. Come. Come. It's like office hours for you, Mr. Vesely. - One? - Yes. Bad luck. Nice one, around 1 kg. I really understand you. But you have to pardon me. My daughter has arrived. - The only one. - Daughter, right? Really, unexpectedly. I wouldn't have had anything for dinner. I'm thinking, Vesely. Wouldn't it be cheaper in the restaurant? Can you prepare a carp? Sure I can. Who else would cook at my place? You know what? Go ahead, prepare the carp and I'll take care of something. - Can't I go with you? - No, just go. Home! Come then. - That's great. - It's just... Where have you left your dad? He said he needed to take care of something. We'll have fish. Dad caught it for a hundred. Wait, I don't know what kind of preparation do you like. Lojza, get up, do you hear? Get up. We can cover for you at work, but it's something else here. Imagine what a nice girl I have. I have a girl so nice she wants me to live with her in Prague. She's simply a golden girl. You've celebrated it quite enough. So let's go. Wait, don't shout at me. Mrs. Macova Give me and my pals four big ones. - Let's go. - A moment. Leave it here and come. Let's go. Do whatever you want to me, you fools. Vladenka. We're home now. My little girl. Vladenka. Move. I had a little drink, and why not. You don't have to behave like that because of it. Are you mad? I drink my own money. Did you give me money for it? Have I done anything to her? Wait, tell me, have I done anything to you? Go away. Why did he drink so much? He said he'd come right away. Can someone get drunk in such a short time? I don't understand it. To ruin your life this way. I know. He's unhappy. So these are the fairy tales he's been telling you? If every unhappy man drank like him there would be drunkards everywhere. But he's not a drunkard. You can't tell the difference, then. But something can be done, right? You can do just one reasonable thing. Pack your things and go home. Because you can't do anything for him. - He doesn't want to. - I'm not going anywhere. I don't believe he wouldn't stop because of me. I won't be there with him. Why won't you go to the cinema? I'm not in the mood. Don't be mad. It wasn't that terrible. Dad, you're so nice. You can stop it, right? Do you know how I feel when I see you how those two drag you He didn't have to. You couldn't even crawl in here. Look, Vladka, you don't understand. I have to drink sometimes and nobody should interfere. Do you even know how I've lived? Do you know why I drink? I was in a similar situation, to yours. But whenever I drank I forgot all my problems. But... you're still too young to understand. You've gone through too little. That's what you think. I don't like it when someone organizes my life. But dad, I don't want you to organize anything. I only pity that you can't be without it. I know it's none of my business. But I can't let it go because you're my dad. You're fine otherwise. I know you can blame mom or your life. I could have started drinking too. But I don't. You're still a silly girl. I've had a completely different life to you. Look, you had your mom and the only thing you missed was dad. You had people around you. You would have people around you too, if you didn't drink. And if I'm silly because I'm telling you to stop it then I'm silly. I just can't let it go. You can try. I've tried already. It was useless. I've tried it many times. I've always lasted for a fortnight. And then it begins again. Who hasn't lived through it can't understand it. Try it once again dad. Because of me. Alright. I'll try. I knew you were great. I had to know how to repair everything on my own. Mom was very thrifty. My deceased wife made it. Twelve years ago. - Do you have someone? - A daughter. And a grand-daughter. My daughter is divorced. As soon as I earn something here I'll move in with them. I mustn't to go there empty handed. That's really important to have a place to go when you're old. They'll be pretty excited when you plant yourself there. Relax. My daughter is pulling me in there right now. - I bet she does. - She writes it in every letter. Because they can smell the money. You're an idiot. You've known my dad for a long time, haven't you? Well, for a long time... Do you think he'll stop? He promised it. We'll see. You've seen it already, haven't you? Or are you blind? I don't know if I love him more or if I pity him more. What do you think he'll do if I leave? He'd be sad, I guess. Sad... You'd give him a great reason for drinking. At least I'd like to know if he loves me. Sometimes I start to be afraid of him. On the other hand I'm glad I have him. Thank you. I think he loves you. But that it hasn't got through to him yet. He's still surprised. From your unexpected appearance. What should I do. That's hard to say. At least wait for a while. And when something happens, go away. With or without pity, go away, and leave him to it. Old man! Nice doggy. You're sure nice. Quiet. - Where are you going? - To take some photos. Good night. He's so into it, isn't he? Him? He's only into one old rabbit. Fuck off, bastard. What's up? What I suspected. I told you. Did I tell you or not? You're a chatter-box, don't tell Vladka. Am I an idiot? Well then, engineer, was it there? Mind your own business. What it'll be? Strudel. Do you like it? It's awkward for me. I'd like for you not to be disappointed. Daddy's not doing so good. The old man caught him drinking again. And why are you, telling me this? When the old man saw him? Old man. Have you seen dad drinking? Peta told me. What an idiot. Where is he now? Where do you think? Good evening. Hello, Vladenka. Sit down. No, thank you. - We'll go, shall we? - Yes. Just sit down. Have something. Miss, what will you have? It's on me. A moment One moment, gentlemen It's none of your business. She's my daughter, right? Come, dad, please. Wait, shift yourself. Come here and have something. It's on me. You're such a bastard. - Why? - I haven't seen such a bastard in my whole life. You know what it cost him and you say such rubbish. So what, it's true. If he gets drunk in a cottage or a restaurant, it doesn't matter, does it? But you're talking him into it. You simply can't see anyone around you who does something for others. And not only because of themselves. Nonsense. To stop drinking because of someone. - To quit because of someone. - Everyone does it for themselves. Me too. - You envy the others. - Envy what? That we do things because of other people. Old man, you're a philosopher, I didn't know that. You promised me you'd stop. It's hardly a week. C'mon, Vladka. Last shot And off we go. You know what? I'll wait outside. But only for a moment. You've gone mad. That's why you told the girl. I'll arrange it. Be sensible. Do you want to catch a cold? Go back and get warm. I'll bring him. Thank you. Don't cry. Every drop is in vain here. I'm mad at myself for being so dumb. You're so nice. And look what he is. I don't know why I'm still here. Tomorrow I'm out of here and he can rot in a ditch. Open up. Do you hear me? Open up! Vladka. Open up. For God's sake open up. Vladenka. - Tell her, please. - Come lie down. Tell her I love her. Stop it and go to sleep. You'll tell her in the morning. - In the morning. - Right now. Right now I'll tell her. - What am I supposed to do with him? - I love you Vladka. I love you. Can you hear me? Open up. Open up! Open up, or I'll destroy the bloody chalet. What friends you are. What friends you are. You're cowards. Cowards. Come out to see I'm perfectly alright. Honza, come. - Who told her? - What? Who told her I'd gone to the restaurant? Don't be mad, hands off, I'm sensitive about this. - Come to sleep. - I'm not in the mood for sleeping. I'll be sitting here. For the whole night. I'll be sitting and begging here. I'll be begging her. Vladenka, Vladenka, your father is begging you. Can you hear me? Vladenka... Alright. You wanted it. Humiliate me. Tread on me. Step on me. I'll be kneeling here. I don't want to see you anymore, dad. Let me be. Let me be. - Do you hear? Let me be. - Vladenka... You don't like anyone. - Where are you running, Vladka? - You only think about yourself. Egoist! Get out! - I tell you, get out of the car. - Let me be! What are you doing? Fuck off, you! What do you w... you bastard. I'll kill you. Don't be mad. Let him be. I'm telling you simply. Be sensible. I don't know about you but I'm done here. Go away, go. We can't leave him here like this. Drunken pig. Let's go pack up. Fuck you. Both. The only thing left is for you to run away. Subtitles by kostej (2012)
