[upbeat suspenseful music] - [David] Dr. David Lazarus, you're on the air. - [Caller] Yeah, Doc. - [David] Yes. - [Caller] I'm a big fan of yours. I been listening to your show for a while, man. - [David] What's on your mind? - [Caller] Listen, I got a problem. - [David] Yeah. - [Caller] My wife, you know how you got out and you play and stuff, you know? And you want your wife to look real hot for you. - [David] Right. Well, I think I know what you mean. - [Caller] My wife, man, she don't wanna dress up the way I want her to dress up. - [David] What do you want her to wear? - [Caller] Well, I'd like to wear hot things. - [David] Like what, for instance? - [Caller] Like garter belts, man, some little leather, some chains, stuff like that, you know. - [David] Yeah, and what's the problem? - [Caller] She says that it makes her feel like a whore when she dress up like this. - [David] Well, isn't that idea? [upbeat rock music] [group chattering] [upbeat rock music] [punch striking] [group chattering] [engine starting] [siren blaring] - [Officer] All right, break it up. Break it up! Go inside or go home! You, with the blue hair, you wanna go to jail? Get off the street. - [Caller] He's a virgin. - [David] A virgin? - [Caller] Yeah, that doesn't bother me. I mean, I don't have to worry about diseases and things. But, um-- - [David] Why is he a virgin? How long have you been going out with him? - [Caller] Four months. He's having a problem getting an erection, and that's bothering me. I mean he seems to be able to get one any time except when we're in bed. - [David] Has there been any sexual activity at all? - [Caller] Oh yeah, yeah, lots. - [David] Lots? - [Caller] He's really super. - [David] What's he afraid of? I mean, if he can have an erection, and he won't have intercourse with you, what's he afraid of? - [Caller] Maybe he's afraid of commitment, or a serious relationship, marriage. - [David] Someone who's maybe a little overbearing? [horn honking] - [Caller] Me? I'm not overbearing? - [David] Did you ever think of saying, hey, I'm very frustrated with this relationship? You seem to be able to have an erection anytime you want except when I want it. Well, you talk to him about that, okay? See, as long as he doesn't work this out, he doesn't have to make a commitment. Start being honest, you know, start being real. - [Caller] So you think I should just seize the moment and? - [David] So to speak. Why don't you try that? Okay call me back and let me know what happens, all right? - [Caller] Okay. [beeping] - [David] Dr. D., you're on the air. - [Edward] Lazarus, I'm a traveler, going from one place to another. In between. I have the power to change things, Lazarus. [engine roaring] - [David] I see. What is it that you would like change? - Idiot, go around. [Edward praying in Latin] [cars colliding] - [David] Try to keep your comments in English. This is David Lazarus, you're on the air. - [Tom] Yeah, Doc. This is Tom, calling you from New York. When I was 13 ... - [David] Is that a long story? [gun firing] [tires squealing] [shrieking] - Put her in the circ. Another thousand of D-5, and the whole nine yards. I don't think there's a pulse. - Her melon's frapped, man. We shoulda pronounced her at the scene, saved a lotta trouble. - [EMT] You can take your time on this one, Doc. - [Doctor] Call respiratory. Let's try to get a tube into this patient. Mary, give me a thoracotomy tray and a central line set up. - [Mary] Let's get her on the monitor. - [Doctor] No pulse, no pressure. Never mind an airway. - [Mary] Cancel the code? - [Doctor] Yeah, she's pronounced, 1601. [water running] - You okay, Sunny? - Yeah, Mary, I'm fine. - Denise and J.J. just got here. You wanna go on home and let me hand over? - Thanks, I'd appreciate that. - These car accidents are the worst. I really hate it when they come in like that. - That was no car accident. - [Ricardo] Okay, you'll be coming up next, so stand by, right. - Hello, you're on the air. - [Edward] The faithful martyr is a slave. But the beast has arisen to smite down the wicked, the fornicators, the guilty. - Sir, you're quoting the Bible, which is fine, but do you have a question? For a minute there, I thought our airspace was invaded by Jerry Falwell. - [Edward] Lazarus, you have told the faithful to accept what is real, the truth. I am the truth, and I am fulfilling the prophecy. - That's interesting, sir. What's your name? - The time of the great purge is at hand [speaks Latin]. - Excuse me, sir. [Edward speaking Latin] We'll take more of your calls after this. Guy sounds like Cardinal Spellman on acid. [soft saxophone music] [laughing] - Another one. Right. I got a million of them. You wrapped this, didn't you? I could tell [laughs]. [soft saxophone music] How beautiful. It even fits.

[soft music] [gun firing twice] [TV static] [soft dramatic music] [TV static] [phone ringing] [horn honking in distance] - Hello. - [J.J.] Sunny, it's J.J. - Yeah, hi, J.J.? - [J.J.] Oh, did I wake you? - That's okay. What'd you find out? - [J.J.] You were right about that DOA, another gunshot victim. - Yeah? It was? - [J.J.] Her name was Laura Norris. She was 18. - Did you see the report? - [J.J.] Yeah, the bullet went clear through, but they ID'd the weapon type anyway. 44 caliber. - It was? - [J.J.] Just like before. Anything else I can do for you, Sunny? - No, I'm all right. - [J.J.] Okay, we'll see you at work. - Yeah, thanks, J.J. [traffic passing] [phone ringing] - Yeah, Boyle here. Yes, Mrs. Harper. Can you hold on for a minute please? - She's calling about this. - We should put this broad on the payroll. Mrs. Harper, like I told you before, we're doing everything we possibly can. - Some son of a bitch is driving around out there killing people. - Look, there's 600 miles of freeway in LA, over 600,000 crazies in cars, lots of them have guns. Your calling every day does not make the process go any faster. - Well it doesn't make it go any slower, Lieutenant Boyle. - Whatever you say, Mrs. Harper. [sighing] - It's been almost a year, Sunny. When do you think you'll be ready to let it go? - When they catch the son of a bitch. - We're talking about things that you can control. - I can't control the dreams. I can't pretend it didn't happen. - I don't think you're hearing me. What can you do? What can you do for Sunny? - I need a refill on my prescription, Carol. I can't sleep without it. [soft dramatic music] [gun firing] [gun firing] [computer beeping] [workers chattering] - It's her, I know it is. She's on that soap "Yesterday and Tomorrow." - Another TV star in for detox? - Should I ask her for her autograph? - Wait a couple of days. - Girl, you at it again? Well you better wrap it up. Renfield wants you in OR immediately. - Thanks, Mary, I'll be right up. - Better watch out, Sunny. You're gonna end up over there with "Yesterday and Tomorrow." - [Sunny] I knew it. [soft suspenseful music] [phone dialing] - Dr. D. - [Edward] Lazarus. Ready for you to bear witness to my power, the beast, now ascends us. Remember, I'll give my power to my two witnesses. Power to turn the great street crimson with blood. - [David] Sir, what meaning do those words have for you? - [Edward] That if any man hurt them, fire, beseech their mouth and devour us. - Cut him off. Cut him off. - [Edward] It's time for them to pay, Lazarus. I'm meting out judgment, swift and sure. - Go to a spot. David, are you out of your fucking mind? What the hell was that? - [DJ] Hey, LA, we'll be back with more music from the four right after the news. - [Reporter] Another outbreak of freeway violence in Los Angeles last night. A 42-year-old man whose identity is being withheld was pronounced dead at the scene at 2:11 this morning. The attack occurred on the northbound 405 near the Mulholland exit. This latest murder brings the toll to 13 dead since the freeway killings began about this time last year. CHP officers arrived before the gunshot but were unable to-- [tires squealing] Law officers are out in full force patrolling the sections where the shootings occurred. And a special task force headed by LAPD Lieutenant Jack Boyle has been assigned to coordinate activities among the various sleuths, but they remind all LA travelers, as ever, to observe caution. Some motorists and roadside homeowners are shopping for bulletproof glass. [horn honking] [tires squealing] [cars crashing] - Shoot. - [Reporter] One patrolman was quoted as saying, it's a shame it takes something like this to get drivers to be nice to each other. - Dammit, where'd you get your driver's license, out of a crackerjack box? Son of a bitch, I just drove this thing off the lot! What the hell's the matter with you, lady? Jesus Fucking Christ! I hope you got this shit box insured. - I have insurance. - Why is it every time I get into a wreck it's with a goddam lemon? - I'll take that. Write fast. Get lost. You all right? - Yes. It was my fault. [birds chirping] I thought that guy was gonna bite my head off. - You're gonna have to tow it. - Really? That bad, can't drive it? - I wouldn't. I can drive you to a service station if you want. - Um, it's okay. I think I can make it. [birds chirping] [engine starting] [slow guitar music] [horn honking] [slow guitar music] - So how bad is it? - Well, you've come to the right place. Why don't we go into my office? I'll take down your particulars. [slow guitar music] [drill whirring] - How long will it take? - Some body work takes longer than others, if you get my meaning. - Known to his fans as Dr. Dave, has stated that, should the man call again-- - Miss? Miss? Ma'am. - [gasps] Oh, sorry. - I need your name. - Sunny. Sarah Harper. - Oh, I like Sunny better. That's the way I like my eggs, sunny side up, if you get my meaning. - Would you have a car that I could use while mine's being fixed? - I don't have loaners. But I will show you my rental department. [engine sputtering] - I can't drive this. - It's a little dirty, but I'll get it started. - What about that one over there? - The Firebird? That's my personal car. No way. [engine lurching] [soft guitar music] [shouting] No. [tires squealing] [engine racing] - [Woman] Oh yeah, rub it. Uh-huh, oh caress me, right there. Oh yeah. Keep squeezing me tighter. [tires squealing] Oh yeah. Oh baby. Oh, that's so nice. Oh, oh, oh. [slow guitar music] - Excuse me, ma'am, may I help you? - Hey, lady. - Working late tonight, Lieutenant Boyle? - Hello, Mrs. Harper, it's always good to see you. - I hope you're working on a new lead. There was another shooting tonight on the freeway, wasn't there? What are you gonna do about it? - Mrs. Harper, I put in a 12-hour shift today. I'd like to get home to my family. - You're not gonna do anything, are you? What about this guy that's been calling the radio shrink? - You know, lady, you're unbelievable. - You're just gonna sit there and let him kill whoever he wants to? - I'm gonna tell you for the last time, this is police business, and I don't need you telling me how to do my job. Gomez, can you show Mrs. Harper to the door? - That won't be necessary, Gomez. - [David] Why did she join the Army, sir? - [Caller] She said that she was tired of living around a loser, a man with no dreams and no desires. - [David] She was talking about you? - [Caller] Yes. - [David] Uh-huh, and you have children? - [Caller] Yes. - [David] Calm down. Calm down. - [Caller] Little John, who's going on, who's going on three years. - [David] Does he know where his mother is? - [Caller] He think's Mama's bye-bye. - [David] Uh-huh. Well, is she gonna come back? - Honey, I'm really sorry. The deposition took light-years. Jesus. No, no, I'm sorry, baby. Some guy is climbing up my rear, and now he's flashing his brights. Okay, just keep it warm. I'll be home in 20 minutes or so. I love you too. Getting a little tired of this game, moron. [dramatic music] - [David] Did she leave you or did she just join the Army? [upbeat dramatic music] [tires squealing] - You son of a bitch. - [Caller] I have a life. - Oh my God. Goddammit. Yes, get me the police. - Lieutenant, I think we got some trouble here. - What's going on? - I've got some nut on the phone. - [Driver] Do you hear me? This maniac is trying to run me off the road! - If you'd calm down, sir, we might be able to help. Now what's your exact location? - Let's get a trace on it. - Somewhere between LA and Bakersfield. Yes, the I-5, now get somebody out here now, dammit! [cars colliding] [dramatic music] [tires squealing] [car crashing] - The Dr. Lazarus show, your first name. Hello. - [Edward] Lazarus, tell the lost souls of Babylon, I am here. [gun firing] I will wipe away your tears from your eyes and take away the pain [fires gun], sorrow. [gun firing] Behold, I make all things new [fires gun]. And the dead bodies lie in the great street of the city, which spiritually is called Sodom. - That's from the Book of Revelations. I suppose you think there's no greater Sodom than our own City of Angels. - [Edward] You are able to appreciate the humor in that, Lazarus, but then you use humor so well. You wield it like a sword. - I'm not laughing now. I wanna understand. - [Edward] Since we last spoke, what have you learned, my prophet? - [David] Your passages are from Revelations, Chapter 11, and that verse goes on to say that when the great city fell men 7,000 were slain and the remnant were afrighted. - [Edward] The wicked are frightened, yes. - Do you see yourself destined to slay those men as the beast? - [Edward] I'm but a servant. You understand me, don't you, Lazarus? - [David] No, but I'm trying. - [Edward] I will call again. - Wait, isn't there something you want, a way to stop this? - [Edward] The children of Sodom cannot petition fate. [exhaling] - Shit. - Shit, where's my wallet? [soft piano music] [Sarah moaning] - [Sarah] No! [knocking on door] [soft piano music] [knocking on door] [soft piano music] - I was expecting someone else. - I thought you might need this. - My wallet. Thanks, I couldn't remember what I did with it. - Are you all right? - Yeah, I'm all right. I'm fine. - Well, good night. - Good night. [soft piano music] [phone ringing] Hello. - [Frank] Are you alone? - Who is this? - [Frank] I had this feeling that you didn't want me to leave. I wanna see you. Would you like that? - Yes, I ... [line going dead] [soft mysterious music] Oh! [soft mysterious music] [soft romantic music] [soft mysterious music] - Time of the new Babylon, who will live and who will die? I have the power to choose. - How do you decide, and what gives you the right? - [Edward] I am informed by a higher power. The voices tell me. - Get him off, goddammit. Laz, Laz, I'm warning you. [tires squealing] - [Edward] They had two horns like a ram and yet he spake like a dragon. And the angels cried out, trust in thy sickle and reap. The time has come for thee to reap. The harvest of the Earth is ripe. [soft dramatic music and vocalizing] [gun firing] [glass smashing] [gun firing and glass smashing] [gun firing] [gun firing] - Hello, Dr. David Lazarus please. No, I don't wanna talk on the air. Well does he have an office number or something? Look, I'll call back later, thanks. - Their vacations rudely interrupted by a hail of bullets. While driving north on the Harbor Freeway, an unidentified gunman drove alongside their car and began firing. When we talked to the Clay family, they were still very shaken by the attack. - I don't mind telling you, John. It was the most horrible experience of my entire life. Now my only concern is how all this is going to affect my children. - It's a miracle we're still alive. It was such a shock. You see, we'd just spent the die sightseeing and we were driving along the freeway. - [John] This is John Mitchell reporting from Pasadena. [family chattering] - Okay, wait a second. Hold on a minute. Let me get this straight. You thought he had long, crazy-looking hair like an old hippie? - That's right. - And you thought he was a punk-like kid? And you're sure he was Black? - He was. - What about the car? - Too hard to tell. It all happened so fast. - Thanks very much for your help. Good night. - Good night. - Good night. [family chattering] [traffic passing] - Hey. I wanna talk to you. - What are you doing here? - Look, let's go somewhere and talk. - Who are you? - All right, my name's Quinn, Frank Quinn. - You didn't just happen by the accident the other day, did you? - No, I didn't. - What do you want? - The same thing you want. - What are you, some kinda cop? - I was once. - You sure have a funny way of conducting an investigation. [knocking on window] - I wanna help you. - I don't believe you. [engine starting] - Why are you asking me, Lieutenant? Nobody got my approval to put a tap on my phone lines. Talk to my boss. - I did. You know what he told me? He told me he can't control you. He also told me if you didn't have such high ratings you'd be out in the street. - That's Morrie for you, never lets his moral outrage get in the way of his good business sense. I thought you wanted me to keep this guy on the line as long as possible so you could run your trace. - Look, Dr. Lazarus, do me a favor, will you? Just talk to him, but keep him off the air, you understand? - Lieutenant, this schizo thinks he's in the middle of a cosmic catastrophe. He's gonna tell the world about it. - I don't give a shit what he thinks, and you're the one he's calling. - He has a fixation with me because I'm on the radio. - That's your problem. Just keep him the hell off. Jesus Christ, I don't fucking believe it. - Lieutenant? - How are you, Mrs. Harper? What brings you here? - I was just about to ask you the same thing. - Remember what I told you, Doctor. Excuse me. - What is this, visitors day? I got a show to do. - You think he's tough? Wait till she starts breaking your balls. [sighing] [reporter chattering] - [Caller] What you did is reprehensible. You have no business talking to a murderer. - Sir, did my mother put you up to this or what? - [Caller] Your mother? What-- - Thank you for your opinion, sir. Mrs. Harper, I told the police everything I know. I've done all I can. - Have you? - Hey, I'm a radio personality. The cops got their own shrinks on this. Talk to them. - No, I wanna talk to you. - [David] Why? - Because you're the only one in direct contact with the killer. - You know, Mrs. Harper, maybe you should get your own show. - You're supposed to be here to help people. You're nothing but a hypocrite. - Ricardo, aren't there any sexually hung-up teenagers or miserable divorcees out there today? - I've got a suicidal grandmother, a yuppie doper and a middle-aged obsessive-compulsive. Everything else is about your freeway friend. - Mrs. Harper, the show's over in about an hour and a half. You wanna come back? - That's okay. I'll wait. - Give me the suicidal grandma. - [Sunny] This is Sunny. I'm not home, so wait for the tone and leave a message. Bye. - Yeah, Miss Harper? It's Ronnie, from Ronnie's Garage. I've got your car ready, and I'm looking for my Firebird. - [David] So, Mrs. Harper, is their an explanation to your obsessive nature? - My husband was a victim of a freeway killer. - I'm sorry. I didn't know. - But you do know who the killer is, don't you? - Why would I know that? - Because he's calling you. - Look, Mrs. Harper, I understand your interest in this, but I don't wanna get involved, really. - No, I didn't think you would. - Mrs. Harper, wait a minute. Have you checked the files at Camarillo? - No, what for? - Hypervectorial disorders, paranoid schizos with a history of violence, chronic AWOLs over the past two years, you know. - No, I don't know. - Well, according to your research, the time between attacks has been steadily diminishing. - Yeah, so? - Well, that could mean our guy has a type of disorder that's progressive but sporadic, and the fact that he's now gone on a full rampage indicates an acute schizophrenic cataclysm. - Why Camarillo? - Well, I'd say he has no family. He's totally alienated. If he were arrested during an outbreak of uncontrolled behavior he'd be thrown into a state facility. - Anything else? - Yeah, one of my listeners called up and told me that the Latin quotations are from an old mass for the dead. - You mean the killer could be a priest? - More likely an ex-priest. [soft mysterious music] - Monsignor Cavanaugh? I'm Sarah Harper. Father Garrity said you might be able to help me. I'm looking for someone who left the church, maybe an ex-priest, possibly somebody from your diocese. Father Garrity said that you'd be the one most familiar with these names. Donald Whalen, John D. Barbieri, Daniel Saunders, Andrew Dunn, Floyd Ramden, Joseph Cerrito, Douglas McDonald. Monsignor Cavanaugh, can you hear me? [soft music] Father Sidney Smith. John O'Connor, Father Heller. Oliviero, Willis, Manetti, Dravasi. Okay, Monsignor. Thanks anyway. [soft music] - [Edward] Another beast coming up out of the Earth. He had two horns like a ram and yet he spake like a dragon. - Names he cried out. - Names he cried out. - Thrust in thy sickle and reap. - Monsignor, do you recognize that voice? - Now is the time for thee to reap, for the harvest of the Earth is ripe. Oh, Father Eddie could always recite Revelations so beautifully. - Father Eddie? Do you know that voice? Is that Father Eddie? - Father Ferrara knew Ecclesiastes by heart. And when it came to the Apostles, well it was Father Barrett hands down. But, of course, when it came to Revelations, they belonged exclusively to Father Raponi. - Father Raponi? What about Father Eddie? - I saw a woman upon a scarlet-colored beast, full of names of blasphemy and abominations, having 10 heads and 10 horns. And I saw a woman bludgeoned with the blood of the saints and the blood of the martyrs! And the 10 horns took their swords upon the beast, thee shall hate the horn. And shall eat her flesh, and shall burn her with fire! [soft dramatic music] - [Monsignor On Tape] Father Eddie would always recite Revelations so beautifully. [tape screeching] Father Eddie-- Father Eddie would always recite-- Father Eddie would-- Father Eddie would always recite-- Father Eddie would always recite-- Father Eddie would-- - [Reporter] We interrupt this program to bring you a K Action news bulletin. We take you now to Rosanne Rivera. - I'm reporting to you live from the scene of the latest freeway shooting. Details are sketchy at this time, but we do know that a teenage girl has been killed. Her identity is being withheld pending notification of her relatives. I also wanna remind you that tomorrow afternoon I will be presenting a special report focusing on the families of freeway shooting victims. Lieutenant, what new information do you have regarding this recent outbreak of freeway violence? - I really have nothing to say at the present time. - What about the calls made to radio psychiatrist David Lazarus during the shootings? - I have no comment on that. - And the rumor that the radio station has a live recording of the incident? - I said no comment. - Lieutenant, are the police departments doing anything at all to deal with this situation? - [Jack] We're doing everything we possibly can. - Good afternoon, I'm Rosanne Rivera with a special report on the recent rash of freeway killings. All of my guests here today share a common bond, a tragic bond. [chattering] And finally, Sarah Harper, all have lost a family member to a freeway sniper. Now, Mrs. Harper, when you and I spoke earlier, you expressed your theory that the most recent rash of freeway shootings was committed by a single gunman. - Lieutenant? - Huh? - Take a look at this. - [Rosanne] That killed your husband Robert nearly 11 months ago. - Yes, until recently, the police had been saying that all the freeway attacks were random and unrelated. Well, I had trouble accepting that. - Fucking broad. - [Sunny] Doing some research on my own. - [Rosanne] And you feel the killer is the man who has been calling radio psychiatrist David Lazarus? - Yes I do. This man is a plague on society. He's a vicious monster that must be stopped. Despite the fact that he's been broadcasting his shootings, till now the police haven't even been able to trace his calls. And even though the murders occurred in public places, on the freeway, with millions of cars packed all around, no one has seen anything. [soft suspenseful music] [doorknob clicking] [soft suspenseful music] [hard breathing] [lock clicking] [door creaking] [dramatic music] [gun firing] [phone dialing] [soft suspenseful music] - [David] Dr. D, you're on the air. - [Edward] Lazarus, I must tell you about my next sacrifice. Oh, such a big red machine. For such a frail angel. Golden hair's like a halo. - [David] Let her go. There have been enough sacrifices. [suspenseful music] - Oh my God. [tires squealing] [engines racing] - She thinks she can fly away, but I'll take whoever I want. - Like fucking hell you will! [engines racing] [brakes squealing] [dramatic music] [tires squealing] [dramatic music] [tires squealing] [dramatic music] [suspenseful music] [tires squealing in distance] [tires squealing] - [Frank] Get down! [gun firing] [gun firing] [dramatic music] [engine starting] [tires squealing] [dramatic music] [tires squealing] [dramatic music] [gun firing] [gun firing] [siren blaring] [tires squealing] [siren blaring] [cars colliding] [sirens blaring] - Okay, put the gun on the seat! Spread 'em. [dramatic music] [music stops] - Quinn. Boyle wants to see you upstairs. - You know I don't have to give these back to you. I can't cover your ass anymore, Frank. Look, I know you wanna pick up the $25,000 CHP reward, but do me a favor, will you? Keep your bounty hunter bullshit outta my precinct. - Where's my car? - It's impounded. [chattering] Quinn, I'm warning you. You fuck up again, you're on your own. I mean it, Frank. And you. I'm putting a 24-hour watch on your apartment. That's just in case. Mrs. Harper, I don't know what your involvement is with Frank Quinn, but let me fill you in on a few things. See, Frank was a good cop. Honest, nice family. He, uh, he made detective two years on the force. Silver Cross. But Frank liked to do things his own way. That's his problem. See, he, um, he was working narcotics. He was on this one case for months. I guess you could say he became obsessed with it. I warned him he was getting too close to the situation, but he ignored me. Night before Frank was gonna bust these bastards, he comes home. And this is what he found left of his wife and little girl. Two weeks after the incident, we find five dead Colombians downtown, same ones that were connected to his operation. Three days later, Frank resigned, no questions asked. There was no investigation. [soft saxophone music] [siren blaring in distance] [soft saxophone music] [exhaling] [soft saxophone music] - [Frank] I wanna help you. [knocking on door] [door creaking] - What do you want? - Can I come in, to talk? - Why not? - Frank, I got something to explain. - No, you got nothing to explain to me. I, I uh ... I don't even know why I let you in here. I don't think you realize the trouble you caused me, lady. You know, look, look, I think the best thing for you to do is get outta here. Get outta here. - I'm sorry, Frank. [soft saxophone music] I'm so afraid. [crying] [soft saxophone music] [Sunny crying] [horn honking in distance] [traffic passing] - Morning. - Morning. Where'd you get these Camarillo files? - I borrowed them. - I've been going over them all morning. - Yeah? - The other day, I went to the chancery archives. - The what? - The hall of records for the Catholic Church. - Are you trying to tell me that the killer's a priest? - An ex-priest. - Ex-priest? - Here's a list of all priests who've left the church. Here are the Camarillo patients that fit the psychological profile. Same name's on both lists. - Edward Anthony Heller. - Edward. The old monsignor kept calling him Father Eddie. The dates of his discharge correspond with the dates of the freeway attacks. The evidence is all here. The biblical connection. The calls to the radio station. An ex-priest and ex-mental patient, it's gotta be him. - You got an address? [crickets chirping] [soft suspenseful music] - Frank? - Wait here. [soft suspenseful music] [crickets chirping] [muffled screaming] I thought I told you to wait in the car. [hard breathing] [soft suspenseful music] [suspenseful music and vocalizing] - God, this guy thinks he's surrounded by devils and wants to get rid of them. Look at these notations. They're all based on the medieval religious beliefs reflected in the Bosch paintings. You see the bridged highway in this one? - Yeah. - This is what he's calling the great street, the freeway. Father Eddie is preparing for his final battle with Satan's demons. - A crock of shit. - Where did you say you got the attack dog? What's that thing in your pocket? - This. You wanna hold it? - Not on a first date. - All right, you two. You agreed to work together. - There's a pattern to his killings. Everything's leading to here. Five freeways intersect at this point. It's a big cloverleaf, like a modern Stonehenge. Heller's calling it the great white throne. This is where he thinks God is gonna come down and punish the sins of mankind. - [Frank] So you're saying that this guy's gonna go to this place and wait for the end of the world? - He won't wait. Heller will try to get to this spot before tomorrow. He's got it marked on his calendar. He's not gonna miss it. - [Sunny] What's that? - The Apocalypse. [suspenseful music] [gun clicking] [suspenseful music] - What are you doing? Frank, maybe Lazarus can talk him into giving up. - Yeah, right. - What about the police? - Fuck the police. Come here. Come here. Did you ever fire one of these? - No. - Here, take it. - I don't think so. - Look, this bastard knows where you live. Don't be stupid. Take it in your right hand. Get a good grip on it. Put your finger on the trigger now. Squeeze. [gun firing] [horn honking] [guns firing] [tires squealing] [suspenseful music] [radio chattering] - The last kid was a half-mile before this interchange after these exits were sealed off. He has to still be on the freeway, Lieutenant. - Move the roadblocks back. Cover all routes and exits within a 30-mile perimeter. - Nearly half the entire LA freeway system. How long can we keep it closed? - Until we get the cocksucker. - Okay, you're all set. Sign here. [radio announcer chattering] - Put this away. - Frank. - Take it. Don't worry. [dog barking in distance] [upbeat music] - [David] This is Dr. David Lazarus. Due to the serious nature of tonight's broadcast, we ask the listening public to refrain from making any calls to this station. All regular programming has been preempted. My phone lines are being kept open for the man who has called himself a servant and a traveler, otherwise known as the freeway killer. Edward Anthony Heller, I'm waiting for you to call. [suspenseful music] [tires squealing] [engine racing] [tires squealing] [car crashing sawhorse] [soft suspenseful music] [chimes ringing] [suspenseful music] [gun firing] [glass smashing] [gun firing] [gun firing] [tires squealing] [soft suspenseful music] [traffic passing] [engine starting] [siren blaring] - Father Eddie, the only thing left for you now is to seek redemption at the place you call the great white throne. Go there, and give yourself up for judgment. Heller, if your journey is at hand, you must contact me. [traffic passing] [soft suspenseful music] [engine racing] [soft suspenseful music] - [Edward] We have little time to speak, my prophet. The armies of Babylon are upon me. This is a time of great pain. - [David] Father Eddie, we can make the pain stop. - Just get him here, Doc. - [Edward] Father Eddie is dead. My transformation is almost complete. The others have told me. - Those other voices in your head are lying. If you'll give yourself up, we can make them stop. - [Edward] False prophets will be cast into the lake of fire, Lazarus. [tires squealing] - [David] Heller. [soft suspenseful music] - Jesus Christ. [tires squealing] - Heller, are you still out there? I'm trying to give you a message. If you truly believe that I'm your prophet, you will listen. Heller, I wanna talk to you. Please pick up the phone. I could help you, but you must do what I say. You don't need to hurt anybody anymore. [soft suspenseful music] [horn blowing] [soft suspenseful music] [crickets chirping] [engine racing] [soft suspenseful music] [gun firing] [grenade launching] [flames roaring] [soft suspenseful music] [car exploding] [soft suspenseful music] - [Edward] There are those who try to escape judgment, but the sixth trumpet has sounded. - Now he's hearing trumpets, great. Heller, listen, it is time for your journey to the place you have said will be the great white throne. You most go there now. - [Edward] I'm already there, my prophet. It was necessary to smite down a lone traveler. - You killed a man? - It was necessary. The soldier of Sodom was unprepared to meet the Angel of Death. [soft suspenseful music] I don't believe in the abominable. The whore mongers. And sorcerers. And idolaters! Hold the lions shall find their place and light the fire and brimstone! [shouting in Latin] [engine racing] - The line's open. We got a location. [Edward shouting in Latin] [flames roaring] - I-5 and LA Freeway, old road. [siren blaring] [flames roaring] [sirens blaring] [engine starting] - [David] Father Eddie, they're closing in on you. You will be stopped. It's only a matter of time. I can help you surrender peacefully. In God's name, Heller, please, no more killing. Lay down your gun and give yourself up. Do you hear me? We can work out a way, Heller, a way to end the pain. Pick up your phone and talk to me. [tires squealing] [dramatic music] - Eastern hordes are gathering for the final conflict. The Apocalypse is at hand. - Heller? [line going dead] I lost him. [truck horn blowing] [soft suspenseful music] [engine gunning] [tires squealing] [brakes squealing] - No. [tires squealing] [gun firing] [gun firing] Quinn! [tires squealing] [gun firing] [engine racing] [cars crashing] [flames roaring] Frank. [dramatic music] [gun clicking] [soft suspenseful music] - I am alpha and omega. I am the beginning and the end. [guns firing] And I saw the angel come down. And she had a key in her hand. - [Officer] Freeze, lady. Drop the gun! - The requiem song [speaks Latin]. [soft music] [gun clattering] [soft music] [helicopter flying] [sirens blaring] [siren blaring] [soft music] - Take the cuffs off her. [soft music] [helicopter flying] - [Reporter] According to investigators, Edward Anthony Heller, an ex-communicated Roman Catholic priest and Vietnam veteran-- - Jesus Christ. - [Reporter] Was pronounced dead on arrival. - How about some Chinese? - You buying? - Mandarin? - Szechuan. - [David] David Lazarus, you're the air. - [Greg] Hi, Doc. - [David] Hi. - [Greg] This is Greg. - [David] Hi, Greg, how are you? - [Greg] I'm just fine. - [David] What's on your mind, Greg? - [Greg] I have a relationship with a female that I've been corresponding with for over a year now. - [David] Do you have a question, Greg? - [Greg] Yes, I do. I want to know, is it okay to wait for her? - [David] What do you mean? - [Greg] Well, we've been writing for over a year now. We have this incredible relationship. - [David] Where is she? - [Greg] She lives in Europe. - [David] So is she coming to the United States someday? - [Greg] She says she wants to. - [David] What do you mean wait for her? - [Greg] Well, I'm 31 and she's 14. - [David] What? - [Greg] I know. - [David] She's 14 years old, and she really understands you? - [Greg] She does. She listens to me. And I have problems, I tell her my problems. - [David] Sir, you are what's known as [speaks Latin]. Yeah. You are incapable of dealing with a real relationship with a mature woman. Yeah, yeah, not willing to make a commitment to real life, that's who you are. Yeah, playing long-distance games with this 14-year-old girl, it borders on child abuse. Listen, you're a 31-year-old man. Go look for a grown woman, and let this girl have her childhood, okay? Thank you. Dr. David Lazarus, you're on the air. - [Ethel] Hello, Dr. Lazarus? - [David] Yeah. - [Ethel] How are you, dear, this is Ethel. - [David] Hello, Ethel, how are you? - [Ethel] Fine. I'm doing fine, how are you? - [David] I feel very good. What's on your mind? - [Ethel] I have a neighbor, and whenever he has his girlfriend over, she screams all night long as if she's in unbelievable pain. - [David] Yeah? - [Ethel] And it's a very frightening thing. Screaming and moaning, and it's just unbelievable. It goes on and on and on. - [David] Ethel, what exactly do you hear? - [Ethel] Well, from what I'm able to see through the window, it looks like-- - [David] No, all right, go ahead. I asked you what you heard, but I didn't realize you had visual contact also. - [Ethel] Well, occasionally, you know, I tend to be a little inquisitive, if you know what I mean. - [David] Well what have you found out? - [Ethel] Well, you know, it looks like he's tying her up, and she is like, she is screaming, and she's screaming Slap me and call me Bucky. I think it's very strange. And then the next morning, I see him kissing her goodbye like everything's perfectly fine. - [David] What do you think he's doing to her at night, Ethel? - [Ethel] Well, from the way she's screaming, I'm absolutely sure that he's hurting her. I know it. I'm very psychic about these things. - [David] Uh-huh, I might suggest to you, Ethel, that sometimes the sounds of pleasure and pain can be very similar. If I may, when you have sex, do you ever make noise, Ethel? - [Ethel] I didn't scream like an animal, I mean. I've hung from a few chandeliers in my day too, darling, but I wasn't you know, mashugana. - [David] Did you moan a little maybe or breathe hard or? - [Ethel] I didn't disturb my neighbors. You know, when I listen closely, I can hear them say horrible things to each other. Then she'll start up that screaming like an absolute animal. - [David] Ethel? - [Ethel] Yes. - [David] Don't listen so carefully. Hello, you're on the air. - [Man] Yeah, Doctor? - [David] Hello, you're on the air. Dr. Dave Lazarus. - [Douglas] Hi, this is Douglas. - [David] Hi, Douglas. - [Douglas] Uh, Doctor, I'll get right to the problem. - [David] All right. - [Douglas] I've been wearing women's underwear since high school. I just wanna know your feelings on this. - [David] You want my permission to do this? - [Douglas] I guess that's really what I want. - [David] Have you already tried to go public? - [Douglas] Yes, yes, I have, I have. - [David] And what happened? - [Douglas] Well my wife left me. - [David] She did? - [Douglas] Yes, she did. - [David] And you want my blessing to defy accepted social mores of your particular deviation? I won't do that. Cross-dressing in private is fine, but there are guidelines for living in our culture. You know, this isn't the '60s anymore. - [Douglas] Well could you tell me someone else I could call? - [David] Frederick's of Hollywood [chuckles]. Dr. David Lazarus, you're on the air.
