ULJEZ Here you go. - Thanks a lot. Good evening, big consumers. We close the store in 15 minutes. So, please, make a final decision on the purchase in our store, and come to the cash register, to certify you. Thank you for purchasing on the market "Orahovo Jezero". Jen? - Yes. How much is this? - Oh ... 1.5 bucks. Thank you. - Of course, no problem. Jen? - Yes? Did Steve invite you to leave? No, she's still seen with Carrie. I heard they broke up. - Do I interrupt something? You know ... No no... You have your bag, Mr. Aberneti. Is everything ready? - Oh yes. Yes. We will not forget your plant here. - Oh no, of course. Thank you. Good Lord! Oh, I'm so sorry about that. I'm sorry more. This bag looks ... Nothing, it does not matter. Sorry! Hold your hands, pigeons. Linda, I'm going some tickets. Take care of him. Thank you. Have a nice night. - Thank you. Zdra ... Long time no see. Greg. How come you never gave me a call? I did not check the answering machine for a few days. Oh, I really can believe it. You know, I hold my hand by writing a letter for the letter, hoping you will answer me. Greg, this is not the time ... So, when is the time Jennifer? One year from now, or maybe two? You have no idea what I'm going through, which is even worse, you do not care. - Do you have a problem, Jen? - Get off! - Where are you going? - Let me see what the problem is. I never liked the girls working in this place. Just finish reviewing these contracts, check out the girls, and then close the shop. Well ... At least let me check out the window. Okay. That's $ 1.35 for cigarettes. Jennifer ... Look, I mean you a long time, you know. Greg, I'm sorry what happened, it's really, but it's about us It's almost, and it's almost over a year from now. Ššš! Now listen to me. I've been drinking for a long time. - Well, I did not. And if you do not understand what I'm saying, it will not change anything. - Jennifer! - Please, Greg! Now, I have to get back to work. You owe me $ 1.35 for cigarettes. - You owe me an explanation! - But you do not listen to me! - Was that the right way, Jen !? - You're hurting me! - Leave her alone! - Get lost! You're crazy! You never called me that way again! What the hell's the problem, man ?! Stop this! Stop it! Stop it! Please! - Knock it off! Stop it! Stop fighting! Bile! Just leave him alone! Hey, break it! isuse ... Come on. - What the hell is going on? - Hey! - Shit! - Jennifer, call the police. It's fine. Come on. All right, listen. Listen, everybody. Check the store, but be careful. If you find it, I say it clearly and loudly, stay away from it. Do you understand? All right, let's go. Shit! Police. - Hello! Please, wait. - Do not put me on hold ... isuse! I'm shy of fear for you. What are you doing here tonight? - I'm working. - I thought you were Greg. - Greg? - Greg Piterson. - Greg Piterson !? Hey, I remember him. When she was a bitch, I knocked his ass. Is it? Well, there will be one big bang in the middle of the store. He's out there. Well, if you see him, keep your eyes drenched. Now? Tonight? Tonight. Now. Time, you asshole! You scared me of death! What? I'm sorry. I could not restrain myself. Hey, what happened? Did you see him? No, it's just Tim. Which scared me. You're such a jerk, Time. Really. So typical for you two. Hey, stop kidding, hell, this is a serious thing! You know, I mean, I think I know where Greg might hide. Where? On the attic. "In the attic." - In the attic! - Hey! Shut up. Up there where I got you to smoke that weird tobacco? Oh, come on Bob. Let's check. - Me ?! - Give! Come on, hell. You'll get me in trouble. What? You want to have a beer with me here? - Hey, I heard that! No beer! Come on, go look for him ... - What? What? I do not see anything up here except a lot of darkness. Bob, give me a lamp. Bile! Not! Come on. Oh, my back ... You're standing, Bill. Well, if he's up, there's no way he can come downstairs. Hello? Police, emergency service. Can we help you? Thank God! Here's Officer Adams. How can I help you? Here, Jennifer Ros. Somebody ... Tell me your location? I told you, 21000 ... Are you in danger, ma'am? Now give me my curse. - Are you kidding? - Does it look like I'm joking? Did you call the police? - I ... Call them! - OK! God. You're done. - Now listen, and listen well! If I did not catch you here anymore. You will not deal with the police, but with me. You understand? You better hope that the police get you, before me. It was, unlock the door. Come on, bastard! We're done with you. Get out of here. Open the door, Bill! Come on! Go away! Go away, damn it. Son of a bitch. - Shit. Get out of here! - Well, fuck off! - Clear it. Delete. Go back to work. Come on. The police said they would send their cars as soon as possible. Will you be okay, Jennifer? - I'll be fine. Well, I think we had enough excitement for one night. - Yes. - Yes. Danny and I want to congratulate you all on how you've mastered the situation tonight. You were all good. Does that mean we'll get a raise? Unfortunately no. In fact, I'm thinking that everything in the store is at half price. Why? Bill and I are selling the store. - What?! Now, calm down, everyone. Calm down! Listen to the man. Well, Bill and I ... we agreed to sell the shop, and your jobs will end on the first, next month. Anyway, know that we and Bill are grateful to you in the years that you have been loyal to us, and you'll get a nice bonus on our salary, to show you gratitude. And if any of you guys needs any recommendation, you know, we'll give you the best, the best in the world. I'll be back. And you guys, fix this mess, all right? - OK. I just got a raise. - Yes. isuse. I can not believe. Oh, man, 3 years went down the toilet. What about me, and with my work? I am following two weeks of paid vacation. Not so scary. I can schedule a meeting now. - You did not even work anyway. - You're right there. He would say that. - Would be. We should join the union. - You're right there. You see, I'm not the one who wants to sell the store, believe me. I've been here for more than 10 years. This store is my whole life. Randy, I started working here like a butcher, just like you. In the end, I ended up as co-owner of this site. This is like my other house. If that's true, Bill, why did you leave Deni? I'm not! No, volunteer to know ... Damn, let me tell you this: I own 49% of this place, he owns 51%. It says it all. Yes... You will miss this old place. - Me too. And more than you think. Now, do everyone know what to do tonight? - Yes. Okay. I have to hurry. The real job, Joe! The fact that Danny hires the entire team to work at night by changing all these prices is bullshit. Are you all right, Jen? - I was better. Oh, it's okay. Does anyone need cash here? I will. You see? - The opportunity is calling now. Market "Orahovo Jezero", here Jennifer, halo? Hello? - Hi Jennifer. What do you want? - You. So sensual, so beautiful. I called the police. I guess you're scared, or what? Leave me alone! Do not answer that. That guy is a total jerk! Did you really go out with him? Two months, about a year ago. Then I saw him last time. Where was he? In jail. Are you kidding? - I wish so. Why? What happened? Greg took me to this bar on the beach. And I told him I did not want to see him anymore. And the bouncer came, and told Greg to calm down. Since Greg started battling. - Which is not surprising. And when they separated Greg of that guy, he was dead. He really was somebody? - It was an accident. I suppose. That's so great. And now it's complicated. I had the feeling that someone was watching me. No, again! Just let Greg call it, it will be considered as harassment. Listen, asshole, if you call yet another ... Linda? Oh, Teddy ... What's going on there? Excuse me. No Yes. I'm drinking beer. - What beer? I do not know, let's be a surprise. - All right. You're okay, are not you? No, one jerk is constantly calling, and it drives us. He came and started a fight ... Yes ... Okay. I'll tell you when I get home. We'll talk later. - Bye. - Hi. Jennifer I love you and I'll do anything to get you back. This thing is not easy to open. Ludo. Hey, Jen? - Um? Give me that. Thank you, Dave. Do you need anything else? Yes, a new job. - Ha, tell me about it. Listen, on Saturday night, there are a couple of people coming in if you want to join us. Do you still see Carrie? Oh, well ... no. I'm sorry, I should not have asked you that. No no. It's fine. Listen, I think you would tear everyone up when you got up on Saturday. I would love that. - Really? - Dave, get back to work. - Deni, oh ... Good imitation, you know. Dave, I want you to bring all those crates with bad beans and pineapple. I want to get those things out. Do you want me to bring both the bad beans and the pineapple? Yes. I think I would call it my ... "Super extraordinary special". - OK. How many times have I told you not to ride on that goddamn thing ?! Hey, Jen. I'll pick you up about eight. It's a meeting. Okay. You know, sometimes I wonder, what would happen if people entered the store back ?! Especially you. You know Jen, my old friend Jack Laiza, opens up a new place. I bet you would have some good cash. Can I give you a contact if you want? - It would be great. Do you have an idea of ​​how much my starting salary would be for me? Well, you'll have to see it, but I'm sure it would be about as much as you do now. Thank you. So you and Greg were friends? Yeah, he got me a job. I was his best friend for some time. It's not something you should be bragging about. Greg was pretty good at times, you know? I do not know why he turned it off. I guess because he is old dying. That must have gotten rid of him. After that, he started behaving really weird. - Strange? - Yes. He started stealing money from me. Then he needed more money to buy drugs. I mean, a very serious drug. He was addicted to her, becoming addicted, and behaved towards Jennifer badly. And it came to me one night, and I swear to God, that my brother did not hit him in the head again and again with a mixer, he would kill me. With a mixer? Yes, a mixer from Hamilton Beach. Break ... Lunch break. Sorry about this company. Not. But Chinese food is good for you. - It looks terrible. Terrible. It's a bit greasy, but it can be considered healthy food. Well, it certainly does not look like that. Where is Lorenzo? - She's buying. Yes, that's when it works too soon. Hey, where is Joe? I told him lunch, I do not know where the hell is. The police have not arrived yet. Yes, it only appears when you ride a drive, and you get caught right away. Yes, they almost stopped the firefighters. Hey, watch what you're saying, I was a volunteer firefighter. - Really? - You bet. But I quit. - Why? Because it's dangerous? Not so much because it's dangerous. We did not just fire the fire. We often went to places of traffic accidents, and I can tell you, in the last case where I was, she was enough to force anyone to give up. Why? What happened? Are you not interested in us, but tell us about it. We sat one evening and dinner at the station when we received the call that there was a traffic accident at the end of the city. We flew into the "limousine" and flew out of the station. Well, everyone except the damn Parker. He brought the damn hamburger with him. The first scene we saw when we arrived was a decapitated corpse which lies in the middle of the road. And they could not find his head. Oh, that's sick. The guy lost his head. So, Parker is walking down the road, looking for a head, and still eat his goddamn hamburger. Watch everyone now, this is true. He assumed he could do something useful. He walked a few inches from the place where the ax was, and that disgusting presence that lay there. And here comes the fucking Parker, walking down the road, waving his hand in one hand, and a hamburger in the other, and still eats it! And, of course, there was no need to say anything more, everyone was simply stripped off. Shit. What the hell was that? Police! Police! Yes, here I come! I am coming! Hello. - How are you? - Okay. I'm Officer Dalton. This is Officer Matthews. Good evening. - How are you sir? I'm Bill Robinson. Jennifer is the one who called you. Bye. - How are you, ma'am? Have you had any more problems with that guy since we talked? Are we? Well, he called it recently. Well, was there a threat or something? Not. We'll check that guy ... - Greg Piterson. ... Greg Pitererson. Yes. Well, all we know is that he went to the conditional. Well, if you see him here again, do not hesitate to call us. And here's my card. No, this is not my card. This is my card. Yes. So, as I said, do not hesitate to call. Mathew. We wish you a pleasant evening. You can not even go in or out. I'm already feeling much safer. - Much better, anyway. Boys in blue. - Here we go. Come on. These guys can not catch a cold. Hey, were they cops? - Yes. - To pick up Greg? - Not. Not yet. Nedi is waiting for me at home and hates me when I'm late. Jen, your nose ... I think I have a handkerchief. Are you OK? Go. Who is there? OK! I'll cut you from there. I'll do that. I still can not believe that we are constantly losing money, in the previous two years. Sad but true. So Danny, what the hell do you expect me to do? I sit here and watch "Bulldogs," and I'm waiting for the First in the month to come? When this is cleared up, they can turn this place into "Porno Shop", I do not care. Now, you get cash from the sale, we have signed a contract, now sign. But Danny, I can not ... - Sign. All right, I have a job over my head, why do not you go downstairs too He made sure that those jokers did not get us, huh? Close the door when you're out. Get the hell out of here, you little one. Get lost. Come on, get lost. Son of a bitch. I will teach you ... Help me! Oh, man. Help! Market "Orahovo Jezero"? - Hi Jen. - Bye, Teddy. - Is Linda still there? No, she's gone a long time ago. Hey, Jen. I'm sorry. - Evil? The nose does not stop bleeding. Greg stared at me through the window. And Ted called for Linda, she has not arrived yet ... - Hey! Hey! Hey! Relax. Look at you. You're all shaking. The police will catch Greg, and we'll all be safe. Do not worry. Wait, wait! Oh my God! You will bring us into such trouble! FIRST SAFETY The knives are sharp Please be careful Shit! I hate when that happens. Typically. What the hell...? Hey, asshole, stop it! Oh, that hurts. Hey, Dave, drop your knife. - Where's your knife? - Just give it to me. My broken one. Okay. Here he comes. I have it. Thank you, Dave. Hey, Danny? Was it? Where the hell did they go? Which stupid idiot put this ... Oh ... I put it. Oh, you got it. Shit. Hey, shut the fucking door! Bob? Man, what are you doing? Close the door, man! Bob? Stop kidding, guys. I'm trying to work. And do not leave the open door, please. Shit... Hey. Who is this? Time? So, I know you're. Very funny, Time. Time? This is not interesting, Time. Will you give a good old Bob another joint? Well, you know, I do not really think so. Because I'd have to shake it with your pants, Time! Very funny, jerk. What the fuck? Time? Fuck you, Time. Oh, wow, that's Tim. What a surprise. Time, you look terrible. Have you made a move? Do you even talk, Time? What is it, did your pussy eat your tongue? Not! Not! Not! Not... Not! Not! Not! Not! Not! Not! Not! Not! Not! Not! Not! Not! Not! I'd swallow these ribs. Cheer up. OK. These are waste. These are the ends. What the hell is this? You go to a special expense request. What the hell is this? They put this shit up here. Hey, Bob, throw me a knife, will you? I'm in Division 7 myself. Hey, asshole! Close it before throwing it. Randy? The cutter is on. Come on, open up. That's right. Randy? Bob? Who's here? Very funny, guys. Pig's legs. Randy? Oh, shit. Randy, you got blood here. Bob? Hey, Bob, I know you're up there fucking up. Very funny. Bob? I know you're worse, stop dumbing, man. Bob? I know you're ... Jenny! Jenny, behind you! Jenny! - Help me ... Help ... - What ?! Help me please! Help me ... Hey! Not! Not! Not! Oh no! Not! Dave? Time? Bob? Randy? Dave? Where is everyone? Dave? Dave? Hello! Randy? You could clean up here. It's not funny, Randy! Oh my God! God! Oh my God! Danny! Bile! Danny! Open up! Oh my God. Shit! It's closed. Wait! Let me! Greg ... Oh God... Greg ... Greg ... Oh God... Deni ... Oh ... Dave ... "I'll pick you up ..." "... eight." "It's a meeting." Who is there? Oh, calm down, honey. Everything will be fine. Everything will be fine. Everything will be fine. I tried to stop Greg in the back of the store, but my son's son blew my hammer off. He killed everything ... Ššš. Just calm down. Calm down, you'll be fine. You'll be safe. Wait here, I'm going to call the police. Not! Not! Not! You killed them. You killed all of them. But why? Because of the store. Danny has always been a great boss. He always called the bosses for every job. So far. I could not let this son of a bitch take my store away. The store is my whole life. I had to kill him. Then I and Greg have nothing to do with it! I could not let anyone stop me. Looks like I was a little interested. You're sick! Can not you see, I'm just crazy about this shop! I'm sorry, dear. I'm really sorry. But there will be another murder here tonight, and Greg will take all the guilt. Help me! Somebody ...! Not! Who is there? Who is there? Answer me! Help me ... Somebody help me ... Denny? Help me ... - Danny? Help me ... Somebody help me ... You're next. Here comes the fucking Parker, walking down the road, waving his hand with a head in one hand, and a sandwich in the other. You're playing a hard nut. Delete! Jenny! Ššš! Ššš! Now listen to me! That son of a bitch, Bill, tried to put me in! That's why he did not kill me. We muttered, and he fainted me. When I came to consciousness, I saw him killing Linda! I tried to go after him, but ran into the store and locked the door before he could reach it ... I even tried to call the cops! Now listen! We have to get to the bathroom window, so we'll get out of here ... Squeeze this out! Where did you get that? Hello? Police, emergency service. How can we help? This is Jennifer Ros. I'm in Night Street 21000. This is an emergency. I need help. Are you in danger, ma'am? Will you send patrol cars? Yes... Where are you going? All right, do not move! We did not do anything ... - Look ... Come on! Come here! On the hood, buddy! Officer! What is this? What is this? - It's my penis! What are you doing ?! Give me that hand ... I'm the one who called you! - Shut up! They did it. They plucked it all ... ...in the store... - It's lying! - We are not! He's a killer. Damn! - Look ... - Get back to the car! Come back! Tell the officer ... ... Yes. - What's your position? - We did not do it! - Shut up! Send another vehicle. Leave her alone! Oh, Jesus Christ, There's slaughter in there. The bodies are everywhere. They are all disfigured. He did it! You're under arrest. Here we go. Listen carefully: you have the right to remain silent, everything you say will be used in court against you ... Not!
