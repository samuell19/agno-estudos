VIENNA 1906 - You're late. - I took two cabs to be safe. No. First make sure I wasn't followed. No one. The street's empty. Anyone can hide in a carriage entrance. I'm sure he suspects. You're only happy in love first it's coupled with fear. Anyway, he can't be jealous of me. not special at me. He said to take a married woman as a mistress. - He did? - Yes. - It's better since it doesn't last. - He gives dreadful advice. We've been seeing each other for a year. That's right. A year exactly. The masked ball at the Opera. The two masks which met that night... - You! - Sorry. Only me. Husbands ring bells more imperiously. As you'll soon find out. - Any more tomfoolery? - No. I came for you. - She's still here? - Yes. And late. Out you go. Don't forget the lads' night out! - It was... - Your pal, Theo. I know. Every time you find him, stay in bad mood with me. I'm not sulking. Of course not. But when you look out the window, I know what you're thinking. You hate waiting here for me instead of drinking with your pals. I'm a married woman. Single women are more fun. - You hate me for your unhappiness. - Untrue. Maybe these two masks should never have been found. But what's done is done. Too bad for you. You're mine. Here's Theo! Where's Franz? He'll join us later. He's busy. He's studying the Battle of Austerlitz. A battle that always puts him in a foul mood. He needs a new battle. Gentlemen, the usual conditions. Anyone who doesn't bed a woman pays for the champagne in the mess. - Agreed? - Closed! Big deal! Three lemonades, right? Alcohol gives me heartburn. Three lemonades. - Did you write this waltz? - Yes. Well, almost. I found the motif. But another man used it. As always. It's the last time. No one treads on my toes! - Christine, waltz with me. - No treading on toes now! Mizzie! She's right. I compose waltzes but dance them badly. I'll lead. Excuse us, won't you? - Found mine! - I saw her first. No fighting over girls, only betting. That's the rule. Six. Evens. Nine. Evens. Mademoiselle, please... would give me the honor of this waltz? It's impossible. I was invited. - By whom? - This gentleman asked first. I send optic telegrams. They're faster. May I? It's not me. The orchestra is too fast. It should go... Women! Betray me until in music. Henceforth I'll be fierce: Eye for eye, tooth for tooth. - Watch it, will you? - Excuse me. - Bravo! - Outstanding! Let's close our eyes and go. Why? Mizzie isn't worthy of being your relation. - She's outrageous. Come. - Is that an order? A prayer. Christine, we're almost engaged. "Almost, almost." With you, it's always almost. Well, I'm almost sure I don't want to marry you. Christine! You're sad from tip to toe. On Sundays with you, my parasol becomes an umbrella. I'm 20. I want to have fun, like Mizzie. Go on then. Lift your skirts and dance with the dragoons. But I will not sit at the same table. Are you coming? One, two... So be it. Adieu, Christine. Another argument? A lover's tiff. He'll be back. You don't know civilians. They can't argue for fun. They always take it seriously. If you'll excuse me. Hello and goodbye. I promised I'd come, but now I'm leaving. I've just found two girls. What about the other one? Whatever. I want to be alone. Amazing! Always he is with that woman, stay in bad mood. I can't break up with her. We should be banned from married women. Forget her. Look. Pretty girls, eh? It's easy. Listen again. One star, 2nd lieutenant. Two stars, lieutenant. Three stars, Captain. And what's four stars? General? No idea. I've never met a superior officer. This is Lieutenant Franz Lobeimer. Miss... Mizzie Schlager. Mizzie Schlager and Miss... Christine Weiring. Christine has love problems. Waiter, a bottle of Tokay! Ask her to dance. - Maybe latter. - Silly! The best way to forget a man is to dance with another. - Dance with me now then. - Why? So you don't forget me too quickly. Serious love problems? I don't have love or problems. Then you need seeing to. You don't have to try to cheer me up. You want to be alone? Well, so do I. So let's just pretend to be together. Then we'll both close our doors. - Goodnight, Miss. - Goodnight. Is she blonde or brunette? No peeking through the keyhole. May I come in? For a second. No more. Just to ask the time. Five to eleven. Why? I have a rendezvous at the Opera at eleven-thirty. Young or old? Neither. With my father. - I shall escort you. - No. I can go alone. - Please don't bother. - Yes, but I insist. - I must go. - I'll come too. No bother. It's on my way. Must I stay here all alone? Not at all. You're on my way too! - You don't know where I live. - No matter. All paths lead to mine tonight. To yours? Out of the question. Just see me at home. Your silence is due to one of two things. Either I bore you or you have a headache. Let's say it's a headache. Really? I have just you need. - A pill? - No. No. Eau de Cologne. You'll see. I'm sure it will go soon. - Is it a headache or not? - Yes Then let me. First take your hat off. I'm too kind, caring for a man who wakes me every morning. - I wake you every morning? - Yes, with your horses and bagres. As you leave the barracks with your horses and bugles. Really, make quite a noise. - The window that slams with anger is you? - It's me! Delighted to meet you. - What if I promise to behave? - I can't. Not even for champagne? The one you'd win? How do you know that? I wasn't born yesterday. The bet has never changed. Never mind. Then I'll walk you home. - You promise to behave? - I swear. Then I accept. But no more than five minutes. Wait me here for a second. Good evening, lieutenant. Forgotten your key again? Yes. I was late. - I was with the Minister. - A serious situation? - Very. - Jesus, Mary and Joseph! Their policcies! Their policcies keep me awakeeat night Tell me everything, lieutenant. I won't repeat a word. The balance of Europe is threatened. - Like the other night? - Exactly. Turkey's fault again! The Sublime Gate is all trouble. That Sublime Gate! Open, closed, open, closed... Good job, we keep watch. Good. I hope there'll be no complications. - None. The Diplomacy fix all. - Great Diplomacy! You don't imagine what the Diplomacy can make. It gives me creeps! To think the people haven't a clue! It's the first time I've been alone with a captain. At night too! It seems funny. Not captain. 2nd lieutenant. Is that higher or lower? At night, it's sometimes higher. Here. I feel better. Keep it. It'll be a souvenir for me. For you? How's that? Every time I count my handkerchiefs, I'll think of you, of course. We're here. Is your father often at the Opera? Yes, every night and on Sunday afternoons. - He's a music lover? - No. A cellist. Opera is silly because things never happen like that in real life. Tonight is Romeo and Juliet. I could have gone. But they die in the end. I hate sad endings. - Good night. - Don't curse me tomorrow morning. It's Papa who curses. He hates brass instruments! - And you? - Me? I try to accustom. - See you in the morning. - See you. - Joseph didn't escort you? - No. - Where was this night? - The trumpets are very high. A 2nd lieutenant saw me here. Is that bad? Only if you hid something from me. I'm all you have left. What did this 2nd lieutenant say? He said very little. But he's very handsome and he dances so well. Did you dance a lot? Not once all evening. But I'm sure he dances well. Then draw. - What? - Mizzie and I, Christine and you. Not exactly. I'll tell you later. Christine. I came to apologise for last night. - I was stupid. - You weren't. Yes, I was. Stupid, ludicrous and boring. I realised later. But it's all over now. Today, your sweetheart is ready to laugh, dance, stop getting angry and never speak ill of Mizzie. So, you don't hate me? Not any more. You love me? I adore you! - Truly? - Yes. Truly, truly! If you knew how happy I am this morning. Bugler, signal 1 st Platoon! - Did you kiss her? - No. But the moon was magnificent. Did she put on airs? No. I didn't try. He is the shame of this regiment! A nice girl, no strings attached... You know her? No, but I asked Mizzie. They're made for us and we for them. As long as it doesn't last. - How is with the baroness? - I don't know more. The first 6 months were like a week. Now a week is like 6 months. You must break it off. An affair with no more love is worse than when love and ends. 2nd Platoon, ready to charge! Forward! We don't have ribbon to match your hat. So, keep looking, miss. Well? We didn't talk much. He had a headache. The best cure is a kiss. No. Not with him. He's a bit arrogant at first, but is only charm. Who told you? Theo. Last night. See, I thought of you. - And the ribbon, Miss? - I'm looking, Madam. Let's go out all together. And Joseph? He swore on his own head I'd love him one day. He can wait. We all end up marrying Josephs. I'm not silly. Come here to talk of Franz. He didn't even ask for a date. I bet you're already a tad in love with him. Mizzie, love doesn't come so fast. It depends. Mine comes on a gust of wind. And usually disappears the same way. Miss! I'm sorry, we have no matching ribbon. But you have it in your hand! So I do! - Are you seeing Theo tonight? - Tomorrow. He's on duty tonight. - Could you take me the ribbon? - Coming. Goodbye. Is it your first serious break-up? Yes. It's as easy as saying hello. Start by telling her she was the love of your life. That works like chloroform. The rest is painless. Lansky'll make us late. They wait for us at 10 am. He must be admiring his new star. Here he is. Attention! Enough! The first to call me captain gets two days in the brig. The big advantage of being captain: No more dancing with the colonel's daughters! It's a sweet pleasure for the satisfaction of you, lieutenants! Helena, I need to talk to you. Hush. Later. He's watching. I'd like to ask your wife to dance, but she doesn't have eyes for me. Your young prot?g? is a fine dancer. Startling! That lieutenant has danced twice in a row with the baroness while your daughters are wallflowers! - The colonel's daughters, dear! - Mama! Silence! I've something to say. - I know. You're going to tell me how unhappy you are. - Yes. You're sick of waiting hours for me and things must change. wonderful! Brilliant! Things will change. Tomorrow a new life begins. - A new life? - Yes. My husband is going to Salzburg for 2 weeks. During 15 days I will at your home every night. I can't believe our good fortune. Excuse me. Every night I'll be waiting for you. Is only close the curtains and make account we are in Venice or Florence. Two weeks, Franz, is an eternity. The first few days at least. Helena, you are the love of my life. I hope so. You are too. Tomorrow. Yours. 7 pm. This season at the Opera we have Caruso... My dear, accord me this waltz. And dance it with our good friend Wiemel. You can no longer accuse me of being jealous. Franz, I'm a friend of the family and yet you tell me nothing. What is it? Heartbreak? Certainly not... - Hidden Love? - No. Of course it is. The colonel isn't dissatisfied with you, but he think you very close, very secret. Even leaving enough with your friends. Perhaps. But I'm planning on changing things. Soon, you won't recognise me. Naturally, you'll declare your love. Not tonight. I'll bide my time. It will never come. It will happen very soon than you imagine. And if I told my husband? He wouldn't believe you. His distrust won't let him believe a thing. How was it, painless? - I split the manoeuvre in two. - Bad strategy! Tomorrow at 7 am she goes to my home. Everything will be finished at 7:30. Come. Nothing like a waltz to clear the mind. You haven't danced with me once. And you leave tomorrow for 2 weeks. I wouldn't leave you. I'd like you to accompany me. Out of the question. I don't like of improvised travels. - You always said the opposite. - I've changed my mind. - What could keep you in Vienna? - Nothing. - Then this is a caprice. - Perhaps. The change is your caprice in the morning. Don't count on it, dear. Mr Franz, madam left with sir for Salzburg. A last-minute decision. Mr Franz will understand, I hope? Thanks, Emille. Thirteen. Good evening. Fourteen. Her leaving surprises me. She said she'd stay in Vienna. What could have happened? Don't ask. As Napoleon said: "In love, the only victory is flight". Your victory is double, you flee and she takes the train. - I just pocketed all. - Ok. - You win. - And pay, as usual. Coming, free man? I've an idea for tomorrow. Leave it to me. A threepenny lovers' waltz It's only sung in spring And often though to the end I vow to you, my love To love you for evermore Wherever the wind comes from So this is a fine song Every ball has its lovers Its threepenny lovers That it watches as they dream while dancing cheek to cheek But all that's left in winter Just an air weeping on the wind The love of the threepenny lovers. Sorry, the door was open. Come in. The lesson's over. When's your audition? Never, probably. Papa can't decide to ask. But you're not ready yet! Why don't you addmit, daddy? You are an opera musician... but have preconceptions with theater. Preconceptions, I? And conservative too? I'll ask for your audition tomorrow. So no more of it. Going for a pic-nic? Yes. And I'd like to invite Christine. Just the two of you? I won't lie. There'll be four of us. But they're serious boys. Christine, do you want to go? I ought to say no. Really want to go? - My darling Papa! - Quickly. Go and get dressed. There. Walk so I can see. More relaxed. Swing your hips. Not too much. Oh no, Mizzie! What? What's got into you? Next to you, I'll look a lump. If you leave me alone with him, it will be worse. The other day, he barely spoke. You are silly! I show you what to do when you're alone. Firstly, know what type he likes. Between us, men are totally stupid. You sit next to me, on the grass. You raise your hem. Not too much. We hide our legs to make him want to see them. First try the shy type. Good. Now turn them towards me. In admiration. Admiration, I said. Ecstasy, even. Men always believe it's true. And if he still says nothing? Then change the type. A vague look. Sigh a little. Naturally, if he asks, you say your life is very complicated. Try another one again. A wasp comes. You gasp... I said gasp, not shriek. Look at him. With your eyes closed, of course. And? If he doesn't kiss you, the Austrian army is finished! Now let's hurry. What's your promise? To be home before dark. - Goodbye, Mizzie. - Goodbye, Mr Weiring. Joys of nature, my foot! Brambles, thistles, creepy-crawlies... And yet, I'd still come again next Sunday. How silly women are! Your friend is nice, but she puts on airs. And I did explain it all. Christine, what's on your mind? Many things. Under this simple exterior, my life is so complicated. Why don't you talk everything to me? There's no point... You would not understand. Oh, a wasp! A wasp! They don't need us any more. No. Leave me alone. Behind your ear. Where have they gone? What do you expect? Summer, the day, sweet grass... Why do you lie to me? Me? Passing yourself off for something you're not. So you'll be interested in me. And because Mizzie was here. It was a joke. But now we're alone, it's different. I should go home. There's an idea! Why? I was stupid. Now you'll always see me as stupid. I know. Mizzie! I ought to say goodbye to her. Theo! I'll look that way. Theo! Don't answer. - What? - Christine's going. We argued. Idiot, I said to use feeling. Much feeling. As the rulebook says: The rest will follow. Have you two finished conspiring? Try a boat for some Sunday romance. They believe all you say on water. Roll up for boat hire! It's a lovely day for a boat trip. This way, lovers, for your photo. A souvenir photo, Christine? Souvenir of what? A day lost? Come on, ladyes and gentlemen, take a boat trip. - A perfect pose! - Rowers, this way, please! Ladies, my rowboats await. Absolutely charming. Good. Stay still. A nice smile... - Smile, Christine. - It's not that easy! No arguing. Wasted days often leave us the best memories. How can I take a photo if you don't smile? Christine, don't poke fun at me, but I'm falling in love with you. Wonderful! That's not true. Will be a beautiful photo. Collect it in an hour, after a little boat trip. A rowboat? This way, please. Souvenir photos! Have your photo taken! Wait. I'll find you my nicest rowboat! Love comes on slowly. You think you're acting but it becomes real. It has happened with you, Christine. It's bad, what you're doing, Franz. What's bad? Say these things for the girls, so they'll lose their heads. For you officers, it's just a passing game. But beware, Franz. For... although I know you're lying... I'm just as silly as the others. Christine. I'd hate you afterwards. Please don't cry. It's nothing. It's true I told you sweet nothings. But you were false, too, earlier. So we're quits. I suggest we both be honest. Only the truth. Promise? - I promise. - Cross your heart? And hope to die. You start. Tell me the truth about your headache the other day. I bet it was a woman running round inside. Was it? A storm's brewing. It's so muggy. Let's sit awhile. Your turn to tell me the truth. Tell me about your love life. No. - It's a pity. - What is? That we started off by being fake. Now, if we really liked each other... we wouldn't dare admit it. Papa will be worried. I've never come home so late. Keep the cab. I'll walk back. - Goodnight. - See you tomorrow. A drop of rain. They say that lovers who are rained on during their first walk will love each other for ever. Christine, I want to promise something. Promise nothing. Between us, what will be will be. I swear I'll ask nothing of you. There. It's raining. Now we'll love each other for ever. See you tomorrow. Don't forget me by then, lieutenant. There you are! Come over here. I wont let my qdagter ot so late ith an oold persono Explain yourself. I've nothing to explain, Papa. I'm happy. So happy. If only you knew. Tell me about it. Tell me about it. 2nd-lieutenant, you are late! Sorry, captain. Idiot! Have a box for you. Was brought... by two girls who find us charming. We reciprocate, since it's the day after the first Sunday. The second Sunday will be good too. The third will seem long. And the fourth may be the last. We're not there yet. Look, a message. Signed Christine. It's not a hat but a messenger pigeon! "I sewed up the lining, "as it looked a little worn." The needle and thread are the first tools of marriage. So beware. Sentiment, sure. Enough to forget the Baroness. But nothing more. Understood? Yes, lieutenant. Run to the florist and have 12 roses sent to 34 Schubertgasse. Red roses, naturally, because she believe yet in the language of flowers. I'm a fool. I can't dance, can't send flowers and can't talk to women. He didn't speak much either. And we haven't danced together once. I finally understand crimes of passion. I'll be on page 3 of the newspaper. Christine, I love you. Love fades and we feel better. - Will your love fade? - I meant you. For me... At least I have music. Exactly! Work on your opera again. You're very talented, Joseph. If I were, it would be known. No. I'll write my waltzes that others steal. It's my destiny! My own destiny! Poor Joseph, I hate seeing you sad. Come on, give a little kiss on my face, let's go? I don't want charity. Be brave. Don't hurt my feelings. Let's go, give me a kiss. - It's our 3rd anniversary. - How's that? Our third Sunday. Mizzie told me yesterday. But since I met you, every day is Sunday. Franz! Franz, quick. There's an echo. - Franz! - Christine! - I swear... - I'll love you... For ever! Don't laugh, Franz. Hear that murmur? That's all the oaths of love shouted before ours. The echo never forgets. Only true lovers can hear them. I'm exausted. I'm so happy. And hungry. I could eat a mountain of cakes! You choose. I'll order the coffees. Wait in the carriage. - Already back? - This morning. I sent Emily to your place earlier. But two weeks ago I... A long time, isn't it? Helena, I've something to say. Go ahead. Not here. I'm with friends. Thank you. - Franz, could you speak about this? - What? Who was the lady in black? I don't remember of dresses. The woman with whom was talking. In Vienna, officers know all ladies. This year, they're wearing black. In the street, we confuse them all. It seems that recognize this. Christine, I thank that no do any questions. - Do I ask you questions? - You could. But I don't. Here. Drink your coffee. - What did you do this morning? - Same as yesterday. I have no secrets. Neither do I. Actually, I do. A very big secret. Just one. You, Christine. I've forgotten everything from before. The lady in black is nobody. Do you believe me, Christine? The day I stop believing you will be the end of the world. Franz? Hello? Is that you? Don't you recognise my voice? I'm calling from the barracks. I am replacing an official until tomorrow. Of course it's true. Gotta be quick, understand. Give me another date. Tomorrow night, my place. I'll be on duty at the Opera. Arrange something. I demand an explanation. Listen... No. I won't wait another day. I said, tomorrow night, in my place. Hello, Wiemel. You wanted to talk? Yes and no. It depends. - On whom? - On you. When one hears something regarding a married friend, there are two ways to be ignoble. Tell him everything, or tell him nothing. What you recommend me? Speak. 2nd Lieutenant Lobeimer lives behind St Michael's Chapel. Number 17. Continue. As fate would have it, I was just passing by... No. It is too shameful. Continue. - You won't believe me. - I said continue! What is it, dear? Feeling unwell? I have a headache. You'll have to go to the Opera without me. That would be regrettable. The Emperor will come and our friends will be there tonight. Anyone can get a headache. Perhaps. But on some nights it's most regrettable. Don't insist, please. And do not be late because of me, it would never forgive me. Then rest well, dear. I'll look in on you after the performance. Did you have a good trip? Excellent. But I'm happy to be back among friends. I trust we'll still see you often at the house. Certainly. How about dinner tomorrow? I'm already booked. The day after tomorrow? I'll be on duty then. I refuse to be beaten. We'll talk again. These are the best seats. We can see the actors in the wings. We can see Papa, too. He looks so excited. He was so nervous before leaving, I had to tie his bowtie. Look. Silly things. They're looking for us on the wrong side. The ladies below have such funny hairdos. But after the show, the boys will meet the ladies above. - Looking for someone? - The lady in black I told you about. Don't. Thinking about people makes them come back. Anyway, all men have a lady in black in their memory. Don't let people see us. We have free tickets. They're so silly! Wait! Aim well. If I'm not back before the end, make something up. I'll see you later. Great. Go, Don Juan. But no noise. The Commander is in the house. Let me look at you first. After an absence, one can feel disoriented. One always hurts the other. But no matter. First, we tell each other everything. In a while, it will be over and tomorrow, forgotten. I'm glad you take it so lightly. I do have a lot to tell you. Impossible. - You too, perhaps. - No. You first. Go on, I'm listening. Was it one or several? One. One is a lot. I prefer many. Several are easier to forget. Hold on, I can see her now. Blonde, petite, blue eyes... - How do you know? I told you I have some witch in me. What is she, a maid, a seamstress, a dancer in the corps de ballet? No, I print she is the most innocent of creatures. Pure as the white of the snow. I beg that talk about her with more respect. Don't tell me you've fallen in love! Fair enough. But no more games. It isn't a game for me. It's over between us, Helena. It was, even before I met her. Before you left Vienna. Then only I didn't know. I still hear you on that last day, whispering, "I love you," in the dark. One says "I love you" while thinking "I loved you". The tenses of "love" are easily confused. Franz... Listen. I offer you something. Let's take a one-month break. Until the Emperor's Ball. Then we'll see who misses whom most. In the meantime, good luck. Good luck to you. But I warn you, until there, already be married. You're mad. Maybe. But it's delightful being mad. To dream and not know what day of the week it is. I've never experienced that. I'm sorry, Helena, but I'm happy. She doesn't know yet. I had to say goodbye to you first. Goodbye and hello. For you'll be my best friend, won't you? - If you agree? - You're uncouth and self-centred. You're just like the rest. Only you're stupid with it. But who is she? Tell me your name, at least. She has no name, no money. All she has is me. So just have fun with her. Helena! Today he's hurting me, but my console is that you will be unhappy. That was cruel, Franz. Please forgive me. Here... Your letters. I'll return yours too. Helena, don't read them. You must burn them. You're right. You'll see later... that the hardest thing is not burn the letters. It's forgetting them. This Don Juan... thousand women! A lot for one man. Men in his day were different to today's. Baron Egersdorf'ss carriage! Hello, is that the Opera? Can you tell me which act is on? The last act has just begun. Thank you. I must go. One more minute. Look at the couple in the mirror. It saws we so happy together and thought this would be forever. Now they'll each go their separate ways. Let's bid them "adieu". "Adieu", Franz. "Adieu", Helena. There. No. That way. Will meet you with her now? I don't want to lie to you. Yes. She's lucky. You like danger, madam. But you are prudent. You get your lovers out just in time. No! No lies. He was here. And I know who he is. He was seen leaving the house. - I won't discuss this with you. - You will. Prove my blindness to me. Or beg for my forgiveness. But talk, will you! With a wife like you, I can behave like a boor and search everywhere. You must have letters hidden somewhere. What's so funny? There. Not smiling anymore. Where could he be? I told you. At the barracks, calling the roll. Very well. Let's say he is. Forever suspicious. - I know men. - Here he is! - How was the roll call? - Admirable. Hear how they back each other up! Christine, when the man who loves to follow behind, check if he has another woman's hair on him or a suspicious scent. Franz, no listen to her. I will never ask for nothing. Not me, Christine. We love blindly. That's how accidents happen. I want a word with Franz. You two, run along. - What a daring! - Come on. It wasn't painful, was? Yes, but I've forgotten it now. It's like I've cleared an obstacle. And your first act as a free man is to propose Christine in marriage? Yes, tonight. It's a weird way to celebrate the freedom. She's very dear to me, Theo. I want Christine. I want more than a weekend romance. Don't try to convince me. I know what you're going to say. With the wedding I will win the family's fury and the mockery of friends. But all I care about is Christine. I am still some years older than you, and if you won't be my Best Man, I'll beat you. Respect my grey hair! - Will you? - No. You're stupid! - Repeat that! - Stupid! - Will you? - No. It's stupid. - Answer me. - I give up. I accept. Attention! Lieutenants, your colonel is not happy. Aren't you ashamed, playing games while two gentle young women await you? - You'll have a month in the brig! - Who said you could wear that? Quiet! I've something to ask Christine. I've an announcement too. - Me first, it's very important! - No, the mine is more important. In 2 days, I'm auditioning at the Opera! But I'm so nervous. Best cure for nerves is champagne! Stage fright, like battle fright, is necessary for victory. If you have it, you'll ve fine. - Let's drink to success! - To love! - Expecting someone? - No. Don't open it, then. Cheers! What, Franz? - What is it? - Nothing. Forget it, you're not in! You can see the light from the street. Better go answer. - Cheers! - Cheers! Sorry, I don't want bother you. No. Be my guest. - Having a party? - Just a few friends. Don't introduce me. I'll stay only for one question and one reply. About you and my wife. Someone saw her coming out of your home. I thought of asking for your word as an officer, if was guilty. But you might give it and I'd despise you for it. I preferred wait and confirm the story of another way. I am under his orders, sir. - Who was it? - Him. - Egersdorf? - He knows. He knows nothing. You didn't confess, did you? He had proof. My key. So? I will have to crossing blades with him. In two days, no doubt. Would you and Lansky be my seconds? Count on us. - Do we tell the girls? - No. I don't want Christine to know. Let's go in. What is this? - Christine, take off this mask. - No. If you can be mysterious, so can we, in our own way. Music! - Who was that? - Nothing, just a business to resolve. Christine, take off this mask. Is it bringing back memories? Then I will. From tonight, no more memories. Only our plans. What was it you wanted to say earlier? - Me? - Yes. That I love you, Christine. And will love you all my life. I can swear to you it now. Here are the conditions you will demand. Distance, 20 paces. Change of bullets, 3 times. Of course, as the offended party, I shoot first. - It's a real duel? - Yes. A real one. Your conditions are unacceptable. 20 paces is a sure hit. We'll give the opponent the first shot, but at 30 paces. We've been told that these conditions are final. Then all we can do is record them. - Gentlemen, I won't sign. - We have no choice. More can you've done. I shall return in one hour. Gentlemen. - Colonel... - One second. I'll see you, but I don't like my hand being forced. So be brief. - It's about the duel of Lobeimer. - I know you are his second, and? The Baron has first shot and demands 20 paces only. It's his right. I can't admit that one of my officers be afraid to go to fight. - Lobeimer doesn't know I'm here. - Then why are you? - This duel is absurd, sir. - A duel is never absurd. This duel haven't sense. Lobeimer want to get married. I know. He asked for my permission. I couldn't refuse this to him. But it pains me. A dragoon officer with no fortune can't marry without a dowry. This puts at risk all my rules. Well sir, if the duel goes ahead, the wedding won't. I know that. The Baron is a good shot and keeps a calm head. I suggest you do the same. I refuse to second at a murder. It's a matter of honor. They say that only blood justify the honor. I answer this is an idiot point of view when is an ordinary massacre. Lieutenant Kaiser, your promotion is compromised. Expect my resignation tomorrow. Perfect. Then you're dismissed. Hello, sir. I'm Franz Lobeimer. I've heard all about you. My daughter talks of you every day. Come in. And make yourself comfortable. - I wanted to talk to her. - She's not here. I should be in opera too, where she makes your hearing test, but she was afraid and I was too. I had not courage to go there. The way was stay calm here alone, on my way. Let's wait for her together. Ave Maria Maiden mild Oh, listen to a maiden's prayer For though canst hear tho' from the wild And thou canst save Safe may we sleep beneath thy care Tho' banished, outcast and reviled O, Maiden hear a maiden's prayer O, Mother, hear a suppliant child Do you like music, Franz? Especially today. It makes you think of all you could have but never will. At your age, you can have all you want. I wish Christine would come back. I don't know what's got into me. Never have children. But if you do, don't teach them music. There she is! - Well? - Daddy! Tell us about it. Franz, you're here? - So much happiness in one day! - Well, tell us everything. He said, "You can have a big part. "But I think we'll have good news for you, my child." - Before to speak he cough? - Yes. - Like this? - No, like this. Then you did it! If he coughed like that, he was holding back to listen. I must go. I have a lesson to give. I should be jealousy, because she only worked hard for you, not for me. Yes, I should be jealousy, but I don't have time. I start in 3 weeks. Jot it down so you don't forget. - In three weeks? - In this same day. At 8:30, and that night I will revenge of the beautiful ladies. I will be on stage and is for me they will look. Why aren't you writing? I don't make rendezvous too far ahead. You're becoming as superstitious as I was. Since my audition, I no longer more fear of anything. I trust life. Franz, I can be famous one day. Let me say all the silly things I like. It will be wonderful! Because everyone will talk of me and you will be proud. Tell me you're happy. Tell me, quickly. I'm happy, Christine. Especially happy to be here in your home. So, here is where you live. It's my first time here, but it feels like I've been before. This is exactly how I imagined your bedroom. I'd love to live here with you. It seems so reassuring and peaceful. Peaceful? Far from it. We're woken by army bugles every morning! Your library? Don't look. Why not? Schiller, Shakespeare and a dictionary. It only goes up to P. - Who's this chap with glasses? - Schubert, of course. Excuse me, Schubert, I didn't recognize you. That was the day that told me a big lie, remember? It's true. I didn't know how much I really loved you. A big lie that became a small truth. Our flowers from last Sunday! They've wilted a little. We'll pick more next Sunday. Next Sunday? You suddenly seem odd. Won't we go out on Sunday? It's just that I won't be here. I must go away tomorrow for a few days. Where? It doesn't really matter. A trip of no importance to see my parents. Franz, what's wrong? Nothing, I assure you. You'll be back, won't you? You'll be back one day? Of course I will. Why such worry? Because I've never loved before. And I'll never love again. It would be dreadful never to see you again. Franz, answer me. Say something! Remember the echo? - "I swear..." - No. These words are only for be said once ... but hear all your life. You change trains in Prague. There's a connection to Sadowa. Your parents' carriage will be at the station. We will have no reason to speaking, only by the lawyers. There. Adieu. Stop pacing up and down. We need to look calm. - Good evening. - Good evening, Franz. I have a few tips for you. As he has the first shot, only one thing you can do. You turn side-on, your weight spread on both legs. And stay completely immobile. And remember to wear dress uniform. No patent leather at sunrise. It's too shiny. Cigarette? One, two, three, four... It's time. Gentlemen, are you ready? - Ready. - Ready. And the second shot? The second shot? Why doesn't he shoot? Franz! My God! And Christine? Why aren't you at the Opera? What's going on? Out with it. Listen, Christine. The holidays are coming... We'll go away together. Wherever you wish. You always dreamt with Florence. Well, let's go there. What's wrong? Has something happened? Yes. Franz don't go back. He doesn't... He left a letter? He departed... For a long time? For ever. He's dead. This morning, in a duel. A duel? Over what? Tell me, Theo. You have no right to hide it from me. Why, Theo? Why did he fight a duel? I don't know why. Why not tell me the truth? Mizzie, you know. Tell me. Daddy, why? Why? Because of a woman. Because of that woman. Her husband killed him in a duel. He knew yesterday. He knew that we might never... And he left me with a smile. And this morning... died because of another. Yet he had sworn to love me always. He had sworn. And he died for another. No. It can't be true. It's not true! Then what was I to him? What was I? Nothing... nothing... He spoke of you all the time. He died thinking of you. If you want to see him again, come with us to his place. Now. Yes... I want to see him again. I want to see him again. See him again...
