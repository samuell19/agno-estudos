The style of Jeet Kune Do demands speed... accuracy and power. Master, Master... Someone else is here to challenge you. He's waiting outside. These fools, they'll never learn. Some tea for you, sir. Oh, thank you. Your tea, sir. You're no fighter. Catch. It's your move. Come on. You dare to challenge me? You're lucky I'm a fair man, Or else you'd be dead. Beat it. Challengers are everywhere. Everybody wants to be number one. Then something must be cooking. Yes, I was challenged, too. But you beat him, of course. Yeah. You mean the challenge came just out of the blue? That's right. Last week... I received a letter of challenge from a Korean master. He said people like you and I aren't as good as our reputation. Seems like quite a few people want to see us dead. He said if I didn't show up for the fight... he'd do something bad to my family. I was so intrigued by his letter, that I decided to show up. I'm not here because of your stupid threat. I just want to meet the man who's dumb enough to write that note. Come on, let's get it over with. Remember, kung fu is the art of self defense. I'm not interested in killing. I just want to prove how bad your kicks are. You must be talking about yourself. That's what we call control. Something you may never understand. Now my friend, listen. You'd better hope that we never meet again. If you dare to harm my family, you'll regret it. Because I swear, you'll never be able to kick again. I wonder what's behind all these challenges. But I don't think we need to fear them. What do you think? Someone may want us dead. Let them try. I think something will happen, something bad. Use staves. Power them like thunder. A visitor. So it is you. It's Billy Lo. Buddha's name be praised. Abbot. It's been a long time. Forgive me. I trust you're well. We've much to discuss. Abbot. The pigeons sensed your presence. But I'm afraid their swift departure is a bad omen. You must take care. I shall take your advice. Billy, remember this, No one is unbeatable. It's important that your brother learns from you. He's still making trouble? Since you're already here why not stay for a few days? Your brother would welcome it. I know what you mean. Bobby's a rebel. That's why I felt that I should come and see him. I've determined to make sure that he practices hard, work more, and I'll see that he stays clear of trouble. Actually, he doesn't appreciate what he has here... The chance to learn kung fu from a master... such as you. But if Bobby persists in being lazy, he must be punished. Be patient with him. He's still young and impatient. But I know him too well. So little training and he thinks he's good. But to become an expert, he has to study and practice harder! I'm sure he will take your advice. He's my only brother, and my father and I want him to succeed and pass on to others the benefits of kung fu. I understand that. I know, too, how much you care about him and his future. But when you talk to him, don't be too mean to him. Be sincere with him. Make sure he understands. And remember... When you were a child, you were also... always up to mischief. You didn't study hard. Instead you wandered the streets, stealing things. Yes, I remember that. I had no discipline, no principles, no respect for anybody. You weren't even afraid of the police. You also had that innocent look that would fool any adult... couldn't tell what that mischievous mind was up to. Hey, you little thief! You're stealing my... you were also a bully. I sure was. What did you do that for? Because I don't like you. And I hate you, too. I'll go tell your parents. I hope you'll get beaten. Fortunately, you didn't know any kung fu. You even attacked old blind men. As a martial artist I'd never do that. I'd forgotten I was such a terror. My goodness...so small, and you dare to attack an old man! Who cares if you're old? Only the strong survive. I'll kill you. Help... It was only later after you had grown up... and moved in with your sister, that you started listening to her pleas for self-discipline. Here, Mother wouldn't take my money. Of course she wouldn't. You got it by cheating at cards. At least I didn't steal it. I know how you feel. You're ashamed of me. I'm the black sheep of the family. Everybody despises me. I don't care what they say, Billy. Our mother and I care about what you do to yourself. Don't worry. I know what I have to do from now on. Mother, I've been wrong. But I understand now. I'll make sure you're proud of me. Now it's your brother's turn. He's still young, immature, full of his own ideas. I'm sure he'll soon change his outlook once you have a talk with him. I just hope that you're right. You've never failed. Go meet your brother. Right. Dear Bobby. How are you? I was hoping to see you... but you were out. I gather you're not studying or training so hard lately. I guess I don't have to tell you... that to become an expert in the art of kung fu you must practice more. There'll be time for girls later. Learn all that the Abbot teaches you. I'm leaving you my boxing manual. In the hope that you'll find it useful. Try to concentrate. Don't let Father and me down. Take care of yourself. Bye now. Your brother, Billy. "Mysterious Death of Famous Japanese Martial Artist Chin Ku" Died too suddenly. You haven't slept all night. Yes, I know. Sit down, Dad. Too bad about Chin Ku. Kung fu expert dies so young. That's right. Tell me. Do you think that he over-trained? There's nothing you can do now. Don't think too much. Try to get some sleep. Don't worry, father. I won't let it bother me. I'll attend his funeral in a few days. And I'd like you to represent me, too. You're not going? No. I'm far too old to travel, my son. It isn't wise. Think Bobby ought to come along with me? No, I'd rather he didn't go. He shouldn't be told of this. But why not, father? It's better that we shouldn't disturb the lad. Okay. In that case, I'll go alone. First thing to do is to look for his daughter. He has a daughter? The truth is, she's his stepdaughter. That's a surprise. He sure kept that quiet. Only his friends knew the truth. Do you know where she lives now? What's her name? Her name's May I think she sings at a club in Ginza. You'll have to make some inquiries. Welcome, Sir. What do you want? Who are you? I'd like to talk to you. Talk to me? I don't even know you. Don't let that bother you... because I know you. You must be crazy! You're talking rubbish. No, I'm not. I'm Li Chun Chang. I knew your father. We were good friends. Your father just died Aren't you ashamed of singing and enjoying yourself in here? Don't you feel any grief at all? I don't. So, he's dead. So what? Being sad won't bring him back. You seem to have very little respect for the old man. He never cared for me. So I sing to make a living. Nevertheless, you ought to respect him. He was your father. Some father! Where was he when Mother died? Forget the past. You bet I will. Nothing I can do about it now. Just pretend it never happened. I can't figure out why he died so suddenly? Chin Ku was a strong man, so full of life... It's strange. I don't know much about him at all. We hadn't been in contact for a long time. But he came to see me last month. If you lost contact for so long, why did he suddenly come see you? I don't know. But he left a box with me. He said to keep it safe. What is it? I'm not sure. A roll of film, I think. Where is the film? Can you show it to me? Here! Inside this box. I'm going in. Stay here and wait for me. I need a moment. What do you want? No one's allowed in here. I'm a good friend of Chin Ku's. I just want to pay my last respects to him. That's all. I told you, no one comes in. If you're wise, leave right now! Bobby, my son. Sadly I must tell you... that your brother, Billy, is dead. He was trying to find out why his friend Chin Ku died. He devoted his life to the art of kung fu. His own style of Jeet Kune Do... recorded for the benefit of everyone... in his books and manuals. My son, after you've read this letter... go to Japan and meet up with Sherman Ian. Find out who killed your brother. Seek revenge. Only then, will his soul rest in peace. Hey, Bobby! Hi Sherman! I'm sorry I'm a bit late. Just arrived myself. Let's go! This is all your brother left. It's a roll of film. I think you'd better have it. This dart is the weapon that was used to kill your brother. Do you have any idea why they wanted to steal Chin Ku's coffin? I've no idea. It's a mystery to me. It's all very strange. I don't understand. There must have been a reason. But what? Anyway, I'll take you to our master. He's waiting for you... Sherman, I'm going to get my revenge. Of course, we'll help you all we can. But you need to think it through carefully. What's this place? The Palace of Death. Who's that foreigner? That's Lewis. Master of the palace. Who's that guy? That's Lewis' valet. Oh, Chin Ku...What's he doing there? Well, he was Lewis' guest. They look like great friends. The valet's lost an arm. He doesn't look handicapped, though. He's very loyal to Lewis. Never leaves his side for a minute. What's Chin Ku doing...teaching Lewis kung fu? Seems that Lewis is interested in kung fu for the purpose of killing. Seems to enjoy it. The man is mad! It's strange...that Palace of Death. I think I'm going to check it out. Forget Lewis. His kung fu's not that hot. The Death Palace is a death trap. No one ever leaves that place alive! So please, be very careful. Master, there's a Bobby Lo to see you. Bobby Lo? Could he be Billy Io's brother? I wonder what that little punk wants with me? Tell the valet to show him in. Right. Maybe it's about Billy's death. So you are Mr. Bobby Lo. Welcome. I suppose you're Billy Io's younger brother. That's right. I hear the Palace of Death really lives up to its name. They say no one leaves here alive, like I walk into the valley of death. Not true. They're just vicious rumors. You know what people are like. People tell me you were a very good friend of Chin Ku. Yeah, his kung fu is excellent. I respect him. Perhaps even jealous of him. What are you trying to suggest? Chin Ku did spend some time here before, but I have nothing to do with his death. Is that right? Anyway, that's over, Let's forget it. Since you had the guts to come here, let me show you around. I think you'll find it interesting. I'm sure it'll be an experience. The pleasure's all mine. I'm impressed with your manners. Now, let's see if you have courage. Come on, I'm sure you'll find it fascinating. Now, look over there. I keep a lot of specially trained peacocks. They obey my every command. Peacocks obeying your command? That's quite remarkable. Exactly. It takes a lot of training. It's quite fantastic, isn't it? Look at that. Yeah. They're really big lions. God, I'm frightened! There are so many of them. They had them all imported from Africa. I selected the biggest and best of their breed. They have enormous appetites. And their favorite food is fresh, juicy, raw human meat. They all eat a lot, bones and all. Anyone who comes to challenge me, and then loses ends up as dinner for the lions. My challengers all try to act very tough. But not for long. I'm not surprised they're scared. I certainly hope I won't end up as their dinner tonight. Don't worry, friend. You won't. What are we waiting for then? Come on. Let's go. come on, ok? The lion is truly King of all beasts. They're the fastest and most powerful of all. A good martial artist should have the speed and power of a lion. Especially when fighting his enemies, he should be ruthless like the lion, a killer! Why do you keep the peacocks? I like the way they move. So swift and so sure. Martial artists should be fierce like a lion... and swift like a peacock... so I study their styles. An interesting theory. Sir, two men claiming to be the Yen brothers want to challenge you. Those two stupid fools! There are no match for me! All right Sun, take them to the cemetery first. Let them look around. May be then they'll change their minds. Sir. See. These are the gravestones of my master's challengers. I'm afraid you'll be joining them very soon. I'd leave now if I were you. Unless you want to die young. You can't make us change our minds. We're not afraid of him! Call him out here. It's rather late. What are you doing? Somebody has just attacked me. Someone attacked you? No way. No one would dare to. I just fought him off. Take it easy. We'll talk tomorrow. Morning! So you're an early riser, too. Have a seat. I hope I'm not interrupting your breakfast? Of course not. Why not join me? Great meal. This is raw venison. Deer's blood. Why not have some with me? No, thanks. Not my idea of a nice breakfast. About last night. Were you serious about that attack? Don't worry. It was all my fault. I really shouldn't have been out late anyway. There's nothing to stop you. You are my guest. Lewis. I know you mean me no harm... but I'm certain that someone here is plotting to kill you. Really? Who would dare to do that? What about your staff? Did you suspect any of them? Tell me...why did you employ your valet? Has he always been handicapped? Why ask about him? There's something strange about him. The fact is I suspect him. He's been with me for years. He used to be a monk. A monk? Yes, for the Fan Yu Temple. I was sorry for him. I hired him. Where is the Fan Yu Temple? Quite near here. There's rumor to be a Tower of Death. But then, no one has ever seen this tower. Why is that? Well, people say hundreds of years ago... An abbot called Hung Kuang built the tower under the ground. Excuse me, mister. Please leave us for a moment. I have something to discuss with Master. Hey, who are you? My name is Angel. Lewis asked me to come to keep you company. A drink? No, thanks. Don't touch it. Something else? A rest. I'm tired. Want to kill me? Everyone, quick! Master's been murdered! He's been with me for years. He was a monk before then. A monk? Yes, in the Fan Yu Temple Felt sorry for him. I hired him. People say that hundreds of years ago... an abbot called Hung Kuang built the tower of death. under the ground. Lewis asked me to keep you company. Do you want to kill me? Why did you kill Lewis? What do you gain by it? Funny way of being grateful! You killed Chin Ku, didn't you... but you tried to frame Lewis. What do you achieve by doing that? And you're the one who attacked me, aren't you? Where is the Tower of Death? Don't try to play dumb with me. I'll take a handicap. Just one hand. Even fairer, no hands. Now where's the Tower of Death? Take me there. Better speak up. I'm tired of playing games with you. Start talking or I'll tear you apart. Now where's the tower? You can go to hell! Cause I'm not afraid of you. I hate to tell you that hand will do you no good. Hey, who are you? Me? Jack the Ripper. You're still alive. Of course, I'm alive. No one can defeat me. But why did you pretend to be dead? You're asking too many questions. I'll let you go since you're Billy Io's brother. Get out while you can. It's your last chance. I'm not leaving here till I know the truth! Bobby Lo, you'd better stay out of this. Now get out before I change my mind. My brother died for you. He tried to prevent someone from stealing your coffin, and you had him killed! You're nowhere near to the truth, kid. I had nothing to do with his death. He was my good friend. Why should I kill him? I'm sorry. He brought it on himself. I might be a kung fu expert but I need cash. Drug trafficking was my answer. Now I can live in luxury forever. So you've been in this drug business for some time. That's correct, my boy. I really had to work hard to get where I am. You see there's a lot of competition. That's why I won't let anything stand in my way. If you value your life, you'd better leave right now. First tell me why you used the chopper... to steal your own coffin. Many people know that I'm in this business. I wanted to shake Interpol off my trail. I was afraid they'd check the coffin. Now, they have no evidence. You won't get away with this! Cause I intend to take revenge for my brother! Take revenge. You're not good enough. You'll never defeat me. And now I'll be more than happy to let you join your brother. You've asked for it, kid. It takes more than that to fight me. Chin Ku's deadly sword. I'll have to use Billy's Jeet Kune Do style.
