ALMOST HUMAN Sir, what type of car is this? Go away, it's dangerous to stay here. Is this car yours? I asked if this car is yours. - The car? - It's in a no-waiting area. I've got to fine you, alright? Will you decide or not? Lets go! The police! Go! Go! - Help, mummy! - Hurry up! Don't shoot, they've taken my child. Step on it, you idiot! Shut up! The clutch is slipping! Don't move! Quickly! Move! Mummy! Go faster or they'll get us! Come on, don't cry! Lets go! He had found out, he understood everything! What could I have done? - He nearly caught us. - No, you bastard! He would have found us, Mr Majone. You should have let him find you, get it? He asked for my license, what could I do? You should have made something up, you chicken! You almost made us kill a load of people, coward! I had to shoot! You lot, get lost! I had to shoot. I swear I had to shoot. Enough! Enough! Please! I couldn't do anything else. Enough! Enough! I beg you, don't touch me. Get out of my sight forever, before I crush your balls, if you've got any. Let's go. I'm coming. I'm coming! - Good evening, Mrs. Clerk - What do you want at this hour? I need cash. Come in. I need a load of money. - What's happened? - That's my business. What do you think happened? I need money. - So, what's new? - Give it to me, come on! Bad luck, I'm broke. You're not broke, you're old! Here's the poor old countess. She's so ugly when she sleeps! - Can't you see how ugly she is? - Stop it, you'll wake her. Stop it, Iona, you also think I'm... - a good for nothing, don't you? - Come on, Giulio! I think that if you really wanted to, you could try to work. It becomes a habit, you know? Work? Don't make me laugh! Should I go and sell apples or be a brick-layer? Imagine what it must be like in winter, with the Milan weather. Selling your life 8 hours a day every day until you drag your feet towards a state-run home. While there are people like your boss who make millions and put it all in Switzerland. - You think that's fair? - What are you doing? What are you looking for? - The money. Where did you put it? - I don't have any. Iona, don't try and be clever with me. Where did you put it? I told you, I haven't got any. Don't play clever with me. Where did you put it? - Listen, Giulio... - You are a pain in the arse! You like it when I fuck you, eh? No? And you don't even pay me. You didn't give me a present today. When you drink you become stupid and you feel like Napoleon, don't you? Napoleon had a cock like this, you've seen the paintings? I'll make you see Napoleon, you bitch. Now I'll show you. And you think I thrashed her for this shit here? Do me a favour! When you take a risk... it's for something big! It's a battle! A battle! And in these cases you can also get kicked! - It's part of the risk. - How much did you get? Definitely more than us two make in a week, Carmine. Well, well! Crafty, Vittorio. You shit. You shit! Aren't you ashamed? - Look. - What? That's 300 lire! What can you do with 300 lire? 300 lire! You really make me sad! If you talk, talk about millions! Three million, thirty million... Otherwise it's best to die of hunger. You should be ashamed of snatching handbags, it's just shit. So go whoring with your handbag! You're pathetic! - You're right. - So, shall we go? - I'll piss on bag snatching! - What an idiot! He just talks! When you see a policeman you shit yourself! Go sell your arse! - I shit on the knife! - You're full of shit! Very good! Now we'll take a walk to the police station! Let's go! 600 lire. This man died for 600 lire. Has the family been told? Headquarters had already done so, Inspector Grandi. You can take him away. Get them to take prints from the edges and the buttons, even though it'll be pointless. Inspector? Inspector, where can you go for cigarettes at this hour? What the hell are you laughing at? Show respect for the dead! Bye, see you tomorrow! - What are you doing here? - Don't get angry. I know you're embarrassed to be seen with me. Stop it! I even put on a new jacket to look good for you. I'm, glad to see you. Who's that? Has the boss got a new slave? You go, I'll take her. Stop it, she's the Commendatore's daughter. - Only child? - Yes, if you marry her you get it all. Don't be cheeky! - Let's go. - Where? To your home. - If only it was always like this! - Why? I'd live with you. You are such a bitch! How disgusting! You'd live with me! You're ashamed... even when I just pick you up at the office! Because I'm a poor man. Because I'm not... a gentleman. Oh, stop it, Iona! Don't put on an act, you don't have to fake it with me. Don't try to deceive me or I'll get angry Listen... Talking of which... What's your boss's daughter called? - Mary Lou, why? - How old is she? Don't know... about twenty. Well, well! Twenty and all that bread! If I could organize a nice kidnapping for half a billion I'd be set for life. Giulio, trust me. It'd be better if you did the pools. I've got to do the pools? Perhaps, and the lottery too, eh? Iona, look... you've only got to lend me the car. I... I'll find two friends. - In fact, I've already found them. - So? I'll kidnap the girl, then I'll hide her some place... and the Commendatore... he'll pay, you'll see. Giulio, it's stupid. Come on, lend me the car. Then I swear I'll give you... I can't say love, but I'll keep screwing you for the rest of your life. Oh, come on... We'll never catch him. On that pump we found the fingerprints of everybody in Milan. A man who kills this way has something else on his conscience, or he's mad. The whole city's becoming a mad-house. And we're the targets in the game. 3 policemen: 50 lire. We're in trouble, I'm telling you. There's no choice but to hope for a tip-off. - You've started the ball rolling? - 10 road-blocks. We stopped 31 people, got two car thieves caught in the act. One of the thieves was already out by this evening. He asked me for a light. They're right to make fun of us. Sadly we only catch them rarely, and when we do, they let them out in 24 hours. Rest assured he'll steal another car by this evening. And if a night watchman nabs him, he'll just stab away. If I catch one, I swear to you I'll shoot instead of arresting him. It's talk. Just talk. If something's certain, there's no risk. Anyone can pocket a ransom. But then the cops go into action and screw you. Know why they screw you? Because the mugs free the hostage. Whereas if you kill him... there's no risk. No proof, no leads, nothing... - Yes, but... - But? - It's murder. - Why murder? It's self-defense. Boys, only one thing counts: either you have money and you're someone or you don't have any and you're a doormat. - You can be convincing. - I'm talking about half a billion. You know how much half a billion is Do you know how much half a billion is, my little tobacconist? It's... It's... 500 million! "500 million"... see how it fills your mouth. Just like a whore. - Giulio, do you want to kidnap the mayor? - Forget politicians. With things as they are today... they'll give you 500 million butterflies. - I know who. - Who? Who? Who? See how good I am. If there's someone worth half a billion... it's her. We'll combine business with pleasure, as they say. Beautiful! Boys, it's a bit late to back out now. You're already in. - Thanks. - No problem, Mary Lou. My name's Giulio! Why did you say your name? Because I'm polite, we're not risking anything. Now we've got to go and get a car. - Are we going to steal it? - Yes, from someone who won't report it. We need a clean number plate. Let's go! - Are you sure? - Yes, I've got it in the car. - Come on, I'm starving! - You're always hungry. Come on... - Well? - They stole my car. - You're joking? - I left it here! What now? - Let's go and eat. - But you've got to report it! No, maybe my boyfriend took it. In fact, he definitely took it. As if they'd steal that rust-box! Not hungry any more? - Who is it, daddy? - The usual people. They're all idiots, fuck them! Still on the ball, dad? Weren't you with Majone? I recognized you straight away. Tell me, are you still with Majone? Yes, but now I want to do it alone. - Daddy, I need 3 rosaries. - A novena? No, a funeral mass. Fuck them! Keep calm! We've got to help the youngsters! Why do you call him "daddy"? He's old. It's not that he did my mother, poor woman. I never met her. Which services? A prayer is good if it's done in advance. 0therwise it's worthless. Arms are 100,000 each returnable when empty. Really! Daddy wants 100,000 to rent a submachine gun. If you fire them, 3 Pater, Ave e Glorias for 6 months. And for receiving grace: remission of sins. So if we perforate someone with these, you'll keep the deposit. That's the commandment. So, Pater, Ave e Gloria. 300,000 times 3 gives a total of... 900,000. But if they don't catch us for 6 months, you'll return the money, right? They put two of mine in the clink last week. Immediate loss of two rosaries. They're rare goods. Rare goods, right. Fuck them! She's got a problem with us, eh? Mother isn't in anymore. In my day Nina asked 10 lire a fuck in the Piazza del Duomo while everyone was singing "If I could have 1,000 lire a month...". - I had a lot of money then! - And men banging your wife! Nina brought me 1,000 lire a day! Alright, it's a deal. 300 plus 900... 1,200,000, fine. But we haven't got any money. They're embarrassed, daddy. They're embarrassed because we haven't got the money. Boys, you're Majone's friends. Pay me when you want. We don't like debts, daddy. Daddy! What did they do to you? Coward! - Are you crazy? - Give me the gun. Will they put you in Purgatory after all those tricks? Quick! Quick, they're swindling us! What need was there to kill them? You talk and talk, but it's you who gives importance to money. Of course I give it importance, but it's negative. Why don't you kiss me now? - Because I love you. - What do you do when you love a woman? Stop it, you make me feel stupid. Mary Lou, try and understand, I want to marry you, but... - But? - It's a question of principle. Gianni, my father's got the money, not me. So tell your father that you don't want any of it. You know what our kids will say? "Dad, you're useless, we want granddad's bread". And I want you... Beautiful, Mary Lou, just beautiful! Boys, a chance like this won't come to us again! Never again! When she sees a ball she loses her bearings! She's not sure if what she's got in her hand is a cock or a racket. Hey, hey! What's up, tobacconist? You're thinking about the old people? Don't think about them, they're not thinking any more. Here. Wait. Have one, take it. - Take it. - What is it? This was invented by people who go to university for us who didn't, so that we don't have to bother about it. Come on. - Come on! - I don't want it. You said you don't want it? Tobacconist, it's too late to change your mind. Listen, from now on you'll do what I tell you. Understood? Giulio's got a rule: "Who ever knows is in and who ever knows but isn't in... - croaks". - Let's not argue. Carmine's in. Right, Carmine? Of course he's in, open your mouth. - What if it makes me feel bad? - I said open your mouth. Like this. Like this. Look. Pay attention, see how I do it. Come on. it's good for you. Come on, for god's sake! Done. Mary Lou No Gianni, don't open it! Don't open it, they're armed! We're hungry! We're hungry, understand? Please, don't open it! Miss Mary Lou, we're hungry! No! Sister, the Archangel Gabriel sent us to protect your virginity. Gianni, don't be stupid! Gianni! Don't look at me like that. Don't look at me like that! I said don't look at me like that! You're good, boy! Giulio! Giulio, she's escaped! I'll get you. I swear I'll get you, bitch. What happened to you? An accident? Come in! - Romano, who is it? - Marta, go and see. Before someone gets you into trouble. - What happened? - She must have had an accident she's feels bad. A car accident? Maybe someone else has been injured. Close the door and the windows. - What did she say? - I don't know, she's raving. For me the oil crisis is a good thing. Every one on foot like the old days and you even improve your health. Come on, at your age, you couldn't do without a car. - Try to calm down. - They've killed Gianni! Drink, drink. You'll suffocate her like that! You can't do anything! One perfect person in the family's enough! Give me a drop, these things make me feel empty here. Fill up the old man too, so, later we can be alone. Sweetie, a little cognac? And the coronaries? If I feel bad you'll have to be at my bedside all night. Hey! She's talking about a robbery! The girl says men with machine guns attacked her. Liar! Yes, she's a liar! Don't believe her, she's a liar. What do you want from us? We don't even know the girl. But now you know me, you worm. You murdered Gianni! You killed Gianni... Quiet, liar! We won't say anything, take the girl away. I beg you! We're not saints. Right, but he wants to pray. You want to pray, right book-keeper? On your knees. On your knees! On your knees! You too, quickly! Boys, if you need a little bread I can pay. Vittorio, lock her in the bathroom. Here, like this. Pull the chain. Listen, I don't know if you agree... but I've always found people who live only for money a bit disgusting. Yes, there are other values in life aren't there? For example... brotherly love. You know about brotherly love, eh? Let's see if you're up to it. Up to brotherly love, come on. What are you waiting for? But... I can't. I'm for sexual equality, I'm not bothered. Come on, book-keeper. Cover him. An old friend, Walter. Three sentences for robbery, but all stuff before the war. Seemed he'd calmed down, but... he trafficked arms. She was an ex-prostitute. They were together their whole lives and they died together. Right, the same old story. He dealt in arms for 30 years without us realizing it. Obviously he only sold his wares to people he knew well. So it's got to be someone from his own crowd who cheated him. Whoever killed him urgently needed to procure this stuff We'll soon get news about him, you'll see. You think so? Relax, haven't you ever played roulette? Come on, Giulio, it's your turn. - A million on red. - Two million. See the million on the black. Spin, spin! I owe you a million, but I want to do this red-head first! Beautiful red-head! Giulio, somebody's here. Floriana Floriana Answer, Floriana! Murderer, coward! Murderer! Pig, you killed her! You killed my daughter! Floriana! - My daughter! - That's enough! - Have you seen him before? - Of course, he was Mary Lou's friend. - You knew they went out together? - Yes, I knew. - What's happened to my daughter? - We'll do every thing we can to find her. - Why did they kill him like that? - I don't know. There aren't any reasons. Some days ago, right in the center of Milan, they stabbed a night watchman to death for 600 lire. 9mm Sten. If it's the same machine gun that killed the old couple, then they didn't even let it cool down. There's worse to come. Inspector Grandi, please come, there's been a massacre. In a villa, five dead! - Nobody can go in. - Let me past. - Please let me go up. - I'm sorry, nobody can. - You know this man? - No, never seen him. A 7 year old girl. Same caliber. - Almost certainly the same weapon. - Get them to check. - Mr Porrino, you are very wealthy? - Yes. So there's hope. For your daughter, I mean. It might be a kidnapping. So I'm ready to pay whatever they want. Any sum. Perfect. One of us must always be here. In fact, two's better. Mary Lou, darling. Don't be afraid. When daddy coughs up, you'll play tennis again and get screwed in your car, dirty girl. Life's great, eh? - Are we safe here? - 0f course. We're safe here... only if we're sure. Shit, things got a little bit out of hand last night. Right, but maybe it's for the best. So Scrooge McDuck won't think we're joking. We're definitely in it up to our necks now, all three of us half a billion on the one hand and a life sentence on the other. Unless we stop asking for a ransom... Maybe we were just crazy and drunk, last night. They'll put us in a hospital. In San Vittore prison. Maybe not... Carmine, what the hell's up? - Why are you squirming like that? - I don't feel well. - You don't feel well? - No. The party made you sick, eh? Listen... listen. You can feel sick if you want, but try and find a bush instead of shitting yourself here. God can take a shit. But if you take one step past the bushes, I'll stop the diarrhea with this. Have I made myself clear, angel? I only said I felt sick, but I'll tell you something else. You're not smart you're a poor fanatic. That's enough! What happened, happened. And you weren't exactly collecting daisies last night. You're right, Giulio, we've got to finish this. - There's no other choice. - We're three filthy murderers. Really? I'm still getting used to it. Go and take a shit! Hurry up. I've got to go. - Keep an eye on him. - He does what I tell him. And you do what I tell you. All right? Giulio, why don't we get the girl to write the letter straight away? Too early. We mustn't give the impression we're in a hurry. Because people in a hurry are scared. Get it? The "Font of Wisdom". What the hell do you have in that hard head of yours? If you needed the car, you could have phoned me. What's yours is mine and what's mine belongs to who? Still yours, Giulio! Great! Great! I told you I needed your car for a job worth half a billion. Giulio, you haven't done anything stupid? No, I killed three men, two women and a girl. - Very funny. - Great, eh? Iona, listen... Forget the paper. What do you care about the papers? - Listen... - What? Joking apart, If I told you that... I'd killed someone, what would you do? - I'd go to the police. - Really. You can bet on it. - I don't believe you. - I'd go straight to them. I was about to report you about the car! Really? - You're evil. - Sure. You're evil, but I'm good. And you know why I'm good? Instead of taking you to the office, I'm taking you to the lakes. Yes... but I need to keep my job. Maybe you're right, though. Nobody will die if I don't go to the office one day. 0f course. I told you to forget the paper. - I'll tell you a joke. - Okay. A negro goes to university and the dean asks him: "Which field are you in?" And the negro replies: "Won't they give me a desk?" What a sight. Beautiful. You know this Iake's one of the deepest in the world? You know you're really strange this morning? Am I? Since when have you been interested in the depth of lakes? You want me to be interested only in your depths? You always end up there. Look. 3 MEN, 2 WOMEN AND A GIRL KILLED. KIDNAPPED A YOUNG GIRL. You... - ...You really did it? - 0f course. Maniac. Murderer! Leave me alone! No! Leave me alone! No! Leave me alone! TORTURED AND KILLED INDUSTRIALIST PORRINO'S DAUGHTER DISAPPEARS - Who is it? - They got in touch. I'm on my way. Maybe this is it, inspector. How much is she worth to you? How do I know you have my daughter? It's Porrino's phone. You've got to trust us. How is my daughter? Don't hurt her, I beg you! Let me speak to Mary Lou now! - Commendatore... - Let me speak! I'll pay what you want, but I must know she's alive! Okay, you'll have proof she's alive. But if you want to see her again in one piece, no police. Clear? - What? - No police. Yes, yes! I'll do anything. - That's all for now. - Be kind, give me some proof. Hello? Hello? Inspector, from the Piazza Cordisio metro station. - Why don't you send someone? - To watch the trains leaving? Lambrusco. Disgusting, I haven't eaten yet! But it will do for this pill. When I receive the money from your daddy, I'll have a champagne bidet every morning. Understand, lovely Mary Lou? Write! Listen to him, write what he says or he'll beat you up. He can't wait. I can't wait. Write: "Dear daddy", Well... if I write... you'll kill me afterwards. Mary Lou, I've got nothing against you. Like when you stick your knife in a steak, you don't think about the poor cow, right? But you've got to live anyway. Your daddy's got a lot of money and I haven't... If I'd asked him for it he wouldn't have given it to me, right? If I write and my father pays... you'll kill me, you'll kill me anyway. That's why it doesn't matter if I see your face. You've enjoyed life until now, haven't you? I want that too. Twenty years of riches and then I swear I'd even shoot myself. You'll never get anything from me! Nothing! Kill me if you want, I'm not writing anything. If she screams like that someone might hear her. You know, Mary Lou, there are many ways to die. One's like this. But it doesn't last long. Another's like this... and it lasts even less time. Or I could pull out your eyes. I could send you to your father with your eyes in your hands like Saint Lucia. He's not going far, he's sick. Alright. Seeing as you don't want to write, lets see if you'll be useful for something. - Come on here! - No, leave me alone! - Vittorio, do her! - No! Come on! Do it! Maybe you prefer her like this! Well, come on! Come on! Vittorio, come on! Come here, come on! Wow let her alone. She'll write, you'll see! That's enough, Giulio. Now you've got it, haven't you? So take the pen and write. Write! "Dear daddy, they want 500 grand." No, erase"grand". Put "500 million". Comma. "If not they'll ass-fu... No, erase that, or your father will think we're scum. "Otherwise they'll put my head in the toilet bowl and they will pull the chain". No, strike "the chain" seems like a joke. "They'll put my head in the toilet bowl. I love you, Mary Lou". Vittorio, hop over to Switzerland. Post it and come back. It'll take you 4 or 5 hours by bus. Go! Lift it! Lift it! - What's going on? - An accident. They've fished out a woman, must have fallen in with the car. Cartridge "A", from the villa massacre. Cartridge "B", found next to Mary Lou Porrino's car. Cartridge "C", found in the tinsmith's shop. All fired by the same machine gun. The firing pin is displaced by three-tenths of a millimeter. It's as if it signs the bullets it fires. If he carries on shooting, he'll solve our traffic problems. - A woman in the lake: interested? - Alright, I'm coming. Fished out two hours ago. - Well? - You told me to point out the dead. She's dead, isn't she? Iona Tucci, Milan. 26 Via Solferino. Doesn't prove anything, they print half a million copies a day. You're right, keep me informed. She worked for Porrino. - What? Who are you talking about? - The dead woman. A good girl, she worked for us for three years. - When did it happen? - Yesterday morning, she ended up in Lake Como with her Mini. If she'd come to work regularly, she wouldn't be dead. - Looks like they pushed her in. - Pushed her in? Do you think there could be a connection with... I don't know. We can't say yet. But it's a suspicious coincidence. No news? None, for now. They'll call again, here or at home. The ransom request almost always follows the first call. That's the routine. Can I talk to some of the poor woman's colleagues? Of course, come with me. Taxi! - Where are we going? - To the left, go. - Was he seeing Iona for long? - A year. I'm first! You're sure Giulio Sacchi lives here? I think so, I came here once with Iona. Wait for me. Hey, little boy. Which floor for Giulio Sacchi? He lives on the sixth floor but he's never here. Go! It's your turn! Because you won Jack! What do you have to do? Do like every one else, stupid! You raise the price of the drinks. Remember my kickback, clear? Who is it? What do you want? Listen, Majone, listen. You've got to do me a favour, you know how I am, a bit of a chicken. Wait, because people are a little nervous around here. You told me I'm a chicken, didn't you? Listen to me, if I get angry I'll sing. - You trying to threaten me? - I'll sing, Majone. - From the bank to the billiards. - You trying to threaten me? - You know what I can do to you? - Listen, Majone, listen. I don't know where I'll end up, but I know where you'll wind up. I know where you'll wind up if you don't do what I tell you. According to what the landlady said, he was the only man who went out with that poor woman. We've got to find him right away. It's unlikely he's involved in the kidnapping. But... Maybe he's not involved but someone drowning in a car they'd stolen from her the day before... Makes you curious, doesn't it? When did he disappear? For example, she didn't go to work yesterday. Nor today. - You're the husband? - No... - Family? - No, I'm... We are... really good friends. You've got to find a man from Sesto San Giovanni. He's called Giulio Sacchi. Yes, Giulio Sacchi. Sir - I'm Giulio Sacchi. - Wait a moment. - What did you say? - Giulio Sacchi, it's my name. - You're from Sesto San Giovanni? - Yes. Forget it, I've already found him. What's happened, sir? Why are you here? He's come to report the disappearance of his girlfriend. - Iona Tucci? - Yes, Iona Tucci. - What's happened, sir? - An accident. - An accident? - Come with me. Iona's dead, right inspector? Have we met before? I don't know but tell me the truth, is Iona dead? Yes, in the lake, with the car. What? She told me they'd stolen the car. Maybe it's not her, inspector. Oh god, Iona! My dear Iona... Iona's dead! When did she tell you they'd stolen the car? The day before yesterday. I called her and told her I couldn't go out. - Do you have any previous? - What do you mean, "previous"? Previous convictions. Have you already been involved with the police? Previous? I'm a clean person! Clean! Get them to check. Where were you at night the day before yesterday? At billiards. When Iona didn't want to, I... I've always been alone, ever since I was small nobody loved me. Only Iona loved me! Why are you asking these questions? I'm a man who's suffering! Why the questions? Because I believe someone threw her in the lake. We've taken less because of the Vice Squad. - 30%? - Almost. Only the Idroscalo and Lambro are saving us. - The girls are scared. - Boss... The police are here with that chicken, Giulio. You stay here, I'll kill him later. Make yourself comfortable, inspector. Anselmo, whiskey. No, no. You know this man? Sure. He come here sometimes. Try to be precise, it's about a murder. Where do I fit in? When did you last see him? - Who, him? - No, your grand mother. - Just a minute... - Mr Majone, we played poker until dawn. Oh, yes! Yesterday, no... yes, two days ago. So, can I go, inspector? Why? You're with friends, aren't you? I'll give you some advice. Sleep at home at night for a while. - I may have to come and wake you. - Alright, inspector. Now I'll chop your balls off. No you won't, the inspector counts them every night. I'd have to explain where I left them. One wrong word and I'll put you six feet under. - Hello? - You'll get the proof tomorrow morning. We want 500 million in two suitcases 5 and 10,000 lire used notes. Understand, Commendatore? Alright, but don't harm her. I'll give you the money. My daughter won't say anything, there's nothing to be afraid of. Two suitcases with 250 million weigh a lot, nobody needs to carry them. - We'll tell you the place afterwards. - Yes. Please do it quickly! - Don't be in a rush. - Hello? Hello? Quick, take it to the inspector. Come on, eat. You'll just make it worse. I can't... anyway... - Every thing okay, tobacconist? - Yes, everything's fine. Don't make that face, it's nearly over. The old man's bitten and he'll pay. Life's good, eh? A good lunch... The 500 million's on its way, boys. 500 million divided by 3 is... 200 million for me and 150 for each of you. What can you do with 150 million? Giulio, don't kill her. She won't say anything if we save her life. You've got a crush on her! It's gutless to get paid and kill her anyway. You think it's gutless? You know what gets me in the guts? Being born without bread or the chance of making any. That's gutless! Don't you understand we're in a jungle? And then... didn't we agree... on the kidnapping, the bread and the six feet under? Tell me, yes or no? I know, but it seemed easier before, at least for me. Don't you think we've killed enough people? No. Not while there's just one who could put us in prison. And to prove to you that I'm not joking... I'll tell you that I also killed my girlfriend. What? I killed my woman. I threw her in the lake with the car and everything. You know why? Because she knew too much. The cow would have betrayed me. That's why. They found her today, and tomorrow they'll get you and us with you! Let go of my hand, Vittorio, alright? Who do you think you are? You and this shit here. Two street tarts! That's what you are! But remember that if your pockets are full one day you owe it to me! Alright, I killed her! So? And I went to the police, so? Listen to me. We won't leave evidence. I won't leave evidence. We'll hide the money for 1, 2, 3 or 4 years if necessary. We've got nothing to worry about. We won't have alibis. Who cares about alibis? Alibis can be made up. You, for instance. Where were you on Monday last week? Come on, where were you Monday? See? And you? Where were you on the 26th of last month at 3:10 pm? Come on! Boys, we're people who live from day to day! What effing alibi should people like us have? Loads of people have seen us together in the bar. Who cares! What does it mean? What have we done wrong? Is it a crime to be in a bar? I don't get it. Be careful, that's all. We give the dust time to settle and the dust settles. A dead person isn't news these days. When the police search in the dark, they're the first to want to forget it. Lets hope it goes like you say. But we've got to get on with it. 0nce the letter's arrived it'll all be over in 24 hours. I swear on my filthy life. From Switzerland but your daughter's certainly much closer. I'm ready to pay, Superintendent. You must get them to interrupt the investigation. I want my daughter to come home and then... It's a mistake to pay and put yourself in the hands of those murderers. There's nothing else for it, the money doesn't matter to me. You recall that terrible massacre carried out in that villa? Believe me, it's stupid to try dealing with such criminals. Even if you pay, they'll still kill your daughter. I've got to try and save her anyway. We've got to stop helping criminals get away with it. And you want to stop them using my daughter's life? Mr Porrino, don't you want to see how things really stand? If you pay, you have no hope of ever seeing her alive again. They've already murdered a lot of people. They'll do anything. Why should they run the risk of letting her live? Inspector, may I decide about my daughter, or do you want to decide? Superintendent, he's been threatened, but not us. You're wrong there, inspector, we're all threatened. Do you have some good reason to propose a more realistic alternative? Yes, if Mr Porrino decides to collaborate. - What do you want to do? - I'll collaborate. I'll collaborate, but afterwards! Afterwards will be too late to save your daughter and it'll also be too late for justice. Please make them suspend the investigation, Superintendent. 0ne or two days. Suspend surveillance for 48 hours. What are you doing? Solitaire? Where are we going? I don't know about you, I'm going to sleep. - Two days holiday. - And these? - Surveillance has been suspended. - Orders from the big boss? Yes, we've got to leave the kidnappers in peace or they'll get scared and won't get their money. Got a cigarette? I'm out. Me too. I checked out Sacchi. Clean criminal record. Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm sure I have seen him somewhere. I should get some sleep. Inspector, where do you go for cigarette at this hour? Hello? Did you receive the letter? Good, listen to me. 0pen your ears and no tricks. It's tonight at 11. Seventeenth milestone on the old lakes road. Come alone and with the money. He's coming. Let's hope he hasn't made a mess of it. - Well? Did it go all right? - Yes, I placed all five. Well done. Lets hope it's true because... A treasure hunt must be well organized. or it will all go wrong. Isn't it dangerous to get him to leave the money right there? Dangerous? No, you don't get it, do you? They'll never think of it. That's the genius of Giulio Sacchi. Who's the kidnapper who gets them to take the money to his home? Only me, because I am a gentleman! Because... Stop wanking will you? - Vittorio, go to the place in Cernusco. - Alright. Make sure that the Commendatore's got no-one in front of or behind him. Check the air too, understand? - The police have learned how to fly. - Alright. And you, angel, go to the place in Segrate. It's 3 kilometers on foot. Anyway, daddy is here. If something goes wrong, don't worry. Stay where you are. I've done 150 kilometers on the scooter can't I stay here? No! Open up your ears and no tricks. It's tonight at 11. 17th milestone on the old lakes road. Come alone and with the money. Thank you, you are a friend. Yes, but try not to create problems. If the girl dies we are all in trouble. Don't worry. Get ready with the car, we are leaving right now. Call the Como Traffic Police Command. Km. 10 A4 MOTORWAY CERNUSCO EXIT What up? Please, I'm in a hurry. Documents, please. Here, but be quick, I am in a hurry. - I'm sorry it's not in order - What do you mean? - Get out, come with me. - Please, I can't. Phone the Superintendent, he knows me. I'm Commendatore Porrino. You still need to have your documents in order. I repeat, I have the Superintendent's permission. What do you want from me? If the police have learned to fly it's in order to get the birds. LEAVE THE CASH BY THE RIVERSIDE IN 24 HOURS WE WILL FREE THE GIRL That's it, my lovely. Let go. The other one too. Well done. Well done. You should be happy. You've got a daddy who loves you. You know what a friend of mine once said who thinks he's better that anyone else? That I was a chicken. Get it? I was a chicken. You think so too? Tell me what you think of me. Go on, tell me what you think of me. Say it! You are just a shit full of drugs. It's over you shit! No! Why did you do it? No! Stop it, Carmine. Coward, coward! - Don't play stupid with me - Coward. Don't be stupid with me! Shit! You shouldn't have done that Carmine. I heard the machine gun. You... Yes, I killed her. I killed her - We'll hide her later. - I wonder how Carmine will take it. I don't care about Carmine anymore. Not, that... the suitcases are up there. - Seen anyone on your way here? - No, no-one. Is it a good idea to get them? We'll have to, sooner or later. Well... better sooner than later. Come on, lets do it. Quick. Lets go. Half a billion in a suitcase worth 100,000. We're set. If you use one to wipe your ass every day, you got enough for 20 years. Maybe it was worth getting rid of someone for this. 0f course it was. Did you doubt my genius? I've cleaned everything too, so we won't leave any prints. Carmine should be here by now, if everything went smoothly. Everything went smoothly, Vittorio, it always goes smoothly with me. But if Carmine hasn't returned maybe we're in danger already. Carmine's been already. He's over there... dead. I killed him because he wanted to defend that tart. - He attacked me from behind. - Are you crazy? - Carmine was my friend. - So what? He was my friend too. If they find him dead here, they'll catch me! It's your fault! They'll find you as well! This way they won't catch you. They definitely won't catch you. You won't trick me, idiot. - Surround the boat! - Quickly, get down! Don't worry about me, move it! There is a suitcase here! Let's go. - The girl's dead. - Too late. Sacchi. I bet it was Sacchi. Maybe, but keep calm. He couldn't have got very far. Good, I'll sort you out. That's enough. That's enough. I'm Ugo Majone, I want to talk to Inspector Walter Grandi. You stay here as well - He's not here. - We were conned. Leave two guards. We'll sweep the area tomorrow morning. Okay, but lets get you to the hospital now. A communication for Inspector Grandi. That's me, speak. Sacchi has been seen in Cologno Monzese. The Majone billiard hall. I repeat, Cologno Monzese. - Good, lets go right now! - Your leg! Don't worry about my leg. Lets go. Hurry up! He's a swindling bastard who would cheat his mother. That's not true, they beat me because I was winning and they didn't want to pay me. A little game among friends. But it's the principle that counts. They messed him up like that then they slipped away. They did the right thing, even if it was against the law. In any case I don't want any trouble. And I informed you immediately. Dry! You've changed son of a bitch! What are you doing? He didn't keep his cards there! Quiet, keep quiet. This pig killed a lot of people. and if you are covering up for him Majone, this time you are finished. He killed a lot of people? Then put him away for life, so he'll stop cheating his friends. Yes, right. Understood. - How long's he been here? - I don't know. I've got better things to do than keep an eye on that lout. Roughly? Three or four hours. The tussle started an hour ago. Friends, keep me out of trouble! Did you get the question? When did this shit start? Between eleven and midnight Mr Majone. Arrest all of them! My head... - All of them! - Lean on me. An ambulance, quick! They'll keep you in until the trial. Tell me where the suitcase is? - Or don't you trust me? - No, I trust you. I trust you, but let's wait till I'm out. Get out, out! - Get out! Clear? - Keep your hands off! You too! I've done nothing! They beat me up because I was winning. This one even called me a "little turd"! - Come on, quickly get out! - I'll show you! Let's go, Majone! PUBLIC PROSECUTOR Come in. - Did you understand Sir? It's a legal point. - Yes, yes. - Hello. - How are things? Nobody can say that I don't proceed cautiously. - Please sit down. - Thank you. Inspector, I'm pleased to see you after all that's happened. I am sorry but my client is completely uninvolved. Who's your client this time? That poor jobless man, Giulio Sacchi. Clean as a whistle. With a cast iron alibi and no evidence which could justify his staying in prison for three weeks. It's a typically Italian scandal. I spoke to the President of the Higher Court yesterday. I see. Might I ask what money that poor jobless man is paying you? Your fees are very high. Don't offend me. I didn't embrace this profession for money alone. - When an innocent citizen... - Innocent citizen? He's paying the witnesses and you too, sir. With Mr Porrino's money. This is an insult, I protest! Oh please, I have examined the documents. There is nothing to incriminate him, Inspector. Are you quite sure Judge? I have no doubt that Giulio Sacchi was the killer. Have you seen the photos of the cartridges in the report? The machine-gun with which he shot at us was the same as the one with which he killed all the others. Yes, we've got the evidence that it was the same machine-gun. But we're not giving a machine-gun a life sentence. and there is no hard evidence that connects it to Sacchi. Who else? When we found the night watchman dead, he was there. I saw him. And it was his girlfriend we fished out of the lake. Her colleagues confirmed that he picked her up outside her office. He first saw Mr Porrino's daughter there. The bodies on the boat were Giulio Sacchi's friends! Who, moreover, disappeared on the day of the kidnapping. Isn't that evidence, Judge? Suspicions, coincidences, clues maybe. But not enough for a court. I have to have him released Inspector, I'm sorry. You're sorry? Tell that to that poor man, Porrino. Tell that to the people he massacred in the villa. Alright, you let him out. and then ask him forgiveness in the name of the Italian people. When he mows someone else down we'll have him on our conscience. Preventing crimes is your job, Inspector. You'll receive copy of the release order. He's just doing his job. It's us who aren't able to do ours. As Giulio Sacchi has shown. They want evidence as big as the Pirelli skyscraper to give someone a life sentence. You can do anything here if you got this. Don't you read the newspapers, you bunch of illiterates? We're talking about 200...300...400 hundred million if it's not a billion, a billion and a half. How are they going to catch them? When are they going to catch them? - You're right. - Giulio, a cripple's looking for you. A cripple? What does a cripple want from me? - He's been looking for you for three days. - A cripple? What are you doing? Where are you going? How's it going, sir? Looking for me? They told me at the police headquarters about the accident you had. I'm sorry, come and join me. Will you have some? Look, it's French champagne. They told me about your leg. Listen, about that thing, I'm not involved, I can explain. - You don't have to explain anything. - Inspector, I... Get ready, Sacchi, you're finished. What do you mean, "finished"? I haven't done anything. I condemn you to death for kidnapping, violence and massacre. Listen, look... - Inspector, just a minute! - Stop! The police can't shoot! Stop! The police can't shoot, Inspector! There's no proof! There's no proof against me, Inspector! He's crazy! He's crazy! He's crazy! Inform the Public Prosecutor. Tell him ex-Inspector Grandi has killed Giulio Sacchi. Any reference to persons living or dead is unintentional.
