"A GO player relives the real life on the board. Every move made is like a moment in life; you cannot undo your mistakes and they drag on you all along the game. The move is the present moment; you suffer, be happy, and struggle to survive or destroy your opponent. Future is the moves you contemplate." I feel strange… I knew that my opponent would take me down at my first mistake. DERSAADET APARTMENT Shall we move it? The scaffolding collapsed in a residence construction in the Çatladıkapı neighborhood. Two of the workers were left hanging on the scaffolding. Bystanders rushed to the area... ...to share the event on social media. The rescue effort is still underway. The groundbreaking works for the 4th bridge is to be commenced tomorrow. Many business people and MPs have attended... ...the grand opening ceremony held today. The public will decide on the name of the new bridge. In the Dargelirliler neighborhood, a 39-year-old man had a nervous breakdown and stabbed his 25-year-old wife and three children, 1, 3 and 6 years old. Then committed suicide. The wife and two of the infants died. And the one-year-old is in critical condition. What is it now? Drive on, man! Sons of bitches! Move on! You've been digging everywhere like restless moles, you fuckers! And they're digging around now? We are in this traffic jam because of you! You motherfucker… ISN'T GOD ENOUGH FOR BELIEVERS? IN CHANGE WE TRUST IF YOU GO DOWN YOU CAN'T GO UP -Hey, man! Shall I unload it? -Go ahead! -Who are you looking for? -Mr. Hamza, it's me, Altan. Mr. Altan! Welcome. For a moment I couldn't recognize you. It's such sad news. We're very sorry. -May God give you strength. -Thank you. My condolences. What an accident. Such a big truck… Yes. -May God give you patience. -Thank you. NEWS PHOTO OF THE YEAR 1974 HALUK DEVRIM (NO MORE GRIEF OF LOSING A CHILD...) (WE SHALL NOT LEFT FASCISM MURDER OUR CHILDREN...) (A WORLD WITH NO WAR AND NO EXPLOITATION) It coiled up in the corner like a spider waiting for his prey… Your honor, I use that street... ...to go to the construction site every morning. When I came to the street corner that morning, I didn't see the car. I was driving a dumper truck. It's difficult to maneuver around narrow streets. Is it true that you took the wrong way down a one-way street? Well, time is of the essence in our work, sir. And because all vehicles use that street both ways, I really didn't notice. Why would such a thing happen otherwise, sir? May God rest their souls. You have a long rap sheet. Right, sir. I've made some mistakes in the past. But I've turned a new page. I've gotten married, and I have a child, too, your honour! All right, understood. Mrs. Attorney? I concur with my client's statement, Your Honor. I request time from the court for us to present our defense in written form. Mr. Attorney? Your Honor, we'd like the accused to be imprisoned according to the relative law. It is decreed that considering the collected evidence and the scope of the case file, it has been decided that the detained defendant be discharged, and the sides given time until the next hearing to present their written statements. Altan, dear, what time did the accident happen? Morning. Early hours. Wasn't there anyone around to help? Was the ambulance late? -How did the accident happen? -The truck took the wrong way. It was a head-on collision, at daytime. On a side street. This case is a souvenir from your father. We were young. Smoking was trendy. But I've never smoked since then. Your father always used to talk about you. He was very proud of you. You made them very proud. "I've lived this moment long ago…" You exclaim in surprise. A staircase, a house you enter for the first time The window hit by the sunlight And a train whistle, right on time That's how these colors and sounds came together one afternoon when you were yet to be born Is life all about remembering? Perhaps not; maybe we too were Nothing but a sound for someone else In the surprising encounter years ago. -Mr. Altan? -Yes? Hello. I'm Seher Kavak. I'm the building supervisor. Hello. I'm very sorry about your loss. A terrible accident. But life goes on, right? These are for you. There's some news concerning the building. I don't want to take your time. I know you're still mourning. If you need anything, I live on the first floor. Apartment 2. -Thank you. -Sure. I have to sacrifice one of two stones. This puts me in a dilemma. The risk of an earthquake makes urban renewal necessary. We identified the risky buildings and zones. Now it's time to change. In change we trust. I'm Deren. This is Yeditepe. When we were kids, my mother would say when it rained... “Kids, look, it's raining abundance!” And we'd run out to the street, and draw in the lovely smell of the soil. These days, the rain can't reach the soil. The concrete doesn't let it. The rain gets sadder by the day. I get sadder by the day. Go outside, and don't leave this city alone. Treat it like your mother, daughter, brother, lover. May God accept your prayer, sir. Do you want water? My condolences. Come here, boy. May God accept your prayer, sir. CONSTRUCTION SITE ACCESS I don't know what to say, Altan. I wouldn't like to see you on such a sad occasion after so many years. I felt very strange when I came to your building this morning. That building was synonymous with your parents for me. I've missed you. I've missed you, too. I've been engrossed in the project for the last few years. Time flew by. I feel guilty, for not being with them. Sometimes we fall apart with our loved ones. And it's nobody's fault. Look at that. These things have possessed the city. Right. They're everywhere. You know how much we worked to get this velodrome built. I know. It hindered your studies at the college as well. Cyclists were so happy -But now they want to demolish it. -Why? To build a shopping center. Like there aren't enough of them around. Is there anything we can do? We've filed a law suit. Reports, hearings, environmental impact reports... We get a ruling in our favor, and they get on the offensive, and turn it around. They messed up the country. How long will you be here? I think I'll leave in a week or two. The legal process will take a long time. They'll wait for me. Don't worry, I can take care of it. -Just let me know if anything comes up. -Thank you. Wow, look at that bike! It's got a broken fork! Let me pass, kids. -Yes, Mr. Altan? -Hello, Mr. Hamza. Hello, Mr. Altan. I'll be leaving in a few days. I'd appreciate it if you could look after my mother's flowers. I'd also be grateful if you can get the apartment cleaned. Of course, Mr. Altan. Sukran and I will take care of the apartment. But… Didn't Ms. Seher tell you...? She stopped by and left some brochures, but… This place is changing. They say this building will be demolished as well. Some wealthy people come and ask about the building. By the way, the lock on the door is stuck. Please take care of it. Sure. Of course. Yes? Mr. Altan! -Is it the delivery boy? -No, it's not. Ms. Seher, I just saw the meeting notice. Has a decision been made about the building? Mr. Altan, didn't you look at the brochures I gave you? Our building is getting renewed! What do you mean, renewed? We reached an agreement with all the apartment owners. Your parents were the only ones who didn't agree. They were old people, after all. We couldn't explain to them how profitable this will be. Good thing you're here now. Where do you get the idea that I will agree? Mr. Altan, a brand new residence will be built in place of this rundown building. It'll be shiny, like the one right next to us. We have a deal with a contractor. Everyone will get two apartments for their land share. We've struck it rich! I do not agree to the Dersaadet Building being demolished! Mr. Altan, we spoke to everyone. They all signed. Why are you opposing this? I don't want a new apartment. This is my home, and I want it to remain so. A NEW LIFE BEGINS AT HASAR MILLENNIUM RESIDENCE The city has woken up. The new bridge is launching today. How many deer had died for the last bridge with no regard to the price to be paid? And who knows how many tortoises have died, will die, and keep dying for this one? Many weren't even born. Their trainer has never trained them. He just cleaned the fleas, ticks, and weed off them. He believed in saving them from humans, but failed. No human being could have thought of such a move. -Good morning. -Yes? I live in apartment 7. How long will your renovation take? -What did you say? I can't hear you. -How long will your renovation take? We're moving in, sir, can't you see? What's going on? Look, don't disturb us again! Close the door. Mr. Altan. It took them a lot of time for our file to be found. So the hearing will be around three o'clock. Hm. I see. When we say, “Let's pay a visit to that construction company” -none of the keyboard heroes are around! -Exactly. The construction machines are waiting next to the velodrome! -Time's running out! -Give me the address and I'll get you 150 people there in an hour. I've heard that before. You can't do that. Give me the address and be there in an hour! So, who do you think will get the yellow jersey? It will be Froom this year. Quintana is right along with him on the Peloton. They say he's ill. He's caught a virus. He's not a good climber. Hello, I was looking for Gürsel. He's at the back, working on a bike. -Gürsel! -Coming! Ah, Altan! Welcome. What a nice surprise. Gentlemen, Altan is my friend from school. He's like my brother. Now I remember him. Your father has passed away. Gürsel has told us. My condolences. He's a physicist. You've got to be a bit crazy for that, you know. Everyone's got a bit of a crazy side. Come in, I've got kefir. What country are you adding to the collection this year? I'm going to America in October... -There you go. Ice cold kefir. -Thanks. -What's this? -A nut cracker. A friend made it, a turner. Let me show you. -Wow! -There you go. Nice idea. So, what's up? Any news from the court? I've been at the courthouse all day. It took them hours to find the case file. -It's lunch time, so I came to see you. -Glad you did. I'm actually more upset about the apartment matter. What's going on? The building supervisor came by the other day. With some brochures and all that. I didn't get it at first. They've decided to get the building demolished and get a residence built in its place. They needed my parents to sign to go ahead and now they're still doing all they can despite their objection. Shame on them! So they're taking advantage of your parents' passing! Altan, there are specific laws for urban renewal. If they're determined, they'll find a way to do it. -What should I do? -We'll see. We'll find a way. Anyway, the boys are holding a criterium race at the Çakdurkan Velodrome next week. Come along. We'll watch it together We'll see. Start! Go, Büşra, go! Keep going! Congratulations. Congratulations. Bravo! Mr. Altan, they called me from Maraz construction company where the driver works. They're offering to pay us blood money. Do they think they can simply kill people and then cover it up? Not exactly. There are two reasons why they want to pay blood money. The first is that it will be an extenuating circumstance for the defendant. The second and most important reason is that they don't want us to file an indemnity lawsuit. Why don't we file it? Indemnity lawsuits usually don't bring significant compensation. And we'll have to keep following it for more than two years. If you ask me, let's accept the blood money. I don't like that term "blood money" at all. Wow, that's HUNK! What a delicious surprise. I know you have a soft spot for it. I'm sure you haven't eaten something like this in a while. You shouldn't have bothered. Thank you. It's actually Gürsel's specialty. I didn't do much, just the salad. We make it with gluten-free flour. It's good to eat healthy. We're getting older. What's with this tomato sauce? That's how Coraline likes it. This is how we make it now. Yes, we've done with the old tradition. Altan, I heard there's a problem about your apartment? Yes. The criminal case about my parents is going on. And now I have this new problem. It's upsetting. How many owners want the building demolished? To be honest, I don't know. But most seem more than willing. The supervisor says it's only my parents who didn't sign. Has a core sample been taken from the building? -I don't know. -Look, I'm in this business.- We can have the building tested if necessary. -Really, I can help you. -I know. Thank you. When we think cheap, we find ourselves in pits of hell. -Good morning, Mr. Altan. -Good morning. I'm Çetin Morduman, real estate contractor. Come in. -I hope I'm not disturbing you. -No, please. I hope you're doing fine. May God give you a long life. It's so unfortunate, but it's God's will, after all. I heard Ms. Seher Kavak talked to you, to explain the situation... She explained it, but I thought I should talk to you myself as well. If you're here to change my mind, don't waste your time. Mr. Altan, I know you're still mourning. And you have your memories, apparently. But life is going on, right? You have to keep up with the times. We're at your service for a safe future. This is true, believe me. You make us an offer too. Let's evacuate the building soon. And you'll have a safe apartment that complies with the new regulations. The Dersaadet Building is safe enough. It's steady as a rock. Mr. Altan, let's agree for a fifty-fifty deal for the two apartments you'll get in the new building. Okay? Or, you can pay me 500K liras for the other apartment as well. And have that one, too. We're here to serve you. I've rebuilt many buildings around here. And I'm not doing this for the money, you see. I won't change my mind. What is it you are after? Alright. Here's what we'll do, just to please everyone. I think you want the second apartment as well, which I find understandable. So just to please you, and let everyone get what they want... Here's my offer. 400K for the second apartment. Deal? Come on. My son is about this tall. I'm trying to ensure his good fortune. This is going to happen, whether you like it or not. Right? So long. Mr. Altan, your İstanbul-Nashville ticket has been made open-ended. -Anything else we can help you with? -No, thank you. Dear listeners, we need to unite to save the Çakdurkan Velodrome. The legal struggle has been going on for a year and the construction company is doing whatever it can to destroy our velodrome. In the face of all this injustice, we will not let Çakdurkan be destroyed. It belongs to us! Can we take a ride, man? Okay. But give me that first. Let me take that. Is this a midsummer night's dream, or is the heat making me sick? The thermometer is showing 40 degrees. The big old fat world is getting warmer, as we watch the rising concrete blocks.

Buildings designated to be under risk by the Ministry of Environment and Urbanization are to undergo zonal renewal. Areas and buildings under risk, reserved areas... New terms in our lives. They say urban renewal is necessary to avoid unlicensed and risky buildings. To keep ecological balance, and build a modern 21st century city. They say it's essential to save energy and improve quality of life. So say our statesmen. But there's a housing surplus of 700 thousand in the city! It must be for the ghosts! I don't remember the exact time, but they appeared all of a sudden. It was odd to see them amidst the chaos of the city. They were green, and beautiful. I saw them at the most unexpected times.

According to the new regulations, our building is designated as under risk. Under risk, is it? It's been in great shape for all these years, and now it's under risk… -We're moving out. -Where to? They arranged us a large, safe apartment at Ispartakule. We'll spend our days there with the entire family. So the landlord is evicting you. I wish you the best, Mr. Hamza. Let's hope so.
