There, you're free to go. Not without you. I'll be waiting for you. If I'm not there for the show tonight, they'll know. And they'll come after us. Now, you wait until the exact time, then come. You remember the place? You won't be missed until morning. It's a head start. And it's a big world out there. They'll never find us. STEP 1: PICK YOUR VICTIM STEP 2: STALK YOUR VICTIM Hey. Hey. How was your day? STEP 3: JUDGE YOUR VICTIM We, the daughters of virtue, gather once more to praise our heavenly father. But not before we dig into Janet's delicious oatmeal raisin cookies. Well, I confess, I am just here for the food. After the day I've had. I ran into Gurdy again. Can you believe the solo she did? It was like she was channeling Madonna, at Priest Noll. She was a daughter once. Gurdy? We weren't her cup of tea. Well, she's more of a soda pop person. Oh, that's her loss. This is rotten. I... beg your pardon? Alice, you should be more careful what you serve to your guests, we could have get sick. I pray you're more attentive to what you feed your family. Daughters, join hands. We thank you Lord, for everyone gathered here. That you know each of us by name. And you've called us to walk with you. We give praise. Thank you Lord, for my husband's raise at work, and Sam's good marks at school. Thank you Father, for giving my family strength. It's been a difficult year with the loss of our precious Megan. Watch over her. Thank you Father. You're an awesome God, I... Ronda? Honey, what is it? It's Luther. I think he's having an affair. Are you sure? I know it. He doesn't kiss me anymore. He doesn't touch me. Sometimes I can smell her on his shirt. - Are you okay? - Oh, it's nothing. I'm just clumsy at times. We're very sorry Ronda. Our ever-loving and righteous Lord, give Ronda strength to withstand the devil's assault on her marriage. Do not lead the good askew. But punish those who stray wrongfully, until they cry out in disgrace. Come here, sweet child. Cory. Baby. What is this? Where's my baby? Have a seat, Alice. Where's Cora? Please sit. Cora is safe. You needn't worry. I don't understand. What's going on? This is hard to say, Alice, but we're worried about you. You've been acting different lately. Hold up here, alone with the kids. While Walter's away on some business trip? I see a woman who's separated from him. Do you even confess your sins anymore? I do. I don't believe you. No-one here does. Why don't you confess now, Alice? That's a good idea. We fear the consequence of unconfessed sin. Will you bring Cora to me if I do? Please. Of course. I confess to you, Lord. I neglect my husband. I resent the times he leaves me here alone. I carry anger in my heart. Every day I'm left alone with these kids. To care for them on my own. And I never wanted them. I'm a terrible mother. I just wanted to please Walter. And be a good wife. I gave up everything. But they're all I have now. Alice what are you hiding? I hide... nothing. Bring me my child. I found that in Luther's pocket. Walter gave it to you last year. You were so proud. What do you have to say for yourself? I didn't mean to. You didn't mean to? The prayer of repentance. Read it. "Have mercy on me, God." In your abundant compassion. Blot out my offense. Wash away all my guilt. From my sin, cleanse me. For I know my offense. My sin is always before me. "I have done evil in your sight." It fell out of my hand. We must pray for her. In the name of Jesus, we pray that Alice, comes to know the truth, and be saved from destruction. We call upon you, please deliver Alice. In the name of Jesus, she shall honor and glorify you. Deliver Alice from the pit and corruption of her sin. Free her from the snare of the enemy. Get out... demon. What? I see you. It's monstrous eyes stare back at me. I tell you all, she is possessed. You're speaking nonsense, Betty. Daughters, take strength from the Lord and the power of His might. Hold her still. - Do it! - Betty, please don't! Please! In Jesus' name. Come forth and face God. Please don't do this to me. I can see it's tongue, slithering when you speak. We must save you, Alice. Sorry, Alice. Yes, Lord. We will strike it. We will strike it in your name. Ronda, your belt. Evil must reveal itself in order to face God's might. And to do so, it must be threatened. Do it, Ronda. God commands you. In His name. Do it! I can't. Thank you. I said out! Demon. Please. Stop. Repent! I'm sorry, for corrupting my marriage. For taking Ronda's husband. You ruined my life, Alice. Luther and I we've been together since junior-high. Why are you trying to take him from me? Why? You think you're prettier than I am? He used you but came home to me. And that bad feeling in the pit of your stomach? Those are the devil's eating away all the good in you. There's a cost for what you've done. But you weren't even good. What, Alice? Because I could. I needed something to pass the time. Stop it! Have you all lost your minds? You betrayed God with your actions. I cannot believe that I let you talk me into this. It was not supposed to go this far. You all need to get out of here. Get Cora, I will handle them. Cora? I'm calling the police. STEP 4: CHOOSE YOUR LOCATION I can't believe this hurts so much. I miss her so much. Let's play a game. Oh yeah, what kind of game? Well, you'll count to ten, and I'll hide, and if you can find me, I'll let you do whatever you want. I'm not playing this stupid game. Once you've earned, you have got to wait. I'll bury you, I swear to God. You're ridiculous. You like the way that feels? - You're good. - Yeah? Hey, don't do it too tight. - That's good. - Yeah? Yeah. One two go. One... Two three four four and a half... Sherri? Sherri? I know you're around here somewhere. Sherri? Sherri? Oh, that's good. You mother-fucker. What the fuck? Sherri? Sherri! Can I help you? Hey, Mr. Marks. Look, have you seen Sherri? Ah, we were just playing around down in the woods and I... What do you mean? Is she missing? Well I um... I found her phone and sweater and stuff it's just, it's it's not like her, to do this. No, it's not. What were you kids doing? Um, just playing hide and seek. Oh yeah? Sophie, why don't you go grab Jake some water? I bet he's thirsty from all that horsing around. My little angel. Just like her mom. I think Sherri is just upset about tomorrow. It's the anniversary. You know how it is. I'm sorry I haven't seen her. I'll keep my eye out for sure. Have you checked by the river? Yeah it's actually where I found her phone. You don't think we should call the police? - No, no, it's okay. - Well, it's no bother I... That's fine, I'm sure she'll turn up. Well yeah... hopefully. Thanks, Sophie. Why don't we get out of here? It's getting dark. Thanks again, Tim. Sorry to bother you. It's no bother. Sherri, come on! Oh, fuck! [eerie drum roll. Sherri... No, Sherri, no. No. Howdy, Cowboy. You know, I'd really like to help you. But I think you're trespassing, and I'd like you to leave. What did you say? You don't see the sign? You don't see the sign? Help. Somebody help. Where is she? Where is who? Sophie... Boo! Sophie, where's your mom? Is she okay? Sophie, listen to me, where's your mom at? Mama's not coming anymore today. She was in a bad, bad accident. She can't come get us. What are you talking about? Wanna play a game? No, no, Sophie, look at me. I need help. Let's play hide and seek! No Soph! Listen to me. Please help me! Count to 50 Jakey. Sophie! One, two, three, four, Boo! You weren't counting! Yeah, I was Sophie... I'm counting. Pop pop was right about you. What? What do you mean? Mama said you're going to die today. Morning sunshine. What's going on? You tell me. Fucking let me go! Jeez! Where's Chery? What did you do to her? You wanna see her? You wanna see your sweet Chery? Hey baby. Yeah Timothy. What the fuck is going on? Look at that devil. This is your big scene. I... I don't understand, what? I'm sorry. Why... Please I wanted to get you back. To get you back... Mumbling... For mom! For the car accident! My beautiful wife would still be here right now, if it wasn't for you. It was an accident! I ran over a line... no... You were driving the car, it's your fault. I'm tired from the train.
