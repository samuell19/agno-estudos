DREAMLAND My grandfather was born in 1919, at Oddsstaðir in Melrakkaslétta. He may have belonged to the last generation in Iceland Living in full harmony with reality. People of his generation ... (ANDRI SNÆR MAGNASON Writer) Considered themselves rich because they were not hungry. Thirty people lived on the farm, knowing exactly their source of survival. The salmon became his sister ... Driftwood produced the warmth inside the house and the house itself. The eiderdown produced the warmth under the covers. They knew what they lived on and what they had to do to survive. Then his brother took over. Tractors had arrived and suddenly ... You could produce 10-100 times more food than ever before. And everybody just left ... Reality had increased by 100% but all the people had moved away. (DR. HULDA ÞÓRISDÓTTIR Professor of Psychology) Fear is a very powerful emotion. It is perhaps the only one that the brain senses unconsciously It travels shorter distances in the brain than other emotions. Sometimes, we are not really aware of being afraid. Fear is marked by a great sense of uncertainty and lack of control. It is extremely unpleasant and we long "to make things better". We want clear-cut solutions, not something that "might work" We don't want something that has never been tried before. People who are afraid tend to be less tolerant towards others. In large groups, they dislike people with different opinions. Sir, I repeat: This action will provide 2000-2500 new jobs! Unless people realize that they are being manipulated ... Fear is a highly effective way of controlling them. It is unjustifiable to repeat time and time again: "We can do something else". If the MP has different solutions, I urge him to step up and tell us which solutions he has in mind. In Iceland, it is perhaps fear of unemployment, bad economy ... Something that might threaten our independence as a nation. There is a need for continued economic growth in Iceland It's clear that if we don't use the country's energy resources There will be a considerable downturn in economic growth With an attendant rise in unemployment. ... We need economic growth ... ... What if the cod disappears ...? ... What if the banks go bankrupt? ... The people need work ... ... You can't be opposed to everything ... (KATRÍN ÓLAFSDÓTTIR Economist Economic) growth isn't necessarily a good thing. If economic growth rises too high, We start producing beyond our national product, inflation rates start to rise, current-account deficits grow Unemployment rates go down but what we are left with ... ls an imbalance that we'll have to deal with sooner or later. To measure economic growth is a bit like measuring feelings. Imagine the Union of Psychologists issuing the following statement: "More feelings detected in October than in July" Without distinguishing between different feelings like love and hate. They'd simply say: "We have more feelings" or "We need more feelings". If world peace would suddenly spread out, like a virus ... The headlines around the world would be: "Denmark declares to foreign nations that it recognizes Iceland as a sovereign state". "Iceland affirms its permanent neutrality and that it will have no flag of war". "The treaty takes effect on Dec 1 st, 1918". (VALUR INGIMUNDARSON Historian) When the USA put forward a request for military bases in Iceland The US ambassador, Dreyfuss, was very determined: He wanted four US bases in Iceland for the next 99 years, situated in ... (MATTHÍAS JÓHANNESSEN Poet and former editor of Morgunblaðið) They didn't stand a chance against the Prime Minister. As a political leader, he'd fought for Iceland's independence He didn't want to turn Iceland into an American colony. Business trade with the Base became so big between 1951 -55 ... It almost became an export trade on its own. 18-20 % of our foreign exchange derived from this business trade. The following years, the economy was sustained with funds and loans. Iceland was considered so small ... That when Iceland started doing big business with the USSR in 1953, -In the middle of the Cold War - Eisenhower proposed at a meeting of the National Security: "Why don't we just buy up all of Iceland's fishing production ..." "To solve this problem once and for all?" if the army leaves, everything goes straight to hell! Prime Minister Davíð Oddsson met with George Bush In the White House today to discussed Iceland's defense. The meeting went well but it has taken a long time to establish it. What does this really mean? -The Base will cut down on staff But it will continue to operate, I am pretty sure about that. It's absurd to think you can make friends with a superpower. There is no such thing as friendship with a superpower. Only interests. To maintain anything else is simply absurd. We don't want Iceland in NATO! We want the army to go home! Iceland has become a nation without armed forces. Icelandic authorities have taken over the US army base. The police saluted the head of the US base outside his office. A short farewell ceremony took place at the airport. Americans and Icelanders said goodbye for the last time. They disappeared into the sunset on a DC-9 jet. We have an international university campus ... Where there used to be a military base for NATO! In my mind, that's not a bad way to end the military occupation. A new aluminum plant will soon be built here in Helguvík. While signing the contracts today, it was stressed how important a role This plant would play in increasing jobs in the Suðurnes area. There seems to be enough energy in the Hengill area for this project. Research will continue, drilling will continue. There was an over-production of electricity in Iceland in 1995. A mountain of excessive butter, meat and ... Electricity. To put this electricity into use, "Lowest Energy Prices" was written. -75 MW ... 150 MW ... 80-100 MW ... A total of 150 MW ... 255 MW ...70 and up to 200 MW ... A 90 MW power plant ... A 750 MW hydroelectric plant ... A total of 760 gigawatts a year! All the homes, plus companies and small industry = less than 3 TWh/y. The pamphlet, however, promises 30 TWh/y for the big corporations. In the pamphlet and in all official records, this is what they call: "Profitable hydro power that doesn't harm the environment" At first, there were ongoing negotiations with Union Carbide From Union Carbide's chemical accident in 1984 in Bhopal, India. A very big American company that later got into big trouble in India. (GARÐAR INGVARSSON former director of MÍL Market Bureau) Rio Tinto Zinc was ready for a silicon smelter plant in Iceland They hadn't built one before and negotiations were well underway. There's hardly an aluminum company that hasn't visited Iceland at some point. Iceland had all these opportunities, it had built up a solid infrastructure When they decide to make Iceland the world's biggest aluminum manufacturer. Alcan, Arctus and Norsk Hydro are currently trying to find a place For their aluminum plants on the South-West coast of Iceland. ... Trying to establish power- intensive industry in Þorlákshöfn ... ... People of Vogar are voting about a future Alcan power plant in Keilisnes ... ... There are currently new ideas of a more extensive landfill ... ... The plan is to start building three aluminum plants next year ... In Þorlákshöfn, Helguvík and Bakki. Alcoa announces that it will go ahead with a new power plant in Iceland ... ... And speaking of aluminum plants ... -One in Brimnes, Skagafjörður ... Another one in Dysnes, Eyjafjörður ... ... And one in Bakki, Húsavík. If all ideas of aluminum plants will be realized, annual production ... Will increase almost four times and become more than 2,5 million tons. That's what I call development policy for the countryside! (JOHN PERKINS, author of "Confessions of An Economic Hit-Man") Research and drillings for a future hydro power project ... Have started near Skaftá river. -Today, Landsvirkjun published ... An environmental assessment for a dam in Norðlingaalda. In Villinganes, all permits are ready for a power-intensive industry ... Except for a development permit, says Minister of industry. The resources will be used to drive power-intensive industry in the North. The Kárahnjúkar Dam and the harnessing of Jökulsá ... Will have the most drastic impact on the environment ... At the same time, they are the most profitable options. If all the power-intensive industry in the South-East will be realized ... There will be enough power for two server farms, two silicon plants ... The first installation of an aluminum plant in Helguvík ... And a production increase of the aluminum plant in Straumsvík. (REYNIR HARÐARSON, founder and artistic director of CCP) A company like Landsvirkjun specializes in making plants and ... It's quite understandable that their engineers want to continue to do so Because this is their life's work. It's like a self-feeding machine. It won't stop unless we make it stop. First and foremost, I look where I can get energy for a good price (FRIÐRIK SOPHUSSON Managing director of Landsvirkjun) And how it is possible to sell it at an even better price. And if it is to Suðurnes, I'm happy. But I can't rule out other places. Our sales territory, if I may say so, is all of Iceland. (JAKOB BJÖRNSSON, former director general of the National Energy Authority) For ages, or let's say as late as the 16th century Icelanders have had pretty strange ideas about the highlands, as we know. In their minds, it became the home of ghosts, trolls, outlaws, elf-queens - All kinds of supernatural and hostile creatures. There are accounts ... Of farmers who went to the highlands armed with weapons, just in case. Such a thing must be unheard of in our history of collecting sheep. Me and many people of my generation realized that this was all hogwash. The highlands were not a ghost world, just plain landscape like anywhere else. You can find volcanoes and lava in Kamchatka as well as in Iceland; You can also find high plateaus in Altiplano, S-America, or Mongolia; Water springs in relatively unspoilt environment exist in Yellow Stone; Glacier tongues and glaciofluvial drift exists in Alaska and Svalbard; (ÞÓRA ELLEN ÞÓRHALLSDÓTTIR Biologist) But nowhere on earth, except in Iceland, can you see all these things ... In a three-day trip. Some say Iceland is the most beautiful country in the world. Every country could say the same thing, of course. All countries can't be the most beautiful country in the world. Exaggerations are perhaps more common in Iceland than elsewhere. Halldór Laxness Nobel prize author Naturalists from all over the world have begged ... The government, the parliament and finally the people of Iceland To spare Þjórsárver from destruction. At an international gathering of conservationists in London Only one person spoke as an adversary of Iceland He was sent there by the National Energy Authority in Reykjavík. In his speech, he stressed that Icelanders were most certainly Not prepared to abandon their operations at Þjórsárver. Þjórsárver is a vegetation oasis in more than one sense, I think. An oasis in the desert. The area is bounded by Hofsjökull glacier in the North and ... Surrounded by wastelands from the East, the West and the South. This oasis exists because of all the water that flows through the area Both below and above the surface. In this isolated oasis, almost at the center of Iceland, There is a staggering amount of animal and plant species, Probably the largest selection in the entire Icelandic highlands. If you look at the wildlife, this is indeed a unique place in the world. It is on a list of wetlands of international importance. The expansion of the power plant in Grundartangi has not been secured. An energy resource is needed to fulfill the needs of a bigger plant. Pre-research shows that an expansion would prove cost-effective. ... This would mean a go-ahead with the expansion of the plant ... ... The expansion of the Norðurál plant could start this summer ... Demonstrations against bauxite- production in Orissa, India. When a company like Alcoa moves its power plants From the Third World to Iceland, -where salaries are way higher - Starts shipping bauxite from Jamaica to Iceland ... There must be catch. Otherwise, they wouldn't make this kind of decisions. ... We must realize that we're talking about a global influence ...! It's fair to say that lodging power-intensive industry means ... That we have certain moral obligations towards the world. I have also said many times that I think it is simply ridiculous That aluminum industry in Iceland is included in the Kyoto Protocol. If we would exploit each and every important natural resource in Iceland We could make nearly as much aluminum as America dumps Into the garbage each year, without recycling. The exercise follows a scenario in which ultra-environmentalists Come to Iceland and threaten national security. The exercise takes place in Helguvík, among other places. This week, dozens of soldiers have either been in hiding or ... Fighting an imaginary attack against the environmentalists. Is it possible to put a price on everything? Let's say we could process the gold in the Mount Esja. How much money would we accept for selling Mount Esja? Would that be 2 billion kronas? 20? When traveling around the country or seeing pictures of the landscape One thinks: "Even if I have nothing, I'd still have this". This is ours ... But now, the message is: "No, this is not yours". The route from Landmannalaugar to Þórsmörk ... Is it a national park? I don't even think it is protected. Otherwise, these plans wouldn't exist Of making it the subject of massive energy utilization. Currently, the emphasis is on exploiting the geothermal areas. In many ways, they march into these areas like gold diggers Even though a proper study of the ecosystem hasn't been done. (JÓN ÓLAFSSON Geologist) There aren't many geothermal areas in Iceland, around twenty. Many of these geothermal areas have already been disturbed Most of the remaining ones will probably be disturbed in the next years. Research drilling causes great damage. Afterwards, many people think: "Further disturbance in the area is all right -the damage is already done" This is how they have their way. My name is Sæþór Gunnsteinsson, from Presthvammur in Aðaldalur. I've lived here all my life. Of course this place means a lot to me. Sheep have grazed these pastures since ... People started living here. I've been looking after sheep in this area since I was a kid. I've been the leader of the round-ups for 10 years. I've been going to the round-ups for 25 years. I care deeply for this land. The landscape is magnificent ... You can see all kinds of different landscape over here: Huge walls of rocks like in Þingvellir that runs for miles in this area. It's something special to be here when it's bright all night long Especially in calm weather, with the sun setting in the west And steams of water rising up from every pore in the ground. (SÆÞÓR GUNNSTEINSSON Farmer at Presthvammur) I'll keep this picture in my mind, even though I may never see it again. People come from all over ... To see the geothermal area and this magnificent landscape. People can make a living here without destroying the nature. Who knows what the wilderness will be worth in years to come? Oddly enough, there's no discussion. As soon as the research permit is in, the ball starts rolling. Everybody just sits and waits for the aluminum money to cash in. Although geothermal areas are relatively common in Iceland It is quite a rare phenomenon compared to the world at large. Iceland has a moral duty to take care of these natural resources. We must protect them, not only for the benefit of ourselves, But for the benefit of every nation on this planet. A fair discussion about ... A high-tech aluminum plant and urban life living side by side ls not a matter of air pollution but rather a question of outlook Towards residents and bypassers. This is the matter in a nutshell. Choose a bigger and a better plant. -Alcan in Straumsvík. The Ministry of industry has commissioned Finnur Ingólfsson -the head of the Central Bank and a former Minister of industry - To lead a committee to get more aluminum companies to Reyðarfjörður. Guests keep coming to Fljótsdalur, where prosperous people live. (ALAIN BELDA, CEO of Alcoa arrives in Egilsstaðir Airport on March 15th, 2003.) They show their hospitality to these wanderers who come in crowds. A crowd of wanderers, loads of women -these people are up to no good. And here comes Grýla, greedy like an eagle; And here comes Grýla, she only has appetite for children. You're wearing an Alcoa cap, T-shirt and the whole gamut! Does this day call for a celebration? -Sure does, as somebody said ... This could be the national day of Reyðarfjörður. (GUÐBERGUR BERGSSON Writer.) Well, Iceland has been a colony almost from the start. First it was a Norwegian colony, then a Danish one and later ... An American colony. Now, it's a colony for ... American industry. Senior citizens raise the flags of Alcoa, Eskifjörður and Fjarðarbyggð. One of Alcoa's executives visited us last fall with an interpreter. I seized a long-awaited opportunity and asked for a flag. Since we, the senior citizens, can't afford to buy much. He took favorably to my request and the flag arrived a month later. The package was from Australia, so it must have been from there. The signing of the contract to build an aluminum plant in Reyðarfjörður March 15th, 2003 Without further ado, I'd like to introduce the people on the stage, Valgerður Sverrisdóttir, Minister of industry and Finance! Alain Belda, President and Chief Executive Officer of Alcoa! Geir Haarde Former Prime Minister Is it the sea or the mountains that draws me to this place? Or is it the aluminum plant that soon will be built over here? We receive positive news about products ... Connected with these companies, ads in the papers of how they work. This information is carefully picked for us. We are not told that ... Alcoa is a leading participant of manufacturing weapons in the States. Preparation for Kárahnjúkar dam continues despite the fact that ... The Director of the National Planning Agency has already rejected the dam Due to the unacceptable impact that it will cause on the environment. The plant will produce 240.000, 360.000 and then 480.000 tons. They bigger they get, the more profit they make! As members of government, we will guarantee ... ... That those institutions evaluating environmental effects Will turn in their results on time. Before the eyes of Our Lord on this beautiful day of summer We present the biggest construction project in the history of Iceland In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost we all say amen. Minister for the Environment reversed a decree by the Planning Agency The Agency had previously rejected the Kárahnjúkar Dam The Planning Agency could have done a better job, in our opinion. Also, there was a lot of pressure coming from Landsvirkjun. They wanted the report published to continue with the project. Politicians have hopes and dreams but it's a privilege to see them come true. A mighty power has been unleashed, and it's all happening right here. Isn't it like a dream coming true? A meeting was held today, what did you discuss? -We found out that ... Four individuals were very outspoken and tried to influence the others. So we have decided to send these four individuals home tonight. My name is Örn Þorleifsson and I live here in Húsey. This island is created by the load from Jökla river. (ÖRN ÞORLEIFSSON Farmer in Húsey) A special wildlife had developed here with 175 types of plants And 30 different bird species have laid their eggs here. The building of the Kárahnjúkar dam changed a lot around here. The birds, for example the loon, didn't lay eggs here this spring. The river carried a lot of moraine that stuck to the sandbanks. This has created problems for men and animals since the construction began. It blocks the view so you can't really see the farmsteads nearby. This spring we had trouble breathing because of this. Even the airplanes flying over Egilsstaðir complain about this. The landscape changes constantly, regardless of human beings. This is a different country from the one the Vikings discovered. The land has changed, the natural forces have changed it. I don't see why man can't change it as well, if he wants to. I can't see anything wrong with that. (HEIÐAR MÁR GUÐJÓNSSON Economist) These big constructions had a huge impact on the economy. The National Bank predicted that both the dam and the plant Would cause such money-flow in the system between 2003-2007 That they would have to increase the interest rates To make room for these construction. In other words ... Companies are "cooled" or "tied down" a bit ... So that the State can take a bigger slice of the domestic product. Is that a positive thing? No, that's very negative. Residents of Yarloop, south of Perth in West Australia, have started ... A campaign against the pollution coming from an Alcoa plant. They complain over itching, respiratory irritation, nosebleeds Chronic fatigue syndrome, mental illness and cancer. Alcoa, the biggest manufacturer of alumina, is also accused ... Of charging excessively for alumina. Alcoa ... Parent company of Alcoa-Fjarðarál in Reyðarfjörður, has been accused ... Of bribing employers in Barein to make negotiations go smoother. James I. Gadsden The American ambassador US authorities investigate Alcoa after Aluminum Barein filed a suit Against Alcoa for bribing anonymous employers in Barein. The President of Alcoa, Alain Belda, is also under a lot of pressure. He received $25 million last year in salaries and benefits Which is twice the amount he received the year before. Alcoa, parent company of Alcoa-Fjarðarál in Reyðarfjörður, Has considered building a new aluminum plant in Bakki, Húsavík. Two aluminum plants in your constituency? -Yes. (VALGERÐUR SVERRISDÓTTIR Former Minister of industry) Is that your goal? -Yes, I also want an aluminum plant in Húsavík. A multi-functional sports hall may be built in Reyðarfjörður. Alcoa and Bechtel plan to take part in this project. These enormous constructions will surely benefit our economy Bring us great prosperity in the near future. Here is Guðmundur Bjarnason, Mayor of Fjarðarbyggð! I was Mayor when negotiations about an aluminum plant started. (GUÐMUNDUR BJARNASON Former Mayor of Fjarðarbyggð) First we talked with Norsk Hydro, then Alcoa. There is a turning point in the life of Mr. Bjarnason. He retires after 15 years in office. Helga Jónsdóttir is the new Mayor. I am a project manager for Alcoa. My job mainly concerns cooperation with the public administration, Local authorities and larger companies. -It's a golden opportunity for us ... (TRYGGVI FINNSSON Regional business agent in Húsavík) To be able to ask people with everything still in fresh memory: What did you do right? What could you have done better? Bjarnason is our main contact man, he's given us valuable comments. For example, how to go about ... While negotiating with Alcoa! (ÓMAR RAGNARSSON Reporter) It becomes easy to convince people, for example in Húsavík, It isn't because they're not equal to us as human beings in any way The town simply doesn't stand a chance against this kind of power. If even the president of the USA has to show his respect to Alcoa ... How do you think a small town in Iceland can stand a chance? No, no, no. The district communities have nothing to fear. There was a lot of good will during the negotiations, you could feel it. The district communities are so small, after all. And I have got news for you ... What is the response from Húsavík ...? An aluminum plant is really the greatest gift we could have received. This is probably the greatest moment in the history of our community since ... Viking Garðar Svavarsson set foot in Húsavík and settlement began. Héðinshöfði is the first farmstead in Tjörnes, north of Húsavík. It's always been a large estate and a very good estate Poet Einar Benediktsson lived here. I grew up in his house ... - In his room, in fact. I slept there until I reached adolescence. I am of the third generation, the fourth generation exists. It might take over, someday. (JÓNAS JÓNASSON Farmer at Héðinshöfði) I first heard of the plant when we were summoned to a meeting We were told that if an aluminum plant would be built, The location of the future Alcoa plant It would be impossible to continue farming on this land. It was also implied that all the inhabited areas would perish. All the good cropland becomes ... A dilution zone. If they put a plant here, the estate is ruined and they'll drive us away. When my old man heard about this, he said he'd take the old Land Rover ... And drive it over the hill, rather than live to see this. Near the deserted farm of Bakki, just north of Húsavík, Specialists are researching the strata for a future power plant. Supporters of the plant are also here to show their support. People have gathered to prove to themselves and the nation as well that they support this project and that the entire nation isn't against it. But are the locals just pawns in the game of big corporations? Suddenly, people are fighting over real estates in Húsavík the young people are coming back and this is our way to show them that we support them and that we want to create a future for them. When the supporters of the plant intended to put a bouquet of flowers on Einar Benediktsson's memorial, three young men protested. Surely, Benediktsson was ahead of his times and wanted ... To harness the natural resources and sell the energy to foreigners. If he were alive today ... I think he'd still be ahead of his times and be an environmentalist. That's my belief. The aluminum plant in Húsavík is supposed to be generated ... Purely with geothermal energy. It is possible to do that ... With the first installment which produces ca. 200.000 tons. After that, this resource will be all used up. All these plants have to expand -that's just how it works - So for the expansion, they'll have to exploit Skjálfandi river. Aldreyjarfoss Waterfalls in Skjálfandi River if we take the first step ... We'll soon be on a roller-coaster and we won't be able to stop. If we don't stop this now, nobody will stop ten years from now. There will be no progress in this country if politicians continue to discourage people. To tell people that things are out of control, To tell entrepreneurs to be on their guard. Progress doesn't happen automatically. To stop means to take a step backwards ... To stop means delaying progress. Fear of change will get us nowhere. Since an agreement was reached ... To built the Kárahnjúkar dam and a power plant in Reyðarfjörður the Middle East part of Iceland has blossomed like a flower in summer. We're building nearly 200 houses, Real estates in Fjarðarbyggð have increased by 50-60% in one year. Great opportunities lie ahead. The biggest enterprise in Icelandic history made all this possible. Every time the state comes up with a project on such a huge scale They are brushing other opportunities aside. As a result, it is more difficult to build up new companies. The economy might take a dive once these big projects are completed. If another big project is needed to save the economy, well ... That's a bit like staying drunk to avoid the hangovers. The consequences of prolonging such a mentality will be horrible. When a politician has decided that the future of the nation, -the future of its education, of the health care system etc. - Depends on one single project, - What happens when a biologist ... Voices some uncomfortable ideas? -The National Energy Authority ... Has allowed one of its geophysicist to speak out about Kárahnjúkar. Because of the serious nature of his comments a question arises: Why wasn't it reported to Parliament and the industrial Committee? The Director of NEA had the memo labelled confidential. Obviously, somebody wanted to keep these information secret because ... It threatened national interests. I just find it very strange ... To build such a big dam over an active fault zone and earth fractures. What happens when a photographer shows beautiful pictures of the area? This needs to be hushed down too ... "The Land that Will Disappear" Photos by RAX (RAGNAR AXELSSON (RAX) Photographer) It was a surprise ... Showing these pictures in this small community ... The atmosphere was really strange ... It was so ruthless ... People threatened me, assaulted me ... People called me up and asked: Why are you showing people these bloody pictures? Yesterday, they weren't aware that this landscape existed! Then they just turn up the volume on all the other stuff ... Today, Bechtel received an award from the Ministry for the Environment For outstanding contributions to the environment last year. Today, the króna rose by 1,2% ... Experts at the Icelandic Bank say the cause of this is probably due to ... High expectations of a future Alcoa power plant in North. In the end, the overall picture must be off balance. If it all adds up, it would be a stroke of pure luck. Series of waterfalls in Jökulsá River Perished on Sept. 11th, 2008 Most likely, however, a crack runs down the entire process ... Through the preliminary researches and down to the heart of the matter. I don't think it is really fair ... When people who have never been here and seen the area ... Start to care about this area. -This argument makes no sense. Few people have been face-to-face with the Mona Lisa at the Louvre. It doesn't mean that we don't care if someone ruins it. It's enough for us to know that these things exists. Whether or not you've been there or not doesn't count. Did you go to Töfrafoss Falls? -I went all over the place and ... I don't really regret that this land is going under water, to be frank. This area is not something you'd think of as a particularly beautiful. Surely a large area is going under water but it's not that beautiful ... At least not when it is compared to other places in Iceland. It is repeatedly stated that if you are against these constructions ... You are only supporting the protection of a deserted wasteland. Let's look at the facts: 40 km of vegetated area will be drowned. The jewel in the crown is Háls. It consists of 15 km of soil, A fertile soil that is 2-3m thick and lies 600m above sea level. This is what they're sinking, they're always sinking vegetation! Never in our history has a construction brought equal destruction of vegetation. The last man-made reservoir, Blöndulón, holds second place! Time and time again, we're sinking areas rich in vegetation! Mountains are the home of gods. (ERLA STEFÁNSDÓTTIR Piano teacher) I think they'll rise up to defend themselves, if they are attacked. People know this, it's just not cool to speak about it these days. You're not supposed to have feelings, just stay cool, act like you don't care. What kind of person are you ... if you have no feelings for your country? The mountains? The rivers? Last Tuesday, around 12.000 people joined Ragnarsson in a protest walk. Ragnarsson proposes that the dam will stand ready but unused As a monument to the courage of a nation that sought reconciliation With future generations and its own conscience. The filling of Hálslón reservoir started this morning. It is estimated that it will take a year to fill the reservoir. According to the leading engineer of Kárahnjúkar dam ... They've done everything in their power to secure the dam. June 9th, 2007 At the site of Hálslón reservoir The surface of Hálslón reservoir has risen rapidly during the last 24-h. The water spreads steadily over the area around Kárahnjúkar dam. June 9th, 2007. Alcoa's opening ceremony in Reyðarfjörður. Honored guests, dear friends, I congratulate you on this day Alcoa-Fjarðarál Power Plant and the people that work here Receive our blessings, in Jesus' name: Amen. What do we want to do? What does the future hold? What does the future hold for our children? The way I see it, Iceland is at a crossroads right now. We have a chance of a lifetime to create our own future A chance few other nations have to do something really great. What are we going to do? Walk away from it?
