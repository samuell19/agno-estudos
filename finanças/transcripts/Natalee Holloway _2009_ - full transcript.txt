You know what it's like there, Patrick. These girls, man, they come down from the States when they're done with school. They're ready to cut loose, man, ready to party. So, this girl, Natalee? She was just this girl hanging out with her friends. I wasn't really into her that much, but she wanted a drink, and I'm like, "Why not?" You know? Yeah. Then the place closed, and she asked me for a ride. So you gave her a ride. It was the gentleman thing to do. Okay, so far, we have 132 students signed up for the trip and seven chaperones, including myself. Now, notice I didn't say "babysitters". Now, we won't be doing head counts or bed checks. We're there for emergencies and to do a little gambling in the casinos. Which reminds me, if you don't want your child to lose all of his or her college money, don't send them with a whole lot of cash or ATM cards. The legal gambling age is 18, and so is the drinking age. I was hoping your father would chip in on this. He says it's too extravagant. Honestly, Natalee, you did us both a favour by getting that scholarship. We don't have to put in a cent for tuition. He could spare a dollar or two. Mom, he's gonna give me $500 as a graduation present. So, Natalee's going, right? Yeah, because I told her, if it's a money thing, maybe I could ask my dad if he could, you know, help out. If anyone deserves to go on this trip, it's Natalee. She's going. If I have to move heaven and earth, she's going. Aruba! - How's it fit? - It fits. - Well, come out and let me see it. - Why are you in such a hurry? I told you, I have a meeting with one of my students' parents. Aren't teachers supposed to have Saturdays off? Well, kids with special needs usually have parents with special schedules. What do you think of this for the Kappa Delta tea? You look like a dish of ice cream. - For Aruba? - You already have two bathing suits. You're only gonna be there three and a half days. But I'm gonna be swimming all the time. You do not need that. Mom. Imagine having to put on a wet bathing suit full of sand. Imagine the chafing. Go on, try it on. I don't know why you decided to be a doctor. Being a lawyer is obviously your calling. Hey, honey. Did you grab the mail? No, I did not. Don't see any need to hurry and count my bills. - Matt, can you grab the mail? - Okay, Mom. Hey, Jug, like my dress? She went shopping today. Thanks, honey. For rush week, sorority teas. You trying to impress the girls with that dress or turn the heads of the boys? The girls are much harder to impress, believe me. I have to e-mail a picture of this dress to Hayley. You know what her daddy would say about a dress that short. Well, what he doesn't know won't hurt him. Thanks, Jug. Seems like the smaller the dress, the bigger the price tag. Well, if that's what it takes to get into a good sorority, then that's what it takes. - You're way late. - It's not my fault. My dad took me out to lunch and sapped on me. "My little girl's going off to college. I'm gonna be left all alone, poor me." Did you tell him his little girl's going to prom tonight with Daniel Slocum? No. He would lock me in my room and sit on the front porch with his shotgun. - Sounds like my dad. - Your dad's a whole state over. At least I don't tell him big fat lies about who's taking me to prom. At least I don't let my mom set me up with someone I don't even like. I like Troy fine. He'll dance with me. Daniel won't dance. Might mess up his hair. He has got the most gorgeous curly hair. It is like art. I'm so bummed he's not going to Aruba. I'm sure there'll be plenty of guys there with good hair. Like you'd notice, Little Miss Picky Pants. Hey, just 'cause I'm not a slut like you... I am not a slut. You are so... - I know we've already had the boy talk. - About five times. - Well, let's just have it one more time. - I don't need a boy talk for Troy. Honey, boys suddenly can look very different on the dance floor, especially after you've had a drink or two. - We're not gonna be drinking, Mom. - Really? Well, things have really changed since I went to prom. We don't have to drink tonight. We'll be in Aruba next week. We can drink there. Prom, Aruba, same thing. You have to be careful around boys and alcohol. They're liable to take advantage. I know, Mom. I know, okay? And I promise you, I'm always careful. Okay? I know. Look at you. You look so beautiful. I wish I had a real date. I wish I could find someone I actually liked. You have all the time in the world for that. - Hey, come on, guys. - We're coming. We're coming. - Make way for the graduate. - I got to go. I'm taking your car. Promise me you won't be late. Just one picture. Come on, photo op. Get next to your sister, Matt. All right, get a little closer. Come on. Squeeze in. Scoot over, Matt. - Matt, you just stepped on my foot. - Sorry. - Big smiles. - One, two, three. Mom! Why are you still asleep? You said you'd get up at 4:00! - I'm getting up right now. - Come on, we're gonna be late. Honey, I promise you, Hayley's mom won't leave for the airport without you. Did you remember to put your sunscreen in a plastic bag so it doesn't spill all over your stuff? - It's not gonna spill. - I hope not. I'd hate to see all your nice new clothes get ruined. Mom, it's not gonna spill. - Everything's gonna be fine. - I hope you have the best, best time. I will. And you have fun at the lake. - I love you, Mom. - And I love you, baby. Hi, Nat. Come on in. - Oh, my gosh. - I am loving Aruba already. - Cheers? - Cheers. This is my bed. Who's sleeping with me? Me! Look how close the pool is. I dare you. They're crazy. Body shot! You so have to take a body shot off me. Stop. - Knock it off! - Stuck-up bitch. - Leave her alone. - Hey, take it easy. - Okay, okay. - Back off! Oh, my God. We just started a bar fight. Here's to good friends, and here's to Maggie's mom for letting us use the house. Yeah. This is the best vacation I've had in a really long time. And here's to our kids getting old enough to take their own vacation. Amen. No, I'm just really surprised, because I thought for sure that you were gonna be crawled up in a big old ball of empty-nest syndrome when Natalee went off to college. I still have Matt, and I love my little girl, but she is work. I am looking forward to a nice, quiet nest for a while. You are so faking it. You hush up and have some more wine. Well, I'm not faking it. I got two out the door, three more to go. So here's to the empty nest. - Hey, guys. - Hey. I thought you were going snorkelling again today. Yeah, we tried, but we had to get off the boat. She's got herself a hangover. Isn't she cute? Our little Natty's growing up. I'm never drinking again, ever. Are you kidding me? You're going to U of A. Huge party school. - And you are drinking tonight. - No, I'm not. Yes, you are. It's our last night. Come on, the best cure for a hangover is another drink. It's not even noon yet. What's that saying, "What happens in Aruba stays in Aruba"? It's Vegas, stupid. Well, it should be Aruba. Come on, Nat. Last chance before you have to start reading 30 pages a night and dissecting goats and whatever else you pre-med people have to do. - Come on. - Yeah. Cheers, Nat. Okay, come help me with this. Yes! I am not doomed! Right. Let's go again. What are you doing? Aren't we going to Carlos'n Charlie's? Yeah, in a minute. This guy is just helping me win back the money I lost last night. What'd you say your name was again? - Joran. - Where you from? I'm a student at university in Holland, but this is the place to be in the summer. I'll drink to that. - Should I hit? - Definitely. Hit fast and hard. Twenty-one. Oh, my gosh. You're such good luck. You just got to let the cards know who's boss. - So, are we going or not? - Yeah, we're going. You want to come to Carlos'n Charlie's with us? Lt'll be fun. I don't know. It's not that great on Sundays. Thanks for the help. Now maybe my dad won't kill me. We're out of here. Come on, let's go party. It's our last night. You should come. Hello? Joran, hey. What's up? I just won a couple hundred at blackjack. We're going out tonight, bitch. Here you go. Body shot! Hey. Look who showed, the casino guy. Hey, casino guy. - You like him? - He's got good hair. Waiting in the shop all day. Were you working all day? So, why don't you come dance with us? I had to get a drink. The bar's gonna close soon. Then I better get another drink, too. What do you want? I'll buy. I don't know. What's good? I need two shots. Can you handle it? - So, do I just down it all at once? - Go for it. All in one go. - I told you you'd like it. - I need a chaser. Last call. Last call. - Last call. - So there's hope for her after all. So, do you want to take a body shot off me? Where you been, dude? This place is closing up. Joran's bringing that chick with him. - Satish. - What? Just tell him we're not giving no chicks a ride home. Hey! Bye. We're getting a cab. We're going to the hotel, Hayley. Is it okay? Hey. Have you seen Natalee? I think I saw her over there, somewhere... I think she is getting in a taxi with Brent and Justine. Are you sure? Okay. Natalee! Hey! Nat! What are you doing? Get out of that car. I'm going back to the hotel. Aruba! Hey, guys, it's time to go. The bus leaves in an hour. Where were you? Brent and I and a couple of people sat by the pool all night, talking. I look horrible. I hope I can sleep on the plane. - Was Natalee with you guys? - No. Maybe she crashed in Leann's room. I'm gonna go check her room. Can you call Coach Winter? That's the sound of your vacation ending. Hello? This is she. Jerry? Sure, I remember you, from school. I don't understand. Can you please say that again? All right, have a safe flight, guys. Brent, have a good flight. Okay, bye-bye. I'm not leaving, not without Natalee. Me, neither. Look, I know. I wouldn't want to take off without my best bud, either. But I can't rebook 130 kids just because one of them's late. She's not late. Natalee's never late. Well, fine, distracted, whatever. Now, I'm sure she'll be showing up at the hotel at any minute. I will be there to help her on another flight. But in the meantime, you girls are not gonna miss your plane. Now, is that Natalee's backpack? Think you better leave it with me. Hayley, it's okay. I'll make sure she gets it. Come on. Come on. Now, don't miss your plane. Come on, guys. Have a safe trip. Natalee, honey, it's Mom. Will you call me as soon as you get this? They're telling me you didn't show up for your flight home, and, well, I would really love to hear your voice. So, I hope everything's okay. Call information. Get the number for the FBI office in Birmingham. Beth, honey, you're going like 100 miles an hour. Just pull over, okay? I am not pulling over. Give me the phone. 911? I'm on Highway 78, and my daughter has just been kidnapped. I need to get home. So will you please tell the officer who's trying to get me to pull over to back the hell off? Beth, will you please pull over? You're scaring me. Fine. No. Beth... Stop right there. Let me see your hands. Please, her daughter's been kidnapped. We need help. Please, just help us. I'm on the phone with the hotel manager. He doesn't think we should head down there just yet. He says this kind of thing happens all the time. Tourists wander off. Natalee didn't just wander off. I talked to Hayley. She said Natalee was driven off by three guys in a grey car. Hayley told me she was on her way back to the hotel. Did you hear that? No, no. Tonight. Right now. No. No, thank you. We have a friend that's gonna let us use his plane. Okay. Did you talk to your father? Yeah. He said he's gonna go down tomorrow unless you find her before. All right, honey. I'll call you when we get there. - I love you. - I love you. Jerry. Did Natalee show up yet? Have you found her? I'm sorry, no. Now, I tried to file a report with the police, but they won't consider her a missing person until she's been gone 48 hours. Well, then, we'll just have to find her ourselves. Excuse me. This is my daughter, Natalee. She's missing. - She was last seen with a young man who... - What's going on? Ma'am? Yes, this is my daughter, Natalee. She's missing and she was last seen with a young man who might be a guest here. His name is Jaren or Joran. He has dark hair. Maybe 6 feet tall. - You are talking about Joran van der Sloot. - You know him? Well, he comes into the casino couple of times a week, but he's not a guest. He's a local. Lives not far from here. Thank you for coming. We can give you the name of the witness who saw my daughter get into the car with Joran van der Sloot. We're not investigators, if you hear what I'm saying. We'll talk to him ourselves if you can get us past that gate. No worries. - I want you to wait in the car. - Why? I have the right to ask. We don't even know if he has a gun or how this thing's gonna go down. Humour me. Hate to be disturbing you, sir, but it seems that we have a bit of a sticky situation. This is my stepdaughter. She's missing. She was last seen with your son. Hurry. They're all waiting. Joran says he's coming around the corner. Dad, what's going on? This girl, she's my stepdaughter. Where is she? I don't understand. Why would I know where she is? Her friend saw you with her getting into that car last night at Carlos'n Charlie's. Yes, I know. That's the girl I was drinking with at the bar. And then she asked us for a ride back to her hotel. You think this is funny, son? All right. Then you show us. You get your ass in that car, and you show us where. You don't have to do anything. I am an attorney. - You have not one bit of jurisdiction here. - Dad, it's cool. We have no problem helping them out. Right, Deepak? This is where we dropped her. What do you think, Deepak, right here? It's true. We left her here. She was so drunk, she could hardly get out the car. Hey, do you need help? - Are you okay, miss? - No, no. I'm fine. So, you're saying she hit her head and fell down, and you didn't even get out of the car and help her? The security guy, he helped her. So where is she? I want her back. I want my daughter back. What do you want me to do now? We left her here. What do you want me to do? You've answered their questions. It's late. We're going home. You're just gonna let them go? Why don't you search their car? Mr van der Sloot there is in line to be a judge. I'm not in the mood to piss him off. If you ask me, your daughter is sleeping it off somewhere. Give it a day or two. She'll show up red in the face. Then she'll be in some real trouble, huh? Thank you for letting us have her room. She could come back here, and I just want to make sure we're here in case she comes back. - The teacher asked us to hold it. - Thank you. - Everything's gonna be fine. - I hope you have the best, best time. I will. Her cell phone. She didn't have it with her. Why would she just leave it? It didn't work here, did it? Her phone didn't have international calling. I never... I never... I should have... Oh, my God. Oh, my God. She doesn't have a phone. She could be lying in an alley somewhere, hurt, or locked up in a room by a maniac - doing God knows what to her... - Hey, listen to me. Listen to me. Hey! Natalee is the most strong-willed person on the planet. She'll hold on until we find her, or she'll find us and scold us for taking too long. It's gonna be fine. So, another tourist misses their flight. I can grab their statement if you don't want to deal with it. Haven't you got the phone records to get through for the Patel case? Thanks for reminding me. Excuse me, Detective. We were wondering if the officers who were with us last night filled you in on what happened. What the van der Sloot kid said. Yeah, yeah. I'll be wanting your statements on that. But first I'm gonna eat my Frosted Flakes, and I need a shave. How much longer can they keep us waiting? This is unbearable. Excuse me. I've been waiting two hours for the detective to get back. I don't understand. Doesn't anyone in this building care that my daughter is missing? I can try him on his cell. Sneijder. Tell them we won't be needing them today. - Hey. - What? I have to go take a leak. You're gonna sit down until Frank is finished with you. There's something wrong with these people. We need to go to the American consulate and get someone to light a fire under them. Excuse me. Diana Peterson, Aruba 10 News in Oranjestad. If you want to find your daughter, I am the one who can help you get the word out. I have a 16-year-old daughter. Please, let me help you. What are you doing? They said we had to be there by 2:00. Do you want us to get arrested? That's the girl's mother. She's going on the news. This is turning into a freaking nightmare. Dave. Hi, Beth. Hi, Jug. - You just get in? - Yeah, just got in. This is Brian and Mitch. They're here to help. Any news? Not a damn thing. We're getting nowhere with the cops. I guess we better get out there and start looking. We just stopped by a copy store to order some posters. Excuse me. This is Barbara Waxman, with the US State Department. This is Beth and Jug Twitty, Natalee's parents. Actually, Dave here is Natalee's father. Hello. I was so sorry to hear about your daughter missing her plane. Well, maybe you can tell us why the police don't seem to be interested in helping us find our girl. Well, it hasn't been 48 hours yet. I don't know how many times tourists stretch out their vacation and forget to tell the folks at home. With all due respect, you don't know who you're talking about. - My daughter is not like that. - I don't know what she's like at home, but I do know that a lot of young people end up in choller houses. Crack houses, they're completely legal and... No, no. My daughter is very anti-drugs. Not all tourists end up there voluntarily. Sometimes they're taken there, kept there until the addicts drain their accounts with their ATM cards. What the hell kind of place is this? I told her not to come. I told you. I think I'm giving you the wrong impression here. This isn't a bad place. I've been here nine years, and no tourist has ever been seriously hurt or... Look, I know you're scared. So, don't wait for the police. This is a small island. Everybody knows everybody. If you just start asking around, you're going to find your daughter. I promise you. Thank you. The club is closed, then the girl gets in the backseat with Joran, and then you drive off. And her friend was yelling at her to get out of the car. Nat! What are you doing? Get out of that car. I'm going back to the hotel. Aruba! I can pull over if you want to go back with your friends. Screw that, man. We can give her a ride. She's drunk. It's too much trouble. Shut up. She wants to go, so let's go. I want to go see the sharks. There's no sharks. Come on, Deepak, just keep going. There are so sharks. At the lighthouse, someone told me. Okay, so we'll take you to the lighthouse, right, Satish? Right. - I want to kiss you. - So kiss me. Excuse me. Have you seen this girl? She's missing. - No, sorry. - She was here just a few nights ago. Excuse me. Have you seen this girl? She's missing. She's my daughter. Excuse me. Have you seen this girl? She was here a few nights ago. She's missing. She's my... Have you seen this girl? She was here just a few nights ago. Let's go back to the hotel. I'm gonna get some food in you. No. Natalee may be someplace where she can't eat, and if she can't eat, then I'm not eating. And if she's not sleeping, then I'm not... - Excuse me. Have you seen this girl? - Beth? Beth? - She's missing. She's my daughter. - You're not gonna do her any good - if you run yourself ragged. - Don't even bother. This is Beth. Yes, yes, I'm her mother. What? Where? There she is. By the anchor, just like they said. Natalee! Natalee! Natalee! I'm sorry. Oh, baby. - What colour is your daughter's hair? - She's blond. - And what colour are her eyes? - Blue. And does she have any history of seizures or epilepsy? No. What... Why are you asking me this? I thought you wanted to ask me about Joran van der Sloot. He told some of the kids on the trip with Natalee he was a university student in Holland, here on vacation. He lied. Local boys often pretend to be tourists. It makes it easier for them. Easier for them to what? Meet some girls, have some fun. Is that what Joran and the Kalpoes told you? That they took my daughter to have some fun? No, no, no, no. Their statements all agree. They drove around for a while, and then they dropped her off back at the hotel. - And you believe them? - There's no evidence to suggest otherwise. Look, we're tracking down the security guards from the hotel. We'll find out which one talked to her, and maybe he saw her get into another car or wander off. This island, it's very safe. Tourists get lost all the time, you know, for a week. They always turn up. If someone tells me that one more time, I am gonna lose my mind. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Who's stupid? Joran told Terry the whole thing, about the Natalee chick. Terry just e-mailed me asking if I got a piece of that. And what are you telling him? I'm saying, "Yeah, mofo. She put her hands all the way down in my pants." Why are you telling him that? You have a DVD player in your car? Are you guys rich? - Yeah, we're rich. - Yeah, we're rich. You're kidding. Kidding. She's going to think we're perverts. Turn it off. Very handsome hair. On behalf of Natalee's family, I want to thank you all for being here today and participating in the search for her. For those of you who have time tomorrow morning, - I'd like you to be back here at 9:00 a. m. - Beth. Hi, Jim. - I'm so glad you're here. - Hey, sweetie. I'm glad you're here. Thank you so much for coming, Carol. We've covered a lot of terrain. I know it's been difficult. Carol, Maggie. This is Diana. She's been amazing, helping us with everything. I hope you two have better luck than me getting Beth to take a nap or eat more than two bites. I just wanted to let you know that we're going to re-air your statement from this morning again tonight and tomorrow. Anything until the police agree to invite the FBI to help work on the case. - Thank you. - Okay. Maggie, you can start by logging all the calls we've been getting on the tip lines, and, Carol, you can help me coordinate with the churches back home who are helping raise the reward money. There have been 23 sightings of Natalee on the tip line, 23. She's here on this island somewhere, alive. Today, the Aruba government allowed all government employees to leave work a half-day early and join in the search for Natalee. What's today, Friday? Four and a half days since Natalee disappeared. Yes, we have a medevac plane sitting at the airport, ready to bring her home. The Dutch Marines, they got the sand dunes with a fine-tooth comb. And pretty much from the lighthouse to the hotel's been covered, as well. That's how I knew that the FBI was on its way down. I heard it on the news this morning. CNN gets everything first. It's crazy how the media has swooped down on us here. But if it helps us get our hands on... Can I call you back? I just found out that Natalee's being held in a choller house in St Nicolaas, and they're saying they will release her if you give them $4,000. Where is she? Hey. Who the hell are you? You brought your camera crew? Get out of here. I don't want you here. Make them go away. I don't want them taking pictures of my daughter after she's been held hostage, after who knows what she's been through. You don't understand. The story is big. It's huge. She's not here. Liars! You lied to us! I believed them. - I thought we were about to get her back. - Come on, guys. Get back from the car. I thought I was about to hold her. - Give her a break. Leave her alone. - Hey, come on. Come on. - We've got to try to have faith. - Don't tell me that. You don't know how much I've prayed. Oh, God. Why don't you answer my prayers? I'm the one that invited that guy to the club. - If it wasn't for me... - Stop. It's not your fault. Tonight, as the search grows, two men in custody in connection with Natalee's disappearance. These two security guards worked for the Allegro Hotel. What led police to these two security guys? I'm guessing the three guys that picked her up from the bar. Today, a mattress was discovered with blood on it. Beth! Beth! Do you think Natalee is still alive? Beth! Beth! We heard you provided the police with blood samples. Is that true? Hey, look, she's not gonna talk to you, okay? Leave her alone. Do you think the security guards murdered your daughter? Get her out of here. Look, please, just help us, all right? We would just appreciate it if you could get out the information about the reward, all right? A lot of folks back home have been pitching in, and we're offering $100,000 for Natalee's safe return, and we also have $50,000 for any information leading up to us finding her. It's 1:30. It's 2:00 a. m. It's 2:30. - Stop. - It's not Natalee. - Rewind. Rewind it. - Beth, it's not her. That's Hayley. Keep going. Keep going. Maybe they brought her back later. They lied. Those boys didn't bring her back here. They lied. Just tell me what happened, Joran. I never should have told Terry anything. What the hell did he do? He told his parents what I told him. And they made him go talk to the police. Here. Let us out here. Holiday Inn is back there. I'll walk her on the beach the rest of the way. Come on. We're here, we're here. Let's go. Let's go. Okay. How are you gonna get home? I'll walk, whatever. Watch out. Yeah. We need to talk to Detective Sneijder. Is this about what the test said, about the mattress they found? The results are back? The blood on that mattress didn't belong to... It was dog's blood. They're going to let the security guards go. Okay, then we really need to talk to Sneijder. Well, he's in a meeting right now, but if you want to wait... No, we've done enough waiting. We'll find him ourselves. They're friends. Of course they're friends. That's why they can haul in two security guards while the people last seen with Natalee are free to cover their tracks. They're protecting his son. Is there really nothing else going on in the world? - Thank you very much. - Hi, Mr Bekker. How nice of you... The Prime Minister wants to see you and your captain in his office. - In one hour. - Mr Bekker... Joran, get up. Joran van der Sloot, you are under arrest on charges relating to the disappearance of Natalee Holloway. Why are you doing this, Frank? You know we would have come down. But this makes us look much more ruthless. The Prime Minister's complaining. He says our image is suffering. We're too soft. Complain to him. It's right in there. Here, honey, put that on. All right, listen. You got Blake Hartley first. CNN's at 3:20. ABC's 3:30. And Greta's at 3:45. Hey, sweetie, why don't you put some lipstick on for the cameras? - I don't care about any damn makeup. - Mrs Twitty. - Okay. - Hello. - Hi. - This way. We're ready. Quiet, please. So how's she doing today? I've been worried about her, after the statement the FBI showed her last night. We're rolling. A friend of Joran's told us the boys lied to the police because Joran feared punishment for sneaking out that night. The friend said, "What difference does it make "if we left her at the hotel or on the beach near the hotel?" I think it makes a huge difference if the people who last saw Natalee are telling lies about it. You don't lie to the police or to the mother of a missing child unless you've done something wrong. In his statement, Joran describes Natalee's underwear and other things. I believe that Joran, and possibly Deepak and Satish Kalpoe, slipped Natalee the date-rape drug, then sexually assaulted her, then whisked her away somewhere so she wouldn't talk. I think I have the right to know what the police are doing about it. Earlier today Aruban authorities arrested three suspects... It seems weird it took them 10 whole days to arrest them. I know. At home, they would've started investigating those boys the first night. So they'll have to talk now, right? Tell everyone where they took Nat, - so you can bring her home? - That's the plan. Do you think she's still okay? Of course she's okay. She has to be okay, or... Honey, I need to know that you're okay, too. How are you getting along? You getting plenty to eat? - I kind of don't feel like eating. - Well, baby, you got to eat. Those guys are on TV. They look like jerks. Why would Natalee go anywhere with them? You're snivelling like an eight-year-old. Stop being an idiot. Start using your head. Look at me. All kinds of people from the DA's office, the FBI, are gonna be in here. And they don't know you from nobody. They don't know what I know, that you're a loyal kid, who'd be prepared to lie, to protect his friends. But those friends of yours, are they gonna be so loyal to you? Ain't gonna happen, Joran. So if you know what they did to that little girl, it's time to open your mouth! This is where we were making out. - Did you have sex with her? - No. We were going to, but... - Do you like me? - I like you. I like the beach and the stars and the world all spinny! Spinny. Do you want to do it? Do you? I don't know. Do you have any protection? Sorry. I'm sorry. Don't get all mad. You know I won't. As long as you don't leave me like this. You're sure this is the spot where you last saw her? - Yes, I'm sure. - So, what was she doing? Natalee, hey. Don't fall asleep. I have to take you back. Stay with me. It's nice here. It's so nice. I can't. I have school tomorrow. Natalee. Deepak, hey. It's me. I'm at the beach. I need you to come pick me up. No, no. She's all passed out. You mustn't tell us that you called Deepak if you didn't call him, 'cause we can check the cell phone records. - You'll see it's true. - Then what happened? - Where's your shoes? - I left them on the beach. - So go get them. - No. She's gonna wake up and see me and try to make me stay with her. Why don't you go get them? You didn't tell her you were leaving? You just ditched her? - Let's go, man. - Okay, I'll get them later. So, you're saying that Deepak stopped here to get your shoes, and Natalee was still here? He told Terry that Natalee put her hands down his pants. Ask Terry. He showed it to me on his computer. And what do you think happened? I think Deepak dropped me off at home, came back here, found Natalee and raped her. Then he killed her. Buried her somewhere. - It's not what I'm saying. - So then who is? - But you promised. I have to know. - I'll talk to him and see what I can find out. But when? You want some gum? I want an interview. And in exchange, I'll tell you what Joran is telling the police. Joran! He did it! I didn't. I never touched her! I never touched her! Joran's the one! Joran's the one! He touched her! I never touched her! I never touched her! Also tonight, a theory is growing that 18-year-old American girl Natalee Holloway could be wrapped up in the sex-slave... This is Joran's statement from the day after Natalee went missing? Okay. Okay, I'd say that we don't wait for the police. I say that we go out, and we find these guys, and we beat them until they squeal like the pigs that they are. - If I don't go... I can't lose my job. - I know. If I thought they were doing all they could to find her... I know. I'm not coming back. I'm never coming back here. Yes, the Prime Minister has urged the police department and the District Attorney's office to share all case documents with the FBI. Hey, Barbara. You see him? He's with the Prime Minister's office. He just told whoever's interviewing him that he talks to me at least once a day about the case. I've never even met him. I just... I don't know how I'm supposed to do this. I just talked with the FBI guy. They're saying the way those boys are pointing the finger at each other, they're pretty sure that Natalee is not alive. I'm sorry. I hate that they're making me tell you this. Well, what about all the sightings of her on the tip line? We've also been told that traces of blood have been found in Deepak Kalpoe's car and that one of the boys have confessed and given details of where Miss Holloway is buried. Are you ready, Beth? We're about to go live in 30 seconds. We're ready. Quiet, please. Take me to a church, a chapel. Somewhere I can talk to God. Pull over here. Please. Let me have her back. Give her back to me. She's a good person. She's gonna be a doctor. She's gonna help people. Just tell me what you want. Tell me what I have to do! My little girl is with God now. She's in God's hands. Joran and Natalee, they got out of the car here. - How are you gonna get home? - I'll walk, whatever. - What time was that? - I already made a statement about that. What does that mean? That you don't remember what you told us last time? You keep asking me the same questions. I'm getting sick of it. I know what you're trying to do. The only thing we're trying to do is find out the truth. I've told you the truth. But if I say anything a little different, you'll make it seem as if I am lying, when I'm not. You can't make me answer the same questions. - It is my right not to answer anything. - Okay. Okay. All right. Just tell us what Joran said when he called you that night. Hello? Hey. What are you doing? What do you think I'm doing? I'm walking home. Well, you could have got a ride from me, but, no, you had to get laid. We didn't do it. She gave me a happy ending, though. So, did you take her to her hotel? No, I left her at the beach. She's totally passed out. You left her on the beach? What kind of ass are you? Shut up, man. She has to go home in the morning. Her friends will find her. Still, man, that's cold. Deepak, I can't hear you. I'll talk to you online when I get home. Yeah, okay. You know what this is? The logs from Deepak's computer. He was on the Internet the entire time, the whole time that you said he was giving you a ride home. I never said that Deepak picked me up. I called Deepak, but it was Satish who came to get me. - Where's your shoes? - I left them on the beach. - So go get them. - No. She's gonna wake up and see me and try and make me stay with her. - Why don't you go get them? - You didn't tell her you were leaving? - You just ditched her? - Let's go, man. I never meant that it was Deepak. Satish is the one that showed up! Now no one's gonna believe him. Let's just take a look at some of the issues that have come up during the Natalee Holloway search. First of all, we heard that blood had been found in the car. Then we found blood on a mattress. It was dog's blood. I know, I know, it's crazy. The police department is run by the Arubans, but the government is run by the Dutch, and they just... They don't cooperate. Well, did Joran say he knew where Natalee was buried or not? Did the FBI show you any statements? Did you ask them if they had seen any statements? - I doubt it. - Well, why not? They're working on the case, right? Yeah, well, from what the FBI guy was saying, the police never really let the FBI in on the investigation. Which is kind of what I expected, but I thought, with all the media attention, things would be more different. At least the Venezuelan government is cooperating with them. With who? The FBI? Yeah, they're checking all the calls on the tip line about, you know, the sex-slave thing. Well, you said I should ignore those calls. You should, but the FBI, they've got to rule it out. Great. So now I get to sit here and wonder what's worse, my daughter murdered or a sex slave in Venezuela. Those three bastards. They could end this torture. But they don't care. They just don't give a damn. What's taking so long? Why don't they let us out of here? I should hit you, both of you lying pieces of crap. Who's the liar? Not us. You know what happened with that girl. If you don't know it, then nothing happened. You're the one that has to tell the truth. I'm going to laugh when they find that girl alive. - I hope they do find her. - No, you don't. You're afraid of it, because if you did something bad to her, then everyone will know. - We are not afraid. You should be. - I didn't do anything! I left her asleep! I told you that night, Deepak! You gonna deny it? The judge just signed the order for your release. Your mother is here to take you home. Not you, Joran. Two suspects were released yesterday who were involved in a violent crime against my daughter. I am asking all nations to hear my plea. Do not allow the Kalpoe brothers to enter your country until this case is solved. Do not allow these criminals to walk among your citizens. Do not allow them to get away with this crime, in the name of my beautiful, intelligent, outstanding daughter, whom I have not seen in 36 days and for whom I will continue to search until I find her. Thank you. I really wish you hadn't done that, called the Kalpoes criminals. It's just not good. Not good? You're the one who said there's a transcript of Deepak saying he had sexual contact with Natalee. - I think that makes him a criminal. - I'm not saying he's not. I'm just saying that the locals are gonna not like it. I think the locals will understand that it's the Kalpoes and Joran who are causing all this trouble. Excuse me, but you've been here, what, five weeks? They're from here. Aren't you supposed to be on our side? Okay, this is the problem. You think there's sides, and there's not. It's just a big mess. You think they should do things here the way they do things at home, - but they don't. It's not the same. - That much, we've figured out. So why are you going on TV every two minutes telling everyone how screwed up the island is? I never say bad things about Aruba. And I do those interviews because the media is all I've got. - They're the only ones who seem to care. - You think I don't care? I am the one that's been defending Natalee. When the media were spreading rumours about her being drunk the whole time she was here, or buying crack, I defended her. And this is the thanks I get? - You want us to thank you? - Jug. - As useless as you've been? - Stop. It won't help anything. Stop. My husband, he helped look for the missing girl. - And you? Did you help in the search? - No, no. I have a friend, she works here. She said she saw Natalee a bunch of times with a Dutch boy. I don't understand these people. Don't they have children of their own? My friend thinks they ran away together. She heard the mother was very strict, and Natalee didn't want to go home. Go home! Go home! Go home! Go home! Go home! Go home! Go home! Thank you. I have a photo I'd like to have copied, please. - Do you want a colour copy? - Yes, I do. It's a picture I took of Natalee on her graduation day. It's an amazing thing to watch your child graduate. You think about how you rocked them as a baby, how you helped her learn to walk, to read, to ride her bike. You think about how you spent every waking hour of the last 18 years making sure that she was safe and loved and taken care of. And then there she is, beautiful and happy, with an amazing life ahead of her. Did you try to help Natalee, Deepak? Or did you just sit there and watch while she fought for her life? No, I don't think you just watched. You said she put her hands in your pants. I'll bet you anything she said no. And you didn't like that, did you? Did you have to hold her down while Joran raped her? Or was she already unconscious? This is a prayer bracelet, made by Natalee's friends back home, friends who miss her desperately, like I do. I have a lot more photos, and I'll be here every day until you do the right thing and tell me what happened to my daughter. - Hey. - Hey. You should see this letter from Deepak's attorney, saying I harassed him, and that they'll press charges if I ever dare to talk to him again. What? What is it? The judge said there's not enough evidence to hold him. - Joran. - Does this mean you are innocent? Is it true you're moving back to Holland? Are you leaving Aruba? That's it. It's time to lay down our swords and go home. It doesn't matter what we do, they just keep covering up the truth. Like it's none of my damn business what happened to my own child! I don't know if I can leave without Natalee. I don't think I can. Thanks for letting us talk with Joran. I understand the whole family's moving to Amsterdam. Yes. And people need to know that Joran is a normal kid, like everyone else. He will start college in a few weeks in Holland. He's going to study the law, like I did. Great. Okay, before we turn the cameras on, we should go over what we'll be talking about. Joran, I'll be asking you about how you met Natalee and what happened once you two were dropped off at the beach. Are you willing to talk about that? I'll tell you everything that happened there. I wish I'd met you earlier, like the first day. - Yeah, we could've had a lot of fun. - I had fun tonight! You're the first guy I've ever kissed that made my heart beat like crazy. I should be getting home. Walk you back? No, I don't want to go back yet. It's my last night. Stay out here with me. I can't. I have to go to school tomorrow, and I don't want to leave you here alone. - Let's just look at the stars. - Fine. - I'll carry you back. - Put me down! Put me down! - And did you stay with her? - For a little while. We were lying on our backs, looking at the stars, and then she fell asleep. So I called my friend Deepak and told him to come pick me up. - And did he come? - Yes. Well, I mean, I thought it would be Deepak, but when I got to the car, it was Satish who was driving. So you just left Natalee there, sleeping on the beach, alone? I didn't plan it, but when I got to the car, Satish said, "Let's go," so I just got in the car. I didn't go back and tell her I was leaving, and that's not very nice, but it's the one thing I regret. You've told several different stories about what happened that night. - Why should anyone believe you now? - I don't expect anyone to believe me. I wouldn't believe me, either, but it's the truth. The investigation into the disappearance... - That's it. ...of Natalee Holloway is ongoing... I'm gonna get a lawyer, and I'm gonna file a wrongful-death suit against him. - Beth. - Joran is going to college, and where's Natalee? Somebody has to make him pay. And if an Aruban judge won't do it, then maybe an American judge will. Slow down a minute. You know what Joran's lawyers are gonna say. They're gonna say maybe Deepak went back to the beach and found her, - or Satish. - That's not what happened. Or maybe the boys tried to blame each other 'cause none of them are guilty. And someone else came along and found her and carried her off. - That's not what happened! - Or maybe she woke up on her own, and she decided to go for a swim and drowned. - That's not what happened. - How do you know? I don't! Okay? I don't know what happened! But I think that maybe if I could just hold onto Joran and squeeze him hard enough, maybe the truth will come out. A lawsuit's not gonna be much of a squeeze if a judge dismisses it. In the meantime, you're just keeping yourself here in this misery. This isn't about me! This is about Natalee. - And she is worth the effort. - I'm not talking about Natalee's worth here. I don't want you talking about it at all. This is my decision. Hello, murderer. Do you have something to say to me? If you're looking for a job, girl killer. You said you couldn't go back to work because you couldn't be in a classroom with a bunch of kids. Now you're flying off to be with a bunch of kids! This is important. If I can stop one kid from ending up like Natalee, just one... Natalee will still be gone. What? I'm not supposed to say it? She's gone. But we're still here. What? You want me to move on. Is that it? Because you're ready to move on? I can't. I don't know what happened to my daughter. And when I try to find out, you try to talk me out of it. - That is not true. - You have no idea what it feels like to have this horrible fear trapped right here, a fear that she's suffered even worse than I've imagined. I can't move on until I find out what happened. Maybe if she were your daughter, you could understand that! - I miss her, too. - I'm sorry. I know that doesn't sound very nice, but it's how I feel. - Mom? Are you okay? - Yeah. So, how was it? Your first day of 11th grade. People stared at me. What are we waiting for? Aren't we gonna go pick up the drugs? I think you should stay here. Your face has been all over the TV. They're gonna recognise you, the girl killer. Screw you, man. Stop calling me that. You want me to tell you what happened to her? Hell, no. I don't want to hear about that. Drug dealers are paranoid. I don't want you setting them off. You stay in the car. - We're good. - Watch your back. Easy. - This was in the box of bathroom stuff. - Lord, I don't know how that got in there. Not that this is a bad house or anything, but I don't get why you're divorcing. - You guys still love each other? - Yes, we do, honey. - That's why we're doing this, for each other. - I just... I don't think Natalee would have wanted this to happen. She'd be really upset. Well, then, she shouldn't have got in the car with Joran van der Sloot. Matt, I'm sorry. I... Oh, Lord. I didn't mean that. What is it? What happened? I did something stupid. Good dope, huh? We get a kilo of that and move it, I'm telling you, we'll make a load of cash. Yeah. All right, listen, if we're gonna go into business together, I have to know if I can trust you. You know you can trust me. You know you can. If I gotta trust you, then you got to trust me. You got to tell me everything that happened with that girl in Aruba, so I can be sure it's not gonna come back and, you know, bite me in the ass. So what the hell happened? - This is Beth. - This is Peter de Vries. I'm a crime reporter in Holland. I know it's early there. I hope I didn't wake you. No, no, no. I'm up. I've been investigating Joran van der Sloot for quite a few months now, and I think you're going to want to get on a plane for Holland as soon as possible. So, you're saying Joran didn't know that he was being taped by his friend? I'm no friend of that piece of crap. I can promise you that. Patrick only pretended to be Joran's friend, and they drove around in an SUV that we provided to him, full of cameras. If you're ready now to watch the footage, but it's going to be very difficult for you. Okay. - All right. Stand by, everybody. - Quiet, please. We're on in five, four, three... You know what it's like there, Patrick. These girls, man, they come down from the States when they're done with school. They're ready to cut loose, man, ready to party. So, this girl, Natalee? She was just this girl hanging out with her friends. I wasn't really into her that much, but she wanted a drink, and I'm like, "Why not?" You know? Then the place closed, and she asked me for a ride. - So you gave her a ride. - It was the gentleman thing to do. All right, listen, if we're gonna go into business together, I have to know if I can trust you. You know you can trust me. You know you can. If I gotta trust you, then you got to trust me. You got to tell me everything that happened with that girl in Aruba, so I can be sure it's not gonna come back and, you know, bite me in the ass. - Fine, I'll tell you. - So what the hell happened? - Morta. She's dead, isn't she? - You think I killed her? - Do you like me? - Yes. - Do it on the beach? - Wait. - No. - I'm really turned on. Do you want to do it? What the hell? I swear to God, Patrick, it was like in a movie, all the things she was doing. - What, shaking? - A lot, man. - So I'm like, "What the hell? What is this?" - How long was she shaking for? Do you even know what it is? Is it an epileptic attack or something? Natalee? Are you all right? Natalee? So, I'm talking to her, I'm talking to her. She says nothing, she says nothing. And she's not ticking any more. I'm panicking, you know? - Yeah, of course you were. - I was almost ready to cry. It's like, "Why does this stuff have to happen to me?" So I grab her arms. Hey, it's Joran. Can you meet me? Something's happened, something really bad. Then what? We're looking down at her, and she looks sweet, you know? What, she's just lying still? Still, still. She's not doing anything, and my friend is like, "Yeah, she's dead." - So, who was this guy? - A friend. I'm not gonna tell you his name, because all this time, he's never talked about it. And I'm not gonna talk about it. It wasn't my father or anything, but a really good friend. He told me to go to school and act like nothing happened. So it was your father, wasn't it? Only your father would care whether you made it to school the next day or not. - I'm telling you, man, it wasn't my father. - So how far out did he take her? Not even 2 kilometres, he said. But the ocean is big, you know. Yeah, the sea is big, man. Did he weigh her down with anything? No. That's why I'm lucky she was never found. If she turned up, I'd be in big trouble. What about Deepak and Satish? Do they know all this? No, they didn't know anything, man. They're stupid. They didn't even argue when I said we should lie about dropping her off at the hotel. It was the smartest thing I did. It confused everybody. - No one could figure anything out. - Yeah, you sure played it smart, all right. The only thing I didn't expect was that her bitch of a mother would be such a pain in the ass. She turned the whole thing into a circus. What I want to know is, how can you be so sure the girl was dead? - People go into comas. - I wasn't sure about that. - Did you check for a pulse? - No. But it didn't look good. So it's possible that she was still alive? I guess it's possible. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. She could have been alive when he threw her over! That son of a bitch. She could have been alive! You got it all. You got every bit of it. I don't think so. I don't think he told us everything. There's got to be a reason why he decided to make Natalee disappear, instead of calling for help. Either he raped her or... Or he drugged her. Which would explain a seizure in an otherwise healthy girl. You should know that when I finally told him that I was taking him for a ride, he said he made it all up, that he was trying to impress me. No. I think, for once in his life, Joran finally told the truth. It's over. This is the end. This is what I prayed for. To know. I just needed to know. Do you remember how Lieutenant Sneijder asked us on the second day - if Natalee had a history of seizures? - Yeah. Yeah. I remember. I bet you anything he already knew what happened. You got to tell me everything that happened with that girl in Aruba, so I can be sure it's not gonna come back and, you know, bite me in the ass. I'll bet you Joran or his father told Sneijder that first day, and he kept it a secret, letting as much suspicion as possible land on Deepak and Satish. Deepak and Satish? Do they know all this? They're stupid, man. They didn't know anything. They didn't even argue when I said we should lie about dropping her off at the hotel. Well, I wouldn't put it past him. - Did you tell Matt yet? - I just called him a minute ago. He said, "Mom, I can already hear the peace in your voice." You finally got your answers, Beth. I'm happy for you. I can't let all that loss be for nothing. This is Natalee on her graduation day. She was so excited, I could barely get her to stand still for this picture. You can see she's wearing the cords she earned for the National Honour Society, the Math Honour Society, and the Spanish Honour Society. She was so together, so smart. This was her last night in Aruba. She was there with over 100 classmates. So, of course, she felt completely safe when she went out that night. And why wouldn't she feel safe? She was doing exactly what everybody else down there was doing, celebrating with her friends, having fun. She was a smart girl. It never occurred to her or to me that she wouldn't recognise danger when it crossed her path. But when you're away from home, in an unfamiliar place, danger does not look like what you expect. You can't let your guard down, even for a moment. You have to make sure you don't get into a situation where you lose control and you can't make your own decisions. Plan how you will end your evening. Plan how you'll get home, even more than you plan the beginning. And no matter what happens, stick to your plan. And most important of all, never get into a car with a stranger, no matter how safe you may feel. Don't do it. Don't do it. Please, don't do it. We want you to come home. We want all of you to come home.
