KUMIKO THE TREASURE HUNTER Review. Synchronization by Angel Look, I permed my eyelashes! Cute! That's awesome. When do you do it? Guess how much? Around 10,000 yen? No, not that expensive. 5,600 yen? Who would pay 6,000 yen for this set? Recently, they've had good coupons. Are those extensions? They're real and permed. Mako, with your glasses, do your lashes get stuck like this? Thank you. Did you let it steep enough? Yes, sir. Because you didn't the last time. Yes sir, I did this time. I need you to go by the cleaners today, I have two suits that need to be dropped off. Yes, sir. That is all. Welcome. Trousers. Jacket. More trousers, striped. Kumiko! Kumiko? Kumiko, is that you? It's Michi, remember? Michi. What a coincidence! I'm so happy to see you! I looked up and thought that was definitely you. I ran so much. When did I see you last? It's been years. It's been a while. That's right. How have you been? I've been fine. That's good to hear. - How about you? - I'm good. Let's go to a cafe. We have lots to catch up on. You busy now? OK... What about...? Give me your phone number. Let's get together soon! Jesus Christ... Hello. Kumiko? Kumiko? Yes? Good morning. This is your mother. I know. Hello, Mom. I figured I might catch you before work. Why don't you ever answer your phone or return your email? I do. I've been very busy. I haven't heard from you in a long time. What's new? Have you gotten a promotion yet? Yes. When? Today. Good job. Are you dating anyone? No. You should move back home until you're married. No. You'd be able to save money. You never should've left home in the first place. Kumiko? This is not a book that can leave the building. It needs to stay here. Why don't you just make a photocopy? Or go get it off the internet? I am willing to make it worth your while. I'm sorry, I can't accept that. That's against the rules. What do you need it for? I am like a Spanish Conquistador. Recently, I've learned of untold riches hidden deep in the Americas. Long ago, Spanish Conquistadors learned of such things from the American Indians. Now, I have learned from an American motion picture. I don't understand. I only need page 95. It is my destiny. You must leave now. Don't come back. I can't make a habit of this. That's OK. Please sit down. Go ahead, have a seat. I need to talk to you for a moment. You appear to have an increasingly poor disposition. Your co-workers have been aware of it for a while. Are you unhappy here? No, not at all. Please have the decency to look at me when you're speaking. I'm sorry, sir. I've always enjoyed working here, sir. What are your plans? What do you mean, sir? You know, long term. After being an Office Lady. How old are you? Twenty-nine. As I'm sure you know, most of the other managers here have Office Ladies who are married by twenty-five... unless they choose to move on in their career. At your age, they most likely have a family. With all clue respect, sir, we all have our own path. Do you currently have a boyfriend? No, not right now. If you don't mind me asking... Are you a homosexual? No, not at all. - Are you sure? - Of course. Well, you know, there's lots of fresh, young girls wanting to be... And when older people don't make room, it can hold them up. Sorry I'm late. - Did you order anything yet? - No, not yet. It's so nice to see you. It's been a while. How have you been? Good. What's your boy's name? Actually, she's a girl. Her name is Mayo. She's almost 5 years old. So cute. Yeah, takes after Daddy. She's really smart too. I really have to run to the restroom. Would you mind watching her? OK, back in a second. Be good, Mayo. You're late again. Mr. Sakagami is looking for you. I'm sorry, I wasn't feeling well this morning. Are we having a meeting? Not really. Kumiko? Yes! Sir? Please report to my office immediately. Yes, sir. I'm sorry I'm late. Have you thought about our conversation? I don't know. Maybe. I'd like to introduce you to Ms. Kanazaki. She's going to be helping us out here. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Tomorrow is my wedding anniversary. I need you to get a gift for my wife... Something nice. OK. - What should I get? - I really don't care. Just make it something nice. Yes, sir. Use my company card. Now, I would like some tea. Bunzo. I'm sorry. But I hope you can forgive me. We must part ways from this point forward. I wish it could be another way. I'm sorry. I have important things to do. You're free now. Go wherever you want to go. Now you go, Bunzo. You're free. Bunzo. Get moving. Why don't you go? Bunzo! Do what you like, Bunzo! You're free now! Bunzo! Move it! Bunzo! Hello? Hello. Kumiko? Who? Kumiko. Why aren't you calling on your cell phone? I dropped it by accident and it broke. So I'm calling on a different one. I couldn't sleep, and I wanted to talk to you. Oh, OK. How are you? Good. And you? I'm fine. What's new? Well... To be honest, a lot of things are. How's your promotion? Good?. But, I have something much more important happening. You're engaged? No. It's much more important. I am on the brink of an incredible discovery... Are you pregnant? Is this what it's all about? No. That's not what this is about. Well, if you're not going to get married, you need to move back home with me. Stop wasting everyone's time. Hello? Hello? Hi Mom. It's me. Where are you! Are you there? Where are you? Mom, I have a favor to ask. I was wondering if you could wire me some money. I can pay you back very soon, I promise. I got a call from your work earlier! Did you hear me? I said your work called. Why? They're very angry- They said you haven't shown up for three days, that you stole their company credit card! - What the hell is going on? - Nothing. They're lying. The other girls at work were jealous of me, they're making up lies to get me in trouble. That's all. There's nothing to worry about. Everything is fine. If they call again, ignore it. It's lies. Why would they do that? You're the liar! Why would they be jealous of you? You're not dating anyone, you're not getting married. And you don't even want to live with your mother. You've shamed me! You've once again ruined a good job, and now you're a liar and a thief! I have to go now. I'm very busy, I have very important things to do. You can't even imagine how important they are. Good-bye. Thief! Give it back! The treasure... I found it! I was right after all. I did it! Bunzo. Let's go. KUMIKO - THE TREASURE HUNTER Review.
