(MultiCom jingle) (crashing and yelling) (epic music) (dramatic music) (yelling) (yelling) (yelling) (yelling) (dramatic music) - [Narrator] His death at an early age has led some to call him the James Dean of martial arts cinema. He combined a dancer's grace with deadly skills. (yelling) (gentle music) Despite the prejudice he experienced, he helped bring martial arts to America and sought to build a cultural bridge between East and West. With his superb abilities being matched by great onscreen charisma, he quickly became a cult figure. His life was marked by fighting with external enemies and battling inner demons. His mysterious death only added to the enigma of his life. He was the one and only Bruce Lee. (yelling) February 1965, a young actor is given a screen test. - [Director] Bruce Lee screen test, scene eight, take one. (snapping) - My last name is Lee, Bruce Lee. - [Narrator] He is cheerful, personable, just a little bit nervous about appearing before the camera. It is when he demonstrates his real skill that the beginner proves to be the master. When he shows he truly is in control and what would make him a movie legend. - There is a finger jab, there is a punch. There is a (speaking quickly) and then low. Of course, then they use legs, straight in the groin, or come up. (laughing) They have the tiger, that starts like a tiger. Use the claw to claw the face, or to (speaking quickly) the eyes. - [Narrator] As typical for a screen test, he is asked a little background information. - [Director] And you worked in motion pictures in Hong Kong? - Yes, since I was around six years old. - [Director] And when did you leave Hong Kong? - 1959, when I was 18. - [Narrator] He was born Lee Jun-fan in San Francisco on November 27, 1940 in the Chinese year of the dragon. (gentle music) His maternal grandfather was German, making the young Lee three quarters Asian and one quarter Caucasian. As often the case with Asians in regular contact with Westerners, along with a traditional Chinese name, he was also provided a Western-style given name, Bruce. Although America was the place of his birth, Lee spend his youth in the British protectorate of Hong Kong. His early years were marked with uncertainty. In December of 1941, Japan took possession of Hong Kong, and the protectorate was occupied by Japanese troops throughout the war. After the war, Hong Kong reverted back to British control, an unhappy fact to those Chinese who resented any foreign domination. In 1949, mainland China fell to the Communists under Mao Zedong and Hong Kong felt the threat of invasion. Nevertheless, Hong Kong boomed with activity, becoming a center of trade. It was also the center of prolific motion picture production. Coming from a family of actors, Lee began appearing in movies as a child under the name Lei Siu Long, having his first film role when he was only two months old. Over the years, Lee appeared off and on in Hong Kong movies, mostly small roles. But he was a restless youth. His father was often away, touring with a Cantonese opera company. Left without supervision, the young Bruce ran with street gangs. To avoid getting beaten up in the brawls that he became involved in, Lee began learning martial arts. After studying several different forms of Chinese kung fu, he settled on the Wing Chun style. Only later did Lee embrace the philosophies embodied in the study of martial arts. (upbeat horn music) Along with learning self defense, Lee became quite a good dancer, which provided additional grace in his kung fu. His acting career also developed, gaining him fans as he grew into manhood with handsome, boyish features. (gentle music) He appeared in a dozen films in supporting roles, mostly as a cheerful youth with teen heartthrob appeal. The future action hero was in little evidence. However his early films do show his screen presence which would someday help make him a star. However, to the annoyance of his father, he continued getting involved in conflicts with street gangs. In a scene from Fists of Fury, Lee poked fun at the promise he'd made to his parents not to get involved in any more street brawls. - You promised. - [Narrator] His character wears an amulet on which he swore to his mother he would no longer get into fights. His parents also disapproved of both his on again, off again acting career and his studying kung fu. (epic action music) (yelling) His father concluded that Bruce should take advantage of his American birth certificate and sent him to live in the United States. (gentle music) In Seattle, Washington, Bruce finished high school and started college. There he met Linda Emery, who would become his life's true love. They had their first date at the restaurant in the Seattle Space Needle, a year later, they would marry. Lee continued his education at the University of Washington as a philosophy major. Forever restless and admitting he was a poor student, Lee soon dropped out of college. (jazzy music) More interested in teaching than in learning, he instead opened up two martial arts schools. His training of Caucasians drew the ire of some of his fellow martial artists who thought that kung fu should be reserved for Asians only. Lee was challenged to a duel with the condition that if he lost, he could no longer teach kung fun to non-Asians. (yelling) Lee won the contest but the length of time it took him to defeat the challenger caused him to reevaluate his style of kung fu. Declaring that he rejected any particular style as being too restrictive, he resolved to learn all schools of martial arts, akido, taekwondo, kung fu, karate, judo, and others. He would also teach to all who were willing to learn, regardless of race. His philosophy of using a kick when you need to kick, a punch when you need to punch, broke with the traditional martial arts school's methods of teaching. Lee named his school of thought Jeet Kune Do, the way of the intercepting fist, which taught live fencing, to use a punch and a block simultaneously rather than blocking then punching. He adapted other techniques into his form, throwing out traditional styles if he thought them inefficient. He scorned the breaking of boards and bricks as mere tricks, saying if you want to break something, use a hammer. With the success of his schools, Hollywood came calling, offering him a screen test. This revived his interest in acting and with going back into movies. Now married and with his son Brandon born in February 1965, Lee had a family to support and was eager to make it big in Hollywood. His screen test revealed the ease, charm, and onscreen charisma that would distinguish his movies from the wannabes who followed the wave of his success. The part he was testing for was that of number one son of Charlie Chan, the famed detective from dozens of movies for a prospective TV series about the Chinese sleuth. Asians still faced prejudice and typecasting in Hollywood, and even someone as personable as Bruce would have a hard time breaking through these barriers, even in a stereotyped role. (gentle music) As it was, the Charlie Chan TV series never came to fruition, yet another oriental import was picking up speed in movies, and it was through this that Lee was propelled into Hollywood. Martial arts were slowly becoming the rage in films. Various forms of unarmed combat began appearing more regularly in movies, but it was another fad that would provide Bruce with his breakthrough. The Batman craze was in full swing. (epic music) A spin off of the popular Batman television series, The Green Hornet, featured another comic book crime fighter, this time based on the classic radio drama. (buzzing) The hero was Britt Reid, a literal and figurative descendant of the Lone Ranger, as both radio shows were created by the same people. Like his great grandfather the Lone Ranger, wealthy newspaper man Reid donned the mask and secret identity to fight crime under the alias the Green Hornet. And like the Lone Ranger, he had a subservient minority sidekick, a Japanese houseboy and chauffer named Kato who assisted him on his crime fighting adventures. (jazzy music) The Green Hornet producer saw Lee's screen test and knew he had found his Kato. Lee hesitated taking the stereotypical role of the servant but he had a family to support. Moreover, Lee would transform his role, not only from a Japanese caricature to a Chinese character, but make him a dynamic sidekick with the emphasis on dynamic kicking. Even though Kato handled most of the menial tasks and the Green Hornet did most of the talking, no houseboy would ever sit on the desk in front of his employer. And the series showed the crime fighter team in a true partnership as equals, though it was always clear who was in charge. When the duo swung into action, Lee as Kato was shown to best advantage. (dramatic music) Fighting crime often became literal, and the Green Hornet and Kato beat up the bad guys with their devastating kung fu, all choreographed by Lee himself. Kato handled the thorny problem of martial artists opposing gun play by literal use of hand thrown darts. (dramatic music) Van Williams played the title character of the Green Hornet. He befriended Lee and became his student. Diane McBain, who appeared as Pinky on a two part show which double teamed the Green Hornet and Kato with Batman and Robin remembered Bruce Lee. - I owned the pink stamp factory, (laughing) and they were trying to make stamps out of Batman and Robin and the Green Hornet too. That was one of those combination shows when they got together, it was an hour show, a two parter, and Batman and the Green Hornet came together to solve the crime. He was not a huge star at the time, he was second string in this particular case. He certainly was very clever, of course, with his martial arts because he did know how to do that very well and that was a part of the show. And so that was very impressive. - [Narrator] Despite the popularity of Lee and the series, The Green Hornet was canceled after just one season. (dramatic music) Lee discovered, as many stars of canceled TV shows also found, how fleeting was glory. But Lee's expertise in martial arts earned him a position as fight coordinator on one of the Matt Helm movies, The Wrecking Crew, starring Dean Martin. Here's a fight segment he choreographed with stars Sharon Tate and Nancy Kwan, though neither actress was destined to become a skilled martial artist. (dramatic Asian style music) (groaning) (yelling) (groaning) (screaming) Also working on the movie along with Lee as a stunt extra was a young martial artist named Chuck Norris. Lee did fight choreography in other movies as well, such as A Walk in the Spring Rain. (gentle music) More often, he trained the actors in the martial arts they used in their films. Lee became the instructor to the stars, charging $250 an hour to teach fighting techniques. (exciting music) His celebrity pupils included Steve McQueen, director Roman Polanski, basketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and James Coburn. - Bruce Lee was a great friend of mine We used to work out together for a long time. It was very close, we were very close friends. - [Narrator] It was Lee who taught Coburn the techniques he would use in the Bond-style spy spoofs, Our Man Flynt and In Like Flynt. - His whole life was related to martial arts. He lived, breathed, thought, moved, everything was dedicated to the highest principle of his own self evolution, he created himself. Bruce Lee was a little Chinese guy who demanded of himself great excellence, I mean he was a true artist in that respect, he created himself. (dramatic music) - [Narrator] Screenwriter Stirling Silliphant also became Lee's student and wrote a tailor made part for Lee in a TV show. In several episodes of Longstreet, Lee played a martial arts expert who teaches self defense to a blinded detective played by James Franciscus. Silliphant also wrote Lee one of his rare villainous roles. In the 1969 movie Marlowe, Lee played the part of Winslow Wong, a thug sent to intimidate detective Philip Marlowe, played by James Garner. Lee nearly stole the picture with demonstrations of what was called kung fu. - [Announcer] Mr. Winslow Wong is freaking out. He's trying to make a move on Mr. Philip Marlowe. What Wong doesn't know is that Marlowe's a tough guy to trouble. - [Narrator] Garner was so impressed by Lee that he hired the martial artist to give him lessons. (gentle music) Other students such as Steve McQueen and James Coburn also helped Lee get parts in Hollywood. However Lee was constantly frustrated by racial discrimination and Hollywood's lack of interest in the projects he wanted to pursue. Lee's resentment boiled up into arguments with friends and supporters. A project to film Lee's script, The Silent Flute, came apart after conflict with collaborator and chief backer James Coburn. Racism in America and typecasting in Hollywood led to one scene in The Chinese Connection in which Lee was able to vent his rage over the prejudice he encountered. (dramatic music) (yelling) (yelling) Fed up with Hollywood treatment, Lee went back to Hong Kong where he became involved again with the emerging Chinese cinema. In Hong Kong, a vibrant film industry was flourishing, eager for new stars. Movies had been regularly produced there since the 1920s, but after the second World War and the fall of mainland China to Communists, Hong Kong became the main source of Chinese language films in the world. Today, it is the third largest producer of feature films, after India and the United States. In the early 1970s, martial arts films began to proliferate. Kung fu movies were starting to appear more regularly, mixing traditional style martial arts with Peking opera style acrobatics. These were kinetic, fantastic, and often outrageous, and Lee fitted right in with his grace, agility, ability, and good looks. Hong Kong welcomed Lee as a major star, since The Green Hornet had been televised there, retitled The Kato Show. Lee brokered his fame into getting the starring roles in kung fu movies, signing a two picture deal with film producer Raymond Chow. The first was a modern day martial arts saga, The Big Boss, shot on location in Thailand. The Big Boss was released in the United States as Fists of Fury. Lee played a youth sent by his parents out of Hong Kong to relations in Thailand to keep him out of trouble, much as Lee himself was sent to America by his father. - Good luck, Cheng. (gentle music) - [Narrator] He arrives at a small village in Thailand where he gets work with his friends at an ice factory. Unbeknownst to them, the ice factory is run by drug smuggling gangsters, they ruthlessly killed anyone who stumbles onto their operation. (yelling) - Come on, hurry, hurry! (grunting) (yelling) (yelling) - [Narrator] Naturally, when these friends start disappearing, he is obliged to investigate and gets into predictable trouble. (yelling) - Get, go! Go on! - [Narrator] Again and again, Lee is forced to break his clause about not getting into fights. - You know, I broke a promise never to fight again. (yelling) - [Narrator] A classic Lee touch is found in his films. When wounded by an opponent, Lee tastes his own blood to drive him to greater fury, turning a setback to an advantage. (yelling) The trail of bodies leads him to the big boss, the head gangster who owns the factory, and the two pair off in the final furious battle. (yelling) (yelling) Onscreen combat was matched behind the scenes. Argumentative, opinionated, and always striving for perfection, Lee feuded constantly with director Lo Wei during the making of the film. After the production wrapped, Lee dismissed the director as an incompetent hack while Lo took credit for Lee's becoming a superstar. Despite the clashing wills, Fists of Fury was a tremendous success in Hong Kong and in Asia. Gangsters were very much a part of Hong Kong life, and they made their presence felt off screen as well as on. (gentle music) Lee was pressured with money and threats to place himself under the thumb of mob influence. He was not intimidated. Knowing he risked running afoul of the gangs, Lee fearlessly campaigned for better pay and working conditions for the stunt performers and other below the line personnel in the Hong Kong film industry. He made enemies, but he also made loyal friends. Higher production values were noticeable in Lee's next movie, the Fist of Fury, shot in Hong Kong studios. (dramatic music) The movie starts with Lee arriving to find his beloved master had died under mysterious circumstances. - Where are they? - Around the back, they're in (mumbling). - Let's go then. - Yeah. - [Narrator] Set in Shanghai in 1908, the film told of a Chinese kung fu school being bullied by overbearing Japanese martial artists from a local karate school. - Eh, why so shy? What's wrong, lost your tongue? Really, what a group, just nothing but kids. There's not a man among you! - [Narrator] Distraught over the death of his teacher and provoked by the arrogant Japanese, he goes to their school to teach them a lesson. (yelling) (yelling) Soon Lee learns it was the Japanese who poisoned his teacher. (yelling) - So why did you kill my teacher then? Why did you kill my teacher? Why, why, why, why? Why did you kill my teacher? (dramatic music) - [Narrator] Ultimately Lee's quest for vengeance takes him to furious duels to the death with the karate school's top masters. (dramatic music) (yelling) - Hold it! - [Narrator] Although on the surface a tale of rivalry between Chinese and Japanese martial art schools, some read political overtones in the tale of overbearing Japanese oppressing Chinese. At the heart of the movie is the domination of China by foreigners, particularly the Japanese, who exercised considerable bigotry against the Chinese in their military campaigns against China and frequent economic exploitation. There was plenty of resentment against Japan during its rapid domination of the Asian economies. Even though the film's grim message was of confrontation and revenge, Lee got to show off some of his humorous side, such as playing a telephone repairman spying on the Japanese. (suspenseful music) (knocking) - Good afternoon there, I'm from the telephone company. - [Narrator] He also played an old man selling a newspaper to the policeman searching for him. - Sir. Why not try to get back to Jingwu School. (dramatic music) - [Narrator] Karate champion Bob Wall played a Russian boxer hired by the Japanese to kill Lee. Although always defeated in the end, Wall had the privilege of being Lee's opponent in four of his movies. (yelling) (cymbal crashing) When ready for its debut in the United States, the original title of Fist of Fury was too close to Fists of Fury, the American release title for Lee's earlier movie. Because The French Connection was a big movie the year before, the American release company renamed Lee's new film The Chinese Connection. Lee's second kung fu film was a major hit, outgrossing the previous all-time blockbuster in Hong Kong, The Sound of Music. - [Announcer] He's unstoppable. Unbeatable. Unbelievable. (yelling) He's Bruce Lee, the master of karate and kung fu delivering The Chinese Connection. (yelling) - [Narrator] The Chinese Connection was even popular in Japan despite the anti-Japanese rhetoric. Bruce Lee became Asia's top star, and Hollywood finally began noticing the actor it had so frequently snubbed. The 1960s had witnessed a lot of change, and by the '70s, Western audiences were more willing to accept a non-white star in the lead role. (funky music) Blaxploitation movies became the rage, and competing at the local theaters and drive ins were a trickle of Chinese martial arts movies. Meanwhile, Lee went off to Rome to film his third kung fu movie, Way of the Dragon. This time, he had total control over the production, which he both wrote and directed. Although hampered by a small budget, the movie showed Lee to best advantage, mixing martial arts flaymboyance with good natured wit. A fan of Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone spaghetti Westerns, such as A Fistful of Dollars, Lee incorporated the feel of Leone's films in his movies. Traces of Eastwood's Man with No Name could also be seen in Lee's performances. Again, Lee tangles with gangsters, this time inept Italian mafioso trying to take over the heroine's Chinese restaurant. It's Lee to the rescue of the damsel in distress. - [Announcer] Lee (speaking quickly). - [Narrator] Portraying a European champion hired by the mafia, Bob Wall faced off against Lee again with the same result. A Korean martial artist portraying a Japanese karate champion also took on Lee. But the most famous duel appeared at the film's climax when Lee dukes it out with another hired thug played by American karate champion Chuck Norris. (dramatic music) (yelling) (groaning) Many consider it the classic martial arts battle on film, marked with Lee's impish humor. (gentle music) Between films, Lee worked on his book, describing his martial arts philosophy. (gentle music) He began filming Game of Death, even though there was only a rough outline of a plot and no script. Friends disapproved of the title, for death is considered too unlucky a word to be used in the name of any project. Lee tempted fate in other ways, picking a house with an unlucky layout, according to practitioners of feng shui. His nickname Little Dragon also was considered unlucky, but Lee had little patience with superstition. However, the toll of constant work began to tell on Lee. Production was haphazard, with no clear script. (dramatic music) (tires squealing) (booming) Basketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar visited Lee on the set and Lee improvised a fight scene between himself and his student friend. This sequence would later become a major selling point in the finished film, although it does not show Lee at his best. The leisurely production of Game of Death was interrupted when Hollywood came calling, interested in casting Lee in a major martial arts movie. Although tailor made for Bruce Lee, (yelling) Warner Brothers Studio added on two more good guys in the script. (gentle music) The Blaxploitation craze helped Lee to the casting of karate champion Jim Kelly - [Han] Your style is unorthodox. It is not the art, but the combat that you enjoy. - The winning. - [Narrator] Veteran actor John Saxon was also cast because producers still weren't sure whether the movie would succeed without a Caucasian star. - There's a point I won't go beyond. (dramatic music) - [Announcer] Now he must face the hands of death. (gentle music) - [Narrator] Compared to the small budget usually associated with kung fu films, the flamboyant production values of Enter the Dragon quickly made it the Rolls Royce of martial arts movies. Even so, the script was constantly being revised and rewritten and the production was so troubled that few thought it would ever see a theater. The international cast and crew suffered the curse of Babel as translators were needed to get instructions among the several languages spoken on the set. At the center of the plot was the bad guy, the drug lord Han, part James Bond supervillain, part Fu Manchu. Lee played a kung fu teacher recruited by British intelligence to infiltrate the drug lord's fortress by entering a martial arts competition on his island lair. The competition is merely a facade for Han's recruitment of henchmen to serve his international drug ring. Hong Kong star Angela Mao played Lee's sister who dies rather than submit to the villain's henchman, played by Bob Wall. Wall had been the Russian boxer Lee defeated in The Chinese Connection, the European champion in Way of the Dragon, and Lee again defeated him in Enter the Dragon, avenging his sister's death. - [Announcer] On a mysterious island in the South China Sea (dramatic music) there is a fortress without walls (dramatic music) protected by an invincible army that needs no ordinary weapons. (gong banging) Welcome to the island of Han. - I gather you still don't have enough to bust up his operation. - We know everything, we can prove nothing. (groovy music) We want you to go in there as our agent. - [Announcer] His job was to get them out alive. (funky music) (dramatic music) - [Narrator] The demands on Lee as both star and fight choreographer wore him out and he lost several pounds from his already wiry frame. During the shooting of a fight sequence, Wall accidentally injured Lee's hand with a broken bottle, requiring 12 stitches to close the wound. Chinese crewmen and extras harangued Bruce, trying to goad him into killing Wall to preserve his honor. It added another pressure on the overexerted star who was still feuding with Warner Brothers about the film's title. The studio wanted to call it Han's Island, as they thought his title, Enter the Dragon, would not sell tickets as it was too Chinese. Lee finally won the argument. One of the most difficult scenes to shoot was the fight sequence in the hall of mirrors, a dazzling display of fighting, but a nightmare to shoot without seeing either lights or cameras. - [Announcer] The inscrutable Han. (glass breaking) (glass breaking) (yelling) - [Narrator] Another problem was that Lee's kicks were so fast they did not register unless the cameras were speeded up to slow the action enough to be caught on film. For Lee, slowing down his kicks was not an option. (dramatic music) (yelling) - [Announcer] Fury is back. Part man. (yelling) Part myth, part magic. (yelling) And pure mayhem. (dramatic music) - [Narrator] He was always driving toward perfection, striving for greater success, and pushing himself beyond the limit of physical endurance. But Bruce was injured many times during the grueling production schedule including several severe blows to the head. Worn out and wracked with pain, Bruce completed filming and took a well deserved rest, but not for long. (dramatic music) Still exhausted from making Enter the Dragon, he began planning to resume filming Game of Death, which he hoped would be the ultimate kung fu movie. Meanwhile as the troubled production wrapped on Enter the Dragon, producers weren't sure what the result would be. Enter the Dragon had cost half a million dollars to make and at last count yielded more than $150 million. The spectacular success of Enter the Dragon guaranteed Lee worldwide movie superstar status. It seemed he would go on writing, directing, and starring in more movies, ever polishing his craft. Lee had hoped he would finally achieve his personal goals of introducing martial arts to a worldwide audience and becoming the first Asian international superstar. Both goals were reached, but sadly, he would not see it happen. Lee did not live to see his magnum opus reach the screen. On July 20th, 1973, just before he was scheduled to return to the United States for the premiere of Enter the Dragon, Lee had resumed work on Game of Death. While discussing script changes with producer Raymond Chow, Bruce complained of a headache and went to lie down. After Bruce failed to meet Chow for dinner, the producer returned to check on Lee but found he could not wake him. Lee was rushed to the hospital but he died without regaining consciousness. (somber music) He was only 32 years old. Enter the Dragon went into theaters as the world mourned the loss of the new megastar. The international success of the movie only heightened the loss. Soon after his death, rumors abounded that Lee had been murdered, poisoned, like the master in The Chinese Connection. Rumors also circulated that he had been ambushed by a mob and beaten to death. Or shot by gangsters determined to prove that although he was an invincible fighter in hand to hand combat, he was vulnerable to a bullet. Or that a fighting technique like that called the iron fist, or the vibrating fist, delivered by a jealous rival during filming of Enter the Dragon caused a subtle injury which slowly killed him. Marijuana and other drugs were mentioned in tabloid newspapers, which also harped on the fact he died in the bed of a glamorous actress. In Asia it was said that Lee had courted misfortune by starting the movie Game of Death, death being an unlucky word to have in a movie title. The medical explanation is that Lee had taken painkillers to relieve the suffering caused by injuries he sustained during his last film. An allergic reaction to the painkillers produced a cerebral edema that killed him. (dramatic music) With Enter the Dragon and other Bruce Lee movies raking in money, Hollywood looked around for another martial artist to replace Lee as kung fu movie king. Sonny Chiba of Japan was pitched as a possible successor in such movies as The Bodyguard. (tires squealing) - [Men] Chiba, Chiba, Chiba. (yelling) Chiba, Chiba, Chiba, Chiba. (groaning) Chiba, Chiba, Chiba, Chiba. - [Narrator] Bruce Lee's co-star in Enter the Dragon, Jim Kelly, pursued a career in martial arts Blaxploitation films such as Black Belt Jones. - [Announcer] Jim Dragon Kelly. He clobbers the mob as Black Belt Jones. (yelling) - [Narrator] One of the most successful Hollywood martial artists was Chuck Norris, Bruce Lee's opponent at the climax of The Way of the Dragon. Already the owner of a chain of martial arts schools and a teacher to the stars, Norris quickly expanded into appearing in action and adventure films. (exciting music) (cheering in audience) He became one of Hollywood's leading action stars. Other martial artists also made the break in the cinema stardom. - [Announcer] Jason has a dream. - [Jason] Someday I'm gonna be just like him. - [Narrator] Steven Seagal played a grim warrior in a number of action films including Above the Law. (dramatic music) - [Announcer] He's a cop. - Stop the car! (tires squealing) - [Announcer] With an attitude. (glass breaking) (yelling) - You just made number four on the Most Wanted list. (glass breaking) - I wanna be number one. - [Narrator] But the dour Seagal lacked the personal appeal that endeared Lee to his many fans. Jean-Claude Van Damme did not have Lee's onscreen personality but he did have an incomprehensible accent. - [Announcer] A brutal gang is reshaping the world (yelling) into their own vision of Hell and only one man can stop them. Jean-Claude Van Damme is leading the battle between good and evil. (dramatic flute music) Cyborg. - You're good. - I can do better. - Like Norris, he appeared in other films as the villain before breaking through to hero roles. In the wake of Lee's death, filmmakers searched for new martial artists to take over his position as action superstar. Hong Kong was especially reluctant to let go of its superstar who had represented so much pride to Asians in general, and the people of Hong Kong in particular. (somber music) An embarrassing parade of Bruce lookalikes not only took over Lee's roles but his name, or various respellings of it anyway. (funky music) - [Announcer] A supernatural action American movie starring Bruce Lea. The dragon never died, he was just waiting for the moment he could return from the grave to seek revenge. - [Narrator] Bruce Lee Fights Back from the Grave was downright morbid with a Lee imitator portraying Bruce rising from the grave to seek vengeance on his murderers. Exit the Dragon, Enter the Tiger had an imitator playing both Bruce and a lookalike investigating his mysterious death. - [Announcer] Li enters the sinister Hong Kong underworld on a fantastic mission of vengeance. There he is met by a deadly force willing to do anything to achieve success. (funky dramatic music) (yelling) (yelling) (yelling) The tiger explodes in a fury of vengeance as he rips apart an amazing and ruthless conspiracy. A film that exposes the truth about one of the most shocking deaths of our time. Bruce Li in Exit the Dragon, Enter the Tiger. - [Narrator] Yet none of these imposters could match the original in talent or ability. Inevitably, the legend of Bruce Lee would be the subject of parody. Enter the Dragon was lampooned in a segment of Kentucky Fried Movie. (yelling) - [Man] Of course there are occasional moments of comic relief. (dramatic music) - Chinese boy's gotta sun him out. - [Narrator] Bruce Lee imitators were mocked in The Call Me Bruce. (funky music) - [Announcer] He walked like him. He talked like him. - Give me five, yo mama, get down. (laughing) - [Announcer] He even cooked like him. (yelling) His days became filled with new challenges. (upbeat music) (yelling) Eating chicken with nunchucks. Defeating criminals with a flick of his hand. And defending good against evil. - Hey, give that man his purse back. They call me Bruce. - Hi Bruce. - [All] Bruce! - [Announcer] They Call Me Bruce, a superhero American can believe in. - [Narrator] However among all the Bruce wannabes, one promising performer who had appeared as a stuntman in The Chinese Connection and Enter the Dragon seemed to match Lee's personal appeal and athletic ability. Soon, he found himself being touted as the successor of Bruce Lee. - [Kid] Hey Jackie, come on! - In a minute! - [Kid] It's time! (gentle dramatic music) - [Narrator] But owing more to Buster Keaton than Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan found his own niche performing action films laced with his own particular brand of martial arts humor. - [Announcer] Jackie Chan. (playful music) (yelling) (speaking in foreign language) (applauding) (yelling) (swords clanking) (yelling) (epic music) - [Narrator] A former performer in Chinese opera, Chan starred in dozens of Hong Kong movies and a few American films. His breakthrough to international stardom came as the result of his own blend of amazing athletic ability mixed with slapstick comedy. (playful music) (gentle music) But there was another heir to the throne with an even closer connection to Bruce Lee. When Brandon Lee, Bruce's son, came of age, he followed his father's example, pursuing an acting career in martial arts films. He appeared in movies in both Hollywood and Hong Kong. (exciting action music) (yelling) Like his father, Brandon was also gaining fame and fans when death struck again. During the filming of The Crow, Brandon was accidentally killed when a prop gun aimed at him turned out to be loaded with a real bullet. The tragedy added fuel to the speculation that the Lee family suffered from a curse or that other sinister forces influenced the death of the two stars. (blues music) Brandon is buried alongside his father in Seattle. Bruce Lee's death haunted moviegoers, for like his son Brandon and also James Dean, his movies continued to be released into theaters after his death, highlighting the loss of the rising star. (dramatic music) Enter the Dragon went into mass release following the death of Lee, gaining the dead star legions of new fans, demanding more Bruce Lee movies. The already completed The Way of the Dragon went into theaters the following year. It was retitled the Return of the Dragon, falsely implying it was a sequel to Enter the Dragon. Episodes of The Green Hornet were recut and rearranged, going onto the big screen as Kato and the Green Hornet. Even Marlowe was re-released to capitalize on the Bruce Lee phenomenon, with Lee receiving top billing over star James Garner. Years after his death, Lee reappeared in theaters. - [Announcer] Plans for the Last Game of Death, ended suddenly with Bruce Lee's tragic death. Now through the miracle of motion pictures, we bring you and the story and the film that Bruce Lee wanted you to see as he intended his millions of fans the world over. (yelling) Goodbye, Bruce Lee, His Last Game of Death. (dramatic music) Game of Death, the movie he had been haphazardly filming at the time of demise was eventually pieced together.
