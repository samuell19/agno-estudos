Portia! You didn't call me all summer. I know, I know. My parents surprised me with a trip to Europe. Europe? What is this, 2005? Right! What about you? We spent all of August in the Maldives. The Maldives? Yeah, it's like Thailand before Thailand became so trendy. Tell me about it. There's, like, nowhere where you can just relax anymore. Seriously! I know that look. What look? The one that says "I can't believe I agreed to another year." Don't complain. It could be a lot worse. I suppose, and hey, I just saw your better half. He was greeting families in the parking lot. Of course he is. It was hard to tell who found him more charming, the girls or their mothers. Marie! I'm just saying. You might have competition from two generations of Clark women. Miss Barton! Just keep smiling and remember, it's only nine months until summer vacation. Right. Janie! Welcome back. Thanks. You remember my mother. Of course, Mrs. Wade. I'm Rebecca Barton. Janie's creative writing teacher. I hope I won't be seeing that lecherous math teacher around this year. The one who gave Jane a B. She means Mr. Barnes. He gave me a B last year. Which I obviously didn't deserve. So, my mother called Mrs. Caldwell and to her. I'll see you later, Miss. Barton. Bye, Mom. Bye. I trust that the Ivies will be better represented at this year's college recruitment fair this year, miss? Barton, but please, call me Rebecca. Well, this is the year that Janie needs to decide upon a school, and I don't want her wasting any of her time with the state colleges. Of course. Good. So, you found her? Of course. She's in Whitley, and you'll never guess who she's rooming with. Grace. They put all the losers together. And the paupers. And you got the stuff? Greetings staff and students at Clark Academy. It is my distinct pleasure to welcome you to one of the finest academic institutions in the nation, where the young ladies of today are molded into the leaders of tomorrow. Some of you may have spent many of your formative years at Clark, while for others, this will be your inaugural semester. I wish all of you the very best this coming year and I look forward to meeting each and every one of you. You remember these three words, and you shall never go astray. Honesty. Truth. Integrity. Knock, knock. Are you Elena Johns? Yeah. I am. Who are you guys? Just Clark Academy's friendly welcoming committee. Okay. Well, come on in. We can see that you're really busy, but we just wanted to give you this. Candy? You do eat candy, don't you? Yeah, you don't have, like, one of those eating disorders or anything? Or like, one of those weird allergies? No, no, it's just, um... Thank you. Thanks. Go ahead, open it. Welcome to Clark! Janie! We were just messing around. You were just nothing. Here, take this. Get rid of it. We will talk about this later, Janie! This is not over! I'm sorry. This isn't how I wanted us too meet. It's okay. I guess hazing is part of the Clark tradition. No. No, it's not, and I assure you, there will be consequences for those girls. Are you Headmistress Caldwell? No, no. Hardly. I'm Miss Barton. You're the creative writing teacher. Yeah. I'm really looking forward to your class. Great. Well, I hope you'll enjoy it, and I also hope that you'll find that you can talk to me about anything. Thank you. I was also a student here at Clark, just like you. So, I wanted to see how you were getting acclimated. Just like me? You mean a scholarship student? You say that like you it's a bad thing. Well, I kinda get the impression that we're not exactly welcomed with open arms around here. Hey. Can I sit? I going to tell you something and I want you to really listen to me. Most of the girls here at Clark are here because their parents want what's best for them and because they can afford the tuition, and there's nothing wrong with that, but girls like you and I, we had to earn our way in through hard work and perseverance. Now this doesn't make us any better than anyone else, but it certainly doesn't make us any less deserving. Don't ever let anyone tell you that you don't belong here. You do. You belong here as much as anyone else. Got it? Yeah. Great. Now, let's get you moved in! It's only the first day but already I want to bust out the wine. That makes two of us. Really? That doesn't sound like you. Are you kidding? If I didn't have dorm duty tonight I would be all about the wine. What's really bothering you? Is it just me or every year do the girls get, I don't know, meaner? I don't know if you've forgotten, but they were pretty darn mean when we went here, too. Don't you remember what we did to Carly Olsen with those laxatives? That was me! Yeah. Okay, what punishment did you give them for what they did to that new girl? Well, I only caught Janie, the other two got away, but we all know Janie was the mastermind. If that girl doesn't become a politician, I will give you my Christmas bonus. We don't get Christmas bonuses. Still. So, what'd you make her do? I had her write an essay on kindness. Good. Serves her right. She'll probably just pay someone to write it for her. Well, we say we're preparing girls for the real world, and in the real world, there is nothing to stop girls like Janie Wade from paying other people to do their work. Sad, but true. Hey, you don't need to be a guardian angel for every new scholarship student. You know that, right? It's not fair to them. It's not fair to you either. So, you two got pretty serious over the summer? No. We only saw each other... every day. Ooh. Stop it. Well, who could blame you? He's quite the catch. Yeah, you know. He's, um... My God. Jason! You almost gave me a heart attack! That is my cue to leave. Take care of my girl. You don't have to worry about that. Bye, Marie. I'll see you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Drive safe. What are you doing, sneaking around the house? I prefer slinking to sneaking. It has a more dignified air. Does it? You're the one who teaches creative writing. I'm just an ordinary old English teacher. It's true. I missed you. I missed you, too. I was getting used to waking up every morning with you next to me. I told you I'm on dorm duty tonight. I know. All I said was I missed you. You know, there's no rule about me staying here at your place. Except there is. Right, but nobody said we have to follow it. I like my job, thank you. Besides, you really should not be here. If Mrs. Caldwell sees you, she'll have a conniption. Relax, I'll tell her we're reviewing my lesson plan for the week. She knows you're not that dedicated. So, dorm duty. It's all week? And then I'm all yours. No, really. You should go before somebody really does see you. "Parting is such sweet sorrow that I shall say goodnight 'til it be morrow." Romeo and Juliet. That was too easy. Now, when most of you hear the word sodium, I know the first thing that comes to mind is table salt. That nefarious little mineral that makes your food taste great but leaves you feeling bloated. Mind if I join you? Sodium is the safest... Thanks. I was starting to think whatever I had was contagious. Don't feel bad. There's a reason that "friendliness" isn't a part of the Clark Academy seal. Grace Walker. Elena Johns. I know, and I like your style. No, I'm serious. I've seen your stuff. Your clothes. Very cool. I'm your roommate. I just dropped my stuff off quick and came straight here. My parents couldn't get me here yesterday, but no biggie. I know the deal. I've been going here since I was old enough to read. I have really been looking forward to meeting you though. I'm really glad you're here now. The first night was kind of lonely. Yeah, sorry about that. But not to worry, you're in good hands now. It's no accident. It's why they put us together. They like to bunk me with the new girls so I can show them the ropes. Did I miss anything else? Proper safety procedures so no one gets hurt. There's a chemical reaction for you, Two losers attracted to each other. Ladies, do any of you have anything you want to add? No, ma'am. As I was saying before I was interrupted. Alkali metals in general are highly reactive. I feel bad about our housewarming gift. I don't think it was festive enough. I think we should have planned something a little more explosive. Sodium is a highly reactive... My goodness. What's going on over there? Girls, are you okay? I'm fine. I'm fine. It's-it's just a tiny cut. The glass just nicked me. Miss Johns, I know you're new to Clark, but this is exactly why I spent the better part of class - going over... - Janie did it! What do you mean, Grace? I'm sitting all the way over here. I'm sorry, it's my fault. I know that you said be careful, but I must have accidentally got a little bit water on the sodium. Well, this is a good lesson for everyone, I guess. Let's just get you cleaned up. Okay. I would have killed her if I were you. Trust me, I've dealt with a lot worse than Janie Wade. She's just some spoiled little rich girl. Once you show them that they can't get to you, they just move on to someone else. Well, you have a lot more self-control than I do. Janie's been a bitch for forever, and those two sidekicks of hers have half a brain between the two of them. So, how do you usually handle her? Clark is a small school. When you've been together with the same people for as long as we have, you learn to live with them, even if you don't like them. Plus, Janie and I have a history. Ooh, juicy? Hardly, but before high school we used to be friends. Best friends, actually. So, what happened? People change. Come on. It has to be something more than that. I mean, she's awful! Look, this is Clark. All the girls here are screwed up to some degree. We all just deal with it in different ways. I guess Janie figured that the best way to feel better about herself was to tear other people down. That's still no excuse. No, it's not, but as crazy as this sounds, I sometimes feel sorry for her. She's nasty, but she's not stupid. And every time she looks at me, I think... I think she realizes how pathetic she is. So, how is it that you're only here for a year? Most girls that come here for high school start as freshmen. I won a writing contest. First prize, a one-year scholarship to one of the finest schools money can buy. Honestly, the last thing that I wanted was to transfer my senior year, but my mom said that graduating from Clark, even if I only came for one year, would be really good for colleges. It's true, or at least that's what they say. Apparently having the old Clark Academy seal on your transcript is a surefire way for colleges to fork over some money. But I guess that's another reason they stuck us together. Why is that? Scholarship kids. I think they're afraid we'll contaminate the beautiful people. Wait. You're on scholarship too? I have been since the very beginning. The local women's club in my hometown chose me. So, if I don't hold up my end of the bargain, it's not just my parents I have to own up to, I have a whole town. That must be a lot of pressure. Whatever. I deal. Wow. That's... that's beautiful. I want you to have it. No. Elena, thank you, but I could never accept this. Please. Please, it would mean so much to me. I have another one just like it. Yeah, I can... I'll wear it, I guess. There. Just like sisters. I'm so glad we're getting off campus for dinner tonight. Well, let's hope this sushi restaurant is all you can eat. I know how much you love your California rolls. They're healthy. Really? By the dozen? Hey, do you remember what they served us when we went here? All those starches and fried foods. They should have kept a cardiologist on staff. Right? I think they thought it was good for us. Kind of like the sun and antibacterial s... My God. My God. Who could have done this? I know exactly who. Janie? Who else would it be? No. Janie Wade is a bully, not a criminal. Do you really think she could have done something like this? Yeah, I do. My God. I hope you have a good explanation for this, Miss Wade. I already told you, I had nothing to do with this. Janie, do you really expect us to believe that? Tell us the truth and this will be a lot easier on you. I am! Then how do you explain your ID being found at the scene, directly under Miss Barton's car? Like I already I told you. I lost my ID. I have no idea how it got there. Why the hell would I do something like this? To get back at me for making you write that essay. Do you really think I'm dumb enough to do that? I'd be the first person you'd suspect. I think we've heard enough, Miss Wade. You're dismissed. Miss Barton and I will discuss your punishment and inform you later. Punishment? This is absolutely ridiculous! I'm innocent until proven guilty! That will do, Miss Wade. Well, what do you think? There's no proof, Rebecca. It's all circumstantial. You must realize that. Mrs. Caldwell, who else would it be? That's not good enough, I'm afraid. What kind of message would we be sending to the students if we can't even give them the benefit of the doubt? This wouldn't have anything to do with who Janie's mother is, would it? Since I know you're upset, I'll pretend I didn't just hear that. Okay, class. So, I realize that you had all summer to read Bleak House, but because I'm guessing that most of you didn't even start reading it until last week, it should be very fresh in your minds. One of the interesting aspects of this novel is that unlike Oliver Twist or Great Expectations, which we've read in previous years, Bleak House doesn't have a traditional villain. Its characters are incredibly nuanced. Yes, Lily? What about Lady Dedlock? She had an affair and gave away the baby. So, because she had sex and gave her baby up for adoption she's a villain? No, but she clearly knew the consequences of... Besides, she didn't give her baby away. He sister told her it was dead! Are you going to let me finish? Okay, whoa, whoa. Ladies, ladies. Love the passion, but remember what we said about respectful debate. Also remember how we cautioned against looking at the past through the prism of the present. In Victorian England it was quite a scandal to have a child out of wedlock. It was considered one of the most shameful... Freak. Okay, just sit tight class... Mr. Lewis? I can go check on Elena if you'd like? Yes. Please. Thank you, Janie. Right. Okay, so, everybody open your books to 133. That was quite a stunt you pulled back there. You may have everyone else fooled, but not me. Just leave me alone, Janie. You know, I was wondering. Did you think that since you took the blame in science lab that you could become part of my group? You couldn't pay me to be a part of your pathetic group. I know you're the one who vandalized Miss Barton's car. Why would I do that? To frame me. Prove it. I can't. You know that. But what I'd love to know is how you a hold of my ID. Janie. Look, it's that obvious that you're the queen bee at this school. But Clark is really just a sheltered little playground for privileged girls who live sheltered little lives. You've never been in the real world. You wouldn't have the faintest idea how to take care of yourself if you didn't have people doing everything for you. But I promise you, if you ever cross me again, if you so much as look at me or Grace, you will wish that you were never born, and if you think I'm joking... just go ahead and try me. I can't believe some of the girls actually complain about the food here. Yeah, well, when your parents pay a small fortune for tuition, you think you're entitled to the very best. That's why some of them sneak out into town for the restaurants. Yeah, I guess. My very first year here, when I told my parents about what they were serving us for dinner, my father actually said he considered taking a maintenance job just for the food and I still don't think he was joking. Your parents, what are they like? Normal, I guess. Well, compared to the rest of the girls. We were blue collar, but it's not like I ever had to worry about money or anything. My dad is a lineman for the electric company and my mom works part-time at the county hospital. What about yours? You know the other day, when we were talking about colleges? Um, I know I said, "My mom," but actually, she's my foster mom. Yeah. I've been with her and my foster dad for about two years now, and that's the longest I've ever been with a foster family, so. Geez, Elena. I'm sorry. Whatever. A lot of kids have it a lot worse. Besides, if it wasn't for my foster parents, I wouldn't be here. Elena, I heard about what happened in your class today. Yeah. What was that about? I don't really want to talk about it. Elena, come on. You can tell me anything. I don't want to talk about it, okay? Okay. Yeah, I get it. Elena? What are you... Are you okay? I, um... I hope that it's okay I'm here. Yeah, sure. I just don't always have students come by unannounced at this hour, but... I'm sorry. But you said if I ever needed anything. Yes, of course. Come on in. Wow, this is amazing. Do all of the teachers' houses look like this? Just the ones that live on campus. There's some really great homes on the premises. But I got lucky. It goes by seniority, and since I went to Clark, well, I got first dibs. Come on in. So, why don't you tell me what's bothering you. I, um... I think I made a huge mistake coming here. Elena, it's only been a few days. I know. And it's just... I don't fit in. I didn't feel like I fit in either when I first came to Clark. But after a while, I got used to it. Fell in love with it, actually. And now it feels like home. This will never be home for me. Not that I would know. What do you mean? Elena, remember, you can tell me anything. Um... The family that I'm currently living with... the ones that encouraged my writing, and convinced me to come here. I've only been living with them for two years. I'm a foster kid. Probably been with a dozen families that I can remember. I had no idea. How could you? No, I just... Of course I couldn't. I just mean I'm really sorry. Why don't you tell me the things that you do like about Clark and we'll go from there? One thing. Well, I love English. I always have. Except I humiliated myself in class today. I had a panic attack and ran out. Really? You didn't hear? No. I'm sure it wasn't nearly as bad as you imagine. And I probably shouldn't tell you this, but compared to the issues some of your classmates have, a panic attack is relatively minor. Thanks. I know you've got your course work, but if you ever want to raid my library, have at it. Really? Yeah. A few of them are mine, but most of them belong to the school. Passed down over the years. You're not going to find the latest best-sellers, but we pretty much have all of the classics. Thank you. Do you want some tea? I was just about to make some before you got here. Sure. While I go brew it, why don't you have a look and see what you'd like to borrow? Okay. I wasn't sure if you wanted any honey. Elena? Elena? Elena? Hey, you okay? Elena, what is it? What's wrong? Just leave me alone! I just wanted to see... I'm fine! I'm fine! Here. What do you think you're doing, you nosey little bitch? Whoa! You need to calm down. Grace? What the hell is she doing out past curfew? Should we scare her? No! We don't do anything! Just stay here. I feel like I owe you a huge apology. What? For last night. I can't tell you how sorry I am. I was up half the night thinking about it. Yeah, well... You must think I'm completely out of my mind. Elena, what happened to you? You didn't seem like yourself. You're really freaking me out. I know. I could try to explain it to you, but. I'm afraid it wouldn't really make much sense. You know how hard it's been for me since I started here, and last night, everything just kind of came to a head and, I don't know, I snapped. But you weren't even with us at the evening activity. I had no idea where you were. I know, I know. I really just needed some time alone. I felt so trapped. Claustrophobic. I felt like everyone was watching me and just judging. Why didn't you come talk to me? I could have helped you. I should have. Hey, let's go get some breakfast. You'll feel better. Actually, I'm not... I'm not feeling that well. I think I had a little too much dessert at dinner last night. Why don't you head over to the cafeteria and I'll get ready for class, and then I'll meet you there? Okay. Hey, Grace? I really am sorry. It's okay. Actually, she's my foster mom. What do you think you're doing? See you tomorrow. Elena. Elena, can I speak to you for a minute, please? What happened to you last night? I was worried. You just ran off. I know. I know. I'm so sorry about that. I just, I wasn't feeling well at all. Well, don't worry about it. I actually wanted to talk to you about something else. Okay. I reviewed your first writing assignment. And frankly, I was blown away. Really? Yes. Elena, you are immensely talented, and I would hate to see that talent squandered. You've heard about our college recruitment fair? Yeah. Yeah. I've heard some of the other girls mention it. Well, we're fortunate to have representatives from some of the most prestigious schools in the country, and I just happen to know the attendee from Webster College personally. Webster? They have one of the best creative writing programs in the county. Yes, they do. Someone's been doing her homework. It was the guidance counselor at my last high school, she put it on a short list of colleges she thought I should check out. Great. Well, with your permission, I would love to send it to her ahead of time. Really? You'd do that for me? Of course, why wouldn't I? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Of course. Great work. Where's your little friend, Gracie? Yeah, where's your girlfriend? Leave her alone, Janie. I'm warning you. Really? And what are you going to do about it? I'm not going to do anything about it, okay? I'm telling you for your sake. She's not like us, Janie, okay? You don't know you're doing. She's not... She's not right. Yeah, walk away, you loser! Loser. I made your favorite! Lasagna. Just needs a few more minutes in the oven. You okay? Yeah. I'm just having a little harder time than usual getting into the flow of things. Yeah. Well, that's hardly a surprise. It isn't easy to leave our summer schedule behind. True. And just everything that's been happening, my car. Yeah, I'm sorry about that. How about you? Same old, same old. Any students that stand out? Ones that show particular promise? Um, I can't tell. We just started discussing their summer reading. You? Yes. Elena Johns. She's the new student in senior year. She's the one who ran out of my class. Yeah. She's insanely talented. I've only read a little bit of her writing, but I've never seen a student be able to express themselves like this. I just hope she can handle her issues. Well, it's not like our greatest authors were paragons of normalcy. Plath was a manic depressive. Salinger was a recluse. Probably had agoraphobia. Hemingway was an alcoholic. Burroughs was a heroin addict. Okay, okay. I get the picture. It's just, I can sympathize with her. She kind of reminds me of myself, actually. Well, if there's one thing I know, you'll get the best out of her. Let's hope so. That's the lasagna. Are you going somewhere? I'm changing rooms. Wait, why? I just think it would be best for the both of us. I... I don't understand. I never felt closer to anyone in my life. We just met in September. That doesn't matter. What about our bond? Our bond? Come on, Grace. You can't tell me you didn't feel it too. We were put together for a reason. We were meant to be together. We were put together because they like to pair first year students with ones who have been going here for years to make the transition easier. I told you that. Is this about how I acted the other night? Because I already apologized for that. No, it's not, but honestly, Elena, that didn't help, okay? I just think it would be nice to have a fresh start. That's all. Come on, okay? There must be some reason. Can't we just... Can we talk about this? Please. Who's Claire Bigelow? Where did you hear that name? It was on that ID card that fell out of your purse. And then I... Why? What's the big deal? She was just a girl I used to know. It's nothing. Look, going to go take a shower. We can talk some more when I get back if you want. Okay. There are no words to adequately express how sorry we are, Mrs. Walker. Grace was such an important part of our family, and she'll leave a hole in our hearts that will never be filled. I heard the police have been by? They were, as a matter of policy, and they concur with what we originally thought. This was a tragic accident. Of course, I realize that doesn't make it any less devastating. Well, she... she... She had her whole life ahead of her. Whenever you're ready, I know the girls would like to do something to remember her. A kind of memorial. As you know, she was well-liked at Clark. Thank you. Here, I thought you'd want to have this. What is this? Grace's necklace. I assumed it had some sentimental meaning. This isn't hers. We found it with her things, so... Grace never had anything like that. I would have noticed something so unique. If it's okay, I'd like to see her room now. Of course. I'll take you. Thank you. Come in. Miss Johns. How are you? Was that Grace's mother I just saw leaving with Miss Barton? I'm afraid so. This must be very hard for you. I've had people close to me die before. As have I. That doesn't make it any easier. Is there something you wanted to talk to me about, Miss Johns? I was wondering. Did you happen to know why Grace requested to change rooms? Even if I did, it wouldn't be appropriate to share with you, but I don't. Do you mind telling me why you're asking? Because I think I might know the answer. Really? Maybe. Well, I'm listening, Miss Johns. Anything that I say in here is confidential, right? Of course. Because Miss Barton has been so good to me, and I would hate to do anything to upset her. I can't imagine how it would. Before Grace died, she told me something. She had a secret. A secret that she was keeping just to herself, and I... I told her, I begged her, to come to you about it. I think you better tell me everything you know. Do you think we should have cancelled this? No way. Look how happy they all look. Yeah, but, you don't think it feels, I don't know, disrespectful? I think it's exactly what the girls need. And actually, I think it's exactly what Grace would have wanted us to do. Yeah, you're probably right. Rebecca, I don't mean to sound insensitive, but as awful as what happened is, life goes on, and the quicker we can get back to normal, the better it will be for everyone. I know, I know. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to play matchmaker. Elena! Hey. How are you doing? Okay, I guess. All things considered. Yeah. Do you think... I think Grace would have wanted it to go on. Are you ready? For what? There's someone I'd like to introduce you to. Yeah. Ms. Dobbs. Rebecca! Hey. How you doing? You okay? Martha Dobbs, I'd like to introduce you to my student, Elena Johns. It's a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Dobbs. Please! Call me Martha. At Webster, we may take our work very seriously. Formalities, well, not at all. Well, I don't think that'll be a concern for me. Why not? I'm not exactly Webster material. Well, I read your essay, which my dear friend was kind enough to send me, and I would happen to disagree. Of course, I can't make any promises, as I'm not in admissions, but I do know talent when I see it, and you, my dear, have talent in spades. See? There's nothing wrong with having confidence. Will you two excuse me? Of course. I'll catch up with you later. Like I said, I am not in admissions. However, I'm not going to downplay my influence. Especially when, as you know, our creative writing program is regularly ranked as the best in the country. Now, if you're really serious about Webster I would love for... Excuse me. There must be some mistake. None of this makes any sense. You don't know him like I do. I saw the photos, Miss Barton. Photos can be faked. They can be altered. Rebecca, please. Don't be one of those naive women. There's no mistake. It was Grace in those photos and in some of them... Jason would never do anything like this. I never thought so either. Mr. Lewis has always been one of our most respected teachers. But... What? Tell me! What were you going to say? Someone voiced a concern to me before these photos were found. That's ridiculous. I didn't say I believed it. I said it was a suggestion. But before I could determine its veracity, I was contacted by the police. How did the police even know about these photos? An anonymous tip. Obviously, where minors are concerned, they need to act with a preponderance of caution. I'm sorry. I don't relish telling you this. So, where is he now? In jail. Probably until his hearing. Can I see him? That's up to you and to the authorities, but... What? After you do, I think it would be best if you kept your distance from Clark Academy. Excuse me? I know your parents live in town. Go stay with them for a while. You've been through a lot this past week. It will do you some good. Are you telling me I'm fired? Right now, I'm telling you to take a voluntary leave of absence. I can't believe you're doing this to me? I'm not doing anything to you, Miss Barton. But my responsibility is to the students. Not to myself and not to you. Your relationship with Mr. Lewis was well known. Now, nobody is accusing you of anything, but until all of this is straightened out, we think it would be for the best. Rebecca! Hey! What'd she say? She doesn't know what the hell she's talking about. You know, this is what I get for being loyal. Well, what'd she say? Bunch of lies, that's all. Hey, Rebecca, slow down! Slow down a minute. Okay, tell me what happened. What did she say? She told me to take a leave of absence. She fired you? She might as well have. She suggested I go stay at my parents' house while they complete their investigation. Well, that's not so bad. Aren't they in Arizona still until the winter? At least you'll have the place to yourself. That's not the point. The point is she thinks I'm guilty. You need to talk to Elena. Maybe Grace said something to her. There has to be another explanation for all this. She told me not to talk to anyone. Said it wouldn't be appropriate. That I might compromise the investigation. Well, I'll see what I can find out. Thank you. You want me to come with you and help you get your stuff together? You know what? I think I just need to be alone right now. - Okay. - Thanks. Marie. You haven't heard anything, have you? Rumors? About Jason and students. God, no! Never! Okay? Okay. I'll call you. Janie. I need to talk to you. Come on in. What can I do for you? I heard about what happened. Is there anything this entire school doesn't know about? Well, maybe this. I'm listening. The day before Grace died she said something strange to me, and I don't know if it's important, but I just thought that I had to tell you because if it was important... Janie, what is it? Grace was walking across campus. I started teasing her. Just kidding around. Look, I know what everyone at this school thinks of me. Especially the teachers, and for the most part you're right, but this was just harmless fun, I swear. Something stupid about her probably hooking up with Elena. Stuff like that. Go on. Grace warned me about Elena. She told me to leave her alone. That there was something not right about her. Not right? What does that even mean? I don't know. So, why didn't you say anything sooner? What was I going to say? Plus, I've known Grace a long time. We actually used to be close. A lot closer than I am with anyone now. Look, if there's one thing that I knew about Grace, it's that she's tough, but when I saw her talking about Elena, I've never seen her look that way before. What way? Like she was scared. Really scared. Well, I appreciate you telling me this. Janie. You didn't vandalize my car, did you? Hello? Rebecca, it's Martha. Hi, Martha. I'm actually just driving right now. Would it be okay if I called back you later? This isn't a good time. This won't take but a minute. Sure, what is it? I'm afraid I have some unfortunate news. It seems that your prized student plagiarized most of her essay. What? No, that's not possible. There must be some mistake. Not unless her real name is Constance Davidson. The Pulitzer Prize-winning author? I was so impressed by her essay that I shared it with a colleague of mine. He thought some of it sounded familiar. Turns out, Elena lifted dozens of sentences, almost verbatim, from a book of Davidson's early essays. You're sure? Unless this is somehow the proverbial room of chimpanzees typing the collected works of Shakespeare, I'm afraid there's no question about it. Okay. Well, thanks for letting me know. I'm sorry, Rebecca. I know you must be disappointed. My God. Hello? Can I help you? Hi. I'm hoping you can. What'cha got? This necklace recently came into my possession. And you want to know if it was stolen. Exactly. I know that most pawn shops keep a log of items in case they turn up stolen. That's right. At the end of every business day, we have to submit a list of everything we bought to the local PD. Really nice craftsmanship. I feel like I remember this piece. Gimme a sec. Of course. Darn it. Not in the log? Nope. Wasn't stolen. Thanks, anyway. Wait. I got one more idea. - I do a lot of appraisals. - Right. Mind if I take another look at that necklace? Of course. Was it here... Yes, I remember this now. A woman brought it in to have it appraised. I actually almost bought it. Then she came back a couple of years later because it was missing. She seemed very upset, because she said it had tremendous sentimental value to her, and she couldn't find it. Maybe it got stolen after all. You wouldn't happen to have that lady's address, would you? I would love to return this to her. Right here. Glad she'll be getting it back. Let her know I'm still interested if she's, willing to sell! I will. Hey. Marie. Hi, I need a favor. Ask me anything. I need a picture of Elena. A picture? For what? Never mind. I'll tell you later. Can you do it? I don't know. Where am I going to get a picture from? It's going to look a little suspicious if I suddenly tell her I want a selfie. In her admissions file there's got to be a photo of her. With her application, at least. You owe me one. Obviously. Bye. Yes? Mrs. Shaw? Mrs. Helen Shaw? No solicitors, please. Sorry. No. I'm not a solicitor. My name is Rebecca Barton, and I have something that might belong to you. What is it? Come in. I never thought I'd see it again. It was special to you? It was a gift from my late husband. Can I ask how you came into possession of it? It... It disappeared a long time ago. Mrs. Shaw, would you happen to know a Grace Walker? No. No, I don't believe I do. Would you happen to know an Elena Johns? Elena? Yes, of course. You do know her? Yes. She was my foster daughter. Was? These are our children. Robert and I, he was my husband, we always wanted children of our own, but it was not meant to be. Over the years, we were foster parents to almost thirty children. And these are them? Every single one of our sons and daughters. After Robert passed, I couldn't manage fostering any more. And this is Elena. No. Sorry, you're mistaken. That's Claire Bigelow. This is Elena. They lived here at the same time. Are you sure this isn't Elena? That is most definitely Claire Bigelow and that is most definitely Elena Johns. Claire is a few years older in your photo, but I would recognize my foster children anywhere. Of course. Especially Claire. She was something else. You should have seen the way she and Robert butted heads. She was troubled? Troubled? No. A lot of the children, because of their history... it takes some time for them to adjust. So they act out. But in our eyes, as soon as we made the commitment to Claire, we were her parents. And with discipline, loving discipline, we eventually managed to get through to her. And then the accident. Mrs. Shaw? May I ask how your husband died? It was just one of those freak things. Robert was shaving. An electric razor. Trying to do everything too quickly, as usual. The razor slipped. It fell into the sink. It was still plugged in. The water was on. I was devastated. We all were. But no one more so than Claire. Why Claire? She was the one who found him. Marie? Rebecca, where are you? I just got back to my parents' place. Marie, I need you to listen. I want you to keep a close eye on Elena. Well, that's going to be pretty tough. Why? Elena is gone. What do you mean, gone? I mean gone. Missing. AWOL. Nobody has seen her all day. She didn't come to her first class, and when we went looking for her she was nowhere to be found. My God. The police have been called and everything. Mrs. Caldwell is completely freaking out. Marie, I gotta go. I'll explain later. Wait, Rebecca! - I'll call you later. - Hang on! Wait, what? My God. I don't believe it. Hello? Hello? Hello? Elena! What are you doing here? What? You're not happy to see me? No, it's just, um... How did you find me here? I followed you. It wasn't that hard. But why? I see you've been doing your research. Find what you're looking for? Elena, who are you? Haven't you guessed, mother? You really had no idea, did you? I guess not. So much for all those wives' tales about a mother being able to pick her child out of a crowded nursery. Something about a maternal bond. But then, ours was never particularly strong, was it? How did you find me? See, when you're a foster child you're forced to become resourceful, but it wasn't that hard. Those agencies say they keep the files confidential, and in theory they do, but it ain't Fort Knox. If you want them, you can get them. Elena, you have to believe me. I only did what I thought was best. I certainly believe that. You did what was best. For you. No, It wasn't like that. I was a teenager. I was so young. What kind of mother could I have been? But not a day went by that I didn't think about you. You have to believe that. I saw those photographs of you. In your photo album. Of your happy childhood. And then, in college with friends. Abroad. It certainly didn't look like you were thinking about the baby that you threw out like yesterday's trash. No. You want to know what I was doing when you were traipsing around the Southwest with your boyfriend? Let me think. It's so hard to keep it all straight. I had so many names. So many different families. If it was when I was with the Johnsons, I was probably hiding in and closet, just in case Mr. Johnson came home and decided to lay into me with a belt, or maybe it was when I was with Mr. and Mrs. Krebbs. They had so many foster kids that we each got one square meal a day and we had to steal the rest from the school cafeteria. I am so sorry, Elena. Don't be. I always got my revenge. You saw the articles. Accidents happen all the time. But I swear to you, I really swear, I never killed anyone who didn't deserve it. Grace? Did Grace deserve it? That one was hard. I'm not going to lie. But she started poking around where she shouldn't have, and I couldn't take chances, could I? What do you want from me now, Elena? I want you to feel the pain that I felt every day. Because I was a burden. An inconvenience. - No. - Something that had to just be thrown away. Elena, I only wanted what was best. You have to believe that. Please. Please, Elena. Where are you going, mother? Come on, Rebecca. There's no point in hiding. I just want to talk to you. Serves you right, bitch. You killed Grace! Janie, stop it! Elena. Elena, please! Elena, please. Please. Please, Elena. Elena, no! Please. Come here. Let me take the pain away. Let me make it go away. My whole life that is all I ever wanted. But now? Now it's too late. No, it's never too late. It's not too late. No! No! It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Help is on the way. I'm so sorry. You deserved better. You deserved so much better. You deserved so much better. Save your strength. I... forgive you. My daughter. No, no. My baby. No. My baby. M'lady. Thank you. I could have gotten it myself, you know. Doctor said to stay off of it as much as possible. I know. I just... I feel so useless. Don't worry. Once this all heals up I'm happy to let you wait on me as much as possible. Really? What is it? I should have told you about her. I'm sorry. You did the right thing. What happened to her, it wasn't your fault. It's just really doesn't feel like that right now. I love you. I love you, too. - Hi. - Hi. I brought you a visitor. Janie. Hey. Hi, honey. Hey. How are you, babe? Okay. I didn't know if I should come, but Miss Cummings said you'd be fine with it. More than fine. Come here. How are you holding up? I'll be fine. Eventually. Yeah. Hey. I would not be here if it wasn't for you I just keep thinking about Grace. She didn't deserve to die. Maybe if I'd done something. - Hey. - If I'd told somebody, I could have... Janie, it's not your fault. Hey, Mrs. Caldwell is thinking of establishing a new scholarship in Grace's name. She'd really like that. I know all the girls really miss you, Miss Barton. Both of you. We really miss you, too. You are coming back, aren't you? Of course we are. Come here.
