(suspenseful music) (car door slamming) - Fix your piece. Try to relax, okay? (softly snoring) (loud banging) - Roy, my friend. Pretend like you're awake, okay? - I'm here, boss, I'm ready. (door creaking) - Tax dodge here. Buys that for a thousand dollars, donates it to a museum. Marks it up to four, doubles his money in six months. This he claims as a workplace. Took off 12,000 dollars last year. Yeah, gets Attorney of the Year. His wife deducts her hair appointment. What are you doing? You're just signed out til 7:00 AM, okay? - I know. - Are you sure you're up for this? You need a minute? - Yeah. - Yeah? - No, no, no. - Good. Let's go. (music intensifying) (gasping) (loud clattering) (trunk slamming) - How long before your parole hearing? - [Officer] Any day now. - No wonder you're so uptight. (car engine humming) (woman gasping) (woman screaming) - Is anybody there? (phone ringing) - Yeah, Pete. Yeah? Yeah. What? Really? Oh, well why me? Because I'm the best. Yeah, I'll be there. I'll be there. All right. - You know what happens on a kidnapping case? They start out crying on your shoulders. By the end they're asking for your ass. - [Pete] I can handle this, sir. - You know the odds? - 50 to one. That was then, this is now. - How'd the father know to call the FBI? - He must have dealt with the feds before. A hot shot lawyer knows his business. Definitely thinks he knows ours. - You and your wife are split now, aren't you? It's temporary. - Kids? - A son. - You're not in turmoil or trying to find your inner self now, are you? - I'm at one with the universe, sir. - I make the jokes. - You're hysterical, sir. - I want you to work with Agent Yee here. You okay with that? - Do I have a choice? - No. - If you believe in her, sir, she must be outstanding. - Don't yank my chain. If the guy's half is good as he thinks he is, I'm lucky to have him. I suspect he's a train wreck waiting to happen. - Sir. - But don't let him irritate the victims and for God's sakes, don't let him near the media. - Well, Oliver, you were most cooperative. I'll make sure the warden hears about it. Give the man an extra chocolate pudding. He earned it. Good luck with the parole board. - Thank you, sir. (indistinct chatter) - So how old are you? - 30, why? - You work out? - Yes, why? - 30 is a tough age for women. - You an expert? - No babe, just observant. - Oh God, I hate guys like you. - What kind of guys are those? - Little guys that think they're better than everybody else. Guys that think they're studs. Guys that never listen. - Babe, you don't know me at all. (doorbell ringing) - Babe says it all. - [Pete] What have you got? - Some dirt from the planter in the back. Otherwise, nothing. I can't even say how he got in. - He, it's usually they. Did you see this? - [Yee] Pete. - [Pete] Dust it. - Mr. and Mrs. Jasie, this is Pete Honeycutt who's heading up the investigation. - Hi. Hi. Mr. Jasie, have you had a recent burglary? - Last week, why? - The reason I ask is one of the windows in your dining room has been re-puttied. He probably re-keyed one of the doors, put in a cylinder that any key would open. Do you have any personal enemies? - You mean someone I beat in a business deal? That sort of thing? - The notes said, "Vindictively destroyed." - No. - Probably jailhouse rhetoric. I'm willing to bet these guys did time. Now, sir, I've ordered a tap and trace. When the call comes in act naturally, don't try to stall. In any case, there's no need to worry. - I appreciate your saying that. - Insist on proof they have your son. - Do you have any nicknames for Kevin? - His grandmother calls him Kao. - You'll hear within 48 hours. - Are you speaking from experience, Mr. Honeycutt? - I'm 35 years old. I've been an agent for 13 years, and I know LA like the back of my hand. You will see Kenny again. - Kevin. - Kevin. I'm confident of that. - Unharmed. That's usually the case, isn't it? That's what my husband tells me. It's basically a business transaction. - Your husband's absolutely right. They're in it for the money. That's all it boils down to. Think they bought that? - She did, he didn't. - I gotta keep the morale up. Last thing we need is a basket case. - Kenny, that was good for morale. - [Boy] Somebody help! Help! - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! - Help, help! - Take it easy. Thought we were gonna be quiet as mice here. The nearest house is five miles away, friend. Nearest road is a mile away. These walls are soundproof. Doesn't do any good to scream. What, are these too tight? Hum? How about down here? Are they too tight? - Uh uh. - Don't make me have to tie them any tighter, all right? You're a good boy, Kevin. I bet your pals on the swim team miss you. Even if your daddy doesn't. Take it easy. - Hey boys. - [Boy] How you doing? (whistle blowing) (indistinct chatter) - [Coach] Go, go, go! - [Boy] You got it, coach. - [Coach] All the way down. - Hey. - You look good. - Thanks. We won last week. I scored eight points. - Yeah, your mom told me. I had to work. - I know, it's okay. - You need a haircut. - So do you. - I'll make an appointment for us. - Okay. When are you coming home? - I don't know, soon. - By the weekend? - I have to talk to your mom. She's a little mad at me. - I think she misses you. - Did she say something? - No, but I can tell. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Are you? - Yeah. - I miss you. - I miss you. (chuckling) - Will you be at my game? - Definitely. Go on. (tires screeching) - Where'd they put you? - Halfway house up on Bayview. I took the bus, don't worry. Nobody's seen me. - I'm not worried. I assume that's for me. - [Man] Are you sure we're up to this? - I got big plans for you, pal. Grand design. (phone ringing) - How long since the first call came in? - About 30 minutes. - Hello? - [Man] Hello Bert? - Speaking. - [Man] Yeah, listen. I want you to take Sunset Boulevard to the Coast Highway. There's a gas station right there on the corner. It's got a payphone. Why don't you just go there and wait for instructions. - Is that at the beach? - No, no, no. Bert, come on. Don't play dumb with me. You remember the Sea and Shore Club, right? Listen, why don't you let me speak to the agent in charge. - Yeah? - [Arthur] Honeycutt? - Who is this? - [Arthur] This is Dr. Know It All, Petey. Listen, why don't you tear up that list of suspects you got, okay? Believe me, you have never dealt with anybody like me. Oh and keep your nose out of this, all right? Otherwise the Jasie boy is chicken fried steak. Got it? - We get that? - Not enough time. (suspenseful music) - [Pete] We'll be six blocks behind you at all times. - Why can't we just send them money? Why all these cars? - Rachel, let him do his job. - Once your husband gives up the money, we follow it back to where they've got Kevin. - Won't they know that you're following? - I'll make sure they don't. Harrison? - Yeah? - You're in the trunk. Ah, stop bitching. They used to put me in the glove compartment. Good luck. Let's do this! (dramatic music) - Okay, Kevin, I have to go out for a little while. Now listen to me. If I find out you tried to untie yourself, I'm gonna have to give you more pain than you can possibly imagine. So don't try to wiggle free. - How will you know I moved? - See that? Instant replay. - If I die, you don't get the money. - That's true. But you're assuming I'm a rational human being. Okay, time to find out how much daddy loves you. (slow piano music) - Oliver. - Hi buddy. - What are you doing here all by yourself? - I'm waiting on somebody. - [Man] Hello? - Hi Bert, it's your pal. - [Bert] This is the fourth place you've sent me. - [Arthur] I know that. Now I want you to be somewhere else. So get in your car. Come downtown. Santa Monica Freeway. Get off at first street exit. Pull under the freeway. And there's another pay phone right there. - Got it? - Yes, but why? - Because you wanna see your progeny again alive. Now, no FBI, no media. And by the way, you might want a second opinion on that orthodonture. - He wants me to go to another phone booth. - What's the difference between a hurricane, a tornado and an ex-wife? - Nothing. They all get the house. - Oh, you heard it already? - Yeah. - He wants me to go to another phone booth. - Bert, that's the procedure. Rattle and confuse. - The first street exit under the bridge. He knows everything about me. - Bert, he's been to your home. - He knows about you too, Pete. - What can I say? He's done his homework. You okay? You wanna go through with this? - No, yes. Let's get it over with. - Okay. - Look, he said no FBI! - It's the way things are done. Harrison knows what he's doing. Don't worry. The first street bridge is three miles away. We'll be in radio contact at all times. Okay guys, hold tight. He's moving out. (dramatic music) You okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. - [Pete] Hear you loud and clear. Don't worry. It's gonna be fine, Bert. - Is this really necessary? - Yes. - Where'd you learn this stuff anyhow? - Warner Brothers. - You're kidding? - Would I kid you Oliver? Are you all right? You should take a couple deep breaths. - Good idea. - Time for you to do your thing. - [Bert] Pete, I'm here now. There's a car pulling... - Bert? Bert, where are you? - What happened? - We're out of contact. He took him to a dead zone. (dramatic music) (tires screeching) - Mr. Jasie? - There's gotta be an underpass. - Mr. Jasie, can you hear me? - Get out of the car. Don't move or you're deader than Elvis. - Where's my son? (gun firing) (siren blaring) - [Sanders] So he knew about radio dead zones. Why does that make him law enforcement? - Dead zone in the middle of LA? A cop would have access to FBI database. A cop would know that I've been assigned. - An interesting conjecture, but at the moment we'd all rather have the boy. Mr. Jasie, the search for your son has become the Bureau's number one priority. - I read you the license plate. Why haven't you found the car? - Bert, we checked the plate. The number you gave us doesn't exist. - You keep calling me Bert. - Oh, Mr. Jasie. I have every confidence in agent Honeycutt. - I'm sure you do. And I know Pete is very confident. I know that because Pete tells me every chance he gets. Meanwhile, my son is at the mercy of a madman, a madman who has my money. Kevin is a witness. Why shouldn't he kill him? I would in his place. What has he got to lose, his honor? - He may demand a second payment. - And what do I do then? How long does this go on? Only one child ever held for ransom has been returned alive. Isn't that true? - Where did you hear that? - On the news. I assume that's why you're trying to keep the media at bay because you know this whole effort is doomed to failure. - Mr. Jasie, one child. That's simply untrue. - Fortunately, my wife wasn't watching at the time. (slow music) I'm sorry. I'm sure you're doing the best you can. I'm sorry. - What do you think your mom's doing about right now, Kevin? - Crying. - How about your dad? - My dad doesn't cry. - Yeah, you sure know your parents. Moms care, dads don't. Mr. Furman, how many of these cars do you actually use for, for business? - All of them. - All of them? Hmm, hmm. Okay, no over here we have 23,500 dollars in medical expenses and only 10,300 dollars in payments to doctors. - [Furman] That's for medication. - Excuse me? - For my little boy. - Oh, for your little boy, oh. Okay, well I think I have enough to go on here. That will conclude the interview. - What do you mean you think you have enough to go on? Is that some kind of threat? - A threat? Mr. Furman, I'm just a civil servant. Now don't worry about it. We'll be in touch. Oh, and have a good time in Italy. All right. We'll give him a week and then we'll start negotiations. - I thought we were looking for a conviction? - No, no, no, no, no. First we get the money. Then we go for the convictions. - What are we doing here? - Big game, very big game. - Wait up. (whistle blowing) (indistinct chatter) - Hands up, hands up on D now. Hands up on D, hands up. - Hi, I'm Lily, Pete's partner. - Beth, his wife. - All right, okay, okay, all right. - Game started at 4:30. - Really, probably why it's the fourth quarter. Pick him up, pick him up, hands up, hands up on D, hands up on D! Charging, charging, right there! Charging, one one. Blocking, oh come on! What, are you kidding me? Blocking, he had position. Didn't he have position? - Hey, sit down or they'll throw you out again. - He had position. Hands up, look you've got three seconds here. Look you got three seconds, no! He was in the lane for about a minute. - Pete, they're ahead by 12 with 20 seconds left. Give it a rest. (pager beeping) - It's Ellis. (audience applauding) - Pick him up, pick him up! (whistle blowing) (horn bellowing) Yeah, that's it, that's it. (audience applauding) - [Coach] Hey guys, on three. One, two three. - [Team] Trojans rock! - Hey! - Hey! - Did you see my three pointer? - No, I was late, I missed it. - Nothing but net. Hey, we're going for pizza. You wanna come? - I can't, son. I've got a case. It's a kidnapping. - Yeah, we saw it on the news. Why don't you go get a soda? - [Pete] Nice job. - Thanks for coming. - Yeah, see you later. - Yeah, thanks for coming. - This case is huge, Beth. - Oh, I'm aware of how important you are. - See, right there. That's why I had to leave. - Why, because I won't... - Come on Beth. I'm not like you. I can't make a hundred grand a year working nine to six. I work for the government. You knew about that. - It's not about the job. - Yes it is about the job. - It was never about the job. - It's about the job. - It's about the overtime. The fact that there was always something that kept you away from home. That's just who you are. - It is not who I am. - Yes, you're a little boy. Arguing, you will never grow up. - [Lily] Hey. - What? - We got a break. - The vehicle? - Come on! (suspenseful music) They found flame retardant fibers in the trunk. - Kevin's pj's, any blood? - No, two containers of gasoline. - Did you catch this? - It's two plates. - [Pete] Welded together and painted over. - [Lily] Very artistic. - You know who knows this stuff? Cops. - So do robbers. - He welds the plates together so he can't trace the car. And then when he's finished, he leaves it in the middle of a baseball field? He's rubbing our noses in it, saying you can't nail me. I know everything you know. I'm gonna mess with your heads until you scream for mercy. - Hey, Pete, take a look at this clump of white powder. It's damp. - He's a very smart guy. (phone ringing) Yeah. Where? (dramatic music) (slow music) - [Pete] And you're sure only one guy brought you here? - I think so. Look, I'm not sure. I couldn't see anything. He had me blindfolded. - Think hard, Kevin. - He kept saying my dad didn't love me. - [Pete] What did he look like? - I don't know, it was dark. - You said he lifted the blindfold and looked you right in the eye. Think! - I don't remember. - You're not trying. - He had a scar, here. - A scar. That narrows the field. (suspenseful music) (glass shattering) - [Arthur] Don't worry about the lights. Furmans are in Tuscany. Italy to you. Do that every year. Fly to Milan, spend the night. And he writes it off as a business trip. The nerve of some people. They'll be back in a couple of days. I'm gonna have to spring Rearden again. We need a look out. - [Man] What's with the lookouts? I feel like I'm back in the third grade. - Well you better start growing up soon. 'Cause you are about to solo. You can't do it at night. The kid's got asthma. Room is wired for sound. His dad's got a 38 and a night table, so you're gonna have to talk your way in. - Why me? - Why not you? You think you're ready? My dad used to always say, "Hold 'em tight and let 'em go." Don't worry, you'll be stellar. That means outstanding. (computer keys clicking) - It's diatomaceous earth. - What is? The white powder I found in the stolen Ford. It's used in swimming pool filters. We found the owner of the car. She doesn't have a pool. Doesn't service pools. Doesn't work for a company that makes or uses DE - DE? - Diatomaceous earth - What is that? - I'll come back later. - Now, now I'm listening. How does this help us? - We've got no witnesses. Kevin Jasie gave us nothing. The father never got a proper look at the kidnappers. We may need this to get a conviction. - No. - I see. Excuse me. - He's not through with me yet. - Through with you? - Us, the bureau. - Pete, can I tell you why you're taking this so personally? - I know, I know. Because I have a son and I feel guilty about not being in his life. And our rogue cop, whoever he is, is using cop knowledge for private gain, something I was specifically trained not to do. Plus if I screw up again the director's gonna ship my ass to Louisiana. Am I leaving anything out? - Whenever you get a chance. Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - We need to talk. - Yeah, sure. Come on, sit down. - Did, did you tell Sam that it was my fault you moved out? - No. I told him I wanted to come home, but you were angry. - So as usual, you assume no responsibility. - I want to come home. - Doesn't work for me. - What about Sam? - Don't talk to me about Sam. All he wants is to be with you, and you barely give him the time of day. How often have you been to see him in the last three months? - I used to see him every day when I was home. - You looked over the paper at him at breakfast, which I cooked. You played ball with him on weekends. And then you looked in on him sleeping when you got home at night, the nights you did get home. You weren't present. - I work, Beth. - I work too. You wanna be a father? He finishes school at three. Nothing would make him happier than to spend time with his dad this weekend. - I'm in the middle of a case. - The Jasie boy is home now, isn't he? Take a break! - I'll pick him up at three. Okay? One thing. Where's the school? I'm kidding. (school bell ringing) - What are you doing here? - What do you mean? I'm your father. - Is mom okay? - She's great. You need some help? What should we do when you're finished? - I don't care. - [Pete] What do you do with your mom? - Eat dinner. - Dinner. (slow music) - You've been here for three months. - I eat out a lot. Tomorrow we shop. - Hi, Arthur Milo, Internal Revenue. - Reason? - Need him to identify some evidence. - And expected time of return? - Oh, give me about five or six hours. So how's your sister? - Oh, much better since you killed the audit. - Yeah. Well, I guess I was put on this earth to help others. God knows what the others are doing here. (typewriter clicking) Vindictively, not viciously. - Sorry. (typewriter clicking) - [Arthur] Alive, Roy. - [Woman] Who is it? - I have a delivery. Floral Paradise. - [Woman] Come on in. - Here you go. I'll take care of the van. Break a leg. (suspenseful music) (doorbell ringing) - Hi. (Arthur softly humming) - Another kidnapping? When did it happen? Yeah, no, no, okay. No, no, no, I'll be there. I'll be there. - Today we shop, right? - [Pete] I'm sorry about breakfast. We gotta do an errand. Two more plates welded together. Same guy, same MO. Same rubbing our noses in it. Keep an eye on him, will you? - You need a haircut. - [Man] Now how far away do the Jasie's live from us? - [Woman] Half a mile. - So what you're saying is that somebody broke into that house and a week later they came back and abducted the kid. How come the FBI didn't tell us about this? - We didn't know about the robbery, sir. - Who's this? - This is agent Honeycutt. He's heading up the investigation. - Don't you people talk to the Beverly Hills police? - Excuse me, sir. Were you wearing that necklace when he answered the door? - Yeah, yes. - You've got two name attorneys living a couple blocks from one another. Both have young sons, firstborn sons, same ransom demand. - Why didn't he just take the necklace? It's worth as much as the ransom. - He was in a hurry. - No, my guy isn't stupid. - Your guy? - A, we're dealing with a copycat crime or B, we're dealing with a cop that's hiring some loser to do his dirty work. What is that look? - Nothing. - No, I know a look when I see a look. Take your shot, babe. Say what you gotta say. - I think you're completely in the dark. - I know you think you're supremely precocious, but I've been with the bureau twice as long as you. - Which is why it's amazing you haven't learned how to talk to people. - People listen to me. I don't put 'em to sleep when I talk. Diatomaceous earth? Give a break. I'm sorry. I just, I wanna kill the son of a bitch. It's a figure speech. Let's get a beer. I'm kidding. See how serious she is? She has no sense of humor. - You too. - [Man] I gave him his medicine. - Excellent. I think maybe I should up the ante. - More than 250? - She's got jewelry worth three times that much. - [Man] Oh no, she was wearing this? - Yeah. - How did I miss it? - Right. (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Caller] Hello? - Who is this? - Who is this? - [Pete] It's Pete Honeycutt. Who are you trying to reach? - Pete, this is David Furman. What is it? - You called me. - I didn't call you, you called me. I was fast asleep. - Hello, David. Hello, Pete. - [David] Who's that? - Listen, I just called to tell you that Davy is fine. He's taken his asthma medication. Sleeping soundly. Oh Pete, I didn't wake you up, did I? Well, that's right. You're working around the clock, aren't you? - What do you want? - [Arthur] Well, I'm glad you asked What I want is 20 dollar bills. 12,500 of them, as a matter of fact. - And how am I supposed to accomplish that? - Hey, you're the lawyer. You figure it out. Now listen, tomorrow I want you to take Sixth Street downtown to the wholesale produce market. The first light, take a right. Go around the corner. Take the Seventh Street entrance. There's a phone booth right there. That's tomorrow afternoon. Four o'clock, okay. And Pete, well, forget it. Matter of fact, if I see any FBI at all, the kid dies. - [Pete] Hello? Hello? - He's gone. Pete, who is this guy? - I don't know, but it's good he's talking to us. It's very good. I'll be over in the morning, you okay? - What am I supposed to do? - I know it seems impossible, but try to get some rest. - [David] Yeah. Right. Goodnight. - Goodnight. - What was that? - That was someone who needs dad's help. Come on, I gotta get you back to bed. Got a big day tomorrow. - Are we gonna play ball? - Son, I gotta go in to work. - But it's Sunday. - I know, but another boy's been kidnapped. (grunting) - Can I go with you like I did today? - No. - Are you gonna take me back to mom's? - Tell you what. Eat some breakfast. You hang out with your mom for a few hours. We'll meet at the park. We'll play a little one on one. - Okay. (slow music) - Sleep well, son. - Dad. Put the groceries away. - Oh yeah. I'll probably send you two or three phones first. Just know what's gonna happen. You won't get so crazy. Harrison. - How did he get your number? - Off some computer. - Did you... - Yeah, I set up a tap and trace. It's dealt with, Ellis. I'm not worried. Agent Yee. - [Arthur] You okay? - I'm fine. It's under control. - First job I ever had was in the market. Went back later and robbed it. - What'd you get? - Six months, good behavior. - You did time? - I was 19, I was green. I figured I'd get caught. I needed to see what jail was all about. Make a couple of friends, contact here, there. Mostly a bunch of morons. - So how'd you get a government job? - You've been to a post office lately? Seen who works there. I guess I slipped through the cracks. (suspenseful music) - It's cool. No, definitely not cool. - Nothing's happening. Nothing. - He ain't coming. (car door slamming) - David, I'm sorry. I mean he must have... (phone ringing) - Yeah? - Honeycutt? - Petey. Petey, Petey, Petey. When are you gonna learn? I told you no FBI. Now you gotta tell Mr. Furman his kid is in great danger. Now just... Well, I'll be in touch. - [Pete] Hey. - [Sam] You're late. - Yeah we had a break in the case. Looked like we're gonna... - I don't care. - I'm sorry. - You say that a lot. You wanna play? - We should go. - My out. - Why? - You were late. - Oh yeah. We don't flip. We don't do nothing else. All of a sudden that's gonna be it. It's my out. He goes up! Oh no, he shoots, he scores! Oh, good shot, good shot. - Have you been watching the news about that little Furman boy that was kidnapped? I mean, if the kid is dead that's tragic. But if he's not, I'm not all that upset. Lawyers. They're always taking advantage of people. It's sort of like a Robin Hood kind of thing. Don't you think? - Yeah, I'll tell you the truth. I haven't been following it. Buddy. - You like my little joint, huh? - It is terrific. Hey, listen, buddy. Why don't you sit down here. Talk to the ladies in there. I've gotta make a call. - [Buddy] I'd love to. - You know Gigi, this is Rebecca. Hey pal, are you all right? - It's all over the TV. The mother's having a nervous breakdown. The FBI is calling it their number one priority right now. - Just take it easy, okay? - I just came from the house. The kid, he's on a hunger strike or something. He won't take his medication. I can't even call the doctor. Or the police. - Everything's gonna be fine. (phone ringing) (chuckling) - Yeah? Who is this? Whoa, whoa, start over. I can hardly understand you. What is this, a joke? Frankie, is this you? Then who is it? How come you sound like you're chewing on a washcloth? All right, take it easy. The who? (suspenseful music) He said, "I'll blow his brains out if I don't get the money." A quarter of a million in 20 dollar bills. - You have no idea who this guy is or why he would call you? - I guess he thought I could be of assistance. - You wanna know my hunch? I think some officer's shaking your tree. - How come he knew the ransom demand? - I can't be sure he did, can I? All I know is, you know it. - Fine. This is great. You know, I call you guys hoping to be of service to my country. Next thing I know, I'm talking to some punk agent who's outta options and he's hinting I should call my attorney. I'll tell you what, if this fellow calls again, I'll keep it to myself. And you can go on wasting the taxpayer's money. - Don't worry, Buddy. If he calls again, we'll be listening. Better warn your book maker. (phone ringing) - [Man] Hello? - [Caller] Are you ready for instructions? - I gotta talk to the kid first. - [Davy] Hello? - Hello, Davy. This is a friend of your dad's. What is the name of your pet turtle? - Misty. - [Buddy] That's right. Put the man back on. - Okay. - Hey there. - Okay, we can proceed. Let me tell you what the terms are. First, no more phone calls. And second, you gotta bring the kid because his dad's gonna be along. - I want both parents along. I will deliver the child to Union Station. Metro line, at platform, across from your place. 7:30 tonight. The Furman's will wait at the entrance to the main station. You go downstairs, drop the satchel by the escalator, near the train. I drop the kid. He comes running to you, and everyone goes home happy. - Ask him why he wants both parents along. - Why do you want both parents along? - Good. (suspenseful music) (doors creaking) - What are you doing? - They might see us. The kid is there. - Okay. - Would you like a drink? You sure? It's cold, it's good. - [Pete] Got his fortune. He's tanked up. I should have known. - Well where are they, Honeycutt? I think we've been stood up, - Turn around. He's right in front of your face. - [Man] I don't see any kid. - What the hell? - What do you want me to do? - [Pete] Turn around. (music intensifying) - Hey! - Oh my God! - Agent needs help, now! - Davy, Davy, get out! Get out! (gun firing) (boy gasping) You okay, you okay? How's Davy? - Couple of bruises. Tracy's got a busted leg. - How bad? - Flesh wound. - What can you say? - [Nurse] Sir! - I need a moment alone with the prisoner, please. - [Nurse] All right, quiet. - Sir please don't let them give me any drugs. I had Askomelyis with I was 14 years old. It gave me a Demoral habit. That's how I landed in jail. - Let's talk about the Jasie job. - I don't know anything about that. I was in jail... - You know who did it, don't you? (man screaming) You're looking at kidnapping with bodily harm. That's life without parole. - I'm in awe, did you know that? - Threw your shot at an FBI agent holding a small child. God I'd hate to see them gas the wrong guy. Wouldn't you? Where was your mentor today? Mentor? (chair clamoring) - Deserted you, huh? What kind of cop is he? He is a cop, isn't he? I'm getting warm, aren't I? Aren't I, Oliver, come on, come on. Tell me, okay! - Pete, Pete! - It's okay. (chuckling) (slow suspenseful music) Beth, Beth. Sorry, can I come in? I'm sorry, it's late, I know. - Congratulations. - You saw the news, huh? - And so did Sam. - When he grabbed that kid, I swear I heard Sam calling for help. I just went crazy. - You want something to eat? - No, no, no, I'm fine, thanks. - I mean, Sam, did he say anything? Does he understand? - You're, you're gonna be a show and tell tomorrow. - Beth? - Yes? - There's something I wanna say. I mean, there's something I need to say. I, you know when I was growing up, I was always alone. I was always playing by myself or making things up, and my dad was always gone. And he worked those two jobs and I mean, he loved me, but, but he thought he was supposed to work all the time. And that's what honorable men did. And that's all I knew. I thought I was doing things just right. You gotta believe me. - I know. - I'm sorry. I miss you. (phone ringing) - Who knows you're here? - Nobody. - Hello? - Yeah, Pete. Hey, they're not paying you enough, pal. I bet your family's real proud though, huh? - How's it going? - Ah, it couldn't be better. Couldn't be better, thanks. When I couldn't get you at your apartment, I thought you might be at this number. Listen, I got a little favor to ask of you. - [Pete] Go ahead. - Who is that? Is that you, Margaret. Is that you? Oh nevermind. Pete, listen, a little favor. You're gonna have to lay off my boy. - I can't do that. - [Arthur] Well, I'm afraid you're gonna have to. - Or what? - Well, Pete, come on. You know, I got a very fertile imagination. I mean the last, oh, wait a minute. I, I gotta go. Oh, I'll be talking to you. Oh, by the way, how is little Sam? - How many times has he called? - Two, three times. - You're having our phone tapped. - It's a precaution. - How does he know our names? - He's got access to everything. DMV, birth records. What are you calling? - My sister. - He's not coming after Sam. - How do you know what he's gonna do? - Because there's no money in it. He's bluffing. He's trying to get my goat. If you want to go to your sister's, I'll take you. What are you doing up? - I heard you guys arguing. - Not arguing. Come on, back to bed. - Are you gonna stay? - I don't know. - Why can't you and mom just get along? - Look, I'm gonna do better, I promise. - Goodnight, dad. - Goodnight. - [Mom] Night Sam. - You gotta promise too, mom. - I promise. - [Sam] Goodnight, mom. - Beth, I got 36 agents working under me. I can spare a couple to watch you and Sam. - You called me Margaret. - That's your name? - I used Margaret in 10 years. Every insurance form, every credit card... - Whoa, whoa, whoa, when did you change? - After we got married. - How'd he get it? - Well when Sam was born. Birth certificate, no. What has all of our names on it? I mean, who knows everything about everybody? (suspenseful music) - I'll walk. - Here we go. - Thank you, thanks a lot. Thank you. - When was he due back? - [Woman] Overdue. - Well who singed him out? Why didn't you call the FBI? - He wasn't with the FBI. - Then he's with the IRS. Why didn't you call the IRS? - It's' not part of the procedure. - All right, let me see the paperwork. Don't tell me you don't have the paperwork. - Yes, I have the paperwork. And please try to control your temper. Check Tracy's prison record. Find out how many times he's been signed out and by whom. And give a list of all sign outs in the last five years.- - Right. - Cross cheek those with all unsolved kidnappings an burglaries. - Want to hear the diatomaceous earth report? - Yeah, all right. - I went back to the original samples. It contains both fresh and saltwater organisms. - Is that good news or bad news? - It's good news. It narrows our search for the factory by 100 fold. - Right. - Here's the signature. - Tracy. I can't read that, what does that say? What, what is it? - It says Pete Honeycutt. - Pete. - Yeah. - Another break-in at the Furman's. They got the jewels she was wearing the day of the kidnapping. - It's not they, it's he. And I want an agent at my house 24 hours a day. I want him taking my kid to school. I want him staying there, and I want him bringing him home. - You want him inside the school? - Yeah, fine, he can even teach class. - [Man] Arthur, how about it? - Sorry about that. - You've been really quiet. You ain't mad at me? - No. - [Man] How long am I signed out for? - [Arthur] 12 hours. - [Man] Burglary? - No. There you go. Be careful. - So the FBI's putting on the screws. - [Arthur] Yeah, Pete Honeycutt. - Arthur, I didn't tell them anything. - [Arthur] Good. - [Man] He thinks that I pulled both jobs. - [Arthur] Yeah. - Isn't that something. Did you get the jewelry? - You know, when I was 13 years old my dad took me hunting. I remember he taught me how to make a fire. And he said, "Son, go back into the forest and get some more wood." I said, "Dad, we don't need anymore," but he was adamant. Nope, we need some more wood. And, hey pull that thing down. - Sure Artie. - So, back in I go. And I'm picking up this wood, and all of a sudden I hear this crack. Like this. (gun firing) Well, I dropped that wood and I came running out of that forest as fast as my feet could carry me, and I nearly tripped over his dead body. (door clattering) (birds chirping) Okay, Roy, take that blindfold off. Come on out. Here you go. - What do you want me to dig? - A hole, about ye wide. Six feet deep. - Where? - [Arthur] Right here. - This wouldn't be my grave, would it? - You're my friend, aren't you? At least I thought you were my friend. I'm never ashamed to ask a friend for help. - Makes sense. - People who need people, right? - Right. - [Arthur] They are the luckiest people in the world. - Six feet deep? - Um hum, about six. Okay, Roy, give me the shovel. Give me the shovel. - Holy dear mother of God. (indistinct praying) - Come on Cinderella, before you turn into a pumpkin. Roy, thanks. Hope we get a chance to work together again soon. Take care. (door clanking) - What is it? - Beth doesn't answer. (dramatic music) (tires screeching) Beth? Beth? Beth? Beth? - Hi. - Where have you been? - At the dentist. Why are you here? What's wrong? - Nothing, nothing. I just, I forgot something I needed, that's it. Hey pal. - You okay, dad? - Sure. (phone ringing) - Hello. - Is Pete Honeycutt there, please? Pete, it's Lilly. Is everything okay there? - Yeah, everything's fine. - [Lily] I got something for you babe. I crosschecked for robberies. - And? - I'm gonna put someone on for you, okay? Hold on. - Mr. Honeycutt, I know the man you're looking for. If you can protect me, sir, I'd like to cut a deal. He comes to see me in the joint, tells me he's connected with the government. He knows my family has some tax problems, but I'd like them to go away. I say, yeah, sure. He says, "Well, you went to jail for armed robbery. Would you like to keep your hand in?" Week later he signs me out. - And he never told you his name? - [Roy] Just his first name. - Amazing. What is it? - Arthur. - Arthur? Just one name, like Prince or Madonna? Come on, Roy. - How many jobs did you do for Arthur? - I was a lookout, that's all. I didn't even drive the getaway car. - What did Arthur need you for? - [Roy] Likes having people around. - What do you mean? - Well, he can't bear to be alone, you know. He can't eat alone. He can't go to the movies alone. - Who's Oliver Tracy? - Never heard of him. - You're gonna take the fall, Roy, for the whole deal. - He's dead, isn't he? - I don't know. - I think he killed him. - Did you, Roy? You can tell us. - I never saw the body. All I did was dig the hole. - Roy. - Where was this? - This, this pad, this hideout. - And what kind of area was that? - Industrial. - Do any of these factories ring a bell? - I don't know. I remember there was a smoke stack. - I'm letting him sign you out again. - I don't know anything about any kidnappings. I swear on my mother's eyes. - I'm setting you up, I'm letting Arthur sign you out! Guard! - Come on guys. - He'll kill him, Pete. - I don't care whether this sorry piece of trash buys. Guard! - Pete! - Milo! Arthur Milo. - Call the IRS. Find out which office Milo's in. - I'll Ellis about what's happening. - Leave a message at my home where to find you. No question he's gonna do it again. - [Woman] Excuse me, if you'll just tell me what you're looking for. - Current files, target cases. - We started going after a loan operation. Is that the sort of thing you need? Hey, you can't go through Mr. Milo's files. What's this? - A warrant. - This can't be the same Arthur Milo. - [Lily] Pete. - [Woman] He used to be in an elite unit that guarded the president. - I guess they don't screen any better than you guys. (dramatic music) (indistinct chatter) (computer beeping) - Attorneys, Pete. (computer keyboard clicking) (doorbell ringing) - Whatcha doing, mister? - You scared me. You shouldn't sneak up on people like that, you know it? - Who are you? - Oh, I'm just the, the silver man. I have to take all this silver and polish it up for your mom and dad. You must be Donnie, right? - Uh huh. - [Arthur] So why aren't you on vacation? - I didn't wanna go. - Oh, hum, who's taking care of you, housekeeper? That would be Maria, right? Where's Maria? - She's next door. - Next door. Just jabbering with her friends, huh? You must be lonely here, huh? Kind of hard when parents, mom and dad, go off and leave you all alone. You love your dad? - Um hum. - Yeah. I wonder why he, why he left you all alone? Well, I'll tell you something. If I were your dad I wouldn't leave you all alone. Oh, I gotta get something out of the truck. You want to help me? - No. - No, no? How come, huh? How come you're so unfriendly? - I have to go. - Come on, hey where are you going, pal? (phone ringing) Come here a minute. Donnie. You wanna play games, huh? Okay. - [Lindy] Hi, this is Lindy. - I'm gonna get you. - [Don] This is Don. Please leave a message at the... (beeping) - [Pete] This message is for Arthur. This is the FBI. Leave the boy where he is. Come out the front door with your hands clasped behind your head. - Listen to me, Donnie. If you ever wanna see your mom and dad again, you behave yourself. Do you understand that? Not a sound. - Did you get that, Milo? Give yourself up. I promise you you'll stay alive. Any trouble, I'll make sure they let me administer the gas. - Who is this? - Nice to hear your voice again. It's Pete Honeycutt. - Never heard of you. This is a plumber. - Oh, come on Milo. We've been to your place. We've been in your computer. It's all over. - Hey! - That's a good move, Arthur. That one's gonna count in your favor. - Oh Pete, I thought you were a real man. You show up with a whole SWAT team. - Milo? Milo? Milo? - Why don't you go after some real criminals? - Milo? Milo? (dramatic music) - [Lily] Hold on. - Good job. Son. (slow music) - Hey. - Hey. What are doing here? Your face is all over the news. - Playing ball with Sam. - You wanna stay for dinner? Just dinner. - That'd be okay with you?
