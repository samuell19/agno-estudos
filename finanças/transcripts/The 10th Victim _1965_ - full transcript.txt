- Stop. - Hunter. Let me see. Go ahead. Ladies and gentlemen, I'II repeat the rules of the Big Hunt... a worldwide institution... which has brought morality to this century... and has enchained and legalized violence. Rule number one: every participant must take part in ten hunts... five as hunter and five as victim, alternately... paired off each time by our electronic selecting device in Geneva. Rule number two: the hunter knows everything about the victim... name, address, habits. Rule number three: the victims do not know who their hunters are. They must identify and eliminate them. Rule number four: the winner of each individual hunt is entitled to a prize. He who reaches the goal of ten hunts and is still alive... will be declared the "decaton"... and he'll receive highest honors... plus one million dollars! THE TENTH VICTIM What do you want? Friends, we are proud to present our special act. Here, for the first time in New York... the most exciting show of your life. Take off my mask. A souvenir. - Is he dead? - Yes. - Is everything in order? - Seems to be. Congratulations! Your card. Quiet, please! - Hunter or victim? - Victim, ninth hunt. - A valid kill. - Credit the winnings to my account. Only at Masoch Club... can you see these one of a kind shows: a real chase, a real victim and a real killing! I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the Department of the Big Hunt... for granting authorization to Signorina Caroline Meredith... to kill this man for your viewing pleasure. Applause! Can I have an autograph? Excuse me, let me through! - Signorina Meredith? - Can I help you? I'm Morton Duit of the Ming Tea Company of San Francisco... - America's foremost tea importers. - Yes, the foremost! That killing was very skillful. - Thanks. - I'd like to make you an offer. Would you be interested in televising your 1Oth hunt on a magnificent TV show? - A magnificent show! - A million dollar deal. Ming Tea TV commercials are viewed by 100 million Americans. It would be a wonderful opportunity for you! Do you hear your fans? After that show, you would be even more popular. It depends on the price. Talk to my agent about it. Very well. Calling to the field, Baron de Charlus, Signor Del Corso... and Baron Von Rauschenberg. Boots! Baron! Thanks. I don't play. I wanted to inform you that it'll be your turn soon. There are two horses before you. Good luck. Baron Von Rauschenberg has withdrawn. His place will be taken by Marquis Guicciardini Guidi... riding on horse number 22. - Victim or hunter? - Hunter P2929, sixth hunt. Go ahead and check. - Congratulations. - Thank you. He's dead. - Department of the Hunt? - Yes? - I'm reporting a valid kill. - Location? It happened in Piazza di Siena... victim number 113562. Why didn't you kill him in his hometown of Hamburg? He was coming to the horse show. It was more convenient for me. Why did you use explosives? Armored Baron, explosive boot. Do you prefer to be the hunter or the victim? The hunter. - Why? - It's easier. What will you do now that it's your turn to be the victim? I'll manage. What's your favorite vitamin? ZB 1002. Do you believe the Big Hunt is a way to vent aggression? Somewhat. - Your favorite comic book? - The Phantom. I'm a romantic. True, you don't seem violent or aggressive at all. Indeed. - Do you believe in God? - Yes. - In family? - Not as much. - Do you hope to be Italy's "decaton"? - If my nerves hold up. So you're a coward. You're afraid to die? Of course. - Why did you go blond? - Enough, everyone out! We've broadcasted an interview with Marcello Poletti... Tommaso, my friend. You're the only one who understands me. Come, come to me. Come here! You're tickling me! Hello? Marcello, guess what I dreamt? That your marriage was already annulled but you hadn't told me. Aren't dreams strange? I'll call your wife now. At least she'll tell me the truth. You're impossible to keep up with. Hello? We remind all members of the organization... that the deadline is nearing... for renewal of your hunter's license. Prevent the dangers of a war of the masses. Sign up for the Big Hunt. Only the Big Hunt offers you a sense of security. DEPARTMENT OF THE BIG HUNT The office is at fault, not me! What did he do? He killed a Corsini instead of a Borsini. Thirty years in jail. If we were to go back in history... in Roman times we would've found the forerunners... of this safety valve of humanity. If there had been the Big Hunt in 1940... Hitler would have participated... thus preventing World War Two. With the Big Hunt, everything can be resolved. No more wars and man's violent instinct can be expressed... through an individual and monitored competition. Marcello Poletti, sixth hunt prize claim. THE PRIZE WAS CLAIMED BY MRS. LIDIA POLETTI We got divorced six days ago. - Didn't they tell you? - No. When did she pick it up? An hour ago. Prevent the dangers of a war of the masses. Sign up for the Big Hunt. Legalize your homicides. Only the Big Hunt offers you a sense of security. An enemy a day keeps the doctor away. Don't push me away. Keep kissing me! Please! It's against the rules! Why control birth rates... when we can increase death rates? Live dangerously, but by the law. Suicides... with the Big Hunt there's a place for you too. Headquarters, Agent 819. Reporting a valid kill, at 10:34. - Location? - Stairs of the Department of the Hunt. - May I go now? - One moment. Live dangerously, but by the law. Is that your car? Yes. I'll have to fine you for illegal parking. GENEVA Selector machines numbers 7 and 8... have chosen Signorina Caroline Meredith, American... as hunter number 14632... and Signor Marcello Poletti, Italian... as victim number 14879. The victim resides in Rome, Italy. Provide the hunter with all information regarding the victim. Why can't we use St. Peter's? After all, the Pope's American, modern. - Can you picture me as a nun? - I prefer filming in the studios. You can forget about it! We're in Rome with all these piazzas, domes and ruins... and you want to be locked up in the film studios? The Vatican would never allow it. They're opposed to the Big Hunt. I have connections. Maybe they'd make an exception. If only we could film in a location like this! I spent a honeymoon here with my 18th wife. I still prefer filming in the studios. Enough already! Filming in a studio while in Rome, how ridiculous! - This piazza could work. - It'll make quite an impression! Try to imagine Poletti's corpse in that central fountain. Hold on a second! I've got the best idea... the Colosseum! That way we could use gladiators during the show. We can't go over budget! Gladiators come cheap in Rome... plus ancient Rome has always been a big hit with the American market. True! They too used to kill each other to entertain the Romans. Let's not make this more difficult. It's best to film in the studios. Plus, the costumes are already done, you know. - I'd like to be Cleopatra. - She has nothing to do with it. How do you expect to film in there? Look, it's full of holes! Maybe you're right. It's too run down. How would the dancers move? They're not goats you know. We need to find another location. Hold on, look over there! Caroline, kill him there! This way we'll have the Colosseum in the background... and plenty of space. - What is it called? - The Temple of Venus. I'll kill him there. May we? - Who are you? - It's us, confiscation. - How are you, Signor Poletti? - Fine. Take a seat. You could have called first. Well? The bed is mine by law. You also have the right to a chair and table, like last time. If you don't mind, take the TV last. As you wish. You're still hunting, correct? I'm a fan of these hunts. I know everything about you. You're so lucky! In America the explosive cookie has hit the market. - What's going on here? - Official confiscation. - In that case, I'll help you. - Thanks. Finally, we can change furniture. The Homosexual Union has lifted its ban on the Big Hunt. No, not the classics! Marcello, they can't do this. Say something! What will we read if they take our classics away? It's a valuable collection... thus, all the more confiscatable. Marcello, say something. Hold on, Iâ€™ll help you! I've got a Golden Age Flash from 1935. I know, that's my point. Images of Chu Tse's triumph... the third citizen of our hemisphere... who has reached the goal of ten successful hunts. - Enough of this hunt! - Quiet! Hello, Italian viewers. I'm reporting from Hong Kong. Today all of China is gathered to celebrate its new hero. Now he shall obtain the recognition... with which our society honors his greatness, his courage: total tax exemption, a government car... free entrance to any show, train and plane discounts. See him walk through the crowds... the "decaton" Chu Tse... protected by an immense umbrella shaped like the sun... representing his fame. See you at the next confiscation. Terribly sorry about your classics, Ma'am. Miss! And happy hunting. Hello? Neo-Gothic furniture for five rooms please. - Who'll pay for it? - You, with your next hunt. - What if I die? - The insurance. Oh, sorry. Address is Lungotevere Fellini 149. Top floor. Thank you. Leave me alone. Play with Tommaso. - How old is Poletti? - Forty years old. - Married? - Of course. - How many times? - Once. Once? - Is he normal? - Kind of. We've got the Temple of Venus. We can get started. - Wealthy? - Kind of. - What's his sign? - Gemini. - Watch out: fakes and liars. - He has nice hands though. We've tracked him down on the monitor. Hello? Mobile Cam 1 here. We're following the subject in question. He's just left his home. - Where are we? - The Spanish Steps. He probably just woke up. He's the typical Italian who likes to be in the sun... just like a cat. - He looks tired. - Maybe he sleeps too much. The ideal victim. I distrust lazy people. They're hard to handle. - What's he picking up? - A doll? - Could he be a sexual maniac? - Could be. What's happening? They're fighting. Look how indifferent he is. - Who are those people? - Scholars. They're discussing art. - Are you sure he's been informed? - Let me check. Look, he's going to the usual place, just as predicted. If you hurry you can catch him there. - Department of the Hunt information? - Yes? Could you please tell me if number B2738... Poletti Marcello, has received his formal hunt notification? - Already notified. - He has. Is it a place for men only? I don't think so. There's a diet snack-bar on the terrace where he eats every day. Anyone can go in there. Go, hurry up! - Follow them, Chet. - Okay. Hello? Chet here. Martin here. What's the situation? I'm in front of the snack-bar. Poletti's already here. Caroline's caught up with him on the terrace. - Keep an eye on them. - Okay, over and out. What do you want? I'm an American. I feel lonely. I feel like talking to someone, but if I'm bothering you... You got it. You're bothering me. I'm Caroline Meredith. And? Are you busy tonight? Most likely I'II be dead by tonight. How brave to expose yourself this way. I don't have enough money to organize an efficient defense. Seeing that your life is at stake, it seems... Good luck! Stop! You can't shoot here! You can't shoot in bars, please! - Since when? - The first of the month. There's a notice downstairs. Inform yourselves before hunting. I'll give you a minute head start. What kind of a life is this? Can't shoot in hospitals, or restaurants... or churches, or barber shops... or in nursery schools! We can't shoot anywhere anymore. They should stop the hunt all together. - Good-bye. Good luck. - Thanks. Excuse me. I once saw one loaded with a Colt 45. In America there aren't many limitations for you hunters. Anyone can shoot where and when they want. America is another world. You answer. Is Marcello Poletti there? - Signor Poletti isn't here. - Damn. - All right? - Thank you. RELAX IN 3,000 METERS RELAX IN 500 METERS I want to relax. - Asian or Nordic? - Nordic. - Paid membership? - No, cash. Sign here. Heavy, light or very light music? Peroxide blond? I've never seen you here before. I'm Astrid. What are your preferences? A particular atmosphere? I've got an arousing wolves' howl in the wind. Sweetie. Or do you prefer the takeoff of a super rocket to the moon? Or I have the rustling of intimate apparel. You're a tough one. Here, lean against my bosom. I know the fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood. Want to hear it? - Did I ask you to speak? - No. I only came here to reflect. I was doing it for you... but if silence turns you on more, as you wish. Why are you following me? What do you want? - Can you spare a few minutes? - No, I don't have time. - Listen- - I'm busy. I'm conducting a survey on the sexual behavior of Italian men. That's why I'm following you. I don't feel like talking. Why? Because there's no sexual behavior or man to talk about! I'm the spokeswoman for millions of unsatisfied women. I'm conducting a live survey, and I'd like to ask you a few questions... have an experience, and interview you at the Temple of Venus. Please say yes! Why me? Because I'd prefer a difficult man, like you. Please don't disappoint me. Come to the Temple of Venus. All done. Pulse of 90, not too bad. How many shots did you count, Marcello? - How many did you count? - Twenty-five. There were fifty. You're in bad shape. Yes, I know. - Do you want to exercise? - No, it's pointless. Marcello, you're a bundle of nerves. I'm going to die. Are you happy? I know you'll die. What's important is how you die. Like a rabbit or a samurai? Aim higher, you idiot! I've been in the hunt for 48 hours, and nothing's happened. Of course I'm nervous. There are two possibilities: the hunter either isn't here yet or is here and toying with your nerves. Do you have armor? Are you armed? You pity yourself too much. You're reckless! Remember that the selection is tough. Only 15 hunters in the whole world have survived the 10 hunts. Wait, you have to pay me! You owe me for 15 sessions you did in my gym. You owe me money! - Do you have it? - Next time. If there'll be a next time. Shake this for good luck. - Not the good hand! - There's no poison. Damn you! - Caroline? - Yes? We've lost track of him also. Maybe it's for the best. They aren't ready yet at the Temple of Venus. A perfect example of disorganization. A little disorganization doesn't hurt. Maybe it's the air in Rome. Well, something will happen. I hope so. I've called all the hotels. At the Excelsior, two Mexicans have checked in. The maid says they aren't armed. Maybe they're refugees. At the Ambasciatori, there are 20 Russians, from the co-ops. They're meeting with the Pope. Listen, I... Why don't they pick up the bodies? I'm in trouble. I'II sleep at your place for a few nights. - Did you argue with Olga? - No, but I want to end it. I need to cheer myself up. Give me an injection. - Does she know about the annulment? - No! Let's go. An American approached me, saying she wanted to interview me. - What's her name? - Caroline Meredith. She seems strange. Do you know anything? I've got it... She's at the Hilton with a group of Americans. They work for TV. They're unarmed. Are you sure? If I said it, I know it. - Left or right? - I don't remember. We began a week ago with the left. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. It's the left, ready? - Did you find him? - Yes, at the beach. - Where? - With the Sunsetters. - West of Fiumicino? - Correct. - Should Caroline come back? - Yes. We've got time. Poletti usually rests at this time of day. He puts on make up before going to work. We have until sunset. - Okay. - Understood, keep in contact. Over and out. - Caroline? - Yes. As soon as you can, come back. Poletti's gone to the Sunsetters. Where are the Sunsetters? Look at the map. West of Fiumicino, there's an arrow indicating the precise location. You have until sunset. Good evening. - Brother Marcello! - Brothers! You won't give up this stupid survey. You're stubborn. You're so unpredictable. I just can't help but follow you. Join the others. You'll witness a very moving moment. There's nothing to laugh about! Enjoy your work. Today, the light shall dim at 7:30 p. m. Meditate on the sunset. We were casually born... but luckily we shall casually die. SUNSETTERS This last ray of light... comes to us from 149 million kilometers away. Our father is leaving. With our eyes we see him die out, but we must not despair. Crying purifies. It liberates us from our daily anguish. Let us remember... that as we follow the agony of our beloved friend... our brothers in California are greeting the rebirth of morning. Now, let us concentrate. The magic moment is about to strike! In ten... ...nine... eight... ...seven... six... ...five... four... ...three... two... ...one! Brothers... pay no attention to these vulgar neorealists. Cry, brothers! Free yourselves! Are you crying? You've never seen a sunset? When I was a kid, but I had forgotten about it. - Brothers, sisters! - Long live the Sunsetters! Thank you. Now enter the waters and purify yourselves! Marcello, are you coming in with us? I can't tonight either, but I'm with you. Go. I see you're crying too. Of course, I took two "Tearaid" pills. The effect lasts at least 15 minutes. You don't believe in what you preach? I have to believe it. It's 20% of the income. You can't imagine what happened when I started it all... It was even recommended by psychoanalysts, the TV... Then those damned vulgar neorealists ruined me. Then why don't you stop? Is this an interview or simple curiosity? Both. Everything has its price. How much? Three hundred dollars. Four hundred, five hundred... Even a thousand if you want. How long will this job take? An hour, maybe two. Where will it take place? At the Temple of Venus, near the Colosseum. Isn't it late to do it now? Weâ€™ll work all night. We have a lot to do. There's no advance payment? I see you're very trusting. Five hundred dollars. I'll get dressed and weâ€™ll leave for Rome immediately. Wait! There! She's sending signals. I should kill her now. But if she's not your hunter, youâ€™ll go to jail! Then she could be mistaken for a Sunsetter who's drowned herself. It's happened before. - Why hasn't she tried to kill you yet? - I don't know. But she's the only one following me. - No one else has attempted to kill me. - Maybe it's a strategy. The solution to the problem is the Temple of Venus. - She keeps insisting we go there. - Here's what we'll do. I'll go investigate there, then I'll meet you at Lidia's. - In an hour. - Fine. Why did you sign up for the Big Hunt? For the money, like everyone else... and because I think that life is too long. - Age? - Middle. - Profession? - All sorts. Are you married? - Are you familiar with the Sacred Rota? - No. It's the marriage court. Get married in Italy and you'll become familiar with it. Three days ago my marriage was annulled. I had been waiting for six years. - Will you remarry? - No, not even dead. - Why? - It's a past experience. Can't you see what it's done to me? So these family matters are the reason why you aren't defending yourself... and you've decided to die. Don't try too hard to understand it all at once. Could you at least tell me where you've brought me? To my wife's house. I have to take care of something. - A few minutes. - Heard that? A few minutes. Tell everyone to get ready. Hurry. Wait! I made it with my own hands, but now it's my wife's. Lidia! Light or very light music? A piano solo. - Care for an aphrodisiac? - Mild, if you have one. What are you doing? You keep them in a safe? No, I'm looking for something more stimulating, money. Damn her! Enough with this game. Serve yourself. Sorry, these sunsets exhaust me. I don't know what else to invent to make money. Three minutes of relaxation. What? We have to go to the Temple of Venus. Holy Mary, what a lovely creature! Come here! Want some coffee? - Maybe she's a spy. - She's no spy! It's okay, mom. I should've known you were a spy for the Elderly Collection Center. Marcello, don't hurt her! It's not true. I'm a journalist! What do I care about your parents? Everyone could use the reward. What do you need your parents for? I don't understand. Why haven't you handed them over to the state yet? In Italy, we believe in the patriarchal family. Hardly anyone hands them over. We hide them. - Often we disguise them as young people. - As young people? Incredible, such a strong filial bond. - You love them that much? - No, but my sense of duty bothers me. If you're not a government agent, then you must be my hunter. Well, decide. Come on, let's get it over with. Hurry, though. Why are you being so dramatic? How can you think that I'd want to kill you? I understand your situation: the hunt, the wife, the money. But if you want to win, you need to relax a bit. Don't get so worked up. It's not good for you. Want a massage? I'm good at it. How did you resolve the problem with your parents? I'm from Hoboken, from the center for artificial insemination. - You give a great massage! - Are you ticklish? - So you're very sensual. - A real tornado. How I envy you! Do we want to have this experience? Lie down. I don't feel a thing. You can even count to one hundred, I'm a block of ice. Yes, that's right. You have good technique... but I would need to take a course on soft erotica. But it's so demoralizing, especially the literary part. So many fall for it. Be quiet. If you keep talking, how can I work? Sorry to disturb you. Lidia, it's you. Stay, please. I'd like you to meet my wife, Lidia. - Ex-wife. - That's right. You could have at least warned me. You can't imagine what happened. Olga called me. I told her our marriage had been annulled. Did I make a mistake? You should keep your mouth shut. Now she'll start preparing the papers! Naturally, after so many years! You promised you'd marry her. You even forced us to become friends. - She's always here! - You two are the sick ones! I think it's sweet how much she wants to marry you. - Looking for something? - My prize money. I told you. I've already spent it. - All of it? - Of course. If I get remarried, I'II have to buy myself something. Plus I take care of your parents. Don't think it's a small expense. Two old people... Let's hand them over to the state. And who are you? So he's hiding here with you. Correct? He doesn't answer the phone. He won't speak about the annulment. What do you want from me? I've been waiting years for this annulment... and now you come along, thinking you can change my life! - I'II kill you! - There's been a misunderstanding! I put so much into this relationship. I was young when it started. Not in my house. Calm down. Stupid! Marcello says good-bye. He left. It's not a simple survey as she's trying to make you believe. I have a feeling they're plotting something strange. I think it's a trap. It's up to you, but be cautious. Wait for me here. Be careful! - Is this the Temple of Venus? - Yes. Thanks. - Did Caroline call back? - She's on her way back. Stall him. I was paid by one of your workers for an interview... but we lost track of each other. Can we do the interview without her? No, but I'm sure Caroline will be here any moment now. - Do you know anything, Martin? - I know she's supposed to be here. She's usually punctual. Seeing that you're not ready, I'II give you back the advance. If we can't do it now, it's not a problem. We're in no hurry. Right, Cole? Of course, we're always here. - Would you like a drink? - Have a drink with us. A whiskey? - Vodka? - Sambuca? If Signorina Caroline still needs me, she can find me at the Hunt Club. - She'll only be a few minutes. - Listen! The Hunt Club at midnight. Darn! Take a break! You're right. The TV interview is an excuse to bring me here and kill me for publicity. - A commercial. - Yes, sort of. Americans are always ahead of us. They're organizing something like this in Milan also. Silvestri's the only one who'd love an idea like this. - What idea? - I'II kill her for a product too. How can I organize it all in one night? I don't care. - That's what I pay you for! - But I haven't seen a cent in months! You're with me because it's worth your while. Let's go. Hardly. It'll be difficult in one night! I'd like to speak to the Chief. - Right away. - Thank you. We're lucky. He's in. Hello. Go ahead. I'm listening. It's attorney Rossi, Marcello Poletti's assistant. - The hunt! - Yes, exactly. I'd like to propose a great publicity opportunity for your product... including a pool, a crocodile... and the killing of an American girl. The idea of killing someone for publicity has always entertained me. I'm concerned about the fact that a woman will be killed though. - Why? - In Italy, this could be counterproductive. Insist. - Could we kill someone else? - It's impossible. This year female sacrifices are in style. It doesn't matter who dies, but how they die. These days people want entertainment. These days people are only looking for entertainment. True, but I need to think about it. We gave you the first offer, but we can't waste time. Yes or no! - Fine, come here quickly. - Very well! - Right away, though. - Okay. - He bought it. - Let's go. Make room. Let us through. Don't go near. It's dangerous. I take no responsibility. - A wonderful animal. - Yes. Come here, Poletti! Lovely, isn't it? Careful, place him down slowly. I hear heâ€™ll be eating a girl. Don't worry, he could eat three. - Are you sure? - Certainly. - It'll immediately crack her spine. - Perfect. - It has another amazing characteristic. - What? It's the only crocodile in the world that doesn't cry after meals. - Speed? - 80 km an hour in water. - Are you going to put it in water? - Not now, at the last minute. Tomorrow I'm going to Milan. We must finish shooting by tonight. - Okay. - You can count on it. Marcello, the contract! It's getting late. Put the crocodile in the gazebo for now. I'm missing a detail. What's the slogan you have to say? - Read it! - Let's see. "Upon killing the hunter, Caroline Meredith... I, the undersigned, Marcello Poletti... shall lift up the glass with said product... and state, after flashing an inviting smile, the following slogan: 'With Coca 80 you always win!"' Great. We're ready. Let's go. The advance! Signorina Caroline must sit here. - Are you sure it works? - Of course. - Let's try it out. - As you wish. You be the girl. - Actually, I... - Sit down there. We're sure the crocodile's not here? Come, the device is here. Stay calm, it's just a test! You just have to push this button. - Go ahead! - I beg you, Chief! Poletti, press the button. Go ahead. Caroline, I think he's not sure you're his hunter. Maybe he's suspicious. Then why did he leave me at his wife's house... and come to the Temple of Venus? He fled. He has a million problems, with those women tormenting him! You should know. One even slapped you in the face. He asked for me at the Temple of Venus, when he knew where I was. He didn't ask for you. He said he lost track of you. He even wanted to give us the money back. We can do whatever we want with him. We have him in the palm of our hands. He's too stupid. Yet I'm sure that as soon as he sees me, he'll shoot. It's forbidden. He can't shoot you at the Hunt Club. You can rest assured there at least. I'll go. Give me my clothes. We need to plan something to confuse him... and make him believe that someone else is his hunter. Gun! Chet, shoot at him but don't hit him. - Got it? - Okay. - Be sure he doesn't recognize you. - Of course. Pretend to be his hunter. - Understood. - Come, Caroline, let's go! I've got another idea. Find me a young attractive man too. HUNT CLUB - Hello? Chet here. Over. - Martin here. Over. Mission accomplished. What should I do now? I'm never going out with you again. I didn't fall for it. He was sent to mix things up. A hunter would not have missed at this distance. Caroline's probably arrived. You stay here and keep watch. - She's arriving with someone. - Someone else? Yes, he's not American. We don't have much time. The crocodile will be waiting at 4:00. Get out! You're a spineless coward! For your life, I wouldn't pay a cent. Should I consider myself free? As you wish! And the job at the Temple of Venus? You're too busy. I prefer Rudy. Maybe he's less interesting. Right, you're less interesting? But he's a much easier man. This way it's all taken care of. You can even keep the advance. Poor Marcello... wrapped up in his problems with women, wives, lovers... prey and hunters... And I thought you were the embodiment of the great savage man. - Why are you teasing me? - I'm not. - Disappointed? - Very. For a moment at your house, you gave me a glimpse of something new. Then your wife and that woman show up and you run away like a baby. I have a proposal for you. Maybe with a more romantic ambience... Come. I know of a villa on Via Appia Antica with an amazing pool. Let's go there! No. The spell is broken, don't you think? How cute! The crocodile. I like effeminate men. They're ideal friends for women. They're great company. Have you ever been like them? Why do you despise men so much? I really want to like them... but when that moment comes around, it's impossible. Where are you going? To work. To the Temple of Venus. - What happened? - She's interviewing that other guy. So it was a real interview. The Hunt had nothing to do with it. Maybe the hunter was actually the one who shot at you outside. Keep your guard up. I've been watching you all night. You two are falling in love. Ming Tea makes you love more! Only Ming Tea makes you love more! She has nothing to do with the Hunt. Maybe I was wrong. Think about it. This interview with Rudy could be fake. Women are sly. She follows you... pays you for an interview, you see her sending signals at night... and she does all she can to get you here! If you weren't 100% sure, why didn't you tell me immediately? How was I to know? It was just an intuition. The victim never receives precise information. Now what will we do about the crocodile guys? You took the advance. They are waiting for us. Find an excuse. Try to stall them. I have to be convinced before killing her. I'm the one risking 30 years in jail! Go away! Get out of here! - He fell for it! - Go! Why am I a spineless coward? Because you're afraid. Of who? Of me. Want to get in? Guys, come here! Come back! I'll follow them with the car. Quick! - Do you love her? - Who? - Olga, your lover. - No. Then why don't you tell her? It would make things easier. - Relationships require truth. - Who wants truth? No one likes the truth. Lies are much better. I blush when I tell the truth. You want the truth? Hold on. Hello? Hello, Olga. Where are you? I've been looking for you all day! Listen here. - Tonight I feel like being honest. - How come? Listen, my annulment has already been granted. - Lidia told me. - Yes. But I'm not going to marry you. If I find you, I'II make you pay for this. It's that American's fault! - I've waited for many years! - I said I won't marry you. I'll kill you! I'll buy a gun! There will be bloodshed! Now that I told the truth, where's my prize? What a stupendous night! I feel great. - Can I tell you something? - What? In New York, after a night like this... you put a coin in a machine... and people like us can become husband and wife. We're not in New York. Sorry, but let's make this clear. In Italy hardly anyone gets married. It's not worth it. We don't have divorce yet. We move in together. We're very religious. I want to have a child with you... even two or three! Darling, I could give you three, nine, ten! As many as you want, but no marriage. Don't joke around. It's the first time I've asked someone. Attention! Poletti and Caroline are right on track. I'll remain here. I feel like a normal woman here with you. A truck will drive over these. It'd better not sink! There will be a crane too. Let's go! This will be fine. Good morning, darling. - How long did I sleep? - Six hours. It's 11:00. Strange, I don't hear the sea anymore. The sea's settled down. You know what I was thinking? Why don't we go away, just the two of us? Far away from it all, on an island. Maybe you're right. I'm no good. I want to change. I must change! I don't believe you. You're a liar. And yet I can prove to you that I am telling the truth... That truth that you like so much. - Have I introduced you to Tommaso? - No. Tommaso, go to Carolina. Don't be afraid. Show her if I'm sincere or not. He's my only friend. Pick him up! Touch his nose. You'll see how affectionate he is. See how sweet he is? He's very sensitive. Open him. - There's a revolver inside. - It's mine. I have no desire to kill you. I love you. I want to live with you. I always knew that you were my hunter. - Really? - From the very beginning. What is it? Quick! This is fantastic! Ready, action. Drink Ming Tea, and youâ€™ll live longer. Good morning. You've prepared an amazing death for me! Youâ€™ll live longer. You're amazing! Why are you laughing? Because I am fascinated by your planning. Thank you. Move a little that way, please. Drink Ming Tea and youâ€™ll live longer! Of course, drink Ming Tea and you'll live longer. Drink Ming Tea and youâ€™ll live longer! Louder! This show has been brought to you by the Ming Tea Company. Fire! Don't hesitate. Shoot! Want him to run? Shoot! Shoot! Great! You were great! Wonderful! Now you're the "decaton". One million dollars! - Impressive. - Congratulations! Move it. Let's clear out. Let's not waste time. Hurry! We did it. Let's deal with the corpse. Cole! - Where did the dead guy go? - I don't know. I was over there. What? Forgive me. You shot me. It's not true that you love me. Don't move. I'm sorry. I really love you! It's too late. You're naive. You trusted my gun. When you're in love, you always make mistakes. - You think? - Yes. No, darling! I'm sorry. You're the only woman I could have loved. You didn't understand a thing. Congratulations! Perfect! Say the slogan. - Ten thousand dollars. - Okay. Smile! She made a mistake. She didn't drink a double dose of Ming Tea. Correct? The gun! The gun! Caroline, enough! Fine, I give up. I'm at your mercy. You're breaking my eardrums. Enough. Women never die. Damn, I should have guessed. I have skin armor, the only one of its kind... my personal invention. You can't kill me. It would be pointless without the TV here. It's for personal satisfaction. Take that! I'll strangle you. Marcello, this is your last hunt. I swear, I'll kill your parents too! - I'll kill you like a dog. - Quick, take cover! - Defend yourself! - What are you doing? Get off! It's that lunatic, Olga. There she is! Give it to me. You're good for nothing. Give me the rifle, or I'm going to get killed! Let go! - Damn women. - I killed your first victim! Dynamite in the boots was my idea! That's not true! - Yes, it was hers! - Coward! - I'll strangle you! - Stay down or they'll kill you. - Did they shoot you? - No, I dislocated my shoulder. - Let's get out of here! - Enough with the rifle! Don't waste time! Go! Come on, run! - Come on! - Wretches! Run, Marcello! Who are you? - You look like an ancient Roman. - I am! - What's your name? - Otello. - Are you a natural brunet? - Of course. - Olga, where are you? - Don't let her see us. She's crazy! Come with me. I want to tell you something. Me too! Welcome. Where are we going? Where are you taking me? I want to sleep. What is this? A wedding airplane? Crazy. I now join you in marriage. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Here we are. Do you, Caroline Meredith, want to marry Marcello Poletti? Yes. What did you say? - What? - Are you not Marcello Poletti? There's been a mistake. We're here by accident. I'd like to get off. - But you are Marcello Poletti? - Yes. Then you have to get married. How else did you expect to conclude this relationship? Caroline, you set this all up. Do you, Marcello Poletti, want to marry Caroline Meredith? Well... I'd like to think about it. No. You shouldn't think. You should just get married. That is the beauty of it. Here are the rings. Do you, Marcello Poletti, want to marry Caroline Meredith? I don't seem to have a choice. Yes. I now join you in marriage. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. You may kiss. Good luck. Why did you have to go and ruin this wonderful love story? THE END
