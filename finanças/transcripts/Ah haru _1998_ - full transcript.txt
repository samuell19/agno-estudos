He wasn't greedy It's like he knew when to give up If he'd been more aggressive he could've been president maybe even lived longer With him gone, though my life is a lot easier I sometimes feel guilty that he's not here to share the fun Everything was half measures His job, the family Well, he had his fun so cheers I saw you two going to play golf Did you? My husband really liked Hiroshi very much You were so honest and modest Just a country boy Your father died young didn't he, Hiroshi? Yes, I was five, so I don't remember what he looked like I rather envy you My father lived to 98 years old We got sick of the sight of each other Mitsuru, have you fed them? Not yet? You want to feed them with Daddy? I'll help you Excuse us It's a silly hobby keeping chickens like that As he said himself he's a country boy Mitsuru, here Let me in there Look, a freshly laid egg It's spring, that's when they lay a lot of eggs Little chicks will hatch Chicks? Then they'll grow up and lay more eggs They're nice and warm I've never chanted sutras to hens before A little souvenir for you They're delicious Not like supermarket eggs Well, thank you very much I'll wrap them for you Thank you I've stayed far too long I really must go now We appreciate your prayers Why don't we sing a song for father in heaven? When I first put to sea as a sailor man The mast was smashed and the sails all torn Mighty waves washed over the wooden deck But I'll not be troubled if it's here that I die Awaiting me is my lovely bride And my beloved parents who await me still More pills? Do you think I should go and see a psychiatrist Trouble sleeping again? No, not really I dreamed I was pregnant That's not funny It was just a dream Good morning You think too much I'd better get going Take care See you later You're up early today Come on, let's go and see your father off It's good buy Trust me, please I beg your pardon? Something less risky? Maybe convertible debentures? Oh, really? My sales are way down I need your business You could help me out... I see Certainly I'll set it up for you Thank you. Bye I made that man a millionaire! The buyers are getting a lot smarter No, our company is losing their trust Hello? Nirazaki from Nippo Security Yes, I've got an excellent buy for you Moodys are downgrading us it'll be in the newspapers soon That's the end of our company It'll take more than that Are you dreaming? They're already drafting articles about our bankruptcy Your brain only works at the office Do you ever talk to outsiders? No point in competing at a company that's going down the tubes I don't think it'll fail You're living the past Even banks are failing Look, we're in the same financial sector In this condition, who's going to buy our recommendations? Everyone's clawing like crazy to get out Central Bannk won't intervene Better start practicing crowd control How's Mizuho? What a question She's from a good family she relies on you, so get it together Why should you care? To tell the truth I've found a new job That was quick No, you're just too slow What about your clients? In days we'll be out in the street no time for them Think about your future No, I really mean it Is that you, Hiroshi? Is your name Hiroshi? Yes... What can I do for you? I knew it was you! You remember me? You don't, do you? I guess I can't blame you You were only five at the time But I can still see traces of you as a boy You're looking good I've been so eager to see you I really missed you Sorry I don't recall you I'm Sasaichi Hamaguchi! Don't you recognize your own father's name? My father?! My father died a long time ago Kimiyo told you that, eh? I was wrong to abandon you like that I often thought of coming back to see you Just never found the chance What was your name again? Sasaichi Hamaguchi I remember Mother did tell me that I searched everywhere and now I've found you. Good! Can you put me up tonight? Look, it's all so sudden I can hardly believe it I don't blame you I've got so much to tell you You'll soon come around Let's have a heart to heart Just you and me, son Sure... It's strange, he was supposed to have died ages ago That's what they said when you got married I'll go that I want to hear, too You were about 5 years old at the time My business went bust and I was heavily in debt To stop them getting the money from Kimiyo, we got a divorce These days I sell fishing gear down in Amasaki As I got older, I began to worry about you How did you find out where I live? Your mother had told her parents about you How you graduated and married into a good family I had a private detective search for you That was five years ago Five years ago? So you've know all this time? I was happy to hear you were alive and doing well Why didn't you contact me then? Knowing you were doing well was enough for me I'll get you a glass Ice, too So I closed down my shop I came to Tokyo I was eager to see you It'll be here a week can I stay till then? Daddy Mizuho come get him And you get into bed Got a son, have you? This is just too much Never thought I'd be sitting here drinking with my boy Delicious Is he staying the night? I can hardly throw him out into the street Is he really your father? You told me he was dead That's what I thought But one thing... Mother sometimes changed her story after she'd had a drink What do you mean? He is your father, isn't he? I really don't know You don't know? Then what should I do? Again, I don't know I have trouble comprehending he's my father I need time to think it over I can't believe it! For me? Thank you! Miss me? Of course I did It's getting harder to get a full truckload Of course he's not your father! Then who is he? Ignore him He's just there to sponge off you My bill Thank you He'll stay forever if you let him Get rid of him He's a practical man not like Hiroshi Is he really Hiroshi's father? I should ask him to repair the sliding door Watch out for the thorns My hands can take it At this time of year the branches are very flexible Cut them now and they'll shoot new branches and buds Bantams, aren't they? No, they're hens Hiroshi keeps them? He hated them when he was a kid Why is he suddenly so eager to see you now? I heard he was shacked up with a woman in Amasaki You knew all along? The folks in my hometown... were kind enough to tell me So...he really is my father Looks like he believes you're his son, too What does that mean? Just forget it Have nothing to do with him Mother, Shige should leave You've lost weight Are you eating properly? Of course I am Wake up! Shige! It's time to head out Thanks for reminding me Take care Look... He was absolutely hopeless He took half measures he was a quitter He started out as a deckhand on a freighter Then he became an auto-mechanic After that he borrowed money to buy a fishing boat He never stuck to any one thing for very long He was heavily in debt He wanted to use my money so I divorced him Then he went missing The man was a loud-mouthed braggart A woman chaser and a big spender No redeeming virtues at all So you killed him off and told me he died? Forget that Don't get involved with him He'll only create problems with Mizuho and her mother But if he is my father I can't just ignore him You should have called me first How's Mitsuru? I really miss him He must be getting big Hi there, how is it? Hello little brother What brings you here? Want a beer? No thanks. I must go Two glasses You really should see more of your mother Don't leave everything to us Sorry, I'm just so busy Sit down What's the news at work? The newspaper say your company's going under Well... times are tough During the bubble economy you swaggered about You're not swaggering now He'll be fine once the economy picks up Okay, I'll see you later But you don't have to worry, do you? You married into a wealthy family Right. See you later Get rid of him as soon as possible If you don't, it'll only lead to problems Begone ye devils! What did he want? I've no idea but it sounded important Why don't you put your foot down? He should share in taking care of Mom The diner can't last for much longer Not so fast I'm working on the franchise deal now Begone de devils! Grandpa! Are you okay, Grandpa? You must be exhausted Have a drink Stop it, Mitsuru That's enough It's over Welcome home What's going on here? Father was playing with Mitsuru He's been ever so helpful today He repaired the leaking bathtub And the door doesn't squeak any more He's been wonderful Come on, Hiroshi Let's have a drink Two, six, two Foul It sure is Yours are all fouls Six, one, six Six, six, one Do you know what he's teaching Mitsuru? Gambling! It's embarrassing enough that he turned up I want him out of here So why not tell him? What does Hiroshi say? He's always home late However late, you must talk this out The man reeks of alcohol Mitsuru, how about we have chicken stew for dinner? I already ate Look, I've tried to do my best for your father But I'm at my limit He taught Mitsuru how to play craps That's no big deal And your hen! Your hen... ... is fried chicken Welcome home You taught Mitsuru to gamble Sit down You remember I taught you craps? You've been here 10 days now Just a couple more days That's no end to that is there? Can you be packed and out by tomorrow? I'll throw in bullet-train tickets, too Who in hell do you think I am?

Unlike you, I can't change so suddenly Well, we're not getting any younger Getting old, are we?

Mr. President He didn't even mention it? What does ''file for protection'' mean? Are you serious?

''Just Guy'' Hey, I'll change my ways so please come back home I'm sorry I said you should earn your keep at your age I'm here to apologize I'm very sorry She's come all this way Haven't you? You reckon? How wonderful to have someone to share your twilight years I'll look after him We've been together 15 years like glue You can do as you like You can drink I won't complain any more I know what you're up to You insured me to the hilt then put me to work You're trying to kill me off You have no inkling of my feelings You've been gone a month I've realized how much I miss you Come back! I miss you You can hardly refuse such an appeal... Sweet words mask much She turned me into an alcoholic To get me on the slab that much quicker Meanwhile, she pockets the insurance It's enough to make the booze stick in your throat I'm busy I understand Alright then You want your son to take care of you then stay here Let me know when he dies I'll burn incense for him This is ridiculous... Take good care of him I gave my life to you I deserve the insurance! Good riddance! That's the end of that Sorry for the bother What a surprise! Who was that woman? He's back there again? How can I ever apologize? Yes, of course I'll be there tonight Alright, see you then Mother, are you going out tonight? Yes, I have some errands We wanted to talk to you about redistributing the property I haven't changed my mind It's me who set up and ran this shop You can take over when I receive what we agreed to Then you can change it to a pinball parlor or a motel You can do as you please He certainly has a nerve that man I told Hiroshi that he had died He's only brought trouble for Mizuho and Hiroshi To think he was my husband of 30 years ago, I could sink through the floor Please Hello, Hiroshi What brings you here? Leave everything to me Father, if you don't mind Mother wants to talk to you What? Are you Kimiyo? You are, aren't you? Don't look at me like that Long time no see, Sasaichi This is a surprise I'm dumbfounded You've gotten old There's something that I must tell you I realize that you're not happy with this arrangement But all I've got left is Hiroshi He's my only son, he is I am sorry but you're really not Hiroshi's father There's no blood link at all You're complete strangers Wait... Mother! But he really isn't your father Minoru Kataoka is What did you say? A year before Hiroshi was born that tuna fisherman, Kaikichi asked you to work for him You went off to Australia didn't you? During those 6 months that you were away... I fell pregnant with Minoru's child I did a good job of fooling you But the truth is that Hiroshi is really Minoru's son There were rumors you could have heard about it What does that make me? You needn't worry Minoru is a man I longed for when I was young So kind, a real hunk and a leader of the young men's association So... ...so that's the story I'm sorry to upset you but that's what happened So that's what happened? So, Minoru is... My husband passed away 3 years ago I really have no choice If you take Hiroshi what's left for me? He's all I have left Okay, I understand Well I can't stay here can I? Hiroshi, I'm sorry about all this Well, there's no hurry You can stay longer we've no objections Now I know the facts I have to go You just forget all about me Thanks for everything Father! Ambulance! Call an ambulance! Come in Why did you wait until he was critical? Is it that bad? It's terminal cirrhosis with extreme complications If he has another attack he could die I doubt he'll pull through I understand I appreciate it, Doctor Mom, the hen has laid more eggs! Really? We'll take them to Grandpa Will they make him better? Yes Really? Yes, dear Put them in the basket Here Freshly laid Just this morning Put them over there Certainly I brought some radish relish You like it, don't you? And some soup, too Don't worry about me It wasn't much trouble Grandpa, a picture for you They're just leftovers Hang it up there Leaving your washing out I want you to do me a favor What is it? I'd like some sake No, you can't A small bottle will do I can't do that The doctor will be furious and after all, this is a hospital So just forget all about drinking! Even if he isn't your real father he took care of you as a boy So let's do what we can for him But that costs money I have savings I can pay the hospital bill You've never lacked for anything Maybe so but please You've never known hardship Morning has broken Dawn has come No matter what they say a man needs a drink That's the truth Hearts bursting with pride... The pride of men who go to sea Okay, cut it out! The staff are furious with you They'll kick you out if you don't stop now We'd better go You take care of yourself Cover up I was but a lad of fourteen years When first I put to sea as a sailor man The first time our ship cleared the port The mast was smashed and the sails all torn Mighty waves washed over the wooden deck But I'll not be troubled if it's here that I die That song... It's our song, lad When first I put to sea as a sailor man The mast was smashed and the sails all torn Mighty waves washed over the wooden deck But I'll not be troubled if it's here that I die Awaiting me is my lovely bride And my parents more important to me Neptune beckons me... I really am your son after all As Kimiyo says I might be infertile Offer up prayers and make your vows To Neptune the King of all Seas Mighty Neptune will you quieten the storm? For just a little while for just a little while I wonder how he is? Well... I visited the hospital today but he was fast asleep He's like that recently The man's nuisance whether he's sick or well It's too bad What are you doing? Shall I make a snack? Listen... Look... I must apologize to you What for? The company's restructuring plan was rejected That means they're bankrupt You only ever give results It was all so sudden You never discuss anything You never have You turned your back on your own father Selfishly thinking only you've suffered Maybe you're right Did I really enjoy my work? There'll be no final payment I don't know what to do Hello, Nirazaki residence It's the hospital! Your father's dying! Take the call We should've contacted you earlier I never knew if he wanted to live or not My sincere regrets Let's go Let's go home Little chicks! This is incredible! He said he would try to hatch them And he did it! He didn't eat those eggs He nurtured them Who would ever have imagined? Father... Spreading his ashes, how sad I bet he's happy He loved a ceremony I wonder... I never saw the body so I keep expecting him to turn up If he did, would you insure him again? Don't say that! I was good to him It was such a short time... You seem to be getting younger Really? Do you think so? Shall we begin? I suppose we must Will normal funerary prayers do? Anything, I suppose Great God of Compassion... Ashes to ashes Dust to dust Doesn't Hiroshi take after him? You lied, didn't you? I'll keep a piece of him Which bone was it? I'll have to find a new job Don't worry Life will go on You know, I'm quite strong Even so it's a long haul... Mitsuru! You've got a strong mother!
