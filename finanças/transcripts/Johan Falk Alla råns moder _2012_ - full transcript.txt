MOTHER OF ALL ROBBERIES Swedish troops in Afghanistan battle. EU summit on new crisis countries. New sports complex to be built in Stockholm. For the third time in a month Swedish troops... - Engineer Arthur J?nsson? - That's right. - Where is the kitchen? - What? Here. Look what we have here. - Are you from the police? - Take it easy. I want to see identification. Has the office sent you? Come here. Do as we say and there won't be any trouble. The question is if this is the calm before the storm or the start of something new. Good morning, Inspector. Can I take the paper? Are you okay with Ola? Where's the paper? Bill took it. - Has he started sleeping over? - I must go. The signs from the print shop were all wrong. - Will you give Orjan a key? - Do we want him here? He said the attic look like hell. Neither I nor the surveyor saw anything wrong. Take it up with Orjan. He's here now. I thought I'd invite Bill to dinner. Nina will probably be pleased. I'm ready. It wasn't that bad. If you hadn't been so stubborn, you wouldn't have been hurt. Let's get some air. We've earned it. Arthur, concentrate on the house over on the right. - Which house? - Over there on the right. God damn it, you son of a bitch! Shout louder so everyone can hear and see you. Put those drawings back. I didn't think we were going to kill him. What should we do then? You don't think he would call the police? An old security man. Grow up, kid. Look, he locked the door from the inside, after he jumped. Talented guy. - I know it's my week... - Listen to me! Tuesday we have training. You were on driver training just recently. Should I say,"I can't train for night- shooting because my girls need a drive?" But, my God... What's important, Sophie? Fuck you. Are you even working on Tuesday? Hello! Let me look at you. What clothes! Real smooth. Nobody wants to do business with a loser. That's true. But clothes aren't everything, even if they say it. - Is everything arranged? - Yes. Neat. You need to set some priorities. I have my own list. Buy some Chinese food and I'll see you at home. - We're supposed to... - We'll talk at home. Good to see you. I wasn't expecting applause, but you look completely squashed. - What is it? - Sometimes you have to work with idiots. All right. Thank you. We'll joke with my brother. Drive like hell. What the hell...! Drive, damn it! Automatics. White VW: FSO 067 M?rsta Rentals I'll call you back. Both Vans are yours. The weapons are in the trunk of the burgundy one. Here, take them. We'll come back at midnight, so we don't lose the weapons. Be on time. Good job. Maybe your brother is to be commended. He's talented, but he works for me. I control everything. That may be worth remembering. Will old Kalashnikovs be enough? Otherwise, I have a nice AK5 and AK5C, with or without mortar. You mean a grenade launcher located underneath? - Yes. - I'll be damned. Kalashnikovs are good. They'll still do the job. - When do I get the cash? - Two days, as we said. Good. Hey. The white VW was rented with fake ID. The rental company is emailing surveillance video as soon as they can. Must be a record! The bastard was out two minutes... before he ended up in a stolen car. Let me have the photo of the person who rented the car. Service Tunnel Fr?lunda Square Shopping Centre The one worked there before was prettier than the one who came later. Off! Turn it off! - Hell! - Put your hands up! Now! Stop! Stay calm! Do not move. Show me your hands. - Both hands! Now! - Fire in the hole! Don't move! Don't move! 85 seconds. Good. And when the hell do you use it? - Okay. Was anyone injured? - No. Ouch... Ouch, ouch! All right. - Do we know how many there were? - We'll check. Robbery in Fr?lunda Square. Major Crimes is involved. Hey! It's me, the cute one. Well if you call back... Patrick, check this! The latest Intel from the robbery at Fr?lunda Square. "According to the guards, the robbers filmed everything... " "including the damage from explosives. " - Why film their own robbery? - Quality assurance for next time. Next time? I know that look, Johan. Let the Major Crimes Division handle this. Hey. Should we remove the barricades? - Ask Forensics. Why haven't you called me? Bad luck! Two traffic tickets. And still, you park in the middle of a precinct. - Why haven't I called? - Yes. You planted my DNA in a ski mask. So that I'd be so shit-scared I'd come crawling to you. One can see from the deposits in that hair... that it was only a few weeks old. I've checked it. And the robbery you tried to frame me for, was committed... when was that? 1997? That's 14 years ago. Oops. Was that so hard now? Consider what happens to cops who end up in jail for entrapment. Can you handle that? Don't worry about me. I don't snitch. I never snitch. Not even on a cop. Can I give you a tip? With the best of intentions. You should chill out a bit. You seem so damned uptight. I don't know why... I'll just help you. So. Beautiful woman! It's much softer released. The other way is so severe. That's cute. ?hstr?m! Good. Should we move that stuff now? There you are! Fr?lunda Square. The guards said they could neither receive or call out. I was there. Perfect reception. Lunch! Matte checked mobile calls made at the time. There were none. None at all. They must have used a jamming device. Explain where to find the link to organized crime. Give info to Major Crimes. The vegetarian is Sophie. What a place. It would be great to live here. You could enjoy yourself like a prince in a baker's shop. You can have the new weapons on Monday. When would you like to have the truck and the van? As soon as possible, no later than five days. Then we'll settle up. 160 for the previous job. 40 in advance for the last one. Last? You mean the next. We're not going to stop now? It will be the last one. I promise you. We'll take the AK5s. They're more reliable. Should we shoot them next time? We'll see. Cheers! Can I come down now? Why don't you trust me? Does it feel like I don't trust you? Yes. Okay. I'll give you more to do. All right. You should hang out more with the gang. Otherwise, they'll lose respect for you. Who's losing respect? Never mind. Just be aware of it. Who? Is it Victor? Conny? Or Alm, talking shit in jail? Who's losing respect? And Frank? Did you get a hold of him? Is it so hard to call Frank Wagner? He doesn't answer. I only get a foreign dial tone. Oh well, that sounds brilliant. It worked out well, taping the camera to the gun. - Hey. - Hey. Thank's for that. It went well. Funding for Phase 2, and good info. - A progress report? The next batch of vehicles in five days. - Elomaa? - The plates come in tomorrow, from Poland. And Larsson? The AK-47s have been destroyed. I'm getting new ones. - Will they be AK5s? - Yes. - How did you do it? - A good contact. Good. I'll check that they work. Good. Elomaa and Svensson, take us through the details of the home visit. We compared the old man info with the armoured truck film. It seems correct. It's the same manufacturer. Mind you don't scratch his nice car. International business law. It sounds exciting. It's pretty dull, but it'll be more fun when I start working. Nice car you have. Expensive? Dad always said there are two kinds of people. What then? Those who get things to be someone else... and those who do it to be themselves. The old man always saw things in black and white. I don't remember much of him. Hello, in the middle of dinner? Done for the day. Nina, we'll see you next weekend. Absolutely. - Orjan is Nina's father. - We met at the birthday party. I'll call and let you know what I found. Tell us now. Do you want something? - No, I have to go. The power lines are lying on top the insulation in the attic. Yes, on top. Condensation in the sheathing can catch fire anywhere. We'll pull out all the lines and reposition them under the insulation. I'll bring an electrician tomorrow. Can you get me a couple of signs to...? - I have some other colleagues who... - Absolutely. Good. Then we're even. - Bon appetite. - Hey! Not strictly legal, right? Exchanging services between companies in private. Well, I don't know... - Good morning, Matte. - Good morning. Will you check out a guy for me? I think he's a felon. Here's the plate number on his car. - WILD-23? - Yes. What is it? If this isn't enough, we'll put it aside. Three jammers have been stolen from National Defence in the past four years. One in Afghanistan one in Kosovo and one... - In Gothenburg? - Probably a former officer. G?ran Svensson, born in '77. The clown got two years for grand larceny in 2009. He had a Land Rover with jamming antennas parked in his garage. Now it gets really interesting. The jamming transmitter was never found. A stolen Land Rover in his garage? What a fucking airhead. I compared Svensson's registered cell phone... with other prepaid numbers used at the same cell tower lately. It gave an unregistered prepaid number he probably uses. If we compare the numbers of other prepaid phones he called... we find a common denominator among the subscriptions. All the phones are turned off a few times a week north of town. They shut down both their official and their prepaid phones. Then we have the identity of the others. They're all professional officers or former officers. - All served together abroad. - Afghanistan. - Elite Soldiers? - Usually officers. All on long-term sick leave for PTSD. You want to see organized crime. Where did G?ran Svensson serve his sentence? Who was he best friends with? How the hell would I know? Seth Rydell. Sophie. The picture was in my email this morning. From a car rental firm in Stockholm. - It was G?r... G?ran... - Svensson. ...Who rented the car with fake ID and picked up Seth Rydell from prison. Is it enough for the boss? If we take this over from Major Crimes, it had better not go wrong. Attach a tracker to Seth's car, but wait with the military. We already put a tracker there. Last week. Sophie wanted to. He turned off towards G?rdsl?sa. He turned off towards G?rdsl?sa. Thank you. Niklas, you're a psychologist. How can you tell if someone is a psychopath? A true psychopath? You can't. You can't. Does that apply to all psychopaths? No, but if you mean a real psycho... He turned off towards G?rdsl?sa. If we're talking about the universal, populist definition... everyone's a psychopath. - There! Want to look? - No. I trust you. Hold it, listen up... Come, Viktor. How's it going? Good. I've been away for a while. Almost three years. It's a long time. It's easy to forget who's pulling the strings. Don't. That would be the wrong attitude to have. Right? - Right? - Sure. Good. Now they're leaving. They're taking Gjutj?rnsgatan east. He's heading for Backaplan. He's met two people, and dropped off a large heavy bag. It's been put in the back seat of a Pontiac Firebird. Got it. Anyone you know? One is Svensson, the other is probably Larsson. Larsson's plate number is Tore, Urban, Bertil, 136. That's correct. Okay, Niklas, go to Larsson's home. Here they come. Larsson and Svensson. Svensson's going east. Larsson's walking to his door. He has the bag with him. A dark gray sports bag... - with two beige, vertical stripes. - Got it. When he leaves home as usual, we'll do one of our special jobs. - The subject is leaving without the bag. - 11. Understood. 11 and 10 are going in. Vidar, stay with the subject. - Niklas, stay away from the residence. He's parked at the turnaround on Krokilv?gen. Got it. Well, I'll be damned. He's disappeared into the woods on a small bicycle. Creative bunch. I'll relieve you in an hour. It looks like he turned off his phones. - 01to 90. Your 80? -01, 90 is at Polstj?rnegatan. Go up to Tunnbindaregatan 6 Water leak. Superintendent requests assistance to go into the apartment. That was pretty quick. I closed the valve, but the water is still running. Police. We need to look around in here. - I was sitting on my couch... - Do you want to come in and look? I was sitting in my apartment, and the water was running down the walls. - Damn. - Contact the insurance company. The cuckoo is on the way back now. - Got it. We're ready here. - Yes. - A really tough place to live. - Yes. Here you go. - Have you had time to check everything? - No, not yet. - Check this out! - What? - Holy shit. - Well, I'll be... Police! What are you smoking? I can't borrow from the company's tax account. - Why so much? - Take a look at this place. The bank is howling about a compulsory sale order. I have half but I need another 90 grand. - Take a payday loan, like you usually do. - I can't take a payday loan. - You can only get up to 3000. I'm joking. Oh, funny! Hey. Hey. - Tough job without Frank? - Don't mention that pig. He pulled in the dough. And he was nice. See you on Sunday, baby. One night and one more night. Bye, Mamma. See you later. You can borrow 50,000 and take Luna every second week. For the whole week. Then I can work more. The rest you can borrow from your friends. I can't babysit every second week. How's the truck and the van? - Everything is ready. And the pallet lifter? - Everything's ready, I said. - Good, good! "The accused officer refuses to speak at the hearing. " Of all the houses around, only Larsson's place flooded, and his flat was below it. He didn't count on the bad luck of someone doing a search. Bad luck or not, I don't like that kind of coincidence. Their prepaid phones from last night. Between 5 and 7 pm. Then their official phones were turned off. They moved around constantly, but stayed for 18 minutes here, at Lundbyleden. Another armoured truck hold-up in the tunnel? Yes. Or a diversion. Shutting down one of the tunnels will create chaos. Then they continued up to here, where all the phones were turned off. We'll watch that area tonight. There are only 12 houses, so it's pretty quiet. We'll have helicopter support, and our honorable chief will co-ordinate. According Matte all phones in the area have been turned off. 10 understood. Object Adam is cycling towards Erik 5. Got it. The heat activity between houses Erik 5 and Filip 6. - Got it. - We're returning to S?ve to refuel. I'll get closer. Vidar, this way. Damn. The house at Erik 5... A light upstairs and black cardboard on the windows. - Got it. Move closer. - Got it. We need a replacement for Larsson. It has to be someone we can trust. If we had someone like that, they'd be here already. The people I trust are in this room. What is it? I have an idea. I'm not really sure. For half a billion it's worth the risk. Yeah, I know... - It feels unprofessional. - Keep it to yourself.. You won't believe this. Half a billion? You must have heard wrong. Only the Riksbank has... ...that much money. I'll call you later. Riksbank? That's like a fortress. Yes. The only weak link their transport. I'll inform county police, will you contact Riksbank. I'm glad the prison guards had such respect for you. It was practical. You get help where you can find it. One other thing... Are you looking for a job? What kind of job? That last thing you talked about? Can you weld and drive a truck? Well, welding... I took the truck driver's course 15 years ago. But I haven't driven since. Good enough? It's only as a spare driver. We need people to carry. I've already suggested you. - For what? - A robbery. A big fucking robbery. - I need to know more. - No, you can't. Not until I know you're with us. - We need four AK5s. - I can arrange that. One of them is expensive. It's the one with a grenade launcher. A grenade add-on. That's cool. Is it a big job? - Eight people? - No, four, with you. Do they know who I am, what my name is? - No, no. - Good. Let's keep it that way. I don't trust you to keep your mouths shut if you're caught. That's why. That's the deal if I join you. Want a beer? You get 20, if you're in. Twenty? I don't get out of bed for that! - What's so funny? - 20 Million. - What? - 20 Million. Is that enough to get out of bed? It could be. Bank of Sweden, Southern Region Thanks for meeting with us so quickly. Unfortunately, I'm on my way to Stockholm. Sorry? Our retired Chief Engineer Arthur J?nsson will be buried tomorrow. - Sad. - Yes. What's on your mind? We have information that someone plans to rob one of your shipments. Yes. As security chief, you may want to know, so you can do something about it. Yes, but you must have more than that? When, where, how, what? Maybe? The fact is, we don't. The guy who was inside with Svensson, what was his name? - What? - Only Svensson knows his name. If he's as ruthless as Svensson says, maybe he'll take the money afterwards. Svensson describes him as a gangster. Maybe it's okay if I... ...take care of him afterwards. Since when did you ask permission? It's good to have a guy like that. We don't even know how to steal a car. No. We're not good thieves! We get a couple of tips a month, but so far nothing has happened. We are quite confident the information is correct. - And I'm trying to be very diplomatic. - Yes, but you must understand me too. We need more than this to change our routines. I can tell you that the truck in which the banknotes are transported... makes Barack Obama's limousine look like a soapbox. 17:34:12. Any attempted hijacking will trigger the destruction of the banknotes. Can you give us a hint how much you carry? Never more than three billion. Twelve pallets. Three billion? If you manage to get into the cargo area... Each pallet... has a GPS transmitter. You have to find every GPS transmitter... among all those cubic meters of banknotes. I think you can sleep well. Why makes you think we sleep well? Three escort cars. The escort chief sits in the one... directly behind the money. He's a pro. -17.35.22. - Got it. A two kilometer tunnel gives 92.7 km/h Good. That bastard is no Chris Amir. But I don't know what snitches you've had. It may work out anyway, right? He's a monster, Sophie, with a gang of obedient fools under him. You know he's killed people. Even his own. So tell me, do you have full control of what your infiltrators do all the time? - Huh? - I don't understand. Oh, come on. Frank is dangerous. Everyone knows that. If it were possible to control informants, what are we doing here? Sophie, Frank shot into Tommy's armoured vest, he didn't kill him. It was the other guy who shot him. Frank shot at the vest intentionally. So he's not a cop killer. Are you absolutely sure? Trust me. Frank plays the psychopath, Seth is a psychopath. A fucking difference. Respects, dear friend. But you're right. We should try. - Put the cover on and tighten the screws. - Thanks, Dad. She'll be alone with that psycho. If anyone can do it, it's Sophie. - Yes, but... - What? What's the problem? Hey! - What is it? - Okay, let's do it. Well, little Miss DNA. Which words didn't you understand last time? - What if Felix had opened the door? - 1. He's at the bar. 2. You cleaned up since yesterday, when G?ran Svensson was here. 3. You turned off the radio on the way to the door. - Turned off the radio? - Yes. Walther 9 millimeters. Some careless buddies must have forgotten it. - Nice place you have here. - Yes. Now you've seen it, fuck off. You won't get away from me that easily. Perhaps it's you who won't get away. If you don't start working for me I'll lock you up for three to five years. Plus the conditional part of your previous sentence. - You're both beautiful and stupid. - Shut up and listen! The armoured truck robbery at Fr?lunda Square. What you're planning for the Riksbank shipment. You got the AK5s we found at Fredrik Larsson's. We know you're mixed up with the robbery. Your little brother is involved; so we'll take him too. What kind of Riksbank shipment? I don't understand. You have 20 seconds to give us some answers. Flash your headlights three times. That guy out there will be your backup handler. Only we will know your identity. Give it up! I cannot and will not be your snitch. It's not going to happen. Your 20 seconds is up now. - Do I have a choice? - Not anymore. - I have to take it. - Go ahead. Yes. No, you're not interrupting. I said I'd take Luna next week. Yes. What do you doubt? Natascha, I don't have time for this. Not now. Fuck what I do. Keep your end of the deal. I'll keep mine. I've said so. There is just one number in this. You can only call that number. Charger. Always have it on. I'll call tomorrow afternoon, so we'll see. Oh, right... I'll give you this, Seth. It looks much better unbound. How did you know he was involved in the robbery? I took a chance. Seat belt. - You've been with GSI three years, right? - Two years and eight months. - How long were you undercover? - 865 Days. Before that National Police, overseas service for three years in Afghanistan. - Before the Police Academy, psychology and law school. I'm just a regular a cop from Skovde, have been since I was 20. What about Johan? He's cute. But not my type. I know you want to sleep with him. You said yourself that he freaked out in Germany when it heated up. So... Do you trust him? There's Svensson. Goggles. Don't see those every day! - Is it stolen? - Yes. These are from my contact. Our new member. A CSR with grenade launcher. Don't see those every day either. - Okay, a function check. - I have to try it. - I saw movement in the window. - The toilets are probably down there. Shall we take a walk? That sounds good. - Fine dining. - Magical. Smoke? - What's going on? - An infra-red light in the woods. - Police? - No idea. We can't take any chances. We'll switch to the alternate plan. Okay. The subjects are leaving the house, heading for the road. The back! Sit in the back seat. Is this inconvenient? When it's time to move, we'll fake a drug bust and grab you. The holdup cannot go ahead. We'll arrest the others for intent. The evidence against you won't be enough. So you'll skate and become a hero to your guys. Then you'll be compensated by the State for two weeks in jail. It sounds a little too simple. How do we avoid suspicion for example from Svensson? A car chase. You try to escape from us we force you into a ditch... and you get a good beating. Oh, great. - Are you serious? - Consider it a perk. For us. We're meeting tomorrow for a rehearsal. Okay. Thanks. Where and when is the holdup? If you know so much, why don't you grab them all now? And let them avoid a long prison sentence? Are you naive, Seth? The plans have changed and you can't be involved. I've killed for your sake. - Doesn't that mean anything? - Yes, very kind. You can help me with something important to the job. You can help me with Luna. - Help you with Luna? - Yes. I can't tell Natascha our arrangement has gone to shit in the first week. It's just a couple of hours tonight. A couple of hours, please, Felix. Hey? I looked up the guy with WILD 23. Okay. No trace of a criminal record... But I googled him. I found a photo from a classic car club. He's had cars since he was a kid and fixed them. He's a nerd. But that's not illegal. - Are you keeping an eye on him? - Johan! - We're moving. - Thanks. Through Sophie, we know the robbers are rehearsing this afternoon. Johan and Sophie will take the Lundby tunnel... the rest will follow Lundstr?m to try and figure out the escape route. - Lundstr?m's leaving the house. - Got it. He's getting into a red Volvo 440. Plate number: Adam, Tage, Sigurd 129. I'd bet my new article in Modern Psychology... that's Elomaa sitting next to him. Got it. Cute. Did you bring hot dogs, too? This is where the phones were detected for 18 minutes. They were also at the other entrance... but only for a short time. Have you heard anything from... Hj?rdis? No, but he promised to call when they're ready. The glass is broken. We can not... Are you ready? The car's over here. Do you want something to eat? The monkey is smarter than the lady Niklas, I'll drive between you and the Volvo. They're heading for G?ta tunnel. Is that something new? They took route 155 before to Lundby tunnel. I'll turn off and rejoin them on the other side. Johan and Sophie have nothing to report from Lundby tunnel. There are no parking spots on the east side of the tunnel... except at the service station... and that's exposed. They may have been there when they were spotted earlier. We parked 400 meters away on a forest road. 01, this is 13. The Volvo has been abandoned in G?ta tunnel. Got it. - Did you see anyone nearby? - No but here are several exits. God damn it! This is our day labourer. We'll call him Stefan. - What should I call you? - You can call me Chief. Hey, boss. They've left nothing to chance. They stopped at an emergency exit into the other tunnel. Damn... It feels so weird having Hj?rdis there. Hj?rdis? After my grandmother. Niklas and Vidar, we are moving towards the west end of Lundby tunnel. Sophie and Johan remain at the east end. -13 Understood. - Hey... what I said about Tommy and Frank... - Forget it. You weren't to know. - Want some? - No thanks. Where did you do military service? KA3. As a radio operator. - A real warrior. - Do we have a problem? - Don't you have anything better? It's lively. - We're leaving in ten minutes. - Yes. Why are we taking all this stuff if we're just practising? You don't get it, do you? Turn it down. - The brakes feel spongy. - Now you're just bitching. You whine constantly. Did your wife cut you off for a year? What if I bitch because she didn't cut me off? The brakes feel weird. Lill-Gnistan has checked their red Volvo, and it is completely empty. Not even a candy wrapper on the floor. Thanks, Matte. 01, 12 and 13 in position at the west entrance. No sign of the subjects yet. We'll pull-in at a parking space. Hey, check it out. If it's them, they're damned meticulous. It's a full-scale exercise. Or it could be a truck driver taking a piss. Let's go! Two welds on every emergency exit. We'll do both sides. We'll do both side, just in case. - The left tunnel entrance. - What are they doing? It's not Seth. Subjects seen inside the east entrance. They have a truck. Two of them, wearing yellow road crew jackets. It doesn't add up. Seth... I mean Hj?rdis, told us too much for the robbery to be happening now. If he's participating, it must be a rehearsal. Put yourself in his place, "For this many millions, I'll betray the lady." What would you say if you wanted it, but the cops were watching you? - Johan, is it time to strike? - Seth knows what he's gotten into. Maybe he's just as suprised as us. They haven't told him everything. Sophie, I can't contact Johan. Are we going in? I don't believe the robbery is happening now. - 01 To 10, come in. - Okay. 11 To all, we'll wait. - Got it. - Why aren't we going in? The brakes don't feel good. Tell the escort leader... that he should stay well back from us or farther out in front. Oskar 1, Oskar 4 Listening. The brakes are bad. The escort car should stay farther ahead or behind us. Okay, we'll remain behind you, so be careful going down the slope. - Did you see that behind the tree? - Where? On the slope by the service station. It looks like Elomaa. Where's he going? Elomaa is above the tunnel. He's disappeared into the trees. Here comes the Riksbank transport. Entering the tunnel now... escorted by three black Volvos. Didn't they just clean here last week? What the hell... Stop! Is he turning into the tunnel? Look at the case. God damn, it's going down! Hell, no signal. That's a cell phone tower. Take cover! Get the civilians out! - Do you have cover? - No! Get back! What the hell...? - Get back! - Get them out of here! Take cover! Get back! It worked. He's my brother. He's with us! Without him it wouldn't have worked. - Your partner? - He's knocked out. I've disabled the inking system and explosives according to plan. Head to the emergency exit! It's locked! It's locked! Fuck! Back! Fire in the hole! Back in the tunnel! Get back! Get back! Two minutes. - There's reception here. - Emergency. Robbery in progess in Lundby tunnel. - The Riksbank transport. - Riksbank transport? - Yes! Send everything you have. - Let's get moving. 01 to 10. What's the situation, please. A White van drove into the east tunnel entrance. No traffic coming out. Cell tower blown up, plus probable jamming of police frequencies. We've warned traffic away from the scene. We must drive against the traffic flow. Got it. The robbery is close to your end. We can't get through. The traffic is backed up here. It must be stalled in the tunnel. Three minutes. Yes, come on! The lead in the sheets will neutralize the GPS transmitters, so put them on. Throw on the sheets. Let's go! Grab this. Next sheet! Damn. The nearest road? Right here, left, then right again. - Did you say left? - Yes. Goddamn stupid old bastard! Stand still! Show your hands! - Don't move! - Shoot him, you fucking fool! Goddamn... I'm hit. - G?ran, G?ran, it's me. Come on! It went through the vest. What are you doing? Take the gun and leave him. Let's go. It went through the vest. - Damn. - Hurry up! 10 and 11 arriving at the service station. No response. There's no reception here. - Damn! - That case is the jammer. The stairs! Police! What if he was in on it. Huh? What if he's deceived us the whole time? I'll kill the fucking bastard. You've really dropped me in the shit. - You waited too long to strike. - It was my decision. - Are you blind? - I see everything you see. And? - We do our job. Do you have confidence in them? - How long are we staying here? - 'Til things calm down. A few days. We have clean clothes, a well-stocked fridge. Cold beer. The escape truck was found at the harbor. They're probably in the archipelago, north or south. The Coast Guard estimates... with all their boats, and with helicopters, their's and our's... it would takes two months to scour all the islands. Even longer to search on foot. This must be the first time robbers have taken billions and got away with it. Get those bastards. I don't care how... nor does the police chief. Just do it. Thank you for coming. We'll update you on the latest... If we don't solve this we'll be hung in the town square. I'm not kidding. Has anyone been through this before? An infiltrator we can not trust. - An informer. - Call it what you will. Now he's in there, undercover. Or he has his own agenda. Or both. We need to fucking fix this. What is it? - Huh? - What is it? - What's with you? - What's with me? Quit, if you don't trust the bosses. You can quit. This isn't the military, it's the police No, I won't quit. Someone else might want to do it. Listen all of you! We have received a report from the forensic technicians. Analysis shows 7 of the bullets which hit the security guard... came from a 2.23-calibre rifle. A 556 or an AK5. And three came from a 9-millimeter Walther. - Walther? - Yes. It's German. I know what that is. The rifling from the barrel identified it. Almost everyone else is working on this case, so let's do this. Dig up all the robbers, their mothers, fathers, girlfriends, sisters... Find something that links someone to the archipelago. Let's go back three years. If necessary, go back to the last century. Or the archaeology records. The limit is the rock carvings at Tanumshede. Is that mine? - Yes. - We only got one pallet. - A deal is a deal. Twenty million, in used notes. - And the poor guy up there? - Shush... He'll be fine. He's been asking for you... Stefan. How will I take everything with me when you let me off? And how will you manage the rest? We have a boat on another island. A 24-metre Wally. It'll take us where we're going. - I'll go up and see him. - Gunshot wounds and alcohol don't mix. It thins the blood. Sad. How's everything? The morphine helps. The boss is good at nursing, but worse at lying. This kind of gunshot wound won't heal itself. I need surgery. Otherwise... If you end up in hospital, they'll uncover everything... and set the wheels in motion. Better to go to prison... than to die. Do you know what feels worse? It's my mother. Explaining to neighbours and friends. "My boy robbed the Riksbank, but he's really very nice." Your mother's right. You're kind. A little too kind. - Stefan, we need to talk. - About what? Svensson. We'll leave him on the island. He'll die if we take him. So, he ends up in hospital and gets 20 years in prison. Serves his time. The money is waiting for him. Everything is hunky-dory. But if he doesn't keep his mouth shut? It doesn't matter. Where we're going there's no extradition treaty. If you have money. I'm talking about me, staying in this country. Svensson never said who you are. That was the deal. - I don't think he'll say anything. - You don't think... - We thought we'd have a barbecue. - And reveal our position with smoke signals. There are thousands of islands here. With a hundred barbecues per island.. No one will think we'd dare barbeque. Then we'll leave tomorrow. My mother was an amateur psychologist and Dad some analytical ADHD fanatic. Funny. And your story? As I said, I had over-protective parents. I wanted something dangerous, so I joined the military. Now I'm just a regular guy who's bitter after 28 years of service to the state. See here. It was a deep wound. I couldn't use the arm for three months. You know what I got as compensation? Five grand. 5,000. The state is a fucking pimp. Well isn't this nice. New friends? Are you learning robber language for babies? Morse code for "idiot". Go ahead and laugh. You have a lot to laugh about. You disarmed your partner so well,. Svensson is laughing himself to death. It's not a good idea to have Elomaa as an enemy. Wouldn't you say? - Do we have anything other than beer? - Take it easy. Maybe I'll buy a boat. I think it's affordable now. - You can buy the whole ?land Ferry. - Perfect. Lots of duty free. There's no longer any duty free. They tax us to death. Then I might buy one of these. Coast Guard Rescue, you are calling on channel 16. I'm going to get one of these boats! Why are you shouting? - Damn, what is it with you? - What are you doing? Are you spying on me? - You're always staring at me. - I'm keeping an eye on you. I don't trust you. What have you got there? Why don't you relax. We're in the same boat. - Show me what's in your hand. - I have nothing. If you don't trust me, we have a problem. Now stop playing clever with me. Okay? Now I'll release you. Stay still. - Are you drunk? - No. Where's Elomaa? We're playing poker. He was at the pier. He was going for a swim or something. I think I'll take a couple of million from my share. You can take care of the rest for me. Okay? - If you trust us. - It's not about trust. You wouldn't dare cheat me. - Do you have a smaller bag? - What happened? How small? Will this do? Yes, I'll take it. Aren't we playing poker? Listen. Cut it out, now. Forget about him cheating us. He's letting us look after his share. - What? - Are you with us? We're leaving tomorrow morning. Johan, wake up. St?hlgren says the Coast Guard received a signal... on the emergency frequency. It sounded like a brawl. From Nordlands?n, one hour by boat from Lundby tunnel. The others have gone home. Should we add more to the bow? Should we put some under the tarpaulin? - Elomaa? - I don't know. Good morning. Two million. How is Svensson? And warrior Elomaa? I'm not sure. Maybe his pride is wounded, but physically he's fine. - Are we ready? - I forgot a couple of keys. - Hello, my friend. - Hello. Wait. - Where are you letting me off? - We could sail around the island. But it's best to take a healthy walk through the woods. There's a fishing camp three miles that way. Roe and shrimp. Take a water taxi from there. Or join us in the sun on the beaches. - Helicopter. - Take cover! - Coast Guard or police? - Does it matter? They're circling overhead. Clearly, they're looking for something. I wondered when the first helicopter would show up. Do you know what gave you away? You know what I mean. The key chain. You returned with the keys in your hand to show that you had them. He's dead, right? I would have done the same thing, Seth. You can take it easy. I won't say anything. I sat with Svensson last night. He raved the whole time and said your name several times. Seth. Seth Rydell. Take it easy. I can be relied upon. A helicopter, there! They're coming straight towards us. Damn. Damn... Are you going to play Archipelago Rambo? I saved your life in Sheberghan. - Don't give me orders, you fucking cunt. - Shoot the helicopter! Then they'll back off. - Hell! - Down! Hell! What are we going to do? Tell us! Take it easy. Here we go. Hang with me! - Better if we split up. - Pity. We would be a good battle team. What the hell do we do? - Police! - Show your hands! - Mamma's going to be pissed off. - Do me a favor. - Close your eyes. - You know how it's going to be. She's... No! Seth! Over here! - 98 from 01. Understood. Thanks. - One dead upstairs. The helicopter saw someone with two bags and a rifle moving that way... about three kilometers. Off you go. Niklas! Take over there. Vidar, go get 'em. - Any regrets? - Yes. I have. - Do you have a weapon for me too? - AK or pistol? I'll take the pistol. Go! Clear! Hell... Clear! - No. - Patrick, there were five. Including the Riksbank driver. You can't tell who they are from the video. We don't know if we got them all. But we'll find out. Where the hell have you been? I met a girl in a bar. Did she drive a truck or a van? You should call Natascha. She did not sound happy that you just ran off. She talked about moving to her mother's in Sk?ne. And the phone's been ringing like crazy in your jacket. - See you. - Bye. "17 Missed Messages" - Did you think I had changed sides? - Not at all. I trusted you. But, hey... We found 240 million on the boat. Eight million with the dead, Elomaa. Do you know where the last two million went? No, sorry. No idea. I'm as sure of my innocence, as you were that I didn't change sides. - Where's the CPU? - 2.5 metres inside the door, Sophie said. The Riksbank driver said Elomaa shot his partner. Yes. What else has he told you? Take it easy. He hasn't mentioned you. Everyone else is dead. Svensson died of a gunshot wound in the stomach. Lundstr?m, suicide by cop. Elomaa... shot himself in the head in a boathouse. That's too bad. And Riksbank doesn't pay a reward... without the name and details of the recipient. It's necessary for tax purposes, they say. Even if the police were in favour of it, Riksbank won't do it. What can I say? "Hooray for Swedish bureaucracy!" Sorry. Great, Matte! Finally, you've learned how to disable an alarm effectively. - I thought you'd use some high-tech stuff. - I already did... a signal jammer aimed right through the wall. Didn't you see it? You wanted the burglary to look like the work of a junkie. Right. Take a few bottles when you go. He may have some raki. If we find what we're looking for, will we turn it in as lost property? Once again, traditional police work has paid off. Police aviation surveillance was responsible for the arrests Check this out. An old classic. Imagine that! He put it in the washing machine. Don't think we can relax now and rest on our laurels. The fight against serious, organized crime continues. Wait here. What are you doing? He has opened the gates of heaven... so that I may enter in. Through his blood he has saved me... and kept me as his own.
