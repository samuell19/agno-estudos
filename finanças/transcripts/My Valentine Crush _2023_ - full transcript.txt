Where you been? Tell me. We need to catch up. Nah, that ain't nobody. Oh, oh. Oh, okay. So, spill it. You still dating that cutie with the tattoos? 5-9, 195 pounds, white teeth. - Um, I'm not... - What's his name again? Hey look, Princess, I never mentioned his name. Oh. Well, you didn't have to, girl. I mean, the streets be talking. Okay. Why am I not surprised? So anyway, I mean, like, where is he? Another business meeting? I know you're not talking about... He's somewhere minding his business like you should be. - Here, take this. - Thank you. Hey, Jasmine. Great party. This is so good. Yes, isn't it? Made it just for my guests. Oh, what is that?

I'm gonna handle that tonight. There you go. Like, who actually invited her? There's no invite. It's invite only. Oh, okay. - Hey. - Hey. Hey. You two know each other? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He uh, actually helped me earlier today. Interesting. Guys, this is Darryl. Darryl, these are my friends. Hey. Yo, what up, D? What up, bro? Hello, D. Yeah, I use that term loosely. Well um, it was nice meeting you. Good seeing you again, Krystal. You too. Yeah um, you look good, Krystal. Still out here getting your heart broken? Wow. Well, my heart is actually intact. Thank you, Summer. I mean, what about you? Are you still spreading your legs thin across the city, or is Darryl the lucky winner, huh? The only thing I spread is butter. You know what? Um, I'm about to go get another drink uh, and I'll see you later. Yeah, you do that. Bitch. Whore. Thank you for coming. Yeah, girl, I like your friends. - Uh-huh. - Not. Thank you for having me. Yeah. She's so aggressive. So, the last thing we need is another podcast from a man with mommy issues. Mm. Like, if you dislike women, just say that. Ma'am, that's all I'm saying. Oh, okay, hold up. Some of those podcasts are for shock value, but most of 'em be speaking facts. In what world? Right. Like, name one thing that they say that's true. I'll wait. Oh, okay. Oh, I can name many. Um, first off, women no longer subscribe to the idea of submission, which is hurting relationships. I mean, not our relationship. My lady ain't got no problem with submission. But, we're not even gonna get into all of that. Secondly, women have more masculine energy and it's stopping men from leading. You know, our natural position. Okay, now, to be fair, women have had no choice but to step up because many were left holding the bag. Uh, how so? Come on. What do you mean? There are so many women who are left alone with children to feed and protect because men are scared to embrace commitment. - Exactly. - And that right there can harden the softest woman, because in her mind, she can't be vulnerable, she has to be strong. Yeah, well, all of that is gonna be thrown out the window soon, because some states are entertaining the idea of allowing child support during the fetal stage. - Ah, what? - See, and that's exactly what I'm talking about. That's, that's taking it way too far. That's just another tactic to keep men down. Now, now, I don't, I don't agree with that, fellas. - What? - This. Oh, Jesus. I'm just saying there has to be some merit to it. Bro, listen, I know we got some fine women in here, bro. - That part... - Bro. But you gotta stop all that capping. - Oh, leave him alone. - Just be yourself. Leave him alone. I'm, I'm being serious when I say that. Man, my mother almost died when she gave birth to me. Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. Nah, it's cool. I just think a lot of men don't factor in the cost of bringing a baby into this world. I mean, a lot of women have issues, you know, doctor visits, you know, the cost in itself. So why would they have to take care of that alone? I mean, they didn't make 'em alone. Fantastic, Darryl. Now, you see, I knew I liked you for reason. Let me get that back. No, no, no, I need that G card back. You just let every man in America down. - Seriously? Come on, G. - Every man in America, bro. What is wrong with you? Wait a minute. Aren't you being ridiculous, bro. All right, all right. On, on that note, I am going to go get some fresh air, so. - Some fresh air. - All right, see you guys in a minute. I, I second that. - What? - Is that right? What? No. All good. Cheers to you. Okay, see, that's... What um, , so maybe um, you run that back exactly what you meant. I wanna, clear that up for me. - Go on. - Submission, like, like, you know us, man you know us. We got the, we got a thing. Here you go. You um, you enjoying yourself? I am now. Look, my friends can be a little crazy, so I apologize about that. Nah, it's, it's no biggie. You look nice. Thank you. You're welcome. So uh, you and Summer dating. I see that. No, Summer and I are just friends. I think you need to define what friends mean. No, I'm, I'm pretty clear about it. Well, I think you need to enlighten me. Summer and I, we see each other from time to time. I don't see it really going anywhere past friendship, so. I mean, but I make a great wing man. - Oh, you do, huh? - Yeah. I mean, does she kinda know that? 'Cause I don't think that she knows that at all, like. Why do you ask? I don't know. I'm just being curious, I guess. You know, nosy. Super nosy. I, it's none of my business. Okay. So, are you being nosy? Or are you curious about me as much as I'm curious about you? I mean, what are the odds? Two times in one day. If I didn't know any better, I'd say it was a sign. - A sign? - A sign. What kinda sign? Like a sign sign. A sign sign. Look, you know what, I, I, I gotta get back. Or, or we could just, you know, dish the debate club, enjoy the rest of the night our way. Our way? Yeah. Just you and me. I, I, I can't, I can't do that. My girlfriends, the debate team. Okay, look, just all right. Just, just give a second. All right. The night's still young. You wanna hang out with me? Yeah. And dish the debate club? I, I'm not trying to go back in there. Me either. So I think we probably just need to go. Well come on, Krystal, come on. So, tell me like, what have you been up to all of these years? Like, you never wanted to leave, like the city? Actually, I have. I wanted to go to college to play football, but I didn't have the money or a scholarship, so I went to the Marine Corps instead. Mm. Did a few years and then I got outta there. So, it wasn't for you? I mean, I was good at it. Just missed my friends and my family, so I came back. So how did you even end up at a cable company? I was always fascinated with electronics. Saw an ad, I applied. Been there ever since. So, you never wanted more? What do you mean, more? Like, more like, wife, kids, family. I was married once, but we were young. She was in love with someone else, so I let her go. Just like that? Just like that. Can't make no one love you if they don't. Yeah. Come on. What about you? Me? I graduated high school at the top of my class, and I continued with an MBA. That's impressive. Mm-hmm. But you're not married? No kids? Oh no, like, I just, I don't think it was like part of my cards, you know? And honestly, I'm not giving up on love, no way. Even though I need to find the right one. So what do you do for fun? Define fun. Oh no, no. Please don't tell me you're one of those slaves to your job. Ah. You gotta get out and live your life, Krystal. There's a whole lotta life to live. Yeah, I know, I know. It's just, look, I've worked so hard, like trying to rank up the ladder, and fun hasn't just been on the cards, you know? Yeah. Hm. Well, if there's anything you can do, I mean, anything in this world that you can do right now, what would it be? Anything. - Anything? - Anything. Mm. It take that long to answer? Uh, I'll perform. So you sing? I had no idea you was an artist. You can, sing me something? No, no, no, no, no, no. I don't do that. I, I do poetry. Oh, cool. You, so you, have you ever done a, an open mic night? I mean, a couple of years ago, so, you know. What's today? It's Thursday. You okay? Yeah. Just fun, okay? You got this. Okay uh, I need two shots. Double. Okay. Oh my god. I cannot believe it. He's making me do this. It's ridiculous. Man, I'm so glad to be here with y'all tonight, man. Y'all don't even understand how, how hard it was to get away from my wife to get to my side chick tonight. I know some of y'all not laughing at that, but it's okay. If you're not laughing, you're probably the side chick. Uh-huh. You a cheater. Like, you're the best cheater I've ever met in my life. Like, I'll lose my, my freedom over you. All your cheating, man, I can't do it. I'm not gonna do that. You know, love is a good thing. And I feel like, if you find somebody to love, right? Somebody that loves you, like with all your flaws and everything. Somebody that loves your dirty drawers, you should love theirs back. Oh, okay. Thank you. You nervous? Yeah. Ah, ladies and gentlemen, listen. I got a good friend of mine in the building tonight, man. One of the dopest promoters in the city. Y'all clap it up for my man, Darryl Jackson. Man, make some noise. Now, he's one of the dopest promoters next to me, 'cause you know, I gets down. I, I could pack a house. You dig. So that's my man, he's a hundred grand. And, he didn't just bring his, his littlest suit tonight. He brought um... He brought a special somebody with him, who's gonna perform for us tonight. Her name is Krystal Dawson. Y'all clap it up for Krystal Dawson. - That's you. - No, no, no, no, no. I, I, I can't do this. What? What do you mean, - you can't? - No, no, no, no, no, I haven't performed in a long time... Krystal, you are head woman in a pharmaceutical company. - Okay. - Okay? Okay. You can do this. I can do this. You're that woman. I am that woman. - You're that woman. - I am that woman. Darryl, just tap her ass. Now go be that woman. Okay. Uh-huh, okay, and shot number one, and shot number two. Y'all clap it up. Give her a little courage, give her some encouragement. Come on up here. Just be yourself. Yeah. Come on up here, Krystal. Praise the Lord. We're just gonna wait on ya. Let the spirit move you. Any slower, we'll all be 50. I'll be right down. Please. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. All right, come on. Ladies and gentlemen, one more time. Clap it up for Krystal Dawson. Whoo! Um. Hi, uh. This poem is called uh, "On the Stand." On the stand, running tears coming down my face like running water coming down from a faucet. I think I just lost it. I can't take no more being a hostage of things you did to hurt me, damage me, stab me, kill me. Damn, you wanted to bury me. And when I mean me, I mean my heart. We was torn apart from the start, torn from my head to my heart. But that's another version of what I'm not talking about. Zoning me out. You're not even trying to hear me out, thinking in your head like, what is this chick talking about? Killing me softly and not quickly because you wanted to see me hurt every single minute. Stabbing me in the eyes so you wouldn't see how much pain you put me through. Get out of my presence. Get out this courtroom, lying and caging yourself. You killed my heart. So what do I got left? You was guilty. The judge speaks, "Order the courtroom." I stand, saying you was guilty of breaking an innocent heart. Guilty of betrayal. Guilty of a relationship failed. Guilty of honesty. Guilty of everything you ever told me. You was guilty. And that's why you have to pay the price. I sentence you to life. And if there is nothing further, your honor, the case is closed. Now snap it up, one more time for Miss Krystal Dawson. That was good, good. That's good. Yeah, y'all give it up, man. You can't, you can't even make that up. That's, that's passion right there. God. I cannot believe I just did that. That was amazing. That was like amazing, right? And like, everybody was like staring at me, and they thought like, I was great. And I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh my god, thank you so much, like... You're welcome. For like, even me speaking my truth. Like, that is just so amazing. Oh my god, thank you. Look, the night's still young. Yes. Let's celebrate.

Good morning to you. So I tried calling to make sure you made it home safely last night, but I heard you were hanging out with Darryl. Who told you that? A little birdie told me. Who, Summer? Nope. Eddie. Didn't I tell you they go way back? You failed to mention that to me. Well, yes they do. Okay, so anyway, tell me, how did it go? Oh my god, girl, he is such a gentleman. He's amazing. He's thoughtful. He's like, girl, everything. Oh, really? And you know what? He just left. Wait a minute. Please tell me you did not sleep with him. No, I did not. I really don't want you to hurt him if you're still into Xavier. No, I did not. And actually, I told him that I was actually seeing somebody. Really? How did he respond? He told me that I needed someone to cherish me. Well, he's absolutely right about that. But in the meantime, you need to let go of that lame and focus on the nice... Okay, look, I gotta go because I have a date - this morning. - What? Wait a minute. Krystal, we're not done talking. Oh, I think the phone is going out. Oh, oh, ah, oh, ah. I got a date.

Mm, 'cause it seemed like she still has a thing for you. Monica and I are divorced for a reason, and I don't wanna talk about it right now. So, if you don't mind. Carrie, my ass. Okay, who does she think that she talking to, huh? My name is Krystal La'naye Dawson. Okay? I'm a professional dog walker. I will dog walk her ass all through this breakfast table. She don't know me.

Hey, you're uh, back in town. That I am. Damn, I missed you, girl. Well, it's only been a couple of days. What's there to miss? Remember that trip I told you with the sales division I couldn't miss? Yeah, you made it perfectly clear that you couldn't spend Valentine's Day with me. Well, I closed a huge deal. I mean a huge deal. And guess what? What? We're going on a weekend getaway. What? Pack your bags, we going to Bahamas. Are you serious? Yeah. No, no, no, no. We're not, we're not... Right now, right now. I don't, I don't have things to wear. I don't, I don't know... Girl, go.

Yo, chill. Slow down. You and Jazz didn't slow down and y'all fine. Y'all happy. Look, when you know, you know, and I know. And you don't know anything yet. All right. What about the dude she's seeing? Does he know that you know? She told me I didn't have to worry about that. Listen, okay. Look, when a woman has her eyes set on somebody, and has spent a lot of time cultivating that relationship, it's not that easy for her to just break free. I hear you. I, I promise you, I ain't throwing no shade. But you just met the lady. Now Jazz told me Krystal's good people. But, you need to take your time, all right? Let's go ahead and see how this plays out. Ain't no need to rush things. All right. See now, this is when it gets real. So let's toast. To new beginnings, on an amazing road to a potentially great relationship. - Salud. - Salud. Toast. What are you guys in here talking about? Nothing, sis. - Nothing? - Nope. Yeah, I heard my name and something about relationships. Yeah, only relationship you gotta worry about is yours. - Right. - And it's good. You got you a fine black man who know how to put in work, and we good. Which is in good standings, by the way. We are good. So let's, let's not be all up in this man's business. Oh, no, this is guy talk. - Oh, guy talk. - Guy talk. - Yeah, man. - Tell me later. Man talk. I ain't tell you later. I ain't gonna tell you later. So you really not gonna talk to me? There is nothing to talk about, Xavier. Look, it's not my fault that I got sick. We're at a beautiful resort and I enjoyed it by myself. Look, I didn't intend for none of that to happen, all right? Really? Yeah. Okay look, I know, you couldn't help getting sick, even though I told you that that sandwich was half cooked. Yeah, you did. Okay? And I should've listened. I'm sorry. Come here. No. Come here.

No, not this morning. Wow. That's a first. Guess I'll just grab an apple. Whatever. Just eat the apple. Hey, hey, hey. What's going on with you? You used to love cooking for me. Okay. The world doesn't center around you, Xavier. Remember, I have a job? Okay, wait a minute. Why are you even still here? Look, I got a meeting later today. I thought maybe we could spend some time together. Spend some time together? Yeah. What's going on? What are you talking about? Xavier, you never spend any time with me. Now all of a sudden you wanna spend some time with me? - Listen. - What's going on? Come here, come here. Listen. Look, I know we ain't been on the same page lately, but... You expecting somebody, Kris? No, it's probably Jasmine. Give me a second. Jasmine. - Hey. Hey, I was, I was... - Darryl. What are you doing here? Yeah, Darryl, what are you doing here? Xavier. I was in the neighborhood, so I figured I'd bring you some soup. You know, since you were under the weather. Oh, ain't that sweet. Listen, my man, only thing she's under is your boy. Xavier. Bro. Um, um, Xavier, this is uh, uh, Darryl. Darryl is um, the, the cable, the cable guy. Thank you. Thank you for the soup. You're welcome. Listen, cable guy, we got your soup, so uh, I think you better get going. We're in the middle of something. Ain't that right, babe? Xavier. I see. Well, I leave y'all to it. Oh, god. You wanna explain yourself? Who the hell is Darryl? Nobody, just nobody. Looked a whole hell of a lot more than a nobody to me. I said, nobody. Okay? You know what's funny, Krystal? You spend all that time talking about making it official, and titles. I knew you was creeping when I saw two coffee mugs in your sink. Who the hell do you think you're talking to, huh? Don't you flip this around on me. Ignore my calls, the hoes in your phone. You have no room to talk about anyone, Xavier. You're incredible, you know that? Yes, I know that. And the problem is, you don't. So you know what, Xavier. What? I'm done. You better think long and hard about that 'cause if I leave this house, I'm not coming back. And you know what, Xavier? That's the plan. Okay. So you're really willing to lose me? This. Trust me, Xavier, it's no loss. Goodbye. And don't you ever come back. You know what, Krystal? Maybe you are better off with that cable guy, huh? You might even get a discount. You'll get all the channels. You know what?

If you could just, if you could just call me back, please. There you go. I figured you could use some ice cream. I sure do. It's melting all over the place. And I should. What's going on, Kris? Talk to me. Look, I just let Xavier talk to Darryl like he was nothing. Like, let him do it. He'll be all right. I don't think so. I have tried to call him, text, nothing. Then just give him some space. I mean, he doesn't seem like the type of guy to hold grudges. No. And then Xavier, calling me with another woman on the phone? Whoo. I'm so glad you are over that lame. Crazy. Don't be so hard on yourself. It'll be okay. Let me get my spoon, because you ain't eating this ice cream like it's the best thing that you ever had. Mm, this is. Mm. - Mm, mm-hmm. - That was good. Mm-hmm, it is. I figured you'd be out here. Oh yeah? Yeah. This is where you always be when you have something on your mind. Wanna talk about it? Nope. That text message said everything you needed to know. All right. Say let's, let's check up. Ooh. Oh, we in our feelings, huh? You in your feelings. You in your feelings. Ah! Whoo-hoo, that was pretty. Whoo! You know they call me Pretty Eddie for a reason, right? I gave you that name, E. Oh, that's true. Okay. Here we go. Oh, oh-oh, we serious now, huh? Huh? Got ya. We not young no more, E. That one ain't gonna work on me, baby. Okay. All right. - Show you how it's done, E. - Okay. Okay. Show you how it's done. Get off me, E. Okay. Ah! Right? Right? - My god. - No. Remember that time we were at the water park and you thought you were drowning? Oh my god, that was so embarrassing. It was so funny though. No. Everyone around us just kept yelling, "Just stand up." You were flapping your hands, and your ponytail was floating in the water behind you. Oh, that, that was like so embarrassing. I didn't like that at all. And it was hanging around my favorite crush. Wait, what was his name? Um, uh... - Dexter McGrady. - Dexter freakin' McGrady. Oh my gosh. Wow. Gosh, why does love have to be so hard, Jazz? Mm. Like, for real. Love isn't hard. We humans just complicate things. So, it was my fault? I mean, since we're handing out the blame card. Okay, you're supposed to be my friend right now, right? Well you know I wouldn't love you if I didn't tell you the truth. And of course you know I love you, girl. Xavier wasn't worth your time though. I mean, don't get me wrong. He was perfect on paper. He had multiple degrees. He was attractive. He had money. He checked everything off your list that you wanted in a man. But, what about his values? His integrity? He never treated you like you were the only one. And he always made plans before you. I tried to convince myself that Xavier was the perfect man for me. Hm. And then I met Darryl. He made me feel like everything was amazing. He made me feel alive and everything. And, he made me laugh. And I just ruined it. Well, all of the chips have fallen. All you can do is just gracefully pick them back up. Look, let me have a heart to heart with Eddie. Maybe he can convince Darryl to giving you a call. Look, I'm not making any promises... - Yeah. - And I don't know what's gonna happen. But, you never know. I appreciate that. That's the least I can do, friend. Ooh, oh. Mm, ooh. Where are you going? Girl, we have been eating ice cream and drinking wine, and you know dairy does not agree with my stomach. I forgot about that. Uh-huh, yeah. So, I'll see you in the morning. Have a good night. Love you, girl. I love you too. You ordered this for me. I was cool with a smoothie. Incoming. Okay. - You gonna do what I say. - All right. Krystal. Haven't seen you since Valentine's Day. And now you're here, disturbing our brunch. Hey, Summer, how are you? Darryl? Hey. What's up? Where's your boyfriend? Um, he's no longer around. I see. Uh, Krystal, you need something? 'Cause obviously we're busy. Yeah, Summer, can, can I talk to him for a second, please? I don't know. You wanna talk to your little friend, Darryl? Okay. We can talk outside. Uh, Darryl, you know you don't, you don't have to go outside. It'll only take a minute. What is it? Look, I messed up royally. Apology accepted. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Please just, can you just please hear me out, please? What is it that you wanna say to me, Krystal? Because you didn't have anything to say the other day. I thought we had a connection. We did. Look, we still do. No, I made a mistake opening up to a woman that wanted to play games. I stood on my truth and you shot me down. Look, I was confused. Look, I know now what I want, and I know that it's you. Look, I'm glad you had a lot of time to think about that. I really am. But I don't come second to no man. Even if I am a cable guy. ♪ I'm going off ♪ They going off the mat ♪ All the mistakes they making, I made ♪ ♪ I could've taught you that ♪ I gotta watch Yeah, boy. Honestly, now look. What you got right here is prime Angus beef, seasoned to perfection, my brother. Now, the secret is to put some that washer-whooser sauce, - Worcester... - Worcestershire sauce. Yeah, the W sauce. You gotta put that in there. It holds in the juices. Keeps it fresh. Yeah, just wanna get warmed up real quick. - Okay. - All right. Yo, yo. Um, how you feeling, man? What's been good with you, man? Really? I been good. Nah, for real. How you been? E, if there's something you wanna ask me, why don't you just ask me? Thought that's what I was doing. I just asked you twice. Seriously though. How you doing, man? I saw Krystal the other day. Really? How'd that go? Not good. Yeah, sorry to hear that. I know you fell pretty hard, pretty fast, man. Yeah, well, I learned my lesson, and it'll never happen again, I'll tell you that. And uh, what lesson you learn? Never fall for the same woman twice. Twice? You just met her. The first time I met Krystal was in high school. What? Yeah, and when I saw her the other day, I acted as if I had never seen her a day in my life. But, I remember her. She would be sitting in that library, doing math. I mean always math. I never really seen anything else, just math. Like she was trying to accomplish something, you know? I mean, she was the most beautiful, smart girl I've ever seen in my life. Seriously. Hey. I mean, I was a ball player so I had girls coming at me left and right, left and right, and, just wasn't able to make my move. So I never did anything about my crush. Hm. Wow. That was deep, huh? Huh, deeper than the Atlantic Ocean, my brother. - I wasn't expecting that. - Well, you asked for it. You asked for it. Man. But, that's the past. I'm good. It's all good. Food looks good. Oh, you all ready know that. There's no love lost. My man. All right. So, who you got for the finals? Finals? You mean who I got forever? Who? - Chicago. - Chicago. You already know that. You gonna die, they gonna bury you in red, watch. Hey, hey, long as you know. I know. I know the world don't know, but I know. Y'all better not be in here burning up my food. Look what the cat drug in. What? Um, babe, I gotta show you something in the bedroom. The bedroom? Yeah. Man, you good? In the bedroom? Good to see you, Krystal. You too. Mm, smells good in here. Mm-hmm. You look good too. Thank you. Is that how it is? You're just not gonna talk to me, Darryl. - Darryl? - You know, I can't believe you let old boy talk to me like that. And you didn't say anything. I am sorry. Okay? Sorry? - Yes, I'm sorry. - Sorry? Well sorry just don't quite make it right now, does it? Damn. Darryl. - Darryl. - That's crazy. Can you just at least - talk to me. - That's what you got to say... Darryl, just, can you please just talk to me? What is it that you want me to say, Krystal? You say you want love, but you entertain a clown. Darryl. I thought you wanted peace, but you choose the very thing that moves you further away from it. But you say you want me, right? But we both know how that went down. So maybe I just need to accept the fact that you ain't the woman that you say you are. Look, I'm sorry. Look, I am that woman, that never changed. It's just, look, it's complicated. - Complicated? - It's complicated. Krystal, complicated? Solving world hunger is complicated. Finding the cure for cancer is complicated. But leaving somebody that does not love you, that does not care about you or honor you, - it's not complicated, Krystal. - Listen, I'm sorry. Okay? Sorry, sorry. - That's all I can hear, sorry. - I'm sorry. Okay, I don't know what to say. I don't even know what to do. - But honestly... - Okay. Me being honest with you, is not me being honest with myself. I met Xavier when I was at a business retreat and I thought that he was everything that I ever wanted. And then I met you. So I was a rebound? - No you wasn't a rebound. - I was just a rebound. No, you wasn't a rebound. - That's how I felt, Krystal! - Darryl, Darryl, please just stop. Just listen to me. When I met you, I felt alive, I felt seen, I felt heard. And I just want you to know that. So then tell me, what did you expect to accomplish by coming down here to tell me that? Because I don't give a damn. Get on. Darryl, just. Look, I didn't respect this, that's for sure. But what I do know is that, what I felt, and actually what I felt for you is real. I actually fell in love with you. Krystal. Wait. I tried. Give me a hug. Look, I gotta, I just gotta get outta here. On the stand, running tears coming down my face like running water - coming down from the faucet. - I know you seen me call you. I called you like five times. That's not, that's crazy. I think I'm exhausted. I can't take no more being a hostage, of things you did to hurt me. Damaged me, stab me, kill me. Damn, you wanted to bury me. And when I mean me, I mean my heart. Now we was torn apart from the start, torn from my head to my heart. But that's another version of what I'm not talking about. Zoning me out, not trying to hear me out. Thinking in your head like what is this chick talking about? Hey, sweetie. Hey. I swear, you love this place, don't you? Just as much as you do. Can I join you? What? Where's Carrie? Her name's Krystal. Sorry, Krystal. I thought she might be here. Where is she? What do you want, Monica? Um. What do I want? I was just uh... Darryl, I was hoping that um, maybe we could try again. Monica, you know there was a time when I would've cut off my left arm to be with you, but you made it very clear that's not what you were looking for. Look, sweetie, we were young then. And um, I just wasn't ready for what you had to offer. There's that. Darryl, you have, you've always been a very good man, honest, and a man of integrity. You know, you were very clear about the life you wanted to live and, baby, sometimes that can just be a bit much. So, was that before or after you stepped out? 'Cause I'm confused. Darryl, seeing you with uh, Carrie the other day, it just, ooh, it just made me think about what we could be now. Baby, I love you. Her name's Krystal, and I appreciate your sentiment, but I lost my appetite. I'm gonna go. I guess that's a no, huh? That's a hell no. Carrie, my ass.
