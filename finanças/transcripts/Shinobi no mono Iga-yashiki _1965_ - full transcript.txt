A DAIEI COMPANY, LTD. PRODUCTION In the year 1637, Toyotomi's men who had survived the Battle of Sekigahara went to fight in the Battle of Shimabara. But badly outnumbered, they were soundly defeated. Lord Matsudaira Izu, top general of Tokugawa's side led his men up the road to Edo. But there is a man thinking of the Tokugawa as his mortal enemy. 1 will fight the Tokugawa clan and Lord Matsudaira Izu's flag. I will avenge myself on them! Father, please take me with you! No! Saisuke, listen to me! Yes! I was raising this girl as your sister until now. But she is not your real sister. What? She is Princess Yuri, the daughter of Sanada Yukimura. He left her with me when he went to Osaka for the battle. Saisuke... You must take care of the princess from now on. Yes! Father! Yes. This is a double-edged sword inherited from our ancestor. Listen, Saisuke. A ninja's heart must be double-edged, like this blade. You must rest the eyes within your heart, and feel and search with your body. You must think that this is your father and use it to take care of them! Can you do that? Yes! Good bye, Saisuke! I am a vassal of the Toyotomi, Kirigakure Saizo is my name. I will kill Lord Matsudaira Izu! Father!

But even after three generations of peace, the shogunate which was built on the cold hearted policy of taking land away from the people, had caused many to commit seppuku, by ignoring their rivalries and thus severing all ties. Including Okazaki Saburo Nobuyasu, the daimyo who perished under Tokugawa rule came to about 7,228,530. Then about 200,000 ronin became jobless and hopeless. Hard feelings grew inside the Tokugawa shogunate, and men carried their rusted spears day and night, and they became an ominous dark cloud in the world. The depth of the pond is about 12 feet and the stone block's height is about 36 feet. I think the best way to the main building's right wing entrance is to break through the main gate. How is their security? At the main gate, there are about 30 gunners, 10 archers, 10 lancers and 2 cannons. This is just my guess. Is this the Masugata Gate? That's right! The gate facing out is wide and the inside courtyard has a succession of high stone walls. There is also a watchtower with wooden poles on three sides, so we have no way to get out. In order to crush their enemies, there is a log barricade which they roll down on attackers. But there is a way we can do it. Kanae, go after them! Thank you! What is your name? 1am just a lone wolf who takes the side of all ronin. Please be careful with Izunokami's Koga ninja! A few days ago, an unknown ninja killed some of our men, slaughtering one after another. I think these incidents were done by the same person. We're trying to find out who committed these crimes, but we haven't learned anything as yet. Could it be an Iga ninja? 1 don't think there is an Iga ninja who would be so foolish. If it is an Iga ninja, the only one I can think of was ten years ago at Shimabara and that was Kirigakure Saizo. What? Kirigakure Saizo? Kirigakure Saizo can't still be alive! If he were alive, Genshinsai, instead of you Lord Izu would have Kirigakure as his right hand man. How can you say that? Anyway, if they look for Marubashi, I think their purpose is Yui Shosetsu. Genshinsai, keep an eye on Yui's dojo! KUSANOKU-STYLE SCHOOL OF MILITARY STRATEGY CHOUKOU-DO YUI KAKIBENOSUKE SHOSETSU Even though the enemy is holding their spears downward, or their eyes are cast down and their voices are calm, you must not rush. You must trust your leader and wait for his decision. You must also stay calm and keep your face up when they attack suddenly. You must not shout and wave your spears at them. If you do, this means weak leadership, and without discipline, everyone will be killed. 1 yield! Next! - 1 yield! - Get up! Wait, I lost...! Next! Anybody, come and challenge me! Won't anybody challenge me? Why are you so timid? I think you'd better take a break. What did you say? 1 am the 15th man you will face. Even you, the famous Marubashi, must be tired. This is nothing to me! Come on! Challenge me! You are great! I took a good look at your Hozoin technique last night. Oh, excuse me! You are bad! I almost made a fool of myself! I've heard that a ninja's heart must be like a double-edged sword. I always like a person who takes matters seriously. When mental power and physical power come together, an ordinary person becomes an exceptional one, and it's possible he can do anything with human power. My father's dying words were that he would be reborn often, and destroy the Tokugawa shogunate. But they're so powerful now that it will be a long time before they disappear. Those who think in this way must band together and fight. 1 am just one of the professors, so I just want to live peacefully without taking anyone's side. I know what you're saying, but can you ignore everything and live peacefully? It doesn't matter who or what you are. If we don't fight the Tokugawa, we can't survive. Don't you agree? The vision of our freedom is taken away. This is proof of the Tokugawa's power. The man trying to make his dream come true is... your sworh enemy, Lord Matsudaira Izu. Even if I kill Lord Izu, my father's grudge won't disappear. And if I just take revenge for my father, I will not be satisfied. Going after the powerful Tokugawa and fighting them. I find this to be the only reason for living. It's beautiful to see a young man living for this purpose. Yui-dono. If we want to succeed at this, we must calculate right, and do whatever is necessary. Marubashi Chuya-dono, Kanei Hanbei-dono, Kato Rokuroemon-dono, and all the graduate students. If they go to every corner in Osaka, and the ronin rise in rebellion, the government will be shaken. Yui-dono, how long can they last? Ninja are fearsome. You can read my heart and mind. But we only have the power to fight in the darkness. The men who can move the world are men like you and Marubashi. You stay at the edges of difficulty casting a baleful eye without gaining higher posts while following your dreams. You are noble... - Enough! A spy for Matsudaira! Who's there? I am from Niiyama. I got lost and... ended up here. I am very sorry. Princess! Aren't you Princess Yuri? Saisuke...? Aren't you Saisuke from Iga? Yes, I am. Princess, you're all right! I was looking for you all this time. But, Princess, why are you here at the house of Lord Matsudaira? It's a long story. I'm sorry. Princess, I'll return tonight. Then you can tell me. Hey you, wait! Can you give a good massage? If you need a good massage, please ask somebody else. No, it isn't necessary! I'm very tired because this was my first sword practice. So, can you massage my shoulders? But I'm not a suitable man. Don't worry. Come this way, please. Come this way, and massage my shoulders. Excuse me. You're from Niiyama, aren't you? Yes, sir. What is your name? It's Saisuke. Is this your first time in Koga? No, I was working at the home of Mito-sama. Is that right? There is a man there who was working for the Iga. What was his name? Is it Sakaguchi Genbu-sama? That's it. Do you have martial arts skills? Yes, just a little. I thought so. Because you know a vital point. My left shoulder is scarred. I was wounded 14 years ago, and it's starting to bother me. It is difficult to get rid of old scars, no matter what kind. The music was a little different before. It's so hard to understand the hearts of young people. It seems to me, the purer people are, the more mysterious they become. Princess! Princess! I'm here! It's Saisuke! Just keep looking down, please. Just stay like that and talk. It doesn't matter how softly. I can hear you no matter what. Saisuke. Just like your father, you became a ninja, didn't you? While I was out hunting, your family and you were taken away. That was Lord Matsudaira's order. The deputy, the guards, you and your parents were gone. And I realized that if I were to find you, Princess, I would have to become a ninja. So I went to the mountains and trained hard. After being captured I was sent to Edo. Izunokami-sama kindly took me in and raised me. What's he going to do with you? 1 don't know. While he sometimes acts like a loving father, he keeps his true self hidden, and he sometimes acts like a coldhearted person. I can't help thinking that he has a secret plan. Princess, somebody is coming! Yuri, it's me! The moon is full, let's go out and look at it. Your duty will be over soon. Yuri... As I expected, you worked very well. How about marrying into the Tokugawa family? I doubt that anyone knows you as Sanada Yukimura's daughter. You are a masterpiece that I have created with great care. Of all my creations, only you have a heart and soul. But no matter how beautiful, you are just my creation, so if a creator wants to destroy his work, it's easy. Yuri, do you understand? Kanae, this route is much too dangerous, you'd better go another way! I'll keep an eye out over here. Thank you! Hey! Let me have that book! Are you going to sell it to Yui or Kishu? 1 can't answer you. Just give it to me anyway! Wait, Saisuke! If you want a massage, I'm sorry, but no! Don't you want to clear up your father's regret? I have more important things to do. Are you trying to topple the Tokugawa shogunate? Under whose orders?! Nobody tells me what to do! Izunokami-dono, I'm not going to kill you, yet! Oran, are you there? Yes, sir, I'm here! Why did you let him have such an important book? I'll catch him if you want me to. No, it's not necessary. Oran, send someone to Kishu right away! The next time it will be money... 650,000 koku. KISHU Because of my concern for people, I made an emergency decision. Please forgive my rude action. Who is there? 1am an Iga ninja, Kirigakure Saizo. What? Are you Sanada Yukimura's man, and from Kirigakure's group? Yes, sir. Kirigakure Saizo, who died at Shimabara, was my father. Oh, so you're Saizo's son? Yes, sir. Why did you want me to meet you in a place like this? Because, I distrust how the Tokugawa run the government, and am opposed to their being in power. So, please allow me to say a few words on behalf of those people who feel the same way. What is it? I'm certain you've heard of the scholar, Yui Shosetsu of Edo. We think of him as the man best suited to fulfill our dream. He has the greatest mind and ability. He believes, Grand Councilor, that you should take our side, and he's here in this town waiting to meet you. Grand Councilor. I beseech you, please go and see Yui Shosetsu! You are rude! You're wearing ninja garb, even though you're an ordinary man, and you try to get close and talk about politics! Don't talk nonsense! Go, get lost! If you think I'm just a nobody talking nonsense, take a look at this book, please! He hired ronin from Shikoku, Chugoku, and Satsuma, and paid them twice the going rate. Especially a ronin from Fukushima, Murakami Hikoemon. He took most of the money before the other ronin got paid. What? Even people who were not hired by him. So many people have been mistreated in Kinki and Kanto. It's impossible. It's not only that. He hunts deer inside the castle, and sent a monetary "gift" to Matsuzaka Castle, and took control of Okayama Castle's moat, and is building a whaling ship in Kumanoura. There are 37 demands on that list. Where did you get this book from? I took it from Roju Minister Matsudaira Izu. What? Is that true? He not only wrote down how to control guns, but how many there are, too. And was accurate. Lord Izu, you're going to try and destroy Kishu...! My lord! Kirigakure, you've brought me valuable information. I will see Yui Shosetsu! But, lord... l don't care! This is a gamble that I can take over the nation or be destroyed! Either way, there's nothing to lose! Somebody with intelligence is more likely to be a coward. So you don't have to think too much. To be victorious, you have a better chance by not thinking! Fighting spirit does not come from studies. You're right, but there are enemies and allies when you go to war. Winning a war depends on having a good strategy planned out well before the actual fighting begins. You are so single minded. All right! Tell me your strategy, if you had to fight now. You mean attacking the castle? Yes, if you plan on attacking Edo Castle. You mean the Tokugawa? Is there anybody besides them? Who will back me up? Well... If I let you have the forces of Kii's 60,000 koku clan. Yes, sir. Isn't that enough for you? I'm afraid we can't topple the shogunate that easily now. Well, what then...? I'll send the ronin all over the country and gather forces until something happens. I'm sure that you can gather many ronin immediately. And if the people stand up for themselves, the laws of the land will become less strict. When you do that, you must send forces to Kyoto, Osaka, and Sunpu. Prepare to march on Edo! If you do that, there are some daimyo who will join. With their help, you can succeed. How many troops will be taking action? We have about 3,000 men. What do you want from me? I want your official sanction, and 10,000 ryo in war funds. Is my official sanction necessary? I must gather all the ronin, otherwise, it can't be done. I am exhausted. I listened to you too hard. Sensei, how did it go? KEIAN 4, SHOGUN IEMITSU HAS FALLEN ILL News of the shogun's illness has shaken up the entire nation and some clans are getting nervous. The next in line, Takechiyo-sama, is only 11. We must think seriously about how to deal with this situation. I've heard that someone in the house has Toyotomi's ronin, is secretly keeping weapons, and acts in a suspicious way. Lzunokami-dono. What are you going to do about the ronin? I'll let them blow up like a bubble, and then they can burst. That's the best way. If we take action too soon, people will get the wrong idea. But what will you do about the Kishu clan? 1 don't think the grand councilor will be fooled by the ronin plot. By going against the shogun his 650,000 koku would be in jeopardy. If we were to lose. Excuse me! Sakakibara Koan just reported that the shogun has died! What? Get over there! Hold on! You, leave! I think we should keep the shogun's death secret for now. I know. Some daimyo asked to leave after the shogun fell ill. Until the daimyo arrive in Edo, we have to think about what we're going to do. So, we must wait before making an announcement. The shogun is dead? The Kishu clan is having the funeral. The war will begin again. What's going to happen to Edo? 1 think the time of change is coming. Now is the chance to make things happen! Sensei, decide! I believe that Kanae will bring good news from Kishu. When we receive official sanction and 10,000 ryo war funds, then we'll decide when to take action. 1 understand what you're saying, but we must take action regardless of the Kishu clan's help. Kumagai, getting the ronin together is the purpose of the war fund and official guarantee. You're right. But the grand councilor is, after all, a Tokugawa man. So we don't know what he's really thinking. That's why the ronin who are as hungry as wolves are the right people to topple the Tokugawa in the revolution. And, if we put all the men together and use their powers, they will be stronger than iron. Your idea is very good. But the Kishu clan is like a rock at the top of a hill, so if we push them a little, they'll roll down the hill themselves. Right now, if we try to stimulate them, our actions can stymie their plans. This situation is very serious. When will they make their move? I recognize this handwriting. I'm afraid, it is not a good time for you to hear this news about the shogun. We're trying to find out who sent this paper, but we don't know yet. Never mind. Let them do whatever they want to. Well, that aside... what will the Kishu do? Who's there? It's Kirigakure Saizo. I'm sorry for coming so late at night. What's going on? The shogun is already dead. What? The shogun...? The government plans to keep the news secret. I'm sure this is a shock to you having been his right hand man. The heir, letsuna, is only 11 years old. And now, Roju Minister Izunokami's plots will escalate. He will manipulate the shogun, and when he finds mistakes that daimyo have made, he will have them stripped of their power and position. The world is in trouble! Grand Councilor. Yui Shosetsu and ronin from all over the land are waiting. So please, make up your mind soon! The fire is getting close to you. Can't you feel the smoke getting in your eyes? Can't you feel a sword pointing at your heart? You must harden your heart. Why don't you use your inner strength to get rid of the fiery sword of Lord Izu? Your energy will affect the entire land, giving voice to the ronin who hate the shogunate, and they will turn the world upside down! Grand Councilor, the time has come! Please make a decision! Please, you must decide! Give this official seal to Shosetsu personally. Sir! My lord. This is... I won't write anything down! I don't care what Shosetsu writes down. It's up to him! Hyogo... I want you to give me your life. Sir? If that official sanction falls into government hands, tell them that you took my seal, and commit hara Kiri! If my lord wishes, this Hyogo's life is yours. Please do that! Prepare the war fund, please! I know what to do. By the time we've fought the first third of a war, can we predict the winner? Yes. I've waited patiently. And I have tried to control my feelings, but Izunokami is coming after me little by little! Hyogo, even if he is a spiritual friend, we can't trust him! Sir! For Yui Shosetsu from the grand councilor, this is the 10,000 ryo war fund. And this is his official seal. On behalf of Yui Shosetsu, I, Kanae Hanbei, will accept this. We don't care what he writes about gathering ronin. But, I'm afraid that we must write it in front of an official. This is what the grand councilor said. Makino-dono, you must be ready for whatever may come. My life is worthless. It is the same as falling leaves. 1am in a different position, but I feel the same as you. What? Did they give an official sanction and a war fund? On behalf of Yui Shosetsu, Kanae Hanbei went to Kishu and personally received it. Saizo, you have done it! You idiot! You let Kirigakure steal the war fund and official sanction! How could you come back to Edo? It's the ninja's shame! This is shameful! That's enough, Genshinsai! He made a mistake because you, too, are a fool. What do you mean? I'm saying that it's you who should be ashamed of yourself! Oran-sama, why don't you fight with Kirigakure? Are you afraid of him, because he's the Sanada clan's top man? You've got a big mouth! I don't need you to tell me what to do! Sir Kanae, go to Osaka. Sir! Kato, to Kyoto. Sir! To Edo, Marubashi. Sir! I'm going to Mt. Kunou in Sunpu with Kumagai, and I will raise an army. Now is the time for us to act. By the way, if the Kishu army attacks Edo, we must join up with them immediately. We have to attack the shogun's army at Hakone checkpoint. Everyone, be supportive, be speedy and be brave! Sir! Princess... this grave is where my father's hair is buried. Saizo-dono was just like a father to me. My only family memories are about your father because I don't remember anything at all about my own family. Saisuke, I'm glad you brought me here. I brought you here to remind you that you are the daughter of Sanada Yukimura. Why is that? You're acting more like Lord Izu's daughter, but what duty has he asked you to perform? Saisuke... What are you saying? Lord Izu took away an innocent girl and raised you to become his puppet. Don't you know his plot? I took nothing from the Toyotomi and Sanada families. Maybe my natural father was a famous figure, but he did not lovingly raise me from childhood. Princess, I know, but... Do you mean this is the destiny of a child born in the Warring States period? After losing my family and being orphaned overnight I became a fugitive and never knew the love of my father and mother. Princess! Saisuke... when I look at a flower or listen to a babbling brook, and like just now, watching the beautiful sunset, I always remember the life we had in Iga. We had fun in Iga. We had peaceful days and knew nothing about hate and sadness. I wish I still had that. But 14 years have passed and life is different now, whether I like it or not. And now, I must think of Izunokami-sama as my father. Princess. If it wasn't for the love he gave me, I would probably be just a poor entertainer now. Itisn't love, it's a plot! And it's worse than getting killed! I believe I must continue to live, no matter what! Even if he takes away your pride and honor? Princess, I can help you. So please, get away from him! Let's stop it. The Yuri you knew is no longer in this world. I have my own life to live now, as do you. Sayonara, Saisuke. A man who is in his prime, he will never return. Sensei, I wish you luck! You, too! Do your best! After a long time, I want to dance! Kanae, please sing. I'm going to dance! What...? It's a woman! A monster! Put her in the shed! Sorry to make you wait. Please forgive me for showing up so suddenly. I've been ordered here by the grand councilor. It is very troublesome! You gave Yui Shosetsu an official seal and 10,000 ryo! How do you explain? It was a plot to deceive Yui Shosetsu. It seemed like a good idea. What about the war fund? And giving an official sanction is a surefire means to success. What will you do? I am the one who did it, so no matter what happens, it was my decision! I see. However, we can't be careless. Inside the grand councilor's head there are second thoughts about taking over the land. Or maybe this is just my overreacting. Hey, Kirigakure-dono! Why don't you drink with us? Here. Thanks. Kishu is too slow. It can't be. Because we heard that the Kishu had started taking action. That's why Sensei has already left Edo. And he said to thank you. What, Yui-dono has left? Where to? - Sunpu. It's right between the east and the west, and he will take over Sunpu. Then he will go to Mt. Kunou for the victory. At this time, everybody will start to take action! I never thought that Yui would leave Edo. I told him that I would take care of Edo. I'll bring 500 ronin with me, and we'll attack Edo Castle. Who sent you to sneak in here? We'll torture you if you don't tell us! Who is it? Oh... it's a Matsudaira spy. A woman... ho, a monster! - A woman? - Yes. Damn it... the bitch! What's wrong? She bit her tongue off and killed herself! What? Don't bury her! I will take the remains to Lord Izu. Hey! Let me off here! Sir, Matsudaira-sama's house is... Here will do! Very good! It was a good job using a bag of fake blood to make it look like you had committed suicide, but you can't fool me! I have to reveal one more of your tricks! Yes, it's Princess! Saisuke, you are also a ninja. Don't think of me as Princess Yuri and give me your pity! The game of Koga and Iga is over! Go ahead and kill me! Saisuke! Princess... you've tried to kill me a few times. Was it because you really hate me? Even if Yuri wants to love you, Oran is a Koga ninja! The ninja are not allowed to love anyone. I was going to kill myself with this blade after I killed you. I hate lzunokami for making you a woman like that! I feel sorry for you! Princess, do you remember that the blade you are holding was given to you as an inheritance? And that my father said, "The blade that a ninja has in his heart must be double edged." What he meant was like a double edged blade we can never break off, and betray the others. We must know who is lying, who is righteous and be honest! Princess... you must discard this wrong way and turn over a new leaf. It's too late. No, it's not too late yet! You can leave Edo without Izunokami or the Koga knowing. And you can throw away this wrong lifestyle, and find the happiness of a woman. The happiness of a woman? The true Princess Yuri is living in my heart always. Saisuke. Princess. Take care of yourself! Oran, don't you know the rule of the ninja? Don't tell me what to do! Lzunokami-sama ordered me to keep an eye on you! So I've followed you since Saizo showed up. My lord, Genshinsai is here. I heard that Oran was captured at Yui's dojo. How did you know about that? I know everything that happens in Edo. Especially when it comes to Yui's dojo. It surprised me that Princess Yuri and Saizo were childhood friends. Yuri kept this secret. We can't use a ninja who is in love! Genshinsai, I'll let you handle everything from now on. Sir! It's a great honor! I, Genshinsai, will do anything for you, my lord! By the way, what should I do about Oran? Use her well! Sir..? She is good bait. Use her to lure Saizo here. MONTH 6, THE YEAR 1651 Here. “THE WOMAN IS BEING HELD CAPTIVE BY LORD MATSUDAIRA" Saisuke! - Princess! - Stay back! This is what a traitor gets! This is our Koga ninja rule! Kirigakure, if you don't want the princess to get killed, drop your sword! Listen, Oran! Keep your eyes open and watch as I throw! When I throw this last knife, your heart will stop. You finally got caught, Saizo. When I look at you, I am reminded of 14 years ago at Shimabara. You are as great a ninja as your father! But Saizo, times are different now. The world isn't going to change now, ho matter how hard you try. Shimabara probably was the last great battle we will have. What are you saying? 1 want a proud young lion like you on my side. An expert at ninja skills. Saizo... Please consider coming to work for me. I'll give you anything you want. No, thank you! I'm not fighting to gain fame and success! Didn't Tokugawa's Rokuohan teach you? 1 didn't learn ninja skills to help the Tokugawa! If a single wolf bares his fangs at his prey, it will end up as a waste of time. The battle for power is a constant struggle, but you will have your place. That struggle is like a monster that devours people's courage, and will crush their conscience like an insect. But you can never make the struggle disappear! Just like this iron railing, if something is made by man, it can be made to disappear. Only the emperor can tell the government what to do. The ronin are dissatisfied with the political situation, and they've united in order to fight the shogunate. Saizo, I will show you the power this government has to crush rebels! In a little while, the ronin will be attacked by the Kishu army and the ronin will be destroyed. Saisuke! Princess Yuri! - Saisuke! - Thank you! Guards! Halt! Damn...! Kirigakure, they found out about it! I don't know how they found out! A dog! An lzunokami dog spied on us! - A dog? - That's right! Who is it? - I know... - Who...? I'd better not tell you. I'm going to take revenge on that betrayer! Over there! Last night, between midnight and dawn, we raided the Yui dojo, capturing Marubashi Chuya along with 120 other ronin. We also caught another 350 ronin hiding in Edo. And we killed 175 more. What did you do with the leader, Yui Shosetsu? We were told that at about 2 A.M. in Sunpu at Toroemon's place, he, along with 8 of his men performed seppuku. Are you sure it was Yui Shosetsu? Yes, sir. A Sunpu official confirmed it after examining the body. Very well. You did a good job! - Thank you. I was waiting for you. I heard that Yui Shosetsu performed seppuku last night. Therefore, from now on I shall call myself Tachibana Ukyo, a Sagami samurai of 10,000 koku. I'll give you the grand councilor's official seal, along with 10,000 ryo in exchange as promised. Oh, I see. Is that an official seal? Even Yui Shosetsu was tricked by Lord Izu. What? You put your life on the line to get this official sanction, but it's only a worthless piece of paper! That's nonsense! This is the grand councilor's chop! Yes, it's his chop, but that seal was imprinted by Makino Hyogo on his own. It's the same as counterfeit! They reported that the war fund of 10,000 ryo had been stolen! This trick was set up by lzunokami and Grand Councilor Yorinobu! Makino Hyogo was ordered to commit seppuku. You and Hyogo were just pawns in their plot, but you were taken in by their positions of trust. Besides Hyogo, how dare you step on the poor ronin to try and gain wealth! Are you a dog? An animal? Be a samurai and commit hara Kiri! Only a dog understands what is inside a dog's heart! This is about Grand Councilor Yorinobu secretly giving the ronin Yui Shosetsu an official seal and a war fund of 10,000 ryo. We want to know if this is true or false! If I say it's true, what are you going to do? This is a very serious matter, even though you are in a highly ranked position, we must arrest you and give you a strict judgement! And if I say it's false? There are people saying, "There is no smoke without fire." So, if it's true, you'd better tell us now! Very well. It is the truth. But it was done without my knowledge. Makino Hyogo planned it all by himself. Everything came out in public, so Hyogo committed seppuku, as did the ronin, Yui Shosetsu. Now, you're questioning me about this, and it is unpleasant. How do you feel about your retainer committing such a crime? You must appear in the court to say you knew nothing of this crime and convince His Highness! Grand Councilor Yorinobu did not know anything about this. So it's not necessary for him to appear in court, even if the man was a member of his household. I know the grand councilor's character better than anyone. It's just like this, "Turn a misfortune into a blessing." He always supports the shogun, and everyone must help each other for peace and the success of the Tokugawa. That way, everything will end happily for all. SAIZO Compared with the beauty of nature, we saw only the ugly human kind, all made up of lies! Saisuke... I am so ashamed. No, it's me. Izunokami's plotting was far superior to the knowledge of the ninja. The era of human knowledge instead of weapons is here now. To destroy the power of the Tokugawa, I must keep training my soul. Lord lzu is an awful person. A powerful man is always looking for a victim. He finally lost his princess, but he must have realized that while he could create a flower, he couldn't redesign one's soul. Saisuke, what are you going to do now? I'm going to be alone and flow with the clouds and look for something. That's just what I need now. Saisuke, I am... Princess, good luck! Special Thanks to: Ichiban and Batman THE END
