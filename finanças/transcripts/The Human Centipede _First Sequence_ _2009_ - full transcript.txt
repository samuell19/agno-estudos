What's going on, girls? I know you girls. I've got a horny video of you at home. You're always wet between your legs, right? I can do both of you at once. I'll fuck you good and hard. Would you like that? Do you want to fuck or not? This is Dr. Heiter. Sorry to call you so late. But there's a problem. I've got two girls from New York. They're having car trouble. That's just great. Yes, thanks a lot. Bye. God damn it! Be careful, will you!? Stupid cow! Is there something wrong with your eyes? Idiot. Who the fuck are you? Where the fuck am I? What is this? Answer me, what is this!? Untie me, God damn it! What are you doing? Why the fuck did you tie me up? God damn it, untie me you freak! Who the fuck are you? Why the fuck are you doing this!? Why are you doing this!? Where the fuck are you going? The Japanese possess unbelievable strength when backed into a corner. The Japanese possess incredible strength when backed into a corner. What... What are you going to do with us? You're a crazy Nazi. I'll get you, you dirty German madman. Just you wait and see. Your knots won't hold me forever! Shut your mouth and untie me! Just you wait until I get my hands on you. What are you babbling about? You really think you'll get away with this? Hey, hey, just a minute, just a minute. Just, just, just a minute... Please stop! Shit! Who the fuck runs the electricity around here!? Do you really think you're God? Make it all go away, please. Stop this. Stop it now. Turn it off! How dare you lock us up here? You crazy idiot. You'll regret this, you filthy asshole. European madman. Goddammit, let us out! Now! We are not animals... To be caged! I am not a dog you madman. Now what? What the hell are you doing? Just die! That's what you get. I'm not your goddamn dog. I'm not a dog. Do you get off on this? This is your fetish. Oh no... Shit. I have to shit. I have to shit. Forgive me. Help us! Help... Yes, hello? This is the police. We want to talk to you. One minute... Help us! Please, anyone! We're in the cellar! Hello... Mr. Heiter... Good day. Police... This is my colleague Voller. And I'm Detective Kranz. May we come in a moment? Of course. Come in. Thank you. Take a seat. How can I help you? Mr. Heiter, people are missing. Their vehicles were found in your neighborhood. Perhaps you could tell us more... I'm afraid you've come to the wrong house, you see... I'm so busy at the moment with my research and writing... That I hardly leave the house. Gentlemen... Can I offer you something to drink? Coffee, if you have any. I'm afraid I don't have time for coffee. Water is all I have. Mr. Kranz... Thank you. Mr. Voller... So tell me, what do you want to know? Mr. Heiter, we know you're an international first-rate surgeon and we don't want to disturb you... But our investigation has hit a dead end. And, you're a suspect. I expect you have your reasons. But I have neither the time, nor the patience... For the banality of missing persons. What is that cage being used for? Could you get to the point? A witness... Heard a woman... Screaming on your property. An American woman. Can you explain that? Absolutely not. I have no idea what you're talking about. Your silver-colored Mercedes was seen, at the place where the abandoned Dutch truck was found. What do you think? You think there's a connection!? Oh the nerve you guys have to suspect me! Finish your drinks and get out of my house! I need you out of my house... I have work to do! Take it! Come on. I need you out! Take it! Drink up! You will regret that! I'll see you in court. You can count on being fired when my lawyer hears about this. My apologies. I overreacted. I'm overworked. I don't get enough sleep. I'll just get a towel. Help us! We're in the cellar! Come to the cellar! Help us! Dear Joseph, don't stress yourself. Everything will be okay. Come... What is down there... In that cellar? Now... You're going too far. Well what's in there? My laboratory, a small workroom, and a torture chamber. You're making a fool of yourself. Can we take a look around? Not a chance. Look... My research is off-limits to you... To everyone. Do you have a search warrant? I can have one in 15 minutes. I'll ask you again: What's in the cellar? What you're doing is illegal, as you no doubt are aware. Shall I call the police myself and tell them? When you show me a warrant, you may search my entire home. ... And what is this? That... Insulin. I have diabetes mellitus. We'll be back in 20 minutes with a search warrant. I think you're hiding something. If you want to waste the taxpayers' money... That's your call. See you soon. Fuck you! We have to get out of here! One, two! Okay? One, two, one! Come on! Two! One! Two! One! Two! One! Two! Come on! One! Two! One! Two! One! Two! One! Two! One! Two! One! Two! One! Two! One! One more... One! Two! One! Two! One... One! Two! One! Two! One! Two! One! Two! One! Come on! Almost there! Come on, almost there! Come on! One! Two! One! Two! One! Two! Almost there! One! Two! Almost there, faster! One! Two! Why here? Why are we in this room? Goddamn! Goddammit! Now what? Hey God... Are you God? I'm just... I'm just a puny insect. I cast out my parents... Left my child without a parent. I dismissed their love, and led a selfish life... ... Just like an insect. In fact, lower than an insect. But... But dear God... That's how I've lived my life! And this is my punishment for living my life how I did! I'm just... ... Trying to believe... ... That I'm still a human being. Hey girls... Hey look, it's God... What a fucked up world we're living in. Police! Dr. Heiter, police! Dr. Heiter... Well, Goddamn it...
