This was dyed twice, three times, and five times. Granny! HER GRANDDAUGHTER Thanks. How's your grandma? Not good. At the hospital? Yeah. I was just about to go. How long are you here for? For the time being. Hello? Thank you for coming. Thank you. This is delicious. Sorry for the wait. It's hard to believe. She went so suddenly Lucky you were around, Tsugumi. Maybe she brought you here. She was fond of you. Come have a drink. You've done enough. Take a load off. Got plates? Yeah yeah. Has she got a man? I wish I knew. We never shoulda let her go to Tokyo. All her classmates are married now. Tsugumi's working her butt off in IT in Tokyo, so she don't need to marry some loser. That's bull. Tsugumi, you're doing too much. You oughta have a rest. I'll take over, so go have a drink. Thank you. There you go. Sorry for the wait. Yay drinks! Thank you! Hey Sis, when did you get here? None of our family knew. What? You take after Grandma. Really? You all better take care of yourselves too. Stay well and live long, Kayo. Thank you. You'll stay here a while? Remember to lock up and put out the fire. See ya. Atelier Towa Nice weather. Could you get me a coffee? It smells good. Oh, the author Shogo Kawamura died. At 47, of lung cancer. And he wasn't even a smoker. You know, I read the obituaries first. Seeing someone younger has died makes me feel lucky. Um... Do you live around here? Delicious. Well...? I moved into the annex last night. Last night? Didn't Towa tell you? Oh. She didn't. I'm Jun Kaieda. Kaieda... I teach philosophy at Kadoshima U. If you moved in, how'd you get a key? She gave it to me years ago. So I could drop by anytime. I read in the newspaper three days ago that she died. I was at the funeral, but you wouldn't have seen me. Too many people. Um... How did you... know my grandmother? How should I put it... Anyway she gave me a key. Your grandma used to teach dyeing at university. I was one of her students. That's all. Wait a minute. This is my grandmother's house. Listen up. You may be her grandchild, but it's not yours yet. She gave me a key so I've got as much right as you. I'll make my own meals in the annex kitchen. Gotta go buy smokes. What was Grandma thinking? At her age... 'Morning. The stove in the annex is busted. Seen my specs? OK, you offered, so here I am. Let's eat. You make a fine misc soup. A bit strong though. Don't be so nervous. I saw 'em two nights ago. Huh? They were out, so I had to look. At your boobs. More please. Hey. Hey. I found your underpants. Oh. A quick wash is fine. That's not what I meant. You're interrupting my work. Tsugumi! You're living with some old guy? No I'm not. He is staying in the annex? Haven't you got things to do? I'm talking with a voter. So, who is he? An old friend of Grandma's. Teaches at Kadoshima U. Hey he could be a conman and a murderer. Could be. I'll stop by to pay my respects! Hey I was just at your place. Who's the guy in the annex? A murderer! Oh. So you're gonna marry Tsugumi? Yes. I'm planning on it. Welcome back. Kayo, you've got it all wrong. This guy... Squid, caught fresh this morning. I can't eat it all. Bye now. See ya later. Kayo, listen... I know, I know. Why say that? Why not? Your neighbors won't worry if they think you're spoken for. I'm not going to marry you. I said I'm "planning on it." No classes to teach? Summer holidays. Kayo had good timing. I love squid and radish stew. Take it. Take it. I'll cook and do laundry We'll split the food bill. You chop firewood and fire up the bath. I ain't chopped before. It's easy Watch it. You've perked up. This is good. Well seasoned. More please. Ever go to a salon? You're not bad looking, but you don't make an effort. I teach lots of girls so I know every kind. You don't say. Guys won't go for you if you act all surly. I bet they don't. I've seen your type before. Okay. Practice being romantic with me. You must've gone senile. Go take a bath. You first. Now you're being nice? Going second is best. Welcome! You're a local now! Yeah, totally It's so far away But the ride's cool. It was fun? Oh boy. Not again. What does that mean? You let him stay You're stuck in your usual pattern. I bet he's married with kids. He's nothing to me. If your grandma gave him a key, they must've been... Don't put that image in my head. Nakagawa's getting divorced. Wow. Everybody's good? Everybody? Komine, and the others. Well, is he? Why Komine? Now, where is it? What? Over here! No, no! Cut it out! How long will you stay here? Well... Still can't get over Nakagawa? I don't think about him. Time to focus on your own happiness then. I am, that's why I'm here. Tsugumi, you don't play fair. How come? You're a hard worker, and people like you, but you balance that out by falling for unavailable men. I do? What a bitch. I don't know what happiness is. I'm tired of hating myself, and denying myself. So Mr. Kaieda, you teach at Kadoshima University? Philosophy department. You're from Kansai? Born in Kyoto. And raised there. So, does your wife know you're here? My Wife? I'm single. You're divorced? I've never been married, OK? Really? Want me to send you my family register? No that won't be necessary I beg your pardon. I can't. I've never done it. - I can't! I can't! - Just try I can't. I'm scared. You can do it. Why? Why? Why me? Ready... Go! Is this right? Again. The way you scream! You're not gay are you? You're not gay? Why'd you ask? When you screamed... He's a nice guy You've changed your tune. It could be fate. Gimme a break. Akimoto, wasn't there something you wanted to say to me? Yeah. I'm gonna marry Komine. Huh? He broke up with his girlfriend. Oh. So I thought I should go for it. Congratulations. Don't turn on the lights. I want to die. How'll you do it? I'll jump from a tree out back. If you're gonna jump, jump in this. I hate cleaning up. Oh, theater director Shotaro Ueda died. At 49. Hung himself. His rumored affair became a scandal. What an idiot. Why are you still here? I'll get my uncle to kick you out. Why don't you then? My grandma gave you a key. I hear you're getting over an affair. Want my advice? Akimoto... That blabberer. Who cares? Women can't keep their best friends' secrets. It's in their nature. To be vile. Finished chopping wood? My back hurts. It's hard work. Breakfast's ready. University business. Back tonight. Kadoshima University Letters to you from female students. Oh. You're so popular. There're always girls who like geezers. "Fossil hunters," right? "Fossil hunters"? Girls who like "fossilized" men. How rude. I'm far from a fossil yet. I know. Tsugumi! Aren't you busy? Listen, I've got a favor to ask. What do you think? It's mediocre, isn't it? The design and stuff. The text's too small, and it's messy... Anyway Mr. Tetsushi here said you're a hotshot from a global IT company so we're hoping for some advice. I know it's probably beneath you, but Mr. Tetsushi said he'd ask for us. Designs not my specialty... ...but I'd be happy to help. Are you sure? I am. Wow! Really? You'll really do dyeing? Yeah. Well I'll be. But you know, you're too good for the countryside. Can you get by? I'll be fine. Oh, drop me off here. Let's eat out sometime. Yeah, sometime. Towa was too young to go at 73. She was like my little sister, so I should've been the one to bite the dust first. I'm sorry What are you apologizing for? By the way, about the man staying at Grandma's house... I know. He's Towa's ex-boyfriend, right? Oh. So you knew. More or less. Both of us lost our husbands, so we talked to each other a lot. Kayo, aren't you lonely? I was married for 25 years. Now it's easier being alone. I eat what I like, watch TV... My leg's a bit wobbly though. If you ever need help, tell me. I'm not going anywhere. That reminds me. Can you make rice cakes? Sure. I've got tons of beans, so take 'em with you. I'll go get them. No no, it's alright. Listen, Tsugumi... If you find a good man, don't let him go. I ain't wrong, you know. 'Morning. I'm hungry Make me something. Oh no. What's wrong? My necklace fell off. Where? Well... I had it on near the river. Was it expensive? 500,000 yen. Never mind. It's just loser jewelry I bought myself. I'll make some food. You get the bath ready Dammit! What's "loser jewelry"? You don't value yourself. It pisses me off. At least say "Welcome home." Where did you go? In all that rain? Damn. I'm tired. Help me take off my socks. I'll go get a towel. Please don't. Beautiful. You were with my grandma. I can't. The bath should be ready Hey... That professor... Guys like him... get all the girls. But you know... Even if I lose the next election, my family'll still have mountains and fields. Hey wanna go to the festival tonight? Huh? The festival. Hey... you're good. Will you and Tsugumi get married? It's complicated with her. Tsugumi's a good cook, right? She is. She is? I knew it. Tsugumi's good at everything. But people like her get lonely too. I doubt somebody like me could fix that. I knew I never had a chance. Mr. Tetsushi? Oh it's Miss Namazuda, from city hall. Want to catch some goldfish? Well, I already did... Sure. Shall we? You came. Got it... Ah dammit! Envious? This isn't your bike. Who cares? I'll take it back later. Why... ...a loser like me? That "loser like me" talk is just false modesty A long time ago... I don't give a damn about your past. You can't go back, so why don't you see me standing here now. I won't leave you alone. Treat me like an old stranger, and cry on my shoulder. I won't mind. Hey! It's been a while! Let's take a photo! Come on now. Squeeze in. Here goes! Pardon my tardiness. Who's he? Beats me. I've yet to introduce myself properly My name is Jun Kaieda. I was a student of Mrs. Shimoyashiki. I'm a teacher, and I'm employed at Kadoshima University I met Tsugumi at the funeral service, and since then, I've been living here. And? I wish to marry her. You and my mother had a student-teacher relationship? For a time, I was in love with Mrs. Shimoyashiki. After I graduated, we remained friends. So why do you want to be with Tsugumi? She's a fine woman. Shut up! Why do I feel this way after being single all these years? Let alone, for a woman who's my teacher's granddaughter. I'm in love with her, simple as that. Pull yourself together! How about it, Kyoko? If they're OK with it... Our mother brought them together, so it's OK! Everybody's hungry right? Let's eat! 'Morning. I'm not going to marry you. Why? Hi there! Thanks. And this is for the professor. Sayoko Kaieda Only trust a man's family register. Forgive me. I've got to go see my family I don't mind. You can read it. I won't do that. Ow! Why?! Don't you know how old I am?! But... You... don't know what the letter says. Isn't it your wife telling you to come back? It says the woman who raised me... ...died half a month ago. Sayoko Kaieda and I are foster siblings. Really? Why would I lie? You won't go right away? I haven't been home for over 30 years. Sorry but would you mind leaving me alone for a while? Hello. Hello. And you are... who exactly? Makoto Tomioka. Yes. His mother's name is Harumi Tomioka. She lives in Yokosuka, and I called her mobile, but it's not in use. Yes... Oh... I see. I'll try calling again. It's OK. Thank you. Find out anything about his mom? She's a distant relative and a single mother. It seems Grandma lent her money once. She said she'd be back soon, and left. She must've abandoned him. What do we do? Inform the police. The police? She changed her number. She meant to abandon him here. How pathetic. Come on, that kid... I'm talking about his mom. That stupid cow probably found a new man. Your missing person report's gone through. We'll have the search widened in Yokosuka. Please do. So... what'll you do? Well... for now... OK, shall we go? We'll take him, for now. Understood. Right then, if you don't mind, please fill this in. Are you two married? We are. We're not married. So you haven't had sex yet. I've seen her boobs. Makoto, I'm sure your mom will be back soon. I'm not so sure. My mom always comes back. Maybe not this time. Shall we? No TV till after dinner. Hey! Hands off chopsticks till I say "Let's eat." Let's eat. Let's eat. Let's eat. What's first? What kind of food do you like? Hamburgers. Does your mom cook for you? She buys me food at the store. Anything I like. Eat what's put in front of you. Whether you like it or not. Don't want it? Don't eat. And say thanks for the meal. More please. Want some watermelon? That train leaves Tsurumi at 14:23 bound for Chikura. Wow, you know a lot. I read it over there. You like memorizing timetables? Makoto... Are you a trainspotter? I'm not. What's Yokosuka like? There are lots more trains than here. And they run at night. Trains bound for Fujisavva pass through Yokosuka at 23:50, 00:12, and 00:27. Mom comes home on them. That hurts! Stop it! Hey how's this? It sucks. Don't be picky You ain't paying for it. The cheapest'll do. OK. Pick it all up and stack it there. No dawdling. Be quick about it. You're eating for free, so you gotta work. Carry three at a time. Like a boy should. It's been a week. Your mom's abandoned you. Let's go. OK then... Let's go eat some snacks. Don't say those things. You're not stupid, but you lack imagination. He can't rely on his mom anymore. He has to be strong. Makoto's only 5. Even at 5, he can understand the situation he's in. What do you know about him? In this world, parents thoughtlessly abandon their kids. But whatever happens to them, kids love those parents. That's why they think they'll come back for them one clay But you know... Most of the time... ...it doesn't happen. It's better to get them to give up... ...before it ruins them. Have you seen Makoto? He's somewhere. I can't find him. His packs gone too. It's because of what you said! Don't cry! Gimme a break. I'm not crying! Seen a 5-year-old boy with a pack? Hmm, a boy? Haven't seen him. Hey! Makoto! You better not be hiding! I'm kidding. I'm not mad, so come out. Excuse me, have you seen a 5-year-old boy this big? Please ask at the service counter over there. Thank you. Hello? You like this? Makoto! What were you doing?! You worried her so much! Let's go. I'm starving. I see. Got everything? Yeah! Listen. If anything happens, write on the back and post it. Got it? I can't write. If you're OK, draw a big circle. Mommy! Sorry about this. Let's go. Hey Makoto. She took care of you, so say thanks to her. Lady thanks! You too, mister. Come on. Bye bye! Bye bye! Don't call out. Quit sobbing. Here. Here. It's a good thing. He can eat all the hamburgers he wants... He'll have gone off hamburgers now. He'll be telling his mom he likes your cooking better. I should've paid for a taxi. It's so hot! So, made it official yet? Let's eat. Let's eat. Let's eat. Do it before you have kids. Kids? But we're not even... I'm ready anytime though... You're my child, but you're a mystery Mom, I haven't told you this yet, but I quit my job. I know that. You've been here so long. I want to do dyeing here, like Grandma did. If you want to, that's fine, but how will you eat? I've got money saved. And I can always work at the supermarket. I'll get a loan to buy this house. I don't mind buying it. Really? Great! Mom, don't get confused... You're such a pain in the rear! Mr. Kaieda, you'll really marry her? It'd be my honor. How embarrassing! I'm honored too! Mom! Think of him as a hand-me-down from Grandma. Hey. Knock it off. Give it back. Hey! Give it. Give it, I said. Give it! Want to... ...go to Kyoto? Kaieda Motors I'm Sayoko Kaieda. Nice to meet you. Come in, come in. Long time. Indeed. Glad you made it! Come in. Mother, sorry I'm late. So, you're a big deal now. A university professor. Jun, let me look at your face. Wow, you've turned into an old man. Well, it has been 30 years! She's a funny one. The sukiyaki looks ready Let's dig in. Have one too. He may look old, but she's so cute. Come on, dig in. Let's eat. You beat eggs well. I sure do. Are you sure? An old guy like that? What was he like as a child? Quiet, and a good student. He was hard to figure out sometimes, but he was kind. Did girls like him? He got a few love letters in high school. And? He wrote replies to them, but later he said he got dumped. I asked what he'd written. He didn't know what to write, so he wrote everything he did that day No wonder they dumped him. Surprisingly good condition, huh? It's great. Isn't it? Our foster mother was a rich man's daughter. She never married, and took care of parentless children. The others were taken in by relatives or adopted, but Jun didn't want new parents. He stayed with Mother. Just like I did. When Jun was in his second year of high school Mother had a suitor. Then one morning, he wasn't around anymore. Let's take a photo. It's been 30 years. The camera's there. Don't push me! You look good in a kimono too. Why did you leave your foster mother? I'm not sure. I suppose I felt that I had no other choice then. I was just a kid. When I found out... that Towa had passed away, I... This'll sound odd... I was relieved. And... I was surprised I was relieved. I'd grown tired of unrequited love, more than I'd realized. Also... I was glad... ...I didn't have to be in love anymore. That's how I felt, I guess. Love is exhausting. I thought she was my last. That there was no passion left in me. I wanted to bury Towa's memory, and just fade away And then... ...I fell in love with you. I was resigned to it becoming another one-way romance. But now... Nakagavva... How did you... Did Akimoto tell you? She wouldn't. It took me a long time to find you. Oh, are you her father? I'm her darling. You married her? Just about to do that. My divorce went through. Marry me. Oh my god... Look we should sit and talk, so let's go in. What was that for?! I don't need a reason. Nakagawa? Nakagawa? Nakagawa! A blowout fracture. A fracture? It's alright. Your brain seems fine. Let's hold you overnight. I'll ask again. Marry me. You've got a child. What'll you do? My ex has custody now. I thought it'd be better for you. I know I put you through a lot, but there's only us now. I... ...wanted to get married... ...and it's all I thought about. We'll live the way you want. Tell me. What do you think? While I've been away from you... ...a lot... ...has happened to me too. I... ...won't marry you. Kaieda? Kaieda? You dummy! Why'd you help Nakagawa first? Come on, he was totally unconscious. It was like he'd died. It wouldn't matter if he died. You thought Kaieda'd never leave, no matter what? Little things like this happen between a man and a woman. But... ...what if he never comes back? Don't worry I'm sure he will. The powerful Typhoon 18 is now hitting northern Kagoshima, and heavy rain and winds are causing partial ﬂooding in Tsurumi City. There has been severe damage, and residents are evacuating. Police and fire services... Kayo! You there? Oh, Tsugumi! Come to my place. Landslides have started. Hear that? I'm sorry. If I'm going to die, I want to die here. Kayo! I don't want to lose both you and Grandma ls the professor back? Never mind that, hurry! I told you, didn't I? You've got to hold on tight to the one you love! I know. Come on. I'm sorry Kayo?! I'll get help! Dammit! Are you crazy?! Can you stand? Kayo, I'll carry you. Hold on. OK? Thank you! I'm reading your essays. "Advice for Adults." Don't bother. It's just crap I write for cash.
