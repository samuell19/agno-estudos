Oh really? - Yes. really. - Really? - Yes, really. - You illiterate. - You're the illiterate Your father's illiterate. What a scrawny wrestler! What happened? Weren't you going to hit him? What if he'd have died at my hands? To install Forget it. But who is he? He's a cook for the new person... who's come to stay in Mr. Pandey's house. Oh, so he's a cook. By blowing on the gas fire, my eyes have become blurred. Mrs. Turmeric is tough like a wife and fiery mother-in-law is the chilli Tell me, oh my saddened heart... how long will I be stuck with house chores and kitchen jobs? But not all days are the same. This will change for sure Don't be gloomy One day my destiny will brighten Seeing it, the world will become jealous One day my destiny will brighten My brother is well educated He'll soon end my bad days The bad days of eating these dried leaves To hell with these leaves! Stale bread and pickles on my plate When will I be rid of these? When will the days of poverty end? When will I get hot and fresh food so delicious?

If you want to sing peacefully... why the need to drop things while singing. What's this? - Madhav! - Yes, brother? What's that funny thing on your head? Take it off. Look. Mice ate my coat. Very good! They've uncovered the real you. You buy cheap pants and coats, easily eaten by mice. Give me another coat. Brother, did you get the job... or are you still just going around in this coat? You should know why I need to wear this coat. Nowadays it's difficult to find a job wearing ordinary clothes. Won't you have breakfast? - I'll eat later. You do something about those mice. Okay. [ __ ]! Where did that cat disappear? Where is she? To install [ __ ]. Brother, did you see my cat? Cat! Cigars? What nonsense! Who tied you up? Tell me. I'll tie him up. - Who tied you up? Tell me. - I did it. How cruel! What if it had died? Let it die. Every day it drinks all the milk in my house. Why should I care? You already mix water in the milk... so what's wrong if my cat drinks some milk? Mixed water? What did you say? Say it again. Isn't it obvious? Milkmaids do mix water in milk. How dare you call me a milkmaid. - Who calls you milkmaid? - The officer next door's cook. - That Brahmin chef? Yes. That cook, is it? Come with me. Where'd he go? I'll break his head with this spade. Pandit, don't you dare steal my pawn. I'll be back. Come with me. Let's go. Milkmaids, it is. You stupid cook! You drink the milk, drink it every day. But if the mice chew brother's coat... Hey, you the slave of cookeries! Come out! You idiotic Brahmin! Talks nonsense. Today I'll smash your head. Wait, you! I'll thrash you today. - I'll kill you! - I'll burn you! - You'll burn me, will you? Yes. - What did you call my daughter? - What? - What did you say? - What? - What did you say to her? - What? - You called her a milkmaid! - What do you call a girl selling milk? Queen instead of milkmaid? Think you're so smart? See this? It's a holy thread of Brahmin. By selling milk, a Brahmin doesn't become a milkmaid. My name is Maheshwar. Do you know? - I didn't know that. - Now you know. Yes. Then be careful. Yes. Let's go. Dad, you were going to smash his head, right? To install Forget it. Why waste time with this gas fire blower. Don't you dare call me a gas fire blower, okay? I'll show no mercy. Then should I call that person a governor, who's only a cook? Officer! Who's the officer? He is my elder brother. - Really? Yes. - I didn't know that. - Now you know. Yes. Then leave. Okay, we're going. And tell your daughter don't tie up my cat or she'll die. Let her die. Who cares? - L... - You keep quiet. - Why should I? His cat drinks the milk. Shut up! He seems to be a gentleman. What a gentleman. I understand people well. Do you understand? - Listen you cook. - Don't call me a cook. - I don't know your name. - My name is Madhav. Very nice name. So, brother Madhav, why do you keep a pet cat? So she drinks milk from our house? Not to drink milk but to catch mice. Did you hear, Kamla? It's for catching mice. Brother Madhav, it's about mice, right? - Then come with me. - I don't have time now. - I have to cook vegetables. Kamla will do that. - Kamla, you cook the vegetables. - I won't. - Just do it. Come with me. Listen to me. So brother Madhav, here the mice are so big. Listen to me. They can't be trapped... and our cat runs away on seeing them. They've dug up the whole house. And if they're seen at night, even humans can fall prey to them. - Really? Yes. Come I'll show you. Your cat just drinks milk... but these mice eat anything. Now what can I say? All Kamla's clothes are ruined by mice. - Really? See for yourself. Kamala! Open your bag and show your clothes to Madhav. I'll do no such thing. This girl is very short tempered. To tell the truth, I'm short tempered, too. My anger too is very bad. Didn't you see? It's Brahmin's anger that rises quickly and calms instantly. - Do you like to play? Yes. Then sit here, let's play. Why is this queen here? Pandit, you have definitely stolen my pawn. Tell the truth. No. I don't lie. - You're too much. Okay, give me the hookah. Pandey, let's play. Okay, set up the board. Let's start again. You're still here? The interviews are over already. I wanted to ask for feedback. - You'll receive feedback in two days. - Any hope for me? Your chances are good... because you're well educated. What salary do you expect? Not much, only 40-50 rupees a month. - The job pays 75 rupees a month. - Really? - Will you have tea? - No, I'll go home to eat. Oh, so you're hungry? - Should I get something for you here? No, my brother's waiting for me. - He won't eat without me. Okay. Return in two days. - What was the salary you said? 75 rupees. Okay. Madhav! To install Make it fast. I'll set the table. I'm so hungry. You? Where did Madhav go? I told him... Where's Madhav? He is playing chess with my father. Idiot! Madhav! Pandit, now make your move. You thought you could corner me. Now save yourself. You've trapped me. Indeed! You were playing your knight, weren't you? Now go ahead. Give me the hookah. Make your move, Pandit. Come on, move. Madhav! Oh, everyone keeps calling Madhav. The game is interrupted. But you stay here, Pandit. I'll be back. But don't steal any pawns, okay? - Watch him. - He won't touch a thing. - Oh, here's your hookah. Give me. I am coming! Come on, hurry up. Bring the food. Couldn't you have come later? Why did you return early? What early? Don't you know the time? It's 3PM. 3PM? I haven't cooked anything yet, brother. You've cooked nothing? Just wait. I'll cook something right away. I know. Wow! Everything is all ready. Who prepared it? That girl. She's too good. And is also attractive, right? Yes. - Did you see her, brother? - Yes, of course. She sewed up my coat. Really? She's a very good girl. Did you like her? - Yes, I did. - Good. Listen. Why was a milkman's daughter cooking for us? He's not a milkman, but a Brahmin. One doesn't become a milkman just by selling milk. What kind of literate are you? Good that she's a Brahmin, but why was she here? That Mahesh Pandey forcefully... What? Sent her here. My feet! Now I get it. You've got it wrong. - If that girl comes here again, I'll smack you. - Okay, fine Aren't you ashamed? I'll keep the door closed. I'll do it. You eat your food. Take this. Give it. Always scolding me. Dad, please give this salt to them quickly. Salt. What a good idea! Dad, I forgot to put salt in the vegetables. Good my dear. Now never add salt to vegetables. Pandit, don't move the pawn. To install Go ahead. Why are you standing here? It's useless talking to you. Wearing the holy thread and still you have shoes on.. Officers eat their food this way. What happened brother? No salt. Oh yes. She forgot to add salt. Eat the vegetables. Eat the vegetables. No salt in this either? Get salt. It's 3PM and I'm still hungry. Brother. Salt... - What? We're out of salt? I'll give you the curry without salt or vegetables. Oh no! Brother, what did you do? You threw curry on her! Tell her you did it. Why me? - Tell her you're sorry. Go. - Why should I say sorry? Sorry curry slipped out of my hand. No problem. I brought salt for you. Salt? Good. Please don't mind. - Has she gone? Yes. Give it. Here. What kind of man are you, brother? She came here to bring salt... and you ruined her clothes with curry. Mistakes happen. Hunger makes a man go crazy. Go crazy? My feet! Since she's a good girl, she didn't say anything. - What's her name? Kamla. Kamla. And he's Mahesh Pandey. That milkman. - He's not a milkman. Okay, he's a Brahmin. He belongs to our caste. The food is good. You like it? Yes. Eat some, brother. May I say something, brother? To install Go ahead. It's becoming difficult for me to manage the kitchen. Then? Therefore, I'm saying that to manage the house... a woman is needed. So, what can I do? You get married to that girl. Okay! So you're speaking of my marriage? So you won't have to cook and do housework. You broke idiot! You want your elder brother to get married. - So you won't marry? No. - No lady will come into this house? No. Will I manage your kitchen for my entire life? What else can you do? You're uneducated and have always played Tip-cat. - I understand. - What? Mother handed me to you for cooking and cleaning. You're not my brother, but my enemy. I'm your enemy? You're crying again? To install I'm not crying. Something got in my eye. Look at me. Are you angry? - Come on, smile. - How can I? Come on, smile. Who are you cursing? Something got burnt. Let it burn. - The rice was burnt. Let it burn. Don't you teach me. I'm a great chef. An excellent cook. Got it? Oh my gosh! My hand is burnt. What happened? You're a great chef, but you burnt your hand. - My hand is burnt, not yours. Let me see. Let me apply this. You'll feel better. No need. - Do you have any scrap cloth? No. Oh god! What now? Who'll make the meals? Oh! You tore my Dhoti! Now what will I wear? Tell your officer brother to buy you a new dhoti. Show your hand. What kind of girl are you? To install Forget it. I'll do it. If someone sees us like this and says anything, it'll make trouble. I can't tolerate anyone's comments. Please leave. I can't even wrap this bandage properly. A gas fire blower won't be able to do it. Give it here. I'll tie the bandage. - I told brother many times. - Told him what? To marry you. - Damn! - What the hell? My brother isn't an ordinary man. He's well educated. Marry him and then you'll understand. Madhav! Oh no. - To whom were you speaking? - No one. Again this girl is here. I'll... Don't talk to me like that. brothers. Wait.

By the grace of God, your daughter has come of age. - What? - Don't you want her to marry? Marriage? Yes, marriage. My daughter was too honest with you... - and now you're thinking of marrying her? See. I'll thrash her. Pandit! Kamla! Pandit! What did I say? Kamla! This milkman is brain dead. - Again you called me milkman. - What else should I call you then? I'm not marrying her. But I've chosen a man for her. - Man? Yes. - Really? Yes. He's a college graduate, has a good job and income. And he's very good looking. - His name? - You tell me who he is. - Your elder brother. Absolutely right. He must be joking with you. Pandey, making jokes is the habit in your family, not mine. Do you understand? Tell me, are you able to pay for the marriage? My income is hand to mouth. What can I pay for? Did you see, Pandit? He must have made lots of money... by adding water to milk and now is afraid to spend money. Pandit, get the horoscope. Today we'll arrange the date. - Today! Yes. Sure. Let's not delay. Yes. Look for an auspicious day. 3 plus 7 totals 10 and adds 10.20. Look Pandit, if Pandey doesn't have money to spend... then the expenditures must be limited, right?

Take this. Only ten rupees? Don't worry, I'll get new clothes. Don't worry, Pandey. With fair looks, I'm the blooming youth and as delicate as a flower Don't throw a sideways glance at me, my dear With fair looks... I don't know coquetry.

It's your daughter's marriage, right? Don't laugh. I'm very upset. Then should I cry at my elder brother's marriage? You cry. If you didn't have enough money... - then where did this come from? - I borrowed it. - Then repay it. - Where will I get the money? By mixing water in your milk. Aren't you a milkman?

It's my brother's marriage The cheerfulness of a house is from the housewife Two wheels are needed to drag the cart of life The cheerfulness of a house is from the housewife I saw a bachelor's house. It was so sorrowful Every corner of the house was wishing for a beautiful lady Everything in the house seemed to be mystified The cheerfulness of a house is from the housewife Two wheels are needed to drag the cart of life Marriage holds many virtues. It turns around a ruined life The one who gets married always gains a glow Along with the bride, her family is also added in The cheerfulness of a house is from the housewife Two wheels are needed to drag the cart of life Today I proclaim from the peak of Himalayas... marriage is must. No one should remain a bachelor No one should remain a bachelor Find a wife for yourselves No matter if she's fair or dark The cheerfulness of a house is from the housewife Two wheels are needed to drag the cart of life Come on, Pandit. - What a move!

Dhanbad? Yes. My younger brother works there in a coal mine. - Really? - I'm even thinking of settling there. Teaching doesn't work here. Pandit, can you get me some job there? And I'm smart, aren't I? Sure. You'll definitely get some job there. - So, you're coming with me, right? Why not? Of course I will, if I'm getting a job. I'm strong enough to work hard. Don't you agree, Pandit?? Sure. - Very sure? Absolutely sure! - Then when shall we leave? The day after tomorrow. Okay. Who's pbeating the drum? Take a look. Pay attention, people of the town.

I can take care of him myself.. - You go. - Brother-in-law... - Why are you being so insensitive? - Yes, I'm insensitive. But you have to leave. Go. Kamla. Dad! I told you to get vaccinated, but you didn't listen to me. Now die! Madhav? Pandey? Now I won't stay alive. You lived your life. You fulfilled all your duties. But you're still hoping for life?

From my bedroom I can see you working. So, do you watch me? No. I keep working and you keep watching me at night. Don't you get sleepy? Why? Some questions don't have any answers. We may find the answer while convincing ourselves. What are you thinking? I don't understand what you say. Do you really not understand? I wish I could express my feelings for you. Why don't you try to understand me? You mean to say you're in love with me? Really? If you ask this question to my heart, it won't lie to you. Also, the sleepless nights I spend thinking of you... will tell you the truth. But it's not possible, Mala. Why Shankar? Why not? Mala. Mala, you don't know I'm married and I have a daughter. It's impossible, Mala. I didn't know that. Forgive me Shankar.

You know what my heart holds Speaking to my heart was the only mistake I made Console me, you mates of my sleepless nights have made a mistake. Please don't taunt me Oh you stars in the sky, don't sneer at me I've made a mistake. Please don't taunt me Oh you stars in the sky... Forget it. I'll tie it. Why get angry at me? I am not literate enough to write down the address. Every day I go and check but the door is always locked No servants even. Be careful! It'll break. You might fall down. A woman doesn't die so easily. At least you should've asked for your brother's address. All the money's been spent. How can I run the house? How can I explain to him? If you look at him... he answers, why are you here? Go away. He acts all crazy in front of that lady. Which lady? That madam he works for. Brother-in-law, is she very beautiful? Yes she is, but not more than you. Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law! He didn't come, right? I knew he wouldn't come. He is a big scallywag. Did you realise, Buddhuram? No, it's Shankar. Oh yes! Shankar Mishra. It's written in my diary. If he comes, haul him over the coals. Hit him hard with hunter. Will you be able to do it? - Definitely. - Good. Then I'll be happy. Okay, now I'll go to the other room. He might be coming. Got it? Awaiting him is useless. Batuk won't come today. - If he doesn't come, I'll go to his house. - Alone? - What's there to be afraid of? - You don't know him. He's a very dangerous man. And I'm no less dangerous. Listen. If you want to go, then take servants with you. What's the need? Getting scared won't help me. - I have to do my duty. - What if something happens to you? If I've taken the responsibility, then I have to accomplish it. - Don't go, Shankar. Please don't stop me. No, I won't let you go. - But why are you doing this? - Promise me... you won't go anywhere without telling me. Greetings, Mr. Manager! Wow! Great! That's okay. Why are you late? Late? I think I came early. You were supposed to come at 9AM but now it's 12PM. Is it? Mr. Manager, here no one follows the clock. - This is a village. - If it was the city... I'd have been on time. To install Forget it. Now tell me why you've called me? I will, but first tell me why you're harassing Mr. To install Avinash. Do you know, he's scared of living in the village? Yes. I know that very well. But you only came here just four days ago, son-in-law. - Again you called me son-in-law! To install Calm down. I didn't come here to be threatened by you. If you want to threaten me then call your people. - Or should I call them? - I don't want any lectures. I just want you to answer my questions. Why did you create disputes over land and property? I'm not the only one involved. The father of your boss Avinash, Mr. Rai Bahadur Deep Narayan... stole all my land when I was very young. When I grew up, I saw that your boss Avinash... was controlling all the property and land... with nothing left for me. Therefore to get back my land, I started this dispute. And therefore you started harassing the landlords? - Why didn't you go to court? - Because it's expensive and time consuming. But if it's required, I will definitely take this step as well. Therefore, I've educated my son to be a lawyer. This situation would never have arisen... if Avinash had married his daughter to my son. There'd have been no dispute. When it didn't happen... You chose violence. - I wish I could... - Will you hit me? I'll smash you. You're being childish. Gone are the days... when one could prove his dominance on land with the help of hunter. You won't be able to do anything. If you continue with your flirting, you may find success in that. Shut up! I know very well how to handle goons like you. Get out of here! lmmediately! Okay. I'm going. I'm not here to stay. But what you did wasn't good, son-in-law. Rascal! What have you done! You shouldn't have insulted him. Then was I supposed to tolerate his nonsense? One doesn't need a manager to intimidate. That can be done by any peon or watchman. Then tell me what I should have done. If I knew what to do then I'd have become a manager. Why were you required? Mr. Shankar, you don't know how dangerous Batuk is. Therefore I didn't confront him. But you were wonderful. - What are you saying, dad? - I'm right. Today I'm so happy you can't even imagine. I've raised your salary to three hundred rupees per month. Come on. You come with me. Doctor, will my sister-in-law recover? God knows whether she'll recover... but did you get the injection I asked you to bring? No. - Then without medicine how can I help you? - What's it cost? Ten rupees. Go and get it. Doctor, I don't have anything, I don't know anything. Please save my sister-in-law. Then go and get the injection. What can I do? Doctor, you're like a God to us. I pray that you please save my sister-in-law. - Are you mad or what? I told you to get the injection. Then I'll save her. Now leave. Make it fast brother. Why have you brought this? You can go to jail for selling bronze as gold. Go. Bronze? Yes. Now listen to what he wrote. 'Tonight we've arranged a celebration at the temple. Since you're the richest landlord and our leader... if you'll grace our celebration with your presence... we'll be grateful to you. I hope you'll accept our request. Yours sincerely, Batuk Choubey. This is the result of you threatening him once. Let me convey this good news to Lata. She'll be very happy. - Who is Lata? - My daughter. - Her name's Mala, right? - Oh yes, Mala. It's written in my diary. Okay, I'll go now. You come with me. Mr. Manager, Choubey sir has specially invited you. Why? Since it's a party, there will be dancing and singing. No, no. - And what? - You should listen to it. And what! He warned me not to tell anyone. What? A song was written about you, which will be sung. Okay I'll attend. Go now. Okay. Glorious were the days... when the shy women... in front of strangers used to put on the veil Now the world is being spoiled so that... veils are called useless and ineffective a mere manager They were flirting with each other openly... as if the world was set on fire She returned from the city after being educated She'll spoil the village's culture and traditions And she will walk tall as a shameless lady Small is her look but big is her attitude Odd are her gestures and manners... as if the world was set on fire The daughter of a rich father has fallen for a mere manager They were flirting with each other openly... as if the world was set on fire Now listen to the story of the manager He looks just like a drifter I see Then what? Where did he get the money to dress well? He must be sucking up the wealth of his in-law's, I say Every villager is amazed by this farce As if the world was set on fire The daughter of a rich father has fallen for a mere manager They were flirting with each other openly... as if the world was set on fire Will we tolerate such offenses in our elegant village? No. Never Let's dishonor her father by making him feel ashamed Together we'll teach them a lesson As if the world was set on fire Shut up! Stop this nonsense! - What is this, Mr. Choubey? Nothing. These villagers are entertaining themselves by singing. By humiliating someone in their songs? We aren't humiliating anyone. We're just expressing ourselves about modern times. - Shut up! - Will you hit me? A devil like you must be thrashed hard. Son-in-law, you don't even know how to behave properly? My men are all around. If you'll become aggressive, you'll be beaten. How dare you! Gun! We'll see who gets beaten Come with me. Leave my dad. - Move or you'll die. Release him! Move Ramdas. I'll take care of it. - Save your dad if you're brave. Ramdas, you must go. Now let's see who comes to rescue you. You rascal! I'll kill you. - Leave him I say. Let him go. Mala.

Yes, Batuk might do anything. Hariram, tell dad we've both gone to Kolkata. Kolkata? Come on. Let's hurry up. Go. So, you're escaping? I was just going up. - Where's the criminal? - What criminal? I don't know anything. - Where's your manager? He left for Kolkata. No, I don't know anything. - What's his name? - His name is Jagannath. No sir. His name is Shankar Mishra. Oh yes! Shankar Mishra. It's written in my diary. He lives in No. 5, Kela Bagan, Kolkata. Shankar Mishra. He lives in No. 5, Kela Bagan, Kolkata. Yes. Okay. You come with me to the police station. - Police station?

Is uncle Madhav at home? Uncle's not at home. Really? - I'm here at the right time. Meaning? I mean I can speak with you freely. Don't you have anything else to do? This is all I have left to do. - Got it. - What? No. Ash! Listen to me. Ash! Listen to me. - Won't you? No. You'll just get mischievous again. In love one's allowed to be mischievous. - Only after marriage. Then let's get married. Listen to me. No. - Won't you? No. - Really? No. Now tell me, I've caught you. I let you catch me. How else could you grab me? However it happened, but today I won't release you. - What will you do? - I'll punish you. Look at me. No, I know your habits. Let go. - No. Let's go. - I won't. - Are doctors like this? Yes, absolutely. Don't talk to me. Uncle, I was... Doctor, why did you park your cycle here? It might get stolen. I forgot about it. Okay. I know how your mind wanders these days. Did you write a letter to your father? No. I was busy. But not too busy to flirt with my niece every day, right? Uncle, you're crazy. Yes I am. Your dad used to call me crazy. Your mother as well and today you called me crazy, too. That's fine, but I think I should get you two married soon. - Doctor? Yes? - You won't be able to do anything. Give me your address, I'll talk to your father. - You'll talk to my father? Yes. Why? You don't know that my father is very strict. Okay. Are you scared of him? Yes. But doctor, don't underestimate me. Give me your address, I'll set everything right. Then you do something. Go to Purandarpur station and ask anyone for Batuk Choubey. - What's the name? - Batuk Choubey. - Batuk Choubey. - Bandarpur? No. It's purandarpur. Purandarpur. To install Batuk Choubey. Purandarpur. Okay. I'll remember it now. To install Batuk Choubey. Purandarpur. It totals 75,000 left. We won the case. The court has also fined him rupees 5000/-, The court authorized us to auction all his property... in case he fails to pay the fine. I'm very happy. Finally my revenge is complete. I'll deliver the news to him. Tell driver to get my car. Okay. Now let's see what that devil has to say. Where is Batuk Choubey's house? The big house in front is his. Okay. You still don't know me. I know you well. Who doesn't know the man, taking advantage of helpless women... and stealing their land? But I'll show no mercy. I want the amount of 5000/-, plus the interest. You'll have a month to pay. You'll get the money. Right after my son gets married. I'll repay every single penny. Mr. Batuk, in this modern world... it's difficult to raise a dowry of rupees 5000/-. What's it to you? My son is a doctor. He has a good job. And his engagement is arranged, with the daughter of Balarampur's landlord. Okay. Pay me my 5000/- within a month. Otherwise I'll be forced to seize your land at Talapur. To install Take heed. I will. - Whose marriage? - Your marriage is difficult at your age... but I was talking about Madan. I mean doctor Madan. Oh lady! - He's marrying my niece. Let's see. Manager, we'll not give up our land in any case. Of course not. How can we? Excuse me bro. Let me finish first. Then you can continue. Mr. Choubey, you have to accept this proposal. - Are you forcing it on us? - Yes, I am. Then can you pay us 5000/-? Lignore him, manager. You know me, how am I, right? Are you a detective? Mr. Choubey, 5000/- is a small amount. I can lay down my life for my niece. If brother was here today, there'd be no problem. Whatever it is, are you going to allow this marriage? - Manager, what about that 11000/-? - First answer me. - I will. - Listen. - Will you approve the marriage? Yes, I will. Come for sure. I'll definitely come. Okay. Manager, the court papers... Look. You promised me. He must be some crazy man. I knew that he must have run away from a mental asylum. - Manager? Yes? - Inform Mr. Choudhary of Balrampur... - Yes. That this coming Sunday we'll hold the engagement ceremony of the couple. - Okay. - That's it. Why be shy? You beauty, it's the best day of your life Every girl has to walk with her partner in life Now get ready to leave this house and begin life with your spouse Today it's your turn. Tomorrow there'll be others, so don't get too proud Wedding day blossoms only once in a lifetime Every girl has to walk with her partner in life Why be shy?

To meet her love her heart is becoming eager Every girl has to walk with her partner in life Why be shy? You beauty, it's the best day of your life Every girl has to walk with her partner in life Madhav! You're standing here. But the meal isn't ready yet. - When will you serve the food? - Pandit... you're becoming impatient. Don't you remember that during brother's marriage ceremony... you behaved the same way? You'll ruin everything. Enjoy the music. Uncle, the groom is calling you. Why? He's getting impatient like Pandit? Let me see. Yes doctor, what's the matter? Why isn't father here yet? He promised me, so he'll come for sure. It's past time. I hope he didn't take you lightly and thought... That I am a crazy man? Did you hear, Pandit? See his craziness. Doctor, if your dad calls me crazy then he must be one, too. But without dad, how can this marriage happen? What are you saying, doctor? Everything's already arranged. The guests have arrived and the rituals are about to begin. Under these circumstances if the wedding is cancelled... then both you, Madhav, and your niece will be ruined. No. I was wondering why dad hasn't arrived yet. If your dad doesn't show up, then you won't marry? Will that be proper? No. Rather, is it proper to ruin my child... by not marrying her after agreeing to. Tell me doctor. Are you or your father marrying her? - The groom has been called to the marquee. - I won't go. We'll see about that. Malti, come on. Let go. I'm coming. Come on Mr. Groom. Go straight to the tent. You can't outsmart us. Okay. Come on. Now it's fine. Yes it is, but why didn't his father come? To install Forget it. Our job is finished. You just get some good food for us. Yes, to hell with the world but your hunger must be sated. Come on. First I'll serve you some food. Come in. - Come in. - Madam? Madan? Dad's here. What to do now? - Why are you scared of your father? - You don't know him. He can even frighten even a lion. - Really? Now what? Don't worry, I'll make things right. Will you? Yes. But first you'll have to agree that I'm the bravest. Not just once, but I'll agree a thousand times. - If you'll just handle my father. - Madam! Have a seat Mr. Choudhary. At an auspicious moment, we'll leave for the village. Yes. - Madam my child, send a glass of water. I'll tell you Mr. Choudhary, your daughter will be very happy. The atmosphere here is so beautiful. And also, grocery supplies are very cheap here. Milk, oil, etc., everything is good. - Have some water. - No, you have it. Who are you? I didn't recognize you, my child. Why would you? You're strange, Mr. Choubey. - Didn't you promise to come? - What promise? You've already forgotten? You promised to come for your son's wedding. Doesn't matter. I got my niece married to your son. Married? Yes! - She's your daughter-in-law. - What are you saying! I'm saying nothing wrong. You'll not find a more beautiful wife for your son anywhere. What an embarrassment! Okay mr. Choubey, everything's clear now. My car is ready. I'll take your leave. Bye. Listen to me! What can I do? Where is that scoundrel who's ruined the family name? He's here, hiding inside because of your anger. Doctor! Here he is. Madam, come here. Does this man speak the truth? Come on, speak up. Yes. Yes, dad. Better you'd have punched me, instead of humiliating me like this. I arranged your marriage somewhere else. Almost everything was decided and you got married here? Madam, get ready to come with me. This is really good. My child will get to see her in-law's house. Only Madan will come with me. - And my niece? To hell with her! How can any ordinary girl... be a daughter-in-law of the Choubey dynasty? Mind your language, Mr. Choubey! She's the daughter of my elder brother. Do you understand? - If brother was here... - Shut up! I don't have time for your gibberish. - Get ready, madam. - How can he? This won't happen. Along with your son, take your daughter-in-law also. After all, what's her fault? Your own son wished to marry her. Doctor, why are you silent? Say something. Okay. I'll take your niece on one condition. I'll agree to all you ask. Promise me you'll never ever set foot into our village. Yes. I promise. And if you step in, even by mistake, you'll be forced out. - Take heed. - Yes, I will. If my niece is fine, then why would I come there? My child, your in-laws are your parents now, okay? Won't you ever come to visit me? Why are you crying, my child? You'll live happily with your family... and even if I don't show up, it doesn't matter. After all, you'll still be my child, right? Uncle! Don't be disheartened, my child. Uncle! Don't be disheartened, my child. Greetings, Mr. Choubey! Greetings. I heard your son got married. And you didn't even think of informing me. So, she's the daughter of Balrampur's Choudhary? Don't embarrass me. My child, greet Mr. To install Avinash. That's fine, my child. Oh! I don't have any gift for you but take this, my child. Anyway, take this. Take it. It's like blessings from the elders. Your daughter-in-law is very pretty. Yes she is. But I was ruined due to a fraudster. No fraudster in this world can ruin you, Mr. Choubey. I hope you remember your promise. After your son's marriage, you'll repay my money. Yes, I remember. Come on, my child. You also remember, if you fail to repay, what'll do to you. Yes. I remember that too. Come on. Idiot, because of you, I have no place to show my face. Don't worry, dad. I'll repay all your debts with my earnings. You will. But there he is, ready to seize our lands. But we won't let him. Dad, you be careful... No money and no land. What are you talking about? Just look at it. Okay, let's see. Sure. What a headache! Uncle Madhav, are you still asleep? - The whistle has already blown. - Ignore it. You've been absent for fifteen days. Aren't you afraid of losing your job? Our heart feels fresh if we keep working. Not me. I've retired from work. Asha was here with me, so I was working. She got married. Now I've retired. Now I'll do whatever I want. Who's to stop me? Madhav! This Pandit will bother me. Tell him I'm not well, - I won't go to work. Madhav. Madhav, you're resting here. Come on, wake up. - Let me sleep. - You won't go to work? - Go away, Pandit. - Yes, I will. But Madhav, in this morning's mail... is a letter from Asha. Asha's letter! Let me see. Did you notice, Pandit, how good her handwriting is? After all she's the daughter of my well-educated brother. My child Asha's letter! Pandit, this is the first letter I've ever received. My child Asha's letter! My child Asha. Read it, Pandit. She wrote, 'Greetings to respected uncle.' - Stay blessed, my child. - 'I'm doing very well, ' - ' The house is very big.' - Of course. 'All love me very much.' Why not? - 'But I'm missing you a lot. I wish to see you. And I want to see you, my child. 'I've not been feeling well for a few days.' - What! - 'Your daughter, Asha.' Read it again, Pandit. 'I want to see you. 'I've not been feeling well for a few days.' Not well! 'I want to you, uncle.' Not well! Pandit, Asha must not be well. It's a virus. No need to worry. You don't understand, Pandit. If she wrote... then she's definitely ill. You know how frail this girl is. I'll go there, Pandit. But you promised you wouldn't. Yes I did! But I can't stay back if my child isn't well. I'll go there, Pandit, even if they throw me out.. Even if they humiliate me. But I'll definitely go there. Ash! My child! Uncle! Ash! My child! Uncle. - How are you, my child? - Fine. I couldn't stop myself after reading about your ill health. - Are you fine now? Yes, uncle. But we have a big problem here. Problem! Where's Madan and the other family members? They've gone to fight with the landlord. - Fight? - Both sides have called their men... and it's a very serious matter. Madan and your father-in-law have both gone there? Then I have to go, too. Madam! Uncle, why did you come here? There are riots going on here. To install go home. Why? Do you think I'm old? Not like that, uncle. Their men outnumber ours. - We can't compete against them. - And you're fearful? What's there to fear? I'll take them on. Give it to me. Uncle! Come on, come with me! Mangal. Who is this old man? He's fighting very energetically. We need to stop him. He's coming this way. Hide. Uncle! - Boss! - What is it? We seized the land... but we've got an injured man with us. - Where is he? Lying in the garden. - Yes. - Why'd you bring him here? - What if he testifies against us? Tell us what we should do. Kill him and bury him somewhere. Okay, boss. What happened? Who have you ordered to be killed? - A man from Batuk's team. - You ordered him killed? Yes. Where are you going? - Ram Singh will kill him. - I ordered him to. I can't let this happen. I won't kill anyone over land. Mala! Mala! Ram Singh! Jaggu. Ram Singh! Leave me. Leave me. Hold him tight. Shut his mouth. Leave me. Ram Singh! Jaggu! Ram Singh! Jaggu! Leave me. - Ram Singh! Madam. - What's going on? Boss ordered us to kill that man and bury him. Stop all this. But it's an order. - I say stop this. Ram Singh. What is it? - Why are you silent? Madam stopped me. I stopped him. Mala, I told you not to interfere. Go. How dare you! Don't do this. Mala, you don't know that... the person your father worried about... was responsible for me spending fifteen years in jail. I had to leave my brother and daughter. It doesn't mean you have to kill someone. - I won't let this happen. - You don't understand, Mala. If Batuk comes here and finds him dead... it'll become difficult for me. I'll go back to jail. Go! Ma'am? - Useless fellow! Move. - No, don't do that. No. Move aside, Mala. Brother! Madhav! Madhav! Brother! I was going to kill you! Where were you? I looked for you everywhere. We've met after sixteen years, Madhav. Madhav, what if I'd killed you? Brother, now I've found you. You're injured, Madhav. Brother! You've grown so old. Even your mustache has turned white. You look older than I do. You made me old. Uncle! Where's my uncle? Please release him. Tell me where is he? Ash! My child! Uncle! Ash! - Uncle! - My child! Uncle! You're still bleeding. Let it bleed. I'm repaying your dad with this blood. Brother, this is your daughter Asha. - Batuk's daughter-in-law? Yes! I married her to doctor Madan. My child, he's your father. - My daughter! Father. You were so small! Mala, do you know who he is? He's my crazy brother, Madhav. Sister-in-law. Meet my daughter, Asha. Come, my child. He's still bleeding. Let me see. Ram Singh! Quickly call the doctor. Come, Madhav. This is Shankar Mishra. He injured my relative. Arrest him. Who are you arresting, Mr. Choubey? Enough of this. If you'll act smart, I'll have you arrested, too. Do you know who he is? He's my elder brother. - Your older brother? Yes! Didn't I say my elder brother is wealthy? Shankar Mishra is your elder brother? - Yes. - And Ash? Asha's his daughter. Oh god! That means I was fighting my relative? Mr. Shankar, please forgive me. Now there's no question of any disputes, Mr. Choubey. I have everything and the happiest thing is... after sixteen years, I finally got back my younger brother. Brother, for your entire life you held me captive. But now I'm free. Totally free. How can I set you free? Don't you remember, you used to call me your enemy? Yes. Madhav, now I'll capture you with love... in the corner of my heart that was deserted. Brother!
