Are you sure you don't want to get in the water? Later. Did you know that over there there was a boardwalk that a bunch of people came to? Like Caetano Veloso, Gal Costa, a bunch of intellectuals, left-wing people... They were there making music, talking about politics... That place must have been amazing. Cool. I wish I had lived in that era. Do you guys want to play that game, "I went to the market"? You say, "I went to the market and bought a banana." Then, someone else says, "I went to the market and bought a banana and an apple." And the other: "I bought a banana, an apple..." No, for the love of God, not today, these games? What's up? What's wrong with my games? They only work late at night, when everyone is drunk and too lazy to go home. I think it is a good way to pass time. A good way. I went to the market and bought a tomato. I went to the market and bought a tomato and a chicory. I went to the market and bought a tomato, a chicory and a fish. Now me, I went to the market and bought a tomato, a chicory, a fish and lychee. I went to the market and bought a tomato, chicory, fish, lychee, and a pineapple. I went to the market and bought a tomato, chicory, fish, lychee, pineapple, and a grape. I went to the market and bought a tomato, chicory, fish, lychee, pineapple, grape, and custard apple. I went to the market and bought a tomato, chicory, fish, lychee, pineapple, grape, custard apple, and indigenous arts and crafts. I went to the market and bought a tomato, lychee... No, sorry. Let me... I went to the market and bought a tomato, -chicory, lychee, right? -C'mon, dude! I went to the market and bought a tomato, chicory, fish, lychee, pineapple, grape, custard apple, indigenous arts and crafts, and an endive. You know, endive? You know? I went to the market and bought a tomato, chicory, fish, lychee, pineapple, grape, custard apple, indigenous arts and crafts, endive, and an airplane. What's wrong with you? What? Did I forget any? I forgot about custard apple? -No. -I said custard apple. There's no airplane in the market. But isn't the idea saying crazy things to make it harder to remember? Of course not. The idea is saying things you buy at the market. You don't buy an airplane, it makes no sense. It does if it is in the aviation market. Aviation market. Sure, and your aviation market has endivia, lychee, fish... -But that's your problem. -Arts and crafts. Then you are wrong. Because my market has airplanes. Sure, your market has everything. I'm going to the water. You're kidding me... Airplane. I DON'T HAVE THE SLIGHTEST IDEA OF WHAT I'M DOING WITH MY LIFE Where is everyone? I don't know. The bowling alley is not open today. So how did I get in? I don't know, I think the door was unlocked. So, what's your story? There are many ways to tell a story. Tell me some of them. How many do you want? One day, I skipped class, and came in here. Hi. My name is Guilherme, do you need anything? No. Thanks. You're welcome. But this wasn't the first time I skipped class. How nice. Skipping class in your first day in college. I felt sick. Sorry to get you out of your class. It's alright. It was so boring. I just got scared with your text, do you feel better? I'm just a little angry. What's the use of studying in a college inside of a shopping mall if all stores are closed at eight in the morning? I don't know. Do you want to walk around to window shop before next class? Alright. THE PSYCHIATRIST AND THE DENTIST Clarinha, honey, your mother and I have something to discuss with you. We wanted to tell you something. But first we want to, I don't know, hear your opinion. Before making a final decision, right, honey? Yes, honey, your father and I have talked, and we've decided to be together again. We've discussed it a lot, and we believe it is the best for everyone... -Right? -Right. We believe it. After all, we get along really well. Yes, we've always been great friends. Friends. Someone is failing because of absences. That's life. Did you know that with nine absences you fail automatically, regardless of your results in the tests? I think that's absurd. You take out the student's right to be a misunderstood genius. What do you do? I smoke, I drink, this kind of things. Hi, my name is Guilherme, can I play with you? Sure. Are you sure you don't want to use the barriers? So, what do you do for a living? Medicine. And you? Do you do anything besides trying to play bowling for free by going along with others? No, I'm hired to do this. Hired to do what? So, my dad, the owner of this place, realized one day that, in the morning, we get a different kind of customer, you know? People who come to play alone. The kind of customer that doesn't buy a lot, doesn't get sodas or snacks, and etc. So he hired me to keep company to these people and give some incentive to the customers to buy things at the bar. So you're like a stripper? How so? Have you been to a strip club? The strippers, basically, use their charisma and body skills to make the customers buy more champagne, more whisky, and they keep a cut of what the customer paid. Do they also get a cut? Damn, I'm a stripper. At first, it was easy to cut class. I tried reading a few books, which made me feel smarter. I was a blasé kind, reading things that really taught me, while others were satisfied with teachings that have been chewed by professors who were frustrated professionals. Such a boring discourse, being blasé is a lot of work. That's not for me. Then I had my smartphone phase. God bless the smartphone. I don't know what people used to do without them, having to go home to check your e-mail every day. I spent hours on Facebook, on Twitter, on MSN, GTalk... I even gave ICQ a second chance. But not many people are online in the morning. And, man, I think it is all kind of depressing. Look, Mark Zuckerberg, I'm sorry, with all due respect, but I hate Facebook. You ruined my life. I don't care about what those people are sharing with me. I'm not interested in what they're thinking or which YouTube video they think it's funnier. So, why do I keep spending, I don't know, 40 percent of my days refreshing the front page? I've tried sleeping as well, but the mall security guards always wake me up. Do you want to go to a party with me tonight? I'm going to the movies with my boyfriend. Is there some cool movie on? No. I think I'll tell him my mom asked me to have dinner. I don't know. Are you the lying kind? It's not that I am a compulsive liar, I just love lying. And I'm good at it, you know? And it is rare to have something I'm really talented at. But only small lies, that don't change anyone's lives. What's with this party? It is a party... BYOI. Bring your own iPod. I've just made this name up. But it is a party with no DJ, you bring your own iPod and choose what you want to hear. Alright. Why don't you drop out from Medicine school if you hate it? But I don't hate Medicine. You don't? I mean, I think I don't. Then, why do you skip class every day? I don't know. It's like this, before this current boyfriend, I was hooking up with a guy. We've actually been together for a month, which is the established time to make someone your official partner, so you can be boyfriend and girlfriend and be happy and so on. But I didn't want to date him, you know? But I also didn't want to break up with him, because I don't know how to do it, and it is a lot of work. So, since I didn't want do deal with the situation, and I didn't know how to deal with it, I've decided to stop answering the phone. And when he'd ask me out, I'd tell him I was too busy, and studying a lot. And I've decided to wait for life to solve it for me. You know? So he eventually stopped calling. Like this. So, why don't you try another major? I don't know what else I like. I don't even know if I like some other major. Imagine that, I keep changing majors until I'm 40 years old. You can have internships in different areas to find out what you like. And simply serve coffee and make copies to bosses in different areas to find out what I like. I know. I know. Find your way to find out what you like. You don't need to do things the way other people do. Because I think most people only do things the way they do because it is the way other people do it. Do you want me to become a stripper who's angry with the system like you? I'm not talking about this. You've just said it! I'm talking about finding out your own way to know what you like. For instance, what is a physician for you? What do you think they do? They... help people. Great. Then why don't you go around and help people? If you enjoy it, maybe you'll enjoy being a physician. But who can I help? Your family? I don't know. You know people with problems, don't you? So. Use your free time in the mornings to do that. It could be. Hi, honey. Hi. Are you going out? Do you have money? Do you need anything else? No. And you? Me neither. Are you sure everything is alright? Yes. Everything is alright, why are you suddenly worried? Because we haven't been talking much, so I don't know how's your work been, your life... We haven't been talking? What do we do every night during dinner? That's why I insist on having dinner with you. To talk. -Okay. -Alright? Everything is fine with my life, don't worry. Everything is fine at work, my life is great. It couldn't be better. Alright. Take care. If you get here late, call me. Behave. And if it isn't Medicine? Not that I'm giving up, but it would be nice to try out other fields as well. Just use the same thinking process. What is Law to you? Accusing or defending people. So you can go around getting into trivial arguments and defending one of the sides. I can't, I'm shy. Shit! Lawyers lie, right? Kind of a stereotypical view of the profession. But yes, why? Because you can see how far your lying potential can go. Good one. I can use family dinners for that. So, today it was so crazy in class. A rich girl, kind of slutty, lost her makeup bag in the middle of class and said no one could leave the room before it was found. And then she was saying her dad was this and that, that he would do I don't know what... By the way, her dad is a kind of famous dentist, Mario something, do you know him, Mom? No, I don't think so. Anyway, so an inspector came in with her makeup bag, that she forgot in the bathroom. And the worst thing is that it was during my favorite class. Methods and Approaches in Community Health 101. THE CARDIOLOGIST It is so bad when you have to go through a situation you swore you wouldn't go through anymore, you know? And it sucks when you think something like, "At least I didn't have a kid with her," when this goes through your head. I feel like a monster. What did you do? I don't know. I think nothing. But do you still like her? But I think that I also like my two other ex-wives. Do you have a favorite one? This is complicated, because the one I liked the most charges me more alimony. Bitch. Let's go out? I don't know, let's see people, see the sun. I'm tired, Clara. I think I'll use my divorce license to stay home. -Right. -Shouldn't you be in class? The professor is absent. Okay, alright. Now I need to try another profession. Because I'm trying Law at night with my parents. I wanted something in the morning. Preferably involving food. You can try all breakfast menus in all hotels in Rio de Janeiro. My aunt has a hotel network, you can start with one of her hotels. But what does that have to do? Journalism. Gastronomic criticism. My God, I'm having an orgasm just thinking of all croissants I'll eat. She's the bane of my life. My life is hell because of her. I can't get a girlfriend, then I have to listen to the worst things about her from my own mother. "She is a slut, she is no good, she dresses up like a mall saleswoman." "You don't want to marry a mall saleswoman." Fuck off! I'll get married to whoever I want, it's my life! I have my own job, what is this? I can't show up with a friend, then what do I listen to? "You want to walk around with that little thug?" What is this? Since I was a kid she says you can't trust friends, you can only trust the family. This family that leaves her by herself? If not for them, she'd be at a nursing home. That's what your father wanted. Then why don't you tell her? I can't say these things to the person I love the most. Yeah. I like grandma as well. She loves you too. -You're her favorite granddaughter. -I know. It is hard, you know? Being in love. You haven't met her. Gorgeous. Tania. She once told me, "Look, the day your mom dies, we'll be so happy." And then? I've started crying. In the middle of La Mole. We were at La Mole. I've covered my piamontese rice with tears. Uncle, have you ever broke up a relationship? With the mom I have, I had to become a specialist in sending girlfriends away. Perfect. Mom, we need to take a break. -What have I done, son? -Nothing. It isn't your fault, it is mine. -I love you so much, son. -And I love you, Mom. But don't think about this as goodbye, but as a "see you later." Sooner or later, you'll realize you're too perfect for me. Of course I'm too perfect, but you're not bad as well. -I'm not bad. -No. And if I'm perfect, shouldn't I choose who to be with? Mom, our relationship is worn out. We need a break, let's do this, let's give time to time. Son, I can't believe you're abandoning me. At least, your brothers didn't pretend to like me. Mom, I know it will be hard at first. But I wish I could count on your friendship. Mommy... Mommy doesn't love me anymore! I want my mommy! You can cry all you want. I'm your piamontese rice today. I'm so hungry right now! Do you want to go to the bowling alley after your breakfast? It could be. I miss my lonely bowling friends. But first I wanted to think about another job test. Do you sing? Or play any instrument? We can start a band. No, that's not for me. Then try learning some instrument. No, I don't have to. I can play the guitar. My mom put me in a class when I was a kid so I could play for her. But I hate it, I dropped out as soon as I grew up. Do you like movies? Then you can take your iPhone and record things around. What things? I don't know. Aren't you the artist candidate? I'm just a post-modern stripper. He would suffocate me, drain all my energies, left me feeling awful. And with all women he's had. Your uncle Ricardo is the worst non-alcoholic husband a woman could have. Then why did you marry him? I don't know, I believe for two reasons. Firstly, he's not that bad when you lay eyes on him, a cardiologist, with a nice family, well educated. A good man. Secondly, I got pregnant. What did he do, exactly, to suffocate you? He had some dumb dreams that never become true. He gets angry with the world. And he has nowhere to store this anger. Because he has a good character, wouldn't hurt a fly. So he dumps this hate, this anger, on people who live with him, sucking out all the joy this person could have. Do you think I can get, I don't know, an ideal woman for him? There was a time when I took this nice ex-wife role. Matched him with four friends. All of them deleted me from Facebook. "FILM PROJECT" DIRECTOR: CLARA STORY: TO BE DEFINED MADE WITH WINDOWS MOVIE MAKER, DON'T EXPECT MUCH RUN HERE "THE TREE OF LIFE" MOMENT What is this? A gift, from all my heart, to you, Uncle. And what is it? Just open up and see. Gift! "I'm a gift, I want to be opened." What is this? A videogame. I was thinking we could use it today, because I won't have class this morning, because the professor is absent again, so we could do this now. I have work to do, Clara. Are you insulting me like this, Uncle? Are you abandoning me, as if you're my ex-wife? 15-0. Luigi was a player... I wasn't with the racket yet. -Right. -Can we go back? No. No, no... I'm not good for this, Clara. This was a good one. Uncle, use the strap. What? So it doesn't fly to the TV. -Go. -You serve. I'll serve? Go get it! Okay. Go on, it's you. Right, go. Here. Die! Die, son of a bitch! Go on, Clara. Get down! Do you want alimony? Do you? Come get it, it's in my back pocket. Come on, come on! Die! Do you want full custody? Come here. Come here. Lose your head, bitch! Tell me, are you good at any sports? I used to swim when I was a kid, but... I know, I know, your mom made you, you were a genius swimmer, but grew up, and dropped out. -Am I right? -No. No, I was simply bad. I was a hazard to mankind when I was in a pool. I once almost cut out my friend's ear with the swimming during class. Our friendship was never the same again. Soccer? Volleyball? No? No. I have the motor coordination of a tube man. Isn't there any sports you're good at? Does Street Fighter count? I raise hell with Chun-Li. There's no Street Fighter in the Olympic Games. But there should be. You need to think of a sport, I don't know, a more extreme sport. No, no, no, no! Shut up, shut up, shut up! I think ice skating is so cute! Thank you so much for being with me. THE OPHTHALMOLOGIST My professor was absent. I was used to waking up in the morning. I figured you'd enjoy a birthday breakfast. I loved it. I was missing my favorite niece. Sure, I'm the only one. Even so. I think it is a shame that your father prefers to live isolated from the family. What I miss the most are the Secret Santa's for Christmas. Your dad's a fool. I think he envies you. Because you earn more than him, because your house is bigger than his, because Grandma likes you more. Then he's a bigger fool than I had imagined. Because he has the family I wish I had. He has lived much more than I did. Lecture me more on that, Uncle. What is this, are you becoming a psychiatrist, a psychologist like your dad? I don't know. And this type of conversation helps me decide. If it is okay to you to talk about it. Clarinha, the problem is insignificant, is foolish. So old it became a theme for a Titãs song, I wish I had worked less. I'm 40, haven't seen time pass me by, some things don't go back, anyway. The eternal dissatisfaction, that's life. You won't believe it. There was a bomb scare in college today. Was it just a scare? Yeah. I mean, I think so, at least. So far, nothing blew up. How are your grades? My average is 87. Not bad. You're not even trying? No, I'm just here for moral support. Thank you so much. Enjoy it. It is morning, it's empty in here. Go on with no fear. Jump, shout, flounce. Make my morning a show. Go. I had an idea for Architecture and Engineering. Say it. I want to build something. What? A tree house. I've never seen one in Brazil. Exactly! This is called "sense of opportunity." Haven't you ever wanted a tree house when you saw one in a movie? I can be starting a trend in Brazil. Like temaki or frozen yogurt. That's right, then go at it! I just have a problem. My house is not a house, it is an apartment. Can you lend me a tree? I think there must be one at home that will do. How do you know I live in a house? Because of your look of someone who lives in a house. And what does that mean? Nothing, let's have a snack. DOCUMENTARY PROJECT DIRECTOR: CLARA I wanted to know what you've done today. Nothing special. I want to know if you remember the day you looked at her and said, "She's the one I want to marry." Boy, it was as soon as I saw her. I knew she was the one. I used a nail polish they liked, they asked, "What is that color?" It is "voluptuousness," I'll devour all of you! I can't even catch a cold. But because you don't want to, or... I don't know, my friends say I'm too picky, I don't think I am. And one of them called me and said, "You show the boys that you are smart, that's why no one dates you." It crushed me, so I came to my Pilates. I really like to enjoy the beach. You like to enjoy the beach? -Right. -Got it. And do you go alone to the beach or with friends? Sometimes I go with my friends and sometimes I go alone. Man, at first, I wanted to study Marine Biology to be in the sea. I thought it was beach all the time. This guy made me a proposal, said that if I dated him, he'd give me toast, sneakers for me to jog every day and a broom for me to sweep his house. So I didn't want him, and ended up with this guy. I hated him. But this hate ended up becoming passion. At three years old, they say it is good to drop the pacifier and all that, and we've invented a story that all pacifiers went to the Moon. And there was the goodbye day for her pacifier, it was good. Do you have any funny stories about this trip? Funny story? Yes. I've met two Globo actors at the beach, that guy from "Cilada" and another actor, but it was really funny, they hit on us, it was all so funny. Nailed it! If your daughter watches this when she's 20, what do you want to tell her? Man... A pleasure. It is a pleasure being your dad. I wanted to say that respecting the elders is respecting our own future. Wonderful. Do you have a story, anything to share? No, no. I wish gyms were cheaper. Just that. Is there anything you want to say? So it is on the record forever in this movie? Something that maybe you want to say to the world, a war cry to the world? No. That's it! You're nailing it. Screw you! Clara, thank you so much for offering to be with Teo this week, because I need to go to this conference. Andre is working every morning, and we've had this issue with the babysitter... What issue? A foolish thing. The boy was playing chocking her with floss, she took it seriously and quit. No, but don't worry, I know it is just a joke. And, if he exaggerates, I'll spank him lightly, count to three... "Teo, one. Teo, two." I've always wanted to do this. Clara. We're against spanking children. No, but I won't really spank... We want to raise a human being, not a robot, programmed to obey whenever he's spanked. No, I'm sorry. It's that he's going through a tough phase, you know? He was invited to leave his school. Why, poor thing? A silly thing. He was playing, drowning his friend in the toilet, things he sees in movies. -They thought it was bullying. -Everything is bullying. The school coordinators took it seriously, this is just to impress the Globo Network. That's why I don't go to the parent-teacher meetings. I was bullied in school. There, you see? She's in one piece. Mature, beautiful, no problems in life, no traumas, there you are. Following the right path, you know what you want. So beautiful. That's me. It looks great! So, do you have any idea of how to do it? I sure do. I'm a semi-promising architect. Or a promising semi-architect. Or a promising architect. Semi. Do you want to see the project I've made? WOOD - HAMMER - NAILS ROOF - DOOR Here. I've made a list with all courses available in Brazil. -And what's next? -Philosophy. Great. And what will you do in Philosophy? I'll philosophize. About what? About things. What things? Things in life. That's fair. Totally fair. I noticed that I've never stopped just to think, you know? I don't know what's my opinion about things. For example, I don't know if I believe in God. Why? Because I never stopped and thought about it. I feel kind of bad with it. You know? I do. After all, who is Guilherme? I'm... I'm me. No. That is definitely not enough. Don't you think it is too late for you to want to know more about me? I hope not. I was waiting to see if I really cared about you before we dive deeper in our relationship. I'm afraid my head is like a flash drive, then one day I'll want to learn something really important that could save my life and I can't, because there's too much stuff I learned already. Anyway, I'm in a phase of sparing information. As much as that sounds dumb. Really? I don't think I'll ever get tired of useless info. Let's do something then. I'll tell you a really stupid thing about me, and you tell me a really useful thing about you. Okay? Go. I like to sleep wearing socks, take them out during the night and have fun looking for them in the morning. I'm studying Languages, I want to be a teacher. How cute! I always lose my pen's caps, and I really believe there is a magical kingdom inhabited by elves who steal caps. I... My dad owns the bowling alley and lets me do what I want. Provided that I obey him and say "yes" to some sporadic jobs he gets me. I've kissed a frog when I was nine, literally, because I thought it would turn into a prince. -And did it? -No. Alright, God. Okay. Let's go. I believe in God. I think that I believe in God. I believe in God once in a while. Especially, when I need Him. Actually, I think that, whether He exists or not, I think He is very useful. He helps us in difficult times, which is rare, because usually nothing helps us in difficult times, so... But I don't believe that, when we die, we turn into angels or go to heaven or something like that. I think we just die, and that's it. Stop thinking. Stop existing. But I would love to be wrong about it. If, when I die, God comes to me personally and say, "You got fucked! You were so wrong, I am real! Now let's have fun in heaven, your grandma Tina is missing you and she made a carrot cake!" Man, if He says that, I'll swallow my pride easily. So, I didn't go to class today. How so, did you skip class? No, of course not. We didn't have class, we had a lecture instead. A lecture about what? With Xuxa. She's making a hospital for children in need, it seems. She needed new volunteers to help. I thought it was so cute. I've always liked Xuxa. You can go bungee jumping. Or sky diving. I've always wanted that... Why would I do that? I don't know. I would add that my To Do List. If I had a To Do List. You know I'm not Jack Nicholson in that movie with Morgan Freeman, right? I'm not dying, I just want to know what to do with my life. Alright, alright, forget that I said it. I don't even have a list, I'm not writing anything. And what's the next profession? Geography. I'll visit all of Rio's tourist spots. Do you know I'm carioca, my entire family is, and I've never been to Christ the Redeemer? Nor the Sugar Loaf. It happens. I think I owe it to Rio. -Can you come with me? -Me? No. We'll dress as tourists. It will be fun! Please! Tourists? Going to Christ? Alright, alright, alright. THE NUTRITIONIST -It's good to see you like this, Uncle. -How so? Like this, healthy, eating a lot. I need to avail it. They'll put a catheter inside me, I'll need to eat through my belly, it is awful. I wanted to help you. How can I help you? What can I do for you? Hand me the jam? No, I'm serious. Me too, I hate dry bread. Yes... What's it like knowing you'll die? You also know you'll die, don't you? It is bad. But you'll die first. Not necessarily. You could go downstairs and be hit by a taxi. No, but the chances of you dying first are higher. No, there are much more people dying of traffic than of cancer. -Really? -No. But it could be, right? It's the kind of thing that is. The statistics. When does your treatment start? I won't do it. -Why not? -I don't want to. I thought this selfish kind only existed in movies, not letting the people who like them take care of them. Clara, your uncle is 27 years old. I have a cancer multiplying fast because I'm young. I have the right to be a bit irresponsible, and how did you say it? Inconsequential. -Selfish. -Selfish. Thank you. You're really not afraid? No. I'm not afraid. And fear is something that diminishes people, the last thing I want is to get smaller. Are you afraid of anything? A lot of things. Tell me one. Heights. Then do something for me. I'm resting a bit. That's fine by me. The property owners are pressuring for the construction to finish, they are a little mad, but... I've hit my finger with the hammer. It turned purple. Gui, that's... -I don't know about that. -What? I think you'll need to amputate that. Your loss, playboy. Can you help me getting it out? No, I'm scared of blood. Alright. I'll do the surgery by myself. But anyway, what are the next plans? I wanted to... To make the world a better place. But I don't know how to do that. Stand still. I'm standing still. Alright, then remain still. And the world is the way that it is. Independently from you. Now kill a panda. Or rip a tree out. Or, I don't know, invent a new reality show. You've made the world worst. Even being just one person among other seven billion. Being a small portion of humanity. Now do nice things, just like you're doing. You've made the world better, because you're not doing bad things, right? And you're not standing still. I think that's already something. I think. Well... No, no, no. You're crazy, I'm not jumping from here. You won't make your dying uncle's last wish come true? But you just want me to die so you can win the argument... No, Clara, you won't die by hang gliding, you'll die of something else. But what if the thing rips? What if I fall vertically, pierce the Earth and come out on the other side, in Japan? I'll have to live in Japan and I don't know anyone there. You're right, Clara. You don't have to make my wish just because it is the last one. Just because I'm dying... It is the only think I've asked you, Clara. You're the worst, Uncle. You're the worst. Okay. Run, run, run! You've always said breakfast is the most important meal of the day. I should've listened. Because we have so many options. There's cake, there's bread, there are eggs, there's quick bread, pancakes, waffles... I really should have listened. It is important to have set times to eat. It's good for you. Mom... Are you happy? I am, and you? You didn't like that I came back home, did you? No, I liked it. But did you? I did, honey. It is so good to have you close again. Your dad is such a good man, your dad is a great partner. But are you happy about it? Because I don't see you smiling a lot. Is this good enough? It is. Classic picture, open arms, that's it, like the statue, smiling. You're happy, Rio de Janeiro, marvelous city! Now devout. A devout that is emotional because her dream is to be here. I'm here! That's it. So emotional. With tears in your eyes. Mexican. Now hug Christ. Hug the statue. In the air. Like that. Now tickle the armpits. Now a high five with Christ. High five with Christ. Yeah. One, two, three, done. Now, "High School Musical." Go on. Wait, wait. Again, one, two, three... Done. Now one of us. Okay. I love pretending I'm a tourist with you. Did you know? Me too. We could make up a language. How so? Like, where are we from? I don't know, where do you want to be from? I want to be... I'm from Eastern Europe. My name is Irina. Actually... Okay. THE NEUROLOGIST So, Grandpa, I'm doing a school paper about the problems people have in life. It is for my undergraduate thesis. You're doing that in your first semester? I like challenges. Anyway, do you have any problems to share with me? Clarinha, I'm old. Old people like talking. Are you sure you want to listen to me? I have all the time in the world for you, Grandpa. You can spit it out. Clarinha, your grandfather can say he only made wrong choices in life. There was never a choice made by me that happened in the right time or moment. How so? I was in love with a girl and married another. None of them have forgiven me for that. I've always wanted the best for my kids, I've set boundaries, put them in the best schools, tried teaching everything that I knew, had a steady hand with them... And none of them have affection for me nowadays. And kids do everything to raise their kids in a completely different way of how they were raised. I hate what I do. When I was your age, I wanted to play soccer. But since I could study, I ended up studying. I preferred to snitch against my best friend in a hospital case because I valued ethics. I lost my best friend to find out, much later, that ethical people get nowhere in this world we live in. I retired telling everyone I wanted to enjoy my family. And I actually miss my patients, because I live alone in a huge house. People hardly ever visit me. I spend all my time alone. And I found out I've added too much sugar to my coffee. Grandpa, I think the only person with worse choices in life was Nicholas Cage. Who? An actor. Honey, I'm sorry, Clarinha. Telling you these things... I didn't know you'd be like this. I'm don't know how to help you. But you... just by giving me this attention, you've helped enough. Now, stop crying. It's that I'm afraid of making wrong choices in life. But you will make them. Many of them. And you can't be afraid. I'll tell you a story, I've met a guy, we've worked together for a long time. He made all the right decisions in life. All businesses he got into were successful. Got married to a gorgeous and loyal girl, who would die for him. His children as well. But let me tell you something about this guy. He was the most boring person I've ever met. Such a boring guy! So annoying. I'm sick of thinking with other people's heads. Or using someone else's thoughts because they were already made. You know what? I went on a diet last week, I ate a lot of kale, lettuce, tomato, but I'd rather live until I'm 60 eating junk food than living until I'm 80 eating what other people say it's right. At least, this will all be worth it at the end. I can do what I want. I can dance with no song playing. You know what? That's what I'll do. I'll dance with no song playing. Hi, everyone. Hi, Bial! Hi, Boninho! I'm making this video because I think I'd be a great acquisition for Big Brother Brazil. Why? Because of a flaw of mine. I know most people talk about their qualities, but I think I would stand out among all these videos if I talked about one of my flaws. "What is that flaw?", you must be wondering. I have no personality. That's a great flaw for your show. I can adapt to any kind of personality that is missing on the show's list. Do you need a controversial character? I could be controversial. Look, you don't talk to me, I'm not Doctor Dolittle to talk with bitches. I could be the kind that makes intrigue. So, Serginho has said he'll vote for you. He also said your mom is a bitch. I can be the weird hottie that ends up posing for nude magazines. But really, choose me. Because I was thinking, and I think I could possibly have no talent. But if Brazil loved me for two months, then I wouldn't feel so bad. So, do you feel like pausing your work? They challenged me to a chicken fight. I have no partner. We know you're the terror of pools. I don't have a bathing suit. No, I'll lend you some of my sister's. Let's go? Alright. Sorry. Where is Mom? She went to sleep at a friend's house. She thinks it's her fault you were skipping class. After you finish dinner you go to your room. You're grounded. No leaving house or receiving visitors. Especially your boyfriend, you hear me? He's not to blame, he didn't know anything. Right. Go to your room, and no TV as well. Hi. Sorry. So, I know I'm not in position to make demands, but I didn't want to do this over the computer. I know. I know, I know. I'll try to meet you tomorrow. I'll call you then. I mean, if you want me to. Alright. See you. Dad? What, honey, did anything happen? Many things. I wanted to talk to you. I want to say some stuff. I want to say that I miss when you took me out to the Botanical Garden. You did that until I was 13, right? Why did you stop it? Was that because I grew up? You didn't start working more. And I also wanted to say, what the fuck is that? You and mom getting back together? How so? How is that better for everyone? I don't even remember the two of you together. I was two when you broke up. What kind of reason is that? Are you feeling lonely, is that it? Are you afraid of becoming your dad? What a nice example of romance and hope you give your daughter. Congratulations. Thank you so much for admitting to me that you gave up completely on being happy and you're just together because that's better than nothing. I also wanted to say I miss our family. They were nice. They are nice. Why did you isolate us so much from everything? Why are you so stubborn, and...? Why are you so proud? You're not better than them, you're not better than anyone. People make wrong choices in life, and people... It's not their fault they make wrong choices in life, and people need help, and you don't help anyone. And you don't listen to anyone. And making me grounded without watching TV, Dad? I don't even watch TV anymore. I don't even have cable TV in my bedroom anymore, I turned it off to save more plugs. How long has it been since you entered my room? How long has it been since you asked me a question that you're actually interested in knowing the answer? How long has it been that you know nothing about me? Don't you like me? Is that it? You... Don't you... Because some people like me, and some people are interested in me, really. So... So why can't you be one of those people? You know, until one of these days, I was sure people were lying when they said they were in love with me. I thought, "That can't be true. So many good people in the world. Why me? That's wrong." And I feel a little stupid saying this, because it was everything my generation was raised to not say, but I miss affection. I'm sorry, honey. I don't have the slightest idea of what I'm doing with my life. Can I sleep here with you tonight? Sure, come here. Am I still grounded? Yes, ma'am. I've ordered to deactivate your bedroom's internet, your phone's internet as well. I figured it would be more painful than the TV. Thank you for the tip, young lady. Can I just use today to take care of some things? I wanted to clean my teeth with mom. I figured she'd enjoy it. Alright. You can go. Now, if you're lying about your true intentions, when you're back, I'll lock you in a dungeon with a bunch of alligators around it. Do you understand? That's fair. Did you bring what I asked you? I was worried. You disappeared. Did you bring it? I did. Did anything happen? It doesn't matter. Never mind. And will we keep meeting to find out what you want to do? No, I'll have to stop. And will you be with me or your boyfriend? I haven't decided yet. But look, the promise I made you at Christ is still standing, right? Check this. I'll choose a song on your iPod, you'll choose a song on mine, and when I say "go", we play it. -Choose one. -Right. Did you at least figure out what you want to do, any professions? No. But that's okay. I mean, I like skating. So that's what you'll do? No, I'm not good enough to be a professional. I just enjoy it. Here. Go!
