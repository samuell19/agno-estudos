VITORAZSKO, A POOR BORDER AREA, WAS ONCEPART OF THE BOHEMIAN KINGDOM. IT WAS THEN AUSTRIA FOR 600 YEARS AND IN 1920 IT BECAME CZECHOSLOVAKIA. LOCALS WHO WENT TO AUSTRIAN SCHOOLS BUT MAINLY SPOKE CZECH TO EACH OTHER TOOK IT HARD. SUBSIDIES FOR THEIR FIELDS WERE FEW. MANY LOST THEIR JOBS. FAMILIES WERE TORN APART. IN 1938, HITLER OCCUPIED AUSTRIA AND THEN SEVERAL VILLAGES HERE. IN THE VILLAGE OF SCHWARZWALD, WHICH WAS STILL PART OF CZECHOSLOVAKIA, RESIDENTS ONCE AGAIN ASKED, "WHO ARE WE AND WHERE DO WE BELONG?“ Karel, I baptize you first in the name of the Father, and then of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. God Almighty, Lord God who have made them worthy to receive the forgiveness of sins, through the laver of regeneration of the Holy Spirit, send on them your grace that they may serve you according to your will. For to You is glory in the holy church both now and to the ages of ages. Start playing! This is from us. The whole family bought it together. Thank you. Show us what you got! It's a proud nation! Stop, where are you going? Vasili Ivanovic. The Czechs left the farm. The Czechs? And where's your shotgun? I've got mine. So let's go. Quick! Cut it out, will you? Otto, can you stop it? Can you all be quiet? Could you all stop it, folks? If you don't screw me, too, I'll tell your husband. Those are ours. The Legionnaires! It's a bunch of Bolsheviks! What's this supposed to be? It's Chapayev. Famous Soviet film. What the hell is this? I'm not going to watch this! -Could you all please be quiet? -Don't be stupid. It's interesting! -This is communist propaganda! -Turn it off. No. -Turn it off at once! -Why should I turn it off? Because everyone's making fun of us! Stop it! This isn't a meeting! Stop it. What are you doing? To hell with you and your campaigning. This is how we hang all the Bolsheviks. All the Bolsheviks and gypsies! Yeah, and that's it. -It's just stinky Zwettler. -Stop it! Aren't I right though? Settle down, Arnošt. He's young. Give him some time. -Elen, I'm sorry. -We've ruined your baptism. We've always had it like this and this is the way it'll stay. [lullaby in German] Why so early? Why aren't you at work? -They didn't want to let us go to work. -Why not? Germans set up the border just behind the village. Past that is the Reich. People are signing petitions already for us to join Germany. We're Czechs, but we have a German heart. We don't give a shit about the Czechlands. -We want to go home. To Austria. -That's right! Don't get mixed up in this. For God's sake, people. Most of you last time registered as Czechs. So what's this all about? Jarda, we didn't know what it meant. Whoever agrees with moving the border, come and sign. Agreed. We'll take it to the Germans and we'll be there in a week. Karel, come and sign it. The Republic has also robbed you of subsidies. You can't do this! -To hell with you and your Reich! -Don't get involved in this! -They've stolen a piece of our republic. -Czechs just steal from us. -Go home! -Get lost, you Czech trash! Let me go, let me in there! -We're not throwing rocks at each other. -That's a bit much. This isn't the Reich! Rudy! If you do something to the linden tree, I'll whip you! -Give it here! -Leave it! Give it here! -Leave it! -Give me that! [German radio] God, what are you doing? Hide the radio! You're embarrassing me before everyone! -Give it here! Put it away! -Mr Stein… -That's the Führer! -Switch it off. I don't want to listen to that nutter! You bloody German cow! Mr Stein, is everything ok? I've got an offer for you if you wouldn't mind listening. I've saved up a little bit. I'd just… like to buy your shop. But I'm not selling. I think you're making a mistake, Mr Stein. You are a Jew. The Germans will be marching in soon and take it all from you. You understand? -I do. -Better something than nothing. Scram! Get out! Chutzpah! Chutzpah! -What did he want? -Don't worry about it. -What are you going to do with it? -I'm not giving it up here. -You may not need to get rid of it yet. -Be quiet. You got half the cottage and part of the field. Surely that's enough for you. Dad, please! That campaigning of yours! The Germans won't give a toss about that. Yes… What's going on? -What are you doing? -Sit. It's nothing! We'll pack it up again at Hanukkah! My dear. Whoa! We're here. Take it off. -It's too small. -Exactly. Hello. We are a delegation from Schwarzwald. An offer to join the Reich. At home in Reich. Your recommendation is enough. We will then take it to Berlin. We've always been Austria. The Czechs only steal from us. You can see yourselves how we're doing. Give them a piece of sausage and send them home. I should be ashamed to be a part of this family. -You do whatever Andula wants. -She's my sister. Karel. Let's leave this place. We'll sell the farm and leave. Maybe we can go to my parents in Dobříš. What would I do there? I was born here and I'll die here too. I'm scared. I sewed you some new pants. Show me. I thought you wanted new curtains sewn. This is more important now. It won't kill you. Andula is also helping out with everything. CZECH TRASH JEW Somebody painted gallows on our gate. This is crazy. Soon they'll set fire to our barn. So clean it off and decorate it to welcome the Germans like everyone else should. -For me, it's about order in the village. -I feel sorry for you. Have you not yet realized that German Law is now recognized here? Do you know that in Germany the Jews are being lynched on street lamps? Good luck to you, Polda. The swastika! It's backwards. CZECH TRASH -Get lost, you Czech trash! -Leave them alone. Look, he's provoking us. -Truth will prevail! -Don't get involved in this, idiot! Look, he's provoking us! Leave us alone. What type of Germans are you? None of you even know proper German! That's enough. Leave him alone! -Let's go home. -We can't just let them do this. -It's none of our business. -I think it is. -Bastards! -No… -Leave him alone! -You rat! It hurts! Are you all crazy? We're neighbors! We won't behave to each other like animals! Rat! You pig…! -Hello. -Shut up. -Heil Hitler! -Heil. -Hello. -Hello. -Fräulein Fuchs. -Yes. Get in. Welcome. WELCOME Heil Hitler…! Hello. We warmly welcome you. Franta. Franta. Don't even think about it. You're staying here. Hello. Please. Welcome. We appeal to the inhabitants to join the resistance. -By all available means. -"By all means“ is enough. Yeah. …means. Hide it somewhere for now. We'll make more copies at night and distribute it throughout the village. Let's have a look at the pub now. -You're crazy! -I don't give a shit about them. Josef… -I'm going with him. -Don't go. -A beer? -No. Have a schnitzel. Thanks, but I don't want one. Get lost! Stein. Chief firefighter. Arnošt, a beer? Yes, naturally. Thank you, Mrs Svitková. That's nice of you, but it's too cold for beer. Arnošt, please, go home. You'll do better if you go home. -Dad, what's wrong? -Everything's fine. Come and have a look! Come to the yard! Karel! Who did this? Who did this? We've always been Austrian. Our father, grandfather. It was always like this. You have to stick with the family. Write in German. I'm Czech. You don't know what this is about. You can be glad Karel takes care of you. Our land's changed countries three times, still slaving away for near nothing. Only Germans get land subsidies, so what am I supposed to do? -We'll get by somehow. -They can also take everything from you. -These are fucking awful times. -A final decision. I've got others to see. We three are German. I'm Czech. I'd rather choose to be German. There will be bigger allotments. Don't even think about visiting us. Go on and just write: two Czechs. -He fought in the legions, so we're Czech. -Shut up! Whatever. Czechs. Thank you. Thank you, my dear. So… Zdenka. Distribute this to people around the village. And here's the list. How much should I charge them? Nothing. Tell them it's a gift, and that I send my regards. Otto Klaus. -Rudolf Klaus. -Here. -Josef Metelka. -Here. -Jan Schwarz. -Here. -Alois Schwarz. -Here. -Otto Kaizinger. -Here. You're the most expensive thing I have. Remember that. But don't fear anything. And always be in the front. Commandants like that. Your father used to do that. -Rudy Svitek. -Yes. -Jindrich Winkelhofer. -Here. Whoever's afraid can't join the army! Only your socks will be coming back! -Scram. -I'm going. Get lost, you asshole! Hello, Elen! Thank you. From today, I'm guarding the trains. So I'm kind of a policeman. I told you. Thank God you got in. -We'll give this to Mareš. -No chance. I'm selling it. Wow! You look nice. Lojza! Are you coming to the pub? I'm busy! -Come! -Stop it! …and defeat Jewish bolshevism. Victoria is the symbol of wonderful German military forces which crush each and every opponent. Heil! I'm here again. Home sweet home. Give me a beer and a shot. You fool, you deserted! Not interested in rotting away in a ditch somewhere. So I rather told them I was actually Czech. They gave me a beating and kicked me out. You're an idiot. That depends. Haven't eaten all day. Home sweet home. I'll survive the war in here. Good evening. I'm looking for Arnošt. His son's on the front, so sometimes he sends something. We don't need anything. God knows who he stole it from. What corpse he robbed. -Josef. -Fine. Heroes. I'll probably just take it home with me. Yeah. Quality. Arnošt, there's been another complaint about your son-in-law. I won't say from whom. For now, I'll throw it in the trash, but the whole village knows what he does and they're watching me real close. He's gonna get us all hanged. What do you want for it? Yeah… Well, the seeding machine you have in the barn. Okay. You won't just let it be, and always want to be the hero. Do you want to get us all shot? You idiot! Dad, please… -Grandpa… -I beg your pardon. You married a Jew and your father's afraid. You think I'm not? Josef… He respects you for not divorcing me. But now you're responsible for us. Tell them you'll quit the resistance. Look, it's a horse. -Come on, Karel. -And I've got little goats, too. Yeah. -Okay. You'll finish it afterwards. -Yeah. You look nice. Come with us. You've been doing business with them your whole life. Come with us, Daddy. Oh, Bruncvík. Praise the Lord, we've trapped the wolf. -Get him. -Sir Kundrat of Germany! Not another step! Stab him! Whoever is victorious here, will rule the Bohemian lands! -You lost the right to rule long ago! -Behead the enemies of peace and law! Hit him! As long as we stand firm against our enemies, nothing can withstand our sword. Let me go, let me in there! I want to see it too, let me in! I heard you're raising money for families of those arrested. Who told you that? Don't worry. Nobody knows about it. Not even Karel. Daddy… -I'll come back. -I won't let you go. Elen… Zwettler! Here. Go on. The waitress sends you this. Come in. Thank you very much. Good. That's enough. The cow's too thin. No more calves from her. Haven't got enough for another. Stop by for some hay. Let's drink. Cheers. -From Rudy? -He marched through the Arc de Triomphe. -They get drunk on champagne there. -Let 'em drink. They'll fall faster that way. Come on. They say he killed 19 Poles. Sit down. -Alright. -Thank you. Go get potatoes. She's a shrew. She'd turn us all in. But before that she'd screw all of us. This one would. The entire Wehrmacht wouldn't be enough for her. Even with the general staff. -Come on. -Get going, cripple. Leave him alone when he wants to help. Here you go. You'll have to make do with this. I really don't have more. Without you we'd all die of hunger. Go clean up! What are you doing here? Get out! Let go! We've got the least members in the district. They want us to increase it. -How could you do that? You animal! -Be glad I didn't kill him on the spot. -People, my God. He's a good boy. -They called from Gmünt. He's in Linz in prison and will be charged for stealing and rape. They usually send them to Mauthausen for a year or two. What if they shoot him? We haven't got anyone else. We should've joined the Germans. And what if I joined your party? That'd help him, wouldn't it? I can report on everything happening in the village. That's out of the question. This is a German party. You should've raised the boy better. Nothing will save him anymore. Yeah. I'll write a confirmation that he helped the municipality and Reich. It could help. Whoa! My dear… Come on. I'll be praying for you. Please look after her. Don't worry. I'll take care of her. Ride! Just try and come back soon. Mommy! Mommy! Fuck the thousand-year Reich! Fuck Germany! Fuck Hitler! Go ahead and kill me! Motherfuckers! Rudy is dead. Rudy. Leave me alone! My boy! -Come again. -Let's go. Careful, don't damage anything. They were quite well-off. Why are you sitting here? Go and help. -Take the pictures. -Look, puppets. -Go on! -Very nice. If the Reich isn't interested in the remaining property, I'm willing to buy it at a discounted price. It'd be a shame to let it fall into ruins here. The mixed-blood will stay here for now. She'll report to the town hall each month. From your father. Could you send this, please? To my parents. Rest assured. Go! Push! Kick it and push! Go! Go! This belongs to the Reich now, too. Now I owe 50 crowns for rent. They want me to move out. Get lost. This is for the rent. Now leave her alone. Come! -You know it was an official order. -You're an official. Get out! Aren't you ashamed? What are you going to tell them after the war? Nothing. They're dead already. I didn't have the heart to tell her. It's horrible. We were friends our whole lives. I feel bad for the girl, but she can't take care of the property by herself. Over here with that. Come on! There. Idiot. Daddy! Daddy! Welcome. Terezín? There, too. You're a hero, boy. If you need anything, just say it. Do you want to eat with us? Food's ready. First, I have to go to the town hall. You can't hide in here like a rat. Go out in public. Josef! I'm sorry about what happened to Elen. Thank you for Zdenka. Come. Have a seat. They named me District Security Secretary. I'm supposed to help with the National Committee. Polda and I already agreed. I'll be taking over for now. A government order came to clean out the biggest Nazis. Yeah. Well, I know. But we won't need your help with it. He's a bastard, but he wasn't unharmed by the war. His son lost his leg somewhere in the East. -I bet he won't show his face for a week. -Get out, too. This doesn't concern you. Get some water. And some potash. He works as a messenger for us. We need him. I can smell myself. You think I don't know who smeared the shit on me that time? I know everything that went on here. I'll be useful for you. Go away from here! Scram! I was lucky to have survived. Many others weren't so lucky. Now it's time to put things back in order. I'll read you what the vice-chairman of the Government, Gottwald, said. "Dispose of all active Nazis and secure their property for the good of the nation. Arrest at once all who betrayed the nation and actively cooperated with the Germans. Put them up in front of people's courts that will be set up as soon as possible. Secure the property of the Germans, traitors and collaborators. In the countryside, confiscate their land.“ I think he said it nicely, Mr Gottwald. They deserve nothing less. And I think that revenge never helped anyone. Let's go. If you did nothing, you have nothing to fear. Of course. We all know each other here. We're going home. Come on! Good evening, Mr Reich Commissar. Would you be so kind so as to return our things to us? Everything was passed to the Reich. Nothing can be done. I understand. My wife and her parents were also passed to the Reich? And you just helped with that a bit? That's nonsense. You should've been more careful. You got them there yourself. The wardrobes are ours. And the clock, too. You get nothing. It all was Arnošt's. You just sponged off him. You should thank me that you at least have a daughter. Be glad that you're home and get out. It'll all be back by tomorrow evening. The court will resolve the rest. First they'll take everything we have and then drive us out from here. President Beneš, he speaks about it nonstop. "Liquidate…“ "All Germans gone…“ "Let out all your hate…“ -What, are you German or what? -Didn't you hear Pachl? He was talking about us in the pub. Pachl's happy to be standing on his two feet. -Do you know what he went through? -Exactly. And now someone will pay for it. You were right. We should've left back then. What are you afraid of? You didn't do anything to anybody. Let's go dance. Karel… The war's over. We have to celebrate. Josef, I'll take you home. Come. Don't worry. Everything'll be alright. You're right. Everything'll be alright. Dad, come home. You're sick. Alright. In a little bit. Zdenka! Come on, girls. Do you have the mayor there? Look at you. All grown-up. He provided for you for 20 years. -He also worked me to the bone. -But he sold hay and potatoes to everyone. He was in the NSDAP. Can't change that. There hasn't been a clear order, but the district called saying Minister Svoboda orders not to waste time. Then I'd take his house. Don't overdo it again. We aren't stealing homes, but making a list of traitors. Will all the names fit on your paper? Complete justice would mean just us here. Well, if that's the case, then I'd take the pub. -What about the waitress? -She can stay here. No problem. She can't. And neither can you. They kicked you out of the Wehrmacht only by chance. You're all vermin and a bunch of rats. You were shielded here during the war. -Josef. -And now, you want to rob them all. But I remember it well. Based on how you act from now on, you possibly get a house and your grave sins will be forgiven. What are these acts of theft? Bedřich, don't get involved in this. Come! Go home! Don't get mixed up in that. Come! Come! Karel, come here! You're under arrest in the name of the Republic! Move it! Go on! -Where are you taking him? -What's it to you, bitch? Franta, what are you doing? Germans, tremble! Franta has returned! I'll kick your ass now! Come here! Stand over here! Welcome home, boy! -Can you explain to me what you're doing? -It's a strict government order, Marie. For now, they'll be under the town hall, then who knows. Probably to Třeboň, to court. I know that you haven't got any connection to this, but there's no other way. -Go home, Veberová! -They didn't put you in that camp! -Leave her alone, you bastards! -Get back here! Marie, go home. Go and hide. Karel, come to me. What are you doing here, you pieces of shit? You can't do this! -The Germans fucked us over, too. -Come on, grandpa. Leave him alone! Let him go, Otto! -Hands up! -Come along with us. -Take them to the cellar. -Let's go. -You heard him. Get going! -Karel! -Move it! -Go! What are they going to do with us? Nothing. It's just crazy. We'll be let go. -Pachl is a fanatic. -He's an idiot. Go home! -Go home, Franta. -I've got some work to do. Let's go! Not that. -I'm not leaving it here. -It stays there. What's going on? You're going with us, you bitch. Where's your man? Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Leave me alone, you hear me? Leave me alone, you hear me? Leave her alone! What are you doing? Let her go! Dad! Dad! You disgusting old man! Shut your mouth. Take him outside. Leave me alone! -Where are you taking me? -Dad! Leave him alone. Leave me alone! You like uniforms, don't you? Come on, she'll be good. Tell me where you fucked the Nazis. We'll enjoy ourselves a bit. You're going to like this. Come here. Come here. It'll be alright. All of you will admit to everything you did during the war. You're confusing us with someone else. We are good people, not criminals. You weren't even here during the war. That's for the court to decide. You especially should keep your mouth shut! Come here! Polda. Send her home. She needs a doctor. Give her another one in a few hours. I'll send you water. What do you want to do with us? Get out, fellas. -Cavalry Colonel Kreps. -Mareš, the mayor. Welcome. With government authorization, we are here to execute necessary security measures. And how do you want to do that? -We're just getting rid of your Germans. -You want to expel all Germans? Like everywhere else. We're cleansing the Republic. Haven't you heard? I didn't think it applied to us. We're a bit detached here. -Plus someone clipped our telephone wires. -Have you got any refreshments? We've been driving nonstop for three days. The men are dying of fatigue. I don't like this. We'll wait until they fix the phone, then we'll call. We haven't got enough time for that. We have to move on. Guys, let's do it. Come along with me. -All Germans outside! -Pack up your trash and get out! -I don't understand. -Should I tell it to you in German? Get out I said! You're going to Austria! 50 kg and be in the square in half an hour. Go, pack your things! Quick, start packing! Schnell! You understand, you German trash! Don't get in my way. You're going to Austria, is that clear? Leave the keys in the lock. Mommy! Come on! Come on! Come on! They're driving people out. It's horrible. You have to stop it at once. You understand, you German trash! -You're not going to do anything? -They were asking for it. Lock the door and open it for nobody. You wanted to be "at home in Reich“. Now you've got it. Come on, move it! Marie! -Leave her alone. It doesn't concern you. -Marie! Marie! Let her go. Zdenka, come with me. Come on! What are you looking at, move it! They haven't done anything to anyone! Let them stay! At least the kids. If you don't like it, you can go, too! -Go! -What're you looking at? Move it! Keep moving! Go! Lojza, what's going on out there? -They're driving people out. -To where? To Austria. And now shut your mouth! Bednářová, go home. Go home. Get up and go. Hurry up. Go, go. -Have you all gone mad? -What are you doing, bastard? Put it back! It's not yours and no use to them now. -Franta! Put it back! -Don't touch it! Leave it! -Franta! -Don't touch it! Return it at once! Franta! What's up, you bastard? Move it! Faster, you trash! Come on! -Show me. What have you got there? -What are you doing? Give it back to her! Get up, you scum! You piece of shit! The villages around are all full! All the Austrian villages around are full. They won't take you in. No use going there. And now everyone! Sing! Erika! -Sing! -Sing! How about you? Come on, come. Sing. How about you, Karel? I don't hear anything. Fuck off, Otto. Otto! Sing! During the war you didn't utter a Czech word and now you can't speak German? What? Louder! -Sing! -Louder! You really thought you could fuck with us? Sing! Sing! You sing, too. Sing! Otto, stop this shit! Satisfied? The whole village is upside down. I never imagined it like this. And how did you imagine it? Set up a people's court. Kill the Nazis you have in that cellar so we can move on. But we're not judges. You survived a concentration camp, I hear. Yes. So what's the problem? You called us here for all of this. -But you all are soldiers. -We won't just take revenge like this. What the fuck are you thinking? That you'd hide behind me? I am a cavalry officer of the Czechoslovak army. Do you know what that means? Find someone amongst my bastards who will help you. And whoever defends the Nazis will end up like them. That includes even you. And now get out! Go! What are you going to do? Jarda. Dad, you can't do this. -Go home. You can't understand this. -I'm not going until you stop it. Please. Zdenka is right. We can't do this. Germans killed your mother, grandma and grandpa. For four years they left me to die in prison. I saw innocent people tortured and killed. Every time they took them to be executed, they begged me to take revenge one day. You fucking bastards! What have you done? -What have you done, you bastard? -Leave me alone! Are you surprised now? Bring in a few people. There's not enough of us. Mommy, when's Daddy coming? I want to go home. This is your home now, Mrs Veberová. -Shoot! -Old man. -We're going to the town hall. -Why do you need me? -Be glad and don't worry. We need people. -Leave him alone. He's not well. -You stupid old man, come on! -Leave him! Move it! Hurry! Hurry up! Nobody admitted to anything. Nobody did anything. Therefore, the judges are in agreement. In that case, rise and hear your verdict. This people's court is being heard at the behest of Colonel Kreps, commander of the Partisan Regiment, authorized to cleanse the region from German-Nazi elements. They were convicted by Czech citizens of these crimes: Several offenders defected in 1938 across the border to the German army to work intensively against the Czechoslovak Republic. They were very dangerous, acted defiantly and continued to threaten Czech citizens. There were organized Nazis and several of them were active in militias like Volkssturm. NSDAP meetings were held in Anna Svitková's pub. Marta Lišková turned Elen Pachlová in to the Gestapo for acts against the Reich. She later died in a concentration camp. On the grounds of these findings, the people's court finds these offenders guilty and sentences them to death. But it's not true. I'm not signing anything. This is plain murder. We aren't going to just shoot them for doing "heil“. They're our neighbors. -Criminals. -Daddy… Daddy, come home. Send them to the district. Let them deal with them. That's right. We won't be like those Germans. Fuck you all with this. -Out of the way. -You're not going anywhere. That's enough! I guess you didn't notice this is a revolutionary court and not a neighborhood mingling. We are trying crimes of history's most horrific war and not just a few stolen chickens. Whoever doesn't sign, endorses these war criminals. He endorses scorched cities and tortured children. So he himself is a war criminal. And as one, he'll go, too. Move it, old man. Good, that's enough. Give it here. -Franta, please don't do this. -Fuck off! For God's sake, don't do it. Franta! Heil Hitler! Heil Christ! Calm down, Annie. Calm down. Look, Anna. Look… Look what your brother is building. Wait here. What are you doing here? We're moving away. I can't bear looking at that pit anymore. I've come to apologize. I… I don't know what to say. I don't want anything from you. I'm very happy I can deliver not only God's love but also the message of a homecoming. You have a lot of supporters among those in your region and in the whole country. Even the leaders of the superpowers have spoken out in order for your government to finally understand and start discussing things. Pass me the tarp. Mail! Mail! Müller! Sign here. Vebers! Here you go. One signature, please. Schneider! Here you go. They've just brought this from the village. Take it! An official call to return. Do we have to go home? I'm scared. Go away! What do you want here? Go away! If you're looking for housing, go to the municipality. They'll find something for you. I said go! Go! Go home, go home. Trash. The government has pardoned you even though the people will probably never forget. I'll get you a permit that you can return home. Not everyone is so lucky. Go to the town hall for some furniture. The municipality will lend you a piece of your old field so you don't starve. We'll write up a request for a National Certificate of Reliability. If it works, we'll see what happens next. For now, there are no food tickets. Come on. Nice pieces. Like new. They're ours. I'll take this. Was it all worth it? Once you have money, you can pay me for the furniture. Zdenka! Will you help me? And sew white bands onto your sleeves. So I don't have any problems in the district. I didn't think you were coming back. I wanted to have a memory of you. Forgive me if you can. They're coming for me! They're all coming for me! Marie… I heard you all lived there like animals. What's his name? Lojza, like his father. I don't have anything to offer you. -What's that? -A request for us to bury our dead. Will you sign it? I don't know. -I'm sorry. I can't. -They're there covered up like animals. Please, don't provoke them. They won't forget. It's horrible here right now. People are afraid of the other. I'm afraid of them. Never mind. We have come to request, in the name of the bereaved, to bury our dead. A request for exhumation and funeral. We will of course pay for it ourselves. Wouldn't you like a state funeral as well? Where is the grave of my wife? And the millions of Soviet soldiers? Light a candle at home. As long as these black widows and their bitches are waltzing about, -there will never be peace and quiet. -They're coming after us. I dream about them every night. You're an officer for State Purification, so do something about it. If we win the next election, it won't be a problem. You can be sure, Comrade Inspector, that I will file a complaint on you. You have the right to that. Just please leave out the "Comrade“ part. The people's court you led was unequivocally illegal. For the death penalty, you failed to put together basic evidence. It was a few days after the war. There wasn't time for any investigation. Everyone knew the Germans had terrorized the village. -And the colonel decided the court. -Did you have any real evidence? Like that Lišková reported my wife. Surely you know how that ended up. Of course, I'm sorry for that. But I'm asking about evidence. Maybe you don't know that access to the Gestapo archive has now been opened. Not a single wartime report came from your village. -So who put her in the concentration camp? -Apparently you did. You were careless during the resistance. As a Jew, she wouldn't have probably escaped. She may have survived, but nobody knows. You probably don't know that I am soon to become the district secretary of the Communist party. -I will be making a complaint about you. -Forget about the party. Last thing we need now are scandals. You might keep your membership. Nothing more. We also found in the archive that you were an informant in prison. And you even attempted suicide there. What do you want of me? Take it easy. Stop poking your nose around. No function. Just an ordinary and discreet life. Those two came to me. I'm afraid they're going to arrest me. But I did just what you wanted. -You work at the prison though. -They fired me. -Are you in the Communist party? -No. So get in there quick. You could be secret police, too. They're looking for people. So arrange it, or I'll tell them everything. What's going on? I'm leaving. Where? Wait! Zdenka! Zdenka! Are you Marie Veberová? The state's decided to move you to the interior. Just like the other German families. You have three hours to pack. Leave the animals. The co-op will be taking them. -And what about the harvest? -It's not your concern anymore. Aren't you afraid that one of them will return and wring your neck?
