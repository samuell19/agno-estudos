Will you marry me? [chirping continues] Yes? Yippee! We'll get Papa Smurf to marry us right away. Why, I'd be delighted to preside at your wedding, Woody. Thank you, Papa Smurf. (Smurfette) 'You want me to be your maid of honor?' Oh, I'd be honored. It'll be the smurfiest wedding of the year. No, no, of the decade. No, no, of the century. I hate weddings! But Laconia and I want a simple wedding. Oh, Woody, you and Laconia deserve the best. Yes, and everyone knows the key to a happy marriage is an overwhelming, mind-boggling wedding. gulp (Smurfette) 'Now, don't you worry.' [chuckles] Just leave everything to me. [instrumental music] Tailor, sew the gowns and suits. 'Greedy, bake the biggest cake you ever baked.' 'Vanity, make sure Greedy doesn't eat the cake.' Oh, this is so exciting. I almost feel like I'm getting married. scribble scribble Smurfette, the wedding invitations are ready. Oh, good work, Brainy. thud Oh, gosh, Smurfette, uh, what can I do? Well, Clumsy, you can deliver the invitations. Oh, got it, goody. Smurf away, Handy. He-he-he. Smurfing away. [rope creaking] snap Now, everyone we know will be invited to the wedding of the century at noon tomorrow, in Bluebell Dell. [frogs croaking] [bird screeching] [gasps] Yoo-hoo! Pussywillow Pixies. Yoo-hoo! Pussywillow Pixies. Yoo-hoo! Pussywillow Pixies! - Shh. Listen. - 'Yoo-hoo! Pussywillow Pixies.' Why, that sounds like Clumsy Smurf. (Clumsy) 'Whoa!' Yes, I believe it is. Hah, hiya, pixies. G-g-gosh, brr, water sure is wet. splash What're you doing here, Clumsy? Uh, Laconia's getting married. [all exclaiming] Oh, I just love weddings. They're such a good excuse to get dressed up. Smurfette's inviting everybody. Uh, but they won't know they're invited unless I get these delivered. We can help you there, Clumsy. Pixies! Gosh! [chuckles] Airmail. 'Wow, there's going to be a wedding.' ♪ Going to be a wedding ♪ ♪ Going to be a wedding ♪ ♪ Going to be a wedding ♪ plop Bah! I'm no better at catching fish than you are at catching Smurfs. [meows] Oh, I'd give anything for a tasty little Smurf pan-fried over an open fire. [meows] Oh, Azrael, I've got something. 'Hmm, what have we here?' It's a letter of some sort addressed to mother nature. Well, well, well. It seems those disgusting Smurfs are giving a wedding. meow meow In Bluebell Dell at noon tomorrow. At last, I'll have them all in the same place, at the same time. meow Oh, it'll be a wonderful wedding, Azrael. Because I'll be the one to live happily ever after. [evil laugh] splash [mumbling] Oh, Laconia, I'm so glad we finally have some time alone. (Smurfette) Yoo-hoo, Laconia! Uh, could you come my house? I, I have something smurfy to show you. Well, I wanted some time alone. [sighs] Now I've got it. - Surprise! - Surprise! It's a wedding shower, honey-lamb. In your honor, my dear. Laconia says thank you. She really is surprised. - Ooh! - Ooh! (Smurfette) 'Laconia says it's beautiful.' [giggling] I wonder if I'll get married someday. I'm sure you will, dear. When you're as mature as I am. [giggling] Laconia says it's very important to find the right wood-elf. Or the right pixie. I wonder if I'll ever meet the right Smurf. And if I do, how will I know he's Mr. Right? [humming] Oh, Greedy. This cake isn't nearly big enough for the wedding of the century. It was a lot bigger, Smurfette but I accidentally ate a few layers. I'm sorry, Smurfette. I took one glance at my incredible good looks and, whamo, it was all over. Don't worry, Smurfette. I'll bake you another wedding cake faster than you can say, "I do." [humming] [laughs] Greedy is just as sweet as his sweets. Hmm.. I wonder.. Oh, Greedy! Oh, Smurfette! [instrumental music] At last, at last! At last! At last! - Lunch! - Huh? chomp chomp chomp Say, honey, did you save any of that rice they threw at the wedding? It sure would taste smurfy in a stew. Greedy Smurf, this is our honeymoon. Oh, don't get mad, Smurfette. It's bad for your digestion. [gulping] At least stop eating long enough to give your new bride a kiss. Why, certainly, Smurfette. crunch Kiss me, my little dumpling. Oh, yuck. I'm afraid life with Greedy would be too fattening. Oh, Smurfette, you're doing an absolutely smurfy job on this wedding. It's going to be as beautiful as a certain Smurf I know. Oh, thank you, Vanity. Hmm, I wonder.. [instrumental music] (Vanity) 'Oh, you're the most breathtaking creature' 'I've ever seen.' 'I simply can't take my eyes off you.' Oh, Vanity, I'm not that smurfy. Who's talking about you? I'm talking about me. Oh, dear, I don't think I can marry Vanity either. [sighs] He's in love with somebody else. [instrumental music] (Gargamel) 'Oh, Azrael' 'what wedding would be complete without music, eh?' - Music? - Magical music, Azrael. Music that will make the Smurfs dance to their doom. [evil laughter] 'Now where's my mallet? Aah!' thud My magical music machine must be finished by midnight tonight. [mumbling] 'That's when I cast my spell' and put the ghouls in my magical Ghoulliope. [evil laughter] thud Yeow! Hup two, hup two, hup two.. Oh, Hefty, could you hide the wedding cake where Greedy won't find it? Uh, sure thing, Smurfette. I'd do anything for you. Hup two, hup two, hup two.. Oh, Hefty is so big and strong. Hmm, I wonder.. [instrumental music] Oh, Hefty, you're so romantic. Are you running all the way home to be alone with me? Nope, I'm running home 'cause it's good exercise. thud This is your new home, honey. 'How do you like it?' Well, actually, Hefty, it's not very, uh, warm. Oh, don't worry, my little tricep. Once you work up a good sweat you'll be as warm as an old sweat sock. [chuckles] The more we exercise, the longer we live. And the longer we live, the more we can exercise. Yippee! Here, my little hockey puck, lift this one. [grunts] (both) Hup two, hup two, hup two.. Hup two, hup two. Here, my little medicine ball, catch! (Smurfette) 'No, Hefty, no!' 'Aah!' [groaning] I don't think I have the strength to marry Hefty. [instrumental music] [owl hooting] [Smurfette yawning] 'Oh, my, I better get to sleep.' I've such a big day tomorrow. I wish I could decide which Smurf would be right for me. He'd have to be down to earth like, like Farmer. [rooster crowing] Rise and shine, my little potato bud. Time to dig in the dirt. [crowing] Oh, but Farmer.. [yawns] Can't I sleep in just once? Sorry, my little pumpkin seed. You're a farmer's wife now. [crowing] Oh, dear, maybe down to earth isn't quite right. Practical is more like it. [yawns] Like Handy. knock knock knock knock Sorry to wake you, my little sawhorse. knock knock knock Handy, what are you doing? Fixing leaks in the roof. But there aren't any leaks in the roof. No sense waiting till there are, dear. Oh, dear, Handy isn't Mr. Right either. Maybe I need husband who is lots of fun. Like Jokey! Oh, it's so much fun to come home to Jokey after a hard day's smurf. Argh! Aah! [laughs] Surprise! Very funny, Jokey. You think that's funny, what about this? splash [laughing] And this? [laughing] Marriage to Jokey would be no laughing matter. [yawns] Oh, well.. ...maybe I'll meet Mr. Right at the wedding. [intense music] (Gargamel) 'Behold!' The instrument of Smurf destruction. [evil laughter] Is it magnificent, Azrael? Now, a little rehearsal. Meow? Oh, musical spirits from out of the past. [organ music] 'Come forth with magic as this spell is cast.' Give me the power of your magic tune. [music continues] That makes all who hear it dance to their doom! [music continues] [evil laughter] 'It's working!' 'My magical Ghoulliope is working!' [laughter continues] Mummy said those music lessons would come in handy someday. [evil laughter] 'And now, Azrael, under cover of darkness' I'll take my magical music machine to Bluebell Dell. [cackling] And those stupid Smurfs won't even know I'm there. By the time the wedding guest arrive.. ...I'll be ready. crank [rumbling] Eeh! Get off! Get off, you stupid cat! [Azrael meowing] (Gargamel) 'I can't see where I'm going!' 'No! Stop.' 'Get off, I say, you fool. I can't see.' [instrumental music] [screaming continues] crash [instrumental music] Oh, Tailor, that suit isn't nearly fancy enough for the wedding of the century. You've gotta have frills and bows and fancy buttons. Alright, alright, Smurfette, I'll see what I can do. (Smurfette) 'Handy!' 'Is the smurfamatic rice thrower ready?' Ready for action, Smurfette. [instrumental music] whack Mighty early for hail. Now let's see, "Red carpet," check "Hot air balloons," check. Gee, Smurfette. You are working pretty hard. [yawns] If you'd like to take a nap before the wedding you can borrow my.. snore ...uh, pillow. [humming "The Wedding March"] Ooh, these flowers will make a smurfy bouquet for Laconia. Oh, she's so lucky she found her Mr. Right. Uh, one, uh, two, uh two, uh, one, uh.. Aah! thud Clumsy, what are you doing? Oh, uh, teaching myself to dance. [laughing] - In a bush? - Yeah. Well, I didn't want any Smurf to see me. How am I gonna dance at the wedding if I don't know how? Oh, Clumsy, I'd be happy to teach you. You would? Gosh! Just follow me. Smurf two, three and smurf two, three and.. [sighs] I'm almost afraid to wonder. [instrumental music] 'Introducing the dynamic dancing duo' 'Mr. and Mrs. Clumsy Smurf.' [instrumental music] - Ouch! - Oops. - Sorry, Smurfette. - Oh, Clumsy. Love means never having to say you're sorry you stepped on my foot. Ouch! Ouch! Oh, gosh, Smurfette I guess you found out why they call me Clumsy. Don't worry, darling, ouch! You're my husband now. Ouch! And I'd follow you to the ends of the Ea-arth! [screaming] (Clumsy) Gosh! I've never fallen this far before. [laughing] Oh, dear, I love Clumsy but I just don't think I could stumble through life with him. Hm, not bad. Not bad at all. Hi, Papa Smurf. Smurfette, why the long, blue face? Oh, Papa Smurf I'm afraid I'll never find the right Smurf. - For what? - To marry. Oh.. Every Smurf has something wrong with them. [chuckles] I know. But, Papa Smurf, how can my Mr. Right have something wrong? Well, Smurfette, no smurf is perfect. You'll know you've met Mr. Right when the smurfy things about him make the unsmurfy things seem smurfy. Oh. Oh, I understand, Papa Smurf. I feel much smurfier now. - Good. - Well.. I'd better get dressed for the wedding. Bye. Hmm, I wonder.. Nah! [instrumental music] (Clumsy) 'Gosh, what's it say, Farmer?' Uh, it says here "Mother Nature had to see to the world migration. 'So, she sends this magical music machine' 'with her regrets.' Oh, naturally, when she heard we were having the wedding of the century, she outdid herself. (Brainy) 'I believe it's time I had a talk with Woody.' I'm sure he use some encouragement from his ahem, best Smurf. So, how are you feeling, Woody? Oh, I feel fine. Really? I expected you to be extremely nervous. After all, this is the biggest day of your life. So many things can go wrong. Maybe you're not ready for marriage. Maybe she's not ready. 'Maybe she has some nasty little habits you don't know about.' Maybe you have some nasty little habits she doesn't know about. 'Maybe you'll be miserable for the rest of your life.' Why, I wouldn't blame you if you just passed out. Hmm. There's something strange here. - I wonder why-- - Papa Smurf, Papa Smurf! The groom just fainted. Great smurfs! I guess he just couldn't take the pressure, Papa Smurf. Feeling better, Woody? Uh, no, Papa Smurf. - I'm really scared. - Scared? About all the things that could go wrong. Well, there are things that might go wrong. But Laconia's willing to take the chance. [clears throat] 'Exactlywhydid you ask her to marry you?' Well, 'cause she's kind and easy to talk to and.. - Well, she's my best friend. - I see. (Woody) 'She's got a great sense of humor.' And a terrific tailor. And we always have a wonderful time together. Gosh, Papa Smurf, I just plain love her. Hey, what're we waiting for? Let's go. Look on this. What a clever Papa Smurf. Ahem, I haven't the slightest idea what you mean, Tailor. [laughing] [people chattering] (Smurfette) 'Oh, everything is perfect.' 'Just the way I planned.' ["The Wedding March" playing] (Gargamel) 'And now, the final step in my dance of doom!' [rumbling] [instrumental music] [gasps] Great smurfs. [howling] [evil laughter] [laughter continues] whirr clack clack clack [music continues] Wha-wha-what happened? Oh, that music machine is playing magical music! Oh, dear, oh, dear, we've gotta stop it. (Gargamel) 'Dance, you rotten little smurfs.' 'Dance the dance of doom.' [evil laughter] splat splat splat splat splat [stammering] What's going on? Azrael, stop them. [mumbling] 'You...you're ruing my fun!' Run! 'Run!' splat [instrumental music] splat Huh? Run, my friends! [discordant instrumental music] hiss [rumbling] hiss Oh, no! Oh, no, it's going.. boom [screaming] splash splash Everyone alright? Oh, oh, but everything is ruined. The wedding of the century is the disaster of the century. [sobbing] I wouldn't say that, Smurfette. All Woody and Laconia need for their wedding is each other. You're right, Papa Smurf. All my frills and fancy decorations 'really didn't matter at all.' I was looking for the perfect Smurf. But I'm not so perfect myself. 'Am I, Papa Smurf?' No, Smurfette, but rember, when you love someone the smurfy things about them make the unsmurfy things seem smurfy. Very, very smurfy indeed. [indistinct chattering] Well, Laconia and Woody now you have the simple wedding you wanted in the first place. You may begin your vows. We, Laconia and Woody promise to take care of each other. To share the laughter and the tears. To accept each other the way we are. To dream together, to grow together to love each other forever. I now pronounce you wood-elf and wife. [cheering] Hurray! [instrumental music] Oh, have a marriage as beautiful as I am. snort [crowd cheering] 'Smurfette caught the bouquet.' Oh, that means she'll be the next to get married. [giggling] Uh-oh. [giggling] [music continues] I still hate weddings. [music continues]
