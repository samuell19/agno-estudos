(wind blows) (synthesizer music) (ominous music) - [Woman] Hello? (laughs) Uh uh. Uh uh, I've never called the party line before. Well that's actually not true, I've called it once before, but I just listened, yeah I like to listen. (laughs) Hello? Did somebody else get on the line? So hi, oh I could definitely get into that. (laughs) You're sick. Well, I don't know, when do you want to meet? That would be great, tonight, mm hmm, I'll see you there. Bye. (ominous music) - Mmm, I'm not in the mood. Oh, I can be talked into anything. No, no preference, you name it I like it. Inhibited isn't in my dictionary sweetheart. - I'm not a tease, I've done it with plenty of guys from the party line, I told you, I'm just real picky.

(Angelina laughs) - I swear to God, I had no idea she was married. You didn't say you were married. - See, I'm a free-spirited individual right, I mean most husbands would want to come in here and rip your heart out, but not me I just want to get acquainted Mr. Curtis West. (Angelina gasps) - You told me on the party line that your name was Tom Brown Curtis, shame on you. - Will you take a look at ooh, he's a family man too. - Aren't we just full of surprises? - And you come with surprises yourself, look why don't you just give me my wallet and I'll get out of here. - I've got a great idea. Why don't we call the wife and kids and let them know what daddy's been up to, huh? Why don't we tell them daddy's been fucking my wife in my own father's house? - Look, I don't want any problem, I'm sorry. Just give me the wallet, let me get out of here. - What's the number Angelina? - Okay, let me just get out of here. - What's the number Angelina? - I don't want any problem here. I didn't know she was married. - Now I think an apology is in order here, don't you? - I said I'm sorry, I had no idea she was married. - You're supposed to be sorry, now say you're sorry. - Say you're sorry.

Voila. - What's the champagne for? - It's just my way of saying thank you. - For? - Your work. Your dedication. - Henry, you're a nice guy and not a bad boss. - Thank you. - But I don't like mixing work with pleasure. - We're not at work right now. (phone rings) - Yeah? Oh. All right, I'll be right there. - What is it? - Looks like another one. - Another body? - Mm-hmm. - Damn, that's four this month. - I'll see you at the office. - Oh, DA's here. Should be able to wrap this case up within a few minutes, right? - Who found him captain? - The bum here. - I'm not a bum, I'm homeless. - Did you get a statement? - Well, I guess you could call it that. - Okay suppose you tell me what you saw. - Well I was just standing here taking a leak and trying to relieve myself and I felt like someone was watching me and I can't do it when someone's watching me, you know what I mean? - Did you actually see someone dump the body? - Well I turned around, I saw this red fancy sports car just taking off. - Did you get the license number? - Are you crazy, I can't see a thing without my glasses. - Well, did you get all that? (grunts) - Hey ease up, will you? - She blocks it. (laughs) - You got them? - Center court mister. - All right honey, you sexy devil, I don't know how you do it. - I told you Magic and I are just like this. - You wish. - I know. - You ready? - Come on. - Okay. - All right. - Shoot left. - Shoot left. - Dribbles right. - Dribbles right. - What is he going-- - It's good, it's good. - No, oh luck, luck. - Skill. (coughs) I think I hear my computer calling me. - You know I really hate to break this up, but I've been down an alley looking at stiffs while you standing around shooting trash can basketball. - What can I say Lloyd, vice is nice. - Homicide is murder. Got a flash for you, Mr. Vice. One of your playmates is back on the street. - Who? - Who? Well I'll give you a hint. Who always makes bail before the ink is dry on the reports? - Gonzalez. - Gonzalez. - Bingo, two of his bimbos came in here with a suitcase full of cash made bail about a half hour ago. - What a business, we put them in, they let them out. (sighs) Your shot, Lloyd. - Uh, by the book this time Dan. - You really want to nail that dealer. - He's too good a cop to be wasting his time on a loser like Gonzalez. (solemn piano music) (slams piano discordantly) - Tsk, tsk, tsk, you just ruined father's favorite piece. - Darling, you were father's favorite piece. (laughs) - [Man On Phone] I'm especially fond of lips. Lips that like to explore. (laughs) - Hey baby, these lips have been places that aren't even on the map. (laughs) - Well my nick name is Sugar Lips. - [Man On Phone] Sugar, is that really you? I've been calling this party line for months trying to track you down? - Who's this? - Lenny. - Lenny? - Yeah, Mr. Footlong, the guy who can lick his own eyebrow. - I have a question for the woman who navigates without a map. - That's me. - Well, say something. - Are you there explorer? - This guy is always on here, I love his voice. - Uh, yeah, I'm here, baby. (snickers) - [Man On Phone] You have the most charming way with words. I was curious are you as adventurous as you claim? - I could do things to you that would curl your toenails. - Explorer, I want to meet you. Don't hold me in suspense any longer. - Shit, they're home only. It's only nine 0' clock. (papers rustling) - Oh, hi Mr. and Mrs. Simmons, this is my friend Alice. She just dropped by to keep me company. - Hi Alice how are you? - Hi fine. - Everything going all right Jennifer? - Fine. - Did Alison give you any trouble? She went to bed on time? - Perfect little angel as always. - Good, come on kids, we'll give you a ride home. - Uh uh, this is the first time I've called the party line. Well that's not actually true, I called once and just listened. Mm-hmm. Hello, did somebody else pick up? No, we're alone? So hi. Uh huh. (laughs) I could get into that. Mm-hmm, well it depends what type do you like? Redheads. Maybe. Well what about later on tonight? Hmm, yeah? No, no I could get into that. Well why don't we meet at your house? Okay, well then do you know Experience? Mm-hmm, that's the place. Yeah, I like it too. Uh huh. Oh that'd be (laughs) you're wild aren't you? I like that. Oh, hold on just a minute, hang on just a second. Oh, this one, this one is a gem. You are gonna love this. Let me have a bite of that. Hello, hmm? No, uh uh I'm just eating something. Oh.

Well there you are, home sweet home Alice. Good night honey, nice meeting you. Whoa, Jennifer where are you going? - That's okay, Mr. Simmons I can walk home from here. - Oh don't be silly, that's a long walk for a girl your age this time of night, no telling what kind of perverts are out there, good night Alice. (car engine thrums) (ominous music) Wait a minute Jennifer, just hold on a second here. Can we talk for a minute? Why are you sitting way over here? Oh come on, come here. - Mr. Simmons, why do we have to go through this every time I babysit for you? - Honey, why don't you call me Jack okay? - Jackass. - Honey, come here, come here. Jennifer, hey what the hell? (car door slams) (ominous music) - Ow. - I'm sorry. - You pricked me, you can't do anything right can you? - Thanks a lot Alice. Of course he had his hands all over me. What do you think I did? I slapped him. Oh, I know, I couldn't believe their timing either. Just when I was gonna about to go make a date exploring. I don't know, it's tempting, his voice just sounds so totally-- - You're not on the phone are you? I warned you about calling those party lines. - I'm in bed mom. - [Jennifer's Mom] Jennifer, your father's gonna get furious when he gets that bill. - I'm not on the party line mom. Look, I gotta go, I'll talk to you tomorrow okay. Bye. (upbeat pop music) - Good evening ladies. (upbeat pop music) So you're Gonzalez, it's good to see you again. - Thank you.

What do you want money? Here, take it. - Money, that sounds like something father would have said you know that and this was his razor, kept him very sharp, has a nasty tendency to nick. - Please, I didn't do anything to you. - No, but you had plans for me, didn't you? Does your wife know where you are tonight? - Happy kids, huh? -Action Seth, do it he's boring me. (screams) (upbeat pop music) (sniffs) (muffled talking) - Look at that now, hey does this have public toilets now? (groans) - Louie, no. (screams) - Fuck you asshole. - Shit, shit. (ominous music) (groans) - You don't want any trouble asshole, I know police brutality when I see it? - Police brutality, you mean what like this? (pipe pops) (water sprinkles) Stay here! (upbeat pop music) (ominous music) (ominous music) (motorcycle engine thrums) - Police, I need your car. (ominous music) Shit! (police radio chattering) - Yo Bridges. I know you managed to avoid catching Gonzalez, but seven times the same month, I mean that's a gotta be a new department record, huh? - Yeah, well it's been tough captain, but somebody had to break your own record, right? Bringing your girlfriends to work now Lloyd? - You know damn well if my girlfriend looked like that I'd still be at home in bed instead of standing here talking to you. Detective Dan Bridges, this is DA special investigator Stacy Sloan. - Hello. - What makes you so special investigator? - Don't pay any attention to him, it only encourages him Sloan. - I've heard a lot about you Bridges. - Yeah, you flattered or pissed? - Six cases dismissed because of illegal search and seizure, three charges on police brutality, eight lawsuits charging you with harassment of-- - I'm very proud of each and every count, each of those suspects was guilty. - DA's office is doing a full investigation on you. - I'm so happy to see that you two are getting along so well, because you're gonna be partners in this case. - What. - Right. - May I ask why? - After I do, I'm vice remember? - I know you're vice, but you're better off on homicide. Besides which, we need more manpower on this case and since you so conveniently stumbled the scene, we'll start right now. Meanwhile I'm going home, get back in bed. I am out of here. - Hey captain. - You got a problem? - Yeah. Yuppie cops like you. - I'm an assistant to the DA, not a yuppie cop. - I like them even less. - I don't really care what you like or don't like, we're not here to make friends. We're here to solve this case. - Terrific. Look, I'm not a babysitter okay, you get in my way, I'm gonna leave you behind. - I can hold my own, just make sure you hold yours. - Fine. - Fine. (police radio chattering) - All right, Sloan give me some background so we can get ahead of this. - We've only just started the investigation, we're just beginning to see a pattern now. There have been five victims, all of them married men, all of the bodies were in the Hollywood area. That's all we have. Look, I want to talk to the rest of these witnesses okay. - Be my guest. - Okay people I'd like to get a statement from any of you who may have seen or heard anything in regards to the victim or possible suspects, excuse me I'd like to get a statement from you. Excuse me, if you any of you may have a statement you could give me if you're a witness to the-- (gun shot rings out) - Don't get your panties in a bunch, it's a blank okay Can we have your attention? Right, they're all yours. - Are there any witnesses here? - Yo, I saw that guy leave the club with a good-looking redhead. - Uh, I saw a woman get into that Mercedes when I first got here. - What did she look like? - Red hair, beautiful dress, I didn't think anything of it until a few moments ago when I saw here tear out of here in a red BMW. - Yeah, I think I saw her too, she turned left down there. - Officer, get an APB on that BMW now, pull over anything that remotely resembles it in a five mile radius. Thank you, let's go lieutenant. - What was the point of that? - Just doing my civic duty. - Lieutenant, thanks for waiting. (car engine thrums) - What civic duty, you are not gonna spoil my good time. - I need to see some ID? - What? - I need your name and address for a report. - Sure. (upbeat pop music) - Do me a favor would you? You're sitting on my lunch. (paper bag rustles) - Thank you. - Did you have to fire your gun? - It worked, didn't it? - [Police Radio] 117, 117, we have a red BMW with suspects at corner of Mountain and La Scienica. - Two blocks. (upbeat pop music) # Don't ask that to me (upbeat pop music) (ominous music) # If you scream my name, come back to my body please # Don't ask that to me (police radio chattering) (car squeals) - [Dan] Damn, if it isn't her? (crowd claps) (upbeat pop music) - You look so sad baby brother. - Don't treat me like one of them. - Everything all right here? - Oh yeah, everything's fine. It's just a little family spat. This is my baby brother Seth. Seth, this is (laughs) I'm sorry I forgot your name. - Kirk. - Kirk, surely you jest Kirk. - Find something amusing with my name? - No, I find it nauseating. - Seth, you know how I abhor violence. Listen Kirk, I'm gonna go to the ladies room, but I will would really love to dance with you some more later. - Maybe I could use a refresher myself. - I want to talk to the victim's wife. - Nah, let a uniform take a statement, won't be much good to us in her condition tonight. (police siren rings) - [Stacy] Oh, wonderful a cop giving a ticket to a cop. - I know that sorry excuse for driving anywhere. (laughs) Hi. - Hi. - I saw you on TV, you're with the DA's office, right? - That's right. Well well well, back in homicide eh Dan? - Word travels fast. - I'm psychic. Listen, I better let you two get going. Make sure he gets home in one piece okay? See you later Danny boy. - Cover your ass, Butch. - Always. - Butch? - Short for Brotowski. - I thought it was against regulations for you to be involved with another officer. - Involved, oh Butch and I aren't involved. Just old fishing buddies. # But tonight that's not the only thing I'm asked # Express to make (upbeat pop music) (ominous music) - What the fuck do you want man? (ominous music) (upbeat pop music) # I want to dance all night oh baby - Come on, let's get out of here. I think the police might come back. - I'm having fun. - I saw him leave with someone else. - Are you sure? - Yeah. (upbeat pop music) - Didn't anyone teach you that haste makes waste? - Honey, why don't you come to bed? Come on, the bills can wait. - No they won't, most of these are overdue now. When was the last time Jennifer sat for us before tonight? - Two weeks ago, why? - What was the date? - The 15th. - Are you sure? - I should hope so. It was our anniversary. Let me go fix myself a little snack. I'll be right back. - [Woman On Phone] Hello, who's this? - Well who's this? - Well I asked you first. - This is Samson. - Samson, ooh Samson? You gotta lot of muscles huh? - Rock hard baby. - Who are you people? - Who are you? - I'm Jack. I found this number on my phone bill. - [Woman On Phone] Well you got the party line, sweetheart. - The party line? - Uh huh. - Yeah baby, let's party. - Hey Jack, you got muscles like Samson? - No one's got muscles like Samson. - I don't know about this Samson, but you haven't met big Jack yet. - Okay lieutenant let's hear it. Why didn't you want this assignment? - Short and sweet? I don't like Bulls. - Do you know the district attorney personally? - I know he's an asshole. - What's that supposed to mean? - Let's just say it gets old putting my butt on the line every day so that some politician like Wilson can shoot me down over some technicality. - Those technicalities protect people's rights. - I'm talking about tracking down a cold-blooded child killer five years ago, while you were still sweating over grades in criminology. And that son of a bitch red handed me. Wilson wouldn't prosecute because we didn't follow proper police procedure. - 117, 117 do you copy? - Yeah. - Respond immediately to a homicide at Experience Night Club. - We're working on it. - No sweetie, it's another one. - Run around in circles. (police radio chattering) - Well it looks like the murder weapon was a straight razor just like our friend in the Mercedes. - Any witnesses? Nobody saw it. (gentle music box music) (ominous orchestral music) (TV announcer talking) (ominous music) (ominous music) - [TV News Announcer] In other local news, authorities continue to look at mysterious circumstances surrounding a double murder at Experience, the trendy West Hollywood night club. The killings occurred within an hour of each other and seemed to be the work of the same razor-wielding assailant. The suspect was seen leaving the scene of the crime in a red BMW, after the break-- - I just saw it on the news, you killed that other guy too, didn't you, huh, huh? No wonder you were in such a hurry to leave. And you told me that he left with somebody else? I liked him. - Stop hitting me. - How dare you move on your own. I had other plans for him. - You're blowing it Seth and I am not going to prison because of your-- - Stop hitting me. - You struck me, you little bastard. - I'm sorry Angelina I didn't mean to hurt you. Just don't hit me. - What are you doing in here anyway? You are really sick. - I miss her Angelina. - (laughs) You miss her? Well what do you miss the most? Maybe it was the way she stumbled around here ranting and raving like some drunken old whore huh? With a bottle of wine in one hand and a cigarette in the other? Or maybe, maybe it was the way she bossed you around like a little momma's boy. Seth, darling, practice your piano. Oh Seth, don't play with that. - Mother loved me! - Yes, mother loved her darling little baby boy. But what about Angelina? What did she do when I went to her and I told her what father was doing to me? She blamed me for it. I say good riddance to both of them. (slap rings out) And let me tell you something else, you pathetic little momma's boy, you ever so much as bat an eye without my say so and I'll be out of here so fast you won't even have time to say goodbye. - Don't leave me Angelina, I need you. - Oh, don't tell me our little momma's boy is going to cry. - Don't call me that. - Momma's boy, oh your hand Seth, protect them, don't play with-- - Stop it! - You special momma's boy. Momma's boy. - I said stop. - You are a pathetic little momma's boy. (Seth cries) Come to momma. (Seth cries) (ominous music) (sexy saxophone jazz music) (sighs) (sexy saxophone jazz music) - When did you get in? - Hey how you doing? Afew minutes ago, I didn't want to wake you. - Gee, I don't know if I should be grateful or hurt. What's that? - Homework. - Mm, is Ms. Sloan being tough on you Danny boy? - Nah, this new case giving everybody problems. - What's wrong? - No finger prints, no witnesses. This guy is either very smart or very lucky. - So tell me how do you like working with your new partner? - Goes by the book. - Mm, did she say anything about me? - Getting jealous huh? - (laughs) Did she? - Yeah she did, something about being against the rules for two cops to be involved. I told her we weren't involved. - Thanks. - Just old fishing buddies. - Oh, well, I think you got a bite buddy. - Hey, I'll give you a bite. (sexy saxophone jazz music) (ominous music) (breathes heavily) (sexy saxophone music) (curtain jingles) - Ugh, it's terrible. - Would you excuse us please? This is your new partner? - Yeah. - Why didn't you consult me on it? - I didn't have a choice Captain Barnes assigned him. - The man is a dangerous hot-headed jackass, he'll get you killed. - He had a lot of nice things to say about you too. - He's unstable, he has no respect for the law and I want him off my case. - Shirley, good to see you. - Would you give me a break? - Hey, I'm sorry I tried to keep them out. - Mr. District Attorney was it your idea to put Bridges back on homicide? - Don't you people have anything better to do with your time? - I believe it was Captain Barnes' decision. - Any leads lieutenant? - No comment. - All right, people please (coughs) Lieutenant Bridges was assigned to this case because of his past accomplishments with homicide. - Well what about the west side child killer? It was you who refuse to prosecute. - Yes it was, but I was forced to do that. You see it is my responsibility under the law to uphold the due process of all citizens. Now perhaps of if the lieutenant had been a little more mindful of the proper procedure, those children might be alive today. - Oh, you son of a bitch. (ominous music) - Dan, if you weren't such an idiot sometimes, you'd be much further along in this force. Man you really gotta do something about your temper. Why don't you take a seminar or something? - Save it Lloyd, I should have belted the son of a bitch a long time ago. - Well, I've been tempted myself a few times. (sighs) - Sit down sergeant, I was beginning to get interested in this case, hmph. - Thanks a lot lieutenant I was counting on you. - Yeah, well that's the breaks. - Look I could still use your help. Henry doesn't even have to know. - I'm going fishing. What are you gonna do? - I'm on my way out to Bel Air to talk to some of the witnesses from the club last night. - Good luck. - Thanks. (calm saxophone jazz music) (piano tone rings) (calm saxophone jazz music) (objects rustle) (discordant piano music) (door bell rings) - Hello, I'm Inspector Sloan from the District Attorney's office, we met last night. - Yes, I remember you. - I'd like to ask you a few more questions if I could. - I gave the officer my statement last night. Yeah, I realize that but sometimes you can remember more the next day after you have a good night's sleep. - Actually I was on my way out of here. - I promise I'll only take a moment of your time. - I told the officer everything I saw. - Mm-hmm, it was a red-haired woman in a red BMW. - Yes, that's right, now if you don't mind. - Nothing else, no distinguishing characteristics? - No, no, but if I remember anything I'll be sure to let you know. That's my sister, look she doesn't know anything about this and I'd prefer to keep her out of this actually. - Could you identify this woman in a lineup? - You have someone in custody? - No, not yet. - Yeah, give me a call and I'll be glad to help out in any way I can. (ominous music) - A Posendorf Imperial, my grandfather had one of these. - Please, please do not touch that. It was my mothers' please. - Seth, who's your friend? - Angelina, this is Ms. Sloan. - We were just-- - Just talking about this beautiful piano, it seems we have a mutual interest in music. - How nice. Seth, you really should entertain your friends at the house more often, this place needs people. - Well thank you for your help Seth, I really should be going. - Oh please don't rush off. - No, I really should be going. - Well then promise us that you'll make time to come and visit us again real soon. - Well thank you that's very nice. (ominous music) (rips sheet music) - I hope you're satisfied. - She doesn't suspect anything. As far as she's concerned, I'm a model citizen. - You're a model fool. - Please don't get angry. (ominous music) - Don't touch me. (ominous music) (rips dress) (grunts) (cries) (ominous music) (ominous music) - Hi Ruth. - Hi Stacy. - Run a check through CCI on these two people for me please. - [Ruth] Okay, might be a while though, the computers are down again. - I'll be in my office. - Special delivery. - What is it? - Lab reports. They apologize for the delay, it seems that some idiot misplaced some of your evidence. - A wig. - I'm sorry what? - The hair we found from the Mercedes, it's definitely from a wig. It looks like the same razor. - You know I'm beginning to wish I didn't let you head up this investigation. - Why? - Because we hardly see each other anymore. - Henry please, I have a lot of information to look at. - Okay. (sighs) (calm synthesizer music) (bicycle engine revs) (calm synthesizer music) (police siren wails) (calm synthesizer music) (calm synthesizer music) (ominous music) - Where's the fire? That's a nice car. The trouble with nice cars is there's always a temptation to see what they can do. - Yeah. - Let's see your license and registration. - That's interesting. (ominous music) (screams) (phone rings) (calm jazz music) - Yeah? - [Lloyd] Dan, I've got some bad news for you. Butch is dead. (calm saxophone jazz music) - Serious as a heart attack baby. You name the place. - What's he saying? What's he saying? - Shh. - How about a cafe or something, some place open. - That's all right, Cafe Pacifica. - [Jennifer] Perfect I'll see you in an hour. - Wear something red. - What? Something red. I'll wear something red hot, but how will I know it's you? - Red suspenders. - Red suspenders? What are you a fireman? Well, that remains to be seen hot stuff. (ominous music) - Well? - He says he's gonna put out my fire. - You did it? You're really going through with it? - Still angry with me? - Well I like the way you handled that, good work baby brother. (knocks on door) - Oh, this is the first night in a month I've gotten to sleep before the sun rises. Who is it? - Lieutenant Dan Bridges. I want that son of a bitch. I want him. - Dan, I'm really sorry. - Was it him? - Possibly yeah. - What about the weapon? The news said her throat was cut. - It was a straight razor. They also found some hair on her uniform. It matches the hair we found in the hand of last night's victim. (knocks on door) Who is it? - [Henry] It's me Henry. - Stay here and be quiet. We don't need a scene. - You alone? I thought I heard someone. - I couldn't sleep I was watching television. Now what do you want Henry? - Well I want to talk, I didn't want to leave it the way it was at the office. You miss me, admit it come on. - [Stacy] Look, we'll talk about it in the morning okay. - Maybe I should take you off this case. I mean you haven't been the same since it started. - Henry, leave before I say something you might regret. - That I might regret? - Yes, that you might regret. (door slams) - Get dressed. - What? - We're not gonna catch this guy in our sleep. - All right. (upbeat pop music) (ominous music) - There he is. There are the red suspenders. - [Alice] Oh my God, he is so cute. - [Jennifer] Who's that? - Well hello, fireman. - You sounded different on the party line. - Well you look exactly like I imagined you. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. So you ready to do some exploring? - Hey, is that Mr. Simmons? - Uh, excuse me but I believe I heard you people talking on the party line. - Maybe. - Well listen I'm kinda new in town and I was just looking to meet some people, I'm sorry to butt in, but to tell you the truth but she sounds an awful lot like somebody I know. - Three's a crowd. - Sorry. - But I have a sister who might like you. Do you mind? - Not at all, the more the merrier is my motto. - Shall we? - Why not? (ominous music) - Mr. Simmons is going with them. - Look, can't we just go home? This is getting way too weird for me. - I love champagne. Makes me do the wildest things. It brings out the beast inside. - Well it sure makes me horny. - Listen, I've got a confession to make. I've talked to you all on the party line. But I'm really not the girl you thought you were gonna meet. - I knew it, the other girl sounded like my babysitter. - Babysitter? Jack, are you a married man? - Yep. - Well then I'd better get a little more champagne. We don't watch Jack to start thinking about the little wife. - Okay tiger. Let's see if I can't tame that beast in you huh? (moans) - I'll (calm piano music) I maybe I could help. - That's sweet. Jack, don't be in too much of a hurry. I'll be right back. Pop this. (calm piano music) - You bet. - What's the matter, don't you like me huh? Oh relax. You're so tense. Come on baby, you know you want to party with me just a little huh, yeah, yeah yeah? (laughs) Mm, oh yeah, mm. Yeah, that's right. See I know what you're all about because I'm just like you. - Looks like you got a live one Seth. I wish all your girls were this much fun. - So do I. - So where's your friend huh? - He's indisposed. - Oh. - Why don't you come and join the party for a little bit, huh? - Oh, let's have a little snack first. Cold cuts? - [Dan] Okay, we got two reports, right? We got a sample from a wig, we got a sample from a real head of hair. - [Stacy] The results from the pathology lab say that the razor cut according to the angle had to occur outside of the car. The victim was inside the car, a struggle and the criminal-- - Right there was hair in the hand, so there was definitely a struggle so either-- - What? - Either it could be a transvestite or two people. (calm jazz music) - Thanks. - So where are we? - All the evidence leads to two killers, a man and a woman. - Right, now the victims were married men, no wedding rings and dressed for a night on the town. - Except the second victim at Fantasia, he was single. - Yeah, but I think he was in the wrong place at the wrong time, just like Butch. - So these guys were fooling around. - Yeah, they were going on blind dates and never coming back. Question is were they being set up or being picked at random? I think they're being set up, but how, how? You got those phone records in? - Yeah, Ruth should be in, I'll check. Ruth, did you get the phone records yet? - Yes, they're here. - Could you bring them in? Right. - Sorry, didn't know you were here. - That's all right. Thanks Ruth. This is for three months. - Looks like our friends like to talk on the phone. (papers rustling) - This guy spends more in one month than I spend in a whole year. - Wait a minute, look at this. - 976, 976, it's the same here. 976. - 976. - It's all over the place. - Party line, looks like gender is not all our victims have in common. (ominous music) - It's obvious these things are practically interchangeable. - They all called more than one party line. The question is which one of these party lines is the one we're looking for? - You know what? - We should match the calls and see if any of them were made on the same party line at the same time. - Good idea. I've got a contact at the phone company. (phone rings) - Yeah. (sighs) I'll be right there. Two more bodies just turned up in Malibu. - What's he doing here, police personnel only. - Henry, I think I may have-- - Captain get that man out of my sight. - Henry, listen to me. - Stacy, don't mess with me on this one. - Would you forget your stupid pride and just listen to me for a second? - No, that's it, now you're off the case and I want your files now. - Why? Because I won't sleep with you? - What are you doing here Dan? - We're on to something captain. I can feel it. - You've been suspended, I don't want to hear this. - It's personal now. - You won't give it up will you, you won't let it go? Would you? Let's go, don't worry about him. (calm saxophone jazz music) - He's way too old for you. - I just want to see if I can talk to him again. - You're not calling from my house, my mom had a cow last time I got a phone bill. - Oh my God, look. - The following are sketches of the two victims whose bodies were found just a few hours ago here at Point Doom in Malibu. If anyone has any information regarding the identities of either victims, please call the Los Angeles District Attorney's office, this is Kimberly Lewis reporting to you from Point Doom, KWIN News. - I'm sure it was him. - I can't get involved in this Jennifer. My parents will kill me. - Alice, we're talking about murder here. Besides, I think we saw the creep who did it. - Oh now he's a creep, yesterday he was gorgeous. Besides you don't know for sure if it was him. - Alice, why don't you just go home? I'll tell him I was there by myself. - You mean it? - Yeah, go on, go home. - Oh, you're the best. I won't forget this. - I can't believe that pompous ass. - How long were you and Wilson involved? - None of your business. - True. - What am I doing, I just spend 400 bucks trying to stop smoking. - So what are you gonna do? - I'm gonna turn it over to Henry. - Just like that. - Yeah, just like that. - Oh, that's terrific, that's great. - But not before I make copies for both of us. - All right. (ominous music) (phone buzzes) - [Ruth] Ms. Sloan, there's a young girl that was referred by the front desk. - I don't want to talk to anybody right now. - [Ruth] She says it's about the murders. - Send her in. (ominous music) - Are you the woman that I saw on TV? The one who's investigating the murders? - Yes I am. - What can we do for you? - I think I know who killed Mr. Simmons. - More. - More hair? - Yeah. - Right. Good work Tommy, I owe you one. - No. - All right. Phone company records show that everyone of them called that same party line. Good luck you didn't keep that date Jennifer. - Could you identify his voice if you heard it on the phone? - Yes. - I think it's time we called this party line. What's the best time to call these party lines Jennifer? - Any time, but night time's the best. - Are you sure you don't mind Jennifer? - No. (typewriter rattling) - Now I'm late for my fundraiser. - Ms. Sloan requested this information. I can't locate her, I thought you might like to see it. - Ms. Sloan is no longer on the case. - [Man On Phone] I've got just what you're looking for baby, there ain't a man alive that can top what I'm packing. - Get lost creep, I'm looking for a real man. I'm looking for a fireman. - [Man On Phone] Honey, I'll be whatever you want me to be. - [Jennifer] I said take a hike. - [Man On Phone] Hey baby, I'm the man you're looking for. - I said a real man, you sound like a eunuch or something. - [Man On Phone] Up yours too bitch. - [Woman On Phone] Hey sugar, why don't you and I get together, I'll make you forget about men completely. - I'm sorry. - I think we should call it a night. - He'll show up, I know he will. He always does. It's just we're too early. - It's late enough, your parents are gonna be really worried where you are. - No they won't, I told them I was spending the night with my girlfriend Alice, she'll cover for me. - Dan, can I speak to you for a minute? - Sure. - Relax Jennifer. - I don't like this at all. - What? - First we get this 16-year-old girl to lie to her parents and now we have her making obscene phone calls to a complete stranger. - Something she's done a hundred times before. - I don't care I don't like it. - I don't like it either, but it's all we've got at the moment. - I'm responsible, do you realize-- - I understand. - If anything happens, I'm responsible. - It's party time. Anybody out there want to party? - Ms. Sloan, hurry. - [Woman On Phone] What did you have in mind party boy? - Yeah, I like champagne. - It's him. - You sure? - Yes. - Okay, see if you can get him to meet you. (button clanks) - Hey boy scout, this is the explorer. Remember me? - Did he hang up? - No, keep talking. - I was running a little late the other night. Were you there? I mean saw a man in red suspenders walking away with a woman with a red sweater and another man. Was that you? You sure looked hot, I mean if that was you. Look, I'm really bummed that I missed out like that. Won't you give me another chance? - [Man On Phone] I think your boy scout hung up baby. That's his loss isn't it? - [Seth] Okay, explorer, I'll give you one more chance. But you stand me up this time and daddy just might have to spank you. - Bad girls should be spanked. I promise I'll be good. Meet me at Fantasia, 110' clock. - What's he gonna be wearing? - And wear that sexy fireman's outfit. (ominous saxophone music) - You did good, it's great. You did great. - Thanks. (ominous music) - I've got a special date for us tonight. - Really? - The lady, the one who saw me leave the cafe with that Simmons fellow and the other lady, I want to get her. - You're sicker than I thought. - No, no, I've got it all figured out and we can tell if it's a setup or not. - You can do whatever you want. - Where are you going? - Rome, just as far away from you as I can get. - You don't think I did this, do you? - I know you did. - Angelina, please listen to me. - You listen to me, the fun and games are over. You're blowing it. It's just a matter of time before they catch you and I'm not gonna be here when they do. - Angelina-- - Don't start that stuff with me, momma's boy. - I'll be good I promise! - Momma's boy! (ominous music) - Angelina, please. Please don't leave me. (ominous music) - Would I do that to you? Let mommy kiss it and make it feel better. (ominous music) Better? (moaning) (ominous music) Ugh. You're just like all the rest. (ominous music) - No, I'm not, no I'm not. - Oh yes, you're just like daddy, momma's boy. Get out off of me, let go of me. - No, I'm not! (screaming) (ominous music) (ominous music box music) (ominous music) - Here you go Jennifer. - Thank you. - Ah you're welcome. - Can't I go with you? - Jennifer, this is not a game, this is very dangerous business. - How are you gonna recognize him? - Because you gave us a very good description. And with his fireman's getup I'll find him believe me. Wow. (sexy saxophone music) That should get his attention. (ominous music) - You like it? - I like it. - You sure you want to go through with this? Might get tough. - Yeah. Yeah. - Good luck. (ominous electronic music) (upbeat pop music) - Here you go sir. - I didn't order this. - Compliments of the little lady over there. Excuse me, excuse me. Jennifer, what the hell are you doing here? - You need positive identification. - I want you out of here right now. - What are you gonna do, arrest me? - Don't play games with me, now you-- - Look, Stacy's going somewhere, oh when you gotta go, you gotta go. - Don't move. (upbeat pop music) All right, you wanna help, do me a favor, just go in there and check it out and don't try to be a hero you see anything suspicious I'll be right outside the door, okay? (upbeat pop music) - It's okay, she's in there alone. Hey, that's him. - Where? - Over there. - You stay right here. (upbeat pop music) (ominous music) (muffled screaming) - We can go home now, Angelina. (ominous music) - It's not him! - Ah, it's a setup! Get out of the way. (screams) (upbeat pop music) (ominous music) (upbeat pop music) - She's gone. - Take your hands off her. - Stay here, you hear me? (ominous music) (car engine revs) - That Ferrari, who was in it? - Couple of girls, one of them looked pretty loaded to me. - Blond hair, red dress? - Yeah, nice ass too. - Damn! (ominous music) Son of a bitch! (ominous music) Did you notice the license plate? - Yeah, one of these personalized ego jocks. - Do you remember it? - No. - Look, I'm a police officer, please try to remember. - I don't care if there's a carjacked. - Hey listen to me, you son of a bitch, someone's life in danger. Now you try to remember that plate. - It's over there on the clip, we just run it on when they come in our club. (ominous music) - Police, I need your phone. (upbeat pop music) - Data control, Sergeant Thompson speaking. - Beth, I need a favor, I need a plate number. Plate number is-- - Buddy, you got a problem here? - Yeah, I'm a policeman, this is an emergency. - That's fine, why don't you let me see a badge? - Here's my badge, now back off. - That's, that's a badge. Hey, get these people out of here. (ominous music) - I knew you wouldn't leave me Angelina. (ominous music) It's party time. (ominous music) - Dan, you're suspended, you want me in the unemployment line with you? - He's got Stacy and she's gonna die if you don't give me that address. - What's the hurry? Party's only just begun. Is this what you're looking for Ms. Investigator? (whimpers) I want you to know the bullets must have fallen out. I've got four here and I know this holds five. - Okay, I have a Bel Air address for you. 144 Palm Drive. - I got it. Tell the captain to send some backup. - Will do, Dan, listen, please be careful. - Thank you. - Who was that? Dan? (ominous music) - Out of the car police officer, out of the car come on, move it, move it. - Hey, look at me. I put this on just for you. You never appreciate anything that I do for you. That's better, you weren't thinking of leaving again were you? Father's gone. He can't hurt you anymore, you and mother are safe now.
