[static on radio] [gunshot] You're all clear. [grunts] DEA! [shouting in Spanish] [gunfire] [shouting] Secure the area. [gunshot] - [gunshot] - [body thuds] [DEA agent] Clear. Throw down your weapon. Throw down your weapon! Throw down your weapon. Down! [DEA Agent 2] ¡Abajo! On your knees. Hands up. Turn around. Turn around! [grunts] [grunting] [DEA agent] Cap! James. We need him alive. You gotta check this out. [screaming] [screaming] [crickets chirping] [footsteps approaching] - Where'd you get that? - You like it? - Looks expensive. - It was. I mean it is. I... I got it from a friend. She didn't need it anymore. Mom wanted you to come down. She said Dad should be here soon. All right, I'll be there in a minute. [car approaching] [door opens] Daddy! [laughs] Hey, sweetie! - How are you? - How you doin'? - I'm good. - [sighs] Got a little banged up, though. - You okay? - I'll be fine. - [James] Hey, you. - Hey. [chuckles] I remember you. Why are you limping? Uh, bug bite. It'll be okay. It's nice to have you home. I feel much better now. [men shouting] - Watch your back, man. - [inmate] Hey, Johnny. I heard you were getting out today. We got some unfinished business. Oh, Jesus. [groans] Listen. I don't wanna have any trouble, all right? - I'm getting out soon and... - [grunts] [grunting] [grunting] Hey, bitch, here. Fuck this, man. [grunts] [exhales] I can't wait to get the fuck out of here. Jesus. [parole officer] Aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, three counts of first-degree armed robbery. Do you take your responsibility for your actions? What I feel bad about is, uh... [hisses] You know, I killed somebody's husband. His name was George and he had two kids, and... [sighs] I took that away from them, and I'm sorry about it, but, um, I'll always be sorry about it. I'm just... You know, I just wanna... I don't know what I wanna do. I just wanna be the best man I can be. You have quite the impressive military record. A Silver Star, two Purple Hearts, three tours of duty. Afghanistan. Iraq. I think that if anyone deserves another chance, it's you, sir. I hope to God I never see you again. You know, honestly, I could kinda tell something was going on. Like, I could feel it. And then Tom said that he liked Serafina, and I was like... [indistinct chatter] [screaming] No, no! Dad? Girls, could you excuse us for a second? Are you all right? I'm okay. I guess you don't wanna talk about what happened. - Talk about what? - [chuckles] I'm glad you're still a sarcastic asshole. Yeah, well, I try. What's going on? - Babe... - Just... Anybody up for some dessert? [James] Wow. [chuckles] Look at that cake. And I got you guys this. Huh? Open it. Sunrose Cabins? At first, I thought we could all go together this weekend, like old times. But now I see that you two need some "alone" time. Where did you get that money? Serafina's mom got it as a giveaway at some event, and they couldn't use it, so they asked if we wanted it. Okay. Right? Yeah, why not? Thanks, babe. [Mom] Well, thank you. [car approaching] - Oh, goddamn! - Johnny! Oh, goddamn, so nice to see you. Oh! Good to see you, man. Oh, it's been so long. Been a long time. You look good. Thanks for the ride. Let me get your stuff, man. - It's good to have you home. - Johnny's back! [car door opens] Let's get the fuck outta here. Listen, I've heard what you two have been doin'. It's all over the tube. Everybody knows y'all are going straight now. I did promise, uh, Ma and Pa I'd keep you on the straight and narrow, so you've just gotta, you know, do the right thing, lay low. Keep our shit tight. Well, you got the money, right? I knew you still had it. Where is it? Listen, I don't want you two involved, all right? We can get it in and out. No problem at all. Just tell us where you put it. If they catch your ass with the money, they're gonna send you back there. Oh, I ain't gonna worry about that. Ain't nobody gonna find shit. Listen, I'm hungry. Let's grab a hot dog somewhere. Sounds good to us. Our old house? [Rudy] Brilliant. We looked everywhere. Never thought you'd put it in there. [Rudy] You okay? Yeah. I'm getting there. Listen, here's a map I drew where I put everything. Piece of cake. [Matthew] We won't let you down, Johnny. Listen, boys, the only thing I really give a fuck about is that ring. Okay? We got some serious shit we gotta take care of, all right? Don't let nothing fuck it up, all right? You hear me? - We got you. - We got it. Just keep it cool until we get the job done. - All right? - Yes, sir. All right.

[chuckles] [car door opens] [James] You know, babe, this could really be like a second honeymoon. Wow. This place is really nice. [sighs] Is something on your mind? I didn't recognize you when you came home. James Baker. And you are? Lisa Rodriguez. Nice to meet you. Babe, I'm still the same man you married. I don't want you working for them anymore. I'm not. - Really? - Really. Why? I'm just not. What are you gonna do? [sighs] I don't know. But I'm starting to get an idea. - [chuckles] - Come here. I got a bad fucking feeling about this. You'll be all right. [footsteps approaching] Just stay close to me. [sighs] Four of them. There's Daddy, Mommy and their two daughters. Piece of cake. But hands off my two cupcakes. 'Cause they're mine. We're just going in to make sure it's all there. We're gonna wait until they're gone to actually get it. Ah, fuck. Where's the fun in that? Johnny wants it quiet. And clean.

[Lisa] Go back to your rooms, right now. Right now! James. Give me the gun. Give me the gun. [James breathing heavily] Baby. You've gotta get help. I'm all right. Oh, what the fuck? We should have killed him. I need to think. Think? You're always fucking thinking! Stop thinking! All right? Now we know who the fuck we're dealing with. Right? So why don't we just fuck off back home, think of something else? We'll come back later and take care of business. [breathes heavily] Fuck. [breathes heavily] Baby. I need help. What are we gonna do about this? I don't think we should keep that in the house for a while. Baby, I'd understand it if you want me to leave. Oh. No, baby, no. I'm not gonna leave you. [doorbell rings] Every night? I knew you were having a hard time, but I... Yeah. That's why I need you here. I'm afraid I'm gonna hurt my family. Hey. We're not gonna let that happen. You got me? It'll just be for a little while, just till I get this under control. I am here as long as you need. Appreciate it. [therapist on computer] There's nothing wrong with you, James. [James scoffs] I'm serious. What you experienced is a normal reaction to extremely abnormal experiences. [James sighs] [James] So what am I supposed to do? How do I tell from what's real and what's... you know. Start with one thing you can see with your eyes. The tree. Then what can you hear with your ears? I can hear the buzzing of my air conditioner. What can you sense with your skin? My collar on my neck. My watch on my arm. What do you taste? The coffee I just drank on my tongue. Now, what do you smell? My perfume. Those flowers. Focusing on your five senses will get you out of your head and back to the present. Now, you try. What do you see? [therapist laughs] You're going to have to try a lot harder than that. Um, Jennifer's drawing. [therapist] Good. Now, what do you hear? [exhales] [sighs] [phone beeps] - [cell phone ringing] - Ah. Hey. Talk to me. What? I don't understand. What do you mean, "not yet"? Look, look, do what you gotta do. We went over it, just... All right. I'll take care of it. No worries. We got this. All right. No, it's cool. Bye. [phone beeps] Mmm, mmm, mmm. Yeah, honey, I got it all written down. I won't forget the milk. Milk, butter, cereal. I got it, honey. All right, I'll see you soon. Love you too. Bye. Wife busting the chops again, huh? Let me give you a little marriage advice. She's the boss. Whatever she says goes. Happy wife, happy life. Here's the file you asked for. - You take care of that. I gotta run. - All right. Hey. Well, goddamn! Goddamn! Oh! What you doin'? Oh! - Are you sneakin' up on me? Huh? - Yeah. - Mr. Policeman! Yeah. - Yeah, well, look at you. - Look at you, man. Filled out. - Yeah, little bit. - You look like a million bucks, brother. - And you do too. - Well, they finally let you out, huh? - Yeah. I was beginning to think they were gonna keep your ass locked up forever. Yeah, well, you know, it felt like forever. Listen, coz, uh, I need your help on something. Well, must be serious, huh? What's in it for me? More money than you're making doing what you're doing, bro. - Yeah? - Yeah. I can cut your ass in for 2% of three million. Two percent of three million. Let's see... That's $60,000. Well, it must be something serious, huh? Well, this is my career we're talking about. I'm gonna have to ask for about 10% on that. Deal. You got it. All right, man. Let's make some money. - Let's make some money. - All right. Welcome back. Let's make some noise, bro. Let's go have a beer. Yeah. Come on. Let's go find us a supermodel or two. Now we're talking. [both laugh] [birds chirping] Sometimes I... I can't tell what's real... or what's in my head. There's nothing to be ashamed of with PTSD. You just have to take it one day at a time. It takes time. Your brain is still processing a traumatic experience. The next time you're in that compound, here's an exercise you can do. Every time you look at your thumb, ask yourself, "Is this real or is this fake?" Say it out loud. Is this real? Or is this fake? Or is this fake? Well? Real. Good. That's a good start. Keep doing it until it becomes a habit. [therapist] You're still going on vacation with your wife? [James sighs] I don't know. [therapist] You should. I think it'd be good for you two. She needs you too, James. Just as much as you need her right now. Don't shut her out. [knocking on door] Mr. James Baker? - Hello. - Hey. Well, I appreciate you coming down here, sir. Yeah. So how can I help you, Sheriff? Well, it seems we've got ourselves a little problem. What kinda problem? Well, it's probably not gonna amount to much. I know you're DEA and all that. Well, I got a warrant here with your name on it. James Baker, yeah? "Breach of Peace"? This is bullshit. - I just got here. - [chuckles] Well... it must have followed you from San Antone. - This makes no sense. - Hmm. Listen, I got a buddy in the government. He sent me your record. Hope you don't mind. But I gotta tell ya, I'm very impressed. DEA, military. Phew. But it also says that you were just diagnosed with PTSD. Post-Traumatic Stress. That's a terrible thing. See, I was in the service myself, and, well, let's say I knew a lot of guys who pretended they were sick so they could get a little extra on their pension. That's a shameful thing to do. What the fuck? This is signed by the attorney's office. There's no judge's signature on this. There's not? No. No. Let me see that goddamn thing. Well, I'll be damned. You're right. [laughs] I don't know what you're trying to pull, but next time you try to bring me down here, you contact my superiors, my RAC, and don't waste my time. Hmm. Deputy, will you show this gentleman out? What the fuck did you have me come down here for anyway? [chuckles] [groans] [receiver clatters] - [line ringing] - [exhales] Yeah, he just left. [chuckles] Yeah. [groans] They're leaving. This is an in-and-out job. No more problems. This ain't your average snatch and grab, boys. We gotta make this one calculated. - We'll see about that. - Yeah, we fucking will. You gotta keep your head in this one, man. Well, let's fucking see. Ho! Let's go! What are we waitin' for now? Fucking Christmas? Dominic, relax. What if they forgot something? Forgot something? What the fuck are they gonna forget? Let's fucking do this! Man. Keep your fucking head. [whispers] Ah. Fucking head! [tapping on dashboard] [Rudy] You wanna knock that the fuck off? [dance music playing on speakers] Mom and Dad are gonna be pissed. They'll never know. Isn't that what they say in the movies before they get caught? Then they won't be surprised when they catch us. You. Catch you. Catch me. Whatever. I had nothing to do with this. It's not like I invited the whole school. Hit that shit! [rock music playing on radio] Oh! [chuckles] Didn't get the invite. It's melon ice. Yo, yo, yo. Kiwi's the best flavor, no cap. Tom, that's so cap, bro. You're like 50% cap, 50%... - What? - [all laugh] Naughty! Let's go! Let's go! Let's fucking go! Let's go, let's go! We're doing this, Tommy boy! Whoo! Why you so riled up, Tom? Why you so riled up right now? Good job, bitch! - So, uh... - Her parents are gone. - But what about Natalie? - Don't worry about her. Look, I'll handle her, you handle Dyana. All right. [chuckles] [door bell ringing] I'll be in my room. You know, maybe if you were nicer to people, you'd have more friends. Maybe if you weren't, people wouldn't think you were so vapid. [footsteps departing] [all] Hey! Whoo! Okay, okay. Somebody gonna get it in tonight! - Somebody gonna get it in! - [laughs] The more, the merrier. [screaming] [whispers] Is this real? Is this real? [James clears throat] Are you gonna tell me what happened? Are you sure you wanna know? Of course I wanna know. [sighs] If we can... James. Just tell me. Okay. Pull over. [turn signal clicking] [muffled dance music playing on speakers] [muffled chattering] Are you kidding me? [grunts] Damn it. What? There was a firefight. We exchanged gunfire. After we'd taken the... the men down... [exhales] ...there was... We saw blood coming from underneath a closet. And when we opened the closet, there... there were... a mother and two daughters. [Lisa gasps] They had been killed by our gunfire. Uh... [groans] Babe, I see them. I see them. It was an accident. It's not your fault. That's just it. It was. I... - Baby... - It was just a mistake. [sighs] It was my mistake. [sniffles] [sighs] I love you. You know that, right? I love you too, babe. [chuckles] I'm sorry I didn't tell you. It's okay. Ah, come over here. [typing] Fuck! Who is she? [Dominic] There's a bit of totty for me. [pop ballad playing, muffled] [vehicle approaching] [whispering] What the fuck? [engine turns off] You just scared me. [laughs] What are you doing hanging out outside? [chuckles] I see you weren't expecting me. He just looked at me. Did he just fucking look at me? [Sebastian] You okay? Yeah. Your dad just asked me to check on you, so... That's not my fault. Oh, now we're blaming our sister? You know me. I know. Can I show you something? - Yeah. - Okay. I'll fucking rub you, you fuckin' cunt! We need to figure this shit out, man. Natalie, what's going on? Where did you get this? I found it under the floorboards. I think my sister found some money too. I was doing some research, and I found this. "Was arrested for a string of robberies that terrorized the city and sentenced to 15 years, maximum federal penitentiary." None of the money was ever recovered. Okay, okay. We don't know it's his. Let's not jump to any conclusions. This money has been here for a long time. We don't know any of that. We don't know anything. Put it back. Just put it back. - Have you told anyone else? - No. Good. Have you spent any of it? Seriously? I mean, what are we gonna do? Mom and Dad aren't even here right now. And she's downstairs acting like a crazy... - Calm. Nat... Natalie. - ...wild child! It's not against the law to find money. Okay? We're gonna figure this out. Not a problem. Just put it back. Let's go talk to Jen. - It's gonna be okay. - Okay. [pills rattling] What the fuck are you doing? Fueling the fire. Fueling my calm. See, this is the calm before the storm. And it's gonna be a big fucking storm. Oh. [exhales] [groans] You gotta be fucking kidding me. Johnny wanted us to bring this guy? Are you gonna keep it together? - Rip off your beard! - Get the fuck off me, bro. - Chill the fuck out. - You'll be okay. [chuckles] Bro, are you gonna be the fuck all right? We got shit to do, and you gotta have your fucking brain together, man. [clears throat] [exhales] Let's fucking do it. Let's fucking do it. Let's go. Let's go, let's go. It's time to play. Can we fucking play? Please. Hey! Where's Jen? What's your problem? Where's my sister? I don't know. I think they went to her room. I'll get her. I'll check the back. [pop music playing] [knocking on door] Jen. I need to talk to you. I'm kinda busy. It's important. - Can it wait? - No. Fine. What is it? [whispers] I found something in my room. Congratulations. You found something in your room. I'm so proud of you. Now get the fuck out my room. Where were we? Let's see what everyone else is doing. But, Jen... There's more important things going on right now. - Like what? - Put your clothes on. Look, Jen, just 30 minutes. [chuckles] Like you can last that long. Why not? There's nothing going on downstairs. I have stuff to do. Get dressed! - Are you serious? - Yes. And your boxers? Fireworks, dude? Are you, like, 12? But... But I love you! [line ringing] Pick up. [sighs] This is Captain James Baker. Please leave a message. Dad. Call me. I need to talk to you. It's important. [engine starts] Fuck it. It's time. Finally. Come on. [Dominic] Hey. Look at me. [sniffs] Look at me. Have I ever let you down? Pills or no pills? No. [Dominic] ...problem. What are you worried about? Lighten up. Have a bit of fun. [claps] For my brother, man. You gotta take it cool. Brother, shmother. Let's just fucking have a bit of a laugh, eh? Fuck it. [exhales] [Dyana moaning] Hey, y'all. I'm here for the ménage à trois! [laughs] [grunts] Stop! [grunting] [teen] What? Who the fuck? - Who the fuck are you? - Shut the fuck up! What? Run! - No! - Run! No! - [teen] Run! - [Dyana] No! No! [whimpering] Another one hits the dust. - [grunts] - No! [teen] No! You're a sick fuck, you know that? No! [retching] Really? Aren't you gonna tell me? He's playing hard to get. - So annoying. - I know. Where's Tom? He went outside to pee. - Why didn't he just use the bathroom? - Boys. He's been gone for a while now. Hey, hey. Party's over. Go home, go home. We need to talk. [exhales] [urinating] Hey. - Who the fuck are you? - I'm here for the party. You dirty bastard! [grunts] Fuck! Keep that in your pants next time! Fuck! Oh. Pretty thoughtful, a refreshment. Not bad, son. Not bad. Off to the party. Nobody fucking move! - Who the hell are... - Sebastian! - [gunshot] - [screaming] You psycho piece of shit! I'm gonna fucking kill you! Why did you do that? It helps. [screaming] You could've fucking shot me, man! [sobbing] Can't leave the ladies waiting. [crying] Matthew. Why don't you come over here and help me clean this shit up? [cell phone ringing] Could you answer that? That's Natalie. Okay. Hello? Dad! Dad, you have to come home. Hello? - Hello? - Dad! Dad! Hey, Nat, I can't hear you. I'll call you back - when I can get some reception. - Fuck! Fuck! Hello? - Try again. - No service. Daddy, Daddy. Hi, this is Lisa. You missed me. Leave me a message. Dad! Dad, you need to come home. There's some guys in the house. - Dad, please hurry! There's... - [door opens] Ah! The bedroom. There you are! [screaming] [screaming] - I'll be your daddy! - No, no, no! [Natalie] No! No! - [zipper opens] - [Dominic whooping] [James] Finally, some reception. [Natalie] Dad! Dad, you need to come home. There's some guys in the house. [crying] Dad, please hurry! There's... [James] I see them. [Dominic] There you are! [Natalie screams] [James] It was my mistake. What's wrong? Leather. The smell. You're here. What happened, James? Babe. [Natalie] Dad! Dad, you need to come home. There's some guys in the house. Dad, please hurry! There's... - This is real? - Yeah. You can hear this? Yeah, yeah, yeah. What... Okay... - [screaming] - What... - Call Sebastian! - I'm calling Sebastian. He's not answering. We gotta turn back. Stop the car and let me drive. [Lisa] We need to call the cops! [James] Cops get hostages killed. Get in. We got a fucking problem. This doesn't look like a problem. Yeah, it's a fucking problem. Because we don't have Johnny's ring. Who gives a shit about a ring when you got all this money? It's his fucking dead wife's ring. She died when he was overseas. And we're a hundred grand short. I'll find the money, you find the ring. - Yeah. - Come on. [Rudy] It's the only fucking thing he has left of her. [whimpering] Where's the money? You live here, right? Tell me where the money is. I swear, I only took a few hundred. No, no, there's more than a few hundred missing. All right, listen. I don't wanna hurt you, okay? I don't. But my brother and Dominic won't think twice about puttin' a fucking bullet in your head. They're upstairs right now doing God knows what with your fucking sister. One more chance. Where's the money? [muttering] [grunts] [Matthew] Get the fuck off! [grunts] [grunting] [gunshot] [grunts] [line ringing] [phone ringing] Hey. Hey, Johnny. [clears throat] It's Matthew, man. He's, uh... He got fucked up, bro. [Johnny] What? Holy shit. [cheering, shouting] [glass breaking] What are you fucking smirking at, you fucking scrawny prick? [shouting, cheering] Your sister's a fucking fat cow. All right. Let's go, motherfucker. Come on. [both grunting] [laughs] Ray. Come on now, Ray! Who's a faggot right now, you skinny prick? [both grunting] [laughs] [cheering continues] Come on. Hit that fucking fat bastard! Come on. Lay that motherfucker out! [motorcycle revving] Fuck! Are you fucking kidding me? I know. It's been a little bit too long. I know. Come here! Hey, brother. You always knew how to make an entrance. Oh, shit, wow. It's good to see ya. What's going on over here? Remember my little brother Ray? He ain't so little anymore. [crowd cheering] Come on! Hey, Ray. [whistles] Hey, Ray! Ray. - Remember me? - What's up, amigo? Hey, you ain't skinny little Ray no more! - Look at your ass, man. - How you been? Wow. You been taking care of your little brother? Oh, yeah. He's doing good, man. - Still fightin' every day, huh? - I'm tryin'. Fuckin'-A. Gotta do something for a living. So, listen, you ain't exactly supposed to be here. You just got out. This is the last place you should be. Yeah. Oh, shit, you know. Shit went sideways. Matthew got killed. Matthew? Your brother Matthew? When? [shouts] Who killed Matthew? Let's go. We got some business to take care of. Come on, come on. [motorcycle engine revving] [whimpering] - [Sebastian groaning] - [knife slashing] [crying] [groans] [Jen crying] [knife clatters] [cell phone ringing] [Johnny] Is this Daddy? Who the fuck is this? I swear to God, man, you put one hand on my daughters, I will fucking make sure you die. Well, it's a little too late for that. Here's the deal. You walk away right now, and I won't kill you. Well, like I said, you're just gonna have to kill me then, boy. You got something that belongs to me. [phone clatters] [crying] [gasping] Baby, don't worry. I'll get our daughters, and I'll make this motherfucker pay. Are you sure it's not gonna... No. I'm built for this. It's civilian life I'm not used to. - Okay. - You still have the gun in the house? I got rid of it. Shit. Fuck. Don't worry. I'll get this motherfucker. [car engine revving] Shit! Get the fuck in here! - Where is it? - [grunts] Enough with the games, sweetheart. Give it up. Today! Come on. Let's go. Come on. Get the fuck out! Move! Okay, babe. I'm gonna go in from here. - You stay outta sight, okay? - Okay, babe. Be safe. [car door closes] Did you see that? I don't see shit. I'm gonna check it out. Hey, what's going on back there? [grunting] [gunshot] [grunting] [gunshot] I think I'm gonna go outside and check on the boys. Well, I hope you're fucking quick about it. [cell phone chimes] [grunts] [neck snaps] [body drops] Shit. Shit, shit, shit. All right, let's find the rest of it. [cell phone ringing] Yeah? You're kiddin' me. All right, I'll be right there. Shit. [Jen] Dad! [Jen sobbing] - Where's your sister? - She's upstairs with them. Okay. Where's Sebastian? They killed him. They stabbed him over and over. My friends! - How many are there? - Like five or six. Okay. Your mother's waiting in the car. I want you to run as fast as you can. [James] Go, now. [grunts] [gunshot] All right, they're here. Let's go. Let's kill 'em all. You got it. Get this shit and get out of here. [gun clicking] [laughs] Missed me, motherfucker! Oh, God! [body thuds] [doorknob clicking] [grunting] Oh, shit! [gunshot] [biker] Motherfucker! Move the fuck... Come on! Fuckin' bitch! Are you fuckin' kidding me? Don't fucking move! Gun down! I said put the fucking gun down! [Natalie sobbing] It'd be a real shame to put a hole in her pretty little face, wouldn't it? [screaming] [Natalie sobbing] You killed my fucking brother. Know what the difference is between you and me? - I got nothin' to... - [gunshot] [loud sobbing] It's okay. It's okay. Okay. Sweetie, sweetie. Listen. Listen. I'm gonna need you to be strong, okay? Now, your mother's downstairs. I need you to go to her. - No. - Yes, and I want you to use this, if you need to, to get away. You can do it. - Dad, no. - Baby, baby, just go downstairs. You can do it. You can do it. - Okay? - Okay. Are you ready? Okay. Go to your mom, all right? Go on. You can do it. Go ahead, baby. All right. Hey, Johnny! It's James. It's just you and me now. Are you listening to me? Let's make a deal. I know what you want. I'm comin' in. Don't shoot. Drop that shit. [gun thuds] Don't worry. Some things bullets won't satisfy. Hey, we could make a plan. [growls] All right, motherfucker. This is for my wife and my daughters... and Sebastian! You gotta go. [sheriff] I wouldn't do that. Shoot him. Goddamn it, motherfucker, shoot him! You work for me. Shoot him! I don't think you're getting it, Johnny. I think that silencer says he works for himself. Ain't that right? That's not a department-issue gun, is it? And that's your money he's got right there in that bag, Johnny. Am I right? With everybody dead, you get all the money. All you gotta do is kill one more. But if you kill me, there's gonna be an investigation. But if you take out poor Johnny here, well, the good guys win. "Local sheriff and DEA agent take out criminal home invaders." All we gotta do is figure out how to split up the money. The money that nobody but you and me knows about. You piece of shit, I'll kill you! [gunshots] Now, let's talk about that deal. - Sheriff. - [groans] I see you found our gun. Among other things. [sirens wailing] [sirens continue wailing]
