- Fight! - Okay, here we go! Todo! Picture yourself flapping your wings. Go! - Haruka! - Haruka, go for it! - You can do it! - Fight! It's the champion's routine. Haruka! Haruka, you can do it! Haruka, concentrate! There she goes! Clear. - Todo, well done! - Haruka! - You're the best! - Go, Murakami! Murakami, follow Todo! You can jump too! - Michiru! You can do it! - Jump! You can definitely jump! Michiru, fight! - Here I go. - Michiru, you can definitely jump! - Ah... So close. - So close. I thought she cleared it. But they're really amazing. Haruka and Michiru. I'm leaving. Congratulations. Ms. Todo, with this record, you'll be unbeatable in the championships, no, even in the Olympics. That's not really my goal. Oh, you look like you're in good condition. Conditions can be controlled. I think that's a skill too. Congratulations, Haruka. Here you go. Good job. You did great. With a record like this, there's no doubt you'll be an Olympic qualifier. You've done well. Thank you. I'm looking forward to hearing from JAAF. For now, get some rest. Okay? Yes, sir. Thank you for your hard work. - Good work. - Good work. Oh right, Todo. Why don't you and Murakami start a joint training program tomorrow? I want you to share your program with Murakami. No, thank you. Michiru can't jump because she's weak. She's weak because she's not trying hard enough. I'm leaving, please excuse me. Undefeated for two years. She's truly a champion. So she's aiming for an Olympic medal. But I don't like that kind of thing. I think it's a very good translation. It was translated well, the nuances of the original are well expressed. I can feel the ingenuity. I love it. Thank you very much. - Oh, right, Mrs. Todo. - Yes? Would you like to have dinner with me for our meeting hereafter? Go ahead. I'm sorry. [ It's starting to rain. Can you come get me? ] [ I'm sorry. I'm still in a meeting ] Running it is then. With a record like this, there's no doubt you'll be an Olympic qualifier. Olympics... [ Flight on the Water ] [ English subtitle brought to you by ECOTV ] Haruka! Haruka? How can I help you? I'm sorry. I think she regained consciousness. Please come here. I'm on my way. [ Haruka Todo ] [ No sensation in her feet and lower body ] Yes, come in. Ms. Todo. As I thought, your legs won't move anymore. So we're going to start rehabilitation on how to use your body and build up your muscles to live in a wheelchair. I know it's terrible to say these things to someone so young. But it's precisely because you're young that I want you to think about your future life. A little at a time is fine. Start with what you can... Haruka, breakfast. Yes. - This is Michiru Murakami. - Yes. How did you feel when you set the record at 185 centimeters? Yes, umm... To be honest, I was surprised. I didn't think I'd be able to jump in the first try, so I felt like I'd been set free and calmed down. But I was very happy that I won. Here I go! Oh, she did great. I'm so proud of her. Everyone's been paying attention to me, and I've been... Haruka, we're having breakfast. Turn off the TV. Murakami is a very competitive person, and her concentration prior to the meet was remarkable, from a distance. If she keeps this up, I'm sure her record will improve even more, so I have high hopes for her. Hey, you know that I don't eat that many carbohydrates. This wasn't the result of all my efforts, but... Michiru still hasn't gotten over her habit of stepping on it. Come on, Haruka. You have to eat. I really want to become a perfect athlete and compete in meets. - Yes, thank you. - Thank you very much. That was Michiru Murakami, a member of Japan's national high jump team. Thank you very much. Make sure you drain the water before wiping. If we don't hurry, it's gonna be dark soon. [ Ikuko Todo ] Yes. Hello? Yes, it's so good! This konnyaku really soaks in. The meals are well balanced. That's Ikuko for you. Thank you very much. Mr. Miyamoto, do you have a lot of free time to manage sports facilities? "Free time?" What the hell? I'm busy. I still teach canoeing. I've recently started a bridge school for children, and it's quite popular. Bridge school? Yeah, it's a school that teaches the importance of learning through various experiences. What do you think? Sounds fun, right? Not really. So if you're so busy, what brings you here? Yeah, well, it's just... I was in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd drop by. I don't need any of that. I'm fine. Yeah. Yeah. Say, it's been a while since I've seen you in a canoe. You haven't come at all since you started track, have you? You know, all these little kids, jumping and splashing around, it's a hoot. I canoed when I was in elementary. Besides, I can't do anything on my own right now. I can't even handle a child, let alone a canoe. Yeah, well, that's fine. For now, why not come visit us once, okay? More than that, you haven't eaten at all. Come on eat. It's good. I don't want to add any extra weight, cause then I won't be able to jump. Just kidding. It can't be helped. I have a spinal cord injury. That means I can't move my lower half. Haruka... I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. If only your mother had picked you up back then... none of this would have happened. There's nothing I can do but apologize. That's why enough of that, okay? But I also feel bad for your father... I was dreaming of you at the Olympics, too. Hey, Haruka. Just a change of pace. Don't think too much. Just come and play. Okay? [ "I can't walk for the rest of my life," a woman with spinal cord injury restores her mobility through walking training. The miracle of never giving up ] One, two, three, four... Face straight ahead. Hey, is that it over there? Let's go. Wait a second. Yes, yes, one, two, three... Ah, Haruka! Haruka! Haruka... everyone gather around, come on. Haruka! Haruka! Haruka! Haruka, Haruka, Haruka...! - Hello. - Haruka! Hey, you're here! Hey, guys, come here, come here. Okay. How about a greeting? - Hello. - Hello. Today's visitor is Ms. Haruka Todo and her mother, Mrs. Ikuko. Is one of them your mistress, Coach? Yes, actually, they're both my mistresses... You idiot! What are you saying? She's my student. That's why she's with you guys. - What? - That's not possible. What do you mean, it's not possible? Ah, Haruka. Well? Brings back memories, don't it? No, not really. Wanna ride it? For old times' sake. It feels great. It's exhilarating. I told you it's impossible. I would drown. Yeah, yeah. You could drown. Maybe I'll put out a cushion. Okay, hold on. Mrs. Ikuko, can you help me? Yes. Haruka, I'm letting go of my hand. - Let's carry it. - Yeah. - Just a sec. I'm gonna go park the car. - Okay. One, two... Guys, when we reach the next bridge, we'll take a break. - Yes... - Yes. Can I make a run for it? You can, but make sure you don't sink. Okay. - Guys, you're spreading too far. - Okay. Takuto, Takuto, more to your right.. Hey, can I touch your wheelchair? Yes. This type isn't for you. The seat isn't wide enough, and your arms are too thin. I think you should go for a more maneuverable model. You know a lot, don't you? - Tatsuya. - Thank you. Are you not gonna canoe? I can't use my legs. Are you injured? Something like that. But you'll be fine in the canoe. She can't. She's scared. She'll cry. Because she's a woman. Tatsuya. Hey, who are you talking to there? So you're in? I'm in. Obviously. - All right, Kimoto, you got it? - Yes, it's all good. Okay, let's go. Take the paddle. Okay, we're letting go. Slowly. Oh! Wow. Good balance! You sure got some experience. - Miss, you're good. - I'm just floating. - Even that's difficult. - Right? - All right, we're going in. - Yes... I'll give you a little push. Feels good, doesn't it? See? Your legs are fine, even if you're injured. - See you later. - Be careful, okay? - Be careful. - See you later. All right, let's go. Be the wind on the river, Haruka. Okay, we're going to the bottom of the Skytree. What? Skytree? What? It's only 30 minutes from here. 30... I don't think I can hold that long. You'll get used to it, you'll want to pedal again, you've done it before, and I know you. Good, yes, right and left. All right, then... right, left. - Tatsuya! - Huh? Let me take a pic. Okay. - Hey, Rina. Fishes. - Yes? - You're right - Hey, hey! - What? - Take mine, too. Sure. - Okay. - Thank you. Hey, Rina, did you get the picture? When I'm canoeing, I'm just like everyone else. - Hey, Rina! - Yes? - Take a picture of us, too. - Okay. Hey! - Okay. I'll show it to you later. - Yay. She's fast. Hey, hey... stop it, Haruka! Don't be rash. Hey, Haruka! Hey, guys, watch my boat. - Azuru, come here. - What? Is this yours? Yes. It stinks. Hey, shut up. I washed that. That's... that's a man's honor. Haruka. Haruka, you haven't changed at all. I'm quite relieved. I don't like it when people run in front of me. Right? Hey, don't you ever get a driver's license. Everybody gets flipped over. Or sink. But they get back up and ride it. That's what's so interesting. These are the ones who refuse to go to school, or neglected by their parents, or have all sorts of problems that they can't handle on their own. Come visit anytime. I think the kids like you. Well, when I feel like it. You're as cynical as ever. Sorry. I'll be right back. Is this it? Thank you very much. Here. Excuse me... Yes? Can you take that one, too? Here. Thank you very much. What is it? That wheelchair... What? No... bye. - This, please. - Let me get that for you. Haruka, I'm sorry. Did you find the books? Yes. - Okay. Careful with that. - Yes... Hello. - Ah, Haruka! - She's here again. Hey, Haruka, what's up? Getting interested in canoeing, are we? I lost the other day to a normal person. I think the angle of my stroke was too soft. "Stroke." Did you look that up? I don't like losing. She hasn't changed a bit, has she? Oh, you guys don't know that. Paddle like this... Vertically... Oh... That's more like it! Haruka! - Amazing. - Amazing, isn't it? Okay, good. Now come back here at once. Straight ahead... Hey, Haruka! Where are you going? To Skytree! You... idiot! Don't go alone! - Come on, we're going after her. - Yeah. One, two... Straight ahead... I'm not going here. But a sports college is no longer... It's like running away. I don't want to quit. Haruka, there's still time. Haruka, you're smart enough to know there's another way. - Leave me alone! I can make the decision myself. Michiru, you can jump it! Murakami, be thorough! You can do it! - Michiru! - Michiru! - Michiru, you can do it! - Michiru, you can jump it! - Michiru, you can jump it! - Michiru, believe in yourself! - Michiru, you can do it. - Michiru, set a new record! Here I go! - Coach Muranishi. - Yes? Mr. Shirakawa wants to see you. - All right, let's take a break. - Okay. - Okay, got it. - Yes. You know, she seems a little down today. Yeah, I guess. - Okay, let's get you out. - Yes. - Sorry for the wait. - Huh? - Oh, you brought it? - Yes. Oh, that girl... Hey, Haruka, look. Sota's brother brought it over. Sota's brother? Hello. What? What? You two know each other? No. No. He was an old student of mine, but he quit before you got here. Right? Okay, Haruka. Get on it. No, wait a minute. - Huh? - Why? That's a racing canoe. It's really fast. You said you wanted to get faster. What... What does that mean? Haruka, canoeing is a Paralympic sport. Why don't you try it? Paracanoe. Is this what you wanted from the start? No, not from the start. I've been watching you get better and better, and I began to think so. Haruka... This is your new goal. A challenge. Challenge. Isn't that exciting? You train, you compete with the best in the world, isn't that great? I'll do everything I can to support you. Let's aim for the Paralympics together! Okay? So come on. Get on it. Haruka? What's wrong with you all... You gotta be kidding me. Don't mock me. I'm not stupid! Not stupid! Not stupid! It's not that convenient! It's not that simple! Just because I can't do high jump, just because I can't run track, doesn't mean you can conveniently insist on canoeing! I just wanted to fly. I wanted to compete in the Olympics in high jump! That's why I worked so hard. I barely made it to the starting line. What the hell? Are you kidding me? - I understand... - You don't! How could you possibly understand? Because you never lose the use of your legs! Get me off this thing! Get me off! - Don't touch me! - Haruka! Haruka... Shut up! - Haruka! - Hey! Hey, let me ask you something. Why were you practicing canoeing? You've been reading, studying, and practicing canoeing, right? Because you had fun, didn't you? I don't understand how you feel, but if you enjoy it, why not keep doing it? Haruka! Haruka, are you okay? Let's just go. All good. Haruka, I have to go to work. You have to eat. Call me if you need anything. I'm off. Haruka! Haruka, you can do it! - Haruka, concentrate! - Fight! - Haruka, fight! - Haruka, you can jump! - You can do it! - Haruka, jump! Hello. Haruka? Haruka! - Haruka, what's wrong? Are you okay? - Haruka? Hey, what's up? Haruka fell down. What? Is she okay? It's just a scratch, though. What? Oh, and her wheelchair seems to be broken. Oh, hey, what do we do? All right, hold on a second. Yes, okay. You don't have to worry. Sota's brother can fix anything. Haruka, what were you doing back there? Oh, right... you forgot this. Haruka, you haven't been coming at all, so I came to give it to you. Haruka, are your legs going to heal? I was in a car accident. It's not gonna work anymore. Oh, I'm sorry. It's okay. I'm glad you asked so bluntly. But you know, my legs aren't the only thing I lost. I'll get you a spare wheelchair. Just wait here. - Tatsuya, give me a hand. - Ah, yeah. - I'm starving. - All right, hold on. Sota's brother, he's very skilled. Some people even ask for him by name. I think you should get a lighter model. You need to at least match the width of your seat. This doesn't hold you properly. Tatsuya said the same thing to me. - Yep. - Seriously? Well, I don't care what wheelchair it is, as long as I can ride and run with it. Haruka. You know, you can't say that in here. Who you calling "you"? What? Wait, wait... Hey! What are you doing? Too loud. You're hurting my ears. Shut up. Go on and try it. It's so light. Right? Did you make all these tools for these people too? Not tools, but orthotic equipment. - Orthotic equipment. - Yes. We're prosthetists and orthotists. Not all in that picture, but I was involved. In the Olympics, it's easy for the athlete with the best physique or talent to win. But not the Paralympics. What's important is the performance of the equipment and its affinity to the athlete. Choosing one that fits your body and then you develop it from scratch, it's complicated, but that's what makes it interesting. So the equipment is part of your body. You can't just pick anything. Well, I guess so. I can't move my body anymore without someone's help. So you didn't get any help from anyone before you got into the wheelchair? Isn't it just a change in method? You have no idea what it's like to lose your place in the world. But I do. I've never had that from the start. Well, you're still alive, so why not make another one? Something important, a place you belong. Well, I guess I'm not that persuasive. Hey, Haruka. Are you not gonna come canoeing with us anymore? I think it'd be cool if you could compete in the Paralympics in canoeing. Yes. And I think you look really cool in a canoe. A car stopped. - Maybe it's Coach Miyamoto. - You think so? Hey, wait for me. Is this the same wheelchair as that person? Yes, it was his wheelchair. What kind of an athlete is he? Yeah, a basketball player. And he was my best friend. And now? Yeah. It's so heavy. Well, you can't compare them. How expensive is it to get something like this? Well, it's quite reasonable. Yes, of course. It's totally different. Haruka! Haruka, are you okay? Are you hurt? Are you not hurt? Yeah, I'm fine. All right, listen up. Forest camp starts today. This is only a training camp, so don't get carried away and start fooling around. Yes, sir. - Listen to your coach, okay? - Yes. Hey, you guys really understand, huh? - All you've been saying is "yes". - Yes. You said "yes" again. We're here. Ah, it's surprisingly cool. - All right, everyone, let's go. - Here, Haruka. - I'm glad you came with us. - Yeah. You have to get a part-time job to pay for that new wheelchair. I don't know why you're here. I'm here as a part-time tech support guy. [ Ikuko Todo ] [ Call me if anything happens. Have a safe trip. ] Don't look. Coach Miyamoto! Someone here grew up overprotected. S-Shut up. Gross. Shut up. What are you, in grade school? Release the brake. Leave me alone. I can do it myself. - No. - Huh? Why? You're going too fast. - If you're gonna push, push slowly. - Oh, just shut it. It's rattling. Be careful. Try not to go too far. - Within shouting distance, okay? - Okay! Wait. I'm spinning. Hey, watch the waves. Guys, guys, there might be swans. Swans. Really? Oh, you can cook? I can't do much. But they're thinly sliced. Some of the kids don't like onions, so I thought I'd cut them thin. I'll help. What? - Here. - Yay! Thank you. - Thank you. - Let's eat. - Mr. Miyamoto, you want some? - Yeah. - It's delicious. - Tasty! - Can you taste the onions? - What? There's onions? - There are. - I barely noticed it at all. - It's so good. - The macaroni is so good. So, which do you like, meat or fish? - Meat? - Yes... - Fish? - Yes. Haruka, Tatsuya doesn't like eggplant. What? You don't like eggplant? You should eat them. Okay, make sure you hang up your futon. Okay. We've got an early day tomorrow, so get some sleep. - Yes... - Good night. - There. - There. Cute guy? You know, sometimes they want to protect you. Oh, something like that. - How about you, Ayaka? - Someone with a great smile. I get it. Shh! Keep your voice down. It's hot! Here. Thanks. Hey. That photo in your workshop... that guy in the wheelchair... Huh? Is he not here anymore maybe? Why? Only wheelchair is there... Yeah, he's long gone. Almost two years now. He was sick. But he hung on until the very end. I see. Yes. About canoeing... Yes. I really enjoyed it. Yes. But... I'm not really into canoeing... Going for the Paralympics... seems too soon for me. Too soon? Yes. If I'm going canoeing... it has to be definitive. I don't want to give up anymore. No, I mean, I fully understand, but all of it... I loved it. High jump. I loved high jumping. It was my everything. But I really have to give up now. I'm never gonna fly again. Well done for saying that. - Here. - Thanks. - Rina. - Yes? Thanks. So beautiful. It looks like she's flying. Yeah, she's flying. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Mr. Miyamoto, good morning. - Yes, good morning. Listen... Does it cost money to compete in the Paralympics? Hmm? Well, of course, you need to go on tour, and, you know, you need a seat made from scratch to fit your body. Well, then I guess I'll have to find a part-time job. Haruka, are you... You better take responsibility for taking me on, Coach. Righteous! Leave it to me, okay? No, "righteous!". Outdated? Righteous is outdated. - Okay, canoeing. Okay, let's do this. - Please. What? No, nothing. Are you sure you're gonna be okay by yourself today? Yeah, I'm good. Okay. - Hey, Mom. - Yes? Listen, I'm not quitting the university after all. But... I'm thinking of studying to become a junior sports instructor. I think there are things I can teach, and I want to stay involved in sports. I see. That was delicious. Okay. I'm off. Thank you very much. For a paracanoe like yours, Ms. Haruka, it's especially important to strengthen your biceps. So let's start with some exercise to strengthen it. - Okay. - Okay, in here. One, two, three. One, two, three... One, two, three. All right, first you need to get used to this. Try rowing. Okay. - Okay. I'll take that. - Okay. - How is it, Haruka? How does it feel? - I can't. - Feels good, doesn't it? - Impossible. Now, let's get down to business. It's harder to fall when you're rowing. Okay. Listen. - No, no, no, no, no, no! - Okay, time to take the hands off. Balance. Balance. Haruka. Good. Good. Okay, try paddling a little deeper. Yeah, there. How about that? Good, good. Good, good. Just a little bit more. Good. Well done, Haruka. I'm so happy. Okay, okay, thank you. Are you good? Is Sota still at his workshop today? Huh? Yeah, I think so. Sota is so kind, isn't he? But he's hard on himself. Yes. That guy... His parents divorced when he was in the third grade. Apparently, both of them refused to take Sota in. So he was raised by his grandma and grandpa. That guy, by being so hard on himself, wants to prove that his existence is worth something. They're all the same. Living in fear all their lives, looking for a place to belong. For such a little thing. I wanted to create that place for these kids. So I started a bridge school with my friends. Well, now it's the opposite. Their smiles are helping me. Oh, he's here. Hey! Over here. Over here. I know. Just bring it here. A specialized seat. It's just a temporary fitting today, so we'll make some adjustments. Yes. Takuto, don't touch it. Don't push it. Try falling forward. Okay. How is it, Haruka? It's perfect. Doesn't wobble at all. It's fully custom-made. Thank you. Go ahead, try it. - Here. - Thanks. Okay, Haruka, here we go. Ready, go! - Haruka, you can do it! Fight! - Fight! Haruka, not bad! - Go for it! - You can do it! Good, good, balance both sides. Balance. Eyes front, eyes front. Come on, you guys, cheer up. - Go for it! - Fight! - Go for it! - Almost there. - You can do it! - Good. - You can do it! - You can do it! Paralympic Support Center. It's this girl. Please take a look at her. So... what does she have to do to get into the Paralympics? Let's see, assuming she's an L2, what's her time? At the moment, her best time for 200 meters is 1 minute 36 seconds. If so, let's have her in the selection race. First, she must try to clear the qualifying record at the Japanese championships in September. If she get a good time at the other preliminary qualifiers at Lake Fuchu in Shikoku... Shikoku. That's far away. We don't have the manpower or the budget to carry a canoe right now. Isn't there some kind of reinforcement fund? Well, I wish we could get everyone on board, but paracanoeing is still very small. Plus, we need actual results. Oh... oh, right. [ Course 6: Reika Asahina ] That's footage from last year's paracanoe championships. The one at the top is Reika Asahina. She's a leading figure in Japanese paracanoe. She's your rival, Haruka. Reika Asahina's 200m time is under 57 seconds. That's fast. Anyway, in order to qualify for the Paralympics, you need to clear your selection time in the upcoming race against her. In order to do that, it's imperative that we improve both your skills and your equipment. - Yes. - Yes! I'll try. - I'm counting on you. - Yes. Haruka, hang in there. Haruka, hang in there. Fight! Fight! So fast. What... So fast... Wow. So cool, Haruka. Wow! Yeah, yeah. Good work. Okay, I got you. It feels good. But I'd like to catch the water a bit more. All right, I'm gonna lower the angle a notch, see if that helps. As many times as it takes, we'll find the best one Yes, please. Okay, let's take a break. Okay. You okay? Hold it still. Here we go. Ready... All right, that's six millimeters higher, so it shouldn't fall forward. - Let's ride once and find out. - Okay. Ew, it feels gross. Ready? Go! - It's so pretty. - Oh, wow! I'll put mine on this side. Let's move it along. Come on. Hey, you got me. - Don't open your eyes. - Can I open them? - No! Not yet! - What? I'm scared... - You're looking, aren't you? - No, I'm not. I'm not. - Can I open them? - Not yet. Wait a sec. - Not yet, not yet. - Can I? Go ahead. [ Go all out! -Azuru Forward! Forward! Good luck! -Ayaka Don't lose -Takuto ] - Ready... - Haruka, good luck! Yay! Thank you. Go for it. Go for it. Okay, nice pace. - You're about to go a minute. Twenty-two. Bring it back slowly. Twenty-three. Like making a triangle. Great. Then let's aim for the 90 pitch. Miss, good luck! Thank you very much. Good luck! Bye-bye. Wow! Amazing. Bye-bye. Catch it from the front. That's right. - Haruka, go for it! - Haruka, you can do it! Nice. Nice. Haruka, just like that! Yeah, good. Nice pace. Nice pace. If you keep this up, you're gonna break the 50 seconds. - Keep going to the finish line. - Go for it! - Until the finish line. - Haruka, you're moving so fast! Go! Haruka, go! - Here. - Thank you. - Listen, Haruka. - Yes? Are you not afraid of sinking when no one's there? I'm afraid I won't be able to give my all, and I'd be more frustrated if I lost. I've never met someone like you before. What are you saying? Okay. Give me the towel. - It's done. - Wow, it's so cute. I'm so happy. - Really? Thank goodness. - Yes. A feather. - It's cute. - Really? [ Weights - Dumbbells Pullovers - Triceps ] She's sleeping out here. Hello? Here I go. Michiru, you can do it. - Hey. - What? I hear you're not doing so well. You can't jump under pressure. It's shameful and awful. I don't need you to tell me what to do. You're an outsider. I'm relieved that you still feel that way. This is who I am now. I can't walk anymore. I can't jump anymore. I thought I'd lost my life and my friends. But I was wrong. The only thing I lost was myself. They were all around me. Whether you're doing well or badly, in the end, it's all the same. You keep trying. You just have to believe in yourself and keep trying. How come you're so strong like that? I'm not strong. This is my last order. Michiru, defend the title of high jump champion. I will! I'll fly with you. Okay, you can come up. Haruka. It's time for the qualifiers. When you decide to do something, you go all out. I'm teaching you how to get back up. You've been like that since you were a kid. You look just like your old man. You've come a long way. Yes. [ The 10th Japan Paracanoe Championships ] Asahina, a word, please. Touto Sports. Can you give us a statement? Asahina, a word, please. Yeah, well, this past year I've been working on strengthening my paddling at the end of the race, so I'm hoping I can show that. I believe that in canoeing, it's not so much about time as it is about order, so I'm going to focus on making sure I get first place. Do you mind? Excuse me. Make way, please. - Thank you. - Thank you. Hey, Haruka, are you nervous? Huh? Not really. Don't worry. We've got your back. Tatsuya, that was rather cool of you. After all this time? Tatsuya, don't get carried away. Are you okay? Let's go. Ms. Todo, please tell us how you're feeling. I'll do my best. I'm a rookie. She changed somehow. Yeah. I like that. What? Haruka, be strong! - Haruka, good luck. - Haruka, fight! Start off the same as you always do, but start pressing the waters at the end. When they come out, don't be in a hurry to pitch up. - Yes. All you have to be aware of is how hard you're pulling under the water. - Yes. - Thank you. Reika, pick up the pitch. Don't get too shallow. - Yes. - Okay, let's go. Yes. Mr. Miyamoto, Sota.
