BASED ON AN ORIGINAL IDEA BY MAURICE CLAVEL Even during his lifetime, he was a legend. Even during his lifetime, his exploits were played out on the stage. Ah! Don Juan! My love, my life! I live for you. Ah, Don Juan! What are you saying? My husband! In the bridal room! No! Don't fight each other. Please! My husband. -What should I do? -Please. Don Juan, the gallant, the bold, the terrible, the irresistible Don Juan. However, he wasn't alone. There was always someone with him. Who? Me, the discreet, the obscure, the devoted, the faithful Sganarel. So I'm not eating then? No. We were going to Toledo. We were being followed by an army of fooled husbands, outraged fathers, worked up women, curious young girls. Each time my master sees a pretty girl, she could be a countess, marquise, bourgeoisie, princess, or waitress, he catches fire. He writes a thoughtful letter. He writes it, and I deliver it. If it doesn't arrive, it's not my fault. Get back inside. Scoundrel! Bandit! Scoundrel! On the sixth, Lerida. The admiral's niece. One day lost. She deserved more. On the eighth, Seville. The Countess. Two days of cooing. A throat like a turtledove. On the eleventh, Ramos. The twins. One day for each. They loved each other. I didn't want to get them mixed up. The 14th… The 14th? The 14th, rest. Oh that's right. Rest. It was Sunday. The 15th. The countess. Four days for the countess. One, two, three, four. Four days. The first three to have the last one. Nine days lost in total. Three days to rot in this hole under pretext that a beautiful girl will pass by. I sent a letter. She will come. If you had seen her, you would understand. I will never understand you. Wind, rain, cold, a rock for a pillow, stealing chickens to live, and all of this for what? A woman. For love. Love? Ha ha! Ah, let's talk about love. A secret door, toothless duennas. Hm! Memories from the war of the cuckold. Entire nights shivering under the balcony. This! This I know. But love? No. Don't disparage it. I disparage it because it drives you crazy. But look, master, the governor of Toledo has invited you, when the other governors are trying to have you hanged, to his daughter's wedding. And who are you watching for on this ridiculous rock? Of course, his daughter! Excuse me. Oh, father, will you have the heart to give me to this bearded man? Don't judge a book by its cover, my child. But this man is brutal and crass. He was thoughtful enough to give you his portrait. He has a good heart. Enough, little fool. A man marries out of reason. A girl marries out of obedience. Do you think your father and I… Come now. Leave us. Leave us! I would hate to force you, my child, but understand that this marriage is beneficial. For whom? Well for me, for the province. If not, Don Inigo will succeed me, and in that case, I pity my poor people. And big eaters are subject to apoplexy. What's better than a rich, young, and pretty widow? And Alataquerque is a hunting fanatic. You'll rarely see him. A wife left is charming to all the suitors. Don Ramon, if this marriage goes through, I'm ruined, and if I'm ruined, you're going down with me. Find something, search. Do something. Dishonor Donna Inez. I would do so gladly, but that is hard to come by. Truly. Don Juan himself was unable to woo her. Don Juan! Donna Inez found this in her missal. "Light of my heart, the mountain road can be our road to happiness. Give me a sign in passing, and a thousand soldiers couldn't keep us apart. Your far away lover, Don Juan." My mistress didn't dare respond. Firstly, can you take your mistress for the day somewhere you will not be seen? I can arrange it. Secondly, can you get for me Donna Inez's blue cape? Easily, but why? Don Juan. We'll kill two birds with one stone. Don Inigo! Don Inigo! What is this fight about? Is it not my job to help you maintain the King's order? How have these raucous artists disrupted His Majesty's order? These street performers are a menace to the city's moral health. They're performing the legend of Don Juan, sinful story exalting the vile man who deserves to be burned alive 100 times. Don Juan, burned alive? Don Inigo! Watch what you say! I'm still the governor of Toledo, and my daughter's marriage will consolidate my power. I invited Don Juan to this celebration, and if harm comes to him in my city, you will pay with your head! What is this? Throwing us in prison like this? -We must all protest! -Yes, we will protest. Sir, tell me, are we released? -We're performing Don Juan. -Too bad. You, come. Are you setting me free? I'm selling it to you. At what price? Very little: a role to play for a few hours. Put on this cape. And if I accept, will you let my friends go? It's a deal. Get in. Onward. Ah, I told you she would come. Yes, but how do you know she's coming for you? Wait, you'll see. How do you know she will signal? How do you know it's you she signaled to? Obviously, it's not me. Your sword, Don Juan. Don Juan! Eh? Don Juan? Don Juan… Don Juan? You recognized me? Your horse is so famous. Ah, my horse, yes, but… I would have recognized you anyways, on a donkey and in a mask. Your confidence, your courage. You risked your life to save mine, without knowing me. And me… Now that I know you, I would love to have a thousand lives, just to risk them for you, my lady. My lady? No man has ever spoken to me like that before. How? Like you just did. Oh… did that please you? My lady, one look from your eyes outshines all of the stars in the sky. Did you like that too? If you said the word, my lady, I would take on the King's army, alone and unarmed. Yes? And if I tell you now that I truly believe what I just told you, would that please you? I would love to believe it. I would love to… Oh, forgive me. No, forgive me. You don't understand. No, you don't understand… -I'm not… -I'm not… I'm not Donna Inez, and I'm not a famous woman. What? -I am… -Her attendant? Forgive me, Monseigneur. I should have told you long ago, but it pleased me so to be taken for a lady of the court for a moment, and to believe Don Juan loved me. You cannot understand. I understand much better than you could believe. Oh… -Leave me. -Why? Leave me, Don Juan, you're in danger. Soldiers are following my carriage. Soldiers? Oh, go. If they find you with me… But, when will I see you again? Never, Don Juan. Never! Go! …so the horse says, "yes, or no?" Oh, come on, it's priceless. Admit it! I've never heard such a thing. I'm glad you appreciate hunting stories! And I have dozens of others! When do we eat? Ah, Inigo! Monseigneur, bad news… Ah, I doubt it. You look very happy. Your daughter, Monseigneur, planned her own kidnapping. What are you saying? What? My fiancée? Thanks to me, the worst has been avoided, but the scandal is breaking. Watch what you're saying, Don Inigo. Your daughter, Monseigneur, had a rendez-vous! Well! The letters prove it. Madame… That's a vile lie! My soldiers witnessed it. They saw your lover. Monsieur, if you didn't have white hair, I would demand an explanation. Altaquerque, my friend, come now. You don't believe… It's villainy to believe like this without proof. I don't know what this conspiracy is, but tomorrow I'll summon you to the king. -I have the proof. -Impossible! Living proof. The man who dishonored your daughter. I told you, after the wedding. Your guest of honor, Don Juan! I have never seen this man! Cancel the feast. Who dared take my name? The entire city is saying some pathetic fool impersonated me. Who is this imposter? -Is it you? -Ah, no! -You? -Huh? You… not you. Forget it. If the imposter is noble, three inches of iron to the heart! And if he's a commoner, he'll be burned alive! Burned alive! Come here, Don Juan. Let me embrace you, my son. I must say, you barely resemble your father. Let's talk about that later. First let's sort out this affair. I want to know right this instant who allowed… Leave me alone. I never meant to take your name, Monseigneur, the soldiers grabbed me yelling, "Don Juan." -I didn't understand. -Neither did I. You'll pay dearly for this shameful ploy, Monsieur! How old was Don Juan when you saw him last? Eighteen months. And you claim to recognize him? I have his father's portrait! Of course. And you expect us to take this pathetic fool for a famous Spaniard? You can see the commonness in his eyes. And on this face, all of the nobility in the world! Ah, come, sit back down, Monseigneur… -Ah, no… -Yes, it was a misunderstanding. -No… -Oh, a terrible mistake, Monseigneur. -Sit down. -No. Sit down. Okay, I'm staying. But let's eat! Yes! Take this wretch away. One moment. What will you do to him? You promised him the pyre. The pyre, yes, but… I have a worse fate in store for him. I take him as my servant. There. Yes. Come on… This is the apartment I chose for you. The royal apartment! Royal, oh… Forgive him. He is so incompetent. Yes, the queen slept in this apartment. -If you must leave… -Oh we're not going out… See you soon. Master, how frightened I was. But you were magnificent. And thank God it's all over. It's all beginning. Ah, yes, we're leaving. No, we're staying. We… what? Inez believes I'm a servant. If I win her heart, it will be a triumph. Don Juan loved for himself! I told the Governor I'm leaving. You changed your mind. My shoes! -You want me dead. -No, I want Inez. Oh! Make me look good, Sganarel. I must have her at all costs. My child, your escort. Good. There! That's how we shine shoes. Did you understand, you ass? Yes. Your escort is waiting. I'm coming, Monseigneur. Eh? Ah, no, I thought about it. I'm staying. Oh… My son! I will throw a ball tonight in your honor. Okay! -This man is an imposter. -Prove it. I sent for a witness who will expose him tonight at the ball. I hope so! We'll add his head to my dower. Or yours! A question of… of taste. I'm not afraid, Monseigneur. Donna Elvire is galloping to us. Ah, tell me again, please. Again, Donna Elvire? I want his exact words, especially the parts about love. Don Juan said, "I can't live without Donna Elvire any longer." Oh, the dear lover! The night of our engagement, he disappeared and I've searched for him throughout all of Spain for years. Tonight, when I take him in my arms, he won't be able to escape me anymore. Napkin. It's fur! It's my beard, Madame. Ah, it's very lovely. Are you short-sighted? You guessed. I rarely wear these glasses. They make me look fat. Yes. You look great. It's been a long time since you've seen Don Juan. You might mistake him. I would know him with my eyes closed. I would still like you to wear your glasses. Be patient. Don Juan is arriving shortly. Sganarel! Sganarel? Sganarel! Yes? What are you doing under there? They're waiting downstairs. No, I'm not going. They will come looking for you. If they find me, of your thousand women there will certainly be one who will say I'm not you. They've never seen me. What? They loved a name, caressed a legend. The name, it's yours. Be a little legendary and it will go well. Legendary? Yes, that's easy to say. It's easy to do. Watch. Confidence, arrogance, insolence… elegance… Confidence, arrogance… insolence… elegance… hm? Don Juan Tenorio! Jesus, he is fine. Duchess of Ronda. Oh, it's too much. Archduchess of Montebello. I feel like I'm going to faint. Madame, put on your glasses. Find them for me. I'll never find them without my glasses. Donna Carmen of San Sebastian. -Enchanted to meet you. -Me too. Duchess of Medina. He's coming. Oh, it's too much! Your glasses! Baroness Esperanza of Evrondo. Madame, allow me to introduce my friend Don Juan. Ah! Oh, my heart is pounding! Madame! Well, Don Inigo, you arranged for all of the women to faint? Just one, Monseigneur. Make way. Quickly, a drink. Donna Elvire. Don't shake her like that. You'll wake her. Excuse me. That's better. My friend, it's very serious. But! It's very very serious. You heard him. Come on! Take her! We must run. What happened? Donna Elvire! What is it? She fainted. It won't last forever. Let's go. Pity, I beg you. I'm on my knees. I told you no. -On my knees! -No! Okay, what do you want? On my knees. Oh, well… Just a little glass of wine. Are you not here to serve, you rascal? That's right! Rascal, right? You rascal! Are you here to serve? And me too! And for everyone. And for everyone! Go on. Oh, okay… That's not how you serve. Here, like this. There, this is how you serve. It's easy. But, what are you doing? An example, Monseigneur, you must always give servants examples. Yes, well okay. To the health of our beloved host! Beloved? Beloved. To Don Juan! To Don Juan! But what are you doing Don Juan? An example, Monseigneur, another one. Another example… Monseigneur… An example, Don Inigo! Always an example. -So… -Example! Example? Example. Tell me, was it this man who took you? I know nothing, Monseigneur. And this one, the valet, have you seen him? I know nothing. Were there not two attacking the carriage? I know nothing, Monseigneur. To you, my son. -Me? -Yes. Take the most beautiful woman. -The most beautiful? -Yes. Listen, Monseigneur, not in public. No, start the ball! -Start the ball? -Well yes… We'll be up soon, Serania. Get ready. You. The actress? How shameful. How vulgar. What is it? Everyone is looking at us, and I'm not a noblewoman. And me, I'm not a nobleman. Oh, listen, dance with me. It's an order from the Governor. The Governor? Yes, he ordered me to choose the most beautiful woman. Come. -How disrespectful. -He has no tact. Don Juan, what an insult. -Monseigneur! -Yes? This scandal has gone on long enough! What scandal? Oh, the performer! Diplomacy, my friend. High diplomacy. Diplomacy? By choosing the actress, Don Juan avoids making any of our noblewomen jealous. Scandal is diplomacy? It's diplomacy. -What? -Diplomacy. What? Choosing this actress is diplomacy? -Want some? -No thank you. Ah, finally, something solid. This biscuit is very tender… OH, MY BEAUTY, IF AFTER THE BALL A ROPE LADDER HANGS FROM YOUR BALCONY, LOVE WILL COME. More than twenty times in 8 years cruel fate has separated us. But tonight, thank God, it has brought us back together. Your dress makes me look fat. It fits you perfectly, I think. Well, love is blind. -You as well, it seems. This way. -Excuse me. Ah, I'm going to have the first dance with my darling love. -Excuse me. -He is wearing all white. You can't miss him. Sganarel! What are you doing here? Lost, I'm lost! I'm lost too. I'm looking everywhere for Don Juan. Don Juan? He's in the garden, all the way at the end of the garden… -Ah… -Almost outside the garden. Oh, no, not that way. Turn your back to the music, and straight ahead to the frogs. Ah, the frogs. She is going to tip over the candles! My friend… Madame! Bring me some Málaga right away, for two. -Here? -Yes. Right away. Madame… I found the biscuit so tender. I will get you a plate. Tell me about this little cake. Oh, this little cake. Butter, flour, sugar, no eggs. Knead it well, let it rest for ten minutes and cook it in the over. Very very hot. We're alone. You can tell me everything. But I did, Madame. Did you choose that actress to stir up my vanity? But, your attendant… -My attendant? -Yes… What are you talking about? Serania is an actress, a simple actress. -Oh, she's… an actress? -Of course. What did he say during your dance? None of your business. What did he say to you? That I'm beautiful. Are you satisfied? My master, it's a trap. Serania lied to me. We're finished. What? She's an actress, and not at all Donna Inez's attendant. She was acting. -What? -She's an actress. It's a trap. I beg of you, let's leave while we still can. To us. To us. To you. Málaga. 1537! My love? Don Juan! At last, I see you! Oh, excuse me. Don Juan! Don Juan, where are you my love? -No one is leaving. -Don Juan is asking for his horse. Don Juan least of all. Don Juan! Where are you? Where are you? You were right. It's a trap. The exits are guarded. What will we do? Oh, that I don't know. She has her glasses! Where is he? My dress! -Please! -What is this! Don Juan, we want to understand something. I know nothing, Madame. Tell us… -What is the secret to your success? -The secret of your seduction? Oh, yes, tell us. Confidence, arrogance, insolence, elegance. There! Where is he? Do something! Please, Don Juan, can I ask you something? You too? Confidence, arrogance, insolence, elegance. There! What are you saying? I want to talk about this exquisite biscuit. This exquisite biscuit? Find a pastry chef! Where is he? What is going on? My witness has regained her sight! She can now determine the imposter! -Imposter? -Yes, imposter! Where is he? Don Juan! My fiancée! Tallyho! To the stable! Don Juan! Tallyho! Don Juan! Don Juan? Where are you? -Where is he? -Who? The imposter! -What imposter? -I will flay him myself! Tallyho! Tallyho! Charge! Ring the victory bells! Don't go, I want to tell you something. Useless. I fooled you without knowing what I was doing. The performance is over, Madame. For the last time, I beg of you, believe me. Don Juan! What are you doing here? I'm getting ready for my dance. You haven't seen… Don Juan! No. If you're lying to me, watch your back, clown. Why did you send him away? He threatened you, but you said nothing. Why? You know very well why. Me? Enough acting. A woman loves you, and you, Don Juan, are shocked. A woman loves me? It's not possible. You're making fun of me. Me, making fun of you? Ha! No one has ever said they loved you? Never. Leave. Not before explaining everything. Get out. Listen, I could say that I love you. You would never believe me. But I simply want to tell you that Don Juan and me, it's not the same thing. And you're not like they think? Exactly. I play a role. Yes, so go play elsewhere. If you love me, why are you chasing me away? Don Juan said he loved me a hundred times on the stage. A hundred times he lied. A hundred times he left me and never came back. I don't want to replay that scene with you. It isn't a role any longer. Can you promise me that the story won't end like it usually does? That Don Juan will never leave me? No. If you had lied to me, I would have been able to resist you. Listen, tonight I will sleep at the palace, and a rope ladder will hang from my balcony. Don Juan! Don Juan! I saw him. Here he is. I saw him! He was carrying a tray! A tray! That's what I thought! There he is! There! Come out, Don Juan! Don Inigo, have you lost something? Fainting again! Poor lady. I have a terrible effect on her! Come, let's drink to love. Here. Here you go. No! Here you are. Now, put the drowned lady to bed. To the dancefloor! Don Inigo, do you take me for a fool? Find your imposter, and fast! Your head is about to fall. Yours is about to get hot, Monseigneur. Don't worry about a thing, Monseigneur. Tonight, our men will be positioned in the halls. I saw you prowling around my woman. Don Felipe Sandoval! Monsieur, you owe me reparations. I'll wait for you at dawn at the Champ des Corbeaux. Okay… Hey, your glove. -Don Jorge de Clavijo! -Pleasure. An infamous seducer! You will bring me satisfaction. I have always brought everyone satisfaction. Tomorrow, at the Champ des Corbeaux. At dawn. Two left hands. In the name of our family! Siguenza family! Don Gonzalo! Don Nuno! Don Tirso! Don Sancho! Don Pedro! -Be there. -Tomorrow. -At dawn. -At the Champ des Corbeaux… Yes, okay, understood, tomorrow at dawn at the Champ des Corbeaux. Name and glove please. Don Juan Tenorio! Ah no, I am Don Juan. Excuse me. At last. Here, for you. But what is this? Gloves. It's time for this to end. Let's go, Sganarel. So you refused to leave a hundred times, and now… I wanted Inez to love me for who I am. Foolish. -Come on. We're leaving. -No. Impossible, my master. What is it? Look at me. You're in love? You? You believe in your character too much. You can't play it. You know nothing of love. It's you who knows nothing. I've only had 1,002 women. You don't love women. You collect them. If you had loved once, a single time… If I ever have to shine boots or serve drinks again, I will ask your advice. Come on. No. No! Twenty years I have been your barber, your cook, your step ladder, your doctor, your father, your mother, your mailman. Twenty years, and all I'm asking of you is one night. Poor fool, it's me she adores. -Fool? -Yes. She isn't waiting for a man. She's waiting for a legend. She's waiting for Don Juan. Not her. You don't think? I will tell her the truth. Then give me back my cape and take this coat. Go Sganarel. Someone's waiting. Go on. Climb the ladder. Then you'll know for whom they dropped it. Are you afraid? Afraid? No. I'll go myself. Forgive me, my master. Don Juan! Excuse me, I got the wrong ladder. Why are you running from me? Think of your fiancé. I wish I could forget him. This will be my lullaby every night. To shut him up, just whistle. Don Juan! I want my first time to be unforgettable. It will be, if it's with the one you love. And I love you, Don Juan! You think you love me, my girl? True love is something else completely. Have you had true love? Once. How do you recognize it? It depends on the person. A word, a look, a gesture. Believe me, Donna Inez, you can't get it wrong. Is that hers? What? This scarf, does it belong to the one you love? You have a rendez-vous? Go, Don Juan. Don't make her wait. Thank you. Above all, don't forget… Don't worry about me. I know. We've got him! What's that noise? I would like to know. Ah, stop this! I was trying to drown out your thunderous snoring! I heard perfectly! There is a man here. Of course, you and my father. There is a man here! You know very well what I mean. But who do you think would enter… my daughter's chambers? -Don Juan! -What? How dare you? Don Juan! Monsieur, that's enough, please! Oh, come on, Altaquerque, you've seen for yourself. Not the tiniest man in this room. Let's leave this child to her music. I told you, after the wedding. After the wedding. Serania? Ah, my darling. Donna Maria. My big boy. I've been waiting for you. No, listen, Madame, this is a mistake. A tragic mistake. Nobody understands you. Tell me everything. Everything! -I'll understand you. -No! -What was that? -Donna Maria's bedroom! Come out, Don Juan! Where is Don Juan? -What is he talking about? -I don't know. I was wondering. This bed didn't collapse on its own! It's an old bed. Yes, a very old bed. Something is amiss here! An old bed falling apart. What's more natural? What's more natural indeed! I've seen dozens of beds fall apart in my time. Don Juan! Leave me alone! This is ridiculous. It is such a calm night, you see? Guards! A brand new bed. Relax, Don Juan. They won't look for you here. Thank you. Not a sound! See, Don Inigo, everything is perfectly normal. I… Not a sound. Not a sound. In your daughter's room! My fiancée! Can I not play the harpsichord in peace? Don Juan is here! No! Altaquerque, it seems to me you are suspicious! He is here! Gentlemen, I won't tolerate this ridiculous charade any longer. Ridiculous and indecent. I don't know what to make of your attitude, but it certainly offends me. If Mr. Altaquerque is suspicious, let him search! My darling daughter, it's very late. And your bed is waiting for you. That's enough for tonight, I say! Insulting my daughter's honor! Goodnight, my child. -Good evening. -Goodnight. -Nothing more natural… -Enough! -Nothing more natural than… -Enough! I told you, after the wedding! Stop him! Guard! Come! This way! -Where? -No, in the other room! Here! Don Juan! Catch him! -Don Juan! -Oh, enough! You! Forgive me if I'm late, but… -It's fine. -It wasn't on purpose. Come! Here, find him! Tallyho! -Find Don Juan! -Find him! But why are your dogs chasing the valet? Everyone makes mistakes! It's only human. Don Juan is mine! Who would have guessed that I would tame you. Kiss me. Listen, I must tell you something. No, don't say anything. -No, not yet, I've had… -I know, you'll have many others. -Not one. -No, Don Juan, leave me my pride. Your pride? My only advantage over your other women is that you haven't lied to me. I wouldn't ask for anything more. You mustn't lie to me. Promise me. I promise. What's that noise? Where are we? Don Juan has arrived. My God. The men! Is it a matter of honor, Don Juan? Several. But there are too many of them, and you're all alone. Yes but, what else can I do? Nothing. I know, Don Juan never backs down. My first opponent! -It's me! -No, I'm the first! -No. -No, please, the first… -No! -No I'm first! -It's me. -No! -I know I was first! -Quiet! What did you say? That I was the first! Is that true? No! They're calling you a liar. -Who dares? -Not me, it's… -It's this gentleman. -I demand reparation immediately. Hear that? You owe him closure immediately. En garde, gentlemen. Careful. I'd love to know who's right. It was Don Felipe who was first. What is this? Enough! All those who are for this gentleman, over here. And all those for this gentleman, over here. Let's settle this fight right now. And me, sir? -Huh? You're by yourself? -Yes. Come. I'll find someone for you. -Touché! -Over here, sir! Right. Come with me. Excuse me, may I? Here's your man. Yes, that's it. There. Yes, good! They'll kill Don Juan. Who? If you want to save your friend, he's at the Champ des Corbeaux. At the Champ des Corbeaux… Our turn now. No, I'm not in a hurry… Our turn, I said. Okay, fine. I can't go on. Arrest him! Dismount, quickly. Turn yourself in, Don Juan, or she's dead. -Run, Don Juan! Run! -Turn yourself in, or I'll kill her. Accused of shamefully seducing, in a single night, 12 noblewomen, including two virgins. And of slaying 19 gentlemen by sword. Accused of betraying the Governor's trust, he is deposed today. Don Juan is condemned, by order of His Excellence Don Inigo, the new provincial Governor, to be burned alive on the pyre. Guard! Listen to me. -Someone. I need to speak to someone. -What is it? Let me out. I have a declaration to make. What do you have to say? Tell Don Inigo that I'm not… I'm not… What? Nothing. You came. Me? Would I have abandoned my love? It's Don Juan you love. I love you, Don Juan. And if I wasn't Don Juan? Nothing would have happened. You would be someone else. You wouldn't love me. I wouldn't love you. Your memory would be less cruel to my heart, less sweet. I alone remain in your heart? Forever, all alone, and alone forever. Okay, good news! I remain in her heart, alone… That's it? Love is enough for me. That never stopped anyone from roasting. Here. DON JUAN WILL BE BURNED ALIVE -Murderer! -Leave him alone! Don Juan! Enough! He is getting what he deserves. -Don't touch me! -No! Not Don Juan! Leave this woman alone! Thank you, Monseigneur. What does Don Juan's death matter to you? After all, the ladies don't have much good to say about him. To me he showed nothing but gentleness and tenderness. To you. What is your name? My name is Serania. I'm an actress. So you know Don Juan, and you love him? More than anything in the world. Fear not. I also love him. He will not die. I promise you. Tell me, what do you see in Don Juan? You couldn't understand. Okay. Fifty bundles of wood will finish him off. He's not very big. Enough of that. He won't give us trouble. Go on. He seems honest. Here, give him this for me, and make him eat. Skinny people burn slower and suffer more. Someone brought this for you. Who? Someone who's interested in you. Eat, my brave man. You will suffer less. -You think? -Oh yes. It's OK, it's but a bad moment to get through, you know. Yes, but after it's slow. You will forget me. Me, perhaps, but my wife… never! "Fear not. The executioner has been bribed." The executioner has been bribed! I'm saved! When the executioner lets him go, I'll give him my horse. Then we'll split, that'll confuse the guards. We'll meet up at the Champ des Corbeaux. Confess. Confess! I accepted a thousand ducats to let Don Juan go. Gentleman, I name you official executioner of the province, and you'll have a spectacular debut: the execution of Don Juan. Our new executioner is a real artist. You will be delighted. Thank you. Thank you. -This is terrible! -Don Juan! Don Juan, I love you! -I want to die, too! -Thanks! Don Juan! -I love you! -Don Juan! -The executioner! -What? They replaced him. Stop! Don't burn him! But that's not Don Juan! It's a mistake. Thank God, it's going to work out. That's not Don Juan. It's not him! No! Don't disrupt the show. Madame, it's very noble of you to want to save me. I thank you, but… But Don Juan would never sacrifice an imposter to save himself. This woman is telling the truth! She's telling the truth! I'm Don Juan! You're going to commit a crime! Thank you, unknown friend. But your kind gesture is useless. Gently. Forgive me if I'm a bit boorish. It's my first time. Me too. I hope everything goes well. Yes, but, it's not that easy. I'll do my best to help. -You're too kind, sir. -It's the least I can do. Is that too tight? No, but what should I do now? Nothing. I prepared everything. Even this. What's that? A tourniquet! It's not allowed, understand? But in just a minute there will be smoke, and believe me, there will be! Ah, because it's green wood. Yes, it smokes more. And then, in one move… Unseen, I'll strangle you! What? Well yes. You'll suffer less, and the people won't see us. Women of Toledo! You can't let him die! You're not going to let them kill a man whose only crime is loving too much! Oh, sisters! The thing Don Inigo wants to burn is love! Love, which makes us all equals! And that's why he fears it! And when your tears put out the fire… Oh! It will be too late! Stop this woman! Serania! Don Inigo! Who will save us? There. Tallyho! Must you really leave me? I'm afraid so. Professional obligations. Will I see you again? Next week. I'm going to Toledo next week. In fifteen days I will be back, before the end of the month. Don Juan, you promised not to lie. I'm not lying. I… Adieu, Serania. You cannot know how much I lament that I'm Don Juan. But that's how it is. There's nothing I can do. It can't be undone. And if you weren't Don Juan? If you were but a man, a simple man like the others? Sganarel.
