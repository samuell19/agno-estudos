"Fragment from Broken Streets," you should have called it. Everybody, this is Doc. Dr. Lasey from the book, the good doctor. How are you doing? -Oh, where's my picture? -(INAUDIBLE) Hello, Doc. -Hey, Angie. How are you? -I'm all right. Hey, are you proud of this guy yet or what? I'm very proud. Martin, can I have a word? Oh, yeah. Listen, I'm going to the Strand with the Beckers, -and then afterwards, I'm... -Okay. I'll meet you there. -No, you don't have to. -I know I don't have to. I want to. I came tonight to be supportive. Don't make this more difficult, please. Angie, we still live in the same house, right? So I figured this... Stop acting like there's nothing going on with us, because there is, and none of it is very good right now. -Good night, Doc. -See you, Angie. We better get going. Ricky wants to see you. I don't want to be late. Yeah. Yeah. Just give me 10 minutes. Let's see what's going on, Doc. But I don't want to keep Ricky waiting, Martin. -Do it quick. -Detroit, I love this city. -Hey, Mitch! -Hey, Doc, -you got an alibi for this? -Mitch, I'm innocent. I swear to Christ. -Mitch, what's up? -The sky, the moon... -What I know, I definitely ain't telling you. Well, that's damn creative, Mitch. I'll tell you what, I'll let you off for that, but I'll be back to bust your balls about it all night long. Martin, let the guy do his job, will you? Mitch... -Happy Halloween. -All right.

Rick, the neighborhood's a mess. I mean, some guy is stuffed in the trunk of a car outside of McCanne's. No. Really? What would I do without you, Doc? The doctor... You're the best, right? Newspaperman, did you get a look at who that dead guy was out there? No. I have no idea. Oh. His name was Artie Cerno. Ring a bell, huh? I just read that article you did on him the other day. I had no idea he knew so much about illegal gambling. Good story for you, obviously bad luck for him. Maybe before you win a Pulitzer, you could learn something. You like telling stories? That's nice. But the guy was an asshole, and you let him shoot his mouth, off and now he's dead. There are consequences here. That's all I'm saying. Rick, Martin never wrote a bad word about you. I got a fan club because of this guy. But that last story he wrote, Doc, was bullshit. It wasn't necessary for Artie to go off like that. I mean, is that okay with you, Doc? Is that okay? How about you, Martin? I need to hear it, a word of warning. I want to hear it. Let me hear it. Do you hear it? -I hear it. -Good. You got great talent, kid. You do. But so help me God, you better think before you write that shit next time, because I'll come looking for you, and I got real long arms, Martin, and you too. What did he say? Huh? I mean, what the fuck line did I cross? It was a nothing story. You know what I mean? He didn't have to... He didn't have to do it. I had nothing to do with what he said. Look, Martin, with all due respect, but Artie Cerno was an asshole who shit on Ricky for years. Ricky is doing this because he doesn't want you to turn on him. He killed him to shut you up. -So they killed him to shut me up? -That's right. No, no, no. I can't do it anymore. Fuck it. It ain't worth it. I can't do this anymore. I mean, it's insane. Though it's what you want, that's going to get you out of here. Trust me. Trust you? Get the fuck away from me. -Hey, don't act so disgusted. -You love me. No, I need you.

(LAUGHING NERVOUSLY) So tell me, when did you first realize that you wanted to be a stripper? It runs in the family. When I was ten, my sister used to come in the room and I do a little number for her, you know. All right. I was... I was wondering the same thing. Go ahead. We'll start there. Do you want the harsh reason, or do you want the sappy reason? Harsh. Harsh... Because I can live in a beautiful apartment. And I could buy nice things. All right. Give me snappy. For me, stripping means being desired and... beautiful. And it makes me feel most alive. For most people... Hey, most people are just messed up about their own sexualities, so judging me helps them keep their masks on. Fine. How long have you been married? Oh. (CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY) Um... I've been married ten years, give or take... Whatever. The problem is, I don't think we'll last another week. -What's wrong? -I don't know. Usual stuff. I work too many hours, I don't see her. Her hours are just as bad though. She's a lawyer. -To lawyers. -I don't think I want to drink to that. Hey, besides, you guys might work things out. Thanks. When can we meet again? Oh, I don't know. I can tell this is going to get very personal. At first I thought this was going to be good for me, but I'm not so sure. Look, it's going to be a great story. I want you to be comfortable and... Look, all right, I'll tell you what. Let's meet a few more times, see how it goes and... -Okay? -All right. Hey, listen, about your wife, better go to her right away before she gets too comfortable with leaving. Oh, you mean don't give her too much time and space.

He shouldn't be here, Angie. It's wrong! -It's wrong. I'm sorry, but it's wrong! -That's not the point! -Take it easy. -Since we've been together, you've been missing the point. All right. Then why don't you tell me the goddamn point, Angie? You don't know how to show up, Martin. That's the point. I love you, Angie. Don't worry, you'll be fine. He's all yours now, Doc. Angie...

Does this make you my agent? This guy, he... No, no, no. I just said that at the time so he thought he was dealing with someone, you know? Yeah, someone who knows a thing or two about making movies.

You got to use it. Use them all, man. -I got it. -Our law department will worry about it later. -Huh? -Okay. I got it. I mean, you know, too much is good, it's better.

Hey, don't be fooled by the light hair prep school thing. I'm a scumbag just like you. Let's play. Come on. Come on... -Let's play. -You know, I can't believe how much I love this. Totally different from the column. Something doesn't work, I make it up. -You work too much. -I like it. I got that job at the Body Stop. I thought you might want a little special celebration dance. -Are you sure you want to dance? -That's what I do, honey. Yeah. I know. But see, I'm not so sure I want you to strip. Well, you don't have to be sure. It's what I do. And don't you forget how well. -A cup of tea? -Thanks. All right. So, why did you follow me out to this desert? You said you were never going to leave Detroit remember? -Yeah. Well, things happen. -What? A fella? -Yeah. -Who is he? God, Roxy. He's beautiful. So what? So are you. He's a writer. He's out here working on a script. And what does he know? Anything? Some. Doesn't sound like any. Poor bastard. -Well, introduce me when you tell him everything. -Come on Roxy, don't be mean. -Do you want this to work? -Of course, I do. I don't think I would have followed him out here if I didn't. Sara, you look good. You know, I can tell you've been behaving yourself, but... Well, secrets aren't good for people like us. It's not easy to live like we live and still be alive. Since I stopped dancing, I'm doing great. You know, I love my job. I have a nice sweet place, but I didn't have to do it by myself. Neither do you. If you need someone, I'm here, okay? Thanks. -Are you hungry? -I'm starved. -Good. Because you're cooking. -All right. (LAUGHING) This executive, he's got to go in to another room to talk to an actor who loves the script -this guy hates. -Yeah. The executive wants to fire the screenwriter, but the actor wants to keep him. He says it's the closest thing to Faulkner he's ever read. The executive replies, "Then get me Faulkner, because I'm not making this movie the way it's written now. "Get me Faulkner on the phone," he yells out. -I mean he actually thought Faulkner is alive. -But I want to know, -what did he think of your script? -Liked it. You know, he thought it had the same the qualities as the column. He thought that the story developed at a good pace, that each of the main characters develop... You know, we're fighting some tough personal conflict and just the way they talk, you know, except for the Virginia character. Who's Virginia? She's... She's the female character. Right. Yeah. He thought... He thought that she was kind of not full enough or something. I don't want to talk about it. I like this a lot by the way. Go on. I want to hear this. Look, the guy, he read the piece I wrote about you, right? And he wants to create a darker past, to use the crack head and... Well, you're a writer, make something up. Yeah. No. Absolutely. But I mean he's stuck on that particular guy. You know, he played the cello that he found the drugs when he fell in love with the stripper, and that you danced to his... I mean, that Virginia danced to his... I mean, you did dance to his... That was his music, right? And... And I want you to know that I gave you my word, and I know that and everything, but I thought given the circumstances, you'd be okay with it Are you? Are you okay with it? -No. I'm not. -No. But it's the guy that... Martin, listen to me, okay. There's more to the story than you can possibly imagine. Leave it alone. Listen, listen, listen, it's about this guy. They're stuck on this particular guy. It has nothing to do with you. It has everything to do with me. He is real. The guy is real. He used to play music, yes. He used to drugs, and now he's so badly burned that he can't even pick up a piece of paper, so don't you tell me it doesn't have anything to do with me. I hate that man for some of the things he said to me, but I would rather be dead. God damn you. Leave it alone. Hey, Jimmy. Hey Doc, how you doing? Hiya, Phil. What brings you guys out this way? Came out to grab a tan... and Ricky's money. Degenerate gambler. He thinks everybody love him. Says he's got no money, look at the house he's living in. Come on, watch out. Don't splash, you're going to ruin my outfit. Come here. You know, Ricky, he loves movies. And he wants to see you do good. So, Doc, get this movie made, or you're a dead man. Philly, come on. Let's go to the theme park. It's 6:00 in the morning. I know. I'm beat. There was a private party. Yeah. Me too. Where are you going? Look, when we made this trip, I asked, I thought you would do something different with your life. If I decide to do something different with my life, and I'm not saying I will, it will be when I'm ready. Come on, Sara. It's about what it's about. I mean it's stripping in front of men. And thank God for that. It was good for me for a long, long time. So please stop expecting me to change overnight. It's not going to happen. You want to change? You have to work at it. Pay the price. Make sacrifices. Like your wife or that guy who got killed after you spilled his guts in your column? I mean, are these the sacrifices that you're talking about? Yes. As a matter of fact they are. You think you're the only person who's seen things, huh? I've seen things my whole life all around me all the time, horrible things, but I was quiet, so I was lucky. I wasn't noticed. I got by untouched, so I managed to get out and you know what? I swore if I ever got out, I would tell people about the things I saw, no matter how awful these things were, I knew that's what I had to do, no matter what the consequences. You know why? Because I honestly thought I could make things better. And if you think those consequences didn't hurt, you're wrong and you don't know me. And I don't know why the hell you'd want to be with me. Martin, I do. I do. You know I do. DOC: You're balls. It's like you lost your balls. Martin, what happened? The people, they don't sell like themselves anymore, -and the woman character. -What about her? -She's a victim. -A victim? A victim, Martin. Nothing worse than watching a victim. I mean you're watching her cry for a hundred-twenty pages, and I'm sorry, I want to crack her in the mouth. That's the way I hear it. Look, let me tell something, all right? Every once in a great while, these people want to make a movie that's honest, -that has teeth. -What are you talking about? It's time to dig deeper. It's time to use the lovely Caprice. No. That's not what we sold them. She's not even in the book. They don't give a shit where it's from. They write up to you made a deal in the book. So what? They know what's good. They expect you to use it. Look, I gave her my word, all right? I know how she feels about this thing. She made it very clear. What is she going to do? I mean, where does she come off? Do you know why we're not in an office, an office on the lot? Because you won't do what it takes. That's just not true. That's bullshit. But this is not your wife we're talking about here, and I don't mean we should assassinate her, but I don't want to see you toss this thing because you're afraid you're going to hurt somebody's feelings. So, let's make a mature decision. Let's put the stripper in the movie. You put her in the movie, we have an office on the lot and we're on our way to making a movie, Martin, a made movie. Do you realize the odds? So, what's it's going to be? All right, all right. Maybe it's me, I... I'm not communicating. Look, Martin, Martin, I'm not trying to tell you how to do things here. Martin look, you can't not do this. -What? Why? -I'm just trying to do my job man, and you're not letting -me, you're just not letting me. -That's right, Doc, I'm not. -Hey. -Hi. I'll be back a little bit. Bye. Hey, Sara how are you doing? Hey, Sara... Don't forget where you come from. Thanks. I'll remember that. -Stan. -There he is. -How are you doing? -How are you, Doc? -Good, good. You read the script? -Sure I read the script. -What do you think? -It's good. -I'm glad you showed it to me before we go to Larry, though. -Yeah? Come on in, we'll talk. -Give us ten, then bring in messages, please. -You got it. I'm going to get right to the point, Doc. This isn't going to work. -Why? -Well, -you lied to me, Doc. -How? You made me a promise and you didn't deliver. -Stan, I'm working on him. -Doc, you didn't use this article. Come on... The stripper, crack head boyfriend bursting in the flames... That's poetry. Now, there is stuff going on inside this woman that we need. Get him to do it. Stop wasting my time. He's slowing down. I mean things with her, it's... -slowing him down. -Of course she's slowing him down. She's a stripper. You can't live with a stripper. It doesn't work. -Travel. -What? Yvonne, make a reservations in the Desert for two this weekend. -Names? -Pugliese and Ryan. -On our account? -Our account. So, the first night, you guys have fun. Then, give me three days of work and I'll have when you come back. I know your situation, Doc. Give us another minute Yvonne, okay? What situation? You owe a lot of money to these pretty dangerous people. -How do you know that? -I want you to use it. -Use it all. -No. How do you know that, Stan? Accountant's son's college roommate. Well then, if you know this then tell them, tell them to lay off. Tell them we're moving ahead with this thing, to get off my back. Doc, Doc, Doc. This is a caste system out here, okay? You want to move up, you do something great. You make people take notice, like in the outfit, whether you want to be a made guy, you make a hit. You blow up a building, you set someone on fire, right? Out here, you make a movie. And I happen to know that if you make this movie, you wipe out your debt to Ricky? -Is that true? -True. And if you tell them I told you, I'll deny it. Remind me to break your legs when this is over. Go. Have fun in the desert. I'll just have to settle for something else. There's a million other things I can write about. They want this, Martin. They're stuck on this particular thing. Two words Stan said to me, non-negotiable, that's what it said. -It does, Doc. Leave it alone. -You don't need this. -We're in a nice... -You're going to need support. You shouldn't be feeling -guilty right now. -Well, this kind of stupid loyalty -shake that you're trying... -You're more worried about what she's going to do with -her life than making this thing fly. -It's two separate things. -She needs time to settle in. -Oh, really? Let me ask you something. Where was she before we brought her out here? Shangri-La? I mean, let's not be silly here, Martin. This place is like heaven compared to where she came from. No, I'm sorry, Martin. I'm pissed. That pisses me off. Look. Look, it's like this. It's as if I like you're my horse and I got to look after you. That's all. I'm not the horse, I'm the writer. I don't do that kind of work. I don't like to get my hands dirty. -Oh, is that right? -That's right. That's why I have you. Oh, what does she have a right to object to? That somebody took those depressing stories she calls a life -and turn them into poetry? -You shut up. Just shut the fuck up, all right? Look, Martin. Wait a minute. -I owe money. -What? To Ricky, a hundred grand. You let your marker get to a hundred grand? What's wrong with you? -Why are you telling me this now? -Because Ricky is tied in with the studio, Martin. He's tied in, he knows. It's like they got some laundry operation, I don't know. But if I don't get this movie made, he's going to kill me. -This isn't going to work. Don't even try. -Oh, yeah. Right, Martin. God forbid you do something for someone other than yourself. God forbid, you save your best friend's life. -I do what's right. -Oh, really? You are so full of shit. I can't take this anymore. Listen, your sweet Sara, -she's not what you think she is. -What are you talking about? She's not just a stripper. She's a hooker Martin, she hooks. Maybe not here, maybe not now, but definitely in Detroit. Fact, Martin, I swear to Christ. Ricky told me. As soon as your article hit the newsstand, he said, "I know this girl. "Well," He told me. "I know this girl very well." You see this? You see what we're doing, Martin? Why? Why are we fighting? Because of her, and she's a whore. What are you going to do with that thing? I want to rob a bank. I want to be the triggerman on this terrific bank job. Because, Martin, Hollywood is like this big bank, but there are no men with guns. They got this weird way with lawyers and agents and newspapers. But there's no one watching the gold. But see, I got the balls, but not the skills. You got skills. So, you keep the sensitive guy bullshit for whoever wants to buy it, but don't with me, because see, I know how badly you want this. The only thing standing our way right now is her. And she's a hooker. I'm sorry. I didn't want to hurt you. I didn't want hurt you, Martin. You think I want to hurt you? If I'm wasting my time, you got to tell me. You got to tell me if I'm wasting my time. What do you want, Martin? This is what I want. I know. From what you've been telling me, you're going to have to tell the truth. If you don't come clean and share your pain, it breaks you apart. It's a law of nature. -What's that? An Irish thing? -I'm being serious, love. I mean, you came all the way from Detroit for this man, the least you can do is tell him. What happened wasn't your fault. Someday, you're going to have to let go of it. Why not now? -Because I'm angry. -Who's not? That's why I stripped. To hold men in my grasp, controlling them, that's a good angry bit. Then you see the anger's going nowhere and neither are you. And so what now? You're going to tell me to quit dancing? It's not about dancing, Sara, it's about you. You've been carrying this secret with you for too long. -It wasn't your fault. -It was. So if it was, it's done. -Roxy, it hurts. -I know. I know. And I'm sorry, love, but it's time for you to start loving now. Come on. ♪ ♪ -The audience was going crazy. -It was great. You were terrific. I want Roxy to do a comeback, team you two up again. MARTIN: Hey, how did you get a job on the Sunset Strip? Who wants to know? I'm a reporter, remember? -You know this guy? -Why, do you think she knows you? Listen, it's all right. It's all right. You guys, you're just go on ahead without me. No, no, no. Why don't you introduce me to your friends? You must be Martin. I'm Roxy. Is that your real name? Come on, Lou. I'll see you tomorrow, love. So what's with the King Kong routine? -What, you don't like it? -No, I don't, not much. You see, I thought you would. So maybe this is my snapshot, maybe this is who I am. Maybe this is exactly the kind of guy you need to be with. I should have stayed away from you. STAN: I got to go. They're right here. I know. Yes. I do. Goodbye. Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Here it is. It's great. I should send you guys out to the Desert more often. What about Larry? That was him on the phone right now. He's on his way over. -And? -He loves it. Ha ha. He loves it. It's great. Ain't that great, Martin? -It's great. -Martin... I got to tell you, man, putting the stripper back into the script... Just, the stakes went to the fucking roof.

I saw you as this sweet person who I trusted. Well, what kind of person were you that I should trust when you told me that you weren't a hooker? I said I don't hook, and I don't. I don't drink, I don't do drugs, and I don't hook. That doesn't mean I didn't. I wanted to make myself better. I didn't want to lose that. Is that supposed to make me feel good?
