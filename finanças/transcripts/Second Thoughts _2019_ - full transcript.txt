(electronic whirring) (electronic music) (glass clinking) (liquid pouring) - (exhales) I'm happy my son's here on a Saturday afternoon and he's got something that he wants to talk to me about. So what is it you wanna talk to me about? (upbeat music) (country music) - I'm gonna hit the head. - Cool, man, I'm gonna circle around, just go about some of the town. - So how's work? - Work is going well, I just got an assistant, so hopefully that makes my job easier. - Unless they aren't good, and then it'll be harder. - Then, good point. (both laughing) How are things with Tim? - Oh, they're really good. I just, I can't believe how happy I am, you know? I feel like a scored the boyfriend jackpot. - If only all of us could be so lucky. - Oh, okay. I hate to be that person, but Tim is about to get off work and I told him that I would meet up with him. - Don't think anything of it, go, go. I'm gonna stay here and finish my drink and then I'll probably just get another one 'cause it's been that kind of a week. - Okay, be safe. - Say hi to Tim For me. - Okay. (feet clicking) (chattering) (country music) - This seat taken? - It's as though you timed it perfectly. - Timing's never been my specialty, luck maybe. - Better lucky than good? - That's like my slogan. (Samantha laughs) - (laughs) Jimmy. - Samantha. - Why are you drinking alone, Samantha? - Oh, my friend just left. She went to go meet up with her boyfriend. - Well, I guess it worked out perfectly 'cause I'm here now. - Well, I don't know about that. She is probably better at girl talk than you. - Yeah, but I can tell you how I maintain my long and luscious hair. - (laughs) Well, it must be the leave-in conditioner. - You know my secret. (Samantha laughs) - [Waitress] Jimmy, you left your credit card on the table. - I'll be right back. ♪ It's not your fault ♪ ♪ You take the part of summer rain ♪ ♪ When you take ♪ - Hi, I don't suppose you've seen the bartender somewhere, have you? - Not within the past 15 minutes. - (scoffs) That's where it's like, they don't want you to drink here. (Samantha chuckles) Every time you want one, they're never around. - And then when you don't need one, they're right there. - (scoffs) Exactly. So what are you drinking there...? - Samantha. - Ryan. Pleasure. - Are you genuinely interested in what I'm drinking or are you just envious that I still have a drink? - Mm, honestly, a bit more of the second one. (both laughing) - Well, my drink is getting low and I would like to have another one, but it doesn't seem that that will likely happen here. - Well, (chuckles) there's a bar a couple doors down, quick service, terrible food. - (glass taps) That's great. We'll get the drinks first then we'll worry about the food later. (feet clicking) - Hey, there, did you need another drink? - No, I think I'm good for now. - A bit what? (chattering) Hey, you know what? On second thought, let me get a Jack on the rocks. - You got it. (feet pattering) (door knocking) (door squeaks) - Hey. - Hi. - You ready to go? - Mhm. (slams door) (upbeat music) She says to me that I have a bunch of messages, but she didn't take them down because she was on the other line talking to her friend, and I'm like, "You're making my job so much harder." - Yeah, it does it so. - It's so frustrating. Do you have any problems with that? - [Ryan] All the time. (classical music) - I wonder if they have frozen drinks here. - Yeah, I'm already thinking about my food. - [Woman] What are you planning to order? - Chicken nuggets! - Really? - No, I'm just kidding. Probably wings, though. - Ooh, I love wings. I'd have some if you ordered them. - Hot? - Sounds good. - Maybe after we can grab some fro-yo. - I love frozen yogurt. - A place around the corner from me has the best fro-yo. They have every flavor- - No way. - You can possibly imagine. (door knocking) (door squeaks) - Hey, you ready to go? - Your timing's perfect. I just finished getting ready. - Awesome. - So are you gonna tell me where we're going? You wouldn't tell me on the phone. Do I still have to wait? - Well, you remember how you wanted to go see "The Book of Mormon?" An associate for my firm got me a couple of tickets and we are going. (both laugh) - Oh, my God, that's amazing. - Oh, hey, you still here? - Yeah, I was thinking maybe we could get breakfast together or something. - Yeah, it sounds cool. We really didn't get much of a chance to talk last night. - (chuckles) Yeah, we got a little wild quickly. - (laughs) Yeah, we did. - So how come you have such a small bed? - It's big enough for me. - Well, I guess we're just gonna have to be close and cuddle. (laughs) - Yeah. So are you ready for breakfast? - Yeah. (soft music) (door knocking) (door clicks) - Hey, how are you? - I'm good, this is for you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Oh, they smell beautiful, thank you. Come on in. I know that, but like Cabernet, Pinot Noir, Merlot, do you have a favorite? - You know, I do actually. I like it Malbec. - Mhm. - It's a- - I like Malbec, too. - Yeah, it's so good. - Cheers. (glass clinking) (both laughing) Stupid joke! (gentle music) - These past three weeks have been really great. - I've been having so much fun with you, Rebecca. - I've been having so much fun with you too. - Maybe this weekend, we should go away. We could get a little room in the Poconos with a fireplace. - A romantic weekend? Are we planning on leaving the room at all? - Not if we can help it. (Rebecca laughs) - So this is really nice. - It is and you cooked me a beautiful meal. - Well, it's the only meal I know how to cook. Jimmy's obsessed with food and he thinks everyone should have a go-to meal, so. - So this is your one go-to meal? - It is, I hope you like it. - I do, I do like it, but maybe we'll teach you how to cook a few more dishes. - Mm, well, I'm willing to learn a second dish just for you, I promise. (Samantha laughs) - Okay, I'm gonna hold you to that. - Cheers. (glass clinking) - I think if we can prove intent, we have got them by the balls. - Easier said than done, my friend. Look, they've pulled this stuff before, now we have to prove it. - Did you read the transcript from the last time when they were sued by Martinez? Perhaps there's something in here that'll show a pattern. - Honestly, I skimmed it, but there wasn't much in, did you catch that weird stenographer error? It's like half of this is incoherent. Does that surprise you with this one? - Ryan, Samantha's on line three for you. - Oh, could you tell her I'm really busy, I'll call her back? - Okay, I'll let her know. - Look, there's no smoking gun here, but we gotta find something. - If it's in here, we'll find it. - Okay, thank you. (Samantha sighs) (Ryan sighs) (phone rings) - Look here, this is part of Martinez, it doesn't make any sense to me. Did you read this? - I did, did the judge real favorably on their motion? - (sighs) That's what doesn't make any sense. It's like the motion was there, it was heard and then weirdly it was shepardized to something else that happened in the past. So, okay. (sighs) - I don't know. It's that kind of case, my friend. (Ryan chuckles) - Ryan, we were supposed to have dinner date night, remember? You promised you'd be on time for this. (gentle music) (phone tapping) (Samantha sighs) (Samantha blows) ♪ Tonight you got of me ♪ ♪ For I have fallen for you ♪ ♪ I dream of my ♪ - How do you know someone isn't sitting there? - 'Cause no one tapped me on the shoulder and asked me to get out of their seat. - (laughs) Good deduction, but my friend is coming. - Well, I guess I'll just keep you company until she gets here. - How do you know it's a she? It could be my friend coming to meet me. - Well, I know it's a female because you haven't asked me to leave yet. And if you had a boyfriend meeting you, he'd see the two of us together and think, wow, they look much better than we could possibly look. (Tonya laughs) So he'd go away. - A bit sure of yourself there, huh? - You haven't told me I'm wrong. (Tonya laughs) So what's your name or should I just call you beautiful? - (laughs) I'm Tonya. And should I just call you the guy with the lines? - I think Jimmy's a little easier. - (laughs) I think so too. - Look, I'm sorry, I got caught up in work. - This is the fourth time in two months that you stood me up. - You know I'm trying to make partner, okay, I can't leave work there on the table just 'cause I have to come home for dinner. - You shouldn't have to come home, Ryan, you should want to, okay? If this is just a chore to you, I don't know why we do these things. It would be so much quicker to just do regular dinner without these candles and planning. - You know I didn't mean it that way. - No, you did. You say you don't, but if it was important to you, you would make the time. - (scoffs) I'm doing the best I can, I don't know what else I can do. - Nothing, okay? Let's just forget about it. - Come on, let's talk about it, please. - No, I'm tired, okay? I'm just gonna go to bed. - Sam, let's not go to bed mad. - I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed. (piano music) I thought it was going to be just the two of us. - Well, I didn't think you'd mind if Jimmy and his new girlfriend joined us. - You mean Jimmy and his flavor of the week? It was supposed to be just us. - Next time, I promise. - (sighs) That's what you said the last time when he was with the girl with the purple hair. (Ryan chuckles) - I promise it'll be fine. Come on, it'll be fun. - Hi. - Hi. I'm Tonya. [Samantha] Hi. Samantha, nice to meet you. - Oh, so nice to meet you too. - Hi pleasure, Ryan. - Nice to meet you. - Hi, nice to meet you, too. - Jimmy. - Hey, Sam. - How's it going? - How ya doing? (Tonya laughs) - What's up, buddy? - Hey, how you doing, man? - Good. - [Tonya] We got you guys some Rulo, if that's okay. - Oh, that's great. - Thank you, head start. (Tonya laughs) - [Tonya] Yes. - Cheers? - Mhm. - Aw, cheers, guys. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Nice to meet you all. (glass clinking) - Nice to meet you all. - So how long have you two been going out? - It's been about a month and a half. - Ooh! - Fun. - Yep, it has been. - I have a blast with this one. - Last weekend we went go-karting. Jimmy here kept thinking we were going bumper guarding, though. - (laughs) Yeah, yeah, that sounds a bit like Jimmy. One of the many reasons why I don't go go-karting with him. - He won't go laser tagging would me either. (Samantha and Tonya laughing) - Don't remind me. - Wait, what happened? - Here we go again. - All right, I get really into it when I play laser tag. So I was diving over this barricade- - Oh yeah, giant foam stuff that's made to look like Guylian rocks. - Yeah. like I said, barricade (Tonya laughs) and I didn't realize he was standing there and I wound up knocking him over. - Yeah, you just, you literally fell over that rock, by the way, that wasn't you, athletic feat. - I am the laser tag champion. - Okay, but like a child though, is the point - But like a superhero, like he does what needs to get done to win the game. - Uh-huh, yeah. - And if that means jumping over stuff, then he does it. - [Ryan] Like a child, yeah. (Samantha and Ryan laughing) - [Woman On TV] And then I was so over it. (Jimmy laughs) - I had a really nice time tonight. - Yeah, me too. - Your friends are really sweet. - (laughs) Yeah, they're great. (sparks buzzing) Oh shit, she tased him. (both laughing) - How long have you and Ryan known each other? - Since high school, since high school. - That's so nice. - Oh, look, babe, they're tying him up. (Jimmy laughs) - Psycho. - You know I hate that word. - Oh, that's awesome, look at that. - [Man On TV] You can think of another word- (Jimmy laughs) - He's in trouble. Oh, shit, she's gonna smack him. (slapping) Oh! - So how long have you guys been together? - Two months and going strong. What is that, like a new record? - Might be, I mean, I'm still having fun with her. (glass clinking) - Nice, that's good. - So how's work? - Things are really good there. I'm on the way to make partner. - That's good to hear, I'm happy for you, buddy. - Thanks, man, I've been busting my butt over there. - How's Samantha? - Things are really good too. I feel like we just get each other so well. - How long has this been going on for? - I don't know, maybe the past year. - [Kelly] Have you said anything to Ryan about it? - What am I gonna say? Show me that you give a shit about me? - I mean, if he is standing you up and not paying attention to you, maybe. - I don't know, Kelly, I'm almost afraid of what his response would be. - What do you mean? - I have expected him to tell me that he just doesn't even love me anymore. - What? He wouldn't say that. - I honestly don't know what he would say, but by the way that he acts, I don't think he sees a future together. I feel like he wants to break up and he's just too busy to get around to it. - Does he talk about a future together at all? - No, he always talks about work and that's about it. - [Kelly] Does he show interest in you? - We talk all the time and I tell him about my day, but it's like, he's on autopilot. I think he's already checked out. - What are you gonna do? - I'm not sure. - Any big weekend plans or? - Um, no, nothing in particular. What about yourself? - We're going down the shore, you know, hanging out, bringing Tonya. - Yeah, it's perfect weekend for it, I mean, long weekend, that's what it's for. - Hey, you and Sam should think about taking a ride down. - I don't know, maybe. You know what? Yeah I have been working like a dog, I haven't seen much of her, so yeah, I could use the rest. You know what? Yeah, we're in, let's do it. - Cool. (glass clinking) (hangers rattle) - This is gonna be an awesome weekend. - Seeing you and Jimmy get drunk? Why can't we just spend time just the two of us? - What? You have a problem with this going down with Jimmy and Tonya for the weekend? - No, I just don't understand why we always have to do things with them instead of spending time together. - We do spend time together. - Ryan, we don't. You've been really busy with work and I understand, (Ryan sighs) but we haven't done even a date in a while. - Listen, I appreciate you putting up with me, it's been a tough time, but I promise, we'll have plenty of time to spend together down there, okay? - Okay. - I love you. - I love you. (lips smacking) (Ryan sighs) (upbeat music) (lock clicking) - Oh, hey (laughs) look at this. - Aw! - Are you kidding? - This is nice. - Isn't this awesome? - Babe! Look at this view. - Oh, my god. - This is gonna be great, - Hey, buddy. - Just with you. - Aw! - How's it going? (hands slapping) - Hey! - [Ryan] Hey, how you doing, man? - Jimmy, how are you? - Hey, Sam, what's up? - How are you? - Good. - Hey, Ryan, hey Samantha. - Hey! - [Samantha] Hey. (lips smacking) - Good to see you, Tonya. - Good to see you. How was the ride? - Oh my God, it was an easy ride. It was super cool and so happy to be here. Look at this, place. - Yeah. - Well, we already stocked the fridge. - [Samantha] Oh thank you. - And the cooler. - Oh, nice, good job. (laughs) - We are just ready for some R and R. - Yeah, absolutely. - Yeah, so are we, absolutely it's been such a long- - And the guy we rented the place from said he lives just down the beach, he's gonna check in on us, see if we need anything. - Oh yes, good guy or what? - Looks like a great guy. - Yeah. - I'd definitely have a cocktail with him. (Tonya laughs) - I think we're gonna get 'em out. - Jim and him seem like- - We're gonna get him to come by for sure. - Best buds. - Okay, awesome. The more, the merrier. - He seems really friendly. (Tonya laughs) - I love it. - What do you feel like doing today? - I'm thinking the beach. - The beach. - She's like staring. - Oh, hell, yeah. - I'm thinking the beach too. Let's do the beach day, yeah. - Let's do the beach day. It's gorgeous. - Awesome, we're gonna throw our bags in here. - Sounds great. - Are you on drinks? - Yes. - What do you wanna drink? - [Ryan] Just a beer, it'd be great. - Beer, beer's good? - Yeah. - I'll do a margarita, please. - Awesome. - Now that is my girl. (Jimmy mumbles) (Tonya laughs) - Look at this, just look at it. - [Tonya] I'm gonna help you. - This is amazing. - Love it. - You guys hungry? (Tonya laughs) - I could eat. - I could eat, yeah. - You're gonna go on the water or just like chill on the beach. - I don't know, depends if I wanna get my hair wet. - Yeah, (laughs), that's what I was thinking too. - I have an Afro. As soon as it hits (clicks fingers) the water, it's like, bam. (Samantha and Tonya laughing) - I think that's a sure thing. - A straight up Afro, that is, that is awesome. - Yeah! - [Tonya] Wow, can you smooth out that peanut butter a little bit. (laughs) - Sure. - He's doing great. - [Tonya] Sorry. - Come on. (Tonya laughs) I'm not a culinary expert. - Did you just. (laughs) - It's all right, it's all right, try your best, bud, try your best. - Oh, boy, all right. - He's doing good. - [Jimmy] I know. I know. - What are you making there, bud? - Peanut butter and jelly. - Oh, nice. - Yum. - I think you should always eat a lot before you go to the beach. - Why is that? - So you won't have to leave early 'cause you're hungry. (Tonya laughs) - I'm just putting this - You just think - out there. - Of everything, don't you? - I sure do. - Sam you can't argue (lips smacking) with that logic. - Where's my sandwich? (laughs) - I got another half for you. - I'm proud of you. - It was like- - Really leaps and bounce. - I appreciate it. - What's going on with that thing? (Tonya laughs) That's- - I don't know, I think he slacked on mine a little bit. - You don't love me for my culinary pro ass, do you? (Tonya laughs) - I would hope not. - I love you for everything, you're just- - I like that. - [Jimmy] So we beach it today? - I would love to. That view was just too good to miss out on. - Jimmy, Jimmy, what am I gonna do with you? (Tonya laughs) - Whatever you want. - Mm, really? - Oh, yeah. - I could think of a few things. - So can I. (Tonya laughs) (gentle music) - [Tonya] Twice them and see if we have voice. (upbeat music) (Jimmy cheers) - I want to see the dance like from last night you were trying to teach me. - One. - [Jimmy] The dance floor would thank me. Wow, hey now, wow. (Tonya laughs) - You're so funny. - Sorry, sweetheart. - Sorry, I just can't see. - That's okay. (laughs) - I literally just can't see at all. (upbeat music) - Like when you're left. (laughing) - All right, this is fine. - Yeah. - Oh, thank you. - I'm gonna take a shower to wash off all the salt water. You wanna come? - Sure. (lips smacking) (thudding) Sorry! - That's okay. - [Tonya] (laughs) You always catch me. - They're so cute. - I was gonna take a shower and wash off all the salt water. - Were you? - Yeah. - Oh, we were like that once, right? - We're still like that. - (laughs) No, we're not. - I think we've matured. - Are you kidding? - No, it's good, but- - Okay when was the last time we had shower sex? Or you took me out on a proper date? - A proper date? - Where I get dressed up and you get dressed up and it's fancy and nice and. It's been a while. - I'm not gonna say we're past that, but we're, I mean, I feel like- - Well, we're not like that. - No. (laughs) Well that's why we're here. (Samantha laughs) I'm serious. - Okay. - It's gonna be awesome, you'll see. - Okay, very cool. - Yeah. (gentle music) - Yeah, I always hate going and renting the place to like college kids 'cause they always trash the place. - Yeah. - Some bad guys. (laughs) - I like college kids. (Tonya laughs) - Yeah, you can clean up after them. (laughs) - That's 'cause you're still basically a college kid. - Yeah. (laughs) - He doesn't grow up. - A little bit. - Nothing's wrong with that. - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah. My wife was like from Brooklyn so when we bought this place, she goes, "We need to have exposed brick." And I was like, "Why? We're not in Brooklyn, we're not hipsters." And she's like, "But I want the brick." - Aw. - That's how she talks. Yeah, that's how she talks. She eats helium first and goes (sucks) now tell me what are we doing? (Jimmy laughing) - Aw, that's terrible. - Are you, yeah, you're married? - Yeah, I've been married eight years this winter. - Oh congrats. - Oh! - Wow, what's that like? - A long time? - It's good. I mean eight years strong and we still can't get enough of each other. (laughing) I like spending every day with you. - (moans) That's fun. - Yeah. - Mm, you're so strong. - Only for you. (laughing) - Unfortunately, I think I need to go checking on the renters, down the beach. - Oh my gosh, you are so sweet. Wait a second, though, that means you have to leave me. So why don't you pretend I am your tenant. Oh, and I can't pay the rent. Isn't there anything I can do to take care of the rent? Oh, please! - Oh what shall we do to cover your rent. - Can't we figure something out? - Really? It's like that? - Well. (yawns) I think I'm gonna go down the beach and check in on the renters. - The renters? (laughs) God, I swear to God, if you go down to the bar again, I will change the fucking locks. - I'm not gonna go to the bar. I'm not gonna drink, I promise. - You're such a fucking liar. I'm gonna check on you. - [Matt] Yes, dear. (sighs) Yeah, there's a reason I'm so happy to hang out with you guys. (laughs) - [Tonya] Aw you're welcome here anytime. - Thank you. (laughs) - You're allowed to, brother. - Oh, absolutely, man. - Yeah, I mean my favorite time of the year here is when my wife is away. - (laughs) Oh, - Unfortunately, it doesn't happen enough. - That's so sad. - No! - A bit disturbing. (Matt laughs) I hear you, brother, I hear you. - Yeah. Jimmy's a, he's more in that wavelength. Yeah, I hear you. - Marriage is a big deal. (chattering) - Marriage is a huge deal. - I don't blame 'em, I mean- - But listen, they're- - marriage can be scary. - You could (mumbles). - But they're making it work, you know, eight years in, that's amazing. - Yeah. - That's amazing. - Yeah, but he doesn't look too happy. - Really? I got a cold beer in my hand, I'm happy. - He looks real happy to me. (Matt laughs) - Without your wife there, yeah. (laughs) - Well, we don't know what he's like. I'm sure he's just making fun. - I make fun a lot. Especially when she yells at me. - Well, you're welcome anytime. - Yeah, dude, you're awesome. - And if you wanna hang out with us more, just invite us here more, you know? Skip the whole paying thing? - Yeah, except for what we'll do is I'll wait until my wife is away and like take you guys over to my house, I have a fire pit on the beach. - [Jimmy] I'm gonna grab another drink. - [Ryan] That's amazing. - Yeah, I'm just not allowed to use it when she's around. - Oh, can you grab me one? - Yes, okay. - Yeah, she gets a little, oh, you outside? Why aren't you inside cleaning? And I'm like, "'Cause the house is clean." - Yeah? - You know what? We would take you up on that. - I should have asked Jimmy for a drink. I'll just go, I'll get it myself. - Oh, sure. - I'll be right back. - Yeah. - [Samantha] (groans) Excuse me, guys. - That's awesome, though. Yeah, I know the fire pit sounds amazing, but what? Sorry, I just wanted to wait until she's out of the room. Do you know of anyone around here where I can rent a boat? Kind of take her out - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - on the water? Actually there's this guy right down the beach. Let's get, his name's Jack. Here, let me give you his contact. - [Ryan] Oh yeah. - I'm positive, he'll just take you out. He loves taking everyone he can offer. - Really? - Mhm, anyone he can for rides, yeah. - Jimmy, how are you? I feel like I haven't seen you in weeks and you look like you've been working out. - Thank you. - Yeah, you look good, did you lose weight, too? - Thank you so much. Yeah, you know, I work out like a maniac. - Good for you. - Go about eating right. - You look fantastic. And you got a haircut, didn't you? - [Jimmy] Yeah. - [Samantha] Yeah, it looks a little shorter on the sides, too. - If I cut back on the booze, you'd be knowing all about it. (Samantha laughs) But, you know, it's what it is. - And you've got the scruff working and everything. - Thank you. - Look at you. - You like it? - Yeah, you look different. - Well I was debating whether I wanted to do a beard or shave it off. - No, you look really good. - Gotcha. I appreciate that, thank you, Sam. - You're welcome. - You look good too. - Thank you, thanks a lot. - Very welcome. (Samantha laughs) I'm just really happy that we're here. We really needed this break. - I agree with you, yeah. It's been a while, we should probably get back out there. - Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Matt seems really cool. - Yeah. - Okay. It was good to talk to you. - Yeah so then they went and just started taking the giant turtles and racing them. And I had a whole betting scheme going on for it. - (laughs) What? - It was like the talk of the town. (Ryan and Tonya laughing) - Okay, that sounds, you guys just missed an amazing story. - Oh yeah? (Ryan laughs) - [Tonya] It wasn't that amazing. (Ryan laughs) - Ouch! (Tonya and Ryan laughing) - Hey, be nice. - Just kidding. (Matt laughs) It was hilarious. (all laughing) - Hilarious! - Yeah, yeah, we milk that one to try and redeem itself. (laughs) Anyway, I should get back before the wife thinks that I'm out drinking - Thank you. - And change the locks on me. - [Ryan] Oh, yeah. - Well thank you again for letting us stay here. - Yeah. - Of course, if you guys need anything, we're done the beach, just let me know. - Oh, thanks. - Awesome, man. Thanks so much, appreciate it. - Bye, Matt. Poor guy. - [Jimmy] He is awesome, (Tonya laughs) I really love him already. - Seeing his life is like amazing. - Yeah, and that's kinda awesome. - Permanent vacation. - Permanent vacation. - The dude's done everything. - I don't know the wife situation, but he's great. - That's true yeah. - I just think he's so cool. - Jimmy. See how you act after eight years. You know what I'm saying? The guy's he's got it going on. - Ryan, I know you, I know you. I remember how you were even when you were taking a girl to the prom, it was always about the flowers and everything. Are you still the same way? Like I understand. You say I love you, I love you, I love you. Are you showing her, do you still do that? Do you show her you love her? - Dad, I am, I think so. It's been nuts at work, insane days. I have to prove to the partners who I am, what I can do and- - I'm not talking about work, though, I'm talking about relationships. I'm talking about this girl. I mean, I, look, look- - [Ryan] Her name's Samantha, Dad. - Yeah, fine. You know, one day you bring her over, I'll meet her, I'll remember her name, but the point I'm making is are you... Listen to me. You came over here, you want advice. I'm giving you advice. This isn't about work, right? This isn't about the partnership. I've been through all that, I've been, you know, you make sacrifices. You do, but you make sacrifices, if you're gonna choose when to make them, you make after you have a family, then you make the sacrifices. Now you're not there yet, right? So you can't always put the job above the girl, right? They, listen to me. They know when they're not number one. (Samantha sighs) - So what do you think of the place so far? - I really like this place. - Yeah? - Yeah. I do. It's just what we needed. - I think so too. - Yeah. (both laugh) - Jimmy's a nut. - I know. (laughs) - I can't believe him, honestly. I mean, it's just like- - I know him and Tonya, but I admire that. They seem very excited. - Excited, yeah. - Yes to do things. I think that's great. - No, it's good, it's just, what's he trying to prove though that PDA? - I don't think he's trying to prove anything, I think that's just who he is. We were like that one time. - Yeah, I suppose so, you know- - Yeah. - He is constantly starting over so it's always fresh and new and interesting, but- - (laughs) Well you're far from starting over. I know you've been very preoccupied with making partner and I know things have been a little tense, but you know, it won't hurt to pull a page out of Jimmy's book or maybe we should start trying to do things and be more adventurous. - Oh, I'm plenty adventurous. - (laughs) You were and you kinda lost it. - Oh, so I'm just old, crusty, stale and boring. Got it, thanks. (Samantha mumbles) - No, you're not. - Well just so you know, Missy, I have something planned for us. - (laughs) What's that? - Tomorrow I got a guy to take us out on a boat. - Really? - So there. - Are you kidding? - No. - Oh my gosh, this is great. - So- - We're going boating tomorrow? - Yeah, it's gonna be awesome. (Ryan laughs) (lips smacking) - That is not like you. - No, no, it's not, but- - Thank you. - You know, I... Thank you. (Samantha laughs) - Oh, this is gonna be great. I haven't gone boating in years. - I know and I know your dad took you out and that was a big thing for you and- - Yeah. Well, now I'm excited, I don't wanna go to sleep (both laugh) but- - Well we don't have to. - (laughs) Oh yeah, okay. - At least not right away. (Samantha laughs) I've been thinking about a lot of stuff and I know I've been busy and I know I've been kind of- - Preoccupied? - Yeah. And I'm sorry about that. - It's okay. - It's just, yeah. - I just, I would like to be the way that it used to be when we first started out, you know. And they have what we had. - We have it. We have it too. (lips smacking) Ours is just different. (gentle music) (lock clicking) - What's up, buddy? Can't get you going in the morning, like a morning swim with a beautiful woman? - Aw! (laughs) - Yeah, that does sound great. But Sam and I have our own plans. I hired this guy to take us out on a boat today. - Sounds fun. - Mm, that's so nice. Why don't you ever do that for me, babe? (both laugh) - I think there are some other stuff we can do. - Yeah, you guys do that a lot. (Tonya laughs) - Do we? Do you have any experience on a boat? - Boat? Ah, no, not so much, but she loves 'em. So you know, it's gonna be awesome. - All right, yeah. - That is so sweet. - Yeah, it's gonna be a great day. - You're such a good boyfriend. - Thank you, I appreciate that. - [Samantha] Hello. - [Ryan] Good morning. - Good morning. - How are you? (lips smacking) - Good. - Good morning, have fun. - [Samantha] Thank you. - So cute. - We'll see you guys, have a good one. (mumbling) - Let's go. - [Jimmy] See you later. - [Tonya] It's gonna be (mumbles). - Aw, they're so sweet. (thudding) (Tonya laughs) It's gonna be fun. - [Jimmy] Oh, we might do that. (Tonya laughs) (door slams) - Hey, man, thanks for taking us out on the water. - My pleasure. Anything to get out on a boat, you know? - Yeah, my dad, when I was little, he used to have a boat, so he would take us out all the time. - Oh, those are good memories. What kind of boat did he have? - A Boston Whaler. - Now that's a good boat. (Samantha laughs) - Absolutely, yeah. - That's a good boat. - Is it good? - That's a great boat. - I know nothing about boats. I apologize, I am not a boat guy. - That's all right, we'll still take you out. Let's make some new memories. - (laughs) Yeah. - New memories, I love it. - Thanks, Jack. - Shall we? - Let's do it. - Let's go. - Thank you. (upbeat music) Hey, you guys. - Hey. - Hey. You two kids had fun out of your boat ride? - Yes, I had a lot of fun. - Yeah. - Why doesn't Ryan look like he had that much fun? - No, it's, it was good, yeah. - He just hasn't developed his sea legs yet. - Wouldn't it be ocean legs? - (laughs) I'm fine, let's not talk about what I haven't developed yet, thank you. (both laughing) What are you guys doing? (Tonya laughs) - We had a very productive and wonderful day. - Yeah, it looks like you guys have been doing math all day. It's good. (both laughing) - So are you guys, you're gonna just stand there or are you gonna sit and join us? (chattering) (Tonya laughing) - Come on. - I mean, it's only two. - Yeah, but it's five o'clock somewhere. - That's the spirit. (both laughing) - Well, besides we're on vacation, guys. - I'm good. - Who cares? - I'll just have a mineral water for now, thank you, yeah. Thank you. (upbeat music) - The ocean breeze feels nice. - Do you know what I think we should do? - What's that? - Grab drinks. (Tonya laughs) - Of course you do. (Jimmy giggles) - Well, we walked past a cute place on the way here. - Let's do it. - Cool. (techno music) - So do you guys live here or are on vacation? - Oh no, we're just down the street at my parents' beach house for the weekend. - For a few days. - So how do you know each other? - College. - College. - Yeah, we all went to Clemson together. - Yeah. - Nice. - Do you remember, Stevie? - Arm clam? - Yeah. (grunting) (cheering) - Yes. (laughing) - Wow! - Did that just happen? - That-(chattering) (laughing) - Oh exciting (mumbles). - [Samantha] Oh, well congratulations on graduating. - Thank you. - Thanks. - Yes, we're just celebrating. We appreciate the drinks, by the way. - Yes. - Yeah, so much. - Absolutely. - How long have you guys been together? - Since sophomore year. - Yeah, sophomore year. Almost two years, yeah. - Yeah. - You guys are so cute. - [Woman] How long have you guys been together? - About two months. - Two months. - Yeah. - Aw. - [Man] So now, hey? - Wow, it's so new. - Two great ones. - How about y'all? - Five. - Five? - Five years, yeah. - Wow. - Five years, wow, good for you. - That's like forever. - Thank you, thank you very much. - That's awesome. - We're very happy. - Yeah. - And it's... yeah. (man laughs) - I'm glad, yeah, us too, man. - Yeah, we are. - When's the wedding? Come on, when is the wedding? - Shut up. (all laughing) (chattering) - Oh, well. - No, we're still (Ryan laughs) figuring some things out. - Yeah. - Yeah? - But you know. - But? - No pressure. - No. - No, but it's (mumbles). (chattering) Thank you, though. - I just got off the- (Tonya laughs) - Babe, I wanna get some snacks. - Okay, get me a drink while you're there. Yeah, so where are y'all from originally? - I'm from New York. - From New York. - [Man] Yeah, we both are, we went to high school together. - Yeah. - We kinda stuck side by side throughout, so long we've gone- - You guys. - To the same place. - Yeah, yeah. - Hey, Sam, you need something? - Hey, I thought maybe you might want some help. - Ah, well thanks. (Samantha sighs) - Is everything okay with Ryan? He seems very uptight right now. Is everything okay with him? - Yeah, he's probably just weirded out from work or something. Maybe he's upset to have all these people here. - Oh, okay. Because he just seems so tense unlike you who's always having a good time. (laughs) - What can I say? I'm a fun guy. - (laughs) Yeah. - I don't know. Hmm, probably my fault. - Really? It's not anything that he's not telling me from work or you know, maybe he tells you something more than me? - He would know better. He just, I think it's all the people I invited over. - Okay. - (sighs) All right. - [Samantha] Well, I am going to take these out there. - All right. - Thank you. (lips smacking) (insects call) (yawning) - Jimmy, your girl passed out. - [Jimmy] True. (laughs) - (laughs) How could she fall asleep? It's so early still. - She's adorable, though. - Yeah. - (yawns) I'm exhausted. - You're tired too? - I'm going to bed. - Okay. - [Ryan] You coming? - Not yet, I'll be in soon though. - Yeah? - Mhm, yeah, enjoy the night. - Okay. - Good night, brother. - [Ryan] Good night, Jimmy. (door squeaks) (Jimmy sighs) (door squeaks) (Jimmy sighs) - So what's up, Sam? Everything good? - I was just thinking. - Yeah? About what? - Have you ever wondered what would have happened if things were different? - Different, how? - I don't know, just different. - (sighs) I guess. I'm pretty content with the way things are for me, so. - (chuckles) That day at the bar, five years ago, you came up to me, but you never asked for my number. - (laughs) What are you talking about? - I still remember meeting you before Ryan that day at the bar. Why didn't you ask me out? Things would have been a lot different then. - Different, how? - (sighs) What if we were supposed to get together and this would have been our vacation and we would have done all these amazing activities and just live through the moment. - I don't know, but you're with Ryan. So everything worked out well. - Yeah, Ryan is great. He's stable and I feel very secure with him and I know that he'll be there for me if I ever need him, whatever, whenever, he would be there. - Exactly. - But you are so much more impulsive, you know, you're definitely not boring. - But you'll only see me for bits and pieces so you think that about me, I mean- - Oh, I've seen you enough. - Oh geez, Sam. (laughs) - I just know you're the type of guy who just wants to have fun and live through the moment and (laughs) is funny and doesn't take himself too seriously. - This is true, but you know, I mean, things are good, so. (sighs) I think I better get this one to bed. There's something about Tonya, she just falls asleep anywhere, but a bed. (feet pattering) - Good morning. - [Jimmy] Oh, hey, good morning. (groans) - Where's Tonya? - Still sleeping. - Oh, so is Ryan. (chuckles) - So, how's it going? - Oh, I feel okay today. I still remember what we talked about last night, if that's what you're asking. - (sighs) Yeah, I was really drunk last night, I don't remember much, so. - Are you going for a morning swim? - Yeah, I was thinking about it. - Hm. (sighs) (Samantha exhales) Are you dressed for the water? - No, not yet. - Well, we can always go skinny dipping. - (sighs) Fuck it. - I mean, Dad, we're living together. It's great, I love her. I'm working hard for us, for what we're building. I mean, it's only been five years, so- (Dad laughs) What? - What is it? What, I don't even understand your generation. It's only been five years? Mate do you know where me and your mother were five years in our relationship? You were almost in preschool and your sister was already almost out of diapers. That's where we were in five years. I don't understand this, honestly, this idea that you're just living this kind of pre-life before you're gonna live the life. All right? So what, where do you want to be? Where do you want to be? You can't just keep kind of circling around. You gotta land it. (taps) You gotta ask yourself, is this what I want? Do I want a family? Do I want that kind of future? - I have a plan. - Uh-huh. - I always have a plan. And this plan is about going there. I'm not afraid of it, it's just a matter of, I want to make sure I have my ducks in a row before we take that step, and- - All right, I'm gonna tell you, listen to me very carefully. This is important information. You're never gonna have your ducks in a row. You're never gonna have the money you think you need. You're never gonna have the job you think you must have. You're never gonna have any of that stuff. All you're ever gonna have is a certain amount of time and then you don't. Do you understand? I'm not even talking about you and her. I'm talking about me, you, your mother, all of us. You gotta live life when it's presented to you, 'cause you could walk outta here, no offense, and get hit by a bus. So why don't you just start thinking about where do you want to be tomorrow. Not where you want to be in 10 years. It is time to shit or get off the pot. I don't know how else to put it. (Ryan yawns) - (chuckles) I way overdid it last night. - (laughs) Yeah, you were pretty hammered. - Oh, my God, I haven't been hung over like this in a long time. (laughs) - Yeah, we can't drink like we were in our twenties. - No, I was reminded of that the hard way. (Ryan sighs) - You wanna get some breakfast, some water to kinda help you with that feeling? - Mm, sounds good. - Okay, I'm gonna get dressed. - Okay. (smacks lips) (Ryan sighs) (Tonya giggles) (Tonya mumbles) - Good morning! (Ryan groans) - How do you feel today? - (laughs) I couldn't get up this morning. I missed our morning swim. - I couldn't get up either. - (laughs) I drank way too much. - You know the feeling. Well, at least Samantha was able to go with Jimmy on his morning swim. - Hm, and is the swim as refreshing as Jimmy says? - Yeah, it was. - Cool, well, it's always good to try new things. Maybe you and I go swimming later, huh? - Mhm, sure. - Yeah? - Are you hung over at all? - No, I actually feel okay. (laughs) - That was pretty impressive. - Yeah. - Like passed out last night. - [Samantha] I know you did. - (laughs) It's like so embarrassing to be like that person, - No. (laughs) - but you know, it's fun, we're on vacation, whatever. - Yeah, Jimmy was very sweetie. He puts you to bed. - I know, now cooking me breakfast, gosh! (laughs) - Yeah. - Oh, that's a good boyfriend, nice work. - Thank you. (laughs) (Tonya laughs) Yeah I'm all right. What can I say? - You guys, I am like so tired. (laughs) Like losing my voice. (Samantha laughs) You guys seriously wearing me out. - Especially you, babe. - Did you have fun? - I feel good. - I can't believe tonight's our last night here. What do you guys wanna do? - I vote we drink. - (laughs) Of course you do. - I second drinking. - Oh, okay, - Oh, okay, we're drinking - Well, I don't know if my liver can take it, but I think we're out of booze, so. - Yeah, I know we're all out of booze. (Tonya laughs) - I was going to maybe go and get some, get some other things at the store. Anyone need anything? - Oh, I actually need a few things. - Oh yeah? - Mind if I come with you? I can just like hop into the convenience store on the way. - Babe, that cool? - No, that's fine. - Yeah? - Yeah, do what's you gotta do. - You wanna go now? All right. - Sure. I'll just go get my purse. - Okay, babe. (lips smack) - See ya. - [Jimmy] (sighs) See you later. - [Tonya] Thank you. (Samantha sighs) (Jimmy sighs) (doors slam) - Hey, so I'm glad we had a chance to be alone. - Yeah? - I want to get your opinion on something. - Oh, yeah of course, shoot. - Cool. (engine humming) (gentle music) - So are we gonna talk about this morning? - Talk about what? How much you enjoyed that? - Yeah, I don't know, Sam. - (exhales) I know you feel it, Jim. Things just seem right between you and I. I'm wasting my time with Ryan, and you with Tonya. We should be together. - Yeah, but it's just, I don't know. Timing's really tough and- - Timing? You're never going to be ready for anything in life and I wanna be happy. Don't you have feelings for me? - (sighs) You know I do. - Yeah, and I feel very strongly for you too. - (sighs) I don't know, Sam. It's just, it's, it's- - What? - It's tough, it's- - If you didn't want to, you wouldn't have followed me in the water today. - Yeah. - Right? - You're right. - So that's a sign. - You're right, but I don't know if, do you think that was the right thing? Not like this, not behind Ryan's back. - In the grand scheme of things, what's the difference when it happens? (lips smacking) - All right, fuck it. (Jimmy groans) (Dad laughs) - What? - I just figured out what exactly this is about. You're actually, I'm, no, it's great. You're gonna ask fatherly advice. It's been a long time since you have and I'm so glad, honestly, buddy. So are you gonna propose or not? - Yes. (Dad laughs) (slaps) - That's great. - I love her. - All right then do it, that's great. See? That's my boy, yes. You gotta grab life. It's in front of you, do it, do it. (Ryan sighs) - [Tonya] So are you going to do it after the two of you get back? - Yeah, I love her and I can't imagine my life without her. - That is so sweet. - Oh, please don't say anything. - (scoffs) I wouldn't, don't worry. - [Ryan] Thanks. - Of course. Oh my gosh, she's gonna be so excited. - [Ryan] I know, right? She's not gonna see this coming. - [Tonya] Mm-mm. - We should run away together. - Yeah. - Just get up and go. - Let's do it. (Samantha laughs) - Okay, let's go tomorrow. - Okay. - Why don't we wake up before everybody wakes up because I don't wanna deal with Ryan and he's gonna be so brokenhearted. So we'll go to my place and we'll get my stuff - Yes. - and then we'll go to yours, your place. And then we'll just go. - Okay, where are you thinking? - LA. - Yeah. (laughs) - It doesn't matter, but let's meet tomorrow at 9:00 AM before everybody gets up at the Tiki bar. - This is gonna work, Sam. - I think it's gonna be great. And then we'll just go from there. We'll start a whole new life. - Yes. - I think we can do it. It's gonna be amazing. - That's good, just you and me. (glass clinking) - [Ryan] There we go, wow. - That's good. - That's a lotta stuff. - Hey, guys. - Top of the Iceberg. - How's it going? - How was the store? - [Tonya] It was good. - Did you find anything? - It was great. - It was actually really nice to get to hang out - It was- - with Ryan so much. I see why he's your best friend. - Good. - It was nice. (Jimmy sighs) It was fun. You wanna start drinking? I know that's what you said you wanted to do, so. - All right. - Yeah, that's actually a really good idea. - Yeah, I do. Yeah, definitely. - [Tonya] Last week, guys. Go big or go home, and we're going home tomorrow, so. - Yes. - You know the rest. Let's do it, (laughs) okay. (upbeat music) (door knocking) (Samantha inhales sharply) - [Ryan] Hey, Sam, you're ready for the beach? - Yeah, I'll be ready in two minutes. (Samantha exhales) (slow music) (feet shuffling) (door clicks) - [Tonya] Gee, where is the Casa? (rustling) - So how are you feeling, bro? - (smacks lips) Good, just, have you noticed something weird? Sam doesn't seem weird to you somehow? - I didn't pick up on anything. (rattling) - Is everything okay? - Yeah, yeah why wouldn't it be? - You seem very quiet. (rattling) - Have you ever just stopped to think about your life and where it's going? - I'm not following. - Like you thought you wanted one thing and then you realize that that's not what you really wanted? - Is everything okay with you and Ryan? He's crazy about you, you know? - I love Ryan, I really do, but it just gets really tiring to know that every step we're planning. - As opposed to what? Not knowing if he's gonna come home at night or wondering if he even cares about you (Samantha scoffs) or is just with you for other reasons? - No, I know that Ryan loves me and that he'll always be there for me and he's reliable and he's loyal, but I just don't know if there's any excitement there, if that's enough. I mean, look at you and Jimmy. - (laughs) Yeah, Jimmy, he's a lot of fun. I mean, he's cool to hang out with and he's cool to party with. And like the sex is good, but there's not much more to it than that. It's no different than having a sex buddy that you kinda like sometimes. - But you two seem so happy together. - Yeah, we seem that way in front of other people, but honestly, most nights we have nothing to really say to each other. (laughs) Two months in, and we've already said everything there is to say. Do you and Ryan still talk? - Every night. - Look, Jimmy, (sighs) he might seem like he's a lot of fun, but if I was ever in a jam, I don't know if he'd even be there for me. And I know that if something really bad happened, he wouldn't. (laughs) Great, don't get me wrong, being with Jimmy is, (chuckles) it's a constant party, but every party comes to an end sometime. Ryan, he is always there for you, no matter what. He would walk to the end of this earth for you and he would be there for you until your last breath. That's the kinda guy you wanna end up with, not a guy like Jimmy, who's the first one to do a keg stand. (Samantha laughs) Okay, like, yeah, that was cool when we were in college, but not when we're thirties and an adult. - So you would rather safe and boring? - (laughs) Any day. I look at you and Ryan and I'm honestly jealous. (Samantha scoffs) You might think things are stale, but they're just getting started for the two of you. You guys have a beautiful future ahead and you know that he loves you. He would be there for you no matter what. And he's stable. (Samantha laughs) That's the kinda guy you wanna end up with. You're not gonna find much better than that. - (exhales) Thank you. - Yeah. All right, let's bring them their snacks. - Okay. (sniffles) (Samantha sobs) - Okay? - Mhm. - Okay. (Jimmy sniffles) - Hey guys, we got you some snacks. - Ooh, snacks. - That looks nice. - Nice. - Thank you. - I moved you? (Samantha giggles) - Hey! (lips smacking) - Hello. - Hello. (Tonya sighs) - How are you? - I'm good. - Okay, so what went wrong with Mom, what happened? - So, she never told you? - No. - Well, it's funny. I figured that's why you never wanted to come over. (sighs) All right. So, look, I'm like any other guy, you know, I'm out there in the world trying to do my best for the family. Opportunities present themselves, opportunities that you should not take. I hurt your mother. I hurt your mother and she could never forgive me. And I'm not mad at her 'cause she didn't, but I'm not proud of it, but that's the life I've chosen. So you know, in your life, people let you down, that's just human nature. (sighs) Do you forgive? Do you forget? I don't know. All I've thought about is how I could have just not made those same decisions. Your mother's happy, you're happy, your sister's happy. I live alone and I'm miserable. People change, I think I could have made it work. I really do. I've missed you, I've missed having you around and Carolyn. Anyway, come around more, okay? Don't just come when you need advice. Maybe sometimes I need advice, (laughs) maybe you would have told me not to buy this stupid house. (laughs) Come on. (taps) (Tonya groans) - All right, I'm gonna call it a night. See you all in the morning. - Good night. - All right, good night. - You know what? I'm exhausted too. You wanna go? - Yeah, I'll be right there, it's late. - Yeah. (Ryan groans) - [Jimmy] Hey, I'll meet you at the Tiki bar at 9:00 AM. (Samantha groans) (Samantha exhales) (Samantha groans) (drawer clicking) (gentle music) (box clicking) - Wow (laughs), whatever you're making, I don't wanna know, (Ryan laughs) but wow! - You like it? I love it, so here's what you do. (box clicks) That's what I did with your mom. You put that in your pocket and you carry it with you all the time and you're gonna know when you're supposed to give it to her. You understand? - What can I get ya? - I'm just gonna do a black coffee, brother. - Coming up. - So I think things are gonna be done with me and Jimmy when we get back. - Why? - I'm sorry to hear that. - It's like, he's fun, he's amazing, but he's not exactly like husband material, you know? I got a list and (laughs) he hasn't quite meet them except for fun to hook up with, he meets that one. (laughs) - Wow! - But I think he's gonna be fine. - Yeah. - Hey, man, I should have asked your earlier, are you Jimmy? - Yeah, I'm Jimmy. - So a girl came by earlier, she left a note for ya, asked if I could give it to ya. (taps) (paper rustling) (gentle music) (Jimmy sniffles) (paper rustling) (Jimmy sighs) (paper rustling) - So yeah, we'll be fine. - Yeah, you deserve someone great. - Yeah, thank you. - And someone who'll - Well, hopefully - support you. - I can find, you know, my Ryan one day. (Samantha laughs) - That would be nice. - Thank you. - I think we're almost there. (Samantha mumbles) - Yeah? - Mhm. - [Ryan] All right, let me see. - [Samantha] Don't forget my bag. - We can't, believe me (mumbles) my staff in. (Samantha laughs) (Jimmy sniffles) Sorry about that. (Samantha laughs) - Yeah and we'll go. - Yeah. (door squeaks) - Hey, just loaded my bag in the car. I think we should all head out now to beat the traffic. - [Tonya] Yeah, let me grab my bag. - (sniffles) All right. - Yeah, should we- - Yeah, we should beat the traffic home - Yeah, I think so too. - I think. (couch creaks) (Ryan groans) (Jimmy sniffles) (upbeat music) (slaps) (Jimmy sniffles) (Jimmy sniffles) - Fuck! Fuck! (taps) Fuck! (Jimmy sniffles) (Jimmy sobs) (Jimmy sniffles) Fuck! (Jimmy cries) - You signed off on that settlement report? - I did. Still think we could have done better had we gone to court. - Think about how many more billable hours that would have been just for a little bit more. - I was thinking about billable hours. (Frank laughs) (both laughing) Peterson didn't want to go to trial, and I think we got a great settlement. - You, my friend, are a shark. - Oh, sorry, but I gotta go, Frank. - You're leaving before we're done here? - (laughs) It's date night with Samantha and I'm not gonna be late. - Good luck. - Thanks. Hey. - Hey, babe. You're home early. (lips smacking) - I told you I wasn't gonna miss date night. - Okay, well I'm just finishing up getting dinner ready. - Okay, I'm gonna pour myself a drink and get out of your hair. - Okay, I'll let you know when it's finished. - Cool, thanks. (pot clanking) Hey, Samantha, can you come in here for a second? (pot clanking) (suspense music) (upbeat music) - Whatever you decide, stand by your choice and never look back.
