Could be. Don’t you think? Could be. Good morning, Mr. Tornillo. Good morning. I’m so excited because you got here just in time. Everything is ready, everything is set, especially our models. Where are your models? They’re here, and they’re ready. I’m so excited because our pictures will surely be trending. Girls, let’s go. Shall we? Let’s go. You might forget this. Goodbye. Take care of the messenger later. Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it. Just a moment sir, there’s some dust. Goodbye. Take care, sir. Your mouth – I know what you’re going to say. Visit me, I’ll serve you pancit canton. You’ll serve noodles? You’re getting excited again. Dinah! Am I paying you to gossip? You, wherever you came from – go back to it. You— I told you to do something. Should I be the one to finish it? Get inside! What are you gossiping about? What are you doing? It has to be more sexy. Sexy! More sexy! More! We’re selling condoms. Make it sexier! Look here! You should be sexy! More sexy! Sexier! More wild! Nice. Very nice! Are you okay, Frankie? Yeah, I’m good. We’re selling condoms, not a memorial park, my goodness. Okay, change pose. Charlene, Victoria, get Andrew between the two of you. Fight over him. Clash into him. Wilder! The boss wants more wild! Yes! That’s it! How can we sell condoms with lousy marketing? Wilder! There you go! More! More! There! I like it! That’s the kind of kiss I like later, okay? There! Yes! Wilder! Yes, that’s it! Do it better! Shall we do solo shots? Sure. May I go to the washroom? It’s okay. I’ll have to adjust the lights. Sure. We’ll first work with Charlene. What about you? Don’t you need to go? Maybe later. Why not now? Alright. Solo shots, Charlene. Center, please. What was that? Didn’t I tell you, later? You want to rush things. So, what are you looking at? What’s happening? Back to work! Miss Victoria? Miss Victoria? Are you in there? They need you. Your shots are up next. We’re not done yet. Yes? Miss Victoria, I’m sorry. But they need you now. It’s alright. Thank you. Have you seen Andrew? I wonder where he went. Ah, he probably got thirsty. He could have just asked for some water. Let’s go. You had an affair with your boss, and “that’s the way it is?” But that’s how it is, Papa Dax. I really can’t explain. The affair with my boss just happened. How could it “just happened”? You tripped, is that it? Lost your wits? Then woke up, and suddenly you’re with your boss? It’s not that simple. Of course, not all of a sudden. You got me confused, sister. You said it just happened, but not all of a sudden? What if the wife of your boss finds out? That will mean the pits for you. That’s precisely my problem, Papa Dax. If she finds out, she will throw me out. That will be the end of my relationship with my boss. Why? You think your affair with your boss is going anywhere? Sister, he has a wife. You’re a househelp. Tell me the truth. Your boss was your first, right? And you found pleasure. So now you can’t help it. You’re craving for it. Why? Is he as big as a cucumber? That’s far too big! I couldn’t handle that, Papa Dax! Maybe more like— an eggplant. A big one. I knew it. You’re craving for it. Put a stop to it. That won’t get anywhere. He’s your boss! He surely still treats you as an employee, maybe even his property. Ma’am, will you still have dinner? Shall I reheat the sour stew? No need. We’ll go up now. We’ll have dinner in the room. You can lock-up now. Surely, you know how? Yes, Ma’am. Your housemaid? A new one– I’ve had her for a few days. From Samar. Let’s finish this. I haven’t even started. Good morning. Good morning, sir. Will you have breakfast now? No, thank you. Not even a cup of coffee? I’m fine. I’m leaving now Okay, sir. Can you open the door? Oh, just a moment. I’m sorry. I’m new here. I’m not used to this yet. You’ve also just begun working as a housema— —a househelp? No, I’ve worked for others before. You don’t look like a housema— —a househelp. What should a househelp look like? Oh! The gate. Look, I’m sorry. It’s just— You seem smart. Did you earn a degree? I didn’t finish high school. My father died when I was in Third Year. We fell into debt. But this is your first job? Is it? No. With my first employer, my male boss made advances. He wouldn’t let me be. I got so frightened, I quit. So, what happened to your debts? Did you pay them back? Not yet. I worked for other employers. Then what happened? You got courted again? Yes. So, what did you do, give in finally? You gave in to your boss? Was he handsome? He was kind. If my female employer would be mad at me, he would console me. He made me feel better. And then? His wife sent me away. Why? If you weren’t doing anything— Ah, he caught the two of you in the act? So that’s why you work for a female boss now? My mother requested it from the agency. You told your mother what happened with you and your boss? Of course, not. All that she knows is that my female employer wanted to be rid of me. But my mother still blamed me, calling me a tease, of that I gave my boss a reason— Don’t worry. It will be our secret. Have you been with madam for some time? You mean Victoria? No, we were just introduced yesterday, at the pictorial. What’s your name? Eva. It’s Eva. I’m Andrew. Thank you, Eva. You know what Eva, I’m not really surprised at what you had to go through. You’re temptation itself. Your name alone proves it. It’s probably good that you’re now working for a woman. Hey! Lauro! What are you doing? I made it very clear to you – I leave early today, you need to clean the car at once! What were you doing last night that made you wake up late? Were you masturbating all through the night? Answer me! You see…. -What? What are you saying? I can’t hear you! I can’t make up my mind whether you’re deaf or truly inept! Clean the car! Do it quickly or I’ll be late for my appointment! Yes sir. Eva— Yes ma’am? Ma’am? Come inside. Good morning, Ma’am. Has Andrew left? Yes, ma’am. Was I too loud last night? I’m sorry? What was it? Get used to it. I’m truly a screamer. Did you preparebreakfast? -Yes, ma’am. What did you prepare? -Sausage and egg, ma’am. What did you say? I can’t hear you. Sausage and egg. That was what I had for dinner. Shall I bring it up? No need. I’ll come down for it. Ah! Sorry! I didn’t mean to startle you. I’m Larry. You won’t find anyone as good-looking in the whole village. What about you, what’s your name? But your boss calls you Lauro, right? Don’t call me Lauro. It sounds so old. Just call me Larry. Don’t call me Lauro. It sounds so old. Just call me Larry. Don’t call me Lauro. It sounds so old. Just call me Larry. You’re new here, right? I only saw you yesterday. I’ve just been here for a few days. How’s your employer? Is she kind? Seems so. And yours? Gets mad easily. His blood often boiling. I noticed. He’ll just keel over one day. He’s a mental case. Couldn’t find anyone to dump on but me. He is loud. So is your boss, she’s loud too. Nights mostly. I can hear her from my room. Really? Yes! I enjoy it really! Just like porn, but without video. That’s why I know it when she has someone with her in her room. When I start hearing her grunts and shouts— What? Here, I’ll show you. Lauro! Get yourself here! Lauro! Yes sir! Coming! Let’s talk again, shall we? LAURO! -On my way! What are you looking for? Nothing, really. I’m leaving. Please open the gate. Yes, ma’am. Don’t wait up for me tonight. I have my keys. Yes. ma’am. Please clean my room. -Ma’am? I said, clean my room. Even if you find anything to steal there, you’re not a thief, are you? Yes, ma’am... -Bye. No, ma’am. Vegetables! Eggplants of Mang Kanor! Okra for lubrication. Neneng’s pechay! Eggplants of Mang Kanor! Okra for lubrication. Come and get your vegetables, every all, because we will have a raffle later on. Come buy and buy. -Hello Manang. Buy. Hello! -Hello. You’re the new girl from that house, right? Yes. I’m Desiree. I’m a nanny from that house with the pink gate. This is Dinah. She’s from the house next to yours. Eva. -Eva. Here’s Adam. Dinah! -Manang. You haven’t bought anything. Buy something! Don’t just gawk there. Have a feel for what you want. I want to see if it’s hard enough. What about you, girl? Do you like eggplants? There so much you can do with it. Manang! You’re lewd! Lewd? But it’s true. You can make omelet with it. You can grill it… Grill it, did you hear? Not flipped. Don’t listen to them. You might become like them, poor you. Why, what are we? You have enjoyed your lives. Better that we enjoyed, rather than soiled. And the one who isn’t soiled dares to speak. It’s true, Manang. My boyfriend is a seaman. We have a long-distance relationship. So you have use for my eggplants after all? Oh, I don’t go for that. I’d rather wait til my boyfriend gets back. Then, one-time, big-time. For your one time-big time, you go like this. Stop it! What about you? You want these, right? Don’t bother asking her. She’s not barren at all. She gets watered regularly, though the connection’s illegal. I hope she’s not found out, or else the tubes will be cut and the water stops dripping. That’s not true. You’re babbling about so many things. What about you? Have you decided what you want to do with my eggplants? Look at my eggplants. Eva! Eva! Eva! DUNGAW performed by: FRANKY OCAMPO Eva! Eva! DUNGAW performed by: FRANKY OCAMPO Eva! Why? What are you doing? What are you doing? My boss might see you! Sshh! DUNGAW performed by: FRANKY OCAMPO What are you doing? Go away! Go away now! I will shout. I will call for help. Eva? Come up here. Eva? Coming! Did you prepare breakfast? Yes, ma’am. Prepare for two. Bring them up. Yes, ma’am. Come here. I’m having breakfast brought up. Don’t bother. Did you really clean the car? How come the tires are still dirty? You’re really good-for-nothing! I don’t know why I still keep you! You are useless! Eva, I’ve been calling for you. Ma’am, sorry, I didn’t hear. When I call you, answer and come at once. Is that clear? Yes, ma’am. Bring up some water. We’ve run out of it upstairs. Do you still need anything? None for now. Eva! Eva! What are you doing here again? I’d like to say sorry. For what? For last night? I got carried away with… you know. You liked it too, didn’t you? Wait a minute, Lauro. Larry… Lauro. First, there’s nothing between us. I don’t even know why I let you do what you did last night. It’s simply because you can’t help yourself because you met a good-looking guy like me. If you repeat what you did, I’ll tell my boss about it, maybe even your boss. Wait, easy. I have no evil plans. It’s the fault of your boss. And yours too— because you’re too pretty. I get carried away. Please do forgive me. Eva! Where are you? -Go now! See me again tonight. -I told you to leave! Please, tonight. Fine! Just leave. Eva, where the hell are you? I went to open the gate because I know you’re leaving. Let’s go. In Kuwait, Filipina overseas worker Nadia Ismail has been charged with murder for killing her employer. In her sworn statement, Nadia accused her employer of raping her one day that her employer’s wife and their children were away. After the alleged incident, Nadia stabbed her employer, a Kuwaiti national, several times. Eva! Eva! Eva! Your boss isn’t here yet? No. What did you want to say? Come on. Don’t be in a rush. Let’s talk. Madam might come. Come on. Why did you call me? As you know, about last night… You’re apologizing for what you did. Because, you see, you weren’t ready yet. Ready for what? You know… that we become “us”! How can we become “us”? Come on, don’t make it hard for me. You know I like you. And I hope you like me too. Even if I like to, did you even bother asking if it is you I want? No need to ask that as it’s clear you have a thing for me too. Lauro, can’t you be bothered to ask me, please? I will answer you truthfully. But don’t assume that you can simply get or use anyone anytime you want to. All right. Eva, Eva, I really like you. And then? That’s it. I like you. Do you like me, too? Yes. What? You like me, too? Then why did we have to go through all the motions. Even if I like you, I don’t want to be forced to do so. Of course not! I’m not forcing you. If you really like me, then “wow”! So, we’re together now. We’re “us” now. Maybe. And if we’re “us” now, may I— may I kiss you? See, I’m asking for your permission. What? You’re too much in a rush. It was you who was rushing earlier. Madam is here. You have to leave. I’ll woo you in earnest. Say yes at once. Go! Ma’am! -What was that? Nothing, ma’am. I thought there was something… You may go to bed after locking up the doors. Yes, ma’am. Good morning. Good morning, ma’am. You broke the yolk. Yes. Would you like me to cook another one? No need. That will be fine. I will leave again today. Don’t bother waiting up for me tonight. Yes, ma’am. Why are you here again? To woo you. Your boss isn’t here, right? I saw her leave earlier. What are those? Flowers. What for? Come on—they’re for you. And from where did you get these? Come on—you shouldn’t be asking those questions. You said you would woo me. Go ahead. You’re rushing again. You like me. Yes. And then, why? What did you mean why? What did you like about me? What did I like about you? What else? You. Just you. What else? What do you mean? What do you want to happen now? Hopefully, you like me too. Because I like you. I hope you would also like what I like. What is it that you want? I want... ..to get to be close to you. Like the other night? Well, yes. You went ahead with what you wanted witout even asking me first. Ask you? “Eva, may I kiss you?” That’s what you mean? You should’ve asked first. Ask how? If I had asked first, would you have said yes? Yes. If I had asked, “May I kiss you” you would’ve agreed? Yes. Eva, may I kiss you? Yes. DAHAN performed by: XAVIER X DAHAN performed by: XAVIER X Madam’s here. Wait. Hurry up. - Wait! - We might get caught. Hurry up! Wait! Please wait. Wait. Not here. Lauro, what are you doing!? I’ll see you tomorrow. Eva? Eva? What are you doing in my room? Who said you could use my bathroom? Your clothes are wet. You better change. Wear these. Looks good on you. Did you sleep soundly last night? I was calling for you this morning but you had no reply. Is there something I should know? I like someone who resists. I get more excited. Lauro! - Lauro! - What? My boss is here. He might hear you. I’d be done for. Listen carefully. You will come to my room tonight. I will be waiting. Do you understand? If you don’t show up, I will tell on you to my boss and to your boss. I will tell them you forced yourself into my room last night. I’ll show them the gashes on my hands and marks on my body. I will tell them you broke into my room. Maybe to steal. You will surely be arrested and imprisoned. It won’t only be invectives from your boss that you’ll have to bear. He might even beat you up. But you will surely lose your job. I will be waiting for you. Tonight. Get out of my house! You ingrate! I treated you well, yet you have the nerve to destroy my family! Don’t make me leave. This is the only job I know. You pretend to be all nice? You slut! What? Stop that. You’re creating a scandal. A scandal? What about what you did with this woman? Isn’t that a scandal? Have some shame. People are watching. Now you’re ashamed? Wait here. Enough, please. Enough. Were you hurt? I turned my back for a moment and you’re at it again? Hey, you listen to me! Enough. Let go of me! The moment I see your face again, I might kill you. I don’t want to see you ever again. Why do you have your hands on her? Leave! Get away from here! Eva! Here I am. What is it you want? I want you to answer my questions. What do you think I am? What am I to you? Do you see me as a woman to marry or someone to get off on? Didn’t I tell you I like you? And don’t you like me, too? If I get pregnant, will you take responsibility? Admit it, Lauro. Did you enjoy fucking me? Yes, of course. I didn’t. I was hurt with what you did. Why? What is it that you want? If you want a relationship based on lust, I’ll do it. I can accept that. But you can’t be the only one who gets pleasure. It’s not fair for you to be the only one who’s satisfied. It can’t be that we’d fuck only when you feel like it. Just like now. I want you to please me. I want to feel that you love me. I want to see that... I’m important to you. Is that all? Then let’s do it. Wait. Take your clothes off but stay there. Are you serious? Lie down. I said lie down. Don’t rush. Wait for me. Eva? Eva? I’m busy. Eva, I’ve been calling you. I’m still busy. Eva, when I call for you, whatever else you’re doing, stop it. Come here, come with me to my room. Come sit by my side. Why? Why don’t you want to come here? Come here beside me. Are you going to tell me to do something? Come closer and you’ll find out. - Is that an order? - Yes. I’m your boss, so I’m giving you an order. If you want me to do anything related to what I am employed to do in your house I have no right to refuse nor complain. I’m glad that you know it. But if what you want is a repeat of what happened between us yesterday, there’s something we need to make clear What is it? My body is mine. I am the only one who can decide what I want to do with my body. No one else. If something were to happen between us, it is because I want it, too. not simply because I am complying with your order. I like you. I want to be with you. I hope that is also something you want. Next time, if you want me to be in bed with you, you will have to come to my room And if you were the one who wanted it? I will tell you. I will be the one to come to your room. I have an idea. What is it? I’m not sure whether you’ll like it. Say it. Where are we going? Trust me, I’ll take care of you. What are we going to do? Your boss might catch us. That won’t happen. What is it? Come in. Stay there. Whatever happens now, it will be because that is what we want. Wait, wait. Why? Don’t you like it? Isn’t it every man’s fantasy to have a threesome with two women? Eva, believe it or not I love you, Eva. I want you for myself. And I hope you want me, too. Just for yourself. Not just sharing me between yourselves. Lauro! Is he stupid? He’s being given a blessing, yet he turns his back to it. He might have a point. What? I thought you were smart. I didn’t realize you’re just as stupid. He wasn’t talking about being smart. Then what? Lust? Heart? Love? Don’t tell me you’re actually in love with that idiot? Remember We had a deal. Lauro! Lauro! Lauro! Larry! Why? I don’t know, but... What? Did she force you? Or did you want it, too? Or are you confused with what you really wnat for yourself? What do you need to do? That your boss told you? It’s alright. I understand. If you don’t please your boss, you’ll be out of a job. You know what’s funny? I may actually be in love with you. Junjun! Where did that boy go? The latest on the case of Nadia Ismail a Filipina overseas worker charged with killing her employer who allegedly raped her. The spokesperson of the Philippine Embassy in Kuwait announced that they are doing everything to prove Nadia acted in self-defense against the transgressions of her employer. We will continue to follow this case later tonight. Why did you let him go? I’m sorry, Ma’am. I tried to hold on, but he broke free. Wait, Junjun is right there. He’s playing, making sandcastles. Mommy’s coming! Don’t follow her. Order drinks for us. Get water for Junjun. Order something for yourself. Thank you, sir. Pay with this. As for the change, keep it. Thank you. Sir, One orange juice, please. Sister, you’re in a difficult situation but I understand what you’re going through. Your male employer is kinder to you than the female. Because of it, you’re closer to him than to her. I don’t really know, and neither do you if he’s really just kind to you or he wants you for something else. If his intentions are good or bad, we can’t really know. But whatever it is, I’m sure it will turn out badly for you. It might not even be true, with no basis in fact the wife will likely become jealous of you. Or the husband might really take an interest in you. He will soothe you, be very nice to you even give you gifts. But in the end, it will still not be good for you. Because he is married. And no matter how you look at it, he’s there at the top, and you’re at the bottom. We’re at the bottom. If you can’t find a way to the top, I advise you to leave. Get away from them. Leave them. Find a new employer or a new job. Please charge this to Cottage One. Believe me, sister. I know. You can do it. Thank you. What did you get for yourself? Nothing. I didn’t want anything. What do you think? Could be. Could be, too. So, you’re sure of your decision? Don’t worry. I won’t take it against you. I understand. I told your boyfriend to ask permission from his boss. Say he has a family emergency. Maybe his boss was in a good mood because he followed you here. It was more difficult for me convince him that you love him, too. Did you know we only communicate over the fence? I was afraid you’d catch us. I’ll leave the two of you together and you can take the rest of the day off. Don’t want up for me or look for me.
