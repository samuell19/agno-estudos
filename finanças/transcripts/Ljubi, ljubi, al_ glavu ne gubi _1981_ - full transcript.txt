You are partying in a hotel like that It's just scary. The missus is breaking glasses... And fools around... If it wasn't for me, you would hit rock-bottom. You are full of primal instincts. You should feel ashamed. No wonder Maria is like you. Mister Zika (unintelligible mocking) Nice company you keep around. That would be enough! I'm sick of your abuse. I got drunk. so what?

For the Miss. How beautiful! No need for the change. All should know when Brother Zika is having a good time. Cheers! -Cheers Cheers! Oh my god! Come here! Cheers! Here I am! Mister Zika! Here I am! These are you my ladies. I don't know mom. I think you are only looking at one side of the story. And probably... Not probably, I am sure that dad has conservative view on life But it's your fault too... You accepted your submissive role in marriage and family. It's beautiful that I can speak openly like this to you. As with a friend. But things aren't as simple as you think. You'll see it too when you get married. When I get married, I won't let my husband see me as his property. People in marriage should be able to keep their individuality I listened carefully to what you said. And it's all nice and smart what you are saying,,, But you still don't understand a lot of things in life. There is something I definitely understand and feel. And that is that mom needs only little for everything to be okay. You didn't go on a date for years now. You're always justifying it with with work, But, let's be honest, you don't have the desire. My daughter has grown and she is lecturing me, Dad. So the deal is off for tonight? But Bobo, please understand. I have a chance to reconcile my parents. Tonight we are going on a dinner with some old friends. And if I'm not there, something may go wrong. You know? Okay, I'll go with my friends. and you call back when you finish your peace mission. Okay... Bobo, do you love me? Pfff But tell me... You know I don't like complicated sentences. Okay, tell me two words then. You. Love. Bye... Thank you very much. Let's see it. Ah, great. Thank you. How the time flies... Maria has grown into a fine woman, And I know here from when she was a baby. In a heart beat, 18 years have passed. It's weird how people change,,, We live in the same city and yet we never see each other. Well that ain't a reason to be sad now. We'll fix that, will we not my dear? Ceca is right. Lets change the subject to something more fun. Did I bite his finger when I was little? You wanted to steal my chocolate. You must have been a cheapskate then. How he cried. -She only had two tooths. Give me the hat! Give me back the hat! Lets go to the bar. -Lets go Go! That's how it is done by Zika. My grandfather played domino for nothing . But his grandson lived to ripoff these foreigners. No bets, please. 18, red. 11 and a half milions 5 plus 6 Mister Zika. We have played enough. -You, shut up. Don't mister Zika me now. Zika is classy even when he loses and wins.

I'll never forget it. You drink a lot my friend, let me tell you... I'll waste my whole pay for one night here. What pay? How big is yor pay? 15 whole? -What whole? Millions. 15 millions? 4 times your pay brother Zika spent. As if they never existed. But classy. With two German girls... Two? -Two. Very stupid... It ain't stupid but it is expensive. But the two where... And what did you do with them two? -How do you mean what did I do? I go into her room... And then Antonio jumped me! And that Antonio? Was he her, you know... Antonio, who? The one that jumped you. It's not what you think, Antonio is with Cleopatra. And he come to Gizi to keep her safe. Gizi? -Gizi You just say it and she does it. I also know one Gizi. Girl, give a round. Double. You know nothing my friend. -And you know? Of course, I know. I've experienced a lot in my life. From scum to high society. The highest level in a hotel. "A" category. Hell... 120 thousand daily. Multiplied by three... And you do the math my friend... Plus boat, plus casino.... Plus the puppies... And you got nothing back? My dear friend... What will my dear Dara tell me? Bank savings account is empty. Who is that Dara now? My Dara... My beautiful Dara... My sunshine. Daro, Daro... My pearl... Daro, Daro... My sunshine. I come back to you... To be my only love... We will live... Like two doves... Daro, Daro My pearl... I am coming back to you... To be my beloved one... We will live as tw- Shh! ...two doves. Dar- My friend, why are disturbing the public order? See, my friend, how these people are? They don't understand my love woes. I even picked a bouquet of flowers and... For that bouquet you will pay a special fine. How can I pay? I'm broke. You know what friend, I have an idea... You take me home... ...then my Dara will pay you. Deal? Leave me out of your plans. I don't have time to babysit you. Now go home and don't let this happen again. Understood? My friend, my brother Please don't do that to me! Either you go home or I will pull out my fine notes. Well... Don't pull him out... I am going home. Good morning! Mister Zika. Get in! Now! Lady Elza. People can't live alone Maria. They need to have friends. And with that comes obligation to those people. I don't understand you. Few days you insisted on it. I did bu- -You know many of my friends are Directors, doctors, millionaires... People need to have a position in society. After all, if we took the precautions you wouldn't be in love with some simpleton Bobo. He couldn't even get into a college. You two are talking again the same story. What does your social status have to to with me? And frankly, I am too young to think about it. And as for Bobo not everybody need to go to college A lot of young people think like you and then they later regret it. How about Ceca's son? A beautiful boy and smart. Is a great student too. Because of all that I don't want to go out with you anymore. I love Bobo because he isn't perfect like that. Not only did you go with those two... May God have mercy... You're a man and maybe I could turn a blind eye. But you spent all our money till the last coin. And to do it know, when the prices of everything are going up. Leave it be Daro. That isn't even our money. Then whose are they? Tell me? Whose? Capitalistic. You see it on the TV. Everybody is talking about stability. And there is work for brother Zika. I'll earn money. And the you will see what life is... When brother Zika is stabilized. Till Zika gets stabilized, Daro should work. Well no more I say! Dara isn't naive anymore. No brother Zika, No! Isn't it so my dear? -Daro, Daro my sun! I bought 200g of coffee on this shortage and 3kg of detergent. Do you know how much I paid for that under the counter? Daro please here me. Daro! Daro be sensible. You are an intelligent woman, You never was a cheapskate Daro... While I was out, you where always on my mind, One night while I was thinking about you I feel from a tree. You don't believe it? Here. Here you go Daro... Corpus Delicates... Look at it. What are you smiling at, you plonker? Hi dad, welcome back. Good to be back... Was it at least classy? As it befits me... Look at him. He looks like he is going to die. You little fu- What? You are starting again? You raised him like that. Is this how he welcomes his father? -SIlence! Shut up, it's your fault.you know. You are a great role model. I'll turn my life's next page... I'll beat him to a pulp. Good day -Good day, good day! Pavlovic Slobodan. -That is for my Bobo. Thank you. -Goodbye What is ti now?đ Didn't we discuss everything already? - I don't care about your German girls and money. Than... A call to enlist in the army! My dear son. Daro... Fuckin' This is not a reason to cry. This is for celebrating Daro! Bobo, my son. Where is daddies soldier? Guys cheers! Maria? - I'll manage for myself! And I am volunteering to be Maria's bodyguard. You see that? -Wait a second, how do you mean bodyguard? Well... (laughter) New wheel of fortune New luck. For some bigger, for some smaller. No worries. What is? Why are you so loud? Our friend is going to serve in the military service. Who is that lucky guy? Boba! He is always first in everything. You are the one? You are going to army? Mister Mige drink something, my treat!

You already started hanging out with old friends. Now you have the opportunity to do it freely. Bobo, why don't you trust me? No, I'm just saying,,, Nothing can surprise us. Good day. -Hi Hi, Ceca. Hi- Good day, my lady. Hi Milane -Hi! Sorry the places is in a mess. We are having problems with the bathroom. The handyman is reparing it so... Well the handyman always leave a mess, no?

And what does that have to do with us? How do you mean it doesn't? Well I know that... Maria and Boba are in love. And when he comes back from the army... They shoud get... Settled. It's a custom after all. Isn't it so my dear? Milane! -You, shut up! Now listen closely... You can forget about your primitve combinations And please leave our lives finally please! Handyman,,, -Doctor... Now you listen closely... I invited you as a friend... I did not have the intention to insult your persona. And if you are angry now... That is really good and you shouldn't come then,,, Because you are a grump. Maria will definitely come alone then. And you my dear, maybe too. Now wait a second handyman... Good... ...bye, Mister Milan. Where ever we go, you shame us with that Bobo and his parents. What will they think about us if we have "friends" like that. I'm not a person who judges people based on what they do. So on what should I value them? Your stupid relationship is compromising me on every step. Dad is right. You a chance with a fine young man from a nice family. You people are impossible. Soon as you reconciled you turned on me. Where are not against you, it's for you good. And when will you stop with projecting your values on me? We are projecting on you? You are rude! Now listen you child, you will go with us to Budapest. I won't let this go on! You shut up! I won't go with you to Budapest. While you enjoy the magical violins of Budapest I will be with an ordinary Bobo! When can cross this two fools off... Only Maria is coming. All Bobo's friends are coming, okay... Live music, okay... My uncle, okay... 283 invites... Daro please round it to 300. Everyone should know when Zika is sending his son off. That is only half a minute of work... -So what? And how will you pay all of this. When you spent all our saving the other day. Well... That is true... Category "A" issue... Fucking... Daro! I'll sell my Mercedes! The Mercedes! -That is where the money is. Well excuse me you... That is not an option! How do you expect me to visit my family out in the country? Without the Mercedes, you think? I couldn't face that shame because of that! Daro... You act like you where born in the Mercedes so you can't live without him. That car isn't for us... It is for those... Upper-class... For snobs! I thought we where snobs too... Why wouldn't we be? For mine own money I can be whatever I want. No, Daro... You don't understand anything. Come to your senses! I won't give the Mercedes! I won't! I worked for 10 long years... While you where in Frankfurt. And now I should sell it? I won't! But Daro... I don't want to be worse then the others. Skinny Mile was telling me... ...that he spent 20 millions ....when he was sending his sone of to army. And he has 3 more sons! What are you saying? -20 millions. Skinny Mile isn't skinny since he got the new job. And I'm sending off my only son... And I won't regret a penny for it. Period. I'll spend 30 millions. Let them speak how brother Zika. spent 10 millions more... ...then Skinny Mile, You understand? We are going tonight to Milutovac. Yeah, the farewell party will be there. And you, first thing in the morning, buy a bus ticket and please try not to be late. My parents want it and there isn't a way around. They do it more for them then for me so everyone sees it.

What can you do? Higher powers... Higher powers... It's always the same story! How long will we wait? -I don't know, two tankers crashed, oil got spilled. And in this economic situation? May God help us... Is there any other road to Milutovac? -No, this is the only way. Thanks. Maybe something happened? It happened but in Budapest. Friends, bottoms up! Yeah, I like that idea. No, put the glasses down First a toast! What do you say, a toas!? Soldiers! Recruits! Corporals and the others! Here I would like to toast to our son and grandson Slobodan. Who is going in to the army... Actually, my children, I am substituting... Zika's father, Slobodan's grandfather, that is... ...my brother, from my uncle... ...Milutina, who... May God rest his soul Died in a transportation accident. A horse killed him. Right in his forehead! Poor guy, he just got the horse winter horseshoes. Grandpa Vukasin, the toast!
