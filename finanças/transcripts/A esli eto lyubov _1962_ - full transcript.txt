But What If This Is Love? This morning, my dad went to Moscow. Mom had gone off somewhere. And I'm sitting, thinking, and I don't know about you, but I'm losing my mind. I was eager to go to school because you're there. My love. I don't understand any of it. Why must I read it aloud? What's the letter, Maria Pavlovna? Who is it to? Lyudmila Nikolaevna, dear. You are the class teacher in 10A and not me. Anastasia Grigorevna, Yesterday, in my lesson, Kabalkina picked this letter up from the floor. Obviously, I took it from her. When I read it through, I literally saw red. Wait and see what comes next. Now that I know what it means to really love, I understand a lot. Terrible. You see. Not the letter. Terrible that we are reading it here. There we are. That's very noble of you. Do you know what could be behind this can kind of letter? Maria Pavlovna, there's no need to suggest the worst. Yes? Yes, yes. Speaking. Ah, hello, Vadim Petrovich. I'm listening. Yes, yes. Vadim Petrovich, the factory has it's own targets and we have our own academic programme. I'm listening. Yes. Yes, yes. Guten tag. Sit down, please. Bragina, come to the board. - Break a leg. - Thanks. Well, I'm listening. What does this phrase mean? Well? How do you need to say it? Kabalkina, How do you need to say it correctly? Translate it. I want to see a film. Featuring Oleg Strizhenov. Stupid. Which verb did you have to learn? Write it out, please. Sit down, Bragina. Did everyone manage to copy it out? The lesson is over. Goodbye! Kabalkina! Hold on a minute. Tell me, Kabalkina, whose letter is this? Which letter? Here. It's not mine. I was sitting and I saw it on the floor, I didn't even have time to read it. Then have a read. Well? Who could have written it, in your opinion? I don't know, Maria Pavlovna. Who in this class could have that kind of relationship? Well, I knew there are some friends, but nothing like this. Maybe you recognise the handwriting. I don't know, Maria Pavlovna. Do you see, girl? You're a Komsomolka, and I hope you understand how serious this matter is. It needs to be dealt with. Obviously, there is no need for the class to find out. But you can speak to one of the girls. If they tell me whose it is, should I pass on the letter? Obviously. But first you will tell me. Where are you? Come quick. Lilacs have blossomed in my garden, You came over wearing a lilac scarf, - You came over and I came over, - Guys, let's stop for a while. No, stop it. Let's sit down, guys. Well, would you look at that? I already have guests. - You've moved! - Congratulations. Thank you, darlings. I'm inviting you to my housewarming as soon as things are sorted out. Thank you! Goodbye! My mom bought me this one as a gift. But it's almost white! - Who will sew? - Mom. - Let's go, girls. - It's pretty but gets dirty easily. Igor! Have you brought what you promised? A-ha. Just look, don't lose it. What is it? Arch of Triumph by Remarque. Give it back right now. It'll take you a year. I'll be quick and bring it tomorrow. I won't give it, I won't give it! Igor, tell her! Igor! Have it back. Calm down. Here. What's this? Look at what she's given me - Chemistry and its Role in Life. I'll get you back, Ksenka. It's super interesting! It's about the transformation of non-organic substance into protein! Lunatics! It's a library book. Ksushka, give the book back! Give it back. Give it back. There. Stop whining. - It must be about love again. - Of course it is. Repeating the same thing for 700 years. He loves her, she doesn't love him. She loves him, he doesn't love her. Why 700? Maybe 1000. What's the difference? Let's go to the cinema, guys. The cinema? I need to brush up on physics. What's showing? He loves her, she doesn't love him. Then I'm interested. Let's go. Ksenia? Let's go to the cinema. The cinema? Go on then. Let's go. Okay. 8:20 at the cinema. Hi, girls. Hi. Natasha, it's us. Petya, take this, won't you? Borka, come here. Smirnova! Smirnova, put me down. Ka...balkina. Girls, let's go. Here's the letter. Blacksmiths are doing well, huh? They're no better than us. 104.3 percent. Which us? Mechanics. Ah, that us. I see now. At least 4 percent of this is ours. At least 3. Those 0.3 percent must be yours. Ah, youngsters. Ksenia! Zavyalova! Hold on a minute. Bragina! Petka! Hey. Catch. Let's go. What's this? Nothing. None of your business. Petka, how dare you! What are you doing? ...I'm losing my mind. Give it back right now. An essay or something? It's not an essay, it's a letter! Brothers, Kabalkina received a love letter. You wake up in the morning, wanting to sing and scream out loud... Now that I know what it means to love... Brothers, it's from Oleg Strezhenov! Give it back, please. Listen - now that I know what it means to really love, I understand a lot. He finally understood Kabalkina... It's not my letter. Give it back now. I can't be without you. I can't be without you, my love, my dear Kabalkina. Who stole my letter? Give it back right now. Ksusha, are you the sweetheart? Give it here! That changes things... Give the letter back! - Tell me who it's from. - Nothing to do with you. Tell me who and I'll give it you. Give the letter. Give it back right now. Stop that right away. You fool. Go to your departments. Ivan Timofeevich, look at what they've done here. What a disgrace. Where are you? In a school yard or a forest? What happened? Ivan Timofeevich? Sergey Sergeevich, school-kids were fighting. Because of her. If you don't respect yourself, at least respect the workplace. We need to inform the school. Here's the letter they were reading. Who is in charge of them? Toropov. Well, let him sort this out. Why were you fighting? What's your last name? Say something. Another one. What's your last name? Ramzin. Pavel Afanasievich's son? It doesn't matter. What a goose. And why are you like this? Are you seeing this? It's 8 o'clock, by the way. Sergey Sergeevich. Yes. Can I speak with you for a minute? It didn't turn out great, of course. But I'd like to apologise on their behalf. For my friends, and... Fine then. Get to work for now. Whose letter is it? Where have you taken it from? As if it's my fault. Maria Pavlovna gave it me. She told me to find out whose it is. Borka. Whose letter is it? Mine. Ksush, why have you opened the window as if it's summer? What about breakfast? I had it already. What about Tanya? She can get there herself. What are you like? Hurry up. Mother, don't let her relax. She'll be late for school. Okay. I'm off. What now, Borya? Hell knows. Oh God, what a fool I am. How could I have lost it? The middle page fell out. - Know who found it? - Who? Maria. I don't know. Can you imagine what happens now? What? In the end, what's all the fuss about. All the fuss. - What's up? - Lariska's coming. What of it? I don't want her to see us. What will we do - hide? This way. There's 3 minutes left. Let's go. You go first. Don't be silly. Let's go. What's the matter? You know what, Borya? You go, I'll stay. Why? What are you afraid of? Nothing. It doesn't feel right. You go. Then I'm not going either. Together. - Hello. - Hello. Where? I don't know. To the forest? The forest?! Okay. Hello, everyone. Sit down. Who's in charge today? It's me. Who is absent? Ramzin. Zavyalova. Something like this. The table top has two propeller wheels, one on top of the other. The top one sucks air in, and the lower one... Ksen... What's up now? Ksen. It's right what they say. Happiness lasts only for a minute. Trouble is always around. Here we go. Who told you that? My mom always says. Your mom? Well, I don't know. I think it's the other way round. It's normal for a person to be happy. And what if they're not? If they're unhappy, it's only temporary. It's like a cold. You're ill then you're better. They'll kick us out of school, then you'll see. A cold. Who cares? They can do what they like. Let's go to ballet school. - You were planning to, weren't you? - Borka! I'll get you! - I'll catch you! - No, you won't! You'll see! Wait, Borka! Coward! Coward! What's wrong? Borka! Wait a second! Serves you right. Wow! Ksenia! Look how many mushrooms there are! Borka, don't you dare! They're mine! Don't touch them! Go away! I found them. They're my mushrooms! My mushrooms! Borka, let me go! So many. Give me the bag. Here. Fantastic. What a beauty. Are you sure they're not poisonous? They're honey mushrooms. My grandma fries them really well. Ksyu. What are you doing? What's the point? We can't take them home anyway. Ksyush. What are we going to say tomorrow? We'll think of something. They're disgusting. Grandma, Ksenia wasn't at school. What do you mean? How do you know? Maria Pavlovna told me to tell mum to come to school. What are you going on about? She is Ksenia's teacher. Wait, what did the teacher say? She came and asked, "Who is Tatyana Zavyalova?". I said, "That's me." Stop wittering on. Tell me exactly what the teacher said. She said that Ksenia wasn't at school. And that mum needs to come in. Deary me. What is all this? Is she in the yard? No! I hope nothing terrible has happened. Sergey Petrovich. Have you seen Ksenia, my granddaughter? No, I haven't. She took her bag this morning and left. And Tanyushka came back and said that she hadn't been in school. Where can she be? I don't know what to think. The teacher asked her mother to go in. Proskovya Ivanovna. What's happened? Our Ksenia has disappeared. How "disappeared"? She went to school this morning. Took her bag. As usual. But Tanyushka says that she wasn't at school. I don't know what to think. Don't worry, Proskovya Ivanovna. Surely she can't just disappear. Maybe go to the hospital? Why the hospital? It's very simple. Our cleaner's niece was visiting. So she arrived, stayed one night. Went out for a walk and fell under a truck. God save her. Why are you scaring her? Proskovya Ivanovna, wait and I'll join you. Grandma, wait! Don't go! I know where Ksenia went. Where? She went to the forest. What do you mean, forest? Are you making it up? I'm not making it up. Katya Vorobyova from our class saw it. She was late and saw Ksenia going to the forest. What for? Which forest? To hell with you. Don't worry, grandma. She wasn't on her own. She was with a boy. A boy? Which boy? What are you blabbering about? Don't say if you don't know. I'm not blabbering. Katya Vorobyova said it. Go home now. Deary me. What can we do now? What can you do? Run to the forest, grandma. Where are you going? So pretty. Come here. Let me. Did you know that my grandma was married in this church? Really? And mother was christened. Locals, aren't we, from Kuzmikhino? Villagers. Mom wanted to christen me, but dad wouldn't allow it. Do you know how interesting it is when grandma talks about her wedding? There was a choir, a priest and everyone cried. She only saw her groom once, at the matchmaking. Let's go. Get on your knees... for the marriage of god's child Ksenia... and god's child Boris... Amen! Say 'amen'. Say it. I can't begin to understand how my grandma was anything like me. And I'll be a grandma one day. And I'll have grandchildren. You'll have a big beard and grandchildren, too. What do you mean, 'too'? If you have grandchildren, I'll have them too. How? Your grandchildren will be mine. What's up, Ksen? The rain has stopped. Explain it to me, please. Why do we write such letters, and when we meet we talk about everything apart from this? Can we talk about it, though? It'll only set you off. Try it. I can't, not just like that. See. Ksenia, you know. What do I know? That I love you. Who says that? Say it properly. I love you. Ksen. Don't do that again, got it? Why not? Just because. Ksenia. I love you very much, Ksenechka. It's just... I didn't think it was possible. Bor, what time is it? Three. Oh my. Go, climb. Where's the bag? Come here. Give me your hand. What will we say tomorrow? We didn't think of anything. There's no point. You said yourself - it's not good to lie. Tell it how it is and that's it. I can tell them myself. What will you say? I'll tell them that I love you. Just like that? Just like that. Give me your hand. What happened? The Zavyalova girl has disappeared. Not disappeared - she went to the forest with her boyfriend. The mother can't believe it. It can't be. I can't believe it for the life in me. Everyone knows her. She would never deceive or tell a lie. Teachers praise her all the time. It's true, she is a model child. There you go. She was appointed the lead pioneer. Don't worry. We don't know anything yet. She wasn't at school. How do you know that she wasn't at school? You heard it yourself, her youngest daughter said. - Her Tanyushka said so. - You'd sooner believe a 7 year old. As if she understands. Why worry now? You go home. Mother, take her home. Okay, ladies, let me through. Listen to me, Tatyana Maximovna. She's a good girl, your daughter. You still need to keep an eye on her. The other day, my Fedor Alexeivich, told me. There was an ugly fight because of her at the factory. It can't be. Nothing like that has ever happened with her. She wrote some kind of letter, then two of them had a fight. I can't tell you which of those she's dating. That I don't know. Don't say if you don't know. And don't spread gossip. Tatyana Maximovna, I would go to the school now, if I were you. There really was a mess today, my Nadya told me. And where's your Nadya? She's at home. Nadya! Let's go. Nadya! Nadya! What, mom? Is what you told me true? What did I tell you? About what happened in school. Why did you need to know? Don't be silly, Nadya. Do you see how Ksenia's mom is worried? I don't know anything. There, that's them walking. Ask them. There! There she is. Ksenechka! Come here, girl. Where have you been? Were you at school? Some people don't believe it. Tatyana, better at home. Not in the yard. Why don't you say something? What's the matter? Where were you? Her coat is a mess. Go home, Ksenechka. - Stop. Where were you? - Tatyana Maximovna! Let her go! What are you doing, Tatyana? Tanya! You should be ashamed. At least, not in front of everyone. What happened, Borya? Nothing, mom. Come on, tell me. Nothing. Let's go. You call that mothering. How will the girl go out in public? You could say it's barbaric. I didn't know what to do. What's barbaric about it? That's what mothers are for. Who wants their daughter to grow up a hussy? You shouldn't say these things in front of your child. Bugger off from here with your pan. Easier to fly to the moon 100 times, than explain it to her. You're both mothers, you should understand that the question is very serious. The school doesn't have the right to overlook such facts. To put it simply, we are obliged to expel them. Why Ksenia, headmistress? Is she the one who started the fight? She didn't write the letter. So, Boris is to blame for everything? - Who else? - Wait a second. Nobody is expelling them just yet. Of course, I wouldn't want to take such radical measures. Let's think all together about how we can sort it. We'll ask the Komsomol for help. We've invited comrade Toropov. The head of the factory practice. Let's listen to what he says. Please begin, comrade Toropov. What is there to say? There was indeed a fight. It's a fact. We've established that. It's a question of the circumstances. It couldn't have happened without reason. Why without reason? There was a reason and, in my opinion, it was a serious enough reason. That letter there. I don't know. Forgive me, but I can't imagine that Boris would allow himself to do anything. A boy can do much worse without an upbringing. Why are you saying that? Of course. Allow me, Anastasia Grigorevna. Okay. Since you mention upbringing, is it true that you hit Ksenia yesterday in the yard? No one hit her. She deserved to be struck across the cheek. What do you think? Instead of her classes, she'll be off in the forest, embarrassing her mother. And what am I to do? So, according to you, it's okay to hit a girl. Is this upbringing? Is this the method? I haven't studied your methods. It's your job to use your methods. It's what you're paid for. Tatyana Maximovna, this is not a conversation. Teachers are paid to do their job. That doesn't free you from bringing up your children. But not in that way, of course. It's all well and good talking about which way. After working in the canteen all day, to come home again, to wash, to cook, to do this and that, Calm down. Calm down, Tatyana Maximovna. I understand that it's not easy for you. Believe me, it's not easy for us either. Please continue, comrade Toropov. How to continue? It's clear. There's just one thing I can't grasp. Why was this letter given to others to read? Allow me, Anastasia Grigorevna. Sorry - who would you say are "other people"? Teachers? Maybe the headmistress? Parents? Everyone, if you want to know. Everyone. Definitely classmates. How could you allow the letter to get into their hands? Not just could, but must. What do you mean, "must"? Must turn Rita Kabalkina into an inspector. Oh no. I apologise. Please don't twist the facts. Nobody turned Kabalkina into an inspector. That's one thing. Secondly, even though you're a young teacher, you ought to know that school is a collective, which brings a mutual responsibility. Do you know what is meant by young people's moral grounding? I'm aware. Then how can we be tolerant of such immoral behaviour? Just wait, Maria Pavlovna. Why immediately assume the worst? We don't know how far their relationship has progressed. How much further can it go? Excuse me, Anastasia Grigorevna, are you aware what happened in Beryozovskaya School? A girl from the 9th grade give birth. There you are. Did you hear? What do we do now? Let's suspect every girl, in every 9th grade class, and 10th too, while we're at it. You, comrade, are not a teacher. And to you the name of the school and it's reputation just.. ...don't mean a thing. I'm not a teacher. That's true. But seriously, comrades. If we suspect all children of every deadly sin, or publicly shame them like we just heard about, then I don't know. This can push them to hell knows what. Definitely. Oh, Lyudmila Nikolaevna, quit agreeing with everything. What if it's something genuine they're feeling? Real. And big. What then? Well, if a teacher suggests that then I don't know. They're still here! Guys, come here. Come on. What is it? - Have they called you in? - Not yet. We decided to ask for your advice. So don't leave. You hear, Boris? We'll wait for you. They called him in too. We'll all pay for it. Zavyalova. - Ksen, we're waiting for you. - Break a leg. You, Ramzin, stay put. Why? We're together. You'll be called for. Is this the director? It is, but you can't go in right now. Busy. You must be in trouble. So have ours. Mom and dad are at the factory all day, and I am the only one to answer for it. Can you believe what he did? In the class, where they study... those skeletons, He put a cigarette in one of the mouths. As if the skeleton was smoking. I would... I would have died of horror twenty times. He's not bothered, the rascal. Why did you call for just her? I wrote the letter, not her. I should answer for it. It's good that you realise this. Since you've intruded like this, maybe you'll explain how it all happened. Why have you gone quiet? Tell us. Well? Boris? I said it's my fault. What else do you want? Ksenia, you can go. Go home, do you hear? There's no point in acting like this, dear friend. "It's all my fault." It is really all your fault. Did you think about the position you put Ksenia in? And the school. And all of us. Now here are we. We have to make a decision about your staying in school. Go ahead then. Decide. Boris! Just keep Ksenia out of it. If you want to expel anyone, then let it be me. How dare you talk like that! Look at this knight in shining armour. Okay then. You go. I wonder how we missed them. We didn't miss them. They didn't want to be seen. Rude of them. Don't rush into judging them. "Rude." We don't know what happened there. Maybe they were expelled. Guys, what if we don't go to German class anymore? - What are you talking about? - You're being ridiculous. I don't know what to do with the teacher. Explain this for me, please. - We study literature, right? - And? Every work of literature, every book writes about love. - That's true. - Let's assume. Not assuming. It's a fact. Even in our German lessons, we learn "Arme Liebe deines hertzens". - Not 'arme', but 'warme'. - Okay, 'warme'. But 'Liebe' is 'love'? Why is it considered shameful? Or, I don't know, something horrible. What did you expect? It's pedagogy. Exactly. Pedagogy. There's one thing I don't understand here. Why the hell did they need to write those letters? They sit together in class and still write each other letters Idiots. If you want to say something, say it. Isn't it possible that you can see someone everyday, and even sit next to them, and they still seem unreachable. That's too complicated. Not complicated. Absolutely true. I think that, if you fall in love with someone, you're unable to neither talk to them or even look at them. That's why you never look at me! Nadyush, look at me. What are we going to do now? Petr, wait. What? We need to do something. Guys. Let's go and see them. Talk with them. How, when they're avoiding us? What are they afraid of? Are we their enemy or something? We don't get it, do we? For what it's worth, I'd have done the same. Oh yeah.Why? Because. They've had enough of a telling off already, without us. It's not nice when someone is getting in your head. Nonsense. In case you're wondering, no one was getting in their heads. As if. We're in there already. Who? Everyone, including you. Tanya, guys, stop arguing. Seryozh! What's up? Annoying when somebody talks nonsense. Why are you angry at him? I'm not angry. You can't say anything to him. I can just be quiet. Natasha, wait. Let's go to Boris, then? Why? You still expect me to go? As if I'm Jesus Christ or something. To hell with you. Petya! Igor! Petya! Hooray! Hooray! Happy holiday! Thank you, sweetheart. Grow up to be big, tall, and beautiful! Be happy. I thought we would definitely meet. And we've met! Happy holiday, sir! Wait, little girl. Happy holiday, sir! And a happy holiday to you. Happy holidays. And you too! Hi. Happy holidays. I said it to you already. Say 'same to you'. Go away. Say it to me. Ksenia! Ksenia! Ksen! Hello. We came for Ksenia. She's not going anywhere. Not to the demonstration? Anywhere, I said. - Yes? - Yes. Happy holidays. Thank you. You too. Hello. Hello, boys. - Is Borya at home? - No. Has something happened? No. I just wanted to come over to mine tonight. Okay. I'll tell him. Tell him he has to. Okay, boys. Thank you. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Oh, hey. Why are you sunbathing here alone? Come with us. No. Zhen, let's go. Well, see you. Is it true they kicked you out of school? Who told you that? Guys. He was kicked out of school because of a girl. Tell us how it happened. It's nothing. Stop talking rubbish. - Rubbish! - Why are you standing here like an orphan? Our guys are down there. Is that your girl, there? On the side. The short one. You're wrong there. What do we think, boys? Not bad? As if she's a beauty. Is yours better then? 1000 times. You must be kidding. Show us. Where is she? - She's not here. - Where is she, then? At home. Her mother mustn't have not let her out. Ah, did you hear? Something really must have happened. There must be a reason. Go to hell. She's not like that. Like this, like that. You can't fool us. Hold him, guys. Let's have a beer. Which one is hers? That one. Wait a second. We can't all go. Like this: You will go, Lyoshka, Boris and I. The rest stay here. Let's go. Why here? And me? You're drunk, so stay here. You'll spoil it for us. Got it. Let's go. Stop, guys. What is it? We can't. It's not going to work. She won't let us see her. Who won't? Her mother won't let us. Listen, Boris. Don't be soft. What are you afraid of? Afraid of her mother? We'll get her for you. You'll at least be able to hang out. There's nothing wrong with that. - Let's go. - Of course, let's go. Such a sissy. It's not possible. Not like that. We'll make it worse for her. Don't, guys. Bor, what is it? I love her, guys. We need to get her out somehow. It's not right. Bor. Listen, Boris. What if we throw a pebble? Will she understand? A pebble? - We can try. - Let's do it. Boris. Take this. Too small. What about this? This won't work. Borya, Borya! Look here. Too light. It won't get there. Why wouldn't it? Which window, did you say? The second between balconies? Look. Just look at him. What are you doing, you shameless devil? People are celebrating and what are you doing? Damned fascist. You had nothing to eat yesterday. Today, you're on a hunger strike. All of this is to annoy your mother. Tanya! Tanya! Tanya! Tanya! What do they want? What is it? The teacher is on her way. The teacher. You could have at least combed your hair, sitting here like God knows who. Hello. Hello. Hello, Ksenia. I came to see you. Hello. - Would you mind? - Why would I? Go out into the yard right now. How do you like this, teacher? People are celebrating and she is sat here in her grandma's jumper. She hasn't eaten for 2 days. Excuse me, Tatyana Maximovna. I'd like to speak with Ksenia. Okay then. If you have secrets from mother, go on then. Your mother is angry. You really haven't eaten anything? What if I don't want to? And haven't been outside? It seems a bit over the top to me. - Well, get dressed and let's go. - Where? Let's go for a walk and chat. No, Lyudmila Nikolaevna. I'm not going. What's the matter? Ksenia? Why not? Why are you quiet? Do you think it feels good? What does? When everyone is staring and thinking God knows what. I'm ashamed. I'm sorry but it's nonsense. For a start, not everyone thinks things. I don't, for example. And your friends don't, I'm sure. And you think it's better to sit at home like this. Let's go. Listen, Ksenechka. Can I be completely open with you? Of course. I want to understand just one thing. Do you really love each other? Well... we became friends. And then suddenly he... wrote me a letter. We started to write each other letters. We've never really spoken about it. Just once, I think. Ksenechka, I absolutely believe you. I would like it if- Do you understand, Ksenechka? I want you to believe one thing. Only time can show how serious it is between you two. Understand? I hope you're not planning on getting married tomorrow. Of course not, Lyudmila Nikolaevna. Very well. And another thing, my dear. After the celebration, let's go to Anastasia Gregorevna, and tell it all to her. He's a wise old lady. She'll understand. Sound good? Do you know what I would do now if I were you? What? For starters, I wouldn't carry on hiding myself away. I'd stop feeling down. Are you listening? Lift your head up. Like that. There's no reason to hide if you're not to blame. Don't you agree? Nadya is here. Hello, Lyudmila Nikolaevna. Hello. Let's go. Where to? It's Natasha Smirnova's birthday. Oh, you have to go. Ksenia, get up. Stop sulking, Ksenia. Go, get changed, brush your hair quickly. We'll leave together. Nadya, take her mind off things. Go to a club or somewhere in the evening. Don't leave her on her own. I understand. Well, goodbye then. Say happy birthday to Natasha for me. Thank you. Ksenia. Nose. That's better. So, do we have a deal? Off you go. What deal is that? Nothing much. Nadya! What, mum? We're going to Natasha! Come up here for a minute. Why? I can't shout across the whole yard. Wait a second. Where's the groom? Boris and Ksenia, sitting in a tree! K-I-S-S-I-N-G First comes love, second comes marriage, Third comes the baby in the baby's carriage! Oh, you cheeky monkey. Just look at him. You just wait. Next time I'll get you by your ears. What are you doing? Let's go. This way. Hello, Ksenechka. Hello. Well done, lad. The right thing to do. The bus didn't even turn up! Ksenia! Ksenia. What is it? Why did you do that? Why? Everyone watches and you hold me by the arm. Now they'll definitely think something. I spit at them. I don't care what they think. They don't know anything. You shouldn't either. Ksen. Why are you being like this? It's easy for everyone to say. Don't pay any attention, don't sulk. Have you thought about me? You're all I think about. Well, sit. Ksyush. There's no one there. Let's go outside. What are you shaking for? Don't you understand? You saw them yourself. Come to the club tonight. I can't. Please understand. We can't meet anymore. Stop. What? Maybe I'll just leave. Up and leave. To hell with it. I don't know. Go for it. It's better if you leave. Ksyusha! Well, what's with you? What is it now? Ksyush. Tanya, bring some water quick. Calm down. Enough. Here. Have some water. My dear daughter. Don't cry. Please don't cry. It's all my fault. It didn't come from a bad place. I don't need anything for myself. Just for you and Tanya to do well. That's all I care about. As for hitting you, that can hurt a mother a thousand times more. Forgive me. Forgive your mother. Forgive me. Hit my stupid self. Like that, go on. You can't even imagine what they're saying about me. Who's saying what, sweetheart? Commoners. Don't listen to them. They'll stop going on about it soon. That's what they're like. So is that teacher. Why did she come here? What did she have to say? You should just listen to mum. Mum doesn't give bad advice. Wipe your tears, don't let them hurt your eyes. My little star. What lovely hands and feet. Enough, mum. Okay. I won't, I won't. Tell me what you'd like. A hot pie that grandma has just baked? You're all pale. You don't sleep, you don't look at food. I don't want to eat. Would you like to try on the new dress? I only have to finish the hem. Go sweetheart, go to your room. Mother, give me the dress. Look how pretty. Only the skirt to finish and it's done. Let's see. Why do I need this dress? What will you wear to the club? I'm not going to any club. My darling. What did we make it for then? Were those nights sitting and sewing for nothing? Get undressed. Mother, nobody's in. Hello, Praskovya Ivanovna. Is Ksenia home? She's not back yet. There's no one here. - Where is she, Praskovya Iv- - I don't know, darling. I don't know anything. Great. Let's see, then. Just look at how beautiful you are. Look! Just look in the mirror and see. Look at how beautiful you are. Wait a second. We need to fix the plaid. Sweetie! That's the prettiest part. There's no need for them. Mother, look how well it suits her. Very good! Her breasts, what about them? It really shows them off. It's hard not to fall in love with her. Anyone will. Not just that wet blouse. There you go again! Mother, take the iron and see to the dress. Silly one. Who else will save you apart from your mother? Like the teacher was saying yesterday. A girl in ninth grade becoming a mother. Is that right? Why are you telling me this? We didn't even think about anything like that. Maybe you should think. Thank God you're no longer a child. They didn't think. Maybe you didn't. He definitely has. He's practically a man. What are you saying? You don't know him at all. I know him well enough. They're all the same with the same thing in mind. He doesn't have anything in mind. Why else would he be after you? Silly one. He loves me. Don't you get it? Oh, mother. What do you think love is? Go on, have a think. It's only a pretty word. But the essence is the same. You're a fool. Dad! Welcome back. What is it, dad? Is it for me? Wait. That's for later. Sit. Wait, Pasha. Borya, you're hungry. You haven't eaten all day. Go, wash your hands. Okay, then. While mother isn't here. Tell me what's going on. There's nothing to tell. You've already been told. Do you have to interfere? Right. Who's there? Who was that? No one. Borya, come and eat. Borya. - Where is he? - He left. What do you mean? He slammed the door and left. Ignorant. Borya! Boris! What happened? What did you say to him? What did I say? I didn't say anything. Should I have bowed to him? Why do you need to be like that? I waited for you. Thought you'd come, talk with the boy. What have you done? I don't know. Hell knows how to talk to him. What do people say in this kind of situation? It seems like he loves her. Understand? It's torturing him. I see how hard it is for him. Let's get him married so that he doesn't suffer! A father bends his back to feed him, dress him. A mother washes his clothes. And he grows up to be a layabout. A married one. Is that right? Don't shout. Make me some tea, please, Sonya. Sonya, listen. Maybe this is all nonsense. Maybe we have exaggerated it all. What really did happen? They write letters. Maybe they kiss. So what? He's a good lad, isn't he? None of this is their fault. I'm sure of it. But this is how it has turned out. How stupid. What can you do? Maybe I'll go and look for him. Sonya? Ksenia. Hello. Can I talk to you for a minute? You know, I wanted to tell you... But don't be angry. I honestly didn't know that it was your letter. I really didn't think of it. Sorry, Ksenechka. I feel so bad about this. Rit? Rit. - Can you do me a favour? - What is it? Have you seen Boris? I haven't, no. Hasn't he left? What do you mean, left? What makes you say that? I don't know. The guys from the factory mentioned it. They're dancing there. Let's ask. No, no. I'm not going in there. Rita, please. Go and find out. I'll wait here by the stairs for you. But don't tell anyone I'm here. Hello, Ksenia. Why aren't you greeting me? Why aren't you answering, Zavyalova? Well? I don't want to answer you. I don't want to greet you. Because you hate me. You're being silly. Here is not the place for this conversation. We'll talk later. I won't talk to you later. Ksenia! I thought you already left, Borya. Ksenechka. I thought you already left. How could I have left without seeing you? What do we do? What do we do now? I don't know. Are you leaving? You told me to. I can't. I don't want you to go. Do you hear? I can't be alone here. There, there. Do you love me? Madly. Completely? For real? I'm madly in love. Ksenechka. What will happen to us, Borya? I don't know. You're leaving, aren't you? It means my mother was right. It means you don't need me at all. What are you saying? You've lost your mind. Guten tag. Sit down, please. The head of the class? Yes. Who is absent? Ramzin and Zavyalova. And Bragina. And Bragina, too. Sit down. Why are you late, Bragina? Because... Because what? Wait a second. Go to the board and write: I was late for the lesson. Perfectly. Ksenia Ksenia poisoned herself. There you are. A bill to pay. 9 roubles, 80 kopecks. There. 40 roubles. Sugar. A kilogram of vermicelli. Loose or in a packet? In a packet. Vermicelli. Spaghetti, please. Hello, Borya. Hello, Ksen. Have I changed? Not really. What are you looking at, then? Just haven't seen you in a while. What do you have there? Nothing much. Vermicelli. How are you feeling? I'm well. Completely well? Completely. Don't worry. I came to the hospital. But they didn't let me in. The nurse said that you didn't want to see me. Was that true? I didn't want to see anyone back then. What about now? Why are you quiet? I came here, didn't I? Tell me. Why did you do it? Ksyush. God, it was stupid of me. Why do you have to bring it up? Do you think I'm to blame for everything? What do you mean, 'everything'? You remember. There's no need to talk about this. The snow has melted again. You left, did you? To Kursk Anomaly. With my father. He wanted me to stay, actually. At Kursk Anomaly? It's really interesting there. Imagine - you sit down, and in 10-15 minutes you descend down 2 million years. Can you imagine? How? There are layers. Layers of quartz that were formed 2 million years ago. It's fascinating. Look. Here's a layer. Is it a new hobby? Why didn't you stay? I don't think it's hard to guess. You shouldn't have. It really is very interesting. I can learn. Would you like to go? No, Bor. I'm going to my aunt in Novosibirsk. Why Novosibirsk? One can learn there too. Then, there's a chemistry institute. I don't understand. Why Novosibirsk? Why did you decide this on your own? It'll be better this way. Sit. Will your mother let you? I won't stay at home anyway. Have you been to school? Why would I want to go there? You know, everyone was really nice. Yeah? Very attentive. Even Petka. And Kabalkina sat under my window all the time. What is it? That Rita is a funny one. She brought my pioneers over from 6B. They came with their horns and made a racket. The whole hospital was a scene. Don't, Borya. To hell with it. This all turned out really stupidly. I should go. Farewell. Listen, Ksyush. What if I go with you? Tell me. You don't love me anymore? I don't want any kind of love, Bor. I want to study and work. Study at university. I'll come anyway. As you wish. Well, bye. THE END subs by matty5190 @ KG
