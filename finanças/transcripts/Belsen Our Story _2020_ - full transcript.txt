This programme contains scenes which some viewers may find disturbing DOG BARKS There was a point where I couldn't differentiate between what had actually happened to me and what I had imagined, what I'd fantasised, what I thought had happened. I was four years old. I thought, after a while, the only way to settle this is to go back to Belsen. It's a kind of heathland. The feeling, the atmosphere of the place was still there, for some reason. All my doubts about stuff that had happened - did this really happen, did that really happen? - absolutely vanished completely. Everything was real. A remarkable group of people who now call Britain their home survived one of World War II's most horrific concentration camps - Bergen-Belsen. It was one of the first camps liberated by the British. And when journalist Richard Dimbleby entered Belsen in April 1945, nothing could have prepared him for what he saw. ARCHIVE: Beyond the barrier was a whirling cloud of dust. The dust of thousands of slowly moving people. I passed through the barrier and found myself in the world of a nightmare. Within days, this broadcast became a watershed moment in Britain's understanding of the Holocaust, with film and photographs revealing a Nazi atrocity for all to see. Conditions in the camp were so horrendous, troops had to burn it to the ground. Physical proof of the Nazis' crimes was destroyed... ..and much of the evidence of what happened in Belsen has remained locked in the memories of those who were there. There were dead bodies everywhere. Piles of naked, twisted, decaying corpses. It was a horrific sight. Death was not an event - or ceased to be an event - in Belsen. Because death was everywhere. Belsen reveals a lesser-known side of the Holocaust... ..how the Final Solution unravelled in the closing months of the war, resulting in disorder and chaos. A concentration camp not designed to kill, which ended up inflicting suffering on an unimaginable scale. In Auschwitz, we were killed in the most sophisticated way. In Belsen, they didn't need any machinery. You just perished there. For a long time, Belsen was a distant memory. Although I was a child, it is a very important part of my life. Going back, there are questions of what my life would have been, having a father. He died there, and of course, there is no individual marker where he is. There are graves which state that it's 8,000 or 5,000 or 200, and I don't know where he is. So that is, in a way, when I go to Belsen - that is kind of not just visiting a concentration camp, but I'm visiting, emotionally, my father's grave. It's not easy to come back. It's still, emotionally, very, very real. I feel it's important. And for me, it's most important for one reason, and that's that I'm visiting a graveyard, a cemetery, and I feel that the victims should never be forgotten. As I'm proceeding further into what was the camp... ..I'm remembering more and more - it brings it back more vividly. And...it's hard to bear - even after all these years. All the bodies and the terrible stench. You know, I can actually see it. ARCHIVE GERMAN VOICES FROM A NAZI RALLY THEY CHANT "HEIL HITLER" About ten years before Belsen became a concentration camp, Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany. The world slowly began to change for those who would eventually become imprisoned at Belsen - including Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, who grew up in Germany. Life seem very happy and normal till I had the first anti-Semitic remark in the school that I visited. Somebody, a child didn't want me to clean the blackboard. "Don't give the Jew the sponge." I said, "What's going on?" I had to ask, "What's the matter with Jews?" So once I understood what was the matter with Jews, because it was a slow shifting outside normal life. My father woke us all up in a very excited voice and said, "Children, come, come, come to the window. Come, come, come quickly. "Things are happening." On the street in front of our house was a flow of German army motorcycles in black uniforms and iron helmets in hundreds and thousands. It was like a parade of black ants. And nobody knew what it meant. It was the German invasion of Czechoslovakia. The Nazis seized control of Czechoslovakia in March 1939. At this time, Belsen was primarily an established German military complex. But this would soon change. Six months later, the Nazis invaded Poland. The Second World War was about to begin. The space between the German border and our town was immediately annexed, and it became part of the German Reich. And became Judenfrei, which is what they wanted - free of Jews. And by the 1st of November 1939, we were forced out of our homes into this very overcrowded ghetto. And there, conditions were really bad. The Nazis organised Jewish ghettos in several occupied countries... ..and began using Belsen as an internment camp to detain prisoners of war from Belgium and France. By July 1940, the Nazis occupied nine European nations - including the Netherlands, the childhood home of Belsen survivor Maurice Blik. We lived in Amsterdam in a flat above... I think it was a grocer's shop. On this little suburban part of Amsterdam. There was an ominous feeling, these officers on the back of open cars. I remember on one occasion, going down the stairs and there was a German soldier there. You know, he said, "Where do you live?" "Upstairs." You know. And he followed me up the stairs, I remember that very clearly. You know, clomping with his boots and his rifle. Following me up the stairs. And... ..questioning. Frightening, because I thought, "What am I doing, bringing this guy into my house?" You know, "What's my mother going to say?" Years and years and years later, I still don't remember whether that was the moment when we were, you know, taken away. By January 1942, Belsen had expanded significantly to hold thousands of prisoners of war from the Soviet Union, many of whom died from starvation, exhaustion and disease. It's at this time that the Nazis began the Final Solution. A plan to murder every Jew within their reach. To enact their strategy, the most infamous sites of the 20th century were created - Nazi death camps. Ghettos all over Europe were liquidated. A genocide gathered pace. On the 9th of April 1942, the moment came that we'd all dreaded. They got notice that, within 24 hours, they have to report to a certain place. I mean, that was deportation. But only my parents - not my sister and I. That night - I shall never forget it - my mother was crying, of course, and my father, who was a very meticulous man, he had a lot of things to finish up. And then, next day, when everything was in order, as it were... ..we joined them, marching through Breslau to a certain place, which was called the Schiesswerder. That was a sort of amusement park, really. That's where all the Jews who were deported on that day had to assemble. And then we said goodbye. I mean, it is... It's indescribable. Goodbye. Finished. End of story. That's what it was like. In the middle of the night, they used to come and take the people out, to chase them out. All the people, they're taken to the woods - never see them again. When the ghetto was liquidated altogether... ..my family was intact. But, unfortunately, not for long. They knew that people had been in hiding - some people. And they were coming back out of hiding, so they're just letting them filter in. Then they started searching for them. And, on one occasion, they stormed into a room where my mother was with my sister. And they took everybody away - they arrested everybody. They marched them out... ..in groups of 50... ..at dawn to the local forest called Rakow. And the first group found their communal grave ready waiting for them. So that's how I lost my mother and sister. Jews from ghettos were sent to death camps in Eastern Europe, including Auschwitz. Among the prisoners were Peter Lantos and his family. There were trains leaving to get away from Hungary. We were on the second train because people were allocated, and my aunt with my cousin were allocated to the first train. And she, my aunt, wanted us to join them. And my mother said, "No, this is... "We were allocated, just cause problems, "they will read our names, "we are not on your list of the first train." And that train arrived in Auschwitz. And they obviously perished. They were gassed practically immediately. I arrived in Auschwitz waiting to be gassed. I get into this block where there are lots of people sitting. I come to a girl who was sort of doing me, she said, "Take your close off," and shave my hair and tattoo a number on my arm, and we start talking. I mean, she's just another Jewish prisoner. "What did you do before the war?" I said, "I used to play the cello." She said, "Fantastic." I said, "What's going on here?" By that time, I was naked with a number on my arm, no hair. So she went off, came back with a lady, very well dressed. It was her job to create an orchestra there, and they didn't have a cello yet. "You play the cello? Fanta..." I mean, ridiculous. I mean, I'm in Auschwitz. I have been asked by people, "How could you possibly play music in Auschwitz?" I say, well, imagine, you arrive in Auschwitz prepared to go into a gas chamber. Somebody sticks a cello into your hand and says, "Play something." What are you going to do? Are you going to say "I'm sorry, I only play in Carnegie Hall"? You know, it's a sort of a childish idea that it's very immoral to play music in Auschwitz. I can assure you, when it comes to life and death... I didn't know I was going to play the cello in Auschwitz, but I did. Trains travelled to Auschwitz from all over Europe... ..each one bringing thousands of Jewish people to their death. In the Netherlands, a smaller camp, called Westerbork, held Dutch Jews waiting to be assigned a fate. Maurice Blik was one of them. Every now and again, there'd be... One of the soldiers would come in with a roll call, you know, list of names. Er... And the people who were on the list were taken off. Of course, one day, my father's name was on the list, and... Yeah, you know, he said goodbye... ..to my mother and us, and told me to look after the family. Well, you know, my mother, my sister, my grandmother. And he said, "You're the man in the family, you look after them." And that was that - and I never saw him again. My father had... ..basically been torn away from us and that was incredibly painful. And... ..what I had for years and years and years was a recurring nightmare, which was me... ..being on a bus and seeing my father in the street, and the bus, you know, not being able to contact him, or he would be on a train and I'd see him go past. That went on for years every night. And I never talked about that. When the transfer of prisoners from Westerbork began, the majority were sent Auschwitz. But in September 1943, some prisoners travelled to a place most had never heard of. Bergen-Belsen. Now housing Jewish prisoners to be exchanged for German nationals. Few inmates were ever swapped. But to begin with, Belsen was one of the better places a Jewish prisoner could hope to end up. Many weren't forced into compulsory manual labour. The camp wasn't dangerously overcrowded. And, unlike extermination camps, there were no gas chambers to perform mass murder. Dutch Jews, including Maurice Blik, were among the first to arrive at Belsen. They were detained in an area that became known as Star Camp... ..where prisoners were not required to wear uniforms... ..but, as practised at some other camps, wore the distinctive Star of David sewn onto their clothing. My memory of it is wooden buildings, you know. And... ..just rows of bunk beds, three-tier bunk beds, all wooden. Used to bring in these cauldrons - for want of a better word - of soup. And you'd stand in a line to get your little bowl filled, and the trick is to be the last one because, as they're scooping out the soup, of course, the vegetables and stuff sink to the bottom. So the further back you were, the more bits of vegetable you got. Some people are so ravenous, they don't care, they just want something to eat. In September 1943, Italy - a key partner of Germany - surrendered to the Western Allies. And following the success of the D-Day landings in June 1944, the Allies were recapturing much of Europe. The Nazis were also being forced to retreat by the Soviet Union in the east. To consolidate their assets, the Nazis began evacuating camps in Eastern Europe... ..sending thousands of prisoners to Germany. 85,000 of them will eventually be sent to Belsen. We heard rumours we might be going to a place which is actually a nice place. It's called Belsen. Nobody's ever heard of it. Took about four days of a train journey, terribly cold. But, I mean, luxury compared to the people who later walked - we were in a cattle truck. It was very crowded. And it was very cold, freezing. Even with all the people. We didn't know our destination. People crowded in without much food, without much sanitation. Some people didn't survive. Suddenly, we arrived in the middle of nowhere. You can imagine, we didn't know where we were. When we arrived, the big wagons opened with a big clanking and we could hear the dogs barking. They had batons in their hands, and some of them with their rifles. It was quite high. I know we had to sort of jump down. When we arrived, I was with my mother and father. My mother still had a canvas sack. I thought it may be hidden jewellery. The guard hit my mother. She fell back. In fact, it was nothing more than a couple of onions and an apple. My mother had a nervous breakdown and, for a while, she didn't recognise me. And that was the first time when the family was divided. It's here that some of those frightened prisoners first arrived. Bergen-Belsen's train station. This is the first time Mala and Peter have returned here in over 70 years. PETER: Do you remember arriving here? Yes, I remember it quite clearly because I remember the noise of the guards, of the soldiers harassing us, and "Raus! Schnell!" There were dogs barking. It was all very scary. Where did you arrive from? From Ravensbruck. Ah, Ravensbruck. We arrived from Strasshof in Austria. I remember, by that time, it was winter, and it was bitterly cold when we arrived. It was freezing. And then we had to walk for miles. And what was even worse - we didn't know where we were arriving, even my parents didn't know it. And it took a long time to realise that we are in the concentration camp of Bergen-Belsen. More and more people started arriving. Then came the death marches. We started marching across Europe, and it lasted two weeks. 400km in an evening dress, in men's shoes, 20 below zero. Those who gave up or couldn't keep going, day and night, fell. They were shot and we went on. We marched for several hours. We found ourselves in Belsen concentration camp. Known to us as Vernichtungslager - they called it finishing camp. From there, there's no escape. In the winter of 1944, Belsen was officially designated a concentration camp. And the notorious Josef Kramer became commandant. In time, he would become known as The Beast of Belsen. The camp, originally built to hold just 10,000 people, now contained over 15,000. Enormous strain was placed on the camp's infrastructure. A gradual decline gathered pace. It got worse and worse, as more and more people were crowded into these huts. There would always be corpses around - either in the bunk or the floor, where they'd died. And we had to drag them out... ..which we did. Dragged them... ..by the ankles and then you could hear, because the floor was quite rough wood, you could hear their head bouncing along on the floor. Then drag them out to the door and somebody else would take them out and... ..put them on a heap. It was like something out of hell. I still remember the smell... ..which was horrific. It was not only... ..the smell of the human... ..excreta, it was the smell of bodies, of burning, of everything mixed up. To accommodate escalating prisoner numbers, in 1945, Belsen covered an area of nearly 600,000 square metres and comprised seven sub-camps... ..including the Hungarian camp, where Peter was detained. Looking at the vegetation here now, it is very difficult to envisage what the buildings looked like. They were rather low buildings. It was very crowded, it was very smelly. It was very unpleasant. Daily life centred around inside the barracks, and then we had to come outside. And we stood there, in the bitterly cold wind for hours, and that was how our day after day after day went. For a child, it was terribly boring. Peter was just five when imprisoned at Belsen. One of thousands of children who passed through the camp. Many of them orphans, fending for their lives. I heard there was a children's barracks somewhere in the camp. I quickly set out with my cousin, Anne, to find it. We found it and we were interviewed by two women. And they said, "We can take your cousin but you're too old anyway." Of course, my cousin wouldn't stay without me. She was absolutely adamant she wasn't going to stay, and they took pity on her, maybe on both of us. And they took us in. Belsen's children's barracks was a rarity during the Holocaust - an improvised orphanage where Mala and her cousin sought refuge. I actually thought that it was on this side because there wasn't a path. It was a very large barracks. It was number 211. And we had... ..you know, lots of children, about over 50. The barracks were run by Polish inmate Luba Tryszynska, who lost her own child to the Nazis. She became known as The Angel of Belsen. Compared with the main huts, it was like luxury. First of all, we weren't as crowded. And we were reasonably warm because there was a little furnace there. We were getting a little extra food when there was food. And we were being looked after. We weren't just two little girls on our own, fending for ourselves. Suddenly, someone cared about us. I mean, psychologically, it was also very important. Children sent to Belsen endured the most brutal of conditions, including the diarist Anne Frank and her sister, Margot. Both perished here. Anne Frank, unfortunately, was burning up from typhus. There was a partition, like a panel, and her bed was the other side. She was a beautiful girl, I'll never, never forget her face. I went to see her, and she was so delirious. And then she died. People would die like flies. My little sister, Millie, was born in Belsen. And... ..I wanted to give her a birthday present, you know, she was going to be a year old. So I found this carrot... ..and I'd got three little sticks that I put into the carrot, so it was a boat with three masts. And I kept asking my mother, you know, every day, "Is it her birthday yet?" "No, no, no. Not now, not today, soon." You know, and then I'd ask her again in a couple of days. "No, no, soon." Of course, it never happened. And... ..she died before I could give it to her. I remember this... ..tiny little wasted child, you know. And my other sister took her and put her on the heap with the other corpses. In a way, I felt like a failure, you know? I couldn't keep this little, tiny child alive. I remember... ..feeling really angry... ..I couldn't even look after my little sister. So that hurt, you know - that was painful. My father was a smoker. And he exchanged some of his bread ration for cigarettes. And he died of starvation. I... ..do remember that particular event because they came to us to tell my mother that my father died. But whether he was buried, or burnt in the crematorium, or ended up in a mass grave - that I don't know. In a way, it's impossible - we can't locate him. He died a month before Belsen was liberated. So when I look around and I see the graves with 2,000 or 5,000 dead, my father may be in one of those graves. By 1945, Soviet troops were liberating camps in Eastern Europe. The Nazis, realising their grip on power was loosening, transported many of their SS wardens to camps in the west. Among them, the young guard Irma Grese. She had worked at Auschwitz, where she was responsible for choosing victims for the gas chambers. You know, somebody like Irma Grese, how did she get into this position? She comes from a village somewhere, she's never heard of Jewish people, you know? And had a job somewhere in a factory, and then she was approached by people who were trying to recruit people to work in concentration camps, so she was offered a uniform... ..black boots... ..a dog, a gun, better pay. Fantastic. So she ends up as a guard, you see? Very proud to suddenly be in charge of other people! You know? I mean, look at the psychology of these people who worked in the concentration camps - it's very interesting where they all came from. So this Irma Grese was a very nasty piece of work. I was sitting on the floor by a bunk. And this woman walked in with her dog, a guard. And she'd got this big apple that she was eating. And she'd eaten this down to a fairly juicy core. And then she took the core and put it on the floor... ..and put the dog next to it to guard it - gave it whatever instructions to guard the thing - and then unleashed it and wandered off. And it had the apple core between its front legs, and it was sort of snarling and growling, and so on, but I knew very well that I couldn't make a grab for the apple core because that would be the end of me - it would literally tear me apart. And then she came back... ..and saw nothing had happened and thought this was very amusing. So...ground the apple's core into the floor, spread it around with her boots so there was nothing left there to even scrape up. Many years later, I... ..recognised who she was, and she was notorious. She is actually the one when obviously things were going badly for the Germans started talking to me. Unheard of! She said - and that I will never forget - she said, "Now we'll soon be home. We! We're suddenly "we"! We are the same group of species. "We'll soon be home." And I thought, my God, things must be going badly for you. "We'll soon be home." She was trying to make herself room in my heart somehow. Such a nice lady, you know, she was. She was such a bastard. By April 1945, Belsen's population had soared to over 44,000. Its infrastructure was now at breaking point. SS guards stopped bringing food to the camp, inflicting mass starvation. And when Allied bombs destroyed Belsen's water pump, the guards made no effort to collect water for inmates from a nearby creek. The camp had little or no sanitation. And disease - including typhus, carried by lice - was spreading rapidly. The organisation was breaking down completely. Typhus was raging. They were people but they were skeletons. And they were just shuffling along aimlessly. And they just... ..shuffle along and collapse and die. As thousands perished, help was close by. The Soviets were approaching from the east, and British and Canadian troops were just days away to the west. Realising their time was up, and in a final act of defiance, the SS decided to fill three trains with nearly 7,000 of Belsen's prisoners. Their destination? Theresienstadt concentration camp in Czechoslovakia. Peter Lantos was on the first train to leave. When it became clear that the British Army were going to arrive, the Germans decided to have three trains leaving Belsen. After a few days, the train stopped. And there was silence. And then we heard noises. And then we heard the language. And the language was different. It was not German. And that was when the Americans liberated us. Ultimately, only one of the three trains reached its destination. A third one - transporting Maurice Blik - was also liberated in transit. This time, by the Soviets. People didn't really know where the train was going. I expect the adults thought anywhere is better than Belsen, so we'll get on the train. I had my sixth birthday - unknown to me - on the train. From time to time, also it was shot up, presumably by Allied planes thinking maybe it was a troop train, or whatever. I climbed up on this seat and I could look through the window. And then I saw Russian Cossacks on horseback. These people on horses galloping towards the train. It was like the cavalry charging across the land, and riding on the train. Because of all the... Obviously, the adults knew what they were, they were all cheering and happy, you know, so it felt really good. At Belsen, where the allies were approaching, the Germans surrendered the camp. And on 15th April, 1945, British troops entered with no shots fired. MALA: I remember lying on my bunk. It was an upper bunk, by the window. And I remember people running. And this is a very clear memory. People running, and I didn't know where they were running or why they were running. I vaguely thought it might be to the gate. But all I could think of was, how have they got the strength to run? And that was 15th April, 1945 - liberation. Suddenly, you hear an English voice. I mean, it was unbelievable. "This is the British Army, we've come to liberate you. "Please remain where you are," you know? "Help is on the way." Well, you know, I can't describe that moment. That was... It was indescribable. You're still alive! And the British have come. I mean, a miracle. I remember British soldiers coming into Belsen and fainting because the smell was just... Can you imagine? There were thousands of rotting corpses lying about. The bodies were there. And we were used to it, you know? Body after body. We didn't even notice the smell. We've lived there for ages now. But when the British came, you know, I mean... These were all soldiers - they've seen a thing or two in the war - but nobody's ever seen anything like Belsen. I have just returned from the Belsen concentration camp. Beyond the barrier was a whirling cloud of dust. The dust of thousands of slowly moving people. And with the dust was a smell, sickly and thick, the smell of death and decay, of corruption and filth. I passed through the barrier and found myself in the world of a nightmare. As we went deeper into the camp, and further from the main gate, we saw more and more of the horrors of the place. And I realised that what is so ghastly is not so much the individual acts of barbarism that take place in SS camps, but the gradual breakdown of civilisation that happens when human beings are herded like animals behind barbed wire. We'd heard all these silly stories about the Germans and concentration camps and all the other, and we didn't believe it! We didn't! Nobody would do things like that! But, of course, they did. And we walked into it. Sorry, it tears the guts out of me now. Oh, hell. I walked around, and...that was... ..absolutely dreadful part of it. I mean, I... In the war, I'd seen quite a few... ..situations of carnage. But nothing - nothing on this scale at all. There were bodies everywhere. We got a bulldozer from somewhere, and they were digging enormous, big pits. Must have been about 12 feet deep, maybe 20-30 feet wide. And about 40 feet, 50 feet long. Enormous area with great mounds of - all that we dug out were put up on the top of the mound. And we just made the SS prisoners - that we'd taken prisoners, and the German prisoners that we had - we made those go and pick them up. We were a bit rough-handed. We were bloody angry, I tell you. The British were confronted by over 10,000 unburied corpses. They placed them in mass graves, marked with the approximate number of victims each one contained. Before liberation, when the Nazis did bury or cremate the dead, they made no effort to mark their resting place. To this day, over 25,000 victims remain unaccounted for. Another crisis for the British was how to contain the spread of disease, and treat the seriously ill prisoners. A further 14,000 of them died after liberation. Death and disease gripped Belsen, and soldiers had no choice but to burn it to the ground, destroying physical evidence of the Nazis' crimes. But their evil lives on in the memories of those who survived. When I was safe and looked after, I didn't want to live. I wished I had died with the rest of them, their friends and my sister in Bergen-Belsen. Because what am I doing here? Living for what? Living for whom? The big problem for the British was, what do we do with these people who are here - survivors? How do we sort you out? And of course they did the logical thing - to sort us into nationalities, with a view of sending us home. But when they asked my nationality, the problem started. "So what is your nationality?" "German." "Oh, German. Oh, well... "We'll send you home." Well, I wasn't going to go home. My home was in Breslau, which was Polish by then. 85% destroyed and nobody there anyway. So we started having a big problem being German - German Jews. You know, if you look back, of course, suddenly that you are Jews shouldn't matter any more. As if it didn't matter. Matters, too, these days. "So you're German, so you go back to Germany." "No, I don't want to go back to Germany. "I hate these people." So...a big problem, a big problem, what to do with...displaced persons. We became that new species - displaced persons. Where do we place you? So we come to a little bit of history. What happens then, logically? What do we do with these people who have survived? You've got to find somewhere. So we got Israel. And more problems. So that is history in a... in a nutshell. Returning to Hungary was, to some extent, a great shock. One of the tragedy was that my brother returned from hard labour and was going to start his studies at university. Unfortunately... ..he died. He returned from hard labour and he died a fortnight before my mother and I arrived back from Belsen. And my mother during the years probably recovered from Belsen, but she never recovered from the loss of my brother. More than 480 people had worked at Belsen, but in the autumn of 1945, only 33 of them were placed on trial. 11 of them were sentenced to death by hanging. Among them, Commandant Josef Kramer and SS guard Irma Grese. She was executed on 13th December 1945, aged just 22. By all accounts, she remained defiant until the very end. For survivors of Belsen, memories of Irma's evil aren't easy to erase. People ask very often whether you don't feel guilty for surviving. And a lot of people do feel guilty for surviving. But there must be a purpose in surviving because somebody has to survive to actually speak for the people who can no longer speak. This is how I feel about it. You know, this is now my... my purpose. I incorporated Belsen - the experience of Belsen - into my life. It lives with me. Without the place, something would be missing from your life. So Belsen was in a way, for me, the source of strength because it gives that feeling that you survived something extraordinary. It's that peace. It's just almost a sort of penetrating silence. So I'm thinking, well, they're resting in peace. I do believe that essentially the human race is about... ..going on and surviving and making a life, and... ..celebrating that. You know, there's a Jewish toast. I don't know if you know, when Jewish people make a toast, they say "L'Chaim", which means... It just means to... It just means "to life".
