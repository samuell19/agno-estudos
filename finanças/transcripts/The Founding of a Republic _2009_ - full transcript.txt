Director Chen, it appears you will kiss and make up with the CPC. You don't approve? You don't know the CPC like we do. While you were making passes at them, we fought them head on in France. I heard you intend to resign. Even if you resign, wait till after the capitulation ceremony in Nanjing You helped defeat the Japanese. The ceremony needs a national hero like you. If I don't resign, I'll be blamed for the civil war. Welcome, Mr. Mao Welcome to Chongqing, Mr. Mao. We've been fighting the enemy for 8 years. It's my job to fight till the end. Now that we won, why are we stilling fighting? I will not fight my own kind. General Malinovsky has agreed to hand over the Northeast provinces. No need to fight anymore? If we don't, will the CPC hand over their turf? Ladies and gentlemen. Chairman Chiang and Mr. Mao propose a toast To peace, cheers. Cheers. Chairman Chiang. Hello, Chairman Chiang Hello, Mr. Mao. I'm from the "Central Daily". I notice you're both wearing Mandarin suit. On a special day like today, is there a special meaning for that? The Mandarin suit is the official attire for all civil servants of the Nationalist Government. As the Chairman of KMT, it's my duty to welcome Mr. Mao to Chongqing. I'm wearing the Mandarin suit out of respect. Mr Mao, is that your reason too? The reason is simple Chairman Chiang and I are both Dr. Sun's disciples. Both the KMT and the CPC have inherited Dr. Sun's revolutionary legacy. We share the same roots. It is only natural that Dr. Sun's disciples should wear the Mandarin suits Mr. Mao. Excuse me. Pardon me, Mr Mao. To see you standing next to each other, I can't help but feel excited I have another question for Mr. Mao In the upcoming negotiation ith regards to the issue of democracy, will the Parties find common ground or reach any consensus? Definitely, if you look hard enough. This reporter already noticed we had something in common. The North China division of the CPC and the Shandong division are infiltrating the Northeast Chen Yi's New Fourth Army is active around Shanghai and Hangzhou, making it difficult for the Nationalist Government to move the capital back to Nanjing. Our troops are too far away from these regions. The Americans have landed in Qingdao. They promised to send planes and warships to get our troops to the Northeast, North China, East China and south of Yangtze River General Du, I'm counting on you in the Northeast Master Zhang, please give us your honest opinion. The CPC likes to keep things in the open. We never hide our views and respect those of our friends and the China Democratic League. Sir? Thank you. I'll be honest with you, as a friend. To form a democratic coalition government, peace and unity are the only ways forward. If Mr. Chiang and Mr. Mao can sit down and talk, it would be wonderful A negotiation requires concessions and compromises in order to bring about peace Chairman Mao came to Chongqing That alone proves our sincerity. The turf and army are minor details. Rather than haggle over them, why not unify all the parties? At this moment, the Nationalist Army is busy in regions where we have set up our regime with strategic blockades or explorative attacks. The Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army are thorns in Mr. Chiang's flesh. Pardon me for saying this If we didn't have a few hundred thousand used guns, Mr. Chiang would never sit down and talk to us. Ze If neither Party let go, the war will go on. You can forget about peace. If neither Party gives in, negotiation will break down. I appreciate your mediation. Very well. For the sake of peace and democracy, we'll make the first concession Among the 100 divisions of the national defense army, our request for 48 divisions has been cut back to 20 divisions We're willing to give up 8 liberated regions in south of Yangtze River. I hope that our concession will set the consultative meeting in motion and help set up a coalition government. I'm here on behalf of President Truman and the United States government to issue the following statement. We have no intention to support The present Nationalist Government of China and Mr. Chiang Kai-shek are faithful friends of the United States. Our only concern is whether the Yalta Conference and the Sino-Russian Friendship Alliance Treaty will be honored and implemented by the Chongqing government. The United States is cognizant that the Nationalist government of China is a one-party government and believes that peace, unity and democratic reform in China can be furthered if the basis of this government is broadened to include other political elements in the country. On behalf of the CPC, I wish to issue the following statement. We welcome President Truman's China policy as per the declaration on the 15th with regards to the cease fire between the KMT, CPC and other political parties and to call upon a multi-party meeting to implement reforms to end the KMT's one-party dictatorship and to ensure fair and effective representation of all parties to facilitate the democratic unification of China. President Truman's special envoy, Marshall, is arriving soon to mediate in the civil war. Don't slight him. Peace or war, you should know better. Stop when we want to stop Fight when we want to fight. This is the only case. Not until we say so. The purpose of this Assembly is to seek political reforms towards democracy. The basis of our negotiation is to establish a multi-party coalition government to facilitate a peaceful unification. Kai, there are over 30 seats in the Senate. We have to give up 8 of them? To give up 8 seats is to oust 8 of our men and hand them to someone else Who owns the world now? It's hardly KMT. Father Central Club and the others have secretly agreed not to acknowledge the CPPCC and refused to give up their seats for the CDL and CPC. There'II be trouble if they keep this up. Fellow students, teachers and friends of Sichuan. 5 months ago, we gathered here to celebrate a national victory. That's outrageous. Lower your whip. Mind your own business. She's my girl. You have no say Whoever feeds her, owns her Hey Stop it. Are you alright, Miss? Who fired that shot? Who was it? Who was it? Who fired that shot? Sir. No open fire in the city, Sir. But they can beat people up? I don't care who you work for. Send a message for me. Don't sneak around. Stop this underhanded nonsense Extra: Mr. Chiang calls for a meeting. Newspaper. Here Chiang has taken the gloves off. He's calling the National People's Congress without us. It's his one-man show. The sooner we set the date for the NPC, the sooner the US will confirm their assistance. We can't have the NPC with the KMT alone. We can forget the CPC. For appearance, we still have the other parties The CPC and the other parties insisted on implementing the resolution of the CPPCC in Chongqing. What will you do? Pacify Zhang Lan. Coax and fight the CPC at the same time. When Mao runs out of troops, we can stop coaxing. 4 days ago in Kunming, Mr. Li Gongpu was murdered by secret agents of the KMT. What crime has he committed to deserve such a fate? He used his pen and he spoke up. Everything he wrote and said was precisely what any Chinese with a conscience should write and speak of. What a shame. The counter-revolutionaries' shame is precisely Mr. Li's honor His blood will not be shed in vain Mr Li gave up his life There's a price to be paid for his life. Justice will prevail, because truth will prevail We want democracy, not civil war. Tell him I went out. Sir. The Chairman is not here for real. He sent me on an overseas expedition. I came to say goodbye to my sworn brother. But he's not here Vice President, why the lantern? It's broad daylight. Daylight? I see only darkness. I can't see without a lantern. You must be kidding, Sir. I'm not in the mood "The Three Principles of the People" is the cornerstone of our Party If he's bent on having his way, the days of our Party are numbered. That's all I have to say. Tell him to take care Zhangjiakou is the capital of the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region, it's also the only major city under the CPC that has an arsenal that's crucial to them. But it'll be returned to the Nationalist Government soon. General, are you saying the manufacturing and military base of the CPC doesn't exist any more? I admire Mao for never giving up. But talk is cheap and you can't just work your finger to the bone Power is everything. According to you, the Communist Party is doomed to fail this time? I didn't say that I'll make you a wager. The CPC wins, I'm willing to hold Mao's horsewhip. 20 years ago, we surrendered our arms for peace. What happened? We got a massacre in return, not peace. We learn from our mistakes For peace, for our future and to eliminate war. In this war imposed on us by our enemies, we must retaliate. Within 3 months of the closing of this NPC, our government will put an end to this civil war. We will annihilate the separatist regime by force of arms to bring forth a unified country and bring peace to our nation. Some say the evacuation from Yan'an marks a major setback in the Chinese Revolution. If this is a setback, our party and this army have survived countless setbacks. You keep the land and lose the people, you lose both. You keep the people and lose the land, you have both I'll trade Yan'an for the whole of China. We came all this way but we're still one step away from peace What a shame to give it up Mao was right: Without guns in their hands, Chiang will never negotiate with us The CDL served as mediator between the KMT and CPC. But Chiang is insatiable. The CPC gave up their turf, but they did not get the peace they wanted. Some guarantor I am. Chiang wants a one-party NPC. If neither the CPC or CDL shows up, we'll be handing the regime to him. Don't be stupid We'll fall into his trap if we show up. Our position is clear. Only a coalition government is legal There'll be no NPC without peace and no coalition government without political consultancy. You're saying... We side with the CPC I, Zhang Lan, will not attend Chiang's NPC. Based on the experience of the Northeast Bureau, we implement land reforms in the countryside. The results are quite obvious. Stay off the main road, take the vicinity of the city, give the land to the farmers. We'll take over when those who plough the land can own it The supplies unit got separated. We have problems with food and clothes. Zedong. Mr. Chairman. I need to write an editorial for the Xinhua News Agency. I need the rest of this candle for later But we're having a meeting. Precisely, just keep talking. You don't need to see anything Groping in the dark? Let's get back to business. Chiang threw caution to the wind and declared war. Bullets don't have eyes. In my opinion, Enlai, Bishi and I will form a front committee and stay in Shanbei Shaoqi, you and Zhu De form a Central Working Committee and cross the Yellow River into North China. We'll work from both sides Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Keep them separate. We'II still have the other when one is crushed Hurry. Get out Get rid of everyone inside. Seal up this place That son of a bitch He had the audacity to seize the CDL headquarters and restrict our activities. Li Jishen and He Xiangning set up the Revolutionary Committee of the KMT in Hong Kong. Founding members such as Feng Yuxiang and Cai Tingkai have indicated their intention to break away from Chiang The KMT is splitting up. You should leave for Hong Kong right away We'll re-open the CDL headquarters in Hong Kong But... I'm all for it We must not miss this chance. I hereby announce the results of the first presidential election of the Republic of China with the following votes: Chiang Kai-shek 2, 430 votes; Ju Zheng 269 votes. According to the constitution of the ROC and electoral law, I hereby announce Mr. Chiang Kai-shek is elected first President of the ROC Congratulations. Congrats Hu Zongnan wired. We lost Yan'an Chiang Kai-shek was elected President in Nanjing. Long live Mao Zedong in the valley. Nothing to brag about Get rid of the 'Iong live' in clause 23 of the slogan. Let Chiang be the emperor. I won't join his party Clause 5, mere mention of the working class is inappropriate. We have insisted on a coalition government It's bad to sing a different tune. I agree with the amendments. Let's have a show of hands Go on air with this. Xinhua Radio broadcasts the CPC slogan for Labor Day on May 1. First, this year's Labor Day is the day the Chinese people head towards victory. Second, this year's Labor Day is the day the Chinese people's enemy Chiang Kai-shek meets his doom. Fifth, all democratic parties and organizations should immediately call for the CPPCC to discuss and elect delegates to set up a coalition government. The CPC made an excellent move You're the chess expert. This time you must make up your mind. It's easier said than done. It'll depend on the CPC's next move I heard Li Zongren had invited you to Nanjing. Chiang wants you too. Li Zongren. Sun Ke Li Zongren. If the President is a litearati, I don't mind if you become Vice President But the President is already a soldier The Vice President should not be another soldier. People will say this is a military government Normally, I won't insist if you say so. But since the election, more than my effort is at stake. Not that I don't want to step down, I simply can't. Without support from the Party, you won't be elected. Why be a laughing stock? Let the numbers speak for themselves. Maybe I'll win. Definitely not. Sun Ke 1, 295 votes. Li Zongren 1, 438 votes. According to the constitution of the ROC and electoral law, I hereby announce, Mr. Li Zongren is elected Vice President of the ROC. I do solemnly swear... I haven't been to Beiping in years. Commander-in-Chief of North China. 5 provinces and a few hundred thousand people under your command. You're the king Don't make fun of me. Mr. Chiang has high regard for you. If the new CPPCC can invite half the people on this list, we're half way there. You're right. You better write to General Feng personally. I'll do that right now. Mr Chairman, time to eat Please join me, Enlai. No, I must get back to Xibaipo. Finish eating first Very well. Mr. Chairman, the cook is Xiao Yan's old lad He wants to see you Of course Thank you, sir. Hurry. His name is Guo Bencai. He's from my hometown. Hello, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Kwok, you're a good cook. It's worth everything to cook for you Have a smoke Thank you, sir. Why... It's your cigarette, I want to keep it. Take this. I can't. Take it. Sir, this is Liu Congwen, the mess officer in the military zone. Hello, sir. Hello. Hello, Mr. Zhou. Hello. Mr Kwok. Hello. Mr. Chairman, any special requests for your meals? We'II do the best we can. I don't need much. Make sure we put in chili. I prepared for you already. It'd be perfect if I can have stewed meat twice a month. Big fish in Chengnanzhuang In a bungalow between 2 apricot trees near the mountains in the northern part of the village Per your request, field operation units in Nanjing, Shanghai and Hong Kong have been removed. Zhang Lan is stuck in Shanghai. Keep him under tabs. Yes, sir Li Jishen is in Hong Kong He's not on our turf. Just keep an eye on him. Yes, sir As for Feng Yuxiang, he's getting tight with the CPC. He may defect If necessary, I'll tidy things up a bit These are prestigious men If you're sloppy, public opinion overseas will backfire on us I understand Mao's location is confirmed? Chengnanzhuang in Baoding. He won't get away this time. Remember, this is extremely important. Confirm target, roger Lao Guo, where are you going? This way. Back to the kitchen. Chairman Mao's food is on the stove Chairman? He took some sleeping pills and went to sleep. Wake him up. Enemy planes will be here soon. Tiger, get a stretcher. Wake up, sir. Enemy planes are coming. They haven't dropped a bomb. Then it'll be too late. Let's go, sir Calm down. Cigarette. Do that later. Commander Nie. Move Mr. Chairman to the bomb shelter on the stretcher Yes, sir Even if they start bombing, that doesn't mean they'll hit me I'm responsible for the Party I'm very lucky. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. Hello... Well? Still can't get through. Keep trying. Yes, sir Telegram, sir. Massive bombings, casualties unknown. The food was still on the stove when the bombing started. Lao Guo said you have not eaten breakfast He ran back to the kitchen Telegram, Mr. Zhou Mr. Chairman, we have very positive response for the May 1 slogan. The Parties have all signed their names. Already? What a surprise. The situation is becoming clear The CDL and the Revolutionary Committee are on our side. Chiang is now completely isolated. Everything will fall into place It's time to call for a new CPPCC. Jishen, Mao wrote you personally. What's your concern? Back in Fujian, we agreed to oppose Chiang. But they changed their minds Fujian was a few years ago. That was Bo Gu, not Mao. I'm not holding a grudge. I don't need another fall Chiang toyed with us for decades No doubt the CPC has better credibility, but what if... We just set up a new Party. As the Chairman of Revolutionary Committee of the KMT, I must do my best for the future of the Party Issue a separate declaration to oppose Chiang Reiterate our opposition against one-party autocracy. That'll be our response to the CPC. Nowhere inside the Shanhai Pass is a suitable venue for the new consultative meeting, except Harbin It's far away, but at least it's a big city. Feng Yuxiang will be home this month He'll go directly to the Northeast. Then let's settle for Harbin. To build a new government for the whole country without a decent big city, it's just not adequate Goods are scarce. Commodities entered the black market. Everyone is buying and selling short The top brass in the military and political circles are behind these activities. Those profiteers defy government orders. Mr. Weng can't hold the fort much longer. What's your solution? I don't want your complaints. I want a solution. As the financial center in the Far East, Shanghai is the key. If we can stabilize the market in Shanghai, the rest of the country will fall in line. I must go to Shanghai. Master Chiang, on behalf of Shanghai, we're hosting a banquet for you at the Jinjiang Hotel. I'll pick you up later Tell everyone on the Special Commando Unit to meet in my office in half an hour, including you In preparing for the new CPPCC, the CPC is open for suggestions. They don't intend to run the whole show. They do things differently from the Nanjing government What about Zhang Lan? He's always for building the state via CPPCC They already have a well thought-out plan to escort you and my mother up north. Mao invited you and Li Jishen up north to discuss re-opening the CPPCC. When is Li Jishen leaving? Don't know yet What's your answer? I have decided to stay put But... Let Shen Junru liaise with the CPC on behalf of the CDL When are you leaving? I'm too old and sick. Besides, Chiang won't let me go that easily. How can you not show for something this important? I'm putting Shen Junru in charge. I am Chinese. Is that right, Father? One stroke is missing. Isn't this pretty, Uncle Mao? Yes, but you can't eat everything. Mr. Chairman, it's time for the meeting. Let's go back Will you carry me, Uncle Mao? Carry me, Father. Will you carry me, Uncle Mao? Father Liya, do you want me to carry you? Yes. Let's go. Any news, Enlai? Chiang's economic reform is a deadlock. Chiang Ching-kuo personally flew to Shanghai. But the Bund is entrenched with powerful factions. It's a labyrinth within the KMT. Chiang's son won't accomplish anything. Liya, let's play piggyback. Yes. Let's go. No one should doubt the Government's determination to implement financial reforms. In face of a national crisis, anyone who compromises the nation's interest is a traitor and an enemy of the KMT I urge the elite of the business sector and prominent individuals of society to work with us to restore financial order and stabilize prices in the shortest time possible and do your best to save our country. Mr. Chiang Will you be fair? What about those offenders who have influence? How will you handle them? My mission in Shanghai is to hunt tigers, not squat mosquitoes. Mr. Chiang, can you tell us your concrete course of action? Tigers are easy to hunt but I'm afraid icebergs are hard to remove. You are... Du Yuesheng Mr. Du, I'm all ears My son Weiping has been arrested If he broke the law, I have no complaints, but someone else in Shanghai is hoarding supplies and peddling them to the black market for profits, openly defying the law If you choose to overlook this, President Chiang will be very disappointed. Please point me in the right direction, Mr. Du. I will look into it. Read it. 7 godowns along the Bund. The godown on No. 36 Nanjing Road. No 17 Avenue Joffre. 12 godowns in the South Market using the word "Jia" Mr. Chiang, this is the real tiger. Who is it? Yangtze Company owned by the Kung's. Wire Wei Lihuang, urge him to pull back south. With crack troops like these, even if we lose the Northeast, we can get it back easily. President, we wired him several times urging him to go south, but he ignored us. Get my plane ready, I'II fly out to Shenyang Yes. The President What is it? Feng Yuxiang is dead. Chairman. What happened to you? You bragged about your abilities. You bragged about Shanghai. You bragged about the Red Army. And now? General Feng was burned to death. You. This is all you can do Think it over. You won't get away. You'll be executed if you lose a battle. Now something went wrong on your front. Tell me what you should do. Speak up. KMT secret agents did it? According to the Russians, General Feng was watching a film in his cabin. The film caught on fire and ignited the cabin. The film caught on fire? He's a general. Why didn't he run? What a bunch of morons. A man is dead, the Russians need to blame someone. The ship was out at sea and abroad. We didn't get all the facts General Feng became a soldier at 12. 50 years in the battlefield didn't kill him But our invitation to send him abroad buried him at sea I feel so guilty General Feng may be dead but he left behind a legacy to build a new, independent China. Enlai, wire our condolences to Madame Feng and invite her to the CPPCC. Yes. Mr. Chairman, it has been suggested that the CPPCC should act for the NPC to elect the central government A general election is hard to come by during the war We must consult all the other Parties on this Let's not waste any time. Form the coalition government first, then call the NPC, is that it? Precisely They're still in a war They can't elect their delegates We should make allowances for that. I'll get in touch with Shen Junru and pass on your message. Mr. Mao and Mr. Zhou invited you up north again Assemble. Hurry. Search all the godowns, buildings, apartments and villas in Shanghai owned by Yangtze Company and the Kung's. Operation starts at 7 am tomorrow morning, understand? Mr. Chairman. Voices within the US government have indicated they will support your replacement of Mr. Chiang. What do you think? Whether they support me or Chiang, it's a cheap trick to pit Chinese against Chinese If the US wishes to maintain diplomatic relations with the future China, ignoring the CPC is unrealistic. The second question. If Vice President Li replaced President Chiang, will things get better? In terms of warfare, Bai Chongxi is quite capable. In terms of politics, Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi together are no match for Chiang. You did not answer my question, sir. Here What are you looking at? Jinzhou. That's over 1,000 km away. More definite news won't arrive until tomorrow. It's already 10:30 and yet no sign of attack. Which division was it? The 8th column. You asked me 5 times already Really? The Battle of Jinzhou is not just over a city or a region If we win, we can go on If we lose, the situation gets complicated With regards to the draft agenda of the CPPCC, Zhang Lan and Shen Junru made minor changes They know we're at war. They're being very understanding. Zhang Lan is sick. We should postpone his trip up north We must invite him. But we'll let him decide when to come. We'll wait. Aunt, he has full authority to seize everything owned by the Yangtze Company He put out word all over Shanghai looking for me Now I finally see him. That ought to save him some trouble. Have you gone mad, David? Relax. He's the Liaison Administrator, the prince. I wouldn't dare shoot the prince. This is very simple, cousin. Shoot me and it's all over With the culprit dead, you'll be famous in Shanghai. We'll both get what we want. Ching-kuo. It's clearly written in the state papers. You're needed for questioning within 10 days or you'll be severely punished. 7 days have gone by, you decide what to do next Yangtze Company is our family estate. I dare you to arrest my father. Nonsense. It's clearly your fault Leave your father out of this If he and Ai-ling found out about your monkey business, they won't spare you This is how we do business in Shanghai. But the arrival of a Liaison Administrator changed all that Auntie, everyone does it. That's the rule Only a feudalistic dictator would run a business without rules. Who are you calling a dictator? The government is fighting a war and soldiers are dying on the front But the state treasury is empty and we had to borrow from the Americans. Currency has depreciated and prices have skyrocketed. People are running scared. But inside your godowns, you hoarded over 100 thousand tons of supplies which you are unwilling to sell. I'm a businessman, not a philanthropist The CPC is working on land reforms and political consultation. Even Cai Tingkai and Shen Junru have left for the Northeast. Mao is setting up his own government. Madame, you've always supported Father. I bet you never expected right here in Shanghai, someone is undermining him, destroying the foundation of this country. Their fortune, apartments, clothes, perfumes and iceboxes are like a virus residing on the mere skeleton of this country. They are the enemy, Father's and the state's That's enough, Ching-kuo. There are no enemies here, only family. Let's talk about family today. I'm not in the position to say anything He Yingqin is the Director of National Defense Take pains to stay save. Let Chiang talk to him. You're a better marksman than He Yingqin. So what? Chiang owns China now. Even this gun has his name engraved on it What can we do about it? The CPC troops use this type of rifle too. What matters is not the name on the rifle, but the man who uses it Holding a rifle beats holding an empty title of Director of National Defense If you're the President, will the Americans back us up? Stuart dropped a hint. Then let's get rid of Chiang. It's still too early to say. Never too early to take precautions. It's time we get started Ching-kuo, Madam is leaving for the US tomorrow to ask President Truman for help. The situation in the Northeast is deteriorating quickly. We need help from the Americans I flew back from the Northeast just to tell you, at a time like this we can't afford a fire in the backyard. Father If we don't punish the Kung's, the economy in Shanghai is doomed. I absolutely understand The corruption of the KMT is in the bones. It's not just the problem of the Kung's Crackdown on corruption is a major issue Timing and extent are crucial... it's tough. You lose the Party if you proceed. You lose the country if you don't. It's tough. Father Both the Party and the country are on the brink of disaster. Alright The matter at hand is to move the troops up North to south of the Yangtze River to ensure the safety there Going after the Kung's is meaningless now. Zhang Lan is truly a saint of Sichuan. He deserves it. Without him at the CPPCC, none of us Sichuanese would dare to go. The Northeast is too cold for a man his age. He probably can't make it If anything happens to him... What about Beiping? What? Postpone the meeting till next year. Move the venue to Beiping It's possible. The troops are tired after taking Shenyang. Fu Zuoyi commands 600,000 men. Relying on 2 divisions in the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region to capture Beiping is impossible. According to our intelligence lately, Fu Zuoyi is having second thoughts. After the failed attempt on Shijiazhuang, he seems willing to negotiate Send someone reliable to liaise with him. Ok. It'd be heavenly, if we can liberate Beiping peacefully. Fu's daughter Dongju is a Party member. She's perfect for the job Yes. In that case, I'll be the dictator for a change. Ask the Northeast Field Army to enter the Shanhai Pass within 7 days. Tell Lin Biao this is an order and not a probe. It'll take a few days to gather up the troops and each column needs time to adjust otherwise. Moving inside the Pass will be a problem. The cadres don't want to make the move and it'll take time for deployment. The deadline on the 22nd is too tight. Wire this back: Received order dispatched on 18th at 18:00 Will set out on the 22nd as instructed. Details to follow Signed, Lin, Luo & Liu You should think for yourself too. You really want me to hold the horsewhip for your Chairman? Forget it, Father It was a joke. A joke? I personally told the American reporter. It's not a joke. That's because you took it to heart Li Jishen is a founding member of the Party who opposes Chiang openly Over these last few months, Mao has repeatedly invited him up north. He's been stalling him. He's bewildered by You come to see me with a 18-year old newspaper. How kind of you. The quarrel between you and the President should stay within the Party. Between you and the CPC, don't forget you ordered the execution of Cai Hesen. What are you saying? Return to Nanjing and pick any job you want, as long as you don't join the CPC A promotion for a promise? You think I'll go? Before I came, Vice President Li told me he would like to liaise with the CPC through you. Any condition is negotiable, including using the Yangtze as a partition. Use the Yangtze as a partition and split up China? Tell Li Zongren The infamy is more than he can handle. Hello, Mr President Commander Fu. Our troops can pull back to Tanggu and Zhangjiakou I can't guarantee we'll win But we're perfectly capable of defense. With the big picture in mind. I intend to move 600,000 men to Jiangnan I can be more flexible in both defense and offense That's containing our sovereignty to the southeast. As the old capital, Beiping has political significance. Giving it up is unfavorable to our government internationally You're right. International scope is the situation. Wait. What is it, Father? Who's your commanding officer? We agreed not to discuss that I wish to talk to them. About what? The horsewhip? What I'm telling you now will determine the lives of millions. I understand She's so hot. I'm sorry, May-ling. Both the House and the Congress have refused your request to make another speech. But the Government will still support the General as before with the hope that the civil war does not continue any longer in China. President Truman and his administration is concentrating on Europe. But the East needs a revival too. My friend. China should have been included in your plan. Any loans and assistance from the US now should be spent on security and constructive activities, not war You got 400 million dollars from the original loan. That's still in existence. We both know there's only a few million dollars left. And it's not enough to support my husband's administration and his life's work. Mr. Secretary of State, we need your additional assistance, please. Madam, there's nothing more we can do. New Year is coming up. Make this announcement at month end. About what? If they want me to resign, I'll resign. You can't do that, Mr. President. It's not my choice. But someone within our Party wants me out. You repeatedly rejected Mao and Zhou's invitation. You're too arrogant. That's an overstatement, Madame Liao. I'm tied up at home And I'm also busy with military affairs Preparations for the new CPPCC are moving along and days are counting. After decades, the KMT can't be absent You're still hesitant about going. You expect Mao to fly to Nanjing to invite Chiang? We're definitely not inviting him. He's a war criminal, a murderer. We can't have a CPPCC without the KMT. Jishen, Chairman Mao said he'd wait for you in Beiping. Chief, some landlord's compound up ahead The wall is too high for us to climb over. Grenades won't blow it apart. Please send for the artillery. Flare Flare Commander... we have reached Beiping city 2 pieces of good news, sir First, Li Jishen, Shen Yanbing and Zhang Naiqi left 4 days ago. They boarded the Aldan and will disembark at Dalian day after tomorrow. And the other one? Chiang Kai-shek resigned Mr. Ambassador. As China's ally, why is the US doing nothing at a time like this? God help those who help themselves, my friend I think Chiang is giving Li Zongren a hard time. He knows Li wants to negotiate, so he brought it up first. He doesn't want Li to get the credit and he wants to give us a hard time. He already stepped down, but he had to pull a stunt like this. After this, it would be tough for Li to talk to us. The CDL and the other Parties have yet to make a stand, they're waiting to see. In my opinion, deep down they want us to talk. Li Zongren wants peace, we want peace, the other Parties want peace. We'll do the Acting President a favor Great. Let's give him a chance to talk, but we decide how. Victory bulletin... War communique from Huaihai According to the wire, 550,000 enemies were killed and Du Yuming was captured. What about the New 5th and the 18th? Gone. The 5 major divisions were wiped out. Chiang is finished for good. There'll be no more fighting north of the Yangtze. Cheers. This is the last battle. We stay united till tomorrow. Internationale will come true. This is the last battle. We stay united till tomorrow. "Internationale" will come true. Father, it's cold on the ground. Sit down. Ching-kuo. You did a good job in Shanghai. I'm very pleased. I made Chen Cheng Governor of Taiwan. Do you know why? Your route of retreat? Yes, Du Yuming's men were wiped out. I lost all the men who can fight. We can't count on the 1 million men we captured in Jiangnan They can barely hold their rifles The Yangtze is lost. You intend to evacuate to Taiwan? You're coming too. You think Li Zongren won't get anywhere with the CPC over the peace negotiations? If we can't defeat them at war, we won't beat them at the conference table Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi thought the CPC will settle for using the Yangtze as a partition They don't know Mao Zedong. Mao will never agree to separate governments on both sides of the Yangtze? Would you accept if it were you? That'd depend on the US and the USSR... Don't make it so complicated. It doesn't matter what anyone thinks China was split into north and south in the past but not today. Who would want to be blamed for it? Definitely not me Mr. Zhang Lan Right now, in your opinion, will the CPC accept the Government's plea for peace? Impossible. Why is that? If Chiang never gives up his so-called constitution, The CPC will not recognize it and neither will the people. You know Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai very well. Are they local revolutionaries or mere agents working for international communist intelligence bureau? What kind of question is that? I want to know your view. My view is that the CPC catered for the people which explains their achievements today. Achievements? Yes, achievements. Dear Zuoyi You and I have come a long way. Given the circumstances, you took matters into your own hands. There's nothing I can do about that, but I have one request. I will send planes to Beiping tomorrow to airlift officers of the 13th Army ranked Major or above and essential weaponry On account of our long standing friendship, please help me out. Chiang Chung-cheng. Beiping fell Fu Zuoyi surrendered. The CPC is moving in on the Yangtze and Nanjing. With regards to my plea for peace, the CPC accepted it but raised 8 very harsh conditions. Madame, if you speak on behalf of the Government, Mao and Zhou may trust me. As you know, Mr. Acting President, I washed my hands in politics since the onset of the civil war. There are rumors in the newspapers about me coming out of retirement. The Trust had to issue a denial. Madame. Dr. Sun founded the KMT. You can't sit back and watch it go to ruin. Don't forget, you may be the Acting President, but Chiang Kai-shek is still the Party Chairman. Looks like the Acting President is having a hard time. Chiang stepped down in name only He still has control of everything. Li Zongren does not have enough authority. He's only a puppet Nothing will come out of the negotiation. No wonder you turned him down I don't want to go to Beiping because Dr. Sun died there. Too many memories. Master Zhang, you're a veteran of the United League and Zhu De's mentor Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu have great respect for you. The Acting President issued a declaration for peace negotiation You're the most suitable person to mediate. If the CPC brought up 8 conditions, go ahead and talk to them. If Mao wants to talk, he wouldn't raise these harsh conditions. There should be room to negotiate in a negotiation. That's why the Acting President sent me to haggle with them To mediate. As you know, the Government clamped down on the CDL. It is now an illegal organization I'm now in the same party as the Communists. Please don't be upset, sir. Mr Chiang issued that order, not the Acting President. I side with the revolutionary. I won't haggle for the enemy Sir. See them out A partitioned rule? China is not Korea. The Yangtze is not the 38th Parallel. Wire the General Front Committee. Their war plan has been approved The central government advises to move the plan up to end of April Go Hurry Are you ok? Don't push Lin Biao is still so skinny. Eating 1 million Nationalist soldiers didn't even make him fat Comrades On behalf of the Secretariat of the Central Politburo, I hereby announce the commencement of the second meeting of the 7th CPC Central Committee. What should we do about Zhang Lan? He'd rather die than go to Taiwan. He's trouble to us if he stays. Give him what he wants Sir. Get rid of Zhang Lan. He's a man of influence, sir The more reason to get rid of him. I see Openly or privately? How can you do this openly? Like I said, don't let me see him alive. And no body if he's dead. Don't make a mess. I understand Go on. Take care Stop Get out. Are you Zhang Lan? Who are you? What do you want? Deputy Chief Yan Jinwen of the Shanghai Inspectorate On behalf of the CPC, I will get you out Trust me. Brother Yan. Morning, you're on duty? Security has been tightened lately Where are you going? On Inspectorate business. Mixing pleasure with business. My father is in the car. Go ahead, do what you have to No need, run along Bye. Let them through Where are you taking us? Up north Enlai, where's the Chairman? Went to get smokes. Not a shop is open in two blocks. Chengjun, you're the county committee secretary. This can't go on. After entering the city, rumor has it capitalists and businessmen are exploiters and we should punish them. They're so scared no one is open for business. This is not a small matter. Revolution is our forte but not economics. Can't even get smokes without the merchants, let alone market prosperity. We need the capitalists back. At this stage, we can't eliminate them yet. Production must be handled with care. If anything goes wrong, it'll be worse than losing a battle. We must know our limits We must learn from scratch. The gist of political consultation involves capitalists and democracy activists. We invite them to help run the country, not to eliminate them. We must be very clear on this: If we destroy them and we can't run production on our own, factories will close down and worker will lose their jobs. We'll be smashing our own rice bowls. We barely got our hands on them, don't smash them. Comrades, we ask two things of you. Keep your backs straight and your voices up, understand? Yes. Chairman Mao General Fu, you flatter me. I promised to hold your horsewhip if I lose. Today, I'll hold the door for you. You did not lose The loser is in Nanjing. Don't hold the door for me Help me open the door for a new China. Salute Sir. I'm with the 28th Army I'm here with the Tashan troops to join the dress parade. On behalf of soldiers of the Red Army, dead or alive, I salute you, Chairman Mao. Forward... Forward... Forward... Long live Chairman Mao Are these the 100,000 used guns you mentioned in Chongqing three years ago? The CPC has come a long way Long live Chairman Mao Long live Commander Zhu Long live Chairman Mao Long live Commander Zhu Long live Chairman Mao Since they're crossing the Yangtze River anyway, what the hell is the point of negotiation? To surrender before the fight begins? I'm a soldier, I won't do it. The CPC knew you're different from Chiang. Mao knows you enjoy being in the army. He personally told me you might continue to command the troops up to as many as 400,000 Nonsense. I'm already the Minister of National Defense. Zongren, we don't get along with Chiang. That's our internal business. It's not up to the Communists to jack us around. What's the use of saying that now? What are you suggesting then? Let's wait for word from Xikou. 300,000 courageous PLA crossed the Yangtze River on the 21 st. The campaign started at midnight on the 20th. Didn't even hold the defense line for one day. He Yingqin is retreating. They say to Guangzhou. Shall we go with them? I have to look after the interests of the United States I should stay here in Nanjing. I heard the Soviet embassy had relocated to Guangzhou with the Government. Morning, Madam. Morning The sound of gunfire went on all night. It finally stopped. Madam, you didn't sleep well. I'll go for a walk. Have you decided to leave? Really? Hello, Chairman Mao. Hello, Chairman Mao. Hello Jishen. Mr. Zhou. This way, please. Chairman, Zhang Lan is here. Mr. Mao, you flatter me Not at all. Master Zhang, how are you? Mr Zhou Welcome, please come this way. Hello, Master Zhang. Calling the CPPCC to establish a new people's Government, I recommend you both for Vice Presidents. I'd like to hear your opinion. I'll go along with your arrangement. You have something to say? Is this your idea? The Central Committee's idea I killed members of your party. That was then, this is now. All roads lead to Rome. We can't change history. Nobody's perfect. A personal matter, no matter how important, is a minor issue. A state matter, no matter how trivial, is a major issue, For the new state, be our Vice President on behalf of the Revolutionary Committee. This is a state matter Forget the past. The CPC is willing to work with you to lead this country. Let's help each other, as we're in the same boat now Together, we'll make history. As you wish. I'll do my best for China. We strongly urge our comrades in China to set up their own government soon The USSR will, at the earliest time possible, set up diplomatic relations with the new regime. That's wonderful. The frantic bombing of Shanghai by the KMT is causing chaos. I'm worried about Madam Sun's safety. She's our most faithful friend when we were in dire straits The new CPPCC is about to commence. It won't be complete without her. Men like us won't know how to talk to her. Send a female comrade to escort her here. Enlai, we'II burden Yingchao with the task Good idea. Madam Zhou to escort Madam Sun. I'll tell her right away. To form a coalition government without you is something the Party will never agree to. Neither would the rest of the country I'm only the vanguard If I failed to convince you, Enlai would be next and then Chairman Mao himself. If we all failed to convince you, we'd put this on the agenda of the CPPCC, vote on it and send a delegation. You Communists won't stop until you get what you want. What do you think of this house? Not bad, spacious and bright. Mayor Chen Yi said he'd giving it to you as a permanent site for the youth center of your China Welfare Fund. The children can play in here every day. That's wonderful. Madam Sun Times have changed, Zedong. You mustn't do that. Only for Madam Sun. Thanks for the invitation and Yingchao's company. Now the Party can work with all delegates to build a new state, I must thank your help and support. You have been a great help to the country and its people and a benefactor of our Party. Fellow delegates, the yellow flag pole in the center of figure No 1 represents the Yellow River. It stands out. Those in favor, please raise your hands. Good. It's unilateral. I object. From an artistic perspective, No. 32 is much better. Mr. Tian is an artist who's partial to the 5 stars. The person who submitted this design is an ordinary clerk from Shanghai It was disqualified in the first round, but I want to bring it up again. Because this design is full of emotions. I object to the version of the 4 stars representing the 4 classes. I prefer the Yellow River pattern. Simple and sharp. How many in favor of the 5-star flag? Delegate Xu Beihong suggests we use "March of the Volunteers" as the national anthem Let's hear your comments The melody is good, but we need to change the lyrics. This is a new China. The original lyrics are outdated. Mr. Tian Han, you're the lyricist. What's your opinion? I should refrain from commenting. I'll listen to the others. I agree we should change the lyrics We can't sing it every day, especially this line: its greatest peril." It won't work I disagree, "La Marseillaise" of France is tragic but has been handed down till now That's France, not China The lyrics of the song remind us not to forget the past. I agree New China needs a new song for its new outlook. Why use a song from an old movie? What about you, Mr. Li? was written for the war I sang it before. It's inspirational and gets my blood boiling. become our new Great Wall". We must remember history. No need to change the lyrics. Well said. Agree. I have a good sense for danger too The Chairman wishes to keep the original lyrics. What about you? You kept raising your hand. They took the words out of my mouth I have no comment. Let me say just one thing. To be vigilant in peace time is what a mature nation should do We'll let Mr. Tian Han decide Then let's keep the lyrics. Chairman Mao, fellow delegates. Are you ready? Look over here, ready. This is a women's delegation. Chairman, everyone is talking about the pattern on the national flag. What do you think? I like the Yellow River. I disagree. Can you fix the negative? Yes. Take out the person next to me. There are over 10 people next to you. I mean the man who jammed in Alright. Thank you What's your reason? Chairman, adding a pole to the middle gives the impression of splitting up the country. Is that the right interpretation? Can't be that serious. Most people prefer this one Gong Peng, what do you think? We like No 32 Placing five stars in the left corner with four small stars surrounding and their tips pointing at the big star It looks pretty. Chairman, the big star in the middle represents the Party while the small ones represent the 4 classes The symbolism is correct. Looking at this flag makes one feel enthusiastic. Enthusiastic? I feel excited when I look at the flag. Madam Sun likes this design too. You have been abroad, your opinion should count Please tell us what you think. The five stars design is a good representation of China's situation. Under the leadership of the CPC, all the classes are united to build a new China The color is sharp, solemn and grand. The truth is, China is united. Well said. We're united now and we'll always be in the future. Is the air raid on Beiping feasible? The Chairman wants feedback from the Air Force. The flying radius is too big. The planes must re-tank somewhere or they won't make it back. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has liaised with the Americans in Korea You can rest assured. But the CPC has its air force now. The Chairman only wants to know if the air raid is feasible. That's all. Despite the difficulties, as long as he issues the order, we'll get it done. Fellow delegates, the CPPCC that the whole country is looking forward to will now commence. The new CPPCC will commence on a brand new foundation It represents the Chinese people and has the people's faith and support Therefore, the CPPCC hereby announces its right to call this meeting Fellow delegates, we have a consensus that our work here will go down in history. It proves that China, which accounts for 1/4 of the world's population, is finally on her feet The destiny of China is in the hands of her people China will rise like the sun in the east. Its radiance will illuminate the land and cleanse the filth and mire left behind by the reactionary government. Heal the wounds of war and build a brand new and powerful People's Republic of China. Long live the People's Republic of China. Long live the Coalition Government. Long live the unity of the people According to Commander Zhou, the planes are in Class A status. They're ready to bombard Beiping any time. But the US has turned down our request to refuel in Pusan. What does that mean? They can't come back after takeoff. What time is Mao's founding ceremony? 3pm at Tiananmen Square. It's fate. The KMT is ruined with our own hands Cancel the mission Yes, sir The People's Republic of China and the Central People's Government have been established today
