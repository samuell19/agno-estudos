The Secret Life of Pets 2 Subtitles by Magnus Maximus ♪ Empire State of Mind • JAY-Z ♪ Ahh... kids. Everybody loves them right? You probably love kids. I gotta admit, I don't. That's me by the way. I'm Max. I'm the little dog, right there. Grateful I'm not being piled on by a horde of children. Ugh, can you believe that? Ha ha. Having a kid looks like fun. Nah man, it ain't fun. I'm telling you, once the humans bring a kid home, your life ain't the same. I've seen it a billion times. It changes you. Now, I thought I'd never have to worry about any of that, but then, one day... My owner, Katie... Met, Chuck. Are you OK? Ahh... Ah, yeah. A little while later, they married. Which... it's, it's great. Chuck is really... he's a good guy. But then... Something happend. Katie and Chuck had a kid of their own. His name's Liam. At first, he slept all the time. Dreaming about, you know, whatever it is that babies dream about. He had his place... and I had mine. Things, seemed like they were going to be fine. Until he started talking. And eventually, he started crawling. Sort of. And suddenly my own home wasn't safe anymore. There was a tiny monster taking it over. Now, I did my best to keep a safe distance... Then one day, Liam did something I never expected. Max! I love you, Max. And from then on, everything was different. Duke and I, we became like role models to him. And what can I say, the kid's a fan. We'd try to be a good influence. And we'd help him out whenever we can. This kid gets us. Bubble... Yeah, we have fun. And, by the way... I'm still, not a kid person. I'm talking about this kid. This is my kid. He is perfect. And I'm never going to let anything bad happen to him. But I gotta say, keeping Liam safe is a full time job. No, no no no... Alright, ah... Everything's cool... We, we don't want any trouble. Liam! You OK there buddy? Is the world always this dangerous? The Secret Life of Pets 2 Subtitles by Magnus Maximus Agh... No No No No No... Don't... Good morning, Snowball. Who's the best bunny in the whole wide world? Yeah... Pow! Ears up!

So, ahh... did your kid leave for school yet? Yeah, yeah. No, she's got a quiz today. And they in spellin'. She'll ace it though. Do you know she writes her answers down in ink? That's how confident she is. That sounds really smart. But you know what? Liam is smart too. In fact, I heard Katie say, that Liam's head circumference is in the 80th percentile. Oh, that's cool. That's a lotta head. Hey, quick question. Is he still peeing everywhere? Can't control his bladder? Yeah, he... he's peeing. But, but every pet knows, if you pee on it, you own it. And Liam, he's just thinking ahead. Yeah, but you still better train him before pre-school starts. You don't want Liam to get a reputation as one of those pee-pee kids? Yeah, totally... Hey, wait... pre-school? Yeah, he's around that age. The baby bird is leaving the nest. No, no. Baby bird is staying put. Doesn't need pre-school. You know, Stay home with me, where it's safe.

What's the problem? - Well, he could fall. - He might. And then he hurts himself. Oh, so he got really high up, in this hypothetical tree? Kid gets hurt, he learns not to do it again. You know how many electric cords I've chewed? Like, multiple cords? One. It shocked me. I walked backward for a week, but I never chewed a cord again. That is great for you, and, and it explains a lot. But I like to protect Liam from... from everything? Well, that's you, and you're wrong. - Can you believe that guy? - Yeah, he was cool! - No, he wasn't. - I know, wasn't cool at all. Come on. Whoa, hold up there.

Oh yeah. First mission in the bag. It was easy... too easy? Maybe... maybe it was. Hey big dog, what'd I do? Well, I just rescued a tiger. And I'm not even tired of breath. I'm just telling you what happened. You're so god damn awesome. When you're awesome, and you just tell the truth, it sounds like you're bragging. Let me know when you're finished tooting your own horn. 'Cause we gotta find a safe place for Hu. Ahhh, What? What're you talking about? Oh yeah... Oh that guy. Yeah, ahhh, yeah...
