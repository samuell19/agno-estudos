It was long ago. In the year 1925. The city was Paris. Here, the rails coming from the east converged: Berlin, Warsaw, Bucharest. And then, the train from the furthest land, Russia. The gauge of the rails was different. The man arriving in Paris that day was Nestor Ivanovich Makhno. Nestor, son of Ivan. A peasant in his country called Ukraine. He arrived here after three years as a wandering refugee in Roumania, prison in Poland, [...] trials, pursued by an extradition request. It was refused, as a diplomatic note said, If he returns to his country, he together with... his wife and daughter risk the death penalty. The Anarchist Message, first issue. With address 14 Paradis Road in Berlin. July 1923. We start today the publication of memories of Nestor Makhno, a document of exceptional value for all who are interested in the personality of the author and the role that his movement plays in Ukraine within the Russian revolution. Chapter one. Some episodes of my life before the 1917 revolution. My father was a former serf on properties in Minsk and lived in a second property to this sphere. This story started in Berlin. Nestor Makhno will pursue him here in Paris until his death following nine years of nocturnal writing behind the narrow windows of makeshift rooms. He abode behind the windows of the Tenon hospital near the Père Lachaise cemetery. This story is about the insurrectionary Makhnovist peasant movement from Ukraine, commonly called the Makhnovshchina, who from February 1917 until the end of the Russian civil war in 1921 succeeded to embrace over two million men and women in a territory half the size of France between the Don and the Dniepr, the two rivers of the legendary Cossacks. In 1957, Mosfilm studios released the screen adaptation of the famous Tolstoy novel "The Path of Suffering". It became the official version of the civil war. Third episode, a dark morning. We are in Ukraine in 1918. The October revolution lasted one year until autumn. The great war is over, but the civil war is already a threat everywhere. It's market day in Gulyai-Polye. The peasant chief: Nestor Makhno. Batko Makhno, he was having fun and drinking. Few people understood he was buying time. He had to make a decision. The enemy was advancing. In the Krim, Denikin, in the north, the Bolsheviks, and on the Dniepr, Petlyura's army. Who to turn the guns to? More than half a century later, market day in Gulyai-Polye. We know one thing. He defended the poor like a mountain. Understand? Then, he disappeared. Everyone was after him. Gulyai-Polye was a republic. They stole land with their bayonets. They turned on their gramophone. They danced on our fathers. Yes, it was Makhno. Makhno is good, unlike nowadays. Youri A. Makhno (grand-nephew of Nestor Makhno) I work. I live. I tend a garden. I grow onions. What else? It's ok. Life goes on. Everything's rolling, as they say. I'm not married yet. My grandmother wants me to, but I don't feel like it. My mother would tell that he was not a bandit, as he was called. Yes, as he was depicted. He never shot anyone over nothing. He was the first who organised a commune, in Gulyai-Polye. He took cows and horses from the rich for the commune. For the poor who had nothing. But the commune didn't last long. The revolution was on and all that... Viktor I. Ialanski (grand-nephew of Nestor Makhno) There, during the war my mother buried documents Then she gave them to me. Five brothers, all broke by history. The two elders Karpa and Emilian were shot in front of their house because their names were Makhno. The two youngest, Sava and Gricha, killed while fighting asides Nestor the younger. There is a Makhno square in the Gulyai Pole cemetery. Here at the day of the dead, which is also the day of spring, it is not the living who come to greet the dead. It is the dead returning, to share a meal with the living. Here rests his older brother Karpa. There, his son. There is neither uncle Sava, nor Gricha. Nor uncle Nestor. The only monument in the region carrying the name of Nestor Makhno is 20 km from Gulyai Pole. Here, buried are among red army soldiers killed during the civil war by the hand of Nestor Makhno in 1920. Serious words, engraved for eternity. The words we speak blow in all directions and everything then starts moving. They took the grandmother. They were inside and soldiers guarded the door. My mother pushed them around and she returned home. The chief sits screaming at grandmother, banging his fist on the table. My mother looks at him en tells him: "Listen Mykola..." She recognised him. He was with Makhno. They made a wedding together in the village. "Why at the time did you not tell him..." who was on the wrong track?" If there would be the Makhnovshchina I would go headfirst into it. It's true Life is so boring. During my youth I was a coach. I did competitions. We'd all heard about it, we'd seen him in films. Michail Mykoloavitch our [...] has for ten years been roaming the villages, collecting cross-cutting testimonies, This is Makhno. Makhno and the insurrection That's what we need to talk about. It's a very important topic. Even the children of Gulyai Pole price shooting is linked to the history of Makhno - his version. Just ask the right questions. Three colours: red, white and the black target. What is it? What makes the mills turn? What falls asleep [...] There is even the poem cat everyone here knows by heart. He wore a gold chain. It goes right and the song starts. He goes to the left and the story is told. In the beginning a word. The earth. As immense as the word. So rich that the invaders take it by whole carriage. Ukraine. On the verge. If we cross and meet and trace the invaders. That of ancient Cossack republics. And that of the Cossacks who became mercenaries. That of peasant revolts. That of colonists, that imperial powers sent people and the steppes that were called [...], The wild fields domesticated, who are crossed across languages ​​ different in name, and the earth and the sky which it borders. In Polish, in German, in Russian, in Greek, in Yiddish, in Ukrainian. In the centre a village called Gulyai-Polye, meaning the free field. The one we know but that we [...] Fairgrounds and a large peasant market. At the beginning of the century Gulyai-Polye counted 16.250 inhabitants. Three churches, including one with three bell towers, a synagogue, five agricultural schools, three high schools a German school, two Jewish schools, a library, a theatre. There were three mills, foundries, of which the largest was the Kerner plant. Ivan Radenovic Makhno, Nestor's father, when freed from serfdom committed himself as coarse from Mr. Kerner the owner. Then he died, leaving a widow and five landless growing sons. Nestor the younger works as an apprentice in this factory, where before being a worker, all here were peasants. It is also in this factory that at lunch break in a traditional section brought back from Paris texts by Nestor Makhno, discovered for the very first time by whom those had been written for. It's the history of Ukraine. What else would you want? My eyes hurt from reading. -See what you understand. Are there images? I will read aloud The Makhnovist insurrection in Ukraine. "I want to warn the reader..." "that the absence of certain resolutions..." "by the Peasants Union of Gulyai Pole..." "by Soviet peasant and worker deputies..." [...] always attached with admirable consistency in bringing together the peasants and workers in this region, explaining to them the meaning and scope of events. The exposition of workers in general and that of anarcho-communists that resembles the mentality of peasants in particular. "Unfortunately I don't have photographs of these unknown revolutionaries." "My peasant friends arose from the most deep of the Ukrainian people." "They were genuine peasants," "not knowing how to lie or deceive, it was hard to convince them." "But once they had grabbed the idea and had verified it with their" "own reasoning, they exalted this new ideal everywhere, at every occasion." "My only regret: that their memoires never emerged in Ukraine." "The fault were circumstances I couldn't do anything against." Nestor Makhno, Paris, 1926 I was a history teacher, here at this school. I taught for over thirty years. During all these years I practised my profession, I collected documents about the civil war in our region. This file contains the most interesting documents: the programme of the anarchist movement. Today it appears to us not as it was presented to us, but as it actually was. We are at the very beginning of the century, at the new Kerner factory. Nazar Zuichenko is an apprentice [...]. He is fourteen years old. His story was preserved miraculously and passed on from father to son. In Gulyai-Polye we had a very advanced amateur theatre group that I was part of. One day a young Nestor Makhno came to see me at the workshop to ask me if he could join. I was a little surprised by his minute size. And that's how we met. The workers factory, land of the peasants. Land of the peasants! is already a modern phrase. There is an other, older phrase, born in the last century. [...] wrenching how to serfdom. Land and, and what..? How to translate the word used [russian word] that means both freedom, free will and limitless space. I will read aloud documents from the period of the 1905 revolution in our region. "I have the honour of informing your Excellency" "that according to my information on the lands of the owner Masaracki" "they are illegally distributing flour and fodder." In Gulyai-Polye the Union of Poor Peasants (SBH) is founded around the young peasant Valdemar Antoni of Czech parents, who had lived an urban life and upon returning had joined a group of anarchists. Revolution. The apprentice hall with the whole theatre group of the factory joins the movement. Among them is Nestor Makhno. He is 16. Zarathustra. This is how we called Antoni who brought us books, food and also weapons for the revolutionary battle. Nearly every evening we peasants having little knowledge, we would gather in a meadow or in a farm, in a barn for books and For me the evenings were full of light and joy. We read everything: Proudhon, Bakunin, Kropotkin, the history of culture. Above we are all passionate about astronomy, the planets, the stars and the story of the appearance of man on earth. The owners responded by creating the union of genuine people. Its workers too were genuine. Their slogan was simple. "Kill the Jews, save Russia", and they organised pogroms. Halt! Late and against the odds we decided to fight them. The genuine Russians returned home. It was our first victory. May 1, 1907. A day of banned demonstrations in Gulyai-Polye. All persons here are wanted by the police. This is their first souvenir photo. Then, on event after the other. The repressive order is restored. Clandestinity, denunciations, shootings, arrests, death sentences. Fifty days pass. The majority are descended in the grave. The death penalty for Nestor Makhno is commuted to a life sentence. He writes: I swim [...] he incessant demarches of my mother. The rails those years cross between but meets them again the destinies of whole generations In the north a student revolutionary Vsevolod Eikhenbaum (Voline) level sailing line freedom stopped escapes. To the south a locksmith Peter Arshinov of art china the measure of the earth made stop He is transported to the same political prison of Moscow to which the peasant Makhno is transferred. They would be three, each writing in their own way The [...] Makhnovist. Nestor Makhno, footwork, tuberculous and a political prisoner, in a place of books. The prison library is powered by the [...] and the rich. I've read everything: history, geography, and especially mathematics. It's through the books that Nestor Makhno meets Peter Arshinov and his unbreakable dream, a libertarian printing press. The texts of the Makhnovist movement have not completely disappeared thanks to him and his ink-stained fingers. Germany and its allies declare war. Russia mobilises. 1915, 1916, 1917. The February revolution The czar abdicates. The prisons open. Sometimes they burn. Amnesty for politicals, who leave in the day in processions still under escort. Without doubt Nestor Makhno is present, among the 'returned from the dead' as they are called. Eight days to relearn to walk without shackles. Moscow walks free. Streets [...] words looks at itself as if it were alive Arshinov stays in Moscow. Makhno takes the train back to Gulyai-Polye. He is 28. Ten years of detention had not shaken my faith in the creative force of free labour founded on equality, solidarity. With this conviction I returned home to Gulyai-Polye where i was born, where I had left so many loved ones and where I felt I could be useful amongst a big peasant family. The place where many years ago our first group was formed. Those who knew said: "Nestor arrived!" They told the grandmother. And he arrives, with his jacket, his bag on his shoulder. When he arrives in front of the house, he empties his bag. Nothing but books and newspapers! With those he left prison. All the decrees from Petrograd arrived late. Always late. Then, the change of power created a vacuum. For people it was hard to understand. This appeal to take charge was complicated. I was preoccupied by a theoretic understanding of the immense problem the revolution posed us. I knew this was the case nine out of ten times within the backgrounds that were ours. We were living through an event utterly exceptional. [...] intimately convinced that we needed not only work to raise our own ideal, but above all to not prevent its development with others. For this, we the group of communist anarchists of Gulyai-Polye were alone. According to our ideology anarchist-communist is incompatible. I am talking about our ancient communist ideology, it was incompatible. Anarchists on one side, communists on the other. This symbiosis is all theory. At the start of 1917, in the towns and villages, there was hardly any party representative, no Bolshevik or transit law. A few socialist revolutionary (sr) groups in our towns. This solitude and the determination of a few would be the hallmark of what will develop here for the nine months between February with the disappearance of the old power and October with the establishment of a new power, speaking in the name of the revolution. The spring of history, spring in Ukraine. The first for Nestor Makhno after an endless descent to the bottom of the dungeons. The provisional government from Petrograd with its cortege [...] leaving the hallways is in the middle of here. No-one still remembers the man. combine it in reality within a same sentence, the words revolution or workers, peasants and the old soviet word which means advice. They put together a bunch of documents about everything concerning the land of the region. Who were the proprietors, how many people worked there. It wasn't random at all. They did it very seriously. They discussed it with the people who, in their almost totality, welcomed them with sympathy. We were ten in the family. There was a blacksmith, a tailor, a carpenter... We could do anything. Our family belonged to the Polish family Jawicki. My great-grandmother had bought it against the greyhounds. The other village was free. On the other side of the river no-one could touch us. My brother Sacha was deported, and two brothers-in-law, at Makhno's house. Why were they deported? Because they were with Makhno. Mayday 1917. It has been ten years since I participated in this workers' party and I happily prepare myself. At night I sleep on a table, in the day I run from factory to village meetings. Meetings with teachers, or delegates as we see the campaigners, to inform themselves. Within a few weeks of overflowing activity in the town new elections are organised. Should we control them and how? A union of peasants was created by workers and metallurgists of the Kerner factory, of which Makhno was appointed president. Then discussions that would multiply: what is a cooperative? What is a commune? A union? A delegate? The role of soviet organs of power: An organ of power or a liaison? Should we take the land? What does it mean to take the land? We were told he was an anarchist, understand? Actually, he wanted independence, how to say, for the poor, for the people. He was for the people, that's it. Read here the basics. "Workers of the world, immerse yourselves" and search for the truth, create it." "You will not find it anywhere else." That is the prophecy of the Russian revolution. Interesting! What are you talking about! You can revolt, and then what? There's nothing we can do. They have the army and the police, we have nothing but a trade union. I don't answer to anything. If I would be responsible for anything, if I felt like someone a master of something. But now I'm nothing. What should one do to be someone? A revolution. Long before the big October revolution, he instituted a people's power in Gulyai Polye. It's still important. August 1917 White general Kornilov marches on Petrograd. Premise of the civil war. The morning of August 29. There are meetings in the squares of Gulyai Polye where drivers bring the news of [...] of the revolution. [...] one success of the day was the decision given the urgency to create a committee to defend the revolution and for which Makhno was made responsible. Then without thought the decision to disarm proprietors. The abolition of privileges and to apply the first decree on the land as was discussed here for months in the villages, in the workshops. This was the first time in the Russian empire. History must know this. On his own initiative he gathered all official papers, property deeds of land, of domains, and so on. He burned it all. He cast anathema on the past and started creating something new. Now is the time to realise the secular dream. The people are sovereign over their land and we peasants we have the responsibility to perform such act. The sharing of the reclaimed land was done in autumn because it was urgent to organise [...] and sowing. It was planned to give each family irrelevant of importance one or two pairs of horses, one or two cows and essential tools. Four municipalities were organised around Gulyai Polye and and others further than I know less because I don't have there participated Joint participation was voluntary. Peasants who decided to to become communards grouped by family or affinity. There were some anarchist peasants but the majority was not. There were many discussions on the choice [...] The teaching issue was also debated. The municipalities do did not want to restore the old model. The choice stopped at the libertarian schools of Francisco Ferrer about which we had read reports in brochures. Like a teacher was unaware, we decided to look for the most qualified in the towns and in the first year we brought in people who were the most capable of teaching. The power award goes to the Bolshevik party. Workers of the world, unite. Price: 15 kopeck. Monday night edition 30 October (12 November) 1917. Special issue. Decree on the land. First gala workers' deputy soviet meeting soldiers on October 26 until 2 a.m. First point. Abolition of private land with no financial compensation. This is precisely what Makhno writes. What is the difference? The difference? The methods we used were different. Makhno was against all coercion, against all violence. But then, we have been abused... Who was right? From the new documents we have now, the anarchists were right. I can confirm that during the first two months when Ukrainians gathered around in councils rejoiced in the October coup. They recognised that at the basis was the principle of a real revolution, coming from the depths of the villages and workshops that finally woke up. Everyone remained vigilant when the first commissioners arrived with the first directives, the first inspections. Peasants came to see us. We are obscured, they say. We have to explain ourselves. They arrive, shout, and go. Then they say that the peasants are against the power of the soviet. Creating a free and revolutionary life of the people is a immense question, profound, limitless like the ocean. All power that takes on itself the boldness to create this life by demanding the submission of the people, is locked in an insoluble problem. We the children of this revolution, children of the working people, who created our destiny here, in our villages and our [...]. We develop a solution that is not worn as a humiliation, but as a responsibility. Peasant communes, free unions of city workers prefigure a true working community. We pass commissioners and other exceptional powers we just need to strengthen the awareness of our approach and apply it forcefully to all areas of our life. February German offensive against Soviet Russia. The people's commissioner Leon Trotsky signs a peace treaty with Germany. In return Russia gives up Ukraine. German troops occupy Kiev and in their wake bring back former owners. They form a Ukrainian national government of collaboration. In Gulyai Polye groups are formed to defend the town. Nestor Makhno leaves in search for Bolshevik troops who are still stationed in Ukraine. In April Gulyai Polye is occupied. On a platform of a passing station I learned about the occupation of Gulyai Polye. The flight of revolutionary forces was all around me. Something incomprehensible and lure me squeeze the heart such anguish that I lay there on the platform without thought of leaving. This is the exodus the insurgents of Gulyai Polye became clandestine again, manage to get the message across: see you in three months. Until then everyone tries to understand what appears for all to see, a betrayal of the revolution. I wanted to go return to Moscow and meet the anarchists of the capital and take measures of intentions of a new power. To get here Makhno had wandered from one station to another. It is from one image to another that in this city he will walk. On the one hand that of this power that it is plus six months was peasant worker. He decides to to give up Ukraine on the other the image of the Petrograd prison. Burnt down during the February days during which captives were liberated. It is in this space, window to window we're going to take the measure of the distance between the words of taste the Gulyai Polye. Of those who now here will fight to occupy the pages of a book, like occupying a land at all times. The first window. Visits to revolutionary circles. Second window. Visit to Peter Kropotkin, who writes Makhno warmly welcomes us with tenderness and warmth. Third window. Visit to Peter Arshinov, an old companion. With him we attended every meeting, every discussion, conferences, meeting and I reflected about what I had observed in factories or [...] the thought so prevalent among workers and fascinated and gullible that everything was devoted to creating not their destiny but their power and their dictatorship. A dictatorship that separates me from them because neither me nor my peasants working brothers were proletarians and this word pressed as long as I decided to leave without waiting. But for occupied Ukraine now needed passes and that's how almost by chance i found myself at the Kremlin Fourth window, the most improbable. One that opens the meeting between the libertarian peasant Nestor Ivanovich Makhno and Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, the professional revolutionary. [...] world vision strategy One founded on the model of [...], the other on that of an affirmed approach The staging of the meeting of the Bolshevik and the anarchist did is one of the classics. Even if the version the Makhno character relented on The place: the Kremlin [...] Gulyai Polye The story now of supporters The subject: the negotiation of an alliance The issue: based on impossibility historical and logical and even strategic of such an alliance Everything here is emblematic. Red and black cards on a white background. Four players: the Russian sailor, bearer of the October revolution, of an order determined by laws and history, that is. Nestor Makhno the peasant, bearer of an order that escapes its laws. To the right of the theorist's sailor [...] and responsible anarchy at To the left, the white officer, betraying his class of the homeland In Paris, we had started the debate with the Bolsheviks, They are far from being over. No one has yet proven that Lenin was right. Replace a bourgeois feudal state with a workers 'and peasants' state. Change the masters clothes for blouses, and thus obtain a classless society. Then what? No Gods, no masters? But behind the cliched script there are shots are the costs of what was said almost by chance about the Kremlin or have a voice at Chapter 18 My meeting with Lenin. Lenin welcomed me fatherly and invited me for the evening. He started questioning me as specific as possible about organisation. The question: how the peasants with an island the watchword all the power to the soviets in place there me asked three times. I replied that for the peasants that meant that the power should be aligned with the conscience and will of the peasants themselves. Lenin answered me thus: your peasants are contaminated with anarchy. Is this an evil?, I responded. Lenin then asked me the question of red detachments from their heroic struggle against the occupier and the lack of farmer's support. I'm afraid, comrade Lenin, you are badly informed answered. Your group stays away from roads and don't fight in the countryside. How do you see the villages supporting each other? Lenin started laughing. You anarchists, you write about the future unable to think of the present. I answer that I was an illiterate peasant, that it was difficult for me to discuss a point this important but I tell you say, comrade Lenin in Ukraine, in South Russia, as you Bolsheviks say, we are immersed in the present. It is because of him that we are trying to get closer to the future, or that it's true we think and we think very seriously. We no longer support Moscow. This futile and noisy Moscow where the revolution is slowly dying in [...] power politics. Moscow is lost. I started to hate it. Permitted by hundreds of lawful of the cause those of the parties winners of the party and the others who lost to seek in anarchy a kind of perfection that didn't belong in life. And an overwhelming desire to find myself in Ukraine, with villagers and there, with them, to understand what had not been accomplished. Fighting against what was, dying, or liberating Ukraine. Makhno learns about the death of his two brothers, shot dead by the occupier. He finally receives a detailed account from his companions on how Gulyai Polye was conquered and disarmed in April. "My dear Mr Ivanovich. "All members of the revolutionary committee, workers and peasants are arrested and "are waiting to be executed. "Three hours before the occupation, "the Jewish companion betrayed us and "defected to enemy troops. "All peasants are depressed, "there is great hatred towards the Jews." Chapter 6 The Jewish question Jews, breathe freely. The time of the czars and lords more once you were kicked out from land and peaceful hamlets. You are far away from home, without tenderness and consolation. You are exhausted. Rest and be free, like all other peoples. With these words in 1917 in Hulyai Polye I spoke to the Jews, when the crowd threw down to me: 'You Ivanovich, how do you view do you consider all these Jews with which you jointly sit in the city committee. I never curtailed his words in following events, neither in my activity. In the fight against anti-semitism the Makhnovist movement aims to bring it down tirelessly, outside and inside its ranks. For there will be nearly sixty thousand Jews massacred -exact figures are unknown- during the civil war in Ukraine. It was one of the fiercest and the most troubled.

The first resistance groups are formed, without links to each other, each leading actions on their own territory. In 1918, two detachments gathered here. That of Shchuss, sailor from the Black Sea, who was hardly significant, and that of Nestor Ivanovich Makhno. Shchuss, about whom was said, came from Kronstadt, and returned home a revolutionary. Right at the beginning they were barely twelve. One time they were together, they took to the streets shooting up all over the place and howling like this... The Austrians massed there. Then they pounced them, threw everything at them. Shovels, pitchforks, anything they could find. Even those by the river were killed. On the night of the first partisans' victory the peasants name Makhno 'Batko', the 'father', and place him at the head of the insurgent movement. We said 'Batko' because he defended us. He defended freedom, So we called him 'Batko Makhno'. It was strange and upsetting for me to hear 'Batko Makhno' instead of 'comrade'. Sometimes even 'comrade Batko Makhno'. It was this [...] my name it turns went from peasants to a peasant of children to children and the words Batko Makhno became inseparable.

It used to be: "Workers of the world, "go to the depths of your soul, "for only there you will find the truth." Something along those words. Do these words still make sense to you today?

Preparing for Mayday that year, meant people being lent by the collective farm, a tachanka and horses for the Gulyai Polye parade in Nestor Makhno's words and shoulder read in the books.

Communism we were striving for implies the freedom of the individual, equality, self-determination, initiative, creation and abundance. We formulated our ideal of this third revolution based on taking conscience of the humiliated people. We had the opportunity to throw the basics of a society on principles of anarchy. But what we had in opposite of us we left us neither time nor space. They turned the struggle of ideas into a fight between people. The Makhnovist army is not an anarchist army. The ideal of anarchist life cannot be defended by any army. With regard to the construction and trust and creation, she is absolutely helpless and harmless. But every Makhnovist is a possible anarchist. And when war will be over he will go home. A builder of the future. Thank you all.
