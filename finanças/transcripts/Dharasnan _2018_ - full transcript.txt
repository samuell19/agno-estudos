Hey, are you scared about me? No, no... ...nothing to worry darling... ...nothing to worry. Within five minutes... ...I will solve all your problems. Come to me. (THE SACRED TEARS) Namita! Here I am. What's up? Have you made my tea? - Yes, it's almost done. After my tea, give Ronit's breakfast... ...have you served the milk to Ronit's father? Mam, sir was asking for some ?Luchi? today. Never give it. Can't even digest water... ...asking for ?Luchi?! Huh? Mam, your cellphone was ringing at upstairs since for a long time. You need not to worry about it... ...I heard it Just do what I told. Yes, tell me. I was trying so long time... ...was quiet tensed. - Why? Why not? Yesterday night you came alone... ...along with so much hard cash. Now tell me... ...have you got that land? No Harababu. It's very difficult to get it. That person is very fishy. Realized our needs, he is asking for a huge price. I was thinking... ...to buy a revolver. Why! For what? What to do with revolver? To punish those rouges... ...what else. Huh! After seeing any lady, those scoundrels just start licking. You know Harababu, what happened yesterday night while I was returning? What happened? Oh Ok. Is it! No, no, Tamasha... ...revolver is not required. Rather I will arrange a boy... ...at your house for 24 hours within today or tomorrow. Very efficient guy... ...whatever I will say he will do that. Listen, after all you are my 50% Partner in business Tamasha. Keep faith on me... ...will never loose. The full responsibility of your security is mine. I will send the boy within tomorrow... ...and listen we do not need that land... ...will get some other land for the Petrol Pump. Today, shall I come at noon? No, never! Harababu today is 15th August!... ...have you forgotten? Ronit has no school... and Ronit's father is also going to stay full day at home. Huh, leave... ...Ronit's father. You? What are you doing here? Go... ...go and take rest. What happened? Hello, hello... Tamasha... I'm saying... Today it is not possible... ...bye. Ah! Ok fine. Hey Ronit... ...what are you doing here? I'm going to host the flag, because today is 15th August. Tell me, whose birthday is today? Why it will be a birthday? Today is Independence Day. Huh! Who told you? Who will say! Everyone knows it. Go and ask to my father. Oh! Do you know your father's name? Why won't I know my father's name! My father's name is Santoshil Barui. Hmmm? ...are you sure? Isn't someone else your father? Hey, rascal. What the hell you are talking about. Hey someone catch him... ...catch him, wait. Ronit... ...Ronit. I have told you that don't talk to stupid guys. Don't listen to rubbish talks. Go, host the flag and come to study. Hello Yes No, no, let's leave it for some more time... ...mean another one month. Then you can see that the price will be hiked and you will get handsome brokerage... ...I will also get profit. Ok, ok, fine, looking into it. Give me couple of days. Yes, I will let you know. Huh! Ok Whom you want? Please come outside. Why? Please come, I need to talk with you. I can hear your words very well... ...please let me know from there itself. Who has hosted the Flag? Why? Me. You? I thought that some illiterate servant or little boy had done it. What do you want to mean? Aren't you able to understand anything? Look at the Flag properly for once. What happened? Really Surprising! You are still not able to understand anything! You have hosted the Flag inverted. Shame, shame on you. If you do not have any respect then why you people go to do all this stuff? Don't you even know that... ...the colour of the upper part of our National flag is saffron? Listen... ...come inside and speak, else you will get drenched at outside. Nobody dies after being drenched in rain for one day. It seems that you don't know... ...how many people had sacrificed... ...and took the pain to make our country free - Leave it! You needn't have to get much pain to make me understood all these things. If you are not coming inside then you can leave now. Mam... Mam... What happened? Mam, See what Rony is doing upstairs? He is not at all listening to me... he is getting drenched on the roof. Ronit, how many time did I... Ronit Come here. You will not beat me right? Have I ever beat you? Come Namita Namita, get one towel. Coming Mam. My son, you will get fever if you drench in this way. Please don't get drench in this way. Take it Mam. Give it. Now go to bathroom and have a proper bath. Namita, Please bathe and dress him properly... Ok mam. ...now go my Son? Aunty Yes, come in. Come in. Go and see what Prasanta had messed up yesterday. Scuffled and broken his head totally. Go, he is in the room. Prasantada. - Hmm? Oh, You? Come, come, come and sit. I came just after heard your news in the morning. But got little bit late. Hey! How you got drenched so much? Don't say anything! While I was passing Baruipara, the rain started all on a sudden. Well, one rich family had hosted a flag but was inverted. When informed the housewife, she didn't have any regrets. As if it was a silly matter. Then, I brought it down and hosted it properly. These rich peoples are illiterate and snob. Whatever, leave it. How you got into this? Don't say anything, nowadays all people have lost their humanity. Yesterday, when the rain started, I got inside a shop's shade. Hey, Get out, get out from here? Leave me, please please let me stay for a while? Hey, what happened? What happened? Can't you see it's raining! Having torn and ragged wrapper, dirty smell. So, because of that you will throw him? What's with you? It's my shop. Let me decide. No, no, just being a poor man you? Hey Man, just get lost? Was there no one else? Everyone was present. Pretending to be deaf and mute! Was watching the rain! I also didn't keep quiet. I broke his nose with a single punch. Well done! These days people have become dishonest and spineless. Have forgotten to protest. What's the need? There is no meaning to give the life helplessly for sake of heroism. Aunty, what are you saying? Will no one protest wrong things? That's fatal crime. I don't understand so much. It's not a good time. When everyone is accepting all silently then... ...what is the need to get into any mess? No, Aunty. I can't agree with your words. As no one is protesting therefore I should not also protest... ...this is just a coward's argument. What Prasantada had done, you should be proud for being his mother. Bhumika, leave it. Have the tea and go home. Your clothes are fully wet. Have bath first else you will get sick. Don't think about me. It's just a little injury. Within tomorrow, I will be fit. Where did you go in this early morning? I had some work. Definitely, at Prasanta's house right? Hmmm? It was 100% Prasanta's fault. What do you mean? Let me know who told you? Who else will tell? I was there nearby... ...have witnessed it. That means you witnessed that Prasantada got beaten... ...for protecting one helpless man... ...you had not yet spent a single word! Wow! Have you changed your saree? Let me host the flag then will do. How much time it will take to leave the wet saree? Mom, it will also not take much time to host the flag as well. Mania, mania? mania for the patriotism has been awaked in your daughter. Has she got this mania just today? This came from her Grandfather's time. Why, haven't you seen that your father also used to roam... ...with his granddaughter and tell all these stories? Haven't I seen? Freedom Fighter Ananta Mohan Biswas! He had ruined the whole family just for freedom. Not even gave me a proper education. Somehow though I got a job in the factory... ...that also I have lost. Freedom! Isn't your factory will open again? No way! Promoters are roaming for making Flats. The land is supposed to be sold. Does your daughter have any idea about it? She is just carrying the tradition of Grandfather's patriotism. And got accompanied by another rascal Prasanta. That Vagabond jobless fellow is... ...as like a glowing symbol of truth and honesty! Why did again you drag that guy? Prasanta is very good guy. Yes, I am only bad! That day, I told to her that... ...ask Prasanta to find some job. Oh, is it? What did she say? Do you want to know what she said? She said, it seems that.. ...we are not able to understand Prasanta. He has not born to live luxurious life like others. If born in America... ...he was supposed to be Abraham Lincoln. If born in Africa... ...he is supposed to be Nelson Mandela. If in Cuba... ...supposed to be Fidel Castro. If born in dependent India, he was... ...supposed to be Netaji and? ...would have been Master-da. Ah, how much is her age? She loves Prasanta... ...lives on grandfather's idolism. Now if she finds her grandfather's idolism into Prasanta... ...I don't understand what's the fault in it? No, No, Where is the fault? Father's factory had been closed and earning is zero... ...if she does'nt understand it, then we have lots of sufferings. Vandemataram (Mother, I salute thee)? Vandemataram? Vandemataram? Vandemataram? Vandemataram? Vandemataram? Vandemataram? Vandemataram? Hello. Hello, it's me. What's the matter? You called at such late night? Just thought of you. Tell me, who else is mine except you? At midnight! It seems that your emotions... ...have swelled up! No, believe me I am saying the truth. You know... ...just now I saw a dream. You and I went to Kalighat to offer worship. You wore a ?Garad? saree with red flounce... ...a large vermillion dot at your forehead. You know... ...everyone were looking... ...at us. Tamasha... ...Tamasha, I am pretty willing to... What? Willing... ...willing to... ...eat rice from your hand. Why Harababu? Have your servant left home? No, No, they haven't left. But I am pretty willing to eat at your hand. But I never able to cook the rice properly Harababu. It becomes very soft like mud.. ...or it remains hard and uncooked. Tamasha, whether it's hard or soft does not matter much. As if you have served the rice along with royal items... ...I am sitting on the floor and eating it. In front of me and fanning with a handfan. The back of your blouse got drenched by the wet hair just after the bath. Wow, what an excellent scene! Harababu... ...you are having indigestion. Do not be awake till so late in this age. Go to sleep. If you are kidding with me, that's fine. Either I am dead or alive ? it's because of you. I will go tomorrow noon. Hey Kanai. Yes Sir. Come, Come here. This is Raju. This is for your Madam's security. He will also stay at this house from today onwards. You speak with him. Hello, have you brought all your things? Yes, it's in the bag. Madam was speaking about you yesterday. Come, will show you the room. - Let's go. What's this!... ...why haven't you called up? Was watching... ...mean you were sleeping so have not waked you up. Why have you got up? Please sleep. Else you would have slept. What are you saying? Do I always come to sleep? Tell me, how can I say it? Because various kind of different desires comes in your mind. What a condition of your health you made? Nowadays I really thinks a lot about you Tamasa. Really think about you. Leave me, else Ronit will come. Doesn't he has school today? But how long it will take to get finished! Isn't your jewel fellow husband at home? No, he went to his friend's house today. Oh, then? Ah! Not today. Today nothing will happen. Let's talk about work. You are very cruel Tamasha. Basically whole women race is cruel. Ok Listen... ...I am leaving one boy named Raju. Efficient boy. He will do whatever you will ask, for your security. What about the Petrol Pump? That Land? Tell me something about that. Rascal Ghosal is asking for very high price. Very troublesome. That's why I asked you earlier to pay some advance. Ah, that time the advertisement was not published in the newspaper. It would have been a risk for the Petrol pump. Whatever need to do, we need to do fast. Otherwise we need to look for new land. Absolutely right. Otherwise the pump will get out of hand... ...just because of not having any land in our possession. Will you have some tea? Even ready to have... ...poison from you. Prasanta, do you eat something? No. Now you are rich person boss, how can you relish beggar's rice? What are you saying! Montu, you have a good health... ...then why do you beg instead doing a job? Now see he is imparting knowledge: Begging and begging. Yes, otherwise where is the job? Shall I dig the soil? I can't do that. Begging is better for me. But yes... ...it's my luck that you still come to my house. Hey, don't say all these. What are you saying? Tell me, how many people remembers... ...their childhood friends! Wait, I am coming. It's good that you haven't eaten egg it's not good for you. Wait, let me get the match stick. Hey, what are you watching? It's a stolen cigarette from marriage house. That day I got into a marriage house... ...merely escaped from being punished. How much you earn, Montu? Not bad. I was previously used to beg in the train. Competition raised up. I left begging in the train. But yes, I still travel by train. After couple of stations I get down. Choosing a good locality, I start begging. That's all. Sometime my kidney is damaged... ...sometime daughter's marriage. It's not a matter of 50 paisa or 1 rupee, all 5 and 10 rupees. I gather all the reports, chest x-ray ? everything. Those are duplicate, right? If you get caught then? Caught? No, No, let me tell you one incident. I usually work at Raipore. That day I went to Chandipore, only two stations from here. That was really an ultimate mess up. Is it your X-Ray plate? Yes Sir. Sir, My Kidney has totally damaged. Due to lack of money can't have the treatment Sir. How long is this happening? Sir, almost since 3-4 years, the Kidney has totally damaged Sir. I am not talking about Kidney. Asking, how long are you running this practice of bluffing? Meaning Sir? Meaning? Swine... ...you are teaching Dhoni how to hit an over-boundary? Being a doctor since last 30 years, you trying to fool me? And now you are teaching me to identify the Kidney? Bluffing me by showing an X-ray plate of someone else broken leg? Hey Bullshit? The plates might have swapped between ?Birpara? and ?Chandipara?. I mean Sir? You Rascal... ...still standing here? Pocha?hey Pocha? ...Get me the Stick. After breaking both of your legs, I will hand over the X-Ray plates by myself. Running away? Catch, catch, catch? It was the worst day of my life. All earning was in vain. Don't do all these Montu. One day you will be definitely entrapped. Huh! Today I shall tell you one thing. What? Tell me, you will keep the promise? What? Let's marry. What happened? Great Idea. Your son will be groomsman... ...and my husband will be the head of bridegroom's party. This is not a joke Tamasha. Truly, Truly. I am also seriously telling it. Marriage, once the marriage gets over, I will hand over the garment business along with rice business to my son. Then he will not have any objection about any matter. Will buy a flat at Kolkata. Along with Ronit we three shall stay there. Ronit's study will be better at Kolkata. You need not think about Santoshil. He will stay in this house. He will give the divorce... ...and I will write this house in his name. We shall have our Petrol Pump. Hello Sir have you completed your Noon-walk? If possible please try to walk in the morning, you will be benefited. Nothing will happen by walking in the noon. Hello Sir I have some confidential talk with you. Confidential talk! Yes always like to speak straight forward. Hope you all know about the relation between me and your wife. Now I do not like to dance under the veil anymore. So we decided to get married. Married! Yes. Mean we are not able to live without each other. You will not have any problem. You will sign to the divorce paper... ...will get a huge money... ...and the house will be transferred to your name. Me and Tamasha along with Ronit will go to Kolkata after buying a flat there. Oh, ok. Yes I have already talked with Tamasha. She agreed. Now if you give divorce without any hindrance then the matter can be sorted out though. If you don't give then also you can't detain us. Ok, Fine. What happened? Why are you sitting silently... ...and not eating? What's problem? No, I am eating. I can understand that... ...every day you don't like to have ?Potal?and small fishes. But what to do? It's because of your health condition! Namita? Yes, Madam. Has Ranit slept? Yes, I have feed him and laid down to sleep. He has also slept. Why do you wear such pale clothes all the time? Try some bright colors then... ...you will have some change. Change? Yes, change. If you wear some bright colors... your mind will be fresh... ...and will also feel little bit better. Hmm, ok. What happened? Shame, shame, shame?.See, what they have done to her hand. See, See Dada, what they have done. Dada, as we are poor, aren't we human? Dada, please you do some proper justice for it? Are you fine Didi? My name is Milton, resides at ?Jelepara?. We got some problem... ...so came to Dada. What happened? This little girl works at one of the houses at Banerjee para. There she clean dishes, floor type of works. She had broken one flower vase... ...and for that reason they have brutally beaten her. Pulled and torn her hair, see the condition of her hand. Alas! Seared by the cooking spud. What will you say? Are they human? Can human be so much cruel? Even the people of his locality is suggesting to go to police. Yes, we should do that. No, we should never do that. Police Station, Political leaders all are dirty dove's den. Do you understand that? Huh! They are rich man's servant. If you go there, this little child will never get the justice. Whatever is needed, only we have to do. Right I always want to see this Prasantada, who stand beside others, protests... ...and will get back the right justice. Hmm?Hey Milton? Yes Dada? Let's go to the Banerjee Para. Ok, let's go. You do one thing, you stay here with her. Ok Dada. Bhumika, you stay with them for a while. Let me go, if it is needed I will call them. No, Prasantada. They will go and with them I will go too. Until we give a proper reply to those Banerjee Family members... ...I am not at rest. Therefore we all will go with you. Ok let's go. Let's go dada.

Let him take rest for two days then he will be alright. Hey, your daughter also came. Let's go Doctor. Let's go. Mom, what happened? Don't ask about it. I was so much frightened. Your father became senseless after going to bathroom. Luckily Rashubabu was present at that time. Who is Rashubabu? He was the very person who called the doctor. I called you from his cellphone only. Ok, you tell me what doctor had said? Due to huge gastritis and indigestion the chest pain occurred... ...and he became senseless. Rashubabu brought the medicines. He was telling someone wants to buy our house. Our house? Yes. Was saying there is a good customer. Will give lot of money. What did dad say? Will he sell the house? How will the discussion happen? In the meantime, this mishap happened. He told to Rashubabu that... ...he would be back from bathroom within a minute. When he was not coming for a long time. Then we found this? ...but Rashubabu is a good person. He arranged all thing on a rush. This house! Dad will sell this house? Impossible! Now whom I have appointed is a veil. Already he has provided one news about a land. Owner's situation is not good. Need some money. If they get cash they will give it at much lower rate. Whatever you want to do, do it fast. Aha... ...just close your eyes and have faith in me. Huh! Have you ever been disappointed in keeping faith on me? After the pump will have a flat. Yours and mine. Aha! My longtime dream. Does you at all fit with that skeleton? Is he a deserving husband for a lady like you? You don't know Harababu, I was born with what kind of luck to have a worthy husband! He was the most intelligent boy among our locality. He was Parambrata. My... ...my Param. How are you?... - Good? Our marriage was finalized. Our both family had happily given their permission. I used to go to Param's house. Param also used to come to our house. We were supposed to get united shortly. In the meantime my friend Surabhi's marriage took place. Hey, please come with your husband... - sure. Let me leave for the day. Uncle was supposed to come. Did he come? Don't know. Dad was supposed to come. But not reached yet, how long I will wait? Looking at the sky, it seems to start raining anytime. Let me leave for today. Please don't mind. - No, no, it's ok. Please come to our house? - Sure. Will meet again. Tata, Bye. Issshh! I got drenched fully. Oh My God, Give me one cigarette. Boss, take it. Boss, look at it? Huh!... Where you will go? Leave me? Let's go behind the bushes? Help... help... help. Leave me? What are you doing!... Save me, save?.. What has been gone through me last three days... ...you don't know. I was restless just to see you once. Param, Param, haven't you informed? Yes Then why didn't you came? Such a traumatic incident happened, still you have not come. I was just living on your trust. Param... ...Param, you will never leave me, right? You will never leave me, right? You will be with me, right? Param... ...you will never leave me, right? Our... Our... ...our so longtime relation. Param, tell me? Our love? I have to leave. Are you going out madam? Yes... ...going for shopping. Shall I come with you, Madam? No, If requires I will call you. Please show me some bright colour shirts? As he is a thin and slick person. Ok madam, will show you. Hey, please move this side? Do you like this colour? Why, what's wrong? Colour is fine but there is some confusion with the size... Wait, let me see? I told you right. See this. Then let's finalize all arrangements for the marriage right? Tell me when will we visit your house? Mean, we need to talk with your mother. No, no, you don't need to talk to mom. Means my choice is mom's choice. Great, if so then that's all. So the marriage between Santoshil and Tamasha is final. See, See?.You told that you have seen the bride! No, means somehow bit different! See the condition! Tamasha! Dada, why did you do this? Why did it? He is not that person who came to see me. You, you just cheated me this way! No... ...believe me, I also didn't even know the real matter. I got to know when went to their house. Santoshil is his elder brother. Still that time you would have informed me. At that time? ...and even if I told you what would have changed? It's not that people from few sources came to see you. Whenever they heard raped girl, they broke all relations. Dad passed away in grief and sorrow. Mom's condition is this! Still they agreed for your marriage. The guy is bit thin, that's it. If you take proper care, you can see he will totally change. I have talked with Santashil. Very good guy. At first he has not agreed to marry in this way. Later, agreed for his mother. All mothers have thought. Who came to see you... ...is Dibakar, ...lives abroad. After the death of that old lady, who will look after Santoshil? Tamasha, try to understand a bit. Though one eyed and lame, after all he is a man, right? If he has a wife then someone will be there to look after him. You leave now. You just leave Dada... ...you just leave. Doctor... what else I have to do? You have lot of things to do. A lot. You have inner power, inner spirit. You have to be self-independent. You have to earn money. This will enhance your self-confidence. You will find the meaning of your life. Come. Have you seen those coconuts? There are so many coconuts in those trees. Why don't you start with those? If you sell those in whole sell then you will get lot of money. Gradually start it. Then buy another garden and enhance the business. I will take you those people who does poultry firm business. Do you understand? Now understand the logic and take a poultry firm in lease and start that. Lots of profit. Listen, if you have money you will see lots of problems will disappear. But.. ...it requires lots of money. Why I will give it to you. Am I not providing it? Tell me. You are carrying Santoshil's treatment at home... ...am I not giving the money? What, giving it right? Now I will give you for real venture. In return, what I need... ...that I have already told you, you never agreed. But now get agreed for it Tamasha. Just for the sake of your life. Yes See you have to take care of you and your child's future. Do not choose a half-dead's life by serving for a handicapped person. Live like a human. This life is your Tamasha, your. If your life goes away, nobody will give you another life. Tell me, agreed? Ok, fine. I will not do anything against your wish. I am leaving. Doctor... ...I want to live. The Morning is changing The day is changing Life wants to survive Life wants to survive Whether it needs to repay the debt to you? Secret witness my body knows what's remaining. It's burning vast field, quicksand and only quicksand everywhere. It's a compromise, only compromise with desire to live? If you stretched your hand, I will out of your vision Keep my thirst in those hilly region It's only defeat in return Still becomes alive after death. It's burning vast field, Quicksand and only quicksand everywhere. In return we need more and more Plans are imaginary, Dreams are imaginary Gradually identify the companion of your journey Identify the companion of your journey? In return we need more and more Throat touching thirst Penetrating the celling of life's desire To touch the sky? Plans are imaginary, dreams are imaginary Quicksand and only quicksand everywhere. It's burning vast field, Quicksand and only quicksand everywhere. Now I am alive in this way Sleep is touching the eyes Dreams never come The blind lane is full with embarrassed color The night became silent... ...and silent Dreams never come Life is changing But still it is hypnotic Shaded faces are going away Silence is awaked?Silence Sleep is touching the eyes. Dreams are not coming Quicksand and only quicksand everywhere. It's burning vast field, Quicksand and only quicksand everywhere. Have something to say. What? Are you doing the right thing? I do not think that I am doing anything wrong. As like you I also have desire to live. Insect will destroy the grains of your youth. Insect! If insect will destroy my youth then it will ultimately your loss. Coconut, poultry, that person who just now went down, Bread, butter, spices and half ownership of the business everything will be finished. Everything is in lieu of my youth only. Isn't it? Just think of your past condition and at present how you living. Do you understand that difference? Do you? Then pray for my youth so that it will stay fine. All these nasty things will never be permitted in this house. Even I also can't accept it anymore. I am also looking for separate house. We will also leave this house soon. We means? We means us. Only us. Ask your son Dibakar whom you have shown before my marriage... ...tell him to stay here with you along with his wife. I will leave this house along with my son and my husband. No, Santo will never go. I being his mother is saying that he will never go. He will go. I being his wife is saying this. Ahhh? wife? Despite of you do all your dirty works in front of his eye, still claiming as his wife. Don't you feel shame? No, I don't. You have intended to get him married with me for your own interest. You wanted me to serve your weak son to get cured. That's why, you people had persuade him to me by dirty way and lies. I have done my duty after marriage to get him cured. I gave him the opportunity to become a father. Therefore today my rights on him is much higher than you. He can't live without depending on me. Whatever I will say he will listen. If you can, try to hold your son, hold your son. Son, son... tell me, won't you stay with me? Son, don't be silent. Tell me... Dad, dad. Yes my son, are you playing? Yes, you know dad, Raju uncle has brought me this. Ok. - Mom has bought it. Good one right? Very good, my beloved son, my beloved son. Can you stay apart from me? Why I will be apart? I, you and mom shall stay together. Let, if some day your mother and you go away from me. Do you feel sad? I will feel very sad. I can't stay without you and mom. Dad, will you play ball? Yes, pass it. Take it. Ronit... ...don't you have study? What will happen if you only play? I will keep the ball above the almirah. Go and study. - Go? Don't have network? It has. Are you going anywhere? Why? No, just like that. I wanted to talk with you. With me? Yes. What? Some important talk. Just say what you want to say. I don't have time. No, Harababu was saying. I want to ask is that true? What did he say? He was saying that both of you are going to Kolkata to start a new family. When did he say? Just few days back... that both of you are getting married. If so, do you have any objection in that? Still now nothing has been finalized. But... I am thinking of it. Yes, Hello. Yes, it's Ratul speaking dada. Ah, not to say. Tell me brother, I never able to imagine that you will call. So, what's up? Is there any luck? Yes, of course. Harada, I have got a date from M.P Arjun Roy. Do you know the meaning? Of course, I do. Getting date from M.P Arjun Roy means we are close to the petrol pump. Hello, are you going for noon walk? Have you already found the house? What? Flat or house? I can't understand. No, means it seems that you both are getting married very soon. Tamasha was saying. Did Tamasha told this? What exactly she had told? She was saying that both of you are getting married very soon. That's only. Flat or house? I will, I will. When Tamasa told. Have you eaten something? A strange smell is coming out from your mouth. Medicine. A spoon after having food. Hmm, for what? What is the disease? 'Back spasm'. Ok. Please come. Back... Please come. Why are you late? We need to go out, right? First listen to a grand news, M.P Arjun Roy's appointment is being fixed. Sunday at 2PM. That's why I kept Ratul for it. We are ban on target. Then be happy with that only. There are lot of people like us who used to meet Arjun Roy. Listen, meeting isn't a big deal rather the most important thing is to work done. Hello, everyone doesn't have Ratul. Ratul is Arjun Roy's Right hand. During election he covers a huge area and brings a lot of votes. Therefore Arjun Roy treat Ratul in different way. Now that Ratul is with us. Who can defeat us! Leave all these, ...they have a lot of close people like you and Ratul. Ah, I feel that there would not be any issue. My mind is saying this. But it will not happen just because your mind is saying. And nowadays your mind is also saying lot of bad things, isn't it? Mean? What have you told to Ronit's father? What? What? Don't try to ignore it. Haven't you said that we are getting married and will go and stay at Kolkata? No, That's? Haven't you said? Haven't? No, I have not told it seriously. I just wanted to check that whether he has any objection or not? Mean just casually. Casually? No, it was not casual Harababu. You told it seriously. Even you had also told that I have agreed. Shame, shame, shame, shame Harababu! This is what type of discussion? Haven't you grown enough? Then why this kind of childish thoughts? Just remove all these thoughts from your head. And where is Rashubabu? Who? Rashubabu? agent Rashubabu? Is he coming? No, he will be at Tea stall, we will pick him up. Ok, let's go? Mamoni? Oh, didi, you? How are you? - Fine. Who is that, khuki? Oh, didi you? How is your hand, fine? - Please come, come. Please come and sit inside the room. No, no, no it's ok. Basically that day I was so much busy with my father, I was not able to get any news of here. What news didimoni? I don't send her to work anymore. It is running as usual But that day we all went to Banerjee house, what was the outcome? What should I say Didimoni? Poor men's fate is like that. They have settled down it by providing some money. Money? Settled through money means? Then what about the torture they had made on Mamoni... ...and the scar they had done on her hand... ...and the hair they had torn? Poor men's Justice!! They had given 3000 rupees... ...from that Prasantada said to give 1000 rupees to Milton and friends... ...as they will have some picnic. What? How come Prasantada also accepted this decision? In addition, picnic? This is more severe guilt. Yes, tell me. In this way, you have solved the Banerjee House matter? All those insult, harassment to a girl has been repaid back in just 3000 rupees! Bhumika, try to understand one thing.. See, If you had involved Thana and Police, they would have bypassed it and definitely come out. In spite of that a poor girl got 3000 rupees, what's the wrong thing in it? Yes, just be little bit practical, please. Of course... ...being so much practical you people had taken 1000 from that and had a picnic. Shame Prasantada, I never expected it from you. You should have forced them to beg pardon. Hey, they have already asked sorry Runa herself caught my hand and begged pardon to me. It's ridiculous, why did Runa asked sorry? And that even to you? Banerjee and Banerjee's wife should have begged for pardon to Mamoni. If I was there, I would have done it. Ok, leave it, forget it. Listen, are we meeting in the afternoon? There is a good movie?. ...hello Bhumika. Cut it! Is this the house? Yes, yes. Have you seen, how much open space is there in front of it and it is just beside the main road. So, go and call the House Owner. - Yes. Is your father available? No, he went to the market for a while. Oh, When will he return? Don't know. Has he told anything that when will he return? No, He didn't tell that. Is your mother around? Yes. Can you please inform... Tell that Rashubabu has came. Whom we have seen on the roof... ...who is that lady? She is the only daughter of Pallabbabu. What is the name? ?Radhika or something? Quiet good looking. Marriage, haven't they marry her? You are able to see their condition. The old time has gone. At the same time, Pallabbabu's workshop is locked out for a long time. That's why, you are getting this land in cheap rate. They really need some money. If someone has less money... ...then the temper should be low too. Isn't it? Can't get it properly? You are not supposed to. Leave it. There is no trace of Pallabbabu. Let's go and see the place by ourselves. Sure. If you just roam the whole land, you can easily understand how much it is. Come. Leave it I will not go that side. Rather I am going to sit inside the car. Let me go and see. Ok, let's go. Hey, are you plucking the Lemons? Yes. In childhood, we also had lemon tree in our house. It's like big big... Big pomelos! What's your name? Bhumika. Wow, what a nice name. Do you know him? He is a rich man, named Harababu. Having 4 running business, 2 cars. Yes 2 Cars too. Are you going to buy our house? Yes, it is supposed to be like that. What shall you do after buying the house? Shall you make flats? May make or may not. Why? No, basically... basically Lot of my grandfather's memory is attached with this house. Do you know my grandfather? What's the name? Ananta Mohan Biswas. He was a clerk at Howrah Court. He was a freedom fighter. He fought against the British and made our country independent. Lot of his memory is attached with this house. Yes, of course. It is for me like what should I say, like I am buying some of his property of that great man. I am really obliged for it. What else? I have seen someone's picture at the room with someone at the lap. Is he your grandfather? Yes. Can I request you one thing? Yes, of course. That time, lot of freedom fighters used to come to our house. They used to have meeting secretly. That mango tree is there and the platform beneath that tree, right? Those freedom fighters used to sit there and have those secret meetings. Who are those people used to come? Netaji, Khudiram. Yes, yes, Deshbandhu also used to come. Yes, yes, Deshbandhu came many times. Wow, then he must be a great freedom fighter. Does Freedom fighters are great or ordinary? All Freedom fighters are equal. All have the same fire inside them, same chant in their lip and same dream in their eyes. So I wanted to say that... ...if you can leave this place vacant or make a platform properly then it would be really great. This would not be possible by my own consent. I need to talk to Tamasa. If you are agreed then your wife will be agreed too. Can you please make her understand? She is not my wife. Sorry. Lot of people do the same fault. She is actually my partner... ...means business partner. Hello It means you have not saved my number right? Who is speaking? Basically my phone was giving trouble for a long time. A lot of contacts was deleted. You aren't able to recognize my voice as well, right? How can I recognize the voice through phone? It's Ratul Halder speaking. Oh, oh? Sorry? It's a blunder. Now I can able to understand. Tell me. No, no nothing to be sorry. See, we just met each other for one day. That's even for a little time. I would also do the same mistake if I was in your place. And my voice is not a baritone voice ike Amitabh Bachchan, so that you can identify by only listening. But your voice is quiet impressive. It's not like that only baritone voice can be identified. Yes, you are told a perfect truth. Comedian Kesto Mukherjee's voice was not baritone, but anyone was able to identify. What do you say? You really talk funny. You have good sense of humor as well. Thank you. It would have been pleasure if I can believe your words. Why will I disbelieve? Because common people believes that... ...Political persons are cheat, liar and in some cases clown. Whatever so, Let's come to point, the scheduled meeting between you and Arjunda... ...on sunday at 2 PM that has been cancelled. What? Yes, Now another news is that I have fixed another meeting with you... ...that is on sunday morning. Is it so? Is it so? So kind of you. It appeared like a tit for tat. Haa... haaa... haaa... Why it would be brickbats, it is a flower. I would be curious to see the flower. So when do we need to meet... ...on sunday? It seems that Harada can't be able to return from Durgapore. You do one thing, you come alone at exactly 10AM in the morning. Are you listening? I have something to say to you. Come in. Tell me. Are you really buying our house? Why? We shall not sell that house. I don't want that you would buy that house. Am I supposed to do as per your wish? Your father is the owner of that land. Whatever I need to discuss, I will do it with your father. You may go now. But both I and my mother also stay there. Does our opinion has no value? No, Nothing. You are going to stay in a new house after selling the old house. It would be better for all of you. Do you know that that house was built by my grandfather? My grandfather was a freedom fighter. He fought for the independence of our country. There are lot of memories of my grandfather in that house. We can't leave the possession of the house at any cost. You should think of it before taking advance. Advance? Yes For what? Mean... ...Money? Your father has already taken a lot money as advance from us for this house. Do you know that? How much has he taken? Better you ask that to your father. I am saying it that I will return those money to you. Please listen to me. Please, I do not want to discuss anything about it. You may leave now. Dad, have you taken advance for selling the house? Yes, I do. But what happened? Is it a big deal? Now I am going to market to arrange the bread and butter for all of you... ...doesn't it need money? But aren't you the son of the great freedom fighter Ananta Mohan Biswas? So many memories of your father are attached with this house. But still how can you talk about selling this house? Yes, I of course do that. Memory? Will it provide us the bread and butter? What the great change happened after the Freedom? Everyone is plundering all. Since the workshop had been locked out, I am just sitting idle at home. Does your Freedom fighter grandpa come to see us? Has he come to run the family? When I have to take the responsibility to run the whole family... ...then I would not go to give any explanation to anyone about my deeds. Dad, still I am reminding you that you have time, just return the advance as we are not going to sell this house at any cost. Shut up. Don't try to teach me. Grandpa! Grandpa! Is your grandpa coming to feed you? Arrange your marriage? - Huh, What are you doing? Again you are shouting? Please, I beg you, kindly please do not shout. Do you think that I wish to shout? It's just burn my head. Do your daughter realize that how does the family run? When today there is some opportunity to get some money, suddenly your daughter is overwhelmed with patriotism. Shit of Patriotism! In such a country where people can't feed themselves... ...there what is the meaning of patriotism? I will definitely sale this house. Bhumika! Uff! No, no. No, no. Uncle can't sale that house at any cost. After all a sentiment is attached. That's not only yours. It's our too, It's our too, Bhumika. Such a glorious heritage, that can't be sold just for money? No, no somehow we have to stop it. Prashantada... Please do something. I have forgot everthing and came to you. I thought that perhaps you will never see my face Bhumika. What had you done with that Banerjee's incident.. ...and denied my phone call. Really, I thought that I will never see your face. Today whole day, I have fought a lot with myself. I was not able to understand that what should I do and whom should I go for it? I was totally clueless. Dad had decided to sale the house Prasantada. I am not able to resist him in any means. Prasantada, please rectify your guilt today. You don't know, how much I respect you. It would be really painful to see you to be degraded from that place. It's really painful. Don't worry, It will be definitely get settled. What is her name you told? Barui? Tamasha. Tamasa Barui. Fine, by the way Tomorrow is Sunday right? Tomorrow morning we will go to her place. Arjunda She is Tamasa Barui. That Petrol pump? Ok, ok. It will be done. Let me come back from Delhi. Basically he is bit busy today. Ok. He has a flight at 2PM for Delhi. Ratul, just wait for a while. - yes, You will take that order. -yes. Ok Sir. Let's wait outside. Raju! - Yes, tell me. Did Tamasha leave in the morning? Yes. Exactly where, do you know? It seems that she has some important meeting. Hello Whom do you want? We want to meet Tamasha madam. But she is not at home right now. If you want you can talk with her husband, Santashil Barui. Hello Hello Are you Tamasha madam's husband? Yes. Are you buying Bhumika's house? See, I don't know anything about it. What! You don't know anything! Quiet surprising! Your wife is buying the house and you are saying that you don't know anything? It seems that you are still hiding it. Let me tell you, few days back your wife and someone named Harababu came to see our house. They also gave advance for it. But surprisingly you are saying you don't know anything! Is it possible? You tell me! Believe me, I don't know anything. They were deciding to buy a house but I don't know anything more. Where are you from? Kanthal Bagan, It is near to the main road. Ok That house will never be sold. Can you get it? There was a freedom fighter belongs to that house. For that reason, the house will be not be sold out, just inform to your wife. Freedom fighter? Yes, Freedom fighter Ananta Biswas. Have you heard his name? Yes heard of it. Great, then no issue. That house will not be sold. Ask your wife not to proceed towards that house. Though, she can't take over the house. As myself and my boys will make such a chaos... ...that she will understand own blunder. Then both Money and house both will be lost. Ok. Let's move. It looks like we have to come again. So inform to your wife. If she understands that's good. Else we will come again. But that time we will not be two, we will have 200 people with us. I told you to keep faith on me, right? Yes, I do. When Arjunda has committed then it will be definitely done. Nothing to worry. Thank you. You are most welcome. Believe me, I am feeling such a great... ...after getting in touch with you that I can't express. In fact this has never been happened to me. This is the first time. Is it so? Yes, Yes. Wow, you have nice fingers. Generally beautiful ladies don't have such nice fingers. Then I am not beautiful. Is it so? Did anybody tell this to you? Yes. A lot told. Ok. Then they all were women. Tell me? Huh! You will tell. I was waiting so long for you. Your call is not coming. I got stuck in some work here. Now sitting at a hotel in Durgapur. Have you visited? Yes. Only Yes. Tell me in details please. Basically I was not able to talk much... ...but Ratul mainly talked in details. Yes, Ratul is really a clever guy. I already informed him. So what do you think? Would it be fruitful? How can I predict? It seemed to me he is very busy. He was telling that he would go to Delhi at noon... ...though he assured that it will be done after coming back. Had he noticed you? Had you dressed beautifully? Why will I dressed beautifully, without any reason? Without any reason! You will get extra benefit if women are well dressed. But that is only applicable for the people like you. All men are like me only. Ok, leave it. Bye for now. Tomorrow I am coming back. May I ask you one thing? Yes. One boy and girl came in search of you. When? Just after you left. What did they say? They said that you are going to buy a house. Yes, I do. So? The house belongs to that girl and she will not sell the house. How was the boy? Good, having good physique. You know he was very angry and was telling that... ...the house belongs to one of the freedom fighters. If invest money on it then it will be all in vein... ...and said that they will create huge chaos by bringing more people later. Ok, threatening me! You need not to worry about it. I will manage it. Huh! What happened? Anything else to say? Why are you buying the house? What's your interest? No, I was just asking that is it to stay? No, after marriage, staying so close... ...then it would disturbing for all. Then it would a pressure on Ronit too. Hey, listen. I am not buying for that I have different reason and there is no need to inform you that. Ok. You don't need to know that. Yes Just get dressed? Why? Because you will look more beautiful. Where are you? At home. But it will take only 5 min to reach to home with my winged horse. What else will be better luck for me if the prince will come... ...to take me with his winged horse? I am waiting. Sometimes I wish to get deep inside your eyes You don't know I don't understand too Still I wish a lot. Still I wish a lot. Sometimes I wish to get deep inside your eyes You don't know I don't understand too Still I wish a lot. It's a blow inside my heart Such an attraction of Love I am free I am mad Will get wet into the rain of freedom. Your fresh gush of wind? Just touching my sail with your fresh gush of wind? Break my anchor I do not regret if I sink. Your fresh gush of wind. Dhrim tana na dhrim, Max scoop, Ice cream Song in Coffee Shop Saying to you O Lady, Don't be sad at all.

It's run like winged horse. Will you buy one? I don't know how to ride, Son. You will learn it from Ratul Uncle. He promised me to teach me. Is it so? He loves me very much and gives me chocolate every day. Even he loves mom too. How do you know that? Hey, tell me. You will not tell anyone, right? No, I will not tell anyone. Promise? - Promise. You know dad, One day I saw that Ratul uncle had hugged and was kissing mom. Mom was kissing too. You will not tell anyone, right? No. Where are you going? Have some work. I shall also go with you. You better stay my son else mom will scold. Dad! Are you mad? Will you go to beg? Why shall I be mad? You are my childhood friend. If you can then why not I? Both of our situation is same? I used to do it for my bread and butter. I too have the same need Montu. Don't talk rubbish. You have enough money to die in peace. That does not belong to me, it's my wife's money. Both are the same. No, not the same. Nothing I have done in my life. Is it a life? Failure as a son, failure as a husband, even failure as a father too. Just give me a chance to redeem myself. You will see that I can successfully do the begging. I don't have anything else. Have it. Light juice, you will not have any trouble. This is totally fresh fish. You know when I bought it, it was alive. I would have eaten if it was dead also. Shit! What happened? Why are you standing? Please be seated. For whom are you dressing so much? Don't you know? Everything for you. Huh, for you? So long I used to think like that. But now I realized that some more lucky people are there surrounding me. You know Harababu, own fate and other's character... ...always seem to be bad. When is MP returning back? What is your Ratul is saying? Why Ratul will be mine? Ratul is yours. Will it be a right decision to leave everything on them? They are political person. We should keep some update by ourselves. Have you brought the car? Yes, Why? Come with me. Where? To someone's house. The guy is jobless. I shall offer him a job. Where are you kidding all time? I am not kidding at all. Please come with me, you will understand. Where is job that you will offer? Has Ratul told anything? Uff, how is Ratul coming into it? No, how can I say. May be the guy has requested you and you requested Ratul. Listen, that guy came to my house last night. You don't try to possess that house. Hey, don't speak with anger. 100 times I will do. I must. Don't you feel shame? You are going to destroy the house and memory of a freedom fighter... ...just cost of money. Oh! So you have taken the sacred responsibility to protect that memory. What's your interest? What's the relation between you and that girl? That's none of your business. Just want to convey this that if you at all try to... ...occupy that house then there will be bloodshed. Why will you take the initiative to go to him? Doesn't he get indulged? Call and let him come. Hmm Not a bad idea. I am takeing this suggestion from you Harababu. I never suggest wrong Tamasha. Tamasha, you are already well dressed so let's go somewhere nearby. Are you mad? Why? Let's go please. So Tamasha, you have not forgotten me, right? See Harababu. None of you and I have the age to play childish. Leave my hand. No I will not. Please leave. Harababu what are you doing? Please leave, leave it. Harababu, Did I hurt you? Sorry... Please get up. What a childish thing you always do. This place has been swelled up. Do you need some rest? No, I am fine. I can understand Tamasha... ...but can't resist my mind. Do you both frequently visit that place? Where? In that hotel where you and Ratul went yesterday night. Me? Yes, You. You and Ratul just left on bike in front my eyes. No, Harababu. You observed wrong. I had not even met Ratul yesterday. It seems that you had noticed someone else Harababu. Someone else? What else? Harababu, it seems that you are getting old and not able to see properly. Instead of me you saw someone else. Oh. Harababu, do you have some tea? No, thank you. Let me leave. Prasantababu... Prasantababu... Prasantababu... What happened? Madam means Mrs. Tamasa Barui has asked you to come once. Tamasa Barui? Why? She has told you to meet once tomorrow morning. Has Tamasa Barui asked me to meet? Why did she want to meet me? Perhaps both of us need it. But your need is more than me. Tell me, what do you want to say? You have to ignore that house. Absurd Impossible. If you try thousand times then also you can't. Because I committed to Bhumika. But if you have to do it for Bhumika? Mean? It's because you love Bhumika. You will also marry her in future. But see, you don't have any earning... ...and in simple words you are totally unemployed. Ok, you tell me why shall Bhumika's parent give their daughter... ...to someone who is jobless? Ok, leave it. Let them decide it. No, no Prasanta... you also need to think about it. See Prasanta, they will get a lot of money after selling the house. Then they will find some proper match. What will you do then? Do you roam like Devdas in love? Aha! What are you doing! I have different kind of mutual understanding with Bhumika you leave it. You will not understand that. I don't want to understand. Prasanta, I don't. It is enough if you understand. But you know Prasanta... Life never runs on understanding. The world is a very tough place. To run it money is needed and I shall arrange that money for you. You will see that your life will change overnight. But yes, that's not a bribe. That's a settlement for your betterment. You can not run your life on the basis of the commission... ...by rowdy-ism or hooliganism. Will you not think about your future, tell me? You have to also take her's responsibility right? Suppose, you would get a good job and salary is also quiet good. Then how will you feel Prasanta? What? Job? What kind of job? In a Petrol pump. The Job of a manager. Manager? What's the salary? What do you think? How much it should be? Minimum 10 thousands. Wrong. 15 Thousands. Agreed? 15 thousand? Yes, 15 Thousands and we are going to make the petrol pump... ...in place of that house Prasanta. And you will be the manager of that petrol pump. Just take this one month advance. 15 thousand rupees. What are thinking? Just keep in your pocket. So Prasanta... ...can we relax now? Yes, 100%. You can just stay cool. You make the pump. Nobody will obstruct you. I am with you. What are you doing? No, nothing much. Wow, what are those things? Those are my various reports. Ok, take sit. Have to say something. No, no, you sit. Hey, please sit. What I was saying, I have a complaint against you. Complaint? - Yes. About what? Keep close watch to your wife's activities. After all you are her husband. Why shall you just leave your rights? Just for example, if the house wife used to roam with someone else... ...then won't it create bad reputation in the society? Yes, I also used to chat with Tamasha. Discussion about the business. Will anybody can claim that they have seen us in any hotel? Where will you get a hotel here? Go to the high road, you can see a series of hotels. But all those are for enjoyment. Ok, doesn't that guy Ratul come daily? Not daily exactly. Sometimes comes. Now you are doing ignorance. It's hard to understand whether you are straight or complex person. No, no. I have no complex. That day I have simply told couple of words with straight heart, but you understood me wrongly. When? When! It was that day, That day, I told you both of us are getting married? Yes. I was kidding. Just a fun. Why shall I go to marry your wife without any means? I think that day you took it serious and told to Tamasha. Now, Tamasha have scolded me. You please forgive me Santoshilbabu. Who am I to forgive you? Ok, Can you tell me why are you so much simple. This is not at all useful to be such a good person. Try to control your wife and also keep watching Ratul. Madam is calling you. Hey you go. There is a great news, I got a job. Really? Of course. Owner herself has given a job. You know, she has also given me one month salary in advance. 15000 rupees! 15000 rupees? What are you saying Prasantada? Yes. Now tell me I am quite capable in regards to present market right? Have you heard that someone called and offered job to someone? And it is not any small post job, rather Managerial job. Managerial job? Yes. Then nowadays I need to call you as Mr. Manager. Isn't so? Prasantada, which company? It's not a company. Petrol pump. Listen, apart from my monthly salary my owner has promised to give me... ...extra commission on those sales where receipt will not be provided. So who is that kind owner? It's Tamasha Barui. Tamasha Barui! That lady? So why is she opening a petrol pump all on a sudden? No, it's not suddenly. She had a plan that we didn't know. What didn't we know? I mean, she is buying your house. Afterwards she will open a petrol pump in that place. Prasantada? Believe me Bhumika, I had no other option. See, I am getting old but having not a single job. See Bhumika... ...we also need think about our future, right? Bhumika, at the same time my mother is not well. You know well about the current scenario to get a job. See, we both are getting old. Bhumika, Bhumika just leave all those old sentiments. Bhumika, Try to be little bit practical. You see, if the house gets sold out then you all will also get a lot of money. You people can stay well. Tell me, isn't will that be good? See, I will get a job Bhumika. Bhumika, why are you silent? I love you Bhumika believe me I really love you. Believe me... Traitor! You, you are exactly right Grandpa. He is a traitor. I have no relation with him. No relation, no relation. Hey, what? Why are sitting in dark? Are you feeling well? Yes, fine. Listen Will you go tomorrow to see the house? Small but the southern side is open. Rent is also low. If you agree, I shall finalize the deal. Will you go? No. My son, don't be so rigid. You have grown up now, please try to understand. Ok, tell me except you who else do we have? What I am thinking you know... after getting the money I shall start a business for Prasanta. Then we will give your marriage. Prasantada has already got a job Dad. Got it? Where? In a Petrol pump. Those people who are buying our house will make a petrol pump here. Ok. And Prasantada will be the manager of that petrol pump. Wow, That great. Then you should have fun, instead you are sitting in a dark face. I heard that whole day you have not eaten any food. Tell me, what happened my son? Dad, my eyes are getting irritated for the light. Can you please put out the light? It's quiet surprising! Whenever I am calling Ratul, his phone is coming engaged. You are trying to contact Ratul, right? You can't reach him. You will never be able to contact him. You will feel bad if you listen the reason. Though it's bad, you tell me. So you came. Hope you got the news. If you had decided to own the Pump under your name... ...then why you harassed us by giving false impression so long. See Harada, I am a political person. I can change anytime. At the same time, I also need to see my own interest, right? But you should haven't cheated Tamasha. You too can just make fun Harada. Are you saying it cheating? It seems like your Tamasha is so much innocent? She is a spoilt women. I know everything. Tell me, how many people have been spoilt around her? You are also one of them. Everyone is enjoying when its my time you called it cheating? Just imagine, what a figure in this age! Hard to believe! Who will say that she has a son? Some one like her will come to me by own self and I will leave her, Is it possible? If you were in my place, could you leave her? Disgusting, i don't believe that Ratul will do like this... Save?Save? Come?.Come to me?. Where had you kept those plates? Inside the Bag. If your wife gets to know about it, I will be finished. Listen, What I taught. Just do exactly the same. Yes.
