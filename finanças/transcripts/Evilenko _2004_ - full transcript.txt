Once upon a time, there was a little girl, just like you, with hair just like yours and eyes just like yours, and she followed a cloud and learned how to fly. And after a while, since no one had seen her, well, every one thought that the girl was dead. So they had a funeral. And the girl watched her own funeral from way, way up there... in the sky and she saw that no one was crying. And then she knew her mommy and daddy didn't really love her. So she stayed up in the sky and never came down again. Is that the end? Yes. EVILENKO We are the pioneers of the Soviet Union, there are millions and millions of us. Do you see our flags? In the wind they carry the wonderful ideals of comrade Lenin. Yes? Sir? Can I have my ball back? This ball? You mean to tell me that this is your ball, Sasha? Yes. My mommy gave it to me for my birthday! Your mommy? Your birthday? Your ball? Well, you're lucky you even have a mother. Most of your comrades here are not quite so fortunate. We are all equal in here. Nothing can be yours in this institute, or his, or mine. Your mother was very wrong to buy you presents. I'll have to have a... word with her when I see her. You may sit down now. Not you. It's your turn to clean up today. Whore. Whore. Whore! Why are you crying, Tonja? Whores don't cry. Stop whimpering come on. No more tears. Come, please, come here, come. Oh, oh Tonja. You're the only one. The only one who really knows. The others are afraid of me, but not you. Because you know how much I care for you, don't you? What were you showing to your friend Kolya during class? Nothing. Oh no, no, no. I saw you. Eh, you know I saw you, you even blushed, yeah. Just like you're blushing now. Secrets cost money, it's only fair. It's all yours you take it, alright? Show me. Let me see if it's worth the money. It's the first time you've seen a real man. Scared, huh? You like it too, don't you, be honest. You can touch him if you want. Here, give me your hand. Oh no? No. He wants to be your friend. He told me that he likes you and he's dying to show you... what happens to him when you touch him. He gets big, and if you treat him right you're honest with him, he can do anything... there is nothing he can't do. What, even fly? Yeah, even fly... and if you're very brave... he'll let you fly with him. Does that mean me he can talk too? Oh no, no, no, no he doesn't talk to anyone. He, he doesn't trust anyone. Not even me? No, no, no, not you, of course. Alright then, make him talk. Wait, wait a moment. st... give him a chance to get big. No, you're lying! He can't talk. He can't, because he's dead. No, No, no, you. I'm sorry about this, Andrej Romanovich. But little Tonja here claims that you... well, basically that you tried to rape her? You see, comrade... I'm very fond of Tonja but for some strange reason... she seems to have nothing but sex on her mind. The fact that she's accused me of raping her would seem... to prove my point, wouldn't you agree, comrade? What's wrong with you, Tonja? How could you make up such a horrible story? Do you think it's clever? I didn't make up anything! I told the truth! And if you don't believe me, look at his arm! I stabbed him! Look at his arm! The other teachers have been inciting her against me, you can be sure of that. A conspiracy, you mean? Oh, you took the words right out of my mouth. We're on the verge of chaos, it's up to us good communists to do something about it... before it's too late. Show me your arm, comrade Evilenko. I'll pretend I didn't hear that, comrade. And I'll pretend I didn't hear this story. I expect your resignation within the hour, comrade Evilenko. Come on, Andrej! Hurry up you'll be late for school! I won't be going to the school anymore, Fenja. Oh, no, no, no. I'll, I'll tell you later this evening... when you get home from work. No, no, go on, Papocka. Tell me now. I made a discovery, a terrible discovery. The headmaster is part of the conspiracy. What? Surinov? Yes, Surinov. Up to his neck in it. The other day one of the boys asked the geography teacher... what communism was... and this is what Tablinova answered to him. She said: "communism is a model society in which all men... are supposed to be equal but it's a utopian ideal", in other words, "an impossible dream". Ah, can you believe that? Oh, Andrej, what are you going to do about it? I went straight in to Surinov and I told him... if he tolerated anticommunist doctrine in the classroom, I had no alternative but to hand in my resignation. Good Andrej. And what did he say? Well, the bastard accepted it. What? No, that's impossible! Andrej, you must go and speak to the Party straight away! I will, Fenja, yes I will. But, but it's... I've got to be careful. Very careful. No. Andrej, listen to me, you can't give up now. You must go straight away to the Party... and tell them how serious this is. I know. Why don't you write them a letter? Oh, you're so good at that. Go now. You don't want to be late. Have you been waiting long? I was late for the bus. - What's your name? - Larissa. I bet you're eleven years old, Larissa. Yes. I expect you're wondering how I knew that? Yes. Well, that's easy. I teach little girls like you. I'm a school teacher, you see? Oh. Let me guess. You got a bad grade today. How do you know? Well, a good teacher knows everything. I don't expect your mother would be very proud of you... to go home late with a bad grade. Larissa... Don't cry, don't cry. I tell you what... hey, why don't I take you home? My car's parked over there behind those trees. Come on. In order to continue the process of the perestroika, in order to advance and speed up the reforms, in order to protect democracy, in order to efficiently promote... I'm going out Fenja. I can't stand this disgusting scene. - I'll be back soon. - Alright dear. Are you Evilenko Andrej Romanovich? Yes. I've come straight from Moscow. From Moscow? I'm here to give these back to you. My letters? What do they think of my letters it in Moscow? Nowadays, there are not many people who think as you do. I'm a communist and I will die a communist, I have already lost my job at the school... because of my ideals. There is a desk waiting for you. Officially it's a very ordinary job... but you will be working for us. Who exactly are you? I am General Tabakov. KGB? Right now we need comrades we can trust. And I feel that we can trust you. The head of the department is a man called Bagdasarov, he used to work for us, but now he's gone over... to the Gorbachev side. We need to prove that he steals. Do you think you can do it? I'll do my best. Good. If there any problems... do not hesitate to call me. - What's your name? - Pavel Aleksandrovic. I bet you've skipped off school today, didn't you Pavel Aleksandrovic? I got special permission. If you got special permission why have you... got your schoolbooks with you? Oh relax, Pavel. You needn't be afraid of me. I'm not going to tell on you. I'm just wondering though, what you're going to do... when the conductor comes by. That's not gonna do you much good. Don't you know that he's got a list of all the boys... missing from the school? Sit down, it's alright. Do you want to get off the train? The next station is in half an hour. There's an answer for everything. I tell you what... you go to the toilet and wait. Lock the door. As soon as the conductor has come through the carriage, I'll come and give you the "all clear". And I'll knock... three times. My little monster, huh! Princess. Yes. Who's that? That's mama. Oleg! "The wood strip" You ever heard of it? The man who kills children? Yes? Not just children. Women too. As long as they're young enough of course. How many has he killed? How many have you heard? Three or four, I think. Well, it used to be one every three months. But now he's getting away with it. - The murders are increasing. - So how many? Twenty-two. What's worse we don't have a single lead, no witnesses, no clues, nothing. He's constantly on the move, striking everywhere. The other day I was in Leningrad. He murdered a little girl there. Are you so sure it's always the same person? You should see what he does to those kids. Killing is too kind a word. First he rapes them, then slices them to pieces, and eats them. - Eats them? - Yes. - Why me? - For many good reasons. Give me one, anyone. Hello sweetheart. Because you're a Party member. There are lots of investigators who are Party members. Not anymore, unfortunately. Besides, you're by far the best. Give me another one. I'll give you one which might seem a little strange to you. And what's that? Your family. What's my family got to do with it? You haven't told me the name of your daughter. Mariam. It's little girls like Mariam who are in danger right now, my dear Vadim Timurovich. Shall we play? Yes? Natalia. Well, Evilenko. How this reports coming along? All that traveling around, all those inspections... and you still haven't produced a single sentence. What do you do in your free time... Evilenko? A little bit of murdering on the side, perhaps? I helped a friend earlier this morning, we slaughtered a pig. Well, anyway, next time don't be so selfish. Bring us a few sausages. That's my daughter! That's my daughter! Let go of me! Let go of me! Irina! Irina! Irina! Irina! Irina! - Traces of sperm? - I don't know. I should take that branch out first. Well take it out then. What are you waiting for? I've already tried. Couldn't do it. Well, get some help then. I thought maybe we could take her away like this. Are you joking, doctor? Her mother is here... she's over there behind those trees. Do you want her to see her daughter pierced... like a hunting trophy? Ah, you're right. Well, the sperm test isn't so important. Who knows how many we'll find of the same group. The killer's sperm is our only lead right now, Dr. Amitrin. So remove the branch before it gets dark. What's her name? Irina Radinova. Only twelve years old. Looked older, didn't she? Get someone to help Amitrin with that branch. And tell him to hurry up. Yes, sir! Nikitin! Give Boris a hand! Has he confessed? Not yet. But his kalashnikov was found near the victim. He looks very young. How old is he? Twenty-one. Name? Nosov. Vladimir Nosov. - A conscript? - No, a full-time soldier. - How long? - Three years. Mama. Mama. Mama. I know you didn't kill that boy. So you've nothing to worry about. Mama. Hey! Mama. Mama. I know that you were there... so you must have seen something, uh? Am I right? Did you see the killer? Quiet! How about this? I'll bring in the killer and I'll show him to you... and if you recognize him, all you have to do is point him out. If you agree, give me a sign. Close your eyes. Good. Frolov, Ramenski. Go! Alright. Every one get in line. Get the benches. They can't see you. Is he there? Do you recognize him? That's him? Hey, come on, pal. I'm going to need one a lot bigger than this. It's too big, if your brain's anything to go by. That'll do it. Take a look at these photos. Have a look at these pictures. Name, surname and father's name. Aron Richter. My father's name was Abraham. - Jewish? - Yes. - Occupation? - I'm a doctor. It says here you have a soft spot for children... Yes, yes I like children a lot. I'd love to have had some. You need a wife for that, Dr. Richter. So I'm told. But you can't have a wife or children because you're a homosexual, is that correct? I know lots of homosexuals with wives and children. In 1975 you were arrested and convicted for molesting a boy... in a cinema, ring any bells? You'll have a hard time finding him. We know. It takes a very unusual type of man to do a thing like this. Oh, on the contrary. It could be anyone. Me. You. Him. Anyone. We're talking about pedophilia and cannibalism. Man is a ferocious animal, didn't you know that? And you really think anyone could be capable of this? If one man is capable of it, any man is. - Why? - Why? Do you want to know why? Well, it's simple. We used to be a flock of sheep and now we're a pack of wolves. Are you a surgeon, Dr. Richter? Theoretically speaking yes, but I've never... actually operated on anyone. This man is a lot more skilled than I am. - What's your field? - Psychoanalysis. - You're a psychiatrist? - No, a psychoanalyst. What's the difference? Psychiatrists generally put their patients into asylums. I don't. - And where do you put them? - Nowhere. They come to me, at home. And how do treat them, at home? They talk. I listen. Thank you. Over there and then you can go. I was at home with my wife. No one else? No one else. Take a look at these photographs. Do you find them amusing? Not at all... I broke my glasses. You see, comrade... Don't call me comrade. Why don't you want me to call you comrade? Occupation? I asked you why you didn't want me to call you comrade! I'm asking the questions here. Don't you realize without communism, you wouldn't even exist? I asked you for your occupation. I'm a Party member. I demand to speak to your superior. The Party doesn't mean anything in here. Don't make things worse for yourself, lad. Just let me speak to your superior. Is something wrong? I didn't realize it's become a crime to be a communist. It hasn't. I happen to be a communist too. So shall we continue the questioning now, comrade? - That's why I'm here. - Occupation? I used to teach literature at Boarding School No. 32 in Kiev, now I work for the railways. And what do you do at the railways? Eh, inspect the network, report malfunctions, count the sleepers. So you've gone from teaching literature to counting sleepers. That's a strange career move, wouldn't you say? It wasn't my fault. They forced me to leave the school. Who did? The perestrojka crowd. What's perestrojka got to do with it? There's a war going on. And it's time for you to make the decision which side you're on. It says here that your father, Roman Evilenko, died in hard labor. Yes. My father was an Enemy of the People. He deserved what he got and I'm glad I never met him. Then you should be informed that the so-called... Enemies of the People have been rehabilitated. They now call them "victims of Stalinism". Yeah! Two years ago a woman by the name of Irina Zubova... accused you of attempted rape. Irina Zubova was a prostitute. Does it say that in your little book too? No, I'm afraid it doesn't. No! Of course not. The whores and the thieves have taken all the power now. You can go now. But first step behind that screen over there for a sperm sample. Oh, aha. I'm afraid I can't do that. What do you mean you can't? Well, wouldn't be any point in it. Nothing will happen. Would you mind explaining? It doesn't work. Aren't you married? I fail to see the connection. And what about that woman you tried to rape? That's what she says. She's a liar! Of course, if a whore's word is worth more than mine. We'll so on find out what your word is worth, comrade. I'm detaining you. Good evening, Mrs. Evilenko. Vadim Lesiev of the Attorney General's office. - Can we talk upstairs? - We can talk here. I have some delicate questions. I think it best if we go upstairs. Why have you arrested my husband? Your husband is suspected of murder. Do you mean Andrej's killed someone? Who? There have been many murders. Oh, really? How many? The number is unimportant. Oh, I think the number is very important. How many murders haven't you been able to solve? I'm afraid I have to ask you some questions... about your sexual relationship. We don't care about sex. We think this sex everywhere you see is just disgusting. I see. But you are married. And I take it you have sexual relations. No. You don't have sexual relations? No. Since when? We don't care about sex. I've already told you that. You've never wanted children? Andrej had lots of children when he was teaching at the institute. And they all loved him. Children of your own. Children of our own? What does that mean? If you're a communist, children belong to every one... and every one has to take responsibility for them. They didn't ask to be born into this world. Do you mind telling me why you got married? Because Andrej and I have always loved each other. What are you doing? Who is he? Your superior's superior. Just let him know that I'm here. Good morning. Good morning. Do we have the results back yet? Yes, but most of the suspects have the same sperm group... as the murderer's. Twenty-three of them out of thirty. That only eliminates seven. Frolov, we must release the four detainees. Three. One of them is already out. - Who? - Evilenko. He was collected by two KGB men yesterday afternoon. So Evilenko has dealings with the KGB? I tried asking them but those guys never answer. Do you remember me? Unfortunately I do. And what about the man I'm looking for? Do you think he's interesting? Yeah, yes he must be very interesting. Yes, it's a pity he's not my patient. Do you think the man's insane? Do you mind telling me how many he's killed? Twenty-nine. Twenty-nine? Over how long a period? - Five years. - Five years. So how do you hope to find him? Who knows? Maybe with your help. Me, help the police? I'm not a policeman, doctor Richter. I'm a Magistrate. Well, if there are no more questions. As you wish, if I am a cop then I'm telling you to sit down. P lease, you have to help me and you will. Is that the way you want it? I'll repeat the question. Do you think the man's insane? The answer is yes. He's mentally ill. What makes you so sure? You have to be mentally ill to kill... for the simple pleasure of killing. Does this illness have a name? - Schizophrenia. - Is it? Schizophrenia always stems from an identity crisis. The only identity for the soviet man is communism. Communism is dying, the soviet man, in order... not to die turns to the survival instinct. Man eats man, like at the beginnings of time. So you're saying that we're all sick. Since you used all the insane asylums to shut the mouths... of dissidents and I mean our healthiest minds, well... I presume the real insane must still be out there, wouldn't you say? Do you think he's on his own? Yeah. And very lonely. You might even say he is an exceptional being. You sound fascinated. Of course I am. Aren't you? I just want to catch him. And... what will you do with him? Me? Nothing. The court will decide. They'll sentence him to death? Yes, I hope so. You don't understand and so you kill him. And you'll kill all the others who come after him. What others? Oh, there'll be others, you'll see. There are millions of annihilated men out there, sick men ready to become crazy. So, you and I, shall we work together? No. You want this man just as much as I do. - Yeah, but I want him alive. - Why do you want him alive? I've already told you. This country is on the verge of a major epidemic. He's the virus. You kill him you'll never find the antidote. Hello. He's here. It's for you. Yes. Yes. - Incredible. - What? Look. There isn't a single tear, not even a button missing. Nothing. It's as if she stripped of her own free will. I see you've already started to work, Doctor. I haven't started a damn thing. In order to work, I should get all the information I need. - Alright. - Alright what? I'll give you access to the information that you need. Comrade Bagdasarov, I just wanted to tell you... that I firmly believe in your innocence. You see, Andrej Romanovich. I know perfectly well that it was you who reported me. And, and don't get me wrong. I'm not blaming you. You only did what you had to do. Yes, comrade Bagdasarov! It's just that, if you could put in a good word for me, I'm quite sure it would make a difference. But of course, I'll see what I can do. I don't know how to thank you. Think nothing of it. Thank you, thank you, thank you. - What did he say to you? - Nothing. He just tried to bribe me to keep my mouth shut. Thank you. Did you bring a rubber? If you wanna do it without a rubber, it'll cost more. I'm a vegetarian, Miss Zubova. I don't want to do anything. I just want to talk. How do you know my name? What are you? A cop or a fag? Both, miss. Both. No, you're not a cop. You're too polite. And you don't look queer either. I can assure you. How did you report him? You didn't even know his name. You know how long I spent looking for him? I met him in front of the station. And then it's like I fainted or something. I think he hypnotized me. He must have because suddenly I was here on my bed and... he was standing in front of me, with a razor in his hand. So I started screaming and luckily the neighbors heard me. And he ran off. Do you believe he hypnotized me? What will you do when she goes away? What do you mean? She's a child. Yes, but she'll grow up. She'll leave home, get married, and have children... and what will you do then? I'll console myself with you. Hey! The champagne's arrived! - Excellent! - So... I want to drink... to our children. May God... if he exists, watch over them and protect their young, fragile lives. Hello, Doctor Richter. What are you doing here? I've been looking for you for days. Well, I don't have anything and I... I don't think I ever will. Perhaps you're not looking in the right places. The right places don't exist. You see, I don't think we'll ever find him. Why not? Because I'm not certain that it's just one man. That's the only certainty we have. - Well, it's unfounded. - What makes you say that? Too many victims, too many murders, there has to be more than one killer. We've always talked about one man alone, I remember you describing him as an exceptional being. And do you remember I said that we might be... on the verge of a major epidemic? There is nothing you can do about it... he could be anyone. Yes... yes you're probably right. It could be anyone, maybe even a lonely old man... who comes to the cinema to eye up the kids and wank in the dark. Hello. What's the matter with you? Andrej! Andrej! Andrej. Andrej! At last! I've been looking for you my whole life. I know the fear that is inside you because... Because, uh... I am your father... Andrej. Come... come on. Come into your father's arms. Come on, son. I know how much you've missed me, but I'm here now. Come here, I beg you. Come... Your father... Your father is proud of you, son. We haven't had a chat for such a long time. I know, I know, I know it's my fault. I know how much you've missed me. Yeah, I know what you've been through. I'm back now and I'll never leave you again. Promise. Never, Andrej. I'm, I'm so... I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sorry. A child... I saw a child die in front of my eyes. Oh, she died... It wasn't my fault... wasn't my fault. She died... it wasn't my fault. That's him alright. We've been hunting the killer for years and he managed to... track him down in a few weeks. Mariam. No. No! Mariam. Oh my God. Mariam, are you alright? Are you crazy? What was that all about? Can't you see the blood? She's got a nose bleed. She's had them before. We must take her to the doctor... I've already been to the doctor. What's the matter with you? Why are you behaving like this? I can't believe it... that it's you who's hunting down that monster. What do you know about it? The child killer who eats his victims? Every one knows about him. Times have changed, Comrade Lesiev. You can't hide everything from people anymore! Darling, I agree with you and that's why I'm doing... everything I can to make people aware of it. Oh, yeah? Every one except your own wife? I'm telling you now, aren't I? And you know I shouldn't. I'm only doing it to put your mind at rest. Put my mind at rest? Have you any idea of the risks you're exposing us to? What risks? You don't think he knows who's after him? How should I know? I don't know him. I haven't the faintest idea of who he is. And has it never occurred to you that he might know you? No, it never crossed my mind. That's a lie, Vadim Timurovich. If that were true, why did you scream like that? Because that's when I realized... When I saw Mariam's blood. You have to believe me. I believe you. I always believe you, don't I? What's happening? Rulana? Where are you going? What's going on? I understand now. Understand what? Why are you leaving? I need you. Yes, that's why I'm leaving. You are leaving because I need you? No, I'm leaving because you've got to catch that man. You have to and you will, my love. Want a go, miss? Here. Oh, shit. What do you want? Leave me alone. Look, I don't want money. I know you like me. You're just a bit nervous. Go away, please. Just go away. It's ok, I'm going to make you feel really good. No. Don't move! Papers! How many men do you have guarding these barracks? Twenty but we have four six hour shifts. So we're talking about eighty men? Correct. Do you think it's possible no-one saw or heard anything? It seems pretty unlikely. Would you allow me to question your men? I don't see why not. I found this. - What date is on it? - First of May. Have you been able to time the death yet? Difficult to say off-hand. Three days, maybe four. How long will you need to find out? Three days, maybe four. Do you think it's funny, Dr. Amitrin? No. I'm sorry. It's just... I can't take it anymore. I want the results of that autopsy on my desk... by 8: 30 tomorrow morning. Attention! On the first of May, a woman was murdered here... On your territory. I therefore consider you all equally responsible. I'm going to give you one chance to avoid a trial. And that's to remember if you saw anything suspicious that day. Private Romanenko Andrej Aleksandrovich! I'm listening. I might have seen a man coming out of Wood Strip No. 37... at around 19:00 hours on the first of May and I also think... I might have stopped him. What do you mean you think you might have stopped him? Correction, sir. I know I stopped him. Then why did you say you might have stopped him? Why? I don't know. I can't remember. But I've got it written down here. First of May, 1990. 19:07 hours. A man with blood on his face. Is this the man's name? I think so. And you can't remember seeing him? Congratulations, Vadim Timurovich. I knew you could do it. I think we should arrest him tomorrow morning... when he leaves the house. - No, we should wait. - Wait for what? I want to catch him with his pants down. You want another murder? Thirty-six or thirty-seven won't make much difference. We can't run the risk of losing him just because... we're in a hurry to win. We can't play with people's lives like that. Say you arrest him, what then? What have we got? A note written by some soldier who can't even remember seeing him. We've got more than that. We're still gathering evidence. We've looked into the movements of Evilenko... over the past years and they coincide with murders... committed outside Kiev. So what? What does that prove? They're just coincidences, suppositions, that's all. They won't get you very far. I think I have enough evidence to get... a confession out of him. Why should he confess? - Because he's a sick man. - What's wrong with him? He's mentally ill. Everything that he's done, proves that. Only a sick man kills without motive. So what do you imagine his disease is then? Schizophrenia. I didn't realize you'd been studying psychiatry on the side. But let's leave the diagnosis to a real doctor, shall we? Meanwhile, do it my way. Are you sure he's in there? We haven't budged. Not even to take a leak. You two take him straight to the aquarium. I thought we'd been given orders to wait. I'm in command here you'll do as I say. Whose idea was this? Just to soften him up a bit, I thought... You thought? Get them out now. - Get me a white coat. - Yes, sir. Evilenko? I'm Comrade Lesiev. I'm a doctor. How are you feeling? Great. They won't get away with it, don't worry. - Are you worried? - Of course I am. Look at what they've done to you. You've got nothing to worry about, comrade. They didn't do anything to me. No-one can do anything to me. I'm already dead. Listen, Andrej. You're not dead yet. But you're in danger. Every one wants you dead because of all the things you've done. I can help you because I know how sick you are. If you want to help yourself you have to tell me everything. Let's start from the beginning. I was born in Ekaterinburg, on the 20th of October 1940. The sun was black that morning. The sky was dark and it was cold. They abandoned me. - He saved me. - Who saved you? - It was not a man. - What was it? A lion. I was inside the lion's mouth, but I wasn't afraid. And the lion took me into the woods and he left me there. But before leaving... he told me to choose. I chose to live my life as a communist. Who was the lion? Stalin? No names, comrade. No names. The lion is dead, they killed him. - Who did? - The cowards. What cowards? The cowards don't know the lion is inside me now. They can't kill him anymore. You tell that to Mr. Gorbachev the next time you see him. What's Gorbachev got to do with it? That's it. That's enough. I can't tell you everything. If you were a true communist, you'd be able to figure it out for yourself. Clothes off. Let me see what they've done to you. It's quite a number they did on you. But fortunately there's nothing broken. You're not a doctor. What makes you say that? I can tell by the way you look at me. You look at me like a woman. Why? Because I'm looking at it? Hey, I'm talking about him. Well, I'm afraid, he doesn't hear you. Right. I forgot. You're impotent. That's your whole problem, isn't it? That's not my problem, comrade. That's my privilege. - But you wouldn't know about that. - Know about what? Don't... don't ask stupid questions. If I tell you... we're finished. You've got to tell me. If you keep it in any longer, you'll explode. Alright, comrade. I'll tell you. The truth is that you're not impotent at all. Not when you spot a child on the street you're not. What happens in those moments, Andrej? What do you do, huh? You stare at him. Is that what you do? You stare at him, just like you're staring at me now. Where are you taking me? What's your name? Vadim Timurovich. And why aren't you at home at this hour of the day... Vadim Timurovich? Because... Because my father and mother are dead. I'm sorry, don't cry. I'm going to be the one to look after you now. But you must do everything I say. Take your clothes off now. What the hell is he doing? Has he gone mad? That's it, I've had enough of this! No-one goes in. Come closer, Vadim Timurovich. Oh, where are you taking me? Never mind. Come here. Now, I'm going to help you discover... something you could never even imagined existed. Give me your hand, come on, huh? Yeah. Do you feel it? Yes. Do you like it? Yes. Now... Do, do you feel it? Do you feel it? Yeah, it's starting to grow, starting to grow, you feel, do you? This is what it feels like when you sink your teeth into a child, this is how it feels when your mouth is full of blood. Blood that excites you and fills your prick, look at it, look at it! Look at your prick! You disgust me! Will you tell me, Andrej? Yeah. It's in my desk, in the office. But you can't read it. You'll have to bring it to me. I'm the only one who can read it. Well done, Lesiev, I'm really impressed. So you decided to go ahead and arrest him, did you? It must have been difficult to catch him? Evilenko has confessed. Really? So where's this confession then? - What's this? - His diary. He's put it all into drawings. Everything he did to his victims, every single detail, it's all here. Now there can be no doubt that the man's insane. The only nutcase around here is you, Lesiev. This diary, as you call it, is useless. It's just a comic book. If it weren't so gory I'd give it to my grandson. Your career ends right here, Lesiev. If you go, we all go and I'm speaking for everyone here. Thank you. But please stay. Don't allow this experience to go to waste. Because I'm afraid there will be many killers like him... and someone has to catch them. Vadim Timurovich! Quick! Come downstairs! He says he'll talk only to you. He wants to talk to you, Lesiev. You want me to interrogate him? He asked for you. After all, both of you are Communists, aren't you? I don't see the connection. It's very simple. You got us into this mess now you can get us out of it. If you can't get a confession out of comrade Evilenko, I'll just haul you before the court instead! Good day. Igor Mikailovich! - The diary. - I'm keeping it. I promised I'd bring it to him. You promised him? It'll be more difficult without it... Well it wasn't much good to me, so you can do without it. Would you like a clean one? But why? I'm in here. In there? But not anymore. I couldn't bring you your diary, Andrej. I knew it. I suppose that will make it more difficult for you to remember. If you look into my brain you will see the sky, comrade. But will you... allow me into your brain? In order for me to stop you coming in, I first have to let you out. Here's a list of the names, places and dates. I'd like you to take a look at it. That's thirty-six names. I don't think we've left anyone out, have we? What's wrong? - Get some paper and a pen. - We've got the tape-recorder. No... you'd better write it down. 15th of May 1984.

He was pronounced dead at 7:20 this morning.
