I was paid a lot of money to party with Richie. I'll admit it, the money was extraordinary and that first night in the house, we... I knew he was married and that I was insane and that it was insane. But there I was. I've never done anything like that before. Ever. But I kept going back. I kept getting paid. And I kept quiet. Even though Richie tried to keep what he was doing away from me I saw things, but I never asked him about it. The money was too good." I had something to tell you. What was it? I, uh... "Then one day he told me he loved me." I love you. "And I believed him." I love you, too. "Like a fool. Because I did love him." Gentlemen... I was with Richie now. I was his girl. I wasn't getting paid anymore but the parties at his house continued. And I kept quiet. Mickey kept bringing new bottle girls to Richie's house. They were lied to, they were told this was the way to a modeling career. Once they were in, they had no reason to get out. The money was too good. Which is how these men were able to get the girls high. Made them vulnerable. But still, I stayed quiet. I stayed quiet even when I found out Lolo wasn't just a promoter. He had a side deal with Mickey. He brought girls in from all over. Russia, Mexico, Ukraine. Mickey got them to work as bottle girls at first. That kept it legit. He promised them a better life. But Mickey was just weeding out the vulnerable ones. The desperate ones. The ones hardest up for money. Those are the ones that he brought to the house. And then we come into this house and they were selecting the girls like fruit from the grocery store. They were paying him for the girls. They were paying Richie. Most of them were drugged. The guys didn't care. God, it was disgusting. It was so vile. And this man that I thought that I loved... he was... he was in charge of all of it. When I finally confronted Richie about it, he lost his mind. I thought he was going to kill me. And he told me that he would if I told anybody. And then, when I told him I was leaving him, he said, "No, you're not. You can't leave. You're my girl. You're not going anywhere." Later that night, Larry, who had started feeling bad for me pulled me aside. You see, I had been journaling everything I was seeing. Everything. And Mickey found out. So, of course, he told Richie. Which meant I'd become a problem for Richie. Larry warned me that Richie was going to kill me that very night. He told me I had to run as soon as I could. Of course, had Richie found out Larry was texting me all that info, he would have killed us both. I was terrified, Zoe. I've never been that scared. I was desperate. I needed a miracle. That's when I heard somebody coming. I thought it was Richie. It wasn't. Poor girl. She overdosed. It was horrible. She was from Columbia, I think. Died right there, in front of me. I knew Richie would come for me soon. I didn't have much time. ♪ ♪ Now, before you judge me on this next part, remember, I was desperate. Desperate enough to notice that she and I were the same size. ♪ ♪ So, I switched dresses with her and I moved quickly. Oh, God, forgive me. What am I doing? Oh, my God. Rachel! - Rachel! - No, no, no. It's too late. It's too late. There's nothing you can do. Rachel! That poor girl. I could've warned her. I should have warned her, but I... kept quiet. Oh, God. I kept quiet. But as morbid as it sounds, you know, she... She saved my life. It's only a matter of time before they discovered that that body wasn't mine. Do dental records or something. And it's like a ticking clock. That's why I hired Vince. He was one of my clients. A unicorn. Um, I know what that is now. You're some kind of private eye investigator. Uh, not "Some kind of." I was doing recon at the club, trying to get Rachel's phone back from the house. Rachel's phone. Yeah, Larry and I had been texting those last few days. And he confirmed everything about Richie. Since he could track me with the phone I stashed it... and ran. It's all the evidence we need to show what Richie's been doing. Isn't it all on the cloud? You don't need the actual device? Richie got me that phone. It's all in his account and only a few select people in a circle had that number. Larry was one of them. Which is how Richie found out Larry was talking to you and your mom and Rachel, he read the texts. So then, Richie really did kill Larry. Actually, it was his goon that killed Larry. Held his head under water. Richie just watched. Zoe, we have to get that phone back. It's what we need to take them down Yes, it does. I just worked my way in the house last night to get it, when you showed up to take a dip. So, I have to break in there, tonight. Oh, my God, this is... Wow, this... I'm sorry, but this is such a Michael Connelly story. - Uh... - Who? Michael Connelly, the... the crime novels that I've been sending you that you haven't been reading. Sorry, I've been busy in Atlanta's seedy underworld. Right, okay. So then, what's the plan? What... When are we gonna head to his house? - We? - What? You-you thought you were gonna do this alone? - Yeah. - Come on. You've been to Richie's house. It's like a, a hexagon, uhh.. And there's, you know, the rooms. You're never gonna be able to find his bedroom without wasting time and you're gonna risk getting caught. I mean, Rachel, I mean, she knows where Richie's bedroom is, but she's dead. So that just leaves me. They think you're dead, too. I'm really sorry, I'm not like you. I'm going with you. Mom? Mom. Zoe. Oh, thank God. Oh. I had the worst dream. I thought you left me all alone. Mom, I'm, I'm here. It's okay. I'm sorry. I'm just so scared I'm gonna lose you, too. You're not. Mom, you're not gonna lose me. And I never should have left. I never should've left you and Rachel and I'm sorry. Oh, no. Shh. That was my fault. I was unhappy and I took it out on you and that's just not fair. I think that we're all gonna be okay. I do. Try and stay quiet. Last night, I left the back door open. Get in, get the phone, get out. Yeah, I know, I know. I got it. Shh! Just find the phone. Okay, here. This is Richie's bedroom. Okay, Rachel said it was behind the bed. I'm gonna look under the mattress. Here. You start with the master bedroom. It's just down the hall to the right. Hurry it up, please. I was wondering until you're done... Where'd you find this? ♪ ♪ - Had we not gone to you... - You knew there was a chance... that the phone wouldn't be there, that they would've already taken it. That's why there was a plan B. - You knew that. - Plan B sucks. Wait, whoa, what's plan B? You might as well tell her, I mean, she's obviously part of the team now. Percy is plan B. Percy? P-Percy, the owner of the club? She has no idea what Mickey's up to. And Percy would never get mixed up in something like that, and she's worked too hard to make that club her own. Yes, but she's not gonna believe me. She has no reason to. Right. So that's why that plan sucks. Okay. Oh, no, that's not why it sucks. Well, guess what? She will believe her if... If we can get our hands on Mickey's ledger. He records notes, names, all his business dealings in there. And it's enough information to put him and Richie away for life. And that's why plan B sucks. Wait, I don't know why, why does that suck? That doesn't suck. That's a classic crime novel McGuffin. A ledger with all the incriminating evidence? - I mean, come on! - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Except this isn't like some novel of you download on your Kindle to read during your summer break from your real job as a teacher. Easy, Vince. Easy? You want me... You want me to take it easy, Rachel? Mickey's not gonna just hand us the ledger, which means we have to physically take it from him. Hence, plan B sucks. What is your problem? Seriously! I-I don't know why you're doing this. I know why we're doing this, but I don't know why you're doing this, and if you have some kind of problem just go, okay? We got this. - This is personal for us. - Zoey... Vincent's sister got wrapped up in this world last year. Different club. She got involved with the wrong guys, then ended up for sale. He hadn't heard from her in a while so he went to her apartment and... found her body, she had overdosed. So, um, this is personal for me, too. So, are we good? Are we, uh, gonna do this? - Yeah. - Yeah, okay. So, what we do know is Mickey never parts ways with that ledger. So, that's a good thing because then we always know where it is at all times. And if we can pull this off tonight it would be a two-fer. Richie's at the club on Fridays. We can take them both down tonight. Yeah, the tricky part's going to be getting into the club. You both...
