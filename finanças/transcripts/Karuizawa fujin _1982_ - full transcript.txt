NIKKATSU 70th Anniversary A Nikkatsu Presentation Madam? The water has frozen. I apologize. I forgot to empty the jar. It's not your fault. Winters are rigorous at Karuizawa. However, summer always comes back! LADY KARUIZAWA Production: Yutaka Okuda, Akihiko Yamaki Original work: Akira Sagashima Script: Akio I do Cinematographer: Yonezo Maeda Cast Miwa Takada, Takayuki Godai Yumi Yoshikawa, Yoshio Tsuchiya, Toshiyuki Kitami Karuizawa, Karuizawa... Karuizawa, Karuizawa... Directed by: Masaru Konuma Nice serve! That suits you so well. Very well indeed. Girls are going to jump on you. Boss, let me introduce you the new waiter. We met each other at university. He seems like a good boy. How many guys have you fucked since you arrived? In here, we work and we fuck. I work in a jewellery shop. It's well known. Do you know it? Yes. Do you want to do it? I'm not in the mood. That's lame. Why are you here, then? Listen carefully. Don't forget, to serve the duck at the same time as the foie gras. The foie gras is always served with dry wine. The appetizer is a fish salad. The main dish, suckling pig and roast beef. You mustn't take the strings off from the meat. - Hey, are you listening? - Yes. Genichiro Nakagawa. The president of Nakagawa Enterprises. No, the organizer of tonight's party. Ah. Nakagawa Enterprises. 8 billion of capital, 28 branches... Wow. The company has grown by working with politicians after the war. Zennosuke Okazaki, president of Okazaki Industries, is part of the family. Look! It's Okazaki's mansion! Wow! You know everything. Before coming here, I read ?The Karuizawa Mansion Guide?. Really? You guys! Don't make the kitchen dirty! What will you wear for the job? Of course, we brought tuxedos. Were you the one sent by the boss at Ceaser's? Yes. I'm counting on you. Yes. Ms. Nakagawa, thank you. These are my friends. Your party is wonderful. She must go abroad as well. The media don't stop talking about it. The government should find a quick solution for the crisis. We win from one side what we lose from the other. We can't win in all fronts. Ah, good evening, Mr. Nakagawa. Thank you for inviting us. Good evening to you all. Please forgive my lateness. Hey, hurry up. The guests have to be served. Excuse me. Miss Aya! - When did you arrive from the States? - I just came back. The Madam is always so beautiful, but she always maintains a sad look. Is she still separated from Mr. Nakagawa? She lives alone in Karuizawa. Nakagawa only sees her a few times during the year. And he has a lover in Tokyo. That's why he confines his wife in the Karuizawa mansion. Because of a lover in Tokyo. What an exuberant life! - Discard everything. It has expired. - Yes. - Hey, you! - Yes? Go find me a guest that is called Aya Takakura. Miss Nakagawa will know who the person is. Give me the house's key. Can't you see my aunt? Tell her that I'm still in the States. The pork is ready! Don't you have any shame? Stop starring at my aunt. Are you jealous, Aya? Me? Jealous? - And the marijuana? - Over the phone. Don't come late. Don't bring girls to the house. No. You know me. I know your taste. Stay away from bad girls. "Peace''? Cheers! Cheers! What are you doing? That was the main dish for the guests! Idiot! Clean everything quickly! I'm very sorry. Quick! Clean it up. Please, accept my apologies, Mr. President. You did a good job. Stop it! Your hand must be treated. Don't blame him, please! It is me who is asking. Hurry up! Go serve the next dish! Yoshiko! What are you doing?! Don't stay with him like that. - But... - What's with that look?! Do you want to stand up for this man? Dear! Why on the earth... have the boss at Ceaser's sent us that idiot? I wanted... to protect him. You fool! It was not a simple party, but a business night for the Nakagawa Company! With very important guests! What? Is it possible that you're embarrassed of the way I reacted at the party? - I need to change, dear! - There's no need! I'll undress you myself. Come on. We haven't seen each other for 5 months. I haven't seen Yuichi for a year. You didn't want to see him? Yuichi? Is he alright? Aren't you worried about him? I put him in a catholic boarding school. I see no reason to worry about him. Dear, stop it, please. What's with you tonight? You can hate me as much as you want. You want to know who owns your family company? It's me! Here, just let it go... - You know why I'm do this? - Yes. You've made a big mistake. It's only normal to be fired over that. I didn't know what to say to Mr. Nakagawa. Walking through vibrant streets Filled with sparkling neon lights Sorrow invades me through a grilling hangover The empty station is waiting for me My heart filled with love still beats for the one I've lost I must leave, leave this city And unravel my sweet memories That night, the sleep will escape me All alone inside the cabin of my wagon-lit I know that I must raise my head And dry my tears before I leave Good bye... Oh, good bye... The rain follows my steps - Goodbye. - I feel like a beast. Don't say that. I came to Karuizawa to change my life. And here I am, a tramp again. Me too. I come here each year expecting to find a good guy. But... while I was waiting, I started to become older. The cold rain falls on our shoulders Without going back, I'll find happiness A ticket to Tokyo. Alone at the empty dock, I walk without a goodbye The heart filled with a sweet bitterness Good bye Oh, good bye... So, which place do you want to visit tomorrow? I wonder... Excuse me. You are... I'm very sorry for the incident at the party. The boss at Ceaser's said that you were fired for that. - Was that necessary? - Yes. I deserved it. Because of us you got yourself hurt. Me and my husband apologize for that. Don't apologize. I must thank you for standing up to me. I also have to thank your husband for giving me the chance to meet you again. What do you want? - Coffee. - Alright. - Ice-cream! - Very well. Do you want to join us? Yes. What are you thinking of doing at the moment? I don't know. I know that I have to go back to Tokyo and find work. I need to sustain myself. - Are you a student? - Yes. Don't you want to give private lessons in Karuizawa? Nobody knows who I am. It will be for him. I'm searching for someone to take care of Yuichi's studies. He doesn't have friends here. Of course, I'll pay you a salary. I want my son to spend a pleasant vacation. I can only stay with him during the summer and winter vacations. Please, think about my proposal. I accept it with pleasure. Aren't you glad? Yes! Mommy! That's a good horse. Come on! Come back! Teacher! You fool! Are you alright? When I was little, I used to come here a lot with my sister. After she passed away, I rarely visited again. Don't be afraid to ask if you need anything. Maki will provide anything. Thank you. Mommy, look! Oh, it's so pretty! Don't go too far! Yes, mommy. I haven't yet realized it... This is a great opportunity for me. Thanks to you, Yuichi is having a great time. - Tomorrow, my bus leaves at 9h. - Understood. Bye bye. Look! It's here! Mommy, we found it! The pygmy woodpecker comes from the Picides family. Tell me where it sleeps. He builds his house in the trees. Here we have! - Thanks! - You're welcome. You should monitor him, aunt. - You're talking about who? - Him. And his sweet poison. Poison? That's right. You're a target for him. How so? He wants to possess you. You are rich and beautiful. You know important people. He wants to take advantage of you. You're his target... I don't think so. I hope it's sunny tomorrow. Yes. We must leave early. We must arrive before dawn in order to listen to the birds. Madam loves this piece. It's from Mozart. She loves the second movement the most. I also listened to it during the party at that moment. - It's done! - Thanks. Mr. Shito, do you have a girlfriend? - No. - Ah... have a good night. Good night. It's the pygmy woodpecker! It's a bit scary. It's a Swinhoe's snipe. And this is the Latham's snipe. You know them very well. I've read a bird's guide. Ah, an owl! Aren't you cold? I'm fine. You should have brought a coat. - Aren't you really cold? - No. Your hands are cold, though. - Mr. Shito! - Madam... A Great Spotted Woodpecker! Madam! - We can't. - Madam. Mr. Shito... Stop it. Don't make me have to send you back. Do we really have to go, teacher? Ah, an owl! A Great Spotted Woodpecker! Madam! - Madam. - We can't. You love this piece. Maki told me. This is scarcely believable... For me too. Do you regret it? I... I don't know why I did it. I don't know who I am anymore. Madam, I want to stay with you. But... summer is coming to an end... That's right. And I'm married. Madam. Madam! No... No... Stop it! Here. What are you thinking about? Nothing. You think this is your home now. The Madam is upstairs. With my uncle? Yes. They are in their room! You look worried. Of what? Of them. My aunt and you get along very well. Karuizawa is a little village. People are noticing you. Do you think... that the high society of Karuizawa belongs to you already? - Good morning! - Oh! You're in good shape. - Yes. - How is Masakazu doing? I know that he went back to the States. He hasn't changed. Uncle, let me introduce you the teacher that aunt has hired for Yuichi. What do you think? He should refund the damage from the party. Aren't you worried for your wife? Opportunity makes the thief. But who is the thief? - Who is taking advantage of whom? - Dear! If you excuse me! This is some interesting thing, for sure. Don't you agree, Yoshiko? Answer me! I want to kill him... I want to kill your husband. You have slept with him in this room... No! Yuichi! Yuichi! Madam! Come quick! Madam! Yuichi! Yuichi! Hang in there! Madam! - Yuichi! - Yuichi! Yuichi! What happened? I wasn't aware that he left on his own... - Hurry, call the doctor! - Yes. The gods have punished me. It's my punishment! Forgive me! - Let me carry him. - No! I should do it! Excuse me. Go home, please. Aren't you working today? Were you dismissed? But you shouldn't worry. If you want, I can take care of you. I wonder if my father is there. Your father? But then, you are... the heir of Okazaki Industries? Yes, I'm the spoiled son of Zennosuke Okazaki. Drink with me. I allow you to belong to our great family. The outfit suits you well. We're going to spend a very delicious evening. Don't you want to drink too? Sit down. Not there. On the floor. - Drink it. - Drink it. Lick it. Do it. Come on. What's wrong with you? You can return if you wish. - I have news for you. - I'm listening. We have the confirmation that Masakazu Okazaki, 26 years old, was involved in a drug party organized in Los Angeles. Nevertheless, the evidence is still not definitive. I see. Interpol is an international organization. They do a great job! Indeed. Mine is nothing more than a department of the criminal police. - Here. - Thank you. It's a shocking case. That's true. But, if we catch Masakazu Okazaki, the media can unleash an even greater scandal. I hope that you're not already tired of the life of the rich. You're one of ours. Yes, you've passed the exam. - The exam? - Yes. And since you've passed it... you're going to help me kill someone. Is it okay? It's nothing too hard. We are a team. I have to kill this person. I admit that my situation is complicated. But, if I get rid of this person, I'll not have to worry anymore. Furthermore, if they believe that I died because of him, I can kill two birds with one stone. We'll bury his corpse the deepest we can. The day he'll be found, there'll be nothing more than bones. The police will not be able to distinguish between me and him. And, if everyone thinks I'm dead, I'll be pulled off from the case. After the murder, I'll go far away. Everyone will want my head. So, you're with me? I'm speaking as a comrade. You're already involved. But our relationship has to go even further. I'm joking, buddy! Wasn't I convincing? Right? Have you decided? Are you ready to follow us? What are you afraid of? Afraid? For me, this is a second chance. Madam... Maybe I'll not see you again. Mommy! Masakazu? Masakazu? Why isn't he here? What is happening?! Masakazu? He's dead! Who did it?! Who killed him?! If anyone discovers the corpse... it will be an enormous scandal! And they'll think it was us who killed him! Help me. Hurry up! I decided to marry you. We're partners in crime. If I tell the truth to the police, it'll be the end for the both of us. Are you threatening me? If I fall, you're falling too. I've kept Masakazu's wedding ring. I took it from his corpse. When I become your husband, your family will offer me an important position. You should be the one who died! That was the plan! I knew it all along. You thought... that I was an easy target? Masakazu! Serve me. Welcome, miss. Aunt. Long time no see. We just got engaged. - What about Masakazu? - I chose the man closer to my heart. Jun'ichi loves me much more. Isn't it so? Answer. Yes, I love you. Congratulations. Thank you, aunt. Yuichi will go back to Tokyo tomorrow. His summer vacation is coming to a close. Is that so? I'll have the watercress soup with sauteed crayfish. And then, the rabbit cooked with herbs. What's wrong? A Great Spotted Woodpecker! Madam... Madam! Mr. Shito wants to see you. Tell him to leave. Yes. Madam! Madam. Go home, please. I'm aware that I was just your target. Madam! What you say was the truth yesterday. But today is no longer the case. You're engaged with Aya. I'll congratulate you again. I'm not engaged for love. What a cruel confession. Aya will not forgive you. Aya believes in your love. I'm asking you to make her happy. Madam! I still love you. You're about to get married. How dare you? Madam! Madam! I've got engaged with Aya because of a crime. A crime? A corpse is buried in the forest of Kashima. Behind the garden of the second house of Zennosuke Okazaki. You don't believe me? That can't be... Mr. Shito, why? Hello? I want to verify an information. The corpse? Everyone is talking about it. The corpse... The corpse! Madam, are you alright? Thank you for everything. I'm leaving the mansion today. This morning, a corpse has been found in the forest of Kashima. Is that so? - I just wanted to verify it! - And now? Do you believe me? Yes. But you'll be detained! That's fine. I... I just destroyed your life! That's fine. I'm happy to have your trust back. This morning, Mt. Asama looked so scary, despite its usual beauty. Madam! I want to die in your arms. Me too. I want to die! The man who killed Masakazu Okazaki belonged to a violent gang. Okazaki was the victim of a vengeance. Shito did nothing but bury his Corpse. The killer saw him from afar. Is that so? Are you the "Madam"? Excuse me? It's you who called the police, isn't that right? Yes. Do you live in Karuizawa for a long time? Winter must be rigorous this year too. "Winter"? Karuizawa's winter suits me very well. I see. Your husband is waiting. I've heard about the boy's death. Yes. With a severed head, his beauty is less seductive. Are you sad for him? No. Bring a cold drink to my room. And. Starting from today, I'll sleep in my own room. Get the bed ready. Yes, madam. Why are you doing that? Yoshiko. Yoshiko! THE END
