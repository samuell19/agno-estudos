ALL DEPENDENT CHARACTERS AND EVENTS IN THIS MOVIE ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS We thank the residents of Bhoodan Popampally, Muktapur, GhousEGonda, PEDDARAVULAPALLI AND BEERAMGUDA FOR THEIR COOPERATION CHALTE CHALTE - Lady, coolie? - No thanks. I do not need help Excuse me... hey sir I need a taxi. It costs 3 lakhs. I have not come to buy the taxi. But I'm here to sell it. Pointless partner. Hello I need a taxi Sorry, will the taxi come to Rajanagaram? It will not. I should drive it. Everyone here is an idiot. Will you come to Rajanagaram if you drive? No way. The deal is already done for Rajahmundry. - I'm just waiting for the passenger. - Dammit. Not even a single person responds adequately. Looking for a taxi lady? Where you come from? - United States - Oh great! My taxi is also very good. You know, three taxis are famous in India. One is Income Taxi, two is Toll Taxi and the third is my taxi. The idiot doesn't know the difference between a tax and a taxi. Well, my name is Santosh. Mom calls me honey and dad calls me Chinna. losing friends call me Santhu. You can call me whatever you want ma'am Driver. Get my luggage. Yes ma'am. Shall I say something, ma'am? All the drivers here drive their taxis. But I love my taxi. - Why? Can't you drive? - I didn't mean that ma'am. Isn't it said that we have to love our work? Why do I need you? tell me about your taxi It's close to the range of a Benz. It may not reach the level of a Range Rover, but it's decent To conclude easily, think of it as CMW, brother of BMW. Is this what you were talking about so much? Absolutely ma'am. Is this a car? It sucks and it's disgusting. How could you speak so loudly about a car like that? How could you do this? Madam! It's wrong to judge a movie by its teaser and a show by its promotion. Similarly, it is wrong to underestimate my car by its external appearance, ma'am. Take a look inside. Come on. - It is bad. - Than? It is very bad. Will this taxi reach Rajanagaram? Don't say that. You're the first client I've had. Please come in. No way What's in it? There is no air conditioning, music system or anything. Give me one good reason to board this cab. There is no other taxi for you to board, ma'am. Should I start then? Only once you remove that board from there. What's wrong with the lady on the board? You can see it well! The car is pretty bad on its own. Take it off first! Start the car. - Can I say something if you don't mind? - huh? You look so beautiful ma'am. but your behavior is a bit abnormal. It is? Thank you. Look at the road and drive. By the way, what's your name, ma'am? Isn't it convenient to address me as madam? Just do that. Yes mate, I'm traveling. - Where are you? - I'm on my way. - Watch out - OK, see you. Are you talking on the phone while driving? Do you have any sense? Yes, I have my license ma'am. Pointless partner. - Madam - yes? Don't you ever smile? Do. I smile when my boss makes a bad joke. I smile when my relatives ask me if I'm okay. and I'm usually smiling when I'm with my friends. But why would he smile at a driver after all? and why should i Ma'am, don't call me driver over and over again. I feel uncomfortable. Shall I call a driving doctor instead? Hello! I have a name, that is Santosh. Ok driver Santosh. Are you happy now? Santosh driver? Look, you are the driver and I am the temporary owner of this taxi. This relationship is fine to travel 4 hours together with you. Don't ask for anything else. I want some quiet. Do you have a drinking water driver? Hello, this is water in general. I only drink mineral water. Come on, it's almost the same. This is high in fluorine. Fluorosis can affect us. Legs and hands may be disfigured. There would be bacteria on it. We can get cholera and even diarrhea. We can have many ailments such as hepatitis, trachoma, arsenicosis, etc. I heard people die from smoking and drinking ma'am. But for the first time I heard from you that we could also die drinking water! Stop the car if you see a department store on the way. I'll get a bottle of water. - Get going now! - Yes Yes. What is this box? That's not a lady box, this is the department store you're looking for. But you won't get the water you need in this place. What are you talking about? Hyderabad has the metro and Amaravathi became the capital. Won't mineral water come here? Such confidence? Let's see then. - What do you want, dear? - Grandpa, mineral water please. - He speaks in Telugu. - Sorry. Do you have mineral water grandpa? I'll bring it to you. Look Here it is dear. Grandpa, this is Mirinda. I ordered mineral water. What's that? Kinley, Bisleri, Aquafina. We don't have those new cold drinks here. They're not cold drinks, grandpa. I mean don't drink water. What is the need for money for water dear? - Savitri - What's up dear? Bring some drinking water in a glass. - Have it dear. -Yuck No thanks grandpa. She gave it with love ma'am. Have some. I would be hospitalized if I drink it feeling like this. Cool drinks then? They contain fertilizers and pesticides. Why do you fear? They don't even kill pests on farms. No way. Don't worry grandpa. She is a little crazy. Has she lost it? - Yes! See ya. - Okay son. Oh! I wonder what her father would be like! Falling in love is not bad. It's not bad to get married too. But opting for a love marriage is wrong. That's like a hybrid seed. Mix two different races into a new one. look my dear Do you know the value of your father in the village? He thought to give 25 Lakhs as a dowry to the guy who marries you. That means the value of it is 25 lakhs And this boy? He can't even be sold for $10, even with $25 in his pocket. Didn't you get it? I'm not saying he's worthless. I say that the value is in a negative state. A parent is not the one who pays school fees or gives you pocket money. He is the one who wonderfully designs the lives of his children. He's an engineer! We dream of building their lives as concrete structures... ...but you build your lives on loose earth and collapse them. Isn't everyone a human lord? It is? Look Gandhi's smile on a 10 rupee note and a 2000 rupee note is the same. So do they have the same value? The value differs per note. Marry her with me sir. I will take good care of her. - Oh! What did you study? - I already did my graduation. If you get a job with your degree certificate, you will be paid $10,000. Put the expenses aside, that doesn't pay the energy bill either. Even if you deposit that at Grameena Vikas Bank and apply for a loan… ...they won't give you more than $50,000. You can't run your house or marry this girl with that. How well would you take care of her? - See Kondayah. - Mr. Ask your son to fall in love. There is nothing wrong with that. But ask him to calculate the value of him, the value of him as a son and the value of the father of that girl and then do it. But only because the girl next door looks like Samantha or if the neighbor's daughter looks like Tamanna ask him not to fall in love with them. I got it? -Take it, he's tired. - As you say sir. Come on son He takes the girl inside the sister. wait there If a train is off the tracks, it is not the fault of the train. It is with the driver. Likewise, if a daughter gets out of hand It is the father's mistake. It's not wrong to make a mistake. But it is wrong not to correct it knowing that it is a mistake. Come on, keep her in control. - Did you get a taxi? - Yes. I have a laugh. - How's the driver? - It's like the taxi. Baby, you're saying it's a laugh. Would that come to our house? That would not happen mom. - Okay, be careful. - Well. What are you looking at? Let's go to study! Why are you looking at me like I'm a rapist? A broken down car is as common as an air leak. Stop your appointments and see what needs to be done. Well. The worst driver, the worst taxi and the worst trip. Disgusting! Madam! I have an idea! Hey! You're crazy? Not that, the second. oh this! Well. Thank God, is it done? Yes it is. Close it then. You did well watching YouTube. But would it start the car? What is wrong now? You see it? Won't you at least thank me? Because I should? That was my 4G balance. So it helped. "Oh God! What is that annoyance?" "Oh God! What is that behavior?" "Oh God! What is that ego?" "Oh my God!" "She Looks Nothing Like" "Whatever it is, she looks weird" "I can't stand the trip with this demon" "It is my destiny that it is written" "My car is excellent, it is the brother of Range Rover" "It's better if you stop your anger" "You see yourself before sir" "It's dangerous to look around" "Look, there is a speed switch" "you're just a driver" "God! She is a crazy man." "Come on man." "Oh God!" "Control your speed a little" "There is no guarantee for our lives" "Will I be afraid of your boasting?" "I've seen a lot of those people." "I'll teach you a lesson if you talk like crazy" "Look at your face in the mirror." "You are better than me, do you know who I am?" "I'm going to tear down all your ego dear lady" "Come on man." "Oh God! She's too crazy" "Untamable!" "Get lost idiot" "I'll Make You Straight" "What is this complication?" "Start now without bothering me!" "Oh devil, you made my heart happy" "You're not fit for a guy like me" "What's your problem, stop bothering and move on" "I'm NRI and you're a slum dog, do you know what my rank is?" Why are you so angry when I joke around for fun, dear? "It's enough if you stay calm, baby" "Get lost man!" "She's So Weird" "She had never seen someone so strange" What is she looking for? Why did you stop here? You're nothungry? I? I'm not hungry. Hell with her ego. Madam, she will miss a great taste if she doubts it. The Sambar here is so good you should try it at least once before you die. And the Rasam... ... trust me, it consists of all emotions. Oh now I see. The dal in my house is so tasty that it is difficult to describe it. And the ghee we added to that is inexplicable even in a 1000 page book. God... I can also tell those stories. Better start the vehicle first. You don't need to pay for my meals. I can pay my 100 dollars. It is? How much do you earn per day? 300 dollars. So you have lunch with 100 and give the remaining 200 at home? I have $50 sandwiches at night and I give the rest of the $150 at home. Everyone in America eats to live, but you live to eat. Gives you no shame? A human should eat once every four hours. Will you eat or not? I will not do it So I'm not eating too. And why do you do that? Madam, you are my passenger and I am your driver. I am happy if you are happy. I'm hungry if you're hungry. - Are you seriously not going to eat? I will not do it. Downstairs, I'll eat. Really? I'll eat like you're giving it up too. But I'm not hungry at all. How far have you come dear? I'm going to have lunch at a hotel, mom. It may be a little late until it arrives. And is your bag safe? He's in the taxi. You innocent! Will someone steal the bag if it's in the car? Keep it with you. - Ok, don't call me repeatedly to warn me. - Well. Goodbye. Did you take the order man? I'll take it brother. Are you using an iPhone? Did a passenger lose it? Huh. You never say anything nice, ma'am? This one is mine - Did you buy it? - Yes. I have it in seconds. I can not believe it. Taxi drivers and hotel servers like you I can't even buy an iPhone on the third or fourth deal, forget seconds. It is? One minute. Brother! Let the woman see your phone once. She is a brother iPhone 6 plus Please take a look. Curse my fate. Grandma. Can you show your phone one time? There ma'am. samsung note 3 son I am planning to change it as it is hanging. samsung note 3? and you want to change it while it hangs? My foot, look at my phone. Curse my fate! This is the India you see... We make sure to be decently luxurious even though we do not earn salaries in lakhs. What do you say grandma? Hey, look what you need. Brother, can I sit here? Come and sit down. Don't let it. It seems like being a thief. You stop looking at people negatively first. Be positive I say! Sit down. Be positive idiot. - Are you hungry friend? - Yes brother Three full meals with cold drinks. - Eat well man! Do not hesitate - It's okay brother. - My bag - Give me back the bag! Hey, they leave without paying the bill. Hey! Give me back the bag! Where do you go without paying money? Come on, pay! He has my bag and all my money is in it. I don't watch movies? Isn't he one of you? oh man! Wouldn't we finish eating it if we wanted to escape? Why would we run away without eating a bite too? I don't need logic, pay the bill and go. - You want money? - Yes. One minute. My God, I lost my bag! Trying to deliver the dialogue? Don't do the movie trick on me. Sir, even movie stories are taken from life. It is not like this? That's the reason why I won't be fooled like the clowns in the movie. I can't make you grind the dough or clean the utensils. I can't even make you cook since you don't seem to know anything without using Youtube. Pay immediately and go. Pay! Hey! Don't you understand that we don't have money? Penniless? Oh! My daughter doesn't have a watch to wear! Movement! My bag! Drive fast! - My bag! - Give the bag to the man! Faster! Slow down, man! Speed ​​up! You could even make it to Vizag by the time your car starts. Get down, we'll catch it - Hello my bag. - I'm going. Stop right there! - Hey, stop there kid. Faster ma'am. - Hello, rascal! You demon child! We would have caught him if your car had started. To hell with your worthless car. You wouldn't have lost your bag if your mom hadn't called first. - Don't blame my mother. - Don't blame my car either! My grandfather gave me that watch before he passed away. How much is a gift worth when the person is dead? - What did you say? - We're leaving now? I am very hungry That is not a problem, since you are very strong. You said that a human would feel hungry once every four hours, right? We say a lot when we have money. But we don't have it now, do we? Should I put posters on the car bro? Hey, this is not a car man. It's a car. It doesn't look like a car! I don't mean free. I'll pay you $100 per poster. $100 per poster? Yes! And you have to keep them awake for a week. - A whole week? - Only a week? Okay, give me 200 bucks and stick 2 of them. Do it 4. You know what, do it 6. -6 is a better number - Six? We could use the money in the future. Should I paste them or not? Hey, pay first and then paste them where you want. Six of them. Don't miss the count. here Hello. Would you at least tell me your name now? sruthi Sruthi Keerthana Sruthi madam, what is your opinion on love? - Oh! Do. - You do? she tell me Love means... Yes, does love mean? It is a useless job done by two unemployed people that turns into a job. Do you understand or should I repeat? No ma'am! Actually, Shakespeare was also a bit confused about love. but you are clear about that! Keep going. You start to ask our opinion about love when we say our name. Then you exchange glances and then handshakes. And then you keep taking a lot of advantages. That's why I keep people like you at a distance, Santosh. Have the Pulav, it's tasty. Have some water son. You must eat it all without wasting any. Grandpa will buy you a chocolate if you finish it. come on eat Yes very good. I have no idea where this guy is Hello Mr Dorababu. What's up Subbarao? Did you hear that your son had a love marriage? Well, they say he ran away! What a waste of dowry! Sit down. You can't free your son and daughter since the country has freedom, man! They call send messages worth 50 rupees like love... ...and calls to exchange a couple of garlands worth a hundred dollars as a marriage. With your $150 investment endanger our prestige in the city and the income we get from their marriage like our tailor Seetharam cuts a piece of blouse. It's not just about kids staying home. it is about whether they are controlled or not. Only then our respect in the village grows like a dollar and does not fall like a rupee. Look how I raised my son. Listen, I turned on the speakerphone. one minute lady - Yes Dad. - What is that song son? That's a hit song from Ilayaraja. Why don't you put on Devisri Prasad's "To dad with love"? I will dad. Where are you Whose driver is it? Who is that? Ma'am is coming. - I'm on my way dad. - On my way? Hello! is offline It seems that your son is also out of control. He is young. That doesn't mean he's not in control. Hey, what are you looking at and what are you laughing at? Look over there. - Is the car yours? - Yes it is. So are you such an idiot? - Where is this guy? - This one is also similar. Equally? That's enough now. Kindly leave us alone. Hello! That is really enough. I hope you had a laugh. You are amazing. Please stop now. You shouldn't remove it for up to a week! Hey! You didn't tell me the name of the movie was this bad man! I don't know, you have to leave it like that. Hey, he is an unjust man! Is he? Give me the 600 bucks back then! I do not have it. - Don't you? Then he comes back and drives. Come on man! What are you looking at now? He starts the car. Why are you laughing? Why are you laughing. Only if I'd known you'd laugh I would have put up the posters at the train station. You have a great smile, Mrs. Sruthi. You keep smiling and my taxi will reach your town without fuel. Thank you. "Are you the beauty of Veturi's songs?" "The wealth of Sirivennela's songs is yours?"

Don't worry, have some water relax, relax Who are they? Srinu and his gang tease the girl every day by blocking her path. There they are. I didn't stop even after being asked today. They are still behind me. Start the car brother, they are too dangerous. Okay, calm down. Don't get tense. Just sit here. I'll take care of it. Hey! Where are you going? You don't know about them. You don't know about me either. How dare you make fun of girls, idiots? Apologize to her and get lost. And what you gonna do if we don't get lost baby? You are just a simple woman. What could you do? A tiger is a tiger, whether it's a female or a male, moron. Oh no, what is she doing? Lady. Hey, you come in. I'll take care. You know that I am a holder of a black belt in Karate. We also have black belts. Show here guys. Don't you know the difference between a fancy belt and one earned by beating up men? How did it hit you so hard, friend! He wouldn't get up. Next... Won't you just look at me Hit your man. He hit the forbidden spot, go hit her guys. How dare you kick him in the back! Would you make fun of girls again? Excuse your rotten meat! My hand is going to break, please let me. Hey mom, my friends have enough. But I'm going home to eat. Thank you sister. Her name has rhythm, but her fight doesn't, Mrs. Sruthi. Where did you learn Karate? I learned it from Pawan Kalyan Do you need that? Where are you going dear? I go to the temple. is very famous Is near. Why do not you come? Well. Let's go. come sister Go ahead, we'll check the place. Well. Come let us pray. I don't believe in praying. An unbeliever? You're a scientist? Do not. - I hope you're not sadistic! - Than? I mean, it's usually the scientists and the sadists who don't believe in God. So I asked. I got it But not about the gods you pray to. They are different. Who are they? My parents... are my gods. I believed in the gods you are talking about in my childhood. I prayed for good grades on my exams. But I didn't understand them. Later, my father took care of himself, joined me in a good school and taught me well. That's when I served well. So my dad is my god. They say that God punishes those who do evil. He is not like that. but my mother used to hit me when she did something wrong She wouldn't have known what was right and what was wrong if she hadn't. So they are my gods. Sister, did you pray to God? Not yet. The god here is very powerful Come and pray to him. What are you looking at? She believes that everything goes well for us if we pray to God. So, there is nothing wrong in putting aside our beliefs for her, the driver Santosh. You don't even know how to put on a bindi. Just like my dad. What about the lights now? Just a minute ma'am. - Tell me. - Why don't the lights work, man? They wouldn't. I called to say that but you didn't answer my call. Shouldn't you have told me this earlier? Did you notice the name of the taxi? Name? It's tomorrow taxi. Do you understand why I called it that? And what about the night? It's good for parking at night but not for traveling. See you later, come back carefully. Hello! Damn, idiot. What happened? - Lights. - Aren't they going to work? - Yes, ma'am, are you shocked? - I would have if they'd worked. It's too late. Let's take a walk. There may be tigers here. This forest is so dense that even an insect cannot enter. How can tigers reside then? They will not. That's why they go out on the road to walk. And eat dinner if they find a human and call their family for a feast if they see two. Then what do we do? I see a light there. We'll see. Yes? Hi sir. - Who are you? - We're victims of the car, man. Actually, it never gives a problem. But suddenly it gave us a problem today. I want to say that all the way is a forest and we plan to go for a walk without resting sir But we were afraid that we might be a feast for some beast at this worst time. so we saw your guest house between east and west We feel that this is the best place to rest at night. So we came here without wasting any more time. So, if you give us the permission... So, do you want to rest in my beautiful house for free? and you leave once you have breakfast in the morning? That's almost true sir. Well. Sorry, a week ago a couple of lovers like you came over and showed some dubious behavior. Oh no, we're not lovers, aunty. Are they friends then? Don't we know it's always the same way? We are lovers, aunt. and we are also friends as you expected uncle. But first of all, we're married. What the hell is he talking about? You should have tied the sacred thread around his neck before trying to fool us. Oh yeah! Where is the? Didn't we mortgage him when he had diarrhea? It is true. Where are the rings on the fingers? He went up the stairs once because of them. I immediately threw them away. It's love dude. Whatever you say, we can't believe you're married. Do you see what they are talking about? Our trip has gone crazy because of you. My life is ruined just because of you. I had no reason to request them if you hadn't come into my life. Why do you blame me? It was you who wasted time. - No, it's you. - No, it's you! - Are you! - Are you! Stop both of you! If you are fighting over such a small issue, you are undoubtedly married. - Okay, please come in. - Yes. Well. This is your room. cool off - Our room? - Yes. Don't we have separate rooms? Separate rooms? Somehow I doubt... Now I feel why I married her. - I always feel the same. - You'll get a slap. I understand. You are husband and wife for sure. Go freshen up and come to dinner. Fast. - Hello. - Hello. Hello I see Lord Shiva and Jesus in one picture... - Err.. - We exchanged hearts. not religions Take a sit Doesn't love really mean understanding the tastes of others? Love has become so easy nowadays. They're texting to say I love you and calling to talk and video calling to see and talk only on phone calls and video calls if they want to see each other. I don't understand if it's girls or Android phones that love their generation kids. In our days, love consisted of letters, seeing in secret, messengers and it took us months to talk to the girl we like and it took them years to notice us. and about love it used to take decades. There are no breaks in our love stories in those days, as there was so much love. So, was yours a love-married uncle? So what? Do you think the mediator brought this white girl's match for me? Come on Did you like it so much uncle? What's so special about the guy, that you didn't see in the boys from London? Mustache, that Indian mustache made me fall in love. By the way How long have you been married? - One year man. - One month. It's a month over a year actually. Who proposed first among you? Is it you or you - It's her - he. It is very confusing. Uncle... She proposed to me when I thought that... ...and I proposed to her when she was thinking. - Which means... - We both did it at the same time. So they both did it first. So... Don't ask us anything else uncle. We forget everything. Friend, when can we remember our love story of the last 25 years Don't you remember your year? I mean we can't put it into words. So you sing man, come on. Sing now Come on. Will come. Why is he trying so hard? Isn't it coming out? Sing man! "I had seen her in a sari once." "I sent my love through a love letter unable to stop my love after seeing it" "She never speaks and she never raises her head" "She never looks at me and I just go blank" "I sold milk and flowers to win this girl's love" Oh no! "I happily heard her scold and faced many problems" "She has a great magic that has drowned my heart" "Some change in that touch that raised the tone of my heart" "When those anklets move with your feet, hundreds of tides rise in my heart" "If beauty calls me even once, I celebrate as if she has won the whole world" "Should I change even fate as we want if I have your love?" Do I have to thank the creator throughout my life for creating this beautiful doll? "The moon is for the sky, similarly, is this beauty for my love?" "Is this beauty without a nose ring, the happiness of one crore kisses?" "I felt that way and followed her, and gave her my heart with a wedding proposal" "Rejecting the love she had, she married someone else" "What did you do then?" "I made her fall in love with me with my skills even after she got married" Not bad! "I am her lover and the boy who married her" "Once you had seen her in a sari" "You sent your love through a love letter unable to stop it after seeing it" She never cares how hard you try. "She rudely refused even after being so convinced by the elders." "She changed the heart again in the morning, I like your penance" "He walked into your house holding your finger and sticking his right foot in" Yes. Why did you occupy my bed? Look, there is nothing to be distributed. Everything is ours. This bed is ours, this room is ours, and so is that bathroom! Do not overload driver Santosh - You! - Hey! The bed belongs to me. You take the blanket. That refrigerator belongs to me, you fit with that window. Do you mean to say that you take the comforts of my effort? Good evening. Believe in girls and be punished. Why aren't you ready yet? Father-in-law had called in the morning He says that the mother-in-law is tense. Let's go now. It's our wedding day in a couple of days. You must visit us for sure uncle. Yes! We will call you once we arrive. Start now. You fooled us bad man! Seeing you fight for everything, we thought you were wife and husband, Ok, what is your real relationship? I am the driver and she is my passenger, sir. That's it. Whose idea was this? -She-hers' How did they come to know? I told them. - It was you? - Yes. Why did you do that? I felt that it is not right for us to deceive them when they were so honest. Anyway, we don't have a love story, right? Isn't it just a story? So there are no love stories in your life? Why not? Her name is Kavitha. She was in sixth standard and I was in sixth class. What's that? Aren't they both the same? Didn't you get it? She was studying in English and I was studying in Telugu. But, I didn't know much English those days. I see. But one day I mustered up my guts and said 'I love you' in English. What did she say? She said I love you too. Well, isn't it a hit then? Do not get excited Being basically from the middle Telugu I thought she was in love with two boys. I left feeling why be in a third position. Don't laugh. Do you find my agony funny? Sorry... Didn't you fall in love again? I felt like I shouldn't, but I had to fall after seeing Padma. What did she study? She read the universe. Oh, is she a geography student? No, she works in a copier. I thought that when I failed when I proposed Kavitha orally, I thought of writing a poem to Padma and spending it in love. One day, I went directly to her and handed her my love letter. What did she say? She put the original and the copy in my hands -and she asked me for a rupee. - Wy did she do that? Yes, she felt that I was also a client. Very funny I never laughed so much. Why don't you always smile like that? Maybe I would if a guy like you is by my side I felt that all boys are bad. But there are some good ones like you. Equally... Oh no, they are not mine. Listen to me, I don't use them. Dammit! I never expected you to be such an idiot. Listen to me, I don't need them. For. I thought you were a good guy. What I believed is true. All boys are like you. They just act good. Our eyes deceive us sometimes. It's true, my eyes deceived me showing you well. - Listen to me. - Having. It's not your mouth, but for the car Ma'am... please listen to me once. Madam, once... Dammit! Madam! Do not follow me Tell me friend Why did you put condoms in the car, idiot? Hey, it's a car ride Shouldn't there be some security? Dirty idiot, car safety means a seat belt, stepney, or a first aid kit. Do they give you condoms for that? Don't worry, a lot of people live safe because of that. My life is turning upside down, idiot. You ruined my positive opinion of me in a heartbeat, rascal. Shut up, she leaves me now you see. You ruined everything, idiot! - Throw it away. - Who are you? Santosh Hey. Hold on tight and pull her tight - Come. - Hey! Idiots, wasn't what you had yesterday enough? Hey, hold her tight. You come to our place and hit us? I'm going to teach you a lesson. Drive up to the farm house. Hello friend, she hit me between my legs. You... God! She hit me again dude! Get down! Let me Stop pulling! Leave that girl, idiots. You are just a driver. Do you need to be heroic? Why did you hit me so hard? Can't you wait until it comes to you? rascals! Aren't you afraid of the Nirbhaya act too? Hey! leave my friend I'll push her if you don't. Come on, let it. Hey! Leave my friend, I'll push her now! Santosh I won't leave anyone if she gets hurt. Leave my friend Don't come, I'll push her. Hey. Santosh! I didn't push her. I did not do it! Sruthi! Santosh! Sruthi-Santosh. Hold on tight. Don't panic. You will be safe. Santosh Santosh Hello. My name is Ramya sir. I'm calling you from LIC. We have a new scheme You will get a crore if something happens to you within 5 months 5 months is too much Tell me if something can work in 5 minutes. There is no such offer sir I'll make you a great offer. Make a note. What's up sir? Account number 434846472 Password Nanna143 axis bank account Mr? You will see 5 Lakhs in the account. Transfer everything also your account. Mr! And don't call me again. Don't continue that work too. Thank my Lord! Are you surprised how a taxi driver can have 5 thousand rupees in his account? I am not a driver Oh! What is behind your sudden appearance? How are you friend? What is hapening here? What else? Your dad is looking for matches for you. He will do it, that is his duty. Why do I feel a difference? Have you connected with someone there yet? Should not? That is our duty man. - Do you intend a love marriage? - Yes. Why not love the girl after getting married? Do you eat a frying pan after the meal before? - Do not try to give useless advice. - Oh, you have become wise! They say that love happens sometimes with a single look. But many glances must be invested to win that love. Love at first sight. Be prepared to spend a lifetime with a girl at a glance. It's the same thing that happened in your case. But that love did not last long. You are the driver and I am the temporary owner of this taxi. This relationship is fine to travel 4 hours together with you. You didn't look as beautiful up close as you did from far away. but i liked you again my parents are my gods She believes that everything goes well for us if we pray to God. So, there is nothing wrong in putting aside our beliefs for her, the driver Santosh. This is not love born of attraction, but true love. so without thinking about anything else being a software engineer, I became a taxi driver. The same love pushed me to be a support even in death and not only in life. not only this day but I wish to travel 100 years together But it is not possible Because... ... this branch cannot support the weight of two people. I love you And I miss you. no santoh Santosh Santosh Santosh... Santosh... Santosh... Lady I'm here. Did you think I died? I also thought the same But here, these branches and these twigs saved me That's why they say we should grow trees. They say marriages are made in heaven? I thought even ours would happen there. But, I never expected it to be written here on earth. Hey, be careful, you'll fall if it breaks. Why prevent me from celebrating such a happy moment? Actually, I just found out that it's so good if the universe turns upside down. You've lost it? Don't sway. Tell me you Love Me. I'll stop swinging. Now? Now yes. I will not do it. - Then I'll swing. I love you! Please stop! Say you will marry me. That can't happen. I'll keep swinging if you don't. I can fall then. Swing, it's your wish. I'm swinging. It's your responsibility if I fall. yes swing Who is Sruthi here? It's me, what happened? Are you refusing treatment? She says that she would only receive the treatment if she agrees to the marriage. I'm going. What is your annoyance? I'm sorry any girl would react like you if someone proposed to her directly. First, you should know everything about me. My name is Santosh and my salary is 2 lakhs per month. Even if you spend a lakh, we can handle the house with the rest. Sister, please give him some cotton. Here. I drink a beer a week. I'll stop coming home that day if you don't like it. I smoke a cigarette if I'm too tense I can quit once you marry me. When it comes to the dowry part, I won't take a dime. Because my dad will get the most out of your father that he can. So tell me, do you want to marry me? Do you understand what you are talking about right now? Sister, did I hurt my head by any chance? She says no. Every other part is hurt. They will treat me if you agree to marry me. Think for a couple of minutes and tell me quickly. The poor sister is also getting late I'll go and call the Doctor if you both come to an agreement. I will. Inject this idiot now. "I'm not sure if it's a pain or a pleasure" "I'm floating in such a trance" "Indefinite whether snow or fire" "Such magic has surrounded" "A pleasure that increases the load and a second that reduces distances" "The truth is that it is incredible and this adorable celebration" "Is so big!" "Don't blame your eyes for lack of sleep." "It is my crime to have entered your dreams" "Do not be angry in your heart for the bother" "The mistake of remembering you is mine." "It's good, even if it's a mistake, there are no problems." "There is no thought of escaping from you." Why is that? "Let us put shackles at the feet of time" "I feel the desire to enter your arms" "Let's declare a holiday in this world" "What job do you have between us?" "I am your world and you are mine" "Let's make a garland with our hearts" "And decorate love with it" "I'm not sure if it's a pain or a pleasure" "I'm floating in such a trance" "Indefinite whether snow or fire" "Such magic has surrounded" "A pleasure that increases the load and a second that reduces distances" "The truth is that it is incredible and this adorable celebration" "It's great" He is called Santosh. He introduced me to the happiness that he was absent from me. Don't you always call me in a bad mood? I'm not in a bad mood right now, but I'm very happy. He is the reason. Wow Sister, when will you show me Santosh? Today or tomorrow I will not delay it? One second, I'll call you later. Ok sister, bye. Hello So should we talk to your dad about our marriage? You talk to me first Are all the details you said true? Oh about salary? It is 1.75 lakhs. I rounded it up to 2 thousand rupees when I told you. not the salary Later? Oh, is it the beer? I might have a couple more of them when I'm out with friends. We have these wedding anniversaries and everything. - Not that. - Later? What's your name? Santosh Is it just Santosh? Only Santosh means... It's Santosh Alubilli So why is Santosh Reddy here? Yes. Santosh Reddy is. You know what is my name? It is Sruthi Keerthana Sarma. - So? - Still don't get it? Do not Your caste and my caste are not the same Breed? How is it related to love? You may not see it, but me and my family do. You eat chicken and we eat chickpeas. You eat lamb and we eat pickled cucumber You eat lemon rice and we eat Biryani, so what? I'll stop eating it after marriage if you want. Is it a big deal to give up meat? That's what you would say now and make me cook chicken after marriage. - What about your brain? - Do not. I told you before that I love my parents very much. They did a lot for me. So I'll marry whoever they ask me to marry What if they choose me? They wouldn't even do that in their dreams. Because your caste certificate and mine differ. Hello, I almost died for you! I can thank you for that. thank me? Aren't you alive now? So let it. You loved me too. Both you and I know it. Yes. I loved you too. But I am canceling it immediately. Are there any train or flight tickets to cancel? Is love. You know, love is a matter of brain. So, you can easily remove it It stays in the recycle bin if you delete it I always use shift delete. So what do you say now? I love you if you are in my community. And I will marry you if you are in my caste. That is. I didn't know you would abandon me like this, so I had dreamed up a song in a foreign country. - Why are you sad? - Is nothing. Just think that nothing happened between us. Think that all this is a dream. If you had been born into my caste, I would definitely have married you. But no! This is not my mistake or yours. It is an act of god. Act of god my foot. Ego! Stop. For. Go down. Are you the YES? No, I'm the chief of police. Why? A bailiff? I was scared to think that you are a YES. Shut up Whether it's an SI or a police chief, a cop is a cop. They pay them a salary of 50,000 and 10,000. That is the reason they give us away. Show your license first. That's in the wallet sir teach it - Wallet is missing sir. - Then the RC? You see... you shouldn't ask a lot of things after seeing the car. - So what do I ask? - You can ask us for a lift, sir. We can't give anything more than that. Are you heading to the police station sir? No, to the fire station. Why are you on fire sir? So where do you expect a cop to go than a police station? I didn't mean that sir, I lost my bag. Yes, the bag is missing, your wallet is missing. We have all lost something here. What did you lose sir? my wife left Did she die sir? No, she ran away. Yes! Look to your front. She drives fast. DONGALAPALEM What is her name? Sruti sir. When did you lose the bag? She got lost when her mother called and asked her to be careful with the bag. Shut up. I lost it while having lunch at the hotel sir Yes sir. How does the thief look? He is a boy sir. We can identify it. he is a fair bit -Is he fat? - Yes sir. Do you know him? The gentleman knows him better than I do, since he is his son. How did the son of a policeman become a thief, sir? He is my whole destiny, man. He has been like this since his childhood. He stole his mother's chain when he was in fifth level. He is the reason I became an IQ rank SI. He stole our sir SI's gun and uniform and sold it somewhere. - Mohan, bring that guy. - OK sir. here sir... take your bag lady Is everything there? Yes, it's all there, sister. I'm sorry Dad. I will not do. How many times will you say that, rascal? Wait sir. Why are you degrading me like this? What haven't I done for you? Please sit down sir. Why do you bring bad fame to your father? I don't know what I'm doing sister. I do not understand anything Why would it bring daddy a bad name, sister? I also want to be a good policeman like my father. But, I am stealing what I see without my knowledge. Everything happens without my knowledge. I don't feel sad when dad hits me. But I'm worried because dad's fame is at stake because of me. He talks like this, but he does the same thing again. He has this disease. true sir. Your son really is sick. It's called steal syndrome. People with this disease unknowingly commit robberies and keep running away. You may not believe this, but he is true sir. Your son is not a thief, but a patient gentleman. It's not about whether you hit him or scold him, sir. If he gets checked out by a good shrink and shows some love at home, your kid will definitely become a police lord. Yes sir. What he says is true. Please try it once. - What is your name dear? -Vijay. Why do you feel sad dear? You are not a thief. But a future policeman. You have to catch the thieves in the future. Yes son, it's you. Smile. That's good Thank my Lord Who marries you is a very lucky girl. Why not you than someone else? It is in those moments that I feel... ... it would have been better if you had been born into our caste But it's your bad luck. You don't need to feel so bad. There are so many cousins ​​to marry me. It is? Who are they? Keerthy Reddy, Swathi Reddy, Snehalatha Reddy and there are many more Reddys. It's better if you think of yourself It is better to think of yourself. Trinadh Sarma, Viswanath Sarma, Ravi Sarma, Murali Sarma Oh! Are Rohit Sarma and Ishant Sarma your cousins ​​too? Shut up. oh no, rain Roll up the glass! Hey! It's raining. Yes, what is your problem? Not only is it outside, but it's also raining on me. Damn, I don't even have time to feel relieved. Tell me friend Hey, it's raining mate Why do you call me by all friend? Go sit in the car. You... It's raining in the car, man. Since it's a rainy season, I forgot to do the punctures for the top. People fix tire punctures, but what about this top, idiot? Hey, instead of showing the skits in my car, stick the posters that are in the car Where did you put them? Look, they will be at the reception Dammit What happened Why did you leave me and come here? You couldn't stay when I left you for two minutes for no reason. How would I feel if you wanted to break up giving a reason an hour after proposing love? Not some reason, but that's the reason. Reasons must unite people. Do not split them. If that's the reason, I'll talk to your parents and convince them. Didn't I say that won't happen? They give more importance to prestige than to love. So why did you say you love me? I said it with the fear that something might happen to you. For a girl he meets one day, you decided to die without thinking about your parents who raised you for 25 years This is not called love but madness. I said it, since otherwise you can do something else in that madness. What did you say? Did you say I couldn't stay even two minutes when you left? Stay here as long as you want. "Is it possible that only the heart loves and forgets?" "The time to forget and die is the same now, my love" "How can I bear this burning pain?" "Don't mercilessly drive me away" "You should forgive me since I have no other way out" "Let me be yours if I have another birth" "Is it possible that only the heart loves and forgets?" Will you stop it right for a minute? - I can drop to the house. - No thanks. "You showed a lie like a mirror" "I can't change your way by telling the truth" "The heart is breaking into countless pieces" "Burning time has come out breaking wings" "You're running away blaming time" "Is it possible that only the heart loves and forgets?" Hello Superman! Uncle, what did you bring for me? - Give me a hug first and I'll tell you. - OK. What I brought for you is... - A racing car! - Wow! Hey, go out and play without disturbing the uncle Okay! You leave, just and you come. You can have food. Okay, sister. Are you okay son? I'm fine mom. Your matches are the day after. The girl is none other than my friend's daughter. She is well educated and is from a highly valued family in the village. She recently met me after 10 years and asked how her son is doing. I said some nice words about you and showed your photo on my android phone She immediately she took my hand and she asked me to marry her daughter to my son. Do not rejoice! The reason for his reaction is not because he liked your photo. But how he liked my customs, my discipline and the value I have in society. Don't they ask you to verify the company before you buy the product? This is what. I said let's go straight for engagement. But they followed these formalities and organized the matches. Shouldn't I like his mother? This marriage will take place whether you like it or not. Because it is not only your dad who gave the word, but it is Alubilli Dorababu I married your mother who likes? I got married like my dad told me. Aren't we happy now? You must listen to the elders, eat what they give and marry the girl they select. That is why they are called elders! The elderly are not those who are very old and super tall. It's about value. It's about their value. Get in now. Your mom stopped eating since yesterday because of you. It's fine if she stops him, but he has stopped giving food even to me. "What celebration is it for you after I walked away?" "It is I who is sacrificed together with you" "Is it poison or a blessing, do you know the name of our love?" "Fate must be left as a pain in the future" "It's not destiny, but it's you who changed it" "Is it possible that only the heart loves and forgets?" "The time to forget and die is the same now, my love" "How can I bear this burning pain?" "Don't mercilessly drive me away" "You should forgive me since I have no other way out" "Let me be yours if I have another birth." What dear, have you sisters started chatting so fast? How is America dear? Are they saying that Trump is screwing it up once he hs elected? None of that, dad, it's fine. Than? Do you seem to be sweating? Have it. Why are you looking at me with a blank face? - Turn on the fan. - Oh no. Is it your father who will increase the speed? Don't let your love overflow on your daughter. If she's not into my daughter, do you want me to bathe him in a puppy? Don't say meaningless things. Let me get to the point directly. Are you in love with someone? Don't be afraid. Isn't our marriage loving too? not dad Mr. Nippu Raju's daughter is so sincere! Hey. She stops exaggerating and get out. Her phone was never busy, the words never wavered. All these traits showed that you are not in love. That's why I saw a match for you without your consent. What are you looking at me with your eyes wide open? Get the photo of the child. The boy is the son of my childhood friend. He has an education similar to yours. When asked why he didn't go to America, she replied that the tax paid by him should be useful for the development of India I thought that was significant. A man who respects India respects even his wife, his darling. Here... If you take a look at the photo and tell us your opinion ... What does this expression mean? Dad, I don't want to get married soon. I want to stay with you for a few days. What are you talking about? Dad has a great match for you, you know? Go take a shower, meanwhile I'll talk to her. What is there to talk about? She is not saying that she doesn't want to get married. She says not now. If a daughter shares everything openly with her father, it shows that she is right. If we don't take them easy since they are children and we understand them It means that we are a right as their parents. Did you understand or should I tell you another way? I don't have it! Don't rush darling, be happy with us as long as you want. Since he is my friend, I will somehow make him understand. - Thanks Dad. - Well. - Uncle, I have a question. - Than? What do I want to tell you, uncle? Why do you have that doubt? Vinny said 'I love you' yesterday in class. Hey, your position is better than me. What exactly is this I love you, man? You won't understand even if I say it now. Even my teacher said the same thing when I asked. Is it harder to say 'I love you' than math, man? It is very difficult, you go and play. Uncle, did you see a picture of aunt? - No, I did not do it. - Wait, let me bring it. Sir, this bag was in the car. - Hello. - Hi Sruthi, it's me Santosh. This is his sister speaking, wait a minute. Sister! Santosh is on the line. Uncle. See photo of the aunt. Sister bring it one time - Uncle, see it once. - Wait. See the photo of the aunt. Sister, come and take this guy. Tinku, uncle will see her directly tomorrow. Come. - Hi how are you? - I'm fine. How did you get my number? You forgot your bag in the car. I checked your diary and I'll call you. Where should I take the bag? Can you find me at our village lake? Well. Is there anything else to say? Any - Ok, I'll come in an hour. - OK. One second, we'll call you later. Ok sister, bye. Hi Uncle. Who is on the phone? Uncle, I'm Santosh's friend. Are you just a friend or a girlfriend? Uncle? Tell me dear. Shouldn't you say it at some point? This is a good season and a wedding season. What could be a better time for this? actually dude... I don't like to scold dear. Come to the point directly. Man, I like Santosh. He also liked me a lot. Oh, so love is in the peaks. - Uncle ... - Look dear, I don't need your name or any other details. You should forget it. Not only from your heart, You should also erase it from your mind. That's because your marriage is already established. I have given my word to someone. Even if you say you'd bring me millions of dowries I can't get my word back. that's my worth Don't you have a father too? I mean the man who raised you for 25 years. Whether out of respect for you or trust in their education has left you like a free bird without security But here you are saying that you are a girl talking as you want and giving all the flowers you can My son smiles showing all his teeth like posing for a toothpaste commercial. You fell in love with him. It's good that you fell in love with him. You won't stop there and take it to your father at wind speed and introduce him as your fiancée and the son-in-law of the house. With those words, both the value you have at home and the value that your father has in his town would be lost. Also, as an added bonus I will end up losing my courage in my town. It's no big deal if I lose my courage. But I will end up losing my life with it. Because I don't live for oxygen, but for the value I have in the town. Not just MBBS doctors girls like you can save our lives sometimes. Think about it. You would value me if you value your father. I know you love me But I don't know if you're lying to me. Many of us tell lies. A friend tells another friend that he is near a dad tells his daughter that he will get it tomorrow The husband tells his wife that she is very beautiful. Everyone lies. You know why? So that they would not give pain to their loved ones. But you lied to make me feel sad. What is that lie? Your name is a lie. What else? The name you said is never a problem for our marriage. I don't understand what your problem is. i need the answer Bag. Sometimes even lifeless objects try to unite Sruthi people. I like this bag. But it is we who do not understand. Santosh, can you leave me? Enters Who is this boy? My husband. This is my home. OK Bye Uncle, have you known aunt for a long time? You call everyone aunt. - Uncle. - Yes. Why do they make boys and girls sit separately in class? Because otherwise they may learn Physics and Chemistry along with Mathematics at the wrong age. What is a marriage uncle? Two people distant from each other traveling together So are we both married now uncle? Man, I need to go to the bathroom. For the car. Hey, it's late, wait. The car would go into disrepair if I do it, man. It's my bad destiny. What are you watching? Do it fast Who will unpack me? You don't even know how to unzip, who proposed their love to you? vinny Go now. To run! If we leave him in Pakistan, he'll finish it with just two farts. It's done? Not yet. Do it fast. Oh God! Did movie actors make it to the bathroom too? Not just movie actors, but your grandfather, your dad and everyone does it. Do it fast I'm done man. Wait, I'm coming. To be. What is this smelly idiot? Uncle, I have a question. What's that? Aren't there many nights in childhood? So what is a first night? Hey, you sleep. Close your eyes. Sister-in-law... - How are you Ramana? - I'm fine. - How are Lakshmi and the children? - Everything is fine Is the brother not at home? He is up. I will call him Husband! Brother What Ramana, what is the problem? Brother, we are moving to a new house, right? We are doing the Satyanarayana Vratha. You and your sister in law must come safely We will come safely. Look dear, bring coffee for uncle - Ok daddy - Ok. Ok, how many children do you have? A son by the grace of God, brother. What is the grace of God? It's all your hard work and dedication I'll go crazy if you say it's the grace of the gods that you became a father Ok, how are you taking care of your son? I'm taking care of him like a friend, brother Why? Is it to be his beer friend or to help him in his love affairs? I will slap you if you say things as a friend. A son should be treated like a son. Here it comes at the right time. He is my son You would have seen it a long time ago. He is like that in modern times. He is Ramana, a distant relative of ours. He is an uncle to you in relation - Hi Uncle. - Hello. Do you know how I raised him in Ramana? If I show five of my fingers If I show them like this and say it's four, it's four for him. Look, if I show him a bitter gourd and say it's a bottle gourd, he's done. Likewise, another thing is... What is the use of this theme now dear? - You come in son - Wait a minute. I'm talking about him. Why do you ask him to leave? See we got this courage when we raised it like this If the people in your household value it, society would give it 10 times the value. - Look, how you raise a son is Ramana ... - Brother When a father calls, he should be in a cold sweat even if it's not summer He should shiver even if it's not winter and soak even if it's not rainy season Only then will we have that kind of value throughout our lives. You are right brother. I'll say goodbye brother. They give birth without knowing how to raise them. what happened son It's nothing mom. Is it about what your dad said? How's it going with him mom? What did he say mom? He didn't marry you the way you liked? But why did his father ask him? How could he even talk like that? Will he lose his worth if I don't marry the girl he shows me? So is it okay if things go wrong with my living mother? When you let me play on your chest as a kid, do you feel like you can kick me here now? Or does he feel that I will not know the pain of his blow since this is the body he has given? Why are parents needed to raise and support children? Don't we have hostels? But the maids cannot understand the pain in the children's eyes. Only moms would. The guardians only know how to hit children when they go wrong. But isn't he a father who teaches what is right and what is wrong? But why is it losing its value in my eyes by running after values? When I didn't like school, she joined me when she was five... ... she changed it right away Why doesn't she understand when I tell her I don't like the girl she chose now that I'm 25? I remember it well When he was a kid when I said 'mom' when I just started talking, he taught me how to say 'dad'. Now, when there is a need to speak up and I do, do you consider it speaking against you? I don't understand if it was him or me who changed mom. It is he who changed his son. I used to think about you for an hour when you were a child Now, he is only thinking about you all day. Thinking about me all the time, you forgot to think about him altogether, mom. Do you know what his BP or sugar levels are? He does not know it. Ask him about the grades I got on my 10th standard, you can't go wrong. He has done more than a father should do for his son. I saw love in his anger and responsibility in his discipline. He can feel that he is a villain to me. But he is my role model and he is my hero. The value he always wants may or may not exist tomorrow. But a son will never lose the value that he gives to his father. Knowingly or unknowingly, he loved a mother mother. She left me without saying what the reason was. Anyway, I can't marry the girl I like. At least he feels happy if I marry the girl he selected Tell dad I'm marrying the girl who selected mom. I'm in a madness since I began to understand the world, It's called 'value'. Status and prestige are synonymous with that. Is the same? Yes. It's a disease, friend. Not only me... but many people who have about 40 acres of land and keeping about 50 lakhs in banks will have this madness. The symptoms of that are like banging his head thinking about prestige all day and thinking what our villagers think of us. Me this way, without our knowledge the villains of our movies get involved. And to cure that disease no medicine in homeopathy, allopathy, etc. can help you. The reason is that he considers himself a monarch seeing his prestige. To whatever hospital you take him, they will not have patience or procedure to cure this patient Why do you say things that don't make sense? There is a meaning friend. Why will I talk nonsense? Many parents in our generation are like me. We joined our son in the corporate college hostel to please our relatives and neighbors. He calls once a week and cries that he can't stay there and would study at home. We can't hear those screams. This is because we fear that our value will decrease if he studies being at home. We got a party from America for the daughters and we married them for prestige. When she comes once every three or four years for a festival, when we ask her if she is okay, she smiles and walks in We won't know there's a pain behind that smile and what daughters need is not America or Australia but parental love. We just think that they are welcoming, but we never think about whether they are happy or not. Now, I lost that craziness, man. She left. I made my son suffer a lot all these days for the name of courage. I even made him lose the girl he loved. I want to correct that error now. What are you saying? I mean I want to marry my son to the girl he loves. I understand what you meant. Aren't you asking me to find another mate for my daughter? My daughter told me a long time ago that she doesn't want to get married now. She was afraid that if she told you, you would talk nonsense thinking about your worth. But you said it yourself. Dude, we met after 10 years and you never came to my house. You have to come to my house now. Even if a person has a value or not, I shouldn't visit anyone's house just like that. There should be a time and an occasion for everything. Be precise friend. I will go with my son and daughter-in-law to his daughter's wedding. Well? Thanks friend Son - Dad. What did you bring for me, son? - Dad. I mean, you brought gifts for everyone. I just wanted to know what you have for me. One minute dad. Son. Is this the one? Forgive me son. I couldn't understand you. Boys your age want to run. People my age want to walk slowly. But to make you walk with me too... ...I didn't know it wasn't right, son. I didn't know that a father should only think about his son until he is 25 years old. and from then on, the son will think of the father. Dad. I'm just a guy in farming so my dumb brain didn't get it. Don't say that dad. I used to brag about showing all five fingers and saying you would accept them as four but I did not understand that I was leading you to a wrong path. I have made another big mistake along with these. Man, I like Santosh. He also liked me a lot. look dear I don't need your name or any other details. you should forget it That's because his marriage is already established. I don't live for oxygen, but for the value I have in the town. Think about it. You would value me if you value your father. Even when I apologize or you forgive me... ... the mistake I made will not cease to exist. To correct it, I should unite the two whom I separated. Dad, it's late now, we're going there tomorrow. If you want to harvest a winter crop in summer, it's the grass you get. Therefore, we have to finish the tasks on time. Are you sure the girl likes you? - She does dad. - So go ahead! What is the delay? -Dad, I don't know anything about her dad. - Yes son! It would end in disaster if he is also like me. - Let's do something? - Shall we go back? We'll make her run away with you. - Dad! - Follow. You are talking? I am not only your father from today, I am also your friend. Come on, you drive first. - Will something go wrong dad? - I'm here son, don't worry. - Is it his house? - Yes Dad. - Dad. - Yes. He just thinks one more time. Somehow I feel like this isn't right we will do something My friend has daughters. We will call you and give you advice. That's the best. - Hello. - Hey! Why did you call me in the middle of the night nonsense? Didn't I say the wedding is off for the night? I didn't call you to talk about the type of wedding. I called to talk about my son's love. If you want to talk about it, call the girl's father. I do not. I felt that you could give some advice to be the father of the girls. - Than? - The question is... My son loved a girl on Friday morning. Is he not in his youth? That girl loved him on Saturday morning too. Isn't she young too? But I separated them both on Saturday afternoon. Am I not getting old? So why did you call me at midnight on Sunday? Because now we are in front of your house I ask you to run away with her. My son says no. What do you say? Does it make any sense? Do not get tired. I ask you, since you have also married lovingly. Of course yes! You better meet the girl first find out about her father and then proceed. Fine, we'll do what you say. Dad! Hey They were there. How do we find the girls' room now? I'll tell you. The room where the light shines is where the girl is. A light ... Yes friend, how did you know? When they are in love, they keep thinking about her lover with the lights on. Haven't you slept yet dear? not dad - Turn off the light and sleep soon. - Well. Good evening. Good evening. Tell me. Even Veerabrahmendra Swamy, who predicted the future, can't say that accurately, my friend. Ok, stop praising me and get to homework. Well. Come on son! - You go up first. - Watch out dad! Oh no, why are you here right now? Yes, my dad came too. Is your dad here too? Do not tense, now he is changed. Yes dear, I have changed. Since both of you are separated because of me, I have come to unite you again. What friend - Did you come in? - Yeah, he just walked in. Where are you then? I'm out of the room It's better, you hide behind the fridge. Otherwise, they'll catch you if their father comes. If that's true! Wait... Hey who is Stop there! How dare you rob my house? Oh no, I'm not a thief sir. - I'm a man with good value in the village. - Worth! Turn around! - You? - It's you? Why are you here friend? So, do you even have a second fling? Hey, don't talk without a meaning. I only have one affair... Damn, only one wife. Was I advising you to take my own daughter? Damn. That means the girl your son loved on Friday morning... She is your daughter The boy my daughter loved on Saturday morning... He is my son So the couple you broke up on Saturday afternoon... They are your daughter and my son. Then the marriage we canceled on Sunday night... Your daughter's marriage to my son. So the ones in that room are my son and his daughter? your daughter and my son Oh no, I think my father is trapped. I haven't shown your daughter's photo to my son. My daughter didn't see it when I showed it to her. Hey, how dare you bring my daughter to my house? I can't get your daughter out of the neighbor's house, right? So we had to do it. Stop, dad. Lord, everything has happened thanks to him. Even when I stopped him, he brought me saying that he is not only a father but also a friend. Added to this is a roguish friend who gave advice like a lover boy. Who is that dirty rascal? Hey, you don't talk when you don't know the meaning. You will go blind. Why do you talk like I'm cursing you? Sir, I like Sruthi very much. - How much? - As much as I like paper candy. Stop dad. Please don't pay attention to his words, sir. Your daughter will be happy only with me Please let her marry me, sir. I will not do it I will never do that. I'll marry her off to her son. Do what you can. One minute. The watch given by your grandfather. Thank you. - Are you tense? - Yes. Get up once. Get up. I mean, if we hug eight times a day, Oxytocin levels increase and it seems that we will not have tension. - I shall? - OK. Do you feel better? Yes a little bit. How will we name the children that will be born to us? They will take names they like after they grow up. Until then, we'll call them Cherry and Berry. I am planning to send our son to the army if we have one. Can... ..but I doubt if they take him or not if he is born with your height. You... Uncle, I have a question. Brother, you haven't seen my son today. He is obeying what I say. I'm raising him exactly like you told me. Check? When I said that? You did it then! Ramana, the way we should raise a child is... when he asks us to take him to Koti, you should take him to Ooty When he asks you for chicken, you should bring him lamb. Did you understand? So ultimately you say we should never give him what he asks for. It is not like this? I will give you a hard slap. We should give them more than they ask for. Only then will a father have the value of him. - Ok, I'll have some water and I'll go. - Go ahead.
