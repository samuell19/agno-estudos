We can still get rid of these vultures. Tracy, arm the cannons! Tracy! Tracy? Tracy... What's wrong, dear? Damn it. God damn it! The fucking machine isnt responding. Calm down, its not her fault. We didnt bust our asses for two weeks to get ripped off. I'm going out. Bad idea. I can't cover you without Tracy. Let me check, I can fix it. Vascan! Dont! Now, fix it. Tracy must have been malfunctioning when she analyzed the air. Trouble breathing? Smells like a rotting corpse... Lovely. It reminds me of Tracy's cooking. I hope she's not listening. Hey, guess what kind of scavengers these are? What kind? Women. This wreck belongs to me! Stay back! Stay back! Hey! Good girl She's between life and death. I destroyed her propulsion system. Her flying days are over. Murderer! She is a living being. You've got to be kidding me. We can still heal her. Not anymore! Easy, tiger! You'll make it harder for our technicians. We need to pump your ship. Back away. Now! I warned you. Im sorry to dis... Tell them to get off our ship... Now! Cover me! Piece of shit! All right! Let's do this old school. Bad idea! Stop! You could! Lago! What's going on? My heart? Give yourself a jolt.. You don't even respect your own ship! Bulk! Tracy! Why can't you understand that we're here to do good? By destroying one ship to fix another? That doesn't make any sense. Why is a fridge better than a toaster? Its just a drip-feed. No big deal. Tracy, don't give up on me. A little effort, my dear. Wicked creatures! Weve lost her. Please, hey. Everything can be fixed... What if I blow your head off? Can you fix that? Her death was too brutal. Prepare the ceremony, we've lost enough time. Am I the only one seeing a naked girl in the sky? Just checking. Commander Galdor's ship has just entered the atmosphere. Tracy? He'll be approaching in a few seconds. Bulk! Run! Corey, we have to go. Corey! We have to go! Lago, are you in trouble? Our scanners picked up a powerful magnetic field on the planet's surface. I think we might just have witnessed a miracle. What are you talking about? Pull yourself together Lago! Where is Vascan? Lago? Where is Vascan? You could replace our androids. Our AI does her best but she has trouble making them... ...sexy. God, I missed that! I've been fucking machines for so long I'm starting to smell like them. You'll like it. Lago! Track the girl that escaped the wreck. She might lead us to the source of all this. The Comity is on edge, I need to give them results. I've heard enough! Vascan, tell me you will make more sense than your partner. Please reass... - How's your heart? - Don't worry about me, I've got a heart of steel. Vascan! What game are you playing? We encountered some scavengers, Commander. We took care of them. Bring us back the Mima, quickly. Now, your prey is mine! The machine rebellion may have been provoked by a foreign intelligence, not a sudden desire for freedom. Oh really?! And where does this new information come from? It's difficult to explain, sir. We will know more after analyzing its log. We have a lead. Lago and I are on it. Bring us back the Mima or you and Lago will be in big trouble. Negative, sir! We're running out of time. My patience is wearing thin. Vascan! Tracy? You're still with us? Still recovering from our wild night? All good, Captain. We are entering the same type of force field that we encountered on Apus-7. We're getting there. It's like a huge cemetery. You mean a vast dump. I've never seen so many wrecks. Maybe they had souls, too. Souls? A man my age holds certain beliefs. I guess you have the right. But as far as I'm concerned, all we have here is a parasite with pretty legs. The entity just vanished into the largest wreck. What the fuck is that thing? It's keeping all the other wrecks in orbit. There's definitely some kind of intelligence behind this thing. - Are you surprised? - Shut it, oilsucker. Where are we? Leave her alone. We'll figure it out. Tracy, can you land on this thing? The wreck is worn and fragile. Let's do this old school. - I can manage a soft landing. - I'll do it! May I advise you to slow down, Captain. Slow down! Vascan! Tracy, anything broken? Some minor damage to the landing thrusters. I will quickly recover. Good job, Captain. Oilsucker? Did you see how gentle I can be? Oh, yes. Tracy barely felt a thing. You and I are gonna take a little walk. Trace! Be careful captain! The air seems breathable. But the force fields can falsify the results. Take off your mask. Come on! Good... Like last time, you're reacting to the methanethiol in the atmosphere. Why didn't you warn me? I had to repeat the experience to validate the hypothesis. Hypothesis confirmed. Just tell me where to go. The signal is getting stronger. Be careful! What's so funny? Reinitiate scan! Tracy? Again? Shut up! What the fuck? Lago! Do you read me? Lago! What... Who is in charge here? Talk! Or I'll blow those pretty legs clean off! You said it's been a long time since you were with a real woman. With a woman, yes. Maybe you've forgotten how to treat us. Be gentle with me, Captain. All right. Not like that. God damn it! I'm a mechanic! Tracy, if you can hear me, unlock the elevator. Please, Tracy! All right, you leave me no choice. You've never raised your hand to me. Tracy, unlock the system immediately! I prefer you stay here for your own good. Tracy, is your system corrupted? Far from it. I've never felt better. Really? Lago, what are you doing? Stop it, you're wasting your time. You won't save Vascan that way. At least he won't die for nothing. Lago, Vascan is back inside Mima. Happy to see you again, captain. My god! Vascan! You better have good news for me! Lago is dead. We tracked the entity to a junkyard in the Coalsack. It's controlling our machines with some kind of new technology. I tried to take it out, but its force fields are too strong for the Tracy. We need your ship's firepower. Impossible. I can't engage without the general staff's approval. We don't have time for that. If the entity escapes again, we won't be able to track it. Tracy is transmitting the coordinates as we speak. You are acting strangely. How do I know you haven't been compromised by the entity? I have been compromised, Commander. I escaped, but any second now it's going to take control of my mind again. Come quickly. Vascan! Don't! Tracy, stay alert! We need you to support our attack! Tracy, can you hear me? Obey!
