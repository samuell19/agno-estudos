ZERO TOLERANCE On Christmas Eve we want the genuine Christmas spirit. - Hello! - Close the door! Hi! Hello! - Merry Christmas. - Hi. And then the whole tribe screwed his ass! Another cup? Hello. Ain't people going home? It's Christmas Eve! I'm home. - What are you dying for...? - It depends what you've got to offer! Christmas candies. - Nuts? - Plum cake. - Ham? - Sausage. - You've got that? Not the small ones! - No, no. - Dip in the pot? - Dip in the pot. Okay. - Where are you off to? - A long lunch. - Christmas buffet? - Dip in the pot, right? - Merry Christmas to all of you! - Merry Christmas! Poor child, forced to work even on Christmas Eve! One has to do one's duty, you see, mom. Said Karl-Bert“. A job well done gives such satis- faction and lays the basis for society. Karl-Bertil's loving mother looked, touched and proud, at her boy. My little boy... Karl-Bertil went down to the hall where the sack was- - dragged it into his father's library and emptied it on the floor. I wish you an extremely Merry Christmas, my well-behaved son. Shit! What a disappointment! You could have fixed something. There ain't that many Christmas Eves in a lifetime. So we talked about food, then? I misunderstood. Don't you ever want to end this? What? "What?" This. No. Can't you go and get something to eat? A Christmas buffet... Merry Christmas! - The Police Commander Center. - Detective Johan Falk speaking. 17-37, assault in the jeweler’s shop opposite Burger King on The Avenue. - Wait for assistance. - Too late, one guy down! I'm going in. Police! Freeze! A Grey Mercedes 380 SE is heading north, along East Harbor Street. There's a... What? North! There's a dead guy in the jeweler’s shop. There's a car chase along The Avenue, East Harbor Street. A suspect of armed robbery, driving north... Watch out! - What do you want me to do, dad? - Wave your hands! Right or left? Turn left! No, shit! Dad! Dad! Dad! Police. Stop, or I'll shoot! - Mom! - No, don't touch her! Drop the gun! Drop it! I'm a police officer! Get out of here! - Nobody moves! - Get the hell out of here! - She's my daughter! - Nobody moves! Drop the gun! Nobody moves! I'll kill the girl! Calm down! Now calm down! - Put a bullet in that motherfucker! - Mom! Drop the knife! Drop it! No! Dad! Dad! Take care of Santa! - Move over... - What happened? - Falk, what the hell happened? - It was two guys. I had to fire at him - the other one... disappeared. - Did he shoot Santa Claus? - Hell no, it was the other guy. He fired three shots at me - and missed! - You've got his description? - No, I didn't see his face. A black leather coat, dark trousers. Those three persons saw his face. Okay, wait here. The policeman started shooting. In the air, of course. But the two guys... - I don't want to get involved. - You're already involved. He was blond. Short hair. Tall, he was rather tall. I don't know... I think I've seen him before, but I don't know where. A Christmas present? I've got almost the same doll. - He came from behind and I... - At home, in the attic... Dark - elegant, too... I've got a whole box filled with dolls. And other toys. with a knife in his hand... Mom, is he a policeman? Johan Falk, sergeant at the City police. Helén Andersson. Well, I'm sorry that you and your daughter got involved in this. It's... Okay, let's go. Yes! Let's go home! Not yet. we” look at some pictures at the police headquarters first. That's him. - Are you quite sure? - Yes, that's him. It's Leo Gaut. - Okay, that'll be all. A ride home? - Yes, please. - All three of them picked Gaut. - Hell, yeah, they did! Let's get started! - Are these extracts from all registers? - Yes. Those of you who don't know him, he hasn't come up for a long time- - check the archives, because you won't find much in his criminal record. Be careful! Gaut is surrounded by heavy criminals and he's got contacts all over town. The addresses we've got on him are written on... page seven. - Is there anything he hasn't done? - Been imprisoned. He's been at trial a few times - never convicted... Apart from a few car thefts at the age of 18, an assault at the age of 19. Both times probation order... But that was in the seventies - after that nothing... He learned how to avoid sanction... Now we'll take him for complicity in crime- - and an attempt on that Santa Claus's life. Well, I'm sorry but the hospital called and said that... Svensson, Per-Olaf, died 30 minutes ago. So, now it's murder. I see. Who was the guy that I shot. Aron Dimitrijevic. A Russian, one of Gauts latest supporters. The Grey Mercedes is registered on Gaut's wife. Well, that's it then. We'll put him away for life. Johan, go home and take it easy. The shock might come after a while. We've got the report on your behavior. It was good, just right! You acted correctly! But how you're feeling now, that's another story... Go home and try to sleep. CRISIS THERAPY - HEALTH SERVICE Hello? - I-II. +II, how in you? Have you taken him yet? No, we keep surveillance of his restaurant and his apartment- - and of some other places in town he usually goes to. You're lucky! You don't have to freeze to death! You can't sleep, or what? - No, I'm in the attic. - Yeah? - What are you doing there? - Nothing. So, you're not getting back into bed, then? If you want me to, I'll come by later to... have a chat. No... No, no, I just wanted to be sure you'll take that motherfucker. Okay. There's a nation-wide alert for him now, so... Okay, I repeat. "13 Public Road, Helén Andersson." "16 B Gallery Street, Chen Li." Chen I., is that his name? Okay. "52 Nordheim Street, Edvin Josefsson." Is that correct? And there were only three witnesses? You're sure? It's fucking important! Okay, good. Okay, thanks, bye. - What next? - Let's go! - Okay, where does the first one live? - Public Road, straight ahead. - What the hell happened? - Aron is dead, killed by a cop. It was this close that the fucker took me out, too. We heard the owner of the jeweler’s shop was murdered with robbery. No, hell, no. It was like this... Thorsen, the owner of the shop... He had received the VAT from our latest gold deal together. Aron was there to get our share. But Thorsen had spent all the money. He had fooled us. A fucking idiot! Yeah, so Aron went crazy, maybe he was stoned or something - as usual... He took out a knife- - stabbed Thorsen, and took plenty of jewels to make it look like a robbery. How much was it? Gold, or... It was about half a kilo, but I had to get rid of it, you know. Here's the stuff. This is Public Road. What number? Thirteen. Nina and Helén lives here Merry Christmas Helén... Mom, hi! We saw something awful today, Nina and I. Maybe a girl from the office- - but nobody will come over on Christmas Eve. Yes. Have a nice time on the islands. Bye. - Is it too hot? - No. - Can't you sleep with me tonight? - May I? - We'll keep each other company. - Okay. Mom, what do you think of Johan? - Who? - The policeman. He seems kind. - Do you think he's got a girlfriend? - I'm sure of that. - Hello. - I-II. +II, how in you? - You're being naughty again? - Watch out! - How are you feeling today? - I'm alright. I don't believe you. Shall we go on with this? Go on with what? You'd better get a new chick from now on. - Listen... - Hi, Britta. Hello. She'd be willing to help you, if you want some New Year sex as well. I'm sure she'd appreciate it. What do you say? You're so fucking rotten! - Hey, why not? - Thanks. I'm sure she's seen quite a lot! - We've arrested him. - Leo?! - Early this morning, in his home. - Why didn't you say so? Has he confessed? Go in and listen. Sellberg and Peter are questioning him. How do you explain that it was your car? He had borrowed it. I didn't know what he was planning to do. When did you put that suit on? Yesterday. When? Some time between Donald Duck and Karl-Bertil Jonsson. Who can confirm that? - My wife, my friends. - Those who gave you an alibi? We spent Christmas Eve together. Ask them. We did. Then you know... - When will I get the car back? - They're here. Now you're thru with my client, right? No. - Are you quite sure? - Yes, I am. Thanks, you'll be hearing from us. Take all the time you need. Turn to the right. - No, he isn't there. - Now turn left. - No? Look at number four! Imagine him in dark clothes, in a leather coat. I can understand you want to find the perpetrator, but stick to the rules. Look again! In a line-up the witness is influenced only by his or her own judgement. It's the same constitution, hair color - the eyes... But that's not him! Yesterday you were quite sure about it. Yes, but there was all this stress yesterday. It's not him. He's not there. May I leave, or...? Bring in the next witness. Well, it's simple. Since no witness picked Gaut, I can't hold him any longer. Use the rules - retain the witnesses until they tell the truth... - You're always so fucking pushy. - That's bullshit! Be more of a psychologist and less of a commando. - They've been threatened. - They are nervous. - They're telling lies by the dozen! - It can't possibly be so... that Leo managed to get the three witnesses' addresses... and then had the time to threaten all three of them in six, seven hours. Unless he was informed. And he could only get that information from this house. Get something that'll hold in court. And I'll be more than happy to deprive that man of his liberty. We won't get any further with the witnesses - not now... What we can do... is to examine in detail Leo Gaut's doings yesterday. Meticulously! His alibi isn't stronger than the faintest link. If we could just find that fucking link we'd be back on the track again. Is the Child Jesus all alone? I was thinking... This is for you, Nina. I wanted to give you a new doll. Oh, Nina... - What do you say, Nina? - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. - No, what do you say? - Thanks. But they're brand new! Why have you kept them? A cabbage patch doll! I remember. They came in the eighties. So you remember that? Yes, you're a great observer. At least twelve years old faces... It's a pity we didn't get the right man. You'd have identified him, it'd be over. Nina, go up to your room and play with your dolls a bit. Up we go... Now he's out there, committing other crimes, and never getting caught. If only one witness picks him he” get a lifetime sentence. Do you want me to lie? To pick an innocent man? No. You get 8 years for perjury - 8 years without your family, your children... I'm sorry. You destroy for others, if you don't speak the truth. I can't help you. I see. After you'd identified him on the photo, we drove you home. Did he threaten you here? Did he break in? Was he alone? Did he just call you? - Come on! You've got no courage? - No one has threatened me! You're a lousy liar. Did he break in? What did he do? - It's not true. - So you're a good liar? I'm not lying! What did he do to get you to risk your freedom? Sweetheart... - Mom! I want you to leave now. You're frightening Nina. - She's not frightened of me. - We can't help you. Mom, look! POLICE HERO SAVED A CHILD Who is the other killer? - Dad! - No, wait! Dad is doing business now and wants to be alone. Hey... What do you want? 1st Prize - District Championship 1996 The Western Swedish Shooting Club Do you want something to drink? Can I help you with anything? The man that you shot in the back, Per-Olaf Svensson... He died. A little boy has lost his father. How does that feel? Maybe I should call my lawyer, or...? Why? You want to support the boy? No, but my lawyer could explain to you- - that there's something called trespassing. Since when do you respect the privacy of the home? We both know what you've done. You're a good shot. How could you miss me in the alley? When you had the chance! Tell me! - Were you nervous? - I've heard that... it was a policeman who started to shoot. Who caused it all. It was you, wasn't it? I know your kind. What you can do. But you don't know me. Pretty girl! Yes. I want you to know that... If I can't arrest you for the murders in the jeweler’s shop and in the alley- - and for the threats against the witnesses- - I'll arrest you for fucking anything! Trust me... I've got so many ways to get you. Hello? - You know who this is, right? - Yes.. I've checked on him now - sergeant Falk... So I'm expecting 5000 from you tomorrow. So the racecourse is open tomorrow? I'm serious. This is getting tiresome. They've understood that you've got an informer here, so listen to me... Johan Falk - no relatives, no girlfriend. He was engaged at the age of 19, but... she's out of the picture. Your colleague seems to be a real pain in the ass. Fröyd, make a list of what we've got on the assault at the gym in Vasastan. Helm, you'll interrogate the Kurdish family - about the fire in their cellar. An interpreter will be here at nine. The others, you know what to do. - Falk, you come with me. Close the door! - I've got a few questions. - Yes? Did you pay Leo Gaut a visit at home yesterday? - Did you or didn't you? - What happens if I say yes? First of all I'd point out to you that you made a serious mistake- - when you went to see the suspect alone- - without a colleague as a witness, and without informing your superior. Then I'd ask you, if you've been at his place some other time. No, I haven't. Why? Chapter six, in the police regulation- - prevents me from asking further questions. - That goes for your colleagues, too. - You don't mean that... Internal affairs will take over. They'll tell you what you're accused of. Leo Gaut was taken to the emergency ward- -and he accused you of assault. He claims that you... uninvited... broke into his home and threatened him. And since you couldn't arrest him- - you wanted at least beat him black and blue, he says. That's aggravated assault. You must admit that, Falk. You wouldn't call it common assault. - You don't think that I... - There'll be an internal investigation. Kjelle, give me some light! Gaut said that he was hit by this. - So I'm under arrest? - Yes. But the proofs are fabricated! "Aggravated" would be more correct. Johan's fingerprints were all over Leo's living-room. Especially on the buckled cup! I, and many with me, believe in Johan. That's sweet, but this is about legal and not emotional judgments. VIOLENT POLICEMAN KILLED ROBBER Shit! Yeah. It reads... "The policeman, a sergeant at the City police"- - "confirmed yesterday his inclination for assault." "He is suspected of trespassing"- - "and aggravated assault on a man of 40"- - "who was arrested as a suspect of complicity in the robbery"- - "and was released on account of a defective submission of evidence." I believe that I don't have to point out to you- - that Falk must be treated just like any other suspect. The fact that he's a policeman as well- -is of course an aggravating factor. Will you issue a warrant of arrest? Risk of collusion! There's a risk that Falk calls on Gaut again- - and thus obstructs even more the preliminary investigation. Definitely a warrant of arrest! Here you are. Sorry, I have to lock up now. Who shall tell his family? You or we? He's got no family. The investigation has revealed that- - sergeant Falk took an unauthorized measure- -and lacked in judgment- - when he by himself and without notifying his superior- -called on a suspect. He violated the privacy of his home, threatened him- -and in addition assaulted him- - in a way that can only be considered as... aggravated. It was terrible, he was extremely menacing and... He showed... I'd say an almost morbid aggression. He hit me in the face several times. He grabbed the cup... He hit me with all his strength... Right in the face. I fell, but he didn't stop. He kicked me in the chest and so on, and I... I've never been so frightened in my whole life. Falk's fingerprints were on the silver cup. Any blood on it? Yes. And hair from Gaut's head- - where the cup is buckled from many blows. There was another person in Leo Gaut's apartment when I was there. In an adjacent room. That person can affirm that I've never touched Leo Gaut. Well, during the preliminary inquiry we verified this- - and we've found nothing that can confirm Falk's statement. I hereby declare the hearing closed. Sentence will be pronounced in a week. The district court decides that Falk will be detained in custody- -until the sentence gains legal force. - This isn't good. - No. I won't stay in jail one minute, nor a year, for a crime I didn't commit. We haven't seen the sentence yet. Yeah. - What? - We've got to talk. Coffee? Tea? What's up? What's happened? The robber that you killed... His family has offered a reward of 200000- -to the guy who kills you in prison. - But in a maximum security prison... - "Maximum security..." I will of course appeal against... From now on I'm my own lawyer! - Peter! Excuse me... Shit! Don't move! Hell, Johan! Come on! Open up! Help! Come on! Hell, no! - Yes? - I lost him. What? May I have your attention, please? There's something we've been flattering ourselves upon- - within the police authorities in the western Gandhian. Namely that our police force didn't have any black sheep... until... am I forced to add... the present situation. When one of our own is guilty of a criminal act- -and who furthermore has escaped... May I remind you that our principal task- - is to preserve the public's trust in our police force. The capture of Johan Falk has been given top priority. Those of you who consider themselves as friends with Falk- - must be professional enough to ignore their personal feelings. Well, we have 1200 policemen in this town. He'll be found. By us - or by somebody else... - Here, mom. - Oh, it's great! Caroline has drawn a picture for you - on the back of next week's menu. Couldn't we print real menus - with leather cover or something? - Leather cover? - Yes. That's unnecessary, isn't it? People come here only to get an eyeful of the restaurant's sexy owner. There's a call for you. Hello, yes. Do you remember my promise to you? Who is this? I'm gonna get you! When you suspect it the (east you'll be trapped. Hey, wait... - Who was that? - Police. Anja Månsdottir. What do you want? I just want to inform you that Johan Falk has escaped. So, he has escaped! Well, I'll be damned! Do you think he is coming here, or what...? - Well, he's been here before, right? - You're quite right! So, we're offering you police protection. You're entitled to it since you're... a victim. - I don't need protection. - No? How come? He assaulted you, didn't he? He did. Well, we're keeping an eye on you outside, so you don't have to worry. - Good. - If you see anything... Yeah, if I see anything I'll call you at once. Hey... What's your home number? And he's been to Bank of Commerce at Peace Street. He's emptied his bank accounts. He's withdrawn the maximum amount on his American Express. What the hell is he up to? We'll take him before he has the time to do anything. He must be like an animal under stress! He can't put up at a hotel. Customs have been informed. The rental car businesses have Falk's name and social security number. I hope you'll be satisfied, Mr Åkesson. It belonged to my husband. - I most certainly will be... - It has cost me a lot in parking-fees. Which one of us is to report that the car has changed hands? I'll do that. Thanks. Do you find any addresses where he could be? No - only home numbers to colleagues and to their jobs. No addresses to old flames and such... numbers, except for detectives... - "Maria." Do you know her? - Let me see. So, that's her. Maybe he's with her. We ought to pay her a visit. You'll have to dig her up... What? She's been dead for about ten years. 30-50, come in! - 30-50 here, over! Dead stop in the Tingstad tunnel. Two cars demolished. There's an ambulance on the spot. This is 15-21, come in! We' re still at Third Long Street. Any news about Falk? Come in! No, I'm sorry. Månsdottir. - Dare I ask where you are? - I'm in your attic. And you? Are you alone? You're making it worse for yourself. You'd better give yourself up. That'd be better for Leo Gaut, you mean. First I'm gonna find the fucker who was in Leo's apartment. He'll clear me of suspicion and then Leo goes to jail. The penalty is severe for giving false information! There's no proof of such a man and internal affairs... They know fucking shit! When I find him, I 'II force him to give witness. If you find him, he'll be terrified to give witness... I don't give a damn! He should come forward! - If he refuses, I 'II make him do it! - Yeah, a sergeant knows how... I'm not a sergeant any more. I don't need to follow any rules. Johan, listen to me. There are two opinions among your colleagues. Those who hate when a colleague goes off the rails. They'd love to arrest him. And then there are those who believe that you're innocent. They'd rejoice in silence if you got Leo Gaut. What about you? That's not important since we all have orders- - to arrest you, as soon as we see you, even I... 16-90 from 18-42, come in! Don't call again, not until you're prepared to give yourself up. 16-90 from 18-42, come in! 16-90 here, over! They're closing down here now, over! Any news? Over! The answer is no, our colleague hasn't been seen. Leo Gaut and three other men just dosed down the restaurant. Roger, 18-421.! 16-90, come in! 16-90, here. Over! We' re now leaving the stake-out, over! Roger, 18-421. - 15-21, are you still there? Come in! 15-21 here. I see the bartender and two from the kitchen staff. They've locked up and are now leaving the place. It's fucking hell with these cops everywhere. I mean, nobody dares doing business with me any more. I'm like a fucking outcast - people hardly say hello... We'll do like this... Spread the word that I'll pay 50000 cash- - to the person who gets Johan Falk arrested. According to the law whoever wants to... can capture a wanted person. And he's wanted, right? Can vi say that you're paying? Hell, yeah. Absolutely! I mean, I'm not asking for his death. They'll take care of that in the Slammer. I'm here now and the ambulance just left for the hospital. 19-60. We're on The Avenue! Over! No news about Falk. Over! You recognize me, don't you? You know the day I came to see Leo. You know what day I'm talking about. When I came to the apartment, someone was already there, right? Right? I can't give witness! You don't need to, just tell me who it was. Don't say it was his wife! You were close to the stairs, you saw who came up. - Who was it? - A chick. - What's her name? - I don't know. A blonde. We worked together once in one of Leo's other restaurants. When? Six, seven years ago at the Gothenburg Party. What year? The first year - when the party took place at Götaplatsen. The social insurance office, Skansson. Ström from the City police, I'd like names and addresses- - of all women working in a certain restaurant. At (east of those who worked there during the Gothenburg Party in 1993. The passport register, Lena. Good morning - Vogler from the City police... Is anyone of the following persons a blonde? Annika Steen - a blonde! Anna-Carina Andersson - a blonde! - Who wants to get off first? - You'd better put me down first. Yes, Lennart speaking. It's me. The guy from the City police who was charged with assault... He's here. Come quick, so we can arrest him before someone... I recognize you - the local police department three, right? You' re often on night duty, right? - The night before Christmas Day...? - What do you want? Just answer the question! You were in Leo Gaut's apartment, right? - I don't know no fucking... - In the summer of 1993. - He even paid taxes for you! - That's none of your business! Why were you with him on Christmas Day? On Christmas Day?! Hello, Annika, hello! It's me. He's on his way to the bus stop, by the football ground. - He's running down the slope. - Okay. 16-73 here. He's heading down the slope. - He's running towards the bus stop. - Intercept him! I'll take care of Annika. What the hell! I'm not the one you're looking for. I haven't seen Leo Gaut since 1993. I was in Florida during Christmas. You can check it. You know how to do. It's correct. Annika Steen, the local police department three. She was on holiday during Christmas - in Key West, Florida... Okay, thanks. Anna-Carina North Harbor Street - Something happened? - You could say that! Falk is attacking policemen now. What?! He's looking for a woman who worked for Leo Gaut in 1993. And who, according to him, was in Gaut's apartment on Christmas Day. - Yes, this is 12-91. - Okay. In 1993 - he must have had about ten corporations at the time. - We'll have to check all Leo's women. - Yes. Okay, I'll get a list of his employees. What is it? Maybe... No, no... RACING FORM Hello, yes. You recognize my voice, don't you? Yes. I've got information worth ten grand. I'm listening. Johan Falk is looking for a person who can clear him. Someone who were in your apartment- -when Johan assaulted you. I see. Does that person exist? No, but it could be worth ten grand anyway. Good. Okay, thanks. Shit! Don't worry, honey, I've just got a few problems at work, but... It'll be all right! I've got to go. Daddy, I'll be back soon. Dad, you promised to play with me! Do you know who's on the list of Leo Gaut's former employees? - Are they still there? - Yes. You must help me. I can't handle it alone. Are you dragging me into some shit now? Shut up! When I'm well off, you don't complain. You must stand by me now! Back the jeep into the yard and wait for me there. - What are we going to do? - Order new menus. - Don't get tailed! - Where are we going? North Harbor Street, "Inter Commercials". Gaut's wife is leaving in their jeep - alone... Anna-Carina Andersson - Blonde! North Harbor Street 45 - She's not there, she's working. - I see. Where? Up here. - Hi, can I help you? - Yes, I'm looking for Anna-Carina. Anna-Carina... I don't think there's an Anna-Carina here, actually. - Mom, I'm hungry. - We'll eat as soon as we get home. Hi! Nina, go and read your magazine while I have a chat with Johan. Come. What the hell is this? It was you who was in Leo's apartment! Do you work for him? You knew all the time. You saw me but didn't tell! Do you realize what you've done to me? How it feels to be wrongfully detained? - Damn! - I wanted to tell, but I didn't dare to. I checked with a lawyer if you can give witness anonymously... - but you can't. - Of course you can't! If so, people like Leo could eliminate whoever they want... - I've got no choice. - No choice? You decide, don't you? You've got no right to demand anything from Nina and me! Perhaps you'll change when you get a family, children, someone you care for! It's your fault that we've been dragged into this. Instead of taking your stand you've chosen to become a victim. It's because of your mistakes that I haven't got a choice. You've put us in this situation. You shouldn't demand things from me. Now you want me to sacrifice my daughter to save your own skin. Who is Anna-Carina, then? I got the name from the national registration. But it's me! My name is Anna-Carina Helén Andersson- -but everyone calls me Helén. Why then, did I see your name in the stairwell? When I got this job, I came to live here, but I moved recently. How are you involved with Leo Gaut? Except from working in his restaurant? - I'm not involved with Leo Gaut. - But you were in his apartment! - Can I help you? - We're looking for Helén Andersson. I have a restaurant and I'd like to discuss a publicity campaign. - She's busy just now. - We can wait. You can wait over there. Already in the alley, during the shooting, I thought I recognized him. But it wasn't until he broke into our apartment- - and threatened us in our home, that} realized where 1 had seen him. And he realized where he had seen me. - Wait outside. - Then... Instead of hitting me he took out his wallet. I suppose it's easier to pay than threaten someone you know. I was shaking. I was terrified. I don't know how long he stayed. Probably only a few minutes. Then he disappeared. And next day, after you'd come to see us, to give Nina the dolls- - I went to see Leo to give him his money back. He didn't know what to say. He said that something terrible would happen to us, if I talked to the police. Well... You're the only one who can clear me. I can't. I can't do anything! I prefer going to prison for perjury than risking Nina's life. She's all I got. What would you have done? I don't know. You see... I actually don't know. Twelve years ago... a friend of mine was hit by a hit-and-run driver. If I had found him then, I would have killed him... or her. We policemen have a tendency to see everything in black or white. Later on I've been wondering. What if... the hit-and-run driver was ill. On his way to see a doctor... Or maybe he was transporting someone who was dying. Probably not, but it's possible. In that case his behavior can't be entirely condemned. I sometimes think that's the only explanation to such a behavior. If only he had stopped, he could probably have saved my friend. Now she lay there dying in the ditch. How the hell did the driver take it? He must have read in the papers that she died. How is he... or she feeling today? Can he live with what he's done? Well, I don't know. You're scared, right? They've put a price on my head. 200000 to the guy who kills me in prison. - Hi, where is Helén Andersson's room? - Furthest away, to the right. I see, thanks. - Wait here. 14-28 here, we're outside her job now. Over! The police is here. I've got to go. I'll get one of the other witnesses over to my side. That won't help you. No, but you'll be forced to take sides. If you were in my situation you'd lie, too. - Helén? - Yes. We'd like to ask a few questions. Has Johan Falk been here? - Yes. - When? He just left. Did he ask you about your visit to Leo Gaut's apartment? - No, he didn't. - But you were in Gaut's apartment? What then did Johan want? - He wanted me to change my mind. - About your visit to Gaut? - No, about the shooting. - And your statement at the line-up? Yes. - And you agreed to that? - No, I didn't. Do you know if he's been in touch with the other witnesses? Before coming to you... Do you? SHO 1, from 14-28. Over! I want immediate surveillance on two witnesses. One is an Edvin Josefsson, 52 Nordheim Street- - and the other one is a Chen I., 168 Gallery Street. Johan Falk may get in touch with them. How the hell can you remember every person's address? You've got to come down to the police headquarters. We've got to continue with a formal interrogation. - Now? - Yes, right away. - But I can't. My daughter... - Take her with you. You'd better go home, it'll be a long night for me. - Edvin speaking. - Hi. Johan Falk from the police. We've met before. I'd like to speak to you about... Are you really telling the truth now? We all know you're lying, so stop it, for Christ's sake! I won't change my statement from the line-up. We end the interrogation with Helén Andersson... at 15:23. 49-60. 46-90 from 18-42. Come in! We've got three or four busloads with supporters here. Can you send out four prowl cars? Over! Okay, message received. SHO 12-27, posted outside Edvin Josefsson's apartment. Josefsson leaves his apartment, takes his car... Follow him. Keep a look-out for Falk. Arrest him as soon as possible if he turns up. Roger! Bye. Oops! I'd like to talk to her in a more informal situation. You do that. Go home to her and have a chat. It could be worth trying. Yeah, the hard way and rough stuff don't always prove efficient. THE MATCH OF THE YEAR FRÖLUNDA vs AIK - TODAY There's a fight under the information sign. Can a few men take care of that? I'll check around. Josefsson is heading for the men's room. I'm waiting outside. Helén Andersson will pick the perpetrator in the district court. If you remain silent, you can get eight years for perjury. How old will you be when you get out? Is it true? Has she promised to point him out? Give me a hot dog and a beer! No, no sign of Johan Falk yet. - Where is Josefsson now? Over! - He's back in the pub again. Johan Falk is in there. There's a reward for him - 50000! Playing solo seldom pays off, you know. You've got to play as a team. What the fuck is this? It used to be pure meat in the sausages. Now you never know! If this had happened in Kiel, in Värmland- - where almost everyone knows one another- - then everyone would have helped out from the start- -despite threats and shit. In Kiel... There, a guy like... - What's his name again? - Leo Gaut. Leo... he wouldn't have ventured to go out. He'd have got licked. At least that's how it was when I lived there. But nowadays... I don't know. I don't know anybody in Kiel anymore. You're not alone. Help us to get the fucker. What do you say? After five years Edvin and his grandfather are done But someone else must give witness first - either the girl or the Chinese. I'll talk to them. I'm going to check in the bar. Josefsson isn't here. Can you see him? Yeah. I can't come now, maybe after dinner. Remember me? You arrested me three years ago. Now it's my turn. I've made a citizen's arrest. I'm entitled to do 50! He's wanted! - It's Falk. - Yeah, that's him. Make sure to put in the report that Sixten made the citizen's arrest. Sixten, are you in on this? Just make sure it's in the report. Christ, 50000 dollar! Come on... - Hello - Yes, hello, this is Sixten Thorbjörnsson - Sixten who...? - Tattoo-Sixten. What do you want? I've arrested Johan Falk at Scandinavium. You've arrested Johan Falk?! Well, I helped a patrol wagon get him. When can I get the dough? 50 grand, right? - Is it true, Sixten? - Yeah, sure, five minutes ago. You know what will happen if you lie to me. Of course. What was he doing at Scandinavium? He was there with a white-haired old man. I saw them in the john... I don't know what they were up to... So he talked to a white-haired old man... about 65? - Yeah, that's it. - Shit! - Did you hear what they said? - No, but they agreed on something. They shook hands and the old man said he'd decided to give Whitney... Since some girl, Helena or something, also had decided to give Whitney... Okay, good. You'll be hearing from me. Give witness, you half deaf fucking moron! There's a rumor that Leo Gaut is paying 50 grand- -to the guy who gets you arrested. Tattoo-Sum“ won't become “ch today ether. No, we won't be Leo's henchmen. Someone else has to arrest you. There'll be no report. You've got one message. Hi, it's Helén. We've got to talk. Give me a can or come over here. Pm home now. No! I haven't said anything. I promise! I haven't said anything! I haven't said anything! I promise! I haven't... No, don't touch her! Yes, Edvin speaking. What? Chen Li. Listen carefully. No, please stop! Don't! Let me go! Please, stop! What are you doing here? You're supposed to keep watch! Hello! Hello! Helén! Hello! Helén! Anybody home? I'm sorry, but the door... What's happened? Mom... Check the floor below! No, no, no! You're fucking crazy! I'm out! Listen to me, you idiot! We've got to finish this! You get it? Finish it! I haven't said anything. I won't... Please, don't! Police, freeze! Shooting is reported from address 13 Public Road. 14-28 here. At 13 Public Road lives a witness in a... Shit! in a present criminal case. Sergeant Månsdottir is there. Send immediate assistance! I'll be there in a few minutes. - Anja, what the hell... - In... in the shoulder. No! If you give evidence against me... your daughter's dead. Freeze! Freeze! Drop the gun! Drop the gun! Secure the whole block! 17-32 here. Send an ambulance to 13 Public Road. RECEIVED CALLS Can anyone take it? We said you'd never call me. So it's you - Leo's police source... You're a fucking civilian! That explains everything. Yeah, you walk around freely in the police headquarters- - from one unit to another, into the fucking archives, right? Answer me! Why did you do It? How could you go against your colleagues? What the he“ made you do it? Take off the handcuffs. Take them off! I just wanted to order a publicity campaign. Come here. He thinks I've promised the police to designate him at the trial. How can he believe that? My fault, I've... I'm sorry. You learn how easily everything fucks up, when you lie... I will prove that our clients Leo Gaut and Hans Osterlundh are innocent. Leo Gaut came to order a publicity campaign from Helén Andersson. He went to see her in her apartment, accompanied by two bodyguards- - who would protect him from Johan Falk. The bodyguards were armed. Osterlundh admits that. But Osterlundh was assaulted by Falk who took his gun. Falk started to fire shots at Gaut. The second bodyguard who later died- -after having been shot by Falk- - returned the fire and shot by mistake a female sergeant. Johan Falk has already before given testimony- -and his intention is to nail my client. He's been trying to do that ever since he assaulted Gaut. Helén Andersson, please come to room 5. I Helén Andersson, solemnly declare- - that I'll tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Can you point him out? Yes, that's him. Leo Gaut. On Christmas Eve... He was the other perpetrator at the shooting. He threatened me and my daughter in our home- -and forced us to lie to the police. He tried to kill me, to smother me... I didn't dare to say that I'd seen that Johan Falk never assaulted Leo Gaut. Thank you. Let us now take it point by point, and look into it in detail. That's the man who was shooting in the alley. He shot the man who was dressed as Santa Claus - in the back! That's him, I'm certain. Violation of a legal case, as threatening a witness is called- - is the most serious threat, in times of peace, against democracy. I thank all of you who have shown courage to stand up for your beliefs- - who have acted with moral sense, unselfishly- - and made it possible for the law to function... Sentence will be pronounced in a week. What do we do now? Nothing. Well, what will happen now? What will happen to me? I don't know. But... well.. What did you say to Johan? Let's get something to eat.
